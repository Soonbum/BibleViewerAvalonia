05Dt 1:1 In this book are the words that Moses spoke to the people of Israel when they were in the wilderness east of the Jordan River. They were in the Jordan Valley near Suph, between the town of Paran on one side and the towns of Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Dizahab on the other. 
05Dt 1:2 (It takes eleven days to travel from Mount Sinai to Kadesh Barnea by way of the hill country of Edom.) 
05Dt 1:3 On the first day of the eleventh month of the fortieth year after they had left Egypt, Moses told the people everything the LORD had commanded him to tell them. 
05Dt 1:4 This was after the LORD had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in the town of Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who ruled in the towns of Ashtaroth and Edrei. 
05Dt 1:5 It was while the people were east of the Jordan in the territory of Moab that Moses began to explain God's laws and teachings. He said, 
05Dt 1:6 "When we were at Mount Sinai, the LORD our God said to us, 'You have stayed long enough at this mountain. 
05Dt 1:7 Break camp and move on. Go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the surrounding regions - to the Jordan Valley, to the hill country and the lowlands, to the southern region, and to the Mediterranean coast. Go to the land of Canaan and on beyond the Lebanon Mountains as far as the great Euphrates River. 
05Dt 1:8 All of this is the land which I, the LORD, promised to give to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to their descendants. Go and occupy it.' " 
05Dt 1:9 Moses said to the people, "While we were still at Mount Sinai, I told you, 'The responsibility for leading you is too much for me. I can't do it alone. 
05Dt 1:10 The LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky. 
05Dt 1:11 May the LORD, the God of your ancestors, make you increase a thousand times more and make you prosperous, as he promised! 
05Dt 1:12 But how can I alone bear the heavy responsibility for settling your disputes? 
05Dt 1:13 Choose some wise, understanding, and experienced men from each tribe, and I will put them in charge of you.' 
05Dt 1:14 And you agreed that this was a good thing to do. 
05Dt 1:15 So I took the wise and experienced leaders you chose from your tribes, and I placed them in charge of you. Some were responsible for a thousand people, some for a hundred, some for fifty, and some for ten. I also appointed other officials throughout the tribes. 
05Dt 1:16 "At that time I instructed them, 'Listen to the disputes that come up among your people. Judge every dispute fairly, whether it concerns only your own people or involves foreigners who live among you. 
05Dt 1:17 Show no partiality in your decisions; judge everyone on the same basis, no matter who they are. Do not be afraid of anyone, for the decisions you make come from God. If any case is too difficult for you, bring it to me, and I will decide it.' 
05Dt 1:18 At the same time I gave you instructions for everything else you were to do. 
05Dt 1:19 "We did what the LORD our God commanded us. We left Mount Sinai and went through that vast and fearful desert on the way to the hill country of the Amorites. When we reached Kadesh Barnea, 
05Dt 1:20 I told you, 'You have now come to the hill country of the Amorites, which the LORD our God, the God of our ancestors, is giving us. 
05Dt 1:21 Look, there it is. Go and occupy it as he commanded. Do not hesitate or be afraid.' 
05Dt 1:22 "But you came to me and said, 'Let's send men ahead of us to spy out the land, so that they can tell us the best route to take and what kind of cities are there.' 
05Dt 1:23 "That seemed like a good thing to do, so I selected twelve men, one from each tribe. 
05Dt 1:24 They went into the hill country as far as Eshcol Valley and explored it. 
05Dt 1:25 They brought us back some fruit they found there, and reported that the land which the LORD our God was giving us was very fertile. 
05Dt 1:26 "But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God, and you would not enter the land. 
05Dt 1:27 You grumbled to one another: 'The LORD hates us. He brought us out of Egypt just to hand us over to these Amorites, so that they could kill us. 
05Dt 1:28 Why should we go there? We are afraid. The men we sent tell us that the people there are stronger and taller than we are, and that they live in cities with walls that reach the sky. They saw giants there!' 
05Dt 1:29 "But I told you, 'Don't be afraid of those people. 
05Dt 1:30 The LORD your God will lead you, and he will fight for you, just as you saw him do in Egypt 
05Dt 1:31 and in the desert. You saw how he brought you safely all the way to this place, just as a father would carry his son.' 
05Dt 1:32 But in spite of what I said, you still would not trust the LORD, 
05Dt 1:33 even though he always went ahead of you to find a place for you to camp. To show you the way, he went in front of you in a pillar of fire by night and in a pillar of cloud by day. 
05Dt 1:34 "The LORD heard your complaints and became angry, and so he solemnly declared, 
05Dt 1:35 'Not one of you from this evil generation will enter the fertile land that I promised to give your ancestors. 
05Dt 1:36 Only Caleb son of Jephunneh will enter it. He has remained faithful to me, and I will give him and his descendants the land that he has explored.' 
05Dt 1:37 Because of you the LORD also became angry with me and said, 'Not even you, Moses, will enter the land. 
05Dt 1:38 But strengthen the determination of your helper, Joshua son of Nun. He will lead Israel to occupy the land.' 
05Dt 1:39 "Then the LORD said to all of us, 'Your children, who are still too young to know right from wrong, will enter the land - the children you said would be seized by your enemies. I will give the land to them, and they will occupy it. 
05Dt 1:40 But as for you people, turn around and go back into the desert on the road to the Gulf of Aqaba.' 
05Dt 1:41 "You replied, 'Moses, we have sinned against the LORD. But now we will attack, just as the LORD our God commanded us.' Then each one of you got ready to fight, thinking it would be easy to invade the hill country. 
05Dt 1:42 "But the LORD said to me, 'Warn them not to attack, for I will not be with them, and their enemies will defeat them.' 
05Dt 1:43 I told you what the LORD had said, but you paid no attention. You rebelled against him, and in your pride you marched into the hill country. 
05Dt 1:44 Then the Amorites who lived in those hills came out against you like a swarm of bees. They chased you as far as Hormah and defeated you there in the hill country of Edom. 
05Dt 1:45 So you cried out to the LORD for help, but he would not listen to you or pay any attention to you. 
05Dt 1:46 "So then, after we had stayed at Kadesh for a long time, 
05Dt 2:1 we finally turned and went into the desert, on the road to the Gulf of Aqaba, as the LORD had commanded, and we spent a long time wandering about in the hill country of Edom. 
05Dt 2:2 "Then the LORD told me 
05Dt 2:3 that we had spent enough time wandering about in those hills and that we should go north. 
05Dt 2:4 He told me to give you the following instructions 'You are about to go through the hill country of Edom, the territory of your distant relatives, the descendants of Esau. They will be afraid of you, 
05Dt 2:5 but you must not start a war with them, because I am not going to give you so much as a square foot of their land. I have given Edom to Esau's descendants. 
05Dt 2:6 You may buy food and water from them.' 
05Dt 2:7 "Remember how the LORD your God has blessed you in everything that you have done. He has taken care of you as you wandered through this vast desert. He has been with you these forty years, and you have had everything you needed. 
05Dt 2:8 "So we moved on and left the road that goes from the towns of Elath and Eziongeber to the Dead Sea, and we turned northeast toward Moab. 
05Dt 2:9 The LORD said to me, 'Don't trouble the people of Moab, the descendants of Lot, or start a war against them. I have given them the city of Ar, and I am not going to give you any of their land.' " 
05Dt 2:10 (A mighty race of giants called the Emim used to live in Ar. They were as tall as the Anakim, another race of giants. 
05Dt 2:11 Like the Anakim they were also known as Rephaim; but the Moabites called them Emim. 
05Dt 2:12 The Horites used to live in Edom, but the descendants of Esau chased them out, destroyed their nation, and settled there themselves, just as the Israelites later chased their enemies out of the land that the LORD gave them.) 
05Dt 2:13 "Then we crossed the Zered River as the LORD told us to do. 
05Dt 2:14 This was thirty-eight years after we had left Kadesh Barnea. All the fighting men of that generation had died, as the LORD had said they would. 
05Dt 2:15 The LORD kept on opposing them until he had destroyed them all. 
05Dt 2:16 "After they had all died, 
05Dt 2:17 the LORD said to us, 
05Dt 2:18 'Today you are to pass through the territory of Moab by way of Ar. 
05Dt 2:19 You will then be near the land of the Ammonites, the descendants of Lot. Don't trouble them or start a war against them, because I am not going to give you any of the land that I have given them.' " 
05Dt 2:20 (This territory is also known as the land of the Rephaim, the name of the people who used to live there; the Ammonites called them Zamzummim. 
05Dt 2:21 They were as tall as the Anakim. There were many of them, and they were a mighty race. But the LORD destroyed them, so that the Ammonites took over their land and settled there. 
05Dt 2:22 The LORD had done the same thing for the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, who live in the hill country of Edom. He destroyed the Horites, so that the Edomites took over their land and settled there, where they still live. 
05Dt 2:23 The land along the Mediterranean coast had been settled by people from the island of Crete. They had destroyed the Avvim, the original inhabitants, and had taken over all their land as far south as the city of Gaza.) 
05Dt 2:24 "After we had passed through Moab, the LORD told us, 'Now, start out and cross the Arnon River. I am placing in your power Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, along with his land. Attack him, and begin occupying his land. 
05Dt 2:25 From today on I will make people everywhere afraid of you. Everyone will tremble with fear at the mention of your name.' 
05Dt 2:26 "Then I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to King Sihon of Heshbon with the following offer of peace�� 05Dt 2:27 'Let us pass through your country. We will go straight through and not leave the road. 
05Dt 2:28 We will pay for the food we eat and the water we drink. All we want to do is to pass through your country, 
05Dt 2:29 until we cross the Jordan River into the land that the LORD our God is giving us. The descendants of Esau, who live in Edom, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, allowed us to pass through their territory.' 
05Dt 2:30 "But King Sihon would not let us pass through his country. The LORD your God had made him stubborn and rebellious, so that we could defeat him and take his territory, which we still occupy. 
05Dt 2:31 "Then the LORD said to me, 'Look, I have made King Sihon and his land helpless before you; take his land and occupy it.' 
05Dt 2:32 Sihon came out with all his men to fight us near the town of Jahaz, 
05Dt 2:33 but the LORD our God put him in our power, and we killed him, his sons, and all his men. 
05Dt 2:34 At the same time we captured and destroyed every town, and put everyone to death, men, women, and children. We left no survivors. 
05Dt 2:35 We took the livestock and plundered the towns. 
05Dt 2:36 The LORD our God let us capture all the towns from Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon Valley, and the city in the middle of that valley, all the way to Gilead. No town had walls too strong for us. 
05Dt 2:37 But we did not go near the territory of the Ammonites or to the banks of the Jabbok River or to the towns of the hill country or to any other place where the LORD our God had commanded us not to go. 
05Dt 3:1 "Next, we moved north toward the region of Bashan, and King Og came out with all his men to fight us near the town of Edrei. 
05Dt 3:2 But the LORD said to me, 'Don't be afraid of him. I am going to give him, his men, and all his territory to you. Do the same thing to him that you did to Sihon the Amorite king who ruled in Heshbon.' 
05Dt 3:3 "So the LORD also placed King Og and his people in our power, and we slaughtered them all. 
05Dt 3:4 At the same time we captured all his towns - there was not one that we did not take. In all we captured sixty towns - the whole region of Argob, where King Og of Bashan ruled. 
05Dt 3:5 All these towns were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars to lock the gates, and there were also many villages without walls. 
05Dt 3:6 We destroyed all the towns and put to death all the men, women, and children, just as we did in the towns that belonged to King Sihon of Heshbon. 
05Dt 3:7 We took the livestock and plundered the towns. 
05Dt 3:8 "At that time we took from those two Amorite kings the land east of the Jordan River, from the Arnon River to Mount Hermon. 
05Dt 3:9 (Mount Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians, and Senir by the Amorites.) 
05Dt 3:10 We took all the territory of King Og of Bashan: the cities on the plateau, the regions of Gilead and of Bashan, as far east as the towns of Salecah and Edrei." 
05Dt 3:11 (King Og was the last of the Rephaim. His coffin, made of stone, was six feet wide and almost fourteen feet long, according to standard measurements. It can still be seen in the Ammonite city of Rabbah.) 
05Dt 3:12 "When we took possession of the land, I assigned to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the territory north of the town of Aroer near the Arnon River and part of the hill country of Gilead, along with its towns. 
05Dt 3:13 To half the tribe of Manasseh I assigned the rest of Gilead and also all of Bashan, where Og had ruled, that is, the entire Argob region." (Bashan was known as the land of the Rephaim. 
05Dt 3:14 Jair, from the tribe of Manasseh, took the entire region of Argob, that is, Bashan, as far as the border of Geshur and Maacah. He named the villages after himself, and they are still known as the villages of Jair.) 
05Dt 3:15 "I assigned Gilead to the clan of Machir of the tribe of Manasseh. 
05Dt 3:16 And to the tribes of Reuben and Gad I assigned the territory from Gilead to the Arnon River. The middle of the river was their southern boundary, and their northern boundary was the Jabbok River, part of which formed the Ammonite border. 
05Dt 3:17 On the west their territory extended to the Jordan River, from Lake Galilee in the north down to the Dead Sea in the south and to the foot of Mount Pisgah on the east. 
05Dt 3:18 "At the same time, I gave them the following instructions: 'The LORD our God has given you this land east of the Jordan to occupy. Now arm your fighting men and send them across the Jordan ahead of the other tribes of Israel, to help them occupy their land. 
05Dt 3:19 Only your wives, children, and livestock - I know you have a lot of livestock - will remain behind in the towns that I have assigned to you. 
05Dt 3:20 Help the other Israelites until they occupy the land that the LORD is giving them west of the Jordan and until the LORD lets them live there in peace, as he has already done here for you. After that, you may return to this land that I have assigned to you.' 
05Dt 3:21 "Then I instructed Joshua: 'You have seen all that the LORD your God did to those two kings, Sihon and Og; and he will do the same thing to everyone else whose land you invade. 
05Dt 3:22 Don't be afraid of them, for the LORD your God will fight for you.' 
05Dt 3:23 "At that time I earnestly prayed, 
05Dt 3:24 'Sovereign LORD, I know that you have shown me only the beginning of the great and wonderful things you are going to do. There is no god in heaven or on earth who can do the mighty things that you have done! 
05Dt 3:25 Let me cross the Jordan River, LORD, and see the fertile land on the other side, the beautiful hill country and the Lebanon Mountains.' 
05Dt 3:26 "But because of you people the LORD was angry with me and would not listen. Instead, he said, 'That's enough! Don't mention this again! 
05Dt 3:27 Go to the peak of Mount Pisgah and look to the north and to the south, to the east and to the west. Look carefully at what you see, because you will never go across the Jordan. 
05Dt 3:28 Give Joshua his instructions. Strengthen his determination, because he will lead the people across to occupy the land that you see.' 
05Dt 3:29 "So we remained in the valley opposite the town of Bethpeor." 
05Dt 4:1 Then Moses said to the people, "Obey all the laws that I am teaching you, and you will live and occupy the land which the LORD, the God of your ancestors, is giving you. 
05Dt 4:2 Do not add anything to what I command you, and do not take anything away. Obey the commands of the LORD your God that I have given you. 
05Dt 4:3 You yourselves saw what the LORD did at Mount Peor. He destroyed everyone who worshiped Baal there, 
05Dt 4:4 but those of you who were faithful to the LORD your God are still alive today. 
05Dt 4:5 "I have taught you all the laws, as the LORD my God told me to do. Obey them in the land that you are about to invade and occupy. 
05Dt 4:6 Obey them faithfully, and this will show the people of other nations how wise you are. When they hear of all these laws, they will say, 'What wisdom and understanding this great nation has!' 
05Dt 4:7 "No other nation, no matter how great, has a god who is so near when they need him as the LORD our God is to us. He answers us whenever we call for help. 
05Dt 4:8 No other nation, no matter how great, has laws so just as those that I have taught you today. 
05Dt 4:9 Be on your guard! Make certain that you do not forget, as long as you live, what you have seen with your own eyes. Tell your children and your grandchildren 
05Dt 4:10 about the day you stood in the presence of the LORD your God at Mount Sinai, when he said to me, 'Assemble the people. I want them to hear what I have to say, so that they will learn to obey me as long as they live and so that they will teach their children to do the same.' 
05Dt 4:11 "Tell your children how you went and stood at the foot of the mountain which was covered with thick clouds of dark smoke and fire blazing up to the sky. 
05Dt 4:12 Tell them how the LORD spoke to you from the fire, how you heard him speaking but did not see him in any form at all. 
05Dt 4:13 He told you what you must do to keep the covenant he made with you - you must obey the Ten Commandments, which he wrote on two stone tablets. 
05Dt 4:14 The LORD told me to teach you all the laws that you are to obey in the land that you are about to invade and occupy. 
05Dt 4:15 "When the LORD spoke to you from the fire on Mount Sinai, you did not see any form. For your own good, then, make certain 
05Dt 4:16 that you do not sin by making for yourselves an idol in any form at all - whether man or woman, 
05Dt 4:17 animal or bird, 
05Dt 4:18 reptile or fish. 
05Dt 4:19 Do not be tempted to worship and serve what you see in the sky - the sun, the moon, and the stars. The LORD your God has given these to all other peoples for them to worship. 
05Dt 4:20 But you are the people he rescued from Egypt, that blazing furnace. He brought you out to make you his own people, as you are today. 
05Dt 4:21 Because of you the LORD your God was angry with me and solemnly declared that I would not cross the Jordan River to enter the fertile land which he is giving you. 
05Dt 4:22 I will die in this land and never cross the river, but you are about to go across and occupy that fertile land. 
05Dt 4:23 Be certain that you do not forget the covenant that the LORD your God made with you. Obey his command not to make yourselves any kind of idol, 
05Dt 4:24 because the LORD your God is like a flaming fire; he tolerates no rivals. 
05Dt 4:25 "Even when you have been in the land a long time and have children and grandchildren, do not sin by making for yourselves an idol in any form at all. This is evil in the LORD's sight, and it will make him angry. 
05Dt 4:26 I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today that, if you disobey me, you will soon disappear from the land. You will not live very long in the land across the Jordan that you are about to occupy. You will be completely destroyed. 
05Dt 4:27 The LORD will scatter you among other nations, where only a few of you will survive. 
05Dt 4:28 There you will serve gods made by human hands, gods of wood and stone, gods that cannot see or hear, eat or smell. 
05Dt 4:29 There you will look for the LORD your God, and if you search for him with all your heart, you will find him. 
05Dt 4:30 When you are in trouble and all those things happen to you, then you will finally turn to the LORD and obey him. 
05Dt 4:31 He is a merciful God. He will not abandon you or destroy you, and he will not forget the covenant that he himself made with your ancestors. 
05Dt 4:32 "Search the past, the time before you were born, all the way back to the time when God created human beings on the earth. Search the entire earth. Has anything as great as this ever happened before? Has anyone ever heard of anything like this? 
05Dt 4:33 Have any people ever lived after hearing a god speak to them from a fire, as you have? 
05Dt 4:34 Has any god ever dared to go and take a people from another nation and make them his own, as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt? Before your very eyes he used his great power and strength; he brought plagues and war, worked miracles and wonders, and caused terrifying things to happen. 
05Dt 4:35 The LORD has shown you this, to prove to you that he alone is God and that there is no other. 
05Dt 4:36 He let you hear his voice from heaven so that he could instruct you; and here on earth he let you see his holy fire, and he spoke to you from it. 
05Dt 4:37 Because he loved your ancestors, he chose you, and by his great power he himself brought you out of Egypt. 
05Dt 4:38 As you advanced, he drove out nations greater and more powerful than you, so that he might bring you in and give you their land, the land which still belongs to you. 
05Dt 4:39 So remember today and never forget: the LORD is God in heaven and on earth. There is no other god. 
05Dt 4:40 Obey all his laws that I have given you today, and all will go well with you and your descendants. You will continue to live in the land that the LORD your God is giving you to be yours forever." 
05Dt 4:41 Then Moses set aside three cities east of the Jordan River 
05Dt 4:42 to which a man could escape and be safe if he had accidentally killed someone who had not been his enemy. He could escape to one of these cities and not be put to death. 
05Dt 4:43 For the tribe of Reuben there was the city of Bezer, on the desert plateau; for the tribe of Gad there was Ramoth, in the territory of Gilead; and for the tribe of Manasseh there was Golan, in the territory of Bashan. 
05Dt 4:44 Moses gave God's laws and teachings to the people of Israel. 
05Dt 4:45 It was after they had come out of Egypt and were in the valley east of the Jordan River, opposite the town of Bethpeor, that he gave them these laws. This was in the territory that had belonged to King Sihon of the Amorites, who had ruled in the town of Heshbon.
05Dt 4:46 Moses and the people of Israel defeated him when they came out of Egypt. 
05Dt 4:47 They occupied his land and the land of King Og of Bashan, the other Amorite king who lived east of the Jordan. 
05Dt 4:48 This land extended from the town of Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon River, all the way north to Mount Sirion, that is, Mount Hermon. 
05Dt 4:49 It also included all the region east of the Jordan River as far south as the Dead Sea and east to the foot of Mount Pisgah. 
05Dt 5:1 Moses called together all the people of Israel and said to them, "People of Israel, listen to all the laws that I am giving you today. Learn them and be sure that you obey them. 
05Dt 5:2 At Mount Sinai the LORD our God made a covenant, 
05Dt 5:3 not only with our fathers, but with all of us who are living today. 
05Dt 5:4 There on the mountain the LORD spoke to you face-to-face from the fire. 
05Dt 5:5 I stood between you and the LORD at that time to tell you what he said, because you were afraid of the fire and would not go up the mountain. "The LORD said, 
05Dt 5:6 'I am the LORD your God, who rescued you from Egypt, where you were slaves. 
05Dt 5:7 " 'Worship no god but me. 
05Dt 5:8 " 'Do not make for yourselves images of anything in heaven or on earth or in the water under the earth. 
05Dt 5:9 Do not bow down to any idol or worship it, for I am the LORD your God and I tolerate no rivals. I bring punishment on those who hate me and on their descendants down to the third and fourth generation. 
05Dt 5:10 But I show my love to thousands of generations of those who love me and obey my laws. 
05Dt 5:11 " 'Do not use my name for evil purposes, for I, the LORD your God, will punish anyone who misuses my name. 
05Dt 5:12 " 'Observe the Sabbath and keep it holy, as I, the LORD your God, have commanded you. 
05Dt 5:13 You have six days in which to do your work, 
05Dt 5:14 but the seventh day is a day of rest dedicated to me. On that day no one is to work - neither you, your children, your slaves, your animals, nor the foreigners who live in your country. Your slaves must rest just as you do. 
05Dt 5:15 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, and that I, the LORD your God, rescued you by my great power and strength. That is why I command you to observe the Sabbath. 
05Dt 5:16 " 'Respect your father and your mother, as I, the LORD your God, command you, so that all may go well with you and so that you may live a long time in the land that I am giving you. 
05Dt 5:17 " 'Do not commit murder. 
05Dt 5:18 " 'Do not commit adultery. 
05Dt 5:19 " 'Do not steal. 
05Dt 5:20 " 'Do not accuse anyone falsely. 
05Dt 5:21 " 'Do not desire another man's wife; do not desire his house, his land, his slaves, his cattle, his donkeys, or anything else that he owns.' 
05Dt 5:22 "These are the commandments the LORD gave to all of you when you were gathered at the mountain. When he spoke with a mighty voice from the fire and from the thick clouds, he gave these commandments and no others. Then he wrote them on two stone tablets and gave them to me. 
05Dt 5:23 "When the whole mountain was on fire and you heard the voice from the darkness, your leaders and the chiefs of your tribes came to me 
05Dt 5:24 and said, 'The LORD our God showed us his greatness and his glory when we heard him speak from the fire! Today we have seen that it is possible for people to continue to live, even though God has spoken to them. 
05Dt 5:25 But why should we risk death again? That terrible fire will destroy us. We are sure to die if we hear the LORD our God speak again. 
05Dt 5:26 Has any human being ever lived after hearing the living God speak from a fire? 
05Dt 5:27 Go back, Moses, and listen to everything that the LORD our God says. Then return and tell us what he said to you. We will listen and obey.' 
05Dt 5:28 "When the LORD heard this, he said to me, 'I have heard what these people said, and they are right. 
05Dt 5:29 If only they would always feel this way! If only they would always honor me and obey all my commands, so that everything would go well with them and their descendants forever. 
05Dt 5:30 Go and tell them to return to their tents. 
05Dt 5:31 But you, Moses, stay here with me, and I will give you all my laws and commands. Teach them to the people, so that they will obey them in the land that I am giving them.' 
05Dt 5:32 "People of Israel, be sure that you do everything that the LORD your God has commanded you. Do not disobey any of his laws. 
05Dt 5:33 Obey them all, so that everything will go well with you and so that you will continue to live in the land that you are going to occupy. 
05Dt 6:1 "These are all the laws that the LORD your God commanded me to teach you. Obey them in the land that you are about to enter and occupy. 
05Dt 6:2 As long as you live, you and your descendants are to honor the LORD your God and obey all his laws that I am giving you, so that you may live in that land a long time. 
05Dt 6:3 Listen to them, people of Israel, and obey them! Then all will go well with you, and you will become a mighty nation and live in that rich and fertile land, just as the LORD, the God of our ancestors, has promised. 
05Dt 6:4 "Israel, remember this! The LORD - and the LORD alone - is our God. 
05Dt 6:5 Love the LORD your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength. 
05Dt 6:6 Never forget these commands that I am giving you today. 
05Dt 6:7 Teach them to your children. Repeat them when you are at home and when you are away, when you are resting and when you are working. 
05Dt 6:8 Tie them on your arms and wear them on your foreheads as a reminder. 
05Dt 6:9 Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates. 
05Dt 6:10 "Just as the LORD your God promised your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he will give you a land with large and prosperous cities which you did not build. 
05Dt 6:11 The houses will be full of good things which you did not put in them, and there will be wells that you did not dig, and vineyards and olive orchards that you did not plant. When the LORD brings you into this land and you have all you want to eat, 
05Dt 6:12 make certain that you do not forget the LORD who rescued you from Egypt, where you were slaves. 
05Dt 6:13 Honor the LORD your God, worship only him, and make your promises in his name alone. 
05Dt 6:14 Do not worship other gods, any of the gods of the peoples around you. 
05Dt 6:15 If you do worship other gods, the LORD's anger will come against you like fire and will destroy you completely, because the LORD your God, who is present with you, tolerates no rivals. 
05Dt 6:16 "Do not put the LORD your God to the test, as you did at Massah. 
05Dt 6:17 Be sure that you obey all the laws that he has given you. 
05Dt 6:18 Do what the LORD says is right and good, and all will go well with you. You will be able to take possession of the fertile land that the LORD promised your ancestors, 
05Dt 6:19 and you will drive out your enemies, as he promised. 
05Dt 6:20 "In times to come your children will ask you, 'Why did the LORD our God command us to obey all these laws?' 
05Dt 6:21 Then tell them, 'We were slaves of the king of Egypt, and the LORD rescued us by his great power. 
05Dt 6:22 With our own eyes we saw him work miracles and do terrifying things to the Egyptians and to their king and to all his officials. 
05Dt 6:23 He freed us from Egypt to bring us here and give us this land, as he had promised our ancestors he would. 
05Dt 6:24 Then the LORD our God commanded us to obey all these laws and to honor him. If we do, he will always watch over our nation and keep it prosperous. 
05Dt 6:25 If we faithfully obey everything that God has commanded us, he will be pleased with us.' 
05Dt 7:1 "The LORD your God will bring you into the land that you are going to occupy, and he will drive many nations out of it. As you advance, he will drive out seven nations larger and more powerful than you: the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
05Dt 7:2 When the LORD your God places these people in your power and you defeat them, you must put them all to death. Do not make an alliance with them or show them any mercy. 
05Dt 7:3 Do not marry any of them, and do not let your children marry any of them, 
05Dt 7:4 because then they would lead your children away from the LORD to worship other gods. If that happens, the LORD will be angry with you and destroy you at once. 
05Dt 7:5 So then, tear down their altars, break their sacred stone pillars in pieces, cut down their symbols of the goddess Asherah, and burn their idols. 
05Dt 7:6 Do this because you belong to the LORD your God. From all the peoples on earth he chose you to be his own special people. 
05Dt 7:7 "The LORD did not love you and choose you because you outnumbered other peoples; you were the smallest nation on earth. 
05Dt 7:8 But the LORD loved you and wanted to keep the promise that he made to your ancestors. That is why he saved you by his great might and set you free from slavery to the king of Egypt. 
05Dt 7:9 Remember that the LORD your God is the only God and that he is faithful. He will keep his covenant and show his constant love to a thousand generations of those who love him and obey his commands, 
05Dt 7:10 but he will not hesitate to punish those who hate him. 
05Dt 7:11 Now then, obey what you have been taught; obey all the laws that I have given you today. 
05Dt 7:12 "If you listen to these commands and obey them faithfully, then the LORD your God will continue to keep his covenant with you and will show you his constant love, as he promised your ancestors. 
05Dt 7:13 He will love you and bless you, so that you will increase in number and have many children; he will bless your fields, so that you will have grain, wine, and olive oil; and he will bless you by giving you many cattle and sheep. He will give you all these blessings in the land that he promised your ancestors he would give to you. 
05Dt 7:14 No people in the world will be as richly blessed as you. None of you nor any of your livestock will be sterile. 
05Dt 7:15 The LORD will protect you from all sickness, and he will not bring on you any of the dreadful diseases that you experienced in Egypt, but he will bring them on all your enemies. 
05Dt 7:16 Destroy every nation that the LORD your God places in your power, and do not show them any mercy. Do not worship their gods, for that would be fatal. 
05Dt 7:17 "Do not tell yourselves that these peoples outnumber you and that you cannot drive them out. 
05Dt 7:18 Do not be afraid of them; remember what the LORD your God did to the king of Egypt and to all his people. 
05Dt 7:19 Remember the terrible plagues that you saw with your own eyes, the miracles and wonders, and the great power and strength by which the LORD your God set you free. In the same way that he destroyed the Egyptians, he will destroy all these people that you now fear. 
05Dt 7:20 He will even cause panic among them and will destroy those who escape and go into hiding. 
05Dt 7:21 So do not be afraid of these people. The LORD your God is with you; he is a great God and one to be feared. 
05Dt 7:22 Little by little he will drive out these nations as you advance. You will not be able to destroy them all at once, for, if you did, the number of wild animals would increase and be a threat to you. 
05Dt 7:23 The LORD will put your enemies in your power and make them panic until they are destroyed. 
05Dt 7:24 He will put their kings in your power. You will kill them, and they will be forgotten. No one will be able to stop you; you will destroy everyone. 
05Dt 7:25 Burn their idols. Do not desire the silver or gold that is on them, and do not take it for yourselves. If you do, that will be fatal, because the LORD hates idolatry. 
05Dt 7:26 Do not bring any of these idols into your homes, or the same curse will be on you that is on them. You must hate and despise these idols, because they are under the LORD's curse. 
05Dt 8:1 "Obey faithfully all the laws that I have given you today, so that you may live, increase in number, and occupy the land that the LORD promised to your ancestors. 
05Dt 8:2 Remember how the LORD your God led you on this long journey through the desert these past forty years, sending hardships to test you, so that he might know what you intended to do and whether you would obey his commands. 
05Dt 8:3 He made you go hungry, and then he gave you manna to eat, food that you and your ancestors had never eaten before. He did this to teach you that you must not depend on bread alone to sustain you, but on everything that the LORD says. 
05Dt 8:4 During these forty years your clothes have not worn out, nor have your feet swollen up. 
05Dt 8:5 Remember that the LORD your God corrects and punishes you just as parents discipline their children. 
05Dt 8:6 So then, do as the LORD has commanded you: live according to his laws and obey him. 
05Dt 8:7 The LORD your God is bringing you into a fertile land - a land that has rivers and springs, and underground streams gushing out into the valleys and hills; 
05Dt 8:8 a land that produces wheat and barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives, and honey. 
05Dt 8:9 There you will never go hungry or ever be in need. Its rocks have iron in them, and from its hills you can mine copper. 
05Dt 8:10 You will have all you want to eat, and you will give thanks to the LORD your God for the fertile land that he has given you. 
05Dt 8:11 "Make certain that you do not forget the LORD your God; do not fail to obey any of his laws that I am giving you today. 
05Dt 8:12 When you have all you want to eat and have built good houses to live in 
05Dt 8:13 and when your cattle and sheep, your silver and gold, and all your other possessions have increased, 
05Dt 8:14 be sure that you do not become proud and forget the LORD your God who rescued you from Egypt, where you were slaves. 
05Dt 8:15 He led you through that vast and terrifying desert where there were poisonous snakes and scorpions. In that dry and waterless land he made water flow out of solid rock for you. 
05Dt 8:16 In the desert he gave you manna to eat, food that your ancestors had never eaten. He sent hardships on you to test you, so that in the end he could bless you with good things. 
05Dt 8:17 So then, you must never think that you have made yourselves wealthy by your own power and strength. 
05Dt 8:18 Remember that it is the LORD your God who gives you the power to become rich. He does this because he is still faithful today to the covenant that he made with your ancestors. 
05Dt 8:19 Never forget the LORD your God or turn to other gods to worship and serve them. If you do, then I warn you today that you will certainly be destroyed. 
05Dt 8:20 If you do not obey the LORD, then you will be destroyed just like those nations that he is going to destroy as you advance. 
05Dt 9:1 "Listen, people of Israel! Today you are about to cross the Jordan River and occupy the land belonging to nations greater and more powerful than you. Their cities are large, with walls that reach the sky. 
05Dt 9:2 The people themselves are tall and strong; they are giants, and you have heard it said that no one can stand against them. 
05Dt 9:3 But now you will see for yourselves that the LORD your God will go ahead of you like a raging fire. He will defeat them as you advance, so that you will drive them out and destroy them quickly, as he promised. 
05Dt 9:4 "After the LORD your God has driven them out for you, do not say to yourselves that he brought you in to possess this land because you deserved it. No, the LORD is going to drive these people out for you because they are wicked. 
05Dt 9:5 It is not because you are good and do what is right that the LORD is letting you take their land. He will drive them out because they are wicked and because he intends to keep the promise that he made to your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
05Dt 9:6 You can be sure that the LORD is not giving you this fertile land because you deserve it. No, you are a stubborn people. 
05Dt 9:7 "Never forget how you made the LORD your God angry in the desert. From the day that you left Egypt until the day you arrived here, you have rebelled against him. 
05Dt 9:8 Even at Mount Sinai you made the LORD angry - angry enough to destroy you. 
05Dt 9:9 I went up the mountain to receive the stone tablets on which was written the covenant that the LORD had made with you. I stayed there forty days and nights and did not eat or drink anything. 
05Dt 9:10 Then the LORD gave me the two stone tablets on which he had written with his own hand what he had said to you from the fire on the day that you were gathered there at the mountain. 
05Dt 9:11 Yes, after those forty days and nights the LORD gave me the two stone tablets on which he had written the covenant. 
05Dt 9:12 "Then the LORD said to me, 'Go down the mountain at once, because your people, whom you led out of Egypt, have become corrupt and have done evil. They have already turned away from what I commanded them to do, and they have made an idol for themselves.' 
05Dt 9:13 "The LORD also said to me, 'I know how stubborn these people are. 
05Dt 9:14 Don't try to stop me. I intend to destroy them so that no one will remember them any longer. Then I will make you the father of a nation larger and more powerful than they are.' 
05Dt 9:15 "So I turned and went down the mountain, carrying the two stone tablets on which the covenant was written. Flames of fire were coming from the mountain. 
05Dt 9:16 I saw that you had already disobeyed the command that the LORD your God had given you, and that you had sinned against him by making yourselves a metal idol in the form of a bull-calf. 
05Dt 9:17 So there in front of you I threw the stone tablets down and broke them to pieces. 
05Dt 9:18 Then once again I lay face downward in the LORD's presence for forty days and nights and did not eat or drink anything. I did this because you had sinned against the LORD and had made him angry. 
05Dt 9:19 I was afraid of the LORD's fierce anger, because he was furious enough to destroy you; but once again the LORD listened to me. 
05Dt 9:20 The LORD was also angry enough with Aaron to kill him, so I prayed for Aaron at the same time. 
05Dt 9:21 I took that sinful thing that you had made - that metal bull-calf - and threw it into the fire. Then I broke it in pieces, ground it to dust, and threw the dust into the stream that flowed down the mountain. 
05Dt 9:22 "You also made the LORD your God angry when you were at Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth Hattaavah. 
05Dt 9:23 And when he sent you from Kadesh Barnea with orders to go and take possession of the land that he was giving you, you rebelled against him; you did not trust him or obey him. 
05Dt 9:24 Ever since I have known you, you have rebelled against the LORD. 
05Dt 9:25 "So I lay face downward in the LORD's presence those forty days and nights, because I knew that he was determined to destroy you. 
05Dt 9:26 And I prayed, 'Sovereign LORD, don't destroy your own people, the people you rescued and brought out of Egypt by your great strength and power. 
05Dt 9:27 Remember your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and do not pay any attention to the stubbornness, wickedness, and sin of this people. 
05Dt 9:28 Otherwise, the Egyptians will say that you were unable to take your people into the land that you had promised them. They will say that you took your people out into the desert to kill them, because you hated them. 
05Dt 9:29 After all, these are the people whom you chose to be your own and whom you brought out of Egypt by your great power and might.' 
05Dt 10:1 "Then the LORD said to me, 'Cut two stone tablets like the first ones and make a wooden Box to put them in. Come up to me on the mountain, 
05Dt 10:2 and I will write on those tablets what I wrote on the tablets that you broke, and then you are to put them in the Box.' 
05Dt 10:3 "So I made a Box of acacia wood and cut two stone tablets like the first ones and took them up the mountain. 
05Dt 10:4 Then the LORD wrote on those tablets the same words that he had written the first time, the Ten Commandments that he gave you when he spoke from the fire on the day you were gathered at the mountain. The LORD gave me the tablets, 
05Dt 10:5 and I turned and went down the mountain. Then, just as the LORD had commanded, I put them in the Box that I had made - and they have been there ever since." 
05Dt 10:6 (The Israelites set out from the wells that belonged to the people of Jaakan, and went to Moserah. There Aaron died and was buried, and his son Eleazar succeeded him as priest. 
05Dt 10:7 From there they went to Gudgodah and then on to Jotbathah, a well-watered place. 
05Dt 10:8 At the mountain the LORD appointed the men of the tribe of Levi to be in charge of the Covenant Box, to serve him as priests, and to pronounce blessings in his name. And these are still their duties. 
05Dt 10:9 That is why the tribe of Levi received no land as the other tribes did; what they received was the privilege of being the LORD's priests, as the LORD your God promised.) 
05Dt 10:10 "I stayed on the mountain forty days and nights, as I did the first time. The LORD listened to me once more and agreed not to destroy you. 
05Dt 10:11 Then he told me to go and lead you, so that you could take possession of the land that he had promised to give to your ancestors. 
05Dt 10:12 "Now, people of Israel, listen to what the LORD your God demands of you: Worship the LORD and do all that he commands. Love him, serve him with all your heart, 
05Dt 10:13 and obey all his laws. I am giving them to you today for your benefit. 
05Dt 10:14 To the LORD belong even the highest heavens; the earth is his also, and everything on it. 
05Dt 10:15 But the LORD's love for your ancestors was so strong that he chose you instead of any other people, and you are still his chosen people. 
05Dt 10:16 So then, from now on be obedient to the LORD and stop being stubborn. 
05Dt 10:17 The LORD your God is supreme over all gods and over all powers. He is great and mighty, and he is to be obeyed. He does not show partiality, and he does not accept bribes. 
05Dt 10:18 He makes sure that orphans and widows are treated fairly; he loves the foreigners who live with our people, and gives them food and clothes. 
05Dt 10:19 So then, show love for those foreigners, because you were once foreigners in Egypt. 
05Dt 10:20 Have reverence for the LORD your God and worship only him. Be faithful to him and make your promises in his name alone. 
05Dt 10:21 Praise him - he is your God, and you have seen with your own eyes the great and astounding things that he has done for you. 
05Dt 10:22 When your ancestors went to Egypt, there were only seventy of them. But now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky. 
05Dt 11:1 "Love the LORD your God and always obey all his laws. 
05Dt 11:2 Remember today what you have learned about the LORD through your experiences with him. It was you, not your children, who had these experiences. You saw the LORD's greatness, his power, his might, 
05Dt 11:3 and his miracles. You saw what he did to the king of Egypt and to his entire country. 
05Dt 11:4 You saw how the LORD completely wiped out the Egyptian army, along with their horses and chariots, by drowning them in the Red Sea when they were pursuing you. 
05Dt 11:5 You know what the LORD did for you in the desert before you arrived here. 
05Dt 11:6 You recall what he did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab of the tribe of Reuben. In the sight of everyone the earth opened up and swallowed them, along with their families, their tents, and all their servants and animals. 
05Dt 11:7 Yes, you are the ones who have seen all these great things that the LORD has done. 
05Dt 11:8 "Obey everything that I have commanded you today. Then you will be able to cross the river and occupy the land that you are about to enter. 
05Dt 11:9 And you will live a long time in the rich and fertile land that the LORD promised to give your ancestors and their descendants. 
05Dt 11:10 The land that you are about to occupy is not like the land of Egypt, where you lived before. There, when you planted grain, you had to work hard to irrigate the fields; 
05Dt 11:11 but the land that you are about to enter is a land of mountains and valleys, a land watered by rain. 
05Dt 11:12 The LORD your God takes care of this land and watches over it throughout the year. 
05Dt 11:13 "So then, obey the commands that I have given you today; love the LORD your God and serve him with all your heart. 
05Dt 11:14 If you do, he will send rain on your land when it is needed, in the autumn and in the spring, so that there will be grain, wine, and olive oil for you, 
05Dt 11:15 and grass for your livestock. You will have all the food you want. 
05Dt 11:16 Do not let yourselves be led away from the LORD to worship and serve other gods. 
05Dt 11:17 If you do, the LORD will become angry with you. He will hold back the rain, and your ground will become too dry for crops to grow. Then you will soon die there, even though it is a good land that he is giving you. 
05Dt 11:18 "Remember these commands and cherish them. Tie them on your arms and wear them on your foreheads as a reminder. 
05Dt 11:19 Teach them to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and when you are away, when you are resting and when you are working. 
05Dt 11:20 Write them on the doorposts of your houses and on your gates. 
05Dt 11:21 Then you and your children will live a long time in the land that the LORD your God promised to give to your ancestors. You will live there as long as there is a sky above the earth. 
05Dt 11:22 "Obey faithfully everything that I have commanded you: Love the LORD your God, do everything he commands, and be faithful to him. 
05Dt 11:23 Then he will drive out all those nations as you advance, and you will occupy the land belonging to nations greater and more powerful than you. 
05Dt 11:24 All the ground that you march over will be yours. Your territory will extend from the desert in the south to the Lebanon Mountains in the north, and from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 
05Dt 11:25 Wherever you go in that land, the LORD your God will make the people fear you, as he has promised, and no one will be able to stop you. 
05Dt 11:26 "Today I am giving you the choice between a blessing and a curse - 
05Dt 11:27 a blessing, if you obey the commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you today; 
05Dt 11:28 but a curse, if you disobey these commands and turn away to worship other gods that you have never worshiped before. 
05Dt 11:29 When the LORD brings you into the land that you are going to occupy, you are to proclaim the blessing from Mount Gerizim and the curse from Mount Ebal. 
05Dt 11:30 (These two mountains are west of the Jordan River in the territory of the Canaanites who live in the Jordan Valley. They are toward the west, not far from the sacred trees of Moreh near the town of Gilgal.) 
05Dt 11:31 You are about to cross the Jordan River and occupy the land that the LORD your God is giving you. When you take it and settle there, 
05Dt 11:32 be sure to obey all the laws that I am giving you today. 
05Dt 12:1 "Here are the laws that you are to obey as long as you live in the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, is giving you. Listen to them! 
05Dt 12:2 In the land that you are taking, destroy all the places where the people worship their gods on high mountains, on hills, and under green trees. 
05Dt 12:3 Tear down their altars and smash their sacred stone pillars to pieces. Burn their symbols of the goddess Asherah and chop down their idols, so that they will never again be worshiped at those places. 
05Dt 12:4 "Do not worship the LORD your God in the way that these people worship their gods. 
05Dt 12:5 Out of the territory of all your tribes the LORD will choose the one place where the people are to come into his presence and worship him. 
05Dt 12:6 There you are to offer your sacrifices that are to be burned and your other sacrifices, your tithes and your offerings, the gifts that you promise to the LORD, your freewill offerings, and the first-born of your cattle and sheep. 
05Dt 12:7 There, in the presence of the LORD your God, who has blessed you, you and your families will eat and enjoy the good things that you have worked for. 
05Dt 12:8 "When that time comes, you must not do as you have been doing. Until now you have all been worshiping as you please, 
05Dt 12:9 because you have not yet entered the land that the LORD your God is giving you, where you can live in peace. 
05Dt 12:10 When you cross the Jordan River, the LORD will let you occupy the land and live there. He will keep you safe from all your enemies, and you will live in peace. 
05Dt 12:11 The LORD will choose a single place where he is to be worshiped, and there you must bring to him everything that I have commanded: your sacrifices that are to be burned and your other sacrifices, your tithes and your offerings, and those special gifts that you have promised to the LORD. 
05Dt 12:12 Be joyful there in his presence, together with your children, your servants, and the Levites who live in your towns; remember that the Levites will have no land of their own. 
05Dt 12:13 You are not to offer your sacrifices wherever you choose; 
05Dt 12:14 you must offer them only in the one place that the LORD will choose in the territory of one of your tribes. Only there are you to offer your sacrifices that are to be burned and do all the other things that I have commanded you. 
05Dt 12:15 "But you are free to kill and eat your animals wherever you live. You may eat as many as the LORD gives you. All of you, whether ritually clean or unclean, may eat them, just as you would eat the meat of deer or antelope. 
05Dt 12:16 But you must not eat their blood; you must pour it out on the ground like water. 
05Dt 12:17 Nothing that you offer to the LORD is to be eaten in the places where you live: neither the tithes of your grain, your wine, or your olive oil, nor the first-born of your cattle and sheep, the gifts that you promise to the LORD, your freewill offerings, or any other offerings. 
05Dt 12:18 You and your children, together with your servants and the Levites who live in your towns, are to eat these offerings only in the presence of the LORD your God, in the one place of worship chosen by the LORD your God. And you are to be happy there over everything that you have done. 
05Dt 12:19 Be sure, also, not to neglect the Levites, as long as you live in your land. 
05Dt 12:20 "When the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he has promised, you may eat meat whenever you want to. 
05Dt 12:21 If the one place of worship is too far away, then, whenever you wish, you may kill any of the cattle or sheep that the LORD has given you, and you may eat the meat at home, as I have told you. 
05Dt 12:22 Anyone, ritually clean or unclean, may eat that meat, just as he would eat the meat of deer or antelope. 
05Dt 12:23 Only do not eat meat with blood still in it, for the life is in the blood, and you must not eat the life with the meat. 
05Dt 12:24 Do not use the blood for food; instead, pour it out on the ground like water. 
05Dt 12:25 If you obey this command, the LORD will be pleased, and all will go well for you and your descendants. 
05Dt 12:26 Take to the one place of worship your offerings and the gifts that you have promised the LORD. 
05Dt 12:27 Offer there the sacrifices which are to be completely burned on the LORD's altar. Also offer those sacrifices in which you eat the meat and pour the blood out on the altar. 
05Dt 12:28 Obey faithfully everything that I have commanded you, and all will go well for you and your descendants forever, because you will be doing what is right and what pleases the LORD your God. 
05Dt 12:29 "The LORD your God will destroy the nations as you invade their land, and you will occupy it and settle there. 
05Dt 12:30 After the LORD destroys those nations, make sure that you don't follow their religious practices, because that would be fatal. Don't try to find out how they worship their gods, so that you can worship in the same way. 
05Dt 12:31 Do not worship the LORD your God in the way they worship their gods, for in the worship of their gods they do all the disgusting things that the LORD hates. They even sacrifice their children in the fires on their altars. 
05Dt 12:32 "Do everything that I have commanded you; do not add anything to it or take anything from it. 
05Dt 13:1 "Prophets or interpreters of dreams may promise a miracle or a wonder, 
05Dt 13:2 in order to lead you to worship and serve gods that you have not worshiped before. Even if what they promise comes true, 
05Dt 13:3 do not pay any attention to them. The LORD your God is using them to test you, to see if you love the LORD with all your heart. 
05Dt 13:4 Follow the LORD and honor him; obey him and keep his commands; worship him and be faithful to him. 
05Dt 13:5 But put to death any interpreters of dreams or prophets that tell you to rebel against the LORD, who rescued you from Egypt, where you were slaves. Such people are evil and are trying to lead you away from the life that the LORD has commanded you to live. They must be put to death, in order to rid yourselves of this evil. 
05Dt 13:6 "Even your brother or your son or your daughter or the wife you love or your closest friend may secretly encourage you to worship other gods, gods that you and your ancestors have never worshiped. 
05Dt 13:7 Some of them may encourage you to worship the gods of the people who live near you or the gods of those who live far away. 
05Dt 13:8 But do not let any of them persuade you; do not even listen to them. Show them no mercy or pity, and do not protect them. 
05Dt 13:9 Kill them! Be the first to stone them, and then let everyone else stone them too. 
05Dt 13:10 Stone them to death! They tried to lead you away from the LORD your God, who rescued you from Egypt, where you were slaves. 
05Dt 13:11 Then all the people of Israel will hear what happened; they will be afraid, and no one will ever again do such an evil thing. 
05Dt 13:12 "When you are living in the towns that the LORD your God gives you, you may hear 
05Dt 13:13 that some worthless people of your nation have misled the people of their town to worship gods that you have never worshiped before. 
05Dt 13:14 If you hear such a rumor, investigate it thoroughly; and if it is true that this evil thing did happen, 
05Dt 13:15 then kill all the people in that town and all their livestock too. Destroy that town completely. 
05Dt 13:16 Bring together all the possessions of the people who live there and pile them up in the town square. Then burn the town and everything in it as an offering to the LORD your God. It must be left in ruins forever and never again be rebuilt. 
05Dt 13:17 Do not keep for yourselves anything that was condemned to destruction, and then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and show you mercy. He will be merciful to you and make you a numerous people, as he promised your ancestors, 
05Dt 13:18 if you obey all his commands that I have given you today, and do what he requires. 
05Dt 14:1 "You are the people of the LORD your God. So when you mourn for the dead, don't gash yourselves or shave the front of your head, as other people do. 
05Dt 14:2 You belong to the LORD your God; he has chosen you to be his own people from among all the peoples who live on earth. 
05Dt 14:3 "Do not eat anything that the LORD has declared unclean. 
05Dt 14:4 You may eat these animals: cattle, sheep, goats, 
05Dt 14:5 deer, wild sheep, wild goats, or antelopes - 
05Dt 14:6 any animals that have divided hoofs and that also chew the cud. 
05Dt 14:7 But no animals may be eaten unless they have divided hoofs and also chew the cud. You may not eat camels, rabbits, or rock badgers. They must be considered unclean; they chew the cud but do not have divided hoofs. 
05Dt 14:8 Do not eat pigs. They must be considered unclean; they have divided hoofs but do not chew the cud. Do not eat any of these animals or even touch their dead bodies. 
05Dt 14:9 "You may eat any kind of fish that has fins and scales, 
05Dt 14:10 but anything living in the water that does not have fins and scales may not be eaten; it must be considered unclean. 
05Dt 14:11 "You may eat any clean bird. 
05Dt 14:12 But these are the kinds of birds you are not to eat:
05Dt 14:13 eagles, owls, hawks, falcons;
05Dt 14:14 buzzards, vultures, crows; 
05Dt 14:15 ostriches; 
05Dt 14:16 seagulls, storks, herons, pelicans, cormorants;
05Dt 14:17 hoopoes;
05Dt 14:18 and bats. 
05Dt 14:19 "All winged insects are unclean; do not eat them. 
05Dt 14:20 You may eat any clean insect. 
05Dt 14:21 "Do not eat any animal that dies a natural death. You may let the foreigners who live among you eat it, or you may sell it to other foreigners. But you belong to the LORD your God; you are his people. "Do not cook a young sheep or goat in its mother's milk. 
05Dt 14:22 "Set aside a tithe - a tenth of all that your fields produce each year. 
05Dt 14:23 Then go to the one place where the LORD your God has chosen to be worshiped; and there in his presence eat the tithes of your grain, wine, and olive oil, and the first-born of your cattle and sheep. Do this so that you may learn to honor the LORD your God always. 
05Dt 14:24 If the place of worship is too far from your home for you to carry there the tithe of the produce that the LORD has blessed you with, then do this�� 05Dt 14:25 Sell your produce and take the money with you to the one place of worship. 
05Dt 14:26 Spend it on whatever you want - beef, lamb, wine, beer - and there, in the presence of the LORD your God, you and your families are to eat and enjoy yourselves. 
05Dt 14:27 "Do not neglect the Levites who live in your towns; they have no property of their own. 
05Dt 14:28 At the end of every third year bring the tithe of all your crops and store it in your towns. 
05Dt 14:29 This food is for the Levites, since they own no property, and for the foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your towns. They are to come and get all they need. Do this, and the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do. 
05Dt 15:1 "At the end of every seventh year you are to cancel the debts of those who owe you money. 
05Dt 15:2 This is how it is to be done. Each of you who has lent money to any Israelite is to cancel the debt; you must not try to collect the money; the LORD himself has declared the debt canceled. 
05Dt 15:3 You may collect what a foreigner owes you, but you must not collect what any of your own people owe you. 
05Dt 15:4 "The LORD your God will bless you in the land that he is giving you. Not one of your people will be poor 
05Dt 15:5 if you obey him and carefully observe everything that I command you today. 
05Dt 15:6 The LORD will bless you, as he has promised. You will lend money to many nations, but you will not have to borrow from any; you will have control over many nations, but no nation will have control over you. 
05Dt 15:7 "If in any of the towns in the land that the LORD your God is giving you there are Israelites in need, then do not be selfish and refuse to help them. 
05Dt 15:8 Instead, be generous and lend them as much as they need. 
05Dt 15:9 Do not refuse to lend them something, just because the year when debts are canceled is near. Do not let such an evil thought enter your mind. If you refuse to make the loan, they will cry out to the LORD against you, and you will be held guilty. 
05Dt 15:10 Give to them freely and unselfishly, and the LORD will bless you in everything you do. 
05Dt 15:11 There will always be some Israelites who are poor and in need, and so I command you to be generous to them. 
05Dt 15:12 "If any Israelites, male or female, sell themselves to you as slaves, you are to release them after they have served you for six years. When the seventh year comes, you must let them go free. 
05Dt 15:13 When you set them free, do not send them away empty-handed. 
05Dt 15:14 Give to them generously from what the LORD has blessed you with - sheep, grain, and wine. 
05Dt 15:15 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and the LORD your God set you free; that is why I am now giving you this command. 
05Dt 15:16 "But your slave may not want to leave; he may love you and your family and be content to stay. 
05Dt 15:17 Then take him to the door of your house and there pierce his ear; he will then be your slave for life. Treat your female slave in the same way. 
05Dt 15:18 Do not be resentful when you set slaves free; after all, they have served you for six years at half the cost of hired servants. Do this, and the LORD your God will bless you in all that you do. 
05Dt 15:19 "Set aside for the LORD your God all the first-born males of your cattle and sheep; don't use any of these cattle for work and don't shear any of these sheep. 
05Dt 15:20 Each year you and your family are to eat them in the LORD's presence at the one place of worship. 
05Dt 15:21 But if there is anything wrong with the animals, if they are crippled or blind or have any other serious defect, you must not sacrifice them to the LORD your God. 
05Dt 15:22 You may eat such animals at home. All of you, whether ritually clean or unclean, may eat them, just as you eat deer or antelope. 
05Dt 15:23 But do not use their blood for food; instead, you must pour it out on the ground like water. 
05Dt 16:1 "Honor the LORD your God by celebrating Passover in the month of Abib; it was on a night in that month that he rescued you from Egypt. 
05Dt 16:2 Go to the one place of worship and slaughter there one of your sheep or cattle for the Passover meal to honor the LORD your God. 
05Dt 16:3 When you eat this meal, do not eat bread prepared with yeast. For seven days you are to eat bread prepared without yeast, as you did when you had to leave Egypt in such a hurry. Eat this bread - it will be called the bread of suffering - so that as long as you live you will remember the day you came out of Egypt, that place of suffering. 
05Dt 16:4 For seven days no one in your land is to have any yeast in the house; and the meat of the animal killed on the evening of the first day must be eaten that same night. 
05Dt 16:5 "Slaughter the Passover animals at the one place of worship - and nowhere else in the land that the LORD your God will give you. 
05Dt 16:6 Do it at sunset, the time of day when you left Egypt. 
05Dt 16:7 Boil the meat and eat it at the one place of worship; and the next morning return home. 
05Dt 16:8 For the next six days you are to eat bread prepared without yeast, and on the seventh day assemble to worship the LORD your God, and do no work on that day. 
05Dt 16:9 "Count seven weeks from the time that you begin to harvest the grain, 
05Dt 16:10 and then celebrate the Harvest Festival, to honor the LORD your God, by bringing him a freewill offering in proportion to the blessing he has given you. 
05Dt 16:11 Be joyful in the LORD's presence, together with your children, your servants, and the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your towns. Do this at the one place of worship. 
05Dt 16:12 Be sure that you obey these commands; do not forget that you were slaves in Egypt. 
05Dt 16:13 "After you have threshed all your grain and pressed all your grapes, celebrate the Festival of Shelters for seven days. 
05Dt 16:14 Enjoy it with your children, your servants, and the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your towns. 
05Dt 16:15 Honor the LORD your God by celebrating this festival for seven days at the one place of worship. Be joyful, because the LORD has blessed your harvest and your work. 
05Dt 16:16 "All the men of your nation are to come to worship the LORD three times a year at the one place of worship: at Passover, Harvest Festival, and the Festival of Shelters. Each man is to bring a gift 
05Dt 16:17 as he is able, in proportion to the blessings that the LORD your God has given him. 
05Dt 16:18 "Appoint judges and other officials in every town that the LORD your God gives you. These men are to judge the people impartially. 
05Dt 16:19 They are not to be unjust or show partiality in their judgments; and they are not to accept bribes, for gifts blind the eyes even of wise and honest men, and cause them to give wrong decisions. 
05Dt 16:20 Always be fair and just, so that you will occupy the land that the LORD your God is giving you and so that you will continue to live there. 
05Dt 16:21 "When you make an altar for the LORD your God, do not put beside it a wooden symbol of the goddess Asherah. 
05Dt 16:22 And do not set up any stone pillar for idol worship; the LORD hates them. 
05Dt 17:1 "Do not sacrifice to the LORD your God cattle or sheep that have any defects; the LORD hates this. 
05Dt 17:2 "Suppose you hear that in one of your towns some men or women have sinned against the LORD and broken his covenant 
05Dt 17:3 by worshiping and serving other gods or the sun or the moon or the stars, contrary to the LORD's command. 
05Dt 17:4 If you hear such a report, then investigate it thoroughly. If it is true that this evil thing has happened in Israel, 
05Dt 17:5 then take them outside the town and stone them to death. 
05Dt 17:6 However, they may be put to death only if two or more witnesses testify against them; they are not to be put to death if there is only one witness. 
05Dt 17:7 The witnesses are to throw the first stones, and then the rest of the people are to stone them; in this way you will get rid of this evil. 
05Dt 17:8 "It may be that some cases will be too difficult for the local judges to decide, such as certain cases of property rights or of bodily injury or those cases that involve a distinction between murder and manslaughter. When this happens, go to the one place of worship chosen by the LORD your God, 
05Dt 17:9 and present your case to the levitical priests and to the judge who is in office at that time, and let them decide the case. 
05Dt 17:10 They will give their decision, and you are to do exactly as they tell you. 
05Dt 17:11 Accept their verdict and follow their instructions in every detail. 
05Dt 17:12 Anyone who dares to disobey either the judge or the priest on duty is to be put to death; in this way you will remove this evil from Israel. 
05Dt 17:13 Then everyone will hear of it and be afraid, and no one else will dare to act in such a way. 
05Dt 17:14 "After you have taken possession of the land that the LORD your God is going to give you and have settled there, then you will decide you need a king like all the nations around you. 
05Dt 17:15 Be sure that the man you choose to be king is the one whom the LORD has chosen. He must be one of your own people; do not make a foreigner your king. 
05Dt 17:16 The king is not to have a large number of horses for his army, and he is not to send people to Egypt to buy horses, because the LORD has said that his people are never to return there. 
05Dt 17:17 The king is not to have many wives, because this would make him turn away from the LORD; and he is not to make himself rich with silver and gold. 
05Dt 17:18 When he becomes king, he is to have a copy of the book of God's laws and teachings made from the original copy kept by the levitical priests. 
05Dt 17:19 He is to keep this book near him and read from it all his life, so that he will learn to honor the LORD and to obey faithfully everything that is commanded in it. 
05Dt 17:20 This will keep him from thinking that he is better than other Israelites and from disobeying the LORD's commands in any way. Then he will reign for many years, and his descendants will rule Israel for many generations. 
05Dt 18:1 "The priestly tribe of Levi is not to receive any share of land in Israel; instead, they are to live on the offerings and other sacrifices given to the LORD. 
05Dt 18:2 They are to own no land, as the other tribes do; their share is the privilege of being the LORD's priests, as the LORD has promised. 
05Dt 18:3 "Whenever cattle or sheep are sacrificed, the priests are to be given the shoulder, the jaw, and the stomach. 
05Dt 18:4 They are to receive the first share of the grain, wine, olive oil, and wool. 
05Dt 18:5 The LORD chose from all your tribes the tribe of Levi to serve him as priests forever. 
05Dt 18:6 "Any Levite who wants to may come from any town in Israel to the one place of worship 
05Dt 18:7 and may serve there as a priest of the LORD his God, like the other Levites who are serving there. 
05Dt 18:8 He is to receive the same amount of food as the other priests, and he may keep whatever his family sends him. 
05Dt 18:9 "When you come into the land that the LORD your God is giving you, don't follow the disgusting practices of the nations that are there. 
05Dt 18:10 Don't sacrifice your children in the fires on your altars; and don't let your people practice divination or look for omens or use spells 
05Dt 18:11 or charms, and don't let them consult the spirits of the dead. 
05Dt 18:12 The LORD your God hates people who do these disgusting things, and that is why he is driving those nations out of the land as you advance. 
05Dt 18:13 Be completely faithful to the LORD." 
05Dt 18:14 Then Moses said, "In the land you are about to occupy, people follow the advice of those who practice divination and look for omens, but the LORD your God does not allow you to do this. 
05Dt 18:15 Instead, he will send you a prophet like me from among your own people, and you are to obey him. 
05Dt 18:16 "On the day that you were gathered at Mount Sinai, you begged not to hear the LORD speak again or to see his fiery presence any more, because you were afraid you would die. 
05Dt 18:17 So the LORD said to me, 'They have made a wise request. 
05Dt 18:18 I will send them a prophet like you from among their own people; I will tell him what to say, and he will tell the people everything I command. 
05Dt 18:19 He will speak in my name, and I will punish anyone who refuses to obey him. 
05Dt 18:20 But if any prophet dares to speak a message in my name when I did not command him to do so, he must die for it, and so must any prophet who speaks in the name of other gods.' 
05Dt 18:21 "You may wonder how you can tell when a prophet's message does not come from the LORD. 
05Dt 18:22 If a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD and what he says does not come true, then it is not the LORD's message. That prophet has spoken on his own authority, and you are not to fear him. 
05Dt 19:1 "After the LORD your God has destroyed the people whose land he is giving you and after you have taken their cities and houses and settled there, 
05Dt 19:2 divide the territory into three parts, each with a city that can be easily reached.
05Dt 19:3 Then any of you that kill will be able to escape to one of them for protection. 
05Dt 19:4 If you accidentally kill someone who is not your enemy, you may escape to any of these cities and be safe. 
05Dt 19:5 For example, if two of you go into the forest together to cut wood and if, as one of you is chopping down a tree, the ax head comes off the handle and kills the other, you can run to one of those three cities and be safe. 
05Dt 19:6 If there were only one city, the distance to it might be too great, and the relative who is responsible for taking revenge for the killing might catch you and angrily kill an innocent person. After all, it was by accident that you killed someone who was not your enemy. 
05Dt 19:7 This is why I order you to set aside three cities. 
05Dt 19:8 "When the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he told your ancestors he would, and gives you all the land he has promised, 
05Dt 19:9 then you are to select three more cities. (He will give you this land if you do everything that I command you today and if you love the LORD your God and live according to his teachings.) 
05Dt 19:10 Do this, so that innocent people will not die and so that you will not be guilty of putting them to death in the land that the LORD is giving you. 
05Dt 19:11 "But suppose you deliberately murder your enemy in cold blood and then escape to one of those cities for protection. 
05Dt 19:12 In that case, the leaders of your own town are to send for you and hand you over to the relative responsible for taking revenge for the murder, so that you may be put to death. 
05Dt 19:13 No mercy will be shown to you. Israel must rid itself of murderers, so that all will go well. 
05Dt 19:14 "Do not move your neighbor's property line, established long ago in the land that the LORD your God is giving you. 
05Dt 19:15 "One witness is not enough to convict someone of a crime; at least two witnesses are necessary to prove that someone is guilty. 
05Dt 19:16 If any of you try to harm another by false accusations, 
05Dt 19:17 both of you are to go to the one place of worship and be judged by the priests and judges who are then in office. 
05Dt 19:18 The judges will investigate the case thoroughly; and if you have made a false accusation, 
05Dt 19:19 you are to receive the punishment the accused would have received. In this way your nation will get rid of this evil. 
05Dt 19:20 Then everyone else will hear what happened; they will be afraid, and no one will ever again do such an evil thing. 
05Dt 19:21 In such cases show no mercy; the punishment is to be a life for a life, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a hand for a hand, and a foot for a foot. 
05Dt 20:1 "When you go out to fight against your enemies and you see chariots and horses and an army that outnumbers yours, do not be afraid of them. The LORD your God, who rescued you from Egypt, will be with you. 
05Dt 20:2 Before you start fighting, a priest is to come forward and say to the army, 
05Dt 20:3 'Men of Israel, listen! Today you are going into battle. Do not be afraid of your enemies or lose courage or panic. 
05Dt 20:4 The LORD your God is going with you, and he will give you victory.' 
05Dt 20:5 "Then the officers will address the men and say, 'Is there any man here who has just built a house, but has not yet dedicated it? If so, he is to go home. Otherwise, if he is killed in battle, someone else will dedicate his house. 
05Dt 20:6 Is there any man here who has just planted a vineyard, but has not yet had the chance to harvest its grapes? If so, he is to go home. Otherwise, if he is killed in battle, someone else will enjoy the wine. 
05Dt 20:7 Is there anyone here who is engaged to be married? If so, he is to go home. Otherwise, if he is killed in battle, someone else will marry the woman he is engaged to.' 
05Dt 20:8 "The officers will also say to the men, 'Is there any man here who has lost his nerve and is afraid? If so, he is to go home. Otherwise, he will destroy the morale of the others.' 
05Dt 20:9 When the officers have finished speaking to the army, leaders are to be chosen for each unit. 
05Dt 20:10 "When you go to attack a city, first give its people a chance to surrender. 
05Dt 20:11 If they open the gates and surrender, they are all to become your slaves and do forced labor for you. 
05Dt 20:12 But if the people of that city will not surrender, but choose to fight, surround it with your army. 
05Dt 20:13 Then, when the LORD your God lets you capture the city, kill every man in it. 
05Dt 20:14 You may, however, take for yourselves the women, the children, the livestock, and everything else in the city. You may use everything that belongs to your enemies. The LORD has given it to you. 
05Dt 20:15 That is how you are to deal with those cities that are far away from the land you will settle in. 
05Dt 20:16 "But when you capture cities in the land that the LORD your God is giving you, kill everyone. 
05Dt 20:17 Completely destroy all the people: the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, as the LORD ordered you to do. 
05Dt 20:18 Kill them, so that they will not make you sin against the LORD by teaching you to do all the disgusting things that they do in the worship of their gods. 
05Dt 20:19 "When you are trying to capture a city, do not cut down its fruit trees, even though the siege lasts a long time. Eat the fruit, but do not destroy the trees; the trees are not your enemies. 
05Dt 20:20 You may cut down the other trees and use them in the siege mounds until the city is captured. 
05Dt 21:1 "Suppose someone is found murdered in a field in the land that the LORD your God is going to give you, and you do not know who killed him. 
05Dt 21:2 Your leaders and judges are to go out and measure the distance from the place where the body was found to each of the nearby towns. 
05Dt 21:3 Then the leaders of the town nearest to where the body was found are to select a young cow that has never been used for work. 
05Dt 21:4 They are to take it down to a spot near a stream that never runs dry and where the ground has never been plowed or planted, and there they are to break its neck. 
05Dt 21:5 The levitical priests are to go there also, because they are to decide every legal case involving violence. The LORD your God has chosen them to serve him and to pronounce blessings in his name. 
05Dt 21:6 Then all the leaders from the town nearest the place where the murdered person was found are to wash their hands over the cow 
05Dt 21:7 and say, 'We did not murder this one, and we do not know who did it. 
05Dt 21:8 LORD, forgive your people Israel, whom you rescued from Egypt. Forgive us and do not hold us responsible for the murder of an innocent person.' 
05Dt 21:9 And so, by doing what the LORD requires, you will not be held responsible for the murder. 
05Dt 21:10 "When the LORD your God gives you victory in battle and you take prisoners, 
05Dt 21:11 you may see among them a beautiful woman that you like and want to marry. 
05Dt 21:12 Take her to your home, where she will shave her head, cut her fingernails, 
05Dt 21:13 and change her clothes. She is to stay in your home and mourn for her parents for a month; after that, you may marry her. 
05Dt 21:14 Later, if you no longer want her, you are to let her go free. Since you forced her to have intercourse with you, you cannot treat her as a slave and sell her. 
05Dt 21:15 "Suppose a man has two wives and they both bear him sons, but the first son is not the child of his favorite wife. 
05Dt 21:16 When the man decides how he is going to divide his property among his children, he is not to show partiality to the son of his favorite wife by giving him the share that belongs to the first-born son. 
05Dt 21:17 He is to give a double share of his possessions to his first son, even though he is not the son of his favorite wife. A man must acknowledge his first son and give him the share he is legally entitled to. 
05Dt 21:18 "Suppose someone has a son who is stubborn and rebellious, a son who will not obey his parents, even though they punish him. 
05Dt 21:19 His parents are to take him before the leaders of the town where he lives and make him stand trial. 
05Dt 21:20 They are to say to them, 'Our son is stubborn and rebellious and refuses to obey us; he wastes money and is a drunkard.' 
05Dt 21:21 Then the men of the city are to stone him to death, and so you will get rid of this evil. Everyone in Israel will hear what has happened and be afraid. 
05Dt 21:22 "If someone has been put to death for a crime and the body is hung on a post, 
05Dt 21:23 it is not to remain there overnight. It must be buried the same day, because a dead body hanging on a post brings God's curse on the land. Bury the body, so that you will not defile the land that the LORD your God is giving you. 
05Dt 22:1 "If you see an Israelite's cow or sheep running loose, do not ignore it; take it back. 
05Dt 22:2 But if its owner lives a long way off or if you don't know who owns it, then take it home with you. When its owner comes looking for it, give it to him. 
05Dt 22:3 Do the same thing if you find a donkey, a piece of clothing, or anything else that an Israelite may have lost. 
05Dt 22:4 "If an Israelite's donkey or cow has fallen down, don't ignore it; help him get the animal to its feet again. 
05Dt 22:5 "Women are not to wear men's clothing, and men are not to wear women's clothing; the LORD your God hates people who do such things. 
05Dt 22:6 "If you happen to find a bird's nest in a tree or on the ground with the mother bird sitting either on the eggs or with her young, you are not to take the mother bird. 
05Dt 22:7 You may take the young birds, but you must let the mother bird go, so that you will live a long and prosperous life. 
05Dt 22:8 "When you build a new house, be sure to put a railing around the edge of the roof. Then you will not be responsible if someone falls off and is killed. 
05Dt 22:9 "Do not plant any crop in the same field with your grapevines; if you do, you are forbidden to use either the grapes or the produce of the other crop.

05Dt 22:11 "Do not wear cloth made by weaving wool and linen together. 
05Dt 22:12 "Sew tassels on the four corners of your clothes. 
05Dt 22:13 "Suppose a man marries a young woman and later he decides he doesn't want her. 
05Dt 22:14 So he makes up false charges against her, accusing her of not being a virgin when they got married. 
05Dt 22:15 "If this happens, the young woman's parents are to take the blood-stained wedding sheet that proves she was a virgin, and they are to show it in court to the town leaders. 
05Dt 22:16 Her father will say to them, 'I gave my daughter to this man in marriage, and now he doesn't want her. 
05Dt 22:17 He has made false charges against her, saying that she was not a virgin when he married her. But here is the proof that my daughter was a virgin; look at the bloodstains on the wedding sheet!' 
05Dt 22:18 Then the town leaders are to take the husband and beat him. 
05Dt 22:19 They are also to fine him a hundred pieces of silver and give the money to the young woman's father, because the man has brought disgrace on an Israelite woman. Moreover, she will continue to be his wife, and he can never divorce her as long as he lives. 
05Dt 22:20 "But if the charge is true and there is no proof that she was a virgin, 
05Dt 22:21 then they are to take her out to the entrance of her father's house, where the men of her city are to stone her to death. She has done a shameful thing among our people by having intercourse before she was married, while she was still living in her father's house. In this way you will get rid of this evil. 
05Dt 22:22 "If a man is caught having intercourse with another man's wife, both of them are to be put to death. In this way you will get rid of this evil. 
05Dt 22:23 "Suppose a man is caught in a town having intercourse with a young woman who is engaged to someone else. 
05Dt 22:24 You are to take them outside the town and stone them to death. She is to die because she did not cry out for help, although she was in a town, where she could have been heard. And the man is to die because he had intercourse with someone who was engaged. In this way you will get rid of this evil. 
05Dt 22:25 "Suppose a man out in the countryside rapes a young woman who is engaged to someone else. Then only the man is to be put to death; 
05Dt 22:26 nothing is to be done to the woman, because she has not committed a sin worthy of death. This case is the same as when one man attacks another man and murders him. 
05Dt 22:27 The man raped the engaged woman in the countryside, and although she cried for help, there was no one to help her. 
05Dt 22:28 "Suppose a man is caught raping a young woman who is not engaged. 
05Dt 22:29 He is to pay her father the bride price of fifty pieces of silver, and she is to become his wife, because he forced her to have intercourse with him. He can never divorce her as long as he lives. 
05Dt 22:30 "No man is to disgrace his father by having intercourse with any of his father's wives. 
05Dt 23:1 "No man who has been castrated or whose penis has been cut off may be included among the LORD's people. 
05Dt 23:2 "No one born out of wedlock or any descendant of such a person, even in the tenth generation, may be included among the LORD's people. 
05Dt 23:3 "No Ammonite or Moabite - or any of their descendants, even in the tenth generation - may be included among the LORD's people. 
05Dt 23:4 They refused to provide you with food and water when you were on your way out of Egypt, and they hired Balaam son of Beor, from the city of Pethor in Mesopotamia, to curse you. 
05Dt 23:5 But the LORD your God would not listen to Balaam; instead he turned the curse into a blessing, because he loved you. 
05Dt 23:6 As long as you are a nation, never do anything to help these nations or to make them prosperous. 
05Dt 23:7 "Do not despise the Edomites; they are your relatives. And do not despise the Egyptians; you once lived in their land. 
05Dt 23:8 From the third generation onward their descendants may be included among the LORD's people. 
05Dt 23:9 "When you are in camp in time of war, you are to avoid anything that would make you ritually unclean. 
05Dt 23:10 If a man becomes unclean because he has had a wet dream during the night, he is to go outside the camp and stay there. 
05Dt 23:11 Toward evening he is to wash himself, and at sunset he may come back into camp. 
05Dt 23:12 "You are to have a place outside the camp where you can go when you need to relieve yourselves. 
05Dt 23:13 Carry a stick as part of your equipment, so that when you have a bowel movement you can dig a hole and cover it up. 
05Dt 23:14 Keep your camp ritually clean, because the LORD your God is with you in your camp to protect you and to give you victory over your enemies. Do not do anything indecent that would cause the LORD to turn his back on you. 
05Dt 23:15 "If slaves run away from their owners and come to you for protection, do not send them back. 
05Dt 23:16 They may live in any of your towns that they choose, and you are not to treat them harshly. 
05Dt 23:17 "No Israelite, man or woman, is to become a temple prostitute. 
05Dt 23:18 Also, no money earned in this way may be brought into the house of the LORD your God in fulfillment of a vow. The LORD hates temple prostitutes. 
05Dt 23:19 "When you lend money or food or anything else to Israelites, do not charge them interest. 
05Dt 23:20 You may charge interest on what you lend to foreigners, but not on what you lend to Israelites. Obey this rule, and the LORD your God will bless everything you do in the land that you are going to occupy. 
05Dt 23:21 "When you make a vow to the LORD your God, do not put off doing what you promised; the LORD will hold you to your vow, and it is a sin not to keep it. 
05Dt 23:22 It is no sin not to make a vow to the LORD, 
05Dt 23:23 but if you make one voluntarily, be sure that you keep it. 
05Dt 23:24 "When you walk along a path in someone else's vineyard, you may eat all the grapes you want, but you must not carry any away in a container. 
05Dt 23:25 When you walk along a path in someone else's grainfield, you may eat all the grain you can pull off with your hands, but you must not cut any grain with a sickle. 
05Dt 24:1 "Suppose a man marries a woman and later decides that he doesn't want her, because he finds something about her that he doesn't like. So he writes out divorce papers, gives them to her, and sends her away from his home. 
05Dt 24:2 Then suppose she marries another man, 
05Dt 24:3 and he also decides that he doesn't want her, so he also writes out divorce papers, gives them to her, and sends her away from his home. Or suppose her second husband dies. 
05Dt 24:4 In either case, her first husband is not to marry her again; he is to consider her defiled. If he married her again, it would be offensive to the LORD. You are not to commit such a terrible sin in the land that the LORD your God is giving you. 
05Dt 24:5 "When a man is newly married, he is not to be drafted into military service or any other public duty; he is to be excused from duty for one year, so that he can stay at home and make his wife happy. 
05Dt 24:6 "When you lend someone something, you are not to take as security his millstones used for grinding his grain. This would take away the family's means of preparing food to stay alive. 
05Dt 24:7 "If any of you kidnap Israelites and make them your slaves or sell them into slavery, you are to be put to death. In this way your nation will get rid of this evil. 
05Dt 24:8 "When you are suffering from a dreaded skin disease, be sure to do exactly what the levitical priests tell you; follow the instructions that I have given them. 
05Dt 24:9 Remember what the LORD your God did to Miriam as you were coming from Egypt. 
05Dt 24:10 "When you lend someone something, do not go into his house to get the garment he is going to give you as security; 
05Dt 24:11 wait outside and let him bring it to you himself. 
05Dt 24:12 If he is poor, do not keep it overnight; 
05Dt 24:13 return it to him each evening, so that he can have it to sleep in. Then he will be grateful, and the LORD your God will be pleased with you. 
05Dt 24:14 "Do not cheat poor and needy hired servants, whether they are Israelites or foreigners living in one of your towns. 
05Dt 24:15 Each day before sunset pay them for that day's work; they need the money and have counted on getting it. If you do not pay them, they will cry out against you to the LORD, and you will be guilty of sin. 
05Dt 24:16 "Parents are not to be put to death for crimes committed by their children, and children are not to be put to death for crimes committed by their parents; people are to be put to death only for a crime they themselves have committed. 
05Dt 24:17 "Do not deprive foreigners and orphans of their rights; and do not take a widow's garment as security for a loan. 
05Dt 24:18 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that the LORD your God set you free; that is why I have given you this command. 
05Dt 24:19 "When you gather your crops and fail to bring in some of the grain that you have cut, do not go back for it; it is to be left for the foreigners, orphans, and widows, so that the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do. 
05Dt 24:20 When you have picked your olives once, do not go back and get those that are left; they are for the foreigners, orphans, and widows. 
05Dt 24:21 When you have gathered your grapes once, do not go back over the vines a second time; the grapes that are left are for the foreigners, orphans, and widows. 
05Dt 24:22 Never forget that you were slaves in Egypt; that is why I have given you this command. 
05Dt 25:1 "Suppose two Israelites go to court to settle a dispute, and one is declared innocent and the other guilty. 
05Dt 25:2 If the guilty one is sentenced to be beaten, the judge is to make him lie face downward and have him whipped. The number of lashes will depend on the crime he has committed. 
05Dt 25:3 He may be given as many as forty lashes, but no more; more than that would humiliate him publicly. 
05Dt 25:4 "Do not muzzle an ox when you are using it to thresh grain. 
05Dt 25:5 "If two brothers live on the same property and one of them dies, leaving no son, then his widow is not to be married to someone outside the family; it is the duty of the dead man's brother to marry her. 
05Dt 25:6 The first son that they have will be considered the son of the dead man, so that his family line will continue in Israel. 
05Dt 25:7 But if the dead man's brother does not want to marry her, she is to go before the town leaders and say, 'My husband's brother will not do his duty; he refuses to give his brother a descendant among the people of Israel.' 
05Dt 25:8 Then the town leaders are to summon him and speak to him. If he still refuses to marry her, 
05Dt 25:9 his brother's widow is to go up to him in the presence of the town leaders, take off one of his sandals, spit in his face, and say, 'This is what happens to the man who refuses to give his brother a descendant.' 
05Dt 25:10 His family will be known in Israel as 'the family of the man who had his sandal pulled off.' 
05Dt 25:11 "If two men are having a fight and the wife of one tries to help her husband by grabbing hold of the other man's genitals, 
05Dt 25:12 show her no mercy; cut off her hand. 
05Dt 25:13 "Do not cheat when you use weights and measures. 
05Dt 25:14 (SEE v.13)
05Dt 25:15 Use true and honest weights and measures, so that you may live a long time in the land that the LORD your God is giving you. 
05Dt 25:16 The LORD hates people who cheat. 
05Dt 25:17 "Remember what the Amalekites did to you as you were coming from Egypt. 
05Dt 25:18 They had no fear of God, and so they attacked you from the rear when you were tired and exhausted, and killed all who were straggling behind. 
05Dt 25:19 So then, when the LORD your God has given you the land and made you safe from all your enemies who live around you, be sure to kill all the Amalekites, so that no one will remember them any longer. Do not forget! 
05Dt 26:1 "After you have occupied the land that the LORD your God is giving you and have settled there, 
05Dt 26:2 each of you must place in a basket the first part of each crop that you harvest and you must take it with you to the one place of worship. 
05Dt 26:3 Go to the priest in charge at that time and say to him, 'I now acknowledge to the LORD my God that I have entered the land that he promised our ancestors to give us.' 
05Dt 26:4 "The priest will take the basket from you and place it before the altar of the LORD your God. 
05Dt 26:5 Then, in the LORD's presence you will recite these words: 'My ancestor was a wandering Aramean, who took his family to Egypt to live. They were few in number when they went there, but they became a large and powerful nation. 
05Dt 26:6 The Egyptians treated us harshly and forced us to work as slaves. 
05Dt 26:7 Then we cried out for help to the LORD, the God of our ancestors. He heard us and saw our suffering, hardship, and misery. 
05Dt 26:8 By his great power and strength he rescued us from Egypt. He worked miracles and wonders, and caused terrifying things to happen. 
05Dt 26:9 He brought us here and gave us this rich and fertile land. 
05Dt 26:10 So now I bring to the LORD the first part of the harvest that he has given me.' "Then set the basket down in the LORD's presence and worship there. 
05Dt 26:11 Be grateful for the good things that the LORD your God has given you and your family; and let the Levites and the foreigners who live among you join in the celebration. 
05Dt 26:12 "Every third year give the tithe - a tenth of your crops - to the Levites, the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows, so that in every community they will have all they need to eat. When you have done this, 
05Dt 26:13 say to the LORD, 'None of the sacred tithe is left in my house; I have given it to the Levites, the foreigners, the orphans, and the widows, as you commanded me to do. I have not disobeyed or forgotten any of your commands concerning the tithe. 
05Dt 26:14 I have not eaten any of it when I was mourning; I have not taken any of it out of my house when I was ritually unclean; and I have not given any of it as an offering for the dead. I have obeyed you, O LORD; I have done everything you commanded concerning the tithe. 
05Dt 26:15 Look down from your holy place in heaven and bless your people Israel; bless also the rich and fertile land that you have given us, as you promised our ancestors.' 
05Dt 26:16 "Today the LORD your God commands you to obey all his laws; so obey them faithfully with all your heart. 
05Dt 26:17 Today you have acknowledged the LORD as your God; you have promised to obey him, to keep all his laws, and to do all that he commands. 
05Dt 26:18 Today the LORD has accepted you as his own people, as he promised you; and he commands you to obey all his laws. 
05Dt 26:19 He will make you greater than any other nation that he has created, and you will bring praise and honor to his name. You will be his own people, as he promised." 
05Dt 27:1 Then Moses, together with the leaders of Israel, said to the people, "Obey all the instructions that I am giving you today. 
05Dt 27:2 On the day you cross the Jordan River and enter the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you are to set up some large stones, cover them with plaster, 
05Dt 27:3 and write on them all these laws and teachings. When you have entered the rich and fertile land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, promised you, 
05Dt 27:4 and you are on the other side of the Jordan, set up these stones on Mount Ebal, as I am instructing you today, and cover them with plaster. 
05Dt 27:5 Build an altar there made of stones that have had no iron tools used on them, 
05Dt 27:6 because any altar you build for the LORD your God must be made of uncut stones. There you are to offer the sacrifices that are to be burned, 
05Dt 27:7 and there you are to sacrifice and eat your fellowship offerings and be grateful in the presence of the LORD your God. 
05Dt 27:8 On the stones covered with plaster write clearly every word of God's laws." 
05Dt 27:9 Then Moses, together with the levitical priests, said to all the people of Israel, "Give me your attention, people of Israel, and listen to me. Today you have become the people of the LORD your God; 
05Dt 27:10 so obey him and keep all his laws that I am giving you today." 
05Dt 27:11 Then Moses said to the people of Israel, 
05Dt 27:12 "After you have crossed the Jordan, the following tribes are to stand on Mount Gerizim when the blessings are pronounced on the people: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. 
05Dt 27:13 And the following tribes will stand on Mount Ebal when the curses are pronounced: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 
05Dt 27:14 The Levites will speak these words in a loud voice�� 05Dt 27:15 " 'God's curse on anyone who makes an idol of stone, wood, or metal and secretly worships it; the LORD hates idolatry.' "And all the people will answer, 'Amen!' 
05Dt 27:16 " 'God's curse on anyone who dishonors his father or mother.' "And all the people will answer, 'Amen!' 
05Dt 27:17 " 'God's curse on anyone who moves a neighbor's property line.' "And all the people will answer, 'Amen!' 
05Dt 27:18 " 'God's curse on anyone who leads a blind person in the wrong direction.' "And all the people will answer, 'Amen!' 
05Dt 27:19 " 'God's curse on anyone who deprives foreigners, orphans, and widows of their rights.' "And all the people will answer, 'Amen!' 
05Dt 27:20 " 'God's curse on anyone who disgraces his father by having intercourse with any of his father's wives.' "And all the people will answer, 'Amen!' 
05Dt 27:21 " 'God's curse on anyone who has sexual relations with an animal.' "And all the people will answer, 'Amen!' 
05Dt 27:22 " 'God's curse on anyone who has intercourse with his sister or half sister.' "And all the people will answer, 'Amen!' 
05Dt 27:23 " 'God's curse on anyone who has intercourse with his mother-in-law.' "And all the people will answer, 'Amen!' 
05Dt 27:24 " 'God's curse on anyone who secretly commits murder.' "And all the people will answer, 'Amen!' 
05Dt 27:25 " 'God's curse on anyone who accepts money to murder an innocent person.' "And all the people will answer, 'Amen!' 
05Dt 27:26 " 'God's curse on anyone who does not obey all of God's laws and teachings.' "And all the people will answer, 'Amen!' 
05Dt 28:1 "If you obey the LORD your God and faithfully keep all his commands that I am giving you today, he will make you greater than any other nation on earth. 
05Dt 28:2 Obey the LORD your God and all these blessings will be yours�� 05Dt 28:3 "The LORD will bless your towns and your fields. 
05Dt 28:4 "The LORD will bless you with many children, with abundant crops, and with many cattle and sheep.

05Dt 28:9 "If you obey the LORD your God and do everything he commands, he will make you his own people, as he has promised. 
05Dt 28:10 Then all the peoples on earth will see that the LORD has chosen you to be his own people, and they will be afraid of you. 
05Dt 28:11 The LORD will give you many children, many cattle, and abundant crops in the land that he promised your ancestors to give you. 
05Dt 28:12 He will send rain in season from his rich storehouse in the sky and bless all your work, so that you will lend to many nations, but you will not have to borrow from any. 
05Dt 28:13 The LORD your God will make you the leader among the nations and not a follower; you will always prosper and never fail if you obey faithfully all his commands that I am giving you today. 
05Dt 28:14 But you must never disobey them in any way, or worship and serve other gods. 
05Dt 28:15 "But if you disobey the LORD your God and do not faithfully keep all his commands and laws that I am giving you today, all these evil things will happen to you�� 05Dt 28:16 "The LORD will curse your towns and your fields. 
05Dt 28:17 "The LORD will curse your grain crops and the food you prepare from them. 
05Dt 28:18 "The LORD will curse you by giving you only a few children, poor crops, and few cattle and sheep. 
05Dt 28:19 "The LORD will curse everything you do. 
05Dt 28:20 "If you do evil and reject the LORD, he will bring on you disaster, confusion, and trouble in everything you do, until you are quickly and completely destroyed. 
05Dt 28:21 He will send disease after disease on you until there is not one of you left in the land that you are about to occupy. 
05Dt 28:22 The LORD will strike you with infectious diseases, with swelling and fever; he will send drought and scorching winds to destroy your crops. These disasters will be with you until you die. 
05Dt 28:23 No rain will fall, and your ground will become as hard as iron. 
05Dt 28:24 Instead of rain, the LORD will send down duststorms and sandstorms until you are destroyed. 
05Dt 28:25 "The LORD will give your enemies victory over you. You will attack them from one direction, but you will run from them in all directions, and all the people on earth will be terrified when they see what happens to you. 
05Dt 28:26 When you die, birds and wild animals will come and eat your bodies, and there will be no one to scare them off. 
05Dt 28:27 The LORD will send boils on you, as he did on the Egyptians. He will make your bodies break out with sores. You will be covered with scabs, and you will itch, but there will be no cure. 
05Dt 28:28 The LORD will make you lose your mind; he will strike you with blindness and confusion. 
05Dt 28:29 You will grope about in broad daylight like someone blind, and you will not be able to find your way. You will not prosper in anything you do. You will be constantly oppressed and robbed, and there will be no one to help you. 
05Dt 28:30 "You will be engaged to a young woman - but someone else will marry her. You will build a house - but never live in it. You will plant a vineyard - but never eat its grapes. 
05Dt 28:31 Your cattle will be butchered before your very eyes, but you will not eat any of the meat. Your donkeys will be dragged away while you look on, and they will not be given back to you. Your sheep will be given to your enemies, and there will be no one to help you. 
05Dt 28:32 Your sons and daughters will be given as slaves to foreigners while you look on. Every day you will strain your eyes, looking in vain for your children to return. 
05Dt 28:33 A foreign nation will take all the crops that you have worked so hard to grow, while you receive nothing but constant oppression and harsh treatment. 
05Dt 28:34 Your sufferings will make you lose your mind. 
05Dt 28:35 The LORD will cover your legs with incurable, painful sores; boils will cover you from head to foot. 
05Dt 28:36 "The LORD will take you and your king away to a foreign land, where neither you nor your ancestors ever lived before; there you will serve gods made of wood and stone. 
05Dt 28:37 In the countries to which the LORD will scatter you, the people will be shocked at what has happened to you; they will make fun of you and ridicule you. 
05Dt 28:38 "You will plant plenty of seed, but reap only a small harvest, because the locusts will eat your crops. 
05Dt 28:39 You will plant vineyards and take care of them, but you will not gather their grapes or drink wine from them, because worms will eat the vines. 
05Dt 28:40 Olive trees will grow everywhere in your land, but you will not have any olive oil, because the olives will drop off. 
05Dt 28:41 You will have sons and daughters, but you will lose them, because they will be taken away as prisoners of war. 
05Dt 28:42 All your trees and crops will be devoured by insects. 
05Dt 28:43 "Foreigners who live in your land will gain more and more power, while you gradually lose yours. 
05Dt 28:44 They will have money to lend you, but you will have none to lend them. In the end they will be your rulers. 
05Dt 28:45 "All these disasters will come on you, and they will be with you until you are destroyed, because you did not obey the LORD your God and keep all the laws that he gave you. 
05Dt 28:46 They will be the evidence of God's judgment on you and your descendants forever. 
05Dt 28:47 The LORD blessed you in every way, but you would not serve him with glad and joyful hearts. 
05Dt 28:48 So then, you will serve the enemies that the LORD is going to send against you. You will be hungry, thirsty, and naked - in need of everything. The LORD will oppress you harshly until you are destroyed. 
05Dt 28:49 The LORD will bring against you a nation from the ends of the earth, a nation whose language you do not know. They will swoop down on you like an eagle. 
05Dt 28:50 They will be ruthless and show no mercy to anyone, young or old. 
05Dt 28:51 They will eat your livestock and your crops, and you will starve to death. They will not leave you any grain, wine, olive oil, cattle, or sheep; and you will die. 
05Dt 28:52 They will attack every town in the land that the LORD your God is giving you, and the high, fortified walls in which you trust will fall. 
05Dt 28:53 "When your enemies are besieging your towns, you will become so desperate for food that you will even eat the children that the LORD your God has given you. 
05Dt 28:54 Even the most refined man of noble birth will become so desperate during the siege that he will eat some of his own children because he has no other food. 
05Dt 28:55 He will not even give any to his brother or to the wife he loves or to any of his children who are left. 
05Dt 28:56 Even the most refined woman of noble birth, so rich that she has never had to walk anywhere, will behave in the same way. 
05Dt 28:57 When the enemy besieges her town, she will become so desperate for food that she will secretly eat her newborn child and the afterbirth as well. She will not share them with the husband she loves or with any of her children. 
05Dt 28:58 "If you do not obey faithfully all of God's teachings that are written in this book and if you do not honor the wonderful and awesome name of the LORD your God, 
05Dt 28:59 he will send on you and on your descendants incurable diseases and horrible epidemics that can never be stopped. 
05Dt 28:60 He will bring on you once again all the dreadful diseases you experienced in Egypt, and you will never recover. 
05Dt 28:61 He will also send all kinds of diseases and epidemics that are not mentioned in this book of God's laws and teachings, and you will be destroyed. 
05Dt 28:62 Although you become as numerous as the stars in the sky, only a few of you will survive, because you did not obey the LORD your God. 
05Dt 28:63 Just as the LORD took delight in making you prosper and in making you increase in number, so he will take delight in destroying you and in bringing ruin on you. You will be uprooted from the land that you are about to occupy. 
05Dt 28:64 "The LORD will scatter you among all the nations, from one end of the earth to the other, and there you will serve gods made of wood and stone, gods that neither you nor your ancestors have ever worshiped before. 
05Dt 28:65 You will find no peace anywhere, no place to call your own; the LORD will overwhelm you with anxiety, hopelessness, and despair. 
05Dt 28:66 Your life will always be in danger. Day and night you will be filled with terror, and you will live in constant fear of death. 
05Dt 28:67 Your hearts will pound with fear at everything you see. Every morning you will wish for evening; every evening you will wish for morning. 
05Dt 28:68 The LORD will send you back to Egypt in ships, even though he said that you would never have to go there again. There you will try to sell yourselves to your enemies as slaves, but no one will want to buy you." 
05Dt 29:1 These are the terms of the covenant that the LORD commanded Moses to make with the people of Israel in the land of Moab; all this was in addition to the covenant which the LORD had made with them at Mount Sinai. 
05Dt 29:2 Moses called together all the people of Israel and said to them, "You saw for yourselves what the LORD did to the king of Egypt, to his officials, and to his entire country. 
05Dt 29:3 You saw the terrible plagues, the miracles, and the great wonders that the LORD performed. 
05Dt 29:4 But to this very day he has not let you understand what you have experienced. 
05Dt 29:5 For forty years the LORD led you through the desert, and your clothes and sandals never wore out. 
05Dt 29:6 You did not have bread to eat or wine or beer to drink, but the LORD provided for your needs in order to teach you that he is your God. 
05Dt 29:7 And when we came to this place, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out to fight against us. But we defeated them, 
05Dt 29:8 took their land, and divided it among the tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh. 
05Dt 29:9 Obey faithfully all the terms of this covenant, so that you will be successful in everything you do. 
05Dt 29:10 "Today you are standing in the presence of the LORD your God, all of you - your leaders and officials, your men, 
05Dt 29:11 women, and children, and the foreigners who live among you and cut wood and carry water for you. 
05Dt 29:12 You are here today to enter into this covenant that the LORD your God is making with you and to accept its obligations, 
05Dt 29:13 so that the LORD may now confirm you as his people and be your God, as he promised you and your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
05Dt 29:14 You are not the only ones with whom the LORD is making this covenant with its obligations. 
05Dt 29:15 He is making it with all of us who stand here in his presence today and also with our descendants who are not yet born. 
05Dt 29:16 "You remember what life was like in Egypt and what it was like to travel through the territory of other nations. 
05Dt 29:17 You saw their disgusting idols made of wood, stone, silver, and gold. 
05Dt 29:18 Make sure that no man, woman, family, or tribe standing here today turns from the LORD our God to worship the gods of other nations. This would be like a root that grows to be a bitter and poisonous plant. 
05Dt 29:19 Make sure that there is no one here today who hears these solemn demands and yet convinces himself that all will be well with him, even if he stubbornly goes his own way. That would destroy all of you, good and evil alike. 
05Dt 29:20 The LORD will not forgive such a man. Instead, the LORD's burning anger will flame up against him, and all the disasters written in this book will fall on him until the LORD has destroyed him completely. 
05Dt 29:21 The LORD will make an example of him before all the tribes of Israel and will bring disaster on him in accordance with all the curses listed in the covenant that is written in this book of the LORD's teachings. 
05Dt 29:22 "In future generations your descendants and foreigners from distant lands will see the disasters and sufferings that the LORD has brought on your land. 
05Dt 29:23 The fields will be a barren waste, covered with sulfur and salt; nothing will be planted, and not even weeds will grow there. Your land will be like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, of Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD destroyed when he was furiously angry. 
05Dt 29:24 Then the whole world will ask, 'Why did the LORD do this to their land? What was the reason for his fierce anger?' 
05Dt 29:25 And the answer will be, 'It is because the LORD's people broke the covenant they had made with him, the God of their ancestors, when he brought them out of Egypt. 
05Dt 29:26 They served other gods that they had never worshiped before, gods that the LORD had forbidden them to worship. 
05Dt 29:27 And so the LORD became angry with his people and brought on their land all the disasters written in this book. 
05Dt 29:28 The LORD became furiously angry, and in his great anger he uprooted them from their land and threw them into a foreign land, and there they are today.' 
05Dt 29:29 "There are some things that the LORD our God has kept secret; but he has revealed his Law, and we and our descendants are to obey it forever. 
05Dt 30:1 "I have now given you a choice between a blessing and a curse. When all these things have happened to you, and you are living among the nations where the LORD your God has scattered you, you will remember the choice I gave you. 
05Dt 30:2 If you and your descendants will turn back to the LORD and with all your heart obey his commands that I am giving you today, 
05Dt 30:3 then the LORD your God will have mercy on you. He will bring you back from the nations where he has scattered you, and he will make you prosperous again. 
05Dt 30:4 Even if you are scattered to the farthest corners of the earth, the LORD your God will gather you together and bring you back, 
05Dt 30:5 so that you may again take possession of the land where your ancestors once lived. And he will make you more prosperous and more numerous than your ancestors ever were. 
05Dt 30:6 The LORD your God will give you and your descendants obedient hearts, so that you will love him with all your heart, and you will continue to live in that land. 
05Dt 30:7 He will turn all these curses against your enemies, who hated you and oppressed you, 
05Dt 30:8 and you will again obey him and keep all his commands that I am giving you today. 
05Dt 30:9 The LORD will make you prosperous in all that you do; you will have many children and a lot of livestock, and your fields will produce abundant crops. He will be as glad to make you prosperous as he was to make your ancestors prosperous, 
05Dt 30:10 but you will have to obey him and keep all his laws that are written in this book of his teachings. You will have to turn to him with all your heart. 
05Dt 30:11 "The command that I am giving you today is not too difficult or beyond your reach. 
05Dt 30:12 It is not up in the sky. You do not have to ask, 'Who will go up and bring it down for us, so that we can hear it and obey it?' 
05Dt 30:13 Nor is it on the other side of the ocean. You do not have to ask, 'Who will go across the ocean and bring it to us, so that we may hear it and obey it?' 
05Dt 30:14 No, it is here with you. You know it and can quote it, so now obey it. 
05Dt 30:15 "Today I am giving you a choice between good and evil, between life and death. 
05Dt 30:16 If you obey the commands of the LORD your God, which I give you today, if you love him, obey him, and keep all his laws, then you will prosper and become a nation of many people. The LORD your God will bless you in the land that you are about to occupy. 
05Dt 30:17 But if you disobey and refuse to listen, and are led away to worship other gods, 
05Dt 30:18 you will be destroyed - I warn you here and now. You will not live long in that land across the Jordan that you are about to occupy. 
05Dt 30:19 I am now giving you the choice between life and death, between God's blessing and God's curse, and I call heaven and earth to witness the choice you make. Choose life. 
05Dt 30:20 Love the LORD your God, obey him and be faithful to him, and then you and your descendants will live long in the land that he promised to give your ancestors, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." 
05Dt 31:1 Moses continued speaking to the people of Israel, 
05Dt 31:2 and said, "I am now a hundred and twenty years old and am no longer able to be your leader. And besides this, the LORD has told me that I will not cross the Jordan. 
05Dt 31:3 The LORD your God himself will go before you and destroy the nations living there, so that you can occupy their land; and Joshua will be your leader, as the LORD has said. 
05Dt 31:4 The LORD will destroy those people, just as he defeated Sihon and Og, kings of the Amorites, and destroyed their country. 
05Dt 31:5 The LORD will give you victory over them, and you are to treat them exactly as I have told you. 
05Dt 31:6 Be determined and confident. Do not be afraid of them. Your God, the LORD himself, will be with you. He will not fail you or abandon you." 
05Dt 31:7 Then Moses called Joshua and said to him in the presence of all the people of Israel, "Be determined and confident; you are the one who will lead these people to occupy the land that the LORD promised to their ancestors. 
05Dt 31:8 The LORD himself will lead you and be with you. He will not fail you or abandon you, so do not lose courage or be afraid." 
05Dt 31:9 So Moses wrote down God's Law and gave it to the levitical priests, who were in charge of the LORD's Covenant Box, and to the leaders of Israel. 
05Dt 31:10 He commanded them, "At the end of every seven years, when the year that debts are canceled comes around, read this aloud at the Festival of Shelters. 
05Dt 31:11 Read it to the people of Israel when they come to worship the LORD your God at the one place of worship. 
05Dt 31:12 Call together all the men, women, and children, and the foreigners who live in your towns, so that everyone may hear it and learn to honor the LORD your God and to obey his teachings faithfully. 
05Dt 31:13 In this way your descendants who have never heard the Law of the LORD your God will hear it. And so they will learn to obey him as long as they live in the land that you are about to occupy across the Jordan." 
05Dt 31:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "You do not have much longer to live. Call Joshua and bring him to the Tent, so that I may give him his instructions." Moses and Joshua went to the Tent, 
05Dt 31:15 and the LORD appeared to them there in a pillar of cloud that stood by the door of the Tent. 
05Dt 31:16 The LORD said to Moses, "You will soon die, and after your death the people will become unfaithful to me and break the covenant that I made with them. They will abandon me and worship the pagan gods of the land they are about to enter. 
05Dt 31:17 When that happens, I will become angry with them; I will abandon them, and they will be destroyed. Many terrible disasters will come upon them, and then they will realize that these things are happening to them because I, their God, am no longer with them. 
05Dt 31:18 And I will refuse to help them then, because they have done evil and worshiped other gods. 
05Dt 31:19 "Now, write down this song. Teach it to the people of Israel, so that it will stand as evidence against them. 
05Dt 31:20 I will take them into this rich and fertile land, as I promised their ancestors. There they will have all the food they want, and they will live comfortably. But they will turn away and worship other gods. They will reject me and break my covenant, 
05Dt 31:21 and many terrible disasters will come on them. But this song will still be sung, and it will stand as evidence against them. Even now, before I take them into the land that I promised to give them, I know what they are thinking." 
05Dt 31:22 That same day Moses wrote down the song and taught it to the people of Israel. 
05Dt 31:23 Then the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun and told him, "Be confident and determined. You will lead the people of Israel into the land that I promised them, and I will be with you." 
05Dt 31:24 Moses wrote God's Law in a book, taking care not to leave out anything. 
05Dt 31:25 When he finished, he said to the levitical priests, who were in charge of the LORD's Covenant Box, 
05Dt 31:26 "Take this book of God's Law and place it beside the Covenant Box of the LORD your God, so that it will remain there as a witness against his people. 
05Dt 31:27 I know how stubborn and rebellious they are. They have rebelled against the LORD during my lifetime, and they will rebel even more after I am dead. 
05Dt 31:28 Assemble all your tribal leaders and officials before me, so that I can tell them these things; I will call heaven and earth to be my witnesses against them. 
05Dt 31:29 I know that after my death the people will become wicked and reject what I have taught them. And in time to come they will meet with disaster, because they will have made the LORD angry by doing what he has forbidden." 
05Dt 31:30 Then Moses recited the entire song while all the people of Israel listened. 
05Dt 32:1 "Earth and sky, hear my words, listen closely to what I say. 
05Dt 32:2 My teaching will fall like drops of rain and form on the earth like dew. My words will fall like showers on young plants, like gentle rain on tender grass. 
05Dt 32:3 I will praise the name of the LORD, and his people will tell of his greatness. 
05Dt 32:4 "The LORD is your mighty defender, perfect and just in all his ways; Your God is faithful and true; he does what is right and fair. 
05Dt 32:5 But you are unfaithful, unworthy to be his people, a sinful and deceitful nation. 
05Dt 32:6 Is this the way you should treat the LORD, you foolish, senseless people? He is your father, your Creator, he made you into a nation. 
05Dt 32:7 "Think of the past, of the time long ago; ask your parents to tell you what happened, ask the old people to tell of the past. 
05Dt 32:8 The Most High assigned nations their lands; he determined where peoples should live. He assigned to each nation a heavenly being, 
05Dt 32:9 but Jacob's descendants he chose for himself. 
05Dt 32:10 "He found them wandering through the desert, a desolate, wind-swept wilderness. He protected them and cared for them, as he would protect himself. 
05Dt 32:11 Like an eagle teaching its young to fly, catching them safely on its spreading wings, the LORD kept Israel from falling. 
05Dt 32:12 The LORD alone led his people without the help of a foreign god. 
05Dt 32:13 "He let them rule the highlands, and they ate what grew in the fields. They found wild honey among the rocks; their olive trees flourished in stony ground. 
05Dt 32:14 Their cows and goats gave plenty of milk; they had the best sheep, goats, and cattle, the finest wheat, and the choicest wine. 
05Dt 32:15 "The LORD's people grew rich, but rebellious; they were fat and stuffed with food. They abandoned God their Creator and rejected their mighty savior. 
05Dt 32:16 Their idolatry made the LORD jealous; the evil they did made him angry. 
05Dt 32:17 They sacrificed to gods that are not real, new gods their ancestors had never known, gods that Israel had never obeyed. 
05Dt 32:18 They forgot their God, their mighty savior, the one who had given them life. 
05Dt 32:19 "When the LORD saw this, he was angry and rejected his sons and daughters. 
05Dt 32:20 'I will no longer help them,' he said; 'then I will see what happens to them, those stubborn, unfaithful people. 
05Dt 32:21 With their idols they have made me angry, jealous with their so-called gods, gods that are really not gods. So I will use a so-called nation to make them angry; I will make them jealous with a nation of fools. 
05Dt 32:22 My anger will flame up like fire and burn everything on earth. It will reach to the world below and consume the roots of the mountains. 
05Dt 32:23 " 'I will bring on them endless disasters and use all my arrows against them. 
05Dt 32:24 They will die from hunger and fever; they will die from terrible diseases. I will send wild animals to attack them, and poisonous snakes to bite them. 
05Dt 32:25 War will bring death in the streets; terrors will strike in the homes. Young men and young women will die; neither babies nor old people will be spared. 
05Dt 32:26 I would have destroyed them completely, so that no one would remember them. 
05Dt 32:27 But I could not let their enemies boast that they had defeated my people, when it was I myself who had crushed them.' 
05Dt 32:28 "Israel is a nation without sense; they have no wisdom at all. 
05Dt 32:29 They fail to see why they were defeated; they cannot understand what happened. 
05Dt 32:30 Why were a thousand defeated by one, and ten thousand by only two? The LORD, their God, had abandoned them; their mighty God had given them up. 
05Dt 32:31 Their enemies know that their own gods are weak, not mighty like Israel's God. 
05Dt 32:32 Their enemies, corrupt as Sodom and Gomorrah, are like vines that bear bitter and poisonous grapes, 
05Dt 32:33 like wine made from the venom of snakes. 
05Dt 32:34 "The LORD remembers what their enemies have done; he waits for the right time to punish them. 
05Dt 32:35 The LORD will take revenge and punish them; the time will come when they will fall; the day of their doom is near. 
05Dt 32:36 The LORD will rescue his people when he sees that their strength is gone. He will have mercy on those who serve him, when he sees how helpless they are. 
05Dt 32:37 Then the LORD will ask his people, 'Where are those mighty gods you trusted? 
05Dt 32:38 You fed them the fat of your sacrifices and offered them wine to drink. Let them come and help you now; let them run to your rescue. 
05Dt 32:39 " 'I, and I alone, am God; no other god is real. I kill and I give life, I wound and I heal, and no one can oppose what I do. 
05Dt 32:40 As surely as I am the living God, I raise my hand and I vow 
05Dt 32:41 that I will sharpen my flashing sword and see that justice is done. I will take revenge on my enemies and punish those who hate me. 
05Dt 32:42 My arrows will drip with their blood, and my sword will kill all who oppose me. I will spare no one who fights against me; even the wounded and prisoners will die.' 
05Dt 32:43 "Nations, you must praise the LORD's people - he punishes all who kill them. He takes revenge on his enemies and forgives the sins of his people." 
05Dt 32:44 Moses and Joshua son of Nun recited this song, so that the people of Israel could hear it. 
05Dt 32:45 When Moses had finished giving God's teachings to the people, 
05Dt 32:46 he said, "Be sure to obey all these commands that I have given you today. Repeat them to your children, so that they may faithfully obey all of God's teachings. 
05Dt 32:47 These teachings are not empty words; they are your very life. Obey them and you will live long in that land across the Jordan that you are about to occupy." 
05Dt 32:48 That same day the LORD said to Moses, 
05Dt 32:49 "Go to the Abarim Mountains in the land of Moab opposite the city of Jericho; climb Mount Nebo and look at the land of Canaan that I am about to give the people of Israel. 
05Dt 32:50 You will die on that mountain as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor, 
05Dt 32:51 because both of you were unfaithful to me in the presence of the people of Israel. When you were at the waters of Meribah, near the town of Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin, you dishonored me in the presence of the people. 
05Dt 32:52 You will look at the land from a distance, but you will not enter the land that I am giving the people of Israel." 
05Dt 33:1 These are the blessings that Moses, the man of God, pronounced on the people of Israel before he died. 
05Dt 33:2 The LORD came from Mount Sinai; he rose like the sun over Edom and shone on his people from Mount Paran. Ten thousand angels were with him, a flaming fire at his right hand. 
05Dt 33:3 The LORD loves his people and protects those who belong to him. So we bow at his feet and obey his commands. 
05Dt 33:4 We obey the Law that Moses gave us, our nation's most treasured possession. 
05Dt 33:5 The LORD became king of his people Israel when their tribes and leaders were gathered together. 
05Dt 33:6 Moses said about the tribe of Reuben: "May Reuben never die out, Although their people are few." 
05Dt 33:7 About the tribe of Judah he said: " LORD, listen to their cry for help; Unite them again with the other tribes. Fight for them, LORD, And help them against their enemies." 
05Dt 33:8 About the tribe of Levi he said: "You, LORD, reveal your will by the Urim and Thummim Through your faithful servants, the Levites; You put them to the test at Massah And proved them true at the waters of Meribah. 
05Dt 33:9 They showed greater loyalty to you Than to parents, brothers, or children. They obeyed your commands And were faithful to your covenant. 
05Dt 33:10 They will teach your people to obey your Law; They will offer sacrifices on your altar. 
05Dt 33:11 LORD, help their tribe to grow strong; Be pleased with what they do. Crush all their enemies; Let them never rise again." 
05Dt 33:12 About the tribe of Benjamin he said: "This is the tribe the LORD loves and protects; He guards them all the day long, And he dwells in their midst." 
05Dt 33:13 About the tribe of Joseph he said: "May the LORD bless their land with rain And with water from under the earth. 
05Dt 33:14 May their land be blessed with sun-ripened fruit, Rich with the best fruits of each season. 
05Dt 33:15 May their ancient hills be covered with choice fruit. 
05Dt 33:16 May their land be filled with all that is good, Blessed by the goodness of the LORD, Who spoke from the burning bush. May these blessings come to the tribe of Joseph, Because he was the leader among his brothers. 
05Dt 33:17 Joseph has the strength of a bull, The horns of a wild ox. His horns are Manasseh's thousands And Ephraim's ten thousands. With them he gores the nations And pushes them to the ends of the earth." 
05Dt 33:18 About the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar he said: "May Zebulun be prosperous in their trade on the sea, And may Issachar's wealth increase at home. 
05Dt 33:19 They invite foreigners to their mountain And offer the right sacrifices there. They get their wealth from the sea And from the sand along the shore." 
05Dt 33:20 About the tribe of Gad he said: "Praise God, who made their territory large. Gad waits like a lion To tear off an arm or a scalp. 
05Dt 33:21 They took the best of the land for themselves; A leader's share was assigned to them. They obeyed the LORD's commands and laws When the leaders of Israel were gathered together." 
05Dt 33:22 About the tribe of Dan he said: "Dan is a young lion; He leaps out from Bashan." 
05Dt 33:23 About the tribe of Naphtali he said: "Naphtali is richly blessed by the LORD's good favor; Their land reaches to the south from Lake Galilee." 
05Dt 33:24 About the tribe of Asher he said: "Asher is blessed more than the other tribes. May he be the favorite of his brothers, And may his land be rich with olive trees. 
05Dt 33:25 May his towns be protected with iron gates, And may he always live secure." 
05Dt 33:26 People of Israel, no god is like your God, riding in splendor across the sky, riding through the clouds to come to your aid. 
05Dt 33:27 God has always been your defense; his eternal arms are your support. He drove out your enemies as you advanced, and told you to destroy them all. 
05Dt 33:28 So Jacob's descendants live in peace, secure in a land full of grain and wine, where dew from the sky waters the ground. 
05Dt 33:29 Israel, how happy you are! There is no one like you, a nation saved by the LORD. The LORD himself is your shield and your sword, to defend you and give you victory. Your enemies will come begging for mercy, and you will trample them down. 
05Dt 34:1 Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Mount Pisgah east of Jericho, and there the LORD showed him the whole land: the territory of Gilead as far north as the town of Dan; 
05Dt 34:2 the entire territory of Naphtali; the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh; the territory of Judah as far west as the Mediterranean Sea; 
05Dt 34:3 the southern part of Judah; and the plain that reaches from Zoar to Jericho, the city of palm trees. 
05Dt 34:4 Then the LORD said to Moses, "This is the land that I promised Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob I would give to their descendants. I have let you see it, but I will not let you go there." 
05Dt 34:5 So Moses, the LORD's servant, died there in the land of Moab, as the LORD had said he would. 
05Dt 34:6 The LORD buried him in a valley in Moab, opposite the town of Bethpeor, but to this day no one knows the exact place of his burial. 
05Dt 34:7 Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died; he was as strong as ever, and his eyesight was still good. 
05Dt 34:8 The people of Israel mourned for him for thirty days in the plains of Moab. 
05Dt 34:9 Joshua son of Nun was filled with wisdom, because Moses had appointed him to be his successor. The people of Israel obeyed Joshua and kept the commands that the LORD had given them through Moses. 
05Dt 34:10 There has never been a prophet in Israel like Moses; the LORD spoke with him face-to-face. 
05Dt 34:11 No other prophet has ever done miracles and wonders like those that the LORD sent Moses to perform against the king of Egypt, his officials, and the entire country. 
05Dt 34:12 No other prophet has been able to do the great and terrifying things that Moses did in the sight of all Israel.

06Jos 1:1 After the death of the LORD's servant Moses, the LORD spoke to Moses' helper, Joshua son of Nun. 
06Jos 1:2 He said, "My servant Moses is dead. Get ready now, you and all the people of Israel, and cross the Jordan River into the land that I am giving them. 
06Jos 1:3 As I told Moses, I have given you and all my people the entire land that you will be marching over. 
06Jos 1:4 Your borders will reach from the desert in the south to the Lebanon Mountains in the north; from the great Euphrates River in the east, through the Hittite country, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 
06Jos 1:5 Joshua, no one will be able to defeat you as long as you live. I will be with you as I was with Moses. I will always be with you; I will never abandon you. 
06Jos 1:6 Be determined and confident, for you will be the leader of these people as they occupy this land which I promised their ancestors. 
06Jos 1:7 Just be determined, be confident; and make sure that you obey the whole Law that my servant Moses gave you. Do not neglect any part of it and you will succeed wherever you go. 
06Jos 1:8 Be sure that the book of the Law is always read in your worship. Study it day and night, and make sure that you obey everything written in it. Then you will be prosperous and successful. 
06Jos 1:9 Remember that I have commanded you to be determined and confident! Do not be afraid or discouraged, for I, the LORD your God, am with you wherever you go." 
06Jos 1:10 Then Joshua ordered the leaders to 
06Jos 1:11 go through the camp and say to the people, "Get some food ready, because in three days you are going to cross the Jordan River to occupy the land that the LORD your God is giving you." 
06Jos 1:12 Joshua said to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and to half the tribe of Manasseh, 
06Jos 1:13 "Remember how the LORD's servant Moses told you that the LORD your God would give you this land on the east side of the Jordan as your home. 
06Jos 1:14 Your wives, your children, and your livestock will stay here, but your soldiers, armed for battle, will cross over ahead of the other Israelites in order to help them 
06Jos 1:15 until they have occupied the land west of the Jordan that the LORD your God has given them. When he has given safety to all the tribes of Israel, then you may come back and settle here in your own land east of the Jordan, which Moses, the LORD's servant, gave to you." 
06Jos 1:16 They answered Joshua, "We will do everything you have told us and will go anywhere you send us. 
06Jos 1:17 We will obey you, just as we always obeyed Moses, and may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses! 
06Jos 1:18 Whoever questions your authority or disobeys any of your orders will be put to death. Be determined and confident!" 
06Jos 2:1 Then Joshua sent two spies from the camp at Acacia with orders to go and secretly explore the land of Canaan, especially the city of Jericho. When they came to the city, they went to spend the night in the house of a prostitute named Rahab. 
06Jos 2:2 The king of Jericho heard that some Israelites had come that night to spy out the country, 
06Jos 2:3 so he sent word to Rahab: "The men in your house have come to spy out the whole country! Bring them out!" 
06Jos 2:4 "Some men did come to my house," she answered, "but I don't know where they were from. They left at sundown before the city gate was closed. 
06Jos 2:5 I didn't find out where they were going, but if you start after them quickly, you can catch them." 
06Jos 2:6 (Now Rahab had taken the two spies up on the roof and hidden them under some stalks of flax that she had put there.) 
06Jos 2:7 The king's men left the city, and then the gate was shut. They went looking for the Israelite spies as far as the place where the road crosses the Jordan. 
06Jos 2:8 Before the spies settled down for the night, Rahab went up on the roof 
06Jos 2:9 and said to them, "I know that the LORD has given you this land. Everyone in the country is terrified of you. 
06Jos 2:10 We have heard how the LORD dried up the Red Sea in front of you when you were leaving Egypt. We have also heard how you killed Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan. 
06Jos 2:11 We were afraid as soon as we heard about it; we have all lost our courage because of you. The LORD your God is God in heaven above and here on earth. 
06Jos 2:12 Now swear by him that you will treat my family as kindly as I have treated you, and give me some sign that I can trust you. 
06Jos 2:13 Promise me that you will save my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all their families! Don't let us be killed!" 
06Jos 2:14 The men said to her, "May God take our lives if we don't do as we say! If you do not tell anyone what we have been doing, we promise you that when the LORD gives us this land, we will treat you well." 
06Jos 2:15 Rahab lived in a house built into the city wall, so she let the men down from the window by a rope. 
06Jos 2:16 "Go into the hill country," she said, "or the king's men will find you. Hide there for three days until they come back. After that, you can go on your way." 
06Jos 2:17 The men said to her, "We will keep the promise that you have made us give. 
06Jos 2:18 This is what you must do. When we invade your land, tie this red cord to the window you let us down from. Get your father and mother, your brothers, and all your father's family together in your house. 
06Jos 2:19 If anyone goes out of the house, his death will be his own fault, and we will not be responsible; but if anyone in the house with you is harmed, then we will be responsible. 
06Jos 2:20 However, if you tell anyone what we have been doing, then we will not have to keep our promise which you have made us give you." 
06Jos 2:21 She agreed and sent them away. When they had gone, she tied the red cord to the window. 
06Jos 2:22 The spies went into the hills and hid. The king's men looked for them all over the countryside for three days, but they did not find them, so they returned to Jericho. 
06Jos 2:23 Then the two spies came down from the hills, crossed the river, and went back to Joshua. They told him everything that had happened, 
06Jos 2:24 and then said, "We are sure that the LORD has given us the whole country. All the people there are terrified of us." 
06Jos 3:1 The next morning Joshua and all the people of Israel got up early, left the camp at Acacia, and went to the Jordan, where they camped while waiting to cross it. 
06Jos 3:2 Three days later the leaders went through the camp 
06Jos 3:3 and told the people, "When you see the priests carrying the Covenant Box of the LORD your God, break camp and follow them. 
06Jos 3:4 You have never been here before, so they will show you the way to go. But do not get near the Covenant Box; stay about half a mile behind it." 
06Jos 3:5 Joshua told the people, "Purify yourselves, because tomorrow the LORD will perform miracles among you." 
06Jos 3:6 Then he told the priests to take the Covenant Box and go with it ahead of the people. They did as he said. 
06Jos 3:7 The LORD said to Joshua, "What I do today will make all the people of Israel begin to honor you as a great man, and they will realize that I am with you as I was with Moses. 
06Jos 3:8 Tell the priests carrying the Covenant Box that when they reach the river, they must wade in and stand near the bank." 
06Jos 3:9 Then Joshua said to the people, "Come here and listen to what the LORD your God has to say. 
06Jos 3:10 As you advance, he will surely drive out the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites. You will know that the living God is among you 
06Jos 3:11 when the Covenant Box of the Lord of all the earth crosses the Jordan ahead of you. 
06Jos 3:12 Now choose twelve men, one from each of the tribes of Israel. 
06Jos 3:13 When the priests who carry the Covenant Box of the LORD of all the earth put their feet in the water, the Jordan will stop flowing, and the water coming downstream will pile up in one place." 
06Jos 3:14 It was harvest time, and the river was in flood. When the people left the camp to cross the Jordan, the priests went ahead of them, carrying the Covenant Box. 
06Jos 3:15 As soon as the priests stepped into the river, 
06Jos 3:16 the water stopped flowing and piled up, far upstream at Adam, the city beside Zarethan. The flow downstream to the Dead Sea was completely cut off, and the people were able to cross over near Jericho. 
06Jos 3:17 While the people walked across on dry ground, the priests carrying the LORD's Covenant Box stood on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan until all the people had crossed over. 
06Jos 4:1 When the whole nation had crossed the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua, 
06Jos 4:2 "Choose twelve men, one from each tribe, 
06Jos 4:3 and command them to take twelve stones out of the middle of the Jordan, from the very place where the priests were standing. Tell them to carry these stones with them and to put them down where you camp tonight." 
06Jos 4:4 Then Joshua called the twelve men he had chosen, 
06Jos 4:5 and he told them, "Go into the Jordan ahead of the Covenant Box of the LORD your God. Each one of you take a stone on your shoulder, one for each of the tribes of Israel. 
06Jos 4:6 These stones will remind the people of what the LORD has done. In the future, when your children ask what these stones mean to you, 
06Jos 4:7 you will tell them that the water of the Jordan stopped flowing when the LORD's Covenant Box crossed the river. These stones will always remind the people of Israel of what happened here." 
06Jos 4:8 The men followed Joshua's orders. As the LORD had commanded Joshua, they took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan, one for each of the tribes of Israel, carried them to the camping place, and put them down there. 
06Jos 4:9 Joshua also set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, where the priests carrying the Covenant Box had stood. (Those stones are still there.) 
06Jos 4:10 The priests stood in the middle of the Jordan until everything had been done that the LORD ordered Joshua to tell the people to do. This is what Moses had commanded. The people hurried across the river. 
06Jos 4:11 When they were all on the other side, the priests with the LORD's Covenant Box went on ahead of the people. 
06Jos 4:12 The men of the tribes of Reuben and Gad and of half the tribe of Manasseh, ready for battle, crossed ahead of the rest of the people, as Moses had told them to do. 
06Jos 4:13 In the presence of the LORD about forty thousand men ready for war crossed over to the plain near Jericho. 
06Jos 4:14 What the LORD did that day made the people of Israel consider Joshua a great man. They honored him all his life, just as they had honored Moses. 
06Jos 4:15 Then the LORD told Joshua 
06Jos 4:16 to command the priests carrying the Covenant Box to come up out of the Jordan. 
06Jos 4:17 Joshua did so, 
06Jos 4:18 and when the priests reached the riverbank, the river began flowing once more and flooded its banks again. 
06Jos 4:19 The people crossed the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal, east of Jericho. 
06Jos 4:20 There Joshua set up the twelve stones taken from the Jordan. 
06Jos 4:21 And he said to the people of Israel, "In the future, when your children ask you what these stones mean, 
06Jos 4:22 you will tell them about the time when Israel crossed the Jordan on dry ground. 
06Jos 4:23 Tell them that the LORD your God dried up the water of the Jordan for you until you had crossed, just as he dried up the Red Sea for us. 
06Jos 4:24 Because of this everyone on earth will know how great the LORD's power is, and you will honor the LORD your God forever." 
06Jos 5:1 All the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings along the Mediterranean Sea heard that the LORD had dried up the Jordan until the people of Israel had crossed it. They became afraid and lost their courage because of the Israelites. 
06Jos 5:2 Then the LORD told Joshua, "Make some knives out of flint and circumcise the Israelites." 
06Jos 5:3 So Joshua did as the LORD had commanded, and he circumcised the Israelites at a place called Circumcision Hill. 
06Jos 5:4 When the people of Israel left Egypt, all the males were already circumcised. However, during the forty years the people spent crossing the desert, none of the baby boys had been circumcised.
06Jos 5:5 Also, by the end of that time all the men who were of fighting age when they left Egypt had died because they had disobeyed the LORD. 
06Jos 5:6 Just as he had sworn, they were not allowed to see the rich and fertile land that he had promised their ancestors. 
06Jos 5:7 The sons of these men had never been circumcised, and it was this new generation that Joshua circumcised. 
06Jos 5:8 After the circumcision was completed, the whole nation stayed in the camp until the wounds had healed. 
06Jos 5:9 The LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have removed from you the disgrace of being slaves in Egypt." That is why the place was named Gilgal, the name it still has. 
06Jos 5:10 While the Israelites were camping at Gilgal on the plain near Jericho, they observed Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month. 
06Jos 5:11 The next day was the first time they ate food grown in Canaan: roasted grain and bread made without yeast. 
06Jos 5:12 The manna stopped falling then, and the Israelites no longer had any. From that time on they ate food grown in Canaan. 
06Jos 5:13 While Joshua was near Jericho, he suddenly saw a man standing in front of him, holding a sword. Joshua went up to him and asked, "Are you one of our soldiers, or an enemy?" 
06Jos 5:14 "Neither," the man answered. "I am here as the commander of the LORD's army." Joshua threw himself on the ground in worship and said, "I am your servant, sir. What do you want me to do?" 
06Jos 5:15 And the commander of the LORD's army told him, "Take your sandals off; you are standing on holy ground." And Joshua did as he was told. 
06Jos 6:1 The gates of Jericho were kept shut and guarded to keep the Israelites out. No one could enter or leave the city. 
06Jos 6:2 The LORD said to Joshua, "I am putting into your hands Jericho, with its king and all its brave soldiers. 
06Jos 6:3 You and your soldiers are to march around the city once a day for six days. 
06Jos 6:4 Seven priests, each carrying a trumpet, are to go in front of the Covenant Box. On the seventh day you and your soldiers are to march around the city seven times while the priests blow the trumpets. 
06Jos 6:5 Then they are to sound one long note. As soon as you hear it, all the people are to give a loud shout, and the city walls will collapse. Then the whole army will go straight into the city." 
06Jos 6:6 Joshua called the priests and told them, "Take the Covenant Box, and seven of you go in front of it, carrying trumpets." 
06Jos 6:7 Then he ordered the people to start marching around the city, with an advance guard going on ahead of the LORD's Covenant Box. 
06Jos 6:8 So, just as Joshua had ordered, an advance guard started out ahead of the priests who were blowing trumpets; behind these came the priests who were carrying the Covenant Box, followed by a rear guard. 
06Jos 6:9 All this time the trumpets were sounding.
06Jos 6:10 But Joshua had ordered the people not to shout, not to say a word until he gave the order. 
06Jos 6:11 So he had this group of men take the LORD's Covenant Box around the city one time. Then they came back to camp and spent the night there. 
06Jos 6:12 Joshua got up early the next morning, and for the second time the priests and soldiers marched around the city in the same order as the day before: 06Jos 6:13 first, the advance guard; next, the seven priests blowing the seven trumpets; then, the priests carrying the LORD's Covenant Box; and finally, the rear guard. All this time the trumpets were sounding. 
06Jos 6:14 On this second day they again marched around the city one time and then returned to camp. They did this for six days. 
06Jos 6:15 On the seventh day they got up at daybreak and marched seven times around the city in the same way - this was the only day that they marched around it seven times. 
06Jos 6:16 The seventh time around, when the priests were about to sound the trumpets, Joshua ordered the people to shout, and he said, "The LORD has given you the city! 
06Jos 6:17 The city and everything in it must be totally destroyed as an offering to the LORD. Only the prostitute Rahab and her household will be spared, because she hid our spies. 
06Jos 6:18 But you are not to take anything that is to be destroyed; if you do, you will bring trouble and destruction on the Israelite camp. 
06Jos 6:19 Everything made of silver, gold, bronze, or iron is set apart for the LORD. It is to be put in the LORD's treasury." 
06Jos 6:20 So the priests blew the trumpets. As soon as the people heard it, they gave a loud shout, and the walls collapsed. Then all the army went straight up the hill into the city and captured it. 
06Jos 6:21 With their swords they killed everyone in the city, men and women, young and old. They also killed the cattle, sheep, and donkeys. 
06Jos 6:22 Joshua then told the two men who had served as spies, "Go into the prostitute's house, and bring her and her family out, as you promised her." 
06Jos 6:23 So they went and brought Rahab out, along with her father and mother, her brothers, and the rest of her family. They took them all, family and slaves, to safety near the Israelite camp. 
06Jos 6:24 Then they set fire to the city and burned it to the ground, along with everything in it, except the things made of gold, silver, bronze, and iron, which they took and put in the LORD's treasury. 
06Jos 6:25 But Joshua spared the lives of the prostitute Rahab and all her relatives, because she had hidden the two spies that he had sent to Jericho. (Her descendants have lived in Israel to this day.) 
06Jos 6:26 At this time Joshua issued a solemn warning: "Anyone who tries to rebuild the city of Jericho will be under the LORD's curse. Whoever lays the foundation will lose his oldest son; Whoever builds the gates will lose his youngest." 
06Jos 6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame spread through the whole country. 
06Jos 7:1 The LORD's command to Israel not to take from Jericho anything that was to be destroyed was not obeyed. A man named Achan disobeyed that order, and so the LORD was furious with the Israelites. (Achan was the son of Carmi and grandson of Zabdi, and belonged to the clan of Zerah, a part of the tribe of Judah.) 
06Jos 7:2 Joshua sent some men from Jericho to Ai, a city east of Bethel, near Bethaven, with orders to go and explore the land. When they had done so, 
06Jos 7:3 they reported back to Joshua: "There is no need for everyone to attack Ai. Send only about two or three thousand men. Don't send the whole army up there to fight; it is not a large city." 
06Jos 7:4 So about three thousand Israelites made the attack, but they were forced to retreat. 
06Jos 7:5 The men of Ai chased them from the city gate as far as some quarries and killed about thirty-six of them on the way down the hill. Then the Israelites lost their courage and were afraid. 
06Jos 7:6 Joshua and the leaders of Israel tore their clothes in grief, threw themselves to the ground before the LORD's Covenant Box, and lay there till evening, with dust on their heads to show their sorrow. 
06Jos 7:7 And Joshua said, "Sovereign LORD! Why did you bring us across the Jordan at all? To turn us over to the Amorites? To destroy us? Why didn't we just stay on the other side of the Jordan? 
06Jos 7:8 What can I say, O Lord, now that Israel has retreated from the enemy? 
06Jos 7:9 The Canaanites and everyone else in the country will hear about it. They will surround us and kill every one of us! And then what will you do to protect your honor?" 
06Jos 7:10 The LORD said to Joshua, "Get up! Why are you lying on the ground like this? 
06Jos 7:11 Israel has sinned! They have broken the agreement with me that I ordered them to keep. They have taken some of the things condemned to destruction. They stole them, lied about it, and put them with their own things. 
06Jos 7:12 This is why the Israelites cannot stand against their enemies. They retreat from them because they themselves have now been condemned to destruction! I will not stay with you any longer unless you destroy the things you were ordered not to take! 
06Jos 7:13 Get up! Purify the people and get them ready to come before me. Tell them to be ready tomorrow, because I, the LORD God of Israel, have this to say: 'Israel, you have in your possession some things that I ordered you to destroy! You cannot stand against your enemies until you get rid of these things!' 
06Jos 7:14 So tell them that in the morning they will be brought forward, tribe by tribe. The tribe that I pick out will then come forward, clan by clan. The clan that I pick out will come forward, family by family. The family that I pick out will come forward, one by one. 
06Jos 7:15 The one who is then picked out and found with the condemned goods will be burned, along with his family and everything he owns, for he has brought terrible shame on Israel and has broken my covenant." 
06Jos 7:16 Early the next morning Joshua brought Israel forward, tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was picked out. 
06Jos 7:17 He brought the tribe of Judah forward, clan by clan, and the clan of Zerah was picked out. Then he brought the clan of Zerah forward, family by family, and the family of Zabdi was picked out. 
06Jos 7:18 He then brought Zabdi's family forward, one by one, and Achan, the son of Carmi and grandson of Zabdi, was picked out. 
06Jos 7:19 Joshua said to him, "My son, tell the truth here before the LORD, the God of Israel, and confess. Tell me now what you have done. Don't try to hide it from me." 
06Jos 7:20 "It's true," Achan answered. "I have sinned against the LORD, Israel's God, and this is what I did. 
06Jos 7:21 Among the things we seized I saw a beautiful Babylonian cloak, about five pounds of silver, and a bar of gold weighing over one pound. I wanted them so much that I took them. You will find them buried inside my tent, with the silver at the bottom." 
06Jos 7:22 So Joshua sent some men, who ran to the tent and found that the condemned things really were buried there, with the silver at the bottom. 
06Jos 7:23 They brought them out of the tent, took them to Joshua and all the Israelites, and laid them down in the presence of the LORD. 
06Jos 7:24 Joshua, along with all the people of Israel, seized Achan, the silver, the cloak, the bar of gold, together with Achan's sons and daughters, his cattle, donkeys, and sheep, his tent, and everything else he owned; and they took them to Trouble Valley. 
06Jos 7:25 And Joshua said, "Why have you brought such trouble on us? The LORD will now bring trouble on you!" All the people then stoned Achan to death; they also stoned and burned his family and possessions. 
06Jos 7:26 They put a huge pile of stones over him, which is there to this day. That is why that place is still called Trouble Valley. Then the LORD was no longer furious. 
06Jos 8:1 The LORD said to Joshua, "Take all the soldiers with you and go on up to Ai. Don't be afraid or discouraged. I will give you victory over the king of Ai; his people, city, and land will be yours. 
06Jos 8:2 You are to do to Ai and its king what you did to Jericho and its king, but this time you may keep its goods and livestock for yourselves. Prepare to attack the city by surprise from the rear." 
06Jos 8:3 So Joshua got ready to go to Ai with all his soldiers. He picked out thirty thousand of his best troops and sent them out at night 
06Jos 8:4 with these orders: "Hide on the other side of the city, but not too far away from it; be ready to attack. 
06Jos 8:5 My men and I will approach the city. When the men of Ai come out against us, we will turn and run, just as we did the first time. 
06Jos 8:6 They will pursue us until we have led them away from the city. They will think that we are running from them, as we did before. 
06Jos 8:7 Then you will come out of hiding and capture the city. The LORD your God will give it to you. 
06Jos 8:8 After you have taken the city, set it on fire, just as the LORD has commanded. These are your orders." 
06Jos 8:9 So Joshua sent them out, and they went to their hiding place and waited there, west of Ai, between Ai and Bethel. Joshua spent the night in camp. 
06Jos 8:10 Early in the morning Joshua got up and called the soldiers together. Then he and the leaders of Israel led them to Ai. 
06Jos 8:11 The soldiers with him went toward the main entrance to the city and set up camp on the north side, with a valley between themselves and Ai. 
06Jos 8:12 He took about five thousand men and put them in hiding west of the city, between Ai and Bethel. 
06Jos 8:13 The soldiers were arranged for battle with the main camp north of the city and the rest of the men to the west. Joshua spent the night in the valley. 
06Jos 8:14 When the king of Ai saw Joshua's men, he acted quickly. He and all his men went out toward the Jordan Valley to fight the Israelites at the same place as before, not knowing that he was about to be attacked from the rear. 
06Jos 8:15 Joshua and his men pretended that they were retreating, and ran away toward the barren country. 
06Jos 8:16 All the men in the city had been called together to go after them, and as they pursued Joshua, they kept getting farther away from the city. 
06Jos 8:17 Every man in Ai went after the Israelites, and the city was left wide open, with no one to defend it. 
06Jos 8:18 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Point your spear at Ai; I am giving it to you." Joshua did as he was told, 
06Jos 8:19 and as soon as he lifted his hand, the men who had been hiding got up quickly, ran into the city and captured it. They immediately set the city on fire. 
06Jos 8:20 When the men of Ai looked back, they saw the smoke rising to the sky. There was no way for them to escape, because the Israelites who had run toward the barren country now turned around to attack them. 
06Jos 8:21 When Joshua and his men saw that the others had taken the city and that it was on fire, they turned around and began killing the men of Ai. 
06Jos 8:22 The Israelites in the city now came down to join the battle. So the men of Ai found themselves completely surrounded by Israelites, and they were all killed. No one got away, and no one lived through it 
06Jos 8:23 except the king of Ai. He was captured and taken to Joshua. 
06Jos 8:24 The Israelites killed every one of the enemy in the barren country where they had chased them. Then they went back to Ai and killed everyone there. 
06Jos 8:25 Joshua kept his spear pointed at Ai and did not put it down until every person there had been killed. 
06Jos 8:26 The whole population of Ai was killed that day - twelve thousand men and women. 
06Jos 8:27 The Israelites kept for themselves the livestock and goods captured in the city, as the LORD had told Joshua. 
06Jos 8:28 Joshua burned Ai and left it in ruins. It is still like that today. 
06Jos 8:29 He hanged the king of Ai from a tree and left his body there until evening. At sundown Joshua gave orders for the body to be removed, and it was thrown down at the entrance to the city gate. They covered it with a huge pile of stones, which is still there today. 
06Jos 8:30 Then Joshua built on Mount Ebal an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel. 
06Jos 8:31 He made it according to the instructions that Moses, the LORD's servant, had given the Israelites, as it says in the Law of Moses: "an altar made of stones which have not been cut with iron tools." On it they offered burnt sacrifices to the LORD, and they also presented their fellowship offerings. 
06Jos 8:32 There, with the Israelites looking on, Joshua made on the stones a copy of the Law which Moses had written. 
06Jos 8:33 The Israelites, with their leaders, officers, and judges, as well as the foreigners among them, stood on two sides of the LORD's Covenant Box, facing the levitical priests who carried it. Half of the people stood with their backs to Mount Gerizim and the other half with their backs to Mount Ebal. The LORD's servant Moses had commanded them to do this when the time came for them to receive the blessing. 
06Jos 8:34 Joshua then read aloud the whole Law, including the blessings and the curses, just as they are written in the book of the Law. 
06Jos 8:35 Every one of the commandments of Moses was read by Joshua to the whole gathering, which included women and children, as well as the foreigners living among them. 
06Jos 9:1 The victories of Israel became known to all the kings west of the Jordan - in the hills, in the foothills, and all along the coastal plain of the Mediterranean Sea as far north as Lebanon; these were the kings of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
06Jos 9:2 They all came together and joined forces to fight against Joshua and the Israelites. 
06Jos 9:3 But the people of Gibeon, who were Hivites, heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 
06Jos 9:4 and they decided to deceive him. They went and got some food and loaded their donkeys with worn-out sacks and patched-up wineskins. 
06Jos 9:5 They put on ragged clothes and worn-out sandals that had been mended. The bread they took with them was dry and moldy. 
06Jos 9:6 Then they went to the camp at Gilgal and said to Joshua and the Israelites, "We have come from a distant land. We want you to make a treaty with us." 
06Jos 9:7 But the Israelites said, "Why should we make a treaty with you? Maybe you live nearby." 
06Jos 9:8 They said to Joshua, "We are at your service." Joshua asked them, "Who are you? Where do you come from?" 
06Jos 9:9 Then they told him this story: "We have come from a very distant land, sir, because we have heard of the LORD your God. We have heard about everything that he did in Egypt 
06Jos 9:10 and what he did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan: King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth. 
06Jos 9:11 Our leaders and all the people that live in our land told us to get some food ready for a trip and to go and meet you. We were told to put ourselves at your service and ask you to make a treaty with us. 
06Jos 9:12 Look at our bread. When we left home with it and started out to meet you, it was still warm. But look! Now it is dry and moldy. 
06Jos 9:13 When we filled these wineskins, they were new, but look! They are torn. Our clothes and sandals are worn out from the long trip." 
06Jos 9:14 The Israelites accepted some food from them, but did not consult the LORD about it. 
06Jos 9:15 Joshua made a treaty of friendship with the people of Gibeon and allowed them to live. The leaders of the community of Israel gave their solemn promise to keep the treaty. 
06Jos 9:16 Three days after the treaty had been made, the Israelites learned that these people did indeed live nearby. 
06Jos 9:17 So the people of Israel started out and three days later arrived at the cities where these people lived: Gibeon, Chephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath Jearim. 
06Jos 9:18 But the Israelites could not kill them, because their leaders had made a solemn promise to them in the name of the LORD, Israel's God. All the people complained to the leaders about this, 
06Jos 9:19 but they answered, "We have made our solemn promise to them in the name of the LORD God of Israel. Now we cannot harm them. 
06Jos 9:20 We must let them live because of our promise; if we don't, God will punish us. 
06Jos 9:21 Let them live, but they will have to cut wood and carry water for us." This was what the leaders suggested. 
06Jos 9:22 Joshua ordered the people of Gibeon to be brought to him, and he asked them, "Why did you deceive us and tell us that you were from far away, when you live right here? 
06Jos 9:23 Because you did this, God has condemned you. Your people will always be slaves, cutting wood and carrying water for the sanctuary of my God." 
06Jos 9:24 They answered, "We did it, sir, because we learned that it was really true that the LORD your God had commanded his servant Moses to give you the whole land and to kill the people living in it as you advanced. We did it because we were terrified of you; we were in fear of our lives. 
06Jos 9:25 Now we are in your power; do with us what you think is right." 
06Jos 9:26 So this is what Joshua did: he protected them and did not allow the people of Israel to kill them. 
06Jos 9:27 But at the same time he made them slaves, to cut wood and carry water for the people of Israel and for the LORD's altar. To this day they have continued to do this work in the place where the LORD has chosen to be worshiped. 
06Jos 10:1 Adonizedek, the king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had captured and totally destroyed Ai and had killed its king, just as he had done to Jericho and its king. He also heard that the people of Gibeon had made peace with the Israelites and were living among them. 
06Jos 10:2 The people of Jerusalem were greatly alarmed at this because Gibeon was as large as any of the cities that had a king; it was larger than Ai, and its men were good fighters. 
06Jos 10:3 So Adonizedek sent the following message to King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and to King Debir of Eglon�� 06Jos 10:4 "Come and help me attack Gibeon, because its people have made peace with Joshua and the Israelites." 
06Jos 10:5 These five Amorite kings, the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon, joined forces, surrounded Gibeon, and attacked it. 
06Jos 10:6 The men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal: "Do not abandon us, sir! Come at once and help us! Save us! All the Amorite kings in the hill country have joined forces and have attacked us!" 
06Jos 10:7 So Joshua and his whole army, including the best troops, started out from Gilgal. 
06Jos 10:8 The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them. I have already given you the victory. Not one of them will be able to stand against you." 
06Jos 10:9 All night Joshua and his army marched from Gilgal to Gibeon, and they made a surprise attack on the Amorites. 
06Jos 10:10 The LORD made the Amorites panic at the sight of Israel's army. The Israelites slaughtered them at Gibeon and pursued them down the mountain pass at Beth Horon, keeping up the attack as far south as Azekah and Makkedah. 
06Jos 10:11 While the Amorites were running down the pass from the Israelite army, the LORD made large hailstones fall down on them all the way to Azekah. More were killed by the hailstones than by the Israelites. 
06Jos 10:12 On the day that the LORD gave the men of Israel victory over the Amorites, Joshua spoke to the LORD. In the presence of the Israelites he said, "Sun, stand still over Gibeon; Moon, stop over Aijalon Valley." 
06Jos 10:13 The sun stood still and the moon did not move until the nation had conquered its enemies. This is written in The Book of Jashar. The sun stood still in the middle of the sky and did not go down for a whole day. 
06Jos 10:14 Never before, and never since, has there been a day like it, when the LORD obeyed a human being. The LORD fought on Israel's side! 
06Jos 10:15 After this, Joshua and his army went back to the camp at Gilgal. 
06Jos 10:16 The five Amorite kings, however, had escaped and were hiding in the cave at Makkedah. 
06Jos 10:17 Someone found them, and Joshua was told where they were hiding. 
06Jos 10:18 He said, "Roll some big stones in front of the entrance to the cave. Place some guards there, 
06Jos 10:19 but don't stay there yourselves. Keep on after the enemy and attack them from the rear; don't let them get to their cities! The LORD your God has given you victory over them." 
06Jos 10:20 Joshua and the men of Israel slaughtered them, although some managed to find safety inside their city walls and were not killed. 
06Jos 10:21 Then all of Joshua's men came back safe to him at the camp at Makkedah. No one in the land dared even to speak against the Israelites. 
06Jos 10:22 Then Joshua said, "Open the entrance to the cave and bring those five kings out to me." 
06Jos 10:23 So the cave was opened, and the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon were brought out 
06Jos 10:24 and taken to Joshua. Joshua then called all the men of Israel to him and ordered the officers who had gone with him to come and put their feet on the necks of the kings. They did so. 
06Jos 10:25 Then Joshua said to his officers, "Don't be afraid or discouraged. Be determined and confident because this is what the LORD is going to do to all your enemies." 
06Jos 10:26 Then Joshua killed the kings and hanged them on five trees, where their bodies stayed until evening. 
06Jos 10:27 At sundown Joshua gave orders, and their bodies were taken down and thrown into the same cave where they had hidden earlier. Large stones were placed at the entrance to the cave, and they are still there. 
06Jos 10:28 Joshua attacked and captured Makkedah and its king that day. He put everyone in the city to death; no one was left alive. He did to the king of Makkedah what he had done to the king of Jericho. 
06Jos 10:29 After this, Joshua and his army went on from Makkedah to Libnah and attacked it. 
06Jos 10:30 The LORD also gave the Israelites victory over this city and its king. They spared no one, but killed every person in it. They did to the king what they had done to the king of Jericho. 
06Jos 10:31 After this, Joshua and his army went on from Libnah to Lachish, surrounded it and attacked it. 
06Jos 10:32 The LORD gave the Israelites victory over Lachish on the second day of the battle. Just as they had done at Libnah, they spared no one, but killed every person in the city. 
06Jos 10:33 King Horam of Gezer came to the aid of Lachish, but Joshua defeated him and his army and left none of them alive. 
06Jos 10:34 Next, Joshua and his army went on from Lachish to Eglon, surrounded it and attacked it. 
06Jos 10:35 They captured it the same day and put everyone there to death, just as they had done at Lachish. 
06Jos 10:36 After this, Joshua and his army went from Eglon up into the hills to Hebron, attacked it 
06Jos 10:37 and captured it. They killed the king and everyone else in the city as well as in the nearby towns. Joshua condemned the city to total destruction, just as he had done to Eglon. No one in it was left alive. 
06Jos 10:38 Then Joshua and his army turned back to Debir and attacked it. 
06Jos 10:39 He captured it, with its king and all the nearby towns. They put everyone there to death. Joshua did to Debir and its king what he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king. 
06Jos 10:40 Joshua conquered the whole land. He defeated the kings of the hill country, the eastern slopes, and the western foothills, as well as those of the dry country in the south. He spared no one; everyone was put to death. This was what the LORD God of Israel had commanded. 
06Jos 10:41 Joshua's campaign took him from Kadesh Barnea in the south to Gaza near the coast, including all the area of Goshen, and as far north as Gibeon. 
06Jos 10:42 Joshua conquered all these kings and their territory in one campaign because the LORD, Israel's God, was fighting for Israel. 
06Jos 10:43 After this, Joshua and his army went back to the camp at Gilgal. 
06Jos 11:1 When the news of Israel's victories reached King Jabin of Hazor, he sent word to King Jobab of Madon, to the kings of Shimron and Achshaph, 
06Jos 11:2 and to the kings in the hill country in the north, in the Jordan Valley south of Lake Galilee, in the foothills, and on the coast near Dor. 
06Jos 11:3 He also sent word to the Canaanites on both sides of the Jordan, to the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, and the Jebusites in the hill country, as well as to the Hivites who lived at the foot of Mount Hermon in the land of Mizpah. 
06Jos 11:4 They came with all their soldiers - an army with as many men as there are grains of sand on the seashore. They also had many horses and chariots. 
06Jos 11:5 All of these kings joined forces and came together and set up camp at Merom Brook to fight against Israel. 
06Jos 11:6 The LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them. By this time tomorrow I will have killed all of them for Israel. You are to cripple their horses and burn their chariots." 
06Jos 11:7 So Joshua and all his men attacked them by surprise at Merom Brook. 
06Jos 11:8 The LORD gave the Israelites victory over them; the Israelites attacked and pursued them as far north as Misrephoth Maim and Sidon, and as far east as the valley of Mizpah. The fight continued until none of the enemy was left alive. 
06Jos 11:9 Joshua did to them what the LORD had commanded: he crippled their horses and burned their chariots. 
06Jos 11:10 Joshua then turned back, captured Hazor and killed its king. (At that time Hazor was the most powerful of all those kingdoms.) 
06Jos 11:11 They put everyone there to death; no one was left alive, and the city was burned. 
06Jos 11:12 Joshua captured all these cities and their kings, putting everyone to death, just as Moses, the LORD's servant, had commanded. 
06Jos 11:13 However, the Israelites did not burn any of the cities built on mounds, except Hazor, which Joshua did burn. 
06Jos 11:14 The people of Israel took all the valuables and livestock from these cities and kept them for themselves. But they put every person to death; no one was left alive. 
06Jos 11:15 The LORD had given his commands to his servant Moses, Moses had given them to Joshua, and Joshua obeyed them. He did everything that the LORD had commanded Moses. 
06Jos 11:16 Joshua captured all the land - the hill country and foothills, both north and south, all the area of Goshen and the dry country south of it, as well as the Jordan Valley. 
06Jos 11:17 The territory extended from Mount Halak in the south near Edom, as far as Baalgad in the north, in the valley of Lebanon south of Mount Hermon. 
06Jos 11:18 Joshua was at war with the kings of this territory for a long time, but he captured them all and put them to death. 
06Jos 11:19 The only city that made peace with the people of Israel was Gibeon, where some of the Hivites lived. All the others were conquered in battle. 
06Jos 11:20 The LORD had made them determined to fight the Israelites, so that they would be condemned to total destruction and all be killed without mercy. This was what the LORD had commanded Moses. 
06Jos 11:21 At this time Joshua went and destroyed the race of giants called the Anakim who lived in the hill country - in Hebron, Debir, Anab, and in all the hill country of Judah and Israel. Joshua completely destroyed them and their cities. 
06Jos 11:22 None of the Anakim were left in the land of Israel; a few, however, were left in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod. 
06Jos 11:23 Joshua captured the whole land, as the LORD had commanded Moses. Joshua gave it to the Israelites as their own and divided it into portions, one for each tribe. So the people rested from war. 
06Jos 12:1 The people of Israel had already conquered and occupied the land east of the Jordan, from the Arnon Valley up the Jordan Valley and as far north as Mount Hermon. They defeated two kings. 
06Jos 12:2 One was Sihon, the Amorite king who ruled at Heshbon. His kingdom included half of Gilead: from Aroer (on the edge of the Arnon Valley) and from the city in the middle of that valley, as far as the Jabbok River, the border of Ammon; 
06Jos 12:3 it included the Jordan Valley from Lake Galilee south to Beth Jeshimoth (east of the Dead Sea) and on toward the foot of Mount Pisgah. 
06Jos 12:4 They also defeated King Og of Bashan, who was one of the last of the Rephaim; he ruled at Ashtaroth and Edrei. 
06Jos 12:5 His kingdom included Mount Hermon, Salecah, and all of Bashan as far as the boundaries of Geshur and Maacah, as well as half of Gilead, as far as the territory of King Sihon of Heshbon. 
06Jos 12:6 These two kings were defeated by Moses and the people of Israel. Moses, the LORD's servant, gave their land to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and to half the tribe of Manasseh, to be their possession. 
06Jos 12:7 Joshua and the people of Israel defeated all the kings in the territory west of the Jordan, from Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak in the south near Edom. Joshua divided this land among the tribes and gave it to them as a permanent possession. 
06Jos 12:8 This portion included the hill country, the western foothills, the Jordan Valley and its foothills, the eastern slopes, and the dry country in the south. This land had been the home of the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
06Jos 12:9 The people of Israel defeated the kings of the following cities: Jericho, Ai (near Bethel), 
06Jos 12:10 Jerusalem, Hebron, 
06Jos 12:11 Jarmuth, Lachish, 
06Jos 12:12 Eglon, Gezer, 
06Jos 12:13 Debir, Geder, 
06Jos 12:14 Hormah, Arad, 
06Jos 12:15 Libnah, Adullam, 
06Jos 12:16 Makkedah, Bethel, 
06Jos 12:17 Tappuah, Hepher, 
06Jos 12:18 Aphek, Lasharon, 
06Jos 12:19 Madon, Hazor, 
06Jos 12:20 Shimron Meron, Achshaph, 
06Jos 12:21 Taanach, Megiddo, 
06Jos 12:22 Kedesh, Jokneam (in Carmel), 
06Jos 12:23 Dor (on the coast), Goiim (in Galilee ), 
06Jos 12:24 and Tirzah - thirty-one kings in all. 
06Jos 13:1 Joshua was now very old. The LORD said to him, "You are very old, but there is still much land to be taken�� 06Jos 13:2 all the territory of Philistia and Geshur, 
06Jos 13:3 as well as all the territory of the Avvim to the south. (The land from the stream Shihor, at the Egyptian border, as far north as the border of Ekron was considered Canaanite; the kings of the Philistines lived at Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.) 
06Jos 13:4 There is still all the Canaanite country, and Mearah (which belonged to the Sidonians), as far as Aphek, at the Amorite border; 
06Jos 13:5 the land of the Gebalites; all of Lebanon to the east, from Baalgad, which is south of Mount Hermon, to Hamath Pass. 
06Jos 13:6 This includes all the territory of the Sidonians, who live in the hill country between the Lebanon Mountains and Misrephoth Maim. I will drive all these peoples out as the people of Israel advance. You must divide the land among the Israelites, just as I have commanded you to do. 
06Jos 13:7 Now then, divide this land among the other nine tribes and half of the tribe of Manasseh, for them to possess as their own." 
06Jos 13:8 The tribes of Reuben and Gad and the other half of the tribe of Manasseh had already received the land that Moses, the LORD's servant, had given them; it was on the east side of the Jordan River. 
06Jos 13:9 Their territory extended to Aroer (on the edge of the Arnon Valley) and the city in the middle of that valley and included all of the plateau from Medeba to Dibon. 
06Jos 13:10 It went as far as the border of Ammon and included all the cities that had been ruled by the Amorite king Sihon, who had ruled at Heshbon. 
06Jos 13:11 It included Gilead, the regions of Geshur and Maacah, all of Mount Hermon, and all of Bashan as far as Salecah. 
06Jos 13:12 It included the kingdom of Og, the last of the Rephaim, who had ruled at Ashtaroth and Edrei. Moses had defeated these people and driven them out. 
06Jos 13:13 However, the Israelites did not drive out the people of Geshur and Maacah; they still live in Israel. 
06Jos 13:14 Moses had given no land to the tribe of Levi. As the LORD had told Moses, they were to receive as their possession a share of the sacrifices burned on the altar to the LORD God of Israel. 
06Jos 13:15 Moses had given a part of the land to the families of the tribe of Reuben as their possession. 
06Jos 13:16 Their territory extended to Aroer (on the edge of the Arnon Valley) and the city in the middle of that valley and included all the plateau around Medeba. 
06Jos 13:17 It included Heshbon and all the cities on the plateau: Dibon, Bamoth Baal, Beth Baalmeon, 
06Jos 13:18 Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
06Jos 13:19 Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth Shahar on the hill in the valley, 
06Jos 13:20 Bethpeor, the slopes of Mount Pisgah, and Beth Jeshimoth. 
06Jos 13:21 It included all the cities of the plateau and the whole kingdom of the Amorite king Sihon, who had ruled at Heshbon. Moses defeated him, as well as the rulers of Midian: Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. All of them had ruled the land for King Sihon. 
06Jos 13:22 Among those whom the people of Israel killed was the fortune teller Balaam son of Beor. 
06Jos 13:23 The Jordan was the western border of the tribe of Reuben. These were the cities and towns given to the families of the tribe of Reuben as their possession. 
06Jos 13:24 Moses had also given a part of the land to the families of the tribe of Gad as their possession. 
06Jos 13:25 Their territory included Jazer and all the cities of Gilead, half the land of Ammon as far as Aroer, which is east of Rabbah; 
06Jos 13:26 their land extended from Heshbon to Ramath Mizpeh and Betonim, from Mahanaim to the border of Lodebar. 
06Jos 13:27 In the Jordan Valley it included Beth Haram, Bethnimrah, Sukkoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of King Sihon of Heshbon. Their western border was the Jordan River as far north as Lake Galilee. 
06Jos 13:28 These were the cities and towns given to the families of the tribe of Gad as their possession. 
06Jos 13:29 Moses had given a part of the land to the families of half the tribe of Manasseh as their possession. 
06Jos 13:30 Their territory extended to Mahanaim and included all of Bashan - the whole kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, as well as all sixty of the villages of Jair in Bashan. 
06Jos 13:31 It included half of Gilead, as well as Ashtaroth and Edrei, the capital cities of Og's kingdom in Bashan. All this was given to half the families descended from Machir son of Manasseh. 
06Jos 13:32 This is how Moses divided the land east of Jericho and the Jordan when he was in the plains of Moab. 
06Jos 13:33 But Moses did not assign any land to the tribe of Levi. He told them that their possession was to be a share of the offerings to the LORD God of Israel. 
06Jos 14:1 What follows is an account of how the land of Canaan west of the Jordan was divided among the people of Israel. Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of the families of the Israelite tribes divided it among the population. 
06Jos 14:2 As the LORD had commanded Moses, the territories of the nine and one-half tribes west of the Jordan were determined by drawing lots. 
06Jos 14:3 Moses had already assigned the land east of the Jordan to the other two and one-half tribes. (The descendants of Joseph were divided into two tribes: Manasseh and Ephraim.) However, Moses gave the Levites no portion of the territory. 
06Jos 14:4 Instead, they received cities to live in, with fields for their cattle and flocks. 
06Jos 14:5 The people of Israel divided the land as the LORD had commanded Moses. 
06Jos 14:6 One day some people from the tribe of Judah came to Joshua at Gilgal. One of them, Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, said to him, "You know what the LORD said in Kadesh Barnea about you and me to Moses, the man of God. 
06Jos 14:7 I was forty years old when the LORD's servant Moses sent me from Kadesh Barnea to spy out this land. I brought an honest report back to him. 
06Jos 14:8 The men who went with me, however, made our people afraid. But I faithfully obeyed the LORD my God. 
06Jos 14:9 Because I did, Moses promised me that my children and I would certainly receive as our possession the land which I walked over. 
06Jos 14:10 But now, look. It has been forty-five years since the LORD said that to Moses. That was when Israel was going through the desert, and the LORD, as he promised, has kept me alive ever since. Look at me! I am eighty-five years old 
06Jos 14:11 and am just as strong today as I was when Moses sent me out. I am still strong enough for war or for anything else. 
06Jos 14:12 Now then, give me the hill country that the LORD promised me on that day when my men and I reported. We told you then that the race of giants called the Anakim were there in large walled cities. Maybe the LORD will be with me, and I will drive them out, just as the LORD said." 
06Jos 14:13 Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave him the city of Hebron as his possession. 
06Jos 14:14 Hebron still belongs to the descendants of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, because he faithfully obeyed the LORD, the God of Israel. 
06Jos 14:15 Before this, Hebron was called the city of Arba. (Arba had been the greatest of the Anakim.) There was now peace in the land. 
06Jos 15:1 The families of the tribe of Judah received a part of the land described as follows: The land reached south to the southernmost point of the wilderness of Zin, at the border of Edom. 
06Jos 15:2 This southern border ran from the south end of the Dead Sea, 
06Jos 15:3 went southward from the Akrabbim Pass and on to Zin. It ran south of Kadesh Barnea, past Hezron and up to Addar, turned toward Karka, 
06Jos 15:4 went on to Azmon, and followed the stream on the border of Egypt to the Mediterranean Sea, where the border ended. That was the southern border of Judah. 
06Jos 15:5 The eastern border was the Dead Sea, all the way up to the inlet where the Jordan empties into it. The northern border began there, 
06Jos 15:6 extended up to Beth Hoglah, and went north of the ridge overlooking the Jordan Valley. Then it went up to the Stone of Bohan (Bohan was a son of Reuben), 
06Jos 15:7 from Trouble Valley up to Debir, and then turned north toward Gilgal, which faces Adummim Pass on the south side of the valley. It then went on to the springs of Enshemesh, out to Enrogel, 
06Jos 15:8 and up through Hinnom Valley on the south side of the hill where the Jebusite city of Jerusalem was located. The border then proceeded up to the top of the hill on the west side of Hinnom Valley, at the northern end of Rephaim Valley. 
06Jos 15:9 From there it went to the Springs of Nephtoah and out to the cities near Mount Ephron. There it turned toward Baalah (or Kiriath Jearim), 
06Jos 15:10 where it circled west of Baalah toward the hill country of Edom, went on the north side of Mount Jearim (or Chesalon), down to Beth Shemesh, and on past Timnah. 
06Jos 15:11 The border then went out to the hill north of Ekron, turned toward Shikkeron, past Mount Baalah, and on to Jamnia. It ended at the Mediterranean Sea, 
06Jos 15:12 which formed the western border. Within these borders lived the people of the families of Judah. 
06Jos 15:13 As the LORD commanded Joshua, part of the territory of Judah was given to Caleb son of Jephunneh, from the tribe of Judah. He received Hebron, the city belonging to Arba, father of Anak. 
06Jos 15:14 Caleb drove the descendants of Anak out of the city - the clans of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. 
06Jos 15:15 From there he went to attack the people living in Debir. (This city used to be called Kiriath Sepher.) 
06Jos 15:16 Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage to the man who succeeds in capturing Kiriath Sepher." 
06Jos 15:17 Othniel, the son of Caleb's brother Kenaz, captured the city, so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah in marriage. 
06Jos 15:18 On the wedding day Othniel urged her to ask her father for a field. She got down from her donkey, and Caleb asked her what she wanted. 
06Jos 15:19 She answered, "I want some water holes. The land you have given me is in the dry country." So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs. 
06Jos 15:20 This is the land that the families of the tribe of Judah received as their possession. 
06Jos 15:21 The cities farthest south that belonged to them, those that were near the border of Edom, were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, 
06Jos 15:22 Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, 
06Jos 15:23 Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan, 
06Jos 15:24 Ziph, Telem, Bealoth, 
06Jos 15:25 Hazor Hadattah, Kerioth Hezron (or Hazor), 
06Jos 15:26 Amam, Shema, Moladah, 
06Jos 15:27 Hazar Gaddah, Heshmon, Bethpelet, 
06Jos 15:28 Hazar Shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah, 
06Jos 15:29 Baalah, Iim, Ezem, 
06Jos 15:30 Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah, 
06Jos 15:31 Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah, 
06Jos 15:32 Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon: twenty-nine cities in all, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 15:33 The cities in the foothills were Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, 
06Jos 15:34 Zanoah, Engannim, Tappuah, Enam, 
06Jos 15:35 Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah, 
06Jos 15:36 Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim: fourteen cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 15:37 There were also Zenan, Hadashah, Migdalgad, 
06Jos 15:38 Dilean, Mizpah, Joktheel, 
06Jos 15:39 Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon, 
06Jos 15:40 Cabbon, Lahmam, Chitlish, 
06Jos 15:41 Gederoth, Bethdagon, Naamah, and Makkedah: sixteen cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 15:42 There were also Libnah, Ether, Ashan, 
06Jos 15:43 Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, 
06Jos 15:44 Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah: nine cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 15:45 There was Ekron with its towns and villages, 
06Jos 15:46 and all the cities and towns near Ashdod, from Ekron to the Mediterranean Sea. 
06Jos 15:47 There were Ashdod and Gaza, with their towns and villages, reaching to the stream on the border of Egypt and the coast of the Mediterranean Sea. 
06Jos 15:48 In the hill country there were Shamir, Jattir, Socoh, 
06Jos 15:49 Dannah, Kiriath Sepher (or Debir), 
06Jos 15:50 Anab, Eshtemoa, Anim, 
06Jos 15:51 Goshen, Holon, and Giloh: eleven cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 15:52 There were Arab, Dumah, Eshan, 
06Jos 15:53 Janim, Beth Tappuah, Aphekah, 
06Jos 15:54 Humtah, Hebron, and Zior: nine cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 15:55 There were Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah, 
06Jos 15:56 Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, 
06Jos 15:57 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah: ten cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 15:58 There were Halhul, Bethzur, Gedor, 
06Jos 15:59 Maarath, Bethanoth, and Eltekon: six cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 15:60 There were Kiriath Baal (or Kiriath Jearim) and Rabbah: two cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 15:61 In the desert there were Beth Arabah, Middin, Secacah, 
06Jos 15:62 Nibshan, Salt City, and Engedi: six cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 15:63 But the people of Judah were not able to drive out the Jebusites, who lived in Jerusalem. The Jebusites still live there with the people of Judah. 
06Jos 16:1 The southern boundary of the land assigned to the descendants of Joseph started from the Jordan near Jericho, at a point east of the springs of Jericho, and went into the desert. It went from Jericho up into the hill country as far as Bethel. 
06Jos 16:2 From Bethel it went to Luz, passing on to Ataroth Addar, where the Archites lived. 
06Jos 16:3 It then went west to the area of the Japhletites, as far as the area of Lower Beth Horon. It went on from there to Gezer and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. 
06Jos 16:4 The descendants of Joseph, the tribes of Ephraim and West Manasseh, received this land as their possession. 
06Jos 16:5 This was the territory of the Ephraimite families: their border ran from Ataroth Addar eastward to Upper Beth Horon, 
06Jos 16:6 and from there to the Mediterranean Sea. Michmethath was on their north. East of there the border bent toward Taanath Shiloh and went past it on the east to Janoah. 
06Jos 16:7 Then it went down from Janoah to Ataroth and Naarah, reaching Jericho and ending at the Jordan. 
06Jos 16:8 The border went west from Tappuah to the stream Kanah and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. This was the land given to the families of the tribe of Ephraim as their possession, 
06Jos 16:9 along with some towns and villages that were within the borders of Manasseh, but given to the Ephraimites. 
06Jos 16:10 But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites have lived among the Ephraimites to this day, but they have been forced to work as slaves. 
06Jos 17:1 A part of the land west of the Jordan was assigned to some of the families descended from Joseph's older son Manasseh. Machir, the father of Gilead, was Manasseh's oldest son and a military hero, so Gilead and Bashan, east of the Jordan, were assigned to him. 
06Jos 17:2 Land west of the Jordan was assigned to the rest of the families of Manasseh: Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These were male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph, and they were heads of families. 
06Jos 17:3 Zelophehad, son of Hepher, son of Gilead, son of Machir, son of Manasseh, did not have any sons, but only daughters. Their names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
06Jos 17:4 They went to Eleazar the priest and to Joshua son of Nun and to the leaders, and said, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us, as well as our male relatives, a part of the land to possess." So, as the LORD had commanded, they were given land along with their male relatives. 
06Jos 17:5 This is why Manasseh received ten shares in addition to Gilead and Bashan on the east side of the Jordan, 
06Jos 17:6 since his female descendants as well as his male descendants were assigned land. The land of Gilead was assigned to the rest of the descendants of Manasseh. 
06Jos 17:7 The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Michmethath, east of Shechem. The border then went south to include the people of Entappuah. 
06Jos 17:8 The land around Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah, on the border, belonged to the descendants of Ephraim. 
06Jos 17:9 The border then went down to the stream Kanah. The cities south of the stream belonged to Ephraim, even though they were in the territory of Manasseh. The border of Manasseh proceeded along the north side of the stream and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. 
06Jos 17:10 Ephraim was to the south, and Manasseh was to the north, with the Mediterranean Sea as their western border. Asher was to the northwest, and Issachar to the northeast. 
06Jos 17:11 Within the territories of Issachar and Asher, Manasseh possessed Beth Shan and Ibleam, along with their surrounding towns, as well as Dor (the one on the coast), Endor, Taanach, Megiddo, and their surrounding towns. 
06Jos 17:12 The people of Manasseh, however, were not able to drive out the people living in those cities, so the Canaanites continued to live there. 
06Jos 17:13 Even when the Israelites became stronger, they did not drive out all the Canaanites, but they did force them to work for them. 
06Jos 17:14 The descendants of Joseph said to Joshua, "Why have you given us only one part of the land to possess as our own? There are very many of us because the LORD has blessed us." 
06Jos 17:15 Joshua answered, "If there are so many of you and the hill country of Ephraim is too small for you, then go into the forests and clear ground for yourselves in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim." 
06Jos 17:16 They replied, "The hill country is not big enough for us, but the Canaanites in the plains have iron chariots, both those who live in Beth Shan and its surrounding towns and those who live in Jezreel Valley." 
06Jos 17:17 Joshua said to the tribes of Ephraim and West Manasseh, "There are indeed many of you, and you are very powerful. You shall have more than one share. 
06Jos 17:18 The hill country will be yours. Even though it is a forest, you will clear it and take possession of it from one end to the other. As for the Canaanites, you will drive them out, even though they do have iron chariots and are a strong people." 
06Jos 18:1 After they had conquered the land, the entire community of Israel assembled at Shiloh and set up the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
06Jos 18:2 There were still seven tribes of the people of Israel who had not yet been assigned their share of the land. 
06Jos 18:3 So Joshua said to the people of Israel, "How long are you going to wait before you go in and take the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has given you? 
06Jos 18:4 Let me have three men from each tribe. I will send them out over the whole country to map out the territory that they would like to have as their possession. Then they are to come back to me. 
06Jos 18:5 The land will be divided among them in seven parts; Judah will stay in its territory in the south, and Joseph in its territory in the north. 
06Jos 18:6 Write down a description of these seven divisions and bring it to me. Then I will draw lots to consult the LORD our God for you. 
06Jos 18:7 The Levites, however, will not receive a share of the land with the rest of you, because their share is to serve as the LORD's priests. And of course, the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and East Manasseh have already received their land east of the Jordan, which Moses, the LORD's servant, gave to them." 
06Jos 18:8 The men went on their way to map out the land after Joshua had given them these instructions: "Go all over the land and map it out, and come back to me. And then here in Shiloh I will consult the LORD for you by drawing lots." 
06Jos 18:9 So the men went all over the land and set down in writing how they divided it into seven parts, making a list of the towns. Then they went back to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh. 
06Jos 18:10 Joshua drew lots to consult the LORD for them, and assigned each of the remaining tribes of Israel a certain part of the land. 
06Jos 18:11 The territory belonging to the families of the tribe of Benjamin was the first to be assigned. Their land lay between the tribes of Judah and Joseph. 
06Jos 18:12 On the north their border began at the Jordan and then went up the slope north of Jericho and westward through the hill country as far as the desert of Bethaven. 
06Jos 18:13 The border then went to the slope on the south side of Luz (also called Bethel), then down to Ataroth Addar, on the mountain south of Lower Beth Horon. 
06Jos 18:14 The border then went in another direction, turning south from the western side of this mountain and going to Kiriath Baal (or Kiriath Jearim), which belongs to the tribe of Judah. This was the western border. 
06Jos 18:15 The southern border started on the edge of Kiriath Jearim and went to the Springs of Nephtoah. 
06Jos 18:16 It then went down to the foot of the mountain that overlooks Hinnom Valley, at the north end of Rephaim Valley. It then went south through Hinnom Valley, south of the Jebusite ridge, toward Enrogel. 
06Jos 18:17 It then turned north to Enshemesh and then on to Geliloth, opposite Adummim Pass. The border then went down to the Stone of Bohan (Bohan was a son of Reuben) 
06Jos 18:18 and passed north of the ridge overlooking the Jordan Valley. It then went down into the valley, 
06Jos 18:19 passing north of the ridge of Beth Hoglah, and ended at the northern inlet on the Dead Sea, where the Jordan River empties into it. This was the southern border. 
06Jos 18:20 The Jordan was the eastern border. These were the borders of the land which the families of the tribe of Benjamin received as their possession. 
06Jos 18:21 The cities belonging to the families of the tribe of Benjamin were Jericho, Beth Hoglah, Emek Keziz, 
06Jos 18:22 Beth Arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 
06Jos 18:23 Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 
06Jos 18:24 Chepharammoni, Ophni, and Geba: twelve cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 18:25 There were also Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, 
06Jos 18:26 Mizpah, Chephirah, Mozah, 
06Jos 18:27 Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 
06Jos 18:28 Zela, Haeleph, Jebus (or Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath Jearim: fourteen cities, along with the towns around them. This is the land which the families of the tribe of Benjamin received as their possession. 
06Jos 19:1 The second assignment made was for the families of the tribe of Simeon. Its territory extended into the land assigned to the tribe of Judah. 
06Jos 19:2 It included Beersheba, Sheba, Moladah, 
06Jos 19:3 Hazar Shual, Balah, Ezem, 
06Jos 19:4 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 
06Jos 19:5 Ziklag, Beth Marcaboth, Hazar Susah, 
06Jos 19:6 Beth Lebaoth, and Sharuhen: thirteen cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 19:7 There were also Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan: four cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 19:8 This included all the towns around these cities as far as Baalath Beer (or Ramah), in the south. This was the land which the families of the tribe of Simeon received as their possession. 
06Jos 19:9 Since Judah's assignment was larger than was needed, part of its territory was given to the tribe of Simeon. 
06Jos 19:10 The third assignment made was for the families of the tribe of Zebulun. The land which they received reached as far as Sarid. 
06Jos 19:11 From there the border went west to Mareal, touching Dabbesheth and the stream east of Jokneam. 
06Jos 19:12 On the other side of Sarid it went east to the border of Chisloth Tabor, then to Daberath and up to Japhia. 
06Jos 19:13 It continued east from there to Gath Hepher and Ethkazin, turning in the direction of Neah on the way to Rimmon. 
06Jos 19:14 On the north the border turned toward Hannathon, ending at Iphtahel Valley. 
06Jos 19:15 It included Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem: twelve cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 19:16 These cities and their towns were in the land which the families of the tribe of Zebulun received as their possession. 
06Jos 19:17 The fourth assignment made was for the families of the tribe of Issachar. 
06Jos 19:18 Its area included Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, 
06Jos 19:19 Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath, 
06Jos 19:20 Rabbith, Kishion, Ebez, 
06Jos 19:21 Remeth, Engannim, Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez. 
06Jos 19:22 The border also touched Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth Shemesh, ending at the Jordan. It included sixteen cities along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 19:23 These cities and their towns were in the land which the families of the tribe of Issachar received as their possession. 
06Jos 19:24 The fifth assignment made was for the families of the tribe of Asher. 
06Jos 19:25 Its area included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, 
06Jos 19:26 Allam Melech, Amad, and Mishal. On the west it touched Carmel and Shihor Libnath. 
06Jos 19:27 As it turned east, the border went to Bethdagon, touching Zebulun and Iphtahel Valley on the way north to Bethemek and Neiel. It continued north to Cabul, 
06Jos 19:28 Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah, as far as Sidon. 
06Jos 19:29 The border then turned to Ramah, reaching the fortified city of Tyre; then it turned to Hosah and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. It included Mahalab, Achzib, 
06Jos 19:30 Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob: twenty-two cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 19:31 These cities and their towns were in the land which the families of the tribe of Asher received as their possession. 
06Jos 19:32 The sixth assignment made was for the families of the tribe of Naphtali. 
06Jos 19:33 Its border went from Heleph to the oak in Zaanannim, on to Adaminekeb and to Jamnia, as far as Lakkum, and ended at the Jordan. 
06Jos 19:34 There the border turned west to Aznoth Tabor, from there to Hukkok, touching Zebulun on the south, Asher on the west, and the Jordan on the east. 
06Jos 19:35 The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, 
06Jos 19:36 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 
06Jos 19:37 Kedesh, Edrei, Enhazor, 
06Jos 19:38 Yiron, Migdalel, Horem, Bethanath, and Beth Shemesh: nineteen cities, along with the towns around them. 
06Jos 19:39 These cities and their towns were in the land which the families of the tribe of Naphtali received as their possession. 
06Jos 19:40 The seventh assignment made was for the families of the tribe of Dan. 
06Jos 19:41 Its area included Zorah, Eshtaol, Irshemesh, 
06Jos 19:42 Shaalbim, Aijalon, Ithlah, 
06Jos 19:43 Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 
06Jos 19:44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 
06Jos 19:45 Jehud, Beneberak, Gathrimmon, 
06Jos 19:46 Mejarkon, and Rakkon, as well as the territory around Joppa. 
06Jos 19:47 When the people of Dan lost their land, they went to Laish and attacked it. They captured it, killed its people, and claimed it for themselves. They settled there and changed the name of the city from Laish to Dan, naming it after their ancestor Dan. 
06Jos 19:48 These cities and their towns were in the land which the families of the tribe of Dan received as their possession. 
06Jos 19:49 When the people of Israel finished dividing up the land, they gave Joshua son of Nun a part of the land as his own. 
06Jos 19:50 As the LORD had commanded, they gave him the city he asked for: Timnath Serah, in the hill country of Ephraim. He rebuilt the city and settled there. 
06Jos 19:51 Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of the families of the tribes of Israel assigned these parts of the land by drawing lots to consult the LORD at Shiloh, at the entrance of the Tent of the LORD's presence. In this way they finished dividing the land. 
06Jos 20:1 Then the LORD told Joshua 
06Jos 20:2 to say to the people of Israel, "Choose the cities of refuge that I had Moses tell you about. 
06Jos 20:3 If any of you accidentally kills someone, you can go there and escape the one who is looking for revenge. 
06Jos 20:4 You can run away to one of these cities, go to the place of judgment at the entrance to the city, and explain to the leaders what happened. Then they will let you into the city and give you a place to live in, so that you can stay there. 
06Jos 20:5 If the one looking for revenge follows you there, the people of the city must not hand you over to that one. They must protect you because you killed the person accidentally and not out of anger. 
06Jos 20:6 You may stay in the city until you have received a public trial and until the death of the man who is then the High Priest. Then you may go back home to your own town, from which you had run away." 
06Jos 20:7 So, on the west side of the Jordan they set aside Kedesh in Galilee, in the hill country of Naphtali; Shechem, in the hill country of Ephraim; and Hebron, in the hill country of Judah. 
06Jos 20:8 East of the Jordan, on the desert plateau east of Jericho, they chose Bezer in the territory of Reuben; Ramoth in Gilead, in the territory of Gad; and Golan in Bashan, in the territory of Manasseh. 
06Jos 20:9 These were the cities of refuge chosen for all the people of Israel and for any foreigner living among them. Any who killed a person accidentally could find protection there from the one looking for revenge; they could not be killed unless they had first received a public trial. 
06Jos 21:1 The leaders of the Levite families went to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and to the heads of the families of all the tribes of Israel. 
06Jos 21:2 There at Shiloh in the land of Canaan they said to them, "The LORD commanded through Moses that we were to be given cities to live in, as well as pasture land around them for our livestock." 
06Jos 21:3 So in accordance with the LORD's command the people of Israel gave the Levites certain cities and pasture lands out of their own territories. 
06Jos 21:4 The families of the Levite clan of Kohath were the first to be assigned cities. The families who were descended from Aaron the priest were assigned thirteen cities from the territories of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. 
06Jos 21:5 The rest of the clan of Kohath was assigned ten cities from the territories of Ephraim, Dan, and West Manasseh. 
06Jos 21:6 The clan of Gershon was assigned thirteen cities from the territories of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and East Manasseh. 
06Jos 21:7 The families of the clan of Merari were assigned twelve cities from the territories of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun. 
06Jos 21:8 By drawing lots, the people of Israel assigned these cities and their pasture lands to the Levites, as the LORD had commanded through Moses. 
06Jos 21:9 These are the names of the cities from the territories of Judah and Simeon which were given 
06Jos 21:10 to the descendants of Aaron who were of the clan of Kohath, which was descended from Levi. Their assignment was the first to be made. 
06Jos 21:11 They were given the city of Arba (Arba was Anak's father), now called Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, along with the pasture land surrounding it. 
06Jos 21:12 However, the fields of the city, as well as its towns, had already been given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession. 
06Jos 21:13 In addition to Hebron (one of the cities of refuge), the following cities were assigned to the descendants of Aaron the priest: Libnah, 
06Jos 21:14 Jattir, Eshtemoa, 
06Jos 21:15 Holon, Debir, 
06Jos 21:16 Ain, Juttah, and Beth Shemesh, with their pasture lands: nine cities from the tribes of Judah and Simeon. 
06Jos 21:17 From the territory of Benjamin they were given four cities: Gibeon, Geba, 
06Jos 21:18 Anathoth, and Almon, with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:19 Thirteen cities in all, with their pasture lands, were given to the priests, the descendants of Aaron. 
06Jos 21:20 The other families of the Levite clan of Kohath were assigned some cities from the territory of Ephraim. 
06Jos 21:21 They were given four cities: Shechem and its pasture lands in the hill country of Ephraim (one of the cities of refuge), Gezer, 
06Jos 21:22 Kibzaim, and Beth Horon, with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:23 From the territory of Dan they were given four cities: Eltekeh, Gibbethon, 
06Jos 21:24 Aijalon, and Gathrimmon, with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:25 From the territory of West Manasseh they were given two cities: Taanach and Gathrimmon, with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:26 These families of the clan of Kohath received ten cities in all, with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:27 Another group of Levites, the clan of Gershon, received from the territory of East Manasseh two cities: Golan in Bashan (one of the cities of refuge) and Beeshterah, with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:28 From the territory of Issachar they received four cities: Kishion, Daberath, 
06Jos 21:29 Jarmuth, and Engannim, with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:30 From the territory of Asher they received four cities: Mishal, Abdon, 
06Jos 21:31 Helkath, and Rehob, with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:32 From the territory of Naphtali they received three cities: Kedesh in Galilee, with its pasture lands (one of the cities of refuge), Hammoth Dor, and Kartan, with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:33 The various families of the clan of Gershon received a total of thirteen cities with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:34 The rest of the Levites, the clan of Merari, received from the territory of Zebulun four cities: Jokneam, Kartah, 
06Jos 21:35 Dimnah, and Nahalal, with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:36 From the territory of Reuben they received four cities: Bezer, Jahaz, 
06Jos 21:37 Kedemoth, and Mephaath, with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:38 From the tribe of Gad they received four cities: Ramoth in Gilead, with its pasture lands (one of the cities of refuge), Mahanaim, 
06Jos 21:39 Heshbon, and Jazer, with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:40 So the clan of Merari was assigned a total of twelve cities. 
06Jos 21:41 From the land that the people of Israel possessed, a total of forty-
06Jos 21:42 eight cities, with the pasture lands around them, was given to the Levites. 
06Jos 21:43 So the LORD gave to Israel all the land that he had solemnly promised their ancestors he would give them. When they had taken possession of it, they settled down there. 
06Jos 21:44 The LORD gave them peace throughout the land, just as he had promised their ancestors. Not one of all their enemies had been able to stand against them, because the LORD gave the Israelites the victory over all their enemies. 
06Jos 21:45 The LORD kept every one of the promises that he had made to the people of Israel. 
06Jos 22:1 Then Joshua called together the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh. 
06Jos 22:2 He said to them, "You have done everything that Moses the LORD's servant ordered you to do, and you have obeyed all my commands. 
06Jos 22:3 All this time you have never once deserted the other Israelites. You have been careful to obey the commands of the LORD your God. 
06Jos 22:4 Now, as he promised, the LORD your God has given the other Israelites peace. So go back home to the land which you claimed for your own, the land on the east side of the Jordan, that Moses, the LORD's servant, gave you. 
06Jos 22:5 Make sure you obey the law that Moses commanded you: love the LORD your God, do his will, obey his commandments, be faithful to him, and serve him with all your heart and soul." 
06Jos 22:6 Joshua sent them home with his blessing and with these words: 
06Jos 22:7 "You are going back home very rich, with a lot of livestock, silver, gold, bronze, iron, and many clothes. Share with your fellow tribesmen what you took from your enemies." 
06Jos 22:8 Then they left for home. Moses had given land east of the Jordan to one half of the tribe of Manasseh, but to the other half Joshua had given land west of the Jordan, along with the other tribes. 
06Jos 22:9 So the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh went back home. They left the rest of the people of Israel at Shiloh in the land of Canaan and started out for their own land, the land of Gilead, which they had taken as the LORD had commanded them through Moses. 
06Jos 22:10 When the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh arrived at Geliloth, still on the west side of the Jordan, they built a large, impressive altar there by the river. 
06Jos 22:11 The rest of the people of Israel were told, "Listen! The people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh have built an altar at Geliloth, on our side of the Jordan!" 
06Jos 22:12 When the people of Israel heard this, the whole community came together at Shiloh to go to war against the eastern tribes. 
06Jos 22:13 Then the people of Israel sent Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, to the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh in the land of Gilead. 
06Jos 22:14 Ten leading men went with Phinehas, one from each of the western tribes and each one the head of a family among the clans. 
06Jos 22:15 They came to the land of Gilead, to the people of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh, 
06Jos 22:16 and speaking for the whole community of the LORD, they said to them, "Why have you done this evil thing against the God of Israel? You have rebelled against the LORD by building this altar for yourselves! You are no longer following him! 
06Jos 22:17 Remember our sin at Peor, when the LORD punished his own people with an epidemic? We are still suffering because of that. Wasn't that sin enough? 
06Jos 22:18 Are you going to refuse to follow him now? If you rebel against the LORD today, he will be angry with everyone in Israel tomorrow. 
06Jos 22:19 Now then, if your land is not fit to worship in, come over into the LORD's land, where his Tent is. Claim some land among us. But don't rebel against the LORD or make rebels out of us by building an altar in addition to the altar of the LORD our God. 
06Jos 22:20 Remember how Achan son of Zerah refused to obey the command about the things condemned to destruction; the whole community of Israel was punished for that. Achan was not the only one who died because of his sin." 
06Jos 22:21 The people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh answered the heads of the families of the western tribes�� 06Jos 22:22 "The Mighty One is God! He is the LORD! The Mighty One is God! He is the LORD! He knows why we did this, and we want you to know too! If we rebelled and did not keep faith with the LORD, do not let us live any longer! 
06Jos 22:23 If we disobeyed the LORD and built our own altar to burn sacrifices on or to use for grain offerings or fellowship offerings, let the LORD himself punish us. 
06Jos 22:24 No! We did it because we were afraid that in the future your descendants would say to ours, 'What do you have to do with the LORD, the God of Israel? 
06Jos 22:25 He made the Jordan a boundary between us and you people of Reuben and Gad. You have nothing to do with the LORD.' Then your descendants might make our descendants stop worshiping the LORD. 
06Jos 22:26 So we built an altar, not to burn sacrifices or make offerings, 
06Jos 22:27 but instead, as a sign for our people and yours, and for the generations after us, that we do indeed worship the LORD before his sacred Tent with our offerings to be burned and with sacrifices and fellowship offerings. This was to keep your descendants from saying that ours have nothing to do with the LORD. 
06Jos 22:28 It was our idea that, if this should ever happen, our descendants could say, 'Look! Our ancestors made an altar just like the LORD's altar. It was not for burning offerings or for sacrifice, but as a sign for our people and yours.' 
06Jos 22:29 We would certainly not rebel against the LORD or stop following him now by building an altar to burn offerings on or for grain offerings or sacrifices. We would not build any other altar than the altar of the LORD our God that stands in front of the Tent of his presence." 
06Jos 22:30 Phinehas the priest and the ten leading men of the community who were with him, the heads of families of the western tribes, heard what the people of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and East Manasseh had to say, and they were satisfied. 
06Jos 22:31 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar the priest, said to them, "Now we know that the LORD is with us. You have not rebelled against him, and so you have saved the people of Israel from the LORD's punishment." 
06Jos 22:32 Then Phinehas and the leaders left the people of Reuben and Gad in the land of Gilead and went back to Canaan, to the people of Israel, and reported to them. 
06Jos 22:33 The Israelites were satisfied and praised God. They no longer talked about going to war to devastate the land where the people of Reuben and Gad had settled. 
06Jos 22:34 The people of Reuben and Gad said, "This altar is a witness to all of us that the LORD is God." And so they named it "Witness." 
06Jos 23:1 Much later the LORD gave Israel security from their enemies around them. By that time Joshua was very old, 
06Jos 23:2 so he called all Israel, the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of the people, and said, "I am very old now. 
06Jos 23:3 You have seen everything that the LORD your God has done to all these nations because of you. The LORD your God has been fighting for you. 
06Jos 23:4 I have assigned as the possession of your tribes the land of the nations that are still left, as well as of all the nations that I have already conquered, from the Jordan River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west. 
06Jos 23:5 The LORD your God will make them retreat from you, and he will drive them away as you advance. You shall have their land, as the LORD your God has promised you. 
06Jos 23:6 So be careful to obey and do everything that is written in the book of the Law of Moses. Do not neglect any part of it, 
06Jos 23:7 and then you will not associate with these peoples left among you or speak the names of their gods or use those names in taking vows or worship those gods or bow down to them. 
06Jos 23:8 Instead, be faithful to the LORD, as you have been till now. 
06Jos 23:9 The LORD has driven great and powerful nations out as you advanced, and no one has ever been able to stand against you. 
06Jos 23:10 Any one of you can make a thousand men run away, because the LORD your God is fighting for you, just as he promised. 
06Jos 23:11 Be careful, then, to love the LORD your God. 
06Jos 23:12 If you are disloyal and join with the nations that are still left among you and intermarry with them, 
06Jos 23:13 you may be sure that the LORD your God will no longer drive these nations out as you advance. Rather, they will be as dangerous for you as a trap or a pit and as painful as a whip on your back or thorns in your eyes. And this will last until none of you are left in this good land which the LORD your God has given you. 
06Jos 23:14 "Now my time has come to die. Every one of you knows in his heart and soul that the LORD your God has given you all the good things that he promised. Every promise he made has been kept; not one has failed. 
06Jos 23:15 But just as he kept every promise that he made to you, so he will carry out every threat. 
06Jos 23:16 If you do not keep the covenant which the LORD your God commanded you to keep and if you serve and worship other gods, then in his anger he will punish you, and soon none of you will be left in this good land that he has given you." 
06Jos 24:1 Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel together at Shechem. He called the elders, the leaders, the judges, and the officers of Israel, and they came into the presence of God. 
06Jos 24:2 Joshua said to all the people, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, has to say: 'Long ago your ancestors lived on the other side of the Euphrates River and worshiped other gods. One of those ancestors was Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor. 
06Jos 24:3 Then I took Abraham, your ancestor, from the land across the Euphrates and led him through the whole land of Canaan. I gave him many descendants. I gave him Isaac, 
06Jos 24:4 and to Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. I gave Esau the hill country of Edom as his possession, but your ancestor Jacob and his children went down to Egypt. 
06Jos 24:5 Later I sent Moses and Aaron, and I brought great trouble on Egypt. But I led you out; 
06Jos 24:6 I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, and the Egyptians pursued them with chariots and cavalry. But when your ancestors got to the Red Sea 
06Jos 24:7 they cried out to me for help, and I put darkness between them and the Egyptians. I made the sea come rolling over the Egyptians and drown them. You know what I did to Egypt. " 'You lived in the desert a long time. 
06Jos 24:8 Then I brought you to the land of the Amorites, who lived on the east side of the Jordan. They fought you, but I gave you victory over them. You took their land, and I destroyed them as you advanced. 
06Jos 24:9 Then the king of Moab, Balak son of Zippor, fought against you. He sent word to Balaam son of Beor and asked him to put a curse on you. 
06Jos 24:10 But I would not listen to Balaam, so he blessed you, and in this way I rescued you from Balak. 
06Jos 24:11 You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho. The men of Jericho fought you, as did the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I gave you victory over them all. 
06Jos 24:12 As you advanced, I threw them into panic in order to drive out the two Amorite kings. Your swords and bows had nothing to do with it. 
06Jos 24:13 I gave you a land that you had never worked and cities that you had not built. Now you are living there and eating grapes from vines that you did not plant, and olives from trees that you did not plant.' 
06Jos 24:14 "Now then," Joshua continued, "honor the LORD and serve him sincerely and faithfully. Get rid of the gods which your ancestors used to worship in Mesopotamia and in Egypt, and serve only the LORD. 
06Jos 24:15 If you are not willing to serve him, decide today whom you will serve, the gods your ancestors worshiped in Mesopotamia or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you are now living. As for my family and me, we will serve the LORD." 
06Jos 24:16 The people replied, "We would never leave the LORD to serve other gods! 
06Jos 24:17 The LORD our God brought our fathers and us out of slavery in Egypt, and we saw the miracles that he performed. He kept us safe wherever we went among all the nations through which we passed. 
06Jos 24:18 As we advanced into this land, the LORD drove out all the Amorites who lived here. So we also will serve the LORD; he is our God." 
06Jos 24:19 Joshua said to the people, "But you may not be able to serve the LORD. He is a holy God and will not forgive your sins. He will tolerate no rivals, 
06Jos 24:20 and if you leave him to serve foreign gods, he will turn against you and punish you. He will destroy you, even though he was good to you before." 
06Jos 24:21 The people said to Joshua, "No! We will serve the LORD." 
06Jos 24:22 Joshua told them, "You are your own witnesses to the fact that you have chosen to serve the LORD." "Yes," they said, "we are witnesses." 
06Jos 24:23 "Then get rid of those foreign gods that you have," he demanded, "and pledge your loyalty to the LORD, the God of Israel." 
06Jos 24:24 The people then said to Joshua, "We will serve the LORD our God. We will obey his commands." 
06Jos 24:25 So Joshua made a covenant for the people that day, and there at Shechem he gave them laws and rules to follow. 
06Jos 24:26 Joshua wrote these commands in the book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up under the oak tree in the LORD's sanctuary. 
06Jos 24:27 He said to all the people, "This stone will be our witness. It has heard all the words that the LORD has spoken to us. So it will be a witness against you, to keep you from rebelling against your God." 
06Jos 24:28 Then Joshua sent the people away, and everyone returned to their own part of the land. 
06Jos 24:29 After that, the LORD's servant Joshua son of Nun died at the age of a hundred and ten. 
06Jos 24:30 They buried him on his own land at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. 
06Jos 24:31 As long as Joshua lived, the people of Israel served the LORD, and after his death they continued to do so as long as those leaders were alive who had seen for themselves everything that the LORD had done for Israel. 
06Jos 24:32 The body of Joseph, which the people of Israel had brought from Egypt, was buried at Shechem, in the piece of land that Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for a hundred pieces of silver. This land was inherited by Joseph's descendants. 
06Jos 24:33 Eleazar son of Aaron died and was buried at Gibeah, the town in the hill country of Ephraim which had been given to his son Phinehas. 
07
07Jdg 1:1 After Joshua's death the people of Israel asked the LORD, "Which of our tribes should be the first to go and attack the Canaanites?" 
07Jdg 1:2 The LORD answered, "The tribe of Judah will go first. I am giving them control of the land." 
07Jdg 1:3 The people of Judah said to the people of Simeon, "Go with us into the territory assigned to us, and we will fight the Canaanites together. Then we will go with you into the territory assigned to you." So the tribes of Simeon 
07Jdg 1:4 and Judah went into battle together. The LORD gave them victory over the Canaanites and the Perizzites, and they defeated ten thousand men at Bezek. 
07Jdg 1:5 They found Adonibezek there and fought him. 
07Jdg 1:6 He ran away, but they chased him, caught him, and cut off his thumbs and big toes. 
07Jdg 1:7 Adonibezek said, "Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off have picked up scraps under my table. God has now done to me what I did to them." He was taken to Jerusalem, where he died. 
07Jdg 1:8 The people of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it. They killed its people and set fire to the city. 
07Jdg 1:9 After this they went on to fight the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the foothills, and in the dry country to the south. 
07Jdg 1:10 They marched against the Canaanites living in the city of Hebron, which used to be called Kiriath Arba. There they defeated the clans of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai. 
07Jdg 1:11 From there the men of Judah marched against the city of Debir, at that time called Kiriath Sepher. 
07Jdg 1:12 One of them, called Caleb, said, "I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage to the man who succeeds in capturing Kiriath Sepher." 
07Jdg 1:13 Othniel, the son of Caleb's younger brother Kenaz, captured the city, so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah in marriage. 
07Jdg 1:14 On the wedding day Othniel urged her to ask her father for a field. She got down from her donkey, and Caleb asked her what she wanted. 
07Jdg 1:15 She answered, "I want some water holes. The land you have given me is in the dry country." So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs. 
07Jdg 1:16 The descendants of Moses' father-in-law, the Kenite, went on with the people of Judah from Jericho, the city of palm trees, into the barren country south of Arad in Judah. There they settled among the Amalekites. 
07Jdg 1:17 The people of Judah went with the people of Simeon, and together they defeated the Canaanites who lived in the city of Zephath. They put a curse on the city, destroyed it, and named it Hormah. 
07Jdg 1:18 The LORD helped the people of Judah, and they took possession of the hill country. But they did not capture Gaza, Ashkelon, or Ekron, with their surrounding territories. 
07Jdg 1:19 These people living along the coast had iron chariots, and so the people of Judah were not able to drive them out. 
07Jdg 1:20 As Moses had commanded, Hebron was given to Caleb, who drove out of the city the three clans descended from Anak. 
07Jdg 1:21 But the people of the tribe of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites living in Jerusalem, and the Jebusites have continued to live there with the people of Benjamin ever since. 
07Jdg 1:22 The tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh went to attack the city of Bethel, at that time called Luz. 
07Jdg 1:23 The LORD helped them. They sent spies to the city, 
07Jdg 1:24 who saw a man leaving and said to him, "Show us how to get into the city, and we won't hurt you." 
07Jdg 1:25 So he showed them, and the people of Ephraim and Manasseh killed everyone in the city, except this man and his family. 
07Jdg 1:26 He later went to the land of the Hittites, built a city there, and named it Luz, which is still its name. 
07Jdg 1:27 The tribe of Manasseh did not drive out the people living in the cities of Beth Shan, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and the nearby towns; the Canaanites continued to live there. 
07Jdg 1:28 When the Israelites became stronger, they forced the Canaanites to work for them, but still they did not drive them all out. 
07Jdg 1:29 The tribe of Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites living in the city of Gezer, and so the Canaanites continued to live there with them. 
07Jdg 1:30 The tribe of Zebulun did not drive out the people living in the cities of Kitron and Nahalal, and so the Canaanites continued to live there with them and were forced to work for them. 
07Jdg 1:31 The tribe of Asher did not drive out the people living in the cities of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphek, and Rehob. 
07Jdg 1:32 The people of Asher lived with the local Canaanites, since they had not been driven out. 
07Jdg 1:33 The tribe of Naphtali did not drive out the people living in the cities of Beth Shemesh and Bethanath. The people of Naphtali lived with the local Canaanites, but forced them to work for them. 
07Jdg 1:34 The Amorites forced the people of the tribe of Dan into the hill country and did not let them come down to the plain. 
07Jdg 1:35 The Amorites continued to live at Aijalon, Shaalbim, and Mount Heres, but the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh kept them under their rule and forced them to work for them. 
07Jdg 1:36 North of Sela, the Edomite border ran through Akrabbim Pass. 
07Jdg 2:1 The angel of the LORD went from Gilgal to Bochim and said to the Israelites, "I took you out of Egypt and brought you to the land that I promised to your ancestors. I said, 'I will never break my covenant with you. 
07Jdg 2:2 You must not make any covenant with the people who live in this land. You must tear down their altars.' But you have not done what I told you. You have done just the opposite! 
07Jdg 2:3 So I tell you now that I will not drive these people out as you advance. They will be your enemies, and you will be trapped by the worship of their gods." 
07Jdg 2:4 When the angel had said this, all the people of Israel began to cry, 
07Jdg 2:5 and that is why the place is called Bochim. There they offered sacrifices to the LORD. 
07Jdg 2:6 Joshua sent the people of Israel on their way, and each man went to take possession of his own share of the land. 
07Jdg 2:7 As long as Joshua lived, the people of Israel served the LORD, and even after his death they continued to do so as long as the leaders were alive who had seen for themselves all the great things that the LORD had done for Israel. 
07Jdg 2:8 The LORD's servant Joshua son of Nun died at the age of a hundred and ten. 
07Jdg 2:9 He was buried in his own part of the land at Timnath Serah in the hill country of Ephraim north of Mount Gaash. 
07Jdg 2:10 That whole generation also died, and the next generation forgot the LORD and what he had done for Israel. 
07Jdg 2:11 Then the people of Israel sinned against the LORD and began to serve the Baals. 
07Jdg 2:12 They stopped worshiping the LORD, the God of their ancestors, the God who had brought them out of Egypt, and they began to worship other gods, the gods of the peoples around them. They bowed down to them and made the LORD angry. 
07Jdg 2:13 They stopped worshiping the LORD and served the Baals and the Astartes. 
07Jdg 2:14 And so the LORD became furious with Israel and let raiders attack and rob them. He let the enemies all around overpower them, and the Israelites could no longer protect themselves. 
07Jdg 2:15 Every time they would go into battle, the LORD was against them, just as he had said he would be. They were in great distress. 
07Jdg 2:16 Then the LORD gave the Israelites leaders who saved them from the raiders. 
07Jdg 2:17 But the Israelites paid no attention to their leaders. Israel was unfaithful to the LORD and worshiped other gods. Their fathers had obeyed the LORD's commands, but this new generation soon stopped doing so. 
07Jdg 2:18 Whenever the LORD gave Israel a leader, the LORD would help that leader and would save the people from their enemies as long as that leader lived. The LORD would have mercy on them because they groaned under their suffering and oppression. 
07Jdg 2:19 But when the leader died, the people would return to the old ways and behave worse than the previous generation. They would serve and worship other gods, and stubbornly continue their own evil ways. 
07Jdg 2:20 Then the LORD would become furious with Israel and say, "This nation has broken the covenant that I commanded their ancestors to keep. Because they have not obeyed me, 
07Jdg 2:21 I will no longer drive out any of the nations that were still in the land when Joshua died. 
07Jdg 2:22 I will use them to find out whether or not these Israelites will follow my ways, as their ancestors did." 
07Jdg 2:23 So the LORD allowed these nations to remain in the land; he did not give Joshua victory over them, nor did he drive them out soon after Joshua's death. 
07Jdg 3:1 So then, the LORD left some nations in the land to test the Israelites who had not been through the wars in Canaan. 
07Jdg 3:2 He did this only in order to teach each generation of Israelites about war, especially those who had never been in battle before. 
07Jdg 3:3 Those left in the land were the five Philistine cities, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in the Lebanon Mountains from Mount Baal Hermon as far as Hamath Pass. 
07Jdg 3:4 They were to be a test for Israel, to find out whether or not the Israelites would obey the commands that the LORD had given their ancestors through Moses. 
07Jdg 3:5 And so the people of Israel settled down among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
07Jdg 3:6 They intermarried with them and worshiped their gods. 
07Jdg 3:7 The people of Israel forgot the LORD their God; they sinned against him and worshiped the idols of Baal and Asherah. 
07Jdg 3:8 So the LORD became angry with Israel and let King Cushan Rishathaim of Mesopotamia conquer them. They were subject to him for eight years. 
07Jdg 3:9 Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, and he sent someone to free them. This was Othniel, the son of Caleb's younger brother Kenaz. 
07Jdg 3:10 The spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he became Israel's leader. Othniel went to war, and the LORD gave him the victory over the king of Mesopotamia. 
07Jdg 3:11 There was peace in the land for forty years, and then Othniel died. 
07Jdg 3:12 The people of Israel sinned against the LORD again. Because of this the LORD made King Eglon of Moab stronger than Israel. 
07Jdg 3:13 Eglon joined the Ammonites and the Amalekites; they defeated Israel and captured Jericho, the city of palm trees. 
07Jdg 3:14 The Israelites were subject to Eglon for eighteen years. 
07Jdg 3:15 Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD, and he sent someone to free them. This was Ehud, a left-handed man, who was the son of Gera, from the tribe of Benjamin. The people of Israel sent Ehud to King Eglon of Moab with gifts for him. 
07Jdg 3:16 Ehud had made himself a double-edged sword about a foot and a half long. He had it fastened on his right side under his clothes. 
07Jdg 3:17 Then he took the gifts to Eglon, who was a very fat man. 
07Jdg 3:18 When Ehud had given him the gifts, he told the men who had carried them to go back home. 
07Jdg 3:19 But Ehud himself turned back at the carved stones near Gilgal, went back to Eglon, and said, "Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you." So the king ordered his servants, "Leave us alone!" And they all went out. 
07Jdg 3:20 Then, as the king was sitting there alone in his cool room on the roof, Ehud went over to him and said, "I have a message from God for you." The king stood up. 
07Jdg 3:21 With his left hand Ehud took the sword from his right side and plunged it into the king's belly. 
07Jdg 3:22 The whole sword went in, handle and all, and the fat covered it up. Ehud did not pull it out of the king's belly, and it stuck out behind, between his legs. 
07Jdg 3:23 Then Ehud went outside, closed the doors behind him, locked them, 
07Jdg 3:24 and left. The servants came and saw that the doors were locked, but they only thought that the king was inside, relieving himself. 
07Jdg 3:25 They waited as long as they thought they should, but when he still did not open the door, they took the key and opened it. And there was their master, lying dead on the floor. 
07Jdg 3:26 Ehud got away while they were waiting. He went past the carved stones and escaped to Seirah. 
07Jdg 3:27 When he arrived there in the hill country of Ephraim, he blew a trumpet to call the people of Israel to battle; then he led them down from the hills. 
07Jdg 3:28 He told them, "Follow me! The LORD has given you victory over your enemies, the Moabites." So they followed Ehud down and captured the place where the Moabites were to cross the Jordan; they did not allow anyone to cross. 
07Jdg 3:29 That day they killed about ten thousand of the best Moabite soldiers; none of them escaped. 
07Jdg 3:30 That day the Israelites defeated Moab, and there was peace in the land for eighty years. 
07Jdg 3:31 The next leader was Shamgar son of Anath. He too rescued Israel, and did so by killing six hundred Philistines with an oxgoad. 
07Jdg 4:1 After Ehud died, the people of Israel sinned against the LORD again. 
07Jdg 4:2 So the LORD let them be conquered by Jabin, a Canaanite king who ruled in the city of Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived at Harosheth-of-the-Gentiles. 
07Jdg 4:3 Jabin had nine hundred iron chariots, and he ruled the people of Israel with cruelty and violence for twenty years. Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD for help. 
07Jdg 4:4 Now Deborah, the wife of Lappidoth, was a prophet, and she was serving as a judge for the Israelites at that time. 
07Jdg 4:5 She would sit under a certain palm tree between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel would go there for her decisions. 
07Jdg 4:6 One day she sent for Barak son of Abinoam from the city of Kedesh in Naphtali and said to him, "The LORD, the God of Israel, has given you this command: 'Take ten thousand men from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun and lead them to Mount Tabor. 
07Jdg 4:7 I will bring Sisera, the commander of Jabin's army, to fight you at the Kishon River. He will have his chariots and soldiers, but I will give you victory over him.' " 
07Jdg 4:8 Then Barak replied, "I will go if you go with me, but if you don't go with me, I won't go either." 
07Jdg 4:9 She answered, "All right, I will go with you, but you won't get any credit for the victory, because the LORD will hand Sisera over to a woman." So Deborah set off for Kedesh with Barak. 
07Jdg 4:10 Barak called the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand men followed him. Deborah went with him. 
07Jdg 4:11 In the meantime Heber the Kenite had set up his tent close to Kedesh near the oak tree at Zaanannim. He had moved away from the other Kenites, the descendants of Hobab, the brother-in-law of Moses. 
07Jdg 4:12 When Sisera learned that Barak had gone up to Mount Tabor, 
07Jdg 4:13 he called out his nine hundred iron chariots and all his men, and sent them from Harosheth-of-the-Gentiles to the Kishon River. 
07Jdg 4:14 Then Deborah said to Barak, "Go! The LORD is leading you! Today he has given you victory over Sisera." So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with his ten thousand men. 
07Jdg 4:15 When Barak attacked with his army, the LORD threw Sisera into confusion together with all his chariots and men. Sisera got down from his chariot and fled on foot. 
07Jdg 4:16 Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-of-the-Gentiles, and Sisera's whole army was killed. Not a man was left. 
07Jdg 4:17 Sisera ran away to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because King Jabin of Hazor was at peace with Heber's family. 
07Jdg 4:18 Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Come in, sir; come into my tent. Don't be afraid." So he went in, and she hid him behind a curtain. 
07Jdg 4:19 He said to her, "Please give me a drink of water; I'm thirsty." She opened a leather bag of milk, gave him a drink, and hid him again. 
07Jdg 4:20 Then he told her, "Stand at the door of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks you if anyone is here, say no." 
07Jdg 4:21 Sisera was so tired that he fell sound asleep. Then Jael took a hammer and a tent peg, quietly went up to him, and killed him by driving the peg right through the side of his head and into the ground. 
07Jdg 4:22 When Barak came looking for Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, "Come here! I'll show you the man you're looking for." So he went in with her, and there was Sisera on the ground, dead, with the tent peg through his head. 
07Jdg 4:23 That day God gave the Israelites victory over Jabin, the Canaanite king. 
07Jdg 4:24 They pressed harder and harder against him until they destroyed him. 
07Jdg 5:1 On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song�� 07Jdg 5:2 Praise the LORD! The Israelites were determined to fight; the people gladly volunteered. 
07Jdg 5:3 Listen, you kings! Pay attention, you rulers! I will sing and play music to Israel's God, the LORD. 
07Jdg 5:4 LORD, when you left the mountains of Seir, when you came out of the region of Edom, the earth shook, and rain fell from the sky. Yes, water poured down from the clouds. 
07Jdg 5:5 The mountains quaked before the LORD of Sinai, before the LORD, the God of Israel. 
07Jdg 5:6 In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, in the days of Jael, caravans no longer went through the land, and travelers used the back roads. 
07Jdg 5:7 The towns of Israel stood abandoned, Deborah; they stood empty until you came, came like a mother for Israel. 
07Jdg 5:8 Then there was war in the land when the Israelites chose new gods. Of the forty thousand men in Israel, did anyone carry shield or spear? 
07Jdg 5:9 My heart is with the commanders of Israel, with the people who gladly volunteered. Praise the LORD! 
07Jdg 5:10 Tell of it, you that ride on white donkeys, sitting on saddles, and you that must walk wherever you go. 
07Jdg 5:11 Listen! The noisy crowds around the wells are telling of the LORD's victories, the victories of Israel's people! Then the LORD's people marched down from their cities. 
07Jdg 5:12 Lead on, Deborah, lead on! Lead on! Sing a song! Lead on! Forward, Barak son of Abinoam, lead your captives away! 
07Jdg 5:13 Then the faithful ones came down to their leaders; the LORD's people came to him ready to fight. 
07Jdg 5:14 They came from Ephraim into the valley, behind the tribe of Benjamin and its people. The commanders came down from Machir, the officers down from Zebulun. 
07Jdg 5:15 The leaders of Issachar came with Deborah; yes, Issachar came and Barak too, and they followed him into the valley. But the tribe of Reuben was divided; they could not decide to come. 
07Jdg 5:16 Why did they stay behind with the sheep? To listen to shepherds calling the flocks? Yes, the tribe of Reuben was divided; they could not decide to come. 
07Jdg 5:17 The tribe of Gad stayed east of the Jordan, and the tribe of Dan remained by the ships. The tribe of Asher stayed by the seacoast; they remained along the shore. 
07Jdg 5:18 But the people of Zebulun and Naphtali risked their lives on the battlefield. 
07Jdg 5:19 At Taanach, by the stream of Megiddo, the kings came and fought; the kings of Canaan fought, but they took no silver away. 
07Jdg 5:20 The stars fought from the sky; as they moved across the sky, they fought against Sisera. 
07Jdg 5:21 A flood in the Kishon swept them away - the onrushing Kishon River. I shall march, march on, with strength! 
07Jdg 5:22 Then the horses came galloping on, stamping the ground with their hoofs. 
07Jdg 5:23 "Put a curse on Meroz," says the angel of the LORD, "a curse, a curse on those who live there. They did not come to help the LORD, come as soldiers to fight for him." 
07Jdg 5:24 The most fortunate of women is Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite - the most fortunate of women who live in tents. 
07Jdg 5:25 Sisera asked for water, but she gave him milk; she brought him cream in a beautiful bowl. 
07Jdg 5:26 She took a tent peg in one hand, a worker's hammer in the other; she struck Sisera and crushed his skull; she pierced him through the head. 
07Jdg 5:27 He sank to his knees, fell down and lay still at her feet. At her feet he sank to his knees and fell; he fell to the ground, dead. 
07Jdg 5:28 Sisera's mother looked out of the window; she gazed from behind the lattice. "Why is his chariot so late in coming?" she asked. "Why are his horses so slow to return?" 
07Jdg 5:29 Her wisest friends answered her, and she told herself over and over, 
07Jdg 5:30 "They are only finding things to capture and divide, a woman or two for every soldier, rich cloth for Sisera, embroidered pieces for the neck of the queen." 
07Jdg 5:31 So may all your enemies die like that, O LORD, but may your friends shine like the rising sun! And there was peace in the land for forty years. 
07Jdg 6:1 Once again the people of Israel sinned against the LORD, so he let the people of Midian rule them for seven years. 
07Jdg 6:2 The Midianites were stronger than Israel, and the people of Israel hid from them in caves and other safe places in the hills. 
07Jdg 6:3 Whenever the Israelites would plant their crops, the Midianites would come with the Amalekites and the desert tribes and attack them. 
07Jdg 6:4 They would camp on the land and destroy the crops as far south as the area around Gaza. They would take all the sheep, cattle, and donkeys, and leave nothing for the Israelites to live on. 
07Jdg 6:5 They would come with their livestock and tents, as thick as locusts. They and their camels were too many to count. They came and devastated the land, 
07Jdg 6:6 and Israel was helpless against them. 
07Jdg 6:7 Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD for help against the Midianites, 
07Jdg 6:8 and he sent them a prophet who brought them this message from the LORD, the God of Israel: "I brought you out of slavery in Egypt. 
07Jdg 6:9 I rescued you from the Egyptians and from the people who fought you here in this land. I drove them out as you advanced, and I gave you their land. 
07Jdg 6:10 I told you that I am the LORD your God and that you should not worship the gods of the Amorites, whose land you are now living in. But you have not listened to me." 
07Jdg 6:11 Then the LORD's angel came to the village of Ophrah and sat under the oak tree that belonged to Joash, a man of the clan of Abiezer. His son Gideon was threshing some wheat secretly in a wine press, so that the Midianites would not see him. 
07Jdg 6:12 The LORD's angel appeared to him there and said, "The LORD is with you, brave and mighty man!" 
07Jdg 6:13 Gideon said to him, "If I may ask, sir, why has all this happened to us if the LORD is with us? What happened to all the wonderful things that our fathers told us the LORD used to do - how he brought them out of Egypt? The LORD has abandoned us and left us to the mercy of the Midianites." 
07Jdg 6:14 Then the LORD ordered him, "Go with all your great strength and rescue Israel from the Midianites. I myself am sending you." 
07Jdg 6:15 Gideon replied, "But Lord, how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest in the tribe of Manasseh, and I am the least important member of my family." 
07Jdg 6:16 The LORD answered, "You can do it because I will help you. You will crush the Midianites as easily as if they were only one man." 
07Jdg 6:17 Gideon replied, "If you are pleased with me, give me some proof that you are really the LORD. 
07Jdg 6:18 Please do not leave until I bring you an offering of food." He said, "I will stay until you come back." 
07Jdg 6:19 So Gideon went into his house and cooked a young goat and used a bushel of flour to make bread without any yeast. He put the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, brought them to the LORD's angel under the oak tree, and gave them to him. 
07Jdg 6:20 The angel told him, "Put the meat and the bread on this rock, and pour the broth over them." Gideon did so. 
07Jdg 6:21 Then the LORD's angel reached out and touched the meat and the bread with the end of the stick he was holding. Fire came out of the rock and burned up the meat and the bread. Then the angel disappeared. 
07Jdg 6:22 Gideon then realized that it was the LORD's angel he had seen, and he said in terror, "Sovereign LORD! I have seen your angel face-to-face!" 
07Jdg 6:23 But the LORD told him, "Peace. Don't be afraid. You will not die." 
07Jdg 6:24 Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and named it "The LORD is Peace." (It is still standing at Ophrah, which belongs to the clan of Abiezer.) 
07Jdg 6:25 That night the LORD told Gideon, "Take your father's bull and another bull seven years old, tear down your father's altar to Baal, and cut down the symbol of the goddess Asherah, which is beside it. 
07Jdg 6:26 Build a well-constructed altar to the LORD your God on top of this mound. Then take the second bull and burn it whole as an offering, using for firewood the symbol of Asherah you have cut down." 
07Jdg 6:27 So Gideon took ten of his servants and did what the LORD had told him. He was too afraid of his family and the people in town to do it by day, so he did it at night. 
07Jdg 6:28 When the people in town got up early the next morning, they found that the altar to Baal and the symbol of Asherah had been cut down, and that the second bull had been burned on the altar that had been built there. 
07Jdg 6:29 They asked each other, "Who did this?" They investigated and found out that Gideon son of Joash had done it. 
07Jdg 6:30 Then they said to Joash, "Bring your son out here, so that we can kill him! He tore down the altar to Baal and cut down the symbol of Asherah beside it." 
07Jdg 6:31 But Joash said to all those who confronted him, "Are you arguing for Baal? Are you defending him? Anyone who argues for him will be killed before morning. If Baal is a god, let him defend himself. It is his altar that was torn down." 
07Jdg 6:32 From then on Gideon was known as Jerubbaal, because Joash said, "Let Baal defend himself; it is his altar that was torn down." 
07Jdg 6:33 Then all the Midianites, the Amalekites, and the desert tribes assembled, crossed the Jordan River, and camped in Jezreel Valley. 
07Jdg 6:34 The spirit of the LORD took control of Gideon, and he blew a trumpet to call the men of the clan of Abiezer to follow him. 
07Jdg 6:35 He sent messengers throughout the territory of both parts of Manasseh to call them to follow him. He sent messengers to the tribes of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they also came to join him. 
07Jdg 6:36 Then Gideon said to God, "You say that you have decided to use me to rescue Israel. 
07Jdg 6:37 Well, I am putting some wool on the ground where we thresh the wheat. If in the morning there is dew only on the wool but not on the ground, then I will know that you are going to use me to rescue Israel." 
07Jdg 6:38 That is exactly what happened. When Gideon got up early the next morning, he squeezed the wool and wrung enough dew out of it to fill a bowl with water. 
07Jdg 6:39 Then Gideon said to God, "Don't be angry with me; let me speak just once more. Please let me make one more test with the wool. This time let the wool be dry, and the ground be wet." 
07Jdg 6:40 That night God did that very thing. The next morning the wool was dry, but the ground was wet with dew. 
07Jdg 7:1 One day Gideon and all his men got up early and camped beside Harod Spring. The Midianite camp was in the valley to the north of them by Moreh Hill. 
07Jdg 7:2 The LORD said to Gideon, "The men you have are too many for me to give them victory over the Midianites. They might think that they had won by themselves, and so give me no credit. 
07Jdg 7:3 Announce to the people, 'Anyone who is afraid should go back home, and we will stay here at Mount Gilead.' " So twenty-two thousand went back, but ten thousand stayed. 
07Jdg 7:4 Then the LORD said to Gideon, "You still have too many men. Take them down to the water, and I will separate them for you there. If I tell you a man should go with you, he will go. If I tell you a man should not go with you, he will not go." 
07Jdg 7:5 Gideon took the men down to the water, and the LORD told him, "Separate everyone who laps up the water with his tongue like a dog, from everyone who gets down on his knees to drink." 
07Jdg 7:6 There were three hundred men who scooped up water in their hands and lapped it; all the others got down on their knees to drink. 
07Jdg 7:7 The LORD said to Gideon, "I will rescue you and give you victory over the Midianites with the three hundred men who lapped the water. Tell everyone else to go home." 
07Jdg 7:8 So Gideon sent all the Israelites home, except the three hundred, who kept all the supplies and trumpets. The Midianite camp was below them in the valley. 
07Jdg 7:9 That night the LORD commanded Gideon, "Get up and attack the camp; I am giving you victory over it. 
07Jdg 7:10 But if you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah. 
07Jdg 7:11 You will hear what they are saying, and then you will have the courage to attack." So Gideon and his servant Purah went down to the edge of the enemy camp. 
07Jdg 7:12 The Midianites, the Amalekites, and the desert tribesmen were spread out in the valley like a swarm of locusts, and they had as many camels as there are grains of sand on the seashore. 
07Jdg 7:13 When Gideon arrived, he heard a man telling a friend about a dream. He was saying, "I dreamed that a loaf of barley bread rolled into our camp and hit a tent. The tent collapsed and lay flat on the ground." 
07Jdg 7:14 His friend replied, "It's the sword of the Israelite, Gideon son of Joash! It can't mean anything else! God has given him victory over Midian and our whole army!" 
07Jdg 7:15 When Gideon heard about the man's dream and what it meant, he fell to his knees and worshiped the LORD. Then he went back to the Israelite camp and said, "Get up! The LORD is giving you victory over the Midianite army!" 
07Jdg 7:16 He divided his three hundred men into three groups and gave each man a trumpet and a jar with a torch inside it. 
07Jdg 7:17 He told them, "When I get to the edge of the camp, watch me, and do what I do. 
07Jdg 7:18 When my group and I blow our trumpets, then you blow yours all around the camp and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon!' " 
07Jdg 7:19 Gideon and his one hundred men came to the edge of the camp a while before midnight, just after the guard had been changed. Then they blew the trumpets and broke the jars they were holding, 
07Jdg 7:20 and the other two groups did the same. They all held the torches in their left hands, the trumpets in their right, and shouted, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!" 
07Jdg 7:21 Every man stood in his place around the camp, and the whole enemy army ran away yelling. 
07Jdg 7:22 While Gideon's men were blowing their trumpets, the LORD made the enemy troops attack each other with their swords. They ran toward Zarethan as far as Beth Shittah, as far as the town of Abel Meholah near Tabbath. 
07Jdg 7:23 Then men from the tribes of Naphtali, Asher, and both parts of Manasseh were called out, and they pursued the Midianites. 
07Jdg 7:24 Gideon sent messengers through all the hill country of Ephraim to say, "Come down and fight the Midianites. Hold the Jordan River and the streams as far as Bethbarah, to keep the Midianites from crossing them." The men of Ephraim were called together, and they held the Jordan River and the streams as far as Bethbarah. 
07Jdg 7:25 They captured the two Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeeb; they killed Oreb at Oreb Rock, and Zeeb at the Winepress of Zeeb. They continued to pursue the Midianites and brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was now east of the Jordan. 
07Jdg 8:1 Then the people of Ephraim said to Gideon, "Why didn't you call us when you went to fight the Midianites? Why did you treat us like this?" They complained bitterly about it. 
07Jdg 8:2 But he told them, "What I was able to do is nothing compared with what you have done. Even the little that you people of Ephraim did is worth more than what my whole clan has done. 
07Jdg 8:3 After all, through the power of God you killed the two Midianite chiefs, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I done to compare with that?" When he said this, they were no longer so angry. 
07Jdg 8:4 By this time Gideon and his three hundred men had come to the Jordan River and had crossed it. They were exhausted, but were still pursuing the enemy. 
07Jdg 8:5 When they arrived at Sukkoth, he said to the men of the town, "Please give my men some loaves of bread. They are exhausted, and I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the Midianite kings." 
07Jdg 8:6 But the leaders of Sukkoth said, "Why should we give your army any food? You haven't captured Zebah and Zalmunna yet." 
07Jdg 8:7 So Gideon said, "All right! When the LORD has handed Zebah and Zalmunna over to me, I will beat you with thorns and briers from the desert!" 
07Jdg 8:8 Gideon went on to Penuel and made the same request of the people there, but the men of Penuel gave the same answer as the men of Sukkoth. 
07Jdg 8:9 So he said to them, "I am going to come back safe and sound, and when I do, I will tear this tower down!" 
07Jdg 8:10 Zebah and Zalmunna were at Karkor with their army. Of the whole army of desert tribesmen, only about 15,000 were left; 120,000 soldiers had been killed. 
07Jdg 8:11 Gideon went on the road along the edge of the desert, east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and attacked the army by surprise. 
07Jdg 8:12 The two Midianite kings, Zebah and Zalmunna, ran away, but he pursued them and captured them, and caused their whole army to panic. 
07Jdg 8:13 When Gideon was returning from the battle by way of Heres Pass, 
07Jdg 8:14 he captured a young man from Sukkoth and questioned him. The young man wrote down for Gideon the names of the seventy-seven leading men of Sukkoth. 
07Jdg 8:15 Then Gideon went to the men of Sukkoth and said, "Remember when you refused to help me? You said that you couldn't give any food to my exhausted army because I hadn't captured Zebah and Zalmunna yet. Well, here they are!" 
07Jdg 8:16 He then took thorns and briers from the desert and used them to punish the leaders of Sukkoth. 
07Jdg 8:17 He also tore down the tower at Penuel and killed the men of that city. 
07Jdg 8:18 Then Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna, "What about the men you killed at Tabor?" They answered, "They looked like you - every one of them like the son of a king." 
07Jdg 8:19 Gideon said, "They were my brothers, my own mother's sons. I solemnly swear that if you had not killed them, I would not kill you." 
07Jdg 8:20 Then he said to Jether, his oldest son, "Go ahead, kill them!" But the boy did not draw his sword. He hesitated, because he was still only a boy. 
07Jdg 8:21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, "Come on, kill us yourself. It takes a man to do a man's job." So Gideon killed them and took the ornaments that were on the necks of their camels. 
07Jdg 8:22 After that, the Israelites said to Gideon, "Be our ruler - you and your descendants after you. You have saved us from the Midianites." 
07Jdg 8:23 Gideon answered, "I will not be your ruler, nor will my son. The LORD will be your ruler." 
07Jdg 8:24 But he went on to say, "Let me ask one thing of you. Every one of you give me the earrings you took." (The Midianites, like other desert people, wore gold earrings.) 
07Jdg 8:25 The people answered, "We'll be glad to give them to you." They spread out a cloth, and everyone put on it the earrings that he had taken. 
07Jdg 8:26 The gold earrings that Gideon got weighed over forty pounds, and this did not include the ornaments, necklaces, and purple clothes that the kings of Midian wore, nor the collars that were around the necks of their camels. 
07Jdg 8:27 Gideon made an idol from the gold and put it in his hometown, Ophrah. All the Israelites abandoned God and went there to worship the idol. It was a trap for Gideon and his family. 
07Jdg 8:28 So Midian was defeated by the Israelites and was no longer a threat. The land was at peace for forty years, until Gideon died. 
07Jdg 8:29 Gideon went back to his own home and lived there. 
07Jdg 8:30 He had seventy sons, because he had many wives. 
07Jdg 8:31 He also had a concubine in Shechem; she bore him a son, and he named him Abimelech. 
07Jdg 8:32 Gideon son of Joash died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash, at Ophrah, the town of the clan of Abiezer. 
07Jdg 8:33 After Gideon's death the people of Israel were unfaithful to God again and worshiped the Baals. They made Baal-of-the-Covenant their god, 
07Jdg 8:34 and no longer served the LORD their God, who had saved them from all their enemies around them. 
07Jdg 8:35 They were not grateful to the family of Gideon for all the good that he had done for Israel. 
07Jdg 9:1 Gideon's son Abimelech went to the town of Shechem, where all his mother's relatives lived, and told them 
07Jdg 9:2 to ask the men of Shechem, "Which would you prefer? To have all seventy of Gideon's sons govern you or to have just one man? Remember that Abimelech is your own flesh and blood." 
07Jdg 9:3 His mother's relatives talked to the men of Shechem about this for him, and the men of Shechem decided to follow Abimelech because he was their relative. 
07Jdg 9:4 They gave him seventy pieces of silver from the temple of Baal-of-the-Covenant, and with this money he hired a bunch of worthless scoundrels to join him. 
07Jdg 9:5 He went to his father's house at Ophrah, and there on top of a single stone he killed his seventy brothers, Gideon's sons. But Jotham, Gideon's youngest son, hid and was not killed. 
07Jdg 9:6 Then all the men of Shechem and Bethmillo got together and went to the sacred oak tree at Shechem, where they made Abimelech king. 
07Jdg 9:7 When Jotham heard about this, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and shouted out to them, "Listen to me, you men of Shechem, and God may listen to you! 
07Jdg 9:8 Once upon a time the trees went out to choose a king for themselves. They said to the olive tree, 'Be our king.' 
07Jdg 9:9 The olive tree answered, 'In order to govern you, I would have to stop producing my oil, which is used to honor gods and human beings.' 
07Jdg 9:10 Then the trees said to the fig tree, 'You come and be our king.' 
07Jdg 9:11 But the fig tree answered, 'In order to govern you, I would have to stop producing my good sweet fruit.' 
07Jdg 9:12 So the trees then said to the grapevine, 'You come and be our king.' 
07Jdg 9:13 But the vine answered, 'In order to govern you, I would have to stop producing my wine, that makes gods and human beings happy.' 
07Jdg 9:14 So then all the trees said to the thorn bush, 'You come and be our king.' 
07Jdg 9:15 The thorn bush answered, 'If you really want to make me your king, then come and take shelter in my shade. If you don't, fire will blaze out of my thorny branches and burn up the cedars of Lebanon.' 
07Jdg 9:16 "Now then," Jotham continued, "were you really honest and sincere when you made Abimelech king? Did you respect Gideon's memory and treat his family properly, as his actions deserved? 
07Jdg 9:17 Remember that my father fought for you. He risked his life to save you from the Midianites. 
07Jdg 9:18 But today you turned against my father's family. You killed his sons - seventy men on a single stone - and just because Abimelech, his son by his servant woman, is your relative, you have made him king of Shechem. 
07Jdg 9:19 Now then, if what you did today to Gideon and his family was sincere and honest, then be happy with Abimelech and let him be happy with you. 
07Jdg 9:20 But if not, may fire blaze out from Abimelech and burn up the men of Shechem and Bethmillo. May fire blaze out from the men of Shechem and Bethmillo and burn Abimelech up." 
07Jdg 9:21 Then because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech, Jotham ran away and went to live at Beer. 
07Jdg 9:22 Abimelech ruled Israel for three years. 
07Jdg 9:23 Then God made Abimelech and the men of Shechem hostile to each other, and they rebelled against Abimelech. 
07Jdg 9:24 This happened so that Abimelech and the men of Shechem, who encouraged him to murder Gideon's seventy sons, would pay for their crime. 
07Jdg 9:25 The men of Shechem put men in ambush against Abimelech on the mountaintops, and they robbed everyone who passed their way. Abimelech was told about this. 
07Jdg 9:26 Then Gaal son of Ebed came to Shechem with his brothers, and the men of Shechem put their confidence in him. 
07Jdg 9:27 They all went out into their vineyards and picked the grapes, made wine from them, and held a festival. They went into the temple of their god, where they ate and drank and made fun of Abimelech. 
07Jdg 9:28 Gaal said, "What kind of men are we in Shechem? Why are we serving Abimelech? Who is he, anyway? The son of Gideon! And Zebul takes orders from him, but why should we serve him? Be loyal to your ancestor Hamor, who founded your clan! 
07Jdg 9:29 I wish I were leading this people! I would get rid of Abimelech! I would tell him, 'Reinforce your army, come on out and fight!' " 
07Jdg 9:30 Zebul, the ruler of the city, became angry when he heard what Gaal had said. 
07Jdg 9:31 He sent messengers to Abimelech at Arumah to say, "Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to Shechem, and they are not going to let you into the city. 
07Jdg 9:32 Now then, you and your men should move by night and hide in the fields. 
07Jdg 9:33 Get up tomorrow morning at sunrise and make a sudden attack on the city. Then when Gaal and his men come out against you, hit them with all you've got!" 
07Jdg 9:34 So Abimelech and all his men made their move at night and hid outside Shechem in four groups. 
07Jdg 9:35 When Abimelech and his men saw Gaal come out and stand at the city gate, they got up from their hiding places. 
07Jdg 9:36 Gaal saw them and said to Zebul, "Look! There are men coming down from the mountaintops!" "Those are not men," Zebul answered. "They are just shadows on the mountains." 
07Jdg 9:37 Gaal said again, "Look! There are men coming down the crest of the mountain and one group is coming along the road from the oak tree of the fortunetellers!" 
07Jdg 9:38 Then Zebul said to him, "Where is all your big talk now? You were the one who asked why we should serve this man Abimelech. These are the men you were making fun of. Go on out now and fight them." 
07Jdg 9:39 Gaal led the men of Shechem out and fought Abimelech. 
07Jdg 9:40 Abimelech started after Gaal, and Gaal ran. Many were wounded, even at the city gate. 
07Jdg 9:41 Abimelech lived in Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem, so that they could no longer live there. 
07Jdg 9:42 The next day Abimelech found out that the people of Shechem were planning to go out into the fields, 
07Jdg 9:43 so he took his men, divided them into three groups, and hid in the fields, waiting. When he saw the people coming out of the city, he came out of hiding to kill them. 
07Jdg 9:44 While Abimelech and his group hurried forward to guard the city gate, the other two companies attacked the people in the fields and killed them all. 
07Jdg 9:45 The fighting continued all day long. Abimelech captured the city, killed its people, tore it down, and covered the ground with salt. 
07Jdg 9:46 When all the leading men in the fort at Shechem heard about this, they sought safety in the stronghold of the temple of Baal-of-the-Covenant. 
07Jdg 9:47 Abimelech was told that they had gathered there, 
07Jdg 9:48 so he went up to Mount Zalmon with his men. There he took an ax, cut a limb off a tree, and put it on his shoulder. He told his men to hurry and do the same thing. 
07Jdg 9:49 So everyone cut off a tree limb; then they followed Abimelech and piled the wood up against the stronghold. They set it on fire, with the people inside, and all the people of the fort died - about a thousand men and women. 
07Jdg 9:50 Then Abimelech went to Thebez, surrounded that city, and captured it. 
07Jdg 9:51 There was a strong tower there, and every man and woman in the city, including the leaders, ran to it. They locked themselves in and went up to the roof. 
07Jdg 9:52 When Abimelech came to attack the tower, he went up to the door to set the tower on fire. 
07Jdg 9:53 But a woman threw a millstone down on his head and fractured his skull. 
07Jdg 9:54 Then he quickly called the young man who was carrying his weapons and told him, "Draw your sword and kill me. I don't want it said that a woman killed me." So the young man ran him through, and he died. 
07Jdg 9:55 When the Israelites saw that Abimelech was dead, they all went home. 
07Jdg 9:56 And so it was that God paid Abimelech back for the crime that he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers. 
07Jdg 9:57 God also made the men of Shechem suffer for their wickedness, just as Jotham, Gideon's son, said they would when he cursed them. 
07Jdg 10:1 After Abimelech's death Tola, the son of Puah and grandson of Dodo, came to free Israel. He was from the tribe of Issachar and lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. 
07Jdg 10:2 He was Israel's leader for twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried at Shamir. 
07Jdg 10:3 After Tola came Jair from Gilead. He led Israel for twenty-two years. 
07Jdg 10:4 He had thirty sons who rode thirty donkeys. They had thirty cities in the land of Gilead, which are still called the villages of Jair. 
07Jdg 10:5 Jair died and was buried at Kamon. 
07Jdg 10:6 Once again the Israelites sinned against the LORD by worshiping the Baals and the Astartes, as well as the gods of Syria, of Sidon, of Moab, of Ammon, and of Philistia. They abandoned the LORD and stopped worshiping him. 
07Jdg 10:7 So the LORD became angry with the Israelites, and let the Philistines and the Ammonites conquer them. 
07Jdg 10:8 For eighteen years they oppressed and persecuted all the Israelites who lived in Amorite country east of the Jordan River in Gilead. 
07Jdg 10:9 The Ammonites even crossed the Jordan to fight the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim. Israel was in great distress. 
07Jdg 10:10 Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD and said, "We have sinned against you, for we left you, our God, and worshiped the Baals." 
07Jdg 10:11 The LORD gave them this answer: "The Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines, 
07Jdg 10:12 the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites oppressed you in the past, and you cried out to me. Did I not save you from them? 
07Jdg 10:13 But you still left me and worshiped other gods, so I am not going to rescue you again. 
07Jdg 10:14 Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen. Let them rescue you when you get in trouble." 
07Jdg 10:15 But the people of Israel said to the LORD, "We have sinned. Do whatever you like, but please, save us today." 
07Jdg 10:16 So they got rid of their foreign gods and worshiped the LORD; and he became troubled over Israel's distress. 
07Jdg 10:17 Then the Ammonite army prepared for battle and camped in Gilead. The people of Israel came together and camped at Mizpah in Gilead. 
07Jdg 10:18 There the people and the leaders of the Israelite tribes asked one another, "Who will lead the fight against the Ammonites? Whoever does will be the leader of everyone in Gilead." 
07Jdg 11:1 Jephthah, a brave soldier from Gilead, was the son of a prostitute. His father Gilead 
07Jdg 11:2 had other sons by his wife, and when they grew up, they forced Jephthah to leave home. They told him, "You will not inherit anything from our father; you are the son of another woman." 
07Jdg 11:3 Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. There he attracted a group of worthless men, and they went around with him. 
07Jdg 11:4 It was some time later that the Ammonites went to war against Israel. 
07Jdg 11:5 When this happened, the leaders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah back from the land of Tob. 
07Jdg 11:6 They told him, "Come and lead us, so that we can fight the Ammonites." 
07Jdg 11:7 But Jephthah answered, "You hated me so much that you forced me to leave my father's house. Why come to me now that you're in trouble?" 
07Jdg 11:8 They said to Jephthah, "We are turning to you now because we want you to go with us and fight the Ammonites and lead all the people of Gilead." 
07Jdg 11:9 Jephthah said to them, "If you take me back home to fight the Ammonites and the LORD gives me victory, I will be your ruler." 
07Jdg 11:10 They replied, "We agree. The LORD is our witness." 
07Jdg 11:11 So Jephthah went with the leaders of Gilead, and the people made him their ruler and leader. Jephthah stated his terms at Mizpah in the presence of the LORD. 
07Jdg 11:12 Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon to say, "What is your quarrel with us? Why have you invaded our country?" 
07Jdg 11:13 The king of Ammon answered Jephthah's messengers, "When the Israelites came out of Egypt, they took away my land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River and the Jordan River. Now you must give it back peacefully." 
07Jdg 11:14 Jephthah sent messengers back to the king of Ammon 
07Jdg 11:15 with this answer: "It is not true that Israel took away the land of Moab or the land of Ammon. 
07Jdg 11:16 This is what happened: when the Israelites left Egypt, they went through the desert to the Gulf of Aqaba and came to Kadesh. 
07Jdg 11:17 Then they sent messengers to the king of Edom to ask permission to go through his land. But the king of Edom would not let them. They also asked the king of Moab, but neither would he let them go through his land. So the Israelites stayed at Kadesh. 
07Jdg 11:18 Then they went on through the desert, going around the land of Edom and the land of Moab until they came to the east side of Moab, on the other side of the Arnon River. They camped there, but they did not cross the Arnon because it was the boundary of Moab. 
07Jdg 11:19 Then the Israelites sent messengers to Sihon, the Amorite king of Heshbon, and asked him for permission to go through his country to their own land. 
07Jdg 11:20 But Sihon would not let Israel do it. He brought his whole army together, camped at Jahaz, and attacked Israel. 
07Jdg 11:21 But the LORD, the God of Israel, gave the Israelites victory over Sihon and his army. So the Israelites took possession of all the territory of the Amorites who lived in that country. 
07Jdg 11:22 They occupied all the Amorite territory from the Arnon in the south to the Jabbok in the north and from the desert on the east to the Jordan on the west. 
07Jdg 11:23 So it was the LORD, the God of Israel, who drove out the Amorites for his people, the Israelites. 
07Jdg 11:24 Are you going to try to take it back? You can keep whatever your god Chemosh has given you. But we are going to keep everything that the LORD, our God, has taken for us. 
07Jdg 11:25 Do you think you are any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? He never challenged Israel, did he? Did he ever go to war against us? 
07Jdg 11:26 For three hundred years Israel has occupied Heshbon and Aroer, and the towns around them, and all the cities on the banks of the Arnon River. Why haven't you taken them back in all this time? 
07Jdg 11:27 No, I have not done you any wrong. You are doing wrong by making war on me. The LORD is the judge. He will decide today between the Israelites and the Ammonites." 
07Jdg 11:28 But the king of Ammon paid no attention to this message from Jephthah. 
07Jdg 11:29 Then the spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah. He went through Gilead and Manasseh and returned to Mizpah in Gilead and went on to Ammon. 
07Jdg 11:30 Jephthah promised the LORD: "If you will give me victory over the Ammonites, 
07Jdg 11:31 I will burn as an offering the first person that comes out of my house to meet me, when I come back from the victory. I will offer that person to you as a sacrifice." 
07Jdg 11:32 So Jephthah crossed the river to fight the Ammonites, and the LORD gave him victory. 
07Jdg 11:33 He struck at them from Aroer to the area around Minnith, twenty cities in all, and as far as Abel Keramim. There was a great slaughter, and the Ammonites were defeated by Israel. 
07Jdg 11:34 When Jephthah went back home to Mizpah, there was his daughter coming out to meet him, dancing and playing the tambourine. She was his only child. 
07Jdg 11:35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes in sorrow and said, "Oh, my daughter! You are breaking my heart! Why must it be you that causes me pain? I have made a solemn promise to the LORD, and I cannot take it back!" 
07Jdg 11:36 She told him, "If you have made a promise to the LORD, do what you said you would do to me, since the LORD has given you revenge on your enemies, the Ammonites." 
07Jdg 11:37 But she asked her father, "Do this one thing for me. Leave me alone for two months, so that I can go with my friends to wander in the mountains and grieve that I must die a virgin." 
07Jdg 11:38 He told her to go and sent her away for two months. She and her friends went up into the mountains and grieved because she was going to die unmarried and childless. 
07Jdg 11:39 After two months she came back to her father. He did what he had promised the LORD, and she died still a virgin. This was the origin of the custom in Israel 
07Jdg 11:40 that the Israelite women would go out for four days every year to grieve for the daughter of Jephthah of Gilead. 
07Jdg 12:1 The men of Ephraim prepared for battle; they crossed the Jordan River to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, "Why did you cross the border to fight the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? We'll burn the house down over your head!" 
07Jdg 12:2 But Jephthah told them, "My people and I had a serious quarrel with the Ammonites. I did call you, but you would not rescue me from them. 
07Jdg 12:3 When I saw that you were not going to, I risked my life and crossed the border to fight them, and the LORD gave me victory over them. So why are you coming up to fight me now?" 
07Jdg 12:4 Then Jephthah brought all the men of Gilead together, fought the men of Ephraim and defeated them. (The Ephraimites had said, "You Gileadites in Ephraim and Manasseh, you are deserters from Ephraim!") 
07Jdg 12:5 In order to keep the Ephraimites from escaping, the Gileadites captured the places where the Jordan could be crossed. When any Ephraimite who was trying to escape would ask permission to cross, the men of Gilead would ask, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If he said, "No," 
07Jdg 12:6 they would tell him to say "Shibboleth." But he would say "Sibboleth," because he could not pronounce it correctly. Then they would grab him and kill him there at one of the Jordan River crossings. At that time forty-two thousand of the Ephraimites were killed. 
07Jdg 12:7 Jephthah led Israel for six years. Then he died and was buried in his hometown in Gilead. 
07Jdg 12:8 After Jephthah, Ibzan from Bethlehem led Israel. 
07Jdg 12:9 He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He gave his daughters in marriage outside the clan and brought thirty young women from outside the clan for his sons to marry. Ibzan led Israel for seven years, 
07Jdg 12:10 then he died and was buried at Bethlehem. 
07Jdg 12:11 After Ibzan, Elon from Zebulun led Israel for ten years. 
07Jdg 12:12 Then he died and was buried at Aijalon in the territory of Zebulun. 
07Jdg 12:13 After Elon, Abdon son of Hillel from Pirathon led Israel. 
07Jdg 12:14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. Abdon led Israel for eight years, 
07Jdg 12:15 then he died and was buried at Pirathon in the territory of Ephraim in the hill country of the Amalekites. 
07Jdg 13:1 The Israelites sinned against the LORD again, and he let the Philistines rule them for forty years. 
07Jdg 13:2 At that time there was a man named Manoah from the town of Zorah. He was a member of the tribe of Dan. His wife had never been able to have children. 
07Jdg 13:3 The LORD's angel appeared to her and said, "You have never been able to have children, but you will soon be pregnant and have a son. 
07Jdg 13:4 Be sure not to drink any wine or beer, or eat any forbidden food; 
07Jdg 13:5 and after your son is born, you must never cut his hair, because from the day of his birth he will be dedicated to God as a nazirite. He will begin the work of rescuing Israel from the Philistines." 
07Jdg 13:6 Then the woman went and told her husband, "A man of God has come to me, and he looked as frightening as the angel of God. I didn't ask him where he came from, and he didn't tell me his name. 
07Jdg 13:7 But he did tell me that I would become pregnant and have a son. He told me not to drink any wine or beer, or eat any forbidden food, because the boy is to be dedicated to God as a nazirite as long as he lives." 
07Jdg 13:8 Then Manoah prayed to the LORD, "Please, LORD, let the man of God that you sent come back to us and tell us what we must do with the boy when he is born." 
07Jdg 13:9 God did what Manoah asked, and his angel came back to the woman while she was sitting in the field. Her husband Manoah was not with her, 
07Jdg 13:10 so she ran at once and told him, "Look! The man who came to me the other day has appeared to me again." 
07Jdg 13:11 Manoah got up and followed his wife. He went to the man and asked, "Are you the man who talked to my wife?" "Yes," he answered. 
07Jdg 13:12 Then Manoah said, "Now then, when your words come true, what must the boy do? What kind of a life must he lead?" 
07Jdg 13:13 The LORD's angel answered, "Your wife must be sure to do everything that I have told her. 
07Jdg 13:14 She must not eat anything that comes from the grapevine; she must not drink any wine or beer, or eat any forbidden food. She must do everything that I have told her." 
07Jdg 13:15 Not knowing that it was the LORD's angel, Manoah said to him, "Please do not go yet. Let us cook a young goat for you." 
07Jdg 13:16 But the angel said, "If I do stay, I will not eat your food. But if you want to prepare it, burn it as an offering to the LORD." 
07Jdg 13:17 Manoah replied, "Tell us your name, so that we can honor you when your words come true." 
07Jdg 13:18 The angel asked, "Why do you want to know my name? It is a name of wonder." 
07Jdg 13:19 So Manoah took a young goat and some grain, and offered them on the rock altar to the LORD who works wonders. 
07Jdg 13:20 While the flames were going up from the altar, Manoah and his wife saw the LORD's angel go up toward heaven in the flames. 
07Jdg 13:21 Manoah realized then that the man had been the LORD's angel, and he and his wife threw themselves face downward on the ground. They never saw the angel again. 
07Jdg 13:22 Manoah said to his wife, "We are sure to die, because we have seen God!" 
07Jdg 13:23 But his wife answered, "If the LORD had wanted to kill us, he would not have accepted our offerings; he would not have shown us all this or told us such things at this time." 
07Jdg 13:24 The woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The child grew and the LORD blessed him. 
07Jdg 13:25 And the LORD's power began to strengthen him while he was between Zorah and Eshtaol in the Camp of Dan. 
07Jdg 14:1 One day Samson went down to Timnah, where he noticed a certain young Philistine woman. 
07Jdg 14:2 He went back home and told his father and mother, "There is a Philistine woman down at Timnah who caught my attention. Get her for me; I want to marry her." 
07Jdg 14:3 But his father and mother asked him, "Why do you have to go to those heathen Philistines to get a wife? Can't you find someone in our own clan, among all our people?" But Samson told his father, "She is the one I want you to get for me. I like her." 
07Jdg 14:4 His parents did not know that it was the LORD who was leading Samson to do this, for the LORD was looking for a chance to fight the Philistines. At this time the Philistines were ruling Israel. 
07Jdg 14:5 So Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother. As they were going through the vineyards there, he heard a young lion roaring. 
07Jdg 14:6 Suddenly the power of the LORD made Samson strong, and he tore the lion apart with his bare hands, as if it were a young goat. But he did not tell his parents what he had done. 
07Jdg 14:7 Then he went and talked to the young woman, and he liked her. 
07Jdg 14:8 A few days later Samson went back to marry her. On the way he left the road to look at the lion he had killed, and he was surprised to find a swarm of bees and some honey inside the dead body. 
07Jdg 14:9 He scraped the honey out into his hands and ate it as he walked along. Then he went to his father and mother and gave them some. They ate it, but Samson did not tell them that he had taken the honey from the dead body of a lion. 
07Jdg 14:10 His father went to the woman's house, and Samson gave a banquet there. This was a custom among the young men. 
07Jdg 14:11 When the Philistines saw him, they sent thirty young men to stay with him. 
07Jdg 14:12 Samson said to them, "Let me tell you a riddle. I'll bet each one of you a piece of fine linen and a change of fine clothes that you can't tell me its meaning before the seven days of the wedding feast are over." 
07Jdg 14:13 "Tell us your riddle," they said. "Let's hear it." 
07Jdg 14:14 He said, "Out of the eater came something to eat; Out of the strong came something sweet." Three days later they had still not figured out what the riddle meant. 
07Jdg 14:15 On the fourth day they said to Samson's wife, "Trick your husband into telling us what the riddle means. If you don't, we'll set fire to your father's house and burn you with it. You two invited us so that you could rob us, didn't you?" 
07Jdg 14:16 So Samson's wife went to him in tears and said, "You don't love me! You just hate me! You told my friends a riddle and didn't tell me what it means!" He said, "Look, I haven't even told my father and mother. Why should I tell you?" 
07Jdg 14:17 She cried about it for the whole seven days of the feast. But on the seventh day he told her what the riddle meant, for she nagged him so about it. Then she told the Philistines. 
07Jdg 14:18 So on the seventh day, before Samson went into the bedroom, the men of the city said to him, "What could be sweeter than honey? What could be stronger than a lion?" Samson replied, "If you hadn't been plowing with my cow, You wouldn't know the answer now." 
07Jdg 14:19 Suddenly the power of the LORD made him strong, and he went down to Ashkelon, where he killed thirty men, stripped them, and gave their fine clothes to the men who had solved the riddle. After that, he went back home, furious about what had happened, 
07Jdg 14:20 and his wife was given to the man that had been his best man at the wedding. 
07Jdg 15:1 Some time later Samson went to visit his wife during the wheat harvest and took her a young goat. He told her father, "I want to go to my wife's room." But he wouldn't let him go in. 
07Jdg 15:2 He told Samson, "I really thought that you hated her, so I gave her to your friend. But her younger sister is prettier, anyway. You can have her, instead." 
07Jdg 15:3 Samson said, "This time I'm not going to be responsible for what I do to the Philistines!" 
07Jdg 15:4 So he went and caught three hundred foxes. Two at a time, he tied their tails together and put torches in the knots. 
07Jdg 15:5 Then he set fire to the torches and turned the foxes loose in the Philistine wheat fields. In this way he burned up not only the wheat that had been harvested but also the wheat that was still in the fields. The olive orchards were also burned. 
07Jdg 15:6 When the Philistines asked who had done this, they learned that Samson had done it because his father-in-law, a man from Timnah, had given Samson's wife to a friend of Samson's. So the Philistines went and burned the woman to death and burned down her father's house. 
07Jdg 15:7 Samson told them, "So this is how you act! I swear that I won't stop until I pay you back!" 
07Jdg 15:8 He attacked them fiercely and killed many of them. Then he went and stayed in the cave in the cliff at Etam. 
07Jdg 15:9 The Philistines came and camped in Judah, and attacked the town of Lehi. 
07Jdg 15:10 The men of Judah asked them, "Why are you attacking us?" They answered, "We came to take Samson prisoner and to treat him as he treated us." 
07Jdg 15:11 So these three thousand men of Judah went to the cave in the cliff at Etam and said to Samson, "Don't you know that the Philistines are our rulers? What have you done to us?" He answered, "I did to them just what they did to me." 
07Jdg 15:12 They told him, "We have come here to tie you up, so we can hand you over to them." Samson said, "Give me your word that you won't kill me yourselves." 
07Jdg 15:13 "All right," they said, "we are only going to tie you up and hand you over to them. We won't kill you." So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him back from the cliff. 
07Jdg 15:14 When he got to Lehi, the Philistines came running toward him, shouting at him. Suddenly the power of the LORD made him strong, and he broke the ropes around his arms and hands as if they were burnt thread. 
07Jdg 15:15 Then he found a jawbone of a donkey that had recently died. He reached down and picked it up, and killed a thousand men with it. 
07Jdg 15:16 So Samson sang, "With the jawbone of a donkey I killed a thousand men; With the jawbone of a donkey I piled them up in piles." 
07Jdg 15:17 After that, he threw the jawbone away. The place where this happened was named Ramath Lehi. 
07Jdg 15:18 Then Samson became very thirsty, so he called to the LORD and said, "You gave me this great victory; am I now going to die of thirst and be captured by these heathen Philistines?" 
07Jdg 15:19 Then God opened a hollow place in the ground there at Lehi, and water came out of it. Samson drank it and began to feel much better. So the spring was named Hakkore; it is still there at Lehi. 
07Jdg 15:20 Samson led Israel for twenty years while the Philistines ruled the land. 
07Jdg 16:1 One day Samson went to the Philistine city of Gaza, where he met a prostitute and went to bed with her. 
07Jdg 16:2 The people of Gaza found out that Samson was there, so they surrounded the place and waited for him all night long at the city gate. They were quiet all night, thinking to themselves, "We'll wait until daybreak, and then we'll kill him." 
07Jdg 16:3 But Samson stayed in bed only until midnight. Then he got up and took hold of the city gate and pulled it up - doors, posts, lock, and all. He put them on his shoulders and carried them far off to the top of the hill overlooking Hebron. 
07Jdg 16:4 After this, Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in Sorek Valley. 
07Jdg 16:5 The five Philistine kings went to her and said, "Trick Samson into telling you why he is so strong and how we can overpower him, tie him up, and make him helpless. Each one of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver." 
07Jdg 16:6 So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me what makes you so strong. If someone wanted to tie you up and make you helpless, how could he do it?" 
07Jdg 16:7 Samson answered, "If they tie me up with seven new bowstrings that are not dried out, I'll be as weak as anybody else." 
07Jdg 16:8 So the Philistine kings brought Delilah seven new bowstrings that were not dried out, and she tied Samson up. 
07Jdg 16:9 She had some men waiting in another room, so she shouted, "Samson! The Philistines are coming!" But he snapped the bowstrings just as thread breaks when fire touches it. So they still did not know the secret of his strength. 
07Jdg 16:10 Delilah told Samson, "Look, you've been making a fool of me and not telling me the truth. Please tell me how someone could tie you up." 
07Jdg 16:11 He told her, "If they tie me with new ropes that have never been used, I'll be as weak as anybody else." 
07Jdg 16:12 So Delilah got some new ropes and tied him up. Then she shouted, "Samson! The Philistines are coming!" The men were waiting in another room. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like thread. 
07Jdg 16:13 Delilah said to Samson, "You're still making a fool of me and not telling me the truth. Tell me how someone could tie you up." He told her, "If you weave my seven locks of hair into a loom, and make it tight with a peg, I'll be as weak as anybody else." 
07Jdg 16:14 Delilah then lulled him to sleep, took his seven locks of hair, and wove them into the loom. She made it tight with a peg and shouted, "Samson! The Philistines are coming!" But he woke up and pulled his hair loose from the loom. 
07Jdg 16:15 So she said to him, "How can you say you love me, when you don't mean it? You've made a fool of me three times, and you still haven't told me what makes you so strong." 
07Jdg 16:16 She kept on asking him, day after day. He got so sick and tired of her bothering him about it 
07Jdg 16:17 that he finally told her the truth. "My hair has never been cut," he said. "I have been dedicated to God as a nazirite from the time I was born. If my hair were cut, I would lose my strength and be as weak as anybody else." 
07Jdg 16:18 When Delilah realized that he had told her the truth, she sent a message to the Philistine kings and said, "Come back one more time. He has told me the truth." Then they came and brought the money with them. 
07Jdg 16:19 Delilah lulled Samson to sleep in her lap and then called a man, who cut off Samson's seven locks of hair. Then she began to torment him, for he had lost his strength. 
07Jdg 16:20 Then she shouted, "Samson! The Philistines are coming!" He woke up and thought, "I'll get loose and go free, as always." He did not know that the LORD had left him. 
07Jdg 16:21 The Philistines captured him and put his eyes out. They took him to Gaza, chained him with bronze chains, and put him to work grinding at the mill in the prison. 
07Jdg 16:22 But his hair started growing back. 
07Jdg 16:23 The Philistine kings met together to celebrate and offer a great sacrifice to their god Dagon. They sang, "Our god has given us victory over our enemy Samson!" 
07Jdg 16:24 They were enjoying themselves, and so they said, "Call Samson, and let's make him entertain us!" When they brought Samson out of the prison, they made him entertain them and made him stand between the columns. 
07Jdg 16:25 When the people saw him, they sang praise to their god: "Our god has given us victory over our enemy, who devastated our land and killed so many of us!" 
07Jdg 16:26 Samson said to the boy who was leading him by the hand, "Let me touch the columns that hold up the building. I want to lean on them." 
07Jdg 16:27 The building was crowded with men and women. All five Philistine kings were there, and there were about three thousand men and women on the roof, watching Samson entertain them. 
07Jdg 16:28 Then Samson prayed, "Sovereign LORD, please remember me; please, God, give me my strength just this one time more, so that with this one blow I can get even with the Philistines for putting out my two eyes." 
07Jdg 16:29 So Samson took hold of the two middle columns holding up the building. Putting one hand on each column, he pushed against them 
07Jdg 16:30 and shouted, "Let me die with the Philistines!" He pushed with all his might, and the building fell down on the five kings and everyone else. Samson killed more people at his death than he had killed during his life. 
07Jdg 16:31 His brothers and the rest of his family came down to get his body. They took him back and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of his father Manoah. He had been Israel's leader for twenty years. 
07Jdg 17:1 There was once a man named Micah, who lived in the hill country of Ephraim. 
07Jdg 17:2 He told his mother, "When someone stole those eleven hundred pieces of silver from you, you put a curse on the robber. I heard you do it. Look, I have the money. I am the one who took it." His mother said, "May the LORD bless you, my son!" 
07Jdg 17:3 He gave the money back to his mother, and she said, "To keep the curse from falling on my son, I myself am solemnly dedicating the silver to the LORD. It will be used to make a wooden idol covered with silver. So now I will give the pieces of silver back to you." 
07Jdg 17:4 Then he gave them back to his mother. She took two hundred of the pieces of silver and gave them to a metalworker, who made an idol, carving it from wood and covering it with the silver. It was placed in Micah's house. 
07Jdg 17:5 This man Micah had his own place of worship. He made some idols and an ephod, and appointed one of his sons as his priest. 
07Jdg 17:6 There was no king in Israel at that time; everyone did whatever they wanted. 
07Jdg 17:7 At that same time there was a young Levite who had been living in the town of Bethlehem in Judah. 
07Jdg 17:8 He left Bethlehem to find another place to live. While he was traveling, he came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim. 
07Jdg 17:9 Micah asked him, "Where do you come from?" He answered, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah. I am looking for a place to live." 
07Jdg 17:10 Micah said, "Stay with me. Be my adviser and priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year, some clothes, and your food." 
07Jdg 17:11 The young Levite agreed to stay with Micah and became like a son to him. 
07Jdg 17:12 Micah appointed him as his priest, and he lived in Micah's home. 
07Jdg 17:13 Micah said, "Now that I have a Levite as my priest, I know that the LORD will make things go well for me." 
07Jdg 18:1 There was no king in Israel at that time. In those days the tribe of Dan was looking for territory to claim and settle in because they had not yet received any land of their own among the tribes of Israel. 
07Jdg 18:2 So the people of Dan chose five qualified men out of all the families in the tribe and sent them from the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol with instructions to explore the land and spy on it. When they arrived in the hill country of Ephraim, they stayed at Micah's house. 
07Jdg 18:3 While they were there, they recognized the accent of the young Levite, so they went up to him and asked, "What are you doing here? Who brought you here?" 
07Jdg 18:4 He answered, "I have an arrangement with Micah, who pays me to serve as his priest." 
07Jdg 18:5 They said to him, "Please ask God if we are going to be successful on our trip." 
07Jdg 18:6 The priest answered, "You have nothing to worry about. The LORD is taking care of you on this trip." 
07Jdg 18:7 So the five men left and went to the town of Laish. They saw how the people there lived in security like the Sidonians. They were a peaceful, quiet people, with no argument with anyone; they had all they needed. They lived far away from the Sidonians and had no dealings with any other people. 
07Jdg 18:8 When the five men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, the people asked them what they had found out. 
07Jdg 18:9 "Come on," they replied. "Let's attack Laish. We saw the land, and it's very good. Don't stay here doing nothing; hurry! Go on in and take it over! 
07Jdg 18:10 When you get there, you will find that the people don't suspect a thing. It is a big country; it has everything a person could want, and God has given it to you." 
07Jdg 18:11 So six hundred men from the tribe of Dan left Zorah and Eshtaol, ready for battle. 
07Jdg 18:12 They went up and camped west of Kiriath Jearim in Judah. That is why the place is still called Camp of Dan. 
07Jdg 18:13 They went on from there and came to Micah's house in the hill country of Ephraim. 
07Jdg 18:14 Then the five men who had gone to spy on the country around Laish said to their companions, "Did you know that here in one of these houses there is a wooden idol covered with silver? There are also other idols and an ephod. What do you think we should do?" 
07Jdg 18:15 So they went into Micah's house, where the young Levite lived, and asked the Levite how he was getting along. 
07Jdg 18:16 Meanwhile the six hundred Danite soldiers, ready for battle, were standing at the gate. 
07Jdg 18:17 The five spies went straight on into the house and took the wooden idol covered with silver, the other idols, and the ephod, while the priest stayed at the gate with the six hundred armed men. 
07Jdg 18:18 When the men went into Micah's house and took the sacred objects, the priest asked them, "What are you doing?" 
07Jdg 18:19 They told him, "Keep quiet. Don't say a word. Come with us and be our priest and adviser. Wouldn't you rather be a priest for a whole Israelite tribe than for the family of one man?" 
07Jdg 18:20 This made the priest very happy, so he took the sacred objects and went along with them. 
07Jdg 18:21 They turned around and started off, with their children, their livestock, and their belongings going ahead. 
07Jdg 18:22 They had traveled a good distance from the house when Micah called his neighbors out for battle. They caught up with the Danites 
07Jdg 18:23 and shouted at them. The Danites turned around and asked Micah, "What's the matter? Why all this mob?" 
07Jdg 18:24 Micah answered, "What do you mean, 'What's the matter?' You take my priest and the gods that I made, and walk off ! What have I got left?" 
07Jdg 18:25 The Danites told him, "You had better not say anything else unless you want these men to get angry and attack you. You and your whole family would die." 
07Jdg 18:26 Then the Danites went on. Micah saw that they were too strong for him, so he turned and went back home. 
07Jdg 18:27 After the Danites had taken the priest and the things that Micah had made, they went and attacked Laish, that town of peaceful, quiet people which was in the same valley as Bethrehob. 
07Jdg 18:28 They killed the inhabitants and burned the town. There was no one to save them, because Laish was a long way from Sidon, and they had no dealings with any other people. The Danites rebuilt the town and settled down there. 
07Jdg 18:29 They changed its name from Laish to Dan, after their ancestor Dan, the son of Jacob. 
07Jdg 18:30 The Danites set up the idol to be worshiped, and Jonathan, the son of Gershom and grandson of Moses, served as a priest for the Danites, and his descendants served as their priests until the people were taken away into exile. 
07Jdg 18:31 Micah's idol remained there as long as the Tent where God was worshiped remained at Shiloh. 
07Jdg 19:1 In those days before Israel had a king, there was a Levite living far back in the hill country of Ephraim. He took a young woman from Bethlehem in Judah to be his concubine. 
07Jdg 19:2 But she became angry with him, went back to her father's house in Bethlehem, and stayed there four months. 
07Jdg 19:3 Then the man decided to go after her and try to persuade her to return to him. He took his servant and two donkeys with him. The woman showed the Levite into the house, and when her father saw him, he gave him a hearty greeting. 
07Jdg 19:4 The father insisted that he stay, and so he stayed for three days. The couple had their meals and spent the nights there. 
07Jdg 19:5 On the morning of the fourth day they woke up early and got ready to go. But the woman's father said to the Levite, "Have something to eat first. You'll feel better. You can go later." 
07Jdg 19:6 So the two men sat down and ate and drank together. Then the woman's father told him, "Please spend the night and enjoy yourself." 
07Jdg 19:7 The Levite got up to go, but the father urged him to stay, so he spent another night there. 
07Jdg 19:8 Early in the morning of the fifth day he started to leave, but the woman's father said, "Eat something, please. Wait until later in the day." So the two men ate together. 
07Jdg 19:9 When the man, his concubine, and the servant once more started to leave, the father said, "Look, it's almost evening now; you might as well stay all night. It will be dark soon; stay here and have a good time. Tomorrow you can get up early for the trip and go home." 
07Jdg 19:10 But the man did not want to spend another night there, so he and his concubine started on their way, with their servant and two donkeys with pack saddles. 
07Jdg 19:11 It was late in the day when they came near Jebus (that is, Jerusalem), so the servant said to his master, "Why don't we stop and spend the night here in this Jebusite city?" 
07Jdg 19:12 But his master said, "We're not going to stop in a city where the people are not Israelites. 
07Jdg 19:13 We'll pass on by and go a little farther and spend the night at Gibeah or Ramah."
07Jdg 19:14 So they passed by Jebus and continued on their way. It was sunset when they came to Gibeah in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. 
07Jdg 19:15 They turned off the road to go and spend the night there. They went into town and sat down in the city square, but no one offered to take them home for the night. 
07Jdg 19:16 While they were there, an old man came by at the end of a day's work on the farm. He was originally from the hill country of Ephraim, but he was now living in Gibeah. (The other people there were from the tribe of Benjamin.) 
07Jdg 19:17 The old man noticed the traveler in the city square and asked him, "Where do you come from? Where are you going?" 
07Jdg 19:18 The Levite answered, "We have been in Bethlehem in Judah, and now we are on our way home deep in the hill country of Ephraim. No one will put us up for the night, 
07Jdg 19:19 even though we have fodder and straw for our donkeys, as well as bread and wine for my concubine and me and for my servant. We have everything we need." 
07Jdg 19:20 The old man said, "You are welcome in my home! I'll take care of you; you don't have to spend the night in the square." 
07Jdg 19:21 So he took them home with him and fed their donkeys. His guests washed their feet and had a meal. 
07Jdg 19:22 They were enjoying themselves when all of a sudden some sexual perverts from the town surrounded the house and started beating on the door. They said to the old man, "Bring out that man that came home with you! We want to have sex with him!" 
07Jdg 19:23 But the old man went outside and said to them, "No, my friends! Please! Don't do such an evil, immoral thing! This man is my guest. 
07Jdg 19:24 Look! Here is his concubine and my own virgin daughter. I'll bring them out now, and you can have them. Do whatever you want to with them. But don't do such an awful thing to this man!" 
07Jdg 19:25 But the men would not listen to him. So the Levite took his concubine and put her outside with them. They raped her and abused her all night long and didn't stop until morning. 
07Jdg 19:26 At dawn the woman came and fell down at the door of the old man's house, where her husband was. She was still there when daylight came. 
07Jdg 19:27 Her husband got up that morning, and when he opened the door to go on his way, he found his concubine lying in front of the house with her hands reaching for the door. 
07Jdg 19:28 He said, "Get up. Let's go." But there was no answer. So he put her body across the donkey and started on his way home. 
07Jdg 19:29 When he arrived, he went in the house and got a knife. He took his concubine's body, cut it into twelve pieces, and sent one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel. 
07Jdg 19:30 Everyone who saw it said, "We have never heard of such a thing! Nothing like this has ever happened since the Israelites left Egypt! We have to do something about this! What will it be?" 
07Jdg 20:1 All the people of Israel from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, as well as from the land of Gilead in the east, answered the call. They gathered in one body in the LORD's presence at Mizpah. 
07Jdg 20:2 The leaders of all the tribes of Israel were present at this gathering of God's people, and there were 400,000 foot soldiers. 
07Jdg 20:3 Meanwhile the people of Benjamin heard that all the other Israelites had gathered at Mizpah. The Israelites asked, "Tell us, how was this crime committed?" 
07Jdg 20:4 The Levite whose concubine had been murdered answered, "My concubine and I went to Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin to spend the night. 
07Jdg 20:5 The men of Gibeah came to get me and surrounded the house at night. They intended to kill me; instead they raped my concubine, and she died. 
07Jdg 20:6 I took her body, cut it in pieces, and sent one piece to each of the twelve tribes of Israel. These people have committed an evil and immoral act among us. 
07Jdg 20:7 All of you here are Israelites. What are we going to do about this?" 
07Jdg 20:8 All the people stood up together and said, "None of us, whether he lives in a tent or in a house, will go home. 
07Jdg 20:9 This is what we will do: we will draw lots and choose some men to attack Gibeah. 
07Jdg 20:10 One tenth of the men in Israel will provide food for the army, and the others will go and punish Gibeah for this immoral act that they have committed in Israel." 
07Jdg 20:11 So all the men in Israel assembled with one purpose - to attack the town. 
07Jdg 20:12 The Israelite tribes sent messengers all through the territory of the tribe of Benjamin to say, "What is this crime that you have committed? 
07Jdg 20:13 Now hand over those perverts in Gibeah, so that we can kill them and remove this evil from Israel." But the people of Benjamin paid no attention to the other Israelites. 
07Jdg 20:14 From all the cities of Benjamin they came to Gibeah to fight the other people of Israel. 
07Jdg 20:15 They called out twenty-six thousand soldiers from their cities that day. 
07Jdg 20:16 Besides these, the citizens of Gibeah gathered seven hundred specially chosen men who were left-handed. Every one of them could sling a stone at a strand of hair and never miss. 
07Jdg 20:17 Not counting the tribe of Benjamin, the Israelites gathered 400,000 trained soldiers. 
07Jdg 20:18 The Israelites went to the place of worship at Bethel, and there they asked God, "Which tribe should attack the Benjaminites first?" The LORD answered, "The tribe of Judah." 
07Jdg 20:19 So the Israelites started out the next morning and camped near the city of Gibeah. 
07Jdg 20:20 They went to attack the army of Benjamin, and placed the soldiers in position facing the city. 
07Jdg 20:21 The army of Benjamin came out of the city, and before the day was over they had killed twenty-two thousand Israelite soldiers. 
07Jdg 20:22 Then the Israelites went to the place of worship and mourned in the presence of the LORD until evening. They asked him, "Should we go again into battle against our brothers the Benjaminites?" 
07Jdg 20:23 The LORD answered, "Yes." So the Israelite army was encouraged, and they placed their soldiers in position again, where they had been the day before. 
07Jdg 20:24 They marched against the army of Benjamin a second time. 
07Jdg 20:25 And for the second time the Benjaminites came out of Gibeah, and this time they killed eighteen thousand trained Israelite soldiers. 
07Jdg 20:26 Then all the people of Israel went up to Bethel and mourned. They sat there in the LORD's presence and did not eat until evening. They offered fellowship sacrifices and burned some sacrifices whole - all in the presence of the LORD. 
07Jdg 20:27 God's Covenant Box was there at Bethel in those days, and Phinehas, the son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron, was in charge of it. 
07Jdg 20:28 The people asked the LORD, "Should we go out to fight our brothers the Benjaminites again, or should we give up?" The LORD answered, "Fight. Tomorrow I will give you victory over them." 
07Jdg 20:29 So the Israelites put some soldiers in hiding around Gibeah. 
07Jdg 20:30 Then for the third straight day they marched against the army of Benjamin and placed their soldiers in battle position facing Gibeah, as they had done before. 
07Jdg 20:31 The Benjaminites came out to fight and were led away from the city. As they had before, they began killing some Israelites in the open country, on the road to Bethel and on the road to Gibeah. They killed about thirty Israelites. 
07Jdg 20:32 The Benjaminites said, "We've beaten them just as before." But the Israelites had planned to retreat and lead them away from the city onto the roads. 
07Jdg 20:33 So when the main army of the Israelites pulled back and regrouped at Baaltamar, the men surrounding Gibeah suddenly rushed out of their hiding places in the rocky country around the city. 
07Jdg 20:34 Ten thousand men, specially chosen out of all Israel, attacked Gibeah, and the fighting was hard. The Benjaminites had not realized that they were about to be destroyed. 
07Jdg 20:35 The LORD gave Israel victory over the army of Benjamin. The Israelites killed 25,100 of the enemy that day, 
07Jdg 20:36 and the Benjaminites realized they were defeated. The main body of the Israelite army had retreated from the Benjaminites because they were relying on the men that they had put in hiding around Gibeah. 
07Jdg 20:37 These men ran quickly toward Gibeah; they spread out in the city and killed everyone there. 
07Jdg 20:38 The main Israelite army and the men in hiding had arranged a signal. When they saw a big cloud of smoke going up from the town, 
07Jdg 20:39 the Israelites out on the battlefield were to turn around. By this time the Benjaminites had already killed the thirty Israelites. They told themselves, "Yes, we've beaten them just as before." 
07Jdg 20:40 Then the signal appeared; a cloud of smoke began to go up from the town. The Benjaminites looked behind them and were amazed to see the whole city going up in flames. 
07Jdg 20:41 Then the Israelites turned around, and the Benjaminites were thrown into panic because they realized that they were about to be destroyed. 
07Jdg 20:42 They retreated from the Israelites and ran toward the open country, but they could not escape. They were caught between the main army and the men who were now coming out of the city, and they were destroyed. 
07Jdg 20:43 The Israelites had the enemy trapped, and without stopping they pursued them as far as a point east of Gibeah, killing them as they went. 
07Jdg 20:44 Eighteen thousand of the best Benjaminite soldiers were killed. 
07Jdg 20:45 The others turned and ran toward the open country to Rimmon Rock. Five thousand of them were killed on the roads. The Israelites continued to pursue the rest to Gidom, killing two thousand. 
07Jdg 20:46 In all, twenty-five thousand Benjaminites were killed that day - all of them brave soldiers. 
07Jdg 20:47 But six hundred men were able to escape to the open country to Rimmon Rock, and they stayed there four months. 
07Jdg 20:48 The Israelites turned back against the rest of the Benjaminites and killed them all - men, women, and children, and animals as well. They burned every town in the area. 
07Jdg 21:1 When the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, they had made a solemn promise to the LORD: "None of us will allow a Benjaminite to marry a daughter of ours." 
07Jdg 21:2 So now the people of Israel went to Bethel and sat there in the presence of God until evening. Loudly and bitterly they mourned�� 07Jdg 21:3 " LORD God of Israel, why has this happened? Why is the tribe of Benjamin about to disappear from Israel?" 
07Jdg 21:4 Early the next morning the people got up and built an altar there. They offered fellowship sacrifices and burned some sacrifices whole. 
07Jdg 21:5 They asked, "Is there any group out of all the tribes of Israel that did not go to the gathering in the LORD's presence at Mizpah?" (They had taken a solemn oath that anyone who had not gone to Mizpah would be put to death.) 
07Jdg 21:6 The people of Israel felt sorry for their brothers the Benjaminites and said, "Today Israel has lost one of its tribes. 
07Jdg 21:7 What shall we do to provide wives for the men of Benjamin who are left? We have made a solemn promise to the LORD that we will not give them any of our daughters." 
07Jdg 21:8 When they asked if there was some group out of the tribes of Israel that had not gone to the gathering at Mizpah, they found out that no one from Jabesh in Gilead had been there; 
07Jdg 21:9 at the roll call of the army no one from Jabesh had responded. 
07Jdg 21:10 So the assembly sent twelve thousand of their bravest men with the orders, "Go and kill everyone in Jabesh, including women and children. 
07Jdg 21:11 Kill all the males, and also every woman who is not a virgin." 
07Jdg 21:12 They found four hundred young virgins among the people in Jabesh, so they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. 
07Jdg 21:13 Then the whole assembly sent word to the Benjaminites who were at Rimmon Rock and offered to end the war. 
07Jdg 21:14 The Benjaminites came back, and the other Israelites gave them the young women from Jabesh whom they had not killed. But there were not enough of them. 
07Jdg 21:15 The people felt sorry for the Benjaminites because the LORD had broken the unity of the tribes of Israel. 
07Jdg 21:16 So the leaders of the gathering said, "There are no more women in the tribe of Benjamin. What shall we do to provide wives for the men who are left? 
07Jdg 21:17 Israel must not lose one of its twelve tribes. We must find a way for the tribe of Benjamin to survive, 
07Jdg 21:18 but we cannot allow them to marry our daughters, because we have put a curse on anyone who allows a Benjaminite to marry one of our daughters." 
07Jdg 21:19 Then they thought, "The yearly festival of the LORD at Shiloh is coming soon." (Shiloh is north of Bethel, south of Lebonah, and east of the road between Bethel and Shechem.) 
07Jdg 21:20 They told the Benjaminites, "Go and hide in the vineyards 
07Jdg 21:21 and watch. When the young women of Shiloh come out to dance during the festival, you come out of the vineyards. Each of you take a wife by force from among them and take her back to the territory of Benjamin with you. 
07Jdg 21:22 If their fathers or brothers come to you and protest, you can tell them, 'Please let us keep them, because we did not take them from you in battle to be our wives. And since you did not give them to us, you are not guilty of breaking your promise.' " 
07Jdg 21:23 The Benjaminites did this; each of them chose a wife from the young women who were dancing at Shiloh and carried her away. Then they went back to their own territory, rebuilt their towns, and lived there. 
07Jdg 21:24 At the same time the rest of the Israelites left, and every man went back to his own tribe and family and to his own property. 
07Jdg 21:25 There was no king in Israel at that time. Everyone did whatever they pleased. 
08
08Ru 1:1 Long ago, in the days before Israel had a king, there was a famine in the land. 
08Ru 1:2 So a man named Elimelech, who belonged to the clan of Ephrath and who lived in Bethlehem in Judah, went with his wife Naomi and their two sons Mahlon and Chilion to live for a while in the country of Moab. While they were living there,
08Ru 1:3 Elimelech died, and Naomi was left alone with her two sons, 
08Ru 1:4 who married Moabite women, Orpah and Ruth. About ten years later 
08Ru 1:5 Mahlon and Chilion also died, and Naomi was left all alone, without husband or sons. 
08Ru 1:6 Some time later Naomi heard that the LORD had blessed his people by giving them good crops; so she got ready to leave Moab with her daughters-in-law. 
08Ru 1:7 They started out together to go back to Judah, but on the way 
08Ru 1:8 she said to them, "Go back home and stay with your mothers. May the LORD be as good to you as you have been to me and to those who have died. 
08Ru 1:9 And may the LORD make it possible for each of you to marry again and have a home." So Naomi kissed them good-bye. But they started crying 
08Ru 1:10 and said to her, "No! We will go with you to your people." 
08Ru 1:11 "You must go back, my daughters," Naomi answered. "Why do you want to come with me? Do you think I could have sons again for you to marry? 
08Ru 1:12 Go back home, for I am too old to get married again. Even if I thought there was still hope, and so got married tonight and had sons, 
08Ru 1:13 would you wait until they had grown up? Would this keep you from marrying someone else? No, my daughters, you know that's impossible. The LORD has turned against me, and I feel very sorry for you." 
08Ru 1:14 Again they started crying. Then Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-bye and went back home, but Ruth held on to her. 
08Ru 1:15 So Naomi said to her, "Ruth, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her god. Go back home with her." 
08Ru 1:16 But Ruth answered, "Don't ask me to leave you! Let me go with you. Wherever you go, I will go; wherever you live, I will live. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God. 
08Ru 1:17 Wherever you die, I will die, and that is where I will be buried. May the LORD's worst punishment come upon me if I let anything but death separate me from you!" 
08Ru 1:18 When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she said nothing more. 
08Ru 1:19 They went on until they came to Bethlehem. When they arrived, the whole town became excited, and the women there exclaimed, "Is this really Naomi?" 
08Ru 1:20 "Don't call me Naomi," she answered; "call me Marah, because Almighty God has made my life bitter. 
08Ru 1:21 When I left here, I had plenty, but the LORD has brought me back without a thing. Why call me Naomi when the LORD Almighty has condemned me and sent me trouble?" 
08Ru 1:22 This, then, was how Naomi came back from Moab with Ruth, her Moabite daughter-in-law. When they arrived in Bethlehem, the barley harvest was just beginning. 
08Ru 2:1 Naomi had a relative named Boaz, a rich and influential man who belonged to the family of her husband Elimelech. 
08Ru 2:2 One day Ruth said to Naomi, "Let me go to the fields to gather the grain that the harvest workers leave. I am sure to find someone who will let me work with him." Naomi answered, "Go ahead, daughter." 
08Ru 2:3 So Ruth went out to the fields and walked behind the workers, picking up the heads of grain which they left. It so happened that she was in a field that belonged to Boaz. 
08Ru 2:4 Some time later Boaz himself arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the workers. "The LORD be with you!" he said. "The LORD bless you!" they answered. 
08Ru 2:5 Boaz asked the man in charge, "Who is that young woman?" 
08Ru 2:6 The man answered, "She is the foreigner who came back from Moab with Naomi. 
08Ru 2:7 She asked me to let her follow the workers and gather grain. She has been working since early morning and has just now stopped to rest for a while under the shelter." 
08Ru 2:8 Then Boaz said to Ruth, "Let me give you some advice. Don't gather grain anywhere except in this field. Work with the women here; 
08Ru 2:9 watch them to see where they are reaping and stay with them. I have ordered my men not to molest you. And whenever you are thirsty, go and drink from the water jars that they have filled." 
08Ru 2:10 Ruth bowed down with her face touching the ground, and said to Boaz, "Why should you be so concerned about me? Why should you be so kind to a foreigner?" 
08Ru 2:11 Boaz answered, "I have heard about everything that you have done for your mother-in-law since your husband died. I know how you left your father and mother and your own country and how you came to live among a people you had never known before. 
08Ru 2:12 May the LORD reward you for what you have done. May you have a full reward from the LORD God of Israel, to whom you have come for protection!" 
08Ru 2:13 Ruth answered, "You are very kind to me, sir. You have made me feel better by speaking gently to me, even though I am not the equal of one of your servants." 
08Ru 2:14 At mealtime Boaz said to Ruth, "Come and have a piece of bread, and dip it in the sauce." So she sat with the workers, and Boaz passed some roasted grain to her. She ate until she was satisfied, and she still had some food left over. 
08Ru 2:15 After she had left to go and gather grain, Boaz ordered the workers, "Let her gather grain even where the bundles are lying, and don't say anything to stop her. 
08Ru 2:16 Besides that, pull out some heads of grain from the bundles and leave them for her to pick up." 
08Ru 2:17 So Ruth gathered grain in the field until evening, and when she had beaten it out, she found she had nearly twenty-five pounds. 
08Ru 2:18 She took the grain back into town and showed her mother-in-law how much she had gathered. She also gave her the food left over from the meal. 
08Ru 2:19 Naomi asked her, "Where did you gather all this grain today? Whose field have you been working in? May God bless the man who took an interest in you!" So Ruth told Naomi that she had been working in a field belonging to a man named Boaz. 
08Ru 2:20 "May the LORD bless Boaz!" Naomi exclaimed. "The LORD always keeps his promises to the living and the dead." And she went on, "That man is a close relative of ours, one of those responsible for taking care of us." 
08Ru 2:21 Then Ruth said, "Best of all, he told me to keep gathering grain with his workers until they finish the harvest." 
08Ru 2:22 Naomi said to Ruth, "Yes, daughter, it will be better for you to work with the women in Boaz' field. You might be molested if you went to someone else's field." 
08Ru 2:23 So Ruth worked with them and gathered grain until all the barley and wheat had been harvested. And she continued to live with her mother-in-law. 
08Ru 3:1 Some time later Naomi said to Ruth, "I must find a husband for you, so that you will have a home of your own. 
08Ru 3:2 Remember that this man Boaz, whose women you have been working with, is our relative. Now listen. This evening he will be threshing the barley. 
08Ru 3:3 So wash yourself, put on some perfume, and get dressed in your best clothes. Then go where he is threshing, but don't let him know you are there until he has finished eating and drinking. 
08Ru 3:4 Be sure to notice where he lies down, and after he falls asleep, go and lift the covers and lie down at his feet. He will tell you what to do." 
08Ru 3:5 Ruth answered, "I will do everything you say." 
08Ru 3:6 So Ruth went to the threshing place and did just what her mother-in-law had told her. 
08Ru 3:7 When Boaz had finished eating and drinking, he was in a good mood. He went to the pile of barley and lay down to sleep. Ruth slipped over quietly, lifted the covers and lay down at his feet. 
08Ru 3:8 During the night he woke up suddenly, turned over, and was surprised to find a woman lying at his feet. 
08Ru 3:9 "Who are you?" he asked. "It's Ruth, sir," she answered. "Because you are a close relative, you are responsible for taking care of me. So please marry me." 
08Ru 3:10 "The LORD bless you," he said. "You are showing even greater family loyalty in what you are doing now than in what you did for your mother-in-law. You might have gone looking for a young man, either rich or poor, but you haven't. 
08Ru 3:11 Now don't worry, Ruth. I will do everything you ask; as everyone in town knows, you are a fine woman. 
08Ru 3:12 It is true that I am a close relative and am responsible for you, but there is a man who is a closer relative than I am. 
08Ru 3:13 Stay here the rest of the night, and in the morning we will find out whether or not he will take responsibility for you. If so, well and good; if not, then I swear by the living LORD that I will take the responsibility. Now lie down and stay here till morning." 
08Ru 3:14 So she lay there at his feet, but she got up before it was light enough for her to be seen, because Boaz did not want anyone to know that she had been there. 
08Ru 3:15 Boaz said to her, "Take off your cloak and spread it out here." She did, and he poured out almost fifty pounds of barley and helped her lift it to her shoulder. Then she returned to town with it. 
08Ru 3:16 When she arrived home, her mother-in-law asked her, "How did you get along, daughter?" Ruth told her everything that Boaz had done for her. 
08Ru 3:17 She added, "He told me I must not come back to you empty-handed, so he gave me all this barley." 
08Ru 3:18 Naomi said to her, "Now be patient, Ruth, until you see how this all turns out. Boaz will not rest today until he settles the matter." 
08Ru 4:1 Boaz went to the meeting place at the town gate and sat down there. Then Elimelech's nearest relative, the man whom Boaz had mentioned, came by, and Boaz called to him, "Come over here, my friend, and sit down." So he went over and sat down. 
08Ru 4:2 Then Boaz got ten of the leaders of the town and asked them to sit down there too. When they were seated, 
08Ru 4:3 he said to his relative, "Now that Naomi has come back from Moab, she wants to sell the field that belonged to our relative Elimelech, 
08Ru 4:4 and I think you ought to know about it. Now then, if you want it, buy it in the presence of these men sitting here. But if you don't want it, say so, because the right to buy it belongs first to you and then to me." The man said, "I will buy it." 
08Ru 4:5 Boaz said, "Very well, if you buy the field from Naomi, then you are also buying Ruth, the Moabite widow, so that the field will stay in the dead man's family." 
08Ru 4:6 The man answered, "In that case I will give up my right to buy the field, because it would mean that my own children would not inherit it. You buy it; I would rather not." 
08Ru 4:7 Now in those days, to settle a sale or an exchange of property, it was the custom for the seller to take off his sandal and give it to the buyer. In this way the Israelites showed that the matter was settled. 
08Ru 4:8 So when the man said to Boaz, "You buy it," he took off his sandal and gave it to Boaz. 
08Ru 4:9 Then Boaz said to the leaders and all the others there, "You are all witnesses today that I have bought from Naomi everything that belonged to Elimelech and to his sons Chilion and Mahlon. 
08Ru 4:10 In addition, Ruth the Moabite, Mahlon's widow, becomes my wife. This will keep the property in the dead man's family, and his family line will continue among his people and in his hometown. You are witnesses to this today." 
08Ru 4:11 The leaders and the others said, "Yes, we are witnesses. May the LORD make your wife become like Rachel and Leah, who bore many children to Jacob. May you become rich in the clan of Ephrath and famous in Bethlehem. 
08Ru 4:12 May the children that the LORD will give you by this young woman make your family like the family of Perez, the son of Judah and Tamar." 
08Ru 4:13 So Boaz took Ruth home as his wife. The LORD blessed her, and she became pregnant and had a son. 
08Ru 4:14 The women said to Naomi, "Praise the LORD! He has given you a grandson today to take care of you. May the boy become famous in Israel! 
08Ru 4:15 Your daughter-in-law loves you, and has done more for you than seven sons. And now she has given you a grandson, who will bring new life to you and give you security in your old age." 
08Ru 4:16 Naomi took the child, held him close, and took care of him. 
08Ru 4:17 The women of the neighborhood named the boy Obed. They told everyone, "A son has been born to Naomi!" Obed became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David. 
08Ru 4:18 This is the family line from Perez to David: 
08Ru 4:19 Perez, Hezron, Ram, 
08Ru 4:20 Amminadab, Nahshon, 
08Ru 4:21 Salmon, Boaz, 
08Ru 4:22 Obed, Jesse, David.

091Sm 1:1 There was a man named Elkanah, from the tribe of Ephraim, who lived in the town of Ramah in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham and grandson of Elihu, and belonged to the family of Tohu, a part of the clan of Zuph. 
091Sm 1:2 Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not. 
091Sm 1:3 Every year Elkanah went from Ramah to worship and offer sacrifices to the LORD Almighty at Shiloh, where Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests of the LORD. 
091Sm 1:4 Each time Elkanah offered his sacrifice, he would give one share of the meat to Peninnah and one share to each of her children. 
091Sm 1:5 And even though he loved Hannah very much he would give her only one share, because the LORD had kept her from having children. 
091Sm 1:6 Peninnah, her rival, would torment and humiliate her, because the LORD had kept her childless. 
091Sm 1:7 This went on year after year; whenever they went to the house of the LORD, Peninnah would upset Hannah so much that she would cry and refuse to eat anything. 
091Sm 1:8 Her husband Elkanah would ask her, "Hannah, why are you crying? Why won't you eat? Why are you always so sad? Don't I mean more to you than ten sons?" 
091Sm 1:9 One time, after they had finished their meal in the house of the LORD at Shiloh, Hannah got up. She was deeply distressed, and she cried bitterly as she prayed to the LORD. Meanwhile, Eli the priest was sitting in his place by the door. 
091Sm 1:10 (SEE 1:9)
091Sm 1:11 Hannah made a solemn promise: " LORD Almighty, look at me, your servant! See my trouble and remember me! Don't forget me! If you give me a son, I promise that I will dedicate him to you for his whole life and that he will never have his hair cut." 
091Sm 1:12 Hannah continued to pray to the LORD for a long time, and Eli watched her lips. 
091Sm 1:13 She was praying silently; her lips were moving, but she made no sound. So Eli thought that she was drunk, 
091Sm 1:14 and he said to her, "Stop making a drunken show of yourself ! Stop your drinking and sober up!" 
091Sm 1:15 "No, I'm not drunk, sir," she answered. "I haven't been drinking! I am desperate, and I have been praying, pouring out my troubles to the LORD. 
091Sm 1:16 Don't think I am a worthless woman. I have been praying like this because I'm so miserable." 
091Sm 1:17 "Go in peace," Eli said, "and may the God of Israel give you what you have asked him for." 
091Sm 1:18 "May you always think kindly of me," she replied. Then she went away, ate some food, and was no longer sad. 
091Sm 1:19 The next morning Elkanah and his family got up early, and after worshiping the LORD, they went back home to Ramah. Elkanah had intercourse with his wife Hannah, and the LORD answered her prayer. 
091Sm 1:20 So it was that she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel, and explained, "I asked the LORD for him." 
091Sm 1:21 The time came again for Elkanah and his family to go to Shiloh and offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and the special sacrifice he had promised. 
091Sm 1:22 But this time Hannah did not go. She told her husband, "As soon as the child is weaned, I will take him to the house of the LORD, where he will stay all his life." 
091Sm 1:23 Elkanah answered, "All right, do whatever you think best; stay at home until you have weaned him. And may the LORD make your promise come true." So Hannah stayed at home and nursed her child. 
091Sm 1:24 After she had weaned him, she took him to Shiloh, taking along a three-year-old bull, a bushel of flour, and a leather bag full of wine. She took Samuel, young as he was, to the house of the LORD at Shiloh. 
091Sm 1:25 After they had killed the bull, they took the child to Eli. 
091Sm 1:26 Hannah said to him, "Excuse me, sir. Do you remember me? I am the woman you saw standing here, praying to the LORD. 
091Sm 1:27 I asked him for this child, and he gave me what I asked for. 
091Sm 1:28 So I am dedicating him to the LORD. As long as he lives, he will belong to the LORD." Then they worshiped the LORD there. 
091Sm 2:1 Hannah prayed: "The LORD has filled my heart with joy; how happy I am because of what he has done! I laugh at my enemies; how joyful I am because God has helped me! 
091Sm 2:2 "No one is holy like the LORD; there is none like him, no protector like our God. 
091Sm 2:3 Stop your loud boasting; silence your proud words. For the LORD is a God who knows, and he judges all that people do. 
091Sm 2:4 The bows of strong soldiers are broken, but the weak grow strong. 
091Sm 2:5 The people who once were well fed now hire themselves out to get food, but the hungry are hungry no more. The childless wife has borne seven children, but the mother of many is left with none. 
091Sm 2:6 The LORD kills and restores to life; he sends people to the world of the dead and brings them back again. 
091Sm 2:7 He makes some people poor and others rich; he humbles some and makes others great. 
091Sm 2:8 He lifts the poor from the dust and raises the needy from their misery. He makes them companions of princes and puts them in places of honor. The foundations of the earth belong to the LORD; on them he has built the world. 
091Sm 2:9 "He protects the lives of his faithful people, but the wicked disappear in darkness; a man does not triumph by his own strength. 
091Sm 2:10 The LORD's enemies will be destroyed; he will thunder against them from heaven. The LORD will judge the whole world; he will give power to his king, he will make his chosen king victorious." 
091Sm 2:11 Then Elkanah went back home to Ramah, but the boy Samuel stayed in Shiloh and served the LORD under the priest Eli. 
091Sm 2:12 The sons of Eli were scoundrels. They paid no attention to the LORD 
091Sm 2:13 or to the regulations concerning what the priests could demand from the people. Instead, when someone was offering a sacrifice, the priest's servant would come with a three-pronged fork. While the meat was still cooking, 
091Sm 2:14 he would stick the fork into the cooking pot, and whatever the fork brought out belonged to the priest. All the Israelites who came to Shiloh to offer sacrifices were treated like this. 
091Sm 2:15 In addition, even before the fat was taken off and burned, the priest's servant would come and say to the one offering the sacrifice, "Give me some meat for the priest to roast; he won't accept boiled meat from you, only raw meat." 
091Sm 2:16 If the person answered, "Let us do what is right and burn the fat first; then take what you want," the priest's servant would say, "No! Give it to me now! If you don't, I will have to take it by force!" 
091Sm 2:17 This sin of the sons of Eli was extremely serious in the LORD's sight, because they treated the offerings to the LORD with such disrespect. 
091Sm 2:18 In the meantime the boy Samuel continued to serve the LORD, wearing a sacred linen apron. 
091Sm 2:19 Each year his mother would make a little robe and take it to him when she accompanied her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
091Sm 2:20 Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife, and say to Elkanah, "May the LORD give you other children by this woman to take the place of the one you dedicated to him." After that they would go back home. 
091Sm 2:21 The LORD did bless Hannah, and she had three more sons and two daughters. The boy Samuel grew up in the service of the LORD. 
091Sm 2:22 Eli was now very old. He kept hearing about everything his sons were doing to the Israelites and that they were even sleeping with the women who worked at the entrance to the Tent of the LORD's presence. 
091Sm 2:23 So he said to them, "Why are you doing these things? Everybody tells me about the evil you are doing. 
091Sm 2:24 Stop it, my sons! This is an awful thing the people of the LORD are talking about! 
091Sm 2:25 If anyone sins against someone else, God can defend the one who is wrong; but who can defend someone who sins against the LORD?" But they would not listen to their father, for the LORD had decided to kill them. 
091Sm 2:26 The boy Samuel continued to grow and to gain favor both with the LORD and with people. 
091Sm 2:27 A prophet came to Eli with this message from the LORD: "When your ancestor Aaron and his family were slaves of the king of Egypt, I revealed myself to Aaron. 
091Sm 2:28 From all the tribes of Israel I chose his family to be my priests, to serve at the altar, to burn the incense, and to wear the ephod to consult me. And I gave them the right to keep a share of the sacrifices burned on the altar. 
091Sm 2:29 Why, then, do you look with greed at the sacrifices and offerings which I require from my people? Why, Eli, do you honor your sons more than me by letting them fatten themselves on the best parts of all the sacrifices my people offer to me? 
091Sm 2:30 I, the LORD God of Israel, promised in the past that your family and your clan would serve me as priests for all time. But now I say that I won't have it any longer! Instead, I will honor those who honor me, and I will treat with contempt those who despise me. 
091Sm 2:31 Listen, the time is coming when I will kill all the young men in your family and your clan, so that no man in your family will live to be old. 
091Sm 2:32 You will be troubled and look with envy on all the blessings I will give to the other people of Israel, but no one in your family will ever again live to old age. 
091Sm 2:33 Yet I will keep one of your descendants alive, and he will serve me as priest. But he will become blind and lose all hope, and all your other descendants will die a violent death. 
091Sm 2:34 When your two sons Hophni and Phinehas both die on the same day, this will show you that everything I have said will come true. 
091Sm 2:35 I will choose a priest who will be faithful to me and do everything I want him to. I will give him descendants, who will always serve in the presence of my chosen king. 
091Sm 2:36 Any of your descendants who survive will have to go to that priest and ask him for money and food, and beg to be allowed to help the priests, in order to have something to eat." 
091Sm 3:1 In those days, when the boy Samuel was serving the LORD under the direction of Eli, there were very few messages from the LORD, and visions from him were quite rare. 
091Sm 3:2 One night Eli, who was now almost blind, was sleeping in his own room; 
091Sm 3:3 Samuel was sleeping in the sanctuary, where the sacred Covenant Box was. Before dawn, while the lamp was still burning, 
091Sm 3:4 the LORD called Samuel. He answered, "Yes, sir!" 
091Sm 3:5 and ran to Eli and said, "You called me, and here I am." But Eli answered, "I didn't call you; go back to bed." So Samuel went back to bed. 
091Sm 3:6 The LORD called Samuel again. The boy did not know that it was the LORD, because the LORD had never spoken to him before. 
091Sm 3:7 So he got up, went to Eli, and said, "You called me, and here I am." But Eli answered, "My son, I didn't call you; go back to bed." 
091Sm 3:8 The LORD called Samuel a third time; he got up, went to Eli, and said, "You called me, and here I am." Then Eli realized that it was the LORD who was calling the boy, 
091Sm 3:9 so he said to him, "Go back to bed; and if he calls you again, say, 'Speak, LORD, your servant is listening.' " So Samuel went back to bed. 
091Sm 3:10 The LORD came and stood there, and called as he had before, "Samuel! Samuel!" Samuel answered, "Speak; your servant is listening." 
091Sm 3:11 The LORD said to him, "Some day I am going to do something to the people of Israel that is so terrible that everyone who hears about it will be stunned. 
091Sm 3:12 On that day I will carry out all my threats against Eli's family, from beginning to end. 
091Sm 3:13 I have already told him that I am going to punish his family forever because his sons have spoken evil things against me. Eli knew they were doing this, but he did not stop them. 
091Sm 3:14 So I solemnly declare to the family of Eli that no sacrifice or offering will ever be able to remove the consequences of this terrible sin." 
091Sm 3:15 Samuel stayed in bed until morning; then he got up and opened the doors of the house of the LORD. He was afraid to tell Eli about the vision. 
091Sm 3:16 Eli called him, "Samuel, my boy!" "Yes, sir," answered Samuel. 
091Sm 3:17 "What did the LORD tell you?" Eli asked. "Don't keep anything from me. God will punish you severely if you don't tell me everything he said." 
091Sm 3:18 So Samuel told him everything; he did not keep anything back. Eli said, "He is the LORD; he will do whatever seems best to him." 
091Sm 3:19 As Samuel grew up, the LORD was with him and made come true everything that Samuel said. 
091Sm 3:20 So all the people of Israel, from one end of the country to the other, knew that Samuel was indeed a prophet of the LORD. 
091Sm 3:21 The LORD continued to reveal himself at Shiloh, where he had appeared to Samuel and had spoken to him. And when Samuel spoke, all Israel listened. 
091Sm 4:1 At that time the Philistines gathered to go to war against Israel, so the Israelites set out to fight them. The Israelites set up their camp at Ebenezer and the Philistines at Aphek. 
091Sm 4:2 The Philistines attacked, and after fierce fighting they defeated the Israelites and killed about four thousand men on the battlefield. 
091Sm 4:3 When the survivors came back to camp, the leaders of Israel said, "Why did the LORD let the Philistines defeat us today? Let's go and bring the LORD's Covenant Box from Shiloh, so that he will go with us and save us from our enemies." 
091Sm 4:4 So they sent messengers to Shiloh and got the Covenant Box of the LORD Almighty, who is enthroned above the winged creatures. And Eli's two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, came along with the Covenant Box. 
091Sm 4:5 When the Covenant Box arrived, the Israelites gave such a loud shout of joy that the earth shook. 
091Sm 4:6 The Philistines heard the shouting and said, "Listen to all that shouting in the Hebrew camp! What does it mean?" When they found out that the LORD's Covenant Box had arrived in the Hebrew camp, 
091Sm 4:7 they were afraid, and said, "A god has come into their camp! We're lost! Nothing like this has ever happened to us before! 
091Sm 4:8 Who can save us from those powerful gods? They are the gods who slaughtered the Egyptians in the desert! 
091Sm 4:9 Be brave, Philistines! Fight like men, or we will become slaves to the Hebrews, just as they were our slaves. So fight like men!" 
091Sm 4:10 The Philistines fought hard and defeated the Israelites, who went running to their homes. There was a great slaughter: thirty thousand Israelite soldiers were killed. 
091Sm 4:11 God's Covenant Box was captured, and Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were both killed. 
091Sm 4:12 A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran all the way from the battlefield to Shiloh and arrived there the same day. To show his grief, he had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head. 
091Sm 4:13 Eli, who was very worried about the Covenant Box, was sitting in his seat beside the road, staring. The man spread the news throughout the town, and everyone cried out in fear. 
091Sm 4:14 Eli heard the noise and asked, "What is all this noise about?" The man hurried to Eli to tell him the news. 
091Sm 4:15 (Eli was now ninety-eight years old and almost completely blind.) 
091Sm 4:16 The man said, "I have escaped from the battle and have run all the way here today." Eli asked him, "What happened, my son?" 
091Sm 4:17 The messenger answered, "Israel ran away from the Philistines; it was a terrible defeat for us! Besides that, your sons Hophni and Phinehas were killed, and God's Covenant Box was captured!" 
091Sm 4:18 When the man mentioned the Covenant Box, Eli fell backward from his seat beside the gate. He was so old and fat that the fall broke his neck, and he died. He had been a leader in Israel for forty years. 
091Sm 4:19 Eli's daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant, and it was almost time for her baby to be born. When she heard that God's Covenant Box had been captured and that her father-in-law and her husband were dead, she suddenly went into labor and gave birth. 
091Sm 4:20 As she was dying, the women helping her said to her, "Be brave! You have a son!" But she paid no attention and did not answer. 
091Sm 4:21 She named the boy Ichabod, explaining, "God's glory has left Israel" - referring to the capture of the Covenant Box and the death of her father-in-law and her husband. 
091Sm 4:22 "God's glory has left Israel," she said, "because God's Covenant Box has been captured." 
091Sm 5:1 After the Philistines captured the Covenant Box, they carried it from Ebenezer to their city of Ashdod, 
091Sm 5:2 took it into the temple of their god Dagon, and set it up beside his statue. 
091Sm 5:3 Early the next morning the people of Ashdod saw that the statue of Dagon had fallen face downward on the ground in front of the LORD's Covenant Box. So they lifted it up and put it back in its place. 
091Sm 5:4 Early the following morning they saw that the statue had again fallen down in front of the Covenant Box. This time its head and both its arms were broken off and were lying in the doorway; only the body was left. 
091Sm 5:5 (That is why even today the priests of Dagon and all his worshipers in Ashdod step over that place and do not walk on it.) 
091Sm 5:6 The LORD punished the people of Ashdod severely and terrified them. He punished them and the people in the surrounding territory by causing them to have tumors. 
091Sm 5:7 When they saw what was happening, they said, "The God of Israel is punishing us and our god Dagon. We can't let the Covenant Box stay here any longer." 
091Sm 5:8 So they sent messengers and called together all five of the Philistine kings and asked them, "What shall we do with the Covenant Box of the God of Israel?" "Take it over to Gath," they answered; so they took it to Gath, another Philistine city. 
091Sm 5:9 But after it arrived there, the LORD punished that city too and caused a great panic. He punished them with tumors which developed in all the people of the city, young and old alike. 
091Sm 5:10 So they sent the Covenant Box to Ekron, another Philistine city; but when it arrived there, the people cried out, "They have brought the Covenant Box of the God of Israel here, in order to kill us all!" 
091Sm 5:11 So again they sent for all the Philistine kings and said, "Send the Covenant Box of Israel back to its own place, so that it won't kill us and our families." There was panic throughout the city because God was punishing them so severely. 
091Sm 5:12 Even those who did not die developed tumors and the people cried out to their gods for help. 
091Sm 6:1 After the LORD's Covenant Box had been in Philistia for seven months, 
091Sm 6:2 the people called the priests and the magicians and asked, "What shall we do with the Covenant Box of the LORD? If we send it back where it belongs, what shall we send with it?" 
091Sm 6:3 They answered, "If you return the Covenant Box of the God of Israel, you must, of course, send with it a gift to him to pay for your sin. The Covenant Box must not go back without a gift. In this way you will be healed, and you will find out why he has kept on punishing you." 
091Sm 6:4 "What gift shall we send him?" the people asked. They answered, "Five gold models of tumors and five gold mice, one of each for each Philistine king. The same plague was sent on all of you and on the five kings. 
091Sm 6:5 You must make these models of the tumors and of the mice that are ravaging your country, and you must give honor to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will stop punishing you, your gods, and your land. 
091Sm 6:6 Why should you be stubborn, as the king of Egypt and the Egyptians were? Don't forget how God made fools of them until they let the Israelites leave Egypt. 
091Sm 6:7 So prepare a new wagon and two cows that have never been yoked; hitch them to the wagon and drive their calves back to the barn. 
091Sm 6:8 Take the LORD's Covenant Box, put it on the wagon, and place in a box beside it the gold models that you are sending to him as a gift to pay for your sins. Start the wagon on its way and let it go by itself. 
091Sm 6:9 Then watch it go; if it goes toward the town of Beth Shemesh, this means that it is the God of the Israelites who has sent this terrible disaster on us. But if it doesn't, then we will know that he did not send the plague; it was only a matter of chance." 
091Sm 6:10 They did what they were told: they took two cows and hitched them to the wagon, and shut the calves in the barn. 
091Sm 6:11 They put the Covenant Box in the wagon, together with the box containing the gold models of the mice and of the tumors. 
091Sm 6:12 The cows started off on the road to Beth Shemesh and headed straight toward it, without turning off the road. They were mooing as they went. The five Philistine kings followed them as far as the border of Beth Shemesh. 
091Sm 6:13 The people of Beth Shemesh were reaping wheat in the valley, when suddenly they looked up and saw the Covenant Box. They were overjoyed at the sight. 
091Sm 6:14 The wagon came to a field belonging to a man named Joshua, who lived in Beth Shemesh, and it stopped there near a large rock. The people chopped up the wooden wagon and killed the cows and burned them as a burnt sacrifice to the LORD. 
091Sm 6:15 The Levites lifted off the Covenant Box of the LORD and the box with the gold models in it, and placed them on the large rock. Then the people of Beth Shemesh offered burnt sacrifices and other sacrifices to the LORD. 
091Sm 6:16 The five Philistine kings watched them do this and then went back to Ekron that same day. 
091Sm 6:17 The Philistines sent the five gold tumors to the LORD as a gift to pay for their sins, one each for the cities of Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. 
091Sm 6:18 They also sent gold mice, one for each of the cities ruled by the five Philistine kings, both the fortified towns and the villages without walls. The large rock in the field of Joshua of Beth Shemesh, on which they placed the LORD's Covenant Box, is still there as a witness to what happened. 
091Sm 6:19 The LORD killed seventy of the men of Beth Shemesh because they looked inside the Covenant Box. And the people mourned because the LORD had caused such a great slaughter among them. 
091Sm 6:20 So the men of Beth Shemesh said, "Who can stand before the LORD, this holy God? Where can we send him to get him away from us?" 
091Sm 6:21 They sent messengers to the people of Kiriath Jearim to say, "The Philistines have returned the LORD's Covenant Box. Come down and get it." 
091Sm 7:1 So the people of Kiriath Jearim got the LORD's Covenant Box and took it to the house of a man named Abinadab, who lived on a hill. They consecrated his son Eleazar to be in charge of it. 
091Sm 7:2 The Covenant Box of the LORD stayed in Kiriath Jearim a long time, some twenty years. During this time all the Israelites cried to the LORD for help. 
091Sm 7:3 Samuel said to the people of Israel, "If you are going to turn to the LORD with all your hearts, you must get rid of all the foreign gods and the images of the goddess Astarte. Dedicate yourselves completely to the LORD and worship only him, and he will rescue you from the power of the Philistines." 
091Sm 7:4 So the Israelites got rid of their idols of Baal and Astarte, and worshiped only the LORD. 
091Sm 7:5 Then Samuel called for all the Israelites to meet at Mizpah, telling them, "I will pray to the LORD for you there." 
091Sm 7:6 So they all gathered at Mizpah. They drew some water and poured it out as an offering to the LORD and fasted that whole day. They said, "We have sinned against the LORD." (It was at Mizpah where Samuel settled disputes among the Israelites.) 
091Sm 7:7 When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the five Philistine kings started out with their men to attack them. The Israelites heard about it and were afraid, 
091Sm 7:8 and said to Samuel, "Keep praying to the LORD our God to save us from the Philistines." 
091Sm 7:9 Samuel killed a young lamb and burned it whole as a sacrifice to the LORD. Then he prayed to the LORD to help Israel, and the LORD answered his prayer. 
091Sm 7:10 While Samuel was offering the sacrifice, the Philistines moved forward to attack; but just then the LORD thundered from heaven against them. They became completely confused and fled in panic. 
091Sm 7:11 The Israelites marched out from Mizpah and pursued the Philistines almost as far as Bethcar, killing them along the way. 
091Sm 7:12 Then Samuel took a stone, set it up between Mizpah and Shen, and said, "The LORD has helped us all the way" - and he named it "Stone of Help." 
091Sm 7:13 So the Philistines were defeated, and the LORD prevented them from invading Israel's territory as long as Samuel lived. 
091Sm 7:14 All the cities which the Philistines had captured between Ekron and Gath were returned to Israel, and so Israel got back all its territory. And there was peace also between the Israelites and the Canaanites. 
091Sm 7:15 Samuel ruled Israel as long as he lived. 
091Sm 7:16 Every year he would go around to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and in these places he would settle disputes. 
091Sm 7:17 Then he would go back to his home in Ramah, where also he would serve as judge. In Ramah he built an altar to the LORD. 
091Sm 8:1 When Samuel grew old, he made his sons judges in Israel. 
091Sm 8:2 The older son was named Joel and the younger one Abijah; they were judges in Beersheba. 
091Sm 8:3 But they did not follow their father's example; they were interested only in making money, so they accepted bribes and did not decide cases honestly. 
091Sm 8:4 Then all the leaders of Israel met together, went to Samuel in Ramah, 
091Sm 8:5 and said to him, "Look, you are getting old and your sons don't follow your example. So then, appoint a king to rule over us, so that we will have a king, as other countries have." 
091Sm 8:6 Samuel was displeased with their request for a king; so he prayed to the LORD, 
091Sm 8:7 and the LORD said, "Listen to everything the people say to you. You are not the one they have rejected; I am the one they have rejected as their king. 
091Sm 8:8 Ever since I brought them out of Egypt, they have turned away from me and worshiped other gods; and now they are doing to you what they have always done to me. 
091Sm 8:9 So then, listen to them, but give them strict warnings and explain how their kings will treat them." 
091Sm 8:10 Samuel told the people who were asking him for a king everything that the LORD had said to him. 
091Sm 8:11 "This is how your king will treat you," Samuel explained. "He will make soldiers of your sons; some of them will serve in his war chariots, others in his cavalry, and others will run before his chariots. 
091Sm 8:12 He will make some of them officers in charge of a thousand men, and others in charge of fifty men. Your sons will have to plow his fields, harvest his crops, and make his weapons and the equipment for his chariots. 
091Sm 8:13 Your daughters will have to make perfumes for him and work as his cooks and his bakers. 
091Sm 8:14 He will take your best fields, vineyards, and olive groves, and give them to his officials. 
091Sm 8:15 He will take a tenth of your grain and of your grapes for his court officers and other officials. 
091Sm 8:16 He will take your servants and your best cattle and donkeys, and make them work for him. 
091Sm 8:17 He will take a tenth of your flocks. And you yourselves will become his slaves. 
091Sm 8:18 When that time comes, you will complain bitterly because of your king, whom you yourselves chose, but the LORD will not listen to your complaints." 
091Sm 8:19 The people paid no attention to Samuel, but said, "No! We want a king, 
091Sm 8:20 so that we will be like other nations, with our own king to rule us and to lead us out to war and to fight our battles." 
091Sm 8:21 Samuel listened to everything they said and then went and told it to the LORD. 
091Sm 8:22 The LORD answered, "Do what they want and give them a king." Then Samuel told all the men of Israel to go back home. 
091Sm 9:1 There was a wealthy and influential man named Kish, from the tribe of Benjamin; he was the son of Abiel and grandson of Zeror, and belonged to the family of Becorath, a part of the clan of Aphiah. 
091Sm 9:2 He had a son named Saul, a handsome man in the prime of life. Saul was a foot taller than anyone else in Israel and more handsome as well. 
091Sm 9:3 Some donkeys belonging to Kish had wandered off, so he said to Saul, "Take one of the servants with you and go and look for the donkeys." 
091Sm 9:4 They went through the hill country of Ephraim and the region of Shalishah, but did not find them; so they went on through the region of Shaalim, but the donkeys were not there. Then they went through the territory of Benjamin, but still did not find them. 
091Sm 9:5 When they came into the region of Zuph, Saul said to his servant, "Let's go back home, or my father might stop thinking about the donkeys and start worrying about us." 
091Sm 9:6 The servant answered, "Wait! In this town there is a holy man who is highly respected because everything he says comes true. Let's go to him, and maybe he can tell us where we can find the donkeys." 
091Sm 9:7 "If we go to him, what can we give him?" Saul asked. "There is no food left in our packs, and we don't have a thing to give him, do we?" 
091Sm 9:8 The servant answered, "I have a small silver coin. I can give him that, and then he will tell us where we can find them." 
091Sm 9:9 Saul replied, "A good idea! Let's go." So they went to the town where the holy man lived. 
091Sm 9:10 As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women who were coming out to draw water. They asked these women, "Is the seer in town?" 
091Sm 9:11 (At that time a prophet was called a seer, and so whenever someone wanted to ask God a question, he would say, "Let's go to the seer.") 
091Sm 9:12 "Yes, he is," the young women answered. "In fact, he is just ahead of you. If you hurry, you will catch up with him. As soon as you go into town, you will find him. He arrived in town today because the people are going to offer a sacrifice on the altar on the hill. 
091Sm 9:13 The people who are invited won't start eating until he gets there, because he has to bless the sacrifice first. If you go now, you will find him before he goes up the hill to eat." 
091Sm 9:14 So Saul and his servant went on to the town, and as they were going in, they saw Samuel coming out toward them on his way to the place of worship. 
091Sm 9:15 Now on the previous day the LORD had told Samuel, 
091Sm 9:16 "Tomorrow about this time I will send you a man from the tribe of Benjamin; anoint him as ruler of my people Israel, and he will rescue them from the Philistines. I have seen the suffering of my people and have heard their cries for help." 
091Sm 9:17 When Samuel caught sight of Saul, the LORD said to him, "This is the man I told you about. He will rule my people." 
091Sm 9:18 Then Saul went over to Samuel, who was near the gate, and asked, "Tell me, where does the seer live?" 
091Sm 9:19 Samuel answered, "I am the seer. Go on ahead of me to the place of worship. Both of you are to eat with me today. Tomorrow morning I will answer all your questions and send you on your way. 
091Sm 9:20 As for the donkeys that were lost three days ago, don't worry about them; they have already been found. But who is it that the people of Israel want so much? It is you - you and your father's family." 
091Sm 9:21 Saul answered, "I belong to the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe in Israel, and my family is the least important one in the tribe. Why, then, do you talk like this to me?" 
091Sm 9:22 Then Samuel led Saul and his servant into the large room and gave them a place at the head of the table where the guests, about thirty in all, were seated. 
091Sm 9:23 Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the piece of meat I gave you, which I told you to set aside." 
091Sm 9:24 So the cook brought the choice piece of the leg and placed it before Saul. Samuel said, "Look, here is the piece that was kept for you. Eat it. I saved it for you to eat at this time with the people I invited." So Saul ate with Samuel that day. 
091Sm 9:25 When they went down from the place of worship to the town, they fixed up a bed for Saul on the roof, 
091Sm 9:26 and he slept there. At dawn Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get up, and I will send you on your way." Saul got up, and he and Samuel went out to the street together. 
091Sm 9:27 When they arrived at the edge of town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell the servant to go on ahead of us." The servant left, and Samuel continued, "Stay here a minute, and I will tell you what God has said." 
091Sm 10:1 Then Samuel took a jar of olive oil and poured it on Saul's head, kissed him, and said, "The LORD anoints you as ruler of his people Israel. You will rule his people and protect them from all their enemies. And this is the proof to you that the LORD has chosen you to be the ruler of his people�� 091Sm 10:2 When you leave me today, you will meet two men near Rachel's tomb at Zelzah in the territory of Benjamin. They will tell you that the donkeys you were looking for have been found, so that your father isn't worried any more about them but about you, and he keeps asking, 'What shall I do about my son?' 
091Sm 10:3 You will go on from there until you come to the sacred tree at Tabor, where you will meet three men on their way to offer a sacrifice to God at Bethel. One of them will be leading three young goats, another one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and the third one will have a leather bag full of wine. 
091Sm 10:4 They will greet you and offer you two of the loaves, which you are to accept. 
091Sm 10:5 Then you will go to the Hill of God in Gibeah, where there is a Philistine camp. At the entrance to the town you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the altar on the hill, playing harps, drums, flutes, and lyres. They will be dancing and shouting. 
091Sm 10:6 Suddenly the spirit of the LORD will take control of you, and you will join in their religious dancing and shouting and will become a different person. 
091Sm 10:7 When these things happen, do whatever God leads you to do. 
091Sm 10:8 You will go ahead of me to Gilgal, where I will meet you and offer burnt sacrifices and fellowship sacrifices. Wait there seven days until I come and tell you what to do." 
091Sm 10:9 When Saul turned to leave Samuel, God gave Saul a new nature. And everything Samuel had told him happened that day. 
091Sm 10:10 When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, a group of prophets met him. Suddenly the spirit of God took control of him, and he joined in their ecstatic dancing and shouting. 
091Sm 10:11 People who had known him before saw him doing this and asked one another, "What has happened to the son of Kish? Has Saul become a prophet?" 
091Sm 10:12 A man who lived there asked, "How about these other prophets - who do you think their fathers are?" This is how the saying originated, "Has even Saul become a prophet?" 
091Sm 10:13 When Saul finished his ecstatic dancing and shouting, he went to the altar on the hill. 
091Sm 10:14 Saul's uncle saw him and the servant, and he asked them, "Where have you been?" "Looking for the donkeys," Saul answered. "When we couldn't find them, we went to see Samuel." 
091Sm 10:15 "And what did he tell you?" Saul's uncle asked. 
091Sm 10:16 "He told us that the animals had been found," Saul answered - but he did not tell his uncle what Samuel had said about his becoming king. 
091Sm 10:17 Samuel called the people together for a religious gathering at Mizpah 
091Sm 10:18 and said to them, "The LORD, the God of Israel, says, 'I brought you out of Egypt and rescued you from the Egyptians and all the other peoples who were oppressing you. 
091Sm 10:19 I am your God, the one who rescues you from all your troubles and difficulties, but today you have rejected me and have asked me to give you a king. Very well, then, gather yourselves before the LORD by tribes and by clans.' " 
091Sm 10:20 Then Samuel had each tribe come forward, and the LORD picked the tribe of Benjamin. 
091Sm 10:21 Then Samuel had the families of the tribe of Benjamin come forward, and the family of Matri was picked out. Then the men of the family of Matri came forward, and Saul son of Kish was picked out. They looked for him, but when they could not find him, 
091Sm 10:22 they asked the LORD, "Is there still someone else?" The LORD answered, "Saul is over there, hiding behind the supplies." 
091Sm 10:23 So they ran and brought Saul out to the people, and they could see that he was a foot taller than anyone else. 
091Sm 10:24 Samuel said to the people, "Here is the man the LORD has chosen! There is no one else among us like him." All the people shouted, "Long live the king!" 
091Sm 10:25 Samuel explained to the people the rights and duties of a king, and then wrote them in a book, which he deposited in a holy place. Then he sent everyone home. 
091Sm 10:26 Saul also went back home to Gibeah. Some powerful men, whose hearts God had touched, went with him. 
091Sm 10:27 But some worthless people said, "How can this fellow do us any good?" They despised Saul and did not bring him any gifts. 
091Sm 11:1 About a month later King Nahash of Ammon led his army against the town of Jabesh in the territory of Gilead and besieged it. The men of Jabesh said to Nahash, "Make a treaty with us, and we will accept you as our ruler." 
091Sm 11:2 Nahash answered, "I will make a treaty with you on one condition: I will put out everyone's right eye and so bring disgrace on all Israel." 
091Sm 11:3 The leaders of Jabesh said, "Give us seven days to send messengers throughout the land of Israel. If no one will help us, then we will surrender to you." 
091Sm 11:4 The messengers arrived at Gibeah, where Saul lived, and when they told the news, the people started crying in despair. 
091Sm 11:5 Saul was just then coming in from the field with his oxen, and he asked, "What's wrong? Why is everyone crying?" They told him what the messengers from Jabesh had reported. 
091Sm 11:6 When Saul heard this, the spirit of God took control of him, and he became furious. 
091Sm 11:7 He took two oxen, cut them in pieces, and had messengers carry the pieces throughout the land of Israel with this warning: "Whoever does not follow Saul and Samuel into battle will have this done to his oxen!" The people of Israel were afraid of what the LORD might do, and all of them, without exception, came out together. 
091Sm 11:8 Saul gathered them at Bezek: there were 300,000 from Israel and 30,000 from Judah. 
091Sm 11:9 They said to the messengers from Jabesh, "Tell your people that before noon tomorrow they will be rescued." When the people of Jabesh received the message, they were overjoyed 
091Sm 11:10 and said to Nahash, "Tomorrow we will surrender to you, and you can do with us whatever you wish." 
091Sm 11:11 That night Saul divided his men into three groups, and at dawn the next day they rushed into the enemy camp and attacked the Ammonites. By noon they had slaughtered them. The survivors scattered, each man running off by himself. 
091Sm 11:12 Then the people of Israel said to Samuel, "Where are the people who said that Saul should not be our king? Hand them over to us, and we will kill them!" 
091Sm 11:13 But Saul said, "No one will be put to death today, for this is the day the LORD rescued Israel." 
091Sm 11:14 And Samuel said to them, "Let us all go to Gilgal and once more proclaim Saul as our king." 
091Sm 11:15 So they all went to Gilgal, and there at the holy place they proclaimed Saul king. They offered fellowship sacrifices, and Saul and all the people of Israel celebrated the event. 
091Sm 12:1 Then Samuel said to the people of Israel, "I have done what you asked me to do. I have given you a king to rule you, 
091Sm 12:2 and now you have him to lead you. As for me, I am old and gray, and my sons are with you. I have been your leader from my youth until now. 
091Sm 12:3 Here I am. If I have done anything wrong, accuse me now in the presence of the LORD and the king he has chosen. Have I taken anybody's cow or anybody's donkey? Have I cheated or oppressed anyone? Have I accepted a bribe from anyone? If I have done any of these things, I will pay back what I have taken." 
091Sm 12:4 The people answered, "No, you have not cheated us or oppressed us; you have not taken anything from anyone." 
091Sm 12:5 Samuel replied, "The LORD and the king he has chosen are witnesses today that you have found me to be completely innocent." "Yes, the LORD is our witness," they answered. 
091Sm 12:6 Samuel continued, "The LORD is the one who chose Moses and Aaron and who brought your ancestors out of Egypt. 
091Sm 12:7 Now stand where you are, and I will accuse you before the LORD by reminding you of all the mighty actions the LORD did to save you and your ancestors. 
091Sm 12:8 When Jacob and his family went to Egypt and the Egyptians oppressed them, your ancestors cried to the LORD for help, and he sent Moses and Aaron, who brought them out of Egypt and settled them in this land. 
091Sm 12:9 But the people forgot the LORD their God, and so he let the Philistines and the king of Moab and Sisera, commander of the army of the city of Hazor, fight against your ancestors and conquer them. 
091Sm 12:10 Then they cried to the LORD for help and said, 'We have sinned, because we turned away from you, LORD, and worshiped the idols of Baal and Astarte. Rescue us from our enemies, and we will worship you!' 
091Sm 12:11 And the LORD sent Gideon, Barak, Jephthah, and finally me. Each of us rescued you from your enemies, and you lived in safety. 
091Sm 12:12 But when you saw that King Nahash of Ammon was about to attack you, you rejected the LORD as your king and said to me, 'We want a king to rule us.' 
091Sm 12:13 "Now here is the king you chose; you asked for him, and now the LORD has given him to you. 
091Sm 12:14 All will go well with you if you honor the LORD your God, serve him, listen to him, and obey his commands, and if you and your king follow him. 
091Sm 12:15 But if you do not listen to the LORD but disobey his commands, he will be against you and your king. 
091Sm 12:16 So then, stand where you are, and you will see the great thing which the LORD is going to do. 
091Sm 12:17 It's the dry season, isn't it? But I will pray, and the LORD will send thunder and rain. When this happens, you will realize that you committed a great sin against the LORD when you asked him for a king." 
091Sm 12:18 So Samuel prayed, and on that same day the LORD sent thunder and rain. Then all the people became afraid of the LORD and of Samuel, 
091Sm 12:19 and they said to Samuel, "Please, sir, pray to the LORD your God for us, so that we won't die. We now realize that, besides all our other sins, we have sinned by asking for a king." 
091Sm 12:20 "Don't be afraid," Samuel answered. "Even though you have done such an evil thing, do not turn away from the LORD, but serve him with all your heart. 
091Sm 12:21 Don't go after false gods; they cannot help you or save you, for they are not real. 
091Sm 12:22 The LORD has made a solemn promise, and he will not abandon you, for he has decided to make you his own people. 
091Sm 12:23 As for me, the LORD forbid that I should sin against him by no longer praying for you. Instead, I will teach you what is good and right for you to do. 
091Sm 12:24 Obey the LORD and serve him faithfully with all your heart. Remember the great things he has done for you. 
091Sm 12:25 But if you continue to sin, you and your king will be destroyed." 
091Sm 13:1 OMITTED TEXT
091Sm 13:2 Saul picked three thousand men, keeping two thousand of them with him in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel and sending one thousand with his son Jonathan to Gibeah, in the territory of the tribe of Benjamin. The rest of the men Saul sent home. 
091Sm 13:3 Jonathan killed the Philistine commander in Geba, and all the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul sent messengers to call the Hebrews to war by blowing a trumpet throughout the whole country. 
091Sm 13:4 All the Israelites were told that Saul had killed the Philistine commander and that the Philistines hated them. So the people answered the call to join Saul at Gilgal. 
091Sm 13:5 The Philistines assembled to fight the Israelites; they had thirty thousand war chariots, six thousand cavalry troops, and as many soldiers as there are grains of sand on the seashore. They went to Michmash, east of Bethaven, and camped there. 
091Sm 13:6 Then they launched a strong attack against the Israelites, putting them in a desperate situation. Some of the Israelites hid in caves and holes or among the rocks or in pits and wells; 
091Sm 13:7 others crossed the Jordan River into the territories of Gad and Gilead. Saul was still at Gilgal, and the people with him were trembling with fear. 
091Sm 13:8 He waited seven days for Samuel, as Samuel had instructed him to do, but Samuel still had not come to Gilgal. The people began to desert Saul, 
091Sm 13:9 so he said to them, "Bring me the burnt sacrifices and the fellowship sacrifices." He offered a burnt sacrifice, 
091Sm 13:10 and just as he was finishing, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to meet him and welcome him, 
091Sm 13:11 but Samuel said, "What have you done?" Saul answered, "The people were deserting me, and you had not come when you said you would; besides that, the Philistines are gathering at Michmash. 
091Sm 13:12 So I thought, 'The Philistines are going to attack me here in Gilgal, and I have not tried to win the LORD's favor.' So I felt I had to offer a sacrifice." 
091Sm 13:13 "That was a foolish thing to do," Samuel answered. "You have not obeyed the command the LORD your God gave you. If you had obeyed, he would have let you and your descendants rule over Israel forever. 
091Sm 13:14 But now your rule will not continue. Because you have disobeyed him, the LORD will find the kind of man he wants and make him ruler of his people." 
091Sm 13:15 Samuel left Gilgal and went on his way. The rest of the people followed Saul as he went to join his soldiers. They went from Gilgal to Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin. Saul inspected his troops, about six hundred men. 
091Sm 13:16 Saul, his son Jonathan, and their men camped in Geba in the territory of Benjamin; the Philistine camp was at Michmash. 
091Sm 13:17 The Philistine soldiers went out on raids from their camp in three groups: one group went toward Ophrah in the territory of Shual, 
091Sm 13:18 another went toward Beth Horon, and the other one went to the border overlooking Zeboim Valley and the wilderness. 
091Sm 13:19 There were no blacksmiths in Israel because the Philistines were determined to keep the Hebrews from making swords and spears. 
091Sm 13:20 (The Israelites had to go to the Philistines to get their plows, hoes, axes, and sickles sharpened; 
091Sm 13:21 the charge was one small coin for sharpening axes and for fixing goads, and two coins for sharpening plows or hoes.) 
091Sm 13:22 And so on the day of battle none of the Israelite soldiers except Saul and his son Jonathan had swords or spears. 
091Sm 13:23 The Philistines sent a group of soldiers to defend Michmash Pass. 
091Sm 14:1 One day Jonathan said to the young man who carried his weapons, "Let's go across to the Philistine camp." But Jonathan did not tell his father Saul, 
091Sm 14:2 who was camping under a pomegranate tree in Migron, not far from Gibeah; he had about six hundred men with him. 
091Sm 14:3 (The priest carrying the ephod was Ahijah, the son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub, who was the son of Phinehas and grandson of Eli, the priest of the LORD in Shiloh.) The men did not know that Jonathan had left. 
091Sm 14:4 In Michmash Pass, which Jonathan had to go through to get over to the Philistine camp, there were two large jagged rocks, one on each side of the pass: one was called Bozez and the other Seneh. 
091Sm 14:5 One was on the north side of the pass, facing Michmash, and the other was on the south side, facing Geba. 
091Sm 14:6 Jonathan said to the young man, "Let's cross over to the camp of those heathen Philistines. Maybe the LORD will help us; if he does, nothing can keep him from giving us the victory, no matter how few of us there are." 
091Sm 14:7 The young man answered, "Whatever you want to do, I'm with you." 
091Sm 14:8 "All right," Jonathan said. "We will go across and let the Philistines see us. 
091Sm 14:9 If they tell us to wait for them to come to us, then we will stay where we are. 
091Sm 14:10 But if they tell us to go to them, then we will, because that will be the sign that the LORD has given us victory over them." 
091Sm 14:11 So they let the Philistines see them, and the Philistines said, "Look! Some Hebrews are coming out of the holes they have been hiding in!" 
091Sm 14:12 Then they called out to Jonathan and the young man, "Come on up here! We have something to tell you!" Jonathan said to the young man, "Follow me. The LORD has given Israel victory over them." 
091Sm 14:13 Jonathan climbed up out of the pass on his hands and knees, and the young man followed him. Jonathan attacked the Philistines and knocked them down, and the young man killed them. 
091Sm 14:14 In that first slaughter Jonathan and the young man killed about twenty men in an area of about half an acre. 
091Sm 14:15 All the Philistines in the countryside were terrified; the raiders and the soldiers in the camp trembled with fear; the earth shook, and there was great panic. 
091Sm 14:16 Saul's men on watch at Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin saw the Philistines running in confusion. 
091Sm 14:17 So Saul said to his men, "Count the soldiers and find out who is missing." They did so and found that Jonathan and the young man who carried his weapons were missing. 
091Sm 14:18 "Bring the ephod here," Saul said to Ahijah the priest. (On that day Ahijah was carrying it in front of the people of Israel.) 
091Sm 14:19 As Saul was speaking to the priest, the confusion in the Philistine camp kept getting worse, so Saul said to him, "There's no time to consult the LORD!" 
091Sm 14:20 Then he and his men marched into battle against the Philistines, who were fighting each other in complete confusion. 
091Sm 14:21 Some Hebrews, who had been on the Philistine side and had gone with them to the camp, changed sides again and joined Saul and Jonathan. 
091Sm 14:22 Others, who had been hiding in the hills of Ephraim, heard that the Philistines were running away, so they also joined in and attacked the Philistines, 
091Sm 14:23 fighting all the way beyond Bethaven. The LORD saved Israel that day. 
091Sm 14:24 The Israelites were weak with hunger that day, because Saul, with a solemn oath, had given the order: "A curse be on anyone who eats any food today before I take revenge on my enemies." So nobody had eaten anything all day. 
091Sm 14:25 They all came into a wooded area and found honey everywhere. 
091Sm 14:26 The woods were full of honey, but no one ate any of it because they were all afraid of Saul's curse. 
091Sm 14:27 But Jonathan had not heard his father threaten the people with a curse; so he reached out with the stick he was carrying, dipped it in a honeycomb, and ate some honey. At once he felt much better. 
091Sm 14:28 But one of the men told him, "We are all weak from hunger, but your father threatened us and said, 'A curse be on anyone who eats any food today.' " 
091Sm 14:29 Jonathan answered, "What a terrible thing my father has done to our people! See how much better I feel because I ate some honey! 
091Sm 14:30 How much better it would have been today if our people had eaten the food they took when they defeated the enemy. Just think how many more Philistines they would have killed!" 
091Sm 14:31 That day the Israelites defeated the Philistines, fighting all the way from Michmash to Aijalon. By this time the Israelites were very weak from hunger, 
091Sm 14:32 and so they rushed over to what they had captured from the enemy, took sheep and cattle, slaughtered them on the spot, and ate the meat with the blood still in it. 
091Sm 14:33 Saul was told, "Look, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating meat with the blood in it." "You are traitors!" Saul cried out. "Roll a big stone over here to me." 
091Sm 14:34 Then he gave another order: "Go among the people and tell them all to bring their cattle and sheep here. They are to slaughter them and eat them here; they must not sin against the LORD by eating meat with blood in it." So that night they all brought their cattle and slaughtered them there. 
091Sm 14:35 Saul built an altar to the LORD, the first one that he built. 
091Sm 14:36 Saul said to his men, "Let's go down and attack the Philistines in the night, plunder them until dawn, and kill them all." "Do whatever you think best," they answered. But the priest said, "Let's consult God first." 
091Sm 14:37 So Saul asked God, "Shall I attack the Philistines? Will you give us victory?" But God did not answer that day. 
091Sm 14:38 Then Saul said to the leaders of the people, "Come here and find out what sin was committed today. 
091Sm 14:39 I promise by the living LORD, who gives Israel victory, that the guilty one will be put to death, even if he is my son Jonathan." But no one said anything. 
091Sm 14:40 Then Saul said to them, "All of you stand over there, and Jonathan and I will stand over here." "Do whatever you think best," they answered. 
091Sm 14:41 Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, " LORD, why have you not answered me today? LORD, God of Israel, answer me by the sacred stones. If the guilt is Jonathan's or mine, answer by the Urim; but if it belongs to your people Israel, answer by the Thummim." The answer indicated Jonathan and Saul; and the people were cleared. 
091Sm 14:42 Then Saul said, "Decide between my son Jonathan and me." And Jonathan was indicated. 
091Sm 14:43 Then Saul asked Jonathan, "What have you done?" Jonathan answered, "I ate a little honey with the stick I was holding. Here I am - I am ready to die." 
091Sm 14:44 Saul said to him, "May God strike me dead if you are not put to death!" 
091Sm 14:45 But the people said to Saul, "Will Jonathan, who won this great victory for Israel, be put to death? No! We promise by the living LORD that he will not lose even a hair from his head. What he did today was done with God's help." So the people saved Jonathan from being put to death. 
091Sm 14:46 After that, Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and they went back to their own territory. 
091Sm 14:47 After Saul became king of Israel, he fought all his enemies everywhere: the people of Moab, of Ammon, and of Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he fought he was victorious. 
091Sm 14:48 He fought heroically and defeated even the people of Amalek. He saved the Israelites from all attacks. 
091Sm 14:49 Saul's sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchishua. His older daughter was named Merab, and the younger one Michal. 
091Sm 14:50 His wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz; his army commander was his cousin Abner, the son of his uncle Ner. 
091Sm 14:51 Saul's father Kish and Abner's father Ner were sons of Abiel. 
091Sm 14:52 As long as he lived, Saul had to fight fiercely against the Philistines. So whenever he found a man who was strong or brave, he would enlist him in his army. 
091Sm 15:1 Samuel said to Saul, "I am the one whom the LORD sent to anoint you king of his people Israel. Now listen to what the LORD Almighty says. 
091Sm 15:2 He is going to punish the people of Amalek because their ancestors opposed the Israelites when they were coming from Egypt. 
091Sm 15:3 Go and attack the Amalekites and completely destroy everything they have. Don't leave a thing; kill all the men, women, children, and babies; the cattle, sheep, camels, and donkeys." 
091Sm 15:4 Saul called his forces together and inspected them at Telem: there were 200,000 soldiers from Israel and 10,000 from Judah. 
091Sm 15:5 Then he and his men went to the city of Amalek and waited in ambush in a dry riverbed. 
091Sm 15:6 He sent a warning to the Kenites, a people whose ancestors had been kind to the Israelites when they came from Egypt: "Go away and leave the Amalekites, so that I won't kill you along with them." So the Kenites left. 
091Sm 15:7 Saul defeated the Amalekites, fighting all the way from Havilah to Shur, east of Egypt; 
091Sm 15:8 he captured King Agag of Amalek alive and killed all the people. 
091Sm 15:9 But Saul and his men spared Agag's life and did not kill the best sheep and cattle, the best calves and lambs, or anything else that was good; they destroyed only what was useless or worthless. 
091Sm 15:10 The LORD said to Samuel, 
091Sm 15:11 "I am sorry that I made Saul king; he has turned away from me and disobeyed my commands." Samuel was angry, and all night long he pleaded with the LORD. 
091Sm 15:12 Early the following morning he went off to find Saul. He heard that Saul had gone to the town of Carmel, where he had built a monument to himself, and then had gone on to Gilgal. 
091Sm 15:13 Samuel went up to Saul, who greeted him, saying, "The LORD bless you, Samuel! I have obeyed the LORD's command." 
091Sm 15:14 Samuel asked, "Why, then, do I hear cattle mooing and sheep bleating?" 
091Sm 15:15 Saul answered, "My men took them from the Amalekites. They kept the best sheep and cattle to offer as a sacrifice to the LORD your God, and the rest we have destroyed completely." 
091Sm 15:16 "Stop," Samuel ordered, "and I will tell you what the LORD said to me last night." "Tell me," Saul said. 
091Sm 15:17 Samuel answered, "Even though you consider yourself of no importance, you are the leader of the tribes of Israel. The LORD anointed you king of Israel, 
091Sm 15:18 and he sent you out with orders to destroy those wicked people of Amalek. He told you to fight until you had killed them all. 
091Sm 15:19 Why, then, did you not obey him? Why did you rush to grab the loot, and so do what displeases the LORD?" 
091Sm 15:20 "I did obey the LORD," Saul replied. "I went out as he told me to, brought back King Agag, and killed all the Amalekites. 
091Sm 15:21 But my men did not kill the best sheep and cattle that they captured; instead, they brought them here to Gilgal to offer as a sacrifice to the LORD your God." 
091Sm 15:22 Samuel said, "Which does the LORD prefer: obedience or offerings and sacrifices? It is better to obey him than to sacrifice the best sheep to him. 
091Sm 15:23 Rebellion against him is as bad as witchcraft, and arrogance is as sinful as idolatry. Because you rejected the LORD's command, he has rejected you as king." 
091Sm 15:24 "Yes, I have sinned," Saul replied. "I disobeyed the LORD's command and your instructions. I was afraid of my men and did what they wanted. 
091Sm 15:25 But now I beg you, forgive my sin and go back with me, so that I can worship the LORD." 
091Sm 15:26 "I will not go back with you," Samuel answered. "You rejected the LORD's command, and he has rejected you as king of Israel." 
091Sm 15:27 Then Samuel turned to leave, but Saul caught hold of his cloak, and it tore. 
091Sm 15:28 Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today and given it to someone who is a better man than you. 
091Sm 15:29 Israel's majestic God does not lie or change his mind. He is not a human being - he does not change his mind." 
091Sm 15:30 "I have sinned," Saul replied. "But at least show me respect in front of the leaders of my people and all of Israel. Go back with me so that I can worship the LORD your God." 
091Sm 15:31 So Samuel went back with him, and Saul worshiped the LORD. 
091Sm 15:32 "Bring King Agag here to me," Samuel ordered. Agag came to him, trembling with fear, thinking to himself, "What a bitter thing it is to die!" 
091Sm 15:33 Samuel said, "As your sword has made many mothers childless, so now your mother will become childless." And he cut Agag to pieces in front of the altar in Gilgal. 
091Sm 15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah, and King Saul went home to Gibeah. 
091Sm 15:35 As long as Samuel lived, he never again saw the king; but he grieved over him. The LORD was sorry that he had made Saul king of Israel. 
091Sm 16:1 The LORD said to Samuel, "How long will you go on grieving over Saul? I have rejected him as king of Israel. But now get some olive oil and go to Bethlehem, to a man named Jesse, because I have chosen one of his sons to be king." 
091Sm 16:2 "How can I do that?" Samuel asked. "If Saul hears about it, he will kill me!" The LORD answered, "Take a calf with you and say that you are there to offer a sacrifice to the LORD. 
091Sm 16:3 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will tell you what to do. You will anoint as king the man I tell you to." 
091Sm 16:4 Samuel did what the LORD told him to do and went to Bethlehem, where the city leaders came trembling to meet him and asked, "Is this a peaceful visit, seer?" 
091Sm 16:5 "Yes," he answered. "I have come to offer a sacrifice to the LORD. Purify yourselves and come with me." He also told Jesse and his sons to purify themselves, and he invited them to the sacrifice. 
091Sm 16:6 When they arrived, Samuel saw Jesse's son Eliab and said to himself, "This man standing here in the LORD's presence is surely the one he has chosen." 
091Sm 16:7 But the LORD said to him, "Pay no attention to how tall and handsome he is. I have rejected him, because I do not judge as people judge. They look at the outward appearance, but I look at the heart." 
091Sm 16:8 Then Jesse called his son Abinadab and brought him to Samuel. But Samuel said, "No, the LORD hasn't chosen him either." 
091Sm 16:9 Jesse then brought Shammah. "No, the LORD hasn't chosen him either," Samuel said. 
091Sm 16:10 In this way Jesse brought seven of his sons to Samuel. And Samuel said to him, "No, the LORD hasn't chosen any of these." 
091Sm 16:11 Then he asked him, "Do you have any more sons?" Jesse answered, "There is still the youngest, but he is out taking care of the sheep." "Tell him to come here," Samuel said. "We won't offer the sacrifice until he comes." 
091Sm 16:12 So Jesse sent for him. He was a handsome, healthy young man, and his eyes sparkled. The LORD said to Samuel, "This is the one - anoint him!" 
091Sm 16:13 Samuel took the olive oil and anointed David in front of his brothers. Immediately the spirit of the LORD took control of David and was with him from that day on. Then Samuel returned to Ramah. 
091Sm 16:14 The LORD's spirit left Saul, and an evil spirit sent by the LORD tormented him. 
091Sm 16:15 His servants said to him, "We know that an evil spirit sent by God is tormenting you. 
091Sm 16:16 So give us the order, sir, and we will look for a man who knows how to play the harp. Then when the evil spirit comes on you, the man can play his harp, and you will be all right again." 
091Sm 16:17 Saul ordered them, "Find me a man who plays well and bring him to me." 
091Sm 16:18 One of his attendants said, "Jesse of the town of Bethlehem has a son who is a good musician. He is also a brave and handsome man, a good soldier, and an able speaker. The LORD is with him." 
091Sm 16:19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse to say, "Send me your son David, the one who takes care of the sheep." 
091Sm 16:20 Jesse sent David to Saul with a young goat, a donkey loaded with bread, and a leather bag full of wine. 
091Sm 16:21 David came to Saul and entered his service. Saul liked him very much and chose him as the man to carry his weapons. 
091Sm 16:22 Then Saul sent a message to Jesse: "I like David. Let him stay here in my service." 
091Sm 16:23 From then on, whenever the evil spirit sent by God came on Saul, David would get his harp and play it. The evil spirit would leave, and Saul would feel better and be all right again. 
091Sm 17:1 The Philistines gathered for battle in Socoh, a town in Judah; they camped at a place called Ephes Dammim, between Socoh and Azekah. 
091Sm 17:2 Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in Elah Valley, where they got ready to fight the Philistines. 
091Sm 17:3 The Philistines lined up on one hill and the Israelites on another, with a valley between them. 
091Sm 17:4 A man named Goliath, from the city of Gath, came out from the Philistine camp to challenge the Israelites. He was over nine feet tall 
091Sm 17:5 and wore bronze armor that weighed about 125 pounds and a bronze helmet. 
091Sm 17:6 His legs were also protected by bronze armor, and he carried a bronze javelin slung over his shoulder. 
091Sm 17:7 His spear was as thick as the bar on a weaver's loom, and its iron head weighed about fifteen pounds. A soldier walked in front of him carrying his shield. 
091Sm 17:8 Goliath stood and shouted at the Israelites, "What are you doing there, lined up for battle? I am a Philistine, you slaves of Saul! Choose one of your men to fight me. 
091Sm 17:9 If he wins and kills me, we will be your slaves; but if I win and kill him, you will be our slaves. 
091Sm 17:10 Here and now I challenge the Israelite army. I dare you to pick someone to fight me!" 
091Sm 17:11 When Saul and his men heard this, they were terrified. 
091Sm 17:12 David was the son of Jesse, who was an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in Judah. Jesse had eight sons, and at the time Saul was king, he was already a very old man. 
091Sm 17:13 His three oldest sons had gone with Saul to war. The oldest was Eliab, the next was Abinadab, and the third was Shammah. 
091Sm 17:14 David was the youngest son, and while the three oldest brothers stayed with Saul, 
091Sm 17:15 David would go back to Bethlehem from time to time, to take care of his father's sheep. 
091Sm 17:16 Goliath challenged the Israelites every morning and evening for forty days. 
091Sm 17:17 One day Jesse said to David, "Take a half-bushel of this roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and hurry with them to your brothers in the camp. 
091Sm 17:18 And take these ten cheeses to the commanding officer. Find out how your brothers are getting along and bring back something to show that you saw them and that they are well. 
091Sm 17:19 King Saul, your brothers, and all the other Israelites are in Elah Valley fighting the Philistines." 
091Sm 17:20 David got up early the next morning, left someone else in charge of the sheep, took the food, and went as Jesse had told him to. He arrived at the camp just as the Israelites were going out to their battle line, shouting the war cry. 
091Sm 17:21 The Philistine and the Israelite armies took positions for battle, facing each other. 
091Sm 17:22 David left the food with the officer in charge of the supplies, ran to the battle line, went to his brothers, and asked how they were getting along. 
091Sm 17:23 As he was talking with them, Goliath came forward and challenged the Israelites as he had done before. And David heard him. 
091Sm 17:24 When the Israelites saw Goliath, they ran away in terror. 
091Sm 17:25 "Look at him!" they said to each other. "Listen to his challenge! King Saul has promised to give a big reward to the man who kills him; the king will also give him his daughter to marry and will not require his father's family to pay taxes." 
091Sm 17:26 David asked the men who were near him, "What will the man get who kills this Philistine and frees Israel from this disgrace? After all, who is this heathen Philistine to defy the army of the living God?" 
091Sm 17:27 They told him what would be done for the man who killed Goliath. 
091Sm 17:28 Eliab, David's oldest brother, heard David talking to the men. He became angry with David and said, "What are you doing here? Who is taking care of those sheep of yours out there in the wilderness? You smart aleck, you! You just came to watch the fighting!" 
091Sm 17:29 "Now what have I done?" David asked. "Can't I even ask a question?" 
091Sm 17:30 He turned to another man and asked him the same question, and every time he asked, he got the same answer. 
091Sm 17:31 Some men heard what David had said, and they told Saul, who sent for him. 
091Sm 17:32 David said to Saul, "Your Majesty, no one should be afraid of this Philistine! I will go and fight him." 
091Sm 17:33 "No," answered Saul. "How could you fight him? You're just a boy, and he has been a soldier all his life!" 
091Sm 17:34 "Your Majesty," David said, "I take care of my father's sheep. Any time a lion or a bear carries off a lamb, 
091Sm 17:35 I go after it, attack it, and rescue the lamb. And if the lion or bear turns on me, I grab it by the throat and beat it to death. 
091Sm 17:36 I have killed lions and bears, and I will do the same to this heathen Philistine, who has defied the army of the living God. 
091Sm 17:37 The LORD has saved me from lions and bears; he will save me from this Philistine." "All right," Saul answered. "Go, and the LORD be with you." 
091Sm 17:38 He gave his own armor to David for him to wear: a bronze helmet, which he put on David's head, and a coat of armor. 
091Sm 17:39 David strapped Saul's sword over the armor and tried to walk, but he couldn't, because he wasn't used to wearing them. "I can't fight with all this," he said to Saul. "I'm not used to it." So he took it all off. 
091Sm 17:40 He took his shepherd's stick and then picked up five smooth stones from the stream and put them in his bag. With his sling ready, he went out to meet Goliath. 
091Sm 17:41 The Philistine started walking toward David, with his shield bearer walking in front of him. He kept coming closer, 
091Sm 17:42 and when he got a good look at David, he was filled with scorn for him because he was just a nice, good-looking boy. 
091Sm 17:43 He said to David, "What's that stick for? Do you think I'm a dog?" And he called down curses from his god on David. 
091Sm 17:44 "Come on," he challenged David, "and I will give your body to the birds and animals to eat." 
091Sm 17:45 David answered, "You are coming against me with sword, spear, and javelin, but I come against you in the name of the LORD Almighty, the God of the Israelite armies, which you have defied. 
091Sm 17:46 This very day the LORD will put you in my power; I will defeat you and cut off your head. And I will give the bodies of the Philistine soldiers to the birds and animals to eat. Then the whole world will know that Israel has a God, 
091Sm 17:47 and everyone here will see that the LORD does not need swords or spears to save his people. He is victorious in battle, and he will put all of you in our power." 
091Sm 17:48 Goliath started walking toward David again, and David ran quickly toward the Philistine battle line to fight him. 
091Sm 17:49 He reached into his bag and took out a stone, which he slung at Goliath. It hit him on the forehead and broke his skull, and Goliath fell face downward on the ground. 
091Sm 17:50 And so, without a sword, David defeated and killed Goliath with a sling and a stone! 
091Sm 17:51 He ran to him, stood over him, took Goliath's sword out of its sheath, and cut off his head and killed him. When the Philistines saw that their hero was dead, they ran away. 
091Sm 17:52 The men of Israel and Judah shouted and ran after them, pursuing them all the way to Gath and to the gates of Ekron. The Philistines fell wounded all along the road that leads to Shaaraim, as far as Gath and Ekron. 
091Sm 17:53 When the Israelites came back from pursuing the Philistines, they looted their camp. 
091Sm 17:54 David got Goliath's head and took it to Jerusalem, but he kept Goliath's weapons in his own tent. 
091Sm 17:55 When Saul saw David going out to fight Goliath, he asked Abner, the commander of his army, "Abner, whose son is he?" "I have no idea, Your Majesty," Abner answered. 
091Sm 17:56 "Then go and find out," Saul ordered. 
091Sm 17:57 So when David returned to camp after killing Goliath, Abner took him to Saul. David was still carrying Goliath's head. 
091Sm 17:58 Saul asked him, "Young man, whose son are you?" "I am the son of your servant Jesse from Bethlehem," David answered. 
091Sm 18:1 Saul and David finished their conversation. After that, Saul's son Jonathan was deeply attracted to David and came to love him as much as he loved himself. 
091Sm 18:2 Saul kept David with him from that day on and did not let him go back home. 
091Sm 18:3 Jonathan swore eternal friendship with David because of his deep affection for him. 
091Sm 18:4 He took off the robe he was wearing and gave it to David, together with his armor and also his sword, bow, and belt. 
091Sm 18:5 David was successful in all the missions on which Saul sent him, and so Saul made him an officer in his army. This pleased all of Saul's officers and men. 
091Sm 18:6 As David was returning after killing Goliath and as the soldiers were coming back home, women from every town in Israel came out to meet King Saul. They were singing joyful songs, dancing, and playing tambourines and lyres. 
091Sm 18:7 In their celebration the women sang, "Saul has killed thousands, but David tens of thousands." 
091Sm 18:8 Saul did not like this, and he became very angry. He said, "For David they claim tens of thousands, but only thousands for me. They will be making him king next!" 
091Sm 18:9 And so he was jealous and suspicious of David from that day on. 
091Sm 18:10 The next day an evil spirit from God suddenly took control of Saul, and he raved in his house like a madman. David was playing the harp, as he did every day, and Saul was holding a spear. 
091Sm 18:11 "I'll pin him to the wall," Saul said to himself, and he threw the spear at him twice; but David dodged each time. 
091Sm 18:12 Saul was afraid of David because the LORD was with David but had abandoned him. 
091Sm 18:13 So Saul sent him away and put him in command of a thousand men. David led his men in battle 
091Sm 18:14 and was successful in all he did, because the LORD was with him. 
091Sm 18:15 Saul noticed David's success and became even more afraid of him. 
091Sm 18:16 But everyone in Israel and Judah loved David because he was such a successful leader. 
091Sm 18:17 Then Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I will give her to you as your wife on condition that you serve me as a brave and loyal soldier, and fight the LORD's battles." (Saul was thinking that in this way the Philistines would kill David, and he would not have to do it himself.) 
091Sm 18:18 David answered, "Who am I and what is my family that I should become the king's son-in-law?" 
091Sm 18:19 But when the time came for Merab to be given to David, she was given instead to a man named Adriel from Meholah. 
091Sm 18:20 Saul's daughter Michal, however, fell in love with David, and when Saul heard of this, he was pleased. 
091Sm 18:21 He said to himself, "I'll give Michal to David; I will use her to trap him, and he will be killed by the Philistines." So for the second time Saul said to David, "You will be my son-in-law." 
091Sm 18:22 He ordered his officials to speak privately with David and tell him, "The king is pleased with you and all his officials like you; now is a good time for you to marry his daughter." 
091Sm 18:23 So they told this to David, and he answered, "It's a great honor to become the king's son-in-law, too great for someone poor and insignificant like me." 
091Sm 18:24 The officials told Saul what David had said, 
091Sm 18:25 and Saul ordered them to tell David: "All the king wants from you as payment for the bride are the foreskins of a hundred dead Philistines, as revenge on his enemies." (This was how Saul planned to have David killed by the Philistines.) 
091Sm 18:26 Saul's officials reported to David what Saul had said, and David was delighted with the thought of becoming the king's son-in-law. Before the day set for the wedding, 
091Sm 18:27 David and his men went and killed two hundred Philistines. He took their foreskins to the king and counted them all out to him, so that he might become his son-in-law. So Saul had to give his daughter Michal in marriage to David. 
091Sm 18:28 Saul realized clearly that the LORD was with David and also that his daughter Michal loved him. 
091Sm 18:29 So he became even more afraid of David and was his enemy as long as he lived. 
091Sm 18:30 The Philistine armies would come and fight, but in every battle David was more successful than any of Saul's other officers. As a result David became very famous. 
091Sm 19:1 Saul told his son Jonathan and all his officials that he planned to kill David. But Jonathan was very fond of David, 
091Sm 19:2 and so he told him, "My father is trying to kill you. Please be careful tomorrow morning; hide in some secret place and stay there. 
091Sm 19:3 I will go and stand by my father in the field where you are hiding, and I will speak to him about you. If I find out anything, I will let you know." 
091Sm 19:4 Jonathan praised David to Saul and said, "Sir, don't do wrong to your servant David. He has never done you any wrong; on the contrary, everything he has done has been a great help to you. 
091Sm 19:5 He risked his life when he killed Goliath, and the LORD won a great victory for Israel. When you saw it, you were glad. Why, then, do you now want to do wrong to an innocent man and kill David for no reason at all?" 
091Sm 19:6 Saul was convinced by what Jonathan said and made a vow in the LORD's name that he would not kill David. 
091Sm 19:7 So Jonathan called David and told him everything; then he took him to Saul, and David served the king as he had before. 
091Sm 19:8 War with the Philistines broke out again. David attacked them and defeated them so thoroughly that they fled. 
091Sm 19:9 One day an evil spirit from the LORD took control of Saul. He was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was there, playing his harp. 
091Sm 19:10 Saul tried to pin David to the wall with his spear, but David dodged, and the spear stuck in the wall. David ran away and escaped. 
091Sm 19:11 That same night Saul sent some men to watch David's house and kill him the next morning. Michal, David's wife, warned him, "If you don't get away tonight, tomorrow you will be dead." 
091Sm 19:12 She let him down from a window, and he ran away and escaped. 
091Sm 19:13 Then she took the household idol, laid it on the bed, put a pillow made of goats' hair at its head, and put a cover over it. 
091Sm 19:14 When Saul's men came to get David, Michal told them that he was sick. 
091Sm 19:15 But Saul sent them back to see David for themselves. He ordered them, "Carry him here in his bed, and I will kill him." 
091Sm 19:16 They went inside and found the household idol in the bed and the goats' hair pillow at its head. 
091Sm 19:17 Saul asked Michal, "Why have you tricked me like this and let my enemy escape?" She answered, "He said he would kill me if I didn't help him escape." 
091Sm 19:18 David escaped and went to Samuel in Ramah and told him everything that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went to Naioth and stayed there. 
091Sm 19:19 Saul was told that David was in Naioth in Ramah, 
091Sm 19:20 so he sent some men to arrest him. They saw the group of prophets dancing and shouting, with Samuel as their leader. Then the spirit of God took control of Saul's men, and they also began to dance and shout. 
091Sm 19:21 When Saul heard of this, he sent more messengers, and they also began to dance and shout. He sent messengers the third time, and the same thing happened to them. 
091Sm 19:22 Then he himself started out to Ramah. When he came to the large well in Secu, he asked where Samuel and David were and was told that they were at Naioth. 
091Sm 19:23 As he was going there, the spirit of God took control of him also, and he danced and shouted all the way to Naioth. 
091Sm 19:24 He took off his clothes and danced and shouted in Samuel's presence, and lay naked all that day and all that night. (This is how the saying originated, "Has even Saul become a prophet?") 
091Sm 20:1 Then David fled from Naioth in Ramah and went to Jonathan. "What have I done?" he asked. "What crime have I committed? What wrong have I done to your father to make him want to kill me?" 
091Sm 20:2 Jonathan answered, "God forbid that you should die! My father tells me everything he does, important or not, and he would not hide this from me. It just isn't so!" 
091Sm 20:3 But David answered, "Your father knows very well how much you like me, and he has decided not to let you know what he plans to do, because you would be deeply hurt. I swear to you by the living LORD that I am only a step away from death!" 
091Sm 20:4 Jonathan said, "I'll do anything you want." 
091Sm 20:5 "Tomorrow is the New Moon Festival," David replied, "and I am supposed to eat with the king. But if it's all right with you, I will go and hide in the fields until the evening of the day after tomorrow. 
091Sm 20:6 If your father notices that I am not at the table, tell him that I begged your permission to hurry home to Bethlehem, since it's the time for the annual sacrifice there for my whole family. 
091Sm 20:7 If he says, 'All right,' I will be safe; but if he becomes angry, you will know that he is determined to harm me. 
091Sm 20:8 Please do me this favor, and keep the sacred promise you made to me. But if I'm guilty, kill me yourself ! Why take me to your father to be killed?" 
091Sm 20:9 "Don't even think such a thing!" Jonathan answered. "If I knew for sure that my father was determined to harm you, wouldn't I tell you?" 
091Sm 20:10 David then asked, "Who will let me know if your father answers you angrily?" 
091Sm 20:11 "Let's go out to the fields," Jonathan answered. So they went, 
091Sm 20:12 and Jonathan said to David, "May the LORD God of Israel be our witness! At this time tomorrow and on the following day I will question my father. If his attitude toward you is good, I will send you word. 
091Sm 20:13 If he intends to harm you, may the LORD strike me dead if I don't let you know about it and get you safely away. May the LORD be with you as he was with my father! 
091Sm 20:14 And if I remain alive, please keep your sacred promise and be loyal to me; but if I die, 
091Sm 20:15 show the same kind of loyalty to my family forever. And when the LORD has completely destroyed all your enemies, 
091Sm 20:16 may our promise to each other still be unbroken. If it is broken, the LORD will punish you." 
091Sm 20:17 Once again Jonathan made David promise to love him, for Jonathan loved David as much as he loved himself. 
091Sm 20:18 Then Jonathan said to him, "Since tomorrow is the New Moon Festival, your absence will be noticed if you aren't at the meal. 
091Sm 20:19 The day after tomorrow your absence will be noticed even more; so go to the place where you hid yourself the other time, and hide behind the pile of stones there. 
091Sm 20:20 I will then shoot three arrows at it, as though it were a target. 
091Sm 20:21 Then I will tell my servant to go and find them. And if I tell him, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you; get them,' that means that you are safe and can come out. I swear by the living LORD that you will be in no danger. 
091Sm 20:22 But if I tell him, 'The arrows are on the other side of you,' then leave, because the LORD is sending you away. 
091Sm 20:23 As for the promise we have made to each other, the LORD will make sure that we will keep it forever." 
091Sm 20:24 So David hid in the fields. At the New Moon Festival, King Saul came to the meal 
091Sm 20:25 and sat in his usual place by the wall. Abner sat next to him, and Jonathan sat across the table from him. David's place was empty, 
091Sm 20:26 but Saul said nothing that day, because he thought, "Something has happened to him, and he is not ritually pure." 
091Sm 20:27 On the following day, the day after the New Moon Festival, David's place was still empty, and Saul asked Jonathan, "Why didn't David come to the meal either yesterday or today?" 
091Sm 20:28 Jonathan answered, "He begged me to let him go to Bethlehem. 
091Sm 20:29 'Please let me go,' he said, 'because our family is celebrating the sacrificial feast in town, and my brother ordered me to be there. So then, if you are my friend, let me go and see my relatives.' That is why he isn't in his place at your table." 
091Sm 20:30 Saul became furious with Jonathan and said to him, "How rebellious and faithless your mother was! Now I know you are taking sides with David and are disgracing yourself and that mother of yours! 
091Sm 20:31 Don't you realize that as long as David is alive, you will never be king of this country? Now go and bring him here - he must die!" 
091Sm 20:32 "Why should he die?" Jonathan replied. "What has he done?" 
091Sm 20:33 At that, Saul threw his spear at Jonathan to kill him, and Jonathan realized that his father was really determined to kill David. 
091Sm 20:34 Jonathan got up from the table in a rage and ate nothing that day - the second day of the New Moon Festival. He was deeply distressed about David, because Saul had insulted him. 
091Sm 20:35 The following morning Jonathan went to the fields to meet David, as they had agreed. He took a young boy with him 
091Sm 20:36 and said to him, "Run and find the arrows I'm going to shoot." The boy ran, and Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him. 
091Sm 20:37 When the boy reached the place where the arrow had fallen, Jonathan shouted to him, "The arrow is farther on! 
091Sm 20:38 Don't just stand there! Hurry up!" The boy picked up the arrow and returned to his master, 
091Sm 20:39 not knowing what it all meant; only Jonathan and David knew. 
091Sm 20:40 Jonathan gave his weapons to the boy and told him to take them back to town. 
091Sm 20:41 After the boy had left, David got up from behind the pile of stones, fell on his knees and bowed with his face to the ground three times. Both he and Jonathan were crying as they kissed each other; David's grief was even greater than Jonathan's. 
091Sm 20:42 Then Jonathan said to David, "God be with you. The LORD will make sure that you and I, and your descendants and mine, will forever keep the sacred promise we have made to each other." Then David left, and Jonathan went back to the town. 
091Sm 21:1 David went to the priest Ahimelech in Nob. Ahimelech came out trembling to meet him and asked, "Why did you come here all by yourself ?" 
091Sm 21:2 "I am here on the king's business," David answered. "He told me not to let anyone know what he sent me to do. As for my men, I have told them to meet me at a certain place. 
091Sm 21:3 Now, then, what supplies do you have? Give me five loaves of bread or anything else you have." 
091Sm 21:4 The priest said, "I don't have any ordinary bread, only sacred bread; you can have it if your men haven't had sexual relations recently." 
091Sm 21:5 "Of course they haven't," answered David. "My men always keep themselves ritually pure even when we go out on an ordinary mission; how much more this time when we are on a special mission!" 
091Sm 21:6 So the priest gave David the sacred bread, because the only bread he had was the loaves offered to God, which had been removed from the sacred table and replaced by fresh bread. 
091Sm 21:7 (Saul's chief herdsman, Doeg, who was from Edom, happened to be there that day, because he had to fulfill a religious obligation.) 
091Sm 21:8 David said to Ahimelech, "Do you have a spear or a sword you can give me? The king's orders made me leave in such a hurry that I didn't have time to get my sword or any other weapon." 
091Sm 21:9 Ahimelech answered, "I have the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in Elah Valley; it is behind the ephod, wrapped in a cloth. If you want it, take it - it's the only weapon here." "Give it to me," David said. "There is not a better sword anywhere!" 
091Sm 21:10 So David left, fleeing from Saul, and went to King Achish of Gath. 
091Sm 21:11 The king's officials said to Achish, "Isn't this David, the king of his country? This is the man about whom the women sang, as they danced, 'Saul has killed thousands, but David has killed tens of thousands.' " 
091Sm 21:12 Their words made a deep impression on David, and he became very much afraid of King Achish. 
091Sm 21:13 So whenever David was around them, he pretended to be insane and acted like a madman when they tried to restrain him; he would scribble on the city gates and let spit drool down his beard. 
091Sm 21:14 So Achish said to his officials, "Look! The man is crazy! Why did you bring him to me? 
091Sm 21:15 Don't I have enough madmen already? Why bring another one to bother me with his crazy actions right here in my own house?" 
091Sm 22:1 David fled from the city of Gath and went to a cave near the town of Adullam. When his brothers and the rest of the family heard that he was there, they joined him. 
091Sm 22:2 People who were oppressed or in debt or dissatisfied went to him, about four hundred men in all, and he became their leader. 
091Sm 22:3 David went on from there to Mizpah in Moab and said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and mother come and stay with you until I find out what God is going to do for me." 
091Sm 22:4 So David left his parents with the king of Moab, and they stayed there as long as David was hiding out in the cave. 
091Sm 22:5 Then the prophet Gad came to David and said, "Don't stay here; go at once to the land of Judah." So David left and went to the forest of Hereth. 
091Sm 22:6 One day Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under a tamarisk tree on a hill, with his spear in his hand, and all his officers were standing around him. He was told that David and his men had been located, 
091Sm 22:7 and he said to his officers, "Listen, men of Benjamin! Do you think that David will give fields and vineyards to all of you, and make you officers in his army? 
091Sm 22:8 Is that why you are plotting against me? Not one of you told me that my own son had made an alliance with David. No one is concerned about me or tells me that David, one of my own men, is right now looking for a chance to kill me, and that my son has encouraged him!" 
091Sm 22:9 Doeg was standing there with Saul's officers, and he said, "I saw David when he went to Ahimelech son of Ahitub in Nob. 
091Sm 22:10 Ahimelech asked the LORD what David should do, and then he gave David some food and the sword of Goliath the Philistine." 
091Sm 22:11 So King Saul sent for the priest Ahimelech and all his relatives, who were also priests in Nob, and they came to him. 
091Sm 22:12 Saul said to Ahimelech, "Listen, Ahimelech!" "At your service, sir," he answered. 
091Sm 22:13 Saul asked him, "Why are you and David plotting against me? Why did you give him some food and a sword, and consult God for him? Now he has turned against me and is waiting for a chance to kill me!" 
091Sm 22:14 Ahimelech answered, "David is the most faithful officer you have! He is your own son-in-law, captain of your bodyguard, and highly respected by everyone in the royal court. 
091Sm 22:15 Yes, I consulted God for him, and it wasn't the first time. As for plotting against you, Your Majesty must not accuse me or anyone else in my family. I don't know anything about this matter!" 
091Sm 22:16 The king said, "Ahimelech, you and all your relatives must die." 
091Sm 22:17 Then he said to the guards standing near him, "Kill the LORD's priests! They conspired with David and did not tell me that he had run away, even though they knew it all along." But the guards refused to lift a hand to kill the LORD's priests. 
091Sm 22:18 So Saul said to Doeg, "You kill them!" - and Doeg killed them all. On that day he killed eighty-five priests who were qualified to carry the ephod. 
091Sm 22:19 Saul also had all the other inhabitants of Nob, the city of priests, put to death: men and women, children and babies, cattle, donkeys, and sheep - they were all killed. 
091Sm 22:20 But Abiathar, one of Ahimelech's sons, escaped, and went and joined David. 
091Sm 22:21 He told him how Saul had slaughtered the priests of the LORD. 
091Sm 22:22 David said to him, "When I saw Doeg there that day, I knew that he would be sure to tell Saul. So I am responsible for the death of all your relatives. 
091Sm 22:23 Stay with me and don't be afraid. Saul wants to kill both you and me, but you will be safe with me." 
091Sm 23:1 David heard that the Philistines were attacking the town of Keilah and were stealing the newly harvested grain. 
091Sm 23:2 So he asked the LORD, "Shall I go and attack the Philistines?" "Yes," the LORD answered. "Attack them and save Keilah." 
091Sm 23:3 But David's men said to him, "We have enough to be afraid of here in Judah; it will be much worse if we go to Keilah and attack the Philistine forces!" 
091Sm 23:4 So David consulted the LORD again, and the LORD said to him, "Go and attack Keilah, because I will give you victory over the Philistines." 
091Sm 23:5 So David and his men went to Keilah and attacked the Philistines; they killed many of them and took their livestock. And so it was that David saved the town. 
091Sm 23:6 When Abiathar son of Ahimelech escaped and joined David in Keilah, he took the ephod with him. 
091Sm 23:7 Saul was told that David had gone to Keilah, and he said, "God has put him in my power. David has trapped himself by going into a walled town with fortified gates." 
091Sm 23:8 So Saul called his troops to war, to march against Keilah and besiege David and his men. 
091Sm 23:9 When David heard that Saul was planning to attack him, he said to the priest Abiathar, "Bring the ephod here." 
091Sm 23:10 Then David said, " LORD, God of Israel, I have heard that Saul is planning to come to Keilah and destroy it on account of me, your servant. 
091Sm 23:11 Will the citizens of Keilah hand me over to Saul? Will Saul really come, as I have heard? LORD, God of Israel, I beg you to answer me!" The LORD answered, "Saul will come." 
091Sm 23:12 "And will the citizens of Keilah hand my men and me over to Saul?" David asked again. "They will," the LORD answered. 
091Sm 23:13 So David and his men - about six hundred in all - left Keilah at once and kept on the move. When Saul heard that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up his plan. 
091Sm 23:14 David stayed in hiding in the hill country, in the wilderness near Ziph. Saul was always trying to find him, but God did not turn David over to him. 
091Sm 23:15 David saw that Saul was out to kill him. David was at Horesh, in the wilderness near Ziph. 
091Sm 23:16 Jonathan went to him there and encouraged him with assurances of God's protection, 
091Sm 23:17 saying to him, "Don't be afraid. My father Saul won't be able to harm you. He knows very well that you are the one who will be the king of Israel and that I will be next in rank to you." 
091Sm 23:18 The two of them made a sacred promise of friendship to each other. David stayed at Horesh, and Jonathan went home. 
091Sm 23:19 Some people from Ziph went to Saul at Gibeah and said, "David is hiding out in our territory at Horesh on Mount Hachilah, in the southern part of the Judean wilderness. 
091Sm 23:20 We know, Your Majesty, how much you want to capture him; so come to our territory, and we will make sure that you catch him." 
091Sm 23:21 Saul answered, "May the LORD bless you for being so kind to me! 
091Sm 23:22 Go and make sure once more; find out for certain where he is and who has seen him there. I hear that he is very cunning. 
091Sm 23:23 Find out exactly the places where he hides, and be sure to bring back a report to me right away. Then I will go with you, and if he is still in the region, I will hunt him down, even if I have to search the whole land of Judah." 
091Sm 23:24 So they left and returned to Ziph ahead of Saul. David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon, in a desolate valley in the southern part of the Judean wilderness. 
091Sm 23:25 Saul and his men set out to look for David, but he heard about it and went to a rocky hill in the wilderness of Maon and stayed there. When Saul heard about this, he went after David. 
091Sm 23:26 Saul and his men were on one side of the hill, separated from David and his men, who were on the other side. They were hurrying to get away from Saul and his men, who were closing in on them and were about to capture them. 
091Sm 23:27 Just then a messenger arrived and said to Saul, "Come back at once! The Philistines are invading the country!" 
091Sm 23:28 So Saul stopped pursuing David and went to fight the Philistines. That is why that place is called Separation Hill. 
091Sm 23:29 David left and went to the region of Engedi, where he stayed in hiding. 
091Sm 24:1 When Saul came back from fighting the Philistines, he was told that David was in the wilderness near Engedi. 
091Sm 24:2 Saul took three thousand of the best soldiers in Israel and went looking for David and his men east of Wild Goat Rocks. 
091Sm 24:3 He came to a cave close to some sheep pens by the road and went in to relieve himself. It happened to be the very cave in which David and his men were hiding far back in the cave. 
091Sm 24:4 They said to him, "This is your chance! The LORD has told you that he would put your enemy in your power and you could do to him whatever you wanted to." David crept over and cut off a piece of Saul's robe without Saul's knowing it. 
091Sm 24:5 But then David's conscience began to hurt, 
091Sm 24:6 and he said to his men, "May the LORD keep me from doing any harm to my master, whom the LORD chose as king! I must not harm him in the least, because he is the king chosen by the LORD!" 
091Sm 24:7 So David convinced his men that they should not attack Saul. Saul got up, left the cave, and started away. 
091Sm 24:8 Then David went out after him and called to him, "Your Majesty!" Saul turned around, and David bowed down to the ground in respect 
091Sm 24:9 and said, "Why do you listen to people who say that I am trying to harm you? 
091Sm 24:10 You can see for yourself that just now in the cave the LORD put you in my power. Some of my men told me to kill you, but I felt sorry for you and said that I would not harm you in the least, because you are the one whom the LORD chose to be king. 
091Sm 24:11 Look, my father, look at the piece of your robe I am holding! I could have killed you, but instead I only cut this off. This should convince you that I have no thought of rebelling against you or of harming you. You are hunting me down to kill me, even though I have not done you any wrong. 
091Sm 24:12 May the LORD judge which one of us is wrong! May he punish you for your action against me, for I will not harm you in the least. 
091Sm 24:13 You know the old saying, 'Evil is done only by evil people.' And so I will not harm you. 
091Sm 24:14 Look at what the king of Israel is trying to kill! Look at what he is chasing! A dead dog, a flea! 
091Sm 24:15 The LORD will judge, and he will decide which one of us is wrong. May he look into the matter, defend me, and save me from you." 
091Sm 24:16 When David had finished speaking, Saul said, "Is that really you, David my son?" And he started crying. 
091Sm 24:17 Then he said to David, "You are right, and I am wrong. You have been so good to me, while I have done such wrong to you! 
091Sm 24:18 Today you have shown how good you are to me, because you did not kill me, even though the LORD put me in your power. 
091Sm 24:19 How often does someone catch an enemy and then let him get away unharmed? The LORD bless you for what you have done to me today! 
091Sm 24:20 Now I am sure that you will be king of Israel and that the kingdom will continue under your rule. 
091Sm 24:21 But promise me in the LORD's name that you will spare my descendants, so that my name and my family's name will not be completely forgotten." 
091Sm 24:22 David promised that he would. Then Saul went back home, and David and his men went back to their hiding place. 
091Sm 25:1 Samuel died, and all the Israelites came together and mourned for him. Then they buried him at his home in Ramah. After this, David went to the wilderness of Paran. 
091Sm 25:2 There was a man of the clan of Caleb named Nabal, who was from the town of Maon, and who owned land near the town of Carmel. He was a very rich man, the owner of three thousand sheep and one thousand goats. 
091Sm 25:3 His wife Abigail was beautiful and intelligent, but he was a mean, bad-tempered man. Nabal was shearing his sheep in Carmel, 
091Sm 25:4 and David, who was in the wilderness, heard about it, 
091Sm 25:5 so he sent ten young men with orders to go to Carmel, find Nabal, and give him his greetings. 
091Sm 25:6 He instructed them to say to Nabal: "David sends you greetings, my friend, with his best wishes for you, your family, and all that is yours. 
091Sm 25:7 He heard that you were shearing your sheep, and he wants you to know that your shepherds have been with us and we did not harm them. Nothing that belonged to them was stolen all the time they were at Carmel. 
091Sm 25:8 Just ask them, and they will tell you. We have come on a feast day, and David asks you to receive us kindly. Please give what you can to us your servants and to your dear friend David." 
091Sm 25:9 David's men delivered this message to Nabal in David's name. Then they waited there, 
091Sm 25:10 and Nabal finally answered, "David? Who is he? I've never heard of him! The country is full of runaway slaves nowadays! 
091Sm 25:11 I'm not going to take my bread and water, and the animals I have butchered for my sheepshearers, and give them to people who come from I don't know where!" 
091Sm 25:12 David's men went back to him and told him what Nabal had said. 
091Sm 25:13 "Buckle on your swords!" he ordered, and they all did. David also buckled on his sword and left with about four hundred of his men, leaving two hundred behind with the supplies. 
091Sm 25:14 One of Nabal's servants said to Nabal's wife Abigail, "Have you heard? David sent some messengers from the wilderness with greetings for our master, but he insulted them. 
091Sm 25:15 Yet they were very good to us; they never bothered us, and all the time we were with them in the fields, nothing that belonged to us was stolen. 
091Sm 25:16 They protected us day and night the whole time we were with them looking after our flocks. 
091Sm 25:17 Please think this over and decide what to do. This could be disastrous for our master and all his family. He is so mean that he won't listen to anybody!" 
091Sm 25:18 Abigail quickly gathered two hundred loaves of bread, two leather bags full of wine, five roasted sheep, two bushels of roasted grain, a hundred bunches of raisins, and two hundred cakes of dried figs, and loaded them on donkeys. 
091Sm 25:19 Then she said to the servants, "You go on ahead and I will follow you." But she said nothing to her husband. 
091Sm 25:20 She was riding her donkey around a bend on a hillside when suddenly she met David and his men coming toward her. 
091Sm 25:21 David had been thinking, "Why did I ever protect that fellow's property out here in the wilderness? Not a thing that belonged to him was stolen, and this is how he pays me back for the help I gave him! 
091Sm 25:22 May God strike me dead if I don't kill every last one of those men before morning!" 
091Sm 25:23 When Abigail saw David, she quickly dismounted and threw herself on the ground 
091Sm 25:24 at David's feet, and said to him, "Please, sir, listen to me! Let me take the blame. 
091Sm 25:25 Please, don't pay any attention to Nabal, that good-for-nothing! He is exactly what his name means - a fool! I wasn't there when your servants arrived, sir. 
091Sm 25:26 It is the LORD who has kept you from taking revenge and killing your enemies. And now I swear to you by the living LORD that your enemies and all who want to harm you will be punished like Nabal. 
091Sm 25:27 Please, sir, accept this present I have brought you, and give it to your men. 
091Sm 25:28 Please forgive me, sir, for any wrong I have done. The LORD will make you king, and your descendants also, because you are fighting his battles; and you will not do anything evil as long as you live. 
091Sm 25:29 If anyone should attack you and try to kill you, the LORD your God will keep you safe, as someone guards a precious treasure. As for your enemies, however, he will throw them away, as someone hurls stones with a sling. 
091Sm 25:30 And when the LORD has done all the good things he has promised you and has made you king of Israel, 
091Sm 25:31 then you will not have to feel regret or remorse, sir, for having killed without cause or for having taken your own revenge. And when the LORD has blessed you, sir, please do not forget me." 
091Sm 25:32 David said to her, "Praise the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you today to meet me! 
091Sm 25:33 Thank God for your good sense and for what you have done today in keeping me from the crime of murder and from taking my own revenge. 
091Sm 25:34 The LORD has kept me from harming you. But I swear by the living God of Israel that if you had not hurried to meet me, all of Nabal's men would have been dead by morning!" 
091Sm 25:35 Then David accepted what she had brought him and said to her, "Go back home and don't worry. I will do what you want." 
091Sm 25:36 Abigail went back to Nabal, who was at home having a feast fit for a king. He was drunk and in a good mood, so she did not tell him anything until the next morning. 
091Sm 25:37 Then, after he had sobered up, she told him everything. He suffered a stroke and was completely paralyzed. 
091Sm 25:38 Some ten days later the LORD struck Nabal and he died. 
091Sm 25:39 When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, "Praise the LORD! He has taken revenge on Nabal for insulting me and has kept me his servant from doing wrong. The LORD has punished Nabal for his evil." Then David sent a proposal of marriage to Abigail. 
091Sm 25:40 His servants went to her at Carmel and said to her, "David sent us to take you to him to be his wife." 
091Sm 25:41 Abigail bowed down to the ground and said, "I am his servant, ready to wash the feet of his servants." 
091Sm 25:42 She rose quickly and mounted her donkey. Accompanied by her five maids, she went with David's servants and became his wife. 
091Sm 25:43 David had married Ahinoam from Jezreel, and now Abigail also became his wife. 
091Sm 25:44 Meanwhile, Saul had given his daughter Michal, who had been David's wife, to Palti son of Laish, who was from the town of Gallim. 
091Sm 26:1 Some men from Ziph came to Saul at Gibeah and told him that David was hiding on Mount Hachilah at the edge of the Judean wilderness. 
091Sm 26:2 Saul went at once with three thousand of the best soldiers in Israel to the wilderness of Ziph to look for David, 
091Sm 26:3 and camped by the road on Mount Hachilah. David was still in the wilderness, and when he learned that Saul had come to look for him, 
091Sm 26:4 he sent spies and found out that Saul was indeed there. 
091Sm 26:5 He went at once and located the exact place where Saul and Abner son of Ner, commander of Saul's army, slept. Saul slept inside the camp, and his men camped around him. 
091Sm 26:6 Then David asked Ahimelech the Hittite, and Abishai the brother of Joab (their mother was Zeruiah), "Which of you two will go to Saul's camp with me?" "I will," Abishai answered. 
091Sm 26:7 So that night David and Abishai entered Saul's camp and found Saul sleeping in the center of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground near his head. Abner and the troops were sleeping around him. 
091Sm 26:8 Abishai said to David, "God has put your enemy in your power tonight. Now let me plunge his own spear through him and pin him to the ground with just one blow - I won't have to strike twice!" 
091Sm 26:9 But David said, "You must not harm him! The LORD will certainly punish whoever harms his chosen king. 
091Sm 26:10 By the living LORD," David continued, "I know that the LORD himself will kill Saul, either when his time comes to die a natural death or when he dies in battle. 
091Sm 26:11 The LORD forbid that I should try to harm the one whom the LORD has made king! Let's take his spear and his water jar, and go." 
091Sm 26:12 So David took the spear and the water jar from right beside Saul's head, and he and Abishai left. No one saw it or knew what had happened or even woke up - they were all sound asleep, because the LORD had sent a heavy sleep on them all. 
091Sm 26:13 Then David crossed over to the other side of the valley to the top of the hill, a safe distance away, 
091Sm 26:14 and shouted to Saul's troops and to Abner, "Abner! Can you hear me?" "Who is that shouting and waking up the king?" Abner asked. 
091Sm 26:15 David answered, "Abner, aren't you the greatest man in Israel? So why aren't you protecting your master, the king? Just now someone entered the camp to kill your master. 
091Sm 26:16 You failed in your duty, Abner! I swear by the living LORD that all of you deserve to die, because you have not protected your master, whom the LORD made king. Look! Where is the king's spear? Where is the water jar that was right by his head?" 
091Sm 26:17 Saul recognized David's voice and asked, "David, is that you, my son?" "Yes, Your Majesty," David answered. 
091Sm 26:18 And he added, "Why, sir, are you still pursuing me, your servant? What have I done? What crime have I committed? 
091Sm 26:19 Your Majesty, listen to what I have to say. If it is the LORD who has turned you against me, an offering to him will make him change his mind; but if some people have done it, may the LORD's curse fall on them. For they have driven me out from the LORD's land to a country where I can only worship foreign gods. 
091Sm 26:20 Don't let me be killed on foreign soil, away from the LORD. Why should the king of Israel come to kill a flea like me? Why should he hunt me down like a wild bird?" 
091Sm 26:21 Saul answered, "I have done wrong. Come back, David, my son! I will never harm you again, because you have spared my life tonight. I have been a fool! I have done a terrible thing!" 
091Sm 26:22 David replied, "Here is your spear, Your Majesty. Let one of your men come over and get it. 
091Sm 26:23 The LORD rewards those who are faithful and righteous. Today he put you in my power, but I did not harm you, whom the LORD made king. 
091Sm 26:24 Just as I have spared your life today, may the LORD do the same to me and free me from all troubles!" 
091Sm 26:25 Saul said to David, "God bless you, my son! You will succeed in everything you do!" So David went on his way, and Saul returned home. 
091Sm 27:1 David said to himself, "One of these days Saul will kill me. The best thing for me to do is to escape to Philistia. Then Saul will give up looking for me in Israel, and I will be safe." 
091Sm 27:2 So David and his six hundred men went over at once to Achish son of Maoch, king of Gath. 
091Sm 27:3 David and his men settled there in Gath with their families. David had his two wives with him, Ahinoam from Jezreel, and Abigail, Nabal's widow, from Carmel. 
091Sm 27:4 When Saul heard that David had fled to Gath, he gave up trying to find him. 
091Sm 27:5 David said to Achish, "If you are my friend, let me have a small town to live in. There is no need, sir, for me to live with you in the capital city." 
091Sm 27:6 So Achish gave him the town of Ziklag, and for this reason Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah ever since. 
091Sm 27:7 David lived in Philistia for sixteen months. 
091Sm 27:8 During that time David and his men would attack the people of Geshur, Girzi, and Amalek, who had been living in the region a very long time. He would raid their land as far as Shur, all the way down to Egypt, 
091Sm 27:9 killing all the men and women and taking the sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and even the clothes. Then he would come back to Achish, 
091Sm 27:10 who would ask him, "Where did you go on a raid this time?" and David would tell him that he had gone to the southern part of Judah or to the territory of the clan of Jerahmeel or to the territory where the Kenites lived. 
091Sm 27:11 David would kill everyone, men and women, so that no one could go back to Gath and report what he and his men had really done. This is what David did the whole time he lived in Philistia. 
091Sm 27:12 But Achish trusted David and said to himself, "He is hated so much by his own people the Israelites that he will have to serve me all his life." 
091Sm 28:1 Some time later the Philistines gathered their troops to fight Israel, and Achish said to David, "Of course you understand that you and your men are to fight on my side." 
091Sm 28:2 "Of course," David answered. "I am your servant, and you will see for yourself what I can do." Achish said, "Good! I will make you my permanent bodyguard." 
091Sm 28:3 Now Samuel had died, and all the Israelites had mourned for him and had buried him in his hometown of Ramah. Saul had forced all the fortunetellers and mediums to leave Israel. 
091Sm 28:4 The Philistine troops assembled and camped near the town of Shunem; Saul gathered the Israelites and camped at Mount Gilboa. 
091Sm 28:5 When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was terrified, 
091Sm 28:6 and so he asked the LORD what to do. But the LORD did not answer him at all, either by dreams or by the use of Urim and Thummim or by prophets. 
091Sm 28:7 Then Saul ordered his officials, "Find me a woman who is a medium, and I will go and consult her." "There is one in Endor," they answered. 
091Sm 28:8 So Saul disguised himself; he put on different clothes, and after dark he went with two of his men to see the woman. "Consult the spirits for me and tell me what is going to happen," he said to her. "Call up the spirit of the man I name." 
091Sm 28:9 The woman answered, "Surely you know what King Saul has done, how he forced the fortunetellers and mediums to leave Israel. Why, then, are you trying to trap me and get me killed?" 
091Sm 28:10 Then Saul made a sacred vow. "By the living LORD I promise that you will not be punished for doing this," he told her. 
091Sm 28:11 "Whom shall I call up for you?" the woman asked. "Samuel," he answered. 
091Sm 28:12 When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed and said to Saul, "Why have you tricked me? You are King Saul!" 
091Sm 28:13 "Don't be afraid!" the king said to her. "What do you see?" "I see a spirit coming up from the earth," she answered. 
091Sm 28:14 "What does it look like?" he asked. "It's an old man coming up," she answered. "He is wearing a cloak." Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed to the ground in respect. 
091Sm 28:15 Samuel said to Saul, "Why have you disturbed me? Why did you make me come back?" Saul answered, "I am in great trouble! The Philistines are at war with me, and God has abandoned me. He doesn't answer me any more, either by prophets or by dreams. And so I have called you, for you to tell me what I must do." 
091Sm 28:16 Samuel said, "Why do you call me when the LORD has abandoned you and become your enemy? 
091Sm 28:17 The LORD has done to you what he told you through me: he has taken the kingdom away from you and given it to David instead. 
091Sm 28:18 You disobeyed the LORD's command and did not completely destroy the Amalekites and all they had. That is why the LORD is doing this to you now. 
091Sm 28:19 He will give you and Israel over to the Philistines. Tomorrow you and your sons will join me, and the LORD will also give the army of Israel over to the Philistines." 
091Sm 28:20 At once Saul fell down and lay stretched out on the ground, terrified by what Samuel had said. He was weak, because he had not eaten anything all day and all night. 
091Sm 28:21 The woman went over to him and saw that he was terrified, so she said to him, "Please, sir, I risked my life by doing what you asked. 
091Sm 28:22 Now please do what I ask. Let me fix you some food. You must eat so that you will be strong enough to travel." 
091Sm 28:23 Saul refused and said he would not eat anything. But his officers also urged him to eat. He finally gave in, got up from the ground, and sat on the bed. 
091Sm 28:24 The woman quickly killed a calf which she had been fattening. Then she took some flour, prepared it, and baked some bread without yeast. 
091Sm 28:25 She set the food before Saul and his officers, and they ate it. And they left that same night. 
091Sm 29:1 The Philistines brought all their troops together at Aphek, while the Israelites camped at the spring in Jezreel Valley. 
091Sm 29:2 The five Philistine kings marched out with their units of a hundred and of a thousand men; David and his men marched in the rear with King Achish. 
091Sm 29:3 The Philistine commanders saw them and asked, "What are these Hebrews doing here?" Achish answered, "This is David, an official of King Saul of Israel. He has been with me for quite some time now. He has done nothing I can find fault with since the day he came over to me." 
091Sm 29:4 But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and said to him, "Send that fellow back to the town you gave him. Don't let him go into battle with us; he might turn against us during the fighting. What better way is there for him to win back his master's favor than by the death of our men? 
091Sm 29:5 After all, this is David, the one about whom the women sang, as they danced, 'Saul has killed thousands, but David has killed tens of thousands.' " 
091Sm 29:6 Achish called David and said to him, "I swear by the living God of Israel that you have been loyal to me; and I would be pleased to have you go with me and fight in this battle. I have not found any fault in you from the day you came over to me. But the other kings don't approve of you. 
091Sm 29:7 So go back home in peace, and don't do anything that would displease them." 
091Sm 29:8 David answered, "What have I done wrong, sir? If, as you say, you haven't found any fault in me since the day I started serving you, why shouldn't I go with you, my master and king, and fight your enemies?" 
091Sm 29:9 "I agree," Achish replied. "I consider you as loyal as an angel of God. But the other kings have said that you can't go with us into battle. 
091Sm 29:10 So then, David, tomorrow morning all of you who left Saul and came over to me will have to get up early and leave as soon as it's light." 
091Sm 29:11 So David and his men started out early the following morning to go back to Philistia, and the Philistines went on to Jezreel. 
091Sm 30:1 Two days later David and his men arrived back at Ziklag. The Amalekites had raided southern Judah and attacked Ziklag. They had burned down the town 
091Sm 30:2 and captured all the women; they had not killed anyone, but had taken everyone with them when they left. 
091Sm 30:3 When David and his men arrived, they found that the town had been burned down and that their wives, sons, and daughters had been carried away. 
091Sm 30:4 David and his men started crying and did not stop until they were completely exhausted. 
091Sm 30:5 Even David's two wives, Ahinoam and Abigail, had been taken away. 
091Sm 30:6 David was now in great trouble, because his men were all very bitter about losing their children, and they were threatening to stone him; but the LORD his God gave him courage. 
091Sm 30:7 David said to the priest Abiathar son of Ahimelech, "Bring me the ephod," and Abiathar brought it to him. 
091Sm 30:8 David asked the LORD, "Shall I go after those raiders? And will I catch them?" He answered, "Go after them; you will catch them and rescue the captives." 
091Sm 30:9 So David and his six hundred men started out, and when they arrived at Besor Brook, some of them stayed there. 
091Sm 30:10 David continued on his way with four hundred men; the other two hundred men were too tired to cross the brook and so stayed behind. 
091Sm 30:11 The men with David found a young Egyptian out in the country and brought him to David. They gave him some food and water, 
091Sm 30:12 some dried figs, and two bunches of raisins. After he had eaten, his strength returned; he had not had anything to eat or drink for three full days. 
091Sm 30:13 David asked him, "Who is your master, and where are you from?" "I am an Egyptian, the slave of an Amalekite," he answered. "My master left me behind three days ago because I got sick. 
091Sm 30:14 We had raided the territory of the Cherethites in the southern part of Judah and the territory of the clan of Caleb, and we burned down Ziklag." 
091Sm 30:15 "Will you lead me to those raiders?" David asked him. He answered, "I will if you promise me in God's name that you will not kill me or hand me over to my master." 
091Sm 30:16 And he led David to them. The raiders were scattered all over the place, eating, drinking, and celebrating because of the enormous amount of loot they had captured from Philistia and Judah. 
091Sm 30:17 At dawn the next day David attacked them and fought until evening. Except for four hundred young men who mounted camels and got away, none of them escaped. 
091Sm 30:18 David rescued everyone and everything the Amalekites had taken, including his two wives; 
091Sm 30:19 nothing at all was missing. David got back all his men's sons and daughters, and all the loot the Amalekites had taken. 
091Sm 30:20 He also recovered all the flocks and herds; his men drove all the livestock in front of them and said, "This belongs to David!" 
091Sm 30:21 Then David went back to the two hundred men who had been too weak to go with him and had stayed behind at Besor Brook. They came forward to meet David and his men, and David went up to them and greeted them warmly. 
091Sm 30:22 But some mean and worthless men who had gone with David said, "They didn't go with us, and so we won't give them any of the loot. They can take their wives and children and go away." 
091Sm 30:23 But David answered, "My brothers, you can't do this with what the LORD has given us! He kept us safe and gave us victory over the raiders. 
091Sm 30:24 No one can agree with what you say! All must share alike: whoever stays behind with the supplies gets the same share as the one who goes into battle." 
091Sm 30:25 David made this a rule, and it has been followed in Israel ever since. 
091Sm 30:26 When David returned to Ziklag, he sent part of the loot to his friends, the leaders of Judah, with the message, "Here is a present for you from the loot we took from the LORD's enemies." 
091Sm 30:27 He sent it to the people in Bethel, to the people in Ramah in the southern part of Judah, and to the people in the towns of Jattir, 
091Sm 30:28 Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
091Sm 30:29 and Racal; to the clan of Jerahmeel, to the Kenites, 
091Sm 30:30 and to the people in the towns of Hormah, Borashan, Athach, 
091Sm 30:31 and Hebron. He sent it to all the places where he and his men had roamed. 
091Sm 31:1 The Philistines fought a battle against the Israelites on Mount Gilboa. Many Israelites were killed there, and the rest of them, including King Saul and his sons, fled. 
091Sm 31:2 But the Philistines caught up with them and killed three of Saul's sons, Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua. 
091Sm 31:3 The fighting was heavy around Saul, and he himself was hit by enemy arrows and badly wounded. 
091Sm 31:4 He said to the young man carrying his weapons, "Draw your sword and kill me, so that these godless Philistines won't gloat over me and kill me." But the young man was too terrified to do it. So Saul took his own sword and threw himself on it. 
091Sm 31:5 The young man saw that Saul was dead, so he too threw himself on his own sword and died with Saul. 
091Sm 31:6 And that is how Saul, his three sons, and the young man died; all of Saul's men died that day. 
091Sm 31:7 When the Israelites on the other side of Jezreel Valley and east of the Jordan River heard that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons had been killed, they abandoned their towns and fled. Then the Philistines came and occupied the towns. 
091Sm 31:8 The day after the battle the Philistines went to plunder the corpses, and they found the bodies of Saul and his three sons lying on Mount Gilboa. 
091Sm 31:9 They cut off Saul's head, stripped off his armor, and sent messengers with them throughout Philistia to tell the good news to their idols and to their people. 
091Sm 31:10 Then they put his weapons in the temple of the goddess Astarte, and they nailed his body to the wall of the city of Beth Shan. 
091Sm 31:11 When the people of Jabesh in Gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
091Sm 31:12 the bravest men started out and marched all night to Beth Shan. They took down the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall, brought them back to Jabesh, and burned them there. 
091Sm 31:13 Then they took the bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree in town, and fasted for seven days.

102Sm 1:1 After Saul's death David came back from his victory over the Amalekites and stayed in Ziklag for two days. 
102Sm 1:2 The next day a young man arrived from Saul's camp. To show his grief, he had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head. He went to David and bowed to the ground in respect. 
102Sm 1:3 David asked him, "Where have you come from?" "I have escaped from the Israelite camp," he answered. 
102Sm 1:4 "Tell me what happened," David said. "Our army ran away from the battle," he replied, "and many of our men were killed. Saul and his son Jonathan were also killed." 
102Sm 1:5 "How do you know that Saul and Jonathan are dead?" David asked him. 
102Sm 1:6 He answered, "I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and I saw that Saul was leaning on his spear and that the chariots and cavalry of the enemy were closing in on him. 
102Sm 1:7 Then he turned around, saw me, and called to me. I answered, 'Yes, sir!' 
102Sm 1:8 He asked who I was, and I told him that I was an Amalekite. 
102Sm 1:9 Then he said, 'Come here and kill me! I have been badly wounded, and I'm about to die.' 
102Sm 1:10 So I went up to him and killed him, because I knew that he would die anyway as soon as he fell. Then I took the crown from his head and the bracelet from his arm, and I have brought them to you, sir." 
102Sm 1:11 David tore his clothes in sorrow, and all his men did the same. 
102Sm 1:12 They grieved and mourned and fasted until evening for Saul and Jonathan and for Israel, the people of the LORD, because so many had been killed in battle. 
102Sm 1:13 David asked the young man who had brought him the news, "Where are you from?" He answered, "I'm an Amalekite, but I live in your country." 
102Sm 1:14 David asked him, "How is it that you dared kill the LORD's chosen king?" 
102Sm 1:15 Then David called one of his men and said, "Kill him!" The man struck the Amalekite and mortally wounded him, 
102Sm 1:16 and David said to the Amalekite, "You brought this on yourself. You condemned yourself when you confessed that you killed the one whom the LORD chose to be king." 
102Sm 1:17 David sang this lament for Saul and his son Jonathan, 
102Sm 1:18 and ordered it to be taught to the people of Judah. (It is recorded in {\I The Book of Jashar.)
102Sm 1:19 "On the hills of Israel our leaders are dead! The bravest of our soldiers have fallen! 
102Sm 1:20 Do not announce it in Gath or in the streets of Ashkelon. Do not make the women of Philistia glad; do not let the daughters of pagans rejoice. 
102Sm 1:21 "May no rain or dew fall on Gilboa's hills; may its fields be always barren! For the shields of the brave lie there in disgrace; the shield of Saul is no longer polished with oil. 
102Sm 1:22 Jonathan's bow was deadly, the sword of Saul was merciless, striking down the mighty, killing the enemy. 
102Sm 1:23 "Saul and Jonathan, so wonderful and dear; together in life, together in death; swifter than eagles, stronger than lions. 
102Sm 1:24 "Women of Israel, mourn for Saul! He clothed you in rich scarlet dresses and adorned you with jewels and gold. 
102Sm 1:25 "The brave soldiers have fallen, they were killed in battle. Jonathan lies dead in the hills. 
102Sm 1:26 "I grieve for you, my brother Jonathan; how dear you were to me! How wonderful was your love for me, better even than the love of women. 
102Sm 1:27 "The brave soldiers have fallen, their weapons abandoned and useless." 
102Sm 2:1 After this, David asked the LORD, "Shall I go and take control of one of the towns of Judah?" "Yes," the LORD answered. "Which one?" David asked. "Hebron," the LORD said. 
102Sm 2:2 So David went to Hebron, taking with him his two wives: Ahinoam, who was from Jezreel, and Abigail, Nabal's widow, who was from Carmel. 
102Sm 2:3 He also took his men and their families, and they settled in the towns around Hebron. 
102Sm 2:4 Then the men of Judah came to Hebron and anointed David as king of Judah. When David heard that the people of Jabesh in Gilead had buried Saul, 
102Sm 2:5 he sent some men there with the message: "May the LORD bless you for showing your loyalty to your king by burying him. 
102Sm 2:6 And now may the LORD be kind and faithful to you. I too will treat you well because of what you have done. 
102Sm 2:7 Be strong and brave! Saul your king is dead, and the people of Judah have anointed me as their king." 
102Sm 2:8 The commander of Saul's army, Abner son of Ner, had fled with Saul's son Ishbosheth across the Jordan to Mahanaim. 
102Sm 2:9 There Abner made Ishbosheth king of the territories of Gilead, Asher, Jezreel, Ephraim, and Benjamin, and indeed over all Israel. 
102Sm 2:10 He was forty years old when he was made king of Israel, and he ruled for two years. But the tribe of Judah was loyal to David, 
102Sm 2:11 and he ruled in Hebron over Judah for seven and a half years. 
102Sm 2:12 Abner and the officials of Ishbosheth went from Mahanaim to the city of Gibeon. 
102Sm 2:13 Joab, whose mother was Zeruiah, and David's other officials met them at the pool, where they all sat down, one group on one side of the pool and the other group on the opposite side. 
102Sm 2:14 Abner said to Joab, "Let's have some of the young men from each side fight an armed contest." "All right," Joab answered. 
102Sm 2:15 So twelve men, representing Ishbosheth and the tribe of Benjamin, fought twelve of David's men. 
102Sm 2:16 Each man caught his opponent by the head and plunged his sword into his opponent's side, so that all twenty-four of them fell down dead together. And so that place in Gibeon is called "Field of Swords." 
102Sm 2:17 Then a furious battle broke out, and Abner and the Israelites were defeated by David's men. 
102Sm 2:18 The three sons of Zeruiah were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Asahel, who could run as fast as a wild deer, 
102Sm 2:19 started chasing Abner, running straight for him. 
102Sm 2:20 Abner looked back and said, "Is that you, Asahel?" "Yes," he answered. 
102Sm 2:21 "Stop chasing me!" Abner said. "Run after one of the soldiers and take what he has." But Asahel kept on chasing him. 
102Sm 2:22 Once more Abner said to him, "Stop chasing me! Why force me to kill you? How could I face your brother Joab?" 
102Sm 2:23 But Asahel would not quit; so Abner, with a backward thrust of his spear, struck him through the stomach so that the spear came out at his back. Asahel dropped to the ground dead, and everyone who came to the place where he was lying stopped and stood there. 
102Sm 2:24 But Joab and Abishai started out after Abner, and at sunset they came to the hill of Ammah, which is to the east of Giah on the road to the wilderness of Gibeon. 
102Sm 2:25 The men from the tribe of Benjamin gathered around Abner again and took their stand on the top of a hill. 
102Sm 2:26 Abner called out to Joab, "Do we have to go on fighting forever? Can't you see that in the end there will be nothing but bitterness? We are your relatives. How long will it be before you order your men to stop chasing us?" 
102Sm 2:27 "I swear by the living God," Joab answered, "that if you had not spoken, my men would have kept on chasing you until tomorrow morning." 
102Sm 2:28 Then Joab blew the trumpet as a signal for his men to stop pursuing the Israelites; and so the fighting stopped. 
102Sm 2:29 Abner and his men marched through the Jordan Valley all that night; they crossed the Jordan River, and after marching all the next morning, they arrived back at Mahanaim. 
102Sm 2:30 When Joab gave up the chase, he gathered all his men and found that nineteen of them were missing, in addition to Asahel. 
102Sm 2:31 David's men had killed 360 of Abner's men from the tribe of Benjamin. 
102Sm 2:32 Joab and his men took Asahel's body and buried it in the family tomb at Bethlehem. Then they marched all night and at dawn arrived back at Hebron. 
102Sm 3:1 The fighting between the forces supporting Saul's family and those supporting David went on for a long time. As David became stronger and stronger, his opponents became weaker and weaker. 
102Sm 3:2 The following six sons, in order of their birth, were born to David at Hebron: Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam, from Jezreel; 
102Sm 3:3 Chileab, whose mother was Abigail, Nabal's widow, from Carmel; Absalom, whose mother was Maacah, the daughter of King Talmai of Geshur; 
102Sm 3:4 Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith; Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital; 
102Sm 3:5 Ithream, whose mother was Eglah. All of these sons were born in Hebron. 
102Sm 3:6 As the fighting continued between David's forces and the forces loyal to Saul's family, Abner became more and more powerful among Saul's followers. 
102Sm 3:7 One day Ishbosheth son of Saul accused Abner of sleeping with Saul's concubine Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah. 
102Sm 3:8 This made Abner furious. "Do you think that I would betray Saul? Do you really think I'm serving Judah?" he exclaimed. "From the very first I have been loyal to the cause of your father Saul, his brothers, and his friends, and I have kept you from being defeated by David; yet today you find fault with me about a woman! 
102Sm 3:9 The LORD promised David that he would take the kingdom away from Saul and his descendants and would make David king of both Israel and Judah, from one end of the country to the other. 
102Sm 3:10 Now may God strike me dead if I don't make this come true!" 
102Sm 3:11 Ishbosheth was so afraid of Abner that he could not say a word. 
102Sm 3:12 Abner sent messengers to David, who at that time was at Hebron, to say, "Who is going to rule this land? Make an agreement with me, and I will help you win all Israel over to your side." 
102Sm 3:13 "Good!" David answered. "I will make an agreement with you on one condition: you must bring Saul's daughter Michal to me when you come to see me." 
102Sm 3:14 And David also sent messengers to Ishbosheth to say, "Give me back my wife Michal. I paid a hundred Philistine foreskins in order to marry her." 
102Sm 3:15 So Ishbosheth had her taken from her husband Paltiel son of Laish. 
102Sm 3:16 Paltiel followed her all the way to the town of Bahurim, crying as he went. But when Abner said, "Go back home," he did. 
102Sm 3:17 Abner went to the leaders of Israel and said to them, "For a long time you have wanted David to be your king. 
102Sm 3:18 Now here is your chance. Remember that the LORD has said, 'I will use my servant David to rescue my people Israel from the Philistines and from all their other enemies.' " 
102Sm 3:19 Abner spoke also to the people of the tribe of Benjamin and then went to Hebron to tell David what the people of Benjamin and of Israel had agreed to do. 
102Sm 3:20 When Abner came to David at Hebron with twenty men, David gave a feast for them. 
102Sm 3:21 Abner told David, "I will go now and win all Israel over to Your Majesty. They will accept you as king, and then you will get what you have wanted and will rule over the whole land." David gave Abner a guarantee of safety and sent him on his way. 
102Sm 3:22 Later on Joab and David's other officials returned from a raid, bringing a large amount of loot with them. Abner, however, was no longer there at Hebron with David, because David had sent him away with a guarantee of safety. 
102Sm 3:23 When Joab and his men arrived, he was told that Abner had come to King David and had been sent away with a guarantee of safety. 
102Sm 3:24 So Joab went to the king and said to him, "What have you done? Abner came to you - why did you let him go like that? 
102Sm 3:25 He came here to deceive you and to find out everything you do and everywhere you go. Surely you know that!" 
102Sm 3:26 After leaving David, Joab sent messengers to get Abner, and they brought him back from Sirah Well; but David knew nothing about it. 
102Sm 3:27 When Abner arrived in Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gate, as though he wanted to speak privately with him, and there he stabbed him in the stomach. And so Abner was murdered because he had killed Joab's brother Asahel. 
102Sm 3:28 When David heard the news, he said, "The LORD knows that my subjects and I are completely innocent of the murder of Abner. 
102Sm 3:29 May the punishment for it fall on Joab and all his family! In every generation may there be some man in his family who has gonorrhea or a dreaded skin disease or is fit only to do a woman's work or is killed in battle or doesn't have enough to eat!" 
102Sm 3:30 So Joab and his brother Abishai took revenge on Abner for killing their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon. 
102Sm 3:31 Then David ordered Joab and his men to tear their clothes, wear sackcloth, and mourn for Abner. And at the funeral King David himself walked behind the coffin. 
102Sm 3:32 Abner was buried at Hebron, and the king wept aloud at the grave, and so did all the people. 
102Sm 3:33 David sang this lament for Abner: "Why did Abner have to die like a fool? 
102Sm 3:34 His hands were not tied, And his feet were not bound; He died like someone killed by criminals!" And the people wept for him again. 
102Sm 3:35 All day long the people tried to get David to eat something, but he made a solemn promise, "May God strike me dead if I eat anything before the day is over!" 
102Sm 3:36 They took note of this and were pleased. Indeed, everything the king did pleased the people. 
102Sm 3:37 All of David's people and all the people in Israel understood that the king had no part in the murder of Abner. 
102Sm 3:38 The king said to his officials, "Don't you realize that this day a great leader in Israel has died? 
102Sm 3:39 Even though I am the king chosen by God, I feel weak today. These sons of Zeruiah are too violent for me. May the LORD punish these criminals as they deserve!" 
102Sm 4:1 When Saul's son Ishbosheth heard that Abner had been killed in Hebron, he was afraid, and all the people of Israel were alarmed. 
102Sm 4:2 Ishbosheth had two officers who were leaders of raiding parties, Baanah and Rechab, sons of Rimmon, from Beeroth in the tribe of Benjamin. (Beeroth is counted as part of Benjamin. 
102Sm 4:3 Its original inhabitants had fled to Gittaim, where they have lived ever since.) 
102Sm 4:4 Another descendant of Saul was Jonathan's son Mephibosheth, who was five years old when Saul and Jonathan were killed. When the news about their death came from the city of Jezreel, his nurse picked him up and fled; but she was in such a hurry that she dropped him, and he became crippled. 
102Sm 4:5 Rechab and Baanah set out for Ishbosheth's house and arrived there about noon, while he was taking his midday rest. 
102Sm 4:6 The woman at the door had become drowsy while she was sifting wheat and had fallen asleep, so Rechab and Baanah slipped in. 
102Sm 4:7 Once inside, they went to Ishbosheth's bedroom, where he was sound asleep, and killed him. Then they cut off his head, took it with them, and walked all night through the Jordan Valley. 
102Sm 4:8 They presented the head to King David at Hebron and said to him, "Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your enemy Saul, who tried to kill you. Today the LORD has allowed Your Majesty to take revenge on Saul and his descendants." 
102Sm 4:9 David answered them, "I take a vow by the living LORD, who has saved me from all dangers! 
102Sm 4:10 The messenger who came to me at Ziklag and told me of Saul's death thought he was bringing good news. I seized him and had him put to death. That was the reward I gave him for his good news! 
102Sm 4:11 How much worse it will be for evil men who murder an innocent man asleep in his own house! I will now take revenge on you for murdering him and will wipe you off the face of the earth!" 
102Sm 4:12 David gave the order, and his soldiers killed Rechab and Baanah and cut off their hands and feet, which they hung up near the pool in Hebron. They took Ishbosheth's head and buried it in Abner's tomb there at Hebron. 
102Sm 5:1 Then all the tribes of Israel went to David at Hebron and said to him, "We are your own flesh and blood. 
102Sm 5:2 In the past, even when Saul was still our king, you led the people of Israel in battle, and the LORD promised you that you would lead his people and be their ruler." 
102Sm 5:3 So all the leaders of Israel came to King David at Hebron. He made a sacred alliance with them, they anointed him, and he became king of Israel. 
102Sm 5:4 David was thirty years old when he became king, and he ruled for forty years. 
102Sm 5:5 He ruled in Hebron over Judah for seven and a half years, and in Jerusalem over all Israel and Judah for thirty-three years. 
102Sm 5:6 The time came when King David and his men set out to attack Jerusalem. The Jebusites, who lived there, thought that David would not be able to conquer the city, and so they said to him, "You will never get in here; even the blind and the crippled could keep you out." 
102Sm 5:7 (But David did capture their fortress of Zion, and it became known as "David's City.") 
102Sm 5:8 That day David said to his men, "Does anybody here hate the Jebusites as much as I do? Enough to kill them? Then go up through the water tunnel and attack those poor blind cripples." (That is why it is said, "The blind and the crippled cannot enter the LORD's house.") 
102Sm 5:9 After capturing the fortress, David lived in it and named it "David's City." He built the city around it, starting at the place where land was filled in on the east side of the hill. 
102Sm 5:10 He grew stronger all the time, because the LORD God Almighty was with him. 
102Sm 5:11 King Hiram of Tyre sent a trade mission to David; he provided him with cedar logs and with carpenters and stone masons to build a palace. 
102Sm 5:12 And so David realized that the LORD had established him as king of Israel and was making his kingdom prosperous for the sake of his people. 
102Sm 5:13 After moving from Hebron to Jerusalem, David took more concubines and wives, and had more sons and daughters. 
102Sm 5:14 The following children were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
102Sm 5:15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
102Sm 5:16 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet. 
102Sm 5:17 The Philistines were told that David had been made king of Israel, so their army set out to capture him. When David heard of it, he went down to a fortified place. 
102Sm 5:18 The Philistines arrived at Rephaim Valley and occupied it. 
102Sm 5:19 David asked the LORD, "Shall I attack the Philistines? Will you give me the victory?" "Yes, attack!" the LORD answered. "I will give you the victory!" 
102Sm 5:20 So David went to Baal Perazim and there he defeated the Philistines. He said, "The LORD has broken through my enemies like a flood." And so that place is called Baal Perazim. 
102Sm 5:21 When the Philistines fled, they left their idols behind, and David and his men carried them away. 
102Sm 5:22 Then the Philistines went back to Rephaim Valley and occupied it again. 
102Sm 5:23 Once more David consulted the LORD, who answered, "Don't attack them from here, but go around and get ready to attack them from the other side, near the balsam trees. 
102Sm 5:24 When you hear the sound of marching in the treetops, then attack because I will be marching ahead of you to defeat the Philistine army." 
102Sm 5:25 David did what the LORD had commanded, and was able to drive the Philistines back from Geba all the way to Gezer. 
102Sm 6:1 Once more David called together the best soldiers in Israel, a total of thirty thousand men, 
102Sm 6:2 and led them to Baalah in Judah, in order to bring from there God's Covenant Box, bearing the name of the LORD Almighty, whose throne is above the winged creatures. 
102Sm 6:3 They took it from Abinadab's home on the hill and placed it on a new cart. Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were guiding the cart, 
102Sm 6:4 with Ahio walking in front. 
102Sm 6:5 David and all the Israelites were dancing and singing with all their might to honor the LORD. They were playing harps, lyres, drums, rattles, and cymbals. 
102Sm 6:6 As they came to the threshing place of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out and took hold of the Covenant Box. 
102Sm 6:7 At once the LORD God became angry with Uzzah and killed him because of his irreverence. Uzzah died there beside the Covenant Box, 
102Sm 6:8 and so that place has been called Perez Uzzah ever since. David was furious because the LORD had punished Uzzah in anger. 
102Sm 6:9 Then David was afraid of the LORD and said, "How can I take the Covenant Box with me now?" 
102Sm 6:10 So he decided not to take it with him to Jerusalem; instead, he turned off the road and took it to the house of Obed Edom, a native of the city of Gath. 
102Sm 6:11 It stayed there three months, and the LORD blessed Obed Edom and his family. 
102Sm 6:12 King David heard that because of the Covenant Box the LORD had blessed Obed Edom's family and all that he had; so he got the Covenant Box from Obed's house to take it to Jerusalem with a great celebration. 
102Sm 6:13 After the men carrying the Covenant Box had gone six steps, David had them stop while he offered the LORD a sacrifice of a bull and a fattened calf. 
102Sm 6:14 David, wearing only a linen cloth around his waist, danced with all his might to honor the LORD. 
102Sm 6:15 And so he and all the Israelites took the Covenant Box up to Jerusalem with shouts of joy and the sound of trumpets. 
102Sm 6:16 As the Box was being brought into the city, Michal, Saul's daughter, looked out of the window and saw King David dancing and jumping around in the sacred dance, and she was disgusted with him. 
102Sm 6:17 They brought the Box and put it in its place in the Tent that David had set up for it. Then he offered sacrifices and fellowship offerings to the LORD. 
102Sm 6:18 When he had finished offering the sacrifices, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD Almighty 
102Sm 6:19 and distributed food to them all. He gave each man and woman in Israel a loaf of bread, a piece of roasted meat, and some raisins. Then everyone went home. 
102Sm 6:20 Afterward, when David went home to greet his family, Michal came out to meet him. "The king of Israel made a big name for himself today!" she said. "He exposed himself like a fool in the sight of the servant women of his officials!" 
102Sm 6:21 David answered, "I was dancing to honor the LORD, who chose me instead of your father and his family to make me the leader of his people Israel. And I will go on dancing to honor the LORD, 
102Sm 6:22 and will disgrace myself even more. You may think I am nothing, but those women will think highly of me!" 
102Sm 6:23 Michal, Saul's daughter, never had any children. 
102Sm 7:1 King David was settled in his palace, and the LORD kept him safe from all his enemies. 
102Sm 7:2 Then the king said to the prophet Nathan, "Here I am living in a house built of cedar, but God's Covenant Box is kept in a tent!" 
102Sm 7:3 Nathan answered, "Do whatever you have in mind, because the LORD is with you." 
102Sm 7:4 But that night the LORD said to Nathan, 
102Sm 7:5 "Go and tell my servant David that I say to him, 'You are not the one to build a temple for me to live in. 
102Sm 7:6 From the time I rescued the people of Israel from Egypt until now, I have never lived in a temple; I have traveled around living in a tent. 
102Sm 7:7 In all my traveling with the people of Israel I never asked any of the leaders that I appointed why they had not built me a temple made of cedar.' 
102Sm 7:8 "So tell my servant David that I, the LORD Almighty, say to him, 'I took you from looking after sheep in the fields and made you the ruler of my people Israel. 
102Sm 7:9 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have defeated all your enemies as you advanced. I will make you as famous as the greatest leaders in the world. 
102Sm 7:10 I have chosen a place for my people Israel and have settled them there, where they will live without being oppressed any more. 
102Sm 7:11 Ever since they entered this land, they have been attacked by violent people, but this will not happen again. I promise to keep you safe from all your enemies and to give you descendants. 
102Sm 7:12 When you die and are buried with your ancestors, I will make one of your sons king and will keep his kingdom strong. 
102Sm 7:13 He will be the one to build a temple for me, and I will make sure that his dynasty continues forever. 
102Sm 7:14 I will be his father, and he will be my son. When he does wrong, I will punish him as a father punishes his son. 
102Sm 7:15 But I will not withdraw my support from him as I did from Saul, whom I removed so that you could be king. 
102Sm 7:16 You will always have descendants, and I will make your kingdom last forever. Your dynasty will never end.' " 
102Sm 7:17 Nathan told David everything that God had revealed to him. 
102Sm 7:18 Then King David went into the Tent of the LORD's presence, sat down and prayed, "Sovereign LORD, I am not worthy of what you have already done for me, nor is my family. 
102Sm 7:19 Yet now you are doing even more, Sovereign LORD; you have made promises about my descendants in the years to come. And you let a man see this, Sovereign LORD! 
102Sm 7:20 What more can I say to you! You know me, your servant. 
102Sm 7:21 It was your will and purpose to do this; you have done all these great things in order to instruct me. 
102Sm 7:22 How great you are, Sovereign LORD! There is none like you; we have always known that you alone are God. 
102Sm 7:23 There is no other nation on earth like Israel, whom you rescued from slavery to make them your own people. The great and wonderful things you did for them have spread your fame throughout the world. You drove out other nations and their gods as your people advanced, the people whom you set free from Egypt to be your own. 
102Sm 7:24 You have made Israel your own people forever, and you, LORD, have become their God. 
102Sm 7:25 "And now, LORD God, fulfill for all time the promise you made about me and my descendants, and do what you said you would. 
102Sm 7:26 Your fame will be great, and people will forever say, 'The LORD Almighty is God over Israel.' And you will preserve my dynasty for all time. 
102Sm 7:27 LORD Almighty, God of Israel! I have the courage to pray this prayer to you, because you have revealed all this to me, your servant, and have told me that you will make my descendants kings. 
102Sm 7:28 "And now, Sovereign LORD, you are God; you always keep your promises, and you have made this wonderful promise to me. 
102Sm 7:29 I ask you to bless my descendants so that they will continue to enjoy your favor. You, Sovereign LORD, have promised this, and your blessing will rest on my descendants forever." 
102Sm 8:1 Some time later King David attacked the Philistines again, defeated them, and ended their control over the land. 
102Sm 8:2 Then he defeated the Moabites. He made the prisoners lie down on the ground and put two out of every three of them to death. So the Moabites became his subjects and paid taxes to him. 
102Sm 8:3 Then he defeated the king of the Syrian state of Zobah, Hadadezer son of Rehob, as Hadadezer was on his way to restore his control over the territory by the upper Euphrates River. 
102Sm 8:4 David captured seventeen hundred of his cavalry and twenty thousand of his foot soldiers. He kept enough horses for a hundred chariots and crippled all the rest. 
102Sm 8:5 When the Syrians of Damascus sent an army to help King Hadadezer, David attacked it and killed twenty-two thousand men. 
102Sm 8:6 Then he set up military camps in their territory, and they became his subjects and paid taxes to him. The LORD made David victorious everywhere. 
102Sm 8:7 David captured the gold shields carried by Hadadezer's officials and took them to Jerusalem. 
102Sm 8:8 He also took a great quantity of bronze from Betah and Berothai, cities ruled by Hadadezer. 
102Sm 8:9 King Toi of Hamath heard that David had defeated all of Hadadezer's army. 
102Sm 8:10 So he sent his son Joram to greet King David and congratulate him for his victory over Hadadezer, against whom Toi had fought many times. Joram took David presents made of gold, silver, and bronze. 
102Sm 8:11 King David dedicated them for use in worship, along with the silver and gold he took from the nations he had conquered - 
102Sm 8:12 Edom, Moab, Ammon, Philistia, and Amalek - as well as part of the loot he had taken from Hadadezer. 
102Sm 8:13 David became even more famous when he returned from killing eighteen thousand Edomites in Salt Valley. 
102Sm 8:14 He set up military camps throughout Edom, and the people there became his subjects. The LORD made David victorious everywhere. 
102Sm 8:15 David ruled over all of Israel and made sure that his people were always treated fairly and justly. 
102Sm 8:16 Joab, whose mother was Zeruiah, was the commander of the army; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was in charge of the records; 
102Sm 8:17 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were priests; Seraiah was the court secretary; 
102Sm 8:18 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in charge of David's bodyguards; and David's sons were priests. 
102Sm 9:1 One day David asked, "Is there anyone left of Saul's family? If there is, I would like to show him kindness for Jonathan's sake." 
102Sm 9:2 There was a servant of Saul's family named Ziba, and he was told to go to David. "Are you Ziba?" the king asked. "At your service, sir," he answered. 
102Sm 9:3 The king asked him, "Is there anyone left of Saul's family to whom I can show loyalty and kindness, as I promised God I would?" Ziba answered, "There is still one of Jonathan's sons. He is crippled." 
102Sm 9:4 "Where is he?" the king asked. "At the home of Machir son of Ammiel in Lodebar," Ziba answered. 
102Sm 9:5 So King David sent for him. 
102Sm 9:6 When Mephibosheth, the son of Jonathan and grandson of Saul, arrived, he bowed down before David in respect. David said, "Mephibosheth," and he answered, "At your service, sir." 
102Sm 9:7 "Don't be afraid," David replied. "I will be kind to you for the sake of your father Jonathan. I will give you back all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will always be welcome at my table." 
102Sm 9:8 Mephibosheth bowed again and said, "I am no better than a dead dog, sir! Why should you be so good to me?" 
102Sm 9:9 Then the king called Ziba, Saul's servant, and said, "I am giving Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, everything that belonged to Saul and his family. 
102Sm 9:10 You, your sons, and your servants will farm the land for your master Saul's family and bring in the harvest, to provide food for them. But Mephibosheth himself will always be a guest at my table." (Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.) 
102Sm 9:11 Ziba answered, "I will do everything Your Majesty commands." So Mephibosheth ate at the king's table, just like one of the king's sons. 
102Sm 9:12 Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. All the members of Ziba's family became servants of Mephibosheth. 
102Sm 9:13 So Mephibosheth, who was crippled in both feet, lived in Jerusalem, eating all his meals at the king's table. 
102Sm 10:1 Some time later King Nahash of Ammon died, and his son Hanun became king. 
102Sm 10:2 King David said, "I must show loyal friendship to Hanun, as his father Nahash did to me." So David sent messengers to express his sympathy. When they arrived in Ammon, 
102Sm 10:3 the Ammonite leaders said to the king, "Do you think that it is in your father's honor that David has sent these men to express sympathy to you? Of course not! He has sent them here as spies to explore the city, so that he can conquer us!" 
102Sm 10:4 Hanun seized David's messengers, shaved off one side of their beards, cut off their clothes at the hips, and sent them away. 
102Sm 10:5 They were too ashamed to return home. When David heard about what had happened, he sent word for them to stay in Jericho and not return until their beards had grown again. 
102Sm 10:6 The Ammonites realized that they had made David their enemy, so they hired twenty thousand Syrian soldiers from Bethrehob and Zobah, twelve thousand men from Tob, and the king of Maacah with a thousand men. 
102Sm 10:7 David heard of it and sent Joab against them with the whole army. 
102Sm 10:8 The Ammonites marched out and took up their position at the entrance to Rabbah, their capital city, while the others, both the Syrians and the men from Tob and Maacah, took up their position in the open countryside. 
102Sm 10:9 Joab saw that the enemy troops would attack him in front and from the rear, so he chose the best of Israel's soldiers and put them in position facing the Syrians. 
102Sm 10:10 He placed the rest of his troops under the command of his brother Abishai, who put them in position facing the Ammonites. 
102Sm 10:11 Joab said to him, "If you see that the Syrians are defeating me, come and help me, and if the Ammonites are defeating you, I will go and help you. 
102Sm 10:12 Be strong and courageous! Let's fight hard for our people and for the cities of our God. And may the LORD's will be done!" 
102Sm 10:13 Joab and his men advanced to attack, and the Syrians fled. 
102Sm 10:14 When the Ammonites saw the Syrians running away, they fled from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab turned back from fighting the Ammonites and went back to Jerusalem. 
102Sm 10:15 The Syrians realized that they had been defeated by the Israelites, and so they called all their troops together. 
102Sm 10:16 King Hadadezer sent for the Syrians who were on the east side of the Euphrates River, and they came to Helam under the command of Shobach, commander of the army of King Hadadezer of Zobah. 
102Sm 10:17 When David heard of it, he gathered the Israelite troops, crossed the Jordan River, and marched to Helam, where the Syrians took up their position facing him. The fighting began, 
102Sm 10:18 and the Israelites drove the Syrian army back. David and his men killed seven hundred Syrian chariot drivers and forty thousand cavalry, and they wounded Shobach, the enemy commander, who died on the battlefield. 
102Sm 10:19 When the kings who were subject to Hadadezer realized that they had been defeated by the Israelites, they made peace with them and became their subjects. And the Syrians were afraid to help the Ammonites any more. 
102Sm 11:1 The following spring, at the time of the year when kings usually go to war, David sent out Joab with his officers and the Israelite army; they defeated the Ammonites and besieged the city of Rabbah. But David himself stayed in Jerusalem. 
102Sm 11:2 One day, late in the afternoon, David got up from his nap and went to the palace roof. As he walked around up there, he saw a woman taking a bath in her house. She was very beautiful. 
102Sm 11:3 So he sent a messenger to find out who she was, and learned that she was Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite. 
102Sm 11:4 David sent messengers to get her; they brought her to him and he made love to her. (She had just finished her monthly ritual of purification.) Then she went back home. 
102Sm 11:5 Afterward she discovered that she was pregnant and sent a message to David to tell him. 
102Sm 11:6 David then sent a message to Joab: "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent him to David. 
102Sm 11:7 When Uriah arrived, David asked him if Joab and the troops were well, and how the fighting was going. 
102Sm 11:8 Then he said to Uriah, "Go on home and rest a while." Uriah left, and David had a present sent to his home. 
102Sm 11:9 But Uriah did not go home; instead he slept at the palace gate with the king's guards. 
102Sm 11:10 When David heard that Uriah had not gone home, he asked him, "You have just returned after a long absence; why didn't you go home?" 
102Sm 11:11 Uriah answered, "The men of Israel and Judah are away in battle, and the Covenant Box is with them; my commander Joab and his officers are camping out in the open. How could I go home, eat and drink, and sleep with my wife? By all that's sacred, I swear that I could never do such a thing!" 
102Sm 11:12 So David said, "Then stay here the rest of the day, and tomorrow I'll send you back." So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next. 
102Sm 11:13 David invited him to supper and got him drunk. But again that night Uriah did not go home; instead he slept on his blanket in the palace guardroom. 
102Sm 11:14 The next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it by Uriah. 
102Sm 11:15 He wrote: "Put Uriah in the front line, where the fighting is heaviest, then retreat and let him be killed." 
102Sm 11:16 So while Joab was besieging the city, he sent Uriah to a place where he knew the enemy was strong. 
102Sm 11:17 The enemy troops came out of the city and fought Joab's forces; some of David's officers were killed, and so was Uriah. 
102Sm 11:18 Then Joab sent a report to David telling him about the battle, 
102Sm 11:19 and he instructed the messenger, "After you have told the king all about the battle, 
102Sm 11:20 he may get angry and ask you, 'Why did you go so near the city to fight them? Didn't you realize that they would shoot arrows from the walls? 
102Sm 11:21 Don't you remember how Abimelech son of Gideon was killed? It was at Thebez, where a woman threw a millstone down from the wall and killed him. Why, then, did you go so near the wall?' If the king asks you this, tell him, 'Your officer Uriah was also killed.' " 
102Sm 11:22 So the messenger went to David and told him what Joab had commanded him to say. 
102Sm 11:23 He said, "Our enemies were stronger than we were and came out of the city to fight us in the open, but we drove them back to the city gate. 
102Sm 11:24 Then they shot arrows at us from the wall, and some of Your Majesty's officers were killed; your officer Uriah was also killed." 
102Sm 11:25 David said to the messenger, "Encourage Joab and tell him not to be upset, since you never can tell who will die in battle. Tell him to launch a stronger attack on the city and capture it." 
102Sm 11:26 When Bathsheba heard that her husband had been killed, she mourned for him. 
102Sm 11:27 When the time of mourning was over, David had her brought to the palace; she became his wife and bore him a son. But the LORD was not pleased with what David had done. 
102Sm 12:1 The LORD sent the prophet Nathan to David. Nathan went to him and said, "There were two men who lived in the same town; one was rich and the other poor. 
102Sm 12:2 The rich man had many cattle and sheep, 
102Sm 12:3 while the poor man had only one lamb, which he had bought. He took care of it, and it grew up in his home with his children. He would feed it some of his own food, let it drink from his cup, and hold it in his lap. The lamb was like a daughter to him. 
102Sm 12:4 One day a visitor arrived at the rich man's home. The rich man didn't want to kill one of his own animals to fix a meal for him; instead, he took the poor man's lamb and prepared a meal for his guest." 
102Sm 12:5 David became very angry at the rich man and said, "I swear by the living LORD that the man who did this ought to die! 
102Sm 12:6 For having done such a cruel thing, he must pay back four times as much as he took." 
102Sm 12:7 "You are that man," Nathan said to David. "And this is what the LORD God of Israel says: 'I made you king of Israel and rescued you from Saul. 
102Sm 12:8 I gave you his kingdom and his wives; I made you king over Israel and Judah. If this had not been enough, I would have given you twice as much. 
102Sm 12:9 Why, then, have you disobeyed my commands? Why did you do this evil thing? You had Uriah killed in battle; you let the Ammonites kill him, and then you took his wife! 
102Sm 12:10 Now, in every generation some of your descendants will die a violent death because you have disobeyed me and have taken Uriah's wife. 
102Sm 12:11 I swear to you that I will cause someone from your own family to bring trouble on you. You will see it when I take your wives from you and give them to another man; and he will have intercourse with them in broad daylight. 
102Sm 12:12 You sinned in secret, but I will make this happen in broad daylight for all Israel to see.' " 
102Sm 12:13 "I have sinned against the LORD," David said. Nathan replied, "The LORD forgives you; you will not die. 
102Sm 12:14 But because you have shown such contempt for the LORD in doing this, your child will die." 
102Sm 12:15 Then Nathan went home. The LORD caused the child that Uriah's wife had borne to David to become very sick. 
102Sm 12:16 David prayed to God that the child would get well. He refused to eat anything, and every night he went into his room and spent the night lying on the floor. 
102Sm 12:17 His court officials went to him and tried to make him get up, but he refused and would not eat anything with them. 
102Sm 12:18 A week later the child died, and David's officials were afraid to tell him the news. They said, "While the child was living, David wouldn't answer us when we spoke to him. How can we tell him that his child is dead? He might do himself some harm!" 
102Sm 12:19 When David noticed them whispering to each other, he realized that the child had died. So he asked them, "Is the child dead?" "Yes, he is," they answered. 
102Sm 12:20 David got up from the floor, took a bath, combed his hair, and changed his clothes. Then he went and worshiped in the house of the LORD. When he returned to the palace, he asked for food and ate it as soon as it was served. 
102Sm 12:21 "We don't understand this," his officials said to him. "While the child was alive, you wept for him and would not eat; but as soon as he died, you got up and ate!" 
102Sm 12:22 "Yes," David answered, "I did fast and weep while he was still alive. I thought that the LORD might be merciful to me and not let the child die. 
102Sm 12:23 But now that he is dead, why should I fast? Could I bring the child back to life? I will some day go to where he is, but he can never come back to me." 
102Sm 12:24 Then David comforted his wife Bathsheba. He had intercourse with her, and she bore a son, whom David named Solomon. The LORD loved the boy 
102Sm 12:25 and commanded the prophet Nathan to name the boy Jedidiah, because the LORD loved him. 
102Sm 12:26 Meanwhile Joab continued his campaign against Rabbah, the capital city of Ammon, and was about to capture it. 
102Sm 12:27 He sent messengers to David to report: "I have attacked Rabbah and have captured its water supply. 
102Sm 12:28 Now gather the rest of your forces, attack the city and take it yourself. I don't want to get the credit for capturing it." 
102Sm 12:29 So David gathered his forces, went to Rabbah, attacked it, and conquered it. 
102Sm 12:30 From the head of the idol of the Ammonite god Molech David took a gold crown which weighed about seventy-five pounds and had a jewel in it. David took the jewel and put it in his own crown. He also took a large amount of loot from the city 
102Sm 12:31 and put its people to work with saws, iron hoes, and iron axes, and forced them to work at making bricks. He did the same to the people of all the other towns of Ammon. Then he and his men returned to Jerusalem. 
102Sm 13:1 David's son Absalom had a beautiful unmarried sister named Tamar. Amnon, another of David's sons, fell in love with her. 
102Sm 13:2 He was so much in love with her that he became sick, because it seemed impossible for him to have her; as a virgin, she was kept from meeting men. 
102Sm 13:3 But he had a friend, a very shrewd man named Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shammah. 
102Sm 13:4 Jonadab said to Amnon, "You are the king's son, yet day after day I see you looking sad. What's the matter?" "I'm in love with Tamar, the sister of my half brother Absalom," he answered. 
102Sm 13:5 Jonadab said to him, "Pretend that you are sick and go to bed. When your father comes to see you, say to him, 'Please ask my sister Tamar to come and feed me. I want her to fix the food here where I can see her, and then serve it to me herself.' " 
102Sm 13:6 So Amnon pretended that he was sick and went to bed. King David went to see him, and Amnon said to him, "Please let Tamar come and make a few cakes here where I can see her, and then serve them to me herself." 
102Sm 13:7 So David sent word to Tamar in the palace: "Go to Amnon's house and fix him some food." 
102Sm 13:8 She went there and found him in bed. She took some dough, prepared it, and made some cakes there where he could see her. Then she baked the cakes 
102Sm 13:9 and emptied them out of the pan for him to eat, but he wouldn't. He said, "Send everyone away" - and they all left. 
102Sm 13:10 Then he said to her, "Bring the cakes here to my bed and serve them to me yourself." She took the cakes and went over to him. 
102Sm 13:11 As she offered them to him, he grabbed her and said, "Come to bed with me!" 
102Sm 13:12 "No," she said. "Don't force me to do such a degrading thing! That's awful! 
102Sm 13:13 How could I ever hold up my head in public again? And you - you would be completely disgraced in Israel. Please, speak to the king, and I'm sure that he will give me to you." 
102Sm 13:14 But he would not listen to her; and since he was stronger than she was, he overpowered her and raped her. 
102Sm 13:15 Then Amnon was filled with a deep hatred for her; he hated her now even more than he had loved her before. He said to her, "Get out!" 
102Sm 13:16 "No," she answered. "To send me away like this is a greater crime than what you just did!" But Amnon would not listen to her; 
102Sm 13:17 he called in his personal servant and said, "Get this woman out of my sight! Throw her out and lock the door!" 
102Sm 13:18 The servant put her out and locked the door. Tamar was wearing a long robe with full sleeves, the usual clothing for an unmarried princess in those days. 
102Sm 13:19 She sprinkled ashes on her head, tore her robe, and with her face buried in her hands went away crying. 
102Sm 13:20 When her brother Absalom saw her, he asked, "Has Amnon molested you? Please, sister, don't let it upset you so much. He is your half brother, so don't tell anyone about it." So Tamar lived in Absalom's house, sad and lonely. 
102Sm 13:21 When King David heard what had happened, he was furious. 
102Sm 13:22 And Absalom hated Amnon so much for having raped his sister Tamar that he would no longer even speak to him. 
102Sm 13:23 Two years later Absalom was having his sheep sheared at Baal Hazor, near the town of Ephraim, and he invited all the king's sons to be there. 
102Sm 13:24 He went to King David and said, "Your Majesty, I am having my sheep sheared. Will you and your officials come and take part in the festivities?" 
102Sm 13:25 "No, my son," the king answered. "It would be too much trouble for you if we all went." Absalom insisted, but the king would not give in, and he asked Absalom to leave. 
102Sm 13:26 But Absalom said, "Well, then, will you at least let my brother Amnon come?" "Why should he?" the king asked. 
102Sm 13:27 But Absalom kept on insisting until David finally let Amnon and all his other sons go with Absalom. Absalom prepared a banquet fit for a king 
102Sm 13:28 and instructed his servants: "Notice when Amnon has had too much to drink, and then when I give the order, kill him. Don't be afraid. I will take the responsibility myself. Be brave and don't hesitate!" 
102Sm 13:29 So the servants followed Absalom's instructions and killed Amnon. All the rest of David's sons mounted their mules and fled. 
102Sm 13:30 While they were on their way home, David was told: "Absalom has killed all your sons - not one of them is left!" 
102Sm 13:31 The king stood up, tore his clothes in sorrow, and threw himself to the ground. The servants who were there with him tore their clothes also. 
102Sm 13:32 But Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shammah, said, "Your Majesty, they haven't killed all your sons. Only Amnon is dead. You could tell by looking at Absalom that he had made up his mind to do this from the time that Amnon raped his sister Tamar. 
102Sm 13:33 So don't believe the news that all your sons are dead; only Amnon was killed." 
102Sm 13:34 In the meantime Absalom had fled. Just then the soldier on sentry duty saw a large crowd coming down the hill on the road from Horonaim. He went to the king and reported what he had seen. 
102Sm 13:35 Jonadab said to David, "Those are your sons coming, just as I said they would." 
102Sm 13:36 As soon as he finished saying this, David's sons came in; they started crying, and David and his officials also cried bitterly. 
102Sm 13:37 Absalom fled and went to the king of Geshur, Talmai son of Ammihud, and stayed there three years. 
102Sm 13:38 David mourned a long time for his son Amnon; 
102Sm 13:39 but when he got over Amnon's death, he was filled with longing for his son Absalom. 
102Sm 14:1 Joab knew that King David missed Absalom very much, 
102Sm 14:2 so he sent for a clever woman who lived in Tekoa. When she arrived, he said to her, "Pretend that you are in mourning; put on your mourning clothes, and don't comb your hair. Act like a woman who has been in mourning for a long time. 
102Sm 14:3 Then go to the king and say to him what I tell you to say." Then Joab told her what to say. 
102Sm 14:4 The woman went to the king, bowed down to the ground in respect, and said, "Help me, Your Majesty!" 
102Sm 14:5 "What do you want?" he asked her. "I am a poor widow, sir," she answered. "My husband is dead. 
102Sm 14:6 Sir, I had two sons, and one day they got into a quarrel out in the fields, where there was no one to separate them, and one of them killed the other. 
102Sm 14:7 And now, sir, all my relatives have turned against me and are demanding that I hand my son over to them, so that they can kill him for murdering his brother. If they do this, I will be left without a son. They will destroy my last hope and leave my husband without a son to keep his name alive." 
102Sm 14:8 "Go back home," the king answered, "and I will take care of the matter." 
102Sm 14:9 "Your Majesty," she said, "whatever you do, my family and I will take the blame; you and the royal family are innocent." 
102Sm 14:10 The king replied, "If anyone threatens you, bring him to me, and he will never bother you again." 
102Sm 14:11 She said, "Your Majesty, please pray to the LORD your God, so that my relative who is responsible for avenging the death of my son will not commit a greater crime by killing my other son." "I promise by the living LORD," David replied, "that your son will not be harmed in the least." 
102Sm 14:12 "Please, Your Majesty, let me say just one more thing," the woman said. "All right," he answered. 
102Sm 14:13 She said to him, "Why have you done such a wrong to God's people? You have not allowed your own son to return from exile, and so you have condemned yourself by what you have just said. 
102Sm 14:14 We will all die; we are like water spilled on the ground, which can't be gathered again. Even God does not bring the dead back to life, but the king can at least find a way to bring a man back from exile. 
102Sm 14:15 Now, Your Majesty, the reason I have come to speak to you is that the people threatened me, and so I said to myself that I would speak to you in the hope that you would do what I ask. 
102Sm 14:16 I thought you would listen to me and save me from the one who is trying to kill my son and me and so remove us from the land God gave his people. 
102Sm 14:17 I said to myself that your promise, sir, would make me safe, because the king is like God's angel and can distinguish good from evil. May the LORD your God be with you!" 
102Sm 14:18 The king answered, "I'm going to ask you a question, and you must tell me the whole truth." "Ask me anything, Your Majesty," she answered. 
102Sm 14:19 "Did Joab put you up to this?" he asked her. She answered, "I swear by all that is sacred, Your Majesty, that there is no way to avoid answering your question. It was indeed your officer Joab who told me what to do and what to say. 
102Sm 14:20 But he did it in order to straighten out this whole matter. Your Majesty is as wise as the angel of God and knows everything that happens." 
102Sm 14:21 Later on the king said to Joab, "I have decided to do what you want. Go and get the young man Absalom and bring him back here." 
102Sm 14:22 Joab threw himself to the ground in front of David in respect, and said, "God bless you, Your Majesty! Now I know that you are pleased with me, because you have granted my request." 
102Sm 14:23 Then he got up and went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem. 
102Sm 14:24 The king, however, gave orders that Absalom should not live in the palace. "I don't want to see him," the king said. So Absalom lived in his own house and did not appear before the king. 
102Sm 14:25 There was no one in Israel as famous for his good looks as Absalom; he had no defect from head to toe. 
102Sm 14:26 His hair was very thick, and he had to cut it once a year, when it grew too long and heavy. It would weigh about five pounds according to the royal standard of weights. 
102Sm 14:27 Absalom had three sons and one daughter named Tamar, a very beautiful woman. 
102Sm 14:28 Absalom lived two years in Jerusalem without seeing the king. 
102Sm 14:29 Then he sent for Joab, to ask him to go to the king for him; but Joab would not come. Again Absalom sent for him, and again Joab refused to come. 
102Sm 14:30 So Absalom said to his servants, "Look, Joab's field is next to mine, and it has barley growing in it. Go and set fire to it." So they went and set the field on fire. 
102Sm 14:31 Joab went to Absalom's house and demanded, "Why did your servants set fire to my field?" 
102Sm 14:32 Absalom answered, "Because you wouldn't come when I sent for you. I wanted you to go to the king and ask for me: 'Why did I leave Geshur and come here? It would have been better for me to have stayed there.' " And Absalom went on, "I want you to arrange for me to see the king, and if I'm guilty, then let him put me to death." 
102Sm 14:33 So Joab went to King David and told him what Absalom had said. The king sent for Absalom, who went to him and bowed down to the ground in front of him. The king welcomed him with a kiss. 
102Sm 15:1 After this, Absalom provided a chariot and horses for himself, and an escort of fifty men. 
102Sm 15:2 He would get up early and go and stand by the road at the city gate. Whenever someone came there with a dispute that he wanted the king to settle, Absalom would call him over and ask him where he was from. And after the man had told him what tribe he was from, 
102Sm 15:3 Absalom would say, "Look, the law is on your side, but there is no representative of the king to hear your case." 
102Sm 15:4 And he would add, "How I wish I were a judge! Then anyone who had a dispute or a claim could come to me, and I would give him justice." 
102Sm 15:5 When the man would approach Absalom to bow down before him, Absalom would reach out, take hold of him, and kiss him. 
102Sm 15:6 Absalom did this with every Israelite who came to the king for judgment, and so he won their loyalty. 
102Sm 15:7 After four years Absalom said to King David, "Sir, let me go to Hebron and keep a promise I made to the LORD. 
102Sm 15:8 While I was living in Geshur in Syria, I promised the LORD that if he would take me back to Jerusalem, I would worship him in Hebron." 
102Sm 15:9 "Go in peace," the king said. So Absalom went to Hebron. 
102Sm 15:10 But he sent messengers to all the tribes of Israel to say, "When you hear the sound of trumpets, shout, 'Absalom has become king at Hebron!' " 
102Sm 15:11 There were two hundred men who at Absalom's invitation had gone from Jerusalem with him; they knew nothing of the plot and went in all good faith. 
102Sm 15:12 And while he was offering sacrifices, Absalom also sent to the town of Gilo for Ahithophel, who was one of King David's advisers. The plot against the king gained strength, and Absalom's followers grew in number. 
102Sm 15:13 A messenger reported to David, "The Israelites are pledging their loyalty to Absalom." 
102Sm 15:14 So David said to all his officials who were with him in Jerusalem, "We must get away at once if we want to escape from Absalom! Hurry! Or else he will soon be here and defeat us and kill everyone in the city!" 
102Sm 15:15 "Yes, Your Majesty," they answered. "We are ready to do whatever you say." 
102Sm 15:16 So the king left, accompanied by all his family and officials, except for ten concubines, whom he left behind to take care of the palace. 
102Sm 15:17 As the king and all his men were leaving the city, they stopped at the last house. 
102Sm 15:18 All his officials stood next to him as the royal bodyguards passed by in front of him. The six hundred soldiers who had followed him from Gath also passed by, 
102Sm 15:19 and the king said to Ittai, their leader, "Why are you going with us? Go back and stay with the new king. You are a foreigner, a refugee away from your own country. 
102Sm 15:20 You have lived here only a short time, so why should I make you wander around with me? I don't even know where I'm going. Go back and take all your people with you - and may the LORD be kind and faithful to you." 
102Sm 15:21 But Ittai answered, "Your Majesty, I swear to you in the LORD's name that I will always go with you wherever you go, even if it means death." 
102Sm 15:22 "Fine!" David answered. "March on!" So Ittai went on with all his men and their dependents. 
102Sm 15:23 The people cried loudly as David's followers left. The king crossed Kidron Brook, followed by his men, and together they went out toward the wilderness. 
102Sm 15:24 Zadok the priest was there, and with him were the Levites, carrying the sacred Covenant Box. They set it down and didn't pick it up again until all the people had left the city. The priest Abiathar was there too. 
102Sm 15:25 Then the king said to Zadok, "Take the Covenant Box back to the city. If the LORD is pleased with me, some day he will let me come back to see it and the place where it stays. 
102Sm 15:26 But if he isn't pleased with me - well, then, let him do to me what he wishes." 
102Sm 15:27 And he went on to say to Zadok, "Look, take your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan and go back to the city in peace. 
102Sm 15:28 Meanwhile, I will wait at the river crossings in the wilderness until I receive news from you." 
102Sm 15:29 So Zadok and Abiathar took the Covenant Box back into Jerusalem and stayed there. 
102Sm 15:30 David went on up the Mount of Olives crying; he was barefoot and had his head covered as a sign of grief. All who followed him covered their heads and cried also. 
102Sm 15:31 When David was told that Ahithophel had joined Absalom's rebellion, he prayed, "Please, LORD, turn Ahithophel's advice into nonsense!" 
102Sm 15:32 When David reached the top of the hill, where there was a place of worship, his trusted friend Hushai the Archite met him with his clothes torn and with dirt on his head. 
102Sm 15:33 David said to him, "You will be of no help to me if you come with me, 
102Sm 15:34 but you can help me by returning to the city and telling Absalom that you will now serve him as faithfully as you served his father. And do all you can to oppose any advice that Ahithophel gives. 
102Sm 15:35 The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be there; tell them everything you hear in the king's palace. 
102Sm 15:36 They have their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan with them, and you can send them to me with all the information you gather." 
102Sm 15:37 So Hushai, David's friend, returned to the city just as Absalom was arriving. 
102Sm 16:1 When David had gone a little beyond the top of the hill, he was suddenly met by Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, who had with him a couple of donkeys loaded with two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred bunches of raisins, a hundred bunches of fresh fruit, and a leather bag full of wine. 
102Sm 16:2 King David asked him, "What are you going to do with all that?" Ziba answered, "The donkeys are for Your Majesty's family to ride, the bread and the fruit are for the men to eat, and the wine is for them to drink when they get tired in the wilderness." 
102Sm 16:3 "Where is Mephibosheth, the grandson of your master Saul?" the king asked him. "He is staying in Jerusalem," Ziba answered, "because he is convinced that the Israelites will now restore to him the kingdom of his grandfather Saul." 
102Sm 16:4 The king said to Ziba, "Everything that belonged to Mephibosheth is yours." "I am your servant," Ziba replied. "May I always please Your Majesty!" 
102Sm 16:5 When King David arrived at Bahurim, one of Saul's relatives, Shimei son of Gera, came out to meet him, cursing him as he came. 
102Sm 16:6 Shimei started throwing stones at David and his officials, even though David was surrounded by his men and his bodyguards. 
102Sm 16:7 Shimei cursed him and said, "Get out! Get out! Murderer! Criminal! 
102Sm 16:8 You took Saul's kingdom, and now the LORD is punishing you for murdering so many of Saul's family. The LORD has given the kingdom to your son Absalom, and you are ruined, you murderer!" 
102Sm 16:9 Abishai, whose mother was Zeruiah, said to the king, "Your Majesty, why do you let this dog curse you? Let me go over there and cut off his head!" 
102Sm 16:10 "This is none of your business," the king said to Abishai and his brother Joab. "If he curses me because the LORD told him to, who has the right to ask why he does it?" 
102Sm 16:11 And David said to Abishai and to all his officials, "My own son is trying to kill me; so why should you be surprised at this Benjaminite? The LORD told him to curse; so leave him alone and let him do it. 
102Sm 16:12 Perhaps the LORD will notice my misery and give me some blessings to take the place of his curse." 
102Sm 16:13 So David and his men continued along the road. Shimei kept up with them, walking on the hillside; he was cursing and throwing stones and dirt at them as he went. 
102Sm 16:14 The king and all his men were worn out when they reached the Jordan, and there they rested. 
102Sm 16:15 Absalom and all the Israelites with him entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel was with them. 
102Sm 16:16 When Hushai, David's trusted friend, met Absalom, he shouted, "Long live the king! Long live the king!" 
102Sm 16:17 "What has happened to your loyalty to your friend David?" Absalom asked him. "Why didn't you go with him?" 
102Sm 16:18 Hushai answered, "How could I? I am for the one chosen by the LORD, by these people, and by all the Israelites. I will stay with you. 
102Sm 16:19 After all, whom should I serve, if not my master's son? As I served your father, so now I will serve you." 
102Sm 16:20 Then Absalom turned to Ahithophel and said, "Now that we are here, what do you advise us to do?" 
102Sm 16:21 Ahithophel answered, "Go and have intercourse with your father's concubines whom he left behind to take care of the palace. Then everyone in Israel will know that your father regards you as his enemy, and your followers will be greatly encouraged." 
102Sm 16:22 So they set up a tent for Absalom on the palace roof, and in the sight of everyone Absalom went in and had intercourse with his father's concubines. 
102Sm 16:23 Any advice that Ahithophel gave in those days was accepted as though it were the very word of God; both David and Absalom followed it. 
102Sm 17:1 Not long after that, Ahithophel said to Absalom, "Let me choose twelve thousand men, and tonight I will set out after David. 
102Sm 17:2 I will attack him while he is tired and discouraged. He will be frightened, and all his men will run away. I will kill only the king 
102Sm 17:3 and then bring back all his men to you, like a bride returning to her husband. You want to kill only one man; the rest of the people will be safe." 
102Sm 17:4 This seemed like good advice to Absalom and all the Israelite leaders. 
102Sm 17:5 Absalom said, "Now call Hushai, and let us hear what he has to say." 
102Sm 17:6 When Hushai arrived, Absalom said to him, "This is the advice that Ahithophel has given us; shall we follow it? If not, you tell us what to do." 
102Sm 17:7 Hushai answered, "The advice Ahithophel gave you this time is no good. 
102Sm 17:8 You know that your father David and his men are hard fighters and that they are as fierce as a mother bear robbed of her cubs. Your father is an experienced soldier and does not stay with his men at night. 
102Sm 17:9 Right now he is probably hiding in a cave or some other place. As soon as David attacks your men, whoever hears about it will say that your men have been defeated. 
102Sm 17:10 Then even the bravest men, as fearless as lions, will be afraid because everyone in Israel knows that your father is a great soldier and that his men are hard fighters. 
102Sm 17:11 My advice is that you bring all the Israelites together from one end of the country to the other, as many as the grains of sand on the seashore, and that you lead them personally in battle. 
102Sm 17:12 We will find David wherever he is, and attack him before he knows what's happening. Neither he nor any of his men will survive. 
102Sm 17:13 If he retreats into a city, our people will all bring ropes and just pull the city into the valley below. Not a single stone will be left there on top of the hill." 
102Sm 17:14 Absalom and all the Israelites said, "Hushai's advice is better than Ahithophel's." The LORD had decided that Ahithophel's good advice would not be followed, so that disaster would come on Absalom. 
102Sm 17:15 Then Hushai told the priests Zadok and Abiathar what advice he had given to Absalom and the Israelite leaders and what advice Ahithophel had given. 
102Sm 17:16 Hushai added, "Quick, now! Send a message to David not to spend the night at the river crossings in the wilderness, but to cross the Jordan at once, so that he and his men won't all be caught and killed." 
102Sm 17:17 Abiathar's son Jonathan and Zadok's son Ahimaaz were waiting at the spring of Enrogel, on the outskirts of Jerusalem, because they did not dare be seen entering the city. A servant woman would regularly go and tell them what was happening, and then they would go and tell King David. 
102Sm 17:18 But one day a boy happened to see them, and he told Absalom; so they hurried off to hide in the house of a certain man in Bahurim. He had a well near his house, and they got down in it. 
102Sm 17:19 The man's wife took a covering, spread it over the opening of the well and scattered grain over it, so that no one would notice anything. 
102Sm 17:20 Absalom's officials came to the house and asked the woman, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" "They crossed the river," she answered. The men looked for them but could not find them, and so they returned to Jerusalem. 
102Sm 17:21 After they left, Ahimaaz and Jonathan came up out of the well and went and reported to King David. They told him what Ahithophel had planned against him and said, "Hurry up and cross the river." 
102Sm 17:22 So David and his men started crossing the Jordan, and by daybreak they had all gone across. 
102Sm 17:23 When Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and went back to his hometown. After putting his affairs in order, he hanged himself. He was buried in the family grave. 
102Sm 17:24 David had reached the town of Mahanaim by the time Absalom and the Israelites had crossed the Jordan. 
102Sm 17:25 (Absalom had put Amasa in command of the army in the place of Joab. Amasa was the son of Jether the Ishmaelite; his mother was Abigail, the daughter of Nahash and the sister of Joab's mother Zeruiah.) 
102Sm 17:26 Absalom and his men camped in the land of Gilead. 
102Sm 17:27 When David arrived at Mahanaim, he was met by Shobi son of Nahash, from the city of Rabbah in Ammon, and by Machir son of Ammiel, from Lodebar, and by Barzillai, from Rogelim in Gilead. 
102Sm 17:28 They brought bowls, clay pots, and bedding, and also food for David and his men: wheat, barley, meal, roasted grain, beans, peas, honey, cheese, cream, and some sheep.
102Sm 17:29 They knew that David and his men would get hungry, thirsty, and tired in the wilderness. 
102Sm 18:1 King David brought all his men together, divided them into units of a thousand and of a hundred, and placed officers in command of them. 
102Sm 18:2 Then he sent them out in three groups, with Joab and Joab's brother Abishai and Ittai from Gath, each in command of a group. And the king said to his men, "I will go with you myself." 
102Sm 18:3 "You mustn't go with us," they answered. "It won't make any difference to the enemy if the rest of us turn and run, or even if half of us are killed; but you are worth ten thousand of us. It will be better if you stay here in the city and send us help." 
102Sm 18:4 "I will do whatever you think best," the king answered. Then he stood by the side of the gate as his men marched out in units of a thousand and of a hundred. 
102Sm 18:5 He gave orders to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai: "For my sake don't harm the young man Absalom." And all the troops heard David give this command to his officers. 
102Sm 18:6 David's army went out into the countryside and fought the Israelites in Ephraim Forest. 
102Sm 18:7 The Israelites were defeated by David's men; it was a terrible defeat, with twenty thousand men killed that day. 
102Sm 18:8 The fighting spread over the countryside, and more men died in the forest than were killed in battle. 
102Sm 18:9 Suddenly Absalom met some of David's men. Absalom was riding a mule, and as it went under a large oak tree, Absalom's head got caught in the branches. The mule ran on and Absalom was left hanging in midair. 
102Sm 18:10 One of David's men saw him and reported to Joab, "Sir, I saw Absalom hanging in an oak tree!" 
102Sm 18:11 Joab answered, "If you saw him, why didn't you kill him on the spot? I myself would have given you ten pieces of silver and a belt." 
102Sm 18:12 But the man answered, "Even if you gave me a thousand pieces of silver, I wouldn't lift a finger against the king's son. We all heard the king command you and Abishai and Ittai, 'For my sake don't harm the young man Absalom.' 
102Sm 18:13 But if I had disobeyed the king and killed Absalom, the king would have heard about it - he hears about everything - and you would not have defended me." 
102Sm 18:14 "I'm not going to waste any more time with you," Joab said. He took three spears and plunged them into Absalom's chest while he was still alive, hanging in the oak tree. 
102Sm 18:15 Then ten of Joab's soldiers closed in on Absalom and finished killing him. 
102Sm 18:16 Joab had the trumpet blown to stop the fighting, and his troops came back from pursuing the Israelites. 
102Sm 18:17 They took Absalom's body, threw it into a deep pit in the forest, and covered it with a huge pile of stones. All the Israelites fled to their own hometowns. 
102Sm 18:18 During his lifetime Absalom had built a monument for himself in King's Valley, because he had no son to keep his name alive. So he named it after himself, and to this day it is known as Absalom's Monument. 
102Sm 18:19 Then Ahimaaz son of Zadok said to Joab, "Let me run to the king with the good news that the LORD has saved him from his enemies." 
102Sm 18:20 "No," Joab said, "today you will not take any good news. Some other day you may do so, but not today, for the king's son is dead." 
102Sm 18:21 Then he said to his Ethiopian slave, "Go and tell the king what you have seen." The slave bowed and ran off. 
102Sm 18:22 Ahimaaz insisted, "I don't care what happens; please let me take the news also." "Why do you want to do it, my son?" Joab asked. "You will get no reward for it." 
102Sm 18:23 "Whatever happens," Ahimaaz said again, "I want to go." "Then go," Joab said. So Ahimaaz ran off down the road through the Jordan Valley, and soon he passed the slave. 
102Sm 18:24 David was sitting in the space between the inner and outer gates of the city. The lookout went up to the top of the wall and stood on the roof of the gateway; he looked out and saw a man running alone. 
102Sm 18:25 He called down and told the king, and the king said, "If he is alone, he is bringing good news." The runner kept coming closer. 
102Sm 18:26 Then the lookout saw another man running alone, and he called down to the gatekeeper, "Look! There's another man running!" The king answered, "This one also is bringing good news." 
102Sm 18:27 The lookout said, "I can see that the first man runs like Ahimaaz." "He's a good man," the king said, "and he is bringing good news." 
102Sm 18:28 Ahimaaz called out a greeting to the king, threw himself down to the ground before him, and said, "Praise the LORD your God, who has given you victory over the men who rebelled against Your Majesty!" 
102Sm 18:29 "Is the young man Absalom all right?" the king asked. Ahimaaz answered, "Sir, when your officer Joab sent me, I saw a great commotion, but I couldn't tell what it was." 
102Sm 18:30 "Stand over there," the king told him; and he went over and stood there. 
102Sm 18:31 Then the Ethiopian slave arrived and said to the king, "I have good news for Your Majesty! Today the LORD has given you victory over all who rebelled against you!" 
102Sm 18:32 "Is the young man Absalom all right?" the king asked. The slave answered, "I wish that what has happened to him would happen to all your enemies, sir, and to all who rebel against you." 
102Sm 18:33 The king was overcome with grief. He went up to the room over the gateway and wept. As he went, he cried, "O my son! My son Absalom! Absalom, my son! If only I had died in your place, my son! Absalom, my son!" 
102Sm 19:1 Joab was told that King David was weeping and mourning for Absalom. 
102Sm 19:2 And so the joy of victory was turned into sadness for all of David's troops that day, because they heard that the king was mourning for his son. 
102Sm 19:3 They went back into the city quietly, like soldiers who are ashamed because they are running away from battle. 
102Sm 19:4 The king covered his face and cried loudly, "O my son! My son Absalom! Absalom, my son!" 
102Sm 19:5 Joab went to the king's house and said to him, "Today you have humiliated your men - the men who saved your life and the lives of your sons and daughters and of your wives and concubines. 
102Sm 19:6 You oppose those who love you and support those who hate you! You have made it clear that your officers and men mean nothing to you. I can see that you would be quite happy if Absalom were alive today and all of us were dead. 
102Sm 19:7 Now go and reassure your men. I swear by the LORD's name that if you don't, not one of them will be with you by tomorrow morning. That would be the worst disaster you have suffered in all your life." 
102Sm 19:8 Then the king got up, and went and sat near the city gate. His men heard that he was there, and they all gathered around him. Meanwhile all the Israelites had fled to their own hometowns. 
102Sm 19:9 All over the country they started quarreling among themselves. "King David saved us from our enemies," they said to one another. "He rescued us from the Philistines, but now he has fled from Absalom and left the country. 
102Sm 19:10 We anointed Absalom as our king, but he has been killed in battle. So why doesn't somebody try to bring King David back?" 
102Sm 19:11 The news of what the Israelites were saying reached King David. So he sent the priests Zadok and Abiathar to ask the leaders of Judah, "Why should you be the last to help bring the king back to his palace? 
102Sm 19:12 You are my relatives, my own flesh and blood; why should you be the last to bring me back?" 
102Sm 19:13 David also told them to say to Amasa, "You are my relative. From now on I am putting you in charge of the army in place of Joab. May God strike me dead if I don't!" 
102Sm 19:14 David's words won the complete loyalty of all the men of Judah, and they sent him word to return with all his officials. 
102Sm 19:15 On his way back the king was met at the Jordan River by the men of Judah, who had come to Gilgal to escort him across the river. 
102Sm 19:16 At the same time the Benjaminite Shimei son of Gera from Bahurim hurried to the Jordan to meet King David. 
102Sm 19:17 He had with him a thousand men from the tribe of Benjamin. And Ziba, the servant of Saul's family, also came with his fifteen sons and twenty servants, and they arrived at the Jordan before the king. 
102Sm 19:18 They crossed the river to escort the royal party across and to do whatever the king wanted. As the king was getting ready to cross, Shimei threw himself down in front of him 
102Sm 19:19 and said, "Your Majesty, please forget the wrong I did that day you left Jerusalem. Don't hold it against me or think about it any more. 
102Sm 19:20 I know, sir, that I have sinned, and this is why I am the first one from the northern tribes to come and meet Your Majesty today." 
102Sm 19:21 Abishai son of Zeruiah spoke up: "Shimei should be put to death because he cursed the one whom the LORD chose as king." 
102Sm 19:22 But David said to Abishai and his brother Joab, "Who asked your opinion? Are you going to give me trouble? I am the one who is king of Israel now, and no Israelite will be put to death today." 
102Sm 19:23 And he said to Shimei, "I give you my word that you will not be put to death." 
102Sm 19:24 Then Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson, came down to meet the king. He had not washed his feet, trimmed his beard, or washed his clothes from the time the king left Jerusalem until he returned victorious. 
102Sm 19:25 When Mephibosheth arrived from Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, "Mephibosheth, you didn't go with me. Why not?" 
102Sm 19:26 He answered, "As you know, Your Majesty, I am crippled. I told my servant to saddle my donkey so that I could ride along with you, but he betrayed me. 
102Sm 19:27 He lied about me to Your Majesty, but you are like God's angel, so do what seems right to you. 
102Sm 19:28 All of my father's family deserved to be put to death by Your Majesty, but you gave me the right to eat at your table. I have no right to ask for any more favors from Your Majesty." 
102Sm 19:29 The king answered, "You don't have to say anything more. I have decided that you and Ziba will share Saul's property." 
102Sm 19:30 "Let Ziba have it all," Mephibosheth answered. "It's enough for me that Your Majesty has come home safely." 
102Sm 19:31 Barzillai, from Gilead, had also come down from Rogelim to escort the king across the Jordan. 
102Sm 19:32 Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years old. He was very rich and had supplied the king with food while he was staying at Mahanaim. 
102Sm 19:33 The king said to him, "Come with me to Jerusalem, and I will take care of you." 
102Sm 19:34 But Barzillai answered, "I don't have long to live; why should I go with Your Majesty to Jerusalem? 
102Sm 19:35 I am already eighty years old, and nothing gives me pleasure any more. I can't taste what I eat and drink, and I can't hear the voices of singers. I would only be a burden to Your Majesty. 
102Sm 19:36 I don't deserve such a great reward. So I will go just a little way with you beyond the Jordan. 
102Sm 19:37 Then let me go back home and die near my parents' grave. Here is my son Chimham, who will serve you; take him with you, Your Majesty, and do for him as you think best." 
102Sm 19:38 The king answered, "I will take him with me and do for him whatever you want. And I will do for you anything you ask." 
102Sm 19:39 Then David and all of his men crossed the Jordan. He kissed Barzillai and gave him his blessing, and Barzillai went back home. 
102Sm 19:40 When the king had crossed, escorted by all the people of Judah and half the people of Israel, he went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went with him. 
102Sm 19:41 Then all the Israelites went to the king and said to him, "Your Majesty, why did our brothers, the men of Judah, think they had the right to take you away and escort you, your family, and your men across the Jordan?" 
102Sm 19:42 The men of Judah answered, "We did it because the king is one of us. So why should this make you angry? He hasn't paid for our food nor has he given us anything." 
102Sm 19:43 The Israelites replied, "We have ten times as many claims on King David as you have, even if he is one of you. Why do you look down on us? Don't forget that we were the first to talk about bringing the king back!" But the men of Judah were more violent in making their claims than the men of Israel. 
102Sm 20:1 There happened to be in Gilgal a worthless character named Sheba son of Bikri, of the tribe of Benjamin. He blew the trumpet and called out, "Down with David! We won't follow him! Men of Israel, let's go home!" 
102Sm 20:2 So the Israelites deserted David and went with Sheba, but the men of Judah remained loyal and followed David from the Jordan to Jerusalem. 
102Sm 20:3 When David arrived at his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to take care of the palace, and put them under guard. He provided for their needs, but did not have intercourse with them. They were kept confined for the rest of their lives, living like widows. 
102Sm 20:4 The king said to Amasa, "Call the men of Judah together and be back here with them by the day after tomorrow." 
102Sm 20:5 Amasa went to call them, but he did not get back by the time the king had told him to. 
102Sm 20:6 So the king said to Abishai, "Sheba will give us more trouble than Absalom. Take my men and go after him, or else he may occupy some fortified towns and escape from us." 
102Sm 20:7 So Joab's men, the royal bodyguards, and all the other soldiers left Jerusalem with Abishai to go after Sheba. 
102Sm 20:8 When they reached the large rock at Gibeon, Amasa met them. Joab was dressed for battle, with a sword in its sheath fastened to his belt. As he came forward, the sword fell out. 
102Sm 20:9 Joab said to Amasa, "How are you, my friend?" and took hold of his beard with his right hand in order to kiss him. 
102Sm 20:10 Amasa was not on guard against the sword that Joab was holding in his other hand, and Joab stabbed him in the belly, and his insides spilled out on the ground. He died immediately, and Joab did not have to strike again. Then Joab and his brother Abishai went on after Sheba. 
102Sm 20:11 One of Joab's men stood by Amasa's body and called out, "Everyone who is for Joab and David follow Joab!" 
102Sm 20:12 Amasa's body, covered with blood, was lying in the middle of the road. Joab's man saw that everybody was stopping, so he dragged the body from the road out into the field and threw a blanket over it. 
102Sm 20:13 After the body had been removed from the road, everyone followed Joab in pursuit of Sheba. 
102Sm 20:14 Sheba passed through the territory of all the tribes of Israel and came to the city of Abel Beth Maacah, and all the members of the clan of Bikri assembled and followed him into the city. 
102Sm 20:15 Joab's men heard that Sheba was there, and so they went and besieged the city. They built ramps of earth against the outer wall and also began to dig under the wall to make it fall down. 
102Sm 20:16 There was a wise woman in the city who shouted from the wall, "Listen! Listen! Tell Joab to come here; I want to speak with him." 
102Sm 20:17 Joab went, and she asked, "Are you Joab?" "Yes, I am," he answered. "Listen to me, sir," she said. "I'm listening," he answered. 
102Sm 20:18 She said, "Long ago they used to say, 'Go and get your answer in the city of Abel' - and that's just what they did. 
102Sm 20:19 Ours is a great city, one of the most peaceful and loyal in Israel. Why are you trying to destroy it? Do you want to ruin what belongs to the LORD?" 
102Sm 20:20 "Never!" Joab answered. "I will never ruin or destroy your city! 
102Sm 20:21 That is not our plan. A man named Sheba son of Bikri, who is from the hill country of Ephraim, started a rebellion against King David. Hand over this one man, and I will withdraw from the city." "We will throw his head over the wall to you," she said. 
102Sm 20:22 Then she went to the people of the city with her plan, and they cut off Sheba's head and threw it over the wall to Joab. He blew the trumpet as a signal for his men to leave the city, and they went back home. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to the king. 
102Sm 20:23 Joab was in command of the army of Israel; Benaiah son of Jehoiada was in charge of David's bodyguards; 
102Sm 20:24 Adoniram was in charge of the forced labor; Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was in charge of the records; 
102Sm 20:25 Sheva was the court secretary; Zadok and Abiathar were the priests, 
102Sm 20:26 and Ira from the town of Jair was also one of David's priests. 
102Sm 21:1 During David's reign there was a severe famine which lasted for three full years. So David consulted the LORD about it, and the LORD said, "Saul and his family are guilty of murder; he put the people of Gibeon to death." 
102Sm 21:2 (The people of Gibeon were not Israelites; they were a small group of Amorites whom the Israelites had promised to protect, but Saul had tried to destroy them because of his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.) 
102Sm 21:3 So David summoned the people of Gibeon and said to them, "What can I do for you? I want to make up for the wrong that was done to you, so that you will bless the LORD's people." 
102Sm 21:4 They answered, "Our quarrel with Saul and his family can't be settled with silver or gold, nor do we want to kill any Israelite." "What, then, do you think I should do for you?" David asked. 
102Sm 21:5 They answered, "Saul wanted to destroy us and leave none of us alive anywhere in Israel. 
102Sm 21:6 So hand over seven of his male descendants, and we will hang them before the LORD at Gibeah, the hometown of Saul, the LORD's chosen king." "I will hand them over," the king answered. 
102Sm 21:7 But because of the sacred promise that he and Jonathan had made to each other, David spared Jonathan's son Mephibosheth, the grandson of Saul. 
102Sm 21:8 However, he took Armoni and Mephibosheth, the two sons that Rizpah the daughter of Aiah had borne to Saul; he also took the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whom she had borne to Adriel son of Barzillai, who was from Meholah. 
102Sm 21:9 David handed them over to the people of Gibeon, who hanged them on the mountain before the LORD - and all seven of them died together. It was late in the spring, at the beginning of the barley harvest, when they were put to death. 
102Sm 21:10 Then Saul's concubine Rizpah, the daughter of Aiah, used sackcloth to make a shelter for herself on the rock where the corpses were, and she stayed there from the beginning of harvest until the autumn rains came. During the day she would keep the birds away from the corpses, and at night she would protect them from wild animals. 
102Sm 21:11 When David heard what Rizpah had done, 
102Sm 21:12 he went and got the bones of Saul and of his son Jonathan from the people of Jabesh in Gilead. (They had stolen them from the public square in Beth Shan, where the Philistines had hanged the bodies on the day they killed Saul on Mount Gilboa.) 
102Sm 21:13 David took the bones of Saul and Jonathan and also gathered up the bones of the seven men who had been hanged. 
102Sm 21:14 Then they buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan in the grave of Saul's father Kish, in Zela in the territory of Benjamin, doing all that the king had commanded. And after that, God answered their prayers for the country. 
102Sm 21:15 There was another war between the Philistines and Israel, and David and his men went and fought the Philistines. During one of the battles David grew tired. 
102Sm 21:16 A giant named Ishbibenob, who was carrying a bronze spear that weighed about seven and a half pounds and who was wearing a new sword, thought he could kill David. 
102Sm 21:17 But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David's help, attacked the giant, and killed him. Then David's men made David promise that he would never again go out with them to battle. "You are the hope of Israel, and we don't want to lose you," they said. 
102Sm 21:18 After this there was a battle with the Philistines at Gob, during which Sibbecai from Hushah killed a giant named Saph. 
102Sm 21:19 There was another battle with the Philistines at Gob, and Elhanan son of Jair from Bethlehem killed Goliath from Gath, whose spear had a shaft as thick as the bar on a weaver's loom. 
102Sm 21:20 Then there was another battle at Gath, where there was a giant who loved to fight. He had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot. 
102Sm 21:21 He defied the Israelites, and Jonathan, the son of David's brother Shammah, killed him. 
102Sm 21:22 These four were descendants of the giants of Gath, and they were killed by David and his men. 
102Sm 22:1 When the LORD saved David from Saul and his other enemies, David sang this song to the LORD�� 102Sm 22:2 The LORD is my protector; he is my strong fortress. 
102Sm 22:3 My God is my protection, and with him I am safe. He protects me like a shield; he defends me and keeps me safe. He is my savior; he protects me and saves me from violence. 
102Sm 22:4 I call to the LORD, and he saves me from my enemies. Praise the LORD! 
102Sm 22:5 The waves of death were all around me; the waves of destruction rolled over me. 
102Sm 22:6 The danger of death was around me, and the grave set its trap for me. 
102Sm 22:7 In my trouble I called to the LORD; I called to my God for help. In his temple he heard my voice; he listened to my cry for help. 
102Sm 22:8 Then the earth trembled and shook; the foundations of the sky rocked and quivered because God was angry! 
102Sm 22:9 Smoke poured out of his nostrils, a consuming flame and burning coals from his mouth. 
102Sm 22:10 He tore the sky open and came down, with a dark cloud under his feet. 
102Sm 22:11 He flew swiftly on his winged creature; he traveled on the wings of the wind. 
102Sm 22:12 He covered himself with darkness; thick clouds, full of water, surrounded him; 
102Sm 22:13 burning coals flamed up from the lightning before him. 
102Sm 22:14 Then the LORD thundered from the sky, and the voice of Almighty God was heard. 
102Sm 22:15 He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies; with flashes of lightning he sent them running. 
102Sm 22:16 The floor of the ocean was laid bare, and the foundations of the earth were uncovered when the LORD rebuked his enemies and roared at them in anger. 
102Sm 22:17 The LORD reached down from above and took hold of me; he pulled me out of the deep waters. 
102Sm 22:18 He rescued me from my powerful enemies and from all those who hate me - they were too strong for me. 
102Sm 22:19 When I was in trouble, they attacked me, but the LORD protected me. 
102Sm 22:20 He helped me out of danger; he saved me because he was pleased with me. 
102Sm 22:21 The LORD rewards me because I do what is right; he blesses me because I am innocent. 
102Sm 22:22 I have obeyed the law of the LORD; I have not turned away from my God. 
102Sm 22:23 I have observed all his laws; I have not disobeyed his commands. 
102Sm 22:24 He knows that I am faultless, that I have kept myself from doing wrong. 
102Sm 22:25 And so he rewards me because I do what is right, because he knows that I am innocent. 
102Sm 22:26 O LORD, you are faithful to those who are faithful to you, and completely good to those who are perfect. 
102Sm 22:27 You are pure to those who are pure, but hostile to those who are wicked. 
102Sm 22:28 You save those who are humble, but you humble those who are proud. 
102Sm 22:29 You, LORD, are my light; you dispel my darkness. 
102Sm 22:30 You give me strength to attack my enemies and power to overcome their defenses. 
102Sm 22:31 This God - how perfect are his deeds, how dependable his words! He is like a shield for all who seek his protection. 
102Sm 22:32 The LORD alone is God; God alone is our defense. 
102Sm 22:33 This God is my strong refuge; he makes my pathway safe. 
102Sm 22:34 He makes me sure-footed as a deer; he keeps me safe on the mountains. 
102Sm 22:35 He trains me for battle, so that I can use the strongest bow. 
102Sm 22:36 O LORD, you protect me and save me; your help has made me great. 
102Sm 22:37 You have kept me from being captured, and I have never fallen. 
102Sm 22:38 I pursue my enemies and defeat them; I do not stop until I destroy them. 
102Sm 22:39 I strike them down, and they cannot rise; they lie defeated before me. 
102Sm 22:40 You give me strength for the battle and victory over my enemies. 
102Sm 22:41 You make my enemies run from me; I destroy those who hate me. 
102Sm 22:42 They look for help, but no one saves them; they call to the LORD, but he does not answer. 
102Sm 22:43 I crush them, and they become like dust; I trample on them like mud in the streets. 
102Sm 22:44 You saved me from my rebellious people and maintained my rule over the nations; people I did not know have now become my subjects. 
102Sm 22:45 Foreigners bow before me; when they hear me, they obey. 
102Sm 22:46 They lose their courage and come trembling from their fortresses. 
102Sm 22:47 The LORD lives! Praise my defender! Proclaim the greatness of the strong God who saves me! 
102Sm 22:48 He gives me victory over my enemies; he subdues the nations under me 
102Sm 22:49 and saves me from my foes. O LORD, you give me victory over my enemies and protect me from violent men. 
102Sm 22:50 And so I praise you among the nations; I sing praises to you. 
102Sm 22:51 God gives great victories to his king; he shows constant love to the one he has chosen, to David and his descendants forever. 
102Sm 23:1 David son of Jesse was the man whom God made great, whom the God of Jacob chose to be king, and who was the composer of beautiful songs for Israel. These are David's last words�� 102Sm 23:2 The spirit of the LORD speaks through me; his message is on my lips. 
102Sm 23:3 The God of Israel has spoken; the protector of Israel said to me: "The king who rules with justice, who rules in obedience to God, 
102Sm 23:4 is like the sun shining on a cloudless dawn, the sun that makes the grass sparkle after rain." 
102Sm 23:5 And that is how God will bless my descendants, because he has made an eternal covenant with me, an agreement that will not be broken, a promise that will not be changed. That is all I desire; that will be my victory, and God will surely bring it about. 
102Sm 23:6 But godless people are like thorns that are thrown away; no one can touch them barehanded. 
102Sm 23:7 You must use an iron tool or a spear; they will be burned completely. 
102Sm 23:8 These are the names of David's famous soldiers: the first was Josheb Basshebeth from Tachemon, who was the leader of "The Three"; he fought with his spear against eight hundred men and killed them all in one battle. 
102Sm 23:9 The second of the famous three was Eleazar son of Dodo, of the clan of Ahoh. One day he and David challenged the Philistines who had gathered for battle. The Israelites fell back, 
102Sm 23:10 but he stood his ground and fought the Philistines until his hand was so cramped that he could not let go of his sword. The LORD won a great victory that day. After it was over, the Israelites returned to where Eleazar was and stripped the armor from the dead. 
102Sm 23:11 The third of the famous three was Shammah son of Agee from Harar. The Philistines had gathered at Lehi, where there was a field of peas. The Israelites fled from the Philistines, 
102Sm 23:12 but Shammah stood his ground in the field, defended it, and killed the Philistines. The LORD won a great victory that day. 
102Sm 23:13 Near the beginning of harvest time three of "The Thirty" went down to Adullam Cave, where David was, while a band of Philistines was camping in Rephaim Valley. 
102Sm 23:14 At that time David was on a fortified hill, and a group of Philistines had occupied Bethlehem. 
102Sm 23:15 David grew homesick and said, "How I wish someone would bring me a drink of water from the well by the gate at Bethlehem!" 
102Sm 23:16 The three famous soldiers forced their way through the Philistine camp, drew some water from the well, and brought it back to David. But he would not drink it; instead he poured it out as an offering to the LORD 
102Sm 23:17 and said, " LORD, I could never drink this! It would be like drinking the blood of these men who risked their lives!" So he refused to drink it. Those were the brave deeds of the three famous soldiers. 
102Sm 23:18 Joab's brother Abishai (their mother was Zeruiah) was the leader of "The Famous Thirty." He fought with his spear against three hundred men and killed them, and became famous among "The Thirty." 
102Sm 23:19 He was the most famous of "The Thirty" and became their leader, but he was not as famous as "The Three." 
102Sm 23:20 Benaiah son of Jehoiada from Kabzeel was another famous soldier; he did many brave deeds, including killing two great Moabite warriors. He once went down into a pit on a snowy day and killed a lion. 
102Sm 23:21 He also killed an Egyptian, a huge man who was armed with a spear. Benaiah attacked him with his club, snatched the spear from the Egyptian's hand, and killed him with it. 
102Sm 23:22 Those were the brave deeds of Benaiah, who was one of "The Thirty." 
102Sm 23:23 He was outstanding among them, but was not as famous as "The Three." David put him in charge of his bodyguard. 
102Sm 23:24 Other members of "The Thirty" included: Asahel, Joab's brother, Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem,
102Sm 23:25 Shammah and Elika from Harod,
102Sm 23:26 Helez from Pelet, Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa,
102Sm 23:27 Abiezer from Anathoth, Mebunnai from Hushah,
102Sm 23:28 Zalmon from Ahoh, Maharai from Netophah,
102Sm 23:29 Heleb son of Baanah from Netophah, Ittai son of Ribai from Gibeah in Benjamin
102Sm 23:30 Benaiah from Pirathon, Hiddai from the valleys near Gaash,
102Sm 23:31 Abialbon from Arabah, Azmaveth from Bahurim,
102Sm 23:32 Eliahba from Shaalbon. The sons of Jashen Jonathan,
102Sm 23:33 Shammah from Harar, Ahiam son of Sharar from Harar,
102Sm 23:34 Eliphelet son of Ahasbai from Maacah, Eliam son of Ahithophel from Gilo,
102Sm 23:35 Hezro from Carmel, Paarai from Arab,
102Sm 23:36 Igal son of Nathan from Zobah, Bani from Gad
102Sm 23:37 Zelek from Ammon, Naharai from Beeroth, Joab's armorbearer,
102Sm 23:38 Ira and Gareb from Jattir,
102Sm 23:39 Uriah the Hittite. There were thirty-seven famous soldiers in all. 
102Sm 24:1 On another occasion the LORD was angry with Israel, and he made David bring trouble on them. The LORD said to him, "Go and count the people of Israel and Judah." 
102Sm 24:2 So David gave orders to Joab, the commander of his army: "Go with your officers through all the tribes of Israel from one end of the country to the other, and count the people. I want to know how many there are." 
102Sm 24:3 But Joab answered the king, "Your Majesty, may the LORD your God make the people of Israel a hundred times more numerous than they are now, and may you live to see him do it. But why does Your Majesty want to do this?" 
102Sm 24:4 But the king made Joab and his officers obey his order; they left his presence and went out to count the people of Israel. 
102Sm 24:5 They crossed the Jordan and camped south of Aroer, the city in the middle of the valley, in the territory of Gad. From there they went north to Jazer, 
102Sm 24:6 and on to Gilead and to Kadesh, in Hittite territory. Then they went to Dan, and from Dan they went west to Sidon. 
102Sm 24:7 Then they went south to the fortified city of Tyre, on to all the cities of the Hivites and the Canaanites, and finally to Beersheba, in the southern part of Judah. 
102Sm 24:8 So after nine months and twenty days they returned to Jerusalem, having traveled through the whole country. 
102Sm 24:9 They reported to the king the total number of men capable of military service: 800,000 in Israel and 500,000 in Judah. 
102Sm 24:10 But after David had taken the census, his conscience began to hurt, and he said to the LORD, "I have committed a terrible sin in doing this! Please forgive me. I have acted foolishly." 
102Sm 24:11 The LORD said to Gad, David's prophet, "Go and tell David that I am giving him three choices. I will do whichever he chooses." 
102Sm 24:12 The next morning, after David had gotten up, 
102Sm 24:13 Gad went to him, told him what the LORD had said, and asked, "Which is it to be? Three years of famine in your land or three months of running away from your enemies or three days of an epidemic in your land? Now think it over, and tell me what answer to take back to the LORD." 
102Sm 24:14 David answered, "I am in a desperate situation! But I don't want to be punished by people. Let the LORD himself be the one to punish us, for he is merciful." 
102Sm 24:15 So the LORD sent an epidemic on Israel, which lasted from that morning until the time that he had chosen. From one end of the country to the other seventy thousand Israelites died. 
102Sm 24:16 When the LORD's angel was about to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD changed his mind about punishing the people and said to the angel who was killing them, "Stop! That's enough!" The angel was by the threshing place of Araunah, a Jebusite. 
102Sm 24:17 David saw the angel who was killing the people, and said to the LORD, "I am the guilty one. I am the one who did wrong. What have these poor people done? You should punish me and my family." 
102Sm 24:18 That same day Gad went to David and said to him, "Go up to Araunah's threshing place and build an altar to the LORD." 
102Sm 24:19 David obeyed the LORD's command and went as Gad had told him to. 
102Sm 24:20 Araunah looked down and saw the king and his officials coming up to him. He threw himself on the ground in front of David 
102Sm 24:21 and asked, "Your Majesty, why are you here?" David answered, "To buy your threshing place and build an altar for the LORD, in order to stop the epidemic." 
102Sm 24:22 "Take it, Your Majesty," Araunah said, "and offer to the LORD whatever you wish. Here are these oxen to burn as an offering on the altar; here are their yokes and the threshing boards to use as fuel." 
102Sm 24:23 Araunah gave it all to the king and said to him, "May the LORD your God accept your offering." 
102Sm 24:24 But the king answered, "No, I will pay you for it. I will not offer to the LORD my God sacrifices that have cost me nothing." And he bought the threshing place and the oxen for fifty pieces of silver. 
102Sm 24:25 Then he built an altar to the LORD and offered burnt offerings and fellowship offerings. The LORD answered his prayer, and the epidemic in Israel was stopped.
