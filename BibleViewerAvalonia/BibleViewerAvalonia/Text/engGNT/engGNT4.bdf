18
18Jb 1:1 There was a man named Job, living in the land of Uz, who worshiped God and was faithful to him. He was a good man, careful not to do anything evil. 
18Jb 1:2 He had seven sons and three daughters, 
18Jb 1:3 and owned seven thousand sheep, three thousand camels, one thousand head of cattle, and five hundred donkeys. He also had a large number of servants and was the richest man in the East. 
18Jb 1:4 Job's sons used to take turns giving a feast, to which all the others would come, and they always invited their three sisters to join them. 
18Jb 1:5 The morning after each feast, Job would get up early and offer sacrifices for each of his children in order to purify them. He always did this because he thought that one of them might have sinned by insulting God unintentionally. 
18Jb 1:6 When the day came for the heavenly beings to appear before the LORD, Satan was there among them. 
18Jb 1:7 The LORD asked him, "What have you been doing?" Satan answered, "I have been walking here and there, roaming around the earth." 
18Jb 1:8 "Did you notice my servant Job?" the LORD asked. "There is no one on earth as faithful and good as he is. He worships me and is careful not to do anything evil." 
18Jb 1:9 Satan replied, "Would Job worship you if he got nothing out of it? 
18Jb 1:10 You have always protected him and his family and everything he owns. You bless everything he does, and you have given him enough cattle to fill the whole country. 
18Jb 1:11 But now suppose you take away everything he has - he will curse you to your face!" 
18Jb 1:12 "All right," the LORD said to Satan, "everything he has is in your power, but you must not hurt Job himself." So Satan left. 
18Jb 1:13 One day when Job's children were having a feast at the home of their oldest brother, 
18Jb 1:14 a messenger came running to Job. "We were plowing the fields with the oxen," he said, "and the donkeys were in a nearby pasture. 
18Jb 1:15 Suddenly the Sabeans attacked and stole them all. They killed every one of your servants except me. I am the only one who escaped to tell you." 
18Jb 1:16 Before he had finished speaking, another servant came and said, "Lightning struck the sheep and the shepherds and killed them all. I am the only one who escaped to tell you." 
18Jb 1:17 Before he had finished speaking, another servant came and said, "Three bands of Chaldean raiders attacked us, took away the camels, and killed all your servants except me. I am the only one who escaped to tell you." 
18Jb 1:18 Before he had finished speaking, another servant came and said, "Your children were having a feast at the home of your oldest son, 
18Jb 1:19 when a storm swept in from the desert. It blew the house down and killed them all. I am the only one who escaped to tell you." 
18Jb 1:20 Then Job got up and tore his clothes in grief. He shaved his head and threw himself face downward on the ground. 
18Jb 1:21 He said, "I was born with nothing, and I will die with nothing. The LORD gave, and now he has taken away. May his name be praised!" 
18Jb 1:22 In spite of everything that had happened, Job did not sin by blaming God. 
18Jb 2:1 When the day came for the heavenly beings to appear before the LORD again, Satan was there among them. 
18Jb 2:2 The LORD asked him, "Where have you been?" Satan answered, "I have been walking here and there, roaming around the earth." 
18Jb 2:3 "Did you notice my servant Job?" the LORD asked. "There is no one on earth as faithful and good as he is. He worships me and is careful not to do anything evil. You persuaded me to let you attack him for no reason at all, but Job is still as faithful as ever." 
18Jb 2:4 Satan replied, "A person will give up everything in order to stay alive. 
18Jb 2:5 But now suppose you hurt his body - he will curse you to your face!" 
18Jb 2:6 So the LORD said to Satan, "All right, he is in your power, but you are not to kill him." 
18Jb 2:7 Then Satan left the LORD's presence and made sores break out all over Job's body. 
18Jb 2:8 Job went and sat by the garbage dump and took a piece of broken pottery to scrape his sores. 
18Jb 2:9 His wife said to him, "You are still as faithful as ever, aren't you? Why don't you curse God and die?" 
18Jb 2:10 Job answered, "You are talking nonsense! When God sends us something good, we welcome it. How can we complain when he sends us trouble?" Even in all this suffering Job said nothing against God. 
18Jb 2:11 Three of Job's friends were Eliphaz, from the city of Teman, Bildad, from the land of Shuah, and Zophar, from the land of Naamah. When they heard how much Job had been suffering, they decided to go and comfort him. 
18Jb 2:12 While they were still a long way off they saw Job, but did not recognize him. When they did, they began to weep and wail, tearing their clothes in grief and throwing dust into the air and on their heads. 
18Jb 2:13 Then they sat there on the ground with him for seven days and nights without saying a word, because they saw how much he was suffering. 
18Jb 3:1 Finally Job broke the silence and cursed the day on which he had been born. 
18Jb 3:2 O God, put a curse on the day I was born; 
18Jb 3:3 put a curse on the night when I was conceived! 
18Jb 3:4 Turn that day into darkness, God. Never again remember that day; never again let light shine on it. 
18Jb 3:5 Make it a day of gloom and thick darkness; cover it with clouds, and blot out the sun. 
18Jb 3:6 Blot that night out of the year, and never let it be counted again; 
18Jb 3:7 make it a barren, joyless night. 
18Jb 3:8 Tell the sorcerers to curse that day, those who know how to control Leviathan. 
18Jb 3:9 Keep the morning star from shining; give that night no hope of dawn. 
18Jb 3:10 Curse that night for letting me be born, for exposing me to trouble and grief. 
18Jb 3:11 I wish I had died in my mother's womb or died the moment I was born. 
18Jb 3:12 Why did my mother hold me on her knees? Why did she feed me at her breast? 
18Jb 3:13 If I had died then, I would be at rest now, 
18Jb 3:14 sleeping like the kings and rulers who rebuilt ancient palaces. 
18Jb 3:15 Then I would be sleeping like princes who filled their houses with gold and silver, 
18Jb 3:16 or sleeping like a stillborn child. 
18Jb 3:17 In the grave wicked people stop their evil, and tired workers find rest at last. 
18Jb 3:18 Even prisoners enjoy peace, free from shouts and harsh commands. 
18Jb 3:19 Everyone is there, the famous and the unknown, and slaves at last are free. 
18Jb 3:20 Why let people go on living in misery? Why give light to those in grief ? 
18Jb 3:21 They wait for death, but it never comes; they prefer a grave to any treasure. 
18Jb 3:22 They are not happy till they are dead and buried; 
18Jb 3:23 God keeps their future hidden and hems them in on every side. 
18Jb 3:24 Instead of eating, I mourn, and I can never stop groaning. 
18Jb 3:25 Everything I fear and dread comes true. 
18Jb 3:26 I have no peace, no rest, and my troubles never end. 
18Jb 4:1 Job, will you be annoyed if I speak?
18Jb 4:2 I can't keep quiet any longer. 
18Jb 4:3 You have taught many people and given strength to feeble hands. 
18Jb 4:4 When someone stumbled, weak and tired, your words encouraged him to stand. 
18Jb 4:5 Now it's your turn to be in trouble, and you are too stunned to face it. 
18Jb 4:6 You worshiped God, and your life was blameless; and so you should have confidence and hope. 
18Jb 4:7 Think back now. Name a single case where someone righteous met with disaster. 
18Jb 4:8 I have seen people plow fields of evil and plant wickedness like seed; now they harvest wickedness and evil. 
18Jb 4:9 Like a storm, God destroys them in his anger. 
18Jb 4:10 The wicked roar and growl like lions, but God silences them and breaks their teeth. 
18Jb 4:11 Like lions with nothing to kill and eat, they die, and all their children are scattered. 
18Jb 4:12 Once a message came quietly, so quietly I could hardly hear it. 
18Jb 4:13 Like a nightmare it disturbed my sleep. 
18Jb 4:14 I trembled and shuddered; my whole body shook with fear. 
18Jb 4:15 A light breeze touched my face, and my skin crawled with fright. 
18Jb 4:16 I could see something standing there; I stared, but couldn't tell what it was. Then I heard a voice out of the silence�� 
18Jb 4:17 "Can anyone be righteous in the sight of God or be pure before his Creator? 
18Jb 4:18 God does not trust his heavenly servants; he finds fault even with his angels. 
18Jb 4:19 Do you think he will trust a creature of clay, a thing of dust that can be crushed like a moth? 
18Jb 4:20 We may be alive in the morning, but die unnoticed before evening comes. 
18Jb 4:21 All that we have is taken away; we die, still lacking wisdom." 
18Jb 5:1 Call out, Job. See if anyone answers. Is there any angel to whom you can turn? 
18Jb 5:2 To worry yourself to death with resentment would be a foolish, senseless thing to do. 
18Jb 5:3 I have seen fools who looked secure, but I called down a sudden curse on their homes. 
18Jb 5:4 Their children can never find safety; no one stands up to defend them in court. 
18Jb 5:5 Hungry people will eat the fool's crops - even the grain growing among thorns - and thirsty people will envy his wealth. 
18Jb 5:6 Evil does not grow in the soil, nor does trouble grow out of the ground. 
18Jb 5:7 No indeed! We bring trouble on ourselves, as surely as sparks fly up from a fire. 
18Jb 5:8 If I were you, I would turn to God and present my case to him. 
18Jb 5:9 We cannot understand the great things he does, and to his miracles there is no end. 
18Jb 5:10 He sends rain on the land and he waters the fields. 
18Jb 5:11 Yes, it is God who raises the humble and gives joy to all who mourn. 
18Jb 5:12 He upsets the plans of cunning people, 
18Jb 5:13 and traps the wise in their own schemes, so that nothing they do succeeds; 
18Jb 5:14 even at noon they grope in darkness. 
18Jb 5:15 But God saves the poor from death; he saves the needy from oppression. 
18Jb 5:16 He gives hope to the poor and silences the wicked. 
18Jb 5:17 Happy is the person whom God corrects! Do not resent it when he rebukes you. 
18Jb 5:18 God bandages the wounds he makes; his hand hurts you, and his hand heals. 
18Jb 5:19 Time after time he will save you from harm; 
18Jb 5:20 when famine comes, he will keep you alive, and in war protect you from death. 
18Jb 5:21 God will rescue you from slander; he will save you when destruction comes. 
18Jb 5:22 You will laugh at violence and hunger and not be afraid of wild animals. 
18Jb 5:23 The fields you plow will be free of rocks; wild animals will never attack you. 
18Jb 5:24 Then you will live at peace in your tent; when you look at your sheep, you will find them safe. 
18Jb 5:25 You will have as many children as there are blades of grass in a pasture. 
18Jb 5:26 Like wheat that ripens till harvest time, you will live to a ripe old age. 
18Jb 5:27 Job, we have learned this by long study. It is true, so now accept it. 
18Jb 6:1 If my troubles 
18Jb 6:2 and griefs were weighed on scales, 
18Jb 6:3 they would weigh more than the sands of the sea, so my wild words should not surprise you. 
18Jb 6:4 Almighty God has shot me with arrows, and their poison spreads through my body. God has lined up his terrors against me. 
18Jb 6:5 A donkey is content when eating grass, and a cow is quiet when eating hay. 
18Jb 6:6 But who can eat flat, unsalted food? What taste is there in the white of an egg? 
18Jb 6:7 I have no appetite for food like that, and everything I eat makes me sick. 
18Jb 6:8 Why won't God give me what I ask? Why won't he answer my prayer? 
18Jb 6:9 If only he would go ahead and kill me! 
18Jb 6:10 If I knew he would, I would leap for joy, no matter how great my pain. I know that God is holy; I have never opposed what he commands. 
18Jb 6:11 What strength do I have to keep on living? Why go on living when I have no hope? 
18Jb 6:12 Am I made of stone? Is my body bronze? 
18Jb 6:13 I have no strength left to save myself; there is nowhere I can turn for help. 
18Jb 6:14 In trouble like this I need loyal friends - whether I've forsaken God or not. 
18Jb 6:15 But you, my friends, you deceive me like streams that go dry when no rain comes. 
18Jb 6:16 The streams are choked with snow and ice, 
18Jb 6:17 but in the heat they disappear, and the stream beds lie bare and dry. 
18Jb 6:18 Caravans get lost looking for water; they wander and die in the desert. 
18Jb 6:19 Caravans from Sheba and Tema search, 
18Jb 6:20 but their hope dies beside dry streams. 
18Jb 6:21 You are like those streams to me, you see my fate and draw back in fear. 
18Jb 6:22 Have I asked you to give me a gift or to bribe someone on my behalf 
18Jb 6:23 or to save me from some enemy or tyrant? 
18Jb 6:24 All right, teach me; tell me my faults. I will be quiet and listen to you. 
18Jb 6:25 Honest words are convincing, but you are talking nonsense. 
18Jb 6:26 You think I am talking nothing but wind; then why do you answer my words of despair? 
18Jb 6:27 You would even roll dice for orphan slaves and make yourselves rich off your closest friends! 
18Jb 6:28 Look me in the face. I won't lie. 
18Jb 6:29 You have gone far enough. Stop being unjust. Don't condemn me. I'm in the right. 
18Jb 6:30 But you think I am lying - you think I can't tell right from wrong. 
18Jb 7:1 Human life is like forced army service, like a life of hard manual labor, 
18Jb 7:2 like a slave longing for cool shade; like a worker waiting to be paid. 
18Jb 7:3 Month after month I have nothing to live for; night after night brings me grief. 
18Jb 7:4 When I lie down to sleep, the hours drag; I toss all night and long for dawn. 
18Jb 7:5 My body is full of worms; it is covered with scabs; pus runs out of my sores. 
18Jb 7:6 My days pass by without hope, pass faster than a weaver's shuttle. 
18Jb 7:7 Remember, O God, my life is only a breath; my happiness has already ended. 
18Jb 7:8 You see me now, but never again. If you look for me, I'll be gone. 
18Jb 7:9 Like a cloud that fades and is gone, we humans die and never return; 
18Jb 7:10 we are forgotten by all who knew us. 
18Jb 7:11 No! I can't be quiet! I am angry and bitter. I have to speak. 
18Jb 7:12 Why do you keep me under guard? Do you think I am a sea monster? 
18Jb 7:13 I lie down and try to rest; I look for relief from my pain. 
18Jb 7:14 But you - you terrify me with dreams; you send me visions and nightmares 
18Jb 7:15 until I would rather be strangled than live in this miserable body. 
18Jb 7:16 I give up; I am tired of living. Leave me alone. My life makes no sense. 
18Jb 7:17 Why are people so important to you? Why pay attention to what they do? 
18Jb 7:18 You inspect them every morning and test them every minute. 
18Jb 7:19 Won't you look away long enough for me to swallow my spit? 
18Jb 7:20 Are you harmed by my sin, you jailer? Why use me for your target practice? Am I so great a burden to you? 
18Jb 7:21 Can't you ever forgive my sin? Can't you pardon the wrong I do? Soon I will be in my grave, and I'll be gone when you look for me. 
18Jb 8:1 Are you finally 
18Jb 8:2 through with your windy speech? 
18Jb 8:3 God never twists justice; he never fails to do what is right. 
18Jb 8:4 Your children must have sinned against God, and so he punished them as they deserved. 
18Jb 8:5 But turn now and plead with Almighty God; 
18Jb 8:6 if you are so honest and pure, then God will come and help you and restore your household as your reward. 
18Jb 8:7 All the wealth you lost will be nothing compared with what God will give you then. 
18Jb 8:8 Look for a moment at ancient wisdom; consider the truths our ancestors learned. 
18Jb 8:9 Our life is short, we know nothing at all; we pass like shadows across the earth. 
18Jb 8:10 But let the ancient wise people teach you; listen to what they had to say�� 
18Jb 8:11 "Reeds can't grow where there is no water; they are never found outside a swamp. 
18Jb 8:12 If the water dries up, they are the first to wither, while still too small to be cut and used. 
18Jb 8:13 Godless people are like those reeds; their hope is gone, once God is forgotten. 
18Jb 8:14 They trust a thread - a spider's web. 
18Jb 8:15 If they lean on a web, will it hold them up? If they grab for a thread, will it help them stand?" 
18Jb 8:16 Evil people sprout like weeds in the sun, like weeds that spread all through the garden. 
18Jb 8:17 Their roots wrap around the stones and hold fast to every rock. 
18Jb 8:18 But then pull them up - no one will ever know they were there. 
18Jb 8:19 Yes, that's all the joy evil people have; others now come and take their places. 
18Jb 8:20 But God will never abandon the faithful or ever give help to evil people. 
18Jb 8:21 He will let you laugh and shout again, 
18Jb 8:22 but he will bring disgrace on those who hate you, and the homes of the wicked will vanish. 
18Jb 9:1 Yes, I've heard all that before. 
18Jb 9:2 But how can a human being win a case against God? 
18Jb 9:3 How can anyone argue with him? He can ask a thousand questions that no one could ever answer. 
18Jb 9:4 God is so wise and powerful; no one can stand up against him. 
18Jb 9:5 Without warning he moves mountains and in anger he destroys them. 
18Jb 9:6 God sends earthquakes and shakes the ground; he rocks the pillars that support the earth. 
18Jb 9:7 He can keep the sun from rising, and the stars from shining at night. 
18Jb 9:8 No one helped God spread out the heavens or trample the sea monster's back. 
18Jb 9:9 God hung the stars in the sky - the Dipper, Orion, the Pleiades, and the stars of the south. 
18Jb 9:10 We cannot understand the great things he does, and to his miracles there is no end. 
18Jb 9:11 God passes by, but I cannot see him. 
18Jb 9:12 He takes what he wants, and no one can stop him; no one dares ask him, "What are you doing?" 
18Jb 9:13 God's anger is constant. He crushed his enemies who helped Rahab, the sea monster, oppose him. 
18Jb 9:14 So how can I find words to answer God? 
18Jb 9:15 Though I am innocent, all I can do is beg for mercy from God my judge. 
18Jb 9:16 Yet even then, if he lets me speak, I can't believe he would listen to me. 
18Jb 9:17 He sends storms to batter and bruise me without any reason at all. 
18Jb 9:18 He won't let me catch my breath; he has filled my life with bitterness. 
18Jb 9:19 Should I try force? Try force on God? Should I take him to court? Could anyone make him go? 
18Jb 9:20 I am innocent and faithful, but my words sound guilty, and everything I say seems to condemn me. 
18Jb 9:21 I am innocent, but I no longer care. I am sick of living. 
18Jb 9:22 Nothing matters; innocent or guilty, God will destroy us. 
18Jb 9:23 When an innocent person suddenly dies, God laughs. 
18Jb 9:24 God gave the world to the wicked. He made all the judges blind. And if God didn't do it, who did? 
18Jb 9:25 My days race by, not one of them good. 
18Jb 9:26 My life passes like the swiftest boat, as fast as an eagle swooping down on a rabbit. 
18Jb 9:27 If I smile and try to forget my pain, all my suffering comes back to haunt me; 
18Jb 9:28 I know that God does hold me guilty. 
18Jb 9:29 Since I am held guilty, why should I bother? 
18Jb 9:30 No soap can wash away my sins. 
18Jb 9:31 God throws me into a pit with filth, and even my clothes are ashamed of me. 
18Jb 9:32 If God were human, I could answer him; we could go to court to decide our quarrel. 
18Jb 9:33 But there is no one to step between us - no one to judge both God and me. 
18Jb 9:34 Stop punishing me, God! Keep your terrors away! 
18Jb 9:35 I am not afraid. I am going to talk because I know my own heart. 
18Jb 10:1 I am tired of living. Listen to my bitter complaint. 
18Jb 10:2 Don't condemn me, God. Tell me! What is the charge against me? 
18Jb 10:3 Is it right for you to be so cruel? To despise what you yourself have made? And then to smile on the schemes of wicked people? 
18Jb 10:4 Do you see things as we do? 
18Jb 10:5 Is your life as short as ours? 
18Jb 10:6 Then why do you track down all my sins and hunt down every fault I have? 
18Jb 10:7 You know that I am not guilty, that no one can save me from you. 
18Jb 10:8 Your hands formed and shaped me, and now those same hands destroy me. 
18Jb 10:9 Remember that you made me from clay; are you going to crush me back to dust? 
18Jb 10:10 You gave my father strength to beget me; you made me grow in my mother's womb. 
18Jb 10:11 You formed my body with bones and sinews and covered the bones with muscles and skin. 
18Jb 10:12 You have given me life and constant love, and your care has kept me alive. 
18Jb 10:13 But now I know that all that time you were secretly planning to harm me. 
18Jb 10:14 You were watching to see if I would sin, so that you could refuse to forgive me. 
18Jb 10:15 As soon as I sin, I'm in trouble with you, but when I do right, I get no credit. I am miserable and covered with shame. 
18Jb 10:16 If I have any success at all, you hunt me down like a lion; to hurt me you even work miracles. 
18Jb 10:17 You always have some witness against me; your anger toward me grows and grows; you always plan some new attack. 
18Jb 10:18 Why, God, did you let me be born? I should have died before anyone saw me. 
18Jb 10:19 To go from the womb straight to the grave would have been as good as never existing. 
18Jb 10:20 Isn't my life almost over? Leave me alone! Let me enjoy the time I have left. 
18Jb 10:21 I am going soon and will never come back - going to a land that is dark and gloomy, 
18Jb 10:22 a land of darkness, shadows, and confusion, where the light itself is darkness. 
18Jb 11:1 Will no one answer all this nonsense? 
18Jb 11:2 Does talking so much put you in the right? 
18Jb 11:3 Job, do you think we can't answer you? That your mocking words will leave us speechless? 
18Jb 11:4 You claim that what you say is true; you claim you are pure in the sight of God. 
18Jb 11:5 How I wish God would answer you! 
18Jb 11:6 He would tell you there are many sides to wisdom; there are things too deep for human knowledge. God is punishing you less than you deserve. 
18Jb 11:7 Can you discover the limits and bounds of the greatness and power of God? 
18Jb 11:8 The sky is no limit for God, but it lies beyond your reach. God knows the world of the dead, but you do not know it. 
18Jb 11:9 God's greatness is broader than the earth, wider than the sea. 
18Jb 11:10 If God arrests you and brings you to trial, who is there to stop him? 
18Jb 11:11 God knows which people are worthless; he sees all their evil deeds. 
18Jb 11:12 Stupid people will start being wise when wild donkeys are born tame. 
18Jb 11:13 Put your heart right, Job. Reach out to God. 
18Jb 11:14 Put away evil and wrong from your home. 
18Jb 11:15 Then face the world again, firm and courageous. 
18Jb 11:16 Then all your troubles will fade from your memory, like floods that are past and remembered no more. 
18Jb 11:17 Your life will be brighter than sunshine at noon, and life's darkest hours will shine like the dawn. 
18Jb 11:18 You will live secure and full of hope; God will protect you and give you rest. 
18Jb 11:19 You won't be afraid of your enemies; many people will ask you for help. 
18Jb 11:20 But the wicked will look around in despair and find that there is no way to escape. Their one hope is that death will come. 
18Jb 12:1 Yes, you are the voice of the people. 
18Jb 12:2 When you die, wisdom will die with you. 
18Jb 12:3 But I have as much sense as you have; I am in no way inferior to you; everyone knows all that you have said. 
18Jb 12:4 Even my friends laugh at me now; they laugh, although I am righteous and blameless; but there was a time when God answered my prayers. 
18Jb 12:5 You have no troubles, and yet you make fun of me; you hit someone who is about to fall. 
18Jb 12:6 But thieves and godless people live in peace, though their only god is their own strength. 
18Jb 12:7 Even birds and animals have much they could teach you; 
18Jb 12:8 ask the creatures of earth and sea for their wisdom. 
18Jb 12:9 All of them know that the LORD's hand made them. 
18Jb 12:10 It is God who directs the lives of his creatures; everyone's life is in his power. 
18Jb 12:11 But just as your tongue enjoys tasting food, your ears enjoy hearing words. 
18Jb 12:12 Old people have wisdom, but God has wisdom and power. 
18Jb 12:13 Old people have insight; God has insight and power to act. 
18Jb 12:14 When God tears down, who can rebuild, and who can free those God imprisons? 
18Jb 12:15 Drought comes when God withholds rain; floods come when he turns water loose. 
18Jb 12:16 God is strong and always victorious; both deceived and deceiver are in his power. 
18Jb 12:17 He takes away the wisdom of rulers and makes leaders act like fools. 
18Jb 12:18 He dethrones kings and makes them prisoners; 
18Jb 12:19 he humbles priests and men of power. 
18Jb 12:20 He silences those who are trusted, and takes the wisdom of old people away. 
18Jb 12:21 He disgraces those in power and puts an end to the strength of rulers. 
18Jb 12:22 He sends light to places dark as death. 
18Jb 12:23 He makes nations strong and great, but then he defeats and destroys them. 
18Jb 12:24 He makes their leaders foolish and lets them wander confused and lost; 
18Jb 12:25 they grope in the dark and stagger like drunkards. 
18Jb 13:1 Everything you say, I have heard before. 
18Jb 13:2 I understand it all; I know as much as you do. I'm not your inferior. 
18Jb 13:3 But my dispute is with God, not you; I want to argue my case with him. 
18Jb 13:4 You cover up your ignorance with lies; you are like doctors who can't heal anyone. 
18Jb 13:5 Say nothing, and someone may think you are wise! 
18Jb 13:6 Listen while I state my case. 
18Jb 13:7 Why are you lying? Do you think your lies will benefit God? 
18Jb 13:8 Are you trying to defend him? Are you going to argue his case in court? 
18Jb 13:9 If God looks at you closely, will he find anything good? Do you think you can fool God the way you fool others? 
18Jb 13:10 Even though your prejudice is hidden, he will reprimand you, 
18Jb 13:11 and his power will fill you with terror. 
18Jb 13:12 Your proverbs are as useless as ashes; your arguments are as weak as clay. 
18Jb 13:13 Be quiet and give me a chance to speak, and let the results be what they will. 
18Jb 13:14 I am ready to risk my life. 
18Jb 13:15 I've lost all hope, so what if God kills me? I am going to state my case to him. 
18Jb 13:16 It may even be that my boldness will save me, since no wicked person would dare to face God. 
18Jb 13:17 Now listen to my words of explanation. 
18Jb 13:18 I am ready to state my case, because I know I am in the right. 
18Jb 13:19 Are you coming to accuse me, God? If you do, I am ready to be silent and die. 
18Jb 13:20 Let me ask for two things; agree to them, and I will not try to hide from you�� 
18Jb 13:21 stop punishing me, and don't crush me with terror. 
18Jb 13:22 Speak first, O God, and I will answer. Or let me speak, and you answer me. 
18Jb 13:23 What are my sins? What wrongs have I done? What crimes am I charged with? 
18Jb 13:24 Why do you avoid me? Why do you treat me like an enemy? 
18Jb 13:25 Are you trying to frighten me? I'm nothing but a leaf; you are attacking a piece of dry straw. 
18Jb 13:26 You bring bitter charges against me, even for what I did when I was young. 
18Jb 13:27 You bind chains on my feet; you watch every step I take, and even examine my footprints. 
18Jb 13:28 As a result, I crumble like rotten wood, like a moth-eaten coat. 
18Jb 14:1 We are all born weak and helpless. All lead the same short, troubled life. 
18Jb 14:2 We grow and wither as quickly as flowers; we disappear like shadows. 
18Jb 14:3 Will you even look at me, God, or put me on trial and judge me? 
18Jb 14:4 Nothing clean can ever come from anything as unclean as human beings. 
18Jb 14:5 The length of our lives is decided beforehand - the number of months we will live. You have settled it, and it can't be changed. 
18Jb 14:6 Look away from us and leave us alone; let us enjoy our hard life - if we can. 
18Jb 14:7 There is hope for a tree that has been cut down; it can come back to life and sprout. 
18Jb 14:8 Even though its roots grow old, and its stump dies in the ground, 
18Jb 14:9 with water it will sprout like a young plant. 
18Jb 14:10 But we die, and that is the end of us; we die, and where are we then? 
18Jb 14:11 Like rivers that stop running, and lakes that go dry, 
18Jb 14:12 people die, never to rise. They will never wake up while the sky endures; they will never stir from their sleep. 
18Jb 14:13 I wish you would hide me in the world of the dead; let me be hidden until your anger is over, and then set a time to remember me. 
18Jb 14:14 If a man dies, can he come back to life? But I will wait for better times, wait till this time of trouble is ended. 
18Jb 14:15 Then you will call, and I will answer, and you will be pleased with me, your creature. 
18Jb 14:16 Then you will watch every step I take, but you will not keep track of my sins. 
18Jb 14:17 You will forgive them and put them away; you will wipe out all the wrongs I have done. 
18Jb 14:18 There comes a time when mountains fall and solid cliffs are moved away. 
18Jb 14:19 Water will wear down rocks, and heavy rain will wash away the soil; so you destroy our hope for life. 
18Jb 14:20 You overpower us and send us away forever; our faces are twisted in death. 
18Jb 14:21 Our children win honor, but we never know it, nor are we told when they are disgraced. 
18Jb 14:22 We feel only the pain of our own bodies and the grief of our own minds. 
18Jb 15:1 Empty words, Job! 
18Jb 15:2 Empty words! 
18Jb 15:3 No one who is wise would talk the way you do or defend himself with such meaningless words. 
18Jb 15:4 If you had your way, no one would fear God; no one would pray to him. 
18Jb 15:5 Your wickedness is evident by what you say; you are trying to hide behind clever words. 
18Jb 15:6 There is no need for me to condemn you; you are condemned by every word you speak. 
18Jb 15:7 Do you think you were the first person born? Were you there when God made the mountains? 
18Jb 15:8 Did you overhear the plans God made? Does human wisdom belong to you alone? 
18Jb 15:9 There is nothing you know that we don't know. 
18Jb 15:10 We learned our wisdom from gray-haired people - those born before your father. 
18Jb 15:11 God offers you comfort; why still reject it? We have spoken for him with calm, even words. 
18Jb 15:12 But you are excited and glare at us in anger. 
18Jb 15:13 You are angry with God and denounce him. 
18Jb 15:14 Can any human being be really pure? Can anyone be right with God? 
18Jb 15:15 Why, God does not trust even his angels; even they are not pure in his sight. 
18Jb 15:16 And we drink evil as if it were water; yes, we are corrupt; we are worthless. 
18Jb 15:17 Now listen, Job, to what I know. 
18Jb 15:18 Those who are wise have taught me truths which they learned from their ancestors, and they kept no secrets hidden. 
18Jb 15:19 Their land was free from foreigners; there was no one to lead them away from God. 
18Jb 15:20 The wicked who oppress others will be in torment as long as they live. 
18Jb 15:21 Voices of terror will scream in their ears, and robbers attack when they think they are safe. 
18Jb 15:22 They have no hope of escaping from darkness, for somewhere a sword is waiting to kill them, 
18Jb 15:23 and vultures are waiting to eat their corpses. They know their future is dark; 
18Jb 15:24 disaster, like a powerful king, is waiting to attack them. 
18Jb 15:25 That is the fate of those who shake their fists at God and defy the Almighty. 
18Jb 15:26 They are proud and rebellious; 
18Jb 15:27 they stubbornly hold up their shields and rush to fight against God. 
18Jb 15:28 They are the ones who captured cities and seized houses whose owners had fled, but war will destroy those cities and houses. 
18Jb 15:29 They will not remain rich for long; nothing they own will last. Even their shadows will vanish, 
18Jb 15:30 and they will not escape from darkness. They will be like trees whose branches are burned by fire, whose blossoms are blown away by the wind. 
18Jb 15:31 If they are foolish enough to trust in evil, then evil will be their reward. 
18Jb 15:32 Before their time is up they will wither, wither like a branch and never be green again. 
18Jb 15:33 They will be like vines that lose their unripe grapes; like olive trees that drop their blossoms. 
18Jb 15:34 There will be no descendants for godless people, and fire will destroy the homes built by bribery. 
18Jb 15:35 These are the ones who plan trouble and do evil; their hearts are always full of deceit. 
18Jb 16:1 I have heard words like that before; 
18Jb 16:2 the comfort you give is only torment. 
18Jb 16:3 Are you going to keep on talking forever? Do you always have to have the last word? 
18Jb 16:4 If you were in my place and I in yours, I could say everything you are saying. I could shake my head wisely and drown you with a flood of words. 
18Jb 16:5 I could strengthen you with advice and keep talking to comfort you. 
18Jb 16:6 But nothing I say helps, and being silent does not calm my pain. 
18Jb 16:7 You have worn me out, God; you have let my family be killed. 
18Jb 16:8 You have seized me; you are my enemy. I am skin and bones, and people take that as proof of my guilt. 
18Jb 16:9 In anger God tears me limb from limb; he glares at me with hate. 
18Jb 16:10 People sneer at me; they crowd around me and slap my face. 
18Jb 16:11 God has handed me over to evil people. 
18Jb 16:12 I was living in peace, but God took me by the throat and battered me and crushed me. God uses me for target practice 
18Jb 16:13 and shoots arrows at me from every side - arrows that pierce and wound me; and even then he shows no pity. 
18Jb 16:14 He wounds me again and again; he attacks like a soldier gone mad with hate. 
18Jb 16:15 I mourn and wear clothes made of sackcloth, and I sit here in the dust defeated. 
18Jb 16:16 I have cried until my face is red, and my eyes are swollen and circled with shadows, 
18Jb 16:17 but I am not guilty of any violence, and my prayer to God is sincere. 
18Jb 16:18 O Earth, don't hide the wrongs done to me! Don't let my call for justice be silenced! 
18Jb 16:19 There is someone in heaven to stand up for me and take my side. 
18Jb 16:20 My friends scorn me; my eyes pour out tears to God. 
18Jb 16:21 I want someone to plead with God for me, as one pleads for a friend. 
18Jb 16:22 My years are passing now, and I walk the road of no return. 
18Jb 17:1 The end of my life is near. I can hardly breathe; there is nothing left for me but the grave. 
18Jb 17:2 I watch how bitterly everyone mocks me. 
18Jb 17:3 I am being honest, God. Accept my word. There is no one else to support what I say. 
18Jb 17:4 You have closed their minds to reason; don't let them triumph over me now. 
18Jb 17:5 In the old proverb someone betrays his friends for money, and his children suffer for it. 
18Jb 17:6 And now people use this proverb against me; they come and spit in my face. 
18Jb 17:7 My grief has almost made me blind; my arms and legs are as thin as shadows. 
18Jb 17:8 Those who claim to be honest are shocked, and they all condemn me as godless. 
18Jb 17:9 Those who claim to be respectable are more and more convinced they are right. 
18Jb 17:10 But if all of them came and stood before me, I would not find even one of them wise. 
18Jb 17:11 My days have passed; my plans have failed; my hope is gone. 
18Jb 17:12 But my friends say night is daylight; they say that light is near, but I know I remain in darkness. 
18Jb 17:13 My only hope is the world of the dead, where I will lie down to sleep in the dark. 
18Jb 17:14 I will call the grave my father, and the worms that eat me I will call my mother and my sisters. 
18Jb 17:15 Where is there any hope for me? Who sees any? 
18Jb 17:16 Hope will not go with me when I go down to the world of the dead. 
18Jb 18:1 Job, can't people like you ever be quiet? 
18Jb 18:2 If you stopped to listen, we could talk to you. 
18Jb 18:3 What makes you think we are as stupid as cattle? 
18Jb 18:4 You are only hurting yourself with your anger. Will the earth be deserted because you are angry? Will God move mountains to satisfy you? 
18Jb 18:5 The light of the wicked will still be put out; its flame will never burn again. 
18Jb 18:6 The lamp in their tents will be darkened. 
18Jb 18:7 Their steps were firm, but now they stumble; they fall - victims of their own advice. 
18Jb 18:8 They walk into a net, and their feet are caught; 
18Jb 18:9 a trap catches their heels and holds them. 
18Jb 18:10 On the ground a snare is hidden; a trap has been set in their path. 
18Jb 18:11 All around them terror is waiting; it follows them at every step. 
18Jb 18:12 They used to be rich, but now they go hungry; disaster stands and waits at their side. 
18Jb 18:13 A deadly disease spreads over their bodies and causes their arms and legs to rot. 
18Jb 18:14 They are torn from the tents where they lived secure, and are dragged off to face King Death. 
18Jb 18:15 Now anyone may live in their tents - after sulfur is sprinkled to disinfect them! 
18Jb 18:16 Their roots and branches are withered and dry. 
18Jb 18:17 Their fame is ended at home and abroad; no one remembers them any more. 
18Jb 18:18 They will be driven out of the land of the living, driven from light into darkness. 
18Jb 18:19 They have no descendants, no survivors. 
18Jb 18:20 From east to west, all who hear of their fate shudder and tremble with fear. 
18Jb 18:21 That is the fate of evil people, the fate of those who care nothing for God. 
18Jb 19:1 Why do you keep tormenting me 
18Jb 19:2 with words? 
18Jb 19:3 Time after time you insult me and show no shame for the way you abuse me. 
18Jb 19:4 Even if I have done wrong, how does that hurt you? 
18Jb 19:5 You think you are better than I am, and regard my troubles as proof of my guilt. 
18Jb 19:6 Can't you see it is God who has done this? He has set a trap to catch me. 
18Jb 19:7 I protest his violence, but no one is listening; no one hears my cry for justice. 
18Jb 19:8 God has blocked the way, and I can't get through; he has hidden my path in darkness. 
18Jb 19:9 He has taken away all my wealth and destroyed my reputation. 
18Jb 19:10 He batters me from every side. He uproots my hope and leaves me to wither and die. 
18Jb 19:11 God is angry and rages against me; he treats me like his worst enemy. 
18Jb 19:12 He sends his army to attack me; they dig trenches and lay siege to my tent. 
18Jb 19:13 God has made my own family forsake me; I am a stranger to those who knew me; 
18Jb 19:14 my relatives and friends are gone. 
18Jb 19:15 Those who were guests in my house have forgotten me; my servant women treat me like a stranger and a foreigner. 
18Jb 19:16 When I call a servant, he doesn't answer - even when I beg him to help me. 
18Jb 19:17 My wife can't stand the smell of my breath, and my own brothers won't come near me. 
18Jb 19:18 Children despise me and laugh when they see me. 
18Jb 19:19 My closest friends look at me with disgust; those I loved most have turned against me. 
18Jb 19:20 My skin hangs loose on my bones; I have barely escaped with my life. 
18Jb 19:21 You are my friends! Take pity on me! The hand of God has struck me down. 
18Jb 19:22 Why must you persecute me the way God does? Haven't you tormented me enough? 
18Jb 19:23 How I wish that someone would remember my words and record them in a book! 
18Jb 19:24 Or with a chisel carve my words in stone and write them so that they would last forever. 
18Jb 19:25 But I know there is someone in heaven who will come at last to my defense. 
18Jb 19:26 Even after my skin is eaten by disease, while still in this body I will see God. 
18Jb 19:27 I will see him with my own eyes, and he will not be a stranger. My courage failed because you said, 
18Jb 19:28 "How can we torment him?" You looked for some excuse to attack me. 
18Jb 19:29 But now, be afraid of the sword - the sword that brings God's wrath on sin, so that you will know there is one who judges. 
18Jb 20:1 Job, you upset me. 
18Jb 20:2 Now I'm impatient to answer. 
18Jb 20:3 What you have said is an insult, but I know how to reply to you. 
18Jb 20:4 Surely you know that from ancient times, when we humans were first placed on earth, 
18Jb 20:5 no wicked people have been happy for long. 
18Jb 20:6 They may grow great, towering to the sky, so great that their heads reach the clouds, 
18Jb 20:7 but they will be blown away like dust. Those who used to know them will wonder where they have gone. 
18Jb 20:8 They will vanish like a dream, like a vision at night, and never be seen again. 
18Jb 20:9 The wicked will disappear from the place where they used to live; 
18Jb 20:10 and their children will make good what they stole from the poor. 
18Jb 20:11 Their bodies used to be young and vigorous, but soon they will turn to dust. 
18Jb 20:12 Evil tastes so good to them that they keep some 
18Jb 20:13 in their mouths to enjoy its flavor. 
18Jb 20:14 But in their stomachs the food turns bitter, as bitter as any poison could be. 
18Jb 20:15 The wicked vomit up the wealth they stole; God takes it back, even out of their stomachs. 
18Jb 20:16 What the evil people swallow is like poison; it kills them like the bite of a deadly snake. 
18Jb 20:17 They will not live to see rivers of olive oil or streams that flow with milk and honey. 
18Jb 20:18 They will have to give up all they have worked for; they will have no chance to enjoy their wealth, 
18Jb 20:19 because they oppressed and neglected the poor and seized houses someone else had built. 
18Jb 20:20 Their greed is never satisfied. 
18Jb 20:21 When they eat, there is nothing left over, but now their prosperity comes to an end. 
18Jb 20:22 At the height of their success all the weight of misery will crush them. 
18Jb 20:23 Let them eat all they want! God will punish them in fury and anger. 
18Jb 20:24 When they try to escape from an iron sword, a bronze bow will shoot them down. 
18Jb 20:25 Arrows stick through their bodies; the shiny points drip with their blood, and terror grips their hearts. 
18Jb 20:26 Everything they have saved is destroyed; a fire not lit by human hands burns them and all their family. 
18Jb 20:27 Heaven reveals their sin, and the earth gives testimony against them. 
18Jb 20:28 All their wealth will be destroyed in the flood of God's anger. 
18Jb 20:29 This is the fate of wicked people, the fate that God assigns to them. 
18Jb 21:1 Listen to what I am saying; 
18Jb 21:2 that is all the comfort I ask from you. 
18Jb 21:3 Give me a chance to speak and then, when I am through, sneer if you like. 
18Jb 21:4 My quarrel is not with mortals; I have good reason to be impatient. 
18Jb 21:5 Look at me. Isn't that enough to make you stare in shocked silence? 
18Jb 21:6 When I think of what has happened to me, I am stunned, and I tremble and shake. 
18Jb 21:7 Why does God let evil people live, let them grow old and prosper? 
18Jb 21:8 They have children and grandchildren, and live to watch them all grow up. 
18Jb 21:9 God does not bring disaster on their homes; they never have to live in terror. 
18Jb 21:10 Yes, all their cattle breed and give birth without trouble. 
18Jb 21:11 Their children run and play like lambs 
18Jb 21:12 and dance to the music of harps and flutes. 
18Jb 21:13 They live out their lives in peace and quietly die without suffering. 
18Jb 21:14 The wicked tell God to leave them alone; they don't want to know his will for their lives. 
18Jb 21:15 They think there is no need to serve God nor any advantage in praying to him. 
18Jb 21:16 They claim they succeed by their own strength, but their way of thinking I can't accept. 
18Jb 21:17 Was a wicked person's light ever put out? Did one of them ever meet with disaster? Did God ever punish the wicked in anger 
18Jb 21:18 and blow them away like straw in the wind, or like dust carried away in a storm? 
18Jb 21:19 You claim God punishes a child for the sins of his father. No! Let God punish the sinners themselves; let him show that he does it because of {\I their sins.
18Jb 21:20 Let sinners bear their own punishment; let them feel the wrath of Almighty God. 
18Jb 21:21 When our lives are over, do we really care whether our children are happy? 
18Jb 21:22 Can anyone teach God, who judges even those in high places? 
18Jb 21:23 Some people stay healthy till the day they die; 
18Jb 21:24 they die happy and at ease, their bodies well-nourished. 
18Jb 21:25 Others have no happiness at all; they live and die with bitter hearts. 
18Jb 21:26 But all alike die and are buried; they all are covered with worms. 
18Jb 21:27 I know what spiteful thoughts you have. 
18Jb 21:28 You ask, "Where are the homes of great people now, those who practiced evil?" 
18Jb 21:29 Haven't you talked with people who travel? Don't you know the reports they bring back? 
18Jb 21:30 On the day God is angry and punishes, it is the wicked who are always spared. 
18Jb 21:31 There is no one to accuse the wicked or pay them back for all they have done. 
18Jb 21:32 When they are carried to the graveyard, to their well-guarded tombs, 
18Jb 21:33 thousands join the funeral procession, and even the earth lies gently on their bodies. 
18Jb 21:34 And you! You try to comfort me with nonsense! Every answer you give is a lie! 
18Jb 22:1 Is there anyone, even the wisest, 
18Jb 22:2 who could ever be of use to God? 
18Jb 22:3 Does your doing right benefit God, or does your being good help him at all? 
18Jb 22:4 It is not because you stand in awe of God that he reprimands you and brings you to trial. 
18Jb 22:5 No, it's because you have sinned so much; it's because of all the evil you do. 
18Jb 22:6 To make a brother repay you the money he owed, you took away his clothes and left him nothing to wear. 
18Jb 22:7 You refused water to those who were tired, and refused to feed those who were hungry. 
18Jb 22:8 You used your power and your position to take over the whole land. 
18Jb 22:9 You not only refused to help widows, but you also robbed and mistreated orphans. 
18Jb 22:10 So now there are pitfalls all around you, and suddenly you are full of fear. 
18Jb 22:11 It has grown so dark that you cannot see, and a flood overwhelms you. 
18Jb 22:12 Doesn't God live in the highest heavens and look down on the stars, even though they are high? 
18Jb 22:13 And yet you ask, "What does God know? He is hidden by clouds - how can he judge us?" 
18Jb 22:14 You think the thick clouds keep him from seeing, as he walks on the dome of the sky. 
18Jb 22:15 Are you determined to walk in the paths that evil people have always followed? 
18Jb 22:16 Even before their time had come, they were washed away by a flood. 
18Jb 22:17 These are the ones who rejected God and believed that he could do nothing to them. 
18Jb 22:18 And yet it was God who made them prosperous - I can't understand the thoughts of the wicked. 
18Jb 22:19 Good people are glad and the innocent laugh when they see the wicked punished. 
18Jb 22:20 All that the wicked own is destroyed, and fire burns up anything that is left. 
18Jb 22:21 Now, Job, make peace with God and stop treating him like an enemy; if you do, then he will bless you. 
18Jb 22:22 Accept the teaching he gives; keep his words in your heart. 
18Jb 22:23 Yes, you must humbly return to God and put an end to all the evil that is done in your house. 
18Jb 22:24 Throw away your gold; dump your finest gold in the dry stream bed. 
18Jb 22:25 Let Almighty God be your gold, and let him be silver, piled high for you. 
18Jb 22:26 Then you will always trust in God and find that he is the source of your joy. 
18Jb 22:27 When you pray, he will answer you, and you will keep the vows you made. 
18Jb 22:28 You will succeed in all you do, and light will shine on your path. 
18Jb 22:29 God brings down the proud and saves the humble. 
18Jb 22:30 He will rescue you if you are innocent, if what you do is right. 
18Jb 23:1 I still rebel and complain against God;
18Jb 23:2 I cannot keep from groaning. 
18Jb 23:3 How I wish I knew where to find him, and knew how to go where he is. 
18Jb 23:4 I would state my case before him and present all the arguments in my favor. 
18Jb 23:5 I want to know what he would say and how he would answer me. 
18Jb 23:6 Would God use all his strength against me? No, he would listen as I spoke. 
18Jb 23:7 I am honest; I could reason with God; he would declare me innocent once and for all. 
18Jb 23:8 I have searched in the East, but God is not there; I have not found him when I searched in the West. 
18Jb 23:9 God has been at work in the North and the South, but still I have not seen him. 
18Jb 23:10 Yet God knows every step I take; if he tests me, he will find me pure. 
18Jb 23:11 I follow faithfully the road he chooses, and never wander to either side. 
18Jb 23:12 I always do what God commands; I follow his will, not my own desires. 
18Jb 23:13 He never changes. No one can oppose him or stop him from doing what he wants to do. 
18Jb 23:14 He will fulfill what he has planned for me; that plan is just one of the many he has; 
18Jb 23:15 I tremble with fear before him. 
18Jb 23:16 Almighty God has destroyed my courage. 
18Jb 23:17 It is God, not the dark, that makes me afraid - even though the darkness has made me blind. 
18Jb 24:1 Why doesn't God set a time for judging, a day of justice for those who serve him? 
18Jb 24:2 People move property lines to get more land; they steal sheep and put them with their own flocks. 
18Jb 24:3 They take donkeys that belong to orphans, and keep a widow's ox till she pays her debts. 
18Jb 24:4 They prevent the poor from getting their rights and force the needy to run and hide. 
18Jb 24:5 So the poor, like wild donkeys, search for food in the dry wilderness; nowhere else can they find food for their children. 
18Jb 24:6 They have to harvest fields they don't own, and gather grapes in vineyards of the wicked. 
18Jb 24:7 At night they sleep with nothing to cover them, nothing to keep them from the cold. 
18Jb 24:8 They are drenched by the rain that falls on the mountains, and they huddle beside the rocks for shelter. 
18Jb 24:9 Evil people make slaves of fatherless infants and take the children of the poor in payment for debts. 
18Jb 24:10 But the poor must go out with no clothes to protect them; they must go hungry while harvesting wheat. 
18Jb 24:11 They press olives for oil, and grapes for wine, but they themselves are thirsty. 
18Jb 24:12 In the cities the wounded and dying cry out, but God ignores their prayers. 
18Jb 24:13 There are those who reject the light; they don't understand it or go where it leads. 
18Jb 24:14 At dawn the murderer gets up and goes out to kill the poor, and at night he steals. 
18Jb 24:15 The adulterer waits for twilight to come; he covers his face so that no one can see him. 
18Jb 24:16 At night thieves break into houses, but by day they hide and avoid the light. 
18Jb 24:17 They fear the light of day, but darkness holds no terror for them. 
18Jb 24:18 The wicked are swept away by floods, and the land they own is under God's curse; they no longer go to work in their vineyards. 
18Jb 24:19 As snow vanishes in heat and drought, so sinners vanish from the land of the living. 
18Jb 24:20 Not even their mothers remember them now; they are eaten by worms and destroyed like fallen trees. 
18Jb 24:21 That happens because they mistreated widows and showed no kindness to childless women. 
18Jb 24:22 God, in his strength, destroys the mighty; God acts - and the wicked die. 
18Jb 24:23 God may let them live secure, but keeps an eye on them all the time. 
18Jb 24:24 For a while the wicked prosper, but then they wither like weeds, like stalks of grain that have been cut down. 
18Jb 24:25 Can anyone deny that this is so? Can anyone prove that my words are not true? 
18Jb 25:1 God is powerful; all must stand in awe of him; 
18Jb 25:2 he keeps his heavenly kingdom in peace. 
18Jb 25:3 Can anyone count the angels who serve him? Is there any place where God's light does not shine? 
18Jb 25:4 Can anyone be righteous or pure in God's sight? 
18Jb 25:5 In his eyes even the moon is not bright, or the stars pure. 
18Jb 25:6 Then what about a human being, that worm, that insect? What is a human life worth in God's eyes? 
18Jb 26:1 What a big help you are to me - 
18Jb 26:2 poor, weak man that I am! 
18Jb 26:3 You give such good advice and share your knowledge with a fool like me! 
18Jb 26:4 Who do you think will hear all your words? Who inspired you to speak like this? 
18Jb 26:5 The spirits of the dead tremble in the waters under the earth. 
18Jb 26:6 The world of the dead lies open to God; no covering shields it from his sight. 
18Jb 26:7 God stretched out the northern sky and hung the earth in empty space. 
18Jb 26:8 It is God who fills the clouds with water and keeps them from bursting with the weight. 
18Jb 26:9 He hides the full moon behind a cloud. 
18Jb 26:10 He divided light from darkness by a circle drawn on the face of the sea. 
18Jb 26:11 When he threatens the pillars that hold up the sky, they shake and tremble with fear. 
18Jb 26:12 It is his strength that conquered the sea; by his skill he destroyed the monster Rahab. 
18Jb 26:13 It is his breath that made the sky clear, and his hand that killed the escaping monster. 
18Jb 26:14 But these are only hints of his power, only the whispers that we have heard. Who can know how truly great God is? 
18Jb 27:1 I swear by the living Almighty God, 
18Jb 27:2 who refuses me justice and makes my life bitter - 
18Jb 27:3 as long as God gives me breath, 
18Jb 27:4 my lips will never say anything evil, my tongue will never tell a lie. 
18Jb 27:5 I will never say that you men are right; I will insist on my innocence to my dying day. 
18Jb 27:6 I will never give up my claim to be right; my conscience is clear. 
18Jb 27:7 May all who oppose me and fight against me be punished like the wicked and the unrighteous. 
18Jb 27:8 What hope is there for the godless in the hour when God demands their life? 
18Jb 27:9 When trouble comes, will God hear their cries? 
18Jb 27:10 They should have desired the joy he gives; they should have constantly prayed to him. 
18Jb 27:11 Let me teach you how great is God's power, and explain what Almighty God has planned. 
18Jb 27:12 But no, after all, you have seen for yourselves; so why do you talk such nonsense? 
18Jb 27:13 This is how Almighty God punishes wicked, violent people. 
18Jb 27:14 They may have many sons, but all will be killed in war; their children never have enough to eat. 
18Jb 27:15 Those who survive will die from disease, and even their widows will not mourn their death. 
18Jb 27:16 The wicked may have too much silver to count and more clothes than anyone needs; 
18Jb 27:17 but some good person will wear the clothes, and someone honest will get the silver. 
18Jb 27:18 The wicked build houses like a spider's web or like the hut of a slave guarding the fields. 
18Jb 27:19 One last time they will lie down rich, and when they wake up, they will find their wealth gone. 
18Jb 27:20 Terror will strike like a sudden flood; a wind in the night will blow them away; 
18Jb 27:21 the east wind will sweep them from their homes; 
18Jb 27:22 it will blow down on them without pity while they try their best to escape. 
18Jb 27:23 The wind howls at them as they run, frightening them with destructive power. 
18Jb 28:1 There are mines where silver is dug; There are places where gold is refined. 
18Jb 28:2 We dig iron out of the ground And melt copper out of the stones. 
18Jb 28:3 Miners explore the deepest darkness. They search the depths of the earth And dig for rocks in the darkness. 
18Jb 28:4 Far from where anyone lives Or human feet ever travel, They dig the shafts of mines. There they work in loneliness, Clinging to ropes in the pits. 
18Jb 28:5 Food grows out of the earth, But underneath the same earth All is torn up and crushed. 
18Jb 28:6 The stones of the earth contain sapphires, And its dust contains gold. 
18Jb 28:7 No hawk sees the roads to the mines, And no vulture ever flies over them. 
18Jb 28:8 No lion or other fierce beast Ever travels those lonely roads. 
18Jb 28:9 Miners dig the hardest rocks, Dig mountains away at their base. 
18Jb 28:10 As they tunnel through the rocks, They discover precious stones. 
18Jb 28:11 They dig to the sources of rivers And bring to light what is hidden. 
18Jb 28:12 But where can wisdom be found? Where can we learn to understand? 
18Jb 28:13 Wisdom is not to be found among mortals; No one knows its true value. 
18Jb 28:14 The depths of the oceans and seas Say that wisdom is not found there. 
18Jb 28:15 It cannot be bought with silver or gold. 
18Jb 28:16 The finest gold and jewels Cannot equal its value. 
18Jb 28:17 It is worth more than gold, Than a gold vase or finest glass. 
18Jb 28:18 The value of wisdom is more Than coral or crystal or rubies. 
18Jb 28:19 The finest topaz and the purest gold Cannot compare with the value of wisdom. 
18Jb 28:20 Where, then, is the source of wisdom? Where can we learn to understand? 
18Jb 28:21 No living creature can see it, Not even a bird in flight. 
18Jb 28:22 Even death and destruction Admit they have heard only rumors. 
18Jb 28:23 God alone knows the way, Knows the place where wisdom is found, 
18Jb 28:24 Because he sees the ends of the earth, Sees everything under the sky. 
18Jb 28:25 When God gave the wind its power And determined the size of the sea; 
18Jb 28:26 When God decided where the rain would fall, And the path that the thunderclouds travel; 
18Jb 28:27 It was then he saw wisdom and tested its worth - He gave it his approval. 
18Jb 28:28 God said to us humans, "To be wise, you must have reverence for the Lord. To understand, you must turn from evil." 
18Jb 29:1 Job began speaking again. 
18Jb 29:2 If only my life could once again be as it was when God watched over me. 
18Jb 29:3 God was always with me then and gave me light as I walked through the darkness. 
18Jb 29:4 Those were the days when I was prosperous, and the friendship of God protected my home. 
18Jb 29:5 Almighty God was with me then, and I was surrounded by all my children. 
18Jb 29:6 My cows and goats gave plenty of milk, and my olive trees grew in the rockiest soil. 
18Jb 29:7 Whenever the city elders met and I took my place among them, 
18Jb 29:8 young men stepped aside as soon as they saw me, and old men stood up to show me respect. 
18Jb 29:9 The leaders of the people would stop talking; 
18Jb 29:10 even the most important men kept silent. 
18Jb 29:11 Everyone who saw me or heard of me had good things to say about what I had done. 
18Jb 29:12 When the poor cried out, I helped them; I gave help to orphans who had nowhere to turn. 
18Jb 29:13 People who were in deepest misery praised me, and I helped widows find security. 
18Jb 29:14 I have always acted justly and fairly. 
18Jb 29:15 I was eyes for the blind, and feet for the lame. 
18Jb 29:16 I was like a father to the poor and took the side of strangers in trouble. 
18Jb 29:17 I destroyed the power of cruel men and rescued their victims. 
18Jb 29:18 I always expected to live a long life and to die at home in comfort. 
18Jb 29:19 I was like a tree whose roots always have water and whose branches are wet with dew. 
18Jb 29:20 Everyone was always praising me, and my strength never failed me. 
18Jb 29:21 When I gave advice, people were silent and listened carefully to what I said; 
18Jb 29:22 they had nothing to add when I had finished. My words sank in like drops of rain; 
18Jb 29:23 everyone welcomed them just as farmers welcome rain in spring. 
18Jb 29:24 I smiled on them when they had lost confidence; my cheerful face encouraged them. 
18Jb 29:25 I took charge and made the decisions; I led them as a king leads his troops, and gave them comfort in their despair. 
18Jb 30:1 But men younger than I am make fun of me now! Their fathers have always been so worthless that I wouldn't let them help my dogs guard sheep. 
18Jb 30:2 They were a bunch of worn-out men, too weak to do any work for me. 
18Jb 30:3 They were so poor and hungry that they would gnaw dry roots - at night, in wild, desolate places. 
18Jb 30:4 They pulled up the plants of the desert and ate them, even the tasteless roots of the broom tree! 
18Jb 30:5 Everyone drove them away with shouts, as if they were shouting at thieves. 
18Jb 30:6 They had to live in caves, in holes dug in the sides of cliffs. 
18Jb 30:7 Out in the wilds they howled like animals and huddled together under the bushes. 
18Jb 30:8 A worthless bunch of nameless nobodies! They were driven out of the land. 
18Jb 30:9 Now they come and laugh at me; I am nothing but a joke to them. 
18Jb 30:10 They treat me with disgust; they think they are too good for me, and even come and spit in my face. 
18Jb 30:11 Because God has made me weak and helpless, they turn against me with all their fury. 
18Jb 30:12 This mob attacks me head-on; they send me running; they prepare their final assault. 
18Jb 30:13 They cut off my escape and try to destroy me; and there is no one to stop them. 
18Jb 30:14 They pour through the holes in my defenses and come crashing down on top of me; 
18Jb 30:15 I am overcome with terror; my dignity is gone like a puff of wind, and my prosperity like a cloud. 
18Jb 30:16 Now I am about to die; there is no relief for my suffering. 
18Jb 30:17 At night my bones all ache; the pain that gnaws me never stops. 
18Jb 30:18 God seizes me by my collar and twists my clothes out of shape. 
18Jb 30:19 He throws me down in the mud; I am no better than dirt. 
18Jb 30:20 I call to you, O God, but you never answer; and when I pray, you pay no attention. 
18Jb 30:21 You are treating me cruelly; you persecute me with all your power. 
18Jb 30:22 You let the wind blow me away; you toss me about in a raging storm. 
18Jb 30:23 I know you are taking me off to my death, to the fate in store for everyone. 
18Jb 30:24 Why do you attack a ruined man, one who can do nothing but beg for pity? 
18Jb 30:25 Didn't I weep with people in trouble and feel sorry for those in need? 
18Jb 30:26 I hoped for happiness and light, but trouble and darkness came instead. 
18Jb 30:27 I am torn apart by worry and pain; I have had day after day of suffering. 
18Jb 30:28 I go about in gloom, without any sunshine; I stand up in public and plead for help. 
18Jb 30:29 My voice is as sad and lonely as the cries of a jackal or an ostrich. 
18Jb 30:30 My skin has turned dark; I am burning with fever. 
18Jb 30:31 Where once I heard joyful music, now I hear only mourning and weeping. 
18Jb 31:1 I have made a solemn promise never to look with lust at a woman. 
18Jb 31:2 What does Almighty God do to us? How does he repay human deeds? 
18Jb 31:3 He sends disaster and ruin to those who do wrong. 
18Jb 31:4 God knows everything I do; he sees every step I take. 
18Jb 31:5 I swear I have never acted wickedly and never tried to deceive others. 
18Jb 31:6 Let God weigh me on honest scales, and he will see how innocent I am. 
18Jb 31:7 If I have turned from the right path or let myself be attracted to evil, if my hands are stained with sin, 
18Jb 31:8 then let my crops be destroyed, or let others eat the food I grow. 
18Jb 31:9 If I have been attracted to my neighbor's wife, and waited, hidden, outside her door, 
18Jb 31:10 then let my wife cook another man's food and sleep in another man's bed. 
18Jb 31:11 Such wickedness should be punished by death. 
18Jb 31:12 It would be like a destructive, hellish fire, consuming everything I have. 
18Jb 31:13 When any of my servants complained against me, I would listen and treat them fairly. 
18Jb 31:14 If I did not, how could I then face God? What could I say when God came to judge me? 
18Jb 31:15 The same God who created me created my servants also. 
18Jb 31:16 I have never refused to help the poor; never have I let widows live in despair 
18Jb 31:17 or let orphans go hungry while I ate. 
18Jb 31:18 All my life I have taken care of them. 
18Jb 31:19 When I found someone in need, too poor to buy clothes, 
18Jb 31:20 I would give him clothing made of wool that had come from my own flock of sheep. Then he would praise me with all his heart. 
18Jb 31:21 If I have ever cheated an orphan, knowing I could win in court, 
18Jb 31:22 then may my arms be broken; may they be torn from my shoulders. 
18Jb 31:23 Because I fear God's punishment, I could never do such a thing. 
18Jb 31:24 I have never trusted in riches 
18Jb 31:25 or taken pride in my wealth. 
18Jb 31:26 I have never worshiped the sun in its brightness or the moon in all its beauty. 
18Jb 31:27 I have not been led astray to honor them by kissing my hand in reverence to them. 
18Jb 31:28 Such a sin should be punished by death; it denies Almighty God. 
18Jb 31:29 I have never been glad when my enemies suffered, or pleased when they met with disaster; 
18Jb 31:30 I never sinned by praying for their death. 
18Jb 31:31 All those who work for me know that I have always welcomed strangers. 
18Jb 31:32 I invited travelers into my home and never let them sleep in the streets. 
18Jb 31:33 Others try to hide their sins, but I have never concealed mine. 
18Jb 31:34 I have never feared what people would say; I have never kept quiet or stayed indoors because I feared their scorn. 
18Jb 31:35 Will no one listen to what I am saying? I swear that every word is true. Let Almighty God answer me. If the charges my opponent brings against me were written down so that I could see them, 
18Jb 31:36 I would wear them proudly on my shoulder and place them on my head like a crown. 
18Jb 31:37 I would tell God everything I have done, and hold my head high in his presence. 
18Jb 31:38 If I have stolen the land I farm and taken it from its rightful owners - 
18Jb 31:39 if I have eaten the food that grew there but let the farmers that grew it starve - 
18Jb 31:40 then instead of wheat and barley, may weeds and thistles grow. The words of Job are ended. 
18Jb 32:1 Because Job was convinced of his own innocence, the three men gave up trying to answer him. 
18Jb 32:2 But a bystander named Elihu could not control his anger any longer, because Job was justifying himself and blaming God. (Elihu was the son of Barakel, a descendant of Buz, and belonged to the clan of Ram.) 
18Jb 32:3 He was also angry with Job's three friends. They could not find any way to answer Job, and this made it appear that God was in the wrong. 
18Jb 32:4 Because Elihu was the youngest one there, he had waited until everyone finished speaking. 
18Jb 32:5 When he saw that the three men could not answer Job, he was angry 
18Jb 32:6 and began to speak. I am young, and you are old, so I was afraid to tell you what I think. 
18Jb 32:7 I told myself that you ought to speak, that you older men should share your wisdom. 
18Jb 32:8 But it is the spirit of Almighty God that comes to us and gives us wisdom. 
18Jb 32:9 It is not growing old that makes us wise or helps us to know what is right. 
18Jb 32:10 So now I want you to listen to me; let me tell you what I think. 
18Jb 32:11 I listened patiently while you were speaking and waited while you searched for wise phrases. 
18Jb 32:12 I paid close attention and heard you fail; you have not disproved what Job has said. 
18Jb 32:13 How can you claim you have discovered wisdom? God must answer Job, for you have failed. 
18Jb 32:14 Job was speaking to you, not to me, but I would never answer the way you did. 
18Jb 32:15 Words have failed them, Job; they have no answer for you. 
18Jb 32:16 Shall I go on waiting when they are silent? They stand there with nothing more to say. 
18Jb 32:17 No, I will give my own answer now and tell you what I think. 
18Jb 32:18 I can hardly wait to speak. I can't hold back the words. 
18Jb 32:19 If I don't get a chance to speak, I will burst like a wineskin full of new wine. 
18Jb 32:20 I can't stand it; I have to speak. 
18Jb 32:21 I will not take sides in this debate; I am not going to flatter anyone. 
18Jb 32:22 I don't know how to flatter, and God would quickly punish me if I did. 
18Jb 33:1 And now, Job, listen carefully to all that I have to say. 
18Jb 33:2 I am ready to say what's on my mind. 
18Jb 33:3 All my words are sincere, and I am speaking the truth. 
18Jb 33:4 God's spirit made me and gave me life. 
18Jb 33:5 Answer me if you can. Prepare your arguments. 
18Jb 33:6 You and I are the same in God's sight, both of us were formed from clay. 
18Jb 33:7 So you have no reason to fear me; I will not overpower you. 
18Jb 33:8 Now this is what I heard you say�� 
18Jb 33:9 "I am not guilty; I have done nothing wrong. I am innocent and free from sin. 
18Jb 33:10 But God finds excuses for attacking me and treats me like an enemy. 
18Jb 33:11 He binds chains on my feet; he watches every move I make." 
18Jb 33:12 But I tell you, Job, you are wrong. God is greater than any human being. 
18Jb 33:13 Why do you accuse God of never answering our complaints? 
18Jb 33:14 Although God speaks again and again, no one pays attention to what he says. 
18Jb 33:15 At night when people are asleep, God speaks in dreams and visions. 
18Jb 33:16 He makes them listen to what he says, and they are frightened at his warnings. 
18Jb 33:17 God speaks to make them stop their sinning and to save them from becoming proud. 
18Jb 33:18 He will not let them be destroyed; he saves them from death itself. 
18Jb 33:19 God corrects us by sending sickness and filling our bodies with pain. 
18Jb 33:20 Those who are sick lose their appetites, and even the finest food looks revolting. 
18Jb 33:21 Their bodies waste away to nothing; you can see all their bones; 
18Jb 33:22 they are about to go to the world of the dead. 
18Jb 33:23 Perhaps an angel may come to their aid - one of God's thousands of angels, who remind us of our duty. 
18Jb 33:24 In mercy the angel will say, "Release them! They are not to go down to the world of the dead. Here is the ransom to set them free." 
18Jb 33:25 Their bodies will grow young and strong again; 
18Jb 33:26 when they pray, God will answer; they will worship God with joy; God will set things right for them again. 
18Jb 33:27 Each one will say in public, "I have sinned. I have not done right, but God spared me. 
18Jb 33:28 He kept me from going to the world of the dead, and I am still alive." 
18Jb 33:29 God does all this again and again; 
18Jb 33:30 each one saves a person's life, and gives him the joy of living. 
18Jb 33:31 Now, Job, listen to what I am saying; be quiet and let me speak. 
18Jb 33:32 But if you have something to say, let me hear it; I would gladly admit you are in the right. 
18Jb 33:33 But if not, be quiet and listen to me, and I will teach you how to be wise. 
18Jb 34:1 You men are so wise, so clever; 
18Jb 34:2 listen now to what I am saying. 
18Jb 34:3 You know good food when you taste it, but not wise words when you hear them. 
18Jb 34:4 It is up to us to decide the case. 
18Jb 34:5 Job claims that he is innocent, that God refuses to give him justice. 
18Jb 34:6 He asks, "How could I lie and say I am wrong? I am fatally wounded, but I am sinless." 
18Jb 34:7 Have you ever seen anyone like this man Job? He never shows respect for God. 
18Jb 34:8 He likes the company of evil people and goes around with sinners. 
18Jb 34:9 He says that it never does any good to try to follow God's will. 
18Jb 34:10 Listen to me, you men who understand! Will Almighty God do what is wrong? 
18Jb 34:11 He rewards people for what they do and treats them as they deserve. 
18Jb 34:12 Almighty God does not do evil; he is never unjust to anyone. 
18Jb 34:13 Did God get his power from someone else? Did someone put him in charge of the world? 
18Jb 34:14 If God took back the breath of life, 
18Jb 34:15 then everyone living would die and turn into dust again. 
18Jb 34:16 Now listen to me, if you are wise. 
18Jb 34:17 Are you condemning the righteous God? Do you think that {\I he hates justice?
18Jb 34:18 God condemns kings and rulers when they are worthless or wicked. 
18Jb 34:19 He does not take the side of rulers nor favor the rich over the poor, for he created everyone. 
18Jb 34:20 We may suddenly die at night. God strikes us down and we perish; he kills the mighty with no effort at all. 
18Jb 34:21 He watches every step we take. 
18Jb 34:22 There is no darkness dark enough to hide a sinner from God. 
18Jb 34:23 God does not need to set a time for us to go and be judged by him. 
18Jb 34:24 He does not need an investigation to remove leaders and replace them with others. 
18Jb 34:25 Because he knows what they do; he overthrows them and crushes them by night. 
18Jb 34:26 He punishes sinners where all can see it, 
18Jb 34:27 because they have stopped following him and ignored all his commands. 
18Jb 34:28 They forced the poor to cry out to God, and he heard their calls for help. 
18Jb 34:29 If God decided to do nothing at all, no one could criticize him. If he hid his face, we would be helpless. 
18Jb 34:30 There would be nothing that nations could do to keep godless oppressors from ruling them. 
18Jb 34:31 Job, have you confessed your sins to God and promised not to sin again? 
18Jb 34:32 Have you asked God to show you your faults, and have you agreed to stop doing evil? 
18Jb 34:33 Since you object to what God does, can you expect him to do what you want? The decision is yours, not mine; tell us now what you think. 
18Jb 34:34 Any sensible person will surely agree; and the wise who hear me will say 
18Jb 34:35 that Job is speaking from ignorance and that nothing he says makes sense. 
18Jb 34:36 Think through everything that Job says; you will see that he talks like an evil man. 
18Jb 34:37 To his sins he adds rebellion; in front of us all he mocks God. 
18Jb 35:1 It is not right, Job, 
18Jb 35:2 for you to say that you are innocent in God's sight, 
18Jb 35:3 or to ask God, "How does my sin affect you? What have I gained by not sinning?" 
18Jb 35:4 I am going to answer you and your friends too. 
18Jb 35:5 Look at the sky! See how high the clouds are! 
18Jb 35:6 If you sin, that does no harm to God. If you do wrong many times, does that affect him? 
18Jb 35:7 Do you help God by being so righteous? There is nothing God needs from you. 
18Jb 35:8 Others suffer from your sins, and the good you do helps them. 
18Jb 35:9 When people are oppressed, they groan; they cry for someone to save them. 
18Jb 35:10 But they don't turn to God, their Creator, who gives them hope in their darkest hours. 
18Jb 35:11 They don't turn to God, who makes us wise, wiser than any animal or bird. 
18Jb 35:12 They cry for help, but God doesn't answer, for they are proud and evil. 
18Jb 35:13 It is useless for them to cry out; Almighty God does not see or hear them. 
18Jb 35:14 Job, you say you can't see God; but wait patiently - your case is before him. 
18Jb 35:15 You think that God does not punish, that he pays little attention to sin. 
18Jb 35:16 It is useless for you to go on talking; it is clear you don't know what you are saying. 
18Jb 36:1 Be patient and listen a little longer to 
18Jb 36:2 what I am saying on God's behalf. 
18Jb 36:3 My knowledge is wide; I will use what I know to show that God, my Creator, is just. 
18Jb 36:4 Nothing I say to you is false; you see before you a truly wise man. 
18Jb 36:5 How strong God is! He despises no one; there is nothing he doesn't understand. 
18Jb 36:6 He does not let sinners live on, and he always treats the poor with justice. 
18Jb 36:7 He protects those who are righteous; he allows them to rule like kings and lets them be honored forever. 
18Jb 36:8 But if people are bound in chains, suffering for what they have done, 
18Jb 36:9 God shows them their sins and their pride. 
18Jb 36:10 He makes them listen to his warning to turn away from evil. 
18Jb 36:11 If they obey God and serve him, they live out their lives in peace and prosperity. 
18Jb 36:12 But if not, they will die in ignorance and cross the stream into the world of the dead. 
18Jb 36:13 Those who are godless keep on being angry, and even when punished, they don't pray for help. 
18Jb 36:14 They die while they are still young, worn out by a life of disgrace. 
18Jb 36:15 But God teaches people through suffering and uses distress to open their eyes. 
18Jb 36:16 God brought you out of trouble, and let you enjoy security; your table was piled high with food. 
18Jb 36:17 But now you are being punished as you deserve. 
18Jb 36:18 Be careful not to let bribes deceive you, or riches lead you astray. 
18Jb 36:19 It will do you no good to cry out for help; all your strength can't help you now. 
18Jb 36:20 Don't wish for night to come, the time when nations will perish. 
18Jb 36:21 Be careful not to turn to evil; your suffering was sent to keep you from it. 
18Jb 36:22 Remember how great is God's power; he is the greatest teacher of all. 
18Jb 36:23 No one can tell God what to do or accuse him of doing evil. 
18Jb 36:24 He has always been praised for what he does; you also must praise him. 
18Jb 36:25 Everyone has seen what he has done; but we can only watch from a distance. 
18Jb 36:26 We cannot fully know his greatness or count the number of his years. 
18Jb 36:27 It is God who takes water from the earth and turns it into drops of rain. 
18Jb 36:28 He lets the rain pour from the clouds in showers for all human beings. 
18Jb 36:29 No one knows how the clouds move or how the thunder roars through the sky, where God dwells. 
18Jb 36:30 He sends lightning through all the sky, but the depths of the sea remain dark. 
18Jb 36:31 This is how he feeds the people and provides an abundance of food. 
18Jb 36:32 He seizes the lightning with his hands and commands it to hit the mark. 
18Jb 36:33 Thunder announces the approaching storm, and the cattle know it is coming. 
18Jb 37:1 The storm makes my heart beat wildly. 
18Jb 37:2 Listen, all of you, to the voice of God, to the thunder that comes from his mouth. 
18Jb 37:3 He sends the lightning across the sky, from one end of the earth to the other. 
18Jb 37:4 Then the roar of his voice is heard, the majestic sound of thunder, and all the while the lightning flashes. 
18Jb 37:5 At God's command amazing things happen, wonderful things that we can't understand. 
18Jb 37:6 He commands snow to fall on the earth, and sends torrents of drenching rain. 
18Jb 37:7 He brings our work to a stop; he shows us what he can do. 
18Jb 37:8 The wild animals go to their dens. 
18Jb 37:9 The storm winds come from the south, and the biting cold from the north. 
18Jb 37:10 The breath of God freezes the waters, and turns them to solid ice. 
18Jb 37:11 Lightning flashes from the clouds, 
18Jb 37:12 as they move at God's will. They do all that God commands, everywhere throughout the world. 
18Jb 37:13 God sends rain to water the earth; he may send it to punish us, or to show us his favor. 
18Jb 37:14 Pause a moment, Job, and listen; consider the wonderful things God does. 
18Jb 37:15 Do you know how God gives the command and makes lightning flash from the clouds? 
18Jb 37:16 Do you know how clouds float in the sky, the work of God's amazing skill? 
18Jb 37:17 No, you can only suffer in the heat when the south wind oppresses the land. 
18Jb 37:18 Can you help God stretch out the sky and make it as hard as polished metal? 
18Jb 37:19 Teach us what to say to God; our minds are blank; we have nothing to say. 
18Jb 37:20 I won't ask to speak with God; why should I give him a chance to destroy me? 
18Jb 37:21 And now the light in the sky is dazzling, too bright for us to look at it; and the sky has been swept clean by the wind. 
18Jb 37:22 A golden glow is seen in the north, and the glory of God fills us with awe. 
18Jb 37:23 God's power is so great that we cannot come near him; he is righteous and just in his dealings with us. 
18Jb 37:24 No wonder, then, that everyone is awed by him, and that he ignores those who claim to be wise. 
18Jb 38:1 Then out of the storm the LORD spoke to Job. 
18Jb 38:2 Who are you to question my wisdom with your ignorant, empty words? 
18Jb 38:3 Now stand up straight and answer the questions I ask you. 
18Jb 38:4 Were you there when I made the world? If you know so much, tell me about it. 
18Jb 38:5 Who decided how large it would be? Who stretched the measuring line over it? Do you know all the answers? 
18Jb 38:6 What holds up the pillars that support the earth? Who laid the cornerstone of the world? 
18Jb 38:7 In the dawn of that day the stars sang together, and the heavenly beings shouted for joy. 
18Jb 38:8 Who closed the gates to hold back the sea when it burst from the womb of the earth? 
18Jb 38:9 It was I who covered the sea with clouds and wrapped it in darkness. 
18Jb 38:10 I marked a boundary for the sea and kept it behind bolted gates. 
18Jb 38:11 I told it, "So far and no farther! Here your powerful waves must stop." 
18Jb 38:12 Job, have you ever in all your life commanded a day to dawn? 
18Jb 38:13 Have you ordered the dawn to seize the earth and shake the wicked from their hiding places? 
18Jb 38:14 Daylight makes the hills and valleys stand out like the folds of a garment, clear as the imprint of a seal on clay. 
18Jb 38:15 The light of day is too bright for the wicked and restrains them from doing violence. 
18Jb 38:16 Have you been to the springs in the depths of the sea? Have you walked on the floor of the ocean? 
18Jb 38:17 Has anyone ever shown you the gates that guard the dark world of the dead? 
18Jb 38:18 Have you any idea how big the world is? Answer me if you know. 
18Jb 38:19 Do you know where the light comes from or what the source of darkness is? 
18Jb 38:20 Can you show them how far to go, or send them back again? 
18Jb 38:21 I am sure you can, because you're so old and were there when the world was made! 
18Jb 38:22 Have you ever visited the storerooms, where I keep the snow and the hail? 
18Jb 38:23 I keep them ready for times of trouble, for days of battle and war. 
18Jb 38:24 Have you been to the place where the sun comes up, or the place from which the east wind blows? 
18Jb 38:25 Who dug a channel for the pouring rain and cleared the way for the thunderstorm? 
18Jb 38:26 Who makes rain fall where no one lives? 
18Jb 38:27 Who waters the dry and thirsty land, so that grass springs up? 
18Jb 38:28 Does either the rain or the dew have a father? 
18Jb 38:29 Who is the mother of the ice and the frost, 
18Jb 38:30 which turn the waters to stone and freeze the face of the sea? 
18Jb 38:31 Can you tie the Pleiades together or loosen the bonds that hold Orion? 
18Jb 38:32 Can you guide the stars season by season and direct the Big and the Little Dipper? 
18Jb 38:33 Do you know the laws that govern the skies, and can you make them apply to the earth? 
18Jb 38:34 Can you shout orders to the clouds and make them drench you with rain? 
18Jb 38:35 And if you command the lightning to flash, will it come to you and say, "At your service"? 
18Jb 38:36 Who tells the ibis when the Nile will flood, or who tells the rooster that rain will fall? 
18Jb 38:37 Who is wise enough to count the clouds and tilt them over to pour out the rain, 
18Jb 38:38 rain that hardens the dust into lumps? 
18Jb 38:39 Do you find food for lions to eat, and satisfy hungry young lions 
18Jb 38:40 when they hide in their caves, or lie in wait in their dens? 
18Jb 38:41 Who is it that feeds the ravens when they wander about hungry, when their young cry to me for food? 
18Jb 39:1 Do you know when mountain goats are born? Have you watched wild deer give birth? 
18Jb 39:2 Do you know how long they carry their young? Do you know the time for their birth? 
18Jb 39:3 Do you know when they will crouch down and bring their young into the world? 
18Jb 39:4 In the wilds their young grow strong; they go away and don't come back. 
18Jb 39:5 Who gave the wild donkeys their freedom? Who turned them loose and let them roam? 
18Jb 39:6 I gave them the desert to be their home, and let them live on the salt plains. 
18Jb 39:7 They keep far away from the noisy cities, and no one can tame them and make them work. 
18Jb 39:8 The mountains are the pastures where they feed, where they search for anything green to eat. 
18Jb 39:9 Will a wild ox work for you? Is he willing to spend the night in your stable? 
18Jb 39:10 Can you hold one with a rope and make him plow? Or make him pull a harrow in your fields? 
18Jb 39:11 Can you rely on his great strength and expect him to do your heavy work? 
18Jb 39:12 Do you expect him to bring in your harvest and gather the grain from your threshing place? 
18Jb 39:13 How fast the wings of an ostrich beat! But no ostrich can fly like a stork. 
18Jb 39:14 The ostrich leaves her eggs on the ground for the heat in the soil to warm them. 
18Jb 39:15 She is unaware that a foot may crush them or a wild animal break them. 
18Jb 39:16 She acts as if the eggs were not hers, and is unconcerned that her efforts were wasted. 
18Jb 39:17 It was I who made her foolish and did not give her wisdom. 
18Jb 39:18 But when she begins to run, she can laugh at any horse and rider. 
18Jb 39:19 Was it you, Job, who made horses so strong and gave them their flowing manes? 
18Jb 39:20 Did you make them leap like locusts and frighten people with their snorting? 
18Jb 39:21 They eagerly paw the ground in the valley; they rush into battle with all their strength. 
18Jb 39:22 They do not know the meaning of fear, and no sword can turn them back. 
18Jb 39:23 The weapons which their riders carry rattle and flash in the sun. 
18Jb 39:24 Trembling with excitement, the horses race ahead; when the trumpet blows, they can't stand still. 
18Jb 39:25 At each blast of the trumpet they snort; they can smell a battle before they get near, and they hear the officers shouting commands. 
18Jb 39:26 Does a hawk learn from you how to fly when it spreads its wings toward the south? 
18Jb 39:27 Does an eagle wait for your command to build its nest high in the mountains? 
18Jb 39:28 It makes its home on the highest rocks and makes the sharp peaks its fortress. 
18Jb 39:29 From there it watches near and far for something to kill and eat. 
18Jb 39:30 Around dead bodies the eagles gather, and the young eagles drink the blood. 
18Jb 40:1 Job, you challenged Almighty God; 
18Jb 40:2 will you give up now, or will you answer? 
18Jb 40:3 I spoke foolishly, LORD. What can I answer? 
18Jb 40:4 I will not try to say anything else. 
18Jb 40:5 I have already said more than I should. 
18Jb 40:6 Then out of the storm the LORD spoke to Job once again. 
18Jb 40:7 Now stand up straight and answer my questions. 
18Jb 40:8 Are you trying to prove that I am unjust - to put me in the wrong and yourself in the right? 
18Jb 40:9 Are you as strong as I am? Can your voice thunder as loud as mine? 
18Jb 40:10 If so, stand up in your honor and pride; clothe yourself with majesty and glory. 
18Jb 40:11 Look at those who are proud; pour out your anger and humble them. 
18Jb 40:12 Yes, look at them and bring them down; crush the wicked where they stand. 
18Jb 40:13 Bury them all in the ground; bind them in the world of the dead. 
18Jb 40:14 Then I will be the first to praise you and admit that you won the victory yourself. 
18Jb 40:15 Look at the monster Behemoth; I created him and I created you. He eats grass like a cow, 
18Jb 40:16 but what strength there is in his body, and what power there is in his muscles! 
18Jb 40:17 His tail stands up like a cedar, and the muscles in his legs are strong. 
18Jb 40:18 His bones are as strong as bronze, and his legs are like iron bars. 
18Jb 40:19 The most amazing of all my creatures! Only his Creator can defeat him. 
18Jb 40:20 Grass to feed him grows on the hills where wild beasts play. 
18Jb 40:21 He lies down under the thorn bushes, and hides among the reeds in the swamp. 
18Jb 40:22 The thorn bushes and the willows by the stream give him shelter in their shade. 
18Jb 40:23 He is not afraid of a rushing river; he is calm when the Jordan dashes in his face. 
18Jb 40:24 Who can blind his eyes and capture him? Or who can catch his snout in a trap? 
18Jb 41:1 Can you catch Leviathan with a fishhook or tie his tongue down with a rope? 
18Jb 41:2 Can you put a rope through his snout or put a hook through his jaws? 
18Jb 41:3 Will he beg you to let him go? Will he plead with you for mercy? 
18Jb 41:4 Will he make an agreement with you and promise to serve you forever? 
18Jb 41:5 Will you tie him like a pet bird, like something to amuse your servant women? 
18Jb 41:6 Will fishermen bargain over him? Will merchants cut him up to sell? 
18Jb 41:7 Can you fill his hide with fishing spears or pierce his head with a harpoon? 
18Jb 41:8 Touch him once and you'll never try it again; you'll never forget the fight! 
18Jb 41:9 Anyone who sees Leviathan loses courage and falls to the ground. 
18Jb 41:10 When he is aroused, he is fierce; no one would dare to stand before him. 
18Jb 41:11 Who can attack him and still be safe? No one in all the world can do it. 
18Jb 41:12 Let me tell you about Leviathan's legs and describe how great and strong he is. 
18Jb 41:13 No one can tear off his outer coat or pierce the armor he wears. 
18Jb 41:14 Who can make him open his jaws, ringed with those terrifying teeth? 
18Jb 41:15 His back is made of rows of shields, fastened together and hard as stone. 
18Jb 41:16 Each one is joined so tight to the next, not even a breath can come between. 
18Jb 41:17 They all are fastened so firmly together that nothing can ever pull them apart. 
18Jb 41:18 Light flashes when he sneezes, and his eyes glow like the rising sun. 
18Jb 41:19 Flames blaze from his mouth, and streams of sparks fly out. 
18Jb 41:20 Smoke comes pouring out of his nose, like smoke from weeds burning under a pot. 
18Jb 41:21 His breath starts fires burning; flames leap out of his mouth. 
18Jb 41:22 His neck is so powerful that all who meet him are terrified. 
18Jb 41:23 There is not a weak spot in his skin; it is as hard and unyielding as iron. 
18Jb 41:24 His stony heart is without fear, as unyielding and hard as a millstone. 
18Jb 41:25 When he rises up, even the strongest are frightened; they are helpless with fear. 
18Jb 41:26 There is no sword that can wound him; no spear or arrow or lance that can harm him. 
18Jb 41:27 For him iron is as flimsy as straw, and bronze as soft as rotten wood. 
18Jb 41:28 There is no arrow that can make him run; rocks thrown at him are like bits of straw. 
18Jb 41:29 To him a club is a piece of straw, and he laughs when men throw spears. 
18Jb 41:30 The scales on his belly are like jagged pieces of pottery; they tear up the muddy ground like a threshing sledge. 
18Jb 41:31 He churns up the sea like boiling water and makes it bubble like a pot of oil. 
18Jb 41:32 He leaves a shining path behind him and turns the sea to white foam. 
18Jb 41:33 There is nothing on earth to compare with him; he is a creature that has no fear. 
18Jb 41:34 He looks down on even the proudest animals; he is king of all wild beasts. 
18Jb 42:1 Then Job answered the LORD. 
18Jb 42:2 I know, LORD, that you are all-powerful; that you can do everything you want. 
18Jb 42:3 You ask how I dare question your wisdom when I am so very ignorant. I talked about things I did not understand, about marvels too great for me to know. 
18Jb 42:4 You told me to listen while you spoke and to try to answer your questions. 
18Jb 42:5 In the past I knew only what others had told me, but now I have seen you with my own eyes. 
18Jb 42:6 So I am ashamed of all I have said and repent in dust and ashes. 
18Jb 42:7 After the LORD had finished speaking to Job, he said to Eliphaz, "I am angry with you and your two friends, because you did not speak the truth about me, the way my servant Job did. 
18Jb 42:8 Now take seven bulls and seven rams to Job and offer them as a sacrifice for yourselves. Job will pray for you, and I will answer his prayer and not disgrace you the way you deserve. You did not speak the truth about me as he did." 
18Jb 42:9 Eliphaz, Bildad, and Zophar did what the LORD had told them to do, and the LORD answered Job's prayer. 
18Jb 42:10 Then, after Job had prayed for his three friends, the LORD made him prosperous again and gave him twice as much as he had had before. 
18Jb 42:11 All Job's brothers and sisters and former friends came to visit him and feasted with him in his house. They expressed their sympathy and comforted him for all the troubles the LORD had brought on him. Each of them gave him some money and a gold ring. 
18Jb 42:12 The LORD blessed the last part of Job's life even more than he had blessed the first. Job owned fourteen thousand sheep, six thousand camels, two thousand head of cattle, and one thousand donkeys. 
18Jb 42:13 He was the father of seven sons and three daughters. 
18Jb 42:14 He called the oldest daughter Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the youngest Keren Happuch. 
18Jb 42:15 There were no other women in the whole world as beautiful as Job's daughters. Their father gave them a share of the inheritance along with their brothers. 
18Jb 42:16 Job lived a hundred and forty years after this, long enough to see his grandchildren and great-grandchildren. 
18Jb 42:17 And then he died at a very great age.

19Ps 1:1 Happy are those who reject the advice of evil people, who do not follow the example of sinners or join those who have no use for God. 
19Ps 1:2 Instead, they find joy in obeying the Law of the LORD, and they study it day and night. 
19Ps 1:3 They are like trees that grow beside a stream, that bear fruit at the right time, and whose leaves do not dry up. They succeed in everything they do. 
19Ps 1:4 But evil people are not like this at all; they are like straw that the wind blows away. 
19Ps 1:5 Sinners will be condemned by God and kept apart from God's own people. 
19Ps 1:6 The righteous are guided and protected by the LORD, but the evil are on the way to their doom. 
19Ps 2:1 Why do the nations plan rebellion? Why do people make their useless plots? 
19Ps 2:2 Their kings revolt, their rulers plot together against the LORD and against the king he chose. 
19Ps 2:3 "Let us free ourselves from their rule," they say; "let us throw off their control." 
19Ps 2:4 From his throne in heaven the Lord laughs and mocks their feeble plans. 
19Ps 2:5 Then he warns them in anger and terrifies them with his fury. 
19Ps 2:6 "On Zion, my sacred hill," he says, "I have installed my king." 
19Ps 2:7 "I will announce," says the king, "what the LORD has declared. He said to me�� 'You are my son; today I have become your father. 
19Ps 2:8 Ask, and I will give you all the nations; the whole earth will be yours. 
19Ps 2:9 You will break them with an iron rod; you will shatter them in pieces like a clay pot.' " 
19Ps 2:10 Now listen to this warning, you kings; learn this lesson, you rulers of the world�� 
19Ps 2:11 Serve the LORD with fear; tremble 
19Ps 2:12 and bow down to him; or else his anger will be quickly aroused, and you will suddenly die. Happy are all who go to him for protection. 
19Ps 3:1 I have so many enemies, LORD, so many who turn against me! 
19Ps 3:2 They talk about me and say, "God will not help him." 
19Ps 3:3 But you, O LORD, are always my shield from danger; you give me victory and restore my courage. 
19Ps 3:4 I call to the LORD for help, and from his sacred hill he answers me. 
19Ps 3:5 I lie down and sleep, and all night long the LORD protects me. 
19Ps 3:6 I am not afraid of the thousands of enemies who surround me on every side. 
19Ps 3:7 Come, LORD! Save me, my God! You punish all my enemies and leave them powerless to harm me. 
19Ps 3:8 Victory comes from the LORD - may he bless his people. 
19Ps 4:1 Answer me when I pray, O God, my defender! When I was in trouble, you helped me. Be kind to me now and hear my prayer. 
19Ps 4:2 How long will you people insult me? How long will you love what is worthless and go after what is false? 
19Ps 4:3 Remember that the LORD has chosen the righteous for his own, and he hears me when I call to him. 
19Ps 4:4 Tremble with fear and stop sinning; think deeply about this, when you lie in silence on your beds. 
19Ps 4:5 Offer the right sacrifices to the LORD, and put your trust in him. 
19Ps 4:6 There are many who pray�� "Give us more blessings, O LORD. Look on us with kindness!" 
19Ps 4:7 But the joy that you have given me is more than they will ever have with all their grain and wine. 
19Ps 4:8 When I lie down, I go to sleep in peace; you alone, O LORD, keep me perfectly safe. 
19Ps 5:1 Listen to my words, O LORD, and hear my sighs. 
19Ps 5:2 Listen to my cry for help, my God and king! I pray to you, O LORD; 
19Ps 5:3 you hear my voice in the morning; at sunrise I offer my prayer and wait for your answer. 
19Ps 5:4 You are not a God who is pleased with wrongdoing; you allow no evil in your presence. 
19Ps 5:5 You cannot stand the sight of the proud; you hate all wicked people. 
19Ps 5:6 You destroy all liars and despise violent, deceitful people. 
19Ps 5:7 But because of your great love I can come into your house; I can worship in your holy Temple and bow down to you in reverence. 
19Ps 5:8 LORD, I have so many enemies! Lead me to do your will; make your way plain for me to follow. 
19Ps 5:9 What my enemies say can never be trusted; they only want to destroy. Their words are flattering and smooth, but full of deadly deceit. 
19Ps 5:10 Condemn and punish them, O God; may their own plots cause their ruin. Drive them out of your presence because of their many sins and their rebellion against you. 
19Ps 5:11 But all who find safety in you will rejoice; they can always sing for joy. Protect those who love you; because of you they are truly happy. 
19Ps 5:12 You bless those who obey you, LORD; your love protects them like a shield. 
19Ps 6:1 LORD, don't be angry and rebuke me! Don't punish me in your anger! 
19Ps 6:2 I am worn out, O LORD; have pity on me! Give me strength; I am completely exhausted 
19Ps 6:3 and my whole being is deeply troubled. How long, O LORD, will you wait to help me? 
19Ps 6:4 Come and save me, LORD; in your mercy rescue me from death. 
19Ps 6:5 In the world of the dead you are not remembered; no one can praise you there. 
19Ps 6:6 I am worn out with grief; every night my bed is damp from my weeping; my pillow is soaked with tears. 
19Ps 6:7 I can hardly see; my eyes are so swollen from the weeping caused by my enemies. 
19Ps 6:8 Keep away from me, you evil people! The LORD hears my weeping; 
19Ps 6:9 he listens to my cry for help and will answer my prayer. 
19Ps 6:10 My enemies will know the bitter shame of defeat; in sudden confusion they will be driven away. 
19Ps 7:1 O LORD, my God, I come to you for protection; rescue me and save me from all who pursue me, 
19Ps 7:2 or else like a lion they will carry me off where no one can save me, and there they will tear me to pieces. 
19Ps 7:3 O LORD, my God, if I have wronged anyone, if I have betrayed a friend or without cause done violence to my enemy - 
19Ps 7:4 if I have done any of these things - 
19Ps 7:5 then let my enemies pursue me and catch me, let them cut me down and kill me and leave me lifeless on the ground! 
19Ps 7:6 Rise in your anger, O LORD! Stand up against the fury of my enemies; rouse yourself and help me! Justice is what you demand, 
19Ps 7:7 so bring together all the peoples around you, and rule over them from above. 
19Ps 7:8 You are the judge of all people. Judge in my favor, O LORD; you know that I am innocent. 
19Ps 7:9 You are a righteous God and judge our thoughts and desires. Stop the wickedness of evildoers and reward those who are good. 
19Ps 7:10 God is my protector; he saves those who obey him. 
19Ps 7:11 God is a righteous judge and always condemns the wicked. 
19Ps 7:12 If they do not change their ways, God will sharpen his sword. He bends his bow and makes it ready; 
19Ps 7:13 he takes up his deadly weapons and aims his burning arrows. 
19Ps 7:14 See how wicked people think up evil; they plan trouble and practice deception. 
19Ps 7:15 But in the traps they set for others, they themselves get caught. 
19Ps 7:16 So they are punished by their own evil and are hurt by their own violence. 
19Ps 7:17 I thank the LORD for his justice; I sing praises to the LORD, the Most High. 
19Ps 8:1 O LORD,our Lord, your greatness is seen in all the world! Your praise reaches up to the heavens; 
19Ps 8:2 it is sung by children and babies. You are safe and secure from all your enemies; you stop anyone who opposes you. 
19Ps 8:3 When I look at the sky, which you have made, at the moon and the stars, which you set in their places - 
19Ps 8:4 what are human beings, that you think of them; mere mortals, that you care for them? 
19Ps 8:5 Yet you made them inferior only to yourself; you crowned them with glory and honor. 
19Ps 8:6 You appointed them rulers over everything you made; you placed them over all creation�� 
19Ps 8:7 sheep and cattle, and the wild animals too; 
19Ps 8:8 the birds and the fish and the creatures in the seas. 
19Ps 8:9 O LORD, our Lord, your greatness is seen in all the world! 
19Ps 9:1 I will praise you, LORD, with all my heart; I will tell of all the wonderful things you have done. 
19Ps 9:2 I will sing with joy because of you. I will sing praise to you, Almighty God. 
19Ps 9:3 My enemies turn back when you appear; they fall down and die. 
19Ps 9:4 You are fair and honest in your judgments, and you have judged in my favor. 
19Ps 9:5 You have condemned the heathen and destroyed the wicked; they will be remembered no more. 
19Ps 9:6 Our enemies are finished forever; you have destroyed their cities, and they are completely forgotten. 
19Ps 9:7 But the LORD is king forever; he has set up his throne for judgment. 
19Ps 9:8 He rules the world with righteousness; he judges the nations with justice. 
19Ps 9:9 The LORD is a refuge for the oppressed, a place of safety in times of trouble. 
19Ps 9:10 Those who know you, LORD, will trust you; you do not abandon anyone who comes to you. 
19Ps 9:11 Sing praise to the LORD, who rules in Zion! Tell every nation what he has done! 
19Ps 9:12 God remembers those who suffer; he does not forget their cry, and he punishes those who wrong them. 
19Ps 9:13 Be merciful to me, O LORD! See the sufferings my enemies cause me! Rescue me from death, O LORD, 
19Ps 9:14 that I may stand before the people of Jerusalem and tell them all the things for which I praise you. I will rejoice because you saved me. 
19Ps 9:15 The heathen have dug a pit and fallen in; they have been caught in their own trap. 
19Ps 9:16 The LORD has revealed himself by his righteous judgments, and the wicked are trapped by their own deeds. 
19Ps 9:17 Death is the destiny of all the wicked, of all those who reject God. 
19Ps 9:18 The needy will not always be neglected; the hope of the poor will not be crushed forever. 
19Ps 9:19 Come, LORD! Do not let anyone defy you! Bring the heathen before you and pronounce judgment on them. 
19Ps 9:20 Make them afraid, O LORD; make them know that they are only mortal beings. 
19Ps 10:1 Why are you so far away, O LORD? Why do you hide yourself when we are in trouble? 
19Ps 10:2 The wicked are proud and persecute the poor; catch them in the traps they have made. 
19Ps 10:3 The wicked are proud of their evil desires; the greedy curse and reject the LORD. 
19Ps 10:4 The wicked do not care about the LORD; in their pride they think that God doesn't matter. 
19Ps 10:5 The wicked succeed in everything. They cannot understand God's judgments; they sneer at their enemies. 
19Ps 10:6 They say to themselves, "We will never fail; we will never be in trouble." 
19Ps 10:7 Their speech is filled with curses, lies, and threats; they are quick to speak hateful, evil words. 
19Ps 10:8 They hide themselves in the villages, waiting to murder innocent people. They spy on their helpless victims; 
19Ps 10:9 they wait in their hiding place like lions. They lie in wait for the poor; they catch them in their traps and drag them away. 
19Ps 10:10 The helpless victims lie crushed; brute strength has defeated them. 
19Ps 10:11 The wicked say to themselves, "God doesn't care! He has closed his eyes and will never see me!" 
19Ps 10:12 O LORD, punish those wicked people! Remember those who are suffering! 
19Ps 10:13 How can the wicked despise God and say to themselves, "He will not punish me"? 
19Ps 10:14 But you do see; you take notice of trouble and suffering and are always ready to help. The helpless commit themselves to you; you have always helped the needy. 
19Ps 10:15 Break the power of wicked and evil people; punish them for the wrong they have done until they do it no more. 
19Ps 10:16 The LORD is king forever and ever. Those who worship other gods will vanish from his land. 
19Ps 10:17 You will listen, O LORD, to the prayers of the lowly; you will give them courage. 
19Ps 10:18 You will hear the cries of the oppressed and the orphans; you will judge in their favor, so that mortal men may cause terror no more. 
19Ps 11:1 I trust in the LORD for safety. How foolish of you to say to me, "Fly away like a bird to the mountains, 
19Ps 11:2 because the wicked have drawn their bows and aimed their arrows to shoot from the shadows at good people. 
19Ps 11:3 There is nothing a good person can do when everything falls apart." 
19Ps 11:4 The LORD is in his holy temple; he has his throne in heaven. He watches people everywhere and knows what they are doing. 
19Ps 11:5 He examines the good and the wicked alike; the lawless he hates with all his heart. 
19Ps 11:6 He sends down flaming coals and burning sulfur on the wicked; he punishes them with scorching winds. 
19Ps 11:7 The LORD is righteous and loves good deeds; those who do them will live in his presence. 
19Ps 12:1 Help us, LORD! There is not a good person left; honest people can no longer be found. 
19Ps 12:2 All of them lie to one another; they deceive each other with flattery. 
19Ps 12:3 Silence those flattering tongues, O LORD! Close those boastful mouths that say, 
19Ps 12:4 "With our words we get what we want. We will say what we wish, and no one can stop us." 
19Ps 12:5 "But now I will come," says the LORD, "because the needy are oppressed and the persecuted groan in pain. I will give them the security they long for." 
19Ps 12:6 The promises of the LORD can be trusted; they are as genuine as silver refined seven times in the furnace. 
19Ps 12:7 The wicked are everywhere, and everyone praises what is evil.
19Ps 12:8 Keep us always safe, O LORD, and preserve us from such people. 
19Ps 13:1 How much longer will you forget me, LORD? Forever? How much longer will you hide yourself from me? 
19Ps 13:2 How long must I endure trouble? How long will sorrow fill my heart day and night? How long will my enemies triumph over me? 
19Ps 13:3 Look at me, O LORD my God, and answer me. Restore my strength; don't let me die. 
19Ps 13:4 Don't let my enemies say, "We have defeated him." Don't let them gloat over my downfall. 
19Ps 13:5 I rely on your constant love; I will be glad, because you will rescue me. 
19Ps 13:6 I will sing to you, O LORD, because you have been good to me. 
19Ps 14:1 Fools say to themselves, "There is no God!" They are all corrupt, and they have done terrible things; there is no one who does what is right. 
19Ps 14:2 The LORD looks down from heaven at us humans to see if there are any who are wise, any who worship him. 
19Ps 14:3 But they have all gone wrong; they are all equally bad. Not one of them does what is right, not a single one. 
19Ps 14:4 "Don't they know?" asks the LORD. "Are all these evildoers ignorant? They live by robbing my people, and they never pray to me." 
19Ps 14:5 But then they will be terrified, for God is with those who obey him. 
19Ps 14:6 Evildoers frustrate the plans of the humble, but the LORD is their protection. 
19Ps 14:7 How I pray that victory will come to Israel from Zion. How happy the people of Israel will be when the LORD makes them prosperous again! 
19Ps 15:1 LORD, who may enter your Temple? Who may worship on Zion, your sacred hill? 
19Ps 15:2 Those who obey God in everything and always do what is right, whose words are true and sincere, 
19Ps 15:3 and who do not slander others. They do no wrong to their friends nor spread rumors about their neighbors. 
19Ps 15:4 They despise those whom God rejects, but honor those who obey the LORD. They always do what they promise, no matter how much it may cost. 
19Ps 15:5 They make loans without charging interest and cannot be bribed to testify against the innocent. Whoever does these things will always be secure. 
19Ps 16:1 Protect me, O God; I trust in you for safety. 
19Ps 16:2 I say to the LORD, "You are my Lord; all the good things I have come from you." 
19Ps 16:3 How excellent are the LORD's faithful people! My greatest pleasure is to be with them. 
19Ps 16:4 Those who rush to other gods bring many troubles on themselves. I will not take part in their sacrifices; I will not worship their gods. 
19Ps 16:5 You, LORD, are all I have, and you give me all I need; my future is in your hands. 
19Ps 16:6 How wonderful are your gifts to me; how good they are! 
19Ps 16:7 I praise the LORD, because he guides me, and in the night my conscience warns me. 
19Ps 16:8 I am always aware of the LORD's presence; he is near, and nothing can shake me. 
19Ps 16:9 And so I am thankful and glad, and I feel completely secure, 
19Ps 16:10 because you protect me from the power of death. I have served you faithfully, and you will not abandon me to the world of the dead. 
19Ps 16:11 You will show me the path that leads to life; your presence fills me with joy and brings me pleasure forever. 
19Ps 17:1 Listen, O LORD, to my plea for justice; pay attention to my cry for help! Listen to my honest prayer. 
19Ps 17:2 You will judge in my favor, because you know what is right. 
19Ps 17:3 You know my heart. You have come to me at night; you have examined me completely and found no evil desire in me. I speak no evil, 
19Ps 17:4 as others do; I have obeyed your command and have not followed paths of violence. 
19Ps 17:5 I have always walked in your way and have never strayed from it. 
19Ps 17:6 I pray to you, O God, because you answer me; so turn to me and listen to my words. 
19Ps 17:7 Reveal your wonderful love and save me; at your side I am safe from my enemies. 
19Ps 17:8 Protect me as you would your very eyes; hide me in the shadow of your wings 
19Ps 17:9 from the attacks of the wicked. Deadly enemies surround me; 
19Ps 17:10 they have no pity and speak proudly. 
19Ps 17:11 They are around me now, wherever I turn, watching for a chance to pull me down. 
19Ps 17:12 They are like lions, waiting for me, wanting to tear me to pieces. 
19Ps 17:13 Come, LORD! Oppose my enemies and defeat them! Save me from the wicked by your sword; 
19Ps 17:14 save me from those who in this life have all they want. Punish them with the sufferings you have stored up for them; may there be enough for their children and some left over for their children's children! 
19Ps 17:15 But I will see you, because I have done no wrong; and when I awake, your presence will fill me with joy. 
19Ps 18:1 How I love you, LORD! You are my defender. 
19Ps 18:2 The LORD is my protector; he is my strong fortress. My God is my protection, and with him I am safe. He protects me like a shield; he defends me and keeps me safe. 
19Ps 18:3 I call to the LORD, and he saves me from my enemies. Praise the LORD! 
19Ps 18:4 The danger of death was all around me; the waves of destruction rolled over me. 
19Ps 18:5 The danger of death was around me, and the grave set its trap for me. 
19Ps 18:6 In my trouble I called to the LORD; I called to my God for help. In his temple he heard my voice; he listened to my cry for help. 
19Ps 18:7 Then the earth trembled and shook; the foundations of the mountains rocked and quivered, because God was angry. 
19Ps 18:8 Smoke poured out of his nostrils, a consuming flame and burning coals from his mouth. 
19Ps 18:9 He tore the sky open and came down with a dark cloud under his feet. 
19Ps 18:10 He flew swiftly on his winged creature; he traveled on the wings of the wind. 
19Ps 18:11 He covered himself with darkness; thick clouds, full of water, surrounded him. 
19Ps 18:12 Hailstones and flashes of fire came from the lightning before him and broke through the dark clouds. 
19Ps 18:13 Then the LORD thundered from the sky; and the voice of the Most High was heard. 
19Ps 18:14 He shot his arrows and scattered his enemies; with flashes of lightning he sent them running. 
19Ps 18:15 The floor of the ocean was laid bare, and the foundations of the earth were uncovered, when you rebuked your enemies, LORD, and roared at them in anger. 
19Ps 18:16 The LORD reached down from above and took hold of me; he pulled me out of the deep waters. 
19Ps 18:17 He rescued me from my powerful enemies and from all those who hate me - they were too strong for me. 
19Ps 18:18 When I was in trouble, they attacked me, but the LORD protected me. 
19Ps 18:19 He helped me out of danger; he saved me because he was pleased with me. 
19Ps 18:20 The LORD rewards me because I do what is right; he blesses me because I am innocent. 
19Ps 18:21 I have obeyed the law of the LORD; I have not turned away from my God. 
19Ps 18:22 I have observed all his laws; I have not disobeyed his commands. 
19Ps 18:23 He knows that I am faultless, that I have kept myself from doing wrong. 
19Ps 18:24 And so he rewards me because I do what is right, because he knows that I am innocent. 
19Ps 18:25 O LORD, you are faithful to those who are faithful to you; completely good to those who are perfect. 
19Ps 18:26 You are pure to those who are pure, but hostile to those who are wicked. 
19Ps 18:27 You save those who are humble, but you humble those who are proud. 
19Ps 18:28 O LORD, you give me light; you dispel my darkness. 
19Ps 18:29 You give me strength to attack my enemies and power to overcome their defenses. 
19Ps 18:30 This God - how perfect are his deeds! How dependable his words! He is like a shield for all who seek his protection. 
19Ps 18:31 The LORD alone is God; God alone is our defense. 
19Ps 18:32 He is the God who makes me strong, who makes my pathway safe. 
19Ps 18:33 He makes me sure-footed as a deer; he keeps me safe on the mountains. 
19Ps 18:34 He trains me for battle, so that I can use the strongest bow. 
19Ps 18:35 O LORD, you protect me and save me; your care has made me great, and your power has kept me safe. 
19Ps 18:36 You have kept me from being captured, and I have never fallen. 
19Ps 18:37 I pursue my enemies and catch them; I do not stop until I destroy them. 
19Ps 18:38 I strike them down, and they cannot rise; they lie defeated before me. 
19Ps 18:39 You give me strength for the battle and victory over my enemies. 
19Ps 18:40 You make my enemies run from me; I destroy those who hate me. 
19Ps 18:41 They cry for help, but no one saves them; they call to the LORD, but he does not answer. 
19Ps 18:42 I crush them, so that they become like dust which the wind blows away. I trample on them like mud in the streets. 
19Ps 18:43 You saved me from a rebellious people and made me ruler over the nations; people I did not know have now become my subjects. 
19Ps 18:44 Foreigners bow before me; when they hear me, they obey. 
19Ps 18:45 They lose their courage and come trembling from their fortresses. 
19Ps 18:46 The LORD lives! Praise my defender! Proclaim the greatness of the God who saves me. 
19Ps 18:47 He gives me victory over my enemies; he subdues the nations under me 
19Ps 18:48 and saves me from my foes. O LORD, you give me victory over my enemies and protect me from violent people. 
19Ps 18:49 And so I praise you among the nations; I sing praises to you. 
19Ps 18:50 God gives great victories to his king; he shows constant love to the one he has chosen, to David and his descendants forever. 
19Ps 19:1 How clearly the sky reveals God's glory! How plainly it shows what he has done! 
19Ps 19:2 Each day announces it to the following day; each night repeats it to the next. 
19Ps 19:3 No speech or words are used, no sound is heard; 
19Ps 19:4 yet their message goes out to all the world and is heard to the ends of the earth. God made a home in the sky for the sun; 
19Ps 19:5 it comes out in the morning like a happy bridegroom, like an athlete eager to run a race. 
19Ps 19:6 It starts at one end of the sky and goes across to the other. Nothing can hide from its heat. 
19Ps 19:7 The law of the LORD is perfect; it gives new strength. The commands of the LORD are trustworthy, giving wisdom to those who lack it. 
19Ps 19:8 The laws of the LORD are right, and those who obey them are happy. The commands of the LORD are just and give understanding to the mind. 
19Ps 19:9 Reverence for the LORD is good; it will continue forever. The judgments of the LORD are just; they are always fair. 
19Ps 19:10 They are more desirable than the finest gold; they are sweeter than the purest honey. 
19Ps 19:11 They give knowledge to me, your servant; I am rewarded for obeying them. 
19Ps 19:12 None of us can see our own errors; deliver me, LORD, from hidden faults! 
19Ps 19:13 Keep me safe, also, from willful sins; don't let them rule over me. Then I shall be perfect and free from the evil of sin. 
19Ps 19:14 May my words and my thoughts be acceptable to you, O LORD, my refuge and my redeemer! 
19Ps 20:1 May the LORD answer you when you are in trouble! May the God of Jacob protect you! 
19Ps 20:2 May he send you help from his Temple and give you aid from Mount Zion. 
19Ps 20:3 May he accept all your offerings and be pleased with all your sacrifices. 
19Ps 20:4 May he give you what you desire and make all your plans succeed. 
19Ps 20:5 Then we will shout for joy over your victory and celebrate your triumph by praising our God. May the LORD answer all your requests. 
19Ps 20:6 Now I know that the LORD gives victory to his chosen king; he answers him from his holy heaven and by his power gives him great victories. 
19Ps 20:7 Some trust in their war chariots and others in their horses, but we trust in the power of the LORD our God. 
19Ps 20:8 Such people will stumble and fall, but we will rise and stand firm. 
19Ps 20:9 Give victory to the king, O LORD; answer us when we call. 
19Ps 21:1 The king is glad, O LORD, because you gave him strength; he rejoices because you made him victorious. 
19Ps 21:2 You have given him his heart's desire; you have answered his request. 
19Ps 21:3 You came to him with great blessings and set a crown of gold on his head. 
19Ps 21:4 He asked for life, and you gave it, a long and lasting life. 
19Ps 21:5 His glory is great because of your help; you have given him fame and majesty. 
19Ps 21:6 Your blessings are with him forever, and your presence fills him with joy. 
19Ps 21:7 The king trusts in the LORD Almighty; and because of the LORD's constant love he will always be secure. 
19Ps 21:8 The king will capture all his enemies; he will capture everyone who hates him. 
19Ps 21:9 He will destroy them like a blazing fire when he appears. The LORD will devour them in his anger, and fire will consume them. 
19Ps 21:10 None of their descendants will survive; the king will kill them all. 
19Ps 21:11 They make their plans, and plot against him, but they will not succeed. 
19Ps 21:12 He will shoot his arrows at them and make them turn and run. 
19Ps 21:13 We praise you, LORD, for your great strength! We will sing and praise your power. 
19Ps 22:1 My God, my God, why have you abandoned me? I have cried desperately for help, but still it does not come. 
19Ps 22:2 During the day I call to you, my God, but you do not answer; I call at night, but get no rest. 
19Ps 22:3 But you are enthroned as the Holy One, the one whom Israel praises. 
19Ps 22:4 Our ancestors put their trust in you; they trusted you, and you saved them. 
19Ps 22:5 They called to you and escaped from danger; they trusted you and were not disappointed. 
19Ps 22:6 But I am no longer a human being; I am a worm, despised and scorned by everyone! 
19Ps 22:7 All who see me make fun of me; they stick out their tongues and shake their heads.

19Ps 34:15 The LORD watches over the righteous and listens to their cries; 
19Ps 34:16 but he opposes those who do evil, so that when they die, they are soon forgotten. 
19Ps 34:17 The righteous call to the LORD, and he listens; he rescues them from all their troubles.

19Ps 35:5 May they be like straw blown by the wind as the angel of the LORD pursues them! 
19Ps 35:6 May their path be dark and slippery while the angel of the LORD strikes them down! 
19Ps 35:7 Without any reason they laid a trap for me and dug a deep hole to catch me. 
19Ps 35:8 But destruction will catch them before they know it; they will be caught in their own trap and fall to their destruction! 
19Ps 35:9 Then I will be glad because of the LORD; I will be happy because he saved me. 
19Ps 35:10 With all my heart I will say to the LORD, "There is no one like you. You protect the weak from the strong, the poor from the oppressor." 
19Ps 35:11 Evil people testify against me and accuse me of crimes I know nothing about. 
19Ps 35:12 They pay me back evil for good, and I sink in despair. 
19Ps 35:13 But when they were sick, I dressed in mourning; I deprived myself of food; I prayed with my head bowed low, 
19Ps 35:14 as I would pray for a friend or a brother. I went around bent over in mourning, as one who mourns for his mother. 
19Ps 35:15 But when I was in trouble, they were all glad and gathered around to make fun of me; strangers beat me and kept striking me. 
19Ps 35:16 Like those who would mock a cripple, they glared at me with hate. 
19Ps 35:17 How much longer, Lord, will you just look on? Rescue me from their attacks; save my life from these lions! 
19Ps 35:18 Then I will thank you in the assembly of your people; I will praise you before them all. 
19Ps 35:19 Don't let my enemies, those liars, gloat over my defeat. Don't let those who hate me for no reason smirk with delight over my sorrow. 
19Ps 35:20 They do not speak in a friendly way; instead they invent all kinds of lies about peace-loving people. 
19Ps 35:21 They accuse me, shouting, "We saw what you did!" 
19Ps 35:22 But you, O LORD, have seen this. So don't be silent, Lord; don't keep yourself far away! 
19Ps 35:23 Rouse yourself, O Lord, and defend me; rise up, my God, and plead my cause. 
19Ps 35:24 You are righteous, O LORD, so declare me innocent; don't let my enemies gloat over me. 
19Ps 35:25 Don't let them say to themselves, "We are rid of him! That's just what we wanted!" 
19Ps 35:26 May those who gloat over my suffering be completely defeated and confused; may those who claim to be better than I am be covered with shame and disgrace. 
19Ps 35:27 May those who want to see me acquitted shout for joy and say again and again, "How great is the LORD! He is pleased with the success of his servant." 
19Ps 35:28 Then I will proclaim your righteousness, and I will praise you all day long. 
19Ps 36:1 Sin speaks to the wicked deep in their hearts; they reject God and do not have reverence for him. 
19Ps 36:2 Because they think so highly of themselves, they think that God will not discover their sin and condemn it. 
19Ps 36:3 Their speech is wicked and full of lies; they no longer do what is wise and good. 
19Ps 36:4 They make evil plans as they lie in bed; nothing they do is good, and they never reject anything evil. 
19Ps 36:5 LORD, your constant love reaches the heavens; your faithfulness extends to the skies. 
19Ps 36:6 Your righteousness is towering like the mountains; your justice is like the depths of the sea. People and animals are in your care. 
19Ps 36:7 How precious, O God, is your constant love! We find protection under the shadow of your wings. 
19Ps 36:8 We feast on the abundant food you provide; you let us drink from the river of your goodness. 
19Ps 36:9 You are the source of all life, and because of your light we see the light. 
19Ps 36:10 Continue to love those who know you and to do good to those who are righteous. 
19Ps 36:11 Do not let proud people attack me or the wicked make me run away. 
19Ps 36:12 See where evil people have fallen. There they lie, unable to rise. 
19Ps 37:1 Don't be worried on account of the wicked; don't be jealous of those who do wrong. 
19Ps 37:2 They will soon disappear like grass that dries up; they will die like plants that wither. 
19Ps 37:3 Trust in the LORD and do good; live in the land and be safe. 
19Ps 37:4 Seek your happiness in the LORD, and he will give you your heart's desire. 
19Ps 37:5 Give yourself to the LORD; trust in him, and he will help you; 
19Ps 37:6 he will make your righteousness shine like the noonday sun. 
19Ps 37:7 Be patient and wait for the LORD to act; don't be worried about those who prosper or those who succeed in their evil plans. 
19Ps 37:8 Don't give in to worry or anger; it only leads to trouble. 
19Ps 37:9 Those who trust in the LORD will possess the land, but the wicked will be driven out. 
19Ps 37:10 Soon the wicked will disappear; you may look for them, but you won't find them; 
19Ps 37:11 but the humble will possess the land and enjoy prosperity and peace. 
19Ps 37:12 The wicked plot against good people and glare at them with hate. 
19Ps 37:13 But the Lord laughs at wicked people, because he knows they will soon be destroyed. 
19Ps 37:14 The wicked draw their swords and bend their bows to kill the poor and needy, to slaughter those who do what is right; 
19Ps 37:15 but they will be killed by their own swords, and their bows will be smashed. 
19Ps 37:16 The little that a good person owns is worth more than the wealth of all the wicked, 
19Ps 37:17 because the LORD will take away the strength of the wicked, but protect those who are good. 
19Ps 37:18 The LORD takes care of those who obey him, and the land will be theirs forever. 
19Ps 37:19 They will not suffer when times are bad; they will have enough in time of famine. 
19Ps 37:20 But the wicked will die; the enemies of the LORD will vanish like wild flowers; they will disappear like smoke. 
19Ps 37:21 The wicked borrow and never pay back, but good people are generous with their gifts. 
19Ps 37:22 Those who are blessed by the LORD will possess the land, but those who are cursed by him will be driven out. 
19Ps 37:23 The LORD guides us in the way we should go and protects those who please him. 
19Ps 37:24 If they fall, they will not stay down, because the LORD will help them up. 
19Ps 37:25 I am old now; I have lived a long time, but I have never seen good people abandoned by the LORD or their children begging for food. 
19Ps 37:26 At all times they give freely and lend to others, and their children are a blessing. 
19Ps 37:27 Turn away from evil and do good, and your descendants will always live in the land; 
19Ps 37:28 for the LORD loves what is right and does not abandon his faithful people. He protects them forever, but the descendants of the wicked will be driven out. 
19Ps 37:29 The righteous will possess the land and live in it forever. 
19Ps 37:30 The words of good people are wise, and they are always fair. 
19Ps 37:31 They keep the law of their God in their hearts and never depart from it. 
19Ps 37:32 Wicked people watch good people and try to kill them; 
19Ps 37:33 but the LORD will not abandon them to their enemy's power or let them be condemned when they are on trial. 
19Ps 37:34 Put your hope in the LORD and obey his commands; he will honor you by giving you the land, and you will see the wicked driven out. 
19Ps 37:35 I once knew someone wicked who was a tyrant; he towered over everyone like a cedar of Lebanon; 
19Ps 37:36 but later I passed by, and he wasn't there; I looked for him, but couldn't find him. 
19Ps 37:37 Notice good people, observe the righteous; peaceful people have descendants, 
19Ps 37:38 but sinners are completely destroyed, and their descendants are wiped out. 
19Ps 37:39 The LORD saves the righteous and protects them in times of trouble. 
19Ps 37:40 He helps them and rescues them; he saves them from the wicked, because they go to him for protection. 
19Ps 38:1 O LORD, don't punish me in your anger! 
19Ps 38:2 You have wounded me with your arrows; you have struck me down. 
19Ps 38:3 Because of your anger, I am in great pain; my whole body is diseased because of my sins. 
19Ps 38:4 I am drowning in the flood of my sins; they are a burden too heavy to bear. 
19Ps 38:5 Because I have been foolish, my sores stink and rot. 
19Ps 38:6 I am bent over, I am crushed; I mourn all day long. 
19Ps 38:7 I am burning with fever and I am near death. 
19Ps 38:8 I am worn out and utterly crushed; my heart is troubled, and I groan with pain. 
19Ps 38:9 O Lord, you know what I long for; you hear all my groans. 
19Ps 38:10 My heart is pounding, my strength is gone, and my eyes have lost their brightness. 
19Ps 38:11 My friends and neighbors will not come near me, because of my sores; even my family keeps away from me. 
19Ps 38:12 Those who want to kill me lay traps for me, and those who want to hurt me threaten to ruin me; they never stop plotting against me. 
19Ps 38:13 I am like the deaf and cannot hear, like the dumb and cannot speak. 
19Ps 38:14 I am like those who do not answer, because they cannot hear. 
19Ps 38:15 But I trust in you, O LORD; and you, O Lord my God, will answer me. 
19Ps 38:16 Don't let my enemies gloat over my distress; don't let them boast about my downfall! 
19Ps 38:17 I am about to fall and am in constant pain. 
19Ps 38:18 I confess my sins; they fill me with anxiety. 
19Ps 38:19 My enemies are healthy and strong; there are many who hate me for no reason. 
19Ps 38:20 Those who pay back evil for good are against me because I try to do right. 
19Ps 38:21 Do not abandon me, O LORD; do not stay away, my God! 
19Ps 38:22 Help me now, O Lord my savior! 
19Ps 39:1 I said, "I will be careful about what I do and will not let my tongue make me sin; I will not say anything while evil people are near." 
19Ps 39:2 I kept quiet, not saying a word, not even about anything good! But my suffering only grew worse, 
19Ps 39:3 and I was overcome with anxiety. The more I thought, the more troubled I became; I could not keep from asking�� 
19Ps 39:4 " LORD, how long will I live? When will I die? Tell me how soon my life will end." 
19Ps 39:5 How short you have made my life! In your sight my lifetime seems nothing. Indeed every living being is no more than a puff of wind, 
19Ps 39:6 no more than a shadow. All we do is for nothing; we gather wealth, but don't know who will get it. 
19Ps 39:7 What, then, can I hope for, Lord? I put my hope in you. 
19Ps 39:8 Save me from all my sins, and don't let fools make fun of me. 
19Ps 39:9 I will keep quiet, I will not say a word, for you are the one who made me suffer like this. 
19Ps 39:10 Don't punish me any more! I am about to die from your blows. 
19Ps 39:11 You punish our sins by your rebukes, and like a moth you destroy what we love. Indeed we are no more than a puff of wind! 
19Ps 39:12 Hear my prayer, LORD, and listen to my cry; come to my aid when I weep. Like all my ancestors I am only your guest for a little while. 
19Ps 39:13 Leave me alone so that I may have some happiness before I go away and am no more. 
19Ps 40:1 I waited patiently for the LORD's help; then he listened to me and heard my cry. 
19Ps 40:2 He pulled me out of a dangerous pit, out of the deadly quicksand. He set me safely on a rock and made me secure. 
19Ps 40:3 He taught me to sing a new song, a song of praise to our God. Many who see this will take warning and will put their trust in the LORD. 
19Ps 40:4 Happy are those who trust the LORD, who do not turn to idols or join those who worship false gods. 
19Ps 40:5 You have done many things for us, O LORD our God; there is no one like you! You have made many wonderful plans for us. I could never speak of them all - their number is so great! 
19Ps 40:6 You do not want sacrifices and offerings; you do not ask for animals burned whole on the altar or for sacrifices to take away sins. Instead, you have given me ears to hear you, 
19Ps 40:7 and so I answered, "Here I am; your instructions for me are in the book of the Law. 
19Ps 40:8 How I love to do your will, my God! I keep your teaching in my heart." 
19Ps 40:9 In the assembly of all your people, LORD, I told the good news that you save us. You know that I will never stop telling it. 
19Ps 40:10 I have not kept the news of salvation to myself; I have always spoken of your faithfulness and help. In the assembly of all your people I have not been silent about your loyalty and constant love. 
19Ps 40:11 LORD, I know you will never stop being merciful to me. Your love and loyalty will always keep me safe. 
19Ps 40:12 I am surrounded by many troubles - too many to count! My sins have caught up with me, and I can no longer see; they are more than the hairs of my head, and I have lost my courage. 
19Ps 40:13 Save me, LORD! Help me now! 
19Ps 40:14 May those who try to kill me be completely defeated and confused. May those who are happy because of my troubles be turned back and disgraced. 
19Ps 40:15 May those who make fun of me be dismayed by their defeat. 
19Ps 40:16 May all who come to you be glad and joyful. May all who are thankful for your salvation always say, "How great is the LORD!" 
19Ps 40:17 I am weak and poor, O Lord, but you have not forgotten me. You are my savior and my God - hurry to my aid! 
19Ps 41:1 Happy are those who are concerned for the poor; the LORD will help them when they are in trouble. 
19Ps 41:2 The LORD will protect them and preserve their lives; he will make them happy in the land; he will not abandon them to the power of their enemies. 
19Ps 41:3 The LORD will help them when they are sick and will restore them to health. 
19Ps 41:4 I said, "I have sinned against you, LORD; be merciful to me and heal me." 
19Ps 41:5 My enemies say cruel things about me. They want me to die and be forgotten. 
19Ps 41:6 Those who come to see me are not sincere; they gather bad news about me and then go out and tell it everywhere. 
19Ps 41:7 All who hate me whisper to each other about me, they imagine the worst about me. 
19Ps 41:8 They say, "He is fatally ill; he will never leave his bed again." 
19Ps 41:9 Even my best friend, the one I trusted most, the one who shared my food, has turned against me. 
19Ps 41:10 Be merciful to me, LORD, and restore my health, and I will pay my enemies back. 
19Ps 41:11 They will not triumph over me, and I will know that you are pleased with me. 
19Ps 41:12 You will help me, because I do what is right; you will keep me in your presence forever. 
19Ps 41:13 Praise the LORD, the God of Israel! Praise him now and forever! Amen! Amen! 
19Ps 42:1 As a deer longs for a stream of cool water, so I long for you, O God. 
19Ps 42:2 I thirst for you, the living God. When can I go and worship in your presence? 
19Ps 42:3 Day and night I cry, and tears are my only food; all the time my enemies ask me, "Where is your God?" 
19Ps 42:4 My heart breaks when I remember the past, when I went with the crowds to the house of God and led them as they walked along, a happy crowd, singing and shouting praise to God. 
19Ps 42:5 Why am I so sad? Why am I so troubled? I will put my hope in God, and once again I will praise him, my savior and my God. 
19Ps 42:6 Here in exile my heart is breaking, and so I turn my thoughts to him. 
19Ps 42:7 He has sent waves of sorrow over my soul; chaos roars at me like a flood, like waterfalls thundering down to the Jordan from Mount Hermon and Mount Mizar.
19Ps 42:8 May the LORD show his constant love during the day, so that I may have a song at night, a prayer to the God of my life. 
19Ps 42:9 To God, my defender, I say, "Why have you forgotten me? Why must I go on suffering from the cruelty of my enemies?" 
19Ps 42:10 I am crushed by their insults, as they keep on asking me, "Where is your God?" 
19Ps 42:11 Why am I so sad? Why am I so troubled? I will put my hope in God, and once again I will praise him, my savior and my God. 
19Ps 43:1 O God, declare me innocent, and defend my cause against the ungodly; deliver me from lying and evil people! 
19Ps 43:2 You are my protector; why have you abandoned me? Why must I go on suffering from the cruelty of my enemies? 
19Ps 43:3 Send your light and your truth; may they lead me and bring me back to Zion, your sacred hill, and to your Temple, where you live. 
19Ps 43:4 Then I will go to your altar, O God; you are the source of my happiness. I will play my harp and sing praise to you, O God, my God. 
19Ps 43:5 Why am I so sad? Why am I so troubled? I will put my hope in God, and once again I will praise him, my savior and my God. 
19Ps 44:1 With our own ears we have heard it, O God - our ancestors have told us about it, about the great things you did in their time, in the days of long ago�� 
19Ps 44:2 how you yourself drove out the heathen and established your people in their land; how you punished the other nations and caused your own to prosper. 
19Ps 44:3 Your people did not conquer the land with their swords; they did not win it by their own power; it was by your power and your strength, by the assurance of your presence, which showed that you loved them. 
19Ps 44:4 You are my king and my God; you give victory to your people, 
19Ps 44:5 and by your power we defeat our enemies. 
19Ps 44:6 I do not trust in my bow or in my sword to save me; 
19Ps 44:7 but you have saved us from our enemies and defeated those who hate us. 
19Ps 44:8 We will always praise you and give thanks to you forever. 
19Ps 44:9 But now you have rejected us and let us be defeated; you no longer march out with our armies. 
19Ps 44:10 You made us run from our enemies, and they took for themselves what was ours. 
19Ps 44:11 You allowed us to be slaughtered like sheep; you scattered us in foreign countries. 
19Ps 44:12 You sold your own people for a small price as though they had little value. 
19Ps 44:13 Our neighbors see what you did to us, and they mock us and laugh at us. 
19Ps 44:14 You have made us a joke among the nations; they shake their heads at us in scorn. 
19Ps 44:15 I am always in disgrace; I am covered with shame 
19Ps 44:16 from hearing the sneers and insults of my enemies and those who hate me. 
19Ps 44:17 All this has happened to us, even though we have not forgotten you or broken the covenant you made with us. 
19Ps 44:18 We have not been disloyal to you; we have not disobeyed your commands. 
19Ps 44:19 Yet you left us helpless among wild animals; you abandoned us in deepest darkness. 
19Ps 44:20 If we had stopped worshiping our God and prayed to a foreign god, 
19Ps 44:21 you would surely have discovered it, because you know our secret thoughts. 
19Ps 44:22 But it is on your account that we are being killed all the time, that we are treated like sheep to be slaughtered. 
19Ps 44:23 Wake up, Lord! Why are you asleep? Rouse yourself ! Don't reject us forever! 
19Ps 44:24 Why are you hiding from us? Don't forget our suffering and trouble! 
19Ps 44:25 We fall crushed to the ground; we lie defeated in the dust. 
19Ps 44:26 Come to our aid! Because of your constant love save us! 
19Ps 45:1 Beautiful words fill my mind, as I compose this song for the king. Like the pen of a good writer my tongue is ready with a poem. 
19Ps 45:2 You are the most handsome of men; you are an eloquent speaker. God has always blessed you. 
19Ps 45:3 Buckle on your sword, mighty king; you are glorious and majestic. 
19Ps 45:4 Ride on in majesty to victory for the defense of truth and justice! Your strength will win you great victories! 
19Ps 45:5 Your arrows are sharp, they pierce the hearts of your enemies; nations fall down at your feet. 
19Ps 45:6 The kingdom that God has given you will last forever and ever. You rule over your people with justice; 
19Ps 45:7 you love what is right and hate what is evil. That is why God, your God, has chosen you and has poured out more happiness on you than on any other king. 
19Ps 45:8 The perfume of myrrh and aloes is on your clothes; musicians entertain you in palaces decorated with ivory. 
19Ps 45:9 Among the women of your court are daughters of kings, and at the right of your throne stands the queen, wearing ornaments of finest gold. 
19Ps 45:10 Bride of the king, listen to what I say - forget your people and your relatives. 
19Ps 45:11 Your beauty will make the king desire you; he is your master, so you must obey him. 
19Ps 45:12 The people of Tyre will bring you gifts; rich people will try to win your favor. 
19Ps 45:13 The princess is in the palace - how beautiful she is! Her gown is made of gold thread. 
19Ps 45:14 In her colorful gown she is led to the king, followed by her bridesmaids, and they also are brought to him. 
19Ps 45:15 With joy and gladness they come and enter the king's palace. 
19Ps 45:16 You, my king, will have many sons to succeed your ancestors as kings, and you will make them rulers over the whole earth. 
19Ps 45:17 My song will keep your fame alive forever, and everyone will praise you for all time to come. 
19Ps 46:1 God is our shelter and strength, always ready to help in times of trouble. 
19Ps 46:2 So we will not be afraid, even if the earth is shaken and mountains fall into the ocean depths; 
19Ps 46:3 even if the seas roar and rage, and the hills are shaken by the violence. 
19Ps 46:4 There is a river that brings joy to the city of God, to the sacred house of the Most High. 
19Ps 46:5 God is in that city, and it will never be destroyed; at early dawn he will come to its aid. 
19Ps 46:6 Nations are terrified, kingdoms are shaken; God thunders, and the earth dissolves. 
19Ps 46:7 The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. 
19Ps 46:8 Come and see what the LORD has done. See what amazing things he has done on earth. 
19Ps 46:9 He stops wars all over the world; he breaks bows, destroys spears, and sets shields on fire. 
19Ps 46:10 "Stop fighting," he says, "and know that I am God, supreme among the nations, supreme over the world." 
19Ps 46:11 The LORD Almighty is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge. 
19Ps 47:1 Clap your hands for joy, all peoples! Praise God with loud songs! 
19Ps 47:2 The LORD, the Most High, is to be feared; he is a great king, ruling over all the world. 
19Ps 47:3 He gave us victory over the peoples; he made us rule over the nations. 
19Ps 47:4 He chose for us the land where we live, the proud possession of his people, whom he loves. 
19Ps 47:5 God goes up to his throne. There are shouts of joy and the blast of trumpets, as the LORD goes up. 
19Ps 47:6 Sing praise to God; sing praise to our king! 
19Ps 47:7 God is king over all the world; praise him with songs! 
19Ps 47:8 God sits on his sacred throne; he rules over the nations. 
19Ps 47:9 The rulers of the nations assemble with the people of the God of Abraham. More powerful than all armies is he; he rules supreme. 
19Ps 48:1 The LORD is great and is to be highly praised in the city of our God, on his sacred hill. 
19Ps 48:2 Zion, the mountain of God, is high and beautiful; the city of the great king brings joy to all the world. 
19Ps 48:3 God has shown that there is safety with him inside the fortresses of the city. 
19Ps 48:4 The kings gathered together and came to attack Mount Zion. 
19Ps 48:5 But when they saw it, they were amazed; they were afraid and ran away. 
19Ps 48:6 There they were seized with fear and anguish, like a woman about to bear a child, 
19Ps 48:7 like ships tossing in a furious storm. 
19Ps 48:8 We have heard what God has done, and now we have seen it in the city of our God, the LORD Almighty; he will keep the city safe forever. 
19Ps 48:9 Inside your Temple, O God, we think of your constant love. 
19Ps 48:10 You are praised by people everywhere, and your fame extends over all the earth. You rule with justice; 
19Ps 48:11 let the people of Zion be glad! You give right judgments; let there be joy in the cities of Judah! 
19Ps 48:12 People of God, walk around Zion and count the towers; 
19Ps 48:13 take notice of the walls and examine the fortresses, so that you may tell the next generation�� 
19Ps 48:14 "This God is our God forever and ever; he will lead us for all time to come." 
19Ps 49:1 Hear this, everyone! Listen, all people everywhere, 
19Ps 49:2 great and small alike, rich and poor together. 
19Ps 49:3 My thoughts will be clear; I will speak words of wisdom. 
19Ps 49:4 I will turn my attention to proverbs and explain their meaning as I play the harp. 
19Ps 49:5 I am not afraid in times of danger when I am surrounded by enemies, 
19Ps 49:6 by evil people who trust in their riches and boast of their great wealth. 
19Ps 49:7 We can never redeem ourselves; we cannot pay God the price for our lives, 
19Ps 49:8 because the payment for a human life is too great. What we could pay would never be enough 
19Ps 49:9 to keep us from the grave, to let us live forever. 
19Ps 49:10 Anyone can see that even the wise die, as well as the foolish and stupid. They all leave their riches to their descendants. 
19Ps 49:11 Their graves are their homes forever; there they stay for all time, though they once had lands of their own. 
19Ps 49:12 Our greatness cannot keep us from death; we will still die like the animals. 
19Ps 49:13 See what happens to those who trust in themselves, the fate of those who are satisfied with their wealth - 
19Ps 49:14 they are doomed to die like sheep, and Death will be their shepherd. The righteous will triumph over them, as their bodies quickly decay in the world of the dead far from their homes. 
19Ps 49:15 But God will rescue me; he will save me from the power of death. 
19Ps 49:16 Don't be upset when someone becomes rich, when his wealth grows even greater; 
19Ps 49:17 he cannot take it with him when he dies; his wealth will not go with him to the grave. 
19Ps 49:18 Even if someone is satisfied with this life and is praised because he is successful, 
19Ps 49:19 he will join all his ancestors in death, where the darkness lasts forever. 
19Ps 49:20 Our greatness cannot keep us from death; we will still die like the animals. 
19Ps 50:1 The Almighty God, the LORD, speaks; he calls to the whole earth from east to west. 
19Ps 50:2 God shines from Zion, the city perfect in its beauty. 
19Ps 50:3 Our God is coming, but not in silence; a raging fire is in front of him, a furious storm around him. 
19Ps 50:4 He calls heaven and earth as witnesses to see him judge his people. 
19Ps 50:5 He says, "Gather my faithful people to me, those who made a covenant with me by offering a sacrifice." 
19Ps 50:6 The heavens proclaim that God is righteous, that he himself is judge. 
19Ps 50:7 "Listen, my people, and I will speak; I will testify against you, Israel. I am God, your God. 
19Ps 50:8 I do not reprimand you because of your sacrifices and the burnt offerings you always bring me. 
19Ps 50:9 And yet I do not need bulls from your farms or goats from your flocks; 
19Ps 50:10 all the animals in the forest are mine and the cattle on thousands of hills. 
19Ps 50:11 All the wild birds are mine and all living things in the fields. 
19Ps 50:12 "If I were hungry, I would not ask you for food, for the world and everything in it is mine. 
19Ps 50:13 Do I eat the flesh of bulls or drink the blood of goats? 
19Ps 50:14 Let the giving of thanks be your sacrifice to God, and give the Almighty all that you promised. 
19Ps 50:15 Call to me when trouble comes; I will save you, and you will praise me." 
19Ps 50:16 But God says to the wicked, "Why should you recite my commandments? Why should you talk about my covenant? 
19Ps 50:17 You refuse to let me correct you; you reject my commands. 
19Ps 50:18 You become the friend of every thief you see, and you associate with adulterers. 
19Ps 50:19 "You are always ready to speak evil; you never hesitate to tell lies. 
19Ps 50:20 You are ready to accuse your own relatives and to find fault with them. 
19Ps 50:21 You have done all this, and I have said nothing, so you thought that I am like you. But now I reprimand you and make the matter plain to you. 
19Ps 50:22 "Listen to this, you that ignore me, or I will destroy you, and there will be no one to save you. 
19Ps 50:23 Giving thanks is the sacrifice that honors me, and I will surely save all who obey me." 
19Ps 51:1 Be merciful to me, O God, because of your constant love. Because of your great mercy wipe away my sins! 
19Ps 51:2 Wash away all my evil and make me clean from my sin! 
19Ps 51:3 I recognize my faults; I am always conscious of my sins. 
19Ps 51:4 I have sinned against you - only against you - and done what you consider evil. So you are right in judging me; you are justified in condemning me. 
19Ps 51:5 I have been evil from the day I was born; from the time I was conceived, I have been sinful. 
19Ps 51:6 Sincerity and truth are what you require; fill my mind with your wisdom. 
19Ps 51:7 Remove my sin, and I will be clean; wash me, and I will be whiter than snow. 
19Ps 51:8 Let me hear the sounds of joy and gladness; and though you have crushed me and broken me, I will be happy once again. 
19Ps 51:9 Close your eyes to my sins and wipe out all my evil. 
19Ps 51:10 Create a pure heart in me, O God, and put a new and loyal spirit in me. 
19Ps 51:11 Do not banish me from your presence; do not take your holy spirit away from me. 
19Ps 51:12 Give me again the joy that comes from your salvation, and make me willing to obey you. 
19Ps 51:13 Then I will teach sinners your commands, and they will turn back to you. 
19Ps 51:14 Spare my life, O God, and save me, and I will gladly proclaim your righteousness. 
19Ps 51:15 Help me to speak, Lord, and I will praise you. 
19Ps 51:16 You do not want sacrifices, or I would offer them; you are not pleased with burnt offerings. 
19Ps 51:17 My sacrifice is a humble spirit, O God; you will not reject a humble and repentant heart. 
19Ps 51:18 O God, be kind to Zion and help her; rebuild the walls of Jerusalem. 
19Ps 51:19 Then you will be pleased with proper sacrifices and with our burnt offerings; and bulls will be sacrificed on your altar. 
19Ps 52:1 Why do you boast, great one, of your evil? God's faithfulness is eternal. 
19Ps 52:2 You make plans to ruin others; your tongue is like a sharp razor. You are always inventing lies. 
19Ps 52:3 You love evil more than good and falsehood more than truth. 
19Ps 52:4 You love to hurt people with your words, you liar! 
19Ps 52:5 So God will ruin you forever; he will take hold of you and snatch you from your home; he will remove you from the world of the living. 
19Ps 52:6 Righteous people will see this and be afraid; then they will laugh at you and say, 
19Ps 52:7 "Look, here is someone who did not depend on God for safety, but trusted instead in great wealth and looked for security in being wicked." 
19Ps 52:8 But I am like an olive tree growing in the house of God; I trust in his constant love forever and ever. 
19Ps 52:9 I will always thank you, God, for what you have done; in the presence of your people I will proclaim that you are good. 
19Ps 53:1 Fools say to themselves, "There is no God." They are all corrupt, and they have done terrible things; there is no one who does what is right. 
19Ps 53:2 God looks down from heaven at people to see if there are any who are wise, any who worship him. 
19Ps 53:3 But they have all turned away; they are all equally bad. Not one of them does what is right, not a single one. 
19Ps 53:4 "Don't they know?" God asks. "Are these evildoers ignorant? They live by robbing my people, and they never pray to me." 
19Ps 53:5 But then they will become terrified, as they have never been before, for God will scatter the bones of the enemies of his people. God has rejected them, and so Israel will totally defeat them. 
19Ps 53:6 How I pray that victory will come to Israel from Zion. How happy the people of Israel will be when God makes them prosperous again! 
19Ps 54:1 Save me by your power, O God; set me free by your might! 
19Ps 54:2 Hear my prayer, O God; listen to my words! 
19Ps 54:3 Proud people are coming to attack me; cruel people are trying to kill me - those who do not care about God. 
19Ps 54:4 But God is my helper. The Lord is my defender. 
19Ps 54:5 May God use their own evil to punish my enemies. He will destroy them because he is faithful. 
19Ps 54:6 I will gladly offer you a sacrifice, O LORD; I will give you thanks because you are good. 
19Ps 54:7 You have rescued me from all my troubles, and I have seen my enemies defeated. 
19Ps 55:1 Hear my prayer, O God; don't turn away from my plea! 
19Ps 55:2 Listen to me and answer me; I am worn out by my worries. 
19Ps 55:3 I am terrified by the threats of my enemies, crushed by the oppression of the wicked. They bring trouble on me; they are angry with me and hate me. 
19Ps 55:4 I am terrified, and the terrors of death crush me. 
19Ps 55:5 I am gripped by fear and trembling; I am overcome with horror. 
19Ps 55:6 I wish I had wings like a dove. I would fly away and find rest. 
19Ps 55:7 I would fly far away and make my home in the desert. 
19Ps 55:8 I would hurry and find myself a shelter from the raging wind and the storm. 
19Ps 55:9 Confuse the speech of my enemies, O Lord! I see violence and riots in the city, 
19Ps 55:10 surrounding it day and night, filling it with crime and trouble. 
19Ps 55:11 There is destruction everywhere; the streets are full of oppression and fraud. 
19Ps 55:12 If it were an enemy making fun of me, I could endure it; if it were an opponent boasting over me, I could hide myself from him. 
19Ps 55:13 But it is you, my companion, my colleague and close friend. 
19Ps 55:14 We had intimate talks with each other and worshiped together in the Temple. 
19Ps 55:15 May my enemies die before their time; may they go down alive into the world of the dead! Evil is in their homes and in their hearts. 
19Ps 55:16 But I call to the LORD God for help, and he will save me. 
19Ps 55:17 Morning, noon, and night my complaints and groans go up to him, and he will hear my voice. 
19Ps 55:18 He will bring me safely back from the battles that I fight against so many enemies. 
19Ps 55:19 God, who has ruled from eternity, will hear me and defeat them; for they refuse to change, and they do not fear him. 
19Ps 55:20 My former companion attacked his friends; he broke his promises. 
19Ps 55:21 His words were smoother than cream, but there was hatred in his heart; his words were as soothing as oil, but they cut like sharp swords. 
19Ps 55:22 Leave your troubles with the LORD, and he will defend you; he never lets honest people be defeated. 
19Ps 55:23 But you, O God, will bring those murderers and liars to their graves before half their life is over. As for me, I will trust in you. 
19Ps 56:1 Be merciful to me, O God, because I am under attack; my enemies persecute me all the time. 
19Ps 56:2 All day long my opponents attack me. There are so many who fight against me. 
19Ps 56:3 When I am afraid, O LORD Almighty, I put my trust in you. 
19Ps 56:4 I trust in God and am not afraid; I praise him for what he has promised. What can a mere human being do to me? 
19Ps 56:5 My enemies make trouble for me all day long; they are always thinking up some way to hurt me! 
19Ps 56:6 They gather in hiding places and watch everything I do, hoping to kill me. 
19Ps 56:7 Punish them, O God, for their evil; defeat those people in your anger! 
19Ps 56:8 You know how troubled I am; you have kept a record of my tears. Aren't they listed in your book? 
19Ps 56:9 The day I call to you, my enemies will be turned back. I know this�� God is on my side - 
19Ps 56:10 the LORD, whose promises I praise. 
19Ps 56:11 In him I trust, and I will not be afraid. What can a mere human being do to me? 
19Ps 56:12 O God, I will offer you what I have promised; I will give you my offering of thanksgiving, 
19Ps 56:13 because you have rescued me from death and kept me from defeat. And so I walk in the presence of God, in the light that shines on the living. 
19Ps 57:1 Be merciful to me, O God, be merciful, because I come to you for safety. In the shadow of your wings I find protection until the raging storms are over. 
19Ps 57:2 I call to God, the Most High, to God, who supplies my every need. 
19Ps 57:3 He will answer from heaven and save me; he will defeat my oppressors. God will show me his constant love and faithfulness. 
19Ps 57:4 I am surrounded by enemies, who are like lions hungry for human flesh. Their teeth are like spears and arrows; their tongues are like sharp swords. 
19Ps 57:5 Show your greatness in the sky, O God, and your glory over all the earth. 
19Ps 57:6 My enemies have spread a net to catch me; I am overcome with distress. They dug a pit in my path, but fell into it themselves. 
19Ps 57:7 I have complete confidence, O God; I will sing and praise you! 
19Ps 57:8 Wake up, my soul! Wake up, my harp and lyre! I will wake up the sun. 
19Ps 57:9 I will thank you, O Lord, among the nations. I will praise you among the peoples. 
19Ps 57:10 Your constant love reaches the heavens; your faithfulness touches the skies. 
19Ps 57:11 Show your greatness in the sky, O God, and your glory over all the earth. 
19Ps 58:1 Do you rulers ever give a just decision? Do you judge everyone fairly? 
19Ps 58:2 No! You think only of the evil you can do, and commit crimes of violence in the land. 
19Ps 58:3 Evildoers go wrong all their lives; they tell lies from the day they are born. 
19Ps 58:4 They are full of poison like snakes; they stop up their ears like a deaf cobra, 
19Ps 58:5 which does not hear the voice of the snake charmer, or the chant of the clever magician. 
19Ps 58:6 Break the teeth of these fierce lions, O God. 
19Ps 58:7 May they disappear like water draining away; may they be crushed like weeds on a path. 
19Ps 58:8 May they be like snails that dissolve into slime; may they be like a baby born dead that never sees the light. 
19Ps 58:9 Before they know it, they are cut down like weeds; in his fierce anger God will blow them away while they are still living. 
19Ps 58:10 The righteous will be glad when they see sinners punished; they will wade through the blood of the wicked. 
19Ps 58:11 People will say, "The righteous are indeed rewarded; there is indeed a God who judges the world." 
19Ps 59:1 Save me from my enemies, my God; protect me from those who attack me! 
19Ps 59:2 Save me from those evil people; rescue me from those murderers! 
19Ps 59:3 Look! They are waiting to kill me; cruel people are gathering against me. It is not because of any sin or wrong I have done, 
19Ps 59:4 nor because of any fault of mine, O LORD, that they hurry to their places. 
19Ps 59:5 Rise, LORD God Almighty, and come to my aid; see for yourself, God of Israel! Wake up and punish the heathen; show no mercy to evil traitors! 
19Ps 59:6 They come back in the evening, snarling like dogs as they go about the city. 
19Ps 59:7 Listen to their insults and threats. Their tongues are like swords in their mouths, yet they think that no one hears them. 
19Ps 59:8 But you laugh at them, LORD; you mock all the heathen. 
19Ps 59:9 I have confidence in your strength; you are my refuge, O God. 
19Ps 59:10 My God loves me and will come to me; he will let me see my enemies defeated. 
19Ps 59:11 Do not kill them, O God, or my people may forget. Scatter them by your strength and defeat them, O Lord, our protector. 
19Ps 59:12 Sin is on their lips; all their words are sinful; may they be caught in their pride! Because they curse and lie, 
19Ps 59:13 destroy them in your anger; destroy them completely. Then everyone will know that God rules in Israel, that his rule extends over all the earth. 
19Ps 59:14 My enemies come back in the evening, snarling like dogs as they go about the city, 
19Ps 59:15 like dogs roaming about for food and growling if they do not find enough. 
19Ps 59:16 But I will sing about your strength; every morning I will sing aloud of your constant love. You have been a refuge for me, a shelter in my time of trouble. 
19Ps 59:17 I will praise you, my defender. My refuge is God, the God who loves me. 
19Ps 60:1 You have rejected us, God, and defeated us; you have been angry with us - but now turn back to us. 
19Ps 60:2 You have made the land tremble, and you have cut it open; now heal its wounds, because it is falling apart. 
19Ps 60:3 You have made your people suffer greatly; we stagger around as though we were drunk. 
19Ps 60:4 You have warned those who have reverence for you, so that they might escape destruction. 
19Ps 60:5 Save us by your might; answer our prayer, so that the people you love may be rescued. 
19Ps 60:6 From his sanctuary God has said, "In triumph I will divide Shechem and distribute Sukkoth Valley to my people. 
19Ps 60:7 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh too; Ephraim is my helmet and Judah my royal scepter. 
19Ps 60:8 But I will use Moab as my washbowl, and I will throw my sandals on Edom, as a sign that I own it. Did the Philistines think they would shout in triumph over me?" 
19Ps 60:9 Who, O God, will take me into the fortified city? Who will lead me to Edom? 
19Ps 60:10 Have you really rejected us? Aren't you going to march out with our armies? 
19Ps 60:11 Help us against the enemy; human help is worthless. 
19Ps 60:12 With God on our side we will win; he will defeat our enemies. 
19Ps 61:1 Hear my cry, O God; listen to my prayer! 
19Ps 61:2 In despair and far from home I call to you! Take me to a safe refuge, 
19Ps 61:3 for you are my protector, my strong defense against my enemies. 
19Ps 61:4 Let me live in your sanctuary all my life; let me find safety under your wings. 
19Ps 61:5 You have heard my promises, O God, and you have given me what belongs to those who honor you. 
19Ps 61:6 Add many years to the king's life; let him live on and on! 
19Ps 61:7 May he rule forever in your presence, O God; protect him with your constant love and faithfulness. 
19Ps 61:8 So I will always sing praises to you, as I offer you daily what I have promised. 
19Ps 62:1 I wait patiently for God to save me; I depend on him alone. 
19Ps 62:2 He alone protects and saves me; he is my defender, and I shall never be defeated. 
19Ps 62:3 How much longer will all of you attack someone who is no stronger than a broken-down fence? 
19Ps 62:4 You only want to bring him down from his place of honor; you take pleasure in lies. You speak words of blessing, but in your heart you curse him. 
19Ps 62:5 I depend on God alone; I put my hope in him. 
19Ps 62:6 He alone protects and saves me; he is my defender, and I shall never be defeated. 
19Ps 62:7 My salvation and honor depend on God; he is my strong protector; he is my shelter. 
19Ps 62:8 Trust in God at all times, my people. Tell him all your troubles, for he is our refuge. 
19Ps 62:9 Human beings are all like a puff of breath; great and small alike are worthless. Put them on the scales, and they weigh nothing; they are lighter than a mere breath. 
19Ps 62:10 Don't put your trust in violence; don't hope to gain anything by robbery; even if your riches increase, don't depend on them. 
19Ps 62:11 More than once I have heard God say that power belongs to him 
19Ps 62:12 and that his love is constant. You yourself, O Lord, reward everyone according to their deeds. 
19Ps 63:1 O God, you are my God, and I long for you. My whole being desires you; like a dry, worn-out, and waterless land, my soul is thirsty for you. 
19Ps 63:2 Let me see you in the sanctuary; let me see how mighty and glorious you are. 
19Ps 63:3 Your constant love is better than life itself, and so I will praise you. 
19Ps 63:4 I will give you thanks as long as I live; I will raise my hands to you in prayer. 
19Ps 63:5 My soul will feast and be satisfied, and I will sing glad songs of praise to you. 
19Ps 63:6 As I lie in bed, I remember you; all night long I think of you, 
19Ps 63:7 because you have always been my help. In the shadow of your wings I sing for joy. 
19Ps 63:8 I cling to you, and your hand keeps me safe. 
19Ps 63:9 Those who are trying to kill me will go down into the world of the dead. 
19Ps 63:10 They will be killed in battle, and their bodies eaten by wolves. 
19Ps 63:11 Because God gives him victory, the king will rejoice. Those who make promises in God's name will praise him, but the mouths of liars will be shut. 
19Ps 64:1 I am in trouble, God - listen to my prayer! I am afraid of my enemies - save my life! 
19Ps 64:2 Protect me from the plots of the wicked, from mobs of evil people. 
19Ps 64:3 They sharpen their tongues like swords and aim cruel words like arrows. 
19Ps 64:4 They are quick to spread their shameless lies; they destroy good people with cowardly slander. 
19Ps 64:5 They encourage each other in their evil plots; they talk about where they will place their traps. "No one can see them," they say. 
19Ps 64:6 They make evil plans and say, "We have planned a perfect crime." The human heart and mind are a mystery. 
19Ps 64:7 But God shoots his arrows at them, and suddenly they are wounded. 
19Ps 64:8 He will destroy them because of those words; all who see them will shake their heads. 
19Ps 64:9 They will all be afraid; they will think about what God has done and tell about his deeds. 
19Ps 64:10 All righteous people will rejoice because of what the LORD has done. They will find safety in him; all good people will praise him. 
19Ps 65:1 O God, it is right for us to praise you in Zion and keep our promises to you, 
19Ps 65:2 because you answer prayers. People everywhere will come to you 
19Ps 65:3 on account of their sins. Our faults defeat us, but you forgive them. 
19Ps 65:4 Happy are those whom you choose, whom you bring to live in your sanctuary. We shall be satisfied with the good things of your house, the blessings of your sacred Temple. 
19Ps 65:5 You answer us by giving us victory, and you do wonderful things to save us. People all over the world and across the distant seas trust in you. 
19Ps 65:6 You set the mountains in place by your strength, showing your mighty power. 
19Ps 65:7 You calm the roar of the seas and the noise of the waves; you calm the uproar of the peoples. 
19Ps 65:8 The whole world stands in awe of the great things that you have done. Your deeds bring shouts of joy from one end of the earth to the other. 
19Ps 65:9 You show your care for the land by sending rain; you make it rich and fertile. You fill the streams with water; you provide the earth with crops. This is how you do it�� 
19Ps 65:10 you send abundant rain on the plowed fields and soak them with water; you soften the soil with showers and cause the young plants to grow. 
19Ps 65:11 What a rich harvest your goodness provides! Wherever you go there is plenty. 
19Ps 65:12 The pastures are filled with flocks; the hillsides are full of joy. 
19Ps 65:13 The fields are covered with sheep; the valleys are full of wheat. Everything shouts and sings for joy. 
19Ps 66:1 Praise God with shouts of joy, all people! 
19Ps 66:2 Sing to the glory of his name; offer him glorious praise! 
19Ps 66:3 Say to God, "How wonderful are the things you do! Your power is so great that your enemies bow down in fear before you. 
19Ps 66:4 Everyone on earth worships you; they sing praises to you, they sing praises to your name." 
19Ps 66:5 Come and see what God has done, his wonderful acts among people. 
19Ps 66:6 He changed the sea into dry land; our ancestors crossed the river on foot. There we rejoiced because of what he did. 
19Ps 66:7 He rules forever by his might and keeps his eyes on the nations. Let no rebels rise against him. 
19Ps 66:8 Praise our God, all nations; let your praise be heard. 
19Ps 66:9 He has kept us alive and has not allowed us to fall. 
19Ps 66:10 You have put us to the test, God; as silver is purified by fire, so you have tested us. 
19Ps 66:11 You let us fall into a trap and placed heavy burdens on our backs. 
19Ps 66:12 You let our enemies trample us; we went through fire and flood, but now you have brought us to a place of safety. 
19Ps 66:13 I will bring burnt offerings to your house; I will offer you what I promised. 
19Ps 66:14 I will give you what I said I would when I was in trouble. 
19Ps 66:15 I will offer sheep to be burned on the altar; I will sacrifice bulls and goats, and the smoke will go up to the sky. 
19Ps 66:16 Come and listen, all who honor God, and I will tell you what he has done for me. 
19Ps 66:17 I cried to him for help; I praised him with songs. 
19Ps 66:18 If I had ignored my sins, the Lord would not have listened to me. 
19Ps 66:19 But God has indeed heard me; he has listened to my prayer. 
19Ps 66:20 I praise God, because he did not reject my prayer or keep back his constant love from me. 
19Ps 67:1 God, be merciful to us and bless us; look on us with kindness, 
19Ps 67:2 so that the whole world may know your will; so that all nations may know your salvation. 
19Ps 67:3 May the peoples praise you, O God; may all the peoples praise you! 
19Ps 67:4 May the nations be glad and sing for joy, because you judge the peoples with justice and guide every nation on earth. 
19Ps 67:5 May the peoples praise you, O God; may all the peoples praise you! 
19Ps 67:6 The land has produced its harvest; God, our God, has blessed us. 
19Ps 67:7 God has blessed us; may all people everywhere honor him. 
19Ps 68:1 God rises up and scatters his enemies. Those who hate him run away in defeat. 
19Ps 68:2 As smoke is blown away, so he drives them off; as wax melts in front of the fire, so do the wicked perish in God's presence. 
19Ps 68:3 But the righteous are glad and rejoice in his presence; they are happy and shout for joy. 
19Ps 68:4 Sing to God, sing praises to his name; prepare a way for him who rides on the clouds. His name is the LORD - be glad in his presence! 
19Ps 68:5 God, who lives in his sacred Temple, cares for orphans and protects widows. 
19Ps 68:6 He gives the lonely a home to live in and leads prisoners out into happy freedom, but rebels will have to live in a desolate land. 
19Ps 68:7 O God, when you led your people, when you marched across the desert, 
19Ps 68:8 the earth shook, and the sky poured down rain, because of the coming of the God of Sinai, the coming of the God of Israel. 
19Ps 68:9 You caused abundant rain to fall and restored your worn-out land; 
19Ps 68:10 your people made their home there; in your goodness you provided for the poor. 
19Ps 68:11 The Lord gave the command, and many women carried the news�� 
19Ps 68:12 "Kings and their armies are running away!" The women at home divided what was captured�� 
19Ps 68:13 figures of doves covered with silver, whose wings glittered with fine gold. (Why did some of you stay among the sheep pens on the day of battle?) 
19Ps 68:14 When Almighty God scattered the kings on Mount Zalmon, he caused snow to fall there. 
19Ps 68:15 What a mighty mountain is Bashan, a mountain of many peaks! 
19Ps 68:16 Why from your mighty peaks do you look with scorn on the mountain on which God chose to live? The LORD will live there forever! 
19Ps 68:17 With his many thousands of mighty chariots the Lord comes from Sinai into the holy place. 
19Ps 68:18 He goes up to the heights, taking many captives with him; he receives gifts from rebellious people. The LORD God will live there. 
19Ps 68:19 Praise the Lord, who carries our burdens day after day; he is the God who saves us. 
19Ps 68:20 Our God is a God who saves; he is the LORD, our Lord, who rescues us from death. 
19Ps 68:21 God will surely break the heads of his enemies, of those who persist in their sinful ways. 
19Ps 68:22 The Lord has said, "I will bring your enemies back from Bashan; I will bring them back from the depths of the ocean, 
19Ps 68:23 so that you may wade in their blood, and your dogs may lap up as much as they want." 
19Ps 68:24 O God, your march of triumph is seen by all, the procession of God, my king, into his sanctuary. 
19Ps 68:25 The singers are in front, the musicians are behind, in between are the young women beating the tambourines. 
19Ps 68:26 "Praise God in the meeting of his people; praise the LORD, all you descendants of Jacob!" 
19Ps 68:27 First comes Benjamin, the smallest tribe, then the leaders of Judah with their group, followed by the leaders of Zebulun and Naphtali. 
19Ps 68:28 Show your power, O God, the power you have used on our behalf 
19Ps 68:29 from your Temple in Jerusalem, where kings bring gifts to you. 
19Ps 68:30 Rebuke Egypt, that wild animal in the reeds; rebuke the nations, that herd of bulls with their calves, until they all bow down and offer you their silver. Scatter those people who love to make war! 
19Ps 68:31 Ambassadors will come from Egypt; the Ethiopians will raise their hands in prayer to God. 
19Ps 68:32 Sing to God, kingdoms of the world, sing praise to the Lord, 
19Ps 68:33 to him who rides in the sky, the ancient sky. Listen to him shout with a mighty roar. 
19Ps 68:34 Proclaim God's power; his majesty is over Israel, his might is in the skies. 
19Ps 68:35 How awesome is God as he comes from his sanctuary - the God of Israel! He gives strength and power to his people. Praise God! 
19Ps 69:1 Save me, O God! The water is up to my neck; 
19Ps 69:2 I am sinking in deep mud, and there is no solid ground; I am out in deep water, and the waves are about to drown me. 
19Ps 69:3 I am worn out from calling for help, and my throat is aching. I have strained my eyes, looking for your help. 
19Ps 69:4 Those who hate me for no reason are more numerous than the hairs of my head. My enemies tell lies against me; they are strong and want to kill me. They made me give back things I did not steal. 
19Ps 69:5 My sins, O God, are not hidden from you; you know how foolish I have been. 
19Ps 69:6 Don't let me bring shame on those who trust in you, Sovereign LORD Almighty! Don't let me bring disgrace to those who worship you, O God of Israel! 
19Ps 69:7 It is for your sake that I have been insulted and that I am covered with shame. 
19Ps 69:8 I am like a stranger to my relatives, like a foreigner to my family. 
19Ps 69:9 My devotion to your Temple burns in me like a fire; the insults which are hurled at you fall on me. 
19Ps 69:10 I humble myself by fasting, and people insult me; 
19Ps 69:11 I dress myself in clothes of mourning, and they laugh at me. 
19Ps 69:12 They talk about me in the streets, and drunkards make up songs about me. 
19Ps 69:13 But as for me, I will pray to you, LORD; answer me, God, at a time you choose. Answer me because of your great love, because you keep your promise to save. 
19Ps 69:14 Save me from sinking in the mud; keep me safe from my enemies, safe from the deep water. 
19Ps 69:15 Don't let the flood come over me; don't let me drown in the depths or sink into the grave. 
19Ps 69:16 Answer me, LORD, in the goodness of your constant love; in your great compassion turn to me! 
19Ps 69:17 Don't hide yourself from your servant; I am in great trouble - answer me now! 
19Ps 69:18 Come to me and save me; rescue me from my enemies. 
19Ps 69:19 You know how I am insulted, how I am disgraced and dishonored; you see all my enemies. 
19Ps 69:20 Insults have broken my heart, and I am in despair. I had hoped for sympathy, but there was none; for comfort, but I found none. 
19Ps 69:21 When I was hungry, they gave me poison; when I was thirsty, they offered me vinegar. 
19Ps 69:22 May their banquets cause their ruin; may their sacred feasts cause their downfall. 
19Ps 69:23 Strike them with blindness! Make their backs always weak! 
19Ps 69:24 Pour out your anger on them; let your indignation overtake them. 
19Ps 69:25 May their camps be left deserted; may no one be left alive in their tents. 
19Ps 69:26 They persecute those whom you have punished; they talk about the sufferings of those you have wounded. 
19Ps 69:27 Keep a record of all their sins; don't let them have any part in your salvation. 
19Ps 69:28 May their names be erased from the book of the living; may they not be included in the list of your people. 
19Ps 69:29 But I am in pain and despair; lift me up, O God, and save me! 
19Ps 69:30 I will praise God with a song; I will proclaim his greatness by giving him thanks. 
19Ps 69:31 This will please the LORD more than offering him cattle, more than sacrificing a full-grown bull. 
19Ps 69:32 When the oppressed see this, they will be glad; those who worship God will be encouraged. 
19Ps 69:33 The LORD listens to those in need and does not forget his people in prison. 
19Ps 69:34 Praise God, O heaven and earth, seas and all creatures in them. 
19Ps 69:35 He will save Jerusalem and rebuild the towns of Judah. His people will live there and possess the land; 
19Ps 69:36 the descendants of his servants will inherit it, and those who love him will live there. 
19Ps 70:1 Save me, O God! LORD, help me now! 
19Ps 70:2 May those who try to kill me be defeated and confused. May those who are happy because of my troubles be turned back and disgraced. 
19Ps 70:3 May those who make fun of me be dismayed by their defeat. 
19Ps 70:4 May all who come to you be glad and joyful. May all who are thankful for your salvation always say, "How great is God!" 
19Ps 70:5 I am weak and poor; come to me quickly, O God. You are my savior and my LORD - hurry to my aid! 
19Ps 71:1 LORD, I have come to you for protection; never let me be defeated! 
19Ps 71:2 Because you are righteous, help me and rescue me. Listen to me and save me! 
19Ps 71:3 Be my secure shelter and a strong fortress to protect me; you are my refuge and defense. 
19Ps 71:4 My God, rescue me from wicked people, from the power of cruel and evil people. 
19Ps 71:5 Sovereign LORD, I put my hope in you; I have trusted in you since I was young. 
19Ps 71:6 I have relied on you all my life; you have protected me since the day I was born. I will always praise you. 
19Ps 71:7 My life has been an example to many, because you have been my strong defender. 
19Ps 71:8 All day long I praise you and proclaim your glory. 
19Ps 71:9 Do not reject me now that I am old; do not abandon me now that I am feeble. 
19Ps 71:10 My enemies want to kill me; they talk and plot against me. 
19Ps 71:11 They say, "God has abandoned him; let's go after him and catch him; there is no one to rescue him." 
19Ps 71:12 Don't stay so far away, O God; my God, hurry to my aid! 
19Ps 71:13 May those who attack me be defeated and destroyed. May those who try to hurt me be shamed and disgraced. 
19Ps 71:14 I will always put my hope in you; I will praise you more and more. 
19Ps 71:15 I will tell of your goodness; all day long I will speak of your salvation, though it is more than I can understand. 
19Ps 71:16 I will go in the strength of the LORD God; I will proclaim your goodness, yours alone. 
19Ps 71:17 You have taught me ever since I was young, and I still tell of your wonderful acts. 
19Ps 71:18 Now that I am old and my hair is gray, do not abandon me, O God! Be with me while I proclaim your power and might to all generations to come. 
19Ps 71:19 Your righteousness, God, reaches the skies. You have done great things; there is no one like you. 
19Ps 71:20 You have sent troubles and suffering on me, but you will restore my strength; you will keep me from the grave. 
19Ps 71:21 You will make me greater than ever; you will comfort me again. 
19Ps 71:22 I will indeed praise you with the harp; I will praise your faithfulness, my God. On my harp I will play hymns to you, the Holy One of Israel. 
19Ps 71:23 I will shout for joy as I play for you; with my whole being I will sing because you have saved me. 
19Ps 71:24 I will speak of your righteousness all day long, because those who tried to harm me have been defeated and disgraced. 
19Ps 72:1 Teach the king to judge with your righteousness, O God; share with him your own justice, 
19Ps 72:2 so that he will rule over your people with justice and govern the oppressed with righteousness. 
19Ps 72:3 May the land enjoy prosperity; may it experience righteousness. 
19Ps 72:4 May the king judge the poor fairly; may he help the needy and defeat their oppressors. 
19Ps 72:5 May your people worship you as long as the sun shines, as long as the moon gives light, for ages to come. 
19Ps 72:6 May the king be like rain on the fields, like showers falling on the land. 
19Ps 72:7 May righteousness flourish in his lifetime, and may prosperity last as long as the moon gives light. 
19Ps 72:8 His kingdom will reach from sea to sea, from the Euphrates to the ends of the earth. 
19Ps 72:9 The peoples of the desert will bow down before him; his enemies will throw themselves to the ground. 
19Ps 72:10 The kings of Spain and of the islands will offer him gifts; the kings of Sheba and Seba will bring him offerings. 
19Ps 72:11 All kings will bow down before him; all nations will serve him. 
19Ps 72:12 He rescues the poor who call to him, and those who are needy and neglected. 
19Ps 72:13 He has pity on the weak and poor; he saves the lives of those in need. 
19Ps 72:14 He rescues them from oppression and violence; their lives are precious to him. 
19Ps 72:15 Long live the king! May he be given gold from Sheba; may prayers be said for him at all times; may God's blessings be on him always! 
19Ps 72:16 May there be plenty of grain in the land; may the hills be covered with crops, as fruitful as those of Lebanon. May the cities be filled with people, like fields full of grass. 
19Ps 72:17 May the king's name never be forgotten; may his fame last as long as the sun. May all nations ask God to bless them as he has blessed the king. 
19Ps 72:18 Praise the LORD, the God of Israel! He alone does these wonderful things. 
19Ps 72:19 Praise his glorious name forever! May his glory fill the whole world. Amen! Amen! 
19Ps 72:20 This is the end of the prayers of David son of Jesse. 
19Ps 73:1 God is indeed good to Israel, to those who have pure hearts. 
19Ps 73:2 But I had nearly lost confidence; my faith was almost gone 
19Ps 73:3 because I was jealous of the proud when I saw that things go well for the wicked. 
19Ps 73:4 They do not suffer pain; they are strong and healthy. 
19Ps 73:5 They do not suffer as other people do; they do not have the troubles that others have. 
19Ps 73:6 And so they wear pride like a necklace and violence like a robe; 
19Ps 73:7 their hearts pour out evil, and their minds are busy with wicked schemes. 
19Ps 73:8 They laugh at other people and speak of evil things; they are proud and make plans to oppress others. 
19Ps 73:9 They speak evil of God in heaven and give arrogant orders to everyone on earth, 
19Ps 73:10 so that even God's people turn to them and eagerly believe whatever they say. 
19Ps 73:11 They say, "God will not know; the Most High will not find out." 
19Ps 73:12 That is what the wicked are like. They have plenty and are always getting more. 
19Ps 73:13 Is it for nothing, then, that I have kept myself pure and have not committed sin? 
19Ps 73:14 O God, you have made me suffer all day long; every morning you have punished me. 
19Ps 73:15 If I had said such things, I would not be acting as one of your people. 
19Ps 73:16 I tried to think this problem through, but it was too difficult for me 
19Ps 73:17 until I went into your Temple. Then I understood what will happen to the wicked. 
19Ps 73:18 You will put them in slippery places and make them fall to destruction! 
19Ps 73:19 They are instantly destroyed; they go down to a horrible end. 
19Ps 73:20 They are like a dream that goes away in the morning; when you rouse yourself, O Lord, they disappear. 
19Ps 73:21 When my thoughts were bitter and my feelings were hurt, 
19Ps 73:22 I was as stupid as an animal; I did not understand you. 
19Ps 73:23 Yet I always stay close to you, and you hold me by the hand. 
19Ps 73:24 You guide me with your instruction and at the end you will receive me with honor. 
19Ps 73:25 What else do I have in heaven but you? Since I have you, what else could I want on earth? 
19Ps 73:26 My mind and my body may grow weak, but God is my strength; he is all I ever need. 
19Ps 73:27 Those who abandon you will certainly perish; you will destroy those who are unfaithful to you. 
19Ps 73:28 But as for me, how wonderful to be near God, to find protection with the Sovereign LORD and to proclaim all that he has done! 
19Ps 74:1 Why have you abandoned us like this, O God? Will you be angry with your own people forever? 
19Ps 74:2 Remember your people, whom you chose for yourself long ago, whom you brought out of slavery to be your own tribe. Remember Mount Zion, where once you lived. 
19Ps 74:3 Walk over these total ruins; our enemies have destroyed everything in the Temple. 
19Ps 74:4 Your enemies have shouted in triumph in your Temple; they have placed their flags there as signs of victory. 
19Ps 74:5 They looked like woodsmen cutting down trees with their axes. 
19Ps 74:6 They smashed all the wooden panels with their axes and sledge hammers. 
19Ps 74:7 They wrecked your Temple and set it on fire; they desecrated the place where you are worshiped. 
19Ps 74:8 They wanted to crush us completely; they burned down every holy place in the land. 
19Ps 74:9 All our sacred symbols are gone; there are no prophets left, and no one knows how long this will last. 
19Ps 74:10 How long, O God, will our enemies laugh at you? Will they insult your name forever? 
19Ps 74:11 Why have you refused to help us? Why do you keep your hands behind you? 
19Ps 74:12 But you have been our king from the beginning, O God; you have saved us many times. 
19Ps 74:13 With your mighty strength you divided the sea and smashed the heads of the sea monsters; 
19Ps 74:14 you crushed the heads of the monster Leviathan and fed his body to desert animals. 
19Ps 74:15 You made springs and fountains flow; you dried up large rivers. 
19Ps 74:16 You created the day and the night; you set the sun and the moon in their places; 
19Ps 74:17 you set the limits of the earth; you made summer and winter. 
19Ps 74:18 But remember, O LORD, that your enemies laugh at you, that they are godless and despise you. 
19Ps 74:19 Don't abandon your helpless people to their cruel enemies; don't forget your persecuted people! 
19Ps 74:20 Remember the covenant you made with us. There is violence in every dark corner of the land. 
19Ps 74:21 Don't let the oppressed be put to shame; let those poor and needy people praise you. 
19Ps 74:22 Rouse yourself, God, and defend your cause! Remember that godless people laugh at you all day long. 
19Ps 74:23 Don't forget the angry shouts of your enemies, the continuous noise made by your foes. 
19Ps 75:1 We give thanks to you, O God, we give thanks to you! We proclaim how great you are and tell of the wonderful things you have done. 
19Ps 75:2 "I have set a time for judgment," says God, "and I will judge with fairness. 
19Ps 75:3 Though every living creature tremble and the earth itself be shaken, I will keep its foundations firm. 
19Ps 75:4 I tell the wicked not to be arrogant; 
19Ps 75:5 I tell them to stop their boasting." 
19Ps 75:6 Judgment does not come from the east or from the west, from the north or from the south; 
19Ps 75:7 it is God who is the judge, condemning some and acquitting others. 
19Ps 75:8 The LORD holds a cup in his hand, filled with the strong wine of his anger. He pours it out, and all the wicked drink it; they drink it down to the last drop. 
19Ps 75:9 But I will never stop speaking of the God of Jacob or singing praises to him. 
19Ps 75:10 He will break the power of the wicked, but the power of the righteous will be increased. 
19Ps 76:1 God is known in Judah; his name is honored in Israel. 
19Ps 76:2 He has his home in Jerusalem; he lives on Mount Zion. 
19Ps 76:3 There he broke the arrows of the enemy, their shields and swords, yes, all their weapons. 
19Ps 76:4 How glorious you are, O God! How majestic, as you return from the mountains where you defeated your foes. 
19Ps 76:5 Their brave soldiers have been stripped of all they had and now are sleeping the sleep of death; all their strength and skill was useless. 
19Ps 76:6 When you threatened them, O God of Jacob, the horses and their riders fell dead. 
19Ps 76:7 But you, LORD, are feared by all. No one can stand in your presence when you are angry. 
19Ps 76:8 You made your judgment known from heaven; the world was afraid and kept silent, 
19Ps 76:9 when you rose up to pronounce judgment, to save all the oppressed on earth. 
19Ps 76:10 Human anger only results in more praise for you; those who survive the wars will keep your festivals. 
19Ps 76:11 Give the LORD your God what you promised him; bring gifts to him, all you nearby nations. God makes everyone fear him; 
19Ps 76:12 he humbles proud princes and terrifies great kings. 
19Ps 77:1 I cry aloud to God; I cry aloud, and he hears me. 
19Ps 77:2 In times of trouble I pray to the Lord; all night long I lift my hands in prayer, but I cannot find comfort. 
19Ps 77:3 When I think of God, I sigh; when I meditate, I feel discouraged. 
19Ps 77:4 He keeps me awake all night; I am so worried that I cannot speak. 
19Ps 77:5 I think of days gone by and remember years of long ago. 
19Ps 77:6 I spend the night in deep thought; I meditate, and this is what I ask myself�� 
19Ps 77:7 "Will the Lord always reject us? Will he never again be pleased with us? 
19Ps 77:8 Has he stopped loving us? Does his promise no longer stand? 
19Ps 77:9 Has God forgotten to be merciful? Has anger taken the place of his compassion?" 
19Ps 77:10 Then I said, "What hurts me most is this - that God is no longer powerful." 
19Ps 77:11 I will remember your great deeds, LORD; I will recall the wonders you did in the past. 
19Ps 77:12 I will think about all that you have done; I will meditate on all your mighty acts. 
19Ps 77:13 Everything you do, O God, is holy. No god is as great as you. 
19Ps 77:14 You are the God who works miracles; you showed your might among the nations. 
19Ps 77:15 By your power you saved your people, the descendants of Jacob and of Joseph. 
19Ps 77:16 When the waters saw you, O God, they were afraid, and the depths of the sea trembled. 
19Ps 77:17 The clouds poured down rain; thunder crashed from the sky, and lightning flashed in all directions. 
19Ps 77:18 The crash of your thunder rolled out, and flashes of lightning lit up the world; the earth trembled and shook. 
19Ps 77:19 You walked through the waves; you crossed the deep sea, but your footprints could not be seen. 
19Ps 77:20 You led your people like a shepherd, with Moses and Aaron in charge. 
19Ps 78:1 Listen, my people, to my teaching, and pay attention to what I say. 
19Ps 78:2 I am going to use wise sayings and explain mysteries from the past, 
19Ps 78:3 things we have heard and known, things that our ancestors told us. 
19Ps 78:4 We will not keep them from our children; we will tell the next generation about the LORD's power and his great deeds and the wonderful things he has done. 
19Ps 78:5 He gave laws to the people of Israel and commandments to the descendants of Jacob. He instructed our ancestors to teach his laws to their children, 
19Ps 78:6 so that the next generation might learn them and in turn should tell their children. 
19Ps 78:7 In this way they also will put their trust in God and not forget what he has done, but always obey his commandments. 
19Ps 78:8 They will not be like their ancestors, a rebellious and disobedient people, whose trust in God was never firm and who did not remain faithful to him. 
19Ps 78:9 The Ephraimites, armed with bows and arrows, ran away on the day of battle. 
19Ps 78:10 They did not keep their covenant with God; they refused to obey his law. 
19Ps 78:11 They forgot what he had done, the miracles they had seen him perform. 
19Ps 78:12 While their ancestors watched, God performed miracles in the plain of Zoan in the land of Egypt. 
19Ps 78:13 He divided the sea and took them through it; he made the waters stand like walls. 
19Ps 78:14 By day he led them with a cloud and all night long with the light of a fire. 
19Ps 78:15 He split rocks open in the desert and gave them water from the depths. 
19Ps 78:16 He caused a stream to come out of the rock and made water flow like a river. 
19Ps 78:17 But they continued to sin against God, and in the desert they rebelled against the Most High. 
19Ps 78:18 They deliberately put God to the test by demanding the food they wanted. 
19Ps 78:19 They spoke against God and said, "Can God supply food in the desert? 
19Ps 78:20 It is true that he struck the rock, and water flowed out in a torrent; but can he also provide us with bread and give his people meat?" 
19Ps 78:21 And so the LORD was angry when he heard them; he attacked his people with fire, and his anger against them grew, 
19Ps 78:22 because they had no faith in him and did not believe that he would save them. 
19Ps 78:23 But he spoke to the sky above and commanded its doors to open; 
19Ps 78:24 he gave them grain from heaven, by sending down manna for them to eat. 
19Ps 78:25 So they ate the food of angels, and God gave them all they wanted. 
19Ps 78:26 He also caused the east wind to blow, and by his power he stirred up the south wind; 
19Ps 78:27 and to his people he sent down birds, as many as the grains of sand on the shore; 
19Ps 78:28 they fell in the middle of the camp all around the tents. 
19Ps 78:29 So the people ate and were satisfied; God gave them what they wanted. 
19Ps 78:30 But they had not yet satisfied their craving and were still eating, 
19Ps 78:31 when God became angry with them and killed their strongest men, the best young men of Israel. 
19Ps 78:32 In spite of all this the people kept sinning; in spite of his miracles they did not trust him. 
19Ps 78:33 So he ended their days like a breath and their lives with sudden disaster. 
19Ps 78:34 Whenever he killed some of them, the rest would turn to him; they would repent and pray earnestly to him. 
19Ps 78:35 They remembered that God was their protector, that the Almighty came to their aid. 
19Ps 78:36 But their words were all lies; nothing they said was sincere. 
19Ps 78:37 They were not loyal to him; they were not faithful to their covenant with him. 
19Ps 78:38 But God was merciful to his people. He forgave their sin and did not destroy them. Many times he held back his anger and restrained his fury. 
19Ps 78:39 He remembered that they were only mortal beings, like a wind that blows by and is gone. 
19Ps 78:40 How often they rebelled against him in the desert; how many times they made him sad! 
19Ps 78:41 Again and again they put God to the test and brought pain to the Holy God of Israel. 
19Ps 78:42 They forgot his great power and the day when he saved them from their enemies 
19Ps 78:43 and performed his mighty acts and miracles in the plain of Zoan in the land of Egypt. 
19Ps 78:44 He turned the rivers into blood, and the Egyptians had no water to drink. 
19Ps 78:45 He sent flies among them, that tormented them, and frogs that ruined their land. 
19Ps 78:46 He sent locusts to eat their crops and to destroy their fields. 
19Ps 78:47 He killed their grapevines with hail and their fig trees with frost. 
19Ps 78:48 He killed their cattle with hail and their flocks with lightning. 
19Ps 78:49 He caused them great distress by pouring out his anger and fierce rage, which came as messengers of death. 
19Ps 78:50 He did not restrain his anger or spare their lives, but killed them with a plague. 
19Ps 78:51 He killed the first-born sons of all the families of Egypt. 
19Ps 78:52 Then he led his people out like a shepherd and guided them through the desert. 
19Ps 78:53 He led them safely, and they were not afraid; but the sea came rolling over their enemies. 
19Ps 78:54 He brought them to his holy land, to the mountains which he himself conquered. 
19Ps 78:55 He drove out the inhabitants as his people advanced; he divided their land among the tribes of Israel and gave their homes to his people. 
19Ps 78:56 But they rebelled against Almighty God and put him to the test. They did not obey his commandments, 
19Ps 78:57 but were rebellious and disloyal like their ancestors, unreliable as a crooked arrow. 
19Ps 78:58 They angered him with their heathen places of worship, and with their idols they made him furious. 
19Ps 78:59 God was angry when he saw it, so he rejected his people completely. 
19Ps 78:60 He abandoned his tent in Shiloh, the home where he had lived among us. 
19Ps 78:61 He allowed our enemies to capture the Covenant Box, the symbol of his power and glory. 
19Ps 78:62 He was angry with his own people and let them be killed by their enemies. 
19Ps 78:63 Young men were killed in war, and young women had no one to marry. 
19Ps 78:64 Priests died by violence, and their widows were not allowed to mourn. 
19Ps 78:65 At last the Lord woke up as though from sleep; he was like a strong man excited by wine. 
19Ps 78:66 He drove his enemies back in lasting and shameful defeat. 
19Ps 78:67 But he rejected the descendants of Joseph; he did not select the tribe of Ephraim. 
19Ps 78:68 Instead he chose the tribe of Judah and Mount Zion, which he dearly loves. 
19Ps 78:69 There he built his Temple like his home in heaven; he made it firm like the earth itself, secure for all time. 
19Ps 78:70 He chose his servant David; he took him from the pastures, 
19Ps 78:71 where he looked after his flocks, and he made him king of Israel, the shepherd of the people of God. 
19Ps 78:72 David took care of them with unselfish devotion and led them with skill. 
19Ps 79:1 O God, the heathen have invaded your land. They have desecrated your holy Temple and left Jerusalem in ruins. 
19Ps 79:2 They left the bodies of your people for the vultures, the bodies of your servants for wild animals to eat. 
19Ps 79:3 They shed your people's blood like water; blood flowed like water all through Jerusalem, and no one was left to bury the dead. 
19Ps 79:4 The surrounding nations insult us; they laugh at us and mock us. 
19Ps 79:5 LORD, will you be angry with us forever? Will your anger continue to burn like fire? 
19Ps 79:6 Turn your anger on the nations that do not worship you, on the people who do not pray to you. 
19Ps 79:7 For they have killed your people; they have ruined your country. 
19Ps 79:8 Do not punish us for the sins of our ancestors. Have mercy on us now; we have lost all hope. 
19Ps 79:9 Help us, O God, and save us; rescue us and forgive our sins for the sake of your own honor. 
19Ps 79:10 Why should the nations ask us, "Where is your God?" Let us see you punish the nations for shedding the blood of your servants. 
19Ps 79:11 Listen to the groans of the prisoners, and by your great power free those who are condemned to die. 
19Ps 79:12 Lord, pay the other nations back seven times for all the insults they have hurled at you. 
19Ps 79:13 Then we, your people, the sheep of your flock, will thank you forever and praise you for all time to come. 
19Ps 80:1 Listen to us, O Shepherd of Israel; hear us, leader of your flock. Seated on your throne above the winged creatures, 
19Ps 80:2 reveal yourself to the tribes of Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh. Show us your strength; come and save us! 
19Ps 80:3 Bring us back, O God! Show us your mercy, and we will be saved! 
19Ps 80:4 How much longer, LORD God Almighty, will you be angry with your people's prayers? 
19Ps 80:5 You have given us sorrow to eat, a large cup of tears to drink. 
19Ps 80:6 You let the surrounding nations fight over our land; our enemies insult us. 
19Ps 80:7 Bring us back, Almighty God! Show us your mercy, and we will be saved! 
19Ps 80:8 You brought a grapevine out of Egypt; you drove out other nations and planted it in their land. 
19Ps 80:9 You cleared a place for it to grow; its roots went deep, and it spread out over the whole land. 
19Ps 80:10 It covered the hills with its shade; its branches overshadowed the giant cedars. 
19Ps 80:11 It extended its branches to the Mediterranean Sea and as far as the Euphrates River. 
19Ps 80:12 Why did you break down the fences around it? Now anyone passing by can steal its grapes; 
19Ps 80:13 wild hogs trample it down, and wild animals feed on it. 
19Ps 80:14 Turn to us, Almighty God! Look down from heaven at us; come and save your people! 
19Ps 80:15 Come and save this grapevine that you planted, this young vine you made grow so strong! 
19Ps 80:16 Our enemies have set it on fire and cut it down; look at them in anger and destroy them! 
19Ps 80:17 Preserve and protect the people you have chosen, the nation you made so strong. 
19Ps 80:18 We will never turn away from you again; keep us alive, and we will praise you. 
19Ps 80:19 Bring us back, LORD God Almighty. Show us your mercy, and we will be saved. 
19Ps 81:1 Shout for joy to God our defender; sing praise to the God of Jacob! 
19Ps 81:2 Start the music and beat the tambourines; play pleasant music on the harps and the lyres. 
19Ps 81:3 Blow the trumpet for the festival, when the moon is new and when the moon is full. 
19Ps 81:4 This is the law in Israel, an order from the God of Jacob. 
19Ps 81:5 He gave it to the people of Israel when he attacked the land of Egypt. I hear an unknown voice saying, 
19Ps 81:6 "I took the burdens off your backs; I let you put down your loads of bricks. 
19Ps 81:7 When you were in trouble, you called to me, and I saved you. From my hiding place in the storm, I answered you. I put you to the test at the springs of Meribah. 
19Ps 81:8 Listen, my people, to my warning; Israel, how I wish you would listen to me! 
19Ps 81:9 You must never worship another god. 
19Ps 81:10 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of Egypt. Open your mouth, and I will feed you. 
19Ps 81:11 "But my people would not listen to me; Israel would not obey me. 
19Ps 81:12 So I let them go their stubborn ways and do whatever they wanted. 
19Ps 81:13 How I wish my people would listen to me; how I wish they would obey me! 
19Ps 81:14 I would quickly defeat their enemies and conquer all their foes. 
19Ps 81:15 Those who hate me would bow in fear before me; their punishment would last forever. 
19Ps 81:16 But I would feed you with the finest wheat and satisfy you with wild honey." 
19Ps 82:1 God presides in the heavenly council; in the assembly of the gods he gives his decision�� 
19Ps 82:2 "You must stop judging unjustly; you must no longer be partial to the wicked! 
19Ps 82:3 Defend the rights of the poor and the orphans; be fair to the needy and the helpless. 
19Ps 82:4 Rescue them from the power of evil people. 
19Ps 82:5 "How ignorant you are! How stupid! You are completely corrupt, and justice has disappeared from the world. 
19Ps 82:6 'You are gods,' I said; 'all of you are children of the Most High.' 
19Ps 82:7 But you will die like mortals; your life will end like that of any prince." 
19Ps 82:8 Come, O God, and rule the world; all the nations are yours. 
19Ps 83:1 O God, do not keep silent; do not be still, do not be quiet! 
19Ps 83:2 Look! Your enemies are in revolt, and those who hate you are rebelling. 
19Ps 83:3 They are making secret plans against your people; they are plotting against those you protect. 
19Ps 83:4 "Come," they say, "let us destroy their nation, so that Israel will be forgotten forever." 
19Ps 83:5 They agree on their plan and form an alliance against you�� 
19Ps 83:6 the people of Edom and the Ishmaelites; the people of Moab and the Hagrites; 
19Ps 83:7 the people of Gebal, Ammon, and Amalek, and of Philistia and Tyre. 
19Ps 83:8 Assyria has also joined them as a strong ally of the Ammonites and Moabites, the descendants of Lot. 
19Ps 83:9 Do to them what you did to the Midianites, and to Sisera and Jabin at the Kishon River. 
19Ps 83:10 You defeated them at Endor, and their bodies rotted on the ground. 
19Ps 83:11 Do to their leaders what you did to Oreb and Zeeb; defeat all their rulers as you did Zebah and Zalmunna, 
19Ps 83:12 who said, "We will take for our own the land that belongs to God." 
19Ps 83:13 Scatter them like dust, O God, like straw blown away by the wind. 
19Ps 83:14 As fire burns the forest, as flames set the hills on fire, 
19Ps 83:15 chase them away with your storm and terrify them with your fierce winds. 
19Ps 83:16 Cover their faces with shame, O LORD, and make them acknowledge your power. 
19Ps 83:17 May they be defeated and terrified forever; may they die in complete disgrace. 
19Ps 83:18 May they know that you alone are the LORD, supreme ruler over all the earth. 
19Ps 84:1 How I love your Temple, LORD Almighty! 
19Ps 84:2 How I want to be there! I long to be in the LORD's Temple. With my whole being I sing for joy to the living God. 
19Ps 84:3 Even the sparrows have built a nest, and the swallows have their own home; they keep their young near your altars, LORD Almighty, my king and my God. 
19Ps 84:4 How happy are those who live in your Temple, always singing praise to you. 
19Ps 84:5 How happy are those whose strength comes from you, who are eager to make the pilgrimage to Mount Zion. 
19Ps 84:6 As they pass through the dry valley of Baca, it becomes a place of springs; the autumn rain fills it with pools. 
19Ps 84:7 They grow stronger as they go; they will see the God of gods on Zion. 
19Ps 84:8 Hear my prayer, LORD God Almighty. Listen, O God of Jacob! 
19Ps 84:9 Bless our king, O God, the king you have chosen. 
19Ps 84:10 One day spent in your Temple is better than a thousand anywhere else; I would rather stand at the gate of the house of my God than live in the homes of the wicked. 
19Ps 84:11 The LORD is our protector and glorious king, blessing us with kindness and honor. He does not refuse any good thing to those who do what is right. 
19Ps 84:12 LORD Almighty, how happy are those who trust in you! 
19Ps 85:1 LORD, you have been merciful to your land; you have made Israel prosperous again. 
19Ps 85:2 You have forgiven your people's sins and pardoned all their wrongs. 
19Ps 85:3 You stopped being angry with them and held back your furious rage. 
19Ps 85:4 Bring us back, O God our savior, and stop being displeased with us! 
19Ps 85:5 Will you be angry with us forever? Will your anger never cease? 
19Ps 85:6 Make us strong again, and we, your people, will praise you. 
19Ps 85:7 Show us your constant love, O LORD, and give us your saving help. 
19Ps 85:8 I am listening to what the LORD God is saying; he promises peace to us, his own people, if we do not go back to our foolish ways. 
19Ps 85:9 Surely he is ready to save those who honor him, and his saving presence will remain in our land. 
19Ps 85:10 Love and faithfulness will meet; righteousness and peace will embrace.

19Ps 85:12 The LORD will make us prosperous, and our land will produce rich harvests. 
19Ps 85:13 Righteousness will go before the LORD and prepare the path for him. 
19Ps 86:1 Listen to me, LORD, and answer me, for I am helpless and weak. 
19Ps 86:2 Save me from death, because I am loyal to you; save me, for I am your servant and I trust in you. 
19Ps 86:3 You are my God, so be merciful to me; I pray to you all day long. 
19Ps 86:4 Make your servant glad, O Lord, because my prayers go up to you. 
19Ps 86:5 You are good to us and forgiving, full of constant love for all who pray to you. 
19Ps 86:6 Listen, LORD, to my prayer; hear my cries for help. 
19Ps 86:7 I call to you in times of trouble, because you answer my prayers. 
19Ps 86:8 There is no god like you, O Lord, not one has done what you have done. 
19Ps 86:9 All the nations that you have created will come and bow down to you; they will praise your greatness. 
19Ps 86:10 You are mighty and do wonderful things; you alone are God. 
19Ps 86:11 Teach me, LORD, what you want me to do, and I will obey you faithfully; teach me to serve you with complete devotion. 
19Ps 86:12 I will praise you with all my heart, O Lord my God; I will proclaim your greatness forever. 
19Ps 86:13 How great is your constant love for me! You have saved me from the grave itself. 
19Ps 86:14 Proud people are coming against me, O God; a cruel gang is trying to kill me - people who pay no attention to you. 
19Ps 86:15 But you, O Lord, are a merciful and loving God, always patient, always kind and faithful. 
19Ps 86:16 Turn to me and have mercy on me; strengthen me and save me, because I serve you just as my mother did. 
19Ps 86:17 Show me proof of your goodness, LORD; those who hate me will be ashamed when they see that you have given me comfort and help. 
19Ps 87:1 The LORD built his city on the sacred hill; 
19Ps 87:2 more than any other place in Israel he loves the city of Jerusalem. 
19Ps 87:3 Listen, city of God, to the wonderful things he says about you�� 
19Ps 87:4 "I will include Egypt and Babylonia when I list the nations that obey me; the people of Philistia, Tyre, and Ethiopia I will number among the inhabitants of Jerusalem." 
19Ps 87:5 Of Zion it will be said that all nations belong there and that the Almighty will make her strong. 
19Ps 87:6 The LORD will write a list of the peoples and include them all as citizens of Jerusalem. 
19Ps 87:7 They dance and sing, "In Zion is the source of all our blessings." 
19Ps 88:1 LORD God, my savior, I cry out all day, and at night I come before you. 
19Ps 88:2 Hear my prayer; listen to my cry for help! 
19Ps 88:3 So many troubles have fallen on me that I am close to death. 
19Ps 88:4 I am like all others who are about to die; all my strength is gone. 
19Ps 88:5 I am abandoned among the dead; I am like the slain lying in their graves, those you have forgotten completely, who are beyond your help. 
19Ps 88:6 You have thrown me into the depths of the tomb, into the darkest and deepest pit. 
19Ps 88:7 Your anger lies heavy on me, and I am crushed beneath its waves. 
19Ps 88:8 You have caused my friends to abandon me; you have made me repulsive to them. I am closed in and cannot escape; 
19Ps 88:9 my eyes are weak from suffering. LORD, every day I call to you and lift my hands to you in prayer. 
19Ps 88:10 Do you perform miracles for the dead? Do they rise up and praise you? 
19Ps 88:11 Is your constant love spoken of in the grave or your faithfulness in the place of destruction? 
19Ps 88:12 Are your miracles seen in that place of darkness or your goodness in the land of the forgotten? 
19Ps 88:13 LORD, I call to you for help; every morning I pray to you. 
19Ps 88:14 Why do you reject me, LORD? Why do you turn away from me? 
19Ps 88:15 Ever since I was young, I have suffered and been near death; I am worn out from the burden of your punishments. 
19Ps 88:16 Your furious anger crushes me; your terrible attacks destroy me. 
19Ps 88:17 All day long they surround me like a flood; they close in on me from every side. 
19Ps 88:18 You have made even my closest friends abandon me, and darkness is my only companion. 
19Ps 89:1 O LORD, I will always sing of your constant love; I will proclaim your faithfulness forever. 
19Ps 89:2 I know that your love will last for all time, that your faithfulness is as permanent as the sky. 
19Ps 89:3 You said, "I have made a covenant with the man I chose; I have promised my servant David, 
19Ps 89:4 'A descendant of yours will always be king; I will preserve your dynasty forever.' " 
19Ps 89:5 The heavens sing of the wonderful things you do; the holy ones sing of your faithfulness, LORD. 
19Ps 89:6 No one in heaven is like you, LORD; none of the heavenly beings is your equal. 
19Ps 89:7 You are feared in the council of the holy ones; they all stand in awe of you. 
19Ps 89:8 LORD God Almighty, none is as mighty as you; in all things you are faithful, O LORD. 
19Ps 89:9 You rule over the powerful sea; you calm its angry waves. 
19Ps 89:10 You crushed the monster Rahab and killed it; with your mighty strength you defeated your enemies. 
19Ps 89:11 Heaven is yours, the earth also; you made the world and everything in it. 
19Ps 89:12 You created the north and the south; Mount Tabor and Mount Hermon sing to you for joy. 
19Ps 89:13 How powerful you are! How great is your strength! 
19Ps 89:14 Your kingdom is founded on righteousness and justice; love and faithfulness are shown in all you do. 
19Ps 89:15 How happy are the people who worship you with songs, who live in the light of your kindness! 
19Ps 89:16 Because of you they rejoice all day long, and they praise you for your goodness. 
19Ps 89:17 You give us great victories; in your love you make us triumphant. 
19Ps 89:18 You, O LORD, chose our protector; you, the Holy God of Israel, gave us our king. 
19Ps 89:19 In a vision long ago you said to your faithful servants, "I have given help to a famous soldier; I have given the throne to one I chose from the people. 
19Ps 89:20 I have made my servant David king by anointing him with holy oil. 
19Ps 89:21 My strength will always be with him, my power will make him strong. 
19Ps 89:22 His enemies will never succeed against him; the wicked will not defeat him. 
19Ps 89:23 I will crush his foes and kill everyone who hates him. 
19Ps 89:24 I will love him and be loyal to him; I will make him always victorious. 
19Ps 89:25 I will extend his kingdom from the Mediterranean to the Euphrates River. 
19Ps 89:26 He will say to me, 'You are my father and my God; you are my protector and savior.' 
19Ps 89:27 I will make him my first-born son, the greatest of all kings. 
19Ps 89:28 I will always keep my promise to him, and my covenant with him will last forever. 
19Ps 89:29 His dynasty will be as permanent as the sky; a descendant of his will always be king. 
19Ps 89:30 "But if his descendants disobey my law and do not live according to my commands, 
19Ps 89:31 if they disregard my instructions and do not keep my commandments, 
19Ps 89:32 then I will punish them for their sins; I will make them suffer for their wrongs. 
19Ps 89:33 But I will not stop loving David or fail to keep my promise to him. 
19Ps 89:34 I will not break my covenant with him or take back even one promise I made him. 
19Ps 89:35 "Once and for all I have promised by my holy name�� I will never lie to David. 
19Ps 89:36 He will always have descendants, and I will watch over his kingdom as long as the sun shines. 
19Ps 89:37 It will be as permanent as the moon, that faithful witness in the sky." 
19Ps 89:38 But you are angry with your chosen king; you have deserted and rejected him. 
19Ps 89:39 You have broken your covenant with your servant and thrown his crown in the dirt. 
19Ps 89:40 You have torn down the walls of his city and left his forts in ruins. 
19Ps 89:41 All who pass by steal his belongings; all his neighbors laugh at him. 
19Ps 89:42 You have given the victory to his enemies; you have made them all happy. 
19Ps 89:43 You have made his weapons useless and let him be defeated in battle. 
19Ps 89:44 You have taken away his royal scepter and knocked his throne to the ground. 
19Ps 89:45 You have made him old before his time and covered him with disgrace. 
19Ps 89:46 LORD, will you hide yourself forever? How long will your anger burn like fire? 
19Ps 89:47 Remember how short my life is; remember that you created all of us mortal! 
19Ps 89:48 Who can live and never die? How can we humans keep ourselves from the grave? 
19Ps 89:49 Lord, where are the former proofs of your love? Where are the promises you made to David? 
19Ps 89:50 Don't forget how I, your servant, am insulted, how I endure all the curses of the heathen. 
19Ps 89:51 Your enemies insult your chosen king, O LORD! They insult him wherever he goes. 
19Ps 89:52 Praise the LORD forever! Amen! Amen! 
19Ps 90:1 O Lord, you have always been our home. 
19Ps 90:2 Before you created the hills or brought the world into being, you were eternally God, and will be God forever. 
19Ps 90:3 You tell us to return to what we were; you change us back to dust. 
19Ps 90:4 A thousand years to you are like one day; they are like yesterday, already gone, like a short hour in the night. 
19Ps 90:5 You carry us away like a flood; we last no longer than a dream. We are like weeds that sprout in the morning, 
19Ps 90:6 that grow and burst into bloom, then dry up and die in the evening. 
19Ps 90:7 We are destroyed by your anger; we are terrified by your fury. 
19Ps 90:8 You place our sins before you, our secret sins where you can see them. 
19Ps 90:9 Our life is cut short by your anger; it fades away like a whisper. 
19Ps 90:10 Seventy years is all we have - eighty years, if we are strong; yet all they bring us is trouble and sorrow; life is soon over, and we are gone. 
19Ps 90:11 Who has felt the full power of your anger? Who knows what fear your fury can bring? 
19Ps 90:12 Teach us how short our life is, so that we may become wise. 
19Ps 90:13 How much longer will your anger last? Have pity, O LORD, on your servants! 
19Ps 90:14 Fill us each morning with your constant love, so that we may sing and be glad all our life. 
19Ps 90:15 Give us now as much happiness as the sadness you gave us during all our years of misery. 
19Ps 90:16 Let us, your servants, see your mighty deeds; let our descendants see your glorious might. 
19Ps 90:17 Lord our God, may your blessings be with us. Give us success in all we do! 
19Ps 91:1 Whoever goes to the LORD for safety, whoever remains under the protection of the Almighty, 
19Ps 91:2 can say to him, "You are my defender and protector. You are my God; in you I trust." 
19Ps 91:3 He will keep you safe from all hidden dangers and from all deadly diseases. 
19Ps 91:4 He will cover you with his wings; you will be safe in his care; his faithfulness will protect and defend you. 
19Ps 91:5 You need not fear any dangers at night or sudden attacks during the day 
19Ps 91:6 or the plagues that strike in the dark or the evils that kill in daylight. 
19Ps 91:7 A thousand may fall dead beside you, ten thousand all around you, but you will not be harmed. 
19Ps 91:8 You will look and see how the wicked are punished. 
19Ps 91:9 You have made the LORD your defender, the Most High your protector, 
19Ps 91:10 and so no disaster will strike you, no violence will come near your home. 
19Ps 91:11 God will put his angels in charge of you to protect you wherever you go. 
19Ps 91:12 They will hold you up with their hands to keep you from hurting your feet on the stones. 
19Ps 91:13 You will trample down lions and snakes, fierce lions and poisonous snakes. 
19Ps 91:14 God says, "I will save those who love me and will protect those who acknowledge me as LORD. 
19Ps 91:15 When they call to me, I will answer them; when they are in trouble, I will be with them. I will rescue them and honor them. 
19Ps 91:16 I will reward them with long life; I will save them." 
19Ps 92:1 How good it is to give thanks to you, O LORD, to sing in your honor, O Most High God, 
19Ps 92:2 to proclaim your constant love every morning and your faithfulness every night, 
19Ps 92:3 with the music of stringed instruments and with melody on the harp. 
19Ps 92:4 Your mighty deeds, O LORD, make me glad; because of what you have done, I sing for joy. 
19Ps 92:5 How great are your actions, LORD! How deep are your thoughts! 
19Ps 92:6 This is something a fool cannot know; someone who is stupid cannot understand�� 
19Ps 92:7 the wicked may grow like weeds, those who do wrong may prosper; yet they will be totally destroyed, 
19Ps 92:8 because you, LORD, are supreme forever. 
19Ps 92:9 We know that your enemies will die, and all the wicked will be defeated. 
19Ps 92:10 You have made me as strong as a wild ox; you have blessed me with happiness. 
19Ps 92:11 I have seen the defeat of my enemies and heard the cries of the wicked. 
19Ps 92:12 The righteous will flourish like palm trees; they will grow like the cedars of Lebanon. 
19Ps 92:13 They are like trees planted in the house of the LORD, that flourish in the Temple of our God, 
19Ps 92:14 that still bear fruit in old age and are always green and strong. 
19Ps 92:15 This shows that the LORD is just, that there is no wrong in my protector. 
19Ps 93:1 The LORD is king. He is clothed with majesty and strength. The earth is set firmly in place and cannot be moved. 
19Ps 93:2 Your throne, O LORD, has been firm from the beginning, and you existed before time began. 
19Ps 93:3 The ocean depths raise their voice, O LORD; they raise their voice and roar. 
19Ps 93:4 The LORD rules supreme in heaven, greater than the roar of the ocean, more powerful than the waves of the sea. 
19Ps 93:5 Your laws are eternal, LORD, and your Temple is holy indeed, forever and ever. 
19Ps 94:1 LORD, you are a God who punishes; reveal your anger! 
19Ps 94:2 You are the judge of us all; rise and give the proud what they deserve! 
19Ps 94:3 How much longer will the wicked be glad? How much longer, LORD? 
19Ps 94:4 How much longer will criminals be proud and boast about their crimes? 
19Ps 94:5 They crush your people, LORD; they oppress those who belong to you. 
19Ps 94:6 They kill widows and orphans, and murder the strangers who live in our land. 
19Ps 94:7 They say, "The LORD does not see us; the God of Israel does not notice." 
19Ps 94:8 My people, how can you be such stupid fools? When will you ever learn? 
19Ps 94:9 God made our ears - can't he hear? He made our eyes - can't he see? 
19Ps 94:10 He scolds the nations - won't he punish them? He is the teacher of us all - hasn't he any knowledge? 
19Ps 94:11 The LORD knows what we think; he knows how senseless our reasoning is. 
19Ps 94:12 LORD, how happy are those you instruct, the ones to whom you teach your law! 
19Ps 94:13 You give them rest from days of trouble until a pit is dug to trap the wicked. 
19Ps 94:14 The LORD will not abandon his people; he will not desert those who belong to him. 
19Ps 94:15 Justice will again be found in the courts, and all righteous people will support it. 
19Ps 94:16 Who stood up for me against the wicked? Who took my side against the evildoers? 
19Ps 94:17 If the LORD had not helped me, I would have gone quickly to the land of silence. 
19Ps 94:18 I said, "I am falling"; but your constant love, O LORD, held me up. 
19Ps 94:19 Whenever I am anxious and worried, you comfort me and make me glad. 
19Ps 94:20 You have nothing to do with corrupt judges, who make injustice legal, 
19Ps 94:21 who plot against good people and sentence the innocent to death. 
19Ps 94:22 But the LORD defends me; my God protects me. 
19Ps 94:23 He will punish them for their wickedness and destroy them for their sins; the LORD our God will destroy them. 
19Ps 95:1 Come, let us praise the LORD! Let us sing for joy to God, who protects us! 
19Ps 95:2 Let us come before him with thanksgiving and sing joyful songs of praise. 
19Ps 95:3 For the LORD is a mighty God, a mighty king over all the gods. 
19Ps 95:4 He rules over the whole earth, from the deepest caves to the highest hills. 
19Ps 95:5 He rules over the sea, which he made; the land also, which he himself formed. 
19Ps 95:6 Come, let us bow down and worship him; let us kneel before the LORD, our Maker! 
19Ps 95:7 He is our God; we are the people he cares for, the flock for which he provides. Listen today to what he says�� 
19Ps 95:8 "Don't be stubborn, as your ancestors were at Meribah, as they were that day in the desert at Massah. 
19Ps 95:9 There they put me to the test and tried me, although they had seen what I did for them. 
19Ps 95:10 For forty years I was disgusted with those people. I said, 'How disloyal they are! They refuse to obey my commands.' 
19Ps 95:11 I was angry and made a solemn promise�� 'You will never enter the land where I would have given you rest.' " 
19Ps 96:1 Sing a new song to the LORD! Sing to the LORD, all the world! 
19Ps 96:2 Sing to the LORD, and praise him! Proclaim every day the good news that he has saved us. 
19Ps 96:3 Proclaim his glory to the nations, his mighty deeds to all peoples. 
19Ps 96:4 The LORD is great and is to be highly praised; he is to be honored more than all the gods.

19Ps 104:1 O LORD, my God, how great you are! You are clothed with majesty and glory; 
19Ps 104:2 you cover yourself with light. You have spread out the heavens like a tent 
19Ps 104:3 and built your home on the waters above. You use the clouds as your chariot and ride on the wings of the wind. 
19Ps 104:4 You use the winds as your messengers and flashes of lightning as your servants. 
19Ps 104:5 You have set the earth firmly on its foundations, and it will never be moved. 
19Ps 104:6 You placed the ocean over it like a robe, and the water covered the mountains. 
19Ps 104:7 When you rebuked the waters, they fled; they rushed away when they heard your shout of command. 
19Ps 104:8 They flowed over the mountains and into the valleys, to the place you had made for them. 
19Ps 104:9 You set a boundary they can never pass, to keep them from covering the earth again.

19Ps 104:16 The cedars of Lebanon get plenty of rain - the LORD's own trees, which he planted. 
19Ps 104:17 There the birds build their nests; the storks nest in the fir trees. 
19Ps 104:18 The wild goats live in the high mountains, and the rock badgers hide in the cliffs. 
19Ps 104:19 You created the moon to mark the months; the sun knows the time to set. 
19Ps 104:20 You made the night, and in the darkness all the wild animals come out. 
19Ps 104:21 The young lions roar while they hunt, looking for the food that God provides. 
19Ps 104:22 When the sun rises, they go back and lie down in their dens. 
19Ps 104:23 Then people go out to do their work and keep working until evening. 
19Ps 104:24 LORD, you have made so many things! How wisely you made them all! The earth is filled with your creatures. 
19Ps 104:25 There is the ocean, large and wide, where countless creatures live, large and small alike. 
19Ps 104:26 The ships sail on it, and in it plays Leviathan, that sea monster which you made. 
19Ps 104:27 All of them depend on you to give them food when they need it. 
19Ps 104:28 You give it to them, and they eat it; you provide food, and they are satisfied. 
19Ps 104:29 When you turn away, they are afraid; when you take away your breath, they die and go back to the dust from which they came. 
19Ps 104:30 But when you give them breath, they are created; you give new life to the earth. 
19Ps 104:31 May the glory of the LORD last forever! May the LORD be happy with what he has made!

19Ps 105:5 You descendants of Abraham, his servant; you descendants of Jacob, the man he chose�� 
19Ps 105:6 remember the miracles that God performed and the judgments that he gave. 
19Ps 105:7 The LORD is our God; his commands are for all the world. 
19Ps 105:8 He will keep his covenant forever, his promises for a thousand generations. 
19Ps 105:9 He will keep the agreement he made with Abraham and his promise to Isaac. 
19Ps 105:10 The LORD made a covenant with Jacob, one that will last forever. 
19Ps 105:11 "I will give you the land of Canaan," he said. "It will be your own possession." 
19Ps 105:12 God's people were few in number, strangers in the land of Canaan. 
19Ps 105:13 They wandered from country to country, from one kingdom to another. 
19Ps 105:14 But God let no one oppress them; to protect them, he warned the kings�� 
19Ps 105:15 "Don't harm my chosen servants; do not touch my prophets." 
19Ps 105:16 The LORD sent famine to their country and took away all their food. 
19Ps 105:17 But he sent a man ahead of them, Joseph, who had been sold as a slave. 
19Ps 105:18 His feet were kept in chains, and an iron collar was around his neck, 
19Ps 105:19 until what he had predicted came true. The word of the LORD proved him right. 
19Ps 105:20 Then the king of Egypt had him released; the ruler of nations set him free. 
19Ps 105:21 He put him in charge of his government and made him ruler over all the land, 
19Ps 105:22 with power over the king's officials and authority to instruct his advisers. 
19Ps 105:23 Then Jacob went to Egypt and settled in that country. 
19Ps 105:24 The LORD gave many children to his people and made them stronger than their enemies. 
19Ps 105:25 He made the Egyptians hate his people and treat his servants with deceit. 
19Ps 105:26 Then he sent his servant Moses, and Aaron, whom he had chosen. 
19Ps 105:27 They did God's mighty acts and performed miracles in Egypt. 
19Ps 105:28 God sent darkness on the country, but the Egyptians did not obey his command. 
19Ps 105:29 He turned their rivers into blood and killed all their fish. 
19Ps 105:30 Their country was overrun with frogs; even the palace was filled with them. 
19Ps 105:31 God commanded, and flies and gnats swarmed throughout the whole country. 
19Ps 105:32 He sent hail and lightning on their land instead of rain; 
19Ps 105:33 he destroyed their grapevines and fig trees and broke down all the trees. 
19Ps 105:34 He commanded, and the locusts came, countless millions of them; 
19Ps 105:35 they ate all the plants in the land; they ate all the crops. 
19Ps 105:36 He killed the first-born sons of all the families of Egypt. 
19Ps 105:37 Then he led the Israelites out; they carried silver and gold, and all of them were healthy and strong. 
19Ps 105:38 The Egyptians were afraid of them and were glad when they left. 
19Ps 105:39 God put a cloud over his people and a fire at night to give them light. 
19Ps 105:40 They asked, and he sent quails; he gave them food from heaven to satisfy them. 
19Ps 105:41 He opened a rock, and water gushed out, flowing through the desert like a river. 
19Ps 105:42 He remembered his sacred promise to Abraham his servant. 
19Ps 105:43 So he led his chosen people out, and they sang and shouted for joy. 
19Ps 105:44 He gave them the lands of other peoples and let them take over their fields, 
19Ps 105:45 so that his people would obey his laws and keep all his commands. Praise the LORD! 
19Ps 106:1 Praise the LORD! Give thanks to the LORD, because he is good; his love is eternal. 
19Ps 106:2 Who can tell all the great things he has done? Who can praise him enough? 
19Ps 106:3 Happy are those who obey his commands, who always do what is right. 
19Ps 106:4 Remember me, LORD, when you help your people; include me when you save them. 
19Ps 106:5 Let me see the prosperity of your people and share in the happiness of your nation, in the glad pride of those who belong to you. 
19Ps 106:6 We have sinned as our ancestors did; we have been wicked and evil. 
19Ps 106:7 Our ancestors in Egypt did not understand God's wonderful acts; they forgot the many times he showed them his love, and they rebelled against the Almighty at the Red Sea. 
19Ps 106:8 But he saved them, as he had promised, in order to show his great power. 
19Ps 106:9 He gave a command to the Red Sea, and it dried up; he led his people across on dry land. 
19Ps 106:10 He saved them from those who hated them; he rescued them from their enemies. 
19Ps 106:11 But the water drowned their enemies; not one of them was left. 
19Ps 106:12 Then his people believed his promises and sang praises to him. 
19Ps 106:13 But they quickly forgot what he had done and acted without waiting for his advice. 
19Ps 106:14 They were filled with craving in the desert and put God to the test; 
19Ps 106:15 so he gave them what they asked for, but also sent a terrible disease among them. 
19Ps 106:16 There in the desert they were jealous of Moses and of Aaron, the LORD's holy servant. 
19Ps 106:17 Then the earth opened up and swallowed Dathan and buried Abiram and his family; 
19Ps 106:18 fire came down on their followers and burned up those wicked people. 
19Ps 106:19 They made a gold bull-calf at Sinai and worshiped that idol; 
19Ps 106:20 they exchanged the glory of God for the image of an animal that eats grass. 
19Ps 106:21 They forgot the God who had saved them by his mighty acts in Egypt. 
19Ps 106:22 What wonderful things he did there! What amazing things at the Red Sea! 
19Ps 106:23 When God said that he would destroy his people, his chosen servant, Moses, stood up against God and kept his anger from destroying them. 
19Ps 106:24 Then they rejected the pleasant land, because they did not believe God's promise. 
19Ps 106:25 They stayed in their tents and grumbled and would not listen to the LORD. 
19Ps 106:26 So he have them a solomn warning that he would make them die in the desert 
19Ps 106:27 and scatter their descendants among the heathen, letting them die in foreign countries. 
19Ps 106:28 Then at Peor, God's people joined in the worship of Baal and ate sacrifices offered to dead gods. 
19Ps 106:29 They stirred up the LORD's anger by their actions, and a terrible disease broke out among them. 
19Ps 106:30 But Phinehas stood up and punished the guilty, and the plague was stopped. 
19Ps 106:31 This has been remembered in his favor ever since and will be for all time to come. 
19Ps 106:32 At the springs of Meribah the people made the LORD angry, and Moses was in trouble on their account. 
19Ps 106:33 They made him so bitter that he spoke without stopping to think. 
19Ps 106:34 They did not kill the heathen, as the LORD had commanded them to do, 
19Ps 106:35 but they intermarried with them and adopted their pagan ways. 
19Ps 106:36 God's people worshiped idols, and this caused their destruction. 
19Ps 106:37 They offered their own sons and daughters as sacrifices to the idols of Canaan. 
19Ps 106:38 They killed those innocent children, and the land was defiled by those murders. 
19Ps 106:39 They made themselves impure by their actions and were unfaithful to God. 
19Ps 106:40 So the LORD was angry with his people; he was disgusted with them. 
19Ps 106:41 He abandoned them to the power of the heathen, and their enemies ruled over them. 
19Ps 106:42 They were oppressed by their enemies and were in complete subjection to them. 
19Ps 106:43 Many times the LORD rescued his people, but they chose to rebel against him and sank deeper into sin. 
19Ps 106:44 Yet the LORD heard them when they cried out, and he took notice of their distress. 
19Ps 106:45 For their sake he remembered his covenant, and because of his great love he relented. 
19Ps 106:46 He made all their oppressors feel sorry for them. 
19Ps 106:47 Save us, O LORD our God, and bring us back from among the nations, so that we may be thankful and praise your holy name. 
19Ps 106:48 Praise the LORD, the God of Israel; praise him now and forever! Let everyone say, "Amen!" Praise the LORD! 
19Ps 107:1 "Give thanks to the LORD, because he is good; his love is eternal!" 
19Ps 107:2 Repeat these words in praise to the LORD, all you whom he has saved. He has rescued you from your enemies 
19Ps 107:3 and has brought you back from foreign countries, from east and west, from north and south. 
19Ps 107:4 Some wandered in the trackless desert and could not find their way to a city to live in. 
19Ps 107:5 They were hungry and thirsty and had given up all hope. 
19Ps 107:6 Then in their trouble they called to the LORD, and he saved them from their distress. 
19Ps 107:7 He led them by a straight road to a city where they could live. 
19Ps 107:8 They must thank the LORD for his constant love, for the wonderful things he did for them. 
19Ps 107:9 He satisfies those who are thirsty and fills the hungry with good things. 
19Ps 107:10 Some were living in gloom and darkness, prisoners suffering in chains, 
19Ps 107:11 because they had rebelled against the commands of Almighty God and had rejected his instructions. 
19Ps 107:12 They were worn out from hard work; they would fall down, and no one would help. 
19Ps 107:13 Then in their trouble they called to the LORD, and he saved them from their distress. 
19Ps 107:14 He brought them out of their gloom and darkness and broke their chains in pieces. 
19Ps 107:15 They must thank the LORD for his constant love, for the wonderful things he did for them. 
19Ps 107:16 He breaks down doors of bronze and smashes iron bars. 
19Ps 107:17 Some were fools, suffering because of their sins and because of their evil; 
19Ps 107:18 they couldn't stand the sight of food and were close to death. 
19Ps 107:19 Then in their trouble they called to the LORD, and he saved them from their distress. 
19Ps 107:20 He healed them with his command and saved them from the grave. 
19Ps 107:21 They must thank the LORD for his constant love, for the wonderful things he did for them. 
19Ps 107:22 They must thank him with sacrifices, and with songs of joy must tell all that he has done. 
19Ps 107:23 Some sailed over the ocean in ships, earning their living on the seas. 
19Ps 107:24 They saw what the LORD can do, his wonderful acts on the seas. 
19Ps 107:25 He commanded, and a mighty wind began to blow and stirred up the waves. 
19Ps 107:26 The ships were lifted high in the air and plunged down into the depths. In such danger the sailors lost their courage; 
19Ps 107:27 they stumbled and staggered like drunks - all their skill was useless. 
19Ps 107:28 Then in their trouble they called to the LORD, and he saved them from their distress. 
19Ps 107:29 He calmed the raging storm, and the waves became quiet. 
19Ps 107:30 They were glad because of the calm, and he brought them safe to the port they wanted.

19Ps 132:15 I will richly provide Zion with all she needs; I will satisfy her poor with food. 
19Ps 132:16 I will bless her priests in all they do, and her people will sing and shout for joy.

19Ps 139:21 O LORD, how I hate those who hate you! How I despise those who rebel against you! 
19Ps 139:22 I hate them with a total hatred; I regard them as my enemies. 
19Ps 139:23 Examine me, O God, and know my mind; test me, and discover my thoughts. 
19Ps 139:24 Find out if there is any evil in me and guide me in the everlasting way. 
19Ps 140:1 Save me, LORD, from evildoers; keep me safe from violent people. 
19Ps 140:2 They are always plotting evil, always stirring up quarrels. 
19Ps 140:3 Their tongues are like deadly snakes; their words are like a cobra's poison. 
19Ps 140:4 Protect me, LORD, from the power of the wicked; keep me safe from violent people who plot my downfall.

19Ps 140:8 LORD, don't give the wicked what they want; don't let their plots succeed. 
19Ps 140:9 Don't let my enemies be victorious; make their threats against me fall back on them. 
19Ps 140:10 May red-hot coals fall on them; may they be thrown into a pit and never get out. 
19Ps 140:11 May those who accuse others falsely not succeed; may evil overtake violent people and destroy them. 
19Ps 140:12 LORD, I know that you defend the cause of the poor and the rights of the needy. 
19Ps 140:13 The righteous will praise you indeed; they will live in your presence. 
19Ps 141:1 I call to you, LORD; help me now! Listen to me when I call to you.

19Ps 141:3 LORD, place a guard at my mouth, a sentry at the door of my lips.

19Ps 141:6 When their rulers are thrown down from rocky cliffs, the people will admit that my words were true. 
19Ps 141:7 Like wood that is split and chopped into bits, so their bones are scattered at the edge of the grave. 
19Ps 141:8 But I keep trusting in you, my Sovereign LORD. I seek your protection; don't let me die! 
19Ps 141:9 Protect me from the traps they have set for me, from the snares of those evildoers. 
19Ps 141:10 May the wicked fall into their own traps while I go by unharmed. 
19Ps 142:1 I call to the LORD for help; I plead with him. 
19Ps 142:2 I bring him all my complaints; I tell him all my troubles. 
19Ps 142:3 When I am ready to give up, he knows what I should do. In the path where I walk, my enemies have hidden a trap for me. 
19Ps 142:4 When I look beside me, I see that there is no one to help me, no one to protect me. No one cares for me. 
19Ps 142:5 LORD, I cry to you for help; you, LORD, are my protector; you are all I want in this life. 
19Ps 142:6 Listen to my cry for help, for I am sunk in despair. Save me from my enemies; they are too strong for me. 
19Ps 142:7 Set me free from my distress; then in the assembly of your people I will praise you because of your goodness to me.

19Ps 143:2 Don't put me, your servant, on trial; no one is innocent in your sight. 
19Ps 143:3 My enemies have hunted me down and completely defeated me. They have put me in a dark prison, and I am like those who died long ago.

19Ps 143:5 I remember the days gone by; I think about all that you have done, I bring to mind all your deeds. 
19Ps 143:6 I lift up my hands to you in prayer; like dry ground my soul is thirsty for you. 
19Ps 143:7 Answer me now, LORD! I have lost all hope. Don't hide yourself from me, or I will be among those who go down to the world of the dead.

19Ps 144:1 Praise the LORD, my protector! He trains me for battle and prepares me for war. 
19Ps 144:2 He is my protector and defender, my shelter and savior, in whom I trust for safety. He subdues the nations under me. 
19Ps 144:3 LORD, what are mortals, that you notice them; mere mortals, that you pay attention to us? 
19Ps 144:4 We are like a puff of wind; our days are like a passing shadow. 
19Ps 144:5 O LORD, tear the sky open and come down; touch the mountains, and they will pour out smoke. 
19Ps 144:6 Send flashes of lightning and scatter your enemies; shoot your arrows and send them running. 
19Ps 144:7 Reach down from above, pull me out of the deep water, and rescue me; save me from the power of foreigners, 
19Ps 144:8 who never tell the truth and lie even under oath. 
19Ps 144:9 I will sing you a new song, O God; I will play the harp and sing to you. 
19Ps 144:10 You give victory to kings and rescue your servant David. 
19Ps 144:11 Save me from my cruel enemies; rescue me from the power of foreigners, who never tell the truth and lie even under oath. 
19Ps 144:12 May our sons in their youth be like plants that grow up strong. May our daughters be like stately columns which adorn the corners of a palace. 
19Ps 144:13 May our barns be filled with crops of every kind. May the sheep in our fields bear young by the tens of thousands. 
19Ps 144:14 May our cattle reproduce plentifully without miscarriage or loss. May there be no cries of distress in our streets.

19Ps 146:5 Happy are those who have the God of Jacob to help them and who depend on the LORD their God, 
19Ps 146:6 the Creator of heaven, earth, and sea, and all that is in them. He always keeps his promises;

20Pr 1:1 The proverbs of Solomon, son of David and king of Israel. 
20Pr 1:2 Here are proverbs that will help you recognize wisdom and good advice, and understand sayings with deep meaning. 
20Pr 1:3 They can teach you how to live intelligently and how to be honest, just, and fair. 
20Pr 1:4 They can make an inexperienced person clever and teach young people how to be resourceful. 
20Pr 1:5 These proverbs can even add to the knowledge of the wise and give guidance to the educated, 
20Pr 1:6 so that they can understand the hidden meanings of proverbs and the problems that the wise raise. 
20Pr 1:7 To have knowledge, you must first have reverence for the LORD. Stupid people have no respect for wisdom and refuse to learn. 
20Pr 1:8 My child, pay attention to what your father and mother tell you. 
20Pr 1:9 Their teaching will improve your character as a handsome turban or a necklace improves your appearance. 
20Pr 1:10 My child, when sinners tempt you, don't give in. 
20Pr 1:11 Suppose they say, "Come on; let's find someone to kill! Let's attack some innocent people for the fun of it! 
20Pr 1:12 They may be alive and well when we find them, but they'll be dead when we're through with them! 
20Pr 1:13 We'll find all kinds of riches and fill our houses with loot! 
20Pr 1:14 Come and join us, and we'll all share what we steal." 
20Pr 1:15 My child, don't go with people like that. Stay away from them. 
20Pr 1:16 They can't wait to do something bad. They're always ready to kill. 
20Pr 1:17 It does no good to spread a net when the bird you want to catch is watching, 
20Pr 1:18 but people like that are setting a trap for themselves, a trap in which they will die. 
20Pr 1:19 Robbery always claims the life of the robber - this is what happens to anyone who lives by violence. 
20Pr 1:20 Listen! Wisdom is calling out in the streets and marketplaces, 
20Pr 1:21 calling loudly at the city gates and wherever people come together�� 
20Pr 1:22 "Foolish people! How long do you want to be foolish? How long will you enjoy making fun of knowledge? Will you never learn? 
20Pr 1:23 Listen when I reprimand you; I will give you good advice and share my knowledge with you. 
20Pr 1:24 I have been calling you, inviting you to come, but you would not listen. You paid no attention to me. 
20Pr 1:25 You have ignored all my advice and have not been willing to let me correct you. 
20Pr 1:26 So when you get into trouble, I will laugh at you. I will make fun of you when terror strikes - 
20Pr 1:27 when it comes on you like a storm, bringing fierce winds of trouble, and you are in pain and misery. 
20Pr 1:28 Then you will call for wisdom, but I will not answer. You may look for me everywhere, but you will not find me. 
20Pr 1:29 You have never had any use for knowledge and have always refused to obey the LORD. 
20Pr 1:30 You have never wanted my advice or paid any attention when I corrected you. 
20Pr 1:31 So then, you will get what you deserve, and your own actions will make you sick. 
20Pr 1:32 Inexperienced people die because they reject wisdom. Stupid people are destroyed by their own lack of concern. 
20Pr 1:33 But whoever listens to me will have security. He will be safe, with no reason to be afraid." 
20Pr 2:1 My child, learn what I teach you and never forget what I tell you to do. 
20Pr 2:2 Listen to what is wise and try to understand it. 
20Pr 2:3 Yes, beg for knowledge; plead for insight. 
20Pr 2:4 Look for it as hard as you would for silver or some hidden treasure. 
20Pr 2:5 If you do, you will know what it means to fear the LORD and you will succeed in learning about God. 
20Pr 2:6 It is the LORD who gives wisdom; from him come knowledge and understanding. 
20Pr 2:7 He provides help and protection for those who are righteous and honest. 
20Pr 2:8 He protects those who treat others fairly, and guards those who are devoted to him. 
20Pr 2:9 If you listen to me, you will know what is right, just, and fair. You will know what you should do. 
20Pr 2:10 You will become wise, and your knowledge will give you pleasure. 
20Pr 2:11 Your insight and understanding will protect you 
20Pr 2:12 and prevent you from doing the wrong thing. They will keep you away from people who stir up trouble by what they say - 
20Pr 2:13 those who have abandoned a righteous life to live in the darkness of sin, 
20Pr 2:14 those who find pleasure in doing wrong and who enjoy senseless evil, 
20Pr 2:15 unreliable people who cannot be trusted. 
20Pr 2:16 You will be able to resist any immoral woman who tries to seduce you with her smooth talk, 
20Pr 2:17 who is faithless to her own husband and forgets her sacred vows. 
20Pr 2:18 If you go to her house, you are traveling the road to death. To go there is to approach the world of the dead. 
20Pr 2:19 No one who visits her ever comes back. He never returns to the road to life. 
20Pr 2:20 So you must follow the example of good people and live a righteous life. 
20Pr 2:21 Righteous people - people of integrity - will live in this land of ours. 
20Pr 2:22 But God will snatch the wicked from the land and pull sinners out of it like plants from the ground. 
20Pr 3:1 My child, don't forget what I teach you. Always remember what I tell you to do. 
20Pr 3:2 My teaching will give you a long and prosperous life. 
20Pr 3:3 Never let go of loyalty and faithfulness. Tie them around your neck; write them on your heart. 
20Pr 3:4 If you do this, both God and people will be pleased with you. 
20Pr 3:5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart. Never rely on what you think you know. 
20Pr 3:6 Remember the LORD in everything you do, and he will show you the right way. 
20Pr 3:7 Never let yourself think that you are wiser than you are; simply obey the LORD and refuse to do wrong. 
20Pr 3:8 If you do, it will be like good medicine, healing your wounds and easing your pains. 
20Pr 3:9 Honor the LORD by making him an offering from the best of all that your land produces. 
20Pr 3:10 If you do, your barns will be filled with grain, and you will have too much wine to store it all. 
20Pr 3:11 My child, when the LORD corrects you, pay close attention and take it as a warning. 
20Pr 3:12 The LORD corrects those he loves, as parents correct a child of whom they are proud. 
20Pr 3:13 Happy is anyone who becomes wise - who comes to have understanding. 
20Pr 3:14 There is more profit in it than there is in silver; it is worth more to you than gold. 
20Pr 3:15 Wisdom is more valuable than jewels; nothing you could want can compare with it. 
20Pr 3:16 Wisdom offers you long life, as well as wealth and honor. 
20Pr 3:17 Wisdom can make your life pleasant and lead you safely through it. 
20Pr 3:18 Those who become wise are happy; wisdom will give them life. 
20Pr 3:19 The LORD created the earth by his wisdom; by his knowledge he set the sky in place. 
20Pr 3:20 His wisdom caused the rivers to flow and the clouds to give rain to the earth. 
20Pr 3:21 My child, hold on to your wisdom and insight. Never let them get away from you. 
20Pr 3:22 They will provide you with life - a pleasant and happy life. 
20Pr 3:23 You can go safely on your way and never even stumble. 
20Pr 3:24 You will not be afraid when you go to bed, and you will sleep soundly through the night. 
20Pr 3:25 You will not have to worry about sudden disasters, such as come on the wicked like a storm. 
20Pr 3:26 The LORD will keep you safe. He will not let you fall into a trap. 
20Pr 3:27 Whenever you possibly can, do good to those who need it. 
20Pr 3:28 Never tell your neighbors to wait until tomorrow if you can help them now. 
20Pr 3:29 Don't plan anything that will hurt your neighbors; they live beside you, trusting you. 
20Pr 3:30 Don't argue with others for no reason when they have never done you any harm. 
20Pr 3:31 Don't be jealous of violent people or decide to act as they do, 
20Pr 3:32 because the LORD hates people who do evil, but he takes righteous people into his confidence. 
20Pr 3:33 The LORD puts a curse on the homes of the wicked, but blesses the homes of the righteous. 
20Pr 3:34 He has no use for conceited people, but shows favor to those who are humble. 
20Pr 3:35 Wise people will gain an honorable reputation, but stupid people will only add to their own disgrace. 
20Pr 4:1 My children, listen to what your father teaches you. Pay attention, and you will have understanding. 
20Pr 4:2 What I am teaching you is good, so remember it all. 
20Pr 4:3 When I was only a little boy, my parents' only son, 
20Pr 4:4 my father would teach me. He would say, "Remember what I say and never forget it. Do as I tell you, and you will live. 
20Pr 4:5 Get wisdom and insight! Do not forget or ignore what I say. 
20Pr 4:6 Do not abandon wisdom, and she will protect you; love her, and she will keep you safe. 
20Pr 4:7 Getting wisdom is the most important thing you can do. Whatever else you get, get insight. 
20Pr 4:8 Love wisdom, and she will make you great. Embrace her, and she will bring you honor. 
20Pr 4:9 She will be your crowning glory." 
20Pr 4:10 Listen to me, my child. Take seriously what I am telling you, and you will live a long life. 
20Pr 4:11 I have taught you wisdom and the right way to live. 
20Pr 4:12 Nothing will stand in your way if you walk wisely, and you will not stumble when you run. 
20Pr 4:13 Always remember what you have learned. Your education is your life - guard it well. 
20Pr 4:14 Do not go where evil people go. Do not follow the example of the wicked. 
20Pr 4:15 Don't do it! Keep away from evil! Refuse it and go on your way. 
20Pr 4:16 Wicked people cannot sleep unless they have done something wrong. They lie awake unless they have hurt someone. 
20Pr 4:17 Wickedness and violence are like food and drink to them. 
20Pr 4:18 The road the righteous travel is like the sunrise, getting brighter and brighter until daylight has come. 
20Pr 4:19 The road of the wicked, however, is dark as night. They fall, but cannot see what they have stumbled over. 
20Pr 4:20 My child, pay attention to what I say. Listen to my words. 
20Pr 4:21 Never let them get away from you. Remember them and keep them in your heart. 
20Pr 4:22 They will give life and health to anyone who understands them. 
20Pr 4:23 Be careful how you think; your life is shaped by your thoughts. 
20Pr 4:24 Never say anything that isn't true. Have nothing to do with lies and misleading words. 
20Pr 4:25 Look straight ahead with honest confidence; don't hang your head in shame. 
20Pr 4:26 Plan carefully what you do, and whatever you do will turn out right. 
20Pr 4:27 Avoid evil and walk straight ahead. Don't go one step off the right way. 
20Pr 5:1 My child, pay attention and listen to my wisdom and insight. 
20Pr 5:2 Then you will know how to behave properly, and your words will show that you have knowledge. 
20Pr 5:3 The lips of another man's wife may be as sweet as honey and her kisses as smooth as olive oil, 
20Pr 5:4 but when it is all over, she leaves you nothing but bitterness and pain. 
20Pr 5:5 She will take you down to the world of the dead; the road she walks is the road to death. 
20Pr 5:6 She does not stay on the road to life; but wanders off, and does not realize what is happening. 
20Pr 5:7 Now listen to me, sons, and never forget what I am saying. 
20Pr 5:8 Keep away from such a woman! Don't even go near her door! 
20Pr 5:9 If you do, others will gain the respect that you once had, and you will die young at the hands of merciless people. 
20Pr 5:10 Yes, strangers will take all your wealth, and what you have worked for will belong to someone else. 
20Pr 5:11 You will lie groaning on your deathbed, your flesh and muscles being eaten away, 
20Pr 5:12 and you will say, "Why would I never learn? Why would I never let anyone correct me? 
20Pr 5:13 I wouldn't listen to my teachers. I paid no attention to them. 
20Pr 5:14 And suddenly I found myself publicly disgraced." 
20Pr 5:15 Be faithful to your own wife and give your love to her alone. 
20Pr 5:16 Children that you have by other women will do you no good. 
20Pr 5:17 Your children should grow up to help you, not strangers. 
20Pr 5:18 So be happy with your wife and find your joy with the woman you married - 
20Pr 5:19 pretty and graceful as a deer. Let her charms keep you happy; let her surround you with her love. 
20Pr 5:20 Son, why should you give your love to another woman? Why should you prefer the charms of another man's wife? 
20Pr 5:21 The LORD sees everything you do. Wherever you go, he is watching. 
20Pr 5:22 The sins of the wicked are a trap. They get caught in the net of their own sin. 
20Pr 5:23 They die because they have no self-control. Their utter stupidity will send them to their graves. 
20Pr 6:1 My child, have you promised to be responsible for someone else's debts? 
20Pr 6:2 Have you been caught by your own words, trapped by your own promises? 
20Pr 6:3 Well then, my child, you are in that person's power, but this is how to get out of it�� hurry to him, and beg him to release you. 
20Pr 6:4 Don't let yourself go to sleep or even stop to rest. 
20Pr 6:5 Get out of the trap like a bird or a deer escaping from a hunter. 
20Pr 6:6 Lazy people should learn a lesson from the way ants live. 
20Pr 6:7 They have no leader, chief, or ruler, 
20Pr 6:8 but they store up their food during the summer, getting ready for winter. 
20Pr 6:9 How long is the lazy man going to lie around? When is he ever going to get up? 
20Pr 6:10 "I'll just take a short nap," he says; "I'll fold my hands and rest a while." 
20Pr 6:11 But while he sleeps, poverty will attack him like an armed robber. 
20Pr 6:12 Worthless, wicked people go around telling lies. 
20Pr 6:13 They wink and make gestures to deceive you, 
20Pr 6:14 all the while planning evil in their perverted minds, stirring up trouble everywhere. 
20Pr 6:15 Because of this, disaster will strike them without warning, and they will be fatally wounded. 
20Pr 6:16 There are seven things that the LORD hates and cannot tolerate�� 
20Pr 6:17 A proud look, a lying tongue, hands that kill innocent people, 
20Pr 6:18 a mind that thinks up wicked plans, feet that hurry off to do evil, 
20Pr 6:19 a witness who tells one lie after another, and someone who stirs up trouble among friends. 
20Pr 6:20 Son, do what your father tells you and never forget what your mother taught you. 
20Pr 6:21 Keep their words with you always, locked in your heart. 
20Pr 6:22 Their teaching will lead you when you travel, protect you at night, and advise you during the day. 
20Pr 6:23 Their instructions are a shining light; their correction can teach you how to live. 
20Pr 6:24 It can keep you away from bad women, from the seductive words of other men's wives. 
20Pr 6:25 Don't be tempted by their beauty; don't be trapped by their flirting eyes. 
20Pr 6:26 A man can hire a prostitute for the price of a loaf of bread, but adultery will cost him all he has. 
20Pr 6:27 Can you carry fire against your chest without burning your clothes? 
20Pr 6:28 Can you walk on hot coals without burning your feet? 
20Pr 6:29 It is just as dangerous to sleep with another man's wife. Whoever does it will suffer. 
20Pr 6:30 People don't despise a thief if he steals food when he is hungry; 
20Pr 6:31 yet if he is caught, he must pay back seven times more - he must give up everything he has. 
20Pr 6:32 But a man who commits adultery doesn't have any sense. He is just destroying himself. 
20Pr 6:33 He will be dishonored and beaten up; he will be permanently disgraced. 
20Pr 6:34 A husband is never angrier than when he is jealous; his revenge knows no limits. 
20Pr 6:35 He will not accept any payment; no amount of gifts will satisfy his anger. 
20Pr 7:1 My child, remember what I say and never forget what I tell you to do. 
20Pr 7:2 Do what I say, and you will live. Be as careful to follow my teaching as you are to protect your eyes. 
20Pr 7:3 Keep my teaching with you all the time; write it on your heart. 
20Pr 7:4 Treat wisdom as your sister, and insight as your closest friend. 
20Pr 7:5 They will keep you away from other men's wives, from women with seductive words. 
20Pr 7:6 Once I was looking out the window of my house, 
20Pr 7:7 and I saw many inexperienced young men, but noticed one foolish fellow in particular. 
20Pr 7:8 He was walking along the street near the corner where a certain woman lived. He was passing near her house 
20Pr 7:9 in the evening after it was dark. 
20Pr 7:10 And then she met him; she was dressed like a prostitute and was making plans. 
20Pr 7:11 She was a bold and shameless woman who always walked the streets 
20Pr 7:12 or stood waiting at a corner, sometimes in the streets, sometimes in the marketplace. 
20Pr 7:13 She threw her arms around the young man, kissed him, looked him straight in the eye, and said, 
20Pr 7:14 "I made my offerings today and have the meat from the sacrifices. 
20Pr 7:15 So I came out looking for you. I wanted to find you, and here you are! 
20Pr 7:16 I've covered my bed with sheets of colored linen from Egypt. 
20Pr 7:17 I've perfumed it with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 
20Pr 7:18 Come on! Let's make love all night long. We'll be happy in each other's arms. 
20Pr 7:19 My husband isn't at home. He's on a long trip. 
20Pr 7:20 He took plenty of money with him and won't be back for two weeks." 
20Pr 7:21 So she tempted him with her charms, and he gave in to her smooth talk. 
20Pr 7:22 Suddenly he was going with her like an ox on the way to be slaughtered, like a deer prancing into a trap 
20Pr 7:23 where an arrow would pierce its heart. He was like a bird going into a net - he did not know that his life was in danger. 
20Pr 7:24 Now then, sons, listen to me. Pay attention to what I say. 
20Pr 7:25 Do not let such a woman win your heart; don't go wandering after her. 
20Pr 7:26 She has been the ruin of many men and caused the death of too many to count. 
20Pr 7:27 If you go to her house, you are on the way to the world of the dead. It is a shortcut to death. 
20Pr 8:1 Listen! Wisdom is calling out. Reason is making herself heard. 
20Pr 8:2 On the hilltops near the road and at the crossroads she stands. 
20Pr 8:3 At the entrance to the city, beside the gates, she calls�� 
20Pr 8:4 "I appeal to all of you; I call to everyone on earth. 
20Pr 8:5 Are you immature? Learn to be mature. Are you foolish? Learn to have sense. 
20Pr 8:6 Listen to my excellent words; all I tell you is right. 
20Pr 8:7 What I say is the truth; lies are hateful to me. 
20Pr 8:8 Everything I say is true; nothing is false or misleading. 
20Pr 8:9 To those with insight, it is all clear; to the well-informed, it is all plain. 
20Pr 8:10 Choose my instruction instead of silver; choose knowledge rather than the finest gold. 
20Pr 8:11 "I am Wisdom, I am better than jewels; nothing you want can compare with me. 
20Pr 8:12 I am Wisdom, and I have insight; I have knowledge and sound judgment. 
20Pr 8:13 To honor the LORD is to hate evil; I hate pride and arrogance, evil ways and false words. 
20Pr 8:14 I make plans and carry them out. I have understanding, and I am strong. 
20Pr 8:15 I help kings to govern and rulers to make good laws. 
20Pr 8:16 Every ruler on earth governs with my help, officials and nobles alike. 
20Pr 8:17 I love those who love me; whoever looks for me can find me. 
20Pr 8:18 I have riches and honor to give, prosperity and success. 
20Pr 8:19 What you get from me is better than the finest gold, better than the purest silver. 
20Pr 8:20 I walk the way of righteousness; I follow the paths of justice, 
20Pr 8:21 giving wealth to those who love me, filling their houses with treasures. 
20Pr 8:22 "The LORD created me first of all, the first of his works, long ago. 
20Pr 8:23 I was made in the very beginning, at the first, before the world began. 
20Pr 8:24 I was born before the oceans, when there were no springs of water. 
20Pr 8:25 I was born before the mountains, before the hills were set in place, 
20Pr 8:26 before God made the earth and its fields or even the first handful of soil. 
20Pr 8:27 I was there when he set the sky in place, when he stretched the horizon across the ocean, 
20Pr 8:28 when he placed the clouds in the sky, when he opened the springs of the ocean 
20Pr 8:29 and ordered the waters of the sea to rise no further than he said. I was there when he laid the earth's foundations. 
20Pr 8:30 I was beside him like an architect, I was his daily source of joy, always happy in his presence - 
20Pr 8:31 happy with the world and pleased with the human race. 
20Pr 8:32 "Now, young people, listen to me. Do as I say, and you will be happy. 
20Pr 8:33 Listen to what you are taught. Be wise; do not neglect it. 
20Pr 8:34 Those who listen to me will be happy - those who stay at my door every day, waiting at the entrance to my home. 
20Pr 8:35 Those who find me find life, and the LORD will be pleased with them. 
20Pr 8:36 Those who do not find me hurt themselves; anyone who hates me loves death." 
20Pr 9:1 Wisdom has built her house and made seven columns for it. 
20Pr 9:2 She has had an animal killed for a feast, mixed spices in the wine, and set the table. 
20Pr 9:3 She has sent her servant women to call out from the highest place in town�� 
20Pr 9:4 "Come in, ignorant people!" And to the foolish she says, 
20Pr 9:5 "Come, eat my food and drink the wine that I have mixed. 
20Pr 9:6 Leave the company of ignorant people, and live. Follow the way of knowledge." 
20Pr 9:7 If you correct conceited people, you will only be insulted. If you reprimand evil people, you will only get hurt. 
20Pr 9:8 Never correct conceited people; they will hate you for it. But if you correct the wise, they will respect you. 
20Pr 9:9 Anything you say to the wise will make them wiser. Whatever you tell the righteous will add to their knowledge. 
20Pr 9:10 To be wise you must first have reverence for the LORD. If you know the Holy One, you have understanding. 
20Pr 9:11 Wisdom will add years to your life. 
20Pr 9:12 You are the one who will profit if you have wisdom, and if you reject it, you are the one who will suffer. 
20Pr 9:13 Stupidity is like a loud, ignorant, shameless woman. 
20Pr 9:14 She sits at the door of her house or on a seat in the highest part of town, 
20Pr 9:15 and calls out to people passing by, who are minding their own business�� 
20Pr 9:16 "Come in, ignorant people!" To the foolish she says, 
20Pr 9:17 "Stolen water is sweeter. Stolen bread tastes better." 
20Pr 9:18 Her victims do not know that the people die who go to her house, that those who have already entered are now deep in the world of the dead. 
20Pr 10:1 These are Solomon's proverbs�� Wise children make their fathers proud of them; foolish ones bring their mothers grief. 
20Pr 10:2 Wealth you get by dishonesty will do you no good, but honesty can save your life. 
20Pr 10:3 The LORD will not let good people go hungry, but he will keep the wicked from getting what they want.

20Pr 10:7 Good people will be remembered as a blessing, but the wicked will soon be forgotten. 
20Pr 10:8 Sensible people accept good advice. People who talk foolishly will come to ruin. 
20Pr 10:9 Honest people are safe and secure, but the dishonest will be caught. 
20Pr 10:10 Someone who holds back the truth causes trouble, but one who openly criticizes works for peace.

20Pr 10:12 Hate stirs up trouble, but love forgives all offenses. 
20Pr 10:13 Intelligent people talk sense, but stupid people need to be punished. 
20Pr 10:14 The wise get all the knowledge they can, but when fools speak, trouble is not far off. 
20Pr 10:15 Wealth protects the rich; poverty destroys the poor. 
20Pr 10:16 The reward for doing good is life, but sin leads only to more sin. 
20Pr 10:17 People who listen when they are corrected will live, but those who will not admit that they are wrong are in danger. 
20Pr 10:18 Anyone who hides hatred is a liar. Anyone who spreads gossip is a fool. 
20Pr 10:19 The more you talk, the more likely you are to sin. If you are wise, you will keep quiet. 
20Pr 10:20 A good person's words are like pure silver; a wicked person's ideas are worthless. 
20Pr 10:21 A good person's words will benefit many people, but you can kill yourself with stupidity. 
20Pr 10:22 It is the LORD's blessing that makes you wealthy. Hard work can make you no richer. 
20Pr 10:23 It is foolish to enjoy doing wrong. Intelligent people take pleasure in wisdom. 
20Pr 10:24 The righteous get what they want, but the wicked will get what they fear most. 
20Pr 10:25 Storms come, and the wicked are blown away, but honest people are always safe. 
20Pr 10:26 Never get a lazy person to do something for you; he will be as irritating as vinegar on your teeth or smoke in your eyes.

20Pr 10:32 Righteous people know the kind thing to say, but the wicked are always saying things that hurt. 
20Pr 11:1 The LORD hates people who use dishonest scales. He is happy with honest weights. 
20Pr 11:2 People who are proud will soon be disgraced. It is wiser to be modest. 
20Pr 11:3 If you are good, you are guided by honesty. People who can't be trusted are destroyed by their own dishonesty. 
20Pr 11:4 Riches will do you no good on the day you face death, but honesty can save your life. 
20Pr 11:5 Honesty makes a good person's life easier, but the wicked will cause their own downfall. 
20Pr 11:6 Righteousness rescues those who are honest, but those who can't be trusted are trapped by their own greed.

20Pr 11:11 A city becomes great when the righteous give it their blessing; but a city is brought to ruin by the words of the wicked. 
20Pr 11:12 It is foolish to speak scornfully of others. If you are smart, you will keep quiet. 
20Pr 11:13 No one who gossips can be trusted with a secret, but you can put confidence in someone who is trustworthy. 
20Pr 11:14 A nation will fall if it has no guidance. Many advisers mean security. 
20Pr 11:15 If you promise to pay a stranger's debt, you will regret it. You are better off if you don't get involved. 
20Pr 11:16 A gracious woman is respected, but a woman without virtue is a disgrace. Lazy people will never have money, but aggressive people will get rich. 
20Pr 11:17 You do yourself a favor when you are kind. If you are cruel, you only hurt yourself. 
20Pr 11:18 Wicked people do not really gain anything, but if you do what is right, you are certain to be rewarded. 
20Pr 11:19 Anyone who is determined to do right will live, but anyone who insists on doing wrong will die. 
20Pr 11:20 The LORD hates evil-minded people, but loves those who do right. 
20Pr 11:21 You can be sure that evil people will be punished, but the righteous will escape. 
20Pr 11:22 Beauty in a woman without good judgment is like a gold ring in a pig's snout. 
20Pr 11:23 What good people want always results in good; when the wicked get what they want, everyone is angry. 
20Pr 11:24 Some people spend their money freely and still grow richer. Others are cautious, and yet grow poorer. 
20Pr 11:25 Be generous, and you will be prosperous. Help others, and you will be helped.

20Pr 11:27 If your goals are good, you will be respected, but if you are looking for trouble, that is what you will get. 
20Pr 11:28 Those who depend on their wealth will fall like the leaves of autumn, but the righteous will prosper like the leaves of summer. 
20Pr 11:29 Those who bring trouble on their families will have nothing at the end. Foolish people will always be servants to the wise. 
20Pr 11:30 Righteousness gives life, but violence takes it away. 
20Pr 11:31 Those who are good are rewarded here on earth, so you can be sure that wicked and sinful people will be punished.

20Pr 12:3 Wickedness does not give security, but righteous people stand firm. 
20Pr 12:4 A good wife is her husband's pride and joy; but a wife who brings shame on her husband is like a cancer in his bones.

20Pr 12:14 Your reward depends on what you say and what you do; you will get what you deserve. 
20Pr 12:15 Stupid people always think they are right. Wise people listen to advice.

20Pr 12:17 When you tell the truth, justice is done, but lies lead to injustice. 
20Pr 12:18 Thoughtless words can wound as deeply as any sword, but wisely spoken words can heal. 
20Pr 12:19 A lie has a short life, but truth lives on forever. 
20Pr 12:20 Those who plan evil are in for a rude surprise, but those who work for good will find happiness. 
20Pr 12:21 Nothing bad happens to righteous people, but the wicked have nothing but trouble. 
20Pr 12:22 The LORD hates liars, but is pleased with those who keep their word. 
20Pr 12:23 Smart people keep quiet about what they know, but stupid people advertise their ignorance. 
20Pr 12:24 Hard work will give you power; being lazy will make you a slave.

20Pr 13:1 Wise children pay attention when their parents correct them, but arrogant people never admit they are wrong. 
20Pr 13:2 Good people will be rewarded for what they say, but those who are deceitful are hungry for violence. 
20Pr 13:3 Be careful what you say and protect your life. A careless talker destroys himself. 
20Pr 13:4 No matter how much a lazy person may want something, he will never get it. A hard worker will get everything he wants. 
20Pr 13:5 Honest people hate lies, but the words of wicked people are shameful and disgraceful. 
20Pr 13:6 Righteousness protects the innocent; wickedness is the downfall of sinners. 
20Pr 13:7 Some people pretend to be rich, but have nothing. Others pretend to be poor, but own a fortune. 
20Pr 13:8 The rich have to use their money to save their lives, but no one threatens the poor. 
20Pr 13:9 The righteous are like a light shining brightly; the wicked are like a lamp flickering out. 
20Pr 13:10 Arrogance causes nothing but trouble. It is wiser to ask for advice. 
20Pr 13:11 The more easily you get your wealth, the sooner you will lose it. The harder it is to earn, the more you will have. 
20Pr 13:12 When hope is crushed, the heart is crushed, but a wish come true fills you with joy.

20Pr 13:14 The teachings of the wise are a fountain of life; they will help you escape when your life is in danger. 
20Pr 13:15 Intelligence wins respect, but those who can't be trusted are on the road to ruin. 
20Pr 13:16 Sensible people always think before they act, but stupid people advertise their ignorance. 
20Pr 13:17 Unreliable messengers cause trouble, but those who can be trusted bring peace. 
20Pr 13:18 Someone who will not learn will be poor and disgraced. Anyone who listens to correction is respected. 
20Pr 13:19 How good it is to get what you want! Stupid people refuse to turn away from evil. 
20Pr 13:20 Keep company with the wise and you will become wise. If you make friends with stupid people, you will be ruined. 
20Pr 13:21 Trouble follows sinners everywhere, but righteous people will be rewarded with good things.

20Pr 14:6 Conceited people can never become wise, but intelligent people learn easily. 
20Pr 14:7 Stay away from foolish people; they have nothing to teach you. 
20Pr 14:8 Why is a clever person wise? Because he knows what to do. Why is a stupid person foolish? Because he only thinks he knows. 
20Pr 14:9 Foolish people don't care if they sin, but good people want to be forgiven. 
20Pr 14:10 Your joy is your own; your bitterness is your own. No one can share them with you.

20Pr 14:12 What you think is the right road may lead to death. 
20Pr 14:13 Laughter may hide sadness. When happiness is gone, sorrow is always there.

20Pr 23:10 Never move an old property line or take over land owned by orphans. 
20Pr 23:11 The LORD is their powerful defender, and he will argue their case against you. 
20Pr 23:12 Pay attention to your teacher and learn all you can. 
20Pr 23:13 Don't hesitate to discipline children. A good spanking won't kill them. 
20Pr 23:14 As a matter of fact, it may save their lives. 
20Pr 23:15 My child, if you become wise, I will be very happy. 
20Pr 23:16 I will be proud when I hear you speaking words of wisdom. 
20Pr 23:17 Don't be envious of sinful people; let reverence for the LORD be the concern of your life. 
20Pr 23:18 If it is, you have a bright future. 
20Pr 23:19 Listen, my child, be wise and give serious thought to the way you live. 
20Pr 23:20 Don't associate with people who drink too much wine or stuff themselves with food. 
20Pr 23:21 Drunkards and gluttons will be reduced to poverty. If all you do is eat and sleep, you will soon be wearing rags. 
20Pr 23:22 Listen to your father; without him you would not exist. When your mother is old, show her your appreciation. 
20Pr 23:23 Truth, wisdom, learning, and good sense - these are worth paying for, but too valuable for you to sell. 
20Pr 23:24 A righteous person's parents have good reason to be happy. You can take pride in a wise child. 
20Pr 23:25 Let your father and mother be proud of you; give your mother that happiness. 
20Pr 23:26 Pay close attention, son, and let my life be your example. 
20Pr 23:27 Prostitutes and immoral women are a deadly trap. 
20Pr 23:28 They wait for you like robbers and cause many men to be unfaithful. 
20Pr 23:29 Show me people who drink too much, who have to try out fancy drinks, and I will show you people who are miserable and sorry for themselves, always causing trouble and always complaining. 
20Pr 23:30 Their eyes are bloodshot, and they have bruises that could have been avoided. 
20Pr 23:31 Don't let wine tempt you, even though it is rich red, and it sparkles in the cup, and it goes down smoothly. 
20Pr 23:32 The next morning you will feel as if you had been bitten by a poisonous snake. 
20Pr 23:33 Weird sights will appear before your eyes, and you will not be able to think or speak clearly. 
20Pr 23:34 You will feel as if you were out on the ocean, seasick, swinging high up in the rigging of a tossing ship. 
20Pr 23:35 "I must have been hit," you will say; "I must have been beaten up, but I don't remember it. Why can't I wake up? I need another drink." 
20Pr 24:1 Don't be envious of evil people, and don't try to make friends with them. 
20Pr 24:2 Causing trouble is all they ever think about; every time they open their mouth someone is going to be hurt. 
20Pr 24:3 Homes are built on the foundation of wisdom and understanding. 
20Pr 24:4 Where there is knowledge, the rooms are furnished with valuable, beautiful things. 
20Pr 24:5 Being wise is better than being strong; yes, knowledge is more important than strength. 
20Pr 24:6 After all, you must make careful plans before you fight a battle, and the more good advice you get, the more likely you are to win. 
20Pr 24:7 Wise sayings are too deep for stupid people to understand. They have nothing to say when important matters are being discussed. 
20Pr 24:8 If you are always planning evil, you will earn a reputation as a troublemaker. 
20Pr 24:9 Any scheme a fool thinks up is sinful. People hate a person who has nothing but scorn for others. 
20Pr 24:10 If you are weak in a crisis, you are weak indeed. 
20Pr 24:11 Don't hesitate to rescue someone who is about to be executed unjustly. 
20Pr 24:12 You may say that it is none of your business, but God knows and judges your motives. He keeps watch on you; he knows. And he will reward you according to what you do. 
20Pr 24:13 My child, eat honey; it is good. And just as honey from the comb is sweet on your tongue, 
20Pr 24:14 you may be sure that wisdom is good for the soul. Get wisdom and you have a bright future. 
20Pr 24:15 Don't be like the wicked who scheme to rob honest people or to take away their homes. 
20Pr 24:16 No matter how often honest people fall, they always get up again; but disaster destroys the wicked. 
20Pr 24:17 Don't be glad when your enemies meet disaster, and don't rejoice when they stumble. 
20Pr 24:18 The LORD will know if you are gloating, and he will not like it; and then maybe he won't punish them. 
20Pr 24:19 Don't let evil people worry you; don't be envious of them. 
20Pr 24:20 A wicked person has no future - nothing to look forward to. 
20Pr 24:21 Have reverence for the LORD, my child, and honor the king. Have nothing to do with people who rebel against them; 
20Pr 24:22 such people could be ruined in a moment. Do you realize the disaster that God or the king can cause? 
20Pr 24:23 The wise have also said these things�� It is wrong for judges to be prejudiced. 
20Pr 24:24 If they pronounce a guilty person innocent, they will be cursed and hated by everyone. 
20Pr 24:25 Judges who punish the guilty, however, will be prosperous and enjoy a good reputation. 
20Pr 24:26 An honest answer is a sign of true friendship. 
20Pr 24:27 Don't build your house and establish a home until your fields are ready, and you are sure that you can earn a living. 
20Pr 24:28 Don't give evidence against others without good reason, or say misleading things about them. 
20Pr 24:29 Don't say, "I'll do to them just what they did to me! I'll get even with them!" 
20Pr 24:30 I walked through the fields and vineyards of a lazy, stupid person. 
20Pr 24:31 They were full of thorn bushes and overgrown with weeds. The stone wall around them had fallen down. 
20Pr 24:32 I looked at this, thought about it, and learned a lesson from it�� 
20Pr 24:33 Go ahead and take your nap; go ahead and sleep. Fold your hands and rest awhile, 
20Pr 24:34 but while you are asleep, poverty will attack you like an armed robber. 
20Pr 25:1 Here are more of Solomon's proverbs, copied by scribes at the court of King Hezekiah of Judah. 
20Pr 25:2 We honor God for what he conceals; we honor kings for what they explain. 
20Pr 25:3 You never know what a king is thinking; his thoughts are beyond us, like the heights of the sky or the depths of the ocean. 
20Pr 25:4 Take the impurities out of silver and the artist can produce a thing of beauty. 
20Pr 25:5 Keep evil advisers away from the king and his government will be known for its justice. 
20Pr 25:6 When you stand before the king, don't try to impress him and pretend to be important. 
20Pr 25:7 It is better to be asked to take a higher position than to be told to give your place to someone more important. 
20Pr 25:8 Don't be too quick to go to court about something you have seen. If another witness later proves you wrong, what will you do then? 
20Pr 25:9 If you and your neighbor have a difference of opinion, settle it between yourselves and do not reveal any secrets. 
20Pr 25:10 Otherwise everyone will learn that you can't keep a secret, and you will never live down the shame. 
20Pr 25:11 An idea well-expressed is like a design of gold, set in silver. 
20Pr 25:12 A warning given by an experienced person to someone willing to listen is more valuable than gold rings or jewelry made of the finest gold. 
20Pr 25:13 A reliable messenger is refreshing to the one who sends him, like cold water in the heat of harvest time. 
20Pr 25:14 People who promise things that they never give are like clouds and wind that bring no rain. 
20Pr 25:15 Patient persuasion can break down the strongest resistance and can even convince rulers. 
20Pr 25:16 Never eat more honey than you need; too much may make you vomit. 
20Pr 25:17 Don't visit your neighbors too often; they may get tired of you and come to hate you. 
20Pr 25:18 A false accusation is as deadly as a sword, a club, or a sharp arrow. 
20Pr 25:19 Depending on an unreliable person in a crisis is like trying to chew with a loose tooth or walk with a crippled foot. 
20Pr 25:20 Singing to a person who is depressed is like taking off a person's clothes on a cold day or like rubbing salt in a wound. 
20Pr 25:21 If your enemies are hungry, feed them; if they are thirsty, give them a drink. 
20Pr 25:22 You will make them burn with shame, and the LORD will reward you. 
20Pr 25:23 Gossip brings anger just as surely as the north wind brings rain. 
20Pr 25:24 Better to live on the roof than share the house with a nagging wife. 
20Pr 25:25 Finally hearing good news from a distant land is like a drink of cold water when you are dry and thirsty. 
20Pr 25:26 A good person who gives in to someone who is evil reminds you of a polluted spring or a poisoned well. 
20Pr 25:27 Too much honey is bad for you, and so is trying to win too much praise. 
20Pr 25:28 If you cannot control your anger, you are as helpless as a city without walls, open to attack. 
20Pr 26:1 Praise for a fool is out of place, like snow in summer or rain at harvest time. 
20Pr 26:2 Curses cannot hurt you unless you deserve them. They are like birds that fly by and never light. 
20Pr 26:3 You have to whip a horse, you have to bridle a donkey, and you have to beat a fool. 
20Pr 26:4 If you answer a silly question, you are just as silly as the person who asked it. 
20Pr 26:5 Give a silly answer to a silly question, and the one who asked it will realize that he's not as smart as he thinks. 
20Pr 26:6 If you let a fool deliver a message, you might as well cut off your own feet; you are asking for trouble. 
20Pr 26:7 A fool can use a proverb about as well as crippled people can use their legs. 
20Pr 26:8 Praising someone who is stupid makes as much sense as tying a stone in a sling. 
20Pr 26:9 A fool quoting a wise saying reminds you of a drunk trying to pick a thorn out of his hand. 
20Pr 26:10 An employer who hires any fool that comes along is only hurting everybody concerned. 
20Pr 26:11 A fool doing some stupid thing a second time is like a dog going back to its vomit. 
20Pr 26:12 The most stupid fool is better off than those who think they are wise when they are not. 
20Pr 26:13 Why don't lazy people ever get out of the house? What are they afraid of ? Lions? 
20Pr 26:14 Lazy people turn over in bed. They get no farther than a door swinging on its hinges. 
20Pr 26:15 Some people are too lazy to put food in their own mouths. 
20Pr 26:16 A lazy person will think he is smarter than seven men who can give good reasons for their opinions. 
20Pr 26:17 Getting involved in an argument that is none of your business is like going down the street and grabbing a dog by the ears. 
20Pr 26:18 Someone who tricks someone else and then claims 
20Pr 26:19 that he was only joking is like a crazy person playing with a deadly weapon. 
20Pr 26:20 Without wood, a fire goes out; without gossip, quarreling stops. 
20Pr 26:21 Charcoal keeps the embers glowing, wood keeps the fire burning, and troublemakers keep arguments alive. 
20Pr 26:22 Gossip is so tasty! How we love to swallow it! 
20Pr 26:23 Insincere talk that hides what you are really thinking is like a fine glaze on a cheap clay pot. 
20Pr 26:24 A hypocrite hides hate behind flattering words. 
20Pr 26:25 They may sound fine, but don't believe him, because his heart is filled to the brim with hate. 
20Pr 26:26 He may disguise his hatred, but everyone will see the evil things he does. 
20Pr 26:27 People who set traps for others get caught themselves. People who start landslides get crushed. 
20Pr 26:28 You have to hate someone to want to hurt him with lies. Insincere talk brings nothing but ruin. 
20Pr 27:1 Never boast about tomorrow. You don't know what will happen between now and then. 
20Pr 27:2 Let other people praise you - even strangers; never do it yourself. 
20Pr 27:3 The weight of stone and sand is nothing compared to the trouble that stupidity can cause. 
20Pr 27:4 Anger is cruel and destructive, but it is nothing compared to jealousy. 
20Pr 27:5 Better to correct someone openly than to let him think you don't care for him at all. 
20Pr 27:6 Friends mean well, even when they hurt you. But when an enemy puts his arm around your shoulder - watch out! 
20Pr 27:7 When you are full, you will refuse honey, but when you are hungry, even bitter food tastes sweet. 
20Pr 27:8 Anyone away from home is like a bird away from its nest. 
20Pr 27:9 Perfume and fragrant oils make you feel happier, but trouble shatters your peace of mind. 
20Pr 27:10 Do not forget your friends or your father's friends. If you are in trouble, don't ask a relative for help; a nearby neighbor can help you more than relatives who are far away. 
20Pr 27:11 Be wise, my child, and I will be happy; I will have an answer for anyone who criticizes me. 
20Pr 27:12 Sensible people will see trouble coming and avoid it, but an unthinking person will walk right into it and regret it later. 
20Pr 27:13 Any people stupid enough to promise to be responsible for a stranger's debts deserve to have their own property held to guarantee payment. 
20Pr 27:14 You might as well curse your friends as wake them up early in the morning with a loud greeting. 
20Pr 27:15 A nagging wife is like water going drip-drip-drip on a rainy day. 
20Pr 27:16 How can you keep her quiet? Have you ever tried to stop the wind or ever tried to hold a handful of oil? 
20Pr 27:17 People learn from one another, just as iron sharpens iron. 
20Pr 27:18 Take care of a fig tree and you will have figs to eat. Servants who take care of their master will be honored. 
20Pr 27:19 It is your own face that you see reflected in the water and it is your own self that you see in your heart. 
20Pr 27:20 Human desires are like the world of the dead - there is always room for more. 
20Pr 27:21 Fire tests gold and silver; a person's reputation can also be tested. 
20Pr 27:22 Even if you beat fools half to death, you still can't beat their foolishness out of them. 
20Pr 27:23 Look after your sheep and cattle as carefully as you can, 
20Pr 27:24 because wealth is not permanent. Not even nations last forever. 
20Pr 27:25 You cut the hay and then cut the grass on the hillsides while the next crop of hay is growing. 
20Pr 27:26 You can make clothes from the wool of your sheep and buy land with the money you get from selling some of your goats. 
20Pr 27:27 The rest of the goats will provide milk for you and your family, and for your servant women as well. 
20Pr 28:1 The wicked run when no one is chasing them, but an honest person is as brave as a lion. 
20Pr 28:2 When a nation sins, it will have one ruler after another. But a nation will be strong and endure when it has intelligent, sensible leaders. 
20Pr 28:3 Someone in authority who oppresses poor people is like a driving rain that destroys the crops. 
20Pr 28:4 If you have no regard for the law, you are on the side of the wicked; but if you obey it, you are against them. 
20Pr 28:5 Evil people do not know what justice is, but those who worship the LORD understand it well. 
20Pr 28:6 Better to be poor and honest than rich and dishonest. 
20Pr 28:7 Young people who obey the law are intelligent. Those who make friends with good-for-nothings are a disgrace to their parents. 
20Pr 28:8 If you get rich by charging interest and taking advantage of people, your wealth will go to someone who is kind to the poor. 
20Pr 28:9 If you do not obey the law, God will find your prayers too hateful to hear. 
20Pr 28:10 If you trick an honest person into doing evil, you will fall into your own trap. The innocent will be well rewarded. 
20Pr 28:11 Rich people always think they are wise, but a poor person who has insight into character knows better. 
20Pr 28:12 When good people come to power, everybody celebrates, but when bad people rule, people stay in hiding. 
20Pr 28:13 You will never succeed in life if you try to hide your sins. Confess them and give them up; then God will show mercy to you. 
20Pr 28:14 Always obey the LORD and you will be happy. If you are stubborn, you will be ruined. 
20Pr 28:15 Poor people are helpless against a wicked ruler; he is as dangerous as a growling lion or a prowling bear. 
20Pr 28:16 A ruler without good sense will be a cruel tyrant. One who hates dishonesty will rule a long time. 
20Pr 28:17 Someone guilty of murder is digging his own grave as fast as he can. Don't try to stop him. 
20Pr 28:18 Be honest and you will be safe. If you are dishonest, you will suddenly fall. 
20Pr 28:19 A hard-working farmer has plenty to eat. People who waste time will always be poor. 
20Pr 28:20 Honest people will lead a full, happy life. But if you are in a hurry to get rich, you are going to be punished. 
20Pr 28:21 Prejudice is wrong. But some judges will do wrong to get even the smallest bribe. 
20Pr 28:22 Selfish people are in such a hurry to get rich that they do not know when poverty is about to strike. 
20Pr 28:23 Correct someone, and afterward he will appreciate it more than flattery. 
20Pr 28:24 Anyone who thinks it isn't wrong to steal from his parents is no better than a common thief. 
20Pr 28:25 Selfishness only causes trouble. You are much better off to trust the LORD. 
20Pr 28:26 It is foolish to follow your own opinions. Be safe, and follow the teachings of wiser people. 
20Pr 28:27 Give to the poor and you will never be in need. If you close your eyes to the poor, many people will curse you. 
20Pr 28:28 People stay in hiding when the wicked come to power. But when they fall from power, the righteous will rule again. 
20Pr 29:1 If you get more stubborn every time you are corrected, one day you will be crushed and never recover. 
20Pr 29:2 Show me a righteous ruler and I will show you a happy people. Show me a wicked ruler and I will show you a miserable people. 
20Pr 29:3 If you appreciate wisdom, your parents will be proud of you. It is a foolish waste to spend money on prostitutes. 
20Pr 29:4 When the king is concerned with justice, the nation will be strong, but when he is only concerned with money, he will ruin his country. 
20Pr 29:5 If you flatter your friends, you set a trap for yourself. 
20Pr 29:6 Evil people are trapped in their own sins, while honest people are happy and free. 
20Pr 29:7 A good person knows the rights of the poor, but wicked people cannot understand such things. 
20Pr 29:8 People with no regard for others can throw whole cities into turmoil. Those who are wise keep things calm. 
20Pr 29:9 When an intelligent person brings a lawsuit against a fool, the fool only laughs and becomes loud and abusive. 
20Pr 29:10 Bloodthirsty people hate anyone who's honest, but righteous people will protect the life of such a person. 
20Pr 29:11 Stupid people express their anger openly, but sensible people are patient and hold it back. 
20Pr 29:12 If a ruler pays attention to false information, all his officials will be liars. 
20Pr 29:13 A poor person and his oppressor have this in common - the LORD gave eyes to both of them. 
20Pr 29:14 If a king defends the rights of the poor, he will rule for a long time. 
20Pr 29:15 Correction and discipline are good for children. If they have their own way, they will make their mothers ashamed of them. 
20Pr 29:16 When evil people are in power, crime increases. But the righteous will live to see the downfall of such people. 
20Pr 29:17 Discipline your children and you can always be proud of them. They will never give you reason to be ashamed. 
20Pr 29:18 A nation without God's guidance is a nation without order. Happy are those who keep God's law! 
20Pr 29:19 You cannot correct servants just by talking to them. They may understand you, but they will pay no attention. 
20Pr 29:20 There is more hope for a stupid fool than for someone who speaks without thinking. 
20Pr 29:21 If you give your servants everything they want from childhood on, some day they will take over everything you own. 
20Pr 29:22 People with quick tempers cause a lot of quarreling and trouble. 
20Pr 29:23 Arrogance will bring your downfall, but if you are humble, you will be respected. 
20Pr 29:24 A thief 's partner is his own worst enemy. He will be punished if he tells the truth in court, and God will curse him if he doesn't. 
20Pr 29:25 It is dangerous to be concerned with what others think of you, but if you trust the LORD, you are safe. 
20Pr 29:26 Everybody wants the good will of the ruler, but only from the LORD can you get justice. 
20Pr 29:27 The righteous hate the wicked, and the wicked hate the righteous. 
20Pr 30:1 These are the solemn words of Agur son of Jakeh�� "God is not with me, God is not with me, and I am helpless. 
20Pr 30:2 I am more like an animal than a human being; I do not have the sense we humans should have. 
20Pr 30:3 I have never learned any wisdom, and I know nothing at all about God. 
20Pr 30:4 Have any ever mastered heavenly knowledge? Have any ever caught the wind in their hands? Or wrapped up water in a piece of cloth? Or fixed the boundaries of the earth? Who are they, if you know? Who are their children? 
20Pr 30:5 "God keeps every promise he makes. He is like a shield for all who seek his protection. 
20Pr 30:6 If you claim that he said something that he never said, he will reprimand you and show that you are a liar." 
20Pr 30:7 I ask you, God, to let me have two things before I die�� 
20Pr 30:8 keep me from lying, and let me be neither rich nor poor. So give me only as much food as I need. 
20Pr 30:9 If I have more, I might say that I do not need you. But if I am poor, I might steal and bring disgrace on my God. 
20Pr 30:10 Never criticize servants to their master. You will be cursed and suffer for it. 
20Pr 30:11 There are people who curse their fathers and do not show their appreciation for their mothers. 
20Pr 30:12 There are people who think they are pure when they are as filthy as they can be. 
20Pr 30:13 There are people who think they are so good - oh, how good they think they are! 
20Pr 30:14 There are people who take cruel advantage of the poor and needy; that is the way they make their living. 
20Pr 30:15 A leech has two daughters, and both are named "Give me!" There are four things that are never satisfied�� 
20Pr 30:16 the world of the dead, a woman without children, dry ground that needs rain, and a fire burning out of control. 
20Pr 30:17 If you make fun of your father or despise your mother in her old age, you ought to be eaten by vultures or have your eyes picked out by wild ravens. 
20Pr 30:18 There are four things that are too mysterious for me to understand�� 
20Pr 30:19 an eagle flying in the sky, a snake moving on a rock, a ship finding its way over the sea, and a man and a woman falling in love. 
20Pr 30:20 This is how an unfaithful wife acts�� she commits adultery, takes a bath, and says, "But I haven't done anything wrong!" 
20Pr 30:21 There are four things that the earth itself cannot tolerate�� 
20Pr 30:22 a slave who becomes a king, a fool who has all he wants to eat, 
20Pr 30:23 a hateful woman who gets married, and a servant woman who takes the place of her mistress. 
20Pr 30:24 There are four animals in the world that are small, but very, very clever�� 
20Pr 30:25 Ants�� they are weak, but they store up their food in the summer. 
20Pr 30:26 Rock badgers�� they are not strong either, but they make their homes among the rocks. 
20Pr 30:27 Locusts�� they have no king, but they move in formation. 
20Pr 30:28 Lizards�� you can hold one in your hand, but you can find them in palaces. 
20Pr 30:29 There are four things that are impressive to watch as they walk�� 
20Pr 30:30 lions, strongest of all animals and afraid of none; 
20Pr 30:31 goats, strutting roosters, and kings in front of their people. 
20Pr 30:32 If you have been foolish enough to be arrogant and plan evil, stop and think! 
20Pr 30:33 If you churn milk, you get butter. If you hit someone's nose, it bleeds. If you stir up anger, you get into trouble. 
20Pr 31:1 These are the solemn words which King Lemuel's mother said to him�� 
20Pr 31:2 "You are my own dear son, the answer to my prayers. What shall I tell you? 
20Pr 31:3 Don't spend all your energy on sex and all your money on women; they have destroyed kings. 
20Pr 31:4 Listen, Lemuel. Kings should not drink wine or have a craving for alcohol. 
20Pr 31:5 When they drink, they forget the laws and ignore the rights of people in need. 
20Pr 31:6 Alcohol is for people who are dying, for those who are in misery. 
20Pr 31:7 Let them drink and forget their poverty and unhappiness. 
20Pr 31:8 "Speak up for people who cannot speak for themselves. Protect the rights of all who are helpless. 
20Pr 31:9 Speak for them and be a righteous judge. Protect the rights of the poor and needy." 
20Pr 31:10 How hard it is to find a capable wife! She is worth far more than jewels! 
20Pr 31:11 Her husband puts his confidence in her, and he will never be poor. 
20Pr 31:12 As long as she lives, she does him good and never harm. 
20Pr 31:13 She keeps herself busy making wool and linen cloth. 
20Pr 31:14 She brings home food from out-of-the-way places, as merchant ships do. 
20Pr 31:15 She gets up before daylight to prepare food for her family and to tell her servant women what to do. 
20Pr 31:16 She looks at land and buys it, and with money she has earned she plants a vineyard.

21Ec 1:1 These are the words of the Philosopher, David's son, who was king in Jerusalem. 
21Ec 1:2 It is useless, useless, said the Philosopher. Life is useless, all useless. 
21Ec 1:3 You spend your life working, laboring, and what do you have to show for it? 
21Ec 1:4 Generations come and generations go, but the world stays just the same. 
21Ec 1:5 The sun still rises, and it still goes down, going wearily back to where it must start all over again. 
21Ec 1:6 The wind blows south, the wind blows north - round and round and back again. 
21Ec 1:7 Every river flows into the sea, but the sea is not yet full. The water returns to where the rivers began, and starts all over again. 
21Ec 1:8 Everything leads to weariness - a weariness too great for words. Our eyes can never see enough to be satisfied; our ears can never hear enough. 
21Ec 1:9 What has happened before will happen again. What has been done before will be done again. There is nothing new in the whole world. 
21Ec 1:10 "Look," they say, "here is something new!" But no, it has all happened before, long before we were born. 
21Ec 1:11 No one remembers what has happened in the past, and no one in days to come will remember what happens between now and then. 
21Ec 1:12 I, the Philosopher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem. 
21Ec 1:13 I determined that I would examine and study all the things that are done in this world. God has laid a miserable fate upon us. 
21Ec 1:14 I have seen everything done in this world, and I tell you, it is all useless. It is like chasing the wind. 
21Ec 1:15 You can't straighten out what is crooked; you can't count things that aren't there. 
21Ec 1:16 I told myself, "I have become a great man, far wiser than anyone who ruled Jerusalem before me. I know what wisdom and knowledge really are." 
21Ec 1:17 I was determined to learn the difference between knowledge and foolishness, wisdom and madness. But I found out that I might as well be chasing the wind. 
21Ec 1:18 The wiser you are, the more worries you have; the more you know, the more it hurts. 
21Ec 2:1 I decided to enjoy myself and find out what happiness is. But I found that this is useless, too. 
21Ec 2:2 I discovered that laughter is foolish, that pleasure does you no good. 
21Ec 2:3 Driven on by my desire for wisdom, I decided to cheer myself up with wine and have a good time. I thought that this might be the best way people can spend their short lives on earth. 
21Ec 2:4 I accomplished great things. I built myself houses and planted vineyards. 
21Ec 2:5 I planted gardens and orchards, with all kinds of fruit trees in them; 
21Ec 2:6 I dug ponds to irrigate them. 
21Ec 2:7 I bought many slaves, and there were slaves born in my household. I owned more livestock than anyone else who had ever lived in Jerusalem. 
21Ec 2:8 I also piled up silver and gold from the royal treasuries of the lands I ruled. Men and women sang to entertain me, and I had all the women a man could want. 
21Ec 2:9 Yes, I was great, greater than anyone else who had ever lived in Jerusalem, and my wisdom never failed me. 
21Ec 2:10 Anything I wanted, I got. I did not deny myself any pleasure. I was proud of everything I had worked for, and all this was my reward. 
21Ec 2:11 Then I thought about all that I had done and how hard I had worked doing it, and I realized that it didn't mean a thing. It was like chasing the wind - of no use at all. 
21Ec 2:12 After all, a king can only do what previous kings have done. So I started thinking about what it meant to be wise or reckless or foolish. 
21Ec 2:13 Oh, I know, "Wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness. 
21Ec 2:14 The wise can see where they are going, and fools cannot." But I also know that the same fate is waiting for us all. 
21Ec 2:15 I thought to myself, "What happens to fools is going to happen to me, too. So what have I gained from being so wise?" "Nothing," I answered, "not a thing." 
21Ec 2:16 No one remembers the wise, and no one remembers fools. In days to come, we will all be forgotten. We must all die - wise and foolish alike. 
21Ec 2:17 So life came to mean nothing to me, because everything in it had brought me nothing but trouble. It had all been useless; I had been chasing the wind. 
21Ec 2:18 Nothing that I had worked for and earned meant a thing to me, because I knew that I would have to leave it to my successor, 
21Ec 2:19 and he might be wise, or he might be foolish - who knows? Yet he will own everything I have worked for, everything my wisdom has earned for me in this world. It is all useless. 
21Ec 2:20 So I came to regret that I had worked so hard. 
21Ec 2:21 You work for something with all your wisdom, knowledge, and skill, and then you have to leave it all to someone who hasn't had to work for it. It is useless, and it isn't right! 
21Ec 2:22 You work and worry your way through life, and what do you have to show for it? 
21Ec 2:23 As long as you live, everything you do brings nothing but worry and heartache. Even at night your mind can't rest. It is all useless. 
21Ec 2:24 The best thing we can do is eat and drink and enjoy what we have earned. And yet, I realized that even this comes from God. 
21Ec 2:25 How else could you have anything to eat or enjoy yourself at all? 
21Ec 2:26 God gives wisdom, knowledge, and happiness to those who please him, but he makes sinners work, earning and saving, so that what they get can be given to those who please him. It is all useless. It is like chasing the wind. 
21Ec 3:1 Everything that happens in this world happens at the time God chooses. 
21Ec 3:2 He sets the time for birth and the time for death, the time for planting and the time for pulling up, 
21Ec 3:3 the time for killing and the time for healing, the time for tearing down and the time for building. 
21Ec 3:4 He sets the time for sorrow and the time for joy, the time for mourning and the time for dancing, 
21Ec 3:5 the time for making love and the time for not making love, the time for kissing and the time for not kissing. 
21Ec 3:6 He sets the time for finding and the time for losing, the time for saving and the time for throwing away, 
21Ec 3:7 the time for tearing and the time for mending, the time for silence and the time for talk. 
21Ec 3:8 He sets the time for love and the time for hate, the time for war and the time for peace. 
21Ec 3:9 What do we gain from all our work? 
21Ec 3:10 I know the heavy burdens that God has laid on us. 
21Ec 3:11 He has set the right time for everything. He has given us a desire to know the future, but never gives us the satisfaction of fully understanding what he does. 
21Ec 3:12 So I realized that all we can do is be happy and do the best we can while we are still alive. 
21Ec 3:13 All of us should eat and drink and enjoy what we have worked for. It is God's gift. 
21Ec 3:14 I know that everything God does will last forever. You can't add anything to it or take anything away from it. And one thing God does is to make us stand in awe of him. 
21Ec 3:15 Whatever happens or can happen has already happened before. God makes the same thing happen again and again. 
21Ec 3:16 In addition, I have also noticed that in this world you find wickedness where justice and right ought to be. 
21Ec 3:17 I told myself, "God is going to judge the righteous and the evil alike, because every thing, every action, will happen at its own set time." 
21Ec 3:18 I decided that God is testing us, to show us that we are no better than animals. 
21Ec 3:19 After all, the same fate awaits human beings and animals alike. One dies just like the other. They are the same kind of creature. A human being is no better off than an animal, because life has no meaning for either. 
21Ec 3:20 They are both going to the same place - the dust. They both came from it; they will both go back to it. 
21Ec 3:21 How can anyone be sure that the human spirit goes upward while an animal's spirit goes down into the ground? 
21Ec 3:22 So I realized then that the best thing we can do is enjoy what we have worked for. There is nothing else we can do. There is no way for us to know what will happen after we die. 
21Ec 4:1 Then I looked again at all the injustice that goes on in this world. The oppressed were crying, and no one would help them. No one would help them, because their oppressors had power on their side. 
21Ec 4:2 I envy those who are dead and gone; they are better off than those who are still alive. 
21Ec 4:3 But better off than either are those who have never been born, who have never seen the injustice that goes on in this world. 
21Ec 4:4 I have also learned why people work so hard to succeed�� it is because they envy the things their neighbors have. But it is useless. It is like chasing the wind. 
21Ec 4:5 They say that we would be fools to fold our hands and let ourselves starve to death. 
21Ec 4:6 Maybe so, but it is better to have only a little, with peace of mind, than be busy all the time with both hands, trying to catch the wind. 
21Ec 4:7 I have noticed something else in life that is useless. 
21Ec 4:8 Here is someone who lives alone. He has no son, no brother, yet he is always working, never satisfied with the wealth he has. For whom is he working so hard and denying himself any pleasure? This is useless, too - and a miserable way to live. 
21Ec 4:9 Two are better off than one, because together they can work more effectively. 
21Ec 4:10 If one of them falls down, the other can help him up. But if someone is alone and falls, it's just too bad, because there is no one to help him. 
21Ec 4:11 If it is cold, two can sleep together and stay warm, but how can you keep warm by yourself ? 
21Ec 4:12 Two people can resist an attack that would defeat one person alone. A rope made of three cords is hard to break. 
21Ec 4:13 Someone may rise from poverty to become king of his country, or go from prison to the throne, 
21Ec 4:14 but if in his old age he is too foolish to take advice, he is not as well off as a young man who is poor but intelligent. 
21Ec 4:15 I thought about all the people who live in this world, and I realized that somewhere among them there is a young man who will take the king's place. 
21Ec 4:16 There may be no limit to the number of people a king rules; when he is gone, no one will be grateful for what he has done. It is useless. It is like chasing the wind. 
21Ec 5:1 Be careful about going to the Temple. It is better to go there to learn than to offer sacrifices like foolish people who don't know right from wrong. 
21Ec 5:2 Think before you speak, and don't make any rash promises to God. He is in heaven and you are on earth, so don't say any more than you have to. 
21Ec 5:3 The more you worry, the more likely you are to have bad dreams, and the more you talk, the more likely you are to say something foolish. 
21Ec 5:4 So when you make a promise to God, keep it as quickly as possible. He has no use for a fool. Do what you promise to do. 
21Ec 5:5 Better not to promise at all than to make a promise and not keep it. 
21Ec 5:6 Don't let your own words lead you into sin, so that you have to tell God's priest that you didn't mean it. Why make God angry with you? Why let him destroy what you have worked for? 
21Ec 5:7 No matter how much you dream, how much useless work you do, or how much you talk, you must still stand in awe of God. 
21Ec 5:8 Don't be surprised when you see that the government oppresses the poor and denies them justice and their rights. Every official is protected by someone higher, and both are protected by still higher officials. 
21Ec 5:9 Even a king depends on the harvest. 
21Ec 5:10 If you love money, you will never be satisfied; if you long to be rich, you will never get all you want. It is useless. 
21Ec 5:11 The richer you are, the more mouths you have to feed. All you gain is the knowledge that you are rich. 
21Ec 5:12 Workers may or may not have enough to eat, but at least they can get a good night's sleep. The rich, however, have so much that they stay awake worrying. 
21Ec 5:13 Here is a terrible thing that I have seen in this world�� people save up their money for a time when they may need it, 
21Ec 5:14 and then lose it all in some bad deal and end up with nothing left to pass on to their children. 
21Ec 5:15 We leave this world just as we entered it - with nothing. In spite of all our work there is nothing we can take with us. 
21Ec 5:16 It isn't right! We go just as we came. We labor, trying to catch the wind, and what do we get? 
21Ec 5:17 We get to live our lives in darkness and grief, worried, angry, and sick. 
21Ec 5:18 Here is what I have found out�� the best thing we can do is eat and drink and enjoy what we have worked for during the short life that God has given us; this is our fate. 
21Ec 5:19 If God gives us wealth and property and lets us enjoy them, we should be grateful and enjoy what we have worked for. It is a gift from God. 
21Ec 5:20 Since God has allowed us to be happy, we will not worry too much about how short life is. 
21Ec 6:1 I have noticed that in this world a serious injustice is done. 
21Ec 6:2 God will give us wealth, honor, and property, yes, everything we want, but then will not let us enjoy it. Some stranger will enjoy it instead. It is useless, and it just isn't right. 
21Ec 6:3 We may have a hundred children and live a long time, but no matter how long we live, if we do not get our share of happiness and do not receive a decent burial, then I say that a baby born dead is better off. 
21Ec 6:4 It does that baby no good to be born; it disappears into darkness, where it is forgotten. 
21Ec 6:5 It never sees the light of day or knows what life is like, but at least it has found rest - 
21Ec 6:6 more so than the man who never enjoys life, though he may live two thousand years. After all, both of them are going to the same place. 
21Ec 6:7 We do all our work just to get something to eat, but we never have enough. 
21Ec 6:8 How are the wise better off than fools? What good does it do the poor to know how to face life? 
21Ec 6:9 It is useless; it is like chasing the wind. It is better to be satisfied with what you have than to be always wanting something else. 
21Ec 6:10 Everything that happens was already determined long ago, and we all know that you cannot argue with someone who is stronger than you. 
21Ec 6:11 The longer you argue, the more useless it is, and you are no better off. 
21Ec 6:12 How can anyone know what is best for us in this short, useless life of ours - a life that passes like a shadow? How can we know what will happen in the world after we die? 
21Ec 7:1 A good reputation is better than expensive perfume; and the day you die is better than the day you are born. 
21Ec 7:2 It is better to go to a home where there is mourning than to one where there is a party, because the living should always remind themselves that death is waiting for us all. 
21Ec 7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter; it may sadden your face, but it sharpens your understanding. 
21Ec 7:4 Someone who is always thinking about happiness is a fool. A wise person thinks about death. 
21Ec 7:5 It is better to have wise people reprimand you than to have stupid people sing your praises. 
21Ec 7:6 When a fool laughs, it is like thorns crackling in a fire. It doesn't mean a thing. 
21Ec 7:7 You may be wise, but if you cheat someone, you are acting like a fool. If you take a bribe, you ruin your character. 
21Ec 7:8 The end of something is better than its beginning. Patience is better than pride. 
21Ec 7:9 Keep your temper under control; it is foolish to harbor a grudge. 
21Ec 7:10 Never ask, "Oh, why were things so much better in the old days?" It's not an intelligent question. 
21Ec 7:11 Everyone who lives ought to be wise; it is as good as receiving an inheritance 
21Ec 7:12 and will give you as much security as money can. Wisdom keeps you safe - this is the advantage of knowledge. 
21Ec 7:13 Think about what God has done. How can anyone straighten out what God has made crooked? 
21Ec 7:14 When things are going well for you, be glad, and when trouble comes, just remember�� God sends both happiness and trouble; you never know what is going to happen next. 
21Ec 7:15 My life has been useless, but in it I have seen everything. Some good people may die while others live on, even though they are evil. 
21Ec 7:16 So don't be too good or too wise - why kill yourself ? 
21Ec 7:17 But don't be too wicked or too foolish, either - why die before you have to? 
21Ec 7:18 Avoid both extremes. If you have reverence for God, you will be successful anyway. 
21Ec 7:19 Wisdom does more for a person than ten rulers can do for a city. 
21Ec 7:20 There is no one on earth who does what is right all the time and never makes a mistake. 
21Ec 7:21 Don't pay attention to everything people say - you may hear your servant insulting you, 
21Ec 7:22 and you know yourself that you have insulted other people many times. 
21Ec 7:23 I used my wisdom to test all of this. I was determined to be wise, but it was beyond me. 
21Ec 7:24 How can anyone discover what life means? It is too deep for us, too hard to understand. 
21Ec 7:25 But I devoted myself to knowledge and study; I was determined to find wisdom and the answers to my questions, and to learn how wicked and foolish stupidity is. 
21Ec 7:26 I found something more bitter than death - the woman who is like a trap. The love she offers you will catch you like a net, and her arms around you will hold you like a chain. A man who pleases God can get away, but she will catch the sinner. 
21Ec 7:27 Yes, said the Philosopher, I found this out little by little while I was looking for answers. 
21Ec 7:28 I have looked for other answers but have found none. I found one man in a thousand that I could respect, but not one woman. 
21Ec 7:29 This is all that I have learned�� God made us plain and simple, but we have made ourselves very complicated. 
21Ec 8:1 Only the wise know what things really mean. Wisdom makes them smile and makes their frowns disappear. 
21Ec 8:2 Do what the king says, and don't make any rash promises to God. 
21Ec 8:3 The king can do anything he likes, so depart from his presence; don't stay in such a dangerous place. 
21Ec 8:4 The king acts with authority, and no one can challenge what he does. 
21Ec 8:5 As long as you obey his commands, you are safe, and a wise person knows how and when to do it. 
21Ec 8:6 There is a right time and a right way to do everything, but we know so little! 
21Ec 8:7 None of us knows what is going to happen, and there is no one to tell us. 
21Ec 8:8 No one can keep from dying or put off the day of death. That is a battle we cannot escape; we cannot cheat our way out. 
21Ec 8:9 I saw all this when I thought about the things that are done in this world, a world where some people have power and others have to suffer under them. 
21Ec 8:10 Yes, I have seen the wicked buried and in their graves, but on the way back from the cemetery people praise them in the very city where they did their evil. It is useless. 
21Ec 8:11 Why do people commit crimes so readily? Because crime is not punished quickly enough. 
21Ec 8:12 A sinner may commit a hundred crimes and still live. Oh yes, I know what they say�� "If you obey God, everything will be all right, 
21Ec 8:13 but it will not go well for the wicked. Their life is like a shadow and they will die young, because they do not obey God." 
21Ec 8:14 But this is nonsense. Look at what happens in the world�� sometimes the righteous get the punishment of the wicked, and the wicked get the reward of the righteous. I say it is useless. 
21Ec 8:15 So I am convinced that we should enjoy ourselves, because the only pleasure we have in this life is eating and drinking and enjoying ourselves. We can at least do this as we labor during the life that God has given us in this world. 
21Ec 8:16 Whenever I tried to become wise and learn what goes on in the world, I realized that you could stay awake night and day 
21Ec 8:17 and never be able to understand what God is doing. However hard you try, you will never find out. The wise may claim to know, but they don't. 
21Ec 9:1 I thought long and hard about all this and saw that God controls the actions of wise and righteous people, even their love and their hate. No one knows anything about what lies ahead. 
21Ec 9:2 It makes no difference. The same fate comes to the righteous and the wicked, to the good and the bad, to those who are religious and those who are not, to those who offer sacrifices and those who do not. A good person is no better off than a sinner; one who takes an oath is no better off than one who does not. 
21Ec 9:3 One fate comes to all alike, and this is as wrong as anything that happens in this world. As long as people live, their minds are full of evil and madness, and suddenly they die. 
21Ec 9:4 But anyone who is alive in the world of the living has some hope; a live dog is better off than a dead lion. 
21Ec 9:5 Yes, the living know they are going to die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward; they are completely forgotten. 
21Ec 9:6 Their loves, their hates, their passions, all died with them. They will never again take part in anything that happens in this world. 
21Ec 9:7 Go ahead - eat your food and be happy; drink your wine and be cheerful. It's all right with God. 
21Ec 9:8 Always look happy and cheerful. 
21Ec 9:9 Enjoy life with the one you love, as long as you live the useless life that God has given you in this world. Enjoy every useless day of it, because that is all you will get for all your trouble. 
21Ec 9:10 Work hard at whatever you do, because there will be no action, no thought, no knowledge, no wisdom in the world of the dead - and that is where you are going. 
21Ec 9:11 I realized another thing, that in this world fast runners do not always win the races, and the brave do not always win the battles. The wise do not always earn a living, intelligent people do not always get rich, and capable people do not always rise to high positions. Bad luck happens to everyone. 
21Ec 9:12 You never know when your time is coming. Like birds suddenly caught in a trap, like fish caught in a net, we are trapped at some evil moment when we least expect it. 
21Ec 9:13 There is something else I saw, a good example of how wisdom is regarded in this world. 
21Ec 9:14 There was a little town without many people in it. A powerful king attacked it. He surrounded it and prepared to break through the walls. 
21Ec 9:15 Someone lived there who was poor, but so clever that he could have saved the town. But no one thought about him. 
21Ec 9:16 I have always said that wisdom is better than strength, but no one thinks of the poor as wise or pays any attention to what they say. 
21Ec 9:17 It is better to listen to the quiet words of someone wise than to the shouts of a ruler at a council of fools. 
21Ec 9:18 Wisdom does more good than weapons, but one sinner can undo a lot of good. 
21Ec 10:1 Dead flies can make a whole bottle of perfume stink, and a little stupidity can cancel out the greatest wisdom. 
21Ec 10:2 It is natural for the wise to do the right thing and for fools to do the wrong thing. 
21Ec 10:3 Their stupidity will be evident even to strangers they meet along the way; they let everyone know that they are fools. 
21Ec 10:4 If your ruler becomes angry with you, do not hand in your resignation; serious wrongs may be pardoned if you keep calm. 
21Ec 10:5 Here is an injustice I have seen in the world - an injustice caused by rulers. 
21Ec 10:6 Stupid people are given positions of authority while the rich are ignored. 
21Ec 10:7 I have seen slaves on horseback while noblemen go on foot like slaves. 
21Ec 10:8 If you dig a pit, you fall in it; if you break through a wall, a snake bites you. 
21Ec 10:9 If you work in a stone quarry, you get hurt by stones. If you split wood, you get hurt doing it. 
21Ec 10:10 If your ax is dull and you don't sharpen it, you have to work harder to use it. It is smarter to plan ahead. 
21Ec 10:11 Knowing how to charm a snake is of no use if you let the snake bite first. 
21Ec 10:12 What the wise say brings them honor, but fools are destroyed by their own words. 
21Ec 10:13 They start out with silly talk and end up with pure madness. 
21Ec 10:14 A fool talks on and on. No one knows what is going to happen next, and no one can tell us what will happen after we die. 
21Ec 10:15 Only someone too stupid to find his way home would wear himself out with work. 
21Ec 10:16 A country is in trouble when its king is a youth and its leaders feast all night long. 
21Ec 10:17 But a country is fortunate to have a king who makes his own decisions and leaders who eat at the proper time, who control themselves and don't get drunk. 
21Ec 10:18 When you are too lazy to repair your roof, it will leak, and the house will fall in. 
21Ec 10:19 Feasting makes you happy and wine cheers you up, but you can't have either without money. 
21Ec 10:20 Don't criticize the king, even silently, and don't criticize the rich, even in the privacy of your bedroom. A bird might carry the message and tell them what you said. 
21Ec 11:1 Invest your money in foreign trade, and one of these days you will make a profit. 
21Ec 11:2 Put your investments in several places - many places even - because you never know what kind of bad luck you are going to have in this world. 
21Ec 11:3 No matter which direction a tree falls, it will lie where it fell. When the clouds are full, it rains. 
21Ec 11:4 If you wait until the wind and the weather are just right, you will never plant anything and never harvest anything. 
21Ec 11:5 God made everything, and you can no more understand what he does than you understand how new life begins in the womb of a pregnant woman. 
21Ec 11:6 Do your planting in the morning and in the evening, too. You never know whether it will all grow well or whether one planting will do better than the other. 
21Ec 11:7 It is good to be able to enjoy the pleasant light of day. 
21Ec 11:8 Be grateful for every year you live. No matter how long you live, remember that you will be dead much longer. There is nothing at all to look forward to. 
21Ec 11:9 Young people, enjoy your youth. Be happy while you are still young. Do what you want to do, and follow your heart's desire. But remember that God is going to judge you for whatever you do. 
21Ec 11:10 Don't let anything worry you or cause you pain. You aren't going to be young very long. 
21Ec 12:1 So remember your Creator while you are still young, before those dismal days and years come when you will say, "I don't enjoy life." 
21Ec 12:2 That is when the light of the sun, the moon, and the stars will grow dim for you, and the rain clouds will never pass away. 
21Ec 12:3 Then your arms, that have protected you, will tremble, and your legs, now strong, will grow weak. Your teeth will be too few to chew your food, and your eyes too dim to see clearly. 
21Ec 12:4 Your ears will be deaf to the noise of the street. You will barely be able to hear the mill as it grinds or music as it plays, but even the song of a bird will wake you from sleep. 
21Ec 12:5 You will be afraid of high places, and walking will be dangerous. Your hair will turn white; you will hardly be able to drag yourself along, and all desire will be gone. We are going to our final resting place, and then there will be mourning in the streets. 
21Ec 12:6 The silver chain will snap, and the golden lamp will fall and break; the rope at the well will break, and the water jar will be shattered. 
21Ec 12:7 Our bodies will return to the dust of the earth, and the breath of life will go back to God, who gave it to us. 
21Ec 12:8 Useless, useless, said the Philosopher. It is all useless. 
21Ec 12:9 But because the Philosopher was wise, he kept on teaching the people what he knew. He studied proverbs and honestly tested their truth. 
21Ec 12:10 The Philosopher tried to find comforting words, but the words he wrote were honest. 
21Ec 12:11 The sayings of the wise are like the sharp sticks that shepherds use to guide sheep, and collected proverbs are as lasting as firmly driven nails. They have been given by God, the one Shepherd of us all. 
21Ec 12:12 My child, there is something else to watch out for. There is no end to the writing of books, and too much study will wear you out. 
21Ec 12:13 After all this, there is only one thing to say�� Have reverence for God, and obey his commands, because this is all that we were created for. 
21Ec 12:14 God is going to judge everything we do, whether good or bad, even things done in secret.

22Sg 1:1 The most beautiful of songs, by Solomon. 
22Sg 1:2 Your lips cover me with kisses; your love is better than wine. 
22Sg 1:3 There is a fragrance about you; the sound of your name recalls it. No woman could keep from loving you. 
22Sg 1:4 Take me with you, and we'll run away; be my king and take me to your room. We will be happy together, drink deep, and lose ourselves in love. No wonder all women love you! 
22Sg 1:5 Women of Jerusalem, I am dark but beautiful, dark as the desert tents of Kedar, but beautiful as the draperies in Solomon's palace. 
22Sg 1:6 Don't look down on me because of my color, because the sun has tanned me. My brothers were angry with me and made me work in the vineyard. I had no time to care for myself. 
22Sg 1:7 Tell me, my love, Where will you lead your flock to graze? Where will they rest from the noonday sun? Why should I need to look for you among the flocks of the other shepherds? 
22Sg 1:8 Don't you know the place, loveliest of women? Go and follow the flock; find pasture for your goats near the tents of the shepherds. 
22Sg 1:9 You, my love, excite men as a mare excites the stallions of Pharaoh's chariots. 
22Sg 1:10 Your hair is beautiful upon your cheeks and falls along your neck like jewels. 
22Sg 1:11 But we will make for you a chain of gold with ornaments of silver. 
22Sg 1:12 My king was lying on his couch, and my perfume filled the air with fragrance. 
22Sg 1:13 My lover has the scent of myrrh as he lies upon my breasts. 
22Sg 1:14 My lover is like the wild flowers that bloom in the vineyards at Engedi. 
22Sg 1:15 How beautiful you are, my love; how your eyes shine with love! 
22Sg 1:16 How handsome you are, my dearest; how you delight me! The green grass will be our bed; 
22Sg 1:17 the cedars will be the beams of our house, and the cypress trees the ceiling. 
22Sg 2:1 I am only a wild flower in Sharon, a lily in a mountain valley. 
22Sg 2:2 Like a lily among thorns is my darling among women. 
22Sg 2:3 Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my dearest compared to other men. I love to sit in its shadow, and its fruit is sweet to my taste. 
22Sg 2:4 He brought me to his banquet hall and raised the banner of love over me. 
22Sg 2:5 Restore my strength with raisins and refresh me with apples! I am weak from passion. 
22Sg 2:6 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand caresses me. 
22Sg 2:7 Promise me, women of Jerusalem; swear by the swift deer and the gazelles that you will not interrupt our love. 
22Sg 2:8 I hear my lover's voice. He comes running over the mountains, racing across the hills to me. 
22Sg 2:9 My lover is like a gazelle, like a young stag. There he stands beside the wall. He looks in through the window and glances through the lattice. 
22Sg 2:10 My lover speaks to me. Come then, my love; my darling, come with me. 
22Sg 2:11 The winter is over; the rains have stopped; 
22Sg 2:12 in the countryside the flowers are in bloom. This is the time for singing; the song of doves is heard in the fields. 
22Sg 2:13 Figs are beginning to ripen; the air is fragrant with blossoming vines. Come then, my love; my darling, come with me. 
22Sg 2:14 You are like a dove that hides in the crevice of a rock. Let me see your lovely face and hear your enchanting voice. 
22Sg 2:15 Catch the foxes, the little foxes, before they ruin our vineyard in bloom. 
22Sg 2:16 My lover is mine, and I am his. He feeds his flock among the lilies 
22Sg 2:17 until the morning breezes blow and the darkness disappears. Return, my darling, like a gazelle, like a stag on the mountains of Bether. 
22Sg 3:1 Asleep on my bed, night after night I dreamed of the one I love; I was looking for him, but couldn't find him. 
22Sg 3:2 I went wandering through the city, through its streets and alleys. I looked for the one I love. I looked, but couldn't find him. 
22Sg 3:3 The sentries patrolling the city saw me. I asked them, "Have you found my lover?" 
22Sg 3:4 As soon as I left them, I found him. I held him and wouldn't let him go until I took him to my mother's house, to the room where I was born. 
22Sg 3:5 Promise me, women of Jerusalem; swear by the swift deer and the gazelles that you will not interrupt our love. 
22Sg 3:6 What is this coming from the desert like a column of smoke, fragrant with incense and myrrh, the incense sold by the traders? 
22Sg 3:7 Solomon is coming, carried on his throne; sixty soldiers form the bodyguard, the finest soldiers in Israel. 
22Sg 3:8 All of them are skillful with the sword; they are battle-hardened veterans. Each of them is armed with a sword, on guard against a night attack. 
22Sg 3:9 King Solomon is carried on a throne made of the finest wood. 
22Sg 3:10 Its posts are covered with silver; over it is cloth embroidered with gold. Its cushions are covered with purple cloth, lovingly woven by the women of Jerusalem. 
22Sg 3:11 Women of Zion, come and see King Solomon. He is wearing the crown that his mother placed on his head on his wedding day, on the day of his gladness and joy. 
22Sg 4:1 How beautiful you are, my love! How your eyes shine with love behind your veil. Your hair dances like a flock of goats bounding down the hills of Gilead. 
22Sg 4:2 Your teeth are as white as sheep that have just been shorn and washed. Not one of them is missing; they are all perfectly matched. 
22Sg 4:3 Your lips are like a scarlet ribbon; how lovely they are when you speak. Your cheeks glow behind your veil. 
22Sg 4:4 Your neck is like the tower of David, round and smooth, with a necklace like a thousand shields hung around it. 
22Sg 4:5 Your breasts are like gazelles, twin deer feeding among lilies. 
22Sg 4:6 I will stay on the hill of myrrh, the hill of incense, until the morning breezes blow and the darkness disappears. 
22Sg 4:7 How beautiful you are, my love; how perfect you are! 
22Sg 4:8 Come with me from the Lebanon Mountains, my bride; come with me from Lebanon. Come down from the top of Mount Amana, from Mount Senir and Mount Hermon, where the lions and leopards live. 
22Sg 4:9 The look in your eyes, my sweetheart and bride, and the necklace you are wearing have stolen my heart. 
22Sg 4:10 Your love delights me, my sweetheart and bride. Your love is better than wine; your perfume more fragrant than any spice. 
22Sg 4:11 The taste of honey is on your lips, my darling; your tongue is milk and honey for me. Your clothing has all the fragrance of Lebanon. 
22Sg 4:12 My sweetheart, my bride, is a secret garden, a walled garden, a private spring; 
22Sg 4:13 there the plants flourish. They grow like an orchard of pomegranate trees and bear the finest fruits. There is no lack of henna and nard, 
22Sg 4:14 of saffron, calamus, and cinnamon, or incense of every kind. Myrrh and aloes grow there with all the most fragrant perfumes. 
22Sg 4:15 Fountains water the garden, streams of flowing water, brooks gushing down from the Lebanon Mountains. 
22Sg 4:16 Wake up, North Wind. South Wind, blow on my garden; fill the air with fragrance. Let my lover come to his garden and eat the best of its fruits. 
22Sg 5:1 I have entered my garden, my sweetheart, my bride. I am gathering my spices and myrrh; I am eating my honey and honeycomb; I am drinking my wine and milk. Eat, lovers, and drink until you are drunk with love! 
22Sg 5:2 While I slept, my heart was awake. I dreamed my lover knocked at the door. Let me come in, my darling, my sweetheart, my dove. My head is wet with dew, and my hair is damp from the mist. 
22Sg 5:3 I have already undressed; why should I get dressed again? I have washed my feet; why should I get them dirty again? 
22Sg 5:4 My lover put his hand to the door, and I was thrilled that he was near. 
22Sg 5:5 I was ready to let him come in. My hands were covered with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, as I grasped the handle of the door. 
22Sg 5:6 I opened the door for my lover, but he had already gone. How I wanted to hear his voice! I looked for him, but couldn't find him; I called to him, but heard no answer. 
22Sg 5:7 The sentries patrolling the city found me; they struck me and bruised me; the guards at the city wall tore off my cape. 
22Sg 5:8 Promise me, women of Jerusalem, that if you find my lover, you will tell him I am weak from passion. 
22Sg 5:9 Most beautiful of women, is your lover different from everyone else? What is there so wonderful about him that we should give you our promise? 
22Sg 5:10 My lover is handsome and strong; he is one in ten thousand. 
22Sg 5:11 His face is bronzed and smooth; his hair is wavy, black as a raven. 
22Sg 5:12 His eyes are as beautiful as doves by a flowing brook, doves washed in milk and standing by the stream. 
22Sg 5:13 His cheeks are as lovely as a garden that is full of herbs and spices. His lips are like lilies, wet with liquid myrrh. 
22Sg 5:14 His hands are well-formed, and he wears rings set with gems. His body is like smooth ivory, with sapphires set in it. 
22Sg 5:15 His thighs are columns of alabaster set in sockets of gold. He is majestic, like the Lebanon Mountains with their towering cedars. 
22Sg 5:16 His mouth is sweet to kiss; everything about him enchants me. This is what my lover is like, women of Jerusalem. 
22Sg 6:1 Most beautiful of women, where has your lover gone? Tell us which way your lover went, so that we can help you find him. 
22Sg 6:2 My lover has gone to his garden, where the balsam trees grow. He is feeding his flock in the garden and gathering lilies. 
22Sg 6:3 My lover is mine, and I am his; he feeds his flock among the lilies. 
22Sg 6:4 My love, you are as beautiful as Jerusalem, as lovely as the city of Tirzah, as breathtaking as these great cities. 
22Sg 6:5 Turn your eyes away from me; they are holding me captive. Your hair dances like a flock of goats bounding down the hills of Gilead. 
22Sg 6:6 Your teeth are as white as a flock of sheep that have just been washed. Not one of them is missing; they are all perfectly matched. 
22Sg 6:7 Your cheeks glow behind your veil. 
22Sg 6:8 Let the king have sixty queens, eighty concubines, young women without number! 
22Sg 6:9 But I love only one, and she is as lovely as a dove. She is her mother's only daughter, her mother's favorite child. All women look at her and praise her; queens and concubines sing her praises. 
22Sg 6:10 Who is this whose glance is like the dawn? She is beautiful and bright, as dazzling as the sun or the moon. 
22Sg 6:11 I have come down among the almond trees to see the young plants in the valley, to see the new leaves on the vines and the blossoms on the pomegranate trees. 
22Sg 6:12 I am trembling; you have made me as eager for love as a chariot driver is for battle. 
22Sg 6:13 Dance, dance, girl of Shulam. Let us watch you as you dance. Why do you want to watch me as I dance between the rows of onlookers? 
22Sg 6:14 ����
22Sg 7:1 What a magnificent young woman you are! How beautiful are your feet in sandals. The curve of your thighs is like the work of an artist. 
22Sg 7:2 A bowl is there, that never runs out of spiced wine. A sheaf of wheat is there, surrounded by lilies. 
22Sg 7:3 Your breasts are like twin deer, like two gazelles. 
22Sg 7:4 Your neck is like a tower of ivory. Your eyes are like the pools in the city of Heshbon, near the gate of that great city. Your nose is as lovely as the tower of Lebanon that stands guard at Damascus. 
22Sg 7:5 Your head is held high like Mount Carmel. Your braided hair shines like the finest satin; its beauty could hold a king captive. 
22Sg 7:6 How pretty you are, how beautiful; how complete the delights of your love. 
22Sg 7:7 You are as graceful as a palm tree, and your breasts are clusters of dates. 
22Sg 7:8 I will climb the palm tree and pick its fruit. To me your breasts are like bunches of grapes, your breath like the fragrance of apples, 
22Sg 7:9 and your mouth like the finest wine. Then let the wine flow straight to my lover, flowing over his lips and teeth. 
22Sg 7:10 I belong to my lover, and he desires me. 
22Sg 7:11 Come, darling, let's go out to the countryside and spend the night in the villages. 
22Sg 7:12 We will get up early and look at the vines to see whether they've started to grow, whether the blossoms are opening and the pomegranate trees are in bloom. There I will give you my love. 
22Sg 7:13 You can smell the scent of mandrakes, and all the pleasant fruits are near our door. Darling, I have kept for you the old delights and the new. 
22Sg 8:1 I wish that you were my brother, that my mother had nursed you at her breast. Then, if I met you in the street, I could kiss you and no one would mind. 
22Sg 8:2 I would take you to my mother's house, where you could teach me love. I would give you spiced wine, my pomegranate wine to drink. 
22Sg 8:3 Your left hand is under my head, and your right hand caresses me. 
22Sg 8:4 Promise me, women of Jerusalem, that you will not interrupt our love. 
22Sg 8:5 Who is this coming from the desert, arm in arm with her lover? Under the apple tree I woke you, in the place where you were born. 
22Sg 8:6 Close your heart to every love but mine; hold no one in your arms but me. Love is as powerful as death; passion is as strong as death itself. It bursts into flame and burns like a raging fire. 
22Sg 8:7 Water cannot put it out; no flood can drown it. But if any tried to buy love with their wealth, contempt is all they would get. 
22Sg 8:8 We have a young sister, and her breasts are still small. What will we do for her when a young man comes courting? 
22Sg 8:9 If she is a wall, we will build her a silver tower. But if she is a gate, we will protect her with panels of cedar. 
22Sg 8:10 I am a wall, and my breasts are its towers. My lover knows that with him I find contentment and peace. 
22Sg 8:11 Solomon has a vineyard in a place called Baal Hamon. There are farmers who rent it from him; each one pays a thousand silver coins. 
22Sg 8:12 Solomon is welcome to his thousand coins, and the farmers to two hundred as their share; I have a vineyard of my own! 
22Sg 8:13 Let me hear your voice from the garden, my love; my companions are waiting to hear you speak. 
22Sg 8:14 Come to me, my lover, like a gazelle, like a young stag on the mountains where spices grow.

23Is 1:1 This book contains the messages about Judah and Jerusalem which God revealed to Isaiah son of Amoz during the time when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah. 
23Is 1:2 The LORD said, "Earth and sky, listen to what I am saying! The children I brought up have rebelled against me. 
23Is 1:3 Cattle know who owns them, and donkeys know where their master feeds them. But that is more than my people Israel know. They don't understand at all." 
23Is 1:4 You are doomed, you sinful nation, you corrupt and evil people! Your sins drag you down! You have rejected the LORD, the holy God of Israel, and have turned your backs on him. 
23Is 1:5 Why do you keep on rebelling? Do you want to be punished even more? Israel, your head is already covered with wounds, and your heart and mind are sick. 
23Is 1:6 From head to foot there is not a healthy spot on your body. You are covered with bruises and sores and open wounds. Your wounds have not been cleaned or bandaged. No medicine has been put on them. 
23Is 1:7 Your country has been devastated, and your cities have been burned to the ground. While you look on, foreigners take over your land and bring everything to ruin. 
23Is 1:8 Jerusalem alone is left, a city under siege - as defenseless as a guard's hut in a vineyard or a shed in a cucumber field. 
23Is 1:9 If the LORD Almighty had not let some of the people survive, Jerusalem would have been totally destroyed, just as Sodom and Gomorrah were. 
23Is 1:10 Jerusalem, your rulers and your people are like those of Sodom and Gomorrah. Listen to what the LORD is saying to you. Pay attention to what our God is teaching you. 
23Is 1:11 He says, "Do you think I want all these sacrifices you keep offering to me? I have had more than enough of the sheep you burn as sacrifices and of the fat of your fine animals. I am tired of the blood of bulls and sheep and goats. 
23Is 1:12 Who asked you to bring me all this when you come to worship me? Who asked you to do all this tramping around in my Temple? 
23Is 1:13 It's useless to bring your offerings. I am disgusted with the smell of the incense you burn. I cannot stand your New Moon Festivals, your Sabbaths, and your religious gatherings; they are all corrupted by your sins. 
23Is 1:14 I hate your New Moon Festivals and holy days; they are a burden that I am tired of bearing. 
23Is 1:15 "When you lift your hands in prayer, I will not look at you. No matter how much you pray, I will not listen, for your hands are covered with blood. 
23Is 1:16 Wash yourselves clean. Stop all this evil that I see you doing. Yes, stop doing evil 
23Is 1:17 and learn to do right. See that justice is done - help those who are oppressed, give orphans their rights, and defend widows." 
23Is 1:18 The LORD says, "Now, let's settle the matter. You are stained red with sin, but I will wash you as clean as snow. Although your stains are deep red, you will be as white as wool. 
23Is 1:19 If you will only obey me, you will eat the good things the land produces. 
23Is 1:20 But if you defy me, you are doomed to die. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
23Is 1:21 The city that once was faithful is behaving like a whore! At one time it was filled with righteous people, but now only murderers remain. 
23Is 1:22 Jerusalem, you were once like silver, but now you are worthless; you were like good wine, but now you are only water. 
23Is 1:23 Your leaders are rebels and friends of thieves; they are always accepting gifts and bribes. They never defend orphans in court or listen when widows present their case. 
23Is 1:24 So now, listen to what the LORD Almighty, Israel's powerful God, is saying�� "I will take revenge on you, my enemies, and you will cause me no more trouble. 
23Is 1:25 I will take action against you. I will purify you the way metal is refined, and will remove all your impurity. 
23Is 1:26 I will give you rulers and advisers like those you had long ago. Then Jerusalem will be called the righteous, faithful city." 
23Is 1:27 Because the LORD is righteous, he will save Jerusalem and everyone there who repents. 
23Is 1:28 But he will crush everyone who sins and rebels against him; he will kill everyone who forsakes him. 
23Is 1:29 You will be sorry that you ever worshiped trees and planted sacred gardens. 
23Is 1:30 You will wither like a dying oak, like a garden that no one waters. 
23Is 1:31 Just as straw is set on fire by a spark, so powerful people will be destroyed by their own evil deeds, and no one will be able to stop the destruction. 
23Is 2:1 Here is the message which God gave to Isaiah son of Amoz about Judah and Jerusalem�� 
23Is 2:2 In days to come the mountain where the Temple stands will be the highest one of all, towering above all the hills. Many nations will come streaming to it, 
23Is 2:3 and their people will say, "Let us go up the hill of the LORD, to the Temple of Israel's God. He will teach us what he wants us to do; we will walk in the paths he has chosen. For the LORD's teaching comes from Jerusalem; from Zion he speaks to his people." 
23Is 2:4 He will settle disputes among great nations. They will hammer their swords into plows and their spears into pruning knives. Nations will never again go to war, never prepare for battle again. 
23Is 2:5 Now, descendants of Jacob, let us walk in the light which the LORD gives us! 
23Is 2:6 O God, you have forsaken your people, the descendants of Jacob! The land is full of magic practices from the East and from Philistia. The people follow foreign customs. 
23Is 2:7 Their land is full of silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures. Their land is full of horses, and there is no end to their chariots. 
23Is 2:8 Their land is full of idols, and they worship objects that they have made with their own hands. 
23Is 2:9 Everyone will be humiliated and disgraced. Do not forgive them, LORD! 
23Is 2:10 They will hide in caves in the rocky hills or dig holes in the ground to try to escape from the LORD's anger and to hide from his power and glory! 
23Is 2:11 A day is coming when human pride will be ended and human arrogance destroyed. Then the LORD alone will be exalted. 
23Is 2:12 On that day the LORD Almighty will humble everyone who is powerful, everyone who is proud and conceited. 
23Is 2:13 He will destroy the tall cedars of Lebanon and all the oaks in the land of Bashan. 
23Is 2:14 He will level the high mountains and hills, 
23Is 2:15 every high tower, and the walls of every fortress. 
23Is 2:16 He will sink even the largest and most beautiful ships. 
23Is 2:17 Human pride will be ended, and human arrogance will be destroyed. 
23Is 2:18 Idols will completely disappear, and the LORD alone will be exalted on that day. 
23Is 2:19 People will hide in caves in the rocky hills or dig holes in the ground to try to escape from the LORD's anger and to hide from his power and glory, when he comes to shake the earth. 
23Is 2:20 When that day comes, they will throw away the gold and silver idols they have made, and abandon them to the moles and the bats. 
23Is 2:21 When the LORD comes to shake the earth, people will hide in holes and caves in the rocky hills to try to escape from his anger and to hide from his power and glory. 
23Is 2:22 Put no more confidence in mortals. What are they worth? 
23Is 3:1 Now the Lord, the Almighty LORD, is about to take away from Jerusalem and Judah everything and everyone that the people depend on. He is going to take away their food and their water, 
23Is 3:2 their heroes and their soldiers, their judges and their prophets, their fortunetellers and their statesmen, 
23Is 3:3 their military and civilian leaders, their politicians and everyone who uses magic to control events. 
23Is 3:4 The LORD will let the people be governed by immature boys. 
23Is 3:5 Everyone will take advantage of everyone else. Young people will not respect their elders, and worthless people will not respect their superiors. 
23Is 3:6 A time will come when the members of a clan will choose one of their number and say to him, "You at least have something to wear, so be our leader in this time of trouble." 
23Is 3:7 But he will answer, "Not me! I can't help you. I don't have any food or clothes either. Don't make me your leader!" 
23Is 3:8 Yes, Jerusalem is doomed! Judah is collapsing! Everything they say and do is against the LORD; they openly insult God himself. 
23Is 3:9 Their prejudices will be held against them. They sin as openly as the people of Sodom did. They are doomed, and they have brought it on themselves. 
23Is 3:10 The righteous will be happy, and things will go well for them. They will get to enjoy what they have worked for. 
23Is 3:11 But evil people are doomed; what they have done to others will now be done to them. 
23Is 3:12 Moneylenders oppress my people, and their creditors cheat them. My people, your leaders are misleading you, so that you do not know which way to turn. 
23Is 3:13 The LORD is ready to state his case; he is ready to judge his people. 
23Is 3:14 The LORD is bringing the elders and leaders of his people to judgment. He makes this accusation�� "You have plundered vineyards, and your houses are full of what you have taken from the poor. 
23Is 3:15 You have no right to crush my people and take advantage of the poor. I, the Sovereign LORD Almighty, have spoken." 
23Is 3:16 The LORD said, "Look how proud the women of Jerusalem are! They walk along with their noses in the air. They are always flirting. They take dainty little steps, and the bracelets on their ankles jingle. 
23Is 3:17 But I will punish them - I will shave their heads and leave them bald." 
23Is 3:18 A day is coming when the Lord will take away from the women of Jerusalem everything they are so proud of - the ornaments they wear on their ankles, on their heads, on their necks, 
23Is 3:19 and on their wrists. He will take away their veils 
23Is 3:20 and their hats; the magic charms they wear on their arms and at their waists; 
23Is 3:21 the rings they wear on their fingers and in their noses; 
23Is 3:22 all their fine robes, gowns, cloaks, and purses; 
23Is 3:23 their revealing garments, their linen handkerchiefs, and the scarves and long veils they wear on their heads. 
23Is 3:24 Instead of using perfumes, they will stink; instead of fine belts, they will wear coarse ropes; instead of having beautiful hair, they will be bald; instead of fine clothes, they will be dressed in rags; their beauty will be turned to shame! 
23Is 3:25 The men of the city, yes, even the strongest men, will be killed in war. 
23Is 3:26 The city gates will mourn and cry, and the city itself will be like a woman sitting on the ground, stripped naked. 
23Is 4:1 When that time comes, seven women will grab hold of one man and say, "We can feed and clothe ourselves, but please let us say you are our husband, so that we won't have to endure the shame of being unmarried." 
23Is 4:2 The time is coming when the LORD will make every plant and tree in the land grow large and beautiful. All the people of Israel who survive will take delight and pride in the crops that the land produces. 
23Is 4:3 Everyone who is left in Jerusalem, whom God has chosen for survival, will be called holy. 
23Is 4:4 By his power the Lord will judge and purify the nation and wash away the guilt of Jerusalem and the blood that has been shed there. 
23Is 4:5 Then over Mount Zion and over all who are gathered there, the LORD will send a cloud in the daytime and smoke and a bright flame at night. God's glory will cover and protect the whole city. 
23Is 4:6 His glory will shade the city from the heat of the day and make it a place of safety, sheltered from the rain and storm. 
23Is 5:1 Listen while I sing you this song, a song of my friend and his vineyard�� My friend had a vineyard on a very fertile hill. 
23Is 5:2 He dug the soil and cleared it of stones; he planted the finest vines. He built a tower to guard them, dug a pit for treading the grapes. He waited for the grapes to ripen, but every grape was sour. 
23Is 5:3 So now my friend says, "You people who live in Jerusalem and Judah, judge between my vineyard and me. 
23Is 5:4 Is there anything I failed to do for it? Then why did it produce sour grapes and not the good grapes I expected? 
23Is 5:5 "Here is what I am going to do to my vineyard�� I will take away the hedge around it, break down the wall that protects it, and let wild animals eat it and trample it down. 
23Is 5:6 I will let it be overgrown with weeds. I will not trim the vines or hoe the ground; instead, I will let briers and thorns cover it. I will even forbid the clouds to let rain fall on it." 
23Is 5:7 Israel is the vineyard of the LORD Almighty; the people of Judah are the vines he planted. He expected them to do what was good, but instead they committed murder. He expected them to do what was right, but their victims cried out for justice. 
23Is 5:8 You are doomed! You buy more houses and fields to add to those you already have. Soon there will be no place for anyone else to live, and you alone will live in the land. 
23Is 5:9 I have heard the LORD Almighty say, "All these big, fine houses will be empty ruins. 
23Is 5:10 The grapevines growing on five acres of land will yield only five gallons of wine. Ten bushels of seed will produce only one bushel of grain." 
23Is 5:11 You are doomed! You get up early in the morning to start drinking, and you spend long evenings getting drunk. 
23Is 5:12 At your feasts you have harps and tambourines and flutes - and wine. But you don't understand what the LORD is doing, 
23Is 5:13 and so you will be carried away as prisoners. Your leaders will starve to death, and the common people will die of thirst. 
23Is 5:14 The world of the dead is hungry for them, and it opens its mouth wide. It gulps down the nobles of Jerusalem along with the noisy crowd of common people. 
23Is 5:15 Everyone will be disgraced, and all who are proud will be humbled. 
23Is 5:16 But the LORD Almighty shows his greatness by doing what is right, and he reveals his holiness by judging his people. 
23Is 5:17 In the ruins of the cities lambs will eat grass and young goats will find pasture. 
23Is 5:18 You are doomed! You are unable to break free from your sins. 
23Is 5:19 You say, "Let the LORD hurry up and do what he says he will, so that we can see it. Let Israel's holy God carry out his plans; let's see what he has in mind." 
23Is 5:20 You are doomed! You call evil good and call good evil. You turn darkness into light and light into darkness. You make what is bitter sweet, and what is sweet you make bitter. 
23Is 5:21 You are doomed! You think you are wise, so very clever. 
23Is 5:22 You are doomed! Heroes of the wine bottle! Brave and fearless when it comes to mixing drinks! 
23Is 5:23 But for just a bribe you let the guilty go free, and you keep the innocent from getting justice. 
23Is 5:24 So now, just as straw and dry grass shrivel and burn in the fire, your roots will rot and your blossoms will dry up and blow away, because you have rejected what the LORD Almighty, Israel's holy God, has taught us. 
23Is 5:25 The LORD is angry with his people and has stretched out his hand to punish them. The mountains will shake, and the bodies of those who die will be left in the streets like rubbish. Yet even then the LORD's anger will not be ended, but his hand will still be stretched out to punish. 
23Is 5:26 The LORD gives a signal to call for a distant nation. He whistles for them to come from the ends of the earth. And here they come, swiftly, quickly! 
23Is 5:27 None of them grow tired; none of them stumble. They never doze or sleep. Not a belt is loose; not a sandal strap is broken. 
23Is 5:28 Their arrows are sharp, and their bows are ready to shoot. Their horses' hoofs are as hard as flint, and their chariot wheels turn like a whirlwind. 
23Is 5:29 The soldiers roar like lions that have killed an animal and are carrying it off where no one can take it away from them. 
23Is 5:30 When that day comes, they will roar over Israel as loudly as the sea. Look at this country! Darkness and distress! The light is swallowed by darkness. 
23Is 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord. He was sitting on his throne, high and exalted, and his robe filled the whole Temple. 
23Is 6:2 Around him flaming creatures were standing, each of which had six wings. Each creature covered its face with two wings, and its body with two, and used the other two for flying. 
23Is 6:3 They were calling out to each other�� "Holy, holy, holy! The LORD Almighty is holy! His glory fills the world." 
23Is 6:4 The sound of their voices made the foundation of the Temple shake, and the Temple itself became filled with smoke. 
23Is 6:5 I said, "There is no hope for me! I am doomed because every word that passes my lips is sinful, and I live among a people whose every word is sinful. And yet, with my own eyes I have seen the King, the LORD Almighty." 
23Is 6:6 Then one of the creatures flew down to me, carrying a burning coal that he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. 
23Is 6:7 He touched my lips with the burning coal and said, "This has touched your lips, and now your guilt is gone, and your sins are forgiven." 
23Is 6:8 Then I heard the Lord say, "Whom shall I send? Who will be our messenger?" I answered, "I will go! Send me!" 
23Is 6:9 So he told me to go and give the people this message�� "No matter how much you listen, you will not understand. No matter how much you look, you will not know what is happening." 
23Is 6:10 Then he said to me, "Make the minds of these people dull, their ears deaf, and their eyes blind, so that they cannot see or hear or understand. If they did, they might turn to me and be healed." 
23Is 6:11 I asked, "How long will it be like this, Lord?" He answered, "Until the cities are ruined and empty - until the houses are uninhabited - until the land itself is a desolate wasteland. 
23Is 6:12 I will send the people far away and make the whole land desolate. 
23Is 6:13 Even if one person out of ten remains in the land, he too will be destroyed; he will be like the stump of an oak tree that has been cut down." (The stump represents a new beginning for God's people.) 
23Is 7:1 When King Ahaz, the son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah, ruled Judah, war broke out. Rezin, king of Syria, and Pekah son of Remaliah, king of Israel, attacked Jerusalem, but were unable to capture it. 
23Is 7:2 When word reached the king of Judah that the armies of Syria were already in the territory of Israel, he and all his people were so terrified that they trembled like trees shaking in the wind. 
23Is 7:3 The LORD said to Isaiah, "Take your son Shear Jashub, and go to meet King Ahaz. You will find him on the road where the cloth makers work, at the end of the ditch that brings water from the upper pool. 
23Is 7:4 Tell him to keep alert, to stay calm, and not to be frightened or disturbed. The anger of King Rezin and his Syrians and of King Pekah is no more dangerous than the smoke from two smoldering sticks of wood. 
23Is 7:5 Syria, together with Israel and its king, has made a plot. 
23Is 7:6 They intend to invade Judah, terrify the people into joining their side, and then put Tabeel's son on the throne. 
23Is 7:7 "But I, the LORD, declare that this will never happen. 
23Is 7:8 Why? Because Syria is no stronger than Damascus, its capital city, and Damascus is no stronger than King Rezin. As for Israel, within sixty-five years it will be too shattered to survive as a nation. 
23Is 7:9 Israel is no stronger than Samaria, its capital city, and Samaria is no stronger than King Pekah. "If your faith is not enduring, you will not endure." 
23Is 7:10 The LORD sent another message to Ahaz�� 
23Is 7:11 "Ask the LORD your God to give you a sign. It can be from deep in the world of the dead or from high up in heaven." 
23Is 7:12 Ahaz answered, "I will not ask for a sign. I refuse to put the LORD to the test." 
23Is 7:13 To that Isaiah replied, "Listen, now, descendants of King David. It's bad enough for you to wear out the patience of people - do you have to wear out God's patience too? 
23Is 7:14 Well then, the Lord himself will give you a sign�� a young woman who is pregnant will have a son and will name him 'Immanuel.' 
23Is 7:15 By the time he is old enough to make his own decisions, people will be drinking milk and eating honey. 
23Is 7:16 Even before that time comes, the lands of those two kings who terrify you will be deserted. 
23Is 7:17 "The LORD is going to bring on you, on your people, and on the whole royal family, days of trouble worse than any that have come since the kingdom of Israel separated from Judah - he is going to bring the king of Assyria. 
23Is 7:18 "When that time comes, the LORD will whistle as a signal for the Egyptians to come like flies from the farthest branches of the Nile, and for the Assyrians to come from their land like bees. 
23Is 7:19 They will swarm in the rugged valleys and in the caves in the rocks, and they will cover every thorn bush and every pasture. 
23Is 7:20 "When that time comes, the Lord will hire a barber from across the Euphrates - the emperor of Assyria! - and he will shave off your beards and the hair on your heads and your bodies. 
23Is 7:21 "When that time comes, even if a farmer has been able to save only one young cow and two goats, 
23Is 7:22 they will give so much milk that he will have all he needs. Yes, the few survivors left in the land will have milk and honey to eat. 
23Is 7:23 "When that time comes, the fine vineyards, each with a thousand vines and each worth a thousand pieces of silver, will be overgrown with thorn bushes and briers. 
23Is 7:24 People will go hunting there with bows and arrows. Yes, the whole country will be full of briers and thorn bushes. 
23Is 7:25 All the hills where crops were once planted will be so overgrown with thorns that no one will go there. It will be a place where cattle and sheep graze." 
23Is 8:1 The LORD said to me, "Take a large piece of writing material and write on it in large letters�� 'Quick Loot, Fast Plunder.' 
23Is 8:2 Get two reliable men, the priest Uriah and Zechariah son of Jeberechiah, to serve as witnesses." 
23Is 8:3 Some time later my wife became pregnant. When our son was born, the LORD said to me, "Name him 'Quick-Loot-Fast-Plunder.' 
23Is 8:4 Before the boy is old enough to say 'Mamma' and 'Daddy,' all the wealth of Damascus and all the loot of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria." 
23Is 8:5 The LORD spoke to me again. 
23Is 8:6 He said, "Because these people have rejected the quiet waters of Shiloah Brook and tremble before King Rezin and King Pekah, 
23Is 8:7 I, the Lord, will bring the emperor of Assyria and all his forces to attack Judah. They will advance like the flood waters of the Euphrates River, overflowing all its banks. 
23Is 8:8 They will sweep through Judah in a flood, rising shoulder high and covering everything." God is with us! His outspread wings protect the land. 
23Is 8:9 Gather together in fear, you nations! Listen, you distant parts of the earth. Get ready to fight, but be afraid! Yes, get ready, but be afraid! 
23Is 8:10 Make your plans! But they will never succeed. Talk all you want to! But it is all useless, because God is with us. 
23Is 8:11 With his great power the LORD warned me not to follow the road which the people were following. He said, 
23Is 8:12 "Do not join in the schemes of the people and do not be afraid of the things that they fear. 
23Is 8:13 Remember that I, the LORD Almighty, am holy; I am the one you must fear. 
23Is 8:14 Because of my awesome holiness I am like a stone that people stumble over; I am like a trap that will catch the people of the kingdoms of Judah and Israel and the people of Jerusalem. 
23Is 8:15 Many will stumble; they will fall and be crushed. They will be caught in a trap." 
23Is 8:16 You, my disciples, are to guard and preserve the messages that God has given me. 
23Is 8:17 The LORD has hidden himself from his people, but I trust him and place my hope in him. 
23Is 8:18 Here I am with the children the LORD has given me. The LORD Almighty, whose throne is on Mount Zion, has sent us as living messages to the people of Israel. 
23Is 8:19 But people will tell you to ask for messages from fortunetellers and mediums, who chirp and mutter. They will say, "After all, people should ask for messages from the spirits and consult the dead on behalf of the living." 
23Is 8:20 You are to answer them, "Listen to what the LORD is teaching you! Don't listen to mediums - what they tell you cannot keep trouble away." 
23Is 8:21 The people will wander through the land, discouraged and hungry. In their hunger and their anger they will curse their king and their God. They may look up to the sky 
23Is 8:22 or stare at the ground, but they will see nothing but trouble and darkness, terrifying darkness into which they are being driven. 
23Is 9:1 There will be no way for them to escape from this time of trouble. The land of the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali was once disgraced, but the future will bring honor to this region, from the Mediterranean eastward to the land on the other side of the Jordan, and even to Galilee itself, where the foreigners live. 
23Is 9:2 The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light. They lived in a land of shadows, but now light is shining on them. 
23Is 9:3 You have given them great joy, Lord; you have made them happy. They rejoice in what you have done, as people rejoice when they harvest grain or when they divide captured wealth. 
23Is 9:4 For you have broken the yoke that burdened them and the rod that beat their shoulders. You have defeated the nation that oppressed and exploited your people, just as you defeated the army of Midian long ago. 
23Is 9:5 The boots of the invading army and all their bloodstained clothing will be destroyed by fire. 
23Is 9:6 A child is born to us! A son is given to us! And he will be our ruler. He will be called, "Wonderful Counselor," "Mighty God," "Eternal Father," "Prince of Peace." 
23Is 9:7 His royal power will continue to grow; his kingdom will always be at peace. He will rule as King David's successor, basing his power on right and justice, from now until the end of time. The LORD Almighty is determined to do all this. 
23Is 9:8 The Lord has pronounced judgment on the kingdom of Israel, on the descendants of Jacob. 
23Is 9:9 All the people of Israel, everyone who lives in the city of Samaria, will know that he has done this. Now they are proud and arrogant. They say, 
23Is 9:10 "The brick buildings have fallen down, but we will replace them with stone buildings. The beams of sycamore wood have been cut down, but we will replace them with the finest cedar." 
23Is 9:11 The LORD has stirred up their enemies to attack them. 
23Is 9:12 Syria on the east and Philistia on the west have opened their mouths to devour Israel. Yet even so the LORD's anger is not ended; his hand is still stretched out to punish. 
23Is 9:13 The people of Israel have not repented; even though the LORD Almighty has punished them, they have not returned to him. 
23Is 9:14 In a single day the LORD will punish Israel's leaders and its people; he will cut them off, head and tail. 
23Is 9:15 The old and honorable men are the head - and the tail is the prophets whose teachings are lies! 
23Is 9:16 Those who lead these people have misled them and totally confused them. 
23Is 9:17 And so the Lord will not let any of the young men escape, and he will not show pity on any of the widows and orphans, because all the people are godless and wicked and everything they say is evil. Yet even so the LORD's anger will not be ended, but his hand will still be stretched out to punish. 
23Is 9:18 The wickedness of the people burns like a fire that destroys thorn bushes and thistles. It burns like a forest fire that sends up columns of smoke. 
23Is 9:19 Because the LORD Almighty is angry, his punishment burns like a fire throughout the land and destroys the people, and it is each of us for ourselves. 
23Is 9:20 Everywhere in the country people snatch and eat any bit of food they can find, but their hunger is never satisfied. They even eat their own children! 
23Is 9:21 The people of Manasseh and the people of Ephraim attack each other, and together they attack Judah. Yet even so the LORD's anger is not ended; his hand is still stretched out to punish. 
23Is 10:1 You are doomed! You make unjust laws that oppress my people. 
23Is 10:2 That is how you keep the poor from having their rights and from getting justice. That is how you take the property that belongs to widows and orphans. 
23Is 10:3 What will you do when God punishes you? What will you do when he brings disaster on you from a distant country? Where will you run to find help? Where will you hide your wealth? 
23Is 10:4 You will be killed in battle or dragged off as prisoners. Yet even so the LORD's anger will not be ended; his hand will still be stretched out to punish. 
23Is 10:5 The LORD said, "Assyria! I use Assyria like a club to punish those with whom I am angry. 
23Is 10:6 I sent Assyria to attack a godless nation, people who have made me angry. I sent them to loot and steal and trample the people like dirt in the streets." 
23Is 10:7 But the Assyrian emperor has his own violent plans in mind. He is determined to destroy many nations. 
23Is 10:8 He boasts, "Every one of my commanders is a king! 
23Is 10:9 I conquered the cities of Calno and Carchemish, the cities of Hamath and Arpad. I conquered Samaria and Damascus. 
23Is 10:10 I reached out to punish those kingdoms that worship idols, idols more numerous than those of Jerusalem and Samaria. 
23Is 10:11 I have destroyed Samaria and all its idols, and I will do the same to Jerusalem and the images that are worshiped there." 
23Is 10:12 But the Lord says, "When I finish what I am doing on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, I will punish the emperor of Assyria for all his boasting and all his pride." 
23Is 10:13 The emperor of Assyria boasts, "I have done it all myself. I am strong and wise and clever. I wiped out the boundaries between nations and took the supplies they had stored. Like a bull I have trampled the people who live there. 
23Is 10:14 The nations of the world were like a bird's nest, and I gathered their wealth as easily as gathering eggs. Not a wing fluttered to scare me off; no beak opened to scream at me!" 
23Is 10:15 But the LORD says, "Can an ax claim to be greater than the one who uses it? Is a saw more important than the one who saws with it? A club doesn't lift up a person; a person lifts up a club." 
23Is 10:16 The LORD Almighty is going to send disease to punish those who are now well-fed. In their bodies there will be a fire that burns and burns. 
23Is 10:17 God, the light of Israel, will become a fire. Israel's holy God will become a flame, which in a single day will burn up everything, even the thorns and thistles. 
23Is 10:18 The rich forests and farmlands will be totally destroyed, in the same way that a fatal sickness destroys someone. 
23Is 10:19 There will be so few trees left that even a child will be able to count them. 
23Is 10:20 A time is coming when the people of Israel who have survived will not rely any more on the nation that almost destroyed them. They will truly put their trust in the LORD, Israel's holy God. 
23Is 10:21 A few of the people of Israel will come back to their mighty God. 
23Is 10:22 Even though now there are as many people of Israel as there are grains of sand by the sea, only a few will come back. Destruction is in store for the people, and it is fully deserved. 
23Is 10:23 Yes, throughout the whole country the Sovereign LORD Almighty will bring destruction, as he said he would. 
23Is 10:24 The Sovereign LORD Almighty says to his people who live in Zion, "Do not be afraid of the Assyrians, even though they oppress you as the Egyptians used to do. 
23Is 10:25 In only a little while I will finish punishing you, and then I will destroy them. 
23Is 10:26 I, the LORD Almighty, will beat them with my whip as I did the people of Midian at Oreb Rock. I will punish Assyria as I punished Egypt. 
23Is 10:27 When that time comes, I will free you from the power of Assyria, and their yoke will no longer be a burden on your shoulders." 
23Is 10:28 The enemy army has captured the city of Ai! They have passed through Migron! They left their supplies at Michmash! 
23Is 10:29 They have crossed the pass and are spending the night at Geba! The people in the town of Ramah are terrified, and the people in King Saul's hometown of Gibeah have run away. 
23Is 10:30 Shout, people of Gallim! Listen, people of Laishah! Answer, people of Anathoth! 
23Is 10:31 The people of Madmenah and Gebim are running for their lives. 
23Is 10:32 Today the enemy are in the town of Nob, and there they are shaking their fists at Mount Zion, at the city of Jerusalem. 
23Is 10:33 The LORD Almighty will bring them crashing down like branches cut off a tree. The proudest and highest of them will be cut down and humiliated. 
23Is 10:34 The LORD will cut them down as trees in the heart of the forest are cut down with an ax, as even the finest trees of Lebanon fall! 
23Is 11:1 The royal line of David is like a tree that has been cut down; but just as new branches sprout from a stump, so a new king will arise from among David's descendants. 
23Is 11:2 The spirit of the LORD will give him wisdom and the knowledge and skill to rule his people. He will know the LORD's will and honor him, 
23Is 11:3 and find pleasure in obeying him. He will not judge by appearance or hearsay; 
23Is 11:4 he will judge the poor fairly and defend the rights of the helpless. At his command the people will be punished, and evil persons will die. 
23Is 11:5 He will rule his people with justice and integrity. 
23Is 11:6 Wolves and sheep will live together in peace, and leopards will lie down with young goats. Calves and lion cubs will feed together, and little children will take care of them. 
23Is 11:7 Cows and bears will eat together, and their calves and cubs will lie down in peace. Lions will eat straw as cattle do. 
23Is 11:8 Even a baby will not be harmed if it plays near a poisonous snake. 
23Is 11:9 On Zion, God's sacred hill, there will be nothing harmful or evil. The land will be as full of knowledge of the LORD as the seas are full of water. 
23Is 11:10 A day is coming when the new king from the royal line of David will be a symbol to the nations. They will gather in his royal city and give him honor. 
23Is 11:11 When that day comes, the Lord will once again use his power and bring back home those of his people who are left in Assyria and Egypt, in the lands of Pathros, Ethiopia, Elam, Babylonia, and Hamath, and in the coastlands and on the islands of the sea. 
23Is 11:12 The Lord will raise a signal flag to show the nations that he is gathering together again the scattered people of Israel and Judah and bringing them back from the four corners of the earth. 
23Is 11:13 The kingdom of Israel will not be jealous of Judah any more, and Judah will not be the enemy of Israel. 
23Is 11:14 Together they will attack the Philistines on the west and plunder the people who live to the east. They will conquer the people of Edom and Moab, and the people of Ammon will obey them. 
23Is 11:15 The LORD will dry up the Gulf of Suez, and he will bring a hot wind to dry up the Euphrates, leaving only seven tiny streams, so that anyone can walk across. 
23Is 11:16 There will be a highway out of Assyria for those of his people Israel who have survived there, just as there was for their ancestors when they left Egypt. 
23Is 12:1 A day is coming when people will sing, "I praise you, LORD! You were angry with me, but now you comfort me and are angry no longer. 
23Is 12:2 God is my savior; I will trust him and not be afraid. The LORD gives me power and strength; he is my savior. 
23Is 12:3 As fresh water brings joy to the thirsty, so God's people rejoice when he saves them." 
23Is 12:4 A day is coming when people will sing, "Give thanks to the LORD! Call for him to help you! Tell all the nations what he has done! Tell them how great he is! 
23Is 12:5 Sing to the LORD because of the great things he has done. Let the whole world hear the news. 
23Is 12:6 Let everyone who lives in Zion shout and sing! Israel's holy God is great, and he lives among his people." 
23Is 13:1 This is a message about Babylon, which Isaiah son of Amoz received from God. 
23Is 13:2 On the top of a barren hill raise the battle flag! Shout to the soldiers and raise your arm as the signal for them to attack the gates of the proud city. 
23Is 13:3 The LORD has called out his proud and confident soldiers to fight a holy war and punish those he is angry with. 
23Is 13:4 Listen to the noise on the mountains - the sound of a great crowd of people, the sound of nations and kingdoms gathering. The LORD of Armies is preparing his troops for battle. 
23Is 13:5 They are coming from far-off countries at the ends of the earth. In his anger the LORD is coming to devastate the whole country. 
23Is 13:6 Howl in pain! The day of the LORD is near, the day when the Almighty brings destruction. 
23Is 13:7 Everyone's hands will hang limp, and everyone's courage will fail. 
23Is 13:8 They will all be terrified and overcome with pain, like the pain of a woman in labor. They will look at each other in fear, and their faces will burn with shame. 
23Is 13:9 The day of the LORD is coming - that cruel day of his fierce anger and fury. The earth will be made a wilderness, and every sinner will be destroyed. 
23Is 13:10 Every star and every constellation will stop shining, the sun will be dark when it rises, and the moon will give no light. 
23Is 13:11 The LORD says, "I will bring disaster on the earth and punish all wicked people for their sins. I will humble everyone who is proud and punish everyone who is arrogant and cruel. 
23Is 13:12 Those who survive will be scarcer than gold. 
23Is 13:13 I will make the heavens tremble, and the earth will be shaken out of its place on that day when I, the LORD Almighty, show my anger. 
23Is 13:14 "The foreigners living in Babylon will run away to their homelands, scattering like deer escaping from hunters, like sheep without a shepherd. 
23Is 13:15 Anyone who is caught will be stabbed to death. 
23Is 13:16 While they look on helplessly, their babies will be battered to death, their houses will be looted, and their wives will be raped." 
23Is 13:17 The LORD says, "I am stirring up the Medes to attack Babylon. They care nothing for silver and are not tempted by gold. 
23Is 13:18 With their bows and arrows they will kill the young men. They will show no mercy to babies and take no pity on children. 
23Is 13:19 Babylonia is the most beautiful kingdom of all; it is the pride of its people. But I, the LORD, will overthrow Babylon as I did Sodom and Gomorrah! 
23Is 13:20 No one will ever live there again. No wandering Arab will ever pitch a tent there, and no shepherd will ever pasture a flock there. 
23Is 13:21 It will be a place where desert animals live and where owls build their nests. Ostriches will live there, and wild goats will prance through the ruins. 
23Is 13:22 The towers and palaces will echo with the cries of hyenas and jackals. Babylon's time has come! Her days are almost over." 
23Is 14:1 The LORD will once again be merciful to his people Israel and choose them as his own. He will let them live in their own land again, and foreigners will come and live there with them. 
23Is 14:2 Many nations will help the people of Israel return to the land which the LORD gave them, and there the nations will serve Israel as slaves. Those who once captured Israel will now be captured by Israel, and the people of Israel will rule over those who once oppressed them. 
23Is 14:3 The LORD will give the people of Israel relief from their pain and suffering and from the hard work they were forced to do. 
23Is 14:4 When he does this, they are to mock the king of Babylon and say�� "The cruel king has fallen! He will never oppress anyone again! 
23Is 14:5 The LORD has ended the power of the evil rulers 
23Is 14:6 who angrily oppressed the peoples and never stopped persecuting the nations they had conquered. 
23Is 14:7 Now at last the whole world enjoys rest and peace, and everyone sings for joy. 
23Is 14:8 The cypress trees and the cedars of Lebanon rejoice over the fallen king, because there is no one to cut them down, now that he is gone! 
23Is 14:9 "The world of the dead is getting ready to welcome the king of Babylon. The ghosts of those who were powerful on earth are stirring about. The ghosts of kings are rising from their thrones. 
23Is 14:10 They all call out to him, 'Now you are as weak as we are! You are one of us! 
23Is 14:11 You used to be honored with the music of harps, but now here you are in the world of the dead. You lie on a bed of maggots and are covered with a blanket of worms.' " 
23Is 14:12 King of Babylon, bright morning star, you have fallen from heaven! In the past you conquered nations, but now you have been thrown to the ground. 
23Is 14:13 You were determined to climb up to heaven and to place your throne above the highest stars. You thought you would sit like a king on that mountain in the north where the gods assemble. 
23Is 14:14 You said you would climb to the tops of the clouds and be like the Almighty. 
23Is 14:15 But instead, you have been brought down to the deepest part of the world of the dead. 
23Is 14:16 The dead will stare and gape at you. They will ask, "Is this the man who shook the earth and made kingdoms tremble? 
23Is 14:17 Is this the man who destroyed cities and turned the world into a desert? Is this the man who never freed his prisoners or let them go home?" 
23Is 14:18 All the kings of the earth lie in their magnificent tombs, 
23Is 14:19 but you have no tomb, and your corpse is thrown out to rot. It is covered by the bodies of soldiers killed in battle, thrown with them into a rocky pit, and trampled down. 
23Is 14:20 Because you ruined your country and killed your own people, you will not be buried like other kings. None of your evil family will survive. 
23Is 14:21 Let the slaughter begin! The sons of this king will die because of their ancestors' sins. None of them will ever rule the earth or cover it with cities. 
23Is 14:22 The LORD Almighty says, "I will attack Babylon and bring it to ruin. I will leave nothing - no children, no survivors at all. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
23Is 14:23 I will turn Babylon into a marsh, and owls will live there. I will sweep Babylon with a broom that will sweep everything away. I, the LORD Almighty, have spoken." 
23Is 14:24 The LORD Almighty has sworn an oath�� "What I have planned will happen. What I have determined to do will be done. 
23Is 14:25 I will destroy the Assyrians in my land of Israel and trample them on my mountains. I will free my people from the Assyrian yoke and from the burdens they have had to bear. 
23Is 14:26 This is my plan for the world, and my arm is stretched out to punish the nations." 
23Is 14:27 The LORD Almighty is determined to do this; he has stretched out his arm to punish, and no one can stop him. 
23Is 14:28 This is a message that was proclaimed in the year that King Ahaz died. 
23Is 14:29 People of Philistia, the rod that beat you is broken, but you have no reason to be glad. When one snake dies, a worse one comes in its place. A snake's egg hatches a flying dragon. 
23Is 14:30 The LORD will be a shepherd to the poor of his people and will let them live in safety. But he will send a terrible famine on you Philistines, and it will not leave any of you alive. 
23Is 14:31 Howl and cry for help, all you Philistine cities! Be terrified, all of you! A cloud of dust is coming from the north - it is an army with no cowards in its ranks. 
23Is 14:32 How shall we answer the messengers that come to us from Philistia? We will tell them that the LORD has established Zion and that his suffering people will find safety there. 
23Is 15:1 This is a message about Moab. The cities of Ar and Kir are destroyed in a single night, and silence covers the land of Moab. 
23Is 15:2 The people of Dibon climb the hill to weep at the shrine. The people of Moab wail in grief over the cities of Nebo and Medeba; they have shaved their heads and their beards in grief. 
23Is 15:3 The people in the streets are dressed in sackcloth; in the city squares and on the rooftops people mourn and cry. 
23Is 15:4 The people of Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, and their cry can be heard as far away as Jahaz. Even the soldiers tremble; their courage is gone. 
23Is 15:5 My heart cries out for Moab! The people have fled to the town of Zoar, and to Eglath Shelishiyah. Some climb the road to Luhith, weeping as they go; some escape to Horonaim, grieving loudly. 
23Is 15:6 Nimrim Brook is dry, the grass beside it has withered, and nothing green is left. 
23Is 15:7 The people go across the Valley of Willows, trying to escape with all their possessions. 
23Is 15:8 Everywhere at Moab's borders the sound of crying is heard. It is heard at the towns of Eglaim and Beerelim. 
23Is 15:9 At the town of Dibon the river is red with blood, and God has something even worse in store for the people there. Yes, there will be a bloody slaughter of everyone left in Moab. 
23Is 16:1 From the city of Sela in the desert the people of Moab send a lamb as a present to the one who rules in Jerusalem. 
23Is 16:2 They wait on the banks of the Arnon River and move aimlessly back and forth, like birds driven from their nest. 
23Is 16:3 They say to the people of Judah, "Tell us what to do. Protect us like a tree that casts a cool shadow in the heat of noon, and let us rest in your shade. We are refugees; hide us where no one can find us. 
23Is 16:4 Let us stay in your land. Protect us from those who want to destroy us." (Oppression and destruction will end, and those who are devastating the country will be gone. 
23Is 16:5 Then one of David's descendants will be king, and he will rule the people with faithfulness and love. He will be quick to do what is right, and he will see that justice is done.) 
23Is 16:6 The people of Judah say, "We have heard how proud the people of Moab are. We know that they are arrogant and conceited, but their boasts are empty." 
23Is 16:7 The people of Moab will weep because of the troubles they suffer. They will all weep when they remember the fine food they used to eat in the city of Kir Heres. They will be driven to despair. 
23Is 16:8 The farms near Heshbon and the vineyards of Sibmah are destroyed - those vineyards whose wine used to make the rulers of the nations drunk. At one time the vines spread as far as the city of Jazer, and eastward into the desert, and westward to the other side of the Dead Sea. 
23Is 16:9 Now I weep for Sibmah's vines as I weep for Jazer. My tears fall for Heshbon and Elealeh, because there is no harvest to make the people glad. 
23Is 16:10 No one is happy now in the fertile fields. No one shouts or sings in the vineyards. No one tramples grapes to make wine; the shouts of joy are ended. 
23Is 16:11 I groan with sadness for Moab, with grief for Kir Heres. 
23Is 16:12 The people of Moab wear themselves out going to their mountain shrines and to their temples to pray, but it will do them no good. 
23Is 16:13 That is the message the LORD gave earlier about Moab. 
23Is 16:14 And now the LORD says, "In exactly three years Moab's great wealth will disappear. Of its many people, only a few will survive, and they will be weak." 
23Is 17:1 The LORD said, "Damascus will not be a city any longer; it will be only a pile of ruins. 
23Is 17:2 The cities of Syria will be deserted forever. They will be a pasture for sheep and cattle, and no one will drive them away. 
23Is 17:3 Israel will be defenseless, and Damascus will lose its independence. Those Syrians who survive will be in disgrace like the people of Israel. I, the LORD Almighty, have spoken." 
23Is 17:4 The LORD said, "A day is coming when Israel's greatness will come to an end, and its wealth will be replaced by poverty. 
23Is 17:5 Israel will be like a field where the grain has been cut and harvested, as desolate as a field in Rephaim Valley when it has been picked bare. 
23Is 17:6 Only a few people will survive, and Israel will be like an olive tree from which all the olives have been picked except two or three at the very top, or a few that are left on the lower branches. I, the LORD God of Israel, have spoken." 
23Is 17:7 When that day comes, people will turn for help to their Creator, the holy God of Israel. 
23Is 17:8 They will no longer rely on the altars they made with their own hands, or trust in their own handiwork - symbols of the goddess Asherah and altars for burning incense. 
23Is 17:9 When that day comes, well-defended cities will be deserted and left in ruins like the cities that the Hivites and the Amorites abandoned as they fled from the people of Israel. 
23Is 17:10 Israel, you have forgotten the God who rescues you and protects you like a mighty rock. Instead, you plant sacred gardens in order to worship a foreign god. 
23Is 17:11 But even if they sprouted and blossomed the very morning you planted them, there would still be no harvest. There would be only trouble and incurable pain. 
23Is 17:12 Powerful nations are in commotion with a sound like the roar of the sea, like the crashing of huge waves. 
23Is 17:13 The nations advance like rushing waves, but God reprimands them and they retreat, driven away like dust on a mountainside, like straw in a whirlwind. 
23Is 17:14 At evening they cause terror, but by morning they are gone. That is the fate of everyone who plunders our land. 
23Is 18:1 Beyond the rivers of Ethiopia there is a land where the sound of wings is heard. 
23Is 18:2 From that land ambassadors come down the Nile in boats made of reeds. Go back home, swift messengers! Take a message back to your land divided by rivers, to your strong and powerful nation, to your tall and smooth-skinned people, who are feared all over the world. 
23Is 18:3 Listen, everyone who lives on earth! Look for a signal flag to be raised on the mountaintops! Listen for the blowing of the bugle! 
23Is 18:4 The LORD said to me, "I will look down from heaven as quietly as the dew forms in the warm nights of harvest time, as serenely as the sun shines in the heat of the day. 
23Is 18:5 Before the grapes are gathered, when the blossoms have all fallen and the grapes are ripening, the enemy will destroy the Ethiopians as easily as a knife cuts branches from a vine. 
23Is 18:6 The corpses of their soldiers will be left exposed to the birds and the wild animals. In summer the birds will feed on them, and in winter, the animals." 
23Is 18:7 A time is coming when the LORD Almighty will receive offerings from this land divided by rivers, this strong and powerful nation, this tall and smooth-skinned people, who are feared all over the world. They will come to Mount Zion, where the LORD Almighty is worshiped. 
23Is 19:1 This is a message about Egypt. The LORD is coming to Egypt, riding swiftly on a cloud. The Egyptian idols tremble before him, and the people of Egypt lose their courage. 
23Is 19:2 The LORD says, "I will stir up civil war in Egypt and turn brother against brother and neighbor against neighbor. Rival cities will fight each other, and rival kings will struggle for power. 
23Is 19:3 I am going to frustrate the plans of the Egyptians and destroy their morale. They will ask their idols to help them, and they will go and consult mediums and ask the spirits of the dead for advice. 
23Is 19:4 I will hand the Egyptians over to a tyrant, to a cruel king who will rule them. I, the LORD Almighty, have spoken." 
23Is 19:5 The water will be low in the Nile, and the river will gradually dry up. 
23Is 19:6 The channels of the river will stink as they slowly go dry. Reeds and rushes will wither, 
23Is 19:7 and all the crops planted along the banks of the Nile will dry up and be blown away. 
23Is 19:8 Everyone who earns a living by fishing in the Nile will groan and cry; their hooks and their nets will be useless. 
23Is 19:9 Those who make linen cloth will be in despair; 
23Is 19:10 weavers and skilled workers will be broken and depressed. 
23Is 19:11 The leaders of the city of Zoan are fools! Egypt's wisest people give stupid advice! How do they dare to tell the king that they are successors to the ancient scholars and kings? 
23Is 19:12 King of Egypt, where are those clever advisers of yours? Perhaps they can tell you what plans the LORD Almighty has for Egypt. 
23Is 19:13 The leaders of Zoan and Memphis are fools. They were supposed to lead the nation, but they have misled it. 
23Is 19:14 The LORD has made them give confusing advice. As a result, Egypt does everything wrong and staggers like a drunk slipping on his own vomit. 
23Is 19:15 No one in Egypt, rich or poor, important or unknown, can offer help. 
23Is 19:16 A time is coming when the people of Egypt will be as timid as women. They will tremble in terror when they see that the LORD Almighty has stretched out his hand to punish them. 
23Is 19:17 The people of Egypt will be terrified of Judah every time they are reminded of the fate that the LORD Almighty has prepared for them. 
23Is 19:18 When that time comes, the Hebrew language will be spoken in five Egyptian cities. The people there will take their oaths in the name of the LORD Almighty. One of the cities will be called, "City of the Sun." 
23Is 19:19 When that time comes, there will be an altar to the LORD in the land of Egypt and a stone pillar dedicated to him at the Egyptian border. 
23Is 19:20 They will be symbols of the LORD Almighty's presence in Egypt. When the people there are oppressed and call out to the LORD for help, he will send someone to rescue them. 
23Is 19:21 The LORD will reveal himself to the Egyptian people, and then they will acknowledge and worship him, and bring him sacrifices and offerings. They will make solemn promises to him and do what they promise. 
23Is 19:22 The LORD will punish the Egyptians, but then he will heal them. They will turn to him, and he will hear their prayers and heal them. 
23Is 19:23 When that time comes, there will be a highway between Egypt and Assyria. The people of these two countries will travel back and forth between them, and the two nations will worship together. 
23Is 19:24 When that time comes, Israel will rank with Egypt and Assyria, and these three nations will be a blessing to all the world. 
23Is 19:25 The LORD Almighty will bless them and say, "I will bless you, Egypt, my people; you, Assyria, whom I created; and you, Israel, my chosen people." 
23Is 20:1 Under the orders of Emperor Sargon of Assyria, the commander-in-chief of the Assyrian army attacked the Philistine city of Ashdod. 
23Is 20:2 Three years earlier the LORD had told Isaiah son of Amoz to take off his sandals and the sackcloth he was wearing. He obeyed and went around naked and barefoot. 
23Is 20:3 When Ashdod was captured, the LORD said, "My servant Isaiah has been going around naked and barefoot for three years. This is a sign of what will happen to Egypt and Ethiopia. 
23Is 20:4 The emperor of Assyria will lead away naked the prisoners he captures from those two countries. Young and old, they will walk barefoot and naked, with their buttocks exposed, bringing shame on Egypt. 
23Is 20:5 Those who have put their trust in Ethiopia and have boasted about Egypt will be disillusioned, their hopes shattered. 
23Is 20:6 When that time comes, the people who live along the coast of Philistia will say, 'Look at what has happened to the people we relied on to protect us from the emperor of Assyria! How will we ever survive?' " 
23Is 21:1 This is a message about Babylonia. Like a whirlwind sweeping across the desert, disaster will come from a terrifying land. 
23Is 21:2 I have seen a vision of cruel events, a vision of betrayal and destruction. Army of Elam, attack! Army of Media, lay siege to the cities! God will put an end to the suffering which Babylon has caused. 
23Is 21:3 What I saw and heard in the vision has filled me with terror and pain, pain like that of a woman in labor. 
23Is 21:4 My head is spinning, and I am trembling with fear. I had been longing for evening to come, but it has brought me nothing but terror. 
23Is 21:5 In the vision a banquet is ready; rugs are spread for the guests to sit on. They are eating and drinking. Suddenly the command rings out�� "Officers! Prepare your shields!" 
23Is 21:6 Then the Lord said to me, "Go and post a sentry, and tell him to report what he sees. 
23Is 21:7 If he sees riders coming on horseback, two by two, and riders on donkeys and camels, he is to observe them carefully." 
23Is 21:8 The sentry calls out, "Sir, I have been standing guard at my post day and night." 
23Is 21:9 Suddenly, here they come! Riders on horseback, two by two. The sentry gives the news, "Babylon has fallen! All the idols they worshiped lie shattered on the ground." 
23Is 21:10 My people Israel, you have been threshed like wheat, but now I have announced to you the good news that I have heard from the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel. 
23Is 21:11 This is a message about Edom. Someone calls to me from Edom, "Sentry, how soon will the night be over? Tell me how soon it will end." 
23Is 21:12 I answer, "Morning is coming, but night will come again. If you want to ask again, come back and ask." 
23Is 21:13 This is a message about Arabia. People of Dedan, you whose caravans camp in the barren country of Arabia, 
23Is 21:14 give water to the thirsty people who come to you. You people of the land of Tema, give food to the refugees. 
23Is 21:15 People are fleeing to escape from swords that are ready to kill them, from bows that are ready to shoot, from all the dangers of war. 
23Is 21:16 Then the Lord said to me, "In exactly one year the greatness of the tribes of Kedar will be at an end. 
23Is 21:17 The archers are the bravest warriors of Kedar, but few of them will be left. I, the LORD God of Israel, have spoken." 
23Is 22:1 This is a message about the Valley of Vision. What is happening? Why are all the people of the city celebrating on the roofs of the houses? 
23Is 22:2 The whole city is in an uproar, filled with noise and excitement. Your people who died in this war did not die fighting. 
23Is 22:3 All your leaders ran away and were captured before they shot a single arrow. 
23Is 22:4 Now leave me alone to weep bitterly over all those of my people who have died. Don't try to comfort me. 
23Is 22:5 This is a time of panic, defeat, and confusion in the Valley of Vision, and the Sovereign LORD Almighty has sent it on us. The walls of our city have been battered down, and cries for help have echoed among the hills. 
23Is 22:6 The soldiers from the land of Elam came riding on horseback, armed with bows and arrows. Soldiers from the land of Kir had their shields ready. 
23Is 22:7 The fertile valleys of Judah were filled with chariots; soldiers on horseback stood in front of Jerusalem's gates. 
23Is 22:8 All of Judah's defenses crumbled. When that happened, you brought weapons out of the arsenal. 
23Is 22:9 You found the places where the walls of Jerusalem needed repair. 
23Is 22:10 You inspected all the houses in Jerusalem and tore some of them down to get stones to repair the city walls. In order to store water, 
23Is 22:11 you built a reservoir inside the city to hold the water flowing down from the old pool. But you paid no attention to God, who planned all this long ago and who caused it to happen. 
23Is 22:12 The Sovereign LORD Almighty was calling you then to weep and mourn, to shave your heads and wear sackcloth. 
23Is 22:13 Instead, you laughed and celebrated. You killed sheep and cattle to eat, and you drank wine. You said, "We might as well eat and drink! Tomorrow we'll be dead." 
23Is 22:14 The Sovereign LORD Almighty himself spoke to me and said, "This evil will never be forgiven them as long as they live. I, the Sovereign LORD Almighty, have spoken." 
23Is 22:15 The Sovereign LORD Almighty told me to go to Shebna, the manager of the royal household, and say to him, 
23Is 22:16 "Who do you think you are? What right do you have to carve a tomb for yourself out of the rocky hillside? 
23Is 22:17 You may be important, but the LORD will pick you up and throw you away. 
23Is 22:18 He will pick you up like a ball and throw you into a much larger country. You will die there beside the chariots you were so proud of. You are a disgrace to your master's household. 
23Is 22:19 The LORD will remove you from office and bring you down from your high position." 
23Is 22:20 The LORD said to Shebna, "When that happens, I will send for my servant Eliakim son of Hilkiah. 
23Is 22:21 I will put your official robe and belt on him and give him all the authority you have had. He will be like a father to the people of Jerusalem and Judah. 
23Is 22:22 I will give him complete authority under the king, the descendant of David. He will have the keys of office; what he opens, no one will shut, and what he shuts, no one will open. 
23Is 22:23 I will fasten him firmly in place like a peg, and he will be a source of honor to his whole family. 
23Is 22:24 "But all his relatives and dependents will become a burden to him. They will hang on him like pots and bowls hanging from a peg! 
23Is 22:25 When that happens, the peg that was firmly fastened will pull loose and fall. And that will be the end of everything that was hanging on it." The LORD has spoken. 
23Is 23:1 This is a message about Tyre. Howl with grief, you sailors out on the ocean! Your home port of Tyre has been destroyed; its houses and its harbor are in ruins. As your ships return from Cyprus, you learn the news. 
23Is 23:2 Wail, you merchants of Sidon! You sent agents 
23Is 23:3 across the sea to buy and sell the grain that grew in Egypt and to do business with all the nations. 
23Is 23:4 City of Sidon, you are disgraced! The sea and the great ocean depths disown you and say, "I never had any children. I never raised sons or daughters." 
23Is 23:5 Even the Egyptians will be shocked and dismayed when they learn that Tyre has been destroyed. 
23Is 23:6 Howl with grief, you people of Phoenicia! Try to escape to Spain! 
23Is 23:7 Can this be the joyful city of Tyre, founded so long ago? Is this the city that sent settlers across the sea to establish colonies? 
23Is 23:8 Who was it that planned to bring all this on Tyre, that imperial city, whose merchant princes were the most honored men on earth? 
23Is 23:9 The LORD Almighty planned it. He planned it in order to put an end to their pride in what they had done and to humiliate their honored ones. 
23Is 23:10 Go and farm the land, you people in the colonies in Spain! There is no one to protect you any more. 
23Is 23:11 The LORD has stretched out his hand over the sea and overthrown kingdoms. He has commanded that the Phoenician centers of commerce be destroyed. 
23Is 23:12 City of Sidon, your happiness has ended, and your people are oppressed. Even if they escape to Cyprus, they will still not be safe. 
23Is 23:13 (It was the Babylonians, not the Assyrians, who let the wild animals overrun Tyre. It was the Babylonians who put up siege towers, tore down the fortifications of Tyre, and left the city in ruins. ) 
23Is 23:14 Howl with grief, you sailors out on the ocean! The city you relied on has been destroyed. 
23Is 23:15 A time is coming when Tyre will be forgotten for seventy years, the lifetime of a king. When those years are over, Tyre will be like the prostitute in the song�� 
23Is 23:16 Take your harp, go round the town, you poor forgotten whore! Play and sing your songs again to bring men back once more. 
23Is 23:17 When the seventy years are over, the LORD will let Tyre go back to her old trade, and she will hire herself out to all the kingdoms of the world. 
23Is 23:18 The money she earns by commerce will be dedicated to the LORD. She will not store it away, but those who worship the LORD will use her money to buy the food and the clothing they need. 
23Is 24:1 The LORD is going to devastate the earth and leave it desolate. He will twist the earth's surface and scatter its people. 
23Is 24:2 Everyone will meet the same fate - the priests and the people, slaves and masters, buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers, rich and poor. 
23Is 24:3 The earth will lie shattered and ruined. The LORD has spoken and it will be done. 
23Is 24:4 The earth dries up and withers; the whole world grows weak; both earth and sky decay. 
23Is 24:5 The people have defiled the earth by breaking God's laws and by violating the covenant he made to last forever. 
23Is 24:6 So God has pronounced a curse on the earth. Its people are paying for what they have done. Fewer and fewer remain alive. 
23Is 24:7 The grapevines wither, and wine is becoming scarce. Everyone who was once happy is now sad, 
23Is 24:8 and the joyful music of their harps and drums has ceased. 
23Is 24:9 There is no more happy singing over wine; no one enjoys its taste any more. 
23Is 24:10 In the city everything is in chaos, and people lock themselves in their houses for safety. 
23Is 24:11 People shout in the streets because there is no more wine. Happiness is gone forever; it has been banished from the land. 
23Is 24:12 The city is in ruins, and its gates have been broken down. 
23Is 24:13 This is what will happen in every nation all over the world. It will be like the end of harvest, when the olives have been beaten off every tree and the last grapes picked from the vines. 
23Is 24:14 Those who survive will sing for joy. Those in the West will tell how great the LORD is, 
23Is 24:15 and those in the East will praise him. The people who live along the sea will praise the LORD, the God of Israel. 
23Is 24:16 From the most distant parts of the world we will hear songs in praise of Israel, the righteous nation. But there is no hope for me! I am wasting away! Traitors continue to betray, and their treachery grows worse and worse. 
23Is 24:17 Listen to me, everyone! There are terrors, pits, and traps waiting for you. 
23Is 24:18 Anyone who tries to escape from the terror will fall in a pit, and anyone who escapes from the pit will be caught in a trap. Torrents of rain will pour from the sky, and earth's foundations will shake. 
23Is 24:19 The earth will crack and shatter and split open. 
23Is 24:20 The earth itself will stagger like a drunk, sway like a hut in a storm. The world is weighed down by its sins; it will collapse and never rise again. 
23Is 24:21 A time is coming when the LORD will punish the powers above and the rulers of the earth. 
23Is 24:22 God will crowd kings together like prisoners in a pit. He will shut them in prison until the time of their punishment comes. 
23Is 24:23 The moon will grow dark, and the sun will no longer shine, for the LORD Almighty will be king. He will rule in Jerusalem on Mount Zion, and the leaders of the people will see his glory. 
23Is 25:1 LORD, you are my God; I will honor you and praise your name. You have done amazing things; you have faithfully carried out the plans you made long ago. 
23Is 25:2 You have turned cities into ruins and destroyed their fortifications. The palaces which our enemies built are gone forever. 
23Is 25:3 The people of powerful nations will praise you; you will be feared in the cities of cruel nations. 
23Is 25:4 The poor and the helpless have fled to you and have been safe in times of trouble. You give them shelter from storms and shade from the burning heat. Cruel enemies attack like a winter storm, 
23Is 25:5 like drought in a dry land. But you, LORD, have silenced our enemies; you silence the shouts of cruel people, as a cloud cools a hot day. 
23Is 25:6 Here on Mount Zion the LORD Almighty will prepare a banquet for all the nations of the world - a banquet of the richest food and the finest wine. 
23Is 25:7 Here he will suddenly remove the cloud of sorrow that has been hanging over all the nations. 
23Is 25:8 The Sovereign LORD will destroy death forever! He will wipe away the tears from everyone's eyes and take away the disgrace his people have suffered throughout the world. The LORD himself has spoken. 
23Is 25:9 When it happens, everyone will say, "He is our God! We have put our trust in him, and he has rescued us. He is the LORD! We have put our trust in him, and now we are happy and joyful because he has saved us." 
23Is 25:10 The LORD will protect Mount Zion, but the people of Moab will be trampled down the way straw is trampled in manure. 
23Is 25:11 They will reach out their hands as if they were trying to swim, but God will humiliate them, and their hands will sink helplessly. 
23Is 25:12 He will destroy the fortresses of Moab with their high walls and bring them tumbling down into the dust. 
23Is 26:1 A day is coming when the people will sing this song in the land of Judah�� Our city is strong! God himself defends its walls! 
23Is 26:2 Open the city gates and let the faithful nation enter, the nation whose people do what is right. 
23Is 26:3 You, LORD, give perfect peace to those who keep their purpose firm and put their trust in you. 
23Is 26:4 Trust in the LORD forever; he will always protect us. 
23Is 26:5 He has humbled those who were proud; he destroyed the strong city they lived in, and sent its walls crashing into the dust. 
23Is 26:6 Those who were oppressed walk over it now and trample it under their feet. 
23Is 26:7 LORD, you make the path smooth for good people; the road they travel is level. 
23Is 26:8 We follow your will and put our hope in you; you are all that we desire. 
23Is 26:9 At night I long for you with all my heart; when you judge the earth and its people, they will all learn what justice is. 
23Is 26:10 Even though you are kind to the wicked, they never learn to do what is right. Even here in a land of righteous people they still do wrong; they refuse to recognize your greatness. 
23Is 26:11 Your enemies do not know that you will punish them. LORD, put them to shame and let them suffer; let them suffer the punishment you have prepared. Show them how much you love your people. 
23Is 26:12 You will give us prosperity, LORD; everything that we achieve is the result of what you do. 
23Is 26:13 LORD our God, we have been ruled by others, but you alone are our LORD. 
23Is 26:14 Now they are dead and will not live again; their ghosts will not rise, for you have punished them and destroyed them. No one remembers them any more. 
23Is 26:15 LORD, you have made our nation grow, enlarging its territory on every side; and this has brought you honor. 
23Is 26:16 You punished your people, LORD, and in anguish they prayed to you. 
23Is 26:17 You, LORD, have made us cry out, as a woman in labor cries out in pain. 
23Is 26:18 We were in pain and agony, but we gave birth to nothing. We have won no victory for our land; we have accomplished nothing. 
23Is 26:19 Those of our people who have died will live again! Their bodies will come back to life. All those sleeping in their graves will wake up and sing for joy. As the sparkling dew refreshes the earth, so the LORD will revive those who have long been dead. 
23Is 26:20 Go into your houses, my people, and shut the door behind you. Hide yourselves for a little while until God's anger is over. 
23Is 26:21 The LORD is coming from his heavenly dwelling place to punish the people of the earth for their sins. The murders that were secretly committed on the earth will be revealed, and the ground will no longer hide those who have been killed. 
23Is 27:1 On that day the LORD will use his powerful and deadly sword to punish Leviathan, that wriggling, twisting dragon, and to kill the monster that lives in the sea. 
23Is 27:2 On that day the LORD will say of his pleasant vineyard, 
23Is 27:3 "I watch over it and water it continually. I guard it night and day so that no one will harm it. 
23Is 27:4 I am no longer angry with the vineyard. If there were thorns and briers to fight against, I would burn them up completely. 
23Is 27:5 But if the enemies of my people want my protection, let them make peace with me. Yes, let them make peace with me." 
23Is 27:6 In the days to come the people of Israel, the descendants of Jacob, will take root like a tree, and they will blossom and bud. The earth will be covered with the fruit they produce. 
23Is 27:7 Israel has not been punished by the LORD as severely as its enemies nor lost as many people. 
23Is 27:8 The LORD punished his people by sending them into exile. He took them away with a cruel wind from the east. 
23Is 27:9 But Israel's sins will be forgiven only when the stones of pagan altars are ground up like chalk, and no more incense altars or symbols of the goddess Asherah are left. 
23Is 27:10 The fortified city lies in ruins. It is deserted like an empty wilderness. It has become a pasture for cattle, where they can rest and graze. 
23Is 27:11 The branches of the trees are withered and broken, and women gather them for firewood. Because the people have understood nothing, God their Creator will not pity them or show them any mercy. 
23Is 27:12 On that day, from the Euphrates to the Egyptian border, the LORD will gather his people one by one, as threshing separates the wheat from the chaff. 
23Is 27:13 When that day comes, a trumpet will be blown to call back from Assyria and Egypt all the Israelites who are in exile there. They will come and worship the LORD in Jerusalem, on his sacred hill. 
23Is 28:1 The kingdom of Israel is doomed! Its glory is fading like the crowns of flowers on the heads of its drunken leaders. Their proud heads are well perfumed, but there they lie, dead drunk. 
23Is 28:2 The Lord has someone strong and powerful ready to attack them, someone who will come like a hailstorm, like a torrent of rain, like a rushing, overpowering flood, and will overwhelm the land. 
23Is 28:3 The pride of those drunken leaders will be trampled underfoot. 
23Is 28:4 The fading glory of those proud leaders will disappear like the first figs of the season, picked and eaten as soon as they are ripe. 
23Is 28:5 A day is coming when the LORD Almighty will be like a glorious crown of flowers for his people who survive. 
23Is 28:6 He will give a sense of justice to those who serve as judges, and courage to those who defend the city gates from attack. 
23Is 28:7 Even the prophets and the priests are so drunk that they stagger. They have drunk so much wine and liquor that they stumble in confusion. The prophets are too drunk to understand the visions that God sends, and the priests are too drunk to decide the cases that are brought to them. 
23Is 28:8 The tables where they sit are all covered with vomit, and not a clean spot is left. 
23Is 28:9 They complain about me. They say, "Who does that man think he's teaching? Who needs his message? It's only good for babies that have just stopped nursing! 
23Is 28:10 He is trying to teach us letter by letter, line by line, lesson by lesson." 
23Is 28:11 If you won't listen to me, then God will use foreigners speaking some strange-sounding language to teach you a lesson. 
23Is 28:12 He offered rest and comfort to all of you, but you refused to listen to him. 
23Is 28:13 That is why the LORD is going to teach you letter by letter, line by line, lesson by lesson. Then you will stumble with every step you take. You will be wounded, trapped, and taken prisoner. 
23Is 28:14 Now you arrogant leaders who rule here in Jerusalem over this people, listen to what the LORD is saying. 
23Is 28:15 You boast that you have made a treaty with death and reached an agreement with the world of the dead. You are certain that disaster will spare you when it comes, because you depend on lies and deceit to keep you safe. 
23Is 28:16 This, now, is what the Sovereign LORD says�� "I am placing in Zion a foundation that is firm and strong. In it I am putting a solid cornerstone on which are written the words, 'Faith that is firm is also patient.' 
23Is 28:17 Justice will be the measuring line for the foundation, and honesty will be its plumb line." Hailstorms will sweep away all the lies you depend on, and floods will destroy your security. 
23Is 28:18 The treaty you have made with death will be abolished, and your agreement with the world of the dead will be canceled. When disaster sweeps down, you will be overcome. 
23Is 28:19 It will strike you again and again, morning after morning. You will have to bear it day and night. Each new message from God will bring new terror! 
23Is 28:20 You will be like the person in the proverb, who tries to sleep in a bed too short to stretch out on, with a blanket too narrow to wrap himself in. 
23Is 28:21 The LORD will fight as he did at Mount Perazim and in the valley of Gibeon, in order to do what he intends to do - strange as his actions may seem. He will complete his work, his mysterious work. 
23Is 28:22 Don't laugh at the warning I am giving you! If you do, it will be even harder for you to escape. I have heard the LORD Almighty's decision to destroy the whole country. 
23Is 28:23 Listen to what I am saying; pay attention to what I am telling you. 
23Is 28:24 Farmers don't constantly plow their fields and keep getting them ready for planting. 
23Is 28:25 Once they have prepared the soil, they plant the seeds of herbs such as dill and cumin. They plant rows of wheat and barley, and at the edges of their fields they plant other grain. 
23Is 28:26 They know how to do their work, because God has taught them. 
23Is 28:27 They never use a heavy club to beat out dill seeds or cumin seeds; instead they use light sticks of the proper size. 
23Is 28:28 They do not ruin the wheat by threshing it endlessly, and they know how to thresh it by driving a cart over it without bruising the grains. 
23Is 28:29 All this wisdom comes from the LORD Almighty. The plans God makes are wise, and they always succeed. 
23Is 29:1 God's altar, Jerusalem itself, is doomed! The city where David camped is doomed! Let another year or two come and go, with its feasts and festivals, 
23Is 29:2 and then God will bring disaster on the city that is called "God's altar." There will be weeping and wailing, and the whole city will be like an altar covered with blood. 
23Is 29:3 God will attack the city, surround it, and besiege it. 
23Is 29:4 Jerusalem will be like a ghost struggling to speak from under the ground, a muffled voice coming from the dust. 
23Is 29:5 Jerusalem, all the foreigners who attack you will be blown away like dust, and their terrifying armies will fly away like straw. Suddenly and unexpectedly 
23Is 29:6 the LORD Almighty will rescue you with violent thunderstorms and earthquakes. He will send windstorms and raging fire; 
23Is 29:7 then all the armies of the nations attacking the city of God's altar, all their weapons and equipment - everything - will vanish like a dream, like something imagined in the night. 
23Is 29:8 All the nations that assemble to attack Jerusalem will be like a starving person who dreams he is eating and wakes up hungry, or like someone dying of thirst who dreams he is drinking and wakes with a dry throat. 
23Is 29:9 Go ahead and be stupid! Go ahead and be blind! Get drunk without any wine! Stagger without drinking a drop! 
23Is 29:10 The LORD has made you drowsy, ready to fall into a deep sleep. The prophets should be the eyes of the people, but God has blindfolded them. 
23Is 29:11 The meaning of every prophetic vision will be hidden from you; it will be like a sealed scroll. If you take it to someone who knows how to read and ask him to read it to you, he will say he can't because it is sealed. 
23Is 29:12 If you give it to someone who can't read and ask him to read it to you, he will answer that he doesn't know how. 
23Is 29:13 The Lord said, "These people claim to worship me, but their words are meaningless, and their hearts are somewhere else. Their religion is nothing but human rules and traditions, which they have simply memorized. 
23Is 29:14 So I will startle them with one unexpected blow after another. Those who are wise will turn out to be fools, and all their cleverness will be useless." 
23Is 29:15 Those who try to hide their plans from the LORD are doomed! They carry out their schemes in secret and think no one will see them or know what they are doing. 
23Is 29:16 They turn everything upside down. Which is more important, the potter or the clay? Can something you have made say, "You didn't make me"? Or can it say, "You don't know what you are doing"? 
23Is 29:17 As the saying goes, before long the dense forest will become farmland, and the farmland will go back to forest. 
23Is 29:18 When that day comes, the deaf will be able to hear a book being read aloud, and the blind, who have been living in darkness, will open their eyes and see. 
23Is 29:19 Poor and humble people will once again find the happiness which the LORD, the holy God of Israel, gives. 
23Is 29:20 It will be the end of those who oppress others and show contempt for God. Every sinner will be destroyed. 
23Is 29:21 God will destroy those who slander others, those who prevent the punishment of criminals, and those who tell lies to keep honest people from getting justice. 
23Is 29:22 So now the LORD, the God of Israel, who rescued Abraham from trouble, says, "My people, you will not be disgraced any longer, and your faces will no longer be pale with shame. 
23Is 29:23 When you see the children that I will give you, then you will acknowledge that I am the holy God of Israel. You will honor me and stand in awe of me. 
23Is 29:24 Foolish people will learn to understand, and those who are always grumbling will be glad to be taught." 
23Is 30:1 The LORD has spoken�� "Those who rule Judah are doomed because they rebel against me. They follow plans that I did not make, and sign treaties against my will, piling one sin on another. 
23Is 30:2 They go to Egypt for help without asking for my advice. They want Egypt to protect them, so they put their trust in Egypt's king. 
23Is 30:3 But the king will be powerless to help them, and Egypt's protection will end in disaster. 
23Is 30:4 Although their ambassadors have already arrived at the Egyptian cities of Zoan and Hanes, 
23Is 30:5 the people of Judah will regret that they ever trusted that unreliable nation, a nation that fails them when they expect help." 
23Is 30:6 This is God's message about the animals of the southern desert�� "The ambassadors travel through dangerous country, where lions live and where there are poisonous snakes and flying dragons. They load their donkeys and camels with expensive gifts for a nation that cannot give them any help. 
23Is 30:7 The help that Egypt gives is useless. So I have nicknamed Egypt, 'The Harmless Dragon.' " 
23Is 30:8 God told me to write down in a book what the people are like, so that there would be a permanent record of how evil they are. 
23Is 30:9 They are always rebelling against God, always lying, always refusing to listen to the LORD's teachings. 
23Is 30:10 They tell the prophets to keep quiet. They say, "Don't talk to us about what's right. Tell us what we want to hear. Let us keep our illusions. 
23Is 30:11 Get out of our way and stop blocking our path. We don't want to hear about your holy God of Israel." 
23Is 30:12 But this is what the holy God of Israel says�� "You ignore what I tell you and rely on violence and deceit. 
23Is 30:13 You are guilty. You are like a high wall with a crack running down it; suddenly you will collapse. 
23Is 30:14 You will be shattered like a clay pot, so badly broken that there is no piece big enough to pick up hot coals with or to dip water from a cistern." 
23Is 30:15 The Sovereign LORD, the Holy One of Israel, says to the people, "Come back and quietly trust in me. Then you will be strong and secure." But you refuse to do it. 
23Is 30:16 Instead, you plan to escape from your enemies by riding fast horses. And you are right - escape is what you will have to do! You think your horses are fast enough, but those who pursue you will be faster! 
23Is 30:17 A thousand of you will run away when you see one enemy soldier, and five soldiers will be enough to make you all run away. Nothing will be left of your army except a lonely flagpole on the top of a hill. 
23Is 30:18 And yet the LORD is waiting to be merciful to you. He is ready to take pity on you because he always does what is right. Happy are those who put their trust in the LORD. 
23Is 30:19 You people who live in Jerusalem will not weep any more. The LORD is compassionate, and when you cry to him for help, he will answer you. 
23Is 30:20 The Lord will make you go through hard times, but he himself will be there to teach you, and you will not have to search for him any more. 
23Is 30:21 If you wander off the road to the right or the left, you will hear his voice behind you saying, "Here is the road. Follow it." 
23Is 30:22 You will take your idols plated with silver and your idols covered with gold, and will throw them away like filth, shouting, "Out of my sight!" 
23Is 30:23 Whenever you plant your crops, the Lord will send rain to make them grow and will give you a rich harvest, and your livestock will have plenty of pasture. 
23Is 30:24 The oxen and donkeys that plow your fields will eat the finest and best fodder. 
23Is 30:25 On the day when the forts of your enemies are captured and their people are killed, streams of water will flow from every mountain and every hill. 
23Is 30:26 The moon will be as bright as the sun, and the sun will be seven times brighter than usual, like the light of seven days in one. This will all happen when the LORD bandages and heals the wounds he has given his people. 
23Is 30:27 The LORD's power and glory can be seen in the distance. Fire and smoke show his anger. He speaks, and his words burn like fire. 
23Is 30:28 He sends the wind in front of him like a flood that carries everything away. It sweeps nations to destruction and puts an end to their evil plans. 
23Is 30:29 But you, God's people, will be happy and sing as you do on the night of a sacred festival. You will be as happy as those who walk to the music of flutes on their way to the Temple of the LORD, the defender of Israel. 
23Is 30:30 The LORD will let everyone hear his majestic voice and feel the force of his anger. There will be flames, cloudbursts, hailstones, and torrents of rain. 
23Is 30:31 The Assyrians will be terrified when they hear the LORD's voice and feel the force of his punishment. 
23Is 30:32 As the LORD strikes them again and again, his people will keep time with the music of drums and harps. God himself will fight against the Assyrians. 
23Is 30:33 Long ago a place was prepared where a huge fire will burn the emperor of Assyria. It is deep and wide, and piled high with wood. The LORD will breathe out a stream of flame to set it on fire. 
23Is 31:1 Those who go to Egypt for help are doomed! They are relying on Egypt's vast military strength - horses, chariots, and soldiers. But they do not rely on the LORD, the holy God of Israel, or ask him for help. 
23Is 31:2 He knows what he is doing! He sends disaster. He carries out his threats to punish evil people and those who protect them. 
23Is 31:3 The Egyptians are not gods - they are only human. Their horses are not supernatural. When the LORD acts, the strong nation will crumble, and the weak nation it helped will fall. Both of them will be destroyed. 
23Is 31:4 The LORD said to me, "No matter how shepherds yell and shout, they can't scare away a lion from an animal that it has killed; in the same way, there is nothing that can keep me, the LORD Almighty, from protecting Mount Zion. 
23Is 31:5 Just as a bird hovers over its nest to protect its young, so I, the LORD Almighty, will protect Jerusalem and defend it." 
23Is 31:6 God said, "People of Israel, you have sinned against me and opposed me. But now, come back to me! 
23Is 31:7 A time is coming when all of you will throw away the sinful idols you made out of silver and gold. 
23Is 31:8 Assyria will be destroyed in war, but not by human power. The Assyrians will run from battle, and their young men will be made slaves. 
23Is 31:9 Their emperor will run away in terror, and the officers will be so frightened that they will abandon their battle flags." The LORD has spoken - the LORD who is worshiped in Jerusalem and whose fire burns there for sacrifices. 
23Is 32:1 Some day there will be a king who rules with integrity, and national leaders who govern with justice. 
23Is 32:2 Each of them will be like a shelter from the wind and a place to hide from storms. They will be like streams flowing in a desert, like the shadow of a giant rock in a barren land. 
23Is 32:3 Their eyes and ears will be open to the needs of the people. 
23Is 32:4 They will not be impatient any longer, but they will act with understanding and will say what they mean. 
23Is 32:5 No one will think that a fool is honorable or say that a scoundrel is honest. 
23Is 32:6 A fool speaks foolishly and thinks up evil things to do. What he does and what he says are an insult to the LORD, and he never feeds the hungry or gives thirsty people anything to drink. 
23Is 32:7 A stupid person is evil and does evil things; he plots to ruin the poor with lies and to keep them from getting their rights. 
23Is 32:8 But an honorable person acts honestly and stands firm for what is right. 
23Is 32:9 You women who live an easy life, free from worries, listen to what I am saying. 
23Is 32:10 You may be satisfied now, but this time next year you will be in despair because there will be no grapes for you to gather. 
23Is 32:11 You have been living an easy life, free from worries; but now, tremble with fear! Strip off your clothes and tie rags around your waist. 
23Is 32:12 Beat your breasts in grief because the fertile fields and the vineyards have been destroyed, 
23Is 32:13 and thorn bushes and briers are growing on my people's land. Weep for all the houses where people were happy and for the city that was full of life. 
23Is 32:14 Even the palace will be abandoned and the capital city totally deserted. Homes and the forts that guarded them will be in ruins forever. Wild donkeys will roam there, and sheep will find pasture there. 
23Is 32:15 But once more God will send us his spirit. The wasteland will become fertile, and fields will produce rich crops. 
23Is 32:16 Everywhere in the land righteousness and justice will be done. 
23Is 32:17 Because everyone will do what is right, there will be peace and security forever. 
23Is 32:18 God's people will be free from worries, and their homes peaceful and safe. 
23Is 32:19 (But hail will fall on the forests, and the city will be torn down.) 
23Is 32:20 How happy everyone will be with plenty of water for the crops and safe pasture everywhere for the donkeys and cattle. 
23Is 33:1 Our enemies are doomed! They have robbed and betrayed, although no one has robbed them or betrayed them. But their time to rob and betray will end, and they themselves will become victims of robbery and treachery. 
23Is 33:2 LORD, have mercy on us. We have put our hope in you. Protect us day by day and save us in times of trouble. 
23Is 33:3 When you fight for us, nations run away from the noise of battle. 
23Is 33:4 Their belongings are pounced upon and taken as loot. 
23Is 33:5 How great the LORD is! He rules over everything. He will fill Jerusalem with justice and integrity 
23Is 33:6 and give stability to the nation. He always protects his people and gives them wisdom and knowledge. Their greatest treasure is their reverence for the LORD. 
23Is 33:7 The brave are calling for help. The ambassadors who tried to bring about peace are crying bitterly. 
23Is 33:8 The highways are so dangerous that no one travels on them. Treaties are broken and agreements are violated. No one is respected any more. 
23Is 33:9 The land lies idle and deserted. The forests of Lebanon have withered, the fertile valley of Sharon is like a desert, and in Bashan and on Mount Carmel the leaves are falling from the trees. 
23Is 33:10 The LORD says to the nations, "Now I will act. I will show how powerful I am. 
23Is 33:11 You make worthless plans and everything you do is useless. My spirit is like a fire that will destroy you. 
23Is 33:12 You will crumble like rocks burned to make lime, like thorns burned to ashes. 
23Is 33:13 Let everyone near and far hear what I have done and acknowledge my power." 
23Is 33:14 The sinful people of Zion are trembling with fright. They say, "God's judgment is like a fire that burns forever. Can any of us survive a fire like that?" 
23Is 33:15 You can survive if you say and do what is right. Don't use your power to cheat the poor and don't accept bribes. Don't join with those who plan to commit murder or to do other evil things. 
23Is 33:16 Then you will be safe; you will be as secure as if in a strong fortress. You will have food to eat and water to drink. 
23Is 33:17 Once again you will see a king ruling in splendor over a land that stretches in all directions. 
23Is 33:18 Your old fears of foreign tax collectors and spies will be only a memory. 
23Is 33:19 You will no longer see any arrogant foreigners who speak a language that you can't understand. 
23Is 33:20 Look at Zion, the city where we celebrate our religious festivals. Look at Jerusalem! What a safe place it will be to live in! It will be like a tent that is never moved, whose pegs are never pulled up and whose ropes never break. 
23Is 33:21 The LORD will show us his glory. We will live beside broad rivers and streams, but hostile ships will not sail on them. 
23Is 33:22 All the rigging on those ships is useless; the sails cannot be spread! We will seize all the wealth of enemy armies, and there will be so much that even the lame can get a share. 
23Is 33:23 The LORD himself will be our king; he will rule over us and protect us. 
23Is 33:24 No one who lives in our land will ever again complain of being sick, and all sins will be forgiven. 
23Is 34:1 Come, people of all nations! Gather around and listen. Let the whole earth and everyone living on it come here and listen. 
23Is 34:2 The LORD is angry with all the nations and all their armies. He has condemned them to destruction. 
23Is 34:3 Their corpses will not be buried, but will lie there rotting and stinking; and the mountains will be red with blood. 
23Is 34:4 The sun, moon, and stars will crumble to dust. The sky will disappear like a scroll being rolled up, and the stars will fall like leaves dropping from a vine or a fig tree. 
23Is 34:5 The LORD has prepared his sword in heaven, and now it will strike Edom, those people whom he has condemned to destruction. 
23Is 34:6 His sword will be covered with their blood and fat, like the blood and fat of lambs and goats that are sacrificed. The LORD will offer this sacrifice in the city of Bozrah; he will make this a great slaughter in the land of Edom. 
23Is 34:7 The people will fall like wild oxen and young bulls, and the earth will be red with blood and covered with fat. 
23Is 34:8 This is the time when the LORD will rescue Zion and take vengeance on her enemies. 
23Is 34:9 The rivers of Edom will turn into tar, and the soil will turn into sulfur. The whole country will burn like tar. 
23Is 34:10 It will burn day and night, and smoke will rise from it forever. The land will lie waste age after age, and no one will ever travel through it again. 
23Is 34:11 Owls and ravens will take over the land. The LORD will make it a barren waste again, as it was before the creation. 
23Is 34:12 There will be no king to rule the country, and the leaders will all be gone. 
23Is 34:13 Thorns and thistles will grow up in all the palaces and walled towns, and jackals and owls will live in them. 
23Is 34:14 Wild animals will roam there, and demons will call to each other. The night monster will come there looking for a place to rest. 
23Is 34:15 Owls will build their nests, lay eggs, hatch their young, and care for them there. Vultures will gather there, one after another. 
23Is 34:16 Search in the LORD's book of living creatures and read what it says. Not one of these creatures will be missing, and not one will be without its mate. The LORD has commanded it to be so; he himself will bring them together. 
23Is 34:17 It is the LORD who will divide the land among them and give each of them a share. They will live in the land age after age, and it will belong to them forever. 
23Is 35:1 The desert will rejoice, and flowers will bloom in the wastelands. 
23Is 35:2 The desert will sing and shout for joy; it will be as beautiful as the Lebanon Mountains and as fertile as the fields of Carmel and Sharon. Everyone will see the LORD's splendor, see his greatness and power. 
23Is 35:3 Give strength to hands that are tired and to knees that tremble with weakness. 
23Is 35:4 Tell everyone who is discouraged, "Be strong and don't be afraid! God is coming to your rescue, coming to punish your enemies." 
23Is 35:5 The blind will be able to see, and the deaf will hear. 
23Is 35:6 The lame will leap and dance, and those who cannot speak will shout for joy. Streams of water will flow through the desert; 
23Is 35:7 the burning sand will become a lake, and dry land will be filled with springs. Where jackals used to live, marsh grass and reeds will grow. 
23Is 35:8 There will be a highway there, called "The Road of Holiness." No sinner will ever travel that road; no fools will mislead those who follow it. 
23Is 35:9 No lions will be there; no fierce animals will pass that way. Those whom the LORD has rescued will travel home by that road. 
23Is 35:10 They will reach Jerusalem with gladness, singing and shouting for joy. They will be happy forever, forever free from sorrow and grief. 
23Is 36:1 In the fourteenth year that Hezekiah was king of Judah, Sennacherib, the emperor of Assyria, attacked the fortified cities of Judah and captured them. 
23Is 36:2 Then he ordered his chief official to go from Lachish to Jerusalem with a large military force to demand that King Hezekiah surrender. The official occupied the road where the cloth makers work, by the ditch that brings water from the upper pool. 
23Is 36:3 Three Judeans came out to meet him�� the official in charge of the palace, Eliakim son of Hilkiah; the court secretary, Shebna; and the official in charge of the records, Joah son of Asaph. 
23Is 36:4 The Assyrian official told them that the emperor wanted to know what made King Hezekiah so confident. 
23Is 36:5 He demanded, "Do you think that words can take the place of military skill and might? Who do you think will help you rebel against Assyria? 
23Is 36:6 You are expecting Egypt to help you, but that would be like using a reed as a walking stick - it would break and would jab your hand. That is what the king of Egypt is like when anyone relies on him." 
23Is 36:7 The Assyrian official went on, "Or will you tell me that you are relying on the LORD your God? It was the LORD's shrines and altars that Hezekiah destroyed when he told the people of Judah and Jerusalem to worship at one altar only. 
23Is 36:8 I will make a bargain with you in the name of the emperor. I will give you two thousand horses if you can find that many riders. 
23Is 36:9 You are no match for even the lowest ranking Assyrian official, and yet you expect the Egyptians to send you chariots and horsemen. 
23Is 36:10 Do you think I have attacked your country and destroyed it without the LORD's help? The LORD himself told me to attack it and destroy it." 
23Is 36:11 Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah told the official, "Speak Aramaic to us. We understand it. Don't speak Hebrew; all the people on the wall are listening." 
23Is 36:12 He replied, "Do you think you and the king are the only ones the emperor sent me to say all these things to? No, I am also talking to the people who are sitting on the wall, who will have to eat their excrement and drink their urine, just as you will." 
23Is 36:13 Then the official stood up and shouted in Hebrew, "Listen to what the emperor of Assyria is telling you. 
23Is 36:14 He warns you not to let Hezekiah deceive you. Hezekiah can't save you. 
23Is 36:15 And don't let him persuade you to rely on the LORD. Don't think that the LORD will save you and that he will stop our Assyrian army from capturing your city. 
23Is 36:16 Don't listen to Hezekiah! The emperor of Assyria commands you to come out of the city and surrender. You will all be allowed to eat grapes from your own vines and figs from your own trees, and to drink water from your own wells - 
23Is 36:17 until the emperor resettles you in a country much like your own, where there are vineyards to give wine and there is grain for making bread. 
23Is 36:18 Don't let Hezekiah fool you into thinking that the LORD will rescue you. Did the gods of any other nations save their countries from the emperor of Assyria? 
23Is 36:19 Where are they now, the gods of Hamath and Arpad? Where are the gods of Sepharvaim? Did anyone save Samaria? 
23Is 36:20 When did any of the gods of all these countries ever save their country from our emperor? Then what makes you think the LORD can save Jerusalem?" 
23Is 36:21 The people kept quiet, just as King Hezekiah had told them to; they did not say a word. 
23Is 36:22 Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah tore their clothes in grief and went and reported to the king what the Assyrian official had said. 
23Is 37:1 As soon as King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes in grief, put on sackcloth, and went to the Temple of the LORD. 
23Is 37:2 He sent Eliakim, the official in charge of the palace, Shebna, the court secretary, and the senior priests to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. They also were wearing sackcloth. 
23Is 37:3 This is the message which he told them to give to Isaiah�� "Today is a day of suffering; we are being punished and are in disgrace. We are like a woman who is ready to give birth, but is too weak to do it. 
23Is 37:4 The Assyrian emperor has sent his chief official to insult the living God. May the LORD your God hear these insults and punish those who spoke them. So pray to God for those of our people who survive." 
23Is 37:5 When Isaiah received King Hezekiah's message, 
23Is 37:6 he sent back this answer�� "The LORD tells you not to let the Assyrians frighten you by their claims that he cannot save you. 
23Is 37:7 The LORD will cause the emperor to hear a rumor that will make him go back to his own country, and the LORD will have him killed there." 
23Is 37:8 The Assyrian official learned that the emperor had left Lachish and was fighting against the nearby city of Libnah; so he went there to consult him. 
23Is 37:9 Word reached the Assyrians that the Egyptian army, led by King Tirhakah of Ethiopia, was coming to attack them. When the emperor heard this, he sent a letter to King Hezekiah 
23Is 37:10 of Judah to tell him�� "The god you are trusting in has told you that you will not fall into my hands, but don't let that deceive you. 
23Is 37:11 You have heard what an Assyrian emperor does to any country he decides to destroy. Do you think that you can escape? 
23Is 37:12 My ancestors destroyed the cities of Gozan, Haran, and Rezeph, and killed the people of Betheden who lived in Telassar, and none of their gods could save them. 
23Is 37:13 Where are the kings of the cities of Hamath, Arpad, Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?" 
23Is 37:14 King Hezekiah took the letter from the messengers and read it. Then he went to the Temple, placed the letter there in the presence of the LORD, 
23Is 37:15 and prayed, 
23Is 37:16 "Almighty LORD, God of Israel, seated above the winged creatures, you alone are God, ruling all the kingdoms of the world. You created the earth and the sky. 
23Is 37:17 Now, LORD, hear us and look at what is happening to us. Listen to all the things that Sennacherib is saying to insult you, the living God. 
23Is 37:18 We all know, LORD, that the emperors of Assyria have destroyed many nations, made their lands desolate, 
23Is 37:19 and burned up their gods - which were no gods at all, only images of wood and stone made by human hands. 
23Is 37:20 Now, LORD our God, rescue us from the Assyrians, so that all the nations of the world will know that you alone are God." 
23Is 37:21 Then Isaiah sent a message telling King Hezekiah that in answer to the king's prayer 
23Is 37:22 the LORD had said, "The city of Jerusalem laughs at you, Sennacherib, and makes fun of you. 
23Is 37:23 Whom do you think you have been insulting and ridiculing? You have been disrespectful to me, the holy God of Israel. 
23Is 37:24 You sent your servants to boast to me that with all your chariots you had conquered the highest mountains of Lebanon. You boasted that there you cut down the tallest cedars and the finest cypress trees, and that you reached the deepest parts of the forests. 
23Is 37:25 You boasted that you dug wells and drank water in foreign lands, and that the feet of your soldiers tramped the Nile River dry. 
23Is 37:26 "Have you never heard that I planned all this long ago? And now I have carried it out. I gave you the power to turn fortified cities into piles of rubble. 
23Is 37:27 The people who lived there were powerless; they were frightened and stunned. They were like grass in a field or weeds growing on a roof when the hot east wind blasts them. 
23Is 37:28 "But I know everything about you, what you do and where you go. I know how you rage against me. 
23Is 37:29 I have received the report of that rage and that pride of yours, and now I will put a hook through your nose and a bit in your mouth and will take you back by the same road you came." 
23Is 37:30 Then Isaiah said to King Hezekiah, "Here is a sign of what will happen. This year and next you will have only wild grain to eat, but the following year you will be able to plant grain and harvest it, and plant vines and eat grapes. 
23Is 37:31 Those in Judah who survive will flourish like plants that send roots deep into the ground and produce fruit. 
23Is 37:32 There will be people in Jerusalem and on Mount Zion who will survive, because the LORD Almighty is determined to make this happen. 
23Is 37:33 "And this is what the LORD has said about the Assyrian emperor�� 'He will not enter this city or shoot a single arrow against it. No soldiers with shields will come near the city, and no siege mounds will be built around it. 
23Is 37:34 He will go back by the same road he came, without entering this city. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
23Is 37:35 I will defend this city and protect it, for the sake of my own honor and because of the promise I made to my servant David.' " 
23Is 37:36 An angel of the LORD went to the Assyrian camp and killed 185,000 soldiers. At dawn the next day there they lay, all dead! 
23Is 37:37 Then the Assyrian emperor Sennacherib withdrew and returned to Nineveh. 
23Is 37:38 One day when he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, two of his sons, Adrammelech and Sharezer, killed him with their swords and then escaped to the land of Ararat. Another of his sons, Esarhaddon, succeeded him as emperor. 
23Is 38:1 About this time King Hezekiah became sick and almost died. The prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to see him and said to him, "The LORD tells you that you are to put everything in order because you will not recover. Get ready to die." 
23Is 38:2 Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed�� 
23Is 38:3 "Remember, LORD, that I have served you faithfully and loyally, and that I have always tried to do what you wanted me to." And he began to cry bitterly. 
23Is 38:4 Then the LORD commanded Isaiah 
23Is 38:5 to go back to Hezekiah and say to him, "I, the LORD, the God of your ancestor David, have heard your prayer and seen your tears; I will let you live fifteen years longer. 
23Is 38:6 I will rescue you and this city of Jerusalem from the emperor of Assyria, and I will continue to protect the city." 
23Is 38:7 Isaiah replied, "The LORD will give you a sign to prove that he will keep his promise. 
23Is 38:8 On the stairway built by King Ahaz, the LORD will make the shadow go back ten steps." And the shadow moved back ten steps. 
23Is 38:9 After Hezekiah recovered from his illness, he wrote this song of praise�� 
23Is 38:10 I thought that in the prime of life I was going to the world of the dead, Never to live out my life. 
23Is 38:11 I thought that in this world of the living I would never again see the LORD Or any living person. 
23Is 38:12 My life was cut off and ended, Like a tent that is taken down, Like cloth that is cut from a loom. I thought that God was ending my life. 
23Is 38:13 All night I cried out with pain, As if a lion were breaking my bones. I thought that God was ending my life. 
23Is 38:14 My voice was thin and weak, And I moaned like a dove. My eyes grew tired from looking to heaven. LORD, rescue me from all this trouble. 
23Is 38:15 What can I say? The LORD has done this. My heart is bitter, and I cannot sleep. 
23Is 38:16 Lord, I will live for you, for you alone; Heal me and let me live. 
23Is 38:17 My bitterness will turn into peace. You save my life from all danger; You forgive all my sins. 
23Is 38:18 No one in the world of the dead can praise you; The dead cannot trust in your faithfulness. 
23Is 38:19 It is the living who praise you, As I praise you now. Parents tell their children how faithful you are. 
23Is 38:20 LORD, you have healed me. We will play harps and sing your praise, Sing praise in your Temple as long as we live. 
23Is 38:21 Isaiah told the king to put a paste made of figs on his boil, and he would get well. 
23Is 38:22 Then King Hezekiah asked, "What is the sign to prove that I will be able to go to the Temple?" 
23Is 39:1 About that same time the king of Babylonia, Merodach Baladan, son of Baladan, heard that King Hezekiah had been sick, so he sent him a letter and a present. 
23Is 39:2 Hezekiah welcomed the messengers and showed them his wealth - his silver and gold, his spices and perfumes, and all his military equipment. There was nothing in his storerooms or anywhere in his kingdom that he did not show them. 
23Is 39:3 Then the prophet Isaiah went to King Hezekiah and asked, "Where did these messengers come from and what did they say to you?" Hezekiah answered, "They came from a very distant country, from Babylonia." 
23Is 39:4 "What did they see in the palace?" "They saw everything. There is nothing in the storerooms that I didn't show them." 
23Is 39:5 Isaiah then told the king, "The LORD Almighty says that 
23Is 39:6 a time is coming when everything in your palace, everything that your ancestors have stored up to this day, will be carried off to Babylonia. Nothing will be left. 
23Is 39:7 Some of your own direct descendants will be taken away and made eunuchs to serve in the palace of the king of Babylonia." 
23Is 39:8 King Hezekiah understood this to mean that there would be peace and security during his lifetime, so he replied, "The message you have given me from the LORD is good." 
23Is 40:1 "Comfort my people," says our God. "Comfort them! 
23Is 40:2 Encourage the people of Jerusalem. Tell them they have suffered long enough and their sins are now forgiven. I have punished them in full for all their sins." 
23Is 40:3 A voice cries out, "Prepare in the wilderness a road for the LORD! Clear the way in the desert for our God! 
23Is 40:4 Fill every valley; level every mountain. The hills will become a plain, and the rough country will be made smooth. 
23Is 40:5 Then the glory of the LORD will be revealed, and all people will see it. The LORD himself has promised this." 
23Is 40:6 A voice cries out, "Proclaim a message!" "What message shall I proclaim?" I ask. "Proclaim that all human beings are like grass; they last no longer than wild flowers. 
23Is 40:7 Grass withers and flowers fade when the LORD sends the wind blowing over them. People are no more enduring than grass. 
23Is 40:8 Yes, grass withers and flowers fade, but the word of our God endures forever." 
23Is 40:9 Jerusalem, go up on a high mountain and proclaim the good news! Call out with a loud voice, Zion; announce the good news! Speak out and do not be afraid. Tell the towns of Judah that their God is coming! 
23Is 40:10 The Sovereign LORD is coming to rule with power, bringing with him the people he has rescued. 
23Is 40:11 He will take care of his flock like a shepherd; he will gather the lambs together and carry them in his arms; he will gently lead their mothers. 
23Is 40:12 Can anyone measure the ocean by handfuls or measure the sky with his hands? Can anyone hold the soil of the earth in a cup or weigh the mountains and hills on scales? 
23Is 40:13 Can anyone tell the LORD what to do? Who can teach him or give him advice? 
23Is 40:14 With whom does God consult in order to know and understand and to learn how things should be done? 
23Is 40:15 To the LORD the nations are nothing, no more than a drop of water; the distant islands are as light as dust. 
23Is 40:16 All the animals in the forests of Lebanon are not enough for a sacrifice to our God, and its trees are too few to kindle the fire. 
23Is 40:17 The nations are nothing at all to him. 
23Is 40:18 To whom can God be compared? How can you describe what he is like? 
23Is 40:19 He is not like an idol that workers make, that metalworkers cover with gold and set in a base of silver. 
23Is 40:20 Anyone who cannot afford silver or gold chooses wood that will not rot. He finds a skillful worker to make an image that won't fall down. 
23Is 40:21 Do you not know? Were you not told long ago? Have you not heard how the world began? 
23Is 40:22 It was made by the one who sits on his throne above the earth and beyond the sky; the people below look as tiny as ants. He stretched out the sky like a curtain, like a tent in which to live. 
23Is 40:23 He brings down powerful rulers and reduces them to nothing. 
23Is 40:24 They are like young plants, just set out and barely rooted. When the LORD sends a wind, they dry up and blow away like straw. 
23Is 40:25 To whom can the holy God be compared? Is there anyone else like him? 
23Is 40:26 Look up at the sky! Who created the stars you see? The one who leads them out like an army, he knows how many there are and calls each one by name! His power is so great - not one of them is ever missing! 
23Is 40:27 Israel, why then do you complain that the LORD doesn't know your troubles or care if you suffer injustice? 
23Is 40:28 Don't you know? Haven't you heard? The LORD is the everlasting God; he created all the world. He never grows tired or weary. No one understands his thoughts. 
23Is 40:29 He strengthens those who are weak and tired. 
23Is 40:30 Even those who are young grow weak; young people can fall exhausted. 
23Is 40:31 But those who trust in the LORD for help will find their strength renewed. They will rise on wings like eagles; they will run and not get weary; they will walk and not grow weak. 
23Is 41:1 God says, "Be silent and listen to me, you distant lands! Get ready to present your case in court; you will have your chance to speak. Let us come together to decide who is right. 
23Is 41:2 "Who was it that brought the conqueror from the east and makes him triumphant wherever he goes? Who gives him victory over kings and nations? His sword strikes them down as if they were dust. His arrows scatter them like straw before the wind. 
23Is 41:3 He follows in pursuit and marches safely on, so fast that he hardly touches the ground! 
23Is 41:4 Who was it that made this happen? Who has determined the course of history? I, the LORD, was there at the beginning, and I, the LORD, will be there at the end. 
23Is 41:5 "The people of distant lands have seen what I have done; they are frightened and tremble with fear. So they all assemble and come. 
23Is 41:6 The skilled workers help and encourage each other. 
23Is 41:7 The carpenter says to the goldsmith, 'Well done!' The one who beats the idol smooth encourages the one who nails it together. They say, 'The soldering is good' - and they fasten the idol in place with nails. 
23Is 41:8 "But you, Israel my servant, you are the people that I have chosen, the descendants of Abraham, my friend. 
23Is 41:9 I brought you from the ends of the earth; I called you from its farthest corners and said to you, 'You are my servant.' I did not reject you, but chose you. 
23Is 41:10 Do not be afraid - I am with you! I am your God - let nothing terrify you! I will make you strong and help you; I will protect you and save you. 
23Is 41:11 "Those who are angry with you will know the shame of defeat. Those who fight against you will die 
23Is 41:12 and will disappear from the earth. 
23Is 41:13 I am the LORD your God; I strengthen you and tell you, 'Do not be afraid; I will help you.' " 
23Is 41:14 The LORD says, "Small and weak as you are, Israel, don't be afraid; I will help you. I, the holy God of Israel, am the one who saves you. 
23Is 41:15 I will make you like a threshing board, with spikes that are new and sharp. You will thresh mountains and destroy them; hills will crumble into dust. 
23Is 41:16 You will toss them in the air; the wind will carry them off, and they will be scattered by the storm. Then you will be happy because I am your God; you will praise me, the holy God of Israel. 
23Is 41:17 "When my people in their need look for water, when their throats are dry with thirst, then I, the LORD, will answer their prayer; I, the God of Israel, will never abandon them. 
23Is 41:18 I will make rivers flow among barren hills and springs of water run in the valleys. I will turn the desert into pools of water and the dry land into flowing springs. 
23Is 41:19 I will make cedars grow in the desert, and acacias and myrtles and olive trees. Forests will grow in barren land, forests of pine and juniper and cypress. 
23Is 41:20 People will see this and know that I, the LORD, have done it. They will come to understand that Israel's holy God has made it happen." 
23Is 41:21 The LORD, the king of Israel, has this to say�� "You gods of the nations, present your case. Bring the best arguments you have! 
23Is 41:22 Come here and predict what will happen, so that we will know it when it takes place. Explain to the court the events of the past, and tell us what they mean. 
23Is 41:23 Tell us what the future holds - then we will know that you are gods! Do something good or bring some disaster; fill us with fear and awe! 
23Is 41:24 You and all you do are nothing; those who worship you are disgusting! 
23Is 41:25 "I have chosen a man who lives in the east; I will bring him to attack from the north. He tramples on rulers as if they were mud, like a potter trampling clay. 
23Is 41:26 Which of you predicted that this would happen, so that we could say that you were right? None of you said a word about it; no one heard you say a thing! 
23Is 41:27 I, the LORD, was the first to tell Zion the news; I sent a messenger to Jerusalem to say, 'Your people are coming! They are coming home!' 
23Is 41:28 When I looked among the gods, none of them had a thing to say; not one could answer the questions I asked. 
23Is 41:29 All these gods are useless; they can do nothing at all - these idols are weak and powerless." 
23Is 42:1 The LORD says, "Here is my servant, whom I strengthen - the one I have chosen, with whom I am pleased. I have filled him with my Spirit, and he will bring justice to every nation. 
23Is 42:2 He will not shout or raise his voice or make loud speeches in the streets. 
23Is 42:3 He will not break off a bent reed nor put out a flickering lamp. He will bring lasting justice to all. 
23Is 42:4 He will not lose hope or courage; he will establish justice on the earth. Distant lands eagerly wait for his teaching." 
23Is 42:5 God created the heavens and stretched them out; he fashioned the earth and all that lives there; he gave life and breath to all its people. And now the LORD God says to his servant, 
23Is 42:6 "I, the LORD, have called you and given you power to see that justice is done on earth. Through you I will make a covenant with all peoples; through you I will bring light to the nations. 
23Is 42:7 You will open the eyes of the blind and set free those who sit in dark prisons. 
23Is 42:8 "I alone am the LORD your God. No other god may share my glory; I will not let idols share my praise. 
23Is 42:9 The things I predicted have now come true. Now I will tell you of new things even before they begin to happen." 
23Is 42:10 Sing a new song to the LORD; sing his praise, all the world! Praise him, you that sail the sea; praise him, all creatures of the sea! Sing, distant lands and all who live there! 
23Is 42:11 Let the desert and its towns praise God; let the people of Kedar praise him! Let those who live in the city of Sela shout for joy from the tops of the mountains! 
23Is 42:12 Let those who live in distant lands give praise and glory to the LORD! 
23Is 42:13 The LORD goes out to fight like a warrior; he is ready and eager for battle. He gives a war cry, a battle shout; he shows his power against his enemies. 
23Is 42:14 God says, "For a long time I kept silent; I did not answer my people. But now the time to act has come; I cry out like a woman in labor. 
23Is 42:15 I will destroy the hills and mountains and dry up the grass and trees. I will turn the river valleys into deserts and dry up the pools of water. 
23Is 42:16 "I will lead my blind people by roads they have never traveled. I will turn their darkness into light and make rough country smooth before them. These are my promises, and I will keep them without fail. 
23Is 42:17 All who trust in idols, who call images their gods, will be humiliated and disgraced." 
23Is 42:18 The LORD says, "Listen, you deaf people! Look closely, you that are blind! 
23Is 42:19 Is anyone more blind than my servant, more deaf than the messenger I send? 
23Is 42:20 Israel, you have seen so much, but what has it meant to you? You have ears to hear with, but what have you really heard?" 
23Is 42:21 The LORD is a God who is eager to save, so he exalted his laws and teachings, and he wanted his people to honor them. 
23Is 42:22 But now his people have been plundered; they are locked up in dungeons and hidden away in prisons. They were robbed and plundered, with no one to come to their rescue. 
23Is 42:23 Will any of you listen to this? From now on will you listen with care? 
23Is 42:24 Who gave Israel up to the looters? It was the LORD himself, against whom we sinned! We would not live as he wanted us to live or obey the teachings he gave us. 
23Is 42:25 So he made us feel the force of his anger and suffer the violence of war. Like fire his anger burned throughout Israel, but we never knew what was happening; we learned nothing at all from it. 
23Is 43:1 Israel, the LORD who created you says, "Do not be afraid - I will save you. I have called you by name - you are mine. 
23Is 43:2 When you pass through deep waters, I will be with you; your troubles will not overwhelm you. When you pass through fire, you will not be burned; the hard trials that come will not hurt you. 
23Is 43:3 For I am the LORD your God, the holy God of Israel, who saves you. I will give up Egypt to set you free; I will give up Ethiopia and Seba. 
23Is 43:4 I will give up whole nations to save your life, because you are precious to me and because I love you and give you honor. 
23Is 43:5 Do not be afraid - I am with you! "From the distant east and the farthest west I will bring your people home. 
23Is 43:6 I will tell the north to let them go and the south not to hold them back. Let my people return from distant lands, from every part of the world. 
23Is 43:7 They are my own people, and I created them to bring me glory." 
23Is 43:8 God says, "Summon my people to court. They have eyes, but they are blind; they have ears, but they are deaf ! 
23Is 43:9 Summon the nations to come to the trial. Which of their gods can predict the future? Which of them foretold what is happening now? Let these gods bring in their witnesses to prove that they are right, to testify to the truth of their words. 
23Is 43:10 "People of Israel, you are my witnesses; I chose you to be my servant, so that you would know me and believe in me and understand that I am the only God. Besides me there is no other god; there never was and never will be. 
23Is 43:11 "I alone am the LORD, the only one who can save you. 
23Is 43:12 I predicted what would happen, and then I came to your aid. No foreign god has ever done this; you are my witnesses. 
23Is 43:13 I am God and always will be. No one can escape from my power; no one can change what I do." 
23Is 43:14 Israel's holy God, the LORD who saves you, says, "To save you, I will send an army against Babylon; I will break down the city gates, and the shouts of her people will turn into crying. 
23Is 43:15 I am the LORD, your holy God. I created you, Israel, and I am your king." 
23Is 43:16 Long ago the LORD made a road through the sea, a path through the swirling waters. 
23Is 43:17 He led a mighty army to destruction, an army of chariots and horses. Down they fell, never to rise, snuffed out like the flame of a lamp! 
23Is 43:18 But the LORD says, "Do not cling to events of the past or dwell on what happened long ago. 
23Is 43:19 Watch for the new thing I am going to do. It is happening already - you can see it now! I will make a road through the wilderness and give you streams of water there. 
23Is 43:20 Even the wild animals will honor me; jackals and ostriches will praise me when I make rivers flow in the desert to give water to my chosen people. 
23Is 43:21 They are the people I made for myself, and they will sing my praises!" 
23Is 43:22 The LORD says, "But you were tired of me, Israel; you did not worship me. 
23Is 43:23 You did not bring me your burnt offerings of sheep; you did not honor me with your sacrifices. I did not burden you by demanding offerings or wear you out by asking for incense. 
23Is 43:24 You didn't buy incense for me or satisfy me with the fat of your animals. Instead you burdened me with your sins; you wore me out with the wrongs you have committed. 
23Is 43:25 And yet, I am the God who forgives your sins, and I do this because of who I am. I will not hold your sins against you. 
23Is 43:26 "Let us go to court; bring your accusation! Present your case to prove you are in the right! 
23Is 43:27 Your earliest ancestor sinned; your leaders sinned against me, 
23Is 43:28 and your rulers profaned my sanctuary. So I brought destruction on Israel; I let my own people be insulted." 
23Is 44:1 The LORD says, "Listen now, Israel, my servant, my chosen people, the descendants of Jacob. 
23Is 44:2 I am the LORD who created you; from the time you were born, I have helped you. Do not be afraid; you are my servant, my chosen people whom I love. 
23Is 44:3 "I will give water to the thirsty land and make streams flow on the dry ground. I will pour out my spirit on your children and my blessing on your descendants. 
23Is 44:4 They will thrive like well-watered grass, like willows by streams of running water. 
23Is 44:5 "One by one, people will say, 'I am the LORD's.' They will come to join the people of Israel. They each will mark the name of the LORD on their arms and call themselves one of God's people." 
23Is 44:6 The LORD, who rules and protects Israel, the LORD Almighty, has this to say�� "I am the first, the last, the only God; there is no other god but me. 
23Is 44:7 Could anyone else have done what I did? Who could have predicted all that would happen from the very beginning to the end of time? 
23Is 44:8 Do not be afraid, my people! You know that from ancient times until now I have predicted all that would happen, and you are my witnesses. Is there any other god? Is there some powerful god I never heard of ?" 
23Is 44:9 All those who make idols are worthless, and the gods they prize so highly are useless. Those who worship these gods are blind and ignorant - and they will be disgraced. 
23Is 44:10 It does no good to make a metal image to worship as a god! 
23Is 44:11 Everyone who worships it will be humiliated. The people who make idols are human beings and nothing more. Let them come and stand trial - they will be terrified and will suffer disgrace. 
23Is 44:12 The metalworker takes a piece of metal and works with it over a fire. His strong arm swings a hammer to pound the metal into shape. As he works, he gets hungry, thirsty, and tired. 
23Is 44:13 The carpenter measures the wood. He outlines a figure with chalk, carves it out with his tools, and makes it in the form of a man, a handsome human figure, to be placed in his house. 
23Is 44:14 He might cut down cedars to use, or choose oak or cypress wood from the forest. Or he might plant a laurel tree and wait for the rain to make it grow. 
23Is 44:15 A person uses part of a tree for fuel and part of it for making an idol. With one part he builds a fire to warm himself and bake bread; with the other part he makes a god and worships it. 
23Is 44:16 With some of the wood he makes a fire; he roasts meat, eats it, and is satisfied. He warms himself and says, "How nice and warm! What a beautiful fire!" 
23Is 44:17 The rest of the wood he makes into an idol, and then he bows down and worships it. He prays to it and says, "You are my god - save me!" 
23Is 44:18 Such people are too stupid to know what they are doing. They close their eyes and their minds to the truth. 
23Is 44:19 The maker of idols hasn't the wit or the sense to say, "Some of the wood I burned up. I baked some bread on the coals, and I roasted meat and ate it. And the rest of the wood I made into an idol. Here I am bowing down to a block of wood!" 
23Is 44:20 It makes as much sense as eating ashes. His foolish ideas have so misled him that he is beyond help. He won't admit to himself that the idol he holds in his hand is not a god at all. 
23Is 44:21 The LORD says, "Israel, remember this; remember that you are my servant. I created you to be my servant, and I will never forget you. 
23Is 44:22 I have swept your sins away like a cloud. Come back to me; I am the one who saves you." 
23Is 44:23 Shout for joy, you heavens! Shout, deep places of the earth! Shout for joy, mountains, and every tree of the forest! The LORD has shown his greatness by saving his people Israel. 
23Is 44:24 "I am the LORD, your savior; I am the one who created you. I am the LORD, the Creator of all things. I alone stretched out the heavens; when I made the earth, no one helped me. 
23Is 44:25 I make fools of fortunetellers and frustrate the predictions of astrologers. The words of the wise I refute and show that their wisdom is foolishness. 
23Is 44:26 But when my servant makes a prediction, when I send a messenger to reveal my plans, I make those plans and predictions come true. I tell Jerusalem that people will live there again, and the cities of Judah that they will be rebuilt. Those cities will rise from the ruins. 
23Is 44:27 With a word of command I dry up the ocean. 
23Is 44:28 I say to Cyrus, 'You are the one who will rule for me; you will do what I want you to do�� you will order that Jerusalem be rebuilt and that the foundations of the Temple be laid.' " 
23Is 45:1 The LORD has chosen Cyrus to be king. He has appointed him to conquer nations; he sends him to strip kings of their power; the LORD will open the gates of cities for him. To Cyrus the LORD says, 
23Is 45:2 "I myself will prepare your way, leveling mountains and hills. I will break down bronze gates and smash their iron bars. 
23Is 45:3 I will give you treasures from dark, secret places; then you will know that I am the LORD and that the God of Israel has called you by name. 
23Is 45:4 I appoint you to help my servant Israel, the people that I have chosen. I have given you great honor, although you do not know me. 
23Is 45:5 "I am the LORD; there is no other god. I will give you the strength you need, although you do not know me. 
23Is 45:6 I do this so that everyone from one end of the world to the other may know that I am the LORD and that there is no other god. 
23Is 45:7 I create both light and darkness; I bring both blessing and disaster. I, the LORD, do all these things. 
23Is 45:8 I will send victory from the sky like rain; the earth will open to receive it and will blossom with freedom and justice. I, the LORD, will make this happen." 
23Is 45:9 Does a clay pot dare argue with its maker, a pot that is like all the others? Does the clay ask the potter what he is doing? Does the pot complain that its maker has no skill? 
23Is 45:10 Do we dare say to our parents, "Why did you make me like this?" 
23Is 45:11 The LORD, the holy God of Israel, the one who shapes the future, says�� "You have no right to question me about my children or to tell me what I ought to do! 
23Is 45:12 I am the one who made the earth and created human beings to live there. By my power I stretched out the heavens; I control the sun, the moon, and the stars. 
23Is 45:13 I myself have stirred Cyrus to action to fulfill my purpose and put things right. I will straighten out every road that he travels. He will rebuild my city, Jerusalem, and set my captive people free. No one has hired him or bribed him to do this." The LORD Almighty has spoken. 
23Is 45:14 The LORD says to Israel, "The wealth of Egypt and Ethiopia will be yours, and the tall men of Seba will be your slaves; they will follow you in chains. They will bow down to you and confess, 'God is with you - he alone is God. 
23Is 45:15 The God of Israel, who saves his people, is a God who conceals himself. 
23Is 45:16 Those who make idols will all be ashamed; all of them will be disgraced. 
23Is 45:17 But Israel is saved by the LORD, and her victory lasts forever; her people will never be disgraced.' " 
23Is 45:18 The LORD created the heavens - he is the one who is God! He formed and made the earth - he made it firm and lasting. He did not make it a desolate waste, but a place for people to live. It is he who says, "I am the LORD, and there is no other god. 
23Is 45:19 I have not spoken in secret or kept my purpose hidden. I did not require the people of Israel to look for me in a desolate waste. I am the LORD, and I speak the truth; I make known what is right." 
23Is 45:20 The LORD says, "Come together, people of the nations, all who survive the fall of the empire; present yourselves for the trial! The people who parade with their idols of wood and pray to gods that cannot save them - those people know nothing at all! 
23Is 45:21 Come and present your case in court; let the defendants consult one another. Who predicted long ago what would happen? Was it not I, the LORD, the God who saves his people? There is no other god. 
23Is 45:22 "Turn to me now and be saved, people all over the world! I am the only God there is. 
23Is 45:23 My promise is true, and it will not be changed. I solemnly promise by all that I am�� Everyone will come and kneel before me and vow to be loyal to me. 
23Is 45:24 "They will say that only through me are victory and strength to be found; but all who hate me will suffer disgrace. 
23Is 45:25 I, the LORD, will rescue all the descendants of Jacob, and they will give me praise. 
23Is 46:1 "This is the end for Babylon's gods! Bel and Nebo once were worshiped, but now they are loaded on donkeys, a burden for the backs of tired animals. 
23Is 46:2 The idols cannot save themselves; they are captured and carried away. This is the end for Babylon's gods! 
23Is 46:3 "Listen to me, descendants of Jacob, all who are left of my people. I have cared for you from the time you were born. 
23Is 46:4 I am your God and will take care of you until you are old and your hair is gray. I made you and will care for you; I will give you help and rescue you. 
23Is 46:5 "To whom will you compare me?" says the LORD. "Is there anyone else like me? 
23Is 46:6 People open their purses and pour out gold; they weigh out silver on the scales. They hire a goldsmith to make a god; then they bow down and worship it. 
23Is 46:7 They lift it to their shoulders and carry it; they put it in place, and there it stands, unable to move from where it is. If any pray to it, it cannot answer or save them from disaster. 
23Is 46:8 "Remember this, you sinners; consider what I have done. 
23Is 46:9 Remember what happened long ago; acknowledge that I alone am God and that there is no one else like me. 
23Is 46:10 From the beginning I predicted the outcome; long ago I foretold what would happen. I said that my plans would never fail, that I would do everything I intended to do. 
23Is 46:11 I am calling a man to come from the east; he will swoop down like a hawk and accomplish what I have planned. I have spoken, and it will be done. 
23Is 46:12 "Listen to me, you stubborn people who think that victory is far away. 
23Is 46:13 I am bringing the day of victory near - it is not far away at all. My triumph will not be delayed. I will save Jerusalem and bring honor to Israel there." 
23Is 47:1 The LORD says, "Babylon, come down from your throne, and sit in the dust on the ground. You were once like a virgin, a city unconquered, but you are soft and delicate no longer! You are now a slave! 
23Is 47:2 Turn the millstone! Grind the flour! Off with your veil! Strip off your fine clothes! Lift up your skirts to cross the streams! 
23Is 47:3 People will see you naked; they will see you humbled and shamed. I will take vengeance, and no one will stop me." 
23Is 47:4 The holy God of Israel sets us free - his name is the LORD Almighty. 
23Is 47:5 The LORD says to Babylon, "Sit in silence and darkness; no more will they call you the queen of nations! 
23Is 47:6 I was angry with my people; I treated them as no longer mine�� I put them in your power, and you showed them no mercy; even the aged you treated harshly. 
23Is 47:7 You thought you would always be a queen, and did not take these things to heart or think how it all would end. 
23Is 47:8 "Listen to this, you lover of pleasure, you that think you are safe and secure. You claim you are as great as God - that there is no one else like you. You thought that you would never be a widow or suffer the loss of your children. 
23Is 47:9 But in a moment, in a single day, both of these things will happen. In spite of all the magic you use, you will lose your husband and children. 
23Is 47:10 "You felt sure of yourself in your evil; you thought that no one could see you. Your wisdom and knowledge led you astray, and you said to yourself, 'I am God - there is no one else like me.' 
23Is 47:11 Disaster will come upon you, and none of your magic can stop it. Ruin will come on you suddenly - ruin you never dreamed of ! 
23Is 47:12 Keep all your magic spells and charms; you have used them since you were young. Perhaps they will be of some help to you; perhaps you can frighten your enemies. 
23Is 47:13 You are powerless in spite of the advice you get. Let your astrologers come forward and save you - those people who study the stars, who map out the zones of the heavens and tell you from month to month what is going to happen to you. 
23Is 47:14 "They will be like bits of straw, and a fire will burn them up! They will not even be able to save themselves - the flames will be too hot for them, not a cozy fire to warm themselves by. 
23Is 47:15 That is all the good they will do you - those astrologers you've consulted all your life. They all will leave you and go their own way, and none will be left to save you." 
23Is 48:1 Listen to this, people of Israel, you that are descended from Judah�� You swear by the name of the LORD and claim to worship the God of Israel - but you don't mean a word you say. 
23Is 48:2 And yet you are proud to say that you are citizens of the holy city and that you depend on Israel's God, whose name is the LORD Almighty. 
23Is 48:3 The LORD says to Israel, "Long ago I predicted what would take place; then suddenly I made it happen. 
23Is 48:4 I knew that you would prove to be stubborn, as rigid as iron and unyielding as bronze. 
23Is 48:5 And so I predicted your future long ago, announcing events before they took place, to keep you from claiming that your idols and images made them happen. 
23Is 48:6 "All I foretold has now taken place; you have to admit my predictions were right. Now I will tell you of new things to come, events that I did not reveal before. 
23Is 48:7 Only now am I making them happen; nothing like this took place in the past. If it had, you would claim that you knew all about it. 
23Is 48:8 I knew that you couldn't be trusted, that you have always been known as a rebel. That is why you never heard of this at all, why no word of it ever came to your ears. 
23Is 48:9 "In order that people will praise my name, I am holding my anger in check; I am keeping it back and will not destroy you. 
23Is 48:10 I have tested you in the fire of suffering, as silver is refined in a furnace. But I have found that you are worthless. 
23Is 48:11 What I do is done for my own sake - I will not let my name be dishonored or let anyone else share the glory that should be mine and mine alone." 
23Is 48:12 The LORD says, "Listen to me, Israel, the people I have called! I am God, the first, the last, the only God! 
23Is 48:13 My hands made the earth's foundations and spread the heavens out. When I summon earth and sky, they come at once and present themselves. 
23Is 48:14 "Assemble and listen, all of you! None of the gods could predict that the man I have chosen would attack Babylon; he will do what I want him to do. 
23Is 48:15 I am the one who spoke and called him; I led him out and gave him success. 
23Is 48:16 "Now come close to me and hear what I say. From the beginning I have spoken openly and have always made my words come true." (Now the Sovereign LORD has given me his power and sent me.) 
23Is 48:17 The holy God of Israel, the LORD who saves you, says�� "I am the LORD your God, the one who wants to teach you for your own good and direct you in the way you should go. 
23Is 48:18 "If only you had listened to my commands! Then blessings would have flowed for you like a stream that never goes dry. Victory would have come to you like the waves that roll on the shore. 
23Is 48:19 Your descendants would be as numerous as grains of sand, and I would have made sure they were never destroyed." 
23Is 48:20 Go out from Babylon, go free! Shout the news gladly; make it known everywhere�� "The LORD has saved his servant Israel!" 
23Is 48:21 When the LORD led his people through a hot, dry desert, they did not suffer from thirst. He made water come from a rock for them; he split the rock open, and water flowed out. 
23Is 48:22 "There is no safety for sinners," says the LORD. 
23Is 49:1 Listen to me, distant nations, you people who live far away! Before I was born, the LORD chose me and appointed me to be his servant. 
23Is 49:2 He made my words as sharp as a sword. With his own hand he protected me. He made me like an arrow, sharp and ready for use. 
23Is 49:3 He said to me, "Israel, you are my servant; because of you, people will praise me." 
23Is 49:4 I said, "I have worked, but how hopeless it is! I have used up my strength, but have accomplished nothing." Yet I can trust the LORD to defend my cause; he will reward me for what I do. 
23Is 49:5 Before I was born, the LORD appointed me; he made me his servant to bring back his people, to bring back the scattered people of Israel. The LORD gives me honor; he is the source of my strength. 
23Is 49:6 The LORD said to me, "I have a greater task for you, my servant. Not only will you restore to greatness the people of Israel who have survived, but I will also make you a light to the nations - so that all the world may be saved." 
23Is 49:7 Israel's holy God and savior says to the one who is deeply despised, who is hated by the nations and is the servant of rulers�� "Kings will see you released and will rise to show their respect; princes also will see it, and they will bow low to honor you." This will happen because the LORD has chosen his servant; the holy God of Israel keeps his promises. 
23Is 49:8 The LORD says to his people, "When the time comes to save you, I will show you favor and answer your cries for help. I will guard and protect you and through you make a covenant with all peoples. I will let you settle once again in your land that is now laid waste. 
23Is 49:9 I will say to the prisoners, 'Go free!' and to those who are in darkness, 'Come out to the light!' They will be like sheep that graze on the hills; 
23Is 49:10 they will never be hungry or thirsty. Sun and desert heat will not hurt them, for they will be led by one who loves them. He will lead them to springs of water. 
23Is 49:11 "I will make a highway across the mountains and prepare a road for my people to travel. 
23Is 49:12 My people will come from far away, from the north and the west, and from Aswan in the south." 
23Is 49:13 Sing, heavens! Shout for joy, earth! Let the mountains burst into song! The LORD will comfort his people; he will have pity on his suffering people. 
23Is 49:14 But the people of Jerusalem said, "The LORD has abandoned us! He has forgotten us." 
23Is 49:15 So the LORD answers, "Can a woman forget her own baby and not love the child she bore? Even if a mother should forget her child, I will never forget you. 
23Is 49:16 Jerusalem, I can never forget you! I have written your name on the palms of my hands. 
23Is 49:17 "Those who will rebuild you are coming soon, and those who destroyed you will leave. 
23Is 49:18 Look around and see what is happening! Your people are assembling - they are coming home! As surely as I am the living God, you will be proud of your people, as proud as a bride is of her jewels. 
23Is 49:19 "Your country was ruined and desolate - but now it will be too small for those who are coming to live there. And those who left you in ruins will be far removed from you. 
23Is 49:20 Your people who were born in exile will one day say to you, 'This land is too small - we need more room to live in!' 
23Is 49:21 Then you will say to yourself, 'Who bore all these children for me? I lost my children and could have no more. I was exiled and driven away - who brought these children up? I was left all alone - where did these children come from?' " 
23Is 49:22 The Sovereign LORD says to his people�� "I will signal to the nations, and they will bring your children home. 
23Is 49:23 Kings will be like fathers to you; queens will be like mothers. They will bow low before you and honor you; they will humbly show their respect for you. Then you will know that I am the LORD; no one who waits for my help will be disappointed." 
23Is 49:24 Can you take away a soldier's loot? Can you rescue the prisoners of a tyrant? 
23Is 49:25 The LORD replies, "That is just what is going to happen. The soldier's prisoners will be taken away, and the tyrant's loot will be seized. I will fight against whoever fights you, and I will rescue your children. 
23Is 49:26 I will make your oppressors kill each other; they will be drunk with murder and rage. Then all people will know that I am the LORD, the one who saves you and sets you free. They will know that I am Israel's powerful God." 
23Is 50:1 The LORD says, "Do you think I sent my people away like a man who divorces his wife? Where, then, are the papers of divorce? Do you think I sold you into captivity like a man who sells his children as slaves? No, you went away captive because of your sins; you were sent away because of your crimes. 
23Is 50:2 "Why did my people fail to respond when I went to them to save them? Why did they not answer when I called? Am I too weak to save them? I can dry up the sea with a command and turn rivers into a desert, so that the fish in them die for lack of water. 
23Is 50:3 I can make the sky turn dark, as if it were in mourning for the dead." 
23Is 50:4 The Sovereign LORD has taught me what to say, so that I can strengthen the weary. Every morning he makes me eager to hear what he is going to teach me. 
23Is 50:5 The LORD has given me understanding, and I have not rebelled or turned away from him. 
23Is 50:6 I bared my back to those who beat me. I did not stop them when they insulted me, when they pulled out the hairs of my beard and spit in my face. 
23Is 50:7 But their insults cannot hurt me because the Sovereign LORD gives me help. I brace myself to endure them. I know that I will not be disgraced, 
23Is 50:8 for God is near, and he will prove me innocent. Does anyone dare bring charges against me? Let us go to court together! Let him bring his accusation! 
23Is 50:9 The Sovereign LORD himself defends me - who, then, can prove me guilty? All my accusers will disappear; they will vanish like moth-eaten cloth. 
23Is 50:10 All of you that honor the LORD and obey the words of his servant, the path you walk may be dark indeed, but trust in the LORD, rely on your God. 
23Is 50:11 All of you that plot to destroy others will be destroyed by your own plots. The LORD himself will make this happen; you will suffer a miserable fate. 
23Is 51:1 The LORD says, "Listen to me, you that want to be saved, you that come to me for help. Think of the rock from which you came, the quarry from which you were cut. 
23Is 51:2 Think of your ancestor, Abraham, and of Sarah, from whom you are descended. When I called Abraham, he was childless, but I blessed him and gave him children; I made his descendants numerous. 
23Is 51:3 "I will show compassion to Jerusalem, to all who live in her ruins. Though her land is a desert, I will make it a garden, like the garden I planted in Eden. Joy and gladness will be there, and songs of praise and thanks to me. 
23Is 51:4 "Listen to me, my people, listen to what I say�� I give my teaching to the nations; my laws will bring them light. 
23Is 51:5 I will come quickly and save them; the time of my victory is near. I myself will rule over the nations. Distant lands wait for me to come; they wait with hope for me to save them. 
23Is 51:6 Look up at the heavens; look at the earth! The heavens will disappear like smoke; the earth will wear out like old clothing, and all its people will die like flies. But the deliverance I bring will last forever; my victory will be final. 
23Is 51:7 "Listen to me, you that know what is right, who have my teaching fixed in your hearts. Do not be afraid when people taunt and insult you; 
23Is 51:8 they will vanish like moth-eaten clothing! But the deliverance I bring will last forever; my victory will endure for all time." 
23Is 51:9 Wake up, LORD, and help us! Use your power and save us; use it as you did in ancient times. It was you that cut the sea monster Rahab to pieces. 
23Is 51:10 It was you also who dried up the sea and made a path through the water, so that those you were saving could cross. 
23Is 51:11 Those whom you have rescued will reach Jerusalem with gladness, singing and shouting for joy. They will be happy forever, forever free from sorrow and grief. 
23Is 51:12 The LORD says, "I am the one who strengthens you. Why should you fear mortals, who are no more enduring than grass? 
23Is 51:13 Have you forgotten the LORD who made you, who stretched out the heavens and laid the earth's foundations? Why should you live in constant fear of the fury of those who oppress you, of those who are ready to destroy you? Their fury can no longer touch you. 
23Is 51:14 Those who are prisoners will soon be set free; they will live a long life and have all the food they need. 
23Is 51:15 "I am the LORD your God; I stir up the sea and make its waves roar. My name is the LORD Almighty! 
23Is 51:16 I stretched out the heavens and laid the earth's foundations; I say to Jerusalem, 'You are my people! I have given you my teaching, and I protect you with my hand.' " 
23Is 51:17 Jerusalem, wake up! Rouse yourself and get up! You have drunk the cup of punishment that the LORD in his anger gave you to drink; you drank it down, and it made you stagger. 
23Is 51:18 There is no one to lead you, no one among your people to take you by the hand. 
23Is 51:19 A double disaster has fallen on you�� your land has been devastated by war, and your people have starved. There is no one to show you sympathy. 
23Is 51:20 At the corner of every street your people collapse from weakness; they are like deer caught in a hunter's net. They have felt the force of God's anger. 
23Is 51:21 You suffering people of Jerusalem, you that stagger as though you were drunk, 
23Is 51:22 the LORD your God defends you and says, "I am taking away the cup that I gave you in my anger. You will no longer have to drink the wine that makes you stagger. 
23Is 51:23 I will give it to those who oppressed you, to those who made you lie down in the streets and trampled on you as if you were dirt." 
23Is 52:1 Jerusalem, be strong and great again! Holy city of God, clothe yourself with splendor! The heathen will never enter your gates again. 
23Is 52:2 Shake yourself free, Jerusalem! Rise from the dust and sit on your throne! Undo the chains that bind you, captive people of Zion! 
23Is 52:3 The Sovereign LORD says to his people, "When you became slaves, no money was paid for you; in the same way nothing will be paid to set you free. 
23Is 52:4 When you went to live in Egypt as foreigners, you did so of your own free will; Assyria, however, took you away by force and paid nothing for you. 
23Is 52:5 And now in Babylonia the same thing has happened�� you are captives, and nothing was paid for you. Those who rule over you boast and brag and constantly show contempt for me. 
23Is 52:6 In time to come you will acknowledge that I am God and that I have spoken to you." 
23Is 52:7 How wonderful it is to see a messenger coming across the mountains, bringing good news, the news of peace! He announces victory and says to Zion, "Your God is king!" 
23Is 52:8 Those who guard the city are shouting, shouting together for joy. They can see with their own eyes the return of the LORD to Zion. 
23Is 52:9 Break into shouts of joy, you ruins of Jerusalem! The LORD will rescue his city and comfort his people. 
23Is 52:10 The LORD will use his holy power; he will save his people, and all the world will see it. 
23Is 52:11 Be sure to leave Babylonia, all you that carry the Temple equipment. Touch no forbidden thing; keep yourselves holy and leave. 
23Is 52:12 This time you will not have to leave in a hurry; you will not be trying to escape. The LORD your God will lead you and protect you on every side. 
23Is 52:13 The LORD says, "My servant will succeed in his task; he will be highly honored. 
23Is 52:14 Many people were shocked when they saw him; he was so disfigured that he hardly looked human. 
23Is 52:15 But now many nations will marvel at him, and kings will be speechless with amazement. They will see and understand something they had never known." 
23Is 53:1 The people reply, "Who would have believed what we now report? Who could have seen the LORD's hand in this? 
23Is 53:2 It was the will of the LORD that his servant grow like a plant taking root in dry ground. He had no dignity or beauty to make us take notice of him. There was nothing attractive about him, nothing that would draw us to him. 
23Is 53:3 We despised him and rejected him; he endured suffering and pain. No one would even look at him - we ignored him as if he were nothing. 
23Is 53:4 "But he endured the suffering that should have been ours, the pain that we should have borne. All the while we thought that his suffering was punishment sent by God. 
23Is 53:5 But because of our sins he was wounded, beaten because of the evil we did. We are healed by the punishment he suffered, made whole by the blows he received. 
23Is 53:6 All of us were like sheep that were lost, each of us going his own way. But the LORD made the punishment fall on him, the punishment all of us deserved. 
23Is 53:7 "He was treated harshly, but endured it humbly; he never said a word. Like a lamb about to be slaughtered, like a sheep about to be sheared, he never said a word. 
23Is 53:8 He was arrested and sentenced and led off to die, and no one cared about his fate. He was put to death for the sins of our people. 
23Is 53:9 He was placed in a grave with those who are evil, he was buried with the rich, even though he had never committed a crime or ever told a lie." 
23Is 53:10 The LORD says, "It was my will that he should suffer; his death was a sacrifice to bring forgiveness. And so he will see his descendants; he will live a long life, and through him my purpose will succeed. 
23Is 53:11 After a life of suffering, he will again have joy; he will know that he did not suffer in vain. My devoted servant, with whom I am pleased, will bear the punishment of many and for his sake I will forgive them. 
23Is 53:12 And so I will give him a place of honor, a place among the great and powerful. He willingly gave his life and shared the fate of evil men. He took the place of many sinners and prayed that they might be forgiven." 
23Is 54:1 Jerusalem, you have been like a childless woman, but now you can sing and shout for joy. Now you will have more children than a woman whose husband never left her. 
23Is 54:2 Make the tent you live in larger; lengthen its ropes and strengthen the pegs! 
23Is 54:3 You will extend your boundaries on all sides; your people will get back the land that the other nations now occupy. Cities now deserted will be filled with people. 
23Is 54:4 Do not be afraid - you will not be disgraced again; you will not be humiliated. You will forget your unfaithfulness as a young wife, and your desperate loneliness as a widow. 
23Is 54:5 Your Creator will be like a husband to you - the LORD Almighty is his name. The holy God of Israel will save you - he is the ruler of all the world. 
23Is 54:6 Israel, you are like a young wife, deserted by her husband and deeply distressed. But the LORD calls you back to him and says�� 
23Is 54:7 "For one brief moment I left you; with deep love I will take you back. 
23Is 54:8 I turned away angry for only a moment, but I will show you my love forever." So says the LORD who saves you. 
23Is 54:9 "In the time of Noah I promised never again to flood the earth. Now I promise not to be angry with you again; I will not reprimand or punish you. 
23Is 54:10 The mountains and hills may crumble, but my love for you will never end; I will keep forever my promise of peace." So says the LORD who loves you. 
23Is 54:11 The LORD says, "O Jerusalem, you suffering, helpless city, with no one to comfort you, I will rebuild your foundations with precious stones. 
23Is 54:12 I will build your towers with rubies, your gates with stones that glow like fire, and the wall around you with jewels. 
23Is 54:13 "I myself will teach your people and give them prosperity and peace. 
23Is 54:14 Justice and right will make you strong. You will be safe from oppression and terror. 
23Is 54:15 Whoever attacks you, does it without my consent; whoever fights against you will fall. 
23Is 54:16 "I create the blacksmith, who builds a fire and forges weapons. I also create the soldier, who uses the weapons to kill. 
23Is 54:17 But no weapon will be able to hurt you; you will have an answer for all who accuse you. I will defend my servants and give them victory." The LORD has spoken. 
23Is 55:1 The LORD says, "Come, everyone who is thirsty - here is water! Come, you that have no money - buy grain and eat! Come! Buy wine and milk - it will cost you nothing! 
23Is 55:2 Why spend money on what does not satisfy? Why spend your wages and still be hungry? Listen to me and do what I say, and you will enjoy the best food of all. 
23Is 55:3 "Listen now, my people, and come to me; come to me, and you will have life! I will make a lasting covenant with you and give you the blessings I promised to David. 
23Is 55:4 I made him a leader and commander of nations, and through him I showed them my power. 
23Is 55:5 Now you will summon foreign nations; at one time they did not know you, but now they will come running to join you! I, the LORD your God, the holy God of Israel, will make all this happen; I will give you honor and glory." 
23Is 55:6 Turn to the LORD and pray to him, now that he is near. 
23Is 55:7 Let the wicked leave their way of life and change their way of thinking. Let them turn to the LORD, our God; he is merciful and quick to forgive. 
23Is 55:8 "My thoughts," says the LORD, "are not like yours, and my ways are different from yours. 
23Is 55:9 As high as the heavens are above the earth, so high are my ways and thoughts above yours. 
23Is 55:10 "My word is like the snow and the rain that come down from the sky to water the earth. They make the crops grow and provide seed for planting and food to eat. 
23Is 55:11 So also will be the word that I speak - it will not fail to do what I plan for it; it will do everything I send it to do. 
23Is 55:12 "You will leave Babylon with joy; you will be led out of the city in peace. The mountains and hills will burst into singing, and the trees will shout for joy. 
23Is 55:13 Cypress trees will grow where now there are briers; myrtle trees will come up in place of thorns. This will be a sign that will last forever, a reminder of what I, the LORD, have done." 
23Is 56:1 The LORD says to his people, "Do what is just and right, for soon I will save you. 
23Is 56:2 I will bless those who always observe the Sabbath and do not misuse it. I will bless those who do nothing evil." 
23Is 56:3 A foreigner who has joined the LORD's people should not say, "The LORD will not let me worship with his people." A man who has been castrated should never think that because he cannot have children, he can never be part of God's people. 
23Is 56:4 The LORD says to such a man, "If you honor me by observing the Sabbath and if you do what pleases me and faithfully keep my covenant, 
23Is 56:5 then your name will be remembered in my Temple and among my people longer than if you had sons and daughters. You will never be forgotten." 
23Is 56:6 And the LORD says to those foreigners who become part of his people, who love him and serve him, who observe the Sabbath and faithfully keep his covenant�� 
23Is 56:7 "I will bring you to Zion, my sacred hill, give you joy in my house of prayer, and accept the sacrifices you offer on my altar. My Temple will be called a house of prayer for the people of all nations." 
23Is 56:8 The Sovereign LORD, who has brought his people Israel home from exile, has promised that he will bring still other people to join them. 
23Is 56:9 The LORD has told the foreign nations to come like wild animals and devour his people. 
23Is 56:10 He says, "All the leaders, who are supposed to warn my people, are blind! They know nothing. They are like watch dogs that don't bark - they only lie around and dream. How they love to sleep! 
23Is 56:11 They are like greedy dogs that never get enough. These leaders have no understanding. They each do as they please and seek their own advantage. 
23Is 56:12 'Let's get some wine,' these drunkards say, 'and drink all we can hold! Tomorrow will be even better than today!' " 
23Is 57:1 Good people die, and no one understands or even cares. But when they die, no calamity can hurt them. 
23Is 57:2 Those who live good lives find peace and rest in death. 
23Is 57:3 Come here to be judged, you sinners! You are no better than sorcerers, adulterers, and prostitutes. 
23Is 57:4 Who are you making fun of ? Who are you liars jeering at? 
23Is 57:5 You worship the fertility gods by having sex under those sacred trees of yours. You offer your children as sacrifices in the rocky caves near stream beds. 
23Is 57:6 You take smooth stones from there and worship them as gods. You pour out wine as offerings to them and bring them grain offerings. Do you think I am pleased with all this? 
23Is 57:7 You go to the high mountains to offer sacrifices and have sex. 
23Is 57:8 You set up your obscene idols just inside your front doors. You forsake me; you take off your clothes and climb in your large beds with your lovers, whom you pay to sleep with you. And there you satisfy your lust. 
23Is 57:9 You put on your perfumes and ointments and go to worship the god Molech. To find gods to worship, you send messengers far and wide, even to the world of the dead. 
23Is 57:10 You wear yourselves out looking for other gods, but you never give up. You think your obscene idols give you strength, and so you never grow weak. 
23Is 57:11 The LORD says, "Who are these gods that make you afraid, so that you tell me lies and forget me completely? Have you stopped honoring me because I have kept silent for so long? 
23Is 57:12 You think that what you do is right, but I will expose your conduct, and your idols will not be able to help you. 
23Is 57:13 When you cry for help, let those idols of yours save you! A puff of wind will carry them off ! But those who trust in me will live in the land and will worship me in my Temple." 
23Is 57:14 The LORD says, "Let my people return to me. Remove every obstacle from their path! Build the road and make it ready! 
23Is 57:15 "I am the high and holy God, who lives forever. I live in a high and holy place, but I also live with people who are humble and repentant, so that I can restore their confidence and hope. 
23Is 57:16 I gave my people life, and I will not continue to accuse them or be angry with them forever. 
23Is 57:17 I was angry with them because of their sin and greed, and so I punished them and abandoned them. But they were stubborn and kept on going their own way. 
23Is 57:18 "I have seen how they acted, but I will heal them. I will lead them and help them, and I will comfort those who mourn. 
23Is 57:19 I offer peace to all, both near and far! I will heal my people. 
23Is 57:20 But evil people are like the restless sea, whose waves never stop rolling in, bringing filth and muck. 
23Is 57:21 There is no safety for sinners," says the LORD. 
23Is 58:1 The LORD says, "Shout as loud as you can! Tell my people Israel about their sins! 
23Is 58:2 They worship me every day, claiming that they are eager to know my ways and obey my laws. They say they want me to give them just laws and that they take pleasure in worshiping me." 
23Is 58:3 The people ask, "Why should we fast if the LORD never notices? Why should we go without food if he pays no attention?" The LORD says to them, "The truth is that at the same time you fast, you pursue your own interests and oppress your workers. 
23Is 58:4 Your fasting makes you violent, and you quarrel and fight. Do you think this kind of fasting will make me listen to your prayers? 
23Is 58:5 When you fast, you make yourselves suffer; you bow your heads low like a blade of grass and spread out sackcloth and ashes to lie on. Is that what you call fasting? Do you think I will be pleased with that? 
23Is 58:6 "The kind of fasting I want is this�� Remove the chains of oppression and the yoke of injustice, and let the oppressed go free. 
23Is 58:7 Share your food with the hungry and open your homes to the homeless poor. Give clothes to those who have nothing to wear, and do not refuse to help your own relatives. 
23Is 58:8 "Then my favor will shine on you like the morning sun, and your wounds will be quickly healed. I will always be with you to save you; my presence will protect you on every side. 
23Is 58:9 When you pray, I will answer you. When you call to me, I will respond. "If you put an end to oppression, to every gesture of contempt, and to every evil word; 
23Is 58:10 if you give food to the hungry and satisfy those who are in need, then the darkness around you will turn to the brightness of noon. 
23Is 58:11 And I will always guide you and satisfy you with good things. I will keep you strong and well. You will be like a garden that has plenty of water, like a spring of water that never goes dry. 
23Is 58:12 Your people will rebuild what has long been in ruins, building again on the old foundations. You will be known as the people who rebuilt the walls, who restored the ruined houses." 
23Is 58:13 The LORD says, "If you treat the Sabbath as sacred and do not pursue your own interests on that day; if you value my holy day and honor it by not traveling, working, or talking idly on that day, 
23Is 58:14 then you will find the joy that comes from serving me. I will make you honored all over the world, and you will enjoy the land I gave to your ancestor, Jacob. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
23Is 59:1 Don't think that the LORD is too weak to save you or too deaf to hear your call for help! 
23Is 59:2 It is because of your sins that he doesn't hear you. It is your sins that separate you from God when you try to worship him. 
23Is 59:3 You are guilty of lying, violence, and murder. 
23Is 59:4 You go to court, but you do not have justice on your side. You depend on lies to win your case. You carry out your plans to hurt others. 
23Is 59:5 The evil plots you make are as deadly as the eggs of a poisonous snake. Crush an egg, out comes a snake! 
23Is 59:6 But your plots will do you no good - they are as useless as clothing made of cobwebs! 
23Is 59:7 You are always planning something evil, and you can hardly wait to do it. You never hesitate to murder innocent people. You leave ruin and destruction wherever you go, 
23Is 59:8 and no one is safe when you are around. Everything you do is unjust. You follow a crooked path, and no one who walks that path will ever be safe. 
23Is 59:9 The people say, "Now we know why God does not save us from those who oppress us. We hope for light to walk by, but there is only darkness, 
23Is 59:10 and we grope about like blind people. We stumble at noon, as if it were night, as if we were in the dark world of the dead. 
23Is 59:11 We are frightened and distressed. We long for God to save us from oppression and wrong, but nothing happens. 
23Is 59:12 " LORD, our crimes against you are many. Our sins accuse us. We are well aware of them all. 
23Is 59:13 We have rebelled against you, rejected you, and refused to follow you. We have oppressed others and turned away from you. Our thoughts are false; our words are lies. 
23Is 59:14 Justice is driven away, and right cannot come near. Truth stumbles in the public square, and honesty finds no place there. 
23Is 59:15 There is so little honesty that those who stop doing evil find themselves the victims of crime." The LORD has seen this, and he is displeased that there is no justice. 
23Is 59:16 He is astonished to see that there is no one to help the oppressed. So he will use his own power to rescue them and to win the victory. 
23Is 59:17 He will wear justice like a coat of armor and saving power like a helmet. He will clothe himself with the strong desire to set things right and to punish and avenge the wrongs that people suffer. 
23Is 59:18 He will punish his enemies according to what they have done, even those who live in distant lands. 
23Is 59:19 From east to west everyone will fear him and his great power. He will come like a rushing river, like a strong wind. 
23Is 59:20 The LORD says to his people, "I will come to Jerusalem to defend you and to save all of you that turn from your sins. 
23Is 59:21 And I make a covenant with you�� I have given you my power and my teachings to be yours forever, and from now on you are to obey me and teach your children and your descendants to obey me for all time to come." 
23Is 60:1 Arise, Jerusalem, and shine like the sun; The glory of the LORD is shining on you! 
23Is 60:2 Other nations will be covered by darkness, But on you the light of the LORD will shine; The brightness of his presence will be with you. 
23Is 60:3 Nations will be drawn to your light, And kings to the dawning of your new day. 
23Is 60:4 Look around you and see what is happening�� Your people are gathering to come home! Your sons will come from far away; Your daughters will be carried like children. 
23Is 60:5 You will see this and be filled with joy; You will tremble with excitement. The wealth of the nations will be brought to you; From across the sea their riches will come. 
23Is 60:6 Great caravans of camels will come, from Midian and Ephah. They will come from Sheba, bringing gold and incense. People will tell the good news of what the LORD has done! 
23Is 60:7 All the sheep of Kedar and Nebaioth Will be brought to you as sacrifices And offered on the altar to please the LORD. The LORD will make his Temple more glorious than ever. 
23Is 60:8 What are these ships that skim along like clouds, Like doves returning home? 
23Is 60:9 They are ships coming from distant lands, Bringing God's people home. They bring with them silver and gold To honor the name of the LORD, The holy God of Israel, Who has made all nations honor his people. 
23Is 60:10 The LORD says to Jerusalem, "Foreigners will rebuild your walls, And their kings will serve you. In my anger I punished you, But now I will show you my favor and mercy. 
23Is 60:11 Day and night your gates will be open, So that the kings of the nations May bring you their wealth. 
23Is 60:12 But nations that do not serve you Will be completely destroyed. 
23Is 60:13 "The wood of the pine, the juniper, and the cypress, The finest wood from the forests of Lebanon, Will be brought to rebuild you, Jerusalem, To make my Temple beautiful, To make my city glorious. 
23Is 60:14 The descendants of those who oppressed you will come And bow low to show their respect. All who once despised you will worship at your feet. They will call you 'The City of the LORD,' 'Zion, the City of Israel's Holy God.' 
23Is 60:15 "You will no longer be forsaken and hated, A city deserted and desolate. I will make you great and beautiful, A place of joy forever and ever. 
23Is 60:16 Nations and kings will care for you As a mother nurses her child. You will know that I, the LORD, have saved you, That the mighty God of Israel sets you free. 
23Is 60:17 "I will bring you gold instead of bronze, Silver and bronze instead of iron and wood, And iron instead of stone. Your rulers will no longer oppress you; I will make them rule with justice and peace. 
23Is 60:18 The sounds of violence will be heard no more; Destruction will not shatter your country again. I will protect and defend you like a wall; You will praise me because I have saved you. 
23Is 60:19 "No longer will the sun be your light by day Or the moon be your light by night; I, the LORD, will be your eternal light; The light of my glory will shine on you. 
23Is 60:20 Your days of grief will come to an end. I, the LORD, will be your eternal light, More lasting than the sun and moon. 
23Is 60:21 Your people will all do what is right, And will possess the land forever. I planted them, I made them, To reveal my greatness to all. 
23Is 60:22 Even your smallest and humblest family Will become as great as a powerful nation. When the right time comes, I will make this happen quickly. I am the LORD!" 
23Is 61:1 The Sovereign LORD has filled me with his Spirit. He has chosen me and sent me To bring good news to the poor, To heal the broken-hearted, To announce release to captives And freedom to those in prison. 
23Is 61:2 He has sent me to proclaim That the time has come When the LORD will save his people And defeat their enemies. He has sent me to comfort all who mourn, 
23Is 61:3 To give to those who mourn in Zion Joy and gladness instead of grief, A song of praise instead of sorrow. They will be like trees That the LORD himself has planted. They will all do what is right, And God will be praised for what he has done. 
23Is 61:4 They will rebuild cities that have long been in ruins. 
23Is 61:5 My people, foreigners will serve you. They will take care of your flocks And farm your land and tend your vineyards. 
23Is 61:6 And you will be known as the priests of the LORD, The servants of our God. You will enjoy the wealth of the nations And be proud that it is yours. 
23Is 61:7 Your shame and disgrace are ended. You will live in your own land, And your wealth will be doubled; Your joy will last forever. 
23Is 61:8 The LORD says, "I love justice and I hate oppression and crime. I will faithfully reward my people And make an eternal covenant with them. 
23Is 61:9 They will be famous among the nations; Everyone who sees them will know That they are a people whom I have blessed." 
23Is 61:10 Jerusalem rejoices because of what the LORD has done. She is like a bride dressed for her wedding. God has clothed her with salvation and victory. 
23Is 61:11 As surely as seeds sprout and grow, The Sovereign LORD will save his people, And all the nations will praise him. 
23Is 62:1 I will speak out to encourage Jerusalem; I will not be silent until she is saved, And her victory shines like a torch in the night. 
23Is 62:2 Jerusalem, the nations will see you victorious! All their kings will see your glory. You will be called by a new name, A name given by the LORD himself. 
23Is 62:3 You will be like a beautiful crown for the LORD. 
23Is 62:4 No longer will you be called "Forsaken," Or your land be called "The Deserted Wife." Your new name will be "God Is Pleased with Her." Your land will be called "Happily Married," Because the LORD is pleased with you And will be like a husband to your land. 
23Is 62:5 Like a young man taking a virgin as his bride, He who formed you will marry you. As a groom is delighted with his bride, So your God will delight in you. 
23Is 62:6 On your walls, Jerusalem, I have placed sentries; They must never be silent day or night. They must remind the LORD of his promises And never let him forget them. 
23Is 62:7 They must give him no rest until he restores Jerusalem And makes it a city the whole world praises. 
23Is 62:8 The LORD has made a solemn promise, And by his power he will carry it out�� "Your grain will no longer be food for your enemies, And foreigners will no longer drink your wine. 
23Is 62:9 But you that planted and harvested the grain Will eat the bread and praise the LORD. You that tended and gathered the grapes Will drink the wine in the courts of my Temple." 
23Is 62:10 People of Jerusalem, go out of the city And build a road for your returning people! Prepare a highway; clear it of stones! Put up a signal so that the nations can know 
23Is 62:11 That the LORD is announcing to all the earth�� "Tell the people of Jerusalem That the LORD is coming to save you, Bringing with him the people he has rescued." 
23Is 62:12 You will be called "God's Holy People," "The People the LORD Has Saved." Jerusalem will be called "The City That God Loves," "The City That God Did Not Forsake." 
23Is 63:1 "Who is this coming from the city of Bozrah in Edom? Who is this so splendidly dressed in red, marching along in power and strength?" It is the LORD, powerful to save, coming to announce his victory. 
23Is 63:2 "Why is his clothing so red, like that of someone who tramples grapes to make wine?" 
23Is 63:3 The LORD answers, "I have trampled the nations like grapes, and no one came to help me. I trampled them in my anger, and their blood has stained all my clothing. 
23Is 63:4 I decided that the time to save my people had come; it was time to punish their enemies. 
23Is 63:5 I was amazed when I looked and saw that there was no one to help me. But my anger made me strong, and I won the victory myself. 
23Is 63:6 In my anger I trampled whole nations and shattered them. I poured out their lifeblood on the ground." 
23Is 63:7 I will tell of the LORD's unfailing love; I praise him for all he has done for us. He has richly blessed the people of Israel because of his mercy and constant love. 
23Is 63:8 The LORD said, "They are my people; they will not deceive me." And so he saved them 
23Is 63:9 from all their suffering. It was not an angel, but the LORD himself who saved them. In his love and compassion he rescued them. He had always taken care of them in the past, 
23Is 63:10 but they rebelled against him and made his holy spirit sad. So the LORD became their enemy and fought against them. 
23Is 63:11 But then they remembered the past, the days of Moses, the servant of the LORD, and they asked, "Where now is the LORD, who saved the leaders of his people from the sea? Where is the LORD, who gave his spirit to Moses? 
23Is 63:12 Where is the LORD, who by his power did great things through Moses, dividing the waters of the sea and leading his people through the deep water, to win everlasting fame for himself ?" 
23Is 63:13 Led by the LORD, they were as sure-footed as wild horses, and never stumbled. 
23Is 63:14 As cattle are led into a fertile valley, so the LORD gave his people rest. He led his people and brought honor to his name. 
23Is 63:15 LORD, look upon us from heaven, where you live in your holiness and glory. Where is your great concern for us? Where is your power? Where are your love and compassion? Do not ignore us. 
23Is 63:16 You are our father. Our ancestors Abraham and Jacob do not acknowledge us, but you, LORD, are our father, the one who has always rescued us. 
23Is 63:17 Why do you let us stray from your ways? Why do you make us so stubborn that we turn away from you? Come back, for the sake of those who serve you, for the sake of the people who have always been yours. 
23Is 63:18 We, your holy people, were driven out by our enemies for a little while; they trampled down your sanctuary. 
23Is 63:19 You treat us as though you had never been our ruler, as though we had never been your people. 
23Is 64:1 Why don't you tear the sky open and come down? The mountains would see you and shake with fear. 
23Is 64:2 They would tremble like water boiling over a hot fire. Come and reveal your power to your enemies, and make the nations tremble at your presence! 
23Is 64:3 There was a time when you came and did terrifying things that we did not expect; the mountains saw you and shook with fear. 
23Is 64:4 No one has ever seen or heard of a God like you, who does such deeds for those who put their hope in him. 
23Is 64:5 You welcome those who find joy in doing what is right, those who remember how you want them to live. You were angry with us, but we went on sinning; in spite of your great anger we have continued to do wrong since ancient times. 
23Is 64:6 All of us have been sinful; even our best actions are filthy through and through. Because of our sins we are like leaves that wither and are blown away by the wind. 
23Is 64:7 No one turns to you in prayer; no one goes to you for help. You have hidden yourself from us and have abandoned us because of our sins. 
23Is 64:8 But you are our father, LORD. We are like clay, and you are like the potter. You created us, 
23Is 64:9 so do not be too angry with us or hold our sins against us forever. We are your people; be merciful to us. 
23Is 64:10 Your sacred cities are like a desert; Jerusalem is a deserted ruin, 
23Is 64:11 and our Temple, the sacred and beautiful place where our ancestors praised you, has been destroyed by fire. All the places we loved are in ruins. 
23Is 64:12 LORD, are you unmoved by all this? Are you going to do nothing and make us suffer more than we can endure? 
23Is 65:1 The LORD said, "I was ready to answer my people's prayers, but they did not pray. I was ready for them to find me, but they did not even try. The nation did not pray to me, even though I was always ready to answer, 'Here I am; I will help you.' 
23Is 65:2 I have always been ready to welcome my people, who stubbornly do what is wrong and go their own way. 
23Is 65:3 They shamelessly keep on making me angry. They offer pagan sacrifices at sacred gardens and burn incense on pagan altars. 
23Is 65:4 At night they go to caves and tombs to consult the spirits of the dead. They eat pork and drink broth made from meat offered in pagan sacrifices. 
23Is 65:5 And then they say to others, 'Keep away from us; we are too holy for you to touch!' I cannot stand people like that - my anger against them is like a fire that never goes out. 
23Is 65:6 "I have already decided on their punishment, and their sentence is written down. I will not overlook what they have done, but will repay them 
23Is 65:7 for their sins and the sins of their ancestors. They have burned incense at pagan hill shrines and spoken evil of me. So I will punish them as their past deeds deserve." 
23Is 65:8 The LORD says, "No one destroys good grapes; instead, they make wine with them. Neither will I destroy all my people - I will save those who serve me. 
23Is 65:9 I will bless the Israelites who belong to the tribe of Judah, and their descendants will possess my land of mountains. My chosen people, who serve me, will live there. 
23Is 65:10 They will worship me and will lead their sheep and cattle to pasture in the Plain of Sharon in the west and in Trouble Valley in the east. 
23Is 65:11 "But it will be different for you that forsake me, who ignore Zion, my sacred hill, and worship Gad and Meni, the gods of luck and fate. 
23Is 65:12 It will be your fate to die a violent death, because you did not answer when I called you or listen when I spoke. You chose to disobey me and do evil. 
23Is 65:13 And so I tell you that those who worship and obey me will have plenty to eat and drink, but you will be hungry and thirsty. They will be happy, but you will be disgraced. 
23Is 65:14 They will sing for joy, but you will cry with a broken heart. 
23Is 65:15 My chosen people will use your name as a curse. I, the Sovereign LORD, will put you to death. But I will give a new name to those who obey me. 
23Is 65:16 Anyone in the land who asks for a blessing will ask to be blessed by the faithful God. Whoever takes an oath will swear by the name of the faithful God. The troubles of the past will be gone and forgotten." 
23Is 65:17 The LORD says, "I am making a new earth and new heavens. The events of the past will be completely forgotten. 
23Is 65:18 Be glad and rejoice forever in what I create. The new Jerusalem I make will be full of joy, and her people will be happy. 
23Is 65:19 I myself will be filled with joy because of Jerusalem and her people. There will be no weeping there, no calling for help. 
23Is 65:20 Babies will no longer die in infancy, and all people will live out their life span. Those who live to be a hundred will be considered young. To die before that would be a sign that I had punished them. 
23Is 65:21 People will build houses and get to live in them - they will not be used by someone else. They will plant vineyards and enjoy the wine - it will not be drunk by others. 
23Is 65:22 Like trees, my people will live long lives. They will fully enjoy the things that they have worked for. 
23Is 65:23 The work they do will be successful, and their children will not meet with disaster. I will bless them and their descendants for all time to come. 
23Is 65:24 Even before they finish praying to me, I will answer their prayers. 
23Is 65:25 Wolves and lambs will eat together; lions will eat straw, as cattle do, and snakes will no longer be dangerous. On Zion, my sacred hill, there will be nothing harmful or evil." 
23Is 66:1 The LORD says, "Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house, then, could you build for me, what kind of place for me to live in? 
23Is 66:2 I myself created the whole universe! I am pleased with those who are humble and repentant, who fear me and obey me. 
23Is 66:3 "The people do as they please. It's all the same to them whether they kill a bull as a sacrifice or sacrifice a human being; whether they sacrifice a lamb or break a dog's neck; whether they present a grain offering or offer pigs' blood; whether they offer incense or pray to an idol. They take pleasure in disgusting ways of worship. 
23Is 66:4 So I will bring disaster upon them - the very things they are afraid of - because no one answered when I called or listened when I spoke. They chose to disobey me and do evil." 
23Is 66:5 Listen to what the LORD says, you that fear him and obey him�� "Because you are faithful to me, some of your own people hate you and will have nothing to do with you. They mock you and say, 'Let the LORD show his greatness and save you, so that we may see you rejoice.' But they themselves will be disgraced! 
23Is 66:6 Listen! That loud noise in the city, that sound in the Temple, is the sound of the LORD punishing his enemies! 
23Is 66:7 "My holy city is like a woman who suddenly gives birth to a child without ever going into labor. 
23Is 66:8 Has anyone ever seen or heard of such a thing? Has a nation ever been born in a day? Zion will not have to suffer long, before the nation is born. 
23Is 66:9 Do not think that I will bring my people to the point of birth and not let them be born." The LORD has spoken. 
23Is 66:10 Rejoice with Jerusalem; be glad for her, all you that love this city! Rejoice with her now, all you that have mourned for her! 
23Is 66:11 You will enjoy her prosperity, like a child at its mother's breast. 
23Is 66:12 The LORD says, "I will bring you lasting prosperity; the wealth of the nations will flow to you like a river that never goes dry. You will be like a child that is nursed by its mother, carried in her arms, and treated with love. 
23Is 66:13 I will comfort you in Jerusalem, as a mother comforts her child. 
23Is 66:14 When you see this happen, you will be glad; it will make you strong and healthy. Then you will know that I, the LORD, help those who obey me, and I show my anger against my enemies." 
23Is 66:15 The LORD will come with fire. He will ride on the wings of a storm to punish those he is angry with. 
23Is 66:16 By fire and sword he will punish all the people of the world whom he finds guilty - and many will be put to death. 
23Is 66:17 The LORD says, "The end is near for those who purify themselves for pagan worship, who go in procession to sacred gardens, and who eat pork and mice and other disgusting foods. 
23Is 66:18 I know their thoughts and their deeds. I am coming to gather the people of all the nations. When they come together, they will see what my power can do 
23Is 66:19 and will know that I am the one who punishes them. "But I will spare some of them and send them to the nations and the distant lands that have not heard of my fame or seen my greatness and power�� to Spain, Libya, and Lydia, with its skilled archers, and to Tubal and Greece. Among these nations they will proclaim my greatness. 
23Is 66:20 They will bring back all your people from the nations as a gift to me. They will bring them to my sacred hill in Jerusalem on horses, mules, and camels, and in chariots and wagons, just as Israelites bring grain offerings to the Temple in ritually clean containers. 
23Is 66:21 I will make some of them priests and Levites. 
23Is 66:22 "Just as the new earth and the new heavens will endure by my power, so your descendants and your name will endure. 
23Is 66:23 On every New Moon Festival and every Sabbath people of every nation will come to worship me here in Jerusalem," says the LORD. 
23Is 66:24 "As they leave, they will see the dead bodies of those who have rebelled against me. The worms that eat them will never die, and the fire that burns them will never be put out. The sight of them will be disgusting to all people."
