24Jr 1:1 This book is the account of what was said by Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests of the town of Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin. 
24Jr 1:2 The LORD spoke to Jeremiah in the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon was king of Judah, 
24Jr 1:3 and he spoke to him again when Josiah's son Jehoiakim was king. After that, the LORD spoke to him many times, until the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah son of Josiah. In the fifth month of that year the people of Jerusalem were taken into exile. 
24Jr 1:4 The LORD said to me, 
24Jr 1:5 "I chose you before I gave you life, and before you were born I selected you to be a prophet to the nations." 
24Jr 1:6 I answered, "Sovereign LORD, I don't know how to speak; I am too young." 
24Jr 1:7 But the LORD said to me, "Do not say that you are too young, but go to the people I send you to, and tell them everything I command you to say. 
24Jr 1:8 Do not be afraid of them, for I will be with you to protect you. I, the LORD, have spoken!" 
24Jr 1:9 Then the LORD reached out, touched my lips, and said to me, "Listen, I am giving you the words you must speak. 
24Jr 1:10 Today I give you authority over nations and kingdoms to uproot and to pull down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant." 
24Jr 1:11 The LORD asked me, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" I answered, "A branch of an almond tree." 
24Jr 1:12 "You are right," the LORD said, "and I am watching to see that my words come true." 
24Jr 1:13 Then the LORD spoke to me again. "What else do you see?" he asked. I answered, "I see a pot boiling in the north, and it is about to tip over this way." 
24Jr 1:14 He said to me, "Destruction will boil over from the north on all who live in this land, 
24Jr 1:15 because I am calling all the nations in the north to come. Their kings will set up their thrones at the gates of Jerusalem and around its walls and also around the other cities of Judah. 
24Jr 1:16 I will punish my people because they have sinned; they have abandoned me, have offered sacrifices to other gods, and have made idols and worshiped them. 
24Jr 1:17 Get ready, Jeremiah; go and tell them everything I command you to say. Do not be afraid of them now, or I will make you even more afraid when you are with them. 
24Jr 1:18 Listen, Jeremiah! Everyone in this land - the kings of Judah, the officials, the priests, and the people - will be against you. But today I am giving you the strength to resist them; you will be like a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall. 
24Jr 1:19 They will not defeat you, for I will be with you to protect you. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 2:1 The LORD told me 
24Jr 2:2 to proclaim this message to everyone in Jerusalem. "I remember how faithful you were when you were young, how you loved me when we were first married; you followed me through the desert, through a land that had not been planted. 
24Jr 2:3 Israel, you belonged to me alone; you were my sacred possession. I sent suffering and disaster on everyone who hurt you. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 2:4 Listen to the LORD's message, you descendants of Jacob, you tribes of Israel. 
24Jr 2:5 The LORD says�� "What accusation did your ancestors bring against me? What made them turn away from me? They worshiped worthless idols and became worthless themselves. 
24Jr 2:6 They did not care about me, even though I rescued them from Egypt and led them through the wilderness�� a land of deserts and sand pits, a dry and dangerous land where no one lives and no one will even travel. 
24Jr 2:7 I brought them into a fertile land, to enjoy its harvests and its other good things. But instead they ruined my land; they defiled the country I had given them. 
24Jr 2:8 The priests did not ask, 'Where is the LORD?' My own priests did not know me. The rulers rebelled against me; the prophets spoke in the name of Baal and worshiped useless idols. 
24Jr 2:9 "And so I, the LORD, will state my case against my people again. I will bring charges against their descendants. 
24Jr 2:10 Go west to the island of Cyprus, and send someone eastward to the land of Kedar. You will see that nothing like this has ever happened before. 
24Jr 2:11 No other nation has ever changed its gods, even though they were not real. But my people have exchanged me, the God who has brought them honor, for gods that can do nothing for them. 
24Jr 2:12 And so I command the sky to shake with horror, to be amazed and astonished, 
24Jr 2:13 for my people have committed two sins�� they have turned away from me, the spring of fresh water, and they have dug cisterns, cracked cisterns that can hold no water at all. 
24Jr 2:14 "Israel is not a slave; he was not born into slavery. Why then do his enemies hunt him down? 
24Jr 2:15 They have roared at him like lions; they have made his land a desert, and his towns lie in ruins, completely abandoned. 
24Jr 2:16 Yes, the people of Memphis and Tahpanhes have cracked his skull. 
24Jr 2:17 Israel, you brought this on yourself ! You deserted me, the LORD your God, while I was leading you along the way. 
24Jr 2:18 What do you think you will gain by going to Egypt to drink water from the Nile? What do you think you will gain by going to Assyria to drink water from the Euphrates? 
24Jr 2:19 Your own evil will punish you, and your turning from me will condemn you. You will learn how bitter and wrong it is to abandon me, the LORD your God, and no longer to remain faithful to me. I, the Sovereign LORD Almighty, have spoken." 
24Jr 2:20 The Sovereign LORD says, "Israel, long ago you rejected my authority; you refused to obey me and worship me. On every high hill and under every green tree you worshiped fertility gods. 
24Jr 2:21 I planted you like a choice vine from the very best seed. But look what you have become! You are like a rotten, worthless vine. 
24Jr 2:22 Even if you washed with the strongest soap, I would still see the stain of your guilt. 
24Jr 2:23 How can you say you have not defiled yourself, that you have never worshiped Baal? Look how you sinned in the valley; see what you have done. You are like a wild camel in heat, running around loose, 
24Jr 2:24 rushing into the desert. When she is in heat, who can control her? No male that wants her has to trouble himself; she is always available in mating season. 
24Jr 2:25 Israel, don't wear your feet out, or let your throat become dry from chasing after other gods. But you say, 'No! I can't turn back. I have loved foreign gods and will go after them.' " 
24Jr 2:26 The LORD says, "Just as a thief is disgraced when caught, so all you people of Israel will be disgraced - your kings and officials, your priests and prophets. 
24Jr 2:27 You will all be disgraced - you that say that a tree is your father and that a rock is your mother. This will happen because you turned away from me instead of turning to me. But when you are in trouble, you ask me to come and save you. 
24Jr 2:28 "Where are the gods that you made for yourselves? When you are in trouble, let them save you - if they can! Judah, you have as many gods as you have cities. 
24Jr 2:29 What is your complaint? Why have you rebelled against me? 
24Jr 2:30 I punished you, but it did no good; you would not let me correct you. Like a raging lion, you have murdered your prophets. 
24Jr 2:31 People of Israel, listen to what I am saying. Have I been like a desert to you, like a dark and dangerous land? Why, then, do you say that you will do as you please, that you will never come back to me? 
24Jr 2:32 Does a young woman forget her jewelry, or a bride her wedding dress? But my people have forgotten me for more days than can be counted. 
24Jr 2:33 You certainly know how to chase after lovers. Even the worst of women can learn from you. 
24Jr 2:34 Your clothes are stained with the blood of the poor and innocent, not with the blood of burglars. "But in spite of all this, 
24Jr 2:35 you say, 'I am innocent; surely the LORD is no longer angry with me.' But I, the LORD, will punish you because you deny that you have sinned. 
24Jr 2:36 You have cheapened yourself by turning to the gods of other nations. You will be disappointed by Egypt, just as you were by Assyria. 
24Jr 2:37 You will turn away from Egypt, hanging your head in shame. I, the LORD, have rejected those you trust; you will not gain anything from them." 
24Jr 3:1 The LORD says, "If a man divorces his wife, and she leaves him and becomes another man's wife, he cannot take her back again. This would completely defile the land. But, Israel, you have had many lovers, and now you want to return to me! 
24Jr 3:2 Look up at the hilltops. Is there any place where you have not acted like a prostitute? You waited for lovers along the roadside, as an Arab waits for victims in the desert. You have defiled the land with your prostitution. 
24Jr 3:3 That is why the rains were held back, and the spring showers did not come. You even look like a prostitute; you have no shame. 
24Jr 3:4 "And now you say to me, 'You are my father, and you have loved me ever since I was a child. 
24Jr 3:5 You won't always be angry; you won't be mad at me forever.' Israel, that is what you said, but you did all the evil you could." 
24Jr 3:6 When Josiah was king, the LORD said to me, "Have you seen what Israel, that unfaithful woman, has done? She has turned away from me, and on every high hill and under every green tree she has acted like a prostitute. 
24Jr 3:7 I thought that after she had done all this, she would surely return to me. But she did not return, and her unfaithful sister Judah saw it all. 
24Jr 3:8 Judah also saw that I divorced Israel and sent her away because she had turned from me and had become a prostitute. But Judah, Israel's unfaithful sister, was not afraid. She too became a prostitute 
24Jr 3:9 and was not at all ashamed. She defiled the land, and she committed adultery by worshiping stones and trees. 
24Jr 3:10 And after all this, Judah, Israel's unfaithful sister, only pretended to return to me; she was not sincere. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 3:11 Then the LORD told me that, even though Israel had turned away from him, she had proved to be better than unfaithful Judah. 
24Jr 3:12 He told me to go and say to Israel, "Unfaithful Israel, come back to me. I am merciful and will not be angry; I will not be angry with you forever. 
24Jr 3:13 Only admit that you are guilty and that you have rebelled against the LORD, your God. Confess that under every green tree you have given your love to foreign gods and that you have not obeyed my commands. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 3:14 "Unfaithful people, come back; you belong to me. I will take one of you from each town and two from each clan, and I will bring you back to Mount Zion. 
24Jr 3:15 I will give you rulers who obey me, and they will rule you with wisdom and understanding. 
24Jr 3:16 Then when you have become numerous in that land, people will no longer talk about my Covenant Box. They will no longer think about it or remember it; they will not even need it, nor will they make another one. 
24Jr 3:17 When that time comes, Jerusalem will be called 'The Throne of the LORD,' and all nations will gather there to worship me. They will no longer do what their stubborn and evil hearts tell them. 
24Jr 3:18 Israel will join with Judah, and together they will come from exile in the country in the north and will return to the land that I gave your ancestors as a permanent possession." 
24Jr 3:19 The LORD says, "Israel, I wanted to accept you as my child and give you a delightful land, the most beautiful land in all the world. I wanted you to call me father and never again turn away from me. 
24Jr 3:20 But like an unfaithful wife, you have not been faithful to me. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 3:21 A noise is heard on the hilltops�� it is the people of Israel crying and pleading because they have lived sinful lives and have forgotten the LORD their God. 
24Jr 3:22 Return, all of you who have turned away from the LORD; he will heal you and make you faithful. You say, "Yes, we are coming to the LORD because he is our God. 
24Jr 3:23 We were not helped at all by our pagan worship on the hilltops. Help for Israel comes only from the LORD our God. 
24Jr 3:24 But the worship of Baal, the god of shame, has made us lose flocks and herds, sons and daughters - everything that our ancestors have worked for since ancient times. 
24Jr 3:25 We should lie down in shame and let our disgrace cover us. We and our ancestors have always sinned against the LORD our God; we have never obeyed his commands." 
24Jr 4:1 The LORD says, "People of Israel, if you want to turn, then turn back to me. If you are faithful to me and remove the idols I hate, 
24Jr 4:2 it will be right for you to swear by my name. Then all the nations will ask me to bless them, and they will praise me." 
24Jr 4:3 The LORD says to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, "Plow up your unplowed fields; do not plant your seeds among thorns. 
24Jr 4:4 Keep your covenant with me, your LORD, and dedicate yourselves to me, you people of Judah and Jerusalem. If you don't, my anger will burn like fire because of the evil things you have done. It will burn, and there will be no one to put it out." 
24Jr 4:5 Blow the trumpet throughout the land! Shout loud and clear! Tell the people of Judah and Jerusalem to run to the fortified cities. 
24Jr 4:6 Point the way to Zion! Run for safety! Don't delay! The LORD is bringing disaster and great destruction from the north. 
24Jr 4:7 Like a lion coming from its hiding place, a destroyer of nations has set out. He is coming to destroy Judah. The cities of Judah will be left in ruins, and no one will live in them. 
24Jr 4:8 So put on sackcloth, and weep and wail because the fierce anger of the LORD has not turned away from Judah. 
24Jr 4:9 The LORD said, "On that day kings and officials will lose their courage; priests will be shocked and prophets will be astonished." 
24Jr 4:10 Then I said, "Sovereign LORD, you have completely deceived the people of Jerusalem! You have said there would be peace, but a sword is at their throats." 
24Jr 4:11 The time is coming when the people of Jerusalem will be told that a scorching wind is blowing in from the desert toward them. It will not be a gentle wind that only blows away the chaff - 
24Jr 4:12 the wind that comes at the LORD's command will be much stronger than that! It is the LORD himself who is pronouncing judgment on his people. 
24Jr 4:13 Look, the enemy is coming like clouds. Their war chariots are like a whirlwind, and their horses are faster than eagles. We are lost! We are doomed! 
24Jr 4:14 Jerusalem, wash the evil from your heart, so that you may be saved. How long will you go on thinking sinful thoughts? 
24Jr 4:15 Messengers from the city of Dan and from the hills of Ephraim announce the bad news. 
24Jr 4:16 They have come to warn the nations and to tell Jerusalem that enemies are coming from a country far away. These enemies will shout against the cities of Judah 
24Jr 4:17 and will surround Jerusalem like men guarding a field, because her people have rebelled against the LORD. The LORD has spoken. 
24Jr 4:18 Judah, you have brought this on yourself by the way you have lived and by the things you have done. Your sin has caused this suffering; it has stabbed you through the heart. 
24Jr 4:19 The pain! I can't bear the pain! My heart! My heart is beating wildly! I can't keep quiet; I hear the trumpets and the shouts of battle. 
24Jr 4:20 One disaster follows another; the whole country is left in ruins. Suddenly our tents are destroyed; their curtains are torn to pieces. 
24Jr 4:21 How long must I see the battle raging and hear the blasts of trumpets? 
24Jr 4:22 The LORD says, "My people are stupid; they don't know me. They are like foolish children; they have no understanding. They are experts at doing what is evil, but failures at doing what is good." 
24Jr 4:23 I looked at the earth - it was a barren waste; at the sky - there was no light. 
24Jr 4:24 I looked at the mountains - they were shaking, and the hills were rocking back and forth. 
24Jr 4:25 I saw that there were no people; even the birds had flown away. 
24Jr 4:26 The fertile land had become a desert; its cities were in ruins because of the LORD's fierce anger. 
24Jr 4:27 (The LORD has said that the whole earth will become a wasteland, but that he will not completely destroy it.) 
24Jr 4:28 The earth will mourn; the sky will grow dark. The LORD has spoken and will not change his mind. He has made his decision and will not turn back. 
24Jr 4:29 At the noise of the cavalry and archers everyone will run away. Some will run to the forest; others will climb up among the rocks. Every town will be left empty, and no one will live in them again. 
24Jr 4:30 Jerusalem, you are doomed! Why do you dress in scarlet? Why do you put on jewelry and paint your eyes? You are making yourself beautiful for nothing! Your lovers have rejected you and want to kill you. 
24Jr 4:31 I heard a cry, like a woman in labor, a scream like a woman bearing her first child. It was the cry of Jerusalem gasping for breath, stretching out her hand and saying, "I am doomed! They are coming to kill me!" 
24Jr 5:1 People of Jerusalem, run through your streets! Look around! See for yourselves! Search the marketplaces! Can you find one person who does what is right and tries to be faithful to God? If you can, the LORD will forgive Jerusalem. 
24Jr 5:2 Even though you claim to worship the LORD, you do not mean what you say. 
24Jr 5:3 Surely the LORD looks for faithfulness. He struck you, but you paid no attention; he crushed you, but you refused to learn. You were stubborn and would not turn from your sins. 
24Jr 5:4 Then I thought, "These are only the poor and ignorant. They behave foolishly; they don't know what their God requires, what the LORD wants them to do. 
24Jr 5:5 I will go to the people in power and talk with them. Surely they know what their God requires, what the LORD wants them to do." But all of them have rejected the LORD's authority and refuse to obey him. 
24Jr 5:6 That is why lions from the forest will kill them; wolves from the desert will tear them to pieces, and leopards will prowl through their towns. If those people go out, they will be torn apart because their sins are numerous and time after time they have turned from God. 
24Jr 5:7 The LORD asked, "Why should I forgive the sins of my people? They have abandoned me and have worshiped gods that are not real. I fed my people until they were full, but they committed adultery and spent their time with prostitutes. 
24Jr 5:8 They were like well-fed stallions wild with desire, each lusting for his neighbor's wife. 
24Jr 5:9 Shouldn't I punish them for these things and take revenge on a nation such as this? 
24Jr 5:10 I will send enemies to cut down my people's vineyards, but not to destroy them completely. I will tell them to strip away the branches, because those branches are not mine. 
24Jr 5:11 The people of Israel and Judah have betrayed me completely. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 5:12 The LORD's people have denied him and have said, "He won't really do anything. We won't have hard times; we won't have war or famine." 
24Jr 5:13 They have said that the prophets are nothing but windbags and that they have no message from the LORD. The LORD God Almighty said to me, "Jeremiah, because these people have said such things, I will make my words like a fire in your mouth.
24Jr 5:14 The people will be like wood, and the fire will burn them up." 
24Jr 5:15 People of Israel, the LORD is bringing a nation from far away to attack you. It is a strong and ancient nation, a nation whose language you do not know. 
24Jr 5:16 Their archers are mighty soldiers who kill without mercy. 
24Jr 5:17 They will devour your crops and your food; they will kill your sons and your daughters. They will slaughter your flocks and your herds and destroy your vines and fig trees. The fortified cities in which you trust will be destroyed by their army. 
24Jr 5:18 The LORD says, "Yet even in those days I will not completely destroy my people. 
24Jr 5:19 When they ask why I did all these things, tell them, Jeremiah, that just as they turned away from me and served foreign gods in their own land, so they will serve strangers in a land that is not theirs." 
24Jr 5:20 The LORD says, "Tell the descendants of Jacob, tell the people of Judah�� 
24Jr 5:21 Pay attention, you foolish and stupid people, who have eyes, but cannot see, and have ears, but cannot hear. 
24Jr 5:22 I am the LORD; why don't you fear me? Why don't you tremble before me? I placed the sand as the boundary of the sea, a permanent boundary that it cannot cross. The sea may toss, but it cannot go beyond it; the waves may roar, but they cannot break through. 
24Jr 5:23 But you people! You are stubborn and rebellious; you have turned aside and left me. 
24Jr 5:24 You never thought to honor me, even though I send the autumn rains and the spring rains and give you the harvest season each year. 
24Jr 5:25 Instead, your sins have kept these good things from you. 
24Jr 5:26 "Evildoers live among my people; they lie in wait like those who lay nets to catch birds, but they have set their traps to catch people. 
24Jr 5:27 Just as a hunter fills a cage with birds, they have filled their houses with loot. That is why they are powerful and rich, 
24Jr 5:28 why they are fat and well fed. There is no limit to their evil deeds. They do not give orphans their rights or show justice to the oppressed. 
24Jr 5:29 "But I, the LORD, will punish them for these things; I will take revenge on this nation. 
24Jr 5:30 A terrible and shocking thing has happened in the land�� 
24Jr 5:31 prophets speak nothing but lies; priests rule as the prophets command, and my people offer no objections. But what will they do when it all comes to an end?" 
24Jr 6:1 People of Benjamin, run for safety! Escape from Jerusalem! Sound the trumpet in Tekoa and build a signal fire in Beth Haccherem. Disaster and destruction are about to come from the north. 
24Jr 6:2 The city of Zion is beautiful, but it will be destroyed; 
24Jr 6:3 kings will camp there with their armies. They will pitch their tents around the city, and each of them will camp wherever they want. 
24Jr 6:4 They will say, "Prepare to attack Jerusalem! Get ready! We'll attack at noon!" But then they will say, "It's too late, the day is almost over, and the evening shadows are growing long. 
24Jr 6:5 We'll attack by night; we'll destroy the city's fortresses." 
24Jr 6:6 The LORD Almighty has ordered these kings to cut down trees and build mounds in order to besiege Jerusalem. He has said, "I will punish this city because it is full of oppression. 
24Jr 6:7 As a well keeps its water fresh, so Jerusalem keeps its evil fresh. I hear violence and destruction in the city; sickness and wounds are all I see. 
24Jr 6:8 People of Jerusalem, let these troubles be a warning to you, or else I will abandon you; I will turn your city into a desert, a place where no one lives." 
24Jr 6:9 The LORD Almighty said to me, "Israel will be stripped clean like a vineyard from which every grape has been picked. So you must rescue everyone you can while there is still time." 
24Jr 6:10 I answered, "Who would listen to me if I spoke to them and warned them? They are stubborn and refuse to listen to your message; they laugh at what you tell me to say. 
24Jr 6:11 Your anger against them burns in me too, LORD, and I can't hold it in any longer." Then the LORD said to me, "Pour out my anger on the children in the streets and on the gatherings of the young people. Husbands and wives will be taken away, and even the very old will not be spared. 
24Jr 6:12 Their houses will be given to others, and so will their fields and their wives. I am going to punish the people of this land. 
24Jr 6:13 Everyone, great and small, tries to make money dishonestly; even prophets and priests cheat the people. 
24Jr 6:14 They act as if my people's wounds were only scratches. 'All is well,' they say, when all is not well. 
24Jr 6:15 Were they ashamed because they did these disgusting things? No, they were not at all ashamed; they don't even know how to blush. And so they will fall as others have fallen; when I punish them, that will be the end of them. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 6:16 The LORD said to his people, "Stand at the crossroads and look. Ask for the ancient paths and where the best road is. Walk in it, and you will live in peace." But they said, "No, we will not!" 
24Jr 6:17 Then the LORD appointed sentries to listen for the trumpet's warning. But they said, "We will not listen." 
24Jr 6:18 So the LORD said, "Listen, you nations, and learn what is going to happen to my people. 
24Jr 6:19 Listen, earth! As punishment for all their schemes I am bringing ruin on these people, because they have rejected my teaching and have not obeyed my words. 
24Jr 6:20 What do I care about the incense they bring me from Sheba, or the spices from a distant land? I will not accept their offerings or be pleased with their sacrifices. 
24Jr 6:21 And so I will make these people stumble and fall. Parents and children will die, and so will friends and neighbors." 
24Jr 6:22 The LORD says, "People are coming from a country in the north; a mighty nation far away is preparing for war. 
24Jr 6:23 They have taken up their bows and swords; they are cruel and merciless. They sound like the roaring sea, as they ride their horses. They are ready for battle against Jerusalem." 
24Jr 6:24 "We have heard the news," say the people of Jerusalem, "and our hands hang limp; we are seized by anguish and pain like a woman in labor. 
24Jr 6:25 We don't dare go to the countryside or walk on the roads, because our enemies are armed and terror is all around us." 
24Jr 6:26 The LORD says to his people, "Put on sackcloth and roll in ashes. Mourn with bitter tears as you would for an only child, because the one who comes to destroy you will suddenly attack. 
24Jr 6:27 Jeremiah, test my people, as you would test metal, and find out what they are like. 
24Jr 6:28 They are all stubborn rebels, hard as bronze and iron. They are all corrupt, going around and spreading gossip. 
24Jr 6:29 The furnace burns fiercely, but the waste metals do not melt and run off. It is useless to go on refining my people, because those who are evil are not taken away. 
24Jr 6:30 They will be called worthless dross, because I, the LORD, have rejected them." 
24Jr 7:1 The LORD sent me to the gate of the Temple where the people of Judah went in to worship.
24Jr 7:2 He told me to stand there and announce what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, had to say to them�� 
24Jr 7:3 "Change the way you are living and the things you are doing, and I will let you go on living here. 
24Jr 7:4 Stop believing those deceitful words, 'We are safe! This is the LORD's Temple, this is the LORD's Temple, this is the LORD's Temple!' 
24Jr 7:5 "Change the way you are living and stop doing the things you are doing. Be fair in your treatment of one another. 
24Jr 7:6 Stop taking advantage of aliens, orphans, and widows. Stop killing innocent people in this land. Stop worshiping other gods, for that will destroy you. 
24Jr 7:7 If you change, I will let you go on living here in the land which I gave your ancestors as a permanent possession. 
24Jr 7:8 "Look, you put your trust in deceitful words. 
24Jr 7:9 You steal, murder, commit adultery, tell lies under oath, offer sacrifices to Baal, and worship gods that you had not known before. 
24Jr 7:10 You do these things I hate, and then you come and stand in my presence, in my own Temple, and say, 'We are safe!' 
24Jr 7:11 Do you think that my Temple is a hiding place for robbers? I have seen what you are doing. 
24Jr 7:12 Go to Shiloh, the first place where I chose to be worshiped, and see what I did to it because of the sins of my people Israel. 
24Jr 7:13 You have committed all these sins, and even though I spoke to you over and over again, you refused to listen. You would not answer when I called you. 
24Jr 7:14 And so, what I did to Shiloh I will do to this Temple of mine, in which you trust. Here in this place that I gave to your ancestors and you, I will do the same thing that I did to Shiloh. 
24Jr 7:15 I will drive you out of my sight as I drove out your relatives, the people of Israel. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 7:16 The LORD said, "Jeremiah, do not pray for these people. Do not cry or pray on their behalf; do not plead with me, for I will not listen to you. 
24Jr 7:17 Don't you see what they are doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
24Jr 7:18 The children gather firewood, the men build fires, and the women mix dough to bake cakes for the goddess they call the Queen of Heaven. They also pour out offerings of wine to other gods, in order to hurt me. 
24Jr 7:19 But am I really the one they are hurting? No, they are hurting themselves and bringing shame on themselves. 
24Jr 7:20 And so I, the Sovereign LORD, will pour out my fierce anger on this Temple. I will pour it out on people and animals alike, and even on the trees and the crops. My anger will be like a fire that no one can put out. 
24Jr 7:21 "My people, some sacrifices you burn completely on the altar, and some you are permitted to eat. But what I, the LORD, say is that you might as well eat them all. 
24Jr 7:22 I gave your ancestors no commands about burnt offerings or any other kinds of sacrifices when I brought them out of Egypt. 
24Jr 7:23 But I did command them to obey me, so that I would be their God and they would be my people. And I told them to live the way I had commanded them, so that things would go well for them. 
24Jr 7:24 But they did not obey or pay any attention. Instead, they did whatever their stubborn and evil hearts told them to do, and they became worse instead of better. 
24Jr 7:25 From the day that your ancestors came out of Egypt until this very day I have kept on sending to you my servants, the prophets. 
24Jr 7:26 Yet no one listened or paid any attention. Instead, you became more stubborn and rebellious than your ancestors. 
24Jr 7:27 "So, Jeremiah, you will speak all these words to my people, but they will not listen to you; you will call them, but they will not answer. 
24Jr 7:28 You will tell them that their nation does not obey me, the LORD their God, or learn from their punishment. Faithfulness is dead. No longer is it even talked about. 
24Jr 7:29 "Mourn, people of Jerusalem; cut off your hair and throw it away. Sing a funeral song on the hilltops, because I, the LORD, am angry and have rejected my people. 
24Jr 7:30 "The people of Judah have done an evil thing. They have placed their idols, which I hate, in my Temple and have defiled it. 
24Jr 7:31 In Hinnom Valley they have built an altar called Topheth, so that they can sacrifice their sons and daughters in the fire. I did not command them to do this - it did not even enter my mind. 
24Jr 7:32 And so, the time will come when it will no longer be called Topheth or Hinnom Valley, but Slaughter Valley. They will bury people there because there will be nowhere else to bury them. 
24Jr 7:33 The corpses will be food for the birds and wild animals, and there will be no one to scare them off. 
24Jr 7:34 The land will become a desert. In the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem I will put an end to the sounds of joy and gladness and to the happy sounds of wedding feasts. 
24Jr 8:1 "At that time the bones of the kings and of the officials of Judah, as well as the bones of the priests, of the prophets, and of the other people who lived in Jerusalem, will be taken out of their graves. 
24Jr 8:2 Instead of being gathered and buried, their bones will be like manure lying on the ground. They will be spread out before the sun, the moon, and the stars, which these people have loved and served, and which they have consulted and worshiped. 
24Jr 8:3 And the people of this evil nation who survive, who live in the places where I have scattered them, will prefer to die rather than to go on living. I, the LORD Almighty, have spoken." 
24Jr 8:4 The LORD told me to say to his people, "When someone falls down, doesn't he get back up? If someone misses the road, doesn't he turn back? 
24Jr 8:5 Why then, my people, do you turn away from me without ever turning back? You cling to your idols and refuse to return to me. 
24Jr 8:6 I listened carefully, but you did not speak the truth. Not one of you has been sorry for your wickedness; not one of you has asked, 'What have I done wrong?' Each of you keep on going your own way, like a horse rushing into battle. 
24Jr 8:7 Even storks know when it is time to return; doves, swallows, and thrushes know when it is time to migrate. But, my people, you do not know the laws by which I rule you. 
24Jr 8:8 How can you say that you are wise and that you know my laws? Look, the laws have been changed by dishonest scribes. 
24Jr 8:9 Your wise men are put to shame; they are confused and trapped. They have rejected my words; what wisdom do they have now? 
24Jr 8:10 So I will give their fields to new owners and their wives to other men. Everyone, great and small, tries to make money dishonestly. Even prophets and priests cheat the people. 
24Jr 8:11 They act as if my people's wounds were only scratches. 'All is well,' they say, when all is not well. 
24Jr 8:12 My people, were you ashamed because you did these disgusting things? No, you were not ashamed at all; you don't even know how to blush! And so you will fall as others have fallen; when I punish you, that will be the end of you. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 8:13 "I wanted to gather my people, as a farmer gathers a harvest; but they are like a vine with no grapes, like a fig tree with no figs; even the leaves have withered. Therefore, I have allowed outsiders to take over the land." 
24Jr 8:14 "Why are we sitting still?" God's people ask. "Come on, we will run to the fortified cities and die there. The LORD our God has condemned us to die; he has given us poison to drink, because we have sinned against him. 
24Jr 8:15 We hoped for peace and a time of healing, but it was no use; terror came instead. 
24Jr 8:16 Our enemies are already in the city of Dan; we hear the snorting of their horses. The whole land trembles when their horses neigh. Our enemies have come to destroy our land and everything in it, our city and all its people." 
24Jr 8:17 "Watch out!" the LORD says, "I am sending snakes among you, poisonous snakes that cannot be charmed, and they will bite you." 
24Jr 8:18 My sorrow cannot be healed; I am sick at heart. 
24Jr 8:19 Listen! Throughout the land I hear my people crying out, "Is the LORD no longer in Zion? Is Zion's king no longer there?" The LORD, their king, replies, "Why have you made me angry by worshiping your idols and by bowing down to your useless foreign gods?" 
24Jr 8:20 The people cry out, "The summer is gone, the harvest is over, but we have not been saved." 
24Jr 8:21 My heart has been crushed because my people are crushed; I mourn; I am completely dismayed. 
24Jr 8:22 Is there no medicine in Gilead? Are there no doctors there? Why, then, have my people not been healed? 
24Jr 9:1 I wish my head were a well of water, and my eyes a fountain of tears, so that I could cry day and night for my people who have been killed. 
24Jr 9:2 I wish I had a place to stay in the desert where I could get away from my people. They are all unfaithful, a mob of traitors. 
24Jr 9:3 They are always ready to tell lies; dishonesty instead of truth rules the land. The LORD says, "My people do one evil thing after another and do not acknowledge me as their God." 
24Jr 9:4 Everyone must be on guard against their friends, and no one can trust their relatives; for all relatives are as deceitful as Jacob, and everyone slanders their friends. 
24Jr 9:5 They all mislead their friends, and no one tells the truth; they have taught their tongues to lie and will not give up their sinning. They do one violent thing after another, and one deceitful act follows another. 
24Jr 9:6 The LORD says that his people reject him. 
24Jr 9:7 Because of this the LORD Almighty says, "I will refine my people like metal and put them to the test. My people have done evil - what else can I do with them? 
24Jr 9:8 Their tongues are like deadly arrows; they always tell lies. Everyone speaks friendly words to their neighbors, but they are really setting a trap for them. 
24Jr 9:9 Will I not punish them for these things? Will I not take revenge on a nation like this? I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 9:10 I said, "I will mourn for the mountains and weep for the pastures, because they have dried up, and no one travels through them. The sound of livestock is no longer heard; birds and wild animals have fled and gone." 
24Jr 9:11 The LORD says, "I will make Jerusalem a pile of ruins, a place where jackals live; the cities of Judah will become a desert, a place where no one lives." 
24Jr 9:12 I asked, " LORD, why is the land devastated and dry as a desert, so that no one travels through it? Who is wise enough to understand this? To whom have you explained it so that they can tell others?" 
24Jr 9:13 The LORD answered, "This has happened because my people have abandoned the teaching that I gave them. They have not obeyed me or done what I told them. 
24Jr 9:14 Instead, they have been stubborn and have worshiped the idols of Baal as their ancestors taught them to do. 
24Jr 9:15 So then, listen to what I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, will do�� I will give my people bitter plants to eat and poison to drink. 
24Jr 9:16 I will scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have heard about, and I will send armies against them until I have completely destroyed them." 
24Jr 9:17 The LORD Almighty said, "Think about what is happening! Call for the mourners to come, for the women who sing funeral songs." 
24Jr 9:18 The people said, "Tell them to hurry and sing a funeral song for us, until our eyes fill with tears, and our eyelids are wet from crying." 
24Jr 9:19 Listen to the sound of crying in Zion�� "We are ruined! We are completely disgraced! We must leave our land; our homes have been torn down." 
24Jr 9:20 I said, "Listen to the LORD, you women, and pay attention to his words. Teach your daughters how to mourn, and your friends how to sing a funeral song. 
24Jr 9:21 Death has come in through our windows and entered our palaces; it has cut down the children in the streets and the young men in the marketplaces. 
24Jr 9:22 Dead bodies are scattered everywhere, like piles of manure on the fields, like grain cut and left behind by the reapers, grain that no one gathers. This is what the LORD has told me to say." 
24Jr 9:23 The LORD says, "The wise should not boast of their wisdom, nor the strong of their strength, nor the rich of their wealth. 
24Jr 9:24 If any want to boast, they should boast that they know and understand me, because my love is constant, and I do what is just and right. These are the things that please me. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 9:25 The LORD says, "The time is coming when I will punish the people of Egypt, Judah, Edom, Ammon, Moab, and the desert people, who have their hair cut short. 
24Jr 9:26 All these people are circumcised, but have not kept the covenant it symbolizes. None of these people and none of the people of Israel have kept my covenant." 
24Jr 10:1 People of Israel, listen to the message that the LORD has for you. 
24Jr 10:2 He says, "Do not follow the ways of other nations; do not be disturbed by unusual sights in the sky, even though other nations are terrified. 
24Jr 10:3 The religion of these people is worthless. A tree is cut down in the forest; it is carved by the tools of the woodworker 
24Jr 10:4 and decorated with silver and gold. It is fastened down with nails to keep it from falling over. 
24Jr 10:5 Such idols are like scarecrows in a field of melons; they cannot speak; they have to be carried because they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of them�� they can cause you no harm, and they can do you no good." 
24Jr 10:6 LORD, there is no one like you; you are mighty, and your name is great and powerful. 
24Jr 10:7 Who would not honor you, the king of all nations? You deserve to be honored. There is no one like you among all the wise men of the nations or among any of their kings. 
24Jr 10:8 All of them are stupid and foolish. What can they learn from wooden idols? 
24Jr 10:9 Their idols are covered with silver from Spain and with gold from Uphaz, all the work of artists; they are dressed in violet and purple cloth woven by skilled weavers. 
24Jr 10:10 But you, LORD, are the true God, you are the living God and the eternal king. When you are angry, the world trembles; the nations cannot endure your anger. 
24Jr 10:11 (You people must tell them that the gods who did not make the earth and the sky will be destroyed. They will no longer exist anywhere on earth.) 
24Jr 10:12 The LORD made the earth by his power; by his wisdom he created the world and stretched out the heavens. 
24Jr 10:13 At his command the waters above the sky roar; he brings clouds from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning flash in the rain and sends the wind from his storeroom. 
24Jr 10:14 At the sight of this, people feel stupid and senseless; those who make idols are disillusioned, because the gods they make are false and lifeless. 
24Jr 10:15 They are worthless and should be despised; they will be destroyed when the LORD comes to deal with them. 
24Jr 10:16 The God of Jacob is not like them; he is the one who made everything, and he has chosen Israel to be his very own people. The LORD Almighty is his name. 
24Jr 10:17 People of Jerusalem, you are under siege! Gather up your belongings. 
24Jr 10:18 The LORD is going to throw you out of this land; he is going to crush you until not one of you is left. The LORD has spoken. 
24Jr 10:19 The people of Jerusalem cried out, "How badly we are hurt! Our wounds will not heal. And we thought this was something we could endure! 
24Jr 10:20 Our tents are ruined; the ropes that held them have broken. Our children have all gone away; there is no one left to put up our tents again; there is no one to hang their curtains." 
24Jr 10:21 I answered, "Our leaders are stupid; they do not ask the LORD for guidance. This is why they have failed, and our people have been scattered. 
24Jr 10:22 Listen! News has come! There is a great commotion in a nation to the north; its army will turn the cities of Judah into a desert, a place where jackals live." 
24Jr 10:23 LORD, I know that none of us are in charge of our own destiny; none of us have control over our own life. 
24Jr 10:24 Correct your people, LORD, but do not be too hard on us or punish us when you are angry; that would be the end of us. 
24Jr 10:25 Turn your anger on the nations that do not worship you and on the people who reject you. They have killed your people; they have destroyed us completely and left our country in ruins. 
24Jr 11:1 The LORD said to me, 
24Jr 11:2 "Listen to the terms of the covenant. Tell the people of Judah and of Jerusalem 
24Jr 11:3 that I, the LORD God of Israel, have placed a curse on everyone who does not obey the terms of this covenant. 
24Jr 11:4 It is the covenant I made with their ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, the land that was like a blazing furnace to them. I told them to obey me and to do everything that I had commanded. I told them that if they obeyed, they would be my people and I would be their God. 
24Jr 11:5 Then I would keep the promise I made to their ancestors that I would give them the rich and fertile land which they now have." I said, "Yes, LORD." 
24Jr 11:6 Then the LORD said to me, "Go to the cities of Judah and to the streets of Jerusalem. Proclaim my message there and tell the people to listen to the terms of the covenant and to obey them. 
24Jr 11:7 When I brought their ancestors out of Egypt, I solemnly warned them to obey me, and I have kept on warning the people until this day. 
24Jr 11:8 But they did not listen or obey. Instead, everyone continued to be as stubborn and evil as ever. I had commanded them to keep the covenant, but they refused. So I brought on them all the punishments described in it." 
24Jr 11:9 Then the LORD said to me, "The people of Judah and of Jerusalem are plotting against me. 
24Jr 11:10 They have gone back to the sins of their ancestors, who refused to do what I said; they have worshiped other gods. Both Israel and Judah have broken the covenant that I made with their ancestors. 
24Jr 11:11 So now I, the LORD, warn them that I am going to bring destruction on them, and they will not escape. And when they cry out to me for help, I will not listen to them. 
24Jr 11:12 Then the people of Judah and of Jerusalem will go to the gods to whom they offer sacrifices and will cry out to them for help. But those gods will not be able to save them when this destruction comes. 
24Jr 11:13 The people of Judah have as many gods as they have cities, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem have set up as many altars for sacrifices to that disgusting god Baal as there are streets in the city. 
24Jr 11:14 Jeremiah, don't pray to me or plead with me on behalf of these people. When they are in trouble and call to me for help, I will not listen to them." 
24Jr 11:15 The LORD says, "The people I love are doing evil things. What right do they have to be in my Temple? Do they think they can prevent disaster by making promises and by offering animal sacrifices? Will they then rejoice? 
24Jr 11:16 I once called them a leafy olive tree, full of beautiful fruit; but now, with a roar like thunder I will set its leaves on fire and break its branches. 
24Jr 11:17 "I, the LORD Almighty, planted Israel and Judah; but now I threaten them with disaster. They have brought this on themselves because they have done wrong; they have made me angry by offering sacrifices to Baal." 
24Jr 11:18 The LORD informed me of the plots that my enemies were making against me. 
24Jr 11:19 I was like a trusting lamb taken out to be killed, and I did not know that it was against me that they were planning evil things. They were saying, "Let's chop down the tree while it is still healthy; let's kill him so that no one will remember him any more." 
24Jr 11:20 Then I prayed, "Almighty LORD, you are a just judge; you test people's thoughts and feelings. I have placed my cause in your hands; so let me watch you take revenge on these people." 
24Jr 11:21 The people of Anathoth wanted me killed, and they told me that they would kill me if I kept on proclaiming the LORD's message. 
24Jr 11:22 So the LORD Almighty said, "I will punish them! Their young men will be killed in war; their children will die of starvation. 
24Jr 11:23 I have set a time for bringing disaster on the people of Anathoth, and when that time comes, none of them will survive." 
24Jr 12:1 " LORD, if I argued my case with you, you would prove to be right. Yet I must question you about matters of justice. Why are the wicked so prosperous? Why do dishonest people succeed? 
24Jr 12:2 You plant them, and they take root; they grow and bear fruit. They always speak well of you, yet they do not really care about you. 
24Jr 12:3 But, LORD, you know me; you see what I do and how I love you. Drag these evil people away like sheep to be butchered; guard them until it is time for them to be slaughtered. 
24Jr 12:4 How long will our land be dry, and the grass in every field be withered? Animals and birds are dying because of the wickedness of our people, people who say, 'God doesn't see what we are doing.' " 
24Jr 12:5 The LORD said, "Jeremiah, if you get tired racing against people, how can you race against horses? If you can't even stand up in open country, how will you manage in the jungle by the Jordan? 
24Jr 12:6 Even your relatives, members of your own family, have betrayed you; they join in the attacks against you. Do not trust them, even though they speak friendly words." 
24Jr 12:7 The LORD says, "I have abandoned Israel; I have rejected my chosen nation. I have given the people I love into the power of their enemies. 
24Jr 12:8 My chosen people have turned against me; like a lion in the forest they have roared at me, and so I hate them. 
24Jr 12:9 My chosen people are like a bird attacked from all sides by hawks. Call the wild animals to come and join in the feast! 
24Jr 12:10 Many foreign rulers have destroyed my vineyard; they have trampled down my fields; they have turned my lovely land into a desert. 
24Jr 12:11 They have made it a wasteland; it lies desolate before me. The whole land has become a desert, and no one cares. 
24Jr 12:12 Across all the desert highlands people have come to plunder. I have sent war to destroy the entire land; no one can live in peace. 
24Jr 12:13 My people planted wheat, but gathered weeds; they have worked hard, but got nothing for it. Because of my fierce anger their crops have failed." 
24Jr 12:14 The LORD says, "I have something to say about Israel's neighbors who have ruined the land I gave to my people Israel. I will take those wicked people away from their countries like an uprooted plant, and I will rescue Judah from them. 
24Jr 12:15 But after I have taken them away, I will have mercy on them; I will bring each nation back to its own land and to its own country. 
24Jr 12:16 If with all their hearts they will accept the religion of my people and will swear, 'As the LORD lives' - as they once taught my people to swear by Baal - then they will also be a part of my people and will prosper. 
24Jr 12:17 But if any nation will not obey, then I will completely uproot it and destroy it. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 13:1 The LORD told me to go and buy myself some linen shorts and to put them on; but he told me not to put them in water. 
24Jr 13:2 So I bought them and put them on. 
24Jr 13:3 Then the LORD spoke to me again and said, 
24Jr 13:4 "Go to the Euphrates River and hide the shorts in a hole in the rocks." 
24Jr 13:5 So I went and hid them near the Euphrates. 
24Jr 13:6 Some time later the LORD told me to go back to the Euphrates and get the shorts. 
24Jr 13:7 So I went back, and when I found the place where I had hidden them, I saw that they were ruined and were no longer any good. 
24Jr 13:8 Then the LORD spoke to me again. He said, 
24Jr 13:9 "This is how I will destroy the pride of Judah and the great pride of Jerusalem. 
24Jr 13:10 These evil people have refused to obey me. They have been as stubborn and wicked as ever, and have worshiped and served other gods. So then, they will become like these shorts that are no longer any good. 
24Jr 13:11 Just as shorts fit tightly around the waist, so I intended all the people of Israel and Judah to hold tightly to me. I did this so that they would be my people and would bring praise and honor to my name; but they would not obey me." 
24Jr 13:12 The LORD God said to me, "Jeremiah, tell the people of Israel that every wine jar should be filled with wine. They will answer that they know every wine jar should be filled with wine. 
24Jr 13:13 Then tell them that I, the LORD, am going to fill the people in this land with wine until they are drunk�� the kings, who are David's descendants, the priests, the prophets, and all the people of Jerusalem. 
24Jr 13:14 Then I will smash them like jars against one another, old and young alike. No pity, compassion, or mercy will stop me from killing them." 
24Jr 13:15 People of Israel, the LORD has spoken! Be humble and listen to him. 
24Jr 13:16 Honor the LORD, your God, before he brings darkness, and you stumble on the mountains; before he turns into deep darkness the light you hoped for. 
24Jr 13:17 If you will not listen, I will cry in secret because of your pride; I will cry bitterly, and my tears will flow because the LORD's people have been taken away as captives. 
24Jr 13:18 The LORD said to me, "Tell the king and his mother to come down from their thrones, because their beautiful crowns have fallen from their heads. 
24Jr 13:19 The towns of southern Judah are under siege; no one can get through to them. All the people of Judah have been taken away into exile." 
24Jr 13:20 Jerusalem, look! Your enemies are coming down from the north! Where are the people entrusted to your care, your people you were so proud of ? 
24Jr 13:21 What will you say when people you thought were your friends conquer you and rule over you? You will be in pain like a woman giving birth. 
24Jr 13:22 If you ask why all this has happened to you - why your clothes have been torn off and you have been raped - it is because your sin is so terrible. 
24Jr 13:23 Can people change the color of their skin, or a leopard remove its spots? If they could, then you that do nothing but evil could learn to do what is right. 
24Jr 13:24 The LORD will scatter you like straw that is blown away by the desert wind. 
24Jr 13:25 He has said that this will be your fate. This is what he has decided to do with you, because you have forgotten him and have trusted in false gods. 
24Jr 13:26 The LORD himself will strip off your clothes and expose you to shame. 
24Jr 13:27 He has seen you do the things he hates. He has seen you go after pagan gods on the hills and in the fields, like a man lusting after his neighbor's wife or like a stallion after a mare. People of Jerusalem, you are doomed! When will you ever be pure? 
24Jr 14:1 The LORD said to me concerning the drought, 
24Jr 14:2 "Judah is in mourning; its cities are dying, its people lie on the ground in sorrow, and Jerusalem cries out for help. 
24Jr 14:3 The rich people send their servants for water; they go to the cisterns, but find no water; they come back with their jars empty. Discouraged and confused, they hide their faces. 
24Jr 14:4 Because there is no rain and the ground is dried up, the farmers are sick at heart; they hide their faces. 
24Jr 14:5 In the field the mother deer abandons her newborn fawn because there is no grass. 
24Jr 14:6 The wild donkeys stand on the hilltops and pant for breath like jackals; their eyesight fails them because they have no food. 
24Jr 14:7 My people cry out to me, 'Even though our sins accuse us, help us, LORD, as you have promised. We have turned away from you many times; we have sinned against you. 
24Jr 14:8 You are Israel's only hope; you are the one who saves us from disaster. Why are you like a stranger in our land, like a traveler who stays for only one night? 
24Jr 14:9 Why are you like someone taken by surprise, like a soldier powerless to help? Surely, LORD, you are with us! We are your people; do not abandon us.' " 
24Jr 14:10 The LORD says about these people, "They love to run away from me, and they will not control themselves. So I am not pleased with them. I will remember the wrongs they have done and punish them because of their sins." 
24Jr 14:11 The LORD said to me, "Do not ask me to help these people. 
24Jr 14:12 Even if they fast, I will not listen to their cry for help; and even if they offer me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not be pleased with them. Instead, I will kill them in war and by starvation and disease." 
24Jr 14:13 Then I said, "Sovereign LORD, you know that the prophets are telling the people that there will be no war or starvation, because you have promised, they say, that there will be only peace in our land." 
24Jr 14:14 But the LORD replied, "The prophets are telling lies in my name; I did not send them, nor did I give them any orders or speak one word to them. The visions they talk about have not come from me; their predictions are worthless things that they have imagined. 
24Jr 14:15 I, the LORD, tell you what I am going to do to those prophets whom I did not send but who speak in my name and say war and starvation will not strike this land - I will kill them in war and by starvation. 
24Jr 14:16 The people to whom they have said these things will be killed in the same way. Their bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, and there will be no one to bury them. This will happen to all of them - including their wives, their sons, and their daughters. I will make them pay for their wickedness." 
24Jr 14:17 The LORD commanded me to tell the people about my sorrow and to say�� "May my eyes flow with tears day and night, may I never stop weeping, for my people are deeply wounded and are badly hurt. 
24Jr 14:18 When I go out in the fields, I see the bodies of men killed in war; when I go into the towns, I see people starving to death. Prophets and priests carry on their work, but they don't know what they are doing." 
24Jr 14:19 LORD, have you completely rejected Judah? Do you hate the people of Zion? Why have you hurt us so badly that we cannot be healed? We looked for peace, but nothing good happened; we hoped for healing, but terror came instead. 
24Jr 14:20 We have sinned against you, LORD; we confess our own sins and the sins of our ancestors. 
24Jr 14:21 Remember your promises and do not despise us; do not bring disgrace on Jerusalem, the place of your glorious throne. Do not break the covenant you made with us. 
24Jr 14:22 None of the idols of the nations can send rain; the sky by itself cannot make showers fall. We have put our hope in you, O LORD our God, because you are the one who does these things. 
24Jr 15:1 Then the LORD said to me, "Even if Moses and Samuel were standing here pleading with me, I would not show these people any mercy. Make them go away; make them get out of my sight. 
24Jr 15:2 When they ask you where they should go, tell them that I have said�� Some are doomed to die by disease - that's where they will go! Others are doomed to die in war - that's where they will go! Some are doomed to die of starvation - that's where they will go! Others are doomed to be taken away as prisoners - that's where they will go! 
24Jr 15:3 I, the LORD, have decided that four terrible things will happen to them�� they will be killed in war; their bodies will be dragged off by dogs; birds will eat them, and wild animals will devour what is left over. 
24Jr 15:4 I will make all the people of the world horrified at them because of what Hezekiah's son Manasseh did in Jerusalem when he was king of Judah." 
24Jr 15:5 The LORD says, "Who will pity you, people of Jerusalem, and who will grieve over you? Who will stop long enough to ask how you are? 
24Jr 15:6 You people have rejected me; you have turned your backs on me. So I reached out and crushed you because I was tired of controlling my anger. 
24Jr 15:7 In every town in the land I threw you to the wind like straw. I destroyed you, my people, I killed your children because you did not stop your evil ways. 
24Jr 15:8 There are more widows in your land than grains of sand by the sea. I killed your young men in their prime and made their mothers suffer. I suddenly struck them with anguish and terror. 
24Jr 15:9 The mother who lost her seven children has fainted, gasping for breath. Her daylight has turned to darkness; she is disgraced and sick at heart. I will let your enemies kill those of you who are still alive. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 15:10 What an unhappy man I am! Why did my mother bring me into the world? I have to quarrel and argue with everyone in the land. I have not lent any money or borrowed any; yet everyone curses me. 
24Jr 15:11 LORD, may all their curses come true if I have not served you well, if I have not pleaded with you on behalf of my enemies when they were in trouble and distress. 
24Jr 15:12 (No one can break iron, especially the iron from the north that is mixed with bronze.) 
24Jr 15:13 The LORD said to me, "I will send enemies to carry away the wealth and treasures of my people, in order to punish them for the sins they have committed throughout the land. 
24Jr 15:14 I will make them serve their enemies in a land they know nothing about, because my anger is like fire, and it will burn forever." 
24Jr 15:15 Then I said, " LORD, you understand. Remember me and help me. Let me have revenge on those who persecute me. Do not be so patient with them that they succeed in killing me. Remember that it is for your sake that I am insulted. 
24Jr 15:16 You spoke to me, and I listened to every word. I belong to you, LORD God Almighty, and so your words filled my heart with joy and happiness. 
24Jr 15:17 I did not spend my time with other people, laughing and having a good time. In obedience to your orders I stayed by myself and was filled with anger. 
24Jr 15:18 Why do I keep on suffering? Why are my wounds incurable? Why won't they heal? Do you intend to disappoint me like a stream that goes dry in the summer?" 
24Jr 15:19 To this the LORD replied, "If you return, I will take you back, and you will be my servant again. If instead of talking nonsense you proclaim a worthwhile message, you will be my prophet again. The people will come back to you, and you will not need to go to them. 
24Jr 15:20 I will make you like a solid bronze wall as far as they are concerned. They will fight against you, but they will not defeat you. I will be with you to protect you and keep you safe. 
24Jr 15:21 I will rescue you from the power of wicked and violent people. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 16:1 Again the LORD spoke to me and said, 
24Jr 16:2 "Do not marry or have children in a place like this. 
24Jr 16:3 I will tell you what is going to happen to the children who are born here and to their parents. 
24Jr 16:4 They will die of terrible diseases, and no one will mourn for them or bury them. Their bodies will lie like piles of manure on the ground. They will be killed in war or die of starvation, and their bodies will be food for the birds and the wild animals. 
24Jr 16:5 "You must not enter a house where there is mourning. Do not grieve for anyone. I will no longer bless my people with peace or show them love and mercy. 
24Jr 16:6 The rich and the poor will die in this land, but no one will bury them or mourn for them. Not one of you will gash yourself or shave your head to show your grief. 
24Jr 16:7 No one will eat or drink with anyone to offer comfort when a loved one dies. No one will show sympathy, not even for someone who has lost a father or mother. 
24Jr 16:8 "Do not enter a house where people are feasting. Do not sit down with them to eat and drink. 
24Jr 16:9 Listen to what I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, have to say. I will silence the sounds of joy and gladness and the happy sounds of wedding feasts. The people here will live to see this happen. 
24Jr 16:10 "When you tell them all this, they will ask you why I have decided to punish them so harshly. They will ask what crime they are guilty of and what sin they have committed against the LORD their God. 
24Jr 16:11 Then tell them that the LORD has said, 'Your ancestors turned away from me and worshiped and served other gods. They abandoned me and did not obey my teachings. 
24Jr 16:12 But you have done even worse than your ancestors. All of you are stubborn and evil, and you do not obey me. 
24Jr 16:13 So then, I will throw you out of this land into a land that neither you nor your ancestors have ever known. And there you will serve other gods day and night, and I will show you no mercy.' " 
24Jr 16:14 The LORD says, "The time is coming when people will no longer swear by me as the living God who brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt. 
24Jr 16:15 Instead, they will swear by me as the living God who brought the people of Israel out of a northern land and out of all the other countries where I had scattered them. I will bring them back to their own country, to the land that I gave their ancestors. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 16:16 The LORD says, "I am sending for many fishermen to come and catch these people. Then I will send for many hunters to hunt them down on every mountain and hill and in the caves among the rocks. 
24Jr 16:17 I see everything they do. Nothing is hidden from me; their sins do not escape my sight. 
24Jr 16:18 I will make them pay double for their sin and wickedness, because they have defiled my land with idols that are as lifeless as corpses, and have filled it with their false gods." 
24Jr 16:19 LORD, you are the one who protects me and gives me strength; you help me in times of trouble. Nations will come to you from the ends of the earth and say, "Our ancestors had nothing but false gods, nothing but useless idols. 
24Jr 16:20 Can people make their own gods? No, if they did, those would not really be gods." 
24Jr 16:21 "So then," says the LORD, "once and for all I will make the nations know my power and my might; they will know that I am the LORD." 
24Jr 17:1 The LORD says, "People of Judah, your sin is written with an iron pen; it is engraved on your hearts with a diamond point and carved on the corners of your altars. 
24Jr 17:2 Your people worship at the altars and the symbols that have been set up for the goddess Asherah by every green tree and on the hilltops 
24Jr 17:3 and on the mountains in the open country. I will have your enemies take away your wealth and your treasures because of all the sins you have committed throughout your land. 
24Jr 17:4 You will have to give up the land I gave you, and I will make you serve your enemies in a land you know nothing about, because my anger is like a fire, and it will burn forever." 
24Jr 17:5 The LORD says, "I will condemn those who turn away from me and put their trust in human beings, in the strength of mortals. 
24Jr 17:6 He is like a bush in the desert, which grows in the dry wasteland, on salty ground where nothing else grows. Nothing good ever happens to him. 
24Jr 17:7 "But I will bless the person who puts his trust in me. 
24Jr 17:8 He is like a tree growing near a stream and sending out roots to the water. It is not afraid when hot weather comes, because its leaves stay green; it has no worries when there is no rain; it keeps on bearing fruit. 
24Jr 17:9 "Who can understand the human heart? There is nothing else so deceitful; it is too sick to be healed. 
24Jr 17:10 I, the LORD, search the minds and test the hearts of people. I treat each of them according to the way they live, according to what they do." 
24Jr 17:11 The person who gets money dishonestly is like a bird that hatches eggs it didn't lay. In the prime of life he will lose his riches, and in the end he is nothing but a fool. 
24Jr 17:12 Our Temple is like a glorious throne, standing on a high mountain from the beginning. 
24Jr 17:13 LORD, you are Israel's hope; all who abandon you will be put to shame. They will disappear like names written in the dust, because they have abandoned you, the LORD, the spring of fresh water. 
24Jr 17:14 LORD, heal me and I will be completely well; rescue me and I will be perfectly safe. You are the one I praise! 
24Jr 17:15 The people say to me, "Where are those threats the LORD made against us? Let him carry them out now!" 
24Jr 17:16 But, LORD, I never urged you to bring disaster on them; I did not wish a time of trouble for them. LORD, you know this; you know what I have said. 
24Jr 17:17 Do not be a terror to me; you are my place of safety when trouble comes. 
24Jr 17:18 Bring disgrace on those who persecute me, but spare me, LORD. Fill them with terror, but do not terrify me. Bring disaster on them and break them to pieces. 
24Jr 17:19 The LORD said to me, "Jeremiah, go and announce my message at the People's Gate, through which the kings of Judah enter and leave the city; then go to all the other gates of Jerusalem. 
24Jr 17:20 Tell the kings and all the people of Judah and everyone who lives in Jerusalem and enters these gates, to listen to what I say. 
24Jr 17:21 Tell them that if they love their lives, they must not carry any load on the Sabbath; they must not carry anything in through the gates of Jerusalem 
24Jr 17:22 or carry anything out of their houses on the Sabbath. They must not work on the Sabbath; they must observe it as a sacred day, as I commanded their ancestors. 
24Jr 17:23 Their ancestors did not listen to me or pay any attention. Instead, they became stubborn; they would not obey me or learn from me. 
24Jr 17:24 "Tell these people that they must obey all my commands. They must not carry any load in through the gates of this city on the Sabbath. They must observe the Sabbath as a sacred day and must not do any work at all. 
24Jr 17:25 Then their kings and princes will enter the gates of Jerusalem and have the same royal power that David had. Together with the people of Judah and of Jerusalem, they will ride in chariots and on horses, and the city of Jerusalem will always be filled with people. 
24Jr 17:26 People will come from the towns of Judah and from the villages around Jerusalem; they will come from the territory of Benjamin, from the foothills, from the mountains, and from southern Judah. They will bring to my Temple burnt offerings and sacrifices, grain offerings and incense, as well as thank offerings. 
24Jr 17:27 But they must obey me and observe the Sabbath as a sacred day. They must not carry any load through the gates of Jerusalem on that day, for if they do, I will set the gates of Jerusalem on fire. Fire will burn down the palaces of Jerusalem, and no one will be able to put it out." 
24Jr 18:1 The LORD said to me, 
24Jr 18:2 "Go down to the potter's house, where I will give you my message." 
24Jr 18:3 So I went there and saw the potter working at his wheel. 
24Jr 18:4 Whenever a piece of pottery turned out imperfect, he would take the clay and make it into something else. 
24Jr 18:5 Then the LORD said to me, 
24Jr 18:6 "Don't I have the right to do with you people of Israel what the potter did with the clay? You are in my hands just like clay in the potter's hands. 
24Jr 18:7 If at any time I say that I am going to uproot, break down, or destroy any nation or kingdom, 
24Jr 18:8 but then that nation turns from its evil, I will not do what I said I would. 
24Jr 18:9 On the other hand, if I say that I am going to plant or build up any nation or kingdom, 
24Jr 18:10 but then that nation disobeys me and does evil, I will not do what I said I would. 
24Jr 18:11 Now then, tell the people of Judah and of Jerusalem that I am making plans against them and getting ready to punish them. Tell them to stop living sinful lives - to change their ways and the things they are doing. 
24Jr 18:12 They will answer, 'No, why should we? We will all be just as stubborn and evil as we want to be.' " 
24Jr 18:13 The LORD says, "Ask every nation if such a thing has ever happened before. The people of Israel have done a terrible thing! 
24Jr 18:14 Are Lebanon's rocky heights ever without snow? Do its cool mountain streams ever run dry? 
24Jr 18:15 Yet my people have forgotten me; they burn incense to idols. They have stumbled in the way they should go; they no longer follow the old ways; they walk on unmarked paths. 
24Jr 18:16 They have made this land a thing of horror, to be despised forever. All who pass by will be shocked at what they see; they will shake their heads in amazement. 
24Jr 18:17 I will scatter my people before their enemies, like dust blown by the east wind. I will turn my back on them; I will not help them when the disaster comes." 
24Jr 18:18 Then the people said, "Let's do something about Jeremiah! There will always be priests to instruct us, the wise to give us counsel, and prophets to proclaim God's message. Let's bring charges against him and stop listening to what he says." 
24Jr 18:19 So I prayed, " LORD, hear what I am saying and listen to what my enemies are saying about me. 
24Jr 18:20 Is evil the payment for good? Yet they have dug a pit for me to fall in. Remember how I came to you and spoke on their behalf, so that you would not deal with them in anger. 
24Jr 18:21 But now, LORD, let their children starve to death; let them be killed in war. Let the women lose their husbands and children; let the men die of disease and the young men be killed in battle. 
24Jr 18:22 Send a mob to plunder their homes without warning; make them cry out in terror. They have dug a pit for me to fall in and have set traps to catch me. 
24Jr 18:23 But, LORD, you know all their plots to kill me. Do not forgive their evil or pardon their sin. Throw them down in defeat and deal with them while you are angry." 
24Jr 19:1 The LORD told me to go and buy a clay jar. He also told me to take some of the elders of the people and some of the older priests, 
24Jr 19:2 and to go through Potsherd Gate out to Hinnom Valley. There I was to proclaim the message that he would give me. 
24Jr 19:3 The LORD told me to say, "Kings of Judah and people of Jerusalem, listen to what I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, have to say. I am going to bring such a disaster on this place that everyone who hears about it will be stunned. 
24Jr 19:4 I am going to do this because the people have abandoned me and defiled this place by offering sacrifices here to other gods - gods that neither they nor their ancestors nor the kings of Judah have known anything about. They have filled this place with the blood of innocent people, 
24Jr 19:5 and they have built altars for Baal in order to burn their children in the fire as sacrifices. I never commanded them to do this; it never even entered my mind. 
24Jr 19:6 So then, the time will come when this place will no longer be called Topheth or Hinnom Valley. Instead, it will be known as Slaughter Valley. 
24Jr 19:7 In this place I will frustrate all the plans of the people of Judah and Jerusalem. I will let their enemies triumph over them and kill them in battle. I will give their corpses to the birds and the wild animals as food. 
24Jr 19:8 I will bring such terrible destruction on this city that everyone who passes by will be shocked and amazed. 
24Jr 19:9 The enemy will surround the city and try to kill its people. The siege will be so terrible that the people inside the city will eat one another and even their own children." 
24Jr 19:10 Then the LORD told me to break the jar in front of those who had gone with me 
24Jr 19:11 and to tell them that the LORD Almighty had said, "I will break this people and this city, and it will be like this broken clay jar that cannot be put together again. People will bury their dead even in Topheth because there will be nowhere else to bury them. 
24Jr 19:12 I promise that I will make this city and its inhabitants like Topheth. 
24Jr 19:13 The houses of Jerusalem, the houses of the kings of Judah, and indeed all the houses on whose roofs incense has been burned to the stars and where wine has been poured out as an offering to other gods - they will all be as unclean as Topheth." 
24Jr 19:14 Then I left Topheth, where the LORD had sent me to proclaim his message. I went and stood in the court of the Temple and told all the people 
24Jr 19:15 that the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, had said, "I am going to bring on this city and on every nearby town all the punishment that I said I would, because you are stubborn and will not listen to what I say." 
24Jr 20:1 When the priest Pashhur son of Immer, who was the chief officer of the Temple, heard me proclaim these things, 
24Jr 20:2 he had me beaten and placed in chains near the upper Benjamin Gate in the Temple. 
24Jr 20:3 The next morning, after Pashhur had released me from the chains, I said to him, "The LORD did not name you Pashhur. The name he has given you is 'Terror Everywhere.' 
24Jr 20:4 The LORD himself has said, 'I am going to make you a terror to yourself and to your friends, and you will see them all killed by the swords of their enemies. I am going to put all the people of Judah under the power of the king of Babylonia; he will take some away as prisoners to his country and put others to death. 
24Jr 20:5 I will also let their enemies plunder all the wealth of this city and seize all its possessions and property, even the treasures of the kings of Judah, and carry everything off to Babylonia. 
24Jr 20:6 As for you, Pashhur, you and all your family will also be captured and taken off to Babylonia. There you will die and be buried, along with all your friends to whom you have told so many lies.' " 
24Jr 20:7 LORD, you have deceived me, and I was deceived. You are stronger than I am, and you have overpowered me. Everyone makes fun of me; they laugh at me all day long. 
24Jr 20:8 Whenever I speak, I have to cry out and shout, "Violence! Destruction!" LORD, I am ridiculed and scorned all the time because I proclaim your message. 
24Jr 20:9 But when I say, "I will forget the LORD and no longer speak in his name," then your message is like a fire burning deep within me. I try my best to hold it in, but can no longer keep it back. 
24Jr 20:10 I hear everybody whispering, "Terror is everywhere! So let's report him to the authorities!" Even my close friends wait for my downfall. "Perhaps he can be tricked," they say; "then we can catch him and get revenge." 
24Jr 20:11 But you, LORD, are on my side, strong and mighty, and those who persecute me will fail. They will be disgraced forever, because they cannot succeed. Their disgrace will never be forgotten. 
24Jr 20:12 But, Almighty LORD, you test people justly; you know what is in their hearts and minds. So let me see you take revenge on my enemies, for I have placed my cause in your hands. 
24Jr 20:13 Sing to the LORD! Praise the LORD! He rescues the oppressed from the power of evil people. 
24Jr 20:14 Curse the day I was born! Forget the day my mother gave me birth! 
24Jr 20:15 Curse the one who made my father glad by bringing him the news, "It's a boy! You have a son!" 
24Jr 20:16 May he be like those cities that the LORD destroyed without mercy. May he hear cries of pain in the morning and the battle alarm at noon, 
24Jr 20:17 for not killing me before I was born. Then my mother's womb would have been my grave. 
24Jr 20:18 Why was I born? Was it only to have trouble and sorrow, to end my life in disgrace? 
24Jr 21:1 King Zedekiah of Judah sent to me Pashhur son of Malchiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah with this request�� 
24Jr 21:2 "Please speak to the LORD for us, because King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his army are besieging the city. Maybe the LORD will perform one of his miracles for us and force Nebuchadnezzar to retreat." 
24Jr 21:3 Then the LORD spoke to me, and I told those who had been sent to me 
24Jr 21:4 to tell Zedekiah that the LORD, the God of Israel, had said, "Zedekiah, I am going to defeat your army that is fighting against the king of Babylonia and his army. I will pile up your soldiers' weapons in the center of the city. 
24Jr 21:5 I will fight against you with all my might, my anger, my wrath, and my fury. 
24Jr 21:6 I will kill everyone living in this city; people and animals alike will die of a terrible disease. 
24Jr 21:7 But as for you, your officials, and the people who survive the war, the famine, and the disease - I will let all of you be captured by King Nebuchadnezzar and by your enemies, who want to kill you. Nebuchadnezzar will put you to death. He will not spare any of you or show mercy or pity to any of you. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 21:8 Then the LORD told me to say to the people, "Listen! I, the LORD, am giving you a choice between the way that leads to life and the way that leads to death. 
24Jr 21:9 Anyone who stays in the city will be killed in war or by starvation or disease. But those who go out and surrender to the Babylonians, who are now attacking the city, will not be killed; they will at least escape with their life. 
24Jr 21:10 I have made up my mind not to spare this city, but to destroy it. It will be given over to the king of Babylonia, and he will burn it to the ground. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 21:11 The LORD told me to give this message to the royal house of Judah, the descendants of David�� "Listen to what I, the LORD, am saying. See that justice is done every day. Protect the person who is being cheated from the one who is cheating him.
24Jr 21:12 If you don't, the evil you are doing will make my anger burn like a fire that cannot be put out. 
24Jr 21:13 You, Jerusalem, are sitting high above the valleys, like a rock rising above the plain. But I will fight against you. You say that no one can attack you or break through your defenses. 
24Jr 21:14 But I will punish you for what you have done. I will set your palace on fire, and the fire will burn down everything around it. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 22:1 The LORD told me to go to the palace of the king of Judah, the descendant of David, and there tell the king,
24Jr 22:2 his officials, and the people of Jerusalem to listen to what the LORD had said�� 
24Jr 22:3 "I, the LORD, command you to do what is just and right. Protect the person who is being cheated from the one who is cheating him. Do not mistreat or oppress aliens, orphans, or widows; and do not kill innocent people in this holy place. 
24Jr 22:4 If you really do as I have commanded, then David's descendants will continue to be kings. And they, together with their officials and their people, will continue to pass through the gates of this palace in chariots and on horses. 
24Jr 22:5 But if you do not obey my commands, then I swear to you that this palace will fall into ruins. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 22:6 "To me, Judah's royal palace is as beautiful as the land of Gilead and as the Lebanon Mountains; but I will make it a desolate place where no one lives. 
24Jr 22:7 I am sending men to destroy it. They will all bring their axes, cut down its beautiful cedar pillars, and throw them into the fire. 
24Jr 22:8 "Afterward many foreigners will pass by and ask one another why I, the LORD, have done such a thing to this great city. 
24Jr 22:9 Then they will answer that it is because you have abandoned your covenant with me, your God, and have worshiped and served other gods." 
24Jr 22:10 People of Judah, do not weep for King Josiah; do not mourn his death. But weep bitterly for Joahaz, his son; they are taking him away, never to return, never again to see the land where he was born. 
24Jr 22:11 The LORD says concerning Josiah's son Joahaz, who succeeded his father as king of Judah, "He has gone away from here, never to return. 
24Jr 22:12 He will die in the country where they have taken him, and he will never again see this land." 
24Jr 22:13 Doomed is the one who builds his house by injustice and enlarges it by dishonesty; who makes his people work for nothing and does not pay their wages. 
24Jr 22:14 Doomed is the one who says, "I will build myself a mansion with spacious rooms upstairs." So he puts windows in his house, panels it with cedar, and paints it red. 
24Jr 22:15 Does it make you a better king if you build houses of cedar, finer than those of others? Your father enjoyed a full life. He was always just and fair, and he prospered in everything he did. 
24Jr 22:16 He gave the poor a fair trial, and all went well with him. That is what it means to know the LORD. 
24Jr 22:17 But you can only see your selfish interests; you kill the innocent and violently oppress your people. The LORD has spoken. 
24Jr 22:18 So then, the LORD says about Josiah's son Jehoiakim, king of Judah, "No one will mourn his death or say, 'How terrible, my friend, how terrible!' No one will weep for him or cry, 'My lord! My king!' 
24Jr 22:19 With the funeral honors of a donkey, he will be dragged away and thrown outside Jerusalem's gates." 
24Jr 22:20 People of Jerusalem, go to Lebanon and shout, go to the land of Bashan and cry; call out from the mountains of Moab, because all your allies have been defeated. 
24Jr 22:21 The LORD spoke to you when you were prosperous, but you refused to listen. That is what you've done all your life; you never would obey the LORD. 
24Jr 22:22 Your leaders will be blown away by the wind, your allies taken as prisoners of war, your city disgraced and put to shame because of all the evil you have done. 
24Jr 22:23 You rest secure among the cedars brought from Lebanon; but how pitiful you'll be when pains strike you, pains like those of a woman in labor. 
24Jr 22:24 The LORD said to King Jehoiachin, son of King Jehoiakim of Judah, "As surely as I am the living God, even if you were the signet ring on my right hand, I would pull you off 
24Jr 22:25 and give you to people you are afraid of, people who want to kill you. I will give you to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his soldiers. 
24Jr 22:26 I am going to force you and your mother into exile. You will go to a country where neither of you was born, and both of you will die there. 
24Jr 22:27 You will long to see this country again, but you will never return." 
24Jr 22:28 I said, "Has King Jehoiachin become like a broken jar that is thrown away and that no one wants? Is that why he and his children have been taken into exile to a land they know nothing about?" 
24Jr 22:29 O land, land, land! Listen to what the LORD has said�� 
24Jr 22:30 "This man is condemned to lose his children, to be a man who will never succeed. He will have no descendants who will rule in Judah as David's successors. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 23:1 How terrible will be the LORD's judgment on those rulers who destroy and scatter his people! 
24Jr 23:2 This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says about the rulers who were supposed to take care of his people�� "You have not taken care of my people; you have scattered them and driven them away. Now I am going to punish you for the evil you have done. 
24Jr 23:3 I will gather the rest of my people from the countries where I have scattered them, and I will bring them back to their homeland. They will have many children and increase in number. 
24Jr 23:4 I will appoint rulers to take care of them. My people will no longer be afraid or terrified, and I will not punish them again. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 23:5 The LORD says, "The time is coming when I will choose as king a righteous descendant of David. That king will rule wisely and do what is right and just throughout the land. 
24Jr 23:6 When he is king, the people of Judah will be safe, and the people of Israel will live in peace. He will be called 'The LORD Our Salvation.' 
24Jr 23:7 "The time is coming," says the LORD, "when people will no longer swear by me as the living God who brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt. 
24Jr 23:8 Instead, they will swear by me as the living God who brought the people of Israel out of a northern land and out of all the other countries where I had scattered them. Then they will live in their own land." 
24Jr 23:9 My heart is crushed, and I am trembling. Because of the LORD, because of his holy words, I am like a man who is drunk, someone who has had too much wine. 
24Jr 23:10 The land is full of people unfaithful to the LORD; they live wicked lives and misuse their power. Because of the LORD's curse the land mourns and the pastures are dry. 
24Jr 23:11 The LORD says, "The prophets and the priests are godless; I have caught them doing evil in the Temple itself. 
24Jr 23:12 The paths they follow will be slippery and dark; I will make them stumble and fall. I am going to bring disaster on them; the time of their punishment is coming. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 23:13 I have seen the sin of Samaria's prophets�� they have spoken in the name of Baal and have led my people astray. 
24Jr 23:14 But I have seen the prophets in Jerusalem do even worse�� they commit adultery and tell lies; they help people to do wrong, so that no one stops doing what is evil. To me they are all as bad as the people of Sodom and Gomorrah. 
24Jr 23:15 "So then, this is what I, the LORD Almighty, say about the prophets of Jerusalem�� I will give them bitter plants to eat and poison to drink, because they have spread ungodliness throughout the land." 
24Jr 23:16 The LORD Almighty said to the people of Jerusalem, "Do not listen to what the prophets say; they are filling you with false hopes. They tell you what they have imagined and not what I have said. 
24Jr 23:17 To the people who refuse to listen to what I have said, they keep saying that all will go well with them. And they tell everyone who is stubborn that disaster will never touch them." 
24Jr 23:18 I said, "None of these prophets has ever known the LORD's secret thoughts. None of them has ever heard or understood his message, or ever listened or paid attention to what he said. 
24Jr 23:19 His anger is a storm, a furious wind that will rage over the heads of the wicked, 
24Jr 23:20 and it will not end until he has done everything he intends to do. In days to come his people will understand this clearly." 
24Jr 23:21 The LORD said, "I did not send these prophets, but even so they went. I did not give them any message, but still they spoke in my name. 
24Jr 23:22 If they had known my secret thoughts, then they could have proclaimed my message to my people and could have made them give up the evil lives they live and the wicked things they do. 
24Jr 23:23 "I am a God who is everywhere and not in one place only. 
24Jr 23:24 No one can hide where I cannot see them. Do you not know that I am everywhere in heaven and on earth? 
24Jr 23:25 I know what those prophets have said who speak lies in my name and claim that I have given them my messages in their dreams. 
24Jr 23:26 How much longer will those prophets mislead my people with the lies they have invented? 
24Jr 23:27 They think that the dreams they tell will make my people forget me, just as their ancestors forgot me and turned to Baal. 
24Jr 23:28 The prophet who has had a dream should say it is only a dream, but the prophet who has heard my message should proclaim that message faithfully. What good is straw compared with wheat? 
24Jr 23:29 My message is like a fire and like a hammer that breaks rocks in pieces. 
24Jr 23:30 I am against those prophets who take each other's words and proclaim them as my message. 
24Jr 23:31 I am also against those prophets who speak their own words and claim they came from me. 
24Jr 23:32 Listen to what I, the LORD, say! I am against the prophets who tell their dreams that are full of lies. They tell these dreams and lead my people astray with their lies and their boasting. I did not send them or order them to go, and they are of no help at all to the people. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 23:33 The LORD said to me, "Jeremiah, when one of my people or a prophet or a priest asks you, 'What is the LORD's message?' you are to say, 'You are a burden to the LORD, and he is going to get rid of you.' 
24Jr 23:34 If any of my people or a prophet or a priest even uses the words 'the LORD's burden,' I will punish them and their families. 
24Jr 23:35 Instead, each one of them should ask their friends and their relatives, 'What answer has the LORD given? What has the LORD said?' 
24Jr 23:36 So they must no longer use the words 'the LORD's burden,' because if any of them do, I will make my message a real burden to them. The people have perverted the words of their God, the living God, the LORD Almighty. 
24Jr 23:37 Jeremiah, ask the prophets, 'What answer did the LORD give you? What did the LORD say?' 
24Jr 23:38 And if they disobey my command and use the words 'the LORD's burden,' then tell them that 
24Jr 23:39 I will certainly pick them up and throw them far away from me, both them and the city that I gave to them and their ancestors. 
24Jr 23:40 I will bring on them everlasting shame and disgrace that will never be forgotten." 
24Jr 24:1 The LORD showed me two baskets of figs placed in front of the Temple. (This was after King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia had taken away Jehoiakim's son, King Jehoiachin of Judah, as a prisoner from Jerusalem to Babylonia, together with the leaders of Judah, the craftworkers, and the skilled workers.) 
24Jr 24:2 The first basket contained good figs, those that ripen early; the other one contained bad figs, too bad to eat. 
24Jr 24:3 Then the LORD said to me, "Jeremiah, what do you see?" I answered, "Figs. The good ones are very good, and the bad ones are very bad, too bad to eat." 
24Jr 24:4 So the LORD said to me, 
24Jr 24:5 "I, the LORD, the God of Israel, consider that the people who were taken away to Babylonia are like these good figs, and I will treat them with kindness. 
24Jr 24:6 I will watch over them and bring them back to this land. I will build them up and not tear them down; I will plant them and not pull them up. 
24Jr 24:7 I will give them the desire to know that I am the LORD. Then they will be my people, and I will be their God, because they will return to me with all their heart. 
24Jr 24:8 "As for King Zedekiah of Judah, the politicians around him, and the rest of the people of Jerusalem who have stayed in this land or moved to Egypt - I, the LORD, will treat them all like these figs that are too bad to be eaten. 
24Jr 24:9 I will bring such a disaster on them that all the nations of the world will be terrified. People will make fun of them, make jokes about them, ridicule them, and use their name as a curse everywhere I scatter them. 
24Jr 24:10 I will bring war, starvation, and disease on them until there is not one of them left in the land that I gave to them and their ancestors." 
24Jr 25:1 In the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, I received a message from the LORD concerning all the people of Judah. (This was the first year that Nebuchadnezzar was king of Babylonia.) 
24Jr 25:2 I said to all the people of Judah and of Jerusalem, 
24Jr 25:3 "For twenty-three years, from the thirteenth year that Josiah son of Amon was king of Judah until this very day, the LORD has spoken to me, and I have never failed to tell you what he said. But you have paid no attention. 
24Jr 25:4 You would not listen or pay attention, even though the LORD has continued to send you his servants the prophets. 
24Jr 25:5 They told you to turn from your wicked way of life and from the evil things you are doing, so that you could go on living in the land that the LORD gave you and your ancestors as a permanent possession. 
24Jr 25:6 They told you not to worship and serve other gods and not to make the LORD angry by worshiping the idols you had made. If you had obeyed the LORD, then he would not have punished you. 
24Jr 25:7 But the LORD himself says that you refused to listen to him. Instead, you made him angry with your idols and have brought his punishment on yourselves. 
24Jr 25:8 "So then, because you would not listen to him, the LORD Almighty says, 
24Jr 25:9 'I am going to send for all the peoples from the north and for my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. I am going to bring them to fight against Judah and its inhabitants and against all the neighboring nations. I am going to destroy this nation and its neighbors and leave them in ruins forever, a terrible and shocking sight. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 25:10 I will silence their shouts of joy and gladness and the happy sounds of wedding feasts. They will have no oil for their lamps, and there will be no more grain. 
24Jr 25:11 This whole land will be left in ruins and will be a shocking sight, and the neighboring nations will serve the king of Babylonia for seventy years. 
24Jr 25:12 After that I will punish Babylonia and its king for their sin. I will destroy that country and leave it in ruins forever. 
24Jr 25:13 I will punish Babylonia with all the disasters that I threatened to bring on the nations when I spoke through Jeremiah - all the disasters recorded in this book. 
24Jr 25:14 I will pay the Babylonians back for what they have done, and many nations and great kings will make slaves of them.' " 
24Jr 25:15 The LORD, the God of Israel, said to me, "Here is a wine cup filled with my anger. Take it to all the nations to whom I send you, and make them drink from it. 
24Jr 25:16 When they drink from it, they will stagger and go out of their minds because of the war I am sending against them." 
24Jr 25:17 So I took the cup from the LORD's hand, gave it to all the nations to whom the LORD had sent me, and made them drink from it. 
24Jr 25:18 Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah, together with its kings and leaders, were made to drink from it, so that they would become a desert, a terrible and shocking sight, and so that people would use their name as a curse - as they still do. 
24Jr 25:19 Here is the list of all the others who had to drink from the cup�� 
24Jr 25:20 the king of Egypt, his officials and leaders; all the Egyptians and all the foreigners in Egypt; all the kings of the land of Uz; all the kings of the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and what remains of Ashdod; 
24Jr 25:21 all the people of Edom, Moab, and Ammon; 
24Jr 25:22 all the kings of Tyre and Sidon; all the kings of the Mediterranean lands; 
24Jr 25:23 the cities of Dedan, Tema, and Buz; all the people who cut their hair short;
24Jr 25:24 all the kings of Arabia; all the kings of the desert tribes; 
24Jr 25:25 all the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media; 
24Jr 25:26 all the kings of the north, far and near, one after another. Every nation on the face of the earth had to drink from it. Last of all, the king of Babylonia will drink from it. 
24Jr 25:27 Then the LORD said to me, "Tell the people that I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, am commanding them to drink until they are drunk and vomit, until they fall down and cannot get up, because of the war that I am sending against them. 
24Jr 25:28 And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand and drink from it, then tell them that the LORD Almighty has said that they will still have to drink from it. 
24Jr 25:29 I will begin my work of destruction in my own city. Do they think they will go unpunished? No, they will be punished, for I am going to send war on all the people on earth. I, the LORD Almighty, have spoken. 
24Jr 25:30 "You, Jeremiah, must proclaim everything I have said. You must tell these people, 'The LORD will roar from heaven and thunder from the heights of heaven. He will roar against his people; he will shout like a man treading grapes. Everyone on earth will hear him, 
24Jr 25:31 and the sound will echo to the ends of the earth. The LORD has a case against the nations. He will bring all people to trial and put the wicked to death. The LORD has spoken.' " 
24Jr 25:32 The LORD Almighty says that disaster is coming on one nation after another, and a great storm is gathering at the far ends of the earth. 
24Jr 25:33 On that day the bodies of those whom the LORD has killed will lie scattered from one end of the earth to the other. No one will mourn for them, and they will not be taken away and buried. They will lie on the ground like piles of manure. 
24Jr 25:34 Cry, you leaders, you shepherds of my people, cry out loud! Mourn and roll in the dust. The time has come for you to be slaughtered, and you will be butchered like rams. 
24Jr 25:35 There will be no way for you to escape. 
24Jr 25:36 You moan and cry out in distress 
24Jr 25:37 because the LORD in his anger has destroyed your nation and left your peaceful country in ruins. 
24Jr 25:38 The LORD has abandoned his people like a lion that leaves its cave. The horrors of war and the LORD's fierce anger have turned the country into a desert. 
24Jr 26:1 Soon after Jehoiakim son of Josiah became king of Judah, 
24Jr 26:2 the LORD said to me, "Stand in the court of the Temple and proclaim all I have commanded you to say to the people who come from the towns of Judah to worship there. Do not leave out anything. 
24Jr 26:3 Perhaps the people will listen and give up their evil ways. If they do, then I will change my mind about the destruction I plan to bring on them for all their wicked deeds." 
24Jr 26:4 The LORD told me to say to the people, "I, the LORD, have said that you must obey me by following the teaching that I gave you, 
24Jr 26:5 and by paying attention to the words of my servants, the prophets, whom I have kept on sending to you. You have never obeyed what they said. 
24Jr 26:6 If you continue to disobey, then I will do to this Temple what I did to Shiloh, and all the nations of the world will use the name of this city as a curse." 
24Jr 26:7 The priests, the prophets, and all the people heard me saying these things in the Temple, 
24Jr 26:8 and as soon as I had finished all that the LORD had commanded me to speak, they grabbed me and shouted, "You ought to be killed for this! 
24Jr 26:9 Why have you said in the LORD's name that this Temple will become like Shiloh and that this city will be destroyed and no one will live in it?" Then the people crowded around me. 
24Jr 26:10 When the leaders of Judah heard what had happened, they hurried from the royal palace to the Temple and took their places at the New Gate. 
24Jr 26:11 Then the priests and the prophets said to the leaders and to the people, "This man deserves to be sentenced to death because he has spoken against our city. You heard him with your own ears." 
24Jr 26:12 Then I said, "The LORD sent me to proclaim everything that you heard me say against this Temple and against this city. 
24Jr 26:13 You must change the way you are living and the things you are doing, and must obey the LORD your God. If you do, he will change his mind about the destruction that he said he would bring on you. 
24Jr 26:14 As for me, I am in your power! Do with me whatever you think is fair and right. 
24Jr 26:15 But be sure of this�� if you kill me, you and the people of this city will be guilty of killing an innocent man, because it is the LORD who sent me to give you this warning." 
24Jr 26:16 Then the leaders and the people said to the priests and the prophets, "This man spoke to us in the name of the LORD our God; he should not be put to death." 
24Jr 26:17 After that, some of the elders stood up and said to the people who had gathered, 
24Jr 26:18 "When Hezekiah was king of Judah, the prophet Micah of Moresheth told all the people that the LORD Almighty had said, 'Zion will be plowed like a field; Jerusalem will become a pile of ruins, and the Temple hill will become a forest.' 
24Jr 26:19 King Hezekiah and the people of Judah did not put Micah to death. Instead, Hezekiah honored the LORD and tried to win his favor. And the LORD changed his mind about the disaster that he said he would bring on them. Now we are about to bring a terrible disaster on ourselves." 
24Jr 26:20 (There was another man, Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath Jearim, who spoke in the name of the LORD against this city and nation just as Jeremiah did. 
24Jr 26:21 When King Jehoiakim and his soldiers and officials heard what Uriah had said, the king tried to have him killed. But Uriah heard about it; so he fled in terror and escaped to Egypt. 
24Jr 26:22 King Jehoiakim, however, sent Elnathan son of Achbor and some other men to Egypt to get Uriah. 
24Jr 26:23 They brought him back to King Jehoiakim, who had him killed and his body thrown into the public burial ground.) 
24Jr 26:24 But because I had the support of Ahikam son of Shaphan, I was not handed over to the people and killed. 
24Jr 27:1 Soon after Josiah's son Zedekiah became king of Judah, the LORD told me 
24Jr 27:2 to make myself a yoke out of leather straps and wooden crossbars and to put it on my neck. 
24Jr 27:3 Then the LORD told me to send a message to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through their ambassadors who had come to Jerusalem to see King Zedekiah. 
24Jr 27:4 The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, told me to command them to tell their kings that the LORD had said�� 
24Jr 27:5 "By my great power and strength I created the world, human beings, and all the animals that live on the earth; and I give it to anyone I choose. 
24Jr 27:6 I am the one who has placed all these nations under the power of my servant, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, and I have made even the wild animals serve him. 
24Jr 27:7 All nations will serve him, and they will serve his son and his grandson until the time comes for his own nation to fall. Then his nation will serve powerful nations and great kings. 
24Jr 27:8 "But if any nation or kingdom will not submit to his rule, then I will punish that nation by war, starvation, and disease until I have let Nebuchadnezzar destroy it completely. 
24Jr 27:9 Do not listen to your prophets or to those who claim they can predict the future, either by dreams or by calling up the spirits of the dead or by magic. They all tell you not to submit to the king of Babylonia. 
24Jr 27:10 They are deceiving you and will cause you to be taken far away from your country. I will drive you out, and you will be destroyed. 
24Jr 27:11 But if any nation submits to the king of Babylonia and serves him, then I will let it stay on in its own land, to farm it and live there. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 27:12 I said the same thing to King Zedekiah of Judah, "Submit to the king of Babylonia. Serve him and his people, and you will live. 
24Jr 27:13 Why should you and your people die in war or of starvation or disease? That is what the LORD has said will happen to any nation that does not submit to the king of Babylonia. 
24Jr 27:14 Do not listen to the prophets who tell you not to surrender to him. They are deceiving you. 
24Jr 27:15 The LORD himself has said that he did not send them and that they are lying to you in his name. And so he will drive you out, and you will be killed, you and the prophets who are telling you these lies." 
24Jr 27:16 Then I told the priests and the people that the LORD had said�� "Do not listen to the prophets who say that the Temple treasures will soon be brought back from Babylonia. They are lying to you. 
24Jr 27:17 Don't listen to them! Submit to the king of Babylonia and you will live! Why should this city become a pile of ruins? 
24Jr 27:18 If they are really prophets and if they have my message, let them ask me, the LORD Almighty, not to allow the treasures that remain in the Temple and in the royal palace to be taken to Babylonia." 
24Jr 27:19 (When King Nebuchadnezzar took away to Babylonia the king of Judah, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, and the leading men of Judah and Jerusalem, 
24Jr 27:20 he left the columns, the bronze tank, the carts, and some of the other Temple treasures.) 
24Jr 27:21 "Listen to what I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, say about the treasures that are left in the Temple and in the royal palace in Jerusalem�� 
24Jr 27:22 They will be taken to Babylonia and will remain there until I turn my attention to them. Then I will bring them back and restore them to this place. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 28:1 That same year, in the fifth month of the fourth year that Zedekiah was king, Hananiah son of Azzur, a prophet from the town of Gibeon, spoke to me in the Temple. In the presence of the priests and of the people he told me 
24Jr 28:2 that the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, had said�� "I have broken the power of the king of Babylonia. 
24Jr 28:3 Within two years I will bring back to this place all the Temple treasures that King Nebuchadnezzar took to Babylonia. 
24Jr 28:4 I will also bring back the king of Judah, Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim, along with all of the people of Judah who went into exile in Babylonia. Yes, I will break the power of the king of Babylonia. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 28:5 Then in the presence of the priests and of all the people who were standing in the Temple, I said to Hananiah, 
24Jr 28:6 "Wonderful! I hope the LORD will do this! I certainly hope he will make your prophecy come true and will bring back from Babylonia all the Temple treasures and all the people who were taken away as prisoners. 
24Jr 28:7 But listen to what I say to you and to the people. 
24Jr 28:8 The prophets who spoke long ago, before my time and yours, predicted that war, starvation, and disease would come to many nations and powerful kingdoms. 
24Jr 28:9 But a prophet who predicts peace can only be recognized as a prophet whom the LORD has truly sent when that prophet's predictions come true." 
24Jr 28:10 Then Hananiah took the yoke off my neck, broke it in pieces, 
24Jr 28:11 and said in the presence of all the people, "The LORD has said that this is how he will break the yoke that King Nebuchadnezzar has put on the neck of all the nations; and he will do this within two years." Then I left. 
24Jr 28:12 Some time after this the LORD told me 
24Jr 28:13 to go and tell Hananiah�� "The LORD has said that you may be able to break a wooden yoke, but he will replace it with an iron yoke. 
24Jr 28:14 The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, has said that he will put an iron yoke on all these nations and that they will serve King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. The LORD has said that he will make even the wild animals serve Nebuchadnezzar." 
24Jr 28:15 Then I told Hananiah this, and added, "Listen, Hananiah! The LORD did not send you, and you are making these people believe a lie. 
24Jr 28:16 And so the LORD himself says that he is going to get rid of you. Before this year is over you will die because you have told the people to rebel against the LORD." 
24Jr 28:17 And Hananiah died in the seventh month of that same year. 
24Jr 29:1 I wrote a letter to the priests, the prophets, the leaders of the people, and to all the others whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken away as prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylonia. 
24Jr 29:2 I wrote it after King Jehoiachin, his mother, the palace officials, the leaders of Judah and of Jerusalem, the engravers, and the skilled workers had been taken into exile. 
24Jr 29:3 I gave the letter to Elasah son of Shaphan and to Gemariah son of Hilkiah, whom King Zedekiah of Judah was sending to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. It said�� 
24Jr 29:4 "The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says to all those people whom he allowed Nebuchadnezzar to take away as prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylonia�� 
24Jr 29:5 'Build houses and settle down. Plant gardens and eat what you grow in them. 
24Jr 29:6 Marry and have children. Then let your children get married, so that they also may have children. You must increase in numbers and not decrease. 
24Jr 29:7 Work for the good of the cities where I have made you go as prisoners. Pray to me on their behalf, because if they are prosperous, you will be prosperous too. 
24Jr 29:8 I, the LORD, the God of Israel, warn you not to let yourselves be deceived by the prophets who live among you or by any others who claim they can predict the future. Do not pay any attention to their dreams. 
24Jr 29:9 They are telling you lies in my name. I did not send them. I, the LORD Almighty, have spoken.' 
24Jr 29:10 "The LORD says, 'When Babylonia's seventy years are over, I will show my concern for you and keep my promise to bring you back home. 
24Jr 29:11 I alone know the plans I have for you, plans to bring you prosperity and not disaster, plans to bring about the future you hope for. 
24Jr 29:12 Then you will call to me. You will come and pray to me, and I will answer you. 
24Jr 29:13 You will seek me, and you will find me because you will seek me with all your heart. 
24Jr 29:14 Yes, I say, you will find me, and I will restore you to your land. I will gather you from every country and from every place to which I have scattered you, and I will bring you back to the land from which I had sent you away into exile. I, the LORD, have spoken.' 
24Jr 29:15 "You say that the LORD has given you prophets in Babylonia. 
24Jr 29:16 Listen to what the LORD says about the king who rules the kingdom that David ruled and about the people of this city, that is, your relatives who were not taken away as prisoners with you. 
24Jr 29:17 The LORD Almighty says, 'I am bringing war, starvation, and disease on them, and I will make them like figs that are too rotten to be eaten. 
24Jr 29:18 I will pursue them with war, starvation, and disease, and all the nations of the world will be horrified at what they see. Everywhere I scatter them, people will be shocked and terrified at what has happened to them. People will make fun of them and use their name as a curse. 
24Jr 29:19 This will happen to them because they did not obey the message that I kept on sending to them through my servants the prophets. They refused to listen. 
24Jr 29:20 All of you whom I sent into exile in Babylonia, listen to what I, the LORD, say.' 
24Jr 29:21 "The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, has spoken about Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah, who are telling you lies in his name. He has said that he will hand them over to the power of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, who will put them to death before your eyes. 
24Jr 29:22 When the people who were taken away as prisoners from Jerusalem to Babylonia want to bring a curse on someone, they will say, 'May the LORD treat you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylonia roasted alive!' 
24Jr 29:23 This will be their fate because they are guilty of terrible sins - they have committed adultery and have told lies in the LORD's name. This was against the LORD's will; he knows what they have done, and he is a witness against them. The LORD has spoken." 
24Jr 29:24 The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, gave me a message for Shemaiah of Nehelam, who had sent a letter in his own name to all the people of Jerusalem and to the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah
24Jr 29:25 and to all the other priests. In this letter Shemaiah wrote to Zephaniah�� 
24Jr 29:26 "The LORD made you a priest in place of Jehoiada, and you are now the chief officer in the Temple. It is your duty to see that every crazy person who pretends to be a prophet is placed in chains with an iron collar around the neck. 
24Jr 29:27 Why haven't you done this to Jeremiah of Anathoth, who has been speaking as a prophet to the people? 
24Jr 29:28 He must be stopped because he told the people in Babylonia that they would be prisoners there a long time and should build houses, settle down, plant gardens, and eat what they grow." 
24Jr 29:29 Zephaniah read the letter to me, 
24Jr 29:30 and then the LORD told me 
24Jr 29:31 to send to all the prisoners in Babylon this message about Shemaiah�� "I, the LORD, will punish Shemaiah and all of his descendants. I did not send him, but he spoke to you as if he were a prophet, and he made you believe lies. 
24Jr 29:32 He will have no descendants among you. He will not live to see the good things that I am going to do for my people, because he told them to rebel against me. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 30:1 The LORD, the God of Israel, 
24Jr 30:2 said to me, "Write down in a book everything that I have told you, 
24Jr 30:3 because the time is coming when I will restore my people, Israel and Judah. I will bring them back to the land that I gave their ancestors, and they will take possession of it again. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 30:4 The LORD says to the people of Israel and Judah, 
24Jr 30:5 "I heard a cry of terror, a cry of fear and not of peace. 
24Jr 30:6 Now stop and think! Can a man give birth to a child? Why then do I see every man with his hands on his stomach like a woman in labor? Why is everyone so pale? 
24Jr 30:7 A terrible day is coming; no other day can compare with it - a time of distress for my people, but they will survive." 
24Jr 30:8 The LORD Almighty says, "When that day comes, I will break the yoke that is around their neck and remove their chains, and they will no longer be the slaves of foreigners. 
24Jr 30:9 Instead, they will serve me, the LORD their God, and a descendant of David, whom I will enthrone as king. 
24Jr 30:10 "My people, do not be afraid; people of Israel, do not be terrified. I will rescue you from that faraway land, from the land where you are prisoners. You will come back home and live in peace; you will be secure, and no one will make you afraid. 
24Jr 30:11 I will come to you and save you. I will destroy all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not destroy you. I will not let you go unpunished; but when I punish you, I will be fair. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 30:12 The LORD says to his people, "Your wounds are incurable, your injuries cannot be healed. 
24Jr 30:13 There is no one to take care of you, no remedy for your sores, no hope of healing for you. 
24Jr 30:14 All your lovers have forgotten you; they no longer care about you. I have attacked you like an enemy; your punishment has been harsh because your sins are many and your wickedness is great. 
24Jr 30:15 Complain no more about your injuries; there is no cure for you. I punished you like this because your sins are many and your wickedness is great. 
24Jr 30:16 But now, all who devour you will be devoured, and all your enemies will be taken away as prisoners. All who oppress you will be oppressed, and all who plunder you will be plundered. 
24Jr 30:17 I will make you well again; I will heal your wounds, though your enemies say, 'Zion is an outcast; no one cares about her.' I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 30:18 The LORD says, "I will restore my people to their land and have mercy on every family; Jerusalem will be rebuilt, and its palace restored. 
24Jr 30:19 The people who live there will sing praise; they will shout for joy. By my blessing they will increase in numbers; my blessing will bring them honor. 
24Jr 30:20 I will restore the nation's ancient power and establish it firmly again; I will punish all who oppress them. 
24Jr 30:21 Their ruler will come from their own nation, their prince from their own people. He will approach me when I invite him, for who would dare come uninvited? 
24Jr 30:22 They will be my people, and I will be their God. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 30:23 The LORD's anger is a storm, a furious wind that will rage over the heads of the wicked. 
24Jr 30:24 It will not end until he has done all that he intends to do. In days to come his people will understand this clearly. 
24Jr 31:1 The LORD says, "The time is coming when I will be the God of all the tribes of Israel, and they will be my people. 
24Jr 31:2 In the desert I showed mercy to those people who had escaped death. When the people of Israel longed for rest, 
24Jr 31:3 I appeared to them from far away. People of Israel, I have always loved you, so I continue to show you my constant love. 
24Jr 31:4 Once again I will rebuild you. Once again you will take up your tambourines and dance joyfully. 
24Jr 31:5 Once again you will plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria, and those who plant them will eat what the vineyards produce. 
24Jr 31:6 Yes, the time is coming when sentries will call out on the hills of Ephraim, 'Let's go up to Zion, to the LORD our God.' " 
24Jr 31:7 The LORD says, "Sing with joy for Israel, the greatest of the nations. Sing your song of praise, 'The LORD has saved his people; he has rescued all who are left.' 
24Jr 31:8 I will bring them from the north and gather them from the ends of the earth. The blind and the lame will come with them, pregnant women and those about to give birth. They will come back a great nation. 
24Jr 31:9 My people will return weeping, praying as I lead them back. I will guide them to streams of water, on a smooth road where they will not stumble. I am like a father to Israel, and Ephraim is my oldest son." 
24Jr 31:10 The LORD says, "Nations, listen to me and proclaim my words on the far-off shores. I scattered my people, but I will gather them and guard them as a shepherd guards his flock. 
24Jr 31:11 I have set Israel's people free and have saved them from a mighty nation. 
24Jr 31:12 They will come and sing for joy on Mount Zion and be delighted with my gifts - gifts of grain and wine and olive oil, gifts of sheep and cattle. They will be like a well-watered garden; they will have everything they need. 
24Jr 31:13 Then the young women will dance and be happy, and men, young and old, will rejoice. I will comfort them and turn their mourning into joy, their sorrow into gladness. 
24Jr 31:14 I will fill the priests with the richest food and satisfy all the needs of my people. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 31:15 The LORD says, "A sound is heard in Ramah, the sound of bitter weeping. Rachel is crying for her children; they are gone, and she refuses to be comforted. 
24Jr 31:16 Stop your crying and wipe away your tears. All that you have done for your children will not go unrewarded; they will return from the enemy's land. 
24Jr 31:17 There is hope for your future; your children will come back home. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 31:18 "I hear the people of Israel say in grief, ' LORD, we were like an untamed animal, but you taught us to obey. Bring us back; we are ready to return to you, the LORD our God. 
24Jr 31:19 We turned away from you, but soon we wanted to return. After you had punished us, we hung our heads in grief. We were ashamed and disgraced because we sinned when we were young.' 
24Jr 31:20 "Israel, you are my dearest child, the one I love best. Whenever I mention your name, I think of you with love. My heart goes out to you; I will be merciful. 
24Jr 31:21 Set up signs and mark the road; find again the way by which you left. Come back, people of Israel, come home to the towns you left. 
24Jr 31:22 How long will you hesitate, faithless people? I have created something new and different, as different as a woman protecting a man." 
24Jr 31:23 The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says, "When I restore the people to their land, they will once again say in the land of Judah and in its towns, 'May the LORD bless the sacred hill of Jerusalem, the holy place where he lives.' 
24Jr 31:24 People will live in Judah and in all its towns, and there will be farmers, and shepherds with their flocks. 
24Jr 31:25 I will refresh those who are weary and will satisfy with food everyone who is weak from hunger. 
24Jr 31:26 So then, people will say, 'I went to sleep and woke up refreshed.' 
24Jr 31:27 "I, the LORD, say that the time is coming when I will fill the land of Israel and Judah with people and animals. 
24Jr 31:28 And just as I took care to uproot, to pull down, to overthrow, to destroy, and to demolish them, so I will take care to plant them and to build them up. 
24Jr 31:29 When that time comes, people will no longer say, 'The parents ate the sour grapes, But the children got the sour taste.' 
24Jr 31:30 Instead, those who eat sour grapes will have their own teeth set on edge; and everyone will die because of their own sin." 
24Jr 31:31 The LORD says, "The time is coming when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and with the people of Judah. 
24Jr 31:32 It will not be like the old covenant that I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and led them out of Egypt. Although I was like a husband to them, they did not keep that covenant. 
24Jr 31:33 The new covenant that I will make with the people of Israel will be this�� I will put my law within them and write it on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
24Jr 31:34 None of them will have to teach a neighbor to know the LORD, because all will know me, from the least to the greatest. I will forgive their sins and I will no longer remember their wrongs. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 31:35 The LORD provides the sun for light by day, the moon and the stars to shine at night. He stirs up the sea and makes it roar; his name is the LORD Almighty. 
24Jr 31:36 He promises that as long as the natural order lasts, so long will Israel be a nation. 
24Jr 31:37 If one day the sky could be measured and the foundations of the earth explored, only then would he reject the people of Israel because of all they have done. The LORD has spoken. 
24Jr 31:38 "The time is coming," says the LORD, "when all of Jerusalem will be rebuilt as my city, from Hananel Tower west to the Corner Gate. 
24Jr 31:39 And the boundary line will continue from there on the west to the hill of Gareb and then around to Goah. 
24Jr 31:40 The entire valley, where the dead are buried and garbage is dumped, and all the fields above Kidron Brook as far as the Horse Gate to the east, will be sacred to me. The city will never again be torn down or destroyed." 
24Jr 32:1 The LORD spoke to me in the tenth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah, which was also the eighteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia. 
24Jr 32:2 At that time the army of the king of Babylonia was attacking Jerusalem, and I was locked up in the courtyard of the royal palace. 
24Jr 32:3 King Zedekiah had imprisoned me there and had accused me of announcing that the LORD had said, "I am going to let the king of Babylonia capture this city, 
24Jr 32:4 and King Zedekiah will not escape. He will be handed over to the king of Babylonia; he will see him face-to-face and will speak to him in person. 
24Jr 32:5 Zedekiah will be taken to Babylonia, and he will remain there until I deal with him. Even if he fights the Babylonians, he will not be successful. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 32:6 The LORD told me 
24Jr 32:7 that Hanamel, my uncle Shallum's son, would come to me with the request to buy his field at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin, because I was his nearest relative and had the right to buy it for myself. 
24Jr 32:8 Then, just as the LORD had said, Hanamel came to me there in the courtyard and asked me to buy the field. So I knew that the LORD had really spoken to me. 
24Jr 32:9 I bought the field from Hanamel and weighed out the money to him; the price came to seventeen pieces of silver. 
24Jr 32:10 I signed and sealed the deed, had it witnessed, and weighed out the money on scales. 
24Jr 32:11 Then I took both copies of the deed of purchase - the sealed copy containing the contract and its conditions, and the open copy - 
24Jr 32:12 and gave them to Baruch, the son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah. I gave them to him in the presence of Hanamel and of the witnesses who had signed the deed of purchase and of the people who were sitting in the courtyard. 
24Jr 32:13 Before them all I said to Baruch, 
24Jr 32:14 "The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, has ordered you to take these deeds, both the sealed deed of purchase and the open copy, and to place them in a clay jar, so that they may be preserved for years to come. 
24Jr 32:15 The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, has said that houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land." 
24Jr 32:16 After I had given the deed of purchase to Baruch, I prayed, 
24Jr 32:17 "Sovereign LORD, you made the earth and the sky by your great power and might; nothing is too difficult for you. 
24Jr 32:18 You have shown constant love to thousands, but you also punish people for the sins of their parents. You are a great and powerful God; you are the LORD Almighty. 
24Jr 32:19 You make wise plans and do mighty things; you see everything that people do, and you reward them according to their actions. 
24Jr 32:20 Long ago you performed miracles and wonders in Egypt, and you have continued to perform them to this day, both in Israel and among all the other nations, so that you are now known everywhere. 
24Jr 32:21 By means of miracles and wonders that terrified our enemies, you used your power and might to bring your people Israel out of Egypt. 
24Jr 32:22 You gave them this rich and fertile land, as you had promised their ancestors. 
24Jr 32:23 But when they came into this land and took possession of it, they did not obey your commands or live according to your teaching; they did nothing that you had ordered them to do. And so you brought all this destruction on them. 
24Jr 32:24 "The Babylonians have built siege mounds around the city to capture it, and they are attacking. War, starvation, and disease will make the city fall into their hands. You can see that all you have said has come true. 
24Jr 32:25 Yet, Sovereign LORD, you are the one who ordered me to buy the field in the presence of witnesses, even though the city is about to be captured by the Babylonians." 
24Jr 32:26 Then the LORD said to me, 
24Jr 32:27 "I am the LORD, the God of all people. Nothing is too difficult for me. 
24Jr 32:28 I am going to give this city over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his army; they will capture it 
24Jr 32:29 and set it on fire. They will burn it down, together with the houses where people have made me angry by burning incense to Baal on the rooftops and by pouring out wine offerings to other gods. 
24Jr 32:30 From the very beginning of their history the people of Israel and the people of Judah have displeased me and made me angry by what they have done. 
24Jr 32:31 The people of this city have made me angry and furious from the day it was built. I have decided to destroy it 
24Jr 32:32 because of all the evil that has been done by the people of Judah and Jerusalem, together with their kings and leaders, their priests and prophets. 
24Jr 32:33 They turned their backs on me; and though I kept on teaching them, they would not listen and learn. 
24Jr 32:34 They even placed their disgusting idols in the Temple built for my worship, and they have defiled it. 
24Jr 32:35 They have built altars to Baal in Hinnom Valley, to sacrifice their sons and daughters to the god Molech. I did not command them to do this, and it did not even enter my mind that they would do such a thing and make the people of Judah sin." 
24Jr 32:36 The LORD, the God of Israel, said to me, "Jeremiah, the people are saying that war, starvation, and disease will make this city fall into the hands of the king of Babylonia. Now listen to what else I have to say. 
24Jr 32:37 I am going to gather the people from all the countries where I have scattered them in my anger and fury, and I am going to bring them back to this place and let them live here in safety. 
24Jr 32:38 Then they will be my people, and I will be their God. 
24Jr 32:39 I will give them a single purpose in life�� to honor me for all time, for their own good and the good of their descendants. 
24Jr 32:40 I will make an eternal covenant with them. I will never stop doing good things for them, and I will make them fear me with all their heart, so that they will never turn away from me. 
24Jr 32:41 I will take pleasure in doing good things for them, and I will establish them permanently in this land. 
24Jr 32:42 "Just as I have brought this disaster on these people, so I am going to give them all the good things that I have promised. 
24Jr 32:43 The people are saying that this land will be like a desert where neither people nor animals live, and that it will be given over to the Babylonians. But fields will once again be bought in this land. 
24Jr 32:44 People will buy them, and the deeds will be signed, sealed, and witnessed. This will take place in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah, and in the towns in the hill country, in the foothills, and in southern Judah. I will restore the people to their land. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 33:1 While I was still in prison in the courtyard, the LORD's message came to me again. 
24Jr 33:2 The LORD, who made the earth, who formed it and set it in place, spoke to me. He whose name is the LORD said, 
24Jr 33:3 "Call to me, and I will answer you; I will tell you wonderful and marvelous things that you know nothing about. 
24Jr 33:4 I, the LORD, the God of Israel, say that the houses of Jerusalem and the royal palace of Judah will be torn down as a result of the siege and the attack. 
24Jr 33:5 Some will fight against the Babylonians, who will fill the houses with the corpses of those whom I am going to strike down in my anger and fury. I have turned away from this city because of the evil things that its people have done. 
24Jr 33:6 But I will heal this city and its people and restore them to health. I will show them abundant peace and security. 
24Jr 33:7 I will make Judah and Israel prosperous, and I will rebuild them as they were before. 
24Jr 33:8 I will purify them from the sins that they have committed against me, and I will forgive their sins and their rebellion. 
24Jr 33:9 Jerusalem will be a source of joy, honor, and pride to me; and every nation in the world will fear and tremble when they hear about the good things that I do for the people of Jerusalem and about the prosperity that I bring to the city." 
24Jr 33:10 The LORD said, "People are saying that this place is like a desert, that it has no people or animals living in it. And they are right; the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem are empty; no people or animals live there. But in these places you will hear again 
24Jr 33:11 the shouts of gladness and joy and the happy sounds of wedding feasts. You will hear people sing as they bring thank offerings to my Temple; they will say, 'Give thanks to the LORD Almighty, because he is good and his love is eternal.' I will make this land as prosperous as it was before. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 33:12 The LORD Almighty said, "In this land that is like a desert and where no people or animals live, there will once again be pastures where shepherds can take their sheep. 
24Jr 33:13 In the towns in the hill country, in the foothills, and in southern Judah, in the territory of Benjamin, in the villages around Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah, shepherds will once again count their sheep. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 33:14 The LORD said, "The time is coming when I will fulfill the promise that I made to the people of Israel and Judah. 
24Jr 33:15 At that time I will choose as king a righteous descendant of David. That king will do what is right and just throughout the land. 
24Jr 33:16 The people of Judah and of Jerusalem will be rescued and will live in safety. The city will be called 'The LORD Our Salvation.' 
24Jr 33:17 I, the LORD, promise that there will always be a descendant of David to be king of Israel 
24Jr 33:18 and that there will always be priests from the tribe of Levi to serve me and to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings, and sacrifices." 
24Jr 33:19 The LORD said to me, 
24Jr 33:20 "I have made a covenant with the day and with the night, so that they always come at their proper times; and that covenant can never be broken. 
24Jr 33:21 In the same way I have made a covenant with my servant David that he would always have a descendant to be king, and I have made a covenant with the priests from the tribe of Levi that they would always serve me; and those covenants can never be broken. 
24Jr 33:22 I will increase the number of descendants of my servant David and the number of priests from the tribe of Levi, so that it will be as impossible to count them as it is to count the stars in the sky or the grains of sand on the seashore." 
24Jr 33:23 The LORD said to me, 
24Jr 33:24 "Have you noticed how people are saying that I have rejected Israel and Judah, the two families that I chose? And so they look with contempt on my people and no longer consider them a nation. 
24Jr 33:25 But I, the LORD, have a covenant with day and night, and I have made the laws that control earth and sky. 
24Jr 33:26 And just as surely as I have done this, so I will maintain my covenant with Jacob's descendants and with my servant David. I will choose one of David's descendants to rule over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will be merciful to my people and make them prosperous again." 
24Jr 34:1 The LORD spoke to me when King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his army, supported by troops from all the nations and races that were subject to him, were attacking Jerusalem and its nearby towns. 
24Jr 34:2 The LORD, the God of Israel, told me to go and say to King Zedekiah of Judah, "I, the LORD, will hand this city over to the king of Babylonia, and he will burn it down. 
24Jr 34:3 You will not escape; you will be captured and handed over to him. You will see him face-to-face and talk to him in person; then you will go to Babylonia. 
24Jr 34:4 Zedekiah, listen to what I say about you. You will not be killed in battle. 
24Jr 34:5 You will die in peace, and as people burned incense when they buried your ancestors, who were kings before you, in the same way they will burn incense for you. They will mourn over you and say, 'Our king is dead!' I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 34:6 Then I gave this message to King Zedekiah in Jerusalem 
24Jr 34:7 while the army of the king of Babylonia was attacking the city. The army was also attacking Lachish and Azekah, the only other fortified cities left in Judah. 
24Jr 34:8 King Zedekiah and the people of Jerusalem had made an agreement to set free 
24Jr 34:9 their Hebrew slaves, both male and female, so that no one would have an Israelite as a slave. 
24Jr 34:10 All the people and their leaders agreed to free their slaves and never to enslave them again. They did set them free, 
24Jr 34:11 but later they changed their minds, took them back, and forced them to become slaves again. 
24Jr 34:12 Then the LORD, 
24Jr 34:13 the God of Israel, told me to say to the people�� "I made a covenant with your ancestors when I rescued them from Egypt and set them free from slavery. I told them that 
24Jr 34:14 every seven years they were to set free any Hebrew slave who had served them for six years. But your ancestors would not pay any attention to me or listen to what I said. 
24Jr 34:15 Just a few days ago you changed your minds and did what pleased me. All of you agreed to set all Israelites free, and you made a covenant in my presence, in the Temple where I am worshiped. 
24Jr 34:16 But then you changed your minds again and dishonored me. All of you took back the slaves whom you had set free as they desired, and you forced them into slavery again. 
24Jr 34:17 So now, I, the LORD, say that you have disobeyed me; you have not given all Israelites their freedom. Very well, then, I will give you freedom�� the freedom to die by war, disease, and starvation. I will make every nation in the world horrified at what I do to you. 
24Jr 34:18 The officials of Judah and of Jerusalem, together with the palace officials, the priests, and all the leaders, made a covenant with me by walking between the two halves of a bull that they had cut in two.
24Jr 34:19 But they broke the covenant and did not keep its terms. So I will do to these people what they did to the bull. 
24Jr 34:20 I will hand them over to their enemies, who want to kill them, and their corpses will be eaten by birds and wild animals. 
24Jr 34:21 I will also hand over King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials to those who want to kill them. I will hand them over to the Babylonian army, which has stopped its attack against you. 
24Jr 34:22 I will give the order, and they will return to this city. They will attack it, capture it, and burn it down. I will make the towns of Judah like a desert where no one lives. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 35:1 When Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the LORD said to me, 
24Jr 35:2 "Go to the members of the Rechabite clan and talk to them. Then bring them into one of the rooms in the Temple and offer them some wine." 
24Jr 35:3 So I took the entire Rechabite clan - Jaazaniah (the son of another Jeremiah, who was Habazziniah's son) and all his brothers and sons - 
24Jr 35:4 and brought them to the Temple. I took them into the room of the disciples of the prophet Hanan son of Igdaliah. This room was above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum, an important official in the Temple, and near the rooms of the other officials. 
24Jr 35:5 Then I placed cups and bowls full of wine before the Rechabites, and I said to them, "Have some wine." 
24Jr 35:6 But they answered, "We do not drink wine. Our ancestor Jonadab son of Rechab told us that neither we nor our descendants were ever to drink any wine. 
24Jr 35:7 He also told us not to build houses or farm the land and not to plant vineyards or buy them. He commanded us always to live in tents, so that we might remain in this land where we live like strangers. 
24Jr 35:8 We have obeyed all the instructions that Jonadab gave us. We ourselves never drink wine, and neither do our wives, our sons, or our daughters. 
24Jr 35:9 We do not build houses for homes - we live in tents - and we own no vineyards, fields, or grain.
24Jr 35:10 We have fully obeyed everything that our ancestor Jonadab commanded us. 
24Jr 35:11 But when King Nebuchadnezzar invaded the country, we decided to come to Jerusalem to get away from the Babylonian and Syrian armies. That is why we are living in Jerusalem." 
24Jr 35:12 Then the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, told me to go and say to the people of Judah and Jerusalem, 
24Jr 35:13 "I, the LORD, ask you why you refuse to listen to me and to obey my instructions. 
24Jr 35:14 Jonadab's descendants have obeyed his command not to drink wine, and to this very day none of them drink any. But I have kept on speaking to you, and you have not obeyed me. 
24Jr 35:15 I have continued to send you all my servants the prophets, and they have told you to give up your evil ways and to do what is right. They warned you not to worship and serve other gods, so that you could go on living in the land that I gave you and your ancestors. But you would not listen to me or pay any attention to me. 
24Jr 35:16 Jonadab's descendants have obeyed the command that their ancestor gave them, but you people have not obeyed me. 
24Jr 35:17 So now, I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, will bring on you people of Judah and of Jerusalem all the destruction that I promised. I will do this because you would not listen when I spoke to you, and you would not answer when I called you." 
24Jr 35:18 Then I told the Rechabite clan that the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, had said, "You have obeyed the command that your ancestor Jonadab gave you; you have followed all his instructions, and you have done everything he commanded you. 
24Jr 35:19 So I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, promise that Jonadab son of Rechab will always have a male descendant to serve me." 
24Jr 36:1 In the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, the LORD said to me, 
24Jr 36:2 "Get a scroll and write on it everything that I have told you about Israel and Judah and all the nations. Write everything that I have told you from the time I first spoke to you, when Josiah was king, up to the present. 
24Jr 36:3 Perhaps when the people of Judah hear about all the destruction that I intend to bring on them, they will turn from their evil ways. Then I will forgive their wickedness and their sins." 
24Jr 36:4 So I called Baruch son of Neriah and dictated to him everything that the LORD had said to me. And Baruch wrote it all down on a scroll. 
24Jr 36:5 Then I gave Baruch the following instructions�� "I am no longer allowed to go into the Temple. 
24Jr 36:6 But I want you to go there the next time the people are fasting. You are to read the scroll aloud, so that they will hear everything that the LORD has said to me and that I have dictated to you. Do this where everyone can hear you, including the people of Judah who have come in from their towns. 
24Jr 36:7 Perhaps they will pray to the LORD and turn from their evil ways, because the LORD has threatened this people with his terrible anger and fury." 
24Jr 36:8 So Baruch read the LORD's words in the Temple exactly as I had told him to do. 
24Jr 36:9 In the ninth month of the fifth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, the people fasted to gain the LORD's favor. The fast was kept by all who lived in Jerusalem and by all who came there from the towns of Judah. 
24Jr 36:10 Then, while all the people were listening, Baruch read from the scroll everything that I had said. He did this in the Temple, from the room of Gemariah son of Shaphan, the court secretary. His room was in the upper court near the entrance of the New Gate of the Temple. 
24Jr 36:11 Micaiah, the son of Gemariah and grandson of Shaphan, heard Baruch read from the scroll what the LORD had said. 
24Jr 36:12 Then he went to the royal palace, to the room of the court secretary, where all the officials were in session. Elishama, the court secretary, Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Achbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials were there. 
24Jr 36:13 Micaiah told them everything that he had heard Baruch read to the people. 
24Jr 36:14 Then the officials sent Jehudi (the son of Nethaniah, grandson of Shelemiah, and great-grandson of Cushi) to tell Baruch to bring the scroll that he had read to the people. Baruch brought them the scroll. 
24Jr 36:15 "Sit down," they said, "and read the scroll to us." So Baruch did. 
24Jr 36:16 After he had read it, they turned to one another in alarm and said to Baruch, "We must report this to the king." 
24Jr 36:17 Then they asked him, "Tell us, now, how did you come to write all this? Did Jeremiah dictate it to you?" 
24Jr 36:18 Baruch answered, "Jeremiah dictated every word of it to me, and I wrote it down in ink on this scroll." 
24Jr 36:19 Then they told him, "You and Jeremiah must go and hide. Don't let anyone know where you are." 
24Jr 36:20 The officials put the scroll in the room of Elishama, the court secretary, and went to the king's court, where they reported everything to the king. 
24Jr 36:21 Then the king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. He took it from the room of Elishama and read it to the king and all the officials who were standing around him. 
24Jr 36:22 It was winter and the king was sitting in his winter palace in front of the fire. 
24Jr 36:23 As soon as Jehudi finished reading three or four columns, the king cut them off with a small knife and threw them into the fire. He kept doing this until the entire scroll was burned up. 
24Jr 36:24 But neither the king nor any of his officials who heard all this was afraid or showed any sign of sorrow. 
24Jr 36:25 Although Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll, he paid no attention to them. 
24Jr 36:26 Then he ordered Prince Jerahmeel, together with Seraiah son of Azriel and Shelemiah son of Abdeel, to arrest me and my secretary Baruch. But the LORD had hidden us. 
24Jr 36:27 After King Jehoiakim had burned the scroll that I had dictated to Baruch, the LORD told me 
24Jr 36:28 to take another scroll and write on it everything that had been on the first one. 
24Jr 36:29 The LORD told me to say to the king, "You have burned the scroll, and you have asked Jeremiah why he wrote that the king of Babylonia would come and destroy this land and kill its people and its animals. 
24Jr 36:30 So now, I, the LORD, say to you, King Jehoiakim, that no descendant of yours will ever rule over David's kingdom. Your corpse will be thrown out where it will be exposed to the sun during the day and to the frost at night. 
24Jr 36:31 I will punish you, your descendants, and your officials because of the sins all of you commit. Neither you nor the people of Jerusalem and of Judah have paid any attention to my warnings, and so I will bring on all of you the disaster that I have threatened." 
24Jr 36:32 Then I took another scroll and gave it to my secretary Baruch, and he wrote down everything that I dictated. He wrote everything that had been on the first scroll and similar messages that I dictated to him. 
24Jr 37:1 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia made Zedekiah son of Josiah king of Judah in the place of Jehoiachin son of Jehoiakim. 
24Jr 37:2 But neither Zedekiah nor his officials nor the people obeyed the message which the LORD had given me. 
24Jr 37:3 King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah and the priest Zephaniah son of Maaseiah to ask me to pray to the LORD our God on behalf of our nation. 
24Jr 37:4 I had not yet been put in prison and was still moving about freely among the people. 
24Jr 37:5 The Babylonian army had been besieging Jerusalem, but when they heard that the Egyptian army had crossed the Egyptian border, they retreated. 
24Jr 37:6 Then the LORD, the God of Israel, told me 
24Jr 37:7 to say to Zedekiah, "The Egyptian army is on its way to help you, but it will return home. 
24Jr 37:8 Then the Babylonians will come back, attack the city, capture it, and burn it down. 
24Jr 37:9 I, the LORD, warn you not to deceive yourselves into thinking that the Babylonians will not come back, because they will. 
24Jr 37:10 Even if you defeat the whole Babylonian army, so that only wounded men are left, lying in their tents, they would still get up and burn this city to the ground." 
24Jr 37:11 The Babylonian army retreated from Jerusalem because the Egyptian army was approaching. 
24Jr 37:12 So I started to leave Jerusalem and go to the territory of Benjamin to take possession of my share of the family property. 
24Jr 37:13 But when I reached the Benjamin Gate, the officer in charge of the soldiers on duty there, a man by the name of Irijah, the son of Shelemiah and grandson of Hananiah, stopped me and said, "You are deserting to the Babylonians!" 
24Jr 37:14 I answered, "That's not so! I'm not deserting." But Irijah would not listen to me. Instead, he arrested me and took me to the officials. 
24Jr 37:15 They were furious with me and had me beaten and locked up in the house of Jonathan, the court secretary, whose house had been made into a prison. 
24Jr 37:16 I was put in an underground cell and kept there a long time. 
24Jr 37:17 Later on King Zedekiah sent for me, and there in the palace he asked me privately, "Is there any message from the LORD?" "There is," I answered, and added, "You will be handed over to the king of Babylonia." 
24Jr 37:18 Then I asked, "What crime have I committed against you or your officials or this people, to make you put me in prison? 
24Jr 37:19 What happened to your prophets who told you that the king of Babylonia would not attack you or the country? 
24Jr 37:20 And now, Your Majesty, I beg you to listen to me and do what I ask. Please do not send me back to the prison in Jonathan's house. If you do, I will surely die there." 
24Jr 37:21 So King Zedekiah ordered me to be locked up in the palace courtyard. I stayed there, and each day I was given a loaf of bread from the bakeries until all the bread in the city was gone. 
24Jr 38:1 Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malchiah heard that I was telling the people that 
24Jr 38:2 the LORD had said, "Whoever stays on in the city will die in war or of starvation or disease. But those who go out and surrender to the Babylonians will not be killed; they will at least escape with their life." 
24Jr 38:3 I was also telling them that the LORD had said, "I am going to give the city to the Babylonian army, and they will capture it." 
24Jr 38:4 Then the officials went to the king and said, "This man must be put to death. By talking like this he is making the soldiers in the city lose their courage, and he is doing the same thing to everyone else left in the city. He is not trying to help the people; he only wants to hurt them." 
24Jr 38:5 King Zedekiah answered, "Very well, then, do what you want to with him; I can't stop you." 
24Jr 38:6 So they took me and let me down by ropes into Prince Malchiah's well, which was in the palace courtyard. There was no water in the well, only mud, and I sank down in it. 
24Jr 38:7 However, Ebedmelech the Ethiopian, a eunuch who worked in the royal palace, heard that they had put me in the well. At that time the king was holding court at the Benjamin Gate. 
24Jr 38:8 So Ebedmelech went there and said to the king, 
24Jr 38:9 "Your Majesty, what these men have done is wrong. They have put Jeremiah in the well, where he is sure to die of starvation, since there is no more food in the city." 
24Jr 38:10 Then the king ordered Ebedmelech to take with him three men and to pull me out of the well before I died. 
24Jr 38:11 So Ebedmelech went with the men to the palace storeroom and got some worn-out clothing which he let down to me by ropes. 
24Jr 38:12 He told me to put the rags under my arms, so that the ropes wouldn't hurt me. I did this, 
24Jr 38:13 and they pulled me up out of the well. After that I was kept in the courtyard. 
24Jr 38:14 On another occasion King Zedekiah had me brought to him at the third entrance to the Temple, and he said, "I am going to ask you a question, and I want you to tell me the whole truth." 
24Jr 38:15 I answered, "If I tell you the truth, you will put me to death, and if I give you advice, you won't pay any attention." 
24Jr 38:16 So King Zedekiah promised me in secret, "I swear by the living God, the God who gave us life, that I will not put you to death or hand you over to the men who want to kill you." 
24Jr 38:17 Then I told Zedekiah that the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, had said, "If you surrender to the king of Babylonia's officers, your life will be spared, and this city will not be burned down. Both you and your family will be spared. 
24Jr 38:18 But if you do not surrender, then this city will be handed over to the Babylonians, who will burn it down, and you will not escape from them." 
24Jr 38:19 But the king answered, "I am afraid of our own people who have deserted to the Babylonians. I may be handed over to them and tortured." 
24Jr 38:20 I said, "You will not be handed over to them. I beg you to obey the LORD's message; then all will go well with you, and your life will be spared. 
24Jr 38:21 But the LORD has shown me in a vision what will happen if you refuse to surrender. 
24Jr 38:22 In it I saw all the women left in Judah's royal palace being led out to the king of Babylonia's officers. Listen to what they were saying as they went�� 'The king's best friends misled him, they overruled him. And now that his feet have sunk in the mud, his friends have left him.' " 
24Jr 38:23 Then I added, "All your women and children will be taken out to the Babylonians, and you yourself will not escape from them. You will be taken prisoner by the king of Babylonia, and this city will be burned to the ground." 
24Jr 38:24 Zedekiah replied, "Don't let anyone know about this conversation, and your life will not be in danger. 
24Jr 38:25 If the officials hear that I have talked with you, they will come and ask you what we said. They will promise not to put you to death if you tell them everything. 
24Jr 38:26 Just tell them you were begging me not to send you back to prison to die there." 
24Jr 38:27 Then all the officials came and questioned me, and I told them exactly what the king had told me to say. There was nothing else they could do, because no one had overheard the conversation. 
24Jr 38:28 And I was kept in the palace courtyard until the day Jerusalem was captured. 
24Jr 39:1 In the tenth month of the ninth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia came with his whole army and attacked Jerusalem. 
24Jr 39:2 On the ninth day of the fourth month of Zedekiah's eleventh year as king, the city walls were broken through. 
24Jr 39:3 (When Jerusalem was captured, all the high officials of the king of Babylonia came and took their places at the Middle Gate, including Nergal Sharezer, Samgar Nebo, Sarsechim, and another Nergal Sharezer. ) 
24Jr 39:4 When King Zedekiah and all his soldiers saw what was happening, they tried to escape from the city during the night. They left by way of the royal garden, went through the gateway connecting the two walls, and escaped in the direction of the Jordan Valley. 
24Jr 39:5 But the Babylonian army pursued them and captured Zedekiah in the plains near Jericho. Then they took him to King Nebuchadnezzar, who was in the city of Riblah in the territory of Hamath, and there Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him. 
24Jr 39:6 At Riblah he put Zedekiah's sons to death while Zedekiah was looking on, and he also had the officials of Judah executed. 
24Jr 39:7 After that, he had Zedekiah's eyes put out and had him placed in chains to be taken to Babylonia. 
24Jr 39:8 Meanwhile, the Babylonians burned down the royal palace and the houses of the people and tore down the walls of Jerusalem. 
24Jr 39:9 Finally Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, took away as prisoners to Babylonia the people who were left in the city, together with those who had deserted to him. 
24Jr 39:10 He left in the land of Judah some of the poorest people, who owned no property, and he gave them vineyards and fields. 
24Jr 39:11 But King Nebuchadnezzar commanded Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, to give the following order�� 
24Jr 39:12 "Go and find Jeremiah and take good care of him. Do not harm him, but do for him whatever he wants." 
24Jr 39:13 So Nebuzaradan, together with the high officials Nebushazban and Nergal Sharezer and all the other officers of the king of Babylonia, 
24Jr 39:14 had me brought from the palace courtyard. They put me under the care of Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, who was to see that I got home safely. And so I stayed there among the people. 
24Jr 39:15 While I was still imprisoned in the palace courtyard, the LORD told me 
24Jr 39:16 to tell Ebedmelech the Ethiopian that the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, had said, "Just as I said I would, I am going to bring upon this city destruction and not prosperity. And when this happens, you will be there to see it. 
24Jr 39:17 But I, the LORD, will protect you, and you will not be handed over to the people you are afraid of. 
24Jr 39:18 I will keep you safe, and you will not be put to death. You will escape with your life because you have put your trust in me. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 40:1 The LORD spoke to me after Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, had set me free at Ramah. I had been taken there in chains, along with all the other people from Jerusalem and Judah who were being taken away as prisoners to Babylonia. 
24Jr 40:2 The commanding officer took me aside and said, "The LORD your God threatened this land with destruction, 
24Jr 40:3 and now he has done what he said he would. All this happened because your people sinned against the LORD and disobeyed him. 
24Jr 40:4 Now, I am taking the chains off your wrists and setting you free. If you want to go to Babylonia with me, you may do so, and I will take care of you. But if you don't want to go, you don't have to. You have the whole country to choose from, and you may go wherever you wish." 
24Jr 40:5 When I did not answer, Nebuzaradan said, "Go back to Gedaliah, the son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, whom the king of Babylonia has made governor of the towns of Judah. You may stay with him and live among the people, or you may go anywhere you think you should." Then he gave me a present and some food to take with me, and let me go on my way. 
24Jr 40:6 I went to stay with Gedaliah in Mizpah and lived among the people who were left in the land. 
24Jr 40:7 Some of the Judean officers and soldiers had not surrendered. They heard that the king of Babylonia had made Gedaliah governor of the land and had placed him in charge of all those who had not been taken away to Babylonia - the poorest people in the land. 
24Jr 40:8 So Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai from Netophah, and Jezaniah from Maacah went with their men to Gedaliah at Mizpah. 
24Jr 40:9 Gedaliah said to them, "I give you my word that there is no need for you to be afraid to surrender to the Babylonians. Settle in this land, serve the king of Babylonia, and all will go well with you. 
24Jr 40:10 I myself will stay in Mizpah and be your representative when the Babylonians come here. But you can gather and store up wine, fruit, and olive oil, and live in the villages you occupy." 
24Jr 40:11 Meanwhile, all the Israelites who were in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and other countries, heard that the king of Babylonia had allowed some Israelites to stay on in Judah and that he had made Gedaliah their governor. 
24Jr 40:12 So they left the places where they had been scattered, and returned to Judah. They came to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and there they gathered in large amounts of wine and fruit. 
24Jr 40:13 After this, Johanan and the leaders of the soldiers who had not surrendered came to Gedaliah at Mizpah 
24Jr 40:14 and said to him, "Don't you know that King Baalis of Ammon has sent Ishmael to murder you?" But Gedaliah did not believe it. 
24Jr 40:15 Then Johanan said privately to him, "Let me go and kill Ishmael, and no one will know who did it. Why should he be allowed to murder you? That would cause all the Jews who have gathered around you to be scattered, and it would bring disaster on all the people who are left in Judah." 
24Jr 40:16 But Gedaliah answered, "Don't do it! What you are saying about Ishmael is not true!" 
24Jr 41:1 In the seventh month of that year, Ishmael, the son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama, a member of the royal family and one of the king's chief officers, went to Mizpah with ten men to see Governor Gedaliah. While they were all eating a meal together, 
24Jr 41:2 Ishmael and the ten men with him pulled out their swords and killed Gedaliah. 
24Jr 41:3 Ishmael also killed all the Israelites who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah and the Babylonian soldiers who happened to be there. 
24Jr 41:4 The next day, before anyone knew about Gedaliah's murder, 
24Jr 41:5 eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria. They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and gashed themselves. They were taking grain and incense to offer in the Temple. 
24Jr 41:6 So Ishmael went out from Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he came to them, he said, "Please come in to see Gedaliah." 
24Jr 41:7 As soon as they were inside the city, Ishmael and his men killed them and threw their bodies in a well. 
24Jr 41:8 But there were ten men in the group who said to Ishmael, "Please don't kill us! We have wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey hidden in the fields." So he spared them. 
24Jr 41:9 The well into which Ishmael threw the bodies of the men he had killed was the large one that King Asa had dug when he was being attacked by King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael filled the well with the bodies. 
24Jr 41:10 Then he made prisoners of the king's daughters and all the rest of the people in Mizpah, whom Nebuzaradan the commanding officer had placed under the care of Gedaliah. Ishmael took them prisoner and started off in the direction of the territory of Ammon. 
24Jr 41:11 Johanan and all the army leaders with him heard of the crime that Ishmael had committed. 
24Jr 41:12 So they went after him with their men and overtook him near the large pool at Gibeon. 
24Jr 41:13 When Ishmael's prisoners saw Johanan and the leaders of the forces with him, they were glad, 
24Jr 41:14 and turned and ran to them. 
24Jr 41:15 But Ishmael and eight of his men got away from Johanan and escaped to the land of Ammon. 
24Jr 41:16 Then Johanan and the leaders of the forces with him took charge of the people whom Ishmael had taken away as prisoners from Mizpah after murdering Gedaliah - soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs. 
24Jr 41:17 They were afraid of the Babylonians because Ishmael had murdered Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylonia had made governor of the land. 
24Jr 41:18 So they set out for Egypt, in order to get away from the Babylonians. On the way they stopped at Chimham near Bethlehem. 
24Jr 42:1 Then all the army leaders, including Johanan son of Kareah and Azariah son of Hoshaiah, came with people of every class 
24Jr 42:2 and said to me, "Please do what we ask you! Pray to the LORD our God for us. Pray for all of us who have survived. Once there were many of us; but now only a few of us are left, as you can see. 
24Jr 42:3 Pray that the LORD our God will show us the way we should go and what we should do." 
24Jr 42:4 I answered, "Very well, then. I will pray to the LORD our God, just as you have asked, and whatever he says, I will tell you. I will not keep back anything from you." 
24Jr 42:5 Then they said to me, "May the LORD be a true and faithful witness against us if we do not obey all the commands that the LORD our God gives you for us. 
24Jr 42:6 Whether it pleases us or not, we will obey the LORD our God, to whom we are asking you to pray. All will go well with us if we obey him." 
24Jr 42:7 Ten days later the LORD spoke to me; 
24Jr 42:8 so I called together Johanan, all the army leaders who were with him, and all the other people. 
24Jr 42:9 I said to them, "The LORD, the God of Israel, to whom you sent me with your request has said, 
24Jr 42:10 'If you are willing to go on living in this land, then I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not pull you up. The destruction I brought on you has caused me great sorrow. 
24Jr 42:11 Stop being afraid of the king of Babylonia. I am with you, and I will rescue you from his power. 
24Jr 42:12 Because I am merciful, I will make him have mercy on you and let you go back home. I, the LORD, have spoken.' 
24Jr 42:13 "But you people who are left in Judah must not disobey the LORD your God and refuse to live in this land. 
24Jr 42:14 You must not say, 'No, we will go and live in Egypt, where we won't face war any more or hear the call to battle or go hungry.' 
24Jr 42:15 If you say this, then the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says, 'If you are determined to go and live in Egypt, 
24Jr 42:16 then the war that you fear will overtake you, and the hunger you dread will follow you, and you will die there in Egypt. 
24Jr 42:17 All the people who are determined to go and live in Egypt will die either in war or of starvation or disease. Not one of them will survive, not one will escape the disaster that I am going to bring on them.' 
24Jr 42:18 "The LORD, the God of Israel, says, 'Just as my anger and fury were poured out on the people of Jerusalem, so my fury will be poured out on you if you go to Egypt. You will be a horrifying sight; people will make fun of you and use your name as a curse. You will never see this place again.' " 
24Jr 42:19 Then I continued, "The LORD has told you people who are left in Judah not to go to Egypt. And so I warn you now 
24Jr 42:20 that you are making a fatal mistake. You asked me to pray to the LORD our God for you, and you promised that you would do everything that he commands. 
24Jr 42:21 And now I have told you, but you are disobeying everything that the LORD our God sent me to tell you. 
24Jr 42:22 So then, remember this�� you will die in war or of starvation or disease in the land where you want to go and live." 
24Jr 43:1 I finished telling the people everything that the LORD their God had sent me to tell them. 
24Jr 43:2 Then Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other arrogant men said to me, "You are lying. The LORD our God did not send you to tell us not to go and live in Egypt. 
24Jr 43:3 Baruch son of Neriah has stirred you up against us, so that the Babylonians will gain power over us and can either kill us or take us away to Babylonia." 
24Jr 43:4 So neither Johanan nor any of the army officers nor any of the people would obey the LORD's command to remain in the land of Judah. 
24Jr 43:5 Then Johanan and all the army officers took everybody left in Judah away to Egypt, together with all the people who had returned from the nations where they had been scattered�� 
24Jr 43:6 the men, the women, the children, and the king's daughters. They took everyone whom Nebuzaradan the commanding officer had left under the care of Gedaliah, including Baruch and me. 
24Jr 43:7 They disobeyed the LORD's command and went into Egypt as far as the city of Tahpanhes. 
24Jr 43:8 There the LORD said to me, 
24Jr 43:9 "Get some large stones and bury them in the mortar of the pavement in front of the entrance to the government building here in the city, and let some of the Israelites see you do it. 
24Jr 43:10 Then tell them that I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, am going to bring my servant King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia to this place, and he will put his throne over these stones that you buried, and will spread the royal tent over them. 
24Jr 43:11 Nebuchadnezzar will come and defeat Egypt. Those people who are doomed to die of disease will die of disease, those doomed to be taken away as prisoners will be taken away as prisoners, and those doomed to be killed in war will be killed in war. 
24Jr 43:12 I will set fire to the temples of Egypt's gods, and the king of Babylonia will either burn their gods or carry them off. As shepherds pick their clothes clean of lice, so the king of Babylonia will pick the land of Egypt clean and then leave victorious. 
24Jr 43:13 He will destroy the sacred stone monuments at Heliopolis in Egypt and will burn down the temples of the Egyptian gods." 
24Jr 44:1 The LORD spoke to me concerning all the Israelites living in Egypt, in the cities of Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis, and in the southern part of the country. 
24Jr 44:2 The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, said, "You yourselves have seen the destruction I brought on Jerusalem and all the other cities of Judah. Even now they are still in ruins, and no one lives in them 
24Jr 44:3 because their people had done evil and had made me angry. They offered sacrifices to other gods and served gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors ever worshiped. 
24Jr 44:4 I kept sending you my servants the prophets, who told you not to do this terrible thing that I hate. 
24Jr 44:5 But you would not listen or pay any attention. You would not give up your evil practice of sacrificing to other gods. 
24Jr 44:6 So I poured out my anger and fury on the towns of Judah and on the streets of Jerusalem, and I set them on fire. They were left in ruins and became a horrifying sight, as they are today. 
24Jr 44:7 "And so I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, now ask why you are doing such an evil thing to yourselves. Do you want to bring destruction on men and women, children and babies, so that none of your people will be left? 
24Jr 44:8 Why do you make me angry by worshiping idols and by sacrificing to other gods here in Egypt, where you have come to live? Are you doing this just to destroy yourselves, so that every nation on earth will make fun of you and use your name as a curse? 
24Jr 44:9 Have you forgotten all the wicked things that have been done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem by your ancestors, by the kings of Judah and their wives, and by you and your wives? 
24Jr 44:10 But to this day you have not humbled yourselves. You have not honored me or lived according to all the laws that I gave you and your ancestors. 
24Jr 44:11 "So then, I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, will turn against you and destroy all Judah. 
24Jr 44:12 As for the people of Judah who are left and are determined to go and live in Egypt, I will see to it that all of them are destroyed. All of them, great and small, will die in Egypt, either in war or of starvation. They will be a horrifying sight; people will make fun of them and use their name as a curse. 
24Jr 44:13 I will punish those who live in Egypt, just as I punished Jerusalem - with war, starvation, and disease. 
24Jr 44:14 None of the people of Judah who are left and have come to Egypt to live will escape or survive. Not one of them will return to Judah, where they long to live once again. No one will return except a few refugees." 
24Jr 44:15 Then all the men who knew that their wives offered sacrifices to other gods, and all the women who were standing there, including the Israelites who lived in southern Egypt - a large crowd in all - said to me, 
24Jr 44:16 "We refuse to listen to what you have told us in the name of the LORD. 
24Jr 44:17 We will do everything that we said we would. We will offer sacrifices to our goddess, the Queen of Heaven, and we will pour out wine offerings to her, just as we and our ancestors, our king and our leaders, used to do in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. Then we had plenty of food, we were prosperous, and had no troubles. 
24Jr 44:18 But ever since we stopped sacrificing to the Queen of Heaven and stopped pouring out wine offerings to her, we have had nothing, and our people have died in war and of starvation." 
24Jr 44:19 And the women added, "When we baked cakes shaped like the Queen of Heaven, offered sacrifices to her, and poured out wine offerings to her, our husbands approved of what we were doing." 
24Jr 44:20 Then I said to all the men and the women who had answered me in this way, 
24Jr 44:21 "As for the sacrifices which you and your ancestors, your kings and your leaders, and the people of the land offered in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem - do you think that the LORD did not know about them or that he forgot them? 
24Jr 44:22 This very day your land lies in ruins and no one lives in it. It has become a horrifying sight, and people use its name as a curse because the LORD could no longer endure your wicked and evil practices. 
24Jr 44:23 This present disaster has come on you because you offered sacrifices to other gods and sinned against the LORD by not obeying all his commands." 
24Jr 44:24 I told all the people, especially the women, what the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, was saying to the people of Judah living in Egypt�� "Both you and your wives have made solemn promises to the Queen of Heaven. 
24Jr 44:25 You promised that you would offer sacrifices to her and pour out wine offerings to her, and you have kept your promises. Very well, then! Keep your promises! Carry out your vows! 
24Jr 44:26 But now listen to the vow that I, the LORD, have made in my mighty name to all you Israelites in Egypt�� Never again will I let any of you use my name to make a vow by saying, 'I swear by the living Sovereign LORD!' 
24Jr 44:27 I will see to it that you will not prosper, but will be destroyed. All of you will die, either in war or of disease, until not one of you is left. 
24Jr 44:28 But a few of you will escape death and return from Egypt to Judah. Then the survivors will know whose words have come true, mine or theirs. 
24Jr 44:29 I, the LORD, will give you proof that I will punish you in this place and that my promise to bring destruction on you will come true. 
24Jr 44:30 I will hand over King Hophra of Egypt to his enemies who want to kill him, just as I handed over King Zedekiah of Judah to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, who was his enemy and wanted to kill him." 
24Jr 45:1 In the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah, Baruch wrote down what I had dictated to him. Then I told him 
24Jr 45:2 that the LORD, the God of Israel, had said, "Baruch, 
24Jr 45:3 you are saying, 'I give up! The LORD has added sorrow to my troubles. I am worn out from groaning, and I can't find any rest!' 
24Jr 45:4 "But I, the LORD, am tearing down what I have built and pulling up what I have planted. I will do this to the entire earth. 
24Jr 45:5 Are you looking for special treatment for yourself ? Don't do it. I am bringing disaster on all people, but you will at least escape with your life, wherever you go. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 46:1 The LORD spoke to me about the nations, 
24Jr 46:2 beginning with Egypt. This is what he said about the army of King Neco of Egypt, which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia defeated at Carchemish near the Euphrates River in the fourth year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah�� 
24Jr 46:3 "The Egyptian officers shout, 'Get your shields ready and march into battle! 
24Jr 46:4 Harness your horses and mount them! Fall in line and put on your helmets! Sharpen your spears! Put on your armor!' 
24Jr 46:5 "But what do I see?" asks the LORD. "They are turning back in terror. Their soldiers are beaten back; overcome with fear, they run as fast as they can and do not look back. 
24Jr 46:6 Those who run fast cannot get away; the soldiers cannot escape. In the north, by the Euphrates, they stumble and fall. 
24Jr 46:7 Who is this that rises like the Nile, like a river flooding its banks? 
24Jr 46:8 It is Egypt, rising like the Nile, like a river flooding its banks. Egypt said, 'I will rise and cover the world; I will destroy cities and the people who live there. 
24Jr 46:9 Command the horses to go and the chariots to roll! Send out the soldiers�� men from Ethiopia and Libya, carrying shields, and skilled archers from Lydia.' " 
24Jr 46:10 This is the day of the Sovereign LORD Almighty�� today he will take revenge; today he will punish his enemies. His sword will eat them until it is full, and drink their blood until it is satisfied. Today the Almighty sacrifices his victims in the north, by the Euphrates. 
24Jr 46:11 People of Egypt, go to Gilead and look for medicine! All your medicine has proved useless; nothing can heal you. 
24Jr 46:12 Nations have heard of your shame; everyone has heard you cry. One soldier trips over another, and both of them fall to the ground. 
24Jr 46:13 When King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia came to attack Egypt, the LORD spoke to me. He said, 
24Jr 46:14 "Proclaim it in the towns of Egypt, in Migdol, Memphis, and Tahpanhes�� 'Get ready to defend yourselves; all you have will be destroyed in war! 
24Jr 46:15 Why has your mighty god Apis fallen? The LORD has struck him down!' 
24Jr 46:16 Your soldiers have stumbled and fallen; each one says to the other, 'Hurry! Let's go home to our people and escape the enemy's sword!' 
24Jr 46:17 "Give the king of Egypt a new name - 'Noisy Braggart Who Missed His Chance.' 
24Jr 46:18 I, the LORD Almighty, am king. I am the living God. As Mount Tabor towers above the mountains and Mount Carmel stands high above the sea, so will be the strength of the one who attacks you. 
24Jr 46:19 Get ready to be taken prisoner, you people of Egypt! Memphis will be made a desert, a ruin where no one lives. 
24Jr 46:20 Egypt is like a splendid cow, attacked by a stinging fly from the north. 
24Jr 46:21 Even her hired soldiers are helpless as calves. They did not stand and fight; all of them turned and ran. The day of their doom had arrived, the time of their destruction. 
24Jr 46:22 Egypt runs away, hissing like a snake, as the enemy's army approaches. They attack her with axes, like people cutting down trees 
24Jr 46:23 and destroying a thick forest. Their soldiers are too many to count; they outnumber the locusts. 
24Jr 46:24 The people of Egypt are put to shame; they are conquered by the people of the north. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 46:25 The LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, says, "I am going to punish Amon, the god of Thebes, together with Egypt and its gods and kings. I am going to take the king of Egypt and all who put their trust in him, 
24Jr 46:26 and hand them over to those who want to kill them, to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia and his army. But later on, people will live in Egypt again, as they did in times past. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 46:27 "My people, do not be afraid, people of Israel, do not be terrified. I will rescue you from that faraway land, from the land where you are prisoners. You will come back home and live in peace; you will be secure, and no one will make you afraid. 
24Jr 46:28 I will come to you and save you. I will destroy all the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not destroy you. I will not let you go unpunished; but when I punish you, I will be fair. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 47:1 Before the king of Egypt attacked Gaza, the LORD spoke to me about Philistia. 
24Jr 47:2 He said�� "Look! Waters are rising in the north and will rush like a river in flood. They will cover the land and everything on it, cities and the people who live there. People will call out for help; everyone on earth will cry bitterly. 
24Jr 47:3 They will hear the hoofbeats of horses, the clatter of chariots, the rumble of wheels. Parents will not turn back for their children; their hands will hang limp at their sides. 
24Jr 47:4 The time has come to destroy Philistia, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon all the help that remains. I, the LORD, will destroy the Philistines, all who came from the shores of Crete. 
24Jr 47:5 Great sorrow has come to the people of Gaza, and Ashkelon's people are silent. How long will the rest of Philistia mourn? 
24Jr 47:6 You cry out, 'Sword of the LORD! How long will you go on slashing? Go back to your scabbard, stay there and rest!' 
24Jr 47:7 But how can it rest, when I have given it work to do? I have commanded it to attack Ashkelon and the people who live on the coast." 
24Jr 48:1 This is what the LORD Almighty said about Moab�� "Pity the people of Nebo - their town is destroyed! Kiriathaim is captured, its mighty fortress torn down, and its people put to shame; 
24Jr 48:2 the splendor of Moab is gone. The enemy have captured Heshbon and plot to destroy the nation of Moab. The town of Madmen will be silenced; armies will march against it. 
24Jr 48:3 The people of Horonaim cry out, 'Violence! Destruction!' 
24Jr 48:4 "Moab has been destroyed; listen to the children crying. 
24Jr 48:5 Hear the sound of their sobs along the road up to Luhith, the cries of distress on the way down to Horonaim. 
24Jr 48:6 'Quick, run for your lives!' they say. 'Run like a wild desert donkey!' 
24Jr 48:7 "Moab, you trusted in your strength and your wealth, but now even you will be conquered; your god Chemosh will go into exile, along with his princes and priests. 
24Jr 48:8 Not a town will escape the destruction; both valley and plain will be ruined. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 48:9 Set up a tombstone for Moab; it will soon be destroyed. Its towns will be left in ruins, and no one will live there again." 
24Jr 48:10 (Curse those who do not do the LORD's work with all their heart! Curse those who do not slash and kill!) 
24Jr 48:11 The LORD said, "Moab has always lived secure and has never been taken into exile. Moab is like wine left to settle undisturbed and never poured from jar to jar. Its flavor has never been ruined, and it tastes as good as ever. 
24Jr 48:12 "So now, the time is coming when I will send people to pour Moab out like wine. They will empty its wine jars and break them in pieces. 
24Jr 48:13 Then the Moabites will be disillusioned with their god Chemosh, just as the Israelites were disillusioned with Bethel, a god in whom they trusted. 
24Jr 48:14 "Men of Moab, why do you claim to be heroes, brave soldiers tested in war? 
24Jr 48:15 Moab and its cities are destroyed; its finest young men have been slaughtered. I am the king, the LORD Almighty, and I have spoken. 
24Jr 48:16 Moab's doom approaches; its ruin is coming soon. 
24Jr 48:17 "Mourn for that nation, you that live nearby, all of you that know its fame. Say, 'Its powerful rule has been broken; its glory and might are no more.' 
24Jr 48:18 You that live in Dibon, come down from your place of honor and sit on the ground in the dust; Moab's destroyer is here and has left its forts in ruins. 
24Jr 48:19 You that live in Aroer, stand by the road and wait; ask those who are running away, find out from them what has happened. 
24Jr 48:20 'Moab has fallen,' they will answer, 'weep for it; it is disgraced. Announce along the Arnon River that Moab is destroyed!' 
24Jr 48:21 "Judgment has come on the cities of the plateau�� on Holon, Jahzah, Mephaath, 
24Jr 48:22 Dibon, Nebo, Beth Diblathaim, 
24Jr 48:23 Kiriathaim, Bethgamul, Bethmeon, 
24Jr 48:24 Kerioth, and Bozrah. Judgment has come on all the cities of Moab, far and near. 
24Jr 48:25 Moab's might has been crushed; its power has been destroyed. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 48:26 The LORD said, "Make Moab drunk, because it has rebelled against me. Moab will roll in its own vomit, and people will laugh. 
24Jr 48:27 Moab, remember how you made fun of the people of Israel? You treated them as though they had been caught with a gang of robbers. 
24Jr 48:28 "You people who live in Moab, leave your towns! Go and live on the cliffs! Be like the dove that makes its nest in the sides of a ravine. 
24Jr 48:29 Moab is very proud! I have heard how proud, arrogant, and conceited the people are, how much they think of themselves. 
24Jr 48:30 I, the LORD, know of their arrogance. Their boasts amount to nothing, and the things they do will not last. 
24Jr 48:31 And so I will weep for everyone in Moab and for the people of Kir Heres. 
24Jr 48:32 I will cry for the people of Sibmah, even more than for the people of Jazer. City of Sibmah, you are like a vine whose branches reach across the Dead Sea and go as far as Jazer. But now your summer fruits and your grapes have been destroyed. 
24Jr 48:33 Happiness and joy have been taken away from the fertile land of Moab. I have made the wine stop flowing from the wine presses; there is no one to make the wine and shout for joy. 
24Jr 48:34 "The people of Heshbon and Elealeh cry out, and their cry can be heard as far as Jahaz; it can be heard by the people in Zoar, and it is heard as far as Horonaim and Eglath Shelishiyah. Even Nimrim Brook has dried up. 
24Jr 48:35 I will stop the people of Moab from making burnt offerings at their places of worship and from offering sacrifices to their gods. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 48:36 "So my heart mourns for Moab and for the people of Kir Heres, like someone playing a funeral song on a flute, because everything they owned is gone. 
24Jr 48:37 All of them have shaved their heads and cut off their beards. They have all made gashes on their hands, and everyone is wearing sackcloth. 
24Jr 48:38 On all the housetops of Moab and in all its public squares there is nothing but mourning, because I have broken Moab like a jar that no one wants. 
24Jr 48:39 Moab has been shattered! Cry out! Moab has been disgraced. It is in ruins, and all the surrounding nations make fun of it. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 48:40 The LORD has promised that a nation will swoop down on Moab like an eagle with its outspread wings, 
24Jr 48:41 and the towns and fortresses will be captured. On that day Moab's soldiers will be as frightened as a woman in labor. 
24Jr 48:42 Moab will be destroyed and will no longer be a nation, because it rebelled against me. 
24Jr 48:43 Terror, pits, and traps are waiting for the people of Moab. The LORD has spoken. 
24Jr 48:44 Whoever tries to escape the terror will fall into the pits, and whoever climbs out of the pits will be caught in the traps, because the LORD has set the time for Moab's destruction. 
24Jr 48:45 Helpless refugees try to find protection in Heshbon, the city that King Sihon once ruled, but it is in flames. Fire has burned up the frontiers and the mountain heights of the war-loving people of Moab. 
24Jr 48:46 Pity the people of Moab! The people who worshiped Chemosh have been destroyed, and their sons and daughters have been taken away as prisoners. 
24Jr 48:47 But in days to come the LORD will make Moab prosperous again. All of this is what the LORD has said will happen to Moab. 
24Jr 49:1 This is what the LORD said about Ammon�� "Where are the men of Israel? Is there no one to defend their land? Why have they let the people who worship Molech take the territory of the tribe of Gad and settle there? 
24Jr 49:2 But the time is coming when I will make the people of the capital city of Rabbah hear the noise of battle, and it will be left in ruins and its villages burned to the ground. Then Israel will take its land back from those who took it from them. 
24Jr 49:3 People of Heshbon, cry out! Ai is destroyed! Women of Rabbah, go into mourning! Put on sackcloth and mourn. Run about in confusion. Your god Molech will be taken into exile, together with his priests and princes. 
24Jr 49:4 Why do you unfaithful people boast? Your strength is failing. Why do you trust in your power and say that no one would dare attack you? 
24Jr 49:5 I will bring terror on you from every side. You will all run away. Each one will run for his life, and there will be no one to bring your troops together again. 
24Jr 49:6 "But later on I will make Ammon prosperous again. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 49:7 This is what the LORD Almighty said about Edom�� "Have the people of Edom lost their good judgment? Can their advisers no longer tell them what to do? Has all their wisdom disappeared? 
24Jr 49:8 People of Dedan, turn and run! Hide! I am going to destroy Esau's descendants because the time has come for me to punish them. 
24Jr 49:9 When people pick grapes, they leave a few on the vines, and when robbers come at night, they take only what they want. 
24Jr 49:10 But I have stripped Esau's descendants completely and uncovered their hiding places, so that they can no longer hide. All the people of Edom are destroyed. Not one of them is left. 
24Jr 49:11 Leave your orphans with me, and I will take care of them. Your widows can depend on me. 
24Jr 49:12 "If even those who did not deserve to be punished had to drink from the cup of punishment, do you think that you will go unpunished? No, you must drink from the cup! 
24Jr 49:13 I myself have sworn that the city of Bozrah will become a horrifying sight and a desert; people will make fun of it and use its name as a curse. All the nearby villages will be in ruins forever. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 49:14 I said, "Edom, I have received a message from the LORD. He has sent a messenger to tell the nations to assemble their armies and to get ready to attack you. 
24Jr 49:15 The LORD is going to make you weak, and no one will respect you. 
24Jr 49:16 Your pride has deceived you. No one fears you as much as you think they do. You live on the rocky cliffs, high on top of the mountain; but even though you live as high up as an eagle, the LORD will bring you down. The LORD has spoken." 
24Jr 49:17 The LORD said, "The destruction that will come on Edom will be so terrible that everyone who passes by will be shocked and terrified. 
24Jr 49:18 The same thing will happen to Edom that happened to Sodom and Gomorrah, when they and the nearby towns were destroyed. No one will ever live there again. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 49:19 Like a lion coming out of the thick woods along the Jordan River up to the green pasture land, I will come and make the Edomites run away suddenly from their country. Then the leader I choose will rule the nation. Who can be compared to me? Who would dare challenge me? What ruler could oppose me? 
24Jr 49:20 So listen to the plan that I have made against the people of Edom, and to what I intend to do to the people of the city of Teman. Even their children will be dragged off, and everyone will be horrified. 
24Jr 49:21 When Edom falls, there will be such a noise that the entire earth will shake, and the cries of alarm will be heard as far away as the Gulf of Aqaba. 
24Jr 49:22 The enemy will attack Bozrah like an eagle swooping down with outspread wings. On that day Edom's soldiers will be as frightened as a woman in labor." 
24Jr 49:23 This is what the LORD said about Damascus�� "The people in the cities of Hamath and Arpad are worried and troubled because they have heard bad news. Anxiety rolls over them like a sea, and they cannot rest. 
24Jr 49:24 The people of Damascus are weak and have fled in terror. They are in pain and misery like a woman in labor. 
24Jr 49:25 The famous city that used to be happy is completely deserted. 
24Jr 49:26 On that day her young men will be killed in the city streets, and all her soldiers destroyed. 
24Jr 49:27 I will set the walls of Damascus on fire and will burn down King Benhadad's palaces. I, the LORD Almighty, have spoken." 
24Jr 49:28 This is what the LORD said about the tribe of Kedar and the districts controlled by Hazor, which were conquered by King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia�� "Attack the people of Kedar and destroy that tribe of eastern people! 
24Jr 49:29 Seize their tents and their flocks, their tent curtains and everything in their tents. Take their camels and tell the people, 'Terror is all around you!' 
24Jr 49:30 "People of Hazor, I, the LORD, warn you to run far away and hide. King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia has plotted against you, and this is what he says, 
24Jr 49:31 'Come on! We'll attack those people that feel safe and secure! Their city has no gates or locks and is completely unprotected.' 
24Jr 49:32 "Take their camels and all their livestock! I will scatter in every direction those people who cut their hair short, and I will bring disaster on them from every side. 
24Jr 49:33 Hazor will be made a desert forever, a place where only jackals live. No one will ever live there again. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 49:34 Soon after Zedekiah became king of Judah, the LORD Almighty spoke to me about the country of Elam. 
24Jr 49:35 He said, "I will kill all the archers who have made Elam so powerful. 
24Jr 49:36 I will make winds blow against Elam from all directions, and I will scatter her people everywhere, until there is no country where her refugees have not gone. 
24Jr 49:37 I will make the people of Elam afraid of their enemies, who want to kill them. In my great anger I will destroy the people of Elam and send armies against them until I have wiped them out. 
24Jr 49:38 I will destroy their kings and leaders, and set up my throne there. 
24Jr 49:39 But later on I will make the people of Elam prosperous again. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 50:1 This is the message that the LORD gave me about the city of Babylon and its people�� 
24Jr 50:2 "Tell the news to the nations! Proclaim it! Give the signal and announce the news! Do not keep it a secret! Babylon has fallen! Her god Marduk has been shattered! Babylon's idols are put to shame; her disgusting images are crushed! 
24Jr 50:3 "A nation from the north has come to attack Babylonia and will make it a desert. People and animals will run away, and no one will live there." 
24Jr 50:4 The LORD says, "When that time comes, the people of both Israel and Judah will come weeping, looking for me, their God. 
24Jr 50:5 They will ask the way to Zion and then go in that direction. They will make an eternal covenant with me and never break it. 
24Jr 50:6 "My people are like sheep whose shepherds have let them get lost in the mountains. They have wandered like sheep from one mountain to another, and they have forgotten where their home is. 
24Jr 50:7 They are attacked by all who find them. Their enemies say, 'They sinned against the LORD, and so what we have done is not wrong. Their ancestors trusted in the LORD, and they themselves should have remained faithful to him.' 
24Jr 50:8 "People of Israel, run away from Babylonia! Leave the country! Be the first to leave! 
24Jr 50:9 I am going to stir up a group of strong nations in the north and make them attack Babylonia. They will line up in battle against the country and conquer it. They are skillful hunters, shooting arrows that never miss the mark. 
24Jr 50:10 Babylonia will be looted, and those who loot it will take everything they want. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 50:11 The LORD says, "People of Babylonia, you plundered my nation. You are happy and glad, going about like a cow threshing grain or like a neighing horse, 
24Jr 50:12 but your own great city will be humiliated and disgraced. Babylonia will be the least important nation of all; it will become a dry and waterless desert. 
24Jr 50:13 Because of my anger no one will live in Babylon; it will be left in ruins, and all who pass by will be shocked and amazed. 
24Jr 50:14 "Archers, line up for battle against Babylon and surround it. Shoot all your arrows at Babylon, because it has sinned against me, the LORD. 
24Jr 50:15 Raise the war cry all around the city! Now Babylon has surrendered. Its walls have been broken through and torn down. I am taking my revenge on the Babylonians. So take your revenge on them, and treat them as they have treated others. 
24Jr 50:16 Do not let seeds be planted in that country nor let a harvest be gathered. Every foreigner living there will be afraid of the attacking army and will go back home." 
24Jr 50:17 The LORD says, "The people of Israel are like sheep, chased and scattered by lions. First, they were attacked by the emperor of Assyria, and then King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia gnawed on their bones. 
24Jr 50:18 Because of this, I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, will punish King Nebuchadnezzar and his country, just as I punished the emperor of Assyria. 
24Jr 50:19 I will restore the people of Israel to their land. They will eat the food that grows on Mount Carmel and in the region of Bashan, and they will eat all they want of the crops that grow in the territories of Ephraim and Gilead. 
24Jr 50:20 When that time comes, no sin will be found in Israel and no wickedness in Judah, because I will forgive those people whose lives I have spared. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 50:21 The LORD says, "Attack the people of Merathaim and of Pekod. Kill and destroy them. Do everything I command you. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 50:22 The noise of battle is heard in the land, and there is great destruction. 
24Jr 50:23 Babylonia hammered the whole world to pieces, and now that hammer is shattered! All the nations are shocked at what has happened to that country. 
24Jr 50:24 Babylonia, you fought against me, and you have been caught in the trap I set for you, even though you did not know it. 
24Jr 50:25 I have opened the place where my weapons are stored, and in my anger I have taken them out, because I, the Sovereign LORD Almighty, have work to do in Babylonia. 
24Jr 50:26 Attack it from every side and break open the places where its grain is stored! Pile up the loot like piles of grain! Destroy the country! Leave nothing at all! 
24Jr 50:27 Kill all their soldiers! Slaughter them! The people of Babylonia are doomed! The time has come for them to be punished!" 
24Jr 50:28 (Refugees escape from Babylonia and come to Jerusalem, and they tell how the LORD our God took revenge for what the Babylonians had done to his Temple.) 
24Jr 50:29 "Tell the archers to attack Babylon. Send out everyone who knows how to use the bow and arrow. Surround the city and don't let anyone escape. Pay it back for all it has done, and treat it as it has treated others, because it acted with pride against me, the Holy One of Israel. 
24Jr 50:30 So its young men will be killed in the city streets, and all its soldiers will be destroyed on that day. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 50:31 "Babylonia, you are filled with pride, so I, the Sovereign LORD Almighty, am against you! The time has come for me to punish you. 
24Jr 50:32 Your proud nation will stumble and fall, and no one will help you up. I will set your cities on fire, and everything around will be destroyed." 
24Jr 50:33 The LORD Almighty says, "The people of Israel and of Judah are oppressed. All who captured them are guarding them closely and will not let them go. 
24Jr 50:34 But the one who will rescue them is strong - his name is the LORD Almighty. He himself will take up their cause and will bring peace to the earth, but trouble to the people of Babylonia." 
24Jr 50:35 The LORD says, "Death to Babylonia! Death to its people, to its rulers, to its people of wisdom. 
24Jr 50:36 Death to its lying prophets - what fools they are! Death to its soldiers - how terrified they are! 
24Jr 50:37 Destroy its horses and chariots! Death to its hired soldiers - how weak they are! Destroy its treasures; plunder and loot. 
24Jr 50:38 Bring a drought on its land and dry up its rivers. Babylonia is a land of terrifying idols that have made fools of the people. 
24Jr 50:39 "And so Babylon will be haunted by demons and evil spirits, and by unclean birds. Never again will people live there, not for all time to come. 
24Jr 50:40 The same thing will happen to Babylon that happened to Sodom and Gomorrah, when I destroyed them and the nearby towns. No one will ever live there again. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 50:41 "People are coming from a country in the north, a mighty nation far away; many kings are preparing for war. 
24Jr 50:42 They have taken their bows and swords; they are cruel and merciless. They sound like the roaring sea, as they ride their horses. They are ready for battle against Babylonia. 
24Jr 50:43 The king of Babylonia hears the news, and his hands hang limp. He is seized by anguish, by pain like a woman in labor. 
24Jr 50:44 "Like a lion coming out of the thick woods along the Jordan up to the green pasture land, I, the LORD, will come and make the Babylonians run away suddenly from their city. Then the leader I choose will rule the nation. Who can be compared to me? Who would dare challenge me? What ruler could oppose me? 
24Jr 50:45 So listen to the plan that I have made against the city of Babylon and to what I intend to do to its people. Even their children will be dragged off, and everyone will be horrified. 
24Jr 50:46 When Babylon falls, there will be such a noise that the entire earth will shake, and the cries of alarm will be heard by the other nations." 
24Jr 51:1 The LORD says, "I am bringing a destructive wind against Babylonia and its people. 
24Jr 51:2 I will send foreigners to destroy Babylonia like a wind that blows straw away. When that day of destruction comes, they will attack from every side and leave the land bare. 
24Jr 51:3 Don't give its soldiers time to shoot their arrows or to put on their armor. Do not spare the young men! Destroy the whole army! 
24Jr 51:4 They will be wounded and die in the streets of their cities. 
24Jr 51:5 I, the LORD God Almighty, have not abandoned Israel and Judah, even though they have sinned against me, the Holy One of Israel. 
24Jr 51:6 Run away from Babylonia! Run for your lives! Do not be killed because of Babylonia's sin. I am now taking my revenge and punishing it as it deserves. 
24Jr 51:7 Babylonia was like a gold cup in my hand, making the whole world drunk. The nations drank its wine and went out of their minds. 
24Jr 51:8 Babylonia has suddenly fallen and is destroyed! Mourn over it! Get medicine for its wounds, and maybe it can be healed. 
24Jr 51:9 Foreigners living there said, 'We tried to help Babylonia, but it was too late. Let's leave now and go back home. God has punished Babylonia with all his might and has destroyed it completely.' " 
24Jr 51:10 The LORD says, "My people shout, 'The LORD has shown that we are in the right. Let's go and tell the people in Jerusalem what the LORD our God has done.' " 
24Jr 51:11 The LORD has stirred up the kings of Media, because he intends to destroy Babylonia. That is how he will take revenge for the destruction of his Temple. The attacking officers command, "Sharpen your arrows! Get your shields ready! 
24Jr 51:12 Give the signal to attack Babylon's walls. Strengthen the guard! Post the sentries! Place troops in ambush!" The LORD has done what he said he would do to the people of Babylonia. 
24Jr 51:13 That country has many rivers and rich treasures, but its time is up, and its thread of life is cut. 
24Jr 51:14 The LORD Almighty has sworn by his own life that he will bring many men to attack Babylonia like a swarm of locusts, and they will shout with victory. 
24Jr 51:15 The LORD made the earth by his power; by his wisdom he created the world and stretched out the heavens. 
24Jr 51:16 At his command the waters above the sky roar; he brings clouds from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning flash in the rain and sends the wind from his storeroom. 
24Jr 51:17 At the sight of this, people feel stupid and senseless; those who make idols are disillusioned because the gods they make are false and lifeless. 
24Jr 51:18 They are worthless and should be despised; they will be destroyed when the LORD comes to deal with them. 
24Jr 51:19 The God of Jacob is not like them; he is the one who made everything, and he has chosen Israel to be his very own people. The LORD Almighty is his name. 
24Jr 51:20 The LORD says, "Babylonia, you are my hammer, my weapon of war. I used you to crush nations and kingdoms, 
24Jr 51:21 to shatter horses and riders, to shatter chariots and their drivers, 
24Jr 51:22 to kill men and women, to slay old and young, to kill boys and girls, 
24Jr 51:23 to slaughter shepherds and their flocks, to slaughter farmers and their plow horses, to crush rulers and high officials." 
24Jr 51:24 The LORD says, "You will see me repay Babylonia and its people for all the evil they did to Jerusalem. 
24Jr 51:25 Babylonia, you are like a mountain that destroys the whole world, but I, the LORD, am your enemy. I will take hold of you, level you to the ground, and leave you in ashes. 
24Jr 51:26 None of the stones from your ruins will ever be used again for building. You will be like a desert forever. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
24Jr 51:27 "Give the signal to attack! Blow the trumpet so that the nations can hear! Prepare the nations for war against Babylonia! Tell the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz to attack. Appoint an officer to lead the attack. Bring up the horses like a swarm of locusts. 
24Jr 51:28 Prepare the nations for war against Babylonia. Send for the kings of Media, their leaders and officials, and the armies of all the countries they control. 
24Jr 51:29 The earth trembles and shakes because the LORD is carrying out his plan to make Babylonia a desert, where no one lives. 
24Jr 51:30 The Babylonian soldiers have stopped fighting and remain in their forts. They have lost their courage and have become helpless. The city gates are broken down, and the houses are on fire. 
24Jr 51:31 Messenger after messenger runs to tell the king of Babylonia that his city has been broken into from every side. 
24Jr 51:32 The enemy have captured the river crossing and have set the fortresses on fire. The Babylonian soldiers have panicked. 
24Jr 51:33 Soon the enemy will cut them down and trample them like grain on a threshing place. I, the LORD Almighty, the God of Israel, have spoken." 
24Jr 51:34 The king of Babylonia cut Jerusalem up and ate it. He emptied the city like a jar; like a monster he swallowed it. He took what he wanted and threw the rest away. 
24Jr 51:35 Let the people of Zion say, "May Babylonia be held responsible for the violence done to us!" Let the people of Jerusalem say, "May Babylonia be held responsible for what we have suffered!" 
24Jr 51:36 And so the LORD said to the people of Jerusalem, "I will take up your cause and will make your enemies pay for what they did to you. I will dry up the source of Babylonia's water and make its rivers go dry. 
24Jr 51:37 That country will become a pile of ruins where wild animals live. It will be a horrible sight; no one will live there, and all who see it will be terrified. 
24Jr 51:38 The Babylonians all roar like lions and growl like lion cubs. 
24Jr 51:39 Are they greedy? I will prepare them a feast and make them drunk and happy. They will go to sleep and never wake up. 
24Jr 51:40 I will take them to be slaughtered, like lambs, goats, and rams. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 51:41 The LORD says about Babylon�� "The city that the whole world praised has been captured! What a horrifying sight Babylon has become to the nations! 
24Jr 51:42 The sea has rolled over Babylon and covered it with roaring waves. 
24Jr 51:43 The towns have become a horrifying sight and are like a waterless desert, where no one lives or even travels. 
24Jr 51:44 I will punish Bel, the god of Babylonia, and make him give up his stolen goods; the nations will not worship him any more. "Babylon's walls have fallen. 
24Jr 51:45 People of Israel, run away from there! Run for your life from my fierce anger. 
24Jr 51:46 Do not lose courage or be afraid because of the rumors you hear. Every year a different rumor spreads - rumors of violence in the land and of one king fighting another. 
24Jr 51:47 And so the time is coming when I will deal with Babylonia's idols. The whole country will be put to shame, and all its people will be killed. 
24Jr 51:48 Everything on earth and in the sky will shout for joy when Babylonia falls to the people who come from the north to destroy it. 
24Jr 51:49 Babylonia caused the death of people all over the world, and now Babylonia will fall because it caused the death of so many Israelites. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 51:50 The LORD says to his people in Babylonia�� "You have escaped death! Now go! Don't wait! Though you are far from home, think about me, your LORD, and remember Jerusalem. 
24Jr 51:51 You say, 'We've been disgraced and made ashamed; we feel completely helpless because foreigners have taken over the holy places in the Temple.' 
24Jr 51:52 So then, I say that the time is coming when I will deal with Babylon's idols, and the wounded will groan throughout the country. 
24Jr 51:53 Even if Babylon could climb to the sky and build a strong fortress there, I would still send people to destroy it. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
24Jr 51:54 The LORD says, "Listen to the sound of crying in Babylon, of mourning for the destruction in the land. 
24Jr 51:55 I am destroying Babylon and putting it to silence. The armies rush in like roaring waves and attack with noisy shouts. 
24Jr 51:56 They have come to destroy Babylon; its soldiers are captured, and their bows are broken. I am a God who punishes evil, and I will treat Babylon as it deserves. 
24Jr 51:57 I will make its rulers drunk - men of wisdom, leaders, and soldiers. They will go to sleep and never wake up. I, the king, have spoken; I am the LORD Almighty. 
24Jr 51:58 The walls of mighty Babylon will be thrown to the ground, and its towering gates burned down. The work of the nations is all for nothing; their efforts go up in flames. I, the LORD Almighty, have spoken." 
24Jr 51:59 King Zedekiah's personal attendant was Seraiah, the son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah. In the fourth year that Zedekiah was king of Judah, Seraiah was going to Babylonia with him, and I gave him some instructions. 
24Jr 51:60 I wrote in a book an account of all the destruction that would come on Babylonia, as well as all these other things about Babylonia. 
24Jr 51:61 I told Seraiah, "When you get to Babylon, be sure to read aloud to the people everything that is written here. 
24Jr 51:62 Then pray, ' LORD, you have said that you would destroy this place, so that there would be no living creatures in it, neither people nor animals, and it would be like a desert forever.' 
24Jr 51:63 Seraiah, when you finish reading this book to the people, then tie it to a rock and throw it into the Euphrates River 
24Jr 51:64 and say, 'This is what will happen to Babylonia - it will sink and never rise again because of the destruction that the LORD is going to bring on it.' " The words of Jeremiah end here. 
24Jr 52:1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king of Judah, and he ruled in Jerusalem for eleven years. His mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of the Jeremiah who lived in the city of Libnah. 
24Jr 52:2 King Zedekiah sinned against the LORD, just as King Jehoiakim had done. 
24Jr 52:3 The LORD became so angry with the people of Jerusalem and Judah that he banished them from his sight. Zedekiah rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, 
24Jr 52:4 and so Nebuchadnezzar came with all his army and attacked Jerusalem on the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign. They set up camp outside the city, built siege walls around it, 
24Jr 52:5 and kept it under siege until Zedekiah's eleventh year. 
24Jr 52:6 On the ninth day of the fourth month of that same year, when the famine was so bad that the people had nothing left to eat, 
24Jr 52:7 the city walls were broken through. Although the Babylonians were surrounding the city, all the soldiers escaped during the night. They left by way of the royal garden, went through the gateway connecting the two walls, and fled in the direction of the Jordan Valley. 
24Jr 52:8 But the Babylonian army pursued King Zedekiah, captured him in the plains near Jericho, and all his soldiers deserted him. 
24Jr 52:9 Zedekiah was taken to King Nebuchadnezzar, who was in the city of Riblah in the territory of Hamath, and there Nebuchadnezzar passed sentence on him. 
24Jr 52:10 At Riblah he put Zedekiah's sons to death while Zedekiah was looking on and he also had the officials of Judah executed. 
24Jr 52:11 After that, he had Zedekiah's eyes put out and had him placed in chains and taken to Babylon. Zedekiah remained in prison in Babylon until the day he died. 
24Jr 52:12 On the tenth day of the fifth month of the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia, Nebuzaradan, adviser to the king and commander of his army, entered Jerusalem. 
24Jr 52:13 He burned down the Temple, the palace, and the houses of all the important people in Jerusalem; 
24Jr 52:14 and his soldiers tore down the city walls. 
24Jr 52:15 Then Nebuzaradan took away to Babylonia the people who were left in the city, the remaining skilled workers, and those who had deserted to the Babylonians. 
24Jr 52:16 But he left in Judah some of the poorest people, who owned no property, and he put them to work in the vineyards and fields. 
24Jr 52:17 The Babylonians broke in pieces the bronze columns and the carts that were in the Temple, together with the large bronze tank, and they took all the bronze to Babylon. 
24Jr 52:18 They also took away the shovels and the ash containers used in cleaning the altar, the tools used in tending the lamps, the bowls used for catching the blood from the sacrifices, the bowls used for burning incense, and all the other bronze articles used in the Temple service. 
24Jr 52:19 They took away everything that was made of gold or silver�� the small bowls, the pans used for carrying live coals, the bowls for holding the blood from the sacrifices, the ash containers, the lampstands, the bowls used for incense, and the bowls used for pouring out wine offerings. 
24Jr 52:20 The bronze objects that King Solomon had made for the Temple - the two columns, the carts, the large tank, and the twelve bulls that supported it - were too heavy to weigh. 
24Jr 52:21 The two columns were identical�� each one was 27 feet high and 18 feet around. They were hollow, and the metal was 3 inches thick. 
24Jr 52:22 On top of each column was a bronze capital 7 1/2 feet high, and all around it was a grillwork decorated with pomegranates, all of which was also made of bronze. 
24Jr 52:23 On the grillwork of each column there were a hundred pomegranates in all, and ninety-six of these were visible from the ground. 
24Jr 52:24 In addition, Nebuzaradan, the commanding officer, took away as prisoners Seraiah the High Priest, Zephaniah the priest next in rank, and the three other important Temple officials. 
24Jr 52:25 From the city he took the officer who had been in command of the troops, seven of the king's personal advisers who were still in the city, the commander's assistant, who was in charge of military records, and sixty other important men. 
24Jr 52:26 Nebuzaradan took them to the king of Babylonia, who was in the city of Riblah 
24Jr 52:27 in the territory of Hamath. There the king had them beaten and put to death. So the people of Judah were carried away from their land into exile. 
24Jr 52:28 This is the record of the people that Nebuchadnezzar took away as prisoners�� in his seventh year as king he carried away 3,023; 
24Jr 52:29 in his eighteenth year, 832 from Jerusalem; 
24Jr 52:30 and in his twenty-third year, 745 - taken away by Nebuzaradan. In all, 4,600 people were taken away. 
24Jr 52:31 In the year that Evil-merodach became king of Babylonia, he showed kindness to King Jehoiachin of Judah by releasing him from prison. This happened on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month of the thirty-seventh year after Jehoiachin had been taken away as a prisoner. 
24Jr 52:32 Evil-merodach treated him kindly and gave him a position of greater honor than he gave the other kings who were exiles with him in Babylonia. 
24Jr 52:33 So Jehoiachin was permitted to change from his prison clothes and to dine at the king's table for the rest of his life. 
24Jr 52:34 Each day for as long as he lived, he was given a regular allowance for his needs.

25Lm 1:1 How lonely lies Jerusalem, once so full of people! Once honored by the world, she is now like a widow; The noblest of cities has fallen into slavery. 
25Lm 1:2 All night long she cries; tears run down her cheeks. Of all her former friends, not one is left to comfort her. Her allies have betrayed her and are all against her now. 
25Lm 1:3 Judah's people are helpless slaves, forced away from home. They live in other lands, with no place to call their own - Surrounded by enemies, with no way to escape. 
25Lm 1:4 No one comes to the Temple now to worship on the holy days. The young women who sang there suffer, and the priests can only groan. The city gates stand empty, and Zion is in agony. 
25Lm 1:5 Her enemies succeeded; they hold her in their power. The LORD has made her suffer for all her many sins; Her children have been captured and taken away. 
25Lm 1:6 The splendor of Jerusalem is a thing of the past. Her leaders are like deer that are weak from hunger, Whose strength is almost gone as they flee from the hunters. 
25Lm 1:7 A lonely ruin now, Jerusalem recalls her ancient splendor. When she fell to the enemy, there was no one to help her; Her conquerors laughed at her downfall. 
25Lm 1:8 Her honor is gone; she is naked and held in contempt. She groans and hides her face in shame. Jerusalem made herself filthy with terrible sin. 
25Lm 1:9 Her uncleanness was easily seen, but she showed no concern for her fate. Her downfall was terrible; no one can comfort her. Her enemies have won, and she cries to the LORD for mercy. 
25Lm 1:10 The enemies robbed her of all her treasures. She saw them enter the Temple itself, Where the LORD had forbidden Gentiles to go. 
25Lm 1:11 Her people groan as they look for something to eat; They exchange their treasures for food to keep themselves alive. "Look at me, LORD," the city cries; "see me in my misery." 
25Lm 1:12 "Look at me!" she cries to everyone who passes by. "No one has ever had pain like mine, Pain that the LORD brought on me in the time of his anger. 
25Lm 1:13 "He sent fire from above, a fire that burned inside me. He set a trap for me and brought me to the ground. Then he abandoned me and left me in constant pain. 
25Lm 1:14 "He took note of all my sins and tied them all together; He hung them around my neck, and I grew weak beneath the weight. The Lord gave me to my foes, and I was helpless against them. 
25Lm 1:15 "The Lord laughed at all my strongest soldiers; He sent an army to destroy my young men. He crushed my people like grapes in a wine press. 
25Lm 1:16 "That is why my eyes are overflowing with tears. No one can comfort me; no one can give me courage. The enemy has conquered me; my people have nothing left. 
25Lm 1:17 "I stretch out my hands, but no one will help me. The LORD has called enemies against me from every side; They treat me like some filthy thing. 
25Lm 1:18 "But the LORD is just, for I have disobeyed him. Listen to me, people everywhere; look at me in my pain. My young men and women have been taken away captive. 
25Lm 1:19 "I called to my allies, but they refused to help me. The priests and the leaders died in the city streets, Looking for food to keep themselves alive. 
25Lm 1:20 "Look, O LORD, at my agony, at the anguish of my soul! My heart is broken in sorrow for my sins. There is murder in the streets; even indoors there is death. 
25Lm 1:21 "Listen to my groans; there is no one to comfort me. My enemies are glad that you brought disaster on me. Bring the day you promised; make my enemies suffer as I do. 
25Lm 1:22 "Condemn them for all their wickedness; Punish them as you punished me for my sins. I groan in misery, and I am sick at heart." 
25Lm 2:1 The Lord in his anger has covered Zion with darkness. Its heavenly splendor he has turned into ruins. On the day of his anger he abandoned even his Temple. 
25Lm 2:2 The Lord destroyed without mercy every village in Judah And tore down the forts that defended the land. He brought disgrace on the kingdom and its rulers. 
25Lm 2:3 In his fury he shattered the strength of Israel; He refused to help us when the enemy came. He raged against us like fire, destroying everything. 
25Lm 2:4 He aimed his arrows at us like an enemy; He killed all those who were our joy and delight. Here in Jerusalem we felt his burning anger. 
25Lm 2:5 Like an enemy, the Lord has destroyed Israel; He has left her forts and palaces in ruins. He has brought on the people of Judah unending sorrow. 
25Lm 2:6 He smashed to pieces the Temple where we worshiped him; He has put an end to holy days and Sabbaths. King and priest alike have felt the force of his anger. 
25Lm 2:7 The Lord rejected his altar and deserted his holy Temple; He allowed the enemy to tear down its walls. They shouted in victory where once we had worshiped in joy. 
25Lm 2:8 The LORD was determined that the walls of Zion should fall; He measured them off to make sure of total destruction. The towers and walls now lie in ruins together. 
25Lm 2:9 The gates lie buried in rubble, their bars smashed to pieces. The king and the noblemen now are in exile. The Law is no longer taught, and the prophets have no visions from the LORD. 
25Lm 2:10 Jerusalem's old men sit on the ground in silence, With dust on their heads and sackcloth on their bodies. Young women bow their heads to the ground. 
25Lm 2:11 My eyes are worn out with weeping; my soul is in anguish. I am exhausted with grief at the destruction of my people. Children and babies are fainting in the streets of the city. 
25Lm 2:12 Hungry and thirsty, they cry to their mothers; They fall in the streets as though they were wounded, And slowly die in their mothers' arms. 
25Lm 2:13 O Jerusalem, beloved Jerusalem, what can I say? How can I comfort you? No one has ever suffered like this. Your disaster is boundless as the ocean; there is no possible hope. 
25Lm 2:14 Your prophets had nothing to tell you but lies; Their preaching deceived you by never exposing your sin. They made you think you did not need to repent. 
25Lm 2:15 People passing by the city look at you in scorn. They shake their heads and laugh at Jerusalem's ruins�� "Is this that lovely city? Is this the pride of the world?" 
25Lm 2:16 All your enemies mock you and glare at you with hate. They curl their lips and sneer, "We have destroyed it! This is the day we have waited for!" 
25Lm 2:17 The LORD has finally done what he threatened to do�� He has destroyed us without mercy, as he warned us long ago. He gave our enemies victory, gave them joy at our downfall. 
25Lm 2:18 O Jerusalem, let your very walls cry out to the Lord! Let your tears flow like rivers night and day; Wear yourself out with weeping and grief ! 
25Lm 2:19 All through the night get up again and again to cry out to the Lord; Pour out your heart and beg him for mercy on your children - Children starving to death on every street corner! 
25Lm 2:20 Look, O LORD! Why are you punishing us like this? Women are eating the bodies of the children they loved! Priests and prophets are being killed in the Temple itself ! 
25Lm 2:21 Young and old alike lie dead in the streets, Young men and women, killed by enemy swords. You slaughtered them without mercy on the day of your anger. 
25Lm 2:22 You invited my enemies to hold a carnival of terror all around me, And no one could escape on that day of your anger. They murdered my children, whom I had raised and loved. 
25Lm 3:1 I am one who knows what it is to be punished by God. 
25Lm 3:2 He drove me deeper and deeper into darkness 
25Lm 3:3 And beat me again and again with merciless blows. 
25Lm 3:4 He has left my flesh open and raw, and has broken my bones. 
25Lm 3:5 He has shut me in a prison of misery and anguish. 
25Lm 3:6 He has forced me to live in the stagnant darkness of death. 
25Lm 3:7 He has bound me in chains; I am a prisoner with no hope of escape. 
25Lm 3:8 I cry aloud for help, but God refuses to listen; 
25Lm 3:9 I stagger as I walk; stone walls block me wherever I turn. 
25Lm 3:10 He waited for me like a bear; he pounced on me like a lion. 
25Lm 3:11 He chased me off the road, tore me to pieces, and left me. 
25Lm 3:12 He drew his bow and made me the target for his arrows. 
25Lm 3:13 He shot his arrows deep into my body. 
25Lm 3:14 People laugh at me all day long; I am a joke to them all. 
25Lm 3:15 Bitter suffering is all he has given me for food and drink. 
25Lm 3:16 He rubbed my face in the ground and broke my teeth on rocks. 
25Lm 3:17 I have forgotten what health and peace and happiness are. 
25Lm 3:18 I do not have much longer to live; my hope in the LORD is gone. 
25Lm 3:19 The thought of my pain, my homelessness, is bitter poison. 
25Lm 3:20 I think of it constantly, and my spirit is depressed. 
25Lm 3:21 Yet hope returns when I remember this one thing�� 
25Lm 3:22 The LORD's unfailing love and mercy still continue, 
25Lm 3:23 Fresh as the morning, as sure as the sunrise. 
25Lm 3:24 The LORD is all I have, and so in him I put my hope. 
25Lm 3:25 The LORD is good to everyone who trusts in him, 
25Lm 3:26 So it is best for us to wait in patience - to wait for him to save us - 
25Lm 3:27 And it is best to learn this patience in our youth. 
25Lm 3:28 When we suffer, we should sit alone in silent patience; 
25Lm 3:29 We should bow in submission, for there may still be hope. 
25Lm 3:30 Though beaten and insulted, we should accept it all. 
25Lm 3:31 The Lord is merciful and will not reject us forever. 
25Lm 3:32 He may bring us sorrow, but his love for us is sure and strong. 
25Lm 3:33 He takes no pleasure in causing us grief or pain. 
25Lm 3:34 The Lord knows when our spirits are crushed in prison; 
25Lm 3:35 He knows when we are denied the rights he gave us; 
25Lm 3:36 When justice is perverted in court, he knows. 
25Lm 3:37 The will of the Lord alone is always carried out. 
25Lm 3:38 Good and evil alike take place at his command. 
25Lm 3:39 Why should we ever complain when we are punished for our sin? 
25Lm 3:40 Let us examine our ways and turn back to the LORD. 
25Lm 3:41 Let us open our hearts to God in heaven and pray, 
25Lm 3:42 "We have sinned and rebelled, and you, O LORD, have not forgiven us. 
25Lm 3:43 "You pursued us and killed us; your mercy was hidden by your anger, 
25Lm 3:44 By a cloud of fury too thick for our prayers to get through. 
25Lm 3:45 You have made us the garbage dump of the world. 
25Lm 3:46 "We are insulted and mocked by all our enemies. 
25Lm 3:47 We have been through disaster and ruin; we live in danger and fear. 
25Lm 3:48 My eyes flow with rivers of tears at the destruction of my people. 
25Lm 3:49 "My tears will pour out in a ceaseless stream 
25Lm 3:50 Until the LORD looks down from heaven and sees us. 
25Lm 3:51 My heart is grieved when I see what has happened to the women of the city. 
25Lm 3:52 "I was trapped like a bird by enemies who had no cause to hate me. 
25Lm 3:53 They threw me alive into a pit and closed the opening with a stone. 
25Lm 3:54 Water began to close over me, and I thought death was near. 
25Lm 3:55 "From the bottom of the pit, O LORD, I cried out to you, 
25Lm 3:56 And when I begged you to listen to my cry, you heard. 
25Lm 3:57 You answered me and told me not to be afraid. 
25Lm 3:58 "You came to my rescue, Lord, and saved my life. 
25Lm 3:59 Judge in my favor; you know the wrongs done against me. 
25Lm 3:60 You know how my enemies hate me and how they plot against me. 
25Lm 3:61 "You have heard them insult me, O LORD; you know all their plots. 
25Lm 3:62 All day long they talk about me and make their plans. 
25Lm 3:63 From morning till night they make fun of me. 
25Lm 3:64 "Punish them for what they have done, O LORD; 
25Lm 3:65 Curse them and fill them with despair! 
25Lm 3:66 Hunt them down and wipe them off the earth!" 
25Lm 4:1 Our glittering gold has grown dull; the stones of the Temple lie scattered in the streets. 
25Lm 4:2 Zion's young people were as precious to us as gold, but now they are treated like common clay pots. 
25Lm 4:3 Even a mother wolf will nurse her cubs, but my people are like ostriches, cruel to their young. 
25Lm 4:4 They let their babies die of hunger and thirst; children are begging for food that no one will give them. 
25Lm 4:5 People who once ate the finest foods die starving in the streets; those raised in luxury are pawing through garbage for food. 
25Lm 4:6 My people have been punished even more than the inhabitants of Sodom, which met a sudden downfall at the hands of God. 
25Lm 4:7 Our princes were undefiled and pure as snow, vigorous and strong, glowing with health. 
25Lm 4:8 Now they lie unknown in the streets, their faces blackened in death; their skin, dry as wood, has shriveled on their bones. 
25Lm 4:9 Those who died in the war were better off than those who died later, who starved slowly to death, with no food to keep them alive. 
25Lm 4:10 The disaster that came to my people brought horror; loving mothers boiled their own children for food. 
25Lm 4:11 The LORD turned loose the full force of his fury; he lit a fire in Zion that burned it to the ground. 
25Lm 4:12 No one anywhere, not even rulers of foreign nations, believed that any invader could enter Jerusalem's gates. 
25Lm 4:13 But it happened, because her prophets sinned and her priests were guilty of causing the death of innocent people. 
25Lm 4:14 Her leaders wandered through the streets as though blind, so stained with blood that no one would touch them. 
25Lm 4:15 "Get away!" people shouted. "You're defiled! Don't touch me!" So they wandered from nation to nation, welcomed by no one. 
25Lm 4:16 The LORD had no more concern for them; he scattered them himself. He showed no regard for our priests and leaders. 
25Lm 4:17 For help that never came, we looked until we could look no longer. We kept waiting for help from a nation that had none to give. 
25Lm 4:18 The enemy was watching for us; we could not even walk in the streets. Our days were over; the end had come. 
25Lm 4:19 Swifter than eagles swooping from the sky, they chased us down. They tracked us down in the hills; they took us by surprise in the desert. 
25Lm 4:20 They captured the source of our life, the king the LORD had chosen, the one we had trusted to protect us from every invader. 
25Lm 4:21 Laugh on, people of Edom and Uz; be glad while you can. Your disaster is coming too; you too will stagger naked in shame. 
25Lm 4:22 Zion has paid for her sin; the LORD will not keep us in exile any longer. But Edom, the LORD will punish you; he will expose your guilty acts. 
25Lm 5:1 Remember, O LORD, what has happened to us. Look at us, and see our disgrace. 
25Lm 5:2 Our property is in the hands of strangers; foreigners are living in our homes. 
25Lm 5:3 Our fathers have been killed by the enemy, and now our mothers are widows. 
25Lm 5:4 We must pay for the water we drink; we must buy the wood we need for fuel. 
25Lm 5:5 Driven hard like donkeys or camels, we are tired, but are allowed no rest. 
25Lm 5:6 To get food enough to stay alive, we went begging to Egypt and Assyria. 
25Lm 5:7 Our ancestors sinned, but now they are gone, and we are suffering for their sins. 
25Lm 5:8 Our rulers are no better than slaves, and no one can save us from their power. 
25Lm 5:9 Murderers roam through the countryside; we risk our lives when we look for food. 
25Lm 5:10 Hunger has made us burn with fever until our skin is as hot as an oven. 
25Lm 5:11 Our wives have been raped on Mount Zion itself; in every Judean village our daughters have been forced to submit. 
25Lm 5:12 Our leaders have been taken and hanged; our elders are shown no respect. 
25Lm 5:13 Our young men are forced to grind grain like slaves; boys go staggering under heavy loads of wood. 
25Lm 5:14 The old people no longer sit at the city gate, and the young people no longer make music. 
25Lm 5:15 Happiness has gone out of our lives; grief has taken the place of our dances. 
25Lm 5:16 Nothing is left of all we were proud of. We sinned, and now we are doomed. 
25Lm 5:17 We are sick at our very hearts and can hardly see through our tears, 
25Lm 5:18 because Mount Zion lies lonely and deserted, and wild jackals prowl through its ruins. 
25Lm 5:19 But you, O LORD, are king forever and will rule to the end of time. 
25Lm 5:20 Why have you abandoned us so long? Will you ever remember us again? 
25Lm 5:21 Bring us back to you, LORD! Bring us back! Restore our ancient glory. 
25Lm 5:22 Or have you rejected us forever? Is there no limit to your anger? 
26
26Ezk 1:1 On the fifth day of the fourth month of the thirtieth year, I, Ezekiel the priest, son of Buzi, was living with the Jewish exiles by the Chebar River in Babylonia. The sky opened, and I saw a vision of God. 
26Ezk 1:2 (It was the fifth year since King Jehoiachin had been taken into exile.) 
26Ezk 1:3 There in Babylonia beside the Chebar River, I heard the LORD speak to me, and I felt his power. 
26Ezk 1:4 I looked up and saw a windstorm coming from the north. Lightning was flashing from a huge cloud, and the sky around it was glowing. Where the lightning was flashing, something shone like bronze. 
26Ezk 1:5 At the center of the storm I saw what looked like four living creatures in human form, 
26Ezk 1:6 but each of them had four faces and four wings. 
26Ezk 1:7 Their legs were straight, and they had hoofs like those of a bull. They shone like polished bronze. 
26Ezk 1:8 In addition to their four faces and four wings, they each had four human hands, one under each wing. 
26Ezk 1:9 Two wings of each creature were spread out so that the creatures formed a square, with their wing tips touching. When they moved, they moved as a group without turning their bodies. 
26Ezk 1:10 Each living creature had four different faces�� a human face in front, a lion's face at the right, a bull's face at the left, and an eagle's face at the back. 
26Ezk 1:11 Two wings of each creature were raised so that they touched the tips of the wings of the creatures next to it, and their other two wings were folded against their bodies. 
26Ezk 1:12 Each creature faced all four directions, and so the group could go wherever they wished, without having to turn. 
26Ezk 1:13 Among the creatures there was something that looked like a blazing torch, constantly moving. The fire would blaze up and shoot out flashes of lightning. 
26Ezk 1:14 The creatures themselves darted back and forth with the speed of lightning. 
26Ezk 1:15 As I was looking at the four creatures I saw four wheels touching the ground, one beside each of them. 
26Ezk 1:16 All four wheels were alike; each one shone like a precious stone, and each had another wheel intersecting it at right angles, 
26Ezk 1:17 so that the wheels could move in any of the four directions. 
26Ezk 1:18 The rims of the wheels were covered with eyes. 
26Ezk 1:19 Whenever the creatures moved, the wheels moved with them, and if the creatures rose up from the earth, so did the wheels. 
26Ezk 1:20 The creatures went wherever they wished, and the wheels did exactly what the creatures did, because the creatures controlled them. 
26Ezk 1:21 So every time the creatures moved or stopped or rose in the air, the wheels did exactly the same. 
26Ezk 1:22 Above the heads of the creatures there was something that looked like a dome made of dazzling crystal. 
26Ezk 1:23 There under the dome stood the creatures, each stretching out two wings toward the ones next to it and covering its body with the other two wings. 
26Ezk 1:24 I heard the noise their wings made in flight; it sounded like the roar of the sea, like the noise of a huge army, like the voice of Almighty God. When they stopped flying, they folded their wings, 
26Ezk 1:25 but there was still a sound coming from above the dome over their heads. 
26Ezk 1:26 Above the dome there was something that looked like a throne made of sapphire, and sitting on the throne was a figure that looked like a human being. 
26Ezk 1:27 The figure seemed to be shining like bronze in the middle of a fire. It shone all over with a bright light 
26Ezk 1:28 that had in it all the colors of the rainbow. This was the dazzling light which shows the presence of the LORD. When I saw this, I fell face downward on the ground. Then I heard a voice 
26Ezk 2:1 saying, "Mortal man, stand up. I want to talk to you." 
26Ezk 2:2 While the voice was speaking, God's spirit entered me and raised me to my feet, and I heard the voice continue, 
26Ezk 2:3 "Mortal man, I am sending you to the people of Israel. They have rebelled and turned against me and are still rebels, just as their ancestors were. 
26Ezk 2:4 They are stubborn and do not respect me, so I am sending you to tell them what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying to them. 
26Ezk 2:5 Whether those rebels listen to you or not, they will know that a prophet has been among them. 
26Ezk 2:6 "But you, mortal man, must not be afraid of them or of anything they say. They will defy and despise you; it will be like living among scorpions. Still, don't be afraid of those rebels or of anything they say. 
26Ezk 2:7 You will tell them whatever I tell you to say, whether they listen or not. Remember what rebels they are. 
26Ezk 2:8 "Mortal man, listen to what I tell you. Don't be rebellious like them. Open your mouth and eat what I am going to give you." 
26Ezk 2:9 I saw a hand reaching out toward me, and it was holding a scroll. 
26Ezk 2:10 The hand unrolled the scroll, and I saw that there was writing on both sides - cries of grief were written there, and wails and groans. 
26Ezk 3:1 God said, "Mortal man, eat this scroll; then go and speak to the people of Israel." 
26Ezk 3:2 So I opened my mouth, and he gave me the scroll to eat. 
26Ezk 3:3 He said, "Mortal man, eat this scroll that I give you; fill your stomach with it." I ate it, and it tasted as sweet as honey. 
26Ezk 3:4 Then God said, "Mortal man, go to the people of Israel and say to them whatever I tell you to say. 
26Ezk 3:5 I am not sending you to a nation that speaks a difficult foreign language, but to the Israelites. 
26Ezk 3:6 If I sent you to great nations that spoke difficult languages you didn't understand, they would listen to you. 
26Ezk 3:7 But none of the people of Israel will be willing to listen; they will not even listen to me. All of them are stubborn and defiant. 
26Ezk 3:8 Now I will make you as stubborn and as tough as they are. 
26Ezk 3:9 I will make you as firm as a rock, as hard as a diamond; don't be afraid of those rebels." 
26Ezk 3:10 God continued, "Mortal man, pay close attention and remember everything I tell you. 
26Ezk 3:11 Then go to the people of your nation who are in exile and tell them what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying to them, whether they pay attention to you or not." 
26Ezk 3:12 Then God's spirit lifted me up, and I heard behind me the loud roar of a voice that said, "Praise the glory of the LORD in heaven above!" 
26Ezk 3:13 I heard the wings of the creatures beating together in the air, and the noise of the wheels, as loud as an earthquake. 
26Ezk 3:14 The power of the LORD came on me with great force, and as his spirit carried me off, I felt bitter and angry. 
26Ezk 3:15 So I came to Tel Abib beside the Chebar River, where the exiles were living, and for seven days I stayed there, overcome by what I had seen and heard. 
26Ezk 3:16 After the seven days had passed, the LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 3:17 "Mortal man," he said, "I am making you a lookout for the nation of Israel. You will pass on to them the warnings I give you. 
26Ezk 3:18 If I announce that someone evil is going to die but you do not warn him to change his ways so that he can save his life, he will die, still a sinner, but I will hold you responsible for his death. 
26Ezk 3:19 If you do warn an evil man and he doesn't stop sinning, he will die, still a sinner, but your life will be spared. 
26Ezk 3:20 "If someone truly good starts doing evil and I put him in a dangerous situation, he will die if you do not warn him. He will die because of his sins - I will not remember the good he did - and I will hold you responsible for his death. 
26Ezk 3:21 If you do warn a good man not to sin and he listens to you and doesn't sin, he will stay alive, and your life will also be spared." 
26Ezk 3:22 I felt the powerful presence of the LORD and heard him say to me, "Get up and go out into the valley. I will talk to you there." 
26Ezk 3:23 So I went out into the valley, and there I saw the glory of the LORD, just as I had seen it beside the Chebar River. I fell face downward on the ground, 
26Ezk 3:24 but God's spirit entered me and raised me to my feet. The LORD said to me, "Go home and shut yourself up in the house. 
26Ezk 3:25 You will be tied with ropes, mortal man, and you will not be able to go out in public. 
26Ezk 3:26 I will paralyze your tongue so that you won't be able to warn these rebellious people. 
26Ezk 3:27 Then, when I speak to you again and give you back the power of speech, you will tell them what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying. Some of them will listen, but some will ignore you, for they are a nation of rebels." 
26Ezk 4:1 God said, "Mortal man, get a brick, put it in front of you, and scratch lines on it to represent the city of Jerusalem. 
26Ezk 4:2 Then, to represent a siege, put trenches, earthworks, camps, and battering rams all around it. 
26Ezk 4:3 Take an iron pan and set it up like a wall between you and the city. Face the city. It is under siege, and you are the one besieging it. This will be a sign to the nation of Israel. 
26Ezk 4:4 "Then lie down on your left side, and I will place on you the guilt of the nation of Israel. For 390 days you will stay there and suffer because of their guilt.
26Ezk 4:5 I have sentenced you to one day for each year their punishment will last. 
26Ezk 4:6 When you finish that, turn over on your right side and suffer for the guilt of Judah for forty days - one day for each year of their punishment. 
26Ezk 4:7 "Fix your eyes on the siege of Jerusalem. Shake your fist at the city and prophesy against it. 
26Ezk 4:8 I will tie you up so that you cannot turn from one side to the other until the siege is over. 
26Ezk 4:9 "Now take some wheat, barley, beans, peas, millet, and spelt. Mix them all together and make bread. That is what you are to eat during the 390 days you are lying on your left side. 
26Ezk 4:10 You will be allowed eight ounces of bread a day, and it will have to last until the next day. 
26Ezk 4:11 You will also have a limited amount of water to drink, two cups a day. 
26Ezk 4:12 You are to build a fire out of dried human excrement, bake bread on the fire, and eat it where everyone can see you." 
26Ezk 4:13 The LORD said, "This represents the way the Israelites will have to eat food which the Law forbids, when I scatter them to foreign countries." 
26Ezk 4:14 But I replied, "No, Sovereign LORD! I have never defiled myself. From childhood on I have never eaten meat from any animal that died a natural death or was killed by wild animals. I have never eaten any food considered unclean." 
26Ezk 4:15 So God said, "Very well. I will let you use cow dung instead, and you can bake your bread on that." 
26Ezk 4:16 And he added, "Mortal man, I am going to cut off the supply of bread for Jerusalem. The people there will be distressed and anxious as they measure out the food they eat and the water they drink. 
26Ezk 4:17 They will run out of bread and water; they will be in despair, and they will waste away because of their sins." 
26Ezk 5:1 The LORD said, "Mortal man, take a sharp sword and use it to shave off your beard and all your hair. Then weigh the hair on scales and divide it into three parts. 
26Ezk 5:2 Burn up a third of it in the city when the siege is over. Take another third and chop it up with your sword as you move around outside the city. Scatter the remaining third to the winds, and I will pursue it with my sword. 
26Ezk 5:3 Keep back a few hairs and wrap them in the hem of your clothes. 
26Ezk 5:4 Then take a few of them out again, throw them in the fire, and let them burn up. From them fire will spread to the whole nation of Israel." 
26Ezk 5:5 The Sovereign LORD said, "Look at Jerusalem. I put her at the center of the world, with other countries all around her. 
26Ezk 5:6 But Jerusalem rebelled against my commands and showed that she was more wicked than the other nations, more disobedient than the countries around her. Jerusalem rejected my commands and refused to keep my laws. 
26Ezk 5:7 Now listen, Jerusalem, to what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying. By not obeying my laws or keeping my commands, you have caused more trouble than the nations around you. You have followed the customs of other nations. 
26Ezk 5:8 And so I, the Sovereign LORD, am telling you that I am your enemy. I will pass judgment on you where all the nations can see it. 
26Ezk 5:9 Because of all the things you do that I hate, I will punish Jerusalem as I have never done before and will never do again. 
26Ezk 5:10 As a result, parents in Jerusalem will eat their children, and children will eat their parents. I will punish you and scatter in every direction any who are left alive. 
26Ezk 5:11 "Therefore, as I am the living God - this is the word of the Sovereign LORD - because you defiled my Temple with all the evil, disgusting things you did, I will cut you down without mercy. 
26Ezk 5:12 A third of your people will die from sickness and hunger in the city; a third will be cut down by swords outside the city; and I will scatter the last third to the winds and pursue them with a sword. 
26Ezk 5:13 "You will feel all the force of my anger and rage until I am satisfied. When all this happens, you will be convinced that I, the LORD, have spoken to you because I am outraged at your unfaithfulness. 
26Ezk 5:14 Everyone from the nations around you who passes by will sneer at you and keep their distance. 
26Ezk 5:15 "When I am angry and furious with you and punish you, all the nations around you will be terrified. They will look at you with disgust and make fun of you. 
26Ezk 5:16 I will cut off your supply of food and let you starve. You will feel the pains of hunger like sharp arrows sent to destroy you. 
26Ezk 5:17 I will send hunger and wild animals to kill your children, and will send sickness, violence, and war to kill you. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 6:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 6:2 "Mortal man," he said, "look toward the mountains of Israel and give them my message. 
26Ezk 6:3 Tell the mountains of Israel to hear the Sovereign LORD's word - to hear what I, the Sovereign LORD, am telling the mountains, the hills, the gorges, and the valleys�� I will send a sword to destroy the places where people worship idols. 
26Ezk 6:4 The altars will be torn down and the incense altars broken. All the people there will be killed in front of their idols. 
26Ezk 6:5 I will scatter the corpses of the people of Israel; I will scatter their bones all around the altars. 
26Ezk 6:6 All the cities of Israel will be destroyed, so that all their altars and their idols will be smashed to pieces, their incense altars will be shattered, and everything they made will disappear. 
26Ezk 6:7 People will be killed everywhere, and those who survive will acknowledge that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 6:8 "I will let some escape the slaughter and be scattered among the nations, 
26Ezk 6:9 where they will live in exile. There they will remember me and know that I have punished them and disgraced them, because their faithless hearts deserted me and they preferred idols to me. And they will be disgusted with themselves because of the evil and degrading things they have done. 
26Ezk 6:10 They will know that I am the LORD and that my warnings were not empty threats." 
26Ezk 6:11 The Sovereign LORD said, "Wring your hands! Stamp your feet! Cry in sorrow because of all the evil, disgusting things the Israelites have done. They are going to die in war or of starvation or disease. 
26Ezk 6:12 Those far away will get sick and die; those nearby will be killed in war; those who survive will starve to death. They will feel all the force of my anger. 
26Ezk 6:13 Corpses will be scattered among the idols and around the altars, scattered on every high hill, on the top of every mountain, under every green tree and every large oak, in every place where they burned sacrifices to their idols. Then everyone will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 6:14 Yes, I will reach out and destroy their country. I will make it a wasteland from the southern desert to the city of Riblah in the north, not sparing any place where the Israelites live. Then everyone will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 7:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 7:2 "Mortal man," he said, "this is what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying to the land of Israel�� This is the end for the whole land! 
26Ezk 7:3 "Israel, the end has come. You will feel my anger, because I am judging you for what you have done. I will pay you back for all your disgusting conduct. 
26Ezk 7:4 I will not spare you or show you any mercy. I am going to punish you for the disgusting things you have done, so that you will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 7:5 This is what the Sovereign LORD is saying�� "One disaster after another is coming on you. 
26Ezk 7:6 It's all over. This is the end. You are finished. 
26Ezk 7:7 The end is coming for you people who live in the land. The time is near when there will be no more celebrations at the mountain shrines, only confusion. 
26Ezk 7:8 "Very soon now you will feel all the force of my anger. I am judging you for what you have done, and I will pay you back for all your disgusting conduct. 
26Ezk 7:9 I will not spare you or show you any mercy. I am going to punish you for the disgusting things you have done, so that you will know that I am the LORD and that I am the one who punishes you." 
26Ezk 7:10 The day of disaster is coming. Violence is flourishing. Pride is at its height. 
26Ezk 7:11 Violence produces more wickedness. Nothing of theirs will remain, nothing of their wealth, their splendor, or their glory. 
26Ezk 7:12 The time is coming. The day is near when buying and selling will have no more meaning, because God's punishment will fall on everyone alike. 
26Ezk 7:13 No merchants will live long enough to get back what they have lost, because God's anger is on everyone. Those who are evil cannot survive. 
26Ezk 7:14 The trumpet blows, and everyone gets ready. But no one goes off to war, for God's anger will fall on everyone alike. 
26Ezk 7:15 There is fighting in the streets, and sickness and hunger in the houses. Anyone who is out in the country will die in the fighting, and anyone in the city will be a victim of sickness and hunger. 
26Ezk 7:16 Some will escape to the mountains like doves frightened from the valleys. All of them will moan over their sins. 
26Ezk 7:17 Everyone's hands will be weak, and their knees will shake. 
26Ezk 7:18 They will put on sackcloth and they will tremble all over. Their heads will be shaved, and they will all be disgraced. 
26Ezk 7:19 They will throw their gold and silver away in the streets like garbage, because neither silver nor gold can save them when the LORD pours out his fury. They cannot use it to satisfy their desires or fill their stomachs. Gold and silver led them into sin. 
26Ezk 7:20 Once they were proud of their beautiful jewels, but they used them to make disgusting idols. That is why the LORD has made their wealth repulsive to them. 
26Ezk 7:21 "I will let foreigners rob them," says the LORD, "and lawbreakers will take all their wealth and defile it. 
26Ezk 7:22 I will not interfere when my treasured Temple is profaned, when robbers break into it and defile it. 
26Ezk 7:23 "Everything is in confusion - the land is full of murders and the cities are full of violence. 
26Ezk 7:24 I will bring the most evil nations here and let them have your homes. Your strongest men will lose their confidence when I let the nations profane the places where you worship. 
26Ezk 7:25 Despair is coming. You will look for peace and never find it. 
26Ezk 7:26 One disaster will follow another, and a steady stream of bad news will pour in. You will beg the prophets to reveal what they foresee. The priests will have nothing to teach the people, and the elders will have no advice to give. 
26Ezk 7:27 The king will mourn, the prince will give up hope, and the people will shake with fear. I will punish you for all you have done, and will judge you in the same way as you have judged others. This will show you that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 8:1 On the fifth day of the sixth month of the sixth year of our exile, the leaders of the exiles from Judah were sitting in my house with me. Suddenly the power of the Sovereign LORD came on me. 
26Ezk 8:2 I looked up and saw a vision of a fiery human form. From the waist down his body looked like fire, and from the waist up he was shining like polished bronze. 
26Ezk 8:3 He reached out what seemed to be a hand and grabbed me by the hair. Then in this vision God's spirit lifted me high in the air and took me to Jerusalem. He took me to the inner entrance of the north gate of the Temple, where there was an idol that was an outrage to God. 
26Ezk 8:4 There I saw the dazzling light that shows the presence of Israel's God, just as I had seen it when I was by the Chebar River. 
26Ezk 8:5 God said to me, "Mortal man, look toward the north." I looked, and there near the altar by the entrance of the gateway I saw the idol that was an outrage to God. 
26Ezk 8:6 God said to me, "Mortal man, do you see what is happening? Look at the disgusting things the people of Israel are doing here, driving me farther and farther away from my holy place. You will see even more disgraceful things than this." 
26Ezk 8:7 He took me to the entrance of the outer courtyard and showed me a hole in the wall. 
26Ezk 8:8 He said, "Mortal man, break through the wall here." I broke through it and found a door. 
26Ezk 8:9 He told me, "Go in and look at the evil, disgusting things they are doing there." 
26Ezk 8:10 So I went in and looked. The walls were covered with drawings of snakes and other unclean animals, and of the other things which the Israelites were worshiping. 
26Ezk 8:11 Seventy Israelite leaders were there, including Jaazaniah son of Shaphan. Each one was holding an incense burner, and smoke was rising from the incense. 
26Ezk 8:12 God asked me, "Mortal man, do you see what the Israelite leaders are doing in secret? They are all worshiping in a room full of images. Their excuse is�� 'The LORD doesn't see us! He has abandoned the country.' " 
26Ezk 8:13 Then the LORD said to me, "You are going to see them do even more disgusting things than that." 
26Ezk 8:14 So he took me to the north gate of the Temple and showed me women weeping over the death of the god Tammuz. 
26Ezk 8:15 He asked, "Mortal man, do you see that? You will see even more disgusting things." 
26Ezk 8:16 So he took me to the inner courtyard of the Temple. There near the entrance of the sanctuary, between the altar and the porch, were about twenty-five men. They had turned their backs to the sanctuary and were bowing low toward the east, worshiping the rising sun. 
26Ezk 8:17 The LORD said to me, "Mortal man, do you see that? These people of Judah are not satisfied with merely doing all the disgusting things you have seen here and with spreading violence throughout the country. No, they must come and do them right here in the Temple and make me even more angry. Look how they insult me in the most offensive way possible! 
26Ezk 8:18 They will feel all the force of my anger. I will not spare them or show them any mercy. They will shout prayers to me as loud as they can, but I will not listen to them." 
26Ezk 9:1 Then I heard God shout, "Come here, you men who are going to punish the city. Bring your weapons with you." 
26Ezk 9:2 At once six men came from the outer north gate of the Temple, each one carrying a weapon. With them was a man dressed in linen clothes, carrying something to write with. They all came and stood by the bronze altar. 
26Ezk 9:3 Then the dazzling light of the presence of the God of Israel rose up from the winged creatures where it had been, and moved to the entrance of the Temple. The LORD called to the man dressed in linen, 
26Ezk 9:4 "Go through the whole city of Jerusalem and put a mark on the forehead of everyone who is distressed and troubled because of all the disgusting things being done in the city." 
26Ezk 9:5 And I heard God say to the other men, "Follow him through the city and kill. Spare no one; have mercy on no one. 
26Ezk 9:6 Kill the old men, young men, young women, mothers, and children. But don't touch anyone who has the mark on his forehead. Start here at my Temple." So they began with the leaders who were standing there at the Temple. 
26Ezk 9:7 God said to them, "Defile the Temple. Fill its courtyards with corpses. Get to work!" So they began to kill the people in the city. 
26Ezk 9:8 While the killing was going on, I was there alone. I threw myself face downward on the ground and shouted, "Sovereign LORD, are you so angry with Jerusalem that you are going to kill everyone left in Israel?" 
26Ezk 9:9 God answered, "The people of Israel and Judah are guilty of terrible sins. They have committed murder all over the land and have filled Jerusalem with crime. They say that I, the LORD, have abandoned their country and that I don't see them. 
26Ezk 9:10 But I will not have pity on them; I will do to them what they have done to others." 
26Ezk 9:11 Then the man wearing linen clothes returned and reported to the LORD, "I have carried out your orders." 
26Ezk 10:1 I looked at the dome over the heads of the living creatures and above them was something that seemed to be a throne made of sapphire. 
26Ezk 10:2 God said to the man wearing linen clothes, "Go between the wheels under the creatures and fill your hands with burning coals. Then scatter the coals over the city." I watched him go. 
26Ezk 10:3 The creatures were standing to the south of the Temple when he went in, and a cloud filled the inner courtyard. 
26Ezk 10:4 The dazzling light of the LORD's presence rose up from the creatures and moved to the entrance of the Temple. Then the cloud filled the Temple, and the courtyard was blazing with the light. 
26Ezk 10:5 The noise made by the creatures' wings was heard even in the outer courtyard. It sounded like the voice of Almighty God. 
26Ezk 10:6 When the LORD commanded the man wearing linen clothes to take some fire from between the wheels that were under the creatures, the man went in and stood by one of the wheels. 
26Ezk 10:7 One of the creatures reached his hand into the fire that was there among them, picked up some coals, and put them in the hands of the man in linen. The man took the coals and left. 
26Ezk 10:8 I saw that each creature had what looked like a human hand under each of its wings. 
26Ezk 10:9 I also saw that there were four wheels, all alike, one beside each creature. 
26Ezk 10:10 The wheels shone like precious stones, and each one had another wheel which intersected it at right angles. 
26Ezk 10:11 When the creatures moved, they could go in any direction without turning. They all moved together in the direction they wanted to go, without having to turn around. 
26Ezk 10:12 Their bodies, backs, hands, wings, and wheels were covered with eyes. 
26Ezk 10:13 I heard a voice calling out, "Whirling wheels." 
26Ezk 10:14 Each creature had four faces. The first was the face of a bull, the second a human face, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle. 
26Ezk 10:15 (They were the same creatures that I had seen by the Chebar River.) When the creatures rose in the air 
26Ezk 10:16 and moved, the wheels went with them. Whenever they spread their wings to fly, the wheels still went with them. 
26Ezk 10:17 When the creatures stopped, the wheels stopped; and when the creatures flew, the wheels went with them, because the creatures controlled them. 
26Ezk 10:18 Then the dazzling light of the LORD's presence left the entrance of the Temple and moved to a place above the creatures. 
26Ezk 10:19 They spread their wings and flew up from the earth while I was watching, and the wheels went with them. They paused at the east gate of the Temple, and the dazzling light was over them. 
26Ezk 10:20 I recognized them as the same creatures which I had seen beneath the God of Israel at the Chebar River. 
26Ezk 10:21 Each of them had four faces, four wings, and what looked like a human hand under each wing. 
26Ezk 10:22 Their faces looked exactly like the faces I had seen by the Chebar River. Each creature moved straight ahead. 
26Ezk 11:1 God's spirit lifted me up and took me to the east gate of the Temple. There near the gate I saw twenty-five men, including Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, two leaders of the nation. 
26Ezk 11:2 God said to me, "Mortal man, these men make evil plans and give bad advice in this city. 
26Ezk 11:3 They say, 'We will soon be building houses again. The city is like a cooking pot, and we are like the meat in it, but at least it protects us from the fire.' 
26Ezk 11:4 Now then, denounce them, mortal man." 
26Ezk 11:5 The spirit of the LORD took control of me, and the LORD told me to give the people this message�� "People of Israel, I know what you are saying and what you are planning. 
26Ezk 11:6 You have murdered so many people here in the city that the streets are full of corpses. 
26Ezk 11:7 "So this is what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying to you. This city is a cooking pot all right, but what is the meat? The corpses of those you have killed! You will not be here - I will throw you out of the city! 
26Ezk 11:8 Are you afraid of swords? I will bring soldiers with swords to attack you. 
26Ezk 11:9 I will take you out of the city and hand you over to foreigners. I have sentenced you to death, 
26Ezk 11:10 and you will be killed in battle in your own country. Then everyone will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 11:11 This city will not protect you the way a pot protects the meat in it. I will punish you wherever you may be in the land of Israel. 
26Ezk 11:12 You will know that I am the LORD and that while you were keeping the laws of the neighboring nations, you were breaking my laws and disobeying my commands."
26Ezk 11:13 While I was prophesying, Pelatiah dropped dead. I threw myself face downward on the ground and shouted, "No, Sovereign LORD! Are you going to kill everyone left in Israel?" 
26Ezk 11:14 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 11:15 "Mortal man," he said, "the people who live in Jerusalem are talking about you and those of your nation who are in exile. They say, 'The exiles are too far away to worship the LORD. He has given us possession of the land.' 
26Ezk 11:16 "Now tell your fellow exiles what I am saying. I am the one who sent them to live in far-off nations and scattered them in other countries. Yet, for the time being I will be present with them in the lands where they have gone. 
26Ezk 11:17 "So tell them what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying. I will gather them out of the countries where I scattered them, and will give the land of Israel back to them. 
26Ezk 11:18 When they return, they are to get rid of all the filthy, disgusting idols they find. 
26Ezk 11:19 I will give them a new heart and a new mind. I will take away their stubborn heart of stone and will give them an obedient heart. 
26Ezk 11:20 Then they will keep my laws and faithfully obey all my commands. They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
26Ezk 11:21 But I will punish the people who love to worship filthy, disgusting idols. I will punish them for what they have done." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 11:22 The living creatures began to fly, and the wheels went with them. The dazzling light of the presence of the God of Israel was over them. 
26Ezk 11:23 Then the dazzling light left the city and moved to the mountain east of it. 
26Ezk 11:24 In the vision the spirit of God lifted me up and brought me back to the exiles in Babylonia. Then the vision faded, 
26Ezk 11:25 and I told the exiles everything that the LORD had shown me. 
26Ezk 12:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 12:2 "Mortal man," he said, "you are living among rebellious people. They have eyes, but they see nothing; they have ears, but they hear nothing, because they are rebellious. 
26Ezk 12:3 "Now, mortal man, pack a bundle just as a refugee would and start out before nightfall. Let everyone see you leaving and going to another place. Maybe those rebels will notice you. 
26Ezk 12:4 While it is still daylight, pack your bundle for exile, so that they can see you, and then let them watch you leave in the evening as if you were going into exile. 
26Ezk 12:5 While they are watching, break a hole through the wall of your house and take your pack out through it. 
26Ezk 12:6 Let them watch you putting your pack on your shoulder and going out into the dark with your eyes covered, so that you can't see where you are going. What you do will be a warning to the Israelites." 
26Ezk 12:7 I did what the LORD told me to do. That day I packed a bundle as a refugee would, and that evening as it was getting dark I dug a hole in the wall with my hands and went out. While everyone watched, I put the pack on my shoulder and left. 
26Ezk 12:8 The next morning the LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 12:9 "Mortal man," he said, "now that those Israelite rebels are asking you what you're doing, 
26Ezk 12:10 tell them what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying to them. This message is for the prince ruling in Jerusalem and for all the people who live there. 
26Ezk 12:11 Tell them that what you have done is a sign of what will happen to them - they will be refugees and captives. 
26Ezk 12:12 The prince who is ruling them will shoulder his pack in the dark and escape through a hole that they dig for him in the wall. He will cover his eyes and not see where he is going. 
26Ezk 12:13 But I will spread out my net and trap him in it. Then I will take him to the city of Babylon, where he will die without having seen it. 
26Ezk 12:14 I will scatter in every direction all the members of his court and his advisers and bodyguards, and people will search for them to kill them. 
26Ezk 12:15 "When I scatter them among the other nations and in foreign countries, they will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 12:16 I will let a few of them survive the war, the famine, and the diseases, so that there among the nations they will realize how disgusting their actions have been and will acknowledge that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 12:17 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 12:18 "Mortal man," he said, "tremble when you eat, and shake with fear when you drink. 
26Ezk 12:19 Tell the whole nation that this is the message of the Sovereign LORD to the people of Jerusalem who are still living in their land�� They will tremble when they eat and shake with fear when they drink. Their land will be stripped bare, because everyone who lives there is lawless. 
26Ezk 12:20 Cities that are now full of people will be destroyed, and the country will be made a wilderness. Then they will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 12:21 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 12:22 "Mortal man," he said, "why do the people of Israel repeat this proverb�� 'Time goes by, and predictions come to nothing'? 
26Ezk 12:23 Now tell them what I, the Sovereign LORD, have to say about that. I will put an end to that proverb. It won't be repeated in Israel any more. Tell them instead�� The time has come, and the predictions are coming true! 
26Ezk 12:24 "Among the people of Israel there will be no more false visions or misleading prophecies. 
26Ezk 12:25 I, the LORD, will speak to them, and what I say will be done. There will be no more delay. In your own lifetime, you rebels, I will do what I have warned you I would do. I have spoken," says the Sovereign LORD. 
26Ezk 12:26 The LORD said to me, 
26Ezk 12:27 "Mortal man, the Israelites think that your visions and prophecies are about the distant future. 
26Ezk 12:28 So tell them that I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying�� There will be no more delay. What I have said will be done. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken!" 
26Ezk 13:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 13:2 "Mortal man," he said, "denounce the prophets of Israel who make up their own prophecies. Tell them to listen to the word of the LORD." 
26Ezk 13:3 This is what the Sovereign LORD says�� "These foolish prophets are doomed! They provide their own inspiration and invent their own visions. 
26Ezk 13:4 People of Israel, your prophets are as useless as foxes living among the ruins of a city. 
26Ezk 13:5 They don't guard the places where the walls have crumbled, nor do they rebuild the walls, and so Israel cannot be defended when war comes on the day of the LORD. 
26Ezk 13:6 Their visions are false, and their predictions are lies. They claim that they are speaking my message, but I have not sent them. Yet they expect their words to come true! 
26Ezk 13:7 I tell them�� Those visions you see are false, and the predictions you make are lies. You say that they are my words, but I haven't spoken to you!" 
26Ezk 13:8 So the Sovereign LORD says to them, "Your words are false, and your visions are lies. I am against you. 
26Ezk 13:9 I am about to punish you prophets who have false visions and make misleading predictions. You will not be there when my people gather to make decisions; your names will not be included in the list of the citizens of Israel; you will never return to your land. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD. 
26Ezk 13:10 "The prophets mislead my people by saying that all is well. All is certainly not well! My people have put up a wall of loose stones, and then the prophets have come and covered it with whitewash. 
26Ezk 13:11 Tell the prophets that their wall is going to fall down. I will send a pouring rain. Hailstones will fall on it, and a strong wind will blow against it. 
26Ezk 13:12 The wall will collapse, and everyone will ask you what good the whitewash did." 
26Ezk 13:13 Now this is what the Sovereign LORD says�� "In my anger I will send a strong wind, pouring rain, and hailstones to destroy the wall. 
26Ezk 13:14 I intend to break down the wall they whitewashed, to shatter it, and to leave the foundation stones bare. It will collapse and kill you all. Then everyone will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 13:15 "The wall and those who covered it with whitewash will feel the force of my anger. Then I will tell you that the wall is gone and so are those who whitewashed it - 
26Ezk 13:16 those prophets who assured Jerusalem that all was well, when all was not well!" The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 13:17 The LORD said, "Now, mortal man, look at the women among your people who make up predictions. Denounce them 
26Ezk 13:18 and tell them what the Sovereign LORD is saying to them�� "You women are doomed! You sew magic wristbands for everyone and make magic scarves for everyone to wear on their heads, so that they can have power over other people's lives. You want to possess the power of life and death over my people and to use it for your own benefit. 
26Ezk 13:19 You dishonor me in front of my people in order to get a few handfuls of barley and a few pieces of bread. You kill people who don't deserve to die, and you keep people alive who don't deserve to live. So you tell lies to my people, and they believe you." 
26Ezk 13:20 Now this is what the Sovereign LORD says�� "I hate the wristbands that you use in your attempt to control life and death. I will rip them off your arms and set free the people that you were controlling. 
26Ezk 13:21 I will rip off your scarves and let my people escape from your power once and for all. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 13:22 "By your lies you discourage good people, whom I do not wish to hurt. You prevent evil people from giving up evil and saving their lives. 
26Ezk 13:23 So now your false visions and misleading predictions are over. I am rescuing my people from your power, so that you will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 14:1 Some of the leaders of the Israelites came to consult me about the LORD's will. 
26Ezk 14:2 Then the LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 14:3 "Mortal man," he said, "these men have given their hearts to idols and are letting idols lead them into sin. Do they think I will give them an answer? 
26Ezk 14:4 "Now speak to them and tell them what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying to them�� Each of you Israelites who have given your heart to idols and let them lead you into sin and who then come to consult a prophet, will get an answer from me - the answer that your many idols deserve! 
26Ezk 14:5 All those idols have turned the Israelites away from me, but by my answer I hope to win back their loyalty. 
26Ezk 14:6 "Now then, tell the Israelites what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying�� Turn back and leave your disgusting idols. 
26Ezk 14:7 "Whenever one of you Israelites or one of you foreigners who live in the Israelite community turn away from me and worship idols, and then go to consult a prophet, I, the LORD, will give you your answer! 
26Ezk 14:8 I will oppose you. I will make an example of you. I will remove you from the community of my people, so that all of you will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 14:9 "If any prophets are deceived into giving a false answer, it is because I, the LORD, have deceived them. I will remove them from the people of Israel. 
26Ezk 14:10 Both prophets and anyone who consults them will get the same punishment. 
26Ezk 14:11 I will do this to keep the Israelites from deserting me and defiling themselves by their sins. They are to be my people, and I will be their God." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 14:12 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 14:13 "Mortal man," he said, "if a country sins and is unfaithful to me, I will reach out and destroy its supply of food. I will send a famine and kill people and animals alike. 
26Ezk 14:14 Even if those three men, Noah, Danel, and Job, were living there, their goodness would save only their own lives." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 14:15 "Or I might send wild animals to kill the people, making the land so dangerous that no one could travel through it, 
26Ezk 14:16 and even if those three men lived there - as surely as I, the Sovereign LORD, am the living God - they would not be able to save even their own children. They would save only their own lives, and the land would become a wilderness. 
26Ezk 14:17 "Or I might bring war on that country and send destructive weapons to wipe out people and animals alike, 
26Ezk 14:18 and even if those three men lived there - as surely as I, the Sovereign LORD, am the living God - they would not be able to save even their children, but only their own lives. 
26Ezk 14:19 "If I send an epidemic on that country and in my anger take many lives, killing people and animals, 
26Ezk 14:20 even if Noah, Danel, and Job lived there - as surely as I, the Sovereign LORD, am the living God - they would not be able to save even their own children. Their goodness would save only their own lives." 
26Ezk 14:21 This is what the Sovereign LORD is saying�� "I will send my four worst punishments on Jerusalem - war, famine, wild animals, and disease - to destroy people and animals alike. 
26Ezk 14:22 If some survive and save their children, look at them when they come to you. See how evil they are, and be convinced that the punishment I am bringing on Jerusalem is justified; 
26Ezk 14:23 then you will know that there was good reason for everything I did." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 15:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 15:2 "Mortal man," he said, "how does a vine compare with a tree? What good is a branch of a grapevine compared with the trees of the forest? 
26Ezk 15:3 Can you use it to make anything? Can you even make a peg out of it to hang things on? 
26Ezk 15:4 It is only good for building a fire. And when the ends are burned up and the middle is charred, can you make anything out of it? 
26Ezk 15:5 It was useless even before it was burned. Now that the fire has burned it and charred it, it is even more useless." 
26Ezk 15:6 Now this is what the Sovereign LORD is saying�� "Just as a vine is taken from the forest and burned, so I will take the people who live in Jerusalem 
26Ezk 15:7 and will punish them. They have escaped one fire, but now fire will burn them up. When I punish them, you will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 15:8 They have been unfaithful to me, and so I will make the country a wilderness." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 16:1 The LORD spoke to me again. 
26Ezk 16:2 "Mortal man," he said, "point out to Jerusalem what disgusting things she has done. 
26Ezk 16:3 Tell Jerusalem what the Sovereign LORD is saying to her�� "You were born in the land of Canaan. Your father was an Amorite, and your mother was a Hittite. 
26Ezk 16:4 When you were born, no one cut your umbilical cord or washed you or rubbed you with salt or wrapped you in cloths. 
26Ezk 16:5 No one took enough pity on you to do any of these things for you. When you were born, no one loved you. You were thrown out in an open field. 
26Ezk 16:6 "Then I passed by and saw you squirming in your own blood. You were covered with blood, but I wouldn't let you die. 
26Ezk 16:7 I made you grow like a healthy plant. You grew strong and tall and became a young woman. Your breasts were well-formed, and your hair had grown, but you were naked. 
26Ezk 16:8 "As I passed by again, I saw that the time had come for you to fall in love. I covered your naked body with my coat and promised to love you. Yes, I made a marriage covenant with you, and you became mine." This is what the Sovereign LORD says. 
26Ezk 16:9 "Then I took water and washed the blood off you. I rubbed olive oil on your skin. 
26Ezk 16:10 I dressed you in embroidered gowns and gave you shoes of the best leather, a linen headband, and a silk cloak. 
26Ezk 16:11 I put jewels on you - bracelets and necklaces. 
26Ezk 16:12 I gave you a nose ring and earrings and a beautiful crown to wear. 
26Ezk 16:13 You had ornaments of gold and silver, and you always wore clothes of embroidered linen and silk. You ate bread made from the best flour, and had honey and olive oil to eat. Your beauty was dazzling, and you became a queen. 
26Ezk 16:14 You became famous in every nation for your perfect beauty, because I was the one who made you so lovely." This is what the Sovereign LORD says. 
26Ezk 16:15 "But you took advantage of your beauty and fame to sleep with everyone who came along. 
26Ezk 16:16 You used some of your clothes to decorate your places of worship, and just like a prostitute, you gave yourself to everyone. 
26Ezk 16:17 You took the silver and gold jewelry that I had given you, used it to make male images, and committed adultery with them. 
26Ezk 16:18 You took the embroidered clothes I gave you and put them on the images, and you offered to the images the olive oil and incense I had given you. 
26Ezk 16:19 I gave you food - the best flour, olive oil, and honey - but you offered it as a sacrifice to win the favor of idols." This is what the Sovereign LORD says. 
26Ezk 16:20 "Then you took the sons and the daughters you had borne me and offered them as sacrifices to idols. Wasn't it bad enough to be unfaithful to me, 
26Ezk 16:21 without taking my children and sacrificing them to idols? 
26Ezk 16:22 During your disgusting life as a prostitute you never once remembered your childhood - when you were naked, squirming in your own blood." 
26Ezk 16:23 The Sovereign LORD said, "You are doomed! Doomed! You did all that evil, and then 
26Ezk 16:24 by the side of every road you built places to worship idols and practice prostitution. 
26Ezk 16:25 You dragged your beauty through the mud. You offered yourself to everyone who came by, and you were more of a prostitute every day. 
26Ezk 16:26 You let your lustful neighbors, the Egyptians, go to bed with you, and you used your prostitution to make me angry. 
26Ezk 16:27 "Now I have raised my hand to punish you and to take away your share of my blessing. I have handed you over to the Philistines, who hate you and are disgusted with your immoral actions. 
26Ezk 16:28 "Because you were not satisfied by the others, you went running after the Assyrians. You were their prostitute, but they didn't satisfy you either. 
26Ezk 16:29 You were also a prostitute for the Babylonians, that nation of merchants, but they didn't satisfy you either." 
26Ezk 16:30 This is what the Sovereign LORD is saying�� "You have done all this like a shameless prostitute. 
26Ezk 16:31 On every street you built places to worship idols and practice prostitution. But you are not out for money like a common prostitute. 
26Ezk 16:32 You are like a woman who commits adultery with strangers instead of loving her husband. 
26Ezk 16:33 A prostitute is paid, but you gave presents to all your lovers and bribed them to come from everywhere to sleep with you. 
26Ezk 16:34 You are a special kind of prostitute. No one forced you to become one. You didn't get paid; you paid them! Yes, you are different." 
26Ezk 16:35 Now then, Jerusalem, you whore! Hear what the LORD is saying. 
26Ezk 16:36 This is what the Sovereign LORD says�� "You stripped off your clothes, and like a prostitute, you gave yourself to your lovers and to all your disgusting idols, and you killed your children as sacrifices to idols. 
26Ezk 16:37 Because of this I will bring all your former lovers together - the ones you liked and the ones you hated. I will bring them around you in a circle, and then I will strip off your clothes and let them see you naked. 
26Ezk 16:38 I will condemn you for adultery and murder, and in my anger and fury I will punish you with death. 
26Ezk 16:39 I will put you in their power, and they will tear down the places where you engage in prostitution and worship idols. They will take away your clothes and jewels and leave you completely naked. 
26Ezk 16:40 "They will stir up a crowd to stone you, and they will cut you to pieces with their swords. 
26Ezk 16:41 They will burn your houses down and let crowds of women see your punishment. I will make you stop being a prostitute and make you stop giving gifts to your lovers. 
26Ezk 16:42 Then my anger will be over, and I will be calm. I will not be angry or jealous any more. 
26Ezk 16:43 You have forgotten how I treated you when you were young, and you have made me angry by all the things you did. That is why I have made you pay for them all. Why did you add sexual immorality to all the other disgusting things you did?" The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 16:44 The LORD said, "People will use this proverb about you, Jerusalem�� 'Like mother, like daughter.' 
26Ezk 16:45 You really are your mother's daughter. She detested her husband and her children. You are like your sisters, who hated their husbands and their children. You and your sister cities had a Hittite mother and an Amorite father. 
26Ezk 16:46 "Your older sister, with her villages, is Samaria, in the north. Your younger sister, with her villages, is Sodom, in the south. 
26Ezk 16:47 Were you satisfied to follow in their footsteps and copy their disgusting actions? No, in only a little while you were acting worse than they were in everything you did. 
26Ezk 16:48 "As surely as I am the living God," the Sovereign LORD says, "your sister Sodom and her villages never did the evil that you and your villages have done. 
26Ezk 16:49 She and her daughters were proud because they had plenty to eat and lived in peace and quiet, but they did not take care of the poor and the underprivileged. 
26Ezk 16:50 They were proud and stubborn and did the things that I hate, so I destroyed them, as you well know. 
26Ezk 16:51 "Samaria did not sin half as much as you have. You have acted more disgustingly than she ever did. Your corruption makes your sisters look innocent by comparison. 
26Ezk 16:52 And now you will have to endure your disgrace. Your sins are so much worse than those of your sisters that they look innocent beside you. Now blush and bear your shame, because you make your sisters look pure." 
26Ezk 16:53 The LORD said to Jerusalem, "I will make them prosperous again - Sodom and her villages and Samaria and her villages. Yes, I will make you prosperous too. 
26Ezk 16:54 You will be ashamed of yourself, and your disgrace will show your sisters how well-off they are. 
26Ezk 16:55 They will become prosperous again, and you and your villages will also be restored. 
26Ezk 16:56 Didn't you joke about Sodom in those days when you were proud 
26Ezk 16:57 and before the evil you did had been exposed? Now you are just like her - a joke to the Edomites, the Philistines, and your other neighbors who hate you. 
26Ezk 16:58 You must suffer for the obscene, disgusting things you have done." The LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 16:59 The Sovereign LORD says, "I will treat you the way you deserve, because you ignored your promises and broke the covenant. 
26Ezk 16:60 But I will honor the covenant I made with you when you were young, and I will make a covenant with you that will last forever. 
26Ezk 16:61 You will remember how you have acted, and be ashamed of it when you get your older sister and your younger sister back. I will let them be like daughters to you, even though this was not part of my covenant with you. 
26Ezk 16:62 I will renew my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 16:63 I will forgive all the wrongs you have done, but you will remember them and be too ashamed to open your mouth." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 17:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 17:2 "Mortal man," he said, "tell the Israelites a parable 
26Ezk 17:3 to let them know what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying to them�� There was a giant eagle with beautiful feathers and huge wings, spread wide. He flew to the Lebanon Mountains and broke off the top of a cedar tree, 
26Ezk 17:4 which he carried to a land of commerce and placed in a city of merchants. 
26Ezk 17:5 Then he took a young plant from the land of Israel and planted it in a fertile field, where there was always water to make it grow. 
26Ezk 17:6 The plant sprouted and became a low, wide-spreading grapevine. The branches grew upward toward the eagle, and the roots grew deep. The vine was covered with branches and leaves. 
26Ezk 17:7 "There was another giant eagle with huge wings and thick plumage. And now the vine sent its roots toward him and turned its leaves toward him, in the hope that he would give it more water than there was in the garden where it was growing. 
26Ezk 17:8 But the vine had already been planted in a fertile, well-watered field so that it could grow leaves and bear grapes and be a magnificent vine. 
26Ezk 17:9 "So I, the Sovereign LORD, ask�� Will this vine live and grow? Won't the first eagle pull it up by its roots, pull off the grapes, and break off the branches and let them wither? It will not take much strength or a mighty nation to pull it up. 
26Ezk 17:10 Yes, it is planted, but will it live and grow? Won't it wither when the east wind strikes it? Won't it wither there where it is growing?" 
26Ezk 17:11 The LORD said to me, 
26Ezk 17:12 "Ask these rebels if they know what the parable means. Tell them that the king of Babylonia came to Jerusalem and took the king and his officials back with him to Babylonia. 
26Ezk 17:13 He took one of the king's family, made a treaty with him, and made him swear to be loyal. He took important men as hostages 
26Ezk 17:14 to keep the nation from rising again and to make sure that the treaty would be kept. 
26Ezk 17:15 But the king of Judah rebelled and sent agents to Egypt to get horses and a large army. Will he succeed? Can he get away with that? He cannot break the treaty and go unpunished! 
26Ezk 17:16 "As surely as I am the living God," says the Sovereign LORD, "this king will die in Babylonia because he broke his oath and the treaty he had made with the king of Babylonia, who put him on the throne. 
26Ezk 17:17 Even the powerful army of the king of Egypt will not be able to help him fight when the Babylonians build earthworks and dig trenches in order to kill many people. 
26Ezk 17:18 He broke his oath and the treaty he had made. He did all these things, and now he will not escape." 
26Ezk 17:19 The Sovereign LORD says, "As surely as I am the living God, I will punish him for breaking the treaty which he swore in my name to keep. 
26Ezk 17:20 I will spread out a hunter's net and catch him in it. I will take him to Babylonia and punish him there, because he was unfaithful to me. 
26Ezk 17:21 His best soldiers will be killed in battle, and the survivors will be scattered in every direction. Then you will know that I, the LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 17:22 This is what the Sovereign LORD says�� "I will take the top of a tall cedar and break off a tender sprout; I will plant it on a high mountain, 
26Ezk 17:23 on Israel's highest mountain. It will grow branches and bear seed and become a magnificent cedar. Birds of every kind will live there and find shelter in its shade. 
26Ezk 17:24 All the trees in the land will know that I am the LORD. I cut down the tall trees and make small trees grow tall. I wither up the green trees and make the dry trees become green. I, the LORD, have spoken. I will do what I have said I would do." 
26Ezk 18:1 The LORD spoke to me 
26Ezk 18:2 and said, "What is this proverb people keep repeating in the land of Israel? 'The parents ate the sour grapes, But the children got the sour taste.' 
26Ezk 18:3 "As surely as I am the living God," says the Sovereign LORD, "you will not repeat this proverb in Israel any more. 
26Ezk 18:4 The life of every person belongs to me, the life of the parent as well as that of the child. The person who sins is the one who will die. 
26Ezk 18:5 "Suppose there is a truly good man, righteous and honest. 
26Ezk 18:6 He doesn't worship the idols of the Israelites or eat the sacrifices offered at forbidden shrines. He doesn't seduce another man's wife or have intercourse with a woman during her period. 
26Ezk 18:7 He doesn't cheat or rob anyone. He returns what a borrower gives him as security; he feeds the hungry and gives clothing to the naked. 
26Ezk 18:8 He doesn't lend money for profit. He refuses to do evil and gives an honest decision in any dispute. 
26Ezk 18:9 Such a man obeys my commands and carefully keeps my laws. He is righteous, and he will live," says the Sovereign LORD. 
26Ezk 18:10 "Then suppose this man has a son who robs and kills, who does any of these things 
26Ezk 18:11 that the father never did. He eats sacrifices offered at forbidden shrines and seduces other men's wives. 
26Ezk 18:12 He cheats the poor, he robs, he keeps what a borrower gives him as security. He goes to pagan shrines, worships disgusting idols, 
26Ezk 18:13 and lends money for profit. Will he live? No, he will not. He has done all these disgusting things, and so he will die. He will be to blame for his own death. 
26Ezk 18:14 "Now suppose this second man has a son. He sees all the sins his father practiced, but does not follow his example. 
26Ezk 18:15 He doesn't worship the idols of the Israelites or eat the sacrifices offered at forbidden shrines. He doesn't seduce another man's wife 
26Ezk 18:16 or oppress anyone or rob anyone. He returns what a borrower gives him as security. He feeds the hungry and gives clothing to the naked. 
26Ezk 18:17 He refuses to do evil and doesn't lend money for profit. He keeps my laws and obeys my commands. He will not die because of his father's sins, but he will certainly live. 
26Ezk 18:18 His father, on the other hand, cheated and robbed and always did evil to everyone. And so he died because of the sins he himself had committed. 
26Ezk 18:19 "But you ask, 'Why shouldn't the son suffer because of his father's sins?' The answer is that the son did what was right and good. He kept my laws and followed them carefully, and so he will certainly live. 
26Ezk 18:20 It is the one who sins who will die. A son is not to suffer because of his father's sins, nor a father because of the sins of his son. Good people will be rewarded for doing good, and evil people will suffer for the evil they do. 
26Ezk 18:21 "If someone evil stops sinning and keeps my laws, if he does what is right and good, he will not die; he will certainly live. 
26Ezk 18:22 All his sins will be forgiven, and he will live, because he did what is right. 
26Ezk 18:23 Do you think I enjoy seeing evil people die?" asks the Sovereign LORD. "No, I would rather see them repent and live. 
26Ezk 18:24 "But if a righteous person stops doing good and starts doing all the evil, disgusting things that evil people do, will he go on living? No! None of the good he did will be remembered. He will die because of his unfaithfulness and his sins. 
26Ezk 18:25 "But you say, 'What the Lord does isn't right.' Listen to me, you Israelites. Do you think my way of doing things isn't right? It is your way that isn't right. 
26Ezk 18:26 When a righteous person stops doing good and starts doing evil and then dies, he dies because of the evil he has done. 
26Ezk 18:27 When someone evil stops sinning and does what is right and good, he saves his life. 
26Ezk 18:28 He realizes what he is doing and stops sinning, so he will certainly not die, but go on living. 
26Ezk 18:29 And you Israelites say, 'What the Lord does isn't right.' You think my way isn't right, do you? It is your way that isn't right. 
26Ezk 18:30 "Now I, the Sovereign LORD, am telling you Israelites that I will judge each of you by what you have done. Turn away from all the evil you are doing, and don't let your sin destroy you. 
26Ezk 18:31 Give up all the evil you have been doing, and get yourselves new minds and hearts. Why do you Israelites want to die? 
26Ezk 18:32 I do not want anyone to die," says the Sovereign LORD. "Turn away from your sins and live." 
26Ezk 19:1 The LORD told me to sing this song of sorrow for two princes of Israel�� 
26Ezk 19:2 What a lioness your mother was! She raised her cubs among the fierce male lions. 
26Ezk 19:3 She raised a cub and taught him to hunt; he learned to eat people. 
26Ezk 19:4 The nations heard about him and trapped him in a pit. With hooks they dragged him off to Egypt. 
26Ezk 19:5 She waited until she saw all hope was gone. Then she raised another of her cubs, and he grew into a fierce lion. 
26Ezk 19:6 When he was full-grown, he prowled with the other lions. He too learned to hunt and eat people. 
26Ezk 19:7 He wrecked forts, he ruined towns. The people of the land were terrified every time he roared. 
26Ezk 19:8 The nations gathered to fight him; people came from everywhere. They spread their hunting nets and caught him in their trap. 
26Ezk 19:9 They put him in a cage and took him to the king of Babylonia. They kept him under guard, so that his roar would never be heard again on the hills of Israel. 
26Ezk 19:10 Your mother was like a grapevine planted near a stream. Because there was plenty of water, the vine was covered with leaves and fruit. 
26Ezk 19:11 Its branches were strong and grew to be royal scepters. The vine grew tall enough to reach the clouds; everyone saw how leafy and tall it was. 
26Ezk 19:12 But angry hands pulled it up by the roots and threw it to the ground. The east wind dried up its fruit. Its branches were broken off; they dried up and were burned. 
26Ezk 19:13 Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and waterless land. 
26Ezk 19:14 The stem of the vine caught fire; fire burned up its branches and fruit. The branches will never again be strong, will never be royal scepters. This is a song of sorrow; it has been sung again and again. 
26Ezk 20:1 It was the tenth day of the fifth month of the seventh year of our exile. Some of the leaders of the Israelite community came to consult me about the LORD's will, and they sat down in front of me. 
26Ezk 20:2 Then the LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 20:3 "Mortal man," he said, "speak to these leaders and tell them that the Sovereign LORD is saying�� You have come to ask my will, have you? As surely as I am the living God, I will not let you ask me anything. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
26Ezk 20:4 "Are you ready to pass sentence on them, mortal man? Then do so. Remind them of the disgusting things their ancestors did. 
26Ezk 20:5 Tell them what I am saying. When I chose Israel, I made them a promise. I revealed myself to them in Egypt and told them�� I am the LORD your God. 
26Ezk 20:6 It was then that I promised to take them out of Egypt and lead them to a land I had chosen for them, a rich and fertile land, the finest land of all. 
26Ezk 20:7 I told them to throw away the disgusting idols they loved and not to make themselves unclean with the false gods of Egypt, because I am the LORD their God. 
26Ezk 20:8 But they defied me and refused to listen. They did not throw away their disgusting idols or give up the Egyptian gods. I was ready to let them feel the full force of my anger there in Egypt. 
26Ezk 20:9 But I did not, since that would have brought dishonor to my name, for in the presence of the people among whom they were living I had announced to Israel that I was going to lead them out of Egypt. 
26Ezk 20:10 "And so I led them out of Egypt into the desert. 
26Ezk 20:11 I gave them my commands and taught them my laws, which bring life to anyone who obeys them. 
26Ezk 20:12 I made the keeping of the Sabbath a sign of the agreement between us, to remind them that I, the LORD, make them holy. 
26Ezk 20:13 But even in the desert they defied me. They broke my laws and rejected my commands, which bring life to anyone who obeys them. They completely profaned the Sabbath. I was ready to let them feel the force of my anger there in the desert and to destroy them. 
26Ezk 20:14 But I did not, since that would have brought dishonor to my name among the nations which had seen me lead Israel out of Egypt. 
26Ezk 20:15 So I made a vow in the desert that I would not take them to the land I had given them, a rich and fertile land, the finest land of all. 
26Ezk 20:16 I made the vow because they had rejected my commands, broken my laws, and profaned the Sabbath - they preferred to worship their idols. 
26Ezk 20:17 "But then I took pity on them. I decided not to kill them there in the desert. 
26Ezk 20:18 Instead, I warned the young people among them�� Do not keep the laws your ancestors made; do not follow their customs or defile yourselves with their idols. 
26Ezk 20:19 I am the LORD your God. Obey my laws and my commands. 
26Ezk 20:20 Make the Sabbath a holy day, so that it will be a sign of the covenant we made, and will remind you that I am the LORD your God. 
26Ezk 20:21 "But that generation also defied me. They broke my laws and did not keep my commands, which bring life to anyone who obeys them. They profaned the Sabbath. I was ready to let them feel the force of my anger there in the desert and to kill them all. 
26Ezk 20:22 But I did not, since that would have brought dishonor to my name among the nations which had seen me bring Israel out of Egypt. 
26Ezk 20:23 So I made another vow in the desert. I vowed that I would scatter them all over the world. 
26Ezk 20:24 I did this because they had rejected my commands, broken my laws, profaned the Sabbath, and worshiped the same idols their ancestors had served. 
26Ezk 20:25 "Then I gave them laws that are not good and commands that do not bring life. 
26Ezk 20:26 I let them defile themselves with their own offerings, and I let them sacrifice their first-born sons. This was to punish them and show them that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 20:27 "Now then, mortal man, tell the Israelites what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying to them. This is another way their ancestors insulted me by their unfaithfulness. 
26Ezk 20:28 I brought them to the land I had promised to give them. When they saw the high hills and green trees, they offered sacrifices at all of them. They made me angry by the sacrifices they burned and by the wine they brought as offerings. 
26Ezk 20:29 I asked them�� What are these high places where you go? So they have been called 'High Places' ever since. 
26Ezk 20:30 Now tell the Israelites what I am saying�� Why must you commit the same sins your ancestors did and go running after their idols? 
26Ezk 20:31 Even today you offer the same gifts and defile yourselves with the same idols by sacrificing your children to them in the fire. And then you Israelites still come to ask what my will is! As surely as I, the Sovereign LORD, am the living God, I will not let you ask me anything. 
26Ezk 20:32 You have made up your minds that you want to be like the other nations, like the people who live in other countries and worship trees and rocks. But that will never be. 
26Ezk 20:33 "As surely as I, the Sovereign LORD, am the living God, I warn you that in my anger I will rule over you with a strong hand, with all my power. 
26Ezk 20:34 I will show you my power and my anger when I gather you together and bring you back from all the countries where you have been scattered. 
26Ezk 20:35 I will bring you into the 'Desert of the Nations,' and there I will condemn you to your face. 
26Ezk 20:36 I will now condemn you just as I condemned your ancestors in the Sinai Desert," says the Sovereign LORD. 
26Ezk 20:37 "I will take firm control of you and make you obey my covenant. 
26Ezk 20:38 I will take away from among you those who are rebellious and sinful. I will take them out of the lands where they are living now, but I will not let them return to the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 20:39 The Sovereign LORD says, "And now, all you Israelites, suit yourselves! Go on and serve your idols! But I warn you that after this you will have to obey me and stop dishonoring my holy name by offering gifts to your idols. 
26Ezk 20:40 There in the land, on my holy mountain, the high mountain of Israel, all you people of Israel will worship me. I will be pleased with you and will expect you to bring me your sacrifices, your best offerings, and your holy gifts. 
26Ezk 20:41 After I bring you out of the countries where you have been scattered and gather you together, I will accept the sacrifices that you burn, and the nations will see that I am holy. 
26Ezk 20:42 When I bring you back to Israel, the land that I promised I would give to your ancestors, then you will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 20:43 Then you will remember all the disgraceful things you did and how you defiled yourselves. You will be disgusted with yourselves because of all the evil things you did. 
26Ezk 20:44 When I act to protect my honor, you Israelites will know that I am the LORD, because I do not deal with you as your wicked, evil actions deserve." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 20:45 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 20:46 "Mortal man," he said, "look toward the south. Speak against the south and prophesy against the forest of the south. 
26Ezk 20:47 Tell the southern forest to hear what the Sovereign LORD is saying�� Look! I am starting a fire, and it will burn up every tree in you, whether green or dry. Nothing will be able to put it out. It will spread from south to north, and everyone will feel the heat of the flames. 
26Ezk 20:48 They will all see that I, the LORD, set it on fire and that no one can put it out." 
26Ezk 20:49 But I protested, "Sovereign LORD, don't make me do it! Everyone is already complaining that I always speak in riddles." 
26Ezk 21:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 21:2 "Mortal man," he said, "denounce Jerusalem. Denounce the places where people worship. Warn the land of Israel 
26Ezk 21:3 that I, the LORD, am saying�� I am your enemy. I will draw my sword and kill all of you, good and evil alike. 
26Ezk 21:4 I will use my sword against everyone from south to north. 
26Ezk 21:5 Everyone will know that I, the LORD, have drawn my sword and that I will not put it away. 
26Ezk 21:6 "Mortal man, groan as if your heart is breaking with despair. Groan in sorrow where everyone can watch you. 
26Ezk 21:7 When they ask you why you are groaning, tell them it is because of the news that is coming. When it comes, their hearts will be filled with fear, their hands will hang limp, their courage will fail, and their knees will tremble. The time has come; it is here." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 21:8 The LORD said to me, 
26Ezk 21:9 "Mortal man, prophesy. Tell the people what I, the Lord, am saying�� A sword, a sword is sharpened and polished. 
26Ezk 21:10 It is sharpened to kill, polished to flash like lightning. There can be no rejoicing, for my people have disregarded every warning and punishment. 
26Ezk 21:11 The sword is being polished, to make it ready for use. It is sharpened and polished, to be put in the hands of a killer. 
26Ezk 21:12 Howl in grief, mortal man; this sword is meant for my people and for all the leaders of Israel. They are going to be killed with all the rest of my people. Beat your breast in despair! 
26Ezk 21:13 I am testing my people, and if they refuse to repent, all these things will happen to them. 
26Ezk 21:14 "Now, mortal man, prophesy. Clap your hands, and the sword will strike again and again. It is a sword that kills, a sword that terrifies and slaughters. 
26Ezk 21:15 It makes my people lose courage and stumble. I am threatening their city with a sword that flashes like lightning and is ready to kill. 
26Ezk 21:16 Cut to the right and the left, you sharp sword! Cut wherever you turn. 
26Ezk 21:17 I also will clap my hands, and my anger will be over. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 21:18 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 21:19 "Mortal man," he said, "mark out two roads by which the king of Babylonia can come with his sword. Both of them are to start in the same country. Put up a signpost where the roads fork. 
26Ezk 21:20 One will show the king the way to the Ammonite city of Rabbah, and the other the way to Judah, to the fortified city, Jerusalem. 
26Ezk 21:21 The king of Babylonia stands by the signpost at the fork of the road. To discover which way to go, he shakes the arrows; he consults his idols; he examines the liver of a sacrificed animal. 
26Ezk 21:22 Now! His right hand holds the arrow marked 'Jerusalem'! It tells him to go and set up battering rams, to shout the battle cry, to place battering rams against the gates, to throw up earthworks, and to dig trenches. 
26Ezk 21:23 The people of Jerusalem won't believe this because of the treaties they have made. But this prediction is to remind them of their sins and to warn them that they will be captured. 
26Ezk 21:24 This then is what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying�� Your sins are exposed. Everyone knows how guilty you are. You show your sins in your every action. You stand condemned, and I will hand you over to your enemies. 
26Ezk 21:25 "You wicked, unholy ruler of Israel, your day, the day of your final punishment, is coming. 
26Ezk 21:26 I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. Take off your crown and your turban. Nothing will be the same again. Raise the poor to power! Bring down those who are ruling! 
26Ezk 21:27 Ruin, ruin! Yes, I will make the city a ruin. But this will not happen until the one comes whom I have chosen to punish the city. To him I will give it. 
26Ezk 21:28 "Mortal man, prophesy. Announce what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying to the Ammonites, who are insulting Israel. Say to them�� 'A sword is ready to destroy; It is polished to kill, to flash like lightning. 
26Ezk 21:29 The visions that you see are false, and the predictions you make are lies. You are wicked and evil, and your day is coming, the day of your final punishment. The sword is going to fall on your necks. 
26Ezk 21:30 " 'Put up the sword! I will judge you in the place where you were created, in the land where you were born. 
26Ezk 21:31 You will feel my anger when I turn it loose on you like a blazing fire. And I will hand you over to brutal men, experts at destruction. 
26Ezk 21:32 You will be destroyed by fire. Your blood will be shed in your own country, and no one will remember you any more.' " The LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 22:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 22:2 "Mortal man," he said, "are you ready to judge the city that is full of murderers? Make clear to her all the disgusting things she has done. 
26Ezk 22:3 Tell the city what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying�� Because you have murdered so many of your own people and have defiled yourself by worshiping idols, your time is coming. 
26Ezk 22:4 You are guilty of those murders and are defiled by the idols you made, and so your day is coming, your time is up! That is why I have let the nations make fun of you and all the countries sneer at you. 
26Ezk 22:5 Countries nearby and countries far away sneer at you because of your lawlessness. 
26Ezk 22:6 All Israel's leaders trust in their own strength and commit murder. 
26Ezk 22:7 None of you in the city honor your parents. You cheat foreigners and take advantage of widows and orphans. 
26Ezk 22:8 You have no respect for the holy places, and you don't keep the Sabbath. 
26Ezk 22:9 Some of your people tell lies about others in order to have them put to death. Some of them eat sacrifices offered to idols. Some are always satisfying their lusts. 
26Ezk 22:10 Some of them sleep with their father's wife. Some force women to have intercourse with them during their period. 
26Ezk 22:11 Some commit adultery, and others seduce their daughters-in-law or their half sisters. 
26Ezk 22:12 Some of your people murder for pay. Some charge interest on the loans they make to other Israelites and get rich by taking advantage of them. They have forgotten me." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 22:13 "I will bring my fist down on your robberies and murders. 
26Ezk 22:14 Do you think you will have any courage left or have strength enough to lift your hand when I am finished with you? I, the LORD, have spoken, and I keep my word. 
26Ezk 22:15 I will scatter your people to every country and nation and will put an end to your evil actions. 
26Ezk 22:16 And so the other nations will dishonor you, but you will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 22:17 The LORD said to me, 
26Ezk 22:18 "Mortal man, the Israelites are of no use to me. They are like waste metal - copper, tin, iron, and lead - left over after silver has been refined in a furnace. 
26Ezk 22:19 So now I, the Sovereign LORD, am telling them that they are just as useless as that. I will bring them all together in Jerusalem 
26Ezk 22:20 in the same way that the ore of silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin is put in a refining furnace. My anger and rage will melt them the way fire melts ore. 
26Ezk 22:21 Yes, I will gather them in Jerusalem, build a fire under them, and melt them with my anger. 
26Ezk 22:22 They will be melted in Jerusalem the way silver is melted in a furnace, and then they will know that they are feeling the anger of the LORD." 
26Ezk 22:23 The LORD spoke to me again. 
26Ezk 22:24 "Mortal man," he said, "tell the Israelites that their land is unholy, and so I am punishing it in my anger. 
26Ezk 22:25 The leaders are like lions roaring over the animals they have killed. They kill the people, take all the money and property they can get, and by their murders leave many widows. 
26Ezk 22:26 The priests break my law and have no respect for what is holy. They make no distinction between what is holy and what is not. They do not teach the difference between clean and unclean things, and they ignore the Sabbath. As a result the people of Israel do not respect me. 
26Ezk 22:27 The government officials are like wolves tearing apart the animals they have killed. They commit murder in order to get rich. 
26Ezk 22:28 The prophets have hidden these sins like workers covering a wall with whitewash. They see false visions and make false predictions. They claim to speak the word of the Sovereign LORD, but I, the LORD, have not spoken to them. 
26Ezk 22:29 The wealthy cheat and rob. They mistreat the poor and take advantage of foreigners. 
26Ezk 22:30 I looked for someone who could build a wall, who could stand in the places where the walls have crumbled and defend the land when my anger is about to destroy it, but I could find no one. 
26Ezk 22:31 So I will turn my anger loose on them, and like a fire I will destroy them for what they have done." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 23:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 23:2 "Mortal man," he said, "there were once two sisters. 
26Ezk 23:3 When they were young, living in Egypt, they lost their virginity and became prostitutes. 
26Ezk 23:4 The older one was named Oholah (she represents Samaria), and the younger one was named Oholibah (she represents Jerusalem). I married both of them, and they bore me children. 
26Ezk 23:5 Although she was mine, Oholah continued to be a prostitute and was full of lust for her lovers from Assyria. 
26Ezk 23:6 They were soldiers in uniforms of purple, noblemen and high-ranking officers; all of them were handsome young cavalry officers. 
26Ezk 23:7 She was the whore for all the Assyrian officers, and her lust led her to defile herself by worshiping Assyrian idols. 
26Ezk 23:8 She continued what she had begun as a prostitute in Egypt, where she lost her virginity. From the time she was a young woman, men slept with her and treated her like a prostitute. 
26Ezk 23:9 So I handed her over to her Assyrian lovers whom she wanted so much. 
26Ezk 23:10 They stripped her naked, seized her sons and daughters, and then killed her with a sword. Women everywhere gossiped about her fate. 
26Ezk 23:11 "Even though her sister Oholibah saw this, she was wilder and more of a prostitute than Oholah had ever been. 
26Ezk 23:12 She too was full of lust for the Assyrian noblemen and officers - soldiers in bright uniforms - and for the cavalry officers, all of those handsome young men. 
26Ezk 23:13 I saw that she was completely immoral, that the second sister was as bad as the first. 
26Ezk 23:14 "She sank deeper and deeper in her immorality. 
26Ezk 23:15 She was attracted by the images of high Babylonian officials carved into the wall and painted bright red, with sashes around their waists and fancy turbans on their heads. 
26Ezk 23:16 As soon as she saw them, she was filled with lust and sent messengers to them in Babylonia. 
26Ezk 23:17 The Babylonians came to have sex with her. They used her and defiled her so much that finally she became disgusted with them. 
26Ezk 23:18 She exposed herself publicly and let everyone know she was a whore. I was as disgusted with her as I had been with her sister. 
26Ezk 23:19 She became more of a prostitute than ever, acting the way she did as a young woman, when she was a prostitute in Egypt. 
26Ezk 23:20 She was filled with lust for oversexed men who had all the lustfulness of donkeys or stallions." 
26Ezk 23:21 (Oholibah, you wanted to repeat the immorality you were guilty of as a young woman in Egypt, where men played with your breasts and you lost your virginity.) 
26Ezk 23:22 "Now then, Oholibah, this is what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying to you. You are tired of those lovers, but I will make them angry with you and bring them to surround you. 
26Ezk 23:23 I will bring all the Babylonians and Chaldeans, men from Pekod, Shoa, and Koa, and all the Assyrians. I will gather all those handsome young noblemen and officers, all those important officials and high-ranking cavalry officers. 
26Ezk 23:24 They will attack you from the north, bringing a large army with chariots and supply wagons. Protected by shields and helmets, they will surround you. I will hand you over to them, and they will judge you by their own laws. 
26Ezk 23:25 Because I am angry with you, I will let them deal with you in their anger. They will cut off your nose and your ears and kill your children. Yes, they will take your sons and daughters from you and burn them alive. 
26Ezk 23:26 They will tear off your clothes and take your jewels. 
26Ezk 23:27 I will put a stop to your lust and to the obscenities you have committed ever since you were in Egypt. You won't look at any more idols or think about Egypt any more." 
26Ezk 23:28 This is what the Sovereign LORD says�� "I will hand you over to people you hate and are disgusted with. 
26Ezk 23:29 And because they hate you, they will take away everything you have worked for and leave you stripped naked, exposed like a prostitute. Your lust and your prostitution 
26Ezk 23:30 have brought this on you. You were a prostitute for the nations and defiled yourself with their idols. 
26Ezk 23:31 You followed in your sister's footsteps, and so I will give you the same cup of punishment to drink." 
26Ezk 23:32 The Sovereign LORD says, "You will drink from your sister's cup; it is large and deep. Everyone will scorn and mock you; the cup is full. 
26Ezk 23:33 It will make you miserable and drunk, that cup of fear and ruin, your sister Samaria's cup. 
26Ezk 23:34 You will drink and drain it dry, and with its broken pieces tear your breast. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 23:35 Now this is what the Sovereign LORD is saying�� "Because you forgot me and turned your back on me, you will suffer for your lust and your prostitution." 
26Ezk 23:36 The LORD said to me, "Mortal man, are you ready to judge Oholah and Oholibah? Accuse them of the disgusting things they have done. 
26Ezk 23:37 They have committed adultery and murder - adultery with idols and murder of the children they bore me. They sacrificed my children to their idols. 
26Ezk 23:38 And that is not all they did. They profaned my Temple and broke the Sabbath, which I had established. 
26Ezk 23:39 The very day that they killed my children as sacrifices to idols, they came to my Temple and profaned it! 
26Ezk 23:40 "Again and again they sent messengers to invite men to come from a great distance, and the men came. The two sisters would bathe and put on eye shadow and jewelry. 
26Ezk 23:41 They would sit on a beautiful couch, and in front of them they would have a table covered with good things, including the incense and the olive oil that I had given them. 
26Ezk 23:42 The sound of a carefree crowd could be heard, a group of men brought in from the desert. They put bracelets on the women's arms and beautiful crowns on their heads. 
26Ezk 23:43 And I said to myself that they were using as a prostitute a woman worn out by adultery. 
26Ezk 23:44 They went back to these prostitutes again and again. They went back to Oholah and Oholibah, those immoral women. 
26Ezk 23:45 Righteous men will condemn them on the charge of adultery and murder, because they practice adultery and their hands are stained with blood." 
26Ezk 23:46 This is what the Sovereign LORD says�� "Bring a mob to terrorize them and rob them. 
26Ezk 23:47 Let the mob stone them and attack them with swords, kill their children, and burn down their houses. 
26Ezk 23:48 Throughout the land I will put a stop to immorality, as a warning to every woman not to commit adultery as they did. 
26Ezk 23:49 And you two sisters - I will punish you for your immorality and your sin of worshiping idols. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign LORD." 
26Ezk 24:1 On the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year of our exile, the LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 24:2 "Mortal man," he said, "write down today's date, because this is the day that the king of Babylonia is beginning the siege of Jerusalem. 
26Ezk 24:3 Tell my rebellious people this parable that I, the Sovereign LORD, have for them�� Set the pot on the fire and fill it up with water. 
26Ezk 24:4 Put in the best pieces of meat - the shoulders and the legs - fill it with choice bony pieces too. 
26Ezk 24:5 Use the meat of the finest sheep; pile the wood under the pot. Let the water boil; boil the bones and the meat." 
26Ezk 24:6 This is what the Sovereign LORD is saying�� "The city of murderers is doomed! It is like a corroded pot that is never cleaned. Piece after piece of meat is taken out, and not one is left. 
26Ezk 24:7 There was murder in the city, but the blood was not spilled on the ground where the dust could hide it; it was spilled on a bare rock. 
26Ezk 24:8 I have left the blood there, where it cannot be hidden, where it demands angry revenge." 
26Ezk 24:9 This is what the Sovereign LORD is saying�� "The city of murderers is doomed! I myself will pile up the firewood. 
26Ezk 24:10 Bring more wood! Fan the flames! Cook the meat! Boil away the broth! Burn up the bones! 
26Ezk 24:11 Now set the empty bronze pot on the coals and let it get red-hot. Then the pot will be ritually pure again after the corrosion is burned off, 
26Ezk 24:12 although all that corrosion will not disappear in the flames. 
26Ezk 24:13 Jerusalem, your immoral actions have defiled you. Although I tried to purify you, you remained defiled. You will not be pure again until you have felt the full force of my anger. 
26Ezk 24:14 I, the LORD, have spoken. The time has come for me to act. I will not ignore your sins or show pity or be merciful. You will be punished for what you have done." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 24:15 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 24:16 "Mortal man," he said, "with one blow I am going to take away the person you love most. You are not to complain or cry or shed any tears. 
26Ezk 24:17 Don't let your sobbing be heard. Do not go bareheaded or barefoot as a sign of mourning. Don't cover your face or eat the food that mourners eat." 
26Ezk 24:18 Early in the day I was talking with the people. That evening my wife died, and the next day I did as I had been told. 
26Ezk 24:19 The people asked me, "Why are you acting like this?" 
26Ezk 24:20 So I said to them, "The LORD spoke to me and told me 
26Ezk 24:21 to give you Israelites this message�� You are proud of the strength of the Temple. You like to look at it and to visit it, but the LORD is going to profane it. And the younger members of your families who are left in Jerusalem will be killed in war. 
26Ezk 24:22 Then you will do what I have done. You will not cover your faces or eat the food that mourners eat. 
26Ezk 24:23 You will not go bareheaded or barefoot or mourn or cry. You will waste away because of your sins, and you will groan to one another. 
26Ezk 24:24 Then I will be a sign to you; you will do everything I have done. The LORD says that when this happens, you will know that he is the Sovereign LORD." 
26Ezk 24:25 The LORD said, "Now, mortal man, I will take away from them the strong Temple that was their pride and joy, which they liked to look at and to visit. And I will take away their sons and daughters. 
26Ezk 24:26 On the day that I do this, some who escape the destruction will come and tell you about it. 
26Ezk 24:27 That same day you will get back the power of speech which you had lost, and you will talk with them. In this way you will be a sign to the people, and they will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 25:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 25:2 "Mortal man," he said, "denounce the country of Ammon. 
26Ezk 25:3 Tell them to listen to what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying�� You were delighted to see my Temple profaned, to see the land of Israel devastated, to see the people of Judah go into exile. 
26Ezk 25:4 Because you were glad, I will let the tribes from the eastern desert conquer you. They will set up their camps in your country and settle there. They will eat the fruit and drink the milk that should have been yours. 
26Ezk 25:5 I will turn the city of Rabbah into a place to keep camels, and the whole country of Ammon will become a place to keep sheep, so that you will know I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 25:6 "This is what the Sovereign LORD is saying�� You clapped your hands and jumped for joy. You despised the land of Israel. 
26Ezk 25:7 Because you did, I will hand you over to other nations who will rob you and plunder you. I will destroy you so completely that you will not be a nation any more or have a country of your own. Then you will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 25:8 The Sovereign LORD said, "Because Moab has said that Judah is like all the other nations, 
26Ezk 25:9 I will let the cities that defend the border of Moab be attacked, including even the finest cities - Beth Jeshimoth, Baal Meon, and Kiriathaim. 
26Ezk 25:10 I will let the tribes of the eastern desert conquer Moab, together with Ammon, so that Moab will no longer be a nation. 
26Ezk 25:11 I will punish Moab, and they will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 25:12 The Sovereign LORD said, "The people of Edom took cruel revenge on Judah, and that revenge has brought lasting guilt on Edom. 
26Ezk 25:13 Now I announce that I will punish Edom and kill every person and animal there. I will make it a wasteland, from the city of Teman to the city of Dedan, and the people will be killed in battle. 
26Ezk 25:14 My people Israel will take revenge on Edom for me, and they will make Edom feel my furious anger. Edom will know what it means to be the object of my revenge." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 25:15 The Sovereign LORD said, "The Philistines have taken cruel revenge on their agelong enemies and destroyed them in their hate. 
26Ezk 25:16 And so I am announcing that I will attack the Philistines and wipe them out. I will destroy everyone left living there on the Philistine Plain. 
26Ezk 25:17 I will punish them severely and take full revenge on them. They will feel my anger. Then they will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 26:1 On the first day of the...month of the eleventh year of our exile, the LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 26:2 "Mortal man," he said, "this is what the people in the city of Tyre are cheering about. They shout, 'Jerusalem is shattered! Her commercial power is gone! She won't be our rival any more!' 
26Ezk 26:3 "Now then, this is what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying�� I am your enemy, city of Tyre. I will bring many nations to attack you, and they will come like the waves of the sea. 
26Ezk 26:4 They will destroy your city walls and tear down your towers. Then I will sweep away all the dust and leave only a bare rock. 
26Ezk 26:5 Fishermen will dry their nets on it, there where it stands in the sea. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. The nations will plunder Tyre, 
26Ezk 26:6 and with their swords they will kill those who live in her towns on the mainland. Then Tyre will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 26:7 The Sovereign LORD says, "I am going to bring the greatest king of all - King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia - to attack Tyre. He will come from the north with a huge army, with horses and chariots and with cavalry. 
26Ezk 26:8 Those who live in the towns on the mainland will be killed in the fighting. The enemy will dig trenches, build earthworks, and make a solid wall of shields against you. 
26Ezk 26:9 They will pound in your walls with battering rams and tear down your towers with iron bars. 
26Ezk 26:10 The clouds of dust raised by their horses will cover you. The noise of their horses pulling wagons and chariots will shake your walls as they pass through the gates of the ruined city. 
26Ezk 26:11 Their cavalry will storm through your streets, killing your people with their swords. Your mighty pillars will be thrown to the ground. 
26Ezk 26:12 Your enemies will help themselves to your wealth and merchandise. They will pull down your walls and shatter your luxurious houses. They will take the stones and wood and all the rubble, and dump them into the sea. 
26Ezk 26:13 I will put an end to all your songs, and I will silence the music of your harps. 
26Ezk 26:14 I will leave only a bare rock where fishermen can dry their nets. The city will never be rebuilt. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 26:15 The Sovereign LORD has this to say to the city of Tyre�� "When you are being conquered, the people who live along the coast will be terrified at the screams of those who are slaughtered. 
26Ezk 26:16 All the kings of the seafaring nations will come down from their thrones. They will take off their robes and their embroidered clothes and sit trembling on the ground. They will be so terrified at your fate that they will not be able to stop trembling. 
26Ezk 26:17 They will sing this funeral song for you�� The famous city is destroyed! Her ships have been swept from the seas. The people of this city ruled the seas And terrified all who lived on the coast. 
26Ezk 26:18 Now, on the day it has fallen, The islands are trembling, And their people are shocked at such destruction." 
26Ezk 26:19 The Sovereign LORD says�� "I will make you as desolate as ruined cities where no one lives. I will cover you with the water of the ocean depths. 
26Ezk 26:20 I will send you down to the world of the dead to join the people who lived in ancient times. I will make you stay in that underground world among eternal ruins, keeping company with the dead. As a result you will never again be inhabited and take your place in the land of the living. 
26Ezk 26:21 I will make you a terrifying example, and that will be the end of you. People may look for you, but you will never be found." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 27:1 The LORD said to me, 
26Ezk 27:2 "Mortal man, sing a funeral song for Tyre, 
26Ezk 27:3 that city which stands at the edge of the sea and does business with the people living on every seacoast. Tell her what the Sovereign LORD is saying�� "Tyre, you boasted of your perfect beauty. 
26Ezk 27:4 Your home is the sea. Your builders made you like a beautiful ship; 
26Ezk 27:5 They used fir trees from Mount Hermon for timber And a cedar from Lebanon for your mast. 
26Ezk 27:6 They took oak trees from Bashan to make oars; They made your deck out of pine from Cyprus And inlaid it with ivory. 
26Ezk 27:7 Your sails were made of linen, Embroidered linen from Egypt, Easily recognized from afar. Your awnings were made of finest cloth, Of purple from the island of Cyprus. 
26Ezk 27:8 Your oarsmen were from the cities of Sidon and Arvad. Your own skillful men were the sailors. 
26Ezk 27:9 The ship's carpenters Were well-trained men from Byblos. Sailors from every seagoing ship Did business in your shops. 
26Ezk 27:10 "Soldiers from Persia, Lydia, and Libya served in your army. They hung their shields and their helmets in your barracks. They are the men who won glory for you. 
26Ezk 27:11 Soldiers from Arvad guarded your walls, and troops from Gamad guarded your towers. They hung their shields on your walls. They are the ones who made you beautiful. 
26Ezk 27:12 "You did business in Spain and took silver, iron, tin, and lead in payment for your abundant goods. 
26Ezk 27:13 You did business in Greece, Tubal, and Meshech and traded your goods for slaves and for articles of bronze. 
26Ezk 27:14 You sold your goods for workhorses, war-horses, and mules from Beth Togarmah. 
26Ezk 27:15 The people of Rhodes traded with you; people of many coastal lands gave you ivory and ebony in exchange for your goods. 
26Ezk 27:16 The people of Syria bought your merchandise and your many products. They gave emeralds, purple cloth, embroidery, fine linen, coral, and rubies in payment for your wares. 
26Ezk 27:17 Judah and Israel paid for your goods with wheat, honey, olive oil, and spices. 
26Ezk 27:18 The people of Damascus bought your merchandise and your products, paying for them with wine from Helbon and wool from Sahar. 
26Ezk 27:19 They traded wrought iron and spices for your goods. 
26Ezk 27:20 The people of Dedan traded saddle blankets for your goods. 
26Ezk 27:21 The Arabians and the rulers of the land of Kedar paid for your merchandise with lambs, sheep, and goats. 
26Ezk 27:22 For your goods the merchants of Sheba and Raamah traded jewels, gold, and the finest spices. 
26Ezk 27:23 The cities of Haran, Canneh, and Eden, the merchants of Sheba, the cities of Asshur and Chilmad - they all traded with you. 
26Ezk 27:24 They sold you luxurious clothing, purple cloth, and embroidery, brightly colored carpets, and well-made cords and ropes. 
26Ezk 27:25 Your merchandise was carried in fleets of the largest cargo ships. "You were like a ship at sea Loaded with heavy cargo. 
26Ezk 27:26 When your oarsmen brought you out to sea, An east wind wrecked you far from land. 
26Ezk 27:27 All your wealth of merchandise, All the sailors in your crew, Your ship's carpenters and your merchants, Every soldier on board the ship - All, all were lost at sea When your ship was wrecked. 
26Ezk 27:28 The shouts of the drowning sailors Echoed on the shore. 
26Ezk 27:29 "Every ship is now deserted, And every sailor has gone ashore. 
26Ezk 27:30 They all mourn bitterly for you, Throwing dust on their heads and rolling in ashes. 
26Ezk 27:31 They shave their heads for you And dress themselves in sackcloth. Their hearts are bitter as they weep. 
26Ezk 27:32 They chant a funeral song for you�� 'Who can be compared to Tyre, To Tyre now silent in the sea? 
26Ezk 27:33 When your merchandise went overseas, You filled the needs of every nation. Kings were made rich By the wealth of your goods. 
26Ezk 27:34 Now you are wrecked in the sea; You have sunk to the ocean depths. Your goods and all who worked for you Have vanished with you in the sea.' 
26Ezk 27:35 "Everyone who lives along the coast is shocked at your fate. Even their kings are terrified, and fear is written on their faces. 
26Ezk 27:36 You are gone, gone forever, and merchants all over the world are terrified, afraid that they will share your fate." 
26Ezk 28:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 28:2 "Mortal man," he said, "tell the ruler of Tyre what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying to him�� Puffed up with pride, you claim to be a god. You say that like a god you sit on a throne, surrounded by the seas. You may pretend to be a god, but, no, you are mortal, not divine. 
26Ezk 28:3 You think you are wiser than Danel, that no secret can be kept from you. 
26Ezk 28:4 Your wisdom and skill made you rich with treasures of gold and silver. 
26Ezk 28:5 You made clever business deals and kept on making profits. How proud you are of your wealth! 
26Ezk 28:6 "Now then, this is what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying�� Because you think you are as wise as a god, 
26Ezk 28:7 I will bring ruthless enemies to attack you. They will destroy all the beautiful things you have acquired by skill and wisdom. 
26Ezk 28:8 They will kill you and send you to a watery grave. 
26Ezk 28:9 When they come to kill you, will you still claim that you are a god? When you face your murderers, you will be mortal and not at all divine. 
26Ezk 28:10 You will die like a dog at the hand of godless foreigners. I, the Sovereign LORD, have given the command." 
26Ezk 28:11 The LORD spoke to me again. 
26Ezk 28:12 "Mortal man," he said, "grieve for the fate that is waiting for the king of Tyre. Tell him what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying�� You were once an example of perfection. How wise and handsome you were! 
26Ezk 28:13 You lived in Eden, the garden of God, and wore gems of every kind�� rubies and diamonds; topaz, beryl, carnelian, and jasper; sapphires, emeralds, and garnets. You had ornaments of gold. They were made for you on the day you were created. 
26Ezk 28:14 I put a terrifying angel there to guard you. You lived on my holy mountain and walked among sparkling gems. 
26Ezk 28:15 Your conduct was perfect from the day you were created until you began to do evil. 
26Ezk 28:16 You were busy buying and selling, and this led you to violence and sin. So I forced you to leave my holy mountain, and the angel who guarded you drove you away from the sparkling gems. 
26Ezk 28:17 You were proud of being handsome, and your fame made you act like a fool. Because of this I hurled you to the ground and left you as a warning to other kings. 
26Ezk 28:18 You did such evil in buying and selling that your places of worship were corrupted. So I set fire to the city and burned it to the ground. All who look at you now see you reduced to ashes. 
26Ezk 28:19 You are gone, gone forever, and all the nations that had come to know you are terrified, afraid that they will share your fate." 
26Ezk 28:20 The LORD said to me, 
26Ezk 28:21 "Mortal man, denounce the city of Sidon. 
26Ezk 28:22 Tell the people there what I, the Sovereign LORD, say about them�� I am your enemy, Sidon; people will praise me because of what I do to you. They will know that I am the LORD, when I show how holy I am by punishing those who live in you. 
26Ezk 28:23 I will send diseases on you and make blood flow in your streets. You will be attacked from every side, and your people will be killed. Then you will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 28:24 The LORD said, "None of the surrounding nations that treated Israel with scorn will ever again be like thorns and briers to hurt Israel. And they will know that I am the Sovereign LORD." 
26Ezk 28:25 The Sovereign LORD said, "I will bring back the people of Israel from the nations where I scattered them, and all the nations will know that I am holy. The people of Israel will live in their own land, the land that I gave to my servant Jacob. 
26Ezk 28:26 They will live there in safety. They will build houses and plant vineyards. I will punish all their neighbors who treated them with scorn, and Israel will be secure. Then they will know that I am the LORD their God." 
26Ezk 29:1 On the twelfth day of the tenth month of the tenth year of our exile, the LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 29:2 "Mortal man," he said, "denounce the king of Egypt. Tell him how he and all the land of Egypt will be punished. 
26Ezk 29:3 Say that this is what the Sovereign LORD is telling the king of Egypt�� I am your enemy, you monster crocodile, lying in the river. You say that the Nile is yours and that you made it. 
26Ezk 29:4 I am going to put a hook through your jaw and make the fish in your river stick fast to you. Then I will pull you up out of the Nile, with all the fish sticking to you. 
26Ezk 29:5 I will throw you and all those fish into the desert. Your body will fall on the ground and be left unburied. I will give it to the birds and animals for food. 
26Ezk 29:6 Then all the people of Egypt will know that I am the LORD." The LORD says, "The Israelites relied on you Egyptians for support, but you were no better than a weak stick. 
26Ezk 29:7 When they leaned on you, you broke, pierced their armpits, and made them wrench their backs. 
26Ezk 29:8 Now then, I, the Sovereign LORD, am telling you that I will have troops attack you with swords, and they will kill your people and your animals. 
26Ezk 29:9 Egypt will become an empty wasteland. Then you will know that I am the LORD. "Because you said that the Nile is yours and you made it, 
26Ezk 29:10 I am your enemy and the enemy of your Nile. I will make all of Egypt an empty wasteland, from the city of Migdol in the north to the city of Aswan in the south, all the way to the Ethiopian border. 
26Ezk 29:11 No human being or animal will walk through it. For forty years nothing will live there. 
26Ezk 29:12 I will make Egypt the most desolate country in the world. For forty years the cities of Egypt will lie in ruins, ruins worse than those of any other city. I will make the Egyptians refugees. They will flee to every country and live among other peoples." 
26Ezk 29:13 The Sovereign LORD says, "After forty years I will bring the Egyptians back from the nations where I have scattered them, 
26Ezk 29:14 and I will let them live in southern Egypt, their original home. There they will be a weak kingdom, 
26Ezk 29:15 the weakest kingdom of all, and they will never again rule other nations. I will make them so unimportant that they will not be able to bend any other nation to their will. 
26Ezk 29:16 Israel will never again depend on them for help. Egypt's fate will remind Israel how wrong it was to rely on them. Then Israel will know that I am the Sovereign LORD." 
26Ezk 29:17 On the first day of the first month of the twenty-seventh year of our exile, the LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 29:18 "Mortal man," he said, "King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia launched an attack on Tyre. He made his soldiers carry such heavy loads that their heads were rubbed bald and their shoulders were worn raw, but neither the king nor his army got anything for all their trouble. 
26Ezk 29:19 So now this is what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying�� I am giving the land of Egypt to King Nebuchadnezzar. He will loot and plunder it and carry off all the wealth of Egypt as his army's pay. 
26Ezk 29:20 I am giving him Egypt in payment for his services, because his army was working for me. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
26Ezk 29:21 "When that happens, I will make the people of Israel strong and let you, Ezekiel, speak out where everyone can hear you, so that they will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 30:1 The LORD spoke to me again. 
26Ezk 30:2 "Mortal man," he said, "prophesy and announce what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying. You are to shout these words�� A day of terror is coming! 
26Ezk 30:3 The day is near, the day when the LORD will act, A day of clouds and trouble for the nations. 
26Ezk 30:4 There will be war in Egypt And great distress in Ethiopia. Many in Egypt will be killed; The country will be plundered And left in ruins. 
26Ezk 30:5 "That war will also kill the soldiers hired from Ethiopia, Libya, Lydia, Arabia, Kub, and even from among my own people." 
26Ezk 30:6 The LORD says, "From Migdol in the north to Aswan in the south, all Egypt's defenders will be killed in battle. Egypt's proud army will be destroyed. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
26Ezk 30:7 The land will be the most desolate in the world, and its cities will be left totally in ruins. 
26Ezk 30:8 When I set fire to Egypt and all her defenders are killed, then they will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 30:9 "When that day comes and Egypt is destroyed, I will send messengers in ships to arouse the unsuspecting people of Ethiopia, and they will be terrified. That day is coming!" 
26Ezk 30:10 The Sovereign LORD says, "I will use King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia to put an end to Egypt's wealth. 
26Ezk 30:11 He and his ruthless army will come to devastate the land. They will attack Egypt with swords, and the land will be full of corpses. 
26Ezk 30:12 I will dry up the Nile and put Egypt under the power of evil people. Foreigners will devastate the whole country. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 30:13 The Sovereign LORD says, "I will destroy the idols and the false gods in Memphis. There will be no one to rule Egypt, and I will terrify all the people. 
26Ezk 30:14 I will make southern Egypt desolate and set fire to the city of Zoan in the north. I will punish the capital city of Thebes. 
26Ezk 30:15 I will let the city of Pelusium, Egypt's great fortress, feel my fury. I will destroy the wealth of Thebes. 
26Ezk 30:16 I will set fire to Egypt, and Pelusium will be in agony. The walls of Thebes will be broken down, and the city will be flooded. 
26Ezk 30:17 The young men of the cities of Heliopolis and Bubastis will die in the war, and the other people will be taken prisoner. 
26Ezk 30:18 Darkness will fall on Tahpanhes when I break the power of Egypt and put an end to the strength they were so proud of. A cloud will cover Egypt, and the people of all her cities will be taken prisoner. 
26Ezk 30:19 When I punish Egypt in this way, they will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 30:20 On the seventh day of the first month of the eleventh year of our exile, the LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 30:21 "Mortal man," he said, "I have broken the arm of the king of Egypt. No one has bandaged it or put it in a sling so that it could heal and be strong enough to hold a sword again. 
26Ezk 30:22 Now then, this is what I, the Sovereign LORD, say�� I am the enemy of the king of Egypt. I am going to break both his arms - the good one and the one already broken - and the sword will fall from his hand. 
26Ezk 30:23 I am going to scatter the Egyptians throughout the world. 
26Ezk 30:24 Then I will make the arms of the king of Babylonia strong and put my sword in his hands. But I will break the arms of the king of Egypt, and he will groan and die in front of his enemy. 
26Ezk 30:25 Yes, I will weaken him and strengthen the king of Babylonia. When I give him my sword and he points it toward Egypt, everyone will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 30:26 I will scatter the Egyptians throughout the world. Then they will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 31:1 On the first day of the third month of the eleventh year of our exile, the LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 31:2 "Mortal man," he said, "say to the king of Egypt and all his people�� How powerful you are! What can I compare you to? 
26Ezk 31:3 You are like a cedar in Lebanon, With beautiful, shady branches, A tree so tall it reaches the clouds. 
26Ezk 31:4 There was water to make it grow, And underground rivers to feed it. They watered the place where the tree was growing And sent streams to all the trees of the forest. 
26Ezk 31:5 Because it was well-watered, It grew taller than other trees. Its branches grew thick and long. 
26Ezk 31:6 Every kind of bird built nests in its branches; The wild animals bore their young in its shelter; The nations of the world rested in its shade. 
26Ezk 31:7 How beautiful the tree was - So tall, with such long branches. Its roots reached down to the deep-flowing streams. 
26Ezk 31:8 No cedar in God's garden could compare with it. No fir tree ever had such branches, And no plane tree such limbs. No tree in God's own garden was so beautiful. 
26Ezk 31:9 I made it beautiful, with spreading branches. It was the envy of every tree in Eden, the garden of God. 
26Ezk 31:10 "Now then, I, the Sovereign LORD, will tell you what is going to happen to that tree that grew until it reached the clouds. As it grew taller it grew proud; 
26Ezk 31:11 so I have rejected it and will let a foreign ruler have it. He will give that tree what it deserves for its wickedness. 
26Ezk 31:12 Ruthless foreigners will cut it down and leave it. Its branches and broken limbs will fall on every mountain and valley in the country. All the nations that have been living in its shade will go away. 
26Ezk 31:13 The birds will come and perch on the fallen tree, and the wild animals will walk over its branches. 
26Ezk 31:14 And so from now on, no tree, no matter how well-watered it is, will grow that tall again or push its top through the clouds and reach such a height. All of them are doomed to die like mortals, doomed to join those who go down to the world of the dead." 
26Ezk 31:15 This is what the Sovereign LORD says�� "On the day when the tree goes to the world of the dead, I will make the underground waters cover it as a sign of mourning. I will hold back the rivers and not let the many streams flow out. Because the tree has died, I will bring darkness over the Lebanon Mountains and make all the trees of the forest wither. 
26Ezk 31:16 When I send it down to the world of the dead, the noise of its downfall will shake the nations. All the trees of Eden and all the choice, well-watered trees of Lebanon who have gone to the world below will be pleased at its downfall. 
26Ezk 31:17 They will go with it to the world of the dead to join those that have already fallen. And all who live under its shadow will be scattered among the nations. 
26Ezk 31:18 "The tree is the king of Egypt and all his people. Not even the trees in Eden were so tall and impressive. But now, like the trees of Eden, it will go down to the world of the dead and join the ungodly and those killed in battle. I have spoken," says the Sovereign LORD. 
26Ezk 32:1 On the first day of the twelfth month of the twelfth year of our exile, the LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 32:2 "Mortal man," he said, "give a solemn warning to the king of Egypt. Give him this message from me�� You act like a lion among the nations, but you are more like a crocodile splashing through a river. You muddy the water with your feet and pollute the rivers. 
26Ezk 32:3 When many nations gather, I will catch you in my net and let them drag the net ashore. 
26Ezk 32:4 I will throw you out on the ground and bring all the birds and animals of the world to feed on you. 
26Ezk 32:5 I will cover mountains and valleys with your rotting corpse. 
26Ezk 32:6 I will pour out your blood until it spreads over the mountains and fills the streams. 
26Ezk 32:7 When I destroy you, I will cover the sky and blot out the stars. The sun will hide behind the clouds, and the moon will give no light. 
26Ezk 32:8 I will put out all the lights of heaven and plunge your world into darkness. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
26Ezk 32:9 "Many nations will be troubled when I spread the news of your destruction through countries you never heard of. 
26Ezk 32:10 What I do to you will shock many nations. When I swing my sword, kings will shudder with fright. On the day you fall, all of them will tremble in fear for their own lives." 
26Ezk 32:11 The Sovereign LORD says to the king of Egypt, "You will face the sword of the king of Babylonia. 
26Ezk 32:12 I will let soldiers from cruel nations draw their swords and kill all your people. All your people and everything else that you are proud of will be destroyed. 
26Ezk 32:13 I will slaughter your cattle at every water hole. There will be no people or cattle to muddy the water any more. 
26Ezk 32:14 I will let your waters settle and become clear and let your rivers run calm. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
26Ezk 32:15 When I make Egypt a desolate wasteland and destroy all who live there, they will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 32:16 This solemn warning will become a funeral song. The women of the nations will sing it to mourn for Egypt and all its people. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 32:17 On the fifteenth day of the first month of the twelfth year of our exile, the LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 32:18 "Mortal man," he said, "mourn for all the many people of Egypt. Send them down with the other powerful nations to the world of the dead. 
26Ezk 32:19 Say to them�� "Do you think you are more beautiful than anyone else? You will go down to the world of the dead and lie there among the ungodly. 
26Ezk 32:20 "The people of Egypt will fall with those who are killed in battle. A sword is ready to kill them all. 
26Ezk 32:21 The greatest heroes and those who fought on the Egyptian side welcome the Egyptians to the world of the dead. They shout�� 'The ungodly who were killed in battle have come down here, and here they lie!' 
26Ezk 32:22 "Assyria is there, with the graves of her soldiers all around. They were all killed in battle, 
26Ezk 32:23 and their graves are in the deepest parts of the world of the dead. All her soldiers fell in battle, and their graves surround her tomb. Yet once they terrified the land of the living. 
26Ezk 32:24 "Elam is there, with the graves of her soldiers all around. They were all killed in battle, and they went down, uncircumcised, to the world of the dead. In life they spread terror, but now they lie dead and disgraced. 
26Ezk 32:25 Elam lies down among those killed in battle, and the graves of her soldiers are all around her. They are all uncircumcised, all killed in battle. In life they spread terror, but now they lie dead and disgraced, sharing the fate of those killed in battle. 
26Ezk 32:26 "Meshech and Tubal are there, with the graves of their soldiers all around. They are all uncircumcised, all killed in battle. Yet once they terrified the living. 
26Ezk 32:27 They were not given honorable burial like the heroes of ancient times, who went fully armed to the world of the dead, their swords placed under their heads and their shields over their bodies. These heroes were once powerful enough to terrify the living. 
26Ezk 32:28 "That is how the Egyptians will lie crushed among the uncircumcised who were killed in battle. 
26Ezk 32:29 "Edom is there with her kings and rulers. They were powerful soldiers, but now they lie in the world of the dead with the uncircumcised who were killed in battle. 
26Ezk 32:30 "All the princes of the north are there, and so are the Sidonians. Their power once spread terror, but now they go down in disgrace with those killed in battle and are laid to rest, uncircumcised. They share the disgrace of those who go down to the world of the dead. 
26Ezk 32:31 "The sight of all these who were killed in battle will be a comfort to the king of Egypt and his army," says the Sovereign LORD. 
26Ezk 32:32 "I caused the king of Egypt to terrorize the living, but he and all his army will be killed and laid to rest with all the uncircumcised who die in battle." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 33:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 33:2 "Mortal man," he said, "tell your people what happens when I bring war to a land. The people of that country choose one of their number to be a lookout. 
26Ezk 33:3 When he sees the enemy approaching, he sounds the alarm to warn everyone. 
26Ezk 33:4 If someone hears it but pays no attention and the enemy comes and kills him, then he is to blame for his own death. 
26Ezk 33:5 His death is his own fault, because he paid no attention to the warning. If he had paid attention, he could have escaped. 
26Ezk 33:6 If, however, the lookout sees the enemy coming and does not sound the alarm, the enemy will come and kill those sinners, but I will hold the lookout responsible for their death. 
26Ezk 33:7 "Now, mortal man, I am making you a lookout for the nation of Israel. You must pass on to them the warnings I give you. 
26Ezk 33:8 If I announce that an evil person is going to die but you do not warn him to change his ways so that he can save his life, then he will die, still a sinner, and I will hold you responsible for his death. 
26Ezk 33:9 If you do warn an evil person and he doesn't stop sinning, he will die, still a sinner, but your life will be spared." 
26Ezk 33:10 The LORD spoke to me. "Mortal man," he said, "repeat to the Israelites what they are saying�� 'We are burdened with our sins and the wrongs we have done. We are wasting away. How can we live?' 
26Ezk 33:11 Tell them that as surely as I, the Sovereign LORD, am the living God, I do not enjoy seeing sinners die. I would rather see them stop sinning and live. Israel, stop the evil you are doing. Why do you want to die? 
26Ezk 33:12 "Now, mortal man, tell the Israelites that when someone good sins, the good he has done will not save him. If an evil person stops doing evil, he won't be punished, and if a good man starts sinning, his life will not be spared. 
26Ezk 33:13 I may promise life to someone good, but if he starts thinking that his past goodness is enough and begins to sin, I will not remember any of the good he did. He will die because of his sins. 
26Ezk 33:14 I may warn someone evil that he is going to die, but if he stops sinning and does what is right and good - 
26Ezk 33:15 for example, if he returns the security he took for a loan or gives back what he stole - if he stops sinning and follows the laws that give life, he will not die, but live. 
26Ezk 33:16 I will forgive the sins he has committed, and he will live because he has done what is right and good. 
26Ezk 33:17 "And your people say that what I do isn't right! No, it's their way that isn't right. 
26Ezk 33:18 When someone righteous stops doing good and starts doing evil, he will die for it. 
26Ezk 33:19 When someone evil quits sinning and does what is right and good, he has saved his life. 
26Ezk 33:20 But Israel, you say that what I do isn't right. I am going to judge you by what you do." 
26Ezk 33:21 On the fifth day of the tenth month of the twelfth year of our exile, someone who had escaped from Jerusalem came and told me that the city had fallen. 
26Ezk 33:22 The evening before he came, I had felt the powerful presence of the LORD. When the man arrived the next morning, the LORD gave me back the power of speech. 
26Ezk 33:23 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 33:24 "Mortal man," he said, "the people who are living in the ruined cities of the land of Israel are saying�� 'Abraham was only one man, and he was given the whole land. There are many of us, so now the land is ours.' 
26Ezk 33:25 "Tell them what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying�� You eat meat with the blood still in it. You worship idols. You commit murder. What makes you think that the land belongs to you? 
26Ezk 33:26 You rely on your swords. Your actions are disgusting. Everyone commits adultery. What makes you think that the land is yours? 
26Ezk 33:27 "Tell them that I, the Sovereign LORD, warn them that as surely as I am the living God, the people who live in the ruined cities will be killed. Those living in the country will be eaten by wild animals. Those hiding in the mountains and in caves will die of disease. 
26Ezk 33:28 I will make the country a desolate wasteland, and the power they were so proud of will come to an end. The mountains of Israel will be so wild that no one will be able to travel through them. 
26Ezk 33:29 When I punish the people for their sins and make the country a wasteland, then they will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 33:30 The LORD said, "Mortal man, your people are talking about you when they meet by the city walls or in the doorways of their houses. They say to one another, 'Let's go and hear what word has come from the LORD now.' 
26Ezk 33:31 So my people crowd in to hear what you have to say, but they don't do what you tell them to do. Loving words are on their lips, but they continue their greedy ways. 
26Ezk 33:32 To them you are nothing more than an entertainer singing love songs or playing a harp. They listen to all your words and don't obey a single one of them. 
26Ezk 33:33 But when all your words come true - and they will come true - then they will know that a prophet has been among them." 
26Ezk 34:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 34:2 "Mortal man," he said, "denounce the rulers of Israel. Prophesy to them, and tell them what I, the Sovereign LORD, say to them�� You are doomed, you shepherds of Israel! You take care of yourselves, but never tend the sheep. 
26Ezk 34:3 You drink the milk, wear clothes made from the wool, and kill and eat the finest sheep. But you never tend the sheep. 
26Ezk 34:4 You have not taken care of the weak ones, healed the ones that are sick, bandaged the ones that are hurt, brought back the ones that wandered off, or looked for the ones that were lost. Instead, you treated them cruelly. 
26Ezk 34:5 Because the sheep had no shepherd, they were scattered, and wild animals killed and ate them. 
26Ezk 34:6 So my sheep wandered over the high hills and the mountains. They were scattered over the face of the earth, and no one looked for them or tried to find them. 
26Ezk 34:7 "Now, you shepherds, listen to what I, the LORD, am telling you. 
26Ezk 34:8 As surely as I am the living God, you had better listen to me. My sheep have been attacked by wild animals that killed and ate them because there was no shepherd. My shepherds did not try to find the sheep. They were taking care of themselves and not the sheep. 
26Ezk 34:9 So listen to me, you shepherds. 
26Ezk 34:10 I, the Sovereign LORD, declare that I am your enemy. I will take my sheep away from you and never again let you be their shepherds; never again will I let you take care only of yourselves. I will rescue my sheep from you and not let you eat them. 
26Ezk 34:11 "I, the Sovereign LORD, tell you that I myself will look for my sheep and take care of them 
26Ezk 34:12 in the same way as shepherds take care of their sheep that were scattered and are brought together again. I will bring them back from all the places where they were scattered on that dark, disastrous day. 
26Ezk 34:13 I will take them out of foreign countries, gather them together, and bring them back to their own land. I will lead them back to the mountains and the streams of Israel and will feed them in pleasant pastures. 
26Ezk 34:14 I will let them graze in safety in the mountain meadows and the valleys and in all the green pastures of the land of Israel. 
26Ezk 34:15 I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will find them a place to rest. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
26Ezk 34:16 "I will look for those that are lost, bring back those that wander off, bandage those that are hurt, and heal those that are sick; but those that are fat and strong I will destroy, because I am a shepherd who does what is right. 
26Ezk 34:17 "Now then, my flock, I, the Sovereign LORD, tell you that I will judge each of you and separate the good from the bad, the sheep from the goats. 
26Ezk 34:18 Some of you are not satisfied with eating the best grass; you even trample down what you don't eat! You drink the clear water and muddy what you don't drink! 
26Ezk 34:19 My other sheep have to eat the grass you trample down and drink the water you muddy. 
26Ezk 34:20 "So now, I, the Sovereign LORD, tell you that I will judge between you strong sheep and the weak sheep. 
26Ezk 34:21 You pushed the sick ones aside and butted them away from the flock. 
26Ezk 34:22 But I will rescue my sheep and not let them be mistreated any more. I will judge each of my sheep and separate the good from the bad. 
26Ezk 34:23 I will give them a king like my servant David to be their one shepherd, and he will take care of them. 
26Ezk 34:24 I, the LORD, will be their God, and a king like my servant David will be their ruler. I have spoken. 
26Ezk 34:25 I will make a covenant with them that guarantees their security. I will get rid of all the dangerous animals in the land, so that my sheep can live safely in the fields and sleep in the forests. 
26Ezk 34:26 "I will bless them and let them live around my sacred hill. There I will bless them with showers of rain when they need it. 
26Ezk 34:27 The trees will bear fruit, the fields will produce crops, and everyone will live in safety on his own land. When I break my people's chains and set them free from those who made them slaves, then they will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 34:28 The heathen nations will not plunder them any more, and the wild animals will not kill and eat them. They will live in safety, and no one will terrify them. 
26Ezk 34:29 I will give them fertile fields and put an end to hunger in the land. The other nations will not sneer at them any more. 
26Ezk 34:30 Everyone will know that I protect Israel and that they are my people. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
26Ezk 34:31 "You, my sheep, the flock that I feed, are my people, and I am your God," says the Sovereign LORD. 
26Ezk 35:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 35:2 "Mortal man," he said, "denounce the country of Edom. 
26Ezk 35:3 Tell the people what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying�� "I am your enemy, mountains of Edom! I will make you a desolate wasteland. 
26Ezk 35:4 I will leave your cities in ruins And your land desolate; Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 35:5 "You were Israel's constant enemy and let her people be slaughtered in the time of her disaster, the time of final punishment for her sins. 
26Ezk 35:6 So then - as surely as I, the Sovereign LORD, am the living God - death is your fate, and you cannot escape it. You are guilty of murder, and murder will follow you. 
26Ezk 35:7 I will make the hill country of Edom a wasteland and kill everyone who travels through it. 
26Ezk 35:8 I will cover the mountains with corpses, and the bodies of those who are killed in battle will cover the hills and valleys. 
26Ezk 35:9 I will make you desolate forever, and no one will live in your cities again. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 35:10 "You said that the two nations, Judah and Israel, together with their lands, belonged to you and that you would possess them, even though I, the LORD, was their God. 
26Ezk 35:11 So then, as surely as I, the Sovereign LORD, am the living God, I will pay you back for your anger, your jealousy, and your hate toward my people. They will know that I am punishing you for what you did to them. 
26Ezk 35:12 Then you will know that I, the LORD, heard you say with contempt that the mountains of Israel were desolate and that they were yours to devour. 
26Ezk 35:13 I have heard the wild, boastful way you have talked against me." 
26Ezk 35:14 The Sovereign LORD says, "I will make you so desolate that the whole world will rejoice at your downfall, 
26Ezk 35:15 just as you rejoiced at the devastation of Israel, my own possession. The mountains of Seir, yes, all the land of Edom, will be desolate. Then everyone will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 36:1 The LORD said, "Mortal man, speak to the mountains of Israel and tell them to listen to the message which I, 
26Ezk 36:2 the Sovereign LORD, have for them�� Israel's enemies gloated and said, 'Now those ancient hills are ours!' 
26Ezk 36:3 "Prophesy, then, and announce what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying. When the neighboring nations captured and plundered the mountains of Israel, everyone made fun of Israel. 
26Ezk 36:4 So now listen to what I, the Sovereign LORD, say to you mountains and hills, to you brooks and valleys, to you places that were left in ruins, and to you deserted cities which were plundered and mocked by all the surrounding nations. 
26Ezk 36:5 "I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken out in the heat of my anger against the surrounding nations, and especially against Edom. With glee and contempt they captured my land and took possession of its pastures. 
26Ezk 36:6 "So prophesy to the land of Israel; tell the mountains, hills, brooks, and valleys what I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying in jealous anger because of the way the nations have insulted and humiliated them. 
26Ezk 36:7 I, the Sovereign LORD, solemnly promise that the surrounding nations will be humiliated. 
26Ezk 36:8 But on the mountains of Israel the trees will again grow leaves and bear fruit for you, my people Israel. You are going to come home soon. 
26Ezk 36:9 I am on your side, and I will make sure that your land is plowed again and crops are planted on it. 
26Ezk 36:10 I will make your population grow. You will live in the cities and rebuild everything that was left in ruins. 
26Ezk 36:11 I will make people and cattle increase in number. There will be more of you than ever before, and you will have many children. I will let you live there as you used to live, and I will make you more prosperous than ever. Then you will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 36:12 I will bring you, my people Israel, back to live again in the land. It will be your own land, and it will never again let your children starve. 
26Ezk 36:13 "I, the Sovereign LORD, say�� It is true that people say that the land eats people and that it robs the nation of its children. 
26Ezk 36:14 But from now on it will no longer eat people and rob you of your children. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
26Ezk 36:15 The land will no longer have to listen to the nations making fun of it or see the peoples sneer at it. The land will no longer rob the nation of its children. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 36:16 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 36:17 "Mortal man," he said, "when the Israelites were living in their land, they defiled it by the way they lived and acted. I regarded their behavior as being as ritually unclean as a woman is during her monthly period. 
26Ezk 36:18 I let them feel the force of my anger because of the murders they had committed in the land and because of the idols by which they had defiled it. 
26Ezk 36:19 I condemned them for the way they lived and acted, and I scattered them through foreign countries. 
26Ezk 36:20 Wherever they went, they brought disgrace on my holy name, because people would say, 'These are the people of the LORD, but they had to leave his land.' 
26Ezk 36:21 That made me concerned for my holy name, since the Israelites brought disgrace on it everywhere they went. 
26Ezk 36:22 "Now then, give the Israelites the message that I, the Sovereign LORD, have for them�� What I am going to do is not for the sake of you Israelites, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have disgraced in every country where you have gone. 
26Ezk 36:23 When I demonstrate to the nations the holiness of my great name - the name you disgraced among them - then they will know that I am the LORD. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. I will use you to show the nations that I am holy. 
26Ezk 36:24 I will take you from every nation and country and bring you back to your own land. 
26Ezk 36:25 I will sprinkle clean water on you and make you clean from all your idols and everything else that has defiled you. 
26Ezk 36:26 I will give you a new heart and a new mind. I will take away your stubborn heart of stone and give you an obedient heart. 
26Ezk 36:27 I will put my spirit in you and will see to it that you follow my laws and keep all the commands I have given you. 
26Ezk 36:28 Then you will live in the land I gave your ancestors. You will be my people, and I will be your God. 
26Ezk 36:29 I will save you from everything that defiles you. I will command the grain to be plentiful, so that you will not have any more famines. 
26Ezk 36:30 I will increase the yield of your fruit trees and your fields, so that there will be no more famines to disgrace you among the nations. 
26Ezk 36:31 You will remember your evil conduct and the wrongs that you committed, and you will be disgusted with yourselves because of your sins and your iniquities. 
26Ezk 36:32 Israel, I want you to know that I am not doing all this for your sake. I want you to feel the shame and disgrace of what you are doing. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 36:33 The Sovereign LORD says, "When I make you clean from all your sins, I will let you live in your cities again and let you rebuild the ruins. 
26Ezk 36:34 Everyone who used to walk by your fields saw how overgrown and wild they were, but I will let you farm them again. 
26Ezk 36:35 Everyone will talk about how this land, which was once a wilderness, has become like the Garden of Eden, and how the cities which were torn down, looted, and left in ruins, are now inhabited and fortified. 
26Ezk 36:36 Then the neighboring nations that have survived will know that I, the LORD, rebuild ruined cities and replant waste fields. I, the LORD, have promised that I would do this - and I will." 
26Ezk 36:37 The Sovereign LORD says, "I will once again let the Israelites ask me for help, and I will let them increase in numbers like a flock of sheep. 
26Ezk 36:38 The cities that are now in ruins will then be as full of people as Jerusalem was once full of the sheep which were offered as sacrifices at a festival. Then they will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 37:1 I felt the powerful presence of the LORD, and his spirit took me and set me down in a valley where the ground was covered with bones. 
26Ezk 37:2 He led me all around the valley, and I could see that there were very many bones and that they were very dry. 
26Ezk 37:3 He said to me, "Mortal man, can these bones come back to life?" I replied, "Sovereign LORD, only you can answer that!" 
26Ezk 37:4 He said, "Prophesy to the bones. Tell these dry bones to listen to the word of the LORD. 
26Ezk 37:5 Tell them that I, the Sovereign LORD, am saying to them�� I am going to put breath into you and bring you back to life. 
26Ezk 37:6 I will give you sinews and muscles, and cover you with skin. I will put breath into you and bring you back to life. Then you will know that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 37:7 So I prophesied as I had been told. While I was speaking, I heard a rattling noise, and the bones began to join together. 
26Ezk 37:8 While I watched, the bones were covered with sinews and muscles, and then with skin. But there was no breath in the bodies. 
26Ezk 37:9 God said to me, "Mortal man, prophesy to the wind. Tell the wind that the Sovereign LORD commands it to come from every direction, to breathe into these dead bodies, and to bring them back to life." 
26Ezk 37:10 So I prophesied as I had been told. Breath entered the bodies, and they came to life and stood up. There were enough of them to form an army. 
26Ezk 37:11 God said to me, "Mortal man, the people of Israel are like these bones. They say that they are dried up, without any hope and with no future. 
26Ezk 37:12 So prophesy to my people Israel and tell them that I, the Sovereign LORD, am going to open their graves. I am going to take them out and bring them back to the land of Israel. 
26Ezk 37:13 When I open the graves where my people are buried and bring them out, they will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 37:14 I will put my breath in them, bring them back to life, and let them live in their own land. Then they will know that I am the LORD. I have promised that I would do this - and I will. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 37:15 The LORD spoke to me again. 
26Ezk 37:16 "Mortal man," he said, "take a wooden stick and write on it the words, 'The kingdom of Judah.' Then take another stick and write on it the words, 'The kingdom of Israel.' 
26Ezk 37:17 Then hold the two sticks end to end in your hand so that they look like one stick. 
26Ezk 37:18 When your people ask you to tell them what this means, 
26Ezk 37:19 tell them that I, the Sovereign LORD, am going to take the stick representing Israel and put it with the one that represents Judah. Out of the two I will make one stick and hold it in my hand. 
26Ezk 37:20 "Hold in your hand the two sticks and let the people see them. 
26Ezk 37:21 Then tell them that I, the Sovereign LORD, am going to take all my people out of the nations where they have gone, gather them together, and bring them back to their own land. 
26Ezk 37:22 I will unite them into one nation in the land, on the mountains of Israel. They will have one king to rule over them, and they will no longer be divided into two nations or split into two kingdoms. 
26Ezk 37:23 They will not defile themselves with disgusting idols any more or corrupt themselves with sin. I will free them from all the ways in which they sin and betray me. I will purify them; they will be my people, and I will be their God. 
26Ezk 37:24 A king like my servant David will be their king. They will all be united under one ruler and will obey my laws faithfully. 
26Ezk 37:25 They will live on the land I gave to my servant Jacob, the land where their ancestors lived. They will live there forever, and so will their children and all their descendants. A king like my servant David will rule them forever. 
26Ezk 37:26 I will make a covenant with them that guarantees their security forever. I will establish them and increase their population, and will see to it that my Temple stands forever in their land. 
26Ezk 37:27 I will live there with them; I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
26Ezk 37:28 When I place my Temple there to be among them forever, then the nations will know that I, the LORD, have chosen Israel to be my own people." 
26Ezk 38:1 The LORD spoke to me. 
26Ezk 38:2 "Mortal man," he said, "denounce Gog, chief ruler of the nations of Meshech and Tubal in the land of Magog. Denounce him 
26Ezk 38:3 and tell him that I, the Sovereign LORD, am his enemy. 
26Ezk 38:4 I will turn him around, put hooks in his jaws, and drag him and all his troops away. His army, with its horses and uniformed riders, is enormous, and every soldier carries a shield and is armed with a sword. 
26Ezk 38:5 Troops from Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya are with him, and all have shields and helmets. 
26Ezk 38:6 All the fighting men of the lands of Gomer and Beth Togarmah in the north are with him, and so are men from many other nations. 
26Ezk 38:7 Tell him to get ready and have all his troops ready at his command. 
26Ezk 38:8 After many years I will order him to invade a country where the people were brought back together from many nations and have lived without fear of war. He will invade the mountains of Israel, which were desolate and deserted so long, but where all the people now live in safety. 
26Ezk 38:9 He and his army and the many nations with him will attack like a storm and cover the land like a cloud." 
26Ezk 38:10 This is what the Sovereign LORD says to Gog�� "When that time comes, you will start thinking up an evil plan. 
26Ezk 38:11 You will decide to invade a helpless country where the people live in peace and security in unwalled towns that have no defenses. 
26Ezk 38:12 You will plunder and loot the people who live in cities that were once in ruins. They have been gathered from the nations, and now they have livestock and property and live at the crossroads of the world. 
26Ezk 38:13 The people of Sheba and Dedan and the merchants from the towns of Spain will ask you, 'Have you assembled your army and attacked in order to loot and plunder? Do you intend to get silver and gold, livestock and property, and march off with all those spoils?' " 
26Ezk 38:14 So the Sovereign LORD sent me to tell Gog what he was saying to him�� "Now while my people Israel live in security, you will set out 
26Ezk 38:15 to come from your place in the far north, leading a large, powerful army of soldiers from many nations, all of them on horseback. 
26Ezk 38:16 You will attack my people Israel like a storm moving across the land. When the time comes, I will send you to invade my land in order to show the nations who I am, to show my holiness by what I do through you. 
26Ezk 38:17 You are the one I was talking about long ago, when I announced through my servants, the prophets of Israel, that in days to come I would bring someone to attack Israel." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 38:18 The Sovereign LORD says, "On the day when Gog invades Israel, I will become furious. 
26Ezk 38:19 I declare in the heat of my anger that on that day there will be a severe earthquake in the land of Israel. 
26Ezk 38:20 Every fish and bird, every animal large and small, and every human being on the face of the earth will tremble for fear of me. Mountains will fall, cliffs will crumble, and every wall will collapse. 
26Ezk 38:21 I will terrify Gog with all sorts of calamities. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. His men will turn their swords against one another. 
26Ezk 38:22 I will punish him with disease and bloodshed. Torrents of rain and hail, together with fire and sulfur, will pour down on him and his army and on the many nations that are on his side. 
26Ezk 38:23 In this way I will show all the nations that I am great and that I am holy. They will know then that I am the LORD." 
26Ezk 39:1 The Sovereign LORD said, "Mortal man, denounce Gog, the chief ruler of the nations of Meshech and Tubal, and tell him that I am his enemy. 
26Ezk 39:2 I will turn him in a new direction and lead him out of the far north until he comes to the mountains of Israel. 
26Ezk 39:3 Then I will knock his bow out of his left hand and his arrows out of his right hand. 
26Ezk 39:4 Gog and his army and his allies will fall dead on the mountains of Israel, and I will let their bodies be food for all the birds and wild animals. 
26Ezk 39:5 They will fall dead in the open field. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
26Ezk 39:6 I will start a fire in the land of Magog and along all the seacoasts where people live undisturbed, and everyone will know that I am the LORD. 
26Ezk 39:7 I will make sure that my people Israel know my holy name, and I will not let my name be disgraced any more. Then the nations will know that I, the LORD, am the holy God of Israel." 
26Ezk 39:8 The Sovereign LORD said, "The day I spoke about is certain to come. 
26Ezk 39:9 The people who live in the cities of Israel will go out and collect the abandoned weapons for firewood. They will build fires with the shields, bows, arrows, spears, and clubs, and have enough to last for seven years. 
26Ezk 39:10 They will not have to gather firewood in the fields or cut down trees in the forest, because they will have the abandoned weapons to burn. They will loot and plunder those who looted and plundered them." The Sovereign LORD has spoken. 
26Ezk 39:11 The LORD said, "When all this happens, I will give Gog a burial ground there in Israel, in Travelers' Valley, east of the Dead Sea. Gog and all his army will be buried there, and the valley will be called 'The Valley of Gog's Army.' 
26Ezk 39:12 It will take the Israelites seven months to bury all the corpses and make the land clean again. 
26Ezk 39:13 Everyone in the land will help bury them, and they will be honored for this on the day of my victory. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
26Ezk 39:14 After the seven months are over, men will be chosen to travel through the land in order to find and bury those bodies remaining on the ground, so that they can make the land clean. 
26Ezk 39:15 As they go up and down the country, every time they find a human bone, they will put a marker beside it so that the gravediggers can come and bury it in the Valley of Gog's Army. 
26Ezk 39:16 (There will be a town nearby named after the army.) And so the land will be made clean again." 
26Ezk 39:17 The Sovereign LORD said to me, "Mortal man, call all the birds and animals to come from all around to eat the sacrifice I am preparing for them. It will be a huge feast on the mountains of Israel, where they can eat meat and drink blood. 
26Ezk 39:18 They are to eat the bodies of soldiers and drink the blood of the rulers of the earth, all of whom will be killed like rams or lambs or goats or fat bulls. 
26Ezk 39:19 When I kill these people like sacrifices, the birds and animals are to eat all the fat they can hold and to drink blood until they are drunk. 
26Ezk 39:20 At my table they will eat all they can hold of horses and their riders and of soldiers and fighting men. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 39:21 The LORD said, "I will let the nations see my glory and show them how I use my power to carry out my just decisions. 
26Ezk 39:22 The Israelites will know from then on that I am the LORD their God. 
26Ezk 39:23 And the nations will know that the Israelites went into exile because of the sins which they committed against me. I turned away from them and let their enemies defeat them and kill them in battle. 
26Ezk 39:24 I gave them what they deserved for their uncleanness and their wickedness, and I turned away from them." 
26Ezk 39:25 The Sovereign LORD said, "But now I will be merciful to Jacob's descendants, the people of Israel, and make them prosperous again. I will protect my holy name. 
26Ezk 39:26 When they are once more living in safety in their own land, with no one to threaten them, they will be able to forget how they were disgraced for having betrayed me. 
26Ezk 39:27 In order to show to the many nations that I am holy, I will bring my people back from all the countries where their enemies live. 
26Ezk 39:28 Then my people will know that I am the LORD their God. They will know this, because I sent them into captivity and now gather them and bring them back into their own land, not leaving even one of them behind. 
26Ezk 39:29 I will pour out my spirit on the people of Israel and never again turn away from them. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 40:1 It was the tenth day of the new year, which was the twenty-fifth year after we had been taken into exile and the fourteenth year after Jerusalem was captured. On that day I felt the powerful presence of the LORD, and he carried me away. 
26Ezk 40:2 In a vision God took me to the land of Israel and put me on a high mountain. I saw in front of me a group of buildings that looked like a city. 
26Ezk 40:3 He took me closer, and I saw a man who shone like bronze. He was holding a linen tape measure and a measuring rod and was standing by a gateway. 
26Ezk 40:4 He said to me, "Watch, mortal man. Listen carefully and pay close attention to everything I show you, because this is why you were brought here. You are to tell the people of Israel everything you see." 
26Ezk 40:5 What I saw was the Temple, and there was a wall around it. The man took his measuring rod, which was 10 feet long, and measured the wall. It was 10 feet high and 10 feet thick. 
26Ezk 40:6 Then he went to the gateway that faced east. He went up the steps, and at the top he measured the entrance; it was 10 feet deep. 
26Ezk 40:7 Beyond it there was a passageway, which had three guardrooms on each side. Each of the rooms was square, 10 feet on each side, and the walls between them were 8 feet thick. Beyond the guardrooms there was a passageway 10 feet long that led to an entrance room which faced the Temple. 
26Ezk 40:8 He measured this room and found it was 14 feet deep. 
26Ezk 40:9 It formed that end of the gateway which was nearest the Temple, and at its far end the walls were 4 feet thick. 
26Ezk 40:10 (These guardrooms on each side of the passageway were all the same size, and the walls between them were all of the same thickness.) 
26Ezk 40:11 Next, the man measured the width of the passageway in the gateway. It was 22 feet altogether, and the space between the open gates was 16 feet. 
26Ezk 40:12 In front of each of the guardrooms there was a low wall 20 inches high and 20 inches thick. (The rooms were 10 feet square.) 
26Ezk 40:13 Then he measured the distance from the back wall of one room to the back wall of the room across the passageway from it, and it was 42 feet. 
26Ezk 40:14 The room at the far end led out to a courtyard. He measured that room and found it was 34 feet wide. 
26Ezk 40:15 The total length of the gateway from the outside wall of the gate to the far side of the last room was 84 feet. 
26Ezk 40:16 There were small openings in the outside walls of all the rooms and also in the inner walls between the rooms. There were palm trees carved on the inner walls that faced the passageway. 
26Ezk 40:17 The man took me through the gateway into the courtyard. There were thirty rooms built against the outer wall, and in front of them there was an area paved with stones, 
26Ezk 40:18 which extended around the courtyard. This outer courtyard was at a lower level than the inner courtyard. 
26Ezk 40:19 There was a gateway at a higher level that led to the inner courtyard. The man measured the distance between the two gateways, and it was 168 feet. 
26Ezk 40:20 Then the man measured the gateway on the north side that led into the outer courtyard. 
26Ezk 40:21 The three guardrooms on each side of the passageway, the walls between them, and the entrance room all had the same measurements as those in the east gateway. The total length of the gateway was 84 feet and the width 42 feet. 
26Ezk 40:22 The entrance room, the windows, and the carved palm trees were like those in the east gate. Here seven steps led up to the gate, and the entrance room was at the end facing the courtyard. 
26Ezk 40:23 Across the courtyard from this north gateway was another gateway leading to the inner courtyard, just as there was on the east side. The man measured the distance between these two gateways, and it was 168 feet. 
26Ezk 40:24 Next, the man took me to the south side, and there we saw another gateway. He measured its inner walls and its entrance room, and they were the same as the others. 
26Ezk 40:25 There were windows in the rooms of this gateway just as in the others. The total length of the gateway was 84 feet and the width 42 feet. 
26Ezk 40:26 Seven steps led up to it, and its entrance room was also at the end facing the courtyard. There were palm trees carved on the inner walls that faced the passageway. 
26Ezk 40:27 Here, too, there was a gateway leading to the inner courtyard. The man measured the distance to this second gateway, and it was 168 feet. 
26Ezk 40:28 The man took me through the south gateway into the inner courtyard. He measured the gateway, and it was the same size as the gateways in the outer wall. 
26Ezk 40:29 Its guardrooms, its entrance room, and its inner walls were the same size as those in the other gateways. There were also windows in the rooms of this gateway.
26Ezk 40:30 The total length was 84 feet and the width 42 feet. 
26Ezk 40:31 Its entrance room faced the other courtyard, and palm trees were carved on the walls along the passageway. Eight steps led up to this gate. 
26Ezk 40:32 The man took me through the east gateway into the inner courtyard. He measured the gateway, and it was the same size as the others. 
26Ezk 40:33 Its guardrooms, its entrance room, and its inner walls measured the same as those in the other gateways. There were windows all around, and in the entrance room also. The total length was 84 feet and the width 42 feet. 
26Ezk 40:34 The entrance room faced the outer courtyard. Palm trees were carved on the walls along the passageway. Eight steps led up to this gate. 
26Ezk 40:35 Then the man took me to the north gateway. He measured it, and it was the same size as the others. 
26Ezk 40:36 Like them, it also had guardrooms, decorated inner walls, an entrance room, and windows all around. Its total length was 84 feet and its width 42 feet. 
26Ezk 40:37 The entrance room faced the outer courtyard. Palm trees were carved on the walls along the passageway. Eight steps led up to this gate. 
26Ezk 40:38 In the outer courtyard there was an annex attached to the inner gateway on the north side. It opened into the entrance room that faced the courtyard, and there they washed the carcasses of the animals to be burned whole as sacrifices. 
26Ezk 40:39 In this entrance room there were four tables, two on each side of the room. It was on these tables that they killed the animals to be offered as sacrifices, either to be burned whole or to be sacrifices for sin or as repayment offerings. 
26Ezk 40:40 Outside the room there were four similar tables, two on either side of the entrance of the north gate. 
26Ezk 40:41 Altogether there were eight tables on which the animals to be sacrificed were killed�� four inside the room and four out in the courtyard. 
26Ezk 40:42 The four tables in the annex, used to prepare the offerings to be burned whole, were of cut stone. They were 20 inches high, and their tops were 30 inches square. All the equipment used in killing the sacrificial animals was kept on these tables. 
26Ezk 40:43 Ledges 3 inches wide ran around the edge of the tables. All the meat to be offered in sacrifice was placed on the tables. 
26Ezk 40:44 Then he brought me into the inner court. There were two rooms opening on the inner court, one facing south beside the north gateway and the other facing north beside the south gateway. 
26Ezk 40:45 The man told me that the room which faced south was for the priests who served in the Temple, 
26Ezk 40:46 and the room which faced north was for the priests who served at the altar. All the priests are descended from Zadok; they are the only members of the tribe of Levi who are permitted to go into the LORD's presence to serve him. 
26Ezk 40:47 The man measured the inner courtyard, and it was 168 feet square. The Temple was on the west side, and in front of it was an altar. 
26Ezk 40:48 Then he took me into the entrance room of the Temple. He measured the entranceway�� it was 9 feet deep and 24 feet wide, with walls 5 feet thick on either side. 
26Ezk 40:49 Steps led up to the entrance room, which was 34 feet wide and 20 feet deep. There were two columns, one on each side of the entrance. 
26Ezk 41:1 Next, the man took me into the central room, the Holy Place. He measured the passageway into it�� it was 10 feet deep 
26Ezk 41:2 and 18 feet wide, with walls 8 feet thick on either side. He measured the room itself�� it was 68 feet long and 34 feet wide. 
26Ezk 41:3 Then he went to the innermost room. He measured the passageway into it�� it was 3 feet deep and 10 feet wide, with walls on either side 12 feet thick. 
26Ezk 41:4 He measured the room itself, and it was 34 feet square. This room was beyond the central room. Then he said to me, "This is the Most Holy Place." 
26Ezk 41:5 The man measured the thickness of the inner wall of the Temple building, and it was 10 feet. Against this wall, all around the Temple, was a series of small rooms 7 feet wide. 
26Ezk 41:6 These rooms were in three stories, with thirty rooms on each floor. The Temple's outer wall on each floor was thinner than on the floor below, so that the rooms could rest on the wall without being anchored into it. 
26Ezk 41:7 And so the Temple walls, when seen from the outside, seemed to have the same thickness all the way to the top. Against the Temple's outer wall, on the outside of the rooms, two wide stairways were built, so that it was possible to go from the lower story to the middle and the upper stories. 
26Ezk 41:8 The outside wall of these rooms was 8 feet thick; there was one door into the rooms on the north side of the Temple, and one into those on the south side. 
26Ezk 41:9 I saw that there was a terrace 8 feet wide around the Temple; 
26Ezk 41:10 it was 10 feet above the ground and it was level with the foundation of the rooms by the Temple walls. 
26Ezk 41:11 Between the terrace and the buildings used by the priests there was an open space 34 feet across, along the sides of the Temple. 
26Ezk 41:12 At the far end of the open space on the west side of the Temple there was a building 150 feet long and 116 feet wide; its walls were 9 feet thick all around. 
26Ezk 41:13 The man measured the outside of the Temple, and it was 168 feet long. And from the back of the Temple, across the open space to the far side of the building to the west, the distance was also 168 feet. 
26Ezk 41:14 The distance across the front of the Temple, including the open space on either side, was also 168 feet. 
26Ezk 41:15 He measured the length of the building to the west, including its galleries on both sides, and it was also 168 feet. The entrance room of the Temple, the Holy Place, and the Most Holy Place 
26Ezk 41:16 were all paneled with wood from the floor to the windows. These windows could be covered. 
26Ezk 41:17 The inside walls of the Temple, up as high as above the doors, were completely covered with carvings 
26Ezk 41:18 of palm trees and winged creatures. Palm trees alternated with creatures, one following the other, all the way around the room. Each creature had two faces�� 
26Ezk 41:19 a human face that was turned toward the palm tree on one side, and a lion's face that was turned toward the tree on the other side. It was like this all around the wall, 
26Ezk 41:20 from the floor to above the doors. 
26Ezk 41:21 The doorposts of the Holy Place were square. In front of the entrance of the Most Holy Place there was something that looked like 
26Ezk 41:22 a wooden altar. It was 5 feet high and 4 feet wide. Its corner posts, its base, and its sides were all made of wood. The man said to me, "This is the table which stands in the presence of the LORD." 
26Ezk 41:23 There was a door at the end of the passageway to the Holy Place and one also at the end of the passageway to the Most Holy Place. 
26Ezk 41:24 They were double doors that swung open in the middle. 
26Ezk 41:25 There were palm trees and winged creatures carved on the doors of the Holy Place, just as there were on the walls. And there was a wooden covering over the outside of the doorway of the entrance room. 
26Ezk 41:26 At the sides of this room there were windows, and the walls were decorated with palm trees. 
26Ezk 42:1 Then the man took me into the outer courtyard and led me to a building on the north side of the Temple, not far from the building at the west end of the Temple. 
26Ezk 42:2 This building was 168 feet long and 84 feet wide. 
26Ezk 42:3 On one side it faced the space 34 feet wide which was alongside the Temple, and on the other side it faced the pavement of the outer courtyard. It was built on three levels, each one set further back than the one below it. 
26Ezk 42:4 Along the north side of this building was a passageway 16 feet wide and 168 feet long, with entrances on that side. 
26Ezk 42:5 The rooms at the upper level of the building were narrower than those at the middle and lower levels because they were set further back. 
26Ezk 42:6 The rooms at all three levels were on terraces and were not supported by columns like the other buildings in the courtyard. 
26Ezk 42:7 At the lower level the outer wall of the building was solid for 84 feet, half its length; and there were rooms in the remaining 84 feet. 
26Ezk 42:8 At the top level there were rooms in the entire length of the building. 
26Ezk 42:9 Below these rooms at the east end of the building, where the wall of the courtyard began, there was an entrance into the outer courtyard. 
26Ezk 42:10 At the south side of the Temple there was an identical building not far from the building at the west end of the Temple. 
26Ezk 42:11 In front of the rooms there was a passageway just like the one on the north side. It had the same measurements, the same design, and the same kind of entrances. 
26Ezk 42:12 There was a door under the rooms on the south side of the building, at the east end where the wall began. 
26Ezk 42:13 The man said to me, "Both these buildings are holy. In them the priests who enter the LORD's presence eat the holiest offerings. Because the rooms are holy, the priests will place the holiest offerings there�� the offerings of grain and the sacrifices offered for sin or as repayment offerings. 
26Ezk 42:14 When priests have been in the Temple and want to go to the outer courtyard, they must leave in these rooms the holy clothing they wore while serving the LORD. They must put on other clothes before going out to the area where the people gather." 
26Ezk 42:15 When the man had finished measuring inside the Temple area, he took me out through the east gate and then measured the outside of the area. 
26Ezk 42:16 He took the measuring rod and measured the east side, and it was 840 feet. 
26Ezk 42:17 Then he measured the north side, 
26Ezk 42:18 the south side, and the west side; 
26Ezk 42:19 each side had the same length, 840 feet,
26Ezk 42:20 so that the wall enclosed a square 840 feet on each side. The wall served to separate what was holy from what was not. 
26Ezk 43:1 The man took me to the gate that faces east, 
26Ezk 43:2 and there I saw coming from the east the dazzling light of the presence of the God of Israel. God's voice sounded like the roar of the sea, and the earth shone with the dazzling light. 
26Ezk 43:3 This vision was like the one I had seen when God came to destroy Jerusalem, and the one I saw by the Chebar River. Then I threw myself face downward on the ground. 
26Ezk 43:4 The dazzling light passed through the east gate and went into the Temple. 
26Ezk 43:5 The LORD's spirit lifted me up and took me into the inner courtyard, where I saw that the Temple was filled with the glory of the LORD. 
26Ezk 43:6 The man stood beside me there, and I heard the LORD speak to me out of the Temple�� 
26Ezk 43:7 "Mortal man, here is my throne. I will live here among the people of Israel and rule them forever. Neither the people of Israel nor their kings will ever again disgrace my holy name by worshiping other gods or by burying the corpses of their dead kings. 
26Ezk 43:8 The kings built the doorsills and doorposts of their palace right against the doorsills and doorposts of my Temple, so that there was only a wall between us. They disgraced my holy name by all the disgusting things they did, and so in my anger I destroyed them. 
26Ezk 43:9 Now they must stop worshiping other gods and remove the corpses of their kings. If they do, I will live among them forever." 
26Ezk 43:10 And the LORD continued, "Mortal man, tell the people of Israel about the Temple, and let them study its plan. Make them ashamed of their sinful actions. 
26Ezk 43:11 Then if they are ashamed of what they have done, explain the plan of the Temple to them�� its design, its entrances and exits, its shape, the arrangement of everything, and all its rules and regulations. Write all this down for them so that they can see how everything is arranged and can carry out all the rules. 
26Ezk 43:12 This is the law of the Temple�� All the area surrounding it on the top of the mountain is sacred and holy." 
26Ezk 43:13 These are the measurements of the altar, using the same unit of measure as in measuring the Temple. All around the base of the altar there was a gutter 20 inches deep and 20 inches wide, with a rim at the outside edge 10 inches high. 
26Ezk 43:14 The lowest section of the altar, from the top of the base, was 4 feet high. The next section was set back from the edge 20 inches all around, and was 7 feet high. The section after that was also set back from the edge 20 inches all around. 
26Ezk 43:15 This top section, on which the sacrifices were burned, was also 7 feet high. The projections on the four corners were higher than the rest of the top. 
26Ezk 43:16 The top of the altar was a square, 20 feet on each side. 
26Ezk 43:17 The middle section was also a square, 24 feet on each side, with a rim at the outside edge 10 inches high. (The gutter was 20 inches wide.) The steps going up the altar were on the east side. 
26Ezk 43:18 The Sovereign LORD said to me, "Mortal man, listen to what I tell you. When the altar is built, you are to dedicate it by burning sacrifices on it and by sprinkling on it the blood of the animals that were sacrificed. 
26Ezk 43:19 Those priests belonging to the tribe of Levi who are descended from Zadok are the only ones who are to come into my presence to serve me. I, the Sovereign LORD, command this. You will give them a young bull to offer as a sacrifice for sin. 
26Ezk 43:20 You are to take some of its blood and put it on the projections on the top corners of the altar, on the corners of the middle section of the altar, and all around its edges. In this way you will purify the altar and consecrate it. 
26Ezk 43:21 You are to take the bull that is offered as a sacrifice for sin and burn it at the specified place outside the Temple area. 
26Ezk 43:22 The next day you are to take a male goat without any defects and offer it as a sacrifice for sin. Purify the altar with its blood the same way you did with the bull. 
26Ezk 43:23 When you have finished doing that, take a young bull and a young ram, both of them without any defects, 
26Ezk 43:24 and bring them to me. The priests will sprinkle salt on them and burn them as an offering to me. 
26Ezk 43:25 Each day for seven days you are to offer a goat, a bull, and a ram as sacrifices for sin. All of them must be without any defects. 
26Ezk 43:26 For seven days the priests are to consecrate the altar and make it ready for use. 
26Ezk 43:27 When the week is over, the priests are to begin offering on the altar the burnt offerings and the fellowship offerings of the people. Then I will be pleased with all of you. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 44:1 The man led me to the outer gate at the east side of the Temple area. The gate was closed, 
26Ezk 44:2 and the LORD said to me, "This gate will stay closed and will never be opened. No human being is allowed to use it, because I, the LORD God of Israel, have entered through it. It is to remain closed. 
26Ezk 44:3 The ruling prince, however, may go there to eat a holy meal in my presence. He is to enter and leave the gateway through the entrance room at the inner end." 
26Ezk 44:4 Then the man took me through the north gate to the front of the Temple. As I looked, I saw that the Temple of the LORD was filled with the dazzling light of his presence. I threw myself face downward on the ground, 
26Ezk 44:5 and the LORD said to me, "Mortal man, pay attention to everything you see and hear. I am going to tell you the rules and regulations for the Temple. Note carefully which persons are allowed to go in and out of the Temple, and which persons are not allowed. 
26Ezk 44:6 "Tell those rebellious people of Israel that I, the Sovereign LORD, will no longer tolerate the disgusting things that they have been doing. 
26Ezk 44:7 They have profaned my Temple by letting uncircumcised foreigners, people who do not obey me, enter the Temple when the fat and the blood of the sacrifices are being offered to me. So my people have broken my covenant by all the disgusting things they have done. 
26Ezk 44:8 They have not taken charge of the sacred rituals in my Temple, but instead have put foreigners in charge. 
26Ezk 44:9 "I, the Sovereign LORD, declare that no uncircumcised foreigner, no one who disobeys me, will enter my Temple, not even a foreigner who lives among the people of Israel." 
26Ezk 44:10 The LORD said to me, "I am punishing those Levites who, together with the rest of the people of Israel, deserted me and worshiped idols. 
26Ezk 44:11 They may serve me in the Temple by taking charge of the gates and by performing the work of the Temple. They may kill the animals which the people offer for burnt offerings and for sacrifices, and they are to be on duty to serve the people. 
26Ezk 44:12 But because they conducted the worship of idols for the people of Israel and in this way led the people into sin, I, the Sovereign LORD, solemnly swear that they must be punished. 
26Ezk 44:13 They are not to serve me as priests or to go near anything that is holy to me or to enter the Most Holy Place. This is the punishment for the disgusting things they have done. 
26Ezk 44:14 I am assigning to them the menial work that is to be done in the Temple." 
26Ezk 44:15 The Sovereign LORD said, "Those priests belonging to the tribe of Levi who are descended from Zadok, however, continued to serve me faithfully in the Temple when the rest of the people of Israel turned away from me. So now they are the ones who are to serve me and come into my presence to offer me the fat and the blood of the sacrifices. 
26Ezk 44:16 They alone will enter my Temple, serve at my altar, and conduct the Temple worship. 
26Ezk 44:17 When they enter the gateway to the inner courtyard of the Temple, they are to put on linen clothing. They must not wear anything made of wool when they are on duty in the inner courtyard or in the Temple. 
26Ezk 44:18 So that they won't perspire, they are to wear linen turbans and linen trousers, but no belt. 
26Ezk 44:19 Before they go to the outer courtyard where the people are, they must first take off the clothes they wore on duty in the Temple and leave them in the holy rooms. They are to put on other clothing in order to keep their sacred clothing from harming the people. 
26Ezk 44:20 "Priests must neither shave their heads nor let their hair grow long. They are to keep it a proper length. 
26Ezk 44:21 Priests must not drink any wine before going into the inner courtyard. 
26Ezk 44:22 No priest may marry a divorced woman; he is to marry only an Israelite virgin or the widow of another priest. 
26Ezk 44:23 "The priests are to teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is not, and between what is ritually clean and what is not. 
26Ezk 44:24 When a legal dispute arises, the priests are to decide the case according to my laws. They are to keep the religious festivals according to my rules and regulations, and they are to keep the Sabbaths holy. 
26Ezk 44:25 "A priest is not to become ritually unclean by touching a corpse, unless it is one of his parents, one of his children or a brother or an unmarried sister. 
26Ezk 44:26 After he has become clean again, he must wait seven days 
26Ezk 44:27 and then go into the inner courtyard of the Temple and offer a sacrifice for his purification, so that he can serve in the Temple again. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
26Ezk 44:28 "The priests have the priesthood as their share of what I have given Israel to be handed down from one generation to another. They are not to hold property in Israel; I am all they need. 
26Ezk 44:29 The grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the repayment offerings will be the priests' food, and they are to receive everything in Israel that is set apart for me. 
26Ezk 44:30 The priests are to have the best of all the first harvest and of everything else that is offered to me. Each time the people bake bread, they are to give the priests the first loaf as an offering, and my blessing will rest on their homes. 
26Ezk 44:31 The priests must not eat any bird or animal that dies a natural death or is killed by another animal." 
26Ezk 45:1 When the land is divided to give each tribe a share, one part is to be dedicated to the LORD. It is to be 10 miles long by 8 miles wide. The entire area will be holy. 
26Ezk 45:2 In this area there is to be a square plot of land for the Temple, 840 feet on each side, entirely surrounded by an open space 84 feet wide. 
26Ezk 45:3 Half of this area, a section 10 miles by 4 miles, is to be measured off; it will contain the Temple, the holiest place of all. 
26Ezk 45:4 It will be a holy part of the country, set aside for the priests who serve the LORD in his Temple. It will contain their houses and the section of land for the Temple. 
26Ezk 45:5 The other half of the area is to be set aside as the possession of the Levites, who do the work in the Temple. There will be towns there for them to live in. 
26Ezk 45:6 Next to the holy area, another section, 10 miles long and 2 miles wide, is to be set aside for a city where any of the people of Israel may live. 
26Ezk 45:7 Land is also to be set aside for the ruling prince. From the west boundary of the holy area it will extend west to the Mediterranean Sea; and from the east boundary it will extend to the eastern border of the country, so that its length will be the same as the length of one of the areas allotted to the tribes of Israel. 
26Ezk 45:8 This area will be the share the ruling prince will have in the land of Israel, so that he will no longer oppress the people, but will let the rest of the country belong to the tribes of Israel. 
26Ezk 45:9 The Sovereign LORD said, "You have sinned too long, you rulers of Israel! Stop your violence and oppression. Do what is right and just. You must never again drive my people off their land. I, the Sovereign LORD, am telling you this. 
26Ezk 45:10 "Everyone must use honest weights and measures�� 
26Ezk 45:11 "The ephah for dry measure is to be equal to the bath for liquid measure. The standard is the homer. The resulting measures are as follows�� 1 homer = 10 ephahs = 10 baths
26Ezk 45:12 "Your weights are to be as follows�� 20 gerahs = 1 shekel 60 shekels = 1 mina
26Ezk 45:13 "This is the basis on which you are to make your offerings�� Wheat�� 1/60th of your harvest Barley�� 1/60th of your harvest Olive oil�� 1/100th of the yield of your trees (Measure it by the bath�� 10 baths = 1 homer = 1 kor.)
26Ezk 45:14 Sheep�� 1 sheep out of every 200 from the meadows of Israel "You are to bring grain offerings, animals to be burned whole, and animals for fellowship offerings, so that your sins will be forgiven. 
26Ezk 45:15 I, the Sovereign LORD, command it.
26Ezk 45:16 "All the people of the land must take these offerings to the ruling prince of Israel. 
26Ezk 45:17 It will be his duty to provide the animals to be burned whole, the grain offerings, and the wine offerings for the whole nation of Israel at the New Moon Festivals, the Sabbaths, and the other festivals. He is to provide the sin offerings, the grain offerings, the offerings to be burned whole, and the fellowship offerings, to take away the sins of the people of Israel." 
26Ezk 45:18 The Sovereign LORD said, "On the first day of the first month you are to sacrifice a bull without any defects and purify the Temple. 
26Ezk 45:19 The priest will take some of the blood of this sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the Temple, on the four corners of the altar, and on the posts of the gateways to the inner courtyard. 
26Ezk 45:20 On the seventh day of the month you are to do the same thing on behalf of anyone who sins unintentionally or through ignorance. In this way you will keep the Temple holy. 
26Ezk 45:21 "On the fourteenth day of the first month you will begin the celebration of the Passover Festival. For seven days everyone will eat bread made without yeast. 
26Ezk 45:22 On the first day of the festival the ruling prince must offer a bull as a sacrifice for his sins and for those of all the people. 
26Ezk 45:23 On each of the seven days of the festival he is to sacrifice to the LORD seven bulls and seven rams without any defects and burn them whole. He is also to sacrifice a male goat each day as a sin offering. 
26Ezk 45:24 For each bull and each ram that is sacrificed, there is to be an offering of half a bushel of grain and three quarts of olive oil. 
26Ezk 45:25 "For the Festival of Shelters, which begins on the fifteenth day of the seventh month, the prince will offer on each of the seven days the same sacrifice for sin, the same offerings to be burned whole, and the same offerings of grain and olive oil." 
26Ezk 46:1 The Sovereign LORD says, "The east gateway to the inner courtyard must be kept closed during the six working days, but it is to be opened on the Sabbath and at the New Moon Festival. 
26Ezk 46:2 The ruling prince will go from the outer courtyard into the entrance room of the gateway and stand beside the posts of the gate while the priests burn his sacrifices whole and offer his fellowship offerings. There at the gate he must worship and then go back out. The gate must not be shut until evening. 
26Ezk 46:3 Each Sabbath and each New Moon Festival all the people are also to bow down and worship the LORD in front of the gate. 
26Ezk 46:4 On the Sabbath the prince is to bring to the LORD, as sacrifices to be burned whole, six lambs and one ram, all without any defects. 
26Ezk 46:5 With each ram he is to bring an offering of half a bushel of grain, and with each lamb he is to bring whatever he wants to give. For each half-bushel of grain offering he is to bring three quarts of olive oil. 
26Ezk 46:6 At the New Moon Festival he will offer a young bull, six lambs, and a ram, all without any defects. 
26Ezk 46:7 With each bull and each ram the offering is to be half a bushel of grain, and with each lamb the offering is to be whatever the prince wants to give. Three quarts of olive oil are to be offered with each half-bushel of grain. 
26Ezk 46:8 The prince must leave the entrance room of the gateway and go out by the same way he went in. 
26Ezk 46:9 "When the people come to worship the LORD at any festival, those who enter by the north gate are to leave by the south gate after they have worshiped, and those who enter by the south gate are to leave by the north gate. No one may go out by the same way he entered, but must leave by the opposite gate. 
26Ezk 46:10 The prince is to come in when the people come, and leave when they leave. 
26Ezk 46:11 On the feast days and at the festivals the grain offering will be half a bushel with each bull or ram, and whatever the worshiper wants to give with each lamb. Three quarts of olive oil are to be offered with each half-bushel of grain. 
26Ezk 46:12 "When the ruling prince wants to make a voluntary offering to the LORD, either an offering to be burned whole or a fellowship offering, the east gate to the inner courtyard will be opened for him. He is to make the offering in the same way he does on the Sabbath, and the gate is to be closed after he goes back out." 
26Ezk 46:13 The LORD says, "Every morning a one-year-old lamb without any defects is to be burned whole as an offering to the LORD. This offering must be made every day. 
26Ezk 46:14 Also an offering of five pounds of flour is to be made every morning, along with one quart of olive oil for mixing with the flour. The rules for this offering to the LORD are to be in force forever. 
26Ezk 46:15 The lamb, the flour, and the olive oil are to be offered to the LORD every morning forever." 
26Ezk 46:16 The Sovereign LORD commands�� "If the ruling prince gives any of the land he owns to one of his sons as a present, it will belong to that son as a part of his family property. 
26Ezk 46:17 But if the ruling prince gives any of his land to anyone who is in his service, it will become the prince's property again when the Year of Restoration comes. It belongs to him, and only he and his sons can own it permanently. 
26Ezk 46:18 The ruling prince must not take any of the people's property away from them. Any land he gives to his sons must be from the land that is assigned to him, so that he will not oppress any of my people by taking their land." 
26Ezk 46:19 Then the man took me to the entrance of the rooms facing north near the gate on the south side of the inner courtyard. These are holy rooms for the priests. He pointed out a place on the west side of the rooms 
26Ezk 46:20 and said, "This is the place where the priests are to boil the meat offered as sacrifices for sin or as repayment offerings, and to bake the offerings of flour, so that nothing holy is carried to the outer courtyard, where it might harm the people." 
26Ezk 46:21 Then he led me to the outer courtyard and showed me that in each of its four corners there was a smaller courtyard, 
26Ezk 46:22 68 feet long and 48 feet wide. 
26Ezk 46:23 Each one had a stone wall around it, with fireplaces built against the wall. 
26Ezk 46:24 The man told me, "These are the kitchens where the Temple servants are to boil the sacrifices the people offer." 
26Ezk 47:1 The man led me back to the entrance of the Temple. Water was coming out from under the entrance and flowing east, the direction the Temple faced. It was flowing down from under the south part of the Temple past the south side of the altar. 
26Ezk 47:2 The man then took me out of the Temple area by way of the north gate and led me around to the gate that faces east. A small stream of water was flowing out at the south side of the gate. 
26Ezk 47:3 With his measuring rod the man measured 560 yards downstream to the east and told me to wade through the stream there. The water came only to my ankles. 
26Ezk 47:4 Then he measured another 560 yards, and the water came up to my knees. Another 560 yards farther down, the water was up to my waist. 
26Ezk 47:5 He measured 560 yards more, and there the stream was so deep I could not wade through it. It was too deep to cross except by swimming. 
26Ezk 47:6 He said to me, "Mortal man, note all this carefully." Then the man took me back to the riverbank, 
26Ezk 47:7 and when I got there, I saw that there were very many trees on each bank. 
26Ezk 47:8 He said to me, "This water flows through the land to the east and down into the Jordan Valley and to the Dead Sea. When it flows into the Dead Sea, it replaces the salt water of that sea with fresh water. 
26Ezk 47:9 Wherever the stream flows, there will be all kinds of animals and fish. The stream will make the water of the Dead Sea fresh, and wherever it flows, it will bring life. 
26Ezk 47:10 From the Springs of Engedi all the way to the Springs of Eneglaim, there will be fishermen on the shore of the sea, and they will spread out their nets there to dry. There will be as many different kinds of fish there as there are in the Mediterranean Sea. 
26Ezk 47:11 But the water in the marshes and ponds along the shore will not be made fresh. They will remain there as a source of salt. 
26Ezk 47:12 On each bank of the stream all kinds of trees will grow to provide food. Their leaves will never wither, and they will never stop bearing fruit. They will have fresh fruit every month, because they are watered by the stream that flows from the Temple. The trees will provide food, and their leaves will be used for healing people." 
26Ezk 47:13 The Sovereign LORD said, "These are the boundaries of the land that is to be divided among the twelve tribes, with the tribe of Joseph receiving two sections. 
26Ezk 47:14 I solemnly promised your ancestors that I would give them possession of this land; now divide it equally among you. 
26Ezk 47:15 "The northern boundary runs eastward from the Mediterranean Sea to the city of Hethlon, to Hamath Pass, to the city of Zedad, 
26Ezk 47:16 to the cities of Berothah and Sibraim (they are located between the territory of the kingdom of Damascus and that of the kingdom of Hamath), and to the city of Ticon (located by the border of the district of Hauran). 
26Ezk 47:17 So the northern boundary runs from the Mediterranean eastward to Enon City, with the border regions of Damascus and Hamath to the north of it. 
26Ezk 47:18 "The eastern boundary runs south from a point between the territory of Damascus and that of Hauran, with the Jordan River forming the boundary between the land of Israel on the west and Gilead on the east, as far as Tamar on the Dead Sea. 
26Ezk 47:19 "The southern boundary runs southwest from Tamar to the oasis of Kadesh Meribah and then northwest along the Egyptian border to the Mediterranean Sea. 
26Ezk 47:20 "The western boundary is formed by the Mediterranean and runs north to a point west of Hamath Pass. 
26Ezk 47:21 "Divide this land among your tribes; 
26Ezk 47:22 it is to be your permanent possession. The foreigners who are living among you and who have had children born here are also to receive their share of the land when you divide it. They are to be treated like full Israelite citizens and are to draw lots for shares of the land along with the tribes of Israel. 
26Ezk 47:23 All foreign residents will receive their share with the people of the tribe among whom they are living.
26Ezk 48:2 I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken." 
26Ezk 48:1 The northern boundary of the land runs eastward from the Mediterranean Sea to the city of Hethlon,
26Ezk 48:3 to Hamath Pass, to Enon City, 
26Ezk 48:4 to the boundary between the kingdoms of Damascus and Hamath. 
26Ezk 48:5 Each tribe is to receive one section of land extending from the eastern boundary west to the Mediterranean Sea, 
26Ezk 48:6 in the following order from north to south�� 
26Ezk 48:7 Dan Asher Naphtali Manasseh Ephraim Reuben Judah.
26Ezk 48:8 The next section of the land is to be set apart for special use. It is to be 10 miles wide from north to south, and the same length from east to west as the sections given to the tribes. The Temple will be located within this section. 
26Ezk 48:9 In the center of this section, a special area 10 miles by 8 miles is to be dedicated to the LORD. 
26Ezk 48:10 The priests are to have a portion of this holy area. From east to west their portion is to measure 10 miles, and from north to south, 4 miles. The Temple of the LORD is to be located in the middle of this area. 
26Ezk 48:11 This holy area is to be for the priests who are descendants of Zadok. They served me faithfully and did not join the rest of the Israelites in doing wrong, as the other members of the tribe of Levi did. 
26Ezk 48:12 So they are to have a special area next to the area belonging to the Levites, and it will be the holiest of all. 
26Ezk 48:13 The Levites also are to have a special area, south of that of the priests. It too is to be 10 miles from east to west, by 4 miles from north to south. 
26Ezk 48:14 The area dedicated to the LORD is the best part of all the land, and none of it may be sold or exchanged or transferred to anyone else. It is holy and belongs to the LORD. 
26Ezk 48:15 The part of the special area that is left, 10 miles by 2 miles, is not holy, but is for the general use of the people. They may live there and use the land. The city is to be in the center of it, 
26Ezk 48:16 and it will be a square, 2,520 yards on each side. 
26Ezk 48:17 All around the city on each side there will be an open space 140 yards across. 
26Ezk 48:18 The land that is left after the city has been built in the area immediately to the south of the holy area - 4 miles by 2 miles on the east and 4 miles by 2 miles on the west - is to be used as farmland by the people who live in the city. 
26Ezk 48:19 Anyone who lives in the city, no matter which tribe he comes from, may farm that land. 
26Ezk 48:20 And so the total area in the center of the section which was set apart will be a square measuring 10 miles on each side, and it will include the area occupied by the city. 
26Ezk 48:21 To the east and to the west of this area which contains the Temple, the priests' land, the Levites' land, and the city, the remaining land belongs to the ruling prince. 
26Ezk 48:22 It reaches east to the eastern boundary and west to the Mediterranean Sea, and is bounded on the north by the section belonging to Judah and on the south by the one belonging to Benjamin. 
26Ezk 48:23 South of this special section, 
26Ezk 48:24 each of the remaining tribes is to receive one section of land running from the eastern boundary west to the Mediterranean Sea, 
26Ezk 48:25 in the following order from north to south�� 
26Ezk 48:26 Benjamin Simeon 
26Ezk 48:27 Issachar Zebulun Gad.
26Ezk 48:28 On the south side of the portion given to the tribe of Gad, the boundary runs southwest from Tamar to the oasis of Kadesh, and then northwest along the Egyptian border to the Mediterranean Sea. 
26Ezk 48:29 The Sovereign LORD said, "That is the way the land is to be divided into sections for the tribes of Israel to possess." 
26Ezk 48:30 There are twelve entrances to the city of Jerusalem. 
26Ezk 48:31 Each of the four walls measures 2,520 yards and has three gates in it, each named for one of the tribes. 
26Ezk 48:32 The gates in the north wall are named for Reuben, Judah, and Levi; 
26Ezk 48:33 those in the east wall, for Joseph, Benjamin, and Dan; those in the south wall, for Simeon, Issachar, and Zebulun; 
26Ezk 48:34 and those in the west wall are named for Gad, Asher, and Naphtali. 
26Ezk 48:35 The total length of the wall on all four sides of the city is 10,080 yards. The name of the city from now on will be "The- LORD -Is-Here!"

27Dn 1:1 In the third year that Jehoiakim was king of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylonia attacked Jerusalem and surrounded the city. 
27Dn 1:2 The Lord let him capture King Jehoiakim and seize some of the Temple treasures. He took some prisoners back with him to the temple of his gods in Babylon, and put the captured treasures in the temple storerooms. 
27Dn 1:3 The king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief official, to select from among the Israelite exiles some young men of the royal family and of the noble families. 
27Dn 1:4 They had to be handsome, intelligent, well-trained, quick to learn, and free from physical defects, so that they would be qualified to serve in the royal court. Ashpenaz was to teach them to read and write the Babylonian language. 
27Dn 1:5 The king also gave orders that every day they were to be given the same food and wine as the members of the royal court. After three years of this training they were to appear before the king. 
27Dn 1:6 Among those chosen were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, all of whom were from the tribe of Judah. 
27Dn 1:7 The chief official gave them new names�� Belteshazzar, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. 
27Dn 1:8 Daniel made up his mind not to let himself become ritually unclean by eating the food and drinking the wine of the royal court, so he asked Ashpenaz to help him, 
27Dn 1:9 and God made Ashpenaz sympathetic to Daniel. 
27Dn 1:10 Ashpenaz, however, was afraid of the king, so he said to Daniel, "The king has decided what you are to eat and drink, and if you don't look as fit as the other young men, he may kill me." 
27Dn 1:11 So Daniel went to the guard whom Ashpenaz had placed in charge of him and his three friends. 
27Dn 1:12 "Test us for ten days," he said. "Give us vegetables to eat and water to drink. 
27Dn 1:13 Then compare us with the young men who are eating the food of the royal court, and base your decision on how we look." 
27Dn 1:14 He agreed to let them try it for ten days. 
27Dn 1:15 When the time was up, they looked healthier and stronger than all those who had been eating the royal food. 
27Dn 1:16 So from then on the guard let them continue to eat vegetables instead of what the king provided. 
27Dn 1:17 God gave the four young men knowledge and skill in literature and philosophy. In addition, he gave Daniel skill in interpreting visions and dreams. 
27Dn 1:18 At the end of the three years set by the king, Ashpenaz took all the young men to Nebuchadnezzar. 
27Dn 1:19 The king talked with them all, and Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah impressed him more than any of the others. So they became members of the king's court. 
27Dn 1:20 No matter what question the king asked or what problem he raised, these four knew ten times more than any fortuneteller or magician in his whole kingdom. 
27Dn 1:21 Daniel remained at the royal court until Cyrus, the emperor of Persia, conquered Babylonia. 
27Dn 2:1 In the second year that Nebuchadnezzar was king, he had a dream. It worried him so much that he couldn't sleep, 
27Dn 2:2 so he sent for his fortunetellers, magicians, sorcerers, and wizards to come and explain the dream to him. When they came and stood before the king, 
27Dn 2:3 he said to them, "I'm worried about a dream I've had. I want to know what it means." 
27Dn 2:4 They answered the king in Aramaic, "May Your Majesty live forever! Tell us your dream, and we will explain it to you." 
27Dn 2:5 The king said to them, "I have made up my mind that you must tell me the dream and then tell me what it means. If you can't, I'll have you torn limb from limb and make your houses a pile of ruins. 
27Dn 2:6 But if you can tell me both the dream and its meaning, I will reward you with gifts and great honor. Now then, tell me what the dream was and what it means." 
27Dn 2:7 They answered the king again, "If Your Majesty will only tell us what the dream was, we will explain it." 
27Dn 2:8 At that, the king exclaimed, "Just as I thought! You are trying to gain time, because you see that I have made up my mind 
27Dn 2:9 to give all of you the same punishment if you don't tell me the dream. You have agreed among yourselves to go on telling me lies because you hope that in time things will change. Tell me what the dream was, and then I will know that you can also tell me what it means." 
27Dn 2:10 The advisers replied, "There is no one on the face of the earth who can tell Your Majesty what you want to know. No king, not even the greatest and most powerful, has ever made such a demand of his fortunetellers, magicians, and wizards. 
27Dn 2:11 What Your Majesty is asking for is so difficult that no one can do it for you except the gods, and they do not live among human beings." 
27Dn 2:12 At that, the king flew into a rage and ordered the execution of all the royal advisers in Babylon. 
27Dn 2:13 So the order was issued for all of them to be killed, including Daniel and his friends. 
27Dn 2:14 Then Daniel went to Arioch, commander of the king's bodyguard, who had been ordered to carry out the execution. Choosing his words carefully, 
27Dn 2:15 he asked Arioch why the king had issued such a harsh order. So Arioch told Daniel what had happened. 
27Dn 2:16 Daniel went at once and obtained royal permission for more time, so that he could tell the king what the dream meant. 
27Dn 2:17 Then Daniel went home and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah what had happened. 
27Dn 2:18 He told them to pray to the God of heaven for mercy and to ask him to explain the mystery to them so that they would not be killed along with the other advisers in Babylon. 
27Dn 2:19 Then that same night the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision, and he praised the God of heaven�� 
27Dn 2:20 "God is wise and powerful! Praise him forever and ever. 
27Dn 2:21 He controls the times and the seasons; he makes and unmakes kings; it is he who gives wisdom and understanding. 
27Dn 2:22 He reveals things that are deep and secret; he knows what is hidden in darkness, and he himself is surrounded by light. 
27Dn 2:23 I praise you and honor you, God of my ancestors. You have given me wisdom and strength; you have answered my prayer and shown us what to tell the king." 
27Dn 2:24 So Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had commanded to execute the royal advisers. He said to him, "Don't put them to death. Take me to the king, and I will tell him what his dream means." 
27Dn 2:25 At once Arioch took Daniel into King Nebuchadnezzar's presence and told the king, "I have found one of the Jewish exiles who can tell Your Majesty the meaning of your dream." 
27Dn 2:26 The king said to Daniel (who was also called Belteshazzar), "Can you tell me what I dreamed and what it means?" 
27Dn 2:27 Daniel replied, "Your Majesty, there is no wizard, magician, fortuneteller, or astrologer who can tell you that. 
27Dn 2:28 But there is a God in heaven, who reveals mysteries. He has informed Your Majesty what will happen in the future. Now I will tell you the dream, the vision you had while you were asleep. 
27Dn 2:29 "While Your Majesty was sleeping, you dreamed about the future; and God, who reveals mysteries, showed you what is going to happen. 
27Dn 2:30 Now, this mystery was revealed to me, not because I am wiser than anyone else, but so that Your Majesty may learn the meaning of your dream and understand the thoughts that have come to you. 
27Dn 2:31 "Your Majesty, in your vision you saw standing before you a giant statue, bright and shining, and terrifying to look at. 
27Dn 2:32 Its head was made of the finest gold; its chest and arms were made of silver; its waist and hips of bronze, 
27Dn 2:33 its legs of iron, and its feet partly of iron and partly of clay. 
27Dn 2:34 While you were looking at it, a great stone broke loose from a cliff without anyone touching it, struck the iron and clay feet of the statue, and shattered them. 
27Dn 2:35 At once the iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold crumbled and became like the dust on a threshing place in summer. The wind carried it all away, leaving not a trace. But the stone grew to be a mountain that covered the whole earth. 
27Dn 2:36 "This was the dream. Now I will tell Your Majesty what it means. 
27Dn 2:37 Your Majesty, you are the greatest of all kings. The God of heaven has made you emperor and given you power, might, and honor. 
27Dn 2:38 He has made you ruler of all the inhabited earth and ruler over all the animals and birds. You are the head of gold. 
27Dn 2:39 After you there will be another empire, not as great as yours, and after that a third, an empire of bronze, which will rule the whole earth. 
27Dn 2:40 And then there will be a fourth empire, as strong as iron, which shatters and breaks everything. And just as iron shatters everything, it will shatter and crush all the earlier empires. 
27Dn 2:41 You also saw that the feet and the toes were partly clay and partly iron. This means that it will be a divided empire. It will have something of the strength of iron, because there was iron mixed with the clay. 
27Dn 2:42 The toes - partly iron and partly clay - mean that part of the empire will be strong and part of it weak. 
27Dn 2:43 You also saw that the iron was mixed with the clay. This means that the rulers of that empire will try to unite their families by intermarriage, but they will not be able to, any more than iron can mix with clay. 
27Dn 2:44 At the time of those rulers the God of heaven will establish a kingdom that will never end. It will never be conquered, but will completely destroy all those empires and then last forever. 
27Dn 2:45 You saw how a stone broke loose from a cliff without anyone touching it and how it struck the statue made of iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold. The great God is telling Your Majesty what will happen in the future. I have told you exactly what you dreamed, and have given you its true meaning." 
27Dn 2:46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar bowed to the ground and gave orders for sacrifices and offerings to be made to Daniel. 
27Dn 2:47 The king said, "Your God is the greatest of all gods, the Lord over kings, and the one who reveals mysteries. I know this because you have been able to explain this mystery." 
27Dn 2:48 Then he gave Daniel a high position, presented him with many splendid gifts, put him in charge of the province of Babylon, and made him the head of all the royal advisers. 
27Dn 2:49 At Daniel's request the king put Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego in charge of the affairs of the province of Babylon; Daniel, however, remained at the royal court. 
27Dn 3:1 King Nebuchadnezzar had a gold statue made, ninety feet high and nine feet wide, and he had it set up in the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. 
27Dn 3:2 Then the king gave orders for all his officials to come together - the princes, governors, lieutenant governors, commissioners, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the other officials of the provinces. They were to attend the dedication of the statue which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 
27Dn 3:3 When all these officials gathered for the dedication and stood in front of the statue, 
27Dn 3:4 a herald announced in a loud voice, "People of all nations, races, and languages! 
27Dn 3:5 You will hear the sound of the trumpets, followed by the playing of oboes, lyres, zithers, and harps; and then all the other instruments will join in. As soon as the music starts, you are to bow down and worship the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar has set up. 
27Dn 3:6 Anyone who does not bow down and worship will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace." 
27Dn 3:7 And so, as soon as they heard the sound of the instruments, the people of all the nations, races, and languages bowed down and worshiped the gold statue which King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. 
27Dn 3:8 It was then that some Babylonians took the opportunity to denounce the Jews. 
27Dn 3:9 They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "May Your Majesty live forever! 
27Dn 3:10 Your Majesty has issued an order that as soon as the music starts, everyone is to bow down and worship the gold statue, 
27Dn 3:11 and that anyone who does not bow down and worship it is to be thrown into a blazing furnace. 
27Dn 3:12 There are some Jews whom you put in charge of the province of Babylon - Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego - who are disobeying Your Majesty's orders. They do not worship your god or bow down to the statue you set up." 
27Dn 3:13 At that, the king flew into a rage and ordered the three men to be brought before him. 
27Dn 3:14 He said to them, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, is it true that you refuse to worship my god and to bow down to the gold statue I have set up? 
27Dn 3:15 Now then, as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpets, oboes, lyres, zithers, harps, and all the other instruments, bow down and worship the statue. If you do not, you will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace. Do you think there is any god who can save you?" 
27Dn 3:16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered, "Your Majesty, we will not try to defend ourselves. 
27Dn 3:17 If the God whom we serve is able to save us from the blazing furnace and from your power, then he will. 
27Dn 3:18 But even if he doesn't, Your Majesty may be sure that we will not worship your god, and we will not bow down to the gold statue that you have set up." 
27Dn 3:19 Then Nebuchadnezzar lost his temper, and his face turned red with anger at Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. So he ordered the furnace to be heated seven times hotter than usual. 
27Dn 3:20 And he commanded the strongest men in his army to tie the three men up and throw them into the blazing furnace. 
27Dn 3:21 So they tied them up, fully dressed - shirts, robes, caps, and all - and threw them into the blazing furnace. 
27Dn 3:22 Now because the king had given strict orders for the furnace to be made extremely hot, the flames burned up the guards who took the men to the furnace. 
27Dn 3:23 Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, still tied up, fell into the heart of the blazing fire. 
27Dn 3:24 Suddenly Nebuchadnezzar leaped to his feet in amazement. He asked his officials, "Didn't we tie up three men and throw them into the blazing furnace?" They answered, "Yes, we did, Your Majesty." 
27Dn 3:25 "Then why do I see four men walking around in the fire?" he asked. "They are not tied up, and they show no sign of being hurt - and the fourth one looks like an angel." 
27Dn 3:26 So Nebuchadnezzar went up to the door of the blazing furnace and called out, "Shadrach! Meshach! Abednego! Servants of the Supreme God! Come out!" And they came out at once. 
27Dn 3:27 All the princes, governors, lieutenant governors, and other officials of the king gathered to look at the three men, who had not been harmed by the fire. Their hair was not singed, their clothes were not burned, and there was no smell of smoke on them. 
27Dn 3:28 The king said, "Praise the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent his angel and rescued these men who serve and trust him. They disobeyed my orders and risked their lives rather than bow down and worship any god except their own. 
27Dn 3:29 "And now I command that if anyone of any nation, race, or language speaks disrespectfully of the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, he is to be torn limb from limb, and his house is to be made a pile of ruins. There is no other god who can rescue like this." 
27Dn 3:30 And the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to higher positions in the province of Babylon. 
27Dn 4:1 King Nebuchadnezzar sent the following message to the people of all nations, races, and languages in the world�� "Greetings! 
27Dn 4:2 Listen to my account of the wonders and miracles which the Supreme God has shown me. 
27Dn 4:3 "How great are the wonders God shows us! How powerful are the miracles he performs! God is king forever; he will rule for all time. 
27Dn 4:4 "I was living comfortably in my palace, enjoying great prosperity. 
27Dn 4:5 But I had a frightening dream and saw terrifying visions while I was asleep. 
27Dn 4:6 I ordered all the royal advisers in Babylon to be brought to me so that they could tell me what the dream meant. 
27Dn 4:7 Then all the fortunetellers, magicians, wizards, and astrologers were brought in, and I told them my dream, but they could not explain it to me. 
27Dn 4:8 Then Daniel came in. (He is also called Belteshazzar, after the name of my god.) The spirit of the holy gods is in him, so I told him what I had dreamed. I said to him�� 
27Dn 4:9 Belteshazzar, chief of the fortunetellers, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that you understand all mysteries. This is my dream. Tell me what it means. 
27Dn 4:10 "While I was asleep, I had a vision of a huge tree in the middle of the earth. 
27Dn 4:11 It grew bigger and bigger until it reached the sky and could be seen by everyone in the world. 
27Dn 4:12 Its leaves were beautiful, and it was loaded down with fruit - enough for the whole world to eat. Wild animals rested in its shade, birds built nests in its branches, and every kind of living being ate its fruit. 
27Dn 4:13 "While I was thinking about the vision, I saw coming down from heaven an angel, alert and watchful. 
27Dn 4:14 He proclaimed in a loud voice, 'Cut the tree down and chop off its branches; strip off its leaves and scatter its fruit. Drive the animals from under it and the birds out of its branches. 
27Dn 4:15 But leave the stump in the ground with a band of iron and bronze around it. Leave it there in the field with the grass. " 'Now let the dew fall on this man, and let him live with the animals and the plants. 
27Dn 4:16 For seven years he will not have a human mind, but the mind of an animal. 
27Dn 4:17 This is the decision of the alert and watchful angels. So then, let all people everywhere know that the Supreme God has power over human kingdoms and that he can give them to anyone he chooses - even to those who are least important.' 
27Dn 4:18 "This is the dream I had," said King Nebuchadnezzar. "Now, Belteshazzar, tell me what it means. None of my royal advisers could tell me, but you can, because the spirit of the holy gods is in you." 
27Dn 4:19 At this, Daniel, who is also called Belteshazzar, was so alarmed that he could not say anything. The king said to him, "Belteshazzar, don't let the dream and its message alarm you." Belteshazzar replied, "Your Majesty, I wish that the dream and its explanation applied to your enemies and not to you. 
27Dn 4:20 The tree, so tall that it reached the sky, could be seen by everyone in the world. 
27Dn 4:21 Its leaves were beautiful, and it had enough fruit on it to feed the whole world. Wild animals rested under it, and birds made their nests in its branches. 
27Dn 4:22 "Your Majesty, you are the tree, tall and strong. You have grown so great that you reach the sky, and your power extends over the whole world. 
27Dn 4:23 While Your Majesty was watching, an angel came down from heaven and said, 'Cut the tree down and destroy it, but leave the stump in the ground. Wrap a band of iron and bronze around it, and leave it there in the field with the grass. Let the dew fall on this man, and let him live there with the animals for seven years.' 
27Dn 4:24 "This, then, is what it means, Your Majesty, and this is what the Supreme God has declared will happen to you. 
27Dn 4:25 You will be driven away from human society and will live with wild animals. For seven years you will eat grass like an ox and sleep in the open air, where the dew will fall on you. Then you will admit that the Supreme God controls all human kingdoms and that he can give them to anyone he chooses. 
27Dn 4:26 The angel ordered the stump to be left in the ground. This means that you will become king again when you acknowledge that God rules all the world. 
27Dn 4:27 So then, Your Majesty, follow my advice. Stop sinning, do what is right, and be merciful to the poor. Then you will continue to be prosperous." 
27Dn 4:28 All this did happen to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
27Dn 4:29 Only twelve months later, while he was walking around on the roof of his royal palace in Babylon, 
27Dn 4:30 he said, "Look how great Babylon is! I built it as my capital city to display my power and might, my glory and majesty." 
27Dn 4:31 Before the words were out of his mouth, a voice spoke from heaven, "King Nebuchadnezzar, listen to what I say! Your royal power is now taken away from you. 
27Dn 4:32 You will be driven away from human society, live with wild animals, and eat grass like an ox for seven years. Then you will acknowledge that the Supreme God has power over human kingdoms and that he can give them to anyone he chooses." 
27Dn 4:33 The words came true immediately. Nebuchadnezzar was driven out of human society and ate grass like an ox. The dew fell on his body, and his hair grew as long as eagle feathers and his nails as long as bird claws. 
27Dn 4:34 "When the seven years had passed," said the king, "I looked up at the sky, and my sanity returned. I praised the Supreme God and gave honor and glory to the one who lives forever. "He will rule forever, and his kingdom will last for all time. 
27Dn 4:35 He looks on the people of the earth as nothing; angels in heaven and people on earth are under his control. No one can oppose his will or question what he does. 
27Dn 4:36 "When my sanity returned, my honor, my majesty, and the glory of my kingdom were given back to me. My officials and my noblemen welcomed me, and I was given back my royal power with even greater honor than before. 
27Dn 4:37 "And now, I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise, honor, and glorify the King of Heaven. Everything he does is right and just, and he can humble anyone who acts proudly." 
27Dn 5:1 One night King Belshazzar invited a thousand noblemen to a great banquet, and they drank wine together. 
27Dn 5:2 While they were drinking, Belshazzar gave orders to bring in the gold and silver cups and bowls which his father Nebuchadnezzar had carried off from the Temple in Jerusalem. The king sent for them so that he, his noblemen, his wives, and his concubines could drink out of them. 
27Dn 5:3 At once the gold cups and bowls were brought in, and they all drank wine out of them 
27Dn 5:4 and praised gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone. 
27Dn 5:5 Suddenly a human hand appeared and began writing on the plaster wall of the palace, where the light from the lamps was shining most brightly. And the king saw the hand as it was writing. 
27Dn 5:6 He turned pale and was so frightened that his knees began to shake. 
27Dn 5:7 He shouted for someone to bring in the magicians, wizards, and astrologers. When they came in, the king said to them, "Anyone who can read this writing and tell me what it means will be dressed in robes of royal purple, wear a gold chain of honor around his neck, and be the third in power in the kingdom." 
27Dn 5:8 The royal advisers came forward, but none of them could read the writing or tell the king what it meant. 
27Dn 5:9 In his distress King Belshazzar grew even paler, and his noblemen had no idea what to do. 
27Dn 5:10 The queen mother heard the noise made by the king and his noblemen and entered the banquet hall. She said, "May Your Majesty live forever! Please do not be so disturbed and look so pale. 
27Dn 5:11 There is a man in your kingdom who has the spirit of the holy gods in him. When your father was king, this man showed good sense, knowledge, and wisdom like the wisdom of the gods. And King Nebuchadnezzar, your father, made him chief of the fortunetellers, magicians, wizards, and astrologers. 
27Dn 5:12 He has unusual ability and is wise and skillful in interpreting dreams, solving riddles, and explaining mysteries; so send for this man Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, and he will tell you what all this means." 
27Dn 5:13 Daniel was brought at once into the king's presence, and the king said to him, "Are you Daniel, that Jewish exile whom my father the king brought here from Judah? 
27Dn 5:14 I have heard that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that you are skillful and have knowledge and wisdom. 
27Dn 5:15 The advisers and magicians were brought in to read this writing and tell me what it means, but they could not discover the meaning. 
27Dn 5:16 Now I have heard that you can find hidden meanings and explain mysteries. If you can read this writing and tell me what it means, you will be dressed in robes of royal purple, wear a gold chain of honor around your neck, and be the third in power in the kingdom." 
27Dn 5:17 Daniel replied, "Keep your gifts for yourself or give them to someone else. I will read for Your Majesty what has been written and tell you what it means. 
27Dn 5:18 "The Supreme God made your father Nebuchadnezzar a great king and gave him dignity and majesty. 
27Dn 5:19 He was so great that people of all nations, races, and languages were afraid of him and trembled. If he wanted to kill someone, he did; if he wanted to keep someone alive, he did. He honored or disgraced anyone he wanted to. 
27Dn 5:20 But because he became proud, stubborn, and cruel, he was removed from his royal throne and lost his place of honor. 
27Dn 5:21 He was driven away from human society, and his mind became like that of an animal. He lived with wild donkeys, ate grass like an ox, and slept in the open air with nothing to protect him from the dew. Finally he admitted that the Supreme God controls all human kingdoms and can give them to anyone he chooses. 
27Dn 5:22 "But you, his son, have not humbled yourself, even though you knew all this. 
27Dn 5:23 You acted against the Lord of heaven and brought in the cups and bowls taken from his Temple. You, your noblemen, your wives, and your concubines drank wine out of them and praised gods made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone - gods that cannot see or hear and that do not know anything. But you did not honor the God who determines whether you live or die and who controls everything you do. 
27Dn 5:24 That is why God has sent the hand to write these words. 
27Dn 5:25 "This is what was written�� 'Number, number, weight, divisions.' 
27Dn 5:26 And this is what it means�� number, God has numbered the days of your kingdom and brought it to an end;
27Dn 5:27 weight, you have been weighed on the scales and found to be too light;
27Dn 5:28 divisions, your kingdom is divided up and given to the Medes and Persians."
27Dn 5:29 Immediately Belshazzar ordered his servants to dress Daniel in a robe of royal purple and to hang a gold chain of honor around his neck. And he made him the third in power in the kingdom. 
27Dn 5:30 That same night Belshazzar, the king of Babylonia, was killed; 
27Dn 5:31 and Darius the Mede, who was then sixty-two years old, seized the royal power. 
27Dn 6:1 Darius decided to appoint a hundred and twenty governors to hold office throughout his empire. 
27Dn 6:2 In addition, he chose Daniel and two others to supervise the governors and to look after the king's interests. 
27Dn 6:3 Daniel soon showed that he could do better work than the other supervisors or the governors. Because he was so outstanding, the king considered putting him in charge of the whole empire. 
27Dn 6:4 Then the other supervisors and the governors tried to find something wrong with the way Daniel administered the empire, but they couldn't, because Daniel was reliable and did not do anything wrong or dishonest. 
27Dn 6:5 They said to each other, "We are not going to find anything of which to accuse Daniel unless it is something in connection with his religion." 
27Dn 6:6 So they went to see the king and said, "King Darius, may Your Majesty live forever! 
27Dn 6:7 All of us who administer your empire - the supervisors, the governors, the lieutenant governors, and the other officials - have agreed that Your Majesty should issue an order and enforce it strictly. Give orders that for thirty days no one be permitted to request anything from any god or from any human being except from Your Majesty. Anyone who violates this order is to be thrown into a pit filled with lions. 
27Dn 6:8 So let Your Majesty issue this order and sign it, and it will be in force, a law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed." 
27Dn 6:9 And so King Darius signed the order. 
27Dn 6:10 When Daniel learned that the order had been signed, he went home. In an upstairs room of his house there were windows that faced toward Jerusalem. There, just as he had always done, he knelt down at the open windows and prayed to God three times a day. 
27Dn 6:11 When Daniel's enemies observed him praying to God, 
27Dn 6:12 all of them went together to the king to accuse Daniel. They said, "Your Majesty, you signed an order that for the next thirty days anyone who requested anything from any god or from any human being except you, would be thrown into a pit filled with lions." The king replied, "Yes, that is a strict order, a law of the Medes and Persians, which cannot be changed." 
27Dn 6:13 Then they said to the king, "Daniel, one of the exiles from Judah, does not respect Your Majesty or obey the order you issued. He prays regularly three times a day." 
27Dn 6:14 When the king heard this, he was upset and did his best to find some way to rescue Daniel. He kept trying until sunset. 
27Dn 6:15 Then Daniel's enemies came back to the king and said to him, "Your Majesty knows that according to the laws of the Medes and Persians no order which the king issues can be changed." 
27Dn 6:16 So the king gave orders for Daniel to be taken and thrown into the pit filled with lions. He said to Daniel, "May your God, whom you serve so loyally, rescue you." 
27Dn 6:17 A stone was put over the mouth of the pit, and the king placed his own royal seal and the seal of his noblemen on the stone, so that no one could rescue Daniel. 
27Dn 6:18 Then the king returned to the palace and spent a sleepless night, without food or any form of entertainment. 
27Dn 6:19 At dawn the king got up and hurried to the pit. 
27Dn 6:20 When he got there, he called out anxiously, "Daniel, servant of the living God! Was the God you serve so loyally able to save you from the lions?" 
27Dn 6:21 Daniel answered, "May Your Majesty live forever! 
27Dn 6:22 God sent his angel to shut the mouths of the lions so that they would not hurt me. He did this because he knew that I was innocent and because I have not wronged you, Your Majesty." 
27Dn 6:23 The king was overjoyed and gave orders for Daniel to be pulled up out of the pit. So they pulled him up and saw that he had not been hurt at all, for he trusted God. 
27Dn 6:24 Then the king gave orders to arrest all those who had accused Daniel, and he had them thrown, together with their wives and children, into the pit filled with lions. Before they even reached the bottom of the pit, the lions pounced on them and broke all their bones. 
27Dn 6:25 Then King Darius wrote to the people of all nations, races, and languages on earth�� "Greetings! 
27Dn 6:26 I command that throughout my empire everyone should fear and respect Daniel's God. "He is a living God, and he will rule forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed, and his power will never come to an end. 
27Dn 6:27 He saves and rescues; he performs wonders and miracles in heaven and on earth. He saved Daniel from being killed by the lions." 
27Dn 6:28 Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian. 
27Dn 7:1 In the first year that Belshazzar was king of Babylonia, I had a dream and saw a vision in the night. I wrote the dream down, and this is the record 
27Dn 7:2 of what I saw that night�� Winds were blowing from all directions and lashing the surface of the ocean. 
27Dn 7:3 Four huge beasts came up out of the ocean, each one different from the others. 
27Dn 7:4 The first one looked like a lion, but had wings like an eagle. While I was watching, the wings were torn off. The beast was lifted up and made to stand up straight. And then a human mind was given to it. 
27Dn 7:5 The second beast looked like a bear standing on its hind legs. It was holding three ribs between its teeth, and a voice said to it, "Go on, eat as much meat as you can!" 
27Dn 7:6 While I was watching, another beast appeared. It looked like a leopard, but on its back there were four wings, like the wings of a bird, and it had four heads. It had a look of authority about it. 
27Dn 7:7 As I was watching, a fourth beast appeared. It was powerful, horrible, terrifying. With its huge iron teeth it crushed its victims, and then it trampled on them. Unlike the other beasts, it had ten horns. 
27Dn 7:8 While I was staring at the horns, I saw a little horn coming up among the others. It tore out three of the horns that were already there. This horn had human eyes and a mouth that was boasting proudly. 
27Dn 7:9 While I was looking, thrones were put in place. One who had been living forever sat down on one of the thrones. His clothes were white as snow, and his hair was like pure wool. His throne, mounted on fiery wheels, was blazing with fire, 
27Dn 7:10 and a stream of fire was pouring out from it. There were many thousands of people there to serve him, and millions of people stood before him. The court began its session, and the books were opened. 
27Dn 7:11 While I was looking, I could still hear the little horn bragging and boasting. As I watched, the fourth beast was killed, and its body was thrown into the flames and destroyed. 
27Dn 7:12 The other beasts had their power taken away, but they were permitted to go on living for a limited time. 
27Dn 7:13 During this vision in the night, I saw what looked like a human being. He was approaching me, surrounded by clouds, and he went to the one who had been living forever and was presented to him. 
27Dn 7:14 He was given authority, honor, and royal power, so that the people of all nations, races, and languages would serve him. His authority would last forever, and his kingdom would never end. 
27Dn 7:15 The visions I saw alarmed me, and I was deeply disturbed. 
27Dn 7:16 I went up to one of those standing there and asked him to explain it all. So he told me the meaning. 
27Dn 7:17 He said, "These four huge beasts are four empires which will arise on earth. 
27Dn 7:18 And the people of the Supreme God will receive royal power and keep it forever and ever." 
27Dn 7:19 Then I wanted to know more about the fourth beast, which was not like any of the others - the terrifying beast which crushed its victims with its bronze claws and iron teeth and then trampled on them. 
27Dn 7:20 And I wanted to know about the ten horns on its head and the horn that had come up afterward and had made three of the horns fall. It had eyes and a mouth and was boasting proudly. It was more terrifying than any of the others. 
27Dn 7:21 While I was looking, that horn made war on God's people and conquered them. 
27Dn 7:22 Then the one who had been living forever came and pronounced judgment in favor of the people of the Supreme God. The time had arrived for God's people to receive royal power. 
27Dn 7:23 This is the explanation I was given�� "The fourth beast is a fourth empire that will be on the earth and will be different from all other empires. It will crush the whole earth and trample it down. 
27Dn 7:24 The ten horns are ten kings who will rule that empire. Then another king will appear; he will be very different from the earlier ones and will overthrow three kings. 
27Dn 7:25 He will speak against the Supreme God and oppress God's people. He will try to change their religious laws and festivals, and God's people will be under his power for three and a half years. 
27Dn 7:26 Then the heavenly court will sit in judgment, take away his power, and destroy him completely. 
27Dn 7:27 The power and greatness of all the kingdoms on earth will be given to the people of the Supreme God. Their royal power will never end, and all rulers on earth will serve and obey them." 
27Dn 7:28 This is the end of the account. I was so frightened that I turned pale, and I kept everything to myself. 
27Dn 8:1 In the third year that Belshazzar was king, I saw a second vision. 
27Dn 8:2 In the vision I suddenly found myself in the walled city of Susa in the province of Elam. I was standing by the Ulai River, 
27Dn 8:3 and there beside the river I saw a ram that had two long horns, one of which was longer and newer than the other. 
27Dn 8:4 I watched the ram butting with his horns to the west, the north, and the south. No animal could stop him or escape his power. He did as he pleased and grew arrogant. 
27Dn 8:5 While I was wondering what this meant, a goat came rushing out of the west, moving so fast that his feet didn't touch the ground. He had one prominent horn between his eyes. 
27Dn 8:6 He came toward the ram, which I had seen standing beside the river, and rushed at him with all his force. 
27Dn 8:7 I watched him attack the ram. He was so angry that he smashed into him and broke the two horns. The ram had no strength to resist. He was thrown to the ground and trampled on, and there was no one who could save him. 
27Dn 8:8 The goat grew more and more arrogant, but at the height of his power his horn was broken. In its place four prominent horns came up, each pointing in a different direction. 
27Dn 8:9 Out of one of these four horns grew a little horn, whose power extended toward the south and the east and toward the Promised Land. 
27Dn 8:10 It grew strong enough to attack the army of heaven, the stars themselves, and it threw some of them to the ground and trampled on them. 
27Dn 8:11 It even defied the Prince of the heavenly army, stopped the daily sacrifices offered to him, and ruined the Temple. 
27Dn 8:12 People sinned there instead of offering the proper daily sacrifices, and true religion was thrown to the ground. The horn was successful in everything it did. 
27Dn 8:13 Then I heard one angel ask another, "How long will these things that were seen in the vision continue? How long will an awful sin replace the daily sacrifices? How long will the army of heaven and the Temple be trampled on?" 
27Dn 8:14 I heard the other angel answer, "It will continue for 2,300 evenings and mornings, during which sacrifices will not be offered. Then the Temple will be restored." 
27Dn 8:15 I was trying to understand what the vision meant, when suddenly someone was standing in front of me. 
27Dn 8:16 I heard a voice call out over the Ulai River, "Gabriel, explain to him the meaning of what he saw." 
27Dn 8:17 Gabriel came and stood beside me, and I was so terrified that I fell to the ground. He said to me, "Mortal man, understand the meaning. The vision has to do with the end of the world." 
27Dn 8:18 While he was talking, I fell to the ground unconscious. But he took hold of me, raised me to my feet, 
27Dn 8:19 and said, "I am showing you what the result of God's anger will be. The vision refers to the time of the end. 
27Dn 8:20 "The ram you saw that had two horns represents the kingdoms of Media and Persia. 
27Dn 8:21 The goat represents the kingdom of Greece, and the prominent horn between his eyes is the first king. 
27Dn 8:22 The four horns that came up when the first horn was broken represent the four kingdoms into which that nation will be divided and which will not be as strong as the first kingdom. 
27Dn 8:23 "When the end of those kingdoms is near and they have become so wicked that they must be punished, there will be a stubborn, vicious, and deceitful king. 
27Dn 8:24 He will grow strong - but not by his own power. He will cause terrible destruction and be successful in everything he does. He will bring destruction on powerful men and on God's own people. 
27Dn 8:25 Because he is cunning, he will succeed in his deceitful ways. He will be proud of himself and destroy many people without warning. He will even defy the greatest King of all, but he will be destroyed without the use of any human power. 
27Dn 8:26 This vision about the evening and morning sacrifices which has been explained to you will come true. But keep it secret now, because it will be a long time before it does come true." 
27Dn 8:27 I was depressed and ill for several days. Then I got up and went back to the work that the king had assigned to me, but I was puzzled by the vision and could not understand it. 
27Dn 9:1 Darius the Mede, who was the son of Xerxes, ruled over the kingdom of Babylonia. 
27Dn 9:2 In the first year of his reign I was studying the sacred books and thinking about the seventy years that Jerusalem would be in ruins, according to what the LORD had told the prophet Jeremiah. 
27Dn 9:3 And I prayed earnestly to the Lord God, pleading with him, fasting, wearing sackcloth, and sitting in ashes. 
27Dn 9:4 I prayed to the LORD my God and confessed the sins of my people. I said, "Lord God, you are great, and we honor you. You are faithful to your covenant and show constant love to those who love you and do what you command. 
27Dn 9:5 "We have sinned, we have been evil, we have done wrong. We have rejected what you commanded us to do and have turned away from what you showed us was right. 
27Dn 9:6 We have not listened to your servants the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, our rulers, our ancestors, and our whole nation. 
27Dn 9:7 You, Lord, always do what is right, but we have always brought disgrace on ourselves. This is true of all of us who live in Judea and in Jerusalem and of all the Israelites whom you scattered in countries near and far because they were unfaithful to you. 
27Dn 9:8 Our kings, our rulers, and our ancestors have acted shamefully and sinned against you, Lord. 
27Dn 9:9 You are merciful and forgiving, although we have rebelled against you. 
27Dn 9:10 We did not listen to you, O LORD our God, when you told us to live according to the laws which you gave us through your servants the prophets. 
27Dn 9:11 All Israel broke your laws and refused to listen to what you said. We sinned against you, and so you brought on us the curses that are written in the Law of Moses, your servant. 
27Dn 9:12 You did what you said you would do to us and our rulers. You punished Jerusalem more severely than any other city on earth, 
27Dn 9:13 giving us all the punishment described in the Law of Moses. But even now, O LORD our God, we have not tried to please you by turning from our sins or by following your truth. 
27Dn 9:14 You, O LORD our God, were prepared to punish us, and you did, because you always do what is right, and we did not listen to you. 
27Dn 9:15 "O Lord our God, you showed your power by bringing your people out of Egypt, and your power is still remembered. We have sinned; we have done wrong. 
27Dn 9:16 You have defended us in the past, so do not be angry with Jerusalem any longer. It is your city, your sacred hill. All the people in the neighboring countries look down on Jerusalem and on your people because of our sins and the evil our ancestors did. 
27Dn 9:17 O God, hear my prayer and pleading. Restore your Temple, which has been destroyed; restore it so that everyone will know that you are God. 
27Dn 9:18 Listen to us, O God; look at us and see the trouble we are in and the suffering of the city that bears your name. We are praying to you because you are merciful, not because we have done right. 
27Dn 9:19 Lord, hear us. Lord, forgive us. Lord, listen to us, and act! In order that everyone will know that you are God, do not delay! This city and these people are yours." 
27Dn 9:20 I went on praying, confessing my sins and the sins of my people Israel and pleading with the LORD my God to restore his holy Temple. 
27Dn 9:21 While I was praying, Gabriel, whom I had seen in the earlier vision, came flying down to where I was. It was the time for the evening sacrifice to be offered. 
27Dn 9:22 He explained, "Daniel, I have come here to help you understand the prophecy. 
27Dn 9:23 When you began to plead with God, he answered you. He loves you, and so I have come to tell you the answer. Now pay attention while I explain the vision. 
27Dn 9:24 "Seven times seventy years is the length of time God has set for freeing your people and your holy city from sin and evil. Sin will be forgiven and eternal justice established, so that the vision and the prophecy will come true, and the holy Temple will be rededicated. 
27Dn 9:25 Note this and understand it�� From the time the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem until God's chosen leader comes, seven times seven years will pass. Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and strong defenses, and will stand for seven times sixty-two years, but this will be a time of troubles. 
27Dn 9:26 And at the end of that time God's chosen leader will be killed unjustly. The city and the Temple will be destroyed by the invading army of a powerful ruler. The end will come like a flood, bringing the war and destruction which God has prepared. 
27Dn 9:27 That ruler will have a firm agreement with many people for seven years, and when half this time is past, he will put an end to sacrifices and offerings. The Awful Horror will be placed on the highest point of the Temple and will remain there until the one who put it there meets the end which God has prepared for him." 
27Dn 10:1 In the third year that Cyrus was emperor of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel, who is also called Belteshazzar. The message was true but extremely hard to understand. It was explained to him in a vision. 
27Dn 10:2 At that time I was mourning for three weeks. 
27Dn 10:3 I did not eat any rich food or any meat, drink any wine, or comb my hair until the three weeks were past. 
27Dn 10:4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month of the year I was standing on the bank of the mighty Tigris River. 
27Dn 10:5 I looked up and saw someone who was wearing linen clothes and a belt of fine gold. 
27Dn 10:6 His body shone like a jewel. His face was as bright as a flash of lightning, and his eyes blazed like fire. His arms and legs shone like polished bronze, and his voice sounded like the roar of a great crowd. 
27Dn 10:7 I was the only one who saw the vision. Those who were with me did not see anything, but they were terrified and ran and hid. 
27Dn 10:8 I was left there alone, watching this amazing vision. I had no strength left, and my face was so changed that no one could have recognized me. 
27Dn 10:9 When I heard his voice, I fell to the ground unconscious and lay there face downward. 
27Dn 10:10 Then a hand took hold of me and raised me to my hands and knees; I was still trembling. 
27Dn 10:11 The angel said to me, "Daniel, God loves you. Stand up and listen carefully to what I am going to say. I have been sent to you." When he had said this, I stood up, still trembling. 
27Dn 10:12 Then he said, "Daniel, don't be afraid. God has heard your prayers ever since the first day you decided to humble yourself in order to gain understanding. I have come in answer to your prayer. 
27Dn 10:13 The angel prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me for twenty-one days. Then Michael, one of the chief angels, came to help me, because I had been left there alone in Persia. 
27Dn 10:14 I have come to make you understand what will happen to your people in the future. This is a vision about the future." 
27Dn 10:15 When he said this, I stared at the ground, speechless. 
27Dn 10:16 Then the angel, who looked like a human being, reached out and touched my lips. I said to him, "Sir, this vision makes me so weak that I can't stop trembling. 
27Dn 10:17 I am like a slave standing before his master. How can I talk to you? I have no strength or breath left in me." 
27Dn 10:18 Once more he took hold of me, and I felt stronger. 
27Dn 10:19 He said, "God loves you, so don't let anything worry you or frighten you." When he had said this, I felt even stronger and said, "Sir, tell me what you have to say. You have made me feel better." 
27Dn 10:20 He said, "Do you know why I came to you? It is to reveal to you what is written in the Book of Truth. Now I have to go back and fight the guardian angel of Persia. After that the guardian angel of Greece will appear. 
27Dn 10:21 There is no one to help me except Michael, Israel's guardian angel. 
27Dn 11:1 He is responsible for helping and defending me. 
27Dn 11:2 And what I am now going to tell you is true." The angel said, "Three more kings will rule over Persia, followed by a fourth, who will be richer than all the others. At the height of his power and wealth he will challenge the kingdom of Greece. 
27Dn 11:3 "Then a heroic king will appear. He will rule over a huge empire and do whatever he wants. 
27Dn 11:4 But at the height of his power his empire will break up and be divided into four parts. Kings not descended from him will rule in his place, but they will not have the power that he had. 
27Dn 11:5 "The king of Egypt will be strong. One of his generals, however, will be even stronger and rule a greater kingdom. 
27Dn 11:6 After a number of years the king of Egypt will make an alliance with the king of Syria and give him his daughter in marriage. But the alliance will not last, and she, her husband, her child, and the servants who went with her will all be killed. 
27Dn 11:7 Soon afterward one of her relatives will become king. He will attack the army of the king of Syria, enter their fortress, and defeat them. 
27Dn 11:8 He will carry back to Egypt the images of their gods and the articles of gold and silver dedicated to those gods. After several years of peace 
27Dn 11:9 the king of Syria will invade Egypt, but he will be forced to retreat. 
27Dn 11:10 "The sons of the king of Syria will prepare for war and gather a large army. One of them will sweep on like a flood and attack an enemy fortress. 
27Dn 11:11 In his anger the king of Egypt will go to war against the king of Syria and capture his huge army. 
27Dn 11:12 He will be proud of his victory and of the many soldiers he has killed, but he will not continue to be victorious. 
27Dn 11:13 "The king of Syria will go back and gather a larger army than he had before. When the proper time comes, he will return with a large, well-equipped army. 
27Dn 11:14 Then many people will rebel against the king of Egypt. And some violent people from your nation, Daniel, will rebel because of a vision they have seen, but they will be defeated. 
27Dn 11:15 So the king of Syria will lay siege to a fortified city and capture it. The soldiers of Egypt will not continue to fight; even the best of them will not have enough strength. 
27Dn 11:16 The Syrian invader will do with them as he pleases, without opposition. He will stand in the Promised Land and have it completely in his power. 
27Dn 11:17 "The king of Syria will plan an expedition, using his whole army. Then, in order to destroy his enemy's kingdom, he will make an alliance with him and offer him his daughter in marriage; but his plan will not succeed. 
27Dn 11:18 After that he will attack the nations by the sea and conquer many of them. But a foreign leader will defeat him and put an end to his arrogance; indeed he will turn the arrogance of Syria's king back on him. 
27Dn 11:19 The king will return to the fortresses of his own land, but he will be defeated, and that will be the end of him. 
27Dn 11:20 "He will be followed by another king, who will send an officer to oppress the people with taxes in order to increase the wealth of his kingdom. In a short time that king will be killed, but not publicly and not in battle." 
27Dn 11:21 The angel went on to explain�� "The next king of Syria will be an evil man who has no right to be king, but he will come unexpectedly and seize power by trickery. 
27Dn 11:22 Anyone who opposes him, even God's High Priest, will be swept away and wiped out. 
27Dn 11:23 By making treaties, he will deceive other nations, and he will grow stronger and stronger, even though he rules only a small nation. 
27Dn 11:24 He will invade a wealthy province without warning and will do things that none of his ancestors ever did. Then he will divide among his followers the goods and property he has captured in war. He will make plans to attack fortresses, but his time will soon run out. 
27Dn 11:25 "He will boldly raise a large army to attack the king of Egypt, who will prepare to fight back with a huge and powerful army. But the king of Egypt will be deceived and will not be successful. 
27Dn 11:26 His closest advisers will ruin him. Many of his soldiers will be killed, and his army will be wiped out. 
27Dn 11:27 Then the two kings will sit down to eat at the same table, but their motives will be evil, and they will lie to each other. They will not get what they want, because the time for it has not yet come. 
27Dn 11:28 The king of Syria will return home with all the loot he has captured, determined to destroy the religion of God's people. He will do as he pleases and then return to his own land. 
27Dn 11:29 "Later on he will invade Egypt again, but this time things will turn out differently. 
27Dn 11:30 The Romans will come in ships and oppose him, and he will be frightened. "Then he will turn back in a rage and try to destroy the religion of God's people. He will follow the advice of those who have abandoned that religion. 
27Dn 11:31 Some of his soldiers will make the Temple ritually unclean. They will stop the daily sacrifices and set up The Awful Horror. 
27Dn 11:32 By deceit the king will win the support of those who have already abandoned their religion, but those who follow God will fight back. 
27Dn 11:33 Wise leaders of the people will share their wisdom with many others. But for a while some of them will be killed in battle or be burned to death, and some will be robbed and made prisoners. 
27Dn 11:34 While the killing is going on, God's people will receive a little help, even though many who join them will do so for selfish reasons. 
27Dn 11:35 Some of those wise leaders will be killed, but as a result of this the people will be purified. This will continue until the end comes, the time that God has set. 
27Dn 11:36 "The king of Syria will do as he pleases. He will boast that he is greater than any god, superior even to the Supreme God. He will be able to do this until the time when God punishes him. God will do exactly what he has planned. 
27Dn 11:37 The king will ignore the god his ancestors served, and also the god that women love. In fact, he will ignore every god, because he will think he is greater than any of them. 
27Dn 11:38 Instead, he will honor the god who protects fortresses. He will offer gold, silver, jewels, and other rich gifts to a god his ancestors never worshiped. 
27Dn 11:39 To defend his fortresses, he will use people who worship a foreign god. He will give great honor to those who accept him as ruler, put them into high offices, and give them land as a reward. 
27Dn 11:40 "When the king of Syria's final hour has almost come, the king of Egypt will attack him, and the king of Syria will fight back with all his power, using chariots, horses, and many ships. He will invade many countries, like the waters of a flood. 
27Dn 11:41 He will even invade the Promised Land and kill tens of thousands, but the countries of Edom, Moab, and what is left of Ammon will escape. 
27Dn 11:42 When he invades all those countries, even Egypt will not be spared. 
27Dn 11:43 He will take away Egypt's hidden treasures of gold and silver and its other prized possessions. He will conquer Libya and Ethiopia. 
27Dn 11:44 Then news that comes from the east and the north will frighten him, and he will fight furiously, killing many people. 
27Dn 11:45 He will even set up his huge royal tents between the sea and the mountain on which the Temple stands. But he will die, with no one there to help him." 
27Dn 12:1 The angel wearing linen clothes said, "At that time the great angel Michael, who guards your people, will appear. Then there will be a time of troubles, the worst since nations first came into existence. When that time comes, all the people of your nation whose names are written in God's book will be saved. 
27Dn 12:2 Many of those who have already died will live again�� some will enjoy eternal life, and some will suffer eternal disgrace. 
27Dn 12:3 The wise leaders will shine with all the brightness of the sky. And those who have taught many people to do what is right will shine like the stars forever." 
27Dn 12:4 He said to me, "And now, Daniel, close the book and put a seal on it until the end of the world. Meanwhile, many people will waste their efforts trying to understand what is happening." 
27Dn 12:5 Then I saw two men standing by a river, one on each bank. 
27Dn 12:6 One of them asked the angel who was standing further upstream, "How long will it be until these amazing events come to an end?" 
27Dn 12:7 The angel raised both hands toward the sky and made a solemn promise in the name of the Eternal God. I heard him say, "It will be three and a half years. When the persecution of God's people ends, all these things will have happened." 
27Dn 12:8 I heard what he said, but I did not understand it. So I asked, "But, sir, how will it all end?" 
27Dn 12:9 He answered, "You must go now, Daniel, because these words are to be kept secret and hidden until the end comes. 
27Dn 12:10 Many people will be purified. Those who are wicked will not understand but will go on being wicked; only those who are wise will understand. 
27Dn 12:11 "From the time the daily sacrifices are stopped, that is, from the time of The Awful Horror, 1,290 days will pass. 
27Dn 12:12 Happy are those who remain faithful until 1,335 days are over! 
27Dn 12:13 "And you, Daniel, be faithful to the end. Then you will die, but you will rise to receive your reward at the end of time." 
28
28Hs 1:1 This is the message which the LORD gave Hosea son of Beeri during the time that Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah, and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel. 
28Hs 1:2 When the LORD first spoke to Israel through Hosea, he said to Hosea, "Go and get married; your wife will be unfaithful, and your children will be just like her. In the same way my people have left me and become unfaithful." 
28Hs 1:3 So Hosea married a woman named Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim. After the birth of their first child, a son, 
28Hs 1:4 the LORD said to Hosea, "Name him 'Jezreel,' because it will not be long before I punish the king of Israel for the murders that his ancestor Jehu committed at Jezreel. I am going to put an end to Jehu's dynasty. 
28Hs 1:5 And in Jezreel Valley I will at that time destroy Israel's military power." 
28Hs 1:6 Gomer had a second child - this time it was a daughter. The LORD said to Hosea, "Name her 'Unloved,' because I will no longer show love to the people of Israel or forgive them. 
28Hs 1:7 But to the people of Judah I will show love. I, the LORD their God, will save them, but I will not do it by war - with swords or bows and arrows or with horses and horsemen." 
28Hs 1:8 After Gomer had weaned her daughter, she became pregnant again and had another son. 
28Hs 1:9 The LORD said to Hosea, "Name him 'Not-My-People,' because the people of Israel are not my people, and I am not their God." 
28Hs 1:10 The people of Israel will become like the sand of the sea, more than can be counted or measured. Now God says to them, "You are not my people," but the day is coming when he will say to them, "You are the children of the living God!" 
28Hs 1:11 The people of Judah and the people of Israel will be reunited. They will choose for themselves a single leader, and once again they will grow and prosper in their land. Yes, the day of Jezreel will be a great day! 
28Hs 2:1 So call your fellow Israelites "God's People" and "Loved-by-the-Lord." 
28Hs 2:2 My children, plead with your mother - though she is no longer a wife to me, and I am no longer her husband. Plead with her to stop her adultery and prostitution. 
28Hs 2:3 If she does not, I will strip her as naked as she was on the day she was born. I will make her like a dry and barren land, and she will die of thirst. 
28Hs 2:4 I will not show mercy to her children; they are the children of a shameless prostitute. 
28Hs 2:5 She herself said, "I will go to my lovers - they give me food and water, wool and linen, olive oil and wine." 
28Hs 2:6 So I am going to fence her in with thorn bushes and build a wall to block her way. 
28Hs 2:7 She will run after her lovers but will not catch them. She will look for them but will not find them. Then she will say, "I am going back to my first husband - I was better off then than I am now." 
28Hs 2:8 She would never acknowledge that I am the one who gave her the grain, the wine, the olive oil, and all the silver and gold that she used in the worship of Baal. 
28Hs 2:9 So at harvest time I will take back my gifts of grain and wine, and will take away the wool and the linen I gave her for clothing. 
28Hs 2:10 I will strip her naked in front of her lovers, and no one will be able to save her from my power. 
28Hs 2:11 I will put an end to all her festivities - her annual and monthly festivals and her Sabbath celebrations - all her religious meetings. 
28Hs 2:12 I will destroy her grapevines and her fig trees, which she said her lovers gave her for serving them. I will turn her vineyards and orchards into a wilderness; wild animals will destroy them. 
28Hs 2:13 I will punish her for the times that she forgot me, when she burned incense to Baal and put on her jewelry to go chasing after her lovers. The LORD has spoken. 
28Hs 2:14 So I am going to take her into the desert again; there I will win her back with words of love. 
28Hs 2:15 I will give back to her the vineyards she had and make Trouble Valley a door of hope. She will respond to me there as she did when she was young, when she came from Egypt. 
28Hs 2:16 Then once again she will call me her husband - she will no longer call me her Baal. 
28Hs 2:17 I will never let her speak the name of Baal again. 
28Hs 2:18 At that time I will make a covenant with all the wild animals and birds, so that they will not harm my people. I will also remove all weapons of war from the land, all swords and bows, and will let my people live in peace and safety. 
28Hs 2:19 Israel, I will make you my wife; I will be true and faithful; I will show you constant love and mercy and make you mine forever. 
28Hs 2:20 I will keep my promise and make you mine, and you will acknowledge me as LORD. 
28Hs 2:21 At that time I will answer the prayers of my people Israel. 
28Hs 2:22 I will make rain fall on the earth, and the earth will produce grain and grapes and olives. 
28Hs 2:23 I will establish my people in the land and make them prosper. I will show love to those who were called "Unloved," and to those who were called "Not-My-People" I will say, "You are my people," and they will answer, "You are our God." 
28Hs 3:1 The LORD said to me, "Go again and show your love for a woman who is committing adultery with a lover. You must love her just as I still love the people of Israel, even though they turn to other gods and like to take offerings of raisins to idols." 
28Hs 3:2 So I paid fifteen pieces of silver and seven bushels of barley to buy her. 
28Hs 3:3 I told her that for a long time she would have to wait for me without being a prostitute or committing adultery; and during this time I would wait for her. 
28Hs 3:4 In just this way the people of Israel will have to live for a long time without kings or leaders, without sacrifices or sacred stone pillars, without idols or images to use for divination. 
28Hs 3:5 But the time will come when the people of Israel will once again turn to the LORD their God and to a descendant of David their king. Then they will fear the LORD and will receive his good gifts. 
28Hs 4:1 The LORD has an accusation to bring against the people who live in this land. Listen, Israel, to what he says�� "There is no faithfulness or love in the land, and the people do not acknowledge me as God. 
28Hs 4:2 They make promises and break them; they lie, murder, steal, and commit adultery. Crimes increase, and there is one murder after another. 
28Hs 4:3 And so the land will dry up, and everything that lives on it will die. All the animals and birds, and even the fish, will die." 
28Hs 4:4 The LORD says, "Let no one accuse the people or reprimand them - my complaint is against you priests. 
28Hs 4:5 Night and day you blunder on, and the prophets do no better than you. I am going to destroy Israel, your mother. 
28Hs 4:6 My people are doomed because they do not acknowledge me. You priests have refused to acknowledge me and have rejected my teaching, and so I reject you and will not acknowledge your sons as my priests. 
28Hs 4:7 "The more of you priests there are, the more you sin against me, and so I will turn your honor into disgrace. 
28Hs 4:8 You grow rich from the sins of my people, and so you want them to sin more and more. 
28Hs 4:9 You will suffer the same punishment as the people! I will punish you and make you pay for the evil you do. 
28Hs 4:10 You will eat your share of the sacrifices, but still be hungry. You will worship the fertility gods, but still have no children, because you have turned away from me to follow other gods." 
28Hs 4:11 The LORD says, "Wine, both old and new, is robbing my people of their senses! 
28Hs 4:12 They ask for revelations from a piece of wood! A stick tells them what they want to know! They have left me. Like a woman who becomes a prostitute, they have given themselves to other gods. 
28Hs 4:13 At sacred places on the mountaintops they offer sacrifices, and on the hills they burn incense under tall, spreading trees, because the shade is so pleasant! "As a result, your daughters serve as prostitutes, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery. 
28Hs 4:14 Yet I will not punish them for this, because you yourselves go off with temple prostitutes, and together with them you offer pagan sacrifices. As the proverb says, 'A people without sense will be ruined.' 
28Hs 4:15 "Even though you people of Israel are unfaithful to me, may Judah not be guilty of the same thing. Don't worship at Gilgal or Bethaven, or make promises there in the name of the living LORD. 
28Hs 4:16 The people of Israel are as stubborn as mules. How can I feed them like lambs in a meadow? 
28Hs 4:17 The people of Israel are under the spell of idols. Let them go their own way. 
28Hs 4:18 After drinking much wine, they delight in their prostitution, preferring disgrace to honor. 
28Hs 4:19 They will be carried away as by the wind, and they will be ashamed of their pagan sacrifices. 
28Hs 5:1 "Listen to this, you priests! Pay attention, people of Israel! Listen, you that belong to the royal family! You are supposed to judge with justice - so judgment will fall on you! You have become a trap at Mizpah, a net spread on Mount Tabor, 
28Hs 5:2 a deep pit at Acacia City, and I will punish all of you. 
28Hs 5:3 I know what Israel is like - she cannot hide from me. She has been unfaithful, and her people are unfit to worship me." 
28Hs 5:4 The evil that the people have done keeps them from returning to their God. Idolatry has a powerful hold on them, and they do not acknowledge the LORD. 
28Hs 5:5 The arrogance of the people of Israel cries out against them. Their sins make them stumble and fall, and the people of Judah fall with them. 
28Hs 5:6 They take their sheep and cattle to offer as sacrifices to the LORD, but it does them no good. They cannot find him, for he has left them. 
28Hs 5:7 They have been unfaithful to the LORD; their children do not belong to him. So now they and their lands will soon be destroyed. 
28Hs 5:8 Blow the war trumpets in Gibeah! Sound the alarm in Ramah! Raise the war cry at Bethaven! Into battle, men of Benjamin! 
28Hs 5:9 The day of punishment is coming, and Israel will be ruined. People of Israel, this will surely happen! 
28Hs 5:10 The LORD says, "I am angry because the leaders of Judah have invaded Israel and stolen land from her. So I will pour out punishment on them like a flood. 
28Hs 5:11 Israel is suffering oppression; she has lost land that was rightfully hers, because she insisted on going for help to those who had none to give. 
28Hs 5:12 I will bring destruction on Israel and ruin on the people of Judah. 
28Hs 5:13 "When Israel saw how sick she was and when Judah saw her own wounds, then Israel went to Assyria to ask the great emperor for help, but he could not cure them or heal their wounds. 
28Hs 5:14 I will attack the people of Israel and Judah like a lion. I myself will tear them to pieces and then leave them. When I drag them off, no one will be able to save them. 
28Hs 5:15 "I will abandon my people until they have suffered enough for their sins and come looking for me. Perhaps in their suffering they will try to find me." 
28Hs 6:1 The people say, "Let's return to the LORD! He has hurt us, but he will be sure to heal us; he has wounded us, but he will bandage our wounds, won't he? 
28Hs 6:2 In two or three days he will revive us, and we will live in his presence. 
28Hs 6:3 Let us try to know the LORD. He will come to us as surely as the day dawns, as surely as the spring rains fall upon the earth." 
28Hs 6:4 But the LORD says, "Israel and Judah, what am I going to do with you? Your love for me disappears as quickly as morning mist; it is like dew, that vanishes early in the day. 
28Hs 6:5 That is why I have sent my prophets to you with my message of judgment and destruction. What I want from you is plain and clear�� 
28Hs 6:6 I want your constant love, not your animal sacrifices. I would rather have my people know me than burn offerings to me. 
28Hs 6:7 "But as soon as they entered the land at Adam, they broke the covenant I had made with them. 
28Hs 6:8 Gilead is a city full of evil people and murderers. 
28Hs 6:9 The priests are like a gang of robbers who wait in ambush for someone. Even on the road to the holy place at Shechem they commit murder. And they do all this evil deliberately! 
28Hs 6:10 I have seen a horrible thing in Israel�� my people have defiled themselves by worshiping idols. 
28Hs 6:11 "And as for you, people of Judah, I have set a time to punish you also for what you are doing. 
28Hs 7:1 "Whenever I want to heal my people Israel and make them prosperous again, all I can see is their wickedness and the evil they do. They cheat one another; they break into houses and steal; they rob people in the streets. 
28Hs 7:2 It never enters their heads that I will remember all this evil; but their sins surround them, and I cannot avoid seeing them." 
28Hs 7:3 The LORD says, "People deceive the king and his officers by their evil plots. 
28Hs 7:4 They are all treacherous and disloyal. Their hatred smolders like the fire in an oven, which is not stirred by the baker until the dough is ready to bake. 
28Hs 7:5 On the day of the king's celebration they made the king and his officials drunk and foolish with wine. 
28Hs 7:6 Yes, they burned like an oven with their plotting. All night their anger smoldered, and in the morning it burst into flames. 
28Hs 7:7 "In the heat of their anger they murdered their rulers. Their kings have been assassinated one after another, but no one prays to me for help." 
28Hs 7:8 The LORD says, "The people of Israel are like a half-baked loaf of bread. They rely on the nations around them 
28Hs 7:9 and do not realize that this reliance on foreigners has robbed them of their strength. Their days are numbered, but they don't even know it. 
28Hs 7:10 The arrogance of the people of Israel cries out against them. In spite of everything that has happened, they have not returned to me, the LORD their God. 
28Hs 7:11 Israel flits around like a silly pigeon; first her people call on Egypt for help, and then they run to Assyria! 
28Hs 7:12 But I will spread out a net and catch them like birds as they go by. I will punish them for the evil they have done. 
28Hs 7:13 "They are doomed! They have left me and rebelled against me. They will be destroyed. I wanted to save them, but their worship of me was false. 
28Hs 7:14 They have not prayed to me sincerely, but instead they throw themselves down and wail as the heathen do. When they pray for grain and wine, they gash themselves like pagans. What rebels they are! 
28Hs 7:15 Even though I was the one who brought them up and made them strong, they plotted against me. 
28Hs 7:16 They keep on turning away from me to a god that is powerless. They are as unreliable as a crooked bow. Because their leaders talk arrogantly, they will die a violent death, and the Egyptians will laugh." 
28Hs 8:1 The LORD says, "Sound the alarm! Enemies are swooping down on my land like eagles! My people have broken the covenant I made with them and have rebelled against my teaching. 
28Hs 8:2 Even though they call me their God and claim that they are my people and that they know me, 
28Hs 8:3 they have rejected what is good. Because of this their enemies will pursue them. 
28Hs 8:4 "My people chose kings, but they did it on their own. They appointed leaders, but without my approval. They took their silver and gold and made idols - for their own destruction. 
28Hs 8:5 I hate the gold bull worshiped by the people of the city of Samaria. I am furious with them. How long will it be before they give up their idolatry? 
28Hs 8:6 An Israelite craftsman made the idol, and it is not a god at all! The gold bull worshiped in Samaria will be smashed to pieces! 
28Hs 8:7 When they sow the wind, they will reap a storm! A field of grain that doesn't ripen can never produce any bread. But even if it did, foreigners would eat it up. 
28Hs 8:8 Israel has become like any other nation and is as useless as a broken pot. 
28Hs 8:9 Stubborn as wild donkeys, the people of Israel go their own way. They have gone off to seek help from Assyria and have paid other nations to protect them. 
28Hs 8:10 But now I am going to gather them together and punish them. Soon they will writhe in pain when the emperor of Assyria oppresses them. 
28Hs 8:11 "The more altars the people of Israel build for removing sin, the more places they have for sinning! 
28Hs 8:12 I write down countless teachings for the people, but they reject them as strange and foreign. 
28Hs 8:13 They offer sacrifices to me and eat the meat of the sacrifices. But I, the LORD, am not pleased with them, and now I will remember their sin and punish them for it; I will send them back to Egypt! 
28Hs 8:14 "The people of Israel have built palaces, but they have forgotten their own Maker. The people of Judah have built fortified cities. But I will send fire that will burn down their palaces and their cities." 
28Hs 9:1 People of Israel, stop celebrating your festivals like pagans. You have turned away from your God and have been unfaithful to him. All over the land you have sold yourselves like prostitutes to the god Baal and have loved the grain you thought he paid you with! 
28Hs 9:2 But soon you will not have enough grain and olive oil, and there will be no wine. 
28Hs 9:3 The people of Israel will not remain in the LORD's land, but will have to go back to Egypt and will have to eat forbidden food in Assyria. 
28Hs 9:4 In those foreign lands they will not be able to make wine offerings to the LORD or bring their sacrifices to him. Their food will defile everyone who eats it, like food eaten at funerals. It will be used only to satisfy their hunger; none of it will be taken as an offering to the LORD's Temple. 
28Hs 9:5 And when the time comes for the appointed festivals in honor of the LORD, what will they do then? 
28Hs 9:6 When the disaster comes and the people are scattered, the Egyptians will gather them up - gather them for burial there at Memphis! Their treasures of silver and the places where their homes once stood will be overgrown with weeds and thorn bushes. 
28Hs 9:7 The time for punishment has come, the time when people will get what they deserve. When that happens, Israel will know it! "This prophet," you say, "is a fool. This inspired man is insane." You people hate me so much because your sin is so great. 
28Hs 9:8 God has sent me as a prophet to warn his people Israel. Yet wherever I go, you try to trap me like a bird. Even in God's Temple the people are the prophet's enemies. 
28Hs 9:9 They are hopelessly evil in what they do, just as they were at Gibeah. God will remember their sin and punish them for it. 
28Hs 9:10 The LORD says, "When I first found Israel, it was like finding grapes growing in the desert. When I first saw your ancestors, it was like seeing the first ripe figs of the season. But when they came to Mount Peor, they began to worship Baal and soon became as disgusting as the gods they loved. 
28Hs 9:11 Israel's greatness will fly away like a bird, and there will be no more children born to them, no more women pregnant, no more children conceived. 
28Hs 9:12 But even if they did bring up children, I would take them away and not leave one alive. When I abandon these people, terrible things will happen to them." 
28Hs 9:13 LORD, I can see their children being hunted down and killed. 
28Hs 9:14 What shall I ask you to do to these people? Make their women barren! Make them unable to nurse their babies! 
28Hs 9:15 The LORD says, "All their evildoing began in Gilgal. It was there that I began to hate them. And because of the evil they have done, I will drive them out of my land. I will not love them any more; all their leaders have rebelled against me. 
28Hs 9:16 The people of Israel are like a plant whose roots have dried up and which bears no fruit. They will have no children, but even if they did, I would kill the children so dear to them." 
28Hs 9:17 The God I serve will reject his people, because they have not listened to him. They will become wanderers among the nations. 
28Hs 10:1 The people of Israel were like a grapevine that was full of grapes. The more prosperous they were, the more altars they built. The more productive their land was, the more beautiful they made the sacred stone pillars they worship. 
28Hs 10:2 The people whose hearts are deceitful must now suffer for their sins. God will break down their altars and destroy their sacred pillars. 
28Hs 10:3 These people will soon be saying, "We have no king because we did not fear the LORD. But what could a king do for us anyway?" 
28Hs 10:4 They utter empty words and make false promises and useless treaties. Justice has become injustice, growing like poisonous weeds in a plowed field. 
28Hs 10:5 The people who live in the city of Samaria will be afraid and will mourn the loss of the gold bull at Bethaven. They and the priests who serve the idol will weep over it. They will wail when it is stripped of its golden splendor. 
28Hs 10:6 The idol will be carried off to Assyria as tribute to the great emperor. The people of Israel will be disgraced and put to shame because of the advice they followed. 
28Hs 10:7 Their king will be carried off, like a chip of wood on water. 
28Hs 10:8 The hilltop shrines of Aven, where the people of Israel worship idols, will be destroyed. Thorns and weeds will grow up over their altars. The people will call out to the mountains, "Hide us!" and to the hills, "Cover us!" 
28Hs 10:9 The LORD says, "The people of Israel have not stopped sinning against me since the time of their sin at Gibeah. So at Gibeah war will catch up with them. 
28Hs 10:10 I will attack this sinful people and punish them. Nations will join together against them, and they will be punished for their many sins. 
28Hs 10:11 "Israel was once like a well-trained young cow, ready and willing to thresh grain. But I decided to put a yoke on her beautiful neck and to harness her for harder work. I made Judah pull the plow and Israel pull the harrow. 
28Hs 10:12 I said, 'Plow new ground for yourselves, plant righteousness, and reap the blessings that your devotion to me will produce. It is time for you to turn to me, your LORD, and I will come and pour out blessings upon you.' 
28Hs 10:13 But instead you planted evil and reaped its harvest. You have eaten the fruit produced by your lies. "Because you trusted in your chariots and in the large number of your soldiers, 
28Hs 10:14 war will come to your people, and all your fortresses will be destroyed. It will be like the day when King Shalman destroyed the city of Betharbel in battle, and mothers and their children were crushed to death. 
28Hs 10:15 That is what will happen to you, people of Bethel, because of the terrible evil that you have done. As soon as the battle begins, the king of Israel will die." 
28Hs 11:1 The LORD says, "When Israel was a child, I loved him and called him out of Egypt as my son. 
28Hs 11:2 But the more I called to him, the more he turned away from me. My people sacrificed to Baal; they burned incense to idols. 
28Hs 11:3 Yet I was the one who taught Israel to walk. I took my people up in my arms, but they did not acknowledge that I took care of them. 
28Hs 11:4 I drew them to me with affection and love. I picked them up and held them to my cheek; I bent down to them and fed them. 
28Hs 11:5 "They refuse to return to me, and so they must return to Egypt, and Assyria will rule them. 
28Hs 11:6 War will sweep through their cities and break down the city gates. It will destroy my people because they do what they themselves think best. 
28Hs 11:7 They insist on turning away from me. They will cry out because of the yoke that is on them, but no one will lift it from them. 
28Hs 11:8 "How can I give you up, Israel? How can I abandon you? Could I ever destroy you as I did Admah, or treat you as I did Zeboiim? My heart will not let me do it! My love for you is too strong. 
28Hs 11:9 I will not punish you in my anger; I will not destroy Israel again. For I am God and not a mere human being. I, the Holy One, am with you. I will not come to you in anger. 
28Hs 11:10 "My people will follow me when I roar like a lion at their enemies. They will hurry to me from the west. 
28Hs 11:11 They will come from Egypt, as swiftly as birds, and from Assyria, like doves. I will bring them to their homes again. I, the LORD, have spoken." 
28Hs 11:12 The LORD says, "The people of Israel have surrounded me with lies and deceit, and the people of Judah are still rebelling against me, the faithful and holy God. 
28Hs 12:1 Everything that the people of Israel do from morning to night is useless and destructive. Treachery and acts of violence increase among them. They make treaties with Assyria and do business with Egypt." 
28Hs 12:2 The LORD has an accusation to bring against the people of Judah; he is also going to punish Israel for the way her people act. He will pay them back for what they have done. 
28Hs 12:3 Their ancestor Jacob struggled with his twin brother Esau while the two of them were still in their mother's womb; when Jacob grew up, he fought against God - 
28Hs 12:4 he fought against an angel and won. He wept and asked for a blessing. And at Bethel God came to our ancestor Jacob and spoke with him. 
28Hs 12:5 This was the LORD God Almighty - the LORD is the name by which he is to be worshiped. 
28Hs 12:6 So now, descendants of Jacob, trust in your God and return to him. Be loyal and just, and wait patiently for your God to act. 
28Hs 12:7 The LORD says, "The people of Israel are as dishonest as the Canaanites; they love to cheat their customers with false scales. 
28Hs 12:8 'We are rich,' they say. 'We've made a fortune. And no one can accuse us of getting rich dishonestly.' 
28Hs 12:9 But I, the LORD your God who led you out of Egypt, I will make you live in tents again, as you did when I came to you in the desert. 
28Hs 12:10 "I spoke to the prophets and gave them many visions, and through the prophets I gave my people warnings. 
28Hs 12:11 Yet idols are worshiped in Gilead, and those who worship them will die. Bulls are sacrificed in Gilgal, and the altars there will become piles of stone in the open fields." 
28Hs 12:12 Our ancestor Jacob had to flee to Mesopotamia, where, in order to get a wife, he worked for another man and took care of his sheep. 
28Hs 12:13 The LORD sent a prophet to rescue the people of Israel from slavery in Egypt and to take care of them. 
28Hs 12:14 The people of Israel have made the LORD bitterly angry; they deserve death for their crimes. Their Lord will punish them for the disgrace they have brought on him. 
28Hs 13:1 In the past, when the tribe of Ephraim spoke, the other tribes of Israel were afraid; they looked up to Ephraim. But the people sinned by worshiping Baal, and for this they will die. 
28Hs 13:2 They still keep on sinning by making metal images to worship - idols of silver, designed by human minds, made by human hands. And then they say, "Offer sacrifices to them!" How can anyone kiss those idols - idols in the shape of bulls! 
28Hs 13:3 And so these people will disappear like morning mist, like the dew that vanishes early in the day. They will be like chaff which the wind blows from the threshing place, like smoke from a chimney. 
28Hs 13:4 The LORD says, "I am the LORD your God, who led you out of Egypt. You have no God but me. I alone am your savior. 
28Hs 13:5 I took care of you in a dry, desert land. 
28Hs 13:6 But when you entered the good land, you became full and satisfied, and then you grew proud and forgot me. 
28Hs 13:7 So I will attack you like a lion. Like a leopard I will lie in wait along your path. 
28Hs 13:8 I will attack you like a bear that has lost her cubs, and I will tear you open. Like a lion I will devour you on the spot, and will tear you to pieces like a wild animal. 
28Hs 13:9 "I will destroy you, people of Israel! Then who can help you? 
28Hs 13:10 You asked for a king and for leaders, but how can they save the nation? 
28Hs 13:11 In my anger I have given you kings, and in my fury I have taken them away. 
28Hs 13:12 "Israel's sin and guilt are on record, and the records are safely stored away. 
28Hs 13:13 Israel has a chance to live, but is too foolish to take it - like a child about to be born, who refuses to come out of the womb. 
28Hs 13:14 I will not save this people from the world of the dead or rescue them from the power of death. Bring on your plagues, death! Bring on your destruction, world of the dead! I will no longer have pity for this people. 
28Hs 13:15 Even though Israel flourishes like weeds, I will send a hot east wind from the desert, and it will dry up their springs and wells. It will take away everything of value. 
28Hs 13:16 Samaria must be punished for rebelling against me. Her people will die in war; babies will be dashed to the ground, and pregnant women will be ripped open." 
28Hs 14:1 Return to the LORD your God, people of Israel. Your sin has made you stumble and fall. 
28Hs 14:2 Return to the LORD, and let this prayer be your offering to him�� "Forgive all our sins and accept our prayer, and we will praise you as we have promised. 
28Hs 14:3 Assyria can never save us, and war horses cannot protect us. We will never again say to our idols that they are our God. O LORD, you show mercy to those who have no one else to turn to." 
28Hs 14:4 The LORD says, "I will bring my people back to me. I will love them with all my heart; no longer am I angry with them. 
28Hs 14:5 I will be to the people of Israel like rain in a dry land. They will blossom like flowers; they will be firmly rooted like the trees of Lebanon. 
28Hs 14:6 They will be alive with new growth, and beautiful like olive trees. They will be fragrant like the cedars of Lebanon. 
28Hs 14:7 Once again they will live under my protection. They will grow crops of grain and be fruitful like a vineyard. They will be as famous as the wine of Lebanon. 
28Hs 14:8 The people of Israel will have nothing more to do with idols; I will answer their prayers and take care of them. Like an evergreen tree I will shelter them; I am the source of all their blessings." 
28Hs 14:9 May those who are wise understand what is written here, and may they take it to heart. The LORD's ways are right, and righteous people live by following them, but sinners stumble and fall because they ignore them. 
29
29Jl 1:1 This is the LORD's message to Joel son of Pethuel. 
29Jl 1:2 Pay attention, you older people; everyone in Judah, listen. Has anything like this ever happened in your time or the time of your ancestors? 
29Jl 1:3 Tell your children about it; they will tell their children, who in turn will tell the next generation. 
29Jl 1:4 Swarm after swarm of locusts settled on the crops; what one swarm left, the next swarm devoured. 
29Jl 1:5 Wake up and weep, you drunkards; cry, you wine-drinkers; the grapes for making new wine have been destroyed. 
29Jl 1:6 An army of locusts has attacked our land; they are powerful and too many to count; their teeth are as sharp as those of a lion. 
29Jl 1:7 They have destroyed our grapevines and chewed up our fig trees. They have stripped off the bark, till the branches are white. 
29Jl 1:8 Cry, you people, like a young woman who mourns the death of the man she was going to marry. 
29Jl 1:9 There is no grain or wine to offer in the Temple; the priests mourn because they have no offerings for the LORD. 
29Jl 1:10 The fields are bare; the ground mourns because the grain is destroyed, the grapes are dried up, and the olive trees are withered. 
29Jl 1:11 Grieve, you farmers; cry, you that take care of the vineyards, because the wheat, the barley, yes all the crops are destroyed. 
29Jl 1:12 The grapevines and fig trees have withered; all the fruit trees have wilted and died. The joy of the people is gone. 
29Jl 1:13 Put on sackcloth and weep, you priests who serve at the altar! Go into the Temple and mourn all night! There is no grain or wine to offer your God. 
29Jl 1:14 Give orders for a fast; call an assembly! Gather the leaders and all the people of Judah into the Temple of the LORD your God and cry out to him! 
29Jl 1:15 The day of the LORD is near, the day when the Almighty brings destruction. What terror that day will bring! 
29Jl 1:16 We look on helpless as our crops are destroyed. There is no joy in the Temple of our God. 
29Jl 1:17 The seeds die in the dry earth. There is no grain to be stored, and so the empty granaries are in ruins. 
29Jl 1:18 The cattle are bellowing in distress because there is no pasture for them; the flocks of sheep also suffer. 
29Jl 1:19 I cry out to you, LORD, because the pastures and trees are dried up, as though a fire had burned them. 
29Jl 1:20 Even the wild animals cry out to you because the streams have become dry. 
29Jl 2:1 Blow the trumpet; sound the alarm on Zion, God's sacred hill. Tremble, people of Judah! The day of the LORD is coming soon. 
29Jl 2:2 It will be a dark and gloomy day, a black and cloudy day. The great army of locusts advances like darkness spreading over the mountains. There has never been anything like it, and there never will be again. 
29Jl 2:3 Like fire they eat up the plants. In front of them the land is like the Garden of Eden, but behind them it is a barren desert. Nothing escapes them. 
29Jl 2:4 They look like horses; they run like war-horses. 
29Jl 2:5 As they leap on the tops of the mountains, they rattle like chariots; they crackle like dry grass on fire. They are lined up like a great army ready for battle. 
29Jl 2:6 As they approach, everyone is terrified; every face turns pale. 
29Jl 2:7 They attack like warriors; they climb the walls like soldiers. They all keep marching straight ahead and do not change direction 
29Jl 2:8 or get in each other's way. They swarm through defenses, and nothing can stop them. 
29Jl 2:9 They rush against the city; they run over the walls; they climb up the houses and go in through the windows like thieves. 
29Jl 2:10 The earth shakes as they advance; the sky trembles. The sun and the moon grow dark, and the stars no longer shine. 
29Jl 2:11 The LORD thunders commands to his army. The troops that obey him are many and mighty. How terrible is the day of the LORD! Who will survive it? 
29Jl 2:12 "But even now," says the LORD, "repent sincerely and return to me with fasting and weeping and mourning. 
29Jl 2:13 Let your broken heart show your sorrow; tearing your clothes is not enough." Come back to the LORD your God. He is kind and full of mercy; he is patient and keeps his promise; he is always ready to forgive and not punish. 
29Jl 2:14 Perhaps the LORD your God will change his mind and bless you with abundant crops. Then you can offer him grain and wine. 
29Jl 2:15 Blow the trumpet on Mount Zion; give orders for a fast and call an assembly! 
29Jl 2:16 Gather the people together; prepare them for a sacred meeting; bring the old people; gather the children and the babies too. Even newly married couples must leave their homes and come. 
29Jl 2:17 The priests, serving the LORD between the altar and the entrance of the Temple, must weep and pray�� "Have pity on your people, LORD. Do not let other nations despise us and mock us by saying, 'Where is your God?' " 
29Jl 2:18 Then the LORD showed concern for his land; he had mercy on his people. 
29Jl 2:19 He answered them�� "Now I am going to give you grain and wine and olive oil, and you will be satisfied. Other nations will no longer despise you. 
29Jl 2:20 I will remove the locust army that came from the north and will drive some of them into the desert. Their front ranks will be driven into the Dead Sea, their rear ranks into the Mediterranean. Their dead bodies will stink. I will destroy them because of all they have done to you. 
29Jl 2:21 "Fields, don't be afraid, but be joyful and glad because of all the LORD has done for you. 
29Jl 2:22 Animals, don't be afraid. The pastures are green; the trees bear their fruit, and there are plenty of figs and grapes. 
29Jl 2:23 "Be glad, people of Zion, rejoice at what the LORD your God has done for you. He has given you the right amount of autumn rain; he has poured down the winter rain for you and the spring rain as before. 
29Jl 2:24 The threshing places will be full of grain; the pits beside the presses will overflow with wine and olive oil. 
29Jl 2:25 I will give you back what you lost in the years when swarms of locusts ate your crops. It was I who sent this army against you. 
29Jl 2:26 Now you will have plenty to eat, and be satisfied. You will praise the LORD your God, who has done wonderful things for you. My people will never be despised again. 
29Jl 2:27 Then, Israel, you will know that I am among you and that I, the LORD, am your God and there is no other. My people will never be despised again. 
29Jl 2:28 "Afterward I will pour out my Spirit on everyone�� your sons and daughters will proclaim my message; your old people will have dreams, and your young people will see visions. 
29Jl 2:29 At that time I will pour out my Spirit even on servants, both men and women. 
29Jl 2:30 "I will give warnings of that day in the sky and on the earth; there will be bloodshed, fire, and clouds of smoke. 
29Jl 2:31 The sun will be darkened, and the moon will turn red as blood before the great and terrible day of the LORD comes. 
29Jl 2:32 But all who ask the LORD for help will be saved. As the LORD has said, 'Some in Jerusalem will escape; those whom I choose will survive.' " 
29Jl 3:1 The LORD says, "At that time I will restore the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem. 
29Jl 3:2 I will gather all the nations and bring them to the Valley of Judgment. There I will judge them for all they have done to my people. They have scattered the Israelites in foreign countries and divided Israel, my land. 
29Jl 3:3 They threw dice to decide who would get the captives. They sold boys and girls into slavery to pay for prostitutes and wine. 
29Jl 3:4 "What are you trying to do to me, Tyre, Sidon, and all of Philistia? Are you trying to pay me back for something? If you are, I will quickly pay you back! 
29Jl 3:5 You have taken my silver and gold and carried my rich treasures into your temples. 
29Jl 3:6 You have taken the people of Judah and Jerusalem far from their own country and sold them to the Greeks. 
29Jl 3:7 Now I am going to bring them out of the places to which you have sold them. I will do to you what you have done to them. 
29Jl 3:8 I will let your sons and daughters be sold to the people of Judah; they will sell them to the far-off Sabeans. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
29Jl 3:9 "Make this announcement among the nations�� 'Prepare for war; call your warriors; gather all your soldiers and march! 
29Jl 3:10 Hammer the points of your plows into swords and your pruning knives into spears. Even the weak must fight. 
29Jl 3:11 Hurry and come, all you surrounding nations, and gather in the valley.' " Send down, O LORD, your army to attack them! 
29Jl 3:12 "The nations must get ready and come to the Valley of Judgment. There I, the LORD, will sit to judge all the surrounding nations. 
29Jl 3:13 They are very wicked; cut them down like grain at harvest time; crush them as grapes are crushed in a full wine press until the wine runs over." 
29Jl 3:14 Thousands and thousands are in the Valley of Judgment. It is there that the day of the LORD will soon come. 
29Jl 3:15 The sun and the moon grow dark, and the stars no longer shine. 
29Jl 3:16 The LORD roars from Mount Zion; his voice thunders from Jerusalem; earth and sky tremble. But he will defend his people. 
29Jl 3:17 "Then, Israel, you will know that I am the LORD your God. I live on Zion, my sacred hill. Jerusalem will be a sacred city; foreigners will never conquer it again. 
29Jl 3:18 At that time the mountains will be covered with vineyards, and cattle will be found on every hill; there will be plenty of water for all of Judah. A stream will flow from the Temple of the LORD, and it will water Acacia Valley. 
29Jl 3:19 "Egypt will become a desert, and Edom a ruined waste, because they attacked the land of Judah and killed its innocent people. 
29Jl 3:20 I will avenge those who were killed; I will not spare the guilty.
29Jl 3:21 But Judah and Jerusalem will be inhabited forever, and I, the LORD, will live on Mount Zion."

30Am 1:1 These are the words of Amos, a shepherd from the town of Tekoa. Two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam son of Jehoash was king of Israel, God revealed to Amos all these things about Israel. 
30Am 1:2 Amos said, "The LORD roars from Mount Zion; his voice thunders from Jerusalem. The pastures dry up, and the grass on Mount Carmel turns brown." 
30Am 1:3 The LORD says, "The people of Damascus have sinned again and again, and for this I will certainly punish them. They treated the people of Gilead with savage cruelty. 
30Am 1:4 So I will send fire upon the palace built by King Hazael and I will burn down the fortresses of King Benhadad. 
30Am 1:5 I will smash the city gates of Damascus and remove the inhabitants of Aven Valley and the ruler of Betheden. The people of Syria will be taken away as prisoners to the land of Kir." 
30Am 1:6 The LORD says, "The people of Gaza have sinned again and again, and for this I will certainly punish them. They carried off a whole nation and sold them as slaves to the people of Edom. 
30Am 1:7 So I will send fire upon the city walls of Gaza and burn down its fortresses. 
30Am 1:8 I will remove the rulers of the cities of Ashdod and Ashkelon. I will punish the city of Ekron, and all the Philistines who are left will die." 
30Am 1:9 The LORD says, "The people of Tyre have sinned again and again, and for this I will certainly punish them. They carried off a whole nation into exile in the land of Edom, and did not keep the treaty of friendship they had made. 
30Am 1:10 So I will send fire upon the city walls of Tyre and burn down its fortresses." 
30Am 1:11 The LORD says, "The people of Edom have sinned again and again, and for this I will certainly punish them. They hunted down their relatives, the Israelites, and showed them no mercy. Their anger had no limits, and they never let it die. 
30Am 1:12 So I will send fire upon the city of Teman and burn down the fortresses of Bozrah." 
30Am 1:13 The LORD says, "The people of Ammon have sinned again and again, and for this I will certainly punish them. In their wars for more territory they even ripped open pregnant women in Gilead. 
30Am 1:14 So I will send fire upon the city walls of Rabbah and burn down its fortresses. Then there will be shouts on the day of battle, and the fighting will rage like a storm. 
30Am 1:15 Their king and his officers will go into exile." 
30Am 2:1 The LORD says, "The people of Moab have sinned again and again, and for this I will certainly punish them. They dishonored the bones of the king of Edom by burning them to ashes. 
30Am 2:2 I will send fire upon the land of Moab and burn down the fortresses of Kerioth. The people of Moab will die in the noise of battle while soldiers are shouting and trumpets are sounding. 
30Am 2:3 I will kill the ruler of Moab and all the leaders of the land." 
30Am 2:4 The LORD says, "The people of Judah have sinned again and again, and for this I will certainly punish them. They have despised my teachings and have not kept my commands. They have been led astray by the same false gods that their ancestors served. 
30Am 2:5 So I will send fire upon Judah and burn down the fortresses of Jerusalem." 
30Am 2:6 The LORD says, "The people of Israel have sinned again and again, and for this I will certainly punish them. They sell into slavery honest people who cannot pay their debts, the poor who cannot repay even the price of a pair of sandals. 
30Am 2:7 They trample down the weak and helpless and push the poor out of the way. A man and his father have intercourse with the same slave woman, and so profane my holy name. 
30Am 2:8 At every place of worship people sleep on clothing that they have taken from the poor as security for debts. In the temple of their God they drink wine which they have taken from those who owe them money. 
30Am 2:9 "And yet, my people, it was for your sake that I totally destroyed the Amorites, who were as tall as cedar trees and as strong as oaks. 
30Am 2:10 I brought you out of Egypt, led you through the desert for forty years, and gave you the land of the Amorites to be your own. 
30Am 2:11 I chose some of your sons to be prophets and some of your young men to be nazirites. Isn't this true, people of Israel? I, the LORD, have spoken. 
30Am 2:12 But you made the nazirites drink wine, and ordered the prophets not to speak my message. 
30Am 2:13 And now I will crush you to the ground, and you will groan like a cart loaded with grain. 
30Am 2:14 Not even fast runners will escape; strong men will lose their strength, and soldiers will not be able to save their own lives. 
30Am 2:15 Archers will not stand their ground, fast runners will not get away, and men on horses will not escape with their lives. 
30Am 2:16 On that day even the bravest soldiers will drop their weapons and run." The LORD has spoken. 
30Am 3:1 People of Israel, listen to this message which the LORD has spoken about you, the entire nation that he brought out of Egypt�� 
30Am 3:2 "Of all the nations on earth, you are the only one I have known and cared for. That is what makes your sins so terrible, and that is why I must punish you for them." 
30Am 3:3 Do two people start traveling together without arranging to meet? 
30Am 3:4 Does a lion roar in the forest unless he has found a victim? Does a young lion growl in his den unless he has caught something? 
30Am 3:5 Does a bird get caught in a trap if the trap has not been baited? Does a trap spring unless something sets it off ? 
30Am 3:6 Does the war trumpet sound in a city without making the people afraid? Does disaster strike a city unless the LORD sends it? 
30Am 3:7 The Sovereign LORD never does anything without revealing his plan to his servants, the prophets. 
30Am 3:8 When a lion roars, who can keep from being afraid? When the Sovereign LORD speaks, who can keep from proclaiming his message? 
30Am 3:9 Announce to those who live in the palaces of Egypt and Ashdod�� "Gather together in the hills around Samaria and see the great disorder and the crimes being committed there." 
30Am 3:10 The LORD says, "These people fill their mansions with things taken by crime and violence. They don't even know how to be honest. 
30Am 3:11 And so an enemy will surround their land, destroy their defenses, and plunder their mansions." 
30Am 3:12 The LORD says, "As a shepherd recovers only two legs or an ear of a sheep that a lion has eaten, so only a few will survive of Samaria's people, who now recline on luxurious couches. 
30Am 3:13 Listen now, and warn the descendants of Jacob," says the Sovereign LORD Almighty. 
30Am 3:14 "On the day when I punish the people of Israel for their sins, I will destroy the altars of Bethel. The corners of every altar will be broken off and will fall to the ground. 
30Am 3:15 I will destroy winter houses and summer houses. The houses decorated with ivory will fall in ruins; every large house will be destroyed." 
30Am 4:1 Listen to this, you women of Samaria, who grow fat like the well-fed cows of Bashan, who mistreat the weak, oppress the poor, and demand that your husbands keep you supplied with liquor! 
30Am 4:2 As the Sovereign LORD is holy, he has promised, "The days will come when they will drag you away with hooks; every one of you will be like a fish on a hook. 
30Am 4:3 You will be dragged to the nearest break in the wall and thrown out." 
30Am 4:4 The Sovereign LORD says, "People of Israel, go to the holy place in Bethel and sin, if you must! Go to Gilgal and sin with all your might! Go ahead and bring animals to be sacrificed morning after morning, and bring your tithes every third day. 
30Am 4:5 Go on and offer your bread in thanksgiving to God, and brag about the extra offerings you bring! This is the kind of thing you love to do. 
30Am 4:6 "I was the one who brought famine to all your cities, yet you did not come back to me. 
30Am 4:7 I kept it from raining when your crops needed it most. I sent rain on one city, but not on another. Rain fell on one field, but another field dried up. 
30Am 4:8 Weak with thirst, the people of several cities went to a city where they hoped to find water, but there was not enough to drink. Still you did not come back to me. 
30Am 4:9 "I sent a scorching wind to dry up your crops. The locusts ate up all your gardens and vineyards, your fig trees and olive trees. Still you did not come back to me. 
30Am 4:10 "I sent a plague on you like the one I sent on Egypt. I killed your young men in battle and took your horses away. I filled your nostrils with the stink of dead bodies in your camps. Still you did not come back to me. 
30Am 4:11 "I destroyed some of you as I destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah. Those of you who survived were like a burning stick saved from a fire. Still you did not come back to me," says the LORD. 
30Am 4:12 "So then, people of Israel, I am going to punish you. And because I am going to do this, get ready to face my judgment!" 
30Am 4:13 God is the one who made the mountains and created the winds. He makes his thoughts known to people; he changes day into night. He walks on the heights of the earth. This is his name�� the LORD God Almighty! 
30Am 5:1 Listen, people of Israel, to this funeral song which I sing over you�� 
30Am 5:2 Virgin Israel has fallen, Never to rise again! She lies abandoned on the ground, And no one helps her up. 
30Am 5:3 The Sovereign LORD says, "A city in Israel sends out a thousand soldiers, but only a hundred return; another city sends out a hundred, but only ten come back." 
30Am 5:4 The LORD says to the people of Israel, "Come to me, and you will live. 
30Am 5:5 Do not go to Beersheba to worship. Do not try to find me at Bethel - Bethel will come to nothing. Do not go to Gilgal - her people are doomed to exile." 
30Am 5:6 Go to the LORD, and you will live. If you do not go, he will sweep down like fire on the people of Israel. The fire will burn up the people of Bethel, and no one will be able to put it out. 
30Am 5:7 You are doomed, you that twist justice and cheat people out of their rights! 
30Am 5:8 The LORD made the stars, the Pleiades and Orion. He turns darkness into daylight and day into night. He calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the earth. His name is the LORD. 
30Am 5:9 He brings destruction on the mighty and their strongholds. 
30Am 5:10 You people hate anyone who challenges injustice and speaks the whole truth in court. 
30Am 5:11 You have oppressed the poor and robbed them of their grain. And so you will not live in the fine stone houses you build or drink wine from the beautiful vineyards you plant. 
30Am 5:12 I know how terrible your sins are and how many crimes you have committed. You persecute good people, take bribes, and prevent the poor from getting justice in the courts. 
30Am 5:13 And so, keeping quiet in such evil times is the smart thing to do! 
30Am 5:14 Make it your aim to do what is right, not what is evil, so that you may live. Then the LORD God Almighty really will be with you, as you claim he is. 
30Am 5:15 Hate what is evil, love what is right, and see that justice prevails in the courts. Perhaps the LORD will be merciful to the people of this nation who are still left alive. 
30Am 5:16 And so the Sovereign LORD Almighty says, "There will be wailing and cries of sorrow in the city streets. Even farmers will be called to mourn the dead along with those who are paid to mourn. 
30Am 5:17 There will be wailing in all the vineyards. All this will take place because I am coming to punish you." The LORD has spoken. 
30Am 5:18 How terrible it will be for you who long for the day of the LORD! What good will that day do you? For you it will be a day of darkness and not of light. 
30Am 5:19 It will be like someone who runs from a lion and meets a bear! Or like someone who comes home and puts his hand on the wall - only to be bitten by a snake! 
30Am 5:20 The day of the LORD will bring darkness and not light; it will be a day of gloom, without any brightness. 
30Am 5:21 The LORD says, "I hate your religious festivals; I cannot stand them! 
30Am 5:22 When you bring me burnt offerings and grain offerings, I will not accept them; I will not accept the animals you have fattened to bring me as offerings. 
30Am 5:23 Stop your noisy songs; I do not want to listen to your harps. 
30Am 5:24 Instead, let justice flow like a stream, and righteousness like a river that never goes dry. 
30Am 5:25 "People of Israel, I did not demand sacrifices and offerings during those forty years that I led you through the desert. 
30Am 5:26 But now, because you have worshiped images of Sakkuth, your king god, and of Kaiwan, your star god, you will have to carry those images 
30Am 5:27 when I take you into exile in a land beyond Damascus," says the LORD, whose name is Almighty God. 
30Am 6:1 How terrible it will be for you that have such an easy life in Zion and for you that feel safe in Samaria - you great leaders of this great nation Israel, you to whom the people go for help! 
30Am 6:2 Go and look at the city of Calneh. Then go on to the great city of Hamath and on down to the Philistine city of Gath. Were they any better than the kingdoms of Judah and Israel? Was their territory larger than yours? 
30Am 6:3 You refuse to admit that a day of disaster is coming, but what you do only brings that day closer. 
30Am 6:4 How terrible it will be for you that stretch out on your luxurious couches, feasting on veal and lamb! 
30Am 6:5 You like to compose songs, as David did, and play them on harps. 
30Am 6:6 You drink wine by the bowlful and use the finest perfumes, but you do not mourn over the ruin of Israel. 
30Am 6:7 So you will be the first to go into exile. Your feasts and banquets will come to an end. 
30Am 6:8 The Sovereign LORD Almighty has given this solemn warning�� "I hate the pride of the people of Israel; I despise their luxurious mansions. I will give their capital city and everything in it to the enemy." 
30Am 6:9 If there are ten men left in a family, they will die. 
30Am 6:10 The dead man's relative, the one in charge of the funeral, will take the body out of the house. The relative will call to whoever is still left in the house, "Is anyone else there with you?" The person will answer, "No!" Then the relative will say, "Be quiet! We must be careful not even to mention the LORD's name." 
30Am 6:11 When the LORD gives the command, houses large and small will be smashed to pieces. 
30Am 6:12 Do horses gallop on rocks? Does anyone plow the sea with oxen? Yet you have turned justice into poison, and right into wrong. 
30Am 6:13 You brag about capturing the town of Lodebar. You boast, "We were strong enough to take Karnaim." 
30Am 6:14 The LORD God Almighty himself says, "People of Israel, I am going to send a foreign army to occupy your country. It will oppress you from Hamath Pass in the north to the Brook of the Arabah in the south." 
30Am 7:1 I had a vision from the Sovereign LORD. In it I saw him create a swarm of locusts just after the king's share of the hay had been cut and the grass was starting to grow again. 
30Am 7:2 In my vision I saw the locusts eat up every green thing in the land, and then I said, "Sovereign LORD, forgive your people! How can they survive? They are so small and weak!" 
30Am 7:3 The LORD changed his mind and said, "What you saw will not take place." 
30Am 7:4 I had another vision from the Sovereign LORD. In it I saw him preparing to punish his people with fire. The fire burned up the great ocean under the earth and started to burn up the land. 
30Am 7:5 Then I said, "Stop, O Sovereign LORD! How can your people survive? They are so small and weak!" 
30Am 7:6 The LORD changed his mind again and said, "This will not take place either." 
30Am 7:7 I had another vision from the LORD. In it I saw him standing beside a wall that had been built with the use of a plumb line, and there was a plumb line in his hand. 
30Am 7:8 He asked me, "Amos, what do you see?" "A plumb line," I answered. Then he said, "I am using it to show that my people are like a wall that is out of line. I will not change my mind again about punishing them. 
30Am 7:9 The places where Isaac's descendants worship will be destroyed. The holy places of Israel will be left in ruins. I will bring the dynasty of King Jeroboam to an end." 
30Am 7:10 Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, then sent a report to King Jeroboam of Israel�� "Amos is plotting against you among the people. His speeches will destroy the country. 
30Am 7:11 This is what he says�� 'Jeroboam will die in battle, and the people of Israel will be taken away from their land into exile.' " 
30Am 7:12 Amaziah then said to Amos, "That's enough, prophet! Go on back to Judah and do your preaching there. Let them pay you for it.
30Am 7:13 Don't prophesy here at Bethel any more. This is the king's place of worship, the national temple." 
30Am 7:14 Amos answered, "I am not the kind of prophet who prophesies for pay. I am a herdsman, and I take care of fig trees. 
30Am 7:15 But the LORD took me from my work as a shepherd and ordered me to come and prophesy to his people Israel. 
30Am 7:16 So now listen to what the LORD says. You tell me to stop prophesying, to stop raving against the people of Israel. 
30Am 7:17 And so, Amaziah, the LORD says to you, 'Your wife will become a prostitute in the city, and your children will be killed in war. Your land will be divided up and given to others, and you yourself will die in a heathen country. And the people of Israel will certainly be taken away from their own land into exile.' " 
30Am 8:1 I had another vision from the Sovereign LORD. In it I saw a basket of fruit. 
30Am 8:2 The LORD asked, "Amos, what do you see?" "A basket of fruit," I answered. The LORD said to me, "The end has come for my people Israel. I will not change my mind again about punishing them. 
30Am 8:3 On that day the songs in the palace will become cries of mourning. There will be dead bodies everywhere. They will be cast out in silence." 
30Am 8:4 Listen to this, you that trample on the needy and try to destroy the poor of the country. 
30Am 8:5 You say to yourselves, "We can hardly wait for the holy days to be over so that we can sell our grain. When will the Sabbath end, so that we can start selling again? Then we can overcharge, use false measures, and fix the scales to cheat our customers. 
30Am 8:6 We can sell worthless wheat at a high price. We'll find someone poor who can't pay his debts, not even the price of a pair of sandals, and we'll buy him as a slave." 
30Am 8:7 The LORD, the God of Israel, has sworn, "I will never forget their evil deeds. 
30Am 8:8 And so the earth will quake, and everyone in the land will be in distress. The whole country will be shaken; it will rise and fall like the Nile River. 
30Am 8:9 The time is coming when I will make the sun go down at noon and the earth grow dark in daytime. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
30Am 8:10 I will turn your festivals into funerals and change your glad songs into cries of grief. I will make you shave your heads and wear sackcloth, and you will be like parents mourning for their only child. That day will be bitter to the end. 
30Am 8:11 "The time is coming when I will send famine on the land. People will be hungry, but not for bread; they will be thirsty, but not for water. They will hunger and thirst for a message from the LORD. I, the Sovereign LORD, have spoken. 
30Am 8:12 People will wander from the Dead Sea to the Mediterranean and then on around from the north to the east. They will look everywhere for a message from the LORD, but they will not find it. 
30Am 8:13 On that day even healthy young men and women will collapse from thirst. 
30Am 8:14 Those who swear by the idols of Samaria, who say, 'By the god of Dan' or 'By the god of Beersheba' - those people will fall and not rise again." 
30Am 9:1 I saw the Lord standing by the altar. He gave the command�� "Strike the tops of the Temple columns so hard that the foundation will shake. Break them off and let them fall on the heads of the people. I will kill the rest of the people in war. No one will get away; not one will escape. 
30Am 9:2 Even if they dig their way down to the world of the dead, I will catch them. Even if they climb up to heaven, I will bring them down. 
30Am 9:3 If they hide on the top of Mount Carmel, I will search for them and catch them. If they hide from me at the bottom of the sea, I will command the sea monster to bite them. 
30Am 9:4 If they are taken away into captivity by their enemies, I will order them to be put to death. I am determined to destroy them, not to help them." 
30Am 9:5 The Sovereign LORD Almighty touches the earth, and it quakes; all who live there mourn. The whole world rises and falls like the Nile River. 
30Am 9:6 The LORD builds his home in the heavens, and over the earth he puts the dome of the sky. He calls for the waters of the sea and pours them out on the earth. His name is the LORD! 
30Am 9:7 The LORD says, "People of Israel, I think as much of the people of Ethiopia as I do of you. I brought the Philistines from Crete and the Syrians from Kir, just as I brought you from Egypt. 
30Am 9:8 I, the Sovereign LORD, am watching this sinful kingdom of Israel, and I will destroy it from the face of the earth. But I will not destroy all the descendants of Jacob. 
30Am 9:9 "I will give the command and shake the people of Israel like grain in a sieve. I will shake them among the nations to remove all who are worthless. 
30Am 9:10 The sinners among my people will be killed in war - all those who say, 'God will not let any harm come near us.' " 
30Am 9:11 The LORD says, "A day is coming when I will restore the kingdom of David, which is like a house fallen into ruins. I will repair its walls and restore it. I will rebuild it and make it as it was long ago. 
30Am 9:12 And so the people of Israel will conquer what is left of the land of Edom and all the nations that were once mine," says the LORD, who will cause this to happen. 
30Am 9:13 "The days are coming," says the LORD, "when grain will grow faster than it can be harvested, and grapes will grow faster than the wine can be made. The mountains will drip with sweet wine, and the hills will flow with it. 
30Am 9:14 I will bring my people back to their land. They will rebuild their ruined cities and live there; they will plant vineyards and drink the wine; they will plant gardens and eat what they grow. 
30Am 9:15 I will plant my people on the land I gave them, and they will not be pulled up again." The LORD your God has spoken. 
31
31Ob 1:1 This is the prophecy of Obadiah - what the Sovereign LORD said about the nation of Edom. The LORD has sent his messenger to the nations, and we have heard his message�� "Get ready! Let us go to war against Edom!" 
31Ob 1:1 This is the prophecy of Obadiah - what the Sovereign LORD said about the nation of Edom. The LORD has sent his messenger to the nations, and we have heard his message�� "Get ready! Let us go to war against Edom!" 
31Ob 1:2 The LORD says to Edom, "I will make you weak; everyone will despise you. 
31Ob 1:3 Your pride has deceived you. Your capital is a fortress of solid rock; your home is high in the mountains, and so you say to yourself, 'Who can ever pull me down?' 
31Ob 1:4 Even though you make your home as high as an eagle's nest, so that it seems to be among the stars, yet I will pull you down. 
31Ob 1:5 "When thieves come at night, they take only what they want. When people gather grapes, they always leave a few. But your enemies have wiped you out completely. 
31Ob 1:6 Descendants of Esau, your treasures have been looted. 
31Ob 1:7 Your allies have deceived you; they have driven you from your country. People who were at peace with you have now conquered you. Those friends who ate with you have laid a trap for you; they say of you, 'Where is all that cleverness he had?' 
31Ob 1:8 "On the day I punish Edom, I will destroy their clever men and wipe out all their wisdom. 
31Ob 1:9 The fighting men of Teman will be terrified, and every soldier in Edom will be killed. 
31Ob 1:10 "Because you robbed and killed your relatives, the descendants of Jacob, you will be destroyed and dishonored forever. 
31Ob 1:11 You stood aside on that day when enemies broke down their gates. You were as bad as those strangers who carried off Jerusalem's wealth and divided it among themselves. 
31Ob 1:12 You should not have gloated over the misfortune of your relatives in Judah. You should not have been glad on the day of their ruin. You should not have laughed at them in their distress. 
31Ob 1:13 You should not have entered the city of my people to gloat over their suffering and to seize their riches on the day of their disaster. 
31Ob 1:14 You should not have stood at the crossroads to catch those trying to escape. You should not have handed them over to the enemy on the day of their distress. 
31Ob 1:15 "The day is near when I, the LORD, will judge all nations. Edom, what you have done will be done to you. You will get back what you have given. 
31Ob 1:16 My people have drunk a bitter cup of punishment on my sacred hill. But all the surrounding nations will drink a still more bitter cup of punishment; they will drink it all and vanish away. 
31Ob 1:17 "But on Mount Zion some will escape, and it will be a sacred place. The people of Jacob will possess the land that is theirs by right. 
31Ob 1:18 The people of Jacob and of Joseph will be like fire; they will destroy the people of Esau as fire burns stubble. No descendant of Esau will survive. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
31Ob 1:19 "People from southern Judah will occupy Edom; those from the western foothills will capture Philistia. Israelites will possess the territory of Ephraim and Samaria; the people of Benjamin will take Gilead. 
31Ob 1:20 The army of exiles from northern Israel will return and conquer Phoenicia as far north as Zarephath. The exiles from Jerusalem who are in Sardis will capture the towns of southern Judah. 
31Ob 1:21 The victorious men of Jerusalem will attack Edom and rule over it. And the LORD himself will be king."

32Jnh 1:1 One day the LORD spoke to Jonah son of Amittai. 
32Jnh 1:2 He said, "Go to Nineveh, that great city, and speak out against it; I am aware of how wicked its people are." 
32Jnh 1:3 Jonah, however, set out in the opposite direction in order to get away from the LORD. He went to Joppa, where he found a ship about to go to Spain. He paid his fare and went aboard with the crew to sail to Spain, where he would be away from the LORD. 
32Jnh 1:4 But the LORD sent a strong wind on the sea, and the storm was so violent that the ship was in danger of breaking up. 
32Jnh 1:5 The sailors were terrified and cried out for help, each one to his own god. Then, in order to lessen the danger, they threw the cargo overboard. Meanwhile, Jonah had gone below and was lying in the ship's hold, sound asleep. 
32Jnh 1:6 The captain found him there and said to him, "What are you doing asleep? Get up and pray to your god for help. Maybe he will feel sorry for us and spare our lives." 
32Jnh 1:7 The sailors said to each other, "Let's draw lots and find out who is to blame for getting us into this danger." They did so, and Jonah's name was drawn. 
32Jnh 1:8 So they said to him, "Now, then, tell us! Who is to blame for this? What are you doing here? What country do you come from? What is your nationality?" 
32Jnh 1:9 "I am a Hebrew," Jonah answered. "I worship the LORD, the God of heaven, who made land and sea." 
32Jnh 1:10 Jonah went on to tell them that he was running away from the LORD. The sailors were terrified, and said to him, "That was an awful thing to do!" 
32Jnh 1:11 The storm was getting worse all the time, so the sailors asked him, "What should we do to you to stop the storm?" 
32Jnh 1:12 Jonah answered, "Throw me into the sea, and it will calm down. I know it is my fault that you are caught in this violent storm." 
32Jnh 1:13 Instead, the sailors tried to get the ship to shore, rowing with all their might. But the storm was becoming worse and worse, and they got nowhere. 
32Jnh 1:14 So they cried out to the LORD, "O LORD, we pray, don't punish us with death for taking this man's life! You, O LORD, are responsible for all this; it is your doing." 
32Jnh 1:15 Then they picked Jonah up and threw him into the sea, and it calmed down at once. 
32Jnh 1:16 This made the sailors so afraid of the LORD that they offered a sacrifice and promised to serve him. 
32Jnh 1:17 At the LORD's command a large fish swallowed Jonah, and he was inside the fish for three days and three nights. 
32Jnh 2:1 From deep inside the fish Jonah prayed to the LORD his God�� 
32Jnh 2:2 "In my distress, O LORD, I called to you, and you answered me. From deep in the world of the dead I cried for help, and you heard me. 
32Jnh 2:3 You threw me down into the depths, to the very bottom of the sea, where the waters were all around me, and all your mighty waves rolled over me. 
32Jnh 2:4 I thought I had been banished from your presence and would never see your holy Temple again. 
32Jnh 2:5 The water came over me and choked me; the sea covered me completely, and seaweed wrapped around my head. 
32Jnh 2:6 I went down to the very roots of the mountains, into the land whose gates lock shut forever. But you, O LORD my God, brought me back from the depths alive. 
32Jnh 2:7 When I felt my life slipping away, then, O LORD, I prayed to you, and in your holy Temple you heard me. 
32Jnh 2:8 Those who worship worthless idols have abandoned their loyalty to you. 
32Jnh 2:9 But I will sing praises to you; I will offer you a sacrifice and do what I have promised. Salvation comes from the LORD!" 
32Jnh 2:10 Then the LORD ordered the fish to spit Jonah up on the beach, and it did. 
32Jnh 3:1 Once again the LORD spoke to Jonah. 
32Jnh 3:2 He said, "Go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to the people the message I have given you." 
32Jnh 3:3 So Jonah obeyed the LORD and went to Nineveh, a city so large that it took three days to walk through it. 
32Jnh 3:4 Jonah started through the city, and after walking a whole day, he proclaimed, "In forty days Nineveh will be destroyed!" 
32Jnh 3:5 The people of Nineveh believed God's message. So they decided that everyone should fast, and all the people, from the greatest to the least, put on sackcloth to show that they had repented. 
32Jnh 3:6 When the king of Nineveh heard about it, he got up from his throne, took off his robe, put on sackcloth, and sat down in ashes. 
32Jnh 3:7 He sent out a proclamation to the people of Nineveh�� "This is an order from the king and his officials�� No one is to eat anything; all persons, cattle, and sheep are forbidden to eat or drink. 
32Jnh 3:8 All persons and animals must wear sackcloth. Everyone must pray earnestly to God and must give up their wicked behavior and their evil actions. 
32Jnh 3:9 Perhaps God will change his mind; perhaps he will stop being angry, and we will not die!" 
32Jnh 3:10 God saw what they did; he saw that they had given up their wicked behavior. So he changed his mind and did not punish them as he had said he would. 
32Jnh 4:1 Jonah was very unhappy about this and became angry. 
32Jnh 4:2 So he prayed, " LORD, didn't I say before I left home that this is just what you would do? That's why I did my best to run away to Spain! I knew that you are a loving and merciful God, always patient, always kind, and always ready to change your mind and not punish. 
32Jnh 4:3 Now then, LORD, let me die. I am better off dead than alive." 
32Jnh 4:4 The LORD answered, "What right do you have to be angry?" 
32Jnh 4:5 Jonah went out east of the city and sat down. He made a shelter for himself and sat in its shade, waiting to see what would happen to Nineveh. 
32Jnh 4:6 Then the LORD God made a plant grow up over Jonah to give him some shade, so that he would be more comfortable. Jonah was extremely pleased with the plant. 
32Jnh 4:7 But at dawn the next day, at God's command, a worm attacked the plant, and it died. 
32Jnh 4:8 After the sun had risen, God sent a hot east wind, and Jonah was about to faint from the heat of the sun beating down on his head. So he wished he were dead. "I am better off dead than alive," he said. 
32Jnh 4:9 But God said to him, "What right do you have to be angry about the plant?" Jonah replied, "I have every right to be angry - angry enough to die!" 
32Jnh 4:10 The LORD said to him, "This plant grew up in one night and disappeared the next; you didn't do anything for it and you didn't make it grow - yet you feel sorry for it! 
32Jnh 4:11 How much more, then, should I have pity on Nineveh, that great city. After all, it has more than 120,000 innocent children in it, as well as many animals!"

33Mc 1:1 During the time that Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah, the LORD gave this message to Micah, who was from the town of Moresheth. The LORD revealed to Micah all these things about Samaria and Jerusalem. 
33Mc 1:2 Hear this, all you nations; listen to this, all who live on earth! The Sovereign LORD will testify against you. Listen! He speaks from his heavenly temple. 
33Mc 1:3 The LORD is coming from his holy place; he will come down and walk on the tops of the mountains. 
33Mc 1:4 Then the mountains will melt under him like wax in a fire; they will pour down into the valleys like water pouring down a hill. 
33Mc 1:5 All this will happen because the people of Israel have sinned and rebelled against God. Who is to blame for Israel's rebellion? Samaria, the capital city itself ! Who is guilty of idolatry in Judah? Jerusalem itself ! 
33Mc 1:6 So the LORD says, "I will make Samaria a pile of ruins in the open country, a place for planting grapevines. I will pour the rubble of the city down into the valley, and will lay bare the city's foundations. 
33Mc 1:7 All its precious idols will be smashed to pieces, everything given to its temple prostitutes will be destroyed by fire, and all its images will become a desolate heap. Samaria acquired these things for its fertility rites, and now her enemies will carry them off for temple prostitutes elsewhere." 
33Mc 1:8 Then Micah said, "Because of this I will mourn and lament. To show my sorrow, I will walk around barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and wail like an ostrich. 
33Mc 1:9 Samaria's wounds cannot be healed, and Judah is about to suffer in the same way; destruction has reached the gates of Jerusalem itself, where my people live." 
33Mc 1:10 Don't tell our enemies in Gath about our defeat; don't let them see you weeping. People of Beth Leaphrah, show your despair by rolling in the dust! 
33Mc 1:11 You people of Shaphir, go into exile, naked and ashamed. Those who live in Zaanan do not dare to come out of their city. When you hear the people of Bethezel mourn, you will know that there is no refuge there. 
33Mc 1:12 The people of Maroth anxiously wait for relief, because the LORD has brought disaster close to Jerusalem. 
33Mc 1:13 You that live in Lachish, hitch the horses to the chariots. You imitated the sins of Israel and so caused Jerusalem to sin. 
33Mc 1:14 And now, people of Judah, say good-bye to the town of Moresheth Gath. The kings of Israel will get no help from the town of Achzib. 
33Mc 1:15 People of Mareshah, the LORD will hand you over to an enemy, who is going to capture your town. The leaders of Israel will go and hide in the cave at Adullam. 
33Mc 1:16 People of Judah, cut off your hair in mourning for the children you love. Make yourselves as bald as vultures, because your children will be taken away from you into exile. 
33Mc 2:1 How terrible it will be for those who lie awake and plan evil! When morning comes, as soon as they have the chance, they do the evil they planned. 
33Mc 2:2 When they want fields, they seize them; when they want houses, they take them. No one's family or property is safe. 
33Mc 2:3 And so the LORD says, "I am planning to bring disaster on you, and you will not be able to escape it. You are going to find yourselves in trouble, and then you will not walk so proudly any more. 
33Mc 2:4 When that time comes, people will use the story about you as an example of disaster, and they will sing this song of despair about your experience�� We are completely ruined! The LORD has taken our land away And given it to those who took us captive." 
33Mc 2:5 So then, when the time comes for the land to be given back to the LORD's people, there will be no share for any of you. 
33Mc 2:6 The people preach at me and say, "Don't preach at us. Don't preach about all that. God is not going to disgrace us. 
33Mc 2:7 Do you think the people of Israel are under a curse? Has the LORD lost his patience? Would he really do such things? Doesn't he speak kindly to those who do right?" 
33Mc 2:8 The LORD replies, "You attack my people like enemies. Men return from battle, thinking they are safe at home, but there you are, waiting to steal the coats off their backs. 
33Mc 2:9 You drive the women of my people out of the homes they love, and you have robbed their children of my blessings forever. 
33Mc 2:10 Get up and go; there is no safety here any more. Your sins have doomed this place to destruction. 
33Mc 2:11 "These people want the kind of prophet who goes around full of lies and deceit and says, 'I prophesy that wine and liquor will flow for you.' 
33Mc 2:12 "But I will gather you together, all you people of Israel that are left. I will bring you together like sheep returning to the fold. Like a pasture full of sheep, your land will once again be filled with many people." 
33Mc 2:13 God will open the way for them and lead them out of exile. They will break out of the city gates and go free. Their king, the LORD himself, will lead them out. 
33Mc 3:1 Listen, you rulers of Israel! You are supposed to be concerned about justice, 
33Mc 3:2 yet you hate what is good and you love what is evil. You skin my people alive and tear the flesh off their bones. 
33Mc 3:3 You eat my people up. You strip off their skin, break their bones, and chop them up like meat for the pot. 
33Mc 3:4 The time is coming when you will cry out to the LORD, but he will not answer you. He will not listen to your prayers, for you have done evil. 
33Mc 3:5 My people are deceived by prophets who promise peace to those who pay them, but threaten war for those who don't. To these prophets the LORD says, 
33Mc 3:6 "Prophets, your day is almost over; the sun is going down on you. Because you mislead my people, you will have no more prophetic visions, and you will not be able to predict anything." 
33Mc 3:7 Those who predict the future will be disgraced by their failure. They will all be humiliated because God does not answer them. 
33Mc 3:8 But as for me, the LORD fills me with his spirit and power, and gives me a sense of justice and the courage to tell the people of Israel what their sins are. 
33Mc 3:9 Listen to me, you rulers of Israel, you that hate justice and turn right into wrong. 
33Mc 3:10 You are building God's city, Jerusalem, on a foundation of murder and injustice. 
33Mc 3:11 The city's rulers govern for bribes, the priests interpret the Law for pay, the prophets give their revelations for money - and they all claim that the LORD is with them. "No harm will come to us," they say. "The LORD is with us." 
33Mc 3:12 And so, because of you, Zion will be plowed like a field, Jerusalem will become a pile of ruins, and the Temple hill will become a forest. 
33Mc 4:1 In days to come the mountain where the Temple stands will be the highest one of all, towering above all the hills. Many nations will come streaming to it, 
33Mc 4:2 and their people will say, "Let us go up the hill of the LORD, to the Temple of Israel's God. He will teach us what he wants us to do; we will walk in the paths he has chosen. For the LORD's teaching comes from Jerusalem; from Zion he speaks to his people." 
33Mc 4:3 He will settle disputes among the nations, among the great powers near and far. They will hammer their swords into plows and their spears into pruning knives. Nations will never again go to war, never prepare for battle again. 
33Mc 4:4 Everyone will live in peace among their own vineyards and fig trees, and no one will make them afraid. The LORD Almighty has promised this. 
33Mc 4:5 Each nation worships and obeys its own god, but we will worship and obey the LORD our God forever and ever. 
33Mc 4:6 "The time is coming," says the LORD, "when I will gather together the people I punished, those who have suffered in exile. 
33Mc 4:7 They are crippled and far from home, but I will make a new beginning with those who are left, and they will become a great nation. I will rule over them on Mount Zion from that time on and forever." 
33Mc 4:8 And you, Jerusalem, where God, like a shepherd from his lookout tower, watches over his people, will once again be the capital of the kingdom that was yours. 
33Mc 4:9 Why do you cry out so loudly? Why are you suffering like a woman in labor? Is it because you have no king, and your counselors are dead? 
33Mc 4:10 Twist and groan, people of Jerusalem, like a woman giving birth, for now you will have to leave the city and live in the open country. You will have to go to Babylon, but there the LORD will save you from your enemies. 
33Mc 4:11 Many nations have gathered to attack you. They say, "Jerusalem must be destroyed! We will see this city in ruins!" 
33Mc 4:12 But these nations do not know what is in the LORD's mind. They do not realize that they have been gathered together to be punished in the same way that grain is brought in to be threshed. 
33Mc 4:13 The LORD says, "People of Jerusalem, go and punish your enemies! I will make you as strong as a bull with iron horns and bronze hoofs. You will crush many nations, and the wealth they got by violence you will present to me, the Lord of the whole world." 
33Mc 5:1 People of Jerusalem, gather your forces! We are besieged! They are attacking the leader of Israel! 
33Mc 5:2 The LORD says, "Bethlehem Ephrathah, you are one of the smallest towns in Judah, but out of you I will bring a ruler for Israel, whose family line goes back to ancient times." 
33Mc 5:3 So the LORD will abandon his people to their enemies until the woman who is to give birth has her son. Then those Israelites who are in exile will be reunited with their own people. 
33Mc 5:4 When he comes, he will rule his people with the strength that comes from the LORD and with the majesty of the LORD God himself. His people will live in safety because people all over the earth will acknowledge his greatness, 
33Mc 5:5 and he will bring peace. When the Assyrians invade our country and break through our defenses, we will send our strongest leaders to fight them. 
33Mc 5:6 By force of arms they will conquer Assyria, the land of Nimrod, and they will save us from the Assyrians when they invade our territory. 
33Mc 5:7 The people of Israel who survive will be like refreshing dew sent by the LORD for many nations, like showers on growing plants. They will depend on God, not people. 
33Mc 5:8 Those who are left among the nations will be like a lion hunting for food in a forest or a pasture�� it gets in among the sheep, pounces on them, and tears them to pieces - and there is no hope of rescue. 
33Mc 5:9 Israel will conquer her enemies and destroy them all. 
33Mc 5:10 The LORD says, "At that time I will take away your horses and destroy your chariots. 
33Mc 5:11 I will destroy the cities in your land and tear down all your defenses. 
33Mc 5:12 I will destroy the magic charms you use and leave you without any fortunetellers. 
33Mc 5:13 I will destroy your idols and sacred stone pillars; no longer will you worship the things that you yourselves have made. 
33Mc 5:14 I will pull down the images of the goddess Asherah in your land and destroy your cities. 
33Mc 5:15 And in my great anger I will take revenge on all nations that have not obeyed me."

34Nah 1:1 This is a message about Nineveh, the account of a vision seen by Nahum, who was from Elkosh. 
34Nah 1:2 The LORD God tolerates no rivals; he punishes those who oppose him. In his anger he pays them back. 
34Nah 1:3 The LORD does not easily become angry, but he is powerful and never lets the guilty go unpunished. Where the LORD walks, storms arise; the clouds are the dust raised by his feet! 
34Nah 1:4 He commands the sea, and it dries up! He makes the rivers go dry. The fields of Bashan wither, Mount Carmel turns brown, and the flowers of Lebanon fade. 
34Nah 1:5 Mountains quake in the presence of the LORD; hills melt before him. The earth shakes when the LORD appears; the world and all its people tremble. 
34Nah 1:6 When he is angry, who can survive? Who can survive his terrible fury? He pours out his flaming anger; rocks crumble to dust before him. 
34Nah 1:7 The LORD is good; he protects his people in times of trouble; he takes care of those who turn to him. 
34Nah 1:8 Like a great rushing flood he completely destroys his enemies; he sends to their death those who oppose him. 
34Nah 1:9 What are you plotting against the LORD? He will destroy you. No one opposes him more than once. 
34Nah 1:10 Like tangled thorns and dry straw you drunkards will be burned up! 
34Nah 1:11 From you, Nineveh, there came someone full of wicked schemes, who plotted against the LORD. 
34Nah 1:12 This is what the LORD says to his people Israel�� "Even though the Assyrians are strong and numerous, they will be destroyed and disappear. My people, I made you suffer, but I will not do it again. 
34Nah 1:13 I will now end Assyria's power over you and break the chains that bind you." 
34Nah 1:14 This is what the LORD has decreed about the Assyrians�� "They will have no descendants to carry on their name. I will destroy the idols that are in the temples of their gods. I am preparing a grave for the Assyrians - they don't deserve to live!" 
34Nah 1:15 Look, a messenger is coming over the mountains with good news! He is on his way to announce the victory! People of Judah, celebrate your festivals and give God what you solemnly promised him. The wicked will never invade your land again. They have been totally destroyed! 
34Nah 2:1 Nineveh, you are under attack! The power that will shatter you has come. Prepare the defenses! Guard the road! Prepare for battle! 
34Nah 2:2 (The LORD is about to restore the glory of Israel, as it was before her enemies plundered her.) 
34Nah 2:3 The enemy soldiers carry red shields and wear uniforms of red. They are preparing to attack! Their chariots flash like fire! Their horses prance! 
34Nah 2:4 Chariots dash wildly through the streets, rushing back and forth in the city squares. They flash like torches and dart about like lightning. 
34Nah 2:5 The officers are summoned; they stumble as they press forward. The attackers rush to the wall and set up the shield for the battering ram. 
34Nah 2:6 The gates by the river burst open; the palace is filled with terror. 
34Nah 2:7 The queen is taken captive; her servants moan like doves and beat their breasts in sorrow. 
34Nah 2:8 Like water from a broken dam the people rush from Nineveh! "Stop! Stop!" the cry rings out - but no one turns back. 
34Nah 2:9 Plunder the silver! Plunder the gold! The city is full of treasure! 
34Nah 2:10 Nineveh is destroyed, deserted, desolate! Hearts melt with fear; knees tremble, strength is gone; faces grow pale. 
34Nah 2:11 Where now is the city that was like a den of lions, the place where young lions were fed, where the lion and the lioness would go and their cubs would be safe? 
34Nah 2:12 The lion killed his prey and tore it to pieces for his mate and her cubs; he filled his den with torn flesh. 
34Nah 2:13 "I am your enemy!" says the LORD Almighty. "I will burn up your chariots. Your soldiers will be killed in war, and I will take away everything that you took from others. The demands of your envoys will no longer be heard." 
34Nah 3:1 Doomed is the lying, murderous city, full of wealth to be looted and plundered! 
34Nah 3:2 Listen! The crack of the whip, the rattle of wheels, the gallop of horses, the jolting of chariots! 
34Nah 3:3 Cavalry troops charge, swords flash, spears gleam! Corpses are piled high, dead bodies without number - men stumble over them! 
34Nah 3:4 Nineveh the whore is being punished. Attractive and full of deadly charms, she enchanted nations and enslaved them. 
34Nah 3:5 The LORD Almighty says, "I will punish you, Nineveh! I will strip you naked and let the nations see you, see you in all your shame. 
34Nah 3:6 I will treat you with contempt and cover you with filth. People will stare at you in horror. 
34Nah 3:7 All who see you will shrink back. They will say, 'Nineveh lies in ruins! Who has any sympathy for her? Who will want to comfort her?' " 
34Nah 3:8 Nineveh, are you any better than Thebes, the capital of Egypt? She too had a river to protect her like a wall - the Nile was her defense. 
34Nah 3:9 She ruled Ethiopia and Egypt, there was no limit to her power; Libya was her ally. 
34Nah 3:10 Yet the people of Thebes were carried off into exile. At every street corner their children were beaten to death. Their leading men were carried off in chains and divided among their captors. 
34Nah 3:11 Nineveh, you too will fall into a drunken stupor! You too will try to escape from your enemies. 
34Nah 3:12 All your fortresses will be like fig trees with ripe figs�� shake the trees, and the fruit falls right into your mouth! 
34Nah 3:13 Your soldiers are helpless, and your country stands defenseless before your enemies. Fire will destroy the bars across your gates. 
34Nah 3:14 Draw water to prepare for a siege, and strengthen your fortresses! Trample the clay to make bricks, and get the brick molds ready! 
34Nah 3:15 No matter what you do, you will still be burned to death or killed in battle. You will be wiped out like crops eaten up by locusts. You multiplied like locusts! 
34Nah 3:16 You produced more merchants than there are stars in the sky! But now they are gone, like locusts that spread their wings and fly away. 
34Nah 3:17 Your officials are like a swarm of locusts that stay in the walls on a cold day. But when the sun comes out, they fly away, and no one knows where they have gone! 
34Nah 3:18 Emperor of Assyria, your governors are dead, and your noblemen are asleep forever! Your people are scattered on the mountains, and there is no one to bring them home again. 
34Nah 3:19 There is no remedy for your injuries, and your wounds cannot be healed. All those who hear the news of your destruction clap their hands for joy. Did anyone escape your endless cruelty? 
35
35Hab 1:1 This is the message that the LORD revealed to the prophet Habakkuk. 
35Hab 1:2 O LORD, how long must I call for help before you listen, before you save us from violence? 
35Hab 1:3 Why do you make me see such trouble? How can you stand to look on such wrongdoing? Destruction and violence are all around me, and there is fighting and quarreling everywhere. 
35Hab 1:4 The law is weak and useless, and justice is never done. Evil people get the better of the righteous, and so justice is perverted. 
35Hab 1:5 Then the LORD said to his people, "Keep watching the nations around you, and you will be astonished at what you see. I am going to do something that you will not believe when you hear about it. 
35Hab 1:6 I am bringing the Babylonians to power, those fierce, restless people. They are marching out across the world to conquer other lands. 
35Hab 1:7 They spread fear and terror, and in their pride they are a law to themselves. 
35Hab 1:8 "Their horses are faster than leopards, fiercer than hungry wolves. Their cavalry troops come riding from distant lands; their horses paw the ground. They come swooping down like eagles attacking their prey. 
35Hab 1:9 "Their armies advance in violent conquest, and everyone is terrified as they approach. Their captives are as numerous as grains of sand. 
35Hab 1:10 They treat kings with contempt and laugh at high officials. No fortress can stop them - they pile up earth against it and capture it. 
35Hab 1:11 Then they sweep on like the wind and are gone, these men whose power is their god." 
35Hab 1:12 LORD, from the very beginning you are God. You are my God, holy and eternal. LORD, my God and protector, you have chosen the Babylonians and made them strong so that they can punish us. 
35Hab 1:13 But how can you stand these treacherous, evil men? Your eyes are too holy to look at evil, and you cannot stand the sight of people doing wrong. So why are you silent while they destroy people who are more righteous than they are? 
35Hab 1:14 How can you treat people like fish or like a swarm of insects that have no ruler to direct them? 
35Hab 1:15 The Babylonians catch people with hooks, as though they were fish. They drag them off in nets and shout for joy over their catch! 
35Hab 1:16 They even worship their nets and offer sacrifices to them, because their nets provide them with the best of everything. 
35Hab 1:17 Are they going to use their swords forever and keep on destroying nations without mercy? 
35Hab 2:1 I will climb my watchtower and wait to see what the LORD will tell me to say and what answer he will give to my complaint. 
35Hab 2:2 The LORD gave me this answer�� "Write down clearly on tablets what I reveal to you, so that it can be read at a glance. 
35Hab 2:3 Put it in writing, because it is not yet time for it to come true. But the time is coming quickly, and what I show you will come true. It may seem slow in coming, but wait for it; it will certainly take place, and it will not be delayed. 
35Hab 2:4 And this is the message�� 'Those who are evil will not survive, but those who are righteous will live because they are faithful to God.' " 
35Hab 2:5 Wealth is deceitful. Greedy people are proud and restless - like death itself they are never satisfied. That is why they conquer nation after nation for themselves. 
35Hab 2:6 The conquered people will taunt their conquerors and show their scorn for them. They will say, "You take what isn't yours, but you are doomed! How long will you go on getting rich by forcing your debtors to pay up?" 
35Hab 2:7 But before you know it, you that have conquered others will be in debt yourselves and be forced to pay interest. Enemies will come and make you tremble. They will plunder you! 
35Hab 2:8 You have plundered the people of many nations, but now those who have survived will plunder you because of the murders you have committed and because of your violence against the people of the world and its cities. 
35Hab 2:9 You are doomed! You have made your family rich with what you took by violence, and have tried to make your own home safe from harm and danger! 
35Hab 2:10 But your schemes have brought shame on your family; by destroying many nations you have only brought ruin on yourself. 
35Hab 2:11 Even the stones of the walls cry out against you, and the rafters echo the cry. 
35Hab 2:12 You are doomed! You founded a city on crime and built it up by murder. 
35Hab 2:13 The nations you conquered wore themselves out in useless labor, and all they have built goes up in flames. The LORD Almighty has done this. 
35Hab 2:14 But the earth will be as full of the knowledge of the LORD's glory as the seas are full of water. 
35Hab 2:15 You are doomed! In your fury you humiliated and disgraced your neighbors; you made them stagger as though they were drunk. 
35Hab 2:16 You in turn will be covered with shame instead of honor. You yourself will drink and stagger. The LORD will make you drink your own cup of punishment, and your honor will be turned to disgrace. 
35Hab 2:17 You have cut down the forests of Lebanon; now you will be cut down. You killed its animals; now animals will terrify you. This will happen because of the murders you have committed and because of your violence against the people of the world and its cities. 
35Hab 2:18 What's the use of an idol? It is only something that a human being has made, and it tells you nothing but lies. What good does it do for its maker to trust it - a god that can't even talk! 
35Hab 2:19 You are doomed! You say to a piece of wood, "Wake up!" or to a block of stone, "Get up!" Can an idol reveal anything to you? It may be covered with silver and gold, but there is no life in it. 
35Hab 2:20 The LORD is in his holy Temple; let everyone on earth be silent in his presence. 
35Hab 3:1 This is a prayer of the prophet Habakkuk�� 
35Hab 3:2 O LORD, I have heard of what you have done, and I am filled with awe. Now do again in our times the great deeds you used to do. Be merciful, even when you are angry. 
35Hab 3:3 God is coming again from Edom; the holy God is coming from the hills of Paran. His splendor covers the heavens, and the earth is full of his praise. 
35Hab 3:4 He comes with the brightness of lightning; light flashes from his hand, there where his power is hidden. 
35Hab 3:5 He sends disease before him and commands death to follow him. 
35Hab 3:6 When he stops, the earth shakes; at his glance the nations tremble. The eternal mountains are shattered; the everlasting hills sink down, the hills where he walked in ancient times. 
35Hab 3:7 I saw the people of Cushan afraid and the people of Midian tremble. 
35Hab 3:8 Was it the rivers that made you angry, LORD? Was it the sea that made you furious? You rode upon the clouds; the storm cloud was your chariot, as you brought victory to your people. 
35Hab 3:9 You got ready to use your bow, ready to shoot your arrows. Your lightning split open the earth. 
35Hab 3:10 When the mountains saw you, they trembled; water poured down from the skies. The waters under the earth roared, and their waves rose high. 
35Hab 3:11 At the flash of your speeding arrows and the gleam of your shining spear, the sun and the moon stood still. 
35Hab 3:12 You marched across the earth in anger; in fury you trampled the nations. 
35Hab 3:13 You went out to save your people, to save your chosen king. You struck down the leader of the wicked and completely destroyed his followers. 
35Hab 3:14 Your arrows pierced the commander of his army when it came like a storm to scatter us, gloating like those who secretly oppress the poor. 
35Hab 3:15 You trampled the sea with your horses, and the mighty waters foamed. 
35Hab 3:16 I hear all this, and I tremble; my lips quiver with fear. My body goes limp, and my feet stumble beneath me. I will quietly wait for the time to come when God will punish those who attack us. 
35Hab 3:17 Even though the fig trees have no fruit and no grapes grow on the vines, even though the olive crop fails and the fields produce no grain, even though the sheep all die and the cattle stalls are empty, 
35Hab 3:18 I will still be joyful and glad, because the LORD God is my savior. 
35Hab 3:19 The Sovereign LORD gives me strength. He makes me sure-footed as a deer and keeps me safe on the mountains.

36Zph 1:1 This is the message that the LORD gave to Zephaniah during the time that Josiah son of Amon was king of Judah. (Zephaniah was descended from King Hezekiah through Amariah, Gedaliah, and Cushi.) 
36Zph 1:2 The LORD said, "I am going to destroy everything on earth, 
36Zph 1:3 all human beings and animals, birds and fish. I will bring about the downfall of the wicked. I will destroy everyone, and no survivors will be left. I, the LORD, have spoken. 
36Zph 1:4 "I will punish the people of Jerusalem and of all Judah. I will destroy the last trace of the worship of Baal there, and no one will even remember the pagan priests who serve him. 
36Zph 1:5 I will destroy anyone who goes up on the roof and worships the sun, the moon, and the stars. I will also destroy those who worship me and swear loyalty to me, but then take oaths in the name of the god Molech. 
36Zph 1:6 I will destroy those who have turned back and no longer follow me, those who do not come to me or ask me to guide them." 
36Zph 1:7 The day is near when the LORD will sit in judgment; so be silent in his presence. The LORD is preparing to sacrifice his people and has invited enemies to plunder Judah. 
36Zph 1:8 "On that day of slaughter," says the LORD, "I will punish the officials, the king's sons, and all who practice foreign customs. 
36Zph 1:9 I will punish all who worship like pagans and who steal and kill in order to fill their master's house with loot. 
36Zph 1:10 "On that day," says the LORD, "you will hear the sound of crying at the Fish Gate in Jerusalem. You will hear wailing in the newer part of the city and a great crashing sound in the hills. 
36Zph 1:11 Wail and cry when you hear this, you that live in the lower part of the city, because all the merchants will be dead! 
36Zph 1:12 "At that time I will take a lamp and search Jerusalem. I will punish the people who are self-satisfied and confident, who say to themselves, 'The LORD never does anything, one way or the other.' 
36Zph 1:13 Their wealth will be looted and their houses destroyed. They will never live in the houses they are building or drink wine from the vineyards they are planting." 
36Zph 1:14 The great day of the LORD is near - very near and coming fast! That day will be bitter, for even the bravest soldiers will cry out in despair! 
36Zph 1:15 It will be a day of fury, a day of trouble and distress, a day of ruin and destruction, a day of darkness and gloom, a black and cloudy day, 
36Zph 1:16 a day filled with the sound of war trumpets and the battle cry of soldiers attacking fortified cities and high towers. 
36Zph 1:17 The LORD says, "I will bring such disasters on the human race that everyone will grope about like someone blind. They have sinned against me, and now their blood will be poured out like water, and their dead bodies will lie rotting on the ground." 
36Zph 1:18 On the day when the LORD shows his fury, not even all their silver and gold will save them. The whole earth will be destroyed by the fire of his anger. He will put an end - a sudden end - to everyone who lives on earth. 
36Zph 2:1 Shameless nation, come to your senses 
36Zph 2:2 before you are driven away like chaff blown by the wind, before the burning anger of the LORD comes upon you, before the day when he shows his fury. 
36Zph 2:3 Turn to the LORD, all you humble people of the land, who obey his commands. Do what is right, and humble yourselves before the LORD. Perhaps you will escape punishment on the day when the LORD shows his anger. 
36Zph 2:4 No one will be left in the city of Gaza. Ashkelon will be deserted. The people of Ashdod will be driven out in half a day, and the people of Ekron will be driven from their city. 
36Zph 2:5 You Philistines are doomed, you people who live along the coast. The LORD has passed sentence on you. He will destroy you, and not one of you will be left. 
36Zph 2:6 Your land by the sea will become open fields with shepherd's huts and sheep pens. 
36Zph 2:7 The people of Judah who survive will occupy your land. They will pasture their flocks there and sleep in the houses of Ashkelon. The LORD their God will be with them and make them prosper again. 
36Zph 2:8 The LORD Almighty says, "I have heard the people of Moab and Ammon insulting and taunting my people, and boasting that they would seize their land. 
36Zph 2:9 As surely as I am the living LORD, the God of Israel, I swear that Moab and Ammon are going to be destroyed like Sodom and Gomorrah. They will become a place of salt pits and everlasting ruin, overgrown with weeds. Those of my people who survive will plunder them and take their land." 
36Zph 2:10 That is how the people of Moab and Ammon will be punished for their pride and arrogance and for insulting the people of the LORD Almighty. 
36Zph 2:11 The LORD will terrify them. He will reduce the gods of the earth to nothing, and then every nation will worship him, each in its own land. 
36Zph 2:12 The LORD will also put the people of Ethiopia to death. 
36Zph 2:13 The LORD will use his power to destroy Assyria. He will make the city of Nineveh a deserted ruin, a waterless desert. 
36Zph 2:14 It will be a place where flocks, herds, and animals of every kind will lie down. Owls will live among its ruins and hoot from the windows. Crows will caw on the doorsteps. The cedar wood of her buildings will be stripped away. 
36Zph 2:15 That is what will happen to the city that is so proud of its own power and thinks it is safe. Its people think that their city is the greatest in the world. What a desolate place it will become, a place where wild animals will rest! Everyone who passes by will shrink back in horror. 
36Zph 3:1 Jerusalem is doomed, that corrupt, rebellious city that oppresses its own people. 
36Zph 3:2 It has not listened to the LORD or accepted his discipline. It has not put its trust in the LORD or asked for his help. 
36Zph 3:3 Its officials are like roaring lions; its judges are like hungry wolves, too greedy to leave a bone until morning. 
36Zph 3:4 The prophets are irresponsible and treacherous; the priests defile what is sacred, and twist the law of God to their own advantage. 
36Zph 3:5 But the LORD is still in the city; he does what is right and never what is wrong. Every morning without fail, he brings justice to his people. And yet the unrighteous people there keep on doing wrong and are not ashamed. 
36Zph 3:6 The LORD says, "I have wiped out whole nations; I have destroyed their cities and left their walls and towers in ruins. The cities are deserted; the streets are empty - no one is left. 
36Zph 3:7 I thought that then my people would have reverence for me and accept my discipline, that they would never forget the lesson I taught them. But soon they were behaving as badly as ever. 
36Zph 3:8 "Just wait," the LORD says. "Wait for the day when I rise to accuse the nations. I have made up my mind to gather nations and kingdoms in order to let them feel the force of my anger. The whole earth will be destroyed by the fire of my fury. 
36Zph 3:9 "Then I will change the people of the nations, and they will pray to me alone and not to other gods. They will all obey me. 
36Zph 3:10 Even from distant Ethiopia my scattered people will bring offerings to me. 
36Zph 3:11 At that time you, my people, will no longer need to be ashamed that you rebelled against me. I will remove everyone who is proud and arrogant, and you will never again rebel against me on my sacred hill. 
36Zph 3:12 I will leave there a humble and lowly people, who will come to me for help. 
36Zph 3:13 The people of Israel who survive will do no wrong to anyone, tell no lies, nor try to deceive. They will be prosperous and secure, afraid of no one." 
36Zph 3:14 Sing and shout for joy, people of Israel! Rejoice with all your heart, Jerusalem! 
36Zph 3:15 The LORD has stopped your punishment; he has removed all your enemies. The LORD, the king of Israel, is with you; there is no reason now to be afraid. 
36Zph 3:16 The time is coming when they will say to Jerusalem, "Do not be afraid, city of Zion! Do not let your hands hang limp! 
36Zph 3:17 The LORD your God is with you; his power gives you victory. The LORD will take delight in you, and in his love he will give you new life. He will sing and be joyful over you, 
36Zph 3:18 as joyful as people at a festival." The LORD says, "I have ended the threat of doom and taken away your disgrace. 
36Zph 3:19 The time is coming! I will punish your oppressors; I will rescue all the lame and bring the exiles home. I will turn their shame to honor, and all the world will praise them. 
36Zph 3:20 The time is coming! I will bring your scattered people home; I will make you famous throughout the world and make you prosperous once again." The LORD has spoken.

37Hg 1:1 During the second year that Darius was emperor of Persia, on the first day of the sixth month, the LORD spoke through the prophet Haggai. The message was for the governor of Judah, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and for the High Priest, Joshua son of Jehozadak. 
37Hg 1:2 The LORD Almighty said to Haggai, "These people say that this is not the right time to rebuild the Temple." 
37Hg 1:3 The LORD then gave this message to the people through the prophet Haggai�� 
37Hg 1:4 "My people, why should you be living in well-built houses while my Temple lies in ruins? 
37Hg 1:5 Don't you see what is happening to you? 
37Hg 1:6 You have planted much grain, but have harvested very little. You have food to eat, but not enough to make you full. You have wine to drink, but not enough to get drunk on! You have clothing, but not enough to keep you warm. And workers cannot earn enough to live on. 
37Hg 1:7 Can't you see why this has happened? 
37Hg 1:8 Now go up into the hills, get lumber, and rebuild the Temple; then I will be pleased and will be worshiped as I should be. 
37Hg 1:9 "You hoped for large harvests, but they turned out to be small. And when you brought the harvest home, I blew it away. Why did I do that? Because my Temple lies in ruins while every one of you is busy working on your own house. 
37Hg 1:10 That is why there is no rain and nothing can grow. 
37Hg 1:11 I have brought drought on the land - on its hills, grainfields, vineyards, and olive orchards - on every crop the ground produces, on people and animals, on everything you try to grow." 
37Hg 1:12 Then Zerubbabel and Joshua and all the people who had returned from the exile in Babylonia, did what the LORD their God told them to do. They were afraid and obeyed the prophet Haggai, the LORD's messenger. 
37Hg 1:13 Then Haggai gave the LORD's message to the people�� "I will be with you - that is my promise." 
37Hg 1:14 The LORD inspired everyone to work on the Temple�� Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah; Joshua, the High Priest, and all the people who had returned from the exile. They began working on the Temple of the LORD Almighty, their God, 
37Hg 1:15 on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month of the second year that Darius was emperor. 
37Hg 2:1 On the twenty-first day of the seventh month of that same year, the LORD spoke again through the prophet Haggai. 
37Hg 2:2 He told Haggai to speak to Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, to Joshua, the High Priest, and to the people, and to say to them, 
37Hg 2:3 "Is there anyone among you who can still remember how splendid the Temple used to be? How does it look to you now? It must seem like nothing at all. 
37Hg 2:4 But now don't be discouraged, any of you. Do the work, for I am with you. 
37Hg 2:5 When you came out of Egypt, I promised that I would always be with you. I am still with you, so do not be afraid. 
37Hg 2:6 "Before long I will shake heaven and earth, land and sea. 
37Hg 2:7 I will overthrow all the nations, and their treasures will be brought here, and the Temple will be filled with wealth. 
37Hg 2:8 All the silver and gold of the world is mine. 
37Hg 2:9 The new Temple will be more splendid than the old one, and there I will give my people prosperity and peace." The LORD Almighty has spoken. 
37Hg 2:10 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of the second year that Darius was emperor, the LORD Almighty spoke again to the prophet Haggai. 
37Hg 2:11 He said, "Ask the priests for a ruling on this question�� 
37Hg 2:12 Suppose someone takes a piece of consecrated meat from a sacrifice and carries it in a fold of his robe. If he then lets his robe touch any bread, cooked food, wine, olive oil, or any kind of food at all, will it make that food consecrated also?" When the question was asked, the priests answered, "No." 
37Hg 2:13 Then Haggai asked, "Suppose someone is defiled because he has touched a dead body. If he then touches any of these foods, will that make them defiled too?" The priests answered, "Yes." 
37Hg 2:14 Then Haggai said, "The LORD says that the same thing applies to the people of this nation and to everything they produce; and so everything they offer on the altar is defiled." 
37Hg 2:15 The LORD says, "Can't you see what has happened to you? Before you started to rebuild the Temple, 
37Hg 2:16 you would go to a pile of grain expecting to find twenty bushels, but there would be only ten. You would go to draw fifty gallons of wine from a vat, but find only twenty. 
37Hg 2:17 I sent scorching winds and hail to ruin everything you tried to grow, but still you did not repent. 
37Hg 2:18 Today is the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, the day that the foundation of the Temple has been completed. See what is going to happen from now on. 
37Hg 2:19 Although there is no grain left, and the grapevines, fig trees, pomegranates, and olive trees have not yet produced, yet from now on I will bless you." 
37Hg 2:20 On that same day, the twenty-fourth of the month, the LORD gave Haggai a second message 
37Hg 2:21 for Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah�� "I am about to shake heaven and earth 
37Hg 2:22 and overthrow kingdoms and end their power. I will overturn chariots and their drivers; the horses will die, and their riders will kill one another. 
37Hg 2:23 On that day I will take you, Zerubbabel my servant, and I will appoint you to rule in my name. You are the one I have chosen." The LORD Almighty has spoken.

38Zch 1:1 In the eighth month of the second year that Darius was emperor of Persia, the LORD gave this message to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah and grandson of Iddo. 
38Zch 1:2 The LORD Almighty told Zechariah to say to the people, "I, the LORD, was very angry with your ancestors, 
38Zch 1:3 but now I say to you, 'Return to me, and I will return to you. 
38Zch 1:4 Do not be like your ancestors. Long ago the prophets gave them my message, telling them not to live evil, sinful lives any longer. But they would not listen to me or obey me. 
38Zch 1:5 Your ancestors and those prophets are no longer alive. 
38Zch 1:6 Through my servants the prophets I gave your ancestors commands and warnings, but they disregarded them and suffered the consequences. Then they repented and acknowledged that I, the LORD Almighty, had punished them as they deserved and as I had determined to do.' " 
38Zch 1:7 In the second year that Darius was emperor, on the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month (the month of Shebat), the LORD gave me a message in a vision at night. 
38Zch 1:8 I saw someone riding a red horse. He had stopped among some myrtle trees in a valley, and behind him were other horses - red, dappled, and white. 
38Zch 1:9 I asked him, "Sir, what do these horses mean?" He answered, "I will show you what they mean. 
38Zch 1:10 The LORD sent them to go and inspect the earth." 
38Zch 1:11 They reported to the angel�� "We have been all over the world and have found that the whole world lies helpless and subdued." 
38Zch 1:12 Then the angel said, "Almighty LORD, you have been angry with Jerusalem and the cities of Judah for seventy years now. How much longer will it be before you show them mercy?" 
38Zch 1:13 The LORD answered the angel with comforting words, 
38Zch 1:14 and the angel told me to proclaim what the LORD Almighty had said�� "I have a deep love and concern for Jerusalem, my holy city, 
38Zch 1:15 and I am very angry with the nations that enjoy quiet and peace. For while I was holding back my anger against my people, those nations made the sufferings of my people worse. 
38Zch 1:16 So I have come back to Jerusalem to show mercy to the city. My Temple will be restored, and the city will be rebuilt." 
38Zch 1:17 The angel also told me to proclaim�� "The LORD Almighty says that his cities will be prosperous again and that he will once again help Jerusalem and claim the city as his own." 
38Zch 1:18 In another vision I saw four ox horns. 
38Zch 1:19 I asked the angel that had been speaking to me, "What do these horns mean?" He answered, "They stand for the world powers that have scattered the people of Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem." 
38Zch 1:20 Then the LORD showed me four workers with hammers. 
38Zch 1:21 I asked, "What have they come to do?" He answered, "They have come to terrify and overthrow the nations that completely crushed the land of Judah and scattered its people." 
38Zch 2:1 In another vision I saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. 
38Zch 2:2 "Where are you going?" I asked. "To measure Jerusalem," he answered, "to see how long and how wide it is." 
38Zch 2:3 Then I saw the angel who had been speaking to me step forward, and another angel came to meet him. 
38Zch 2:4 The first one said to the other, "Run and tell that young man with the measuring line that there are going to be so many people and so much livestock in Jerusalem that it will be too big to have walls. 
38Zch 2:5 The LORD has promised that he himself will be a wall of fire around the city to protect it and that he will live there in all his glory." 
38Zch 2:6 The LORD said to his people, "I scattered you in all directions. 
38Zch 2:7 But now, you exiles, escape from Babylonia and return to Jerusalem. 
38Zch 2:8 Anyone who strikes you strikes what is most precious to me." So the LORD Almighty sent me with this message for the nations that had plundered his people�� 
38Zch 2:9 "The LORD himself will fight against you, and you will be plundered by the people who were once your servants." When this happens, everyone will know that the LORD Almighty sent me. 
38Zch 2:10 The LORD said, "Sing for joy, people of Jerusalem! I am coming to live among you!" 
38Zch 2:11 At that time many nations will come to the LORD and become his people. He will live among you, and you will know that he has sent me to you. 
38Zch 2:12 Once again Judah will be the special possession of the LORD in his sacred land, and Jerusalem will be the city he loves most of all. 
38Zch 2:13 Be silent, everyone, in the presence of the LORD, for he is coming from his holy dwelling place. 
38Zch 3:1 In another vision the LORD showed me the High Priest Joshua standing before the angel of the LORD. And there beside Joshua stood Satan, ready to bring an accusation against him. 
38Zch 3:2 The angel of the LORD said to Satan, "May the LORD condemn you, Satan! May the LORD, who loves Jerusalem, condemn you. This man is like a stick snatched from the fire." 
38Zch 3:3 Joshua was standing there, wearing filthy clothes. 
38Zch 3:4 The angel said to his heavenly attendants, "Take away the filthy clothes this man is wearing." Then he said to Joshua, "I have taken away your sin and will give you new clothes to wear." 
38Zch 3:5 He commanded the attendants to put a clean turban on Joshua's head. They did so, and then they put the new clothes on him while the angel of the LORD stood there. 
38Zch 3:6 Then the angel told Joshua that 
38Zch 3:7 the LORD Almighty had said�� "If you obey my laws and perform the duties I have assigned you, then you will continue to be in charge of my Temple and its courts, and I will hear your prayers, just as I hear the prayers of the angels who are in my presence. 
38Zch 3:8 Listen then, Joshua, you who are the High Priest; and listen, you fellow priests of his, you that are the sign of a good future�� I will reveal my servant, who is called The Branch! 
38Zch 3:9 I am placing in front of Joshua a single stone with seven facets. I will engrave an inscription on it, and in a single day I will take away the sin of this land. 
38Zch 3:10 When that day comes, each of you will invite your neighbor to come and enjoy peace and security, surrounded by your vineyards and fig trees." 
38Zch 4:1 The angel who had been speaking to me came again and roused me as if I had been sleeping. 
38Zch 4:2 "What do you see?" he asked. "A lampstand made of gold," I answered. "At the top is a bowl for the oil. On the lampstand are seven lamps, each one with places for seven wicks. 
38Zch 4:3 There are two olive trees beside the lampstand, one on each side of it." 
38Zch 4:4 Then I asked the angel, "What do these things stand for, sir?" 
38Zch 4:5 "Don't you know?" he asked me. "No, I don't, sir," I replied. 
38Zch 4:6 The angel told me to give Zerubbabel this message from the LORD�� "You will succeed, not by military might or by your own strength, but by my spirit. 
38Zch 4:7 Obstacles as great as mountains will disappear before you. You will rebuild the Temple, and as you put the last stone in place, the people will shout, 'Beautiful, beautiful!' " 
38Zch 4:8 Another message came to me from the LORD. 
38Zch 4:9 He said, "Zerubbabel has laid the foundation of the Temple, and he will finish the building. When this happens, my people will know that it is I who sent you to them. 
38Zch 4:10 They are disappointed because so little progress is being made. But they will see Zerubbabel continuing to build the Temple, and they will be glad." The angel said to me, "The seven lamps are the seven eyes of the LORD, which see all over the earth." 
38Zch 4:11 Then I asked him, "What do the two olive trees on either side of the lampstand mean? 
38Zch 4:12 And what is the meaning of the two olive branches beside the two gold pipes from which the olive oil pours?" 
38Zch 4:13 He asked me, "Don't you know?" "No, I don't, sir," I answered. 
38Zch 4:14 Then he said, "These are the two men whom God has chosen and anointed to serve him, the Lord of the whole earth." 
38Zch 5:1 I looked again, and this time I saw a scroll flying through the air. 
38Zch 5:2 The angel asked me what I saw. I answered, "A scroll flying through the air; it is thirty feet long and fifteen feet wide." 
38Zch 5:3 Then he said to me, "On it is written the curse that is to go out over the whole land. On one side of the scroll it says that every thief will be removed from the land; and on the other side it says that everyone who tells lies under oath will also be taken away. 
38Zch 5:4 The LORD Almighty says that he will send this curse out, and it will enter the house of every thief and the house of everyone who tells lies under oath. It will remain in their houses and leave them in ruins." 
38Zch 5:5 The angel appeared again and said, "Look! Something else is coming!" 
38Zch 5:6 "What is it?" I asked. He replied, "It is a basket, and it stands for the sin of the whole land." 
38Zch 5:7 The basket had a lid made of lead. As I watched, the lid was raised, and there in the basket sat a woman! 
38Zch 5:8 The angel said, "This represents wickedness." Then he pushed her down into the basket and put the lid back down. 
38Zch 5:9 I looked up and saw two women flying toward me with powerful wings like those of a stork. They picked up the basket and flew off with it. 
38Zch 5:10 I asked the angel, "Where are they taking it?" 
38Zch 5:11 He answered, "To Babylonia, where they will build a temple for it. When the temple is finished, the basket will be placed there to be worshiped." 
39
39Mal 1:1 This is the message that the LORD gave Malachi to tell the people of Israel. 
39Mal 1:2 The LORD says to his people, "I have always loved you." But they reply, "How have you shown your love for us?" The LORD answers, "Esau and Jacob were brothers, but I have loved Jacob and his descendants, 
39Mal 1:3 and have hated Esau and his descendants. I have devastated Esau's hill country and abandoned the land to jackals." 
39Mal 1:4 If Esau's descendants, the Edomites, say, "Our towns have been destroyed, but we will rebuild them," then the LORD will reply, "Let them rebuild - I will tear them down again. People will call them 'The evil country' and 'The nation with whom the LORD is angry forever.' " 
39Mal 1:5 The people of Israel are going to see this with their own eyes, and they will say, "The LORD is mighty even outside the land of Israel!" 
39Mal 1:6 The LORD Almighty says to the priests, "Children honor their parents, and servants honor their masters. I am your father - why don't you honor me? I am your master - why don't you respect me? You despise me, and yet you ask, 'How have we despised you?' 
39Mal 1:7 This is how - by offering worthless food on my altar. Then you ask, 'How have we failed to respect you?' I will tell you - by showing contempt for my altar. 
39Mal 1:8 When you bring a blind or sick or lame animal to sacrifice to me, do you think there's nothing wrong with that? Try giving an animal like that to the governor! Would he be pleased with you or grant you any favors?" 
39Mal 1:9 Now, you priests, try asking God to be good to us. He will not answer your prayer, and it will be your fault. 
39Mal 1:10 The LORD Almighty says, "I wish one of you would close the Temple doors so as to prevent you from lighting useless fires on my altar. I am not pleased with you; I will not accept the offerings you bring me. 
39Mal 1:11 People from one end of the world to the other honor me. Everywhere they burn incense to me and offer acceptable sacrifices. All of them honor me! 
39Mal 1:12 But you dishonor me when you say that my altar is worthless and when you offer on it food that you despise. 
39Mal 1:13 You say, 'How tired we are of all this!' and you turn up your nose at me. As your offering to me you bring a stolen animal or one that is lame or sick. Do you think I will accept that from you? 
39Mal 1:14 A curse on the cheater who sacrifices a worthless animal to me, when he has in his flock a good animal that he promised to give me! For I am a great king, and people of all nations fear me." 
39Mal 2:1 The LORD Almighty says to the priests, "This command is for you�� 
39Mal 2:2 You must honor me by what you do. If you will not listen to what I say, then I will bring a curse on you. I will put a curse on the things you receive for your support. In fact, I have already put a curse on them, because you do not take my command seriously. 
39Mal 2:3 I will punish your children and rub your faces in the dung of the animals you sacrifice - and you will be taken out to the dung heap. 
39Mal 2:4 Then you will know that I have given you this command, so that my covenant with the priests, the descendants of Levi, will not be broken. 
39Mal 2:5 "In my covenant I promised them life and well-being, and this is what I gave them, so that they might respect me. In those days they did respect and fear me. 
39Mal 2:6 They taught what was right, not what was wrong. They lived in harmony with me; they not only did what was right themselves, but they also helped many others to stop doing evil. 
39Mal 2:7 It is the duty of priests to teach the true knowledge of God. People should go to them to learn my will, because they are the messengers of the LORD Almighty. 
39Mal 2:8 "But now you priests have turned away from the right path. Your teaching has led many to do wrong. You have broken the covenant I made with you. 
39Mal 2:9 So I, in turn, will make the people of Israel despise you because you do not obey my will, and when you teach my people, you do not treat everyone alike." 
39Mal 2:10 Don't we all have the same father? Didn't the same God create us all? Then why do we break our promises to one another, and why do we despise the covenant that God made with our ancestors? 
39Mal 2:11 The people of Judah have broken their promise to God and done a horrible thing in Jerusalem and all over the country. They have defiled the Temple which the LORD loves. Men have married women who worship foreign gods. 
39Mal 2:12 May the LORD remove from the community of Israel those who did this, and never again let them participate in the offerings our nation brings to the LORD Almighty. 
39Mal 2:13 This is another thing you do. You drown the LORD's altar with tears, weeping and wailing because he no longer accepts the offerings you bring him. 
39Mal 2:14 You ask why he no longer accepts them. It is because he knows you have broken your promise to the wife you married when you were young. She was your partner, and you have broken your promise to her, although you promised before God that you would be faithful to her. 
39Mal 2:15 Didn't God make you one body and spirit with her? What was his purpose in this? It was that you should have children who are truly God's people. So make sure that none of you breaks his promise to his wife. 
39Mal 2:16 "I hate divorce," says the LORD God of Israel. "I hate it when one of you does such a cruel thing to his wife. Make sure that you do not break your promise to be faithful to your wife." 
39Mal 2:17 You have tired the LORD out with your talk. But you ask, "How have we tired him?" By saying, "The LORD Almighty thinks all evildoers are good; in fact he likes them." Or by asking, "Where is the God who is supposed to be just?" 
39Mal 3:1 The LORD Almighty answers, "I will send my messenger to prepare the way for me. Then the Lord you are looking for will suddenly come to his Temple. The messenger you long to see will come and proclaim my covenant." 
39Mal 3:2 But who will be able to endure the day when he comes? Who will be able to survive when he appears? He will be like strong soap, like a fire that refines metal. 
39Mal 3:3 He will come to judge like one who refines and purifies silver. As a metalworker refines silver and gold, so the LORD's messenger will purify the priests, so that they will bring to the LORD the right kind of offerings. 
39Mal 3:4 Then the offerings which the people of Judah and Jerusalem bring to the LORD will be pleasing to him, as they used to be in the past. 
39Mal 3:5 The LORD Almighty says, "I will appear among you to judge, and I will testify at once against those who practice magic, against adulterers, against those who give false testimony, those who cheat employees out of their wages, and those who take advantage of widows, orphans, and foreigners - against all who do not respect me. 
39Mal 3:6 "I am the LORD, and I do not change. And so you, the descendants of Jacob, are not yet completely lost. 
39Mal 3:7 You, like your ancestors before you, have turned away from my laws and have not kept them. Turn back to me, and I will turn to you. But you ask, 'What must we do to turn back to you?' 
39Mal 3:8 I ask you, is it right for a person to cheat God? Of course not, yet you are cheating me. 'How?' you ask. In the matter of tithes and offerings. 
39Mal 3:9 A curse is on all of you because the whole nation is cheating me. 
39Mal 3:10 Bring the full amount of your tithes to the Temple, so that there will be plenty of food there. Put me to the test and you will see that I will open the windows of heaven and pour out on you in abundance all kinds of good things. 
39Mal 3:11 I will not let insects destroy your crops, and your grapevines will be loaded with grapes. 
39Mal 3:12 Then the people of all nations will call you happy, because your land will be a good place to live. 
39Mal 3:13 "You have said terrible things about me," says the LORD. "But you ask, 'What have we said about you?' 
39Mal 3:14 You have said, 'It's useless to serve God. What's the use of doing what he says or of trying to show the LORD Almighty that we are sorry for what we have done? 
39Mal 3:15 As we see it, proud people are the ones who are happy. Evil people not only prosper, but they test God's patience with their evil deeds and get away with it.' " 
39Mal 3:16 Then the people who feared the LORD spoke to one another, and the LORD listened and heard what they said. In his presence, there was written down in a book a record of those who feared the LORD and respected him. 
39Mal 3:17 "They will be my people," says the LORD Almighty. "On the day when I act, they will be my very own. I will be merciful to them as parents are merciful to the children who serve them. 
39Mal 3:18 Once again my people will see the difference between what happens to the righteous and to the wicked, to the person who serves me and the one who does not." 
39Mal 4:1 The LORD Almighty says, "The day is coming when all proud and evil people will burn like straw. On that day they will burn up, and there will be nothing left of them. 
39Mal 4:2 But for you who obey me, my saving power will rise on you like the sun and bring healing like the sun's rays. You will be as free and happy as calves let out of a stall. 
39Mal 4:3 On the day when I act, you will overcome the wicked, and they will be like dust under your feet. 
39Mal 4:4 "Remember the teachings of my servant Moses, the laws and commands which I gave him at Mount Sinai for all the people of Israel to obey. 
39Mal 4:5 "But before the great and terrible day of the LORD comes, I will send you the prophet Elijah. 
39Mal 4:6 He will bring fathers and children together again; otherwise I would have to come and destroy your country."
