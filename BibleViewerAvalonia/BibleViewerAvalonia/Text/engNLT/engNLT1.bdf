01Gn 1:1 In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth��. / ��Or In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth, Or When God began to create the heavens and the earth.
01Gn 1:2 The earth was formless and empty, and darkness covered the deep waters. And the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters.
01Gn 1:3 Then God said, "Let there be light," and there was light.
01Gn 1:4 And God saw that the light was good. Then he separated the light from the darkness.
01Gn 1:5 God called the light "day" and the darkness "night."  And evening passed and morning came, marking the first day.
01Gn 1:6 Then God said, "Let there be a space between the waters, to separate the waters of the heavens from the waters of the earth."
01Gn 1:7 And that is what happened. God made this space to separate the waters of the earth from the waters of the heavens.
01Gn 1:8 God called the space "sky." And evening passed and morning came, marking the second day.
01Gn 1:9 Then God said, "Let the waters beneath the sky flow together into one place, so dry ground may appear." And that is what happened.
01Gn 1:10 God called the dry ground "land" and the waters "seas." And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:11 Then God said, "Let the land sprout with vegetation - every sort of seed-bearing plant, and trees that grow seed-bearing fruit. These seeds will then produce the kinds of plants and trees from which they came." And that is what happened.
01Gn 1:12 The land produced vegetation - all sorts of seed-bearing plants, and trees with seed-bearing fruit. Their seeds produced plants and trees of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:13 And evening passed and morning came, marking the third day.
01Gn 1:14 Then God said, "Let lights appear in the sky to separate the day from the night. Let them be signs to mark the seasons, days, and years.
01Gn 1:15 Let these lights in the sky shine down on the earth." And that is what happened.
01Gn 1:16 God made two great lights;the larger one to govern the day, and the smaller one to govern the night. He also made the stars.
01Gn 1:17 God set these lights in the sky to light the earth,
01Gn 1:18 to govern the day and night, and to separate the light from the darkness. And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:19 And evening passed and morning came, marking the fourth day.
01Gn 1:20 Then God said, "Let the waters swarm with fish and other life. Let the skies be filled with birds of every kind."
01Gn 1:21 So God created great sea creatures and every living thing that scurries and swarms in the water, and every sort of bird - each producing offspring of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:22 Then God blessed them, saying, "Be fruitful and multiply. Let the fish fill the seas, and let the birds multiply on the earth."
01Gn 1:23 And evening passed and morning came, marking the fifth day.
01Gn 1:24 Then God said, "Let the earth produce every sort of animal, each producing offspring of the same kind - livestock, small animals that scurry along the ground, and wild animals." And that is what happened.
01Gn 1:25 God made all sorts of wild animals, livestock, and small animals, each able to produce offspring of the same kind. And God saw that it was good.
01Gn 1:26 Then God said, "Let us make human beings�� in our image, to be like us. They will reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the livestock, all the wild animals on the earth, and the small animals that scurry along the ground." / ��Or man; Hebrew reads adam
01Gn 1:27 So God created human beings�� / ��Or the man; Hebrew reads ha-adam in his own image. In the image of God he created them; male and female he created them.
01Gn 1:28 Then God blessed them and said, "Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth and govern it. Reign over the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, and all the animals that scurry along the ground."
01Gn 1:29 Then God said, "Look! I have given you every seed-bearing plant throughout the earth and all the fruit trees for your food.
01Gn 1:30 And I have given every green plant as food for all the wild animals, the birds in the sky, and the small animals that scurry along the ground - everything that has life." And that is what happened.
01Gn 1:31 Then God looked over all he had made, and he saw that it was very good!  And evening passed and morning came, marking the sixth day.
01Gn 2:1 So the creation of the heavens and the earth and everything in them was completed.
01Gn 2:2 On the seventh day God had finished his work of creation, so he rested�� from all his work. / ��Or ceased; also in 2.3
01Gn 2:3 And God blessed the seventh day and declared it holy, because it was the day when he rested from all his work of creation.
01Gn 2:4 This is the account of the creation of the heavens and the earth. When the LORD God made the earth and the heavens,
01Gn 2:5 neither wild plants nor grains were growing on the earth. For the LORD God had not yet sent rain to water the earth, and there were no people to cultivate the soil.
01Gn 2:6 Instead, springs�� came up from the ground and watered all the land. / ��Or mist
01Gn 2:7 Then the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground. He breathed the breath of life into the man's nostrils, and the man became a living person.
01Gn 2:8 Then the LORD God planted a garden in Eden in the east, and there he placed the man he had made.
01Gn 2:9 The LORD God made all sorts of trees grow up from the ground - trees that were beautiful and that produced delicious fruit. In the middle of the garden he placed the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.
01Gn 2:10 A river flowed from the land of Eden, watering the garden and then dividing into four branches.
01Gn 2:11 The first branch, called the Pishon, flowed around the entire land of Havilah, where gold is found.
01Gn 2:12 The gold of that land is exceptionally pure; aromatic resin and onyx stone are also found there.
01Gn 2:13 The second branch, called the Gihon, flowed around the entire land of Cush.
01Gn 2:14 The third branch, called the Tigris, flowed east of the land of Asshur. The fourth branch is called the Euphrates.
01Gn 2:15 The LORD God placed the man in the Garden of Eden to tend and watch over it.
01Gn 2:16 But the LORD God warned him, "You may freely eat the fruit of every tree in the garden
01Gn 2:17  - except the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. If you eat its fruit, you are sure to die."
01Gn 2:18 Then the LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make a helper who is just right for him."
01Gn 2:19 So the LORD God formed from the ground all the wild animals and all the birds of the sky. He brought them to the man�� to see what he would call them, and the man chose a name for each one. / ��Or Adam, and so throughout the chapter
01Gn 2:20 He gave names to all the livestock, all the birds of the sky, and all the wild animals. But still there was no helper just right for him.
01Gn 2:21 So the LORD God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep. While the man slept, the LORD God took out one of the man's ribs�� and closed up the opening. / ��Or took a part of the man's side
01Gn 2:22 Then the LORD God made a woman from the rib, and he brought her to the man.
01Gn 2:23 "At last!" the man exclaimed. "This one is bone from my bone, and flesh from my flesh! She will be called 'woman,'  because she was taken from 'man.'"
01Gn 2:24 This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.
01Gn 2:25 Now the man and his wife were both naked, but they felt no shame.
01Gn 3:1 The serpent was the shrewdest of all the wild animals the LORD God had made. One day he asked the woman, "Did God really say you must not eat the fruit from any of the trees in the garden?"
01Gn 3:2 "Of course we may eat fruit from the trees in the garden," the woman replied.
01Gn 3:3 "It's only the fruit from the tree in the middle of the garden that we are not allowed to eat. God said, 'You must not eat it or even touch it; if you do, you will die.'"
01Gn 3:4 "You won't die!" the serpent replied to the woman.
01Gn 3:5 "God knows that your eyes will be opened as soon as you eat it, and you will be like God, knowing both good and evil."
01Gn 3:6 The woman was convinced. She saw that the tree was beautiful and its fruit looked delicious, and she wanted the wisdom it would give her. So she took some of the fruit and ate it. Then she gave some to her husband, who was with her, and he ate it, too.
01Gn 3:7 At that moment their eyes were opened, and they suddenly felt shame at their nakedness. So they sewed fig leaves together to cover themselves.
01Gn 3:8 When the cool evening breezes were blowing, the man�� and his wife heard the LORD God walking about in the garden. So they hid from the LORD God among the trees. / ��Or Adam, and so throughout the chapter
01Gn 3:9 Then the LORD God called to the man, "Where are you?"
01Gn 3:10 He replied, "I heard you walking in the garden, so I hid. I was afraid because I was naked."
01Gn 3:11 "Who told you that you were naked?" the LORD God asked. "Have you eaten from the tree whose fruit I commanded you not to eat?"
01Gn 3:12 The man replied, "It was the woman you gave me who gave me the fruit, and I ate it."
01Gn 3:13 Then the LORD God asked the woman, "What have you done?" "The serpent deceived me," she replied. "That's why I ate it."
01Gn 3:14 Then the LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, you are cursed more than all animals, domestic and wild. You will crawl on your belly, groveling in the dust as long as you live.
01Gn 3:15 And I will cause hostility between you and the woman, and between your offspring and her offspring. He will strike�� your head, and you will strike his heel." / ��Or bruise; also in 3.15b
01Gn 3:16 Then he said to the woman, "I will sharpen the pain of your pregnancy, and in pain you will give birth. And you will desire to control your husband, but he will rule over you��." / ��Or And though you will have desire for your husband, he will rule over you.
01Gn 3:17 And to the man he said, "Since you listened to your wife and ate from the tree whose fruit I commanded you not to eat, the ground is cursed because of you. All your life you will struggle to scratch a living from it.
01Gn 3:18 It will grow thorns and thistles for you, though you will eat of its grains.
01Gn 3:19 By the sweat of your brow will you have food to eat until you return to the ground from which you were made. For you were made from dust, and to dust you will return."
01Gn 3:20 Then the man - Adam - named his wife Eve, because she would be the mother of all who live��. / ��Eve sounds like a Hebrew term that means "to give life"
01Gn 3:21 And the LORD God made clothing from animal skins for Adam and his wife.
01Gn 3:22 Then the LORD God said, "Look, the human beings�� have become like us, knowing both good and evil. What if they reach out, take fruit from the tree of life, and eat it? Then they will live forever!" / ��Or the man; Hebrew reads ha-adam
01Gn 3:23 So the LORD God banished them from the Garden of Eden, and he sent Adam out to cultivate the ground from which he had been made.
01Gn 3:24 After sending them out, the LORD God stationed mighty cherubim to the east of the Garden of Eden. And he placed a flaming sword that flashed back and forth to guard the way to the tree of life.
01Gn 4:1 Now Adam�� had sexual relations with his wife, Eve, and she became pregnant. When she gave birth to Cain, she said, "With the LORD's help, I have produced�� a man!" / ��Or the man; also in 4.25 ��Or I have acquired. Cain sounds like a Hebrew term that can mean "produce" or "acquire"
01Gn 4:2 Later she gave birth to his brother and named him Abel. When they grew up, Abel became a shepherd, while Cain cultivated the ground.
01Gn 4:3 When it was time for the harvest, Cain presented some of his crops as a gift to the LORD.
01Gn 4:4 Abel also brought a gift - the best of the firstborn lambs from his flock. The LORD accepted Abel and his gift,
01Gn 4:5 but he did not accept Cain and his gift. This made Cain very angry, and he looked dejected.
01Gn 4:6 "Why are you so angry?" the LORD asked Cain. "Why do you look so dejected?
01Gn 4:7 You will be accepted if you do what is right. But if you refuse to do what is right, then watch out! Sin is crouching at the door, eager to control you. But you must subdue it and be its master."
01Gn 4:8 One day Cain suggested to his brother, "Let's go out into the fields."�� And while they were in the field, Cain attacked his brother, Abel, and killed him. / ��As in Samaritan Pentateuch, Greek and Syriac versions, and Latin Vulgate; Masoretic Text lacks "Let's go out into the fields."
01Gn 4:9 Afterward the LORD asked Cain, "Where is your brother? Where is Abel?" "I don't know," Cain responded. "Am I my brother's guardian?"
01Gn 4:10 But the LORD said, "What have you done? Listen! Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground!
01Gn 4:11 Now you are cursed and banished from the ground, which has swallowed your brother's blood.
01Gn 4:12 No longer will the ground yield good crops for you, no matter how hard you work! From now on you will be a homeless wanderer on the earth."
01Gn 4:13 Cain replied to the LORD, "My punishment�� is too great for me to bear! / ��Or My sin
01Gn 4:14 You have banished me from the land and from your presence; you have made me a homeless wanderer. Anyone who finds me will kill me!"
01Gn 4:15 The LORD replied, "No, for I will give a sevenfold punishment to anyone who kills you." Then the LORD put a mark on Cain to warn anyone who might try to kill him.
01Gn 4:16 So Cain left the LORD's presence and settled in the land of Nod��, east of Eden. / ��Nod means "wandering"
01Gn 4:17 Cain had sexual relations with his wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Then Cain founded a city, which he named Enoch, after his son.
01Gn 4:18 Enoch had a son named Irad. Irad became the father of�� Mehujael. Mehujael became the father of Methushael. Methushael became the father of Lamech. / ��Or the ancestor of, and so throughout the verse
01Gn 4:19 Lamech married two women. The first was named Adah, and the second was Zillah.
01Gn 4:20 Adah gave birth to Jabal, who was the first of those who raise livestock and live in tents.
01Gn 4:21 His brother's name was Jubal, the first of all who play the harp and flute.
01Gn 4:22 Lamech's other wife, Zillah, gave birth to a son named Tubal-cain. He became an expert in forging tools of bronze and iron. Tubal-cain had a sister named Naamah.
01Gn 4:23 One day Lamech said to his wives, "Adah and Zillah, hear my voice; listen to me, you wives of Lamech. I have killed a man who attacked me, a young man who wounded me.
01Gn 4:24 If someone who kills Cain is punished seven times, then the one who kills me will be punished seventy-seven times!"
01Gn 4:25 Adam had sexual relations with his wife again, and she gave birth to another son. She named him Seth��, for she said, "God has granted me another son in place of Abel, whom Cain killed." / ��Seth probably means "granted"; the name may also mean "appointed"
01Gn 4:26 When Seth grew up, he had a son and named him Enosh. At that time people first began to worship the LORD by name.
01Gn 5:1 This is the written account of the descendants of Adam. When God created human beings��, he made them to be like himself.
01Gn 5:2 He created them male and female, and he blessed them and called them "human." / ��Or man; Hebrew reads adam; similarly in 5.2
01Gn 5:3 When Adam was 130 years old, he became the father of a son who was just like him - in his very image. He named his son Seth.
01Gn 5:4 After the birth of Seth, Adam lived another 800 years, and he had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:5 Adam lived 930 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:6 When Seth was 105 years old, he became the father of�� Enosh. / ��Or the ancestor of; also in 5.9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 25
01Gn 5:7 After the birth of�� Enosh, Seth lived another 807 years, and he had other sons and daughters. / ��Or the birth of this ancestor of; also in 5.10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 26
01Gn 5:8 Seth lived 912 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:9 When Enosh was 90 years old, he became the father of Kenan.
01Gn 5:10 After the birth of Kenan, Enosh lived another 815 years, and he had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:11 Enosh lived 905 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:12 When Kenan was 70 years old, he became the father of Mahalalel.
01Gn 5:13 After the birth of Mahalalel, Kenan lived another 840 years, and he had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:14 Kenan lived 910 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:15 When Mahalalel was 65 years old, he became the father of Jared.
01Gn 5:16 After the birth of Jared, Mahalalel lived another 830 years, and he had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:17 Mahalalel lived 895 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:18 When Jared was 162 years old, he became the father of Enoch.
01Gn 5:19 After the birth of Enoch, Jared lived another 800 years, and he had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:20 Jared lived 962 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:21 When Enoch was 65 years old, he became the father of Methuselah.
01Gn 5:22 After the birth of Methuselah, Enoch lived in close fellowship with God for another 300 years, and he had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:23 Enoch lived 365 years,
01Gn 5:24 walking in close fellowship with God. Then one day he disappeared, because God took him.
01Gn 5:25 When Methuselah was 187 years old, he became the father of Lamech.
01Gn 5:26 After the birth of Lamech, Methuselah lived another 782 years, and he had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:27 Methuselah lived 969 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:28 When Lamech was 182 years old, he became the father of a son.
01Gn 5:29 Lamech named his son Noah, for he said, "May he bring us relief�� from our work and the painful labor of farming this ground that the LORD has cursed." / ��Noah sounds like a Hebrew term that can mean "relief" or "comfort"
01Gn 5:30 After the birth of Noah, Lamech lived another 595 years, and he had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 5:31 Lamech lived 777 years, and then he died.
01Gn 5:32 By the time Noah was 500 years old, he was the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
01Gn 6:1 Then the people began to multiply on the earth, and daughters were born to them.
01Gn 6:2 The sons of God saw the beautiful women�� and took any they wanted as their wives. / ��Hebrew daughters of men; also in 6.4
01Gn 6:3 Then the LORD said, "My Spirit will not put up with�� humans for such a long time, for they are only mortal flesh. In the future, their normal lifespan will be no more than 120 years." / ��Greek version reads will not remain in
01Gn 6:4 In those days, and for some time after, giant Nephilites lived on the earth, for whenever the sons of God had intercourse with women, they gave birth to children who became the heroes and famous warriors of ancient times.
01Gn 6:5 The LORD observed the extent of human wickedness on the earth, and he saw that everything they thought or imagined was consistently and totally evil.
01Gn 6:6 So the LORD was sorry he had ever made them and put them on the earth. It broke his heart.
01Gn 6:7 And the LORD said, "I will wipe this human race I have created from the face of the earth. Yes, and I will destroy every living thing - all the people, the large animals, the small animals that scurry along the ground, and even the birds of the sky. I am sorry I ever made them."
01Gn 6:8 But Noah found favor with the LORD.
01Gn 6:9 This is the account of Noah and his family. Noah was a righteous man, the only blameless person living on earth at the time, and he walked in close fellowship with God.
01Gn 6:10 Noah was the father of three sons�� Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
01Gn 6:11 Now God saw that the earth had become corrupt and was filled with violence.
01Gn 6:12 God observed all this corruption in the world, for everyone on earth was corrupt.
01Gn 6:13 So God said to Noah, "I have decided to destroy all living creatures, for they have filled the earth with violence. Yes, I will wipe them all out along with the earth!
01Gn 6:14 "Build a large boat�� from cypress wood�� and waterproof it with tar, inside and out. Then construct decks and stalls throughout its interior. / ��Traditionally rendered an ark �� / ��Or gopher wood
01Gn 6:15 Make the boat 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high��. / ��Hebrew 300 cubits [138 meters] long, 50 cubits [23 meters] wide, and 30 cubits [13.8 meters] high
01Gn 6:16 Leave an 18-inch opening�� below the roof all the way around the boat. Put the door on the side, and build three decks inside the boat - lower, middle, and upper. / ��Hebrew an opening of 1 cubit [46 centimeters]
01Gn 6:17 "Look! I am about to cover the earth with a flood that will destroy every living thing that breathes. Everything on earth will die.
01Gn 6:18 But I will confirm my covenant with you. So enter the boat - you and your wife and your sons and their wives.
01Gn 6:19 Bring a pair of every kind of animal - a male and a female - into the boat with you to keep them alive during the flood.
01Gn 6:20 Pairs of every kind of bird, and every kind of animal, and every kind of small animal that scurries along the ground, will come to you to be kept alive.
01Gn 6:21 And be sure to take on board enough food for your family and for all the animals."
01Gn 6:22 So Noah did everything exactly as God had commanded him.
01Gn 7:1 When everything was ready, the LORD said to Noah, "Go into the boat with all your family, for among all the people of the earth, I can see that you alone are righteous.
01Gn 7:2 Take with you seven pairs - male and female - of each animal I have approved for eating and for sacrifice��, and take one pair of each of the others. / ��Hebrew of each clean animal; similarly in 7.8
01Gn 7:3 Also take seven pairs of every kind of bird. There must be a male and a female in each pair to ensure that all life will survive on the earth after the flood.
01Gn 7:4 Seven days from now I will make the rains pour down on the earth. And it will rain for forty days and forty nights, until I have wiped from the earth all the living things I have created."
01Gn 7:5 So Noah did everything as the LORD commanded him.
01Gn 7:6 Noah was 600 years old when the flood covered the earth.
01Gn 7:7 He went on board the boat to escape the flood - he and his wife and his sons and their wives.
01Gn 7:8 With them were all the various kinds of animals - those approved for eating and for sacrifice and those that were not - along with all the birds and the small animals that scurry along the ground.
01Gn 7:9 They entered the boat in pairs, male and female, just as God had commanded Noah.
01Gn 7:10 After seven days, the waters of the flood came and covered the earth.
01Gn 7:11 When Noah was 600 years old, on the seventeenth day of the second month, all the underground waters erupted from the earth, and the rain fell in mighty torrents from the sky.
01Gn 7:12 The rain continued to fall for forty days and forty nights.
01Gn 7:13 That very day Noah had gone into the boat with his wife and his sons - Shem, Ham, and Japheth - and their wives.
01Gn 7:14 With them in the boat were pairs of every kind of animal - domestic and wild, large and small - along with birds of every kind.
01Gn 7:15 Two by two they came into the boat, representing every living thing that breathes.
01Gn 7:16 A male and female of each kind entered, just as God had commanded Noah. Then the LORD closed the door behind them.
01Gn 7:17 For forty days the floodwaters grew deeper, covering the ground and lifting the boat high above the earth.
01Gn 7:18 As the waters rose higher and higher above the ground, the boat floated safely on the surface.
01Gn 7:19 Finally, the water covered even the highest mountains on the earth,
01Gn 7:20 rising more than twenty-two feet�� above the highest peaks. / ��Hebrew 15 cubits [6.9 meters]
01Gn 7:21 All the living things on earth died - birds, domestic animals, wild animals, small animals that scurry along the ground, and all the people.
01Gn 7:22 Everything that breathed and lived on dry land died.
01Gn 7:23 God wiped out every living thing on the earth - people, livestock, small animals that scurry along the ground, and the birds of the sky. All were destroyed. The only people who survived were Noah and those with him in the boat.
01Gn 7:24 And the floodwaters covered the earth for 150 days.
01Gn 8:1 But God remembered Noah and all the wild animals and livestock with him in the boat. He sent a wind to blow across the earth, and the floodwaters began to recede.
01Gn 8:2 The underground waters stopped flowing, and the torrential rains from the sky were stopped.
01Gn 8:3 So the floodwaters gradually receded from the earth. After 150 days,
01Gn 8:4 exactly five months from the time the flood began��, the boat came to rest on the mountains of Ararat. / ��Hebrew on the seventeenth day of the seventh month; see 7.11
01Gn 8:5 Two and a half months later��, as the waters continued to go down, other mountain peaks became visible. / ��Hebrew On the first day of the tenth month; see 7.11 and note on 8.4
01Gn 8:6 After another forty days, Noah opened the window he had made in the boat
01Gn 8:7 and released a raven. The bird flew back and forth until the floodwaters on the earth had dried up.
01Gn 8:8 He also released a dove to see if the water had receded and it could find dry ground.
01Gn 8:9 But the dove could find no place to land because the water still covered the ground. So it returned to the boat, and Noah held out his hand and drew the dove back inside.
01Gn 8:10 After waiting another seven days, Noah released the dove again.
01Gn 8:11 This time the dove returned to him in the evening with a fresh olive leaf in its beak. Then Noah knew that the floodwaters were almost gone.
01Gn 8:12 He waited another seven days and then released the dove again. This time it did not come back.
01Gn 8:13 Noah was now 601 years old. On the first day of the new year, ten and a half months after the flood began��, the floodwaters had almost dried up from the earth. Noah lifted back the covering of the boat and saw that the surface of the ground was drying. / ��Hebrew On the first day of the first month; see 7.11
01Gn 8:14 Two more months went by��, and at last the earth was dry! / ��Hebrew The twenty-seventh day of the second month arrived; see note on 8.13
01Gn 8:15 Then God said to Noah,
01Gn 8:16 "Leave the boat, all of you - you and your wife, and your sons and their wives.
01Gn 8:17 Release all the animals - the birds, the livestock, and the small animals that scurry along the ground - so they can be fruitful and multiply throughout the earth."
01Gn 8:18 So Noah, his wife, and his sons and their wives left the boat.
01Gn 8:19 And all of the large and small animals and birds came out of the boat, pair by pair.
01Gn 8:20 Then Noah built an altar to the LORD, and there he sacrificed as burnt offerings the animals and birds that had been approved for that purpose��. / ��Hebrew every clean animal and every clean bird
01Gn 8:21 And the LORD was pleased with the aroma of the sacrifice and said to himself, "I will never again curse the ground because of the human race, even though everything they think or imagine is bent toward evil from childhood. I will never again destroy all living things.
01Gn 8:22 As long as the earth remains, there will be planting and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, day and night."
01Gn 9:1 Then God blessed Noah and his sons and told them, "Be fruitful and multiply. Fill the earth.
01Gn 9:2 All the animals of the earth, all the birds of the sky, all the small animals that scurry along the ground, and all the fish in the sea will look on you with fear and terror. I have placed them in your power.
01Gn 9:3 I have given them to you for food, just as I have given you grain and vegetables.
01Gn 9:4 But you must never eat any meat that still has the lifeblood in it.
01Gn 9:5 "And I will require the blood of anyone who takes another person's life. If a wild animal kills a person, it must die. And anyone who murders a fellow human must die.
01Gn 9:6 If anyone takes a human life, that person's life will also be taken by human hands. For God made human beings�� in his own image. / ��Or man; Hebrew reads ha-adam
01Gn 9:7 Now be fruitful and multiply, and repopulate the earth."
01Gn 9:8 Then God told Noah and his sons,
01Gn 9:9 "I hereby confirm my covenant with you and your descendants,
01Gn 9:10 and with all the animals that were on the boat with you - the birds, the livestock, and all the wild animals - every living creature on earth.
01Gn 9:11 Yes, I am confirming my covenant with you. Never again will floodwaters kill all living creatures; never again will a flood destroy the earth."
01Gn 9:12 Then God said, "I am giving you a sign of my covenant with you and with all living creatures, for all generations to come.
01Gn 9:13 I have placed my rainbow in the clouds. It is the sign of my covenant with you and with all the earth.
01Gn 9:14 When I send clouds over the earth, the rainbow will appear in the clouds,
01Gn 9:15 and I will remember my covenant with you and with all living creatures. Never again will the floodwaters destroy all life.
01Gn 9:16 When I see the rainbow in the clouds, I will remember the eternal covenant between God and every living creature on earth."
01Gn 9:17 Then God said to Noah, "Yes, this rainbow is the sign of the covenant I am confirming with all the creatures on earth."
01Gn 9:18 The sons of Noah who came out of the boat with their father were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham is the father of Canaan.)
01Gn 9:19 From these three sons of Noah came all the people who now populate the earth.
01Gn 9:20 After the flood, Noah began to cultivate the ground, and he planted a vineyard.
01Gn 9:21 One day he drank some wine he had made, and he became drunk and lay naked inside his tent.
01Gn 9:22 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw that his father was naked and went outside and told his brothers.
01Gn 9:23 Then Shem and Japheth took a robe, held it over their shoulders, and backed into the tent to cover their father. As they did this, they looked the other way so they would not see him naked.
01Gn 9:24 When Noah woke up from his stupor, he learned what Ham, his youngest son, had done.
01Gn 9:25 Then he cursed Canaan, the son of Ham�� "May Canaan be cursed!  May he be the lowest of servants to his relatives."
01Gn 9:26 Then Noah said, "May the LORD, the God of Shem, be blessed, and may Canaan be his servant!
01Gn 9:27 May God expand the territory of Japheth! May Japheth share the prosperity of Shem��, and may Canaan be his servant." / ��Hebrew May he live in the tents of Shem
01Gn 9:28 Noah lived another 350 years after the great flood.
01Gn 9:29 He lived 950 years, and then he died.
01Gn 10:1 This is the account of the families of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the three sons of Noah. Many children were born to them after the great flood.
01Gn 10:2 The descendants of Japheth were Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
01Gn 10:3 The descendants of Gomer were Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
01Gn 10:4 The descendants of Javan were Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Rodanim��. / ��As in some Hebrew manuscripts and Greek version (see also 1 Chr 1.7); most Hebrew manuscripts read Dodanim
01Gn 10:5 Their descendants became the seafaring peoples that spread out to various lands, each identified by its own language, clan, and national identity.
01Gn 10:6 The descendants of Ham were Cush, Mizraim, Put, and Canaan.
01Gn 10:7 The descendants of Cush were Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. The descendants of Raamah were Sheba and Dedan.
01Gn 10:8 Cush was also the ancestor of Nimrod, who was the first heroic warrior on earth.
01Gn 10:9 Since he was the greatest hunter in the world��, his name became proverbial. People would say, "This man is like Nimrod, the greatest hunter in the world." / ��Hebrew a great hunter before the LORD; also in 10.9b
01Gn 10:10 He built his kingdom in the land of Babylonia��, with the cities of Babylon, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh. / ��Hebrew Shinar
01Gn 10:11 From there he expanded his territory to Assyria��, building the cities of Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah, / ��Or From that land Assyria went out
01Gn 10:12 and Resen (the great city located between Nineveh and Calah).
01Gn 10:13 Mizraim was the ancestor of the Ludites, Anamites, Lehabites, Naphtuhites,
01Gn 10:14 Pathrusites, Casluhites, and the Caphtorites, from whom the Philistines came��. / ��Hebrew Casluhites, from whom the Philistines came, and Caphtorites. Compare Jer 47.4; Amos 9.7
01Gn 10:15 Canaan's oldest son was Sidon, the ancestor of the Sidonians. Canaan was also the ancestor of the Hittites��, / ��Hebrew ancestor of Heth
01Gn 10:16 Jebusites, Amorites, Girgashites,
01Gn 10:17 Hivites, Arkites, Sinites,
01Gn 10:18 Arvadites, Zemarites, and Hamathites. The Canaanite clans eventually spread out,
01Gn 10:19 and the territory of Canaan extended from Sidon in the north to Gerar and Gaza in the south, and east as far as Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, near Lasha.
01Gn 10:20 These were the descendants of Ham, identified by clan, language, territory, and national identity.
01Gn 10:21 Sons were also born to Shem, the older brother of Japheth��. Shem was the ancestor of all the descendants of Eber. / ��Or Shem, whose older brother was Japheth
01Gn 10:22 The descendants of Shem were Elam, Asshur, Arphaxad, Lud, and Aram.
01Gn 10:23 The descendants of Aram were Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
01Gn 10:24 Arphaxad was the father of Shelah��, and Shelah was the father of Eber. / ��Greek version reads Arphaxad was the father of Cainan, Cainan was the father of Shelah. Compare Luke 3.36
01Gn 10:25 Eber had two sons. The first was named Peleg (which means "division"), for during his lifetime the people of the world were divided into different language groups. His brother's name was Joktan.
01Gn 10:26 Joktan was the ancestor of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah,
01Gn 10:27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah,
01Gn 10:28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba,
01Gn 10:29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were descendants of Joktan.
01Gn 10:30 The territory they occupied extended from Mesha all the way to Sephar in the eastern mountains.
01Gn 10:31 These were the descendants of Shem, identified by clan, language, territory, and national identity.
01Gn 10:32 These are the clans that descended from Noah's sons, arranged by nation according to their lines of descent. All the nations of the earth descended from these clans after the great flood.
01Gn 11:1 At one time all the people of the world spoke the same language and used the same words.
01Gn 11:2 As the people migrated to the east, they found a plain in the land of Babylonia�� and settled there. / ��Hebrew Shinar
01Gn 11:3 They began saying to each other, "Let's make bricks and harden them with fire." (In this region bricks were used instead of stone, and tar was used for mortar.)
01Gn 11:4 Then they said, "Come, let's build a great city for ourselves with a tower that reaches into the sky. This will make us famous and keep us from being scattered all over the world."
01Gn 11:5 But the LORD came down to look at the city and the tower the people were building.
01Gn 11:6 "Look!" he said. "The people are united, and they all speak the same language. After this, nothing they set out to do will be impossible for them!
01Gn 11:7 Come, let's go down and confuse the people with different languages. Then they won't be able to understand each other."
01Gn 11:8 In that way, the LORD scattered them all over the world, and they stopped building the city.
01Gn 11:9 That is why the city was called Babel��, because that is where the LORD confused the people with different languages. In this way he scattered them all over the world. / ��Or Babylon. Babel sounds like a Hebrew term that means "confusion"
01Gn 11:10 This is the account of Shem's family. Two years after the great flood, when Shem was 100 years old, he became the father of�� Arphaxad. / ��Or the ancestor of; also in 11.12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24
01Gn 11:11 After the birth of�� Arphaxad, Shem lived another 500 years and had other sons and daughters. / ��Or the birth of this ancestor of; also in 11.13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25
01Gn 11:12 When Arphaxad was 35 years old, he became the father of Shelah.�� / ��Greek version reads "When Arphaxad was 135 years old, he became the father of Cainan."
01Gn 11:13 After the birth of Shelah, Arphaxad lived another 403 years and had other sons and daughters��. / ��Greek version reads "After the birth of Cainan, Arphaxad lived another 430 years and had other sons and daughters, and then he died. When Cainan was 130 years old, he became the father of Shelah. After the birth of Shelah, Cainan lived another 330 years and had other sons and daughters, and then he died." Compare Luke 3.35-36
01Gn 11:14 When Shelah was 30 years old, he became the father of Eber.
01Gn 11:15 After the birth of Eber, Shelah lived another 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:16 When Eber was 34 years old, he became the father of Peleg.
01Gn 11:17 After the birth of Peleg, Eber lived another 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:18 When Peleg was 30 years old, he became the father of Reu.
01Gn 11:19 After the birth of Reu, Peleg lived another 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:20 When Reu was 32 years old, he became the father of Serug.
01Gn 11:21 After the birth of Serug, Reu lived another 207 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:22 When Serug was 30 years old, he became the father of Nahor.
01Gn 11:23 After the birth of Nahor, Serug lived another 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:24 When Nahor was 29 years old, he became the father of Terah.
01Gn 11:25 After the birth of Terah, Nahor lived another 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:26 After Terah was 70 years old, he became the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
01Gn 11:27 This is the account of Terah's family. Terah was the father of Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot.
01Gn 11:28 But Haran died in Ur of the Chaldeans, the land of his birth, while his father, Terah, was still living.
01Gn 11:29 Meanwhile, Abram and Nahor both married. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah. (Milcah and her sister Iscah were daughters of Nahor's brother Haran.)
01Gn 11:30 But Sarai was unable to become pregnant and had no children.
01Gn 11:31 One day Terah took his son Abram, his daughter-in-law Sarai (his son Abram's wife), and his grandson Lot (his son Haran's child) and moved away from Ur of the Chaldeans. He was headed for the land of Canaan, but they stopped at Haran and settled there.
01Gn 11:32 Terah lived for 205 years�� and died while still in Haran. / ��Some ancient versions read 145 years; compare 11.26 and 12.4
01Gn 12:1 The LORD had said to Abram, "Leave your native country, your relatives, and your father's family, and go to the land that I will show you.
01Gn 12:2 I will make you into a great nation. I will bless you and make you famous, and you will be a blessing to others.
01Gn 12:3 I will bless those who bless you and curse those who treat you with contempt. All the families on earth will be blessed through you."
01Gn 12:4 So Abram departed as the LORD had instructed, and Lot went with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran.
01Gn 12:5 He took his wife, Sarai, his nephew Lot, and all his wealth - his livestock and all the people he had taken into his household at Haran - and headed for the land of Canaan. When they arrived in Canaan,
01Gn 12:6 Abram traveled through the land as far as Shechem. There he set up camp beside the oak of Moreh. At that time, the area was inhabited by Canaanites.
01Gn 12:7 Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, "I will give this land to your descendants��." And Abram built an altar there and dedicated it to the LORD, who had appeared to him. / ��Hebrew seed
01Gn 12:8 After that, Abram traveled south and set up camp in the hill country, with Bethel to the west and Ai to the east. There he built another altar and dedicated it to the LORD, and he worshiped the LORD.
01Gn 12:9 Then Abram continued traveling south by stages toward the Negev.
01Gn 12:10 At that time a severe famine struck the land of Canaan, forcing Abram to go down to Egypt, where he lived as a foreigner.
01Gn 12:11 As he was approaching the border of Egypt, Abram said to his wife, Sarai, "Look, you are a very beautiful woman.
01Gn 12:12 When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'This is his wife. Let's kill him; then we can have her!'
01Gn 12:13 So please tell them you are my sister. Then they will spare my life and treat me well because of their interest in you."
01Gn 12:14 And sure enough, when Abram arrived in Egypt, everyone noticed Sarai's beauty.
01Gn 12:15 When the palace officials saw her, they sang her praises to Pharaoh, their king, and Sarai was taken into his palace.
01Gn 12:16 Then Pharaoh gave Abram many gifts because of her - sheep, goats, cattle, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.
01Gn 12:17 But the LORD sent terrible plagues upon Pharaoh and his household because of Sarai, Abram's wife.
01Gn 12:18 So Pharaoh summoned Abram and accused him sharply. "What have you done to me?" he demanded. "Why didn't you tell me she was your wife?
01Gn 12:19 Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' and allow me to take her as my wife? Now then, here is your wife. Take her and get out of here!"
01Gn 12:20 Pharaoh ordered some of his men to escort them, and he sent Abram out of the country, along with his wife and all his possessions.
01Gn 13:1 So Abram left Egypt and traveled north into the Negev, along with his wife and Lot and all that they owned.
01Gn 13:2 (Abram was very rich in livestock, silver, and gold.)
01Gn 13:3 From the Negev, they continued traveling by stages toward Bethel, and they pitched their tents between Bethel and Ai, where they had camped before.
01Gn 13:4 This was the same place where Abram had built the altar, and there he worshiped the LORD again.
01Gn 13:5 Lot, who was traveling with Abram, had also become very wealthy with flocks of sheep and goats, herds of cattle, and many tents.
01Gn 13:6 But the land could not support both Abram and Lot with all their flocks and herds living so close together.
01Gn 13:7 So disputes broke out between the herdsmen of Abram and Lot. (At that time Canaanites and Perizzites were also living in the land.)
01Gn 13:8 Finally Abram said to Lot, "Let's not allow this conflict to come between us or our herdsmen. After all, we are close relatives!
01Gn 13:9 The whole countryside is open to you. Take your choice of any section of the land you want, and we will separate. If you want the land to the left, then I'll take the land on the right. If you prefer the land on the right, then I'll go to the left."
01Gn 13:10 Lot took a long look at the fertile plains of the Jordan Valley in the direction of Zoar. The whole area was well watered everywhere, like the garden of the LORD or the beautiful land of Egypt. (This was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.)
01Gn 13:11 Lot chose for himself the whole Jordan Valley to the east of them. He went there with his flocks and servants and parted company with his uncle Abram.
01Gn 13:12 So Abram settled in the land of Canaan, and Lot moved his tents to a place near Sodom and settled among the cities of the plain.
01Gn 13:13 But the people of this area were extremely wicked and constantly sinned against the LORD.
01Gn 13:14 After Lot had gone, the LORD said to Abram, "Look as far as you can see in every direction - north and south, east and west.
01Gn 13:15 I am giving all this land, as far as you can see, to you and your descendants�� as a permanent possession. / ��Hebrew seed; also in 13.16
01Gn 13:16 And I will give you so many descendants that, like the dust of the earth, they cannot be counted!
01Gn 13:17 Go and walk through the land in every direction, for I am giving it to you."
01Gn 13:18 So Abram moved his camp to Hebron and settled near the oak grove belonging to Mamre. There he built another altar to the LORD.
01Gn 14:1 About this time war broke out in the region. King Amraphel of Babylonia��, King Arioch of Ellasar, King Kedorlaomer of Elam, and King Tidal of Goiim / ��Hebrew Shinar; also in 14.9
01Gn 14:2 fought against King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (also called Zoar).
01Gn 14:3 This second group of kings joined forces in Siddim Valley (that is, the valley of the Dead Sea��). / ��Hebrew Salt Sea
01Gn 14:4 For twelve years they had been subject to King Kedorlaomer, but in the thirteenth year they rebelled against him.
01Gn 14:5 One year later Kedorlaomer and his allies arrived and defeated the Rephaites at Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzites at Ham, the Emites at Shaveh-kiriathaim,
01Gn 14:6 and the Horites at Mount Seir, as far as El-paran at the edge of the wilderness.
01Gn 14:7 Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (now called Kadesh) and conquered all the territory of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites living in Hazazon-tamar.
01Gn 14:8 Then the rebel kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (also called Zoar) prepared for battle in the valley of the Dead Sea��. / ��Hebrew Siddim Valley (see 14.3); also in 14.10
01Gn 14:9 They fought against King Kedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Babylonia, and King Arioch of Ellasar - four kings against five.
01Gn 14:10 As it happened, the valley of the Dead Sea was filled with tar pits. And as the army of the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some fell into the tar pits, while the rest escaped into the mountains.
01Gn 14:11 The victorious invaders then plundered Sodom and Gomorrah and headed for home, taking with them all the spoils of war and the food supplies.
01Gn 14:12 They also captured Lot - Abram's nephew who lived in Sodom - and carried off everything he owned.
01Gn 14:13 But one of Lot's men escaped and reported everything to Abram the Hebrew, who was living near the oak grove belonging to Mamre the Amorite. Mamre and his relatives, Eshcol and Aner, were Abram's allies.
01Gn 14:14 When Abram heard that his nephew Lot had been captured, he mobilized the 318 trained men who had been born into his household. Then he pursued Kedorlaomer's army until he caught up with them at Dan.
01Gn 14:15 There he divided his men and attacked during the night. Kedorlaomer's army fled, but Abram chased them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus.
01Gn 14:16 Abram recovered all the goods that had been taken, and he brought back his nephew Lot with his possessions and all the women and other captives.
01Gn 14:17 After Abram returned from his victory over Kedorlaomer and all his allies, the king of Sodom went out to meet him in the valley of Shaveh (that is, the King's Valley).
01Gn 14:18 And Melchizedek, the king of Salem and a priest of God Most High��, brought Abram some bread and wine. / ��Hebrew El-Elyon; also in 14.19, 20, 22
01Gn 14:19 Melchizedek blessed Abram with this blessing�� "Blessed be Abram by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth.
01Gn 14:20 And blessed be God Most High, who has defeated your enemies for you." Then Abram gave Melchizedek a tenth of all the goods he had recovered.
01Gn 14:21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give back my people who were captured. But you may keep for yourself all the goods you have recovered."
01Gn 14:22 Abram replied to the king of Sodom, "I solemnly swear to the LORD, God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
01Gn 14:23 that I will not take so much as a single thread or sandal thong from what belongs to you. Otherwise you might say, 'I am the one who made Abram rich.'
01Gn 14:24 I will accept only what my young warriors have already eaten, and I request that you give a fair share of the goods to my allies - Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre."
01Gn 15:1 Some time later, the LORD spoke to Abram in a vision and said to him, "Do not be afraid, Abram, for I will protect you, and your reward will be great."
01Gn 15:2 But Abram replied, "O Sovereign LORD, what good are all your blessings when I don't even have a son? Since you've given me no children, Eliezer of Damascus, a servant in my household, will inherit all my wealth.
01Gn 15:3 You have given me no descendants of my own, so one of my servants will be my heir."
01Gn 15:4 Then the LORD said to him, "No, your servant will not be your heir, for you will have a son of your own who will be your heir."
01Gn 15:5 Then the LORD took Abram outside and said to him, "Look up into the sky and count the stars if you can. That's how many descendants you will have!"
01Gn 15:6 And Abram believed the LORD, and the LORD counted him as righteous because of his faith.
01Gn 15:7 Then the LORD told him, "I am the LORD who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans to give you this land as your possession."
01Gn 15:8 But Abram replied, "O Sovereign LORD, how can I be sure that I will actually possess it?"
01Gn 15:9 The LORD told him, "Bring me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
01Gn 15:10 So Abram presented all these to him and killed them. Then he cut each animal down the middle and laid the halves side by side; he did not, however, cut the birds in half.
01Gn 15:11 Some vultures swooped down to eat the carcasses, but Abram chased them away.
01Gn 15:12 As the sun was going down, Abram fell into a deep sleep, and a terrifying darkness came down over him.
01Gn 15:13 Then the LORD said to Abram, "You can be sure that your descendants will be strangers in a foreign land, where they will be oppressed as slaves for 400 years.
01Gn 15:14 But I will punish the nation that enslaves them, and in the end they will come away with great wealth.
01Gn 15:15 (As for you, you will die in peace and be buried at a ripe old age.)
01Gn 15:16 After four generations your descendants will return here to this land, for the sins of the Amorites do not yet warrant their destruction."
01Gn 15:17 After the sun went down and darkness fell, Abram saw a smoking firepot and a flaming torch pass between the halves of the carcasses.
01Gn 15:18 So the LORD made a covenant with Abram that day and said, "I have given this land to your descendants, all the way from the border of Egypt�� to the great Euphrates River -  / ��Hebrew the river of Egypt, referring either to an eastern branch of the Nile River or to the Brook of Egypt in the Sinai (see Num 34.5)
01Gn 15:19 the land now occupied by the Kenites, Kenizzites, Kadmonites,
01Gn 15:20 Hittites, Perizzites, Rephaites,
01Gn 15:21 Amorites, Canaanites, Girgashites, and Jebusites."
01Gn 16:1 Now Sarai, Abram's wife, had not been able to bear children for him. But she had an Egyptian servant named Hagar.
01Gn 16:2 So Sarai said to Abram, "The LORD has prevented me from having children. Go and sleep with my servant. Perhaps I can have children through her." And Abram agreed with Sarai's proposal.
01Gn 16:3 So Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar the Egyptian servant and gave her to Abram as a wife. (This happened ten years after Abram had settled in the land of Canaan.)
01Gn 16:4 So Abram had sexual relations with Hagar, and she became pregnant. But when Hagar knew she was pregnant, she began to treat her mistress, Sarai, with contempt.
01Gn 16:5 Then Sarai said to Abram, "This is all your fault! I put my servant into your arms, but now that she's pregnant she treats me with contempt. The LORD will show who's wrong - you or me!"
01Gn 16:6 Abram replied, "Look, she is your servant, so deal with her as you see fit." Then Sarai treated Hagar so harshly that she finally ran away.
01Gn 16:7 The angel of the LORD found Hagar beside a spring of water in the wilderness, along the road to Shur.
01Gn 16:8 The angel said to her, "Hagar, Sarai's servant, where have you come from, and where are you going?" "I'm running away from my mistress, Sarai," she replied.
01Gn 16:9 The angel of the LORD said to her, "Return to your mistress, and submit to her authority."
01Gn 16:10 Then he added, "I will give you more descendants than you can count."
01Gn 16:11 And the angel also said, "You are now pregnant and will give birth to a son. You are to name him Ishmael (which means 'God hears'), for the LORD has heard your cry of distress.
01Gn 16:12 This son of yours will be a wild man, as untamed as a wild donkey! He will raise his fist against everyone, and everyone will be against him. Yes, he will live in open hostility against all his relatives."
01Gn 16:13 Thereafter, Hagar used another name to refer to the LORD, who had spoken to her. She said, "You are the God who sees me."�� She also said, "Have I truly seen the One who sees me?" / ��Hebrew El-roi
01Gn 16:14 So that well was named Beer-lahai-roi (which means "well of the Living One who sees me"). It can still be found between Kadesh and Bered.
01Gn 16:15 So Hagar gave Abram a son, and Abram named him Ishmael.
01Gn 16:16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Ishmael was born.
01Gn 17:1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, "I am El-Shaddai - 'God Almighty.' Serve me faithfully and live a blameless life.
01Gn 17:2 I will make a covenant with you, by which I will guarantee to give you countless descendants."
01Gn 17:3 At this, Abram fell face down on the ground. Then God said to him,
01Gn 17:4 "This is my covenant with you�� I will make you the father of a multitude of nations!
01Gn 17:5 What's more, I am changing your name. It will no longer be Abram. Instead, you will be called Abraham��, for you will be the father of many nations. / ��Abram means "exalted father"; Abraham sounds like a Hebrew term that means "father of many"
01Gn 17:6 I will make you extremely fruitful. Your descendants will become many nations, and kings will be among them!
01Gn 17:7 "I will confirm my covenant with you and your descendants�� after you, from generation to generation. This is the everlasting covenant�� I will always be your God and the God of your descendants after you. / ��Hebrew seed; also in 17.7b, 8, 9, 10, 19
01Gn 17:8 And I will give the entire land of Canaan, where you now live as a foreigner, to you and your descendants. It will be their possession forever, and I will be their God."
01Gn 17:9 Then God said to Abraham, "Your responsibility is to obey the terms of the covenant. You and all your descendants have this continual responsibility.
01Gn 17:10 This is the covenant that you and your descendants must keep�� Each male among you must be circumcised.
01Gn 17:11 You must cut off the flesh of your foreskin as a sign of the covenant between me and you.
01Gn 17:12 From generation to generation, every male child must be circumcised on the eighth day after his birth. This applies not only to members of your family but also to the servants born in your household and the foreign-born servants whom you have purchased.
01Gn 17:13 All must be circumcised. Your bodies will bear the mark of my everlasting covenant.
01Gn 17:14 Any male who fails to be circumcised will be cut off from the covenant family for breaking the covenant."
01Gn 17:15 Then God said to Abraham, "Regarding Sarai, your wife - her name will no longer be Sarai. From now on her name will be Sarah��. / ��Sarai and Sarah both mean "princess";the change in spelling may reflect the difference in dialect between Ur and Canaan
01Gn 17:16 And I will bless her and give you a son from her! Yes, I will bless her richly, and she will become the mother of many nations. Kings of nations will be among her descendants."
01Gn 17:17 Then Abraham bowed down to the ground, but he laughed to himself in disbelief. "How could I become a father at the age of 100?" he thought. "And how can Sarah have a baby when she is ninety years old?"
01Gn 17:18 So Abraham said to God, "May Ishmael live under your special blessing!"
01Gn 17:19 But God replied, "No - Sarah, your wife, will give birth to a son for you. You will name him Isaac��, and I will confirm my covenant with him and his descendants as an everlasting covenant. / ��Isaac means "he laughs"
01Gn 17:20 As for Ishmael, I will bless him also, just as you have asked. I will make him extremely fruitful and multiply his descendants. He will become the father of twelve princes, and I will make him a great nation.
01Gn 17:21 But my covenant will be confirmed with Isaac, who will be born to you and Sarah about this time next year."
01Gn 17:22 When God had finished speaking, he left Abraham.
01Gn 17:23 On that very day Abraham took his son, Ishmael, and every male in his household, including those born there and those he had bought. Then he circumcised them, cutting off their foreskins, just as God had told him.
01Gn 17:24 Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised,
01Gn 17:25 and Ishmael, his son, was thirteen.
01Gn 17:26 Both Abraham and his son, Ishmael, were circumcised on that same day,
01Gn 17:27 along with all the other men and boys of the household, whether they were born there or bought as servants. All were circumcised with him.
01Gn 18:1 The LORD appeared again to Abraham near the oak grove belonging to Mamre. One day Abraham was sitting at the entrance to his tent during the hottest part of the day.
01Gn 18:2 He looked up and noticed three men standing nearby. When he saw them, he ran to meet them and welcomed them, bowing low to the ground.
01Gn 18:3 "My lord," he said, "if it pleases you, stop here for a while.
01Gn 18:4 Rest in the shade of this tree while water is brought to wash your feet.
01Gn 18:5 And since you've honored your servant with this visit, let me prepare some food to refresh you before you continue on your journey." "All right," they said. "Do as you have said."
01Gn 18:6 So Abraham ran back to the tent and said to Sarah, "Hurry! Get three large measures�� of your best flour, knead it into dough, and bake some bread." / ��Hebrew 3 seahs, about 15 quarts or 18 liters
01Gn 18:7 Then Abraham ran out to the herd and chose a tender calf and gave it to his servant, who quickly prepared it.
01Gn 18:8 When the food was ready, Abraham took some yogurt and milk and the roasted meat, and he served it to the men. As they ate, Abraham waited on them in the shade of the trees.
01Gn 18:9 "Where is Sarah, your wife?" the visitors asked. "She's inside the tent," Abraham replied.
01Gn 18:10 Then one of them said, "I will return to you about this time next year, and your wife, Sarah, will have a son!" Sarah was listening to this conversation from the tent.
01Gn 18:11 Abraham and Sarah were both very old by this time, and Sarah was long past the age of having children.
01Gn 18:12 So she laughed silently to herself and said, "How could a worn-out woman like me enjoy such pleasure, especially when my master - my husband - is also so old?"
01Gn 18:13 Then the LORD said to Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh? Why did she say, 'Can an old woman like me have a baby?'
01Gn 18:14 Is anything too hard for the LORD? I will return about this time next year, and Sarah will have a son."
01Gn 18:15 Sarah was afraid, so she denied it, saying, "I didn't laugh." But the LORD said, "No, you did laugh."
01Gn 18:16 Then the men got up from their meal and looked out toward Sodom. As they left, Abraham went with them to send them on their way.
01Gn 18:17 "Should I hide my plan from Abraham?" the LORD asked.
01Gn 18:18 "For Abraham will certainly become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him.
01Gn 18:19 I have singled him out so that he will direct his sons and their families to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is right and just. Then I will do for Abraham all that I have promised."
01Gn 18:20 So the LORD told Abraham, "I have heard a great outcry from Sodom and Gomorrah, because their sin is so flagrant.
01Gn 18:21 I am going down to see if their actions are as wicked as I have heard. If not, I want to know."
01Gn 18:22 The other men turned and headed toward Sodom, but the LORD remained with Abraham.
01Gn 18:23 Abraham approached him and said, "Will you sweep away both the righteous and the wicked?
01Gn 18:24 Suppose you find fifty righteous people living there in the city - will you still sweep it away and not spare it for their sakes?
01Gn 18:25 Surely you wouldn't do such a thing, destroying the righteous along with the wicked. Why, you would be treating the righteous and the wicked exactly the same! Surely you wouldn't do that! Should not the Judge of all the earth do what is right?"
01Gn 18:26 And the LORD replied, "If I find fifty righteous people in Sodom, I will spare the entire city for their sake."
01Gn 18:27 Then Abraham spoke again. "Since I have begun, let me speak further to my Lord, even though I am but dust and ashes.
01Gn 18:28 Suppose there are only forty-five righteous people rather than fifty? Will you destroy the whole city for lack of five?" And the LORD said, "I will not destroy it if I find forty-five righteous people there."
01Gn 18:29 Then Abraham pressed his request further. "Suppose there are only forty?"  And the LORD replied, "I will not destroy it for the sake of the forty."
01Gn 18:30 "Please don't be angry, my Lord," Abraham pleaded. "Let me speak - suppose only thirty righteous people are found?"  And the LORD replied, "I will not destroy it if I find thirty."
01Gn 18:31 Then Abraham said, "Since I have dared to speak to the Lord, let me continue - suppose there are only twenty?" And the LORD replied, "Then I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty."
01Gn 18:32 Finally, Abraham said, "Lord, please don't be angry with me if I speak one more time. Suppose only ten are found there?" And the LORD replied, "Then I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten."
01Gn 18:33 When the LORD had finished his conversation with Abraham, he went on his way, and Abraham returned to his tent.
01Gn 19:1 That evening the two angels came to the entrance of the city of Sodom. Lot was sitting there, and when he saw them, he stood up to meet them. Then he welcomed them and bowed with his face to the ground.
01Gn 19:2 "My lords," he said, "come to my home to wash your feet, and be my guests for the night. You may then get up early in the morning and be on your way again." "Oh no," they replied. "We'll just spend the night out here in the city square."
01Gn 19:3 But Lot insisted, so at last they went home with him. Lot prepared a feast for them, complete with fresh bread made without yeast, and they ate.
01Gn 19:4 But before they retired for the night, all the men of Sodom, young and old, came from all over the city and surrounded the house.
01Gn 19:5 They shouted to Lot, "Where are the men who came to spend the night with you? Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them!"
01Gn 19:6 So Lot stepped outside to talk to them, shutting the door behind him.
01Gn 19:7 "Please, my brothers," he begged, "don't do such a wicked thing.
01Gn 19:8 Look, I have two virgin daughters. Let me bring them out to you, and you can do with them as you wish. But please, leave these men alone, for they are my guests and are under my protection."
01Gn 19:9 "Stand back!" they shouted. "This fellow came to town as an outsider, and now he's acting like our judge! We'll treat you far worse than those other men!" And they lunged toward Lot to break down the door.
01Gn 19:10 But the two angels�� reached out, pulled Lot into the house, and bolted the door. / ��Hebrew men; also in 19.12, 16
01Gn 19:11 Then they blinded all the men, young and old, who were at the door of the house, so they gave up trying to get inside.
01Gn 19:12 Meanwhile, the angels questioned Lot. "Do you have any other relatives here in the city?" they asked. "Get them out of this place - your sons-in-law, sons, daughters, or anyone else.
01Gn 19:13 For we are about to destroy this city completely. The outcry against this place is so great it has reached the LORD, and he has sent us to destroy it."
01Gn 19:14 So Lot rushed out to tell his daughters' fiances, "Quick, get out of the city! The LORD is about to destroy it." But the young men thought he was only joking.
01Gn 19:15 At dawn the next morning the angels became insistent. "Hurry," they said to Lot. "Take your wife and your two daughters who are here. Get out right now, or you will be swept away in the destruction of the city!"
01Gn 19:16 When Lot still hesitated, the angels seized his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters and rushed them to safety outside the city, for the LORD was merciful.
01Gn 19:17 When they were safely out of the city, one of the angels ordered, "Run for your lives! And don't look back or stop anywhere in the valley! Escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away!"
01Gn 19:18 "Oh no, my lord!" Lot begged.
01Gn 19:19 "You have been so gracious to me and saved my life, and you have shown such great kindness. But I cannot go to the mountains. Disaster would catch up to me there, and I would soon die.
01Gn 19:20 See, there is a small village nearby. Please let me go there instead; don't you see how small it is? Then my life will be saved."
01Gn 19:21 "All right," the angel said, "I will grant your request. I will not destroy the little village.
01Gn 19:22 But hurry! Escape to it, for I can do nothing until you arrive there." (This explains why that village was known as Zoar, which means "little place.")
01Gn 19:23 Lot reached the village just as the sun was rising over the horizon.
01Gn 19:24 Then the LORD rained down fire and burning sulfur from the sky on Sodom and Gomorrah.
01Gn 19:25 He utterly destroyed them, along with the other cities and villages of the plain, wiping out all the people and every bit of vegetation.
01Gn 19:26 But Lot's wife looked back as she was following behind him, and she turned into a pillar of salt.
01Gn 19:27 Abraham got up early that morning and hurried out to the place where he had stood in the LORD's presence.
01Gn 19:28 He looked out across the plain toward Sodom and Gomorrah and watched as columns of smoke rose from the cities like smoke from a furnace.
01Gn 19:29 But God had listened to Abraham's request and kept Lot safe, removing him from the disaster that engulfed the cities on the plain.
01Gn 19:30 Afterward Lot left Zoar because he was afraid of the people there, and he went to live in a cave in the mountains with his two daughters.
01Gn 19:31 One day the older daughter said to her sister, "There are no men left anywhere in this entire area, so we can't get married like everyone else. And our father will soon be too old to have children.
01Gn 19:32 Come, let's get him drunk with wine, and then we will have sex with him. That way we will preserve our family line through our father."
01Gn 19:33 So that night they got him drunk with wine, and the older daughter went in and had intercourse with her father. He was unaware of her lying down or getting up again.
01Gn 19:34 The next morning the older daughter said to her younger sister, "I had sex with our father last night. Let's get him drunk with wine again tonight, and you go in and have sex with him. That way we will preserve our family line through our father."
01Gn 19:35 So that night they got him drunk with wine again, and the younger daughter went in and had intercourse with him. As before, he was unaware of her lying down or getting up again.
01Gn 19:36 As a result, both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their own father.
01Gn 19:37 When the older daughter gave birth to a son, she named him Moab��. He became the ancestor of the nation now known as the Moabites. / ��Moab sounds like a Hebrew term that means "from father"
01Gn 19:38 When the younger daughter gave birth to a son, she named him Ben-ammi��. He became the ancestor of the nation now known as the Ammonites. / ��Ben-ammi means "son of my kinsman"
01Gn 20:1 Abraham moved south to the Negev and lived for a while between Kadesh and Shur, and then he moved on to Gerar. While living there as a foreigner,
01Gn 20:2 Abraham introduced his wife, Sarah, by saying, "She is my sister." So King Abimelech of Gerar sent for Sarah and had her brought to him at his palace.
01Gn 20:3 But that night God came to Abimelech in a dream and told him, "You are a dead man, for that woman you have taken is already married!"
01Gn 20:4 But Abimelech had not slept with her yet, so he said, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation?
01Gn 20:5 Didn't Abraham tell me, 'She is my sister'? And she herself said, 'Yes, he is my brother.' I acted in complete innocence! My hands are clean."
01Gn 20:6 In the dream God responded, "Yes, I know you are innocent. That's why I kept you from sinning against me, and why I did not let you touch her.
01Gn 20:7 Now return the woman to her husband, and he will pray for you, for he is a prophet. Then you will live. But if you don't return her to him, you can be sure that you and all your people will die."
01Gn 20:8 Abimelech got up early the next morning and quickly called all his servants together. When he told them what had happened, his men were terrified.
01Gn 20:9 Then Abimelech called for Abraham. "What have you done to us?" he demanded. "What crime have I committed that deserves treatment like this, making me and my kingdom guilty of this great sin? No one should ever do what you have done!
01Gn 20:10 Whatever possessed you to do such a thing?"
01Gn 20:11 Abraham replied, "I thought, 'This is a godless place. They will want my wife and will kill me to get her.'
01Gn 20:12 And she really is my sister, for we both have the same father, but different mothers. And I married her.
01Gn 20:13 When God called me to leave my father's home and to travel from place to place, I told her, 'Do me a favor. Wherever we go, tell the people that I am your brother.'"
01Gn 20:14 Then Abimelech took some of his sheep and goats, cattle, and male and female servants, and he presented them to Abraham. He also returned his wife, Sarah, to him.
01Gn 20:15 Then Abimelech said, "Look over my land and choose any place where you would like to live."
01Gn 20:16 And he said to Sarah, "Look, I am giving your 'brother' 1,000 pieces of silver�� in the presence of all these witnesses. This is to compensate you for any wrong I may have done to you. This will settle any claim against me, and your reputation is cleared." / ��Hebrew 1,000 [shekels] of silver, about 25 pounds or 11.4 kilograms in weight
01Gn 20:17 Then Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants, so they could have children.
01Gn 20:18 For the LORD had caused all the women to be infertile because of what happened with Abraham's wife, Sarah.
01Gn 21:1 The LORD kept his word and did for Sarah exactly what he had promised.
01Gn 21:2 She became pregnant, and she gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age. This happened at just the time God had said it would.
01Gn 21:3 And Abraham named their son Isaac.
01Gn 21:4 Eight days after Isaac was born, Abraham circumcised him as God had commanded.
01Gn 21:5 Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born.
01Gn 21:6 And Sarah declared, "God has brought me laughter��. All who hear about this will laugh with me. / ��The name Isaac means "he laughs"
01Gn 21:7 Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse a baby? Yet I have given Abraham a son in his old age!"
01Gn 21:8 When Isaac grew up and was about to be weaned, Abraham prepared a huge feast to celebrate the occasion.
01Gn 21:9 But Sarah saw Ishmael - the son of Abraham and her Egyptian servant Hagar - making fun of her son, Isaac��. / ��As in Greek version and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew lacks of her son, Isaac
01Gn 21:10 So she turned to Abraham and demanded, "Get rid of that slave woman and her son. He is not going to share the inheritance with my son, Isaac. I won't have it!"
01Gn 21:11 This upset Abraham very much because Ishmael was his son.
01Gn 21:12 But God told Abraham, "Do not be upset over the boy and your servant. Do whatever Sarah tells you, for Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted.
01Gn 21:13 But I will also make a nation of the descendants of Hagar's son because he is your son, too."
01Gn 21:14 So Abraham got up early the next morning, prepared food and a container of water, and strapped them on Hagar's shoulders. Then he sent her away with their son, and she wandered aimlessly in the wilderness of Beersheba.
01Gn 21:15 When the water was gone, she put the boy in the shade of a bush.
01Gn 21:16 Then she went and sat down by herself about a hundred yards�� away. "I don't want to watch the boy die," she said, as she burst into tears. / ��Hebrew a bowshot
01Gn 21:17 But God heard the boy crying, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven, "Hagar, what's wrong? Do not be afraid! God has heard the boy crying as he lies there.
01Gn 21:18 Go to him and comfort him, for I will make a great nation from his descendants."
01Gn 21:19 Then God opened Hagar's eyes, and she saw a well full of water. She quickly filled her water container and gave the boy a drink.
01Gn 21:20 And God was with the boy as he grew up in the wilderness. He became a skillful archer,
01Gn 21:21 and he settled in the wilderness of Paran. His mother arranged for him to marry a woman from the land of Egypt.
01Gn 21:22 About this time, Abimelech came with Phicol, his army commander, to visit Abraham. "God is obviously with you, helping you in everything you do," Abimelech said.
01Gn 21:23 "Swear to me in God's name that you will never deceive me, my children, or any of my descendants. I have been loyal to you, so now swear that you will be loyal to me and to this country where you are living as a foreigner."
01Gn 21:24 Abraham replied, "Yes, I swear to it!"
01Gn 21:25 Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well that Abimelech's servants had taken by force from Abraham's servants.
01Gn 21:26 "This is the first I've heard of it," Abimelech answered. "I have no idea who is responsible. You have never complained about this before."
01Gn 21:27 Abraham then gave some of his sheep, goats, and cattle to Abimelech, and they made a treaty.
01Gn 21:28 But Abraham also took seven additional female lambs and set them off by themselves.
01Gn 21:29 Abimelech asked, "Why have you set these seven apart from the others?"
01Gn 21:30 Abraham replied, "Please accept these seven lambs to show your agreement that I dug this well."
01Gn 21:31 Then he named the place Beersheba (which means "well of the oath"), because that was where they had sworn the oath.
01Gn 21:32 After making their covenant at Beersheba, Abimelech left with Phicol, the commander of his army, and they returned home to the land of the Philistines.
01Gn 21:33 Then Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he worshiped the LORD, the Eternal God��. / ��Hebrew El-Olam
01Gn 21:34 And Abraham lived as a foreigner in Philistine country for a long time.
01Gn 22:1 Some time later, God tested Abraham's faith. "Abraham!" God called. "Yes," he replied. "Here I am."
01Gn 22:2 "Take your son, your only son - yes, Isaac, whom you love so much - and go to the land of Moriah. Go and sacrifice him as a burnt offering on one of the mountains, which I will show you."
01Gn 22:3 The next morning Abraham got up early. He saddled his donkey and took two of his servants with him, along with his son, Isaac. Then he chopped wood for a fire for a burnt offering and set out for the place God had told him about.
01Gn 22:4 On the third day of their journey, Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance.
01Gn 22:5 "Stay here with the donkey," Abraham told the servants. "The boy and I will travel a little farther. We will worship there, and then we will come right back."
01Gn 22:6 So Abraham placed the wood for the burnt offering on Isaac's shoulders, while he himself carried the fire and the knife. As the two of them walked on together,
01Gn 22:7 Isaac turned to Abraham and said, "Father?" "Yes, my son?" Abraham replied. "We have the fire and the wood," the boy said, "but where is the sheep for the burnt offering?"
01Gn 22:8 "God will provide a sheep for the burnt offering, my son," Abraham answered. And they both walked on together.
01Gn 22:9 When they arrived at the place where God had told him to go, Abraham built an altar and arranged the wood on it. Then he tied his son, Isaac, and laid him on the altar on top of the wood.
01Gn 22:10 And Abraham picked up the knife to kill his son as a sacrifice.
01Gn 22:11 At that moment the angel of the LORD called to him from heaven, "Abraham! Abraham!" "Yes," Abraham replied. "Here I am!"
01Gn 22:12 "Don't lay a hand on the boy!" the angel said. "Do not hurt him in any way, for now I know that you truly fear God. You have not withheld from me even your son, your only son."
01Gn 22:13 Then Abraham looked up and saw a ram caught by its horns in a thicket. So he took the ram and sacrificed it as a burnt offering in place of his son.
01Gn 22:14 Abraham named the place Yahweh-Yireh (which means "the LORD will provide"). To this day, people still use that name as a proverb�� "On the mountain of the LORD it will be provided."
01Gn 22:15 Then the angel of the LORD called again to Abraham from heaven.
01Gn 22:16 "This is what the LORD says�� Because you have obeyed me and have not withheld even your son, your only son, I swear by my own name that
01Gn 22:17 I will certainly bless you. I will multiply your descendants�� beyond number, like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will conquer the cities of their enemies. / ��Hebrew seed; also in 22.17b, 18
01Gn 22:18 And through your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed - all because you have obeyed me."
01Gn 22:19 Then they returned to the servants and traveled back to Beersheba, where Abraham continued to live.
01Gn 22:20 Soon after this, Abraham heard that Milcah, his brother Nahor's wife, had borne Nahor eight sons.
01Gn 22:21 The oldest was named Uz, the next oldest was Buz, followed by Kemuel (the ancestor of the Arameans),
01Gn 22:22 Kesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel.
01Gn 22:23 (Bethuel became the father of Rebekah.) In addition to these eight sons from Milcah,
01Gn 22:24 Nahor had four other children from his concubine Reumah. Their names were Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
01Gn 23:1 When Sarah was 127 years old,
01Gn 23:2 she died at Kiriath-arba (now called Hebron) in the land of Canaan. There Abraham mourned and wept for her.
01Gn 23:3 Then, leaving her body, he said to the Hittite elders,
01Gn 23:4 "Here I am, a stranger and a foreigner among you. Please sell me a piece of land so I can give my wife a proper burial."
01Gn 23:5 The Hittites replied to Abraham,
01Gn 23:6 "Listen, my lord, you are an honored prince among us. Choose the finest of our tombs and bury her there. No one here will refuse to help you in this way."
01Gn 23:7 Then Abraham bowed low before the Hittites
01Gn 23:8 and said, "Since you are willing to help me in this way, be so kind as to ask Ephron son of Zohar
01Gn 23:9 to let me buy his cave at Machpelah, down at the end of his field. I will pay the full price in the presence of witnesses, so I will have a permanent burial place for my family."
01Gn 23:10 Ephron was sitting there among the others, and he answered Abraham as the others listened, speaking publicly before all the Hittite elders of the town.
01Gn 23:11 "No, my lord," he said to Abraham, "please listen to me. I will give you the field and the cave. Here in the presence of my people, I give it to you. Go and bury your dead."
01Gn 23:12 Abraham again bowed low before the citizens of the land,
01Gn 23:13 and he replied to Ephron as everyone listened. "No, listen to me. I will buy it from you. Let me pay the full price for the field so I can bury my dead there."
01Gn 23:14 Ephron answered Abraham,
01Gn 23:15 "My lord, please listen to me. The land is worth 400 pieces�� of silver, but what is that between friends? Go ahead and bury your dead." / ��Hebrew 400 shekels, about 10 pounds or 4.6 kilograms in weight; also in 23.16
01Gn 23:16 So Abraham agreed to Ephron's price and paid the amount he had suggested - 400 pieces of silver, weighed according to the market standard. The Hittite elders witnessed the transaction.
01Gn 23:17 So Abraham bought the plot of land belonging to Ephron at Machpelah, near Mamre. This included the field itself, the cave that was in it, and all the surrounding trees.
01Gn 23:18 It was transferred to Abraham as his permanent possession in the presence of the Hittite elders at the city gate.
01Gn 23:19 Then Abraham buried his wife, Sarah, there in Canaan, in the cave of Machpelah, near Mamre (also called Hebron).
01Gn 23:20 So the field and the cave were transferred from the Hittites to Abraham for use as a permanent burial place.
01Gn 24:1 Abraham was now a very old man, and the LORD had blessed him in every way.
01Gn 24:2 One day Abraham said to his oldest servant, the man in charge of his household, "Take an oath by putting your hand under my thigh.
01Gn 24:3 Swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and earth, that you will not allow my son to marry one of these local Canaanite women.
01Gn 24:4 Go instead to my homeland, to my relatives, and find a wife there for my son Isaac."
01Gn 24:5 The servant asked, "But what if I can't find a young woman who is willing to travel so far from home? Should I then take Isaac there to live among your relatives in the land you came from?"
01Gn 24:6 "No!" Abraham responded. "Be careful never to take my son there.
01Gn 24:7 For the LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father's house and my native land, solemnly promised to give this land to my descendants��. He will send his angel ahead of you, and he will see to it that you find a wife there for my son. / ��Hebrew seed; also in 24.60
01Gn 24:8 If she is unwilling to come back with you, then you are free from this oath of mine. But under no circumstances are you to take my son there."
01Gn 24:9 So the servant took an oath by putting his hand under the thigh of his master, Abraham. He swore to follow Abraham's instructions.
01Gn 24:10 Then he loaded ten of Abraham's camels with all kinds of expensive gifts from his master, and he traveled to distant Aram-naharaim. There he went to the town where Abraham's brother Nahor had settled.
01Gn 24:11 He made the camels kneel beside a well just outside the town. It was evening, and the women were coming out to draw water.
01Gn 24:12 "O LORD, God of my master, Abraham," he prayed. "Please give me success today, and show unfailing love to my master, Abraham.
01Gn 24:13 See, I am standing here beside this spring, and the young women of the town are coming out to draw water.
01Gn 24:14 This is my request. I will ask one of them, 'Please give me a drink from your jug.' If she says, 'Yes, have a drink, and I will water your camels, too!' - let her be the one you have selected as Isaac's wife. This is how I will know that you have shown unfailing love to my master."
01Gn 24:15 Before he had finished praying, he saw a young woman named Rebekah coming out with her water jug on her shoulder. She was the daughter of Bethuel, who was the son of Abraham's brother Nahor and his wife, Milcah.
01Gn 24:16 Rebekah was very beautiful and old enough to be married, but she was still a virgin. She went down to the spring, filled her jug, and came up again.
01Gn 24:17 Running over to her, the servant said, "Please give me a little drink of water from your jug."
01Gn 24:18 "Yes, my lord," she answered, "have a drink." And she quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and gave him a drink.
01Gn 24:19 When she had given him a drink, she said, "I'll draw water for your camels, too, until they have had enough to drink."
01Gn 24:20 So she quickly emptied her jug into the watering trough and ran back to the well to draw water for all his camels.
01Gn 24:21 The servant watched her in silence, wondering whether or not the LORD had given him success in his mission.
01Gn 24:22 Then at last, when the camels had finished drinking, he took out a gold ring for her nose and two large gold bracelets�� for her wrists. / ��Hebrew a gold nose-ring weighing a half shekel [0.2 ounces or 6 grams] and two gold bracelets weighing 10 shekels [4 ounces or 114 grams]
01Gn 24:23 "Whose daughter are you?" he asked. "And please tell me, would your father have any room to put us up for the night?"
01Gn 24:24 "I am the daughter of Bethuel," she replied. "My grandparents are Nahor and Milcah.
01Gn 24:25 Yes, we have plenty of straw and feed for the camels, and we have room for guests."
01Gn 24:26 The man bowed low and worshiped the LORD.
01Gn 24:27 "Praise the LORD, the God of my master, Abraham," he said. "The LORD has shown unfailing love and faithfulness to my master, for he has led me straight to my master's relatives."
01Gn 24:28 The young woman ran home to tell her family everything that had happened.
01Gn 24:29 Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, who ran out to meet the man at the spring.
01Gn 24:30 He had seen the nose-ring and the bracelets on his sister's wrists, and had heard Rebekah tell what the man had said. So he rushed out to the spring, where the man was still standing beside his camels.
01Gn 24:31 Laban said to him, "Come and stay with us, you who are blessed by the LORD! Why are you standing here outside the town when I have a room all ready for you and a place prepared for the camels?"
01Gn 24:32 So the man went home with Laban, and Laban unloaded the camels, gave him straw for their bedding, fed them, and provided water for the man and the camel drivers to wash their feet.
01Gn 24:33 Then food was served. But Abraham's servant said, "I don't want to eat until I have told you why I have come." "All right," Laban said, "tell us."
01Gn 24:34 "I am Abraham's servant," he explained.
01Gn 24:35 "And the LORD has greatly blessed my master; he has become a wealthy man. The LORD has given him flocks of sheep and goats, herds of cattle, a fortune in silver and gold, and many male and female servants and camels and donkeys.
01Gn 24:36 "When Sarah, my master's wife, was very old, she gave birth to my master's son, and my master has given him everything he owns.
01Gn 24:37 And my master made me take an oath. He said, 'Do not allow my son to marry one of these local Canaanite women.
01Gn 24:38 Go instead to my father's house, to my relatives, and find a wife there for my son.'
01Gn 24:39 "But I said to my master, 'What if I can't find a young woman who is willing to go back with me?'
01Gn 24:40 He responded, 'The LORD, in whose presence I have lived, will send his angel with you and will make your mission successful. Yes, you must find a wife for my son from among my relatives, from my father's family.
01Gn 24:41 Then you will have fulfilled your obligation. But if you go to my relatives and they refuse to let her go with you, you will be free from my oath.'
01Gn 24:42 "So today when I came to the spring, I prayed this prayer�� 'O LORD, God of my master, Abraham, please give me success on this mission.
01Gn 24:43 See, I am standing here beside this spring. This is my request. When a young woman comes to draw water, I will say to her, "Please give me a little drink of water from your jug."
01Gn 24:44 If she says, "Yes, have a drink, and I will draw water for your camels, too," let her be the one you have selected to be the wife of my master's son.'
01Gn 24:45 "Before I had finished praying in my heart, I saw Rebekah coming out with her water jug on her shoulder. She went down to the spring and drew water. So I said to her, 'Please give me a drink.'
01Gn 24:46 She quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and said, 'Yes, have a drink, and I will water your camels, too!' So I drank, and then she watered the camels.
01Gn 24:47 "Then I asked, 'Whose daughter are you?' She replied, 'I am the daughter of Bethuel, and my grandparents are Nahor and Milcah.' So I put the ring on her nose, and the bracelets on her wrists.
01Gn 24:48 "Then I bowed low and worshiped the LORD. I praised the LORD, the God of my master, Abraham, because he had led me straight to my master's niece to be his son's wife.
01Gn 24:49 So tell me - will you or won't you show unfailing love and faithfulness to my master? Please tell me yes or no, and then I'll know what to do next."
01Gn 24:50 Then Laban and Bethuel replied, "The LORD has obviously brought you here, so there is nothing we can say.
01Gn 24:51 Here is Rebekah; take her and go. Yes, let her be the wife of your master's son, as the LORD has directed."
01Gn 24:52 When Abraham's servant heard their answer, he bowed down to the ground and worshiped the LORD.
01Gn 24:53 Then he brought out silver and gold jewelry and clothing and presented them to Rebekah. He also gave expensive presents to her brother and mother.
01Gn 24:54 Then they ate their meal, and the servant and the men with him stayed there overnight. But early the next morning, Abraham's servant said, "Send me back to my master."
01Gn 24:55 "But we want Rebekah to stay with us at least ten days," her brother and mother said. "Then she can go."
01Gn 24:56 But he said, "Don't delay me. The LORD has made my mission successful; now send me back so I can return to my master."
01Gn 24:57 "Well," they said, "we'll call Rebekah and ask her what she thinks."
01Gn 24:58 So they called Rebekah. "Are you willing to go with this man?" they asked her. And she replied, "Yes, I will go."
01Gn 24:59 So they said good-bye to Rebekah and sent her away with Abraham's servant and his men. The woman who had been Rebekah's childhood nurse went along with her.
01Gn 24:60 They gave her this blessing as she parted�� "Our sister, may you become the mother of many millions! May your descendants be strong and conquer the cities of their enemies."
01Gn 24:61 Then Rebekah and her servant girls mounted the camels and followed the man. So Abraham's servant took Rebekah and went on his way.
01Gn 24:62 Meanwhile, Isaac, whose home was in the Negev, had returned from Beer-lahai-roi.
01Gn 24:63 One evening as he was walking and meditating in the fields, he looked up and saw the camels coming.
01Gn 24:64 When Rebekah looked up and saw Isaac, she quickly dismounted from her camel.
01Gn 24:65 "Who is that man walking through the fields to meet us?" she asked the servant. And he replied, "It is my master." So Rebekah covered her face with her veil.
01Gn 24:66 Then the servant told Isaac everything he had done.
01Gn 24:67 And Isaac brought Rebekah into his mother Sarah's tent, and she became his wife. He loved her deeply, and she was a special comfort to him after the death of his mother.
01Gn 25:1 Abraham married another wife, whose name was Keturah.
01Gn 25:2 She gave birth to Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah.
01Gn 25:3 Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. Dedan's descendants were the Asshurites, Letushites, and Leummites.
01Gn 25:4 Midian's sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. These were all descendants of Abraham through Keturah.
01Gn 25:5 Abraham gave everything he owned to his son Isaac.
01Gn 25:6 But before he died, he gave gifts to the sons of his concubines and sent them off to a land in the east, away from Isaac.
01Gn 25:7 Abraham lived for 175 years,
01Gn 25:8 and he died at a ripe old age, having lived a long and satisfying life. He breathed his last and joined his ancestors in death.
01Gn 25:9 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, near Mamre, in the field of Ephron son of Zohar the Hittite.
01Gn 25:10 This was the field Abraham had purchased from the Hittites and where he had buried his wife Sarah.
01Gn 25:11 After Abraham's death, God blessed his son Isaac, who settled near Beer-lahai-roi in the Negev.
01Gn 25:12 This is the account of the family of Ishmael, the son of Abraham through Hagar, Sarah's Egyptian servant.
01Gn 25:13 Here is a list, by their names and clans, of Ishmael's descendants�� The oldest was Nebaioth, followed by Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam,
01Gn 25:14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa,
01Gn 25:15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah.
01Gn 25:16 These twelve sons of Ishmael became the founders of twelve tribes named after them, listed according to the places they settled and camped.
01Gn 25:17 Ishmael lived for 137 years. Then he breathed his last and joined his ancestors in death.
01Gn 25:18 Ishmael's descendants occupied the region from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt in the direction of Asshur. There they lived in open hostility toward all their relatives��. / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
01Gn 25:19 This is the account of the family of Isaac, the son of Abraham.
01Gn 25:20 When Isaac was forty years old, he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean from Paddan-aram and the sister of Laban the Aramean.
01Gn 25:21 Isaac pleaded with the LORD on behalf of his wife, because she was unable to have children. The LORD answered Isaac's prayer, and Rebekah became pregnant with twins.
01Gn 25:22 But the two children struggled with each other in her womb. So she went to ask the LORD about it. "Why is this happening to me?" she asked.
01Gn 25:23 And the LORD told her, "The sons in your womb will become two nations. From the very beginning, the two nations will be rivals. One nation will be stronger than the other; and your older son will serve your younger son."
01Gn 25:24 And when the time came to give birth, Rebekah discovered that she did indeed have twins!
01Gn 25:25 The first one was very red at birth and covered with thick hair like a fur coat. So they named him Esau��. / ��Esau sounds like a Hebrew term that means "hair."
01Gn 25:26 Then the other twin was born with his hand grasping Esau's heel. So they named him Jacob��. Isaac was sixty years old when the twins were born. / ��Jacob sounds like the Hebrew words for "heel" and "deceiver"
01Gn 25:27 As the boys grew up, Esau became a skillful hunter. He was an outdoorsman, but Jacob had a quiet temperament, preferring to stay at home.
01Gn 25:28 Isaac loved Esau because he enjoyed eating the wild game Esau brought home, but Rebekah loved Jacob.
01Gn 25:29 One day when Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau arrived home from the wilderness exhausted and hungry.
01Gn 25:30 Esau said to Jacob, "I'm starved! Give me some of that red stew!" (This is how Esau got his other name, Edom, which means "red.")
01Gn 25:31 "All right," Jacob replied, "but trade me your rights as the firstborn son."
01Gn 25:32 "Look, I'm dying of starvation!" said Esau. "What good is my birthright to me now?"
01Gn 25:33 But Jacob said, "First you must swear that your birthright is mine." So Esau swore an oath, thereby selling all his rights as the firstborn to his brother, Jacob.
01Gn 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau some bread and lentil stew. Esau ate the meal, then got up and left. He showed contempt for his rights as the firstborn.
01Gn 26:1 A severe famine now struck the land, as had happened before in Abraham's time. So Isaac moved to Gerar, where Abimelech, king of the Philistines, lived.
01Gn 26:2 The LORD appeared to Isaac and said, "Do not go down to Egypt, but do as I tell you.
01Gn 26:3 Live here as a foreigner in this land, and I will be with you and bless you. I hereby confirm that I will give all these lands to you and your descendants��, just as I solemnly promised Abraham, your father. / ��Hebrew seed; also in 26.4, 24
01Gn 26:4 I will cause your descendants to become as numerous as the stars of the sky, and I will give them all these lands. And through your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed.
01Gn 26:5 I will do this because Abraham listened to me and obeyed all my requirements, commands, decrees, and instructions."
01Gn 26:6 So Isaac stayed in Gerar.
01Gn 26:7 When the men who lived there asked Isaac about his wife, Rebekah, he said, "She is my sister." He was afraid to say, "She is my wife." He thought, "They will kill me to get her, because she is so beautiful."
01Gn 26:8 But some time later, Abimelech, king of the Philistines, looked out his window and saw Isaac caressing Rebekah.
01Gn 26:9 Immediately, Abimelech called for Isaac and exclaimed, "She is obviously your wife! Why did you say, 'She is my sister'?" "Because I was afraid someone would kill me to get her from me," Isaac replied.
01Gn 26:10 "How could you do this to us?" Abimelech exclaimed. "One of my people might easily have taken your wife and slept with her, and you would have made us guilty of great sin."
01Gn 26:11 Then Abimelech issued a public proclamation�� "Anyone who touches this man or his wife will be put to death!"
01Gn 26:12 When Isaac planted his crops that year, he harvested a hundred times more grain than he planted, for the LORD blessed him.
01Gn 26:13 He became a very rich man, and his wealth continued to grow.
01Gn 26:14 He acquired so many flocks of sheep and goats, herds of cattle, and servants that the Philistines became jealous of him.
01Gn 26:15 So the Philistines filled up all of Isaac's wells with dirt. These were the wells that had been dug by the servants of his father, Abraham.
01Gn 26:16 Finally, Abimelech ordered Isaac to leave the country. "Go somewhere else," he said, "for you have become too powerful for us."
01Gn 26:17 So Isaac moved away to the Gerar Valley, where he set up their tents and settled down.
01Gn 26:18 He reopened the wells his father had dug, which the Philistines had filled in after Abraham's death. Isaac also restored the names Abraham had given them.
01Gn 26:19 Isaac's servants also dug in the Gerar Valley and discovered a well of fresh water.
01Gn 26:20 But then the shepherds from Gerar came and claimed the spring. "This is our water," they said, and they argued over it with Isaac's herdsmen. So Isaac named the well Esek (which means "argument").
01Gn 26:21 Isaac's men then dug another well, but again there was a dispute over it. So Isaac named it Sitnah (which means "hostility").
01Gn 26:22 Abandoning that one, Isaac moved on and dug another well. This time there was no dispute over it, so Isaac named the place Rehoboth (which means "open space"), for he said, "At last the LORD has created enough space for us to prosper in this land."
01Gn 26:23 From there Isaac moved to Beersheba,
01Gn 26:24 where the LORD appeared to him on the night of his arrival. "I am the God of your father, Abraham," he said. "Do not be afraid, for I am with you and will bless you. I will multiply your descendants, and they will become a great nation. I will do this because of my promise to Abraham, my servant."
01Gn 26:25 Then Isaac built an altar there and worshiped the LORD. He set up his camp at that place, and his servants dug another well.
01Gn 26:26 One day King Abimelech came from Gerar with his adviser, Ahuzzath, and also Phicol, his army commander.
01Gn 26:27 "Why have you come here?" Isaac asked. "You obviously hate me, since you kicked me off your land."
01Gn 26:28 They replied, "We can plainly see that the LORD is with you. So we want to enter into a sworn treaty with you. Let's make a covenant.
01Gn 26:29 Swear that you will not harm us, just as we have never troubled you. We have always treated you well, and we sent you away from us in peace. And now look how the LORD has blessed you!"
01Gn 26:30 So Isaac prepared a covenant feast to celebrate the treaty, and they ate and drank together.
01Gn 26:31 Early the next morning, they each took a solemn oath not to interfere with each other. Then Isaac sent them home again, and they left him in peace.
01Gn 26:32 That very day Isaac's servants came and told him about a new well they had dug. "We've found water!" they exclaimed.
01Gn 26:33 So Isaac named the well Shibah (which means "oath"). And to this day the town that grew up there is called Beersheba (which means "well of the oath").
01Gn 26:34 At the age of forty, Esau married two Hittite wives�� Judith, the daughter of Beeri, and Basemath, the daughter of Elon.
01Gn 26:35 But Esau's wives made life miserable for Isaac and Rebekah.
01Gn 27:1 One day when Isaac was old and turning blind, he called for Esau, his older son, and said, "My son." "Yes, Father?" Esau replied.
01Gn 27:2 "I am an old man now," Isaac said, "and I don't know when I may die.
01Gn 27:3 Take your bow and a quiver full of arrows, and go out into the open country to hunt some wild game for me.
01Gn 27:4 Prepare my favorite dish, and bring it here for me to eat. Then I will pronounce the blessing that belongs to you, my firstborn son, before I die."
01Gn 27:5 But Rebekah overheard what Isaac had said to his son Esau. So when Esau left to hunt for the wild game,
01Gn 27:6 she said to her son Jacob, "Listen. I overheard your father say to Esau,
01Gn 27:7 'Bring me some wild game and prepare me a delicious meal. Then I will bless you in the LORD's presence before I die.'
01Gn 27:8 Now, my son, listen to me. Do exactly as I tell you.
01Gn 27:9 Go out to the flocks, and bring me two fine young goats. I'll use them to prepare your father's favorite dish.
01Gn 27:10 Then take the food to your father so he can eat it and bless you before he dies."
01Gn 27:11 "But look," Jacob replied to Rebekah, "my brother, Esau, is a hairy man, and my skin is smooth.
01Gn 27:12 What if my father touches me? He'll see that I'm trying to trick him, and then he'll curse me instead of blessing me."
01Gn 27:13 But his mother replied, "Then let the curse fall on me, my son! Just do what I tell you. Go out and get the goats for me!"
01Gn 27:14 So Jacob went out and got the young goats for his mother. Rebekah took them and prepared a delicious meal, just the way Isaac liked it.
01Gn 27:15 Then she took Esau's favorite clothes, which were there in the house, and gave them to her younger son, Jacob.
01Gn 27:16 She covered his arms and the smooth part of his neck with the skin of the young goats.
01Gn 27:17 Then she gave Jacob the delicious meal, including freshly baked bread.
01Gn 27:18 So Jacob took the food to his father. "My father?" he said. "Yes, my son," Isaac answered. "Who are you - Esau or Jacob?"
01Gn 27:19 Jacob replied, "It's Esau, your firstborn son. I've done as you told me. Here is the wild game. Now sit up and eat it so you can give me your blessing."
01Gn 27:20 Isaac asked, "How did you find it so quickly, my son?" "The LORD your God put it in my path!" Jacob replied.
01Gn 27:21 Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Come closer so I can touch you and make sure that you really are Esau."
01Gn 27:22 So Jacob went closer to his father, and Isaac touched him. "The voice is Jacob's, but the hands are Esau's," Isaac said.
01Gn 27:23 But he did not recognize Jacob, because Jacob's hands felt hairy just like Esau's. So Isaac prepared to bless Jacob.
01Gn 27:24 "But are you really my son Esau?" he asked. "Yes, I am," Jacob replied.
01Gn 27:25 Then Isaac said, "Now, my son, bring me the wild game. Let me eat it, and then I will give you my blessing." So Jacob took the food to his father, and Isaac ate it. He also drank the wine that Jacob served him.
01Gn 27:26 Then Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come a little closer and kiss me, my son."
01Gn 27:27 So Jacob went over and kissed him. And when Isaac caught the smell of his clothes, he was finally convinced, and he blessed his son. He said, "Ah! The smell of my son is like the smell of the outdoors, which the LORD has blessed!
01Gn 27:28 "From the dew of heaven and the richness of the earth, may God always give you abundant harvests of grain and bountiful new wine.
01Gn 27:29 May many nations become your servants, and may they bow down to you. May you be the master over your brothers, and may your mother's sons bow down to you. All who curse you will be cursed, and all who bless you will be blessed."
01Gn 27:30 As soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and almost before Jacob had left his father, Esau returned from his hunt.
01Gn 27:31 Esau prepared a delicious meal and brought it to his father. Then he said, "Sit up, my father, and eat my wild game so you can give me your blessing."
01Gn 27:32 But Isaac asked him, "Who are you?"  Esau replied, "It's your son, your firstborn son, Esau."
01Gn 27:33 Isaac began to tremble uncontrollably and said, "Then who just served me wild game? I have already eaten it, and I blessed him just before you came. And yes, that blessing must stand!"
01Gn 27:34 When Esau heard his father's words, he let out a loud and bitter cry. "Oh my father, what about me? Bless me, too!" he begged.
01Gn 27:35 But Isaac said, "Your brother was here, and he tricked me. He has taken away your blessing."
01Gn 27:36 Esau exclaimed, "No wonder his name is Jacob, for now he has cheated me twice��. First he took my rights as the firstborn, and now he has stolen my blessing. Oh, haven't you saved even one blessing for me?" / ��Jacob sounds like the Hebrew words for "heel" and "deceiver"
01Gn 27:37 Isaac said to Esau, "I have made Jacob your master and have declared that all his brothers will be his servants. I have guaranteed him an abundance of grain and wine - what is left for me to give you, my son?"
01Gn 27:38 Esau pleaded, "But do you have only one blessing? Oh my father, bless me, too!" Then Esau broke down and wept.
01Gn 27:39 Finally, his father, Isaac, said to him, "You will live away from the richness of the earth, and away from the dew of the heaven above.
01Gn 27:40 You will live by your sword, and you will serve your brother. But when you decide to break free, you will shake his yoke from your neck."
01Gn 27:41 From that time on, Esau hated Jacob because their father had given Jacob the blessing. And Esau began to scheme�� "I will soon be mourning my father's death. Then I will kill my brother, Jacob."
01Gn 27:42 But Rebekah heard about Esau's plans. So she sent for Jacob and told him, "Listen, Esau is consoling himself by plotting to kill you.
01Gn 27:43 So listen carefully, my son. Get ready and flee to my brother, Laban, in Haran.
01Gn 27:44 Stay there with him until your brother cools off.
01Gn 27:45 When he calms down and forgets what you have done to him, I will send for you to come back. Why should I lose both of you in one day?"
01Gn 27:46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, "I'm sick and tired of these local Hittite women! I would rather die than see Jacob marry one of them."
01Gn 28:1 So Isaac called for Jacob, blessed him, and said, "You must not marry any of these Canaanite women.
01Gn 28:2 Instead, go at once to Paddan-aram, to the house of your grandfather Bethuel, and marry one of your uncle Laban's daughters.
01Gn 28:3 May God Almighty�� bless you and give you many children. And may your descendants multiply and become many nations! / ��Hebrew El-Shaddai
01Gn 28:4 May God pass on to you and your descendants�� the blessings he promised to Abraham. May you own this land where you are now living as a foreigner, for God gave this land to Abraham." / ��Hebrew seed; also in 28.13, 14
01Gn 28:5 So Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram to stay with his uncle Laban, his mother's brother, the son of Bethuel the Aramean.
01Gn 28:6 Esau knew that his father, Isaac, had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to find a wife, and that he had warned Jacob, "You must not marry a Canaanite woman."
01Gn 28:7 He also knew that Jacob had obeyed his parents and gone to Paddan-aram.
01Gn 28:8 It was now very clear to Esau that his father did not like the local Canaanite women.
01Gn 28:9 So Esau visited his uncle Ishmael's family and married one of Ishmael's daughters, in addition to the wives he already had. His new wife's name was Mahalath. She was the sister of Nebaioth and the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham's son.
01Gn 28:10 Meanwhile, Jacob left Beersheba and traveled toward Haran.
01Gn 28:11 At sundown he arrived at a good place to set up camp and stopped there for the night. Jacob found a stone to rest his head against and lay down to sleep.
01Gn 28:12 As he slept, he dreamed of a stairway that reached from the earth up to heaven. And he saw the angels of God going up and down the stairway.
01Gn 28:13 At the top of the stairway stood the LORD, and he said, "I am the LORD, the God of your grandfather Abraham, and the God of your father, Isaac. The ground you are lying on belongs to you. I am giving it to you and your descendants.
01Gn 28:14 Your descendants will be as numerous as the dust of the earth! They will spread out in all directions - to the west and the east, to the north and the south. And all the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your descendants.
01Gn 28:15 What's more, I am with you, and I will protect you wherever you go. One day I will bring you back to this land. I will not leave you until I have finished giving you everything I have promised you."
01Gn 28:16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and said, "Surely the LORD is in this place, and I wasn't even aware of it!"
01Gn 28:17 But he was also afraid and said, "What an awesome place this is! It is none other than the house of God, the very gateway to heaven!"
01Gn 28:18 The next morning Jacob got up very early. He took the stone he had rested his head against, and he set it upright as a memorial pillar. Then he poured olive oil over it.
01Gn 28:19 He named that place Bethel (which means "house of God"), although it was previously called Luz.
01Gn 28:20 Then Jacob made this vow�� "If God will indeed be with me and protect me on this journey, and if he will provide me with food and clothing,
01Gn 28:21 and if I return safely to my father's home, then the LORD will certainly be my God.
01Gn 28:22 And this memorial pillar I have set up will become a place for worshiping God, and I will present to God a tenth of everything he gives me."
01Gn 29:1 Then Jacob hurried on, finally arriving in the land of the east.
01Gn 29:2 He saw a well in the distance. Three flocks of sheep and goats lay in an open field beside it, waiting to be watered. But a heavy stone covered the mouth of the well.
01Gn 29:3 It was the custom there to wait for all the flocks to arrive before removing the stone and watering the animals. Afterward the stone would be placed back over the mouth of the well.
01Gn 29:4 Jacob went over to the shepherds and asked, "Where are you from, my friends?" "We are from Haran," they answered.
01Gn 29:5 "Do you know a man there named Laban, the grandson of Nahor?" he asked. "Yes, we do," they replied.
01Gn 29:6 "Is he doing well?" Jacob asked. "Yes, he's well," they answered. "Look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the flock now."
01Gn 29:7 Jacob said, "Look, it's still broad daylight - too early to round up the animals. Why don't you water the sheep and goats so they can get back out to pasture?"
01Gn 29:8 "We can't water the animals until all the flocks have arrived," they replied. "Then the shepherds move the stone from the mouth of the well, and we water all the sheep and goats."
01Gn 29:9 Jacob was still talking with them when Rachel arrived with her father's flock, for she was a shepherd.
01Gn 29:10 And because Rachel was his cousin - the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother - and because the sheep and goats belonged to his uncle Laban, Jacob went over to the well and moved the stone from its mouth and watered his uncle's flock.
01Gn 29:11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel, and he wept aloud.
01Gn 29:12 He explained to Rachel that he was her cousin on her father's side - the son of her aunt Rebekah. So Rachel quickly ran and told her father, Laban.
01Gn 29:13 As soon as Laban heard that his nephew Jacob had arrived, he ran out to meet him. He embraced and kissed him and brought him home. When Jacob had told him his story,
01Gn 29:14 Laban exclaimed, "You really are my own flesh and blood!" After Jacob had stayed with Laban for about a month,
01Gn 29:15 Laban said to him, "You shouldn't work for me without pay just because we are relatives. Tell me how much your wages should be."
01Gn 29:16 Now Laban had two daughters. The older daughter was named Leah, and the younger one was Rachel.
01Gn 29:17 There was no sparkle in Leah's eyes��, but Rachel had a beautiful figure and a lovely face. / ��Or Leah had dull eyes, or Leah had soft eyes. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
01Gn 29:18 Since Jacob was in love with Rachel, he told her father, "I'll work for you for seven years if you'll give me Rachel, your younger daughter, as my wife."
01Gn 29:19 "Agreed!" Laban replied. "I'd rather give her to you than to anyone else. Stay and work with me."
01Gn 29:20 So Jacob worked seven years to pay for Rachel. But his love for her was so strong that it seemed to him but a few days.
01Gn 29:21 Finally, the time came for him to marry her. "I have fulfilled my agreement," Jacob said to Laban. "Now give me my wife so I can sleep with her."
01Gn 29:22 So Laban invited everyone in the neighborhood and prepared a wedding feast.
01Gn 29:23 But that night, when it was dark, Laban took Leah to Jacob, and he slept with her.
01Gn 29:24 (Laban had given Leah a servant, Zilpah, to be her maid.)
01Gn 29:25 But when Jacob woke up in the morning - it was Leah! "What have you done to me?" Jacob raged at Laban. "I worked seven years for Rachel! Why have you tricked me?"
01Gn 29:26 "It's not our custom here to marry off a younger daughter ahead of the firstborn," Laban replied.
01Gn 29:27 "But wait until the bridal week is over, then we'll give you Rachel, too - provided you promise to work another seven years for me."
01Gn 29:28 So Jacob agreed to work seven more years. A week after Jacob had married Leah, Laban gave him Rachel, too.
01Gn 29:29 (Laban gave Rachel a servant, Bilhah, to be her maid.)
01Gn 29:30 So Jacob slept with Rachel, too, and he loved her much more than Leah. He then stayed and worked for Laban the additional seven years.
01Gn 29:31 When the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, he enabled her to have children, but Rachel could not conceive.
01Gn 29:32 So Leah became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She named him Reuben��, for she said, "The LORD has noticed my misery, and now my husband will love me." / ��Reuben means "Look, a son!" It also sounds like the Hebrew for "He has seen my misery"
01Gn 29:33 She soon became pregnant again and gave birth to another son. She named him Simeon��, for she said, "The LORD heard that I was unloved and has given me another son." / ��Simeon probably means "one who hears"
01Gn 29:34 Then she became pregnant a third time and gave birth to another son. She named him Levi��, for she said, "Surely this time my husband will feel affection for me, since I have given him three sons!" / ��Levi sounds like a Hebrew term that means "being attached" or "feeling affection for"
01Gn 29:35 Once again Leah became pregnant and gave birth to another son. She named him Judah��, for she said, "Now I will praise the LORD!" And then she stopped having children. / ��Judah is related to the Hebrew term for "praise"
01Gn 30:1 When Rachel saw that she wasn't having any children for Jacob, she became jealous of her sister. She pleaded with Jacob, "Give me children, or I'll die!"
01Gn 30:2 Then Jacob became furious with Rachel. "Am I God?" he asked. "He's the one who has kept you from having children!"
01Gn 30:3 Then Rachel told him, "Take my maid, Bilhah, and sleep with her. She will bear children for me��, and through her I can have a family, too." / ��Hebrew bear children on my knees
01Gn 30:4 So Rachel gave her servant, Bilhah, to Jacob as a wife, and he slept with her.
01Gn 30:5 Bilhah became pregnant and presented him with a son.
01Gn 30:6 Rachel named him Dan��, for she said, "God has vindicated me! He has heard my request and given me a son." / ��Dan means "he judged" or "he vindicated"
01Gn 30:7 Then Bilhah became pregnant again and gave Jacob a second son.
01Gn 30:8 Rachel named him Naphtali��, for she said, "I have struggled hard with my sister, and I'm winning!" / ��Naphtali means "my struggle"
01Gn 30:9 Meanwhile, Leah realized that she wasn't getting pregnant anymore, so she took her servant, Zilpah, and gave her to Jacob as a wife.
01Gn 30:10 Soon Zilpah presented him with a son.
01Gn 30:11 Leah named him Gad��, for she said, "How fortunate I am!" / ��Gad means "good fortune"
01Gn 30:12 Then Zilpah gave Jacob a second son.
01Gn 30:13 And Leah named him Asher��, for she said, "What joy is mine! Now the other women will celebrate with me." / ��Asher means "happy"
01Gn 30:14 One day during the wheat harvest, Reuben found some mandrakes growing in a field and brought them to his mother, Leah. Rachel begged Leah, "Please give me some of your son's mandrakes."
01Gn 30:15 But Leah angrily replied, "Wasn't it enough that you stole my husband? Now will you steal my son's mandrakes, too?" Rachel answered, "I will let Jacob sleep with you tonight if you give me some of the mandrakes."
01Gn 30:16 So that evening, as Jacob was coming home from the fields, Leah went out to meet him. "You must come and sleep with me tonight!" she said. "I have paid for you with some mandrakes that my son found." So that night he slept with Leah.
01Gn 30:17 And God answered Leah's prayers. She became pregnant again and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob.
01Gn 30:18 She named him Issachar��, for she said, "God has rewarded me for giving my servant to my husband as a wife." / ��Issachar sounds like a Hebrew term that means "reward"
01Gn 30:19 Then Leah became pregnant again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob.
01Gn 30:20 She named him Zebulun��, for she said, "God has given me a good reward. Now my husband will treat me with respect, for I have given him six sons." / ��Zebulun probably means "honor"
01Gn 30:21 Later she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.
01Gn 30:22 Then God remembered Rachel's plight and answered her prayers by enabling her to have children.
01Gn 30:23 She became pregnant and gave birth to a son. "God has removed my disgrace," she said.
01Gn 30:24 And she named him Joseph��, for she said, "May the LORD add yet another son to my family." / ��Joseph means "may he add"
01Gn 30:25 Soon after Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Please release me so I can go home to my own country.
01Gn 30:26 Let me take my wives and children, for I have earned them by serving you, and let me be on my way. You certainly know how hard I have worked for you."
01Gn 30:27 "Please listen to me," Laban replied. "I have become wealthy, for�� the LORD has blessed me because of you. / ��Or I have learned by divination that
01Gn 30:28 Tell me how much I owe you. Whatever it is, I'll pay it."
01Gn 30:29 Jacob replied, "You know how hard I've worked for you, and how your flocks and herds have grown under my care.
01Gn 30:30 You had little indeed before I came, but your wealth has increased enormously. The LORD has blessed you through everything I've done. But now, what about me? When can I start providing for my own family?"
01Gn 30:31 "What wages do you want?" Laban asked again. Jacob replied, "Don't give me anything. Just do this one thing, and I'll continue to tend and watch over your flocks.
01Gn 30:32 Let me inspect your flocks today and remove all the sheep and goats that are speckled or spotted, along with all the black sheep. Give these to me as my wages.
01Gn 30:33 In the future, when you check on the animals you have given me as my wages, you'll see that I have been honest. If you find in my flock any goats without speckles or spots, or any sheep that are not black, you will know that I have stolen them from you."
01Gn 30:34 "All right," Laban replied. "It will be as you say."
01Gn 30:35 But that very day Laban went out and removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted, all the female goats that were speckled and spotted or had white patches, and all the black sheep. He placed them in the care of his own sons,
01Gn 30:36 who took them a three-days' journey from where Jacob was. Meanwhile, Jacob stayed and cared for the rest of Laban's flock.
01Gn 30:37 Then Jacob took some fresh branches from poplar, almond, and plane trees and peeled off strips of bark, making white streaks on them.
01Gn 30:38 Then he placed these peeled branches in the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink, for that was where they mated.
01Gn 30:39 And when they mated in front of the white-streaked branches, they gave birth to young that were streaked, speckled, and spotted.
01Gn 30:40 Jacob separated those lambs from Laban's flock. And at mating time he turned the flock to face Laban's animals that were streaked or black. This is how he built his own flock instead of increasing Laban's.
01Gn 30:41 Whenever the stronger females were ready to mate, Jacob would place the peeled branches in the watering troughs in front of them. Then they would mate in front of the branches.
01Gn 30:42 But he didn't do this with the weaker ones, so the weaker lambs belonged to Laban, and the stronger ones were Jacob's.
01Gn 30:43 As a result, Jacob became very wealthy, with large flocks of sheep and goats, female and male servants, and many camels and donkeys.
01Gn 31:1 But Jacob soon learned that Laban's sons were grumbling about him. "Jacob has robbed our father of everything!" they said. "He has gained all his wealth at our father's expense."
01Gn 31:2 And Jacob began to notice a change in Laban's attitude toward him.
01Gn 31:3 Then the LORD said to Jacob, "Return to the land of your father and grandfather and to your relatives there, and I will be with you."
01Gn 31:4 So Jacob called Rachel and Leah out to the field where he was watching his flock.
01Gn 31:5 He said to them, "I have noticed that your father's attitude toward me has changed. But the God of my father has been with me.
01Gn 31:6 You know how hard I have worked for your father,
01Gn 31:7 but he has cheated me, changing my wages ten times. But God has not allowed him to do me any harm.
01Gn 31:8 For if he said, 'The speckled animals will be your wages,' the whole flock began to produce speckled young. And when he changed his mind and said, 'The striped animals will be your wages,' then the whole flock produced striped young.
01Gn 31:9 In this way, God has taken your father's animals and given them to me.
01Gn 31:10 "One time during the mating season, I had a dream and saw that the male goats mating with the females were streaked, speckled, and spotted.
01Gn 31:11 Then in my dream, the angel of God said to me, 'Jacob!' And I replied, 'Yes, here I am.'
01Gn 31:12 "The angel said, 'Look up, and you will see that only the streaked, speckled, and spotted males are mating with the females of your flock. For I have seen how Laban has treated you.
01Gn 31:13 I am the God who appeared to you at Bethel��, the place where you anointed the pillar of stone and made your vow to me. Now get ready and leave this country and return to the land of your birth.'" / ��As in Greek version and an Aramaic Targum; Hebrew reads the God of Bethel
01Gn 31:14 Rachel and Leah responded, "That's fine with us! We won't inherit any of our father's wealth anyway.
01Gn 31:15 He has reduced our rights to those of foreign women. And after he sold us, he wasted the money you paid him for us.
01Gn 31:16 All the wealth God has given you from our father legally belongs to us and our children. So go ahead and do whatever God has told you."
01Gn 31:17 So Jacob put his wives and children on camels,
01Gn 31:18 and he drove all his livestock in front of him. He packed all the belongings he had acquired in Paddan-aram and set out for the land of Canaan, where his father, Isaac, lived.
01Gn 31:19 At the time they left, Laban was some distance away, shearing his sheep. Rachel stole her father's household idols and took them with her.
01Gn 31:20 Jacob outwitted Laban the Aramean, for they set out secretly and never told Laban they were leaving.
01Gn 31:21 So Jacob took all his possessions with him and crossed the Euphrates River��, heading for the hill country of Gilead. / ��Hebrew the river
01Gn 31:22 Three days later, Laban was told that Jacob had fled.
01Gn 31:23 So he gathered a group of his relatives and set out in hot pursuit. He caught up with Jacob seven days later in the hill country of Gilead.
01Gn 31:24 But the previous night God had appeared to Laban the Aramean in a dream and told him, "I'm warning you - leave Jacob alone!"
01Gn 31:25 Laban caught up with Jacob as he was camped in the hill country of Gilead, and he set up his camp not far from Jacob's.
01Gn 31:26 "What do you mean by deceiving me like this?" Laban demanded. "How dare you drag my daughters away like prisoners of war?
01Gn 31:27 Why did you slip away secretly? Why did you deceive me? And why didn't you say you wanted to leave? I would have given you a farewell feast, with singing and music, accompanied by tambourines and harps.
01Gn 31:28 Why didn't you let me kiss my daughters and grandchildren and tell them good-bye? You have acted very foolishly!
01Gn 31:29 I could destroy you, but the God of your father appeared to me last night and warned me, 'Leave Jacob alone!'
01Gn 31:30 I can understand your feeling that you must go, and your intense longing for your father's home. But why have you stolen my gods?"
01Gn 31:31 "I rushed away because I was afraid," Jacob answered. "I thought you would take your daughters from me by force.
01Gn 31:32 But as for your gods, see if you can find them, and let the person who has taken them die! And if you find anything else that belongs to you, identify it before all these relatives of ours, and I will give it back!" But Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the household idols.
01Gn 31:33 Laban went first into Jacob's tent to search there, then into Leah's, and then the tents of the two servant wives - but he found nothing. Finally, he went into Rachel's tent.
01Gn 31:34 But Rachel had taken the household idols and hidden them in her camel saddle, and now she was sitting on them. When Laban had thoroughly searched her tent without finding them,
01Gn 31:35 she said to her father, "Please, sir, forgive me if I don't get up for you. I'm having my monthly period." So Laban continued his search, but he could not find the household idols.
01Gn 31:36 Then Jacob became very angry, and he challenged Laban. "What's my crime?" he demanded. "What have I done wrong to make you chase after me as though I were a criminal?
01Gn 31:37 You have rummaged through everything I own. Now show me what you found that belongs to you! Set it out here in front of us, before our relatives, for all to see. Let them judge between us!
01Gn 31:38 "For twenty years I have been with you, caring for your flocks. In all that time your sheep and goats never miscarried. In all those years I never used a single ram of yours for food.
01Gn 31:39 If any were attacked and killed by wild animals, I never showed you the carcass and asked you to reduce the count of your flock. No, I took the loss myself! You made me pay for every stolen animal, whether it was taken in broad daylight or in the dark of night.
01Gn 31:40 "I worked for you through the scorching heat of the day and through cold and sleepless nights.
01Gn 31:41 Yes, for twenty years I slaved in your house! I worked for fourteen years earning your two daughters, and then six more years for your flock. And you changed my wages ten times!
01Gn 31:42 In fact, if the God of my father had not been on my side - the God of Abraham and the fearsome God of Isaac�� - you would have sent me away empty-handed. But God has seen your abuse and my hard work. That is why he appeared to you last night and rebuked you!" / ��Or and the Fear of Isaac
01Gn 31:43 Then Laban replied to Jacob, "These women are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, and these flocks are my flocks - in fact, everything you see is mine. But what can I do now about my daughters and their children?
01Gn 31:44 So come, let's make a covenant, you and I, and it will be a witness to our commitment."
01Gn 31:45 So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a monument.
01Gn 31:46 Then he told his family members, "Gather some stones." So they gathered stones and piled them in a heap. Then Jacob and Laban sat down beside the pile of stones to eat a covenant meal.
01Gn 31:47 To commemorate the event, Laban called the place Jegar-sahadutha (which means "witness pile" in Aramaic), and Jacob called it Galeed (which means "witness pile" in Hebrew).
01Gn 31:48 Then Laban declared, "This pile of stones will stand as a witness to remind us of the covenant we have made today." This explains why it was called Galeed - "Witness Pile."
01Gn 31:49 But it was also called Mizpah (which means "watchtower"), for Laban said, "May the LORD keep watch between us to make sure that we keep this covenant when we are out of each other's sight.
01Gn 31:50 If you mistreat my daughters or if you marry other wives, God will see it even if no one else does. He is a witness to this covenant between us.
01Gn 31:51 "See this pile of stones," Laban continued, "and see this monument I have set between us.
01Gn 31:52 They stand between us as witnesses of our vows. I will never pass this pile of stones to harm you, and you must never pass these stones or this monument to harm me.
01Gn 31:53 I call on the God of our ancestors - the God of your grandfather Abraham and the God of my grandfather Nahor - to serve as a judge between us." So Jacob took an oath before the fearsome God of his father, Isaac��, to respect the boundary line. / ��Or the Fear of his father, Isaac
01Gn 31:54 Then Jacob offered a sacrifice to God there on the mountain and invited everyone to a covenant feast. After they had eaten, they spent the night on the mountain.
01Gn 31:55 ��Laban got up early the next morning, and he kissed his grandchildren and his daughters and blessed them. Then he left and returned home. / ��Verse 31.55 is numbered 32.1 in Hebrew text
01Gn 32:1 ��As Jacob started on his way again, angels of God came to meet him. / ��Verses 32.1-32 are numbered 32.2-33 in Hebrew text
01Gn 32:2 When Jacob saw them, he exclaimed, "This is God's camp!" So he named the place Mahanaim��. / ��Mahanaim means "two camps"
01Gn 32:3 Then Jacob sent messengers ahead to his brother, Esau, who was living in the region of Seir in the land of Edom.
01Gn 32:4 He told them, "Give this message to my master Esau�� 'Humble greetings from your servant Jacob. Until now I have been living with Uncle Laban,
01Gn 32:5 and now I own cattle, donkeys, flocks of sheep and goats, and many servants, both men and women. I have sent these messengers to inform my lord of my coming, hoping that you will be friendly to me.'"
01Gn 32:6 After delivering the message, the messengers returned to Jacob and reported, "We met your brother, Esau, and he is already on his way to meet you - with an army of 400 men!"
01Gn 32:7 Jacob was terrified at the news. He divided his household, along with the flocks and herds and camels, into two groups.
01Gn 32:8 He thought, "If Esau meets one group and attacks it, perhaps the other group can escape."
01Gn 32:9 Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my grandfather Abraham, and God of my father, Isaac - O LORD, you told me, 'Return to your own land and to your relatives.' And you promised me, 'I will treat you kindly.'
01Gn 32:10 I am not worthy of all the unfailing love and faithfulness you have shown to me, your servant. When I left home and crossed the Jordan River, I owned nothing except a walking stick. Now my household fills two large camps!
01Gn 32:11 O LORD, please rescue me from the hand of my brother, Esau. I am afraid that he is coming to attack me, along with my wives and children.
01Gn 32:12 But you promised me, 'I will surely treat you kindly, and I will multiply your descendants until they become as numerous as the sands along the seashore - too many to count.'"
01Gn 32:13 Jacob stayed where he was for the night. Then he selected these gifts from his possessions to present to his brother, Esau.
01Gn 32:14 200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams,
01Gn 32:15 30 female camels with their young, 40 cows, 10 bulls, 20 female donkeys, and 10 male donkeys.
01Gn 32:16 He divided these animals into herds and assigned each to different servants. Then he told his servants, "Go ahead of me with the animals, but keep some distance between the herds."
01Gn 32:17 He gave these instructions to the men leading the first group�� "When my brother, Esau, meets you, he will ask, 'Whose servants are you? Where are you going? Who owns these animals?'
01Gn 32:18 You must reply, 'They belong to your servant Jacob, but they are a gift for his master Esau. Look, he is coming right behind us.'"
01Gn 32:19 Jacob gave the same instructions to the second and third herdsmen and to all who followed behind the herds�� "You must say the same thing to Esau when you meet him.
01Gn 32:20 And be sure to say, 'Look, your servant Jacob is right behind us.'" Jacob thought, "I will try to appease him by sending gifts ahead of me. When I see him in person, perhaps he will be friendly to me."
01Gn 32:21 So the gifts were sent on ahead, while Jacob himself spent that night in the camp.
01Gn 32:22 During the night Jacob got up and took his two wives, his two servant wives, and his eleven sons and crossed the Jabbok River with them.
01Gn 32:23 After taking them to the other side, he sent over all his possessions.
01Gn 32:24 This left Jacob all alone in the camp, and a man came and wrestled with him until the dawn began to break.
01Gn 32:25 When the man saw that he would not win the match, he touched Jacob's hip and wrenched it out of its socket.
01Gn 32:26 Then the man said, "Let me go, for the dawn is breaking!"  But Jacob said, "I will not let you go unless you bless me."
01Gn 32:27 "What is your name?" the man asked.He replied, "Jacob."
01Gn 32:28 "Your name will no longer be Jacob," the man told him. "From now on you will be called Israel��, because you have fought with God and with men and have won." / ��Jacob sounds like the Hebrew words for "heel" and "deceiver." Israel means "God fights"
01Gn 32:29 "Please tell me your name," Jacob said. "Why do you want to know my name?" the man replied. Then he blessed Jacob there.
01Gn 32:30 Jacob named the place Peniel (which means "face of God"), for he said, "I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been spared."
01Gn 32:31 The sun was rising as Jacob left Peniel��, and he was limping because of the injury to his hip. / ��Hebrew Penuel, a variant spelling of Peniel
01Gn 32:32 (Even today the people of Israel don't eat the tendon near the hip socket because of what happened that night when the man strained the tendon of Jacob's hip.)
01Gn 33:1 Then Jacob looked up and saw Esau coming with his 400 men. So he divided the children among Leah, Rachel, and his two servant wives.
01Gn 33:2 He put the servant wives and their children at the front, Leah and her children next, and Rachel and Joseph last.
01Gn 33:3 Then Jacob went on ahead. As he approached his brother, he bowed to the ground seven times before him.
01Gn 33:4 Then Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, threw his arms around his neck, and kissed him. And they both wept.
01Gn 33:5 Then Esau looked at the women and children and asked, "Who are these people with you?" "These are the children God has graciously given to me, your servant," Jacob replied.
01Gn 33:6 Then the servant wives came forward with their children and bowed before him.
01Gn 33:7 Next came Leah with her children, and they bowed before him. Finally, Joseph and Rachel came forward and bowed before him.
01Gn 33:8 "And what were all the flocks and herds I met as I came?" Esau asked. Jacob replied, "They are a gift, my lord, to ensure your friendship."
01Gn 33:9 "My brother, I have plenty," Esau answered. "Keep what you have for yourself."
01Gn 33:10 But Jacob insisted, "No, if I have found favor with you, please accept this gift from me. And what a relief to see your friendly smile. It is like seeing the face of God!
01Gn 33:11 Please take this gift I have brought you, for God has been very gracious to me. I have more than enough." And because Jacob insisted, Esau finally accepted the gift.
01Gn 33:12 "Well," Esau said, "let's be going. I will lead the way."
01Gn 33:13 But Jacob replied, "You can see, my lord, that some of the children are very young, and the flocks and herds have their young, too. If they are driven too hard, even for one day, all the animals could die.
01Gn 33:14 Please, my lord, go ahead of your servant. We will follow slowly, at a pace that is comfortable for the livestock and the children. I will meet you at Seir."
01Gn 33:15 "All right," Esau said, "but at least let me assign some of my men to guide and protect you." Jacob responded, "That's not necessary. It's enough that you've received me warmly, my lord!"
01Gn 33:16 So Esau turned around and started back to Seir that same day.
01Gn 33:17 Jacob, on the other hand, traveled on to Succoth. There he built himself a house and made shelters for his livestock. That is why the place was named Succoth (which means "shelters").
01Gn 33:18 Later, having traveled all the way from Paddan-aram, Jacob arrived safely at the town of Shechem, in the land of Canaan. There he set up camp outside the town.
01Gn 33:19 Jacob bought the plot of land where he camped from the family of Hamor, the father of Shechem, for 100 pieces of silver��. / ��Hebrew 100 kesitahs; the value or weight of the kesitah is no longer known
01Gn 33:20 And there he built an altar and named it El-Elohe-Israel��. / ��El-Elohe-Israel means "God, the God of Israel"
01Gn 34:1 One day Dinah, the daughter of Jacob and Leah, went to visit some of the young women who lived in the area.
01Gn 34:2 But when the local prince, Shechem son of Hamor the Hivite, saw Dinah, he seized her and raped her.
01Gn 34:3 But then he fell in love with her, and he tried to win her affection with tender words.
01Gn 34:4 He said to his father, Hamor, "Get me this young girl. I want to marry her."
01Gn 34:5 Soon Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled his daughter, Dinah. But since his sons were out in the fields herding his livestock, he said nothing until they returned.
01Gn 34:6 Hamor, Shechem's father, came to discuss the matter with Jacob.
01Gn 34:7 Meanwhile, Jacob's sons had come in from the field as soon as they heard what had happened. They were shocked and furious that their sister had been raped. Shechem had done a disgraceful thing against Jacob's family��, something that should never be done. / ��Hebrew a disgraceful thing in Israel
01Gn 34:8 Hamor tried to speak with Jacob and his sons. "My son Shechem is truly in love with your daughter," he said. "Please let him marry her.
01Gn 34:9 In fact, let's arrange other marriages, too. You give us your daughters for our sons, and we will give you our daughters for your sons.
01Gn 34:10 And you may live among us; the land is open to you! Settle here and trade with us. And feel free to buy property in the area."
01Gn 34:11 Then Shechem himself spoke to Dinah's father and brothers. "Please be kind to me, and let me marry her," he begged. "I will give you whatever you ask.
01Gn 34:12 No matter what dowry or gift you demand, I will gladly pay it - just give me the girl as my wife."
01Gn 34:13 But since Shechem had defiled their sister, Dinah, Jacob's sons responded deceitfully to Shechem and his father, Hamor.
01Gn 34:14 They said to them, "We couldn't possibly allow this, because you're not circumcised. It would be a disgrace for our sister to marry a man like you!
01Gn 34:15 But here is a solution. If every man among you will be circumcised like we are,
01Gn 34:16 then we will give you our daughters, and we'll take your daughters for ourselves. We will live among you and become one people.
01Gn 34:17 But if you don't agree to be circumcised, we will take her and be on our way."
01Gn 34:18 Hamor and his son Shechem agreed to their proposal.
01Gn 34:19 Shechem wasted no time in acting on this request, for he wanted Jacob's daughter desperately. Shechem was a highly respected member of his family,
01Gn 34:20 and he went with his father, Hamor, to present this proposal to the leaders at the town gate.
01Gn 34:21 "These men are our friends," they said. "Let's invite them to live here among us and trade freely. Look, the land is large enough to hold them. We can take their daughters as wives and let them marry ours.
01Gn 34:22 But they will consider staying here and becoming one people with us only if all of our men are circumcised, just as they are.
01Gn 34:23 But if we do this, all their livestock and possessions will eventually be ours. Come, let's agree to their terms and let them settle here among us."
01Gn 34:24 So all the men in the town council agreed with Hamor and Shechem, and every male in the town was circumcised.
01Gn 34:25 But three days later, when their wounds were still sore, two of Jacob's sons, Simeon and Levi, who were Dinah's full brothers, took their swords and entered the town without opposition. Then they slaughtered every male there,
01Gn 34:26 including Hamor and his son Shechem. They killed them with their swords, then took Dinah from Shechem's house and returned to their camp.
01Gn 34:27 Meanwhile, the rest of Jacob's sons arrived. Finding the men slaughtered, they plundered the town because their sister had been defiled there.
01Gn 34:28 They seized all the flocks and herds and donkeys - everything they could lay their hands on, both inside the town and outside in the fields.
01Gn 34:29 They looted all their wealth and plundered their houses. They also took all their little children and wives and led them away as captives.
01Gn 34:30 Afterward Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have ruined me! You've made me stink among all the people of this land - among all the Canaanites and Perizzites. We are so few that they will join forces and crush us. I will be ruined, and my entire household will be wiped out!"
01Gn 34:31 "But why should we let him treat our sister like a prostitute?" they retorted angrily.
01Gn 35:1 Then God said to Jacob, "Get ready and move to Bethel and settle there. Build an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother, Esau."
01Gn 35:2 So Jacob told everyone in his household, "Get rid of all your pagan idols, purify yourselves, and put on clean clothing.
01Gn 35:3 We are now going to Bethel, where I will build an altar to the God who answered my prayers when I was in distress. He has been with me wherever I have gone."
01Gn 35:4 So they gave Jacob all their pagan idols and earrings, and he buried them under the great tree near Shechem.
01Gn 35:5 As they set out, a terror from God spread over the people in all the towns of that area, so no one attacked Jacob's family.
01Gn 35:6 Eventually, Jacob and his household arrived at Luz (also called Bethel) in Canaan.
01Gn 35:7 Jacob built an altar there and named the place El-bethel (which means "God of Bethel"), because God had appeared to him there when he was fleeing from his brother, Esau.
01Gn 35:8 Soon after this, Rebekah's old nurse, Deborah, died. She was buried beneath the oak tree in the valley below Bethel. Ever since, the tree has been called Allon-bacuth (which means "oak of weeping").
01Gn 35:9 Now that Jacob had returned from Paddan-aram, God appeared to him again at Bethel. God blessed him,
01Gn 35:10 saying, "Your name is Jacob, but you will not be called Jacob any longer. From now on your name will be Israel."�� So God renamed him Israel. / ��Jacob sounds like the Hebrew words for "heel" and "deceiver." Israel means "God fights"
01Gn 35:11 Then God said, "I am El-Shaddai - 'God Almighty.' Be fruitful and multiply. You will become a great nation, even many nations. Kings will be among your descendants!
01Gn 35:12 And I will give you the land I once gave to Abraham and Isaac. Yes, I will give it to you and your descendants after you."
01Gn 35:13 Then God went up from the place where he had spoken to Jacob.
01Gn 35:14 Jacob set up a stone pillar to mark the place where God had spoken to him. Then he poured wine over it as an offering to God and anointed the pillar with olive oil.
01Gn 35:15 And Jacob named the place Bethel (which means "house of God"), because God had spoken to him there.
01Gn 35:16 Leaving Bethel, Jacob and his clan moved on toward Ephrath. But Rachel went into labor while they were still some distance away. Her labor pains were intense.
01Gn 35:17 After a very hard delivery, the midwife finally exclaimed, "Don't be afraid - you have another son!"
01Gn 35:18 Rachel was about to die, but with her last breath she named the baby Ben-oni (which means "son of my sorrow"). The baby's father, however, called him Benjamin (which means "son of my right hand").
01Gn 35:19 So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).
01Gn 35:20 Jacob set up a stone monument over Rachel's grave, and it can be seen there to this day.
01Gn 35:21 Then Jacob�� traveled on and camped beyond Migdal-eder. / ��Hebrew Israel; also in 35.22a. The names "Jacob" and "Israel" are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation
01Gn 35:22 While he was living there, Reuben had intercourse with Bilhah, his father's concubine, and Jacob soon heard about it. These are the names of the twelve sons of Jacob.
01Gn 35:23 The sons of Leah were Reuben (Jacob's oldest son), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun.
01Gn 35:24 The sons of Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.
01Gn 35:25 The sons of Bilhah, Rachel's servant, were Dan and Naphtali.
01Gn 35:26 The sons of Zilpah, Leah's servant, were Gad and Asher. These are the names of the sons who were born to Jacob at Paddan-aram.
01Gn 35:27 So Jacob returned to his father, Isaac, in Mamre, which is near Kiriath-arba (now called Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had both lived as foreigners.
01Gn 35:28 Isaac lived for 180 years.
01Gn 35:29 Then he breathed his last and died at a ripe old age, joining his ancestors in death. And his sons, Esau and Jacob, buried him.
01Gn 36:1 This is the account of the descendants of Esau (also known as Edom).
01Gn 36:2 Esau married two young women from Canaan�� Adah, the daughter of Elon the Hittite; and Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon the Hivite.
01Gn 36:3 He also married his cousin Basemath, who was the daughter of Ishmael and the sister of Nebaioth.
01Gn 36:4 Adah gave birth to a son named Eliphaz for Esau. Basemath gave birth to a son named Reuel.
01Gn 36:5 Oholibamah gave birth to sons named Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. All these sons were born to Esau in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 36:6 Esau took his wives, his children, and his entire household, along with his livestock and cattle - all the wealth he had acquired in the land of Canaan - and moved away from his brother, Jacob.
01Gn 36:7 There was not enough land to support them both because of all the livestock and possessions they had acquired.
01Gn 36:8 So Esau (also known as Edom) settled in the hill country of Seir.
01Gn 36:9 This is the account of Esau's descendants, the Edomites, who lived in the hill country of Seir.
01Gn 36:10 These are the names of Esau's sons�� Eliphaz, the son of Esau's wife Adah; and Reuel, the son of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:11 The descendants of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz.
01Gn 36:12 Timna, the concubine of Esau's son Eliphaz, gave birth to a son named Amalek. These are the descendants of Esau's wife Adah.
01Gn 36:13 The descendants of Reuel were Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the descendants of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:14 Esau also had sons through Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah and granddaughter of Zibeon. Their names were Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.
01Gn 36:15 These are the descendants of Esau who became the leaders of various clans�� The descendants of Esau's oldest son, Eliphaz, became the leaders of the clans of Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz,
01Gn 36:16 Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These are the clan leaders in the land of Edom who descended from Eliphaz. All these were descendants of Esau's wife Adah.
01Gn 36:17 The descendants of Esau's son Reuel became the leaders of the clans of Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the clan leaders in the land of Edom who descended from Reuel. All these were descendants of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:18 The descendants of Esau and his wife Oholibamah became the leaders of the clans of Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the clan leaders who descended from Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah.
01Gn 36:19 These are the clans descended from Esau (also known as Edom), identified by their clan leaders.
01Gn 36:20 These are the names of the tribes that descended from Seir the Horite. They lived in the land of Edom�� Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
01Gn 36:21 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the Horite clan leaders, the descendants of Seir, who lived in the land of Edom.
01Gn 36:22 The descendants of Lotan were Hori and Hemam. Lotan�s sister was named Timna.
01Gn 36:23 The descendants of Shobal were Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
01Gn 36:24 The descendants of Zibeon were Aiah and Anah. (This is the Anah who discovered the hot springs in the wilderness while he was grazing his father's donkeys.)
01Gn 36:25 The descendants of Anah were his son, Dishon, and his daughter, Oholibamah.
01Gn 36:26 The descendants of Dishon�� were Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Keran. / ��Hebrew Dishan, a variant spelling of Dishon; compare 36.21, 28
01Gn 36:27 The descendants of Ezer were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
01Gn 36:28 The descendants of Dishan were Uz and Aran.
01Gn 36:29 So these were the leaders of the Horite clans�� Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah,
01Gn 36:30 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. The Horite clans are named after their clan leaders, who lived in the land of Seir.
01Gn 36:31 These are the kings who ruled in the land of Edom before any king ruled over the Israelites��. / ��Or before an Israelite king ruled over them
01Gn 36:32 Bela son of Beor, who ruled in Edom from his city of Dinhabah.
01Gn 36:33 When Bela died, Jobab son of Zerah from Bozrah became king in his place.
01Gn 36:34 When Jobab died, Husham from the land of the Temanites became king in his place.
01Gn 36:35 When Husham died, Hadad son of Bedad became king in his place and ruled from the city of Avith. He was the one who defeated the Midianites in the land of Moab.
01Gn 36:36 When Hadad died, Samlah from the city of Masrekah became king in his place.
01Gn 36:37 When Samlah died, Shaul from the city of Rehoboth-on-the-River became king in his place.
01Gn 36:38 When Shaul died, Baal-hanan son of Acbor became king in his place.
01Gn 36:39 When Baal-hanan son of Acbor died, Hadad�� became king in his place and ruled from the city of Pau. His wife was Mehetabel, the daughter of Matred and granddaughter of Me-zahab. / ��As in some Hebrew manuscripts, Samaritan Pentateuch, and Syriac version (see also 1 Chr 1.50); most Hebrew manuscripts read Hadar
01Gn 36:40 These are the names of the leaders of the clans descended from Esau, who lived in the places named for them�� Timna, Alvah, Jetheth,
01Gn 36:41 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon,
01Gn 36:42 Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar,
01Gn 36:43 Magdiel, and Iram. These are the leaders of the clans of Edom, listed according to their settlements in the land they occupied. They all descended from Esau, the ancestor of the Edomites.
01Gn 37:1 So Jacob settled again in the land of Canaan, where his father had lived as a foreigner.
01Gn 37:2 This is the account of Jacob and his family. When Joseph was seventeen years old, he often tended his father's flocks. He worked for his half brothers, the sons of his father's wives Bilhah and Zilpah. But Joseph reported to his father some of the bad things his brothers were doing.
01Gn 37:3 Jacob�� loved Joseph more than any of his other children because Joseph had been born to him in his old age. So one day Jacob had a special gift made for Joseph - a beautiful robe��. / ��Hebrew Israel; also in 37.13. See note on 35.21 ��Traditionally rendered a coat of many colors. The exact meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
01Gn 37:4 But his brothers hated Joseph because their father loved him more than the rest of them. They couldn't say a kind word to him.
01Gn 37:5 One night Joseph had a dream, and when he told his brothers about it, they hated him more than ever.
01Gn 37:6 "Listen to this dream," he said.
01Gn 37:7 "We were out in the field, tying up bundles of grain. Suddenly my bundle stood up, and your bundles all gathered around and bowed low before mine!"
01Gn 37:8 His brothers responded, "So you think you will be our king, do you? Do you actually think you will reign over us?" And they hated him all the more because of his dreams and the way he talked about them.
01Gn 37:9 Soon Joseph had another dream, and again he told his brothers about it. "Listen, I have had another dream," he said. "The sun, moon, and eleven stars bowed low before me!"
01Gn 37:10 This time he told the dream to his father as well as to his brothers, but his father scolded him. "What kind of dream is that?" he asked. "Will your mother and I and your brothers actually come and bow to the ground before you?"
01Gn 37:11 But while his brothers were jealous of Joseph, his father wondered what the dreams meant.
01Gn 37:12 Soon after this, Joseph's brothers went to pasture their father's flocks at Shechem.
01Gn 37:13 When they had been gone for some time, Jacob said to Joseph, "Your brothers are pasturing the sheep at Shechem. Get ready, and I will send you to them." "I'm ready to go," Joseph replied.
01Gn 37:14 "Go and see how your brothers and the flocks are getting along," Jacob said. "Then come back and bring me a report." So Jacob sent him on his way, and Joseph traveled to Shechem from their home in the valley of Hebron.
01Gn 37:15 When he arrived there, a man from the area noticed him wandering around the countryside. "What are you looking for?" he asked.
01Gn 37:16 "I'm looking for my brothers," Joseph replied. "Do you know where they are pasturing their sheep?"
01Gn 37:17 "Yes," the man told him. "They have moved on from here, but I heard them say, 'Let's go on to Dothan.'" So Joseph followed his brothers to Dothan and found them there.
01Gn 37:18 When Joseph's brothers saw him coming, they recognized him in the distance. As he approached, they made plans to kill him.
01Gn 37:19 "Here comes the dreamer!" they said.
01Gn 37:20 "Come on, let's kill him and throw him into one of these cisterns. We can tell our father, 'A wild animal has eaten him.' Then we'll see what becomes of his dreams!"
01Gn 37:21 But when Reuben heard of their scheme, he came to Joseph's rescue. "Let's not kill him," he said.
01Gn 37:22 "Why should we shed any blood? Let's just throw him into this empty cistern here in the wilderness. Then he'll die without our laying a hand on him." Reuben was secretly planning to rescue Joseph and return him to his father.
01Gn 37:23 So when Joseph arrived, his brothers ripped off the beautiful robe he was wearing.
01Gn 37:24 Then they grabbed him and threw him into the cistern. Now the cistern was empty; there was no water in it.
01Gn 37:25 Then, just as they were sitting down to eat, they looked up and saw a caravan of camels in the distance coming toward them. It was a group of Ishmaelite traders taking a load of gum, balm, and aromatic resin from Gilead down to Egypt.
01Gn 37:26 Judah said to his brothers, "What will we gain by killing our brother? We'd have to cover up the crime��. / ��Hebrew cover his blood
01Gn 37:27 Instead of hurting him, let's sell him to those Ishmaelite traders. After all, he is our brother - our own flesh and blood!" And his brothers agreed.
01Gn 37:28 So when the Ishmaelites, who were Midianite traders, came by, Joseph's brothers pulled him out of the cistern and sold him to them for twenty pieces�� of silver. And the traders took him to Egypt. / ��Hebrew 20 shekels, about 8 ounces or 228 grams in weight
01Gn 37:29 Some time later, Reuben returned to get Joseph out of the cistern. When he discovered that Joseph was missing, he tore his clothes in grief.
01Gn 37:30 Then he went back to his brothers and lamented, "The boy is gone! What will I do now?"
01Gn 37:31 Then the brothers killed a young goat and dipped Joseph's robe in its blood.
01Gn 37:32 They sent the beautiful robe to their father with this message�� "Look at what we found. Doesn't this robe belong to your son?"
01Gn 37:33 Their father recognized it immediately. "Yes," he said, "it is my son's robe. A wild animal must have eaten him. Joseph has clearly been torn to pieces!"
01Gn 37:34 Then Jacob tore his clothes and dressed himself in burlap. He mourned deeply for his son for a long time.
01Gn 37:35 His family all tried to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. "I will go to my grave�� mourning for my son," he would say, and then he would weep. / ��Hebrew go down to Sheol
01Gn 37:36 Meanwhile, the Midianite traders�� arrived in Egypt, where they sold Joseph to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. Potiphar was captain of the palace guard. / ��Hebrew the Medanites. The relationship between the Midianites and Medanites is unclear; compare 37.28. See also 25.2
01Gn 38:1 About this time, Judah left home and moved to Adullam, where he stayed with a man named Hirah.
01Gn 38:2 There he saw a Canaanite woman, the daughter of Shua, and he married her. When he slept with her,
01Gn 38:3 she became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and he named the boy Er.
01Gn 38:4 Then she became pregnant again and gave birth to another son, and she named him Onan.
01Gn 38:5 And when she gave birth to a third son, she named him Shelah. At the time of Shelah's birth, they were living at Kezib.
01Gn 38:6 In the course of time, Judah arranged for his firstborn son, Er, to marry a young woman named Tamar.
01Gn 38:7 But Er was a wicked man in the LORD's sight, so the LORD took his life.
01Gn 38:8 Then Judah said to Er's brother Onan, "Go and marry Tamar, as our law requires of the brother of a man who has died. You must produce an heir for your brother."
01Gn 38:9 But Onan was not willing to have a child who would not be his own heir. So whenever he had intercourse with his brother's wife, he spilled the semen on the ground. This prevented her from having a child who would belong to his brother.
01Gn 38:10 But the LORD considered it evil for Onan to deny a child to his dead brother. So the LORD took Onan's life, too.
01Gn 38:11 Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, "Go back to your parents' home and remain a widow until my son Shelah is old enough to marry you." (But Judah didn't really intend to do this because he was afraid Shelah would also die, like his two brothers.) So Tamar went back to live in her father's home.
01Gn 38:12 Some years later Judah's wife died. After the time of mourning was over, Judah and his friend Hirah the Adullamite went up to Timnah to supervise the shearing of his sheep.
01Gn 38:13 Someone told Tamar, "Look, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep."
01Gn 38:14 Tamar was aware that Shelah had grown up, but no arrangements had been made for her to come and marry him. So she changed out of her widow's clothing and covered herself with a veil to disguise herself. Then she sat beside the road at the entrance to the village of Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah.
01Gn 38:15 Judah noticed her and thought she was a prostitute, since she had covered her face.
01Gn 38:16 So he stopped and propositioned her. "Let me have sex with you," he said, not realizing that she was his own daughter-in-law. "How much will you pay to have sex with me?" Tamar asked.
01Gn 38:17 "I'll send you a young goat from my flock," Judah promised. "But what will you give me to guarantee that you will send the goat?" she asked.
01Gn 38:18 "What kind of guarantee do you want?" he replied. She answered, "Leave me your identification seal and its cord and the walking stick you are carrying." So Judah gave them to her. Then he had intercourse with her, and she became pregnant.
01Gn 38:19 Afterward she went back home, took off her veil, and put on her widow's clothing as usual.
01Gn 38:20 Later Judah asked his friend Hirah the Adullamite to take the young goat to the woman and to pick up the things he had given her as his guarantee. But Hirah couldn't find her.
01Gn 38:21 So he asked the men who lived there, "Where can I find the shrine prostitute who was sitting beside the road at the entrance to Enaim?" "We've never had a shrine prostitute here," they replied.
01Gn 38:22 So Hirah returned to Judah and told him, "I couldn't find her anywhere, and the men of the village claim they've never had a shrine prostitute there."
01Gn 38:23 "Then let her keep the things I gave her," Judah said. "I sent the young goat as we agreed, but you couldn't find her. We'd be the laughingstock of the village if we went back again to look for her."
01Gn 38:24 About three months later, Judah was told, "Tamar, your daughter-in-law, has acted like a prostitute. And now, because of this, she's pregnant." "Bring her out, and let her be burned!" Judah demanded.
01Gn 38:25 But as they were taking her out to kill her, she sent this message to her father-in-law�� "The man who owns these things made me pregnant. Look closely. Whose seal and cord and walking stick are these?"
01Gn 38:26 Judah recognized them immediately and said, "She is more righteous than I am, because I didn't arrange for her to marry my son Shelah." And Judah never slept with Tamar again.
01Gn 38:27 When the time came for Tamar to give birth, it was discovered that she was carrying twins.
01Gn 38:28 While she was in labor, one of the babies reached out his hand. The midwife grabbed it and tied a scarlet string around the child's wrist, announcing, "This one came out first."
01Gn 38:29 But then he pulled back his hand, and out came his brother! "What!" the midwife exclaimed. "How did you break out first?" So he was named Perez��. / ��Perez means "breaking out"
01Gn 38:30 Then the baby with the scarlet string on his wrist was born, and he was named Zerah��. / ��Zerah means "scarlet" or "brightness"
01Gn 39:1 When Joseph was taken to Egypt by the Ishmaelite traders, he was purchased by Potiphar, an Egyptian officer. Potiphar was captain of the guard for Pharaoh, the king of Egypt.
01Gn 39:2 The LORD was with Joseph, so he succeeded in everything he did as he served in the home of his Egyptian master.
01Gn 39:3 Potiphar noticed this and realized that the LORD was with Joseph, giving him success in everything he did.
01Gn 39:4 This pleased Potiphar, so he soon made Joseph his personal attendant. He put him in charge of his entire household and everything he owned.
01Gn 39:5 From the day Joseph was put in charge of his master's household and property, the LORD began to bless Potiphar's household for Joseph's sake. All his household affairs ran smoothly, and his crops and livestock flourished.
01Gn 39:6 So Potiphar gave Joseph complete administrative responsibility over everything he owned. With Joseph there, he didn't worry about a thing - except what kind of food to eat!  Joseph was a very handsome and well-built young man,
01Gn 39:7 and Potiphar's wife soon began to look at him lustfully. "Come and sleep with me," she demanded.
01Gn 39:8 But Joseph refused. "Look," he told her, "my master trusts me with everything in his entire household.
01Gn 39:9 No one here has more authority than I do. He has held back nothing from me except you, because you are his wife. How could I do such a wicked thing? It would be a great sin against God."
01Gn 39:10 She kept putting pressure on Joseph day after day, but he refused to sleep with her, and he kept out of her way as much as possible.
01Gn 39:11 One day, however, no one else was around when he went in to do his work.
01Gn 39:12 She came and grabbed him by his cloak, demanding, "Come on, sleep with me!" Joseph tore himself away, but he left his cloak in her hand as he ran from the house.
01Gn 39:13 When she saw that she was holding his cloak and he had fled,
01Gn 39:14 she called out to her servants. Soon all the men came running. "Look!" she said. "My husband has brought this Hebrew slave here to make fools of us! He came into my room to rape me, but I screamed.
01Gn 39:15 When he heard me scream, he ran outside and got away, but he left his cloak behind with me."
01Gn 39:16 She kept the cloak with her until her husband came home.
01Gn 39:17 Then she told him her story. "That Hebrew slave you've brought into our house tried to come in and fool around with me," she said.
01Gn 39:18 "But when I screamed, he ran outside, leaving his cloak with me!"
01Gn 39:19 Potiphar was furious when he heard his wife's story about how Joseph had treated her.
01Gn 39:20 So he took Joseph and threw him into the prison where the king's prisoners were held, and there he remained.
01Gn 39:21 But the LORD was with Joseph in the prison and showed him his faithful love. And the LORD made Joseph a favorite with the prison warden.
01Gn 39:22 Before long, the warden put Joseph in charge of all the other prisoners and over everything that happened in the prison.
01Gn 39:23 The warden had no more worries, because Joseph took care of everything. The LORD was with him and caused everything he did to succeed.
01Gn 40:1 Some time later, Pharaoh's chief cup-bearer and chief baker offended their royal master.
01Gn 40:2 Pharaoh became angry with these two officials,
01Gn 40:3 and he put them in the prison where Joseph was, in the palace of the captain of the guard.
01Gn 40:4 They remained in prison for quite some time, and the captain of the guard assigned them to Joseph, who looked after them.
01Gn 40:5 While they were in prison, Pharaoh's cup-bearer and baker each had a dream one night, and each dream had its own meaning.
01Gn 40:6 When Joseph saw them the next morning, he noticed that they both looked upset.
01Gn 40:7 "Why do you look so worried today?" he asked them.
01Gn 40:8 And they replied, "We both had dreams last night, but no one can tell us what they mean." "Interpreting dreams is God's business," Joseph replied. "Go ahead and tell me your dreams."
01Gn 40:9 So the chief cup-bearer told Joseph his dream first. "In my dream," he said, "I saw a grapevine in front of me.
01Gn 40:10 The vine had three branches that began to bud and blossom, and soon it produced clusters of ripe grapes.
01Gn 40:11 I was holding Pharaoh's wine cup in my hand, so I took a cluster of grapes and squeezed the juice into the cup. Then I placed the cup in Pharaoh's hand."
01Gn 40:12 "This is what the dream means," Joseph said. "The three branches represent three days.
01Gn 40:13 Within three days Pharaoh will lift you up and restore you to your position as his chief cup-bearer.
01Gn 40:14 And please remember me and do me a favor when things go well for you. Mention me to Pharaoh, so he might let me out of this place.
01Gn 40:15 For I was kidnapped from my homeland, the land of the Hebrews, and now I'm here in prison, but I did nothing to deserve it."
01Gn 40:16 When the chief baker saw that Joseph had given the first dream such a positive interpretation, he said to Joseph, "I had a dream, too. In my dream there were three baskets of white pastries stacked on my head.
01Gn 40:17 The top basket contained all kinds of pastries for Pharaoh, but the birds came and ate them from the basket on my head."
01Gn 40:18 "This is what the dream means," Joseph told him. "The three baskets also represent three days.
01Gn 40:19 Three days from now Pharaoh will lift you up and impale your body on a pole. Then birds will come and peck away at your flesh."
01Gn 40:20 Pharaoh's birthday came three days later, and he prepared a banquet for all his officials and staff. He summoned�� his chief cup-bearer and chief baker to join the other officials. / ��Hebrew He lifted up the head of
01Gn 40:21 He then restored the chief cup-bearer to his former position, so he could again hand Pharaoh his cup.
01Gn 40:22 But Pharaoh impaled the chief baker, just as Joseph had predicted when he interpreted his dream.
01Gn 40:23 Pharaoh's chief cup-bearer, however, forgot all about Joseph, never giving him another thought.
01Gn 41:1 Two full years later, Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing on the bank of the Nile River.
01Gn 41:2 In his dream he saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river and begin grazing in the marsh grass.
01Gn 41:3 Then he saw seven more cows come up behind them from the Nile, but these were scrawny and thin. These cows stood beside the fat cows on the riverbank.
01Gn 41:4 Then the scrawny, thin cows ate the seven healthy, fat cows! At this point in the dream, Pharaoh woke up.
01Gn 41:5 But he fell asleep again and had a second dream. This time he saw seven heads of grain, plump and beautiful, growing on a single stalk.
01Gn 41:6 Then seven more heads of grain appeared, but these were shriveled and withered by the east wind.
01Gn 41:7 And these thin heads swallowed up the seven plump, well-formed heads! Then Pharaoh woke up again and realized it was a dream.
01Gn 41:8 The next morning Pharaoh was very disturbed by the dreams. So he called for all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. When Pharaoh told them his dreams, not one of them could tell him what they meant.
01Gn 41:9 Finally, the king's chief cup-bearer spoke up. "Today I have been reminded of my failure," he told Pharaoh.
01Gn 41:10 "Some time ago, you were angry with the chief baker and me, and you imprisoned us in the palace of the captain of the guard.
01Gn 41:11 One night the chief baker and I each had a dream, and each dream had its own meaning.
01Gn 41:12 There was a young Hebrew man with us in the prison who was a slave of the captain of the guard. We told him our dreams, and he told us what each of our dreams meant.
01Gn 41:13 And everything happened just as he had predicted. I was restored to my position as cup-bearer, and the chief baker was executed and impaled on a pole."
01Gn 41:14 Pharaoh sent for Joseph at once, and he was quickly brought from the prison. After he shaved and changed his clothes, he went in and stood before Pharaoh.
01Gn 41:15 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I had a dream last night, and no one here can tell me what it means. But I have heard that when you hear about a dream you can interpret it."
01Gn 41:16 "It is beyond my power to do this," Joseph replied. "But God can tell you what it means and set you at ease."
01Gn 41:17 So Pharaoh told Joseph his dream. "In my dream," he said, "I was standing on the bank of the Nile River,
01Gn 41:18 and I saw seven fat, healthy cows come up out of the river and begin grazing in the marsh grass.
01Gn 41:19 But then I saw seven sick-looking cows, scrawny and thin, come up after them. I've never seen such sorry-looking animals in all the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:20 These thin, scrawny cows ate the seven fat cows.
01Gn 41:21 But afterward you wouldn't have known it, for they were still as thin and scrawny as before! Then I woke up.
01Gn 41:22 "Then I fell asleep again, and I had another dream. This time I saw seven heads of grain, full and beautiful, growing on a single stalk.
01Gn 41:23 Then seven more heads of grain appeared, but these were blighted, shriveled, and withered by the east wind.
01Gn 41:24 And the shriveled heads swallowed the seven healthy heads. I told these dreams to the magicians, but no one could tell me what they mean."
01Gn 41:25 Joseph responded, "Both of Pharaoh's dreams mean the same thing. God is telling Pharaoh in advance what he is about to do.
01Gn 41:26 The seven healthy cows and the seven healthy heads of grain both represent seven years of prosperity.
01Gn 41:27 The seven thin, scrawny cows that came up later and the seven thin heads of grain, withered by the east wind, represent seven years of famine.
01Gn 41:28 "This will happen just as I have described it, for God has revealed to Pharaoh in advance what he is about to do.
01Gn 41:29 The next seven years will be a period of great prosperity throughout the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:30 But afterward there will be seven years of famine so great that all the prosperity will be forgotten in Egypt. Famine will destroy the land.
01Gn 41:31 This famine will be so severe that even the memory of the good years will be erased.
01Gn 41:32 As for having two similar dreams, it means that these events have been decreed by God, and he will soon make them happen.
01Gn 41:33 "Therefore, Pharaoh should find an intelligent and wise man and put him in charge of the entire land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:34 Then Pharaoh should appoint supervisors over the land and let them collect one-fifth of all the crops during the seven good years.
01Gn 41:35 Have them gather all the food produced in the good years that are just ahead and bring it to Pharaoh's storehouses. Store it away, and guard it so there will be food in the cities.
01Gn 41:36 That way there will be enough to eat when the seven years of famine come to the land of Egypt. Otherwise this famine will destroy the land."
01Gn 41:37 Joseph's suggestions were well received by Pharaoh and his officials.
01Gn 41:38 So Pharaoh asked his officials, "Can we find anyone else like this man so obviously filled with the spirit of God?"
01Gn 41:39 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Since God has revealed the meaning of the dreams to you, clearly no one else is as intelligent or wise as you are.
01Gn 41:40 You will be in charge of my court, and all my people will take orders from you. Only I, sitting on my throne, will have a rank higher than yours."
01Gn 41:41 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I hereby put you in charge of the entire land of Egypt."
01Gn 41:42 Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand and placed it on Joseph's finger. He dressed him in fine linen clothing and hung a gold chain around his neck.
01Gn 41:43 Then he had Joseph ride in the chariot reserved for his second-in-command. And wherever Joseph went, the command was shouted, "Kneel down!" So Pharaoh put Joseph in charge of all Egypt.
01Gn 41:44 And Pharaoh said to him, "I am Pharaoh, but no one will lift a hand or foot in the entire land of Egypt without your approval."
01Gn 41:45 Then Pharaoh gave Joseph a new Egyptian name, Zaphenath-paneah��. He also gave him a wife, whose name was Asenath. She was the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On��. So Joseph took charge of the entire land of Egypt. / ��Zaphenath-paneah probably means "God speaks and lives" ��Greek version reads of Heliopolis; also in 41.50
01Gn 41:46 He was thirty years old when he began serving in the court of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. And when Joseph left Pharaoh's presence, he inspected the entire land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:47 As predicted, for seven years the land produced bumper crops.
01Gn 41:48 During those years, Joseph gathered all the crops grown in Egypt and stored the grain from the surrounding fields in the cities.
01Gn 41:49 He piled up huge amounts of grain like sand on the seashore. Finally, he stopped keeping records because there was too much to measure.
01Gn 41:50 During this time, before the first of the famine years, two sons were born to Joseph and his wife, Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On.
01Gn 41:51 Joseph named his older son Manasseh��, for he said, "God has made me forget all my troubles and everyone in my father's family." / ��Manasseh sounds like a Hebrew term that means "causing to forget"
01Gn 41:52 Joseph named his second son Ephraim��, for he said, "God has made me fruitful in this land of my grief." / ��Ephraim sounds like a Hebrew term that means "fruitful"
01Gn 41:53 At last the seven years of bumper crops throughout the land of Egypt came to an end.
01Gn 41:54 Then the seven years of famine began, just as Joseph had predicted. The famine also struck all the surrounding countries, but throughout Egypt there was plenty of food.
01Gn 41:55 Eventually, however, the famine spread throughout the land of Egypt as well. And when the people cried out to Pharaoh for food, he told them, "Go to Joseph, and do whatever he tells you."
01Gn 41:56 So with severe famine everywhere, Joseph opened up the storehouses and distributed grain to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe throughout the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:57 And people from all around came to Egypt to buy grain from Joseph because the famine was severe throughout the world.
01Gn 42:1 When Jacob heard that grain was available in Egypt, he said to his sons, "Why are you standing around looking at one another?
01Gn 42:2 I have heard there is grain in Egypt. Go down there, and buy enough grain to keep us alive. Otherwise we'll die."
01Gn 42:3 So Joseph's ten older brothers went down to Egypt to buy grain.
01Gn 42:4 But Jacob wouldn't let Joseph's younger brother, Benjamin, go with them, for fear some harm might come to him.
01Gn 42:5 So Jacob's�� sons arrived in Egypt along with others to buy food, for the famine was in Canaan as well. / ��Hebrew Israel's. See note on 35.21
01Gn 42:6 Since Joseph was governor of all Egypt and in charge of selling grain to all the people, it was to him that his brothers came. When they arrived, they bowed before him with their faces to the ground.
01Gn 42:7 Joseph recognized his brothers instantly, but he pretended to be a stranger and spoke harshly to them. "Where are you from?" he demanded. "From the land of Canaan," they replied. "We have come to buy food."
01Gn 42:8 Although Joseph recognized his brothers, they didn't recognize him.
01Gn 42:9 And he remembered the dreams he'd had about them many years before. He said to them, "You are spies! You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become."
01Gn 42:10 "No, my lord!" they exclaimed. "Your servants have simply come to buy food.
01Gn 42:11 We are all brothers - members of the same family. We are honest men, sir! We are not spies!"
01Gn 42:12 "Yes, you are!" Joseph insisted. "You have come to see how vulnerable our land has become."
01Gn 42:13 "Sir," they said, "there are actually twelve of us. We, your servants, are all brothers, sons of a man living in the land of Canaan. Our youngest brother is back there with our father right now, and one of our brothers is no longer with us."
01Gn 42:14 But Joseph insisted, "As I said, you are spies!
01Gn 42:15 This is how I will test your story. I swear by the life of Pharaoh that you will never leave Egypt unless your youngest brother comes here!
01Gn 42:16 One of you must go and get your brother. I'll keep the rest of you here in prison. Then we'll find out whether or not your story is true. By the life of Pharaoh, if it turns out that you don't have a younger brother, then I'll know you are spies."
01Gn 42:17 So Joseph put them all in prison for three days.
01Gn 42:18 On the third day Joseph said to them, "I am a God-fearing man. If you do as I say, you will live.
01Gn 42:19 If you really are honest men, choose one of your brothers to remain in prison. The rest of you may go home with grain for your starving families.
01Gn 42:20 But you must bring your youngest brother back to me. This will prove that you are telling the truth, and you will not die." To this they agreed.
01Gn 42:21 Speaking among themselves, they said, "Clearly we are being punished because of what we did to Joseph long ago. We saw his anguish when he pleaded for his life, but we wouldn't listen. That's why we're in this trouble."
01Gn 42:22 "Didn't I tell you not to sin against the boy?" Reuben asked. "But you wouldn't listen. And now we have to answer for his blood!"
01Gn 42:23 Of course, they didn't know that Joseph understood them, for he had been speaking to them through an interpreter.
01Gn 42:24 Now he turned away from them and began to weep. When he regained his composure, he spoke to them again. Then he chose Simeon from among them and had him tied up right before their eyes.
01Gn 42:25 Joseph then ordered his servants to fill the men's sacks with grain, but he also gave secret instructions to return each brother's payment at the top of his sack. He also gave them supplies for their journey home.
01Gn 42:26 So the brothers loaded their donkeys with the grain and headed for home.
01Gn 42:27 But when they stopped for the night and one of them opened his sack to get grain for his donkey, he found his money in the top of his sack.
01Gn 42:28 "Look!" he exclaimed to his brothers. "My money has been returned; it's here in my sack!" Then their hearts sank. Trembling, they said to each other, "What has God done to us?"
01Gn 42:29 When the brothers came to their father, Jacob, in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them.
01Gn 42:30 "The man who is governor of the land spoke very harshly to us," they told him. "He accused us of being spies scouting the land.
01Gn 42:31 But we said, 'We are honest men, not spies.
01Gn 42:32 We are twelve brothers, sons of one father. One brother is no longer with us, and the youngest is at home with our father in the land of Canaan.'
01Gn 42:33 "Then the man who is governor of the land told us, 'This is how I will find out if you are honest men. Leave one of your brothers here with me, and take grain for your starving families and go on home.
01Gn 42:34 But you must bring your youngest brother back to me. Then I will know you are honest men and not spies. Then I will give you back your brother, and you may trade freely in the land.'"
01Gn 42:35 As they emptied out their sacks, there in each man's sack was the bag of money he had paid for the grain! The brothers and their father were terrified when they saw the bags of money.
01Gn 42:36 Jacob exclaimed, "You are robbing me of my children! Joseph is gone! Simeon is gone! And now you want to take Benjamin, too. Everything is going against me!"
01Gn 42:37 Then Reuben said to his father, "You may kill my two sons if I don't bring Benjamin back to you. I'll be responsible for him, and I promise to bring him back."
01Gn 42:38 But Jacob replied, "My son will not go down with you. His brother Joseph is dead, and he is all I have left. If anything should happen to him on your journey, you would send this grieving, white-haired man to his grave��." / ��Hebrew to Sheol
01Gn 43:1 But the famine continued to ravage the land of Canaan.
01Gn 43:2 When the grain they had brought from Egypt was almost gone, Jacob said to his sons, "Go back and buy us a little more food."
01Gn 43:3 But Judah said, "The man was serious when he warned us, 'You won't see my face again unless your brother is with you.'
01Gn 43:4 If you send Benjamin with us, we will go down and buy more food.
01Gn 43:5 But if you don't let Benjamin go, we won't go either. Remember, the man said, 'You won't see my face again unless your brother is with you.'"
01Gn 43:6 "Why were you so cruel to me?" Jacob�� moaned. "Why did you tell him you had another brother?" / ��Hebrew Israel; also in 43.11. See note on 35.21
01Gn 43:7 "The man kept asking us questions about our family," they replied. "He asked, 'Is your father still alive? Do you have another brother?' So we answered his questions. How could we know he would say, 'Bring your brother down here'?"
01Gn 43:8 Judah said to his father, "Send the boy with me, and we will be on our way. Otherwise we will all die of starvation - and not only we, but you and our little ones.
01Gn 43:9 I personally guarantee his safety. You may hold me responsible if I don't bring him back to you. Then let me bear the blame forever.
01Gn 43:10 If we hadn't wasted all this time, we could have gone and returned twice by now."
01Gn 43:11 So their father, Jacob, finally said to them, "If it can't be avoided, then at least do this. Pack your bags with the best products of this land. Take them down to the man as gifts - balm, honey, gum, aromatic resin, pistachio nuts, and almonds.
01Gn 43:12 Also take double the money that was put back in your sacks, as it was probably someone's mistake.
01Gn 43:13 Then take your brother, and go back to the man.
01Gn 43:14 May God Almighty�� give you mercy as you go before the man, so that he will release Simeon and let Benjamin return. But if I must lose my children, so be it." / ��Hebrew El-Shaddai
01Gn 43:15 So the men packed Jacob's gifts and double the money and headed off with Benjamin. They finally arrived in Egypt and presented themselves to Joseph.
01Gn 43:16 When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the manager of his household, "These men will eat with me this noon. Take them inside the palace. Then go slaughter an animal, and prepare a big feast."
01Gn 43:17 So the man did as Joseph told him and took them into Joseph's palace.
01Gn 43:18 The brothers were terrified when they saw that they were being taken into Joseph's house. "It's because of the money someone put in our sacks last time we were here," they said. "He plans to pretend that we stole it. Then he will seize us, make us slaves, and take our donkeys."
01Gn 43:19 The brothers approached the manager of Joseph's household and spoke to him at the entrance to the palace.
01Gn 43:20 "Sir," they said, "we came to Egypt once before to buy food.
01Gn 43:21 But as we were returning home, we stopped for the night and opened our sacks. Then we discovered that each man's money - the exact amount paid - was in the top of his sack! Here it is; we have brought it back with us.
01Gn 43:22 We also have additional money to buy more food. We have no idea who put our money in our sacks."
01Gn 43:23 "Relax. Don't be afraid," the household manager told them. "Your God, the God of your father, must have put this treasure into your sacks. I know I received your payment." Then he released Simeon and brought him out to them.
01Gn 43:24 The manager then led the men into Joseph's palace. He gave them water to wash their feet and provided food for their donkeys.
01Gn 43:25 They were told they would be eating there, so they prepared their gifts for Joseph's arrival at noon.
01Gn 43:26 When Joseph came home, they gave him the gifts they had brought him, then bowed low to the ground before him.
01Gn 43:27 After greeting them, he asked, "How is your father, the old man you spoke about? Is he still alive?"
01Gn 43:28 "Yes," they replied. "Our father, your servant, is alive and well." And they bowed low again.
01Gn 43:29 Then Joseph looked at his brother Benjamin, the son of his own mother. "Is this your youngest brother, the one you told me about?" Joseph asked. "May God be gracious to you, my son."
01Gn 43:30 Then Joseph hurried from the room because he was overcome with emotion for his brother. He went into his private room, where he broke down and wept.
01Gn 43:31 After washing his face, he came back out, keeping himself under control. Then he ordered, "Bring out the food!"
01Gn 43:32 The waiters served Joseph at his own table, and his brothers were served at a separate table. The Egyptians who ate with Joseph sat at their own table, because Egyptians despise Hebrews and refuse to eat with them.
01Gn 43:33 Joseph told each of his brothers where to sit, and to their amazement, he seated them according to age, from oldest to youngest.
01Gn 43:34 And Joseph filled their plates with food from his own table, giving Benjamin five times as much as he gave the others. So they feasted and drank freely with him.
01Gn 44:1 When his brothers were ready to leave, Joseph gave these instructions to his palace manager�� "Fill each of their sacks with as much grain as they can carry, and put each man's money back into his sack.
01Gn 44:2 Then put my personal silver cup at the top of the youngest brother's sack, along with the money for his grain." So the manager did as Joseph instructed him.
01Gn 44:3 The brothers were up at dawn and were sent on their journey with their loaded donkeys.
01Gn 44:4 But when they had gone only a short distance and were barely out of the city, Joseph said to his palace manager, "Chase after them and stop them. When you catch up with them, ask them, 'Why have you repaid my kindness with such evil?
01Gn 44:5 Why have you stolen my master's silver cup��, which he uses to predict the future? What a wicked thing you have done!'" / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew lacks this phrase
01Gn 44:6 When the palace manager caught up with the men, he spoke to them as he had been instructed.
01Gn 44:7 "What are you talking about?" the brothers responded. "We are your servants and would never do such a thing!
01Gn 44:8 Didn't we return the money we found in our sacks? We brought it back all the way from the land of Canaan. Why would we steal silver or gold from your master's house?
01Gn 44:9 If you find his cup with any one of us, let that man die. And all the rest of us, my lord, will be your slaves."
01Gn 44:10 "That's fair," the man replied. "But only the one who stole the cup will be my slave. The rest of you may go free."
01Gn 44:11 They all quickly took their sacks from the backs of their donkeys and opened them.
01Gn 44:12 The palace manager searched the brothers' sacks, from the oldest to the youngest. And the cup was found in Benjamin's sack!
01Gn 44:13 When the brothers saw this, they tore their clothing in despair. Then they loaded their donkeys again and returned to the city.
01Gn 44:14 Joseph was still in his palace when Judah and his brothers arrived, and they fell to the ground before him.
01Gn 44:15 "What have you done?" Joseph demanded. "Don't you know that a man like me can predict the future?"
01Gn 44:16 Judah answered, "Oh, my lord, what can we say to you? How can we explain this? How can we prove our innocence? God is punishing us for our sins. My lord, we have all returned to be your slaves - all of us, not just our brother who had your cup in his sack."
01Gn 44:17 "No," Joseph said. "I would never do such a thing! Only the man who stole the cup will be my slave. The rest of you may go back to your father in peace."
01Gn 44:18 Then Judah stepped forward and said, "Please, my lord, let your servant say just one word to you. Please, do not be angry with me, even though you are as powerful as Pharaoh himself.
01Gn 44:19 "My lord, previously you asked us, your servants, 'Do you have a father or a brother?'
01Gn 44:20 And we responded, 'Yes, my lord, we have a father who is an old man, and his youngest son is a child of his old age. His full brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother's children, and his father loves him very much.'
01Gn 44:21 "And you said to us, 'Bring him here so I can see him with my own eyes.'
01Gn 44:22 But we said to you, 'My lord, the boy cannot leave his father, for his father would die.'
01Gn 44:23 But you told us, 'Unless your youngest brother comes with you, you will never see my face again.'
01Gn 44:24 "So we returned to your servant, our father, and told him what you had said.
01Gn 44:25 Later, when he said, 'Go back again and buy us more food,'
01Gn 44:26 we replied, 'We can't go unless you let our youngest brother go with us. We'll never get to see the man's face unless our youngest brother is with us.'
01Gn 44:27 "Then my father said to us, 'As you know, my wife had two sons,
01Gn 44:28 and one of them went away and never returned. Doubtless he was torn to pieces by some wild animal. I have never seen him since.
01Gn 44:29 Now if you take his brother away from me, and any harm comes to him, you will send this grieving, white-haired man to his grave��.' / ��Hebrew to Sheol; also in 44.31
01Gn 44:30 "And now, my lord, I cannot go back to my father without the boy. Our father's life is bound up in the boy's life.
01Gn 44:31 If he sees that the boy is not with us, our father will die. We, your servants, will indeed be responsible for sending that grieving, white-haired man to his grave.
01Gn 44:32 My lord, I guaranteed to my father that I would take care of the boy. I told him, 'If I don't bring him back to you, I will bear the blame forever.'
01Gn 44:33 "So please, my lord, let me stay here as a slave instead of the boy, and let the boy return with his brothers.
01Gn 44:34 For how can I return to my father if the boy is not with me? I couldn't bear to see the anguish this would cause my father!"
01Gn 45:1 Joseph could stand it no longer. There were many people in the room, and he said to his attendants, "Out, all of you!" So he was alone with his brothers when he told them who he was.
01Gn 45:2 Then he broke down and wept. He wept so loudly the Egyptians could hear him, and word of it quickly carried to Pharaoh's palace.
01Gn 45:3 "I am Joseph!" he said to his brothers. "Is my father still alive?" But his brothers were speechless! They were stunned to realize that Joseph was standing there in front of them.
01Gn 45:4 "Please, come closer," he said to them. So they came closer. And he said again, "I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into slavery in Egypt.
01Gn 45:5 But don't be upset, and don't be angry with yourselves for selling me to this place. It was God who sent me here ahead of you to preserve your lives.
01Gn 45:6 This famine that has ravaged the land for two years will last five more years, and there will be neither plowing nor harvesting.
01Gn 45:7 God has sent me ahead of you to keep you and your families alive and to preserve many survivors��. / ��Or and to save you with an extraordinary rescue. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
01Gn 45:8 So it was God who sent me here, not you! And he is the one who made me an adviser�� to Pharaoh - the manager of his entire palace and the governor of all Egypt. / ��Hebrew a father
01Gn 45:9 "Now hurry back to my father and tell him, 'This is what your son Joseph says�� God has made me master over all the land of Egypt. So come down to me immediately!
01Gn 45:10 You can live in the region of Goshen, where you can be near me with all your children and grandchildren, your flocks and herds, and everything you own.
01Gn 45:11 I will take care of you there, for there are still five years of famine ahead of us. Otherwise you, your household, and all your animals will starve.'"
01Gn 45:12 Then Joseph added, "Look! You can see for yourselves, and so can my brother Benjamin, that I really am Joseph!
01Gn 45:13 Go tell my father of my honored position here in Egypt. Describe for him everything you have seen, and then bring my father here quickly."
01Gn 45:14 Weeping with joy, he embraced Benjamin, and Benjamin did the same.
01Gn 45:15 Then Joseph kissed each of his brothers and wept over them, and after that they began talking freely with him.
01Gn 45:16 The news soon reached Pharaoh's palace�� "Joseph's brothers have arrived!" Pharaoh and his officials were all delighted to hear this.
01Gn 45:17 Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'This is what you must do�� Load your pack animals, and hurry back to the land of Canaan.
01Gn 45:18 Then get your father and all of your families, and return here to me. I will give you the very best land in Egypt, and you will eat from the best that the land produces.'"
01Gn 45:19 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Tell your brothers, 'Take wagons from the land of Egypt to carry your little children and your wives, and bring your father here.
01Gn 45:20 Don't worry about your personal belongings, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.'"
01Gn 45:21 So the sons of Jacob�� did as they were told. Joseph provided them with wagons, as Pharaoh had commanded, and he gave them supplies for the journey. / ��Hebrew Israel; also in 45.28. See note on 35.21
01Gn 45:22 And he gave each of them new clothes - but to Benjamin he gave five changes of clothes and 300 pieces�� of silver. / ��Hebrew 300 shekels, about 7.5 pounds or 3.4 kilograms in weight
01Gn 45:23 He also sent his father ten male donkeys loaded with the finest products of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and other supplies he would need on his journey.
01Gn 45:24 So Joseph sent his brothers off, and as they left, he called after them, "Don't quarrel about all this along the way!"
01Gn 45:25 And they left Egypt and returned to their father, Jacob, in the land of Canaan.
01Gn 45:26 "Joseph is still alive!" they told him. "And he is governor of all the land of Egypt!" Jacob was stunned at the news - he couldn't believe it.
01Gn 45:27 But when they repeated to Jacob everything Joseph had told them, and when he saw the wagons Joseph had sent to carry him, their father's spirits revived.
01Gn 45:28 Then Jacob exclaimed, "It must be true! My son Joseph is alive! I must go and see him before I die."
01Gn 46:1 So Jacob�� set out for Egypt with all his possessions. And when he came to Beersheba, he offered sacrifices to the God of his father, Isaac. / ��Hebrew Israel; also in 46.29, 30. See note on 35.21
01Gn 46:2 During the night God spoke to him in a vision. "Jacob! Jacob!" he called."Here I am," Jacob replied.
01Gn 46:3 "I am God��, the God of your father," the voice said. "Do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for there I will make your family into a great nation. / ��Hebrew I am El
01Gn 46:4 I will go with you down to Egypt, and I will bring you back again. You will die in Egypt, but Joseph will be with you to close your eyes."
01Gn 46:5 So Jacob left Beersheba, and his sons took him to Egypt. They carried him and their little ones and their wives in the wagons Pharaoh had provided for them.
01Gn 46:6 They also took all their livestock and all the personal belongings they had acquired in the land of Canaan. So Jacob and his entire family went to Egypt - 
01Gn 46:7 sons and grandsons, daughters and granddaughters - all his descendants.
01Gn 46:8 These are the names of the descendants of Israel - the sons of Jacob - who went to Egypt�� Reuben was Jacob's oldest son.
01Gn 46:9 The sons of Reuben were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.
01Gn 46:10 The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul. (Shaul's mother was a Canaanite woman.)
01Gn 46:11 The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
01Gn 46:12 The sons of Judah were Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah (though Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan). The sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul.
01Gn 46:13 The sons of Issachar were Tola, Puah��, Jashub��, and Shimron. / ��As in Syriac version and Samaritan Pentateuch (see also 1 Chr 7.1); Hebrew reads Puvah ��As in some Greek manuscripts and Samaritan Pentateuch (see also Num 26.24; 1 Chr 7.1); Hebrew reads Iob
01Gn 46:14 The sons of Zebulun were Sered, Elon, and Jahleel.
01Gn 46:15 These were the sons of Leah and Jacob who were born in Paddan-aram, in addition to their daughter, Dinah. The number of Jacob's descendants (male and female) through Leah was thirty-three.
01Gn 46:16 The sons of Gad were Zephon��, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. / ��As in Greek version and Samaritan Pentateuch (see also Num 26.15); Hebrew reads Ziphion
01Gn 46:17 The sons of Asher were Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, and Beriah. Their sister was Serah. Beriah's sons were Heber and Malkiel.
01Gn 46:18 These were the sons of Zilpah, the servant given to Leah by her father, Laban. The number of Jacob's descendants through Zilpah was sixteen.
01Gn 46:19 The sons of Jacob's wife Rachel were Joseph and Benjamin.
01Gn 46:20 Joseph's sons, born in the land of Egypt, were Manasseh and Ephraim. Their mother was Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On��. / ��Greek version reads of Heliopolis
01Gn 46:21 Benjamin's sons were Bela, Beker, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard.
01Gn 46:22 These were the sons of Rachel and Jacob. The number of Jacob's descendants through Rachel was fourteen.
01Gn 46:23 The son of Dan was Hushim.
01Gn 46:24 The sons of Naphtali were Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem.
01Gn 46:25 These were the sons of Bilhah, the servant given to Rachel by her father, Laban. The number of Jacob's descendants through Bilhah was seven.
01Gn 46:26 The total number of Jacob's direct descendants who went with him to Egypt, not counting his sons' wives, was sixty-six.
01Gn 46:27 In addition, Joseph had two sons�� who were born in Egypt. So altogether, there were seventy�� members of Jacob's family in the land of Egypt. / ��Greek version reads nine sons, probably including Joseph's grandsons through Ephraim and Manasseh (see 1 Chr 7.14-20) ��Greek version reads seventy-five; see note on Exod 1.5
01Gn 46:28 As they neared their destination, Jacob sent Judah ahead to meet Joseph and get directions to the region of Goshen. And when they finally arrived there,
01Gn 46:29 Joseph prepared his chariot and traveled to Goshen to meet his father, Jacob. When Joseph arrived, he embraced his father and wept, holding him for a long time.
01Gn 46:30 Finally, Jacob said to Joseph, "Now I am ready to die, since I have seen your face again and know you are still alive."
01Gn 46:31 And Joseph said to his brothers and to his father's entire family, "I will go to Pharaoh and tell him, 'My brothers and my father's entire family have come to me from the land of Canaan.
01Gn 46:32 These men are shepherds, and they raise livestock. They have brought with them their flocks and herds and everything they own.'"
01Gn 46:33 Then he said, "When Pharaoh calls for you and asks you about your occupation,
01Gn 46:34 you must tell him, 'We, your servants, have raised livestock all our lives, as our ancestors have always done.' When you tell him this, he will let you live here in the region of Goshen, for the Egyptians despise shepherds."
01Gn 47:1 Then Joseph went to see Pharaoh and told him, "My father and my brothers have arrived from the land of Canaan. They have come with all their flocks and herds and possessions, and they are now in the region of Goshen."
01Gn 47:2 Joseph took five of his brothers with him and presented them to Pharaoh.
01Gn 47:3 And Pharaoh asked the brothers, "What is your occupation?" They replied, "We, your servants, are shepherds, just like our ancestors.
01Gn 47:4 We have come to live here in Egypt for a while, for there is no pasture for our flocks in Canaan. The famine is very severe there. So please, we request permission to live in the region of Goshen."
01Gn 47:5 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, "Now that your father and brothers have joined you here,
01Gn 47:6 choose any place in the entire land of Egypt for them to live. Give them the best land of Egypt. Let them live in the region of Goshen. And if any of them have special skills, put them in charge of my livestock, too."
01Gn 47:7 Then Joseph brought in his father, Jacob, and presented him to Pharaoh. And Jacob blessed Pharaoh.
01Gn 47:8 "How old are you?" Pharaoh asked him.
01Gn 47:9 Jacob replied, "I have traveled this earth for 130 hard years. But my life has been short compared to the lives of my ancestors."
01Gn 47:10 Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh again before leaving his court.
01Gn 47:11 So Joseph assigned the best land of Egypt - the region of Rameses - to his father and his brothers, and he settled them there, just as Pharaoh had commanded.
01Gn 47:12 And Joseph provided food for his father and his brothers in amounts appropriate to the number of their dependents, including the smallest children.
01Gn 47:13 Meanwhile, the famine became so severe that all the food was used up, and people were starving throughout the lands of Egypt and Canaan.
01Gn 47:14 By selling grain to the people, Joseph eventually collected all the money in Egypt and Canaan, and he put the money in Pharaoh's treasury.
01Gn 47:15 When the people of Egypt and Canaan ran out of money, all the Egyptians came to Joseph. "Our money is gone!" they cried. "But please give us food, or we will die before your very eyes!"
01Gn 47:16 Joseph replied, "Since your money is gone, bring me your livestock. I will give you food in exchange for your livestock."
01Gn 47:17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph in exchange for food. In exchange for their horses, flocks of sheep and goats, herds of cattle, and donkeys, Joseph provided them with food for another year.
01Gn 47:18 But that year ended, and the next year they came again and said, "We cannot hide the truth from you, my lord. Our money is gone, and all our livestock and cattle are yours. We have nothing left to give but our bodies and our land.
01Gn 47:19 Why should we die before your very eyes? Buy us and our land in exchange for food; we offer our land and ourselves as slaves for Pharaoh. Just give us grain so we may live and not die, and so the land does not become empty and desolate."
01Gn 47:20 So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh. All the Egyptians sold him their fields because the famine was so severe, and soon all the land belonged to Pharaoh.
01Gn 47:21 As for the people, he made them all slaves��, from one end of Egypt to the other. / ��As in Greek version and Samaritan Pentateuch; Hebrew reads he moved them all into the towns
01Gn 47:22 The only land he did not buy was the land belonging to the priests. They received an allotment of food directly from Pharaoh, so they didn't need to sell their land.
01Gn 47:23 Then Joseph said to the people, "Look, today I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh. I will provide you with seed so you can plant the fields.
01Gn 47:24 Then when you harvest it, one-fifth of your crop will belong to Pharaoh. You may keep the remaining four-fifths as seed for your fields and as food for you, your households, and your little ones."
01Gn 47:25 "You have saved our lives!" they exclaimed. "May it please you, my lord, to let us be Pharaoh's servants."
01Gn 47:26 Joseph then issued a decree still in effect in the land of Egypt, that Pharaoh should receive one-fifth of all the crops grown on his land. Only the land belonging to the priests was not given to Pharaoh.
01Gn 47:27 Meanwhile, the people of Israel settled in the region of Goshen in Egypt. There they acquired property, and they were fruitful, and their population grew rapidly.
01Gn 47:28 Jacob lived for seventeen years after his arrival in Egypt, so he lived 147 years in all.
01Gn 47:29 As the time of his death drew near, Jacob�� called for his son Joseph and said to him, "Please do me this favor. Put your hand under my thigh and swear that you will treat me with unfailing love by honoring this last request�� Do not bury me in Egypt. / ��Hebrew Israel; also in 47.31b. See note on 35.21
01Gn 47:30 When I die, please take my body out of Egypt and bury me with my ancestors." So Joseph promised, "I will do as you ask."
01Gn 47:31 "Swear that you will do it," Jacob insisted. So Joseph gave his oath, and Jacob bowed humbly at the head of his bed��. / ��Greek version reads and Israel bowed in worship as he leaned on his staff. Compare Heb 11.21
01Gn 48:1 One day not long after this, word came to Joseph, "Your father is failing rapidly." So Joseph went to visit his father, and he took with him his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
01Gn 48:2 When Joseph arrived, Jacob was told, "Your son Joseph has come to see you." So Jacob�� gathered his strength and sat up in his bed. / ��Hebrew Israel; also in 48.8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 21. See note on 35.21
01Gn 48:3 Jacob said to Joseph, "God Almighty�� appeared to me at Luz in the land of Canaan and blessed me. / ��Hebrew El-Shaddai
01Gn 48:4 He said to me, 'I will make you fruitful, and I will multiply your descendants. I will make you a multitude of nations. And I will give this land of Canaan to your descendants�� after you as an everlasting possession.' / ��Hebrew seed; also in 48.19
01Gn 48:5 "Now I am claiming as my own sons these two boys of yours, Ephraim and Manasseh, who were born here in the land of Egypt before I arrived. They will be my sons, just as Reuben and Simeon are.
01Gn 48:6 But any children born to you in the future will be your own, and they will inherit land within the territories of their brothers Ephraim and Manasseh.
01Gn 48:7 "Long ago, as I was returning from Paddan-aram, Rachel died in the land of Canaan. We were still on the way, some distance from Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). So with great sorrow I buried her there beside the road to Ephrath."
01Gn 48:8 Then Jacob looked over at the two boys. "Are these your sons?" he asked.
01Gn 48:9 "Yes," Joseph told him, "these are the sons God has given me here in Egypt." And Jacob said, "Bring them closer to me, so I can bless them."
01Gn 48:10 Jacob was half blind because of his age and could hardly see. So Joseph brought the boys close to him, and Jacob kissed and embraced them.
01Gn 48:11 Then Jacob said to Joseph, "I never thought I would see your face again, but now God has let me see your children, too!"
01Gn 48:12 Joseph moved the boys, who were at their grandfather's knees, and he bowed with his face to the ground.
01Gn 48:13 Then he positioned the boys in front of Jacob. With his right hand he directed Ephraim toward Jacob's left hand, and with his left hand he put Manasseh at Jacob's right hand.
01Gn 48:14 But Jacob crossed his arms as he reached out to lay his hands on the boys' heads. He put his right hand on the head of Ephraim, though he was the younger boy, and his left hand on the head of Manasseh, though he was the firstborn.
01Gn 48:15 Then he blessed Joseph and said, "May the God before whom my grandfather Abraham and my father, Isaac, walked - the God who has been my shepherd all my life, to this very day,
01Gn 48:16 the Angel who has redeemed me from all harm - may he bless these boys. May they preserve my name and the names of Abraham and Isaac. And may their descendants multiply greatly throughout the earth."
01Gn 48:17 But Joseph was upset when he saw that his father placed his right hand on Ephraim's head. So Joseph lifted it to move it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
01Gn 48:18 "No, my father," he said. "This one is the firstborn. Put your right hand on his head."
01Gn 48:19 But his father refused. "I know, my son; I know," he replied. "Manasseh will also become a great people, but his younger brother will become even greater. And his descendants will become a multitude of nations."
01Gn 48:20 So Jacob blessed the boys that day with this blessing�� "The people of Israel will use your names when they give a blessing. They will say, 'May God make you as prosperous as Ephraim and Manasseh.'" In this way, Jacob put Ephraim ahead of Manasseh.
01Gn 48:21 Then Jacob said to Joseph, "Look, I am about to die, but God will be with you and will take you back to Canaan, the land of your ancestors.
01Gn 48:22 And beyond what I have given your brothers, I am giving you an extra portion of the land�� that I took from the Amorites with my sword and bow." / ��Or an extra ridge of land. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
01Gn 49:1 Then Jacob called together all his sons and said, "Gather around me, and I will tell you what will happen to each of you in the days to come.

01Gn 49:29 Then Jacob instructed them, "Soon I will die and join my ancestors. Bury me with my father and grandfather in the cave in the field of Ephron the Hittite.
01Gn 49:30 This is the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre in Canaan, that Abraham bought from Ephron the Hittite as a permanent burial site.
01Gn 49:31 There Abraham and his wife Sarah are buried. There Isaac and his wife, Rebekah, are buried. And there I buried Leah.
01Gn 49:32 It is the plot of land and the cave that my grandfather Abraham bought from the Hittites."
01Gn 49:33 When Jacob had finished this charge to his sons, he drew his feet into the bed, breathed his last, and joined his ancestors in death.
01Gn 50:1 Joseph threw himself on his father and wept over him and kissed him.
01Gn 50:2 Then Joseph told the physicians who served him to embalm his father's body; so Jacob�� was embalmed. / ��Hebrew Israel. See note on 35.21
01Gn 50:3 The embalming process took the usual forty days. And the Egyptians mourned his death for seventy days.
01Gn 50:4 When the period of mourning was over, Joseph approached Pharaoh's advisers and said, "Please do me this favor and speak to Pharaoh on my behalf.
01Gn 50:5 Tell him that my father made me swear an oath. He said to me, 'Listen, I am about to die. Take my body back to the land of Canaan, and bury me in the tomb I prepared for myself.' So please allow me to go and bury my father. After his burial, I will return without delay."
01Gn 50:6 Pharaoh agreed to Joseph's request. "Go and bury your father, as he made you promise," he said.
01Gn 50:7 So Joseph went up to bury his father. He was accompanied by all of Pharaoh's officials, all the senior members of Pharaoh's household, and all the senior officers of Egypt.
01Gn 50:8 Joseph also took his entire household and his brothers and their households. But they left their little children and flocks and herds in the land of Goshen.
01Gn 50:9 A great number of chariots and charioteers accompanied Joseph.
01Gn 50:10 When they arrived at the threshing floor of Atad, near the Jordan River, they held a very great and solemn memorial service, with a seven-day period of mourning for Joseph's father.
01Gn 50:11 The local residents, the Canaanites, watched them mourning at the threshing floor of Atad. Then they renamed that place (which is near the Jordan) Abel-mizraim��, for they said, "This is a place of deep mourning for these Egyptians." / ��Abel-mizraim means "mourning of the Egyptians"
01Gn 50:12 So Jacob's sons did as he had commanded them.
01Gn 50:13 They carried his body to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave in the field of Machpelah, near Mamre. This is the cave that Abraham had bought as a permanent burial site from Ephron the Hittite.
01Gn 50:14 After burying Jacob, Joseph returned to Egypt with his brothers and all who had accompanied him to his father's burial.
01Gn 50:15 But now that their father was dead, Joseph's brothers became fearful. "Now Joseph will show his anger and pay us back for all the wrong we did to him," they said.
01Gn 50:16 So they sent this message to Joseph�� "Before your father died, he instructed us
01Gn 50:17 to say to you�� 'Please forgive your brothers for the great wrong they did to you - for their sin in treating you so cruelly.' So we, the servants of the God of your father, beg you to forgive our sin." When Joseph received the message, he broke down and wept.
01Gn 50:18 Then his brothers came and threw themselves down before Joseph. "Look, we are your slaves!" they said.
01Gn 50:19 But Joseph replied, "Don't be afraid of me. Am I God, that I can punish you?
01Gn 50:20 You intended to harm me, but God intended it all for good. He brought me to this position so I could save the lives of many people.
01Gn 50:21 No, don't be afraid. I will continue to take care of you and your children." So he reassured them by speaking kindly to them.
01Gn 50:22 So Joseph and his brothers and their families continued to live in Egypt. Joseph lived to the age of 110.
01Gn 50:23 He lived to see three generations of descendants of his son Ephraim, and he lived to see the birth of the children of Manasseh's son Makir, whom he claimed as his own��. / ��Hebrew who were born on Joseph's knees
01Gn 50:24 "Soon I will die," Joseph told his brothers, "but God will surely come to help you and lead you out of this land of Egypt. He will bring you back to the land he solemnly promised to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob."
01Gn 50:25 Then Joseph made the sons of Israel swear an oath, and he said, "When God comes to help you and lead you back, you must take my bones with you."
01Gn 50:26 So Joseph died at the age of 110. The Egyptians embalmed him, and his body was placed in a coffin in Egypt.

02Ex 1:1 These are the names of the sons of Israel (that is, Jacob) who moved to Egypt with their father, each with his family.
02Ex 1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah,
02Ex 1:3 Issachar, Zebulun, Benjamin,
02Ex 1:4 Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher.
02Ex 1:5 In all, Jacob had seventy�� descendants in Egypt, including Joseph, who was already there. / ��Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version read seventy-five; see notes on Gen 46.27
02Ex 1:6 In time, Joseph and all of his brothers died, ending that entire generation.
02Ex 1:7 But their descendants, the Israelites, had many children and grandchildren. In fact, they multiplied so greatly that they became extremely powerful and filled the land.
02Ex 1:8 Eventually, a new king came to power in Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph or what he had done.
02Ex 1:9 He said to his people, "Look, the people of Israel now outnumber us and are stronger than we are.
02Ex 1:10 We must make a plan to keep them from growing even more. If we don't, and if war breaks out, they will join our enemies and fight against us. Then they will escape from the country��." / ��Or will take the country
02Ex 1:11 So the Egyptians made the Israelites their slaves. They appointed brutal slave drivers over them, hoping to wear them down with crushing labor. They forced them to build the cities of Pithom and Rameses as supply centers for the king.
02Ex 1:12 But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more the Israelites multiplied and spread, and the more alarmed the Egyptians became.
02Ex 1:13 So the Egyptians worked the people of Israel without mercy.
02Ex 1:14 They made their lives bitter, forcing them to mix mortar and make bricks and do all the work in the fields. They were ruthless in all their demands.
02Ex 1:15 Then Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, gave this order to the Hebrew midwives, Shiphrah and Puah.
02Ex 1:16 "When you help the Hebrew women as they give birth, watch as they deliver��. If the baby is a boy, kill him; if it is a girl, let her live." / ��Hebrew look upon the two stones; perhaps the reference is to a birthstool
02Ex 1:17 But because the midwives feared God, they refused to obey the king's orders. They allowed the boys to live, too.
02Ex 1:18 So the king of Egypt called for the midwives. "Why have you done this?" he demanded. "Why have you allowed the boys to live?"
02Ex 1:19 "The Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women," the midwives replied. "They are more vigorous and have their babies so quickly that we cannot get there in time."
02Ex 1:20 So God was good to the midwives, and the Israelites continued to multiply, growing more and more powerful.
02Ex 1:21 And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own.
02Ex 1:22 Then Pharaoh gave this order to all his people�� "Throw every newborn Hebrew boy into the Nile River. But you may let the girls live."
02Ex 2:1 About this time, a man and woman from the tribe of Levi got married.
02Ex 2:2 The woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She saw that he was a special baby and kept him hidden for three months.
02Ex 2:3 But when she could no longer hide him, she got a basket made of papyrus reeds and waterproofed it with tar and pitch. She put the baby in the basket and laid it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile River.
02Ex 2:4 The baby's sister then stood at a distance, watching to see what would happen to him.
02Ex 2:5 Soon Pharaoh's daughter came down to bathe in the river, and her attendants walked along the riverbank. When the princess saw the basket among the reeds, she sent her maid to get it for her.
02Ex 2:6 When the princess opened it, she saw the baby. The little boy was crying, and she felt sorry for him. "This must be one of the Hebrew children," she said.
02Ex 2:7 Then the baby's sister approached the princess. "Should I go and find one of the Hebrew women to nurse the baby for you?" she asked.
02Ex 2:8 "Yes, do!" the princess replied. So the girl went and called the baby's mother.
02Ex 2:9 "Take this baby and nurse him for me," the princess told the baby's mother. "I will pay you for your help." So the woman took her baby home and nursed him.
02Ex 2:10 Later, when the boy was older, his mother brought him back to Pharaoh's daughter, who adopted him as her own son. The princess named him Moses��, for she explained, "I lifted him out of the water." / ��Moses sounds like a Hebrew term that means "to lift out"
02Ex 2:11 Many years later, when Moses had grown up, he went out to visit his own people, the Hebrews, and he saw how hard they were forced to work. During his visit, he saw an Egyptian beating one of his fellow Hebrews.
02Ex 2:12 After looking in all directions to make sure no one was watching, Moses killed the Egyptian and hid the body in the sand.
02Ex 2:13 The next day, when Moses went out to visit his people again, he saw two Hebrew men fighting. "Why are you beating up your friend?" Moses said to the one who had started the fight.
02Ex 2:14 The man replied, "Who appointed you to be our prince and judge? Are you going to kill me as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?" Then Moses was afraid, thinking, "Everyone knows what I did."
02Ex 2:15 And sure enough, Pharaoh heard what had happened, and he tried to kill Moses. But Moses fled from Pharaoh and went to live in the land of Midian. When Moses arrived in Midian, he sat down beside a well.
02Ex 2:16 Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters who came as usual to draw water and fill the water troughs for their father's flocks.
02Ex 2:17 But some other shepherds came and chased them away. So Moses jumped up and rescued the girls from the shepherds. Then he drew water for their flocks.
02Ex 2:18 When the girls returned to Reuel, their father, he asked, "Why are you back so soon today?"
02Ex 2:19 "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds," they answered. "And then he drew water for us and watered our flocks."
02Ex 2:20 "Then where is he?" their father asked. "Why did you leave him there? Invite him to come and eat with us."
02Ex 2:21 Moses accepted the invitation, and he settled there with him. In time, Reuel gave Moses his daughter Zipporah to be his wife.
02Ex 2:22 Later she gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom��, for he explained, "I have been a foreigner in a foreign land." / ��Gershom sounds like a Hebrew term that means "a foreigner there"
02Ex 2:23 Years passed, and the king of Egypt died. But the Israelites continued to groan under their burden of slavery. They cried out for help, and their cry rose up to God.
02Ex 2:24 God heard their groaning, and he remembered his covenant promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
02Ex 2:25 He looked down on the people of Israel and knew it was time to act��. / ��Or and acknowledged his obligation to help them
02Ex 3:1 One day Moses was tending the flock of his father-in-law, Jethro��, the priest of Midian. He led the flock far into the wilderness and came to Sinai��, the mountain of God. / ��Moses' father-in-law went by two names, Jethro and Reuel ��Hebrew Horeb, another name for Sinai
02Ex 3:2 There the angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing fire from the middle of a bush. Moses stared in amazement. Though the bush was engulfed in flames, it didn't burn up.
02Ex 3:3 "This is amazing," Moses said to himself. "Why isn't that bush burning up? I must go see it."
02Ex 3:4 When the LORD saw Moses coming to take a closer look, God called to him from the middle of the bush, "Moses! Moses!" "Here I am!" Moses replied.
02Ex 3:5 "Do not come any closer," the LORD warned. "Take off your sandals, for you are standing on holy ground.
02Ex 3:6 I am the God of your father�� - the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." When Moses heard this, he covered his face because he was afraid to look at God. / ��Greek version reads your fathers
02Ex 3:7 Then the LORD told him, "I have certainly seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their cries of distress because of their harsh slave drivers. Yes, I am aware of their suffering.
02Ex 3:8 So I have come down to rescue them from the power of the Egyptians and lead them out of Egypt into their own fertile and spacious land. It is a land flowing with milk and honey - the land where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites now live.
02Ex 3:9 Look! The cry of the people of Israel has reached me, and I have seen how harshly the Egyptians abuse them.
02Ex 3:10 Now go, for I am sending you to Pharaoh. You must lead my people Israel out of Egypt."
02Ex 3:11 But Moses protested to God, "Who am I to appear before Pharaoh? Who am I to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt?"
02Ex 3:12 God answered, "I will be with you. And this is your sign that I am the one who has sent you�� When you have brought the people out of Egypt, you will worship God at this very mountain."
02Ex 3:13 But Moses protested, "If I go to the people of Israel and tell them, 'The God of your ancestors has sent me to you,' they will ask me, 'What is his name?' Then what should I tell them?"
02Ex 3:14 God replied to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM��. Say this to the people of Israel�� I AM has sent me to you." / ��Or I WILL BE WHAT I WILL BE
02Ex 3:15 God also said to Moses, "Say this to the people of Israel�� Yahweh��, the God of your ancestors - the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob - has sent me to you. This is my eternal name, my name to remember for all generations. / ��Yahweh is a transliteration of the proper name YHWH that is sometimes rendered "Jehovah"; in this translation it is usually rendered "the LORD" (note the use of small capitals)
02Ex 3:16 "Now go and call together all the elders of Israel. Tell them, 'The LORD, the God of your ancestors - the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - has appeared to me. He told me, "I have been watching closely, and I see how the Egyptians are treating you.
02Ex 3:17 I have promised to rescue you from your oppression in Egypt. I will lead you to a land flowing with milk and honey - the land where the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites now live."'
02Ex 3:18 "The elders of Israel will accept your message. Then you and the elders must go to the king of Egypt and tell him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. So please let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD, our God.'
02Ex 3:19 "But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless a mighty hand forces him��. / ��As in Greek and Latin versions; Hebrew reads will not let you go, not by a mighty hand
02Ex 3:20 So I will raise my hand and strike the Egyptians, performing all kinds of miracles among them. Then at last he will let you go.
02Ex 3:21 And I will cause the Egyptians to look favorably on you. They will give you gifts when you go so you will not leave empty-handed.
02Ex 3:22 Every Israelite woman will ask for articles of silver and gold and fine clothing from her Egyptian neighbors and from the foreign women in their houses. You will dress your sons and daughters with these, stripping the Egyptians of their wealth."
02Ex 4:1 But Moses protested again, "What if they won't believe me or listen to me? What if they say, 'The LORD never appeared to you'?"
02Ex 4:2 Then the LORD asked him, "What is that in your hand?" "A shepherd's staff," Moses replied.
02Ex 4:3 "Throw it down on the ground," the LORD told him. So Moses threw down the staff, and it turned into a snake! Moses jumped back.
02Ex 4:4 Then the LORD told him, "Reach out and grab its tail." So Moses reached out and grabbed it, and it turned back into a shepherd's staff in his hand.
02Ex 4:5 "Perform this sign," the LORD told him. "Then they will believe that the LORD, the God of their ancestors - the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob - really has appeared to you."
02Ex 4:6 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now put your hand inside your cloak." So Moses put his hand inside his cloak, and when he took it out again, his hand was white as snow with a severe skin disease��. / ��Or with leprosy. The Hebrew word used here can describe various skin diseases
02Ex 4:7 "Now put your hand back into your cloak," the LORD said. So Moses put his hand back in, and when he took it out again, it was as healthy as the rest of his body.
02Ex 4:8 The LORD said to Moses, "If they do not believe you and are not convinced by the first miraculous sign, they will be convinced by the second sign.
02Ex 4:9 And if they don't believe you or listen to you even after these two signs, then take some water from the Nile River and pour it out on the dry ground. When you do, the water from the Nile will turn to blood on the ground."
02Ex 4:10 But Moses pleaded with the LORD, "O Lord, I'm not very good with words. I never have been, and I'm not now, even though you have spoken to me. I get tongue-tied, and my words get tangled."
02Ex 4:11 Then the LORD asked Moses, "Who makes a person's mouth? Who decides whether people speak or do not speak, hear or do not hear, see or do not see? Is it not I, the LORD?
02Ex 4:12 Now go! I will be with you as you speak, and I will instruct you in what to say."
02Ex 4:13 But Moses again pleaded, "Lord, please! Send anyone else."
02Ex 4:14 Then the LORD became angry with Moses. "All right," he said. "What about your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know he speaks well. And look! He is on his way to meet you now. He will be delighted to see you.
02Ex 4:15 Talk to him, and put the words in his mouth. I will be with both of you as you speak, and I will instruct you both in what to do.
02Ex 4:16 Aaron will be your spokesman to the people. He will be your mouthpiece, and you will stand in the place of God for him, telling him what to say.
02Ex 4:17 And take your shepherd's staff with you, and use it to perform the miraculous signs I have shown you."
02Ex 4:18 So Moses went back home to Jethro, his father-in-law. "Please let me return to my relatives in Egypt," Moses said. "I don't even know if they are still alive." "Go in peace," Jethro replied.
02Ex 4:19 Before Moses left Midian, the LORD said to him, "Return to Egypt, for all those who wanted to kill you have died."
02Ex 4:20 So Moses took his wife and sons, put them on a donkey, and headed back to the land of Egypt. In his hand he carried the staff of God.
02Ex 4:21 And the LORD told Moses, "When you arrive back in Egypt, go to Pharaoh and perform all the miracles I have empowered you to do. But I will harden his heart so he will refuse to let the people go.
02Ex 4:22 Then you will tell him, 'This is what the LORD says�� Israel is my firstborn son.
02Ex 4:23 I commanded you, "Let my son go, so he can worship me." But since you have refused, I will now kill your firstborn son!'"
02Ex 4:24 On the way to Egypt, at a place where Moses and his family had stopped for the night, the LORD confronted him and was about to kill him.
02Ex 4:25 But Moses' wife, Zipporah, took a flint knife and circumcised her son. She touched his feet�� with the foreskin and said, "Now you are a bridegroom of blood to me." / ��The Hebrew word for "feet" may refer here to the male sex organ
02Ex 4:26 (When she said "a bridegroom of blood," she was referring to the circumcision.) After that, the LORD left him alone.
02Ex 4:27 Now the LORD had said to Aaron, "Go out into the wilderness to meet Moses." So Aaron went and met Moses at the mountain of God, and he embraced him.
02Ex 4:28 Moses then told Aaron everything the LORD had commanded him to say. And he told him about the miraculous signs the LORD had commanded him to perform.
02Ex 4:29 Then Moses and Aaron returned to Egypt and called all the elders of Israel together.
02Ex 4:30 Aaron told them everything the LORD had told Moses, and Moses performed the miraculous signs as they watched.
02Ex 4:31 Then the people of Israel were convinced that the LORD had sent Moses and Aaron. When they heard that the LORD was concerned about them and had seen their misery, they bowed down and worshiped.
02Ex 5:1 After this presentation to Israel's leaders, Moses and Aaron went and spoke to Pharaoh. They told him, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says�� Let my people go so they may hold a festival in my honor in the wilderness."
02Ex 5:2 "Is that so?" retorted Pharaoh. "And who is the LORD? Why should I listen to him and let Israel go? I don't know the LORD, and I will not let Israel go."
02Ex 5:3 But Aaron and Moses persisted. "The God of the Hebrews has met with us," they declared. "So let us take a three-day journey into the wilderness so we can offer sacrifices to the LORD our God. If we don't, he will kill us with a plague or with the sword."
02Ex 5:4 Pharaoh replied, "Moses and Aaron, why are you distracting the people from their tasks? Get back to work!
02Ex 5:5 Look, there are many of your people in the land, and you are stopping them from their work."
02Ex 5:6 That same day Pharaoh sent this order to the Egyptian slave drivers and the Israelite foremen.
02Ex 5:7 "Do not supply any more straw for making bricks. Make the people get it themselves!
02Ex 5:8 But still require them to make the same number of bricks as before. Don't reduce the quota. They are lazy. That's why they are crying out, 'Let us go and offer sacrifices to our God.'
02Ex 5:9 Load them down with more work. Make them sweat! That will teach them to listen to lies!"
02Ex 5:10 So the slave drivers and foremen went out and told the people�� "This is what Pharaoh says�� I will not provide any more straw for you.
02Ex 5:11 Go and get it yourselves. Find it wherever you can. But you must produce just as many bricks as before!"
02Ex 5:12 So the people scattered throughout the land of Egypt in search of stubble to use as straw.
02Ex 5:13 Meanwhile, the Egyptian slave drivers continued to push hard. "Meet your daily quota of bricks, just as you did when we provided you with straw!" they demanded.
02Ex 5:14 Then they whipped the Israelite foremen they had put in charge of the work crews. "Why haven't you met your quotas either yesterday or today?" they demanded.
02Ex 5:15 So the Israelite foremen went to Pharaoh and pleaded with him. "Please don't treat your servants like this," they begged.
02Ex 5:16 "We are given no straw, but the slave drivers still demand, 'Make bricks!' We are being beaten, but it isn't our fault! Your own people are to blame!"
02Ex 5:17 But Pharaoh shouted, "You're just lazy! Lazy! That's why you're saying, 'Let us go and offer sacrifices to the LORD.'
02Ex 5:18 Now get back to work! No straw will be given to you, but you must still produce the full quota of bricks."
02Ex 5:19 The Israelite foremen could see that they were in serious trouble when they were told, "You must not reduce the number of bricks you make each day."
02Ex 5:20 As they left Pharaoh's court, they confronted Moses and Aaron, who were waiting outside for them.
02Ex 5:21 The foremen said to them, "May the LORD judge and punish you for making us stink before Pharaoh and his officials. You have put a sword into their hands, an excuse to kill us!"
02Ex 5:22 Then Moses went back to the LORD and protested, "Why have you brought all this trouble on your own people, Lord? Why did you send me?
02Ex 5:23 Ever since I came to Pharaoh as your spokesman, he has been even more brutal to your people. And you have done nothing to rescue them!"
02Ex 6:1 Then the LORD told Moses, "Now you will see what I will do to Pharaoh. When he feels the force of my strong hand, he will let the people go. In fact, he will force them to leave his land!"
02Ex 6:2 And God said to Moses, "I am Yahweh - 'the LORD.'�� / ��Yahweh is a transliteration of the proper name YHWH that is sometimes rendered "Jehovah"; in this translation it is usually rendered "the LORD" (note the use of small capitals)
02Ex 6:3 I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as El-Shaddai - 'God Almighty'�� - but I did not reveal my name, Yahweh, to them. / ��El-Shaddai, which means "God Almighty," is the name for God used in Gen 17.1; 28.3; 35.11; 43.14; 48.3
02Ex 6:4 And I reaffirmed my covenant with them. Under its terms, I promised to give them the land of Canaan, where they were living as foreigners.
02Ex 6:5 You can be sure that I have heard the groans of the people of Israel, who are now slaves to the Egyptians. And I am well aware of my covenant with them.
02Ex 6:6 "Therefore, say to the people of Israel�� 'I am the LORD. I will free you from your oppression and will rescue you from your slavery in Egypt. I will redeem you with a powerful arm and great acts of judgment.
02Ex 6:7 I will claim you as my own people, and I will be your God. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God who has freed you from your oppression in Egypt.
02Ex 6:8 I will bring you into the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I will give it to you as your very own possession. I am the LORD!'"
02Ex 6:9 So Moses told the people of Israel what the LORD had said, but they refused to listen anymore. They had become too discouraged by the brutality of their slavery.
02Ex 6:10 Then the LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 6:11 "Go back to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and tell him to let the people of Israel leave his country."
02Ex 6:12 "But LORD!" Moses objected. "My own people won't listen to me anymore. How can I expect Pharaoh to listen? I'm such a clumsy speaker!��" / ��Hebrew I have uncircumcised lips; also in 6.30
02Ex 6:13 But the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron and gave them orders for the Israelites and for Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. The LORD commanded Moses and Aaron to lead the people of Israel out of Egypt.
02Ex 6:14 These are the ancestors of some of the clans of Israel�� The sons of Reuben, Israel's oldest son, were Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. Their descendants became the clans of Reuben.
02Ex 6:15 The sons of Simeon were Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul. (Shaul's mother was a Canaanite woman.) Their descendants became the clans of Simeon.
02Ex 6:16 These are the descendants of Levi, as listed in their family records�� The sons of Levi were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. (Levi lived to be 137 years old.)
02Ex 6:17 The descendants of Gershon included Libni and Shimei, each of whom became the ancestor of a clan.
02Ex 6:18 The descendants of Kohath included Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. (Kohath lived to be 133 years old.)
02Ex 6:19 The descendants of Merari included Mahli and Mushi. These are the clans of the Levites, as listed in their family records.
02Ex 6:20 Amram married his father's sister Jochebed, and she gave birth to his sons, Aaron and Moses. (Amram lived to be 137 years old.)
02Ex 6:21 The sons of Izhar were Korah, Nepheg, and Zicri.
02Ex 6:22 The sons of Uzziel were Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
02Ex 6:23 Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and sister of Nahshon, and she gave birth to his sons, Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
02Ex 6:24 The sons of Korah were Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. Their descendants became the clans of Korah.
02Ex 6:25 Eleazar son of Aaron married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she gave birth to his son, Phinehas. These are the ancestors of the Levite families, listed according to their clans.
02Ex 6:26 The Aaron and Moses named in this list are the same ones to whom the LORD said, "Lead the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt like an army."
02Ex 6:27 It was Moses and Aaron who spoke to Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, about leading the people of Israel out of Egypt.
02Ex 6:28 When the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt,
02Ex 6:29 he said to him, "I am the LORD! Tell Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, everything I am telling you."
02Ex 6:30 But Moses argued with the LORD, saying, "I can't do it! I'm such a clumsy speaker! Why should Pharaoh listen to me?"
02Ex 7:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pay close attention to this. I will make you seem like God to Pharaoh, and your brother, Aaron, will be your prophet.
02Ex 7:2 Tell Aaron everything I command you, and Aaron must command Pharaoh to let the people of Israel leave his country.
02Ex 7:3 But I will make Pharaoh's heart stubborn so I can multiply my miraculous signs and wonders in the land of Egypt.
02Ex 7:4 Even then Pharaoh will refuse to listen to you. So I will bring down my fist on Egypt. Then I will rescue my forces - my people, the Israelites - from the land of Egypt with great acts of judgment.
02Ex 7:5 When I raise my powerful hand and bring out the Israelites, the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD."
02Ex 7:6 So Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded them.
02Ex 7:7 Moses was eighty years old, and Aaron was eighty-three when they made their demands to Pharaoh.
02Ex 7:8 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
02Ex 7:9 "Pharaoh will demand, 'Show me a miracle.' When he does this, say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it down in front of Pharaoh, and it will become a serpent��.'" / ��Hebrew tannin, which elsewhere refers to a sea monster. Greek version translates it "dragon"
02Ex 7:10 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and did what the LORD had commanded them. Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a serpent!
02Ex 7:11 Then Pharaoh called in his own wise men and sorcerers, and these Egyptian magicians did the same thing with their magic.
02Ex 7:12 They threw down their staffs, which also became serpents! But then Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs.
02Ex 7:13 Pharaoh's heart, however, remained hard. He still refused to listen, just as the LORD had predicted.
02Ex 7:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is stubborn��, and he still refuses to let the people go. / ��Hebrew heavy
02Ex 7:15 So go to Pharaoh in the morning as he goes down to the river. Stand on the bank of the Nile and meet him there. Be sure to take along the staff that turned into a snake.
02Ex 7:16 Then announce to him, 'The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to tell you, "Let my people go, so they can worship me in the wilderness." Until now, you have refused to listen to him.
02Ex 7:17 So this is what the LORD says�� "I will show you that I am the LORD." Look! I will strike the water of the Nile with this staff in my hand, and the river will turn to blood.
02Ex 7:18 The fish in it will die, and the river will stink. The Egyptians will not be able to drink any water from the Nile.'"
02Ex 7:19 Then the LORD said to Moses�� "Tell Aaron, 'Take your staff and raise your hand over the waters of Egypt - all its rivers, canals, ponds, and all the reservoirs. Turn all the water to blood. Everywhere in Egypt the water will turn to blood, even the water stored in wooden bowls and stone pots.'"
02Ex 7:20 So Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD commanded them. As Pharaoh and all of his officials watched, Aaron raised his staff and struck the water of the Nile. Suddenly, the whole river turned to blood!
02Ex 7:21 The fish in the river died, and the water became so foul that the Egyptians couldn't drink it. There was blood everywhere throughout the land of Egypt.
02Ex 7:22 But again the magicians of Egypt used their magic, and they, too, turned water into blood. So Pharaoh's heart remained hard. He refused to listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had predicted.
02Ex 7:23 Pharaoh returned to his palace and put the whole thing out of his mind.
02Ex 7:24 Then all the Egyptians dug along the riverbank to find drinking water, for they couldn't drink the water from the Nile.
02Ex 7:25 Seven days passed from the time the LORD struck the Nile.
02Ex 8:1 �� Then the LORD said to Moses, "Go back to Pharaoh and announce to him, 'This is what the LORD says�� Let my people go, so they can worship me. / ��Verses 8.1-4 are numbered 7.26-29 in Hebrew text
02Ex 8:2 If you refuse to let them go, I will send a plague of frogs across your entire land.
02Ex 8:3 The Nile River will swarm with frogs. They will come up out of the river and into your palace, even into your bedroom and onto your bed! They will enter the houses of your officials and your people. They will even jump into your ovens and your kneading bowls.
02Ex 8:4 Frogs will jump on you, your people, and all your officials.'"
02Ex 8:5 ��Then the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Raise the staff in your hand over all the rivers, canals, and ponds of Egypt, and bring up frogs over all the land.'" / ��Verses 8.5-32 are numbered 8.1-28 in Hebrew text
02Ex 8:6 So Aaron raised his hand over the waters of Egypt, and frogs came up and covered the whole land!
02Ex 8:7 But the magicians were able to do the same thing with their magic. They, too, caused frogs to come up on the land of Egypt.
02Ex 8:8 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and begged, "Plead with the LORD to take the frogs away from me and my people. I will let your people go, so they can offer sacrifices to the LORD."
02Ex 8:9 "You set the time!" Moses replied. "Tell me when you want me to pray for you, your officials, and your people. Then you and your houses will be rid of the frogs. They will remain only in the Nile River."
02Ex 8:10 "Do it tomorrow," Pharaoh said. "All right," Moses replied, "it will be as you have said. Then you will know that there is no one like the LORD our God.
02Ex 8:11 The frogs will leave you and your houses, your officials, and your people. They will remain only in the Nile River."
02Ex 8:12 So Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh's palace, and Moses cried out to the LORD about the frogs he had inflicted on Pharaoh.
02Ex 8:13 And the LORD did just what Moses had predicted. The frogs in the houses, the courtyards, and the fields all died.
02Ex 8:14 The Egyptians piled them into great heaps, and a terrible stench filled the land.
02Ex 8:15 But when Pharaoh saw that relief had come, he became stubborn��. He refused to listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had predicted. / ��Hebrew made his heart heavy; also in 8.32
02Ex 8:16 So the LORD said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Raise your staff and strike the ground. The dust will turn into swarms of gnats throughout the land of Egypt.'"
02Ex 8:17 So Moses and Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded them. When Aaron raised his hand and struck the ground with his staff, gnats infested the entire land, covering the Egyptians and their animals. All the dust in the land of Egypt turned into gnats.
02Ex 8:18 Pharaoh's magicians tried to do the same thing with their secret arts, but this time they failed. And the gnats covered everyone, people and animals alike.
02Ex 8:19 "This is the finger of God!" the magicians exclaimed to Pharaoh. But Pharaoh's heart remained hard. He wouldn't listen to them, just as the LORD had predicted.
02Ex 8:20 Then the LORD told Moses, "Get up early in the morning and stand in Pharaoh's way as he goes down to the river. Say to him, 'This is what the LORD says�� Let my people go, so they can worship me.
02Ex 8:21 If you refuse, then I will send swarms of flies on you, your officials, your people, and all the houses. The Egyptian homes will be filled with flies, and the ground will be covered with them.
02Ex 8:22 But this time I will spare the region of Goshen, where my people live. No flies will be found there. Then you will know that I am the LORD and that I am present even in the heart of your land.
02Ex 8:23 I will make a clear distinction between�� my people and your people. This miraculous sign will happen tomorrow.'" / ��As in Greek and Latin versions; Hebrew reads I will set redemption between
02Ex 8:24 And the LORD did just as he had said. A thick swarm of flies filled Pharaoh's palace and the houses of his officials. The whole land of Egypt was thrown into chaos by the flies.
02Ex 8:25 Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron. "All right! Go ahead and offer sacrifices to your God," he said. "But do it here in this land."
02Ex 8:26 But Moses replied, "That wouldn't be right. The Egyptians detest the sacrifices that we offer to the LORD our God. Look, if we offer our sacrifices here where the Egyptians can see us, they will stone us.
02Ex 8:27 We must take a three-day trip into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD our God, just as he has commanded us."
02Ex 8:28 "All right, go ahead," Pharaoh replied. "I will let you go into the wilderness to offer sacrifices to the LORD your God. But don't go too far away. Now hurry and pray for me."
02Ex 8:29 Moses answered, "As soon as I leave you, I will pray to the LORD, and tomorrow the swarms of flies will disappear from you and your officials and all your people. But I am warning you, Pharaoh, don't lie to us again and refuse to let the people go to sacrifice to the LORD."
02Ex 8:30 So Moses left Pharaoh's palace and pleaded with the LORD to remove all the flies.
02Ex 8:31 And the LORD did as Moses asked and caused the swarms of flies to disappear from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. Not a single fly remained.
02Ex 8:32 But Pharaoh again became stubborn and refused to let the people go.
02Ex 9:1 "Go back to Pharaoh," the LORD commanded Moses. "Tell him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says�� Let my people go, so they can worship me.
02Ex 9:2 If you continue to hold them and refuse to let them go,
02Ex 9:3 the hand of the LORD will strike all your livestock - your horses, donkeys, camels, cattle, sheep, and goats - with a deadly plague.
02Ex 9:4 But the LORD will again make a distinction between the livestock of the Israelites and that of the Egyptians. Not a single one of Israel's animals will die!
02Ex 9:5 The LORD has already set the time for the plague to begin. He has declared that he will strike the land tomorrow.'"
02Ex 9:6 And the LORD did just as he had said. The next morning all the livestock of the Egyptians died, but the Israelites didn't lose a single animal.
02Ex 9:7 Pharaoh sent his officials to investigate, and they discovered that the Israelites had not lost a single animal! But even so, Pharaoh's heart remained stubborn��, and he still refused to let the people go. / ��Hebrew heavy
02Ex 9:8 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of soot from a brick kiln, and have Moses toss it into the air while Pharaoh watches.
02Ex 9:9 The ashes will spread like fine dust over the whole land of Egypt, causing festering boils to break out on people and animals throughout the land."
02Ex 9:10 So they took soot from a brick kiln and went and stood before Pharaoh. As Pharaoh watched, Moses threw the soot into the air, and boils broke out on people and animals alike.
02Ex 9:11 Even the magicians were unable to stand before Moses, because the boils had broken out on them and all the Egyptians.
02Ex 9:12 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and just as the LORD had predicted to Moses, Pharaoh refused to listen.
02Ex 9:13 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh. Tell him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says�� Let my people go, so they can worship me.
02Ex 9:14 If you don't, I will send more plagues on you�� and your officials and your people. Then you will know that there is no one like me in all the earth. / ��Hebrew on your heart
02Ex 9:15 By now I could have lifted my hand and struck you and your people with a plague to wipe you off the face of the earth.
02Ex 9:16 But I have spared you for a purpose - to show you my power�� and to spread my fame throughout the earth. / ��Greek version reads to display my power in you; compare Rom 9.17
02Ex 9:17 But you still lord it over my people and refuse to let them go.
02Ex 9:18 So tomorrow at this time I will send a hailstorm more devastating than any in all the history of Egypt.
02Ex 9:19 Quick! Order your livestock and servants to come in from the fields to find shelter. Any person or animal left outside will die when the hail falls.'"
02Ex 9:20 Some of Pharaoh's officials were afraid because of what the LORD had said. They quickly brought their servants and livestock in from the fields.
02Ex 9:21 But those who paid no attention to the word of the LORD left theirs out in the open.
02Ex 9:22 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Lift your hand toward the sky so hail may fall on the people, the livestock, and all the plants throughout the land of Egypt."
02Ex 9:23 So Moses lifted his staff toward the sky, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning flashed toward the earth. The LORD sent a tremendous hailstorm against all the land of Egypt.
02Ex 9:24 Never in all the history of Egypt had there been a storm like that, with such devastating hail and continuous lightning.
02Ex 9:25 It left all of Egypt in ruins. The hail struck down everything in the open field - people, animals, and plants alike. Even the trees were destroyed.
02Ex 9:26 The only place without hail was the region of Goshen, where the people of Israel lived.
02Ex 9:27 Then Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron. "This time I have sinned," he confessed. "The LORD is the righteous one, and my people and I are wrong.
02Ex 9:28 Please beg the LORD to end this terrifying thunder and hail. We've had enough. I will let you go; you don't need to stay any longer."
02Ex 9:29 "All right," Moses replied. "As soon as I leave the city, I will lift my hands and pray to the LORD. Then the thunder and hail will stop, and you will know that the earth belongs to the LORD.
02Ex 9:30 But I know that you and your officials still do not fear the LORD God."
02Ex 9:31 (All the flax and barley were ruined by the hail, because the barley had formed heads and the flax was budding.
02Ex 9:32 But the wheat and the emmer wheat were spared, because they had not yet sprouted from the ground.)
02Ex 9:33 So Moses left Pharaoh's court and went out of the city. When he lifted his hands to the LORD, the thunder and hail stopped, and the downpour ceased.
02Ex 9:34 But when Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had stopped, he and his officials sinned again, and Pharaoh again became stubborn��. / ��Hebrew made his heart heavy
02Ex 9:35 Because his heart was hard, Pharaoh refused to let the people leave, just as the LORD had predicted through Moses.
02Ex 10:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Return to Pharaoh and make your demands again. I have made him and his officials stubborn�� so I can display my miraculous signs among them. / ��Hebrew have made his heart and his officials' hearts heavy
02Ex 10:2 I've also done it so you can tell your children and grandchildren about how I made a mockery of the Egyptians and about the signs I displayed among them - and so you will know that I am the LORD."
02Ex 10:3 So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said, "This is what the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, says�� How long will you refuse to submit to me? Let my people go, so they can worship me.
02Ex 10:4 If you refuse, watch out! For tomorrow I will bring a swarm of locusts on your country.
02Ex 10:5 They will cover the land so that you won't be able to see the ground. They will devour what little is left of your crops after the hailstorm, including all the trees growing in the fields.
02Ex 10:6 They will overrun your palaces and the homes of your officials and all the houses in Egypt. Never in the history of Egypt have your ancestors seen a plague like this one!" And with that, Moses turned and left Pharaoh.
02Ex 10:7 Pharaoh's officials now came to Pharaoh and appealed to him. "How long will you let this man hold us hostage? Let the men go to worship the LORD their God! Don't you realize that Egypt lies in ruins?"
02Ex 10:8 So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh. "All right," he told them, "go and worship the LORD your God. But who exactly will be going with you?"
02Ex 10:9 Moses replied, "We will all go - young and old, our sons and daughters, and our flocks and herds. We must all join together in celebrating a festival to the LORD."
02Ex 10:10 Pharaoh retorted, "The LORD will certainly need to be with you if I let you take your little ones! I can see through your evil plan.
02Ex 10:11 Never! Only the men may go and worship the LORD, since that is what you requested." And Pharaoh threw them out of the palace.
02Ex 10:12 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Raise your hand over the land of Egypt to bring on the locusts. Let them cover the land and devour every plant that survived the hailstorm."
02Ex 10:13 So Moses raised his staff over Egypt, and the LORD caused an east wind to blow over the land all that day and through the night. When morning arrived, the east wind had brought the locusts.
02Ex 10:14 And the locusts swarmed over the whole land of Egypt, settling in dense swarms from one end of the country to the other. It was the worst locust plague in Egyptian history, and there has never been another one like it.
02Ex 10:15 For the locusts covered the whole country and darkened the land. They devoured every plant in the fields and all the fruit on the trees that had survived the hailstorm. Not a single leaf was left on the trees and plants throughout the land of Egypt.
02Ex 10:16 Pharaoh quickly summoned Moses and Aaron. "I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you," he confessed.
02Ex 10:17 "Forgive my sin, just this once, and plead with the LORD your God to take away this death from me."
02Ex 10:18 So Moses left Pharaoh's court and pleaded with the LORD.
02Ex 10:19 The LORD responded by shifting the wind, and the strong west wind blew the locusts into the Red Sea��. Not a single locust remained in all the land of Egypt. / ��Hebrew sea of reeds
02Ex 10:20 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart again, so he refused to let the people go.
02Ex 10:21 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Lift your hand toward heaven, and the land of Egypt will be covered with a darkness so thick you can feel it."
02Ex 10:22 So Moses lifted his hand to the sky, and a deep darkness covered the entire land of Egypt for three days.
02Ex 10:23 During all that time the people could not see each other, and no one moved. But there was light as usual where the people of Israel lived.
02Ex 10:24 Finally, Pharaoh called for Moses. "Go and worship the LORD," he said. "But leave your flocks and herds here. You may even take your little ones with you."
02Ex 10:25 "No," Moses said, "you must provide us with animals for sacrifices and burnt offerings to the LORD our God.
02Ex 10:26 All our livestock must go with us, too; not a hoof can be left behind. We must choose our sacrifices for the LORD our God from among these animals. And we won't know how we are to worship the LORD until we get there."
02Ex 10:27 But the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart once more, and he would not let them go.
02Ex 10:28 "Get out of here!" Pharaoh shouted at Moses. "I'm warning you. Never come back to see me again! The day you see my face, you will die!"
02Ex 10:29 "Very well," Moses replied. "I will never see your face again."
02Ex 11:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "I will strike Pharaoh and the land of Egypt with one more blow. After that, Pharaoh will let you leave this country. In fact, he will be so eager to get rid of you that he will force you all to leave.
02Ex 11:2 Tell all the Israelite men and women to ask their Egyptian neighbors for articles of silver and gold."
02Ex 11:3 (Now the LORD had caused the Egyptians to look favorably on the people of Israel. And Moses was considered a very great man in the land of Egypt, respected by Pharaoh's officials and the Egyptian people alike.)
02Ex 11:4 Moses had announced to Pharaoh, "This is what the LORD says�� At midnight tonight I will pass through the heart of Egypt.
02Ex 11:5 All the firstborn sons will die in every family in Egypt, from the oldest son of Pharaoh, who sits on his throne, to the oldest son of his lowliest servant girl who grinds the flour. Even the firstborn of all the livestock will die.
02Ex 11:6 Then a loud wail will rise throughout the land of Egypt, a wail like no one has heard before or will ever hear again.
02Ex 11:7 But among the Israelites it will be so peaceful that not even a dog will bark. Then you will know that the LORD makes a distinction between the Egyptians and the Israelites.
02Ex 11:8 All the officials of Egypt will run to me and fall to the ground before me. 'Please leave!' they will beg. 'Hurry! And take all your followers with you.' Only then will I go!" Then, burning with anger, Moses left Pharaoh.
02Ex 11:9 Now the LORD had told Moses earlier, "Pharaoh will not listen to you, but then I will do even more mighty miracles in the land of Egypt."
02Ex 11:10 Moses and Aaron performed these miracles in Pharaoh's presence, but the LORD hardened Pharaoh's heart, and he wouldn't let the Israelites leave the country.
02Ex 12:1 While the Israelites were still in the land of Egypt, the LORD gave the following instructions to Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 12:2 "From now on, this month will be the first month of the year for you.
02Ex 12:3 Announce to the whole community of Israel that on the tenth day of this month each family must choose a lamb or a young goat for a sacrifice, one animal for each household.
02Ex 12:4 If a family is too small to eat a whole animal, let them share with another family in the neighborhood. Divide the animal according to the size of each family and how much they can eat.
02Ex 12:5 The animal you select must be a one-year-old male, either a sheep or a goat, with no defects.
02Ex 12:6 "Take special care of this chosen animal until the evening of the fourteenth day of this first month. Then the whole assembly of the community of Israel must slaughter their lamb or young goat at twilight.
02Ex 12:7 They are to take some of the blood and smear it on the sides and top of the doorframes of the houses where they eat the animal.
02Ex 12:8 That same night they must roast the meat over a fire and eat it along with bitter salad greens and bread made without yeast.
02Ex 12:9 Do not eat any of the meat raw or boiled in water. The whole animal - including the head, legs, and internal organs - must be roasted over a fire.
02Ex 12:10 Do not leave any of it until the next morning. Burn whatever is not eaten before morning.
02Ex 12:11 "These are your instructions for eating this meal�� Be fully dressed��, wear your sandals, and carry your walking stick in your hand. Eat the meal with urgency, for this is the LORD's Passover. / ��Hebrew Bind up your loins
02Ex 12:12 On that night I will pass through the land of Egypt and strike down every firstborn son and firstborn male animal in the land of Egypt. I will execute judgment against all the gods of Egypt, for I am the LORD!
02Ex 12:13 But the blood on your doorposts will serve as a sign, marking the houses where you are staying. When I see the blood, I will pass over you. This plague of death will not touch you when I strike the land of Egypt.
02Ex 12:14 "This is a day to remember. Each year, from generation to generation, you must celebrate it as a special festival to the LORD. This is a law for all time.
02Ex 12:15 For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast. On the first day of the festival, remove every trace of yeast from your homes. Anyone who eats bread made with yeast during the seven days of the festival will be cut off from the community of Israel.
02Ex 12:16 On the first day of the festival and again on the seventh day, all the people must observe an official day for holy assembly. No work of any kind may be done on these days except in the preparation of food.
02Ex 12:17 "Celebrate this Festival of Unleavened Bread, for it will remind you that I brought your forces out of the land of Egypt on this very day. This festival will be a permanent law for you; celebrate this day from generation to generation.
02Ex 12:18 The bread you eat must be made without yeast from the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month until the evening of the twenty-first day of that month.
02Ex 12:19 During those seven days, there must be no trace of yeast in your homes. Anyone who eats anything made with yeast during this week will be cut off from the community of Israel. These regulations apply both to the foreigners living among you and to the native-born Israelites.
02Ex 12:20 During those days you must not eat anything made with yeast. Wherever you live, eat only bread made without yeast."
02Ex 12:21 Then Moses called all the elders of Israel together and said to them, "Go, pick out a lamb or young goat for each of your families, and slaughter the Passover animal.
02Ex 12:22 Drain the blood into a basin. Then take a bundle of hyssop branches and dip it into the blood. Brush the hyssop across the top and sides of the doorframes of your houses. And no one may go out through the door until morning.
02Ex 12:23 For the LORD will pass through the land to strike down the Egyptians. But when he sees the blood on the top and sides of the doorframe, the LORD will pass over your home. He will not permit his death angel to enter your house and strike you down.
02Ex 12:24 "Remember, these instructions are a permanent law that you and your descendants must observe forever.
02Ex 12:25 When you enter the land the LORD has promised to give you, you will continue to observe this ceremony.
02Ex 12:26 Then your children will ask, 'What does this ceremony mean?'
02Ex 12:27 And you will reply, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the LORD, for he passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt. And though he struck the Egyptians, he spared our families.'" When Moses had finished speaking, all the people bowed down to the ground and worshiped.
02Ex 12:28 So the people of Israel did just as the LORD had commanded through Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 12:29 And that night at midnight, the LORD struck down all the firstborn sons in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn son of Pharaoh, who sat on his throne, to the firstborn son of the prisoner in the dungeon. Even the firstborn of their livestock were killed.
02Ex 12:30 Pharaoh and all his officials and all the people of Egypt woke up during the night, and loud wailing was heard throughout the land of Egypt. There was not a single house where someone had not died.
02Ex 12:31 Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron during the night. "Get out!" he ordered. "Leave my people - and take the rest of the Israelites with you! Go and worship the LORD as you have requested.
02Ex 12:32 Take your flocks and herds, as you said, and be gone. Go, but bless me as you leave."
02Ex 12:33 All the Egyptians urged the people of Israel to get out of the land as quickly as possible, for they thought, "We will all die!"
02Ex 12:34 The Israelites took their bread dough before yeast was added. They wrapped their kneading boards in their cloaks and carried them on their shoulders.
02Ex 12:35 And the people of Israel did as Moses had instructed; they asked the Egyptians for clothing and articles of silver and gold.
02Ex 12:36 The LORD caused the Egyptians to look favorably on the Israelites, and they gave the Israelites whatever they asked for. So they stripped the Egyptians of their wealth!
02Ex 12:37 That night the people of Israel left Rameses and started for Succoth. There were about 600,000 men��, plus all the women and children. / ��Or fighting men; Hebrew reads men on foot
02Ex 12:38 A rabble of non-Israelites went with them, along with great flocks and herds of livestock.
02Ex 12:39 For bread they baked flat cakes from the dough without yeast they had brought from Egypt. It was made without yeast because the people were driven out of Egypt in such a hurry that they had no time to prepare the bread or other food.
02Ex 12:40 The people of Israel had lived in Egypt�� for 430 years. / ��Samaritan Pentateuch reads in Canaan and Egypt; Greek version reads in Egypt and Canaan
02Ex 12:41 In fact, it was on the last day of the 430th year that all the LORD's forces left the land.
02Ex 12:42 On this night the LORD kept his promise to bring his people out of the land of Egypt. So this night belongs to him, and it must be commemorated every year by all the Israelites, from generation to generation.
02Ex 12:43 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "These are the instructions for the festival of Passover. No outsiders are allowed to eat the Passover meal.
02Ex 12:44 But any slave who has been purchased may eat it if he has been circumcised.
02Ex 12:45 Temporary residents and hired servants may not eat it.
02Ex 12:46 Each Passover lamb must be eaten in one house. Do not carry any of its meat outside, and do not break any of its bones.
02Ex 12:47 The whole community of Israel must celebrate this Passover festival.
02Ex 12:48 "If there are foreigners living among you who want to celebrate the LORD's Passover, let all their males be circumcised. Only then may they celebrate the Passover with you like any native-born Israelite. But no uncircumcised male may ever eat the Passover meal.
02Ex 12:49 This instruction applies to everyone, whether a native-born Israelite or a foreigner living among you."
02Ex 12:50 So all the people of Israel followed all the LORD's commands to Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 12:51 On that very day the LORD brought the people of Israel out of the land of Egypt like an army.
02Ex 13:1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 13:2 "Dedicate to me every firstborn among the Israelites. The first offspring to be born, of both humans and animals, belongs to me."
02Ex 13:3 So Moses said to the people, "This is a day to remember forever - the day you left Egypt, the place of your slavery. Today the LORD has brought you out by the power of his mighty hand. (Remember, eat no food containing yeast.)
02Ex 13:4 On this day in early spring, in the month of Abib��, you have been set free. / ��Hebrew On this day in the month of Abib. This first month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of March and April
02Ex 13:5 You must celebrate this event in this month each year after the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Hivites, and Jebusites. (He swore to your ancestors that he would give you this land - a land flowing with milk and honey.)
02Ex 13:6 For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast. Then on the seventh day, celebrate a feast to the LORD.
02Ex 13:7 Eat bread without yeast during those seven days. In fact, there must be no yeast bread or any yeast at all found within the borders of your land during this time.
02Ex 13:8 "On the seventh day you must explain to your children, 'I am celebrating what the LORD did for me when I left Egypt.'
02Ex 13:9 This annual festival will be a visible sign to you, like a mark branded on your hand or your forehead. Let it remind you always to recite this teaching of the LORD�� 'With a strong hand, the LORD rescued you from Egypt.'�� / ��Or Let it remind you always to keep the instructions of the LORD on the tip of your tongue, because with a strong hand, the LORD rescued you from Egypt
02Ex 13:10 So observe the decree of this festival at the appointed time each year.
02Ex 13:11 "This is what you must do when the LORD fulfills the promise he swore to you and to your ancestors. When he gives you the land where the Canaanites now live,
02Ex 13:12 you must present all firstborn sons and firstborn male animals to the LORD, for they belong to him.
02Ex 13:13 A firstborn donkey may be bought back from the LORD by presenting a lamb or young goat in its place. But if you do not buy it back, you must break its neck. However, you must buy back every firstborn son.
02Ex 13:14 "And in the future, your children will ask you, 'What does all this mean?' Then you will tell them, 'With the power of his mighty hand, the LORD brought us out of Egypt, the place of our slavery.
02Ex 13:15 Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, so the LORD killed all the firstborn males throughout the land of Egypt, both people and animals. That is why I now sacrifice all the firstborn males to the LORD - except that the firstborn sons are always bought back.'
02Ex 13:16 This ceremony will be like a mark branded on your hand or your forehead. It is a reminder that the power of the LORD's mighty hand brought us out of Egypt."
02Ex 13:17 When Pharaoh finally let the people go, God did not lead them along the main road that runs through Philistine territory, even though that was the shortest route to the Promised Land. God said, "If the people are faced with a battle, they might change their minds and return to Egypt."
02Ex 13:18 So God led them in a roundabout way through the wilderness toward the Red Sea��. Thus the Israelites left Egypt like an army ready for battle��. / ��Hebrew sea of reeds ��Greek version reads left Egypt in the fifth generation
02Ex 13:19 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had made the sons of Israel swear to do this. He said, "God will certainly come to help you. When he does, you must take my bones with you from this place."
02Ex 13:20 The Israelites left Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
02Ex 13:21 The LORD went ahead of them. He guided them during the day with a pillar of cloud, and he provided light at night with a pillar of fire. This allowed them to travel by day or by night.
02Ex 13:22 And the LORD did not remove the pillar of cloud or pillar of fire from its place in front of the people.
02Ex 14:1 Then the LORD gave these instructions to Moses.
02Ex 14:2 "Order the Israelites to turn back and camp by Pi-hahiroth between Migdol and the sea. Camp there along the shore, across from Baal-zephon.
02Ex 14:3 Then Pharaoh will think, 'The Israelites are confused. They are trapped in the wilderness!'
02Ex 14:4 And once again I will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he will chase after you��. I have planned this in order to display my glory through Pharaoh and his whole army. After this the Egyptians will know that I am the LORD!" So the Israelites camped there as they were told. / ��Hebrew after them
02Ex 14:5 When word reached the king of Egypt that the Israelites had fled, Pharaoh and his officials changed their minds. "What have we done, letting all those Israelite slaves get away?" they asked.
02Ex 14:6 So Pharaoh harnessed his chariot and called up his troops.
02Ex 14:7 He took with him 600 of Egypt's best chariots, along with the rest of the chariots of Egypt, each with its commander.
02Ex 14:8 The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, so he chased after the people of Israel, who had left with fists raised in defiance.
02Ex 14:9 The Egyptians chased after them with all the forces in Pharaoh's army - all his horses and chariots, his charioteers, and his troops. The Egyptians caught up with the people of Israel as they were camped beside the shore near Pi-hahiroth, across from Baal-zephon.
02Ex 14:10 As Pharaoh approached, the people of Israel looked up and panicked when they saw the Egyptians overtaking them. They cried out to the LORD,
02Ex 14:11 and they said to Moses, "Why did you bring us out here to die in the wilderness? Weren't there enough graves for us in Egypt? What have you done to us? Why did you make us leave Egypt?
02Ex 14:12 Didn't we tell you this would happen while we were still in Egypt? We said, 'Leave us alone! Let us be slaves to the Egyptians. It's better to be a slave in Egypt than a corpse in the wilderness!'"
02Ex 14:13 But Moses told the people, "Don't be afraid. Just stand still and watch the LORD rescue you today. The Egyptians you see today will never be seen again.
02Ex 14:14 The LORD himself will fight for you. Just stay calm."
02Ex 14:15 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me? Tell the people to get moving!
02Ex 14:16 Pick up your staff and raise your hand over the sea. Divide the water so the Israelites can walk through the middle of the sea on dry ground.
02Ex 14:17 And I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will charge in after the Israelites. My great glory will be displayed through Pharaoh and his troops, his chariots, and his charioteers.
02Ex 14:18 When my glory is displayed through them, all Egypt will see my glory and know that I am the LORD!"
02Ex 14:19 Then the angel of God, who had been leading the people of Israel, moved to the rear of the camp. The pillar of cloud also moved from the front and stood behind them.
02Ex 14:20 The cloud settled between the Egyptian and Israelite camps. As darkness fell, the cloud turned to fire, lighting up the night. But the Egyptians and Israelites did not approach each other all night.
02Ex 14:21 Then Moses raised his hand over the sea, and the LORD opened up a path through the water with a strong east wind. The wind blew all that night, turning the seabed into dry land.
02Ex 14:22 So the people of Israel walked through the middle of the sea on dry ground, with walls of water on each side!
02Ex 14:23 Then the Egyptians - all of Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and charioteers - chased them into the middle of the sea.
02Ex 14:24 But just before dawn the LORD looked down on the Egyptian army from the pillar of fire and cloud, and he threw their forces into total confusion.
02Ex 14:25 He twisted�� their chariot wheels, making their chariots difficult to drive. "Let's get out of here - away from these Israelites!" the Egyptians shouted. "The LORD is fighting for them against Egypt!" / ��As in Greek version, Samaritan Pentateuch, and Syriac version; Hebrew reads He removed
02Ex 14:26 When all the Israelites had reached the other side, the LORD said to Moses, "Raise your hand over the sea again. Then the waters will rush back and cover the Egyptians and their chariots and charioteers."
02Ex 14:27 So as the sun began to rise, Moses raised his hand over the sea, and the water rushed back into its usual place. The Egyptians tried to escape, but the LORD swept them into the sea.
02Ex 14:28 Then the waters returned and covered all the chariots and charioteers - the entire army of Pharaoh. Of all the Egyptians who had chased the Israelites into the sea, not a single one survived.
02Ex 14:29 But the people of Israel had walked through the middle of the sea on dry ground, as the water stood up like a wall on both sides.
02Ex 14:30 That is how the LORD rescued Israel from the hand of the Egyptians that day. And the Israelites saw the bodies of the Egyptians washed up on the seashore.
02Ex 14:31 When the people of Israel saw the mighty power that the LORD had unleashed against the Egyptians, they were filled with awe before him. They put their faith in the LORD and in his servant Moses.
02Ex 15:1 Then Moses and the people of Israel sang this song to the LORD�� "I will sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; he has hurled both horse and rider into the sea.
02Ex 15:2 The LORD is my strength and my song; he has given me victory. This is my God, and I will praise him - my father's God, and I will exalt him!
02Ex 15:3 The LORD is a warrior; Yahweh�� is his name!  / ��Yahweh is a transliteration of the proper name YHWH that is sometimes rendered "Jehovah"; in this translation it is usually rendered "the LORD" (note the use of small capitals)
02Ex 15:4 Pharaoh's chariots and army he has hurled into the sea. The finest of Pharaoh's officers are drowned in the Red Sea��. / ��Hebrew sea of reeds; also in 15.22
02Ex 15:5 The deep waters gushed over them; they sank to the bottom like a stone.
02Ex 15:6 "Your right hand, O LORD, is glorious in power. Your right hand, O LORD, smashes the enemy.
02Ex 15:7 In the greatness of your majesty, you overthrow those who rise against you. You unleash your blazing fury; it consumes them like straw.
02Ex 15:8 At the blast of your breath, the waters piled up! The surging waters stood straight like a wall; in the heart of the sea the deep waters became hard.
02Ex 15:9 "The enemy boasted, 'I will chase them and catch up with them. I will plunder them and consume them. I will flash my sword; my powerful hand will destroy them.'
02Ex 15:10 But you blew with your breath, and the sea covered them. They sank like lead in the mighty waters.
02Ex 15:11 "Who is like you among the gods, O LORD - glorious in holiness, awesome in splendor, performing great wonders?
02Ex 15:12 You raised your right hand, and the earth swallowed our enemies.
02Ex 15:13 "With your unfailing love you lead the people you have redeemed. In your might, you guide them to your sacred home.
02Ex 15:14 The peoples hear and tremble; anguish grips those who live in Philistia.
02Ex 15:15 The leaders of Edom are terrified; the nobles of Moab tremble. All who live in Canaan melt away;
02Ex 15:16   terror and dread fall upon them. The power of your arm makes them lifeless as stone until your people pass by, O LORD, until the people you purchased pass by.
02Ex 15:17 You will bring them in and plant them on your own mountain - the place, O LORD, reserved for your own dwelling, the sanctuary, O Lord, that your hands have established.
02Ex 15:18 The LORD will reign forever and ever!"
02Ex 15:19 When Pharaoh's horses, chariots, and charioteers rushed into the sea, the LORD brought the water crashing down on them. But the people of Israel had walked through the middle of the sea on dry ground!
02Ex 15:20 Then Miriam the prophet, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine and led all the women as they played their tambourines and danced.
02Ex 15:21 And Miriam sang this song�� "Sing to the LORD, for he has triumphed gloriously; he has hurled both horse and rider into the sea."
02Ex 15:22 Then Moses led the people of Israel away from the Red Sea, and they moved out into the desert of Shur. They traveled in this desert for three days without finding any water.
02Ex 15:23 When they came to the oasis of Marah, the water was too bitter to drink. So they called the place Marah (which means "bitter").
02Ex 15:24 Then the people complained and turned against Moses. "What are we going to drink?" they demanded.
02Ex 15:25 So Moses cried out to the LORD for help, and the LORD showed him a piece of wood. Moses threw it into the water, and this made the water good to drink. It was there at Marah that the LORD set before them the following decree as a standard to test their faithfulness to him.
02Ex 15:26 He said, "If you will listen carefully to the voice of the LORD your God and do what is right in his sight, obeying his commands and keeping all his decrees, then I will not make you suffer any of the diseases I sent on the Egyptians; for I am the LORD who heals you."
02Ex 15:27 After leaving Marah, the Israelites traveled on to the oasis of Elim, where they found twelve springs and seventy palm trees. They camped there beside the water.
02Ex 16:1 Then the whole community of Israel set out from Elim and journeyed into the wilderness of Sin��, between Elim and Mount Sinai. They arrived there on the fifteenth day of the second month, one month after leaving the land of Egypt��. / ��The geographical name Sin is related to Sinai and should not be confused with the English word sin ��The Exodus had occurred on the fifteenth day of the first month (see Num 33.3)
02Ex 16:2 There, too, the whole community of Israel complained about Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 16:3 "If only the LORD had killed us back in Egypt," they moaned. "There we sat around pots filled with meat and ate all the bread we wanted. But now you have brought us into this wilderness to starve us all to death."
02Ex 16:4 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Look, I'm going to rain down food from heaven for you. Each day the people can go out and pick up as much food as they need for that day. I will test them in this to see whether or not they will follow my instructions.
02Ex 16:5 On the sixth day they will gather food, and when they prepare it, there will be twice as much as usual."
02Ex 16:6 So Moses and Aaron said to all the people of Israel, "By evening you will realize it was the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt.
02Ex 16:7 In the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, because he has heard your complaints, which are against him, not against us. What have we done that you should complain about us?"
02Ex 16:8 Then Moses added, "The LORD will give you meat to eat in the evening and bread to satisfy you in the morning, for he has heard all your complaints against him. What have we done? Yes, your complaints are against the LORD, not against us."
02Ex 16:9 Then Moses said to Aaron, "Announce this to the entire community of Israel�� 'Present yourselves before the LORD, for he has heard your complaining.'"
02Ex 16:10 And as Aaron spoke to the whole community of Israel, they looked out toward the wilderness. There they could see the awesome glory of the LORD in the cloud.
02Ex 16:11 Then the LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 16:12 "I have heard the Israelites' complaints. Now tell them, 'In the evening you will have meat to eat, and in the morning you will have all the bread you want. Then you will know that I am the LORD your God.'"
02Ex 16:13 That evening vast numbers of quail flew in and covered the camp. And the next morning the area around the camp was wet with dew.
02Ex 16:14 When the dew evaporated, a flaky substance as fine as frost blanketed the ground.
02Ex 16:15 The Israelites were puzzled when they saw it. "What is it?" they asked each other. They had no idea what it was. And Moses told them, "It is the food the LORD has given you to eat.
02Ex 16:16 These are the LORD's instructions�� Each household should gather as much as it needs. Pick up two quarts�� for each person in your tent." / ��Hebrew 1 omer [2 liters]; also in 16.32, 33
02Ex 16:17 So the people of Israel did as they were told. Some gathered a lot, some only a little.
02Ex 16:18 But when they measured it out��, everyone had just enough. Those who gathered a lot had nothing left over, and those who gathered only a little had enough. Each family had just what it needed. / ��Hebrew measured it with an omer
02Ex 16:19 Then Moses told them, "Do not keep any of it until morning."
02Ex 16:20 But some of them didn't listen and kept some of it until morning. But by then it was full of maggots and had a terrible smell. Moses was very angry with them.
02Ex 16:21 After this the people gathered the food morning by morning, each family according to its need. And as the sun became hot, the flakes they had not picked up melted and disappeared.
02Ex 16:22 On the sixth day, they gathered twice as much as usual - four quarts�� for each person instead of two. Then all the leaders of the community came and asked Moses for an explanation. / ��Hebrew 2 omers [4 liters]
02Ex 16:23 He told them, "This is what the LORD commanded�� Tomorrow will be a day of complete rest, a holy Sabbath day set apart for the LORD. So bake or boil as much as you want today, and set aside what is left for tomorrow."
02Ex 16:24 So they put some aside until morning, just as Moses had commanded. And in the morning the leftover food was wholesome and good, without maggots or odor.
02Ex 16:25 Moses said, "Eat this food today, for today is a Sabbath day dedicated to the LORD. There will be no food on the ground today.
02Ex 16:26 You may gather the food for six days, but the seventh day is the Sabbath. There will be no food on the ground that day."
02Ex 16:27 Some of the people went out anyway on the seventh day, but they found no food.
02Ex 16:28 The LORD asked Moses, "How long will these people refuse to obey my commands and instructions?
02Ex 16:29 They must realize that the Sabbath is the LORD's gift to you. That is why he gives you a two-day supply on the sixth day, so there will be enough for two days. On the Sabbath day you must each stay in your place. Do not go out to pick up food on the seventh day."
02Ex 16:30 So the people did not gather any food on the seventh day.
02Ex 16:31 The Israelites called the food manna��. It was white like coriander seed, and it tasted like honey wafers. / ��Manna means "What is it?" See 16.15
02Ex 16:32 Then Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded�� Fill a two-quart container with manna to preserve it for your descendants. Then later generations will be able to see the food I gave you in the wilderness when I set you free from Egypt."
02Ex 16:33 Moses said to Aaron, "Get a jar and fill it with two quarts of manna. Then put it in a sacred place before the LORD to preserve it for all future generations."
02Ex 16:34 Aaron did just as the LORD had commanded Moses. He eventually placed it in the Ark of the Covenant - in front of the stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant��. / ��Hebrew He placed it in front of the Testimony; see note on 25.16
02Ex 16:35 So the people of Israel ate manna for forty years until they arrived at the land where they would settle. They ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan.
02Ex 16:36 The container used to measure the manna was an omer, which was one tenth of an ephah; it held about two quarts��. / ��Hebrew An omer is one tenth of an ephah
02Ex 17:1 At the LORD's command, the whole community of Israel left the wilderness of Sin�� and moved from place to place. Eventually they camped at Rephidim, but there was no water there for the people to drink. / ��The geographical name Sin is related to Sinai and should not be confused with the English word sin
02Ex 17:2 So once more the people complained against Moses. "Give us water to drink!" they demanded. "Quiet!" Moses replied. "Why are you complaining against me? And why are you testing the LORD?"
02Ex 17:3 But tormented by thirst, they continued to argue with Moses. "Why did you bring us out of Egypt? Are you trying to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"
02Ex 17:4 Then Moses cried out to the LORD, "What should I do with these people? They are ready to stone me!"
02Ex 17:5 The LORD said to Moses, "Walk out in front of the people. Take your staff, the one you used when you struck the water of the Nile, and call some of the elders of Israel to join you.
02Ex 17:6 I will stand before you on the rock at Mount Sinai��. Strike the rock, and water will come gushing out. Then the people will be able to drink." So Moses struck the rock as he was told, and water gushed out as the elders looked on. / ��Hebrew Horeb, another name for Sinai
02Ex 17:7 Moses named the place Massah (which means "test") and Meribah (which means "arguing") because the people of Israel argued with Moses and tested the LORD by saying, "Is the LORD here with us or not?"
02Ex 17:8 While the people of Israel were still at Rephidim, the warriors of Amalek attacked them.
02Ex 17:9 Moses commanded Joshua, "Choose some men to go out and fight the army of Amalek for us. Tomorrow, I will stand at the top of the hill, holding the staff of God in my hand."
02Ex 17:10 So Joshua did what Moses had commanded and fought the army of Amalek. Meanwhile, Moses, Aaron, and Hur climbed to the top of a nearby hill.
02Ex 17:11 As long as Moses held up the staff in his hand, the Israelites had the advantage. But whenever he dropped his hand, the Amalekites gained the advantage.
02Ex 17:12 Moses' arms soon became so tired he could no longer hold them up. So Aaron and Hur found a stone for him to sit on. Then they stood on each side of Moses, holding up his hands. So his hands held steady until sunset.
02Ex 17:13 As a result, Joshua overwhelmed the army of Amalek in battle.
02Ex 17:14 After the victory, the LORD instructed Moses, "Write this down on a scroll as a permanent reminder, and read it aloud to Joshua�� I will erase the memory of Amalek from under heaven."
02Ex 17:15 Moses built an altar there and named it Yahweh-nissi (which means "the LORD is my banner").
02Ex 17:16 He said, "They have raised their fist against the LORD's throne, so now�� the LORD will be at war with Amalek generation after generation." / ��Or Hands have been lifted up to the LORD's throne, and now
02Ex 18:1 Moses' father-in-law, Jethro, the priest of Midian, heard about everything God had done for Moses and his people, the Israelites. He heard especially about how the LORD had rescued them from Egypt.
02Ex 18:2 Earlier, Moses had sent his wife, Zipporah, and his two sons back to Jethro, who had taken them in.
02Ex 18:3 (Moses' first son was named Gershom��, for Moses had said when the boy was born, "I have been a foreigner in a foreign land." / ��Gershom sounds like a Hebrew term that means "a foreigner there"
02Ex 18:4 His second son was named Eliezer��, for Moses had said, "The God of my ancestors was my helper; he rescued me from the sword of Pharaoh.") / ��Eliezer means "God is my helper"
02Ex 18:5 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, now came to visit Moses in the wilderness. He brought Moses' wife and two sons with him, and they arrived while Moses and the people were camped near the mountain of God.
02Ex 18:6 Jethro had sent a message to Moses, saying, "I, Jethro, your father-in-law, am coming to see you with your wife and your two sons."
02Ex 18:7 So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law. He bowed low and kissed him. They asked about each other's welfare and then went into Moses' tent.
02Ex 18:8 Moses told his father-in-law everything the LORD had done to Pharaoh and Egypt on behalf of Israel. He also told about all the hardships they had experienced along the way and how the LORD had rescued his people from all their troubles.
02Ex 18:9 Jethro was delighted when he heard about all the good things the LORD had done for Israel as he rescued them from the hand of the Egyptians.
02Ex 18:10 "Praise the LORD," Jethro said, "for he has rescued you from the Egyptians and from Pharaoh. Yes, he has rescued Israel from the powerful hand of Egypt!
02Ex 18:11 I know now that the LORD is greater than all other gods, because he rescued his people from the oppression of the proud Egyptians."
02Ex 18:12 Then Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices to God. Aaron and all the elders of Israel came out and joined him in a sacrificial meal in God's presence.
02Ex 18:13 The next day, Moses took his seat to hear the people's disputes against each other. They waited before him from morning till evening.
02Ex 18:14 When Moses' father-in-law saw all that Moses was doing for the people, he asked, "What are you really accomplishing here? Why are you trying to do all this alone while everyone stands around you from morning till evening?"
02Ex 18:15 Moses replied, "Because the people come to me to get a ruling from God.
02Ex 18:16 When a dispute arises, they come to me, and I am the one who settles the case between the quarreling parties. I inform the people of God's decrees and give them his instructions."
02Ex 18:17 "This is not good!" Moses' father-in-law exclaimed.
02Ex 18:18 "You're going to wear yourself out - and the people, too. This job is too heavy a burden for you to handle all by yourself.
02Ex 18:19 Now listen to me, and let me give you a word of advice, and may God be with you. You should continue to be the people's representative before God, bringing their disputes to him.
02Ex 18:20 Teach them God's decrees, and give them his instructions. Show them how to conduct their lives.
02Ex 18:21 But select from all the people some capable, honest men who fear God and hate bribes. Appoint them as leaders over groups of one thousand, one hundred, fifty, and ten.
02Ex 18:22 They should always be available to solve the people's common disputes, but have them bring the major cases to you. Let the leaders decide the smaller matters themselves. They will help you carry the load, making the task easier for you.
02Ex 18:23 If you follow this advice, and if God commands you to do so, then you will be able to endure the pressures, and all these people will go home in peace."
02Ex 18:24 Moses listened to his father-in-law's advice and followed his suggestions.
02Ex 18:25 He chose capable men from all over Israel and appointed them as leaders over the people. He put them in charge of groups of one thousand, one hundred, fifty, and ten.
02Ex 18:26 These men were always available to solve the people's common disputes. They brought the major cases to Moses, but they took care of the smaller matters themselves.
02Ex 18:27 Soon after this, Moses said good-bye to his father-in-law, who returned to his own land.
02Ex 19:1 Exactly two months after the Israelites left Egypt��, they arrived in the wilderness of Sinai. / ��Hebrew In the third month after the Israelites left Egypt, on the very day, i.e., two lunar months to the day after leaving Egypt. Compare Num 33.3
02Ex 19:2 After breaking camp at Rephidim, they came to the wilderness of Sinai and set up camp there at the base of Mount Sinai.
02Ex 19:3 Then Moses climbed the mountain to appear before God. The LORD called to him from the mountain and said, "Give these instructions to the family of Jacob; announce it to the descendants of Israel.
02Ex 19:4 'You have seen what I did to the Egyptians. You know how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself.
02Ex 19:5 Now if you will obey me and keep my covenant, you will be my own special treasure from among all the peoples on earth; for all the earth belongs to me.
02Ex 19:6 And you will be my kingdom of priests, my holy nation.' This is the message you must give to the people of Israel."
02Ex 19:7 So Moses returned from the mountain and called together the elders of the people and told them everything the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 19:8 And all the people responded together, "We will do everything the LORD has commanded." So Moses brought the people's answer back to the LORD.
02Ex 19:9 Then the LORD said to Moses, "I will come to you in a thick cloud, Moses, so the people themselves can hear me when I speak with you. Then they will always trust you." Moses told the LORD what the people had said.
02Ex 19:10 Then the LORD told Moses, "Go down and prepare the people for my arrival. Consecrate them today and tomorrow, and have them wash their clothing.
02Ex 19:11 Be sure they are ready on the third day, for on that day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai as all the people watch.
02Ex 19:12 Mark off a boundary all around the mountain. Warn the people, 'Be careful! Do not go up on the mountain or even touch its boundaries. Anyone who touches the mountain will certainly be put to death.
02Ex 19:13 No hand may touch the person or animal that crosses the boundary; instead, stone them or shoot them with arrows. They must be put to death.' However, when the ram's horn sounds a long blast, then the people may go up on the mountain��." / ��Or up to the mountain
02Ex 19:14 So Moses went down to the people. He consecrated them for worship, and they washed their clothes.
02Ex 19:15 He told them, "Get ready for the third day, and until then abstain from having sexual intercourse."
02Ex 19:16 On the morning of the third day, thunder roared and lightning flashed, and a dense cloud came down on the mountain. There was a long, loud blast from a ram's horn, and all the people trembled.
02Ex 19:17 Moses led them out from the camp to meet with God, and they stood at the foot of the mountain.
02Ex 19:18 All of Mount Sinai was covered with smoke because the LORD had descended on it in the form of fire. The smoke billowed into the sky like smoke from a brick kiln, and the whole mountain shook violently.
02Ex 19:19 As the blast of the ram's horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke, and God thundered his reply.
02Ex 19:20 The LORD came down on the top of Mount Sinai and called Moses to the top of the mountain. So Moses climbed the mountain.
02Ex 19:21 Then the LORD told Moses, "Go back down and warn the people not to break through the boundaries to see the LORD, or they will die.
02Ex 19:22 Even the priests who regularly come near to the LORD must purify themselves so that the LORD does not break out and destroy them."
02Ex 19:23 "But LORD," Moses protested, "the people cannot come up to Mount Sinai. You already warned us. You told me, 'Mark off a boundary all around the mountain to set it apart as holy.'"
02Ex 19:24 But the LORD said, "Go down and bring Aaron back up with you. In the meantime, do not let the priests or the people break through to approach the LORD, or he will break out and destroy them."
02Ex 19:25 So Moses went down to the people and told them what the LORD had said.
02Ex 20:1 Then God gave the people all these instructions��. / ��Hebrew all these words
02Ex 20:2 "I am the LORD your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt, the place of your slavery.
02Ex 20:3 "You must not have any other god but me.
02Ex 20:4 "You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea.
02Ex 20:5 You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected - even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me.
02Ex 20:6 But I lavish unfailing love for a thousand generations on those�� who love me and obey my commands. / ��Hebrew for thousands of those
02Ex 20:7 "You must not misuse the name of the LORD your God. The LORD will not let you go unpunished if you misuse his name.
02Ex 20:8 "Remember to observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy.
02Ex 20:9 You have six days each week for your ordinary work,
02Ex 20:10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of rest dedicated to the LORD your God. On that day no one in your household may do any work. This includes you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, your livestock, and any foreigners living among you.
02Ex 20:11 For in six days the LORD made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and everything in them; but on the seventh day he rested. That is why the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart as holy.
02Ex 20:12 "Honor your father and mother. Then you will live a long, full life in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
02Ex 20:13 "You must not murder.

02Ex 20:17 "You must not covet your neighbor's house. You must not covet your neighbor's wife, male or female servant, ox or donkey, or anything else that belongs to your neighbor."
02Ex 20:18 When the people heard the thunder and the loud blast of the ram's horn, and when they saw the flashes of lightning and the smoke billowing from the mountain, they stood at a distance, trembling with fear.
02Ex 20:19 And they said to Moses, "You speak to us, and we will listen. But don't let God speak directly to us, or we will die!"
02Ex 20:20 "Don't be afraid," Moses answered them, "for God has come in this way to test you, and so that your fear of him will keep you from sinning!"
02Ex 20:21 As the people stood in the distance, Moses approached the dark cloud where God was.
02Ex 20:22 And the LORD said to Moses, "Say this to the people of Israel�� You saw for yourselves that I spoke to you from heaven.
02Ex 20:23 Remember, you must not make any idols of silver or gold to rival me.
02Ex 20:24 "Build for me an altar made of earth, and offer your sacrifices to me - your burnt offerings and peace offerings, your sheep and goats, and your cattle. Build my altar wherever I cause my name to be remembered, and I will come to you and bless you.
02Ex 20:25 If you use stones to build my altar, use only natural, uncut stones. Do not shape the stones with a tool, for that would make the altar unfit for holy use.
02Ex 20:26 And do not approach my altar by going up steps. If you do, someone might look up under your clothing and see your nakedness.
02Ex 21:1 "These are the regulations you must present to Israel.
02Ex 21:2 "If you buy a Hebrew slave, he may serve for no more than six years. Set him free in the seventh year, and he will owe you nothing for his freedom.
02Ex 21:3 If he was single when he became your slave, he shall leave single. But if he was married before he became a slave, then his wife must be freed with him.
02Ex 21:4 "If his master gave him a wife while he was a slave and they had sons or daughters, then only the man will be free in the seventh year, but his wife and children will still belong to his master.
02Ex 21:5 But the slave may declare, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children. I don't want to go free.'

02Ex 21:7 "When a man sells his daughter as a slave, she will not be freed at the end of six years as the men are.
02Ex 21:8 If she does not satisfy her owner, he must allow her to be bought back again. But he is not allowed to sell her to foreigners, since he is the one who broke the contract with her.
02Ex 21:9 But if the slave's owner arranges for her to marry his son, he may no longer treat her as a slave but as a daughter.
02Ex 21:10 "If a man who has married a slave wife takes another wife for himself, he must not neglect the rights of the first wife to food, clothing, and sexual intimacy.

02Ex 21:12 "Anyone who assaults and kills another person must be put to death.
02Ex 21:13 But if it was simply an accident permitted by God, I will appoint a place of refuge where the slayer can run for safety.

02Ex 24:2 Only Moses is allowed to come near to the LORD. The others must not come near, and none of the other people are allowed to climb up the mountain with him."
02Ex 24:3 Then Moses went down to the people and repeated all the instructions and regulations the LORD had given him. All the people answered with one voice, "We will do everything the LORD has commanded."
02Ex 24:4 Then Moses carefully wrote down all the LORD's instructions. Early the next morning Moses got up and built an altar at the foot of the mountain. He also set up twelve pillars, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel.
02Ex 24:5 Then he sent some of the young Israelite men to present burnt offerings and to sacrifice bulls as peace offerings to the LORD.
02Ex 24:6 Moses drained half the blood from these animals into basins. The other half he splattered against the altar.
02Ex 24:7 Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it aloud to the people. Again they all responded, "We will do everything the LORD has commanded. We will obey."
02Ex 24:8 Then Moses took the blood from the basins and splattered it over the people, declaring, "Look, this blood confirms the covenant the LORD has made with you in giving you these instructions."
02Ex 24:9 Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, Abihu, and the seventy elders of Israel climbed up the mountain.
02Ex 24:10 There they saw the God of Israel. Under his feet there seemed to be a surface of brilliant blue lapis lazuli, as clear as the sky itself.
02Ex 24:11 And though these nobles of Israel gazed upon God, he did not destroy them. In fact, they ate a covenant meal, eating and drinking in his presence!
02Ex 24:12 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Come up to me on the mountain. Stay there, and I will give you the tablets of stone on which I have inscribed the instructions and commands so you can teach the people."
02Ex 24:13 So Moses and his assistant Joshua set out, and Moses climbed up the mountain of God.
02Ex 24:14 Moses told the elders, "Stay here and wait for us until we come back. Aaron and Hur are here with you. If anyone has a dispute while I am gone, consult with them."
02Ex 24:15 Then Moses climbed up the mountain, and the cloud covered it.
02Ex 24:16 And the glory of the LORD settled down on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day the LORD called to Moses from inside the cloud.
02Ex 24:17 To the Israelites at the foot of the mountain, the glory of the LORD appeared at the summit like a consuming fire.
02Ex 24:18 Then Moses disappeared into the cloud as he climbed higher up the mountain. He remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights.
02Ex 25:1 The LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 25:2 "Tell the people of Israel to bring me their sacred offerings. Accept the contributions from all whose hearts are moved to offer them.

02Ex 30:22 Then the LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 30:23 "Collect choice spices - 12 1/2 pounds of pure myrrh, 6 1/4 pounds of fragrant cinnamon, 6 1/4 pounds of fragrant calamus��, / ��Hebrew 500 shekels [5.7 kilograms] of pure myrrh, 250 shekels [2.9 kilograms] of fragrant cinnamon, 250 shekels of fragrant calamus
02Ex 30:24 and 12 1/2 pounds of cassia�� - as measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel. Also get one gallon of olive oil��. / ��Hebrew 500 shekels [5.7 kilograms] of cassia ��Hebrew 1 hin [3.8 liters] of olive oil
02Ex 30:25 Like a skilled incense maker, blend these ingredients to make a holy anointing oil.
02Ex 30:26 Use this sacred oil to anoint the Tabernacle, the Ark of the Covenant,
02Ex 30:27 the table and all its utensils, the lampstand and all its accessories, the incense altar,
02Ex 30:28 the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and the washbasin with its stand.
02Ex 30:29 Consecrate them to make them absolutely holy. After this, whatever touches them will also become holy.
02Ex 30:30 "Anoint Aaron and his sons also, consecrating them to serve me as priests.
02Ex 30:31 And say to the people of Israel, 'This holy anointing oil is reserved for me from generation to generation.
02Ex 30:32 It must never be used to anoint anyone else, and you must never make any blend like it for yourselves. It is holy, and you must treat it as holy.
02Ex 30:33 Anyone who makes a blend like it or anoints someone other than a priest will be cut off from the community.'"
02Ex 30:34 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Gather fragrant spices - resin droplets, mollusk shell, and galbanum - and mix these fragrant spices with pure frankincense, weighed out in equal amounts.
02Ex 30:35 Using the usual techniques of the incense maker, blend the spices together and sprinkle them with salt to produce a pure and holy incense.
02Ex 30:36 Grind some of the mixture into a very fine powder and put it in front of the Ark of the Covenant��, where I will meet with you in the Tabernacle. You must treat this incense as most holy. / ��Hebrew in front of the Testimony; see note on 25.16
02Ex 30:37 Never use this formula to make this incense for yourselves. It is reserved for the LORD, and you must treat it as holy.
02Ex 30:38 Anyone who makes incense like this for personal use will be cut off from the community."
02Ex 31:1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 31:2 "Look, I have specifically chosen Bezalel son of Uri, grandson of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
02Ex 31:3 I have filled him with the Spirit of God, giving him great wisdom, ability, and expertise in all kinds of crafts.
02Ex 31:4 He is a master craftsman, expert in working with gold, silver, and bronze.
02Ex 31:5 He is skilled in engraving and mounting gemstones and in carving wood. He is a master at every craft!
02Ex 31:6 "And I have personally appointed Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, to be his assistant. Moreover, I have given special skill to all the gifted craftsmen so they can make all the things I have commanded you to make.
02Ex 31:7 the Tabernacle��; the Ark of the Covenant��; the Ark's cover - the place of atonement; all the furnishings of the Tabernacle; / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting ��Hebrew the Ark of the Testimony
02Ex 31:8 the table and its utensils; the pure gold lampstand with all its accessories; the incense altar;
02Ex 31:9 the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils; the washbasin with its stand;
02Ex 31:10 the beautifully stitched garments - the sacred garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to wear as they minister as priests;
02Ex 31:11 the anointing oil; the fragrant incense for the Holy Place. The craftsmen must make everything as I have commanded you."
02Ex 31:12 The LORD then gave these instructions to Moses.
02Ex 31:13 "Tell the people of Israel�� 'Be careful to keep my Sabbath day, for the Sabbath is a sign of the covenant between me and you from generation to generation. It is given so you may know that I am the LORD, who makes you holy.
02Ex 31:14 You must keep the Sabbath day, for it is a holy day for you. Anyone who desecrates it must be put to death; anyone who works on that day will be cut off from the community.
02Ex 31:15 You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but the seventh day must be a Sabbath day of complete rest, a holy day dedicated to the LORD. Anyone who works on the Sabbath must be put to death.
02Ex 31:16 The people of Israel must keep the Sabbath day by observing it from generation to generation. This is a covenant obligation for all time.
02Ex 31:17 It is a permanent sign of my covenant with the people of Israel. For in six days the LORD made heaven and earth, but on the seventh day he stopped working and was refreshed.'"
02Ex 31:18 When the LORD finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant��, written by the finger of God. / ��Hebrew the two tablets of the Testimony; see note on 25.16
02Ex 32:1 When the people saw how long it was taking Moses to come back down the mountain, they gathered around Aaron. "Come on," they said, "make us some gods who can lead us. We don't know what happened to this fellow Moses, who brought us here from the land of Egypt."
02Ex 32:2 So Aaron said, "Take the gold rings from the ears of your wives and sons and daughters, and bring them to me."
02Ex 32:3 All the people took the gold rings from their ears and brought them to Aaron.
02Ex 32:4 Then Aaron took the gold, melted it down, and molded it into the shape of a calf. When the people saw it, they exclaimed, "O Israel, these are the gods who brought you out of the land of Egypt!"
02Ex 32:5 Aaron saw how excited the people were, so he built an altar in front of the calf. Then he announced, "Tomorrow will be a festival to the LORD!"
02Ex 32:6 The people got up early the next morning to sacrifice burnt offerings and peace offerings. After this, they celebrated with feasting and drinking, and they indulged in pagan revelry.
02Ex 32:7 The LORD told Moses, "Quick! Go down the mountain! Your people whom you brought from the land of Egypt have corrupted themselves.
02Ex 32:8 How quickly they have turned away from the way I commanded them to live! They have melted down gold and made a calf, and they have bowed down and sacrificed to it. They are saying, 'These are your gods, O Israel, who brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"
02Ex 32:9 Then the LORD said, "I have seen how stubborn and rebellious these people are.
02Ex 32:10 Now leave me alone so my fierce anger can blaze against them, and I will destroy them. Then I will make you, Moses, into a great nation."
02Ex 32:11 But Moses tried to pacify the LORD his God. "O LORD!" he said. "Why are you so angry with your own people whom you brought from the land of Egypt with such great power and such a strong hand?
02Ex 32:12 Why let the Egyptians say, 'Their God rescued them with the evil intention of slaughtering them in the mountains and wiping them from the face of the earth'? Turn away from your fierce anger. Change your mind about this terrible disaster you have threatened against your people!
02Ex 32:13 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob��. You bound yourself with an oath to them, saying, 'I will make your descendants as numerous as the stars of heaven. And I will give them all of this land that I have promised to your descendants, and they will possess it forever.'" / ��Hebrew Israel. The names "Jacob" and "Israel" are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation
02Ex 32:14 So the LORD changed his mind about the terrible disaster he had threatened to bring on his people.
02Ex 32:15 Then Moses turned and went down the mountain. He held in his hands the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant��. They were inscribed on both sides, front and back. / ��Hebrew the two tablets of the Testimony; see note on 25.16
02Ex 32:16 These tablets were God's work; the words on them were written by God himself.
02Ex 32:17 When Joshua heard the boisterous noise of the people shouting below them, he exclaimed to Moses, "It sounds like war in the camp!"
02Ex 32:18 But Moses replied, "No, it's not a shout of victory nor the wailing of defeat. I hear the sound of a celebration."
02Ex 32:19 When they came near the camp, Moses saw the calf and the dancing, and he burned with anger. He threw the stone tablets to the ground, smashing them at the foot of the mountain.
02Ex 32:20 He took the calf they had made and burned it. Then he ground it into powder, threw it into the water, and forced the people to drink it.
02Ex 32:21 Finally, he turned to Aaron and demanded, "What did these people do to you to make you bring such terrible sin upon them?"
02Ex 32:22 "Don't get so upset, my lord," Aaron replied. "You yourself know how evil these people are.
02Ex 32:23 They said to me, 'Make us gods who will lead us. We don't know what happened to this fellow Moses, who brought us here from the land of Egypt.'
02Ex 32:24 So I told them, 'Whoever has gold jewelry, take it off.' When they brought it to me, I simply threw it into the fire - and out came this calf!"
02Ex 32:25 Moses saw that Aaron had let the people get completely out of control, much to the amusement of their enemies��. / ��Or out of control, and they mocked anyone who opposed them. The meaning of the Hebrew is unclear
02Ex 32:26 So he stood at the entrance to the camp and shouted, "All of you who are on the LORD's side, come here and join me." And all the Levites gathered around him.
02Ex 32:27 Moses told them, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says�� Each of you, take your swords and go back and forth from one end of the camp to the other. Kill everyone - even your brothers, friends, and neighbors."
02Ex 32:28 The Levites obeyed Moses' command, and about 3,000 people died that day.
02Ex 32:29 Then Moses told the Levites, "Today you have ordained yourselves�� for the service of the LORD, for you obeyed him even though it meant killing your own sons and brothers. Today you have earned a blessing." / ��As in Greek and Latin versions; Hebrew reads Today ordain yourselves
02Ex 32:30 The next day Moses said to the people, "You have committed a terrible sin, but I will go back up to the LORD on the mountain. Perhaps I will be able to obtain forgiveness�� for your sin." / ��Or to make atonement
02Ex 32:31 So Moses returned to the LORD and said, "Oh, what a terrible sin these people have committed. They have made gods of gold for themselves.
02Ex 32:32 But now, if you will only forgive their sin - but if not, erase my name from the record you have written!"
02Ex 32:33 But the LORD replied to Moses, "No, I will erase the name of everyone who has sinned against me.
02Ex 32:34 Now go, lead the people to the place I told you about. Look! My angel will lead the way before you. And when I come to call the people to account, I will certainly hold them responsible for their sins."
02Ex 32:35 Then the LORD sent a great plague upon the people because they had worshiped the calf Aaron had made.
02Ex 33:1 The LORD said to Moses, "Get going, you and the people you brought up from the land of Egypt. Go up to the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. I told them, 'I will give this land to your descendants.'
02Ex 33:2 And I will send an angel before you to drive out the Canaanites, Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
02Ex 33:3 Go up to this land that flows with milk and honey. But I will not travel among you, for you are a stubborn and rebellious people. If I did, I would surely destroy you along the way."
02Ex 33:4 When the people heard these stern words, they went into mourning and stopped wearing their jewelry and fine clothes.
02Ex 33:5 For the LORD had told Moses to tell them, "You are a stubborn and rebellious people. If I were to travel with you for even a moment, I would destroy you. Remove your jewelry and fine clothes while I decide what to do with you."
02Ex 33:6 So from the time they left Mount Sinai��, the Israelites wore no more jewelry or fine clothes. / ��Hebrew Horeb, another name for Sinai
02Ex 33:7 It was Moses' practice to take the Tent of Meeting�� and set it up some distance from the camp. Everyone who wanted to make a request of the LORD would go to the Tent of Meeting outside the camp. / ��This "Tent of Meeting" is different from the Tabernacle described in chapters 26 and 36
02Ex 33:8 Whenever Moses went out to the Tent of Meeting, all the people would get up and stand in the entrances of their own tents. They would all watch Moses until he disappeared inside.
02Ex 33:9 As he went into the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and hover at its entrance while the LORD spoke with Moses.
02Ex 33:10 When the people saw the cloud standing at the entrance of the tent, they would stand and bow down in front of their own tents.
02Ex 33:11 Inside the Tent of Meeting, the LORD would speak to Moses face to face, as one speaks to a friend. Afterward Moses would return to the camp, but the young man who assisted him, Joshua son of Nun, would remain behind in the Tent of Meeting.
02Ex 33:12 One day Moses said to the LORD, "You have been telling me, 'Take these people up to the Promised Land.' But you haven't told me whom you will send with me. You have told me, 'I know you by name, and I look favorably on you.'
02Ex 33:13 If it is true that you look favorably on me, let me know your ways so I may understand you more fully and continue to enjoy your favor. And remember that this nation is your very own people."
02Ex 33:14 The LORD replied, "I will personally go with you, Moses, and I will give you rest - everything will be fine for you."
02Ex 33:15 Then Moses said, "If you don't personally go with us, don't make us leave this place.
02Ex 33:16 How will anyone know that you look favorably on me - on me and on your people - if you don't go with us? For your presence among us sets your people and me apart from all other people on the earth."
02Ex 33:17 The LORD replied to Moses, "I will indeed do what you have asked, for I look favorably on you, and I know you by name."
02Ex 33:18 Moses responded, "Then show me your glorious presence."
02Ex 33:19 The LORD replied, "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and I will call out my name, Yahweh��, before you. For I will show mercy to anyone I choose, and I will show compassion to anyone I choose. / ��Yahweh is a transliteration of the proper name YHWH that is sometimes rendered "Jehovah"; in this translation it is usually rendered "the LORD" (note the use of small capitals)
02Ex 33:20 But you may not look directly at my face, for no one may see me and live."
02Ex 33:21 The LORD continued, "Look, stand near me on this rock.
02Ex 33:22 As my glorious presence passes by, I will hide you in the crevice of the rock and cover you with my hand until I have passed by.
02Ex 33:23 Then I will remove my hand and let you see me from behind. But my face will not be seen."
02Ex 34:1 Then the LORD told Moses, "Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones. I will write on them the same words that were on the tablets you smashed.
02Ex 34:2 Be ready in the morning to climb up Mount Sinai and present yourself to me on the top of the mountain.
02Ex 34:3 No one else may come with you. In fact, no one is to appear anywhere on the mountain. Do not even let the flocks or herds graze near the mountain."
02Ex 34:4 So Moses chiseled out two tablets of stone like the first ones. Early in the morning he climbed Mount Sinai as the LORD had commanded him, and he carried the two stone tablets in his hands.
02Ex 34:5 Then the LORD came down in a cloud and stood there with him; and he called out his own name, Yahweh��. / ��Yahweh is a transliteration of the proper name YHWH that is sometimes rendered "Jehovah"; in this translation it is usually rendered "the LORD" (note the use of small capitals)
02Ex 34:6 The LORD passed in front of Moses, calling out, "Yahweh! The LORD! The God of compassion and mercy! I am slow to anger and filled with unfailing love and faithfulness.
02Ex 34:7 I lavish unfailing love to a thousand generations��. I forgive iniquity, rebellion, and sin. But I do not excuse the guilty. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children and grandchildren; the entire family is affected - even children in the third and fourth generations."  / ��Hebrew for thousands
02Ex 34:8 Moses immediately threw himself to the ground and worshiped.
02Ex 34:9 And he said, "O Lord, if it is true that I have found favor with you, then please travel with us. Yes, this is a stubborn and rebellious people, but please forgive our iniquity and our sins. Claim us as your own special possession."
02Ex 34:10 The LORD replied, "Listen, I am making a covenant with you in the presence of all your people. I will perform miracles that have never been performed anywhere in all the earth or in any nation. And all the people around you will see the power of the LORD - the awesome power I will display for you.
02Ex 34:11 But listen carefully to everything I command you today. Then I will go ahead of you and drive out the Amorites, Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
02Ex 34:12 "Be very careful never to make a treaty with the people who live in the land where you are going. If you do, you will follow their evil ways and be trapped.
02Ex 34:13 Instead, you must break down their pagan altars, smash their sacred pillars, and cut down their Asherah poles.
02Ex 34:14 You must worship no other gods, for the LORD, whose very name is Jealous, is a God who is jealous about his relationship with you.
02Ex 34:15 "You must not make a treaty of any kind with the people living in the land. They lust after their gods, offering sacrifices to them. They will invite you to join them in their sacrificial meals, and you will go with them.
02Ex 34:16 Then you will accept their daughters, who sacrifice to other gods, as wives for your sons. And they will seduce your sons to commit adultery against me by worshiping other gods.
02Ex 34:17 You must not make any gods of molten metal for yourselves.
02Ex 34:18 "You must celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast, just as I commanded you. Celebrate this festival annually at the appointed time in early spring, in the month of Abib��, for that is the anniversary of your departure from Egypt. / ��Hebrew appointed time in the month of Abib. This first month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of March and April
02Ex 34:19 "The firstborn of every animal belongs to me, including the firstborn males from your herds of cattle and your flocks of sheep and goats.
02Ex 34:20 A firstborn donkey may be bought back from the LORD by presenting a lamb or young goat in its place. But if you do not buy it back, you must break its neck. However, you must buy back every firstborn son. "No one may appear before me without an offering.
02Ex 34:21 "You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but on the seventh day you must stop working, even during the seasons of plowing and harvest.
02Ex 34:22 "You must celebrate the Festival of Harvest�� with the first crop of the wheat harvest, and celebrate the Festival of the Final Harvest�� at the end of the harvest season. / ��Hebrew Festival of Weeks; compare 23.16. This was later called the Festival of Pentecost. It is celebrated today as Shavuat (or Shabuoth) ��Or Festival of Ingathering. This was later called the Festival of Shelters or Festival of Tabernacles (see Lev 23.33-36). It is celebrated today as Sukkot (or Succoth)
02Ex 34:23 Three times each year every man in Israel must appear before the Sovereign, the LORD, the God of Israel.
02Ex 34:24 I will drive out the other nations ahead of you and expand your territory, so no one will covet and conquer your land while you appear before the LORD your God three times each year.
02Ex 34:25 "You must not offer the blood of my sacrificial offerings together with any baked goods containing yeast. And none of the meat of the Passover sacrifice may be kept over until the next morning.
02Ex 34:26 "As you harvest your crops, bring the very best of the first harvest to the house of the LORD your God. "You must not cook a young goat in its mother's milk."
02Ex 34:27 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Write down all these instructions, for they represent the terms of the covenant I am making with you and with Israel."
02Ex 34:28 Moses remained there on the mountain with the LORD forty days and forty nights. In all that time he ate no bread and drank no water. And the LORD�� wrote the terms of the covenant - the Ten Commandments�� - on the stone tablets. / ��Hebrew he ��Hebrew the ten words
02Ex 34:29 When Moses came down Mount Sinai carrying the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant��, he wasn't aware that his face had become radiant because he had spoken to the LORD. / ��Hebrew the two tablets of the Testimony; see note on 25.16
02Ex 34:30 So when Aaron and the people of Israel saw the radiance of Moses' face, they were afraid to come near him.
02Ex 34:31 But Moses called out to them and asked Aaron and all the leaders of the community to come over, and he talked with them.
02Ex 34:32 Then all the people of Israel approached him, and Moses gave them all the instructions the LORD had given him on Mount Sinai.
02Ex 34:33 When Moses finished speaking with them, he covered his face with a veil.
02Ex 34:34 But whenever he went into the Tent of Meeting to speak with the LORD, he would remove the veil until he came out again. Then he would give the people whatever instructions the LORD had given him,
02Ex 34:35 and the people of Israel would see the radiant glow of his face. So he would put the veil over his face until he returned to speak with the LORD.
02Ex 35:1 Then Moses called together the whole community of Israel and told them, "These are the instructions the LORD has commanded you to follow.
02Ex 35:2 You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but the seventh day must be a Sabbath day of complete rest, a holy day dedicated to the LORD. Anyone who works on that day must be put to death.
02Ex 35:3 You must not even light a fire in any of your homes on the Sabbath."
02Ex 35:4 Then Moses said to the whole community of Israel, "This is what the LORD has commanded.
02Ex 35:5 Take a sacred offering for the LORD. Let those with generous hearts present the following gifts to the LORD�� gold, silver, and bronze;
02Ex 35:6 blue, purple, and scarlet thread; fine linen and goat hair for cloth;
02Ex 35:7 tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather; acacia wood;
02Ex 35:8 olive oil for the lamps; spices for the anointing oil and the fragrant incense;
02Ex 35:9 onyx stones, and other gemstones to be set in the ephod and the priest's chestpiece.
02Ex 35:10 "Come, all of you who are gifted craftsmen. Construct everything that the LORD has commanded.
02Ex 35:11 the Tabernacle and its sacred tent, its covering, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases;
02Ex 35:12 the Ark and its carrying poles; the Ark's cover - the place of atonement; the inner curtain to shield the Ark;
02Ex 35:13 the table, its carrying poles, and all its utensils; the Bread of the Presence;
02Ex 35:14 for light, the lampstand, its accessories, the lamp cups, and the olive oil for lighting;
02Ex 35:15 the incense altar and its carrying poles; the anointing oil and fragrant incense; the curtain for the entrance of the Tabernacle;
02Ex 35:16 the altar of burnt offering; the bronze grating of the altar and its carrying poles and utensils; the washbasin with its stand;
02Ex 35:17 the curtains for the walls of the courtyard; the posts and their bases; the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard;
02Ex 35:18 the tent pegs of the Tabernacle and courtyard and their ropes;
02Ex 35:19 the beautifully stitched garments for the priests to wear while ministering in the Holy Place - the sacred garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to wear as they minister as priests."
02Ex 35:20 So the whole community of Israel left Moses and returned to their tents.
02Ex 35:21 All whose hearts were stirred and whose spirits were moved came and brought their sacred offerings to the LORD. They brought all the materials needed for the Tabernacle��, for the performance of its rituals, and for the sacred garments. / ��Hebrew Tent of Meeting
02Ex 35:22 Both men and women came, all whose hearts were willing. They brought to the LORD their offerings of gold - brooches, earrings, rings from their fingers, and necklaces. They presented gold objects of every kind as a special offering to the LORD.
02Ex 35:23 All those who owned the following items willingly brought them�� blue, purple, and scarlet thread; fine linen and goat hair for cloth; and tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather.
02Ex 35:24 And all who had silver and bronze objects gave them as a sacred offering to the LORD. And those who had acacia wood brought it for use in the project.
02Ex 35:25 All the women who were skilled in sewing and spinning prepared blue, purple, and scarlet thread, and fine linen cloth.
02Ex 35:26 All the women who were willing used their skills to spin the goat hair into yarn.
02Ex 35:27 The leaders brought onyx stones and the special gemstones to be set in the ephod and the priest's chestpiece.
02Ex 35:28 They also brought spices and olive oil for the light, the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense.
02Ex 35:29 So the people of Israel - every man and woman who was eager to help in the work the LORD had given them through Moses - brought their gifts and gave them freely to the LORD.
02Ex 35:30 Then Moses told the people of Israel, "The LORD has specifically chosen Bezalel son of Uri, grandson of Hur, of the tribe of Judah.
02Ex 35:31 The LORD has filled Bezalel with the Spirit of God, giving him great wisdom, ability, and expertise in all kinds of crafts.
02Ex 35:32 He is a master craftsman, expert in working with gold, silver, and bronze.
02Ex 35:33 He is skilled in engraving and mounting gemstones and in carving wood. He is a master at every craft.
02Ex 35:34 And the LORD has given both him and Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, the ability to teach their skills to others.
02Ex 35:35 The LORD has given them special skills as engravers, designers, embroiderers in blue, purple, and scarlet thread on fine linen cloth, and weavers. They excel as craftsmen and as designers.
02Ex 36:1 "The LORD has gifted Bezalel, Oholiab, and the other skilled craftsmen with wisdom and ability to perform any task involved in building the sanctuary. Let them construct and furnish the Tabernacle, just as the LORD has commanded."
02Ex 36:2 So Moses summoned Bezalel and Oholiab and all the others who were specially gifted by the LORD and were eager to get to work.
02Ex 36:3 Moses gave them the materials donated by the people of Israel as sacred offerings for the completion of the sanctuary. But the people continued to bring additional gifts each morning.
02Ex 36:4 Finally the craftsmen who were working on the sanctuary left their work.
02Ex 36:5 They went to Moses and reported, "The people have given more than enough materials to complete the job the LORD has commanded us to do!"
02Ex 36:6 So Moses gave the command, and this message was sent throughout the camp�� "Men and women, don't prepare any more gifts for the sanctuary. We have enough!" So the people stopped bringing their sacred offerings.
02Ex 36:7 Their contributions were more than enough to complete the whole project.
02Ex 36:8 The skilled craftsmen made ten curtains of finely woven linen for the Tabernacle. Then Bezalel�� decorated the curtains with blue, purple, and scarlet thread and with skillfully embroidered cherubim. / ��Hebrew he; also in 36.16, 20, 35. See 37.1
02Ex 36:9 All ten curtains were exactly the same size - 42 feet long and 6 feet wide��. / ��Hebrew 28 cubits [12.9 meters] long and 4 cubits [1.8 meters] wide
02Ex 36:10 Five of these curtains were joined together to make one long curtain, and the other five were joined to make a second long curtain.
02Ex 36:11 He made fifty loops of blue yarn and put them along the edge of the last curtain in each set.
02Ex 36:12 The fifty loops along the edge of one curtain matched the fifty loops along the edge of the other curtain.
02Ex 36:13 Then he made fifty gold clasps and fastened the long curtains together with the clasps. In this way, the Tabernacle was made of one continuous piece.
02Ex 36:14 He made eleven curtains of goat-hair cloth to serve as a tent covering for the Tabernacle.
02Ex 36:15 These eleven curtains were all exactly the same size - 45 feet long and 6 feet wide��. / ��Hebrew 30 cubits [13.8 meters] long and 4 cubits [1.8 meters] wide
02Ex 36:16 Bezalel joined five of these curtains together to make one long curtain, and the other six were joined to make a second long curtain.
02Ex 36:17 He made fifty loops for the edge of each large curtain.
02Ex 36:18 He also made fifty bronze clasps to fasten the long curtains together. In this way, the tent covering was made of one continuous piece.
02Ex 36:19 He completed the tent covering with a layer of tanned ram skins and a layer of fine goatskin leather.
02Ex 36:20 For the framework of the Tabernacle, Bezalel constructed frames of acacia wood.
02Ex 36:21 Each frame was 15 feet high and 27 inches wide��, / ��Hebrew 10 cubits [4.6 meters] high and 1.5 cubits [69 centimeters] wide
02Ex 36:22 with two pegs under each frame. All the frames were identical.
02Ex 36:23 He made twenty of these frames to support the curtains on the south side of the Tabernacle.
02Ex 36:24 He also made forty silver bases - two bases under each frame, with the pegs fitting securely into the bases.
02Ex 36:25 For the north side of the Tabernacle, he made another twenty frames,
02Ex 36:26 with their forty silver bases, two bases under each frame.
02Ex 36:27 He made six frames for the rear - the west side of the Tabernacle - 
02Ex 36:28 along with two additional frames to reinforce the rear corners of the Tabernacle.
02Ex 36:29 These corner frames were matched at the bottom and firmly attached at the top with a single ring, forming a single corner unit. Both of these corner units were made the same way.
02Ex 36:30 So there were eight frames at the rear of the Tabernacle, set in sixteen silver bases - two bases under each frame.
02Ex 36:31 Then he made crossbars of acacia wood to link the frames, five crossbars for the north side of the Tabernacle
02Ex 36:32 and five for the south side. He also made five crossbars for the rear of the Tabernacle, which faced west.
02Ex 36:33 He made the middle crossbar to attach halfway up the frames; it ran all the way from one end of the Tabernacle to the other.
02Ex 36:34 He overlaid the frames with gold and made gold rings to hold the crossbars. Then he overlaid the crossbars with gold as well.
02Ex 36:35 For the inside of the Tabernacle, Bezalel made a special curtain of finely woven linen. He decorated it with blue, purple, and scarlet thread and with skillfully embroidered cherubim.
02Ex 36:36 For the curtain, he made four posts of acacia wood and four gold hooks. He overlaid the posts with gold and set them in four silver bases.
02Ex 36:37 Then he made another curtain for the entrance to the sacred tent. He made it of finely woven linen and embroidered it with exquisite designs using blue, purple, and scarlet thread.
02Ex 36:38 This curtain was hung on gold hooks attached to five posts. The posts with their decorated tops and hooks were overlaid with gold, and the five bases were cast from bronze.
02Ex 37:1 Next Bezalel made the Ark of acacia wood - a sacred chest 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27 inches high��. / ��Hebrew 2.5 cubits [115 centimeters] long, 1.5 cubits [69 centimeters] wide, and 1.5 cubits high
02Ex 37:2 He overlaid it inside and outside with pure gold, and he ran a molding of gold all around it.
02Ex 37:3 He cast four gold rings and attached them to its four feet, two rings on each side.
02Ex 37:4 Then he made poles from acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
02Ex 37:5 He inserted the poles into the rings at the sides of the Ark to carry it.
02Ex 37:6 Then he made the Ark's cover - the place of atonement - from pure gold. It was 45 inches long and 27 inches wide��. / ��Hebrew 2.5 cubits [115 centimeters] long and 1.5 cubits [69 centimeters] wide
02Ex 37:7 He made two cherubim from hammered gold and placed them on the two ends of the atonement cover.
02Ex 37:8 He molded the cherubim on each end of the atonement cover, making it all of one piece of gold.
02Ex 37:9 The cherubim faced each other and looked down on the atonement cover. With their wings spread above it, they protected it.
02Ex 37:10 Then Bezalel�� made the table of acacia wood, 36 inches long, 18 inches wide, and 27 inches high��. / ��Hebrew he; also in 37.17, 25 ��Hebrew 2 cubits [92 centimeters] long, 1 cubit [46 centimeters] wide, and 1.5 cubits [69 centimeters] high
02Ex 37:11 He overlaid it with pure gold and ran a gold molding around the edge.
02Ex 37:12 He decorated it with a 3-inch border�� all around, and he ran a gold molding along the border. / ��Hebrew a border of a handbreadth [8 centimeters]
02Ex 37:13 Then he cast four gold rings for the table and attached them at the four corners next to the four legs.
02Ex 37:14 The rings were attached near the border to hold the poles that were used to carry the table.
02Ex 37:15 He made these poles from acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
02Ex 37:16 Then he made special containers of pure gold for the table - bowls, pans, jars, and pitchers - to be used in pouring out liquid offerings.
02Ex 37:17 Then Bezalel made the lampstand of pure, hammered gold. He made the entire lampstand and its decorations of one piece - the base, center stem, lamp cups, buds, and petals.
02Ex 37:18 The lampstand had six branches going out from the center stem, three on each side.
02Ex 37:19 Each of the six branches had three lamp cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with buds and petals.
02Ex 37:20 The center stem of the lampstand was crafted with four lamp cups shaped like almond blossoms, complete with buds and petals.
02Ex 37:21 There was an almond bud beneath each pair of branches where the six branches extended from the center stem, all made of one piece.
02Ex 37:22 The almond buds and branches were all of one piece with the center stem, and they were hammered from pure gold.
02Ex 37:23 He also made seven lamps for the lampstand, lamp snuffers, and trays, all of pure gold.
02Ex 37:24 The entire lampstand, along with its accessories, was made from seventy-five pounds�� of pure gold. / ��Hebrew 1 talent [34 kilograms]
02Ex 37:25 Then Bezalel made the incense altar of acacia wood. It was 18 inches square and 36 inches high��, with horns at the corners carved from the same piece of wood as the altar itself. / ��Hebrew 1 cubit [46 centimeters] long and 1 cubit wide, a square, and 2 cubits [92 centimeters] high
02Ex 37:26 He overlaid the top, sides, and horns of the altar with pure gold, and he ran a gold molding around the entire altar.
02Ex 37:27 He made two gold rings and attached them on opposite sides of the altar below the gold molding to hold the carrying poles.
02Ex 37:28 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold.
02Ex 37:29 Then he made the sacred anointing oil and the fragrant incense, using the techniques of a skilled incense maker.
02Ex 38:1 Next Bezalel�� used acacia wood to construct the square altar of burnt offering. It was 7 1/2 feet wide, 7 1/2 feet long, and 4 1/2 feet high��. / ��Hebrew he; also in 38.8, 9 ��Hebrew 5 cubits [2.3 meters] wide, 5 cubits long, a square, and 3 cubits [1.4 meters] high
02Ex 38:2 He made horns for each of its four corners so that the horns and altar were all one piece. He overlaid the altar with bronze.
02Ex 38:3 Then he made all the altar utensils of bronze - the ash buckets, shovels, basins, meat forks, and firepans.
02Ex 38:4 Next he made a bronze grating and installed it halfway down the side of the altar, under the ledge.
02Ex 38:5 He cast four rings and attached them to the corners of the bronze grating to hold the carrying poles.
02Ex 38:6 He made the poles from acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze.
02Ex 38:7 He inserted the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar. The altar was hollow and was made from planks.
02Ex 38:8 Bezalel made the bronze washbasin and its bronze stand from bronze mirrors donated by the women who served at the entrance of the Tabernacle��. / ��Hebrew Tent of Meeting; also in 38.30
02Ex 38:9 Then Bezalel made the courtyard, which was enclosed with curtains made of finely woven linen. On the south side the curtains were 150 feet long��. / ��Hebrew 100 cubits [46 meters]; also in 38.11
02Ex 38:10 They were held up by twenty posts set securely in twenty bronze bases. He hung the curtains with silver hooks and rings.
02Ex 38:11 He made a similar set of curtains for the north side - 150 feet of curtains held up by twenty posts set securely in bronze bases. He hung the curtains with silver hooks and rings.
02Ex 38:12 The curtains on the west end of the courtyard were 75 feet long��, hung with silver hooks and rings and supported by ten posts set into ten bases. / ��Hebrew 50 cubits [23 meters]; also in 38.13

It was 30 feet long, and its height was 7 1/2 feet��, just like the curtains of the courtyard walls. / ��Hebrew 20 cubits [9.2 meters] long and 5 cubits [2.3 meters] high
02Ex 38:19 It was supported by four posts, each set securely in its own bronze base. The tops of the posts were overlaid with silver, and the hooks and rings were also made of silver.
02Ex 38:20 All the tent pegs used in the Tabernacle and courtyard were made of bronze.
02Ex 38:21 This is an inventory of the materials used in building the Tabernacle of the Covenant��. The Levites compiled the figures, as Moses directed, and Ithamar son of Aaron the priest served as recorder. / ��Hebrew the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle of the Testimony
02Ex 38:22 Bezalel son of Uri, grandson of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 38:23 He was assisted by Oholiab son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, a craftsman expert at engraving, designing, and embroidering with blue, purple, and scarlet thread on fine linen cloth.
02Ex 38:24 The people brought special offerings of gold totaling 2,193 pounds��, as measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel. This gold was used throughout the Tabernacle. / ��Hebrew 29 talents and 730 shekels [994 kilograms]. Each shekel weighed about 0.4 ounces
02Ex 38:25 The whole community of Israel gave 7,545 pounds�� of silver, as measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel. / ��Hebrew 100 talents and 1,775 shekels [3,420 kilograms]
02Ex 38:26 This silver came from the tax collected from each man registered in the census. (The tax is one beka, which is half a shekel��, based on the sanctuary shekel.) The tax was collected from 603,550 men who had reached their twentieth birthday. / ��Or 0.2 ounces, or 6 grams
02Ex 38:27 The hundred bases for the frames of the sanctuary walls and for the posts supporting the inner curtain required 7,500 pounds of silver, about 75 pounds for each base��. / ��Hebrew 100 talents [3,400 kilograms] of silver, 1 talent [34 kilograms] for each base
02Ex 38:28 The remaining 45 pounds�� of silver was used to make the hooks and rings and to overlay the tops of the posts. / ��Hebrew 1,775 shekels [20.2 kilograms]
02Ex 38:29 The people also brought as special offerings 5,310 pounds�� of bronze, / ��Hebrew 70 talents and 2,400 shekels [2,407 kilograms]
02Ex 38:30 which was used for casting the bases for the posts at the entrance to the Tabernacle, and for the bronze altar with its bronze grating and all the altar utensils.
02Ex 38:31 Bronze was also used to make the bases for the posts that supported the curtains around the courtyard, the bases for the curtain at the entrance of the courtyard, and all the tent pegs for the Tabernacle and the courtyard.
02Ex 39:1 The craftsmen made beautiful sacred garments of blue, purple, and scarlet cloth - clothing for Aaron to wear while ministering in the Holy Place, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:2 Bezalel�� made the ephod of finely woven linen and embroidered it with gold and with blue, purple, and scarlet thread. / ��Hebrew He; also in 39.8, 22
02Ex 39:3 He made gold thread by hammering out thin sheets of gold and cutting it into fine strands. With great skill and care, he worked it into the fine linen with the blue, purple, and scarlet thread.
02Ex 39:4 The ephod consisted of two pieces, front and back, joined at the shoulders with two shoulder-pieces.
02Ex 39:5 The decorative sash was made of the same materials�� finely woven linen embroidered with gold and with blue, purple, and scarlet thread, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:6 They mounted the two onyx stones in settings of gold filigree. The stones were engraved with the names of the tribes of Israel, just as a seal is engraved.
02Ex 39:7 He fastened these stones on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod as a reminder that the priest represents the people of Israel. All this was done just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:8 Bezalel made the chestpiece with great skill and care. He made it to match the ephod, using finely woven linen embroidered with gold and with blue, purple, and scarlet thread.
02Ex 39:9 He made the chestpiece of a single piece of cloth folded to form a pouch nine inches�� square. / ��Hebrew 1 span [23 centimeters]
02Ex 39:10 They mounted four rows of gemstones�� on it. The first row contained a red carnelian, a pale-green peridot, and an emerald. / ��The identification of some of these gemstones is uncertain
02Ex 39:11 The second row contained a turquoise, a blue lapis lazuli, and a white moonstone.
02Ex 39:12 The third row contained an orange jacinth, an agate, and a purple amethyst.
02Ex 39:13 The fourth row contained a blue-green beryl, an onyx, and a green jasper. All these stones were set in gold filigree.
02Ex 39:14 Each stone represented one of the twelve sons of Israel, and the name of that tribe was engraved on it like a seal.
02Ex 39:15 To attach the chestpiece to the ephod, they made braided cords of pure gold thread.
02Ex 39:16 They also made two settings of gold filigree and two gold rings and attached them to the top corners of the chestpiece.
02Ex 39:17 They tied the two gold cords to the rings on the chestpiece.
02Ex 39:18 They tied the other ends of the cords to the gold settings on the shoulder-pieces of the ephod.
02Ex 39:19 Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the inside edges of the chestpiece next to the ephod.
02Ex 39:20 Then they made two more gold rings and attached them to the front of the ephod, below the shoulder-pieces, just above the knot where the decorative sash was fastened to the ephod.
02Ex 39:21 They attached the bottom rings of the chestpiece to the rings on the ephod with blue cords. In this way, the chestpiece was held securely to the ephod above the decorative sash. All this was done just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:22 Bezalel made the robe that is worn with the ephod from a single piece of blue woven cloth,
02Ex 39:23 with an opening for Aaron's head in the middle of it. The opening was reinforced with a woven collar�� so it would not tear. / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
02Ex 39:24 They made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet yarn, and attached them to the hem of the robe.
02Ex 39:25 They also made bells of pure gold and placed them between the pomegranates along the hem of the robe,
02Ex 39:26 with bells and pomegranates alternating all around the hem. This robe was to be worn whenever the priest ministered before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:27 They made tunics for Aaron and his sons from fine linen cloth.
02Ex 39:28 The turban and the special head coverings were made of fine linen, and the undergarments were also made of finely woven linen.
02Ex 39:29 The sashes were made of finely woven linen and embroidered with blue, purple, and scarlet thread, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:30 Finally, they made the sacred medallion - the badge of holiness - of pure gold. They engraved it like a seal with these words�� HOLY TO THE LORD.
02Ex 39:31 They attached the medallion with a blue cord to Aaron's turban, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 39:32 And so at last the Tabernacle�� was finished. The Israelites had done everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses. / ��Hebrew the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting; also in 39.40
02Ex 39:33 And they brought the entire Tabernacle to Moses�� the sacred tent with all its furnishings, clasps, frames, crossbars, posts, and bases;
02Ex 39:34 the tent coverings of tanned ram skins and fine goatskin leather; the inner curtain to shield the Ark;
02Ex 39:35 the Ark of the Covenant�� and its carrying poles; the Ark's cover - the place of atonement; / ��Or Ark of the Testimony
02Ex 39:36 the table and all its utensils; the Bread of the Presence;
02Ex 39:37 the pure gold lampstand with its symmetrical lamp cups, all its accessories, and the olive oil for lighting;
02Ex 39:38 the gold altar; the anointing oil and fragrant incense; the curtain for the entrance of the sacred tent;
02Ex 39:39 the bronze altar; the bronze grating and its carrying poles and utensils; the washbasin with its stand; 
02Ex 39:40 the curtains for the walls of the courtyard; the posts and their bases; the curtain for the entrance to the courtyard; the ropes and tent pegs; all the furnishings to be used in worship at the Tabernacle;
02Ex 39:41 the beautifully stitched garments for the priests to wear while ministering in the Holy Place - the sacred garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments for his sons to wear as they minister as priests.
02Ex 39:42 So the people of Israel followed all of the LORD's instructions to Moses.
02Ex 39:43 Then Moses inspected all their work. When he found it had been done just as the LORD had commanded him, he blessed them.
02Ex 40:1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
02Ex 40:2 "Set up the Tabernacle�� on the first day of the new year��. / ��Hebrew the Tabernacle, the Tent of Meeting; also in 40.6, 29 ��Hebrew the first day of the first month. This day of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in March or April
02Ex 40:3 Place the Ark of the Covenant�� inside, and install the inner curtain to enclose the Ark within the Most Holy Place. / ��Or Ark of the Testimony; also in 40.5, 21
02Ex 40:4 Then bring in the table, and arrange the utensils on it. And bring in the lampstand, and set up the lamps.
02Ex 40:5 "Place the gold incense altar in front of the Ark of the Covenant. Then hang the curtain at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
02Ex 40:6 Place the altar of burnt offering in front of the Tabernacle entrance.
02Ex 40:7 Set the washbasin between the Tabernacle�� and the altar, and fill it with water. / ��Hebrew Tent of Meeting; also in 40.12, 22, 24, 26, 30, 32, 34, 35
02Ex 40:8 Then set up the courtyard around the outside of the tent, and hang the curtain for the courtyard entrance.
02Ex 40:9 "Take the anointing oil and anoint the Tabernacle and all its furnishings to consecrate them and make them holy.
02Ex 40:10 Anoint the altar of burnt offering and its utensils to consecrate them. Then the altar will become absolutely holy.
02Ex 40:11 Next anoint the washbasin and its stand to consecrate them.
02Ex 40:12 "Present Aaron and his sons at the entrance of the Tabernacle, and wash them with water.
02Ex 40:13 Dress Aaron with the sacred garments and anoint him, consecrating him to serve me as a priest.
02Ex 40:14 Then present his sons and dress them in their tunics.
02Ex 40:15 Anoint them as you did their father, so they may also serve me as priests. With their anointing, Aaron's descendants are set apart for the priesthood forever, from generation to generation."
02Ex 40:16 Moses proceeded to do everything just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:17 So the Tabernacle was set up on the first day of the first month of the second year.
02Ex 40:18 Moses erected the Tabernacle by setting down its bases, inserting the frames, attaching the crossbars, and setting up the posts.
02Ex 40:19 Then he spread the coverings over the Tabernacle framework and put on the protective layers, just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:20 He took the stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant and placed them�� inside the Ark. Then he attached the carrying poles to the Ark, and he set the Ark's cover - the place of atonement - on top of it. / ��Hebrew He placed the Testimony; see note on 25.16
02Ex 40:21 Then he brought the Ark of the Covenant into the Tabernacle and hung the inner curtain to shield it from view, just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:22 Next Moses placed the table in the Tabernacle, along the north side of the Holy Place, just outside the inner curtain.
02Ex 40:23 And he arranged the Bread of the Presence on the table before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:24 He set the lampstand in the Tabernacle across from the table on the south side of the Holy Place.
02Ex 40:25 Then he lit the lamps in the LORD's presence, just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:26 He also placed the gold incense altar in the Tabernacle, in the Holy Place in front of the inner curtain.
02Ex 40:27 On it he burned the fragrant incense, just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:28 He hung the curtain at the entrance of the Tabernacle,
02Ex 40:29 and he placed the altar of burnt offering near the Tabernacle entrance. On it he offered a burnt offering and a grain offering, just as the LORD had commanded him.
02Ex 40:30 Next Moses placed the washbasin between the Tabernacle and the altar. He filled it with water so the priests could wash themselves.
02Ex 40:31 Moses and Aaron and Aaron's sons used water from it to wash their hands and feet.
02Ex 40:32 Whenever they approached the altar and entered the Tabernacle, they washed themselves, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
02Ex 40:33 Then he hung the curtains forming the courtyard around the Tabernacle and the altar. And he set up the curtain at the entrance of the courtyard. So at last Moses finished the work.
02Ex 40:34 Then the cloud covered the Tabernacle, and the glory of the LORD filled the Tabernacle.
02Ex 40:35 Moses could no longer enter the Tabernacle because the cloud had settled down over it, and the glory of the LORD filled the Tabernacle.
02Ex 40:36 Now whenever the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle, the people of Israel would set out on their journey, following it.
02Ex 40:37 But if the cloud did not rise, they remained where they were until it lifted.
02Ex 40:38 The cloud of the LORD hovered over the Tabernacle during the day, and at night fire glowed inside the cloud so the whole family of Israel could see it. This continued throughout all their journeys.

03Lv 8:32 Any meat or bread that is left over must then be burned up.
03Lv 8:33 You must not leave the Tabernacle entrance for seven days, for that is when the ordination ceremony will be completed.
03Lv 8:34 Everything we have done today was commanded by the LORD in order to purify you, making you right with him��. / ��Or to make atonement for you
03Lv 8:35 Now stay at the entrance of the Tabernacle day and night for seven days, and do everything the LORD requires. If you fail to do this, you will die, for this is what the LORD has commanded."
03Lv 8:36 So Aaron and his sons did everything the LORD had commanded through Moses.
03Lv 9:1 After the ordination ceremony, on the eighth day, Moses called together Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel.
03Lv 9:2 He said to Aaron, "Take a young bull for a sin offering and a ram for a burnt offering, both without defects, and present them to the LORD.
03Lv 9:3 Then tell the Israelites, 'Take a male goat for a sin offering, and take a calf and a lamb, both a year old and without defects, for a burnt offering.
03Lv 9:4 Also take a bull�� and a ram for a peace offering and flour moistened with olive oil for a grain offering. Present all these offerings to the LORD because the LORD will appear to you today.'" / ��Or cow; also in 9.18, 19
03Lv 9:5 So the people presented all these things at the entrance of the Tabernacle��, just as Moses had commanded. Then the whole community came forward and stood before the LORD. / ��Hebrew Tent of Meeting; also in 9.23
03Lv 9:6 And Moses said, "This is what the LORD has commanded you to do so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you."
03Lv 9:7 Then Moses said to Aaron, "Come to the altar and sacrifice your sin offering and your burnt offering to purify yourself and the people. Then present the offerings of the people to purify them, making them right with the LORD��, just as he has commanded." / ��Or to make atonement for them
03Lv 9:8 So Aaron went to the altar and slaughtered the calf as a sin offering for himself.
03Lv 9:9 His sons brought him the blood, and he dipped his finger in it and put it on the horns of the altar. He poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar.
03Lv 9:10 Then he burned on the altar the fat, the kidneys, and the long lobe of the liver from the sin offering, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 9:11 The meat and the hide, however, he burned outside the camp.
03Lv 9:12 Next Aaron slaughtered the animal for the burnt offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it against all sides of the altar.
03Lv 9:13 Then they handed him each piece of the burnt offering, including the head, and he burned them on the altar.
03Lv 9:14 Then he washed the internal organs and the legs and burned them on the altar along with the rest of the burnt offering.
03Lv 9:15 Next Aaron presented the offerings of the people. He slaughtered the people's goat and presented it as an offering for their sin, just as he had first done with the offering for his own sin.
03Lv 9:16 Then he presented the burnt offering and sacrificed it in the prescribed way.
03Lv 9:17 He also presented the grain offering, burning a handful of the flour mixture on the altar, in addition to the regular burnt offering for the morning.
03Lv 9:18 Then Aaron slaughtered the bull and the ram for the people's peace offering. His sons brought him the blood, and he splattered it against all sides of the altar.
03Lv 9:19 Then he took the fat of the bull and the ram - the fat of the broad tail and from around the internal organs - along with the kidneys and the long lobes of the livers.
03Lv 9:20 He placed these fat portions on top of the breasts of these animals and burned them on the altar.
03Lv 9:21 Aaron then lifted up the breasts and right thighs as a special offering to the LORD, just as Moses had commanded.
03Lv 9:22 After that, Aaron raised his hands toward the people and blessed them. Then, after presenting the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offering, he stepped down from the altar.
03Lv 9:23 Then Moses and Aaron went into the Tabernacle, and when they came back out, they blessed the people again, and the glory of the LORD appeared to the whole community.
03Lv 9:24 Fire blazed forth from the LORD's presence and consumed the burnt offering and the fat on the altar. When the people saw this, they shouted with joy and fell face down on the ground.
03Lv 10:1 Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu put coals of fire in their incense burners and sprinkled incense over them. In this way, they disobeyed the LORD by burning before him the wrong kind of fire, different than he had commanded.
03Lv 10:2 So fire blazed forth from the LORD's presence and burned them up, and they died there before the LORD.
03Lv 10:3 Then Moses said to Aaron, "This is what the LORD meant when he said, 'I will display my holiness through those who come near me. I will display my glory before all the people.'"
03Lv 10:4 Then Moses called for Mishael and Elzaphan, Aaron's cousins, the sons of Aaron's uncle Uzziel. He said to them, "Come forward and carry away the bodies of your relatives from in front of the sanctuary to a place outside the camp."
03Lv 10:5 So they came forward and picked them up by their garments and carried them out of the camp, just as Moses had commanded.
03Lv 10:6 Then Moses said to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar, "Do not show grief by leaving your hair uncombed�� or by tearing your clothes. If you do, you will die, and the LORD's anger will strike the whole community of Israel. However, the rest of the Israelites, your relatives, may mourn because of the LORD's fiery destruction of Nadab and Abihu. / ��Or by uncovering your heads
03Lv 10:7 But you must not leave the entrance of the Tabernacle�� or you will die, for you have been anointed with the LORD's anointing oil." So they did as Moses commanded.
03Lv 10:8 Then the LORD said to Aaron, / ��Hebrew Tent of Meeting; also in 10.9
03Lv 10:9 "You and your descendants must never drink wine or any other alcoholic drink before going into the Tabernacle. If you do, you will die. This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed from generation to generation.
03Lv 10:10 You must distinguish between what is sacred and what is common, between what is ceremonially unclean and what is clean.
03Lv 10:11 And you must teach the Israelites all the decrees that the LORD has given them through Moses."
03Lv 10:12 Then Moses said to Aaron and his remaining sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, "Take what is left of the grain offering after a portion has been presented as a special gift to the LORD, and eat it beside the altar. Make sure it contains no yeast, for it is most holy.
03Lv 10:13 You must eat it in a sacred place, for it has been given to you and your descendants as your portion of the special gifts presented to the LORD. These are the commands I have been given.
03Lv 10:14 But the breast and thigh that were lifted up as a special offering may be eaten in any place that is ceremonially clean. These parts have been given to you and your descendants as your portion of the peace offerings presented by the people of Israel.
03Lv 10:15 You must lift up the thigh and breast as a special offering to the LORD, along with the fat of the special gifts. These parts will belong to you and your descendants as your permanent right, just as the LORD has commanded."
03Lv 10:16 Moses then asked them what had happened to the goat of the sin offering. When he discovered it had been burned up, he became very angry with Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron's remaining sons.
03Lv 10:17 "Why didn't you eat the sin offering in the sacred area?" he demanded. "It is a holy offering! The LORD has given it to you to remove the guilt of the community and to purify the people, making them right with the LORD��. / ��Or to make atonement for the people before the LORD
03Lv 10:18 Since the animal's blood was not brought into the Holy Place, you should have eaten the meat in the sacred area as I ordered you."
03Lv 10:19 Then Aaron answered Moses, "Today my sons presented both their sin offering and their burnt offering to the LORD. And yet this tragedy has happened to me. If I had eaten the people's sin offering on such a tragic day as this, would the LORD have been pleased?"
03Lv 10:20 And when Moses heard this, he was satisfied.
03Lv 11:1 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
03Lv 11:2 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. "Of all the land animals, these are the ones you may use for food.
03Lv 11:3 You may eat any animal that has completely split hooves and chews the cud.
03Lv 11:4 You may not, however, eat the following animals�� that have split hooves or that chew the cud, but not both. The camel chews the cud but does not have split hooves, so it is ceremonially unclean for you. / ��The identification of some of the animals, birds, and insects in this chapter is uncertain
03Lv 11:5 The hyrax�� chews the cud but does not have split hooves, so it is unclean. / ��Or coney, or rock badger
03Lv 11:6 The hare chews the cud but does not have split hooves, so it is unclean.
03Lv 11:7 The pig has evenly split hooves but does not chew the cud, so it is unclean.
03Lv 11:8 You may not eat the meat of these animals or even touch their carcasses. They are ceremonially unclean for you.
03Lv 11:9 "Of all the marine animals, these are ones you may use for food. You may eat anything from the water if it has both fins and scales, whether taken from salt water or from streams.
03Lv 11:10 But you must never eat animals from the sea or from rivers that do not have both fins and scales. They are detestable to you. This applies both to little creatures that live in shallow water and to all creatures that live in deep water.
03Lv 11:11 They will always be detestable to you. You must never eat their meat or even touch their dead bodies.
03Lv 11:12 Any marine animal that does not have both fins and scales is detestable to you.

03Lv 11:22 The insects you are permitted to eat include all kinds of locusts, bald locusts, crickets, and grasshoppers.
03Lv 11:23 All other winged insects that walk along the ground are detestable to you.
03Lv 11:24 "The following creatures will make you ceremonially unclean. If any of you touch their carcasses, you will be defiled until evening.
03Lv 11:25 If you pick up their carcasses, you must wash your clothes, and you will remain defiled until evening.

03Lv 11:32 If such an animal dies and falls on something, that object will be unclean. This is true whether the object is made of wood, cloth, leather, or burlap. Whatever its use, you must dip it in water, and it will remain defiled until evening. After that, it will be ceremonially clean and may be used again.

03Lv 11:47 By these instructions you will know what is unclean and clean, and which animals may be eaten and which may not be eaten."
03Lv 12:1 The LORD said to Moses, "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.
03Lv 12:2 If a woman becomes pregnant and gives birth to a son, she will be ceremonially unclean for seven days, just as she is unclean during her menstrual period.
03Lv 12:3 On the eighth day the boy's foreskin must be circumcised.

She must bring her offerings to the priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle��. / ��Hebrew Tent of Meeting

03Lv 13:1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
03Lv 13:2 "If anyone has a swelling or a rash or discolored skin that might develop into a serious skin disease��, that person must be brought to Aaron the priest or to one of his sons��. / ��Traditionally rendered leprosy. The Hebrew word used throughout this passage is used to describe various skin diseases ��Or one of his descendants
03Lv 13:3 The priest will examine the affected area of the skin. If the hair in the affected area has turned white and the problem appears to be more than skin-deep, it is a serious skin disease, and the priest who examines it must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean.
03Lv 13:4 "But if the affected area of the skin is only a white discoloration and does not appear to be more than skin-deep, and if the hair on the spot has not turned white, the priest will quarantine the person for seven days.
03Lv 13:5 On the seventh day the priest will make another examination. If he finds the affected area has not changed and the problem has not spread on the skin, the priest will quarantine the person for seven more days.
03Lv 13:6 On the seventh day the priest will make another examination. If he finds the affected area has faded and has not spread, the priest will pronounce the person ceremonially clean. It was only a rash. The person's clothing must be washed, and the person will be ceremonially clean.
03Lv 13:7 But if the rash continues to spread after the person has been examined by the priest and has been pronounced clean, the infected person must return to be examined again.
03Lv 13:8 If the priest finds that the rash has spread, he must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean, for it is indeed a skin disease.
03Lv 13:9 "Anyone who develops a serious skin disease must go to the priest for an examination.
03Lv 13:10 If the priest finds a white swelling on the skin, and some hair on the spot has turned white, and there is an open sore in the affected area,
03Lv 13:11 it is a chronic skin disease, and the priest must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean. In such cases the person need not be quarantined, for it is obvious that the skin is defiled by the disease.
03Lv 13:12 "Now suppose the disease has spread all over the person's skin, covering the body from head to foot.
03Lv 13:13 When the priest examines the infected person and finds that the disease covers the entire body, he will pronounce the person ceremonially clean. Since the skin has turned completely white, the person is clean.
03Lv 13:14 But if any open sores appear, the infected person will be pronounced ceremonially unclean.
03Lv 13:15 The priest must make this pronouncement as soon as he sees an open sore, since open sores indicate the presence of a skin disease.
03Lv 13:16 However, if the open sores heal and turn white like the rest of the skin, the person must return to the priest
03Lv 13:17 for another examination. If the affected areas have indeed turned white, the priest will then pronounce the person ceremonially clean by declaring, 'You are clean!'
03Lv 13:18 "If anyone has a boil on the skin that has started to heal,
03Lv 13:19 but a white swelling or a reddish white spot develops in its place, that person must go to the priest to be examined.
03Lv 13:20 If the priest examines it and finds it to be more than skin-deep, and if the hair in the affected area has turned white, the priest must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean. The boil has become a serious skin disease.
03Lv 13:21 But if the priest finds no white hair on the affected area and the problem appears to be no more than skin-deep and has faded, the priest must quarantine the person for seven days.
03Lv 13:22 If during that time the affected area spreads on the skin, the priest must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean, because it is a serious disease.
03Lv 13:23 But if the area grows no larger and does not spread, it is merely the scar from the boil, and the priest will pronounce the person ceremonially clean.
03Lv 13:24 "If anyone has suffered a burn on the skin and the burned area changes color, becoming either reddish white or shiny white,
03Lv 13:25 the priest must examine it. If he finds that the hair in the affected area has turned white and the problem appears to be more than skin-deep, a skin disease has broken out in the burn. The priest must then pronounce the person ceremonially unclean, for it is clearly a serious skin disease.
03Lv 13:26 But if the priest finds no white hair on the affected area and the problem appears to be no more than skin-deep and has faded, the priest must quarantine the infected person for seven days.
03Lv 13:27 On the seventh day the priest must examine the person again. If the affected area has spread on the skin, the priest must pronounce that person ceremonially unclean, for it is clearly a serious skin disease.
03Lv 13:28 But if the affected area has not changed or spread on the skin and has faded, it is simply a swelling from the burn. The priest will then pronounce the person ceremonially clean, for it is only the scar from the burn.
03Lv 13:29 "If anyone, either a man or woman, has a sore on the head or chin,
03Lv 13:30 the priest must examine it. If he finds it is more than skin-deep and has fine yellow hair on it, the priest must pronounce the person ceremonially unclean. It is a scabby sore of the head or chin.
03Lv 13:31 If the priest examines the scabby sore and finds that it is only skin-deep but there is no black hair on it, he must quarantine the person for seven days.
03Lv 13:32 On the seventh day the priest must examine the sore again. If he finds that the scabby sore has not spread, and there is no yellow hair on it, and it appears to be only skin-deep,
03Lv 13:33 the person must shave off all hair except the hair on the affected area. Then the priest must quarantine the person for another seven days.
03Lv 13:34 On the seventh day he will examine the sore again. If it has not spread and appears to be no more than skin-deep, the priest will pronounce the person ceremonially clean. The person's clothing must be washed, and the person will be ceremonially clean.
03Lv 13:35 But if the scabby sore begins to spread after the person is pronounced clean,
03Lv 13:36 the priest must do another examination. If he finds that the sore has spread, the priest does not need to look for yellow hair. The infected person is ceremonially unclean.
03Lv 13:37 But if the color of the scabby sore does not change and black hair has grown on it, it has healed. The priest will then pronounce the person ceremonially clean.
03Lv 13:38 "If anyone, either a man or woman, has shiny white patches on the skin,
03Lv 13:39 the priest must examine the affected area. If he finds that the shiny patches are only pale white, this is a harmless skin rash, and the person is ceremonially clean.
03Lv 13:40 "If a man loses his hair and his head becomes bald, he is still ceremonially clean.
03Lv 13:41 And if he loses hair on his forehead, he simply has a bald forehead; he is still clean.
03Lv 13:42 However, if a reddish white sore appears on the bald area at the top or back of his head, this is a skin disease.
03Lv 13:43 The priest must examine him, and if he finds swelling around the reddish white sore anywhere on the man's head and it looks like a skin disease,
03Lv 13:44 the man is indeed infected with a skin disease and is unclean. The priest must pronounce him ceremonially unclean because of the sore on his head.
03Lv 13:45 "Those who suffer from a serious skin disease must tear their clothing and leave their hair uncombed��. They must cover their mouth and call out, 'Unclean! Unclean!' / ��Or and uncover their heads
03Lv 13:46 As long as the serious disease lasts, they will be ceremonially unclean. They must live in isolation in their place outside the camp.
03Lv 13:47 "Now suppose mildew�� contaminates some woolen or linen clothing, / ��Traditionally rendered leprosy. The Hebrew term used throughout this passage is the same term used for the various skin diseases described in 13.1-46

03Lv 13:50 After examining the affected spot, the priest will put the article in quarantine for seven days.
03Lv 13:51 On the seventh day the priest must inspect it again. If the contaminated area has spread, the clothing or fabric or leather is clearly contaminated by a serious mildew and is ceremonially unclean.
03Lv 13:52 The priest must burn the item - the clothing, the woolen or linen fabric, or piece of leather - for it has been contaminated by a serious mildew. It must be completely destroyed by fire.
03Lv 13:53 "But if the priest examines it and finds that the contaminated area has not spread in the clothing, the fabric, or the leather,
03Lv 13:54 the priest will order the object to be washed and then quarantined for seven more days.
03Lv 13:55 Then the priest must examine the object again. If he finds that the contaminated area has not changed color after being washed, even if it did not spread, the object is defiled. It must be completely burned up, whether the contaminated spot�� is on the inside or outside. / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
03Lv 13:56 But if the priest examines it and finds that the contaminated area has faded after being washed, he must cut the spot from the clothing, the fabric, or the leather.
03Lv 13:57 If the spot later reappears on the clothing, the fabric, or the leather article, the mildew is clearly spreading, and the contaminated object must be burned up.
03Lv 13:58 But if the spot disappears from the clothing, the fabric, or the leather article after it has been washed, it must be washed again; then it will be ceremonially clean.
03Lv 13:59 "These are the instructions for dealing with mildew that contaminates woolen or linen clothing or fabric or anything made of leather. This is how the priest will determine whether these items are ceremonially clean or unclean."
03Lv 14:1 And the LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 14:2 "The following instructions are for those seeking ceremonial purification from a skin disease��. Those who have been healed must be brought to the priest, / ��Traditionally rendered leprosy; see note on 13.2a
03Lv 14:3 who will examine them at a place outside the camp. If the priest finds that someone has been healed of a serious skin disease,

03Lv 14:7 The priest will then sprinkle the blood of the dead bird seven times on the person being purified of the skin disease. When the priest has purified the person, he will release the live bird in the open field to fly away.
03Lv 14:8 "The persons being purified must then wash their clothes, shave off all their hair, and bathe themselves in water. Then they will be ceremonially clean and may return to the camp. However, they must remain outside their tents for seven days.
03Lv 14:9 On the seventh day they must again shave all the hair from their heads, including the hair of the beard and eyebrows. They must also wash their clothes and bathe themselves in water. Then they will be ceremonially clean.

03Lv 21:4 But a priest must not defile himself and make himself unclean for someone who is related to him only by marriage.
03Lv 21:5 "The priests must not shave their heads or trim their beards or cut their bodies.
03Lv 21:6 They must be set apart as holy to their God and must never bring shame on the name of God. They must be holy, for they are the ones who present the special gifts to the LORD, gifts of food for their God.
03Lv 21:7 "Priests may not marry a woman defiled by prostitution, and they may not marry a woman who is divorced from her husband, for the priests are set apart as holy to their God.
03Lv 21:8 You must treat them as holy because they offer up food to your God. You must consider them holy because I, the LORD, am holy, and I make you holy.
03Lv 21:9 "If a priest's daughter defiles herself by becoming a prostitute, she also defiles her father's holiness, and she must be burned to death.
03Lv 21:10 "The high priest has the highest rank of all the priests. The anointing oil has been poured on his head, and he has been ordained to wear the priestly garments. He must never leave his hair uncombed�� or tear his clothing. / ��Or never uncover his head

03Lv 21:12 He must not defile the sanctuary of his God by leaving it to attend to a dead person, for he has been made holy by the anointing oil of his God. I am the LORD.
03Lv 21:13 "The high priest may marry only a virgin.

03Lv 21:15 so that he will not dishonor his descendants among his clan, for I am the LORD who makes him holy."
03Lv 21:16 Then the LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 21:17 "Give the following instructions to Aaron�� In all future generations, none of your descendants who has any defect will qualify to offer food to his God.
03Lv 21:18 No one who has a defect qualifies, whether he is blind, lame, disfigured, deformed,
03Lv 21:19 or has a broken foot or arm,
03Lv 21:20 or is hunchbacked or dwarfed, or has a defective eye, or skin sores or scabs, or damaged testicles.
03Lv 21:21 No descendant of Aaron who has a defect may approach the altar to present special gifts to the LORD. Since he has a defect, he may not approach the altar to offer food to his God.
03Lv 21:22 However, he may eat from the food offered to God, including the holy offerings and the most holy offerings.
03Lv 21:23 Yet because of his physical defect, he may not enter the room behind the inner curtain or approach the altar, for this would defile my holy places. I am the LORD who makes them holy."
03Lv 21:24 So Moses gave these instructions to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites.
03Lv 22:1 The LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 22:2 "Tell Aaron and his sons to be very careful with the sacred gifts that the Israelites set apart for me, so they do not bring shame on my holy name. I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:3 Give them the following instructions. "In all future generations, if any of your descendants is ceremonially unclean when he approaches the sacred offerings that the people of Israel consecrate to the LORD, he must be cut off from my presence. I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:4 "If any of Aaron's descendants has a skin disease�� or any kind of discharge that makes him ceremonially unclean, he may not eat from the sacred offerings until he has been pronounced clean. He also becomes unclean by touching a corpse, or by having an emission of semen, / ��Traditionally rendered leprosy; see note on 13.2a

03Lv 22:6 The man who is defiled in any of these ways will remain unclean until evening. He may not eat from the sacred offerings until he has bathed himself in water.
03Lv 22:7 When the sun goes down, he will be ceremonially clean again and may eat from the sacred offerings, for this is his food.
03Lv 22:8 He may not eat an animal that has died a natural death or has been torn apart by wild animals, for this would defile him. I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:9 "The priests must follow my instructions carefully. Otherwise they will be punished for their sin and will die for violating my instructions. I am the LORD who makes them holy.
03Lv 22:10 "No one outside a priest's family may eat the sacred offerings. Even guests and hired workers in a priest's home are not allowed to eat them.
03Lv 22:11 However, if the priest buys a slave for himself, the slave may eat from the sacred offerings. And if his slaves have children, they also may share his food.
03Lv 22:12 If a priest's daughter marries someone outside the priestly family, she may no longer eat the sacred offerings.
03Lv 22:13 But if she becomes a widow or is divorced and has no children to support her, and she returns to live in her father's home as in her youth, she may eat her father's food again. Otherwise, no one outside a priest's family may eat the sacred offerings.
03Lv 22:14 "Any such person who eats the sacred offerings without realizing it must pay the priest for the amount eaten, plus an additional 20 percent.
03Lv 22:15 The priests must not let the Israelites defile the sacred offerings brought to the LORD
03Lv 22:16 by allowing unauthorized people to eat them. This would bring guilt upon them and require them to pay compensation. I am the LORD who makes them holy."
03Lv 22:17 And the LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 22:18 "Give Aaron and his sons and all the Israelites these instructions, which apply both to native Israelites and to the foreigners living among you. "If you present a gift as a burnt offering to the LORD, whether it is to fulfill a vow or is a voluntary offering,

03Lv 22:22 You must not offer an animal that is blind, crippled, or injured, or that has a wart, a skin sore, or scabs. Such animals must never be offered on the altar as special gifts to the LORD.

03Lv 22:25 and you must not accept such an animal from foreigners and then offer it as a sacrifice to your God. Such animals will not be accepted on your behalf, for they are mutilated or defective."
03Lv 22:26 And the LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 22:27 "When a calf or lamb or goat is born, it must be left with its mother for seven days. From the eighth day on, it will be acceptable as a special gift to the LORD.
03Lv 22:28 But you must not slaughter a mother animal and her offspring on the same day, whether from the herd or the flock.
03Lv 22:29 When you bring a thanksgiving offering to the LORD, sacrifice it properly so you will be accepted.
03Lv 22:30 Eat the entire sacrificial animal on the day it is presented. Do not leave any of it until the next morning. I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:31 "You must faithfully keep all my commands by putting them into practice, for I am the LORD.
03Lv 22:32 Do not bring shame on my holy name, for I will display my holiness among the people of Israel. I am the LORD who makes you holy.
03Lv 22:33 It was I who rescued you from the land of Egypt, that I might be your God. I am the LORD."
03Lv 23:1 The LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 23:2 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. These are the LORD's appointed festivals, which you are to proclaim as official days for holy assembly.
03Lv 23:3 "You have six days each week for your ordinary work, but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of complete rest, an official day for holy assembly. It is the LORD's Sabbath day, and it must be observed wherever you live.
03Lv 23:4 "In addition to the Sabbath, these are the LORD's appointed festivals, the official days for holy assembly that are to be celebrated at their proper times each year.

03Lv 23:7 On the first day of the festival, all the people must stop their ordinary work and observe an official day for holy assembly.
03Lv 23:8 For seven days you must present special gifts to the LORD. On the seventh day the people must again stop all their ordinary work to observe an official day for holy assembly."
03Lv 23:9 Then the LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 23:10 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. When you enter the land I am giving you and you harvest its first crops, bring the priest a bundle of grain from the first cutting of your grain harvest.
03Lv 23:11 On the day after the Sabbath, the priest will lift it up before the LORD so it may be accepted on your behalf.
03Lv 23:12 On that same day you must sacrifice a one-year-old male lamb with no defects as a burnt offering to the LORD.

03Lv 23:15 "From the day after the Sabbath - the day you bring the bundle of grain to be lifted up as a special offering - count off seven full weeks.
03Lv 23:16 Keep counting until the day after the seventh Sabbath, fifty days later. Then present an offering of new grain to the LORD.
03Lv 23:17 From wherever you live, bring two loaves of bread to be lifted up before the LORD as a special offering. Make these loaves from four quarts of choice flour, and bake them with yeast. They will be an offering to the LORD from the first of your crops.
03Lv 23:18 Along with the bread, present seven one-year-old male lambs with no defects, one young bull, and two rams as burnt offerings to the LORD. These burnt offerings, together with the grain offerings and liquid offerings, will be a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
03Lv 23:19 Then you must offer one male goat as a sin offering and two one-year-old male lambs as a peace offering.
03Lv 23:20 "The priest will lift up the two lambs as a special offering to the LORD, together with the loaves representing the first of your crops. These offerings, which are holy to the LORD, belong to the priests.
03Lv 23:21 That same day will be proclaimed an official day for holy assembly, a day on which you do no ordinary work. This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed from generation to generation wherever you live��. / ��This celebration, called the Festival of Harvest or the Festival of Weeks, was later called the Festival of Pentecost (see Acts 2.1). It is celebrated today as Shavuat (or Shabuoth)
03Lv 23:22 "When you harvest the crops of your land, do not harvest the grain along the edges of your fields, and do not pick up what the harvesters drop. Leave it for the poor and the foreigners living among you. I am the LORD your God."
03Lv 23:23 The LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 23:24 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. On the first day of the appointed month in early autumn��, you are to observe a day of complete rest.

03Lv 23:25 You must do no ordinary work on that day. Instead, you are to present special gifts to the LORD."
03Lv 23:26 Then the LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 23:27 "Be careful to celebrate the Day of Atonement on the tenth day of that same month - nine days after the Festival of Trumpets��. You must observe it as an official day for holy assembly, a day to deny yourselves�� and present special gifts to the LORD. / ��Hebrew on the tenth day of the seventh month; see 23.24 and the note there. This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in September or October. It is celebrated today as Yom Kippur ��Or to fast; similarly in 23.29, 32

03Lv 23:32 This will be a Sabbath day of complete rest for you, and on that day you must deny yourselves. This day of rest will begin at sundown on the ninth day of the month and extend until sundown on the tenth day."
03Lv 23:33 And the LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 23:34 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. Begin celebrating the Festival of Shelters�� on the fifteenth day of the appointed month - five days after the Day of Atonement��. This festival to the LORD will last for seven days. / ��Or Festival of Booths, or Festival of Tabernacles. This was earlier called the Festival of the Final Harvest or Festival of Ingathering (see Exod 23.16b). It is celebrated today as Sukkot (or Succoth) ��Hebrew on the fifteenth day of the seventh month; see 23.27a and the note there
03Lv 23:35 On the first day of the festival you must proclaim an official day for holy assembly, when you do no ordinary work.
03Lv 23:36 For seven days you must present special gifts to the LORD. The eighth day is another holy day on which you present your special gifts to the LORD. This will be a solemn occasion, and no ordinary work may be done that day.
03Lv 23:37 ("These are the LORD's appointed festivals. Celebrate them each year as official days for holy assembly by presenting special gifts to the LORD - burnt offerings, grain offerings, sacrifices, and liquid offerings - each on its proper day.
03Lv 23:38 These festivals must be observed in addition to the LORD's regular Sabbath days, and the offerings are in addition to your personal gifts, the offerings you give to fulfill your vows, and the voluntary offerings you present to the LORD.)
03Lv 23:39 "Remember that this seven-day festival to the LORD - the Festival of Shelters - begins on the fifteenth day of the appointed month��, after you have harvested all the produce of the land. The first day and the eighth day of the festival will be days of complete rest. / ��Hebrew on the fifteenth day of the seventh month

03Lv 23:43 This will remind each new generation of Israelites that I made their ancestors live in shelters when I rescued them from the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God."
03Lv 23:44 So Moses gave the Israelites these instructions regarding the annual festivals of the LORD.
03Lv 24:1 The LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 24:2 "Command the people of Israel to bring you pure oil of pressed olives for the light, to keep the lamps burning continually.
03Lv 24:3 This is the lampstand that stands in the Tabernacle, in front of the inner curtain that shields the Ark of the Covenant��. Aaron must keep the lamps burning in the LORD's presence all night. This is a permanent law for you, and it must be observed from generation to generation. / ��Hebrew in the Tent of Meeting, outside the inner curtain of the Testimony; see note on 16.13
03Lv 24:4 Aaron and the priests must tend the lamps on the pure gold lampstand continually in the LORD's presence.
03Lv 24:5 "You must bake twelve loaves of bread from choice flour, using four quarts�� of flour for each loaf. / ��Hebrew 2/10 of an ephah [4.4 liters]
03Lv 24:6 Place the bread before the LORD on the pure gold table, and arrange the loaves in two rows, with six loaves in each row.
03Lv 24:7 Put some pure frankincense near each row to serve as a representative offering, a special gift presented to the LORD.
03Lv 24:8 Every Sabbath day this bread must be laid out before the LORD. The bread is to be received from the people of Israel as a requirement of the eternal covenant.
03Lv 24:9 The loaves of bread will belong to Aaron and his descendants, who must eat them in a sacred place, for they are most holy. It is the permanent right of the priests to claim this portion of the special gifts presented to the LORD."
03Lv 24:10 One day a man who had an Israelite mother and an Egyptian father came out of his tent and got into a fight with one of the Israelite men.
03Lv 24:11 During the fight, this son of an Israelite woman blasphemed the Name of the LORD�� with a curse. So the man was brought to Moses for judgment. His mother was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri of the tribe of Dan. / ��Hebrew the Name; also in 24.16b
03Lv 24:12 They kept the man in custody until the LORD's will in the matter should become clear to them.
03Lv 24:13 Then the LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 24:14 "Take the blasphemer outside the camp, and tell all those who heard the curse to lay their hands on his head. Then let the entire community stone him to death.
03Lv 24:15 Say to the people of Israel�� Those who curse their God will be punished for their sin.
03Lv 24:16 Anyone who blasphemes the Name of the LORD must be stoned to death by the whole community of Israel. Any native-born Israelite or foreigner among you who blasphemes the Name of the LORD must be put to death.
03Lv 24:17 "Anyone who takes another person's life must be put to death.
03Lv 24:18 "Anyone who kills another person's animal must pay for it in full - a live animal for the animal that was killed.
03Lv 24:19 "Anyone who injures another person must be dealt with according to the injury inflicted - 
03Lv 24:20 a fracture for a fracture, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. Whatever anyone does to injure another person must be paid back in kind.
03Lv 24:21 "Whoever kills an animal must pay for it in full, but whoever kills another person must be put to death.
03Lv 24:22 "This same standard applies both to native-born Israelites and to the foreigners living among you. I am the LORD your God."
03Lv 24:23 After Moses gave all these instructions to the Israelites, they took the blasphemer outside the camp and stoned him to death. The Israelites did just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
03Lv 25:1 While Moses was on Mount Sinai, the LORD said to him,
03Lv 25:2 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. When you have entered the land I am giving you, the land itself must observe a Sabbath rest before the LORD every seventh year.
03Lv 25:3 For six years you may plant your fields and prune your vineyards and harvest your crops,
03Lv 25:4 but during the seventh year the land must have a Sabbath year of complete rest. It is the LORD's Sabbath. Do not plant your fields or prune your vineyards during that year.
03Lv 25:5 And don't store away the crops that grow on their own or gather the grapes from your unpruned vines. The land must have a year of complete rest.
03Lv 25:6 But you may eat whatever the land produces on its own during its Sabbath. This applies to you, your male and female servants, your hired workers, and the temporary residents who live with you.
03Lv 25:7 Your livestock and the wild animals in your land will also be allowed to eat what the land produces.
03Lv 25:8 "In addition, you must count off seven Sabbath years, seven sets of seven years, adding up to forty-nine years in all.
03Lv 25:9 Then on the Day of Atonement in the fiftieth year��, blow the ram's horn loud and long throughout the land. / ��Hebrew on the tenth day of the seventh month, on the Day of Atonement; see 23.27a and the note there
03Lv 25:10 Set this year apart as holy, a time to proclaim freedom throughout the land for all who live there. It will be a jubilee year for you, when each of you may return to the land that belonged to your ancestors and return to your own clan.
03Lv 25:11 This fiftieth year will be a jubilee for you. During that year you must not plant your fields or store away any of the crops that grow on their own, and don't gather the grapes from your unpruned vines.
03Lv 25:12 It will be a jubilee year for you, and you must keep it holy. But you may eat whatever the land produces on its own.
03Lv 25:13 In the Year of Jubilee each of you may return to the land that belonged to your ancestors.
03Lv 25:14 "When you make an agreement with your neighbor to buy or sell property, you must not take advantage of each other.
03Lv 25:15 When you buy land from your neighbor, the price you pay must be based on the number of years since the last jubilee. The seller must set the price by taking into account the number of years remaining until the next Year of Jubilee.
03Lv 25:16 The more years until the next jubilee, the higher the price; the fewer years, the lower the price. After all, the person selling the land is actually selling you a certain number of harvests.
03Lv 25:17 Show your fear of God by not taking advantage of each other. I am the LORD your God.
03Lv 25:18 "If you want to live securely in the land, follow my decrees and obey my regulations.
03Lv 25:19 Then the land will yield large crops, and you will eat your fill and live securely in it.
03Lv 25:20 But you might ask, 'What will we eat during the seventh year, since we are not allowed to plant or harvest crops that year?'
03Lv 25:21 Be assured that I will send my blessing for you in the sixth year, so the land will produce a crop large enough for three years.
03Lv 25:22 When you plant your fields in the eighth year, you will still be eating from the large crop of the sixth year. In fact, you will still be eating from that large crop when the new crop is harvested in the ninth year.
03Lv 25:23 "The land must never be sold on a permanent basis, for the land belongs to me. You are only foreigners and tenant farmers working for me.
03Lv 25:24 "With every purchase of land you must grant the seller the right to buy it back.
03Lv 25:25 If one of your fellow Israelites falls into poverty and is forced to sell some family land, then a close relative should buy it back for him.
03Lv 25:26 If there is no close relative to buy the land, but the person who sold it gets enough money to buy it back,
03Lv 25:27 he then has the right to redeem it from the one who bought it. The price of the land will be discounted according to the number of years until the next Year of Jubilee. In this way the original owner can then return to the land.
03Lv 25:28 But if the original owner cannot afford to buy back the land, it will remain with the new owner until the next Year of Jubilee. In the jubilee year, the land must be returned to the original owners so they can return to their family land.
03Lv 25:29 "Anyone who sells a house inside a walled town has the right to buy it back for a full year after its sale. During that year, the seller retains the right to buy it back.
03Lv 25:30 But if it is not bought back within a year, the sale of the house within the walled town cannot be reversed. It will become the permanent property of the buyer. It will not be returned to the original owner in the Year of Jubilee.
03Lv 25:31 But a house in a village - a settlement without fortified walls - will be treated like property in the countryside. Such a house may be bought back at any time, and it must be returned to the original owner in the Year of Jubilee.
03Lv 25:32 "The Levites always have the right to buy back a house they have sold within the towns allotted to them.
03Lv 25:33 And any property that is sold by the Levites - all houses within the Levitical towns - must be returned in the Year of Jubilee. After all, the houses in the towns reserved for the Levites are the only property they own in all Israel.
03Lv 25:34 The open pastureland around the Levitical towns may never be sold. It is their permanent possession.
03Lv 25:35 "If one of your fellow Israelites falls into poverty and cannot support himself, support him as you would a foreigner or a temporary resident and allow him to live with you.
03Lv 25:36 Do not charge interest or make a profit at his expense. Instead, show your fear of God by letting him live with you as your relative.
03Lv 25:37 Remember, do not charge interest on money you lend him or make a profit on food you sell him.
03Lv 25:38 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.
03Lv 25:39 "If one of your fellow Israelites falls into poverty and is forced to sell himself to you, do not treat him as a slave.
03Lv 25:40 Treat him instead as a hired worker or as a temporary resident who lives with you, and he will serve you only until the Year of Jubilee.
03Lv 25:41 At that time he and his children will no longer be obligated to you, and they will return to their clans and go back to the land originally allotted to their ancestors.
03Lv 25:42 The people of Israel are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt, so they must never be sold as slaves.
03Lv 25:43 Show your fear of God by not treating them harshly.
03Lv 25:44 "However, you may purchase male and female slaves from among the nations around you.
03Lv 25:45 You may also purchase the children of temporary residents who live among you, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property,
03Lv 25:46 passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat them as slaves, but you must never treat your fellow Israelites this way.
03Lv 25:47 "Suppose a foreigner or temporary resident becomes rich while living among you. If any of your fellow Israelites fall into poverty and are forced to sell themselves to such a foreigner or to a member of his family,
03Lv 25:48 they still retain the right to be bought back, even after they have been purchased. They may be bought back by a brother,
03Lv 25:49 an uncle, or a cousin. In fact, anyone from the extended family may buy them back. They may also redeem themselves if they have prospered.
03Lv 25:50 They will negotiate the price of their freedom with the person who bought them. The price will be based on the number of years from the time they were sold until the next Year of Jubilee - whatever it would cost to hire a worker for that period of time.
03Lv 25:51 If many years still remain until the jubilee, they will repay the proper proportion of what they received when they sold themselves.
03Lv 25:52 If only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, they will repay a small amount for their redemption.
03Lv 25:53 The foreigner must treat them as workers hired on a yearly basis. You must not allow a foreigner to treat any of your fellow Israelites harshly.
03Lv 25:54 If any Israelites have not been bought back by the time the Year of Jubilee arrives, they and their children must be set free at that time.
03Lv 25:55 For the people of Israel belong to me. They are my servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.
03Lv 26:1 "Do not make idols or set up carved images, or sacred pillars, or sculptured stones in your land so you may worship them. I am the LORD your God.
03Lv 26:2 You must keep my Sabbath days of rest and show reverence for my sanctuary. I am the LORD.
03Lv 26:3 "If you follow my decrees and are careful to obey my commands,
03Lv 26:4 I will send you the seasonal rains. The land will then yield its crops, and the trees of the field will produce their fruit.
03Lv 26:5 Your threshing season will overlap with the grape harvest, and your grape harvest will overlap with the season of planting grain. You will eat your fill and live securely in your own land.
03Lv 26:6 "I will give you peace in the land, and you will be able to sleep with no cause for fear. I will rid the land of wild animals and keep your enemies out of your land.
03Lv 26:7 In fact, you will chase down your enemies and slaughter them with your swords.
03Lv 26:8 Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will chase ten thousand! All your enemies will fall beneath your sword.
03Lv 26:9 "I will look favorably upon you, making you fertile and multiplying your people. And I will fulfill my covenant with you.
03Lv 26:10 You will have such a surplus of crops that you will need to clear out the old grain to make room for the new harvest!
03Lv 26:11 I will live among you, and I will not despise you.
03Lv 26:12 I will walk among you; I will be your God, and you will be my people.
03Lv 26:13 I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so you would no longer be their slaves. I broke the yoke of slavery from your neck so you can walk with your heads held high.
03Lv 26:14 "However, if you do not listen to me or obey all these commands,
03Lv 26:15 and if you break my covenant by rejecting my decrees, treating my regulations with contempt, and refusing to obey my commands,
03Lv 26:16 I will punish you. I will bring sudden terrors upon you - wasting diseases and burning fevers that will cause your eyes to fail and your life to ebb away. You will plant your crops in vain because your enemies will eat them.
03Lv 26:17 I will turn against you, and you will be defeated by your enemies. Those who hate you will rule over you, and you will run even when no one is chasing you!
03Lv 26:18 "And if, in spite of all this, you still disobey me, I will punish you seven times over for your sins.
03Lv 26:19 I will break your proud spirit by making the skies as unyielding as iron and the earth as hard as bronze.
03Lv 26:20 All your work will be for nothing, for your land will yield no crops, and your trees will bear no fruit.
03Lv 26:21 "If even then you remain hostile toward me and refuse to obey me, I will inflict disaster on you seven times over for your sins.
03Lv 26:22 I will send wild animals that will rob you of your children and destroy your livestock. Your numbers will dwindle, and your roads will be deserted.
03Lv 26:23 "And if you fail to learn the lesson and continue your hostility toward me,
03Lv 26:24 then I myself will be hostile toward you. I will personally strike you with calamity seven times over for your sins.
03Lv 26:25 I will send armies against you to carry out the curse of the covenant you have broken. When you run to your towns for safety, I will send a plague to destroy you there, and you will be handed over to your enemies.
03Lv 26:26 I will destroy your food supply, so that ten women will need only one oven to bake bread for their families. They will ration your food by weight, and though you have food to eat, you will not be satisfied.
03Lv 26:27 "If in spite of all this you still refuse to listen and still remain hostile toward me,
03Lv 26:28 then I will give full vent to my hostility. I myself will punish you seven times over for your sins.
03Lv 26:29 Then you will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters.
03Lv 26:30 I will destroy your pagan shrines and knock down your places of worship. I will leave your lifeless corpses piled on top of your lifeless idols��, and I will despise you. / ��The Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung
03Lv 26:31 I will make your cities desolate and destroy your places of pagan worship. I will take no pleasure in your offerings that should be a pleasing aroma to me.
03Lv 26:32 Yes, I myself will devastate your land, and your enemies who come to occupy it will be appalled at what they see.
03Lv 26:33 I will scatter you among the nations and bring out my sword against you. Your land will become desolate, and your cities will lie in ruins.
03Lv 26:34 Then at last the land will enjoy its neglected Sabbath years as it lies desolate while you are in exile in the land of your enemies. Then the land will finally rest and enjoy the Sabbaths it missed.
03Lv 26:35 As long as the land lies in ruins, it will enjoy the rest you never allowed it to take every seventh year while you lived in it.
03Lv 26:36 "And for those of you who survive, I will demoralize you in the land of your enemies. You will live in such fear that the sound of a leaf driven by the wind will send you fleeing. You will run as though fleeing from a sword, and you will fall even when no one pursues you.
03Lv 26:37 Though no one is chasing you, you will stumble over each other as though fleeing from a sword. You will have no power to stand up against your enemies.
03Lv 26:38 You will die among the foreign nations and be devoured in the land of your enemies.
03Lv 26:39 Those of you who survive will waste away in your enemies' lands because of their sins and the sins of their ancestors.
03Lv 26:40 "But at last my people will confess their sins and the sins of their ancestors for betraying me and being hostile toward me.
03Lv 26:41 When I have turned their hostility back on them and brought them to the land of their enemies, then at last their stubborn hearts will be humbled, and they will pay for their sins.
03Lv 26:42 Then I will remember my covenant with Jacob and my covenant with Isaac and my covenant with Abraham, and I will remember the land.
03Lv 26:43 For the land must be abandoned to enjoy its years of Sabbath rest as it lies deserted. At last the people will pay for their sins, for they have continually rejected my regulations and despised my decrees.
03Lv 26:44 "But despite all this, I will not utterly reject or despise them while they are in exile in the land of their enemies. I will not cancel my covenant with them by wiping them out, for I am the LORD their God.
03Lv 26:45 For their sakes I will remember my ancient covenant with their ancestors, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of all the nations, that I might be their God. I am the LORD."
03Lv 26:46 These are the decrees, regulations, and instructions that the LORD gave through Moses on Mount Sinai as evidence of the relationship between himself and the Israelites.
03Lv 27:1 The LORD said to Moses,
03Lv 27:2 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel. If anyone makes a special vow to dedicate someone to the LORD by paying the value of that person,
03Lv 27:3 here is the scale of values to be used. A man between the ages of twenty and sixty is valued at fifty shekels�� of silver, as measured by the sanctuary shekel. / ��Or 20 ounces [570 grams]
03Lv 27:4 A woman of that age is valued at thirty shekels�� of silver. / ��Or 12 ounces [342 grams]
03Lv 27:5 A boy between the ages of five and twenty is valued at twenty shekels of silver; a girl of that age is valued at ten shekels�� of silver. / ��Or A boy . . . 8 ounces [228 grams] of silver; a girl . . . 4 ounces [114 grams]
03Lv 27:6 A boy between the ages of one month and five years is valued at five shekels of silver; a girl of that age is valued at three shekels�� of silver. / ��Or A boy . . . 2 ounces [57 grams] of silver; a girl . . . 1.2 ounces [34 grams]
03Lv 27:7 A man older than sixty is valued at fifteen shekels of silver; a woman of that age is valued at ten shekels�� of silver. / ��Or A man . . . 6 ounces [171 grams] of silver; a woman . . . 4 ounces [114 grams]
03Lv 27:8 If you desire to make such a vow but cannot afford to pay the required amount, take the person to the priest. He will determine the amount for you to pay based on what you can afford.
03Lv 27:9 "If your vow involves giving an animal that is acceptable as an offering to the LORD, any gift to the LORD will be considered holy.
03Lv 27:10 You may not exchange or substitute it for another animal - neither a good animal for a bad one nor a bad animal for a good one. But if you do exchange one animal for another, then both the original animal and its substitute will be considered holy.
03Lv 27:11 If your vow involves an unclean animal - one that is not acceptable as an offering to the LORD - then you must bring the animal to the priest.
03Lv 27:12 He will assess its value, and his assessment will be final, whether high or low.
03Lv 27:13 If you want to buy back the animal, you must pay the value set by the priest, plus 20 percent.
03Lv 27:14 "If someone dedicates a house to the LORD, the priest will come to assess its value. The priest's assessment will be final, whether high or low.
03Lv 27:15 If the person who dedicated the house wants to buy it back, he must pay the value set by the priest, plus 20 percent. Then the house will again be his.
03Lv 27:16 "If someone dedicates to the LORD a piece of his family property, its value will be assessed according to the amount of seed required to plant it - fifty shekels of silver for a field planted with five bushels of barley seed��. / ��Hebrew 50 shekels [20 ounces, or 570 grams] of silver for a homer [182 liters] of barley seed
03Lv 27:17 If the field is dedicated to the LORD in the Year of Jubilee, then the entire assessment will apply.
03Lv 27:18 But if the field is dedicated after the Year of Jubilee, the priest will assess the land's value in proportion to the number of years left until the next Year of Jubilee. Its assessed value is reduced each year.
03Lv 27:19 If the person who dedicated the field wants to buy it back, he must pay the value set by the priest, plus 20 percent. Then the field will again be legally his.
03Lv 27:20 But if he does not want to buy it back, and it is sold to someone else, the field can no longer be bought back.
03Lv 27:21 When the field is released in the Year of Jubilee, it will be holy, a field specially set apart�� for the LORD. It will become the property of the priests. / ��The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; also in 27.28, 29
03Lv 27:22 "If someone dedicates to the LORD a field he has purchased but which is not part of his family property,
03Lv 27:23 the priest will assess its value based on the number of years left until the next Year of Jubilee. On that day he must give the assessed value of the land as a sacred donation to the LORD.
03Lv 27:24 In the Year of Jubilee the field must be returned to the person from whom he purchased it, the one who inherited it as family property.
03Lv 27:25 (All the payments must be measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel��, which equals twenty gerahs.) / ��Each shekel was about 0.4 ounces [11 grams] in weight
03Lv 27:26 "You may not dedicate a firstborn animal to the LORD, for the firstborn of your cattle, sheep, and goats already belong to him.
03Lv 27:27 However, you may buy back the firstborn of a ceremonially unclean animal by paying the priest's assessment of its worth, plus 20 percent. If you do not buy it back, the priest will sell it at its assessed value.
03Lv 27:28 "However, anything specially set apart for the LORD - whether a person, an animal, or family property - must never be sold or bought back. Anything devoted in this way has been set apart as holy, and it belongs to the LORD.
03Lv 27:29 No person specially set apart for destruction may be bought back. Such a person must be put to death.
03Lv 27:30 "One tenth of the produce of the land, whether grain from the fields or fruit from the trees, belongs to the LORD and must be set apart to him as holy.
03Lv 27:31 If you want to buy back the LORD's tenth of the grain or fruit, you must pay its value, plus 20 percent.
03Lv 27:32 Count off every tenth animal from your herds and flocks and set them apart for the LORD as holy.
03Lv 27:33 You may not pick and choose between good and bad animals, and you may not substitute one for another. But if you do exchange one animal for another, then both the original animal and its substitute will be considered holy and cannot be bought back."
03Lv 27:34 These are the commands that the LORD gave through Moses on Mount Sinai for the Israelites.
04
04Nm 1:1 A year after Israel's departure from Egypt, the LORD spoke to Moses in the Tabernacle�� in the wilderness of Sinai. On the first day of the second month�� of that year he said, / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting ��This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in April or May
04Nm 1:2 "From the whole community of Israel, record the names of all the warriors by their clans and families. List all the men
04Nm 1:3 twenty years old or older who are able to go to war. You and Aaron must register the troops,
04Nm 1:4 and you will be assisted by one family leader from each tribe.
04Nm 1:5 "These are the tribes and the names of the leaders who will assist you�� Tribe Leader Reuben Elizur son of Shedeur 
04Nm 1:6 Simeon Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai 
04Nm 1:7 Judah Nahshon son of Amminadab 
04Nm 1:8 Issachar Nethanel son of Zuar 
04Nm 1:9 Zebulun Eliab son of Helon 
04Nm 1:10 Ephraim son of Joseph Elishama son of Ammihud Manasseh son of Joseph Gamaliel son of Pedahzur 
04Nm 1:11 Benjamin Abidan son of Gideoni 
04Nm 1:12 Dan Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai 
04Nm 1:13 Asher Pagiel son of Ocran 
04Nm 1:14 Gad Eliasaph son of Deuel 
04Nm 1:15 Naphtali Ahira son of Enan 
04Nm 1:16 These are the chosen leaders of the community, the leaders of their ancestral tribes, the heads of the clans of Israel."
04Nm 1:17 So Moses and Aaron called together these chosen leaders,
04Nm 1:18 and they assembled the whole community of Israel on that very day��. All the people were registered according to their ancestry by their clans and families. The men of Israel who were twenty years old or older were listed one by one, / ��Hebrew on the first day of the second month; see 1.1
04Nm 1:19 just as the LORD had commanded Moses. So Moses recorded their names in the wilderness of Sinai.
04Nm 1:20 This is the number of men twenty years old or older who were able to go to war, as their names were listed in the records of their clans and families�磺  / ��In the Hebrew text, this sentence (This is the number of men twenty years old or older who were able to go to war, as their names were listed in the records of their clans and families) is repeated in 1.22, 24, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, 42
04Nm 1:21 Tribe Number Reuben (Jacob's�� oldest son) 46,500  / ��Hebrew Israel's. The names "Jacob" and "Israel" are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation
04Nm 1:22 Simeon

04Nm 1:24 Gad 
04Nm 1:25 45,650 
04Nm 1:26 Judah 
04Nm 1:27 74,600 
04Nm 1:28 Issachar
04Nm 1:29 54,400 
04Nm 1:30 Zebulun
04Nm 1:31 57,400
04Nm 1:32 Ephraim son of Joseph
04Nm 1:33 40,500
04Nm 1:34 Manasseh son of Joseph

04Nm 1:38 Dan 
04Nm 1:39 62,700 
04Nm 1:40 Asher 
04Nm 1:41 41,500 
04Nm 1:42 Naphtali 
04Nm 1:43 53,400 
04Nm 1:44 These were the men registered by Moses and Aaron and the twelve leaders of Israel, all listed according to their ancestral descent.
04Nm 1:45 They were registered by families - all the men of Israel who were twenty years old or older and able to go to war.
04Nm 1:46 The total number was 603,550.
04Nm 1:47 But this total did not include the Levites.
04Nm 1:48 For the LORD had said to Moses,
04Nm 1:49 "Do not include the tribe of Levi in the registration; do not count them with the rest of the Israelites.
04Nm 1:50 Put the Levites in charge of the Tabernacle of the Covenant��, along with all its furnishings and equipment. They must carry the Tabernacle and all its furnishings as you travel, and they must take care of it and camp around it. / ��Or Tabernacle of the Testimony; also in 1.53
04Nm 1:51 Whenever it is time for the Tabernacle to move, the Levites will take it down. And when it is time to stop, they will set it up again. But any unauthorized person who goes too near the Tabernacle must be put to death.
04Nm 1:52 Each tribe of Israel will camp in a designated area with its own family banner.
04Nm 1:53 But the Levites will camp around the Tabernacle of the Covenant to protect the community of Israel from the LORD's anger. The Levites are responsible to stand guard around the Tabernacle."
04Nm 1:54 So the Israelites did everything just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 2:1 Then the LORD gave these instructions to Moses and Aaron.
04Nm 2:2 "When the Israelites set up camp, each tribe will be assigned its own area. The tribal divisions will camp beneath their family banners on all four sides of the Tabernacle��, but at some distance from it. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting; also in 2.17
04Nm 2:3 "The divisions of Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun are to camp toward the sunrise on the east side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names of the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops�� Judah Nahshon son of Amminadab
04Nm 2:4 74,600 
04Nm 2:5 Issachar Nethanel son of Zuar
04Nm 2:6 54,400 
04Nm 2:7 Zebulun Eliab son of Helon
04Nm 2:8 57,400 
04Nm 2:9 So the total of all the troops on Judah's side of the camp is 186,400. These three tribes are to lead the way whenever the Israelites travel to a new campsite.
04Nm 2:10 "The divisions of Reuben, Simeon, and Gad are to camp on the south side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names of the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops�� Reuben Elizur son of Shedeur
04Nm 2:11 46,500 
04Nm 2:12 Simeon Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai
04Nm 2:13 59,300 
04Nm 2:14 Gad Eliasaph son of Deuel�� / ��As in many Hebrew manuscripts, Samaritan Pentateuch, and Latin Vulgate (see also 1.14); most Hebrew manuscripts read son of Reuel
04Nm 2:15 45,650 
04Nm 2:16 So the total of all the troops on Reuben's side of the camp is 151,450. These three tribes will be second in line whenever the Israelites travel.
04Nm 2:17 "Then the Tabernacle, carried by the Levites, will set out from the middle of the camp. All the tribes are to travel in the same order that they camp, each in position under the appropriate family banner.
04Nm 2:18 "The divisions of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Benjamin are to camp on the west side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names of the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops�� Ephraim Elishama son of Ammihud 
04Nm 2:19 40,500 
04Nm 2:20 Manasseh Gamaliel son of Pedahzur 
04Nm 2:21 32,200 
04Nm 2:22 Benjamin Abidan son of Gideoni
04Nm 2:23 35,400 
04Nm 2:24 So the total of all the troops on Ephraim's side of the camp is 108,100. These three tribes will be third in line whenever the Israelites travel.
04Nm 2:25 "The divisions of Dan, Asher, and Naphtali are to camp on the north side of the Tabernacle, beneath their family banners. These are the names of the tribes, their leaders, and the numbers of their registered troops�� Dan Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai 
04Nm 2:26 62,700 
04Nm 2:27 Asher Pagiel son of Ocran
04Nm 2:29 41,500 
04Nm 2:29 Naphtali Ahira son of Enan
04Nm 2:30 53,400 
04Nm 2:31 So the total of all the troops on Dan's side of the camp is 157,600. These three tribes will be last, marching under their banners whenever the Israelites travel."
04Nm 2:32 In summary, the troops of Israel listed by their families totaled 603,550.
04Nm 2:33 But as the LORD had commanded, the Levites were not included in this registration.
04Nm 2:34 So the people of Israel did everything as the LORD had commanded Moses. Each clan and family set up camp and marched under their banners exactly as the LORD had instructed them.
04Nm 3:1 This is the family line of Aaron and Moses as it was recorded when the LORD spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai.
04Nm 3:2 The names of Aaron's sons were Nadab (the oldest), Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
04Nm 3:3 These sons of Aaron were anointed and ordained to minister as priests.
04Nm 3:4 But Nadab and Abihu died in the LORD's presence in the wilderness of Sinai when they burned before the LORD the wrong kind of fire, different than he had commanded. Since they had no sons, this left only Eleazar and Ithamar to serve as priests with their father, Aaron.
04Nm 3:5 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 3:6 "Call forward the tribe of Levi, and present them to Aaron the priest to serve as his assistants.
04Nm 3:7 They will serve Aaron and the whole community, performing their sacred duties in and around the Tabernacle��. / ��Hebrew around the Tent of Meeting, doing service at the Tabernacle
04Nm 3:8 They will also maintain all the furnishings of the sacred tent��, serving in the Tabernacle on behalf of all the Israelites. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting; also in 3.25
04Nm 3:9 Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons. They have been given from among all the people of Israel to serve as their assistants.
04Nm 3:10 Appoint Aaron and his sons to carry out the duties of the priesthood. But any unauthorized person who goes too near the sanctuary must be put to death."
04Nm 3:11 And the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 3:12 "Look, I have chosen the Levites from among the Israelites to serve as substitutes for all the firstborn sons of the people of Israel. The Levites belong to me,
04Nm 3:13 for all the firstborn males are mine. On the day I struck down all the firstborn sons of the Egyptians, I set apart for myself all the firstborn in Israel, both of people and of animals. They are mine; I am the LORD."
04Nm 3:14 The LORD spoke again to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai. He said,
04Nm 3:15 "Record the names of the members of the tribe of Levi by their families and clans. List every male who is one month old or older."
04Nm 3:16 So Moses listed them, just as the LORD had commanded.
04Nm 3:17 Levi had three sons, whose names were Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
04Nm 3:18 The clans descended from Gershon were named after two of his descendants, Libni and Shimei.
04Nm 3:19 The clans descended from Kohath were named after four of his descendants, Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
04Nm 3:20 The clans descended from Merari were named after two of his descendants, Mahli and Mushi.These were the Levite clans, listed according to their family groups.
04Nm 3:21 The descendants of Gershon were composed of the clans descended from Libni and Shimei.
04Nm 3:22 There were 7,500 males one month old or older among these Gershonite clans.
04Nm 3:23 They were assigned the area to the west of the Tabernacle for their camp.
04Nm 3:24 The leader of the Gershonite clans was Eliasaph son of Lael.
04Nm 3:25 These two clans were responsible to care for the Tabernacle, including the sacred tent with its layers of coverings, the curtain at its entrance,
04Nm 3:26 the curtains of the courtyard that surrounded the Tabernacle and altar, the curtain at the courtyard entrance, the ropes, and all the equipment related to their use.
04Nm 3:27 The descendants of Kohath were composed of the clans descended from Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
04Nm 3:28 There were 8,600�� males one month old or older among these Kohathite clans. They were responsible for the care of the sanctuary, / ��Some Greek manuscripts read 8,300; see total in 3.39
04Nm 3:29 and they were assigned the area south of the Tabernacle for their camp.
04Nm 3:30 The leader of the Kohathite clans was Elizaphan son of Uzziel.
04Nm 3:31 These four clans were responsible for the care of the Ark, the table, the lampstand, the altars, the various articles used in the sanctuary, the inner curtain, and all the equipment related to their use.
04Nm 3:32 Eleazar, son of Aaron the priest, was the chief administrator over all the Levites, with special responsibility for the oversight of the sanctuary.
04Nm 3:33 The descendants of Merari were composed of the clans descended from Mahli and Mushi.
04Nm 3:34 There were 6,200 males one month old or older among these Merarite clans.
04Nm 3:35 They were assigned the area north of the Tabernacle for their camp. The leader of the Merarite clans was Zuriel son of Abihail.
04Nm 3:36 These two clans were responsible for the care of the frames supporting the Tabernacle, the crossbars, the pillars, the bases, and all the equipment related to their use.
04Nm 3:37 They were also responsible for the posts of the courtyard and all their bases, pegs, and ropes.
04Nm 3:38 The area in front of the Tabernacle, in the east toward the sunrise��, was reserved for the tents of Moses and of Aaron and his sons, who had the final responsibility for the sanctuary on behalf of the people of Israel. Anyone other than a priest or Levite who went too near the sanctuary was to be put to death. / ��Hebrew toward the sunrise, in front of the Tent of Meeting
04Nm 3:39 When Moses and Aaron counted the Levite clans at the LORD's command, the total number was 22,000 males one month old or older.
04Nm 3:40 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Now count all the firstborn sons in Israel who are one month old or older, and make a list of their names.
04Nm 3:41 The Levites must be reserved for me as substitutes for the firstborn sons of Israel; I am the LORD. And the Levites' livestock must be reserved for me as substitutes for the firstborn livestock of the whole nation of Israel."
04Nm 3:42 So Moses counted the firstborn sons of the people of Israel, just as the LORD had commanded.
04Nm 3:43 The number of firstborn sons who were one month old or older was 22,273.
04Nm 3:44 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 3:45 "Take the Levites as substitutes for the firstborn sons of the people of Israel. And take the livestock of the Levites as substitutes for the firstborn livestock of the people of Israel. The Levites belong to me; I am the LORD.
04Nm 3:46 There are 273 more firstborn sons of Israel than there are Levites. To redeem these extra firstborn sons,
04Nm 3:47 collect five pieces of silver�� for each of them (each piece weighing the same as the sanctuary shekel, which equals twenty gerahs). / ��Hebrew 5 shekels [2 ounces or 57 grams]
04Nm 3:48 Give the silver to Aaron and his sons as the redemption price for the extra firstborn sons."
04Nm 3:49 So Moses collected the silver for redeeming the firstborn sons of Israel who exceeded the number of Levites.
04Nm 3:50 He collected 1,365 pieces of silver�� on behalf of these firstborn sons of Israel (each piece weighing the same as the sanctuary shekel). / ��Hebrew 1,365 shekels [34 pounds or 15.5 kilograms]
04Nm 3:51 And Moses gave the silver for the redemption to Aaron and his sons, just as the LORD had commanded.
04Nm 4:1 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
04Nm 4:2 "Record the names of the members of the clans and families of the Kohathite division of the tribe of Levi.
04Nm 4:3 List all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are eligible to serve in the Tabernacle��. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting; also in 4.4, 15, 23, 25, 28, 30, 31, 33, 35, 37, 39, 41, 43, 47
04Nm 4:4 "The duties of the Kohathites at the Tabernacle will relate to the most sacred objects.
04Nm 4:5 When the camp moves, Aaron and his sons must enter the Tabernacle first to take down the inner curtain and cover the Ark of the Covenant�� with it. / ��Or Ark of the Testimony
04Nm 4:6 Then they must cover the inner curtain with fine goatskin leather and spread over that a single piece of blue cloth. Finally, they must put the carrying poles of the Ark in place.
04Nm 4:7 "Next they must spread a blue cloth over the table where the Bread of the Presence is displayed, and on the cloth they will place the bowls, pans, jars, pitchers, and the special bread.
04Nm 4:8 They must spread a scarlet cloth over all of this, and finally a covering of fine goatskin leather on top of the scarlet cloth. Then they must insert the carrying poles into the table.
04Nm 4:9 "Next they must cover the lampstand with a blue cloth, along with its lamps, lamp snuffers, trays, and special jars of olive oil.
04Nm 4:10 Then they must cover the lampstand and its accessories with fine goatskin leather and place the bundle on a carrying frame.
04Nm 4:11 "Next they must spread a blue cloth over the gold incense altar and cover this cloth with fine goatskin leather. Then they must attach the carrying poles to the altar.
04Nm 4:12 They must take all the remaining furnishings of the sanctuary and wrap them in a blue cloth, cover them with fine goatskin leather, and place them on the carrying frame.
04Nm 4:13 "They must remove the ashes from the altar for sacrifices and cover the altar with a purple cloth.
04Nm 4:14 All the altar utensils - the firepans, meat forks, shovels, basins, and all the containers - must be placed on the cloth, and a covering of fine goatskin leather must be spread over them. Finally, they must put the carrying poles in place.
04Nm 4:15 The camp will be ready to move when Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the sacred articles. The Kohathites will come and carry these things to the next destination. But they must not touch the sacred objects, or they will die. So these are the things from the Tabernacle that the Kohathites must carry.
04Nm 4:16 "Eleazar son of Aaron the priest will be responsible for the oil of the lampstand, the fragrant incense, the daily grain offering, and the anointing oil. In fact, Eleazar will be responsible for the entire Tabernacle and everything in it, including the sanctuary and its furnishings."
04Nm 4:17 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
04Nm 4:18 "Do not let the Kohathite clans be destroyed from among the Levites!
04Nm 4:19 This is what you must do so they will live and not die when they approach the most sacred objects. Aaron and his sons must always go in with them and assign a specific duty or load to each person.
04Nm 4:20 The Kohathites must never enter the sanctuary to look at the sacred objects for even a moment, or they will die."
04Nm 4:21 And the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 4:22 "Record the names of the members of the clans and families of the Gershonite division of the tribe of Levi.
04Nm 4:23 List all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are eligible to serve in the Tabernacle.
04Nm 4:24 "These Gershonite clans will be responsible for general service and carrying loads.
04Nm 4:25 They must carry the curtains of the Tabernacle, the Tabernacle itself with its coverings, the outer covering of fine goatskin leather, and the curtain for the Tabernacle entrance.
04Nm 4:26 They are also to carry the curtains for the courtyard walls that surround the Tabernacle and altar, the curtain across the courtyard entrance, the ropes, and all the equipment related to their use. The Gershonites are responsible for all these items.
04Nm 4:27 Aaron and his sons will direct the Gershonites regarding all their duties, whether it involves moving the equipment or doing other work. They must assign the Gershonites responsibility for the loads they are to carry.
04Nm 4:28 So these are the duties assigned to the Gershonite clans at the Tabernacle. They will be directly responsible to Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
04Nm 4:29 "Now record the names of the members of the clans and families of the Merarite division of the tribe of Levi.
04Nm 4:30 List all the men between the ages of thirty and fifty who are eligible to serve in the Tabernacle.
04Nm 4:31 "Their only duty at the Tabernacle will be to carry loads. They will carry the frames of the Tabernacle, the crossbars, the posts, and the bases;
04Nm 4:32 also the posts for the courtyard walls with their bases, pegs, and ropes; and all the accessories and everything else related to their use. Assign the various loads to each man by name.
04Nm 4:33 So these are the duties of the Merarite clans at the Tabernacle. They are directly responsible to Ithamar son of Aaron the priest."
04Nm 4:34 So Moses, Aaron, and the other leaders of the community listed the members of the Kohathite division by their clans and families.
04Nm 4:35 The list included all the men between thirty and fifty years of age who were eligible for service in the Tabernacle,
04Nm 4:36 and the total number came to 2,750.
04Nm 4:37 So this was the total of all those from the Kohathite clans who were eligible to serve at the Tabernacle. Moses and Aaron listed them, just as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
04Nm 4:38 The Gershonite division was also listed by its clans and families.
04Nm 4:39 The list included all the men between thirty and fifty years of age who were eligible for service in the Tabernacle,
04Nm 4:40 and the total number came to 2,630.
04Nm 4:41 So this was the total of all those from the Gershonite clans who were eligible to serve at the Tabernacle. Moses and Aaron listed them, just as the LORD had commanded.
04Nm 4:42 The Merarite division was also listed by its clans and families.
04Nm 4:43 The list included all the men between thirty and fifty years of age who were eligible for service in the Tabernacle,
04Nm 4:44 and the total number came to 3,200.
04Nm 4:45 So this was the total of all those from the Merarite clans who were eligible for service. Moses and Aaron listed them, just as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
04Nm 4:46 So Moses, Aaron, and the leaders of Israel listed all the Levites by their clans and families.
04Nm 4:47 All the men between thirty and fifty years of age who were eligible for service in the Tabernacle and for its transportation
04Nm 4:48 numbered 8,580.
04Nm 4:49 When their names were recorded, as the LORD had commanded through Moses, each man was assigned his task and told what to carry. And so the registration was completed, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 5:1 The LORD gave these instructions to Moses.
04Nm 5:2 "Command the people of Israel to remove from the camp anyone who has a skin disease�� or a discharge, or who has become ceremonially unclean by touching a dead person. / ��Traditionally rendered leprosy. The Hebrew word used here describes various skin diseases
04Nm 5:3 This command applies to men and women alike. Remove them so they will not defile the camp in which I live among them."
04Nm 5:4 So the Israelites did as the LORD had commanded Moses and removed such people from the camp.
04Nm 5:5 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 5:6 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel�� If any of the people - men or women - betray the LORD by doing wrong to another person, they are guilty.
04Nm 5:7 They must confess their sin and make full restitution for what they have done, adding an additional 20 percent and returning it to the person who was wronged.
04Nm 5:8 But if the person who was wronged is dead, and there are no near relatives to whom restitution can be made, the payment belongs to the LORD and must be given to the priest. Those who are guilty must also bring a ram as a sacrifice, and they will be purified and made right with the LORD��. / ��Or bring a ram for atonement, which will make atonement for them
04Nm 5:9 All the sacred offerings that the Israelites bring to a priest will belong to him.
04Nm 5:10 Each priest may keep all the sacred donations that he receives."
04Nm 5:11 And the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 5:12 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel."Suppose a man's wife goes astray, and she is unfaithful to her husband
04Nm 5:13 and has sex with another man, but neither her husband nor anyone else knows about it. She has defiled herself, even though there was no witness and she was not caught in the act.
04Nm 5:14 If her husband becomes jealous and is suspicious of his wife and needs to know whether or not she has defiled herself,
04Nm 5:15 the husband must bring his wife to the priest. He must also bring an offering of two quarts�� of barley flour to be presented on her behalf. Do not mix it with olive oil or frankincense, for it is a jealousy offering - an offering to prove whether or not she is guilty. / ��Hebrew 1/10 of an ephah [2.2 liters]
04Nm 5:16 "The priest will then present her to stand trial before the LORD.
04Nm 5:17 He must take some holy water in a clay jar and pour into it dust he has taken from the Tabernacle floor.
04Nm 5:18 When the priest has presented the woman before the LORD, he must unbind her hair and place in her hands the offering of proof - the jealousy offering to determine whether her husband's suspicions are justified. The priest will stand before her, holding the jar of bitter water that brings a curse to those who are guilty.
04Nm 5:19 The priest will then put the woman under oath and say to her, 'If no other man has had sex with you, and you have not gone astray and defiled yourself while under your husband's authority, may you be immune from the effects of this bitter water that brings on the curse.
04Nm 5:20 But if you have gone astray by being unfaithful to your husband, and have defiled yourself by having sex with another man - '
04Nm 5:21 "At this point the priest must put the woman under oath by saying, 'May the people know that the LORD's curse is upon you when he makes you infertile, causing your womb to shrivel�� and your abdomen to swell. / ��Hebrew when he causes your thigh to waste away
04Nm 5:22 Now may this water that brings the curse enter your body and cause your abdomen to swell and your womb to shrivel��.' And the woman will be required to say, 'Yes, let it be so.' / ��Hebrew and your thigh to waste away
04Nm 5:23 And the priest will write these curses on a piece of leather and wash them off into the bitter water.
04Nm 5:24 He will make the woman drink the bitter water that brings on the curse. When the water enters her body, it will cause bitter suffering if she is guilty.
04Nm 5:25 "The priest will take the jealousy offering from the woman's hand, lift it up before the LORD, and carry it to the altar.
04Nm 5:26 He will take a handful of the flour as a token portion and burn it on the altar, and he will require the woman to drink the water.
04Nm 5:27 If she has defiled herself by being unfaithful to her husband, the water that brings on the curse will cause bitter suffering. Her abdomen will swell and her womb will shrink��, and her name will become a curse among her people. / ��Hebrew and her thigh will waste away
04Nm 5:28 But if she has not defiled herself and is pure, then she will be unharmed and will still be able to have children.
04Nm 5:29 "This is the ritual law for dealing with suspicion. If a woman goes astray and defiles herself while under her husband's authority,
04Nm 5:30 or if a man becomes jealous and is suspicious that his wife has been unfaithful, the husband must present his wife before the LORD, and the priest will apply this entire ritual law to her.
04Nm 5:31 The husband will be innocent of any guilt in this matter, but his wife will be held accountable for her sin."
04Nm 6:1 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel.
04Nm 6:2 "If any of the people, either men or women, take the special vow of a Nazirite, setting themselves apart to the LORD in a special way,
04Nm 6:3 they must give up wine and other alcoholic drinks. They must not use vinegar made from wine or from other alcoholic drinks, they must not drink fresh grape juice, and they must not eat grapes or raisins.
04Nm 6:4 As long as they are bound by their Nazirite vow, they are not allowed to eat or drink anything that comes from a grapevine - not even the grape seeds or skins.
04Nm 6:5 "They must never cut their hair throughout the time of their vow, for they are holy and set apart to the LORD. Until the time of their vow has been fulfilled, they must let their hair grow long.
04Nm 6:6 And they must not go near a dead body during the entire period of their vow to the LORD.
04Nm 6:7 Even if the dead person is their own father, mother, brother, or sister, they must not defile themselves, for the hair on their head is the symbol of their separation to God.
04Nm 6:8 This requirement applies as long as they are set apart to the LORD.
04Nm 6:9 "If someone falls dead beside them, the hair they have dedicated will be defiled. They must wait for seven days and then shave their heads. Then they will be cleansed from their defilement.
04Nm 6:10 On the eighth day they must bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the Tabernacle��. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting; also in 6.13, 18
04Nm 6:11 The priest will offer one of the birds for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering. In this way, he will purify them�� from the guilt they incurred through contact with the dead body. Then they must reaffirm their commitment and let their hair begin to grow again. / ��Or make atonement for them
04Nm 6:12 The days of their vow that were completed before their defilement no longer count. They must rededicate themselves to the LORD as a Nazirite for the full term of their vow, and each must bring a one-year-old male lamb for a guilt offering.
04Nm 6:13 "This is the ritual law for Nazirites. At the conclusion of their time of separation as Nazirites, they must each go to the entrance of the Tabernacle
04Nm 6:14 and offer their sacrifices to the LORD�� a one-year-old male lamb without defect for a burnt offering, a one-year-old female lamb without defect for a sin offering, a ram without defect for a peace offering,
04Nm 6:15 a basket of bread made without yeast - cakes of choice flour mixed with olive oil and wafers spread with olive oil - along with their prescribed grain offerings and liquid offerings.
04Nm 6:16 The priest will present these offerings before the LORD�� first the sin offering and the burnt offering;
04Nm 6:17 then the ram for a peace offering, along with the basket of bread made without yeast. The priest must also present the prescribed grain offering and liquid offering to the LORD.
04Nm 6:18 "Then the Nazirites will shave their heads at the entrance of the Tabernacle. They will take the hair that had been dedicated and place it on the fire beneath the peace-offering sacrifice.
04Nm 6:19 After the Nazirite's head has been shaved, the priest will take for each of them the boiled shoulder of the ram, and he will take from the basket a cake and a wafer made without yeast. He will put them all into the Nazirite's hands.
04Nm 6:20 Then the priest will lift them up as a special offering before the LORD. These are holy portions for the priest, along with the breast of the special offering and the thigh of the sacred offering that are lifted up before the LORD. After this ceremony the Nazirites may again drink wine.
04Nm 6:21 "This is the ritual law of the Nazirites, who vow to bring these offerings to the LORD. They may also bring additional offerings if they can afford it. And they must be careful to do whatever they vowed when they set themselves apart as Nazirites."
04Nm 6:22 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 6:23 "Tell Aaron and his sons to bless the people of Israel with this special blessing.
04Nm 6:24 'May the LORD bless you and protect you.
04Nm 6:25 May the LORD smile on you and be gracious to you.
04Nm 6:26 May the LORD show you his favor and give you his peace.'
04Nm 6:27 Whenever Aaron and his sons bless the people of Israel in my name, I myself will bless them."
04Nm 7:1 On the day Moses set up the Tabernacle, he anointed it and set it apart as holy. He also anointed and set apart all its furnishings and the altar with its utensils.
04Nm 7:2 Then the leaders of Israel - the tribal leaders who had registered the troops - came and brought their offerings.
04Nm 7:3 Together they brought six large wagons and twelve oxen. There was a wagon for every two leaders and an ox for each leader. They presented these to the LORD in front of the Tabernacle.
04Nm 7:4 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 7:5 "Receive their gifts, and use these oxen and wagons for transporting the Tabernacle��. Distribute them among the Levites according to the work they have to do." / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting; also in 7.89
04Nm 7:6 So Moses took the wagons and oxen and presented them to the Levites.
04Nm 7:7 He gave two wagons and four oxen to the Gershonite division for their work,
04Nm 7:8 and he gave four wagons and eight oxen to the Merarite division for their work. All their work was done under the leadership of Ithamar son of Aaron the priest.
04Nm 7:9 But he gave none of the wagons or oxen to the Kohathite division, since they were required to carry the sacred objects of the Tabernacle on their shoulders.
04Nm 7:10 The leaders also presented dedication gifts for the altar at the time it was anointed. They each placed their gifts before the altar.
04Nm 7:11 The LORD said to Moses, "Let one leader bring his gift each day for the dedication of the altar."
04Nm 7:12 On the first day Nahshon son of Amminadab, leader of the tribe of Judah, presented his offering.
04Nm 7:13 His offering consisted of a silver platter weighing 3 1/4 pounds and a silver basin weighing 1 3/4 pounds�� (as measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel). These were both filled with grain offerings of choice flour moistened with olive oil. / ��Hebrew silver platter weighing 130 shekels [1.5 kilograms] and a silver basin weighing 70 shekels [800 grams]; also in 7.19, 25, 31, 37, 43, 49, 55, 61, 67, 73, 79, 85
04Nm 7:14 He also brought a gold container weighing four ounces��, which was filled with incense. / ��Hebrew 10 shekels [114 grams]; also in 7.20, 26, 32, 38, 44, 50, 56, 62, 68, 74, 80, 86

04Nm 7:20 He also brought a gold container weighing four ounces, which was filled with incense.
04Nm 7:21 He brought a young bull, a ram, and a one-year-old male lamb for a burnt offering,
04Nm 7:22 and a male goat for a sin offering.
04Nm 7:23 For a peace offering he brought two bulls, five rams, five male goats, and five one-year-old male lambs. This was the offering brought by Nethanel son of Zuar.
04Nm 7:24 On the third day Eliab son of Helon, leader of the tribe of Zebulun, presented his offering.
04Nm 7:25 His offering consisted of a silver platter weighing 3 1/4 pounds and a silver basin weighing 1 3/4 pounds (as measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel). These were both filled with grain offerings of choice flour moistened with olive oil.
04Nm 7:26 He also brought a gold container weighing four ounces, which was filled with incense.
04Nm 7:27 He brought a young bull, a ram, and a one-year-old male lamb for a burnt offering,
04Nm 7:28 and a male goat for a sin offering.
04Nm 7:29 For a peace offering he brought two bulls, five rams, five male goats, and five one-year-old male lambs. This was the offering brought by Eliab son of Helon.
04Nm 7:30 On the fourth day Elizur son of Shedeur, leader of the tribe of Reuben, presented his offering.
04Nm 7:31 His offering consisted of a silver platter weighing 3 1/4 pounds and a silver basin weighing 1 3/4 pounds (as measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel). These were both filled with grain offerings of choice flour moistened with olive oil.

04Nm 7:89 Whenever Moses went into the Tabernacle to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from between the two cherubim above the Ark's cover - the place of atonement - that rests on the Ark of the Covenant��. The LORD spoke to him from there. / ��Or Ark of the Testimony
04Nm 8:1 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 8:2 "Give Aaron the following instructions�� When you set up the seven lamps in the lampstand, place them so their light shines forward in front of the lampstand."
04Nm 8:3 So Aaron did this. He set up the seven lamps so they reflected their light forward, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 8:4 The entire lampstand, from its base to its decorative blossoms, was made of beaten gold. It was built according to the exact design the LORD had shown Moses.
04Nm 8:5 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 8:6 "Now set the Levites apart from the rest of the people of Israel and make them ceremonially clean.
04Nm 8:7 Do this by sprinkling them with the water of purification, and have them shave their entire body and wash their clothing. Then they will be ceremonially clean.
04Nm 8:8 Have them bring a young bull and a grain offering of choice flour moistened with olive oil, along with a second young bull for a sin offering.
04Nm 8:9 Then assemble the whole community of Israel, and present the Levites at the entrance of the Tabernacle��. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting; also in 8.15, 19, 22, 24, 26
04Nm 8:10 When you present the Levites before the LORD, the people of Israel must lay their hands on them.
04Nm 8:11 Raising his hands, Aaron must then present the Levites to the LORD as a special offering from the people of Israel, thus dedicating them to the LORD's service.
04Nm 8:12 "Next the Levites will lay their hands on the heads of the young bulls. Present one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the LORD, to purify the Levites and make them right with the LORD��. / ��Or to make atonement for the Levites
04Nm 8:13 Then have the Levites stand in front of Aaron and his sons, and raise your hands and present them as a special offering to the LORD.
04Nm 8:14 In this way, you will set the Levites apart from the rest of the people of Israel, and the Levites will belong to me.
04Nm 8:15 After this, they may go into the Tabernacle to do their work, because you have purified them and presented them as a special offering.
04Nm 8:16 "Of all the people of Israel, the Levites are reserved for me. I have claimed them for myself in place of all the firstborn sons of the Israelites; I have taken the Levites as their substitutes.
04Nm 8:17 For all the firstborn males among the people of Israel are mine, both of people and of animals. I set them apart for myself on the day I struck down all the firstborn sons of the Egyptians.
04Nm 8:18 Yes, I have claimed the Levites in place of all the firstborn sons of Israel.
04Nm 8:19 And of all the Israelites, I have assigned the Levites to Aaron and his sons. They will serve in the Tabernacle on behalf of the Israelites and make sacrifices to purify�� the people so no plague will strike them when they approach the sanctuary." / ��Or make atonement for
04Nm 8:20 So Moses, Aaron, and the whole community of Israel dedicated the Levites, carefully following all the LORD's instructions to Moses.
04Nm 8:21 The Levites purified themselves from sin and washed their clothes, and Aaron lifted them up and presented them to the LORD as a special offering. He then offered a sacrifice to purify them and make them right with the LORD��. / ��Or then made atonement for them to purify them
04Nm 8:22 After that the Levites went into the Tabernacle to perform their duties, assisting Aaron and his sons. So they carried out all the commands that the LORD gave Moses concerning the Levites.
04Nm 8:23 The LORD also instructed Moses,
04Nm 8:24 "This is the rule the Levites must follow�� They must begin serving in the Tabernacle at the age of twenty-five,
04Nm 8:25 and they must retire at the age of fifty.
04Nm 8:26 After retirement they may assist their fellow Levites by serving as guards at the Tabernacle, but they may not officiate in the service. This is how you must assign duties to the Levites."
04Nm 9:1 A year after Israel's departure from Egypt, the LORD spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Sinai. In the first month�� of that year he said, / ��The first month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of March and April
04Nm 9:2 "Tell the Israelites to celebrate the Passover at the prescribed time,
04Nm 9:3 at twilight on the fourteenth day of the first month��. Be sure to follow all my decrees and regulations concerning this celebration." / ��This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late March, April, or early May
04Nm 9:4 So Moses told the people to celebrate the Passover
04Nm 9:5 in the wilderness of Sinai as twilight fell on the fourteenth day of the month. And they celebrated the festival there, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 9:6 But some of the men had been ceremonially defiled by touching a dead body, so they could not celebrate the Passover that day. They came to Moses and Aaron that day
04Nm 9:7 and said, "We have become ceremonially unclean by touching a dead body. But why should we be prevented from presenting the LORD's offering at the proper time with the rest of the Israelites?"
04Nm 9:8 Moses answered, "Wait here until I have received instructions for you from the LORD."
04Nm 9:9 This was the LORD's reply to Moses.
04Nm 9:10 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel�� If any of the people now or in future generations are ceremonially unclean at Passover time because of touching a dead body, or if they are on a journey and cannot be present at the ceremony, they may still celebrate the LORD's Passover.
04Nm 9:11 They must offer the Passover sacrifice one month later, at twilight on the fourteenth day of the second month��. They must eat the Passover lamb at that time with bitter salad greens and bread made without yeast. / ��This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late April, May, or early June
04Nm 9:12 They must not leave any of the lamb until the next morning, and they must not break any of its bones. They must follow all the normal regulations concerning the Passover.
04Nm 9:13 "But those who neglect to celebrate the Passover at the regular time, even though they are ceremonially clean and not away on a trip, will be cut off from the community of Israel. If they fail to present the LORD's offering at the proper time, they will suffer the consequences of their guilt.
04Nm 9:14 And if foreigners living among you want to celebrate the Passover to the LORD, they must follow these same decrees and regulations. The same laws apply both to native-born Israelites and to the foreigners living among you."
04Nm 9:15 On the day the Tabernacle was set up, the cloud covered it��. But from evening until morning the cloud over the Tabernacle looked like a pillar of fire. / ��Hebrew covered the Tabernacle, the Tent of the Testimony
04Nm 9:16 This was the regular pattern - at night the cloud that covered the Tabernacle had the appearance of fire.
04Nm 9:17 Whenever the cloud lifted from over the sacred tent, the people of Israel would break camp and follow it. And wherever the cloud settled, the people of Israel would set up camp.
04Nm 9:18 In this way, they traveled and camped at the LORD's command wherever he told them to go. Then they remained in their camp as long as the cloud stayed over the Tabernacle.
04Nm 9:19 If the cloud remained over the Tabernacle for a long time, the Israelites stayed and performed their duty to the LORD.
04Nm 9:20 Sometimes the cloud would stay over the Tabernacle for only a few days, so the people would stay for only a few days, as the LORD commanded. Then at the LORD's command they would break camp and move on.
04Nm 9:21 Sometimes the cloud stayed only overnight and lifted the next morning. But day or night, when the cloud lifted, the people broke camp and moved on.
04Nm 9:22 Whether the cloud stayed above the Tabernacle for two days, a month, or a year, the people of Israel stayed in camp and did not move on. But as soon as it lifted, they broke camp and moved on.
04Nm 9:23 So they camped or traveled at the LORD's command, and they did whatever the LORD told them through Moses.
04Nm 10:1 Now the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 10:2 "Make two trumpets of hammered silver for calling the community to assemble and for signaling the breaking of camp.
04Nm 10:3 When both trumpets are blown, everyone must gather before you at the entrance of the Tabernacle��. / ��Hebrew Tent of Meeting
04Nm 10:4 But if only one trumpet is blown, then only the leaders - the heads of the clans of Israel - must present themselves to you.
04Nm 10:5 "When you sound the signal to move on, the tribes camped on the east side of the Tabernacle must break camp and move forward.
04Nm 10:6 When you sound the signal a second time, the tribes camped on the south will follow. You must sound short blasts as the signal for moving on.
04Nm 10:7 But when you call the people to an assembly, blow the trumpets with a different signal.
04Nm 10:8 Only the priests, Aaron's descendants, are allowed to blow the trumpets. This is a permanent law for you, to be observed from generation to generation.
04Nm 10:9 "When you arrive in your own land and go to war against your enemies who attack you, sound the alarm with the trumpets. Then the LORD your God will remember you and rescue you from your enemies.
04Nm 10:10 Blow the trumpets in times of gladness, too, sounding them at your annual festivals and at the beginning of each month. And blow the trumpets over your burnt offerings and peace offerings. The trumpets will remind the LORD your God of his covenant with you. I am the LORD your God."
04Nm 10:11 In the second year after Israel's departure from Egypt - on the twentieth day of the second month�� - the cloud lifted from the Tabernacle of the Covenant��. / ��This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late April, May, or early June ��Or Tabernacle of the Testimony
04Nm 10:12 So the Israelites set out from the wilderness of Sinai and traveled on from place to place until the cloud stopped in the wilderness of Paran.
04Nm 10:13 When the people set out for the first time, following the instructions the LORD had given through Moses,
04Nm 10:14 Judah's troops led the way. They marched behind their banner, and their leader was Nahshon son of Amminadab.
04Nm 10:15 They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Issachar, led by Nethanel son of Zuar,
04Nm 10:16 and the troops of the tribe of Zebulun, led by Eliab son of Helon.
04Nm 10:17 Then the Tabernacle was taken down, and the Gershonite and Merarite divisions of the Levites were next in the line of march, carrying the Tabernacle with them.
04Nm 10:18 Reuben's troops went next, marching behind their banner. Their leader was Elizur son of Shedeur.
04Nm 10:19 They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Simeon, led by Shelumiel son of Zurishaddai,
04Nm 10:20 and the troops of the tribe of Gad, led by Eliasaph son of Deuel.
04Nm 10:21 Next came the Kohathite division of the Levites, carrying the sacred objects from the Tabernacle. Before they arrived at the next camp, the Tabernacle would already be set up at its new location.
04Nm 10:22 Ephraim's troops went next, marching behind their banner. Their leader was Elishama son of Ammihud.
04Nm 10:23 They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Manasseh, led by Gamaliel son of Pedahzur,
04Nm 10:24 and the troops of the tribe of Benjamin, led by Abidan son of Gideoni.
04Nm 10:25 Dan's troops went last, marching behind their banner and serving as the rear guard for all the tribal camps. Their leader was Ahiezer son of Ammishaddai.
04Nm 10:26 They were joined by the troops of the tribe of Asher, led by Pagiel son of Ocran,
04Nm 10:27 and the troops of the tribe of Naphtali, led by Ahira son of Enan.
04Nm 10:28 This was the order in which the Israelites marched, division by division.
04Nm 10:29 One day Moses said to his brother-in-law, Hobab son of Reuel the Midianite, "We are on our way to the place the LORD promised us, for he said, 'I will give it to you.' Come with us and we will treat you well, for the LORD has promised wonderful blessings for Israel!"
04Nm 10:30 But Hobab replied, "No, I will not go. I must return to my own land and family."
04Nm 10:31 "Please don't leave us," Moses pleaded. "You know the places in the wilderness where we should camp. Come, be our guide.
04Nm 10:32 If you do, we'll share with you all the blessings the LORD gives us."
04Nm 10:33 They marched for three days after leaving the mountain of the LORD, with the Ark of the LORD's Covenant moving ahead of them to show them where to stop and rest.
04Nm 10:34 As they moved on each day, the cloud of the LORD hovered over them.
04Nm 10:35 And whenever the Ark set out, Moses would shout, "Arise, O LORD, and let your enemies be scattered! Let them flee before you!"
04Nm 10:36 And when the Ark was set down, he would say, "Return, O LORD, to the countless thousands of Israel!"
04Nm 11:1 Soon the people began to complain about their hardship, and the LORD heard everything they said. Then the LORD's anger blazed against them, and he sent a fire to rage among them, and he destroyed some of the people in the outskirts of the camp.
04Nm 11:2 Then the people screamed to Moses for help, and when he prayed to the LORD, the fire stopped.
04Nm 11:3 After that, the area was known as Taberah (which means "the place of burning"), because fire from the LORD had burned among them there.
04Nm 11:4 Then the foreign rabble who were traveling with the Israelites began to crave the good things of Egypt. And the people of Israel also began to complain. "Oh, for some meat!" they exclaimed.
04Nm 11:5 "We remember the fish we used to eat for free in Egypt. And we had all the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic we wanted.
04Nm 11:6 But now our appetites are gone. All we ever see is this manna!"
04Nm 11:7 The manna looked like small coriander seeds, and it was pale yellow like gum resin.
04Nm 11:8 The people would go out and gather it from the ground. They made flour by grinding it with hand mills or pounding it in mortars. Then they boiled it in a pot and made it into flat cakes. These cakes tasted like pastries baked with olive oil.
04Nm 11:9 The manna came down on the camp with the dew during the night.
04Nm 11:10 Moses heard all the families standing in the doorways of their tents whining, and the LORD became extremely angry. Moses was also very aggravated.
04Nm 11:11 And Moses said to the LORD, "Why are you treating me, your servant, so harshly? Have mercy on me! What did I do to deserve the burden of all these people?
04Nm 11:12 Did I give birth to them? Did I bring them into the world? Why did you tell me to carry them in my arms like a mother carries a nursing baby? How can I carry them to the land you swore to give their ancestors?
04Nm 11:13 Where am I supposed to get meat for all these people? They keep whining to me, saying, 'Give us meat to eat!'
04Nm 11:14 I can't carry all these people by myself! The load is far too heavy!
04Nm 11:15 If this is how you intend to treat me, just go ahead and kill me. Do me a favor and spare me this misery!"
04Nm 11:16 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Gather before me seventy men who are recognized as elders and leaders of Israel. Bring them to the Tabernacle�� to stand there with you. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting
04Nm 11:17 I will come down and talk to you there. I will take some of the Spirit that is upon you, and I will put the Spirit upon them also. They will bear the burden of the people along with you, so you will not have to carry it alone.
04Nm 11:18 "And say to the people, 'Purify yourselves, for tomorrow you will have meat to eat. You were whining, and the LORD heard you when you cried, "Oh, for some meat! We were better off in Egypt!" Now the LORD will give you meat, and you will have to eat it.
04Nm 11:19 And it won't be for just a day or two, or for five or ten or even twenty.
04Nm 11:20 You will eat it for a whole month until you gag and are sick of it. For you have rejected the LORD, who is here among you, and you have whined to him, saying, "Why did we ever leave Egypt?"'"
04Nm 11:21 But Moses responded to the LORD, "There are 600,000 foot soldiers here with me, and yet you say, 'I will give them meat for a whole month!'
04Nm 11:22 Even if we butchered all our flocks and herds, would that satisfy them? Even if we caught all the fish in the sea, would that be enough?"
04Nm 11:23 Then the LORD said to Moses, "Has my arm lost its power? Now you will see whether or not my word comes true!"
04Nm 11:24 So Moses went out and reported the LORD's words to the people. He gathered the seventy elders and stationed them around the Tabernacle��. / ��Hebrew the tent; also in 11.26
04Nm 11:25 And the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to Moses. Then he gave the seventy elders the same Spirit that was upon Moses. And when the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied. But this never happened again.
04Nm 11:26 Two men, Eldad and Medad, had stayed behind in the camp. They were listed among the elders, but they had not gone out to the Tabernacle. Yet the Spirit rested upon them as well, so they prophesied there in the camp.
04Nm 11:27 A young man ran and reported to Moses, "Eldad and Medad are prophesying in the camp!"
04Nm 11:28 Joshua son of Nun, who had been Moses' assistant since his youth, protested, "Moses, my master, make them stop!"
04Nm 11:29 But Moses replied, "Are you jealous for my sake? I wish that all the LORD's people were prophets and that the LORD would put his Spirit upon them all!"
04Nm 11:30 Then Moses returned to the camp with the elders of Israel.
04Nm 11:31 Now the LORD sent a wind that brought quail from the sea and let them fall all around the camp. For miles in every direction there were quail flying about three feet above the ground��. / ��Or there were quail 3 feet [2 cubits or 92 centimeters] deep on the ground
04Nm 11:32 So the people went out and caught quail all that day and throughout the night and all the next day, too. No one gathered less than fifty bushels��! They spread the quail all around the camp to dry. / ��Hebrew 10 homers [1.8 kiloliters]
04Nm 11:33 But while they were gorging themselves on the meat - while it was still in their mouths - the anger of the LORD blazed against the people, and he struck them with a severe plague.
04Nm 11:34 So that place was called Kibroth-hattaavah (which means "graves of gluttony") because there they buried the people who had craved meat from Egypt.
04Nm 11:35 From Kibroth-hattaavah the Israelites traveled to Hazeroth, where they stayed for some time.
04Nm 12:1 While they were at Hazeroth, Miriam and Aaron criticized Moses because he had married a Cushite woman.
04Nm 12:2 They said, "Has the LORD spoken only through Moses? Hasn't he spoken through us, too?" But the LORD heard them.
04Nm 12:3 (Now Moses was very humble - more humble than any other person on earth.)
04Nm 12:4 So immediately the LORD called to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam and said, "Go out to the Tabernacle��, all three of you!" So the three of them went to the Tabernacle. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting
04Nm 12:5 Then the LORD descended in the pillar of cloud and stood at the entrance of the Tabernacle��. "Aaron and Miriam!" he called, and they stepped forward. / ��Hebrew the tent; also in 12.10
04Nm 12:6 And the LORD said to them, "Now listen to what I say�� "If there were prophets among you, I, the LORD, would reveal myself in visions.I would speak to them in dreams.
04Nm 12:7 But not with my servant Moses.Of all my house, he is the one I trust.
04Nm 12:8 I speak to him face to face, clearly, and not in riddles! He sees the LORD as he is. So why were you not afraid to criticize my servant Moses?"
04Nm 12:9 The LORD was very angry with them, and he departed.
04Nm 12:10 As the cloud moved from above the Tabernacle, there stood Miriam, her skin as white as snow from leprosy��. When Aaron saw what had happened to her, / ��Or with a skin disease. The Hebrew word used here can describe various skin diseases
04Nm 12:11 he cried out to Moses, "Oh, my master! Please don't punish us for this sin we have so foolishly committed.
04Nm 12:12 Don't let her be like a stillborn baby, already decayed at birth."
04Nm 12:13 So Moses cried out to the LORD, "O God, I beg you, please heal her!"
04Nm 12:14 But the LORD said to Moses, "If her father had done nothing more than spit in her face, wouldn't she be defiled for seven days? So keep her outside the camp for seven days, and after that she may be accepted back."
04Nm 12:15 So Miriam was kept outside the camp for seven days, and the people waited until she was brought back before they traveled again.
04Nm 12:16 Then they left Hazeroth and camped in the wilderness of Paran.
04Nm 13:1 The LORD now said to Moses,
04Nm 13:2 "Send out men to explore the land of Canaan, the land I am giving to the Israelites. Send one leader from each of the twelve ancestral tribes."
04Nm 13:3 So Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He sent out twelve men, all tribal leaders of Israel, from their camp in the wilderness of Paran.
04Nm 13:4 These were the tribes and the names of their leaders�� Reuben Shammua son of Zaccur 
04Nm 13:5 Simeon Shaphat son of Hori 
04Nm 13:6 Judah Caleb son of Jephunneh 
04Nm 13:7 Issachar Igal son of Joseph 
04Nm 13:8 Ephraim Hoshea son of Nun 
04Nm 13:9 Benjamin Palti son of Raphu 
04Nm 13:10 Zebulun Gaddiel son of Sodi 
04Nm 13:11 Manasseh son of Joseph Gaddi son of Susi 
04Nm 13:12 Dan Ammiel son of Gemalli 
04Nm 13:13 Asher Sethur son of Michael 
04Nm 13:14 Naphtali Nahbi son of Vophsi 
04Nm 13:15 Gad Geuel son of Maki 
04Nm 13:16 These are the names of the men Moses sent out to explore the land. (Moses called Hoshea son of Nun by the name Joshua.)
04Nm 13:17 Moses gave the men these instructions as he sent them out to explore the land�� "Go north through the Negev into the hill country.
04Nm 13:18 See what the land is like, and find out whether the people living there are strong or weak, few or many.
04Nm 13:19 See what kind of land they live in. Is it good or bad? Do their towns have walls, or are they unprotected like open camps?
04Nm 13:20 Is the soil fertile or poor? Are there many trees? Do your best to bring back samples of the crops you see." (It happened to be the season for harvesting the first ripe grapes.)
04Nm 13:21 So they went up and explored the land from the wilderness of Zin as far as Rehob, near Lebo-hamath.
04Nm 13:22 Going north, they passed through the Negev and arrived at Hebron, where Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai - all descendants of Anak - lived. (The ancient town of Hebron was founded seven years before the Egyptian city of Zoan.)
04Nm 13:23 When they came to the valley of Eshcol, they cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes so large that it took two of them to carry it on a pole between them! They also brought back samples of the pomegranates and figs.
04Nm 13:24 That place was called the valley of Eshcol (which means "cluster"), because of the cluster of grapes the Israelite men cut there.
04Nm 13:25 After exploring the land for forty days, the men returned
04Nm 13:26 to Moses, Aaron, and the whole community of Israel at Kadesh in the wilderness of Paran. They reported to the whole community what they had seen and showed them the fruit they had taken from the land.
04Nm 13:27 This was their report to Moses�� "We entered the land you sent us to explore, and it is indeed a bountiful country - a land flowing with milk and honey. Here is the kind of fruit it produces.
04Nm 13:28 But the people living there are powerful, and their towns are large and fortified. We even saw giants there, the descendants of Anak!
04Nm 13:29 The Amalekites live in the Negev, and the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country. The Canaanites live along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea�� and along the Jordan Valley." / ��Hebrew the sea
04Nm 13:30 But Caleb tried to quiet the people as they stood before Moses. "Let's go at once to take the land," he said. "We can certainly conquer it!"
04Nm 13:31 But the other men who had explored the land with him disagreed. "We can't go up against them! They are stronger than we are!"
04Nm 13:32 So they spread this bad report about the land among the Israelites�� "The land we traveled through and explored will devour anyone who goes to live there. All the people we saw were huge.
04Nm 13:33 We even saw giants�� there, the descendants of Anak. Next to them we felt like grasshoppers, and that's what they thought, too!" / ��Hebrew nephilim
04Nm 14:1 Then the whole community began weeping aloud, and they cried all night.
04Nm 14:2 Their voices rose in a great chorus of protest against Moses and Aaron. "If only we had died in Egypt, or even here in the wilderness!" they complained.
04Nm 14:3 "Why is the LORD taking us to this country only to have us die in battle? Our wives and our little ones will be carried off as plunder! Wouldn't it be better for us to return to Egypt?"
04Nm 14:4 Then they plotted among themselves, "Let's choose a new leader and go back to Egypt!"
04Nm 14:5 Then Moses and Aaron fell face down on the ground before the whole community of Israel.
04Nm 14:6 Two of the men who had explored the land, Joshua son of Nun and Caleb son of Jephunneh, tore their clothing.
04Nm 14:7 They said to all the people of Israel, "The land we traveled through and explored is a wonderful land!
04Nm 14:8 And if the LORD is pleased with us, he will bring us safely into that land and give it to us. It is a rich land flowing with milk and honey.
04Nm 14:9 Do not rebel against the LORD, and don't be afraid of the people of the land. They are only helpless prey to us! They have no protection, but the LORD is with us! Don't be afraid of them!"
04Nm 14:10 But the whole community began to talk about stoning Joshua and Caleb. Then the glorious presence of the LORD appeared to all the Israelites at the Tabernacle��. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting
04Nm 14:11 And the LORD said to Moses, "How long will these people treat me with contempt? Will they never believe me, even after all the miraculous signs I have done among them?
04Nm 14:12 I will disown them and destroy them with a plague. Then I will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they are!"
04Nm 14:13 But Moses objected. "What will the Egyptians think when they hear about it?" he asked the LORD. "They know full well the power you displayed in rescuing your people from Egypt.
04Nm 14:14 Now if you destroy them, the Egyptians will send a report to the inhabitants of this land, who have already heard that you live among your people. They know, LORD, that you have appeared to your people face to face and that your pillar of cloud hovers over them. They know that you go before them in the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night.
04Nm 14:15 Now if you slaughter all these people with a single blow, the nations that have heard of your fame will say,
04Nm 14:16 'The LORD was not able to bring them into the land he swore to give them, so he killed them in the wilderness.'
04Nm 14:17 "Please, Lord, prove that your power is as great as you have claimed. For you said,
04Nm 14:18 'The LORD is slow to anger and filled with unfailing love, forgiving every kind of sin and rebellion. But he does not excuse the guilty. He lays the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected - even children in the third and fourth generations.'
04Nm 14:19 In keeping with your magnificent, unfailing love, please pardon the sins of this people, just as you have forgiven them ever since they left Egypt."
04Nm 14:20 Then the LORD said, "I will pardon them as you have requested.
04Nm 14:21 But as surely as I live, and as surely as the earth is filled with the LORD's glory,
04Nm 14:22 not one of these people will ever enter that land. They have all seen my glorious presence and the miraculous signs I performed both in Egypt and in the wilderness, but again and again they have tested me by refusing to listen to my voice.
04Nm 14:23 They will never even see the land I swore to give their ancestors. None of those who have treated me with contempt will ever see it.
04Nm 14:24 But my servant Caleb has a different attitude than the others have. He has remained loyal to me, so I will bring him into the land he explored. His descendants will possess their full share of that land.
04Nm 14:25 Now turn around, and don't go on toward the land where the Amalekites and Canaanites live. Tomorrow you must set out for the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea��." / ��Hebrew sea of reeds
04Nm 14:26 Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
04Nm 14:27 "How long must I put up with this wicked community and its complaints about me? Yes, I have heard the complaints the Israelites are making against me.
04Nm 14:28 Now tell them this�� 'As surely as I live, declares the LORD, I will do to you the very things I heard you say.
04Nm 14:29 You will all drop dead in this wilderness! Because you complained against me, every one of you who is twenty years old or older and was included in the registration will die.
04Nm 14:30 You will not enter and occupy the land I swore to give you. The only exceptions will be Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
04Nm 14:31 "'You said your children would be carried off as plunder. Well, I will bring them safely into the land, and they will enjoy what you have despised.
04Nm 14:32 But as for you, you will drop dead in this wilderness.
04Nm 14:33 And your children will be like shepherds, wandering in the wilderness for forty years. In this way, they will pay for your faithlessness, until the last of you lies dead in the wilderness.
04Nm 14:34 "'Because your men explored the land for forty days, you must wander in the wilderness for forty years - a year for each day, suffering the consequences of your sins. Then you will discover what it is like to have me for an enemy.'
04Nm 14:35 I, the LORD, have spoken! I will certainly do these things to every member of the community who has conspired against me. They will be destroyed here in this wilderness, and here they will die!"
04Nm 14:36 The ten men Moses had sent to explore the land - the ones who incited rebellion against the LORD with their bad report - 
04Nm 14:37 were struck dead with a plague before the LORD.
04Nm 14:38 Of the twelve who had explored the land, only Joshua and Caleb remained alive.
04Nm 14:39 When Moses reported the LORD's words to all the Israelites, the people were filled with grief.
04Nm 14:40 Then they got up early the next morning and went to the top of the range of hills. "Let's go," they said. "We realize that we have sinned, but now we are ready to enter the land the LORD has promised us."
04Nm 14:41 But Moses said, "Why are you now disobeying the LORD's orders to return to the wilderness? It won't work.
04Nm 14:42 Do not go up into the land now. You will only be crushed by your enemies because the LORD is not with you.
04Nm 14:43 When you face the Amalekites and Canaanites in battle, you will be slaughtered. The LORD will abandon you because you have abandoned the LORD."
04Nm 14:44 But the people defiantly pushed ahead toward the hill country, even though neither Moses nor the Ark of the LORD's Covenant left the camp.
04Nm 14:45 Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in those hills came down and attacked them and chased them back as far as Hormah.
04Nm 15:1 Then the LORD told Moses,
04Nm 15:2 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel."When you finally settle in the land I am giving you,
04Nm 15:3 you will offer special gifts as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. These gifts may take the form of a burnt offering, a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, a voluntary offering, or an offering at any of your annual festivals, and they may be taken from your herds of cattle or your flocks of sheep and goats.
04Nm 15:4 When you present these offerings, you must also give the LORD a grain offering of two quarts�� of choice flour mixed with one quart�� of olive oil. / ��Hebrew 1/10 of an ephah [2.2 liters] ��Hebrew 1/4 of a hin [1 liter]; also in 15.5
04Nm 15:5 For each lamb offered as a burnt offering or a special sacrifice, you must also present one quart of wine as a liquid offering.
04Nm 15:6 "If the sacrifice is a ram, give a grain offering of four quarts�� of choice flour mixed with a third of a gallon�� of olive oil, / ��Hebrew 2/10 of an ephah [4.4 liters] ��Hebrew 1/3 of a hin [1.3 liters]; also in 15.7
04Nm 15:7 and give a third of a gallon of wine as a liquid offering. This will be a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 15:8 "When you present a young bull as a burnt offering or as a sacrifice to fulfill a vow or as a peace offering to the LORD,
04Nm 15:9 you must also give a grain offering of six quarts�� of choice flour mixed with two quarts�� of olive oil, / ��Hebrew 3/10 of an ephah [6.6 liters] ��Hebrew 1/2 of a hin [2 liters]; also in 15.10
04Nm 15:10 and give two quarts of wine as a liquid offering. This will be a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 15:11 "Each sacrifice of a bull, ram, lamb, or young goat should be prepared in this way.
04Nm 15:12 Follow these instructions with each offering you present.
04Nm 15:13 All of you native-born Israelites must follow these instructions when you offer a special gift as a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 15:14 And if any foreigners visit you or live among you and want to present a special gift as a pleasing aroma to the LORD, they must follow these same procedures.
04Nm 15:15 Native-born Israelites and foreigners are equal before the LORD and are subject to the same decrees. This is a permanent law for you, to be observed from generation to generation.
04Nm 15:16 The same instructions and regulations will apply both to you and to the foreigners living among you."
04Nm 15:17 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 15:18 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel."When you arrive in the land where I am taking you,
04Nm 15:19 and you eat the crops that grow there, you must set some aside as a sacred offering to the LORD.
04Nm 15:20 Present a cake from the first of the flour you grind, and set it aside as a sacred offering, as you do with the first grain from the threshing floor.
04Nm 15:21 Throughout the generations to come, you are to present a sacred offering to the LORD each year from the first of your ground flour.
04Nm 15:22 "But suppose you unintentionally fail to carry out all these commands that the LORD has given you through Moses.
04Nm 15:23 And suppose your descendants in the future fail to do everything the LORD has commanded through Moses.
04Nm 15:24 If the mistake was made unintentionally, and the community was unaware of it, the whole community must present a young bull for a burnt offering as a pleasing aroma to the LORD. It must be offered along with its prescribed grain offering and liquid offering and with one male goat for a sin offering.
04Nm 15:25 With it the priest will purify the whole community of Israel, making them right with the LORD��, and they will be forgiven. For it was an unintentional sin, and they have corrected it with their offerings to the LORD - the special gift and the sin offering. / ��Or will make atonement for the whole community of Israel
04Nm 15:26 The whole community of Israel will be forgiven, including the foreigners living among you, for all the people were involved in the sin.
04Nm 15:27 "If one individual commits an unintentional sin, the guilty person must bring a one-year-old female goat for a sin offering.
04Nm 15:28 The priest will sacrifice it to purify�� the guilty person before the LORD, and that person will be forgiven. / ��Or to make atonement for
04Nm 15:29 These same instructions apply both to native-born Israelites and to the foreigners living among you.
04Nm 15:30 "But those who brazenly violate the LORD's will, whether native-born Israelites or foreigners, have blasphemed the LORD, and they must be cut off from the community.
04Nm 15:31 Since they have treated the LORD's word with contempt and deliberately disobeyed his command, they must be completely cut off and suffer the punishment for their guilt."
04Nm 15:32 One day while the people of Israel were in the wilderness, they discovered a man gathering wood on the Sabbath day.
04Nm 15:33 The people who found him doing this took him before Moses, Aaron, and the rest of the community.
04Nm 15:34 They held him in custody because they did not know what to do with him.
04Nm 15:35 Then the LORD said to Moses, "The man must be put to death! The whole community must stone him outside the camp."
04Nm 15:36 So the whole community took the man outside the camp and stoned him to death, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 15:37 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 15:38 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel�� Throughout the generations to come you must make tassels for the hems of your clothing and attach them with a blue cord.
04Nm 15:39 When you see the tassels, you will remember and obey all the commands of the LORD instead of following your own desires and defiling yourselves, as you are prone to do.
04Nm 15:40 The tassels will help you remember that you must obey all my commands and be holy to your God.
04Nm 15:41 I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt that I might be your God. I am the LORD your God!"
04Nm 16:1 One day Korah son of Izhar, a descendant of Kohath son of Levi, conspired with Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On son of Peleth, from the tribe of Reuben.
04Nm 16:2 They incited a rebellion against Moses, along with 250 other leaders of the community, all prominent members of the assembly.
04Nm 16:3 They united against Moses and Aaron and said, "You have gone too far! The whole community of Israel has been set apart by the LORD, and he is with all of us. What right do you have to act as though you are greater than the rest of the LORD's people?"
04Nm 16:4 When Moses heard what they were saying, he fell face down on the ground.
04Nm 16:5 Then he said to Korah and his followers, "Tomorrow morning the LORD will show us who belongs to him�� and who is holy. The LORD will allow only those whom he selects to enter his own presence. / ��Greek version reads God has visited and knows those who are his. Compare 2 Tim 2.19
04Nm 16:6 Korah, you and all your followers must prepare your incense burners.
04Nm 16:7 Light fires in them tomorrow, and burn incense before the LORD. Then we will see whom the LORD chooses as his holy one. You Levites are the ones who have gone too far!"
04Nm 16:8 Then Moses spoke again to Korah�� "Now listen, you Levites!
04Nm 16:9 Does it seem insignificant to you that the God of Israel has chosen you from among all the community of Israel to be near him so you can serve in the LORD's Tabernacle and stand before the people to minister to them?
04Nm 16:10 Korah, he has already given this special ministry to you and your fellow Levites. Are you now demanding the priesthood as well?
04Nm 16:11 The LORD is the one you and your followers are really revolting against! For who is Aaron that you are complaining about him?"
04Nm 16:12 Then Moses summoned Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, but they replied, "We refuse to come before you!
04Nm 16:13 Isn't it enough that you brought us out of Egypt, a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us here in this wilderness, and that you now treat us like your subjects?
04Nm 16:14 What's more, you haven't brought us into another land flowing with milk and honey. You haven't given us a new homeland with fields and vineyards. Are you trying to fool these men?�� We will not come." / ��Hebrew Are you trying to put out the eyes of these men?
04Nm 16:15 Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, "Do not accept their grain offerings! I have not taken so much as a donkey from them, and I have never hurt a single one of them."
04Nm 16:16 And Moses said to Korah, "You and all your followers must come here tomorrow and present yourselves before the LORD. Aaron will also be here.
04Nm 16:17 You and each of your 250 followers must prepare an incense burner and put incense on it, so you can all present them before the LORD. Aaron will also bring his incense burner."
04Nm 16:18 So each of these men prepared an incense burner, lit the fire, and placed incense on it. Then they all stood at the entrance of the Tabernacle�� with Moses and Aaron. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting; also in 16.19, 42, 43, 50
04Nm 16:19 Meanwhile, Korah had stirred up the entire community against Moses and Aaron, and they all gathered at the Tabernacle entrance. Then the glorious presence of the LORD appeared to the whole community,
04Nm 16:20 and the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
04Nm 16:21 "Get away from all these people so that I may instantly destroy them!"
04Nm 16:22 But Moses and Aaron fell face down on the ground. "O God," they pleaded, "you are the God who gives breath to all creatures. Must you be angry with all the people when only one man sins?"
04Nm 16:23 And the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 16:24 "Then tell all the people to get away from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram."
04Nm 16:25 So Moses got up and rushed over to the tents of Dathan and Abiram, followed by the elders of Israel.
04Nm 16:26 "Quick!" he told the people. "Get away from the tents of these wicked men, and don't touch anything that belongs to them. If you do, you will be destroyed for their sins."
04Nm 16:27 So all the people stood back from the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram. Then Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the entrances of their tents, together with their wives and children and little ones.
04Nm 16:28 And Moses said, "This is how you will know that the LORD has sent me to do all these things that I have done - for I have not done them on my own.
04Nm 16:29 If these men die a natural death, or if nothing unusual happens, then the LORD has not sent me.
04Nm 16:30 But if the LORD does something entirely new and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them and all their belongings, and they go down alive into the grave��, then you will know that these men have shown contempt for the LORD." / ��Hebrew into Sheol; also in 16.33
04Nm 16:31 He had hardly finished speaking the words when the ground suddenly split open beneath them.
04Nm 16:32 The earth opened its mouth and swallowed the men, along with their households and all their followers who were standing with them, and everything they owned.
04Nm 16:33 So they went down alive into the grave, along with all their belongings. The earth closed over them, and they all vanished from among the people of Israel.
04Nm 16:34 All the people around them fled when they heard their screams. "The earth will swallow us, too!" they cried.
04Nm 16:35 Then fire blazed forth from the LORD and burned up the 250 men who were offering incense.
04Nm 16:36 ��And the LORD said to Moses, / ��Verses 16.36-50 are numbered 17.1-15 in Hebrew text
04Nm 16:37 "Tell Eleazar son of Aaron the priest to pull all the incense burners from the fire, for they are holy. Also tell him to scatter the burning coals.
04Nm 16:38 Take the incense burners of these men who have sinned at the cost of their lives, and hammer the metal into a thin sheet to overlay the altar. Since these burners were used in the LORD's presence, they have become holy. Let them serve as a warning to the people of Israel."
04Nm 16:39 So Eleazar the priest collected the 250 bronze incense burners that had been used by the men who died in the fire, and he hammered them into a thin sheet to overlay the altar.
04Nm 16:40 This would warn the Israelites that no unauthorized person - no one who was not a descendant of Aaron - should ever enter the LORD's presence to burn incense. If anyone did, the same thing would happen to him as happened to Korah and his followers. So the LORD's instructions to Moses were carried out.
04Nm 16:41 But the very next morning the whole community of Israel began muttering again against Moses and Aaron, saying, "You have killed the LORD's people!"
04Nm 16:42 As the community gathered to protest against Moses and Aaron, they turned toward the Tabernacle and saw that the cloud had covered it, and the glorious presence of the LORD appeared.
04Nm 16:43 Moses and Aaron came and stood in front of the Tabernacle,
04Nm 16:44 and the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 16:45 "Get away from all these people so that I can instantly destroy them!" But Moses and Aaron fell face down on the ground.
04Nm 16:46 And Moses said to Aaron, "Quick, take an incense burner and place burning coals on it from the altar. Lay incense on it, and carry it out among the people to purify them and make them right with the LORD��. The LORD's anger is blazing against them - the plague has already begun." / ��Or to make atonement for them
04Nm 16:47 Aaron did as Moses told him and ran out among the people. The plague had already begun to strike down the people, but Aaron burned the incense and purified�� the people. / ��Or and made atonement for
04Nm 16:48 He stood between the dead and the living, and the plague stopped.
04Nm 16:49 But 14,700 people died in that plague, in addition to those who had died in the affair involving Korah.
04Nm 16:50 Then because the plague had stopped, Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the Tabernacle.
04Nm 17:1 ��Then the LORD said to Moses, / ��Verses 17.1-13 are numbered 17.16-28 in Hebrew text
04Nm 17:2 "Tell the people of Israel to bring you twelve wooden staffs, one from each leader of Israel's ancestral tribes, and inscribe each leader's name on his staff.
04Nm 17:3 Inscribe Aaron's name on the staff of the tribe of Levi, for there must be one staff for the leader of each ancestral tribe.
04Nm 17:4 Place these staffs in the Tabernacle in front of the Ark containing the tablets of the Covenant��, where I meet with you. / ��Hebrew in the Tent of Meeting before the Testimony. The Hebrew word for "testimony" refers to the terms of the LORD's covenant with Israel as written on stone tablets, which were kept in the Ark, and also to the covenant itself
04Nm 17:5 Buds will sprout on the staff belonging to the man I choose. Then I will finally put an end to the people's murmuring and complaining against you."
04Nm 17:6 So Moses gave the instructions to the people of Israel, and each of the twelve tribal leaders, including Aaron, brought Moses a staff.
04Nm 17:7 Moses placed the staffs in the LORD's presence in the Tabernacle of the Covenant��. / ��Or Tabernacle of the Testimony; also in 17.8
04Nm 17:8 When he went into the Tabernacle of the Covenant the next day, he found that Aaron's staff, representing the tribe of Levi, had sprouted, budded, blossomed, and produced ripe almonds!
04Nm 17:9 When Moses brought all the staffs out from the LORD's presence, he showed them to the people. Each man claimed his own staff.
04Nm 17:10 And the LORD said to Moses�� "Place Aaron's staff permanently before the Ark of the Covenant�� to serve as a warning to rebels. This should put an end to their complaints against me and prevent any further deaths." / ��Hebrew before the Testimony; see note on 17.4
04Nm 17:11 So Moses did as the LORD commanded him.
04Nm 17:12 Then the people of Israel said to Moses, "Look, we are doomed! We are dead! We are ruined!
04Nm 17:13 Everyone who even comes close to the Tabernacle of the LORD dies. Are we all doomed to die?"
04Nm 18:1 Then the LORD said to Aaron�� "You, your sons, and your relatives from the tribe of Levi will be held responsible for any offenses related to the sanctuary. But you and your sons alone will be held responsible for violations connected with the priesthood.
04Nm 18:2 "Bring your relatives of the tribe of Levi - your ancestral tribe - to assist you and your sons as you perform the sacred duties in front of the Tabernacle of the Covenant��. / ��Or Tabernacle of the Testimony
04Nm 18:3 But as the Levites go about all their assigned duties at the Tabernacle, they must be careful not to go near any of the sacred objects or the altar. If they do, both you and they will die.
04Nm 18:4 The Levites must join you in fulfilling their responsibilities for the care and maintenance of the Tabernacle��, but no unauthorized person may assist you. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting; also in 18.6, 21, 22, 23, 31
04Nm 18:5 "You yourselves must perform the sacred duties inside the sanctuary and at the altar. If you follow these instructions, the LORD's anger will never again blaze against the people of Israel.
04Nm 18:6 I myself have chosen your fellow Levites from among the Israelites to be your special assistants. They are a gift to you, dedicated to the LORD for service in the Tabernacle.
04Nm 18:7 But you and your sons, the priests, must personally handle all the priestly rituals associated with the altar and with everything behind the inner curtain. I am giving you the priesthood as your special privilege of service. Any unauthorized person who comes too near the sanctuary will be put to death."
04Nm 18:8 The LORD gave these further instructions to Aaron�� "I myself have put you in charge of all the holy offerings that are brought to me by the people of Israel. I have given all these consecrated offerings to you and your sons as your permanent share.
04Nm 18:9 You are allotted the portion of the most holy offerings that is not burned on the fire. This portion of all the most holy offerings - including the grain offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings - will be most holy, and it belongs to you and your sons.
04Nm 18:10 You must eat it as a most holy offering. All the males may eat of it, and you must treat it as most holy.
04Nm 18:11 "All the sacred offerings and special offerings presented to me when the Israelites lift them up before the altar also belong to you. I have given them to you and to your sons and daughters as your permanent share. Any member of your family who is ceremonially clean may eat of these offerings.
04Nm 18:12 "I also give you the harvest gifts brought by the people as offerings to the LORD - the best of the olive oil, new wine, and grain.
04Nm 18:13 All the first crops of their land that the people present to the LORD belong to you. Any member of your family who is ceremonially clean may eat this food.
04Nm 18:14 "Everything in Israel that is specially set apart for the LORD�� also belongs to you. / ��The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering
04Nm 18:15 "The firstborn of every mother, whether human or animal, that is offered to the LORD will be yours. But you must always redeem your firstborn sons and the firstborn of ceremonially unclean animals.
04Nm 18:16 Redeem them when they are one month old. The redemption price is five pieces of silver�� (as measured by the weight of the sanctuary shekel, which equals twenty gerahs). / ��Hebrew 5 shekels [2 ounces or 57 grams] of silver
04Nm 18:17 "However, you may not redeem the firstborn of cattle, sheep, or goats. They are holy and have been set apart for the LORD. Sprinkle their blood on the altar, and burn their fat as a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the LORD.
04Nm 18:18 The meat of these animals will be yours, just like the breast and right thigh that are presented by lifting them up as a special offering before the altar.
04Nm 18:19 Yes, I am giving you all these holy offerings that the people of Israel bring to the LORD. They are for you and your sons and daughters, to be eaten as your permanent share. This is an eternal and unbreakable covenant�� between the LORD and you, and it also applies to your descendants." / ��Hebrew a covenant of salt
04Nm 18:20 And the LORD said to Aaron, "You priests will receive no allotment of land or share of property among the people of Israel. I am your share and your allotment.
04Nm 18:21 As for the tribe of Levi, your relatives, I will compensate them for their service in the Tabernacle. Instead of an allotment of land, I will give them the tithes from the entire land of Israel.
04Nm 18:22 "From now on, no Israelites except priests or Levites may approach the Tabernacle. If they come too near, they will be judged guilty and will die.
04Nm 18:23 Only the Levites may serve at the Tabernacle, and they will be held responsible for any offenses against it. This is a permanent law for you, to be observed from generation to generation. The Levites will receive no allotment of land among the Israelites,
04Nm 18:24 because I have given them the Israelites' tithes, which have been presented as sacred offerings to the LORD. This will be the Levites' share. That is why I said they would receive no allotment of land among the Israelites."
04Nm 18:25 The LORD also told Moses,
04Nm 18:26 "Give these instructions to the Levites�� When you receive from the people of Israel the tithes I have assigned as your allotment, give a tenth of the tithes you receive - a tithe of the tithe - to the LORD as a sacred offering.
04Nm 18:27 The LORD will consider this offering to be your harvest offering, as though it were the first grain from your own threshing floor or wine from your own winepress.
04Nm 18:28 You must present one-tenth of the tithe received from the Israelites as a sacred offering to the LORD. This is the LORD's sacred portion, and you must present it to Aaron the priest.
04Nm 18:29 Be sure to give to the LORD the best portions of the gifts given to you.
04Nm 18:30 "Also, give these instructions to the Levites�� When you present the best part as your offering, it will be considered as though it came from your own threshing floor or winepress.
04Nm 18:31 You Levites and your families may eat this food anywhere you wish, for it is your compensation for serving in the Tabernacle.
04Nm 18:32 You will not be considered guilty for accepting the LORD's tithes if you give the best portion to the priests. But be careful not to treat the holy gifts of the people of Israel as though they were common. If you do, you will die."
04Nm 19:1 The LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
04Nm 19:2 "Here is another legal requirement commanded by the LORD�� Tell the people of Israel to bring you a red heifer, a perfect animal that has no defects and has never been yoked to a plow.
04Nm 19:3 Give it to Eleazar the priest, and it will be taken outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.
04Nm 19:4 Eleazar will take some of its blood on his finger and sprinkle it seven times toward the front of the Tabernacle��. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting
04Nm 19:5 As Eleazar watches, the heifer must be burned - its hide, meat, blood, and dung.
04Nm 19:6 Eleazar the priest must then take a stick of cedar��, a hyssop branch, and some scarlet yarn and throw them into the fire where the heifer is burning. / ��Or juniper
04Nm 19:7 "Then the priest must wash his clothes and bathe himself in water. Afterward he may return to the camp, though he will remain ceremonially unclean until evening.
04Nm 19:8 The man who burns the animal must also wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and he, too, will remain unclean until evening.
04Nm 19:9 Then someone who is ceremonially clean will gather up the ashes of the heifer and deposit them in a purified place outside the camp. They will be kept there for the community of Israel to use in the water for the purification ceremony. This ceremony is performed for the removal of sin.
04Nm 19:10 The man who gathers up the ashes of the heifer must also wash his clothes, and he will remain ceremonially unclean until evening. This is a permanent law for the people of Israel and any foreigners who live among them.
04Nm 19:11 "All those who touch a dead human body will be ceremonially unclean for seven days.
04Nm 19:12 They must purify themselves on the third and seventh days with the water of purification; then they will be purified. But if they do not do this on the third and seventh days, they will continue to be unclean even after the seventh day.
04Nm 19:13 All those who touch a dead body and do not purify themselves in the proper way defile the LORD's Tabernacle, and they will be cut off from the community of Israel. Since the water of purification was not sprinkled on them, their defilement continues.
04Nm 19:14 "This is the ritual law that applies when someone dies inside a tent�� All those who enter that tent and those who were inside when the death occurred will be ceremonially unclean for seven days.
04Nm 19:15 Any open container in the tent that was not covered with a lid is also defiled.
04Nm 19:16 And if someone in an open field touches the corpse of someone who was killed with a sword or who died a natural death, or if someone touches a human bone or a grave, that person will be defiled for seven days.
04Nm 19:17 "To remove the defilement, put some of the ashes from the burnt purification offering in a jar, and pour fresh water over them.
04Nm 19:18 Then someone who is ceremonially clean must take a hyssop branch and dip it into the water. That person must sprinkle the water on the tent, on all the furnishings in the tent, and on the people who were in the tent; also on the person who touched a human bone, or touched someone who was killed or who died naturally, or touched a grave.
04Nm 19:19 On the third and seventh days the person who is ceremonially clean must sprinkle the water on those who are defiled. Then on the seventh day the people being cleansed must wash their clothes and bathe themselves, and that evening they will be cleansed of their defilement.
04Nm 19:20 "But those who become defiled and do not purify themselves will be cut off from the community, for they have defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. Since the water of purification has not been sprinkled on them, they remain defiled.
04Nm 19:21 This is a permanent law for the people. Those who sprinkle the water of purification must afterward wash their clothes, and anyone who then touches the water used for purification will remain defiled until evening.
04Nm 19:22 Anything and anyone that a defiled person touches will be ceremonially unclean until evening."
04Nm 20:1 In the first month of the year��, the whole community of Israel arrived in the wilderness of Zin and camped at Kadesh. While they were there, Miriam died and was buried. / ��The first month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of March and April. The number of years since leaving Egypt is not specified
04Nm 20:2 There was no water for the people to drink at that place, so they rebelled against Moses and Aaron.
04Nm 20:3 The people blamed Moses and said, "If only we had died in the LORD's presence with our brothers!
04Nm 20:4 Why have you brought the congregation of the LORD's people into this wilderness to die, along with all our livestock?
04Nm 20:5 Why did you make us leave Egypt and bring us here to this terrible place? This land has no grain, no figs, no grapes, no pomegranates, and no water to drink!"
04Nm 20:6 Moses and Aaron turned away from the people and went to the entrance of the Tabernacle��, where they fell face down on the ground. Then the glorious presence of the LORD appeared to them, / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting
04Nm 20:7 and the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 20:8 "You and Aaron must take the staff and assemble the entire community. As the people watch, speak to the rock over there, and it will pour out its water. You will provide enough water from the rock to satisfy the whole community and their livestock."
04Nm 20:9 So Moses did as he was told. He took the staff from the place where it was kept before the LORD.
04Nm 20:10 Then he and Aaron summoned the people to come and gather at the rock. "Listen, you rebels!" he shouted. "Must we bring you water from this rock?"
04Nm 20:11 Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with the staff, and water gushed out. So the entire community and their livestock drank their fill.
04Nm 20:12 But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, "Because you did not trust me enough to demonstrate my holiness to the people of Israel, you will not lead them into the land I am giving them!"
04Nm 20:13 This place was known as the waters of Meribah (which means "arguing") because there the people of Israel argued with the LORD, and there he demonstrated his holiness among them.
04Nm 20:14 While Moses was at Kadesh, he sent ambassadors to the king of Edom with this message�� "This is what your relatives, the people of Israel, say�� You know all the hardships we have been through.
04Nm 20:15 Our ancestors went down to Egypt, and we lived there a long time, and we and our ancestors were brutally mistreated by the Egyptians.
04Nm 20:16 But when we cried out to the LORD, he heard us and sent an angel who brought us out of Egypt. Now we are camped at Kadesh, a town on the border of your land.
04Nm 20:17 Please let us travel through your land. We will be careful not to go through your fields and vineyards. We won't even drink water from your wells. We will stay on the king's road and never leave it until we have passed through your territory."
04Nm 20:18 But the king of Edom said, "Stay out of my land, or I will meet you with an army!"
04Nm 20:19 The Israelites answered, "We will stay on the main road. If our livestock drink your water, we will pay for it. Just let us pass through your country. That's all we ask."
04Nm 20:20 But the king of Edom replied, "Stay out! You may not pass through our land." With that he mobilized his army and marched out against them with an imposing force.
04Nm 20:21 Because Edom refused to allow Israel to pass through their country, Israel was forced to turn around.
04Nm 20:22 The whole community of Israel left Kadesh and arrived at Mount Hor.
04Nm 20:23 There, on the border of the land of Edom, the LORD said to Moses and Aaron,
04Nm 20:24 "The time has come for Aaron to join his ancestors in death. He will not enter the land I am giving the people of Israel, because the two of you rebelled against my instructions concerning the water at Meribah.
04Nm 20:25 Now take Aaron and his son Eleazar up Mount Hor.
04Nm 20:26 There you will remove Aaron's priestly garments and put them on Eleazar, his son. Aaron will die there and join his ancestors."
04Nm 20:27 So Moses did as the LORD commanded. The three of them went up Mount Hor together as the whole community watched.
04Nm 20:28 At the summit, Moses removed the priestly garments from Aaron and put them on Eleazar, Aaron's son. Then Aaron died there on top of the mountain, and Moses and Eleazar went back down.
04Nm 20:29 When the people realized that Aaron had died, all Israel mourned for him thirty days.
04Nm 21:1 The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that the Israelites were approaching on the road through Atharim. So he attacked the Israelites and took some of them as prisoners.
04Nm 21:2 Then the people of Israel made this vow to the LORD�� "If you will hand these people over to us, we will completely destroy�� all their towns." / ��The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; also in 21.3
04Nm 21:3 The LORD heard the Israelites' request and gave them victory over the Canaanites. The Israelites completely destroyed them and their towns, and the place has been called Hormah�� ever since. / ��Hormah means "destruction"
04Nm 21:4 Then the people of Israel set out from Mount Hor, taking the road to the Red Sea�� to go around the land of Edom. But the people grew impatient with the long journey, / ��Hebrew sea of reeds
04Nm 21:5 and they began to speak against God and Moses. "Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die here in the wilderness?" they complained. "There is nothing to eat here and nothing to drink. And we hate this horrible manna!"
04Nm 21:6 So the LORD sent poisonous snakes among the people, and many were bitten and died.
04Nm 21:7 Then the people came to Moses and cried out, "We have sinned by speaking against the LORD and against you. Pray that the LORD will take away the snakes." So Moses prayed for the people.
04Nm 21:8 Then the LORD told him, "Make a replica of a poisonous snake and attach it to a pole. All who are bitten will live if they simply look at it!"
04Nm 21:9 So Moses made a snake out of bronze and attached it to a pole. Then anyone who was bitten by a snake could look at the bronze snake and be healed!
04Nm 21:10 The Israelites traveled next to Oboth and camped there.
04Nm 21:11 Then they went on to Iye-abarim, in the wilderness on the eastern border of Moab.
04Nm 21:12 From there they traveled to the valley of Zered Brook and set up camp.
04Nm 21:13 Then they moved out and camped on the far side of the Arnon River, in the wilderness adjacent to the territory of the Amorites. The Arnon is the boundary line between the Moabites and the Amorites.
04Nm 21:14 For this reason The Book of the Wars of the LORD speaks of "the town of Waheb in the area of Suphah, and the ravines of the Arnon River,
04Nm 21:15 and the ravines that extend as far as the settlement of Ar on the border of Moab."
04Nm 21:16 From there the Israelites traveled to Beer��, which is the well where the LORD said to Moses, "Assemble the people, and I will give them water." / ��Beer means "well"
04Nm 21:17 There the Israelites sang this song�� "Spring up, O well! Yes, sing its praises!
04Nm 21:18 Sing of this well, which princes dug, which great leaders hollowed out with their scepters and staffs." Then the Israelites left the wilderness and proceeded on through Mattanah,
04Nm 21:19 Nahaliel, and Bamoth.
04Nm 21:20 After that they went to the valley in Moab where Pisgah Peak overlooks the wasteland��. / ��Or overlooks Jeshimon
04Nm 21:21 The Israelites sent ambassadors to King Sihon of the Amorites with this message.
04Nm 21:22 "Let us travel through your land. We will be careful not to go through your fields and vineyards. We won't even drink water from your wells. We will stay on the king's road until we have passed through your territory."
04Nm 21:23 But King Sihon refused to let them cross his territory. Instead, he mobilized his entire army and attacked Israel in the wilderness, engaging them in battle at Jahaz.
04Nm 21:24 But the Israelites slaughtered them with their swords and occupied their land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River. They went only as far as the Ammonite border because the boundary of the Ammonites was fortified��. / ��Or because the terrain of the Ammonite frontier was rugged; Hebrew reads because the boundary of the Ammonites was strong
04Nm 21:25 So Israel captured all the towns of the Amorites and settled in them, including the city of Heshbon and its surrounding villages.
04Nm 21:26 Heshbon had been the capital of King Sihon of the Amorites. He had defeated a former Moabite king and seized all his land as far as the Arnon River.
04Nm 21:27 Therefore, the ancient poets wrote this about him�� "Come to Heshbon and let it be rebuilt! Let the city of Sihon be restored.
04Nm 21:28 A fire flamed forth from Heshbon, a blaze from the city of Sihon. It burned the city of Ar in Moab; it destroyed the rulers of the Arnon heights.
04Nm 21:29 What sorrow awaits you, O people of Moab! You are finished, O worshipers of Chemosh! Chemosh has left his sons as refugees, his daughters as captives of Sihon, the Amorite king.
04Nm 21:30 We have utterly destroyed them, from Heshbon to Dibon. We have completely wiped them out as far away as Nophah and Medeba��." / ��Or until fire spread to Medeba. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
04Nm 21:31 So the people of Israel occupied the territory of the Amorites.
04Nm 21:32 After Moses sent men to explore the Jazer area, they captured all the towns in the region and drove out the Amorites who lived there.
04Nm 21:33 Then they turned and marched up the road to Bashan, but King Og of Bashan and all his people attacked them at Edrei.
04Nm 21:34 The LORD said to Moses, "Do not be afraid of him, for I have handed him over to you, along with all his people and his land. Do the same to him as you did to King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon."
04Nm 21:35 And Israel killed King Og, his sons, and all his subjects; not a single survivor remained. Then Israel occupied their land.
04Nm 22:1 Then the people of Israel traveled to the plains of Moab and camped east of the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
04Nm 22:2 Balak son of Zippor, the Moabite king, had seen everything the Israelites did to the Amorites.
04Nm 22:3 And when the people of Moab saw how many Israelites there were, they were terrified.
04Nm 22:4 The king of Moab said to the elders of Midian, "This mob will devour everything in sight, like an ox devours grass in the field!" So Balak, king of Moab,
04Nm 22:5 sent messengers to call Balaam son of Beor, who was living in his native land of Pethor�� near the Euphrates River��. His message said�� "Look, a vast horde of people has arrived from Egypt. They cover the face of the earth and are threatening me. / ��Or who was at Pethor in the land of the Amavites ��Hebrew the river
04Nm 22:6 Please come and curse these people for me because they are too powerful for me. Then perhaps I will be able to conquer them and drive them from the land. I know that blessings fall on any people you bless, and curses fall on people you curse."
04Nm 22:7 Balak's messengers, who were elders of Moab and Midian, set out with money to pay Balaam to place a curse upon Israel��. They went to Balaam and delivered Balak's message to him. / ��Hebrew set out with the money of divination in their hand
04Nm 22:8 "Stay here overnight," Balaam said. "In the morning I will tell you whatever the LORD directs me to say." So the officials from Moab stayed there with Balaam.
04Nm 22:9 That night God came to Balaam and asked him, "Who are these men visiting you?"
04Nm 22:10 Balaam said to God, "Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent me this message.
04Nm 22:11 'Look, a vast horde of people has arrived from Egypt, and they cover the face of the earth. Come and curse these people for me. Then perhaps I will be able to stand up to them and drive them from the land.'"
04Nm 22:12 But God told Balaam, "Do not go with them. You are not to curse these people, for they have been blessed!"
04Nm 22:13 The next morning Balaam got up and told Balak's officials, "Go on home! The LORD will not let me go with you."
04Nm 22:14 So the Moabite officials returned to King Balak and reported, "Balaam refused to come with us."
04Nm 22:15 Then Balak tried again. This time he sent a larger number of even more distinguished officials than those he had sent the first time.
04Nm 22:16 They went to Balaam and delivered this message to him�� "This is what Balak son of Zippor says�� Please don't let anything stop you from coming to help me.
04Nm 22:17 I will pay you very well and do whatever you tell me. Just come and curse these people for me!"
04Nm 22:18 But Balaam responded to Balak's messengers, "Even if Balak were to give me his palace filled with silver and gold, I would be powerless to do anything against the will of the LORD my God.
04Nm 22:19 But stay here one more night, and I will see if the LORD has anything else to say to me."
04Nm 22:20 That night God came to Balaam and told him, "Since these men have come for you, get up and go with them. But do only what I tell you to do."
04Nm 22:21 So the next morning Balaam got up, saddled his donkey, and started off with the Moabite officials.
04Nm 22:22 But God was angry that Balaam was going, so he sent the angel of the LORD to stand in the road to block his way. As Balaam and two servants were riding along,
04Nm 22:23 Balaam's donkey saw the angel of the LORD standing in the road with a drawn sword in his hand. The donkey bolted off the road into a field, but Balaam beat it and turned it back onto the road.
04Nm 22:24 Then the angel of the LORD stood at a place where the road narrowed between two vineyard walls.
04Nm 22:25 When the donkey saw the angel of the LORD, it tried to squeeze by and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall. So Balaam beat the donkey again.
04Nm 22:26 Then the angel of the LORD moved farther down the road and stood in a place too narrow for the donkey to get by at all.
04Nm 22:27 This time when the donkey saw the angel, it lay down under Balaam. In a fit of rage Balaam beat the animal again with his staff.
04Nm 22:28 Then the LORD gave the donkey the ability to speak. "What have I done to you that deserves your beating me three times?" it asked Balaam.
04Nm 22:29 "You have made me look like a fool!" Balaam shouted. "If I had a sword with me, I would kill you!"
04Nm 22:30 "But I am the same donkey you have ridden all your life," the donkey answered. "Have I ever done anything like this before?" "No," Balaam admitted.
04Nm 22:31 Then the LORD opened Balaam's eyes, and he saw the angel of the LORD standing in the roadway with a drawn sword in his hand. Balaam bowed his head and fell face down on the ground before him.
04Nm 22:32 "Why did you beat your donkey those three times?" the angel of the LORD demanded. "Look, I have come to block your way because you are stubbornly resisting me.
04Nm 22:33 Three times the donkey saw me and shied away; otherwise, I would certainly have killed you by now and spared the donkey."
04Nm 22:34 Then Balaam confessed to the angel of the LORD, "I have sinned. I didn't realize you were standing in the road to block my way. I will return home if you are against my going."
04Nm 22:35 But the angel of the LORD told Balaam, "Go with these men, but say only what I tell you to say." So Balaam went on with Balak's officials.
04Nm 22:36 When King Balak heard that Balaam was on the way, he went out to meet him at a Moabite town on the Arnon River at the farthest border of his land.
04Nm 22:37 "Didn't I send you an urgent invitation? Why didn't you come right away?" Balak asked Balaam. "Didn't you believe me when I said I would reward you richly?"
04Nm 22:38 Balaam replied, "Look, now I have come, but I have no power to say whatever I want. I will speak only the message that God puts in my mouth."
04Nm 22:39 Then Balaam accompanied Balak to Kiriath-huzoth,
04Nm 22:40 where the king sacrificed cattle and sheep. He sent portions of the meat to Balaam and the officials who were with him.
04Nm 22:41 The next morning Balak took Balaam up to Bamoth-baal. From there he could see some of the people of Israel spread out below him.
04Nm 23:1 Then Balaam said to King Balak, "Build me seven altars here, and prepare seven young bulls and seven rams for me to sacrifice."
04Nm 23:2 Balak followed his instructions, and the two of them sacrificed a young bull and a ram on each altar.
04Nm 23:3 Then Balaam said to Balak, "Stand here by your burnt offerings, and I will go to see if the LORD will respond to me. Then I will tell you whatever he reveals to me." So Balaam went alone to the top of a bare hill,
04Nm 23:4 and God met him there. Balaam said to him, "I have prepared seven altars and have sacrificed a young bull and a ram on each altar."
04Nm 23:5 The LORD gave Balaam a message for King Balak. Then he said, "Go back to Balak and give him my message."
04Nm 23:6 So Balaam returned and found the king standing beside his burnt offerings with all the officials of Moab.
04Nm 23:7 This was the message Balaam delivered�� "Balak summoned me to come from Aram; the king of Moab brought me from the eastern hills. 'Come,' he said, 'curse Jacob for me! Come and announce Israel's doom.' 
04Nm 23:8 But how can I curse those whom God has not cursed? How can I condemn those whom the LORD has not condemned?
04Nm 23:9 I see them from the cliff tops; I watch them from the hills. I see a people who live by themselves, set apart from other nations.
04Nm 23:10 Who can count Jacob's descendants, as numerous as dust? Who can count even a fourth of Israel's people? Let me die like the righteous; let my life end like theirs."
04Nm 23:11 Then King Balak demanded of Balaam, "What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies. Instead, you have blessed them!"
04Nm 23:12 But Balaam replied, "I will speak only the message that the LORD puts in my mouth."
04Nm 23:13 Then King Balak told him, "Come with me to another place. There you will see another part of the nation of Israel, but not all of them. Curse at least that many!"
04Nm 23:14 So Balak took Balaam to the plateau of Zophim on Pisgah Peak. He built seven altars there and offered a young bull and a ram on each altar.
04Nm 23:15 Then Balaam said to the king, "Stand here by your burnt offerings while I go over there to meet the LORD."
04Nm 23:16 And the LORD met Balaam and gave him a message. Then he said, "Go back to Balak and give him my message."
04Nm 23:17 So Balaam returned and found the king standing beside his burnt offerings with all the officials of Moab. "What did the LORD say?" Balak asked eagerly.
04Nm 23:18 This was the message Balaam delivered�� "Rise up, Balak, and listen! Hear me, son of Zippor.
04Nm 23:19 God is not a man, so he does not lie.He is not human, so he does not change his mind. Has he ever spoken and failed to act? Has he ever promised and not carried it through?
04Nm 23:20 Listen, I received a command to bless; God has blessed, and I cannot reverse it!
04Nm 23:21 No misfortune is in his plan for Jacob; no trouble is in store for Israel. For the LORD their God is with them; he has been proclaimed their king.
04Nm 23:22 God brought them out of Egypt; for them he is as strong as a wild ox.
04Nm 23:23 No curse can touch Jacob; no magic has any power against Israel. For now it will be said of Jacob, 'What wonders God has done for Israel!'
04Nm 23:24 These people rise up like a lioness, like a majestic lion rousing itself. They refuse to rest until they have feasted on prey, drinking the blood of the slaughtered!"
04Nm 23:25 Then Balak said to Balaam, "Fine, but if you won't curse them, at least don't bless them!"
04Nm 23:26 But Balaam replied to Balak, "Didn't I tell you that I can do only what the LORD tells me?"
04Nm 23:27 Then King Balak said to Balaam, "Come, I will take you to one more place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them from there."
04Nm 23:28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor, overlooking the wasteland��. / ��Or overlooking Jeshimon
04Nm 23:29 Balaam again told Balak, "Build me seven altars, and prepare seven young bulls and seven rams for me to sacrifice."
04Nm 23:30 So Balak did as Balaam ordered and offered a young bull and a ram on each altar.
04Nm 24:1 By now Balaam realized that the LORD was determined to bless Israel, so he did not resort to divination as before. Instead, he turned and looked out toward the wilderness,
04Nm 24:2 where he saw the people of Israel camped, tribe by tribe. Then the Spirit of God came upon him,
04Nm 24:3 and this is the message he delivered�� "This is the message of Balaam son of Beor, the message of the man whose eyes see clearly,
04Nm 24:4 the message of one who hears the words of God, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who bows down with eyes wide open.
04Nm 24:5 How beautiful are your tents, O Jacob; how lovely are your homes, O Israel!
04Nm 24:6 They spread before me like palm groves��, like gardens by the riverside. They are like tall trees planted by the LORD, like cedars beside the waters. / ��Or like a majestic valley
04Nm 24:7 Water will flow from their buckets; their offspring have all they need. Their king will be greater than Agag; their kingdom will be exalted.
04Nm 24:8 God brought them out of Egypt; for them he is as strong as a wild ox. He devours all the nations that oppose him, breaking their bones in pieces, shooting them with arrows.
04Nm 24:9 Like a lion, Israel crouches and lies down; like a lioness, who dares to arouse her? Blessed is everyone who blesses you, O Israel, and cursed is everyone who curses you."
04Nm 24:10 King Balak flew into a rage against Balaam. He angrily clapped his hands and shouted, "I called you to curse my enemies! Instead, you have blessed them three times.
04Nm 24:11 Now get out of here! Go back home! I promised to reward you richly, but the LORD has kept you from your reward."
04Nm 24:12 Balaam told Balak, "Don't you remember what I told your messengers? I said,
04Nm 24:13 'Even if Balak were to give me his palace filled with silver and gold, I would be powerless to do anything against the will of the LORD.' I told you that I could say only what the LORD says!
04Nm 24:14 Now I am returning to my own people. But first let me tell you what the Israelites will do to your people in the future."
04Nm 24:15 This is the message Balaam delivered�� "This is the message of Balaam son of Beor, the message of the man whose eyes see clearly,
04Nm 24:16 the message of one who hears the words of God, who has knowledge from the Most High, who sees a vision from the Almighty, who bows down with eyes wide open.
04Nm 24:17 I see him, but not here and now.I perceive him, but far in the distant future. A star will rise from Jacob; a scepter will emerge from Israel. It will crush the foreheads of Moab's people, cracking the skulls of the people of Sheth.
04Nm 24:18 Edom will be taken over, and Seir, its enemy, will be conquered, while Israel marches on in triumph.
04Nm 24:19 A ruler will rise in Jacob who will destroy the survivors of Ir."
04Nm 24:20 Then Balaam looked over toward the people of Amalek and delivered this message�� "Amalek was the greatest of nations, but its destiny is destruction!"
04Nm 24:21 Then he looked over toward the Kenites and delivered this message�� "Your home is secure; your nest is set in the rocks.
04Nm 24:22 But the Kenites will be destroyed when Assyria�� takes you captive." / ��Hebrew Asshur; also in 24.24
04Nm 24:23 Balaam concluded his messages by saying�� "Alas, who can survive unless God has willed it?
04Nm 24:24 Ships will come from the coasts of Cyprus��; they will oppress Assyria and afflict Eber, but they, too, will be utterly destroyed." / ��Hebrew Kittim
04Nm 24:25 Then Balaam and Balak returned to their homes.
04Nm 25:1 While the Israelites were camped at Acacia Grove��, some of the men defiled themselves by having�� sexual relations with local Moabite women. / ��Hebrew Shittim ��As in Greek version; Hebrew reads some of the men began having
04Nm 25:2 These women invited them to attend sacrifices to their gods, so the Israelites feasted with them and worshiped the gods of Moab.
04Nm 25:3 In this way, Israel joined in the worship of Baal of Peor, causing the LORD's anger to blaze against his people.
04Nm 25:4 The LORD issued the following command to Moses�� "Seize all the ringleaders and execute them before the LORD in broad daylight, so his fierce anger will turn away from the people of Israel."
04Nm 25:5 So Moses ordered Israel's judges, "Each of you must put to death the men under your authority who have joined in worshiping Baal of Peor."
04Nm 25:6 Just then one of the Israelite men brought a Midianite woman into his tent, right before the eyes of Moses and all the people, as everyone was weeping at the entrance of the Tabernacle��. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting
04Nm 25:7 When Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest saw this, he jumped up and left the assembly. He took a spear
04Nm 25:8 and rushed after the man into his tent. Phinehas thrust the spear all the way through the man's body and into the woman's stomach. So the plague against the Israelites was stopped,
04Nm 25:9 but not before 24,000 people had died.
04Nm 25:10 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 25:11 "Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron the priest has turned my anger away from the Israelites by being as zealous among them as I was. So I stopped destroying all Israel as I had intended to do in my zealous anger.
04Nm 25:12 Now tell him that I am making my special covenant of peace with him.
04Nm 25:13 In this covenant, I give him and his descendants a permanent right to the priesthood, for in his zeal for me, his God, he purified the people of Israel, making them right with me��." / ��Or he made atonement for the people of Israel
04Nm 25:14 The Israelite man killed with the Midianite woman was named Zimri son of Salu, the leader of a family from the tribe of Simeon.
04Nm 25:15 The woman's name was Cozbi; she was the daughter of Zur, the leader of a Midianite clan.
04Nm 25:16 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 25:17 "Attack the Midianites and destroy them,
04Nm 25:18 because they assaulted you with deceit and tricked you into worshiping Baal of Peor, and because of Cozbi, the daughter of a Midianite leader, who was killed at the time of the plague because of what happened at Peor."
04Nm 26:1 After the plague had ended, the LORD said to Moses and to Eleazar son of Aaron the priest,
04Nm 26:2 "From the whole community of Israel, record the names of all the warriors by their families. List all the men twenty years old or older who are able to go to war."
04Nm 26:3 So there on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho, Moses and Eleazar the priest issued these instructions to the leaders of Israel.
04Nm 26:4 "List all the men of Israel twenty years old and older, just as the LORD commanded Moses." This is the record of all the descendants of Israel who came out of Egypt.

04Nm 26:51 In summary, the registered troops of all Israel numbered 601,730.
04Nm 26:52 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 26:53 "Divide the land among the tribes, and distribute the grants of land in proportion to the tribes' populations, as indicated by the number of names on the list.
04Nm 26:54 Give the larger tribes more land and the smaller tribes less land, each group receiving a grant in proportion to the size of its population.
04Nm 26:55 But you must assign the land by lot, and give land to each ancestral tribe according to the number of names on the list.
04Nm 26:56 Each grant of land must be assigned by lot among the larger and smaller tribal groups."
04Nm 26:57 This is the record of the Levites who were counted according to their clans�� The Gershonite clan, named after their ancestor Gershon. The Kohathite clan, named after their ancestor Kohath. The Merarite clan, named after their ancestor Merari.
04Nm 26:58 The Libnites, the Hebronites, the Mahlites, the Mushites, and the Korahites were all subclans of the Levites.Now Kohath was the ancestor of Amram,
04Nm 26:59 and Amram's wife was named Jochebed. She also was a descendant of Levi, born among the Levites in the land of Egypt. Amram and Jochebed became the parents of Aaron, Moses, and their sister, Miriam.
04Nm 26:60 To Aaron were born Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.
04Nm 26:61 But Nadab and Abihu died when they burned before the LORD the wrong kind of fire, different than he had commanded.
04Nm 26:62 The men from the Levite clans who were one month old or older numbered 23,000. But the Levites were not included in the registration of the rest of the people of Israel because they were not given an allotment of land when it was divided among the Israelites.
04Nm 26:63 So these are the results of the registration of the people of Israel as conducted by Moses and Eleazar the priest on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
04Nm 26:64 Not one person on this list had been among those listed in the previous registration taken by Moses and Aaron in the wilderness of Sinai.
04Nm 26:65 For the LORD had said of them, "They will all die in the wilderness." Not one of them survived except Caleb son of Jephunneh and Joshua son of Nun.
04Nm 27:1 One day a petition was presented by the daughters of Zelophehad - Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. Their father, Zelophehad, was a descendant of Hepher son of Gilead, son of Makir, son of Manasseh, son of Joseph.
04Nm 27:2 These women stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the tribal leaders, and the entire community at the entrance of the Tabernacle��. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting
04Nm 27:3 "Our father died in the wilderness," they said. "He was not among Korah's followers, who rebelled against the LORD; he died because of his own sin. But he had no sons.
04Nm 27:4 Why should the name of our father disappear from his clan just because he had no sons? Give us property along with the rest of our relatives."
04Nm 27:5 So Moses brought their case before the LORD.
04Nm 27:6 And the LORD replied to Moses,
04Nm 27:7 "The claim of the daughters of Zelophehad is legitimate. You must give them a grant of land along with their father's relatives. Assign them the property that would have been given to their father.
04Nm 27:8 "And give the following instructions to the people of Israel�� If a man dies and has no son, then give his inheritance to his daughters.
04Nm 27:9 And if he has no daughter either, transfer his inheritance to his brothers.
04Nm 27:10 If he has no brothers, give his inheritance to his father's brothers.
04Nm 27:11 But if his father has no brothers, give his inheritance to the nearest relative in his clan. This is a legal requirement for the people of Israel, just as the LORD commanded Moses."
04Nm 27:12 One day the LORD said to Moses, "Climb one of the mountains east of the river��, and look out over the land I have given the people of Israel. / ��Or the mountains of Abarim
04Nm 27:13 After you have seen it, you will die like your brother, Aaron,
04Nm 27:14 for you both rebelled against my instructions in the wilderness of Zin. When the people of Israel rebelled, you failed to demonstrate my holiness to them at the waters." (These are the waters of Meribah at Kadesh�� in the wilderness of Zin.) / ��Hebrew waters of Meribath-kadesh
04Nm 27:15 Then Moses said to the LORD,
04Nm 27:16 "O LORD, you are the God who gives breath to all creatures. Please appoint a new man as leader for the community.
04Nm 27:17 Give them someone who will guide them wherever they go and will lead them into battle, so the community of the LORD will not be like sheep without a shepherd."
04Nm 27:18 The LORD replied, "Take Joshua son of Nun, who has the Spirit in him, and lay your hands on him.
04Nm 27:19 Present him to Eleazar the priest before the whole community, and publicly commission him to lead the people.
04Nm 27:20 Transfer some of your authority to him so the whole community of Israel will obey him.
04Nm 27:21 When direction from the LORD is needed, Joshua will stand before Eleazar the priest, who will use the Urim - one of the sacred lots cast before the LORD - to determine his will. This is how Joshua and the rest of the community of Israel will determine everything they should do."
04Nm 27:22 So Moses did as the LORD commanded. He presented Joshua to Eleazar the priest and the whole community.
04Nm 27:23 Moses laid his hands on him and commissioned him to lead the people, just as the LORD had commanded through Moses.
04Nm 28:1 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 28:2 "Give these instructions to the people of Israel�� The offerings you present as special gifts are a pleasing aroma to me; they are my food. See to it that they are brought at the appointed times and offered according to my instructions.
04Nm 28:3 "Say to the people�� This is the special gift you must present to the LORD as your daily burnt offering. You must offer two one-year-old male lambs with no defects.

04Nm 29:11 You must also sacrifice one male goat for a sin offering. This is in addition to the sin offering of atonement and the regular daily burnt offering with its grain offering, and their accompanying liquid offerings.
04Nm 29:12 "Five days later, on the fifteenth day of the same month��, you must call another holy assembly of all the people, and you may do no ordinary work on that day. It is the beginning of the Festival of Shelters��, a seven-day festival to the LORD. / ��Hebrew On the fifteenth day of the seventh month; see 29.1, 7 and the notes there. This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late September, October, or early November ��Or Festival of Booths, or Festival of Tabernacles. This was earlier called the Festival of the Final Harvest or Festival of Ingathering (see Exod 23.16b). It is celebrated today as Sukkot (or Succoth)
04Nm 29:13 On the first day of the festival, you must present a burnt offering as a special gift, a pleasing aroma to the LORD. It will consist of thirteen young bulls, two rams, and fourteen one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects.
04Nm 29:14 Each of these offerings must be accompanied by a grain offering of choice flour moistened with olive oil - six quarts for each of the thirteen bulls, four quarts for each of the two rams,

04Nm 29:20 "On the third day of the festival, sacrifice eleven young bulls, two rams, and fourteen one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects.
04Nm 29:21 Each of these offerings of bulls, rams, and lambs must be accompanied by its prescribed grain offering and liquid offering.
04Nm 29:22 You must also sacrifice a male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its accompanying grain offering and liquid offering.
04Nm 29:23 "On the fourth day of the festival, sacrifice ten young bulls, two rams, and fourteen one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects.
04Nm 29:24 Each of these offerings of bulls, rams, and lambs must be accompanied by its prescribed grain offering and liquid offering.
04Nm 29:25 You must also sacrifice a male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its accompanying grain offering and liquid offering.
04Nm 29:26 "On the fifth day of the festival, sacrifice nine young bulls, two rams, and fourteen one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects.
04Nm 29:27 Each of these offerings of bulls, rams, and lambs must be accompanied by its prescribed grain offering and liquid offering.
04Nm 29:28 You must also sacrifice a male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its accompanying grain offering and liquid offering.
04Nm 29:29 "On the sixth day of the festival, sacrifice eight young bulls, two rams, and fourteen one-year-old male lambs, all with no defects.

04Nm 29:37 Each of these offerings must be accompanied by its prescribed grain offering and liquid offering.
04Nm 29:38 You must also sacrifice one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the regular burnt offering with its accompanying grain offering and liquid offering.
04Nm 29:39 "You must present these offerings to the LORD at your annual festivals. These are in addition to the sacrifices and offerings you present in connection with vows, or as voluntary offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, liquid offerings, or peace offerings."
04Nm 29:40 ��So Moses gave all of these instructions to the people of Israel as the LORD had commanded him. / ��Verse 29.40 is numbered 30.1 in Hebrew text
04Nm 30:1 ��Then Moses summoned the leaders of the tribes of Israel and told them, "This is what the LORD has commanded. / ��Verses 30.1-16 are numbered 30.2-17 in Hebrew text
04Nm 30:2 A man who makes a vow to the LORD or makes a pledge under oath must never break it. He must do exactly what he said he would do.
04Nm 30:3 "If a young woman makes a vow to the LORD or a pledge under oath while she is still living at her father's home,
04Nm 30:4 and her father hears of the vow or pledge and does not object to it, then all her vows and pledges will stand.
04Nm 30:5 But if her father refuses to let her fulfill the vow or pledge on the day he hears of it, then all her vows and pledges will become invalid. The LORD will forgive her because her father would not let her fulfill them.
04Nm 30:6 "Now suppose a young woman makes a vow or binds herself with an impulsive pledge and later marries.
04Nm 30:7 If her husband learns of her vow or pledge and does not object on the day he hears of it, her vows and pledges will stand.
04Nm 30:8 But if her husband refuses to accept her vow or impulsive pledge on the day he hears of it, he nullifies her commitments, and the LORD will forgive her.
04Nm 30:9 If, however, a woman is a widow or is divorced, she must fulfill all her vows and pledges.
04Nm 30:10 "But suppose a woman is married and living in her husband's home when she makes a vow or binds herself with a pledge.
04Nm 30:11 If her husband hears of it and does not object to it, her vow or pledge will stand.
04Nm 30:12 But if her husband refuses to accept it on the day he hears of it, her vow or pledge will be nullified, and the LORD will forgive her.
04Nm 30:13 So her husband may either confirm or nullify any vows or pledges she makes to deny herself.
04Nm 30:14 But if he does not object on the day he hears of it, then he is agreeing to all her vows and pledges.
04Nm 30:15 If he waits more than a day and then tries to nullify a vow or pledge, he will be punished for her guilt."
04Nm 30:16 These are the regulations the LORD gave Moses concerning relationships between a man and his wife, and between a father and a young daughter who still lives at home.
04Nm 31:1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 31:2 "On behalf of the people of Israel, take revenge on the Midianites for leading them into idolatry. After that, you will die and join your ancestors."
04Nm 31:3 So Moses said to the people, "Choose some men, and arm them to fight the LORD's war of revenge against Midian.
04Nm 31:4 From each tribe of Israel, send 1,000 men into battle."
04Nm 31:5 So they chose 1,000 men from each tribe of Israel, a total of 12,000 men armed for battle.
04Nm 31:6 Then Moses sent them out, 1,000 men from each tribe, and Phinehas son of Eleazar the priest led them into battle. They carried along the holy objects of the sanctuary and the trumpets for sounding the charge.
04Nm 31:7 They attacked Midian as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed all the men.
04Nm 31:8 All five of the Midianite kings - Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba - died in the battle. They also killed Balaam son of Beor with the sword.
04Nm 31:9 Then the Israelite army captured the Midianite women and children and seized their cattle and flocks and all their wealth as plunder.
04Nm 31:10 They burned all the towns and villages where the Midianites had lived.
04Nm 31:11 After they had gathered the plunder and captives, both people and animals,
04Nm 31:12 they brought them all to Moses and Eleazar the priest, and to the whole community of Israel, which was camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
04Nm 31:13 Moses, Eleazar the priest, and all the leaders of the community went to meet them outside the camp.
04Nm 31:14 But Moses was furious with all the generals and captains�� who had returned from the battle. / ��Hebrew the commanders of thousands, and the commanders of hundreds; also in 31.48, 52, 54
04Nm 31:15 "Why have you let all the women live?" he demanded.
04Nm 31:16 "These are the very ones who followed Balaam's advice and caused the people of Israel to rebel against the LORD at Mount Peor. They are the ones who caused the plague to strike the LORD's people.
04Nm 31:17 So kill all the boys and all the women who have had intercourse with a man.
04Nm 31:18 Only the young girls who are virgins may live; you may keep them for yourselves.
04Nm 31:19 And all of you who have killed anyone or touched a dead body must stay outside the camp for seven days. You must purify yourselves and your captives on the third and seventh days.
04Nm 31:20 Purify all your clothing, too, and everything made of leather, goat hair, or wood."
04Nm 31:21 Then Eleazar the priest said to the men who were in the battle, "The LORD has given Moses this legal requirement.
04Nm 31:22 Anything made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, tin, or lead - 
04Nm 31:23 that is, all metals that do not burn - must be passed through fire in order to be made ceremonially pure. These metal objects must then be further purified with the water of purification. But everything that burns must be purified by the water alone.
04Nm 31:24 On the seventh day you must wash your clothes and be purified. Then you may return to the camp."
04Nm 31:25 And the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 31:26 "You and Eleazar the priest and the family leaders of each tribe are to make a list of all the plunder taken in the battle, including the people and animals.
04Nm 31:27 Then divide the plunder into two parts, and give half to the men who fought the battle and half to the rest of the people.
04Nm 31:28 From the army's portion, first give the LORD his share of the plunder - one of every 500 of the prisoners and of the cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats.
04Nm 31:29 Give this share of the army's half to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the LORD.
04Nm 31:30 From the half that belongs to the people of Israel, take one of every fifty of the prisoners and of the cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, and other animals. Give this share to the Levites, who are in charge of maintaining the LORD's Tabernacle."
04Nm 31:31 So Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 31:32 The plunder remaining from everything the fighting men had taken totaled 675,000 sheep and goats,
04Nm 31:33 72,000 cattle,
04Nm 31:34 61,000 donkeys,
04Nm 31:35 and 32,000 virgin girls.
04Nm 31:36 Half of the plunder was given to the fighting men. It totaled 337,500 sheep and goats,
04Nm 31:37 of which 675 were the LORD's share;
04Nm 31:38 36,000 cattle, of which 72 were the LORD's share;
04Nm 31:39 30,500 donkeys, of which 61 were the LORD's share;
04Nm 31:40 and 16,000 virgin girls, of whom 32 were the LORD's share.
04Nm 31:41 Moses gave all the LORD's share to Eleazar the priest, just as the LORD had directed him.
04Nm 31:42 Half of the plunder belonged to the people of Israel, and Moses separated it from the half belonging to the fighting men.
04Nm 31:43 It totaled 337,500 sheep and goats,
04Nm 31:44 36,000 cattle,
04Nm 31:45 30,500 donkeys,
04Nm 31:46 and 16,000 virgin girls.
04Nm 31:47 From the half-share given to the people, Moses took one of every fifty prisoners and animals and gave them to the Levites, who maintained the LORD's Tabernacle. All this was done as the LORD had commanded Moses.
04Nm 31:48 Then all the generals and captains came to Moses
04Nm 31:49 and said, "We, your servants, have accounted for all the men who went out to battle under our command; not one of us is missing!
04Nm 31:50 So we are presenting the items of gold we captured as an offering to the LORD from our share of the plunder - armbands, bracelets, rings, earrings, and necklaces. This will purify our lives before the LORD and make us right with him��." / ��Or will make atonement for our lives before the LORD
04Nm 31:51 So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from all the military commanders - all kinds of jewelry and crafted objects.
04Nm 31:52 In all, the gold that the generals and captains presented as a gift to the LORD weighed about 420 pounds��. / ��Hebrew 16,750 shekels [191 kilograms]
04Nm 31:53 All the fighting men had taken some of the plunder for themselves.
04Nm 31:54 So Moses and Eleazar the priest accepted the gifts from the generals and captains and brought the gold to the Tabernacle�� as a reminder to the LORD that the people of Israel belong to him. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting
04Nm 32:1 The tribes of Reuben and Gad owned vast numbers of livestock. So when they saw that the lands of Jazer and Gilead were ideally suited for their flocks and herds,
04Nm 32:2 they came to Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the other leaders of the community. They said,
04Nm 32:3 "Notice the towns of Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sibmah��, Nebo, and Beon. / ��As in Samaritan Pentateuch and Greek version (see also 32.38); Hebrew reads Sebam
04Nm 32:4 The LORD has conquered this whole area for the community of Israel, and it is ideally suited for all our livestock.
04Nm 32:5 If we have found favor with you, please let us have this land as our property instead of giving us land across the Jordan River."
04Nm 32:6 "Do you intend to stay here while your brothers go across and do all the fighting?" Moses asked the men of Gad and Reuben.
04Nm 32:7 "Why do you want to discourage the rest of the people of Israel from going across to the land the LORD has given them?
04Nm 32:8 Your ancestors did the same thing when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to explore the land.
04Nm 32:9 After they went up to the valley of Eshcol and explored the land, they discouraged the people of Israel from entering the land the LORD was giving them.
04Nm 32:10 Then the LORD was very angry with them, and he vowed,
04Nm 32:11 'Of all those I rescued from Egypt, no one who is twenty years old or older will ever see the land I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, for they have not obeyed me wholeheartedly.
04Nm 32:12 The only exceptions are Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua son of Nun, for they have wholeheartedly followed the LORD.'
04Nm 32:13 "The LORD was angry with Israel and made them wander in the wilderness for forty years until the entire generation that sinned in the LORD's sight had died.
04Nm 32:14 But here you are, a brood of sinners, doing exactly the same thing! You are making the LORD even angrier with Israel.
04Nm 32:15 If you turn away from him like this and he abandons them again in the wilderness, you will be responsible for destroying this entire nation!"
04Nm 32:16 But they approached Moses and said, "We simply want to build pens for our livestock and fortified towns for our wives and children.
04Nm 32:17 Then we will arm ourselves and lead our fellow Israelites into battle until we have brought them safely to their land. Meanwhile, our families will stay in the fortified towns we build here, so they will be safe from any attacks by the local people.
04Nm 32:18 We will not return to our homes until all the people of Israel have received their portions of land.
04Nm 32:19 But we do not claim any of the land on the other side of the Jordan. We would rather live here on the east side and accept this as our grant of land."
04Nm 32:20 Then Moses said, "If you keep your word and arm yourselves for the LORD's battles,
04Nm 32:21 and if your troops cross the Jordan and keep fighting until the LORD has driven out his enemies,
04Nm 32:22 then you may return when the LORD has conquered the land. You will have fulfilled your duty to the LORD and to the rest of the people of Israel. And the land on the east side of the Jordan will be your property from the LORD.
04Nm 32:23 But if you fail to keep your word, then you will have sinned against the LORD, and you may be sure that your sin will find you out.
04Nm 32:24 Go ahead and build towns for your families and pens for your flocks, but do everything you have promised."
04Nm 32:25 Then the men of Gad and Reuben replied, "We, your servants, will follow your instructions exactly.
04Nm 32:26 Our children, wives, flocks, and cattle will stay here in the towns of Gilead.
04Nm 32:27 But all who are able to bear arms will cross over to fight for the LORD, just as you have said."
04Nm 32:28 So Moses gave orders to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of the clans of Israel.
04Nm 32:29 He said, "The men of Gad and Reuben who are armed for battle must cross the Jordan with you to fight for the LORD. If they do, give them the land of Gilead as their property when the land is conquered.
04Nm 32:30 But if they refuse to arm themselves and cross over with you, then they must accept land with the rest of you in the land of Canaan."
04Nm 32:31 The tribes of Gad and Reuben said again, "We are your servants, and we will do as the LORD has commanded!
04Nm 32:32 We will cross the Jordan into Canaan fully armed to fight for the LORD, but our property will be here on this side of the Jordan."
04Nm 32:33 So Moses assigned land to the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and half the tribe of Manasseh son of Joseph. He gave them the territory of King Sihon of the Amorites and the land of King Og of Bashan - the whole land with its cities and surrounding lands.
04Nm 32:34 The descendants of Gad built the towns of Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer,
04Nm 32:35 Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah,
04Nm 32:36 Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran. These were all fortified towns with pens for their flocks.
04Nm 32:37 The descendants of Reuben built the towns of Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim,
04Nm 32:38 Nebo, Baal-meon, and Sibmah. They changed the names of some of the towns they conquered and rebuilt.
04Nm 32:39 Then the descendants of Makir of the tribe of Manasseh went to Gilead and conquered it, and they drove out the Amorites living there.
04Nm 32:40 So Moses gave Gilead to the Makirites, descendants of Manasseh, and they settled there.
04Nm 32:41 The people of Jair, another clan of the tribe of Manasseh, captured many of the towns in Gilead and changed the name of that region to the Towns of Jair��. / ��Hebrew Havvoth-jair
04Nm 32:42 Meanwhile, a man named Nobah captured the town of Kenath and its surrounding villages, and he renamed that area Nobah after himself.
04Nm 33:1 This is the route the Israelites followed as they marched out of Egypt under the leadership of Moses and Aaron.
04Nm 33:2 At the LORD's direction, Moses kept a written record of their progress. These are the stages of their march, identified by the different places where they stopped along the way.
04Nm 33:3 They set out from the city of Rameses in early spring - on the fifteenth day of the first month�� - on the morning after the first Passover celebration. The people of Israel left defiantly, in full view of all the Egyptians. / ��This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late March, April, or early May
04Nm 33:4 Meanwhile, the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn sons, whom the LORD had killed the night before. The LORD had defeated the gods of Egypt that night with great acts of judgment!
04Nm 33:5 After leaving Rameses, the Israelites set up camp at Succoth.
04Nm 33:6 Then they left Succoth and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness.
04Nm 33:7 They left Etham and turned back toward Pi-hahiroth, opposite Baal-zephon, and camped near Migdol.
04Nm 33:8 They left Pi-hahiroth and crossed the Red Sea�� into the wilderness beyond. Then they traveled for three days into the Etham wilderness and camped at Marah. / ��Hebrew the sea
04Nm 33:9 They left Marah and camped at Elim, where there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees.
04Nm 33:10 They left Elim and camped beside the Red Sea��. / ��Hebrew sea of reeds; also in 33.11
04Nm 33:11 They left the Red Sea and camped in the wilderness of Sin��. / ��The geographical name Sin is related to Sinai and should not be confused with the English word sin
04Nm 33:12 They left the wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah.
04Nm 33:13 They left Dophkah and camped at Alush.
04Nm 33:14 They left Alush and camped at Rephidim, where there was no water for the people to drink.
04Nm 33:15 They left Rephidim and camped in the wilderness of Sinai.
04Nm 33:16 They left the wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah.
04Nm 33:17 They left Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth.
04Nm 33:18 They left Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah.
04Nm 33:19 They left Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez.
04Nm 33:20 They left Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah.
04Nm 33:21 They left Libnah and camped at Rissah.
04Nm 33:22 They left Rissah and camped at Kehelathah.
04Nm 33:23 They left Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher.
04Nm 33:24 They left Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah.
04Nm 33:25 They left Haradah and camped at Makheloth.
04Nm 33:26 They left Makheloth and camped at Tahath.
04Nm 33:27 They left Tahath and camped at Terah.
04Nm 33:28 They left Terah and camped at Mithcah.
04Nm 33:29 They left Mithcah and camped at Hashmonah.
04Nm 33:30 They left Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth.
04Nm 33:31 They left Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan.
04Nm 33:32 They left Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad.
04Nm 33:33 They left Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah.
04Nm 33:34 They left Jotbathah and camped at Abronah.
04Nm 33:35 They left Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber.
04Nm 33:36 They left Ezion-geber and camped at Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin.
04Nm 33:37 They left Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, at the border of Edom.
04Nm 33:38 While they were at the foot of Mount Hor, Aaron the priest was directed by the LORD to go up the mountain, and there he died. This happened in midsummer, on the first day of the fifth month�� of the fortieth year after Israel's departure from Egypt. / ��This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in July or August
04Nm 33:39 Aaron was 123 years old when he died there on Mount Hor.
04Nm 33:40 At that time the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard that the people of Israel were approaching his land.
04Nm 33:41 Meanwhile, the Israelites left Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah.
04Nm 33:42 Then they left Zalmonah and camped at Punon.
04Nm 33:43 They left Punon and camped at Oboth.
04Nm 33:44 They left Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim on the border of Moab.
04Nm 33:45 They left Iye-abarim�� and camped at Dibon-gad. / ��As in 33.44; Hebrew reads Iyim, another name for Iye-abarim
04Nm 33:46 They left Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim.
04Nm 33:47 They left Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains east of the river��, near Mount Nebo. / ��Or the mountains of Abarim; also in 33.48
04Nm 33:48 They left the mountains east of the river and camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
04Nm 33:49 Along the Jordan River they camped from Beth-jeshimoth as far as the meadows of Acacia�� on the plains of Moab. / ��Hebrew as far as Abel-shittim
04Nm 33:50 While they were camped near the Jordan River on the plains of Moab opposite Jericho, the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 33:51 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel�� When you cross the Jordan River into the land of Canaan,
04Nm 33:52 you must drive out all the people living there. You must destroy all their carved and molten images and demolish all their pagan shrines.
04Nm 33:53 Take possession of the land and settle in it, because I have given it to you to occupy.
04Nm 33:54 You must distribute the land among the clans by sacred lot and in proportion to their size. A larger portion of land will be allotted to each of the larger clans, and a smaller portion will be allotted to each of the smaller clans. The decision of the sacred lot is final. In this way, the portions of land will be divided among your ancestral tribes.
04Nm 33:55 But if you fail to drive out the people who live in the land, those who remain will be like splinters in your eyes and thorns in your sides. They will harass you in the land where you live.
04Nm 33:56 And I will do to you what I had planned to do to them."
04Nm 34:1 Then the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 34:2 "Give these instructions to the Israelites�� When you come into the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as your special possession, these will be the boundaries.
04Nm 34:3 The southern portion of your country will extend from the wilderness of Zin, along the edge of Edom. The southern boundary will begin on the east at the Dead Sea��. / ��Hebrew Salt Sea; also in 34.12
04Nm 34:4 It will then run south past Scorpion Pass�� in the direction of Zin. Its southernmost point will be Kadesh-barnea, from which it will go to Hazar-addar, and on to Azmon. / ��Or the ascent of Akrabbim
04Nm 34:5 From Azmon the boundary will turn toward the Brook of Egypt and end at the Mediterranean Sea��. / ��Hebrew the sea; also in 34.6, 7

04Nm 34:8 then to Lebo-hamath, and on through Zedad
04Nm 34:9 and Ziphron to Hazar-enan. This will be your northern boundary.
04Nm 34:10 "The eastern boundary will start at Hazar-enan and run south to Shepham,
04Nm 34:11 then down to Riblah on the east side of Ain. From there the boundary will run down along the eastern edge of the Sea of Galilee��, / ��Hebrew Sea of Kinnereth
04Nm 34:12 and then along the Jordan River to the Dead Sea. These are the boundaries of your land."
04Nm 34:13 Then Moses told the Israelites, "This territory is the homeland you are to divide among yourselves by sacred lot. The LORD has commanded that the land be divided among the nine and a half remaining tribes.
04Nm 34:14 The families of the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh have already received their grants of land
04Nm 34:15 on the east side of the Jordan River, across from Jericho toward the sunrise."
04Nm 34:16 And the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 34:17 "Eleazar the priest and Joshua son of Nun are the men designated to divide the grants of land among the people.
04Nm 34:18 Enlist one leader from each tribe to help them with the task.
04Nm 34:19 These are the tribes and the names of the leaders�� Judah Caleb son of Jephunneh 
04Nm 34:20 Simeon Shemuel son of Ammihud 
04Nm 34:21 Benjamin Elidad son of Kislon 
04Nm 34:22 Dan Bukki son of Jogli 
04Nm 34:23 Manasseh son of Joseph Hanniel son of Ephod 
04Nm 34:24 Ephraim son of Joseph Kemuel son of Shiphtan 
04Nm 34:25 Zebulun Elizaphan son of Parnach 
04Nm 34:26 Issachar Paltiel son of Azzan 
04Nm 34:27 Asher Ahihud son of Shelomi 
04Nm 34:28 Naphtali Pedahel son of Ammihud 
04Nm 34:29 These are the men the LORD has appointed to divide the grants of land in Canaan among the Israelites."
04Nm 35:1 While Israel was camped beside the Jordan on the plains of Moab across from Jericho, the LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 35:2 "Command the people of Israel to give to the Levites from their property certain towns to live in, along with the surrounding pasturelands.
04Nm 35:3 These towns will be for the Levites to live in, and the surrounding lands will provide pasture for their cattle, flocks, and other livestock.
04Nm 35:4 The pastureland assigned to the Levites around these towns will extend 1,500 feet�� from the town walls in every direction. / ��Hebrew 1,000 cubits [460 meters]
04Nm 35:5 Measure off 3,000 feet�� outside the town walls in every direction - east, south, west, north - with the town at the center. This area will serve as the larger pastureland for the towns. / ��Hebrew 2,000 cubits [920 meters]
04Nm 35:6 "Six of the towns you give the Levites will be cities of refuge, where a person who has accidentally killed someone can flee for safety. In addition, give them forty-two other towns.
04Nm 35:7 In all, forty-eight towns with the surrounding pastureland will be given to the Levites.
04Nm 35:8 These towns will come from the property of the people of Israel. The larger tribes will give more towns to the Levites, while the smaller tribes will give fewer. Each tribe will give property in proportion to the size of its land."
04Nm 35:9 The LORD said to Moses,
04Nm 35:10 "Give the following instructions to the people of Israel."When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan,
04Nm 35:11 designate cities of refuge to which people can flee if they have killed someone accidentally.
04Nm 35:12 These cities will be places of protection from a dead person's relatives who want to avenge the death. The slayer must not be put to death before being tried by the community.
04Nm 35:13 Designate six cities of refuge for yourselves,
04Nm 35:14 three on the east side of the Jordan River and three on the west in the land of Canaan.
04Nm 35:15 These cities are for the protection of Israelites, foreigners living among you, and traveling merchants. Anyone who accidentally kills someone may flee there for safety.
04Nm 35:16 "But if someone strikes and kills another person with a piece of iron, it is murder, and the murderer must be executed.
04Nm 35:17 Or if someone with a stone in his hand strikes and kills another person, it is murder, and the murderer must be put to death.
04Nm 35:18 Or if someone strikes and kills another person with a wooden object, it is murder, and the murderer must be put to death.
04Nm 35:19 The victim's nearest relative is responsible for putting the murderer to death. When they meet, the avenger must put the murderer to death.
04Nm 35:20 So if someone hates another person and pushes him or throws a dangerous object at him and he dies, it is murder.
04Nm 35:21 Or if someone hates another person and hits him with a fist and he dies, it is murder. In such cases, the avenger must put the murderer to death when they meet.
04Nm 35:22 "But suppose someone pushes another person without having shown previous hostility, or throws something that unintentionally hits another person,
04Nm 35:23 or accidentally drops a huge stone on someone, though they were not enemies, and the person dies.
04Nm 35:24 If this should happen, the community must follow these regulations in making a judgment between the slayer and the avenger, the victim's nearest relative.
04Nm 35:25 The community must protect the slayer from the avenger and must escort the slayer back to live in the city of refuge to which he fled. There he must remain until the death of the high priest, who was anointed with the sacred oil.
04Nm 35:26 "But if the slayer ever leaves the limits of the city of refuge,
04Nm 35:27 and the avenger finds him outside the city and kills him, it will not be considered murder.
04Nm 35:28 The slayer should have stayed inside the city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the death of the high priest, the slayer may return to his own property.
04Nm 35:29 These are legal requirements for you to observe from generation to generation, wherever you may live.
04Nm 35:30 "All murderers must be put to death, but only if evidence is presented by more than one witness. No one may be put to death on the testimony of only one witness.
04Nm 35:31 Also, you must never accept a ransom payment for the life of someone judged guilty of murder and subject to execution; murderers must always be put to death.
04Nm 35:32 And never accept a ransom payment from someone who has fled to a city of refuge, allowing a slayer to return to his property before the death of the high priest.
04Nm 35:33 This will ensure that the land where you live will not be polluted, for murder pollutes the land. And no sacrifice except the execution of the murderer can purify the land from murder��. / ��Or can make atonement for murder
04Nm 35:34 You must not defile the land where you live, for I live there myself. I am the LORD, who lives among the people of Israel."
04Nm 36:1 Then the heads of the clans of Gilead - descendants of Makir, son of Manasseh, son of Joseph - came to Moses and the family leaders of Israel with a petition.
04Nm 36:2 They said, "Sir, the LORD instructed you to divide the land by sacred lot among the people of Israel. You were told by the LORD to give the grant of land owned by our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
04Nm 36:3 But if they marry men from another tribe, their grants of land will go with them to the tribe into which they marry. In this way, the total area of our tribal land will be reduced.
04Nm 36:4 Then when the Year of Jubilee comes, their portion of land will be added to that of the new tribe, causing it to be lost forever to our ancestral tribe."
04Nm 36:5 So Moses gave the Israelites this command from the LORD�� "The claim of the men of the tribe of Joseph is legitimate.
04Nm 36:6 This is what the LORD commands concerning the daughters of Zelophehad�� Let them marry anyone they like, as long as it is within their own ancestral tribe.
04Nm 36:7 None of the territorial land may pass from tribe to tribe, for all the land given to each tribe must remain within the tribe to which it was first allotted.
04Nm 36:8 The daughters throughout the tribes of Israel who are in line to inherit property must marry within their tribe, so that all the Israelites will keep their ancestral property.
04Nm 36:9 No grant of land may pass from one tribe to another; each tribe of Israel must keep its allotted portion of land."
04Nm 36:10 The daughters of Zelophehad did as the LORD commanded Moses.
04Nm 36:11 Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah all married cousins on their father's side.
04Nm 36:12 They married into the clans of Manasseh son of Joseph. Thus, their inheritance of land remained within their ancestral tribe.
04Nm 36:13 These are the commands and regulations that the LORD gave to the people of Israel through Moses while they were camped on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River across from Jericho.
