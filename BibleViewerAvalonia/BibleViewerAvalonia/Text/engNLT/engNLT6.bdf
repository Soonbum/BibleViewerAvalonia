40Mt 1:10 Hezekiah was the father of Manasseh. Manasseh was the father of Amon®Á. Amon was the father of Josiah. / ®ÁGreek Amos, a variant spelling of Amon; also in 1.10b. See 1 Chr 3.14

40Mt 1:17 All those listed above include fourteen generations from Abraham to David, fourteen from David to the Babylonian exile, and fourteen from the Babylonian exile to the Messiah.
40Mt 1:18 This is how Jesus the Messiah was born. His mother, Mary, was engaged to be married to Joseph. But before the marriage took place, while she was still a virgin, she became pregnant through the power of the Holy Spirit.
40Mt 1:19 Joseph, her fiance, was a good man and did not want to disgrace her publicly, so he decided to break the engagement®Á quietly. / ®ÁGreek to divorce her
40Mt 1:20 As he considered this, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. "Joseph, son of David," the angel said, "do not be afraid to take Mary as your wife. For the child within her was conceived by the Holy Spirit.
40Mt 1:21 And she will have a son, and you are to name him Jesus®Á, for he will save his people from their sins." / ®ÁJesus means "The LORD saves."
40Mt 1:22 All of this occurred to fulfill the Lord's message through his prophet.
40Mt 1:23 "Look! The virgin will conceive a child! She will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel®Á, which means `God is with us.'" / ®ÁIsa 7.14; 8.8, 10 (Greek version)
40Mt 1:24 When Joseph woke up, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded and took Mary as his wife.
40Mt 1:25 But he did not have sexual relations with her until her son was born. And Joseph named him Jesus.
40Mt 2:1 Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the reign of King Herod. About that time some wise men®Á from eastern lands arrived in Jerusalem, asking, / ®ÁOr royal astrologers; Greek reads magi; also in 2.7, 16
40Mt 2:2 "Where is the newborn king of the Jews - We saw his star as it rose®Á, and we have come to worship him." / ®ÁOr star in the east
40Mt 2:3 King Herod was deeply disturbed when he heard this, as was everyone in Jerusalem.
40Mt 2:4 He called a meeting of the leading priests and teachers of religious law and asked, "Where is the Messiah supposed to be born?"
40Mt 2:5 "In Bethlehem in Judea," they said, "for this is what the prophet wrote.
40Mt 2:6 `And you, O Bethlehem in the land of Judah, are not least among the ruling cities®Á of Judah, for a ruler will come from you who will be the shepherd for my people Israel.'®Ë" / ®ÁGreek the rulers ®ËMic 5.2; 2 Sam 5.2
40Mt 2:7 Then Herod called for a private meeting with the wise men, and he learned from them the time when the star first appeared.
40Mt 2:8 Then he told them, "Go to Bethlehem and search carefully for the child. And when you find him, come back and tell me so that I can go and worship him, too!"
40Mt 2:9 After this interview the wise men went their way. And the star they had seen in the east guided them to Bethlehem. It went ahead of them and stopped over the place where the child was.
40Mt 2:10 When they saw the star, they were filled with joy!
40Mt 2:11 They entered the house and saw the child with his mother, Mary, and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure chests and gave him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
40Mt 2:12 When it was time to leave, they returned to their own country by another route, for God had warned them in a dream not to return to Herod.
40Mt 2:13 After the wise men were gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up! Flee to Egypt with the child and his mother," the angel said. "Stay there until I tell you to return, because Herod is going to search for the child to kill him."
40Mt 2:14 That night Joseph left for Egypt with the child and Mary, his mother,
40Mt 2:15 and they stayed there until Herod's death. This fulfilled what the Lord had spoken through the prophet£∫ "I called my Son out of Egypt."®Á / ®ÁHos 11.1
40Mt 2:16 Herod was furious when he realized that the wise men had outwitted him. He sent soldiers to kill all the boys in and around Bethlehem who were two years old and under, based on the wise men's report of the star's first appearance.
40Mt 2:17 Herod's brutal action fulfilled what God had spoken through the prophet Jeremiah.
40Mt 2:18 "A cry was heard in Ramah - weeping and great mourning. Rachel weeps for her children, refusing to be comforted, for they are dead."®Á / ®ÁJer 31.15
40Mt 2:19 When Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.
40Mt 2:20 "Get up!" the angel said. "Take the child and his mother back to the land of Israel, because those who were trying to kill the child are dead."
40Mt 2:21 So Joseph got up and returned to the land of Israel with Jesus and his mother.
40Mt 2:22 But when he learned that the new ruler of Judea was Herod's son Archelaus, he was afraid to go there. Then, after being warned in a dream, he left for the region of Galilee.
40Mt 2:23 So the family went and lived in a town called Nazareth. This fulfilled what the prophets had said£∫ "He will be called a Nazarene."
40Mt 3:1 In those days John the Baptist came to the Judean wilderness and began preaching. His message was,
40Mt 3:2 "Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near®Á." / ®ÁOr has come, or is coming soon
40Mt 3:3 The prophet Isaiah was speaking about John when he said, "He is a voice shouting in the wilderness, `Prepare the way for the LORD's coming! Clear the road for him!'"®Á / ®ÁIsa 40.3 (Greek version)
40Mt 3:4 John's clothes were woven from coarse camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food he ate locusts and wild honey.
40Mt 3:5 People from Jerusalem and from all of Judea and all over the Jordan Valley went out to see and hear John.
40Mt 3:6 And when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.
40Mt 3:7 But when he saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to watch him baptize®Á, he denounced them. "You brood of snakes!" he exclaimed. "Who warned you to flee God's coming wrath? / ®ÁOr coming to be baptized
40Mt 3:8 Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God.
40Mt 3:9 Don't just say to each other, `We're safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.' That means nothing, for I tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these very stones.
40Mt 3:10 Even now the ax of God's judgment is poised, ready to sever the roots of the trees. Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire.
40Mt 3:11 "I baptize with®Á water those who repent of their sins and turn to God. But someone is coming soon who is greater than I am - so much greater that I'm not worthy even to be his slave and carry his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire®Ë. / ®ÁOr in ®ËOr in the Holy Spirit and in fire
40Mt 3:12 He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire."
40Mt 3:13 Then Jesus went from Galilee to the Jordan River to be baptized by John.
40Mt 3:14 But John tried to talk him out of it. "I am the one who needs to be baptized by you," he said, "so why are you coming to me?"
40Mt 3:15 But Jesus said, "It should be done, for we must carry out all that God requires®Á." So John agreed to baptize him. / ®ÁOr for we must fulfill all righteousness
40Mt 3:16 After his baptism, as Jesus came up out of the water, the heavens were opened®Á and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and settling on him. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read opened to him
40Mt 3:17 And a voice from heaven said, "This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy."
40Mt 4:1 Then Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted there by the devil.
40Mt 4:2 For forty days and forty nights he fasted and became very hungry.
40Mt 4:3 During that time the devil®Á came and said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell these stones to become loaves of bread." / ®ÁGreek the tempter
40Mt 4:4 But Jesus told him, "No! The Scriptures say, `People do not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.'®Á" / ®ÁDeut 8.3
40Mt 4:5 Then the devil took him to the holy city, Jerusalem, to the highest point of the Temple,
40Mt 4:6 and said, "If you are the Son of God, jump off! For the Scriptures say, `He will order his angels to protect you. And they will hold you up with their hands so you won't even hurt your foot on a stone.'®Á" / ®ÁPs 91.11-12
40Mt 4:7 Jesus responded, "The Scriptures also say, `You must not test the LORD your God.'®Á" / ®ÁDeut 6.16
40Mt 4:8 Next the devil took him to the peak of a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory.
40Mt 4:9 "I will give it all to you," he said, "if you will kneel down and worship me."
40Mt 4:10 "Get out of here, Satan," Jesus told him. "For the Scriptures say, `You must worship the LORD your God and serve only him.'®Á" / ®ÁDeut 6.13
40Mt 4:11 Then the devil went away, and angels came and took care of Jesus.
40Mt 4:12 When Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he left Judea and returned to Galilee.
40Mt 4:13 He went first to Nazareth, then left there and moved to Capernaum, beside the Sea of Galilee, in the region of Zebulun and Naphtali.
40Mt 4:14 This fulfilled what God said through the prophet Isaiah.
40Mt 4:15 "In the land of Zebulun and of Naphtali, beside the sea, beyond the Jordan River, in Galilee where so many Gentiles live,
40Mt 4:16 the people who sat in darkness have seen a great light. And for those who lived in the land where death casts its shadow, a light has shined."®Á / ®ÁIsa 9.1-2 ®Á (Greek version)
40Mt 4:17 From then on Jesus began to preach, "Repent of your sins and turn to God, for the Kingdom of Heaven is near®Á." / ®ÁOr has come, or is coming soon
40Mt 4:18 One day as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers - Simon, also called Peter, and Andrew - throwing a net into the water, for they fished for a living.
40Mt 4:19 Jesus called out to them, "Come, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people!"
40Mt 4:20 And they left their nets at once and followed him.
40Mt 4:21 A little farther up the shore he saw two other brothers, James and John, sitting in a boat with their father, Zebedee, repairing their nets. And he called them to come, too.
40Mt 4:22 They immediately followed him, leaving the boat and their father behind.
40Mt 4:23 Jesus traveled throughout the region of Galilee, teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom. And he healed every kind of disease and illness.
40Mt 4:24 News about him spread as far as Syria, and people soon began bringing to him all who were sick. And whatever their sickness or disease, or if they were demon possessed or epileptic or paralyzed - he healed them all.
40Mt 4:25 Large crowds followed him wherever he went - people from Galilee, the Ten Towns®Á, Jerusalem, from all over Judea, and from east of the Jordan River. / ®ÁGreek Decapolis
40Mt 5:1 One day as he saw the crowds gathering, Jesus went up on the mountainside and sat down. His disciples gathered around him,
40Mt 5:2 and he began to teach them.
40Mt 5:3 "God blesses those who are poor and realize their need for him®Á, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs. / ®ÁGreek poor in spirit
40Mt 5:4 God blesses those who mourn, for they will be comforted.
40Mt 5:5 God blesses those who are humble, for they will inherit the whole earth.
40Mt 5:6 God blesses those who hunger and thirst for justice®Á, for they will be satisfied. / ®ÁOr for righteousness
40Mt 5:7 God blesses those who are merciful, for they will be shown mercy.
40Mt 5:8 God blesses those whose hearts are pure, for they will see God.
40Mt 5:9 God blesses those who work for peace, for they will be called the children of God.
40Mt 5:10 God blesses those who are persecuted for doing right, for the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs.
40Mt 5:11 "God blesses you when people mock you and persecute you and lie about you®Á and say all sorts of evil things against you because you are my followers. / ®ÁSome manuscripts omit and lie about you
40Mt 5:12 Be happy about it! Be very glad! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, the ancient prophets were persecuted in the same way.
40Mt 5:13 "You are the salt of the earth. But what good is salt if it has lost its flavor? Can you make it salty again? It will be thrown out and trampled underfoot as worthless.
40Mt 5:14 "You are the light of the world - like a city on a hilltop that cannot be hidden.
40Mt 5:15 No one lights a lamp and then puts it under a basket. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where it gives light to everyone in the house.
40Mt 5:16 In the same way, let your good deeds shine out for all to see, so that everyone will praise your heavenly Father.
40Mt 5:17 "Don't misunderstand why I have come. I did not come to abolish the law of Moses or the writings of the prophets. No, I came to accomplish their purpose.
40Mt 5:18 I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not even the smallest detail of God's law will disappear until its purpose is achieved.
40Mt 5:19 So if you ignore the least commandment and teach others to do the same, you will be called the least in the Kingdom of Heaven. But anyone who obeys God's laws and teaches them will be called great in the Kingdom of Heaven.
40Mt 5:20 "But I warn you - unless your righteousness is better than the righteousness of the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees, you will never enter the Kingdom of Heaven!
40Mt 5:21 "You have heard that our ancestors were told, `You must not murder. If you commit murder, you are subject to judgment.'®Á / ®ÁExod 20.13; Deut 5.17
40Mt 5:22 But I say, if you are even angry with someone®Á, you are subject to judgment! If you call someone an idiot®Ë, you are in danger of being brought before the court. And if you curse someone®È, you are in danger of the fires of hell®Í. / ®ÁSome manuscripts add without cause ®ËGreek uses an Aramaic term of contempt£∫ If you say to your brother, `Raca' ®ÈGreek if you say, `You fool' ®ÍGreek Gehenna; also in 5.29, 30
40Mt 5:23 "So if you are presenting a sacrifice®Á at the altar in the Temple and you suddenly remember that someone has something against you, / ®ÁGreek gift; also in 5.24
40Mt 5:24 leave your sacrifice there at the altar. Go and be reconciled to that person. Then come and offer your sacrifice to God.
40Mt 5:25 "When you are on the way to court with your adversary, settle your differences quickly. Otherwise, your accuser may hand you over to the judge, who will hand you over to an officer, and you will be thrown into prison.
40Mt 5:26 And if that happens, you surely won't be free again until you have paid the last penny®Á. / ®ÁGreek the last kodrantes [i.e., quadrans]
40Mt 5:27 "You have heard the commandment that says, `You must not commit adultery.'®Á / ®ÁExod 20.14; Deut 5.18
40Mt 5:28 But I say, anyone who even looks at a woman with lust has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
40Mt 5:29 So if your eye - even your good eye®Á - causes you to lust, gouge it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. / ®ÁGreek your right eye
40Mt 5:30 And if your hand - even your stronger hand®Á - causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one part of your body than for your whole body to be thrown into hell. / ®ÁGreek your right hand
40Mt 5:31 "You have heard the law that says, `A man can divorce his wife by merely giving her a written notice of divorce.'®Á / ®ÁDeut 24.1
40Mt 5:32 But I say that a man who divorces his wife, unless she has been unfaithful, causes her to commit adultery. And anyone who marries a divorced woman also commits adultery.
40Mt 5:33 "You have also heard that our ancestors were told, `You must not break your vows; you must carry out the vows you make to the LORD.'®Á / ®ÁNum 30.2
40Mt 5:34 But I say, do not make any vows! Do not say, `By heaven!' because heaven is God's throne.
40Mt 5:35 And do not say, `By the earth!' because the earth is his footstool. And do not say, `By Jerusalem!' for Jerusalem is the city of the great King.
40Mt 5:36 Do not even say, `By my head!' for you can't turn one hair white or black.
40Mt 5:37 Just say a simple, `Yes, I will,' or `No, I won't.' Anything beyond this is from the evil one.
40Mt 5:38 "You have heard the law that says the punishment must match the injury£∫ `An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.'®Á / ®ÁGreek the law that says£∫ `An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' Exod 21.24; Lev 24.20; Deut 19.21
40Mt 5:39 But I say, do not resist an evil person! If someone slaps you on the right cheek, offer the other cheek also.
40Mt 5:40 If you are sued in court and your shirt is taken from you, give your coat, too.
40Mt 5:41 If a soldier demands that you carry his gear for a mile®Á, carry it two miles. / ®ÁGreek milion [4,854 feet or 1,478 meters]
40Mt 5:42 Give to those who ask, and don't turn away from those who want to borrow.
40Mt 5:43 "You have heard the law that says, `Love your neighbor'®Á and hate your enemy. / ®ÁLev 19.18
40Mt 5:44 But I say, love your enemies!®Á Pray for those who persecute you! / ®ÁSome manuscripts add Bless those who curse you. Do good to those who hate you. Compare Luke 6.27-28
40Mt 5:45 In that way, you will be acting as true children of your Father in heaven. For he gives his sunlight to both the evil and the good, and he sends rain on the just and the unjust alike.
40Mt 5:46 If you love only those who love you, what reward is there for that? Even corrupt tax collectors do that much.
40Mt 5:47 If you are kind only to your friends®Á, how are you different from anyone else? Even pagans do that. / ®ÁGreek your brothers
40Mt 5:48 But you are to be perfect, even as your Father in heaven is perfect.
40Mt 6:1 "Watch out! Don't do your good deeds publicly, to be admired by others, for you will lose the reward from your Father in heaven.
40Mt 6:2 When you give to someone in need, don't do as the hypocrites do - blowing trumpets in the synagogues and streets to call attention to their acts of charity! I tell you the truth, they have received all the reward they will ever get.
40Mt 6:3 But when you give to someone in need, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing.
40Mt 6:4 Give your gifts in private, and your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.
40Mt 6:5 "When you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to pray publicly on street corners and in the synagogues where everyone can see them. I tell you the truth, that is all the reward they will ever get.
40Mt 6:6 But when you pray, go away by yourself, shut the door behind you, and pray to your Father in private. Then your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.
40Mt 6:7 "When you pray, don't babble on and on as people of other religions do. They think their prayers are answered merely by repeating their words again and again.
40Mt 6:8 Don't be like them, for your Father knows exactly what you need even before you ask him!
40Mt 6:9 Pray like this£∫ Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy. 
40Mt 6:10 May your Kingdom come soon. May your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven.
40Mt 6:11 Give us today the food we need®Á, / ®ÁOr Give us today our food for the day; or Give us today our food for tomorrow
40Mt 6:12 and forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those who sin against us.
40Mt 6:13 And don't let us yield to temptation®Á, but rescue us from the evil one®Ë. / ®ÁOr And keep us from being tested ®ËOr from evil. Some manuscripts add For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen
40Mt 6:14 "If you forgive those who sin against you, your heavenly Father will forgive you.
40Mt 6:15 But if you refuse to forgive others, your Father will not forgive your sins.
40Mt 6:16 "And when you fast, don't make it obvious, as the hypocrites do, for they try to look miserable and disheveled so people will admire them for their fasting. I tell you the truth, that is the only reward they will ever get.
40Mt 6:17 But when you fast, comb your hair and wash your face.
40Mt 6:18 Then no one will notice that you are fasting, except your Father, who knows what you do in private. And your Father, who sees everything, will reward you.
40Mt 6:19 "Don't store up treasures here on earth, where moths eat them and rust destroys them, and where thieves break in and steal.
40Mt 6:20 Store your treasures in heaven, where moths and rust cannot destroy, and thieves do not break in and steal.
40Mt 6:21 Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.
40Mt 6:22 "Your eye is a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is filled with light.
40Mt 6:23 But when your eye is bad, your whole body is filled with darkness. And if the light you think you have is actually darkness, how deep that darkness is!
40Mt 6:24 "No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money.
40Mt 6:25 "That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life - whether you have enough food and drink, or enough clothes to wear. Isn't life more than food, and your body more than clothing?
40Mt 6:26 Look at the birds. They don't plant or harvest or store food in barns, for your heavenly Father feeds them. And aren't you far more valuable to him than they are?
40Mt 6:27 Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?
40Mt 6:28 "And why worry about your clothing? Look at the lilies of the field and how they grow. They don't work or make their clothing,
40Mt 6:29 yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are.
40Mt 6:30 And if God cares so wonderfully for wildflowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith?
40Mt 6:31 "So don't worry about these things, saying, `What will we eat? What will we drink? What will we wear?'
40Mt 6:32 These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers, but your heavenly Father already knows all your needs.

40Mt 6:34 "So don't worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will bring its own worries. Today's trouble is enough for today.
40Mt 7:1 "Do not judge others, and you will not be judged.
40Mt 7:2 For you will be treated as you treat others®Á. The standard you use in judging is the standard by which you will be judged®Ë. / ®ÁOr For God will judge you as you judge others ®ËOr The measure you give will be the measure you get back

40Mt 7:12 "Do to others whatever you would like them to do to you. This is the essence of all that is taught in the law and the prophets.
40Mt 7:13 "You can enter God's Kingdom only through the narrow gate. The highway to hell®Á is broad, and its gate is wide for the many who choose that way. / ®ÁGreek The road that leads to destruction
40Mt 7:14 But the gateway to life is very narrow and the road is difficult, and only a few ever find it.
40Mt 7:15 "Beware of false prophets who come disguised as harmless sheep but are really vicious wolves.
40Mt 7:16 You can identify them by their fruit, that is, by the way they act. Can you pick grapes from thornbushes, or figs from thistles?
40Mt 7:17 A good tree produces good fruit, and a bad tree produces bad fruit.
40Mt 7:18 A good tree can't produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit.
40Mt 7:19 So every tree that does not produce good fruit is chopped down and thrown into the fire.
40Mt 7:20 Yes, just as you can identify a tree by its fruit, so you can identify people by their actions.
40Mt 7:21 "Not everyone who calls out to me, `Lord! Lord!' will enter the Kingdom of Heaven. Only those who actually do the will of my Father in heaven will enter.
40Mt 7:22 On judgment day many will say to me, `Lord! Lord! We prophesied in your name and cast out demons in your name and performed many miracles in your name.'
40Mt 7:23 But I will reply, `I never knew you. Get away from me, you who break God's laws.'
40Mt 7:24 "Anyone who listens to my teaching and follows it is wise, like a person who builds a house on solid rock.
40Mt 7:25 Though the rain comes in torrents and the floodwaters rise and the winds beat against that house, it won't collapse because it is built on bedrock.
40Mt 7:26 But anyone who hears my teaching and doesn't obey it is foolish, like a person who builds a house on sand.
40Mt 7:27 When the rains and floods come and the winds beat against that house, it will collapse with a mighty crash."
40Mt 7:28 When Jesus had finished saying these things, the crowds were amazed at his teaching,
40Mt 7:29 for he taught with real authority - quite unlike their teachers of religious law.
40Mt 8:1 Large crowds followed Jesus as he came down the mountainside.
40Mt 8:2 Suddenly, a man with leprosy approached him and knelt before him. "Lord," the man said, "if you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean."
40Mt 8:3 Jesus reached out and touched him. "I am willing," he said. "Be healed!" And instantly the leprosy disappeared.
40Mt 8:4 Then Jesus said to him, "Don't tell anyone about this. Instead, go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy®Á. This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed." / ®ÁSee Lev 14.2-32
40Mt 8:5 When Jesus returned to Capernaum, a Roman officer®Á came and pleaded with him, / ®ÁGreek a centurion; similarly in 8.8, 13
40Mt 8:6 "Lord, my young servant®Á lies in bed, paralyzed and in terrible pain." / ®ÁOr child; also in 8.13
40Mt 8:7 Jesus said, "I will come and heal him."
40Mt 8:8 But the officer said, "Lord, I am not worthy to have you come into my home. Just say the word from where you are, and my servant will be healed.
40Mt 8:9 I know this because I am under the authority of my superior officers, and I have authority over my soldiers. I only need to say, `Go,' and they go, or `Come,' and they come. And if I say to my slaves, `Do this,' they do it."
40Mt 8:10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. Turning to those who were following him, he said, "I tell you the truth, I haven't seen faith like this in all Israel!
40Mt 8:11 And I tell you this, that many Gentiles will come from all over the world - from east and west - and sit down with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob at the feast in the Kingdom of Heaven.
40Mt 8:12 But many Israelites - those for whom the Kingdom was prepared - will be thrown into outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40Mt 8:13 Then Jesus said to the Roman officer, "Go back home. Because you believed, it has happened." And the young servant was healed that same hour.
40Mt 8:14 When Jesus arrived at Peter's house, Peter's mother-in-law was sick in bed with a high fever.
40Mt 8:15 But when Jesus touched her hand, the fever left her. Then she got up and prepared a meal for him.
40Mt 8:16 That evening many demon-possessed people were brought to Jesus. He cast out the evil spirits with a simple command, and he healed all the sick.
40Mt 8:17 This fulfilled the word of the Lord through the prophet Isaiah, who said, "He took our sicknesses and removed our diseases."®Á / ®ÁIsa 53.4
40Mt 8:18 When Jesus saw the crowd around him, he instructed his disciples to cross to the other side of the lake.
40Mt 8:19 Then one of the teachers of religious law said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go."
40Mt 8:20 But Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens to live in, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man®Á has no place even to lay his head." / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
40Mt 8:21 Another of his disciples said, "Lord, first let me return home and bury my father."
40Mt 8:22 But Jesus told him, "Follow me now. Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead®Á." / ®ÁGreek Let the dead bury their own dead
40Mt 8:23 Then Jesus got into the boat and started across the lake with his disciples.
40Mt 8:24 Suddenly, a fierce storm struck the lake, with waves breaking into the boat. But Jesus was sleeping.
40Mt 8:25 The disciples went and woke him up, shouting, "Lord, save us! We're going to drown!"
40Mt 8:26 Jesus responded, "Why are you afraid? You have so little faith!" Then he got up and rebuked the wind and waves, and suddenly there was a great calm.
40Mt 8:27 The disciples were amazed. "Who is this man?" they asked. "Even the winds and waves obey him!"
40Mt 8:28 When Jesus arrived on the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gadarenes®Á, two men who were possessed by demons met him. They lived in a cemetery and were so violent that no one could go through that area. / ®ÁOther manuscripts read Gerasenes; still others read Gergesenes. Compare Mark 5.1; Luke 8.26
40Mt 8:29 They began screaming at him, "Why are you interfering with us, Son of God? Have you come here to torture us before God's appointed time?"
40Mt 8:30 There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding in the distance.
40Mt 8:31 So the demons begged, "If you cast us out, send us into that herd of pigs."
40Mt 8:32 "All right, go!" Jesus commanded them. So the demons came out of the men and entered the pigs, and the whole herd plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned in the water.
40Mt 8:33 The herdsmen fled to the nearby town, telling everyone what happened to the demon-possessed men.
40Mt 8:34 Then the entire town came out to meet Jesus, but they begged him to go away and leave them alone.
40Mt 9:1 Jesus climbed into a boat and went back across the lake to his own town.
40Mt 9:2 Some people brought to him a paralyzed man on a mat. Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "Be encouraged, my child! Your sins are forgiven."
40Mt 9:3 But some of the teachers of religious law said to themselves, "That's blasphemy! Does he think he's God?"
40Mt 9:4 Jesus knew®Á what they were thinking, so he asked them, "Why do you have such evil thoughts in your hearts? / ®ÁSome manuscripts read saw
40Mt 9:5 Is it easier to say `Your sins are forgiven,' or `Stand up and walk'?
40Mt 9:6 So I will prove to you that the Son of Man®Á has the authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, "Stand up, pick up your mat, and go home!" / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
40Mt 9:7 And the man jumped up and went home!
40Mt 9:8 Fear swept through the crowd as they saw this happen. And they praised God for sending a man with such great authority®Á. / ®ÁGreek for giving such authority to human beings
40Mt 9:9 As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at his tax collector's booth. "Follow me and be my disciple," Jesus said to him. So Matthew got up and followed him.
40Mt 9:10 Later, Matthew invited Jesus and his disciples to his home as dinner guests, along with many tax collectors and other disreputable sinners.
40Mt 9:11 But when the Pharisees saw this, they asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with such scum?®Á" / ®ÁGreek with tax collectors and sinners?
40Mt 9:12 When Jesus heard this, he said, "Healthy people don't need a doctor - sick people do."
40Mt 9:13 Then he added, "Now go and learn the meaning of this Scripture£∫ `I want you to show mercy, not offer sacrifices.'®Á For I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners." / ®ÁHos 6.6 [Greek version]
40Mt 9:14 One day the disciples of John the Baptist came to Jesus and asked him, "Why don't your disciples fast®Á like we do and the Pharisees do?" / ®ÁSome manuscripts read fast often
40Mt 9:15 Jesus replied, "Do wedding guests mourn while celebrating with the groom? Of course not. But someday the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
40Mt 9:16 "Besides, who would patch old clothing with new cloth? For the new patch would shrink and rip away from the old cloth, leaving an even bigger tear than before.
40Mt 9:17 "And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the old skins would burst from the pressure, spilling the wine and ruining the skins. New wine is stored in new wineskins so that both are preserved."
40Mt 9:18 As Jesus was saying this, the leader of a synagogue came and knelt before him. "My daughter has just died," he said, "but you can bring her back to life again if you just come and lay your hand on her."
40Mt 9:19 So Jesus and his disciples got up and went with him.
40Mt 9:20 Just then a woman who had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding came up behind him. She touched the fringe of his robe,
40Mt 9:21 for she thought, "If I can just touch his robe, I will be healed."
40Mt 9:22 Jesus turned around, and when he saw her he said, "Daughter, be encouraged! Your faith has made you well." And the woman was healed at that moment.
40Mt 9:23 When Jesus arrived at the official's home, he saw the noisy crowd and heard the funeral music.
40Mt 9:24 "Get out!" he told them. "The girl isn't dead; she's only asleep." But the crowd laughed at him.
40Mt 9:25 After the crowd was put outside, however, Jesus went in and took the girl by the hand, and she stood up!
40Mt 9:26 The report of this miracle swept through the entire countryside.
40Mt 9:27 After Jesus left the girl's home, two blind men followed along behind him, shouting, "Son of David, have mercy on us!"
40Mt 9:28 They went right into the house where he was staying, and Jesus asked them, "Do you believe I can make you see?" "Yes, Lord," they told him, "we do."
40Mt 9:29 Then he touched their eyes and said, "Because of your faith, it will happen."
40Mt 9:30 Then their eyes were opened, and they could see! Jesus sternly warned them, "Don't tell anyone about this."
40Mt 9:31 But instead, they went out and spread his fame all over the region.
40Mt 9:32 When they left, a demon-possessed man who couldn't speak was brought to Jesus.
40Mt 9:33 So Jesus cast out the demon, and then the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed. "Nothing like this has ever happened in Israel!" they exclaimed.
40Mt 9:34 But the Pharisees said, "He can cast out demons because he is empowered by the prince of demons."
40Mt 9:35 Jesus traveled through all the towns and villages of that area, teaching in the synagogues and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom. And he healed every kind of disease and illness.
40Mt 9:36 When he saw the crowds, he had compassion on them because they were confused and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd.
40Mt 9:37 He said to his disciples, "The harvest is great, but the workers are few.
40Mt 9:38 So pray to the Lord who is in charge of the harvest; ask him to send more workers into his fields."
40Mt 10:1 Jesus called his twelve disciples together and gave them authority to cast out evil®Á spirits and to heal every kind of disease and illness. / ®ÁGreek unclean

40Mt 10:15 I tell you the truth, the wicked cities of Sodom and Gomorrah will be better off than such a town on the judgment day.
40Mt 10:16 "Look, I am sending you out as sheep among wolves. So be as shrewd as snakes and harmless as doves.
40Mt 10:17 But beware! For you will be handed over to the courts and will be flogged with whips in the synagogues.

40Mt 11:1 When Jesus had finished giving these instructions to his twelve disciples, he went out to teach and preach in towns throughout the region.
40Mt 11:2 John the Baptist, who was in prison, heard about all the things the Messiah was doing. So he sent his disciples to ask Jesus,
40Mt 11:3 "Are you the Messiah we've been expecting®Á, or should we keep looking for someone else?" / ®ÁGreek Are you the one who is coming?
40Mt 11:4 Jesus told them, "Go back to John and tell him what you have heard and seen?

40Mt 11:6 And tell him, `God blesses those who do not turn away because of me®Á.'" / ®ÁOr who are not offended by me
40Mt 11:7 As John's disciples were leaving, Jesus began talking about him to the crowds. "What kind of man did you go into the wilderness to see? Was he a weak reed, swayed by every breath of wind?
40Mt 11:8 Or were you expecting to see a man dressed in expensive clothes? No, people with expensive clothes live in palaces.
40Mt 11:9 Were you looking for a prophet? Yes, and he is more than a prophet.
40Mt 11:10 John is the man to whom the Scriptures refer when they say, `Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way before you.'®Á / ®ÁMal 3.1
40Mt 11:11 "I tell you the truth, of all who have ever lived, none is greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least person in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he is!
40Mt 11:12 And from the time John the Baptist began preaching until now, the Kingdom of Heaven has been forcefully advancing®Á, and violent people are attacking it. / ®ÁOr the Kingdom of Heaven has suffered from violence
40Mt 11:13 For before John came, all the prophets and the law of Moses looked forward to this present time.

40Mt 11:15 Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!
40Mt 11:16 "To what can I compare this generation? It is like children playing a game in the public square. They complain to their friends,
40Mt 11:17 `We played wedding songs, and you didn't dance, so we played funeral songs, and you didn't mourn.'
40Mt 11:18 For John didn't spend his time eating and drinking, and you say, `He's possessed by a demon.'
40Mt 11:19 The Son of Man®Á, on the other hand, feasts and drinks, and you say, `He's a glutton and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!' But wisdom is shown to be right by its results." / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
40Mt 11:20 Then Jesus began to denounce the towns where he had done so many of his miracles, because they hadn't repented of their sins and turned to God.
40Mt 11:21 "What sorrow awaits you, Korazin and Bethsaida! For if the miracles I did in you had been done in wicked Tyre and Sidon, their people would have repented of their sins long ago, clothing themselves in burlap and throwing ashes on their heads to show their remorse.
40Mt 11:22 I tell you, Tyre and Sidon will be better off on judgment day than you.
40Mt 11:23 "And you people of Capernaum, will you be honored in heaven? No, you will go down to the place of the dead®Á. For if the miracles I did for you had been done in wicked Sodom, it would still be here today. / ®ÁGreek to Hades
40Mt 11:24 I tell you, even Sodom will be better off on judgment day than you."
40Mt 11:25 At that time Jesus prayed this prayer£∫ "O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever, and for revealing them to the childlike.
40Mt 11:26 Yes, Father, it pleased you to do it this way!
40Mt 11:27 "My Father has entrusted everything to me. No one truly knows the Son except the Father, and no one truly knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
40Mt 11:28 Then Jesus said, "Come to me, all of you who are weary and carry heavy burdens, and I will give you rest.
40Mt 11:29 Take my yoke upon you. Let me teach you, because I am humble and gentle at heart, and you will find rest for your souls.
40Mt 11:30 For my yoke is easy to bear, and the burden I give you is light."
40Mt 12:1 At about that time Jesus was walking through some grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, so they began breaking off some heads of grain and eating them.
40Mt 12:2 But some Pharisees saw them do it and protested, "Look, your disciples are breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath."
40Mt 12:3 Jesus said to them, "Haven't you read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
40Mt 12:4 He went into the house of God, and he and his companions broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests are allowed to eat.
40Mt 12:5 And haven't you read in the law of Moses that the priests on duty in the Temple may work on the Sabbath?
40Mt 12:6 I tell you, there is one here who is even greater than the Temple!
40Mt 12:7 But you would not have condemned my innocent disciples if you knew the meaning of this Scripture£∫ `I want you to show mercy, not offer sacrifices.'®Á / ®ÁHos 6.6 (Greek version)
40Mt 12:8 For the Son of Man®Á is Lord, even over the Sabbath!" / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
40Mt 12:9 Then Jesus went over to their synagogue,
40Mt 12:10 where he noticed a man with a deformed hand. The Pharisees asked Jesus, "Does the law permit a person to work by healing on the Sabbath?" (They were hoping he would say yes, so they could bring charges against him.)
40Mt 12:11 And he answered, "If you had a sheep that fell into a well on the Sabbath, wouldn't you work to pull it out? Of course you would.
40Mt 12:12 And how much more valuable is a person than a sheep! Yes, the law permits a person to do good on the Sabbath."
40Mt 12:13 Then he said to the man, "Hold out your hand." So the man held out his hand, and it was restored, just like the other one!
40Mt 12:14 Then the Pharisees called a meeting to plot how to kill Jesus.
40Mt 12:15 But Jesus knew what they were planning. So he left that area, and many people followed him. He healed all the sick among them,
40Mt 12:16 but he warned them not to reveal who he was.
40Mt 12:17 This fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah concerning him.
40Mt 12:18 "Look at my Servant, whom I have chosen. He is my Beloved, who pleases me. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the nations.
40Mt 12:19 He will not fight or shout or raise his voice in public. 
40Mt 12:20 He will not crush the weakest reed or put out a flickering candle. Finally he will cause justice to be victorious.
40Mt 12:21 And his name will be the hope of all the world."®Á / ®ÁIsa 42.1-4 [Greek version for 42.4]
40Mt 12:22 Then a demon-possessed man, who was blind and couldn't speak, was brought to Jesus. He healed the man so that he could both speak and see.
40Mt 12:23 The crowd was amazed and asked, "Could it be that Jesus is the Son of David, the Messiah?"
40Mt 12:24 But when the Pharisees heard about the miracle, they said, "No wonder he can cast out demons. He gets his power from Satan®Á, the prince of demons." / ®ÁGreek Beelzeboul; also in 12.27. Other manuscripts read Beezeboul; Latin version reads Beelzebub
40Mt 12:25 Jesus knew their thoughts and replied, "Any kingdom divided by civil war is doomed. A town or family splintered by feuding will fall apart.
40Mt 12:26 And if Satan is casting out Satan, he is divided and fighting against himself. His own kingdom will not survive.
40Mt 12:27 And if I am empowered by Satan, what about your own exorcists? They cast out demons, too, so they will condemn you for what you have said.
40Mt 12:28 But if I am casting out demons by the Spirit of God, then the Kingdom of God has arrived among you.
40Mt 12:29 For who is powerful enough to enter the house of a strong man like Satan and plunder his goods? Only someone even stronger - someone who could tie him up and then plunder his house.
40Mt 12:30 "Anyone who isn't with me opposes me, and anyone who isn't working with me is actually working against me.
40Mt 12:31 "So I tell you, every sin and blasphemy can be forgiven - except blasphemy against the Holy Spirit, which will never be forgiven.
40Mt 12:32 Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven, but anyone who speaks against the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven, either in this world or in the world to come.
40Mt 12:33 "A tree is identified by its fruit. If a tree is good, its fruit will be good. If a tree is bad, its fruit will be bad.
40Mt 12:34 You brood of snakes! How could evil men like you speak what is good and right? For whatever is in your heart determines what you say.
40Mt 12:35 A good person produces good things from the treasury of a good heart, and an evil person produces evil things from the treasury of an evil heart.
40Mt 12:36 And I tell you this, you must give an account on judgment day for every idle word you speak.
40Mt 12:37 The words you say will either acquit you or condemn you."
40Mt 12:38 One day some teachers of religious law and Pharisees came to Jesus and said, "Teacher, we want you to show us a miraculous sign to prove your authority."
40Mt 12:39 But Jesus replied, "Only an evil, adulterous generation would demand a miraculous sign; but the only sign I will give them is the sign of the prophet Jonah.
40Mt 12:40 For as Jonah was in the belly of the great fish for three days and three nights, so will the Son of Man be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
40Mt 12:41 "The people of Nineveh will stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it, for they repented of their sins at the preaching of Jonah. Now someone greater than Jonah is here - but you refuse to repent.
40Mt 12:42 The queen of Sheba®Á will also stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it, for she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Now someone greater than Solomon is here - but you refuse to listen. / ®ÁGreek The queen of the south
40Mt 12:43 "When an evil®Á spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, seeking rest but finding none. / ®ÁGreek unclean
40Mt 12:44 Then it says, `I will return to the person I came from.' So it returns and finds its former home empty, swept, and in order.
40Mt 12:45 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before. That will be the experience of this evil generation."
40Mt 12:46 As Jesus was speaking to the crowd, his mother and brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him.
40Mt 12:47 Someone told Jesus, "Your mother and your brothers are outside, and they want to speak to you."®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include verse 47. Compare Mark 3.32 and Luke 8.20
40Mt 12:48 Jesus asked, "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?"
40Mt 12:49 Then he pointed to his disciples and said, "Look, these are my mother and brothers.
40Mt 12:50 Anyone who does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother!"
40Mt 13:1 Later that same day Jesus left the house and sat beside the lake.
40Mt 13:2 A large crowd soon gathered around him, so he got into a boat. Then he sat there and taught as the people stood on the shore.
40Mt 13:3 He told many stories in the form of parables, such as this one£∫ "Listen! A farmer went out to plant some seeds.
40Mt 13:4 As he scattered them across his field, some seeds fell on a footpath, and the birds came and ate them.
40Mt 13:5 Other seeds fell on shallow soil with underlying rock. The seeds sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.
40Mt 13:6 But the plants soon wilted under the hot sun, and since they didn't have deep roots, they died.
40Mt 13:7 Other seeds fell among thorns that grew up and choked out the tender plants.
40Mt 13:8 Still other seeds fell on fertile soil, and they produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times as much as had been planted!
40Mt 13:9 Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand."
40Mt 13:10 His disciples came and asked him, "Why do you use parables when you talk to the people?"
40Mt 13:11 He replied, "You are permitted to understand the secrets®Á of the Kingdom of Heaven, but others are not. / ®ÁGreek the mysteries
40Mt 13:12 To those who listen to my teaching, more understanding will be given, and they will have an abundance of knowledge. But for those who are not listening, even what little understanding they have will be taken away from them.
40Mt 13:13 That is why I use these parables, For they look, but they don't really see. They hear, but they don't really listen or understand. 
40Mt 13:14 This fulfills the prophecy of Isaiah that says, `When you hear what I say, you will not understand. When you see what I do, you will not comprehend.
40Mt 13:15 For the hearts of these people are hardened, and their ears cannot hear, and they have closed their eyes? so their eyes cannot see, and their ears cannot hear, and their hearts cannot understand, and they cannot turn to me and let me heal them.'®Á / ®ÁIsa 6.9-10 (Greek version)
40Mt 13:16 "But blessed are your eyes, because they see; and your ears, because they hear.
40Mt 13:17 I tell you the truth, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, but they didn't see it. And they longed to hear what you hear, but they didn't hear it.
40Mt 13:18 "Now listen to the explanation of the parable about the farmer planting seeds.
40Mt 13:19 The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message about the Kingdom and don't understand it. Then the evil one comes and snatches away the seed that was planted in their hearts.
40Mt 13:20 The seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
40Mt 13:21 But since they don't have deep roots, they don't last long. They fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing God's word.
40Mt 13:22 The seed that fell among the thorns represents those who hear God's word, but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life and the lure of wealth, so no fruit is produced.
40Mt 13:23 The seed that fell on good soil represents those who truly hear and understand God's word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!"
40Mt 13:24 Here is another story Jesus told£∫ "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a farmer who planted good seed in his field.
40Mt 13:25 But that night as the workers slept, his enemy came and planted weeds among the wheat, then slipped away.
40Mt 13:26 When the crop began to grow and produce grain, the weeds also grew.
40Mt 13:27 "The farmer's workers went to him and said, `Sir, the field where you planted that good seed is full of weeds! Where did they come from?'
40Mt 13:28 "`An enemy has done this!' the farmer exclaimed. "`Should we pull out the weeds?' they asked.
40Mt 13:29 "`No,' he replied, `you'll uproot the wheat if you do.
40Mt 13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest. Then I will tell the harvesters to sort out the weeds, tie them into bundles, and burn them, and to put the wheat in the barn.'"
40Mt 13:31 Here is another illustration Jesus used£∫ "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a mustard seed planted in a field.
40Mt 13:32 It is the smallest of all seeds, but it becomes the largest of garden plants; it grows into a tree, and birds come and make nests in its branches."
40Mt 13:33 Jesus also used this illustration£∫ "The Kingdom of Heaven is like the yeast a woman used in making bread. Even though she put only a little yeast in three measures of flour, it permeated every part of the dough."
40Mt 13:34 Jesus always used stories and illustrations like these when speaking to the crowds. In fact, he never spoke to them without using such parables.
40Mt 13:35 This fulfilled what God had spoken through the prophet£∫ "I will speak to you in parables. I will explain things hidden since the creation of the world®Á." / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include of the world. Ps 78.2
40Mt 13:36 Then, leaving the crowds outside, Jesus went into the house. His disciples said, "Please explain to us the story of the weeds in the field."
40Mt 13:37 Jesus replied, "The Son of Man®Á is the farmer who plants the good seed. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
40Mt 13:38 The field is the world, and the good seed represents the people of the Kingdom. The weeds are the people who belong to the evil one.
40Mt 13:39 The enemy who planted the weeds among the wheat is the devil. The harvest is the end of the world®Á, and the harvesters are the angels. / ®ÁOr the age; also in 13.40, 49
40Mt 13:40 "Just as the weeds are sorted out and burned in the fire, so it will be at the end of the world.
40Mt 13:41 The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will remove from his Kingdom everything that causes sin and all who do evil.
40Mt 13:42 And the angels will throw them into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40Mt 13:43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father's Kingdom. Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!
40Mt 13:44 "The Kingdom of Heaven is like a treasure that a man discovered hidden in a field. In his excitement, he hid it again and sold everything he owned to get enough money to buy the field.
40Mt 13:45 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a merchant on the lookout for choice pearls.
40Mt 13:46 When he discovered a pearl of great value, he sold everything he owned and bought it!
40Mt 13:47 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven is like a fishing net that was thrown into the water and caught fish of every kind.
40Mt 13:48 When the net was full, they dragged it up onto the shore, sat down, and sorted the good fish into crates, but threw the bad ones away.
40Mt 13:49 That is the way it will be at the end of the world. The angels will come and separate the wicked people from the righteous,
40Mt 13:50 throwing the wicked into the fiery furnace, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40Mt 13:51 Do you understand all these things?" "Yes," they said, "we do."
40Mt 13:52 Then he added, "Every teacher of religious law who becomes a disciple in the Kingdom of Heaven is like a homeowner who brings from his storeroom new gems of truth as well as old."
40Mt 13:53 When Jesus had finished telling these stories and illustrations, he left that part of the country.
40Mt 13:54 He returned to Nazareth, his hometown. When he taught there in the synagogue, everyone was amazed and said, "Where does he get this wisdom and the power to do miracles?"
40Mt 13:55 Then they scoffed, "He's just the carpenter's son, and we know Mary, his mother, and his brothers - James, Joseph®Á, Simon, and Judas. / ®ÁOther manuscripts read Joses; still others read John
40Mt 13:56 All his sisters live right here among us. Where did he learn all these things?"
40Mt 13:57 And they were deeply offended and refused to believe in him. Then Jesus told them, "A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his own family."
40Mt 13:58 And so he did only a few miracles there because of their unbelief.
40Mt 14:1 When Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee®Á, heard about Jesus, / ®ÁGreek Herod the tetrarch. Herod Antipas was a son of King Herod and was ruler over Galilee
40Mt 14:2 he said to his advisers, "This must be John the Baptist raised from the dead! That is why he can do such miracles."
40Mt 14:3 For Herod had arrested and imprisoned John as a favor to his wife Herodias ®Á. / ®Áthe former wife of Herod's brother Philip
40Mt 14:4 John had been telling Herod, "It is against God's law for you to marry her."
40Mt 14:5 Herod wanted to kill John, but he was afraid of a riot, because all the people believed John was a prophet.
40Mt 14:6 But at a birthday party for Herod, Herodias's daughter performed a dance that greatly pleased him,
40Mt 14:7 so he promised with a vow to give her anything she wanted.
40Mt 14:8 At her mother's urging, the girl said, "I want the head of John the Baptist on a tray!"
40Mt 14:9 Then the king regretted what he had said; but because of the vow he had made in front of his guests, he issued the necessary orders.
40Mt 14:10 So John was beheaded in the prison,
40Mt 14:11 and his head was brought on a tray and given to the girl, who took it to her mother.
40Mt 14:12 Later, John's disciples came for his body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus what had happened.
40Mt 14:13 As soon as Jesus heard the news, he left in a boat to a remote area to be alone. But the crowds heard where he was headed and followed on foot from many towns.
40Mt 14:14 Jesus saw the huge crowd as he stepped from the boat, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick.
40Mt 14:15 That evening the disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late. Send the crowds away so they can go to the villages and buy food for themselves."
40Mt 14:16 But Jesus said, "That isn't necessary - you feed them."
40Mt 14:17 "But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish!" they answered.
40Mt 14:18 "Bring them here," he said.
40Mt 14:19 Then he told the people to sit down on the grass. Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, looked up toward heaven, and blessed them. Then, breaking the loaves into pieces, he gave the bread to the disciples, who distributed it to the people.
40Mt 14:20 They all ate as much as they wanted, and afterward, the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftovers.
40Mt 14:21 About 5,000 men were fed that day, in addition to all the women and children!
40Mt 14:22 Immediately after this, Jesus insisted that his disciples get back into the boat and cross to the other side of the lake, while he sent the people home.
40Mt 14:23 After sending them home, he went up into the hills by himself to pray. Night fell while he was there alone.
40Mt 14:24 Meanwhile, the disciples were in trouble far away from land, for a strong wind had risen, and they were fighting heavy waves.
40Mt 14:25 About three o'clock in the morning®Á Jesus came toward them, walking on the water. / ®ÁGreek In the fourth watch of the night
40Mt 14:26 When the disciples saw him walking on the water, they were terrified. In their fear, they cried out, "It's a ghost!"
40Mt 14:27 But Jesus spoke to them at once. "Don't be afraid," he said. "Take courage. I am here!®Á" / ®ÁOr The `I AM' is here; Greek reads I am. See Exod 3.14
40Mt 14:28 Then Peter called to him, "Lord, if it's really you, tell me to come to you, walking on the water."
40Mt 14:29 "Yes, come," Jesus said. So Peter went over the side of the boat and walked on the water toward Jesus.
40Mt 14:30 But when he saw the strong®Á wind and the waves, he was terrified and began to sink. "Save me, Lord!" he shouted. / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include strong
40Mt 14:31 Jesus immediately reached out and grabbed him. "You have so little faith," Jesus said. "Why did you doubt me?"
40Mt 14:32 When they climbed back into the boat, the wind stopped.
40Mt 14:33 Then the disciples worshiped him. "You really are the Son of God!" they exclaimed.
40Mt 14:34 After they had crossed the lake, they landed at Gennesaret.
40Mt 14:35 When the people recognized Jesus, the news of his arrival spread quickly throughout the whole area, and soon people were bringing all their sick to be healed.
40Mt 14:36 They begged him to let the sick touch at least the fringe of his robe, and all who touched him were healed.
40Mt 15:1 Some Pharisees and teachers of religious law now arrived from Jerusalem to see Jesus. They asked him,
40Mt 15:2 "Why do your disciples disobey our age-old tradition? For they ignore our tradition of ceremonial hand washing before they eat."
40Mt 15:3 Jesus replied, "And why do you, by your traditions, violate the direct commandments of God?
40Mt 15:4 For instance, God says, `Honor your father and mother,'®Á and `Anyone who speaks disrespectfully of father or mother must be put to death.'®Ë / ®ÁExod 20.12; Deut 5.16 ®ËExod 21.17 [Greek version]; Lev 20.9 (Greek version)
40Mt 15:5 But you say it is all right for people to say to their parents, `Sorry, I can't help you. For I have vowed to give to God what I would have given to you.'
40Mt 15:6 In this way, you say they don't need to honor their parents®Á. And so you cancel the word of God for the sake of your own tradition. / ®ÁGreek their father; other manuscripts read their father or their mother
40Mt 15:7 You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, for he wrote,
40Mt 15:8 `These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
40Mt 15:9 Their worship is a farce, for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God.'®Á" / ®ÁIsa 29.13 (Greek version)
40Mt 15:10 Then Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear. "Listen," he said, "and try to understand.
40Mt 15:11 It's not what goes into your mouth that defiles you; you are defiled by the words that come out of your mouth."
40Mt 15:12 Then the disciples came to him and asked, "Do you realize you offended the Pharisees by what you just said?"
40Mt 15:13 Jesus replied, "Every plant not planted by my heavenly Father will be uprooted,
40Mt 15:14 so ignore them. They are blind guides leading the blind, and if one blind person guides another, they will both fall into a ditch."
40Mt 15:15 Then Peter said to Jesus, "Explain to us the parable that says people aren't defiled by what they eat."
40Mt 15:16 "Don't you understand yet?" Jesus asked.
40Mt 15:17 "Anything you eat passes through the stomach and then goes into the sewer.
40Mt 15:18 But the words you speak come from the heart - that's what defiles you.
40Mt 15:19 For from the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, all sexual immorality, theft, lying, and slander.
40Mt 15:20 These are what defile you. Eating with unwashed hands will never defile you."
40Mt 15:21 Then Jesus left Galilee and went north to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
40Mt 15:22 A Gentile®Á woman who lived there came to him, pleading, "Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David! For my daughter is possessed by a demon that torments her severely." / ®ÁGreek Canaanite
40Mt 15:23 But Jesus gave her no reply, not even a word. Then his disciples urged him to send her away. "Tell her to go away," they said. "She is bothering us with all her begging."
40Mt 15:24 Then Jesus said to the woman, "I was sent only to help God's lost sheep - the people of Israel."
40Mt 15:25 But she came and worshiped him, pleading again, "Lord, help me!"
40Mt 15:26 Jesus responded, "It isn't right to take food from the children and throw it to the dogs."
40Mt 15:27 She replied, "That's true, Lord, but even dogs are allowed to eat the scraps that fall beneath their masters' table."
40Mt 15:28 "Dear woman," Jesus said to her, "your faith is great. Your request is granted." And her daughter was instantly healed.
40Mt 15:29 Jesus returned to the Sea of Galilee and climbed a hill and sat down.
40Mt 15:30 A vast crowd brought to him people who were lame, blind, crippled, those who couldn't speak, and many others. They laid them before Jesus, and he healed them all.
40Mt 15:31 The crowd was amazed! Those who hadn't been able to speak were talking, the crippled were made well, the lame were walking, and the blind could see again! And they praised the God of Israel.
40Mt 15:32 Then Jesus called his disciples and told them, "I feel sorry for these people. They have been here with me for three days, and they have nothing left to eat. I don't want to send them away hungry, or they will faint along the way."
40Mt 15:33 The disciples replied, "Where would we get enough food here in the wilderness for such a huge crowd?"
40Mt 15:34 Jesus asked, "How much bread do you have?" They replied, "Seven loaves, and a few small fish."
40Mt 15:35 So Jesus told all the people to sit down on the ground.
40Mt 15:36 Then he took the seven loaves and the fish, thanked God for them, and broke them into pieces. He gave them to the disciples, who distributed the food to the crowd.
40Mt 15:37 They all ate as much as they wanted. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven large baskets of leftover food.
40Mt 15:38 There were 4,000 men who were fed that day, in addition to all the women and children.
40Mt 15:39 Then Jesus sent the people home, and he got into a boat and crossed over to the region of Magadan.
40Mt 16:1 One day the Pharisees and Sadducees came to test Jesus, demanding that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority.
40Mt 16:2 He replied, "You know the saying, `Red sky at night means fair weather tomorrow;
40Mt 16:3 red sky in the morning means foul weather all day.' You know how to interpret the weather signs in the sky, but you don't know how to interpret the signs of the times!®Á / ®ÁSeveral manuscripts do not include any of the words in 16.2-3 after He replied
40Mt 16:4 Only an evil, adulterous generation would demand a miraculous sign, but the only sign I will give them is the sign of the prophet Jonah®Á." Then Jesus left them and went away. / ®ÁGreek the sign of Jonah
40Mt 16:5 Later, after they crossed to the other side of the lake, the disciples discovered they had forgotten to bring any bread.
40Mt 16:6 "Watch out!" Jesus warned them. "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees."
40Mt 16:7 At this they began to argue with each other because they hadn't brought any bread.
40Mt 16:8 Jesus knew what they were saying, so he said, "You have so little faith! Why are you arguing with each other about having no bread?
40Mt 16:9 Don't you understand even yet? Don't you remember the 5,000 I fed with five loaves, and the baskets of leftovers you picked up?
40Mt 16:10 Or the 4,000 I fed with seven loaves, and the large baskets of leftovers you picked up?
40Mt 16:11 Why can't you understand that I'm not talking about bread? So again I say, `Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees.'"
40Mt 16:12 Then at last they understood that he wasn't speaking about the yeast in bread, but about the deceptive teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
40Mt 16:13 When Jesus came to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"®Á / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
40Mt 16:14 "Well," they replied, "some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say Jeremiah or one of the other prophets."
40Mt 16:15 Then he asked them, "But who do you say I am?"
40Mt 16:16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah®Á, the Son of the living God." / ®ÁOr the Christ. Messiah [a Hebrew term] and Christ [a Greek term] both mean "the anointed one."
40Mt 16:17 Jesus replied, "You are blessed, Simon son of John®Á, because my Father in heaven has revealed this to you. You did not learn this from any human being. / ®ÁGreek Simon bar-Jonah; see John 1.42; 21.15-17
40Mt 16:18 Now I say to you that you are Peter (which means `rock')®Á, and upon this rock I will build my church, and all the powers of hell®Ë will not conquer it. / ®ÁGreek that you are Peter ®ËGreek and the gates of Hades
40Mt 16:19 And I will give you the keys of the Kingdom of Heaven. Whatever you forbid®Á on earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit®Ë on earth will be permitted in heaven." / ®ÁOr bind, or lock ®ËOr loose, or open
40Mt 16:20 Then he sternly warned the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
40Mt 16:21 From then on Jesus®Á began to tell his disciples plainly that it was necessary for him to go to Jerusalem, and that he would suffer many terrible things at the hands of the elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of religious law. He would be killed, but on the third day he would be raised from the dead. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read Jesus the Messiah
40Mt 16:22 But Peter took him aside and began to reprimand him®Á for saying such things. "Heaven forbid, Lord," he said. "This will never happen to you!" / ®ÁOr began to correct him
40Mt 16:23 Jesus turned to Peter and said, "Get away from me, Satan! You are a dangerous trap to me. You are seeing things merely from a human point of view, not from God's."
40Mt 16:24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If any of you wants to be my follower, you must turn from your selfish ways, take up your cross, and follow me.
40Mt 16:25 If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it.
40Mt 16:26 And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?®Á Is anything worth more than your soul? / ®ÁOr your self?
40Mt 16:27 For the Son of Man will come with his angels in the glory of his Father and will judge all people according to their deeds.
40Mt 16:28 And I tell you the truth, some standing here right now will not die before they see the Son of Man coming in his Kingdom."
40Mt 17:1 Six days later Jesus took Peter and the two brothers, James and John, and led them up a high mountain to be alone.
40Mt 17:2 As the men watched, Jesus' appearance was transformed so that his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
40Mt 17:3 Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared and began talking with Jesus.
40Mt 17:4 Peter exclaimed, "Lord, it's wonderful for us to be here! If you want, I'll make three shelters as memorials®Á - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." / ®ÁGreek three tabernacles
40Mt 17:5 But even as he spoke, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy. Listen to him."
40Mt 17:6 The disciples were terrified and fell face down on the ground.
40Mt 17:7 Then Jesus came over and touched them. "Get up," he said. "Don't be afraid."
40Mt 17:8 And when they looked up, Moses and Elijah were gone, and they saw only Jesus.
40Mt 17:9 As they went back down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, "Don't tell anyone what you have seen until the Son of Man®Á has been raised from the dead." / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
40Mt 17:10 Then his disciples asked him, "Why do the teachers of religious law insist that Elijah must return before the Messiah comes?®Á" / ®ÁGreek that Elijah must come first?
40Mt 17:11 Jesus replied, "Elijah is indeed coming first to get everything ready.
40Mt 17:12 But I tell you, Elijah has already come, but he wasn't recognized, and they chose to abuse him. And in the same way they will also make the Son of Man suffer."
40Mt 17:13 Then the disciples realized he was talking about John the Baptist.
40Mt 17:14 At the foot of the mountain, a large crowd was waiting for them. A man came and knelt before Jesus and said,
40Mt 17:15 "Lord, have mercy on my son. He has seizures and suffers terribly. He often falls into the fire or into the water.
40Mt 17:16 So I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't heal him."
40Mt 17:17 Jesus said, "You faithless and corrupt people! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy here to me."
40Mt 17:18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon in the boy, and it left him. From that moment the boy was well.
40Mt 17:19 Afterward the disciples asked Jesus privately, "Why couldn't we cast out that demon?"
40Mt 17:20 "You don't have enough faith," Jesus told them. "I tell you the truth, if you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mountain, `Move from here to there,' and it would move. Nothing would be impossible®Á."
40Mt 17:21 ®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts add verse 21, But this kind of demon won't leave except by prayer and fasting. Compare Mark 9.29
40Mt 17:22 After they gathered again in Galilee, Jesus told them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies.
40Mt 17:23 He will be killed, but on the third day he will be raised from the dead." And the disciples were filled with grief.
40Mt 17:24 On their arrival in Capernaum, the collectors of the Temple tax®Á came to Peter and asked him, "Doesn't your teacher pay the Temple tax?" / ®ÁGreek the two-drachma [tax]; also in 17.24b. See Exod 30.13-16; Neh 10.32-33
40Mt 17:25 "Yes, he does," Peter replied. Then he went into the house. But before he had a chance to speak, Jesus asked him, "What do you think, Peter®Á? Do kings tax their own people or the people they have conquered?®Ë" / ®ÁGreek Simon ®ËGreek their sons or others?
40Mt 17:26 "They tax the people they have conquered," Peter replied. "Well, then," Jesus said, "the citizens are free!
40Mt 17:27 However, we don't want to offend them, so go down to the lake and throw in a line. Open the mouth of the first fish you catch, and you will find a large silver coin®Á. Take it and pay the tax for both of us." / ®ÁGreek a stater [a Greek coin equivalent to four drachmas]
40Mt 18:1 About that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who is greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven?"
40Mt 18:2 Jesus called a little child to him and put the child among them.
40Mt 18:3 Then he said, "I tell you the truth, unless you turn from your sins and become like little children, you will never get into the Kingdom of Heaven.
40Mt 18:4 So anyone who becomes as humble as this little child is the greatest in the Kingdom of Heaven.
40Mt 18:5 "And anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf®Á is welcoming me. / ®ÁGreek in my name
40Mt 18:6 But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin, it would be better for you to have a large millstone tied around your neck and be drowned in the depths of the sea.
40Mt 18:7 "What sorrow awaits the world, because it tempts people to sin. Temptations are inevitable, but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting.
40Mt 18:8 So if your hand or foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It's better to enter eternal life with only one hand or one foot than to be thrown into eternal fire with both of your hands and feet.
40Mt 18:9 And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out and throw it away. It's better to enter eternal life with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into the fire of hell®Á. / ®ÁGreek the Gehenna of fire
40Mt 18:10 "Beware that you don't look down on any of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels are always in the presence of my heavenly Father.
40Mt 18:11 ®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts add verse 11, And the Son of Man came to save those who are lost. Compare Luke 19.10
40Mt 18:12 "If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them wanders away, what will he do? Won't he leave the ninety-nine others on the hills and go out to search for the one that is lost?
40Mt 18:13 And if he finds it, I tell you the truth, he will rejoice over it more than over the ninety-nine that didn't wander away!
40Mt 18:14 In the same way, it is not my heavenly Father's will that even one of these little ones should perish.
40Mt 18:15 "If another believer®Á sins against you®Ë, go privately and point out the offense. If the other person listens and confesses it, you have won that person back. / ®ÁGreek If your brother ®ËSome manuscripts do not include against you
40Mt 18:16 But if you are unsuccessful, take one or two others with you and go back again, so that everything you say may be confirmed by two or three witnesses.
40Mt 18:17 If the person still refuses to listen, take your case to the church. Then if he or she won't accept the church's decision, treat that person as a pagan or a corrupt tax collector.
40Mt 18:18 "I tell you the truth, whatever you forbid®Á on earth will be forbidden in heaven, and whatever you permit®Ë on earth will be permitted in heaven. / ®ÁOr bind, or lock ®ËOr loose, or open
40Mt 18:19 "I also tell you this£∫ If two of you agree here on earth concerning anything you ask, my Father in heaven will do it for you.
40Mt 18:20 For where two or three gather together as my followers®Á, I am there among them." / ®ÁGreek gather together in my name
40Mt 18:21 Then Peter came to him and asked, "Lord, how often should I forgive someone®Á who sins against me? Seven times?" / ®ÁGreek my brother
40Mt 18:22 "No, not seven times," Jesus replied, "but seventy times seven!®Á / ®ÁOr seventy-seven times
40Mt 18:23 "Therefore, the Kingdom of Heaven can be compared to a king who decided to bring his accounts up to date with servants who had borrowed money from him.
40Mt 18:24 In the process, one of his debtors was brought in who owed him millions of dollars®Á. / ®ÁGreek 10,000 talents [375 tons or 340 metric tons of silver]
40Mt 18:25 He couldn't pay, so his master ordered that he be sold - along with his wife, his children, and everything he owned - to pay the debt.
40Mt 18:26 "But the man fell down before his master and begged him, `Please, be patient with me, and I will pay it all.'
40Mt 18:27 Then his master was filled with pity for him, and he released him and forgave his debt.
40Mt 18:28 "But when the man left the king, he went to a fellow servant who owed him a few thousand dollars®Á. He grabbed him by the throat and demanded instant payment. / ®ÁGreek 100 denarii. A denarius was equivalent to a laborer's full day's wage
40Mt 18:29 "His fellow servant fell down before him and begged for a little more time. `Be patient with me, and I will pay it,' he pleaded.
40Mt 18:30 But his creditor wouldn't wait. He had the man arrested and put in prison until the debt could be paid in full.
40Mt 18:31 "When some of the other servants saw this, they were very upset. They went to the king and told him everything that had happened.
40Mt 18:32 Then the king called in the man he had forgiven and said, `You evil servant! I forgave you that tremendous debt because you pleaded with me.
40Mt 18:33 Shouldn't you have mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?'
40Mt 18:34 Then the angry king sent the man to prison to be tortured until he had paid his entire debt.
40Mt 18:35 "That's what my heavenly Father will do to you if you refuse to forgive your brothers and sisters®Á from your heart." / ®ÁGreek your brother
40Mt 19:1 When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went down to the region of Judea east of the Jordan River.
40Mt 19:2 Large crowds followed him there, and he healed their sick.
40Mt 19:3 Some Pharisees came and tried to trap him with this question£∫ "Should a man be allowed to divorce his wife for just any reason?"
40Mt 19:4 "Haven't you read the Scriptures?" Jesus replied. "They record that from the beginning `God made them male and female.'®Á / ®ÁGen 1.27; 5.2
40Mt 19:5 And he said, `This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one.'®Á / ®ÁGen 2.24
40Mt 19:6 Since they are no longer two but one, let no one split apart what God has joined together."
40Mt 19:7 "Then why did Moses say in the law that a man could give his wife a written notice of divorce and send her away?"®Á they asked. / ®ÁSee Deut 24.1
40Mt 19:8 Jesus replied, "Moses permitted divorce only as a concession to your hard hearts, but it was not what God had originally intended.
40Mt 19:9 And I tell you this, whoever divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery - unless his wife has been unfaithful®Á." / ®ÁSome manuscripts add And anyone who marries a divorced woman commits adultery. Compare Matt 5.32
40Mt 19:10 Jesus' disciples then said to him, "If this is the case, it is better not to marry!"
40Mt 19:11 "Not everyone can accept this statement," Jesus said. "Only those whom God helps.
40Mt 19:12 Some are born as eunuchs, some have been made eunuchs by others, and some choose not to marry®Á for the sake of the Kingdom of Heaven. Let anyone accept this who can." / ®ÁGreek and some make themselves eunuchs
40Mt 19:13 One day some parents brought their children to Jesus so he could lay his hands on them and pray for them. But the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him.
40Mt 19:14 But Jesus said, "Let the children come to me. Don't stop them! For the Kingdom of Heaven belongs to those who are like these children."
40Mt 19:15 And he placed his hands on their heads and blessed them before he left.
40Mt 19:16 Someone came to Jesus with this question£∫ "Teacher®Á, what good deed must I do to have eternal life?" / ®ÁSome manuscripts read Good Teacher
40Mt 19:17 "Why ask me about what is good?" Jesus replied. "There is only One who is good. But to answer your question - if you want to receive eternal life, keep®Á the commandments." / ®ÁSome manuscripts read continue to keep
40Mt 19:18 "Which ones?" the man asked. And Jesus replied£∫ "`You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely.
40Mt 19:19 Honor your father and mother. Love your neighbor as yourself.'®Á" / ®ÁExod 20.12-16; Deut 5.16-20; Lev 19.18
40Mt 19:20 "I've obeyed all these commandments," the young man replied. "What else must I do?"
40Mt 19:21 Jesus told him, "If you want to be perfect, go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
40Mt 19:22 But when the young man heard this, he went away sad, for he had many possessions.
40Mt 19:23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you the truth, it is very hard for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of Heaven.
40Mt 19:24 I'll say it again - it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!"
40Mt 19:25 The disciples were astounded. "Then who in the world can be saved?" they asked.
40Mt 19:26 Jesus looked at them intently and said, "Humanly speaking, it is impossible. But with God everything is possible."
40Mt 19:27 Then Peter said to him, "We've given up everything to follow you. What will we get?"
40Mt 19:28 Jesus replied, "I assure you that when the world is made new®Á and the Son of Man®Ë sits upon his glorious throne, you who have been my followers will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. / ®ÁOr in the regeneration ®Ë"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
40Mt 19:29 And everyone who has given up houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or property, for my sake, will receive a hundred times as much in return and will inherit eternal life.
40Mt 19:30 But many who are the greatest now will be least important then, and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then®Á. / ®ÁGreek But many who are first will be last; and the last, first
40Mt 20:1 "For the Kingdom of Heaven is like the landowner who went out early one morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
40Mt 20:2 He agreed to pay the normal daily wage®Á and sent them out to work. / ®ÁGreek a denarius, the payment for a full day's labor; similarly in 20.9, 10, 13
40Mt 20:3 "At nine o'clock in the morning he was passing through the marketplace and saw some people standing around doing nothing.
40Mt 20:4 So he hired them, telling them he would pay them whatever was right at the end of the day.
40Mt 20:5 So they went to work in the vineyard. At noon and again at three o'clock he did the same thing.
40Mt 20:6 "At five o'clock that afternoon he was in town again and saw some more people standing around. He asked them, `Why haven't you been working today?'
40Mt 20:7 "They replied, `Because no one hired us.' "The landowner told them, `Then go out and join the others in my vineyard.'
40Mt 20:8 "That evening he told the foreman to call the workers in and pay them, beginning with the last workers first.
40Mt 20:9 When those hired at five o'clock were paid, each received a full day's wage.
40Mt 20:10 When those hired first came to get their pay, they assumed they would receive more. But they, too, were paid a day's wage.
40Mt 20:11 When they received their pay, they protested to the owner,
40Mt 20:12 `Those people worked only one hour, and yet you've paid them just as much as you paid us who worked all day in the scorching heat.'
40Mt 20:13 "He answered one of them, `Friend, I haven't been unfair! Didn't you agree to work all day for the usual wage?
40Mt 20:14 Take your money and go. I wanted to pay this last worker the same as you.
40Mt 20:15 Is it against the law for me to do what I want with my money? Should you be jealous because I am kind to others?'
40Mt 20:16 "So those who are last now will be first then, and those who are first will be last."
40Mt 20:17 As Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside privately and told them what was going to happen to him.
40Mt 20:18 "Listen," he said, "we're going up to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man®Á will be betrayed to the leading priests and the teachers of religious law. They will sentence him to die. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
40Mt 20:19 Then they will hand him over to the Romans®Á to be mocked, flogged with a whip, and crucified. But on the third day he will be raised from the dead." / ®ÁGreek the Gentiles
40Mt 20:20 Then the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came to Jesus with her sons. She knelt respectfully to ask a favor.
40Mt 20:21 "What is your request?" he asked. She replied, "In your Kingdom, please let my two sons sit in places of honor next to you, one on your right and the other on your left."
40Mt 20:22 But Jesus answered by saying to them, "You don't know what you are asking! Are you able to drink from the bitter cup of suffering I am about to drink?" "Oh yes," they replied, "we are able!"
40Mt 20:23 Jesus told them, "You will indeed drink from my bitter cup. But I have no right to say who will sit on my right or my left. My Father has prepared those places for the ones he has chosen."
40Mt 20:24 When the ten other disciples heard what James and John had asked, they were indignant.
40Mt 20:25 But Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people, and officials flaunt their authority over those under them.
40Mt 20:26 But among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant,
40Mt 20:27 and whoever wants to be first among you must become your slave.
40Mt 20:28 For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many."
40Mt 20:29 As Jesus and the disciples left the town of Jericho, a large crowd followed behind.
40Mt 20:30 Two blind men were sitting beside the road. When they heard that Jesus was coming that way, they began shouting, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
40Mt 20:31 "Be quiet!" the crowd yelled at them. But they only shouted louder, "Lord, Son of David, have mercy on us!"
40Mt 20:32 When Jesus heard them, he stopped and called, "What do you want me to do for you?"
40Mt 20:33 "Lord," they said, "we want to see!"
40Mt 20:34 Jesus felt sorry for them and touched their eyes. Instantly they could see! Then they followed him.
40Mt 21:1 As Jesus and the disciples approached Jerusalem, they came to the town of Bethphage on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of them on ahead.
40Mt 21:2 "Go into the village over there," he said. "As soon as you enter it, you will see a donkey tied there, with its colt beside it. Untie them and bring them to me.
40Mt 21:3 If anyone asks what you are doing, just say, `The Lord needs them,' and he will immediately let you take them."
40Mt 21:4 This took place to fulfill the prophecy that said,
40Mt 21:5 "Tell the people of Israel®Á, `Look, your King is coming to you. He is humble, riding on a donkey? riding on a donkey's colt.'"®Ë / ®ÁGreek Tell the daughter of Zion. Isa 62.11 ®ËZech 9.9
40Mt 21:6 The two disciples did as Jesus commanded.
40Mt 21:7 They brought the donkey and the colt to him and threw their garments over the colt, and he sat on it®Á. / ®ÁGreek over them, and he sat on them
40Mt 21:8 Most of the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of him, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road.
40Mt 21:9 Jesus was in the center of the procession, and the people all around him were shouting, "Praise God®Á for the Son of David! Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the LORD! Praise God in highest heaven!"®Ë / ®ÁGreek Hosanna, an exclamation of praise that literally means "save now" ®ËPss 118.25-26; 148.1
40Mt 21:10 The entire city of Jerusalem was in an uproar as he entered. "Who is this?" they asked.
40Mt 21:11 And the crowds replied, "It's Jesus, the prophet from Nazareth in Galilee."
40Mt 21:12 Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out all the people buying and selling animals for sacrifice. He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves.
40Mt 21:13 He said to them, "The Scriptures declare, `My Temple will be called a house of prayer,' but you have turned it into a den of thieves!"®Á / ®ÁIsa 56.7; Jer 7.11
40Mt 21:14 The blind and the lame came to him in the Temple, and he healed them.
40Mt 21:15 The leading priests and the teachers of religious law saw these wonderful miracles and heard even the children in the Temple shouting, "Praise God for the Son of David." But the leaders were indignant.
40Mt 21:16 They asked Jesus, "Do you hear what these children are saying?" "Yes," Jesus replied. "Haven't you ever read the Scriptures? For they say, `You have taught children and infants to give you praise.'®Á / ®ÁPs 8.2"
40Mt 21:17 Then he returned to Bethany, where he stayed overnight.
40Mt 21:18 In the morning, as Jesus was returning to Jerusalem, he was hungry,
40Mt 21:19 and he noticed a fig tree beside the road. He went over to see if there were any figs, but there were only leaves. Then he said to it, "May you never bear fruit again!" And immediately the fig tree withered up.
40Mt 21:20 The disciples were amazed when they saw this and asked, "How did the fig tree wither so quickly?"
40Mt 21:21 Then Jesus told them, "I tell you the truth, if you have faith and don't doubt, you can do things like this and much more. You can even say to this mountain, `May you be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' and it will happen.
40Mt 21:22 You can pray for anything, and if you have faith, you will receive it."
40Mt 21:23 When Jesus returned to the Temple and began teaching, the leading priests and elders came up to him. They demanded, "By what authority are you doing all these things? Who gave you the right?"
40Mt 21:24 "I'll tell you by what authority I do these things if you answer one question," Jesus replied.
40Mt 21:25 "Did John's authority to baptize come from heaven, or was it merely human?" They talked it over among themselves. "If we say it was from heaven, he will ask us why we didn't believe John.
40Mt 21:26 But if we say it was merely human, we'll be mobbed because the people believe John was a prophet."
40Mt 21:27 So they finally replied, "We don't know." And Jesus responded, "Then I won't tell you by what authority I do these things.
40Mt 21:28 "But what do you think about this? A man with two sons told the older boy, `Son, go out and work in the vineyard today.'
40Mt 21:29 The son answered, `No, I won't go,' but later he changed his mind and went anyway.
40Mt 21:30 Then the father told the other son, `You go,' and he said, `Yes, sir, I will.' But he didn't go.
40Mt 21:31 "Which of the two obeyed his father?" They replied, "The first."®Á Then Jesus explained his meaning£∫ "I tell you the truth, corrupt tax collectors and prostitutes will get into the Kingdom of God before you do. / ®ÁOther manuscripts read "The second." In still other manuscripts the first son says "Yes" but does nothing, the second son says "No" but then repents and goes, and the answer to Jesus' question is that the second son obeyed his father
40Mt 21:32 For John the Baptist came and showed you the right way to live, but you didn't believe him, while tax collectors and prostitutes did. And even when you saw this happening, you refused to believe him and repent of your sins.
40Mt 21:33 "Now listen to another story. A certain landowner planted a vineyard, built a wall around it, dug a pit for pressing out the grape juice, and built a lookout tower. Then he leased the vineyard to tenant farmers and moved to another country.
40Mt 21:34 At the time of the grape harvest, he sent his servants to collect his share of the crop.
40Mt 21:35 But the farmers grabbed his servants, beat one, killed one, and stoned another.
40Mt 21:36 So the landowner sent a larger group of his servants to collect for him, but the results were the same.
40Mt 21:37 "Finally, the owner sent his son, thinking, `Surely they will respect my son.' 
40Mt 21:38 "But when the tenant farmers saw his son coming, they said to one another, `Here comes the heir to this estate. Come on, let's kill him and get the estate for ourselves!'
40Mt 21:39 So they grabbed him, dragged him out of the vineyard, and murdered him.
40Mt 21:40 "When the owner of the vineyard returns," Jesus asked, "what do you think he will do to those farmers?"
40Mt 21:41 The religious leaders replied, "He will put the wicked men to a horrible death and lease the vineyard to others who will give him his share of the crop after each harvest."
40Mt 21:42 Then Jesus asked them, "Didn't you ever read this in the Scriptures? `The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone. This is the LORD's doing, and it is wonderful to see.'®Á / ®ÁPs 118.22-23
40Mt 21:43 I tell you, the Kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a nation that will produce the proper fruit.
40Mt 21:44 Anyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone it falls on®Á." / ®ÁThis verse is omitted in some early manuscripts. Compare Luke 20.18
40Mt 21:45 When the leading priests and Pharisees heard this parable, they realized he was telling the story against them?they were the wicked farmers.
40Mt 21:46 They wanted to arrest him, but they were afraid of the crowds, who considered Jesus to be a prophet.
40Mt 22:1 Jesus also told them other parables. He said,
40Mt 22:2 "The Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of a king who prepared a great wedding feast for his son.
40Mt 22:3 When the banquet was ready, he sent his servants to notify those who were invited. But they all refused to come!
40Mt 22:4 "So he sent other servants to tell them, `The feast has been prepared. The bulls and fattened cattle have been killed, and everything is ready. Come to the banquet!'
40Mt 22:5 But the guests he had invited ignored them and went their own way, one to his farm, another to his business.
40Mt 22:6 Others seized his messengers and insulted them and killed them.
40Mt 22:7 "The king was furious, and he sent out his army to destroy the murderers and burn their town.
40Mt 22:8 And he said to his servants, `The wedding feast is ready, and the guests I invited aren't worthy of the honor.
40Mt 22:9 Now go out to the street corners and invite everyone you see.'
40Mt 22:10 So the servants brought in everyone they could find, good and bad alike, and the banquet hall was filled with guests.
40Mt 22:11 "But when the king came in to meet the guests, he noticed a man who wasn't wearing the proper clothes for a wedding.
40Mt 22:12 `Friend,' he asked, `how is it that you are here without wedding clothes?' But the man had no reply.
40Mt 22:13 Then the king said to his aides, `Bind his hands and feet and throw him into the outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
40Mt 22:14 "For many are called, but few are chosen."
40Mt 22:15 Then the Pharisees met together to plot how to trap Jesus into saying something for which he could be arrested.
40Mt 22:16 They sent some of their disciples, along with the supporters of Herod, to meet with him. "Teacher," they said, "we know how honest you are. You teach the way of God truthfully. You are impartial and don't play favorites.
40Mt 22:17 Now tell us what you think about this£∫ Is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
40Mt 22:18 But Jesus knew their evil motives. "You hypocrites!" he said. "Why are you trying to trap me?
40Mt 22:19 Here, show me the coin used for the tax." When they handed him a Roman coin®Á, / ®ÁGreek a denarius
40Mt 22:20 he asked, "Whose picture and title are stamped on it?"
40Mt 22:21 "Caesar's," they replied. "Well, then," he said, "give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God."
40Mt 22:22 His reply amazed them, and they went away. 
40Mt 22:23 That same day Jesus was approached by some Sadducees?religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead. They posed this question.
40Mt 22:24 "Teacher, Moses said, `If a man dies without children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother's name.'®Á / ®ÁDeut 25.5-6
40Mt 22:25 Well, suppose there were seven brothers. The oldest one married and then died without children, so his brother married the widow.
40Mt 22:26 But the second brother also died, and the third brother married her. This continued with all seven of them.
40Mt 22:27 Last of all, the woman also died.
40Mt 22:28 So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection? For all seven were married to her."
40Mt 22:29 Jesus replied, "Your mistake is that you don't know the Scriptures, and you don't know the power of God.
40Mt 22:30 For when the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. In this respect they will be like the angels in heaven.
40Mt 22:31 "But now, as to whether there will be a resurrection of the dead?haven't you ever read about this in the Scriptures? Long after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had died, God said®Á, / ®ÁGreek read about this? God said
40Mt 22:32 `I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'®Á So he is the God of the living, not the dead." / ®ÁExod 3.6
40Mt 22:33 When the crowds heard him, they were astounded at his teaching.
40Mt 22:34 But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees with his reply, they met together to question him again.
40Mt 22:35 One of them, an expert in religious law, tried to trap him with this question.
40Mt 22:36 "Teacher, which is the most important commandment in the law of Moses?"
40Mt 22:37 Jesus replied, "`You must love the LORD your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your mind.'®Á / ®ÁDeut 6.5
40Mt 22:38 This is the first and greatest commandment.
40Mt 22:39 A second is equally important£∫ `Love your neighbor as yourself.'®Á / ®ÁLev 19.18
40Mt 22:40 The entire law and all the demands of the prophets are based on these two commandments."
40Mt 22:41 Then, surrounded by the Pharisees, Jesus asked them a question.
40Mt 22:42 "What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" They replied, "He is the son of David."
40Mt 22:43 Jesus responded, "Then why does David, speaking under the inspiration of the Spirit, call the Messiah `my Lord'? For David said,
40Mt 22:44 `The LORD said to my Lord, Sit in the place of honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies beneath your feet.'®Á / ®ÁPs 110.1
40Mt 22:45 Since David called the Messiah `my Lord,' how can the Messiah be his son?"
40Mt 22:46 No one could answer him. And after that, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
40Mt 23:1 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples,
40Mt 23:2 "The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees are the official interpreters of the law of Moses®Á. / ®ÁGreek and the Pharisees sit in the seat of Moses
40Mt 23:3 So practice and obey whatever they tell you, but don't follow their example. For they don't practice what they teach.
40Mt 23:4 They crush people with unbearable religious demands and never lift a finger to ease the burden.
40Mt 23:5 "Everything they do is for show. On their arms they wear extra wide prayer boxes with Scripture verses inside, and they wear robes with extra long tassels®Á. / ®ÁGreek They enlarge their phylacteries and lengthen their tassels
40Mt 23:6 And they love to sit at the head table at banquets and in the seats of honor in the synagogues.
40Mt 23:7 They love to receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces, and to be called `Rabbi.'®Á / ®ÁRabbi, from Aramaic, means "master" or "teacher"
40Mt 23:8 "Don't let anyone call you `Rabbi,' for you have only one teacher, and all of you are equal as brothers and sisters®Á. / ®ÁGreek brothers
40Mt 23:9 And don't address anyone here on earth as `Father,' for only God in heaven is your spiritual Father.
40Mt 23:10 And don't let anyone call you `Teacher,' for you have only one teacher, the Messiah.
40Mt 23:11 The greatest among you must be a servant.
40Mt 23:12 But those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted.
40Mt 23:13 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you shut the door of the Kingdom of Heaven in people's faces. You won't go in yourselves, and you don't let others enter either.
40Mt 23:14 ®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts add verse 14, What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! You shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this, you will be severely punished. Compare Mark 12.40 and Luke 20.47
40Mt 23:15 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you cross land and sea to make one convert, and then you turn that person into twice the child of hell®Á you yourselves are! / ®ÁGreek of Gehenna; also in 23.33
40Mt 23:16 "Blind guides! What sorrow awaits you! For you say that it means nothing to swear `by God's Temple,' but that it is binding to swear `by the gold in the Temple.'
40Mt 23:17 Blind fools! Which is more important?the gold or the Temple that makes the gold sacred?
40Mt 23:18 And you say that to swear `by the altar' is not binding, but to swear `by the gifts on the altar' is binding.
40Mt 23:19 How blind! For which is more important?the gift on the altar or the altar that makes the gift sacred?
40Mt 23:20 When you swear `by the altar,' you are swearing by it and by everything on it.
40Mt 23:21 And when you swear `by the Temple,' you are swearing by it and by God, who lives in it.
40Mt 23:22 And when you swear `by heaven,' you are swearing by the throne of God and by God, who sits on the throne.
40Mt 23:23 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are careful to tithe even the tiniest income from your herb gardens®Á, but you ignore the more important aspects of the law?justice, mercy, and faith. You should tithe, yes, but do not neglect the more important things. / ®ÁGreek tithe the mint, the dill, and the cumin

40Mt 23:25 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are filthy?full of greed and self-indulgence!
40Mt 23:26 You blind Pharisee! First wash the inside of the cup and the dish®Á, and then the outside will become clean, too. / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include and the dish
40Mt 23:27 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs?beautiful on the outside but filled on the inside with dead people's bones and all sorts of impurity.
40Mt 23:28 Outwardly you look like righteous people, but inwardly your hearts are filled with hypocrisy and lawlessness.
40Mt 23:29 "What sorrow awaits you teachers of religious law and you Pharisees. Hypocrites! For you build tombs for the prophets your ancestors killed, and you decorate the monuments of the godly people your ancestors destroyed.
40Mt 23:30 Then you say, `If we had lived in the days of our ancestors, we would never have joined them in killing the prophets.'
40Mt 23:31 "But in saying that, you testify against yourselves that you are indeed the descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
40Mt 23:32 Go ahead and finish what your ancestors started.
40Mt 23:33 Snakes! Sons of vipers! How will you escape the judgment of hell?
40Mt 23:34 "Therefore, I am sending you prophets and wise men and teachers of religious law. But you will kill some by crucifixion, and you will flog others with whips in your synagogues, chasing them from city to city.
40Mt 23:35 As a result, you will be held responsible for the murder of all godly people of all time?from the murder of righteous Abel to the murder of Zechariah son of Barachiah, whom you killed in the Temple between the sanctuary and the altar.
40Mt 23:36 I tell you the truth, this judgment will fall on this very generation.
40Mt 23:37 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones God's messengers! How often I have wanted to gather your children together as a hen protects her chicks beneath her wings, but you wouldn't let me.
40Mt 23:38 And now, look, your house is abandoned and desolate®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include and desolate
40Mt 23:39 For I tell you this, you will never see me again until you say, `Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the LORD!'®Á" / ®ÁPs 118.26
40Mt 24:1 As Jesus was leaving the Temple grounds, his disciples pointed out to him the various Temple buildings.
40Mt 24:2 But he responded, "Do you see all these buildings? I tell you the truth, they will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!"
40Mt 24:3 Later, Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives. His disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will all this happen? What sign will signal your return and the end of the world?®Á" / ®ÁOr the age?
40Mt 24:4 Jesus told them, "Don't let anyone mislead you,
40Mt 24:5 for many will come in my name, claiming, `I am the Messiah.' They will deceive many.
40Mt 24:6 And you will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don't panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won't follow immediately.
40Mt 24:7 Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in many parts of the world.
40Mt 24:8 But all this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.
40Mt 24:9 "Then you will be arrested, persecuted, and killed. You will be hated all over the world because you are my followers®Á. / ®ÁGreek on account of my name
40Mt 24:10 And many will turn away from me and betray and hate each other.
40Mt 24:11 And many false prophets will appear and will deceive many people.
40Mt 24:12 Sin will be rampant everywhere, and the love of many will grow cold.
40Mt 24:13 But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
40Mt 24:14 And the Good News about the Kingdom will be preached throughout the whole world, so that all nations®Á will hear it; and then the end will come. / ®ÁOr all peoples
40Mt 24:15 "The day is coming when you will see what Daniel the prophet spoke about?the sacrilegious object that causes desecration®Á standing in the Holy Place." (Reader, pay attention!) / ®ÁGreek the abomination of desolation. See Dan 9.27; 11.31; 12.11
40Mt 24:16 "Then those in Judea must flee to the hills.
40Mt 24:17 A person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack.
40Mt 24:18 A person out in the field must not return even to get a coat.
40Mt 24:19 How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days.
40Mt 24:20 And pray that your flight will not be in winter or on the Sabbath.
40Mt 24:21 For there will be greater anguish than at any time since the world began. And it will never be so great again.
40Mt 24:22 In fact, unless that time of calamity is shortened, not a single person will survive. But it will be shortened for the sake of God's chosen ones.
40Mt 24:23 "Then if anyone tells you, `Look, here is the Messiah,' or `There he is,' don't believe it.
40Mt 24:24 For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform great signs and wonders so as to deceive, if possible, even God's chosen ones.
40Mt 24:25 See, I have warned you about this ahead of time.
40Mt 24:26 "So if someone tells you, `Look, the Messiah is out in the desert,' don't bother to go and look. Or, `Look, he is hiding here,' don't believe it!
40Mt 24:27 For as the lightning flashes in the east and shines to the west, so it will be when the Son of Man®Á comes. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
40Mt 24:28 Just as the gathering of vultures shows there is a carcass nearby, so these signs indicate that the end is near®Á. / ®ÁGreek Wherever the carcass is, the vultures gather
40Mt 24:29 "Immediately after the anguish of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will give no light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken®Á. / ®ÁSee Isa 13.10; 34.4; Joel 2.10
40Mt 24:30 And then at last, the sign that the Son of Man is coming will appear in the heavens, and there will be deep mourning among all the peoples of the earth. And they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory®Á. / ®ÁSee Dan 7.13

40Mt 24:32 "Now learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is near.
40Mt 24:33 In the same way, when you see all these things, you can know his return is very near, right at the door.
40Mt 24:34 I tell you the truth, this generation®Á will not pass from the scene until all these things take place. / ®ÁOr this age, or this nation

40Mt 24:37 "When the Son of Man returns, it will be like it was in Noah's day.
40Mt 24:38 In those days before the flood, the people were enjoying banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat.
40Mt 24:39 People didn't realize what was going to happen until the flood came and swept them all away. That is the way it will be when the Son of Man comes.
40Mt 24:40 "Two men will be working together in the field; one will be taken, the other left.
40Mt 24:41 Two women will be grinding flour at the mill; one will be taken, the other left.
40Mt 24:42 "So you, too, must keep watch! For you don't know what day your Lord is coming.
40Mt 24:43 Understand this£∫ If a homeowner knew exactly when a burglar was coming, he would keep watch and not permit his house to be broken into.
40Mt 24:44 You also must be ready all the time, for the Son of Man will come when least expected.
40Mt 24:45 "A faithful, sensible servant is one to whom the master can give the responsibility of managing his other household servants and feeding them.
40Mt 24:46 If the master returns and finds that the servant has done a good job, there will be a reward.
40Mt 24:47 I tell you the truth, the master will put that servant in charge of all he owns.
40Mt 24:48 But what if the servant is evil and thinks, `My master won't be back for a while,'
40Mt 24:49 and he begins beating the other servants, partying, and getting drunk?
40Mt 24:50 The master will return unannounced and unexpected,
40Mt 24:51 and he will cut the servant to pieces and assign him a place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.
40Mt 25:1 "Then the Kingdom of Heaven will be like ten bridesmaids®Á who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. / ®ÁOr virgins; also in 25.7, 11
40Mt 25:2 Five of them were foolish, and five were wise.
40Mt 25:3 The five who were foolish didn't take enough olive oil for their lamps,
40Mt 25:4 but the other five were wise enough to take along extra oil.
40Mt 25:5 When the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and fell asleep.
40Mt 25:6 "At midnight they were roused by the shout, `Look, the bridegroom is coming! Come out and meet him!'
40Mt 25:7 "All the bridesmaids got up and prepared their lamps.
40Mt 25:8 Then the five foolish ones asked the others, `Please give us some of your oil because our lamps are going out.'
40Mt 25:9 "But the others replied, `We don't have enough for all of us. Go to a shop and buy some for yourselves.'
40Mt 25:10 "But while they were gone to buy oil, the bridegroom came. Then those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was locked.
40Mt 25:11 Later, when the other five bridesmaids returned, they stood outside, calling, `Lord! Lord! Open the door for us!'
40Mt 25:12 "But he called back, `Believe me, I don't know you!'
40Mt 25:13 "So you, too, must keep watch! For you do not know the day or hour of my return.
40Mt 25:14 "Again, the Kingdom of Heaven can be illustrated by the story of a man going on a long trip. He called together his servants and entrusted his money to them while he was gone.
40Mt 25:15 He gave five bags of silver®Á to one, two bags of silver to another, and one bag of silver to the last?dividing it in proportion to their abilities. He then left on his trip. / ®ÁGreek talents; also throughout the story. A talent is equal to 75 pounds or 34 kilograms

40Mt 25:18 But the servant who received the one bag of silver dug a hole in the ground and hid the master's money.
40Mt 25:19 "After a long time their master returned from his trip and called them to give an account of how they had used his money.
40Mt 25:20 The servant to whom he had entrusted the five bags of silver came forward with five more and said, `Master, you gave me five bags of silver to invest, and I have earned five more.'

40Mt 25:23 "The master said, `Well done, my good and faithful servant. You have been faithful in handling this small amount, so now I will give you many more responsibilities. Let's celebrate together!'
40Mt 25:24 "Then the servant with the one bag of silver came and said, `Master, I knew you were a harsh man, harvesting crops you didn't plant and gathering crops you didn't cultivate.
40Mt 25:25 I was afraid I would lose your money, so I hid it in the earth. Look, here is your money back.'
40Mt 25:26 "But the master replied, `You wicked and lazy servant! If you knew I harvested crops I didn't plant and gathered crops I didn't cultivate,
40Mt 25:27 why didn't you deposit my money in the bank? At least I could have gotten some interest on it.'
40Mt 25:28 "Then he ordered, `Take the money from this servant, and give it to the one with the ten bags of silver.
40Mt 25:29 To those who use well what they are given, even more will be given, and they will have an abundance. But from those who do nothing, even what little they have will be taken away.
40Mt 25:30 Now throw this useless servant into outer darkness, where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'
40Mt 25:31 "But when the Son of Man®Á comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit upon his glorious throne. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
40Mt 25:32 All the nations®Á will be gathered in his presence, and he will separate the people as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. / ®ÁOr peoples

40Mt 25:34 "Then the King will say to those on his right, `Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the Kingdom prepared for you from the creation of the world.
40Mt 25:35 For I was hungry, and you fed me. I was thirsty, and you gave me a drink. I was a stranger, and you invited me into your home.
40Mt 25:36 I was naked, and you gave me clothing. I was sick, and you cared for me. I was in prison, and you visited me.'
40Mt 25:37 "Then these righteous ones will reply, `Lord, when did we ever see you hungry and feed you? Or thirsty and give you something to drink?
40Mt 25:38 Or a stranger and show you hospitality? Or naked and give you clothing?

40Mt 25:45 "And he will answer, `I tell you the truth, when you refused to help the least of these my brothers and sisters, you were refusing to help me.'
40Mt 25:46 "And they will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life."
40Mt 26:1 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he said to his disciples,
40Mt 26:2 "As you know, Passover begins in two days, and the Son of Man®Á will be handed over to be crucified." / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
40Mt 26:3 At that same time the leading priests and elders were meeting at the residence of Caiaphas, the high priest,
40Mt 26:4 plotting how to capture Jesus secretly and kill him.
40Mt 26:5 "But not during the Passover celebration," they agreed, "or the people may riot."
40Mt 26:6 Meanwhile, Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon, a man who had previously had leprosy.
40Mt 26:7 While he was eating®Á, a woman came in with a beautiful alabaster jar of expensive perfume and poured it over his head. / ®ÁOr reclining
40Mt 26:8 The disciples were indignant when they saw this. "What a waste!" they said.
40Mt 26:9 "It could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the poor."
40Mt 26:10 But Jesus, aware of this, replied, "Why criticize this woman for doing such a good thing to me?
40Mt 26:11 You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me.
40Mt 26:12 She has poured this perfume on me to prepare my body for burial.
40Mt 26:13 I tell you the truth, wherever the Good News is preached throughout the world, this woman's deed will be remembered and discussed."
40Mt 26:14 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the leading priests
40Mt 26:15 and asked, "How much will you pay me to betray Jesus to you?" And they gave him thirty pieces of silver.
40Mt 26:16 From that time on, Judas began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus.
40Mt 26:17 On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
40Mt 26:18 "As you go into the city," he told them, "you will see a certain man. Tell him, `The Teacher says£∫ My time has come, and I will eat the Passover meal with my disciples at your house.'"
40Mt 26:19 So the disciples did as Jesus told them and prepared the Passover meal there.
40Mt 26:20 When it was evening, Jesus sat down at the table®Á with the twelve disciples®Ë. / ®ÁOr Jesus reclined ®ËSome manuscripts read the Twelve
40Mt 26:21 While they were eating, he said, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me."
40Mt 26:22 Greatly distressed, each one asked in turn, "Am I the one, Lord?"
40Mt 26:23 He replied, "One of you who has just eaten from this bowl with me will betray me.
40Mt 26:24 For the Son of Man must die, as the Scriptures declared long ago. But how terrible it will be for the one who betrays him. It would be far better for that man if he had never been born!"
40Mt 26:25 Judas, the one who would betray him, also asked, "Rabbi, am I the one?" And Jesus told him, "You have said it."
40Mt 26:26 As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take this and eat it, for this is my body."
40Mt 26:27 And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them and said, "Each of you drink from it,
40Mt 26:28 for this is my blood, which confirms the covenant®Á between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice to forgive the sins of many. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read the new covenant
40Mt 26:29 Mark my words?I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new with you in my Father's Kingdom."
40Mt 26:30 Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.
40Mt 26:31 On the way, Jesus told them, "Tonight all of you will desert me. For the Scriptures say, `God will strike®Á the Shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' / ®ÁGreek I will strike. Zech 13.7
40Mt 26:32 But after I have been raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet you there."
40Mt 26:33 Peter declared, "Even if everyone else deserts you, I will never desert you."
40Mt 26:34 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, Peter?this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you even know me."
40Mt 26:35 "No!" Peter insisted. "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!" And all the other disciples vowed the same.
40Mt 26:36 Then Jesus went with them to the olive grove called Gethsemane, and he said, "Sit here while I go over there to pray."
40Mt 26:37 He took Peter and Zebedee's two sons, James and John, and he became anguished and distressed.
40Mt 26:38 He told them, "My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."
40Mt 26:39 He went on a little farther and bowed with his face to the ground, praying, "My Father! If it is possible, let this cup of suffering be taken away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine."
40Mt 26:40 Then he returned to the disciples and found them asleep. He said to Peter, "Couldn't you watch with me even one hour?
40Mt 26:41 Keep watch and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak!"
40Mt 26:42 Then Jesus left them a second time and prayed, "My Father! If this cup cannot be taken away®Á unless I drink it, your will be done." / ®ÁGreek If this cannot pass
40Mt 26:43 When he returned to them again, he found them sleeping, for they couldn't keep their eyes open.
40Mt 26:44 So he went to pray a third time, saying the same things again.
40Mt 26:45 Then he came to the disciples and said, "Go ahead and sleep. Have your rest. But look?the time has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
40Mt 26:46 Up, let's be going. Look, my betrayer is here!"
40Mt 26:47 And even as Jesus said this, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the leading priests and elders of the people.
40Mt 26:48 The traitor, Judas, had given them a prearranged signal£∫ "You will know which one to arrest when I greet him with a kiss."
40Mt 26:49 So Judas came straight to Jesus. "Greetings, Rabbi!" he exclaimed and gave him the kiss.
40Mt 26:50 Jesus said, "My friend, go ahead and do what you have come for." Then the others grabbed Jesus and arrested him.
40Mt 26:51 But one of the men with Jesus pulled out his sword and struck the high priest's slave, slashing off his ear.
40Mt 26:52 "Put away your sword," Jesus told him. "Those who use the sword will die by the sword.
40Mt 26:53 Don't you realize that I could ask my Father for thousands®Á of angels to protect us, and he would send them instantly? / ®ÁGreek twelve legions
40Mt 26:54 But if I did, how would the Scriptures be fulfilled that describe what must happen now?"
40Mt 26:55 Then Jesus said to the crowd, "Am I some dangerous revolutionary, that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me? Why didn't you arrest me in the Temple? I was there teaching every day.
40Mt 26:56 But this is all happening to fulfill the words of the prophets as recorded in the Scriptures." At that point, all the disciples deserted him and fled.
40Mt 26:57 Then the people who had arrested Jesus led him to the home of Caiaphas, the high priest, where the teachers of religious law and the elders had gathered.
40Mt 26:58 Meanwhile, Peter followed him at a distance and came to the high priest's courtyard. He went in and sat with the guards and waited to see how it would all end.
40Mt 26:59 Inside, the leading priests and the entire high council®Á were trying to find witnesses who would lie about Jesus, so they could put him to death. / ®ÁGreek the Sanhedrin
40Mt 26:60 But even though they found many who agreed to give false witness, they could not use anyone's testimony. Finally, two men came forward
40Mt 26:61 who declared, "This man said, `I am able to destroy the Temple of God and rebuild it in three days.'"
40Mt 26:62 Then the high priest stood up and said to Jesus, "Well, aren't you going to answer these charges? What do you have to say for yourself?"
40Mt 26:63 But Jesus remained silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I demand in the name of the living God?tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God."
40Mt 26:64 Jesus replied, "You have said it. And in the future you will see the Son of Man seated in the place of power at God's right hand®Á and coming on the clouds of heaven."®Ë / ®ÁGreek seated at the right hand of the power. See Ps 110.1 ®ËSee Dan 7.13
40Mt 26:65 Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said, "Blasphemy! Why do we need other witnesses? You have all heard his blasphemy.
40Mt 26:66 What is your verdict?" "Guilty!" they shouted. "He deserves to die!"
40Mt 26:67 Then they began to spit in Jesus' face and beat him with their fists. And some slapped him,
40Mt 26:68 jeering, "Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you that time?"
40Mt 26:69 Meanwhile, Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. A servant girl came over and said to him, "You were one of those with Jesus the Galilean."
40Mt 26:70 But Peter denied it in front of everyone. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said.
40Mt 26:71 Later, out by the gate, another servant girl noticed him and said to those standing around, "This man was with Jesus of Nazareth®Á." / ®ÁOr Jesus the Nazarene
40Mt 26:72 Again Peter denied it, this time with an oath. "I don't even know the man," he said.
40Mt 26:73 A little later some of the other bystanders came over to Peter and said, "You must be one of them; we can tell by your Galilean accent."
40Mt 26:74 Peter swore, "A curse on me if I'm lying?I don't know the man!" And immediately the rooster crowed.
40Mt 26:75 Suddenly, Jesus' words flashed through Peter's mind£∫ "Before the rooster crows, you will deny three times that you even know me." And he went away, weeping bitterly.
40Mt 27:1 Very early in the morning the leading priests and the elders met again to lay plans for putting Jesus to death.
40Mt 27:2 Then they bound him, led him away, and took him to Pilate, the Roman governor.
40Mt 27:3 When Judas, who had betrayed him, realized that Jesus had been condemned to die, he was filled with remorse. So he took the thirty pieces of silver back to the leading priests and the elders.
40Mt 27:4 "I have sinned," he declared, "for I have betrayed an innocent man." "What do we care?" they retorted. "That's your problem."
40Mt 27:5 Then Judas threw the silver coins down in the Temple and went out and hanged himself.
40Mt 27:6 The leading priests picked up the coins. "It wouldn't be right to put this money in the Temple treasury," they said, "since it was payment for murder."®Á / ®ÁGreek since it is the price for blood
40Mt 27:7 After some discussion they finally decided to buy the potter's field, and they made it into a cemetery for foreigners.
40Mt 27:8 That is why the field is still called the Field of Blood.
40Mt 27:9 This fulfilled the prophecy of Jeremiah that says, "They took®Á the thirty pieces of silver? the price at which he was valued by the people of Israel, / ®ÁOr I took
40Mt 27:10 and purchased the potter's field, as the LORD directed®Á." / ®ÁGreek as the LORD directed me. Zech 11.12-13; Jer 32.6-9
40Mt 27:11 Now Jesus was standing before Pilate, the Roman governor. "Are you the king of the Jews?" the governor asked him. Jesus replied, "You have said it."
40Mt 27:12 But when the leading priests and the elders made their accusations against him, Jesus remained silent.
40Mt 27:13 "Don't you hear all these charges they are bringing against you?" Pilate demanded.
40Mt 27:14 But Jesus made no response to any of the charges, much to the governor's surprise.
40Mt 27:15 Now it was the governor's custom each year during the Passover celebration to release one prisoner to the crowd?anyone they wanted.
40Mt 27:16 This year there was a notorious prisoner, a man named Barabbas®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read Jesus Barabbas; also in 27.17
40Mt 27:17 As the crowds gathered before Pilate's house that morning, he asked them, "Which one do you want me to release to you?Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
40Mt 27:18 (He knew very well that the religious leaders had arrested Jesus out of envy.)
40Mt 27:19 Just then, as Pilate was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent him this message£∫ "Leave that innocent man alone. I suffered through a terrible nightmare about him last night."
40Mt 27:20 Meanwhile, the leading priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas to be released and for Jesus to be put to death.
40Mt 27:21 So the governor asked again, "Which of these two do you want me to release to you?" The crowd shouted back, "Barabbas!"
40Mt 27:22 Pilate responded, "Then what should I do with Jesus who is called the Messiah?" They shouted back, "Crucify him!"
40Mt 27:23 "Why?" Pilate demanded. "What crime has he committed?" But the mob roared even louder, "Crucify him!"
40Mt 27:24 Pilate saw that he wasn't getting anywhere and that a riot was developing. So he sent for a bowl of water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. The responsibility is yours!"
40Mt 27:25 And all the people yelled back, "We will take responsibility for his death?we and our children!"®Á / ®ÁGreek "His blood be on us and on our children"
40Mt 27:26 So Pilate released Barabbas to them. He ordered Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip, then turned him over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified.
40Mt 27:27 Some of the governor's soldiers took Jesus into their headquarters®Á and called out the entire regiment. / ®ÁOr into the Praetorium
40Mt 27:28 They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.
40Mt 27:29 They wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head, and they placed a reed stick in his right hand as a scepter. Then they knelt before him in mockery and taunted, "Hail! King of the Jews!"
40Mt 27:30 And they spit on him and grabbed the stick and struck him on the head with it.
40Mt 27:31 When they were finally tired of mocking him, they took off the robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified.
40Mt 27:32 Along the way, they came across a man named Simon, who was from Cyrene®Á, and the soldiers forced him to carry Jesus' cross. / ®ÁCyrene was a city in northern Africa
40Mt 27:33 And they went out to a place called Golgotha (which means "Place of the Skull").
40Mt 27:34 The soldiers gave him wine mixed with bitter gall, but when he had tasted it, he refused to drink it.
40Mt 27:35 After they had nailed him to the cross, the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice®Á. / ®ÁGreek by casting lots. A few late manuscripts add This fulfilled the word of the prophet£∫ "They divided my garments among themselves and cast lots for my robe." See Ps 22.18
40Mt 27:36 Then they sat around and kept guard as he hung there.
40Mt 27:37 A sign was fastened to the cross above Jesus' head, announcing the charge against him. It read£∫ "This is Jesus, the King of the Jews."
40Mt 27:38 Two revolutionaries®Á were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. / ®ÁOr criminals; also in 27.44
40Mt 27:39 The people passing by shouted abuse, shaking their heads in mockery.
40Mt 27:40 "Look at you now!" they yelled at him. "You said you were going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days. Well then, if you are the Son of God, save yourself and come down from the cross!"
40Mt 27:41 The leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders also mocked Jesus.
40Mt 27:42 "He saved others," they scoffed, "but he can't save himself! So he is the King of Israel, is he? Let him come down from the cross right now, and we will believe in him!
40Mt 27:43 He trusted God, so let God rescue him now if he wants him! For he said, `I am the Son of God.'"
40Mt 27:44 Even the revolutionaries who were crucified with him ridiculed him in the same way.
40Mt 27:45 At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until three o'clock.
40Mt 27:46 At about three o'clock, Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli®Á, lema sabachthani?" which means "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"®Ë / ®ÁSome manuscripts read Eloi, Eloi ®ËPs 22.1
40Mt 27:47 Some of the bystanders misunderstood and thought he was calling for the prophet Elijah.
40Mt 27:48 One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, holding it up to him on a reed stick so he could drink.
40Mt 27:49 But the rest said, "Wait! Let's see whether Elijah comes to save him."®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts add And another took a spear and pierced his side, and out flowed water and blood. Compare John 19.34
40Mt 27:50 Then Jesus shouted out again, and he released his spirit.
40Mt 27:51 At that moment the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. The earth shook, rocks split apart,
40Mt 27:52 and tombs opened. The bodies of many godly men and women who had died were raised from the dead.
40Mt 27:53 They left the cemetery after Jesus' resurrection, went into the holy city of Jerusalem, and appeared to many people.
40Mt 27:54 The Roman officer®Á and the other soldiers at the crucifixion were terrified by the earthquake and all that had happened. They said, "This man truly was the Son of God!" / ®ÁGreek The centurion
40Mt 27:55 And many women who had come from Galilee with Jesus to care for him were watching from a distance.
40Mt 27:56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary ®Á, and the mother of James and John, the sons of Zebedee. / ®Áthe mother of James and Joseph
40Mt 27:57 As evening approached, Joseph, a rich man from Arimathea who had become a follower of Jesus,
40Mt 27:58 went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body. And Pilate issued an order to release it to him.
40Mt 27:59 Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a long sheet of clean linen cloth.
40Mt 27:60 He placed it in his own new tomb, which had been carved out of the rock. Then he rolled a great stone across the entrance and left.
40Mt 27:61 Both Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were sitting across from the tomb and watching.
40Mt 27:62 The next day, on the Sabbath®Á, the leading priests and Pharisees went to see Pilate. / ®ÁOr On the next day, which is after the Preparation
40Mt 27:63 They told him, "Sir, we remember what that deceiver once said while he was still alive£∫ `After three days I will rise from the dead.'
40Mt 27:64 So we request that you seal the tomb until the third day. This will prevent his disciples from coming and stealing his body and then telling everyone he was raised from the dead! If that happens, we'll be worse off than we were at first."
40Mt 27:65 Pilate replied, "Take guards and secure it the best you can."
40Mt 27:66 So they sealed the tomb and posted guards to protect it.
40Mt 28:1 Early on Sunday morning®Á, as the new day was dawning, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went out to visit the tomb. / ®ÁGreek After the Sabbath, on the first day of the week
40Mt 28:2 Suddenly there was a great earthquake! For an angel of the Lord came down from heaven, rolled aside the stone, and sat on it.
40Mt 28:3 His face shone like lightning, and his clothing was as white as snow.
40Mt 28:4 The guards shook with fear when they saw him, and they fell into a dead faint.
40Mt 28:5 Then the angel spoke to the women. "Don't be afraid!" he said. "I know you are looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
40Mt 28:6 He isn't here! He is risen from the dead, just as he said would happen. Come, see where his body was lying.
40Mt 28:7 And now, go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and he is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there. Remember what I have told you."
40Mt 28:8 The women ran quickly from the tomb. They were very frightened but also filled with great joy, and they rushed to give the disciples the angel's message.
40Mt 28:9 And as they went, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they ran to him, grasped his feet, and worshiped him.
40Mt 28:10 Then Jesus said to them, "Don't be afraid! Go tell my brothers to leave for Galilee, and they will see me there."
40Mt 28:11 As the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the leading priests what had happened.
40Mt 28:12 A meeting with the elders was called, and they decided to give the soldiers a large bribe.
40Mt 28:13 They told the soldiers, "You must say, `Jesus' disciples came during the night while we were sleeping, and they stole his body.'
40Mt 28:14 If the governor hears about it, we'll stand up for you so you won't get in trouble."
40Mt 28:15 So the guards accepted the bribe and said what they were told to say. Their story spread widely among the Jews, and they still tell it today.
40Mt 28:16 Then the eleven disciples left for Galilee, going to the mountain where Jesus had told them to go.
40Mt 28:17 When they saw him, they worshiped him?but some of them doubted!
40Mt 28:18 Jesus came and told his disciples, "I have been given all authority in heaven and on earth.
40Mt 28:19 Therefore, go and make disciples of all the nations®Á, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. / ®ÁOr all peoples
40Mt 28:20 Teach these new disciples to obey all the commands I have given you. And be sure of this£∫ I am with you always, even to the end of the age."

41Mk 1:1 This is the Good News about Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God®Á. It began / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include the Son of God 
41Mk 1:2 just as the prophet Isaiah had written£∫ "Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way®Á. / ®ÁMal 3.1
41Mk 1:3 He is a voice shouting in the wilderness, `Prepare the way for the LORD's coming! Clear the road for him!'®Á" / ®ÁIsa 40.3 (Greek version)
41Mk 1:4 This messenger was John the Baptist. He was in the wilderness and preached that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven.
41Mk 1:5 All of Judea, including all the people of Jerusalem, went out to see and hear John. And when they confessed their sins, he baptized them in the Jordan River.
41Mk 1:6 His clothes were woven from coarse camel hair, and he wore a leather belt around his waist. For food he ate locusts and wild honey.
41Mk 1:7 John announced£∫ "Someone is coming soon who is greater than I am - so much greater that I'm not even worthy to stoop down like a slave and untie the straps of his sandals.
41Mk 1:8 I baptize you with®Á water, but he will baptize you with®Ë the Holy Spirit!" / ®ÁOr in ®ËOr in
41Mk 1:9 One day Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee, and John baptized him in the Jordan River.
41Mk 1:10 As Jesus came up out of the water, he saw the heavens splitting apart and the Holy Spirit descending on him®Á like a dove. / ®ÁOr toward him, or into him
41Mk 1:11 And a voice from heaven said, "You are my dearly loved Son, and you bring me great joy."
41Mk 1:12 The Spirit then compelled Jesus to go into the wilderness,
41Mk 1:13 where he was tempted by Satan for forty days. He was out among the wild animals, and angels took care of him.
41Mk 1:14 Later on, after John was arrested, Jesus went into Galilee, where he preached God's Good News®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read the Good News of the Kingdom of God
41Mk 1:15 "The time promised by God has come at last!" he announced. "The Kingdom of God is near! Repent of your sins and believe the Good News!"
41Mk 1:16 One day as Jesus was walking along the shore of the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon®Á and his brother Andrew throwing a net into the water, for they fished for a living. / ®ÁSimon is called "Peter" in 3.16 and thereafter
41Mk 1:17 Jesus called out to them, "Come, follow me, and I will show you how to fish for people!"
41Mk 1:18 And they left their nets at once and followed him.
41Mk 1:19 A little farther up the shore Jesus saw Zebedee's sons, James and John, in a boat repairing their nets.
41Mk 1:20 He called them at once, and they also followed him, leaving their father, Zebedee, in the boat with the hired men.
41Mk 1:21 Jesus and his companions went to the town of Capernaum. When the Sabbath day came, he went into the synagogue and began to teach.
41Mk 1:22 The people were amazed at his teaching, for he taught with real authority?quite unlike the teachers of religious law.
41Mk 1:23 Suddenly, a man in the synagogue who was possessed by an evil®Á spirit began shouting, / ®ÁGreek unclean; also in 1.26, 27
41Mk 1:24 "Why are you interfering with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are?the Holy One sent from God!"
41Mk 1:25 Jesus cut him short. "Be quiet! Come out of the man," he ordered.
41Mk 1:26 At that, the evil spirit screamed, threw the man into a convulsion, and then came out of him.
41Mk 1:27 Amazement gripped the audience, and they began to discuss what had happened. "What sort of new teaching is this?" they asked excitedly. "It has such authority! Even evil spirits obey his orders!"
41Mk 1:28 The news about Jesus spread quickly throughout the entire region of Galilee.
41Mk 1:29 After Jesus left the synagogue with James and John, they went to Simon and Andrew's home.
41Mk 1:30 Now Simon's mother-in-law was sick in bed with a high fever. They told Jesus about her right away.
41Mk 1:31 So he went to her bedside, took her by the hand, and helped her sit up. Then the fever left her, and she prepared a meal for them.
41Mk 1:32 That evening after sunset, many sick and demon-possessed people were brought to Jesus.
41Mk 1:33 The whole town gathered at the door to watch.
41Mk 1:34 So Jesus healed many people who were sick with various diseases, and he cast out many demons. But because the demons knew who he was, he did not allow them to speak.
41Mk 1:35 Before daybreak the next morning, Jesus got up and went out to an isolated place to pray.
41Mk 1:36 Later Simon and the others went out to find him.
41Mk 1:37 When they found him, they said, "Everyone is looking for you."
41Mk 1:38 But Jesus replied, "We must go on to other towns as well, and I will preach to them, too. That is why I came."
41Mk 1:39 So he traveled throughout the region of Galilee, preaching in the synagogues and casting out demons.
41Mk 1:40 A man with leprosy came and knelt in front of Jesus, begging to be healed. "If you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean," he said.
41Mk 1:41 Moved with compassion®Á, Jesus reached out and touched him. "I am willing," he said. "Be healed!" / ®ÁSome manuscripts read Moved with anger
41Mk 1:42 Instantly the leprosy disappeared, and the man was healed.
41Mk 1:43 Then Jesus sent him on his way with a stern warning.
41Mk 1:44 "Don't tell anyone about this. Instead, go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy®Á. This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed." / ®ÁSee Lev 14.2-32
41Mk 1:45 But the man went and spread the word, proclaiming to everyone what had happened. As a result, large crowds soon surrounded Jesus, and he couldn't publicly enter a town anywhere. He had to stay out in the secluded places, but people from everywhere kept coming to him.
41Mk 2:1 When Jesus returned to Capernaum several days later, the news spread quickly that he was back home.
41Mk 2:2 Soon the house where he was staying was so packed with visitors that there was no more room, even outside the door. While he was preaching God's word to them,
41Mk 2:3 four men arrived carrying a paralyzed man on a mat.
41Mk 2:4 They couldn't bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, so they dug a hole through the roof above his head. Then they lowered the man on his mat, right down in front of Jesus.
41Mk 2:5 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralyzed man, "My child, your sins are forgiven."
41Mk 2:6 But some of the teachers of religious law who were sitting there thought to themselves,
41Mk 2:7 "What is he saying? This is blasphemy! Only God can forgive sins!"
41Mk 2:8 Jesus knew immediately what they were thinking, so he asked them, "Why do you question this in your hearts?
41Mk 2:9 Is it easier to say to the paralyzed man `Your sins are forgiven,' or `Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk'?
41Mk 2:10 So I will prove to you that the Son of Man®Á has the authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
41Mk 2:11 "Stand up, pick up your mat, and go home!"
41Mk 2:12 And the man jumped up, grabbed his mat, and walked out through the stunned onlookers.They were all amazed and praised God, exclaiming, "We've never seen anything like this before!"
41Mk 2:13 Then Jesus went out to the lakeshore again and taught the crowds that were coming to him.
41Mk 2:14 As he walked along, he saw Levi son of Alphaeus sitting at his tax collector's booth. "Follow me and be my disciple," Jesus said to him. So Levi got up and followed him.
41Mk 2:15 Later, Levi invited Jesus and his disciples to his home as dinner guests, along with many tax collectors and other disreputable sinners.®Á / ®ÁThere were many people of this kind among Jesus' followers
41Mk 2:16 But when the teachers of religious law who were Pharisees®Á saw him eating with tax collectors and other sinners, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat with such scum?®Ë" / ®ÁGreek the scribes of the Pharisees ®ËGreek with tax collectors and sinners?
41Mk 2:17 When Jesus heard this, he told them, "Healthy people don't need a doctor?sick people do. I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners."
41Mk 2:18 Once when John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting, some people came to Jesus and asked, "Why don't your disciples fast like John's disciples and the Pharisees do?"
41Mk 2:19 Jesus replied, "Do wedding guests fast while celebrating with the groom? Of course not. They can't fast while the groom is with them.
41Mk 2:20 But someday the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast.
41Mk 2:21 "Besides, who would patch old clothing with new cloth? For the new patch would shrink and rip away from the old cloth, leaving an even bigger tear than before.
41Mk 2:22 "And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the wine would burst the wineskins, and the wine and the skins would both be lost. New wine calls for new wineskins."
41Mk 2:23 One Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grainfields, his disciples began breaking off heads of grain to eat.
41Mk 2:24 But the Pharisees said to Jesus, "Look, why are they breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath?"
41Mk 2:25 Jesus said to them, "Haven't you ever read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
41Mk 2:26 He went into the house of God ®Á and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests are allowed to eat. He also gave some to his companions." / ®Áduring the days when Abiathar was high priest
41Mk 2:27 Then Jesus said to them, "The Sabbath was made to meet the needs of people, and not people to meet the requirements of the Sabbath.
41Mk 2:28 So the Son of Man is Lord, even over the Sabbath!"
41Mk 3:1 Jesus went into the synagogue again and noticed a man with a deformed hand.
41Mk 3:2 Since it was the Sabbath, Jesus' enemies watched him closely. If he healed the man's hand, they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath.
41Mk 3:3 Jesus said to the man with the deformed hand, "Come and stand in front of everyone."
41Mk 3:4 Then he turned to his critics and asked, "Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath, or is it a day for doing evil? Is this a day to save life or to destroy it?" But they wouldn't answer him.
41Mk 3:5 He looked around at them angrily and was deeply saddened by their hard hearts. Then he said to the man, "Hold out your hand." So the man held out his hand, and it was restored!
41Mk 3:6 At once the Pharisees went away and met with the supporters of Herod to plot how to kill Jesus.
41Mk 3:7 Jesus went out to the lake with his disciples, and a large crowd followed him. They came from all over Galilee, Judea,
41Mk 3:8 Jerusalem, Idumea, from east of the Jordan River, and even from as far north as Tyre and Sidon. The news about his miracles had spread far and wide, and vast numbers of people came to see him.
41Mk 3:9 Jesus instructed his disciples to have a boat ready so the crowd would not crush him.
41Mk 3:10 He had healed many people that day, so all the sick people eagerly pushed forward to touch him.
41Mk 3:11 And whenever those possessed by evil®Á spirits caught sight of him, the spirits would throw them to the ground in front of him shrieking, "You are the Son of God!" / ®ÁGreek unclean; also in 3.30
41Mk 3:12 But Jesus sternly commanded the spirits not to reveal who he was.
41Mk 3:13 Afterward Jesus went up on a mountain and called out the ones he wanted to go with him. And they came to him.
41Mk 3:14 Then he appointed twelve of them and called them his apostles®Á. They were to accompany him, and he would send them out to preach, / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include and called them his apostles
41Mk 3:15 giving them authority to cast out demons.

41Mk 3:19 Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him).
41Mk 3:20 One time Jesus entered a house, and the crowds began to gather again. Soon he and his disciples couldn't even find time to eat.
41Mk 3:21 When his family heard what was happening, they tried to take him away. "He's out of his mind," they said.
41Mk 3:22 But the teachers of religious law who had arrived from Jerusalem said, "He's possessed by Satan®Á, the prince of demons. That's where he gets the power to cast out demons." / ®ÁGreek Beelzeboul; other manuscripts read Beezeboul; Latin version reads Beelzebub
41Mk 3:23 Jesus called them over and responded with an illustration. "How can Satan cast out Satan?" he asked.
41Mk 3:24 "A kingdom divided by civil war will collapse.
41Mk 3:25 Similarly, a family splintered by feuding will fall apart.
41Mk 3:26 And if Satan is divided and fights against himself, how can he stand? He would never survive.
41Mk 3:27 Let me illustrate this further. Who is powerful enough to enter the house of a strong man like Satan and plunder his goods? Only someone even stronger?someone who could tie him up and then plunder his house.
41Mk 3:28 "I tell you the truth, all sin and blasphemy can be forgiven,
41Mk 3:29 but anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will never be forgiven. This is a sin with eternal consequences."
41Mk 3:30 He told them this because they were saying, "He's possessed by an evil spirit."
41Mk 3:31 Then Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him. They stood outside and sent word for him to come out and talk with them.
41Mk 3:32 There was a crowd sitting around Jesus, and someone said, "Your mother and your brothers®Á are outside asking for you." / ®ÁSome manuscripts add and sisters
41Mk 3:33 Jesus replied, "Who is my mother? Who are my brothers?"
41Mk 3:34 Then he looked at those around him and said, "Look, these are my mother and brothers.
41Mk 3:35 Anyone who does God's will is my brother and sister and mother."
41Mk 4:1 Once again Jesus began teaching by the lakeshore. A very large crowd soon gathered around him, so he got into a boat. Then he sat in the boat while all the people remained on the shore.
41Mk 4:2 He taught them by telling many stories in the form of parables, such as this one.
41Mk 4:3 "Listen! A farmer went out to plant some seed.
41Mk 4:4 As he scattered it across his field, some of the seed fell on a footpath, and the birds came and ate it.
41Mk 4:5 Other seed fell on shallow soil with underlying rock. The seed sprouted quickly because the soil was shallow.
41Mk 4:6 But the plant soon wilted under the hot sun, and since it didn't have deep roots, it died.
41Mk 4:7 Other seed fell among thorns that grew up and choked out the tender plants so they produced no grain.
41Mk 4:8 Still other seeds fell on fertile soil, and they sprouted, grew, and produced a crop that was thirty, sixty, and even a hundred times as much as had been planted!"
41Mk 4:9 Then he said, "Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand."
41Mk 4:10 Later, when Jesus was alone with the twelve disciples and with the others who were gathered around, they asked him what the parables meant.
41Mk 4:11 He replied, "You are permitted to understand the secret®Á of the Kingdom of God. But I use parables for everything I say to outsiders, / ®ÁGreek mystery
41Mk 4:12 so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled£∫ `When they see what I do, they will learn nothing. When they hear what I say, they will not understand. Otherwise, they will turn to me and be forgiven.'®Á" / ®ÁIsa 6.9-10 (Greek version)
41Mk 4:13 Then Jesus said to them, "If you can't understand the meaning of this parable, how will you understand all the other parables?
41Mk 4:14 The farmer plants seed by taking God's word to others.
41Mk 4:15 The seed that fell on the footpath represents those who hear the message, only to have Satan come at once and take it away.
41Mk 4:16 The seed on the rocky soil represents those who hear the message and immediately receive it with joy.
41Mk 4:17 But since they don't have deep roots, they don't last long. They fall away as soon as they have problems or are persecuted for believing God's word.
41Mk 4:18 The seed that fell among the thorns represents others who hear God's word,
41Mk 4:19 but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the worries of this life, the lure of wealth, and the desire for other things, so no fruit is produced.
41Mk 4:20 And the seed that fell on good soil represents those who hear and accept God's word and produce a harvest of thirty, sixty, or even a hundred times as much as had been planted!"
41Mk 4:21 Then Jesus asked them, "Would anyone light a lamp and then put it under a basket or under a bed? Of course not! A lamp is placed on a stand, where its light will shine.
41Mk 4:22 For everything that is hidden will eventually be brought into the open, and every secret will be brought to light.
41Mk 4:23 Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand."
41Mk 4:24 Then he added, "Pay close attention to what you hear. The closer you listen, the more understanding you will be given®Á - and you will receive even more. / ®ÁOr The measure you give will be the measure you get back
41Mk 4:25 To those who listen to my teaching, more understanding will be given. But for those who are not listening, even what little understanding they have will be taken away from them."
41Mk 4:26 Jesus also said, "The Kingdom of God is like a farmer who scatters seed on the ground.
41Mk 4:27 Night and day, while he's asleep or awake, the seed sprouts and grows, but he does not understand how it happens.
41Mk 4:28 The earth produces the crops on its own. First a leaf blade pushes through, then the heads of wheat are formed, and finally the grain ripens.
41Mk 4:29 And as soon as the grain is ready, the farmer comes and harvests it with a sickle, for the harvest time has come."
41Mk 4:30 Jesus said, "How can I describe the Kingdom of God? What story should I use to illustrate it?
41Mk 4:31 It is like a mustard seed planted in the ground. It is the smallest of all seeds,
41Mk 4:32 but it becomes the largest of all garden plants; it grows long branches, and birds can make nests in its shade."
41Mk 4:33 Jesus used many similar stories and illustrations to teach the people as much as they could understand.
41Mk 4:34 In fact, in his public ministry he never taught without using parables; but afterward, when he was alone with his disciples, he explained everything to them.
41Mk 4:35 As evening came, Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's cross to the other side of the lake."
41Mk 4:36 So they took Jesus in the boat and started out, leaving the crowds behind ®Á. / ®Áalthough other boats followed
41Mk 4:37 But soon a fierce storm came up. High waves were breaking into the boat, and it began to fill with water.
41Mk 4:38 Jesus was sleeping at the back of the boat with his head on a cushion. The disciples woke him up, shouting, "Teacher, don't you care that we're going to drown?"
41Mk 4:39 When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and said to the waves, "Silence! Be still!" Suddenly the wind stopped, and there was a great calm.
41Mk 4:40 Then he asked them, "Why are you afraid? Do you still have no faith?"
41Mk 4:41 The disciples were absolutely terrified. "Who is this man?" they asked each other. "Even the wind and waves obey him!"
41Mk 5:1 So they arrived at the other side of the lake, in the region of the Gerasenes®Á. / ®ÁOther manuscripts read Gadarenes; still others read Gergesenes. See Matt 8.28; Luke 8.26
41Mk 5:2 When Jesus climbed out of the boat, a man possessed by an evil®Á spirit came out from a cemetery to meet him. / ®ÁGreek unclean; also in 5.8, 13
41Mk 5:3 This man lived among the burial caves and could no longer be restrained, even with a chain.
41Mk 5:4 Whenever he was put into chains and shackles?as he often was?he snapped the chains from his wrists and smashed the shackles. No one was strong enough to subdue him.
41Mk 5:5 Day and night he wandered among the burial caves and in the hills, howling and cutting himself with sharp stones.
41Mk 5:6 When Jesus was still some distance away, the man saw him, ran to meet him, and bowed low before him.
41Mk 5:7 With a shriek, he screamed, "Why are you interfering with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? In the name of God, I beg you, don't torture me!"
41Mk 5:8 For Jesus had already said to the spirit, "Come out of the man, you evil spirit."
41Mk 5:9 Then Jesus demanded, "What is your name?" And he replied, "My name is Legion, because there are many of us inside this man."
41Mk 5:10 Then the evil spirits begged him again and again not to send them to some distant place.
41Mk 5:11 There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby.
41Mk 5:12 "Send us into those pigs," the spirits begged. "Let us enter them."
41Mk 5:13 So Jesus gave them permission. The evil spirits came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the entire herd of 2,000 pigs plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned in the water.
41Mk 5:14 The herdsmen fled to the nearby town and the surrounding countryside, spreading the news as they ran. People rushed out to see what had happened.
41Mk 5:15 A crowd soon gathered around Jesus, and they saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons. He was sitting there fully clothed and perfectly sane, and they were all afraid.
41Mk 5:16 Then those who had seen what happened told the others about the demon-possessed man and the pigs.
41Mk 5:17 And the crowd began pleading with Jesus to go away and leave them alone.
41Mk 5:18 As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon possessed begged to go with him.
41Mk 5:19 But Jesus said, "No, go home to your family, and tell them everything the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been."
41Mk 5:20 So the man started off to visit the Ten Towns®Á of that region and began to proclaim the great things Jesus had done for him; and everyone was amazed at what he told them. / ®ÁGreek Decapolis
41Mk 5:21 Jesus got into the boat again and went back to the other side of the lake, where a large crowd gathered around him on the shore.
41Mk 5:22 Then a leader of the local synagogue, whose name was Jairus, arrived. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet,
41Mk 5:23 pleading fervently with him. "My little daughter is dying," he said. "Please come and lay your hands on her; heal her so she can live."
41Mk 5:24 Jesus went with him, and all the people followed, crowding around him.
41Mk 5:25 A woman in the crowd had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding.
41Mk 5:26 She had suffered a great deal from many doctors, and over the years she had spent everything she had to pay them, but she had gotten no better. In fact, she had gotten worse.
41Mk 5:27 She had heard about Jesus, so she came up behind him through the crowd and touched his robe.
41Mk 5:28 For she thought to herself, "If I can just touch his robe, I will be healed."
41Mk 5:29 Immediately the bleeding stopped, and she could feel in her body that she had been healed of her terrible condition.
41Mk 5:30 Jesus realized at once that healing power had gone out from him, so he turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my robe?"
41Mk 5:31 His disciples said to him, "Look at this crowd pressing around you. How can you ask, `Who touched me?'"
41Mk 5:32 But he kept on looking around to see who had done it.
41Mk 5:33 Then the frightened woman, trembling at the realization of what had happened to her, came and fell to her knees in front of him and told him what she had done.
41Mk 5:34 And he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace. Your suffering is over."
41Mk 5:35 While he was still speaking to her, messengers arrived from the home of Jairus, the leader of the synagogue. They told him, "Your daughter is dead. There's no use troubling the Teacher now."
41Mk 5:36 But Jesus overheard®Á them and said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid. Just have faith." / ®ÁOr ignored
41Mk 5:37 Then Jesus stopped the crowd and wouldn't let anyone go with him except Peter, James, and John (the brother of James).
41Mk 5:38 When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw much commotion and weeping and wailing.
41Mk 5:39 He went inside and asked, "Why all this commotion and weeping? The child isn't dead; she's only asleep."
41Mk 5:40 The crowd laughed at him. But he made them all leave, and he took the girl's father and mother and his three disciples into the room where the girl was lying.
41Mk 5:41 Holding her hand, he said to her, "Talitha koum," which means "Little girl, get up!"
41Mk 5:42 And the girl, who was twelve years old, immediately stood up and walked around! They were overwhelmed and totally amazed.
41Mk 5:43 Jesus gave them strict orders not to tell anyone what had happened, and then he told them to give her something to eat.
41Mk 6:1 Jesus left that part of the country and returned with his disciples to Nazareth, his hometown.
41Mk 6:2 The next Sabbath he began teaching in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed. They asked, "Where did he get all this wisdom and the power to perform such miracles?"
41Mk 6:3 Then they scoffed, "He's just a carpenter, the son of Mary®Á and the brother of James, Joseph®Ë, Judas, and Simon. And his sisters live right here among us." They were deeply offended and refused to believe in him. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read He's just the son of the carpenter and of Mary ®ËMost manuscripts read Joses; see Matt 13.55
41Mk 6:4 Then Jesus told them, "A prophet is honored everywhere except in his own hometown and among his relatives and his own family."
41Mk 6:5 And because of their unbelief, he couldn't do any miracles among them except to place his hands on a few sick people and heal them.
41Mk 6:6 And he was amazed at their unbelief. Then Jesus went from village to village, teaching the people.
41Mk 6:7 And he called his twelve disciples together and began sending them out two by two, giving them authority to cast out evil®Á spirits. / ®ÁGreek unclean
41Mk 6:8 He told them to take nothing for their journey except a walking stick?no food, no traveler's bag, no money®Á. / ®ÁGreek no copper coins in their money belts
41Mk 6:9 He allowed them to wear sandals but not to take a change of clothes.
41Mk 6:10 "Wherever you go," he said, "stay in the same house until you leave town.
41Mk 6:11 But if any place refuses to welcome you or listen to you, shake its dust from your feet as you leave to show that you have abandoned those people to their fate."
41Mk 6:12 So the disciples went out, telling everyone they met to repent of their sins and turn to God.
41Mk 6:13 And they cast out many demons and healed many sick people, anointing them with olive oil.
41Mk 6:14 Herod Antipas, the king, soon heard about Jesus, because everyone was talking about him. Some were saying®Á, "This must be John the Baptist raised from the dead. That is why he can do such miracles." / ®ÁSome manuscripts read He was saying
41Mk 6:15 Others said, "He's the prophet Elijah." Still others said, "He's a prophet like the other great prophets of the past."
41Mk 6:16 When Herod heard about Jesus, he said, "John, the man I beheaded, has come back from the dead."
41Mk 6:17 For Herod had sent soldiers to arrest and imprison John as a favor to Herodias. She had been his brother Philip's wife, but Herod had married her.
41Mk 6:18 John had been telling Herod, "It is against God's law for you to marry your brother's wife."
41Mk 6:19 So Herodias bore a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But without Herod's approval she was powerless,
41Mk 6:20 for Herod respected John; and knowing that he was a good and holy man, he protected him. Herod was greatly disturbed whenever he talked with John, but even so, he liked to listen to him.
41Mk 6:21 Herodias's chance finally came on Herod's birthday. He gave a party for his high government officials, army officers, and the leading citizens of Galilee.
41Mk 6:22 Then his daughter, also named Herodias®Á, came in and performed a dance that greatly pleased Herod and his guests. "Ask me for anything you like," the king said to the girl, "and I will give it to you." / ®ÁSome manuscripts read the daughter of Herodias herself
41Mk 6:23 He even vowed, "I will give you whatever you ask, up to half my kingdom!"
41Mk 6:24 She went out and asked her mother, "What should I ask for?" Her mother told her, "Ask for the head of John the Baptist!"
41Mk 6:25 So the girl hurried back to the king and told him, "I want the head of John the Baptist, right now, on a tray!"
41Mk 6:26 Then the king deeply regretted what he had said; but because of the vows he had made in front of his guests, he couldn't refuse her.
41Mk 6:27 So he immediately sent an executioner to the prison to cut off John's head and bring it to him. The soldier beheaded John in the prison,
41Mk 6:28 brought his head on a tray, and gave it to the girl, who took it to her mother.
41Mk 6:29 When John's disciples heard what had happened, they came to get his body and buried it in a tomb.
41Mk 6:30 The apostles returned to Jesus from their ministry tour and told him all they had done and taught.
41Mk 6:31 Then Jesus said, "Let's go off by ourselves to a quiet place and rest awhile." He said this because there were so many people coming and going that Jesus and his apostles didn't even have time to eat.
41Mk 6:32 So they left by boat for a quiet place, where they could be alone.
41Mk 6:33 But many people recognized them and saw them leaving, and people from many towns ran ahead along the shore and got there ahead of them.
41Mk 6:34 Jesus saw the huge crowd as he stepped from the boat, and he had compassion on them because they were like sheep without a shepherd. So he began teaching them many things.
41Mk 6:35 Late in the afternoon his disciples came to him and said, "This is a remote place, and it's already getting late.
41Mk 6:36 Send the crowds away so they can go to the nearby farms and villages and buy something to eat."
41Mk 6:37 But Jesus said, "You feed them." "With what?" they asked. "We'd have to work for months to earn enough money®Á to buy food for all these people!" / ®ÁGreek It would take 200 denarii. A denarius was equivalent to a laborer's full day's wage
41Mk 6:38 "How much bread do you have?" he asked. "Go and find out." They came back and reported, "We have five loaves of bread and two fish."
41Mk 6:39 Then Jesus told the disciples to have the people sit down in groups on the green grass.
41Mk 6:40 So they sat down in groups of fifty or a hundred.
41Mk 6:41 Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, looked up toward heaven, and blessed them. Then, breaking the loaves into pieces, he kept giving the bread to the disciples so they could distribute it to the people. He also divided the fish for everyone to share.
41Mk 6:42 They all ate as much as they wanted,
41Mk 6:43 and afterward, the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftover bread and fish.
41Mk 6:44 A total of 5,000 men and their families were fed from those loaves!
41Mk 6:45 Immediately after this, Jesus insisted that his disciples get back into the boat and head across the lake to Bethsaida, while he sent the people home.
41Mk 6:46 After telling everyone good-bye, he went up into the hills by himself to pray.
41Mk 6:47 Late that night, the disciples were in their boat in the middle of the lake, and Jesus was alone on land.
41Mk 6:48 He saw that they were in serious trouble, rowing hard and struggling against the wind and waves. About three o'clock in the morning®Á Jesus came toward them, walking on the water. He intended to go past them, / ®ÁGreek About the fourth watch of the night
41Mk 6:49 but when they saw him walking on the water, they cried out in terror, thinking he was a ghost.
41Mk 6:50 They were all terrified when they saw him. But Jesus spoke to them at once. "Don't be afraid," he said. "Take courage! I am here!®Á" / ®ÁOr The `I AM' is here; Greek reads I am. See Exod 3.14
41Mk 6:51 Then he climbed into the boat, and the wind stopped. They were totally amazed,
41Mk 6:52 for they still didn't understand the significance of the miracle of the loaves. Their hearts were too hard to take it in.
41Mk 6:53 After they had crossed the lake, they landed at Gennesaret. They brought the boat to shore
41Mk 6:54 and climbed out. The people recognized Jesus at once,
41Mk 6:55 and they ran throughout the whole area, carrying sick people on mats to wherever they heard he was.
41Mk 6:56 Wherever he went - in villages, cities, or the countryside - they brought the sick out to the marketplaces. They begged him to let the sick touch at least the fringe of his robe, and all who touched him were healed.
41Mk 7:1 One day some Pharisees and teachers of religious law arrived from Jerusalem to see Jesus.
41Mk 7:2 They noticed that some of his disciples failed to follow the Jewish ritual of hand washing before eating.
41Mk 7:3 (The Jews, especially the Pharisees, do not eat until they have poured water over their cupped hands®Á, as required by their ancient traditions. / ®ÁGreek have washed with the fist
41Mk 7:4 Similarly, they don't eat anything from the market until they immerse their hands®Á in water. This is but one of many traditions they have clung to?such as their ceremonial washing of cups, pitchers, and kettles®Ë.) / ®ÁSome manuscripts read sprinkle themselves ®ËSome manuscripts add and dining couches
41Mk 7:5 So the Pharisees and teachers of religious law asked him, "Why don't your disciples follow our age-old tradition? They eat without first performing the hand-washing ceremony."
41Mk 7:6 Jesus replied, "You hypocrites! Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you, for he wrote, `These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
41Mk 7:7 Their worship is a farce, for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God.'®Á / ®ÁIsa 29.13 (Greek version)
41Mk 7:8 For you ignore God's law and substitute your own tradition." 
41Mk 7:9 Then he said, "You skillfully sidestep God's law in order to hold on to your own tradition.
41Mk 7:10 For instance, Moses gave you this law from God£∫ `Honor your father and mother,'®Á and `Anyone who speaks disrespectfully of father or mother must be put to death.'®Ë / ®ÁExod 20.12; Deut 5.16 ®ËExod 21.17 (Greek version); Lev 20.9 (Greek version)
41Mk 7:11 But you say it is all right for people to say to their parents, `Sorry, I can't help you. For I have vowed to give to God what I would have given to you.'®Á / ®ÁGreek `What I would have given to you is Corban' (that is, a gift)
41Mk 7:12 In this way, you let them disregard their needy parents.
41Mk 7:13 And so you cancel the word of God in order to hand down your own tradition. And this is only one example among many others."
41Mk 7:14 Then Jesus called to the crowd to come and hear. "All of you listen," he said, "and try to understand.
41Mk 7:15 It's not what goes into your body that defiles you; you are defiled by what comes from your heart."
41Mk 7:16 ®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts add verse 16, Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand. Compare 4.9, 23
41Mk 7:17 Then Jesus went into a house to get away from the crowd, and his disciples asked him what he meant by the parable he had just used.
41Mk 7:18 "Don't you understand either?" he asked. "Can't you see that the food you put into your body cannot defile you?
41Mk 7:19 Food doesn't go into your heart, but only passes through the stomach and then goes into the sewer." ®Á / ®ÁBy saying this, he declared that every kind of food is acceptable in God's eyes
41Mk 7:20 And then he added, "It is what comes from inside that defiles you.
41Mk 7:21 For from within, out of a person's heart, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder,
41Mk 7:22 adultery, greed, wickedness, deceit, lustful desires, envy, slander, pride, and foolishness.
41Mk 7:23 All these vile things come from within; they are what defile you."
41Mk 7:24 Then Jesus left Galilee and went north to the region of Tyre®Á. He didn't want anyone to know which house he was staying in, but he couldn't keep it a secret. / ®ÁSome manuscripts add and Sidon
41Mk 7:25 Right away a woman who had heard about him came and fell at his feet. Her little girl was possessed by an evil®Á spirit, / ®ÁGreek unclean
41Mk 7:26 and she begged him to cast out the demon from her daughter. Since she was a Gentile, born in Syrian Phoenicia,
41Mk 7:27 Jesus told her, "First I should feed the children?my own family, the Jews®Á. It isn't right to take food from the children and throw it to the dogs." / ®ÁGreek Let the children eat first
41Mk 7:28 She replied, "That's true, Lord, but even the dogs under the table are allowed to eat the scraps from the children's plates."
41Mk 7:29 "Good answer!" he said. "Now go home, for the demon has left your daughter."
41Mk 7:30 And when she arrived home, she found her little girl lying quietly in bed, and the demon was gone.
41Mk 7:31 Jesus left Tyre and went up to Sidon before going back to the Sea of Galilee and the region of the Ten Towns®Á. / ®ÁGreek Decapolis
41Mk 7:32 A deaf man with a speech impediment was brought to him, and the people begged Jesus to lay his hands on the man to heal him.
41Mk 7:33 Jesus led him away from the crowd so they could be alone. He put his fingers into the man's ears. Then, spitting on his own fingers, he touched the man's tongue.
41Mk 7:34 Looking up to heaven, he sighed and said, "Ephphatha," which means, "Be opened!"
41Mk 7:35 Instantly the man could hear perfectly, and his tongue was freed so he could speak plainly!
41Mk 7:36 Jesus told the crowd not to tell anyone, but the more he told them not to, the more they spread the news.
41Mk 7:37 They were completely amazed and said again and again, "Everything he does is wonderful. He even makes the deaf to hear and gives speech to those who cannot speak."
41Mk 8:1 About this time another large crowd had gathered, and the people ran out of food again. Jesus called his disciples and told them,
41Mk 8:2 "I feel sorry for these people. They have been here with me for three days, and they have nothing left to eat.
41Mk 8:3 If I send them home hungry, they will faint along the way. For some of them have come a long distance."
41Mk 8:4 His disciples replied, "How are we supposed to find enough food to feed them out here in the wilderness?"
41Mk 8:5 Jesus asked, "How much bread do you have?" "Seven loaves," they replied.
41Mk 8:6 So Jesus told all the people to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves, thanked God for them, and broke them into pieces. He gave them to his disciples, who distributed the bread to the crowd.
41Mk 8:7 A few small fish were found, too, so Jesus also blessed these and told the disciples to distribute them.
41Mk 8:8 They ate as much as they wanted. Afterward, the disciples picked up seven large baskets of leftover food.
41Mk 8:9 There were about 4,000 people in the crowd that day, and Jesus sent them home after they had eaten.
41Mk 8:10 Immediately after this, he got into a boat with his disciples and crossed over to the region of Dalmanutha.
41Mk 8:11 When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had arrived, they came and started to argue with him. Testing him, they demanded that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority.
41Mk 8:12 When he heard this, he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, "Why do these people keep demanding a miraculous sign? I tell you the truth, I will not give this generation any such sign."
41Mk 8:13 So he got back into the boat and left them, and he crossed to the other side of the lake.
41Mk 8:14 But the disciples had forgotten to bring any food. They had only one loaf of bread with them in the boat.
41Mk 8:15 As they were crossing the lake, Jesus warned them, "Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and of Herod."
41Mk 8:16 At this they began to argue with each other because they hadn't brought any bread.
41Mk 8:17 Jesus knew what they were saying, so he said, "Why are you arguing about having no bread? Don't you know or understand even yet? Are your hearts too hard to take it in?
41Mk 8:18 `You have eyes?can't you see? You have ears?can't you hear?'®Á Don't you remember anything at all? / ®ÁJer 5.21
41Mk 8:19 When I fed the 5,000 with five loaves of bread, how many baskets of leftovers did you pick up afterward?" "Twelve," they said.
41Mk 8:20 "And when I fed the 4,000 with seven loaves, how many large baskets of leftovers did you pick up?" "Seven," they said.
41Mk 8:21 "Don't you understand yet?" he asked them.
41Mk 8:22 When they arrived at Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus, and they begged him to touch the man and heal him.
41Mk 8:23 Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. Then, spitting on the man's eyes, he laid his hands on him and asked, "Can you see anything now?"
41Mk 8:24 The man looked around. "Yes," he said, "I see people, but I can't see them very clearly. They look like trees walking around."
41Mk 8:25 Then Jesus placed his hands on the man's eyes again, and his eyes were opened. His sight was completely restored, and he could see everything clearly.
41Mk 8:26 Jesus sent him away, saying, "Don't go back into the village on your way home."
41Mk 8:27 Jesus and his disciples left Galilee and went up to the villages near Caesarea Philippi. As they were walking along, he asked them, "Who do people say I am?"
41Mk 8:28 "Well," they replied, "some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say you are one of the other prophets."
41Mk 8:29 Then he asked them, "But who do you say I am?" Peter replied, "You are the Messiah®Á." / ®ÁOr the Christ. Messiah (a Hebrew term) and Christ (a Greek term) both mean "the anointed one."
41Mk 8:30 But Jesus warned them not to tell anyone about him.
41Mk 8:31 Then Jesus began to tell them that the Son of Man®Á must suffer many terrible things and be rejected by the elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of religious law. He would be killed, but three days later he would rise from the dead. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
41Mk 8:32 As he talked about this openly with his disciples, Peter took him aside and began to reprimand him for saying such things®Á. / ®ÁOr began to correct him
41Mk 8:33 Jesus turned around and looked at his disciples, then reprimanded Peter. "Get away from me, Satan!" he said. "You are seeing things merely from a human point of view, not from God's."
41Mk 8:34 Then, calling the crowd to join his disciples, he said, "If any of you wants to be my follower, you must turn from your selfish ways, take up your cross, and follow me.
41Mk 8:35 If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake and for the sake of the Good News, you will save it.
41Mk 8:36 And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but lose your own soul?®Á / ®ÁOr your self? also in 8.37
41Mk 8:37 Is anything worth more than your soul?
41Mk 8:38 If anyone is ashamed of me and my message in these adulterous and sinful days, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in the glory of his Father with the holy angels."
41Mk 9:1 Jesus went on to say, "I tell you the truth, some standing here right now will not die before they see the Kingdom of God arrive in great power!"
41Mk 9:2 Six days later Jesus took Peter, James, and John, and led them up a high mountain to be alone. As the men watched, Jesus' appearance was transformed,
41Mk 9:3 and his clothes became dazzling white, far whiter than any earthly bleach could ever make them.
41Mk 9:4 Then Elijah and Moses appeared and began talking with Jesus.
41Mk 9:5 Peter exclaimed, "Rabbi, it's wonderful for us to be here! Let's make three shelters as memorials®Á - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." / ®ÁGreek three tabernacles
41Mk 9:6 He said this because he didn't really know what else to say, for they were all terrified.
41Mk 9:7 Then a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, "This is my dearly loved Son. Listen to him."
41Mk 9:8 Suddenly, when they looked around, Moses and Elijah were gone, and they saw only Jesus with them.
41Mk 9:9 As they went back down the mountain, he told them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man®Á had risen from the dead. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
41Mk 9:10 So they kept it to themselves, but they often asked each other what he meant by "rising from the dead."
41Mk 9:11 Then they asked him, "Why do the teachers of religious law insist that Elijah must return before the Messiah comes?®Á" / ®ÁGreek that Elijah must come first?
41Mk 9:12 Jesus responded, "Elijah is indeed coming first to get everything ready. Yet why do the Scriptures say that the Son of Man must suffer greatly and be treated with utter contempt?
41Mk 9:13 But I tell you, Elijah has already come, and they chose to abuse him, just as the Scriptures predicted."
41Mk 9:14 When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd surrounding them, and some teachers of religious law were arguing with them.
41Mk 9:15 When the crowd saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with awe, and they ran to greet him.
41Mk 9:16 "What is all this arguing about?" Jesus asked.
41Mk 9:17 One of the men in the crowd spoke up and said, "Teacher, I brought my son so you could heal him. He is possessed by an evil spirit that won't let him talk.
41Mk 9:18 And whenever this spirit seizes him, it throws him violently to the ground. Then he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid®Á. So I asked your disciples to cast out the evil spirit, but they couldn't do it." / ®ÁOr becomes weak
41Mk 9:19 Jesus said to them®Á, "You faithless people! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me." / ®ÁOr said to his disciples
41Mk 9:20 So they brought the boy. But when the evil spirit saw Jesus, it threw the child into a violent convulsion, and he fell to the ground, writhing and foaming at the mouth.
41Mk 9:21 "How long has this been happening?" Jesus asked the boy's father. He replied, "Since he was a little boy.
41Mk 9:22 The spirit often throws him into the fire or into water, trying to kill him. Have mercy on us and help us, if you can."
41Mk 9:23 "What do you mean, `If I can'?" Jesus asked. "Anything is possible if a person believes."
41Mk 9:24 The father instantly cried out, "I do believe, but help me overcome my unbelief!"
41Mk 9:25 When Jesus saw that the crowd of onlookers was growing, he rebuked the evil®Á spirit. "Listen, you spirit that makes this boy unable to hear and speak," he said. "I command you to come out of this child and never enter him again!" / ®ÁGreek unclean
41Mk 9:26 Then the spirit screamed and threw the boy into another violent convulsion and left him. The boy appeared to be dead. A murmur ran through the crowd as people said, "He's dead."
41Mk 9:27 But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.
41Mk 9:28 Afterward, when Jesus was alone in the house with his disciples, they asked him, "Why couldn't we cast out that evil spirit?"
41Mk 9:29 Jesus replied, "This kind can be cast out only by prayer®Á." / ®ÁSome manuscripts read by prayer and fasting
41Mk 9:30 Leaving that region, they traveled through Galilee. Jesus didn't want anyone to know he was there,
41Mk 9:31 for he wanted to spend more time with his disciples and teach them. He said to them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies. He will be killed, but three days later he will rise from the dead."
41Mk 9:32 They didn't understand what he was saying, however, and they were afraid to ask him what he meant.
41Mk 9:33 After they arrived at Capernaum and settled in a house, Jesus asked his disciples, "What were you discussing out on the road?"
41Mk 9:34 But they didn't answer, because they had been arguing about which of them was the greatest.
41Mk 9:35 He sat down, called the twelve disciples over to him, and said, "Whoever wants to be first must take last place and be the servant of everyone else."
41Mk 9:36 Then he put a little child among them. Taking the child in his arms, he said to them,
41Mk 9:37 "Anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf®Á welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me welcomes not only me but also my Father who sent me." / ®ÁGreek in my name
41Mk 9:38 John said to Jesus, "Teacher, we saw someone using your name to cast out demons, but we told him to stop because he wasn't in our group."
41Mk 9:39 "Don't stop him!" Jesus said. "No one who performs a miracle in my name will soon be able to speak evil of me.
41Mk 9:40 Anyone who is not against us is for us.
41Mk 9:41 If anyone gives you even a cup of water because you belong to the Messiah, I tell you the truth, that person will surely be rewarded.
41Mk 9:42 "But if you cause one of these little ones who trusts in me to fall into sin, it would be better for you to be thrown into the sea with a large millstone hung around your neck.
41Mk 9:43 If your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It's better to enter eternal life with only one hand than to go into the unquenchable fires of hell®Á with two hands. / ®ÁGreek Gehenna; also in 9.45, 47
41Mk 9:44 ®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts add verse 44, `where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out.' See 9.48
41Mk 9:45 If your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It's better to enter eternal life with only one foot than to be thrown into hell with two feet.
41Mk 9:46 ®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts add verse 46, `where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out.' See 9.48
41Mk 9:47 And if your eye causes you to sin, gouge it out. It's better to enter the Kingdom of God with only one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell,
41Mk 9:48 `where the maggots never die and the fire never goes out.'®Á / ®ÁIsa 66.24
41Mk 9:49 "For everyone will be tested with fire®Á. / ®ÁGreek salted with fire; other manuscripts add and every sacrifice will be salted with salt
41Mk 9:50 Salt is good for seasoning. But if it loses its flavor, how do you make it salty again? You must have the qualities of salt among yourselves and live in peace with each other."
41Mk 10:1 Then Jesus left Capernaum and went down to the region of Judea and into the area east of the Jordan River. Once again crowds gathered around him, and as usual he was teaching them.
41Mk 10:2 Some Pharisees came and tried to trap him with this question£∫ "Should a man be allowed to divorce his wife?"
41Mk 10:3 Jesus answered them with a question£∫ "What did Moses say in the law about divorce?"
41Mk 10:4 "Well, he permitted it," they replied. "He said a man can give his wife a written notice of divorce and send her away."®Á / ®ÁSee Deut 24.1
41Mk 10:5 But Jesus responded, "He wrote this commandment only as a concession to your hard hearts.
41Mk 10:6 But `God made them male and female'®Á from the beginning of creation. / ®ÁGen 1.27; 5.2
41Mk 10:7 `This explains why a man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife®Á, / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include and is joined to his wife
41Mk 10:8 and the two are united into one.'®Á Since they are no longer two but one, / ®ÁGen 2.24
41Mk 10:9 let no one split apart what God has joined together."
41Mk 10:10 Later, when he was alone with his disciples in the house, they brought up the subject again.
41Mk 10:11 He told them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery against her.
41Mk 10:12 And if a woman divorces her husband and marries someone else, she commits adultery."
41Mk 10:13 One day some parents brought their children to Jesus so he could touch and bless them. But the disciples scolded the parents for bothering him.
41Mk 10:14 When Jesus saw what was happening, he was angry with his disciples. He said to them, "Let the children come to me. Don't stop them! For the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like these children.
41Mk 10:15 I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it."
41Mk 10:16 Then he took the children in his arms and placed his hands on their heads and blessed them.
41Mk 10:17 As Jesus was starting out on his way to Jerusalem, a man came running up to him, knelt down, and asked, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?"
41Mk 10:18 "Why do you call me good?" Jesus asked. "Only God is truly good.
41Mk 10:19 But to answer your question, you know the commandments£∫ `You must not murder. You must not commit adultery. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely. You must not cheat anyone. Honor your father and mother.'®Á" / ®ÁExod 20.12-16; Deut 5.16-20
41Mk 10:20 "Teacher," the man replied, "I've obeyed all these commandments since I was young."
41Mk 10:21 Looking at the man, Jesus felt genuine love for him. "There is still one thing you haven't done," he told him. "Go and sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
41Mk 10:22 At this the man's face fell, and he went away sad, for he had many possessions.
41Mk 10:23 Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God!"
41Mk 10:24 This amazed them. But Jesus said again, "Dear children, it is very hard®Á to enter the Kingdom of God. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read very hard for those who trust in riches
41Mk 10:25 In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!"
41Mk 10:26 The disciples were astounded. "Then who in the world can be saved?" they asked.
41Mk 10:27 Jesus looked at them intently and said, "Humanly speaking, it is impossible. But not with God. Everything is possible with God."
41Mk 10:28 Then Peter began to speak up. "We've given up everything to follow you," he said.
41Mk 10:29 "Yes," Jesus replied, "and I assure you that everyone who has given up house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or property, for my sake and for the Good News,
41Mk 10:30 will receive now in return a hundred times as many houses, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and property?along with persecution. And in the world to come that person will have eternal life.
41Mk 10:31 But many who are the greatest now will be least important then, and those who seem least important now will be the greatest then®Á." / ®ÁGreek But many who are first will be last; and the last, first
41Mk 10:32 They were now on the way up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. The disciples were filled with awe, and the people following behind were overwhelmed with fear. Taking the twelve disciples aside, Jesus once more began to describe everything that was about to happen to him.
41Mk 10:33 "Listen," he said, "we're going up to Jerusalem, where the Son of Man®Á will be betrayed to the leading priests and the teachers of religious law. They will sentence him to die and hand him over to the Romans®Ë. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself ®ËGreek the Gentiles
41Mk 10:34 They will mock him, spit on him, flog him with a whip, and kill him, but after three days he will rise again."
41Mk 10:35 Then James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came over and spoke to him. "Teacher," they said, "we want you to do us a favor."
41Mk 10:36 "What is your request?" he asked.
41Mk 10:37 They replied, "When you sit on your glorious throne, we want to sit in places of honor next to you, one on your right and the other on your left."
41Mk 10:38 But Jesus said to them, "You don't know what you are asking! Are you able to drink from the bitter cup of suffering I am about to drink? Are you able to be baptized with the baptism of suffering I must be baptized with?"
41Mk 10:39 "Oh yes," they replied, "we are able!" Then Jesus told them, "You will indeed drink from my bitter cup and be baptized with my baptism of suffering.
41Mk 10:40 But I have no right to say who will sit on my right or my left. God has prepared those places for the ones he has chosen."
41Mk 10:41 When the ten other disciples heard what James and John had asked, they were indignant.
41Mk 10:42 So Jesus called them together and said, "You know that the rulers in this world lord it over their people, and officials flaunt their authority over those under them.
41Mk 10:43 But among you it will be different. Whoever wants to be a leader among you must be your servant,
41Mk 10:44 and whoever wants to be first among you must be the slave of everyone else.
41Mk 10:45 For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve others and to give his life as a ransom for many."
41Mk 10:46 Then they reached Jericho, and as Jesus and his disciples left town, a large crowd followed him. A blind beggar named Bartimaeus ®Á was sitting beside the road. / ®Áson of Timaeus
41Mk 10:47 When Bartimaeus heard that Jesus of Nazareth was nearby, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
41Mk 10:48 "Be quiet!" many of the people yelled at him. But he only shouted louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
41Mk 10:49 When Jesus heard him, he stopped and said, "Tell him to come here." So they called the blind man. "Cheer up," they said. "Come on, he's calling you!"
41Mk 10:50 Bartimaeus threw aside his coat, jumped up, and came to Jesus.
41Mk 10:51 "What do you want me to do for you?" Jesus asked. "My rabbi®Á," the blind man said, "I want to see!" / ®ÁGreek uses the Hebrew term Rabboni
41Mk 10:52 And Jesus said to him, "Go, for your faith has healed you." Instantly the man could see, and he followed Jesus down the road®Á. / ®ÁOr on the way
41Mk 11:1 As Jesus and his disciples approached Jerusalem, they came to the towns of Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives. Jesus sent two of them on ahead.
41Mk 11:2 "Go into that village over there," he told them. "As soon as you enter it, you will see a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
41Mk 11:3 If anyone asks, `What are you doing?' just say, `The Lord needs it and will return it soon.'"
41Mk 11:4 The two disciples left and found the colt standing in the street, tied outside the front door.
41Mk 11:5 As they were untying it, some bystanders demanded, "What are you doing, untying that colt?"
41Mk 11:6 They said what Jesus had told them to say, and they were permitted to take it.
41Mk 11:7 Then they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments over it, and he sat on it.
41Mk 11:8 Many in the crowd spread their garments on the road ahead of him, and others spread leafy branches they had cut in the fields.
41Mk 11:9 Jesus was in the center of the procession, and the people all around him were shouting, "Praise God!®Á Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the LORD! / ®ÁGreek Hosanna, an exclamation of praise that literally means "save now"; also in 11.10
41Mk 11:10 Blessings on the coming Kingdom of our ancestor David! Praise God in highest heaven!"®Á / ®ÁPss 118.25-26; 148.1
41Mk 11:11 So Jesus came to Jerusalem and went into the Temple. After looking around carefully at everything, he left because it was late in the afternoon. Then he returned to Bethany with the twelve disciples.
41Mk 11:12 The next morning as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus was hungry.
41Mk 11:13 He noticed a fig tree in full leaf a little way off, so he went over to see if he could find any figs. But there were only leaves because it was too early in the season for fruit.
41Mk 11:14 Then Jesus said to the tree, "May no one ever eat your fruit again!" And the disciples heard him say it.
41Mk 11:15 When they arrived back in Jerusalem, Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out the people buying and selling animals for sacrifices. He knocked over the tables of the money changers and the chairs of those selling doves,
41Mk 11:16 and he stopped everyone from using the Temple as a marketplace®Á. / ®ÁOr from carrying merchandise through the Temple
41Mk 11:17 He said to them, "The Scriptures declare, `My Temple will be called a house of prayer for all nations,' but you have turned it into a den of thieves."®Á / ®ÁIsa 56.7; Jer 7.11
41Mk 11:18 When the leading priests and teachers of religious law heard what Jesus had done, they began planning how to kill him. But they were afraid of him because the people were so amazed at his teaching.
41Mk 11:19 That evening Jesus and the disciples left®Á the city. / ®ÁGreek they left; other manuscripts read he left
41Mk 11:20 The next morning as they passed by the fig tree he had cursed, the disciples noticed it had withered from the roots up.
41Mk 11:21 Peter remembered what Jesus had said to the tree on the previous day and exclaimed, "Look, Rabbi! The fig tree you cursed has withered and died!"
41Mk 11:22 Then Jesus said to the disciples, "Have faith in God.
41Mk 11:23 I tell you the truth, you can say to this mountain, `May you be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' and it will happen. But you must really believe it will happen and have no doubt in your heart.
41Mk 11:24 I tell you, you can pray for anything, and if you believe that you've received it, it will be yours.
41Mk 11:25 But when you are praying, first forgive anyone you are holding a grudge against, so that your Father in heaven will forgive your sins, too."
41Mk 11:26 ®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts add verse 26, But if you refuse to forgive, your Father in heaven will not forgive your sins. Compare Matt 6.15
41Mk 11:27 Again they entered Jerusalem. As Jesus was walking through the Temple area, the leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders came up to him.
41Mk 11:28 They demanded, "By what authority are you doing all these things? Who gave you the right to do them?"
41Mk 11:29 "I'll tell you by what authority I do these things if you answer one question," Jesus replied.
41Mk 11:30 "Did John's authority to baptize come from heaven, or was it merely human? Answer me!"
41Mk 11:31 They talked it over among themselves. "If we say it was from heaven, he will ask why we didn't believe John.
41Mk 11:32 But do we dare say it was merely human?" For they were afraid of what the people would do, because everyone believed that John was a prophet.
41Mk 11:33 So they finally replied, "We don't know." And Jesus responded, "Then I won't tell you by what authority I do these things."
41Mk 12:1 Then Jesus began teaching them with stories£∫ "A man planted a vineyard. He built a wall around it, dug a pit for pressing out the grape juice, and built a lookout tower. Then he leased the vineyard to tenant farmers and moved to another country.
41Mk 12:2 At the time of the grape harvest, he sent one of his servants to collect his share of the crop.
41Mk 12:3 But the farmers grabbed the servant, beat him up, and sent him back empty-handed.
41Mk 12:4 The owner then sent another servant, but they insulted him and beat him over the head.
41Mk 12:5 The next servant he sent was killed. Others he sent were either beaten or killed,
41Mk 12:6 until there was only one left?his son whom he loved dearly. The owner finally sent him, thinking, `Surely they will respect my son.'
41Mk 12:7 "But the tenant farmers said to one another, `Here comes the heir to this estate. Let's kill him and get the estate for ourselves!'
41Mk 12:8 So they grabbed him and murdered him and threw his body out of the vineyard.
41Mk 12:9 "What do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do?" Jesus asked. "I'll tell you?he will come and kill those farmers and lease the vineyard to others.
41Mk 12:10 Didn't you ever read this in the Scriptures? `The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone.
41Mk 12:11 This is the LORD's doing, and it is wonderful to see.'®Á" / ®ÁPs 118.22-23
41Mk 12:12 The religious leaders®Á wanted to arrest Jesus because they realized he was telling the story against them - they were the wicked farmers. But they were afraid of the crowd, so they left him and went away. / ®ÁGreek They
41Mk 12:13 Later the leaders sent some Pharisees and supporters of Herod to trap Jesus into saying something for which he could be arrested.
41Mk 12:14 "Teacher," they said, "we know how honest you are. You are impartial and don't play favorites. You teach the way of God truthfully. Now tell us?is it right to pay taxes to Caesar or not?
41Mk 12:15 Should we pay them, or shouldn't we?" Jesus saw through their hypocrisy and said, "Why are you trying to trap me? Show me a Roman coin®Á, and I'll tell you." / ®ÁGreek a denarius
41Mk 12:16 When they handed it to him, he asked, "Whose picture and title are stamped on it?" "Caesar's," they replied.
41Mk 12:17 "Well, then," Jesus said, "give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God." His reply completely amazed them.
41Mk 12:18 Then Jesus was approached by some Sadducees?religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead. They posed this question.
41Mk 12:19 "Teacher, Moses gave us a law that if a man dies, leaving a wife without children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother's name®Á. / ®ÁSee Deut 25.5-6
41Mk 12:20 Well, suppose there were seven brothers. The oldest one married and then died without children.
41Mk 12:21 So the second brother married the widow, but he also died without children. Then the third brother married her.
41Mk 12:22 This continued with all seven of them, and still there were no children. Last of all, the woman also died.
41Mk 12:23 So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection? For all seven were married to her."
41Mk 12:24 Jesus replied, "Your mistake is that you don't know the Scriptures, and you don't know the power of God.
41Mk 12:25 For when the dead rise, they will neither marry nor be given in marriage. In this respect they will be like the angels in heaven.
41Mk 12:26 "But now, as to whether the dead will be raised - haven't you ever read about this in the writings of Moses, in the story of the burning bush? Long after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had died, God said to Moses®Á, `I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'®Ë / ®ÁGreek in the story of the bush? God said to him ®ËExod 3.6
41Mk 12:27 So he is the God of the living, not the dead. You have made a serious error."
41Mk 12:28 One of the teachers of religious law was standing there listening to the debate. He realized that Jesus had answered well, so he asked, "Of all the commandments, which is the most important?"
41Mk 12:29 Jesus replied, "The most important commandment is this£∫ `Listen, O Israel! The LORD our God is the one and only LORD.
41Mk 12:30 And you must love the LORD your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your mind, and all your strength.'®Á / ®ÁDeut 6.4-5
41Mk 12:31 The second is equally important£∫ `Love your neighbor as yourself.'®Á No other commandment is greater than these." / ®ÁLev 19.18
41Mk 12:32 The teacher of religious law replied, "Well said, Teacher. You have spoken the truth by saying that there is only one God and no other.
41Mk 12:33 And I know it is important to love him with all my heart and all my understanding and all my strength, and to love my neighbor as myself. This is more important than to offer all of the burnt offerings and sacrifices required in the law."
41Mk 12:34 Realizing how much the man understood, Jesus said to him, "You are not far from the Kingdom of God." And after that, no one dared to ask him any more questions.
41Mk 12:35 Later, as Jesus was teaching the people in the Temple, he asked, "Why do the teachers of religious law claim that the Messiah is the son of David?
41Mk 12:36 For David himself, speaking under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, said, `The LORD said to my Lord, Sit in the place of honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies beneath your feet.'®Á / ®ÁPs 110.1
41Mk 12:37 Since David himself called the Messiah `my Lord,' how can the Messiah be his son?" The large crowd listened to him with great delight.
41Mk 12:38 Jesus also taught£∫ "Beware of these teachers of religious law! For they like to parade around in flowing robes and receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces.
41Mk 12:39 And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets.
41Mk 12:40 Yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this, they will be more severely punished."
41Mk 12:41 Jesus sat down near the collection box in the Temple and watched as the crowds dropped in their money. Many rich people put in large amounts.
41Mk 12:42 Then a poor widow came and dropped in two small coins®Á. / ®ÁGreek two lepta, which is a kodrantes [i.e., a quadrans]
41Mk 12:43 Jesus called his disciples to him and said, "I tell you the truth, this poor widow has given more than all the others who are making contributions.
41Mk 12:44 For they gave a tiny part of their surplus, but she, poor as she is, has given everything she had to live on."
41Mk 13:1 As Jesus was leaving the Temple that day, one of his disciples said, "Teacher, look at these magnificent buildings! Look at the impressive stones in the walls."
41Mk 13:2 Jesus replied, "Yes, look at these great buildings. But they will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!"
41Mk 13:3 Later, Jesus sat on the Mount of Olives across the valley from the Temple. Peter, James, John, and Andrew came to him privately and asked him,
41Mk 13:4 "Tell us, when will all this happen? What sign will show us that these things are about to be fulfilled?"
41Mk 13:5 Jesus replied, "Don't let anyone mislead you,
41Mk 13:6 for many will come in my name, claiming, `I am the Messiah.'®Á They will deceive many. / ®ÁGreek claiming, `I am.'
41Mk 13:7 And you will hear of wars and threats of wars, but don't panic. Yes, these things must take place, but the end won't follow immediately.
41Mk 13:8 Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in many parts of the world, as well as famines. But this is only the first of the birth pains, with more to come.
41Mk 13:9 "When these things begin to happen, watch out! You will be handed over to the local councils and beaten in the synagogues. You will stand trial before governors and kings because you are my followers. But this will be your opportunity to tell them about me®Á. / ®ÁOr But this will be your testimony against them
41Mk 13:10 For the Good News must first be preached to all nations®Á. / ®ÁOr all peoples
41Mk 13:11 But when you are arrested and stand trial, don't worry in advance about what to say. Just say what God tells you at that time, for it is not you who will be speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
41Mk 13:12 "A brother will betray his brother to death, a father will betray his own child, and children will rebel against their parents and cause them to be killed.
41Mk 13:13 And everyone will hate you because you are my followers®Á. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. / ®ÁGreek on account of my name
41Mk 13:14 "The day is coming when you will see the sacrilegious object that causes desecration®Á standing where he®Ë should not be." (Reader, pay attention!) "Then those in Judea must flee to the hills. / ®ÁGreek the abomination of desolation. See Dan 9.27; 11.31; 12.11 ®ËOr it
41Mk 13:15 A person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack.
41Mk 13:16 A person out in the field must not return even to get a coat.
41Mk 13:17 How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days.
41Mk 13:18 And pray that your flight will not be in winter.
41Mk 13:19 For there will be greater anguish in those days than at any time since God created the world. And it will never be so great again.
41Mk 13:20 In fact, unless the Lord shortens that time of calamity, not a single person will survive. But for the sake of his chosen ones he has shortened those days.
41Mk 13:21 "Then if anyone tells you, `Look, here is the Messiah,' or `There he is,' don't believe it.
41Mk 13:22 For false messiahs and false prophets will rise up and perform signs and wonders so as to deceive, if possible, even God's chosen ones.
41Mk 13:23 Watch out! I have warned you about this ahead of time!
41Mk 13:24 "At that time, after the anguish of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will give no light,
41Mk 13:25 the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken®Á. / ®ÁSee Isa 13.10; 34.4; Joel 2.10
41Mk 13:26 Then everyone will see the Son of Man®Á coming on the clouds with great power and glory®Ë. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself ®ËSee Dan 7.13
41Mk 13:27 And he will send out his angels to gather his chosen ones from all over the world®Á - from the farthest ends of the earth and heaven. / ®ÁGreek from the four winds
41Mk 13:28 "Now learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches bud and its leaves begin to sprout, you know that summer is near.
41Mk 13:29 In the same way, when you see all these things taking place, you can know that his return is very near, right at the door.
41Mk 13:30 I tell you the truth, this generation®Á will not pass from the scene before all these things take place. / ®ÁOr this age, or this nation
41Mk 13:31 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.
41Mk 13:32 "However, no one knows the day or hour when these things will happen, not even the angels in heaven or the Son himself. Only the Father knows.
41Mk 13:33 And since you don't know when that time will come, be on guard! Stay alert®Á! / ®ÁSome manuscripts add and pray
41Mk 13:34 "The coming of the Son of Man can be illustrated by the story of a man going on a long trip. When he left home, he gave each of his slaves instructions about the work they were to do, and he told the gatekeeper to watch for his return.
41Mk 13:35 You, too, must keep watch! For you don't know when the master of the household will return?in the evening, at midnight, before dawn, or at daybreak.
41Mk 13:36 Don't let him find you sleeping when he arrives without warning.
41Mk 13:37 I say to you what I say to everyone£∫ Watch for him!"
41Mk 14:1 It was now two days before Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The leading priests and the teachers of religious law were still looking for an opportunity to capture Jesus secretly and kill him.
41Mk 14:2 "But not during the Passover celebration," they agreed, "or the people may riot."
41Mk 14:3 Meanwhile, Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon, a man who had previously had leprosy. While he was eating®Á, a woman came in with a beautiful alabaster jar of expensive perfume made from essence of nard. She broke open the jar and poured the perfume over his head. / ®ÁOr reclining
41Mk 14:4 Some of those at the table were indignant. "Why waste such expensive perfume?" they asked.
41Mk 14:5 "It could have been sold for a year's wages®Á and the money given to the poor!" So they scolded her harshly. / ®ÁGreek for 300 denarii. A denarius was equivalent to a laborer's full day's wage
41Mk 14:6 But Jesus replied, "Leave her alone. Why criticize her for doing such a good thing to me?
41Mk 14:7 You will always have the poor among you, and you can help them whenever you want to. But you will not always have me.
41Mk 14:8 She has done what she could and has anointed my body for burial ahead of time.
41Mk 14:9 I tell you the truth, wherever the Good News is preached throughout the world, this woman's deed will be remembered and discussed."
41Mk 14:10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the leading priests to arrange to betray Jesus to them.
41Mk 14:11 They were delighted when they heard why he had come, and they promised to give him money. So he began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus.
41Mk 14:12 On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go to prepare the Passover meal for you?"
41Mk 14:13 So Jesus sent two of them into Jerusalem with these instructions£∫ "As you go into the city, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him.
41Mk 14:14 At the house he enters, say to the owner, `The Teacher asks£∫ Where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?'
41Mk 14:15 He will take you upstairs to a large room that is already set up. That is where you should prepare our meal."
41Mk 14:16 So the two disciples went into the city and found everything just as Jesus had said, and they prepared the Passover meal there.
41Mk 14:17 In the evening Jesus arrived with the twelve disciples®Á. / ®ÁGreek the Twelve
41Mk 14:18 As they were at the table®Á eating, Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, one of you eating with me here will betray me." / ®ÁOr As they reclined
41Mk 14:19 Greatly distressed, each one asked in turn, "Am I the one?"
41Mk 14:20 He replied, "It is one of you twelve who is eating from this bowl with me.
41Mk 14:21 For the Son of Man®Á must die, as the Scriptures declared long ago. But how terrible it will be for the one who betrays him. It would be far better for that man if he had never been born!" / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
41Mk 14:22 As they were eating, Jesus took some bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, "Take it, for this is my body."
41Mk 14:23 And he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. He gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
41Mk 14:24 And he said to them, "This is my blood, which confirms the covenant®Á between God and his people. It is poured out as a sacrifice for many. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read the new covenant
41Mk 14:25 I tell you the truth, I will not drink wine again until the day I drink it new in the Kingdom of God."
41Mk 14:26 Then they sang a hymn and went out to the Mount of Olives.
41Mk 14:27 On the way, Jesus told them, "All of you will desert me. For the Scriptures say, `God will strike®Á the Shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' / ®ÁGreek I will strike. Zech 13.7
41Mk 14:28 But after I am raised from the dead, I will go ahead of you to Galilee and meet you there."
41Mk 14:29 Peter said to him, "Even if everyone else deserts you, I never will."
41Mk 14:30 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, Peter?this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny three times that you even know me."
41Mk 14:31 "No!" Peter declared emphatically. "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!" And all the others vowed the same.
41Mk 14:32 They went to the olive grove called Gethsemane, and Jesus said, "Sit here while I go and pray."
41Mk 14:33 He took Peter, James, and John with him, and he became deeply troubled and distressed.
41Mk 14:34 He told them, "My soul is crushed with grief to the point of death. Stay here and keep watch with me."
41Mk 14:35 He went on a little farther and fell to the ground. He prayed that, if it were possible, the awful hour awaiting him might pass him by.
41Mk 14:36 "Abba, Father,"®Á he cried out, "everything is possible for you. Please take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine." / ®ÁAbba is an Aramaic term for "father"
41Mk 14:37 Then he returned and found the disciples asleep. He said to Peter, "Simon, are you asleep? Couldn't you watch with me even one hour?
41Mk 14:38 Keep watch and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation. For the spirit is willing, but the body is weak."
41Mk 14:39 Then Jesus left them again and prayed the same prayer as before.
41Mk 14:40 When he returned to them again, he found them sleeping, for they couldn't keep their eyes open. And they didn't know what to say.
41Mk 14:41 When he returned to them the third time, he said, "Go ahead and sleep. Have your rest. But no?the time has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners.
41Mk 14:42 Up, let's be going. Look, my betrayer is here!"
41Mk 14:43 And immediately, even as Jesus said this, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived with a crowd of men armed with swords and clubs. They had been sent by the leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders.
41Mk 14:44 The traitor, Judas, had given them a prearranged signal£∫ "You will know which one to arrest when I greet him with a kiss. Then you can take him away under guard."
41Mk 14:45 As soon as they arrived, Judas walked up to Jesus. "Rabbi!" he exclaimed, and gave him the kiss.
41Mk 14:46 Then the others grabbed Jesus and arrested him.
41Mk 14:47 But one of the men with Jesus pulled out his sword and struck the high priest's slave, slashing off his ear.
41Mk 14:48 Jesus asked them, "Am I some dangerous revolutionary, that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me?
41Mk 14:49 Why didn't you arrest me in the Temple? I was there among you teaching every day. But these things are happening to fulfill what the Scriptures say about me."
41Mk 14:50 Then all his disciples deserted him and ran away.
41Mk 14:51 One young man following behind was clothed only in a long linen shirt. When the mob tried to grab him,
41Mk 14:52 he slipped out of his shirt and ran away naked.
41Mk 14:53 They took Jesus to the high priest's home where the leading priests, the elders, and the teachers of religious law had gathered.
41Mk 14:54 Meanwhile, Peter followed him at a distance and went right into the high priest's courtyard. There he sat with the guards, warming himself by the fire.
41Mk 14:55 Inside, the leading priests and the entire high council®Á were trying to find evidence against Jesus, so they could put him to death. But they couldn't find any. / ®ÁGreek the Sanhedrin
41Mk 14:56 Many false witnesses spoke against him, but they contradicted each other.
41Mk 14:57 Finally, some men stood up and gave this false testimony.
41Mk 14:58 "We heard him say, `I will destroy this Temple made with human hands, and in three days I will build another, made without human hands.'"
41Mk 14:59 But even then they didn't get their stories straight!
41Mk 14:60 Then the high priest stood up before the others and asked Jesus, "Well, aren't you going to answer these charges? What do you have to say for yourself?"
41Mk 14:61 But Jesus was silent and made no reply. Then the high priest asked him, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?"
41Mk 14:62 Jesus said, "I AM®Á. And you will see the Son of Man seated in the place of power at God's right hand®Ë and coming on the clouds of heaven."®È / ®ÁOr The `I AM' is here; or I am the LORD. See Exod 3.14 ®ËGreek at the right hand of the power. See Ps 110.1 ®ÈSee Dan 7.13
41Mk 14:63 Then the high priest tore his clothing to show his horror and said, "Why do we need other witnesses?
41Mk 14:64 You have all heard his blasphemy. What is your verdict?" "Guilty!" they all cried. "He deserves to die!"
41Mk 14:65 Then some of them began to spit at him, and they blindfolded him and beat him with their fists. "Prophesy to us," they jeered. And the guards slapped him as they took him away.
41Mk 14:66 Meanwhile, Peter was in the courtyard below. One of the servant girls who worked for the high priest came by
41Mk 14:67 and noticed Peter warming himself at the fire. She looked at him closely and said, "You were one of those with Jesus of Nazareth®Á." / ®ÁOr Jesus the Nazarene
41Mk 14:68 But Peter denied it. "I don't know what you're talking about," he said, and he went out into the entryway. Just then, a rooster crowed®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include Just then, a rooster crowed
41Mk 14:69 When the servant girl saw him standing there, she began telling the others, "This man is definitely one of them!"
41Mk 14:70 But Peter denied it again. A little later some of the other bystanders confronted Peter and said, "You must be one of them, because you are a Galilean."
41Mk 14:71 Peter swore, "A curse on me if I'm lying?I don't know this man you're talking about!"
41Mk 14:72 And immediately the rooster crowed the second time. Suddenly, Jesus' words flashed through Peter's mind£∫ "Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny three times that you even know me." And he broke down and wept.
41Mk 15:1 Very early in the morning the leading priests, the elders, and the teachers of religious law?the entire high council®Á - met to discuss their next step. They bound Jesus, led him away, and took him to Pilate, the Roman governor. / ®ÁGreek the Sanhedrin; also in 15.43
41Mk 15:2 Pilate asked Jesus, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You have said it."
41Mk 15:3 Then the leading priests kept accusing him of many crimes,
41Mk 15:4 and Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to answer them? What about all these charges they are bringing against you?"
41Mk 15:5 But Jesus said nothing, much to Pilate's surprise.
41Mk 15:6 Now it was the governor's custom each year during the Passover celebration to release one prisoner?anyone the people requested.
41Mk 15:7 One of the prisoners at that time was Barabbas, a revolutionary who had committed murder in an uprising.
41Mk 15:8 The crowd went to Pilate and asked him to release a prisoner as usual.
41Mk 15:9 "Would you like me to release to you this `King of the Jews'?" Pilate asked.
41Mk 15:10 (For he realized by now that the leading priests had arrested Jesus out of envy.)
41Mk 15:11 But at this point the leading priests stirred up the crowd to demand the release of Barabbas instead of Jesus.
41Mk 15:12 Pilate asked them, "Then what should I do with this man you call the king of the Jews?"
41Mk 15:13 They shouted back, "Crucify him!"
41Mk 15:14 "Why?" Pilate demanded. "What crime has he committed?" But the mob roared even louder, "Crucify him!"
41Mk 15:15 So to pacify the crowd, Pilate released Barabbas to them. He ordered Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip, then turned him over to the Roman soldiers to be crucified.
41Mk 15:16 The soldiers took Jesus into the courtyard of the governor's headquarters®Á and called out the entire regiment. / ®Ácalled the Praetorium
41Mk 15:17 They dressed him in a purple robe, and they wove thorn branches into a crown and put it on his head.
41Mk 15:18 Then they saluted him and taunted, "Hail! King of the Jews!"
41Mk 15:19 And they struck him on the head with a reed stick, spit on him, and dropped to their knees in mock worship.
41Mk 15:20 When they were finally tired of mocking him, they took off the purple robe and put his own clothes on him again. Then they led him away to be crucified.
41Mk 15:21 A passerby named Simon, who was from Cyrene®Á, was coming in from the countryside just then, and the soldiers forced him to carry Jesus' cross. (Simon was the father of Alexander and Rufus.) / ®ÁCyrene was a city in northern Africa
41Mk 15:22 And they brought Jesus to a place called Golgotha (which means "Place of the Skull").
41Mk 15:23 They offered him wine drugged with myrrh, but he refused it.
41Mk 15:24 Then the soldiers nailed him to the cross. They divided his clothes and threw dice®Á to decide who would get each piece. / ®ÁGreek cast lots. See Ps 22.18
41Mk 15:25 It was nine o'clock in the morning when they crucified him.
41Mk 15:26 A sign was fastened to the cross, announcing the charge against him. It read, "The King of the Jews."
41Mk 15:27 Two revolutionaries®Á were crucified with him, one on his right and one on his left. / ®ÁOr Two criminals
41Mk 15:28 ®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts add verse 28, And the Scripture was fulfilled that said, "He was counted among those who were rebels." See Isa 53.12; also compare Luke 22.37
41Mk 15:29 The people passing by shouted abuse, shaking their heads in mockery. "Ha! Look at you now!" they yelled at him. "You said you were going to destroy the Temple and rebuild it in three days.
41Mk 15:30 Well then, save yourself and come down from the cross!"
41Mk 15:31 The leading priests and teachers of religious law also mocked Jesus. "He saved others," they scoffed, "but he can't save himself!
41Mk 15:32 Let this Messiah, this King of Israel, come down from the cross so we can see it and believe him!" Even the men who were crucified with Jesus ridiculed him.
41Mk 15:33 At noon, darkness fell across the whole land until three o'clock.
41Mk 15:34 Then at three o'clock Jesus called out with a loud voice, "Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani?" which means "My God, my God, why have you abandoned me?"®Á / ®ÁPs 22.1
41Mk 15:35 Some of the bystanders misunderstood and thought he was calling for the prophet Elijah.
41Mk 15:36 One of them ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, holding it up to him on a reed stick so he could drink. "Wait!" he said. "Let's see whether Elijah comes to take him down!"
41Mk 15:37 Then Jesus uttered another loud cry and breathed his last.
41Mk 15:38 And the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn in two, from top to bottom.
41Mk 15:39 When the Roman officer®Á who stood facing him®Ë saw how he had died, he exclaimed, "This man truly was the Son of God!" / ®ÁGreek the centurion; similarly in 15.44, 45 ®ËSome manuscripts add heard his cry and
41Mk 15:40 Some women were there, watching from a distance, including Mary Magdalene, Mary (the mother of James the younger and of Joseph®Á), and Salome. / ®ÁGreek Joses; also in 15.47. See Matt 27.56
41Mk 15:41 They had been followers of Jesus and had cared for him while he was in Galilee. Many other women who had come with him to Jerusalem were also there.
41Mk 15:42 This all happened on Friday, the day of preparation®Á, the day before the Sabbath. As evening approached, / ®ÁGreek It was the day of preparation
41Mk 15:43 Joseph of Arimathea took a risk and went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.®Á / ®ÁJoseph was an honored member of the high council, and he was waiting for the Kingdom of God to come
41Mk 15:44 Pilate couldn't believe that Jesus was already dead, so he called for the Roman officer and asked if he had died yet.
41Mk 15:45 The officer confirmed that Jesus was dead, so Pilate told Joseph he could have the body.
41Mk 15:46 Joseph bought a long sheet of linen cloth. Then he took Jesus' body down from the cross, wrapped it in the cloth, and laid it in a tomb that had been carved out of the rock. Then he rolled a stone in front of the entrance.
41Mk 15:47 Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph saw where Jesus' body was laid.
41Mk 16:1 Saturday evening, when the Sabbath ended, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome went out and purchased burial spices so they could anoint Jesus' body.
41Mk 16:2 Very early on Sunday morning®Á, just at sunrise, they went to the tomb. / ®ÁGreek on the first day of the week; also in 16.9
41Mk 16:3 On the way they were asking each other, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?"
41Mk 16:4 But as they arrived, they looked up and saw that the stone, which was very large, had already been rolled aside.
41Mk 16:5 When they entered the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a white robe sitting on the right side. The women were shocked,
41Mk 16:6 but the angel said, "Don't be alarmed. You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth®Á, who was crucified. He isn't here! He is risen from the dead! Look, this is where they laid his body. / ®ÁOr Jesus the Nazarene
41Mk 16:7 Now go and tell his disciples, including Peter, that Jesus is going ahead of you to Galilee. You will see him there, just as he told you before he died."
41Mk 16:8 The women fled from the tomb, trembling and bewildered, and they said nothing to anyone because they were too frightened®Á. [Shorter Ending of Mark] Then they briefly reported all this to Peter and his companions. Afterward Jesus himself sent them out from east to west with the sacred and unfailing message of salvation that gives eternal life. Amen. / ®ÁThe most reliable early manuscripts of the Gospel of Mark end at verse 8. Other manuscripts include various endings to the Gospel. A few include both the "shorter ending" and the "longer ending." The majority of manuscripts include the "longer ending" immediately after verse 8
41Mk 16:9 [Longer Ending of Mark] After Jesus rose from the dead early on Sunday morning, the first person who saw him was Mary Magdalene, the woman from whom he had cast out seven demons.
41Mk 16:10 She went to the disciples, who were grieving and weeping, and told them what had happened.
41Mk 16:11 But when she told them that Jesus was alive and she had seen him, they didn't believe her.
41Mk 16:12 Afterward he appeared in a different form to two of his followers who were walking from Jerusalem into the country.
41Mk 16:13 They rushed back to tell the others, but no one believed them.
41Mk 16:14 Still later he appeared to the eleven disciples as they were eating together. He rebuked them for their stubborn unbelief because they refused to believe those who had seen him after he had been raised from the dead®Á. / ®ÁSome early manuscripts add£∫ And they excused themselves, saying, "This age of lawlessness and unbelief is under Satan, who does not permit God's truth and power to conquer the evil [unclean] spirits. Therefore, reveal your justice now." This is what they said to Christ. And Christ replied to them, "The period of years of Satan's power has been fulfilled, but other dreadful things will happen soon. And I was handed over to death for those who have sinned, so that they may return to the truth and sin no more, and so they may inherit the spiritual, incorruptible, and righteous glory in heaven."
41Mk 16:15 And then he told them, "Go into all the world and preach the Good News to everyone.
41Mk 16:16 Anyone who believes and is baptized will be saved. But anyone who refuses to believe will be condemned.

41Mk 16:19 When the Lord Jesus had finished talking with them, he was taken up into heaven and sat down in the place of honor at God's right hand.
41Mk 16:20 And the disciples went everywhere and preached, and the Lord worked through them, confirming what they said by many miraculous signs.

42Lk 1:1 Many people have set out to write accounts about the events that have been fulfilled among us.
42Lk 1:2 They used the eyewitness reports circulating among us from the early disciples®Á. / ®ÁGreek from those who from the beginning were servants of the word
42Lk 1:3 Having carefully investigated everything from the beginning, I also have decided to write a careful account for you, most honorable Theophilus,
42Lk 1:4 so you can be certain of the truth of everything you were taught.
42Lk 1:5 When Herod was king of Judea, there was a Jewish priest named Zechariah. He was a member of the priestly order of Abijah, and his wife, Elizabeth, was also from the priestly line of Aaron.
42Lk 1:6 Zechariah and Elizabeth were righteous in God's eyes, careful to obey all of the Lord's commandments and regulations.
42Lk 1:7 They had no children because Elizabeth was unable to conceive, and they were both very old.
42Lk 1:8 One day Zechariah was serving God in the Temple, for his order was on duty that week.
42Lk 1:9 As was the custom of the priests, he was chosen by lot to enter the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense.
42Lk 1:10 While the incense was being burned, a great crowd stood outside, praying.
42Lk 1:11 While Zechariah was in the sanctuary, an angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing to the right of the incense altar.
42Lk 1:12 Zechariah was shaken and overwhelmed with fear when he saw him.
42Lk 1:13 But the angel said, "Don't be afraid, Zechariah! God has heard your prayer. Your wife, Elizabeth, will give you a son, and you are to name him John.
42Lk 1:14 You will have great joy and gladness, and many will rejoice at his birth,
42Lk 1:15 for he will be great in the eyes of the Lord. He must never touch wine or other alcoholic drinks. He will be filled with the Holy Spirit, even before his birth®Á. / ®ÁOr even from birth
42Lk 1:16 And he will turn many Israelites to the Lord their God.
42Lk 1:17 He will be a man with the spirit and power of Elijah. He will prepare the people for the coming of the Lord. He will turn the hearts of the fathers to their children®Á, and he will cause those who are rebellious to accept the wisdom of the godly." / ®ÁSee Mal 4.5-6
42Lk 1:18 Zechariah said to the angel, "How can I be sure this will happen? I'm an old man now, and my wife is also well along in years."
42Lk 1:19 Then the angel said, "I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. It was he who sent me to bring you this good news!
42Lk 1:20 But now, since you didn't believe what I said, you will be silent and unable to speak until the child is born. For my words will certainly be fulfilled at the proper time."
42Lk 1:21 Meanwhile, the people were waiting for Zechariah to come out of the sanctuary, wondering why he was taking so long.
42Lk 1:22 When he finally did come out, he couldn't speak to them. Then they realized from his gestures and his silence that he must have seen a vision in the sanctuary.
42Lk 1:23 When Zechariah's week of service in the Temple was over, he returned home.
42Lk 1:24 Soon afterward his wife, Elizabeth, became pregnant and went into seclusion for five months.
42Lk 1:25 "How kind the Lord is!" she exclaimed. "He has taken away my disgrace of having no children."
42Lk 1:26 In the sixth month of Elizabeth's pregnancy, God sent the angel Gabriel to Nazareth, a village in Galilee,
42Lk 1:27 to a virgin named Mary. She was engaged to be married to a man named Joseph, a descendant of King David.
42Lk 1:28 Gabriel appeared to her and said, "Greetings, favored woman! The Lord is with you!®Á" / ®ÁSome manuscripts add Blessed are you among women
42Lk 1:29 Confused and disturbed, Mary tried to think what the angel could mean.
42Lk 1:30 "Don't be afraid, Mary," the angel told her, "for you have found favor with God!
42Lk 1:31 You will conceive and give birth to a son, and you will name him Jesus.
42Lk 1:32 He will be very great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David.
42Lk 1:33 And he will reign over Israel®Á forever; his Kingdom will never end!" / ®ÁGreek over the house of Jacob
42Lk 1:34 Mary asked the angel, "But how can this happen? I am a virgin."
42Lk 1:35 The angel replied, "The Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you. So the baby to be born will be holy, and he will be called the Son of God.
42Lk 1:36 What's more, your relative Elizabeth has become pregnant in her old age! People used to say she was barren, but she's now in her sixth month.
42Lk 1:37 For nothing is impossible with God®Á." / ®ÁSome manuscripts read For the word of God will never fail
42Lk 1:38 Mary responded, "I am the Lord's servant. May everything you have said about me come true." And then the angel left her.
42Lk 1:39 A few days later Mary hurried to the hill country of Judea, to the town
42Lk 1:40 where Zechariah lived. She entered the house and greeted Elizabeth.
42Lk 1:41 At the sound of Mary's greeting, Elizabeth's child leaped within her, and Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit.
42Lk 1:42 Elizabeth gave a glad cry and exclaimed to Mary, "God has blessed you above all women, and your child is blessed.
42Lk 1:43 Why am I so honored, that the mother of my Lord should visit me?
42Lk 1:44 When I heard your greeting, the baby in my womb jumped for joy.
42Lk 1:45 You are blessed because you believed that the Lord would do what he said."
42Lk 1:46 Mary responded, "Oh, how my soul praises the Lord.
42Lk 1:47 How my spirit rejoices in God my Savior!
42Lk 1:48 For he took notice of his lowly servant girl, and from now on all generations will call me blessed.
42Lk 1:49 For the Mighty One is holy, and he has done great things for me.
42Lk 1:50 He shows mercy from generation to generation to all who fear him.
42Lk 1:51 His mighty arm has done tremendous things! He has scattered the proud and haughty ones.
42Lk 1:52 He has brought down princes from their thrones and exalted the humble.
42Lk 1:53 He has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away with empty hands.
42Lk 1:54 He has helped his servant Israel and remembered to be merciful.
42Lk 1:55 For he made this promise to our ancestors, to Abraham and his children forever."
42Lk 1:56 Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back to her own home.
42Lk 1:57 When it was time for Elizabeth's baby to be born, she gave birth to a son.
42Lk 1:58 And when her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had been very merciful to her, everyone rejoiced with her.
42Lk 1:59 When the baby was eight days old, they all came for the circumcision ceremony. They wanted to name him Zechariah, after his father.
42Lk 1:60 But Elizabeth said, "No! His name is John!"
42Lk 1:61 "What?" they exclaimed. "There is no one in all your family by that name."
42Lk 1:62 So they used gestures to ask the baby's father what he wanted to name him.
42Lk 1:63 He motioned for a writing tablet, and to everyone's surprise he wrote, "His name is John."
42Lk 1:64 Instantly Zechariah could speak again, and he began praising God.
42Lk 1:65 Awe fell upon the whole neighborhood, and the news of what had happened spread throughout the Judean hills.
42Lk 1:66 Everyone who heard about it reflected on these events and asked, "What will this child turn out to be?" For the hand of the Lord was surely upon him in a special way.
42Lk 1:67 Then his father, Zechariah, was filled with the Holy Spirit and gave this prophecy.
42Lk 1:68 "Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, because he has visited and redeemed his people.
42Lk 1:69 He has sent us a mighty Savior®Á from the royal line of his servant David, / ®ÁGreek has raised up a horn of salvation for us
42Lk 1:70 just as he promised through his holy prophets long ago.
42Lk 1:71 Now we will be saved from our enemies and from all who hate us.
42Lk 1:72 He has been merciful to our ancestors by remembering his sacred covenant?
42Lk 1:73 the covenant he swore with an oath to our ancestor Abraham.
42Lk 1:74 We have been rescued from our enemies so we can serve God without fear,
42Lk 1:75 in holiness and righteousness for as long as we live.
42Lk 1:76 "And you, my little son, will be called the prophet of the Most High, because you will prepare the way for the Lord.
42Lk 1:77 You will tell his people how to find salvation through forgiveness of their sins. 
42Lk 1:78 Because of God's tender mercy, the morning light from heaven is about to break upon us®Á, / ®ÁOr the Morning Light from Heaven is about to visit us
42Lk 1:79 to give light to those who sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, and to guide us to the path of peace."
42Lk 1:80 John grew up and became strong in spirit. And he lived in the wilderness until he began his public ministry to Israel.
42Lk 2:1 At that time the Roman emperor, Augustus, decreed that a census should be taken throughout the Roman Empire.
42Lk 2:2 (This was the first census taken when Quirinius was governor of Syria)
42Lk 2:3 All returned to their own ancestral towns to register for this census.
42Lk 2:4 And because Joseph was a descendant of King David, he had to go to Bethlehem in Judea, David's ancient home. He traveled there from the village of Nazareth in Galilee.
42Lk 2:5 He took with him Mary, his fiancee, who was now obviously pregnant.
42Lk 2:6 And while they were there, the time came for her baby to be born.
42Lk 2:7 She gave birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him snugly in strips of cloth and laid him in a manger, because there was no lodging available for them.
42Lk 2:8 That night there were shepherds staying in the fields nearby, guarding their flocks of sheep.
42Lk 2:9 Suddenly, an angel of the Lord appeared among them, and the radiance of the Lord's glory surrounded them. They were terrified,
42Lk 2:10 but the angel reassured them. "Don't be afraid!" he said. "I bring you good news that will bring great joy to all people.
42Lk 2:11 The Savior?yes, the Messiah, the Lord?has been born today in Bethlehem, the city of David!
42Lk 2:12 And you will recognize him by this sign£∫ You will find a baby wrapped snugly in strips of cloth, lying in a manger."
42Lk 2:13 Suddenly, the angel was joined by a vast host of others?the armies of heaven?praising God and saying,
42Lk 2:14 "Glory to God in highest heaven, and peace on earth to those with whom God is pleased."
42Lk 2:15 When the angels had returned to heaven, the shepherds said to each other, "Let's go to Bethlehem! Let's see this thing that has happened, which the Lord has told us about."
42Lk 2:16 They hurried to the village and found Mary and Joseph. And there was the baby, lying in the manger.
42Lk 2:17 After seeing him, the shepherds told everyone what had happened and what the angel had said to them about this child.
42Lk 2:18 All who heard the shepherds' story were astonished,
42Lk 2:19 but Mary kept all these things in her heart and thought about them often.
42Lk 2:20 The shepherds went back to their flocks, glorifying and praising God for all they had heard and seen. It was just as the angel had told them.
42Lk 2:21 Eight days later, when the baby was circumcised, he was named Jesus, the name given him by the angel even before he was conceived.
42Lk 2:22 Then it was time for their purification offering, as required by the law of Moses after the birth of a child; so his parents took him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.
42Lk 2:23 The law of the Lord says, "If a woman's first child is a boy, he must be dedicated to the LORD."®Á / ®ÁExod 13.2
42Lk 2:24 So they offered the sacrifice required in the law of the Lord?"either a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons."®Á / ®ÁLev 12.8
42Lk 2:25 At that time there was a man in Jerusalem named Simeon. He was righteous and devout and was eagerly waiting for the Messiah to come and rescue Israel. The Holy Spirit was upon him
42Lk 2:26 and had revealed to him that he would not die until he had seen the Lord's Messiah.
42Lk 2:27 That day the Spirit led him to the Temple. So when Mary and Joseph came to present the baby Jesus to the Lord as the law required,
42Lk 2:28 Simeon was there. He took the child in his arms and praised God, saying,
42Lk 2:29 "Sovereign Lord, now let your servant die in peace, as you have promised.
42Lk 2:30 I have seen your salvation,
42Lk 2:31 which you have prepared for all people.
42Lk 2:32 He is a light to reveal God to the nations, and he is the glory of your people Israel!"
42Lk 2:33 Jesus' parents were amazed at what was being said about him.
42Lk 2:34 Then Simeon blessed them, and he said to Mary, the baby's mother, "This child is destined to cause many in Israel to fall, but he will be a joy to many others. He has been sent as a sign from God, but many will oppose him.
42Lk 2:35 As a result, the deepest thoughts of many hearts will be revealed. And a sword will pierce your very soul."
42Lk 2:36 Anna, a prophet, was also there in the Temple. She was the daughter of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher, and she was very old. Her husband died when they had been married only seven years.
42Lk 2:37 Then she lived as a widow to the age of eighty-four®Á. She never left the Temple but stayed there day and night, worshiping God with fasting and prayer. / ®ÁOr She had been a widow for eighty-four years
42Lk 2:38 She came along just as Simeon was talking with Mary and Joseph, and she began praising God. She talked about the child to everyone who had been waiting expectantly for God to rescue Jerusalem.
42Lk 2:39 When Jesus' parents had fulfilled all the requirements of the law of the Lord, they returned home to Nazareth in Galilee.
42Lk 2:40 There the child grew up healthy and strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God's favor was on him.
42Lk 2:41 Every year Jesus' parents went to Jerusalem for the Passover festival.
42Lk 2:42 When Jesus was twelve years old, they attended the festival as usual.
42Lk 2:43 After the celebration was over, they started home to Nazareth, but Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem. His parents didn't miss him at first,
42Lk 2:44 because they assumed he was among the other travelers. But when he didn't show up that evening, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends.
42Lk 2:45 When they couldn't find him, they went back to Jerusalem to search for him there.
42Lk 2:46 Three days later they finally discovered him in the Temple, sitting among the religious teachers, listening to them and asking questions.
42Lk 2:47 All who heard him were amazed at his understanding and his answers.
42Lk 2:48 His parents didn't know what to think. "Son," his mother said to him, "why have you done this to us? Your father and I have been frantic, searching for you everywhere."
42Lk 2:49 "But why did you need to search?" he asked. "Didn't you know that I must be in my Father's house?"®Á / ®ÁOr "Didn't you realize that I should be involved with my Father's affairs?"
42Lk 2:50 But they didn't understand what he meant.
42Lk 2:51 Then he returned to Nazareth with them and was obedient to them. And his mother stored all these things in her heart.
42Lk 2:52 Jesus grew in wisdom and in stature and in favor with God and all the people.
42Lk 3:1 It was now the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius, the Roman emperor. Pontius Pilate was governor over Judea; Herod Antipas was ruler®Á over Galilee; his brother Philip was ruler®Ë over Iturea and Traconitis; Lysanias was ruler®È over Abilene. / ®ÁGreek Herod was tetrarch. Herod Antipas was a son of King Herod ®ËGreek tetrarch ®ÈGreek tetrarch
42Lk 3:2 Annas and Caiaphas were the high priests. At this time a message from God came to John son of Zechariah, who was living in the wilderness.
42Lk 3:3 Then John went from place to place on both sides of the Jordan River, preaching that people should be baptized to show that they had repented of their sins and turned to God to be forgiven.
42Lk 3:4 Isaiah had spoken of John when he said, "He is a voice shouting in the wilderness, `Prepare the way for the LORD's coming! Clear the road for him!
42Lk 3:5 The valleys will be filled, and the mountains and hills made level. The curves will be straightened, and the rough places made smooth.
42Lk 3:6 And then all people will see the salvation sent from God.'"®Á / ®ÁIsa 40.3-5 (Greek version)
42Lk 3:7 When the crowds came to John for baptism, he said, "You brood of snakes! Who warned you to flee God's coming wrath?
42Lk 3:8 Prove by the way you live that you have repented of your sins and turned to God. Don't just say to each other, `We're safe, for we are descendants of Abraham.' That means nothing, for I tell you, God can create children of Abraham from these very stones.
42Lk 3:9 Even now the ax of God's judgment is poised, ready to sever the roots of the trees. Yes, every tree that does not produce good fruit will be chopped down and thrown into the fire."
42Lk 3:10 The crowds asked, "What should we do?"
42Lk 3:11 John replied, "If you have two shirts, give one to the poor. If you have food, share it with those who are hungry."
42Lk 3:12 Even corrupt tax collectors came to be baptized and asked, "Teacher, what should we do?"
42Lk 3:13 He replied, "Collect no more taxes than the government requires."
42Lk 3:14 "What should we do?" asked some soldiers. John replied, "Don't extort money or make false accusations. And be content with your pay."
42Lk 3:15 Everyone was expecting the Messiah to come soon, and they were eager to know whether John might be the Messiah.
42Lk 3:16 John answered their questions by saying, "I baptize you with®Á water; but someone is coming soon who is greater than I am?so much greater that I'm not even worthy to be his slave and untie the straps of his sandals. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire®Ë. / ®ÁOr in ®ËOr in the Holy Spirit and in fire
42Lk 3:17 He is ready to separate the chaff from the wheat with his winnowing fork. Then he will clean up the threshing area, gathering the wheat into his barn but burning the chaff with never-ending fire."
42Lk 3:18 John used many such warnings as he announced the Good News to the people.
42Lk 3:19 John also publicly criticized Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee®Á, for marrying Herodias, his brother's wife, and for many other wrongs he had done. / ®ÁGreek Herod the tetrarch
42Lk 3:20 So Herod put John in prison, adding this sin to his many others.
42Lk 3:21 One day when the crowds were being baptized, Jesus himself was baptized. As he was praying, the heavens opened,
42Lk 3:22 and the Holy Spirit, in bodily form, descended on him like a dove. And a voice from heaven said, "You are my dearly loved Son, and you bring me great joy®Á." / ®ÁSome manuscripts read my Son, and today I have become your Father

42Lk 4:2 where he was tempted by the devil for forty days. Jesus ate nothing all that time and became very hungry.
42Lk 4:3 Then the devil said to him, "If you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread."
42Lk 4:4 But Jesus told him, "No! The Scriptures say, `People do not live by bread alone.'®Á" / ®ÁDeut 8.3
42Lk 4:5 Then the devil took him up and revealed to him all the kingdoms of the world in a moment of time.

42Lk 4:8 Jesus replied, "The Scriptures say, `You must worship the LORD your God and serve only him.'®Á" / ®ÁDeut 6.13

42Lk 4:11 And they will hold you up with their hands so you won't even hurt your foot on a stone.'®Á" / ®ÁPs 91.11-12
42Lk 4:12 Jesus responded, "The Scriptures also say, `You must not test the LORD your God.'®Á" / ®ÁDeut 6.16
42Lk 4:13 When the devil had finished tempting Jesus, he left him until the next opportunity came.
42Lk 4:14 Then Jesus returned to Galilee, filled with the Holy Spirit's power. Reports about him spread quickly through the whole region.
42Lk 4:15 He taught regularly in their synagogues and was praised by everyone.
42Lk 4:16 When he came to the village of Nazareth, his boyhood home, he went as usual to the synagogue on the Sabbath and stood up to read the Scriptures.
42Lk 4:17 The scroll of Isaiah the prophet was handed to him. He unrolled the scroll and found the place where this was written.
42Lk 4:18 "The Spirit of the LORD is upon me, for he has anointed me to bring Good News to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim that captives will be released, that the blind will see, that the oppressed will be set free,
42Lk 4:19 and that the time of the LORD's favor has come®Á." / ®ÁOr and to proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD. Isa 61.1-2 (Greek version); 58.6
42Lk 4:20 He rolled up the scroll, handed it back to the attendant, and sat down. All eyes in the synagogue looked at him intently.
42Lk 4:21 Then he began to speak to them. "The Scripture you've just heard has been fulfilled this very day!"
42Lk 4:22 Everyone spoke well of him and was amazed by the gracious words that came from his lips. "How can this be?" they asked. "Isn't this Joseph's son?"
42Lk 4:23 Then he said, "You will undoubtedly quote me this proverb£∫ `Physician, heal yourself'?meaning, `Do miracles here in your hometown like those you did in Capernaum.'
42Lk 4:24 But I tell you the truth, no prophet is accepted in his own hometown.
42Lk 4:25 "Certainly there were many needy widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when the heavens were closed for three and a half years, and a severe famine devastated the land.
42Lk 4:26 Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them. He was sent instead to a foreigner?a widow of Zarephath in the land of Sidon.
42Lk 4:27 And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of the prophet Elisha, but the only one healed was Naaman, a Syrian."
42Lk 4:28 When they heard this, the people in the synagogue were furious.
42Lk 4:29 Jumping up, they mobbed him and forced him to the edge of the hill on which the town was built. They intended to push him over the cliff,
42Lk 4:30 but he passed right through the crowd and went on his way.
42Lk 4:31 Then Jesus went to Capernaum, a town in Galilee, and taught there in the synagogue every Sabbath day.
42Lk 4:32 There, too, the people were amazed at his teaching, for he spoke with authority.
42Lk 4:33 Once when he was in the synagogue, a man possessed by a demon - an evil®Á spirit - began shouting at Jesus, / ®ÁGreek unclean; also in 4.36
42Lk 4:34 "Go away! Why are you interfering with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are?the Holy One sent from God!"
42Lk 4:35 Jesus cut him short. "Be quiet! Come out of the man," he ordered. At that, the demon threw the man to the floor as the crowd watched; then it came out of him without hurting him further.
42Lk 4:36 Amazed, the people exclaimed, "What authority and power this man's words possess! Even evil spirits obey him, and they flee at his command!"
42Lk 4:37 The news about Jesus spread through every village in the entire region.
42Lk 4:38 After leaving the synagogue that day, Jesus went to Simon's home, where he found Simon's mother-in-law very sick with a high fever. "Please heal her," everyone begged.
42Lk 4:39 Standing at her bedside, he rebuked the fever, and it left her. And she got up at once and prepared a meal for them.
42Lk 4:40 As the sun went down that evening, people throughout the village brought sick family members to Jesus. No matter what their diseases were, the touch of his hand healed every one.
42Lk 4:41 Many were possessed by demons; and the demons came out at his command, shouting, "You are the Son of God!" But because they knew he was the Messiah, he rebuked them and refused to let them speak.
42Lk 4:42 Early the next morning Jesus went out to an isolated place. The crowds searched everywhere for him, and when they finally found him, they begged him not to leave them.
42Lk 4:43 But he replied, "I must preach the Good News of the Kingdom of God in other towns, too, because that is why I was sent."
42Lk 4:44 So he continued to travel around, preaching in synagogues throughout Judea®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read Galilee
42Lk 5:1 One day as Jesus was preaching on the shore of the Sea of Galilee®Á, great crowds pressed in on him to listen to the word of God. / ®ÁGreek Lake Gennesaret, another name for the Sea of Galilee
42Lk 5:2 He noticed two empty boats at the water's edge, for the fishermen had left them and were washing their nets.
42Lk 5:3 Stepping into one of the boats, Jesus asked Simon®Á, its owner, to push it out into the water. So he sat in the boat and taught the crowds from there. / ®ÁSimon is called "Peter" in 6.14 and thereafter
42Lk 5:4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Now go out where it is deeper, and let down your nets to catch some fish."
42Lk 5:5 "Master," Simon replied, "we worked hard all last night and didn't catch a thing. But if you say so, I'll let the nets down again."
42Lk 5:6 And this time their nets were so full of fish they began to tear!
42Lk 5:7 A shout for help brought their partners in the other boat, and soon both boats were filled with fish and on the verge of sinking.
42Lk 5:8 When Simon Peter realized what had happened, he fell to his knees before Jesus and said, "Oh, Lord, please leave me?I'm too much of a sinner to be around you."
42Lk 5:9 For he was awestruck by the number of fish they had caught, as were the others with him.
42Lk 5:10 His partners, James and John, the sons of Zebedee, were also amazed. Jesus replied to Simon, "Don't be afraid! From now on you'll be fishing for people!"
42Lk 5:11 And as soon as they landed, they left everything and followed Jesus.
42Lk 5:12 In one of the villages, Jesus met a man with an advanced case of leprosy. When the man saw Jesus, he bowed with his face to the ground, begging to be healed. "Lord," he said, "if you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean."
42Lk 5:13 Jesus reached out and touched him. "I am willing," he said. "Be healed!" And instantly the leprosy disappeared.
42Lk 5:14 Then Jesus instructed him not to tell anyone what had happened. He said, "Go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy®Á. This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed." / ®ÁSee Lev 14.2-32
42Lk 5:15 But despite Jesus' instructions, the report of his power spread even faster, and vast crowds came to hear him preach and to be healed of their diseases.
42Lk 5:16 But Jesus often withdrew to the wilderness for prayer.
42Lk 5:17 One day while Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and teachers of religious law were sitting nearby. ®Á And the Lord's healing power was strongly with Jesus. / ®ÁIt seemed that these men showed up from every village in all Galilee and Judea, as well as from Jerusalem
42Lk 5:18 Some men came carrying a paralyzed man on a sleeping mat. They tried to take him inside to Jesus,
42Lk 5:19 but they couldn't reach him because of the crowd. So they went up to the roof and took off some tiles. Then they lowered the sick man on his mat down into the crowd, right in front of Jesus.
42Lk 5:20 Seeing their faith, Jesus said to the man, "Young man, your sins are forgiven."
42Lk 5:21 But the Pharisees and teachers of religious law said to themselves, "Who does he think he is? That's blasphemy! Only God can forgive sins!"
42Lk 5:22 Jesus knew what they were thinking, so he asked them, "Why do you question this in your hearts?
42Lk 5:23 Is it easier to say `Your sins are forgiven,' or `Stand up and walk'?
42Lk 5:24 So I will prove to you that the Son of Man®Á has the authority on earth to forgive sins." Then Jesus turned to the paralyzed man and said, "Stand up, pick up your mat, and go home!" / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
42Lk 5:25 And immediately, as everyone watched, the man jumped up, picked up his mat, and went home praising God.
42Lk 5:26 Everyone was gripped with great wonder and awe, and they praised God, exclaiming, "We have seen amazing things today!"
42Lk 5:27 Later, as Jesus left the town, he saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at his tax collector's booth. "Follow me and be my disciple," Jesus said to him.
42Lk 5:28 So Levi got up, left everything, and followed him.
42Lk 5:29 Later, Levi held a banquet in his home with Jesus as the guest of honor. Many of Levi's fellow tax collectors and other guests also ate with them.
42Lk 5:30 But the Pharisees and their teachers of religious law complained bitterly to Jesus' disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with such scum?®Á" / ®ÁGreek with tax collectors and sinners?
42Lk 5:31 Jesus answered them, "Healthy people don't need a doctor?sick people do.
42Lk 5:32 I have come to call not those who think they are righteous, but those who know they are sinners and need to repent."
42Lk 5:33 One day some people said to Jesus, "John the Baptist's disciples fast and pray regularly, and so do the disciples of the Pharisees. Why are your disciples always eating and drinking?"
42Lk 5:34 Jesus responded, "Do wedding guests fast while celebrating with the groom? Of course not.
42Lk 5:35 But someday the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast."
42Lk 5:36 Then Jesus gave them this illustration£∫ "No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and uses it to patch an old garment. For then the new garment would be ruined, and the new patch wouldn't even match the old garment.
42Lk 5:37 "And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. For the new wine would burst the wineskins, spilling the wine and ruining the skins.
42Lk 5:38 New wine must be stored in new wineskins.
42Lk 5:39 But no one who drinks the old wine seems to want the new wine. `The old is just fine,' they say."
42Lk 6:1 One Sabbath day as Jesus was walking through some grainfields, his disciples broke off heads of grain, rubbed off the husks in their hands, and ate the grain.
42Lk 6:2 But some Pharisees said, "Why are you breaking the law by harvesting grain on the Sabbath?"
42Lk 6:3 Jesus replied, "Haven't you read in the Scriptures what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
42Lk 6:4 He went into the house of God and broke the law by eating the sacred loaves of bread that only the priests can eat. He also gave some to his companions."
42Lk 6:5 And Jesus added, "The Son of Man®Á is Lord, even over the Sabbath." / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
42Lk 6:6 On another Sabbath day, a man with a deformed right hand was in the synagogue while Jesus was teaching.
42Lk 6:7 The teachers of religious law and the Pharisees watched Jesus closely. If he healed the man's hand, they planned to accuse him of working on the Sabbath.
42Lk 6:8 But Jesus knew their thoughts. He said to the man with the deformed hand, "Come and stand in front of everyone." So the man came forward.
42Lk 6:9 Then Jesus said to his critics, "I have a question for you. Does the law permit good deeds on the Sabbath, or is it a day for doing evil? Is this a day to save life or to destroy it?"
42Lk 6:10 He looked around at them one by one and then said to the man, "Hold out your hand." So the man held out his hand, and it was restored!
42Lk 6:11 At this, the enemies of Jesus were wild with rage and began to discuss what to do with him.
42Lk 6:12 One day soon afterward Jesus went up on a mountain to pray, and he prayed to God all night.
42Lk 6:13 At daybreak he called together all of his disciples and chose twelve of them to be apostles. Here are their names.
42Lk 6:14 Simon (whom he named Peter), Andrew (Peter's brother), James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,
42Lk 6:15 Matthew, Thomas, James (son of Alphaeus), Simon (who was called the zealot),
42Lk 6:16 Judas (son of James), Judas Iscariot (who later betrayed him). 
42Lk 6:17 When they came down from the mountain, the disciples stood with Jesus on a large, level area, surrounded by many of his followers and by the crowds. There were people from all over Judea and from Jerusalem and from as far north as the seacoasts of Tyre and Sidon.
42Lk 6:18 They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases; and those troubled by evil®Á spirits were healed. / ®ÁGreek unclean
42Lk 6:19 Everyone tried to touch him, because healing power went out from him, and he healed everyone.
42Lk 6:20 Then Jesus turned to his disciples and said, "God blesses you who are poor, for the Kingdom of God is yours.
42Lk 6:21 God blesses you who are hungry now, for you will be satisfied. God blesses you who weep now, for in due time you will laugh.
42Lk 6:22 What blessings await you when people hate you and exclude you and mock you and curse you as evil because you follow the Son of Man.
42Lk 6:23 When that happens, be happy! Yes, leap for joy! For a great reward awaits you in heaven. And remember, their ancestors treated the ancient prophets that same way.
42Lk 6:24 "What sorrow awaits you who are rich, for you have your only happiness now.
42Lk 6:25 What sorrow awaits you who are fat and prosperous now, for a time of awful hunger awaits you. What sorrow awaits you who laugh now, for your laughing will turn to mourning and sorrow.
42Lk 6:26 What sorrow awaits you who are praised by the crowds, for their ancestors also praised false prophets.
42Lk 6:27 "But to you who are willing to listen, I say, love your enemies! Do good to those who hate you.
42Lk 6:28 Bless those who curse you. Pray for those who hurt you.
42Lk 6:29 If someone slaps you on one cheek, offer the other cheek also. If someone demands your coat, offer your shirt also.
42Lk 6:30 Give to anyone who asks; and when things are taken away from you, don't try to get them back.
42Lk 6:31 Do to others as you would like them to do to you.
42Lk 6:32 "If you love only those who love you, why should you get credit for that? Even sinners love those who love them!
42Lk 6:33 And if you do good only to those who do good to you, why should you get credit? Even sinners do that much!
42Lk 6:34 And if you lend money only to those who can repay you, why should you get credit? Even sinners will lend to other sinners for a full return.
42Lk 6:35 "Love your enemies! Do good to them. Lend to them without expecting to be repaid. Then your reward from heaven will be very great, and you will truly be acting as children of the Most High, for he is kind to those who are unthankful and wicked.
42Lk 6:36 You must be compassionate, just as your Father is compassionate.
42Lk 6:37 "Do not judge others, and you will not be judged. Do not condemn others, or it will all come back against you. Forgive others, and you will be forgiven.
42Lk 6:38 Give, and you will receive. Your gift will return to you in full?pressed down, shaken together to make room for more, running over, and poured into your lap. The amount you give will determine the amount you get back®Á." / ®ÁOr The measure you give will be the measure you get back
42Lk 6:39 Then Jesus gave the following illustration£∫ "Can one blind person lead another? Won't they both fall into a ditch?
42Lk 6:40 Students®Á are not greater than their teacher. But the student who is fully trained will become like the teacher. / ®ÁOr Disciples
42Lk 6:41 "And why worry about a speck in your friend's eye®Á when you have a log in your own? / ®ÁGreek your brother's eye; also in 6.42
42Lk 6:42 How can you think of saying, `Friend®Á, let me help you get rid of that speck in your eye,' when you can't see past the log in your own eye? Hypocrite! First get rid of the log in your own eye; then you will see well enough to deal with the speck in your friend's eye. / ®ÁGreek Brother
42Lk 6:43 "A good tree can't produce bad fruit, and a bad tree can't produce good fruit.
42Lk 6:44 A tree is identified by its fruit. Figs are never gathered from thornbushes, and grapes are not picked from bramble bushes.
42Lk 6:45 A good person produces good things from the treasury of a good heart, and an evil person produces evil things from the treasury of an evil heart. What you say flows from what is in your heart.
42Lk 6:46 "So why do you keep calling me `Lord, Lord!' when you don't do what I say?
42Lk 6:47 I will show you what it's like when someone comes to me, listens to my teaching, and then follows it.
42Lk 6:48 It is like a person building a house who digs deep and lays the foundation on solid rock. When the floodwaters rise and break against that house, it stands firm because it is well built.
42Lk 6:49 But anyone who hears and doesn't obey is like a person who builds a house without a foundation. When the floods sweep down against that house, it will collapse into a heap of ruins."
42Lk 7:1 When Jesus had finished saying all this to the people, he returned to Capernaum.
42Lk 7:2 At that time the highly valued slave of a Roman officer®Á was sick and near death. / ®ÁGreek a centurion; similarly in 7.6
42Lk 7:3 When the officer heard about Jesus, he sent some respected Jewish elders to ask him to come and heal his slave.
42Lk 7:4 So they earnestly begged Jesus to help the man. "If anyone deserves your help, he does," they said,
42Lk 7:5 "for he loves the Jewish people and even built a synagogue for us."
42Lk 7:6 So Jesus went with them. But just before they arrived at the house, the officer sent some friends to say, "Lord, don't trouble yourself by coming to my home, for I am not worthy of such an honor.
42Lk 7:7 I am not even worthy to come and meet you. Just say the word from where you are, and my servant will be healed.
42Lk 7:8 I know this because I am under the authority of my superior officers, and I have authority over my soldiers. I only need to say, `Go,' and they go, or `Come,' and they come. And if I say to my slaves, `Do this,' they do it."
42Lk 7:9 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said, "I tell you, I haven't seen faith like this in all Israel!"
42Lk 7:10 And when the officer's friends returned to his house, they found the slave completely healed.
42Lk 7:11 Soon afterward Jesus went with his disciples to the village of Nain, and a large crowd followed him.
42Lk 7:12 A funeral procession was coming out as he approached the village gate. The young man who had died was a widow's only son, and a large crowd from the village was with her.
42Lk 7:13 When the Lord saw her, his heart overflowed with compassion. "Don't cry!" he said.
42Lk 7:14 Then he walked over to the coffin and touched it, and the bearers stopped. "Young man," he said, "I tell you, get up."
42Lk 7:15 Then the dead boy sat up and began to talk! And Jesus gave him back to his mother.
42Lk 7:16 Great fear swept the crowd, and they praised God, saying, "A mighty prophet has risen among us," and "God has visited his people today."
42Lk 7:17 And the news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and the surrounding countryside.
42Lk 7:18 The disciples of John the Baptist told John about everything Jesus was doing. So John called for two of his disciples,
42Lk 7:19 and he sent them to the Lord to ask him, "Are you the Messiah we've been expecting®Á, or should we keep looking for someone else?" / ®ÁGreek Are you the one who is coming? Also in 7.20
42Lk 7:20 John's two disciples found Jesus and said to him, "John the Baptist sent us to ask, `Are you the Messiah we've been expecting, or should we keep looking for someone else?'"
42Lk 7:21 At that very time, Jesus cured many people of their diseases, illnesses, and evil spirits, and he restored sight to many who were blind.
42Lk 7:22 Then he told John's disciples, "Go back to John and tell him what you have seen and heard?the blind see, the lame walk, the lepers are cured, the deaf hear, the dead are raised to life, and the Good News is being preached to the poor.
42Lk 7:23 And tell him, `God blesses those who do not turn away because of me®Á.'" / ®ÁOr who are not offended by me
42Lk 7:24 After John's disciples left, Jesus began talking about him to the crowds. "What kind of man did you go into the wilderness to see? Was he a weak reed, swayed by every breath of wind?
42Lk 7:25 Or were you expecting to see a man dressed in expensive clothes? No, people who wear beautiful clothes and live in luxury are found in palaces.
42Lk 7:26 Were you looking for a prophet? Yes, and he is more than a prophet.
42Lk 7:27 John is the man to whom the Scriptures refer when they say, `Look, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, and he will prepare your way before you.'®Á / ®ÁMal 3.1
42Lk 7:28 I tell you, of all who have ever lived, none is greater than John. Yet even the least person in the Kingdom of God is greater than he is!"
42Lk 7:29 When they heard this, all the people?even the tax collectors?agreed that God's way was right®Á, for they had been baptized by John. / ®ÁOr praised God for his justice
42Lk 7:30 But the Pharisees and experts in religious law rejected God's plan for them, for they had refused John's baptism.
42Lk 7:31 "To what can I compare the people of this generation?" Jesus asked. "How can I describe them?
42Lk 7:32 They are like children playing a game in the public square. They complain to their friends, `We played wedding songs, and you didn't dance, so we played funeral songs, and you didn't weep.'
42Lk 7:33 For John the Baptist didn't spend his time eating bread or drinking wine, and you say, `He's possessed by a demon.'
42Lk 7:34 The Son of Man®Á, on the other hand, feasts and drinks, and you say, `He's a glutton and a drunkard, and a friend of tax collectors and other sinners!' / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
42Lk 7:35 But wisdom is shown to be right by the lives of those who follow it®Á." / ®ÁOr But wisdom is justified by all her children
42Lk 7:36 One of the Pharisees asked Jesus to have dinner with him, so Jesus went to his home and sat down to eat®Á. / ®ÁOr and reclined
42Lk 7:37 When a certain immoral woman from that city heard he was eating there, she brought a beautiful alabaster jar filled with expensive perfume.
42Lk 7:38 Then she knelt behind him at his feet, weeping. Her tears fell on his feet, and she wiped them off with her hair. Then she kept kissing his feet and putting perfume on them.
42Lk 7:39 When the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would know what kind of woman is touching him. She's a sinner!"
42Lk 7:40 Then Jesus answered his thoughts. "Simon," he said to the Pharisee, "I have something to say to you." "Go ahead, Teacher," Simon replied.
42Lk 7:41 Then Jesus told him this story£∫ "A man loaned money to two people?500 pieces of silver®Á to one and 50 pieces to the other. / ®ÁGreek 500 denarii. A denarius was equivalent to a laborer's full day's wage
42Lk 7:42 But neither of them could repay him, so he kindly forgave them both, canceling their debts. Who do you suppose loved him more after that?"
42Lk 7:43 Simon answered, "I suppose the one for whom he canceled the larger debt." "That's right," Jesus said.
42Lk 7:44 Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, "Look at this woman kneeling here. When I entered your home, you didn't offer me water to wash the dust from my feet, but she has washed them with her tears and wiped them with her hair.
42Lk 7:45 You didn't greet me with a kiss, but from the time I first came in, she has not stopped kissing my feet.
42Lk 7:46 You neglected the courtesy of olive oil to anoint my head, but she has anointed my feet with rare perfume.
42Lk 7:47 "I tell you, her sins?and they are many?have been forgiven, so she has shown me much love. But a person who is forgiven little shows only little love."
42Lk 7:48 Then Jesus said to the woman, "Your sins are forgiven."
42Lk 7:49 The men at the table said among themselves, "Who is this man, that he goes around forgiving sins?"
42Lk 7:50 And Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith has saved you; go in peace."
42Lk 8:1 Soon afterward Jesus began a tour of the nearby towns and villages, preaching and announcing the Good News about the Kingdom of God. He took his twelve disciples with him,
42Lk 8:2 along with some women who had been cured of evil spirits and diseases. Among them were Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons;
42Lk 8:3 Joanna, the wife of Chuza, Herod's business manager; Susanna; and many others who were contributing their own resources to support Jesus and his disciples.
42Lk 8:4 One day Jesus told a story in the form of a parable to a large crowd that had gathered from many towns to hear him.
42Lk 8:5 "A farmer went out to plant his seed. As he scattered it across his field, some seed fell on a footpath, where it was stepped on, and the birds ate it.
42Lk 8:6 Other seed fell among rocks. It began to grow, but the plant soon wilted and died for lack of moisture.
42Lk 8:7 Other seed fell among thorns that grew up with it and choked out the tender plants.
42Lk 8:8 Still other seed fell on fertile soil. This seed grew and produced a crop that was a hundred times as much as had been planted!" When he had said this, he called out, "Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand."
42Lk 8:9 His disciples asked him what this parable meant.
42Lk 8:10 He replied, "You are permitted to understand the secrets®Á of the Kingdom of God. But I use parables to teach the others so that the Scriptures might be fulfilled£∫ `When they look, they won't really see. When they hear, they won't understand.'®Ë / ®ÁGreek mysteries ®ËIsa 6.9 (Greek version)
42Lk 8:11 "This is the meaning of the parable£∫ The seed is God's word.
42Lk 8:12 The seeds that fell on the footpath represent those who hear the message, only to have the devil come and take it away from their hearts and prevent them from believing and being saved.
42Lk 8:13 The seeds on the rocky soil represent those who hear the message and receive it with joy. But since they don't have deep roots, they believe for a while, then they fall away when they face temptation.
42Lk 8:14 The seeds that fell among the thorns represent those who hear the message, but all too quickly the message is crowded out by the cares and riches and pleasures of this life. And so they never grow into maturity.
42Lk 8:15 And the seeds that fell on the good soil represent honest, good-hearted people who hear God's word, cling to it, and patiently produce a huge harvest.
42Lk 8:16 "No one lights a lamp and then covers it with a bowl or hides it under a bed. A lamp is placed on a stand, where its light can be seen by all who enter the house.
42Lk 8:17 For all that is secret will eventually be brought into the open, and everything that is concealed will be brought to light and made known to all.
42Lk 8:18 "So pay attention to how you hear. To those who listen to my teaching, more understanding will be given. But for those who are not listening, even what they think they understand will be taken away from them."
42Lk 8:19 Then Jesus' mother and brothers came to see him, but they couldn't get to him because of the crowd.
42Lk 8:20 Someone told Jesus, "Your mother and your brothers are outside, and they want to see you."
42Lk 8:21 Jesus replied, "My mother and my brothers are all those who hear God's word and obey it."
42Lk 8:22 One day Jesus said to his disciples, "Let's cross to the other side of the lake." So they got into a boat and started out.
42Lk 8:23 As they sailed across, Jesus settled down for a nap. But soon a fierce storm came down on the lake. The boat was filling with water, and they were in real danger.
42Lk 8:24 The disciples went and woke him up, shouting, "Master, Master, we're going to drown!" When Jesus woke up, he rebuked the wind and the raging waves. Suddenly the storm stopped and all was calm!
42Lk 8:25 Then he asked them, "Where is your faith?" The disciples were terrified and amazed. "Who is this man?" they asked each other. "When he gives a command, even the wind and waves obey him!"
42Lk 8:26 So they arrived in the region of the Gerasenes®Á, across the lake from Galilee. / ®ÁOther manuscripts read Gadarenes; still others read Gergesenes; also in 8.37. See Matt 8.28; Mark 5.1
42Lk 8:27 As Jesus was climbing out of the boat, a man who was possessed by demons came out to meet him. For a long time he had been homeless and naked, living in a cemetery outside the town.
42Lk 8:28 As soon as he saw Jesus, he shrieked and fell down in front of him. Then he screamed, "Why are you interfering with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? Please, I beg you, don't torture me!"
42Lk 8:29 For Jesus had already commanded the evil®Á spirit to come out of him. This spirit had often taken control of the man. Even when he was placed under guard and put in chains and shackles, he simply broke them and rushed out into the wilderness, completely under the demon's power. / ®ÁGreek unclean
42Lk 8:30 Jesus demanded, "What is your name?" "Legion," he replied, for he was filled with many demons.
42Lk 8:31 The demons kept begging Jesus not to send them into the bottomless pit®Á. / ®ÁOr the abyss, or the underworld
42Lk 8:32 There happened to be a large herd of pigs feeding on the hillside nearby, and the demons begged him to let them enter into the pigs. So Jesus gave them permission.
42Lk 8:33 Then the demons came out of the man and entered the pigs, and the entire herd plunged down the steep hillside into the lake and drowned.
42Lk 8:34 When the herdsmen saw it, they fled to the nearby town and the surrounding countryside, spreading the news as they ran.
42Lk 8:35 People rushed out to see what had happened. A crowd soon gathered around Jesus, and they saw the man who had been freed from the demons. He was sitting at Jesus' feet, fully clothed and perfectly sane, and they were all afraid.
42Lk 8:36 Then those who had seen what happened told the others how the demon-possessed man had been healed.
42Lk 8:37 And all the people in the region of the Gerasenes begged Jesus to go away and leave them alone, for a great wave of fear swept over them. So Jesus returned to the boat and left, crossing back to the other side of the lake.
42Lk 8:38 The man who had been freed from the demons begged to go with him. But Jesus sent him home, saying,
42Lk 8:39 "No, go back to your family, and tell them everything God has done for you." So he went all through the town proclaiming the great things Jesus had done for him.
42Lk 8:40 On the other side of the lake the crowds welcomed Jesus, because they had been waiting for him.
42Lk 8:41 Then a man named Jairus, a leader of the local synagogue, came and fell at Jesus' feet, pleading with him to come home with him.
42Lk 8:42 His only daughter®Á, who was about twelve years old, was dying. As Jesus went with him, he was surrounded by the crowds. / ®ÁOr His only child, a daughter
42Lk 8:43 A woman in the crowd had suffered for twelve years with constant bleeding®Á, and she could find no cure. / ®ÁSome manuscripts add having spent everything she had on doctors
42Lk 8:44 Coming up behind Jesus, she touched the fringe of his robe. Immediately, the bleeding stopped.
42Lk 8:45 "Who touched me?" Jesus asked. Everyone denied it, and Peter said, "Master, this whole crowd is pressing up against you."
42Lk 8:46 But Jesus said, "Someone deliberately touched me, for I felt healing power go out from me."
42Lk 8:47 When the woman realized that she could not stay hidden, she began to tremble and fell to her knees in front of him. The whole crowd heard her explain why she had touched him and that she had been immediately healed.
42Lk 8:48 "Daughter," he said to her, "your faith has made you well. Go in peace."
42Lk 8:49 While he was still speaking to her, a messenger arrived from the home of Jairus, the leader of the synagogue. He told him, "Your daughter is dead. There's no use troubling the Teacher now."
42Lk 8:50 But when Jesus heard what had happened, he said to Jairus, "Don't be afraid. Just have faith, and she will be healed."
42Lk 8:51 When they arrived at the house, Jesus wouldn't let anyone go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the little girl's father and mother.
42Lk 8:52 The house was filled with people weeping and wailing, but he said, "Stop the weeping! She isn't dead; she's only asleep."
42Lk 8:53 But the crowd laughed at him because they all knew she had died.
42Lk 8:54 Then Jesus took her by the hand and said in a loud voice, "My child, get up!"
42Lk 8:55 And at that moment her life®Á returned, and she immediately stood up! Then Jesus told them to give her something to eat. / ®ÁOr her spirit
42Lk 8:56 Her parents were overwhelmed, but Jesus insisted that they not tell anyone what had happened.
42Lk 9:1 One day Jesus called together his twelve disciples®Á and gave them power and authority to cast out all demons and to heal all diseases. / ®ÁGreek the Twelve; other manuscripts read the twelve apostles
42Lk 9:2 Then he sent them out to tell everyone about the Kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
42Lk 9:3 "Take nothing for your journey," he instructed them. "Don't take a walking stick, a traveler's bag, food, money®Á, or even a change of clothes. / ®ÁOr silver coins
42Lk 9:4 Wherever you go, stay in the same house until you leave town.
42Lk 9:5 And if a town refuses to welcome you, shake its dust from your feet as you leave to show that you have abandoned those people to their fate."
42Lk 9:6 So they began their circuit of the villages, preaching the Good News and healing the sick.
42Lk 9:7 When Herod Antipas, the ruler of Galilee®Á, heard about everything Jesus was doing, he was puzzled. Some were saying that John the Baptist had been raised from the dead. / ®ÁGreek Herod the tetrarch. Herod Antipas was a son of King Herod and was ruler over Galilee
42Lk 9:8 Others thought Jesus was Elijah or one of the other prophets risen from the dead.
42Lk 9:9 "I beheaded John," Herod said, "so who is this man about whom I hear such stories?" And he kept trying to see him.
42Lk 9:10 When the apostles returned, they told Jesus everything they had done. Then he slipped quietly away with them toward the town of Bethsaida.
42Lk 9:11 But the crowds found out where he was going, and they followed him. He welcomed them and taught them about the Kingdom of God, and he healed those who were sick.
42Lk 9:12 Late in the afternoon the twelve disciples came to him and said, "Send the crowds away to the nearby villages and farms, so they can find food and lodging for the night. There is nothing to eat here in this remote place."
42Lk 9:13 But Jesus said, "You feed them." "But we have only five loaves of bread and two fish," they answered. "Or are you expecting us to go and buy enough food for this whole crowd?"
42Lk 9:14 For there were about 5,000 men there. Jesus replied, "Tell them to sit down in groups of about fifty each."
42Lk 9:15 So the people all sat down.
42Lk 9:16 Jesus took the five loaves and two fish, looked up toward heaven, and blessed them. Then, breaking the loaves into pieces, he kept giving the bread and fish to the disciples so they could distribute it to the people.
42Lk 9:17 They all ate as much as they wanted, and afterward, the disciples picked up twelve baskets of leftovers!
42Lk 9:18 One day Jesus left the crowds to pray alone. Only his disciples were with him, and he asked them, "Who do people say I am?"
42Lk 9:19 "Well," they replied, "some say John the Baptist, some say Elijah, and others say you are one of the other ancient prophets risen from the dead."
42Lk 9:20 Then he asked them, "But who do you say I am?" Peter replied, "You are the Messiah®Á sent from God!" / ®ÁOr the Christ. Messiah (a Hebrew term) and Christ (a Greek term) both mean "the anointed one."
42Lk 9:21 Jesus warned his disciples not to tell anyone who he was.
42Lk 9:22 "The Son of Man®Á must suffer many terrible things," he said. "He will be rejected by the elders, the leading priests, and the teachers of religious law. He will be killed, but on the third day he will be raised from the dead." / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
42Lk 9:23 Then he said to the crowd, "If any of you wants to be my follower, you must turn from your selfish ways, take up your cross daily, and follow me.
42Lk 9:24 If you try to hang on to your life, you will lose it. But if you give up your life for my sake, you will save it.
42Lk 9:25 And what do you benefit if you gain the whole world but are yourself lost or destroyed?
42Lk 9:26 If anyone is ashamed of me and my message, the Son of Man will be ashamed of that person when he returns in his glory and in the glory of the Father and the holy angels.
42Lk 9:27 I tell you the truth, some standing here right now will not die before they see the Kingdom of God."
42Lk 9:28 About eight days later Jesus took Peter, John, and James up on a mountain to pray.
42Lk 9:29 And as he was praying, the appearance of his face was transformed, and his clothes became dazzling white.
42Lk 9:30 Suddenly, two men, Moses and Elijah, appeared and began talking with Jesus.
42Lk 9:31 They were glorious to see. And they were speaking about his exodus from this world, which was about to be fulfilled in Jerusalem.
42Lk 9:32 Peter and the others had fallen asleep. When they woke up, they saw Jesus' glory and the two men standing with him.
42Lk 9:33 As Moses and Elijah were starting to leave, Peter, not even knowing what he was saying, blurted out, "Master, it's wonderful for us to be here! Let's make three shelters as memorials®Á - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." / ®ÁGreek three tabernacles
42Lk 9:34 But even as he was saying this, a cloud overshadowed them, and terror gripped them as the cloud covered them.
42Lk 9:35 Then a voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, my Chosen One®Á. Listen to him." / ®ÁSome manuscripts read This is my dearly loved Son
42Lk 9:36 When the voice finished, Jesus was there alone. They didn't tell anyone at that time what they had seen.
42Lk 9:37 The next day, after they had come down the mountain, a large crowd met Jesus.
42Lk 9:38 A man in the crowd called out to him, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, my only child.
42Lk 9:39 An evil spirit keeps seizing him, making him scream. It throws him into convulsions so that he foams at the mouth. It batters him and hardly ever leaves him alone.
42Lk 9:40 I begged your disciples to cast out the spirit, but they couldn't do it."
42Lk 9:41 Jesus said, "You faithless and corrupt people! How long must I be with you and put up with you?" Then he said to the man, "Bring your son here."
42Lk 9:42 As the boy came forward, the demon knocked him to the ground and threw him into a violent convulsion. But Jesus rebuked the evil®Á spirit and healed the boy. Then he gave him back to his father. / ®ÁGreek unclean
42Lk 9:43 Awe gripped the people as they saw this majestic display of God's power. While everyone was marveling at everything he was doing, Jesus said to his disciples,
42Lk 9:44 "Listen to me and remember what I say. The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into the hands of his enemies."
42Lk 9:45 But they didn't know what he meant. Its significance was hidden from them, so they couldn't understand it, and they were afraid to ask him about it.
42Lk 9:46 Then his disciples began arguing about which of them was the greatest.
42Lk 9:47 But Jesus knew their thoughts, so he brought a little child to his side.
42Lk 9:48 Then he said to them, "Anyone who welcomes a little child like this on my behalf®Á welcomes me, and anyone who welcomes me also welcomes my Father who sent me. Whoever is the least among you is the greatest." / ®ÁGreek in my name
42Lk 9:49 John said to Jesus, "Master, we saw someone using your name to cast out demons, but we told him to stop because he isn't in our group."
42Lk 9:50 But Jesus said, "Don't stop him! Anyone who is not against you is for you."
42Lk 9:51 As the time drew near for him to ascend to heaven, Jesus resolutely set out for Jerusalem.
42Lk 9:52 He sent messengers ahead to a Samaritan village to prepare for his arrival.
42Lk 9:53 But the people of the village did not welcome Jesus because he was on his way to Jerusalem.
42Lk 9:54 When James and John saw this, they said to Jesus, "Lord, should we call down fire from heaven to burn them up®Á?" / ®ÁSome manuscripts add as Elijah did
42Lk 9:55 But Jesus turned and rebuked them®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts add an expanded conclusion to verse 55 and an additional sentence in verse 56£∫ And he said, "You don't realize what your hearts are like. 56 For the Son of Man has not come to destroy people's lives, but to save them."
42Lk 9:56 So they went on to another village.
42Lk 9:57 As they were walking along, someone said to Jesus, "I will follow you wherever you go."
42Lk 9:58 But Jesus replied, "Foxes have dens to live in, and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place even to lay his head."
42Lk 9:59 He said to another person, "Come, follow me." The man agreed, but he said, "Lord, first let me return home and bury my father."
42Lk 9:60 But Jesus told him, "Let the spiritually dead bury their own dead!®Á Your duty is to go and preach about the Kingdom of God." / ®ÁGreek Let the dead bury their own dead
42Lk 9:61 Another said, "Yes, Lord, I will follow you, but first let me say good-bye to my family."
42Lk 9:62 But Jesus told him, "Anyone who puts a hand to the plow and then looks back is not fit for the Kingdom of God."
42Lk 10:1 The Lord now chose seventy-two®Á other disciples and sent them ahead in pairs to all the towns and places he planned to visit. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read seventy; also in 10.17
42Lk 10:2 These were his instructions to them£∫ "The harvest is great, but the workers are few. So pray to the Lord who is in charge of the harvest; ask him to send more workers into his fields.
42Lk 10:3 Now go, and remember that I am sending you out as lambs among wolves.
42Lk 10:4 Don't take any money with you, nor a traveler's bag, nor an extra pair of sandals. And don't stop to greet anyone on the road.
42Lk 10:5 "Whenever you enter someone's home, first say, `May God's peace be on this house.'
42Lk 10:6 If those who live there are peaceful, the blessing will stand; if they are not, the blessing will return to you.
42Lk 10:7 Don't move around from home to home. Stay in one place, eating and drinking what they provide. Don't hesitate to accept hospitality, because those who work deserve their pay.
42Lk 10:8 "If you enter a town and it welcomes you, eat whatever is set before you.
42Lk 10:9 Heal the sick, and tell them, `The Kingdom of God is near you now.'
42Lk 10:10 But if a town refuses to welcome you, go out into its streets and say,
42Lk 10:11 `We wipe even the dust of your town from our feet to show that we have abandoned you to your fate. And know this?the Kingdom of God is near!'
42Lk 10:12 I assure you, even wicked Sodom will be better off than such a town on judgment day.
42Lk 10:13 "What sorrow awaits you, Korazin and Bethsaida! For if the miracles I did in you had been done in wicked Tyre and Sidon, their people would have repented of their sins long ago, clothing themselves in burlap and throwing ashes on their heads to show their remorse.
42Lk 10:14 Yes, Tyre and Sidon will be better off on judgment day than you.
42Lk 10:15 And you people of Capernaum, will you be honored in heaven? No, you will go down to the place of the dead®Á." / ®ÁGreek to Hades
42Lk 10:16 Then he said to the disciples, "Anyone who accepts your message is also accepting me. And anyone who rejects you is rejecting me. And anyone who rejects me is rejecting God, who sent me."
42Lk 10:17 When the seventy-two disciples returned, they joyfully reported to him, "Lord, even the demons obey us when we use your name!"
42Lk 10:18 "Yes," he told them, "I saw Satan fall from heaven like lightning!
42Lk 10:19 Look, I have given you authority over all the power of the enemy, and you can walk among snakes and scorpions and crush them. Nothing will injure you.
42Lk 10:20 But don't rejoice because evil spirits obey you; rejoice because your names are registered in heaven."
42Lk 10:21 At that same time Jesus was filled with the joy of the Holy Spirit, and he said, "O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, thank you for hiding these things from those who think themselves wise and clever, and for revealing them to the childlike. Yes, Father, it pleased you to do it this way.
42Lk 10:22 "My Father has entrusted everything to me. No one truly knows the Son except the Father, and no one truly knows the Father except the Son and those to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
42Lk 10:23 Then when they were alone, he turned to the disciples and said, "Blessed are the eyes that see what you have seen.
42Lk 10:24 I tell you, many prophets and kings longed to see what you see, but they didn't see it. And they longed to hear what you hear, but they didn't hear it."
42Lk 10:25 One day an expert in religious law stood up to test Jesus by asking him this question£∫ "Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?"
42Lk 10:26 Jesus replied, "What does the law of Moses say? How do you read it?"
42Lk 10:27 The man answered, "`You must love the LORD your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, and all your mind.' And, `Love your neighbor as yourself.'"®Á / ®ÁDeut 6.5; Lev 19.18
42Lk 10:28 "Right!" Jesus told him. "Do this and you will live!"
42Lk 10:29 The man wanted to justify his actions, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?"
42Lk 10:30 Jesus replied with a story£∫ "A Jewish man was traveling on a trip from Jerusalem to Jericho, and he was attacked by bandits. They stripped him of his clothes, beat him up, and left him half dead beside the road.
42Lk 10:31 "By chance a priest came along. But when he saw the man lying there, he crossed to the other side of the road and passed him by.
42Lk 10:32 A Temple assistant®Á walked over and looked at him lying there, but he also passed by on the other side. / ®ÁGreek A Levite
42Lk 10:33 "Then a despised Samaritan came along, and when he saw the man, he felt compassion for him.
42Lk 10:34 Going over to him, the Samaritan soothed his wounds with olive oil and wine and bandaged them. Then he put the man on his own donkey and took him to an inn, where he took care of him.
42Lk 10:35 The next day he handed the innkeeper two silver coins®Á, telling him, `Take care of this man. If his bill runs higher than this, I'll pay you the next time I'm here.' / ®ÁGreek two denarii. A denarius was equivalent to a laborer's full day's wage
42Lk 10:36 "Now which of these three would you say was a neighbor to the man who was attacked by bandits?" Jesus asked.
42Lk 10:37 The man replied, "The one who showed him mercy." Then Jesus said, "Yes, now go and do the same."
42Lk 10:38 As Jesus and the disciples continued on their way to Jerusalem, they came to a certain village where a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.
42Lk 10:39 Her sister, Mary, sat at the Lord's feet, listening to what he taught.
42Lk 10:40 But Martha was distracted by the big dinner she was preparing. She came to Jesus and said, "Lord, doesn't it seem unfair to you that my sister just sits here while I do all the work? Tell her to come and help me."
42Lk 10:41 But the Lord said to her, "My dear Martha, you are worried and upset over all these details!
42Lk 10:42 There is only one thing worth being concerned about. Mary has discovered it, and it will not be taken away from her."
42Lk 11:1 Once Jesus was in a certain place praying. As he finished, one of his disciples came to him and said, "Lord, teach us to pray, just as John taught his disciples."
42Lk 11:2 Jesus said, "This is how you should pray®Á. "Father, may your name be kept holy. May your Kingdom come soon. / ®ÁSome manuscripts add additional phrases from the Lord's Prayer as it reads in Matt 6.9-13
42Lk 11:3 Give us each day the food we need®Á, / ®ÁOr Give us each day our food for the day; or Give us each day our food for tomorrow
42Lk 11:4 and forgive us our sins, as we forgive those who sin against us. And don't let us yield to temptation®Á." / ®ÁOr And keep us from being tested
42Lk 11:5 Then, teaching them more about prayer, he used this story£∫ "Suppose you went to a friend's house at midnight, wanting to borrow three loaves of bread. You say to him,
42Lk 11:6 `A friend of mine has just arrived for a visit, and I have nothing for him to eat.'
42Lk 11:7 And suppose he calls out from his bedroom, `Don't bother me. The door is locked for the night, and my family and I are all in bed. I can't help you.'
42Lk 11:8 But I tell you this?though he won't do it for friendship's sake, if you keep knocking long enough, he will get up and give you whatever you need because of your shameless persistence®Á. / ®ÁOr in order to avoid shame, or so his reputation won't be damaged
42Lk 11:9 "And so I tell you, keep on asking, and you will receive what you ask for. Keep on seeking, and you will find. Keep on knocking, and the door will be opened to you.
42Lk 11:10 For everyone who asks, receives. Everyone who seeks, finds. And to everyone who knocks, the door will be opened.
42Lk 11:11 "You fathers?if your children ask®Á for a fish, do you give them a snake instead? / ®ÁSome manuscripts add for bread, do you give them a stone? Or [if they ask]
42Lk 11:12 Or if they ask for an egg, do you give them a scorpion? Of course not!
42Lk 11:13 So if you sinful people know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your heavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to those who ask him."
42Lk 11:14 One day Jesus cast out a demon from a man who couldn't speak, and when the demon was gone, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed,
42Lk 11:15 but some of them said, "No wonder he can cast out demons. He gets his power from Satan®Á, the prince of demons." / ®ÁGreek Beelzeboul; also in 11.18, 19. Other manuscripts read Beezeboul; Latin version reads Beelzebub
42Lk 11:16 Others, trying to test Jesus, demanded that he show them a miraculous sign from heaven to prove his authority.
42Lk 11:17 He knew their thoughts, so he said, "Any kingdom divided by civil war is doomed. A family splintered by feuding will fall apart.
42Lk 11:18 You say I am empowered by Satan. But if Satan is divided and fighting against himself, how can his kingdom survive?
42Lk 11:19 And if I am empowered by Satan, what about your own exorcists? They cast out demons, too, so they will condemn you for what you have said.
42Lk 11:20 But if I am casting out demons by the power of God®Á, then the Kingdom of God has arrived among you. / ®ÁGreek by the finger of God
42Lk 11:21 For when a strong man like Satan is fully armed and guards his palace, his possessions are safe?
42Lk 11:22 until someone even stronger attacks and overpowers him, strips him of his weapons, and carries off his belongings.
42Lk 11:23 "Anyone who isn't with me opposes me, and anyone who isn't working with me is actually working against me.
42Lk 11:24 "When an evil®Á spirit leaves a person, it goes into the desert, searching for rest. But when it finds none, it says, `I will return to the person I came from.' / ®ÁGreek unclean
42Lk 11:25 So it returns and finds that its former home is all swept and in order.
42Lk 11:26 Then the spirit finds seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all enter the person and live there. And so that person is worse off than before."
42Lk 11:27 As he was speaking, a woman in the crowd called out, "God bless your mother?the womb from which you came, and the breasts that nursed you!"
42Lk 11:28 Jesus replied, "But even more blessed are all who hear the word of God and put it into practice."
42Lk 11:29 As the crowd pressed in on Jesus, he said, "This evil generation keeps asking me to show them a miraculous sign. But the only sign I will give them is the sign of Jonah.
42Lk 11:30 What happened to him was a sign to the people of Nineveh that God had sent him. What happens to the Son of Man®Á will be a sign to these people that he was sent by God. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
42Lk 11:31 "The queen of Sheba®Á will stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it, for she came from a distant land to hear the wisdom of Solomon. Now someone greater than Solomon is here?but you refuse to listen. / ®ÁGreek The queen of the south
42Lk 11:32 The people of Nineveh will also stand up against this generation on judgment day and condemn it, for they repented of their sins at the preaching of Jonah. Now someone greater than Jonah is here?but you refuse to repent.
42Lk 11:33 "No one lights a lamp and then hides it or puts it under a basket®Á. Instead, a lamp is placed on a stand, where its light can be seen by all who enter the house. / ®ÁSome manuscripts omit or puts it under a basket
42Lk 11:34 "Your eye is a lamp that provides light for your body. When your eye is good, your whole body is filled with light. But when it is bad, your body is filled with darkness.
42Lk 11:35 Make sure that the light you think you have is not actually darkness.
42Lk 11:36 If you are filled with light, with no dark corners, then your whole life will be radiant, as though a floodlight were filling you with light."
42Lk 11:37 As Jesus was speaking, one of the Pharisees invited him home for a meal. So he went in and took his place at the table®Á. / ®ÁOr and reclined
42Lk 11:38 His host was amazed to see that he sat down to eat without first performing the hand-washing ceremony required by Jewish custom.
42Lk 11:39 Then the Lord said to him, "You Pharisees are so careful to clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but inside you are filthy?full of greed and wickedness!
42Lk 11:40 Fools! Didn't God make the inside as well as the outside?
42Lk 11:41 So clean the inside by giving gifts to the poor, and you will be clean all over.
42Lk 11:42 "What sorrow awaits you Pharisees! For you are careful to tithe even the tiniest income from your herb gardens®Á, but you ignore justice and the love of God. You should tithe, yes, but do not neglect the more important things. / ®ÁGreek tithe the mint, the rue, and every herb
42Lk 11:43 "What sorrow awaits you Pharisees! For you love to sit in the seats of honor in the synagogues and receive respectful greetings as you walk in the marketplaces.
42Lk 11:44 Yes, what sorrow awaits you! For you are like hidden graves in a field. People walk over them without knowing the corruption they are stepping on."
42Lk 11:45 "Teacher," said an expert in religious law, "you have insulted us, too, in what you just said."
42Lk 11:46 "Yes," said Jesus, "what sorrow also awaits you experts in religious law! For you crush people with unbearable religious demands, and you never lift a finger to ease the burden.
42Lk 11:47 What sorrow awaits you! For you build monuments for the prophets your own ancestors killed long ago.
42Lk 11:48 But in fact, you stand as witnesses who agree with what your ancestors did. They killed the prophets, and you join in their crime by building the monuments!
42Lk 11:49 This is what God in his wisdom said about you®Á. `I will send prophets and apostles to them, but they will kill some and persecute the others.' / ®ÁGreek Therefore, the wisdom of God said
42Lk 11:50 "As a result, this generation will be held responsible for the murder of all God's prophets from the creation of the world?
42Lk 11:51 from the murder of Abel to the murder of Zechariah, who was killed between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, it will certainly be charged against this generation.
42Lk 11:52 "What sorrow awaits you experts in religious law! For you remove the key to knowledge from the people. You don't enter the Kingdom yourselves, and you prevent others from entering."
42Lk 11:53 As Jesus was leaving, the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees became hostile and tried to provoke him with many questions.
42Lk 11:54 They wanted to trap him into saying something they could use against him.
42Lk 12:1 Meanwhile, the crowds grew until thousands were milling about and stepping on each other. Jesus turned first to his disciples and warned them, "Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees?their hypocrisy.
42Lk 12:2 The time is coming when everything that is covered up will be revealed, and all that is secret will be made known to all.
42Lk 12:3 Whatever you have said in the dark will be heard in the light, and what you have whispered behind closed doors will be shouted from the housetops for all to hear!
42Lk 12:4 "Dear friends, don't be afraid of those who want to kill your body; they cannot do any more to you after that.
42Lk 12:5 But I'll tell you whom to fear. Fear God, who has the power to kill you and then throw you into hell®Á. Yes, he's the one to fear. / ®ÁGreek Gehenna
42Lk 12:6 "What is the price of five sparrows?two copper coins®Á? Yet God does not forget a single one of them. / ®ÁGreek two assaria [Roman coins equal to - of a denarius]
42Lk 12:7 And the very hairs on your head are all numbered. So don't be afraid; you are more valuable to God than a whole flock of sparrows.
42Lk 12:8 "I tell you the truth, everyone who acknowledges me publicly here on earth, the Son of Man®Á will also acknowledge in the presence of God's angels. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
42Lk 12:9 But anyone who denies me here on earth will be denied before God's angels.
42Lk 12:10 Anyone who speaks against the Son of Man can be forgiven, but anyone who blasphemes the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
42Lk 12:11 "And when you are brought to trial in the synagogues and before rulers and authorities, don't worry about how to defend yourself or what to say,
42Lk 12:12 for the Holy Spirit will teach you at that time what needs to be said."
42Lk 12:13 Then someone called from the crowd, "Teacher, please tell my brother to divide our father's estate with me."
42Lk 12:14 Jesus replied, "Friend, who made me a judge over you to decide such things as that?"
42Lk 12:15 Then he said, "Beware! Guard against every kind of greed. Life is not measured by how much you own."
42Lk 12:16 Then he told them a story£∫ "A rich man had a fertile farm that produced fine crops.
42Lk 12:17 He said to himself, `What should I do? I don't have room for all my crops.'
42Lk 12:18 Then he said, `I know! I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones. Then I'll have room enough to store all my wheat and other goods.
42Lk 12:19 And I'll sit back and say to myself, "My friend, you have enough stored away for years to come. Now take it easy! Eat, drink, and be merry!"'
42Lk 12:20 "But God said to him, `You fool! You will die this very night. Then who will get everything you worked for?'
42Lk 12:21 "Yes, a person is a fool to store up earthly wealth but not have a rich relationship with God."
42Lk 12:22 Then, turning to his disciples, Jesus said, "That is why I tell you not to worry about everyday life?whether you have enough food to eat or enough clothes to wear.
42Lk 12:23 For life is more than food, and your body more than clothing.
42Lk 12:24 Look at the ravens. They don't plant or harvest or store food in barns, for God feeds them. And you are far more valuable to him than any birds!
42Lk 12:25 Can all your worries add a single moment to your life?
42Lk 12:26 And if worry can't accomplish a little thing like that, what's the use of worrying over bigger things?
42Lk 12:27 "Look at the lilies and how they grow. They don't work or make their clothing, yet Solomon in all his glory was not dressed as beautifully as they are.
42Lk 12:28 And if God cares so wonderfully for flowers that are here today and thrown into the fire tomorrow, he will certainly care for you. Why do you have so little faith?
42Lk 12:29 "And don't be concerned about what to eat and what to drink. Don't worry about such things.
42Lk 12:30 These things dominate the thoughts of unbelievers all over the world, but your Father already knows your needs.
42Lk 12:31 Seek the Kingdom of God above all else, and he will give you everything you need.
42Lk 12:32 "So don't be afraid, little flock. For it gives your Father great happiness to give you the Kingdom.
42Lk 12:33 "Sell your possessions and give to those in need. This will store up treasure for you in heaven! And the purses of heaven never get old or develop holes. Your treasure will be safe; no thief can steal it and no moth can destroy it.
42Lk 12:34 Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.
42Lk 12:35 "Be dressed for service and keep your lamps burning,
42Lk 12:36 as though you were waiting for your master to return from the wedding feast. Then you will be ready to open the door and let him in the moment he arrives and knocks.
42Lk 12:37 The servants who are ready and waiting for his return will be rewarded. I tell you the truth, he himself will seat them, put on an apron, and serve them as they sit and eat!
42Lk 12:38 He may come in the middle of the night or just before dawn®Á. But whenever he comes, he will reward the servants who are ready. / ®ÁGreek in the second or third watch
42Lk 12:39 "Understand this£∫ If a homeowner knew exactly when a burglar was coming, he would not permit his house to be broken into.
42Lk 12:40 You also must be ready all the time, for the Son of Man will come when least expected."
42Lk 12:41 Peter asked, "Lord, is that illustration just for us or for everyone?"
42Lk 12:42 And the Lord replied, "A faithful, sensible servant is one to whom the master can give the responsibility of managing his other household servants and feeding them.
42Lk 12:43 If the master returns and finds that the servant has done a good job, there will be a reward.
42Lk 12:44 I tell you the truth, the master will put that servant in charge of all he owns.
42Lk 12:45 But what if the servant thinks, `My master won't be back for a while,' and he begins beating the other servants, partying, and getting drunk?
42Lk 12:46 The master will return unannounced and unexpected, and he will cut the servant in pieces and banish him with the unfaithful.
42Lk 12:47 "And a servant who knows what the master wants, but isn't prepared and doesn't carry out those instructions, will be severely punished.
42Lk 12:48 But someone who does not know, and then does something wrong, will be punished only lightly. When someone has been given much, much will be required in return; and when someone has been entrusted with much, even more will be required.
42Lk 12:49 "I have come to set the world on fire, and I wish it were already burning!
42Lk 12:50 I have a terrible baptism of suffering ahead of me, and I am under a heavy burden until it is accomplished.
42Lk 12:51 Do you think I have come to bring peace to the earth? No, I have come to divide people against each other!
42Lk 12:52 From now on families will be split apart, three in favor of me, and two against?or two in favor and three against.
42Lk 12:53 `Father will be divided against son and son against father; mother against daughter and daughter against mother; and mother-in-law against daughter-in-law and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law.'®Á" / ®ÁMic 7.6
42Lk 12:54 Then Jesus turned to the crowd and said, "When you see clouds beginning to form in the west, you say, `Here comes a shower.' And you are right.
42Lk 12:55 When the south wind blows, you say, `Today will be a scorcher.' And it is.
42Lk 12:56 You fools! You know how to interpret the weather signs of the earth and sky, but you don't know how to interpret the present times.
42Lk 12:57 "Why can't you decide for yourselves what is right?
42Lk 12:58 When you are on the way to court with your accuser, try to settle the matter before you get there. Otherwise, your accuser may drag you before the judge, who will hand you over to an officer, who will throw you into prison.

42Lk 13:1 About this time Jesus was informed that Pilate had murdered some people from Galilee as they were offering sacrifices at the Temple.
42Lk 13:2 "Do you think those Galileans were worse sinners than all the other people from Galilee?" Jesus asked. "Is that why they suffered?
42Lk 13:3 Not at all! And you will perish, too, unless you repent of your sins and turn to God.
42Lk 13:4 And what about the eighteen people who died when the tower in Siloam fell on them? Were they the worst sinners in Jerusalem?
42Lk 13:5 No, and I tell you again that unless you repent, you will perish, too."
42Lk 13:6 Then Jesus told this story£∫ "A man planted a fig tree in his garden and came again and again to see if there was any fruit on it, but he was always disappointed.
42Lk 13:7 Finally, he said to his gardener, `I've waited three years, and there hasn't been a single fig! Cut it down. It's just taking up space in the garden.'
42Lk 13:8 "The gardener answered, `Sir, give it one more chance. Leave it another year, and I'll give it special attention and plenty of fertilizer.
42Lk 13:9 If we get figs next year, fine. If not, then you can cut it down.'"
42Lk 13:10 One Sabbath day as Jesus was teaching in a synagogue,
42Lk 13:11 he saw a woman who had been crippled by an evil spirit. She had been bent double for eighteen years and was unable to stand up straight.
42Lk 13:12 When Jesus saw her, he called her over and said, "Dear woman, you are healed of your sickness!"
42Lk 13:13 Then he touched her, and instantly she could stand straight. How she praised God!
42Lk 13:14 But the leader in charge of the synagogue was indignant that Jesus had healed her on the Sabbath day. "There are six days of the week for working," he said to the crowd. "Come on those days to be healed, not on the Sabbath."
42Lk 13:15 But the Lord replied, "You hypocrites! Each of you works on the Sabbath day! Don't you untie your ox or your donkey from its stall on the Sabbath and lead it out for water?
42Lk 13:16 This dear woman, a daughter of Abraham, has been held in bondage by Satan for eighteen years. Isn't it right that she be released, even on the Sabbath?"
42Lk 13:17 This shamed his enemies, but all the people rejoiced at the wonderful things he did.
42Lk 13:18 Then Jesus said, "What is the Kingdom of God like? How can I illustrate it?
42Lk 13:19 It is like a tiny mustard seed that a man planted in a garden; it grows and becomes a tree, and the birds make nests in its branches."
42Lk 13:20 He also asked, "What else is the Kingdom of God like?
42Lk 13:21 It is like the yeast a woman used in making bread. Even though she put only a little yeast in three measures of flour, it permeated every part of the dough."
42Lk 13:22 Jesus went through the towns and villages, teaching as he went, always pressing on toward Jerusalem.
42Lk 13:23 Someone asked him, "Lord, will only a few be saved?" He replied,
42Lk 13:24 "Work hard to enter the narrow door to God's Kingdom, for many will try to enter but will fail.
42Lk 13:25 When the master of the house has locked the door, it will be too late. You will stand outside knocking and pleading, `Lord, open the door for us!' But he will reply, `I don't know you or where you come from.'
42Lk 13:26 Then you will say, `But we ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'
42Lk 13:27 And he will reply, `I tell you, I don't know you or where you come from. Get away from me, all you who do evil.'
42Lk 13:28 "There will be weeping and gnashing of teeth, for you will see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the Kingdom of God, but you will be thrown out.
42Lk 13:29 And people will come from all over the world?from east and west, north and south?to take their places in the Kingdom of God.

42Lk 13:31 At that time some Pharisees said to him, "Get away from here if you want to live! Herod Antipas wants to kill you!"
42Lk 13:32 Jesus replied, "Go tell that fox that I will keep on casting out demons and healing people today and tomorrow; and the third day I will accomplish my purpose.
42Lk 13:33 Yes, today, tomorrow, and the next day I must proceed on my way. For it wouldn't do for a prophet of God to be killed except in Jerusalem!
42Lk 13:34 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones God's messengers! How often I have wanted to gather your children together as a hen protects her chicks beneath her wings, but you wouldn't let me.
42Lk 13:35 And now, look, your house is abandoned. And you will never see me again until you say, `Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the LORD!'®Á" / ®ÁPs 118.26
42Lk 14:1 One Sabbath day Jesus went to eat dinner in the home of a leader of the Pharisees, and the people were watching him closely.
42Lk 14:2 There was a man there whose arms and legs were swollen®Á. / ®ÁOr who had dropsy
42Lk 14:3 Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in religious law, "Is it permitted in the law to heal people on the Sabbath day, or not?"
42Lk 14:4 When they refused to answer, Jesus touched the sick man and healed him and sent him away.
42Lk 14:5 Then he turned to them and said, "Which of you doesn't work on the Sabbath? If your son®Á or your cow falls into a pit, don't you rush to get him out?" / ®ÁSome manuscripts read donkey
42Lk 14:6 Again they could not answer.
42Lk 14:7 When Jesus noticed that all who had come to the dinner were trying to sit in the seats of honor near the head of the table, he gave them this advice.
42Lk 14:8 "When you are invited to a wedding feast, don't sit in the seat of honor. What if someone who is more distinguished than you has also been invited?
42Lk 14:9 The host will come and say, `Give this person your seat.' Then you will be embarrassed, and you will have to take whatever seat is left at the foot of the table!
42Lk 14:10 "Instead, take the lowest place at the foot of the table. Then when your host sees you, he will come and say, `Friend, we have a better place for you!' Then you will be honored in front of all the other guests.
42Lk 14:11 For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."
42Lk 14:12 Then he turned to his host. "When you put on a luncheon or a banquet," he said, "don't invite your friends, brothers, relatives, and rich neighbors. For they will invite you back, and that will be your only reward.
42Lk 14:13 Instead, invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.
42Lk 14:14 Then at the resurrection of the righteous, God will reward you for inviting those who could not repay you."
42Lk 14:15 Hearing this, a man sitting at the table with Jesus exclaimed, "What a blessing it will be to attend a banquet®Á in the Kingdom of God!" / ®ÁGreek to eat bread
42Lk 14:16 Jesus replied with this story£∫ "A man prepared a great feast and sent out many invitations.
42Lk 14:17 When the banquet was ready, he sent his servant to tell the guests, `Come, the banquet is ready.'
42Lk 14:18 But they all began making excuses. One said, `I have just bought a field and must inspect it. Please excuse me.'
42Lk 14:19 Another said, `I have just bought five pairs of oxen, and I want to try them out. Please excuse me.'
42Lk 14:20 Another said, `I now have a wife, so I can't come.'
42Lk 14:21 "The servant returned and told his master what they had said. His master was furious and said, `Go quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and invite the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.'
42Lk 14:22 After the servant had done this, he reported, `There is still room for more.'
42Lk 14:23 So his master said, `Go out into the country lanes and behind the hedges and urge anyone you find to come, so that the house will be full.
42Lk 14:24 For none of those I first invited will get even the smallest taste of my banquet.'"
42Lk 14:25 A large crowd was following Jesus. He turned around and said to them,
42Lk 14:26 "If you want to be my disciple, you must hate everyone else by comparison?your father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters?yes, even your own life. Otherwise, you cannot be my disciple.
42Lk 14:27 And if you do not carry your own cross and follow me, you cannot be my disciple.
42Lk 14:28 "But don't begin until you count the cost. For who would begin construction of a building without first calculating the cost to see if there is enough money to finish it?
42Lk 14:29 Otherwise, you might complete only the foundation before running out of money, and then everyone would laugh at you.
42Lk 14:30 They would say, `There's the person who started that building and couldn't afford to finish it!'
42Lk 14:31 "Or what king would go to war against another king without first sitting down with his counselors to discuss whether his army of 10,000 could defeat the 20,000 soldiers marching against him?
42Lk 14:32 And if he can't, he will send a delegation to discuss terms of peace while the enemy is still far away.
42Lk 14:33 So you cannot become my disciple without giving up everything you own.
42Lk 14:34 "Salt is good for seasoning. But if it loses its flavor, how do you make it salty again?
42Lk 14:35 Flavorless salt is good neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. It is thrown away. Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand!"
42Lk 15:1 Tax collectors and other notorious sinners often came to listen to Jesus teach.
42Lk 15:2 This made the Pharisees and teachers of religious law complain that he was associating with such sinful people?even eating with them!
42Lk 15:3 So Jesus told them this story.
42Lk 15:4 "If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them gets lost, what will he do? Won't he leave the ninety-nine others in the wilderness and go to search for the one that is lost until he finds it?
42Lk 15:5 And when he has found it, he will joyfully carry it home on his shoulders.
42Lk 15:6 When he arrives, he will call together his friends and neighbors, saying, `Rejoice with me because I have found my lost sheep.'
42Lk 15:7 In the same way, there is more joy in heaven over one lost sinner who repents and returns to God than over ninety-nine others who are righteous and haven't strayed away!
42Lk 15:8 "Or suppose a woman has ten silver coins®Á and loses one. Won't she light a lamp and sweep the entire house and search carefully until she finds it? / ®ÁGreek ten drachmas. A drachma was the equivalent of a full day's wage
42Lk 15:9 And when she finds it, she will call in her friends and neighbors and say, `Rejoice with me because I have found my lost coin.'
42Lk 15:10 In the same way, there is joy in the presence of God's angels when even one sinner repents."
42Lk 15:11 To illustrate the point further, Jesus told them this story£∫ "A man had two sons.
42Lk 15:12 The younger son told his father, `I want my share of your estate now before you die.' So his father agreed to divide his wealth between his sons.
42Lk 15:13 "A few days later this younger son packed all his belongings and moved to a distant land, and there he wasted all his money in wild living.
42Lk 15:14 About the time his money ran out, a great famine swept over the land, and he began to starve.
42Lk 15:15 He persuaded a local farmer to hire him, and the man sent him into his fields to feed the pigs.
42Lk 15:16 The young man became so hungry that even the pods he was feeding the pigs looked good to him. But no one gave him anything.
42Lk 15:17 "When he finally came to his senses, he said to himself, `At home even the hired servants have food enough to spare, and here I am dying of hunger!
42Lk 15:18 I will go home to my father and say, "Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you,
42Lk 15:19 and I am no longer worthy of being called your son. Please take me on as a hired servant."'
42Lk 15:20 "So he returned home to his father. And while he was still a long way off, his father saw him coming. Filled with love and compassion, he ran to his son, embraced him, and kissed him.
42Lk 15:21 His son said to him, `Father, I have sinned against both heaven and you, and I am no longer worthy of being called your son®Á.' / ®ÁSome manuscripts add Please take me on as a hired servant
42Lk 15:22 "But his father said to the servants, `Quick! Bring the finest robe in the house and put it on him. Get a ring for his finger and sandals for his feet.
42Lk 15:23 And kill the calf we have been fattening. We must celebrate with a feast,
42Lk 15:24 for this son of mine was dead and has now returned to life. He was lost, but now he is found.' So the party began.
42Lk 15:25 "Meanwhile, the older son was in the fields working. When he returned home, he heard music and dancing in the house,
42Lk 15:26 and he asked one of the servants what was going on.
42Lk 15:27 `Your brother is back,' he was told, `and your father has killed the fattened calf. We are celebrating because of his safe return.'
42Lk 15:28 "The older brother was angry and wouldn't go in. His father came out and begged him,
42Lk 15:29 but he replied, `All these years I've slaved for you and never once refused to do a single thing you told me to. And in all that time you never gave me even one young goat for a feast with my friends.
42Lk 15:30 Yet when this son of yours comes back after squandering your money on prostitutes, you celebrate by killing the fattened calf!'
42Lk 15:31 "His father said to him, `Look, dear son, you have always stayed by me, and everything I have is yours.
42Lk 15:32 We had to celebrate this happy day. For your brother was dead and has come back to life! He was lost, but now he is found!'"
42Lk 16:1 Jesus told this story to his disciples£∫ "There was a certain rich man who had a manager handling his affairs. One day a report came that the manager was wasting his employer's money.
42Lk 16:2 So the employer called him in and said, `What's this I hear about you? Get your report in order, because you are going to be fired.'
42Lk 16:3 "The manager thought to himself, `Now what? My boss has fired me. I don't have the strength to dig ditches, and I'm too proud to beg.
42Lk 16:4 Ah, I know how to ensure that I'll have plenty of friends who will give me a home when I am fired.'
42Lk 16:5 "So he invited each person who owed money to his employer to come and discuss the situation. He asked the first one, `How much do you owe him?'
42Lk 16:6 The man replied, `I owe him 800 gallons of olive oil.' So the manager told him, `Take the bill and quickly change it to 400 gallons®Á.' / ®ÁGreek 100 baths . . . 50 [baths]
42Lk 16:7 "`And how much do you owe my employer?' he asked the next man. `I owe him 1,000 bushels of wheat,' was the reply. `Here,' the manager said, `take the bill and change it to 800 bushels®Á.' / ®ÁGreek 100 korous . . . 80 [korous]
42Lk 16:8 "The rich man had to admire the dishonest rascal for being so shrewd. And it is true that the children of this world are more shrewd in dealing with the world around them than are the children of the light.
42Lk 16:9 Here's the lesson£∫ Use your worldly resources to benefit others and make friends. Then, when your earthly possessions are gone, they will welcome you to an eternal home®Á. / ®ÁOr you will be welcomed into eternal homes
42Lk 16:10 "If you are faithful in little things, you will be faithful in large ones. But if you are dishonest in little things, you won't be honest with greater responsibilities.
42Lk 16:11 And if you are untrustworthy about worldly wealth, who will trust you with the true riches of heaven?
42Lk 16:12 And if you are not faithful with other people's things, why should you be trusted with things of your own?
42Lk 16:13 "No one can serve two masters. For you will hate one and love the other; you will be devoted to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and money."
42Lk 16:14 The Pharisees, who dearly loved their money, heard all this and scoffed at him.
42Lk 16:15 Then he said to them, "You like to appear righteous in public, but God knows your hearts. What this world honors is detestable in the sight of God.
42Lk 16:16 "Until John the Baptist, the law of Moses and the messages of the prophets were your guides. But now the Good News of the Kingdom of God is preached, and everyone is eager to get in®Á. / ®ÁOr everyone is urged to enter in
42Lk 16:17 But that doesn't mean that the law has lost its force. It is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for the smallest point of God's law to be overturned.
42Lk 16:18 "For example, a man who divorces his wife and marries someone else commits adultery. And anyone who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery."
42Lk 16:19 Jesus said, "There was a certain rich man who was splendidly clothed in purple and fine linen and who lived each day in luxury.
42Lk 16:20 At his gate lay a poor man named Lazarus who was covered with sores.
42Lk 16:21 As Lazarus lay there longing for scraps from the rich man's table, the dogs would come and lick his open sores.
42Lk 16:22 "Finally, the poor man died and was carried by the angels to be with Abraham®Á. The rich man also died and was buried, / ®ÁGreek into Abraham's bosom
42Lk 16:23 and his soul went to the place of the dead®Á. There, in torment, he saw Abraham in the far distance with Lazarus at his side. / ®ÁGreek to Hades
42Lk 16:24 "The rich man shouted, `Father Abraham, have some pity! Send Lazarus over here to dip the tip of his finger in water and cool my tongue. I am in anguish in these flames.'
42Lk 16:25 "But Abraham said to him, `Son, remember that during your lifetime you had everything you wanted, and Lazarus had nothing. So now he is here being comforted, and you are in anguish.
42Lk 16:26 And besides, there is a great chasm separating us. No one can cross over to you from here, and no one can cross over to us from there.'
42Lk 16:27 "Then the rich man said, `Please, Father Abraham, at least send him to my father's home.
42Lk 16:28 For I have five brothers, and I want him to warn them so they don't end up in this place of torment.'
42Lk 16:29 "But Abraham said, `Moses and the prophets have warned them. Your brothers can read what they wrote.'
42Lk 16:30 "The rich man replied, `No, Father Abraham! But if someone is sent to them from the dead, then they will repent of their sins and turn to God.'
42Lk 16:31 "But Abraham said, `If they won't listen to Moses and the prophets, they won't listen even if someone rises from the dead.'"
42Lk 17:1 One day Jesus said to his disciples, "There will always be temptations to sin, but what sorrow awaits the person who does the tempting!
42Lk 17:2 It would be better to be thrown into the sea with a millstone hung around your neck than to cause one of these little ones to fall into sin.
42Lk 17:3 So watch yourselves! "If another believer®Á sins, rebuke that person; then if there is repentance, forgive. / ®ÁGreek If your brother
42Lk 17:4 Even if that person wrongs you seven times a day and each time turns again and asks forgiveness, you must forgive."
42Lk 17:5 The apostles said to the Lord, "Show us how to increase our faith."
42Lk 17:6 The Lord answered, "If you had faith even as small as a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, `May you be uprooted and thrown into the sea,' and it would obey you!
42Lk 17:7 "When a servant comes in from plowing or taking care of sheep, does his master say, `Come in and eat with me'?
42Lk 17:8 No, he says, `Prepare my meal, put on your apron, and serve me while I eat. Then you can eat later.'
42Lk 17:9 And does the master thank the servant for doing what he was told to do? Of course not.
42Lk 17:10 In the same way, when you obey me you should say, `We are unworthy servants who have simply done our duty.'"
42Lk 17:11 As Jesus continued on toward Jerusalem, he reached the border between Galilee and Samaria.
42Lk 17:12 As he entered a village there, ten lepers stood at a distance,
42Lk 17:13 crying out, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
42Lk 17:14 He looked at them and said, "Go show yourselves to the priests."®Á And as they went, they were cleansed of their leprosy. / ®ÁSee Lev 14.2-32
42Lk 17:15 One of them, when he saw that he was healed, came back to Jesus, shouting, "Praise God!"
42Lk 17:16 He fell to the ground at Jesus' feet, thanking him for what he had done. This man was a Samaritan.
42Lk 17:17 Jesus asked, "Didn't I heal ten men? Where are the other nine?
42Lk 17:18 Has no one returned to give glory to God except this foreigner?"
42Lk 17:19 And Jesus said to the man, "Stand up and go. Your faith has healed you®Á." / ®ÁOr Your faith has saved you
42Lk 17:20 One day the Pharisees asked Jesus, "When will the Kingdom of God come?" Jesus replied, "The Kingdom of God can't be detected by visible signs®Á. / ®ÁOr by your speculations

42Lk 17:22 Then he said to his disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see the day when the Son of Man returns®Á, but you won't see it. / ®ÁOr long for even one day with the Son of Man. "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
42Lk 17:23 People will tell you, `Look, there is the Son of Man,' or `Here he is,' but don't go out and follow them.
42Lk 17:24 For as the lightning flashes and lights up the sky from one end to the other, so it will be on the day when the Son of Man comes.
42Lk 17:25 But first the Son of Man must suffer terribly®Á and be rejected by this generation. / ®ÁOr suffer many things
42Lk 17:26 "When the Son of Man returns, it will be like it was in Noah's day.
42Lk 17:27 In those days, the people enjoyed banquets and parties and weddings right up to the time Noah entered his boat and the flood came and destroyed them all.
42Lk 17:28 "And the world will be as it was in the days of Lot. People went about their daily business?eating and drinking, buying and selling, farming and building?
42Lk 17:29 until the morning Lot left Sodom. Then fire and burning sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed them all.
42Lk 17:30 Yes, it will be `business as usual' right up to the day when the Son of Man is revealed.
42Lk 17:31 On that day a person out on the deck of a roof must not go down into the house to pack. A person out in the field must not return home.
42Lk 17:32 Remember what happened to Lot's wife!
42Lk 17:33 If you cling to your life, you will lose it, and if you let your life go, you will save it.
42Lk 17:34 That night two people will be asleep in one bed; one will be taken, the other left.
42Lk 17:35 Two women will be grinding flour together at the mill; one will be taken, the other left."
42Lk 17:36 ®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts add verse 36, Two men will be working in the field; one will be taken, the other left. Compare Matt 24.40
42Lk 17:37 "Where will this happen, Lord?"®Á the disciples asked. Jesus replied, "Just as the gathering of vultures shows there is a carcass nearby, so these signs indicate that the end is near."®Ë / ®ÁGreek "Where, Lord?" ®ËGreek "Wherever the carcass is, the vultures gather."
42Lk 18:1 One day Jesus told his disciples a story to show that they should always pray and never give up.
42Lk 18:2 "There was a judge in a certain city," he said, "who neither feared God nor cared about people.
42Lk 18:3 A widow of that city came to him repeatedly, saying, `Give me justice in this dispute with my enemy.'
42Lk 18:4 The judge ignored her for a while, but finally he said to himself, `I don't fear God or care about people,
42Lk 18:5 but this woman is driving me crazy. I'm going to see that she gets justice, because she is wearing me out with her constant requests!'"
42Lk 18:6 Then the Lord said, "Learn a lesson from this unjust judge.
42Lk 18:7 Even he rendered a just decision in the end. So don't you think God will surely give justice to his chosen people who cry out to him day and night? Will he keep putting them off?
42Lk 18:8 I tell you, he will grant justice to them quickly! But when the Son of Man®Á returns, how many will he find on the earth who have faith?" / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
42Lk 18:9 Then Jesus told this story to some who had great confidence in their own righteousness and scorned everyone else.
42Lk 18:10 "Two men went to the Temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a despised tax collector.
42Lk 18:11 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed this prayer®Á£∫ `I thank you, God, that I am not a sinner like everyone else. For I don't cheat, I don't sin, and I don't commit adultery. I'm certainly not like that tax collector! / ®ÁSome manuscripts read stood and prayed this prayer to himself
42Lk 18:12 I fast twice a week, and I give you a tenth of my income.'
42Lk 18:13 "But the tax collector stood at a distance and dared not even lift his eyes to heaven as he prayed. Instead, he beat his chest in sorrow, saying, `O God, be merciful to me, for I am a sinner.'
42Lk 18:14 I tell you, this sinner, not the Pharisee, returned home justified before God. For those who exalt themselves will be humbled, and those who humble themselves will be exalted."
42Lk 18:15 One day some parents brought their little children to Jesus so he could touch and bless them. But when the disciples saw this, they scolded the parents for bothering him.
42Lk 18:16 Then Jesus called for the children and said to the disciples, "Let the children come to me. Don't stop them! For the Kingdom of God belongs to those who are like these children.
42Lk 18:17 I tell you the truth, anyone who doesn't receive the Kingdom of God like a child will never enter it."
42Lk 18:18 Once a religious leader asked Jesus this question£∫ "Good Teacher, what should I do to inherit eternal life?"
42Lk 18:19 "Why do you call me good?" Jesus asked him. "Only God is truly good.
42Lk 18:20 But to answer your question, you know the commandments£∫ `You must not commit adultery. You must not murder. You must not steal. You must not testify falsely. Honor your father and mother.'®Á" / ®ÁExod 20.12-16; Deut 5.16-20
42Lk 18:21 The man replied, "I've obeyed all these commandments since I was young."
42Lk 18:22 When Jesus heard his answer, he said, "There is still one thing you haven't done. Sell all your possessions and give the money to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come, follow me."
42Lk 18:23 But when the man heard this he became very sad, for he was very rich.
42Lk 18:24 When Jesus saw this®Á, he said, "How hard it is for the rich to enter the Kingdom of God! / ®ÁSome manuscripts read When Jesus saw how sad the man was
42Lk 18:25 In fact, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the Kingdom of God!"
42Lk 18:26 Those who heard this said, "Then who in the world can be saved?"
42Lk 18:27 He replied, "What is impossible for people is possible with God."
42Lk 18:28 Peter said, "We've left our homes to follow you."
42Lk 18:29 "Yes," Jesus replied, "and I assure you that everyone who has given up house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the Kingdom of God,
42Lk 18:30 will be repaid many times over in this life, and will have eternal life in the world to come."
42Lk 18:31 Taking the twelve disciples aside, Jesus said, "Listen, we're going up to Jerusalem, where all the predictions of the prophets concerning the Son of Man will come true.
42Lk 18:32 He will be handed over to the Romans®Á, and he will be mocked, treated shamefully, and spit upon. / ®ÁGreek the Gentiles
42Lk 18:33 They will flog him with a whip and kill him, but on the third day he will rise again."
42Lk 18:34 But they didn't understand any of this. The significance of his words was hidden from them, and they failed to grasp what he was talking about.
42Lk 18:35 As Jesus approached Jericho, a blind beggar was sitting beside the road.
42Lk 18:36 When he heard the noise of a crowd going past, he asked what was happening.
42Lk 18:37 They told him that Jesus the Nazarene®Á was going by. / ®ÁOr Jesus of Nazareth
42Lk 18:38 So he began shouting, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42Lk 18:39 "Be quiet!" the people in front yelled at him. But he only shouted louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42Lk 18:40 When Jesus heard him, he stopped and ordered that the man be brought to him. As the man came near, Jesus asked him,
42Lk 18:41 "What do you want me to do for you?" "Lord," he said, "I want to see!"
42Lk 18:42 And Jesus said, "All right, receive your sight! Your faith has healed you."
42Lk 18:43 Instantly the man could see, and he followed Jesus, praising God. And all who saw it praised God, too.
42Lk 19:1 Jesus entered Jericho and made his way through the town.
42Lk 19:2 There was a man there named Zacchaeus. He was the chief tax collector in the region, and he had become very rich.
42Lk 19:3 He tried to get a look at Jesus, but he was too short to see over the crowd.
42Lk 19:4 So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree beside the road, for Jesus was going to pass that way.
42Lk 19:5 When Jesus came by, he looked up at Zacchaeus and called him by name. "Zacchaeus!" he said. "Quick, come down! I must be a guest in your home today."
42Lk 19:6 Zacchaeus quickly climbed down and took Jesus to his house in great excitement and joy.
42Lk 19:7 But the people were displeased. "He has gone to be the guest of a notorious sinner," they grumbled.
42Lk 19:8 Meanwhile, Zacchaeus stood before the Lord and said, "I will give half my wealth to the poor, Lord, and if I have cheated people on their taxes, I will give them back four times as much!"
42Lk 19:9 Jesus responded, "Salvation has come to this home today, for this man has shown himself to be a true son of Abraham.
42Lk 19:10 For the Son of Man®Á came to seek and save those who are lost." / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
42Lk 19:11 The crowd was listening to everything Jesus said. And because he was nearing Jerusalem, he told them a story to correct the impression that the Kingdom of God would begin right away.
42Lk 19:12 He said, "A nobleman was called away to a distant empire to be crowned king and then return.
42Lk 19:13 Before he left, he called together ten of his servants and divided among them ten pounds of silver®Á, saying, `Invest this for me while I am gone.' / ®ÁGreek ten minas; one mina was worth about three months' wages
42Lk 19:14 But his people hated him and sent a delegation after him to say, `We do not want him to be our king.'
42Lk 19:15 "After he was crowned king, he returned and called in the servants to whom he had given the money. He wanted to find out what their profits were.
42Lk 19:16 The first servant reported, `Master, I invested your money and made ten times the original amount!'
42Lk 19:17 "`Well done!' the king exclaimed. `You are a good servant. You have been faithful with the little I entrusted to you, so you will be governor of ten cities as your reward.'
42Lk 19:18 "The next servant reported, `Master, I invested your money and made five times the original amount.'
42Lk 19:19 "`Well done!' the king said. `You will be governor over five cities.'
42Lk 19:20 "But the third servant brought back only the original amount of money and said, `Master, I hid your money and kept it safe.
42Lk 19:21 I was afraid because you are a hard man to deal with, taking what isn't yours and harvesting crops you didn't plant.'
42Lk 19:22 "`You wicked servant!' the king roared. `Your own words condemn you. If you knew that I'm a hard man who takes what isn't mine and harvests crops I didn't plant,
42Lk 19:23 why didn't you deposit my money in the bank? At least I could have gotten some interest on it.'
42Lk 19:24 "Then, turning to the others standing nearby, the king ordered, `Take the money from this servant, and give it to the one who has ten pounds.'
42Lk 19:25 "`But, master,' they said, `he already has ten pounds!'
42Lk 19:26 "`Yes,' the king replied, `and to those who use well what they are given, even more will be given. But from those who do nothing, even what little they have will be taken away.
42Lk 19:27 And as for these enemies of mine who didn't want me to be their king?bring them in and execute them right here in front of me.'"
42Lk 19:28 After telling this story, Jesus went on toward Jerusalem, walking ahead of his disciples.
42Lk 19:29 As he came to the towns of Bethphage and Bethany on the Mount of Olives, he sent two disciples ahead.
42Lk 19:30 "Go into that village over there," he told them. "As you enter it, you will see a young donkey tied there that no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here.
42Lk 19:31 If anyone asks, `Why are you untying that colt?' just say, `The Lord needs it.'"
42Lk 19:32 So they went and found the colt, just as Jesus had said.
42Lk 19:33 And sure enough, as they were untying it, the owners asked them, "Why are you untying that colt?"
42Lk 19:34 And the disciples simply replied, "The Lord needs it."
42Lk 19:35 So they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their garments over it for him to ride on.
42Lk 19:36 As he rode along, the crowds spread out their garments on the road ahead of him.
42Lk 19:37 When he reached the place where the road started down the Mount of Olives, all of his followers began to shout and sing as they walked along, praising God for all the wonderful miracles they had seen.
42Lk 19:38 "Blessings on the King who comes in the name of the LORD! Peace in heaven, and glory in highest heaven!"®Á / ®ÁPss 118.26; 148.1
42Lk 19:39 But some of the Pharisees among the crowd said, "Teacher, rebuke your followers for saying things like that!"
42Lk 19:40 He replied, "If they kept quiet, the stones along the road would burst into cheers!"
42Lk 19:41 But as he came closer to Jerusalem and saw the city ahead, he began to weep.
42Lk 19:42 "How I wish today that you of all people would understand the way to peace. But now it is too late, and peace is hidden from your eyes.
42Lk 19:43 Before long your enemies will build ramparts against your walls and encircle you and close in on you from every side.
42Lk 19:44 They will crush you into the ground, and your children with you. Your enemies will not leave a single stone in place, because you did not accept your opportunity for salvation."
42Lk 19:45 Then Jesus entered the Temple and began to drive out the people selling animals for sacrifices.
42Lk 19:46 He said to them, "The Scriptures declare, `My Temple will be a house of prayer,' but you have turned it into a den of thieves."®Á / ®ÁIsa 56.7; Jer 7.11
42Lk 19:47 After that, he taught daily in the Temple, but the leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the other leaders of the people began planning how to kill him.
42Lk 19:48 But they could think of nothing, because all the people hung on every word he said.
42Lk 20:1 One day as Jesus was teaching the people and preaching the Good News in the Temple, the leading priests, the teachers of religious law, and the elders came up to him.
42Lk 20:2 They demanded, "By what authority are you doing all these things? Who gave you the right?"
42Lk 20:3 "Let me ask you a question first," he replied.
42Lk 20:4 "Did John's authority to baptize come from heaven, or was it merely human?"
42Lk 20:5 They talked it over among themselves. "If we say it was from heaven, he will ask why we didn't believe John.
42Lk 20:6 But if we say it was merely human, the people will stone us because they are convinced John was a prophet."
42Lk 20:7 So they finally replied that they didn't know.
42Lk 20:8 And Jesus responded, "Then I won't tell you by what authority I do these things."
42Lk 20:9 Now Jesus turned to the people again and told them this story£∫ "A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and moved to another country to live for several years.
42Lk 20:10 At the time of the grape harvest, he sent one of his servants to collect his share of the crop. But the farmers attacked the servant, beat him up, and sent him back empty-handed.
42Lk 20:11 So the owner sent another servant, but they also insulted him, beat him up, and sent him away empty-handed.
42Lk 20:12 A third man was sent, and they wounded him and chased him away.
42Lk 20:13 "`What will I do?' the owner asked himself. `I know! I'll send my cherished son. Surely they will respect him.'
42Lk 20:14 "But when the tenant farmers saw his son, they said to each other, `Here comes the heir to this estate. Let's kill him and get the estate for ourselves!'
42Lk 20:15 So they dragged him out of the vineyard and murdered him. "What do you suppose the owner of the vineyard will do to them?" Jesus asked.
42Lk 20:16 "I'll tell you?he will come and kill those farmers and lease the vineyard to others." "How terrible that such a thing should ever happen," his listeners protested.
42Lk 20:17 Jesus looked at them and said, "Then what does this Scripture mean? `The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone.'®Á / ®ÁPs 118.22
42Lk 20:18 Everyone who stumbles over that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone it falls on."
42Lk 20:19 The teachers of religious law and the leading priests wanted to arrest Jesus immediately because they realized he was telling the story against them?they were the wicked farmers. But they were afraid of the people's reaction.
42Lk 20:20 Watching for their opportunity, the leaders sent spies pretending to be honest men. They tried to get Jesus to say something that could be reported to the Roman governor so he would arrest Jesus.
42Lk 20:21 "Teacher," they said, "we know that you speak and teach what is right and are not influenced by what others think. You teach the way of God truthfully.
42Lk 20:22 Now tell us?is it right for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
42Lk 20:23 He saw through their trickery and said,
42Lk 20:24 "Show me a Roman coin®Á. Whose picture and title are stamped on it?" "Caesar's," they replied. / ®ÁGreek a denarius
42Lk 20:25 "Well then," he said, "give to Caesar what belongs to Caesar, and give to God what belongs to God."
42Lk 20:26 So they failed to trap him by what he said in front of the people. Instead, they were amazed by his answer, and they became silent.
42Lk 20:27 Then Jesus was approached by some Sadducees?religious leaders who say there is no resurrection from the dead.
42Lk 20:28 They posed this question£∫ "Teacher, Moses gave us a law that if a man dies, leaving a wife but no children, his brother should marry the widow and have a child who will carry on the brother's name®Á. / ®ÁSee Deut 25.5-6
42Lk 20:29 Well, suppose there were seven brothers. The oldest one married and then died without children.
42Lk 20:30 So the second brother married the widow, but he also died.
42Lk 20:31 Then the third brother married her. This continued with all seven of them, who died without children.
42Lk 20:32 Finally, the woman also died.
42Lk 20:33 So tell us, whose wife will she be in the resurrection? For all seven were married to her!"
42Lk 20:34 Jesus replied, "Marriage is for people here on earth.
42Lk 20:35 But in the age to come, those worthy of being raised from the dead will neither marry nor be given in marriage.
42Lk 20:36 And they will never die again. In this respect they will be like angels. They are children of God and children of the resurrection.
42Lk 20:37 "But now, as to whether the dead will be raised?even Moses proved this when he wrote about the burning bush. Long after Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob had died, he referred to the Lord®Á as `the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'®Ë / ®ÁGreek when he wrote about the bush. He referred to the Lord ®ËExod 3.6
42Lk 20:38 So he is the God of the living, not the dead, for they are all alive to him."
42Lk 20:39 "Well said, Teacher!" remarked some of the teachers of religious law who were standing there.
42Lk 20:40 And then no one dared to ask him any more questions.
42Lk 20:41 Then Jesus presented them with a question. "Why is it," he asked, "that the Messiah is said to be the son of David?
42Lk 20:42 For David himself wrote in the book of Psalms£∫ `The LORD said to my Lord, Sit in the place of honor at my right hand
42Lk 20:43 until I humble your enemies, making them a footstool under your feet.'®Á / ®ÁPs 110.1
42Lk 20:44 Since David called the Messiah `Lord,' how can the Messiah be his son?"
42Lk 20:45 Then, with the crowds listening, he turned to his disciples and said,
42Lk 20:46 "Beware of these teachers of religious law! For they like to parade around in flowing robes and love to receive respectful greetings as they walk in the marketplaces. And how they love the seats of honor in the synagogues and the head table at banquets.
42Lk 20:47 Yet they shamelessly cheat widows out of their property and then pretend to be pious by making long prayers in public. Because of this, they will be severely punished."
42Lk 21:1 While Jesus was in the Temple, he watched the rich people dropping their gifts in the collection box.
42Lk 21:2 Then a poor widow came by and dropped in two small coins®Á. / ®ÁGreek two lepta [the smallest of Jewish coins]
42Lk 21:3 "I tell you the truth," Jesus said, "this poor widow has given more than all the rest of them.
42Lk 21:4 For they have given a tiny part of their surplus, but she, poor as she is, has given everything she has."
42Lk 21:5 Some of his disciples began talking about the majestic stonework of the Temple and the memorial decorations on the walls. But Jesus said,
42Lk 21:6 "The time is coming when all these things will be completely demolished. Not one stone will be left on top of another!"
42Lk 21:7 "Teacher," they asked, "when will all this happen? What sign will show us that these things are about to take place?"
42Lk 21:8 He replied, "Don't let anyone mislead you, for many will come in my name, claiming, `I am the Messiah,'®Á and saying, `The time has come!' But don't believe them. / ®ÁGreek claiming, `I am.'
42Lk 21:9 And when you hear of wars and insurrections, don't panic. Yes, these things must take place first, but the end won't follow immediately."
42Lk 21:10 Then he added, "Nation will go to war against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
42Lk 21:11 There will be great earthquakes, and there will be famines and plagues in many lands, and there will be terrifying things and great miraculous signs from heaven.
42Lk 21:12 "But before all this occurs, there will be a time of great persecution. You will be dragged into synagogues and prisons, and you will stand trial before kings and governors because you are my followers.
42Lk 21:13 But this will be your opportunity to tell them about me®Á. / ®ÁOr This will be your testimony against them
42Lk 21:14 So don't worry in advance about how to answer the charges against you,
42Lk 21:15 for I will give you the right words and such wisdom that none of your opponents will be able to reply or refute you!
42Lk 21:16 Even those closest to you?your parents, brothers, relatives, and friends?will betray you. They will even kill some of you.
42Lk 21:17 And everyone will hate you because you are my followers®Á. / ®ÁGreek on account of my name
42Lk 21:18 But not a hair of your head will perish!
42Lk 21:19 By standing firm, you will win your souls.
42Lk 21:20 "And when you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then you will know that the time of its destruction has arrived.
42Lk 21:21 Then those in Judea must flee to the hills. Those in Jerusalem must get out, and those out in the country should not return to the city.
42Lk 21:22 For those will be days of God's vengeance, and the prophetic words of the Scriptures will be fulfilled.
42Lk 21:23 How terrible it will be for pregnant women and for nursing mothers in those days. For there will be disaster in the land and great anger against this people.
42Lk 21:24 They will be killed by the sword or sent away as captives to all the nations of the world. And Jerusalem will be trampled down by the Gentiles until the period of the Gentiles comes to an end.
42Lk 21:25 "And there will be strange signs in the sun, moon, and stars. And here on earth the nations will be in turmoil, perplexed by the roaring seas and strange tides.
42Lk 21:26 People will be terrified at what they see coming upon the earth, for the powers in the heavens will be shaken.
42Lk 21:27 Then everyone will see the Son of Man®Á coming on a cloud with power and great glory®Ë. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself ®ËSee Dan 7.13
42Lk 21:28 So when all these things begin to happen, stand and look up, for your salvation is near!"
42Lk 21:29 Then he gave them this illustration£∫ "Notice the fig tree, or any other tree.
42Lk 21:30 When the leaves come out, you know without being told that summer is near.
42Lk 21:31 In the same way, when you see all these things taking place, you can know that the Kingdom of God is near.
42Lk 21:32 I tell you the truth, this generation will not pass from the scene until all these things have taken place.
42Lk 21:33 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear.
42Lk 21:34 "Watch out! Don't let your hearts be dulled by carousing and drunkenness, and by the worries of this life. Don't let that day catch you unaware,
42Lk 21:35 like a trap. For that day will come upon everyone living on the earth.
42Lk 21:36 Keep alert at all times. And pray that you might be strong enough to escape these coming horrors and stand before the Son of Man."
42Lk 21:37 Every day Jesus went to the Temple to teach, and each evening he returned to spend the night on the Mount of Olives.
42Lk 21:38 The crowds gathered at the Temple early each morning to hear him.
42Lk 22:1 The Festival of Unleavened Bread, which is also called Passover, was approaching.
42Lk 22:2 The leading priests and teachers of religious law were plotting how to kill Jesus, but they were afraid of the people's reaction.
42Lk 22:3 Then Satan entered into Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve disciples,
42Lk 22:4 and he went to the leading priests and captains of the Temple guard to discuss the best way to betray Jesus to them.
42Lk 22:5 They were delighted, and they promised to give him money.
42Lk 22:6 So he agreed and began looking for an opportunity to betray Jesus so they could arrest him when the crowds weren't around.
42Lk 22:7 Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread arrived, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed.
42Lk 22:8 Jesus sent Peter and John ahead and said, "Go and prepare the Passover meal, so we can eat it together."
42Lk 22:9 "Where do you want us to prepare it?" they asked him.
42Lk 22:10 He replied, "As soon as you enter Jerusalem, a man carrying a pitcher of water will meet you. Follow him. At the house he enters,
42Lk 22:11 say to the owner, `The Teacher asks£∫ Where is the guest room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?'
42Lk 22:12 He will take you upstairs to a large room that is already set up. That is where you should prepare our meal."
42Lk 22:13 They went off to the city and found everything just as Jesus had said, and they prepared the Passover meal there.
42Lk 22:14 When the time came, Jesus and the apostles sat down together at the table®Á. / ®ÁOr reclined together
42Lk 22:15 Jesus said, "I have been very eager to eat this Passover meal with you before my suffering begins.
42Lk 22:16 For I tell you now that I won't eat this meal again until its meaning is fulfilled in the Kingdom of God."
42Lk 22:17 Then he took a cup of wine and gave thanks to God for it. Then he said, "Take this and share it among yourselves.
42Lk 22:18 For I will not drink wine again until the Kingdom of God has come."
42Lk 22:19 He took some bread and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and gave it to the disciples, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Do this to remember me."
42Lk 22:20 After supper he took another cup of wine and said, "This cup is the new covenant between God and his people?an agreement confirmed with my blood, which is poured out as a sacrifice for you®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts omit 22.19b-20, which is given for you . . . which is poured out as a sacrifice for you
42Lk 22:21 "But here at this table, sitting among us as a friend, is the man who will betray me.
42Lk 22:22 For it has been determined that the Son of Man®Á must die. But what sorrow awaits the one who betrays him." / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
42Lk 22:23 The disciples began to ask each other which of them would ever do such a thing.
42Lk 22:24 Then they began to argue among themselves about who would be the greatest among them.
42Lk 22:25 Jesus told them, "In this world the kings and great men lord it over their people, yet they are called `friends of the people.'
42Lk 22:26 But among you it will be different. Those who are the greatest among you should take the lowest rank, and the leader should be like a servant.
42Lk 22:27 Who is more important, the one who sits at the table or the one who serves? The one who sits at the table, of course. But not here! For I am among you as one who serves.
42Lk 22:28 "You have stayed with me in my time of trial.
42Lk 22:29 And just as my Father has granted me a Kingdom, I now grant you the right
42Lk 22:30 to eat and drink at my table in my Kingdom. And you will sit on thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.
42Lk 22:31 "Simon, Simon, Satan has asked to sift each of you like wheat.
42Lk 22:32 But I have pleaded in prayer for you, Simon, that your faith should not fail. So when you have repented and turned to me again, strengthen your brothers."
42Lk 22:33 Peter said, "Lord, I am ready to go to prison with you, and even to die with you."
42Lk 22:34 But Jesus said, "Peter, let me tell you something. Before the rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me."
42Lk 22:35 Then Jesus asked them, "When I sent you out to preach the Good News and you did not have money, a traveler's bag, or extra clothing, did you need anything?" "No," they replied.
42Lk 22:36 "But now," he said, "take your money and a traveler's bag. And if you don't have a sword, sell your cloak and buy one!
42Lk 22:37 For the time has come for this prophecy about me to be fulfilled£∫ `He was counted among the rebels.'®Á Yes, everything written about me by the prophets will come true." / ®ÁIsa 53.12
42Lk 22:38 "Look, Lord," they replied, "we have two swords among us." "That's enough," he said.
42Lk 22:39 Then, accompanied by the disciples, Jesus left the upstairs room and went as usual to the Mount of Olives.
42Lk 22:40 There he told them, "Pray that you will not give in to temptation."
42Lk 22:41 He walked away, about a stone's throw, and knelt down and prayed,
42Lk 22:42 "Father, if you are willing, please take this cup of suffering away from me. Yet I want your will to be done, not mine."
42Lk 22:43 Then an angel from heaven appeared and strengthened him.
42Lk 22:44 He prayed more fervently, and he was in such agony of spirit that his sweat fell to the ground like great drops of blood®Á. / ®ÁVerses 43 and 44 are not included in many ancient manuscripts
42Lk 22:45 At last he stood up again and returned to the disciples, only to find them asleep, exhausted from grief.
42Lk 22:46 "Why are you sleeping?" he asked them. "Get up and pray, so that you will not give in to temptation."
42Lk 22:47 But even as Jesus said this, a crowd approached, led by Judas, one of the twelve disciples. Judas walked over to Jesus to greet him with a kiss.
42Lk 22:48 But Jesus said, "Judas, would you betray the Son of Man with a kiss?"
42Lk 22:49 When the other disciples saw what was about to happen, they exclaimed, "Lord, should we fight? We brought the swords!"
42Lk 22:50 And one of them struck at the high priest's slave, slashing off his right ear.
42Lk 22:51 But Jesus said, "No more of this." And he touched the man's ear and healed him.
42Lk 22:52 Then Jesus spoke to the leading priests, the captains of the Temple guard, and the elders who had come for him. "Am I some dangerous revolutionary," he asked, "that you come with swords and clubs to arrest me?
42Lk 22:53 Why didn't you arrest me in the Temple? I was there every day. But this is your moment, the time when the power of darkness reigns."
42Lk 22:54 So they arrested him and led him to the high priest's home. And Peter followed at a distance.
42Lk 22:55 The guards lit a fire in the middle of the courtyard and sat around it, and Peter joined them there.
42Lk 22:56 A servant girl noticed him in the firelight and began staring at him. Finally she said, "This man was one of Jesus' followers!"
42Lk 22:57 But Peter denied it. "Woman," he said, "I don't even know him!"
42Lk 22:58 After a while someone else looked at him and said, "You must be one of them!" "No, man, I'm not!" Peter retorted.
42Lk 22:59 About an hour later someone else insisted, "This must be one of them, because he is a Galilean, too."
42Lk 22:60 But Peter said, "Man, I don't know what you are talking about." And immediately, while he was still speaking, the rooster crowed.
42Lk 22:61 At that moment the Lord turned and looked at Peter. Suddenly, the Lord's words flashed through Peter's mind£∫ "Before the rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me."
42Lk 22:62 And Peter left the courtyard, weeping bitterly.
42Lk 22:63 The guards in charge of Jesus began mocking and beating him.
42Lk 22:64 They blindfolded him and said, "Prophesy to us! Who hit you that time?"
42Lk 22:65 And they hurled all sorts of terrible insults at him.
42Lk 22:66 At daybreak all the elders of the people assembled, including the leading priests and the teachers of religious law. Jesus was led before this high council®Á, / ®ÁGreek before their Sanhedrin
42Lk 22:67 and they said, "Tell us, are you the Messiah?" But he replied, "If I tell you, you won't believe me.
42Lk 22:68 And if I ask you a question, you won't answer.
42Lk 22:69 But from now on the Son of Man will be seated in the place of power at God's right hand®Á." / ®ÁSee Ps 110.1
42Lk 22:70 They all shouted, "So, are you claiming to be the Son of God?" And he replied, "You say that I am."
42Lk 22:71 "Why do we need other witnesses?" they said. "We ourselves heard him say it."
42Lk 23:1 Then the entire council took Jesus to Pilate, the Roman governor.
42Lk 23:2 They began to state their case£∫ "This man has been leading our people astray by telling them not to pay their taxes to the Roman government and by claiming he is the Messiah, a king."
42Lk 23:3 So Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus replied, "You have said it."
42Lk 23:4 Pilate turned to the leading priests and to the crowd and said, "I find nothing wrong with this man!"
42Lk 23:5 Then they became insistent. "But he is causing riots by his teaching wherever he goes?all over Judea, from Galilee to Jerusalem!"
42Lk 23:6 "Oh, is he a Galilean?" Pilate asked.
42Lk 23:7 When they said that he was, Pilate sent him to Herod Antipas, because Galilee was under Herod's jurisdiction, and Herod happened to be in Jerusalem at the time.
42Lk 23:8 Herod was delighted at the opportunity to see Jesus, because he had heard about him and had been hoping for a long time to see him perform a miracle.
42Lk 23:9 He asked Jesus question after question, but Jesus refused to answer.
42Lk 23:10 Meanwhile, the leading priests and the teachers of religious law stood there shouting their accusations.
42Lk 23:11 Then Herod and his soldiers began mocking and ridiculing Jesus. Finally, they put a royal robe on him and sent him back to Pilate.
42Lk 23:12 (Herod and Pilate, who had been enemies before, became friends that day)
42Lk 23:13 Then Pilate called together the leading priests and other religious leaders, along with the people,
42Lk 23:14 and he announced his verdict. "You brought this man to me, accusing him of leading a revolt. I have examined him thoroughly on this point in your presence and find him innocent.
42Lk 23:15 Herod came to the same conclusion and sent him back to us. Nothing this man has done calls for the death penalty.
42Lk 23:16 So I will have him flogged, and then I will release him."
42Lk 23:17 ®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts add verse 17, Now it was necessary for him to release one prisoner to them during the Passover celebration. Compare Matt 27.15; Mark 15.6; John 18.39
42Lk 23:18 Then a mighty roar rose from the crowd, and with one voice they shouted, "Kill him, and release Barabbas to us!"
42Lk 23:19 (Barabbas was in prison for taking part in an insurrection in Jerusalem against the government, and for murder.)
42Lk 23:20 Pilate argued with them, because he wanted to release Jesus.
42Lk 23:21 But they kept shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"
42Lk 23:22 For the third time he demanded, "Why? What crime has he committed? I have found no reason to sentence him to death. So I will have him flogged, and then I will release him."
42Lk 23:23 But the mob shouted louder and louder, demanding that Jesus be crucified, and their voices prevailed.
42Lk 23:24 So Pilate sentenced Jesus to die as they demanded.
42Lk 23:25 As they had requested, he released Barabbas, the man in prison for insurrection and murder. But he turned Jesus over to them to do as they wished.
42Lk 23:26 As they led Jesus away, a man named Simon, who was from Cyrene®Á, happened to be coming in from the countryside. The soldiers seized him and put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus. / ®ÁCyrene was a city in northern Africa
42Lk 23:27 A large crowd trailed behind, including many grief-stricken women.
42Lk 23:28 But Jesus turned and said to them, "Daughters of Jerusalem, don't weep for me, but weep for yourselves and for your children.
42Lk 23:29 For the days are coming when they will say, `Fortunate indeed are the women who are childless, the wombs that have not borne a child and the breasts that have never nursed.'
42Lk 23:30 People will beg the mountains, `Fall on us,' and plead with the hills, `Bury us.'®Á / ®ÁHos 10.8
42Lk 23:31 For if these things are done when the tree is green, what will happen when it is dry?®Á" / ®ÁOr If these things are done to me, the living tree, what will happen to you, the dry tree?
42Lk 23:32 Two others, both criminals, were led out to be executed with him.
42Lk 23:33 When they came to a place called The Skull®Á, they nailed him to the cross. And the criminals were also crucified?one on his right and one on his left. / ®ÁSometimes rendered Calvary, which comes from the Latin word for "skull."
42Lk 23:34 Jesus said, "Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they are doing."®Á And the soldiers gambled for his clothes by throwing dice®Ë. / ®ÁThis sentence is not included in many ancient manuscripts ®ËGreek by casting lots. See Ps 22.18
42Lk 23:35 The crowd watched and the leaders scoffed. "He saved others," they said, "let him save himself if he is really God's Messiah, the Chosen One."
42Lk 23:36 The soldiers mocked him, too, by offering him a drink of sour wine.
42Lk 23:37 They called out to him, "If you are the King of the Jews, save yourself!"
42Lk 23:38 A sign was fastened to the cross above him with these words£∫ "This is the King of the Jews."
42Lk 23:39 One of the criminals hanging beside him scoffed, "So you're the Messiah, are you? Prove it by saving yourself?and us, too, while you're at it!"
42Lk 23:40 But the other criminal protested, "Don't you fear God even when you have been sentenced to die?
42Lk 23:41 We deserve to die for our crimes, but this man hasn't done anything wrong."
42Lk 23:42 Then he said, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your Kingdom."
42Lk 23:43 And Jesus replied, "I assure you, today you will be with me in paradise."
42Lk 23:44 By this time it was noon, and darkness fell across the whole land until three o'clock.
42Lk 23:45 The light from the sun was gone. And suddenly, the curtain in the sanctuary of the Temple was torn down the middle.
42Lk 23:46 Then Jesus shouted, "Father, I entrust my spirit into your hands!"®Á And with those words he breathed his last. / ®ÁPs 31.5
42Lk 23:47 When the Roman officer®Á overseeing the execution saw what had happened, he worshiped God and said, "Surely this man was innocent®Ë." / ®ÁGreek the centurion ®ËOr righteous
42Lk 23:48 And when all the crowd that came to see the crucifixion saw what had happened, they went home in deep sorrow®Á. / ®ÁGreek went home beating their breasts
42Lk 23:49 But Jesus' friends, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, stood at a distance watching.
42Lk 23:50 Now there was a good and righteous man named Joseph. He was a member of the Jewish high council,
42Lk 23:51 but he had not agreed with the decision and actions of the other religious leaders. He was from the town of Arimathea in Judea, and he was waiting for the Kingdom of God to come.
42Lk 23:52 He went to Pilate and asked for Jesus' body.
42Lk 23:53 Then he took the body down from the cross and wrapped it in a long sheet of linen cloth and laid it in a new tomb that had been carved out of rock.
42Lk 23:54 This was done late on Friday afternoon, the day of preparation®Á, as the Sabbath was about to begin. / ®ÁGreek It was the day of preparation
42Lk 23:55 As his body was taken away, the women from Galilee followed and saw the tomb where his body was placed.
42Lk 23:56 Then they went home and prepared spices and ointments to anoint his body. But by the time they were finished the Sabbath had begun, so they rested as required by the law.
42Lk 24:1 But very early on Sunday morning®Á the women went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared. / ®ÁGreek But on the first day of the week, very early in the morning
42Lk 24:2 They found that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance.
42Lk 24:3 So they went in, but they didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus.
42Lk 24:4 As they stood there puzzled, two men suddenly appeared to them, clothed in dazzling robes.
42Lk 24:5 The women were terrified and bowed with their faces to the ground. Then the men asked, "Why are you looking among the dead for someone who is alive?
42Lk 24:6 He isn't here! He is risen from the dead! Remember what he told you back in Galilee,
42Lk 24:7 that the Son of Man®Á must be betrayed into the hands of sinful men and be crucified, and that he would rise again on the third day." / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
42Lk 24:8 Then they remembered that he had said this.
42Lk 24:9 So they rushed back from the tomb to tell his eleven disciples?and everyone else?what had happened.
42Lk 24:10 It was Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and several other women who told the apostles what had happened.
42Lk 24:11 But the story sounded like nonsense to the men, so they didn't believe it.
42Lk 24:12 However, Peter jumped up and ran to the tomb to look. Stooping, he peered in and saw the empty linen wrappings; then he went home again, wondering what had happened.
42Lk 24:13 That same day two of Jesus' followers were walking to the village of Emmaus, seven miles®Á from Jerusalem. / ®ÁGreek 60 stadia [11.1 kilometers]
42Lk 24:14 As they walked along they were talking about everything that had happened.
42Lk 24:15 As they talked and discussed these things, Jesus himself suddenly came and began walking with them.
42Lk 24:16 But God kept them from recognizing him.
42Lk 24:17 He asked them, "What are you discussing so intently as you walk along?" They stopped short, sadness written across their faces.
42Lk 24:18 Then one of them, Cleopas, replied, "You must be the only person in Jerusalem who hasn't heard about all the things that have happened there the last few days."
42Lk 24:19 "What things?" Jesus asked. "The things that happened to Jesus, the man from Nazareth," they said. "He was a prophet who did powerful miracles, and he was a mighty teacher in the eyes of God and all the people.
42Lk 24:20 But our leading priests and other religious leaders handed him over to be condemned to death, and they crucified him.
42Lk 24:21 We had hoped he was the Messiah who had come to rescue Israel. This all happened three days ago.
42Lk 24:22 "Then some women from our group of his followers were at his tomb early this morning, and they came back with an amazing report.
42Lk 24:23 They said his body was missing, and they had seen angels who told them Jesus is alive!
42Lk 24:24 Some of our men ran out to see, and sure enough, his body was gone, just as the women had said."
42Lk 24:25 Then Jesus said to them, "You foolish people! You find it so hard to believe all that the prophets wrote in the Scriptures.
42Lk 24:26 Wasn't it clearly predicted that the Messiah would have to suffer all these things before entering his glory?"
42Lk 24:27 Then Jesus took them through the writings of Moses and all the prophets, explaining from all the Scriptures the things concerning himself.
42Lk 24:28 By this time they were nearing Emmaus and the end of their journey. Jesus acted as if he were going on,
42Lk 24:29 but they begged him, "Stay the night with us, since it is getting late." So he went home with them.
42Lk 24:30 As they sat down to eat®Á, he took the bread and blessed it. Then he broke it and gave it to them. / ®ÁOr As they reclined
42Lk 24:31 Suddenly, their eyes were opened, and they recognized him. And at that moment he disappeared!
42Lk 24:32 They said to each other, "Didn't our hearts burn within us as he talked with us on the road and explained the Scriptures to us?"
42Lk 24:33 And within the hour they were on their way back to Jerusalem. There they found the eleven disciples and the others who had gathered with them,
42Lk 24:34 who said, "The Lord has really risen! He appeared to Peter®Á." / ®ÁGreek Simon
42Lk 24:35 Then the two from Emmaus told their story of how Jesus had appeared to them as they were walking along the road, and how they had recognized him as he was breaking the bread.
42Lk 24:36 And just as they were telling about it, Jesus himself was suddenly standing there among them. "Peace be with you," he said.
42Lk 24:37 But the whole group was startled and frightened, thinking they were seeing a ghost!
42Lk 24:38 "Why are you frightened?" he asked. "Why are your hearts filled with doubt?
42Lk 24:39 Look at my hands. Look at my feet. You can see that it's really me. Touch me and make sure that I am not a ghost, because ghosts don't have bodies, as you see that I do."
42Lk 24:40 As he spoke, he showed them his hands and his feet.
42Lk 24:41 Still they stood there in disbelief, filled with joy and wonder. Then he asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
42Lk 24:42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
42Lk 24:43 and he ate it as they watched.
42Lk 24:44 Then he said, "When I was with you before, I told you that everything written about me in the law of Moses and the prophets and in the Psalms must be fulfilled."
42Lk 24:45 Then he opened their minds to understand the Scriptures.
42Lk 24:46 And he said, "Yes, it was written long ago that the Messiah would suffer and die and rise from the dead on the third day.
42Lk 24:47 It was also written that this message would be proclaimed in the authority of his name to all the nations®Á, beginning in Jerusalem£∫ `There is forgiveness of sins for all who repent.' / ®ÁOr all peoples
42Lk 24:48 You are witnesses of all these things.
42Lk 24:49 "And now I will send the Holy Spirit, just as my Father promised. But stay here in the city until the Holy Spirit comes and fills you with power from heaven."
42Lk 24:50 Then Jesus led them to Bethany, and lifting his hands to heaven, he blessed them.
42Lk 24:51 While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up to heaven®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include and was taken up to heaven
42Lk 24:52 So they worshiped him and then returned to Jerusalem filled with great joy.
42Lk 24:53 And they spent all of their time in the Temple, praising God.

43Jn 1:1 In the beginning the Word already existed The Word was with God, and the Word was God.
43Jn 1:2 He existed in the beginning with God.
43Jn 1:3 God created everything through him, and nothing was created except through him.
43Jn 1:4 The Word gave life to everything that was created®Á, and his life brought light to everyone. / ®ÁOr and nothing that was created was created except through him. The Word gave life to everything
43Jn 1:5 The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness can never extinguish it®Á. / ®ÁOr and the darkness has not understood it
43Jn 1:6 God sent a man, John the Baptist®Á, / ®ÁGreek a man named John
43Jn 1:7 to tell about the light so that everyone might believe because of his testimony.
43Jn 1:8 John himself was not the light; he was simply a witness to tell about the light.
43Jn 1:9 The one who is the true light, who gives light to everyone, was coming into the world.
43Jn 1:10 He came into the very world he created, but the world didn't recognize him.
43Jn 1:11 He came to his own people, and even they rejected him.
43Jn 1:12 But to all who believed him and accepted him, he gave the right to become children of God.
43Jn 1:13 They are reborn?not with a physical birth resulting from human passion or plan, but a birth that comes from God.
43Jn 1:14 So the Word became human®Á and made his home among us. He was full of unfailing love and faithfulness®Ë. And we have seen his glory, the glory of the Father's one and only Son. / ®ÁGreek became flesh ®ËOr grace and truth; also in 1.17
43Jn 1:15 John testified about him when he shouted to the crowds, "This is the one I was talking about when I said, `Someone is coming after me who is far greater than I am, for he existed long before me.'"
43Jn 1:16 From his abundance we have all received one gracious blessing after another®Á. / ®ÁOr received the grace of Christ rather than the grace of the law; Greek reads received grace upon grace
43Jn 1:17 For the law was given through Moses, but God's unfailing love and faithfulness came through Jesus Christ.
43Jn 1:18 No one has ever seen God. But the unique One, who is himself God®Á, is near to the Father's heart. He has revealed God to us. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read But the one and only Son
43Jn 1:19 This was John's testimony when the Jewish leaders sent priests and Temple assistants®Á from Jerusalem to ask John, "Who are you?" / ®ÁGreek and Levites
43Jn 1:20 He came right out and said, "I am not the Messiah."
43Jn 1:21 "Well then, who are you?" they asked. "Are you Elijah?" "No," he replied "Are you the Prophet we are expecting?"®Á "No." / ®ÁGreek Are you the Prophet? See Deut 18.15, 18; Mal 4.5-6
43Jn 1:22 "Then who are you? We need an answer for those who sent us. What do you have to say about yourself?"
43Jn 1:23 John replied in the words of the prophet Isaiah£∫ "I am a voice shouting in the wilderness, `Clear the way for the LORD's coming!'"®Á / ®ÁIsa 40.3
43Jn 1:24 Then the Pharisees who had been sent
43Jn 1:25 asked him, "If you aren't the Messiah or Elijah or the Prophet, what right do you have to baptize?"
43Jn 1:26 John told them, "I baptize with®Á water, but right here in the crowd is someone you do not recognize. / ®ÁOr in; also in 1.31, 33
43Jn 1:27 Though his ministry follows mine, I'm not even worthy to be his slave and untie the straps of his sandal."
43Jn 1:28 This encounter took place in Bethany, an area east of the Jordan River, where John was baptizing.
43Jn 1:29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look! The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
43Jn 1:30 He is the one I was talking about when I said, `A man is coming after me who is far greater than I am, for he existed long before me.'
43Jn 1:31 I did not recognize him as the Messiah, but I have been baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel."
43Jn 1:32 Then John testified, "I saw the Holy Spirit descending like a dove from heaven and resting upon him.
43Jn 1:33 I didn't know he was the one, but when God sent me to baptize with water, he told me, `The one on whom you see the Spirit descend and rest is the one who will baptize with the Holy Spirit.'
43Jn 1:34 I saw this happen to Jesus, so I testify that he is the Chosen One of God®Á." / ®ÁSome manuscripts read the Son of God
43Jn 1:35 The following day John was again standing with two of his disciples.
43Jn 1:36 As Jesus walked by, John looked at him and declared, "Look! There is the Lamb of God!"
43Jn 1:37 When John's two disciples heard this, they followed Jesus.
43Jn 1:38 Jesus looked around and saw them following. "What do you want?" he asked them They replied, "Rabbi" (which means "Teacher"), "where are you staying?"
43Jn 1:39 "Come and see," he said. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon when they went with him to the place where he was staying, and they remained with him the rest of the day.
43Jn 1:40 Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of these men who heard what John said and then followed Jesus.
43Jn 1:41 Andrew went to find his brother, Simon, and told him, "We have found the Messiah" (which means "Christ"®Á). / ®ÁChrist means "the anointed one."
43Jn 1:42 Then Andrew brought Simon to meet Jesus. Looking intently at Simon, Jesus said, "Your name is Simon, son of John - but you will be called Cephas" ®Á(which means "Peter"®Á). / ®ÁThe names Cephas (from Aramaic) and Peter (from Greek) both mean "rock."
43Jn 1:43 The next day Jesus decided to go to Galilee. He found Philip and said to him, "Come, follow me."
43Jn 1:44 Philip was from Bethsaida, Andrew and Peter's hometown.
43Jn 1:45 Philip went to look for Nathanael and told him, "We have found the very person Moses®Á and the prophets wrote about! His name is Jesus, the son of Joseph from Nazareth." / ®ÁGreek Moses in the law
43Jn 1:46 "Nazareth!" exclaimed Nathanael. "Can anything good come from Nazareth?" "Come and see for yourself," Philip replied.
43Jn 1:47 As they approached, Jesus said, "Now here is a genuine son of Israel?a man of complete integrity."
43Jn 1:48 "How do you know about me?" Nathanael asked Jesus replied, "I could see you under the fig tree before Philip found you."
43Jn 1:49 Then Nathanael exclaimed, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God?the King of Israel!"
43Jn 1:50 Jesus asked him, "Do you believe this just because I told you I had seen you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than this."
43Jn 1:51 Then he said, "I tell you the truth, you will all see heaven open and the angels of God going up and down on the Son of Man, the one who is the stairway between heaven and earth®Á." / ®ÁGreek going up and down on the Son of Man; see Gen 28.10-17. "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
43Jn 2:1 The next day®Á there was a wedding celebration in the village of Cana in Galilee. Jesus' mother was there, / ®ÁGreek On the third day; see 1.35, 43
43Jn 2:2 and Jesus and his disciples were also invited to the celebration.
43Jn 2:3 The wine supply ran out during the festivities, so Jesus' mother told him, "They have no more wine."
43Jn 2:4 "Dear woman, that's not our problem," Jesus replied. "My time has not yet come."
43Jn 2:5 But his mother told the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."
43Jn 2:6 Standing nearby were six stone water jars, used for Jewish ceremonial washing. Each could hold twenty to thirty gallons®Á. / ®ÁGreek 2 or 3 measures [75 to 113 liters]
43Jn 2:7 Jesus told the servants, "Fill the jars with water." When the jars had been filled,
43Jn 2:8 he said, "Now dip some out, and take it to the master of ceremonies." So the servants followed his instructions.
43Jn 2:9 When the master of ceremonies tasted the water that was now wine, not knowing where it had come from (though, of course, the servants knew), he called the bridegroom over.
43Jn 2:10 "A host always serves the best wine first," he said. "Then, when everyone has had a lot to drink, he brings out the less expensive wine. But you have kept the best until now!"
43Jn 2:11 This miraculous sign at Cana in Galilee was the first time Jesus revealed his glory. And his disciples believed in him.
43Jn 2:12 After the wedding he went to Capernaum for a few days with his mother, his brothers, and his disciples.
43Jn 2:13 It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover celebration, so Jesus went to Jerusalem.
43Jn 2:14 In the Temple area he saw merchants selling cattle, sheep, and doves for sacrifices; he also saw dealers at tables exchanging foreign money.
43Jn 2:15 Jesus made a whip from some ropes and chased them all out of the Temple. He drove out the sheep and cattle, scattered the money changers' coins over the floor, and turned over their tables.
43Jn 2:16 Then, going over to the people who sold doves, he told them, "Get these things out of here. Stop turning my Father's house into a marketplace!"
43Jn 2:17 Then his disciples remembered this prophecy from the Scriptures£∫ "Passion for God's house will consume me."®Á / ®ÁOr "Concern for God's house will be my undoing." Ps 69.9
43Jn 2:18 But the Jewish leaders demanded, "What are you doing? If God gave you authority to do this, show us a miraculous sign to prove it."
43Jn 2:19 "All right," Jesus replied. "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."
43Jn 2:20 "What!" they exclaimed. "It has taken forty-six years to build this Temple, and you can rebuild it in three days?"
43Jn 2:21 But when Jesus said "this temple," he meant his own body.
43Jn 2:22 After he was raised from the dead, his disciples remembered he had said this, and they believed both the Scriptures and what Jesus had said.
43Jn 2:23 Because of the miraculous signs Jesus did in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration, many began to trust in him.
43Jn 2:24 But Jesus didn't trust them, because he knew human nature.
43Jn 2:25 No one needed to tell him what mankind is really like.
43Jn 3:1 There was a man named Nicodemus, a Jewish religious leader who was a Pharisee.
43Jn 3:2 After dark one evening, he came to speak with Jesus. "Rabbi," he said, "we all know that God has sent you to teach us. Your miraculous signs are evidence that God is with you."
43Jn 3:3 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, unless you are born again®Á, you cannot see the Kingdom of God." / ®ÁOr born from above; also in 3.7
43Jn 3:4 "What do you mean?" exclaimed Nicodemus. "How can an old man go back into his mother's womb and be born again?"
43Jn 3:5 Jesus replied, "I assure you, no one can enter the Kingdom of God without being born of water and the Spirit®Á. / ®ÁOr and spirit. The Greek word for Spirit can also be translated wind; see 3.8
43Jn 3:6 Humans can reproduce only human life, but the Holy Spirit gives birth to spiritual life®Á. / ®ÁGreek what is born of the Spirit is spirit
43Jn 3:7 So don't be surprised when I say, `You®Á must be born again.' / ®ÁThe Greek word for you is plural; also in 3.12
43Jn 3:8 The wind blows wherever it wants. Just as you can hear the wind but can't tell where it comes from or where it is going, so you can't explain how people are born of the Spirit."
43Jn 3:9 "How are these things possible?" Nicodemus asked.
43Jn 3:10 Jesus replied, "You are a respected Jewish teacher, and yet you don't understand these things?
43Jn 3:11 I assure you, we tell you what we know and have seen, and yet you won't believe our testimony.
43Jn 3:12 But if you don't believe me when I tell you about earthly things, how can you possibly believe if I tell you about heavenly things?
43Jn 3:13 No one has ever gone to heaven and returned. But the Son of Man®Á has come down from heaven. / ®ÁSome manuscripts add who lives in heaven. "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
43Jn 3:14 And as Moses lifted up the bronze snake on a pole in the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up,
43Jn 3:15 so that everyone who believes in him will have eternal life®Á. / ®ÁOr everyone who believes will have eternal life in him
43Jn 3:16 "For God loved the world so much that he gave his one and only Son, so that everyone who believes in him will not perish but have eternal life.
43Jn 3:17 God sent his Son into the world not to judge the world, but to save the world through him.
43Jn 3:18 "There is no judgment against anyone who believes in him. But anyone who does not believe in him has already been judged for not believing in God's one and only Son.
43Jn 3:19 And the judgment is based on this fact£∫ God's light came into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light, for their actions were evil.
43Jn 3:20 All who do evil hate the light and refuse to go near it for fear their sins will be exposed.
43Jn 3:21 But those who do what is right come to the light so others can see that they are doing what God wants®Á." / ®ÁOr can see God at work in what he is doing
43Jn 3:22 Then Jesus and his disciples left Jerusalem and went into the Judean countryside. Jesus spent some time with them there, baptizing people.
43Jn 3:23 At this time John the Baptist was baptizing at Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there; and people kept coming to him for baptism.
43Jn 3:24 (This was before John was thrown into prison.)
43Jn 3:25 A debate broke out between John's disciples and a certain Jew®Á over ceremonial cleansing. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read some Jews
43Jn 3:26 So John's disciples came to him and said, "Rabbi, the man you met on the other side of the Jordan River, the one you identified as the Messiah, is also baptizing people. And everybody is going to him instead of coming to us."
43Jn 3:27 John replied, "No one can receive anything unless God gives it from heaven.
43Jn 3:28 You yourselves know how plainly I told you, `I am not the Messiah. I am only here to prepare the way for him.'
43Jn 3:29 It is the bridegroom who marries the bride, and the best man is simply glad to stand with him and hear his vows. Therefore, I am filled with joy at his success.
43Jn 3:30 He must become greater and greater, and I must become less and less.
43Jn 3:31 "He has come from above and is greater than anyone else. We are of the earth, and we speak of earthly things, but he has come from heaven and is greater than anyone else®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts omit and is greater than anyone else
43Jn 3:32 He testifies about what he has seen and heard, but how few believe what he tells them!
43Jn 3:33 Anyone who accepts his testimony can affirm that God is true.
43Jn 3:34 For he is sent by God. He speaks God's words, for God gives him the Spirit without limit.
43Jn 3:35 The Father loves his Son and has put everything into his hands.
43Jn 3:36 And anyone who believes in God's Son has eternal life. Anyone who doesn't obey the Son will never experience eternal life but remains under God's angry judgment."
43Jn 4:1 Jesus®Á knew the Pharisees had heard that he was baptizing and making more disciples than John / ®ÁSome manuscripts read The Lord
43Jn 4:2 (though Jesus himself didn't baptize them - his disciples did.)
43Jn 4:3 So he left Judea and returned to Galilee.
43Jn 4:4 He had to go through Samaria on the way.
43Jn 4:5 Eventually he came to the Samaritan village of Sychar, near the field that Jacob gave to his son Joseph.
43Jn 4:6 Jacob's well was there; and Jesus, tired from the long walk, sat wearily beside the well about noontime.
43Jn 4:7 Soon a Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, "Please give me a drink."
43Jn 4:8 He was alone at the time because his disciples had gone into the village to buy some food.
43Jn 4:9 The woman was surprised, for Jews refuse to have anything to do with Samaritans®Á. She said to Jesus, "You are a Jew, and I am a Samaritan woman. Why are you asking me for a drink?" / ®ÁSome manuscripts omit this sentence
43Jn 4:10 Jesus replied, "If you only knew the gift God has for you and who you are speaking to, you would ask me, and I would give you living water."
43Jn 4:11 "But sir, you don't have a rope or a bucket," she said, "and this well is very deep. Where would you get this living water?
43Jn 4:12 And besides, do you think you're greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us this well? How can you offer better water than he and his sons and his animals enjoyed?"
43Jn 4:13 Jesus replied, "Anyone who drinks this water will soon become thirsty again.
43Jn 4:14 But those who drink the water I give will never be thirsty again. It becomes a fresh, bubbling spring within them, giving them eternal life."
43Jn 4:15 "Please, sir," the woman said, "give me this water! Then I'll never be thirsty again, and I won't have to come here to get water."
43Jn 4:16 "Go and get your husband," Jesus told her.
43Jn 4:17 "I don't have a husband," the woman replied. Jesus said, "You're right! You don't have a husband?
43Jn 4:18 for you have had five husbands, and you aren't even married to the man you're living with now. You certainly spoke the truth!"
43Jn 4:19 "Sir," the woman said, "you must be a prophet.
43Jn 4:20 So tell me, why is it that you Jews insist that Jerusalem is the only place of worship, while we Samaritans claim it is here at Mount Gerizim®Á, where our ancestors worshiped?" / ®ÁGreek on this mountain
43Jn 4:21 Jesus replied, "Believe me, dear woman, the time is coming when it will no longer matter whether you worship the Father on this mountain or in Jerusalem.
43Jn 4:22 You Samaritans know very little about the one you worship, while we Jews know all about him, for salvation comes through the Jews.
43Jn 4:23 But the time is coming - indeed it's here now - when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and in truth. The Father is looking for those who will worship him that way.
43Jn 4:24 For God is Spirit, so those who worship him must worship in spirit and in truth."
43Jn 4:25 The woman said, "I know the Messiah is coming?the one who is called Christ. When he comes, he will explain everything to us."
43Jn 4:26 Then Jesus told her, "I AM the Messiah!"®Á / ®ÁOr "The `I AM' is here"; or "I am the LORD"; Greek reads "I am, the one speaking to you." See Exod 3.14
43Jn 4:27 Just then his disciples came back. They were shocked to find him talking to a woman, but none of them had the nerve to ask, "What do you want with her?" or "Why are you talking to her?"
43Jn 4:28 The woman left her water jar beside the well and ran back to the village, telling everyone,
43Jn 4:29 "Come and see a man who told me everything I ever did! Could he possibly be the Messiah?"
43Jn 4:30 So the people came streaming from the village to see him.
43Jn 4:31 Meanwhile, the disciples were urging Jesus, "Rabbi, eat something."
43Jn 4:32 But Jesus replied, "I have a kind of food you know nothing about."
43Jn 4:33 "Did someone bring him food while we were gone?" the disciples asked each other.
43Jn 4:34 Then Jesus explained£∫ "My nourishment comes from doing the will of God, who sent me, and from finishing his work.
43Jn 4:35 You know the saying, `Four months between planting and harvest.' But I say, wake up and look around. The fields are already ripe®Á for harvest. / ®ÁGreek white
43Jn 4:36 The harvesters are paid good wages, and the fruit they harvest is people brought to eternal life. What joy awaits both the planter and the harvester alike!
43Jn 4:37 You know the saying, `One plants and another harvests.' And it's true.
43Jn 4:38 I sent you to harvest where you didn't plant; others had already done the work, and now you will get to gather the harvest."
43Jn 4:39 Many Samaritans from the village believed in Jesus because the woman had said, "He told me everything I ever did!"
43Jn 4:40 When they came out to see him, they begged him to stay in their village. So he stayed for two days,
43Jn 4:41 long enough for many more to hear his message and believe.
43Jn 4:42 Then they said to the woman, "Now we believe, not just because of what you told us, but because we have heard him ourselves. Now we know that he is indeed the Savior of the world."
43Jn 4:43 At the end of the two days, Jesus went on to Galilee.
43Jn 4:44 He himself had said that a prophet is not honored in his own hometown.
43Jn 4:45 Yet the Galileans welcomed him, for they had been in Jerusalem at the Passover celebration and had seen everything he did there.
43Jn 4:46 As he traveled through Galilee, he came to Cana, where he had turned the water into wine. There was a government official in nearby Capernaum whose son was very sick.
43Jn 4:47 When he heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went and begged Jesus to come to Capernaum to heal his son, who was about to die.
43Jn 4:48 Jesus asked, "Will you never believe in me unless you see miraculous signs and wonders?"
43Jn 4:49 The official pleaded, "Lord, please come now before my little boy dies."
43Jn 4:50 Then Jesus told him, "Go back home. Your son will live!" And the man believed what Jesus said and started home.
43Jn 4:51 While the man was on his way, some of his servants met him with the news that his son was alive and well.
43Jn 4:52 He asked them when the boy had begun to get better, and they replied, "Yesterday afternoon at one o'clock his fever suddenly disappeared!"
43Jn 4:53 Then the father realized that that was the very time Jesus had told him, "Your son will live." And he and his entire household believed in Jesus.
43Jn 4:54 This was the second miraculous sign Jesus did in Galilee after coming from Judea.
43Jn 5:1 Afterward Jesus returned to Jerusalem for one of the Jewish holy days.
43Jn 5:2 Inside the city, near the Sheep Gate, was the pool of Bethesda®Á, with five covered porches. / ®ÁOther manuscripts read Beth-zatha; still others read Bethsaida
43Jn 5:3 Crowds of sick people?blind, lame, or paralyzed?lay on the porches.
43Jn 5:4 ®Á / ®ÁSome manuscripts add an expanded conclusion to verse 3 and all of verse 4£∫ waiting for a certain movement of the water, 4for an angel of the Lord came from time to time and stirred up the water. And the first person to step in after the water was stirred was healed of whatever disease he had
43Jn 5:5 One of the men lying there had been sick for thirty-eight years.
43Jn 5:6 When Jesus saw him and knew he had been ill for a long time, he asked him, "Would you like to get well?"
43Jn 5:7 "I can't, sir," the sick man said, "for I have no one to put me into the pool when the water bubbles up. Someone else always gets there ahead of me."
43Jn 5:8 Jesus told him, "Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk!"
43Jn 5:9 Instantly, the man was healed! He rolled up his sleeping mat and began walking! But this miracle happened on the Sabbath,
43Jn 5:10 so the Jewish leaders objected. They said to the man who was cured, "You can't work on the Sabbath! The law doesn't allow you to carry that sleeping mat!"
43Jn 5:11 But he replied, "The man who healed me told me, `Pick up your mat and walk.'"
43Jn 5:12 "Who said such a thing as that?" they demanded.
43Jn 5:13 The man didn't know, for Jesus had disappeared into the crowd.
43Jn 5:14 But afterward Jesus found him in the Temple and told him, "Now you are well; so stop sinning, or something even worse may happen to you."
43Jn 5:15 Then the man went and told the Jewish leaders that it was Jesus who had healed him.
43Jn 5:16 So the Jewish leaders began harassing®Á Jesus for breaking the Sabbath rules. / ®ÁOr persecuting
43Jn 5:17 But Jesus replied, "My Father is always working, and so am I."
43Jn 5:18 So the Jewish leaders tried all the harder to find a way to kill him. For he not only broke the Sabbath, he called God his Father, thereby making himself equal with God.
43Jn 5:19 So Jesus explained, "I tell you the truth, the Son can do nothing by himself. He does only what he sees the Father doing. Whatever the Father does, the Son also does.
43Jn 5:20 For the Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing. In fact, the Father will show him how to do even greater works than healing this man. Then you will truly be astonished.
43Jn 5:21 For just as the Father gives life to those he raises from the dead, so the Son gives life to anyone he wants.
43Jn 5:22 In addition, the Father judges no one. Instead, he has given the Son absolute authority to judge,
43Jn 5:23 so that everyone will honor the Son, just as they honor the Father. Anyone who does not honor the Son is certainly not honoring the Father who sent him.
43Jn 5:24 "I tell you the truth, those who listen to my message and believe in God who sent me have eternal life. They will never be condemned for their sins, but they have already passed from death into life.
43Jn 5:25 "And I assure you that the time is coming, indeed it's here now, when the dead will hear my voice?the voice of the Son of God. And those who listen will live.
43Jn 5:26 The Father has life in himself, and he has granted that same life-giving power to his Son.
43Jn 5:27 And he has given him authority to judge everyone because he is the Son of Man®Á. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
43Jn 5:28 Don't be so surprised! Indeed, the time is coming when all the dead in their graves will hear the voice of God's Son,
43Jn 5:29 and they will rise again. Those who have done good will rise to experience eternal life, and those who have continued in evil will rise to experience judgment.
43Jn 5:30 I can do nothing on my own. I judge as God tells me. Therefore, my judgment is just, because I carry out the will of the one who sent me, not my own will.
43Jn 5:31 "If I were to testify on my own behalf, my testimony would not be valid.
43Jn 5:32 But someone else is also testifying about me, and I assure you that everything he says about me is true.
43Jn 5:33 In fact, you sent investigators to listen to John the Baptist, and his testimony about me was true.
43Jn 5:34 Of course, I have no need of human witnesses, but I say these things so you might be saved.
43Jn 5:35 John was like a burning and shining lamp, and you were excited for a while about his message.
43Jn 5:36 But I have a greater witness than John?my teachings and my miracles. The Father gave me these works to accomplish, and they prove that he sent me.
43Jn 5:37 And the Father who sent me has testified about me himself. You have never heard his voice or seen him face to face,
43Jn 5:38 and you do not have his message in your hearts, because you do not believe me?the one he sent to you.
43Jn 5:39 "You search the Scriptures because you think they give you eternal life. But the Scriptures point to me!
43Jn 5:40 Yet you refuse to come to me to receive this life.
43Jn 5:41 "Your approval means nothing to me,
43Jn 5:42 because I know you don't have God's love within you.
43Jn 5:43 For I have come to you in my Father's name, and you have rejected me. Yet if others come in their own name, you gladly welcome them.
43Jn 5:44 No wonder you can't believe! For you gladly honor each other, but you don't care about the honor that comes from the one who alone is God®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read from the only One
43Jn 5:45 "Yet it isn't I who will accuse you before the Father. Moses will accuse you! Yes, Moses, in whom you put your hopes.
43Jn 5:46 If you really believed Moses, you would believe me, because he wrote about me.
43Jn 5:47 But since you don't believe what he wrote, how will you believe what I say?"
43Jn 6:1 After this, Jesus crossed over to the far side of the Sea of Galilee, also known as the Sea of Tiberias.
43Jn 6:2 A huge crowd kept following him wherever he went, because they saw his miraculous signs as he healed the sick.
43Jn 6:3 Then Jesus climbed a hill and sat down with his disciples around him.
43Jn 6:4 (It was nearly time for the Jewish Passover celebration.)
43Jn 6:5 Jesus soon saw a huge crowd of people coming to look for him. Turning to Philip, he asked, "Where can we buy bread to feed all these people?"
43Jn 6:6 He was testing Philip, for he already knew what he was going to do.
43Jn 6:7 Philip replied, "Even if we worked for months, we wouldn't have enough money®Á to feed them!" / ®ÁGreek Two hundred denarii would not be enough. A denarius was equivalent to a laborer's full day's wage
43Jn 6:8 Then Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, spoke up.
43Jn 6:9 "There's a young boy here with five barley loaves and two fish. But what good is that with this huge crowd?"
43Jn 6:10 "Tell everyone to sit down," Jesus said. So they all sat down on the grassy slopes. ®Á / ®ÁThe men alone numbered about 5,000
43Jn 6:11 Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks to God, and distributed them to the people. Afterward he did the same with the fish. And they all ate as much as they wanted.
43Jn 6:12 After everyone was full, Jesus told his disciples, "Now gather the leftovers, so that nothing is wasted."
43Jn 6:13 So they picked up the pieces and filled twelve baskets with scraps left by the people who had eaten from the five barley loaves.
43Jn 6:14 When the people saw him®Á do this miraculous sign, they exclaimed, "Surely, he is the Prophet we have been expecting!"®Ë / ®ÁSome manuscripts read Jesus ®ËSee Deut 18.15, 18; Mal 4.5-6
43Jn 6:15 When Jesus saw that they were ready to force him to be their king, he slipped away into the hills by himself.
43Jn 6:16 That evening Jesus' disciples went down to the shore to wait for him.
43Jn 6:17 But as darkness fell and Jesus still hadn't come back, they got into the boat and headed across the lake toward Capernaum.
43Jn 6:18 Soon a gale swept down upon them, and the sea grew very rough.
43Jn 6:19 They had rowed three or four miles®Á when suddenly they saw Jesus walking on the water toward the boat. They were terrified, / ®ÁGreek 25 or 30 stadia [4.6 or 5.5 kilometers]
43Jn 6:20 but he called out to them, "Don't be afraid. I am here!®Á" / ®ÁOr The `I AM' is here; Greek reads I am. See Exod 3.14
43Jn 6:21 Then they were eager to let him in the boat, and immediately they arrived at their destination!
43Jn 6:22 The next day the crowd that had stayed on the far shore saw that the disciples had taken the only boat, and they realized Jesus had not gone with them.
43Jn 6:23 Several boats from Tiberias landed near the place where the Lord had blessed the bread and the people had eaten.
43Jn 6:24 So when the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into the boats and went across to Capernaum to look for him.
43Jn 6:25 They found him on the other side of the lake and asked, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"
43Jn 6:26 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, you want to be with me because I fed you, not because you understood the miraculous signs.
43Jn 6:27 But don't be so concerned about perishable things like food. Spend your energy seeking the eternal life that the Son of Man®Á can give you. For God the Father has given me the seal of his approval." / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
43Jn 6:28 They replied, "We want to perform God's works, too. What should we do?"
43Jn 6:29 Jesus told them, "This is the only work God wants from you£∫ Believe in the one he has sent."
43Jn 6:30 They answered, "Show us a miraculous sign if you want us to believe in you. What can you do?
43Jn 6:31 After all, our ancestors ate manna while they journeyed through the wilderness! The Scriptures say, `Moses gave them bread from heaven to eat.'®Á" / ®ÁExod 16.4; Ps 78.24
43Jn 6:32 Jesus said, "I tell you the truth, Moses didn't give you bread from heaven. My Father did. And now he offers you the true bread from heaven.
43Jn 6:33 The true bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."
43Jn 6:34 "Sir," they said, "give us that bread every day."
43Jn 6:35 Jesus replied, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never be hungry again. Whoever believes in me will never be thirsty.
43Jn 6:36 But you haven't believed in me even though you have seen me.
43Jn 6:37 However, those the Father has given me will come to me, and I will never reject them.
43Jn 6:38 For I have come down from heaven to do the will of God who sent me, not to do my own will.
43Jn 6:39 And this is the will of God, that I should not lose even one of all those he has given me, but that I should raise them up at the last day.
43Jn 6:40 For it is my Father's will that all who see his Son and believe in him should have eternal life. I will raise them up at the last day."
43Jn 6:41 Then the people®Á began to murmur in disagreement because he had said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven." / ®ÁGreek Jewish people; also in 6.52
43Jn 6:42 They said, "Isn't this Jesus, the son of Joseph? We know his father and mother. How can he say, `I came down from heaven'?"
43Jn 6:43 But Jesus replied, "Stop complaining about what I said.
43Jn 6:44 For no one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws them to me, and at the last day I will raise them up.
43Jn 6:45 As it is written in the Scriptures®Á, `They will all be taught by God.' Everyone who listens to the Father and learns from him comes to me. / ®ÁGreek in the prophets. Isa 54.13
43Jn 6:46 (Not that anyone has ever seen the Father; only I, who was sent from God, have seen him.)
43Jn 6:47 "I tell you the truth, anyone who believes has eternal life.
43Jn 6:48 Yes, I am the bread of life!
43Jn 6:49 Your ancestors ate manna in the wilderness, but they all died.
43Jn 6:50 Anyone who eats the bread from heaven, however, will never die.
43Jn 6:51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will live forever; and this bread, which I will offer so the world may live, is my flesh."
43Jn 6:52 Then the people began arguing with each other about what he meant. "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" they asked.
43Jn 6:53 So Jesus said again, "I tell you the truth, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you cannot have eternal life within you.
43Jn 6:54 But anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise that person at the last day.
43Jn 6:55 For my flesh is true food, and my blood is true drink.
43Jn 6:56 Anyone who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.
43Jn 6:57 I live because of the living Father who sent me; in the same way, anyone who feeds on me will live because of me.
43Jn 6:58 I am the true bread that came down from heaven. Anyone who eats this bread will not die as your ancestors did (even though they ate the manna) but will live forever."
43Jn 6:59 He said these things while he was teaching in the synagogue in Capernaum.
43Jn 6:60 Many of his disciples said, "This is very hard to understand. How can anyone accept it?"
43Jn 6:61 Jesus was aware that his disciples were complaining, so he said to them, "Does this offend you?
43Jn 6:62 Then what will you think if you see the Son of Man ascend to heaven again?
43Jn 6:63 The Spirit alone gives eternal life. Human effort accomplishes nothing. And the very words I have spoken to you are spirit and life.
43Jn 6:64 But some of you do not believe me." (For Jesus knew from the beginning which ones didn't believe, and he knew who would betray him.)
43Jn 6:65 Then he said, "That is why I said that people can't come to me unless the Father gives them to me."
43Jn 6:66 At this point many of his disciples turned away and deserted him.
43Jn 6:67 Then Jesus turned to the Twelve and asked, "Are you also going to leave?"
43Jn 6:68 Simon Peter replied, "Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words that give eternal life.
43Jn 6:69 We believe, and we know you are the Holy One of God®Á." / ®ÁOther manuscripts read you are the Christ, the Holy One of God; still others read you are the Christ, the Son of God; and still others read you are the Christ, the Son of the living God
43Jn 6:70 Then Jesus said, "I chose the twelve of you, but one is a devil."
43Jn 6:71 He was speaking of Judas, son of Simon Iscariot, one of the Twelve, who would later betray him.
43Jn 7:1 After this, Jesus traveled around Galilee. He wanted to stay out of Judea, where the Jewish leaders were plotting his death.
43Jn 7:2 But soon it was time for the Jewish Festival of Shelters,
43Jn 7:3 and Jesus' brothers said to him, "Leave here and go to Judea, where your followers can see your miracles!
43Jn 7:4 You can't become famous if you hide like this! If you can do such wonderful things, show yourself to the world!"
43Jn 7:5 For even his brothers didn't believe in him.
43Jn 7:6 Jesus replied, "Now is not the right time for me to go, but you can go anytime.
43Jn 7:7 The world can't hate you, but it does hate me because I accuse it of doing evil.
43Jn 7:8 You go on. I'm not going®Á to this festival, because my time has not yet come." / ®ÁSome manuscripts read not yet going
43Jn 7:9 After saying these things, Jesus remained in Galilee.
43Jn 7:10 But after his brothers left for the festival, Jesus also went, though secretly, staying out of public view.
43Jn 7:11 The Jewish leaders tried to find him at the festival and kept asking if anyone had seen him.
43Jn 7:12 There was a lot of grumbling about him among the crowds. Some argued, "He's a good man," but others said, "He's nothing but a fraud who deceives the people."
43Jn 7:13 But no one had the courage to speak favorably about him in public, for they were afraid of getting in trouble with the Jewish leaders.
43Jn 7:14 Then, midway through the festival, Jesus went up to the Temple and began to teach.
43Jn 7:15 The people®Á were surprised when they heard him. "How does he know so much when he hasn't been trained?" they asked. / ®ÁGreek Jewish people
43Jn 7:16 So Jesus told them, "My message is not my own; it comes from God who sent me.
43Jn 7:17 Anyone who wants to do the will of God will know whether my teaching is from God or is merely my own.
43Jn 7:18 Those who speak for themselves want glory only for themselves, but a person who seeks to honor the one who sent him speaks truth, not lies.
43Jn 7:19 Moses gave you the law, but none of you obeys it! In fact, you are trying to kill me."
43Jn 7:20 The crowd replied, "You're demon possessed! Who's trying to kill you?"
43Jn 7:21 Jesus replied, "I did one miracle on the Sabbath, and you were amazed.
43Jn 7:22 But you work on the Sabbath, too, when you obey Moses' law of circumcision. ®Á / ®ÁActually, this tradition of circumcision began with the patriarchs, long before the law of Moses
43Jn 7:23 For if the correct time for circumcising your son falls on the Sabbath, you go ahead and do it so as not to break the law of Moses. So why should you be angry with me for healing a man on the Sabbath?
43Jn 7:24 Look beneath the surface so you can judge correctly."
43Jn 7:25 Some of the people who lived in Jerusalem started to ask each other, "Isn't this the man they are trying to kill?
43Jn 7:26 But here he is, speaking in public, and they say nothing to him. Could our leaders possibly believe that he is the Messiah?
43Jn 7:27 But how could he be? For we know where this man comes from. When the Messiah comes, he will simply appear; no one will know where he comes from."
43Jn 7:28 While Jesus was teaching in the Temple, he called out, "Yes, you know me, and you know where I come from. But I'm not here on my own. The one who sent me is true, and you don't know him.
43Jn 7:29 But I know him because I come from him, and he sent me to you."
43Jn 7:30 Then the leaders tried to arrest him; but no one laid a hand on him, because his time®Á had not yet come. / ®ÁGreek his hour
43Jn 7:31 Many among the crowds at the Temple believed in him. "After all," they said, "would you expect the Messiah to do more miraculous signs than this man has done?"
43Jn 7:32 When the Pharisees heard that the crowds were whispering such things, they and the leading priests sent Temple guards to arrest Jesus.
43Jn 7:33 But Jesus told them, "I will be with you only a little longer. Then I will return to the one who sent me.
43Jn 7:34 You will search for me but not find me. And you cannot go where I am going."
43Jn 7:35 The Jewish leaders were puzzled by this statement. "Where is he planning to go?" they asked. "Is he thinking of leaving the country and going to the Jews in other lands?®Á Maybe he will even teach the Greeks! / ®ÁOr the Jews who live among the Greeks?
43Jn 7:36 What does he mean when he says, `You will search for me but not find me,' and `You cannot go where I am going'?"
43Jn 7:37 On the last day, the climax of the festival, Jesus stood and shouted to the crowds, "Anyone who is thirsty may come to me!
43Jn 7:38 Anyone who believes in me may come and drink! For the Scriptures declare, `Rivers of living water will flow from his heart.'"®Á / ®ÁOr "Let anyone who is thirsty come to me and drink. 38For the Scriptures declare, `Rivers of living water will flow from the heart of anyone who believes in me.'"
43Jn 7:39 (When he said "living water," he was speaking of the Spirit, who would be given to everyone believing in him. But the Spirit had not yet been given®Á, because Jesus had not yet entered into his glory.) / ®ÁSome manuscripts read But as yet there was no Spirit. Still others read But as yet there was no Holy Spirit
43Jn 7:40 When the crowds heard him say this, some of them declared, "Surely this man is the Prophet we've been expecting."®Á / ®ÁSee Deut 18.15, 18; Mal 4.5-6
43Jn 7:41 Others said, "He is the Messiah." Still others said, "But he can't be! Will the Messiah come from Galilee?
43Jn 7:42 For the Scriptures clearly state that the Messiah will be born of the royal line of David, in Bethlehem, the village where King David was born."®Á / ®ÁSee Mic 5.2
43Jn 7:43 So the crowd was divided about him.
43Jn 7:44 Some even wanted him arrested, but no one laid a hand on him.
43Jn 7:45 When the Temple guards returned without having arrested Jesus, the leading priests and Pharisees demanded, "Why didn't you bring him in?"
43Jn 7:46 "We have never heard anyone speak like this!" the guards responded.
43Jn 7:47 "Have you been led astray, too?" the Pharisees mocked.
43Jn 7:48 "Is there a single one of us rulers or Pharisees who believes in him?
43Jn 7:49 This foolish crowd follows him, but they are ignorant of the law. God's curse is on them!"
43Jn 7:50 Then Nicodemus, the leader who had met with Jesus earlier, spoke up.
43Jn 7:51 "Is it legal to convict a man before he is given a hearing?" he asked.
43Jn 7:52 They replied, "Are you from Galilee, too? Search the Scriptures and see for yourself?no prophet ever comes®Á from Galilee!" / ®ÁSome manuscripts read the prophet does not come
43Jn 7:53 [The most ancient Greek manuscripts do not include John 7.53-8.11.] Then the meeting broke up, and everybody went home.
43Jn 8:1 Jesus returned to the Mount of Olives,
43Jn 8:2 but early the next morning he was back again at the Temple. A crowd soon gathered, and he sat down and taught them.
43Jn 8:3 As he was speaking, the teachers of religious law and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in the act of adultery. They put her in front of the crowd.
43Jn 8:4 "Teacher," they said to Jesus, "this woman was caught in the act of adultery.
43Jn 8:5 The law of Moses says to stone her. What do you say?"
43Jn 8:6 They were trying to trap him into saying something they could use against him, but Jesus stooped down and wrote in the dust with his finger.
43Jn 8:7 They kept demanding an answer, so he stood up again and said, "All right, but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone!"
43Jn 8:8 Then he stooped down again and wrote in the dust.
43Jn 8:9 When the accusers heard this, they slipped away one by one, beginning with the oldest, until only Jesus was left in the middle of the crowd with the woman.
43Jn 8:10 Then Jesus stood up again and said to the woman, "Where are your accusers? Didn't even one of them condemn you?"
43Jn 8:11 "No, Lord," she said. And Jesus said, "Neither do I. Go and sin no more."
43Jn 8:12 Jesus spoke to the people once more and said, "I am the light of the world. If you follow me, you won't have to walk in darkness, because you will have the light that leads to life."
43Jn 8:13 The Pharisees replied, "You are making those claims about yourself! Such testimony is not valid."
43Jn 8:14 Jesus told them, "These claims are valid even though I make them about myself. For I know where I came from and where I am going, but you don't know this about me.
43Jn 8:15 You judge me by human standards, but I do not judge anyone.
43Jn 8:16 And if I did, my judgment would be correct in every respect because I am not alone. The Father®Á who sent me is with me. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read The One
43Jn 8:17 Your own law says that if two people agree about something, their witness is accepted as fact®Á. / ®ÁSee Deut 19.15
43Jn 8:18 I am one witness, and my Father who sent me is the other."
43Jn 8:19 "Where is your father?" they asked. Jesus answered, "Since you don't know who I am, you don't know who my Father is. If you knew me, you would also know my Father."
43Jn 8:20 Jesus made these statements while he was teaching in the section of the Temple known as the Treasury. But he was not arrested, because his time®Á had not yet come. / ®ÁGreek his hour
43Jn 8:21 Later Jesus said to them again, "I am going away. You will search for me but will die in your sin. You cannot come where I am going."
43Jn 8:22 The people®Á asked, "Is he planning to commit suicide? What does he mean, `You cannot come where I am going'?" / ®ÁGreek Jewish people; also in 8.31, 48, 52, 57
43Jn 8:23 Jesus continued, "You are from below; I am from above. You belong to this world; I do not.
43Jn 8:24 That is why I said that you will die in your sins; for unless you believe that I AM who I claim to be®Á, you will die in your sins." / ®ÁGreek unless you believe that I am. See Exod 3.14
43Jn 8:25 "Who are you?" they demanded. Jesus replied, "The one I have always claimed to be®Á. / ®ÁOr Why do I speak to you at all?
43Jn 8:26 I have much to say about you and much to condemn, but I won't. For I say only what I have heard from the one who sent me, and he is completely truthful."
43Jn 8:27 But they still didn't understand that he was talking about his Father.
43Jn 8:28 So Jesus said, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man on the cross, then you will understand that I AM he®Á. I do nothing on my own but say only what the Father taught me. / ®ÁGreek When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I am. "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
43Jn 8:29 And the one who sent me is with me?he has not deserted me. For I always do what pleases him."
43Jn 8:30 Then many who heard him say these things believed in him.
43Jn 8:31 Jesus said to the people who believed in him, "You are truly my disciples if you remain faithful to my teachings.
43Jn 8:32 And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
43Jn 8:33 "But we are descendants of Abraham," they said. "We have never been slaves to anyone. What do you mean, `You will be set free'?"
43Jn 8:34 Jesus replied, "I tell you the truth, everyone who sins is a slave of sin.
43Jn 8:35 A slave is not a permanent member of the family, but a son is part of the family forever.
43Jn 8:36 So if the Son sets you free, you are truly free.
43Jn 8:37 Yes, I realize that you are descendants of Abraham. And yet some of you are trying to kill me because there's no room in your hearts for my message.
43Jn 8:38 I am telling you what I saw when I was with my Father. But you are following the advice of your father."
43Jn 8:39 "Our father is Abraham!" they declared. "No," Jesus replied, "for if you were really the children of Abraham, you would follow his example®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read if you are really the children of Abraham, follow his example
43Jn 8:40 Instead, you are trying to kill me because I told you the truth, which I heard from God. Abraham never did such a thing.
43Jn 8:41 No, you are imitating your real father." They replied, "We aren't illegitimate children! God himself is our true Father."
43Jn 8:42 Jesus told them, "If God were your Father, you would love me, because I have come to you from God. I am not here on my own, but he sent me.
43Jn 8:43 Why can't you understand what I am saying? It's because you can't even hear me!
43Jn 8:44 For you are the children of your father the devil, and you love to do the evil things he does. He was a murderer from the beginning. He has always hated the truth, because there is no truth in him. When he lies, it is consistent with his character; for he is a liar and the father of lies.
43Jn 8:45 So when I tell the truth, you just naturally don't believe me!
43Jn 8:46 Which of you can truthfully accuse me of sin? And since I am telling you the truth, why don't you believe me?
43Jn 8:47 Anyone who belongs to God listens gladly to the words of God. But you don't listen because you don't belong to God."
43Jn 8:48 The people retorted, "You Samaritan devil! Didn't we say all along that you were possessed by a demon?"
43Jn 8:49 "No," Jesus said, "I have no demon in me. For I honor my Father?and you dishonor me.
43Jn 8:50 And though I have no wish to glorify myself, God is going to glorify me. He is the true judge.
43Jn 8:51 I tell you the truth, anyone who obeys my teaching will never die!"
43Jn 8:52 The people said, "Now we know you are possessed by a demon. Even Abraham and the prophets died, but you say, `Anyone who obeys my teaching will never die!'
43Jn 8:53 Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets. Who do you think you are?"
43Jn 8:54 Jesus answered, "If I want glory for myself, it doesn't count. But it is my Father who will glorify me. You say, `He is our God®Á,' / ®ÁSome manuscripts read your God
43Jn 8:55 but you don't even know him. I know him. If I said otherwise, I would be as great a liar as you! But I do know him and obey him.
43Jn 8:56 Your father Abraham rejoiced as he looked forward to my coming. He saw it and was glad."
43Jn 8:57 The people said, "You aren't even fifty years old. How can you say you have seen Abraham?®Á" / ®ÁSome manuscripts read How can you say Abraham has seen you?
43Jn 8:58 Jesus answered, "I tell you the truth, before Abraham was even born, I AM!®Á" / ®ÁOr before Abraham was even born, I have always been alive; Greek reads before Abraham was, I am. See Exod 3.14
43Jn 8:59 At that point they picked up stones to throw at him. But Jesus was hidden from them and left the Temple.
43Jn 9:1 As Jesus was walking along, he saw a man who had been blind from birth.
43Jn 9:2 "Rabbi," his disciples asked him, "why was this man born blind? Was it because of his own sins or his parents' sins?"
43Jn 9:3 "It was not because of his sins or his parents' sins," Jesus answered. "This happened so the power of God could be seen in him.
43Jn 9:4 We must quickly carry out the tasks assigned us by the one who sent us®Á. The night is coming, and then no one can work. / ®ÁOther manuscripts read I must quickly carry out the tasks assigned me by the one who sent me; still others read We must quickly carry out the tasks assigned us by the one who sent me
43Jn 9:5 But while I am here in the world, I am the light of the world."
43Jn 9:6 Then he spit on the ground, made mud with the saliva, and spread the mud over the blind man's eyes.
43Jn 9:7 He told him, "Go wash yourself in the pool of Siloam" ®Á. So the man went and washed and came back seeing! / ®ÁSiloam means "sent"
43Jn 9:8 His neighbors and others who knew him as a blind beggar asked each other, "Isn't this the man who used to sit and beg?"
43Jn 9:9 Some said he was, and others said, "No, he just looks like him!" But the beggar kept saying, "Yes, I am the same one!"
43Jn 9:10 They asked, "Who healed you? What happened?"
43Jn 9:11 He told them, "The man they call Jesus made mud and spread it over my eyes and told me, `Go to the pool of Siloam and wash yourself.' So I went and washed, and now I can see!"
43Jn 9:12 "Where is he now?" they asked. "I don't know," he replied.
43Jn 9:13 Then they took the man who had been blind to the Pharisees,
43Jn 9:14 because it was on the Sabbath that Jesus had made the mud and healed him.
43Jn 9:15 The Pharisees asked the man all about it. So he told them, "He put the mud over my eyes, and when I washed it away, I could see!"
43Jn 9:16 Some of the Pharisees said, "This man Jesus is not from God, for he is working on the Sabbath." Others said, "But how could an ordinary sinner do such miraculous signs?" So there was a deep division of opinion among them.
43Jn 9:17 Then the Pharisees again questioned the man who had been blind and demanded, "What's your opinion about this man who healed you?" The man replied, "I think he must be a prophet."
43Jn 9:18 The Jewish leaders still refused to believe the man had been blind and could now see, so they called in his parents.
43Jn 9:19 They asked them, "Is this your son? Was he born blind? If so, how can he now see?"
43Jn 9:20 His parents replied, "We know this is our son and that he was born blind,
43Jn 9:21 but we don't know how he can see or who healed him. Ask him. He is old enough to speak for himself."
43Jn 9:22 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders, who had announced that anyone saying Jesus was the Messiah would be expelled from the synagogue.
43Jn 9:23 That's why they said, "He is old enough. Ask him."
43Jn 9:24 So for the second time they called in the man who had been blind and told him, "God should get the glory for this®Á, because we know this man Jesus is a sinner." / ®ÁOr Give glory to God, not to Jesus; Greek reads Give glory to God
43Jn 9:25 "I don't know whether he is a sinner," the man replied. "But I know this£∫ I was blind, and now I can see!"
43Jn 9:26 "But what did he do?" they asked. "How did he heal you?"
43Jn 9:27 "Look!" the man exclaimed. "I told you once. Didn't you listen? Why do you want to hear it again? Do you want to become his disciples, too?"
43Jn 9:28 Then they cursed him and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses!
43Jn 9:29 We know God spoke to Moses, but we don't even know where this man comes from."
43Jn 9:30 "Why, that's very strange!" the man replied. "He healed my eyes, and yet you don't know where he comes from?
43Jn 9:31 We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but he is ready to hear those who worship him and do his will.
43Jn 9:32 Ever since the world began, no one has been able to open the eyes of someone born blind.
43Jn 9:33 If this man were not from God, he couldn't have done it."
43Jn 9:34 "You were born a total sinner!" they answered. "Are you trying to teach us?" And they threw him out of the synagogue.
43Jn 9:35 When Jesus heard what had happened, he found the man and asked, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?®Á" / ®ÁSome manuscripts read the Son of God? "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
43Jn 9:36 The man answered, "Who is he, sir? I want to believe in him."
43Jn 9:37 "You have seen him," Jesus said, "and he is speaking to you!"
43Jn 9:38 "Yes, Lord, I believe!" the man said. And he worshiped Jesus.
43Jn 9:39 Then Jesus told him®Á, "I entered this world to render judgment?to give sight to the blind and to show those who think they see®Ë that they are blind." / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include "Yes, Lord, I believe!" the man said. And he worshiped Jesus. Then Jesus told him ®ËGreek those who see
43Jn 9:40 Some Pharisees who were standing nearby heard him and asked, "Are you saying we're blind?"
43Jn 9:41 "If you were blind, you wouldn't be guilty," Jesus replied. "But you remain guilty because you claim you can see.
43Jn 10:1 "I tell you the truth, anyone who sneaks over the wall of a sheepfold, rather than going through the gate, must surely be a thief and a robber!
43Jn 10:2 But the one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
43Jn 10:3 The gatekeeper opens the gate for him, and the sheep recognize his voice and come to him. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
43Jn 10:4 After he has gathered his own flock, he walks ahead of them, and they follow him because they know his voice.
43Jn 10:5 They won't follow a stranger; they will run from him because they don't know his voice."
43Jn 10:6 Those who heard Jesus use this illustration didn't understand what he meant,
43Jn 10:7 so he explained it to them£∫ "I tell you the truth, I am the gate for the sheep.
43Jn 10:8 All who came before me®Á were thieves and robbers. But the true sheep did not listen to them. / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include before me
43Jn 10:9 Yes, I am the gate. Those who come in through me will be saved®Á. They will come and go freely and will find good pastures. / ®ÁOr will find safety
43Jn 10:10 The thief's purpose is to steal and kill and destroy. My purpose is to give them a rich and satisfying life.
43Jn 10:11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd sacrifices his life for the sheep.
43Jn 10:12 A hired hand will run when he sees a wolf coming. He will abandon the sheep because they don't belong to him and he isn't their shepherd. And so the wolf attacks them and scatters the flock.
43Jn 10:13 The hired hand runs away because he's working only for the money and doesn't really care about the sheep.
43Jn 10:14 "I am the good shepherd; I know my own sheep, and they know me,
43Jn 10:15 just as my Father knows me and I know the Father. So I sacrifice my life for the sheep.
43Jn 10:16 I have other sheep, too, that are not in this sheepfold. I must bring them also. They will listen to my voice, and there will be one flock with one shepherd.
43Jn 10:17 "The Father loves me because I sacrifice my life so I may take it back again.
43Jn 10:18 No one can take my life from me. I sacrifice it voluntarily. For I have the authority to lay it down when I want to and also to take it up again. For this is what my Father has commanded."
43Jn 10:19 When he said these things, the people®Á were again divided in their opinions about him. / ®ÁGreek Jewish people; also in 10.24, 31
43Jn 10:20 Some said, "He's demon possessed and out of his mind. Why listen to a man like that?"
43Jn 10:21 Others said, "This doesn't sound like a man possessed by a demon! Can a demon open the eyes of the blind?"
43Jn 10:22 It was now winter, and Jesus was in Jerusalem at the time of Hanukkah, the Festival of Dedication.
43Jn 10:23 He was in the Temple, walking through the section known as Solomon's Colonnade.
43Jn 10:24 The people surrounded him and asked, "How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us plainly."
43Jn 10:25 Jesus replied, "I have already told you, and you don't believe me. The proof is the work I do in my Father's name.
43Jn 10:26 But you don't believe me because you are not my sheep.
43Jn 10:27 My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me.
43Jn 10:28 I give them eternal life, and they will never perish. No one can snatch them away from me,
43Jn 10:29 for my Father has given them to me, and he is more powerful than anyone else®Á. No one can snatch them from the Father's hand. / ®ÁOther manuscripts read for what my Father has given me is more powerful than anything; still others read for regarding that which my Father has given me, he is greater than all
43Jn 10:30 The Father and I are one."
43Jn 10:31 Once again the people picked up stones to kill him.
43Jn 10:32 Jesus said, "At my Father's direction I have done many good works. For which one are you going to stone me?"
43Jn 10:33 They replied, "We're stoning you not for any good work, but for blasphemy! You, a mere man, claim to be God."
43Jn 10:34 Jesus replied, "It is written in your own Scriptures®Á that God said to certain leaders of the people, `I say, you are gods!'®Ë / ®ÁGreek your own law ®ËPs 82.6
43Jn 10:35 And you know that the Scriptures cannot be altered. So if those people who received God's message were called `gods,'
43Jn 10:36 why do you call it blasphemy when I say, `I am the Son of God'? After all, the Father set me apart and sent me into the world.
43Jn 10:37 Don't believe me unless I carry out my Father's work.
43Jn 10:38 But if I do his work, believe in the evidence of the miraculous works I have done, even if you don't believe me. Then you will know and understand that the Father is in me, and I am in the Father."
43Jn 10:39 Once again they tried to arrest him, but he got away and left them.
43Jn 10:40 He went beyond the Jordan River near the place where John was first baptizing and stayed there awhile.
43Jn 10:41 And many followed him. "John didn't perform miraculous signs," they remarked to one another, "but everything he said about this man has come true."
43Jn 10:42 And many who were there believed in Jesus.
43Jn 11:1 A man named Lazarus was sick. He lived in Bethany with his sisters, Mary and Martha.
43Jn 11:2 This is the Mary who later poured the expensive perfume on the Lord's feet and wiped them with her hair®Á. Her brother, Lazarus, was sick. / ®ÁThis incident is recorded in chapter 12
43Jn 11:3 So the two sisters sent a message to Jesus telling him, "Lord, your dear friend is very sick."
43Jn 11:4 But when Jesus heard about it he said, "Lazarus's sickness will not end in death. No, it happened for the glory of God so that the Son of God will receive glory from this."
43Jn 11:5 So although Jesus loved Martha, Mary, and Lazarus,
43Jn 11:6 he stayed where he was for the next two days.
43Jn 11:7 Finally, he said to his disciples, "Let's go back to Judea."
43Jn 11:8 But his disciples objected. "Rabbi," they said, "only a few days ago the people®Á in Judea were trying to stone you. Are you going there again?" / ®ÁGreek Jewish people; also in 11.19, 31, 33, 36, 45, 54
43Jn 11:9 Jesus replied, "There are twelve hours of daylight every day. During the day people can walk safely. They can see because they have the light of this world.
43Jn 11:10 But at night there is danger of stumbling because they have no light."
43Jn 11:11 Then he said, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but now I will go and wake him up."
43Jn 11:12 The disciples said, "Lord, if he is sleeping, he will soon get better!"
43Jn 11:13 They thought Jesus meant Lazarus was simply sleeping, but Jesus meant Lazarus had died.
43Jn 11:14 So he told them plainly, "Lazarus is dead.
43Jn 11:15 And for your sakes, I'm glad I wasn't there, for now you will really believe. Come, let's go see him."
43Jn 11:16 Thomas, nicknamed the Twin®Á, said to his fellow disciples, "Let's go, too?and die with Jesus." / ®ÁGreek Thomas, who was called Didymus
43Jn 11:17 When Jesus arrived at Bethany, he was told that Lazarus had already been in his grave for four days.
43Jn 11:18 Bethany was only a few miles®Á down the road from Jerusalem, / ®ÁGreek was about 15 stadia [about 2.8 kilometers]
43Jn 11:19 and many of the people had come to console Martha and Mary in their loss.
43Jn 11:20 When Martha got word that Jesus was coming, she went to meet him. But Mary stayed in the house.
43Jn 11:21 Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died.
43Jn 11:22 But even now I know that God will give you whatever you ask."
43Jn 11:23 Jesus told her, "Your brother will rise again."
43Jn 11:24 "Yes," Martha said, "he will rise when everyone else rises, at the last day."
43Jn 11:25 Jesus told her, "I am the resurrection and the life®Á. Anyone who believes in me will live, even after dying. / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include and the life
43Jn 11:26 Everyone who lives in me and believes in me will never ever die. Do you believe this, Martha?"
43Jn 11:27 "Yes, Lord," she told him. "I have always believed you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who has come into the world from God."
43Jn 11:28 Then she returned to Mary. She called Mary aside from the mourners and told her, "The Teacher is here and wants to see you."
43Jn 11:29 So Mary immediately went to him.
43Jn 11:30 Jesus had stayed outside the village, at the place where Martha met him.
43Jn 11:31 When the people who were at the house consoling Mary saw her leave so hastily, they assumed she was going to Lazarus's grave to weep. So they followed her there.
43Jn 11:32 When Mary arrived and saw Jesus, she fell at his feet and said, "Lord, if only you had been here, my brother would not have died."
43Jn 11:33 When Jesus saw her weeping and saw the other people wailing with her, a deep anger welled up within him®Á, and he was deeply troubled. / ®ÁOr he was angry in his spirit
43Jn 11:34 "Where have you put him?" he asked them. They told him, "Lord, come and see."
43Jn 11:35 Then Jesus wept.
43Jn 11:36 The people who were standing nearby said, "See how much he loved him!"
43Jn 11:37 But some said, "This man healed a blind man. Couldn't he have kept Lazarus from dying?"
43Jn 11:38 Jesus was still angry as he arrived at the tomb, a cave with a stone rolled across its entrance.
43Jn 11:39 "Roll the stone aside," Jesus told them. But Martha, the dead man's sister, protested, "Lord, he has been dead for four days. The smell will be terrible."
43Jn 11:40 Jesus responded, "Didn't I tell you that you would see God's glory if you believe?"
43Jn 11:41 So they rolled the stone aside. Then Jesus looked up to heaven and said, "Father, thank you for hearing me.
43Jn 11:42 You always hear me, but I said it out loud for the sake of all these people standing here, so that they will believe you sent me."
43Jn 11:43 Then Jesus shouted, "Lazarus, come out!"
43Jn 11:44 And the dead man came out, his hands and feet bound in graveclothes, his face wrapped in a headcloth. Jesus told them, "Unwrap him and let him go!"
43Jn 11:45 Many of the people who were with Mary believed in Jesus when they saw this happen.
43Jn 11:46 But some went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
43Jn 11:47 Then the leading priests and Pharisees called the high council®Á together. "What are we going to do?" they asked each other. "This man certainly performs many miraculous signs. / ®ÁGreek the Sanhedrin
43Jn 11:48 If we allow him to go on like this, soon everyone will believe in him. Then the Roman army will come and destroy both our Temple®Á and our nation." / ®ÁOr our position; Greek reads our place
43Jn 11:49 Caiaphas, who was high priest at that time®Á, said, "You don't know what you're talking about! / ®ÁGreek that year; also in 11.51
43Jn 11:50 You don't realize that it's better for you that one man should die for the people than for the whole nation to be destroyed."
43Jn 11:51 He did not say this on his own; as high priest at that time he was led to prophesy that Jesus would die for the entire nation.
43Jn 11:52 And not only for that nation, but to bring together and unite all the children of God scattered around the world.
43Jn 11:53 So from that time on, the Jewish leaders began to plot Jesus' death.
43Jn 11:54 As a result, Jesus stopped his public ministry among the people and left Jerusalem. He went to a place near the wilderness, to the village of Ephraim, and stayed there with his disciples.
43Jn 11:55 It was now almost time for the Jewish Passover celebration, and many people from all over the country arrived in Jerusalem several days early so they could go through the purification ceremony before Passover began.
43Jn 11:56 They kept looking for Jesus, but as they stood around in the Temple, they said to each other, "What do you think? He won't come for Passover, will he?"
43Jn 11:57 Meanwhile, the leading priests and Pharisees had publicly ordered that anyone seeing Jesus must report it immediately so they could arrest him.
43Jn 12:1 Six days before the Passover celebration began, Jesus arrived in Bethany, the home of Lazarus?the man he had raised from the dead.
43Jn 12:2 A dinner was prepared in Jesus' honor. Martha served, and Lazarus was among those who ate®Á with him. / ®ÁOr who reclined
43Jn 12:3 Then Mary took a twelve-ounce jar®Á of expensive perfume made from essence of nard, and she anointed Jesus' feet with it, wiping his feet with her hair. The house was filled with the fragrance. / ®ÁGreek took 1 litra [327 grams]
43Jn 12:4 But Judas Iscariot, the disciple who would soon betray him, said,
43Jn 12:5 "That perfume was worth a year's wages®Á. It should have been sold and the money given to the poor." / ®ÁGreek worth 300 denarii. A denarius was equivalent to a laborer's full day's wage
43Jn 12:6 Not that he cared for the poor?he was a thief, and since he was in charge of the disciples' money, he often stole some for himself.
43Jn 12:7 Jesus replied, "Leave her alone. She did this in preparation for my burial.
43Jn 12:8 You will always have the poor among you, but you will not always have me."
43Jn 12:9 When all the people®Á heard of Jesus' arrival, they flocked to see him and also to see Lazarus, the man Jesus had raised from the dead. / ®ÁGreek Jewish people; also in 12.11
43Jn 12:10 Then the leading priests decided to kill Lazarus, too,
43Jn 12:11 for it was because of him that many of the people had deserted them®Á and believed in Jesus. / ®ÁOr had deserted their traditions; Greek reads had deserted
43Jn 12:12 The next day, the news that Jesus was on the way to Jerusalem swept through the city. A large crowd of Passover visitors
43Jn 12:13 took palm branches and went down the road to meet him. They shouted, "Praise God!®Á Blessings on the one who comes in the name of the LORD! Hail to the King of Israel!"®Ë / ®ÁGreek Hosanna, an exclamation of praise adapted from a Hebrew expression that means "save now." ®ËPs 118.25-26; Zeph 3.15
43Jn 12:14 Jesus found a young donkey and rode on it, fulfilling the prophecy that said.
43Jn 12:15 "Don't be afraid, people of Jerusalem®Á. Look, your King is coming, riding on a donkey's colt."®Ë / ®ÁGreek daughter of Zion ®ËZech 9.9
43Jn 12:16 His disciples didn't understand at the time that this was a fulfillment of prophecy. But after Jesus entered into his glory, they remembered what had happened and realized that these things had been written about him.
43Jn 12:17 Many in the crowd had seen Jesus call Lazarus from the tomb, raising him from the dead, and they were telling others®Á about it. / ®ÁGreek were testifying
43Jn 12:18 That was the reason so many went out to meet him?because they had heard about this miraculous sign.
43Jn 12:19 Then the Pharisees said to each other, "There's nothing we can do. Look, everyone®Á has gone after him!" / ®ÁGreek the world
43Jn 12:20 Some Greeks who had come to Jerusalem for the Passover celebration
43Jn 12:21 paid a visit to Philip, who was from Bethsaida in Galilee. They said, "Sir, we want to meet Jesus."
43Jn 12:22 Philip told Andrew about it, and they went together to ask Jesus.
43Jn 12:23 Jesus replied, "Now the time has come for the Son of Man®Á to enter into his glory. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
43Jn 12:24 I tell you the truth, unless a kernel of wheat is planted in the soil and dies, it remains alone. But its death will produce many new kernels?a plentiful harvest of new lives.
43Jn 12:25 Those who love their life in this world will lose it. Those who care nothing for their life in this world will keep it for eternity.
43Jn 12:26 Anyone who wants to be my disciple must follow me, because my servants must be where I am. And the Father will honor anyone who serves me.
43Jn 12:27 "Now my soul is deeply troubled. Should I pray, `Father, save me from this hour'? But this is the very reason I came!
43Jn 12:28 Father, bring glory to your name." Then a voice spoke from heaven, saying, "I have already brought glory to my name, and I will do so again."
43Jn 12:29 When the crowd heard the voice, some thought it was thunder, while others declared an angel had spoken to him.
43Jn 12:30 Then Jesus told them, "The voice was for your benefit, not mine.
43Jn 12:31 The time for judging this world has come, when Satan, the ruler of this world, will be cast out.
43Jn 12:32 And when I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw everyone to myself."
43Jn 12:33 He said this to indicate how he was going to die.
43Jn 12:34 The crowd responded, "We understood from Scripture®Á that the Messiah would live forever. How can you say the Son of Man will die? Just who is this Son of Man, anyway?" / ®ÁGreek from the law
43Jn 12:35 Jesus replied, "My light will shine for you just a little longer. Walk in the light while you can, so the darkness will not overtake you. Those who walk in the darkness cannot see where they are going.
43Jn 12:36 Put your trust in the light while there is still time; then you will become children of the light." After saying these things, Jesus went away and was hidden from them.
43Jn 12:37 But despite all the miraculous signs Jesus had done, most of the people still did not believe in him.
43Jn 12:38 This is exactly what Isaiah the prophet had predicted£∫ "LORD, who has believed our message? To whom has the LORD revealed his powerful arm?"®Á / ®ÁIsa 53.1
43Jn 12:39 But the people couldn't believe, for as Isaiah also said,
43Jn 12:40 "The Lord has blinded their eyes and hardened their hearts? so that their eyes cannot see, and their hearts cannot understand, and they cannot turn to me and have me heal them."®Á / ®ÁIsa 6.10
43Jn 12:41 Isaiah was referring to Jesus when he said this, because he saw the future and spoke of the Messiah's glory.
43Jn 12:42 Many people did believe in him, however, including some of the Jewish leaders. But they wouldn't admit it for fear that the Pharisees would expel them from the synagogue.
43Jn 12:43 For they loved human praise more than the praise of God.
43Jn 12:44 Jesus shouted to the crowds, "If you trust me, you are trusting not only me, but also God who sent me.
43Jn 12:45 For when you see me, you are seeing the one who sent me.
43Jn 12:46 I have come as a light to shine in this dark world, so that all who put their trust in me will no longer remain in the dark.
43Jn 12:47 I will not judge those who hear me but don't obey me, for I have come to save the world and not to judge it.
43Jn 12:48 But all who reject me and my message will be judged on the day of judgment by the truth I have spoken.
43Jn 12:49 I don't speak on my own authority. The Father who sent me has commanded me what to say and how to say it.
43Jn 12:50 And I know his commands lead to eternal life; so I say whatever the Father tells me to say."
43Jn 13:1 Before the Passover celebration, Jesus knew that his hour had come to leave this world and return to his Father. He had loved his disciples during his ministry on earth, and now he loved them to the very end®Á. / ®ÁOr he showed them the full extent of his love
43Jn 13:2 It was time for supper, and the devil had already prompted Judas®Á, son of Simon Iscariot, to betray Jesus. / ®ÁOr the devil had already intended for Judas
43Jn 13:3 Jesus knew that the Father had given him authority over everything and that he had come from God and would return to God.
43Jn 13:4 So he got up from the table, took off his robe, wrapped a towel around his waist,
43Jn 13:5 and poured water into a basin. Then he began to wash the disciples' feet, drying them with the towel he had around him.
43Jn 13:6 When Jesus came to Simon Peter, Peter said to him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?"
43Jn 13:7 Jesus replied, "You don't understand now what I am doing, but someday you will."
43Jn 13:8 "No," Peter protested, "you will never ever wash my feet!" Jesus replied, "Unless I wash you, you won't belong to me."
43Jn 13:9 Simon Peter exclaimed, "Then wash my hands and head as well, Lord, not just my feet!"
43Jn 13:10 Jesus replied, "A person who has bathed all over does not need to wash, except for the feet®Á, to be entirely clean. And you disciples are clean, but not all of you." / ®ÁSome manuscripts do not include except for the feet
43Jn 13:11 For Jesus knew who would betray him. That is what he meant when he said, "Not all of you are clean."
43Jn 13:12 After washing their feet, he put on his robe again and sat down and asked, "Do you understand what I was doing?
43Jn 13:13 You call me `Teacher' and `Lord,' and you are right, because that's what I am.
43Jn 13:14 And since I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you ought to wash each other's feet.
43Jn 13:15 I have given you an example to follow. Do as I have done to you.
43Jn 13:16 I tell you the truth, slaves are not greater than their master. Nor is the messenger more important than the one who sends the message.
43Jn 13:17 Now that you know these things, God will bless you for doing them.
43Jn 13:18 "I am not saying these things to all of you; I know the ones I have chosen. But this fulfills the Scripture that says, `The one who eats my food has turned against me.'®Á / ®ÁPs 41.9
43Jn 13:19 I tell you this beforehand, so that when it happens you will believe that I AM the Messiah®Á. / ®ÁOr that the `I AM' has come; or that I am the LORD; Greek reads that I am. See Exod 3.14
43Jn 13:20 I tell you the truth, anyone who welcomes my messenger is welcoming me, and anyone who welcomes me is welcoming the Father who sent me."
43Jn 13:21 Now Jesus was deeply troubled®Á, and he exclaimed, "I tell you the truth, one of you will betray me!" / ®ÁGreek was troubled in his spirit
43Jn 13:22 The disciples looked at each other, wondering whom he could mean.
43Jn 13:23 The disciple Jesus loved was sitting next to Jesus at the table®Á. / ®ÁGreek was reclining on Jesus' bosom. The "disciple Jesus loved" was probably John
43Jn 13:24 Simon Peter motioned to him to ask, "Who's he talking about?"
43Jn 13:25 So that disciple leaned over to Jesus and asked, "Lord, who is it?"
43Jn 13:26 Jesus responded, "It is the one to whom I give the bread I dip in the bowl." And when he had dipped it, he gave it to Judas, son of Simon Iscariot.
43Jn 13:27 When Judas had eaten the bread, Satan entered into him. Then Jesus told him, "Hurry and do what you're going to do."
43Jn 13:28 None of the others at the table knew what Jesus meant.
43Jn 13:29 Since Judas was their treasurer, some thought Jesus was telling him to go and pay for the food or to give some money to the poor.
43Jn 13:30 So Judas left at once, going out into the night.
43Jn 13:31 As soon as Judas left the room, Jesus said, "The time has come for the Son of Man®Á to enter into his glory, and God will be glorified because of him. / ®Á"Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
43Jn 13:32 And since God receives glory because of the Son®Á, he will soon give glory to the Son. / ®ÁSome manuscripts omit And since God receives glory because of the Son
43Jn 13:33 Dear children, I will be with you only a little longer. And as I told the Jewish leaders, you will search for me, but you can't come where I am going.
43Jn 13:34 So now I am giving you a new commandment£∫ Love each other. Just as I have loved you, you should love each other.
43Jn 13:35 Your love for one another will prove to the world that you are my disciples."
43Jn 13:36 Simon Peter asked, "Lord, where are you going?" And Jesus replied, "You can't go with me now, but you will follow me later."
43Jn 13:37 "But why can't I come now, Lord?" he asked. "I'm ready to die for you."
43Jn 13:38 Jesus answered, "Die for me? I tell you the truth, Peter?before the rooster crows tomorrow morning, you will deny three times that you even know me.
43Jn 14:1 "Don't let your hearts be troubled. Trust in God, and trust also in me.
43Jn 14:2 There is more than enough room in my Father's home®Á. If this were not so, would I have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you?®Ë / ®ÁOr There are many rooms in my Father's house ®ËOr If this were not so, I would have told you that I am going to prepare a place for you. Some manuscripts read If this were not so, I would have told you. I am going to prepare a place for you
43Jn 14:3 When everything is ready, I will come and get you, so that you will always be with me where I am.
43Jn 14:4 And you know the way to where I am going."
43Jn 14:5 "No, we don't know, Lord," Thomas said. "We have no idea where you are going, so how can we know the way?"
43Jn 14:6 Jesus told him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one can come to the Father except through me.
43Jn 14:7 If you had really known me, you would know who my Father is®Á. From now on, you do know him and have seen him!" / ®ÁSome manuscripts read If you have really known me, you will know who my Father is
43Jn 14:8 Philip said, "Lord, show us the Father, and we will be satisfied."
43Jn 14:9 Jesus replied, "Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and yet you still don't know who I am? Anyone who has seen me has seen the Father! So why are you asking me to show him to you?
43Jn 14:10 Don't you believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words I speak are not my own, but my Father who lives in me does his work through me.
43Jn 14:11 Just believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Or at least believe because of the work you have seen me do.
43Jn 14:12 "I tell you the truth, anyone who believes in me will do the same works I have done, and even greater works, because I am going to be with the Father.
43Jn 14:13 You can ask for anything in my name, and I will do it, so that the Son can bring glory to the Father.
43Jn 14:14 Yes, ask me for anything in my name, and I will do it!
43Jn 14:15 "If you love me, obey®Á my commandments. / ®ÁOther manuscripts read you will obey; still others read you should obey
43Jn 14:16 And I will ask the Father, and he will give you another Advocate®Á, who will never leave you. / ®ÁOr Comforter, or Encourager, or Counselor. Greek reads Paraclete; also in 14.26
43Jn 14:17 He is the Holy Spirit, who leads into all truth. The world cannot receive him, because it isn't looking for him and doesn't recognize him. But you know him, because he lives with you now and later will be in you®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read and is in you
43Jn 14:18 No, I will not abandon you as orphans?I will come to you.
43Jn 14:19 Soon the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Since I live, you also will live.
43Jn 14:20 When I am raised to life again, you will know that I am in my Father, and you are in me, and I am in you.
43Jn 14:21 Those who accept my commandments and obey them are the ones who love me. And because they love me, my Father will love them. And I will love them and reveal myself to each of them."
43Jn 14:22 Judas (not Judas Iscariot, but the other disciple with that name) said to him, "Lord, why are you going to reveal yourself only to us and not to the world at large?"
43Jn 14:23 Jesus replied, "All who love me will do what I say. My Father will love them, and we will come and make our home with each of them.
43Jn 14:24 Anyone who doesn't love me will not obey me. And remember, my words are not my own. What I am telling you is from the Father who sent me.
43Jn 14:25 I am telling you these things now while I am still with you.
43Jn 14:26 But when the Father sends the Advocate as my representative?that is, the Holy Spirit?he will teach you everything and will remind you of everything I have told you.
43Jn 14:27 "I am leaving you with a gift?peace of mind and heart. And the peace I give is a gift the world cannot give. So don't be troubled or afraid.
43Jn 14:28 Remember what I told you£∫ I am going away, but I will come back to you again. If you really loved me, you would be happy that I am going to the Father, who is greater than I am.
43Jn 14:29 I have told you these things before they happen so that when they do happen, you will believe.
43Jn 14:30 "I don't have much more time to talk to you, because the ruler of this world approaches. He has no power over me,
43Jn 14:31 but I will do what the Father requires of me, so that the world will know that I love the Father. Come, let's be going.
43Jn 15:1 "I am the true grapevine, and my Father is the gardener.
43Jn 15:2 He cuts off every branch of mine that doesn't produce fruit, and he prunes the branches that do bear fruit so they will produce even more.
43Jn 15:3 You have already been pruned and purified by the message I have given you.
43Jn 15:4 Remain in me, and I will remain in you. For a branch cannot produce fruit if it is severed from the vine, and you cannot be fruitful unless you remain in me.
43Jn 15:5 "Yes, I am the vine; you are the branches. Those who remain in me, and I in them, will produce much fruit. For apart from me you can do nothing.
43Jn 15:6 Anyone who does not remain in me is thrown away like a useless branch and withers. Such branches are gathered into a pile to be burned.
43Jn 15:7 But if you remain in me and my words remain in you, you may ask for anything you want, and it will be granted!
43Jn 15:8 When you produce much fruit, you are my true disciples. This brings great glory to my Father.
43Jn 15:9 "I have loved you even as the Father has loved me. Remain in my love.
43Jn 15:10 When you obey my commandments, you remain in my love, just as I obey my Father's commandments and remain in his love.
43Jn 15:11 I have told you these things so that you will be filled with my joy. Yes, your joy will overflow!
43Jn 15:12 This is my commandment£∫ Love each other in the same way I have loved you.
43Jn 15:13 There is no greater love than to lay down one's life for one's friends.
43Jn 15:14 You are my friends if you do what I command.
43Jn 15:15 I no longer call you slaves, because a master doesn't confide in his slaves. Now you are my friends, since I have told you everything the Father told me.
43Jn 15:16 You didn't choose me. I chose you. I appointed you to go and produce lasting fruit, so that the Father will give you whatever you ask for, using my name.
43Jn 15:17 This is my command£∫ Love each other.
43Jn 15:18 "If the world hates you, remember that it hated me first.
43Jn 15:19 The world would love you as one of its own if you belonged to it, but you are no longer part of the world. I chose you to come out of the world, so it hates you.
43Jn 15:20 Do you remember what I told you? `A slave is not greater than the master.' Since they persecuted me, naturally they will persecute you. And if they had listened to me, they would listen to you.
43Jn 15:21 They will do all this to you because of me, for they have rejected the One who sent me.
43Jn 15:22 They would not be guilty if I had not come and spoken to them. But now they have no excuse for their sin.
43Jn 15:23 Anyone who hates me also hates my Father.
43Jn 15:24 If I hadn't done such miraculous signs among them that no one else could do, they would not be guilty. But as it is, they have seen everything I did, yet they still hate me and my Father.
43Jn 15:25 This fulfills what is written in their Scriptures®Á£∫ `They hated me without cause.' / ®ÁGreek in their law. Pss 35.19; 69.4
43Jn 15:26 "But I will send you the Advocate®Á - the Spirit of truth. He will come to you from the Father and will testify all about me. / ®ÁOr Comforter, or Encourager, or Counselor. Greek reads Paraclete
43Jn 15:27 And you must also testify about me because you have been with me from the beginning of my ministry.
43Jn 16:1 "I have told you these things so that you won't abandon your faith.
43Jn 16:2 For you will be expelled from the synagogues, and the time is coming when those who kill you will think they are doing a holy service for God.
43Jn 16:3 This is because they have never known the Father or me.
43Jn 16:4 Yes, I'm telling you these things now, so that when they happen, you will remember my warning. I didn't tell you earlier because I was going to be with you for a while longer.
43Jn 16:5 "But now I am going away to the One who sent me, and not one of you is asking where I am going.
43Jn 16:6 Instead, you grieve because of what I've told you.
43Jn 16:7 But in fact, it is best for you that I go away, because if I don't, the Advocate®Á won't come. If I do go away, then I will send him to you. / ®ÁOr Comforter, or Encourager, or Counselor. Greek reads Paraclete
43Jn 16:8 And when he comes, he will convict the world of its sin, and of God's righteousness, and of the coming judgment.
43Jn 16:9 The world's sin is that it refuses to believe in me.
43Jn 16:10 Righteousness is available because I go to the Father, and you will see me no more.
43Jn 16:11 Judgment will come because the ruler of this world has already been judged.
43Jn 16:12 "There is so much more I want to tell you, but you can't bear it now.
43Jn 16:13 When the Spirit of truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own but will tell you what he has heard. He will tell you about the future.
43Jn 16:14 He will bring me glory by telling you whatever he receives from me.
43Jn 16:15 All that belongs to the Father is mine; this is why I said, `The Spirit will tell you whatever he receives from me.'
43Jn 16:16 "In a little while you won't see me anymore. But a little while after that, you will see me again."
43Jn 16:17 Some of the disciples asked each other, "What does he mean when he says, `In a little while you won't see me, but then you will see me,' and `I am going to the Father'?
43Jn 16:18 And what does he mean by `a little while'? We don't understand."
43Jn 16:19 Jesus realized they wanted to ask him about it, so he said, "Are you asking yourselves what I meant? I said in a little while you won't see me, but a little while after that you will see me again.
43Jn 16:20 I tell you the truth, you will weep and mourn over what is going to happen to me, but the world will rejoice. You will grieve, but your grief will suddenly turn to wonderful joy.
43Jn 16:21 It will be like a woman suffering the pains of labor. When her child is born, her anguish gives way to joy because she has brought a new baby into the world.
43Jn 16:22 So you have sorrow now, but I will see you again; then you will rejoice, and no one can rob you of that joy.
43Jn 16:23 At that time you won't need to ask me for anything. I tell you the truth, you will ask the Father directly, and he will grant your request because you use my name.
43Jn 16:24 You haven't done this before. Ask, using my name, and you will receive, and you will have abundant joy.
43Jn 16:25 "I have spoken of these matters in figures of speech, but soon I will stop speaking figuratively and will tell you plainly all about the Father.
43Jn 16:26 Then you will ask in my name. I'm not saying I will ask the Father on your behalf,
43Jn 16:27 for the Father himself loves you dearly because you love me and believe that I came from God®Á. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read from the Father
43Jn 16:28 Yes, I came from the Father into the world, and now I will leave the world and return to the Father."
43Jn 16:29 Then his disciples said, "At last you are speaking plainly and not figuratively.
43Jn 16:30 Now we understand that you know everything, and there's no need to question you. From this we believe that you came from God."
43Jn 16:31 Jesus asked, "Do you finally believe?
43Jn 16:32 But the time is coming?indeed it's here now?when you will be scattered, each one going his own way, leaving me alone. Yet I am not alone because the Father is with me.
43Jn 16:33 I have told you all this so that you may have peace in me. Here on earth you will have many trials and sorrows. But take heart, because I have overcome the world."
43Jn 17:1 After saying all these things, Jesus looked up to heaven and said, "Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son so he can give glory back to you.
43Jn 17:2 For you have given him authority over everyone. He gives eternal life to each one you have given him.
43Jn 17:3 And this is the way to have eternal life?to know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ, the one you sent to earth.
43Jn 17:4 I brought glory to you here on earth by completing the work you gave me to do.
43Jn 17:5 Now, Father, bring me into the glory we shared before the world began.
43Jn 17:6 "I have revealed you®Á to the ones you gave me from this world. They were always yours. You gave them to me, and they have kept your word. / ®ÁGreek have revealed your name; also in 17.26
43Jn 17:7 Now they know that everything I have is a gift from you,
43Jn 17:8 for I have passed on to them the message you gave me. They accepted it and know that I came from you, and they believe you sent me.
43Jn 17:9 "My prayer is not for the world, but for those you have given me, because they belong to you.
43Jn 17:10 All who are mine belong to you, and you have given them to me, so they bring me glory.
43Jn 17:11 Now I am departing from the world; they are staying in this world, but I am coming to you. Holy Father, you have given me your name®Á; now protect them by the power of your name so that they will be united just as we are. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read you have given me these [disciples]
43Jn 17:12 During my time here, I protected them by the power of the name you gave me®Á. I guarded them so that not one was lost, except the one headed for destruction, as the Scriptures foretold. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read I protected those you gave me, by the power of your name
43Jn 17:13 "Now I am coming to you. I told them many things while I was with them in this world so they would be filled with my joy.
43Jn 17:14 I have given them your word. And the world hates them because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.
43Jn 17:15 I'm not asking you to take them out of the world, but to keep them safe from the evil one.
43Jn 17:16 They do not belong to this world any more than I do.
43Jn 17:17 Make them holy by your truth; teach them your word, which is truth.
43Jn 17:18 Just as you sent me into the world, I am sending them into the world.
43Jn 17:19 And I give myself as a holy sacrifice for them so they can be made holy by your truth.
43Jn 17:20 "I am praying not only for these disciples but also for all who will ever believe in me through their message.
43Jn 17:21 I pray that they will all be one, just as you and I are one?as you are in me, Father, and I am in you. And may they be in us so that the world will believe you sent me.
43Jn 17:22 "I have given them the glory you gave me, so they may be one as we are one.
43Jn 17:23 I am in them and you are in me. May they experience such perfect unity that the world will know that you sent me and that you love them as much as you love me.
43Jn 17:24 Father, I want these whom you have given me to be with me where I am. Then they can see all the glory you gave me because you loved me even before the world began!
43Jn 17:25 "O righteous Father, the world doesn't know you, but I do; and these disciples know you sent me.
43Jn 17:26 I have revealed you to them, and I will continue to do so. Then your love for me will be in them, and I will be in them."
43Jn 18:1 After saying these things, Jesus crossed the Kidron Valley with his disciples and entered a grove of olive trees.
43Jn 18:2 Judas, the betrayer, knew this place, because Jesus had often gone there with his disciples.
43Jn 18:3 The leading priests and Pharisees had given Judas a contingent of Roman soldiers and Temple guards to accompany him. Now with blazing torches, lanterns, and weapons, they arrived at the olive grove.
43Jn 18:4 Jesus fully realized all that was going to happen to him, so he stepped forward to meet them. "Who are you looking for?" he asked.
43Jn 18:5 "Jesus the Nazarene,"®Á they replied. "I AM he,"®Ë Jesus said. (Judas, who betrayed him, was standing with them.) / ®ÁOr Jesus of Nazareth; also in 18.7
43Jn 18:6 As Jesus said "I AM he," they all drew back and fell to the ground! ®ËOr "The `I AM' is here"; or "I am the LORD"; Greek reads I am; also in 18.6, 8. See Exod 3.14
43Jn 18:7 Once more he asked them, "Who are you looking for?" And again they replied, "Jesus the Nazarene."
43Jn 18:8 "I told you that I AM he," Jesus said. "And since I am the one you want, let these others go."
43Jn 18:9 He did this to fulfill his own statement£∫ "I did not lose a single one of those you have given me."®Á / ®ÁSee John 6.39 and 17.12
43Jn 18:10 Then Simon Peter drew a sword and slashed off the right ear of Malchus, the high priest's slave.
43Jn 18:11 But Jesus said to Peter, "Put your sword back into its sheath. Shall I not drink from the cup of suffering the Father has given me?"
43Jn 18:12 So the soldiers, their commanding officer, and the Temple guards arrested Jesus and tied him up.
43Jn 18:13 First they took him to Annas, the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest at that time®Á. / ®ÁGreek that year
43Jn 18:14 Caiaphas was the one who had told the other Jewish leaders, "It's better that one man should die for the people."
43Jn 18:15 Simon Peter followed Jesus, as did another of the disciples. That other disciple was acquainted with the high priest, so he was allowed to enter the high priest's courtyard with Jesus.
43Jn 18:16 Peter had to stay outside the gate. Then the disciple who knew the high priest spoke to the woman watching at the gate, and she let Peter in.
43Jn 18:17 The woman asked Peter, "You're not one of that man's disciples, are you?" "No," he said, "I am not."
43Jn 18:18 Because it was cold, the household servants and the guards had made a charcoal fire. They stood around it, warming themselves, and Peter stood with them, warming himself.
43Jn 18:19 Inside, the high priest began asking Jesus about his followers and what he had been teaching them.
43Jn 18:20 Jesus replied, "Everyone knows what I teach. I have preached regularly in the synagogues and the Temple, where the people®Á gather. I have not spoken in secret. / ®ÁGreek Jewish people; also in 18.38
43Jn 18:21 Why are you asking me this question? Ask those who heard me. They know what I said."
43Jn 18:22 Then one of the Temple guards standing nearby slapped Jesus across the face. "Is that the way to answer the high priest?" he demanded.
43Jn 18:23 Jesus replied, "If I said anything wrong, you must prove it. But if I'm speaking the truth, why are you beating me?"
43Jn 18:24 Then Annas bound Jesus and sent him to Caiaphas, the high priest.
43Jn 18:25 Meanwhile, as Simon Peter was standing by the fire warming himself, they asked him again, "You're not one of his disciples, are you?" He denied it, saying, "No, I am not."
43Jn 18:26 But one of the household slaves of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, asked, "Didn't I see you out there in the olive grove with Jesus?"
43Jn 18:27 Again Peter denied it. And immediately a rooster crowed.
43Jn 18:28 Jesus' trial before Caiaphas ended in the early hours of the morning. Then he was taken to the headquarters of the Roman governor®Á. His accusers didn't go inside because it would defile them, and they wouldn't be allowed to celebrate the Passover. / ®ÁGreek to the Praetorium; also in 18.33
43Jn 18:29 So Pilate, the governor, went out to them and asked, "What is your charge against this man?"
43Jn 18:30 "We wouldn't have handed him over to you if he weren't a criminal!" they retorted.
43Jn 18:31 "Then take him away and judge him by your own law," Pilate told them. "Only the Romans are permitted to execute someone," the Jewish leaders replied.
43Jn 18:32 (This fulfilled Jesus' prediction about the way he would die®Á.) / ®ÁSee John 12.32-33
43Jn 18:33 Then Pilate went back into his headquarters and called for Jesus to be brought to him. "Are you the king of the Jews?" he asked him.
43Jn 18:34 Jesus replied, "Is this your own question, or did others tell you about me?"
43Jn 18:35 "Am I a Jew?" Pilate retorted. "Your own people and their leading priests brought you to me for trial. Why? What have you done?"
43Jn 18:36 Jesus answered, "My Kingdom is not an earthly kingdom. If it were, my followers would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jewish leaders. But my Kingdom is not of this world."
43Jn 18:37 Pilate said, "So you are a king?" Jesus responded, "You say I am a king. Actually, I was born and came into the world to testify to the truth. All who love the truth recognize that what I say is true."
43Jn 18:38 "What is truth?" Pilate asked. Then he went out again to the people and told them, "He is not guilty of any crime.
43Jn 18:39 But you have a custom of asking me to release one prisoner each year at Passover. Would you like me to release this `King of the Jews'?"
43Jn 18:40 But they shouted back, "No! Not this man. We want Barabbas!" ®Á / ®ÁBarabbas was a revolutionary
43Jn 19:1 Then Pilate had Jesus flogged with a lead-tipped whip.
43Jn 19:2 The soldiers wove a crown of thorns and put it on his head, and they put a purple robe on him.
43Jn 19:3 "Hail! King of the Jews!" they mocked, as they slapped him across the face.
43Jn 19:4 Pilate went outside again and said to the people, "I am going to bring him out to you now, but understand clearly that I find him not guilty."
43Jn 19:5 Then Jesus came out wearing the crown of thorns and the purple robe. And Pilate said, "Look, here is the man!"
43Jn 19:6 When they saw him, the leading priests and Temple guards began shouting, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" "Take him yourselves and crucify him," Pilate said. "I find him not guilty."
43Jn 19:7 The Jewish leaders replied, "By our law he ought to die because he called himself the Son of God."
43Jn 19:8 When Pilate heard this, he was more frightened than ever.
43Jn 19:9 He took Jesus back into the headquarters®Á again and asked him, "Where are you from?" But Jesus gave no answer. / ®ÁGreek the Praetorium
43Jn 19:10 "Why don't you talk to me?" Pilate demanded. "Don't you realize that I have the power to release you or crucify you?"
43Jn 19:11 Then Jesus said, "You would have no power over me at all unless it were given to you from above. So the one who handed me over to you has the greater sin."
43Jn 19:12 Then Pilate tried to release him, but the Jewish leaders shouted, "If you release this man, you are no `friend of Caesar.'®Á Anyone who declares himself a king is a rebel against Caesar." / ®Á"Friend of Caesar" is a technical term that refers to an ally of the emperor
43Jn 19:13 When they said this, Pilate brought Jesus out to them again. Then Pilate sat down on the judgment seat on the platform that is called the Stone Pavement®Á. / ®Áin Hebrew, Gabbatha
43Jn 19:14 It was now about noon on the day of preparation for the Passover. And Pilate said to the people®Á, "Look, here is your king!" / ®ÁGreek Jewish people; also in 19.20
43Jn 19:15 "Away with him," they yelled. "Away with him! Crucify him!" "What? Crucify your king?" Pilate asked. "We have no king but Caesar," the leading priests shouted back.
43Jn 19:16 Then Pilate turned Jesus over to them to be crucified. So they took Jesus away.
43Jn 19:17 Carrying the cross by himself, he went to the place called Place of the Skull®Á. / ®Áin Hebrew, Golgotha
43Jn 19:18 There they nailed him to the cross. Two others were crucified with him, one on either side, with Jesus between them.
43Jn 19:19 And Pilate posted a sign over him that read, "Jesus of Nazareth®Á, the King of the Jews." / ®ÁOr Jesus the Nazarene
43Jn 19:20 The place where Jesus was crucified was near the city, and the sign was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek, so that many people could read it.
43Jn 19:21 Then the leading priests objected and said to Pilate, "Change it from `The King of the Jews' to `He said, I am King of the Jews.'"
43Jn 19:22 Pilate replied, "No, what I have written, I have written."
43Jn 19:23 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they divided his clothes among the four of them. They also took his robe, but it was seamless, woven in one piece from top to bottom.
43Jn 19:24 So they said, "Rather than tearing it apart, let's throw dice®Á for it." This fulfilled the Scripture that says, "They divided my garments among themselves and threw dice for my clothing."®Ë So that is what they did. / ®ÁGreek cast lots ®ËPs 22.18
43Jn 19:25 Standing near the cross were Jesus' mother, and his mother's sister, Mary (the wife of Clopas), and Mary Magdalene.
43Jn 19:26 When Jesus saw his mother standing there beside the disciple he loved, he said to her, "Dear woman, here is your son."
43Jn 19:27 And he said to this disciple, "Here is your mother." And from then on this disciple took her into his home.
43Jn 19:28 Jesus knew that his mission was now finished, and to fulfill Scripture he said, "I am thirsty."®Á / ®ÁSee Pss 22.15; 69.21
43Jn 19:29 A jar of sour wine was sitting there, so they soaked a sponge in it, put it on a hyssop branch, and held it up to his lips.
43Jn 19:30 When Jesus had tasted it, he said, "It is finished!" Then he bowed his head and released his spirit.
43Jn 19:31 It was the day of preparation, and the Jewish leaders didn't want the bodies hanging there the next day, which was the Sabbath ®Á. So they asked Pilate to hasten their deaths by ordering that their legs be broken. Then their bodies could be taken down. / ®Áand a very special Sabbath, because it was the Passover
43Jn 19:32 So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the two men crucified with Jesus.
43Jn 19:33 But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was already dead, so they didn't break his legs.
43Jn 19:34 One of the soldiers, however, pierced his side with a spear, and immediately blood and water flowed out.
43Jn 19:35 (This report is from an eyewitness giving an accurate account. He speaks the truth so that you also can believe®Á.) / ®ÁSome manuscripts read can continue to believe
43Jn 19:36 These things happened in fulfillment of the Scriptures that say, "Not one of his bones will be broken,"®Á / ®ÁExod 12.46; Num 9.12; Ps 34.20
43Jn 19:37 and "They will look on the one they pierced."®Á / ®ÁZech 12.10
43Jn 19:38 Afterward Joseph of Arimathea, who had been a secret disciple of Jesus (because he feared the Jewish leaders), asked Pilate for permission to take down Jesus' body. When Pilate gave permission, Joseph came and took the body away.
43Jn 19:39 With him came Nicodemus, the man who had come to Jesus at night. He brought seventy-five pounds®Á of perfumed ointment made from myrrh and aloes. / ®ÁGreek 100 litras [32.7 kilograms]
43Jn 19:40 Following Jewish burial custom, they wrapped Jesus' body with the spices in long sheets of linen cloth.
43Jn 19:41 The place of crucifixion was near a garden, where there was a new tomb, never used before.
43Jn 19:42 And so, because it was the day of preparation for the Jewish Passover®Á and since the tomb was close at hand, they laid Jesus there. / ®ÁGreek because of the Jewish day of preparation
43Jn 20:1 Early on Sunday morning®Á, while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene came to the tomb and found that the stone had been rolled away from the entrance. / ®ÁGreek On the first day of the week.
43Jn 20:2 She ran and found Simon Peter and the other disciple, the one whom Jesus loved. She said, "They have taken the Lord's body out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"
43Jn 20:3 Peter and the other disciple started out for the tomb.
43Jn 20:4 They were both running, but the other disciple outran Peter and reached the tomb first.
43Jn 20:5 He stooped and looked in and saw the linen wrappings lying there, but he didn't go in.
43Jn 20:6 Then Simon Peter arrived and went inside. He also noticed the linen wrappings lying there,
43Jn 20:7 while the cloth that had covered Jesus' head was folded up and lying apart from the other wrappings.
43Jn 20:8 Then the disciple who had reached the tomb first also went in, and he saw and believed?
43Jn 20:9 for until then they still hadn't understood the Scriptures that said Jesus must rise from the dead.
43Jn 20:10 Then they went home.
43Jn 20:11 Mary was standing outside the tomb crying, and as she wept, she stooped and looked in.
43Jn 20:12 She saw two white-robed angels, one sitting at the head and the other at the foot of the place where the body of Jesus had been lying.
43Jn 20:13 "Dear woman, why are you crying?" the angels asked her. "Because they have taken away my Lord," she replied, "and I don't know where they have put him."
43Jn 20:14 She turned to leave and saw someone standing there. It was Jesus, but she didn't recognize him.
43Jn 20:15 "Dear woman, why are you crying?" Jesus asked her. "Who are you looking for?" She thought he was the gardener. "Sir," she said, "if you have taken him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will go and get him."
43Jn 20:16 "Mary!" Jesus said. She turned to him and cried out, "Rabboni!" (which is Hebrew for "Teacher").
43Jn 20:17 "Don't cling to me," Jesus said, "for I haven't yet ascended to the Father. But go find my brothers and tell them, `I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'"
43Jn 20:18 Mary Magdalene found the disciples and told them, "I have seen the Lord!" Then she gave them his message.
43Jn 20:19 That Sunday evening®Á the disciples were meeting behind locked doors because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders. Suddenly, Jesus was standing there among them! "Peace be with you," he said. / ®ÁGreek In the evening of that day, the first day of the week.
43Jn 20:20 As he spoke, he showed them the wounds in his hands and his side. They were filled with joy when they saw the Lord!
43Jn 20:21 Again he said, "Peace be with you. As the Father has sent me, so I am sending you."
43Jn 20:22 Then he breathed on them and said, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
43Jn 20:23 If you forgive anyone's sins, they are forgiven. If you do not forgive them, they are not forgiven."
43Jn 20:24 One of the twelve disciples, Thomas (nicknamed the Twin)®Á, was not with the others when Jesus came. / ®ÁGreek Thomas, who was called Didymus
43Jn 20:25 They told him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he replied, "I won't believe it unless I see the nail wounds in his hands, put my fingers into them, and place my hand into the wound in his side."
43Jn 20:26 Eight days later the disciples were together again, and this time Thomas was with them. The doors were locked; but suddenly, as before, Jesus was standing among them. "Peace be with you," he said.
43Jn 20:27 Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Put your hand into the wound in my side. Don't be faithless any longer. Believe!"
43Jn 20:28 "My Lord and my God!" Thomas exclaimed.
43Jn 20:29 Then Jesus told him, "You believe because you have seen me. Blessed are those who believe without seeing me."
43Jn 20:30 The disciples saw Jesus do many other miraculous signs in addition to the ones recorded in this book.
43Jn 20:31 But these are written so that you may continue to believe®Á that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing in him you will have life by the power of his name. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read that you may believe
43Jn 21:1 Later, Jesus appeared again to the disciples beside the Sea of Galilee®Á. This is how it happened. / ®ÁGreek Sea of Tiberias, another name for the Sea of Galilee
43Jn 21:2 Several of the disciples were there - Simon Peter, Thomas (nicknamed the Twin)®Á, Nathanael from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two other disciples. / ®ÁGreek Thomas, who was called Didymus
43Jn 21:3 Simon Peter said, "I'm going fishing." "We'll come, too," they all said. So they went out in the boat, but they caught nothing all night.
43Jn 21:4 At dawn Jesus was standing on the beach, but the disciples couldn't see who he was.
43Jn 21:5 He called out, "Fellows®Á, have you caught any fish?" "No," they replied. / ®ÁGreek Children
43Jn 21:6 Then he said, "Throw out your net on the right-hand side of the boat, and you'll get some!" So they did, and they couldn't haul in the net because there were so many fish in it.
43Jn 21:7 Then the disciple Jesus loved said to Peter, "It's the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put on his tunic (for he had stripped for work), jumped into the water, and headed to shore.
43Jn 21:8 The others stayed with the boat and pulled the loaded net to the shore, for they were only about a hundred yards®Á from shore. / ®ÁGreek 200 cubits [90 meters]
43Jn 21:9 When they got there, they found breakfast waiting for them?fish cooking over a charcoal fire, and some bread.
43Jn 21:10 "Bring some of the fish you've just caught," Jesus said.
43Jn 21:11 So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net to the shore. There were 153 large fish, and yet the net hadn't torn.
43Jn 21:12 "Now come and have some breakfast!" Jesus said. None of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?" They knew it was the Lord.
43Jn 21:13 Then Jesus served them the bread and the fish.
43Jn 21:14 This was the third time Jesus had appeared to his disciples since he had been raised from the dead.
43Jn 21:15 After breakfast Jesus asked Simon Peter, "Simon son of John, do you love me more than these?®Á" "Yes, Lord," Peter replied, "you know I love you." "Then feed my lambs," Jesus told him. / ®ÁOr more than these others do?
43Jn 21:16 Jesus repeated the question£∫ "Simon son of John, do you love me?" "Yes, Lord," Peter said, "you know I love you." "Then take care of my sheep," Jesus said.
43Jn 21:17 A third time he asked him, "Simon son of John, do you love me?" Peter was hurt that Jesus asked the question a third time. He said, "Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you." Jesus said, "Then feed my sheep.
43Jn 21:18 "I tell you the truth, when you were young, you were able to do as you liked; you dressed yourself and went wherever you wanted to go. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and others®Á will dress you and take you where you don't want to go." / ®ÁSome manuscripts read and another one
43Jn 21:19 Jesus said this to let him know by what kind of death he would glorify God. Then Jesus told him, "Follow me."
43Jn 21:20 Peter turned around and saw behind them the disciple Jesus loved?the one who had leaned over to Jesus during supper and asked, "Lord, who will betray you?"
43Jn 21:21 Peter asked Jesus, "What about him, Lord?"
43Jn 21:22 Jesus replied, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you? As for you, follow me."
43Jn 21:23 So the rumor spread among the community of believers®Á that this disciple wouldn't die. But that isn't what Jesus said at all. He only said, "If I want him to remain alive until I return, what is that to you?" / ®ÁGreek the brothers
43Jn 21:24 This disciple is the one who testifies to these events and has recorded them here. And we know that his account of these things is accurate.
43Jn 21:25 Jesus also did many other things. If they were all written down, I suppose the whole world could not contain the books that would be written.
