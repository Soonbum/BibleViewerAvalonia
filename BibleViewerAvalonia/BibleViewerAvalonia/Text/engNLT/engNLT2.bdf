05Dt 1:1 These are the words that Moses spoke to all the people of Israel while they were in the wilderness east of the Jordan River. They were camped in the Jordan Valley¨ç near Suph, between Paran on one side and Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab on the other. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Arabah; also in 1.7}
05Dt 1:2 Normally it takes only eleven days to travel from Mount Sinai¨ç to Kadesh-barnea, going by way of Mount Seir. / ¨ç{Hebrew Horeb, another name for Sinai; also in 1.6, 19}
05Dt 1:3 But forty years after the Israelites left Egypt, on the first day of the eleventh month¨ç, Moses addressed the people of Israel, telling them everything the LORD had commanded him to say. / ¨ç{Hebrew In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month. This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in January or February}
05Dt 1:4 This took place after he had defeated King Sihon of the Amorites, who had ruled in Heshbon, and King Og of Bashan, who had ruled in Ashtaroth and Edrei.
05Dt 1:5 While the Israelites were in the land of Moab east of the Jordan River, Moses carefully explained the LORD's instructions as follows.
05Dt 1:6 "When we were at Mount Sinai, the LORD our God said to us, 'You have stayed at this mountain long enough.
05Dt 1:7 It is time to break camp and move on. Go to the hill country of the Amorites and to all the neighboring regions - the Jordan Valley, the hill country, the western foothills¨ç, the Negev, and the coastal plain. Go to the land of the Canaanites and to Lebanon, and all the way to the great Euphrates River. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Shephelah}
05Dt 1:8 Look, I am giving all this land to you! Go in and occupy it, for it is the land the LORD swore to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and to all their descendants.'"
05Dt 1:9 Moses continued, "At that time I told you, 'You are too great a burden for me to carry all by myself.
05Dt 1:10 The LORD your God has increased your population, making you as numerous as the stars!
05Dt 1:11 And may the LORD, the God of your ancestors, multiply you a thousand times more and bless you as he promised!
05Dt 1:12 But you are such a heavy load to carry! How can I deal with all your problems and bickering?
05Dt 1:13 Choose some well-respected men from each tribe who are known for their wisdom and understanding, and I will appoint them as your leaders.'
05Dt 1:14 "Then you responded, 'Your plan is a good one.'
05Dt 1:15 So I took the wise and respected men you had selected from your tribes and appointed them to serve as judges and officials over you. Some were responsible for a thousand people, some for a hundred, some for fifty, and some for ten.
05Dt 1:16 "At that time I instructed the judges, 'You must hear the cases of your fellow Israelites and the foreigners living among you. Be perfectly fair in your decisions
05Dt 1:17 and impartial in your judgments. Hear the cases of those who are poor as well as those who are rich. Don't be afraid of anyone's anger, for the decision you make is God's decision. Bring me any cases that are too difficult for you, and I will handle them.'
05Dt 1:18 "At that time I gave you instructions about everything you were to do.
05Dt 1:19 "Then, just as the LORD our God commanded us, we left Mount Sinai and traveled through the great and terrifying wilderness, as you yourselves remember, and headed toward the hill country of the Amorites. When we arrived at Kadesh-barnea,
05Dt 1:20 I said to you, 'You have now reached the hill country of the Amorites that the LORD our God is giving us.
05Dt 1:21 Look! He has placed the land in front of you. Go and occupy it as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has promised you. Don't be afraid! Don't be discouraged!'
05Dt 1:22 "But you all came to me and said, 'First, let's send out scouts to explore the land for us. They will advise us on the best route to take and which towns we should enter.'
05Dt 1:23 "This seemed like a good idea to me, so I chose twelve scouts, one from each of your tribes.
05Dt 1:24 They headed for the hill country and came to the valley of Eshcol and explored it.
05Dt 1:25 They picked some of its fruit and brought it back to us. And they reported, 'The land the LORD our God has given us is indeed a good land.'
05Dt 1:26 "But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God and refused to go in.
05Dt 1:27 You complained in your tents and said, 'The LORD must hate us. That's why he has brought us here from Egypt - to hand us over to the Amorites to be slaughtered.
05Dt 1:28 Where can we go? Our brothers have demoralized us with their report. They tell us, "The people of the land are taller and more powerful than we are, and their towns are large, with walls rising high into the sky! We even saw giants there - the descendants of Anak!"'
05Dt 1:29 "But I said to you, 'Don't be shocked or afraid of them!
05Dt 1:30 The LORD your God is going ahead of you. He will fight for you, just as you saw him do in Egypt.
05Dt 1:31 And you saw how the LORD your God cared for you all along the way as you traveled through the wilderness, just as a father cares for his child. Now he has brought you to this place.'
05Dt 1:32 "But even after all he did, you refused to trust the LORD your God,
05Dt 1:33 who goes before you looking for the best places to camp, guiding you with a pillar of fire by night and a pillar of cloud by day.
05Dt 1:34 "When the LORD heard your complaining, he became very angry. So he solemnly swore,
05Dt 1:35 'Not one of you from this wicked generation will live to see the good land I swore to give your ancestors,
05Dt 1:36 except Caleb son of Jephunneh. He will see this land because he has followed the LORD completely. I will give to him and his descendants some of the very land he explored during his scouting mission.'
05Dt 1:37 "And the LORD was also angry with me because of you. He said to me, 'Moses, not even you will enter the Promised Land!
05Dt 1:38 Instead, your assistant, Joshua son of Nun, will lead the people into the land. Encourage him, for he will lead Israel as they take possession of it.
05Dt 1:39 I will give the land to your little ones - your innocent children. You were afraid they would be captured, but they will be the ones who occupy it.
05Dt 1:40 As for you, turn around now and go on back through the wilderness toward the Red Sea¨ç.' / ¨ç{Hebrew sea of reeds}
05Dt 1:41 "Then you confessed, 'We have sinned against the LORD! We will go into the land and fight for it, as the LORD our God has commanded us.' So your men strapped on their weapons, thinking it would be easy to attack the hill country.
05Dt 1:42 "But the LORD told me to tell you, 'Do not attack, for I am not with you. If you go ahead on your own, you will be crushed by your enemies.'
05Dt 1:43 "This is what I told you, but you would not listen. Instead, you again rebelled against the LORD's command and arrogantly went into the hill country to fight.
05Dt 1:44 But the Amorites who lived there came out against you like a swarm of bees. They chased and battered you all the way from Seir to Hormah.
05Dt 1:45 Then you returned and wept before the LORD, but he refused to listen.
05Dt 1:46 So you stayed there at Kadesh for a long time.
05Dt 2:1 "Then we turned around and headed back across the wilderness toward the Red Sea¨ç, just as the LORD had instructed me, and we wandered around in the region of Mount Seir for a long time. / ¨ç{Hebrew sea of reeds}
05Dt 2:2 "Then at last the LORD said to me,
05Dt 2:3 'You have been wandering around in this hill country long enough; turn to the north.
05Dt 2:4 Give these orders to the people£º "You will pass through the country belonging to your relatives the Edomites, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. The Edomites will feel threatened, so be careful.
05Dt 2:5 Do not bother them, for I have given them all the hill country around Mount Seir as their property, and I will not give you even one square foot of their land.
05Dt 2:6 If you need food to eat or water to drink, pay them for it.
05Dt 2:7 For the LORD your God has blessed you in everything you have done. He has watched your every step through this great wilderness. During these forty years, the LORD your God has been with you, and you have lacked nothing."'
05Dt 2:8 "So we bypassed the territory of our relatives, the descendants of Esau, who live in Seir. We avoided the road through the Arabah Valley that comes up from Elath and Ezion-geber. "Then as we turned north along the desert route through Moab,
05Dt 2:9 the LORD warned us, 'Do not bother the Moabites, the descendants of Lot, or start a war with them. I have given them Ar as their property, and I will not give you any of their land.'"
05Dt 2:10 (A race of giants called the Emites had once lived in the area of Ar. They were as strong and numerous and tall as the Anakites, another race of giants.
05Dt 2:11 Both the Emites and the Anakites are also known as the Rephaites, though the Moabites call them Emites.
05Dt 2:12 In earlier times the Horites had lived in Seir, but they were driven out and displaced by the descendants of Esau, just as Israel drove out the people of Canaan when the LORD gave Israel their land.)
05Dt 2:13 Moses continued, "Then the LORD said to us, 'Get moving. Cross the Zered Brook.' So we crossed the brook.
05Dt 2:14 "Thirty-eight years passed from the time we first left Kadesh-barnea until we finally crossed the Zered Brook! By then, all the men old enough to fight in battle had died in the wilderness, as the LORD had vowed would happen.
05Dt 2:15 The LORD struck them down until they had all been eliminated from the community.
05Dt 2:16 "When all the men of fighting age had died,
05Dt 2:17 the LORD said to me,
05Dt 2:18 'Today you will cross the border of Moab at Ar
05Dt 2:19 and enter the land of the Ammonites, the descendants of Lot. But do not bother them or start a war with them. I have given the land of Ammon to them as their property, and I will not give you any of their land.'"
05Dt 2:20 (That area was once considered the land of the Rephaites, who had lived there, though the Ammonites call them Zamzummites.
05Dt 2:21 They were also as strong and numerous and tall as the Anakites. But the LORD destroyed them so the Ammonites could occupy their land.
05Dt 2:22 He had done the same for the descendants of Esau who lived in Seir, for he destroyed the Horites so they could settle there in their place. The descendants of Esau live there to this day.
05Dt 2:23 A similar thing happened when the Caphtorites from Crete¨ç invaded and destroyed the Avvites, who had lived in villages in the area of Gaza.) / ¨ç{Hebrew from Caphtor}
05Dt 2:24 Moses continued, "Then the LORD said, 'Now get moving! Cross the Arnon Gorge. Look, I will hand over to you Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and I will give you his land. Attack him and begin to occupy the land.
05Dt 2:25 Beginning today I will make people throughout the earth terrified because of you. When they hear reports about you, they will tremble with dread and fear.'"
05Dt 2:26 Moses continued, "From the wilderness of Kedemoth I sent ambassadors to King Sihon of Heshbon with this proposal of peace.
05Dt 2:27 'Let us travel through your land. We will stay on the main road and won't turn off into the fields on either side.
05Dt 2:28 Sell us food to eat and water to drink, and we will pay for it. All we want is permission to pass through your land.
05Dt 2:29 The descendants of Esau who live in Seir allowed us to go through their country, and so did the Moabites, who live in Ar. Let us pass through until we cross the Jordan into the land the LORD our God is giving us.'
05Dt 2:30 "But King Sihon of Heshbon refused to allow us to pass through, because the LORD your God made Sihon stubborn and defiant so he could help you defeat him, as he has now done.
05Dt 2:31 "Then the LORD said to me, 'Look, I have begun to hand King Sihon and his land over to you. Begin now to conquer and occupy his land.'
05Dt 2:32 "Then King Sihon declared war on us and mobilized his forces at Jahaz.
05Dt 2:33 But the LORD our God handed him over to us, and we crushed him, his sons, and all his people.
05Dt 2:34 We conquered all his towns and completely destroyed¨ç everyone - men, women, and children. Not a single person was spared. / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering}
05Dt 2:35 We took all the livestock as plunder for ourselves, along with anything of value from the towns we ransacked.
05Dt 2:36 "The LORD our God also helped us conquer Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Gorge, and the town in the gorge, and the whole area as far as Gilead. No town had walls too strong for us.
05Dt 2:37 However, we avoided the land of the Ammonites all along the Jabbok River and the towns in the hill country - all the places the LORD our God had commanded us to leave alone.
05Dt 3:1 "Next we turned and headed for the land of Bashan, where King Og and his entire army attacked us at Edrei.
05Dt 3:2 But the LORD told me, 'Do not be afraid of him, for I have given you victory over Og and his entire army, and I will give you all his land. Treat him just as you treated King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled in Heshbon.'
05Dt 3:3 "So the LORD our God handed King Og and all his people over to us, and we killed them all. Not a single person survived.
05Dt 3:4 We conquered all sixty of his towns - the entire Argob region in his kingdom of Bashan. Not a single town escaped our conquest.
05Dt 3:5 These towns were all fortified with high walls and barred gates. We also took many unwalled villages at the same time.
05Dt 3:6 We completely destroyed¨ç the kingdom of Bashan, just as we had destroyed King Sihon of Heshbon. We destroyed all the people in every town we conquered - men, women, and children alike. / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; also in 3.6b}
05Dt 3:7 But we kept all the livestock for ourselves and took plunder from all the towns.
05Dt 3:8 "So we took the land of the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River - all the way from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon.
05Dt 3:9 (Mount Hermon is called Sirion by the Sidonians, and the Amorites call it Senir.)
05Dt 3:10 We had now conquered all the cities on the plateau and all Gilead and Bashan, as far as the towns of Salecah and Edrei, which were part of Og's kingdom in Bashan.
05Dt 3:11 (King Og of Bashan was the last survivor of the giant Rephaites. His bed was made of iron and was more than thirteen feet long and six feet wide¨ç. It can still be seen in the Ammonite city of Rabbah.) / ¨ç{Hebrew 9 cubits [4.1 meters] long and 4 cubits [1.8 meters] wide}
05Dt 3:12 "When we took possession of this land, I gave to the tribes of Reuben and Gad the territory beyond Aroer along the Arnon Gorge, plus half of the hill country of Gilead with its towns.
05Dt 3:13 Then I gave the rest of Gilead and all of Bashan - Og's former kingdom - to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (This entire Argob region of Bashan used to be known as the land of the Rephaites.
05Dt 3:14 Jair, a leader from the tribe of Manasseh, conquered the whole Argob region in Bashan, all the way to the border of the Geshurites and Maacathites. Jair renamed this region after himself, calling it the Towns of Jair¨ç, as it is still known today.) / ¨ç{Hebrew Havvoth-jair}
05Dt 3:15 I gave Gilead to the clan of Makir.
05Dt 3:16 But I also gave part of Gilead to the tribes of Reuben and Gad. The area I gave them extended from the middle of the Arnon Gorge in the south to the Jabbok River on the Ammonite frontier.
05Dt 3:17 They also received the Jordan Valley, all the way from the Sea of Galilee down to the Dead Sea¨ç, with the Jordan River serving as the western boundary. To the east were the slopes of Pisgah. / ¨ç{Hebrew from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea}
05Dt 3:18 "At that time I gave this command to the tribes that would live east of the Jordan£º 'Although the LORD your God has given you this land as your property, all your fighting men must cross the Jordan ahead of your Israelite relatives, armed and ready to assist them.
05Dt 3:19 Your wives, children, and numerous livestock, however, may stay behind in the towns I have given you.
05Dt 3:20 When the LORD has given security to the rest of the Israelites, as he has to you, and when they occupy the land the LORD your God is giving them across the Jordan River, then you may all return here to the land I have given you.'
05Dt 3:21 "At that time I gave Joshua this charge£º 'You have seen for yourself everything the LORD your God has done to these two kings. He will do the same to all the kingdoms on the west side of the Jordan.
05Dt 3:22 Do not be afraid of the nations there, for the LORD your God will fight for you.'
05Dt 3:23 "At that time I pleaded with the LORD and said,
05Dt 3:24 'O Sovereign LORD, you have only begun to show your greatness and the strength of your hand to me, your servant. Is there any god in heaven or on earth who can perform such great and mighty deeds as you do?
05Dt 3:25 Please let me cross the Jordan to see the wonderful land on the other side, the beautiful hill country and the Lebanon mountains.'
05Dt 3:26 "But the LORD was angry with me because of you, and he would not listen to me. 'That's enough!' he declared. 'Speak of it no more.
05Dt 3:27 But go up to Pisgah Peak, and look over the land in every direction. Take a good look, but you may not cross the Jordan River.
05Dt 3:28 Instead, commission Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he will lead the people across the Jordan. He will give them all the land you now see before you as their possession.'
05Dt 3:29 So we stayed in the valley near Beth-peor.
05Dt 4:1 "And now, Israel, listen carefully to these decrees and regulations that I am about to teach you. Obey them so that you may live, so you may enter and occupy the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, is giving you.
05Dt 4:2 Do not add to or subtract from these commands I am giving you. Just obey the commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you.
05Dt 4:3 "You saw for yourself what the LORD did to you at Baal-peor. There the LORD your God destroyed everyone who had worshiped Baal, the god of Peor.
05Dt 4:4 But all of you who were faithful to the LORD your God are still alive today - every one of you.
05Dt 4:5 "Look, I now teach you these decrees and regulations just as the LORD my God commanded me, so that you may obey them in the land you are about to enter and occupy.
05Dt 4:6 Obey them completely, and you will display your wisdom and intelligence among the surrounding nations. When they hear all these decrees, they will exclaim, 'How wise and prudent are the people of this great nation!'
05Dt 4:7 For what great nation has a god as near to them as the LORD our God is near to us whenever we call on him?
05Dt 4:8 And what great nation has decrees and regulations as righteous and fair as this body of instructions that I am giving you today?
05Dt 4:9 "But watch out! Be careful never to forget what you yourself have seen. Do not let these memories escape from your mind as long as you live! And be sure to pass them on to your children and grandchildren.
05Dt 4:10 Never forget the day when you stood before the LORD your God at Mount Sinai¨ç, where he told me, 'Summon the people before me, and I will personally instruct them. Then they will learn to fear me as long as they live, and they will teach their children to fear me also.' / ¨ç{Hebrew Horeb, another name for Sinai; also in 4.15}
05Dt 4:11 "You came near and stood at the foot of the mountain, while flames from the mountain shot into the sky. The mountain was shrouded in black clouds and deep darkness.
05Dt 4:12 And the LORD spoke to you from the heart of the fire. You heard the sound of his words but didn't see his form; there was only a voice.
05Dt 4:13 He proclaimed his covenant - the Ten Commandments¨ç - which he commanded you to keep, and which he wrote on two stone tablets. / ¨ç{Hebrew the ten words}
05Dt 4:14 It was at that time that the LORD commanded me to teach you his decrees and regulations so you would obey them in the land you are about to enter and occupy.
05Dt 4:15 "But be very careful! You did not see the LORD's form on the day he spoke to you from the heart of the fire at Mount Sinai.
05Dt 4:16 So do not corrupt yourselves by making an idol in any form - whether of a man or a woman,
05Dt 4:17 an animal on the ground, a bird in the sky,
05Dt 4:18 a small animal that scurries along the ground, or a fish in the deepest sea.
05Dt 4:19 And when you look up into the sky and see the sun, moon, and stars - all the forces of heaven - don't be seduced into worshiping them. The LORD your God gave them to all the peoples of the earth.
05Dt 4:20 Remember that the LORD rescued you from the iron-smelting furnace of Egypt in order to make you his very own people and his special possession, which is what you are today.
05Dt 4:21 "But the LORD was angry with me because of you. He vowed that I would not cross the Jordan River into the good land the LORD your God is giving you as your special possession.
05Dt 4:22 You will cross the Jordan to occupy the land, but I will not. Instead, I will die here on the east side of the river.
05Dt 4:23 So be careful not to break the covenant the LORD your God has made with you. Do not make idols of any shape or form, for the LORD your God has forbidden this.
05Dt 4:24 The LORD your God is a devouring fire; he is a jealous God.
05Dt 4:25 "In the future, when you have children and grandchildren and have lived in the land a long time, do not corrupt yourselves by making idols of any kind. This is evil in the sight of the LORD your God and will arouse his anger.
05Dt 4:26 "Today I call on heaven and earth as witnesses against you. If you break my covenant, you will quickly disappear from the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy. You will live there only a short time; then you will be utterly destroyed.
05Dt 4:27 For the LORD will scatter you among the nations, where only a few of you will survive.
05Dt 4:28 There, in a foreign land, you will worship idols made from wood and stone - gods that neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell.
05Dt 4:29 But from there you will search again for the LORD your God. And if you search for him with all your heart and soul, you will find him.
05Dt 4:30 "In the distant future, when you are suffering all these things, you will finally return to the LORD your God and listen to what he tells you.
05Dt 4:31 For the LORD your God is a merciful God; he will not abandon you or destroy you or forget the solemn covenant he made with your ancestors.
05Dt 4:32 "Now search all of history, from the time God created people on the earth until now, and search from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything as great as this ever been seen or heard before?
05Dt 4:33 Has any nation ever heard the voice of God¨ç speaking from fire - as you did - and survived? / ¨ç{Or voice of a god}
05Dt 4:34 Has any other god dared to take a nation for himself out of another nation by means of trials, miraculous signs, wonders, war, a strong hand, a powerful arm, and terrifying acts? Yet that is what the LORD your God did for you in Egypt, right before your eyes.
05Dt 4:35 "He showed you these things so you would know that the LORD is God and there is no other.
05Dt 4:36 He let you hear his voice from heaven so he could instruct you. He let you see his great fire here on earth so he could speak to you from it.
05Dt 4:37 Because he loved your ancestors, he chose to bless their descendants, and he personally brought you out of Egypt with a great display of power.
05Dt 4:38 He drove out nations far greater than you, so he could bring you in and give you their land as your special possession, as it is today.
05Dt 4:39 "So remember this and keep it firmly in mind£º The LORD is God both in heaven and on earth, and there is no other.
05Dt 4:40 If you obey all the decrees and commands I am giving you today, all will be well with you and your children. I am giving you these instructions so you will enjoy a long life in the land the LORD your God is giving you for all time."
05Dt 4:41 Then Moses set apart three cities of refuge east of the Jordan River.
05Dt 4:42 Anyone who killed another person unintentionally, without previous hostility, could flee there to live in safety.
05Dt 4:43 These were the cities£º Bezer on the wilderness plateau for the tribe of Reuben; Ramoth in Gilead for the tribe of Gad; Golan in Bashan for the tribe of Manasseh.
05Dt 4:44 This is the body of instruction that Moses presented to the Israelites.
05Dt 4:45 These are the laws, decrees, and regulations that Moses gave to the people of Israel when they left Egypt,
05Dt 4:46 and as they camped in the valley near Beth-peor east of the Jordan River. (This land was formerly occupied by the Amorites under King Sihon, who ruled from Heshbon. But Moses and the Israelites destroyed him and his people when they came up from Egypt.
05Dt 4:47 Israel took possession of his land and that of King Og of Bashan - the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan.
05Dt 4:48 So Israel conquered the entire area from Aroer at the edge of the Arnon Gorge all the way to Mount Sirion¨ç, also called Mount Hermon. / ¨ç{As in Syriac version (see also 3.9); Hebrew reads Mount Sion}
05Dt 4:49 And they conquered the eastern bank of the Jordan River as far south as the Dead Sea¨ç, below the slopes of Pisgah.) / ¨ç{Hebrew took the Arabah on the east side of the Jordan as far as the sea of the Arabah}
05Dt 5:1 Moses called all the people of Israel together and said, "Listen carefully, Israel. Hear the decrees and regulations I am giving you today, so you may learn them and obey them!
05Dt 5:2 "The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Mount Sinai¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew Horeb, another name for Sinai}
05Dt 5:3 The LORD did not make this covenant with our ancestors, but with all of us who are alive today.
05Dt 5:4 At the mountain the LORD spoke to you face to face from the heart of the fire.
05Dt 5:5 I stood as an intermediary between you and the LORD, for you were afraid of the fire and did not want to approach the mountain. He spoke to me, and I passed his words on to you. This is what he said.
05Dt 5:6 "I am the LORD your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt, the place of your slavery.
05Dt 5:7 "You must not have any other god but me.
05Dt 5:8 "You must not make for yourself an idol of any kind, or an image of anything in the heavens or on the earth or in the sea.
05Dt 5:9 You must not bow down to them or worship them, for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous God who will not tolerate your affection for any other gods. I lay the sins of the parents upon their children; the entire family is affected - even children in the third and fourth generations of those who reject me.
05Dt 5:10 But I lavish unfailing love for a thousand generations on those¨ç who love me and obey my commands. / ¨ç{Hebrew for thousands of those}
05Dt 5:11 "You must not misuse the name of the LORD your God. The LORD will not let you go unpunished if you misuse his name.
05Dt 5:12 "Observe the Sabbath day by keeping it holy, as the LORD your God has commanded you.
05Dt 5:13 You have six days each week for your ordinary work,
05Dt 5:14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath day of rest dedicated to the LORD your God. On that day no one in your household may do any work. This includes you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, your oxen and donkeys and other livestock, and any foreigners living among you. All your male and female servants must rest as you do.
05Dt 5:15 Remember that you were once slaves in Egypt, but the LORD your God brought you out with his strong hand and powerful arm. That is why the LORD your God has commanded you to rest on the Sabbath day.
05Dt 5:16 "Honor your father and mother, as the LORD your God commanded you. Then you will live a long, full life in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 5:17 "You must not murder.
05Dt 5:18 "You must not commit adultery.
05Dt 5:19 "You must not steal.
05Dt 5:20 "You must not testify falsely against your neighbor.
05Dt 5:21 "You must not covet your neighbor's wife. You must not covet your neighbor's house or land, male or female servant, ox or donkey, or anything else that belongs to your neighbor.
05Dt 5:22 "The LORD spoke these words to all of you assembled there at the foot of the mountain. He spoke with a loud voice from the heart of the fire, surrounded by clouds and deep darkness. This was all he said at that time, and he wrote his words on two stone tablets and gave them to me.
05Dt 5:23 "But when you heard the voice from the heart of the darkness, while the mountain was blazing with fire, all your tribal leaders and elders came to me.
05Dt 5:24 They said, 'Look, the LORD our God has shown us his glory and greatness, and we have heard his voice from the heart of the fire. Today we have seen that God can speak to us humans, and yet we live!
05Dt 5:25 But now, why should we risk death again? If the LORD our God speaks to us again, we will certainly die and be consumed by this awesome fire.
05Dt 5:26 Can any living thing hear the voice of the living God from the heart of the fire as we did and yet survive?
05Dt 5:27 Go yourself and listen to what the LORD our God says. Then come and tell us everything he tells you, and we will listen and obey.'
05Dt 5:28 "The LORD heard the request you made to me. And he said, 'I have heard what the people said to you, and they are right.
05Dt 5:29 Oh, that they would always have hearts like this, that they might fear me and obey all my commands! If they did, they and their descendants would prosper forever.
05Dt 5:30 Go and tell them, "Return to your tents."
05Dt 5:31 But you stand here with me so I can give you all my commands, decrees, and regulations. You must teach them to the people so they can obey them in the land I am giving them as their possession.'"
05Dt 5:32 So Moses told the people, "You must be careful to obey all the commands of the LORD your God, following his instructions in every detail.
05Dt 5:33 Stay on the path that the LORD your God has commanded you to follow. Then you will live long and prosperous lives in the land you are about to enter and occupy.
05Dt 6:1 "These are the commands, decrees, and regulations that the LORD your God commanded me to teach you. You must obey them in the land you are about to enter and occupy,
05Dt 6:2 and you and your children and grandchildren must fear the LORD your God as long as you live. If you obey all his decrees and commands, you will enjoy a long life.
05Dt 6:3 Listen closely, Israel, and be careful to obey. Then all will go well with you, and you will have many children in the land flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your ancestors, promised you.
05Dt 6:4 "Listen, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD alone¨ç. / ¨ç{Or The LORD our God is one LORD; or The LORD our God, the LORD is one; or The LORD is our God, the LORD is one}
05Dt 6:5 And you must love the LORD your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength.
05Dt 6:6 And you must commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these commands that I am giving you today.
05Dt 6:7 Repeat them again and again to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and when you are on the road, when you are going to bed and when you are getting up.
05Dt 6:8 Tie them to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders.
05Dt 6:9 Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.
05Dt 6:10 "The LORD your God will soon bring you into the land he swore to give you when he made a vow to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. It is a land with large, prosperous cities that you did not build.
05Dt 6:11 The houses will be richly stocked with goods you did not produce. You will draw water from cisterns you did not dig, and you will eat from vineyards and olive trees you did not plant. When you have eaten your fill in this land,
05Dt 6:12 be careful not to forget the LORD, who rescued you from slavery in the land of Egypt.
05Dt 6:13 You must fear the LORD your God and serve him. When you take an oath, you must use only his name.
05Dt 6:14 "You must not worship any of the gods of neighboring nations,
05Dt 6:15 for the LORD your God, who lives among you, is a jealous God. His anger will flare up against you, and he will wipe you from the face of the earth.
05Dt 6:16 You must not test the LORD your God as you did when you complained at Massah.
05Dt 6:17 You must diligently obey the commands of the LORD your God - all the laws and decrees he has given you.
05Dt 6:18 Do what is right and good in the LORD's sight, so all will go well with you. Then you will enter and occupy the good land that the LORD swore to give your ancestors.
05Dt 6:19 You will drive out all the enemies living in the land, just as the LORD said you would.
05Dt 6:20 "In the future your children will ask you, 'What is the meaning of these laws, decrees, and regulations that the LORD our God has commanded us to obey?'
05Dt 6:21 "Then you must tell them, 'We were Pharaoh's slaves in Egypt, but the LORD brought us out of Egypt with his strong hand.
05Dt 6:22 The LORD did miraculous signs and wonders before our eyes, dealing terrifying blows against Egypt and Pharaoh and all his people.
05Dt 6:23 He brought us out of Egypt so he could give us this land he had sworn to give our ancestors.
05Dt 6:24 And the LORD our God commanded us to obey all these decrees and to fear him so he can continue to bless us and preserve our lives, as he has done to this day.
05Dt 6:25 For we will be counted as righteous when we obey all the commands the LORD our God has given us.'
05Dt 7:1 "When the LORD your God brings you into the land you are about to enter and occupy, he will clear away many nations ahead of you£º the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites. These seven nations are greater and more numerous than you.
05Dt 7:2 When the LORD your God hands these nations over to you and you conquer them, you must completely destroy¨ç them. Make no treaties with them and show them no mercy.
05Dt 7:3 You must not intermarry with them. Do not let your daughters and sons marry their sons and daughters, / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; also in 7.26}
05Dt 7:4 for they will lead your children away from me to worship other gods. Then the anger of the LORD will burn against you, and he will quickly destroy you.
05Dt 7:5 This is what you must do. You must break down their pagan altars and shatter their sacred pillars. Cut down their Asherah poles and burn their idols.
05Dt 7:6 For you are a holy people, who belong to the LORD your God. Of all the people on earth, the LORD your God has chosen you to be his own special treasure.
05Dt 7:7 "The LORD did not set his heart on you and choose you because you were more numerous than other nations, for you were the smallest of all nations!
05Dt 7:8 Rather, it was simply that the LORD loves you, and he was keeping the oath he had sworn to your ancestors. That is why the LORD rescued you with such a strong hand from your slavery and from the oppressive hand of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
05Dt 7:9 Understand, therefore, that the LORD your God is indeed God. He is the faithful God who keeps his covenant for a thousand generations and lavishes his unfailing love on those who love him and obey his commands.
05Dt 7:10 But he does not hesitate to punish and destroy those who reject him.
05Dt 7:11 Therefore, you must obey all these commands, decrees, and regulations I am giving you today.
05Dt 7:12 "If you listen to these regulations and faithfully obey them, the LORD your God will keep his covenant of unfailing love with you, as he promised with an oath to your ancestors.
05Dt 7:13 He will love you and bless you, and he will give you many children. He will give fertility to your land and your animals. When you arrive in the land he swore to give your ancestors, you will have large harvests of grain, new wine, and olive oil, and great herds of cattle, sheep, and goats.
05Dt 7:14 You will be blessed above all the nations of the earth. None of your men or women will be childless, and all your livestock will bear young.
05Dt 7:15 And the LORD will protect you from all sickness. He will not let you suffer from the terrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but he will inflict them on all your enemies!
05Dt 7:16 "You must destroy all the nations the LORD your God hands over to you. Show them no mercy, and do not worship their gods, or they will trap you.
05Dt 7:17 Perhaps you will think to yourselves, 'How can we ever conquer these nations that are so much more powerful than we are?'
05Dt 7:18 But don't be afraid of them! Just remember what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all the land of Egypt.
05Dt 7:19 Remember the great terrors the LORD your God sent against them. You saw it all with your own eyes! And remember the miraculous signs and wonders, and the strong hand and powerful arm with which he brought you out of Egypt. The LORD your God will use this same power against all the people you fear.
05Dt 7:20 And then the LORD your God will send terror¨ç to drive out the few survivors still hiding from you! / ¨ç{Often rendered the hornet. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
05Dt 7:21 "No, do not be afraid of those nations, for the LORD your God is among you, and he is a great and awesome God.
05Dt 7:22 The LORD your God will drive those nations out ahead of you little by little. You will not clear them away all at once, otherwise the wild animals would multiply too quickly for you.
05Dt 7:23 But the LORD your God will hand them over to you. He will throw them into complete confusion until they are destroyed.
05Dt 7:24 He will put their kings in your power, and you will erase their names from the face of the earth. No one will be able to stand against you, and you will destroy them all.
05Dt 7:25 "You must burn their idols in fire, and you must not covet the silver or gold that covers them. You must not take it or it will become a trap to you, for it is detestable to the LORD your God.
05Dt 7:26 Do not bring any detestable objects into your home, for then you will be destroyed, just like them. You must utterly detest such things, for they are set apart for destruction.
05Dt 8:1 "Be careful to obey all the commands I am giving you today. Then you will live and multiply, and you will enter and occupy the land the LORD swore to give your ancestors.
05Dt 8:2 Remember how the LORD your God led you through the wilderness for these forty years, humbling you and testing you to prove your character, and to find out whether or not you would obey his commands.
05Dt 8:3 Yes, he humbled you by letting you go hungry and then feeding you with manna, a food previously unknown to you and your ancestors. He did it to teach you that people do not live by bread alone; rather, we live by every word that comes from the mouth of the LORD.
05Dt 8:4 For all these forty years your clothes didn't wear out, and your feet didn't blister or swell.
05Dt 8:5 Think about it£º Just as a parent disciplines a child, the LORD your God disciplines you for your own good.
05Dt 8:6 "So obey the commands of the LORD your God by walking in his ways and fearing him.
05Dt 8:7 For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land of flowing streams and pools of water, with fountains and springs that gush out in the valleys and hills.
05Dt 8:8 It is a land of wheat and barley; of grapevines, fig trees, and pomegranates; of olive oil and honey.
05Dt 8:9 It is a land where food is plentiful and nothing is lacking. It is a land where iron is as common as stone, and copper is abundant in the hills.
05Dt 8:10 When you have eaten your fill, be sure to praise the LORD your God for the good land he has given you.
05Dt 8:11 "But that is the time to be careful! Beware that in your plenty you do not forget the LORD your God and disobey his commands, regulations, and decrees that I am giving you today.
05Dt 8:12 For when you have become full and prosperous and have built fine homes to live in,
05Dt 8:13 and when your flocks and herds have become very large and your silver and gold have multiplied along with everything else, be careful!
05Dt 8:14 Do not become proud at that time and forget the LORD your God, who rescued you from slavery in the land of Egypt.
05Dt 8:15 Do not forget that he led you through the great and terrifying wilderness with its poisonous snakes and scorpions, where it was so hot and dry. He gave you water from the rock!
05Dt 8:16 He fed you with manna in the wilderness, a food unknown to your ancestors. He did this to humble you and test you for your own good.
05Dt 8:17 He did all this so you would never say to yourself, 'I have achieved this wealth with my own strength and energy.'
05Dt 8:18 Remember the LORD your God. He is the one who gives you power to be successful, in order to fulfill the covenant he confirmed to your ancestors with an oath.
05Dt 8:19 "But I assure you of this£º If you ever forget the LORD your God and follow other gods, worshiping and bowing down to them, you will certainly be destroyed.
05Dt 8:20 Just as the LORD has destroyed other nations in your path, you also will be destroyed if you refuse to obey the LORD your God.
05Dt 9:1 "Listen, O Israel! Today you are about to cross the Jordan River to take over the land belonging to nations much greater and more powerful than you. They live in cities with walls that reach to the sky!
05Dt 9:2 The people are strong and tall - descendants of the famous Anakite giants. You've heard the saying, 'Who can stand up to the Anakites?'
05Dt 9:3 But recognize today that the LORD your God is the one who will cross over ahead of you like a devouring fire to destroy them. He will subdue them so that you will quickly conquer them and drive them out, just as the LORD has promised.
05Dt 9:4 "After the LORD your God has done this for you, don't say in your hearts, 'The LORD has given us this land because we are such good people!' No, it is because of the wickedness of the other nations that he is pushing them out of your way.
05Dt 9:5 It is not because you are so good or have such integrity that you are about to occupy their land. The LORD your God will drive these nations out ahead of you only because of their wickedness, and to fulfill the oath he swore to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
05Dt 9:6 You must recognize that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land because you are good, for you are not - you are a stubborn people.
05Dt 9:7 "Remember and never forget how angry you made the LORD your God out in the wilderness. From the day you left Egypt until now, you have been constantly rebelling against him.
05Dt 9:8 Even at Mount Sinai¨ç you made the LORD so angry he was ready to destroy you. / ¨ç{Hebrew Horeb, another name for Sinai}
05Dt 9:9 This happened when I was on the mountain receiving the tablets of stone inscribed with the words of the covenant that the LORD had made with you. I was there for forty days and forty nights, and all that time I ate no food and drank no water.
05Dt 9:10 The LORD gave me the two tablets on which God had written with his own finger all the words he had spoken to you from the heart of the fire when you were assembled at the mountain.
05Dt 9:11 "At the end of the forty days and nights, the LORD handed me the two stone tablets inscribed with the words of the covenant.
05Dt 9:12 Then the LORD said to me, 'Get up! Go down immediately, for the people you brought out of Egypt have corrupted themselves. How quickly they have turned away from the way I commanded them to live! They have melted gold and made an idol for themselves!'
05Dt 9:13 "The LORD also said to me, 'I have seen how stubborn and rebellious these people are.
05Dt 9:14 Leave me alone so I may destroy them and erase their name from under heaven. Then I will make a mighty nation of your descendants, a nation larger and more powerful than they are.'
05Dt 9:15 "So while the mountain was blazing with fire I turned and came down, holding in my hands the two stone tablets inscribed with the terms of the covenant.
05Dt 9:16 There below me I could see that you had sinned against the LORD your God. You had melted gold and made a calf idol for yourselves. How quickly you had turned away from the path the LORD had commanded you to follow!
05Dt 9:17 So I took the stone tablets and threw them to the ground, smashing them before your eyes.
05Dt 9:18 "Then, as before, I threw myself down before the LORD for forty days and nights. I ate no bread and drank no water because of the great sin you had committed by doing what the LORD hated, provoking him to anger.
05Dt 9:19 I feared that the furious anger of the LORD, which turned him against you, would drive him to destroy you. But again he listened to me.
05Dt 9:20 The LORD was so angry with Aaron that he wanted to destroy him, too. But I prayed for Aaron, and the LORD spared him.
05Dt 9:21 I took your sin - the calf you had made - and I melted it down in the fire and ground it into fine dust. Then I threw the dust into the stream that flows down the mountain.
05Dt 9:22 "You also made the LORD angry at Taberah¨ç, Massah¨è, and Kibroth-hattaavah¨é. / ¨ç{Taberah means "place of burning." See Num 11.1-3} ¨è{Massah means "place of testing." See Exod 17.1-7} ¨é{Kibroth-hattaavah means "graves of gluttony." See Num 11.31-34}
05Dt 9:23 And at Kadesh-barnea the LORD sent you out with this command£º 'Go up and take over the land I have given you.' But you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God and refused to put your trust in him or obey him.
05Dt 9:24 Yes, you have been rebelling against the LORD as long as I have known you.
05Dt 9:25 "That is why I threw myself down before the LORD for forty days and nights - for the LORD said he would destroy you.
05Dt 9:26 I prayed to the LORD and said, 'O Sovereign LORD, do not destroy them. They are your own people. They are your special possession, whom you redeemed from Egypt by your mighty power and your strong hand.
05Dt 9:27 Please overlook the stubbornness and the awful sin of these people, and remember instead your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
05Dt 9:28 If you destroy these people, the Egyptians will say, "The Israelites died because the LORD wasn't able to bring them to the land he had promised to give them." Or they might say, "He destroyed them because he hated them; he deliberately took them into the wilderness to slaughter them."
05Dt 9:29 But they are your people and your special possession, whom you brought out of Egypt by your great strength and powerful arm.'
05Dt 10:1 "At that time the LORD said to me, 'Chisel out two stone tablets like the first ones. Also make a wooden Ark - a sacred chest to store them in. Come up to me on the mountain,
05Dt 10:2 and I will write on the tablets the same words that were on the ones you smashed. Then place the tablets in the Ark.'
05Dt 10:3 "So I made an Ark of acacia wood and cut two stone tablets like the first two. Then I went up the mountain with the tablets in my hand.
05Dt 10:4 Once again the LORD wrote the Ten Commandments¨ç on the tablets and gave them to me. They were the same words the LORD had spoken to you from the heart of the fire on the day you were assembled at the foot of the mountain. / ¨ç{Hebrew the ten words}
05Dt 10:5 Then I turned and came down the mountain and placed the tablets in the Ark of the Covenant, which I had made, just as the LORD commanded me. And the tablets are still there in the Ark."
05Dt 10:6 (The people of Israel set out from the wells of the people of Jaakan¨ç and traveled to Moserah, where Aaron died and was buried. His son Eleazar ministered as high priest in his place. / ¨ç{Or set out from Beeroth of Bene-jaakan}
05Dt 10:7 Then they journeyed to Gudgodah, and from there to Jotbathah, a land with many brooks and streams.
05Dt 10:8 At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the Ark of the LORD's Covenant, and to stand before the LORD as his ministers, and to pronounce blessings in his name. These are their duties to this day.
05Dt 10:9 That is why the Levites have no share of property or possession of land among the other Israelite tribes. The LORD himself is their special possession, as the LORD your God told them.)
05Dt 10:10 "As for me, I stayed on the mountain in the LORD's presence for forty days and nights, as I had done the first time. And once again the LORD listened to my pleas and agreed not to destroy you.
05Dt 10:11 Then the LORD said to me, 'Get up and resume the journey, and lead the people to the land I swore to give to their ancestors, so they may take possession of it.'
05Dt 10:12 "And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require of you? He requires only that you fear the LORD your God, and live in a way that pleases him, and love him and serve him with all your heart and soul.
05Dt 10:13 And you must always obey the LORD's commands and decrees that I am giving you today for your own good.
05Dt 10:14 "Look, the highest heavens and the earth and everything in it all belong to the LORD your God.
05Dt 10:15 Yet the LORD chose your ancestors as the objects of his love. And he chose you, their descendants, above all other nations, as is evident today.
05Dt 10:16 Therefore, change your hearts¨ç and stop being stubborn. / ¨ç{Hebrew circumcise the foreskin of your hearts}
05Dt 10:17 "For the LORD your God is the God of gods and Lord of lords. He is the great God, the mighty and awesome God, who shows no partiality and cannot be bribed.
05Dt 10:18 He ensures that orphans and widows receive justice. He shows love to the foreigners living among you and gives them food and clothing.
05Dt 10:19 So you, too, must show love to foreigners, for you yourselves were once foreigners in the land of Egypt.
05Dt 10:20 You must fear the LORD your God and worship him and cling to him. Your oaths must be in his name alone.
05Dt 10:21 He alone is your God, the only one who is worthy of your praise, the one who has done these mighty miracles that you have seen with your own eyes.
05Dt 10:22 When your ancestors went down into Egypt, there were only seventy of them. But now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars in the sky!
05Dt 11:1 "You must love the LORD your God and obey all his requirements, decrees, regulations, and commands.
05Dt 11:2 Keep in mind that I am not talking now to your children, who have never experienced the discipline of the LORD your God or seen his greatness and his strong hand and powerful arm.
05Dt 11:3 They didn't see the miraculous signs and wonders he performed in Egypt against Pharaoh and all his land.
05Dt 11:4 They didn't see what the LORD did to the armies of Egypt and to their horses and chariots - how he drowned them in the Red Sea¨ç as they were chasing you. He destroyed them, and they have not recovered to this very day! / ¨ç{Hebrew sea of reeds}
05Dt 11:5 "Your children didn't see how the LORD cared for you in the wilderness until you arrived here.
05Dt 11:6 They didn't see what he did to Dathan and Abiram (the sons of Eliab, a descendant of Reuben) when the earth opened its mouth in the Israelite camp and swallowed them, along with their households and tents and every living thing that belonged to them.
05Dt 11:7 But you have seen the LORD perform all these mighty deeds with your own eyes!
05Dt 11:8 "Therefore, be careful to obey every command I am giving you today, so you may have strength to go in and take over the land you are about to enter.
05Dt 11:9 If you obey, you will enjoy a long life in the land the LORD swore to give to your ancestors and to you, their descendants - a land flowing with milk and honey!
05Dt 11:10 For the land you are about to enter and take over is not like the land of Egypt from which you came, where you planted your seed and made irrigation ditches with your foot as in a vegetable garden.
05Dt 11:11 Rather, the land you will soon take over is a land of hills and valleys with plenty of rain - 
05Dt 11:12 a land that the LORD your God cares for. He watches over it through each season of the year!
05Dt 11:13 "If you carefully obey all the commands I am giving you today, and if you love the LORD your God and serve him with all your heart and soul,
05Dt 11:14 then he will send the rains in their proper seasons - the early and late rains - so you can bring in your harvests of grain, new wine, and olive oil.
05Dt 11:15 He will give you lush pastureland for your livestock, and you yourselves will have all you want to eat.
05Dt 11:16 "But be careful. Don't let your heart be deceived so that you turn away from the LORD and serve and worship other gods.
05Dt 11:17 If you do, the LORD's anger will burn against you. He will shut up the sky and hold back the rain, and the ground will fail to produce its harvests. Then you will quickly die in that good land the LORD is giving you.
05Dt 11:18 "So commit yourselves wholeheartedly to these words of mine. Tie them to your hands and wear them on your forehead as reminders.
05Dt 11:19 Teach them to your children. Talk about them when you are at home and when you are on the road, when you are going to bed and when you are getting up.
05Dt 11:20 Write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates,
05Dt 11:21 so that as long as the sky remains above the earth, you and your children may flourish in the land the LORD swore to give your ancestors.
05Dt 11:22 "Be careful to obey all these commands I am giving you. Show love to the LORD your God by walking in his ways and holding tightly to him.
05Dt 11:23 Then the LORD will drive out all the nations ahead of you, though they are much greater and stronger than you, and you will take over their land.
05Dt 11:24 Wherever you set foot, that land will be yours. Your frontiers will stretch from the wilderness in the south to Lebanon in the north, and from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea in the west¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew to the western sea}
05Dt 11:25 No one will be able to stand against you, for the LORD your God will cause the people to fear and dread you, as he promised, wherever you go in the whole land.
05Dt 11:26 "Look, today I am giving you the choice between a blessing and a curse!
05Dt 11:27 You will be blessed if you obey the commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you today.
05Dt 11:28 But you will be cursed if you reject the commands of the LORD your God and turn away from him and worship gods you have not known before.
05Dt 11:29 "When the LORD your God brings you into the land and helps you take possession of it, you must pronounce the blessing at Mount Gerizim and the curse at Mount Ebal.

05Dt 11:32 you must be careful to obey all the decrees and regulations I am giving you today.
05Dt 12:1 "These are the decrees and regulations you must be careful to obey when you live in the land that the LORD, the God of your ancestors, is giving you. You must obey them as long as you live.
05Dt 12:2 "When you drive out the nations that live there, you must destroy all the places where they worship their gods - high on the mountains, up on the hills, and under every green tree.
05Dt 12:3 Break down their altars and smash their sacred pillars. Burn their Asherah poles and cut down their carved idols. Completely erase the names of their gods!
05Dt 12:4 "Do not worship the LORD your God in the way these pagan peoples worship their gods.
05Dt 12:5 Rather, you must seek the LORD your God at the place of worship he himself will choose from among all the tribes - the place where his name will be honored.
05Dt 12:6 There you will bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, your sacred offerings, your offerings to fulfill a vow, your voluntary offerings, and your offerings of the firstborn animals of your herds and flocks.
05Dt 12:7 There you and your families will feast in the presence of the LORD your God, and you will rejoice in all you have accomplished because the LORD your God has blessed you.
05Dt 12:8 "Your pattern of worship will change. Today all of you are doing as you please,
05Dt 12:9 because you have not yet arrived at the place of rest, the land the LORD your God is giving you as your special possession.
05Dt 12:10 But you will soon cross the Jordan River and live in the land the LORD your God is giving you. When he gives you rest from all your enemies and you're living safely in the land,
05Dt 12:11 you must bring everything I command you - your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, your sacred offerings, and your offerings to fulfill a vow - to the designated place of worship, the place the LORD your God chooses for his name to be honored.
05Dt 12:12 "You must celebrate there in the presence of the LORD your God with your sons and daughters and all your servants. And remember to include the Levites who live in your towns, for they will receive no allotment of land among you.
05Dt 12:13 Be careful not to sacrifice your burnt offerings just anywhere you like.
05Dt 12:14 You may do so only at the place the LORD will choose within one of your tribal territories. There you must offer your burnt offerings and do everything I command you.
05Dt 12:15 "But you may butcher your animals and eat their meat in any town whenever you want. You may freely eat the animals with which the LORD your God blesses you. All of you, whether ceremonially clean or unclean, may eat that meat, just as you now eat gazelle and deer.
05Dt 12:16 But you must not consume the blood. You must pour it out on the ground like water.
05Dt 12:17 "But you may not eat your offerings in your hometown - neither the tithe of your grain and new wine and olive oil, nor the firstborn of your flocks and herds, nor any offering to fulfill a vow, nor your voluntary offerings, nor your sacred offerings.
05Dt 12:18 You must eat these in the presence of the LORD your God at the place he will choose. Eat them there with your children, your servants, and the Levites who live in your towns, celebrating in the presence of the LORD your God in all you do.
05Dt 12:19 And be very careful never to neglect the Levites as long as you live in your land.
05Dt 12:20 "When the LORD your God expands your territory as he has promised, and you have the urge to eat meat, you may freely eat meat whenever you want.
05Dt 12:21 It might happen that the designated place of worship - the place the LORD your God chooses for his name to be honored - is a long way from your home. If so, you may butcher any of the cattle, sheep, or goats the LORD has given you, and you may freely eat the meat in your hometown, as I have commanded you.
05Dt 12:22 Anyone, whether ceremonially clean or unclean, may eat that meat, just as you do now with gazelle and deer.
05Dt 12:23 But never consume the blood, for the blood is the life, and you must not consume the lifeblood with the meat.
05Dt 12:24 Instead, pour out the blood on the ground like water.
05Dt 12:25 Do not consume the blood, so that all may go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what pleases the LORD.
05Dt 12:26 "Take your sacred gifts and your offerings given to fulfill a vow to the place the LORD chooses.
05Dt 12:27 You must offer the meat and blood of your burnt offerings on the altar of the LORD your God. The blood of your other sacrifices must be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God, but you may eat the meat.
05Dt 12:28 Be careful to obey all my commands, so that all will go well with you and your children after you, because you will be doing what is good and pleasing to the LORD your God.
05Dt 12:29 "When the LORD your God goes ahead of you and destroys the nations and you drive them out and live in their land,
05Dt 12:30 do not fall into the trap of following their customs and worshiping their gods. Do not inquire about their gods, saying, 'How do these nations worship their gods? I want to follow their example.'
05Dt 12:31 You must not worship the LORD your God the way the other nations worship their gods, for they perform for their gods every detestable act that the LORD hates. They even burn their sons and daughters as sacrifices to their gods.
05Dt 12:32 ¨ç"So be careful to obey all the commands I give you. You must not add anything to them or subtract anything from them. / ¨ç{Verse 12.32 is numbered 13.1 in Hebrew text}
05Dt 13:1 ¨ç"Suppose there are prophets among you or those who dream dreams about the future, and they promise you signs or miracles, / ¨ç{Verses 13.1-18 are numbered 13.2-19 in Hebrew text}
05Dt 13:2 and the predicted signs or miracles occur. If they then say, 'Come, let us worship other gods' - gods you have not known before - 
05Dt 13:3 do not listen to them. The LORD your God is testing you to see if you truly love him with all your heart and soul.
05Dt 13:4 Serve only the LORD your God and fear him alone. Obey his commands, listen to his voice, and cling to him.
05Dt 13:5 The false prophets or visionaries who try to lead you astray must be put to death, for they encourage rebellion against the LORD your God, who redeemed you from slavery and brought you out of the land of Egypt. Since they try to lead you astray from the way the LORD your God commanded you to live, you must put them to death. In this way you will purge the evil from among you.
05Dt 13:6 "Suppose someone secretly entices you - even your brother, your son or daughter, your beloved wife, or your closest friend - and says, 'Let us go worship other gods' - gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known.
05Dt 13:7 They might suggest that you worship the gods of peoples who live nearby or who come from the ends of the earth.
05Dt 13:8 But do not give in or listen. Have no pity, and do not spare or protect them.
05Dt 13:9 You must put them to death! Strike the first blow yourself, and then all the people must join in.
05Dt 13:10 Stone the guilty ones to death because they have tried to draw you away from the LORD your God, who rescued you from the land of Egypt, the place of slavery.
05Dt 13:11 Then all Israel will hear about it and be afraid, and no one will act so wickedly again.
05Dt 13:12 "When you begin living in the towns the LORD your God is giving you, you may hear
05Dt 13:13 that scoundrels among you are leading their fellow citizens astray by saying, 'Let us go worship other gods' - gods you have not known before.
05Dt 13:14 In such cases, you must examine the facts carefully. If you find that the report is true and such a detestable act has been committed among you,
05Dt 13:15 you must attack that town and completely destroy¨ç all its inhabitants, as well as all the livestock. / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; similarly in 13.17}
05Dt 13:16 Then you must pile all the plunder in the middle of the open square and burn it. Burn the entire town as a burnt offering to the LORD your God. That town must remain a ruin forever; it may never be rebuilt.
05Dt 13:17 Keep none of the plunder that has been set apart for destruction. Then the LORD will turn from his fierce anger and be merciful to you. He will have compassion on you and make you a large nation, just as he swore to your ancestors.
05Dt 13:18 "The LORD your God will be merciful only if you listen to his voice and keep all his commands that I am giving you today, doing what pleases him.
05Dt 14:1 "Since you are the people of the LORD your God, never cut yourselves or shave the hair above your foreheads in mourning for the dead.
05Dt 14:2 You have been set apart as holy to the LORD your God, and he has chosen you from all the nations of the earth to be his own special treasure.
05Dt 14:3 "You must not eat any detestable animals that are ceremonially unclean.
05Dt 14:4 These are the animals¨ç you may eat£º the ox, the sheep, the goat, / ¨ç{The identification of some of the animals and birds listed in this chapter is uncertain}
05Dt 14:5 the deer, the gazelle, the roe deer, the wild goat, the addax, the antelope, and the mountain sheep.
05Dt 14:6 "You may eat any animal that has completely split hooves and chews the cud,
05Dt 14:7 but if the animal doesn't have both, it may not be eaten. So you may not eat the camel, the hare, or the hyrax¨ç. They chew the cud but do not have split hooves, so they are ceremonially unclean for you. / ¨ç{Or coney, or rock badger}
05Dt 14:8 And you may not eat the pig. It has split hooves but does not chew the cud, so it is ceremonially unclean for you. You may not eat the meat of these animals or even touch their carcasses.
05Dt 14:9 "Of all the marine animals, you may eat whatever has both fins and scales.
05Dt 14:10 You may not, however, eat marine animals that do not have both fins and scales. They are ceremonially unclean for you.
05Dt 14:11 "You may eat any bird that is ceremonially clean.
05Dt 14:12 These are the birds you may not eat£º the griffon vulture, the bearded vulture, the black vulture,
05Dt 14:13 the kite, the falcon, buzzards of all kinds,
05Dt 14:14 ravens of all kinds,
05Dt 14:15 the eagle owl, the short-eared owl, the seagull, hawks of all kinds,
05Dt 14:16 the little owl, the great owl, the barn owl,
05Dt 14:17 the desert owl, the Egyptian vulture, the cormorant,
05Dt 14:18 the stork, herons of all kinds, the hoopoe, and the bat.
05Dt 14:19 "All winged insects that walk along the ground are ceremonially unclean for you and may not be eaten.
05Dt 14:20 But you may eat any winged bird or insect that is ceremonially clean.
05Dt 14:21 "You must not eat anything that has died a natural death. You may give it to a foreigner living in your town, or you may sell it to a stranger. But do not eat it yourselves, for you are set apart as holy to the LORD your God. "You must not cook a young goat in its mother's milk.
05Dt 14:22 "You must set aside a tithe of your crops - one-tenth of all the crops you harvest each year.
05Dt 14:23 Bring this tithe to the designated place of worship - the place the LORD your God chooses for his name to be honored - and eat it there in his presence. This applies to your tithes of grain, new wine, olive oil, and the firstborn males of your flocks and herds. Doing this will teach you always to fear the LORD your God.
05Dt 14:24 "Now when the LORD your God blesses you with a good harvest, the place of worship he chooses for his name to be honored might be too far for you to bring the tithe.
05Dt 14:25 If so, you may sell the tithe portion of your crops and herds, put the money in a pouch, and go to the place the LORD your God has chosen.
05Dt 14:26 When you arrive, you may use the money to buy any kind of food you want - cattle, sheep, goats, wine, or other alcoholic drink. Then feast there in the presence of the LORD your God and celebrate with your household.
05Dt 14:27 And do not neglect the Levites in your town, for they will receive no allotment of land among you.
05Dt 14:28 "At the end of every third year, bring the entire tithe of that year's harvest and store it in the nearest town.
05Dt 14:29 Give it to the Levites, who will receive no allotment of land among you, as well as to the foreigners living among you, the orphans, and the widows in your towns, so they can eat and be satisfied. Then the LORD your God will bless you in all your work.
05Dt 15:1 "At the end of every seventh year you must cancel the debts of everyone who owes you money.
05Dt 15:2 This is how it must be done. Everyone must cancel the loans they have made to their fellow Israelites. They must not demand payment from their neighbors or relatives, for the LORD's time of release has arrived.
05Dt 15:3 This release from debt, however, applies only to your fellow Israelites - not to the foreigners living among you.
05Dt 15:4 "There should be no poor among you, for the LORD your God will greatly bless you in the land he is giving you as a special possession.
05Dt 15:5 You will receive this blessing if you are careful to obey all the commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you today.
05Dt 15:6 The LORD your God will bless you as he has promised. You will lend money to many nations but will never need to borrow. You will rule many nations, but they will not rule over you.
05Dt 15:7 "But if there are any poor Israelites in your towns when you arrive in the land the LORD your God is giving you, do not be hard-hearted or tightfisted toward them.
05Dt 15:8 Instead, be generous and lend them whatever they need.
05Dt 15:9 Do not be mean-spirited and refuse someone a loan because the year for canceling debts is close at hand. If you refuse to make the loan and the needy person cries out to the LORD, you will be considered guilty of sin.
05Dt 15:10 Give generously to the poor, not grudgingly, for the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do.
05Dt 15:11 There will always be some in the land who are poor. That is why I am commanding you to share freely with the poor and with other Israelites in need.
05Dt 15:12 "If a fellow Hebrew sells himself or herself to be your servant¨ç and serves you for six years, in the seventh year you must set that servant free. / ¨ç{Or If a Hebrew man or woman is sold to you}
05Dt 15:13 "When you release a male servant, do not send him away empty-handed.
05Dt 15:14 Give him a generous farewell gift from your flock, your threshing floor, and your winepress. Share with him some of the bounty with which the LORD your God has blessed you.
05Dt 15:15 Remember that you were once slaves in the land of Egypt and the LORD your God redeemed you! That is why I am giving you this command.
05Dt 15:16 "But suppose your servant says, 'I will not leave you,' because he loves you and your family, and he has done well with you.
05Dt 15:17 In that case, take an awl and push it through his earlobe into the door. After that, he will be your servant for life. And do the same for your female servants.
05Dt 15:18 "You must not consider it a hardship when you release your servants. Remember that for six years they have given you services worth double the wages of hired workers, and the LORD your God will bless you in all you do.
05Dt 15:19 "You must set aside for the LORD your God all the firstborn males from your flocks and herds. Do not use the firstborn of your herds to work your fields, and do not shear the firstborn of your flocks.
05Dt 15:20 Instead, you and your family must eat these animals in the presence of the LORD your God each year at the place he chooses.
05Dt 15:21 But if this firstborn animal has any defect, such as lameness or blindness, or if anything else is wrong with it, you must not sacrifice it to the LORD your God.
05Dt 15:22 Instead, use it for food for your family in your hometown. Anyone, whether ceremonially clean or unclean, may eat it, just as anyone may eat a gazelle or deer.
05Dt 15:23 But you must not consume the blood. You must pour it out on the ground like water.
05Dt 16:1 "In honor of the LORD your God, celebrate the Passover each year in the early spring, in the month of Abib¨ç, for that was the month in which the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night. / ¨ç{Hebrew Observe the month of Abib, and keep the Passover unto the LORD your God. Abib, the first month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar, usually occurs within the months of March and April}
05Dt 16:2 Your Passover sacrifice may be from either the flock or the herd, and it must be sacrificed to the LORD your God at the designated place of worship - the place he chooses for his name to be honored.
05Dt 16:3 Eat it with bread made without yeast. For seven days the bread you eat must be made without yeast, as when you escaped from Egypt in such a hurry. Eat this bread - the bread of suffering - so that as long as you live you will remember the day you departed from Egypt.
05Dt 16:4 Let no yeast be found in any house throughout your land for those seven days. And when you sacrifice the Passover lamb on the evening of the first day, do not let any of the meat remain until the next morning.
05Dt 16:5 "You may not sacrifice the Passover in just any of the towns that the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 16:6 You must offer it only at the designated place of worship - the place the LORD your God chooses for his name to be honored. Sacrifice it there in the evening as the sun goes down on the anniversary of your exodus from Egypt.
05Dt 16:7 Roast the lamb and eat it in the place the LORD your God chooses. Then you may go back to your tents the next morning.
05Dt 16:8 For the next six days you may not eat any bread made with yeast. On the seventh day proclaim another holy day in honor of the LORD your God, and no work may be done on that day.
05Dt 16:9 "Count off seven weeks from when you first begin to cut the grain at the time of harvest.
05Dt 16:10 Then celebrate the Festival of Harvest¨ç to honor the LORD your God. Bring him a voluntary offering in proportion to the blessings you have received from him. / ¨ç{Hebrew Festival of Weeks; also in 16.16. This was later called the Festival of Pentecost (see Acts 2.1). It is celebrated today as Shavuat (or Shabuoth)}
05Dt 16:11 This is a time to celebrate before the LORD your God at the designated place of worship he will choose for his name to be honored. Celebrate with your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, the Levites from your towns, and the foreigners, orphans, and widows who live among you.
05Dt 16:12 Remember that you were once slaves in Egypt, so be careful to obey all these decrees.
05Dt 16:13 "You must observe the Festival of Shelters¨ç for seven days at the end of the harvest season, after the grain has been threshed and the grapes have been pressed. / ¨ç{Or Festival of Booths, or Festival of Tabernacles; also in 16.16. This was earlier called the Festival of the Final Harvest or Festival of Ingathering (see Exod 23.16b). It is celebrated today as Sukkot (or Succoth)}
05Dt 16:14 This festival will be a happy time of celebrating with your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows from your towns.
05Dt 16:15 For seven days you must celebrate this festival to honor the LORD your God at the place he chooses, for it is he who blesses you with bountiful harvests and gives you success in all your work. This festival will be a time of great joy for all.
05Dt 16:16 "Each year every man in Israel must celebrate these three festivals£º the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the Festival of Harvest, and the Festival of Shelters. On each of these occasions, all men must appear before the LORD your God at the place he chooses, but they must not appear before the LORD without a gift for him.
05Dt 16:17 All must give as they are able, according to the blessings given to them by the LORD your God.
05Dt 16:18 "Appoint judges and officials for yourselves from each of your tribes in all the towns the LORD your God is giving you. They must judge the people fairly.
05Dt 16:19 You must never twist justice or show partiality. Never accept a bribe, for bribes blind the eyes of the wise and corrupt the decisions of the godly.
05Dt 16:20 Let true justice prevail, so you may live and occupy the land that the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 16:21 "You must never set up a wooden Asherah pole beside the altar you build for the LORD your God.
05Dt 16:22 And never set up sacred pillars for worship, for the LORD your God hates them.
05Dt 17:1 "Never sacrifice sick or defective cattle, sheep, or goats to the LORD your God, for he detests such gifts.
05Dt 17:2 "When you begin living in the towns the LORD your God is giving you, a man or woman among you might do evil in the sight of the LORD your God and violate the covenant.
05Dt 17:3 For instance, they might serve other gods or worship the sun, the moon, or any of the stars - the forces of heaven - which I have strictly forbidden.
05Dt 17:4 When you hear about it, investigate the matter thoroughly. If it is true that this detestable thing has been done in Israel,
05Dt 17:5 then the man or woman who has committed such an evil act must be taken to the gates of the town and stoned to death.
05Dt 17:6 But never put a person to death on the testimony of only one witness. There must always be two or three witnesses.
05Dt 17:7 The witnesses must throw the first stones, and then all the people may join in. In this way, you will purge the evil from among you.
05Dt 17:8 "Suppose a case arises in a local court that is too hard for you to decide - for instance, whether someone is guilty of murder or only of manslaughter, or a difficult lawsuit, or a case involving different kinds of assault. Take such legal cases to the place the LORD your God will choose,
05Dt 17:9 and present them to the Levitical priests or the judge on duty at that time. They will hear the case and declare the verdict.
05Dt 17:10 You must carry out the verdict they announce and the sentence they prescribe at the place the LORD chooses. You must do exactly what they say.
05Dt 17:11 After they have interpreted the law and declared their verdict, the sentence they impose must be fully executed; do not modify it in any way.
05Dt 17:12 Anyone arrogant enough to reject the verdict of the judge or of the priest who represents the LORD your God must die. In this way you will purge the evil from Israel.
05Dt 17:13 Then everyone else will hear about it and be afraid to act so arrogantly.
05Dt 17:14 "You are about to enter the land the LORD your God is giving you. When you take it over and settle there, you may think, 'We should select a king to rule over us like the other nations around us.'
05Dt 17:15 If this happens, be sure to select as king the man the LORD your God chooses. You must appoint a fellow Israelite; he may not be a foreigner.
05Dt 17:16 "The king must not build up a large stable of horses for himself or send his people to Egypt to buy horses, for the LORD has told you, 'You must never return to Egypt.'
05Dt 17:17 The king must not take many wives for himself, because they will turn his heart away from the LORD. And he must not accumulate large amounts of wealth in silver and gold for himself.
05Dt 17:18 "When he sits on the throne as king, he must copy for himself this body of instruction on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests.
05Dt 17:19 He must always keep that copy with him and read it daily as long as he lives. That way he will learn to fear the LORD his God by obeying all the terms of these instructions and decrees.
05Dt 17:20 This regular reading will prevent him from becoming proud and acting as if he is above his fellow citizens. It will also prevent him from turning away from these commands in the smallest way. And it will ensure that he and his descendants will reign for many generations in Israel.
05Dt 18:1 "Remember that the Levitical priests - that is, the whole of the tribe of Levi - will receive no allotment of land among the other tribes in Israel. Instead, the priests and Levites will eat from the special gifts given to the LORD, for that is their share.
05Dt 18:2 They will have no land of their own among the Israelites. The LORD himself is their special possession, just as he promised them.
05Dt 18:3 "These are the parts the priests may claim as their share from the cattle, sheep, and goats that the people bring as offerings£º the shoulder, the cheeks, and the stomach.
05Dt 18:4 You must also give to the priests the first share of the grain, the new wine, the olive oil, and the wool at shearing time.
05Dt 18:5 For the LORD your God chose the tribe of Levi out of all your tribes to minister in the LORD's name forever.
05Dt 18:6 "Suppose a Levite chooses to move from his town in Israel, wherever he is living, to the place the LORD chooses for worship.
05Dt 18:7 He may minister there in the name of the LORD his God, just like all his fellow Levites who are serving the LORD there.
05Dt 18:8 He may eat his share of the sacrifices and offerings, even if he also receives support from his family.
05Dt 18:9 "When you enter the land the LORD your God is giving you, be very careful not to imitate the detestable customs of the nations living there.
05Dt 18:10 For example, never sacrifice your son or daughter as a burnt offering¨ç. And do not let your people practice fortune-telling, or use sorcery, or interpret omens, or engage in witchcraft, / ¨ç{Or never make your son or daughter pass through the fire}
05Dt 18:11 or cast spells, or function as mediums or psychics, or call forth the spirits of the dead.
05Dt 18:12 Anyone who does these things is detestable to the LORD. It is because the other nations have done these detestable things that the LORD your God will drive them out ahead of you.
05Dt 18:13 But you must be blameless before the LORD your God.
05Dt 18:14 The nations you are about to displace consult sorcerers and fortune-tellers, but the LORD your God forbids you to do such things."
05Dt 18:15 Moses continued, "The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your fellow Israelites. You must listen to him.
05Dt 18:16 For this is what you yourselves requested of the LORD your God when you were assembled at Mount Sinai¨ç. You said, 'Don't let us hear the voice of the LORD our God anymore or see this blazing fire, for we will die.' / ¨ç{Hebrew Horeb, another name for Sinai}
05Dt 18:17 "Then the LORD said to me, 'What they have said is right.
05Dt 18:18 I will raise up a prophet like you from among their fellow Israelites. I will put my words in his mouth, and he will tell the people everything I command him.
05Dt 18:19 I will personally deal with anyone who will not listen to the messages the prophet proclaims on my behalf.
05Dt 18:20 But any prophet who falsely claims to speak in my name or who speaks in the name of another god must die.'
05Dt 18:21 "But you may wonder, 'How will we know whether or not a prophecy is from the LORD?'
05Dt 18:22 If the prophet speaks in the LORD's name but his prediction does not happen or come true, you will know that the LORD did not give that message. That prophet has spoken without my authority and need not be feared.
05Dt 19:1 "When the LORD your God destroys the nations whose land he is giving you, you will take over their land and settle in their towns and homes.
05Dt 19:2 Then you must set apart three cities of refuge in the land the LORD your God is giving you.
05Dt 19:3 Survey the territory¨ç, and divide the land the LORD your God is giving you into three districts, with one of these cities in each district. Then anyone who has killed someone can flee to one of the cities of refuge for safety. / ¨ç{Or Keep the roads in good repair}
05Dt 19:4 "If someone kills another person unintentionally, without previous hostility, the slayer may flee to any of these cities to live in safety.
05Dt 19:5 For example, suppose someone goes into the forest with a neighbor to cut wood. And suppose one of them swings an ax to chop down a tree, and the ax head flies off the handle, killing the other person. In such cases, the slayer may flee to one of the cities of refuge to live in safety.
05Dt 19:6 "If the distance to the nearest city of refuge is too far, an enraged avenger might be able to chase down and kill the person who caused the death. Then the slayer would die unfairly, since he had never shown hostility toward the person who died.
05Dt 19:7 That is why I am commanding you to set aside three cities of refuge.
05Dt 19:8 "And if the LORD your God enlarges your territory, as he swore to your ancestors, and gives you all the land he promised them,
05Dt 19:9 you must designate three additional cities of refuge. (He will give you this land if you are careful to obey all the commands I have given you - if you always love the LORD your God and walk in his ways.)
05Dt 19:10 That way you will prevent the death of innocent people in the land the LORD your God is giving you as your special possession. You will not be held responsible for the death of innocent people.
05Dt 19:11 "But suppose someone is hostile toward a neighbor and deliberately ambushes and murders him and then flees to one of the cities of refuge.
05Dt 19:12 In that case, the elders of the murderer's hometown must send agents to the city of refuge to bring him back and hand him over to the dead person's avenger to be put to death.
05Dt 19:13 Do not feel sorry for that murderer! Purge from Israel the guilt of murdering innocent people; then all will go well with you.
05Dt 19:14 "When you arrive in the land the LORD your God is giving you as your special possession, you must never steal anyone's land by moving the boundary markers your ancestors set up to mark their property.
05Dt 19:15 "You must not convict anyone of a crime on the testimony of only one witness. The facts of the case must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.
05Dt 19:16 "If a malicious witness comes forward and accuses someone of a crime,
05Dt 19:17 then both the accuser and accused must appear before the LORD by coming to the priests and judges in office at that time.
05Dt 19:18 The judges must investigate the case thoroughly. If the accuser has brought false charges against his fellow Israelite,
05Dt 19:19 you must impose on the accuser the sentence he intended for the other person. In this way, you will purge such evil from among you.
05Dt 19:20 Then the rest of the people will hear about it and be afraid to do such an evil thing.
05Dt 19:21 You must show no pity for the guilty! Your rule should be life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.
05Dt 20:1 "When you go out to fight your enemies and you face horses and chariots and an army greater than your own, do not be afraid. The LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, is with you!
05Dt 20:2 When you prepare for battle, the priest must come forward to speak to the troops.
05Dt 20:3 He will say to them, 'Listen to me, all you men of Israel! Do not be afraid as you go out to fight your enemies today! Do not lose heart or panic or tremble before them.
05Dt 20:4 For the LORD your God is going with you! He will fight for you against your enemies, and he will give you victory!'
05Dt 20:5 "Then the officers of the army must address the troops and say, 'Has anyone here just built a new house but not yet dedicated it? If so, you may go home! You might be killed in the battle, and someone else would dedicate your house.
05Dt 20:6 Has anyone here just planted a vineyard but not yet eaten any of its fruit? If so, you may go home! You might die in battle, and someone else would eat the first fruit.
05Dt 20:7 Has anyone here just become engaged to a woman but not yet married her? Well, you may go home and get married! You might die in the battle, and someone else would marry her.'
05Dt 20:8 "Then the officers will also say, 'Is anyone here afraid or worried? If you are, you may go home before you frighten anyone else.'
05Dt 20:9 When the officers have finished speaking to their troops, they will appoint the unit commanders.
05Dt 20:10 "As you approach a town to attack it, you must first offer its people terms for peace.
05Dt 20:11 If they accept your terms and open the gates to you, then all the people inside will serve you in forced labor.
05Dt 20:12 But if they refuse to make peace and prepare to fight, you must attack the town.
05Dt 20:13 When the LORD your God hands the town over to you, use your swords to kill every man in the town.
05Dt 20:14 But you may keep for yourselves all the women, children, livestock, and other plunder. You may enjoy the plunder from your enemies that the LORD your God has given you.
05Dt 20:15 "But these instructions apply only to distant towns, not to the towns of the nations in the land you will enter.
05Dt 20:16 In those towns that the LORD your God is giving you as a special possession, destroy every living thing.
05Dt 20:17 You must completely destroy¨ç the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, just as the LORD your God has commanded you. / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering}
05Dt 20:18 This will prevent the people of the land from teaching you to imitate their detestable customs in the worship of their gods, which would cause you to sin deeply against the LORD your God.
05Dt 20:19 "When you are attacking a town and the war drags on, you must not cut down the trees with your axes. You may eat the fruit, but do not cut down the trees. Are the trees your enemies, that you should attack them?
05Dt 20:20 You may only cut down trees that you know are not valuable for food. Use them to make the equipment you need to attack the enemy town until it falls.
05Dt 21:1 "When you are in the land the LORD your God is giving you, someone may be found murdered in a field, and you don't know who committed the murder.
05Dt 21:2 In such a case, your elders and judges must measure the distance from the site of the crime to the nearby towns.
05Dt 21:3 When the nearest town has been determined, that town's elders must select from the herd a young cow that has never been trained or yoked to a plow.
05Dt 21:4 They must lead it down to a valley that has not been plowed or planted and that has a stream running through it. There in the valley they must break the young cow's neck.
05Dt 21:5 Then the Levitical priests must step forward, for the LORD your God has chosen them to minister before him and to pronounce blessings in the LORD's name. They are to decide all legal and criminal cases.
05Dt 21:6 "The elders of the town must wash their hands over the young cow whose neck was broken.
05Dt 21:7 Then they must say, 'Our hands did not shed this person's blood, nor did we see it happen.
05Dt 21:8 O LORD, forgive your people Israel whom you have redeemed. Do not charge your people with the guilt of murdering an innocent person.' Then they will be absolved of the guilt of this person's blood.
05Dt 21:9 By following these instructions, you will do what is right in the LORD's sight and will cleanse the guilt of murder from your community.
05Dt 21:10 "Suppose you go out to war against your enemies and the LORD your God hands them over to you, and you take some of them as captives.
05Dt 21:11 And suppose you see among the captives a beautiful woman, and you are attracted to her and want to marry her.
05Dt 21:12 If this happens, you may take her to your home, where she must shave her head, cut her nails,
05Dt 21:13 and change the clothes she was wearing when she was captured. She will stay in your home, but let her mourn for her father and mother for a full month. Then you may marry her, and you will be her husband and she will be your wife.
05Dt 21:14 But if you marry her and she does not please you, you must let her go free. You may not sell her or treat her as a slave, for you have humiliated her.
05Dt 21:15 "Suppose a man has two wives, but he loves one and not the other, and both have given him sons. And suppose the firstborn son is the son of the wife he does not love.
05Dt 21:16 When the man divides his inheritance, he may not give the larger inheritance to his younger son, the son of the wife he loves, as if he were the firstborn son.
05Dt 21:17 He must recognize the rights of his oldest son, the son of the wife he does not love, by giving him a double portion. He is the first son of his father's virility, and the rights of the firstborn belong to him.
05Dt 21:18 "Suppose a man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey his father or mother, even though they discipline him.
05Dt 21:19 In such a case, the father and mother must take the son to the elders as they hold court at the town gate.
05Dt 21:20 The parents must say to the elders, 'This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious and refuses to obey. He is a glutton and a drunkard.'
05Dt 21:21 Then all the men of his town must stone him to death. In this way, you will purge this evil from among you, and all Israel will hear about it and be afraid.
05Dt 21:22 "If someone has committed a crime worthy of death and is executed and hung on a tree¨ç, / ¨ç{Or impaled on a pole; similarly in 21.23}
05Dt 21:23 the body must not remain hanging from the tree overnight. You must bury the body that same day, for anyone who is hung¨ç is cursed in the sight of God. In this way, you will prevent the defilement of the land the LORD your God is giving you as your special possession. / ¨ç{Greek version reads for everyone who is hung on a tree. Compare Gal 3.13}
05Dt 22:1 "If you see your neighbor's ox or sheep or goat wandering away, don't ignore your responsibility¨ç. Take it back to its owner. / ¨ç{Hebrew don't hide yourself; similarly in 22.3}
05Dt 22:2 If its owner does not live nearby or you don't know who the owner is, take it to your place and keep it until the owner comes looking for it. Then you must return it.
05Dt 22:3 Do the same if you find your neighbor's donkey, clothing, or anything else your neighbor loses. Don't ignore your responsibility.
05Dt 22:4 "If you see that your neighbor's donkey or ox has collapsed on the road, do not look the other way. Go and help your neighbor get it back on its feet!
05Dt 22:5 "A woman must not put on men's clothing, and a man must not wear women's clothing. Anyone who does this is detestable in the sight of the LORD your God.
05Dt 22:6 "If you happen to find a bird's nest in a tree or on the ground, and there are young ones or eggs in it with the mother sitting in the nest, do not take the mother with the young.
05Dt 22:7 You may take the young, but let the mother go, so that you may prosper and enjoy a long life.
05Dt 22:8 "When you build a new house, you must build a railing around the edge of its flat roof. That way you will not be considered guilty of murder if someone falls from the roof.
05Dt 22:9 "You must not plant any other crop between the rows of your vineyard. If you do, you are forbidden to use either the grapes from the vineyard or the other crop.
05Dt 22:10 "You must not plow with an ox and a donkey harnessed together.
05Dt 22:11 "You must not wear clothing made of wool and linen woven together.
05Dt 22:12 "You must put four tassels on the hem of the cloak with which you cover yourself - on the front, back, and sides.
05Dt 22:13 "Suppose a man marries a woman, but after sleeping with her, he turns against her
05Dt 22:14 and publicly accuses her of shameful conduct, saying, 'When I married this woman, I discovered she was not a virgin.'
05Dt 22:15 Then the woman's father and mother must bring the proof of her virginity to the elders as they hold court at the town gate.
05Dt 22:16 Her father must say to them, 'I gave my daughter to this man to be his wife, and now he has turned against her.
05Dt 22:17 He has accused her of shameful conduct, saying, "I discovered that your daughter was not a virgin." But here is the proof of my daughter's virginity.' Then they must spread her bed sheet before the elders.
05Dt 22:18 The elders must then take the man and punish him.
05Dt 22:19 They must also fine him 100 pieces of silver¨ç, which he must pay to the woman's father because he publicly accused a virgin of Israel of shameful conduct. The woman will then remain the man's wife, and he may never divorce her. / ¨ç{Hebrew 100 shekels of silver, about 2.5 pounds or 1.1 kilograms in weight}
05Dt 22:20 "But suppose the man's accusations are true, and he can show that she was not a virgin.
05Dt 22:21 The woman must be taken to the door of her father's home, and there the men of the town must stone her to death, for she has committed a disgraceful crime in Israel by being promiscuous while living in her parents' home. In this way, you will purge this evil from among you.
05Dt 22:22 "If a man is discovered committing adultery, both he and the woman must die. In this way, you will purge Israel of such evil.
05Dt 22:23 "Suppose a man meets a young woman, a virgin who is engaged to be married, and he has sexual intercourse with her. If this happens within a town,
05Dt 22:24 you must take both of them to the gates of that town and stone them to death. The woman is guilty because she did not scream for help. The man must die because he violated another man's wife. In this way, you will purge this evil from among you.
05Dt 22:25 "But if the man meets the engaged woman out in the country, and he rapes her, then only the man must die.
05Dt 22:26 Do nothing to the young woman; she has committed no crime worthy of death. She is as innocent as a murder victim.
05Dt 22:27 Since the man raped her out in the country, it must be assumed that she screamed, but there was no one to rescue her.
05Dt 22:28 "Suppose a man has intercourse with a young woman who is a virgin but is not engaged to be married. If they are discovered,

05Dt 23:5 But the LORD your God refused to listen to Balaam. He turned the intended curse into a blessing because the LORD your God loves you.
05Dt 23:6 As long as you live, you must never promote the welfare and prosperity of the Ammonites or Moabites.
05Dt 23:7 "Do not detest the Edomites or the Egyptians, because the Edomites are your relatives and you lived as foreigners among the Egyptians.

05Dt 23:13 Each of you must have a spade as part of your equipment. Whenever you relieve yourself, dig a hole with the spade and cover the excrement.

05Dt 24:3 But if the second husband also turns against her and divorces her, or if he dies,

05Dt 28:9 "If you obey the commands of the LORD your God and walk in his ways, the LORD will establish you as his holy people as he swore he would do.
05Dt 28:10 Then all the nations of the world will see that you are a people claimed by the LORD, and they will stand in awe of you.
05Dt 28:11 "The LORD will give you prosperity in the land he swore to your ancestors to give you, blessing you with many children, numerous livestock, and abundant crops.
05Dt 28:12 The LORD will send rain at the proper time from his rich treasury in the heavens and will bless all the work you do. You will lend to many nations, but you will never need to borrow from them.
05Dt 28:13 If you listen to these commands of the LORD your God that I am giving you today, and if you carefully obey them, the LORD will make you the head and not the tail, and you will always be on top and never at the bottom.
05Dt 28:14 You must not turn away from any of the commands I am giving you today, nor follow after other gods and worship them.
05Dt 28:15 "But if you refuse to listen to the LORD your God and do not obey all the commands and decrees I am giving you today, all these curses will come and overwhelm you.
05Dt 28:16 Your towns and your fields will be cursed.

05Dt 28:21 The LORD will afflict you with diseases until none of you are left in the land you are about to enter and occupy.
05Dt 28:22 The LORD will strike you with wasting diseases, fever, and inflammation, with scorching heat and drought, and with blight and mildew. These disasters will pursue you until you die.
05Dt 28:23 The skies above will be as unyielding as bronze, and the earth beneath will be as hard as iron.
05Dt 28:24 The LORD will change the rain that falls on your land into powder, and dust will pour down from the sky until you are destroyed.
05Dt 28:25 "The LORD will cause you to be defeated by your enemies. You will attack your enemies from one direction, but you will scatter from them in seven! You will be an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
05Dt 28:26 Your corpses will be food for all the scavenging birds and wild animals, and no one will be there to chase them away.
05Dt 28:27 "The LORD will afflict you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors, scurvy, and the itch, from which you cannot be cured.
05Dt 28:28 The LORD will strike you with madness, blindness, and panic.
05Dt 28:29 You will grope around in broad daylight like a blind person groping in the darkness, but you will not find your way. You will be oppressed and robbed continually, and no one will come to save you.
05Dt 28:30 "You will be engaged to a woman, but another man will sleep with her. You will build a house, but someone else will live in it. You will plant a vineyard, but you will never enjoy its fruit.
05Dt 28:31 Your ox will be butchered before your eyes, but you will not eat a single bite of the meat. Your donkey will be taken from you, never to be returned. Your sheep and goats will be given to your enemies, and no one will be there to help you.
05Dt 28:32 You will watch as your sons and daughters are taken away as slaves. Your heart will break for them, but you won't be able to help them.
05Dt 28:33 A foreign nation you have never heard about will eat the crops you worked so hard to grow. You will suffer under constant oppression and harsh treatment.
05Dt 28:34 You will go mad because of all the tragedy you see around you.
05Dt 28:35 The LORD will cover your knees and legs with incurable boils. In fact, you will be covered from head to foot.
05Dt 28:36 "The LORD will exile you and your king to a nation unknown to you and your ancestors. There in exile you will worship gods of wood and stone!
05Dt 28:37 You will become an object of horror, ridicule, and mockery among all the nations to which the LORD sends you.
05Dt 28:38 "You will plant much but harvest little, for locusts will eat your crops.
05Dt 28:39 You will plant vineyards and care for them, but you will not drink the wine or eat the grapes, for worms will destroy the vines.

05Dt 28:45 "If you refuse to listen to the LORD your God and to obey the commands and decrees he has given you, all these curses will pursue and overtake you until you are destroyed.
05Dt 28:46 These horrors will serve as a sign and warning among you and your descendants forever.
05Dt 28:47 If you do not serve the LORD your God with joy and enthusiasm for the abundant benefits you have received,
05Dt 28:48 you will serve your enemies whom the LORD will send against you. You will be left hungry, thirsty, naked, and lacking in everything. The LORD will put an iron yoke on your neck, oppressing you harshly until he has destroyed you.
05Dt 28:49 "The LORD will bring a distant nation against you from the end of the earth, and it will swoop down on you like a vulture. It is a nation whose language you do not understand,
05Dt 28:50 a fierce and heartless nation that shows no respect for the old and no pity for the young.
05Dt 28:51 Its armies will devour your livestock and crops, and you will be destroyed. They will leave you no grain, new wine, olive oil, calves, or lambs, and you will starve to death.
05Dt 28:52 They will attack your cities until all the fortified walls in your land - the walls you trusted to protect you - are knocked down. They will attack all the towns in the land the LORD your God has given you.
05Dt 28:53 "The siege and terrible distress of the enemy's attack will be so severe that you will eat the flesh of your own sons and daughters, whom the LORD your God has given you.
05Dt 28:54 The most tenderhearted man among you will have no compassion for his own brother, his beloved wife, and his surviving children.
05Dt 28:55 He will refuse to share with them the flesh he is devouring - the flesh of one of his own children - because he has nothing else to eat during the siege and terrible distress that your enemy will inflict on all your towns.
05Dt 28:56 The most tender and delicate woman among you - so delicate she would not so much as touch the ground with her foot - will be selfish toward the husband she loves and toward her own son or daughter.
05Dt 28:57 She will hide from them the afterbirth and the new baby she has borne, so that she herself can secretly eat them. She will have nothing else to eat during the siege and terrible distress that your enemy will inflict on all your towns.
05Dt 28:58 "If you refuse to obey all the words of instruction that are written in this book, and if you do not fear the glorious and awesome name of the LORD your God,
05Dt 28:59 then the LORD will overwhelm you and your children with indescribable plagues. These plagues will be intense and without relief, making you miserable and unbearably sick.
05Dt 28:60 He will afflict you with all the diseases of Egypt that you feared so much, and you will have no relief.
05Dt 28:61 The LORD will afflict you with every sickness and plague there is, even those not mentioned in this Book of Instruction, until you are destroyed.
05Dt 28:62 Though you become as numerous as the stars in the sky, few of you will be left because you would not listen to the LORD your God.
05Dt 28:63 "Just as the LORD has found great pleasure in causing you to prosper and multiply, the LORD will find pleasure in destroying you. You will be torn from the land you are about to enter and occupy.
05Dt 28:64 For the LORD will scatter you among all the nations from one end of the earth to the other. There you will worship foreign gods that neither you nor your ancestors have known, gods made of wood and stone!
05Dt 28:65 There among those nations you will find no peace or place to rest. And the LORD will cause your heart to tremble, your eyesight to fail, and your soul to despair.
05Dt 28:66 Your life will constantly hang in the balance. You will live night and day in fear, unsure if you will survive.
05Dt 28:67 In the morning you will say, 'If only it were night!' And in the evening you will say, 'If only it were morning!' For you will be terrified by the awful horrors you see around you.
05Dt 28:68 Then the LORD will send you back to Egypt in ships, to a destination I promised you would never see again. There you will offer to sell yourselves to your enemies as slaves, but no one will buy you."
05Dt 29:1 ¨çThese are the terms of the covenant the LORD commanded Moses to make with the Israelites while they were in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant he had made with them at Mount Sinai¨è. / ¨ç{Verse 29.1 is numbered 28.69 in Hebrew text} ¨è{Hebrew Horeb, another name for Sinai}
05Dt 29:2 ¨çMoses summoned all the Israelites and said to them, "You have seen with your own eyes everything the LORD did in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh and to all his servants and to his whole country - / ¨ç{Verses 29.2-29 are numbered 29.1-28 in Hebrew text}
05Dt 29:3 all the great tests of strength, the miraculous signs, and the amazing wonders.
05Dt 29:4 But to this day the LORD has not given you minds that understand, nor eyes that see, nor ears that hear!
05Dt 29:5 For forty years I led you through the wilderness, yet your clothes and sandals did not wear out.
05Dt 29:6 You ate no bread and drank no wine or other alcoholic drink, but he gave you food so you would know that he is the LORD your God.
05Dt 29:7 "When we came here, King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan came out to fight against us, but we defeated them.
05Dt 29:8 We took their land and gave it to the tribes of Reuben and Gad and to the half-tribe of Manasseh as their grant of land.
05Dt 29:9 "Therefore, obey the terms of this covenant so that you will prosper in everything you do.
05Dt 29:10 All of you - tribal leaders, elders, officers, all the men of Israel - are standing today in the presence of the LORD your God.
05Dt 29:11 Your little ones and your wives are with you, as well as the foreigners living among you who chop your wood and carry your water.
05Dt 29:12 You are standing here today to enter into the covenant of the LORD your God. The LORD is making this covenant, including the curses.
05Dt 29:13 By entering into the covenant today, he will establish you as his people and confirm that he is your God, just as he promised you and as he swore to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
05Dt 29:14 "But you are not the only ones with whom I am making this covenant with its curses.
05Dt 29:15 I am making this covenant both with you who stand here today in the presence of the LORD our God, and also with the future generations who are not standing here today.
05Dt 29:16 "You remember how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we traveled through the lands of enemy nations as we left.
05Dt 29:17 You have seen their detestable practices and their idols¨ç made of wood, stone, silver, and gold. / ¨ç{The Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung}
05Dt 29:18 I am making this covenant with you so that no one among you - no man, woman, clan, or tribe - will turn away from the LORD our God to worship these gods of other nations, and so that no root among you bears bitter and poisonous fruit.
05Dt 29:19 "Those who hear the warnings of this curse should not congratulate themselves, thinking, 'I am safe, even though I am following the desires of my own stubborn heart.' This would lead to utter ruin!
05Dt 29:20 The LORD will never pardon such people. Instead his anger and jealousy will burn against them. All the curses written in this book will come down on them, and the LORD will erase their names from under heaven.
05Dt 29:21 The LORD will separate them from all the tribes of Israel, to pour out on them all the curses of the covenant recorded in this Book of Instruction.
05Dt 29:22 "Then the generations to come, both your own descendants and the foreigners who come from distant lands, will see the devastation of the land and the diseases the LORD inflicts on it.
05Dt 29:23 They will exclaim, 'The whole land is devastated by sulfur and salt. It is a wasteland with nothing planted and nothing growing, not even a blade of grass. It is like the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD destroyed in his intense anger.'
05Dt 29:24 "And all the surrounding nations will ask, 'Why has the LORD done this to this land? Why was he so angry?'
05Dt 29:25 "And the answer will be, 'This happened because the people of the land abandoned the covenant that the LORD, the God of their ancestors, made with them when he brought them out of the land of Egypt.
05Dt 29:26 Instead, they turned away to serve and worship gods they had not known before, gods that were not from the LORD.
05Dt 29:27 That is why the LORD's anger has burned against this land, bringing down on it every curse recorded in this book.
05Dt 29:28 In great anger and fury the LORD uprooted his people from their land and banished them to another land, where they still live today!'
05Dt 29:29 "The LORD our God has secrets known to no one. We are not accountable for them, but we and our children are accountable forever for all that he has revealed to us, so that we may obey all the terms of these instructions.
05Dt 30:1 "In the future, when you experience all these blessings and curses I have listed for you, and when you are living among the nations to which the LORD your God has exiled you, take to heart all these instructions.
05Dt 30:2 If at that time you and your children return to the LORD your God, and if you obey with all your heart and all your soul all the commands I have given you today,
05Dt 30:3 then the LORD your God will restore your fortunes. He will have mercy on you and gather you back from all the nations where he has scattered you.
05Dt 30:4 Even though you are banished to the ends of the earth, the LORD your God will gather you from there and bring you back again.
05Dt 30:5 The LORD your God will return you to the land that belonged to your ancestors, and you will possess that land again. Then he will make you even more prosperous and numerous than your ancestors!
05Dt 30:6 "The LORD your God will change your heart¨ç and the hearts of all your descendants, so that you will love him with all your heart and soul and so you may live! / ¨ç{Hebrew circumcise your heart}
05Dt 30:7 The LORD your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate and persecute you.
05Dt 30:8 Then you will again obey the LORD and keep all his commands that I am giving you today.
05Dt 30:9 "The LORD your God will then make you successful in everything you do. He will give you many children and numerous livestock, and he will cause your fields to produce abundant harvests, for the LORD will again delight in being good to you as he was to your ancestors.
05Dt 30:10 The LORD your God will delight in you if you obey his voice and keep the commands and decrees written in this Book of Instruction, and if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and soul.
05Dt 30:11 "This command I am giving you today is not too difficult for you to understand, and it is not beyond your reach.
05Dt 30:12 It is not kept in heaven, so distant that you must ask, 'Who will go up to heaven and bring it down so we can hear it and obey?'
05Dt 30:13 It is not kept beyond the sea, so far away that you must ask, 'Who will cross the sea to bring it to us so we can hear it and obey?'
05Dt 30:14 No, the message is very close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart so that you can obey it.
05Dt 30:15 "Now listen! Today I am giving you a choice between life and death, between prosperity and disaster.
05Dt 30:16 For I command you this day to love the LORD your God and to keep his commands, decrees, and regulations by walking in his ways. If you do this, you will live and multiply, and the LORD your God will bless you and the land you are about to enter and occupy.
05Dt 30:17 "But if your heart turns away and you refuse to listen, and if you are drawn away to serve and worship other gods,
05Dt 30:18 then I warn you now that you will certainly be destroyed. You will not live a long, good life in the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy.
05Dt 30:19 "Today I have given you the choice between life and death, between blessings and curses. Now I call on heaven and earth to witness the choice you make. Oh, that you would choose life, so that you and your descendants might live!
05Dt 30:20 You can make this choice by loving the LORD your God, obeying him, and committing yourself firmly to him. This¨ç is the key to your life. And if you love and obey the LORD, you will live long in the land the LORD swore to give your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob." / ¨ç{Or He}
05Dt 31:1 When Moses had finished giving these instructions¨ç to all the people of Israel, / ¨ç{As in Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version; Masoretic Text reads Moses went and spoke}
05Dt 31:2 he said, "I am now 120 years old, and I am no longer able to lead you. The LORD has told me, 'You will not cross the Jordan River.'
05Dt 31:3 But the LORD your God himself will cross over ahead of you. He will destroy the nations living there, and you will take possession of their land. Joshua will lead you across the river, just as the LORD promised.
05Dt 31:4 "The LORD will destroy the nations living in the land, just as he destroyed Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites.
05Dt 31:5 The LORD will hand over to you the people who live there, and you must deal with them as I have commanded you.
05Dt 31:6 So be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid and do not panic before them. For the LORD your God will personally go ahead of you. He will neither fail you nor abandon you."
05Dt 31:7 Then Moses called for Joshua, and as all Israel watched, he said to him, "Be strong and courageous! For you will lead these people into the land that the LORD swore to their ancestors he would give them. You are the one who will divide it among them as their grants of land.
05Dt 31:8 Do not be afraid or discouraged, for the LORD will personally go ahead of you. He will be with you; he will neither fail you nor abandon you."
05Dt 31:9 So Moses wrote this entire body of instruction in a book and gave it to the priests, who carried the Ark of the LORD's Covenant, and to the elders of Israel.
05Dt 31:10 Then Moses gave them this command£º "At the end of every seventh year, the Year of Release, during the Festival of Shelters,
05Dt 31:11 you must read this Book of Instruction to all the people of Israel when they assemble before the LORD your God at the place he chooses.
05Dt 31:12 Call them all together - men, women, children, and the foreigners living in your towns - so they may hear this Book of Instruction and learn to fear the LORD your God and carefully obey all the terms of these instructions.
05Dt 31:13 Do this so that your children who have not known these instructions will hear them and will learn to fear the LORD your God. Do this as long as you live in the land you are crossing the Jordan to occupy."
05Dt 31:14 Then the LORD said to Moses, "The time has come for you to die. Call Joshua and present yourselves at the Tabernacle¨ç, so that I may commission him there." So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the Tabernacle. / ¨ç{Hebrew Tent of Meeting; also in 31.14b}
05Dt 31:15 And the LORD appeared to them in a pillar of cloud that stood at the entrance to the sacred tent.
05Dt 31:16 The LORD said to Moses, "You are about to die and join your ancestors. After you are gone, these people will begin to worship foreign gods, the gods of the land where they are going. They will abandon me and break my covenant that I have made with them.
05Dt 31:17 Then my anger will blaze forth against them. I will abandon them, hiding my face from them, and they will be devoured. Terrible trouble will come down on them, and on that day they will say, 'These disasters have come down on us because God is no longer among us!'
05Dt 31:18 At that time I will hide my face from them on account of all the evil they commit by worshiping other gods.
05Dt 31:19 "So write down the words of this song, and teach it to the people of Israel. Help them learn it, so it may serve as a witness for me against them.
05Dt 31:20 For I will bring them into the land I swore to give their ancestors - a land flowing with milk and honey. There they will become prosperous, eat all the food they want, and become fat. But they will begin to worship other gods; they will despise me and break my covenant.
05Dt 31:21 And when great disasters come down on them, this song will stand as evidence against them, for it will never be forgotten by their descendants. I know the intentions of these people, even now before they have entered the land I swore to give them."
05Dt 31:22 So that very day Moses wrote down the words of the song and taught it to the Israelites.
05Dt 31:23 Then the LORD commissioned Joshua son of Nun with these words£º "Be strong and courageous, for you must bring the people of Israel into the land I swore to give them. I will be with you."
05Dt 31:24 When Moses had finished writing this entire body of instruction in a book,
05Dt 31:25 he gave this command to the Levites who carried the Ark of the LORD's Covenant.
05Dt 31:26 "Take this Book of Instruction and place it beside the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD your God, so it may remain there as a witness against the people of Israel.
05Dt 31:27 For I know how rebellious and stubborn you are. Even now, while I am still alive and am here with you, you have rebelled against the LORD. How much more rebellious will you be after my death!
05Dt 31:28 "Now summon all the elders and officials of your tribes, so that I can speak to them directly and call heaven and earth to witness against them.
05Dt 31:29 I know that after my death you will become utterly corrupt and will turn from the way I have commanded you to follow. In the days to come, disaster will come down on you, for you will do what is evil in the LORD's sight, making him very angry with your actions."
05Dt 31:30 So Moses recited this entire song publicly to the assembly of Israel.
05Dt 32:1 "Listen, O heavens, and I will speak! Hear, O earth, the words that I say!
05Dt 32:2 Let my teaching fall on you like rain; let my speech settle like dew. Let my words fall like rain on tender grass, like gentle showers on young plants.
05Dt 32:3 I will proclaim the name of the LORD; how glorious is our God!
05Dt 32:4 He is the Rock; his deeds are perfect.Everything he does is just and fair. He is a faithful God who does no wrong; how just and upright he is!
05Dt 32:5 "But they have acted corruptly toward him; when they act so perversely, are they really his children?¨ç They are a deceitful and twisted generation. / ¨ç{The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
05Dt 32:6 Is this the way you repay the LORD, you foolish and senseless people? Isn't he your Father who created you? Has he not made you and established you?
05Dt 32:7 Remember the days of long ago; think about the generations past. Ask your father, and he will inform you.Inquire of your elders, and they will tell you.
05Dt 32:8 When the Most High assigned lands to the nations, when he divided up the human race, he established the boundaries of the peoples according to the number in his heavenly court¨ç. / ¨ç{As in Dead Sea Scrolls, which read the number of the sons of God, and Greek version, which reads the number of the angels of God; Masoretic Text reads the number of the sons of Israel}
05Dt 32:9 "For the people of Israel belong to the LORD; Jacob is his special possession.
05Dt 32:10 He found them in a desert land, in an empty, howling wasteland. He surrounded them and watched over them; he guarded them as he would guard his own eyes¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew as the pupil of his eye}
05Dt 32:11 Like an eagle that rouses her chicks and hovers over her young, so he spread his wings to take them up and carried them safely on his pinions.
05Dt 32:12 The LORD alone guided them; they followed no foreign gods. 
05Dt 32:13 He let them ride over the highlands and feast on the crops of the fields. He nourished them with honey from the rock and olive oil from the stony ground.
05Dt 32:14 He fed them yogurt from the herd and milk from the flock, together with the fat of lambs. He gave them choice rams from Bashan, and goats, together with the choicest wheat. You drank the finest wine, made from the juice of grapes.
05Dt 32:15 "But Israel¨ç soon became fat and unruly; the people grew heavy, plump, and stuffed! Then they abandoned the God who had made them; they made light of the Rock of their salvation. / ¨ç{Hebrew Jeshurun, a term of endearment for Israel}
05Dt 32:16 They stirred up his jealousy by worshiping foreign gods; they provoked his fury with detestable deeds.
05Dt 32:17 They offered sacrifices to demons, which are not God, to gods they had not known before, to new gods only recently arrived, to gods their ancestors had never feared.
05Dt 32:18 You neglected the Rock who had fathered you; you forgot the God who had given you birth.
05Dt 32:19 "The LORD saw this and drew back, provoked to anger by his own sons and daughters.
05Dt 32:20 He said, 'I will abandon them; then see what becomes of them. For they are a twisted generation, children without integrity.
05Dt 32:21 They have roused my jealousy by worshiping things that are not God; they have provoked my anger with their useless idols. Now I will rouse their jealousy through people who are not even a people; I will provoke their anger through the foolish Gentiles.
05Dt 32:22 For my anger blazes forth like fire and burns to the depths of the grave¨ç. It devours the earth and all its crops and ignites the foundations of the mountains. / ¨ç{Hebrew of Sheol}
05Dt 32:23 I will heap disasters upon them and shoot them down with my arrows.
05Dt 32:24 I will weaken them with famine, burning fever, and deadly disease. I will send the fangs of wild beasts and poisonous snakes that glide in the dust.
05Dt 32:25 Outside, the sword will bring death, and inside, terror will strike both young men and young women, both infants and the aged.
05Dt 32:26 I would have annihilated them, wiping out even the memory of them.
05Dt 32:27 But I feared the taunt of Israel's enemy, who might misunderstand and say, "Our own power has triumphed! The LORD had nothing to do with this!"'
05Dt 32:28 "But Israel is a senseless nation; the people are foolish, without understanding.
05Dt 32:29 Oh, that they were wise and could understand this! Oh, that they might know their fate!
05Dt 32:30 How could one person chase a thousand of them, and two people put ten thousand to flight, unless their Rock had sold them, unless the LORD had given them up?
05Dt 32:31 But the rock of our enemies is not like our Rock, as even they recognize¨ç. / ¨ç{The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. Greek version reads our enemies are fools}
05Dt 32:32 Their vine grows from the vine of Sodom, from the vineyards of Gomorrah. Their grapes are poison, and their clusters are bitter.
05Dt 32:33 Their wine is the venom of serpents, the deadly poison of cobras.
05Dt 32:34 "The LORD says, 'Am I not storing up these things, sealing them away in my treasury?
05Dt 32:35 I will take revenge; I will pay them back.In due time their feet will slip. Their day of disaster will arrive, and their destiny will overtake them.'
05Dt 32:36 "Indeed, the LORD will give justice to his people, and he will change his mind about¨ç his servants, when he sees their strength is gone and no one is left, slave or free. / ¨ç{Or will take revenge for}
05Dt 32:37 Then he will ask, 'Where are their gods, the rocks they fled to for refuge?
05Dt 32:38 Where now are those gods, who ate the fat of their sacrifices and drank the wine of their offerings? Let those gods arise and help you! Let them provide you with shelter!
05Dt 32:39 Look now; I myself am he! There is no other god but me! I am the one who kills and gives life; I am the one who wounds and heals; no one can be rescued from my powerful hand!
05Dt 32:40 Now I raise my hand to heaven and declare, "As surely as I live,
05Dt 32:41 when I sharpen my flashing sword and begin to carry out justice, I will take revenge on my enemies and repay those who reject me.
05Dt 32:42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood, and my sword will devour flesh - the blood of the slaughtered and the captives, and the heads of the enemy leaders."'
05Dt 32:43 "Rejoice with him, you heavens, and let all of God's angels worship him¨ç. Rejoice with his people, you nations, and let all the angels be strengthened in him¨è. For he will avenge the blood of his servants; he will take revenge against his enemies. He will repay those who hate him¨é and cleanse the land for his people." / ¨ç{As in Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version; Masoretic Text lacks the first two lines. Compare Heb 1.6} ¨è{As in Greek version; Hebrew text lacks this line} ¨é{As in Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version; Masoretic Text lacks this line}
05Dt 32:44 So Moses came with Joshua¨ç son of Nun and recited all the words of this song to the people. / ¨ç{Hebrew Hoshea, a variant name for Joshua}
05Dt 32:45 When Moses had finished reciting all these words to the people of Israel,
05Dt 32:46 he added£º "Take to heart all the words of warning I have given you today. Pass them on as a command to your children so they will obey every word of these instructions.
05Dt 32:47 These instructions are not empty words - they are your life! By obeying them you will enjoy a long life in the land you will occupy when you cross the Jordan River."
05Dt 32:48 That same day the LORD said to Moses,
05Dt 32:49 "Go to Moab, to the mountains east of the river¨ç, and climb Mount Nebo, which is across from Jericho. Look out across the land of Canaan, the land I am giving to the people of Israel as their own special possession. / ¨ç{Hebrew the mountains of Abarim}
05Dt 32:50 Then you will die there on the mountain. You will join your ancestors, just as Aaron, your brother, died on Mount Hor and joined his ancestors.
05Dt 32:51 For both of you betrayed me with the Israelites at the waters of Meribah at Kadesh¨ç in the wilderness of Zin. You failed to demonstrate my holiness to the people of Israel there. / ¨ç{Hebrew waters of Meribath-kadesh}
05Dt 32:52 So you will see the land from a distance, but you may not enter the land I am giving to the people of Israel."
05Dt 33:1 This is the blessing that Moses, the man of God, gave to the people of Israel before his death.
05Dt 33:2 "The LORD came from Mount Sinai and dawned upon us¨ç from Mount Seir; he shone forth from Mount Paran and came from Meribah-kadesh with flaming fire at his right hand¨è. / ¨ç{As in Greek and Syriac versions; Hebrew reads upon them} ¨è{Or came from myriads of holy ones, from the south, from his mountain slopes. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
05Dt 33:3 Indeed, he loves his people¨ç; all his holy ones are in his hands. They follow in his steps and accept his teaching. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads Indeed, lover of the peoples}
05Dt 33:4 Moses gave us the LORD's instruction, the special possession of the people of Israel¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew of Jacob. The names "Jacob" and "Israel" are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation}
05Dt 33:5 The LORD became king in Israel¨ç - when the leaders of the people assembled, when the tribes of Israel gathered as one." / ¨ç{Hebrew in Jeshurun, a term of endearment for Israel}
05Dt 33:6 Moses said this about the tribe of Reuben.¨ç "Let the tribe of Reuben live and not die out, though they are few in number." / ¨ç{Hebrew lacks Moses said this about the tribe of Reuben}
05Dt 33:7 Moses said this about the tribe of Judah£º "O LORD, hear the cry of Judah and bring them together as a people. Give them strength to defend their cause; help them against their enemies!"
05Dt 33:8 Moses said this about the tribe of Levi£º "O LORD, you have given your Thummim and Urim - the sacred lots - to your faithful servants the Levites¨ç. You put them to the test at Massah and struggled with them at the waters of Meribah. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew lacks the Levites}
05Dt 33:9 The Levites obeyed your word and guarded your covenant. They were more loyal to you than to their own parents. They ignored their relatives and did not acknowledge their own children.
05Dt 33:10 They teach your regulations to Jacob; they give your instructions to Israel. They present incense before you and offer whole burnt offerings on the altar.
05Dt 33:11 Bless the ministry of the Levites, O LORD, and accept all the work of their hands. Hit their enemies where it hurts the most; strike down their foes so they never rise again."
05Dt 33:12 Moses said this about the tribe of Benjamin£º "The people of Benjamin are loved by the LORD and live in safety beside him. He surrounds them continuously and preserves them from every harm."
05Dt 33:13 Moses said this about the tribes of Joseph£º "May their land be blessed by the LORD with the precious gift of dew from the heavens and water from beneath the earth;
05Dt 33:14 with the rich fruit that grows in the sun, and the rich harvest produced each month;
05Dt 33:15 with the finest crops of the ancient mountains, and the abundance from the everlasting hills;
05Dt 33:16 with the best gifts of the earth and its bounty, and the favor of the one who appeared in the burning bush. May these blessings rest on Joseph's head, crowning the brow of the prince among his brothers.
05Dt 33:17 Joseph has the majesty of a young bull; he has the horns of a wild ox. He will gore distant nations, driving them to the ends of the earth. This is my blessing for the multitudes of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh."
05Dt 33:18 Moses said this about the tribes of Zebulun and Issachar¨ç£º "May the people of Zebulun prosper in their travels.May the people of Issachar prosper at home in their tents. / ¨ç{Hebrew lacks and Issachar}
05Dt 33:19 They summon the people to the mountain to offer proper sacrifices there. They benefit from the riches of the sea and the hidden treasures in the sand."
05Dt 33:20 Moses said this about the tribe of Gad£º "Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad's territory! Gad is poised there like a lion to tear off an arm or a head.
05Dt 33:21 The people of Gad took the best land for themselves; a leader's share was assigned to them. When the leaders of the people were assembled, they carried out the LORD's justice and obeyed his regulations for Israel."
05Dt 33:22 Moses said this about the tribe of Dan£º "Dan is a lion's cub, leaping out from Bashan."
05Dt 33:23 Moses said this about the tribe of Naphtali£º "O Naphtali, you are rich in favor and full of the LORD's blessings; may you possess the west and the south."
05Dt 33:24 Moses said this about the tribe of Asher£º "May Asher be blessed above other sons; may he be esteemed by his brothers; may he bathe his feet in olive oil.
05Dt 33:25 May the bolts of your gates be of iron and bronze; may you be secure all your days."
05Dt 33:26 "There is no one like the God of Israel¨ç. He rides across the heavens to help you, across the skies in majestic splendor. / ¨ç{Hebrew of Jeshurun, a term of endearment for Israel}
05Dt 33:27 The eternal God is your refuge, and his everlasting arms are under you. He drives out the enemy before you; he cries out, 'Destroy them!'
05Dt 33:28 So Israel will live in safety, prosperous Jacob in security, in a land of grain and new wine, while the heavens drop down dew.
05Dt 33:29 How blessed you are, O Israel! Who else is like you, a people saved by the LORD? He is your protecting shield and your triumphant sword! Your enemies will cringe before you, and you will stomp on their backs!"
05Dt 34:1 Then Moses went up to Mount Nebo from the plains of Moab and climbed Pisgah Peak, which is across from Jericho. And the LORD showed him the whole land, from Gilead as far as Dan;
05Dt 34:2 all the land of Naphtali; the land of Ephraim and Manasseh; all the land of Judah, extending to the Mediterranean Sea¨ç; / ¨ç{Hebrew the western sea}
05Dt 34:3 the Negev; the Jordan Valley with Jericho - the city of palms - as far as Zoar.
05Dt 34:4 Then the LORD said to Moses, "This is the land I promised on oath to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob when I said, 'I will give it to your descendants.' I have now allowed you to see it with your own eyes, but you will not enter the land."
05Dt 34:5 So Moses, the servant of the LORD, died there in the land of Moab, just as the LORD had said.
05Dt 34:6 The LORD buried him¨ç in a valley near Beth-peor in Moab, but to this day no one knows the exact place. / ¨ç{Hebrew He buried him; Samaritan Pentateuch and some Greek manuscripts read They buried him}
05Dt 34:7 Moses was 120 years old when he died, yet his eyesight was clear, and he was as strong as ever.
05Dt 34:8 The people of Israel mourned for Moses on the plains of Moab for thirty days, until the customary period of mourning was over.
05Dt 34:9 Now Joshua son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him. So the people of Israel obeyed him, doing just as the LORD had commanded Moses.
05Dt 34:10 There has never been another prophet in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face.
05Dt 34:11 The LORD sent him to perform all the miraculous signs and wonders in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, and all his servants, and his entire land.
05Dt 34:12 With mighty power, Moses performed terrifying acts in the sight of all Israel.
06
06Jos 1:1 After the death of Moses the LORD's servant, the LORD spoke to Joshua son of Nun, Moses' assistant. He said,
06Jos 1:2 "Moses my servant is dead. Therefore, the time has come for you to lead these people, the Israelites, across the Jordan River into the land I am giving them.
06Jos 1:3 I promise you what I promised Moses£º 'Wherever you set foot, you will be on land I have given you - 
06Jos 1:4 from the Negev wilderness in the south to the Lebanon mountains in the north, from the Euphrates River in the east to the Mediterranean Sea¨ç in the west, including all the land of the Hittites.' / ¨ç{Hebrew the Great Sea}
06Jos 1:5 No one will be able to stand against you as long as you live. For I will be with you as I was with Moses. I will not fail you or abandon you.
06Jos 1:6 "Be strong and courageous, for you are the one who will lead these people to possess all the land I swore to their ancestors I would give them.
06Jos 1:7 Be strong and very courageous. Be careful to obey all the instructions Moses gave you. Do not deviate from them, turning either to the right or to the left. Then you will be successful in everything you do.
06Jos 1:8 Study this Book of Instruction continually. Meditate on it day and night so you will be sure to obey everything written in it. Only then will you prosper and succeed in all you do.
06Jos 1:9 This is my command - be strong and courageous! Do not be afraid or discouraged. For the LORD your God is with you wherever you go."
06Jos 1:10 Joshua then commanded the officers of Israel,
06Jos 1:11 "Go through the camp and tell the people to get their provisions ready. In three days you will cross the Jordan River and take possession of the land the LORD your God is giving you."
06Jos 1:12 Then Joshua called together the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. He told them,
06Jos 1:13 "Remember what Moses, the servant of the LORD, commanded you£º 'The LORD your God is giving you a place of rest. He has given you this land.'
06Jos 1:14 Your wives, children, and livestock may remain here in the land Moses assigned to you on the east side of the Jordan River. But your strong warriors, fully armed, must lead the other tribes across the Jordan to help them conquer their territory. Stay with them
06Jos 1:15 until the LORD gives them rest, as he has given you rest, and until they, too, possess the land the LORD your God is giving them. Only then may you return and settle here on the east side of the Jordan River in the land that Moses, the servant of the LORD, assigned to you."
06Jos 1:16 They answered Joshua, "We will do whatever you command us, and we will go wherever you send us.
06Jos 1:17 We will obey you just as we obeyed Moses. And may the LORD your God be with you as he was with Moses.
06Jos 1:18 Anyone who rebels against your orders and does not obey your words and everything you command will be put to death. So be strong and courageous!"
06Jos 2:1 Then Joshua secretly sent out two spies from the Israelite camp at Acacia Grove¨ç. He instructed them, "Scout out the land on the other side of the Jordan River, especially around Jericho." So the two men set out and came to the house of a prostitute named Rahab and stayed there that night. / ¨ç{Hebrew Shittim}
06Jos 2:2 But someone told the king of Jericho, "Some Israelites have come here tonight to spy out the land."
06Jos 2:3 So the king of Jericho sent orders to Rahab£º "Bring out the men who have come into your house, for they have come here to spy out the whole land."
06Jos 2:4 Rahab had hidden the two men, but she replied, "Yes, the men were here earlier, but I didn't know where they were from.
06Jos 2:5 They left the town at dusk, as the gates were about to close. I don't know where they went. If you hurry, you can probably catch up with them."
06Jos 2:6 (Actually, she had taken them up to the roof and hidden them beneath bundles of flax she had laid out.)
06Jos 2:7 So the king's men went looking for the spies along the road leading to the shallow crossings of the Jordan River. And as soon as the king's men had left, the gate of Jericho was shut.
06Jos 2:8 Before the spies went to sleep that night, Rahab went up on the roof to talk with them.
06Jos 2:9 "I know the LORD has given you this land," she told them. "We are all afraid of you. Everyone in the land is living in terror.
06Jos 2:10 For we have heard how the LORD made a dry path for you through the Red Sea¨ç when you left Egypt. And we know what you did to Sihon and Og, the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River, whose people you completely destroyed¨è. / ¨ç{Hebrew sea of reeds} ¨è{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering}
06Jos 2:11 No wonder our hearts have melted in fear! No one has the courage to fight after hearing such things. For the LORD your God is the supreme God of the heavens above and the earth below.
06Jos 2:12 "Now swear to me by the LORD that you will be kind to me and my family since I have helped you. Give me some guarantee that
06Jos 2:13 when Jericho is conquered, you will let me live, along with my father and mother, my brothers and sisters, and all their families."
06Jos 2:14 "We offer our own lives as a guarantee for your safety," the men agreed. "If you don't betray us, we will keep our promise and be kind to you when the LORD gives us the land."
06Jos 2:15 Then, since Rahab's house was built into the town wall, she let them down by a rope through the window.
06Jos 2:16 "Escape to the hill country," she told them. "Hide there for three days from the men searching for you. Then, when they have returned, you can go on your way."
06Jos 2:17 Before they left, the men told her, "We will be bound by the oath we have taken only if you follow these instructions.
06Jos 2:18 When we come into the land, you must leave this scarlet rope hanging from the window through which you let us down. And all your family members - your father, mother, brothers, and all your relatives - must be here inside the house.
06Jos 2:19 If they go out into the street and are killed, it will not be our fault. But if anyone lays a hand on people inside this house, we will accept the responsibility for their death.
06Jos 2:20 If you betray us, however, we are not bound by this oath in any way."
06Jos 2:21 "I accept your terms," she replied. And she sent them on their way, leaving the scarlet rope hanging from the window.
06Jos 2:22 The spies went up into the hill country and stayed there three days. The men who were chasing them searched everywhere along the road, but they finally returned without success.
06Jos 2:23 Then the two spies came down from the hill country, crossed the Jordan River, and reported to Joshua all that had happened to them.
06Jos 2:24 "The LORD has given us the whole land," they said, "for all the people in the land are terrified of us."
06Jos 3:1 Early the next morning Joshua and all the Israelites left Acacia Grove¨ç and arrived at the banks of the Jordan River, where they camped before crossing. / ¨ç{Hebrew Shittim}
06Jos 3:2 Three days later the Israelite officers went through the camp,
06Jos 3:3 giving these instructions to the people£º "When you see the Levitical priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD your God, move out from your positions and follow them.
06Jos 3:4 Since you have never traveled this way before, they will guide you. Stay about a half mile¨ç behind them, keeping a clear distance between you and the Ark. Make sure you don't come any closer." / ¨ç{Hebrew about 2,000 cubits [920 meters]}
06Jos 3:5 Then Joshua told the people, "Purify yourselves, for tomorrow the LORD will do great wonders among you."
06Jos 3:6 In the morning Joshua said to the priests, "Lift up the Ark of the Covenant and lead the people across the river." And so they started out and went ahead of the people.
06Jos 3:7 The LORD told Joshua, "Today I will begin to make you a great leader in the eyes of all the Israelites. They will know that I am with you, just as I was with Moses.
06Jos 3:8 Give this command to the priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant£º 'When you reach the banks of the Jordan River, take a few steps into the river and stop there.'"
06Jos 3:9 So Joshua told the Israelites, "Come and listen to what the LORD your God says.
06Jos 3:10 Today you will know that the living God is among you. He will surely drive out the Canaanites, Hittites, Hivites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites ahead of you.
06Jos 3:11 Look, the Ark of the Covenant, which belongs to the Lord of the whole earth, will lead you across the Jordan River!
06Jos 3:12 Now choose twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one from each tribe.
06Jos 3:13 The priests will carry the Ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth. As soon as their feet touch the water, the flow of water will be cut off upstream, and the river will stand up like a wall."
06Jos 3:14 So the people left their camp to cross the Jordan, and the priests who were carrying the Ark of the Covenant went ahead of them.
06Jos 3:15 It was the harvest season, and the Jordan was overflowing its banks. But as soon as the feet of the priests who were carrying the Ark touched the water at the river's edge,
06Jos 3:16 the water above that point began backing up a great distance away at a town called Adam, which is near Zarethan. And the water below that point flowed on to the Dead Sea¨ç until the riverbed was dry. Then all the people crossed over near the town of Jericho. / ¨ç{Hebrew the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea}
06Jos 3:17 Meanwhile, the priests who were carrying the Ark of the LORD's Covenant stood on dry ground in the middle of the riverbed as the people passed by. They waited there until the whole nation of Israel had crossed the Jordan on dry ground.
06Jos 4:1 When all the people had crossed the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua,
06Jos 4:2 "Now choose twelve men, one from each tribe.
06Jos 4:3 Tell them, 'Take twelve stones from the very place where the priests are standing in the middle of the Jordan. Carry them out and pile them up at the place where you will camp tonight.'"
06Jos 4:4 So Joshua called together the twelve men he had chosen - one from each of the tribes of Israel.
06Jos 4:5 He told them, "Go into the middle of the Jordan, in front of the Ark of the LORD your God. Each of you must pick up one stone and carry it out on your shoulder - twelve stones in all, one for each of the twelve tribes of Israel.
06Jos 4:6 We will use these stones to build a memorial. In the future your children will ask you, 'What do these stones mean?'
06Jos 4:7 Then you can tell them, 'They remind us that the Jordan River stopped flowing when the Ark of the LORD's Covenant went across.' These stones will stand as a memorial among the people of Israel forever."
06Jos 4:8 So the men did as Joshua had commanded them. They took twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan River, one for each tribe, just as the LORD had told Joshua. They carried them to the place where they camped for the night and constructed the memorial there.
06Jos 4:9 Joshua also set up another pile of twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan, at the place where the priests who carried the Ark of the Covenant were standing. And they are there to this day.
06Jos 4:10 The priests who were carrying the Ark stood in the middle of the river until all of the LORD's commands that Moses had given to Joshua were carried out. Meanwhile, the people hurried across the riverbed.
06Jos 4:11 And when everyone was safely on the other side, the priests crossed over with the Ark of the LORD as the people watched.
06Jos 4:12 The armed warriors from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh led the Israelites across the Jordan, just as Moses had directed.
06Jos 4:13 These armed men - about 40,000 strong - were ready for battle, and the LORD was with them as they crossed over to the plains of Jericho.
06Jos 4:14 That day the LORD made Joshua a great leader in the eyes of all the Israelites, and for the rest of his life they revered him as much as they had revered Moses.
06Jos 4:15 The LORD had said to Joshua,
06Jos 4:16 "Command the priests carrying the Ark of the Covenant¨ç to come up out of the riverbed." / ¨ç{Hebrew Ark of the Testimony}
06Jos 4:17 So Joshua gave the command.
06Jos 4:18 As soon as the priests carrying the Ark of the LORD's Covenant came up out of the riverbed and their feet were on high ground, the water of the Jordan returned and overflowed its banks as before.
06Jos 4:19 The people crossed the Jordan on the tenth day of the first month¨ç. Then they camped at Gilgal, just east of Jericho. / ¨ç{This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late March, April, or early May}
06Jos 4:20 It was there at Gilgal that Joshua piled up the twelve stones taken from the Jordan River.
06Jos 4:21 Then Joshua said to the Israelites, "In the future your children will ask, 'What do these stones mean?'
06Jos 4:22 Then you can tell them, 'This is where the Israelites crossed the Jordan on dry ground.'
06Jos 4:23 For the LORD your God dried up the river right before your eyes, and he kept it dry until you were all across, just as he did at the Red Sea¨ç when he dried it up until we had all crossed over. / ¨ç{Hebrew sea of reeds}
06Jos 4:24 He did this so all the nations of the earth might know that the LORD's hand is powerful, and so you might fear the LORD your God forever."
06Jos 5:1 When all the Amorite kings west of the Jordan and all the Canaanite kings who lived along the Mediterranean coast¨ç heard how the LORD had dried up the Jordan River so the people of Israel could cross, they lost heart and were paralyzed with fear because of them. / ¨ç{Hebrew along the sea}
06Jos 5:2 At that time the LORD told Joshua, "Make flint knives and circumcise this second generation of Israelites¨ç." / ¨ç{Or circumcise the Israelites a second time}
06Jos 5:3 So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the entire male population of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth¨ç. / ¨ç{Gibeath-haaraloth means "hill of foreskins"}
06Jos 5:4 Joshua had to circumcise them because all the men who were old enough to fight in battle when they left Egypt had died in the wilderness.
06Jos 5:5 Those who left Egypt had all been circumcised, but none of those born after the Exodus, during the years in the wilderness, had been circumcised.
06Jos 5:6 The Israelites had traveled in the wilderness for forty years until all the men who were old enough to fight in battle when they left Egypt had died. For they had disobeyed the LORD, and the LORD vowed he would not let them enter the land he had sworn to give us - a land flowing with milk and honey.
06Jos 5:7 So Joshua circumcised their sons - those who had grown up to take their fathers' places - for they had not been circumcised on the way to the Promised Land.
06Jos 5:8 After all the males had been circumcised, they rested in the camp until they were healed.
06Jos 5:9 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Today I have rolled away the shame of your slavery in Egypt." So that place has been called Gilgal¨ç to this day. / ¨ç{Gilgal sounds like the Hebrew word galal, meaning "to roll"}
06Jos 5:10 While the Israelites were camped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they celebrated Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the first month¨ç. / ¨ç{This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late March, April, or early May}
06Jos 5:11 The very next day they began to eat unleavened bread and roasted grain harvested from the land.
06Jos 5:12 No manna appeared on the day they first ate from the crops of the land, and it was never seen again. So from that time on the Israelites ate from the crops of Canaan.
06Jos 5:13 When Joshua was near the town of Jericho, he looked up and saw a man standing in front of him with sword in hand. Joshua went up to him and demanded, "Are you friend or foe?"
06Jos 5:14 "Neither one," he replied. "I am the commander of the LORD's army." At this, Joshua fell with his face to the ground in reverence. "I am at your command," Joshua said. "What do you want your servant to do?"
06Jos 5:15 The commander of the LORD's army replied, "Take off your sandals, for the place where you are standing is holy." And Joshua did as he was told.
06Jos 6:1 Now the gates of Jericho were tightly shut because the people were afraid of the Israelites. No one was allowed to go out or in.
06Jos 6:2 But the LORD said to Joshua, "I have given you Jericho, its king, and all its strong warriors.
06Jos 6:3 You and your fighting men should march around the town once a day for six days.
06Jos 6:4 Seven priests will walk ahead of the Ark, each carrying a ram's horn. On the seventh day you are to march around the town seven times, with the priests blowing the horns.
06Jos 6:5 When you hear the priests give one long blast on the rams' horns, have all the people shout as loud as they can. Then the walls of the town will collapse, and the people can charge straight into the town."
06Jos 6:6 So Joshua called together the priests and said, "Take up the Ark of the LORD's Covenant, and assign seven priests to walk in front of it, each carrying a ram's horn."
06Jos 6:7 Then he gave orders to the people£º "March around the town, and the armed men will lead the way in front of the Ark of the LORD."
06Jos 6:8 After Joshua spoke to the people, the seven priests with the rams' horns started marching in the presence of the LORD, blowing the horns as they marched. And the Ark of the LORD's Covenant followed behind them.
06Jos 6:9 Some of the armed men marched in front of the priests with the horns and some behind the Ark, with the priests continually blowing the horns.
06Jos 6:10 "Do not shout; do not even talk," Joshua commanded. "Not a single word from any of you until I tell you to shout. Then shout!"
06Jos 6:11 So the Ark of the LORD was carried around the town once that day, and then everyone returned to spend the night in the camp.
06Jos 6:12 Joshua got up early the next morning, and the priests again carried the Ark of the LORD.
06Jos 6:13 The seven priests with the rams' horns marched in front of the Ark of the LORD, blowing their horns. Again the armed men marched both in front of the priests with the horns and behind the Ark of the LORD. All this time the priests were blowing their horns.
06Jos 6:14 On the second day they again marched around the town once and returned to the camp. They followed this pattern for six days.
06Jos 6:15 On the seventh day the Israelites got up at dawn and marched around the town as they had done before. But this time they went around the town seven times.
06Jos 6:16 The seventh time around, as the priests sounded the long blast on their horns, Joshua commanded the people, "Shout! For the LORD has given you the town!
06Jos 6:17 Jericho and everything in it must be completely destroyed¨ç as an offering to the LORD. Only Rahab the prostitute and the others in her house will be spared, for she protected our spies. / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; similarly in 6.18, 21}
06Jos 6:18 "Do not take any of the things set apart for destruction, or you yourselves will be completely destroyed, and you will bring trouble on the camp of Israel.
06Jos 6:19 Everything made from silver, gold, bronze, or iron is sacred to the LORD and must be brought into his treasury."
06Jos 6:20 When the people heard the sound of the rams' horns, they shouted as loud as they could. Suddenly, the walls of Jericho collapsed, and the Israelites charged straight into the town and captured it.
06Jos 6:21 They completely destroyed everything in it with their swords - men and women, young and old, cattle, sheep, goats, and donkeys.
06Jos 6:22 Meanwhile, Joshua said to the two spies, "Keep your promise. Go to the prostitute's house and bring her out, along with all her family."
06Jos 6:23 The men who had been spies went in and brought out Rahab, her father, mother, brothers, and all the other relatives who were with her. They moved her whole family to a safe place near the camp of Israel.
06Jos 6:24 Then the Israelites burned the town and everything in it. Only the things made from silver, gold, bronze, or iron were kept for the treasury of the LORD's house.
06Jos 6:25 So Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute and her relatives who were with her in the house, because she had hidden the spies Joshua sent to Jericho. And she lives among the Israelites to this day.
06Jos 6:26 At that time Joshua invoked this curse£º "May the curse of the LORD fall on anyone who tries to rebuild the town of Jericho. At the cost of his firstborn son, he will lay its foundation. At the cost of his youngest son, he will set up its gates."
06Jos 6:27 So the LORD was with Joshua, and his reputation spread throughout the land.
06Jos 7:1 But Israel violated the instructions about the things set apart for the LORD¨ç. A man named Achan had stolen some of these dedicated things, so the LORD was very angry with the Israelites. Achan was the son of Carmi, a descendant of Zimri¨è son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah. / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; similarly in 7.11, 12, 13, 15} ¨è{As in parallel text at 1 Chr 2.6; Hebrew reads Zabdi. Also in 7.17, 18}
06Jos 7:2 Joshua sent some of his men from Jericho to spy out the town of Ai, east of Bethel, near Beth-aven.
06Jos 7:3 When they returned, they told Joshua, "There's no need for all of us to go up there; it won't take more than two or three thousand men to attack Ai. Since there are so few of them, don't make all our people struggle to go up there."
06Jos 7:4 So approximately 3,000 warriors were sent, but they were soundly defeated. The men of Ai
06Jos 7:5 chased the Israelites from the town gate as far as the quarries¨ç, and they killed about thirty-six who were retreating down the slope. The Israelites were paralyzed with fear at this turn of events, and their courage melted away. / ¨ç{Or as far as Shebarim}
06Jos 7:6 Joshua and the elders of Israel tore their clothing in dismay, threw dust on their heads, and bowed face down to the ground before the Ark of the LORD until evening.
06Jos 7:7 Then Joshua cried out, "Oh, Sovereign LORD, why did you bring us across the Jordan River if you are going to let the Amorites kill us? If only we had been content to stay on the other side!
06Jos 7:8 Lord, what can I say now that Israel has fled from its enemies?
06Jos 7:9 For when the Canaanites and all the other people living in the land hear about it, they will surround us and wipe our name off the face of the earth. And then what will happen to the honor of your great name?"
06Jos 7:10 But the LORD said to Joshua, "Get up! Why are you lying on your face like this?
06Jos 7:11 Israel has sinned and broken my covenant! They have stolen some of the things that I commanded must be set apart for me. And they have not only stolen them but have lied about it and hidden the things among their own belongings.
06Jos 7:12 That is why the Israelites are running from their enemies in defeat. For now Israel itself has been set apart for destruction. I will not remain with you any longer unless you destroy the things among you that were set apart for destruction.
06Jos 7:13 "Get up! Command the people to purify themselves in preparation for tomorrow. For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º Hidden among you, O Israel, are things set apart for the LORD. You will never defeat your enemies until you remove these things from among you.
06Jos 7:14 "In the morning you must present yourselves by tribes, and the LORD will point out the tribe to which the guilty man belongs. That tribe must come forward with its clans, and the LORD will point out the guilty clan. That clan will then come forward, and the LORD will point out the guilty family. Finally, each member of the guilty family must come forward one by one.
06Jos 7:15 The one who has stolen what was set apart for destruction will himself be burned with fire, along with everything he has, for he has broken the covenant of the LORD and has done a horrible thing in Israel."
06Jos 7:16 Early the next morning Joshua brought the tribes of Israel before the LORD, and the tribe of Judah was singled out.
06Jos 7:17 Then the clans of Judah came forward, and the clan of Zerah was singled out. Then the families of Zerah came forward, and the family of Zimri was singled out.
06Jos 7:18 Every member of Zimri's family was brought forward person by person, and Achan was singled out.
06Jos 7:19 Then Joshua said to Achan, "My son, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, by telling the truth. Make your confession and tell me what you have done. Don't hide it from me."
06Jos 7:20 Achan replied, "It is true! I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel.
06Jos 7:21 Among the plunder I saw a beautiful robe from Babylon¨ç, 200 silver coins¨è, and a bar of gold weighing more than a pound¨é. I wanted them so much that I took them. They are hidden in the ground beneath my tent, with the silver buried deeper than the rest." / ¨ç{Hebrew Shinar} ¨è{Hebrew 200 shekels of silver, about 5 pounds or 2.3 kilograms in weight} ¨é{Hebrew 50 shekels, about 20 ounces or 570 grams in weight}
06Jos 7:22 So Joshua sent some men to make a search. They ran to the tent and found the stolen goods hidden there, just as Achan had said, with the silver buried beneath the rest.
06Jos 7:23 They took the things from the tent and brought them to Joshua and all the Israelites. Then they laid them on the ground in the presence of the LORD.
06Jos 7:24 Then Joshua and all the Israelites took Achan, the silver, the robe, the bar of gold, his sons, daughters, cattle, donkeys, sheep, goats, tent, and everything he had, and they brought them to the valley of Achor.
06Jos 7:25 Then Joshua said to Achan, "Why have you brought trouble on us? The LORD will now bring trouble on you." And all the Israelites stoned Achan and his family and burned their bodies.
06Jos 7:26 They piled a great heap of stones over Achan, which remains to this day. That is why the place has been called the Valley of Trouble¨ç ever since. So the LORD was no longer angry. / ¨ç{Hebrew valley of Achor}
06Jos 8:1 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid or discouraged. Take all your fighting men and attack Ai, for I have given you the king of Ai, his people, his town, and his land.
06Jos 8:2 You will destroy them as you destroyed Jericho and its king. But this time you may keep the plunder and the livestock for yourselves. Set an ambush behind the town."
06Jos 8:3 So Joshua and all the fighting men set out to attack Ai. Joshua chose 30,000 of his best warriors and sent them out at night
06Jos 8:4 with these orders£º "Hide in ambush close behind the town and be ready for action.
06Jos 8:5 When our main army attacks, the men of Ai will come out to fight as they did before, and we will run away from them.
06Jos 8:6 We will let them chase us until we have drawn them away from the town. For they will say, 'The Israelites are running away from us as they did before.' Then, while we are running from them,
06Jos 8:7 you will jump up from your ambush and take possession of the town, for the LORD your God will give it to you.
06Jos 8:8 Set the town on fire, as the LORD has commanded. You have your orders."
06Jos 8:9 So they left and went to the place of ambush between Bethel and the west side of Ai. But Joshua remained among the people in the camp that night.
06Jos 8:10 Early the next morning Joshua roused his men and started toward Ai, accompanied by the elders of Israel.
06Jos 8:11 All the fighting men who were with Joshua marched in front of the town and camped on the north side of Ai, with a valley between them and the town.
06Jos 8:12 That night Joshua sent 5,000 men to lie in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the town.
06Jos 8:13 So they stationed the main army north of the town and the ambush west of the town. Joshua himself spent that night in the valley.
06Jos 8:14 When the king of Ai saw the Israelites across the valley, he and all his army hurried out early in the morning and attacked the Israelites at a place overlooking the Jordan Valley¨ç. But he didn't realize there was an ambush behind the town. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Arabah}
06Jos 8:15 Joshua and the Israelite army fled toward the wilderness as though they were badly beaten.
06Jos 8:16 Then all the men in the town were called out to chase after them. In this way, they were lured away from the town.
06Jos 8:17 There was not a man left in Ai or Bethel¨ç who did not chase after the Israelites, and the town was left wide open. / ¨ç{Some manuscripts lack or Bethel}
06Jos 8:18 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Point the spear in your hand toward Ai, for I will hand the town over to you." Joshua did as he was commanded.
06Jos 8:19 As soon as Joshua gave this signal, all the men in ambush jumped up from their position and poured into the town. They quickly captured it and set it on fire.
06Jos 8:20 When the men of Ai looked behind them, smoke from the town was filling the sky, and they had nowhere to go. For the Israelites who had fled in the direction of the wilderness now turned on their pursuers.
06Jos 8:21 When Joshua and all the other Israelites saw that the ambush had succeeded and that smoke was rising from the town, they turned and attacked the men of Ai.
06Jos 8:22 Meanwhile, the Israelites who were inside the town came out and attacked the enemy from the rear. So the men of Ai were caught in the middle, with Israelite fighters on both sides. Israel attacked them, and not a single person survived or escaped.
06Jos 8:23 Only the king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua.
06Jos 8:24 When the Israelite army finished chasing and killing all the men of Ai in the open fields, they went back and finished off everyone inside.
06Jos 8:25 So the entire population of Ai, including men and women, was wiped out that day - 12,000 in all.
06Jos 8:26 For Joshua kept holding out his spear until everyone who had lived in Ai was completely destroyed¨ç. / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering}
06Jos 8:27 Only the livestock and the treasures of the town were not destroyed, for the Israelites kept these as plunder for themselves, as the LORD had commanded Joshua.
06Jos 8:28 So Joshua burned the town of Ai¨ç, and it became a permanent mound of ruins, desolate to this very day. / ¨ç{Ai means "ruin"}
06Jos 8:29 Joshua impaled the king of Ai on a sharpened pole and left him there until evening. At sunset the Israelites took down the body, as Joshua commanded, and threw it in front of the town gate. They piled a great heap of stones over him that can still be seen today.
06Jos 8:30 Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal.
06Jos 8:31 He followed the commands that Moses the LORD's servant had written in the Book of Instruction£º "Make me an altar from stones that are uncut and have not been shaped with iron tools."¨ç Then on the altar they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD. / ¨ç{Exod 20.25; Deut 27.5-6}
06Jos 8:32 And as the Israelites watched, Joshua copied onto the stones of the altar¨ç the instructions Moses had given them. / ¨ç{Hebrew onto the stones}
06Jos 8:33 Then all the Israelites - foreigners and native-born alike - along with the elders, officers, and judges, were divided into two groups. One group stood in front of Mount Gerizim, the other in front of Mount Ebal. Each group faced the other, and between them stood the Levitical priests carrying the Ark of the LORD's Covenant. This was all done according to the commands that Moses, the servant of the LORD, had previously given for blessing the people of Israel.
06Jos 8:34 Joshua then read to them all the blessings and curses Moses had written in the Book of Instruction.
06Jos 8:35 Every word of every command that Moses had ever given was read to the entire assembly of Israel, including the women and children and the foreigners who lived among them.
06Jos 9:1 Now all the kings west of the Jordan River heard about what had happened. These were the kings of the Hittites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, who lived in the hill country, in the western foothills¨ç, and along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea¨è as far north as the Lebanon mountains. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Shephelah} ¨è{Hebrew the Great Sea}
06Jos 9:2 These kings combined their armies to fight as one against Joshua and the Israelites.
06Jos 9:3 But when the people of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai,
06Jos 9:4 they resorted to deception to save themselves. They sent ambassadors to Joshua, loading their donkeys with weathered saddlebags and old, patched wineskins.
06Jos 9:5 They put on worn-out, patched sandals and ragged clothes. And the bread they took with them was dry and moldy.
06Jos 9:6 When they arrived at the camp of Israel at Gilgal, they told Joshua and the men of Israel, "We have come from a distant land to ask you to make a peace treaty with us."
06Jos 9:7 The Israelites replied to these Hivites, "How do we know you don't live nearby? For if you do, we cannot make a treaty with you."
06Jos 9:8 They replied, "We are your servants." "But who are you?" Joshua demanded. "Where do you come from?"
06Jos 9:9 They answered, "Your servants have come from a very distant country. We have heard of the might of the LORD your God and of all he did in Egypt.
06Jos 9:10 We have also heard what he did to the two Amorite kings east of the Jordan River - King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan (who lived in Ashtaroth).
06Jos 9:11 So our elders and all our people instructed us, 'Take supplies for a long journey. Go meet with the people of Israel and tell them, "We are your servants; please make a treaty with us."'
06Jos 9:12 "This bread was hot from the ovens when we left our homes. But now, as you can see, it is dry and moldy.
06Jos 9:13 These wineskins were new when we filled them, but now they are old and split open. And our clothing and sandals are worn out from our very long journey."
06Jos 9:14 So the Israelites examined their food, but they did not consult the LORD.
06Jos 9:15 Then Joshua made a peace treaty with them and guaranteed their safety, and the leaders of the community ratified their agreement with a binding oath.
06Jos 9:16 Three days after making the treaty, they learned that these people actually lived nearby!
06Jos 9:17 The Israelites set out at once to investigate and reached their towns in three days. The names of these towns were Gibeon, Kephirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim.
06Jos 9:18 But the Israelites did not attack the towns, for the Israelite leaders had made a vow to them in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel. The people of Israel grumbled against their leaders because of the treaty.
06Jos 9:19 But the leaders replied, "Since we have sworn an oath in the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel, we cannot touch them.
06Jos 9:20 This is what we must do. We must let them live, for divine anger would come upon us if we broke our oath.
06Jos 9:21 Let them live." So they made them woodcutters and water carriers for the entire community, as the Israelite leaders directed.
06Jos 9:22 Joshua called together the Gibeonites and said, "Why did you lie to us? Why did you say that you live in a distant land when you live right here among us?
06Jos 9:23 May you be cursed! From now on you will always be servants who cut wood and carry water for the house of my God."
06Jos 9:24 They replied, "We did it because we - your servants - were clearly told that the LORD your God commanded his servant Moses to give you this entire land and to destroy all the people living in it. So we feared greatly for our lives because of you. That is why we have done this.
06Jos 9:25 Now we are at your mercy - do to us whatever you think is right."
06Jos 9:26 So Joshua did not allow the people of Israel to kill them.
06Jos 9:27 But that day he made the Gibeonites the woodcutters and water carriers for the community of Israel and for the altar of the LORD - wherever the LORD would choose to build it. And that is what they do to this day.
06Jos 10:1 Adoni-zedek, king of Jerusalem, heard that Joshua had captured and completely destroyed¨ç Ai and killed its king, just as he had destroyed the town of Jericho and killed its king. He also learned that the Gibeonites had made peace with Israel and were now their allies. / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; also in 10.28, 35, 37, 39, 40}
06Jos 10:2 He and his people became very afraid when they heard all this because Gibeon was a large town - as large as the royal cities and larger than Ai. And the Gibeonite men were strong warriors.
06Jos 10:3 So King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem sent messengers to several other kings£º Hoham of Hebron, Piram of Jarmuth, Japhia of Lachish, and Debir of Eglon.
06Jos 10:4 "Come and help me destroy Gibeon," he urged them, "for they have made peace with Joshua and the people of Israel."
06Jos 10:5 So these five Amorite kings combined their armies for a united attack. They moved all their troops into place and attacked Gibeon.
06Jos 10:6 The men of Gibeon quickly sent messengers to Joshua at his camp in Gilgal. "Don't abandon your servants now!" they pleaded. "Come at once! Save us! Help us! For all the Amorite kings who live in the hill country have joined forces to attack us."
06Jos 10:7 So Joshua and his entire army, including his best warriors, left Gilgal and set out for Gibeon.
06Jos 10:8 "Do not be afraid of them," the LORD said to Joshua, "for I have given you victory over them. Not a single one of them will be able to stand up to you."
06Jos 10:9 Joshua traveled all night from Gilgal and took the Amorite armies by surprise.
06Jos 10:10 The LORD threw them into a panic, and the Israelites slaughtered great numbers of them at Gibeon. Then the Israelites chased the enemy along the road to Beth-horon, killing them all along the way to Azekah and Makkedah.
06Jos 10:11 As the Amorites retreated down the road from Beth-horon, the LORD destroyed them with a terrible hailstorm from heaven that continued until they reached Azekah. The hail killed more of the enemy than the Israelites killed with the sword.
06Jos 10:12 On the day the LORD gave the Israelites victory over the Amorites, Joshua prayed to the LORD in front of all the people of Israel. He said, "Let the sun stand still over Gibeon, and the moon over the valley of Aijalon."
06Jos 10:13 So the sun stood still and the moon stayed in place until the nation of Israel had defeated its enemies. Is this event not recorded in The Book of Jashar¨ç? The sun stayed in the middle of the sky, and it did not set as on a normal day¨è. / ¨ç{Or The Book of the Upright} ¨è{Or did not set for about a whole day}
06Jos 10:14 There has never been a day like this one before or since, when the LORD answered such a prayer. Surely the LORD fought for Israel that day!
06Jos 10:15 Then Joshua and the Israelite army returned to their camp at Gilgal.
06Jos 10:16 During the battle the five kings escaped and hid in a cave at Makkedah.
06Jos 10:17 When Joshua heard that they had been found,
06Jos 10:18 he issued this command£º "Cover the opening of the cave with large rocks, and place guards at the entrance to keep the kings inside.
06Jos 10:19 The rest of you continue chasing the enemy and cut them down from the rear. Don't give them a chance to get back to their towns, for the LORD your God has given you victory over them."
06Jos 10:20 So Joshua and the Israelite army continued the slaughter and completely crushed the enemy. They totally wiped out the five armies except for a tiny remnant that managed to reach their fortified towns.
06Jos 10:21 Then the Israelites returned safely to Joshua in the camp at Makkedah. After that, no one dared to speak even a word against Israel.
06Jos 10:22 Then Joshua said, "Remove the rocks covering the opening of the cave, and bring the five kings to me."
06Jos 10:23 So they brought the five kings out of the cave - the kings of Jerusalem, Hebron, Jarmuth, Lachish, and Eglon.
06Jos 10:24 When they brought them out, Joshua told the commanders of his army, "Come and put your feet on the kings' necks." And they did as they were told.
06Jos 10:25 "Don't ever be afraid or discouraged," Joshua told his men. "Be strong and courageous, for the LORD is going to do this to all of your enemies."
06Jos 10:26 Then Joshua killed each of the five kings and impaled them on five sharpened poles, where they hung until evening.
06Jos 10:27 As the sun was going down, Joshua gave instructions for the bodies of the kings to be taken down from the poles and thrown into the cave where they had been hiding. Then they covered the opening of the cave with a pile of large rocks, which remains to this very day.
06Jos 10:28 That same day Joshua captured and destroyed the town of Makkedah. He killed everyone in it, including the king, leaving no survivors. He destroyed them all, and he killed the king of Makkedah as he had killed the king of Jericho.
06Jos 10:29 Then Joshua and the Israelites went to Libnah and attacked it.
06Jos 10:30 There, too, the LORD gave them the town and its king. He killed everyone in it, leaving no survivors. Then Joshua killed the king of Libnah as he had killed the king of Jericho.
06Jos 10:31 From Libnah, Joshua and the Israelites went to Lachish and attacked it.
06Jos 10:32 Here again, the LORD gave them Lachish. Joshua took it on the second day and killed everyone in it, just as he had done at Libnah.
06Jos 10:33 During the attack on Lachish, King Horam of Gezer arrived with his army to help defend the town. But Joshua's men killed him and his army, leaving no survivors.
06Jos 10:34 Then Joshua and the Israelite army went on to Eglon and attacked it.
06Jos 10:35 They captured it that day and killed everyone in it. He completely destroyed everyone, just as he had done at Lachish.
06Jos 10:36 From Eglon, Joshua and the Israelite army went up to Hebron and attacked it.
06Jos 10:37 They captured the town and killed everyone in it, including its king, leaving no survivors. They did the same thing to all of its surrounding villages. And just as he had done at Eglon, he completely destroyed the entire population.
06Jos 10:38 Then Joshua and the Israelites turned back and attacked Debir.
06Jos 10:39 He captured the town, its king, and all of its surrounding villages. He completely destroyed everyone in it, leaving no survivors. He did to Debir and its king just what he had done to Hebron and to Libnah and its king.
06Jos 10:40 So Joshua conquered the whole region - the kings and people of the hill country, the Negev, the western foothills¨ç, and the mountain slopes. He completely destroyed everyone in the land, leaving no survivors, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Shephelah}
06Jos 10:41 Joshua slaughtered them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza and from the region around the town of Goshen up to Gibeon.
06Jos 10:42 Joshua conquered all these kings and their land in a single campaign, for the LORD, the God of Israel, was fighting for his people.
06Jos 10:43 Then Joshua and the Israelite army returned to their camp at Gilgal.
06Jos 11:1 When King Jabin of Hazor heard what had happened, he sent messages to the following kings£º King Jobab of Madon; the king of Shimron; the king of Acshaph;
06Jos 11:2 all the kings of the northern hill country; the kings in the Jordan Valley south of Galilee¨ç; the kings in the Galilean foothills¨è; the kings of Naphoth-dor on the west; / ¨ç{Hebrew in the Arabah south of Kinnereth} ¨è{Hebrew the Shephelah; also in 11.16}
06Jos 11:3 the kings of Canaan, both east and west; the kings of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites in the towns on the slopes of Mount Hermon in the land of Mizpah.
06Jos 11:4 All these kings came out to fight. Their combined armies formed a vast horde. And with all their horses and chariots, they covered the landscape like the sand on the seashore.
06Jos 11:5 The kings joined forces and established their camp around the water near Merom to fight against Israel.
06Jos 11:6 Then the LORD said to Joshua, "Do not be afraid of them. By this time tomorrow I will hand all of them over to Israel as dead men. Then you must cripple their horses and burn their chariots."
06Jos 11:7 So Joshua and all his fighting men traveled to the water near Merom and attacked suddenly.
06Jos 11:8 And the LORD gave them victory over their enemies. The Israelites chased them as far as Greater Sidon and Misrephoth-maim, and eastward into the valley of Mizpah, until not one enemy warrior was left alive.
06Jos 11:9 Then Joshua crippled the horses and burned all the chariots, as the LORD had instructed.
06Jos 11:10 Joshua then turned back and captured Hazor and killed its king. (Hazor had at one time been the capital of all these kingdoms.)
06Jos 11:11 The Israelites completely destroyed¨ç every living thing in the city, leaving no survivors. Not a single person was spared. And then Joshua burned the city. / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; also in 11.12, 20, 21}
06Jos 11:12 Joshua slaughtered all the other kings and their people, completely destroying them, just as Moses, the servant of the LORD, had commanded.
06Jos 11:13 But the Israelites did not burn any of the towns built on mounds except Hazor, which Joshua burned.
06Jos 11:14 And the Israelites took all the plunder and livestock of the ravaged towns for themselves. But they killed all the people, leaving no survivors.
06Jos 11:15 As the LORD had commanded his servant Moses, so Moses commanded Joshua. And Joshua did as he was told, carefully obeying all the commands that the LORD had given to Moses.
06Jos 11:16 So Joshua conquered the entire region - the hill country, the entire Negev, the whole area around the town of Goshen, the western foothills, the Jordan Valley¨ç, the mountains of Israel, and the Galilean foothills. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Shephelah, the Arabah}
06Jos 11:17 The Israelite territory now extended all the way from Mount Halak, which leads up to Seir in the south, as far north as Baal-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon in the valley of Lebanon. Joshua killed all the kings of those territories,
06Jos 11:18 waging war for a long time to accomplish this.
06Jos 11:19 No one in this region made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites of Gibeon. All the others were defeated.
06Jos 11:20 For the LORD hardened their hearts and caused them to fight the Israelites. So they were completely destroyed without mercy, as the LORD had commanded Moses.
06Jos 11:21 During this period Joshua destroyed all the descendants of Anak, who lived in the hill country of Hebron, Debir, Anab, and the entire hill country of Judah and Israel. He killed them all and completely destroyed their towns.
06Jos 11:22 None of the descendants of Anak were left in all the land of Israel, though some still remained in Gaza, Gath, and Ashdod.
06Jos 11:23 So Joshua took control of the entire land, just as the LORD had instructed Moses. He gave it to the people of Israel as their special possession, dividing the land among the tribes. So the land finally had rest from war.
06Jos 12:1 These are the kings east of the Jordan River who had been killed by the Israelites and whose land was taken. Their territory extended from the Arnon Gorge to Mount Hermon and included all the land east of the Jordan Valley¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Arabah; also in 12.3, 8}
06Jos 12:2 King Sihon of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, was defeated. His kingdom included Aroer, on the edge of the Arnon Gorge, and extended from the middle of the Arnon Gorge to the Jabbok River, which serves as a border for the Ammonites. This territory included the southern half of the territory of Gilead.
06Jos 12:3 Sihon also controlled the Jordan Valley and regions to the east - from as far north as the Sea of Galilee to as far south as the Dead Sea¨ç, including the road to Beth-jeshimoth and southward to the slopes of Pisgah. / ¨ç{Hebrew from the Sea of Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah, which is the Salt Sea}
06Jos 12:4 King Og of Bashan, the last of the Rephaites, lived at Ashtaroth and Edrei.
06Jos 12:5 He ruled a territory stretching from Mount Hermon to Salecah in the north and to all of Bashan in the east, and westward to the borders of the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah. This territory included the northern half of Gilead, as far as the boundary of King Sihon of Heshbon.
06Jos 12:6 Moses, the servant of the LORD, and the Israelites had destroyed the people of King Sihon and King Og. And Moses gave their land as a possession to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 12:7 The following is a list of the kings that Joshua and the Israelite armies defeated on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which leads up to Seir. (Joshua gave this land to the tribes of Israel as their possession,
06Jos 12:8 including the hill country, the western foothills¨ç, the Jordan Valley, the mountain slopes, the Judean wilderness, and the Negev. The people who lived in this region were the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites.) These are the kings Israel defeated. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Shephelah}

06Jos 12:22 The king of Kedesh The king of Jokneam in Carmel
06Jos 12:23 The king of Dor in the town of Naphoth-dor¨ç The king of Goyim in Gilgal¨è / ¨ç{Hebrew Naphath-dor, a variant spelling of Naphoth-dor} ¨è{Greek version reads Goyim in Galilee}
06Jos 12:24 The king of Tirzah. In all, thirty-one kings were defeated.
06Jos 13:1 When Joshua was an old man, the LORD said to him, "You are growing old, and much land remains to be conquered.
06Jos 13:2 This is the territory that remains£º all the regions of the Philistines and the Geshurites,
06Jos 13:3 and the larger territory of the Canaanites, extending from the stream of Shihor on the border of Egypt, northward to the boundary of Ekron. It includes the territory of the five Philistine rulers of Gaza, Ashdod, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron. The land of the Avvites
06Jos 13:4 in the south also remains to be conquered. In the north, the following area has not yet been conquered£º all the land of the Canaanites, including Mearah (which belongs to the Sidonians), stretching northward to Aphek on the border of the Amorites;
06Jos 13:5 the land of the Gebalites and all of the Lebanon mountain area to the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to Lebo-hamath;
06Jos 13:6 and all the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, including all the land of the Sidonians."I myself will drive these people out of the land ahead of the Israelites. So be sure to give this land to Israel as a special possession, just as I have commanded you.
06Jos 13:7 Include all this territory as Israel's possession when you divide this land among the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh."
06Jos 13:8 Half the tribe of Manasseh and the tribes of Reuben and Gad had already received their grants of land on the east side of the Jordan, for Moses, the servant of the LORD, had previously assigned this land to them.
06Jos 13:9 Their territory extended from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Gorge (including the town in the middle of the gorge) to the plain beyond Medeba, as far as Dibon.
06Jos 13:10 It also included all the towns of King Sihon of the Amorites, who had reigned in Heshbon, and extended as far as the borders of Ammon.
06Jos 13:11 It included Gilead, the territory of the kingdoms of Geshur and Maacah, all of Mount Hermon, all of Bashan as far as Salecah,
06Jos 13:12 and all the territory of King Og of Bashan, who had reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei. King Og was the last of the Rephaites, for Moses had attacked them and driven them out.
06Jos 13:13 But the Israelites failed to drive out the people of Geshur and Maacah, so they continue to live among the Israelites to this day.
06Jos 13:14 Moses did not assign any allotment of land to the tribe of Levi. Instead, as the LORD had promised them, their allotment came from the offerings burned on the altar to the LORD, the God of Israel.
06Jos 13:15 Moses had assigned the following area to the clans of the tribe of Reuben.
06Jos 13:16 Their territory extended from Aroer on the edge of the Arnon Gorge (including the town in the middle of the gorge) to the plain beyond Medeba.
06Jos 13:17 It included Heshbon and the other towns on the plain - Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon,
06Jos 13:18 Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath,
06Jos 13:19 Kiriathaim, Sibmah, Zereth-shahar on the hill above the valley,
06Jos 13:20 Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, and Beth-jeshimoth.
06Jos 13:21 The land of Reuben also included all the towns of the plain and the entire kingdom of Sihon. Sihon was the Amorite king who had reigned in Heshbon and was killed by Moses along with the leaders of Midian - Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba - princes living in the region who were allied with Sihon.
06Jos 13:22 The Israelites had also killed Balaam son of Beor, who used magic to tell the future.
06Jos 13:23 The Jordan River marked the western boundary for the tribe of Reuben. The towns and their surrounding villages in this area were given as a homeland to the clans of the tribe of Reuben.
06Jos 13:24 Moses had assigned the following area to the clans of the tribe of Gad.
06Jos 13:25 Their territory included Jazer, all the towns of Gilead, and half of the land of Ammon, as far as the town of Aroer just west of¨ç Rabbah. / ¨ç{Hebrew in front of}
06Jos 13:26 It extended from Heshbon to Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim to the territory of Lo-debar¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew Li-debir, apparently a variant spelling of Lo-debar (compare 2 Sam 9.4; 17.27; Amos 6.13)}
06Jos 13:27 In the valley were Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, Zaphon, and the rest of the kingdom of King Sihon of Heshbon. The western boundary ran along the Jordan River, extended as far north as the tip of the Sea of Galilee¨ç, and then turned eastward. / ¨ç{Hebrew Sea of Kinnereth}
06Jos 13:28 The towns and their surrounding villages in this area were given as a homeland to the clans of the tribe of Gad.
06Jos 13:29 Moses had assigned the following area to the clans of the half-tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 13:30 Their territory extended from Mahanaim, including all of Bashan, all the former kingdom of King Og, and the sixty towns of Jair in Bashan.
06Jos 13:31 It also included half of Gilead and King Og's royal cities of Ashtaroth and Edrei. All this was given to the clans of the descendants of Makir, who was Manasseh's son.
06Jos 13:32 These are the allotments Moses had made while he was on the plains of Moab, across the Jordan River, east of Jericho.
06Jos 13:33 But Moses gave no allotment of land to the tribe of Levi, for the LORD, the God of Israel, had promised that he himself would be their allotment.
06Jos 14:1 The remaining tribes of Israel received land in Canaan as allotted by Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the tribal leaders.
06Jos 14:2 These nine and a half tribes received their grants of land by means of sacred lots, in accordance with the LORD's command through Moses.
06Jos 14:3 Moses had already given a grant of land to the two and a half tribes on the east side of the Jordan River, but he had given the Levites no such allotment.
06Jos 14:4 The descendants of Joseph had become two separate tribes - Manasseh and Ephraim. And the Levites were given no land at all, only towns to live in with surrounding pasturelands for their livestock and all their possessions.
06Jos 14:5 So the land was distributed in strict accordance with the LORD's commands to Moses.
06Jos 14:6 A delegation from the tribe of Judah, led by Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite, came to Joshua at Gilgal. Caleb said to Joshua, "Remember what the LORD said to Moses, the man of God, about you and me when we were at Kadesh-barnea.
06Jos 14:7 I was forty years old when Moses, the servant of the LORD, sent me from Kadesh-barnea to explore the land of Canaan. I returned and gave an honest report,
06Jos 14:8 but my brothers who went with me frightened the people from entering the Promised Land. For my part, I wholeheartedly followed the LORD my God.
06Jos 14:9 So that day Moses solemnly promised me, 'The land of Canaan on which you were just walking will be your grant of land and that of your descendants forever, because you wholeheartedly followed the LORD my God.'
06Jos 14:10 "Now, as you can see, the LORD has kept me alive and well as he promised for all these forty-five years since Moses made this promise - even while Israel wandered in the wilderness. Today I am eighty-five years old.
06Jos 14:11 I am as strong now as I was when Moses sent me on that journey, and I can still travel and fight as well as I could then.
06Jos 14:12 So give me the hill country that the LORD promised me. You will remember that as scouts we found the descendants of Anak living there in great, walled towns. But if the LORD is with me, I will drive them out of the land, just as the LORD said."
06Jos 14:13 So Joshua blessed Caleb son of Jephunneh and gave Hebron to him as his portion of land.
06Jos 14:14 Hebron still belongs to the descendants of Caleb son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite because he wholeheartedly followed the LORD, the God of Israel.
06Jos 14:15 (Previously Hebron had been called Kiriath-arba. It had been named after Arba, a great hero of the descendants of Anak.) And the land had rest from war.
06Jos 15:1 The allotment for the clans of the tribe of Judah reached southward to the border of Edom, as far south as the wilderness of Zin.
06Jos 15:2 The southern boundary began at the south bay of the Dead Sea¨ç, / ¨ç{Hebrew the Salt Sea; also in 15.5}
06Jos 15:3 ran south of Scorpion Pass¨ç into the wilderness of Zin, and then went south of Kadesh-barnea to Hezron. Then it went up to Addar, where it turned toward Karka. / ¨ç{Hebrew Akrabbim}
06Jos 15:4 From there it passed to Azmon until it finally reached the Brook of Egypt, which it followed to the Mediterranean Sea¨ç. This was their¨è southern boundary. / ¨ç{Hebrew the sea; also in 15.11} ¨è{Hebrew your}
06Jos 15:5 The eastern boundary extended along the Dead Sea to the mouth of the Jordan River.The northern boundary began at the bay where the Jordan River empties into the Dead Sea,
06Jos 15:6 went up from there to Beth-hoglah, then proceeded north of Beth-arabah to the Stone of Bohan. (Bohan was Reuben's son.)
06Jos 15:7 From that point it went through the valley of Achor to Debir, turning north toward Gilgal, which is across from the slopes of Adummim on the south side of the valley. From there the boundary extended to the springs at En-shemesh and on to En-rogel.
06Jos 15:8 The boundary then passed through the valley of Ben-Hinnom, along the southern slopes of the Jebusites, where the city of Jerusalem is located. Then it went west to the top of the mountain above the valley of Hinnom, and on up to the northern end of the valley of Rephaim.
06Jos 15:9 From there the boundary extended from the top of the mountain to the spring at the waters of Nephtoah¨ç, and from there to the towns on Mount Ephron. Then it turned toward Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim). / ¨ç{Or the spring at Me-nephtoah}
06Jos 15:10 The boundary circled west of Baalah to Mount Seir, passed along to the town of Kesalon on the northern slope of Mount Jearim, and went down to Beth-shemesh and on to Timnah.
06Jos 15:11 The boundary then proceeded to the slope of the hill north of Ekron, where it turned toward Shikkeron and Mount Baalah. It passed Jabneel and ended at the Mediterranean Sea.
06Jos 15:12 The western boundary was the shoreline of the Mediterranean Sea¨ç. These are the boundaries for the clans of the tribe of Judah. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Great Sea; also in 15.47}
06Jos 15:13 The LORD commanded Joshua to assign some of Judah's territory to Caleb son of Jephunneh. So Caleb was given the town of Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), which had been named after Anak's ancestor.
06Jos 15:14 Caleb drove out the three groups of Anakites - the descendants of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai, the sons of Anak.
06Jos 15:15 From there he went to fight against the people living in the town of Debir (formerly called Kiriath-sepher).
06Jos 15:16 Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the one who attacks and captures Kiriath-sepher."
06Jos 15:17 Othniel, the son of Caleb's brother Kenaz, was the one who conquered it, so Acsah became Othniel's wife.
06Jos 15:18 When Acsah married Othniel, she urged him¨ç to ask her father for a field. As she got down off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What's the matter?" / ¨ç{Some Greek manuscripts read he urged her}
06Jos 15:19 She said, "Give me another gift. You have already given me land in the Negev; now please give me springs of water, too." So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
06Jos 15:20 This was the homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Judah.
06Jos 15:21 The towns of Judah situated along the borders of Edom in the extreme south were Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur,
06Jos 15:22 Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah,
06Jos 15:23 Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,
06Jos 15:24 Ziph, Telem, Bealoth,
06Jos 15:25 Hazor-hadattah, Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor),
06Jos 15:26 Amam, Shema, Moladah,
06Jos 15:27 Hazar-gaddah, Heshmon, Beth-pelet,
06Jos 15:28 Hazar-shual, Beersheba, Biziothiah,
06Jos 15:29 Baalah, Iim, Ezem,
06Jos 15:30 Eltolad, Kesil, Hormah,
06Jos 15:31 Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansannah,
06Jos 15:32 Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon - twenty-nine towns with their surrounding villages.
06Jos 15:33 The following towns situated in the western foothills¨ç were also given to Judah£º Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, / ¨ç{Hebrew the Shephelah}
06Jos 15:34 Zanoah, En-gannim, Tappuah, Enam,
06Jos 15:35 Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah,
06Jos 15:36 Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim - fourteen towns with their surrounding villages.
06Jos 15:37 Also included were Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-gad,
06Jos 15:38 Dilean, Mizpeh, Joktheel,
06Jos 15:39 Lachish, Bozkath, Eglon,
06Jos 15:40 Cabbon, Lahmam, Kitlish,
06Jos 15:41 Gederoth, Beth-dagon, Naamah, and Makkedah - sixteen towns with their surrounding villages.
06Jos 15:42 Besides these, there were Libnah, Ether, Ashan,
06Jos 15:43 Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib,
06Jos 15:44 Keilah, Aczib, and Mareshah - nine towns with their surrounding villages.
06Jos 15:45 The territory of the tribe of Judah also included Ekron and its surrounding settlements and villages.
06Jos 15:46 From Ekron the boundary extended west and included the towns near Ashdod with their surrounding villages.
06Jos 15:47 It also included Ashdod with its surrounding settlements and villages and Gaza with its settlements and villages, as far as the Brook of Egypt and along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea.
06Jos 15:48 Judah also received the following towns in the hill country£º Shamir, Jattir, Socoh,
06Jos 15:49 Dannah, Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir),
06Jos 15:50 Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim,
06Jos 15:51 Goshen, Holon, and Giloh - eleven towns with their surrounding villages.
06Jos 15:52 Also included were the towns of Arab, Dumah, Eshan,
06Jos 15:53 Janim, Beth-tappuah, Aphekah,
06Jos 15:54 Humtah, Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior - nine towns with their surrounding villages.
06Jos 15:55 Besides these, there were Maon, Carmel, Ziph, Juttah,
06Jos 15:56 Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah,
06Jos 15:57 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah - ten towns with their surrounding villages.
06Jos 15:58 In addition, there were Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor,
06Jos 15:59 Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon - six towns with their surrounding villages.
06Jos 15:60 There were also Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim) and Rabbah - two towns with their surrounding villages.
06Jos 15:61 In the wilderness there were the towns of Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah,
06Jos 15:62 Nibshan, the City of Salt, and En-gedi - six towns with their surrounding villages.
06Jos 15:63 But the tribe of Judah could not drive out the Jebusites, who lived in the city of Jerusalem, so the Jebusites live there among the people of Judah to this day.
06Jos 16:1 The allotment for the descendants of Joseph extended from the Jordan River near Jericho, east of the springs of Jericho, through the wilderness and into the hill country of Bethel.
06Jos 16:2 From Bethel (that is, Luz)¨ç it ran over to Ataroth in the territory of the Arkites. / ¨ç{As in Greek version (also see 18.13); Hebrew reads From Bethel to Luz}
06Jos 16:3 Then it descended westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as Lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer and over to the Mediterranean Sea¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew the sea; also in 16.6, 8}
06Jos 16:4 This was the homeland allocated to the families of Joseph's sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.
06Jos 16:5 The following territory was given to the clans of the tribe of Ephraim. The boundary of their homeland began at Ataroth-addar in the east. From there it ran to Upper Beth-horon,
06Jos 16:6 then on to the Mediterranean Sea. From Micmethath on the north, the boundary curved eastward past Taanath-shiloh to the east of Janoah.
06Jos 16:7 From Janoah it turned southward to Ataroth and Naarah, touched Jericho, and ended at the Jordan River.
06Jos 16:8 From Tappuah the boundary extended westward, following the Kanah Ravine to the Mediterranean Sea. This is the homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Ephraim.
06Jos 16:9 In addition, some towns with their surrounding villages in the territory allocated to the half-tribe of Manasseh were set aside for the tribe of Ephraim.
06Jos 16:10 They did not drive the Canaanites out of Gezer, however, so the people of Gezer live as slaves among the people of Ephraim to this day.
06Jos 17:1 The next allotment of land was given to the half-tribe of Manasseh, the descendants of Joseph's older son. Makir, the firstborn son of Manasseh, was the father of Gilead. Because his descendants were experienced soldiers, the regions of Gilead and Bashan on the east side of the Jordan had already been given to them.
06Jos 17:2 So the allotment on the west side of the Jordan was for the remaining families within the clans of the tribe of Manasseh£º Abiezer, Helek, Asriel, Shechem, Hepher, and Shemida. These clans represent the male descendants of Manasseh son of Joseph.
06Jos 17:3 However, Zelophehad, a descendant of Hepher son of Gilead, son of Makir, son of Manasseh, had no sons. He had only daughters, whose names were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.
06Jos 17:4 These women came to Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the Israelite leaders and said, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us a grant of land along with the men of our tribe." So Joshua gave them a grant of land along with their uncles, as the LORD had commanded.
06Jos 17:5 As a result, Manasseh's total allocation came to ten parcels of land, in addition to the land of Gilead and Bashan across the Jordan River,
06Jos 17:6 because the female descendants of Manasseh received a grant of land along with the male descendants. (The land of Gilead was given to the rest of the male descendants of Manasseh.)
06Jos 17:7 The boundary of the tribe of Manasseh extended from the border of Asher to Micmethath, near Shechem. Then the boundary went south from Micmethath to the settlement near the spring of Tappuah.
06Jos 17:8 The land surrounding Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but the town of Tappuah itself, on the border of Manasseh's territory, belonged to the tribe of Ephraim.
06Jos 17:9 From the spring of Tappuah, the boundary of Manasseh followed the Kanah Ravine to the Mediterranean Sea¨ç. Several towns south of the ravine were inside Manasseh's territory, but they actually belonged to the tribe of Ephraim. / ¨ç{Hebrew the sea; also in 17.10}
06Jos 17:10 In general, however, the land south of the ravine belonged to Ephraim, and the land north of the ravine belonged to Manasseh. Manasseh's boundary ran along the northern side of the ravine and ended at the Mediterranean Sea. North of Manasseh was the territory of Asher, and to the east was the territory of Issachar.
06Jos 17:11 The following towns within the territory of Issachar and Asher, however, were given to Manasseh£º Beth-shan¨ç, Ibleam, Dor (that is, Naphoth-dor)¨è, Endor, Taanach, and Megiddo, each with their surrounding settlements. / ¨ç{Hebrew Beth-shean, a variant spelling of Beth-shan; also in 17.16} ¨è{The meaning of the Hebrew here is uncertain}
06Jos 17:12 But the descendants of Manasseh were unable to occupy these towns. They could not drive out the Canaanites who continued to live there.
06Jos 17:13 Later, however, when the Israelites became strong enough, they forced the Canaanites to work as slaves. But they did not drive them out of the land.
06Jos 17:14 The descendants of Joseph came to Joshua and asked, "Why have you given us only one portion of land as our homeland when the LORD has blessed us with so many people?"
06Jos 17:15 Joshua replied, "If there are so many of you, and if the hill country of Ephraim is not large enough for you, clear out land for yourselves in the forest where the Perizzites and Rephaites live."
06Jos 17:16 The descendants of Joseph responded, "It's true that the hill country is not large enough for us. But all the Canaanites in the lowlands have iron chariots, both those in Beth-shan and its surrounding settlements and those in the valley of Jezreel. They are too strong for us."
06Jos 17:17 Then Joshua said to the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, the descendants of Joseph, "Since you are so large and strong, you will be given more than one portion.
06Jos 17:18 The forests of the hill country will be yours as well. Clear as much of the land as you wish, and take possession of its farthest corners. And you will drive out the Canaanites from the valleys, too, even though they are strong and have iron chariots."
06Jos 18:1 Now that the land was under Israelite control, the entire community of Israel gathered at Shiloh and set up the Tabernacle¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew Tent of Meeting}
06Jos 18:2 But there remained seven tribes who had not yet been allotted their grants of land.
06Jos 18:3 Then Joshua asked them, "How long are you going to wait before taking possession of the remaining land the LORD, the God of your ancestors, has given to you?
06Jos 18:4 Select three men from each tribe, and I will send them out to explore the land and map it out. They will then return to me with a written report of their proposed divisions of their new homeland.
06Jos 18:5 Let them divide the land into seven sections, excluding Judah's territory in the south and Joseph's territory in the north.
06Jos 18:6 And when you record the seven divisions of the land and bring them to me, I will cast sacred lots in the presence of the LORD our God to assign land to each tribe.
06Jos 18:7 "The Levites, however, will not receive any allotment of land. Their role as priests of the LORD is their allotment. And the tribes of Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh won't receive any more land, for they have already received their grant of land, which Moses, the servant of the LORD, gave them on the east side of the Jordan River."
06Jos 18:8 As the men started on their way to map out the land, Joshua commanded them, "Go and explore the land and write a description of it. Then return to me, and I will assign the land to the tribes by casting sacred lots here in the presence of the LORD at Shiloh."
06Jos 18:9 The men did as they were told and mapped the entire territory into seven sections, listing the towns in each section. They made a written record and then returned to Joshua in the camp at Shiloh.
06Jos 18:10 And there at Shiloh, Joshua cast sacred lots in the presence of the LORD to determine which tribe should have each section.
06Jos 18:11 The first allotment of land went to the clans of the tribe of Benjamin. It lay between the territory assigned to the tribes of Judah and Joseph.
06Jos 18:12 The northern boundary of Benjamin's land began at the Jordan River, went north of the slope of Jericho, then west through the hill country and the wilderness of Beth-aven.
06Jos 18:13 From there the boundary went south to Luz (that is, Bethel) and proceeded down to Ataroth-addar on the hill that lies south of Lower Beth-horon.
06Jos 18:14 The boundary then made a turn and swung south along the western edge of the hill facing Beth-horon, ending at the village of Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a town belonging to the tribe of Judah. This was the western boundary.
06Jos 18:15 The southern boundary began at the outskirts of Kiriath-jearim. From that western point it ran¨ç to the spring at the waters of Nephtoah¨è, / ¨ç{Or From there it went to Mozah. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain} ¨è{Or the spring at Me-nephtoah}
06Jos 18:16 and down to the base of the mountain beside the valley of Ben-Hinnom, at the northern end of the valley of Rephaim. From there it went down the valley of Hinnom, crossing south of the slope where the Jebusites lived, and continued down to En-rogel.
06Jos 18:17 From En-rogel the boundary proceeded in a northerly direction and came to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth (which is across from the slopes of Adummim). Then it went down to the Stone of Bohan. (Bohan was Reuben's son.)
06Jos 18:18 From there it passed along the north side of the slope overlooking the Jordan Valley¨ç. The border then went down into the valley, / ¨ç{Hebrew overlooking the Arabah, or overlooking Beth-arabah}
06Jos 18:19 ran past the north slope of Beth-hoglah, and ended at the north bay of the Dead Sea¨ç, which is the southern end of the Jordan River. This was the southern boundary. / ¨ç{Hebrew Salt Sea}
06Jos 18:20 The eastern boundary was the Jordan River. These were the boundaries of the homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Benjamin.
06Jos 18:21 These were the towns given to the clans of the tribe of Benjamin. Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keziz,

06Jos 19:9 Their allocation of land came from part of what had been given to Judah because Judah's territory was too large for them. So the tribe of Simeon received an allocation within the territory of Judah.
06Jos 19:10 The third allotment of land went to the clans of the tribe of Zebulun. The boundary of Zebulun's homeland started at Sarid.
06Jos 19:11 From there it went west, going past Maralah, touching Dabbesheth, and proceeding to the brook east of Jokneam.
06Jos 19:12 In the other direction, the boundary went east from Sarid to the border of Kisloth-tabor, and from there to Daberath and up to Japhia.
06Jos 19:13 Then it continued east to Gath-hepher, Eth-kazin, and Rimmon and turned toward Neah.

06Jos 19:34 The western boundary ran past Aznoth-tabor, then to Hukkok, and touched the border of Zebulun in the south, the border of Asher on the west, and the Jordan River¨ç on the east. / ¨ç{Hebrew and Judah at the Jordan River}
06Jos 19:35 The fortified towns included in this territory were Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Kinnereth,

06Jos 19:46 Me-jarkon, Rakkon, and the territory across from Joppa.
06Jos 19:47 But the tribe of Dan had trouble taking possession of their land¨ç, so they attacked the town of Laish¨è. They captured it, slaughtered its people, and settled there. They renamed the town Dan after their ancestor. / ¨ç{Or had trouble holding onto their land} ¨è{Hebrew Leshem, a variant spelling of Laish}
06Jos 19:48 The homeland allocated to the clans of the tribe of Dan included these towns and their surrounding villages.
06Jos 19:49 After all the land was divided among the tribes, the Israelites gave a piece of land to Joshua as his allocation.
06Jos 19:50 For the LORD had said he could have any town he wanted. He chose Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. He rebuilt the town and lived there.
06Jos 19:51 These are the territories that Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the tribal leaders allocated as grants of land to the tribes of Israel by casting sacred lots in the presence of the LORD at the entrance of the Tabernacle¨ç at Shiloh. So the division of the land was completed. / ¨ç{Hebrew Tent of Meeting}
06Jos 20:1 The LORD said to Joshua,
06Jos 20:2 "Now tell the Israelites to designate the cities of refuge, as I instructed Moses.
06Jos 20:3 Anyone who kills another person accidentally and unintentionally can run to one of these cities; they will be places of refuge from relatives seeking revenge for the person who was killed.
06Jos 20:4 "Upon reaching one of these cities, the one who caused the death will appear before the elders at the city gate and present his case. They must allow him to enter the city and give him a place to live among them.
06Jos 20:5 If the relatives of the victim come to avenge the killing, the leaders must not release the slayer to them, for he killed the other person unintentionally and without previous hostility.
06Jos 20:6 But the slayer must stay in that city and be tried by the local assembly, which will render a judgment. And he must continue to live in that city until the death of the high priest who was in office at the time of the accident. After that, he is free to return to his own home in the town from which he fled."
06Jos 20:7 The following cities were designated as cities of refuge£º Kedesh of Galilee, in the hill country of Naphtali; Shechem, in the hill country of Ephraim; and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), in the hill country of Judah.
06Jos 20:8 On the east side of the Jordan River, across from Jericho, the following cities were designated£º Bezer, in the wilderness plain of the tribe of Reuben; Ramoth in Gilead, in the territory of the tribe of Gad; and Golan in Bashan, in the land of the tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 20:9 These cities were set apart for all the Israelites as well as the foreigners living among them. Anyone who accidentally killed another person could take refuge in one of these cities. In this way, they could escape being killed in revenge prior to standing trial before the local assembly.
06Jos 21:1 Then the leaders of the tribe of Levi came to consult with Eleazar the priest, Joshua son of Nun, and the leaders of the other tribes of Israel.
06Jos 21:2 They came to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan and said, "The LORD commanded Moses to give us towns to live in and pasturelands for our livestock."
06Jos 21:3 So by the command of the LORD the people of Israel gave the Levites the following towns and pasturelands out of their own grants of land.
06Jos 21:4 The descendants of Aaron, who were members of the Kohathite clan within the tribe of Levi, were allotted thirteen towns that were originally assigned to the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin.
06Jos 21:5 The other families of the Kohathite clan were allotted ten towns from the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 21:6 The clan of Gershon was allotted thirteen towns from the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.
06Jos 21:7 The clan of Merari was allotted twelve towns from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
06Jos 21:8 So the Israelites obeyed the LORD's command to Moses and assigned these towns and pasturelands to the Levites by casting sacred lots.
06Jos 21:9 The Israelites gave the following towns from the tribes of Judah and Simeon
06Jos 21:10 to the descendants of Aaron, who were members of the Kohathite clan within the tribe of Levi, since the sacred lot fell to them first.
06Jos 21:11 Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), in the hill country of Judah, along with its surrounding pasturelands. (Arba was an ancestor of Anak.)
06Jos 21:12 But the open fields beyond the town and the surrounding villages were given to Caleb son of Jephunneh as his possession.
06Jos 21:13 The following towns with their pasturelands were given to the descendants of Aaron the priest£º Hebron (a city of refuge for those who accidentally killed someone), Libnah,
06Jos 21:14 Jattir, Eshtemoa,
06Jos 21:15 Holon, Debir,
06Jos 21:16 Ain, Juttah, and Beth-shemesh - nine towns from these two tribes.
06Jos 21:17 From the tribe of Benjamin the priests were given the following towns with their pasturelands£º Gibeon, Geba,
06Jos 21:18 Anathoth, and Almon - four towns.
06Jos 21:19 So in all, thirteen towns with their pasturelands were given to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
06Jos 21:20 The rest of the Kohathite clan from the tribe of Levi was allotted the following towns and pasturelands from the tribe of Ephraim.
06Jos 21:21 Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim (a city of refuge for those who accidentally killed someone), Gezer,
06Jos 21:22 Kibzaim, and Beth-horon - four towns.
06Jos 21:23 The following towns and pasturelands were allotted to the priests from the tribe of Dan£º Eltekeh, Gibbethon,
06Jos 21:24 Aijalon, and Gath-rimmon - four towns.
06Jos 21:25 The half-tribe of Manasseh allotted the following towns with their pasturelands to the priests£º Taanach and Gath-rimmon - two towns.
06Jos 21:26 So in all, ten towns with their pasturelands were given to the rest of the Kohathite clan.
06Jos 21:27 The descendants of Gershon, another clan within the tribe of Levi, received the following towns with their pasturelands from the half-tribe of Manasseh£º Golan in Bashan (a city of refuge for those who accidentally killed someone) and Be-eshterah - two towns.
06Jos 21:28 From the tribe of Issachar they received the following towns with their pasturelands£º Kishion, Daberath,
06Jos 21:29 Jarmuth, and En-gannim - four towns.
06Jos 21:30 From the tribe of Asher they received the following towns with their pasturelands£º Mishal, Abdon,
06Jos 21:31 Helkath, and Rehob - four towns.
06Jos 21:32 From the tribe of Naphtali they received the following towns with their pasturelands£º Kedesh in Galilee (a city of refuge for those who accidentally killed someone), Hammoth-dor, and Kartan - three towns.
06Jos 21:33 So in all, thirteen towns with their pasturelands were allotted to the clan of Gershon.
06Jos 21:34 The rest of the Levites - the Merari clan - were given the following towns with their pasturelands from the tribe of Zebulun£º Jokneam, Kartah,
06Jos 21:35 Dimnah, and Nahalal - four towns.
06Jos 21:36 From the tribe of Reuben they received the following towns with their pasturelands£º Bezer, Jahaz¨ç, / ¨ç{Hebrew Jahzah, a variant spelling of Jahaz}
06Jos 21:37 Kedemoth, and Mephaath - four towns.
06Jos 21:38 From the tribe of Gad they received the following towns with their pasturelands£º Ramoth in Gilead (a city of refuge for those who accidentally killed someone), Mahanaim,
06Jos 21:39 Heshbon, and Jazer - four towns.
06Jos 21:40 So in all, twelve towns were allotted to the clan of Merari.
06Jos 21:41 The total number of towns and pasturelands within Israelite territory given to the Levites came to forty-eight.
06Jos 21:42 Every one of these towns had pasturelands surrounding it.
06Jos 21:43 So the LORD gave to Israel all the land he had sworn to give their ancestors, and they took possession of it and settled there.
06Jos 21:44 And the LORD gave them rest on every side, just as he had solemnly promised their ancestors. None of their enemies could stand against them, for the LORD helped them conquer all their enemies.
06Jos 21:45 Not a single one of all the good promises the LORD had given to the family of Israel was left unfulfilled; everything he had spoken came true.
06Jos 22:1 Then Joshua called together the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 22:2 He told them, "You have done as Moses, the servant of the LORD, commanded you, and you have obeyed every order I have given you.
06Jos 22:3 During all this time you have not deserted the other tribes. You have been careful to obey the commands of the LORD your God right up to the present day.
06Jos 22:4 And now the LORD your God has given the other tribes rest, as he promised them. So go back home to the land that Moses, the servant of the LORD, gave you as your possession on the east side of the Jordan River.
06Jos 22:5 But be very careful to obey all the commands and the instructions that Moses gave to you. Love the LORD your God, walk in all his ways, obey his commands, hold firmly to him, and serve him with all your heart and all your soul."
06Jos 22:6 So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went home.
06Jos 22:7 Moses had given the land of Bashan, east of the Jordan River, to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The other half of the tribe was given land west of the Jordan.) As Joshua sent them away and blessed them,
06Jos 22:8 he said to them, "Go back to your homes with the great wealth you have taken from your enemies - the vast herds of livestock, the silver, gold, bronze, and iron, and the large supply of clothing. Share the plunder with your relatives."
06Jos 22:9 So the men of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh left the rest of Israel at Shiloh in the land of Canaan. They started the journey back to their own land of Gilead, the territory that belonged to them according to the LORD's command through Moses.
06Jos 22:10 But while they were still in Canaan, and when they came to a place called Geliloth¨ç near the Jordan River, the men of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh stopped to build a large and imposing altar. / ¨ç{Or to the circle of stones; similarly in 22.11}
06Jos 22:11 The rest of Israel heard that the people of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh had built an altar at Geliloth at the edge of the land of Canaan, on the west side of the Jordan River.
06Jos 22:12 So the whole community of Israel gathered at Shiloh and prepared to go to war against them.
06Jos 22:13 First, however, they sent a delegation led by Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, to talk with the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 22:14 In this delegation were ten leaders of Israel, one from each of the ten tribes, and each the head of his family within the clans of Israel.
06Jos 22:15 When they arrived in the land of Gilead, they said to the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh,
06Jos 22:16 "The whole community of the LORD demands to know why you are betraying the God of Israel. How could you turn away from the LORD and build an altar for yourselves in rebellion against him?
06Jos 22:17 Was our sin at Peor not enough? To this day we are not fully cleansed of it, even after the plague that struck the entire community of the LORD.
06Jos 22:18 And yet today you are turning away from following the LORD. If you rebel against the LORD today, he will be angry with all of us tomorrow.
06Jos 22:19 "If you need the altar because the land you possess is defiled, then join us in the LORD's land, where the Tabernacle of the LORD is situated, and share our land with us. But do not rebel against the LORD or against us by building an altar other than the one true altar of the LORD our God.
06Jos 22:20 Didn't divine anger fall on the entire community of Israel when Achan, a member of the clan of Zerah, sinned by stealing the things set apart for the LORD¨ç? He was not the only one who died because of his sin." / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering}
06Jos 22:21 Then the people of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the heads of the clans of Israel.
06Jos 22:22 "The LORD, the Mighty One, is God! The LORD, the Mighty One, is God! He knows the truth, and may Israel know it, too! We have not built the altar in treacherous rebellion against the LORD. If we have done so, do not spare our lives this day.
06Jos 22:23 If we have built an altar for ourselves to turn away from the LORD or to offer burnt offerings or grain offerings or peace offerings, may the LORD himself punish us.
06Jos 22:24 "The truth is, we have built this altar because we fear that in the future your descendants will say to ours, 'What right do you have to worship the LORD, the God of Israel?
06Jos 22:25 The LORD has placed the Jordan River as a barrier between our people and you people of Reuben and Gad. You have no claim to the LORD.' So your descendants may prevent our descendants from worshiping the LORD.
06Jos 22:26 "So we decided to build the altar, not for burnt offerings or sacrifices,
06Jos 22:27 but as a memorial. It will remind our descendants and your descendants that we, too, have the right to worship the LORD at his sanctuary with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings. Then your descendants will not be able to say to ours, 'You have no claim to the LORD.'
06Jos 22:28 "If they say this, our descendants can reply, 'Look at this copy of the LORD's altar that our ancestors made. It is not for burnt offerings or sacrifices; it is a reminder of the relationship both of us have with the LORD.'
06Jos 22:29 Far be it from us to rebel against the LORD or turn away from him by building our own altar for burnt offerings, grain offerings, or sacrifices. Only the altar of the LORD our God that stands in front of the Tabernacle may be used for that purpose."
06Jos 22:30 When Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the community - the heads of the clans of Israel - heard this from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, they were satisfied.
06Jos 22:31 Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, replied to them, "Today we know the LORD is among us because you have not committed this treachery against the LORD as we thought. Instead, you have rescued Israel from being destroyed by the hand of the LORD."
06Jos 22:32 Then Phinehas son of Eleazar, the priest, and the other leaders left the tribes of Reuben and Gad in Gilead and returned to the land of Canaan to tell the Israelites what had happened.
06Jos 22:33 And all the Israelites were satisfied and praised God and spoke no more of war against Reuben and Gad.
06Jos 22:34 The people of Reuben and Gad named the altar "Witness,"¨ç for they said, "It is a witness between us and them that the LORD is our God, too." / ¨ç{Some manuscripts lack this word}
06Jos 23:1 The years passed, and the LORD had given the people of Israel rest from all their enemies. Joshua, who was now very old,
06Jos 23:2 called together all the elders, leaders, judges, and officers of Israel. He said to them, "I am now a very old man.
06Jos 23:3 You have seen everything the LORD your God has done for you during my lifetime. The LORD your God has fought for you against your enemies.
06Jos 23:4 I have allotted to you as your homeland all the land of the nations yet unconquered, as well as the land of those we have already conquered - from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea¨ç in the west. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Great Sea}
06Jos 23:5 This land will be yours, for the LORD your God will himself drive out all the people living there now. You will take possession of their land, just as the LORD your God promised you.
06Jos 23:6 "So be very careful to follow everything Moses wrote in the Book of Instruction. Do not deviate from it, turning either to the right or to the left.
06Jos 23:7 Make sure you do not associate with the other people still remaining in the land. Do not even mention the names of their gods, much less swear by them or serve them or worship them.
06Jos 23:8 Rather, cling tightly to the LORD your God as you have done until now.
06Jos 23:9 "For the LORD has driven out great and powerful nations for you, and no one has yet been able to defeat you.
06Jos 23:10 Each one of you will put to flight a thousand of the enemy, for the LORD your God fights for you, just as he has promised.
06Jos 23:11 So be very careful to love the LORD your God.
06Jos 23:12 "But if you turn away from him and cling to the customs of the survivors of these nations remaining among you, and if you intermarry with them,
06Jos 23:13 then know for certain that the LORD your God will no longer drive them out of your land. Instead, they will be a snare and a trap to you, a whip for your backs and thorny brambles in your eyes, and you will vanish from this good land the LORD your God has given you.
06Jos 23:14 "Soon I will die, going the way of everything on earth. Deep in your hearts you know that every promise of the LORD your God has come true. Not a single one has failed!
06Jos 23:15 But as surely as the LORD your God has given you the good things he promised, he will also bring disaster on you if you disobey him. He will completely destroy you from this good land he has given you.
06Jos 23:16 If you break the covenant of the LORD your God by worshiping and serving other gods, his anger will burn against you, and you will quickly vanish from the good land he has given you."
06Jos 24:1 Then Joshua summoned all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, including their elders, leaders, judges, and officers. So they came and presented themselves to God.
06Jos 24:2 Joshua said to the people, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º Long ago your ancestors, including Terah, the father of Abraham and Nahor, lived beyond the Euphrates River¨ç, and they worshiped other gods. / ¨ç{Hebrew the river; also in 24.3, 14, 15}
06Jos 24:3 But I took your ancestor Abraham from the land beyond the Euphrates and led him into the land of Canaan. I gave him many descendants through his son Isaac.
06Jos 24:4 To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau. To Esau I gave the mountains of Seir, while Jacob and his children went down into Egypt.
06Jos 24:5 "Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I brought terrible plagues on Egypt; and afterward I brought you out as a free people.
06Jos 24:6 But when your ancestors arrived at the Red Sea¨ç, the Egyptians chased after you with chariots and charioteers. / ¨ç{Hebrew sea of reeds}
06Jos 24:7 When your ancestors cried out to the LORD, I put darkness between you and the Egyptians. I brought the sea crashing down on the Egyptians, drowning them. With your very own eyes you saw what I did. Then you lived in the wilderness for many years.
06Jos 24:8 "Finally, I brought you into the land of the Amorites on the east side of the Jordan. They fought against you, but I destroyed them before you. I gave you victory over them, and you took possession of their land.
06Jos 24:9 Then Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab, started a war against Israel. He summoned Balaam son of Beor to curse you,
06Jos 24:10 but I would not listen to him. Instead, I made Balaam bless you, and so I rescued you from Balak.
06Jos 24:11 "When you crossed the Jordan River and came to Jericho, the men of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. But I gave you victory over them.
06Jos 24:12 And I sent terror¨ç ahead of you to drive out the two kings of the Amorites. It was not your swords or bows that brought you victory. / ¨ç{Often rendered the hornet. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
06Jos 24:13 I gave you land you had not worked on, and I gave you towns you did not build - the towns where you are now living. I gave you vineyards and olive groves for food, though you did not plant them.
06Jos 24:14 "So fear the LORD and serve him wholeheartedly. Put away forever the idols your ancestors worshiped when they lived beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt. Serve the LORD alone.
06Jos 24:15 But if you refuse to serve the LORD, then choose today whom you will serve. Would you prefer the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates? Or will it be the gods of the Amorites in whose land you now live? But as for me and my family, we will serve the LORD."
06Jos 24:16 The people replied, "We would never abandon the LORD and serve other gods.
06Jos 24:17 For the LORD our God is the one who rescued us and our ancestors from slavery in the land of Egypt. He performed mighty miracles before our very eyes. As we traveled through the wilderness among our enemies, he preserved us.
06Jos 24:18 It was the LORD who drove out the Amorites and the other nations living here in the land. So we, too, will serve the LORD, for he alone is our God."
06Jos 24:19 Then Joshua warned the people, "You are not able to serve the LORD, for he is a holy and jealous God. He will not forgive your rebellion and your sins.
06Jos 24:20 If you abandon the LORD and serve other gods, he will turn against you and destroy you, even though he has been so good to you."
06Jos 24:21 But the people answered Joshua, "No, we will serve the LORD!"
06Jos 24:22 "You are a witness to your own decision," Joshua said. "You have chosen to serve the LORD." "Yes," they replied, "we are witnesses to what we have said."
06Jos 24:23 "All right then," Joshua said, "destroy the idols among you, and turn your hearts to the LORD, the God of Israel."
06Jos 24:24 The people said to Joshua, "We will serve the LORD our God. We will obey him alone."
06Jos 24:25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day at Shechem, committing them to follow the decrees and regulations of the LORD.
06Jos 24:26 Joshua recorded these things in the Book of God's Instructions. As a reminder of their agreement, he took a huge stone and rolled it beneath the terebinth tree beside the Tabernacle of the LORD.
06Jos 24:27 Joshua said to all the people, "This stone has heard everything the LORD said to us. It will be a witness to testify against you if you go back on your word to God."
06Jos 24:28 Then Joshua sent all the people away to their own homelands.
06Jos 24:29 After this, Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110.
06Jos 24:30 They buried him in the land he had been allocated, at Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
06Jos 24:31 The people of Israel served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and of the elders who outlived him - those who had personally experienced all that the LORD had done for Israel.
06Jos 24:32 The bones of Joseph, which the Israelites had brought along with them when they left Egypt, were buried at Shechem, in the parcel of ground Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor for 100 pieces of silver¨ç. This land was located in the territory allotted to the descendants of Joseph. / ¨ç{Hebrew 100 kesitahs; the value or weight of the kesitah is no longer known}
06Jos 24:33 Eleazar son of Aaron also died. He was buried in the hill country of Ephraim, in the town of Gibeah, which had been given to his son Phinehas.

07Jdg 1:1 After the death of Joshua, the Israelites asked the LORD, "Which tribe should go first to attack the Canaanites?"
07Jdg 1:2 The LORD answered, "Judah, for I have given them victory over the land."
07Jdg 1:3 The men of Judah said to their relatives from the tribe of Simeon, "Join with us to fight against the Canaanites living in the territory allotted to us. Then we will help you conquer your territory." So the men of Simeon went with Judah.
07Jdg 1:4 When the men of Judah attacked, the LORD gave them victory over the Canaanites and Perizzites, and they killed 10,000 enemy warriors at the town of Bezek.
07Jdg 1:5 While at Bezek they encountered King Adoni-bezek and fought against him, and the Canaanites and Perizzites were defeated.
07Jdg 1:6 Adoni-bezek escaped, but the Israelites soon captured him and cut off his thumbs and big toes.
07Jdg 1:7 Adoni-bezek said, "I once had seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off, eating scraps from under my table. Now God has paid me back for what I did to them." They took him to Jerusalem, and he died there.
07Jdg 1:8 The men of Judah attacked Jerusalem and captured it, killing all its people and setting the city on fire.
07Jdg 1:9 Then they went down to fight the Canaanites living in the hill country, the Negev, and the western foothills¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Shephelah}
07Jdg 1:10 Judah marched against the Canaanites in Hebron (formerly called Kiriath-arba), defeating the forces of Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
07Jdg 1:11 From there they went to fight against the people living in the town of Debir (formerly called Kiriath-sepher).
07Jdg 1:12 Caleb said, "I will give my daughter Acsah in marriage to the one who attacks and captures Kiriath-sepher."
07Jdg 1:13 Othniel, the son of Caleb's younger brother, Kenaz, was the one who conquered it, so Acsah became Othniel's wife.
07Jdg 1:14 When Acsah married Othniel, she urged him¨ç to ask her father for a field. As she got down off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What's the matter?" / ¨ç{Greek version and Latin Vulgate read he urged her}
07Jdg 1:15 She said, "Let me have another gift. You have already given me land in the Negev; now please give me springs of water, too." So Caleb gave her the upper and lower springs.
07Jdg 1:16 When the tribe of Judah left Jericho - the city of palms - the Kenites, who were descendants of Moses' father-in-law, traveled with them into the wilderness of Judah. They settled among the people there, near the town of Arad in the Negev.
07Jdg 1:17 Then Judah joined with Simeon to fight against the Canaanites living in Zephath, and they completely destroyed¨ç the town. So the town was named Hormah¨è. / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering} ¨è{Hormah means "destruction."}
07Jdg 1:18 In addition, Judah captured the towns of Gaza, Ashkelon, and Ekron, along with their surrounding territories.
07Jdg 1:19 The LORD was with the people of Judah, and they took possession of the hill country. But they failed to drive out the people living in the plains, who had iron chariots.
07Jdg 1:20 The town of Hebron was given to Caleb as Moses had promised. And Caleb drove out the people living there, who were descendants of the three sons of Anak.
07Jdg 1:21 The tribe of Benjamin, however, failed to drive out the Jebusites, who were living in Jerusalem. So to this day the Jebusites live in Jerusalem among the people of Benjamin.
07Jdg 1:22 The descendants of Joseph attacked the town of Bethel, and the LORD was with them.
07Jdg 1:23 They sent men to scout out Bethel (formerly known as Luz).
07Jdg 1:24 They confronted a man coming out of the town and said to him, "Show us a way into the town, and we will have mercy on you."
07Jdg 1:25 So he showed them a way in, and they killed everyone in the town except that man and his family.
07Jdg 1:26 Later the man moved to the land of the Hittites, where he built a town. He named it Luz, which is its name to this day.
07Jdg 1:27 The tribe of Manasseh failed to drive out the people living in Beth-shan¨ç, Taanach, Dor, Ibleam, Megiddo, and all their surrounding settlements, because the Canaanites were determined to stay in that region. / ¨ç{Hebrew Beth-shean, a variant spelling of Beth-shan}
07Jdg 1:28 When the Israelites grew stronger, they forced the Canaanites to work as slaves, but they never did drive them completely out of the land.
07Jdg 1:29 The tribe of Ephraim failed to drive out the Canaanites living in Gezer, so the Canaanites continued to live there among them.
07Jdg 1:30 The tribe of Zebulun failed to drive out the residents of Kitron and Nahalol, so the Canaanites continued to live among them. But the Canaanites were forced to work as slaves for the people of Zebulun.
07Jdg 1:31 The tribe of Asher failed to drive out the residents of Acco, Sidon, Ahlab, Aczib, Helbah, Aphik, and Rehob.
07Jdg 1:32 Instead, the people of Asher moved in among the Canaanites, who controlled the land, for they failed to drive them out.
07Jdg 1:33 Likewise, the tribe of Naphtali failed to drive out the residents of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath. Instead, they moved in among the Canaanites, who controlled the land. Nevertheless, the people of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath were forced to work as slaves for the people of Naphtali.
07Jdg 1:34 As for the tribe of Dan, the Amorites forced them back into the hill country and would not let them come down into the plains.
07Jdg 1:35 The Amorites were determined to stay in Mount Heres, Aijalon, and Shaalbim, but when the descendants of Joseph became stronger, they forced the Amorites to work as slaves.
07Jdg 1:36 The boundary of the Amorites ran from Scorpion Pass¨ç to Sela and continued upward from there. / ¨ç{Hebrew Akrabbim}
07Jdg 2:1 The angel of the LORD went up from Gilgal to Bokim and said to the Israelites, "I brought you out of Egypt into this land that I swore to give your ancestors, and I said I would never break my covenant with you.
07Jdg 2:2 For your part, you were not to make any covenants with the people living in this land; instead, you were to destroy their altars. But you disobeyed my command. Why did you do this?
07Jdg 2:3 So now I declare that I will no longer drive out the people living in your land. They will be thorns in your sides¨ç, and their gods will be a constant temptation to you." / ¨ç{Hebrew They will be in your sides; compare Num 33.55}
07Jdg 2:4 When the angel of the LORD finished speaking to all the Israelites, the people wept loudly.
07Jdg 2:5 So they called the place Bokim (which means "weeping"), and they offered sacrifices there to the LORD.
07Jdg 2:6 After Joshua sent the people away, each of the tribes left to take possession of the land allotted to them.
07Jdg 2:7 And the Israelites served the LORD throughout the lifetime of Joshua and the leaders who outlived him - those who had seen all the great things the LORD had done for Israel.
07Jdg 2:8 Joshua son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of 110.
07Jdg 2:9 They buried him in the land he had been allocated, at Timnath-serah¨ç in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. / ¨ç{As in parallel text at Josh 24.30; Hebrew reads Timnath-heres, a variant spelling of Timnath-serah}
07Jdg 2:10 After that generation died, another generation grew up who did not acknowledge the LORD or remember the mighty things he had done for Israel.
07Jdg 2:11 The Israelites did evil in the LORD's sight and served the images of Baal.
07Jdg 2:12 They abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of Egypt. They went after other gods, worshiping the gods of the people around them. And they angered the LORD.
07Jdg 2:13 They abandoned the LORD to serve Baal and the images of Ashtoreth.
07Jdg 2:14 This made the LORD burn with anger against Israel, so he handed them over to raiders who stole their possessions. He turned them over to their enemies all around, and they were no longer able to resist them.
07Jdg 2:15 Every time Israel went out to battle, the LORD fought against them, causing them to be defeated, just as he had warned. And the people were in great distress.
07Jdg 2:16 Then the LORD raised up judges to rescue the Israelites from their attackers.
07Jdg 2:17 Yet Israel did not listen to the judges but prostituted themselves by worshiping other gods. How quickly they turned away from the path of their ancestors, who had walked in obedience to the LORD's commands.
07Jdg 2:18 Whenever the LORD raised up a judge over Israel, he was with that judge and rescued the people from their enemies throughout the judge's lifetime. For the LORD took pity on his people, who were burdened by oppression and suffering.
07Jdg 2:19 But when the judge died, the people returned to their corrupt ways, behaving worse than those who had lived before them. They went after other gods, serving and worshiping them. And they refused to give up their evil practices and stubborn ways.
07Jdg 2:20 So the LORD burned with anger against Israel. He said, "Because these people have violated my covenant, which I made with their ancestors, and have ignored my commands,
07Jdg 2:21 I will no longer drive out the nations that Joshua left unconquered when he died.
07Jdg 2:22 I did this to test Israel - to see whether or not they would follow the ways of the LORD as their ancestors did."
07Jdg 2:23 That is why the LORD left those nations in place. He did not quickly drive them out or allow Joshua to conquer them all.
07Jdg 3:1 These are the nations that the LORD left in the land to test those Israelites who had not experienced the wars of Canaan.
07Jdg 3:2 He did this to teach warfare to generations of Israelites who had no experience in battle.
07Jdg 3:3 These are the nations£º the Philistines (those living under the five Philistine rulers), all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites living in the mountains of Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to Lebo-hamath.
07Jdg 3:4 These people were left to test the Israelites - to see whether they would obey the commands the LORD had given to their ancestors through Moses.
07Jdg 3:5 So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites,
07Jdg 3:6 and they intermarried with them. Israelite sons married their daughters, and Israelite daughters were given in marriage to their sons. And the Israelites served their gods.
07Jdg 3:7 The Israelites did evil in the LORD's sight. They forgot about the LORD their God, and they served the images of Baal and the Asherah poles.
07Jdg 3:8 Then the LORD burned with anger against Israel, and he turned them over to King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim¨ç. And the Israelites served Cushan-rishathaim for eight years. / ¨ç{Aram-naharaim means "Aram of the two rivers," thought to have been located between the Euphrates and Balih Rivers in northwestern Mesopotamia}
07Jdg 3:9 But when the people of Israel cried out to the LORD for help, the LORD raised up a rescuer to save them. His name was Othniel, the son of Caleb's younger brother, Kenaz.
07Jdg 3:10 The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he became Israel's judge. He went to war against King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram, and the LORD gave Othniel victory over him.
07Jdg 3:11 So there was peace in the land for forty years. Then Othniel son of Kenaz died.
07Jdg 3:12 Once again the Israelites did evil in the LORD's sight, and the LORD gave King Eglon of Moab control over Israel because of their evil.
07Jdg 3:13 Eglon enlisted the Ammonites and Amalekites as allies, and then he went out and defeated Israel, taking possession of Jericho, the city of palms.
07Jdg 3:14 And the Israelites served Eglon of Moab for eighteen years.
07Jdg 3:15 But when the people of Israel cried out to the LORD for help, the LORD again raised up a rescuer to save them. His name was Ehud son of Gera, a left-handed man of the tribe of Benjamin. The Israelites sent Ehud to deliver their tribute money to King Eglon of Moab.
07Jdg 3:16 So Ehud made a double-edged dagger that was about a foot¨ç long, and he strapped it to his right thigh, keeping it hidden under his clothing. / ¨ç{Hebrew gomed, the length of which is uncertain}
07Jdg 3:17 He brought the tribute money to Eglon, who was very fat.
07Jdg 3:18 After delivering the payment, Ehud started home with those who had helped carry the tribute.
07Jdg 3:19 But when Ehud reached the stone idols near Gilgal, he turned back. He came to Eglon and said, "I have a secret message for you." So the king commanded his servants, "Be quiet!" and he sent them all out of the room.
07Jdg 3:20 Ehud walked over to Eglon, who was sitting alone in a cool upstairs room. And Ehud said, "I have a message from God for you!" As King Eglon rose from his seat,
07Jdg 3:21 Ehud reached with his left hand, pulled out the dagger strapped to his right thigh, and plunged it into the king's belly.
07Jdg 3:22 The dagger went so deep that the handle disappeared beneath the king's fat. So Ehud did not pull out the dagger, and the king's bowels emptied¨ç. / ¨ç{Or and it came out behind}
07Jdg 3:23 Then Ehud closed and locked the doors of the room and escaped down the latrine¨ç. / ¨ç{Or and went out through the porch; the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
07Jdg 3:24 After Ehud was gone, the king's servants returned and found the doors to the upstairs room locked. They thought he might be using the latrine in the room,
07Jdg 3:25 so they waited. But when the king didn't come out after a long delay, they became concerned and got a key. And when they opened the doors, they found their master dead on the floor.
07Jdg 3:26 While the servants were waiting, Ehud escaped, passing the stone idols on his way to Seirah.
07Jdg 3:27 When he arrived in the hill country of Ephraim, Ehud sounded a call to arms. Then he led a band of Israelites down from the hills.
07Jdg 3:28 "Follow me," he said, "for the LORD has given you victory over Moab your enemy." So they followed him. And the Israelites took control of the shallow crossings of the Jordan River across from Moab, preventing anyone from crossing.
07Jdg 3:29 They attacked the Moabites and killed about 10,000 of their strongest and most able-bodied warriors. Not one of them escaped.
07Jdg 3:30 So Moab was conquered by Israel that day, and there was peace in the land for eighty years.
07Jdg 3:31 After Ehud, Shamgar son of Anath rescued Israel. He once killed 600 Philistines with an ox goad.
07Jdg 4:1 After Ehud's death, the Israelites again did evil in the LORD's sight.
07Jdg 4:2 So the LORD turned them over to King Jabin of Hazor, a Canaanite king. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-haggoyim.
07Jdg 4:3 Sisera, who had 900 iron chariots, ruthlessly oppressed the Israelites for twenty years. Then the people of Israel cried out to the LORD for help.
07Jdg 4:4 Deborah, the wife of Lappidoth, was a prophet who was judging Israel at that time.
07Jdg 4:5 She would sit under the Palm of Deborah, between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the Israelites would go to her for judgment.
07Jdg 4:6 One day she sent for Barak son of Abinoam, who lived in Kedesh in the land of Naphtali. She said to him, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, commands you£º Call out 10,000 warriors from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun at Mount Tabor.
07Jdg 4:7 And I will call out Sisera, commander of Jabin's army, along with his chariots and warriors, to the Kishon River. There I will give you victory over him."
07Jdg 4:8 Barak told her, "I will go, but only if you go with me."
07Jdg 4:9 "Very well," she replied, "I will go with you. But you will receive no honor in this venture, for the LORD's victory over Sisera will be at the hands of a woman." So Deborah went with Barak to Kedesh.
07Jdg 4:10 At Kedesh, Barak called together the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali, and 10,000 warriors went up with him. Deborah also went with him.
07Jdg 4:11 Now Heber the Kenite, a descendant of Moses' brother-in-law¨ç Hobab, had moved away from the other members of his tribe and pitched his tent by the oak of Zaanannim near Kedesh. / ¨ç{Or father-in-law}
07Jdg 4:12 When Sisera was told that Barak son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor,
07Jdg 4:13 he called for all 900 of his iron chariots and all of his warriors, and they marched from Harosheth-haggoyim to the Kishon River.
07Jdg 4:14 Then Deborah said to Barak, "Get ready! This is the day the LORD will give you victory over Sisera, for the LORD is marching ahead of you." So Barak led his 10,000 warriors down the slopes of Mount Tabor into battle.
07Jdg 4:15 When Barak attacked, the LORD threw Sisera and all his chariots and warriors into a panic. Sisera leaped down from his chariot and escaped on foot.
07Jdg 4:16 Then Barak chased the chariots and the enemy army all the way to Harosheth-haggoyim, killing all of Sisera's warriors. Not a single one was left alive.
07Jdg 4:17 Meanwhile, Sisera ran to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because Heber's family was on friendly terms with King Jabin of Hazor.
07Jdg 4:18 Jael went out to meet Sisera and said to him, "Come into my tent, sir. Come in. Don't be afraid." So he went into her tent, and she covered him with a blanket.
07Jdg 4:19 "Please give me some water," he said. "I'm thirsty." So she gave him some milk from a leather bag and covered him again.
07Jdg 4:20 "Stand at the door of the tent," he told her. "If anybody comes and asks you if there is anyone here, say no."
07Jdg 4:21 But when Sisera fell asleep from exhaustion, Jael quietly crept up to him with a hammer and tent peg in her hand. Then she drove the tent peg through his temple and into the ground, and so he died.
07Jdg 4:22 When Barak came looking for Sisera, Jael went out to meet him. She said, "Come, and I will show you the man you are looking for." So he followed her into the tent and found Sisera lying there dead, with the tent peg through his temple.
07Jdg 4:23 So on that day Israel saw God defeat Jabin, the Canaanite king.
07Jdg 4:24 And from that time on Israel became stronger and stronger against King Jabin until they finally destroyed him.
07Jdg 5:1 On that day Deborah and Barak son of Abinoam sang this song.
07Jdg 5:2 "Israel's leaders took charge, and the people gladly followed. Praise the LORD!
07Jdg 5:3 "Listen, you kings! Pay attention, you mighty rulers! For I will sing to the LORD.I will make music to the LORD, the God of Israel.
07Jdg 5:4 "LORD, when you set out from Seir and marched across the fields of Edom, the earth trembled, and the cloudy skies poured down rain.
07Jdg 5:5 The mountains quaked in the presence of the LORD, the God of Mount Sinai - in the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.
07Jdg 5:6 "In the days of Shamgar son of Anath, and in the days of Jael, people avoided the main roads, and travelers stayed on winding pathways.
07Jdg 5:7 There were few people left in the villages of Israel¨ç - until Deborah arose as a mother for Israel. / ¨ç{The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
07Jdg 5:8 When Israel chose new gods, war erupted at the city gates. Yet not a shield or spear could be seen among forty thousand warriors in Israel!
07Jdg 5:9 My heart is with the commanders of Israel, with those who volunteered for war. Praise the LORD!
07Jdg 5:10 "Consider this, you who ride on fine donkeys, you who sit on fancy saddle blankets, and you who walk along the road.
07Jdg 5:11 Listen to the village musicians¨ç gathered at the watering holes. They recount the righteous victories of the LORD and the victories of his villagers in Israel. Then the people of the LORD marched down to the city gates. / ¨ç{The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
07Jdg 5:12 "Wake up, Deborah, wake up! Wake up, wake up, and sing a song! Arise, Barak! Lead your captives away, son of Abinoam!
07Jdg 5:13 "Down from Tabor marched the few against the nobles.The people of the LORD marched down against mighty warriors. 
07Jdg 5:14 They came down from Ephraim - a land that once belonged to the Amalekites; they followed you, Benjamin, with your troops. From Makir the commanders marched down; from Zebulun came those who carry a commander's staff.
07Jdg 5:15 The princes of Issachar were with Deborah and Barak.They followed Barak, rushing into the valley. But in the tribe of Reuben there was great indecision.
07Jdg 5:16 Why did you sit at home among the sheepfolds - to hear the shepherds whistle for their flocks? Yes, in the tribe of Reuben there was great indecision.
07Jdg 5:17 Gilead remained east of the Jordan.And why did Dan stay home? Asher sat unmoved at the seashore, remaining in his harbors.
07Jdg 5:18 But Zebulun risked his life, as did Naphtali, on the heights of the battlefield.
07Jdg 5:19 "The kings of Canaan came and fought, at Taanach near Megiddo's springs, but they carried off no silver treasures.
07Jdg 5:20 The stars fought from heaven.The stars in their orbits fought against Sisera.
07Jdg 5:21 The Kishon River swept them away - that ancient torrent, the Kishon. March on with courage, my soul!
07Jdg 5:22 Then the horses' hooves hammered the ground, the galloping, galloping of Sisera's mighty steeds.
07Jdg 5:23 'Let the people of Meroz be cursed,' said the angel of the LORD.'Let them be utterly cursed, because they did not come to help the LORD - to help the LORD against the mighty warriors.'
07Jdg 5:24 "Most blessed among women is Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite.May she be blessed above all women who live in tents.
07Jdg 5:25 Sisera asked for water, and she gave him milk. In a bowl fit for nobles, she brought him yogurt.
07Jdg 5:26 Then with her left hand she reached for a tent peg, and with her right hand for the workman's hammer. She struck Sisera with the hammer, crushing his head.With a shattering blow, she pierced his temples.
07Jdg 5:27 He sank, he fell, he lay still at her feet. And where he sank, there he died.
07Jdg 5:28 "From the window Sisera's mother looked out.Through the window she watched for his return, saying, 'Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why don't we hear the sound of chariot wheels?'
07Jdg 5:29 "Her wise women answer, and she repeats these words to herself.
07Jdg 5:30 'They must be dividing the captured plunder - with a woman or two for every man. There will be colorful robes for Sisera, and colorful, embroidered robes for me. Yes, the plunder will include colorful robes embroidered on both sides.'
07Jdg 5:31 "LORD, may all your enemies die like Sisera! But may those who love you rise like the sun in all its power!" Then there was peace in the land for forty years.
07Jdg 6:1 The Israelites did evil in the LORD's sight. So the LORD handed them over to the Midianites for seven years.
07Jdg 6:2 The Midianites were so cruel that the Israelites made hiding places for themselves in the mountains, caves, and strongholds.
07Jdg 6:3 Whenever the Israelites planted their crops, marauders from Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east would attack Israel,
07Jdg 6:4 camping in the land and destroying crops as far away as Gaza. They left the Israelites with nothing to eat, taking all the sheep, goats, cattle, and donkeys.
07Jdg 6:5 These enemy hordes, coming with their livestock and tents, were as thick as locusts; they arrived on droves of camels too numerous to count. And they stayed until the land was stripped bare.
07Jdg 6:6 So Israel was reduced to starvation by the Midianites. Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD for help.
07Jdg 6:7 When they cried out to the LORD because of Midian,
07Jdg 6:8 the LORD sent a prophet to the Israelites. He said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º I brought you up out of slavery in Egypt.
07Jdg 6:9 I rescued you from the Egyptians and from all who oppressed you. I drove out your enemies and gave you their land.
07Jdg 6:10 I told you, 'I am the LORD your God. You must not worship the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you now live.' But you have not listened to me."
07Jdg 6:11 Then the angel of the LORD came and sat beneath the great tree at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash of the clan of Abiezer. Gideon son of Joash was threshing wheat at the bottom of a winepress to hide the grain from the Midianites.
07Jdg 6:12 The angel of the LORD appeared to him and said, "Mighty hero, the LORD is with you!"
07Jdg 6:13 "Sir," Gideon replied, "if the LORD is with us, why has all this happened to us? And where are all the miracles our ancestors told us about? Didn't they say, 'The LORD brought us up out of Egypt'? But now the LORD has abandoned us and handed us over to the Midianites."
07Jdg 6:14 Then the LORD turned to him and said, "Go with the strength you have, and rescue Israel from the Midianites. I am sending you!"
07Jdg 6:15 "But Lord," Gideon replied, "how can I rescue Israel? My clan is the weakest in the whole tribe of Manasseh, and I am the least in my entire family!"
07Jdg 6:16 The LORD said to him, "I will be with you. And you will destroy the Midianites as if you were fighting against one man."
07Jdg 6:17 Gideon replied, "If you are truly going to help me, show me a sign to prove that it is really the LORD speaking to me.
07Jdg 6:18 Don't go away until I come back and bring my offering to you." He answered, "I will stay here until you return."
07Jdg 6:19 Gideon hurried home. He cooked a young goat, and with a basket¨ç of flour he baked some bread without yeast. Then, carrying the meat in a basket and the broth in a pot, he brought them out and presented them to the angel, who was under the great tree. / ¨ç{Hebrew an ephah [20 quarts or 22 liters]}
07Jdg 6:20 The angel of God said to him, "Place the meat and the unleavened bread on this rock, and pour the broth over it." And Gideon did as he was told.
07Jdg 6:21 Then the angel of the LORD touched the meat and bread with the tip of the staff in his hand, and fire flamed up from the rock and consumed all he had brought. And the angel of the LORD disappeared.
07Jdg 6:22 When Gideon realized that it was the angel of the LORD, he cried out, "Oh, Sovereign LORD, I'm doomed! I have seen the angel of the LORD face to face!"
07Jdg 6:23 "It is all right," the LORD replied. "Do not be afraid. You will not die."
07Jdg 6:24 And Gideon built an altar to the LORD there and named it Yahweh-Shalom (which means "the LORD is peace"). The altar remains in Ophrah in the land of the clan of Abiezer to this day.
07Jdg 6:25 That night the LORD said to Gideon, "Take the second bull from your father's herd, the one that is seven years old. Pull down your father's altar to Baal, and cut down the Asherah pole standing beside it.
07Jdg 6:26 Then build an altar to the LORD your God here on this hilltop sanctuary, laying the stones carefully. Sacrifice the bull as a burnt offering on the altar, using as fuel the wood of the Asherah pole you cut down."
07Jdg 6:27 So Gideon took ten of his servants and did as the LORD had commanded. But he did it at night because he was afraid of the other members of his father's household and the people of the town.
07Jdg 6:28 Early the next morning, as the people of the town began to stir, someone discovered that the altar of Baal had been broken down and that the Asherah pole beside it had been cut down. In their place a new altar had been built, and on it were the remains of the bull that had been sacrificed.
07Jdg 6:29 The people said to each other, "Who did this?" And after asking around and making a careful search, they learned that it was Gideon, the son of Joash.
07Jdg 6:30 "Bring out your son," the men of the town demanded of Joash. "He must die for destroying the altar of Baal and for cutting down the Asherah pole."
07Jdg 6:31 But Joash shouted to the mob that confronted him, "Why are you defending Baal? Will you argue his case? Whoever pleads his case will be put to death by morning! If Baal truly is a god, let him defend himself and destroy the one who broke down his altar!"
07Jdg 6:32 From then on Gideon was called Jerub-baal, which means "Let Baal defend himself," because he broke down Baal's altar.
07Jdg 6:33 Soon afterward the armies of Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east formed an alliance against Israel and crossed the Jordan, camping in the valley of Jezreel.
07Jdg 6:34 Then the Spirit of the LORD took possession of Gideon. He blew a ram's horn as a call to arms, and the men of the clan of Abiezer came to him.
07Jdg 6:35 He also sent messengers throughout Manasseh, Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, summoning their warriors, and all of them responded.
07Jdg 6:36 Then Gideon said to God, "If you are truly going to use me to rescue Israel as you promised,
07Jdg 6:37 prove it to me in this way. I will put a wool fleece on the threshing floor tonight. If the fleece is wet with dew in the morning but the ground is dry, then I will know that you are going to help me rescue Israel as you promised."
07Jdg 6:38 And that is just what happened. When Gideon got up early the next morning, he squeezed the fleece and wrung out a whole bowlful of water.
07Jdg 6:39 Then Gideon said to God, "Please don't be angry with me, but let me make one more request. Let me use the fleece for one more test. This time let the fleece remain dry while the ground around it is wet with dew."
07Jdg 6:40 So that night God did as Gideon asked. The fleece was dry in the morning, but the ground was covered with dew.
07Jdg 7:1 So Jerub-baal (that is, Gideon) and his army got up early and went as far as the spring of Harod. The armies of Midian were camped north of them in the valley near the hill of Moreh.
07Jdg 7:2 The LORD said to Gideon, "You have too many warriors with you. If I let all of you fight the Midianites, the Israelites will boast to me that they saved themselves by their own strength.
07Jdg 7:3 Therefore, tell the people, 'Whoever is timid or afraid may leave this mountain¨ç and go home.'" So 22,000 of them went home, leaving only 10,000 who were willing to fight. / ¨ç{Hebrew may leave Mount Gilead. The identity of Mount Gilead is uncertain in this context. It is perhaps used here as another name for Mount Gilboa}
07Jdg 7:4 But the LORD told Gideon, "There are still too many! Bring them down to the spring, and I will test them to determine who will go with you and who will not."
07Jdg 7:5 When Gideon took his warriors down to the water, the LORD told him, "Divide the men into two groups. In one group put all those who cup water in their hands and lap it up with their tongues like dogs. In the other group put all those who kneel down and drink with their mouths in the stream."
07Jdg 7:6 Only 300 of the men drank from their hands. All the others got down on their knees and drank with their mouths in the stream.
07Jdg 7:7 The LORD told Gideon, "With these 300 men I will rescue you and give you victory over the Midianites. Send all the others home."
07Jdg 7:8 So Gideon collected the provisions and rams' horns of the other warriors and sent them home. But he kept the 300 men with him. The Midianite camp was in the valley just below Gideon.
07Jdg 7:9 That night the LORD said, "Get up! Go down into the Midianite camp, for I have given you victory over them!
07Jdg 7:10 But if you are afraid to attack, go down to the camp with your servant Purah.
07Jdg 7:11 Listen to what the Midianites are saying, and you will be greatly encouraged. Then you will be eager to attack." So Gideon took Purah and went down to the edge of the enemy camp.
07Jdg 7:12 The armies of Midian, Amalek, and the people of the east had settled in the valley like a swarm of locusts. Their camels were like grains of sand on the seashore - too many to count!
07Jdg 7:13 Gideon crept up just as a man was telling his companion about a dream. The man said, "I had this dream, and in my dream a loaf of barley bread came tumbling down into the Midianite camp. It hit a tent, turned it over, and knocked it flat!"
07Jdg 7:14 His companion answered, "Your dream can mean only one thing - God has given Gideon son of Joash, the Israelite, victory over Midian and all its allies!"
07Jdg 7:15 When Gideon heard the dream and its interpretation, he bowed in worship before the LORD¨ç. Then he returned to the Israelite camp and shouted, "Get up! For the LORD has given you victory over the Midianite hordes!" / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads he bowed}
07Jdg 7:16 He divided the 300 men into three groups and gave each man a ram's horn and a clay jar with a torch in it.
07Jdg 7:17 Then he said to them, "Keep your eyes on me. When I come to the edge of the camp, do just as I do.
07Jdg 7:18 As soon as I and those with me blow the rams' horns, blow your horns, too, all around the entire camp, and shout, 'For the LORD and for Gideon!'"
07Jdg 7:19 It was just after midnight¨ç, after the changing of the guard, when Gideon and the 100 men with him reached the edge of the Midianite camp. Suddenly, they blew the rams' horns and broke their clay jars. / ¨ç{Hebrew at the beginning of the second watch}
07Jdg 7:20 Then all three groups blew their horns and broke their jars. They held the blazing torches in their left hands and the horns in their right hands, and they all shouted, "A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!"
07Jdg 7:21 Each man stood at his position around the camp and watched as all the Midianites rushed around in a panic, shouting as they ran to escape.
07Jdg 7:22 When the 300 Israelites blew their rams' horns, the LORD caused the warriors in the camp to fight against each other with their swords. Those who were not killed fled to places as far away as Beth-shittah near Zererah and to the border of Abel-meholah near Tabbath.
07Jdg 7:23 Then Gideon sent for the warriors of Naphtali, Asher, and Manasseh, who joined in chasing the army of Midian.
07Jdg 7:24 Gideon also sent messengers throughout the hill country of Ephraim, saying, "Come down to attack the Midianites. Cut them off at the shallow crossings of the Jordan River at Beth-barah." So all the men of Ephraim did as they were told.
07Jdg 7:25 They captured Oreb and Zeeb, the two Midianite commanders, killing Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb at the winepress of Zeeb. And they continued to chase the Midianites. Afterward the Israelites brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon, who was by the Jordan River.
07Jdg 8:1 Then the people of Ephraim asked Gideon, "Why have you treated us this way? Why didn't you send for us when you first went out to fight the Midianites?" And they argued heatedly with Gideon.
07Jdg 8:2 But Gideon replied, "What have I accomplished compared to you? Aren't even the leftover grapes of Ephraim's harvest better than the entire crop of my little clan of Abiezer?
07Jdg 8:3 God gave you victory over Oreb and Zeeb, the commanders of the Midianite army. What have I accomplished compared to that?" When the men of Ephraim heard Gideon's answer, their anger subsided.
07Jdg 8:4 Gideon then crossed the Jordan River with his 300 men, and though exhausted, they continued to chase the enemy.
07Jdg 8:5 When they reached Succoth, Gideon asked the leaders of the town, "Please give my warriors some food. They are very tired. I am chasing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
07Jdg 8:6 But the officials of Succoth replied, "Catch Zebah and Zalmunna first, and then we will feed your army."
07Jdg 8:7 So Gideon said, "After the LORD gives me victory over Zebah and Zalmunna, I will return and tear your flesh with the thorns and briers from the wilderness."
07Jdg 8:8 From there Gideon went up to Peniel¨ç and again asked for food, but he got the same answer. / ¨ç{Hebrew Penuel, a variant spelling of Peniel; also in 8.9, 17}
07Jdg 8:9 So he said to the people of Peniel, "After I return in victory, I will tear down this tower."
07Jdg 8:10 By this time Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with 15,000 warriors - all that remained of the allied armies of the east, for 120,000 had already been killed.
07Jdg 8:11 Gideon circled around by the caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah, taking the Midianite army by surprise.
07Jdg 8:12 Zebah and Zalmunna, the two Midianite kings, fled, but Gideon chased them down and captured all their warriors.
07Jdg 8:13 After this, Gideon returned from the battle by way of Heres Pass.
07Jdg 8:14 There he captured a young man from Succoth and demanded that he write down the names of all the seventy-seven officials and elders in the town.
07Jdg 8:15 Gideon then returned to Succoth and said to the leaders, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. When we were here before, you taunted me, saying, 'Catch Zebah and Zalmunna first, and then we will feed your exhausted army.'"
07Jdg 8:16 Then Gideon took the elders of the town and taught them a lesson, punishing them with thorns and briers from the wilderness.
07Jdg 8:17 He also tore down the tower of Peniel and killed all the men in the town.
07Jdg 8:18 Then Gideon asked Zebah and Zalmunna, "The men you killed at Tabor - what were they like?" "Like you," they replied. "They all had the look of a king's son."
07Jdg 8:19 "They were my brothers, the sons of my own mother!" Gideon exclaimed. "As surely as the LORD lives, I wouldn't kill you if you hadn't killed them."
07Jdg 8:20 Turning to Jether, his oldest son, he said, "Kill them!" But Jether did not draw his sword, for he was only a boy and was afraid.
07Jdg 8:21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said to Gideon, "Be a man! Kill us yourself!" So Gideon killed them both and took the royal ornaments from the necks of their camels.
07Jdg 8:22 Then the Israelites said to Gideon, "Be our ruler! You and your son and your grandson will be our rulers, for you have rescued us from Midian."
07Jdg 8:23 But Gideon replied, "I will not rule over you, nor will my son. The LORD will rule over you!
07Jdg 8:24 However, I do have one request - that each of you give me an earring from the plunder you collected from your fallen enemies." (The enemies, being Ishmaelites, all wore gold earrings.)
07Jdg 8:25 "Gladly!" they replied. They spread out a cloak, and each one threw in a gold earring he had gathered from the plunder.
07Jdg 8:26 The weight of the gold earrings was forty-three pounds¨ç, not including the royal ornaments and pendants, the purple clothing worn by the kings of Midian, or the chains around the necks of their camels. / ¨ç{Hebrew 1,700 shekels [19.4 kilograms]}
07Jdg 8:27 Gideon made a sacred ephod from the gold and put it in Ophrah, his hometown. But soon all the Israelites prostituted themselves by worshiping it, and it became a trap for Gideon and his family.
07Jdg 8:28 That is the story of how the people of Israel defeated Midian, which never recovered. Throughout the rest of Gideon's lifetime - about forty years - there was peace in the land.
07Jdg 8:29 Then Gideon¨ç son of Joash returned home. / ¨ç{Hebrew Jerub-baal; see 6.32}
07Jdg 8:30 He had seventy sons born to him, for he had many wives.
07Jdg 8:31 He also had a concubine in Shechem, who gave birth to a son, whom he named Abimelech.
07Jdg 8:32 Gideon died when he was very old, and he was buried in the grave of his father, Joash, at Ophrah in the land of the clan of Abiezer.
07Jdg 8:33 As soon as Gideon died, the Israelites prostituted themselves by worshiping the images of Baal, making Baal-berith their god.
07Jdg 8:34 They forgot the LORD their God, who had rescued them from all their enemies surrounding them.
07Jdg 8:35 Nor did they show any loyalty to the family of Jerub-baal (that is, Gideon), despite all the good he had done for Israel.
07Jdg 9:1 One day Gideon's¨ç son Abimelech went to Shechem to visit his uncles - his mother's brothers. He said to them and to the rest of his mother's family, / ¨ç{Hebrew Jerub-baal's (see 6.32); also in 9.2, 24}
07Jdg 9:2 "Ask the leading citizens of Shechem whether they want to be ruled by all seventy of Gideon's sons or by one man. And remember that I am your own flesh and blood!"
07Jdg 9:3 So Abimelech's uncles gave his message to all the citizens of Shechem on his behalf. And after listening to this proposal, the people of Shechem decided in favor of Abimelech because he was their relative.
07Jdg 9:4 They gave him seventy silver coins from the temple of Baal-berith, which he used to hire some reckless troublemakers who agreed to follow him.
07Jdg 9:5 He went to his father's home at Ophrah, and there, on one stone, they killed all seventy of his half brothers, the sons of Gideon¨ç. But the youngest brother, Jotham, escaped and hid. / ¨ç{Hebrew Jerub-baal (see 6.32); also in 9.16, 19, 28, 57}
07Jdg 9:6 Then all the leading citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo called a meeting under the oak beside the pillar¨ç at Shechem and made Abimelech their king. / ¨ç{The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
07Jdg 9:7 When Jotham heard about this, he climbed to the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted, "Listen to me, citizens of Shechem! Listen to me if you want God to listen to you!
07Jdg 9:8 Once upon a time the trees decided to choose a king.First they said to the olive tree, 'Be our king!'
07Jdg 9:9 But the olive tree refused, saying, 'Should I quit producing the olive oil that blesses both God and people, just to wave back and forth over the trees?'
07Jdg 9:10 "Then they said to the fig tree, 'You be our king!'
07Jdg 9:11 But the fig tree also refused, saying, 'Should I quit producing my sweet fruit just to wave back and forth over the trees?'
07Jdg 9:12 "Then they said to the grapevine, 'You be our king!'
07Jdg 9:13 But the grapevine also refused, saying, 'Should I quit producing the wine that cheers both God and people, just to wave back and forth over the trees?'
07Jdg 9:14 "Then all the trees finally turned to the thornbush and said, 'Come, you be our king!'
07Jdg 9:15 And the thornbush replied to the trees, 'If you truly want to make me your king, come and take shelter in my shade. If not, let fire come out from me and devour the cedars of Lebanon.'"
07Jdg 9:16 Jotham continued, "Now make sure you have acted honorably and in good faith by making Abimelech your king, and that you have done right by Gideon and all of his descendants. Have you treated him with the honor he deserves for all he accomplished?
07Jdg 9:17 For he fought for you and risked his life when he rescued you from the Midianites.
07Jdg 9:18 But today you have revolted against my father and his descendants, killing his seventy sons on one stone. And you have chosen his slave woman's son, Abimelech, to be your king just because he is your relative.
07Jdg 9:19 "If you have acted honorably and in good faith toward Gideon and his descendants today, then may you find joy in Abimelech, and may he find joy in you.
07Jdg 9:20 But if you have not acted in good faith, then may fire come out from Abimelech and devour the leading citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo; and may fire come out from the citizens of Shechem and Beth-millo and devour Abimelech!"
07Jdg 9:21 Then Jotham escaped and lived in Beer because he was afraid of his brother Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:22 After Abimelech had ruled over Israel for three years,
07Jdg 9:23 God sent a spirit that stirred up trouble between Abimelech and the leading citizens of Shechem, and they revolted.
07Jdg 9:24 God was punishing Abimelech for murdering Gideon's seventy sons, and the citizens of Shechem for supporting him in this treachery of murdering his brothers.
07Jdg 9:25 The citizens of Shechem set an ambush for Abimelech on the hilltops and robbed everyone who passed that way. But someone warned Abimelech about their plot.
07Jdg 9:26 One day Gaal son of Ebed moved to Shechem with his brothers and gained the confidence of the leading citizens of Shechem.
07Jdg 9:27 During the annual harvest festival at Shechem, held in the temple of the local god, the wine flowed freely, and everyone began cursing Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:28 "Who is Abimelech?" Gaal shouted. "He's not a true son of Shechem¨ç, so why should we be his servants? He's merely the son of Gideon, and this Zebul is merely his deputy. Serve the true sons of Hamor, the founder of Shechem. Why should we serve Abimelech? / ¨ç{Hebrew Who is Shechem?}
07Jdg 9:29 If I were in charge here, I would get rid of Abimelech. I would say¨ç to him, 'Get some soldiers, and come out and fight!'" / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads And he said}
07Jdg 9:30 But when Zebul, the leader of the city, heard what Gaal was saying, he was furious.
07Jdg 9:31 He sent messengers to Abimelech in Arumah¨ç, telling him, "Gaal son of Ebed and his brothers have come to live in Shechem, and now they are inciting the city to rebel against you. / ¨ç{Or in secret; Hebrew reads in Tormah; compare 9.41}
07Jdg 9:32 Come by night with an army and hide out in the fields.
07Jdg 9:33 In the morning, as soon as it is daylight, attack the city. When Gaal and those who are with him come out against you, you can do with them as you wish."
07Jdg 9:34 So Abimelech and all his men went by night and split into four groups, stationing themselves around Shechem.
07Jdg 9:35 Gaal was standing at the city gates when Abimelech and his army came out of hiding.
07Jdg 9:36 When Gaal saw them, he said to Zebul, "Look, there are people coming down from the hilltops!" Zebul replied, "It's just the shadows on the hills that look like men."
07Jdg 9:37 But again Gaal said, "No, people are coming down from the hills¨ç. And another group is coming down the road past the Diviners' Oak¨è." / ¨ç{Or the center of the land} ¨è{Hebrew Elon-meonenim}
07Jdg 9:38 Then Zebul turned on him and asked, "Now where is that big mouth of yours? Wasn't it you that said, 'Who is Abimelech, and why should we be his servants?' The men you mocked are right outside the city! Go out and fight them!"
07Jdg 9:39 So Gaal led the leading citizens of Shechem into battle against Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:40 But Abimelech chased him, and many of Shechem's men were wounded and fell along the road as they retreated to the city gate.
07Jdg 9:41 Abimelech returned to Arumah, and Zebul drove Gaal and his brothers out of Shechem.
07Jdg 9:42 The next day the people of Shechem went out into the fields to battle. When Abimelech heard about it,
07Jdg 9:43 he divided his men into three groups and set an ambush in the fields. When Abimelech saw the people coming out of the city, he and his men jumped up from their hiding places and attacked them.
07Jdg 9:44 Abimelech and his group stormed the city gate to keep the men of Shechem from getting back in, while Abimelech's other two groups cut them down in the fields.
07Jdg 9:45 The battle went on all day before Abimelech finally captured the city. He killed the people, leveled the city, and scattered salt all over the ground.
07Jdg 9:46 When the leading citizens who lived in the tower of Shechem heard what had happened, they ran and hid in the temple of Baal-berith¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew El-berith, another name for Baal-berith; compare 9.4}
07Jdg 9:47 Someone reported to Abimelech that the citizens had gathered in the temple,
07Jdg 9:48 so he led his forces to Mount Zalmon. He took an ax and chopped some branches from a tree, then put them on his shoulder. "Quick, do as I have done!" he told his men.
07Jdg 9:49 So each of them cut down some branches, following Abimelech's example. They piled the branches against the walls of the temple and set them on fire. So all the people who had lived in the tower of Shechem died - about 1,000 men and women.
07Jdg 9:50 Then Abimelech attacked the town of Thebez and captured it.
07Jdg 9:51 But there was a strong tower inside the town, and all the men and women - the entire population - fled to it. They barricaded themselves in and climbed up to the roof of the tower.
07Jdg 9:52 Abimelech followed them to attack the tower. But as he prepared to set fire to the entrance,
07Jdg 9:53 a woman on the roof dropped a millstone that landed on Abimelech's head and crushed his skull.
07Jdg 9:54 He quickly said to his young armor bearer, "Draw your sword and kill me! Don't let it be said that a woman killed Abimelech!" So the young man ran him through with his sword, and he died.
07Jdg 9:55 When Abimelech's men saw that he was dead, they disbanded and returned to their homes.
07Jdg 9:56 In this way, God punished Abimelech for the evil he had done against his father by murdering his seventy brothers.
07Jdg 9:57 God also punished the men of Shechem for all their evil. So the curse of Jotham son of Gideon was fulfilled.
07Jdg 10:1 After Abimelech died, Tola son of Puah, son of Dodo, was the next person to rescue Israel. He was from the tribe of Issachar but lived in the town of Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim.
07Jdg 10:2 He judged Israel for twenty-three years. When he died, he was buried in Shamir.
07Jdg 10:3 After Tola died, Jair from Gilead judged Israel for twenty-two years.
07Jdg 10:4 His thirty sons rode around on thirty donkeys, and they owned thirty towns in the land of Gilead, which are still called the Towns of Jair¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew Havvoth-jair}
07Jdg 10:5 When Jair died, he was buried in Kamon.
07Jdg 10:6 Again the Israelites did evil in the LORD's sight. They served the images of Baal and Ashtoreth, and the gods of Aram, Sidon, Moab, Ammon, and Philistia. They abandoned the LORD and no longer served him at all.
07Jdg 10:7 So the LORD burned with anger against Israel, and he turned them over to the Philistines and the Ammonites,
07Jdg 10:8 who began to oppress them that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites east of the Jordan River in the land of the Amorites (that is, in Gilead).
07Jdg 10:9 The Ammonites also crossed to the west side of the Jordan and attacked Judah, Benjamin, and Ephraim.The Israelites were in great distress.
07Jdg 10:10 Finally, they cried out to the LORD for help, saying, "We have sinned against you because we have abandoned you as our God and have served the images of Baal."
07Jdg 10:11 The LORD replied, "Did I not rescue you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, the Philistines,
07Jdg 10:12 the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites? When they oppressed you, you cried out to me for help, and I rescued you.
07Jdg 10:13 Yet you have abandoned me and served other gods. So I will not rescue you anymore.
07Jdg 10:14 Go and cry out to the gods you have chosen! Let them rescue you in your hour of distress!"
07Jdg 10:15 But the Israelites pleaded with the LORD and said, "We have sinned. Punish us as you see fit, only rescue us today from our enemies."
07Jdg 10:16 Then the Israelites put aside their foreign gods and served the LORD. And he was grieved by their misery.
07Jdg 10:17 At that time the armies of Ammon had gathered for war and were camped in Gilead, and the people of Israel assembled and camped at Mizpah.
07Jdg 10:18 The leaders of Gilead said to each other, "Whoever attacks the Ammonites first will become ruler over all the people of Gilead."
07Jdg 11:1 Now Jephthah of Gilead was a great warrior. He was the son of Gilead, but his mother was a prostitute.
07Jdg 11:2 Gilead's wife also had several sons, and when these half brothers grew up, they chased Jephthah off the land. "You will not get any of our father's inheritance," they said, "for you are the son of a prostitute."
07Jdg 11:3 So Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob. Soon he had a band of worthless rebels following him.
07Jdg 11:4 At about this time, the Ammonites began their war against Israel.
07Jdg 11:5 When the Ammonites attacked, the elders of Gilead sent for Jephthah in the land of Tob. The elders said,
07Jdg 11:6 "Come and be our commander! Help us fight the Ammonites!"
07Jdg 11:7 But Jephthah said to them, "Aren't you the ones who hated me and drove me from my father's house? Why do you come to me now when you're in trouble?"
07Jdg 11:8 "Because we need you," the elders replied. "If you lead us in battle against the Ammonites, we will make you ruler over all the people of Gilead."
07Jdg 11:9 Jephthah said to the elders, "Let me get this straight. If I come with you and if the LORD gives me victory over the Ammonites, will you really make me ruler over all the people?"
07Jdg 11:10 "The LORD is our witness," the elders replied. "We promise to do whatever you say."
07Jdg 11:11 So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him their ruler and commander of the army. At Mizpah, in the presence of the LORD, Jephthah repeated what he had said to the elders.
07Jdg 11:12 Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of Ammon, asking, "Why have you come out to fight against my land?"
07Jdg 11:13 The king of Ammon answered Jephthah's messengers, "When the Israelites came out of Egypt, they stole my land from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River and all the way to the Jordan. Now then, give back the land peaceably."
07Jdg 11:14 Jephthah sent this message back to the Ammonite king.
07Jdg 11:15 "This is what Jephthah says£º Israel did not steal any land from Moab or Ammon.
07Jdg 11:16 When the people of Israel arrived at Kadesh on their journey from Egypt after crossing the Red Sea¨ç, / ¨ç{Hebrew sea of reeds}
07Jdg 11:17 they sent messengers to the king of Edom asking for permission to pass through his land. But their request was denied. Then they asked the king of Moab for similar permission, but he wouldn't let them pass through either. So the people of Israel stayed in Kadesh.
07Jdg 11:18 "Finally, they went around Edom and Moab through the wilderness. They traveled along Moab's eastern border and camped on the other side of the Arnon River. But they never once crossed the Arnon River into Moab, for the Arnon was the border of Moab.
07Jdg 11:19 "Then Israel sent messengers to King Sihon of the Amorites, who ruled from Heshbon, asking for permission to cross through his land to get to their destination.
07Jdg 11:20 But King Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his land. Instead, he mobilized his army at Jahaz and attacked them.
07Jdg 11:21 But the LORD, the God of Israel, gave his people victory over King Sihon. So Israel took control of all the land of the Amorites, who lived in that region,
07Jdg 11:22 from the Arnon River to the Jabbok River, and from the eastern wilderness to the Jordan.
07Jdg 11:23 "So you see, it was the LORD, the God of Israel, who took away the land from the Amorites and gave it to Israel. Why, then, should we give it back to you?
07Jdg 11:24 You keep whatever your god Chemosh gives you, and we will keep whatever the LORD our God gives us.
07Jdg 11:25 Are you any better than Balak son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he try to make a case against Israel for disputed land? Did he go to war against them?
07Jdg 11:26 "Israel has been living here for 300 years, inhabiting Heshbon and its surrounding settlements, all the way to Aroer and its settlements, and in all the towns along the Arnon River. Why have you made no effort to recover it before now?
07Jdg 11:27 Therefore, I have not sinned against you. Rather, you have wronged me by attacking me. Let the LORD, who is judge, decide today which of us is right - Israel or Ammon."
07Jdg 11:28 But the king of Ammon paid no attention to Jephthah's message.
07Jdg 11:29 At that time the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he went throughout the land of Gilead and Manasseh, including Mizpah in Gilead, and from there he led an army against the Ammonites.
07Jdg 11:30 And Jephthah made a vow to the LORD. He said, "If you give me victory over the Ammonites,
07Jdg 11:31 I will give to the LORD whatever comes out of my house to meet me when I return in triumph. I will sacrifice it as a burnt offering."
07Jdg 11:32 So Jephthah led his army against the Ammonites, and the LORD gave him victory.
07Jdg 11:33 He crushed the Ammonites, devastating about twenty towns from Aroer to an area near Minnith and as far away as Abel-keramim. In this way Israel defeated the Ammonites.
07Jdg 11:34 When Jephthah returned home to Mizpah, his daughter came out to meet him, playing on a tambourine and dancing for joy. She was his one and only child; he had no other sons or daughters.
07Jdg 11:35 When he saw her, he tore his clothes in anguish. "Oh, my daughter!" he cried out. "You have completely destroyed me! You've brought disaster on me! For I have made a vow to the LORD, and I cannot take it back."
07Jdg 11:36 And she said, "Father, if you have made a vow to the LORD, you must do to me what you have vowed, for the LORD has given you a great victory over your enemies, the Ammonites.
07Jdg 11:37 But first let me do this one thing£º Let me go up and roam in the hills and weep with my friends for two months, because I will die a virgin."
07Jdg 11:38 "You may go," Jephthah said. And he sent her away for two months. She and her friends went into the hills and wept because she would never have children.
07Jdg 11:39 When she returned home, her father kept the vow he had made, and she died a virgin. So it has become a custom in Israel
07Jdg 11:40 for young Israelite women to go away for four days each year to lament the fate of Jephthah's daughter.
07Jdg 12:1 Then the people of Ephraim mobilized an army and crossed over the Jordan River to Zaphon. They sent this message to Jephthah£º "Why didn't you call for us to help you fight against the Ammonites? We are going to burn down your house with you in it!"
07Jdg 12:2 Jephthah replied, "I summoned you at the beginning of the dispute, but you refused to come! You failed to help us in our struggle against Ammon.
07Jdg 12:3 So when I realized you weren't coming, I risked my life and went to battle without you, and the LORD gave me victory over the Ammonites. So why have you now come to fight me?"
07Jdg 12:4 The people of Ephraim responded, "You men of Gilead are nothing more than fugitives from Ephraim and Manasseh." So Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and attacked the men of Ephraim and defeated them.
07Jdg 12:5 Jephthah captured the shallow crossings of the Jordan River, and whenever a fugitive from Ephraim tried to go back across, the men of Gilead would challenge him. "Are you a member of the tribe of Ephraim?" they would ask. If the man said, "No, I'm not,"
07Jdg 12:6 they would tell him to say "Shibboleth." If he was from Ephraim, he would say "Sibboleth," because people from Ephraim cannot pronounce the word correctly. Then they would take him and kill him at the shallow crossings of the Jordan. In all, 42,000 Ephraimites were killed at that time.
07Jdg 12:7 Jephthah judged Israel for six years. When he died, he was buried in one of the towns of Gilead.
07Jdg 12:8 After Jephthah died, Ibzan from Bethlehem judged Israel.
07Jdg 12:9 He had thirty sons and thirty daughters. He sent his daughters to marry men outside his clan, and he brought in thirty young women from outside his clan to marry his sons. Ibzan judged Israel for seven years.
07Jdg 12:10 When he died, he was buried at Bethlehem.
07Jdg 12:11 After Ibzan died, Elon from the tribe of Zebulun judged Israel for ten years.
07Jdg 12:12 When he died, he was buried at Aijalon in Zebulun.
07Jdg 12:13 After Elon died, Abdon son of Hillel, from Pirathon, judged Israel.
07Jdg 12:14 He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys. He judged Israel for eight years.
07Jdg 12:15 When he died, he was buried at Pirathon in Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.
07Jdg 13:1 Again the Israelites did evil in the LORD's sight, so the LORD handed them over to the Philistines, who oppressed them for forty years.
07Jdg 13:2 In those days a man named Manoah from the tribe of Dan lived in the town of Zorah. His wife was unable to become pregnant, and they had no children.
07Jdg 13:3 The angel of the LORD appeared to Manoah's wife and said, "Even though you have been unable to have children, you will soon become pregnant and give birth to a son.
07Jdg 13:4 So be careful; you must not drink wine or any other alcoholic drink nor eat any forbidden food¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew any unclean thing; also in 13.7, 14}
07Jdg 13:5 You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and his hair must never be cut. For he will be dedicated to God as a Nazirite from birth. He will begin to rescue Israel from the Philistines."
07Jdg 13:6 The woman ran and told her husband, "A man of God appeared to me! He looked like one of God's angels, terrifying to see. I didn't ask where he was from, and he didn't tell me his name.
07Jdg 13:7 But he told me, 'You will become pregnant and give birth to a son. You must not drink wine or any other alcoholic drink nor eat any forbidden food. For your son will be dedicated to God as a Nazirite from the moment of his birth until the day of his death.'"
07Jdg 13:8 Then Manoah prayed to the LORD, saying, "Lord, please let the man of God come back to us again and give us more instructions about this son who is to be born."
07Jdg 13:9 God answered Manoah's prayer, and the angel of God appeared once again to his wife as she was sitting in the field. But her husband, Manoah, was not with her.
07Jdg 13:10 So she quickly ran and told her husband, "The man who appeared to me the other day is here again!"
07Jdg 13:11 Manoah ran back with his wife and asked, "Are you the man who spoke to my wife the other day?" "Yes," he replied, "I am."
07Jdg 13:12 So Manoah asked him, "When your words come true, what kind of rules should govern the boy's life and work?"
07Jdg 13:13 The angel of the LORD replied, "Be sure your wife follows the instructions I gave her.
07Jdg 13:14 She must not eat grapes or raisins, drink wine or any other alcoholic drink, or eat any forbidden food."
07Jdg 13:15 Then Manoah said to the angel of the LORD, "Please stay here until we can prepare a young goat for you to eat."
07Jdg 13:16 "I will stay," the angel of the LORD replied, "but I will not eat anything. However, you may prepare a burnt offering as a sacrifice to the LORD." (Manoah didn't realize it was the angel of the LORD.)
07Jdg 13:17 Then Manoah asked the angel of the LORD, "What is your name? For when all this comes true, we want to honor you."
07Jdg 13:18 "Why do you ask my name?" the angel of the LORD replied. "It is too wonderful for you to understand."
07Jdg 13:19 Then Manoah took a young goat and a grain offering and offered it on a rock as a sacrifice to the LORD. And as Manoah and his wife watched, the LORD did an amazing thing.
07Jdg 13:20 As the flames from the altar shot up toward the sky, the angel of the LORD ascended in the fire. When Manoah and his wife saw this, they fell with their faces to the ground.
07Jdg 13:21 The angel did not appear again to Manoah and his wife. Manoah finally realized it was the angel of the LORD,
07Jdg 13:22 and he said to his wife, "We will certainly die, for we have seen God!"
07Jdg 13:23 But his wife said, "If the LORD were going to kill us, he wouldn't have accepted our burnt offering and grain offering. He wouldn't have appeared to us and told us this wonderful thing and done these miracles."
07Jdg 13:24 When her son was born, she named him Samson. And the LORD blessed him as he grew up.
07Jdg 13:25 And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him while he lived in Mahaneh-dan, which is located between the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol.
07Jdg 14:1 One day when Samson was in Timnah, one of the Philistine women caught his eye.
07Jdg 14:2 When he returned home, he told his father and mother, "A young Philistine woman in Timnah caught my eye. I want to marry her. Get her for me."
07Jdg 14:3 His father and mother objected. "Isn't there even one woman in our tribe or among all the Israelites you could marry?" they asked. "Why must you go to the pagan Philistines to find a wife?" But Samson told his father, "Get her for me! She looks good to me."
07Jdg 14:4 His father and mother didn't realize the LORD was at work in this, creating an opportunity to work against the Philistines, who ruled over Israel at that time.
07Jdg 14:5 As Samson and his parents were going down to Timnah, a young lion suddenly attacked Samson near the vineyards of Timnah.
07Jdg 14:6 At that moment the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him, and he ripped the lion's jaws apart with his bare hands. He did it as easily as if it were a young goat. But he didn't tell his father or mother about it.
07Jdg 14:7 When Samson arrived in Timnah, he talked with the woman and was very pleased with her.
07Jdg 14:8 Later, when he returned to Timnah for the wedding, he turned off the path to look at the carcass of the lion. And he found that a swarm of bees had made some honey in the carcass.
07Jdg 14:9 He scooped some of the honey into his hands and ate it along the way. He also gave some to his father and mother, and they ate it. But he didn't tell them he had taken the honey from the carcass of the lion.
07Jdg 14:10 As his father was making final arrangements for the marriage, Samson threw a party at Timnah, as was the custom for elite young men.
07Jdg 14:11 When the bride's parents¨ç saw him, they selected thirty young men from the town to be his companions. / ¨ç{Hebrew they}
07Jdg 14:12 Samson said to them, "Let me tell you a riddle. If you solve my riddle during these seven days of the celebration, I will give you thirty fine linen robes and thirty sets of festive clothing.
07Jdg 14:13 But if you can't solve it, then you must give me thirty fine linen robes and thirty sets of festive clothing." "All right," they agreed, "let's hear your riddle."
07Jdg 14:14 So he said£º "Out of the one who eats came something to eat; out of the strong came something sweet." Three days later they were still trying to figure it out.
07Jdg 14:15 On the fourth¨ç day they said to Samson's wife, "Entice your husband to explain the riddle for us, or we will burn down your father's house with you in it. Did you invite us to this party just to make us poor?" / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads seventh}
07Jdg 14:16 So Samson's wife came to him in tears and said, "You don't love me; you hate me! You have given my people a riddle, but you haven't told me the answer." "I haven't even given the answer to my father or mother," he replied. "Why should I tell you?"
07Jdg 14:17 So she cried whenever she was with him and kept it up for the rest of the celebration. At last, on the seventh day he told her the answer because she was tormenting him with her nagging. Then she explained the riddle to the young men.
07Jdg 14:18 So before sunset of the seventh day, the men of the town came to Samson with their answer£º "What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion?" Samson replied, "If you hadn't plowed with my heifer, you wouldn't have solved my riddle!"
07Jdg 14:19 Then the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon him. He went down to the town of Ashkelon, killed thirty men, took their belongings, and gave their clothing to the men who had solved his riddle. But Samson was furious about what had happened, and he went back home to live with his father and mother.
07Jdg 14:20 So his wife was given in marriage to the man who had been Samson's best man at the wedding.
07Jdg 15:1 Later on, during the wheat harvest, Samson took a young goat as a present to his wife. He said, "I'm going into my wife's room to sleep with her," but her father wouldn't let him in.
07Jdg 15:2 "I truly thought you must hate her," her father explained, "so I gave her in marriage to your best man. But look, her younger sister is even more beautiful than she is. Marry her instead."
07Jdg 15:3 Samson said, "This time I cannot be blamed for everything I am going to do to you Philistines."
07Jdg 15:4 Then he went out and caught 300 foxes. He tied their tails together in pairs, and he fastened a torch to each pair of tails.
07Jdg 15:5 Then he lit the torches and let the foxes run through the grain fields of the Philistines. He burned all their grain to the ground, including the sheaves and the uncut grain. He also destroyed their vineyards and olive groves.
07Jdg 15:6 "Who did this?" the Philistines demanded. "Samson," was the reply, "because his father-in-law from Timnah gave Samson's wife to be married to his best man." So the Philistines went and got the woman and her father and burned them to death.
07Jdg 15:7 "Because you did this," Samson vowed, "I won't rest until I take my revenge on you!"
07Jdg 15:8 So he attacked the Philistines with great fury and killed many of them. Then he went to live in a cave in the rock of Etam.
07Jdg 15:9 The Philistines retaliated by setting up camp in Judah and spreading out near the town of Lehi.
07Jdg 15:10 The men of Judah asked the Philistines, "Why are you attacking us?" The Philistines replied, "We've come to capture Samson. We've come to pay him back for what he did to us."
07Jdg 15:11 So 3,000 men of Judah went down to get Samson at the cave in the rock of Etam. They said to Samson, "Don't you realize the Philistines rule over us? What are you doing to us?" But Samson replied, "I only did to them what they did to me."
07Jdg 15:12 But the men of Judah told him, "We have come to tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines." "All right," Samson said. "But promise that you won't kill me yourselves."
07Jdg 15:13 "We will only tie you up and hand you over to the Philistines," they replied. "We won't kill you." So they tied him up with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock.
07Jdg 15:14 As Samson arrived at Lehi, the Philistines came shouting in triumph. But the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon Samson, and he snapped the ropes on his arms as if they were burnt strands of flax, and they fell from his wrists.
07Jdg 15:15 Then he found the jawbone of a recently killed donkey. He picked it up and killed 1,000 Philistines with it.
07Jdg 15:16 Then Samson said, "With the jawbone of a donkey, I've piled them in heaps! With the jawbone of a donkey, I've killed a thousand men!"
07Jdg 15:17 When he finished his boasting, he threw away the jawbone; and the place was named Jawbone Hill¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew Ramath-lehi}
07Jdg 15:18 Samson was now very thirsty, and he cried out to the LORD, "You have accomplished this great victory by the strength of your servant. Must I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of these pagans?"
07Jdg 15:19 So God caused water to gush out of a hollow in the ground at Lehi, and Samson was revived as he drank. Then he named that place "The Spring of the One Who Cried Out,"¨ç and it is still in Lehi to this day. / ¨ç{Hebrew En-hakkore}
07Jdg 15:20 Samson judged Israel for twenty years during the period when the Philistines dominated the land.
07Jdg 16:1 One day Samson went to the Philistine town of Gaza and spent the night with a prostitute.
07Jdg 16:2 Word soon spread¨ç that Samson was there, so the men of Gaza gathered together and waited all night at the town gates. They kept quiet during the night, saying to themselves, "When the light of morning comes, we will kill him." / ¨ç{As in Greek and Syriac versions and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew lacks Word soon spread}
07Jdg 16:3 But Samson stayed in bed only until midnight. Then he got up, took hold of the doors of the town gate, including the two posts, and lifted them up, bar and all. He put them on his shoulders and carried them all the way to the top of the hill across from Hebron.
07Jdg 16:4 Some time later Samson fell in love with a woman named Delilah, who lived in the valley of Sorek.
07Jdg 16:5 The rulers of the Philistines went to her and said, "Entice Samson to tell you what makes him so strong and how he can be overpowered and tied up securely. Then each of us will give you 1,100 pieces¨ç of silver." / ¨ç{Hebrew 1,100 shekels, about 28 pounds or 12.5 kilograms in weight}
07Jdg 16:6 So Delilah said to Samson, "Please tell me what makes you so strong and what it would take to tie you up securely."
07Jdg 16:7 Samson replied, "If I were tied up with seven new bowstrings that have not yet been dried, I would become as weak as anyone else."
07Jdg 16:8 So the Philistine rulers brought Delilah seven new bowstrings, and she tied Samson up with them.
07Jdg 16:9 She had hidden some men in one of the inner rooms of her house, and she cried out, "Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!" But Samson snapped the bowstrings as a piece of string snaps when it is burned by a fire. So the secret of his strength was not discovered.
07Jdg 16:10 Afterward Delilah said to him, "You've been making fun of me and telling me lies! Now please tell me how you can be tied up securely."
07Jdg 16:11 Samson replied, "If I were tied up with brand-new ropes that had never been used, I would become as weak as anyone else."
07Jdg 16:12 So Delilah took new ropes and tied him up with them. The men were hiding in the inner room as before, and again Delilah cried out, "Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!" But again Samson snapped the ropes from his arms as if they were thread.
07Jdg 16:13 Then Delilah said, "You've been making fun of me and telling me lies! Now tell me how you can be tied up securely." Samson replied, "If you were to weave the seven braids of my hair into the fabric on your loom and tighten it with the loom shuttle, I would become as weak as anyone else." So while he slept, Delilah wove the seven braids of his hair into the fabric.
07Jdg 16:14 Then she tightened it with the loom shuttle¨ç. Again she cried out, "Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!" But Samson woke up, pulled back the loom shuttle, and yanked his hair away from the loom and the fabric. / ¨ç{As in Greek version and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew lacks I would become as weak as anyone else. So while he slept, Delilah wove the seven braids of his hair into the fabric. 14Then she tightened it with the loom shuttle}
07Jdg 16:15 Then Delilah pouted, "How can you tell me, 'I love you,' when you don't share your secrets with me? You've made fun of me three times now, and you still haven't told me what makes you so strong!"
07Jdg 16:16 She tormented him with her nagging day after day until he was sick to death of it.
07Jdg 16:17 Finally, Samson shared his secret with her. "My hair has never been cut," he confessed, "for I was dedicated to God as a Nazirite from birth. If my head were shaved, my strength would leave me, and I would become as weak as anyone else."
07Jdg 16:18 Delilah realized he had finally told her the truth, so she sent for the Philistine rulers. "Come back one more time," she said, "for he has finally told me his secret." So the Philistine rulers returned with the money in their hands.
07Jdg 16:19 Delilah lulled Samson to sleep with his head in her lap, and then she called in a man to shave off the seven locks of his hair. In this way she began to bring him down¨ç, and his strength left him. / ¨ç{Or she began to torment him. Greek version reads He began to grow weak}
07Jdg 16:20 Then she cried out, "Samson! The Philistines have come to capture you!" When he woke up, he thought, "I will do as before and shake myself free." But he didn't realize the LORD had left him.
07Jdg 16:21 So the Philistines captured him and gouged out his eyes. They took him to Gaza, where he was bound with bronze chains and forced to grind grain in the prison.
07Jdg 16:22 But before long, his hair began to grow back.
07Jdg 16:23 The Philistine rulers held a great festival, offering sacrifices and praising their god, Dagon. They said, "Our god has given us victory over our enemy Samson!"
07Jdg 16:24 When the people saw him, they praised their god, saying, "Our god has delivered our enemy to us! The one who killed so many of us is now in our power!"
07Jdg 16:25 Half drunk by now, the people demanded, "Bring out Samson so he can amuse us!" So he was brought from the prison to amuse them, and they had him stand between the pillars supporting the roof.
07Jdg 16:26 Samson said to the young servant who was leading him by the hand, "Place my hands against the pillars that hold up the temple. I want to rest against them."
07Jdg 16:27 Now the temple was completely filled with people. All the Philistine rulers were there, and there were about 3,000 men and women on the roof who were watching as Samson amused them.
07Jdg 16:28 Then Samson prayed to the LORD, "Sovereign LORD, remember me again. O God, please strengthen me just one more time. With one blow let me pay back the Philistines for the loss of my two eyes."
07Jdg 16:29 Then Samson put his hands on the two center pillars that held up the temple. Pushing against them with both hands,
07Jdg 16:30 he prayed, "Let me die with the Philistines." And the temple crashed down on the Philistine rulers and all the people. So he killed more people when he died than he had during his entire lifetime.
07Jdg 16:31 Later his brothers and other relatives went down to get his body. They took him back home and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol, where his father, Manoah, was buried. Samson had judged Israel for twenty years.
07Jdg 17:1 There was a man named Micah, who lived in the hill country of Ephraim.
07Jdg 17:2 One day he said to his mother, "I heard you place a curse on the person who stole 1,100 pieces¨ç of silver from you. Well, I have the money. I was the one who took it." "The LORD bless you for admitting it," his mother replied. / ¨ç{Hebrew 1,100 shekels, about 28 pounds or 12.5 kilograms in weight}
07Jdg 17:3 He returned the money to her, and she said, "I now dedicate these silver coins to the LORD. In honor of my son, I will have an image carved and an idol cast."
07Jdg 17:4 So when he returned the money to his mother, she took 200 silver coins and gave them to a silversmith, who made them into an image and an idol. And these were placed in Micah's house.
07Jdg 17:5 Micah set up a shrine for the idol, and he made a sacred ephod and some household idols. Then he installed one of his sons as his personal priest.
07Jdg 17:6 In those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes.
07Jdg 17:7 One day a young Levite, who had been living in Bethlehem in Judah, arrived in that area.
07Jdg 17:8 He had left Bethlehem in search of another place to live, and as he traveled, he came to the hill country of Ephraim. He happened to stop at Micah's house as he was traveling through.
07Jdg 17:9 "Where are you from?" Micah asked him.He replied, "I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am looking for a place to live."
07Jdg 17:10 "Stay here with me," Micah said, "and you can be a father and priest to me. I will give you ten pieces¨ç of silver a year, plus a change of clothes and your food." / ¨ç{Hebrew 10 shekels, about 4 ounces or 114 grams in weight}
07Jdg 17:11 The Levite agreed to this, and the young man became like one of Micah's sons.
07Jdg 17:12 So Micah installed the Levite as his personal priest, and he lived in Micah's house.
07Jdg 17:13 "I know the LORD will bless me now," Micah said, "because I have a Levite serving as my priest."
07Jdg 18:1 Now in those days Israel had no king. And the tribe of Dan was trying to find a place where they could settle, for they had not yet moved into the land assigned to them when the land was divided among the tribes of Israel.
07Jdg 18:2 So the men of Dan chose from their clans five capable warriors from the towns of Zorah and Eshtaol to scout out a land for them to settle in.When these warriors arrived in the hill country of Ephraim, they came to Micah's house and spent the night there.
07Jdg 18:3 While at Micah's house, they recognized the young Levite's accent, so they went over and asked him, "Who brought you here, and what are you doing in this place? Why are you here?"
07Jdg 18:4 He told them about his agreement with Micah and that he had been hired as Micah's personal priest.
07Jdg 18:5 Then they said, "Ask God whether or not our journey will be successful."
07Jdg 18:6 "Go in peace," the priest replied. "For the LORD is watching over your journey."
07Jdg 18:7 So the five men went on to the town of Laish, where they noticed the people living carefree lives, like the Sidonians; they were peaceful and secure¨ç. The people were also wealthy because their land was very fertile. And they lived a great distance from Sidon and had no allies nearby. / ¨ç{The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
07Jdg 18:8 When the men returned to Zorah and Eshtaol, their relatives asked them, "What did you find?"
07Jdg 18:9 The men replied, "Come on, let's attack them! We have seen the land, and it is very good. What are you waiting for? Don't hesitate to go and take possession of it.
07Jdg 18:10 When you get there, you will find the people living carefree lives. God has given us a spacious and fertile land, lacking in nothing!"
07Jdg 18:11 So 600 men from the tribe of Dan, armed with weapons of war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol.
07Jdg 18:12 They camped at a place west of Kiriath-jearim in Judah, which is called Mahaneh-dan¨ç to this day. / ¨ç{Mahaneh-dan means "the camp of Dan"}
07Jdg 18:13 Then they went on from there into the hill country of Ephraim and came to the house of Micah.
07Jdg 18:14 The five men who had scouted out the land around Laish explained to the others, "These buildings contain a sacred ephod, as well as some household idols, a carved image, and a cast idol. What do you think you should do?"
07Jdg 18:15 Then the five men turned off the road and went over to Micah's house, where the young Levite lived, and greeted him kindly.
07Jdg 18:16 As the 600 armed warriors from the tribe of Dan stood at the entrance of the gate,
07Jdg 18:17 the five scouts entered the shrine and removed the carved image, the sacred ephod, the household idols, and the cast idol. Meanwhile, the priest was standing at the gate with the 600 armed warriors.
07Jdg 18:18 When the priest saw the men carrying all the sacred objects out of Micah's shrine, he said, "What are you doing?"
07Jdg 18:19 "Be quiet and come with us," they said. "Be a father and priest to all of us. Isn't it better to be a priest for an entire tribe and clan of Israel than for the household of just one man?"
07Jdg 18:20 The young priest was quite happy to go with them, so he took along the sacred ephod, the household idols, and the carved image.
07Jdg 18:21 They turned and started on their way again, placing their children, livestock, and possessions in front of them.
07Jdg 18:22 When the people from the tribe of Dan were quite a distance from Micah's house, the people who lived near Micah came chasing after them.
07Jdg 18:23 They were shouting as they caught up with them. The men of Dan turned around and said to Micah, "What's the matter? Why have you called these men together and chased after us like this?"
07Jdg 18:24 "What do you mean, 'What's the matter?'" Micah replied. "You've taken away all the gods I have made, and my priest, and I have nothing left!"
07Jdg 18:25 The men of Dan said, "Watch what you say! There are some short-tempered men around here who might get angry and kill you and your family."
07Jdg 18:26 So the men of Dan continued on their way. When Micah saw that there were too many of them for him to attack, he turned around and went home.
07Jdg 18:27 Then, with Micah's idols and his priest, the men of Dan came to the town of Laish, whose people were peaceful and secure. They attacked with swords and burned the town to the ground.
07Jdg 18:28 There was no one to rescue the people, for they lived a great distance from Sidon and had no allies nearby. This happened in the valley near Beth-rehob. Then the people of the tribe of Dan rebuilt the town and lived there.
07Jdg 18:29 They renamed the town Dan after their ancestor, Israel's son, but it had originally been called Laish.
07Jdg 18:30 Then they set up the carved image, and they appointed Jonathan son of Gershom, son of Moses¨ç, as their priest. This family continued as priests for the tribe of Dan until the Exile. / ¨ç{As in an ancient Hebrew tradition, some Greek manuscripts, and Latin Vulgate; Masoretic Text reads son of Manasseh}
07Jdg 18:31 So Micah's carved image was worshiped by the tribe of Dan as long as the Tabernacle of God remained at Shiloh.
07Jdg 19:1 Now in those days Israel had no king. There was a man from the tribe of Levi living in a remote area of the hill country of Ephraim. One day he brought home a woman from Bethlehem in Judah to be his concubine.
07Jdg 19:2 But she became angry with him¨ç and returned to her father's home in Bethlehem.After about four months, / ¨ç{Or she was unfaithful to him}
07Jdg 19:3 her husband set out for Bethlehem to speak personally to her and persuade her to come back. He took with him a servant and a pair of donkeys. When he arrived at¨ç her father's house, her father saw him and welcomed him. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads When she brought him to}
07Jdg 19:4 Her father urged him to stay awhile, so he stayed three days, eating, drinking, and sleeping there.
07Jdg 19:5 On the fourth day the man was up early, ready to leave, but the woman's father said to his son-in-law, "Have something to eat before you go."
07Jdg 19:6 So the two men sat down together and had something to eat and drink. Then the woman's father said, "Please stay another night and enjoy yourself."
07Jdg 19:7 The man got up to leave, but his father-in-law kept urging him to stay, so he finally gave in and stayed the night.
07Jdg 19:8 On the morning of the fifth day he was up early again, ready to leave, and again the woman's father said, "Have something to eat; then you can leave later this afternoon." So they had another day of feasting.
07Jdg 19:9 Later, as the man and his concubine and servant were preparing to leave, his father-in-law said, "Look, it's almost evening. Stay the night and enjoy yourself. Tomorrow you can get up early and be on your way."
07Jdg 19:10 But this time the man was determined to leave. So he took his two saddled donkeys and his concubine and headed in the direction of Jebus (that is, Jerusalem).
07Jdg 19:11 It was late in the day when they neared Jebus, and the man's servant said to him, "Let's stop at this Jebusite town and spend the night there."
07Jdg 19:12 "No," his master said, "we can't stay in this foreign town where there are no Israelites. Instead, we will go on to Gibeah.
07Jdg 19:13 Come on, let's try to get as far as Gibeah or Ramah, and we'll spend the night in one of those towns."
07Jdg 19:14 So they went on. The sun was setting as they came to Gibeah, a town in the land of Benjamin,
07Jdg 19:15 so they stopped there to spend the night. They rested in the town square, but no one took them in for the night.
07Jdg 19:16 That evening an old man came home from his work in the fields. He was from the hill country of Ephraim, but he was living in Gibeah, where the people were from the tribe of Benjamin.
07Jdg 19:17 When he saw the travelers sitting in the town square, he asked them where they were from and where they were going.
07Jdg 19:18 "We have been in Bethlehem in Judah," the man replied. "We are on our way to a remote area in the hill country of Ephraim, which is my home. I traveled to Bethlehem, and now I'm returning home¨ç. But no one has taken us in for the night, / ¨ç{As in Greek version (see also 19.29); Hebrew reads now I'm going to the Tabernacle of the LORD}
07Jdg 19:19 even though we have everything we need. We have straw and feed for our donkeys and plenty of bread and wine for ourselves."
07Jdg 19:20 "You are welcome to stay with me," the old man said. "I will give you anything you might need. But whatever you do, don't spend the night in the square."
07Jdg 19:21 So he took them home with him and fed the donkeys. After they washed their feet, they ate and drank together.
07Jdg 19:22 While they were enjoying themselves, a crowd of troublemakers from the town surrounded the house. They began beating at the door and shouting to the old man, "Bring out the man who is staying with you so we can have sex with him."
07Jdg 19:23 The old man stepped outside to talk to them. "No, my brothers, don't do such an evil thing. For this man is a guest in my house, and such a thing would be shameful.
07Jdg 19:24 Here, take my virgin daughter and this man's concubine. I will bring them out to you, and you can abuse them and do whatever you like. But don't do such a shameful thing to this man."
07Jdg 19:25 But they wouldn't listen to him. So the Levite took hold of his concubine and pushed her out the door. The men of the town abused her all night, taking turns raping her until morning. Finally, at dawn they let her go.
07Jdg 19:26 At daybreak the woman returned to the house where her husband was staying. She collapsed at the door of the house and lay there until it was light.
07Jdg 19:27 When her husband opened the door to leave, there lay his concubine with her hands on the threshold.
07Jdg 19:28 He said, "Get up! Let's go!" But there was no answer¨ç. So he put her body on his donkey and took her home. / ¨ç{Greek version adds for she was dead}
07Jdg 19:29 When he got home, he took a knife and cut his concubine's body into twelve pieces. Then he sent one piece to each tribe throughout all the territory of Israel.
07Jdg 19:30 Everyone who saw it said, "Such a horrible crime has not been committed in all the time since Israel left Egypt. Think about it! What are we going to do? Who's going to speak up?"
07Jdg 20:1 Then all the Israelites were united as one man, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, including those from across the Jordan in the land of Gilead. The entire community assembled in the presence of the LORD at Mizpah.
07Jdg 20:2 The leaders of all the people and all the tribes of Israel - 400,000 warriors armed with swords - took their positions in the assembly of the people of God.
07Jdg 20:3 (Word soon reached the land of Benjamin that the other tribes had gone up to Mizpah.) The Israelites then asked how this terrible crime had happened.
07Jdg 20:4 The Levite, the husband of the woman who had been murdered, said, "My concubine and I came to spend the night in Gibeah, a town that belongs to the people of Benjamin.
07Jdg 20:5 That night some of the leading citizens of Gibeah surrounded the house, planning to kill me, and they raped my concubine until she was dead.
07Jdg 20:6 So I cut her body into twelve pieces and sent the pieces throughout the territory assigned to Israel, for these men have committed a terrible and shameful crime.
07Jdg 20:7 Now then, all of you - the entire community of Israel - must decide here and now what should be done about this!"
07Jdg 20:8 And all the people rose to their feet in unison and declared, "None of us will return home! No, not even one of us!
07Jdg 20:9 Instead, this is what we will do to Gibeah; we will draw lots to decide who will attack it.
07Jdg 20:10 One tenth of the men¨ç from each tribe will be chosen to supply the warriors with food, and the rest of us will take revenge on Gibeah¨è of Benjamin for this shameful thing they have done in Israel." / ¨ç{Hebrew 10 men from every hundred, 100 men from every thousand, and 1,000 men from every 10,000} ¨è{Hebrew Geba, in this case a variant spelling of Gibeah; also in 20.33}
07Jdg 20:11 So all the Israelites were completely united, and they gathered together to attack the town.
07Jdg 20:12 The Israelites sent messengers to the tribe of Benjamin, saying, "What a terrible thing has been done among you!
07Jdg 20:13 Give up those evil men, those troublemakers from Gibeah, so we can execute them and purge Israel of this evil." But the people of Benjamin would not listen.
07Jdg 20:14 Instead, they came from their towns and gathered at Gibeah to fight the Israelites.
07Jdg 20:15 In all, 26,000 of their warriors armed with swords arrived in Gibeah to join the 700 elite troops who lived there.
07Jdg 20:16 Among Benjamin's elite troops, 700 were left-handed, and each of them could sling a rock and hit a target within a hairsbreadth without missing.
07Jdg 20:17 Israel had 400,000 experienced soldiers armed with swords, not counting Benjamin's warriors.
07Jdg 20:18 Before the battle the Israelites went to Bethel and asked God, "Which tribe should go first to attack the people of Benjamin?" The LORD answered, "Judah is to go first."
07Jdg 20:19 So the Israelites left early the next morning and camped near Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:20 Then they advanced toward Gibeah to attack the men of Benjamin.
07Jdg 20:21 But Benjamin's warriors, who were defending the town, came out and killed 22,000 Israelites on the battlefield that day.
07Jdg 20:22 But the Israelites encouraged each other and took their positions again at the same place they had fought the previous day.
07Jdg 20:23 For they had gone up to Bethel and wept in the presence of the LORD until evening. They had asked the LORD, "Should we fight against our relatives from Benjamin again?" And the LORD had said, "Go out and fight against them."
07Jdg 20:24 So the next day they went out again to fight against the men of Benjamin,
07Jdg 20:25 but the men of Benjamin killed another 18,000 Israelites, all of whom were experienced with the sword.
07Jdg 20:26 Then all the Israelites went up to Bethel and wept in the presence of the LORD and fasted until evening. They also brought burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD.
07Jdg 20:27 The Israelites went up seeking direction from the LORD. (In those days the Ark of the Covenant of God was in Bethel,
07Jdg 20:28 and Phinehas son of Eleazar and grandson of Aaron was the priest.) The Israelites asked the LORD, "Should we fight against our relatives from Benjamin again, or should we stop?" The LORD said, "Go! Tomorrow I will hand them over to you."
07Jdg 20:29 So the Israelites set an ambush all around Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:30 They went out on the third day and took their positions at the same place as before.
07Jdg 20:31 When the men of Benjamin came out to attack, they were drawn away from the town. And as they had done before, they began to kill the Israelites. About thirty Israelites died in the open fields and along the roads, one leading to Bethel and the other leading back to Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:32 Then the warriors of Benjamin shouted, "We're defeating them as we did before!" But the Israelites had planned in advance to run away so that the men of Benjamin would chase them along the roads and be drawn away from the town.
07Jdg 20:33 When the main group of Israelite warriors reached Baal-tamar, they turned and took up their positions. Meanwhile, the Israelites hiding in ambush to the west¨ç of Gibeah jumped up to fight. / ¨ç{As in Greek and Syriac versions and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew reads hiding in the open space}
07Jdg 20:34 There were 10,000 elite Israelite troops who advanced against Gibeah. The fighting was so heavy that Benjamin didn't realize the impending disaster.
07Jdg 20:35 So the LORD helped Israel defeat Benjamin, and that day the Israelites killed 25,100 of Benjamin's warriors, all of whom were experienced swordsmen.
07Jdg 20:36 Then the men of Benjamin saw that they were beaten. The Israelites had retreated from Benjamin's warriors in order to give those hiding in ambush more room to maneuver against Gibeah.
07Jdg 20:37 Then those who were hiding rushed in from all sides and killed everyone in the town.
07Jdg 20:38 They had arranged to send up a large cloud of smoke from the town as a signal.
07Jdg 20:39 When the Israelites saw the smoke, they turned and attacked Benjamin's warriors. By that time Benjamin's warriors had killed about thirty Israelites, and they shouted, "We're defeating them as we did in the first battle!"
07Jdg 20:40 But when the warriors of Benjamin looked behind them and saw the smoke rising into the sky from every part of the town,
07Jdg 20:41 the men of Israel turned and attacked. At this point the men of Benjamin became terrified, because they realized disaster was close at hand.
07Jdg 20:42 So they turned around and fled before the Israelites toward the wilderness. But they couldn't escape the battle, and the people who came out of the nearby towns were also killed¨ç. / ¨ç{Or battle, for the people from the nearby towns also came out and killed them}
07Jdg 20:43 The Israelites surrounded the men of Benjamin and chased them relentlessly, finally overtaking them east of Gibeah¨ç. / ¨ç{The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
07Jdg 20:44 That day 18,000 of Benjamin's strongest warriors died in battle.
07Jdg 20:45 The survivors fled into the wilderness toward the rock of Rimmon, but Israel killed 5,000 of them along the road. They continued the chase until they had killed another 2,000 near Gidom.
07Jdg 20:46 So that day the tribe of Benjamin lost 25,000 strong warriors armed with swords,
07Jdg 20:47 leaving only 600 men who escaped to the rock of Rimmon, where they lived for four months.
07Jdg 20:48 And the Israelites returned and slaughtered every living thing in all the towns - the people, the livestock, and everything they found. They also burned down all the towns they came to.
07Jdg 21:1 The Israelites had vowed at Mizpah, "We will never give our daughters in marriage to a man from the tribe of Benjamin."
07Jdg 21:2 Now the people went to Bethel and sat in the presence of God until evening, weeping loudly and bitterly.
07Jdg 21:3 "O LORD, God of Israel," they cried out, "why has this happened in Israel? Now one of our tribes is missing from Israel!"
07Jdg 21:4 Early the next morning the people built an altar and presented their burnt offerings and peace offerings on it.
07Jdg 21:5 Then they said, "Who among the tribes of Israel did not join us at Mizpah when we held our assembly in the presence of the LORD?" At that time they had taken a solemn oath in the LORD's presence, vowing that anyone who refused to come would be put to death.
07Jdg 21:6 The Israelites felt sorry for their brother Benjamin and said, "Today one of the tribes of Israel has been cut off.
07Jdg 21:7 How can we find wives for the few who remain, since we have sworn by the LORD not to give them our daughters in marriage?"
07Jdg 21:8 So they asked, "Who among the tribes of Israel did not join us at Mizpah when we assembled in the presence of the LORD?" And they discovered that no one from Jabesh-gilead had attended the assembly.
07Jdg 21:9 For after they counted all the people, no one from Jabesh-gilead was present.
07Jdg 21:10 So the assembly sent 12,000 of their best warriors to Jabesh-gilead with orders to kill everyone there, including women and children.
07Jdg 21:11 "This is what you are to do," they said. "Completely destroy¨ç all the males and every woman who is not a virgin." / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering}
07Jdg 21:12 Among the residents of Jabesh-gilead they found 400 young virgins who had never slept with a man, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh in the land of Canaan.
07Jdg 21:13 The Israelite assembly sent a peace delegation to the remaining people of Benjamin who were living at the rock of Rimmon.
07Jdg 21:14 Then the men of Benjamin returned to their homes, and the 400 women of Jabesh-gilead who had been spared were given to them as wives. But there were not enough women for all of them.
07Jdg 21:15 The people felt sorry for Benjamin because the LORD had made this gap among the tribes of Israel.
07Jdg 21:16 So the elders of the assembly asked, "How can we find wives for the few who remain, since the women of the tribe of Benjamin are dead?
07Jdg 21:17 There must be heirs for the survivors so that an entire tribe of Israel is not wiped out.
07Jdg 21:18 But we cannot give them our own daughters in marriage because we have sworn with a solemn oath that anyone who does this will fall under God's curse."
07Jdg 21:19 Then they thought of the annual festival of the LORD held in Shiloh, south of Lebonah and north of Bethel, along the east side of the road that goes from Bethel to Shechem.
07Jdg 21:20 They told the men of Benjamin who still needed wives, "Go and hide in the vineyards.
07Jdg 21:21 When you see the young women of Shiloh come out for their dances, rush out from the vineyards, and each of you can take one of them home to the land of Benjamin to be your wife!
07Jdg 21:22 And when their fathers and brothers come to us in protest, we will tell them, 'Please be sympathetic. Let them have your daughters, for we didn't find wives for all of them when we destroyed Jabesh-gilead. And you are not guilty of breaking the vow since you did not actually give your daughters to them in marriage.'"
07Jdg 21:23 So the men of Benjamin did as they were told. Each man caught one of the women as she danced in the celebration and carried her off to be his wife. They returned to their own land, and they rebuilt their towns and lived in them.
07Jdg 21:24 Then the people of Israel departed by tribes and families, and they returned to their own homes.
07Jdg 21:25 In those days Israel had no king; all the people did whatever seemed right in their own eyes.
08
08Ru 1:1 In the days when the judges ruled in Israel, a severe famine came upon the land. So a man from Bethlehem in Judah left his home and went to live in the country of Moab, taking his wife and two sons with him.
08Ru 1:2 The man's name was Elimelech, and his wife was Naomi. Their two sons were Mahlon and Kilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in the land of Judah. And when they reached Moab, they settled there.
08Ru 1:3 Then Elimelech died, and Naomi was left with her two sons.
08Ru 1:4 The two sons married Moabite women. One married a woman named Orpah, and the other a woman named Ruth. But about ten years later,
08Ru 1:5 both Mahlon and Kilion died. This left Naomi alone, without her two sons or her husband.
08Ru 1:6 Then Naomi heard in Moab that the LORD had blessed his people in Judah by giving them good crops again. So Naomi and her daughters-in-law got ready to leave Moab to return to her homeland.
08Ru 1:7 With her two daughters-in-law she set out from the place where she had been living, and they took the road that would lead them back to Judah.
08Ru 1:8 But on the way, Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Go back to your mothers' homes. And may the LORD reward you for your kindness to your husbands and to me.
08Ru 1:9 May the LORD bless you with the security of another marriage." Then she kissed them good-bye, and they all broke down and wept.
08Ru 1:10 "No," they said. "We want to go with you to your people."
08Ru 1:11 But Naomi replied, "Why should you go on with me? Can I still give birth to other sons who could grow up to be your husbands?
08Ru 1:12 No, my daughters, return to your parents' homes, for I am too old to marry again. And even if it were possible, and I were to get married tonight and bear sons, then what?
08Ru 1:13 Would you wait for them to grow up and refuse to marry someone else? No, of course not, my daughters! Things are far more bitter for me than for you, because the LORD himself has raised his fist against me."
08Ru 1:14 And again they wept together, and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-bye. But Ruth clung tightly to Naomi.
08Ru 1:15 "Look," Naomi said to her, "your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods. You should do the same."
08Ru 1:16 But Ruth replied, "Don't ask me to leave you and turn back. Wherever you go, I will go; wherever you live, I will live. Your people will be my people, and your God will be my God.
08Ru 1:17 Wherever you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD punish me severely if I allow anything but death to separate us!"
08Ru 1:18 When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she said nothing more.
08Ru 1:19 So the two of them continued on their journey. When they came to Bethlehem, the entire town was excited by their arrival. "Is it really Naomi?" the women asked.
08Ru 1:20 "Don't call me Naomi," she responded. "Instead, call me Mara¨ç, for the Almighty has made life very bitter for me. / ¨ç{Naomi means "pleasant"; Mara means "bitter"}
08Ru 1:21 I went away full, but the LORD has brought me home empty. Why call me Naomi when the LORD has caused me to suffer¨ç and the Almighty has sent such tragedy upon me?" / ¨ç{Or has testified against me}
08Ru 1:22 So Naomi returned from Moab, accompanied by her daughter-in-law Ruth, the young Moabite woman. They arrived in Bethlehem in late spring, at the beginning of the barley harvest.
08Ru 2:1 Now there was a wealthy and influential man in Bethlehem named Boaz, who was a relative of Naomi's husband, Elimelech.
08Ru 2:2 One day Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, "Let me go out into the harvest fields to pick up the stalks of grain left behind by anyone who is kind enough to let me do it." Naomi replied, "All right, my daughter, go ahead."
08Ru 2:3 So Ruth went out to gather grain behind the harvesters. And as it happened, she found herself working in a field that belonged to Boaz, the relative of her father-in-law, Elimelech.
08Ru 2:4 While she was there, Boaz arrived from Bethlehem and greeted the harvesters. "The LORD be with you!" he said. "The LORD bless you!" the harvesters replied.
08Ru 2:5 Then Boaz asked his foreman, "Who is that young woman over there? Who does she belong to?"
08Ru 2:6 And the foreman replied, "She is the young woman from Moab who came back with Naomi.
08Ru 2:7 She asked me this morning if she could gather grain behind the harvesters. She has been hard at work ever since, except for a few minutes' rest in the shelter."
08Ru 2:8 Boaz went over and said to Ruth, "Listen, my daughter. Stay right here with us when you gather grain; don't go to any other fields. Stay right behind the young women working in my field.
08Ru 2:9 See which part of the field they are harvesting, and then follow them. I have warned the young men not to treat you roughly. And when you are thirsty, help yourself to the water they have drawn from the well."
08Ru 2:10 Ruth fell at his feet and thanked him warmly. "What have I done to deserve such kindness?" she asked. "I am only a foreigner."
08Ru 2:11 "Yes, I know," Boaz replied. "But I also know about everything you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband. I have heard how you left your father and mother and your own land to live here among complete strangers.
08Ru 2:12 May the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge, reward you fully for what you have done."
08Ru 2:13 "I hope I continue to please you, sir," she replied. "You have comforted me by speaking so kindly to me, even though I am not one of your workers."
08Ru 2:14 At mealtime Boaz called to her, "Come over here, and help yourself to some food. You can dip your bread in the sour wine." So she sat with his harvesters, and Boaz gave her some roasted grain to eat. She ate all she wanted and still had some left over.
08Ru 2:15 When Ruth went back to work again, Boaz ordered his young men, "Let her gather grain right among the sheaves without stopping her.
08Ru 2:16 And pull out some heads of barley from the bundles and drop them on purpose for her. Let her pick them up, and don't give her a hard time!"
08Ru 2:17 So Ruth gathered barley there all day, and when she beat out the grain that evening, it filled an entire basket¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew it was about an ephah [20 quarts or 22 liters]}
08Ru 2:18 She carried it back into town and showed it to her mother-in-law. Ruth also gave her the roasted grain that was left over from her meal.
08Ru 2:19 "Where did you gather all this grain today?" Naomi asked. "Where did you work? May the LORD bless the one who helped you!" So Ruth told her mother-in-law about the man in whose field she had worked. She said, "The man I worked with today is named Boaz."
08Ru 2:20 "May the LORD bless him!" Naomi told her daughter-in-law. "He is showing his kindness to us as well as to your dead husband¨ç. That man is one of our closest relatives, one of our family redeemers." / ¨ç{Hebrew to the living and to the dead}
08Ru 2:21 Then Ruth¨ç said, "What's more, Boaz even told me to come back and stay with his harvesters until the entire harvest is completed." / ¨ç{Hebrew Ruth the Moabite}
08Ru 2:22 "Good!" Naomi exclaimed. "Do as he said, my daughter. Stay with his young women right through the whole harvest. You might be harassed in other fields, but you'll be safe with him."
08Ru 2:23 So Ruth worked alongside the women in Boaz's fields and gathered grain with them until the end of the barley harvest. Then she continued working with them through the wheat harvest in early summer. And all the while she lived with her mother-in-law.
08Ru 3:1 One day Naomi said to Ruth, "My daughter, it's time that I found a permanent home for you, so that you will be provided for.
08Ru 3:2 Boaz is a close relative of ours, and he's been very kind by letting you gather grain with his young women. Tonight he will be winnowing barley at the threshing floor.
08Ru 3:3 Now do as I tell you?take a bath and put on perfume and dress in your nicest clothes. Then go to the threshing floor, but don't let Boaz see you until he has finished eating and drinking.
08Ru 3:4 Be sure to notice where he lies down; then go and uncover his feet and lie down there. He will tell you what to do."
08Ru 3:5 "I will do everything you say," Ruth replied.
08Ru 3:6 So she went down to the threshing floor that night and followed the instructions of her mother-in-law.
08Ru 3:7 After Boaz had finished eating and drinking and was in good spirits, he lay down at the far end of the pile of grain and went to sleep. Then Ruth came quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down.
08Ru 3:8 Around midnight Boaz suddenly woke up and turned over. He was surprised to find a woman lying at his feet!
08Ru 3:9 "Who are you?" he asked. "I am your servant Ruth," she replied. "Spread the corner of your covering over me, for you are my family redeemer."
08Ru 3:10 "The LORD bless you, my daughter!" Boaz exclaimed. "You are showing even more family loyalty now than you did before, for you have not gone after a younger man, whether rich or poor.
08Ru 3:11 Now don't worry about a thing, my daughter. I will do what is necessary, for everyone in town knows you are a virtuous woman.
08Ru 3:12 But while it's true that I am one of your family redeemers, there is another man who is more closely related to you than I am.
08Ru 3:13 Stay here tonight, and in the morning I will talk to him. If he is willing to redeem you, very well. Let him marry you. But if he is not willing, then as surely as the LORD lives, I will redeem you myself! Now lie down here until morning."
08Ru 3:14 So Ruth lay at Boaz's feet until the morning, but she got up before it was light enough for people to recognize each other. For Boaz had said, "No one must know that a woman was here at the threshing floor."
08Ru 3:15 Then Boaz said to her, "Bring your cloak and spread it out." He measured six scoops¨ç of barley into the cloak and placed it on her back. Then he¨è returned to the town. / ¨ç{Hebrew six measures, an unknown quantity} ¨è{Most Hebrew manuscripts read he; many Hebrew manuscripts, Syriac version, and Latin Vulgate read she}
08Ru 3:16 When Ruth went back to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked, "What happened, my daughter?" Ruth told Naomi everything Boaz had done for her,
08Ru 3:17 and she added, "He gave me these six scoops of barley and said, 'Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"
08Ru 3:18 Then Naomi said to her, "Just be patient, my daughter, until we hear what happens. The man won't rest until he has settled things today."
08Ru 4:1 Boaz went to the town gate and took a seat there. Just then the family redeemer he had mentioned came by, so Boaz called out to him, "Come over here and sit down, friend. I want to talk to you." So they sat down together.
08Ru 4:2 Then Boaz called ten leaders from the town and asked them to sit as witnesses.
08Ru 4:3 And Boaz said to the family redeemer, "You know Naomi, who came back from Moab. She is selling the land that belonged to our relative Elimelech.
08Ru 4:4 I thought I should speak to you about it so that you can redeem it if you wish. If you want the land, then buy it here in the presence of these witnesses. But if you don't want it, let me know right away, because I am next in line to redeem it after you." The man replied, "All right, I'll redeem it."
08Ru 4:5 Then Boaz told him, "Of course, your purchase of the land from Naomi also requires that you marry Ruth, the Moabite widow. That way she can have children who will carry on her husband's name and keep the land in the family."
08Ru 4:6 "Then I can't redeem it," the family redeemer replied, "because this might endanger my own estate. You redeem the land; I cannot do it."
08Ru 4:7 Now in those days it was the custom in Israel for anyone transferring a right of purchase to remove his sandal and hand it to the other party. This publicly validated the transaction.
08Ru 4:8 So the other family redeemer drew off his sandal as he said to Boaz, "You buy the land."
08Ru 4:9 Then Boaz said to the elders and to the crowd standing around, "You are witnesses that today I have bought from Naomi all the property of Elimelech, Kilion, and Mahlon.
08Ru 4:10 And with the land I have acquired Ruth, the Moabite widow of Mahlon, to be my wife. This way she can have a son to carry on the family name of her dead husband and to inherit the family property here in his hometown. You are all witnesses today."
08Ru 4:11 Then the elders and all the people standing in the gate replied, "We are witnesses! May the LORD make this woman who is coming into your home like Rachel and Leah, from whom all the nation of Israel descended! May you prosper in Ephrathah and be famous in Bethlehem.
08Ru 4:12 And may the LORD give you descendants by this young woman who will be like those of our ancestor Perez, the son of Tamar and Judah."
08Ru 4:13 So Boaz took Ruth into his home, and she became his wife. When he slept with her, the LORD enabled her to become pregnant, and she gave birth to a son.
08Ru 4:14 Then the women of the town said to Naomi, "Praise the LORD, who has now provided a redeemer for your family! May this child be famous in Israel.
08Ru 4:15 May he restore your youth and care for you in your old age. For he is the son of your daughter-in-law who loves you and has been better to you than seven sons!"
08Ru 4:16 Naomi took the baby and cuddled him to her breast. And she cared for him as if he were her own.
08Ru 4:17 The neighbor women said, "Now at last Naomi has a son again!" And they named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse and the grandfather of David.
08Ru 4:18 This is the genealogical record of their ancestor Perez£º Perez was the father of Hezron.
08Ru 4:19 Hezron was the father of Ram. Ram was the father of Amminadab.
08Ru 4:20 Amminadab was the father of Nahshon. Nahshon was the father of Salmon¨ç. / ¨ç{As in some Greek manuscripts (see also 4:21); Hebrew reads Salma}
08Ru 4:21 Salmon was the father of Boaz. Boaz was the father of Obed.
08Ru 4:22 Obed was the father of Jesse.Jesse was the father of David.

091Sm 1:1 There was a man named Elkanah who lived in Ramah in the region of Zuph¨ç in the hill country of Ephraim. He was the son of Jeroham, son of Elihu, son of Tohu, son of Zuph, of Ephraim. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads in Ramathaim-zophim; compare 1.19}
091Sm 1:2 Elkanah had two wives, Hannah and Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah did not.
091Sm 1:3 Each year Elkanah would travel to Shiloh to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of Heaven's Armies at the Tabernacle. The priests of the LORD at that time were the two sons of Eli - Hophni and Phinehas.
091Sm 1:4 On the days Elkanah presented his sacrifice, he would give portions of the meat to Peninnah and each of her children.
091Sm 1:5 And though he loved Hannah, he would give her only one choice portion¨ç because the LORD had given her no children. / ¨ç{Or And because he loved Hannah, he would give her a choice portion. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
091Sm 1:6 So Peninnah would taunt Hannah and make fun of her because the LORD had kept her from having children.
091Sm 1:7 Year after year it was the same - Peninnah would taunt Hannah as they went to the Tabernacle¨ç. Each time, Hannah would be reduced to tears and would not even eat. / ¨ç{Hebrew the house of the LORD; also in 1.24}
091Sm 1:8 "Why are you crying, Hannah?" Elkanah would ask. "Why aren't you eating? Why be downhearted just because you have no children? You have me - isn't that better than having ten sons?"
091Sm 1:9 Once after a sacrificial meal at Shiloh, Hannah got up and went to pray. Eli the priest was sitting at his customary place beside the entrance of the Tabernacle¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Temple of the LORD}
091Sm 1:10 Hannah was in deep anguish, crying bitterly as she prayed to the LORD.
091Sm 1:11 And she made this vow£º "O LORD of Heaven's Armies, if you will look upon my sorrow and answer my prayer and give me a son, then I will give him back to you. He will be yours for his entire lifetime, and as a sign that he has been dedicated to the LORD, his hair will never be cut¨ç." / ¨ç{Some manuscripts add He will drink neither wine nor intoxicants}
091Sm 1:12 As she was praying to the LORD, Eli watched her.
091Sm 1:13 Seeing her lips moving but hearing no sound, he thought she had been drinking.
091Sm 1:14 "Must you come here drunk?" he demanded. "Throw away your wine!"
091Sm 1:15 "Oh no, sir!" she replied. "I haven't been drinking wine or anything stronger. But I am very discouraged, and I was pouring out my heart to the LORD.
091Sm 1:16 Don't think I am a wicked woman! For I have been praying out of great anguish and sorrow."
091Sm 1:17 "In that case," Eli said, "go in peace! May the God of Israel grant the request you have asked of him."
091Sm 1:18 "Oh, thank you, sir!" she exclaimed. Then she went back and began to eat again, and she was no longer sad.
091Sm 1:19 The entire family got up early the next morning and went to worship the LORD once more. Then they returned home to Ramah. When Elkanah slept with Hannah, the LORD remembered her plea,
091Sm 1:20 and in due time she gave birth to a son. She named him Samuel¨ç, for she said, "I asked the LORD for him." / ¨ç{Samuel sounds like the Hebrew term for "asked of God" or "heard by God"}
091Sm 1:21 The next year Elkanah and his family went on their annual trip to offer a sacrifice to the LORD.
091Sm 1:22 But Hannah did not go. She told her husband, "Wait until the boy is weaned. Then I will take him to the Tabernacle and leave him there with the LORD permanently¨ç." / ¨ç{Some manuscripts add I will offer him as a Nazirite for all time}
091Sm 1:23 "Whatever you think is best," Elkanah agreed. "Stay here for now, and may the LORD help you keep your promise." So she stayed home and nursed the boy until he was weaned.
091Sm 1:24 When the child was weaned, Hannah took him to the Tabernacle in Shiloh. They brought along a three-year-old bull¨ç for the sacrifice and a basket¨è of flour and some wine. / ¨ç{As in Dead Sea Scrolls, Greek and Syriac versions; Masoretic Text reads three bulls} ¨è{Hebrew and an ephah [20 quarts or 22 liters]}
091Sm 1:25 After sacrificing the bull, they brought the boy to Eli.
091Sm 1:26 "Sir, do you remember me?" Hannah asked. "I am the woman who stood here several years ago praying to the LORD.
091Sm 1:27 I asked the LORD to give me this boy, and he has granted my request.
091Sm 1:28 Now I am giving him to the LORD, and he will belong to the LORD his whole life." And they¨ç worshiped the LORD there. / ¨ç{Hebrew he}
091Sm 2:1 Then Hannah prayed£º "My heart rejoices in the LORD! The LORD has made me strong¨ç. Now I have an answer for my enemies; I rejoice because you rescued me. / ¨ç{Hebrew has exalted my horn}
091Sm 2:2 No one is holy like the LORD! There is no one besides you; there is no Rock like our God.
091Sm 2:3 "Stop acting so proud and haughty! Don't speak with such arrogance! For the LORD is a God who knows what you have done; he will judge your actions.
091Sm 2:4 The bow of the mighty is now broken, and those who stumbled are now strong.
091Sm 2:5 Those who were well fed are now starving, and those who were starving are now full. The childless woman now has seven children, and the woman with many children wastes away.
091Sm 2:6 The LORD gives both death and life; he brings some down to the grave¨ç but raises others up. / ¨ç{Hebrew to Sheol}
091Sm 2:7 The LORD makes some poor and others rich; he brings some down and lifts others up.
091Sm 2:8 He lifts the poor from the dust and the needy from the garbage dump. He sets them among princes, placing them in seats of honor. For all the earth is the LORD's, and he has set the world in order.
091Sm 2:9 "He will protect his faithful ones, but the wicked will disappear in darkness. No one will succeed by strength alone.
091Sm 2:10 Those who fight against the LORD will be shattered. He thunders against them from heaven; the LORD judges throughout the earth. He gives power to his king; he increases the strength¨ç of his anointed one." / ¨ç{Hebrew he exalts the horn}
091Sm 2:11 Then Elkanah returned home to Ramah without Samuel. And the boy served the LORD by assisting Eli the priest.
091Sm 2:12 Now the sons of Eli were scoundrels who had no respect for the LORD
091Sm 2:13 or for their duties as priests. Whenever anyone offered a sacrifice, Eli's sons would send over a servant with a three-pronged fork. While the meat of the sacrificed animal was still boiling,
091Sm 2:14 the servant would stick the fork into the pot and demand that whatever it brought up be given to Eli's sons. All the Israelites who came to worship at Shiloh were treated this way.
091Sm 2:15 Sometimes the servant would come even before the animal's fat had been burned on the altar. He would demand raw meat before it had been boiled so that it could be used for roasting.
091Sm 2:16 The man offering the sacrifice might reply, "Take as much as you want, but the fat must be burned first." Then the servant would demand, "No, give it to me now, or I'll take it by force."
091Sm 2:17 So the sin of these young men was very serious in the LORD's sight, for they treated the LORD's offerings with contempt.
091Sm 2:18 But Samuel, though he was only a boy, served the LORD. He wore a linen garment like that of a priest¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew He wore a linen ephod}
091Sm 2:19 Each year his mother made a small coat for him and brought it to him when she came with her husband for the sacrifice.
091Sm 2:20 Before they returned home, Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, "May the LORD give you other children to take the place of this one she gave to the LORD¨ç." / ¨ç{As in Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version; Masoretic Text reads this one he requested of the LORD}
091Sm 2:21 And the LORD gave Hannah three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, Samuel grew up in the presence of the LORD.
091Sm 2:22 Now Eli was very old, but he was aware of what his sons were doing to the people of Israel. He knew, for instance, that his sons were seducing the young women who assisted at the entrance of the Tabernacle¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew Tent of Meeting. Some manuscripts lack this entire sentence}
091Sm 2:23 Eli said to them, "I have been hearing reports from all the people about the wicked things you are doing. Why do you keep sinning?
091Sm 2:24 You must stop, my sons! The reports I hear among the LORD's people are not good.
091Sm 2:25 If someone sins against another person, God¨ç can mediate for the guilty party. But if someone sins against the LORD, who can intercede?" But Eli's sons wouldn't listen to their father, for the LORD was already planning to put them to death. / ¨ç{Or the judges}
091Sm 2:26 Meanwhile, the boy Samuel grew taller and grew in favor with the LORD and with the people.
091Sm 2:27 One day a man of God came to Eli and gave him this message from the LORD£º "I revealed myself¨ç to your ancestors when the people of Israel were slaves in Egypt. / ¨ç{As in Greek and Syriac versions; Hebrew reads Did I reveal myself}
091Sm 2:28 I chose your ancestor Aaron¨ç from among all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer sacrifices on my altar, to burn incense, and to wear the priestly vest¨è as he served me. And I assigned the sacrificial offerings to you priests. / ¨ç{Hebrew your father} ¨è{Hebrew an ephod}
091Sm 2:29 So why do you scorn my sacrifices and offerings? Why do you give your sons more honor than you give me - for you and they have become fat from the best offerings of my people Israel!
091Sm 2:30 "Therefore, the LORD, the God of Israel, says£º I promised that your branch of the tribe of Levi¨ç would always be my priests. But I will honor those who honor me, and I will despise those who think lightly of me. / ¨ç{Hebrew that your house and your father's house}
091Sm 2:31 The time is coming when I will put an end to your family, so it will no longer serve as my priests. All the members of your family will die before their time. None will reach old age.
091Sm 2:32 You will watch with envy as I pour out prosperity on the people of Israel. But no members of your family will ever live out their days.
091Sm 2:33 Those who survive will live in sadness and grief, and their children will die a violent death¨ç. / ¨ç{As in Dead Sea Scrolls, which read die by the sword; Masoretic Text reads die like mortals}
091Sm 2:34 And to prove that what I have said will come true, I will cause your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, to die on the same day!
091Sm 2:35 "Then I will raise up a faithful priest who will serve me and do what I desire. I will establish his family, and they will be priests to my anointed kings forever.
091Sm 2:36 Then all of your surviving family will bow before him, begging for money and food. 'Please,' they will say, 'give us jobs among the priests so we will have enough to eat.'"
091Sm 3:1 Meanwhile, the boy Samuel served the LORD by assisting Eli. Now in those days messages from the LORD were very rare, and visions were quite uncommon.
091Sm 3:2 One night Eli, who was almost blind by now, had gone to bed.
091Sm 3:3 The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was sleeping in the Tabernacle¨ç near the Ark of God. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Temple of the LORD}
091Sm 3:4 Suddenly the LORD called out, "Samuel!" "Yes?" Samuel replied. "What is it?"
091Sm 3:5 He got up and ran to Eli. "Here I am. Did you call me?" "I didn't call you," Eli replied. "Go back to bed." So he did.
091Sm 3:6 Then the LORD called out again, "Samuel!" Again Samuel got up and went to Eli. "Here I am. Did you call me?" "I didn't call you, my son," Eli said. "Go back to bed."
091Sm 3:7 Samuel did not yet know the LORD because he had never had a message from the LORD before.
091Sm 3:8 So the LORD called a third time, and once more Samuel got up and went to Eli. "Here I am. Did you call me?" Then Eli realized it was the LORD who was calling the boy.
091Sm 3:9 So he said to Samuel, "Go and lie down again, and if someone calls again, say, 'Speak, LORD, your servant is listening.'" So Samuel went back to bed.
091Sm 3:10 And the LORD came and called as before, "Samuel! Samuel!" And Samuel replied, "Speak, your servant is listening."
091Sm 3:11 Then the LORD said to Samuel, "I am about to do a shocking thing in Israel.
091Sm 3:12 I am going to carry out all my threats against Eli and his family, from beginning to end.
091Sm 3:13 I have warned him that judgment is coming upon his family forever, because his sons are blaspheming God¨ç and he hasn't disciplined them. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads his sons have made themselves contemptible}
091Sm 3:14 So I have vowed that the sins of Eli and his sons will never be forgiven by sacrifices or offerings."
091Sm 3:15 Samuel stayed in bed until morning, then got up and opened the doors of the Tabernacle¨ç as usual. He was afraid to tell Eli what the LORD had said to him. / ¨ç{Hebrew the house of the LORD}
091Sm 3:16 But Eli called out to him, "Samuel, my son." "Here I am," Samuel replied.
091Sm 3:17 "What did the LORD say to you? Tell me everything. And may God strike you and even kill you if you hide anything from me!"
091Sm 3:18 So Samuel told Eli everything; he didn't hold anything back. "It is the LORD's will," Eli replied. "Let him do what he thinks best."
091Sm 3:19 As Samuel grew up, the LORD was with him, and everything Samuel said proved to be reliable.
091Sm 3:20 And all Israel, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, knew that Samuel was confirmed as a prophet of the LORD.
091Sm 3:21 The LORD continued to appear at Shiloh and gave messages to Samuel there at the Tabernacle.
091Sm 4:1 And Samuel's words went out to all the people of Israel.
091Sm 4:2 The Philistines attacked and defeated the army of Israel, killing 4,000 men.
091Sm 4:3 After the battle was over, the troops retreated to their camp, and the elders of Israel asked, "Why did the LORD allow us to be defeated by the Philistines?" Then they said, "Let's bring the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD from Shiloh. If we carry it into battle with us, it¨ç will save us from our enemies." / ¨ç{Or he}
091Sm 4:4 So they sent men to Shiloh to bring the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD of Heaven's Armies, who is enthroned between the cherubim. Hophni and Phinehas, the sons of Eli, were also there with the Ark of the Covenant of God.
091Sm 4:5 When all the Israelites saw the Ark of the Covenant of the LORD coming into the camp, their shout of joy was so loud it made the ground shake!
091Sm 4:6 "What's going on?" the Philistines asked. "What's all the shouting about in the Hebrew camp?" When they were told it was because the Ark of the LORD had arrived,
091Sm 4:7 they panicked. "The gods have¨ç come into their camp!" they cried. "This is a disaster! We have never had to face anything like this before! / ¨ç{Or A god has}
091Sm 4:8 Help! Who can save us from these mighty gods of Israel? They are the same gods who destroyed the Egyptians with plagues when Israel was in the wilderness.
091Sm 4:9 Fight as never before, Philistines! If you don't, we will become the Hebrews' slaves just as they have been ours! Stand up like men and fight!"
091Sm 4:10 So the Philistines fought desperately, and Israel was defeated again. The slaughter was great; 30,000 Israelite soldiers died that day. The survivors turned and fled to their tents.
091Sm 4:11 The Ark of God was captured, and Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were killed.
091Sm 4:12 A man from the tribe of Benjamin ran from the battlefield and arrived at Shiloh later that same day. He had torn his clothes and put dust on his head to show his grief.
091Sm 4:13 Eli was waiting beside the road to hear the news of the battle, for his heart trembled for the safety of the Ark of God. When the messenger arrived and told what had happened, an outcry resounded throughout the town.
091Sm 4:14 "What is all the noise about?" Eli asked.The messenger rushed over to Eli,
091Sm 4:15 who was ninety-eight years old and blind.
091Sm 4:16 He said to Eli, "I have just come from the battlefield - I was there this very day." "What happened, my son?" Eli demanded.
091Sm 4:17 "Israel has been defeated by the Philistines," the messenger replied. "The people have been slaughtered, and your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, were also killed. And the Ark of God has been captured."
091Sm 4:18 When the messenger mentioned what had happened to the Ark of God, Eli fell backward from his seat beside the gate. He broke his neck and died, for he was old and overweight. He had been Israel's judge for forty years.
091Sm 4:19 Eli's daughter-in-law, the wife of Phinehas, was pregnant and near her time of delivery. When she heard that the Ark of God had been captured and that her father-in-law and husband were dead, she went into labor and gave birth.
091Sm 4:20 She died in childbirth, but before she passed away the midwives tried to encourage her. "Don't be afraid," they said. "You have a baby boy!" But she did not answer or pay attention to them.
091Sm 4:21 She named the child Ichabod (which means "Where is the glory?"), for she said, "Israel's glory is gone." She named him this because the Ark of God had been captured and because her father-in-law and husband were dead.
091Sm 4:22 Then she said, "The glory has departed from Israel, for the Ark of God has been captured." [1b] At that time Israel was at war with the Philistines. The Israelite army was camped near Ebenezer, and the Philistines were at Aphek.
091Sm 5:1 After the Philistines captured the Ark of God, they took it from the battleground at Ebenezer to the town of Ashdod.
091Sm 5:2 They carried the Ark of God into the temple of Dagon and placed it beside an idol of Dagon.
091Sm 5:3 But when the citizens of Ashdod went to see it the next morning, Dagon had fallen with his face to the ground in front of the Ark of the LORD! So they took Dagon and put him in his place again.
091Sm 5:4 But the next morning the same thing happened - Dagon had fallen face down before the Ark of the LORD again. This time his head and hands had broken off and were lying in the doorway. Only the trunk of his body was left intact.
091Sm 5:5 That is why to this day neither the priests of Dagon nor anyone who enters the temple of Dagon in Ashdod will step on its threshold.
091Sm 5:6 Then the LORD's heavy hand struck the people of Ashdod and the nearby villages with a plague of tumors¨ç. / ¨ç{Greek version and Latin Vulgate read tumors; and rats appeared in their land, and death and destruction were throughout the city}
091Sm 5:7 When the people realized what was happening, they cried out, "We can't keep the Ark of the God of Israel here any longer! He is against us! We will all be destroyed along with Dagon, our god."
091Sm 5:8 So they called together the rulers of the Philistine towns and asked, "What should we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?" The rulers discussed it and replied, "Move it to the town of Gath." So they moved the Ark of the God of Israel to Gath.
091Sm 5:9 But when the Ark arrived at Gath, the LORD's heavy hand fell on its men, young and old; he struck them with a plague of tumors, and there was a great panic.
091Sm 5:10 So they sent the Ark of God to the town of Ekron, but when the people of Ekron saw it coming they cried out, "They are bringing the Ark of the God of Israel here to kill us, too!"
091Sm 5:11 The people summoned the Philistine rulers again and begged them, "Please send the Ark of the God of Israel back to its own country, or it¨ç will kill us all." For the deadly plague from God had already begun, and great fear was sweeping across the town. / ¨ç{Or he}
091Sm 5:12 Those who didn't die were afflicted with tumors; and the cry from the town rose to heaven.
091Sm 6:1 The Ark of the LORD remained in Philistine territory seven months in all.
091Sm 6:2 Then the Philistines called in their priests and diviners and asked them, "What should we do about the Ark of the LORD? Tell us how to return it to its own country."
091Sm 6:3 "Send the Ark of the God of Israel back with a gift," they were told. "Send a guilt offering so the plague will stop. Then, if you are healed, you will know it was his hand that caused the plague."
091Sm 6:4 "What sort of guilt offering should we send?" they asked. And they were told, "Since the plague has struck both you and your five rulers, make five gold tumors and five gold rats, just like those that have ravaged your land.
091Sm 6:5 Make these things to show honor to the God of Israel. Perhaps then he will stop afflicting you, your gods, and your land.
091Sm 6:6 Don't be stubborn and rebellious as Pharaoh and the Egyptians were. By the time God was finished with them, they were eager to let Israel go.
091Sm 6:7 "Now build a new cart, and find two cows that have just given birth to calves. Make sure the cows have never been yoked to a cart. Hitch the cows to the cart, but shut their calves away from them in a pen.
091Sm 6:8 Put the Ark of the LORD on the cart, and beside it place a chest containing the gold rats and gold tumors you are sending as a guilt offering. Then let the cows go wherever they want.
091Sm 6:9 If they cross the border of our land and go to Beth-shemesh, we will know it was the LORD who brought this great disaster upon us. If they don't, we will know it was not his hand that caused the plague. It came simply by chance."
091Sm 6:10 So these instructions were carried out. Two cows were hitched to the cart, and their newborn calves were shut up in a pen.
091Sm 6:11 Then the Ark of the LORD and the chest containing the gold rats and gold tumors were placed on the cart.
091Sm 6:12 And sure enough, without veering off in other directions, the cows went straight along the road toward Beth-shemesh, lowing as they went. The Philistine rulers followed them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.
091Sm 6:13 The people of Beth-shemesh were harvesting wheat in the valley, and when they saw the Ark, they were overjoyed!
091Sm 6:14 The cart came into the field of a man named Joshua and stopped beside a large rock. So the people broke up the wood of the cart for a fire and killed the cows and sacrificed them to the LORD as a burnt offering.
091Sm 6:15 Several men of the tribe of Levi lifted the Ark of the LORD and the chest containing the gold rats and gold tumors from the cart and placed them on the large rock. Many sacrifices and burnt offerings were offered to the LORD that day by the people of Beth-shemesh.
091Sm 6:16 The five Philistine rulers watched all this and then returned to Ekron that same day.
091Sm 6:17 The five gold tumors sent by the Philistines as a guilt offering to the LORD were gifts from the rulers of Ashdod, Gaza, Ashkelon, Gath, and Ekron.
091Sm 6:18 The five gold rats represented the five Philistine towns and their surrounding villages, which were controlled by the five rulers. The large rock at Beth-shemesh, where they set the Ark of the LORD, still stands in the field of Joshua as a witness to what happened there.
091Sm 6:19 But the LORD killed seventy men¨ç from Beth-shemesh because they looked into the Ark of the LORD. And the people mourned greatly because of what the LORD had done. / ¨ç{As in a few Hebrew manuscripts; most Hebrew manuscripts read 70 men, 50,000 men. Perhaps the text should be understood to read the LORD killed 70 men and 50 oxen}
091Sm 6:20 "Who is able to stand in the presence of the LORD, this holy God?" they cried out. "Where can we send the Ark from here?"
091Sm 6:21 So they sent messengers to the people at Kiriath-jearim and told them, "The Philistines have returned the Ark of the LORD. Come here and get it!"
091Sm 7:1 So the men of Kiriath-jearim came to get the Ark of the LORD. They took it to the hillside home of Abinadab and ordained Eleazar, his son, to be in charge of it.
091Sm 7:2 The Ark remained in Kiriath-jearim for a long time - twenty years in all. During that time all Israel mourned because it seemed the LORD had abandoned them.
091Sm 7:3 Then Samuel said to all the people of Israel, "If you are really serious about wanting to return to the LORD, get rid of your foreign gods and your images of Ashtoreth. Determine to obey only the LORD; then he will rescue you from the Philistines."
091Sm 7:4 So the Israelites got rid of their images of Baal and Ashtoreth and worshiped only the LORD.
091Sm 7:5 Then Samuel told them, "Gather all of Israel to Mizpah, and I will pray to the LORD for you."
091Sm 7:6 So they gathered at Mizpah and, in a great ceremony, drew water from a well and poured it out before the LORD. They also went without food all day and confessed that they had sinned against the LORD. (It was at Mizpah that Samuel became Israel's judge.)
091Sm 7:7 When the Philistine rulers heard that Israel had gathered at Mizpah, they mobilized their army and advanced. The Israelites were badly frightened when they learned that the Philistines were approaching.
091Sm 7:8 "Don't stop pleading with the LORD our God to save us from the Philistines!" they begged Samuel.
091Sm 7:9 So Samuel took a young lamb and offered it to the LORD as a whole burnt offering. He pleaded with the LORD to help Israel, and the LORD answered him.
091Sm 7:10 Just as Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines arrived to attack Israel. But the LORD spoke with a mighty voice of thunder from heaven that day, and the Philistines were thrown into such confusion that the Israelites defeated them.
091Sm 7:11 The men of Israel chased them from Mizpah to a place below Beth-car, slaughtering them all along the way.
091Sm 7:12 Samuel then took a large stone and placed it between the towns of Mizpah and Jeshanah¨ç. He named it Ebenezer (which means "the stone of help"), for he said, "Up to this point the LORD has helped us!" / ¨ç{As in Greek and Syriac versions; Hebrew reads Shen}
091Sm 7:13 So the Philistines were subdued and didn't invade Israel again for some time. And throughout Samuel's lifetime, the LORD's powerful hand was raised against the Philistines.
091Sm 7:14 The Israelite villages near Ekron and Gath that the Philistines had captured were restored to Israel, along with the rest of the territory that the Philistines had taken. And there was peace between Israel and the Amorites in those days.
091Sm 7:15 Samuel continued as Israel's judge for the rest of his life.
091Sm 7:16 Each year he traveled around, setting up his court first at Bethel, then at Gilgal, and then at Mizpah. He judged the people of Israel at each of these places.
091Sm 7:17 Then he would return to his home at Ramah, and he would hear cases there, too. And Samuel built an altar to the LORD at Ramah.
091Sm 8:1 As Samuel grew old, he appointed his sons to be judges over Israel.
091Sm 8:2 Joel and Abijah, his oldest sons, held court in Beersheba.
091Sm 8:3 But they were not like their father, for they were greedy for money. They accepted bribes and perverted justice.
091Sm 8:4 Finally, all the elders of Israel met at Ramah to discuss the matter with Samuel.
091Sm 8:5 "Look," they told him, "you are now old, and your sons are not like you. Give us a king to judge us like all the other nations have."
091Sm 8:6 Samuel was displeased with their request and went to the LORD for guidance.
091Sm 8:7 "Do everything they say to you," the LORD replied, "for it is me they are rejecting, not you. They don't want me to be their king any longer.
091Sm 8:8 Ever since I brought them from Egypt they have continually abandoned me and followed other gods. And now they are giving you the same treatment.
091Sm 8:9 Do as they ask, but solemnly warn them about the way a king will reign over them."
091Sm 8:10 So Samuel passed on the LORD's warning to the people who were asking him for a king.
091Sm 8:11 "This is how a king will reign over you," Samuel said. "The king will draft your sons and assign them to his chariots and his charioteers, making them run before his chariots.
091Sm 8:12 Some will be generals and captains in his army¨ç, some will be forced to plow in his fields and harvest his crops, and some will make his weapons and chariot equipment. / ¨ç{Hebrew commanders of thousands and commanders of fifties}
091Sm 8:13 The king will take your daughters from you and force them to cook and bake and make perfumes for him.
091Sm 8:14 He will take away the best of your fields and vineyards and olive groves and give them to his own officials.
091Sm 8:15 He will take a tenth of your grain and your grape harvest and distribute it among his officers and attendants.
091Sm 8:16 He will take your male and female slaves and demand the finest of your cattle¨ç and donkeys for his own use. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads young men}
091Sm 8:17 He will demand a tenth of your flocks, and you will be his slaves.
091Sm 8:18 When that day comes, you will beg for relief from this king you are demanding, but then the LORD will not help you."
091Sm 8:19 But the people refused to listen to Samuel's warning. "Even so, we still want a king," they said.
091Sm 8:20 "We want to be like the nations around us. Our king will judge us and lead us into battle."
091Sm 8:21 So Samuel repeated to the LORD what the people had said,
091Sm 8:22 and the LORD replied, "Do as they say, and give them a king." Then Samuel agreed and sent the people home.
091Sm 9:1 There was a wealthy, influential man named Kish from the tribe of Benjamin. He was the son of Abiel, son of Zeror, son of Becorath, son of Aphiah, of the tribe of Benjamin.
091Sm 9:2 His son Saul was the most handsome man in Israel - head and shoulders taller than anyone else in the land.
091Sm 9:3 One day Kish's donkeys strayed away, and he told Saul, "Take a servant with you, and go look for the donkeys."
091Sm 9:4 So Saul took one of the servants and traveled through the hill country of Ephraim, the land of Shalishah, the Shaalim area, and the entire land of Benjamin, but they couldn't find the donkeys anywhere.
091Sm 9:5 Finally, they entered the region of Zuph, and Saul said to his servant, "Let's go home. By now my father will be more worried about us than about the donkeys!"
091Sm 9:6 But the servant said, "I've just thought of something! There is a man of God who lives here in this town. He is held in high honor by all the people because everything he says comes true. Let's go find him. Perhaps he can tell us which way to go."
091Sm 9:7 "But we don't have anything to offer him," Saul replied. "Even our food is gone, and we don't have a thing to give him."
091Sm 9:8 "Well," the servant said, "I have one small silver piece¨ç. We can at least offer it to the man of God and see what happens!" / ¨ç{Hebrew 1/4 shekel of silver, about 0.1 ounces or 3 grams in weight}
091Sm 9:9 (In those days if people wanted a message from God, they would say, "Let's go and ask the seer," for prophets used to be called seers.)
091Sm 9:10 "All right," Saul agreed, "let's try it!" So they started into the town where the man of God lived.
091Sm 9:11 As they were climbing the hill to the town, they met some young women coming out to draw water. So Saul and his servant asked, "Is the seer here today?"
091Sm 9:12 "Yes," they replied. "Stay right on this road. He is at the town gates. He has just arrived to take part in a public sacrifice up at the place of worship.
091Sm 9:13 Hurry and catch him before he goes up there to eat. The guests won't begin eating until he arrives to bless the food."
091Sm 9:14 So they entered the town, and as they passed through the gates, Samuel was coming out toward them to go up to the place of worship.
091Sm 9:15 Now the LORD had told Samuel the previous day,
091Sm 9:16 "About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin. Anoint him to be the leader of my people, Israel. He will rescue them from the Philistines, for I have looked down on my people in mercy and have heard their cry."
091Sm 9:17 When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said, "That's the man I told you about! He will rule my people."
091Sm 9:18 Just then Saul approached Samuel at the gateway and asked, "Can you please tell me where the seer's house is?"
091Sm 9:19 "I am the seer!" Samuel replied. "Go up to the place of worship ahead of me. We will eat there together, and in the morning I'll tell you what you want to know and send you on your way.
091Sm 9:20 And don't worry about those donkeys that were lost three days ago, for they have been found. And I am here to tell you that you and your family are the focus of all Israel's hopes."
091Sm 9:21 Saul replied, "But I'm only from the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe in Israel, and my family is the least important of all the families of that tribe! Why are you talking like this to me?"
091Sm 9:22 Then Samuel brought Saul and his servant into the hall and placed them at the head of the table, honoring them above the thirty special guests.
091Sm 9:23 Samuel then instructed the cook to bring Saul the finest cut of meat, the piece that had been set aside for the guest of honor.
091Sm 9:24 So the cook brought in the meat and placed it before Saul. "Go ahead and eat it," Samuel said. "I was saving it for you even before I invited these others!" So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
091Sm 9:25 When they came down from the place of worship and returned to town, Samuel took Saul up to the roof of the house and prepared a bed for him there¨ç. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads and talked with him there}
091Sm 9:26 At daybreak the next morning, Samuel called to Saul, "Get up! It's time you were on your way." So Saul got ready, and he and Samuel left the house together.
091Sm 9:27 When they reached the edge of town, Samuel told Saul to send his servant on ahead. After the servant was gone, Samuel said, "Stay here, for I have received a special message for you from God."
091Sm 10:1 Then Samuel took a flask of olive oil and poured it over Saul's head. He kissed Saul and said, "I am doing this because the LORD has appointed you to be the ruler over Israel, his special possession¨ç. / ¨ç{Greek version reads over Israel. And you will rule over the LORD's people and save them from their enemies around them. This will be the sign to you that the LORD has appointed you to be leader over his special possession}
091Sm 10:2 When you leave me today, you will see two men beside Rachel's tomb at Zelzah, on the border of Benjamin. They will tell you that the donkeys have been found and that your father has stopped worrying about them and is now worried about you. He is asking, 'Have you seen my son?'
091Sm 10:3 "When you get to the oak of Tabor, you will see three men coming toward you who are on their way to worship God at Bethel. One will be bringing three young goats, another will have three loaves of bread, and the third will be carrying a wineskin full of wine.
091Sm 10:4 They will greet you and offer you two of the loaves, which you are to accept.
091Sm 10:5 "When you arrive at Gibeah of God¨ç, where the garrison of the Philistines is located, you will meet a band of prophets coming down from the place of worship. They will be playing a harp, a tambourine, a flute, and a lyre, and they will be prophesying. / ¨ç{Hebrew Gibeath-elohim}
091Sm 10:6 At that time the Spirit of the LORD will come powerfully upon you, and you will prophesy with them. You will be changed into a different person.
091Sm 10:7 After these signs take place, do what must be done, for God is with you.
091Sm 10:8 Then go down to Gilgal ahead of me. I will join you there to sacrifice burnt offerings and peace offerings. You must wait for seven days until I arrive and give you further instructions."
091Sm 10:9 As Saul turned and started to leave, God gave him a new heart, and all Samuel's signs were fulfilled that day.
091Sm 10:10 When Saul and his servant arrived at Gibeah, they saw a group of prophets coming toward them. Then the Spirit of God came powerfully upon Saul, and he, too, began to prophesy.
091Sm 10:11 When those who knew Saul heard about it, they exclaimed, "What? Is even Saul a prophet? How did the son of Kish become a prophet?"
091Sm 10:12 And one of those standing there said, "Can anyone become a prophet, no matter who his father is?"¨ç So that is the origin of the saying "Is even Saul a prophet?" / ¨ç{Hebrew said, "Who is their father?"}
091Sm 10:13 When Saul had finished prophesying, he went up to the place of worship.
091Sm 10:14 "Where have you been?" Saul's uncle asked him and his servant. "We were looking for the donkeys," Saul replied, "but we couldn't find them. So we went to Samuel to ask him where they were."
091Sm 10:15 "Oh? And what did he say?" his uncle asked.
091Sm 10:16 "He told us that the donkeys had already been found," Saul replied. But Saul didn't tell his uncle what Samuel said about the kingdom.
091Sm 10:17 Later Samuel called all the people of Israel to meet before the LORD at Mizpah.
091Sm 10:18 And he said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, has declared£º I brought you from Egypt and rescued you from the Egyptians and from all of the nations that were oppressing you.
091Sm 10:19 But though I have rescued you from your misery and distress, you have rejected your God today and have said, 'No, we want a king instead!' Now, therefore, present yourselves before the LORD by tribes and clans."
091Sm 10:20 So Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel before the LORD, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen by lot.
091Sm 10:21 Then he brought each family of the tribe of Benjamin before the LORD, and the family of the Matrites was chosen. And finally Saul son of Kish was chosen from among them. But when they looked for him, he had disappeared!
091Sm 10:22 So they asked the LORD, "Where is he?" And the LORD replied, "He is hiding among the baggage."
091Sm 10:23 So they found him and brought him out, and he stood head and shoulders above anyone else.
091Sm 10:24 Then Samuel said to all the people, "This is the man the LORD has chosen as your king. No one in all Israel is like him!" And all the people shouted, "Long live the king!"
091Sm 10:25 Then Samuel told the people what the rights and duties of a king were. He wrote them down on a scroll and placed it before the LORD. Then Samuel sent the people home again.
091Sm 10:26 When Saul returned to his home at Gibeah, a group of men whose hearts God had touched went with him.
091Sm 10:27 But there were some scoundrels who complained, "How can this man save us?" And they scorned him and refused to bring him gifts. But Saul ignored them.[Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been grievously oppressing the people of Gad and Reuben who lived east of the Jordan River. He gouged out the right eye of each of the Israelites living there, and he didn't allow anyone to come and rescue them. In fact, of all the Israelites east of the Jordan, there wasn't a single one whose right eye Nahash had not gouged out. But there were 7,000 men who had escaped from the Ammonites, and they had settled in Jabesh-gilead.]¨ç / ¨ç{This paragraph, which is not included in the Masoretic Text, is found in Dead Sea Scroll 4QSama}
091Sm 11:1 About a month later¨ç, King Nahash of Ammon led his army against the Israelite town of Jabesh-gilead. But all the citizens of Jabesh asked for peace. "Make a treaty with us, and we will be your servants," they pleaded. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew lacks About a month later}
091Sm 11:2 "All right," Nahash said, "but only on one condition. I will gouge out the right eye of every one of you as a disgrace to all Israel!"
091Sm 11:3 "Give us seven days to send messengers throughout Israel!" replied the elders of Jabesh. "If no one comes to save us, we will agree to your terms."
091Sm 11:4 When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told the people about their plight, everyone broke into tears.
091Sm 11:5 Saul had been plowing a field with his oxen, and when he returned to town, he asked, "What's the matter? Why is everyone crying?" So they told him about the message from Jabesh.
091Sm 11:6 Then the Spirit of God came powerfully upon Saul, and he became very angry.
091Sm 11:7 He took two oxen and cut them into pieces and sent the messengers to carry them throughout Israel with this message£º "This is what will happen to the oxen of anyone who refuses to follow Saul and Samuel into battle!" And the LORD made the people afraid of Saul's anger, and all of them came out together as one.
091Sm 11:8 When Saul mobilized them at Bezek, he found that there were 300,000 men from Israel and 30,000¨ç men from Judah. / ¨ç{Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version read 70,000}
091Sm 11:9 So Saul sent the messengers back to Jabesh-gilead to say, "We will rescue you by noontime tomorrow!" There was great joy throughout the town when that message arrived!
091Sm 11:10 The men of Jabesh then told their enemies, "Tomorrow we will come out to you, and you can do to us whatever you wish."
091Sm 11:11 But before dawn the next morning, Saul arrived, having divided his army into three detachments. He launched a surprise attack against the Ammonites and slaughtered them the whole morning. The remnant of their army was so badly scattered that no two of them were left together.
091Sm 11:12 Then the people exclaimed to Samuel, "Now where are those men who said, 'Why should Saul rule over us?' Bring them here, and we will kill them!"
091Sm 11:13 But Saul replied, "No one will be executed today, for today the LORD has rescued Israel!"
091Sm 11:14 Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, let us all go to Gilgal to renew the kingdom."
091Sm 11:15 So they all went to Gilgal, and in a solemn ceremony before the LORD they made Saul king. Then they offered peace offerings to the LORD, and Saul and all the Israelites were filled with joy.
091Sm 12:1 Then Samuel addressed all Israel£º "I have done as you asked and given you a king.
091Sm 12:2 Your king is now your leader. I stand here before you - an old, gray-haired man - and my sons serve you. I have served as your leader from the time I was a boy to this very day.
091Sm 12:3 Now testify against me in the presence of the LORD and before his anointed one. Whose ox or donkey have I stolen? Have I ever cheated any of you? Have I ever oppressed you? Have I ever taken a bribe and perverted justice? Tell me and I will make right whatever I have done wrong."
091Sm 12:4 "No," they replied, "you have never cheated or oppressed us, and you have never taken even a single bribe."
091Sm 12:5 "The LORD and his anointed one are my witnesses today," Samuel declared, "that my hands are clean." "Yes, he is a witness," they replied.
091Sm 12:6 "It was the LORD who appointed Moses and Aaron," Samuel continued. "He brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt.
091Sm 12:7 Now stand here quietly before the LORD as I remind you of all the great things the LORD has done for you and your ancestors.
091Sm 12:8 "When the Israelites were¨ç in Egypt and cried out to the LORD, he sent Moses and Aaron to rescue them from Egypt and to bring them into this land. / ¨ç{Hebrew When Jacob was. The names "Jacob" and "Israel" are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation}
091Sm 12:9 But the people soon forgot about the LORD their God, so he handed them over to Sisera, the commander of Hazor's army, and also to the Philistines and to the king of Moab, who fought against them.
091Sm 12:10 "Then they cried to the LORD again and confessed, 'We have sinned by turning away from the LORD and worshiping the images of Baal and Ashtoreth. But we will worship you and you alone if you will rescue us from our enemies.'
091Sm 12:11 Then the LORD sent Gideon¨ç, Bedan¨è, Jephthah, and Samuel¨é to save you, and you lived in safety. / ¨ç{Hebrew Jerub-baal, another name for Gideon; see Judg 6.32} ¨è{Greek and Syriac versions read Barak} ¨é{Greek and Syriac versions read Samson}
091Sm 12:12 "But when you were afraid of Nahash, the king of Ammon, you came to me and said that you wanted a king to reign over you, even though the LORD your God was already your king.
091Sm 12:13 All right, here is the king you have chosen. You asked for him, and the LORD has granted your request.
091Sm 12:14 "Now if you fear and worship the LORD and listen to his voice, and if you do not rebel against the LORD's commands, then both you and your king will show that you recognize the LORD as your God.
091Sm 12:15 But if you rebel against the LORD's commands and refuse to listen to him, then his hand will be as heavy upon you as it was upon your ancestors.
091Sm 12:16 "Now stand here and see the great thing the LORD is about to do.
091Sm 12:17 You know that it does not rain at this time of the year during the wheat harvest. I will ask the LORD to send thunder and rain today. Then you will realize how wicked you have been in asking the LORD for a king!"
091Sm 12:18 So Samuel called to the LORD, and the LORD sent thunder and rain that day. And all the people were terrified of the LORD and of Samuel.
091Sm 12:19 "Pray to the LORD your God for us, or we will die!" they all said to Samuel. "For now we have added to our sins by asking for a king."
091Sm 12:20 "Don't be afraid," Samuel reassured them. "You have certainly done wrong, but make sure now that you worship the LORD with all your heart, and don't turn your back on him.
091Sm 12:21 Don't go back to worshiping worthless idols that cannot help or rescue you - they are totally useless!
091Sm 12:22 The LORD will not abandon his people, because that would dishonor his great name. For it has pleased the LORD to make you his very own people.
091Sm 12:23 "As for me, I will certainly not sin against the LORD by ending my prayers for you. And I will continue to teach you what is good and right.
091Sm 12:24 But be sure to fear the LORD and faithfully serve him. Think of all the wonderful things he has done for you.
091Sm 12:25 But if you continue to sin, you and your king will be swept away."
091Sm 13:1 Saul was thirty¨ç years old when he became king, and he reigned for forty-two years¨è. / ¨ç{As in a few Greek manuscripts; the number is missing in the Hebrew} ¨è{Hebrew reigned . . . and two; the number is incomplete in the Hebrew. Compare Acts 13.21}
091Sm 13:2 Saul selected 3,000 special troops from the army of Israel and sent the rest of the men home. He took 2,000 of the chosen men with him to Micmash and the hill country of Bethel. The other 1,000 went with Saul's son Jonathan to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin.
091Sm 13:3 Soon after this, Jonathan attacked and defeated the garrison of Philistines at Geba. The news spread quickly among the Philistines. So Saul blew the ram's horn throughout the land, saying, "Hebrews, hear this! Rise up in revolt!"
091Sm 13:4 All Israel heard the news that Saul had destroyed the Philistine garrison at Geba and that the Philistines now hated the Israelites more than ever. So the entire Israelite army was summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.
091Sm 13:5 The Philistines mustered a mighty army of 3,000¨ç chariots, 6,000 charioteers, and as many warriors as the grains of sand on the seashore! They camped at Micmash east of Beth-aven. / ¨ç{As in Greek and Syriac versions; Hebrew reads 30,000}
091Sm 13:6 The men of Israel saw what a tight spot they were in; and because they were hard pressed by the enemy, they tried to hide in caves, thickets, rocks, holes, and cisterns.
091Sm 13:7 Some of them crossed the Jordan River and escaped into the land of Gad and Gilead. Meanwhile, Saul stayed at Gilgal, and his men were trembling with fear.
091Sm 13:8 Saul waited there seven days for Samuel, as Samuel had instructed him earlier, but Samuel still didn't come. Saul realized that his troops were rapidly slipping away.
091Sm 13:9 So he demanded, "Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings!" And Saul sacrificed the burnt offering himself.
091Sm 13:10 Just as Saul was finishing with the burnt offering, Samuel arrived. Saul went out to meet and welcome him,
091Sm 13:11 but Samuel said, "What is this you have done?" Saul replied, "I saw my men scattering from me, and you didn't arrive when you said you would, and the Philistines are at Micmash ready for battle.
091Sm 13:12 So I said, 'The Philistines are ready to march against us at Gilgal, and I haven't even asked for the LORD's help!' So I felt compelled to offer the burnt offering myself before you came."
091Sm 13:13 "How foolish!" Samuel exclaimed. "You have not kept the command the LORD your God gave you. Had you kept it, the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever.
091Sm 13:14 But now your kingdom must end, for the LORD has sought out a man after his own heart. The LORD has already appointed him to be the leader of his people, because you have not kept the LORD's command."
091Sm 13:15 Samuel then left Gilgal and went on his way, but the rest of the troops went with Saul to meet the army. They went up from Gilgal to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin¨ç. When Saul counted the men who were still with him, he found only 600 were left! / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads Samuel then left Gilgal and went to Gibeah in the land of Benjamin}
091Sm 13:16 Saul and Jonathan and the troops with them were staying at Geba in the land of Benjamin. The Philistines set up their camp at Micmash.
091Sm 13:17 Three raiding parties soon left the camp of the Philistines. One went north toward Ophrah in the land of Shual,
091Sm 13:18 another went west to Beth-horon, and the third moved toward the border above the valley of Zeboim near the wilderness.
091Sm 13:19 There were no blacksmiths in the land of Israel in those days. The Philistines wouldn't allow them for fear they would make swords and spears for the Hebrews.
091Sm 13:20 So whenever the Israelites needed to sharpen their plowshares, picks, axes, or sickles¨ç, they had to take them to a Philistine blacksmith. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads or plowshares}
091Sm 13:21 (The charges were as follows£º a quarter of an ounce of silver¨ç for sharpening a plowshare or a pick, and an eighth of an ounce¨è for sharpening an ax, a sickle, or an ox goad.) / ¨ç{Hebrew 1 pim [8 grams]} ¨è{Hebrew | of a shekel [4 grams]}
091Sm 13:22 So on the day of the battle none of the people of Israel had a sword or spear, except for Saul and Jonathan.
091Sm 13:23 The pass at Micmash had meanwhile been secured by a contingent of the Philistine army.
091Sm 14:1 One day Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "Come on, let's go over to where the Philistines have their outpost." But Jonathan did not tell his father what he was doing.
091Sm 14:2 Meanwhile, Saul and his 600 men were camped on the outskirts of Gibeah, around the pomegranate tree¨ç at Migron. / ¨ç{Or around the rock of Rimmon; compare Judg 20.45, 47; 21.13}
091Sm 14:3 Among Saul's men was Ahijah the priest, who was wearing the ephod, the priestly vest. Ahijah was the son of Ichabod's brother Ahitub, son of Phinehas, son of Eli, the priest of the LORD who had served at Shiloh. No one realized that Jonathan had left the Israelite camp.
091Sm 14:4 To reach the Philistine outpost, Jonathan had to go down between two rocky cliffs that were called Bozez and Seneh.
091Sm 14:5 The cliff on the north was in front of Micmash, and the one on the south was in front of Geba.
091Sm 14:6 "Let's go across to the outpost of those pagans," Jonathan said to his armor bearer. "Perhaps the LORD will help us, for nothing can hinder the LORD. He can win a battle whether he has many warriors or only a few!"
091Sm 14:7 "Do what you think is best," the armor bearer replied. "I'm with you completely, whatever you decide."
091Sm 14:8 "All right then," Jonathan told him. "We will cross over and let them see us.
091Sm 14:9 If they say to us, 'Stay where you are or we'll kill you,' then we will stop and not go up to them.
091Sm 14:10 But if they say, 'Come on up and fight,' then we will go up. That will be the LORD's sign that he will help us defeat them."
091Sm 14:11 When the Philistines saw them coming, they shouted, "Look! The Hebrews are crawling out of their holes!"
091Sm 14:12 Then the men from the outpost shouted to Jonathan, "Come on up here, and we'll teach you a lesson!" "Come on, climb right behind me," Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "for the LORD will help us defeat them!"
091Sm 14:13 So they climbed up using both hands and feet, and the Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer killed those who came behind them.
091Sm 14:14 They killed some twenty men in all, and their bodies were scattered over about half an acre¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew half a yoke; a "yoke" was the amount of land plowed by a pair of yoked oxen in one day}
091Sm 14:15 Suddenly, panic broke out in the Philistine army, both in the camp and in the field, including even the outposts and raiding parties. And just then an earthquake struck, and everyone was terrified.
091Sm 14:16 Saul's lookouts in Gibeah of Benjamin saw a strange sight - the vast army of Philistines began to melt away in every direction.
091Sm 14:17 "Call the roll and find out who's missing," Saul ordered. And when they checked, they found that Jonathan and his armor bearer were gone.
091Sm 14:18 Then Saul shouted to Ahijah, "Bring the ephod here!" For at that time Ahijah was wearing the ephod in front of the Israelites¨ç. / ¨ç{As in some Greek manuscripts; Hebrew reads "Bring the Ark of God." For at that time the Ark of God was with the Israelites}
091Sm 14:19 But while Saul was talking to the priest, the confusion in the Philistine camp grew louder and louder. So Saul said to the priest, "Never mind; let's get going!"¨ç / ¨ç{Hebrew Withdraw your hand}
091Sm 14:20 Then Saul and all his men rushed out to the battle and found the Philistines killing each other. There was terrible confusion everywhere.
091Sm 14:21 Even the Hebrews who had previously gone over to the Philistine army revolted and joined in with Saul, Jonathan, and the rest of the Israelites.
091Sm 14:22 Likewise, the men of Israel who were hiding in the hill country of Ephraim joined the chase when they saw the Philistines running away.
091Sm 14:23 So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the battle continued to rage even beyond Beth-aven.
091Sm 14:24 Now the men of Israel were pressed to exhaustion that day, because Saul had placed them under an oath, saying, "Let a curse fall on anyone who eats before evening - before I have full revenge on my enemies." So no one ate anything all day,
091Sm 14:25 even though they had all found honeycomb on the ground in the forest.
091Sm 14:26 They didn't dare touch the honey because they all feared the oath they had taken.
091Sm 14:27 But Jonathan had not heard his father's command, and he dipped the end of his stick into a piece of honeycomb and ate the honey. After he had eaten it, he felt refreshed¨ç. / ¨ç{Or his eyes brightened; similarly in 14.29}
091Sm 14:28 But one of the men saw him and said, "Your father made the army take a strict oath that anyone who eats food today will be cursed. That is why everyone is weary and faint."
091Sm 14:29 "My father has made trouble for us all!" Jonathan exclaimed. "A command like that only hurts us. See how refreshed I am now that I have eaten this little bit of honey.
091Sm 14:30 If the men had been allowed to eat freely from the food they found among our enemies, think how many more Philistines we could have killed!"
091Sm 14:31 They chased and killed the Philistines all day from Micmash to Aijalon, growing more and more faint.
091Sm 14:32 That evening they rushed for the battle plunder and butchered the sheep, goats, cattle, and calves, but they ate them without draining the blood.
091Sm 14:33 Someone reported to Saul, "Look, the men are sinning against the LORD by eating meat that still has blood in it." "That is very wrong," Saul said. "Find a large stone and roll it over here.
091Sm 14:34 Then go out among the troops and tell them, 'Bring the cattle, sheep, and goats here to me. Kill them here, and drain the blood before you eat them. Do not sin against the LORD by eating meat with the blood still in it.'" So that night all the troops brought their animals and slaughtered them there.
091Sm 14:35 Then Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first of the altars he built to the LORD.
091Sm 14:36 Then Saul said, "Let's chase the Philistines all night and plunder them until sunrise. Let's destroy every last one of them." His men replied, "We'll do whatever you think is best." But the priest said, "Let's ask God first."
091Sm 14:37 So Saul asked God, "Should we go after the Philistines? Will you help us defeat them?" But God made no reply that day.
091Sm 14:38 Then Saul said to the leaders, "Something's wrong! I want all my army commanders to come here. We must find out what sin was committed today.
091Sm 14:39 I vow by the name of the LORD who rescued Israel that the sinner will surely die, even if it is my own son Jonathan!" But no one would tell him what the trouble was.
091Sm 14:40 Then Saul said, "Jonathan and I will stand over here, and all of you stand over there." And the people responded to Saul, "Whatever you think is best."
091Sm 14:41 Then Saul prayed, "O LORD, God of Israel, please show us who is guilty and who is innocent¨ç." Then they cast sacred lots, and Jonathan and Saul were chosen as the guilty ones, and the people were declared innocent. / ¨ç{Greek version adds If the fault is with me or my son Jonathan, respond with Urim; but if the men of Israel are at fault, respond with Thummim}
091Sm 14:42 Then Saul said, "Now cast lots again and choose between me and Jonathan." And Jonathan was shown to be the guilty one.
091Sm 14:43 "Tell me what you have done," Saul demanded of Jonathan. "I tasted a little honey," Jonathan admitted. "It was only a little bit on the end of my stick. Does that deserve death?"
091Sm 14:44 "Yes, Jonathan," Saul said, "you must die! May God strike me and even kill me if you do not die for this."
091Sm 14:45 But the people broke in and said to Saul, "Jonathan has won this great victory for Israel. Should he die? Far from it! As surely as the LORD lives, not one hair on his head will be touched, for God helped him do a great deed today." So the people rescued Jonathan, and he was not put to death.
091Sm 14:46 Then Saul called back the army from chasing the Philistines, and the Philistines returned home.
091Sm 14:47 Now when Saul had secured his grasp on Israel's throne, he fought against his enemies in every direction - against Moab, Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. And wherever he turned, he was victorious¨ç. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads he acted wickedly}
091Sm 14:48 He performed great deeds and conquered the Amalekites, saving Israel from all those who had plundered them.
091Sm 14:49 Saul's sons included Jonathan, Ishbosheth¨ç, and Malkishua. He also had two daughters£º Merab, who was older, and Michal. / ¨ç{Hebrew Ishvi, a variant name for Ishbosheth; also known as Esh-baal}
091Sm 14:50 Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of Ahimaaz. The commander of Saul's army was Abner, the son of Saul's uncle Ner.
091Sm 14:51 Saul's father, Kish, and Abner's father, Ner, were both sons of Abiel.
091Sm 14:52 The Israelites fought constantly with the Philistines throughout Saul's lifetime. So whenever Saul observed a young man who was brave and strong, he drafted him into his army.
091Sm 15:1 One day Samuel said to Saul, "It was the LORD who told me to anoint you as king of his people, Israel. Now listen to this message from the LORD!
091Sm 15:2 This is what the LORD of Heaven's Armies has declared£º I have decided to settle accounts with the nation of Amalek for opposing Israel when they came from Egypt.
091Sm 15:3 Now go and completely destroy¨ç the entire Amalekite nation - men, women, children, babies, cattle, sheep, goats, camels, and donkeys." / ¨ç{The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; also in 15.8, 9, 15, 18, 20, 21}
091Sm 15:4 So Saul mobilized his army at Telaim. There were 200,000 soldiers from Israel and 10,000 men from Judah.
091Sm 15:5 Then Saul and his army went to a town of the Amalekites and lay in wait in the valley.
091Sm 15:6 Saul sent this warning to the Kenites£º "Move away from where the Amalekites live, or you will die with them. For you showed kindness to all the people of Israel when they came up from Egypt." So the Kenites packed up and left.
091Sm 15:7 Then Saul slaughtered the Amalekites from Havilah all the way to Shur, east of Egypt.
091Sm 15:8 He captured Agag, the Amalekite king, but completely destroyed everyone else.
091Sm 15:9 Saul and his men spared Agag's life and kept the best of the sheep and goats, the cattle, the fat calves, and the lambs - everything, in fact, that appealed to them. They destroyed only what was worthless or of poor quality.
091Sm 15:10 Then the LORD said to Samuel,
091Sm 15:11 "I am sorry that I ever made Saul king, for he has not been loyal to me and has refused to obey my command." Samuel was so deeply moved when he heard this that he cried out to the LORD all night.
091Sm 15:12 Early the next morning Samuel went to find Saul. Someone told him, "Saul went to the town of Carmel to set up a monument to himself; then he went on to Gilgal."
091Sm 15:13 When Samuel finally found him, Saul greeted him cheerfully. "May the LORD bless you," he said. "I have carried out the LORD's command!"
091Sm 15:14 "Then what is all the bleating of sheep and goats and the lowing of cattle I hear?" Samuel demanded.
091Sm 15:15 "It's true that the army spared the best of the sheep, goats, and cattle," Saul admitted. "But they are going to sacrifice them to the LORD your God. We have destroyed everything else."
091Sm 15:16 Then Samuel said to Saul, "Stop! Listen to what the LORD told me last night!" "What did he tell you?" Saul asked.
091Sm 15:17 And Samuel told him, "Although you may think little of yourself, are you not the leader of the tribes of Israel? The LORD has anointed you king of Israel.
091Sm 15:18 And the LORD sent you on a mission and told you, 'Go and completely destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, until they are all dead.'
091Sm 15:19 Why haven't you obeyed the LORD? Why did you rush for the plunder and do what was evil in the LORD's sight?"
091Sm 15:20 "But I did obey the LORD," Saul insisted. "I carried out the mission he gave me. I brought back King Agag, but I destroyed everyone else.
091Sm 15:21 Then my troops brought in the best of the sheep, goats, cattle, and plunder to sacrifice to the LORD your God in Gilgal."
091Sm 15:22 But Samuel replied, "What is more pleasing to the LORD£º your burnt offerings and sacrifices or your obedience to his voice? Listen! Obedience is better than sacrifice, and submission is better than offering the fat of rams.
091Sm 15:23 Rebellion is as sinful as witchcraft, and stubbornness as bad as worshiping idols. So because you have rejected the command of the LORD, he has rejected you as king."
091Sm 15:24 Then Saul admitted to Samuel, "Yes, I have sinned. I have disobeyed your instructions and the LORD's command, for I was afraid of the people and did what they demanded.
091Sm 15:25 But now, please forgive my sin and come back with me so that I may worship the LORD."
091Sm 15:26 But Samuel replied, "I will not go back with you! Since you have rejected the LORD's command, he has rejected you as king of Israel."
091Sm 15:27 As Samuel turned to go, Saul tried to hold him back and tore the hem of his robe.
091Sm 15:28 And Samuel said to him, "The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to someone else - one who is better than you.
091Sm 15:29 And he who is the Glory of Israel will not lie, nor will he change his mind, for he is not human that he should change his mind!"
091Sm 15:30 Then Saul pleaded again, "I know I have sinned. But please, at least honor me before the elders of my people and before Israel by coming back with me so that I may worship the LORD your God."
091Sm 15:31 So Samuel finally agreed and went back with him, and Saul worshiped the LORD.
091Sm 15:32 Then Samuel said, "Bring King Agag to me." Agag arrived full of hope, for he thought, "Surely the worst is over, and I have been spared!"¨ç / ¨ç{Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version read Agag arrived hesitantly, for he thought, "Surely this is the bitterness of death"}
091Sm 15:33 But Samuel said, "As your sword has killed the sons of many mothers, now your mother will be childless." And Samuel cut Agag to pieces before the LORD at Gilgal.
091Sm 15:34 Then Samuel went home to Ramah, and Saul returned to his house at Gibeah of Saul.
091Sm 15:35 Samuel never went to meet with Saul again, but he mourned constantly for him. And the LORD was sorry he had ever made Saul king of Israel.
091Sm 16:1 Now the LORD said to Samuel, "You have mourned long enough for Saul. I have rejected him as king of Israel, so fill your flask with olive oil and go to Bethlehem. Find a man named Jesse who lives there, for I have selected one of his sons to be my king."
091Sm 16:2 But Samuel asked, "How can I do that? If Saul hears about it, he will kill me." "Take a heifer with you," the LORD replied, "and say that you have come to make a sacrifice to the LORD.
091Sm 16:3 Invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you which of his sons to anoint for me."
091Sm 16:4 So Samuel did as the LORD instructed. When he arrived at Bethlehem, the elders of the town came trembling to meet him. "What's wrong?" they asked. "Do you come in peace?"
091Sm 16:5 "Yes," Samuel replied. "I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Purify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice." Then Samuel performed the purification rite for Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice, too.
091Sm 16:6 When they arrived, Samuel took one look at Eliab and thought, "Surely this is the LORD's anointed!"
091Sm 16:7 But the LORD said to Samuel, "Don't judge by his appearance or height, for I have rejected him. The LORD doesn't see things the way you see them. People judge by outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart."
091Sm 16:8 Then Jesse told his son Abinadab to step forward and walk in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, "This is not the one the LORD has chosen."
091Sm 16:9 Next Jesse summoned Shimea¨ç, but Samuel said, "Neither is this the one the LORD has chosen." / ¨ç{Hebrew Shammah, a variant spelling of Shimea; compare 1 Chr 2.13; 20.7}
091Sm 16:10 In the same way all seven of Jesse's sons were presented to Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, "The LORD has not chosen any of these."
091Sm 16:11 Then Samuel asked, "Are these all the sons you have?" "There is still the youngest," Jesse replied. "But he's out in the fields watching the sheep and goats." "Send for him at once," Samuel said. "We will not sit down to eat until he arrives."
091Sm 16:12 So Jesse sent for him. He was dark and handsome, with beautiful eyes. And the LORD said, "This is the one; anoint him."
091Sm 16:13 So as David stood there among his brothers, Samuel took the flask of olive oil he had brought and anointed David with the oil. And the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon David from that day on. Then Samuel returned to Ramah.
091Sm 16:14 Now the Spirit of the LORD had left Saul, and the LORD sent a tormenting spirit¨ç that filled him with depression and fear. / ¨ç{Or an evil spirit; also in 16.15, 16, 23}
091Sm 16:15 Some of Saul's servants said to him, "A tormenting spirit from God is troubling you.
091Sm 16:16 Let us find a good musician to play the harp whenever the tormenting spirit troubles you. He will play soothing music, and you will soon be well again."
091Sm 16:17 "All right," Saul said. "Find me someone who plays well, and bring him here."
091Sm 16:18 One of the servants said to Saul, "One of Jesse's sons from Bethlehem is a talented harp player. Not only that - he is a brave warrior, a man of war, and has good judgment. He is also a fine-looking young man, and the LORD is with him."
091Sm 16:19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse to say, "Send me your son David, the shepherd."
091Sm 16:20 Jesse responded by sending David to Saul, along with a young goat, a donkey loaded with bread, and a wineskin full of wine.
091Sm 16:21 So David went to Saul and began serving him. Saul loved David very much, and David became his armor bearer.
091Sm 16:22 Then Saul sent word to Jesse asking, "Please let David remain in my service, for I am very pleased with him."
091Sm 16:23 And whenever the tormenting spirit from God troubled Saul, David would play the harp. Then Saul would feel better, and the tormenting spirit would go away.
091Sm 17:1 The Philistines now mustered their army for battle and camped between Socoh in Judah and Azekah at Ephes-dammim.
091Sm 17:2 Saul countered by gathering his Israelite troops near the valley of Elah.
091Sm 17:3 So the Philistines and Israelites faced each other on opposite hills, with the valley between them.
091Sm 17:4 Then Goliath, a Philistine champion from Gath, came out of the Philistine ranks to face the forces of Israel. He was over nine feet¨ç tall! / ¨ç{Hebrew 6 cubits and 1 span [which totals about 9.75 feet or 3 meters]; Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version read 4 cubits and 1 span [which totals about 6.75 feet or 2 meters]}
091Sm 17:5 He wore a bronze helmet, and his bronze coat of mail weighed 125 pounds¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew 5,000 shekels [57 kilograms]}
091Sm 17:6 He also wore bronze leg armor, and he carried a bronze javelin on his shoulder.
091Sm 17:7 The shaft of his spear was as heavy and thick as a weaver's beam, tipped with an iron spearhead that weighed 15 pounds¨ç. His armor bearer walked ahead of him carrying a shield. / ¨ç{Hebrew 600 shekels [6.8 kilograms]}
091Sm 17:8 Goliath stood and shouted a taunt across to the Israelites. "Why are you all coming out to fight?" he called. "I am the Philistine champion, but you are only the servants of Saul. Choose one man to come down here and fight me!
091Sm 17:9 If he kills me, then we will be your slaves. But if I kill him, you will be our slaves!
091Sm 17:10 I defy the armies of Israel today! Send me a man who will fight me!"
091Sm 17:11 When Saul and the Israelites heard this, they were terrified and deeply shaken.
091Sm 17:12 Now David was the son of a man named Jesse, an Ephrathite from Bethlehem in the land of Judah. Jesse was an old man at that time, and he had eight sons.
091Sm 17:13 Jesse's three oldest sons - Eliab, Abinadab, and Shimea¨ç - had already joined Saul's army to fight the Philistines. / ¨ç{Hebrew Shammah, a variant spelling of Shimea; compare 1 Chr 2.13; 20.7}
091Sm 17:14 David was the youngest son. David's three oldest brothers stayed with Saul's army,
091Sm 17:15 but David went back and forth so he could help his father with the sheep in Bethlehem.
091Sm 17:16 For forty days, every morning and evening, the Philistine champion strutted in front of the Israelite army.
091Sm 17:17 One day Jesse said to David, "Take this basket¨ç of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread, and carry them quickly to your brothers. / ¨ç{Hebrew ephah [20 quarts or 22 liters]}
091Sm 17:18 And give these ten cuts of cheese to their captain. See how your brothers are getting along, and bring back a report on how they are doing¨ç." / ¨ç{Hebrew and take their pledge}
091Sm 17:19 David's brothers were with Saul and the Israelite army at the valley of Elah, fighting against the Philistines.
091Sm 17:20 So David left the sheep with another shepherd and set out early the next morning with the gifts, as Jesse had directed him. He arrived at the camp just as the Israelite army was leaving for the battlefield with shouts and battle cries.
091Sm 17:21 Soon the Israelite and Philistine forces stood facing each other, army against army.
091Sm 17:22 David left his things with the keeper of supplies and hurried out to the ranks to greet his brothers.
091Sm 17:23 As he was talking with them, Goliath, the Philistine champion from Gath, came out from the Philistine ranks. Then David heard him shout his usual taunt to the army of Israel.
091Sm 17:24 As soon as the Israelite army saw him, they began to run away in fright.
091Sm 17:25 "Have you seen the giant?" the men asked. "He comes out each day to defy Israel. The king has offered a huge reward to anyone who kills him. He will give that man one of his daughters for a wife, and the man's entire family will be exempted from paying taxes!"
091Sm 17:26 David asked the soldiers standing nearby, "What will a man get for killing this Philistine and ending his defiance of Israel? Who is this pagan Philistine anyway, that he is allowed to defy the armies of the living God?"
091Sm 17:27 And these men gave David the same reply. They said, "Yes, that is the reward for killing him."
091Sm 17:28 But when David's oldest brother, Eliab, heard David talking to the men, he was angry. "What are you doing around here anyway?" he demanded. "What about those few sheep you're supposed to be taking care of? I know about your pride and deceit. You just want to see the battle!"
091Sm 17:29 "What have I done now?" David replied. "I was only asking a question!"
091Sm 17:30 He walked over to some others and asked them the same thing and received the same answer.
091Sm 17:31 Then David's question was reported to King Saul, and the king sent for him.
091Sm 17:32 "Don't worry about this Philistine," David told Saul. "I'll go fight him!"
091Sm 17:33 "Don't be ridiculous!" Saul replied. "There's no way you can fight this Philistine and possibly win! You're only a boy, and he's been a man of war since his youth."
091Sm 17:34 But David persisted. "I have been taking care of my father's sheep and goats," he said. "When a lion or a bear comes to steal a lamb from the flock,
091Sm 17:35 I go after it with a club and rescue the lamb from its mouth. If the animal turns on me, I catch it by the jaw and club it to death.
091Sm 17:36 I have done this to both lions and bears, and I'll do it to this pagan Philistine, too, for he has defied the armies of the living God!
091Sm 17:37 The LORD who rescued me from the claws of the lion and the bear will rescue me from this Philistine!" Saul finally consented. "All right, go ahead," he said. "And may the LORD be with you!"
091Sm 17:38 Then Saul gave David his own armor - a bronze helmet and a coat of mail.
091Sm 17:39 David put it on, strapped the sword over it, and took a step or two to see what it was like, for he had never worn such things before. "I can't go in these," he protested to Saul. "I'm not used to them." So David took them off again.
091Sm 17:40 He picked up five smooth stones from a stream and put them into his shepherd's bag. Then, armed only with his shepherd's staff and sling, he started across the valley to fight the Philistine.
091Sm 17:41 Goliath walked out toward David with his shield bearer ahead of him,
091Sm 17:42 sneering in contempt at this ruddy-faced boy.
091Sm 17:43 "Am I a dog," he roared at David, "that you come at me with a stick?" And he cursed David by the names of his gods.
091Sm 17:44 "Come over here, and I'll give your flesh to the birds and wild animals!" Goliath yelled.
091Sm 17:45 David replied to the Philistine, "You come to me with sword, spear, and javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of Heaven's Armies - the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied.
091Sm 17:46 Today the LORD will conquer you, and I will kill you and cut off your head. And then I will give the dead bodies of your men to the birds and wild animals, and the whole world will know that there is a God in Israel!
091Sm 17:47 And everyone assembled here will know that the LORD rescues his people, but not with sword and spear. This is the LORD's battle, and he will give you to us!"
091Sm 17:48 As Goliath moved closer to attack, David quickly ran out to meet him.
091Sm 17:49 Reaching into his shepherd's bag and taking out a stone, he hurled it with his sling and hit the Philistine in the forehead. The stone sank in, and Goliath stumbled and fell face down on the ground.
091Sm 17:50 So David triumphed over the Philistine with only a sling and a stone, for he had no sword.
091Sm 17:51 Then David ran over and pulled Goliath's sword from its sheath. David used it to kill him and cut off his head. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they turned and ran.
091Sm 17:52 Then the men of Israel and Judah gave a great shout of triumph and rushed after the Philistines, chasing them as far as Gath¨ç and the gates of Ekron. The bodies of the dead and wounded Philistines were strewn all along the road from Shaaraim, as far as Gath and Ekron. / ¨ç{As in some Greek manuscripts; Hebrew reads a valley}
091Sm 17:53 Then the Israelite army returned and plundered the deserted Philistine camp.
091Sm 17:54 (David took the Philistine's head to Jerusalem, but he stored the man's armor in his own tent.)
091Sm 17:55 As Saul watched David go out to fight the Philistine, he asked Abner, the commander of his army, "Abner, whose son is this young man?" "I really don't know," Abner declared.
091Sm 17:56 "Well, find out who he is!" the king told him.
091Sm 17:57 As soon as David returned from killing Goliath, Abner brought him to Saul with the Philistine's head still in his hand.
091Sm 17:58 "Tell me about your father, young man," Saul said.And David replied, "His name is Jesse, and we live in Bethlehem."
091Sm 18:1 After David had finished talking with Saul, he met Jonathan, the king's son. There was an immediate bond between them, for Jonathan loved David.
091Sm 18:2 From that day on Saul kept David with him and wouldn't let him return home.
091Sm 18:3 And Jonathan made a solemn pact with David, because he loved him as he loved himself.
091Sm 18:4 Jonathan sealed the pact by taking off his robe and giving it to David, together with his tunic, sword, bow, and belt.
091Sm 18:5 Whatever Saul asked David to do, David did it successfully. So Saul made him a commander over the men of war, an appointment that was welcomed by the people and Saul's officers alike.
091Sm 18:6 When the victorious Israelite army was returning home after David had killed the Philistine, women from all the towns of Israel came out to meet King Saul. They sang and danced for joy with tambourines and cymbals¨ç. / ¨ç{The type of instrument represented by the word cymbals is uncertain}
091Sm 18:7 This was their song£º "Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands!"
091Sm 18:8 This made Saul very angry. "What's this?" he said. "They credit David with ten thousands and me with only thousands. Next they'll be making him their king!"
091Sm 18:9 So from that time on Saul kept a jealous eye on David.
091Sm 18:10 The very next day a tormenting spirit¨ç from God overwhelmed Saul, and he began to rave in his house like a madman. David was playing the harp, as he did each day. But Saul had a spear in his hand, / ¨ç{Or an evil spirit}
091Sm 18:11 and he suddenly hurled it at David, intending to pin him to the wall. But David escaped him twice.
091Sm 18:12 Saul was then afraid of David, for the LORD was with David and had turned away from Saul.
091Sm 18:13 Finally, Saul sent him away and appointed him commander over 1,000 men, and David faithfully led his troops into battle.
091Sm 18:14 David continued to succeed in everything he did, for the LORD was with him.
091Sm 18:15 When Saul recognized this, he became even more afraid of him.
091Sm 18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David because he was so successful at leading his troops into battle.
091Sm 18:17 One day Saul said to David, "I am ready to give you my older daughter, Merab, as your wife. But first you must prove yourself to be a real warrior by fighting the LORD's battles." For Saul thought, "I'll send him out against the Philistines and let them kill him rather than doing it myself."
091Sm 18:18 "Who am I, and what is my family in Israel that I should be the king's son-in-law?" David exclaimed. "My father's family is nothing!"
091Sm 18:19 So¨ç when the time came for Saul to give his daughter Merab in marriage to David, he gave her instead to Adriel, a man from Meholah. / ¨ç{Or But}
091Sm 18:20 In the meantime, Saul's daughter Michal had fallen in love with David, and Saul was delighted when he heard about it.
091Sm 18:21 "Here's another chance to see him killed by the Philistines!" Saul said to himself. But to David he said, "Today you have a second chance to become my son-in-law!"
091Sm 18:22 Then Saul told his men to say to David, "The king really likes you, and so do we. Why don't you accept the king's offer and become his son-in-law?"
091Sm 18:23 When Saul's men said these things to David, he replied, "How can a poor man from a humble family afford the bride price for the daughter of a king?"
091Sm 18:24 When Saul's men reported this back to the king,
091Sm 18:25 he told them, "Tell David that all I want for the bride price is 100 Philistine foreskins! Vengeance on my enemies is all I really want." But what Saul had in mind was that David would be killed in the fight.
091Sm 18:26 David was delighted to accept the offer. Before the time limit expired,
091Sm 18:27 he and his men went out and killed 200 Philistines. Then David fulfilled the king's requirement by presenting all their foreskins to him. So Saul gave his daughter Michal to David to be his wife.
091Sm 18:28 When Saul realized that the LORD was with David and how much his daughter Michal loved him,
091Sm 18:29 Saul became even more afraid of him, and he remained David's enemy for the rest of his life.
091Sm 18:30 Every time the commanders of the Philistines attacked, David was more successful against them than all the rest of Saul's officers. So David's name became very famous.
091Sm 19:1 Saul now urged his servants and his son Jonathan to assassinate David. But Jonathan, because of his strong affection for David,
091Sm 19:2 told him what his father was planning. "Tomorrow morning," he warned him, "you must find a hiding place out in the fields.
091Sm 19:3 I'll ask my father to go out there with me, and I'll talk to him about you. Then I'll tell you everything I can find out."
091Sm 19:4 The next morning Jonathan spoke with his father about David, saying many good things about him. "The king must not sin against his servant David," Jonathan said. "He's never done anything to harm you. He has always helped you in any way he could.
091Sm 19:5 Have you forgotten about the time he risked his life to kill the Philistine giant and how the LORD brought a great victory to all Israel as a result? You were certainly happy about it then. Why should you murder an innocent man like David? There is no reason for it at all!"
091Sm 19:6 So Saul listened to Jonathan and vowed, "As surely as the LORD lives, David will not be killed."
091Sm 19:7 Afterward Jonathan called David and told him what had happened. Then he brought David to Saul, and David served in the court as before.
091Sm 19:8 War broke out again after that, and David led his troops against the Philistines. He attacked them with such fury that they all ran away.
091Sm 19:9 But one day when Saul was sitting at home, with spear in hand, the tormenting spirit¨ç from the LORD suddenly came upon him again. As David played his harp, / ¨ç{Or evil spirit}
091Sm 19:10 Saul hurled his spear at David. But David dodged out of the way, and leaving the spear stuck in the wall, he fled and escaped into the night.
091Sm 19:11 Then Saul sent troops to watch David's house. They were told to kill David when he came out the next morning. But Michal, David's wife, warned him, "If you don't escape tonight, you will be dead by morning."
091Sm 19:12 So she helped him climb out through a window, and he fled and escaped.
091Sm 19:13 Then she took an idol¨ç and put it in his bed, covered it with blankets, and put a cushion of goat's hair at its head. / ¨ç{Hebrew teraphim; also in 19.16}
091Sm 19:14 When the troops came to arrest David, she told them he was sick and couldn't get out of bed.
091Sm 19:15 But Saul sent the troops back to get David. He ordered, "Bring him to me in his bed so I can kill him!"
091Sm 19:16 But when they came to carry David out, they discovered that it was only an idol in the bed with a cushion of goat's hair at its head.
091Sm 19:17 "Why have you betrayed me like this and let my enemy escape?" Saul demanded of Michal. "I had to," Michal replied. "He threatened to kill me if I didn't help him."
091Sm 19:18 So David escaped and went to Ramah to see Samuel, and he told him all that Saul had done to him. Then Samuel took David with him to live at Naioth.
091Sm 19:19 When the report reached Saul that David was at Naioth in Ramah,
091Sm 19:20 he sent troops to capture him. But when they arrived and saw Samuel leading a group of prophets who were prophesying, the Spirit of God came upon Saul's men, and they also began to prophesy.
091Sm 19:21 When Saul heard what had happened, he sent other troops, but they, too, prophesied! The same thing happened a third time.
091Sm 19:22 Finally, Saul himself went to Ramah and arrived at the great well in Secu. "Where are Samuel and David?" he demanded. "They are at Naioth in Ramah," someone told him.
091Sm 19:23 But on the way to Naioth in Ramah the Spirit of God came even upon Saul, and he, too, began to prophesy all the way to Naioth!
091Sm 19:24 He tore off his clothes and lay naked on the ground all day and all night, prophesying in the presence of Samuel. The people who were watching exclaimed, "What? Is even Saul a prophet?"
091Sm 20:1 David now fled from Naioth in Ramah and found Jonathan. "What have I done?" he exclaimed. "What is my crime? How have I offended your father that he is so determined to kill me?"
091Sm 20:2 "That's not true!" Jonathan protested. "You're not going to die. He always tells me everything he's going to do, even the little things. I know my father wouldn't hide something like this from me. It just isn't so!"
091Sm 20:3 Then David took an oath before Jonathan and said, "Your father knows perfectly well about our friendship, so he has said to himself, 'I won't tell Jonathan - why should I hurt him?' But I swear to you that I am only a step away from death! I swear it by the LORD and by your own soul!"
091Sm 20:4 "Tell me what I can do to help you," Jonathan exclaimed.
091Sm 20:5 David replied, "Tomorrow we celebrate the new moon festival. I've always eaten with the king on this occasion, but tomorrow I'll hide in the field and stay there until the evening of the third day.
091Sm 20:6 If your father asks where I am, tell him I asked permission to go home to Bethlehem for an annual family sacrifice.
091Sm 20:7 If he says, 'Fine!' you will know all is well. But if he is angry and loses his temper, you will know he is determined to kill me.
091Sm 20:8 Show me this loyalty as my sworn friend - for we made a solemn pact before the LORD - or kill me yourself if I have sinned against your father. But please don't betray me to him!"
091Sm 20:9 "Never!" Jonathan exclaimed. "You know that if I had the slightest notion my father was planning to kill you, I would tell you at once."
091Sm 20:10 Then David asked, "How will I know whether or not your father is angry?"
091Sm 20:11 "Come out to the field with me," Jonathan replied. And they went out there together.
091Sm 20:12 Then Jonathan told David, "I promise by the LORD, the God of Israel, that by this time tomorrow, or the next day at the latest, I will talk to my father and let you know at once how he feels about you. If he speaks favorably about you, I will let you know.
091Sm 20:13 But if he is angry and wants you killed, may the LORD strike me and even kill me if I don't warn you so you can escape and live. May the LORD be with you as he used to be with my father.
091Sm 20:14 And may you treat me with the faithful love of the LORD as long as I live. But if I die,
091Sm 20:15 treat my family with this faithful love, even when the LORD destroys all your enemies from the face of the earth."
091Sm 20:16 So Jonathan made a solemn pact with David¨ç, saying, "May the LORD destroy all your enemies!" / ¨ç{Hebrew with the house of David}
091Sm 20:17 And Jonathan made David reaffirm his vow of friendship again, for Jonathan loved David as he loved himself.
091Sm 20:18 Then Jonathan said, "Tomorrow we celebrate the new moon festival. You will be missed when your place at the table is empty.
091Sm 20:19 The day after tomorrow, toward evening, go to the place where you hid before, and wait there by the stone pile¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew the stone Ezel. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
091Sm 20:20 I will come out and shoot three arrows to the side of the stone pile as though I were shooting at a target.
091Sm 20:21 Then I will send a boy to bring the arrows back. If you hear me tell him, 'They're on this side,' then you will know, as surely as the LORD lives, that all is well, and there is no trouble.
091Sm 20:22 But if I tell him, 'Go farther - the arrows are still ahead of you,' then it will mean that you must leave immediately, for the LORD is sending you away.
091Sm 20:23 And may the LORD make us keep our promises to each other, for he has witnessed them."
091Sm 20:24 So David hid himself in the field, and when the new moon festival began, the king sat down to eat.
091Sm 20:25 He sat at his usual place against the wall, with Jonathan sitting opposite him¨ç and Abner beside him. But David's place was empty. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads with Jonathan standing}
091Sm 20:26 Saul didn't say anything about it that day, for he said to himself, "Something must have made David ceremonially unclean."
091Sm 20:27 But when David's place was empty again the next day, Saul asked Jonathan, "Why hasn't the son of Jesse been here for the meal either yesterday or today?"
091Sm 20:28 Jonathan replied, "David earnestly asked me if he could go to Bethlehem.
091Sm 20:29 He said, 'Please let me go, for we are having a family sacrifice. My brother demanded that I be there. So please let me get away to see my brothers.' That's why he isn't here at the king's table."
091Sm 20:30 Saul boiled with rage at Jonathan. "You stupid son of a whore!"¨ç he swore at him. "Do you think I don't know that you want him to be king in your place, shaming yourself and your mother? / ¨ç{Hebrew You son of a perverse and rebellious woman}
091Sm 20:31 As long as that son of Jesse is alive, you'll never be king. Now go and get him so I can kill him!"
091Sm 20:32 "But why should he be put to death?" Jonathan asked his father. "What has he done?"
091Sm 20:33 Then Saul hurled his spear at Jonathan, intending to kill him. So at last Jonathan realized that his father was really determined to kill David.
091Sm 20:34 Jonathan left the table in fierce anger and refused to eat on that second day of the festival, for he was crushed by his father's shameful behavior toward David.
091Sm 20:35 The next morning, as agreed, Jonathan went out into the field and took a young boy with him to gather his arrows.
091Sm 20:36 "Start running," he told the boy, "so you can find the arrows as I shoot them." So the boy ran, and Jonathan shot an arrow beyond him.
091Sm 20:37 When the boy had almost reached the arrow, Jonathan shouted, "The arrow is still ahead of you.
091Sm 20:38 Hurry, hurry, don't wait." So the boy quickly gathered up the arrows and ran back to his master.
091Sm 20:39 He, of course, suspected nothing; only Jonathan and David understood the signal.
091Sm 20:40 Then Jonathan gave his bow and arrows to the boy and told him to take them back to town.
091Sm 20:41 As soon as the boy was gone, David came out from where he had been hiding near the stone pile¨ç. Then David bowed three times to Jonathan with his face to the ground. Both of them were in tears as they embraced each other and said good-bye, especially David. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads near the south edge}
091Sm 20:42 At last Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace, for we have sworn loyalty to each other in the LORD's name. The LORD is the witness of a bond between us and our children forever." Then David left, and Jonathan returned to the town¨ç. / ¨ç{This sentence is numbered 21.1 in Hebrew text}
091Sm 21:1 ¨çDavid went to the town of Nob to see Ahimelech the priest. Ahimelech trembled when he saw him. "Why are you alone?" he asked. "Why is no one with you?" / ¨ç{Verses 21.1-15 are numbered 21.2-16 in Hebrew text}
091Sm 21:2 "The king has sent me on a private matter," David said. "He told me not to tell anyone why I am here. I have told my men where to meet me later.
091Sm 21:3 Now, what is there to eat? Give me five loaves of bread or anything else you have."
091Sm 21:4 "We don't have any regular bread," the priest replied. "But there is the holy bread, which you can have if your young men have not slept with any women recently."
091Sm 21:5 "Don't worry," David replied. "I never allow my men to be with women when they are on a campaign. And since they stay clean even on ordinary trips, how much more on this one!"
091Sm 21:6 Since there was no other food available, the priest gave him the holy bread - the Bread of the Presence that was placed before the LORD in the Tabernacle. It had just been replaced that day with fresh bread.
091Sm 21:7 Now Doeg the Edomite, Saul's chief herdsman, was there that day, having been detained before the LORD¨ç. / ¨ç{The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
091Sm 21:8 David asked Ahimelech, "Do you have a spear or sword? The king's business was so urgent that I didn't even have time to grab a weapon!"
091Sm 21:9 "I only have the sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the valley of Elah," the priest replied. "It is wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod. Take that if you want it, for there is nothing else here." "There is nothing like it!" David replied. "Give it to me!"
091Sm 21:10 So David escaped from Saul and went to King Achish of Gath.
091Sm 21:11 But the officers of Achish were unhappy about his being there. "Isn't this David, the king of the land?" they asked. "Isn't he the one the people honor with dances, singing, 'Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
091Sm 21:12 David heard these comments and was very afraid of what King Achish of Gath might do to him.
091Sm 21:13 So he pretended to be insane, scratching on doors and drooling down his beard.
091Sm 21:14 Finally, King Achish said to his men, "Must you bring me a madman?
091Sm 21:15 We already have enough of them around here! Why should I let someone like this be my guest?"
091Sm 22:1 So David left Gath and escaped to the cave of Adullam. Soon his brothers and all his other relatives joined him there.
091Sm 22:2 Then others began coming - men who were in trouble or in debt or who were just discontented - until David was the captain of about 400 men.
091Sm 22:3 Later David went to Mizpeh in Moab, where he asked the king, "Please allow my father and mother to live here with you until I know what God is going to do for me."
091Sm 22:4 So David's parents stayed in Moab with the king during the entire time David was living in his stronghold.
091Sm 22:5 One day the prophet Gad told David, "Leave the stronghold and return to the land of Judah." So David went to the forest of Hereth.
091Sm 22:6 The news of his arrival in Judah soon reached Saul. At the time, the king was sitting beneath the tamarisk tree on the hill at Gibeah, holding his spear and surrounded by his officers.
091Sm 22:7 "Listen here, you men of Benjamin!" Saul shouted to his officers when he heard the news. "Has that son of Jesse promised every one of you fields and vineyards? Has he promised to make you all generals and captains in his army?¨ç / ¨ç{Hebrew commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds?}
091Sm 22:8 Is that why you have conspired against me? For not one of you told me when my own son made a solemn pact with the son of Jesse. You're not even sorry for me. Think of it! My own son - encouraging him to kill me, as he is trying to do this very day!"
091Sm 22:9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing there with Saul's men, spoke up. "When I was at Nob," he said, "I saw the son of Jesse talking to the priest, Ahimelech son of Ahitub.
091Sm 22:10 Ahimelech consulted the LORD for him. Then he gave him food and the sword of Goliath the Philistine."
091Sm 22:11 King Saul immediately sent for Ahimelech and all his family, who served as priests at Nob.
091Sm 22:12 When they arrived, Saul shouted at him, "Listen to me, you son of Ahitub!" "What is it, my king?" Ahimelech asked.
091Sm 22:13 "Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me?" Saul demanded. "Why did you give him food and a sword? Why have you consulted God for him? Why have you encouraged him to kill me, as he is trying to do this very day?"
091Sm 22:14 "But sir," Ahimelech replied, "is anyone among all your servants as faithful as David, your son-in-law? Why, he is the captain of your bodyguard and a highly honored member of your household!
091Sm 22:15 This was certainly not the first time I had consulted God for him! May the king not accuse me and my family in this matter, for I knew nothing at all of any plot against you."
091Sm 22:16 "You will surely die, Ahimelech, along with your entire family!" the king shouted.
091Sm 22:17 And he ordered his bodyguards, "Kill these priests of the LORD, for they are allies and conspirators with David! They knew he was running away from me, but they didn't tell me!" But Saul's men refused to kill the LORD's priests.
091Sm 22:18 Then the king said to Doeg, "You do it." So Doeg the Edomite turned on them and killed them that day, eighty-five priests in all, still wearing their priestly garments.
091Sm 22:19 Then he went to Nob, the town of the priests, and killed the priests' families - men and women, children and babies - and all the cattle, donkeys, sheep, and goats.
091Sm 22:20 Only Abiathar, one of the sons of Ahimelech, escaped and fled to David.
091Sm 22:21 When he told David that Saul had killed the priests of the LORD,
091Sm 22:22 David exclaimed, "I knew it! When I saw Doeg the Edomite there that day, I knew he was sure to tell Saul. Now I have caused the death of all your father's family.
091Sm 22:23 Stay here with me, and don't be afraid. I will protect you with my own life, for the same person wants to kill us both."
091Sm 23:1 One day news came to David that the Philistines were at Keilah stealing grain from the threshing floors.
091Sm 23:2 David asked the LORD, "Should I go and attack them?" "Yes, go and save Keilah," the LORD told him.
091Sm 23:3 But David's men said, "We're afraid even here in Judah. We certainly don't want to go to Keilah to fight the whole Philistine army!"
091Sm 23:4 So David asked the LORD again, and again the LORD replied, "Go down to Keilah, for I will help you conquer the Philistines."
091Sm 23:5 So David and his men went to Keilah. They slaughtered the Philistines and took all their livestock and rescued the people of Keilah.
091Sm 23:6 Now when Abiathar son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he brought the ephod with him.
091Sm 23:7 Saul soon learned that David was at Keilah. "Good!" he exclaimed. "We've got him now! God has handed him over to me, for he has trapped himself in a walled town!"
091Sm 23:8 So Saul mobilized his entire army to march to Keilah and besiege David and his men.
091Sm 23:9 But David learned of Saul's plan and told Abiathar the priest to bring the ephod and ask the LORD what he should do.
091Sm 23:10 Then David prayed, "O LORD, God of Israel, I have heard that Saul is planning to come and destroy Keilah because I am here.
091Sm 23:11 Will the leaders of Keilah betray me to him?¨ç And will Saul actually come as I have heard? O LORD, God of Israel, please tell me." And the LORD said, "He will come." / ¨ç{Some manuscripts lack the first sentence of 23.11}
091Sm 23:12 Again David asked, "Will the leaders of Keilah betray me and my men to Saul?" And the LORD replied, "Yes, they will betray you."
091Sm 23:13 So David and his men - about 600 of them now - left Keilah and began roaming the countryside. Word soon reached Saul that David had escaped, so he didn't go to Keilah after all.
091Sm 23:14 David now stayed in the strongholds of the wilderness and in the hill country of Ziph. Saul hunted him day after day, but God didn't let Saul find him.
091Sm 23:15 One day near Horesh, David received the news that Saul was on the way to Ziph to search for him and kill him.
091Sm 23:16 Jonathan went to find David and encouraged him to stay strong in his faith in God.
091Sm 23:17 "Don't be afraid," Jonathan reassured him. "My father will never find you! You are going to be the king of Israel, and I will be next to you, as my father, Saul, is well aware."
091Sm 23:18 So the two of them renewed their solemn pact before the LORD. Then Jonathan returned home, while David stayed at Horesh.
091Sm 23:19 But now the men of Ziph went to Saul in Gibeah and betrayed David to him. "We know where David is hiding," they said. "He is in the strongholds of Horesh on the hill of Hakilah, which is in the southern part of Jeshimon.
091Sm 23:20 Come down whenever you're ready, O king, and we will catch him and hand him over to you!"
091Sm 23:21 "The LORD bless you," Saul said. "At last someone is concerned about me!
091Sm 23:22 Go and check again to be sure of where he is staying and who has seen him there, for I know that he is very crafty.
091Sm 23:23 Discover his hiding places, and come back when you are sure. Then I'll go with you. And if he is in the area at all, I'll track him down, even if I have to search every hiding place in Judah!"
091Sm 23:24 So the men of Ziph returned home ahead of Saul.Meanwhile, David and his men had moved into the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah Valley south of Jeshimon.
091Sm 23:25 When David heard that Saul and his men were searching for him, he went even farther into the wilderness to the great rock, and he remained there in the wilderness of Maon. But Saul kept after him in the wilderness.
091Sm 23:26 Saul and David were now on opposite sides of a mountain. Just as Saul and his men began to close in on David and his men,
091Sm 23:27 an urgent message reached Saul that the Philistines were raiding Israel again.
091Sm 23:28 So Saul quit chasing David and returned to fight the Philistines. Ever since that time, the place where David was camped has been called the Rock of Escape¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew Sela-hammahlekoth}
091Sm 23:29 ¨çDavid then went to live in the strongholds of En-gedi. / ¨ç{Verse 23.29 is numbered 24.1 in Hebrew text}
091Sm 24:1 ¨çAfter Saul returned from fighting the Philistines, he was told that David had gone into the wilderness of En-gedi. / ¨ç{Verses 24.1-22 are numbered 24.2-23 in Hebrew text}
091Sm 24:2 So Saul chose 3,000 elite troops from all Israel and went to search for David and his men near the rocks of the wild goats.
091Sm 24:3 At the place where the road passes some sheepfolds, Saul went into a cave to relieve himself. But as it happened, David and his men were hiding farther back in that very cave!
091Sm 24:4 "Now's your opportunity!" David's men whispered to him. "Today the LORD is telling you, 'I will certainly put your enemy into your power, to do with as you wish.'" So David crept forward and cut off a piece of the hem of Saul's robe.
091Sm 24:5 But then David's conscience began bothering him because he had cut Saul's robe.
091Sm 24:6 "The LORD knows I shouldn't have done that to my lord the king," he said to his men. "The LORD forbid that I should do this to my lord the king and attack the LORD's anointed one, for the LORD himself has chosen him."
091Sm 24:7 So David restrained his men and did not let them kill Saul. After Saul had left the cave and gone on his way,
091Sm 24:8 David came out and shouted after him, "My lord the king!" And when Saul looked around, David bowed low before him.
091Sm 24:9 Then he shouted to Saul, "Why do you listen to the people who say I am trying to harm you?
091Sm 24:10 This very day you can see with your own eyes it isn't true. For the LORD placed you at my mercy back there in the cave. Some of my men told me to kill you, but I spared you. For I said, 'I will never harm the king - he is the LORD's anointed one.'
091Sm 24:11 Look, my father, at what I have in my hand. It is a piece of the hem of your robe! I cut it off, but I didn't kill you. This proves that I am not trying to harm you and that I have not sinned against you, even though you have been hunting for me to kill me.
091Sm 24:12 "May the LORD judge between us. Perhaps the LORD will punish you for what you are trying to do to me, but I will never harm you.
091Sm 24:13 As that old proverb says, 'From evil people come evil deeds.' So you can be sure I will never harm you.
091Sm 24:14 Who is the king of Israel trying to catch anyway? Should he spend his time chasing one who is as worthless as a dead dog or a single flea?
091Sm 24:15 May the LORD therefore judge which of us is right and punish the guilty one. He is my advocate, and he will rescue me from your power!"
091Sm 24:16 When David had finished speaking, Saul called back, "Is that really you, my son David?" Then he began to cry.
091Sm 24:17 And he said to David, "You are a better man than I am, for you have repaid me good for evil.
091Sm 24:18 Yes, you have been amazingly kind to me today, for when the LORD put me in a place where you could have killed me, you didn't do it.
091Sm 24:19 Who else would let his enemy get away when he had him in his power? May the LORD reward you well for the kindness you have shown me today.
091Sm 24:20 And now I realize that you are surely going to be king, and that the kingdom of Israel will flourish under your rule.
091Sm 24:21 Now swear to me by the LORD that when that happens you will not kill my family and destroy my line of descendants!"
091Sm 24:22 So David promised this to Saul with an oath. Then Saul went home, but David and his men went back to their stronghold.
091Sm 25:1 Now Samuel died, and all Israel gathered for his funeral. They buried him at his house in Ramah. Then David moved down to the wilderness of Maon¨ç. / ¨ç{As in Greek version (see also 25.2); Hebrew reads Paran}
091Sm 25:2 There was a wealthy man from Maon who owned property near the town of Carmel. He had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats, and it was sheep-shearing time.
091Sm 25:3 This man's name was Nabal, and his wife, Abigail, was a sensible and beautiful woman. But Nabal, a descendant of Caleb, was crude and mean in all his dealings.
091Sm 25:4 When David heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep,
091Sm 25:5 he sent ten of his young men to Carmel with this message for Nabal.
091Sm 25:6 "Peace and prosperity to you, your family, and everything you own!
091Sm 25:7 I am told that it is sheep-shearing time. While your shepherds stayed among us near Carmel, we never harmed them, and nothing was ever stolen from them.
091Sm 25:8 Ask your own men, and they will tell you this is true. So would you be kind to us, since we have come at a time of celebration? Please share any provisions you might have on hand with us and with your friend David."
091Sm 25:9 David's young men gave this message to Nabal in David's name, and they waited for a reply.
091Sm 25:10 "Who is this fellow David?" Nabal sneered to the young men. "Who does this son of Jesse think he is? There are lots of servants these days who run away from their masters.
091Sm 25:11 Should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I've slaughtered for my shearers and give it to a band of outlaws who come from who knows where?"
091Sm 25:12 So David's young men returned and told him what Nabal had said.
091Sm 25:13 "Get your swords!" was David's reply as he strapped on his own. Then 400 men started off with David, and 200 remained behind to guard their equipment.
091Sm 25:14 Meanwhile, one of Nabal's servants went to Abigail and told her, "David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our master, but he screamed insults at them.
091Sm 25:15 These men have been very good to us, and we never suffered any harm from them. Nothing was stolen from us the whole time they were with us.
091Sm 25:16 In fact, day and night they were like a wall of protection to us and the sheep.
091Sm 25:17 You need to know this and figure out what to do, for there is going to be trouble for our master and his whole family. He's so ill-tempered that no one can even talk to him!"
091Sm 25:18 Abigail wasted no time. She quickly gathered 200 loaves of bread, two wineskins full of wine, five sheep that had been slaughtered, nearly a bushel¨ç of roasted grain, 100 clusters of raisins, and 200 fig cakes. She packed them on donkeys / ¨ç{Hebrew 5 seahs [30 liters]}
091Sm 25:19 and said to her servants, "Go on ahead. I will follow you shortly." But she didn't tell her husband Nabal what she was doing.
091Sm 25:20 As she was riding her donkey into a mountain ravine, she saw David and his men coming toward her.
091Sm 25:21 David had just been saying, "A lot of good it did to help this fellow. We protected his flocks in the wilderness, and nothing he owned was lost or stolen. But he has repaid me evil for good.
091Sm 25:22 May God strike me and kill me¨ç if even one man of his household is still alive tomorrow morning!" / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads May God strike and kill the enemies of David}
091Sm 25:23 When Abigail saw David, she quickly got off her donkey and bowed low before him.
091Sm 25:24 She fell at his feet and said, "I accept all blame in this matter, my lord. Please listen to what I have to say.
091Sm 25:25 I know Nabal is a wicked and ill-tempered man; please don't pay any attention to him. He is a fool, just as his name suggests¨ç. But I never even saw the young men you sent. / ¨ç{The name Nabal means "fool."}
091Sm 25:26 "Now, my lord, as surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, since the LORD has kept you from murdering and taking vengeance into your own hands, let all your enemies and those who try to harm you be as cursed as Nabal is.
091Sm 25:27 And here is a present that I, your servant, have brought to you and your young men.
091Sm 25:28 Please forgive me if I have offended you in any way. The LORD will surely reward you with a lasting dynasty, for you are fighting the LORD's battles. And you have not done wrong throughout your entire life.
091Sm 25:29 "Even when you are chased by those who seek to kill you, your life is safe in the care of the LORD your God, secure in his treasure pouch! But the lives of your enemies will disappear like stones shot from a sling!
091Sm 25:30 When the LORD has done all he promised and has made you leader of Israel,
091Sm 25:31 don't let this be a blemish on your record. Then your conscience won't have to bear the staggering burden of needless bloodshed and vengeance. And when the LORD has done these great things for you, please remember me, your servant!"
091Sm 25:32 David replied to Abigail, "Praise the LORD, the God of Israel, who has sent you to meet me today!
091Sm 25:33 Thank God for your good sense! Bless you for keeping me from murder and from carrying out vengeance with my own hands.
091Sm 25:34 For I swear by the LORD, the God of Israel, who has kept me from hurting you, that if you had not hurried out to meet me, not one of Nabal's men would still be alive tomorrow morning."
091Sm 25:35 Then David accepted her present and told her, "Return home in peace. I have heard what you said. We will not kill your husband."
091Sm 25:36 When Abigail arrived home, she found that Nabal was throwing a big party and was celebrating like a king. He was very drunk, so she didn't tell him anything about her meeting with David until dawn the next day.
091Sm 25:37 In the morning when Nabal was sober, his wife told him what had happened. As a result he had a stroke¨ç, and he lay paralyzed on his bed like a stone. / ¨ç{Hebrew his heart failed him}
091Sm 25:38 About ten days later, the LORD struck him, and he died.
091Sm 25:39 When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, "Praise the LORD, who has avenged the insult I received from Nabal and has kept me from doing it myself. Nabal has received the punishment for his sin." Then David sent messengers to Abigail to ask her to become his wife.
091Sm 25:40 When the messengers arrived at Carmel, they told Abigail, "David has sent us to take you back to marry him."
091Sm 25:41 She bowed low to the ground and responded, "I, your servant, would be happy to marry David. I would even be willing to become a slave, washing the feet of his servants!"
091Sm 25:42 Quickly getting ready, she took along five of her servant girls as attendants, mounted her donkey, and went with David's messengers. And so she became his wife.
091Sm 25:43 David also married Ahinoam from Jezreel, making both of them his wives.
091Sm 25:44 Saul, meanwhile, had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to a man from Gallim named Palti son of Laish.
091Sm 26:1 Now some men from Ziph came to Saul at Gibeah to tell him, "David is hiding on the hill of Hakilah, which overlooks Jeshimon."
091Sm 26:2 So Saul took 3,000 of Israel's elite troops and went to hunt him down in the wilderness of Ziph.
091Sm 26:3 Saul camped along the road beside the hill of Hakilah, near Jeshimon, where David was hiding. When David learned that Saul had come after him into the wilderness,
091Sm 26:4 he sent out spies to verify the report of Saul's arrival.
091Sm 26:5 David slipped over to Saul's camp one night to look around. Saul and Abner son of Ner, the commander of his army, were sleeping inside a ring formed by the slumbering warriors.
091Sm 26:6 "Who will volunteer to go in there with me?" David asked Ahimelech the Hittite and Abishai son of Zeruiah, Joab's brother. "I'll go with you," Abishai replied.
091Sm 26:7 So David and Abishai went right into Saul's camp and found him asleep, with his spear stuck in the ground beside his head. Abner and the soldiers were lying asleep around him.
091Sm 26:8 "God has surely handed your enemy over to you this time!" Abishai whispered to David. "Let me pin him to the ground with one thrust of the spear; I won't need to strike twice!"
091Sm 26:9 "No!" David said. "Don't kill him. For who can remain innocent after attacking the LORD's anointed one?
091Sm 26:10 Surely the LORD will strike Saul down someday, or he will die of old age or in battle.
091Sm 26:11 The LORD forbid that I should kill the one he has anointed! But take his spear and that jug of water beside his head, and then let's get out of here!"
091Sm 26:12 So David took the spear and jug of water that were near Saul's head. Then he and Abishai got away without anyone seeing them or even waking up, because the LORD had put Saul's men into a deep sleep.
091Sm 26:13 David climbed the hill opposite the camp until he was at a safe distance.
091Sm 26:14 Then he shouted down to the soldiers and to Abner son of Ner, "Wake up, Abner!" "Who is it?" Abner demanded.
091Sm 26:15 "Well, Abner, you're a great man, aren't you?" David taunted. "Where in all Israel is there anyone as mighty? So why haven't you guarded your master the king when someone came to kill him?
091Sm 26:16 This isn't good at all! I swear by the LORD that you and your men deserve to die, because you failed to protect your master, the LORD's anointed! Look around! Where are the king's spear and the jug of water that were beside his head?"
091Sm 26:17 Saul recognized David's voice and called out, "Is that you, my son David?" And David replied, "Yes, my lord the king.
091Sm 26:18 Why are you chasing me? What have I done? What is my crime?
091Sm 26:19 But now let my lord the king listen to his servant. If the LORD has stirred you up against me, then let him accept my offering. But if this is simply a human scheme, then may those involved be cursed by the LORD. For they have driven me from my home, so I can no longer live among the LORD's people, and they have said, 'Go, worship pagan gods.'
091Sm 26:20 Must I die on foreign soil, far from the presence of the LORD? Why has the king of Israel come out to search for a single flea? Why does he hunt me down like a partridge on the mountains?"
091Sm 26:21 Then Saul confessed, "I have sinned. Come back home, my son, and I will no longer try to harm you, for you valued my life today. I have been a fool and very, very wrong."
091Sm 26:22 "Here is your spear, O king," David replied. "Let one of your young men come over and get it.
091Sm 26:23 The LORD gives his own reward for doing good and for being loyal, and I refused to kill you even when the LORD placed you in my power, for you are the LORD's anointed one.
091Sm 26:24 Now may the LORD value my life, even as I have valued yours today. May he rescue me from all my troubles."
091Sm 26:25 And Saul said to David, "Blessings on you, my son David. You will do many heroic deeds, and you will surely succeed." Then David went away, and Saul returned home.
091Sm 27:1 But David kept thinking to himself, "Someday Saul is going to get me. The best thing I can do is escape to the Philistines. Then Saul will stop hunting for me in Israelite territory, and I will finally be safe."
091Sm 27:2 So David took his 600 men and went over and joined Achish son of Maoch, the king of Gath.
091Sm 27:3 David and his men and their families settled there with Achish at Gath. David brought his two wives along with him - Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, Nabal's widow from Carmel.
091Sm 27:4 Word soon reached Saul that David had fled to Gath, so he stopped hunting for him.
091Sm 27:5 One day David said to Achish, "If it is all right with you, we would rather live in one of the country towns instead of here in the royal city."
091Sm 27:6 So Achish gave him the town of Ziklag (which still belongs to the kings of Judah to this day),
091Sm 27:7 and they lived there among the Philistines for a year and four months.
091Sm 27:8 David and his men spent their time raiding the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites - people who had lived near Shur, toward the land of Egypt, since ancient times.
091Sm 27:9 David did not leave one person alive in the villages he attacked. He took the sheep, goats, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing before returning home to see King Achish.
091Sm 27:10 "Where did you make your raid today?" Achish would ask. And David would reply, "Against the south of Judah, the Jerahmeelites, and the Kenites."
091Sm 27:11 No one was left alive to come to Gath and tell where he had really been. This happened again and again while he was living among the Philistines.
091Sm 27:12 Achish believed David and thought to himself, "By now the people of Israel must hate him bitterly. Now he will have to stay here and serve me forever!"
091Sm 28:1 About that time the Philistines mustered their armies for another war with Israel. King Achish told David, "You and your men will be expected to join me in battle."
091Sm 28:2 "Very well!" David agreed. "Now you will see for yourself what we can do." Then Achish told David, "I will make you my personal bodyguard for life."
091Sm 28:3 Meanwhile, Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him. He was buried in Ramah, his hometown. And Saul had banned from the land of Israel all mediums and those who consult the spirits of the dead.
091Sm 28:4 The Philistines set up their camp at Shunem, and Saul gathered all the army of Israel and camped at Gilboa.
091Sm 28:5 When Saul saw the vast Philistine army, he became frantic with fear.
091Sm 28:6 He asked the LORD what he should do, but the LORD refused to answer him, either by dreams or by sacred lots¨ç or by the prophets. / ¨ç{Hebrew by Urim}
091Sm 28:7 Saul then said to his advisers, "Find a woman who is a medium, so I can go and ask her what to do." His advisers replied, "There is a medium at Endor."
091Sm 28:8 So Saul disguised himself by wearing ordinary clothing instead of his royal robes. Then he went to the woman's home at night, accompanied by two of his men. "I have to talk to a man who has died," he said. "Will you call up his spirit for me?"
091Sm 28:9 "Are you trying to get me killed?" the woman demanded. "You know that Saul has outlawed all the mediums and all who consult the spirits of the dead. Why are you setting a trap for me?"
091Sm 28:10 But Saul took an oath in the name of the LORD and promised, "As surely as the LORD lives, nothing bad will happen to you for doing this."
091Sm 28:11 Finally, the woman said, "Well, whose spirit do you want me to call up?" "Call up Samuel," Saul replied.
091Sm 28:12 When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed, "You've deceived me! You are Saul!"
091Sm 28:13 "Don't be afraid!" the king told her. "What do you see?" "I see a god¨ç coming up out of the earth," she said. / ¨ç{Or gods}
091Sm 28:14 "What does he look like?" Saul asked. "He is an old man wrapped in a robe," she replied. Saul realized it was Samuel, and he fell to the ground before him.
091Sm 28:15 "Why have you disturbed me by calling me back?" Samuel asked Saul. "Because I am in deep trouble," Saul replied. "The Philistines are at war with me, and God has left me and won't reply by prophets or dreams. So I have called for you to tell me what to do."
091Sm 28:16 But Samuel replied, "Why ask me, since the LORD has left you and has become your enemy?
091Sm 28:17 The LORD has done just as he said he would. He has torn the kingdom from you and given it to your rival, David.
091Sm 28:18 The LORD has done this to you today because you refused to carry out his fierce anger against the Amalekites.
091Sm 28:19 What's more, the LORD will hand you and the army of Israel over to the Philistines tomorrow, and you and your sons will be here with me. The LORD will bring down the entire army of Israel in defeat."
091Sm 28:20 Saul fell full length on the ground, paralyzed with fright because of Samuel's words. He was also faint with hunger, for he had eaten nothing all day and all night.
091Sm 28:21 When the woman saw how distraught he was, she said, "Sir, I obeyed your command at the risk of my life.
091Sm 28:22 Now do what I say, and let me give you a little something to eat so you can regain your strength for the trip back."
091Sm 28:23 But Saul refused to eat anything. Then his advisers joined the woman in urging him to eat, so he finally yielded and got up from the ground and sat on the couch.
091Sm 28:24 The woman had been fattening a calf, so she hurried out and killed it. She took some flour, kneaded it into dough and baked unleavened bread.
091Sm 28:25 She brought the meal to Saul and his advisers, and they ate it. Then they went out into the night.
091Sm 29:1 The entire Philistine army now mobilized at Aphek, and the Israelites camped at the spring in Jezreel.
091Sm 29:2 As the Philistine rulers were leading out their troops in groups of hundreds and thousands, David and his men marched at the rear with King Achish.
091Sm 29:3 But the Philistine commanders demanded, "What are these Hebrews doing here?" And Achish told them, "This is David, the servant of King Saul of Israel. He's been with me for years, and I've never found a single fault in him from the day he arrived until today."
091Sm 29:4 But the Philistine commanders were angry. "Send him back to the town you've given him!" they demanded. "He can't go into the battle with us. What if he turns against us in battle and becomes our adversary? Is there any better way for him to reconcile himself with his master than by handing our heads over to him?
091Sm 29:5 Isn't this the same David about whom the women of Israel sing in their dances, 'Saul has killed his thousands, and David his ten thousands'?"
091Sm 29:6 So Achish finally summoned David and said to him, "I swear by the LORD that you have been a trustworthy ally. I think you should go with me into battle, for I've never found a single flaw in you from the day you arrived until today. But the other Philistine rulers won't hear of it.
091Sm 29:7 Please don't upset them, but go back quietly."
091Sm 29:8 "What have I done to deserve this treatment?" David demanded. "What have you ever found in your servant, that I can't go and fight the enemies of my lord the king?"
091Sm 29:9 But Achish insisted, "As far as I'm concerned, you're as perfect as an angel of God. But the Philistine commanders are afraid to have you with them in the battle.
091Sm 29:10 Now get up early in the morning, and leave with your men as soon as it gets light."
091Sm 29:11 So David and his men headed back into the land of the Philistines, while the Philistine army went on to Jezreel.
091Sm 30:1 Three days later, when David and his men arrived home at their town of Ziklag, they found that the Amalekites had made a raid into the Negev and Ziklag; they had crushed Ziklag and burned it to the ground.
091Sm 30:2 They had carried off the women and children and everyone else but without killing anyone.
091Sm 30:3 When David and his men saw the ruins and realized what had happened to their families,
091Sm 30:4 they wept until they could weep no more.
091Sm 30:5 David's two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel, were among those captured.
091Sm 30:6 David was now in great danger because all his men were very bitter about losing their sons and daughters, and they began to talk of stoning him. But David found strength in the LORD his God.
091Sm 30:7 Then he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring me the ephod!" So Abiathar brought it.
091Sm 30:8 Then David asked the LORD, "Should I chase after this band of raiders? Will I catch them?" And the LORD told him, "Yes, go after them. You will surely recover everything that was taken from you!"
091Sm 30:9 So David and his 600 men set out, and they came to the brook Besor.
091Sm 30:10 But 200 of the men were too exhausted to cross the brook, so David continued the pursuit with 400 men.
091Sm 30:11 Along the way they found an Egyptian man in a field and brought him to David. They gave him some bread to eat and water to drink.
091Sm 30:12 They also gave him part of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins, for he hadn't had anything to eat or drink for three days and nights. Before long his strength returned.
091Sm 30:13 "To whom do you belong, and where do you come from?" David asked him. "I am an Egyptian - the slave of an Amalekite," he replied. "My master abandoned me three days ago because I was sick.
091Sm 30:14 We were on our way back from raiding the Kerethites in the Negev, the territory of Judah, and the land of Caleb, and we had just burned Ziklag."
091Sm 30:15 "Will you lead me to this band of raiders?" David asked. The young man replied, "If you take an oath in God's name that you will not kill me or give me back to my master, then I will guide you to them."
091Sm 30:16 So he led David to them, and they found the Amalekites spread out across the fields, eating and drinking and dancing with joy because of the vast amount of plunder they had taken from the Philistines and the land of Judah.
091Sm 30:17 David and his men rushed in among them and slaughtered them throughout that night and the entire next day until evening. None of the Amalekites escaped except 400 young men who fled on camels.
091Sm 30:18 David got back everything the Amalekites had taken, and he rescued his two wives.
091Sm 30:19 Nothing was missing£º small or great, son or daughter, nor anything else that had been taken. David brought everything back.
091Sm 30:20 He also recovered all the flocks and herds, and his men drove them ahead of the other livestock. "This plunder belongs to David!" they said.
091Sm 30:21 Then David returned to the brook Besor and met up with the 200 men who had been left behind because they were too exhausted to go with him. They went out to meet David and his men, and David greeted them joyfully.
091Sm 30:22 But some evil troublemakers among David's men said, "They didn't go with us, so they can't have any of the plunder we recovered. Give them their wives and children, and tell them to be gone."
091Sm 30:23 But David said, "No, my brothers! Don't be selfish with what the LORD has given us. He has kept us safe and helped us defeat the band of raiders that attacked us.
091Sm 30:24 Who will listen when you talk like this? We share and share alike - those who go to battle and those who guard the equipment."
091Sm 30:25 From then on David made this a decree and regulation for Israel, and it is still followed today.
091Sm 30:26 When he arrived at Ziklag, David sent part of the plunder to the elders of Judah, who were his friends. "Here is a present for you, taken from the LORD's enemies," he said.
091Sm 30:27 The gifts were sent to the people of the following towns David had visited£º Bethel, Ramoth-negev, Jattir,
091Sm 30:28 Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa,
091Sm 30:29 Racal¨ç, the towns of the Jerahmeelites, the towns of the Kenites, / ¨ç{Greek version reads Carmel}
091Sm 30:30 Hormah, Bor-ashan, Athach,
091Sm 30:31 Hebron, and all the other places David and his men had visited.
091Sm 31:1 Now the Philistines attacked Israel, and the men of Israel fled before them. Many were slaughtered on the slopes of Mount Gilboa.
091Sm 31:2 The Philistines closed in on Saul and his sons, and they killed three of his sons - Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malkishua.
091Sm 31:3 The fighting grew very fierce around Saul, and the Philistine archers caught up with him and wounded him severely.
091Sm 31:4 Saul groaned to his armor bearer, "Take your sword and kill me before these pagan Philistines come to run me through and taunt and torture me." But his armor bearer was afraid and would not do it. So Saul took his own sword and fell on it.
091Sm 31:5 When his armor bearer realized that Saul was dead, he fell on his own sword and died beside the king.
091Sm 31:6 So Saul, his three sons, his armor bearer, and his troops all died together that same day.
091Sm 31:7 When the Israelites on the other side of the Jezreel Valley and beyond the Jordan saw that the Israelite army had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their towns and fled. So the Philistines moved in and occupied their towns.
091Sm 31:8 The next day, when the Philistines went out to strip the dead, they found the bodies of Saul and his three sons on Mount Gilboa.
091Sm 31:9 So they cut off Saul's head and stripped off his armor. Then they proclaimed the good news of Saul's death in their pagan temple and to the people throughout the land of Philistia.
091Sm 31:10 They placed his armor in the temple of the Ashtoreths, and they fastened his body to the wall of the city of Beth-shan.
091Sm 31:11 But when the people of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul,
091Sm 31:12 all their mighty warriors traveled through the night to Beth-shan and took the bodies of Saul and his sons down from the wall. They brought them to Jabesh, where they burned the bodies.
091Sm 31:13 Then they took their bones and buried them beneath the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and they fasted for seven days.

102Sm 1:1 After the death of Saul, David returned from his victory over the Amalekites and spent two days in Ziklag.
102Sm 1:2 On the third day a man arrived from Saul's army camp. He had torn his clothes and put dirt on his head to show that he was in mourning. He fell to the ground before David in deep respect.
102Sm 1:3 "Where have you come from?" David asked. "I escaped from the Israelite camp," the man replied.
102Sm 1:4 "What happened?" David demanded. "Tell me how the battle went." The man replied, "Our entire army fled from the battle. Many of the men are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead."
102Sm 1:5 "How do you know Saul and Jonathan are dead?" David demanded of the young man.
102Sm 1:6 The man answered, "I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear with the enemy chariots and charioteers closing in on him.
102Sm 1:7 When he turned and saw me, he cried out for me to come to him. 'How can I help?' I asked him.
102Sm 1:8 "He responded, 'Who are you?' "'I am an Amalekite,' I told him.
102Sm 1:9 "Then he begged me, 'Come over here and put me out of my misery, for I am in terrible pain and want to die.'
102Sm 1:10 "So I killed him," the Amalekite told David, "for I knew he couldn't live. Then I took his crown and his armband, and I have brought them here to you, my lord."
102Sm 1:11 David and his men tore their clothes in sorrow when they heard the news.
102Sm 1:12 They mourned and wept and fasted all day for Saul and his son Jonathan, and for the LORD's army and the nation of Israel, because they had died by the sword that day.
102Sm 1:13 Then David said to the young man who had brought the news, "Where are you from?" And he replied, "I am a foreigner, an Amalekite, who lives in your land."
102Sm 1:14 "Why were you not afraid to kill the LORD's anointed one?" David asked.
102Sm 1:15 Then David said to one of his men, "Kill him!" So the man thrust his sword into the Amalekite and killed him.
102Sm 1:16 "You have condemned yourself," David said, "for you yourself confessed that you killed the LORD's anointed one."
102Sm 1:17 Then David composed a funeral song for Saul and Jonathan,
102Sm 1:18 and he commanded that it be taught to the people of Judah. It is known as the Song of the Bow, and it is recorded in The Book of Jashar¨ç. / ¨ç{Or The Book of the Upright}
102Sm 1:19 Your pride and joy, O Israel, lies dead on the hills! Oh, how the mighty heroes have fallen!
102Sm 1:20 Don't announce the news in Gath, don't proclaim it in the streets of Ashkelon, or the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice and the pagans will laugh in triumph.
102Sm 1:21 O mountains of Gilboa, let there be no dew or rain upon you, nor fruitful fields producing offerings of grain¨ç. For there the shield of the mighty heroes was defiled; the shield of Saul will no longer be anointed with oil. / ¨ç{The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
102Sm 1:22 The bow of Jonathan was powerful, and the sword of Saul did its mighty work. They shed the blood of their enemies and pierced the bodies of mighty heroes.
102Sm 1:23 How beloved and gracious were Saul and Jonathan! They were together in life and in death. They were swifter than eagles, stronger than lions.
102Sm 1:24 O women of Israel, weep for Saul, for he dressed you in luxurious scarlet clothing, in garments decorated with gold.
102Sm 1:25 Oh, how the mighty heroes have fallen in battle! Jonathan lies dead on the hills.
102Sm 1:26 How I weep for you, my brother Jonathan! Oh, how much I loved you! And your love for me was deep, deeper than the love of women!
102Sm 1:27 Oh, how the mighty heroes have fallen! Stripped of their weapons, they lie dead.
102Sm 2:1 After this, David asked the LORD, "Should I move back to one of the towns of Judah?" "Yes," the LORD replied. Then David asked, "Which town should I go to?" "To Hebron," the LORD answered.
102Sm 2:2 David's two wives were Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel. So David and his wives
102Sm 2:3 and his men and their families all moved to Judah, and they settled in the villages near Hebron.
102Sm 2:4 Then the men of Judah came to David and anointed him king over the people of Judah. When David heard that the men of Jabesh-gilead had buried Saul,
102Sm 2:5 he sent them this message£º "May the LORD bless you for being so loyal to your master Saul and giving him a decent burial.
102Sm 2:6 May the LORD be loyal to you in return and reward you with his unfailing love! And I, too, will reward you for what you have done.
102Sm 2:7 Now that Saul is dead, I ask you to be my strong and loyal subjects like the people of Judah, who have anointed me as their new king."
102Sm 2:8 But Abner son of Ner, the commander of Saul's army, had already gone to Mahanaim with Saul's son Ishbosheth¨ç. / ¨ç{Ishbosheth is another name for Esh-baal}
102Sm 2:9 There he proclaimed Ishbosheth king over Gilead, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, the land of the Ashurites, and all the rest of Israel.
102Sm 2:10 Ishbosheth, Saul's son, was forty years old when he became king, and he ruled from Mahanaim for two years. Meanwhile, the people of Judah remained loyal to David.
102Sm 2:11 David made Hebron his capital, and he ruled as king of Judah for seven and a half years.
102Sm 2:12 One day Abner led Ishbosheth's troops from Mahanaim to Gibeon.
102Sm 2:13 About the same time, Joab son of Zeruiah led David's troops out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. The two groups sat down there, facing each other from opposite sides of the pool.
102Sm 2:14 Then Abner suggested to Joab, "Let's have a few of our warriors fight hand to hand here in front of us." "All right," Joab agreed.
102Sm 2:15 So twelve men were chosen to fight from each side - twelve men of Benjamin representing Ishbosheth son of Saul, and twelve representing David.
102Sm 2:16 Each one grabbed his opponent by the hair and thrust his sword into the other's side so that all of them died. So this place at Gibeon has been known ever since as the Field of Swords¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew Helkath-hazzurim}
102Sm 2:17 A fierce battle followed that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were defeated by the forces of David.
102Sm 2:18 Joab, Abishai, and Asahel - the three sons of Zeruiah - were among David's forces that day. Asahel could run like a gazelle,
102Sm 2:19 and he began chasing Abner. He pursued him relentlessly, not stopping for anything.
102Sm 2:20 When Abner looked back and saw him coming, he called out, "Is that you, Asahel?" "Yes, it is," he replied.
102Sm 2:21 "Go fight someone else!" Abner warned. "Take on one of the younger men, and strip him of his weapons." But Asahel kept right on chasing Abner.
102Sm 2:22 Again Abner shouted to him, "Get away from here! I don't want to kill you. How could I ever face your brother Joab again?"
102Sm 2:23 But Asahel refused to turn back, so Abner thrust the butt end of his spear through Asahel's stomach, and the spear came out through his back. He stumbled to the ground and died there. And everyone who came by that spot stopped and stood still when they saw Asahel lying there.
102Sm 2:24 When Joab and Abishai found out what had happened, they set out after Abner. The sun was just going down as they arrived at the hill of Ammah near Giah, along the road to the wilderness of Gibeon.
102Sm 2:25 Abner's troops from the tribe of Benjamin regrouped there at the top of the hill to take a stand.
102Sm 2:26 Abner shouted down to Joab, "Must we always be killing each other? Don't you realize that bitterness is the only result? When will you call off your men from chasing their Israelite brothers?"
102Sm 2:27 Then Joab said, "God only knows what would have happened if you hadn't spoken, for we would have chased you all night if necessary."
102Sm 2:28 So Joab blew the ram's horn, and his men stopped chasing the troops of Israel.
102Sm 2:29 All that night Abner and his men retreated through the Jordan Valley¨ç. They crossed the Jordan River, traveling all through the morning¨è, and didn't stop until they arrived at Mahanaim. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Arabah} ¨è{Or continued on through the Bithron. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
102Sm 2:30 Meanwhile, Joab and his men also returned home. When Joab counted his casualties, he discovered that only 19 men were missing in addition to Asahel.
102Sm 2:31 But 360 of Abner's men had been killed, all from the tribe of Benjamin.
102Sm 2:32 Joab and his men took Asahel's body to Bethlehem and buried him there in his father's tomb. Then they traveled all night and reached Hebron at daybreak.
102Sm 3:1 That was the beginning of a long war between those who were loyal to Saul and those loyal to David. As time passed David became stronger and stronger, while Saul's dynasty became weaker and weaker.
102Sm 3:2 These are the sons who were born to David in Hebron£º The oldest was Amnon, whose mother was Ahinoam from Jezreel.
102Sm 3:3 The second was Daniel¨ç, whose mother was Abigail, the widow of Nabal from Carmel. The third was Absalom, whose mother was Maacah, the daughter of Talmai, king of Geshur. / ¨ç{As in parallel text at 1 Chr 3.1 (see also Greek version, which reads Daluia, and Dead Sea Scrolls, which read Dan[iel]); Hebrew reads Kileab}
102Sm 3:4 The fourth was Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith. The fifth was Shephatiah, whose mother was Abital.
102Sm 3:5 The sixth was Ithream, whose mother was Eglah, David's wife. These sons were all born to David in Hebron.
102Sm 3:6 As the war between the house of Saul and the house of David went on, Abner became a powerful leader among those loyal to Saul.
102Sm 3:7 One day Ishbosheth¨ç, Saul's son, accused Abner of sleeping with one of his father's concubines, a woman named Rizpah, daughter of Aiah. / ¨ç{Ishbosheth is another name for Esh-baal}
102Sm 3:8 Abner was furious. "Am I some Judean dog to be kicked around like this?" he shouted. "After all I have done for your father, Saul, and his family and friends by not handing you over to David, is this my reward - that you find fault with me about this woman?
102Sm 3:9 May God strike me and even kill me if I don't do everything I can to help David get what the LORD has promised him!
102Sm 3:10 I'm going to take Saul's kingdom and give it to David. I will establish the throne of David over Israel as well as Judah, all the way from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south."
102Sm 3:11 Ishbosheth didn't dare say another word because he was afraid of what Abner might do.
102Sm 3:12 Then Abner sent messengers to David, saying, "Doesn't the entire land belong to you? Make a solemn pact with me, and I will help turn over all of Israel to you."
102Sm 3:13 "All right," David replied, "but I will not negotiate with you unless you bring back my wife Michal, Saul's daughter, when you come."
102Sm 3:14 David then sent this message to Ishbosheth, Saul's son£º "Give me back my wife Michal, for I bought her with the lives¨ç of 100 Philistines." / ¨ç{Hebrew the foreskins}
102Sm 3:15 So Ishbosheth took Michal away from her husband, Palti¨ç son of Laish. / ¨ç{As in 1 Sam 25.44; Hebrew reads Paltiel, a variant spelling of Palti}
102Sm 3:16 Palti followed along behind her as far as Bahurim, weeping as he went. Then Abner told him, "Go back home!" So Palti returned.
102Sm 3:17 Meanwhile, Abner had consulted with the elders of Israel. "For some time now," he told them, "you have wanted to make David your king.
102Sm 3:18 Now is the time! For the LORD has said, 'I have chosen David to save my people Israel from the hands of the Philistines and from all their other enemies.'"
102Sm 3:19 Abner also spoke with the men of Benjamin. Then he went to Hebron to tell David that all the people of Israel and Benjamin had agreed to support him.
102Sm 3:20 When Abner and twenty of his men came to Hebron, David entertained them with a great feast.
102Sm 3:21 Then Abner said to David, "Let me go and call an assembly of all Israel to support my lord the king. They will make a covenant with you to make you their king, and you will rule over everything your heart desires." So David sent Abner safely on his way.
102Sm 3:22 But just after David had sent Abner away in safety, Joab and some of David's troops returned from a raid, bringing much plunder with them.
102Sm 3:23 When Joab arrived, he was told that Abner had just been there visiting the king and had been sent away in safety.
102Sm 3:24 Joab rushed to the king and demanded, "What have you done? What do you mean by letting Abner get away?
102Sm 3:25 You know perfectly well that he came to spy on you and find out everything you're doing!"
102Sm 3:26 Joab then left David and sent messengers to catch up with Abner, asking him to return. They found him at the well of Sirah and brought him back, though David knew nothing about it.
102Sm 3:27 When Abner arrived back at Hebron, Joab took him aside at the gateway as if to speak with him privately. But then he stabbed Abner in the stomach and killed him in revenge for killing his brother Asahel.
102Sm 3:28 When David heard about it, he declared, "I vow by the LORD that I and my kingdom are forever innocent of this crime against Abner son of Ner.
102Sm 3:29 Joab and his family are the guilty ones. May the family of Joab be cursed in every generation with a man who has open sores or leprosy¨ç or who walks on crutches¨è or dies by the sword or begs for food!" / ¨ç{Or or a contagious skin disease. The Hebrew word used here can describe various skin diseases} ¨è{Or who is effeminate; Hebrew reads who handles a spindle}
102Sm 3:30 So Joab and his brother Abishai killed Abner because Abner had killed their brother Asahel at the battle of Gibeon.
102Sm 3:31 Then David said to Joab and all those who were with him, "Tear your clothes and put on burlap. Mourn for Abner." And King David himself walked behind the procession to the grave.
102Sm 3:32 They buried Abner in Hebron, and the king and all the people wept at his graveside.
102Sm 3:33 Then the king sang this funeral song for Abner£º "Should Abner have died as fools die?
102Sm 3:34 Your hands were not bound; your feet were not chained. No, you were murdered - the victim of a wicked plot." All the people wept again for Abner.
102Sm 3:35 David had refused to eat anything on the day of the funeral, and now everyone begged him to eat. But David had made a vow, saying, "May God strike me and even kill me if I eat anything before sundown."
102Sm 3:36 This pleased the people very much. In fact, everything the king did pleased them!
102Sm 3:37 So everyone in Judah and all Israel understood that David was not responsible for Abner's murder.
102Sm 3:38 Then King David said to his officials, "Don't you realize that a great commander has fallen today in Israel?
102Sm 3:39 And even though I am the anointed king, these two sons of Zeruiah - Joab and Abishai - are too strong for me to control. So may the LORD repay these evil men for their evil deeds."
102Sm 4:1 When Ishbosheth¨ç, Saul's son, heard about Abner's death at Hebron, he lost all courage, and all Israel became paralyzed with fear. / ¨ç{Ishbosheth is another name for Esh-baal}
102Sm 4:2 Now there were two brothers, Baanah and Recab, who were captains of Ishbosheth's raiding parties. They were sons of Rimmon, a member of the tribe of Benjamin who lived in Beeroth. The town of Beeroth is now part of Benjamin's territory
102Sm 4:3 because the original people of Beeroth fled to Gittaim, where they still live as foreigners.
102Sm 4:4 (Saul's son Jonathan had a son named Mephibosheth¨ç, who was crippled as a child. He was five years old when the report came from Jezreel that Saul and Jonathan had been killed in battle. When the child's nurse heard the news, she picked him up and fled. But as she hurried away, she dropped him, and he became crippled.) / ¨ç{Mephibosheth is another name for Merib-baal}
102Sm 4:5 One day Recab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon from Beeroth, went to Ishbosheth's house around noon as he was taking his midday rest.
102Sm 4:6 The doorkeeper, who had been sifting wheat, became drowsy and fell asleep. So Recab and Baanah slipped past her¨ç. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads So they went into the house pretending to fetch wheat, but they stabbed him in the stomach. Then Recab and Baanah escaped}
102Sm 4:7 They went into the house and found Ishbosheth sleeping on his bed. They struck and killed him and cut off his head. Then, taking his head with them, they fled across the Jordan Valley¨ç through the night. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Arabah}
102Sm 4:8 When they arrived at Hebron, they presented Ishbosheth's head to David. "Look!" they exclaimed to the king. "Here is the head of Ishbosheth, the son of your enemy Saul who tried to kill you. Today the LORD has given my lord the king revenge on Saul and his entire family!"
102Sm 4:9 But David said to Recab and Baanah, "The LORD, who saves me from all my enemies, is my witness.
102Sm 4:10 Someone once told me, 'Saul is dead,' thinking he was bringing me good news. But I seized him and killed him at Ziklag. That's the reward I gave him for his news!
102Sm 4:11 How much more should I reward evil men who have killed an innocent man in his own house and on his own bed? Shouldn't I hold you responsible for his blood and rid the earth of you?"
102Sm 4:12 So David ordered his young men to kill them, and they did. They cut off their hands and feet and hung their bodies beside the pool in Hebron. Then they took Ishbosheth's head and buried it in Abner's tomb in Hebron.
102Sm 5:1 Then all the tribes of Israel went to David at Hebron and told him, "We are your own flesh and blood.
102Sm 5:2 In the past¨ç, when Saul was our king, you were the one who really led the forces of Israel. And the LORD told you, 'You will be the shepherd of my people Israel. You will be Israel's leader.'" / ¨ç{Or For some time}
102Sm 5:3 So there at Hebron, King David made a covenant before the LORD with all the elders of Israel. And they anointed him king of Israel.
102Sm 5:4 David was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty years in all.
102Sm 5:5 He had reigned over Judah from Hebron for seven years and six months, and from Jerusalem he reigned over all Israel and Judah for thirty-three years.
102Sm 5:6 David then led his men to Jerusalem to fight against the Jebusites, the original inhabitants of the land who were living there. The Jebusites taunted David, saying, "You'll never get in here! Even the blind and lame could keep you out!" For the Jebusites thought they were safe.
102Sm 5:7 But David captured the fortress of Zion, which is now called the City of David.
102Sm 5:8 On the day of the attack, David said to his troops, "I hate those 'lame' and 'blind' Jebusites¨ç. Whoever attacks them should strike by going into the city through the water tunnel¨è." That is the origin of the saying, "The blind and the lame may not enter the house."¨é / ¨ç{Or Those 'lame' and 'blind' Jebusites hate me} ¨è{Or with scaling hooks. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain} ¨é{The meaning of this saying is uncertain}
102Sm 5:9 So David made the fortress his home, and he called it the City of David. He extended the city, starting at the supporting terraces¨ç and working inward. / ¨ç{Hebrew the millo. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
102Sm 5:10 And David became more and more powerful, because the LORD God of Heaven's Armies was with him.
102Sm 5:11 Then King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber and carpenters and stonemasons, and they built David a palace.
102Sm 5:12 And David realized that the LORD had confirmed him as king over Israel and had blessed his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
102Sm 5:13 After moving from Hebron to Jerusalem, David married more concubines and wives, and they had more sons and daughters.
102Sm 5:14 These are the names of David's sons who were born in Jerusalem£º Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon,
102Sm 5:15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia,
102Sm 5:16 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
102Sm 5:17 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king of Israel, they mobilized all their forces to capture him. But David was told they were coming, so he went into the stronghold.
102Sm 5:18 The Philistines arrived and spread out across the valley of Rephaim.
102Sm 5:19 So David asked the LORD, "Should I go out to fight the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The LORD replied to David, "Yes, go ahead. I will certainly hand them over to you."
102Sm 5:20 So David went to Baal-perazim and defeated the Philistines there. "The LORD did it!" David exclaimed. "He burst through my enemies like a raging flood!" So he named that place Baal-perazim (which means "the Lord who bursts through").
102Sm 5:21 The Philistines had abandoned their idols there, so David and his men confiscated them.
102Sm 5:22 But after a while the Philistines returned and again spread out across the valley of Rephaim.
102Sm 5:23 And again David asked the LORD what to do. "Do not attack them straight on," the LORD replied. "Instead, circle around behind and attack them near the poplar¨ç trees. / ¨ç{Or aspen, or balsam; also in 5.24. The exact identification of this tree is uncertain}
102Sm 5:24 When you hear a sound like marching feet in the tops of the poplar trees, be on the alert! That will be the signal that the LORD is moving ahead of you to strike down the Philistine army."
102Sm 5:25 So David did what the LORD commanded, and he struck down the Philistines all the way from Gibeon¨ç to Gezer. / ¨ç{As in Greek version (see also 1 Chr 14.16); Hebrew reads Geba}
102Sm 6:1 Then David again gathered all the elite troops in Israel, 30,000 in all.
102Sm 6:2 He led them to Baalah of Judah¨ç to bring back the Ark of God, which bears the name of the LORD of Heaven's Armies¨è, who is enthroned between the cherubim. / ¨ç{Baalah of Judah is another name for Kiriath-jearim; compare 1 Chr 13.6} ¨è{Or the Ark of God where the Name is proclaimed - the name of the LORD of Heaven's Armies}
102Sm 6:3 They placed the Ark of God on a new cart and brought it from Abinadab's house, which was on a hill. Uzzah and Ahio, Abinadab's sons, were guiding the cart as it left the house,
102Sm 6:4 carrying the Ark of God. Ahio walked in front of the Ark.
102Sm 6:5 David and all the people of Israel were celebrating before the LORD, singing songs¨ç and playing all kinds of musical instruments - lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals. / ¨ç{As in Dead Sea Srolls and Greek version (see also 1 Chr 13.8); Masoretic Text reads before the LORD with all manner of cypress wood}
102Sm 6:6 But when they arrived at the threshing floor of Nacon, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out his hand and steadied the Ark of God.
102Sm 6:7 Then the LORD's anger was aroused against Uzzah, and God struck him dead because of this¨ç. So Uzzah died right there beside the Ark of God. / ¨ç{As in Dead Sea Scrolls; Masoretic Text reads because of his irreverence}
102Sm 6:8 David was angry because the LORD's anger had burst out against Uzzah. He named that place Perez-uzzah (which means "to burst out against Uzzah"), as it is still called today.
102Sm 6:9 David was now afraid of the LORD, and he asked, "How can I ever bring the Ark of the LORD back into my care?"
102Sm 6:10 So David decided not to move the Ark of the LORD into the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-edom of Gath.
102Sm 6:11 The Ark of the LORD remained there in Obed-edom's house for three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and his entire household.
102Sm 6:12 Then King David was told, "The LORD has blessed Obed-edom's household and everything he has because of the Ark of God." So David went there and brought the Ark of God from the house of Obed-edom to the City of David with a great celebration.
102Sm 6:13 After the men who were carrying the Ark of the LORD had gone six steps, David sacrificed a bull and a fattened calf.
102Sm 6:14 And David danced before the LORD with all his might, wearing a priestly garment¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew a linen ephod}
102Sm 6:15 So David and all the people of Israel brought up the Ark of the LORD with shouts of joy and the blowing of rams' horns.
102Sm 6:16 But as the Ark of the LORD entered the City of David, Michal, the daughter of Saul, looked down from her window. When she saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD, she was filled with contempt for him.
102Sm 6:17 They brought the Ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the special tent David had prepared for it. And David sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings to the LORD.
102Sm 6:18 When he had finished his sacrifices, David blessed the people in the name of the LORD of Heaven's Armies.
102Sm 6:19 Then he gave to every Israelite man and woman in the crowd a loaf of bread, a cake of dates¨ç, and a cake of raisins. Then all the people returned to their homes. / ¨ç{Or a portion of meat. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
102Sm 6:20 When David returned home to bless his own family, Michal, the daughter of Saul, came out to meet him. She said in disgust, "How distinguished the king of Israel looked today, shamelessly exposing himself to the servant girls like any vulgar person might do!"
102Sm 6:21 David retorted to Michal, "I was dancing before the LORD, who chose me above your father and all his family! He appointed me as the leader of Israel, the people of the LORD, so I celebrate before the LORD.
102Sm 6:22 Yes, and I am willing to look even more foolish than this, even to be humiliated in my own eyes! But those servant girls you mentioned will indeed think I am distinguished!"
102Sm 6:23 So Michal, the daughter of Saul, remained childless throughout her entire life.
102Sm 7:1 When King David was settled in his palace and the LORD had given him rest from all the surrounding enemies,
102Sm 7:2 the king summoned Nathan the prophet. "Look," David said, "I am living in a beautiful cedar palace¨ç, but the Ark of God is out there in a tent!" / ¨ç{Hebrew a house of cedar}
102Sm 7:3 Nathan replied to the king, "Go ahead and do whatever you have in mind, for the LORD is with you."
102Sm 7:4 But that same night the LORD said to Nathan,
102Sm 7:5 "Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD has declared£º Are you the one to build a house for me to live in?
102Sm 7:6 I have never lived in a house, from the day I brought the Israelites out of Egypt until this very day. I have always moved from one place to another with a tent and a Tabernacle as my dwelling.
102Sm 7:7 Yet no matter where I have gone with the Israelites, I have never once complained to Israel's tribal leaders, the shepherds of my people Israel. I have never asked them, "Why haven't you built me a beautiful cedar house?"'
102Sm 7:8 "Now go and say to my servant David, 'This is what the LORD of Heaven's Armies has declared£º I took you from tending sheep in the pasture and selected you to be the leader of my people Israel.
102Sm 7:9 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before your eyes. Now I will make your name as famous as anyone who has ever lived on the earth!
102Sm 7:10 And I will provide a homeland for my people Israel, planting them in a secure place where they will never be disturbed. Evil nations won't oppress them as they've done in the past,
102Sm 7:11 starting from the time I appointed judges to rule my people Israel. And I will give you rest from all your enemies."'Furthermore, the LORD declares that he will make a house for you - a dynasty of kings!
102Sm 7:12 For when you die and are buried with your ancestors, I will raise up one of your descendants, your own offspring, and I will make his kingdom strong.
102Sm 7:13 He is the one who will build a house - a temple - for my name. And I will secure his royal throne forever.
102Sm 7:14 I will be his father, and he will be my son. If he sins, I will correct and discipline him with the rod, like any father would do.
102Sm 7:15 But my favor will not be taken from him as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from your sight.
102Sm 7:16 Your house and your kingdom will continue before me¨ç for all time, and your throne will be secure forever.'" / ¨ç{As in Greek version and some Hebrew manuscripts; Masoretic Text reads before you}
102Sm 7:17 So Nathan went back to David and told him everything the LORD had said in this vision.
102Sm 7:18 Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and prayed, "Who am I, O Sovereign LORD, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?
102Sm 7:19 And now, Sovereign LORD, in addition to everything else, you speak of giving your servant a lasting dynasty! Do you deal with everyone this way, O Sovereign LORD?¨ç / ¨ç{Or This is your instruction for all humanity, O Sovereign LORD}
102Sm 7:20 "What more can I say to you? You know what your servant is really like, Sovereign LORD.
102Sm 7:21 Because of your promise and according to your will, you have done all these great things and have made them known to your servant.
102Sm 7:22 "How great you are, O Sovereign LORD! There is no one like you. We have never even heard of another God like you!
102Sm 7:23 What other nation on earth is like your people Israel? What other nation, O God, have you redeemed from slavery to be your own people? You made a great name for yourself when you redeemed your people from Egypt. You performed awesome miracles and drove out the nations and gods that stood in their way¨ç. / ¨ç{As in Greek version (see also 1 Chr 17.21); Hebrew reads You made a great name for yourself and performed awesome miracles for your land. You did this in the sight of your people, whom you redeemed from Egypt, from nations and their gods}
102Sm 7:24 You made Israel your very own people forever, and you, O LORD, became their God.
102Sm 7:25 "And now, O LORD God, I am your servant; do as you have promised concerning me and my family. Confirm it as a promise that will last forever.
102Sm 7:26 And may your name be honored forever so that everyone will say, 'The LORD of Heaven's Armies is God over Israel!' And may the house of your servant David continue before you forever.
102Sm 7:27 "O LORD of Heaven's Armies, God of Israel, I have been bold enough to pray this prayer to you because you have revealed all this to your servant, saying, 'I will build a house for you - a dynasty of kings!'
102Sm 7:28 For you are God, O Sovereign LORD. Your words are truth, and you have promised these good things to your servant.
102Sm 7:29 And now, may it please you to bless the house of your servant, so that it may continue forever before you. For you have spoken, and when you grant a blessing to your servant, O Sovereign LORD, it is an eternal blessing!"
102Sm 8:1 After this, David defeated and subdued the Philistines by conquering Gath, their largest town¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew by conquering Metheg-ammah, a name that means "the bridle," possibly referring to the size of the town or the tribute money taken from it. Compare 1 Chr 18.1}
102Sm 8:2 David also conquered the land of Moab. He made the people lie down on the ground in a row, and he measured them off in groups with a length of rope. He measured off two groups to be executed for every one group to be spared. The Moabites who were spared became David's subjects and paid him tribute money.
102Sm 8:3 David also destroyed the forces of Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah, when Hadadezer marched out to strengthen his control along the Euphrates River.
102Sm 8:4 David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 charioteers¨ç, and 20,000 foot soldiers. He crippled all the chariot horses except enough for 100 chariots. / ¨ç{As in Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version (see also 1 Chr 18.4); Masoretic Text reads captured 1,700 charioteers}
102Sm 8:5 When Arameans from Damascus arrived to help King Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 of them.
102Sm 8:6 Then he placed several army garrisons in Damascus, the Aramean capital, and the Arameans became David's subjects and paid him tribute money. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
102Sm 8:7 David brought the gold shields of Hadadezer's officers to Jerusalem,
102Sm 8:8 along with a large amount of bronze from Hadadezer's towns of Tebah¨ç and Berothai. / ¨ç{As in some Greek manuscripts (see also 1 Chr 18.8); Hebrew reads Betah}
102Sm 8:9 When King Toi of Hamath heard that David had destroyed the entire army of Hadadezer,
102Sm 8:10 he sent his son Joram to congratulate King David for his successful campaign. Hadadezer and Toi had been enemies and were often at war. Joram presented David with many gifts of silver, gold, and bronze.
102Sm 8:11 King David dedicated all these gifts to the LORD, as he did with the silver and gold from the other nations he had defeated - 
102Sm 8:12 from Edom¨ç, Moab, Ammon, Philistia, and Amalek - and from Hadadezer son of Rehob, king of Zobah. / ¨ç{As in a few Hebrew manuscripts and Greek and Syriac versions (see also 8.14; 1 Chr 18.11); most Hebrew manuscripts read Aram}
102Sm 8:13 So David became even more famous when he returned from destroying 18,000 Edomites¨ç in the Valley of Salt. / ¨ç{As in a few Hebrew manuscripts and Greek and Syriac versions (see also 8.14; 1 Chr 18.12); most Hebrew manuscripts read Arameans}
102Sm 8:14 He placed army garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites became David's subjects. In fact, the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
102Sm 8:15 So David reigned over all Israel and did what was just and right for all his people.
102Sm 8:16 Joab son of Zeruiah was commander of the army. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the royal historian.
102Sm 8:17 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech son of Abiathar were the priests. Seraiah was the court secretary.
102Sm 8:18 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of the king's bodyguard¨ç. And David's sons served as priestly leaders¨è. / ¨ç{Hebrew of the Kerethites and Pelethites} ¨è{Hebrew David's sons were priests; compare parallel text at 1 Chr 18.17}
102Sm 9:1 One day David asked, "Is anyone in Saul's family still alive - anyone to whom I can show kindness for Jonathan's sake?"
102Sm 9:2 He summoned a man named Ziba, who had been one of Saul's servants. "Are you Ziba?" the king asked."Yes sir, I am," Ziba replied.
102Sm 9:3 The king then asked him, "Is anyone still alive from Saul's family? If so, I want to show God's kindness to them." Ziba replied, "Yes, one of Jonathan's sons is still alive. He is crippled in both feet."
102Sm 9:4 "Where is he?" the king asked."In Lo-debar," Ziba told him, "at the home of Makir son of Ammiel."
102Sm 9:5 So David sent for him and brought him from Makir's home.
102Sm 9:6 His name was Mephibosheth¨ç; he was Jonathan's son and Saul's grandson. When he came to David, he bowed low to the ground in deep respect. David said, "Greetings, Mephibosheth." Mephibosheth replied, "I am your servant." / ¨ç{Mephibosheth is another name for Merib-baal}
102Sm 9:7 "Don't be afraid!" David said. "I intend to show kindness to you because of my promise to your father, Jonathan. I will give you all the property that once belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you will eat here with me at the king's table!"
102Sm 9:8 Mephibosheth bowed respectfully and exclaimed, "Who is your servant, that you should show such kindness to a dead dog like me?"
102Sm 9:9 Then the king summoned Saul's servant Ziba and said, "I have given your master's grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family.
102Sm 9:10 You and your sons and servants are to farm the land for him to produce food for your master's household¨ç. But Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, will eat here at my table." (Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants.) / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads your master's grandson}
102Sm 9:11 Ziba replied, "Yes, my lord the king; I am your servant, and I will do all that you have commanded." And from that time on, Mephibosheth ate regularly at David's table¨ç, like one of the king's own sons. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads my table}
102Sm 9:12 Mephibosheth had a young son named Mica. From then on, all the members of Ziba's household were Mephibosheth's servants.
102Sm 9:13 And Mephibosheth, who was crippled in both feet, lived in Jerusalem and ate regularly at the king's table.
102Sm 10:1 Some time after this, King Nahash¨ç of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun became king. / ¨ç{As in parallel text at 1 Chr 19.1; Hebrew reads the king}
102Sm 10:2 David said, "I am going to show loyalty to Hanun just as his father, Nahash, was always loyal to me." So David sent ambassadors to express sympathy to Hanun about his father's death.But when David's ambassadors arrived in the land of Ammon,
102Sm 10:3 the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, their master, "Do you really think these men are coming here to honor your father? No! David has sent them to spy out the city so they can come in and conquer it!"
102Sm 10:4 So Hanun seized David's ambassadors and shaved off half of each man's beard, cut off their robes at the buttocks, and sent them back to David in shame.
102Sm 10:5 When David heard what had happened, he sent messengers to tell the men, "Stay at Jericho until your beards grow out, and then come back." For they felt deep shame because of their appearance.
102Sm 10:6 When the people of Ammon realized how seriously they had angered David, they sent and hired 20,000 Aramean foot soldiers from the lands of Beth-rehob and Zobah, 1,000 from the king of Maacah, and 12,000 from the land of Tob.
102Sm 10:7 When David heard about this, he sent Joab and all his warriors to fight them.
102Sm 10:8 The Ammonite troops came out and drew up their battle lines at the entrance of the city gate, while the Arameans from Zobah and Rehob and the men from Tob and Maacah positioned themselves to fight in the open fields.
102Sm 10:9 When Joab saw that he would have to fight on both the front and the rear, he chose some of Israel's elite troops and placed them under his personal command to fight the Arameans in the fields.
102Sm 10:10 He left the rest of the army under the command of his brother Abishai, who was to attack the Ammonites.
102Sm 10:11 "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then come over and help me," Joab told his brother. "And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will come and help you.
102Sm 10:12 Be courageous! Let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. May the LORD's will be done."
102Sm 10:13 When Joab and his troops attacked, the Arameans began to run away.
102Sm 10:14 And when the Ammonites saw the Arameans running, they ran from Abishai and retreated into the city. After the battle was over, Joab returned to Jerusalem.
102Sm 10:15 The Arameans now realized that they were no match for Israel. So when they regrouped,
102Sm 10:16 they were joined by additional Aramean troops summoned by Hadadezer from the other side of the Euphrates River¨ç. These troops arrived at Helam under the command of Shobach, the commander of Hadadezer's forces. / ¨ç{Hebrew the river}
102Sm 10:17 When David heard what was happening, he mobilized all Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and led the army to Helam. The Arameans positioned themselves in battle formation and fought against David.
102Sm 10:18 But again the Arameans fled from the Israelites. This time David's forces killed 700 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers¨ç, including Shobach, the commander of their army. / ¨ç{As in some Greek manuscripts (see also 1 Chr 19.18); Hebrew reads charioteers}
102Sm 10:19 When all the kings allied with Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they surrendered to Israel and became their subjects. After that, the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites.
102Sm 11:1 In the spring of the year¨ç, when kings normally go out to war, David sent Joab and the Israelite army to fight the Ammonites. They destroyed the Ammonite army and laid siege to the city of Rabbah. However, David stayed behind in Jerusalem. / ¨ç{Hebrew At the turn of the year. The first day of the year in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in March or April}
102Sm 11:2 Late one afternoon, after his midday rest, David got out of bed and was walking on the roof of the palace. As he looked out over the city, he noticed a woman of unusual beauty taking a bath.
102Sm 11:3 He sent someone to find out who she was, and he was told, "She is Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam and the wife of Uriah the Hittite."
102Sm 11:4 Then David sent messengers to get her; and when she came to the palace, he slept with her. She had just completed the purification rites after having her menstrual period. Then she returned home.
102Sm 11:5 Later, when Bathsheba discovered that she was pregnant, she sent David a message, saying, "I'm pregnant."
102Sm 11:6 Then David sent word to Joab£º "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent him to David.
102Sm 11:7 When Uriah arrived, David asked him how Joab and the army were getting along and how the war was progressing.
102Sm 11:8 Then he told Uriah, "Go on home and relax¨ç." David even sent a gift to Uriah after he had left the palace. / ¨ç{Hebrew and wash your feet, an expression that may also have a connotation of ritualistic washing}
102Sm 11:9 But Uriah didn't go home. He slept that night at the palace entrance with the king's palace guard.
102Sm 11:10 When David heard that Uriah had not gone home, he summoned him and asked, "What's the matter? Why didn't you go home last night after being away for so long?"
102Sm 11:11 Uriah replied, "The Ark and the armies of Israel and Judah are living in tents¨ç, and Joab and my master's men are camping in the open fields. How could I go home to wine and dine and sleep with my wife? I swear that I would never do such a thing." / ¨ç{Or at Succoth}
102Sm 11:12 "Well, stay here today," David told him, "and tomorrow you may return to the army." So Uriah stayed in Jerusalem that day and the next.
102Sm 11:13 Then David invited him to dinner and got him drunk. But even then he couldn't get Uriah to go home to his wife. Again he slept at the palace entrance with the king's palace guard.
102Sm 11:14 So the next morning David wrote a letter to Joab and gave it to Uriah to deliver.
102Sm 11:15 The letter instructed Joab, "Station Uriah on the front lines where the battle is fiercest. Then pull back so that he will be killed."
102Sm 11:16 So Joab assigned Uriah to a spot close to the city wall where he knew the enemy's strongest men were fighting.
102Sm 11:17 And when the enemy soldiers came out of the city to fight, Uriah the Hittite was killed along with several other Israelite soldiers.
102Sm 11:18 Then Joab sent a battle report to David.
102Sm 11:19 He told his messenger, "Report all the news of the battle to the king.
102Sm 11:20 But he might get angry and ask, 'Why did the troops go so close to the city? Didn't they know there would be shooting from the walls?
102Sm 11:21 Wasn't Abimelech son of Gideon¨ç killed at Thebez by a woman who threw a millstone down on him from the wall? Why would you get so close to the wall?' Then tell him, 'Uriah the Hittite was killed, too.'" / ¨ç{Hebrew son of Jerub-besheth. Jerub-besheth is a variation on the name Jerub-baal, which is another name for Gideon; see Judg 6.32}
102Sm 11:22 So the messenger went to Jerusalem and gave a complete report to David.
102Sm 11:23 "The enemy came out against us in the open fields," he said. "And as we chased them back to the city gate,
102Sm 11:24 the archers on the wall shot arrows at us. Some of the king's men were killed, including Uriah the Hittite."
102Sm 11:25 "Well, tell Joab not to be discouraged," David said. "The sword devours this one today and that one tomorrow! Fight harder next time, and conquer the city!"
102Sm 11:26 When Uriah's wife heard that her husband was dead, she mourned for him.
102Sm 11:27 When the period of mourning was over, David sent for her and brought her to the palace, and she became one of his wives. Then she gave birth to a son. But the LORD was displeased with what David had done.
102Sm 12:1 So the LORD sent Nathan the prophet to tell David this story£º "There were two men in a certain town. One was rich, and one was poor.
102Sm 12:2 The rich man owned a great many sheep and cattle.
102Sm 12:3 The poor man owned nothing but one little lamb he had bought. He raised that little lamb, and it grew up with his children. It ate from the man's own plate and drank from his cup. He cuddled it in his arms like a baby daughter.
102Sm 12:4 One day a guest arrived at the home of the rich man. But instead of killing an animal from his own flock or herd, he took the poor man's lamb and killed it and prepared it for his guest."
102Sm 12:5 David was furious. "As surely as the LORD lives," he vowed, "any man who would do such a thing deserves to die!
102Sm 12:6 He must repay four lambs to the poor man for the one he stole and for having no pity."
102Sm 12:7 Then Nathan said to David, "You are that man! The LORD, the God of Israel, says£º I anointed you king of Israel and saved you from the power of Saul.
102Sm 12:8 I gave you your master's house and his wives and the kingdoms of Israel and Judah. And if that had not been enough, I would have given you much, much more.
102Sm 12:9 Why, then, have you despised the word of the LORD and done this horrible deed? For you have murdered Uriah the Hittite with the sword of the Ammonites and stolen his wife.
102Sm 12:10 From this time on, your family will live by the sword because you have despised me by taking Uriah's wife to be your own.
102Sm 12:11 "This is what the LORD says£º Because of what you have done, I will cause your own household to rebel against you. I will give your wives to another man before your very eyes, and he will go to bed with them in public view.
102Sm 12:12 You did it secretly, but I will make this happen to you openly in the sight of all Israel."
102Sm 12:13 Then David confessed to Nathan, "I have sinned against the LORD." Nathan replied, "Yes, but the LORD has forgiven you, and you won't die for this sin.
102Sm 12:14 Nevertheless, because you have shown utter contempt for the LORD¨ç by doing this, your child will die." / ¨ç{As in Dead Sea Scrolls; Masoretic Text reads the LORD's enemies}
102Sm 12:15 After Nathan returned to his home, the LORD sent a deadly illness to the child of David and Uriah's wife.
102Sm 12:16 David begged God to spare the child. He went without food and lay all night on the bare ground.
102Sm 12:17 The elders of his household pleaded with him to get up and eat with them, but he refused.
102Sm 12:18 Then on the seventh day the child died. David's advisers were afraid to tell him. "He wouldn't listen to reason while the child was ill," they said. "What drastic thing will he do when we tell him the child is dead?"
102Sm 12:19 When David saw them whispering, he realized what had happened. "Is the child dead?" he asked."Yes," they replied, "he is dead."
102Sm 12:20 Then David got up from the ground, washed himself, put on lotions¨ç, and changed his clothes. He went to the Tabernacle and worshiped the LORD. After that, he returned to the palace and was served food and ate. / ¨ç{Hebrew anointed himself}
102Sm 12:21 His advisers were amazed. "We don't understand you," they told him. "While the child was still living, you wept and refused to eat. But now that the child is dead, you have stopped your mourning and are eating again."
102Sm 12:22 David replied, "I fasted and wept while the child was alive, for I said, 'Perhaps the LORD will be gracious to me and let the child live.'
102Sm 12:23 But why should I fast when he is dead? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him one day, but he cannot return to me."
102Sm 12:24 Then David comforted Bathsheba, his wife, and slept with her. She became pregnant and gave birth to a son, and David¨ç named him Solomon. The LORD loved the child / ¨ç{Hebrew he; an alternate Hebrew reading and some Hebrew manuscripts read she}
102Sm 12:25 and sent word through Nathan the prophet that they should name him Jedidiah (which means "beloved of the LORD"), as the LORD had commanded¨ç. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads because of the LORD}
102Sm 12:26 Meanwhile, Joab was fighting against Rabbah, the capital of Ammon, and he captured the royal fortifications¨ç. / ¨ç{Or the royal city}
102Sm 12:27 Joab sent messengers to tell David, "I have fought against Rabbah and captured its water supply¨ç. / ¨ç{Or captured the city of water}
102Sm 12:28 Now bring the rest of the army and capture the city. Otherwise, I will capture it and get credit for the victory."
102Sm 12:29 So David gathered the rest of the army and went to Rabbah, and he fought against it and captured it.
102Sm 12:30 David removed the crown from the king's head¨ç, and it was placed on his own head. The crown was made of gold and set with gems, and it weighed seventy-five pounds¨è. David took a vast amount of plunder from the city. / ¨ç{Or from the head of Milcom (as in Greek version). Milcom, also called Molech, was the god of the Ammonites} ¨è{Hebrew 1 talent [34 kilograms]}
102Sm 12:31 He also made slaves of the people of Rabbah and forced them to labor with¨ç saws, iron picks, and iron axes, and to work in the brick kilns¨è. That is how he dealt with the people of all the Ammonite towns. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem. / ¨ç{Or He also brought out the people of Rabbah and put them under} ¨è{Or and he made them pass through the brick kilns}
102Sm 13:1 Now David's son Absalom had a beautiful sister named Tamar. And Amnon, her half brother, fell desperately in love with her.
102Sm 13:2 Amnon became so obsessed with Tamar that he became ill. She was a virgin, and Amnon thought he could never have her.
102Sm 13:3 But Amnon had a very crafty friend - his cousin Jonadab. He was the son of David's brother Shimea¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew Shimeah (also in 13.32), a variant spelling of Shimea; compare 1 Chr 2.13}
102Sm 13:4 One day Jonadab said to Amnon, "What's the trouble? Why should the son of a king look so dejected morning after morning?" So Amnon told him, "I am in love with Tamar, my brother Absalom's sister."
102Sm 13:5 "Well," Jonadab said, "I'll tell you what to do. Go back to bed and pretend you are ill. When your father comes to see you, ask him to let Tamar come and prepare some food for you. Tell him you'll feel better if she prepares it as you watch and feeds you with her own hands."
102Sm 13:6 So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick. And when the king came to see him, Amnon asked him, "Please let my sister Tamar come and cook my favorite dish¨ç as I watch. Then I can eat it from her own hands." / ¨ç{Or a couple of cakes; also in 13.8, 10}
102Sm 13:7 So David agreed and sent Tamar to Amnon's house to prepare some food for him.
102Sm 13:8 When Tamar arrived at Amnon's house, she went to the place where he was lying down so he could watch her mix some dough. Then she baked his favorite dish for him.
102Sm 13:9 But when she set the serving tray before him, he refused to eat. "Everyone get out of here," Amnon told his servants. So they all left.
102Sm 13:10 Then he said to Tamar, "Now bring the food into my bedroom and feed it to me here." So Tamar took his favorite dish to him.
102Sm 13:11 But as she was feeding him, he grabbed her and demanded, "Come to bed with me, my darling sister."
102Sm 13:12 "No, my brother!" she cried. "Don't be foolish! Don't do this to me! Such wicked things aren't done in Israel.
102Sm 13:13 Where could I go in my shame? And you would be called one of the greatest fools in Israel. Please, just speak to the king about it, and he will let you marry me."
102Sm 13:14 But Amnon wouldn't listen to her, and since he was stronger than she was, he raped her.
102Sm 13:15 Then suddenly Amnon's love turned to hate, and he hated her even more than he had loved her. "Get out of here!" he snarled at her.
102Sm 13:16 "No, no!" Tamar cried. "Sending me away now is worse than what you've already done to me." But Amnon wouldn't listen to her.
102Sm 13:17 He shouted for his servant and demanded, "Throw this woman out, and lock the door behind her!"
102Sm 13:18 So the servant put her out and locked the door behind her. She was wearing a long, beautiful robe¨ç, as was the custom in those days for the king's virgin daughters. / ¨ç{Or a robe with sleeves, or an ornamented robe. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain}
102Sm 13:19 But now Tamar tore her robe and put ashes on her head. And then, with her face in her hands, she went away crying.
102Sm 13:20 Her brother Absalom saw her and asked, "Is it true that Amnon has been with you? Well, my sister, keep quiet for now, since he's your brother. Don't you worry about it." So Tamar lived as a desolate woman in her brother Absalom's house.
102Sm 13:21 When King David heard what had happened, he was very angry¨ç. / ¨ç{Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version add But he did not punish his son Amnon, because he loved him, for he was his firstborn}
102Sm 13:22 And though Absalom never spoke to Amnon about this, he hated Amnon deeply because of what he had done to his sister.
102Sm 13:23 Two years later, when Absalom's sheep were being sheared at Baal-hazor near Ephraim, Absalom invited all the king's sons to come to a feast.
102Sm 13:24 He went to the king and said, "My sheep-shearers are now at work. Would the king and his servants please come to celebrate the occasion with me?"
102Sm 13:25 The king replied, "No, my son. If we all came, we would be too much of a burden on you." Absalom pressed him, but the king would not come, though he gave Absalom his blessing.
102Sm 13:26 "Well, then," Absalom said, "if you can't come, how about sending my brother Amnon with us?" "Why Amnon?" the king asked.
102Sm 13:27 But Absalom kept on pressing the king until he finally agreed to let all his sons attend, including Amnon. So Absalom prepared a feast fit for a king¨ç. / ¨ç{As in Greek and Latin versions (compare also Dead Sea Scrolls); the Hebrew text lacks this sentence}
102Sm 13:28 Absalom told his men, "Wait until Amnon gets drunk; then at my signal, kill him! Don't be afraid. I'm the one who has given the command. Take courage and do it!"
102Sm 13:29 So at Absalom's signal they murdered Amnon. Then the other sons of the king jumped on their mules and fled.
102Sm 13:30 As they were on the way back to Jerusalem, this report reached David£º "Absalom has killed all the king's sons; not one is left alive!"
102Sm 13:31 The king got up, tore his robe, and threw himself on the ground. His advisers also tore their clothes in horror and sorrow.
102Sm 13:32 But just then Jonadab, the son of David's brother Shimea, arrived and said, "No, don't believe that all the king's sons have been killed! It was only Amnon! Absalom has been plotting this ever since Amnon raped his sister Tamar.
102Sm 13:33 No, my lord the king, your sons aren't all dead! It was only Amnon."
102Sm 13:34 Meanwhile Absalom escaped. Then the watchman on the Jerusalem wall saw a great crowd coming down the hill on the road from the west. He ran to tell the king, "I see a crowd of people coming from the Horonaim road along the side of the hill."¨ç / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew lacks this sentence}
102Sm 13:35 "Look!" Jonadab told the king. "There they are now! The king's sons are coming, just as I said."
102Sm 13:36 They soon arrived, weeping and sobbing, and the king and all his servants wept bitterly with them.
102Sm 13:37 And David mourned many days for his son Amnon. Absalom fled to his grandfather, Talmai son of Ammihud, the king of Geshur.
102Sm 13:38 He stayed there in Geshur for three years.
102Sm 13:39 And King David¨ç, now reconciled to Amnon's death, longed to be reunited with his son Absalom¨è. / ¨ç{Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version read And the spirit of the king} ¨è{Or no longer felt a need to go out after Absalom}
102Sm 14:1 Joab realized how much the king longed to see Absalom.
102Sm 14:2 So he sent for a woman from Tekoa who had a reputation for great wisdom. He said to her, "Pretend you are in mourning; wear mourning clothes and don't put on lotions¨ç. Act like a woman who has been mourning for the dead for a long time. / ¨ç{Hebrew don't anoint yourself with oil}
102Sm 14:3 Then go to the king and tell him the story I am about to tell you." Then Joab told her what to say.
102Sm 14:4 When the woman from Tekoa approached the king, she bowed with her face to the ground in deep respect and cried out, "O king! Help me!"
102Sm 14:5 "What's the trouble?" the king asked."Alas, I am a widow!" she replied. "My husband is dead.
102Sm 14:6 My two sons had a fight out in the field. And since no one was there to stop it, one of them was killed.
102Sm 14:7 Now the rest of the family is demanding, 'Let us have your son. We will execute him for murdering his brother. He doesn't deserve to inherit his family's property.' They want to extinguish the only coal I have left, and my husband's name and family will disappear from the face of the earth."
102Sm 14:8 "Leave it to me," the king told her. "Go home, and I'll see to it that no one touches him."
102Sm 14:9 "Oh, thank you, my lord the king," the woman from Tekoa replied. "If you are criticized for helping me, let the blame fall on me and on my father's house, and let the king and his throne be innocent."
102Sm 14:10 "If anyone objects," the king said, "bring him to me. I can assure you he will never complain again!"
102Sm 14:11 Then she said, "Please swear to me by the LORD your God that you won't let anyone take vengeance against my son. I want no more bloodshed." "As surely as the LORD lives," he replied, "not a hair on your son's head will be disturbed!"
102Sm 14:12 "Please allow me to ask one more thing of my lord the king," she said."Go ahead and speak," he responded.
102Sm 14:13 She replied, "Why don't you do as much for the people of God as you have promised to do for me? You have convicted yourself in making this decision, because you have refused to bring home your own banished son.
102Sm 14:14 All of us must die eventually. Our lives are like water spilled out on the ground, which cannot be gathered up again. But God does not just sweep life away; instead, he devises ways to bring us back when we have been separated from him.
102Sm 14:15 "I have come to plead with my lord the king because people have threatened me. I said to myself, 'Perhaps the king will listen to me
102Sm 14:16 and rescue us from those who would cut us off from the inheritance¨ç God has given us. / ¨ç{Or the property; or the people}
102Sm 14:17 Yes, my lord the king will give us peace of mind again.' I know that you are like an angel of God in discerning good from evil. May the LORD your God be with you."
102Sm 14:18 "I must know one thing," the king replied, "and tell me the truth." "Yes, my lord the king," she responded.
102Sm 14:19 "Did Joab put you up to this?" And the woman replied, "My lord the king, how can I deny it? Nobody can hide anything from you. Yes, Joab sent me and told me what to say.
102Sm 14:20 He did it to place the matter before you in a different light. But you are as wise as an angel of God, and you understand everything that happens among us!"
102Sm 14:21 So the king sent for Joab and told him, "All right, go and bring back the young man Absalom."
102Sm 14:22 Joab bowed with his face to the ground in deep respect and said, "At last I know that I have gained your approval, my lord the king, for you have granted me this request!"
102Sm 14:23 Then Joab went to Geshur and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
102Sm 14:24 But the king gave this order£º "Absalom may go to his own house, but he must never come into my presence." So Absalom did not see the king.
102Sm 14:25 Now Absalom was praised as the most handsome man in all Israel. He was flawless from head to foot.
102Sm 14:26 He cut his hair only once a year, and then only because it was so heavy. When he weighed it out, it came to five pounds!¨ç / ¨ç{Hebrew 200 shekels [2.3 kilograms] by the royal standard}
102Sm 14:27 He had three sons and one daughter. His daughter's name was Tamar, and she was very beautiful.
102Sm 14:28 Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years, but he never got to see the king.
102Sm 14:29 Then Absalom sent for Joab to ask him to intercede for him, but Joab refused to come. Absalom sent for him a second time, but again Joab refused to come.
102Sm 14:30 So Absalom said to his servants, "Go and set fire to Joab's barley field, the field next to mine." So they set his field on fire, as Absalom had commanded.
102Sm 14:31 Then Joab came to Absalom at his house and demanded, "Why did your servants set my field on fire?"
102Sm 14:32 And Absalom replied, "Because I wanted you to ask the king why he brought me back from Geshur if he didn't intend to see me. I might as well have stayed there. Let me see the king; if he finds me guilty of anything, then let him kill me."
102Sm 14:33 So Joab told the king what Absalom had said. Then at last David summoned Absalom, who came and bowed low before the king, and the king kissed him.
102Sm 15:1 After this, Absalom bought a chariot and horses, and he hired fifty bodyguards to run ahead of him.
102Sm 15:2 He got up early every morning and went out to the gate of the city. When people brought a case to the king for judgment, Absalom would ask where in Israel they were from, and they would tell him their tribe.
102Sm 15:3 Then Absalom would say, "You've really got a strong case here! It's too bad the king doesn't have anyone to hear it.
102Sm 15:4 I wish I were the judge. Then everyone could bring their cases to me for judgment, and I would give them justice!"
102Sm 15:5 When people tried to bow before him, Absalom wouldn't let them. Instead, he took them by the hand and kissed them.
102Sm 15:6 Absalom did this with everyone who came to the king for judgment, and so he stole the hearts of all the people of Israel.
102Sm 15:7 After four years¨ç, Absalom said to the king, "Let me go to Hebron to offer a sacrifice to the LORD and fulfill a vow I made to him. / ¨ç{As in Greek and Syriac versions; Hebrew reads forty years}
102Sm 15:8 For while your servant was at Geshur in Aram, I promised to sacrifice to the LORD in Hebron¨ç if he would bring me back to Jerusalem." / ¨ç{As in some Greek manuscripts; Hebrew lacks in Hebron}
102Sm 15:9 "All right," the king told him. "Go and fulfill your vow." So Absalom went to Hebron.
102Sm 15:10 But while he was there, he sent secret messengers to all the tribes of Israel to stir up a rebellion against the king. "As soon as you hear the ram's horn," his message read, "you are to say, 'Absalom has been crowned king in Hebron.'"
102Sm 15:11 He took 200 men from Jerusalem with him as guests, but they knew nothing of his intentions.
102Sm 15:12 While Absalom was offering the sacrifices, he sent for Ahithophel, one of David's counselors who lived in Giloh. Soon many others also joined Absalom, and the conspiracy gained momentum.
102Sm 15:13 A messenger soon arrived in Jerusalem to tell David, "All Israel has joined Absalom in a conspiracy against you!"
102Sm 15:14 "Then we must flee at once, or it will be too late!" David urged his men. "Hurry! If we get out of the city before Absalom arrives, both we and the city of Jerusalem will be spared from disaster."
102Sm 15:15 "We are with you," his advisers replied. "Do what you think is best."
102Sm 15:16 So the king and all his household set out at once. He left no one behind except ten of his concubines to look after the palace.
102Sm 15:17 The king and all his people set out on foot, pausing at the last house
102Sm 15:18 to let all the king's men move past to lead the way. There were 600 men from Gath who had come with David, along with the king's bodyguard¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew the Kerethites and Pelethites}
102Sm 15:19 Then the king turned and said to Ittai, a leader of the men from Gath, "Why are you coming with us? Go on back to King Absalom, for you are a guest in Israel, a foreigner in exile.
102Sm 15:20 You arrived only recently, and should I force you today to wander with us? I don't even know where we will go. Go on back and take your kinsmen with you, and may the LORD show you his unfailing love and faithfulness¨ç." / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads and may unfailing love and faithfulness go with you}
102Sm 15:21 But Ittai said to the king, "I vow by the LORD and by your own life that I will go wherever my lord the king goes, no matter what happens - whether it means life or death."
102Sm 15:22 David replied, "All right, come with us." So Ittai and all his men and their families went along.
102Sm 15:23 Everyone cried loudly as the king and his followers passed by. They crossed the Kidron Valley and then went out toward the wilderness.
102Sm 15:24 Zadok and all the Levites also came along, carrying the Ark of the Covenant of God. They set down the Ark of God, and Abiathar offered sacrifices¨ç until everyone had passed out of the city. / ¨ç{Or Abiathar went up}
102Sm 15:25 Then the king instructed Zadok to take the Ark of God back into the city. "If the LORD sees fit," David said, "he will bring me back to see the Ark and the Tabernacle¨ç again. / ¨ç{Hebrew and his dwelling place}
102Sm 15:26 But if he is through with me, then let him do what seems best to him."
102Sm 15:27 The king also told Zadok the priest, "Look¨ç, here is my plan. You and Abiathar¨è should return quietly to the city with your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan. / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads Are you a seer? or Do you see?} ¨è{Hebrew lacks and Abiathar; compare 15.29}
102Sm 15:28 I will stop at the shallows of the Jordan River¨ç and wait there for a report from you." / ¨ç{Hebrew at the crossing points of the wilderness}
102Sm 15:29 So Zadok and Abiathar took the Ark of God back to the city and stayed there.
102Sm 15:30 David walked up the road to the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went. His head was covered and his feet were bare as a sign of mourning. And the people who were with him covered their heads and wept as they climbed the hill.
102Sm 15:31 When someone told David that his adviser Ahithophel was now backing Absalom, David prayed, "O LORD, let Ahithophel give Absalom foolish advice!"
102Sm 15:32 When David reached the summit of the Mount of Olives where people worshiped God, Hushai the Arkite was waiting there for him. Hushai had torn his clothing and put dirt on his head as a sign of mourning.
102Sm 15:33 But David told him, "If you go with me, you will only be a burden.
102Sm 15:34 Return to Jerusalem and tell Absalom, 'I will now be your adviser, O king, just as I was your father's adviser in the past.' Then you can frustrate and counter Ahithophel's advice.
102Sm 15:35 Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, will be there. Tell them about the plans being made in the king's palace,
102Sm 15:36 and they will send their sons Ahimaaz and Jonathan to tell me what is going on."
102Sm 15:37 So David's friend Hushai returned to Jerusalem, getting there just as Absalom arrived.
102Sm 16:1 When David had gone a little beyond the summit of the Mount of Olives, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth¨ç, was waiting there for him. He had two donkeys loaded with 200 loaves of bread, 100 clusters of raisins, 100 bunches of summer fruit, and a wineskin full of wine. / ¨ç{Mephibosheth is another name for Merib-baal}
102Sm 16:2 "What are these for?" the king asked Ziba.Ziba replied, "The donkeys are for the king's people to ride on, and the bread and summer fruit are for the young men to eat. The wine is for those who become exhausted in the wilderness."
102Sm 16:3 "And where is Mephibosheth, Saul's grandson?" the king asked him."He stayed in Jerusalem," Ziba replied. "He said, 'Today I will get back the kingdom of my grandfather Saul.'"
102Sm 16:4 "In that case," the king told Ziba, "I give you everything Mephibosheth owns." "I bow before you," Ziba replied. "May I always be pleasing to you, my lord the king."
102Sm 16:5 As King David came to Bahurim, a man came out of the village cursing them. It was Shimei son of Gera, from the same clan as Saul's family.
102Sm 16:6 He threw stones at the king and the king's officers and all the mighty warriors who surrounded him.
102Sm 16:7 "Get out of here, you murderer, you scoundrel!" he shouted at David.
102Sm 16:8 "The LORD is paying you back for all the bloodshed in Saul's clan. You stole his throne, and now the LORD has given it to your son Absalom. At last you will taste some of your own medicine, for you are a murderer!"
102Sm 16:9 "Why should this dead dog curse my lord the king?" Abishai son of Zeruiah demanded. "Let me go over and cut off his head!"
102Sm 16:10 "No!" the king said. "Who asked your opinion, you sons of Zeruiah! If the LORD has told him to curse me, who are you to stop him?"
102Sm 16:11 Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, "My own son is trying to kill me. Doesn't this relative of Saul¨ç have even more reason to do so? Leave him alone and let him curse, for the LORD has told him to do it. / ¨ç{Hebrew this Benjaminite}
102Sm 16:12 And perhaps the LORD will see that I am being wronged and will bless me because of these curses today."
102Sm 16:13 So David and his men continued down the road, and Shimei kept pace with them on a nearby hillside, cursing as he went and throwing stones at David and tossing dust into the air.
102Sm 16:14 The king and all who were with him grew weary along the way, so they rested when they reached the Jordan River¨ç. / ¨ç{As in Greek version (see also 17.16); Hebrew reads when they reached their destination}
102Sm 16:15 Meanwhile, Absalom and all the army of Israel arrived at Jerusalem, accompanied by Ahithophel.
102Sm 16:16 When David's friend Hushai the Arkite arrived, he went immediately to see Absalom. "Long live the king!" he exclaimed. "Long live the king!"
102Sm 16:17 "Is this the way you treat your friend David?" Absalom asked him. "Why aren't you with him?"
102Sm 16:18 "I'm here because I belong to the man who is chosen by the LORD and by all the men of Israel," Hushai replied.
102Sm 16:19 "And anyway, why shouldn't I serve you? Just as I was your father's adviser, now I will be your adviser!"
102Sm 16:20 Then Absalom turned to Ahithophel and asked him, "What should I do next?"
102Sm 16:21 Ahithophel told him, "Go and sleep with your father's concubines, for he has left them here to look after the palace. Then all Israel will know that you have insulted your father beyond hope of reconciliation, and they will throw their support to you."
102Sm 16:22 So they set up a tent on the palace roof where everyone could see it, and Absalom went in and had sex with his father's concubines.
102Sm 16:23 Absalom followed Ahithophel's advice, just as David had done. For every word Ahithophel spoke seemed as wise as though it had come directly from the mouth of God.
102Sm 17:1 Now Ahithophel urged Absalom, "Let me choose 12,000 men to start out after David tonight.
102Sm 17:2 I will catch up with him while he is weary and discouraged. He and his troops will panic, and everyone will run away. Then I will kill only the king,
102Sm 17:3 and I will bring all the people back to you as a bride returns to her husband. After all, it is only one man's life that you seek¨ç. Then you will be at peace with all the people." / ¨ç{As in Greek version; Hebrew reads like the return of all is the man whom you seek}
102Sm 17:4 This plan seemed good to Absalom and to all the elders of Israel.
102Sm 17:5 But then Absalom said, "Bring in Hushai the Arkite. Let's see what he thinks about this."
102Sm 17:6 When Hushai arrived, Absalom told him what Ahithophel had said. Then he asked, "What is your opinion? Should we follow Ahithophel's advice? If not, what do you suggest?"
102Sm 17:7 "Well," Hushai replied to Absalom, "this time Ahithophel has made a mistake.
102Sm 17:8 You know your father and his men; they are mighty warriors. Right now they are as enraged as a mother bear who has been robbed of her cubs. And remember that your father is an experienced man of war. He won't be spending the night among the troops.
102Sm 17:9 He has probably already hidden in some pit or cave. And when he comes out and attacks and a few of your men fall, there will be panic among your troops, and the word will spread that Absalom's men are being slaughtered.
102Sm 17:10 Then even the bravest soldiers, though they have the heart of a lion, will be paralyzed with fear. For all Israel knows what a mighty warrior your father is and how courageous his men are.
102Sm 17:11 "I recommend that you mobilize the entire army of Israel, bringing them from as far away as Dan in the north and Beersheba in the south. That way you will have an army as numerous as the sand on the seashore. And I advise that you personally lead the troops.
102Sm 17:12 When we find David, we'll fall on him like dew that falls on the ground. Then neither he nor any of his men will be left alive.
102Sm 17:13 And if David were to escape into some town, you will have all Israel there at your command. Then we can take ropes and drag the walls of the town into the nearest valley until every stone is torn down."
102Sm 17:14 Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, "Hushai's advice is better than Ahithophel's." For the LORD had determined to defeat the counsel of Ahithophel, which really was the better plan, so that he could bring disaster on Absalom!
102Sm 17:15 Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, what Ahithophel had said to Absalom and the elders of Israel and what he himself had advised instead.
102Sm 17:16 "Quick!" he told them. "Find David and urge him not to stay at the shallows of the Jordan River¨ç tonight. He must go across at once into the wilderness beyond. Otherwise he will die and his entire army with him." / ¨ç{Hebrew at the crossing points of the wilderness}
102Sm 17:17 Jonathan and Ahimaaz had been staying at En-rogel so as not to be seen entering and leaving the city. Arrangements had been made for a servant girl to bring them the message they were to take to King David.
102Sm 17:18 But a boy spotted them at En-rogel, and he told Absalom about it. So they quickly escaped to Bahurim, where a man hid them down inside a well in his courtyard.
102Sm 17:19 The man's wife put a cloth over the top of the well and scattered grain on it to dry in the sun; so no one suspected they were there.
102Sm 17:20 When Absalom's men arrived, they asked her, "Have you seen Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" The woman replied, "They were here, but they crossed over the brook." Absalom's men looked for them without success and returned to Jerusalem.
102Sm 17:21 Then the two men crawled out of the well and hurried on to King David. "Quick!" they told him, "cross the Jordan tonight!" And they told him how Ahithophel had advised that he be captured and killed.
102Sm 17:22 So David and all the people with him went across the Jordan River during the night, and they were all on the other bank before dawn.
102Sm 17:23 When Ahithophel realized that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey, went to his hometown, set his affairs in order, and hanged himself. He died there and was buried in the family tomb.
102Sm 17:24 David soon arrived at Mahanaim. By now, Absalom had mobilized the entire army of Israel and was leading his troops across the Jordan River.
102Sm 17:25 Absalom had appointed Amasa as commander of his army, replacing Joab, who had been commander under David. (Amasa was Joab's cousin. His father was Jether¨ç, an Ishmaelite¨è. His mother, Abigail daughter of Nahash, was the sister of Joab's mother, Zeruiah.) / ¨ç{Hebrew Ithra, a variant spelling of Jether} ¨è{As in some Greek manuscripts (see also 1 Chr 2.17); Hebrew reads an Israelite}
102Sm 17:26 Absalom and the Israelite army set up camp in the land of Gilead.
102Sm 17:27 When David arrived at Mahanaim, he was warmly greeted by Shobi son of Nahash, who came from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and by Makir son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and by Barzillai of Gilead from Rogelim.
102Sm 17:28 They brought sleeping mats, cooking pots, serving bowls, wheat and barley, flour and roasted grain, beans, lentils,
102Sm 17:29 honey, butter, sheep, goats, and cheese for David and those who were with him. For they said, "You must all be very hungry and tired and thirsty after your long march through the wilderness."
102Sm 18:1 David now mustered the men who were with him and appointed generals and captains¨ç to lead them. / ¨ç{Hebrew appointed commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds}
102Sm 18:2 He sent the troops out in three groups, placing one group under Joab, one under Joab's brother Abishai son of Zeruiah, and one under Ittai, the man from Gath. The king told his troops, "I am going out with you."
102Sm 18:3 But his men objected strongly. "You must not go," they urged. "If we have to turn and run - and even if half of us die - it will make no difference to Absalom's troops; they will be looking only for you. You are worth 10,000 of us¨ç, and it is better that you stay here in the town and send help if we need it." / ¨ç{As in two Hebrew manuscripts and some Greek and Latin manuscripts; most Hebrew manuscripts read Now there are 10,000 like us}
102Sm 18:4 "If you think that's the best plan, I'll do it," the king answered. So he stood alongside the gate of the town as all the troops marched out in groups of hundreds and of thousands.
102Sm 18:5 And the king gave this command to Joab, Abishai, and Ittai£º "For my sake, deal gently with young Absalom." And all the troops heard the king give this order to his commanders.
102Sm 18:6 So the battle began in the forest of Ephraim,
102Sm 18:7 and the Israelite troops were beaten back by David's men. There was a great slaughter that day, and 20,000 men laid down their lives.
102Sm 18:8 The battle raged all across the countryside, and more men died because of the forest than were killed by the sword.
102Sm 18:9 During the battle, Absalom happened to come upon some of David's men. He tried to escape on his mule, but as he rode beneath the thick branches of a great tree, his hair¨ç got caught in the tree. His mule kept going and left him dangling in the air. / ¨ç{Hebrew his head}
102Sm 18:10 One of David's men saw what had happened and told Joab, "I saw Absalom dangling from a great tree."
102Sm 18:11 "What?" Joab demanded. "You saw him there and didn't kill him? I would have rewarded you with ten pieces of silver¨ç and a hero's belt!" / ¨ç{Hebrew 10 shekels of silver, about 4 ounces or 114 grams in weight}
102Sm 18:12 "I would not kill the king's son for even a thousand pieces of silver¨ç," the man replied to Joab. "We all heard the king say to you and Abishai and Ittai, 'For my sake, please spare young Absalom.' / ¨ç{Hebrew 1,000 shekels, about 25 pounds or 11.4 kilograms in weight}
102Sm 18:13 And if I had betrayed the king by killing his son - and the king would certainly find out who did it - you yourself would be the first to abandon me."
102Sm 18:14 "Enough of this nonsense," Joab said. Then he took three daggers and plunged them into Absalom's heart as he dangled, still alive, in the great tree.
102Sm 18:15 Ten of Joab's young armor bearers then surrounded Absalom and killed him.
102Sm 18:16 Then Joab blew the ram's horn, and his men returned from chasing the army of Israel.
102Sm 18:17 They threw Absalom's body into a deep pit in the forest and piled a great heap of stones over it. And all Israel fled to their homes.
102Sm 18:18 During his lifetime, Absalom had built a monument to himself in the King's Valley, for he said, "I have no son to carry on my name." He named the monument after himself, and it is known as Absalom's Monument to this day.
102Sm 18:19 Then Zadok's son Ahimaaz said, "Let me run to the king with the good news that the LORD has rescued him from his enemies."
102Sm 18:20 "No," Joab told him, "it wouldn't be good news to the king that his son is dead. You can be my messenger another time, but not today."
102Sm 18:21 Then Joab said to a man from Ethiopia¨ç, "Go tell the king what you have seen." The man bowed and ran off. / ¨ç{Hebrew from Cush; similarly in 18.23, 31, 32}
102Sm 18:22 But Ahimaaz continued to plead with Joab, "Whatever happens, please let me go, too." "Why should you go, my son?" Joab replied. "There will be no reward for your news."
102Sm 18:23 "Yes, but let me go anyway," he begged.Joab finally said, "All right, go ahead." So Ahimaaz took the less demanding route by way of the plain and ran to Mahanaim ahead of the Ethiopian.
102Sm 18:24 While David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the town, the watchman climbed to the roof of the gateway by the wall. As he looked, he saw a lone man running toward them.
102Sm 18:25 He shouted the news down to David, and the king replied, "If he is alone, he has news." As the messenger came closer,
102Sm 18:26 the watchman saw another man running toward them. He shouted down, "Here comes another one!" The king replied, "He also will have news."
102Sm 18:27 "The first man runs like Ahimaaz son of Zadok," the watchman said."He is a good man and comes with good news," the king replied.
102Sm 18:28 Then Ahimaaz cried out to the king, "Everything is all right!" He bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, "Praise to the LORD your God, who has handed over the rebels who dared to stand against my lord the king."
102Sm 18:29 "What about young Absalom?" the king demanded. "Is he all right?" Ahimaaz replied, "When Joab told me to come, there was a lot of commotion. But I didn't know what was happening."
102Sm 18:30 "Wait here," the king told him. So Ahimaaz stepped aside.
102Sm 18:31 Then the man from Ethiopia arrived and said, "I have good news for my lord the king. Today the LORD has rescued you from all those who rebelled against you."
102Sm 18:32 "What about young Absalom?" the king demanded. "Is he all right?" And the Ethiopian replied, "May all of your enemies, my lord the king, both now and in the future, share the fate of that young man!"
102Sm 18:33 ¨çThe king was overcome with emotion. He went up to the room over the gateway and burst into tears. And as he went, he cried, "O my son Absalom! My son, my son Absalom! If only I had died instead of you! O Absalom, my son, my son." / ¨ç{Verse 18.33 is numbered 19.1 in Hebrew text}
102Sm 19:1 ¨çWord soon reached Joab that the king was weeping and mourning for Absalom. / ¨ç{Verses 19.1-43 are numbered 19.2-44 in Hebrew text}
102Sm 19:2 As all the people heard of the king's deep grief for his son, the joy of that day's victory was turned into deep sadness.
102Sm 19:3 They crept back into the town that day as though they were ashamed and had deserted in battle.
102Sm 19:4 The king covered his face with his hands and kept on crying, "O my son Absalom! O Absalom, my son, my son!"
102Sm 19:5 Then Joab went to the king's room and said to him, "We saved your life today and the lives of your sons, your daughters, and your wives and concubines. Yet you act like this, making us feel ashamed of ourselves.
102Sm 19:6 You seem to love those who hate you and hate those who love you. You have made it clear today that your commanders and troops mean nothing to you. It seems that if Absalom had lived and all of us had died, you would be pleased.
102Sm 19:7 Now go out there and congratulate your troops, for I swear by the LORD that if you don't go out, not a single one of them will remain here tonight. Then you will be worse off than ever before."
102Sm 19:8 So the king went out and took his seat at the town gate, and as the news spread throughout the town that he was there, everyone went to him.Meanwhile, the Israelites who had supported Absalom fled to their homes.
102Sm 19:9 And throughout all the tribes of Israel there was much discussion and argument going on. The people were saying, "The king rescued us from our enemies and saved us from the Philistines, but Absalom chased him out of the country.
102Sm 19:10 Now Absalom, whom we anointed to rule over us, is dead. Why not ask David to come back and be our king again?"
102Sm 19:11 Then King David sent Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, to say to the elders of Judah, "Why are you the last ones to welcome back the king into his palace? For I have heard that all Israel is ready.
102Sm 19:12 You are my relatives, my own tribe, my own flesh and blood! So why are you the last ones to welcome back the king?"
102Sm 19:13 And David told them to tell Amasa, "Since you are my own flesh and blood, like Joab, may God strike me and even kill me if I do not appoint you as commander of my army in his place."
102Sm 19:14 Then Amasa¨ç convinced all the men of Judah, and they responded unanimously. They sent word to the king, "Return to us, and bring back all who are with you." / ¨ç{Or David; Hebrew reads he}
102Sm 19:15 So the king started back to Jerusalem. And when he arrived at the Jordan River, the people of Judah came to Gilgal to meet him and escort him across the river.
102Sm 19:16 Shimei son of Gera, the man from Bahurim in Benjamin, hurried across with the men of Judah to welcome King David.
102Sm 19:17 A thousand other men from the tribe of Benjamin were with him, including Ziba, the chief servant of the house of Saul, and Ziba's fifteen sons and twenty servants. They rushed down to the Jordan to meet the king. They crossed the shallows of the Jordan to bring the king's household across the river, helping him in every way they could.
102Sm 19:18 As the king was about to cross the river, Shimei fell down before him.
102Sm 19:19 "My lord the king, please forgive me," he pleaded. "Forget the terrible thing your servant did when you left Jerusalem. May the king put it out of his mind.
102Sm 19:20 I know how much I sinned. That is why I have come here today, the very first person in all Israel¨ç to greet my lord the king." / ¨ç{Hebrew in the house of Joseph}
102Sm 19:21 Then Abishai son of Zeruiah said, "Shimei should die, for he cursed the LORD's anointed king!"
102Sm 19:22 "Who asked your opinion, you sons of Zeruiah!" David exclaimed. "Why have you become my adversary¨ç today? This is not a day for execution but for celebration! Today I am once again the king of Israel!" / ¨ç{Or my prosecutor}
102Sm 19:23 Then, turning to Shimei, David vowed, "Your life will be spared."
102Sm 19:24 Now Mephibosheth¨ç, Saul's grandson, came down from Jerusalem to meet the king. He had not cared for his feet, trimmed his beard, or washed his clothes since the day the king left Jerusalem. / ¨ç{Mephibosheth is another name for Merib-baal}
102Sm 19:25 "Why didn't you come with me, Mephibosheth?" the king asked him.
102Sm 19:26 Mephibosheth replied, "My lord the king, my servant Ziba deceived me. I told him, 'Saddle my donkey¨ç so I can go with the king.' For as you know I am crippled. / ¨ç{As in Greek, Syriac, and Latin versions; Hebrew reads I will saddle a donkey for myself}
102Sm 19:27 Ziba has slandered me by saying that I refused to come. But I know that my lord the king is like an angel of God, so do what you think is best.
102Sm 19:28 All my relatives and I could expect only death from you, my lord, but instead you have honored me by allowing me to eat at your own table! What more can I ask?"
102Sm 19:29 "You've said enough," David replied. "I've decided that you and Ziba will divide your land equally between you."
102Sm 19:30 "Give him all of it," Mephibosheth said. "I am content just to have you safely back again, my lord the king!"
102Sm 19:31 Barzillai of Gilead had come down from Rogelim to escort the king across the Jordan.
102Sm 19:32 He was very old, about eighty, and very wealthy. He was the one who had provided food for the king during his stay in Mahanaim.
102Sm 19:33 "Come across with me and live in Jerusalem," the king said to Barzillai. "I will take care of you there."
102Sm 19:34 "No," he replied, "I am far too old to go with the king to Jerusalem.
102Sm 19:35 I am eighty years old today, and I can no longer enjoy anything. Food and wine are no longer tasty, and I cannot hear the singers as they sing. I would only be a burden to my lord the king.
102Sm 19:36 Just to go across the Jordan River with the king is all the honor I need!
102Sm 19:37 Then let me return again to die in my own town, where my father and mother are buried. But here is your servant, my son Kimham. Let him go with my lord the king and receive whatever you want to give him."
102Sm 19:38 "Good," the king agreed. "Kimham will go with me, and I will help him in any way you would like. And I will do for you anything you want."
102Sm 19:39 So all the people crossed the Jordan with the king. After David had blessed Barzillai and kissed him, Barzillai returned to his own home.
102Sm 19:40 The king then crossed over to Gilgal, taking Kimham with him. All the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel escorted the king on his way.
102Sm 19:41 But all the men of Israel complained to the king, "The men of Judah stole the king and didn't give us the honor of helping take you, your household, and all your men across the Jordan."
102Sm 19:42 The men of Judah replied, "The king is one of our own kinsmen. Why should this make you angry? We haven't eaten any of the king's food or received any special favors!"
102Sm 19:43 "But there are ten tribes in Israel," the others replied. "So we have ten times as much right to the king as you do. What right do you have to treat us with such contempt? Weren't we the first to speak of bringing him back to be our king again?" The argument continued back and forth, and the men of Judah spoke even more harshly than the men of Israel.
102Sm 20:1 There happened to be a troublemaker there named Sheba son of Bicri, a man from the tribe of Benjamin. Sheba blew a ram's horn and began to chant£º "Down with the dynasty of David! We have no interest in the son of Jesse. Come on, you men of Israel, back to your homes!"
102Sm 20:2 So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba son of Bicri. But the men of Judah stayed with their king and escorted him from the Jordan River to Jerusalem.
102Sm 20:3 When David came to his palace in Jerusalem, he took the ten concubines he had left to look after the palace and placed them in seclusion. Their needs were provided for, but he no longer slept with them. So each of them lived like a widow until she died.
102Sm 20:4 Then the king told Amasa, "Mobilize the army of Judah within three days, and report back at that time."
102Sm 20:5 So Amasa went out to notify Judah, but it took him longer than the time he had been given.
102Sm 20:6 Then David said to Abishai, "Sheba son of Bicri is going to hurt us more than Absalom did. Quick, take my troops and chase after him before he gets into a fortified town where we can't reach him."
102Sm 20:7 So Abishai and Joab¨ç, together with the king's bodyguard¨è and all the mighty warriors, set out from Jerusalem to go after Sheba. / ¨ç{Hebrew So Joab's men} ¨è{Hebrew the Kerethites and Pelethites; also in 20.23}
102Sm 20:8 As they arrived at the great stone in Gibeon, Amasa met them. Joab was wearing his military tunic with a dagger strapped to his belt. As he stepped forward to greet Amasa, he slipped the dagger from its sheath¨ç. / ¨ç{Hebrew As he stepped forward, it fell out}
102Sm 20:9 "How are you, my cousin?" Joab said and took him by the beard with his right hand as though to kiss him.
102Sm 20:10 Amasa didn't notice the dagger in his left hand, and Joab stabbed him in the stomach with it so that his insides gushed out onto the ground. Joab did not need to strike again, and Amasa soon died. Joab and his brother Abishai left him lying there and continued after Sheba.
102Sm 20:11 One of Joab's young men shouted to Amasa's troops, "If you are for Joab and David, come and follow Joab."
102Sm 20:12 But Amasa lay in his blood in the middle of the road, and Joab's man saw that everyone was stopping to stare at him. So he pulled him off the road into a field and threw a cloak over him.
102Sm 20:13 With Amasa's body out of the way, everyone went on with Joab to capture Sheba son of Bicri.
102Sm 20:14 Meanwhile, Sheba traveled through all the tribes of Israel and eventually came to the town of Abel-beth-maacah. All the members of his own clan, the Bicrites¨ç, assembled for battle and followed him into the town. / ¨ç{As in Greek and Latin versions; Hebrew reads All the Berites}
102Sm 20:15 When Joab's forces arrived, they attacked Abel-beth-maacah. They built a siege ramp against the town's fortifications and began battering down the wall.
102Sm 20:16 But a wise woman in the town called out to Joab, "Listen to me, Joab. Come over here so I can talk to you."
102Sm 20:17 As he approached, the woman asked, "Are you Joab?" "I am," he replied.So she said, "Listen carefully to your servant." "I'm listening," he said.
102Sm 20:18 Then she continued, "There used to be a saying, 'If you want to settle an argument, ask advice at the town of Abel.'
102Sm 20:19 I am one who is peace loving and faithful in Israel. But you are destroying an important town in Israel¨ç. Why do you want to devour what belongs to the LORD?" / ¨ç{Hebrew a town that is a mother in Israel}
102Sm 20:20 And Joab replied, "Believe me, I don't want to devour or destroy your town!
102Sm 20:21 That's not my purpose. All I want is a man named Sheba son of Bicri from the hill country of Ephraim, who has revolted against King David. If you hand over this one man to me, I will leave the town in peace." "All right," the woman replied, "we will throw his head over the wall to you."
102Sm 20:22 Then the woman went to all the people with her wise advice, and they cut off Sheba's head and threw it out to Joab. So he blew the ram's horn and called his troops back from the attack. They all returned to their homes, and Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem.
102Sm 20:23 Now Joab was the commander of the army of Israel. Benaiah son of Jehoiada was captain of the king's bodyguard.
102Sm 20:24 Adoniram¨ç was in charge of the labor force. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the royal historian. / ¨ç{As in Greek version (see also 1 Kgs 4.6; 5.14); Hebrew reads Adoram}
102Sm 20:25 Sheva was the court secretary. Zadok and Abiathar were the priests.
102Sm 20:26 And Ira, a descendant of Jair, was David's personal priest.
102Sm 21:1 There was a famine during David's reign that lasted for three years, so David asked the LORD about it. And the LORD said, "The famine has come because Saul and his family are guilty of murdering the Gibeonites."
102Sm 21:2 So the king summoned the Gibeonites. They were not part of Israel but were all that was left of the nation of the Amorites. The people of Israel had sworn not to kill them, but Saul, in his zeal for Israel and Judah, had tried to wipe them out.
102Sm 21:3 David asked them, "What can I do for you? How can I make amends so that you will bless the LORD's people again?"
102Sm 21:4 "Well, money can't settle this matter between us and the family of Saul," the Gibeonites replied. "Neither can we demand the life of anyone in Israel." "What can I do then?" David asked. "Just tell me and I will do it for you."
102Sm 21:5 Then they replied, "It was Saul who planned to destroy us, to keep us from having any place at all in the territory of Israel.
102Sm 21:6 So let seven of Saul's sons be handed over to us, and we will execute them before the LORD at Gibeon, on the mountain of the LORD¨ç." "All right," the king said, "I will do it." / ¨ç{As in Greek version (see also 21.9); Hebrew reads at Gibeah of Saul, the chosen of the LORD}
102Sm 21:7 The king spared Jonathan's son Mephibosheth¨ç, who was Saul's grandson, because of the oath David and Jonathan had sworn before the LORD. / ¨ç{Mephibosheth is another name for Merib-baal}
102Sm 21:8 But he gave them Saul's two sons Armoni and Mephibosheth, whose mother was Rizpah daughter of Aiah. He also gave them the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab¨ç, the wife of Adriel son of Barzillai from Meholah. / ¨ç{As in a few Hebrew and Greek manuscripts and Syriac version (see also 1 Sam 18.19); most Hebrew manuscripts read Michal}
102Sm 21:9 The men of Gibeon executed them on the mountain before the LORD. So all seven of them died together at the beginning of the barley harvest.
102Sm 21:10 Then Rizpah daughter of Aiah, the mother of two of the men, spread burlap on a rock and stayed there the entire harvest season. She prevented the scavenger birds from tearing at their bodies during the day and stopped wild animals from eating them at night.
102Sm 21:11 When David learned what Rizpah, Saul's concubine, had done,
102Sm 21:12 he went to the people of Jabesh-gilead and retrieved the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan. (When the Philistines had killed Saul and Jonathan on Mount Gilboa, the people of Jabesh-gilead stole their bodies from the public square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hung them.)
102Sm 21:13 So David obtained the bones of Saul and Jonathan, as well as the bones of the men the Gibeonites had executed.
102Sm 21:14 Then the king ordered that they bury the bones in the tomb of Kish, Saul's father, at the town of Zela in the land of Benjamin. After that, God ended the famine in the land.
102Sm 21:15 Once again the Philistines were at war with Israel. And when David and his men were in the thick of battle, David became weak and exhausted.
102Sm 21:16 Ishbi-benob was a descendant of the giants¨ç; his bronze spearhead weighed more than seven pounds¨è, and he was armed with a new sword. He had cornered David and was about to kill him. / ¨ç{Or a descendant of the Rapha; also in 21.18, 20, 22} ¨è{Hebrew 300 shekels [3.4 kilograms]}
102Sm 21:17 But Abishai son of Zeruiah came to David's rescue and killed the Philistine. Then David's men declared, "You are not going out to battle with us again! Why risk snuffing out the light of Israel?"
102Sm 21:18 After this, there was another battle against the Philistines at Gob. As they fought, Sibbecai from Hushah killed Saph, another descendant of the giants.
102Sm 21:19 During another battle at Gob, Elhanan son of Jair¨ç from Bethlehem killed the brother of Goliath of Gath¨è. The handle of his spear was as thick as a weaver's beam! / ¨ç{As in parallel text at 1 Chr 20.5; Hebrew reads son of Jaare-oregim} ¨è{As in parallel text at 1 Chr 20.5; Hebrew reads killed Goliath of Gath}
102Sm 21:20 In another battle with the Philistines at Gath, they encountered a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all, who was also a descendant of the giants.
102Sm 21:21 But when he defied and taunted Israel, he was killed by Jonathan, the son of David's brother Shimea¨ç. / ¨ç{As in parallel text at 1 Chr 20.7; Hebrew reads Shimei, a variant spelling of Shimea}
102Sm 21:22 These four Philistines were descendants of the giants of Gath, but David and his warriors killed them.
102Sm 22:1 David sang this song to the LORD on the day the LORD rescued him from all his enemies and from Saul.
102Sm 22:2 He sang£º "The LORD is my rock, my fortress, and my savior;
102Sm 22:3 my God is my rock, in whom I find protection. He is my shield, the power that saves me, and my place of safety. He is my refuge, my savior, the one who saves me from violence.
102Sm 22:4 I called on the LORD, who is worthy of praise, and he saved me from my enemies.
102Sm 22:5 "The waves of death overwhelmed me; floods of destruction swept over me.
102Sm 22:6 The grave¨ç wrapped its ropes around me; death laid a trap in my path. / ¨ç{Hebrew Sheol}
102Sm 22:7 But in my distress I cried out to the LORD; yes, I cried to my God for help. He heard me from his sanctuary; my cry reached his ears.
102Sm 22:8 "Then the earth quaked and trembled.The foundations of the heavens shook; they quaked because of his anger.
102Sm 22:9 Smoke poured from his nostrils; fierce flames leaped from his mouth.Glowing coals blazed forth from him.
102Sm 22:10 He opened the heavens and came down; dark storm clouds were beneath his feet.
102Sm 22:11 Mounted on a mighty angelic being¨ç, he flew, soaring¨è on the wings of the wind. / ¨ç{Hebrew a cherub} ¨è{As in some Hebrew manuscripts (see also Ps 18.10); other Hebrew manuscripts read appearing}
102Sm 22:12 He shrouded himself in darkness, veiling his approach with dense rain clouds.
102Sm 22:13 A great brightness shone around him, and burning coals¨ç blazed forth. / ¨ç{Or and lightning bolts}
102Sm 22:14 The LORD thundered from heaven; the voice of the Most High resounded.
102Sm 22:15 He shot arrows and scattered his enemies; his lightning flashed, and they were confused.
102Sm 22:16 Then at the command of the LORD, at the blast of his breath, the bottom of the sea could be seen, and the foundations of the earth were laid bare.
102Sm 22:17 "He reached down from heaven and rescued me; he drew me out of deep waters.
102Sm 22:18 He rescued me from my powerful enemies, from those who hated me and were too strong for me.
102Sm 22:19 They attacked me at a moment when I was in distress, but the LORD supported me.
102Sm 22:20 He led me to a place of safety; he rescued me because he delights in me.
102Sm 22:21 The LORD rewarded me for doing right; he restored me because of my innocence.
102Sm 22:22 For I have kept the ways of the LORD; I have not turned from my God to follow evil.
102Sm 22:23 I have followed all his regulations; I have never abandoned his decrees.
102Sm 22:24 I am blameless before God; I have kept myself from sin.
102Sm 22:25 The LORD rewarded me for doing right.He has seen my innocence.
102Sm 22:26 "To the faithful you show yourself faithful; to those with integrity you show integrity.
102Sm 22:27 To the pure you show yourself pure, but to the wicked you show yourself hostile.
102Sm 22:28 You rescue the humble, but your eyes watch the proud and humiliate them.
102Sm 22:29 O LORD, you are my lamp.The LORD lights up my darkness.
102Sm 22:30 In your strength I can crush an army; with my God I can scale any wall.
102Sm 22:31 "God's way is perfect.All the LORD's promises prove true.He is a shield for all who look to him for protection.
102Sm 22:32 For who is God except the LORD? Who but our God is a solid rock?
102Sm 22:33 God is my strong fortress, and he makes my way perfect.
102Sm 22:34 He makes me as surefooted as a deer, enabling me to stand on mountain heights.
102Sm 22:35 He trains my hands for battle; he strengthens my arm to draw a bronze bow.
102Sm 22:36 You have given me your shield of victory; your help¨ç has made me great. / ¨ç{As in Dead Sea Scrolls (see also Ps 18.35); Masoretic Text reads your answering}
102Sm 22:37 You have made a wide path for my feet to keep them from slipping.
102Sm 22:38 "I chased my enemies and destroyed them; I did not stop until they were conquered.
102Sm 22:39 I consumed them; I struck them down so they did not get up; they fell beneath my feet.
102Sm 22:40 You have armed me with strength for the battle; you have subdued my enemies under my feet.
102Sm 22:41 You placed my foot on their necks.I have destroyed all who hated me.
102Sm 22:42 They looked for help, but no one came to their rescue.They even cried to the LORD, but he refused to answer.
102Sm 22:43 I ground them as fine as the dust of the earth; I trampled them¨ç in the gutter like dirt. / ¨ç{As in Dead Sea Scrolls (see also Ps 18.42); Masoretic Text reads I crushed and trampled them}
102Sm 22:44 "You gave me victory over my accusers.You preserved me as the ruler over nations; people I don't even know now serve me.
102Sm 22:45 Foreign nations cringe before me; as soon as they hear of me, they submit.
102Sm 22:46 They all lose their courage and come trembling¨ç from their strongholds. / ¨ç{As in parallel text at Ps 18.45; Hebrew reads come girding themselves}
102Sm 22:47 "The LORD lives! Praise to my Rock! May God, the Rock of my salvation, be exalted!
102Sm 22:48 He is the God who pays back those who harm me; he brings down the nations under me
102Sm 22:49 and delivers me from my enemies. You hold me safe beyond the reach of my enemies; you save me from violent opponents.
102Sm 22:50 For this, O LORD, I will praise you among the nations; I will sing praises to your name.
102Sm 22:51 You give great victories to your king; you show unfailing love to your anointed, to David and all his descendants forever."
102Sm 23:1 These are the last words of David£º "David, the son of Jesse, speaks - David, the man who was raised up so high, David, the man anointed by the God of Jacob, David, the sweet psalmist of Israel¨ç. / ¨ç{Or the favorite subject of the songs of Israel; or the favorite of the Strong One of Israel}
102Sm 23:2 "The Spirit of the LORD speaks through me; his words are upon my tongue.
102Sm 23:3 The God of Israel spoke.The Rock of Israel said to me£º 'The one who rules righteously, who rules in the fear of God,
102Sm 23:4 is like the light of morning at sunrise, like a morning without clouds, like the gleaming of the sun on new grass after rain.'
102Sm 23:5 "Is it not my family God has chosen? Yes, he has made an everlasting covenant with me. His agreement is arranged and guaranteed in every detail.He will ensure my safety and success.
102Sm 23:6 But the godless are like thorns to be thrown away, for they tear the hand that touches them.
102Sm 23:7 One must use iron tools to chop them down; they will be totally consumed by fire."
102Sm 23:8 These are the names of David's mightiest warriors. The first was Jashobeam the Hacmonite¨ç, who was leader of the Three¨è - the three mightiest warriors among David's men. He once used his spear to kill 800 enemy warriors in a single battle¨é. / ¨ç{As in parallel text at 1 Chr 11.11; Hebrew reads Josheb-basshebeth the Tahkemonite} ¨è{As in Greek and Latin versions (see also 1 Chr 11.11); the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain} ¨é{As in some Greek manuscripts (see also 1 Chr 11.11); the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain, though it might be rendered the Three. It was Adino the Eznite who killed 800 men at one time}
102Sm 23:9 Next in rank among the Three was Eleazar son of Dodai, a descendant of Ahoah. Once Eleazar and David stood together against the Philistines when the entire Israelite army had fled.
102Sm 23:10 He killed Philistines until his hand was too tired to lift his sword, and the LORD gave him a great victory that day. The rest of the army did not return until it was time to collect the plunder!
102Sm 23:11 Next in rank was Shammah son of Agee from Harar. One time the Philistines gathered at Lehi and attacked the Israelites in a field full of lentils. The Israelite army fled,
102Sm 23:12 but Shammah¨ç held his ground in the middle of the field and beat back the Philistines. So the LORD brought about a great victory. / ¨ç{Hebrew he}
102Sm 23:13 Once during the harvest, when David was at the cave of Adullam, the Philistine army was camped in the valley of Rephaim. The Three (who were among the Thirty - an elite group among David's fighting men) went down to meet him there.
102Sm 23:14 David was staying in the stronghold at the time, and a Philistine detachment had occupied the town of Bethlehem.
102Sm 23:15 David remarked longingly to his men, "Oh, how I would love some of that good water from the well by the gate in Bethlehem."
102Sm 23:16 So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew some water from the well by the gate in Bethlehem, and brought it back to David. But he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as an offering to the LORD.
102Sm 23:17 "The LORD forbid that I should drink this!" he exclaimed. "This water is as precious as the blood of these men¨ç who risked their lives to bring it to me." So David did not drink it. These are examples of the exploits of the Three. / ¨ç{Hebrew Shall I drink the blood of these men?}
102Sm 23:18 Abishai son of Zeruiah, the brother of Joab, was the leader of the Thirty¨ç. He once used his spear to kill 300 enemy warriors in a single battle. It was by such feats that he became as famous as the Three. / ¨ç{As in a few Hebrew manuscripts and Syriac version; most Hebrew manuscripts read the Three}
102Sm 23:19 Abishai was the most famous of the Thirty¨ç and was their commander, though he was not one of the Three. / ¨ç{As in Syriac version; Hebrew reads the Three}
102Sm 23:20 There was also Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant warrior¨ç from Kabzeel. He did many heroic deeds, which included killing two champions¨è of Moab. Another time, on a snowy day, he chased a lion down into a pit and killed it. / ¨ç{Or son of Jehoiada, son of Ish-hai} ¨è{Hebrew two of Ariel}
102Sm 23:21 Once, armed only with a club, he killed a great Egyptian warrior who was armed with a spear. Benaiah wrenched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with it.
102Sm 23:22 Deeds like these made Benaiah as famous as the Three mightiest warriors.
102Sm 23:23 He was more honored than the other members of the Thirty, though he was not one of the Three. And David made him captain of his bodyguard.
102Sm 23:24 Other members of the Thirty included£º Asahel, Joab's brother; Elhanan son of Dodo from Bethlehem;
102Sm 23:25 Shammah from Harod; Elika from Harod;
102Sm 23:26 Helez from Pelon¨ç; Ira son of Ikkesh from Tekoa; / ¨ç{As in parallel text at 1 Chr 11.27 (see also 1 Chr 27.10); Hebrew reads from Palti}

102Sm 23:39 Uriah the Hittite. There were thirty-seven in all.
102Sm 24:1 Once again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and he caused David to harm them by taking a census. "Go and count the people of Israel and Judah," the LORD told him.
102Sm 24:2 So the king said to Joab and the commanders¨ç of the army, "Take a census of all the tribes of Israel - from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south - so I may know how many people there are." / ¨ç{As in Greek version (see also 24.4 and 1 Chr 21.2); Hebrew reads Joab the commander}
102Sm 24:3 But Joab replied to the king, "May the LORD your God let you live to see a hundred times as many people as there are now! But why, my lord the king, do you want to do this?"
102Sm 24:4 But the king insisted that they take the census, so Joab and the commanders of the army went out to count the people of Israel.
102Sm 24:5 First they crossed the Jordan and camped at Aroer, south of the town in the valley, in the direction of Gad. Then they went on to Jazer,
102Sm 24:6 then to Gilead in the land of Tahtim-hodshi¨ç and to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon. / ¨ç{Greek version reads to Gilead and to Kadesh in the land of the Hittites}
102Sm 24:7 Then they came to the fortress of Tyre, and all the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Finally, they went south to Judah¨ç as far as Beersheba. / ¨ç{Or they went to the Negev of Judah}
102Sm 24:8 Having gone through the entire land for nine months and twenty days, they returned to Jerusalem.
102Sm 24:9 Joab reported the number of people to the king. There were 800,000 capable warriors in Israel who could handle a sword, and 500,000 in Judah.
102Sm 24:10 But after he had taken the census, David's conscience began to bother him. And he said to the LORD, "I have sinned greatly by taking this census. Please forgive my guilt, LORD, for doing this foolish thing."
102Sm 24:11 The next morning the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, who was David's seer. This was the message.
102Sm 24:12 "Go and say to David, 'This is what the LORD says£º I will give you three choices. Choose one of these punishments, and I will inflict it on you.'"
102Sm 24:13 So Gad came to David and asked him, "Will you choose three¨ç years of famine throughout your land, three months of fleeing from your enemies, or three days of severe plague throughout your land? Think this over and decide what answer I should give the LORD who sent me." / ¨ç{As in Greek version (see also 1 Chr 21.12); Hebrew reads seven}
102Sm 24:14 "I'm in a desperate situation!" David replied to Gad. "But let us fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is great. Do not let me fall into human hands."
102Sm 24:15 So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel that morning, and it lasted for three days¨ç. A total of 70,000 people died throughout the nation, from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south. / ¨ç{Hebrew for the designated time}
102Sm 24:16 But as the angel was preparing to destroy Jerusalem, the LORD relented and said to the death angel, "Stop! That is enough!" At that moment the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
102Sm 24:17 When David saw the angel, he said to the LORD, "I am the one who has sinned and done wrong! But these people are as innocent as sheep - what have they done? Let your anger fall against me and my family."
102Sm 24:18 That day Gad came to David and said to him, "Go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite."
102Sm 24:19 So David went up to do what the LORD had commanded him.
102Sm 24:20 When Araunah saw the king and his men coming toward him, he came and bowed before the king with his face to the ground.
102Sm 24:21 "Why have you come, my lord the king?" Araunah asked.David replied, "I have come to buy your threshing floor and to build an altar to the LORD there, so that he will stop the plague."
102Sm 24:22 "Take it, my lord the king, and use it as you wish," Araunah said to David. "Here are oxen for the burnt offering, and you can use the threshing boards and ox yokes for wood to build a fire on the altar.
102Sm 24:23 I will give it all to you, Your Majesty, and may the LORD your God accept your sacrifice."
102Sm 24:24 But the king replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on buying it, for I will not present burnt offerings to the LORD my God that have cost me nothing." So David paid him fifty pieces of silver¨ç for the threshing floor and the oxen. / ¨ç{Hebrew 50 shekels of silver, about 20 ounces or 570 grams in weight}
102Sm 24:25 David built an altar there to the LORD and sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings. And the LORD answered his prayer for the land, and the plague on Israel was stopped.
