44Ac 1:1 In my first book�� I told you, Theophilus, about everything Jesus began to do and teach / ��The reference is to the Gospel of Luke
44Ac 1:2 until the day he was taken up to heaven after giving his chosen apostles further instructions through the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 1:3 During the forty days after his crucifixion, he appeared to the apostles from time to time, and he proved to them in many ways that he was actually alive. And he talked to them about the Kingdom of God.
44Ac 1:4 Once when he was eating with them, he commanded them, "Do not leave Jerusalem until the Father sends you the gift he promised, as I told you before.
44Ac 1:5 John baptized with�� water, but in just a few days you will be baptized with�� the Holy Spirit." / ��Or in
44Ac 1:6 So when the apostles were with Jesus, they kept asking him, "Lord, has the time come for you to free Israel and restore our kingdom?"
44Ac 1:7 He replied, "The Father alone has the authority to set those dates and times, and they are not for you to know.
44Ac 1:8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. And you will be my witnesses, telling people about me everywhere?in Jerusalem, throughout Judea, in Samaria, and to the ends of the earth."
44Ac 1:9 After saying this, he was taken up into a cloud while they were watching, and they could no longer see him.
44Ac 1:10 As they strained to see him rising into heaven, two white-robed men suddenly stood among them.
44Ac 1:11 "Men of Galilee," they said, "why are you standing here staring into heaven? Jesus has been taken from you into heaven, but someday he will return from heaven in the same way you saw him go!"
44Ac 1:12 Then the apostles returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, a distance of half a mile��. / ��Greek a Sabbath day's journey
44Ac 1:13 When they arrived, they went to the upstairs room of the house where they were staying. Here are the names of those who were present�� Peter, John, James, Andrew, Philip, Thomas, Bartholomew, Matthew, James (son of Alphaeus), Simon (the Zealot), and Judas (son of James).
44Ac 1:14 They all met together and were constantly united in prayer, along with Mary the mother of Jesus, several other women, and the brothers of Jesus.
44Ac 1:15 During this time, when about 120 believers�� were together in one place, Peter stood up and addressed them. / ��Greek brothers
44Ac 1:16 "Brothers," he said, "the Scriptures had to be fulfilled concerning Judas, who guided those who arrested Jesus. This was predicted long ago by the Holy Spirit, speaking through King David.
44Ac 1:17 Judas was one of us and shared in the ministry with us."
44Ac 1:18 (Judas had bought a field with the money he received for his treachery. Falling headfirst there, his body split open, spilling out all his intestines.
44Ac 1:19 The news of his death spread to all the people of Jerusalem, and they gave the place the Aramaic name Akeldama, which means "Field of Blood.")
44Ac 1:20 Peter continued, "This was written in the book of Psalms, where it says, `Let his home become desolate, with no one living in it.' It also says, `Let someone else take his position.'�� / ��Pss 69.25; 109.8
44Ac 1:21 "So now we must choose a replacement for Judas from among the men who were with us the entire time we were traveling with the Lord Jesus?
44Ac 1:22 from the time he was baptized by John until the day he was taken from us. Whoever is chosen will join us as a witness of Jesus' resurrection."
44Ac 1:23 So they nominated two men�� Joseph called Barsabbas (also known as Justus) and Matthias.
44Ac 1:24 Then they all prayed, "O Lord, you know every heart. Show us which of these men you have chosen
44Ac 1:25 as an apostle to replace Judas in this ministry, for he has deserted us and gone where he belongs."
44Ac 1:26 Then they cast lots, and Matthias was selected to become an apostle with the other eleven.
44Ac 2:1 On the day of Pentecost�� all the believers were meeting together in one place. / ��The Festival of Pentecost came 50 days after Passover (when Jesus was crucified)
44Ac 2:2 Suddenly, there was a sound from heaven like the roaring of a mighty windstorm, and it filled the house where they were sitting.
44Ac 2:3 Then, what looked like flames or tongues of fire appeared and settled on each of them.
44Ac 2:4 And everyone present was filled with the Holy Spirit and began speaking in other languages��, as the Holy Spirit gave them this ability. / ��Or in other tongues
44Ac 2:5 At that time there were devout Jews from every nation living in Jerusalem.
44Ac 2:6 When they heard the loud noise, everyone came running, and they were bewildered to hear their own languages being spoken by the believers.
44Ac 2:7 They were completely amazed. "How can this be?" they exclaimed. "These people are all from Galilee,
44Ac 2:8 and yet we hear them speaking in our own native languages!
44Ac 2:9 Here we are?Parthians, Medes, Elamites, people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, the province of Asia,
44Ac 2:10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, and the areas of Libya around Cyrene, visitors from Rome
44Ac 2:11 (both Jews and converts to Judaism), Cretans, and Arabs. And we all hear these people speaking in our own languages about the wonderful things God has done!"
44Ac 2:12 They stood there amazed and perplexed. "What can this mean?" they asked each other.
44Ac 2:13 But others in the crowd ridiculed them, saying, "They're just drunk, that's all!"
44Ac 2:14 Then Peter stepped forward with the eleven other apostles and shouted to the crowd, "Listen carefully, all of you, fellow Jews and residents of Jerusalem! Make no mistake about this.
44Ac 2:15 These people are not drunk, as some of you are assuming. Nine o'clock in the morning is much too early for that.
44Ac 2:16 No, what you see was predicted long ago by the prophet Joel.
44Ac 2:17 `In the last days,' God says, `I will pour out my Spirit upon all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy Your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.
44Ac 2:18 In those days I will pour out my Spirit even on my servants?men and women alike? and they will prophesy.
44Ac 2:19 And I will cause wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below? blood and fire and clouds of smoke.
44Ac 2:20 The sun will become dark, and the moon will turn blood red before that great and glorious day of the LORD arrives.
44Ac 2:21 But everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved.'�� / ��Joel 2.28-32
44Ac 2:22 "People of Israel, listen! God publicly endorsed Jesus the Nazarene�� by doing powerful miracles, wonders, and signs through him, as you well know. / ��Or Jesus of Nazareth
44Ac 2:23 But God knew what would happen, and his prearranged plan was carried out when Jesus was betrayed. With the help of lawless Gentiles, you nailed him to a cross and killed him.
44Ac 2:24 But God released him from the horrors of death and raised him back to life, for death could not keep him in its grip.
44Ac 2:25 King David said this about him�� `I see that the LORD is always with me I will not be shaken, for he is right beside me.
44Ac 2:26 No wonder my heart is glad, and my tongue shouts his praises! My body rests in hope.
44Ac 2:27 For you will not leave my soul among the dead�� or allow your Holy One to rot in the grave. / ��Greek in Hades
44Ac 2:28 You have shown me the way of life, and you will fill me with the joy of your presence.'�� / ��Ps 16.8-11 (Greek version)
44Ac 2:29 "Dear brothers, think about this! You can be sure that the patriarch David wasn't referring to himself, for he died and was buried, and his tomb is still here among us.
44Ac 2:30 But he was a prophet, and he knew God had promised with an oath that one of David's own descendants would sit on his throne.
44Ac 2:31 David was looking into the future and speaking of the Messiah's resurrection. He was saying that God would not leave him among the dead�� or allow his body to rot in the grave. / ��Greek in Hades
44Ac 2:32 "God raised Jesus from the dead, and we are all witnesses of this.
44Ac 2:33 Now he is exalted to the place of highest honor in heaven, at God's right hand. And the Father, as he had promised, gave him the Holy Spirit to pour out upon us, just as you see and hear today.
44Ac 2:34 For David himself never ascended into heaven, yet he said, `The LORD said to my Lord, "Sit in the place of honor at my right hand
44Ac 2:35 until I humble your enemies, making them a footstool under your feet."'�� / ��Ps 110.1
44Ac 2:36 "So let everyone in Israel know for certain that God has made this Jesus, whom you crucified, to be both Lord and Messiah!"
44Ac 2:37 Peter's words pierced their hearts, and they said to him and to the other apostles, "Brothers, what should we do?"
44Ac 2:38 Peter replied, "Each of you must repent of your sins and turn to God, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 2:39 This promise is to you, and to your children, and even to the Gentiles�� - all who have been called by the Lord our God." / ��Or and to people far in the future; Greek reads and to those far away
44Ac 2:40 Then Peter continued preaching for a long time, strongly urging all his listeners, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation!"
44Ac 2:41 Those who believed what Peter said were baptized and added to the church that day?about 3,000 in all.
44Ac 2:42 All the believers devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching, and to fellowship, and to sharing in meals (including the Lord's Supper��), and to prayer. / ��Greek the breaking of bread; also in 2.46
44Ac 2:43 A deep sense of awe came over them all, and the apostles performed many miraculous signs and wonders.
44Ac 2:44 And all the believers met together in one place and shared everything they had.
44Ac 2:45 They sold their property and possessions and shared the money with those in need.
44Ac 2:46 They worshiped together at the Temple each day, met in homes for the Lord's Supper, and shared their meals with great joy and generosity��. / ��Or and sincere hearts
44Ac 2:47 all the while praising God and enjoying the goodwill of all the people. And each day the Lord added to their fellowship those who were being saved.
44Ac 3:1 Peter and John went to the Temple one afternoon to take part in the three o'clock prayer service.
44Ac 3:2 As they approached the Temple, a man lame from birth was being carried in. Each day he was put beside the Temple gate, the one called the Beautiful Gate, so he could beg from the people going into the Temple.
44Ac 3:3 When he saw Peter and John about to enter, he asked them for some money.
44Ac 3:4 Peter and John looked at him intently, and Peter said, "Look at us!"
44Ac 3:5 The lame man looked at them eagerly, expecting some money.
44Ac 3:6 But Peter said, "I don't have any silver or gold for you. But I'll give you what I have. In the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene��, get up and�� walk!" / ��Or Jesus Christ of Nazareth ��Some manuscripts omit get up and
44Ac 3:7 Then Peter took the lame man by the right hand and helped him up. And as he did, the man's feet and ankles were instantly healed and strengthened.
44Ac 3:8 He jumped up, stood on his feet, and began to walk! Then, walking, leaping, and praising God, he went into the Temple with them.
44Ac 3:9 All the people saw him walking and heard him praising God.
44Ac 3:10 When they realized he was the lame beggar they had seen so often at the Beautiful Gate, they were absolutely astounded!
44Ac 3:11 They all rushed out in amazement to Solomon's Colonnade, where the man was holding tightly to Peter and John.
44Ac 3:12 Peter saw his opportunity and addressed the crowd. "People of Israel," he said, "what is so surprising about this? And why stare at us as though we had made this man walk by our own power or godliness?
44Ac 3:13 For it is the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob?the God of all our ancestors?who has brought glory to his servant Jesus by doing this. This is the same Jesus whom you handed over and rejected before Pilate, despite Pilate's decision to release him.
44Ac 3:14 You rejected this holy, righteous one and instead demanded the release of a murderer.
44Ac 3:15 You killed the author of life, but God raised him from the dead. And we are witnesses of this fact!
44Ac 3:16 "Through faith in the name of Jesus, this man was healed?and you know how crippled he was before. Faith in Jesus' name has healed him before your very eyes.
44Ac 3:17 "Friends��, I realize that what you and your leaders did to Jesus was done in ignorance. / ��Greek Brothers
44Ac 3:18 But God was fulfilling what all the prophets had foretold about the Messiah?that he must suffer these things.
44Ac 3:19 Now repent of your sins and turn to God, so that your sins may be wiped away.
44Ac 3:20 Then times of refreshment will come from the presence of the Lord, and he will again send you Jesus, your appointed Messiah.
44Ac 3:21 For he must remain in heaven until the time for the final restoration of all things, as God promised long ago through his holy prophets.
44Ac 3:22 Moses said, `The LORD your God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from among your own people. Listen carefully to everything he tells you.'�� / ��Deut 18.15
44Ac 3:23 Then Moses said, `Anyone who will not listen to that Prophet will be completely cut off from God's people.'�� / ��Deut 18.19; Lev 23.29
44Ac 3:24 "Starting with Samuel, every prophet spoke about what is happening today.
44Ac 3:25 You are the children of those prophets, and you are included in the covenant God promised to your ancestors. For God said to Abraham, `Through your descendants�� all the families on earth will be blessed.' / ��Greek your seed; see Gen 12.3; 22.18
44Ac 3:26 When God raised up his servant, Jesus, he sent him first to you people of Israel, to bless you by turning each of you back from your sinful ways."
44Ac 4:1 While Peter and John were speaking to the people, they were confronted by the priests, the captain of the Temple guard, and some of the Sadducees.
44Ac 4:2 These leaders were very disturbed that Peter and John were teaching the people that through Jesus there is a resurrection of the dead.
44Ac 4:3 They arrested them and, since it was already evening, put them in jail until morning.
44Ac 4:4 But many of the people who heard their message believed it, so the number of believers now totaled about 5,000 men, not counting women and children��. / ��Greek 5,000 adult males
44Ac 4:5 The next day the council of all the rulers and elders and teachers of religious law met in Jerusalem.
44Ac 4:6 Annas the high priest was there, along with Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and other relatives of the high priest.
44Ac 4:7 They brought in the two disciples and demanded, "By what power, or in whose name, have you done this?"
44Ac 4:8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and elders of our people,
44Ac 4:9 are we being questioned today because we've done a good deed for a crippled man? Do you want to know how he was healed?
44Ac 4:10 Let me clearly state to all of you and to all the people of Israel that he was healed by the powerful name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene��, the man you crucified but whom God raised from the dead. / ��Or Jesus Christ of Nazareth
44Ac 4:11 For Jesus is the one referred to in the Scriptures, where it says, `The stone that you builders rejected has now become the cornerstone.'�� / ��Ps 118.22
44Ac 4:12 There is salvation in no one else! God has given no other name under heaven by which we must be saved."
44Ac 4:13 The members of the council were amazed when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, for they could see that they were ordinary men with no special training in the Scriptures. They also recognized them as men who had been with Jesus.
44Ac 4:14 But since they could see the man who had been healed standing right there among them, there was nothing the council could say.
44Ac 4:15 So they ordered Peter and John out of the council chamber�� and conferred among themselves. / ��Greek the Sanhedrin
44Ac 4:16 "What should we do with these men?" they asked each other. "We can't deny that they have performed a miraculous sign, and everybody in Jerusalem knows about it.
44Ac 4:17 But to keep them from spreading their propaganda any further, we must warn them not to speak to anyone in Jesus' name again."
44Ac 4:18 So they called the apostles back in and commanded them never again to speak or teach in the name of Jesus.
44Ac 4:19 But Peter and John replied, "Do you think God wants us to obey you rather than him?
44Ac 4:20 We cannot stop telling about everything we have seen and heard."
44Ac 4:21 The council then threatened them further, but they finally let them go because they didn't know how to punish them without starting a riot. For everyone was praising God
44Ac 4:22 for this miraculous sign?the healing of a man who had been lame for more than forty years.
44Ac 4:23 As soon as they were freed, Peter and John returned to the other believers and told them what the leading priests and elders had said.
44Ac 4:24 When they heard the report, all the believers lifted their voices together in prayer to God�� "O Sovereign Lord, Creator of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them?
44Ac 4:25 you spoke long ago by the Holy Spirit through our ancestor David, your servant, saying, `Why were the nations so angry? Why did they waste their time with futile plans?
44Ac 4:26 The kings of the earth prepared for battle; the rulers gathered together against the LORD and against his Messiah.'�� / ��Or his anointed one; or his Christ. Ps 2.1-2
44Ac 4:27 "In fact, this has happened here in this very city! For Herod Antipas, Pontius Pilate the governor, the Gentiles, and the people of Israel were all united against Jesus, your holy servant, whom you anointed.
44Ac 4:28 But everything they did was determined beforehand according to your will.
44Ac 4:29 And now, O Lord, hear their threats, and give us, your servants, great boldness in preaching your word.
44Ac 4:30 Stretch out your hand with healing power; may miraculous signs and wonders be done through the name of your holy servant Jesus."
44Ac 4:31 After this prayer, the meeting place shook, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit. Then they preached the word of God with boldness.
44Ac 4:32 All the believers were united in heart and mind. And they felt that what they owned was not their own, so they shared everything they had.
44Ac 4:33 The apostles testified powerfully to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and God's great blessing was upon them all.
44Ac 4:34 There were no needy people among them, because those who owned land or houses would sell them
44Ac 4:35 and bring the money to the apostles to give to those in need.
44Ac 4:36 For instance, there was Joseph, the one the apostles nicknamed Barnabas (which means "Son of Encouragement"). He was from the tribe of Levi and came from the island of Cyprus.
44Ac 4:37 He sold a field he owned and brought the money to the apostles.
44Ac 5:1 But there was a certain man named Ananias who, with his wife, Sapphira, sold some property.
44Ac 5:2 He brought part of the money to the apostles, claiming it was the full amount. With his wife's consent, he kept the rest.
44Ac 5:3 Then Peter said, "Ananias, why have you let Satan fill your heart? You lied to the Holy Spirit, and you kept some of the money for yourself.
44Ac 5:4 The property was yours to sell or not sell, as you wished. And after selling it, the money was also yours to give away. How could you do a thing like this? You weren't lying to us but to God!"
44Ac 5:5 As soon as Ananias heard these words, he fell to the floor and died. Everyone who heard about it was terrified.
44Ac 5:6 Then some young men got up, wrapped him in a sheet, and took him out and buried him.
44Ac 5:7 About three hours later his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
44Ac 5:8 Peter asked her, "Was this the price you and your husband received for your land?" "Yes," she replied, "that was the price."
44Ac 5:9 And Peter said, "How could the two of you even think of conspiring to test the Spirit of the Lord like this? The young men who buried your husband are just outside the door, and they will carry you out, too."
44Ac 5:10 Instantly, she fell to the floor and died. When the young men came in and saw that she was dead, they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
44Ac 5:11 Great fear gripped the entire church and everyone else who heard what had happened.
44Ac 5:12 The apostles were performing many miraculous signs and wonders among the people. And all the believers were meeting regularly at the Temple in the area known as Solomon's Colonnade.
44Ac 5:13 But no one else dared to join them, even though all the people had high regard for them.
44Ac 5:14 Yet more and more people believed and were brought to the Lord?crowds of both men and women.
44Ac 5:15 As a result of the apostles' work, sick people were brought out into the streets on beds and mats so that Peter's shadow might fall across some of them as he went by.
44Ac 5:16 Crowds came from the villages around Jerusalem, bringing their sick and those possessed by evil�� spirits, and they were all healed. / ��Greek unclean
44Ac 5:17 The high priest and his officials, who were Sadducees, were filled with jealousy.
44Ac 5:18 They arrested the apostles and put them in the public jail.
44Ac 5:19 But an angel of the Lord came at night, opened the gates of the jail, and brought them out. Then he told them,
44Ac 5:20 "Go to the Temple and give the people this message of life!"
44Ac 5:21 So at daybreak the apostles entered the Temple, as they were told, and immediately began teachingWhen the high priest and his officials arrived, they convened the high council�� - the full assembly of the elders of Israel. Then they sent for the apostles to be brought from the jail for trial. / ��Greek Sanhedrin; also in 5.27, 41
44Ac 5:22 But when the Temple guards went to the jail, the men were gone. So they returned to the council and reported,
44Ac 5:23 "The jail was securely locked, with the guards standing outside, but when we opened the gates, no one was there!"
44Ac 5:24 When the captain of the Temple guard and the leading priests heard this, they were perplexed, wondering where it would all end.
44Ac 5:25 Then someone arrived with startling news�� "The men you put in jail are standing in the Temple, teaching the people!"
44Ac 5:26 The captain went with his Temple guards and arrested the apostles, but without violence, for they were afraid the people would stone them.
44Ac 5:27 Then they brought the apostles before the high council, where the high priest confronted them.
44Ac 5:28 "Didn't we tell you never again to teach in this man's name?" he demanded. "Instead, you have filled all Jerusalem with your teaching about him, and you want to make us responsible for his death!"
44Ac 5:29 But Peter and the apostles replied, "We must obey God rather than any human authority.
44Ac 5:30 The God of our ancestors raised Jesus from the dead after you killed him by hanging him on a cross��. / ��Greek on a tree
44Ac 5:31 Then God put him in the place of honor at his right hand as Prince and Savior. He did this so the people of Israel would repent of their sins and be forgiven.
44Ac 5:32 We are witnesses of these things and so is the Holy Spirit, who is given by God to those who obey him."
44Ac 5:33 When they heard this, the high council was furious and decided to kill them.
44Ac 5:34 But one member, a Pharisee named Gamaliel, who was an expert in religious law and respected by all the people, stood up and ordered that the men be sent outside the council chamber for a while.
44Ac 5:35 Then he said to his colleagues, "Men of Israel, take care what you are planning to do to these men!
44Ac 5:36 Some time ago there was that fellow Theudas, who pretended to be someone great. About 400 others joined him, but he was killed, and all his followers went their various ways. The whole movement came to nothing.
44Ac 5:37 After him, at the time of the census, there was Judas of Galilee. He got people to follow him, but he was killed, too, and all his followers were scattered.
44Ac 5:38 "So my advice is, leave these men alone. Let them go. If they are planning and doing these things merely on their own, it will soon be overthrown.
44Ac 5:39 But if it is from God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You may even find yourselves fighting against God!"
44Ac 5:40 The others accepted his advice. They called in the apostles and had them flogged. Then they ordered them never again to speak in the name of Jesus, and they let them go.
44Ac 5:41 The apostles left the high council rejoicing that God had counted them worthy to suffer disgrace for the name of Jesus��. / ��Greek for the name
44Ac 5:42 And every day, in the Temple and from house to house, they continued to teach and preach this message�� "Jesus is the Messiah."
44Ac 6:1 But as the believers�� rapidly multiplied, there were rumblings of discontent. The Greek-speaking believers complained about the Hebrew-speaking believers, saying that their widows were being discriminated against in the daily distribution of food. / ��Greek disciples; also in 6.2, 7
44Ac 6:2 So the Twelve called a meeting of all the believers. They said, "We apostles should spend our time teaching the word of God, not running a food program.
44Ac 6:3 And so, brothers, select seven men who are well respected and are full of the Spirit and wisdom. We will give them this responsibility.
44Ac 6:4 Then we apostles can spend our time in prayer and teaching the word."
44Ac 6:5 Everyone liked this idea, and they chose the following�� Stephen (a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit), Philip, Procorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolas of Antioch (an earlier convert to the Jewish faith).
44Ac 6:6 These seven were presented to the apostles, who prayed for them as they laid their hands on them.
44Ac 6:7 So God's message continued to spread. The number of believers greatly increased in Jerusalem, and many of the Jewish priests were converted, too.
44Ac 6:8 Stephen, a man full of God's grace and power, performed amazing miracles and signs among the people.
44Ac 6:9 But one day some men from the Synagogue of Freed Slaves, as it was called, started to debate with him. They were Jews from Cyrene, Alexandria, Cilicia, and the province of Asia.
44Ac 6:10 None of them could stand against the wisdom and the Spirit with which Stephen spoke.
44Ac 6:11 So they persuaded some men to lie about Stephen, saying, "We heard him blaspheme Moses, and even God."
44Ac 6:12 This roused the people, the elders, and the teachers of religious law. So they arrested Stephen and brought him before the high council��. / ��Greek Sanhedrin
44Ac 6:13 The lying witnesses said, "This man is always speaking against the holy Temple and against the law of Moses.
44Ac 6:14 We have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth�� will destroy the Temple and change the customs Moses handed down to us." / ��Or Jesus the Nazarene
44Ac 6:15 At this point everyone in the high council�� stared at Stephen, because his face became as bright as an angel's. / ��Greek Sanhedrin
44Ac 7:1 Then the high priest asked Stephen, "Are these accusations true?"
44Ac 7:2 This was Stephen's reply�� "Brothers and fathers, listen to me. Our glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham in Mesopotamia before he settled in Haran��. / ��Mesopotamia was the region now called Iraq. Haran was a city in what is now called Syria
44Ac 7:3 God told him, `Leave your native land and your relatives, and come into the land that I will show you.'�� / ��Gen 12.1
44Ac 7:4 So Abraham left the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran until his father died. Then God brought him here to the land where you now live.
44Ac 7:5 "But God gave him no inheritance here, not even one square foot of land. God did promise, however, that eventually the whole land would belong to Abraham and his descendants?even though he had no children yet.
44Ac 7:6 God also told him that his descendants would live in a foreign land, where they would be oppressed as slaves for 400 years.
44Ac 7:7 `But I will punish the nation that enslaves them,' God said, `and in the end they will come out and worship me here in this place.'�� / ��Gen 12.7; 15.13-14; Exod 3.12
44Ac 7:8 "God also gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision at that time. So when Abraham became the father of Isaac, he circumcised him on the eighth day. And the practice was continued when Isaac became the father of Jacob, and when Jacob became the father of the twelve patriarchs of the Israelite nation.
44Ac 7:9 "These patriarchs were jealous of their brother Joseph, and they sold him to be a slave in Egypt. But God was with him
44Ac 7:10 and rescued him from all his troubles. And God gave him favor before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. God also gave Joseph unusual wisdom, so that Pharaoh appointed him governor over all of Egypt and put him in charge of the palace.
44Ac 7:11 "But a famine came upon Egypt and Canaan. There was great misery, and our ancestors ran out of food.
44Ac 7:12 Jacob heard that there was still grain in Egypt, so he sent his sons?our ancestors?to buy some.
44Ac 7:13 The second time they went, Joseph revealed his identity to his brothers��, and they were introduced to Pharaoh. / ��Other manuscripts read Joseph was recognized by his brothers
44Ac 7:14 Then Joseph sent for his father, Jacob, and all his relatives to come to Egypt, seventy-five persons in all.
44Ac 7:15 So Jacob went to Egypt. He died there, as did our ancestors.
44Ac 7:16 Their bodies were taken to Shechem and buried in the tomb Abraham had bought for a certain price from Hamor's sons in Shechem.
44Ac 7:17 "As the time drew near when God would fulfill his promise to Abraham, the number of our people in Egypt greatly increased.
44Ac 7:18 But then a new king came to the throne of Egypt who knew nothing about Joseph.
44Ac 7:19 This king exploited our people and oppressed them, forcing parents to abandon their newborn babies so they would die.
44Ac 7:20 "At that time Moses was born?a beautiful child in God's eyes. His parents cared for him at home for three months.
44Ac 7:21 When they had to abandon him, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and raised him as her own son.
44Ac 7:22 Moses was taught all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was powerful in both speech and action.
44Ac 7:23 "One day when Moses was forty years old, he decided to visit his relatives, the people of Israel.
44Ac 7:24 He saw an Egyptian mistreating an Israelite. So Moses came to the man's defense and avenged him, killing the Egyptian.
44Ac 7:25 Moses assumed his fellow Israelites would realize that God had sent him to rescue them, but they didn't.
44Ac 7:26 "The next day he visited them again and saw two men of Israel fighting. He tried to be a peacemaker. `Men,' he said, `you are brothers. Why are you fighting each other?'
44Ac 7:27 "But the man in the wrong pushed Moses aside. `Who made you a ruler and judge over us?' he asked.
44Ac 7:28 `Are you going to kill me as you killed that Egyptian yesterday?'
44Ac 7:29 When Moses heard that, he fled the country and lived as a foreigner in the land of Midian. There his two sons were born.
44Ac 7:30 "Forty years later, in the desert near Mount Sinai, an angel appeared to Moses in the flame of a burning bush.
44Ac 7:31 When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight. As he went to take a closer look, the voice of the LORD called out to him,
44Ac 7:32 `I am the God of your ancestors?the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' Moses shook with terror and did not dare to look.
44Ac 7:33 "Then the LORD said to him, `Take off your sandals, for you are standing on holy ground.
44Ac 7:34 I have certainly seen the oppression of my people in Egypt. I have heard their groans and have come down to rescue them. Now go, for I am sending you back to Egypt.'�� / ��Exod 3.5-10
44Ac 7:35 "So God sent back the same man his people had previously rejected when they demanded, `Who made you a ruler and judge over us?' Through the angel who appeared to him in the burning bush, God sent Moses to be their ruler and savior.
44Ac 7:36 And by means of many wonders and miraculous signs, he led them out of Egypt, through the Red Sea, and through the wilderness for forty years.
44Ac 7:37 "Moses himself told the people of Israel, `God will raise up for you a Prophet like me from among your own people.'�� / ��Deut 18.15
44Ac 7:38 Moses was with our ancestors, the assembly of God's people in the wilderness, when the angel spoke to him at Mount Sinai. And there Moses received life-giving words to pass on to us��. / ��Some manuscripts read to you
44Ac 7:39 "But our ancestors refused to listen to Moses. They rejected him and wanted to return to Egypt.
44Ac 7:40 They told Aaron, `Make us some gods who can lead us, for we don't know what has become of this Moses, who brought us out of Egypt.'
44Ac 7:41 So they made an idol shaped like a calf, and they sacrificed to it and celebrated over this thing they had made.
44Ac 7:42 Then God turned away from them and abandoned them to serve the stars of heaven as their gods! In the book of the prophets it is written, `Was it to me you were bringing sacrifices and offerings during those forty years in the wilderness, Israel?
44Ac 7:43 No, you carried your pagan gods? the shrine of Molech, the star of your god Rephan, and the images you made to worship them. So I will send you into exile as far away as Babylon.'�� / ��Amos 5.25-27 (Greek version)
44Ac 7:44 "Our ancestors carried the Tabernacle�� with them through the wilderness. It was constructed according to the plan God had shown to Moses. / ��Greek the tent of witness
44Ac 7:45 Years later, when Joshua led our ancestors in battle against the nations that God drove out of this land, the Tabernacle was taken with them into their new territory. And it stayed there until the time of King David.
44Ac 7:46 "David found favor with God and asked for the privilege of building a permanent Temple for the God of Jacob��. / ��Some manuscripts read the house of Jacob
44Ac 7:47 But it was Solomon who actually built it.
44Ac 7:48 However, the Most High doesn't live in temples made by human hands. As the prophet says,
44Ac 7:49 `Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Could you build me a temple as good as that?' asks the LORD. `Could you build me such a resting place?
44Ac 7:50 Didn't my hands make both heaven and earth?'�� / ��Isa 66.1-2
44Ac 7:51 "You stubborn people! You are heathen�� at heart and deaf to the truth. Must you forever resist the Holy Spirit? That's what your ancestors did, and so do you! / ��Greek uncircumcised
44Ac 7:52 Name one prophet your ancestors didn't persecute! They even killed the ones who predicted the coming of the Righteous One?the Messiah whom you betrayed and murdered.
44Ac 7:53 You deliberately disobeyed God's law, even though you received it from the hands of angels."
44Ac 7:54 The Jewish leaders were infuriated by Stephen's accusation, and they shook their fists at him in rage��. / ��Greek they were grinding their teeth against him
44Ac 7:55 But Stephen, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed steadily into heaven and saw the glory of God, and he saw Jesus standing in the place of honor at God's right hand.
44Ac 7:56 And he told them, "Look, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing in the place of honor at God's right hand!"
44Ac 7:57 Then they put their hands over their ears and began shouting. They rushed at him
44Ac 7:58 and dragged him out of the city and began to stone him. His accusers took off their coats and laid them at the feet of a young man named Saul��. / ��Saul is later called Paul; see 13.9
44Ac 7:59 As they stoned him, Stephen prayed, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
44Ac 7:60 He fell to his knees, shouting, "Lord, don't charge them with this sin!" And with that, he died.
44Ac 8:1 Saul was one of the witnesses, and he agreed completely with the killing of Stephen. A great wave of persecution began that day, sweeping over the church in Jerusalem; and all the believers except the apostles were scattered through the regions of Judea and Samaria.
44Ac 8:2 (Some devout men came and buried Stephen with great mourning.)
44Ac 8:3 But Saul was going everywhere to destroy the church. He went from house to house, dragging out both men and women to throw them into prison.
44Ac 8:4 But the believers who were scattered preached the Good News about Jesus wherever they went.
44Ac 8:5 Philip, for example, went to the city of Samaria and told the people there about the Messiah.
44Ac 8:6 Crowds listened intently to Philip because they were eager to hear his message and see the miraculous signs he did.
44Ac 8:7 Many evil�� spirits were cast out, screaming as they left their victims. And many who had been paralyzed or lame were healed. / ��Greek unclean
44Ac 8:8 So there was great joy in that city.
44Ac 8:9 A man named Simon had been a sorcerer there for many years, amazing the people of Samaria and claiming to be someone great.
44Ac 8:10 Everyone, from the least to the greatest, often spoke of him as "the Great One?the Power of God."
44Ac 8:11 They listened closely to him because for a long time he had astounded them with his magic.
44Ac 8:12 But now the people believed Philip's message of Good News concerning the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ. As a result, many men and women were baptized.
44Ac 8:13 Then Simon himself believed and was baptized. He began following Philip wherever he went, and he was amazed by the signs and great miracles Philip performed.
44Ac 8:14 When the apostles in Jerusalem heard that the people of Samaria had accepted God's message, they sent Peter and John there.
44Ac 8:15 As soon as they arrived, they prayed for these new believers to receive the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 8:16 The Holy Spirit had not yet come upon any of them, for they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 8:17 Then Peter and John laid their hands upon these believers, and they received the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 8:18 When Simon saw that the Spirit was given when the apostles laid their hands on people, he offered them money to buy this power.
44Ac 8:19 "Let me have this power, too," he exclaimed, "so that when I lay my hands on people, they will receive the Holy Spirit!"
44Ac 8:20 But Peter replied, "May your money be destroyed with you for thinking God's gift can be bought!
44Ac 8:21 You can have no part in this, for your heart is not right with God.
44Ac 8:22 Repent of your wickedness and pray to the Lord. Perhaps he will forgive your evil thoughts,
44Ac 8:23 for I can see that you are full of bitter jealousy and are held captive by sin."
44Ac 8:24 "Pray to the Lord for me," Simon exclaimed, "that these terrible things you've said won't happen to me!"
44Ac 8:25 After testifying and preaching the word of the Lord in Samaria, Peter and John returned to Jerusalem. And they stopped in many Samaritan villages along the way to preach the Good News.
44Ac 8:26 As for Philip, an angel of the Lord said to him, "Go south�� down the desert road that runs from Jerusalem to Gaza." / ��Or Go at noon
44Ac 8:27 So he started out, and he met the treasurer of Ethiopia, a eunuch of great authority under the Kandake, the queen of Ethiopia. The eunuch had gone to Jerusalem to worship,
44Ac 8:28 and he was now returning. Seated in his carriage, he was reading aloud from the book of the prophet Isaiah.
44Ac 8:29 The Holy Spirit said to Philip, "Go over and walk along beside the carriage."
44Ac 8:30 Philip ran over and heard the man reading from the prophet Isaiah. Philip asked, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
44Ac 8:31 The man replied, "How can I, unless someone instructs me?" And he urged Philip to come up into the carriage and sit with him.
44Ac 8:32 The passage of Scripture he had been reading was this�� "He was led like a sheep to the slaughter And as a lamb is silent before the shearers, he did not open his mouth.
44Ac 8:33 He was humiliated and received no justice Who can speak of his descendants? For his life was taken from the earth."�� / ��Isa 53.7-8 (Greek version)
44Ac 8:34 The eunuch asked Philip, "Tell me, was the prophet talking about himself or someone else?"
44Ac 8:35 So beginning with this same Scripture, Philip told him the Good News about Jesus.
44Ac 8:36 As they rode along, they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "Look! There's some water! Why can't I be baptized?"��
44Ac 8:37 �� / ��Some manuscripts add verse 37, "You can," Philip answered, "if you believe with all your heart." And the eunuch replied, "I believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God."
44Ac 8:38 He ordered the carriage to stop, and they went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.
44Ac 8:39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away. The eunuch never saw him again but went on his way rejoicing.
44Ac 8:40 Meanwhile, Philip found himself farther north at the town of Azotus. He preached the Good News there and in every town along the way until he came to Caesarea.
44Ac 9:1 Meanwhile, Saul was uttering threats with every breath and was eager to kill the Lord's followers��. So he went to the high priest. / ��Greek disciples
44Ac 9:2 He requested letters addressed to the synagogues in Damascus, asking for their cooperation in the arrest of any followers of the Way he found there. He wanted to bring them?both men and women?back to Jerusalem in chains.
44Ac 9:3 As he was approaching Damascus on this mission, a light from heaven suddenly shone down around him.
44Ac 9:4 He fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me?"
44Ac 9:5 "Who are you, lord?" Saul asked And the voice replied, "I am Jesus, the one you are persecuting!
44Ac 9:6 Now get up and go into the city, and you will be told what you must do."
44Ac 9:7 The men with Saul stood speechless, for they heard the sound of someone's voice but saw no one!
44Ac 9:8 Saul picked himself up off the ground, but when he opened his eyes he was blind. So his companions led him by the hand to Damascus.
44Ac 9:9 He remained there blind for three days and did not eat or drink.
44Ac 9:10 Now there was a believer�� in Damascus named Ananias. The Lord spoke to him in a vision, calling, "Ananias!" "Yes, Lord!" he replied. / ��Greek disciple; also in 9.26, 36
44Ac 9:11 The Lord said, "Go over to Straight Street, to the house of Judas. When you get there, ask for a man from Tarsus named Saul. He is praying to me right now.
44Ac 9:12 I have shown him a vision of a man named Ananias coming in and laying hands on him so he can see again."
44Ac 9:13 "But Lord," exclaimed Ananias, "I've heard many people talk about the terrible things this man has done to the believers�� in Jerusalem! / ��Greek God's holy people; also in 9.32, 41
44Ac 9:14 And he is authorized by the leading priests to arrest everyone who calls upon your name."
44Ac 9:15 But the Lord said, "Go, for Saul is my chosen instrument to take my message to the Gentiles and to kings, as well as to the people of Israel.
44Ac 9:16 And I will show him how much he must suffer for my name's sake."
44Ac 9:17 So Ananias went and found Saul. He laid his hands on him and said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road, has sent me so that you might regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
44Ac 9:18 Instantly something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he got up and was baptized.
44Ac 9:19 Afterward he ate some food and regained his strength. Saul stayed with the believers�� in Damascus for a few days. / ��Greek disciples
44Ac 9:20 And immediately he began preaching about Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is indeed the Son of God!"
44Ac 9:21 All who heard him were amazed. "Isn't this the same man who caused such devastation among Jesus' followers in Jerusalem?" they asked. "And didn't he come here to arrest them and take them in chains to the leading priests?"
44Ac 9:22 Saul's preaching became more and more powerful, and the Jews in Damascus couldn't refute his proofs that Jesus was indeed the Messiah.
44Ac 9:23 After a while some of the Jews plotted together to kill him.
44Ac 9:24 They were watching for him day and night at the city gate so they could murder him, but Saul was told about their plot.
44Ac 9:25 So during the night, some of the other believers�� lowered him in a large basket through an opening in the city wall. / ��Greek his disciples
44Ac 9:26 When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to meet with the believers��, but they were all afraid of him. They did not believe he had truly become a believer! / ��Greek disciples
44Ac 9:27 Then Barnabas brought him to the apostles and told them how Saul had seen the Lord on the way to Damascus and how the Lord had spoken to Saul. He also told them that Saul had preached boldly in the name of Jesus in Damascus.
44Ac 9:28 So Saul stayed with the apostles and went all around Jerusalem with them, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord.
44Ac 9:29 He debated with some Greek-speaking Jews, but they tried to murder him.
44Ac 9:30 When the believers�� heard about this, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus, his hometown. / ��Greek brothers
44Ac 9:31 The church then had peace throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria, and it became stronger as the believers lived in the fear of the Lord. And with the encouragement of the Holy Spirit, it also grew in numbers.
44Ac 9:32 Meanwhile, Peter traveled from place to place, and he came down to visit the believers in the town of Lydda.
44Ac 9:33 There he met a man named Aeneas, who had been paralyzed and bedridden for eight years.
44Ac 9:34 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you! Get up, and roll up your sleeping mat!" And he was healed instantly.
44Ac 9:35 Then the whole population of Lydda and Sharon saw Aeneas walking around, and they turned to the Lord.
44Ac 9:36 There was a believer in Joppa named Tabitha (which in Greek is Dorcas��). She was always doing kind things for others and helping the poor. / ��The names Tabitha in Aramaic and Dorcas in Greek both mean "gazelle."
44Ac 9:37 About this time she became ill and died. Her body was washed for burial and laid in an upstairs room.
44Ac 9:38 But the believers�� had heard that Peter was nearby at Lydda, so they sent two men to beg him, "Please come as soon as possible!" / ��Greek disciples
44Ac 9:39 So Peter returned with them; and as soon as he arrived, they took him to the upstairs room. The room was filled with widows who were weeping and showing him the coats and other clothes Dorcas had made for them.
44Ac 9:40 But Peter asked them all to leave the room; then he knelt and prayed. Turning to the body he said, "Get up, Tabitha." And she opened her eyes! When she saw Peter, she sat up!
44Ac 9:41 He gave her his hand and helped her up. Then he called in the widows and all the believers, and he presented her to them alive.
44Ac 9:42 The news spread through the whole town, and many believed in the Lord.
44Ac 9:43 And Peter stayed a long time in Joppa, living with Simon, a tanner of hides.
44Ac 10:1 In Caesarea there lived a Roman army officer�� named Cornelius, who was a captain of the Italian Regiment. / ��Greek a centurion
44Ac 10:2 He was a devout, God-fearing man, as was everyone in his household. He gave generously to the poor and prayed regularly to God.
44Ac 10:3 One afternoon about three o'clock, he had a vision in which he saw an angel of God coming toward him. "Cornelius!" the angel said.
44Ac 10:4 Cornelius stared at him in terror. "What is it, sir?" he asked the angelAnd the angel replied, "Your prayers and gifts to the poor have been received by God as an offering!
44Ac 10:5 Now send some men to Joppa, and summon a man named Simon Peter.
44Ac 10:6 He is staying with Simon, a tanner who lives near the seashore."
44Ac 10:7 As soon as the angel was gone, Cornelius called two of his household servants and a devout soldier, one of his personal attendants.
44Ac 10:8 He told them what had happened and sent them off to Joppa.
44Ac 10:9 The next day as Cornelius's messengers were nearing the town, Peter went up on the flat roof to pray. It was about noon,
44Ac 10:10 and he was hungry. But while a meal was being prepared, he fell into a trance.
44Ac 10:11 He saw the sky open, and something like a large sheet was let down by its four corners.
44Ac 10:12 In the sheet were all sorts of animals, reptiles, and birds.
44Ac 10:13 Then a voice said to him, "Get up, Peter; kill and eat them."
44Ac 10:14 "No, Lord," Peter declared. "I have never eaten anything that our Jewish laws have declared impure and unclean��." / ��Greek anything common and unclean
44Ac 10:15 But the voice spoke again�� "Do not call something unclean if God has made it clean."
44Ac 10:16 The same vision was repeated three times. Then the sheet was suddenly pulled up to heaven.
44Ac 10:17 Peter was very perplexed. What could the vision mean? Just then the men sent by Cornelius found Simon's house. Standing outside the gate,
44Ac 10:18 they asked if a man named Simon Peter was staying there.
44Ac 10:19 Meanwhile, as Peter was puzzling over the vision, the Holy Spirit said to him, "Three men have come looking for you.
44Ac 10:20 Get up, go downstairs, and go with them without hesitation. Don't worry, for I have sent them."
44Ac 10:21 So Peter went down and said, "I'm the man you are looking for. Why have you come?"
44Ac 10:22 They said, "We were sent by Cornelius, a Roman officer. He is a devout and God-fearing man, well respected by all the Jews. A holy angel instructed him to summon you to his house so that he can hear your message."
44Ac 10:23 So Peter invited the men to stay for the night. The next day he went with them, accompanied by some of the brothers from Joppa.
44Ac 10:24 They arrived in Caesarea the following day. Cornelius was waiting for them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
44Ac 10:25 As Peter entered his home, Cornelius fell at his feet and worshiped him.
44Ac 10:26 But Peter pulled him up and said, "Stand up! I'm a human being just like you!"
44Ac 10:27 So they talked together and went inside, where many others were assembled.
44Ac 10:28 Peter told them, "You know it is against our laws for a Jewish man to enter a Gentile home like this or to associate with you. But God has shown me that I should no longer think of anyone as impure or unclean.
44Ac 10:29 So I came without objection as soon as I was sent for. Now tell me why you sent for me."
44Ac 10:30 Cornelius replied, "Four days ago I was praying in my house about this same time, three o'clock in the afternoon. Suddenly, a man in dazzling clothes was standing in front of me.
44Ac 10:31 He told me, `Cornelius, your prayer has been heard, and your gifts to the poor have been noticed by God!
44Ac 10:32 Now send messengers to Joppa, and summon a man named Simon Peter. He is staying in the home of Simon, a tanner who lives near the seashore.'
44Ac 10:33 So I sent for you at once, and it was good of you to come. Now we are all here, waiting before God to hear the message the Lord has given you."
44Ac 10:34 Then Peter replied, "I see very clearly that God shows no favoritism.
44Ac 10:35 In every nation he accepts those who fear him and do what is right.
44Ac 10:36 This is the message of Good News for the people of Israel?that there is peace with God through Jesus Christ, who is Lord of all.
44Ac 10:37 You know what happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee, after John began preaching his message of baptism.
44Ac 10:38 And you know that God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. Then Jesus went around doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
44Ac 10:39 "And we apostles are witnesses of all he did throughout Judea and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a cross��, / ��Greek on a tree
44Ac 10:40 but God raised him to life on the third day. Then God allowed him to appear,
44Ac 10:41 not to the general public��, but to us whom God had chosen in advance to be his witnesses. We were those who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. / ��Greek the people
44Ac 10:42 And he ordered us to preach everywhere and to testify that Jesus is the one appointed by God to be the judge of all?the living and the dead.
44Ac 10:43 He is the one all the prophets testified about, saying that everyone who believes in him will have their sins forgiven through his name."
44Ac 10:44 Even as Peter was saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell upon all who were listening to the message.
44Ac 10:45 The Jewish believers�� who came with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the Gentiles, too. / ��Greek The faithful ones of the circumcision
44Ac 10:46 For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising GodThen Peter asked,
44Ac 10:47 "Can anyone object to their being baptized, now that they have received the Holy Spirit just as we did?"
44Ac 10:48 So he gave orders for them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Afterward Cornelius asked him to stay with them for several days.
44Ac 11:1 Soon the news reached the apostles and other believers�� in Judea that the Gentiles had received the word of God. / ��Greek brothers
44Ac 11:2 But when Peter arrived back in Jerusalem, the Jewish believers�� criticized him. / ��Greek those of the circumcision
44Ac 11:3 "You entered the home of Gentiles�� and even ate with them!" they said. / ��Greek of uncircumcised men
44Ac 11:4 Then Peter told them exactly what had happened.
44Ac 11:5 "I was in the town of Joppa," he said, "and while I was praying, I went into a trance and saw a vision. Something like a large sheet was let down by its four corners from the sky. And it came right down to me.
44Ac 11:6 When I looked inside the sheet, I saw all sorts of small animals, wild animals, reptiles, and birds.
44Ac 11:7 And I heard a voice say, `Get up, Peter; kill and eat them.'
44Ac 11:8 "`No, Lord,' I replied. `I have never eaten anything that our Jewish laws have declared impure or unclean��.' / ��Greek anything common or unclean
44Ac 11:9 "But the voice from heaven spoke again�� `Do not call something unclean if God has made it clean.'
44Ac 11:10 This happened three times before the sheet and all it contained was pulled back up to heaven.
44Ac 11:11 "Just then three men who had been sent from Caesarea arrived at the house where we were staying.
44Ac 11:12 The Holy Spirit told me to go with them and not to worry that they were Gentiles. These six brothers here accompanied me, and we soon entered the home of the man who had sent for us.
44Ac 11:13 He told us how an angel had appeared to him in his home and had told him, `Send messengers to Joppa, and summon a man named Simon Peter.
44Ac 11:14 He will tell you how you and everyone in your household can be saved!'
44Ac 11:15 "As I began to speak," Peter continued, "the Holy Spirit fell on them, just as he fell on us at the beginning.
44Ac 11:16 Then I thought of the Lord's words when he said, `John baptized with�� water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.' / ��Or in; also in 11.16b
44Ac 11:17 And since God gave these Gentiles the same gift he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I to stand in God's way?"
44Ac 11:18 When the others heard this, they stopped objecting and began praising God. They said, "We can see that God has also given the Gentiles the privilege of repenting of their sins and receiving eternal life."
44Ac 11:19 Meanwhile, the believers who had been scattered during the persecution after Stephen's death traveled as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch of Syria. They preached the word of God, but only to Jews.
44Ac 11:20 However, some of the believers who went to Antioch from Cyprus and Cyrene began preaching to the Gentiles�� about the Lord Jesus. / ��Greek the Hellenists (i.e., those who speak Greek); other manuscripts read the Greeks
44Ac 11:21 The power of the Lord was with them, and a large number of these Gentiles believed and turned to the Lord.
44Ac 11:22 When the church at Jerusalem heard what had happened, they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
44Ac 11:23 When he arrived and saw this evidence of God's blessing, he was filled with joy, and he encouraged the believers to stay true to the Lord.
44Ac 11:24 Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and strong in faith. And many people were brought to the Lord.
44Ac 11:25 Then Barnabas went on to Tarsus to look for Saul.
44Ac 11:26 When he found him, he brought him back to Antioch. Both of them stayed there with the church for a full year, teaching large crowds of people. (It was at Antioch that the believers�� were first called Christians.) / ��Greek disciples; also in 11.29
44Ac 11:27 During this time some prophets traveled from Jerusalem to Antioch.
44Ac 11:28 One of them named Agabus stood up in one of the meetings and predicted by the Spirit that a great famine was coming upon the entire Roman world. (This was fulfilled during the reign of Claudius.)
44Ac 11:29 So the believers in Antioch decided to send relief to the brothers and sisters�� in Judea, everyone giving as much as they could. / ��Greek the brothers
44Ac 11:30 This they did, entrusting their gifts to Barnabas and Saul to take to the elders of the church in Jerusalem.
44Ac 12:1 About that time King Herod Agrippa�� began to persecute some believers in the church. / ��Greek Herod the king. He was the nephew of Herod Antipas and a grandson of Herod the Great
44Ac 12:2 He had the apostle James �� killed with a sword. / ��John's brother
44Ac 12:3 When Herod saw how much this pleased the Jewish people, he also arrested Peter. (This took place during the Passover celebration��.) / ��Greek the days of unleavened bread
44Ac 12:4 Then he imprisoned him, placing him under the guard of four squads of four soldiers each. Herod intended to bring Peter out for public trial after the Passover.
44Ac 12:5 But while Peter was in prison, the church prayed very earnestly for him.
44Ac 12:6 The night before Peter was to be placed on trial, he was asleep, fastened with two chains between two soldiers. Others stood guard at the prison gate.
44Ac 12:7 Suddenly, there was a bright light in the cell, and an angel of the Lord stood before Peter. The angel struck him on the side to awaken him and said, "Quick! Get up!" And the chains fell off his wrists.
44Ac 12:8 Then the angel told him, "Get dressed and put on your sandals." And he did. "Now put on your coat and follow me," the angel ordered.
44Ac 12:9 So Peter left the cell, following the angel. But all the time he thought it was a vision. He didn't realize it was actually happening.
44Ac 12:10 They passed the first and second guard posts and came to the iron gate leading to the city, and this opened for them all by itself. So they passed through and started walking down the street, and then the angel suddenly left him.
44Ac 12:11 Peter finally came to his senses. "It's really true!" he said. "The Lord has sent his angel and saved me from Herod and from what the Jewish leaders�� had planned to do to me!" / ��Or the Jewish people
44Ac 12:12 When he realized this, he went to the home of Mary, the mother of John Mark, where many were gathered for prayer.
44Ac 12:13 He knocked at the door in the gate, and a servant girl named Rhoda came to open it.
44Ac 12:14 When she recognized Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that, instead of opening the door, she ran back inside and told everyone, "Peter is standing at the door!"
44Ac 12:15 "You're out of your mind!" they said. When she insisted, they decided, "It must be his angel."
44Ac 12:16 Meanwhile, Peter continued knocking. When they finally opened the door and saw him, they were amazed.
44Ac 12:17 He motioned for them to quiet down and told them how the Lord had led him out of prison. "Tell James and the other brothers what happened," he said. And then he went to another place.
44Ac 12:18 At dawn there was a great commotion among the soldiers about what had happened to Peter.
44Ac 12:19 Herod Agrippa ordered a thorough search for him. When he couldn't be found, Herod interrogated the guards and sentenced them to death. Afterward Herod left Judea to stay in Caesarea for a while.
44Ac 12:20 Now Herod was very angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they sent a delegation to make peace with him because their cities were dependent upon Herod's country for food. The delegates won the support of Blastus, Herod's personal assistant,
44Ac 12:21 and an appointment with Herod was granted. When the day arrived, Herod put on his royal robes, sat on his throne, and made a speech to them.
44Ac 12:22 The people gave him a great ovation, shouting, "It's the voice of a god, not of a man!"
44Ac 12:23 Instantly, an angel of the Lord struck Herod with a sickness, because he accepted the people's worship instead of giving the glory to God. So he was consumed with worms and died.
44Ac 12:24 Meanwhile, the word of God continued to spread, and there were many new believers.
44Ac 12:25 When Barnabas and Saul had finished their mission to Jerusalem, they returned��, taking John Mark with them. / ��Or mission, they returned to Jerusalem. Other manuscripts read mission, they returned from Jerusalem; still others read mission, they returned from Jerusalem to Antioch
44Ac 13:1 Among the prophets and teachers of the church at Antioch of Syria were Barnabas, Simeon (called "the black man"��), Lucius (from Cyrene), Manaen (the childhood companion of King Herod Antipas��), and Saul. / ��Greek who was called Niger ��Greek Herod the tetrarch
44Ac 13:2 One day as these men were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Dedicate Barnabas and Saul for the special work to which I have called them."
44Ac 13:3 So after more fasting and prayer, the men laid their hands on them and sent them on their way.
44Ac 13:4 So Barnabas and Saul were sent out by the Holy Spirit. They went down to the seaport of Seleucia and then sailed for the island of Cyprus.
44Ac 13:5 There, in the town of Salamis, they went to the Jewish synagogues and preached the word of God. John Mark went with them as their assistant.
44Ac 13:6 Afterward they traveled from town to town across the entire island until finally they reached Paphos, where they met a Jewish sorcerer, a false prophet named Bar-Jesus.
44Ac 13:7 He had attached himself to the governor, Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. The governor invited Barnabas and Saul to visit him, for he wanted to hear the word of God.
44Ac 13:8 But Elymas, the sorcerer (as his name means in Greek), interfered and urged the governor to pay no attention to what Barnabas and Saul said. He was trying to keep the governor from believing.
44Ac 13:9 Saul, also known as Paul, was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he looked the sorcerer in the eye.
44Ac 13:10 Then he said, "You son of the devil, full of every sort of deceit and fraud, and enemy of all that is good! Will you never stop perverting the true ways of the Lord?
44Ac 13:11 Watch now, for the Lord has laid his hand of punishment upon you, and you will be struck blind. You will not see the sunlight for some time." Instantly mist and darkness came over the man's eyes, and he began groping around begging for someone to take his hand and lead him.
44Ac 13:12 When the governor saw what had happened, he became a believer, for he was astonished at the teaching about the Lord.
44Ac 13:13 Paul and his companions then left Paphos by ship for Pamphylia, landing at the port town of Perga. There John Mark left them and returned to Jerusalem.
44Ac 13:14 But Paul and Barnabas traveled inland to Antioch of Pisidia��. On the Sabbath they went to the synagogue for the services. / ��Pamphylia and Pisidia were districts in what is now Turkey
44Ac 13:15 After the usual readings from the books of Moses�� and the prophets, those in charge of the service sent them this message�� "Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, come and give it." / ��Greek from the law
44Ac 13:16 So Paul stood, lifted his hand to quiet them, and started speaking. "Men of Israel," he said, "and you God-fearing Gentiles, listen to me.
44Ac 13:17 "The God of this nation of Israel chose our ancestors and made them multiply and grow strong during their stay in Egypt. Then with a powerful arm he led them out of their slavery.
44Ac 13:18 He put up with them�� through forty years of wandering in the wilderness. / ��Some manuscripts read He cared for them; compare Deut 1.31
44Ac 13:19 Then he destroyed seven nations in Canaan and gave their land to Israel as an inheritance.
44Ac 13:20 All this took about 450 years"After that, God gave them judges to rule until the time of Samuel the prophet.
44Ac 13:21 Then the people begged for a king, and God gave them Saul son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, who reigned for forty years.
44Ac 13:22 But God removed Saul and replaced him with David, a man about whom God said, `I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart. He will do everything I want him to do.'�� / ��1 Sam 13.14
44Ac 13:23 "And it is one of King David's descendants, Jesus, who is God's promised Savior of Israel!
44Ac 13:24 Before he came, John the Baptist preached that all the people of Israel needed to repent of their sins and turn to God and be baptized.
44Ac 13:25 As John was finishing his ministry he asked, `Do you think I am the Messiah? No, I am not! But he is coming soon?and I'm not even worthy to be his slave and untie the sandals on his feet.'
44Ac 13:26 "Brothers?you sons of Abraham, and also you God-fearing Gentiles?this message of salvation has been sent to us!
44Ac 13:27 The people in Jerusalem and their leaders did not recognize Jesus as the one the prophets had spoken about. Instead, they condemned him, and in doing this they fulfilled the prophets' words that are read every Sabbath.
44Ac 13:28 They found no legal reason to execute him, but they asked Pilate to have him killed anyway.
44Ac 13:29 "When they had done all that the prophecies said about him, they took him down from the cross�� and placed him in a tomb. / ��Greek from the tree
44Ac 13:30 But God raised him from the dead!
44Ac 13:31 And over a period of many days he appeared to those who had gone with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to the people of Israel.
44Ac 13:32 "And now we are here to bring you this Good News. The promise was made to our ancestors,
44Ac 13:33 and God has now fulfilled it for us, their descendants, by raising Jesus. This is what the second psalm says about Jesus�� `You are my Son Today I have become your Father.��' / ��Or Today I reveal you as my Son. Ps 2.7
44Ac 13:34 For God had promised to raise him from the dead, not leaving him to rot in the grave. He said, `I will give you the sacred blessings I promised to David.'�� / ��Isa 55.3
44Ac 13:35 Another psalm explains it more fully�� `You will not allow your Holy One to rot in the grave.'�� / ��Ps 16.10
44Ac 13:36 This is not a reference to David, for after David had done the will of God in his own generation, he died and was buried with his ancestors, and his body decayed.
44Ac 13:37 No, it was a reference to someone else?someone whom God raised and whose body did not decay.
44Ac 13:38 ��"Brothers, listen! We are here to proclaim that through this man Jesus there is forgiveness for your sins. / ��English translations divide verses 38 and 39 in various ways
44Ac 13:39 Everyone who believes in him is declared right with God?something the law of Moses could never do.
44Ac 13:40 Be careful! Don't let the prophets' words apply to you. For they said,
44Ac 13:41 `Look, you mockers, be amazed and die! For I am doing something in your own day, something you wouldn't believe even if someone told you about it.'��" / ��Hab 1.5 (Greek version)
44Ac 13:42 As Paul and Barnabas left the synagogue that day, the people begged them to speak about these things again the next week.
44Ac 13:43 Many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, and the two men urged them to continue to rely on the grace of God.
44Ac 13:44 The following week almost the entire city turned out to hear them preach the word of the Lord.
44Ac 13:45 But when some of the Jews saw the crowds, they were jealous; so they slandered Paul and argued against whatever he said.
44Ac 13:46 Then Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly and declared, "It was necessary that we first preach the word of God to you Jews. But since you have rejected it and judged yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we will offer it to the Gentiles.
44Ac 13:47 For the Lord gave us this command when he said, `I have made you a light to the Gentiles, to bring salvation to the farthest corners of the earth.'��" / ��Isa 49.6
44Ac 13:48 When the Gentiles heard this, they were very glad and thanked the Lord for his message; and all who were chosen for eternal life became believers.
44Ac 13:49 So the Lord's message spread throughout that region.
44Ac 13:50 Then the Jews stirred up the influential religious women and the leaders of the city, and they incited a mob against Paul and Barnabas and ran them out of town.
44Ac 13:51 So they shook the dust from their feet as a sign of rejection and went to the town of Iconium.
44Ac 13:52 And the believers�� were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. / ��Greek the disciples
44Ac 14:1 The same thing happened in Iconium��. Paul and Barnabas went to the Jewish synagogue and preached with such power that a great number of both Jews and Greeks became believers. / ��Iconium, as well as Lystra and Derbe (14.6), were towns in what is now Turkey
44Ac 14:2 Some of the Jews, however, spurned God's message and poisoned the minds of the Gentiles against Paul and Barnabas.
44Ac 14:3 But the apostles stayed there a long time, preaching boldly about the grace of the Lord. And the Lord proved their message was true by giving them power to do miraculous signs and wonders.
44Ac 14:4 But the people of the town were divided in their opinion about them. Some sided with the Jews, and some with the apostles.
44Ac 14:5 Then a mob of Gentiles and Jews, along with their leaders, decided to attack and stone them.
44Ac 14:6 When the apostles learned of it, they fled to the region of Lycaonia?to the towns of Lystra and Derbe and the surrounding area.
44Ac 14:7 And there they preached the Good News.
44Ac 14:8 While they were at Lystra, Paul and Barnabas came upon a man with crippled feet. He had been that way from birth, so he had never walked. He was sitting
44Ac 14:9 and listening as Paul preached. Looking straight at him, Paul realized he had faith to be healed.
44Ac 14:10 So Paul called to him in a loud voice, "Stand up!" And the man jumped to his feet and started walking.
44Ac 14:11 When the crowd saw what Paul had done, they shouted in their local dialect, "These men are gods in human form!"
44Ac 14:12 They decided that Barnabas was the Greek god Zeus and that Paul was Hermes, since he was the chief speaker.
44Ac 14:13 Now the temple of Zeus was located just outside the town. So the priest of the temple and the crowd brought bulls and wreaths of flowers to the town gates, and they prepared to offer sacrifices to the apostles.
44Ac 14:14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard what was happening, they tore their clothing in dismay and ran out among the people, shouting,
44Ac 14:15 "Friends��, why are you doing this? We are merely human beings-just like you! We have come to bring you the Good News that you should turn from these worthless things and turn to the living God, who made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them. / ��Greek Men
44Ac 14:16 In the past he permitted all the nations to go their own ways,
44Ac 14:17 but he never left them without evidence of himself and his goodness. For instance, he sends you rain and good crops and gives you food and joyful hearts."
44Ac 14:18 But even with these words, Paul and Barnabas could scarcely restrain the people from sacrificing to them.
44Ac 14:19 Then some Jews arrived from Antioch and Iconium and won the crowds to their side. They stoned Paul and dragged him out of town, thinking he was dead.
44Ac 14:20 But as the believers�� gathered around him, he got up and went back into the town. The next day he left with Barnabas for Derbe. / ��Greek disciples; also in 14.22, 28
44Ac 14:21 After preaching the Good News in Derbe and making many disciples, Paul and Barnabas returned to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch of Pisidia,
44Ac 14:22 where they strengthened the believers. They encouraged them to continue in the faith, reminding them that we must suffer many hardships to enter the Kingdom of God.
44Ac 14:23 Paul and Barnabas also appointed elders in every church. With prayer and fasting, they turned the elders over to the care of the Lord, in whom they had put their trust.
44Ac 14:24 Then they traveled back through Pisidia to Pamphylia.
44Ac 14:25 They preached the word in Perga, then went down to Attalia.
44Ac 14:26 Finally, they returned by ship to Antioch of Syria, where their journey had begun. The believers there had entrusted them to the grace of God to do the work they had now completed.
44Ac 14:27 Upon arriving in Antioch, they called the church together and reported everything God had done through them and how he had opened the door of faith to the Gentiles, too.
44Ac 14:28 And they stayed there with the believers for a long time.
44Ac 15:1 While Paul and Barnabas were at Antioch of Syria, some men from Judea arrived and began to teach the believers�磺 "Unless you are circumcised as required by the law of Moses, you cannot be saved." / ��Greek brothers; also in 15.3, 23, 32, 33, 36, 40
44Ac 15:2 Paul and Barnabas disagreed with them, arguing vehemently. Finally, the church decided to send Paul and Barnabas to Jerusalem, accompanied by some local believers, to talk to the apostles and elders about this question.
44Ac 15:3 The church sent the delegates to Jerusalem, and they stopped along the way in Phoenicia and Samaria to visit the believers. They told them?much to everyone's joy?that the Gentiles, too, were being converted.
44Ac 15:4 When they arrived in Jerusalem, Barnabas and Paul were welcomed by the whole church, including the apostles and elders. They reported everything God had done through them.
44Ac 15:5 But then some of the believers who belonged to the sect of the Pharisees stood up and insisted, "The Gentile converts must be circumcised and required to follow the law of Moses."
44Ac 15:6 So the apostles and elders met together to resolve this issue.
44Ac 15:7 At the meeting, after a long discussion, Peter stood and addressed them as follows�� "Brothers, you all know that God chose me from among you some time ago to preach to the Gentiles so that they could hear the Good News and believe.
44Ac 15:8 God knows people's hearts, and he confirmed that he accepts Gentiles by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us.
44Ac 15:9 He made no distinction between us and them, for he cleansed their hearts through faith.
44Ac 15:10 So why are you now challenging God by burdening the Gentile believers�� with a yoke that neither we nor our ancestors were able to bear? / ��Greek disciples
44Ac 15:11 We believe that we are all saved the same way, by the undeserved grace of the Lord Jesus."
44Ac 15:12 Everyone listened quietly as Barnabas and Paul told about the miraculous signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
44Ac 15:13 When they had finished, James stood and said, "Brothers, listen to me.
44Ac 15:14 Peter�� has told you about the time God first visited the Gentiles to take from them a people for himself. / ��Greek Symeon
44Ac 15:15 And this conversion of Gentiles is exactly what the prophets predicted. As it is written.
44Ac 15:16 `Afterward I will return and restore the fallen house�� of David. I will rebuild its ruins and restore it, / ��Or kingdom; Greek reads tent
44Ac 15:17 so that the rest of humanity might seek the LORD, including the Gentiles? all those I have called to be mine. The LORD has spoken?
44Ac 15:18 he who made these things known so long ago.'�� / ��Amos 9.11-12 (Greek version); Isa 45.21
44Ac 15:19 "And so my judgment is that we should not make it difficult for the Gentiles who are turning to God.
44Ac 15:20 Instead, we should write and tell them to abstain from eating food offered to idols, from sexual immorality, from eating the meat of strangled animals, and from consuming blood.
44Ac 15:21 For these laws of Moses have been preached in Jewish synagogues in every city on every Sabbath for many generations."
44Ac 15:22 Then the apostles and elders together with the whole church in Jerusalem chose delegates, and they sent them to Antioch of Syria with Paul and Barnabas to report on this decision. The men chosen were two of the church leaders�� - Judas (also called Barsabbas) and Silas. / ��Greek were leaders among the brothers
44Ac 15:23 This is the letter they took with them�� "This letter is from the apostles and elders, your brothers in Jerusalem. It is written to the Gentile believers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. Greetings!
44Ac 15:24 "We understand that some men from here have troubled you and upset you with their teaching, but we did not send them!
44Ac 15:25 So we decided, having come to complete agreement, to send you official representatives, along with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
44Ac 15:26 who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44Ac 15:27 We are sending Judas and Silas to confirm what we have decided concerning your question.
44Ac 15:28 "For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay no greater burden on you than these few requirements.
44Ac 15:29 You must abstain from eating food offered to idols, from consuming blood or the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality. If you do this, you will do well. Farewell."
44Ac 15:30 The messengers went at once to Antioch, where they called a general meeting of the believers and delivered the letter.
44Ac 15:31 And there was great joy throughout the church that day as they read this encouraging message.
44Ac 15:32 Then Judas and Silas, both being prophets, spoke at length to the believers, encouraging and strengthening their faith.
44Ac 15:33 They stayed for a while, and then the believers sent them back to the church in Jerusalem with a blessing of peace.
44Ac 15:34 �� / ��Some manuscripts add verse 34, But Silas decided to stay there.
44Ac 15:35 Paul and Barnabas stayed in Antioch. They and many others taught and preached the word of the Lord there.
44Ac 15:36 After some time Paul said to Barnabas, "Let's go back and visit each city where we previously preached the word of the Lord, to see how the new believers are doing."
44Ac 15:37 Barnabas agreed and wanted to take along John Mark.
44Ac 15:38 But Paul disagreed strongly, since John Mark had deserted them in Pamphylia and had not continued with them in their work.
44Ac 15:39 Their disagreement was so sharp that they separated. Barnabas took John Mark with him and sailed for Cyprus.
44Ac 15:40 Paul chose Silas, and as he left, the believers entrusted him to the Lord's gracious care.
44Ac 15:41 Then he traveled throughout Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches there.
44Ac 16:1 Paul went first to Derbe and then to Lystra, where there was a young disciple named Timothy. His mother was a Jewish believer, but his father was a Greek.
44Ac 16:2 Timothy was well thought of by the believers�� in Lystra and Iconium, / ��Greek brothers; also in 16.40
44Ac 16:3 so Paul wanted him to join them on their journey. In deference to the Jews of the area, he arranged for Timothy to be circumcised before they left, for everyone knew that his father was a Greek.
44Ac 16:4 Then they went from town to town, instructing the believers to follow the decisions made by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem.
44Ac 16:5 So the churches were strengthened in their faith and grew larger every day.
44Ac 16:6 Next Paul and Silas traveled through the area of Phrygia and Galatia, because the Holy Spirit had prevented them from preaching the word in the province of Asia at that time.
44Ac 16:7 Then coming to the borders of Mysia, they headed north for the province of Bithynia��, but again the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them to go there. / ��Phrygia, Galatia, Asia, Mysia, and Bithynia were all districts in what is now Turkey
44Ac 16:8 So instead, they went on through Mysia to the seaport of Troas.
44Ac 16:9 That night Paul had a vision�� A man from Macedonia in northern Greece was standing there, pleading with him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us!"
44Ac 16:10 So we�� decided to leave for Macedonia at once, having concluded that God was calling us to preach the Good News there. / ��Luke, the writer of this book, here joined Paul and accompanied him on his journey
44Ac 16:11 We boarded a boat at Troas and sailed straight across to the island of Samothrace, and the next day we landed at Neapolis.
44Ac 16:12 From there we reached Philippi, a major city of that district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. And we stayed there several days.
44Ac 16:13 On the Sabbath we went a little way outside the city to a riverbank, where we thought people would be meeting for prayer, and we sat down to speak with some women who had gathered there.
44Ac 16:14 One of them was Lydia from Thyatira, a merchant of expensive purple cloth, who worshiped God. As she listened to us, the Lord opened her heart, and she accepted what Paul was saying.
44Ac 16:15 She was baptized along with other members of her household, and she asked us to be her guests. "If you agree that I am a true believer in the Lord," she said, "come and stay at my home." And she urged us until we agreed.
44Ac 16:16 One day as we were going down to the place of prayer, we met a demon-possessed slave girl. She was a fortune-teller who earned a lot of money for her masters.
44Ac 16:17 She followed Paul and the rest of us, shouting, "These men are servants of the Most High God, and they have come to tell you how to be saved."
44Ac 16:18 This went on day after day until Paul got so exasperated that he turned and said to the demon within her, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And instantly it left her.
44Ac 16:19 Her masters' hopes of wealth were now shattered, so they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities at the marketplace.
44Ac 16:20 "The whole city is in an uproar because of these Jews!" they shouted to the city officials.
44Ac 16:21 "They are teaching customs that are illegal for us Romans to practice."
44Ac 16:22 A mob quickly formed against Paul and Silas, and the city officials ordered them stripped and beaten with wooden rods.
44Ac 16:23 They were severely beaten, and then they were thrown into prison. The jailer was ordered to make sure they didn't escape.
44Ac 16:24 So the jailer put them into the inner dungeon and clamped their feet in the stocks.
44Ac 16:25 Around midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening.
44Ac 16:26 Suddenly, there was a massive earthquake, and the prison was shaken to its foundations. All the doors immediately flew open, and the chains of every prisoner fell off!
44Ac 16:27 The jailer woke up to see the prison doors wide open. He assumed the prisoners had escaped, so he drew his sword to kill himself.
44Ac 16:28 But Paul shouted to him, "Stop! Don't kill yourself! We are all here!"
44Ac 16:29 The jailer called for lights and ran to the dungeon and fell down trembling before Paul and Silas.
44Ac 16:30 Then he brought them out and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44Ac 16:31 They replied, "Believe in the Lord Jesus and you will be saved, along with everyone in your household."
44Ac 16:32 And they shared the word of the Lord with him and with all who lived in his household.
44Ac 16:33 Even at that hour of the night, the jailer cared for them and washed their wounds. Then he and everyone in his household were immediately baptized.
44Ac 16:34 He brought them into his house and set a meal before them, and he and his entire household rejoiced because they all believed in God.
44Ac 16:35 The next morning the city officials sent the police to tell the jailer, "Let those men go!"
44Ac 16:36 So the jailer told Paul, "The city officials have said you and Silas are free to leave. Go in peace."
44Ac 16:37 But Paul replied, "They have publicly beaten us without a trial and put us in prison?and we are Roman citizens. So now they want us to leave secretly? Certainly not! Let them come themselves to release us!"
44Ac 16:38 When the police reported this, the city officials were alarmed to learn that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens.
44Ac 16:39 So they came to the jail and apologized to them. Then they brought them out and begged them to leave the city.
44Ac 16:40 When Paul and Silas left the prison, they returned to the home of Lydia. There they met with the believers and encouraged them once more. Then they left town.
44Ac 17:1 Paul and Silas then traveled through the towns of Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
44Ac 17:2 As was Paul's custom, he went to the synagogue service, and for three Sabbaths in a row he used the Scriptures to reason with the people.
44Ac 17:3 He explained the prophecies and proved that the Messiah must suffer and rise from the dead. He said, "This Jesus I'm telling you about is the Messiah."
44Ac 17:4 Some of the Jews who listened were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, along with many God-fearing Greek men and quite a few prominent women��. / ��Some manuscripts read quite a few of the wives of the leading men
44Ac 17:5 But some of the Jews were jealous, so they gathered some troublemakers from the marketplace to form a mob and start a riot. They attacked the home of Jason, searching for Paul and Silas so they could drag them out to the crowd��. / ��Or the city council
44Ac 17:6 Not finding them there, they dragged out Jason and some of the other believers�� instead and took them before the city council. "Paul and Silas have caused trouble all over the world," they shouted, "and now they are here disturbing our city, too. / ��Greek brothers; also in 17.10, 14
44Ac 17:7 And Jason has welcomed them into his home. They are all guilty of treason against Caesar, for they profess allegiance to another king, named Jesus."
44Ac 17:8 The people of the city, as well as the city council, were thrown into turmoil by these reports.
44Ac 17:9 So the officials forced Jason and the other believers to post bond, and then they released them.
44Ac 17:10 That very night the believers sent Paul and Silas to Berea. When they arrived there, they went to the Jewish synagogue.
44Ac 17:11 And the people of Berea were more open-minded than those in Thessalonica, and they listened eagerly to Paul's message. They searched the Scriptures day after day to see if Paul and Silas were teaching the truth.
44Ac 17:12 As a result, many Jews believed, as did many of the prominent Greek women and men.
44Ac 17:13 But when some Jews in Thessalonica learned that Paul was preaching the word of God in Berea, they went there and stirred up trouble.
44Ac 17:14 The believers acted at once, sending Paul on to the coast, while Silas and Timothy remained behind.
44Ac 17:15 Those escorting Paul went with him all the way to Athens; then they returned to Berea with instructions for Silas and Timothy to hurry and join him.
44Ac 17:16 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, he was deeply troubled by all the idols he saw everywhere in the city.
44Ac 17:17 He went to the synagogue to reason with the Jews and the God-fearing Gentiles, and he spoke daily in the public square to all who happened to be there.
44Ac 17:18 He also had a debate with some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers. When he told them about Jesus and his resurrection, they said, "What's this babbler trying to say with these strange ideas he's picked up?" Others said, "He seems to be preaching about some foreign gods."
44Ac 17:19 Then they took him to the high council of the city��. "Come and tell us about this new teaching," they said. / ��Or the most learned society of philosophers in the city. Greek reads the Areopagus
44Ac 17:20 "You are saying some rather strange things, and we want to know what it's all about."
44Ac 17:21 (It should be explained that all the Athenians as well as the foreigners in Athens seemed to spend all their time discussing the latest ideas.)
44Ac 17:22 So Paul, standing before the council��, addressed them as follows�� "Men of Athens, I notice that you are very religious in every way, / ��Traditionally rendered standing in the middle of Mars Hill; Greek reads standing in the middle of the Areopagus
44Ac 17:23 for as I was walking along I saw your many shrines. And one of your altars had this inscription on it�� `To an Unknown God.' This God, whom you worship without knowing, is the one I'm telling you about.
44Ac 17:24 "He is the God who made the world and everything in it. Since he is Lord of heaven and earth, he doesn't live in man-made temples,
44Ac 17:25 and human hands can't serve his needs?for he has no needs. He himself gives life and breath to everything, and he satisfies every need.
44Ac 17:26 From one man�� he created all the nations throughout the whole earth. He decided beforehand when they should rise and fall, and he determined their boundaries. / ��Greek From one; other manuscripts read From one blood
44Ac 17:27 "His purpose was for the nations to seek after God and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him?though he is not far from any one of us.
44Ac 17:28 For in him we live and move and exist. As some of your�� own poets have said, `We are his offspring.' / ��Some manuscripts read our
44Ac 17:29 And since this is true, we shouldn't think of God as an idol designed by craftsmen from gold or silver or stone.
44Ac 17:30 "God overlooked people's ignorance about these things in earlier times, but now he commands everyone everywhere to repent of their sins and turn to him.
44Ac 17:31 For he has set a day for judging the world with justice by the man he has appointed, and he proved to everyone who this is by raising him from the dead."
44Ac 17:32 When they heard Paul speak about the resurrection of the dead, some laughed in contempt, but others said, "We want to hear more about this later."
44Ac 17:33 That ended Paul's discussion with them,
44Ac 17:34 but some joined him and became believers. Among them were Dionysius, a member of the council��, a woman named Damaris, and others with them. / ��Greek an Areopagite
44Ac 18:1 Then Paul left Athens and went to Corinth��. / ��Athens and Corinth were major cities in Achaia, the region in the southern portion of the Greek peninsula
44Ac 18:2 There he became acquainted with a Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, who had recently arrived from Italy with his wife, Priscilla. They had left Italy when Claudius Caesar deported all Jews from Rome.
44Ac 18:3 Paul lived and worked with them, for they were tentmakers�� just as he was. / ��Or leatherworkers
44Ac 18:4 Each Sabbath found Paul at the synagogue, trying to convince the Jews and Greeks alike.
44Ac 18:5 And after Silas and Timothy came down from Macedonia, Paul spent all his time preaching the word. He testified to the Jews that Jesus was the Messiah.
44Ac 18:6 But when they opposed and insulted him, Paul shook the dust from his clothes and said, "Your blood is upon your own heads?I am innocent. From now on I will go preach to the Gentiles."
44Ac 18:7 Then he left and went to the home of Titius Justus, a Gentile who worshiped God and lived next door to the synagogue.
44Ac 18:8 Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, and everyone in his household believed in the Lord. Many others in Corinth also heard Paul, became believers, and were baptized.
44Ac 18:9 One night the Lord spoke to Paul in a vision and told him, "Don't be afraid! Speak out! Don't be silent!
44Ac 18:10 For I am with you, and no one will attack and harm you, for many people in this city belong to me."
44Ac 18:11 So Paul stayed there for the next year and a half, teaching the word of God.
44Ac 18:12 But when Gallio became governor of Achaia, some Jews rose up together against Paul and brought him before the governor for judgment.
44Ac 18:13 They accused Paul of "persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to our law."
44Ac 18:14 But just as Paul started to make his defense, Gallio turned to Paul's accusers and said, "Listen, you Jews, if this were a case involving some wrongdoing or a serious crime, I would have a reason to accept your case.
44Ac 18:15 But since it is merely a question of words and names and your Jewish law, take care of it yourselves. I refuse to judge such matters."
44Ac 18:16 And he threw them out of the courtroom.
44Ac 18:17 The crowd�� then grabbed Sosthenes, the leader of the synagogue, and beat him right there in the courtroom. But Gallio paid no attention. / ��Greek Everyone; other manuscripts read All the Greeks
44Ac 18:18 Paul stayed in Corinth for some time after that, then said good-bye to the brothers and sisters�� and went to nearby Cenchrea. There he shaved his head according to Jewish custom, marking the end of a vow. Then he set sail for Syria, taking Priscilla and Aquila with him. / ��Greek brothers; also in 18.27
44Ac 18:19 They stopped first at the port of Ephesus, where Paul left the others behind. While he was there, he went to the synagogue to reason with the Jews.
44Ac 18:20 They asked him to stay longer, but he declined.
44Ac 18:21 As he left, however, he said, "I will come back later��, God willing." Then he set sail from Ephesus. / ��Some manuscripts read "I must by all means be at Jerusalem for the upcoming festival, but I will come back later."
44Ac 18:22 The next stop was at the port of Caesarea. From there he went up and visited the church at Jerusalem�� and then went back to Antioch. / ��Greek the church
44Ac 18:23 After spending some time in Antioch, Paul went back through Galatia and Phrygia, visiting and strengthening all the believers��. / ��Greek disciples; also in 18.27
44Ac 18:24 Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos, an eloquent speaker who knew the Scriptures well, had arrived in Ephesus from Alexandria in Egypt.
44Ac 18:25 He had been taught the way of the Lord, and he taught others about Jesus with an enthusiastic spirit�� and with accuracy. However, he knew only about John's baptism. / ��Or with enthusiasm in the Spirit
44Ac 18:26 When Priscilla and Aquila heard him preaching boldly in the synagogue, they took him aside and explained the way of God even more accurately.
44Ac 18:27 Apollos had been thinking about going to Achaia, and the brothers and sisters in Ephesus encouraged him to go. They wrote to the believers in Achaia, asking them to welcome him. When he arrived there, he proved to be of great benefit to those who, by God's grace, had believed.
44Ac 18:28 He refuted the Jews with powerful arguments in public debate. Using the Scriptures, he explained to them that Jesus was the Messiah.
44Ac 19:1 While Apollos was in Corinth, Paul traveled through the interior regions until he reached Ephesus, on the coast, where he found several believers��. / ��Greek disciples; also in 19.9, 30
44Ac 19:2 "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" he asked them"No," they replied, "we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
44Ac 19:3 "Then what baptism did you experience?" he askedAnd they replied, "The baptism of John."
44Ac 19:4 Paul said, "John's baptism called for repentance from sin. But John himself told the people to believe in the one who would come later, meaning Jesus."
44Ac 19:5 As soon as they heard this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 19:6 Then when Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spoke in other tongues and prophesied.
44Ac 19:7 There were about twelve men in all.
44Ac 19:8 Then Paul went to the synagogue and preached boldly for the next three months, arguing persuasively about the Kingdom of God.
44Ac 19:9 But some became stubborn, rejecting his message and publicly speaking against the Way. So Paul left the synagogue and took the believers with him. Then he held daily discussions at the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
44Ac 19:10 This went on for the next two years, so that people throughout the province of Asia?both Jews and Greeks?heard the word of the Lord.
44Ac 19:11 God gave Paul the power to perform unusual miracles.
44Ac 19:12 When handkerchiefs or aprons that had merely touched his skin were placed on sick people, they were healed of their diseases, and evil spirits were expelled.
44Ac 19:13 A group of Jews was traveling from town to town casting out evil spirits. They tried to use the name of the Lord Jesus in their incantation, saying, "I command you in the name of Jesus, whom Paul preaches, to come out!"
44Ac 19:14 Seven sons of Sceva, a leading priest, were doing this.
44Ac 19:15 But one time when they tried it, the evil spirit replied, "I know Jesus, and I know Paul, but who are you?"
44Ac 19:16 Then the man with the evil spirit leaped on them, overpowered them, and attacked them with such violence that they fled from the house, naked and battered.
44Ac 19:17 The story of what happened spread quickly all through Ephesus, to Jews and Greeks alike. A solemn fear descended on the city, and the name of the Lord Jesus was greatly honored.
44Ac 19:18 Many who became believers confessed their sinful practices.
44Ac 19:19 A number of them who had been practicing sorcery brought their incantation books and burned them at a public bonfire. The value of the books was several million dollars��. / ��Greek 50,000 pieces of silver, each of which was the equivalent of a day's wage
44Ac 19:20 So the message about the Lord spread widely and had a powerful effect.
44Ac 19:21 Afterward Paul felt compelled by the Spirit�� to go over to Macedonia and Achaia before going to Jerusalem. "And after that," he said, "I must go on to Rome!" / ��Or decided in his spirit
44Ac 19:22 He sent his two assistants, Timothy and Erastus, ahead to Macedonia while he stayed awhile longer in the province of Asia.
44Ac 19:23 About that time, serious trouble developed in Ephesus concerning the Way.
44Ac 19:24 It began with Demetrius, a silversmith who had a large business manufacturing silver shrines of the Greek goddess Artemis��. He kept many craftsmen busy. / ��Artemis is otherwise known as Diana.
44Ac 19:25 He called them together, along with others employed in similar trades, and addressed them as follows�� "Gentlemen, you know that our wealth comes from this business.
44Ac 19:26 But as you have seen and heard, this man Paul has persuaded many people that handmade gods aren't really gods at all. And he's done this not only here in Ephesus but throughout the entire province!
44Ac 19:27 Of course, I'm not just talking about the loss of public respect for our business. I'm also concerned that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will lose its influence and that Artemis?this magnificent goddess worshiped throughout the province of Asia and all around the world?will be robbed of her great prestige!"
44Ac 19:28 At this their anger boiled, and they began shouting, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44Ac 19:29 Soon the whole city was filled with confusion. Everyone rushed to the amphitheater, dragging along Gaius and Aristarchus, who were Paul's traveling companions from Macedonia.
44Ac 19:30 Paul wanted to go in, too, but the believers wouldn't let him.
44Ac 19:31 Some of the officials of the province, friends of Paul, also sent a message to him, begging him not to risk his life by entering the amphitheater.
44Ac 19:32 Inside, the people were all shouting, some one thing and some another. Everything was in confusion. In fact, most of them didn't even know why they were there.
44Ac 19:33 The Jews in the crowd pushed Alexander forward and told him to explain the situation. He motioned for silence and tried to speak.
44Ac 19:34 But when the crowd realized he was a Jew, they started shouting again and kept it up for two hours�� "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians! Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44Ac 19:35 At last the mayor was able to quiet them down enough to speak. "Citizens of Ephesus," he said. "Everyone knows that Ephesus is the official guardian of the temple of the great Artemis, whose image fell down to us from heaven.
44Ac 19:36 Since this is an undeniable fact, you should stay calm and not do anything rash.
44Ac 19:37 You have brought these men here, but they have stolen nothing from the temple and have not spoken against our goddess.
44Ac 19:38 "If Demetrius and the craftsmen have a case against them, the courts are in session and the officials can hear the case at once. Let them make formal charges.
44Ac 19:39 And if there are complaints about other matters, they can be settled in a legal assembly.
44Ac 19:40 I am afraid we are in danger of being charged with rioting by the Roman government, since there is no cause for all this commotion. And if Rome demands an explanation, we won't know what to say."
44Ac 19:41 ��Then he dismissed them, and they dispersed. / ��Some translations include verse 41 as part of verse 40
44Ac 20:1 When the uproar was over, Paul sent for the believers�� and encouraged them. Then he said good-bye and left for Macedonia. / ��Greek disciples
44Ac 20:2 While there, he encouraged the believers in all the towns he passed through. Then he traveled down to Greece,
44Ac 20:3 where he stayed for three months. He was preparing to sail back to Syria when he discovered a plot by some Jews against his life, so he decided to return through Macedonia.
44Ac 20:4 Several men were traveling with him. They were Sopater son of Pyrrhus from Berea; Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica; Gaius from Derbe; Timothy; and Tychicus and Trophimus from the province of Asia.
44Ac 20:5 They went on ahead and waited for us at Troas.
44Ac 20:6 After the Passover�� ended, we boarded a ship at Philippi in Macedonia and five days later joined them in Troas, where we stayed a week. / ��Greek the days of unleavened bread
44Ac 20:7 On the first day of the week, we gathered with the local believers to share in the Lord's Supper��. Paul was preaching to them, and since he was leaving the next day, he kept talking until midnight. / ��Greek to break bread
44Ac 20:8 The upstairs room where we met was lighted with many flickering lamps.
44Ac 20:9 As Paul spoke on and on, a young man named Eutychus, sitting on the windowsill, became very drowsy. Finally, he fell sound asleep and dropped three stories to his death below.
44Ac 20:10 Paul went down, bent over him, and took him into his arms. "Don't worry," he said, "he's alive!"
44Ac 20:11 Then they all went back upstairs, shared in the Lord's Supper��, and ate together. Paul continued talking to them until dawn, and then he left. / ��Greek broke the bread
44Ac 20:12 Meanwhile, the young man was taken home unhurt, and everyone was greatly relieved.
44Ac 20:13 Paul went by land to Assos, where he had arranged for us to join him, while we traveled by ship.
44Ac 20:14 He joined us there, and we sailed together to Mitylene.
44Ac 20:15 The next day we sailed past the island of Kios. The following day we crossed to the island of Samos, and�� a day later we arrived at Miletus. / ��Some manuscripts read and having stayed at Trogyllium
44Ac 20:16 Paul had decided to sail on past Ephesus, for he didn't want to spend any more time in the province of Asia. He was hurrying to get to Jerusalem, if possible, in time for the Festival of Pentecost.
44Ac 20:17 But when we landed at Miletus, he sent a message to the elders of the church at Ephesus, asking them to come and meet him.
44Ac 20:18 When they arrived he declared, "You know that from the day I set foot in the province of Asia until now
44Ac 20:19 I have done the Lord's work humbly and with many tears. I have endured the trials that came to me from the plots of the Jews.
44Ac 20:20 I never shrank back from telling you what you needed to hear, either publicly or in your homes.
44Ac 20:21 I have had one message for Jews and Greeks alike?the necessity of repenting from sin and turning to God, and of having faith in our Lord Jesus.
44Ac 20:22 "And now I am bound by the Spirit�� to go to Jerusalem. I don't know what awaits me, / ��Or by my spirit, or by an inner compulsion; Greek reads by the spirit
44Ac 20:23 except that the Holy Spirit tells me in city after city that jail and suffering lie ahead.
44Ac 20:24 But my life is worth nothing to me unless I use it for finishing the work assigned me by the Lord Jesus?the work of telling others the Good News about the wonderful grace of God.
44Ac 20:25 "And now I know that none of you to whom I have preached the Kingdom will ever see me again.
44Ac 20:26 I declare today that I have been faithful. If anyone suffers eternal death, it's not my fault��, / ��Greek I am innocent of the blood of all
44Ac 20:27 for I didn't shrink from declaring all that God wants you to know.
44Ac 20:28 "So guard yourselves and God's people. Feed and shepherd God's flock - his church, purchased with his own blood�� - over which the Holy Spirit has appointed you as elders��. / ��Or with the blood of his own [Son] ��Greek overseers
44Ac 20:29 I know that false teachers, like vicious wolves, will come in among you after I leave, not sparing the flock.
44Ac 20:30 Even some men from your own group will rise up and distort the truth in order to draw a following.
44Ac 20:31 Watch out! Remember the three years I was with you?my constant watch and care over you night and day, and my many tears for you.
44Ac 20:32 "And now I entrust you to God and the message of his grace that is able to build you up and give you an inheritance with all those he has set apart for himself.
44Ac 20:33 "I have never coveted anyone's silver or gold or fine clothes.
44Ac 20:34 You know that these hands of mine have worked to supply my own needs and even the needs of those who were with me.
44Ac 20:35 And I have been a constant example of how you can help those in need by working hard. You should remember the words of the Lord Jesus�� `It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
44Ac 20:36 When he had finished speaking, he knelt and prayed with them.
44Ac 20:37 They all cried as they embraced and kissed him good-bye.
44Ac 20:38 They were sad most of all because he had said that they would never see him again. Then they escorted him down to the ship.
44Ac 21:1 After saying farewell to the Ephesian elders, we sailed straight to the island of Cos. The next day we reached Rhodes and then went to Patara.
44Ac 21:2 There we boarded a ship sailing for Phoenicia.
44Ac 21:3 We sighted the island of Cyprus, passed it on our left, and landed at the harbor of Tyre, in Syria, where the ship was to unload its cargo.
44Ac 21:4 We went ashore, found the local believers��, and stayed with them a week. These believers prophesied through the Holy Spirit that Paul should not go on to Jerusalem. / ��Greek disciples; also in 21.16
44Ac 21:5 When we returned to the ship at the end of the week, the entire congregation, including women�� and children, left the city and came down to the shore with us. There we knelt, prayed, / ��Or wives
44Ac 21:6 and said our farewells. Then we went aboard, and they returned home.
44Ac 21:7 The next stop after leaving Tyre was Ptolemais, where we greeted the brothers and sisters�� and stayed for one day. / ��Greek brothers; also in 21.17
44Ac 21:8 The next day we went on to Caesarea and stayed at the home of Philip the Evangelist, one of the seven men who had been chosen to distribute food.
44Ac 21:9 He had four unmarried daughters who had the gift of prophecy.
44Ac 21:10 Several days later a man named Agabus, who also had the gift of prophecy, arrived from Judea.
44Ac 21:11 He came over, took Paul's belt, and bound his own feet and hands with it. Then he said, "The Holy Spirit declares, `So shall the owner of this belt be bound by the Jewish leaders in Jerusalem and turned over to the Gentiles.'"
44Ac 21:12 When we heard this, we and the local believers all begged Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:13 But he said, "Why all this weeping? You are breaking my heart! I am ready not only to be jailed at Jerusalem but even to die for the sake of the Lord Jesus."
44Ac 21:14 When it was clear that we couldn't persuade him, we gave up and said, "The Lord's will be done."
44Ac 21:15 After this we packed our things and left for Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:16 Some believers from Caesarea accompanied us, and they took us to the home of Mnason, a man originally from Cyprus and one of the early believers.
44Ac 21:17 When we arrived, the brothers and sisters in Jerusalem welcomed us warmly.
44Ac 21:18 The next day Paul went with us to meet with James, and all the elders of the Jerusalem church were present.
44Ac 21:19 After greeting them, Paul gave a detailed account of the things God had accomplished among the Gentiles through his ministry.
44Ac 21:20 After hearing this, they praised God. And then they said, "You know, dear brother, how many thousands of Jews have also believed, and they all follow the law of Moses very seriously.
44Ac 21:21 But the Jewish believers here in Jerusalem have been told that you are teaching all the Jews who live among the Gentiles to turn their backs on the laws of Moses. They've heard that you teach them not to circumcise their children or follow other Jewish customs.
44Ac 21:22 What should we do? They will certainly hear that you have come.
44Ac 21:23 "Here's what we want you to do. We have four men here who have completed their vow.
44Ac 21:24 Go with them to the Temple and join them in the purification ceremony, paying for them to have their heads ritually shaved. Then everyone will know that the rumors are all false and that you yourself observe the Jewish laws.
44Ac 21:25 "As for the Gentile believers, they should do what we already told them in a letter�� They should abstain from eating food offered to idols, from consuming blood or the meat of strangled animals, and from sexual immorality."
44Ac 21:26 So Paul went to the Temple the next day with the other men. They had already started the purification ritual, so he publicly announced the date when their vows would end and sacrifices would be offered for each of them.
44Ac 21:27 The seven days were almost ended when some Jews from the province of Asia saw Paul in the Temple and roused a mob against him. They grabbed him,
44Ac 21:28 yelling, "Men of Israel, help us! This is the man who preaches against our people everywhere and tells everybody to disobey the Jewish laws. He speaks against the Temple - and even defiles this holy place by bringing in Gentiles��." / ��Greek Greeks
44Ac 21:29 (For earlier that day they had seen him in the city with Trophimus, a Gentile from Ephesus��, and they assumed Paul had taken him into the Temple.) / ��Greek Trophimus, the Ephesian
44Ac 21:30 The whole city was rocked by these accusations, and a great riot followed. Paul was grabbed and dragged out of the Temple, and immediately the gates were closed behind him.
44Ac 21:31 As they were trying to kill him, word reached the commander of the Roman regiment that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
44Ac 21:32 He immediately called out his soldiers and officers�� and ran down among the crowd. When the mob saw the commander and the troops coming, they stopped beating Paul. / ��Greek centurions
44Ac 21:33 Then the commander arrested him and ordered him bound with two chains. He asked the crowd who he was and what he had done.
44Ac 21:34 Some shouted one thing and some another. Since he couldn't find out the truth in all the uproar and confusion, he ordered that Paul be taken to the fortress.
44Ac 21:35 As Paul reached the stairs, the mob grew so violent the soldiers had to lift him to their shoulders to protect him.
44Ac 21:36 And the crowd followed behind, shouting, "Kill him, kill him!"
44Ac 21:37 As Paul was about to be taken inside, he said to the commander, "May I have a word with you?" "Do you know Greek?" the commander asked, surprised.
44Ac 21:38 "Aren't you the Egyptian who led a rebellion some time ago and took 4,000 members of the Assassins out into the desert?"
44Ac 21:39 "No," Paul replied, "I am a Jew and a citizen of Tarsus in Cilicia, which is an important city. Please, let me talk to these people."
44Ac 21:40 The commander agreed, so Paul stood on the stairs and motioned to the people to be quiet. Soon a deep silence enveloped the crowd, and he addressed them in their own language, Aramaic��. / ��Or Hebrew
44Ac 22:1 "Brothers and esteemed fathers," Paul said, "listen to me as I offer my defense."
44Ac 22:2 When they heard him speaking in their own language��, the silence was even greater. / ��Greek in Aramaic, or in Hebrew
44Ac 22:3 Then Paul said, "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, and I was brought up and educated here in Jerusalem under Gamaliel. As his student, I was carefully trained in our Jewish laws and customs. I became very zealous to honor God in everything I did, just like all of you today.
44Ac 22:4 And I persecuted the followers of the Way, hounding some to death, arresting both men and women and throwing them in prison.
44Ac 22:5 The high priest and the whole council of elders can testify that this is so. For I received letters from them to our Jewish brothers in Damascus, authorizing me to bring the Christians from there to Jerusalem, in chains, to be punished.
44Ac 22:6 "As I was on the road, approaching Damascus about noon, a very bright light from heaven suddenly shone down around me.
44Ac 22:7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, `Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'
44Ac 22:8 "`Who are you, lord?' I asked. "And the voice replied, `I am Jesus the Nazarene��, the one you are persecuting.' / ��Or Jesus of Nazareth
44Ac 22:9 The people with me saw the light but didn't understand the voice speaking to me.
44Ac 22:10 "I asked, `What should I do, Lord?' "And the Lord told me, `Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told everything you are to do.'
44Ac 22:11 "I was blinded by the intense light and had to be led by the hand to Damascus by my companions.
44Ac 22:12 A man named Ananias lived there. He was a godly man, deeply devoted to the law, and well regarded by all the Jews of Damascus.
44Ac 22:13 He came and stood beside me and said, `Brother Saul, regain your sight.' And that very moment I could see him!
44Ac 22:14 "Then he told me, `The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will and to see the Righteous One and hear him speak.
44Ac 22:15 For you are to be his witness, telling everyone what you have seen and heard.
44Ac 22:16 What are you waiting for? Get up and be baptized. Have your sins washed away by calling on the name of the Lord.'
44Ac 22:17 "After I returned to Jerusalem, I was praying in the Temple and fell into a trance.
44Ac 22:18 I saw a vision of Jesus�� saying to me, `Hurry! Leave Jerusalem, for the people here won't accept your testimony about me.' / ��Greek him
44Ac 22:19 "`But Lord,' I argued, `they certainly know that in every synagogue I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.
44Ac 22:20 And I was in complete agreement when your witness Stephen was killed. I stood by and kept the coats they took off when they stoned him.'
44Ac 22:21 "But the Lord said to me, `Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles!'"
44Ac 22:22 The crowd listened until Paul said that word. Then they all began to shout, "Away with such a fellow! He isn't fit to live!"
44Ac 22:23 They yelled, threw off their coats, and tossed handfuls of dust into the air.
44Ac 22:24 The commander brought Paul inside and ordered him lashed with whips to make him confess his crime. He wanted to find out why the crowd had become so furious.
44Ac 22:25 When they tied Paul down to lash him, Paul said to the officer�� standing there, "Is it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn't even been tried?" / ��Greek the centurion; also in 22.26
44Ac 22:26 When the officer heard this, he went to the commander and asked, "What are you doing? This man is a Roman citizen!"
44Ac 22:27 So the commander went over and asked Paul, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes, I certainly am," Paul replied.
44Ac 22:28 "I am, too," the commander muttered, "and it cost me plenty!" Paul answered, "But I am a citizen by birth!"
44Ac 22:29 The soldiers who were about to interrogate Paul quickly withdrew when they heard he was a Roman citizen, and the commander was frightened because he had ordered him bound and whipped.
44Ac 22:30 The next day the commander ordered the leading priests into session with the Jewish high council��. He wanted to find out what the trouble was all about, so he released Paul to have him stand before them. / ��Greek Sanhedrin
44Ac 23:1 Gazing intently at the high council��, Paul began�� "Brothers, I have always lived before God with a clear conscience!" / ��Greek Sanhedrin; also in 23.6, 15, 20, 28
44Ac 23:2 Instantly Ananias the high priest commanded those close to Paul to slap him on the mouth.
44Ac 23:3 But Paul said to him, "God will slap you, you corrupt hypocrite��! What kind of judge are you to break the law yourself by ordering me struck like that?" / ��Greek you whitewashed wall
44Ac 23:4 Those standing near Paul said to him, "Do you dare to insult God's high priest?"
44Ac 23:5 "I'm sorry, brothers. I didn't realize he was the high priest," Paul replied, "for the Scriptures say, `You must not speak evil of any of your rulers.'��" / ��Exod 22.28
44Ac 23:6 Paul realized that some members of the high council were Sadducees and some were Pharisees, so he shouted, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, as were my ancestors! And I am on trial because my hope is in the resurrection of the dead!"
44Ac 23:7 This divided the council?the Pharisees against the Sadducees?
44Ac 23:8 for the Sadducees say there is no resurrection or angels or spirits, but the Pharisees believe in all of these.
44Ac 23:9 So there was a great uproar. Some of the teachers of religious law who were Pharisees jumped up and began to argue forcefully. "We see nothing wrong with him," they shouted. "Perhaps a spirit or an angel spoke to him."
44Ac 23:10 As the conflict grew more violent, the commander was afraid they would tear Paul apart. So he ordered his soldiers to go and rescue him by force and take him back to the fortress.
44Ac 23:11 That night the Lord appeared to Paul and said, "Be encouraged, Paul. Just as you have been a witness to me here in Jerusalem, you must preach the Good News in Rome as well."
44Ac 23:12 The next morning a group of Jews�� got together and bound themselves with an oath not to eat or drink until they had killed Paul. / ��Greek the Jews
44Ac 23:13 There were more than forty of them in the conspiracy.
44Ac 23:14 They went to the leading priests and elders and told them, "We have bound ourselves with an oath to eat nothing until we have killed Paul.
44Ac 23:15 So you and the high council should ask the commander to bring Paul back to the council again. Pretend you want to examine his case more fully. We will kill him on the way."
44Ac 23:16 But Paul's nephew?his sister's son?heard of their plan and went to the fortress and told Paul.
44Ac 23:17 Paul called for one of the Roman officers�� and said, "Take this young man to the commander. He has something important to tell him." / ��Greek centurions; also in 23.23
44Ac 23:18 So the officer did, explaining, "Paul, the prisoner, called me over and asked me to bring this young man to you because he has something to tell you."
44Ac 23:19 The commander took his hand, led him aside, and asked, "What is it you want to tell me?"
44Ac 23:20 Paul's nephew told him, "Some Jews are going to ask you to bring Paul before the high council tomorrow, pretending they want to get some more information.
44Ac 23:21 But don't do it! There are more than forty men hiding along the way ready to ambush him. They have vowed not to eat or drink anything until they have killed him. They are ready now, just waiting for your consent."
44Ac 23:22 "Don't let anyone know you told me this," the commander warned the young man.
44Ac 23:23 Then the commander called two of his officers and ordered, "Get 200 soldiers ready to leave for Caesarea at nine o'clock tonight. Also take 200 spearmen and 70 mounted troops.
44Ac 23:24 Provide horses for Paul to ride, and get him safely to Governor Felix."
44Ac 23:25 Then he wrote this letter to the governor.
44Ac 23:26 "From Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency, Governor Felix�� Greetings!
44Ac 23:27 "This man was seized by some Jews, and they were about to kill him when I arrived with the troops. When I learned that he was a Roman citizen, I removed him to safety.
44Ac 23:28 Then I took him to their high council to try to learn the basis of the accusations against him.
44Ac 23:29 I soon discovered the charge was something regarding their religious law?certainly nothing worthy of imprisonment or death.
44Ac 23:30 But when I was informed of a plot to kill him, I immediately sent him on to you. I have told his accusers to bring their charges before you."
44Ac 23:31 So that night, as ordered, the soldiers took Paul as far as Antipatris.
44Ac 23:32 They returned to the fortress the next morning, while the mounted troops took him on to Caesarea.
44Ac 23:33 When they arrived in Caesarea, they presented Paul and the letter to Governor Felix.
44Ac 23:34 He read it and then asked Paul what province he was from. "Cilicia," Paul answered.
44Ac 23:35 "I will hear your case myself when your accusers arrive," the governor told him. Then the governor ordered him kept in the prison at Herod's headquarters��. / ��Greek Herod's Praetorium
44Ac 24:1 Five days later Ananias, the high priest, arrived with some of the Jewish elders and the lawyer�� Tertullus, to present their case against Paul to the governor. / ��Greek some elders and an orator
44Ac 24:2 When Paul was called in, Tertullus presented the charges against Paul in the following address to the governor�� "Your Excellency, you have provided a long period of peace for us Jews and with foresight have enacted reforms for us.
44Ac 24:3 For all of this we are very grateful to you.
44Ac 24:4 But I don't want to bore you, so please give me your attention for only a moment.
44Ac 24:5 We have found this man to be a troublemaker who is constantly stirring up riots among the Jews all over the world. He is a ringleader of the cult known as the Nazarenes.
44Ac 24:6 Furthermore, he was trying to desecrate the Temple when we arrested him.
44Ac 24:7 �� / ��Some manuscripts add an expanded conclusion to verse 6, all of verse 7, and an additional phrase in verse 8�� We would have judged him by our law, 7 but Lysias, the commander of the garrison, came and violently took him away from us, 8 commanding his accusers to come before you.
44Ac 24:8 You can find out the truth of our accusations by examining him yourself."
44Ac 24:9 Then the other Jews chimed in, declaring that everything Tertullus said was true.
44Ac 24:10 The governor then motioned for Paul to speak. Paul said, "I know, sir, that you have been a judge of Jewish affairs for many years, so I gladly present my defense before you.
44Ac 24:11 You can quickly discover that I arrived in Jerusalem no more than twelve days ago to worship at the Temple.
44Ac 24:12 My accusers never found me arguing with anyone in the Temple, nor stirring up a riot in any synagogue or on the streets of the city.
44Ac 24:13 These men cannot prove the things they accuse me of doing.
44Ac 24:14 "But I admit that I follow the Way, which they call a cult. I worship the God of our ancestors, and I firmly believe the Jewish law and everything written in the prophets.
44Ac 24:15 I have the same hope in God that these men have, that he will raise both the righteous and the unrighteous.
44Ac 24:16 Because of this, I always try to maintain a clear conscience before God and all people.
44Ac 24:17 "After several years away, I returned to Jerusalem with money to aid my people and to offer sacrifices to God.
44Ac 24:18 My accusers saw me in the Temple as I was completing a purification ceremony. There was no crowd around me and no rioting.
44Ac 24:19 But some Jews from the province of Asia were there?and they ought to be here to bring charges if they have anything against me!
44Ac 24:20 Ask these men here what crime the Jewish high council�� found me guilty of, / ��Greek Sanhedrin
44Ac 24:21 except for the one time I shouted out, `I am on trial before you today because I believe in the resurrection of the dead!'"
44Ac 24:22 At that point Felix, who was quite familiar with the Way, adjourned the hearing and said, "Wait until Lysias, the garrison commander, arrives. Then I will decide the case."
44Ac 24:23 He ordered an officer�� to keep Paul in custody but to give him some freedom and allow his friends to visit him and take care of his needs. / ��Greek a centurion
44Ac 24:24 A few days later Felix came back with his wife, Drusilla, who was Jewish. Sending for Paul, they listened as he told them about faith in Christ Jesus.
44Ac 24:25 As he reasoned with them about righteousness and self-control and the coming day of judgment, Felix became frightened. "Go away for now," he replied. "When it is more convenient, I'll call for you again."
44Ac 24:26 He also hoped that Paul would bribe him, so he sent for him quite often and talked with him.
44Ac 24:27 After two years went by in this way, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And because Felix wanted to gain favor with the Jewish people, he left Paul in prison.
44Ac 25:1 Three days after Festus arrived in Caesarea to take over his new responsibilities, he left for Jerusalem,
44Ac 25:2 where the leading priests and other Jewish leaders met with him and made their accusations against Paul.
44Ac 25:3 They asked Festus as a favor to transfer Paul to Jerusalem ��. / ��planning to ambush and kill him on the way
44Ac 25:4 But Festus replied that Paul was at Caesarea and he himself would be returning there soon.
44Ac 25:5 So he said, "Those of you in authority can return with me. If Paul has done anything wrong, you can make your accusations."
44Ac 25:6 About eight or ten days later Festus returned to Caesarea, and on the following day he took his seat in court and ordered that Paul be brought in.
44Ac 25:7 When Paul arrived, the Jewish leaders from Jerusalem gathered around and made many serious accusations they couldn't prove.
44Ac 25:8 Paul denied the charges. "I am not guilty of any crime against the Jewish laws or the Temple or the Roman government," he said.
44Ac 25:9 Then Festus, wanting to please the Jews, asked him, "Are you willing to go to Jerusalem and stand trial before me there?"
44Ac 25:10 But Paul replied, "No! This is the official Roman court, so I ought to be tried right here. You know very well I am not guilty of harming the Jews.
44Ac 25:11 If I have done something worthy of death, I don't refuse to die. But if I am innocent, no one has a right to turn me over to these men to kill me. I appeal to Caesar!"
44Ac 25:12 Festus conferred with his advisers and then replied, "Very well! You have appealed to Caesar, and to Caesar you will go!"
44Ac 25:13 A few days later King Agrippa arrived with his sister, Bernice��, to pay their respects to Festus. / ��Greek Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived
44Ac 25:14 During their stay of several days, Festus discussed Paul's case with the king. "There is a prisoner here," he told him, "whose case was left for me by Felix.
44Ac 25:15 When I was in Jerusalem, the leading priests and Jewish elders pressed charges against him and asked me to condemn him.
44Ac 25:16 I pointed out to them that Roman law does not convict people without a trial. They must be given an opportunity to confront their accusers and defend themselves.
44Ac 25:17 "When his accusers came here for the trial, I didn't delay. I called the case the very next day and ordered Paul brought in.
44Ac 25:18 But the accusations made against him weren't any of the crimes I expected.
44Ac 25:19 Instead, it was something about their religion and a dead man named Jesus, who Paul insists is alive.
44Ac 25:20 I was at a loss to know how to investigate these things, so I asked him whether he would be willing to stand trial on these charges in Jerusalem.
44Ac 25:21 But Paul appealed to have his case decided by the emperor. So I ordered that he be held in custody until I could arrange to send him to Caesar."
44Ac 25:22 "I'd like to hear the man myself," Agrippa saidAnd Festus replied, "You will?tomorrow!"
44Ac 25:23 So the next day Agrippa and Bernice arrived at the auditorium with great pomp, accompanied by military officers and prominent men of the city. Festus ordered that Paul be brought in.
44Ac 25:24 Then Festus said, "King Agrippa and all who are here, this is the man whose death is demanded by all the Jews, both here and in Jerusalem.
44Ac 25:25 But in my opinion he has done nothing deserving death. However, since he appealed his case to the emperor, I have decided to send him to Rome.
44Ac 25:26 "But what shall I write the emperor? For there is no clear charge against him. So I have brought him before all of you, and especially you, King Agrippa, so that after we examine him, I might have something to write.
44Ac 25:27 For it makes no sense to send a prisoner to the emperor without specifying the charges against him!"
44Ac 26:1 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You may speak in your defense." So Paul, gesturing with his hand, started his defense.
44Ac 26:2 "I am fortunate, King Agrippa, that you are the one hearing my defense today against all these accusations made by the Jewish leaders,
44Ac 26:3 for I know you are an expert on all Jewish customs and controversies. Now please listen to me patiently!
44Ac 26:4 "As the Jewish leaders are well aware, I was given a thorough Jewish training from my earliest childhood among my own people and in Jerusalem.
44Ac 26:5 If they would admit it, they know that I have been a member of the Pharisees, the strictest sect of our religion.
44Ac 26:6 Now I am on trial because of my hope in the fulfillment of God's promise made to our ancestors.
44Ac 26:7 In fact, that is why the twelve tribes of Israel zealously worship God night and day, and they share the same hope I have. Yet, Your Majesty, they accuse me for having this hope!
44Ac 26:8 Why does it seem incredible to any of you that God can raise the dead?
44Ac 26:9 "I used to believe that I ought to do everything I could to oppose the very name of Jesus the Nazarene��. / ��Or Jesus of Nazareth
44Ac 26:10 Indeed, I did just that in Jerusalem. Authorized by the leading priests, I caused many believers�� there to be sent to prison. And I cast my vote against them when they were condemned to death. / ��Greek many of God's holy people
44Ac 26:11 Many times I had them punished in the synagogues to get them to curse Jesus��. I was so violently opposed to them that I even chased them down in foreign cities. / ��Greek to blaspheme
44Ac 26:12 "One day I was on such a mission to Damascus, armed with the authority and commission of the leading priests.
44Ac 26:13 About noon, Your Majesty, as I was on the road, a light from heaven brighter than the sun shone down on me and my companions.
44Ac 26:14 We all fell down, and I heard a voice saying to me in Aramaic��, `Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is useless for you to fight against my will.��' / ��Or Hebrew ��Greek It is hard for you to kick against the oxgoads
44Ac 26:15 "`Who are you, lord?' I asked"And the Lord replied, `I am Jesus, the one you are persecuting.
44Ac 26:16 Now get to your feet! For I have appeared to you to appoint you as my servant and witness. You are to tell the world what you have seen and what I will show you in the future.
44Ac 26:17 And I will rescue you from both your own people and the Gentiles. Yes, I am sending you to the Gentiles
44Ac 26:18 to open their eyes, so they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God. Then they will receive forgiveness for their sins and be given a place among God's people, who are set apart by faith in me.'
44Ac 26:19 "And so, King Agrippa, I obeyed that vision from heaven.
44Ac 26:20 I preached first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that all must repent of their sins and turn to God?and prove they have changed by the good things they do.
44Ac 26:21 Some Jews arrested me in the Temple for preaching this, and they tried to kill me.
44Ac 26:22 But God has protected me right up to this present time so I can testify to everyone, from the least to the greatest. I teach nothing except what the prophets and Moses said would happen?
44Ac 26:23 that the Messiah would suffer and be the first to rise from the dead, and in this way announce God's light to Jews and Gentiles alike."
44Ac 26:24 Suddenly, Festus shouted, "Paul, you are insane. Too much study has made you crazy!"
44Ac 26:25 But Paul replied, "I am not insane, Most Excellent Festus. What I am saying is the sober truth.
44Ac 26:26 And King Agrippa knows about these things. I speak boldly, for I am sure these events are all familiar to him, for they were not done in a corner!
44Ac 26:27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you do?"
44Ac 26:28 Agrippa interrupted him. "Do you think you can persuade me to become a Christian so quickly?"�� / ��Or "A little more, and your arguments would make me a Christian."
44Ac 26:29 Paul replied, "Whether quickly or not, I pray to God that both you and everyone here in this audience might become the same as I am, except for these chains."
44Ac 26:30 Then the king, the governor, Bernice, and all the others stood and left.
44Ac 26:31 As they went out, they talked it over and agreed, "This man hasn't done anything to deserve death or imprisonment."
44Ac 26:32 And Agrippa said to Festus, "He could have been set free if he hadn't appealed to Caesar."
44Ac 27:1 When the time came, we set sail for Italy. Paul and several other prisoners were placed in the custody of a Roman officer�� named Julius, a captain of the Imperial Regiment. / ��Greek centurion; similarly in 27.6, 11, 31, 43
44Ac 27:2 Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, was also with us. We left on a ship whose home port was Adramyttium on the northwest coast of the province of Asia��; it was scheduled to make several stops at ports along the coast of the province. / ��Asia was a Roman province in what is now western Turkey
44Ac 27:3 The next day when we docked at Sidon, Julius was very kind to Paul and let him go ashore to visit with friends so they could provide for his needs.
44Ac 27:4 Putting out to sea from there, we encountered strong headwinds that made it difficult to keep the ship on course, so we sailed north of Cyprus between the island and the mainland.
44Ac 27:5 Keeping to the open sea, we passed along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, landing at Myra, in the province of Lycia.
44Ac 27:6 There the commanding officer found an Egyptian ship from Alexandria that was bound for Italy, and he put us on board.
44Ac 27:7 We had several days of slow sailing, and after great difficulty we finally neared Cnidus. But the wind was against us, so we sailed across to Crete and along the sheltered coast of the island, past the cape of Salmone.
44Ac 27:8 We struggled along the coast with great difficulty and finally arrived at Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.
44Ac 27:9 We had lost a lot of time. The weather was becoming dangerous for sea travel because it was so late in the fall��, and Paul spoke to the ship's officers about it. / ��Greek because the fast was now already gone by. This fast was associated with the Day of Atonement (Yom Kippur), which occurred in late September or early October
44Ac 27:10 "Men," he said, "I believe there is trouble ahead if we go on?shipwreck, loss of cargo, and danger to our lives as well."
44Ac 27:11 But the officer in charge of the prisoners listened more to the ship's captain and the owner than to Paul.
44Ac 27:12 And since Fair Havens was an exposed harbor?a poor place to spend the winter?most of the crew wanted to go on to Phoenix, farther up the coast of Crete, and spend the winter there. Phoenix was a good harbor with only a southwest and northwest exposure.
44Ac 27:13 When a light wind began blowing from the south, the sailors thought they could make it. So they pulled up anchor and sailed close to the shore of Crete.
44Ac 27:14 But the weather changed abruptly, and a wind of typhoon strength (called a "northeaster") burst across the island and blew us out to sea.
44Ac 27:15 The sailors couldn't turn the ship into the wind, so they gave up and let it run before the gale.
44Ac 27:16 We sailed along the sheltered side of a small island named Cauda��, where with great difficulty we hoisted aboard the lifeboat being towed behind us. / ��Some manuscripts read Clauda
44Ac 27:17 Then the sailors bound ropes around the hull of the ship to strengthen it. They were afraid of being driven across to the sandbars of Syrtis off the African coast, so they lowered the sea anchor to slow the ship and were driven before the wind.
44Ac 27:18 The next day, as gale-force winds continued to batter the ship, the crew began throwing the cargo overboard.
44Ac 27:19 The following day they even took some of the ship's gear and threw it overboard.
44Ac 27:20 The terrible storm raged for many days, blotting out the sun and the stars, until at last all hope was gone.
44Ac 27:21 No one had eaten for a long time. Finally, Paul called the crew together and said, "Men, you should have listened to me in the first place and not left Crete. You would have avoided all this damage and loss.
44Ac 27:22 But take courage! None of you will lose your lives, even though the ship will go down.
44Ac 27:23 For last night an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I serve stood beside me,
44Ac 27:24 and he said, `Don't be afraid, Paul, for you will surely stand trial before Caesar! What's more, God in his goodness has granted safety to everyone sailing with you.'
44Ac 27:25 So take courage! For I believe God. It will be just as he said.
44Ac 27:26 But we will be shipwrecked on an island."
44Ac 27:27 About midnight on the fourteenth night of the storm, as we were being driven across the Sea of Adria��, the sailors sensed land was near. / ��The Sea of Adria includes the central portion of the Mediterranean
44Ac 27:28 They dropped a weighted line and found that the water was 120 feet deep. But a little later they measured again and found it was only 90 feet deep��. / ��Greek 20 fathoms . . . 15 fathoms [37 meters . . . 27 meters]
44Ac 27:29 At this rate they were afraid we would soon be driven against the rocks along the shore, so they threw out four anchors from the back of the ship and prayed for daylight.
44Ac 27:30 Then the sailors tried to abandon the ship; they lowered the lifeboat as though they were going to put out anchors from the front of the ship.
44Ac 27:31 But Paul said to the commanding officer and the soldiers, "You will all die unless the sailors stay aboard."
44Ac 27:32 So the soldiers cut the ropes to the lifeboat and let it drift away.
44Ac 27:33 Just as day was dawning, Paul urged everyone to eat. "You have been so worried that you haven't touched food for two weeks," he said.
44Ac 27:34 "Please eat something now for your own good. For not a hair of your heads will perish."
44Ac 27:35 Then he took some bread, gave thanks to God before them all, and broke off a piece and ate it.
44Ac 27:36 Then everyone was encouraged and began to eat?
44Ac 27:37 all 276 of us who were on board.
44Ac 27:38 After eating, the crew lightened the ship further by throwing the cargo of wheat overboard.
44Ac 27:39 When morning dawned, they didn't recognize the coastline, but they saw a bay with a beach and wondered if they could get to shore by running the ship aground.
44Ac 27:40 So they cut off the anchors and left them in the sea. Then they lowered the rudders, raised the foresail, and headed toward shore.
44Ac 27:41 But they hit a shoal and ran the ship aground too soon. The bow of the ship stuck fast, while the stern was repeatedly smashed by the force of the waves and began to break apart.
44Ac 27:42 The soldiers wanted to kill the prisoners to make sure they didn't swim ashore and escape.
44Ac 27:43 But the commanding officer wanted to spare Paul, so he didn't let them carry out their plan. Then he ordered all who could swim to jump overboard first and make for land.
44Ac 27:44 The others held onto planks or debris from the broken ship��. So everyone escaped safely to shore. / ��Or or were helped by members of the ship's crew
44Ac 28:1 Once we were safe on shore, we learned that we were on the island of Malta.
44Ac 28:2 The people of the island were very kind to us. It was cold and rainy, so they built a fire on the shore to welcome us.
44Ac 28:3 As Paul gathered an armful of sticks and was laying them on the fire, a poisonous snake, driven out by the heat, bit him on the hand.
44Ac 28:4 The people of the island saw it hanging from his hand and said to each other, "A murderer, no doubt! Though he escaped the sea, justice will not permit him to live."
44Ac 28:5 But Paul shook off the snake into the fire and was unharmed.
44Ac 28:6 The people waited for him to swell up or suddenly drop dead. But when they had waited a long time and saw that he wasn't harmed, they changed their minds and decided he was a god.
44Ac 28:7 Near the shore where we landed was an estate belonging to Publius, the chief official of the island. He welcomed us and treated us kindly for three days.
44Ac 28:8 As it happened, Publius's father was ill with fever and dysentery. Paul went in and prayed for him, and laying his hands on him, he healed him.
44Ac 28:9 Then all the other sick people on the island came and were healed.
44Ac 28:10 As a result we were showered with honors, and when the time came to sail, people supplied us with everything we would need for the trip.
44Ac 28:11 It was three months after the shipwreck that we set sail on another ship that had wintered at the island - an Alexandrian ship with the twin gods�� as its figurehead. / ��The twin gods were the Roman gods Castor and Pollux
44Ac 28:12 Our first stop was Syracuse��, where we stayed three days. / ��Syracuse was on the island of Sicily
44Ac 28:13 From there we sailed across to Rhegium��. A day later a south wind began blowing, so the following day we sailed up the coast to Puteoli. / ��Rhegium was on the southern tip of Italy
44Ac 28:14 There we found some believers��, who invited us to spend a week with them. And so we came to Rome. / ��Greek brothers
44Ac 28:15 The brothers and sisters�� in Rome had heard we were coming, and they came to meet us at the Forum�� on the Appian Way. Others joined us at The Three Taverns��. When Paul saw them, he was encouraged and thanked God. / ��Greek brothers ��The Forum was about 43 miles [70 kilometers] from Rome ��The Three Taverns was about 35 miles [57 kilometers] from Rome
44Ac 28:16 When we arrived in Rome, Paul was permitted to have his own private lodging, though he was guarded by a soldier.
44Ac 28:17 Three days after Paul's arrival, he called together the local Jewish leaders. He said to them, "Brothers, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Roman government, even though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our ancestors.
44Ac 28:18 The Romans tried me and wanted to release me, because they found no cause for the death sentence.
44Ac 28:19 But when the Jewish leaders protested the decision, I felt it necessary to appeal to Caesar, even though I had no desire to press charges against my own people.
44Ac 28:20 I asked you to come here today so we could get acquainted and so I could explain to you that I am bound with this chain because I believe that the hope of Israel?the Messiah?has already come."
44Ac 28:21 They replied, "We have had no letters from Judea or reports against you from anyone who has come here.
44Ac 28:22 But we want to hear what you believe, for the only thing we know about this movement is that it is denounced everywhere."
44Ac 28:23 So a time was set, and on that day a large number of people came to Paul's lodging. He explained and testified about the Kingdom of God and tried to persuade them about Jesus from the Scriptures. Using the law of Moses and the books of the prophets, he spoke to them from morning until evening.
44Ac 28:24 Some were persuaded by the things he said, but others did not believe.
44Ac 28:25 And after they had argued back and forth among themselves, they left with this final word from Paul�� "The Holy Spirit was right when he said to your ancestors through Isaiah the prophet,
44Ac 28:26 `Go and say to this people�� When you hear what I say, you will not understand. When you see what I do, you will not comprehend.
44Ac 28:27 For the hearts of these people are hardened, and their ears cannot hear, and they have closed their eyes? so their eyes cannot see, and their ears cannot hear, and their hearts cannot understand, and they cannot turn to me and let me heal them.'�� / ��Isa 6.9-10, Greek version
44Ac 28:28 So I want you to know that this salvation from God has also been offered to the Gentiles, and they will accept it."
44Ac 28:29 �� / ��Some manuscripts add verse 29, And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, greatly disagreeing with each other.
44Ac 28:30 For the next two years, Paul lived in Rome at his own expense��. He welcomed all who visited him, / ��Or in his own rented quarters
44Ac 28:31 boldly proclaiming the Kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ. And no one tried to stop him.

45Rm 1:1 This letter is from Paul, a slave of Christ Jesus, chosen by God to be an apostle and sent out to preach his Good News.
45Rm 1:2 God promised this Good News long ago through his prophets in the holy Scriptures.
45Rm 1:3 The Good News is about his Son. In his earthly life he was born into King David's family line,
45Rm 1:4 and he was shown to be�� the Son of God when he was raised from the dead by the power of the Holy Spirit��. He is Jesus Christ our Lord. / ��Or and was designated ��Or by the Spirit of holiness; or in the new realm of the Spirit
45Rm 1:5 Through Christ, God has given us the privilege�� and authority as apostles to tell Gentiles everywhere what God has done for them, so that they will believe and obey him, bringing glory to his name. / ��Or the grace
45Rm 1:6 And you are included among those Gentiles who have been called to belong to Jesus Christ.
45Rm 1:7 I am writing to all of you in Rome who are loved by God and are called to be his own holy people. May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
45Rm 1:8 Let me say first that I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith in him is being talked about all over the world.
45Rm 1:9 God knows how often I pray for you. Day and night I bring you and your needs in prayer to God, whom I serve with all my heart�� by spreading the Good News about his Son. / ��Or in my spirit
45Rm 1:10 One of the things I always pray for is the opportunity, God willing, to come at last to see you.
45Rm 1:11 For I long to visit you so I can bring you some spiritual gift that will help you grow strong in the Lord.
45Rm 1:12 When we get together, I want to encourage you in your faith, but I also want to be encouraged by yours.
45Rm 1:13 I want you to know, dear brothers and sisters��, that I planned many times to visit you, but I was prevented until now. I want to work among you and see spiritual fruit, just as I have seen among other Gentiles. / ��Greek brothers
45Rm 1:14 For I have a great sense of obligation to people in both the civilized world and the rest of the world��, to the educated and uneducated alike. / ��Greek to Greeks and barbarians
45Rm 1:15 So I am eager to come to you in Rome, too, to preach the Good News.
45Rm 1:16 For I am not ashamed of this Good News about Christ. It is the power of God at work, saving everyone who believes-the Jew first and also the Gentile��. / ��Greek also the Greek
45Rm 1:17 This Good News tells us how God makes us right in his sight. This is accomplished from start to finish by faith. As the Scriptures say, "It is through faith that a righteous person has life."�� / ��Or "The righteous will live by faith." Hab 2.4
45Rm 1:18 But God shows his anger from heaven against all sinful, wicked people who suppress the truth by their wickedness��. / ��Or who, by their wickedness, prevent the truth from being known
45Rm 1:19 They know the truth about God because he has made it obvious to them.
45Rm 1:20 For ever since the world was created, people have seen the earth and sky. Through everything God made, they can clearly see his invisible qualities?his eternal power and divine nature. So they have no excuse for not knowing God.
45Rm 1:21 Yes, they knew God, but they wouldn't worship him as God or even give him thanks. And they began to think up foolish ideas of what God was like. As a result, their minds became dark and confused.
45Rm 1:22 Claiming to be wise, they instead became utter fools.
45Rm 1:23 And instead of worshiping the glorious, ever-living God, they worshiped idols made to look like mere people and birds and animals and reptiles.
45Rm 1:24 So God abandoned them to do whatever shameful things their hearts desired. As a result, they did vile and degrading things with each other's bodies.
45Rm 1:25 They traded the truth about God for a lie. So they worshiped and served the things God created instead of the Creator himself, who is worthy of eternal praise! Amen.
45Rm 1:26 That is why God abandoned them to their shameful desires. Even the women turned against the natural way to have sex and instead indulged in sex with each other.
45Rm 1:27 And the men, instead of having normal sexual relations with women, burned with lust for each other. Men did shameful things with other men, and as a result of this sin, they suffered within themselves the penalty they deserved.
45Rm 1:28 Since they thought it foolish to acknowledge God, he abandoned them to their foolish thinking and let them do things that should never be done.
45Rm 1:29 Their lives became full of every kind of wickedness, sin, greed, hate, envy, murder, quarreling, deception, malicious behavior, and gossip.
45Rm 1:30 They are backstabbers, haters of God, insolent, proud, and boastful. They invent new ways of sinning, and they disobey their parents.
45Rm 1:31 They refuse to understand, break their promises, are heartless, and have no mercy.
45Rm 1:32 They know God's justice requires that those who do these things deserve to die, yet they do them anyway. Worse yet, they encourage others to do them, too.
45Rm 2:1 You may think you can condemn such people, but you are just as bad, and you have no excuse! When you say they are wicked and should be punished, you are condemning yourself, for you who judge others do these very same things.
45Rm 2:2 And we know that God, in his justice, will punish anyone who does such things.
45Rm 2:3 Since you judge others for doing these things, why do you think you can avoid God's judgment when you do the same things?
45Rm 2:4 Don't you see how wonderfully kind, tolerant, and patient God is with you? Does this mean nothing to you? Can't you see that his kindness is intended to turn you from your sin?
45Rm 2:5 But because you are stubborn and refuse to turn from your sin, you are storing up terrible punishment for yourself. For a day of anger is coming, when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.
45Rm 2:6 He will judge everyone according to what they have done.
45Rm 2:7 He will give eternal life to those who keep on doing good, seeking after the glory and honor and immortality that God offers.
45Rm 2:8 But he will pour out his anger and wrath on those who live for themselves, who refuse to obey the truth and instead live lives of wickedness.
45Rm 2:9 There will be trouble and calamity for everyone who keeps on doing what is evil?for the Jew first and also for the Gentile��. / ��Greek also for the Greek; also in 2.10
45Rm 2:10 But there will be glory and honor and peace from God for all who do good?for the Jew first and also for the Gentile.
45Rm 2:11 For God does not show favoritism.
45Rm 2:12 When the Gentiles sin, they will be destroyed, even though they never had God's written law. And the Jews, who do have God's law, will be judged by that law when they fail to obey it.
45Rm 2:13 For merely listening to the law doesn't make us right with God. It is obeying the law that makes us right in his sight.
45Rm 2:14 Even Gentiles, who do not have God's written law, show that they know his law when they instinctively obey it, even without having heard it.
45Rm 2:15 They demonstrate that God's law is written in their hearts, for their own conscience and thoughts either accuse them or tell them they are doing right.
45Rm 2:16 And this is the message I proclaim?that the day is coming when God, through Christ Jesus, will judge everyone's secret life.
45Rm 2:17 You who call yourselves Jews are relying on God's law, and you boast about your special relationship with him.
45Rm 2:18 You know what he wants; you know what is right because you have been taught his law.
45Rm 2:19 You are convinced that you are a guide for the blind and a light for people who are lost in darkness.
45Rm 2:20 You think you can instruct the ignorant and teach children the ways of God. For you are certain that God's law gives you complete knowledge and truth.
45Rm 2:21 Well then, if you teach others, why don't you teach yourself? You tell others not to steal, but do you steal?
45Rm 2:22 You say it is wrong to commit adultery, but do you commit adultery? You condemn idolatry, but do you use items stolen from pagan temples?�� / ��Greek do you steal from temples?
45Rm 2:23 You are so proud of knowing the law, but you dishonor God by breaking it.
45Rm 2:24 No wonder the Scriptures say, "The Gentiles blaspheme the name of God because of you."�� / ��Isa 52.5 �� (Greek version)
45Rm 2:25 The Jewish ceremony of circumcision has value only if you obey God's law. But if you don't obey God's law, you are no better off than an uncircumcised Gentile.
45Rm 2:26 And if the Gentiles obey God's law, won't God declare them to be his own people?
45Rm 2:27 In fact, uncircumcised Gentiles who keep God's law will condemn you Jews who are circumcised and possess God's law but don't obey it.
45Rm 2:28 For you are not a true Jew just because you were born of Jewish parents or because you have gone through the ceremony of circumcision.
45Rm 2:29 No, a true Jew is one whose heart is right with God. And true circumcision is not merely obeying the letter of the law; rather, it is a change of heart produced by God's Spirit. And a person with a changed heart seeks praise�� from God, not from people. / ��Or receives praise
45Rm 3:1 Then what's the advantage of being a Jew? Is there any value in the ceremony of circumcision?
45Rm 3:2 Yes, there are great benefits! First of all, the Jews were entrusted with the whole revelation of God.�� / ��Greek the oracles of God
45Rm 3:3 True, some of them were unfaithful; but just because they were unfaithful, does that mean God will be unfaithful?
45Rm 3:4 Of course not! Even if everyone else is a liar, God is true. As the Scriptures say about him, "You will be proved right in what you say, and you will win your case in court."�� / ��Ps 51.4 (Greek version)
45Rm 3:5 "But," some might say, "our sinfulness serves a good purpose, for it helps people see how righteous God is. Isn't it unfair, then, for him to punish us?" (This is merely a human point of view.)
45Rm 3:6 Of course not! If God were not entirely fair, how would he be qualified to judge the world?
45Rm 3:7 "But," someone might still argue, "how can God condemn me as a sinner if my dishonesty highlights his truthfulness and brings him more glory?"
45Rm 3:8 And some people even slander us by claiming that we say, "The more we sin, the better it is!" Those who say such things deserve to be condemned.
45Rm 3:9 Well then, should we conclude that we Jews are better than others? No, not at all, for we have already shown that all people, whether Jews or Gentiles��, are under the power of sin. / ��Greek or Greeks
45Rm 3:10 As the Scriptures say, "No one is righteous - not even one.
45Rm 3:11 No one is truly wise; no one is seeking God.
45Rm 3:12 All have turned away; all have become useless. No one does good, not a single one."�� / ��Pss 14.1-3; 53.1-3 (Greek version)
45Rm 3:13 "Their talk is foul, like the stench from an open grave. Their tongues are filled with lies." "Snake venom drips from their lips."�� / ��Pss 5.9 (Greek version); 140.3
45Rm 3:14 "Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness."�� / ��Ps 10.7 (Greek version)
45Rm 3:15 "They rush to commit murder.
45Rm 3:16 Destruction and misery always follow them.
45Rm 3:17 They don't know where to find peace."�� / ��Isa 59.7-8
45Rm 3:18 "They have no fear of God at all."�� / ��Ps 36.1
45Rm 3:19 Obviously, the law applies to those to whom it was given, for its purpose is to keep people from having excuses, and to show that the entire world is guilty before God.
45Rm 3:20 For no one can ever be made right with God by doing what the law commands. The law simply shows us how sinful we are.
45Rm 3:21 But now God has shown us a way to be made right with him without keeping the requirements of the law, as was promised in the writings of Moses�� and the prophets long ago. / ��Greek in the law
45Rm 3:22 We are made right with God by placing our faith in Jesus Christ. And this is true for everyone who believes, no matter who we are.
45Rm 3:23 For everyone has sinned; we all fall short of God's glorious standard.
45Rm 3:24 Yet God, with undeserved kindness, declares that we are righteous. He did this through Christ Jesus when he freed us from the penalty for our sins.
45Rm 3:25 For God presented Jesus as the sacrifice for sin. People are made right with God when they believe that Jesus sacrificed his life, shedding his blood. This sacrifice shows that God was being fair when he held back and did not punish those who sinned in times past,
45Rm 3:26 for he was looking ahead and including them in what he would do in this present time. God did this to demonstrate his righteousness, for he himself is fair and just, and he declares sinners to be right in his sight when they believe in Jesus.
45Rm 3:27 Can we boast, then, that we have done anything to be accepted by God? No, because our acquittal is not based on obeying the law. It is based on faith.
45Rm 3:28 So we are made right with God through faith and not by obeying the law.
45Rm 3:29 After all, is God the God of the Jews only? Isn't he also the God of the Gentiles? Of course he is.
45Rm 3:30 There is only one God, and he makes people right with himself only by faith, whether they are Jews or Gentiles��. / ��Greek whether they are circumcised or uncircumcised
45Rm 3:31 Well then, if we emphasize faith, does this mean that we can forget about the law? Of course not! In fact, only when we have faith do we truly fulfill the law.
45Rm 4:1 Abraham was, humanly speaking, the founder of our Jewish nation. What did he discover about being made right with God?
45Rm 4:2 If his good deeds had made him acceptable to God, he would have had something to boast about. But that was not God's way.
45Rm 4:3 For the Scriptures tell us, "Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith."�� / ��Gen 15.6
45Rm 4:4 When people work, their wages are not a gift, but something they have earned.
45Rm 4:5 But people are counted as righteous, not because of their work, but because of their faith in God who forgives sinners.
45Rm 4:6 David also spoke of this when he described the happiness of those who are declared righteous without working for it.
45Rm 4:7 "Oh, what joy for those whose disobedience is forgiven, whose sins are put out of sight.
45Rm 4:8 Yes, what joy for those whose record the LORD has cleared of sin."�� / ��Ps 32.1-2 (Greek version)
45Rm 4:9 Now, is this blessing only for the Jews, or is it also for uncircumcised Gentiles?�� Well, we have been saying that Abraham was counted as righteous by God because of his faith. / ��Greek is this blessing only for the circumcised, or is it also for the uncircumcised?
45Rm 4:10 But how did this happen? Was he counted as righteous only after he was circumcised, or was it before he was circumcised? Clearly, God accepted Abraham before he was circumcised!
45Rm 4:11 Circumcision was a sign that Abraham already had faith and that God had already accepted him and declared him to be righteous?even before he was circumcised. So Abraham is the spiritual father of those who have faith but have not been circumcised. They are counted as righteous because of their faith.
45Rm 4:12 And Abraham is also the spiritual father of those who have been circumcised, but only if they have the same kind of faith Abraham had before he was circumcised.
45Rm 4:13 Clearly, God's promise to give the whole earth to Abraham and his descendants was based not on his obedience to God's law, but on a right relationship with God that comes by faith.
45Rm 4:14 If God's promise is only for those who obey the law, then faith is not necessary and the promise is pointless.
45Rm 4:15 For the law always brings punishment on those who try to obey it. (The only way to avoid breaking the law is to have no law to break!)
45Rm 4:16 So the promise is received by faith. It is given as a free gift. And we are all certain to receive it, whether or not we live according to the law of Moses, if we have faith like Abraham's. For Abraham is the father of all who believe.
45Rm 4:17 That is what the Scriptures mean when God told him, "I have made you the father of many nations."�� This happened because Abraham believed in the God who brings the dead back to life and who creates new things out of nothing. / ��Gen 17.5
45Rm 4:18 Even when there was no reason for hope, Abraham kept hoping?believing that he would become the father of many nations. For God had said to him, "That's how many descendants you will have!"�� / ��Gen 15.5
45Rm 4:19 And Abraham's faith did not weaken, even though, at about 100 years of age, he figured his body was as good as dead?and so was Sarah's womb.
45Rm 4:20 Abraham never wavered in believing God's promise. In fact, his faith grew stronger, and in this he brought glory to God.
45Rm 4:21 He was fully convinced that God is able to do whatever he promises.
45Rm 4:22 And because of Abraham's faith, God counted him as righteous.
45Rm 4:23 And when God counted him as righteous, it wasn't just for Abraham's benefit. It was recorded
45Rm 4:24 for our benefit, too, assuring us that God will also count us as righteous if we believe in him, the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
45Rm 4:25 He was handed over to die because of our sins, and he was raised to life to make us right with God.
45Rm 5:1 Therefore, since we have been made right in God's sight by faith, we have peace with God because of what Jesus Christ our Lord has done for us.
45Rm 5:2 Because of our faith, Christ has brought us into this place of undeserved privilege where we now stand, and we confidently and joyfully look forward to sharing God's glory.
45Rm 5:3 We can rejoice, too, when we run into problems and trials, for we know that they help us develop endurance.
45Rm 5:4 And endurance develops strength of character, and character strengthens our confident hope of salvation.
45Rm 5:5 And this hope will not lead to disappointment. For we know how dearly God loves us, because he has given us the Holy Spirit to fill our hearts with his love.
45Rm 5:6 When we were utterly helpless, Christ came at just the right time and died for us sinners.
45Rm 5:7 Now, most people would not be willing to die for an upright person, though someone might perhaps be willing to die for a person who is especially good.
45Rm 5:8 But God showed his great love for us by sending Christ to die for us while we were still sinners.
45Rm 5:9 And since we have been made right in God's sight by the blood of Christ, he will certainly save us from God's condemnation.
45Rm 5:10 For since our friendship with God was restored by the death of his Son while we were still his enemies, we will certainly be saved through the life of his Son.
45Rm 5:11 So now we can rejoice in our wonderful new relationship with God because our Lord Jesus Christ has made us friends of God.
45Rm 5:12 When Adam sinned, sin entered the world. Adam's sin brought death, so death spread to everyone, for everyone sinned.
45Rm 5:13 Yes, people sinned even before the law was given. But it was not counted as sin because there was not yet any law to break.
45Rm 5:14 Still, everyone died?from the time of Adam to the time of Moses - even those who did not disobey an explicit commandment of God, as Adam did. Now Adam is a symbol, a representation of Christ, who was yet to come.
45Rm 5:15 But there is a great difference between Adam's sin and God's gracious gift. For the sin of this one man, Adam, brought death to many. But even greater is God's wonderful grace and his gift of forgiveness to many through this other man, Jesus Christ.
45Rm 5:16 And the result of God's gracious gift is very different from the result of that one man's sin. For Adam's sin led to condemnation, but God's free gift leads to our being made right with God, even though we are guilty of many sins.
45Rm 5:17 For the sin of this one man, Adam, caused death to rule over many. But even greater is God's wonderful grace and his gift of righteousness, for all who receive it will live in triumph over sin and death through this one man, Jesus Christ.
45Rm 5:18 Yes, Adam's one sin brings condemnation for everyone, but Christ's one act of righteousness brings a right relationship with God and new life for everyone.
45Rm 5:19 Because one person disobeyed God, many became sinners. But because one other person obeyed God, many will be made righteous.
45Rm 5:20 God's law was given so that all people could see how sinful they were. But as people sinned more and more, God's wonderful grace became more abundant.
45Rm 5:21 So just as sin ruled over all people and brought them to death, now God's wonderful grace rules instead, giving us right standing with God and resulting in eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
45Rm 6:1 Well then, should we keep on sinning so that God can show us more and more of his wonderful grace?
45Rm 6:2 Of course not! Since we have died to sin, how can we continue to live in it?
45Rm 6:3 Or have you forgotten that when we were joined with Christ Jesus in baptism, we joined him in his death?
45Rm 6:4 For we died and were buried with Christ by baptism. And just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glorious power of the Father, now we also may live new lives.
45Rm 6:5 Since we have been united with him in his death, we will also be raised to life as he was.
45Rm 6:6 We know that our old sinful selves were crucified with Christ so that sin might lose its power in our lives. We are no longer slaves to sin.
45Rm 6:7 For when we died with Christ we were set free from the power of sin.
45Rm 6:8 And since we died with Christ, we know we will also live with him.
45Rm 6:9 We are sure of this because Christ was raised from the dead, and he will never die again. Death no longer has any power over him.
45Rm 6:10 When he died, he died once to break the power of sin. But now that he lives, he lives for the glory of God.
45Rm 6:11 So you also should consider yourselves to be dead to the power of sin and alive to God through Christ Jesus.
45Rm 6:12 Do not let sin control the way you live��; do not give in to sinful desires. / ��Or Do not let sin reign in your body, which is subject to death
45Rm 6:13 Do not let any part of your body become an instrument of evil to serve sin. Instead, give yourselves completely to God, for you were dead, but now you have new life. So use your whole body as an instrument to do what is right for the glory of God.
45Rm 6:14 Sin is no longer your master, for you no longer live under the requirements of the law. Instead, you live under the freedom of God's grace.
45Rm 6:15 Well then, since God's grace has set us free from the law, does that mean we can go on sinning? Of course not!
45Rm 6:16 Don't you realize that you become the slave of whatever you choose to obey? You can be a slave to sin, which leads to death, or you can choose to obey God, which leads to righteous living.
45Rm 6:17 Thank God! Once you were slaves of sin, but now you wholeheartedly obey this teaching we have given you.
45Rm 6:18 Now you are free from your slavery to sin, and you have become slaves to righteous living.
45Rm 6:19 Because of the weakness of your human nature, I am using the illustration of slavery to help you understand all this. Previously, you let yourselves be slaves to impurity and lawlessness, which led ever deeper into sin. Now you must give yourselves to be slaves to righteous living so that you will become holy.
45Rm 6:20 When you were slaves to sin, you were free from the obligation to do right.
45Rm 6:21 And what was the result? You are now ashamed of the things you used to do, things that end in eternal doom.
45Rm 6:22 But now you are free from the power of sin and have become slaves of God. Now you do those things that lead to holiness and result in eternal life.
45Rm 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life through Christ Jesus our Lord.
45Rm 7:1 Now, dear brothers and sisters�� - you who are familiar with the law - don't you know that the law applies only while a person is living? / ��Greek brothers; also in 7.4
45Rm 7:2 For example, when a woman marries, the law binds her to her husband as long as he is alive. But if he dies, the laws of marriage no longer apply to her.
45Rm 7:3 So while her husband is alive, she would be committing adultery if she married another man. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law and does not commit adultery when she remarries.
45Rm 7:4 So, my dear brothers and sisters, this is the point�� You died to the power of the law when you died with Christ. And now you are united with the one who was raised from the dead. As a result, we can produce a harvest of good deeds for God.
45Rm 7:5 When we were controlled by our old nature��, sinful desires were at work within us, and the law aroused these evil desires that produced a harvest of sinful deeds, resulting in death. / ��Greek When we were in the flesh
45Rm 7:6 But now we have been released from the law, for we died to it and are no longer captive to its power. Now we can serve God, not in the old way of obeying the letter of the law, but in the new way of living in the Spirit.
45Rm 7:7 Well then, am I suggesting that the law of God is sinful? Of course not! In fact, it was the law that showed me my sin. I would never have known that coveting is wrong if the law had not said, "You must not covet."�� / ��Exod 20.17; Deut 5.21
45Rm 7:8 But sin used this command to arouse all kinds of covetous desires within me! If there were no law, sin would not have that power.
45Rm 7:9 At one time I lived without understanding the law. But when I learned the command not to covet, for instance, the power of sin came to life,
45Rm 7:10 and I died. So I discovered that the law's commands, which were supposed to bring life, brought spiritual death instead.
45Rm 7:11 Sin took advantage of those commands and deceived me; it used the commands to kill me.
45Rm 7:12 But still, the law itself is holy, and its commands are holy and right and good.
45Rm 7:13 But how can that be? Did the law, which is good, cause my death? Of course not! Sin used what was good to bring about my condemnation to death. So we can see how terrible sin really is. It uses God's good commands for its own evil purposes.
45Rm 7:14 So the trouble is not with the law, for it is spiritual and good. The trouble is with me, for I am all too human, a slave to sin.
45Rm 7:15 I don't really understand myself, for I want to do what is right, but I don't do it. Instead, I do what I hate.
45Rm 7:16 But if I know that what I am doing is wrong, this shows that I agree that the law is good.
45Rm 7:17 So I am not the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it.
45Rm 7:18 And I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my sinful nature��. I want to do what is right, but I can't. / ��Greek my flesh; also in 7.25
45Rm 7:19 I want to do what is good, but I don't. I don't want to do what is wrong, but I do it anyway.
45Rm 7:20 But if I do what I don't want to do, I am not really the one doing wrong; it is sin living in me that does it.
45Rm 7:21 I have discovered this principle of life?that when I want to do what is right, I inevitably do what is wrong.
45Rm 7:22 I love God's law with all my heart.
45Rm 7:23 But there is another power�� within me that is at war with my mind. This power makes me a slave to the sin that is still within me. / ��Greek law
45Rm 7:24 Oh, what a miserable person I am! Who will free me from this life that is dominated by sin and death?
45Rm 7:25 Thank God! The answer is in Jesus Christ our Lord. So you see how it is�� In my mind I really want to obey God's law, but because of my sinful nature I am a slave to sin.
45Rm 8:1 So now there is no condemnation for those who belong to Christ Jesus.
45Rm 8:2 And because you belong to him, the power�� of the life-giving Spirit has freed you�� from the power of sin that leads to death. / ��Greek the law ��Some manuscripts read me
45Rm 8:3 The law of Moses was unable to save us because of the weakness of our sinful nature��. So God did what the law could not do. He sent his own Son in a body like the bodies we sinners have. And in that body God declared an end to sin's control over us by giving his Son as a sacrifice for our sins. / ��Greek our flesh; similarly in 8.4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12
45Rm 8:4 He did this so that the just requirement of the law would be fully satisfied for us, who no longer follow our sinful nature but instead follow the Spirit.
45Rm 8:5 Those who are dominated by the sinful nature think about sinful things, but those who are controlled by the Holy Spirit think about things that please the Spirit.
45Rm 8:6 So letting your sinful nature control your mind leads to death. But letting the Spirit control your mind leads to life and peace.
45Rm 8:7 For the sinful nature is always hostile to God. It never did obey God's laws, and it never will.
45Rm 8:8 That's why those who are still under the control of their sinful nature can never please God.
45Rm 8:9 But you are not controlled by your sinful nature. You are controlled by the Spirit if you have the Spirit of God living in you. (And remember that those who do not have the Spirit of Christ living in them do not belong to him at all.)
45Rm 8:10 And Christ lives within you, so even though your body will die because of sin, the Spirit gives you life�� because you have been made right with God. / ��Or your spirit is alive
45Rm 8:11 The Spirit of God, who raised Jesus from the dead, lives in you. And just as God raised Christ Jesus from the dead, he will give life to your mortal bodies by this same Spirit living within you.
45Rm 8:12 Therefore, dear brothers and sisters��, you have no obligation to do what your sinful nature urges you to do. / ��Greek brothers
45Rm 8:13 For if you live by its dictates, you will die. But if through the power of the Spirit you put to death the deeds of your sinful nature��, you will live. / ��Greek deeds of the body
45Rm 8:14 For all who are led by the Spirit of God are children�� of God. / ��Greek sons
45Rm 8:15 So you have not received a spirit that makes you fearful slaves. Instead, you received God's Spirit when he adopted you as his own children��. Now we call him, "Abba, Father."�� / ��Greek you received a spirit of sonship ��Abba is an Aramaic term for "father"
45Rm 8:16 For his Spirit joins with our spirit to affirm that we are God's children.
45Rm 8:17 And since we are his children, we are his heirs. In fact, together with Christ we are heirs of God's glory. But if we are to share his glory, we must also share his suffering.
45Rm 8:18 Yet what we suffer now is nothing compared to the glory he will reveal to us later.
45Rm 8:19 For all creation is waiting eagerly for that future day when God will reveal who his children�� really are. / ��Greek sons
45Rm 8:20 Against its will, all creation was subjected to God's curse. But with eager hope,
45Rm 8:21 the creation looks forward to the day when it will join God's children in glorious freedom from death and decay.
45Rm 8:22 For we know that all creation has been groaning as in the pains of childbirth right up to the present time.
45Rm 8:23 And we believers also groan, even though we have the Holy Spirit within us as a foretaste of future glory, for we long for our bodies to be released from sin and suffering. We, too, wait with eager hope for the day when God will give us our full rights as his adopted children��, including the new bodies he has promised us. / ��Greek wait anxiously for sonship
45Rm 8:24 We were given this hope when we were saved. [If we already have something, we don't need to hope�� for it. / ��Some manuscripts read wait
45Rm 8:25 But if we look forward to something we don't yet have, we must wait patiently and confidently.]
45Rm 8:26 And the Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness. For example, we don't know what God wants us to pray for. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words.
45Rm 8:27 And the Father who knows all hearts knows what the Spirit is saying, for the Spirit pleads for us believers�� in harmony with God's own will. / ��Greek for God's holy people
45Rm 8:28 And we know that God causes everything to work together�� for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them. / ��Some manuscripts read And we know that everything works together
45Rm 8:29 For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son, so that his Son would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters��. / ��Greek brothers
45Rm 8:30 And having chosen them, he called them to come to him. And having called them, he gave them right standing with himself. And having given them right standing, he gave them his glory.
45Rm 8:31 What shall we say about such wonderful things as these? If God is for us, who can ever be against us?
45Rm 8:32 Since he did not spare even his own Son but gave him up for us all, won't he also give us everything else?
45Rm 8:33 Who dares accuse us whom God has chosen for his own? No one?for God himself has given us right standing with himself.
45Rm 8:34 Who then will condemn us? No one?for Christ Jesus died for us and was raised to life for us, and he is sitting in the place of honor at God's right hand, pleading for us.
45Rm 8:35 Can anything ever separate us from Christ's love? Does it mean he no longer loves us if we have trouble or calamity, or are persecuted, or hungry, or destitute, or in danger, or threatened with death?
45Rm 8:36 (As the Scriptures say, "For your sake we are killed every day; we are being slaughtered like sheep."��) / ��Ps 44.22
45Rm 8:37 No, despite all these things, overwhelming victory is ours through Christ, who loved us.
45Rm 8:38 And I am convinced that nothing can ever separate us from God's love. Neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons��, neither our fears for today nor our worries about tomorrow?not even the powers of hell can separate us from God's love. / ��Greek nor rulers
45Rm 8:39 No power in the sky above or in the earth below?indeed, nothing in all creation will ever be able to separate us from the love of God that is revealed in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45Rm 9:1 With Christ as my witness, I speak with utter truthfulness. My conscience and the Holy Spirit confirm it.
45Rm 9:2 My heart is filled with bitter sorrow and unending grief
45Rm 9:3 for my people, my Jewish brothers and sisters��. I would be willing to be forever cursed?cut off from Christ!?if that would save them. / ��Greek my brothers
45Rm 9:4 They are the people of Israel, chosen to be God's adopted children��. God revealed his glory to them. He made covenants with them and gave them his law. He gave them the privilege of worshiping him and receiving his wonderful promises. / ��Greek chosen for sonship
45Rm 9:5 Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are their ancestors, and Christ himself was an Israelite as far as his human nature is concerned. And he is God, the one who rules over everything and is worthy of eternal praise! Amen.�� / ��Or May God, the one who rules over everything, be praised forever. Amen.
45Rm 9:6 Well then, has God failed to fulfill his promise to Israel? No, for not all who are born into the nation of Israel are truly members of God's people!
45Rm 9:7 Being descendants of Abraham doesn't make them truly Abraham's children. For the Scriptures say, "Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted,"�� though Abraham had other children, too. / ��Gen 21.12
45Rm 9:8 This means that Abraham's physical descendants are not necessarily children of God. Only the children of the promise are considered to be Abraham's children.
45Rm 9:9 For God had promised, "I will return about this time next year, and Sarah will have a son."�� / ��Gen 18.10, 14
45Rm 9:10 This son was our ancestor Isaac. When he married Rebekah, she gave birth to twins��. / ��Greek she conceived children through this one man.
45Rm 9:11 But before they were born, before they had done anything good or bad, she received a message from God. (This message shows that God chooses people according to his own purposes;
45Rm 9:12 he calls people, but not according to their good or bad works.) She was told, "Your older son will serve your younger son."�� / ��Gen 25.23
45Rm 9:13 In the words of the Scriptures, "I loved Jacob, but I rejected Esau."�� / ��Mal 1.2-3
45Rm 9:14 Are we saying, then, that God was unfair? Of course not!
45Rm 9:15 For God said to Moses, "I will show mercy to anyone I choose, and I will show compassion to anyone I choose."�� / ��Exod 33.19
45Rm 9:16 So it is God who decides to show mercy. We can neither choose it nor work for it.
45Rm 9:17 For the Scriptures say that God told Pharaoh, "I have appointed you for the very purpose of displaying my power in you and to spread my fame throughout the earth."�� / ��Exod 9.16 (Greek version)
45Rm 9:18 So you see, God chooses to show mercy to some, and he chooses to harden the hearts of others so they refuse to listen.
45Rm 9:19 Well then, you might say, "Why does God blame people for not responding? Haven't they simply done what he makes them do?"
45Rm 9:20 No, don't say that. Who are you, a mere human being, to argue with God? Should the thing that was created say to the one who created it, "Why have you made me like this?"
45Rm 9:21 When a potter makes jars out of clay, doesn't he have a right to use the same lump of clay to make one jar for decoration and another to throw garbage into?
45Rm 9:22 In the same way, even though God has the right to show his anger and his power, he is very patient with those on whom his anger falls, who are destined for destruction.
45Rm 9:23 He does this to make the riches of his glory shine even brighter on those to whom he shows mercy, who were prepared in advance for glory.
45Rm 9:24 And we are among those whom he selected, both from the Jews and from the Gentiles.
45Rm 9:25 Concerning the Gentiles, God says in the prophecy of Hosea, "Those who were not my people, I will now call my people. And I will love those whom I did not love before."�� / ��Hos 2.23
45Rm 9:26 And, "Then, at the place where they were told, `You are not my people,' there they will be called `children of the living God.'"�� / ��Greek sons of the living God. Hos 1.10
45Rm 9:27 And concerning Israel, Isaiah the prophet cried out, "Though the people of Israel are as numerous as the sand of the seashore, only a remnant will be saved.
45Rm 9:28 For the LORD will carry out his sentence upon the earth quickly and with finality."�� / ��Isa 10.22-23 (Greek version)
45Rm 9:29 And Isaiah said the same thing in another place�� "If the LORD of Heaven's Armies had not spared a few of our children, we would have been wiped out like Sodom, destroyed like Gomorrah."�� / ��Isa 1.9
45Rm 9:30 What does all this mean? Even though the Gentiles were not trying to follow God's standards, they were made right with God. And it was by faith that this took place.
45Rm 9:31 But the people of Israel, who tried so hard to get right with God by keeping the law, never succeeded.
45Rm 9:32 Why not? Because they were trying to get right with God by keeping the law�� instead of by trusting in him. They stumbled over the great rock in their path. / ��Greek by works
45Rm 9:33 God warned them of this in the Scriptures when he said, "I am placing a stone in Jerusalem�� that makes people stumble, a rock that makes them fall. But anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced."�� / ��Greek in Zion ��Isa 8.14; 28.16 (Greek version)
45Rm 10:1 Dear brothers and sisters��, the longing of my heart and my prayer to God is for the people of Israel to be saved. / ��Greek Brothers
45Rm 10:2 I know what enthusiasm they have for God, but it is misdirected zeal.
45Rm 10:3 For they don't understand God's way of making people right with himself. Refusing to accept God's way, they cling to their own way of getting right with God by trying to keep the law.
45Rm 10:4 For Christ has already accomplished the purpose for which the law was given��. As a result, all who believe in him are made right with God. / ��Or For Christ is the end of the law
45Rm 10:5 For Moses writes that the law's way of making a person right with God requires obedience to all of its commands.�� / ��See Lev 18.5
45Rm 10:6 But faith's way of getting right with God says, "Don't say in your heart, `Who will go up to heaven' ��. / ��to bring Christ down to earth
45Rm 10:7 And don't say, `Who will go down to the place of the dead' (to bring Christ back to life again.)"
45Rm 10:8 In fact, it says, "The message is very close at hand; it is on your lips and in your heart."�� And that message is the very message about faith that we preach. / ��Deut 30.12-14
45Rm 10:9 If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
45Rm 10:10 For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with God, and it is by confessing with your mouth that you are saved.
45Rm 10:11 As the Scriptures tell us, "Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced."�� / ��Isa 28.16 (Greek version)
45Rm 10:12 Jew and Gentile�� are the same in this respect. They have the same Lord, who gives generously to all who call on him. / ��Greek and Greek
45Rm 10:13 For "Everyone who calls on the name of the LORD will be saved."�� / ��Joel 2.32
45Rm 10:14 But how can they call on him to save them unless they believe in him? And how can they believe in him if they have never heard about him? And how can they hear about him unless someone tells them?
45Rm 10:15 And how will anyone go and tell them without being sent? That is why the Scriptures say, "How beautiful are the feet of messengers who bring good news!"�� / ��Isa 52.7
45Rm 10:16 But not everyone welcomes the Good News, for Isaiah the prophet said, "LORD, who has believed our message?"�� / ��Isa 53.1
45Rm 10:17 So faith comes from hearing, that is, hearing the Good News about Christ.
45Rm 10:18 But I ask, have the people of Israel actually heard the message? Yes, they have�� "The message has gone throughout the earth, and the words to all the world."�� / ��Ps 19.4
45Rm 10:19 But I ask, did the people of Israel really understand? Yes, they did, for even in the time of Moses, God said, "I will rouse your jealousy through people who are not even a nation. I will provoke your anger through the foolish Gentiles."�� / ��Deut 32.21
45Rm 10:20 And later Isaiah spoke boldly for God, saying, "I was found by people who were not looking for me. I showed myself to those who were not asking for me."�� / ��Isa 65.1 (Greek version)
45Rm 10:21 But regarding Israel, God said, "All day long I opened my arms to them, but they were disobedient and rebellious."�� / ��Isa 65.2 (Greek version)
45Rm 11:1 I ask, then, has God rejected his own people, the nation of Israel? Of course not! I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham and a member of the tribe of Benjamin.
45Rm 11:2 No, God has not rejected his own people, whom he chose from the very beginning. Do you realize what the Scriptures say about this? Elijah the prophet complained to God about the people of Israel and said,
45Rm 11:3 "LORD, they have killed your prophets and torn down your altars. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me, too."�� / ��1 Kgs 19.10, 14
45Rm 11:4 And do you remember God's reply? He said, "No, I have 7,000 others who have never bowed down to Baal!"�� / ��1 Kgs 19.18
45Rm 11:5 It is the same today, for a few of the people of Israel�� have remained faithful because of God's grace - his undeserved kindness in choosing them. / ��Greek for a remnant
45Rm 11:6 And since it is through God's kindness, then it is not by their good works. For in that case, God's grace would not be what it really is?free and undeserved.
45Rm 11:7 So this is the situation�� Most of the people of Israel have not found the favor of God they are looking for so earnestly. A few have?the ones God has chosen?but the hearts of the rest were hardened.
45Rm 11:8 As the Scriptures say, "God has put them into a deep sleep. To this day he has shut their eyes so they do not see, and closed their ears so they do not hear."�� / ��Isa 29.10; Deut 29.4
45Rm 11:9 Likewise, David said, "Let their bountiful table become a snare, a trap that makes them think all is well. Let their blessings cause them to stumble, and let them get what they deserve.
45Rm 11:10 Let their eyes go blind so they cannot see, and let their backs be bent forever."�� / ��Ps 69.22-23 (Greek version)
45Rm 11:11 Did God's people stumble and fall beyond recovery? Of course not! They were disobedient, so God made salvation available to the Gentiles. But he wanted his own people to become jealous and claim it for themselves.
45Rm 11:12 Now if the Gentiles were enriched because the people of Israel turned down God's offer of salvation, think how much greater a blessing the world will share when they finally accept it.
45Rm 11:13 I am saying all this especially for you Gentiles. God has appointed me as the apostle to the Gentiles. I stress this,
45Rm 11:14 for I want somehow to make the people of Israel jealous of what you Gentiles have, so I might save some of them.
45Rm 11:15 For since their rejection meant that God offered salvation to the rest of the world, their acceptance will be even more wonderful. It will be life for those who were dead!
45Rm 11:16 And since Abraham and the other patriarchs were holy, their descendants will also be holy?just as the entire batch of dough is holy because the portion given as an offering is holy. For if the roots of the tree are holy, the branches will be, too.
45Rm 11:17 But some of these branches from Abraham's tree?some of the people of Israel?have been broken off. And you Gentiles, who were branches from a wild olive tree, have been grafted in. So now you also receive the blessing God has promised Abraham and his children, sharing in the rich nourishment from the root of God's special olive tree.
45Rm 11:18 But you must not brag about being grafted in to replace the branches that were broken off. You are just a branch, not the root.
45Rm 11:19 "Well," you may say, "those branches were broken off to make room for me."
45Rm 11:20 Yes, but remember?those branches were broken off because they didn't believe in Christ, and you are there because you do believe. So don't think highly of yourself, but fear what could happen.
45Rm 11:21 For if God did not spare the original branches, he won't�� spare you either. / ��Some manuscripts read perhaps he won't
45Rm 11:22 Notice how God is both kind and severe. He is severe toward those who disobeyed, but kind to you if you continue to trust in his kindness. But if you stop trusting, you also will be cut off.
45Rm 11:23 And if the people of Israel turn from their unbelief, they will be grafted in again, for God has the power to graft them back into the tree.
45Rm 11:24 You, by nature, were a branch cut from a wild olive tree. So if God was willing to do something contrary to nature by grafting you into his cultivated tree, he will be far more eager to graft the original branches back into the tree where they belong.
45Rm 11:25 I want you to understand this mystery, dear brothers and sisters��, so that you will not feel proud about yourselves. Some of the people of Israel have hard hearts, but this will last only until the full number of Gentiles comes to Christ. / ��Greek brothers
45Rm 11:26 And so all Israel will be saved. As the Scriptures say, "The one who rescues will come from Jerusalem��, and he will turn Israel�� away from ungodliness. / ��Greek from Zion ��Greek Jacob
45Rm 11:27 And this is my covenant with them, that I will take away their sins."�� / ��Isa 59.20-21; 27.9 (Greek version)
45Rm 11:28 Many of the people of Israel are now enemies of the Good News, and this benefits you Gentiles. Yet they are still the people he loves because he chose their ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
45Rm 11:29 For God's gifts and his call can never be withdrawn.
45Rm 11:30 Once, you Gentiles were rebels against God, but when the people of Israel rebelled against him, God was merciful to you instead.
45Rm 11:31 Now they are the rebels, and God's mercy has come to you so that they, too, will share�� in God's mercy. / ��Other manuscripts read will now share; still others read will someday share
45Rm 11:32 For God has imprisoned everyone in disobedience so he could have mercy on everyone.
45Rm 11:33 Oh, how great are God's riches and wisdom and knowledge! How impossible it is for us to understand his decisions and his ways!
45Rm 11:34 For who can know the LORD's thoughts? Who knows enough to give him advice?�� / ��Isa 40.13 (Greek version)
45Rm 11:35 And who has given him so much that he needs to pay it back?�� / ��See Job 41.11
45Rm 11:36 For everything comes from him and exists by his power and is intended for his glory. All glory to him forever! Amen.
45Rm 12:1 And so, dear brothers and sisters��, I plead with you to give your bodies to God because of all he has done for you. Let them be a living and holy sacrifice - the kind he will find acceptable. This is truly the way to worship him.�� / ��Greek brothers ��Or This is your spiritual worship; or This is your reasonable service
45Rm 12:2 Don't copy the behavior and customs of this world, but let God transform you into a new person by changing the way you think. Then you will learn to know God's will for you, which is good and pleasing and perfect.
45Rm 12:3 Because of the privilege and authority�� God has given me, I give each of you this warning�� Don't think you are better than you really are. Be honest in your evaluation of yourselves, measuring yourselves by the faith God has given us.�� / ��Or Because of the grace; compare 1.5 ��Or by the faith God has given you; or by the standard of our God-given faith
45Rm 12:4 Just as our bodies have many parts and each part has a special function,
45Rm 12:5 so it is with Christ's body. We are many parts of one body, and we all belong to each other.
45Rm 12:6 In his grace, God has given us different gifts for doing certain things well. So if God has given you the ability to prophesy, speak out with as much faith as God has given you.
45Rm 12:7 If your gift is serving others, serve them well. If you are a teacher, teach well.
45Rm 12:8 If your gift is to encourage others, be encouraging. If it is giving, give generously. If God has given you leadership ability, take the responsibility seriously. And if you have a gift for showing kindness to others, do it gladly.
45Rm 12:9 Don't just pretend to love others. Really love them. Hate what is wrong. Hold tightly to what is good.
45Rm 12:10 Love each other with genuine affection��, and take delight in honoring each other. / ��Greek with brotherly love
45Rm 12:11 Never be lazy, but work hard and serve the Lord enthusiastically��. / ��Or but serve the Lord with a zealous spirit; or but let the Spirit excite you as you serve the Lord
45Rm 12:12 Rejoice in our confident hope. Be patient in trouble, and keep on praying.
45Rm 12:13 When God's people are in need, be ready to help them. Always be eager to practice hospitality.
45Rm 12:14 Bless those who persecute you. Don't curse them; pray that God will bless them.
45Rm 12:15 Be happy with those who are happy, and weep with those who weep.
45Rm 12:16 Live in harmony with each other. Don't be too proud to enjoy the company of ordinary people. And don't think you know it all!
45Rm 12:17 Never pay back evil with more evil. Do things in such a way that everyone can see you are honorable.
45Rm 12:18 Do all that you can to live in peace with everyone.
45Rm 12:19 Dear friends, never take revenge. Leave that to the righteous anger of God. For the Scriptures say, "I will take revenge; I will pay them back,"�� / ��Deut 32.35 says the LORD.
45Rm 12:20 Instead, "If your enemies are hungry, feed them. If they are thirsty, give them something to drink. In doing this, you will heap burning coals of shame on their heads."�� / ��Prov 25.21-22
45Rm 12:21 Don't let evil conquer you, but conquer evil by doing good.
45Rm 13:1 Everyone must submit to governing authorities. For all authority comes from God, and those in positions of authority have been placed there by God.
45Rm 13:2 So anyone who rebels against authority is rebelling against what God has instituted, and they will be punished.
45Rm 13:3 For the authorities do not strike fear in people who are doing right, but in those who are doing wrong. Would you like to live without fear of the authorities? Do what is right, and they will honor you.
45Rm 13:4 The authorities are God's servants, sent for your good. But if you are doing wrong, of course you should be afraid, for they have the power to punish you. They are God's servants, sent for the very purpose of punishing those who do what is wrong.
45Rm 13:5 So you must submit to them, not only to avoid punishment, but also to keep a clear conscience.
45Rm 13:6 Pay your taxes, too, for these same reasons. For government workers need to be paid. They are serving God in what they do.
45Rm 13:7 Give to everyone what you owe them�� Pay your taxes and government fees to those who collect them, and give respect and honor to those who are in authority.
45Rm 13:8 Owe nothing to anyone?except for your obligation to love one another. If you love your neighbor, you will fulfill the requirements of God's law.
45Rm 13:9 For the commandments say, "You must not commit adultery. You must not murder. You must not steal. You must not covet."�� These - and other such commandments - are summed up in this one commandment�� "Love your neighbor as yourself."�� / ��Exod 20.13-15, 17 ��Lev 19.18
45Rm 13:10 Love does no wrong to others, so love fulfills the requirements of God's law.
45Rm 13:11 This is all the more urgent, for you know how late it is; time is running out. Wake up, for our salvation is nearer now than when we first believed.
45Rm 13:12 The night is almost gone; the day of salvation will soon be here. So remove your dark deeds like dirty clothes, and put on the shining armor of right living.
45Rm 13:13 Because we belong to the day, we must live decent lives for all to see. Don't participate in the darkness of wild parties and drunkenness, or in sexual promiscuity and immoral living, or in quarreling and jealousy.
45Rm 13:14 Instead, clothe yourself with the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ. And don't let yourself think about ways to indulge your evil desires.
45Rm 14:1 Accept other believers who are weak in faith, and don't argue with them about what they think is right or wrong.
45Rm 14:2 For instance, one person believes it's all right to eat anything. But another believer with a sensitive conscience will eat only vegetables.
45Rm 14:3 Those who feel free to eat anything must not look down on those who don't. And those who don't eat certain foods must not condemn those who do, for God has accepted them.
45Rm 14:4 Who are you to condemn someone else's servants? They are responsible to the Lord, so let him judge whether they are right or wrong. And with the Lord's help, they will do what is right and will receive his approval.
45Rm 14:5 In the same way, some think one day is more holy than another day, while others think every day is alike. You should each be fully convinced that whichever day you choose is acceptable.
45Rm 14:6 Those who worship the Lord on a special day do it to honor him. Those who eat any kind of food do so to honor the Lord, since they give thanks to God before eating. And those who refuse to eat certain foods also want to please the Lord and give thanks to God.
45Rm 14:7 For we don't live for ourselves or die for ourselves.
45Rm 14:8 If we live, it's to honor the Lord. And if we die, it's to honor the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
45Rm 14:9 Christ died and rose again for this very purpose?to be Lord both of the living and of the dead.
45Rm 14:10 So why do you condemn another believer��? Why do you look down on another believer? Remember, we will all stand before the judgment seat of God. / ��Greek your brother; also in 14.10b, 13, 15, 21
45Rm 14:11 For the Scriptures say, "`As surely as I live,' says the LORD, `every knee will bend to me, and every tongue will confess and give praise to God.��'" / ��Or confess allegiance to God. Isa 49.18; 45.23 (Greek version)
45Rm 14:12 Yes, each of us will give a personal account to God.
45Rm 14:13 So let's stop condemning each other. Decide instead to live in such a way that you will not cause another believer to stumble and fall.
45Rm 14:14 I know and am convinced on the authority of the Lord Jesus that no food, in and of itself, is wrong to eat. But if someone believes it is wrong, then for that person it is wrong.
45Rm 14:15 And if another believer is distressed by what you eat, you are not acting in love if you eat it. Don't let your eating ruin someone for whom Christ died.
45Rm 14:16 Then you will not be criticized for doing something you believe is good.
45Rm 14:17 For the Kingdom of God is not a matter of what we eat or drink, but of living a life of goodness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 14:18 If you serve Christ with this attitude, you will please God, and others will approve of you, too.
45Rm 14:19 So then, let us aim for harmony in the church and try to build each other up.
45Rm 14:20 Don't tear apart the work of God over what you eat. Remember, all foods are acceptable, but it is wrong to eat something if it makes another person stumble.
45Rm 14:21 It is better not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything else if it might cause another believer to stumble.
45Rm 14:22 You may believe there's nothing wrong with what you are doing, but keep it between yourself and God. Blessed are those who don't feel guilty for doing something they have decided is right.
45Rm 14:23 But if you have doubts about whether or not you should eat something, you are sinning if you go ahead and do it. For you are not following your convictions. If you do anything you believe is not right, you are sinning.
45Rm 15:1 We who are strong must be considerate of those who are sensitive about things like this. We must not just please ourselves.
45Rm 15:2 We should help others do what is right and build them up in the Lord.
45Rm 15:3 For even Christ didn't live to please himself. As the Scriptures say, "The insults of those who insult you, O God, have fallen on me."�� / ��Greek who insult you have fallen on me. Ps 69.9
45Rm 15:4 Such things were written in the Scriptures long ago to teach us. And the Scriptures give us hope and encouragement as we wait patiently for God's promises to be fulfilled.
45Rm 15:5 May God, who gives this patience and encouragement, help you live in complete harmony with each other, as is fitting for followers of Christ Jesus.
45Rm 15:6 Then all of you can join together with one voice, giving praise and glory to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
45Rm 15:7 Therefore, accept each other just as Christ has accepted you so that God will be given glory.
45Rm 15:8 Remember that Christ came as a servant to the Jews�� to show that God is true to the promises he made to their ancestors. / ��Greek servant of circumcision
45Rm 15:9 He also came so that the Gentiles might give glory to God for his mercies to them. That is what the psalmist meant when he wrote�� "For this, I will praise you among the Gentiles; I will sing praises to your name."�� / ��Ps 18.49
45Rm 15:10 And in another place it is written, "Rejoice with his people, you Gentiles."�� / ��Deut 32.43
45Rm 15:11 And yet again, "Praise the LORD, all you Gentiles. Praise him, all you people of the earth."�� / ��Ps 117.1
45Rm 15:12 And in another place Isaiah said, "The heir to David's throne�� will come, and he will rule over the Gentiles. They will place their hope on him."�� / ��Greek The root of Jesse. David was the son of Jesse ��Isa 11.10 (Greek version)
45Rm 15:13 I pray that God, the source of hope, will fill you completely with joy and peace because you trust in him. Then you will overflow with confident hope through the power of the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 15:14 I am fully convinced, my dear brothers and sisters��, that you are full of goodness. You know these things so well you can teach each other all about them. / ��Greek brothers; also in 15.30
45Rm 15:15 Even so, I have been bold enough to write about some of these points, knowing that all you need is this reminder. For by God's grace,
45Rm 15:16 I am a special messenger from Christ Jesus to you Gentiles. I bring you the Good News so that I might present you as an acceptable offering to God, made holy by the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 15:17 So I have reason to be enthusiastic about all Christ Jesus has done through me in my service to God.
45Rm 15:18 Yet I dare not boast about anything except what Christ has done through me, bringing the Gentiles to God by my message and by the way I worked among them.
45Rm 15:19 They were convinced by the power of miraculous signs and wonders and by the power of God's Spirit��. In this way, I have fully presented the Good News of Christ from Jerusalem all the way to Illyricum��. / ��Other manuscripts read the Spirit; still others read the Holy Spirit ��Illyricum was a region northeast of Italy
45Rm 15:20 My ambition has always been to preach the Good News where the name of Christ has never been heard, rather than where a church has already been started by someone else.
45Rm 15:21 I have been following the plan spoken of in the Scriptures, where it says, "Those who have never been told about him will see, and those who have never heard of him will understand."�� / ��Isa 52.15 (Greek version)
45Rm 15:22 In fact, my visit to you has been delayed so long because I have been preaching in these places.
45Rm 15:23 But now I have finished my work in these regions, and after all these long years of waiting, I am eager to visit you.
45Rm 15:24 I am planning to go to Spain, and when I do, I will stop off in Rome. And after I have enjoyed your fellowship for a little while, you can provide for my journey.
45Rm 15:25 But before I come, I must go to Jerusalem to take a gift to the believers�� there. / ��Greek God's holy people; also in 15.26, 31
45Rm 15:26 For you see, the believers in Macedonia and Achaia�� have eagerly taken up an offering for the poor among the believers in Jerusalem. / ��Macedonia and Achaia were the northern and southern regions of Greece.
45Rm 15:27 They were glad to do this because they feel they owe a real debt to them. Since the Gentiles received the spiritual blessings of the Good News from the believers in Jerusalem, they feel the least they can do in return is to help them financially.
45Rm 15:28 As soon as I have delivered this money and completed this good deed of theirs, I will come to see you on my way to Spain.
45Rm 15:29 And I am sure that when I come, Christ will richly bless our time together.
45Rm 15:30 Dear brothers and sisters, I urge you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to join in my struggle by praying to God for me. Do this because of your love for me, given to you by the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 15:31 Pray that I will be rescued from those in Judea who refuse to obey God. Pray also that the believers there will be willing to accept the donation�� I am taking to Jerusalem.
45Rm 15:32 Then, by the will of God, I will be able to come to you with a joyful heart, and we will be an encouragement to each other.
45Rm 15:33 And now may God, who gives us his peace, be with you all. Amen.�� / ��Some manuscripts omit Amen. One very early manuscript places 16.25-27 here
45Rm 16:1 I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deacon in the church in Cenchrea.
45Rm 16:2 Welcome her in the Lord as one who is worthy of honor among God's people. Help her in whatever she needs, for she has been helpful to many, and especially to me.
45Rm 16:3 Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila, my co-workers in the ministry of Christ Jesus.
45Rm 16:4 In fact, they once risked their lives for me. I am thankful to them, and so are all the Gentile churches.
45Rm 16:5 Also give my greetings to the church that meets in their home. Greet my dear friend Epenetus. He was the first person from the province of Asia to become a follower of Christ.
45Rm 16:6 Give my greetings to Mary, who has worked so hard for your benefit.
45Rm 16:7 Greet Andronicus and Junia��, my fellow Jews��, who were in prison with me. They are highly respected among the apostles and became followers of Christ before I did. / ��Junia is a feminine name. Some late manuscripts accent the word so it reads Junias, a masculine name; still others read Julia (feminine) ��Or compatriots; also in 16.21
45Rm 16:8 Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord.
45Rm 16:9 Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in Christ, and my dear friend Stachys.
45Rm 16:10 Greet Apelles, a good man whom Christ approves. And give my greetings to the believers from the household of Aristobulus.
45Rm 16:11 Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew��. Greet the Lord's people from the household of Narcissus. / ��Or compatriot
45Rm 16:12 Give my greetings to Tryphena and Tryphosa, the Lord's workers, and to dear Persis, who has worked so hard for the Lord.
45Rm 16:13 Greet Rufus, whom the Lord picked out to be his very own; and also his dear mother, who has been a mother to me.
45Rm 16:14 Give my greetings to Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers and sisters�� who meet with them. / ��Greek brothers
45Rm 16:15 Give my greetings to Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and to Olympas and all the believers�� who meet with them. / ��Greek all of God's holy people
45Rm 16:16 Greet each other in Christian love��. All the churches of Christ send you their greetings. / ��Greek with a sacred kiss
45Rm 16:17 And now I make one more appeal, my dear brothers and sisters��. Watch out for people who cause divisions and upset people's faith by teaching things contrary to what you have been taught. Stay away from them. / ��Greek brothers
45Rm 16:18 Such people are not serving Christ our Lord; they are serving their own personal interests. By smooth talk and glowing words they deceive innocent people.
45Rm 16:19 But everyone knows that you are obedient to the Lord. This makes me very happy. I want you to be wise in doing right and to stay innocent of any wrong.
45Rm 16:20 The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. May the grace of our Lord Jesus�� be with you. / ��Some manuscripts read Lord Jesus Christ
45Rm 16:21 Timothy, my fellow worker, sends you his greetings, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my fellow Jews.
45Rm 16:22 I, Tertius, the one writing this letter for Paul, send my greetings, too, as one of the Lord's followers.
45Rm 16:23 Gaius says hello to you. He is my host and also serves as host to the whole church. Erastus, the city treasurer, sends you his greetings, and so does our brother Quartus.��
45Rm 16:24 �� / ��Some manuscripts add verse 24, May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen. Still others add this sentence after verse 27.
45Rm 16:25 Now all glory to God, who is able to make you strong, just as my Good News says. This message about Jesus Christ has revealed his plan for you Gentiles, a plan kept secret from the beginning of time.
45Rm 16:26 But now as the prophets�� foretold and as the eternal God has commanded, this message is made known to all Gentiles everywhere, so that they too might believe and obey him. / ��Greek the prophetic writings
45Rm 16:27 All glory to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, forever. Amen.

461Co 1:1 This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Sosthenes.
461Co 1:2 I am writing to God's church in Corinth��, to you who have been called by God to be his own holy people. He made you holy by means of Christ Jesus��, just as he did for all people everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, their Lord and ours. / ��Corinth was the capital city of Achaia, the southern region of the Greek peninsula ��Or because you belong to Christ Jesus
461Co 1:3 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
461Co 1:4 I always thank my God for you and for the gracious gifts he has given you, now that you belong to Christ Jesus.
461Co 1:5 Through him, God has enriched your church in every way - with all of your eloquent words and all of your knowledge.
461Co 1:6 This confirms that what I told you about Christ is true.
461Co 1:7 Now you have every spiritual gift you need as you eagerly wait for the return of our Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 1:8 He will keep you strong to the end so that you will be free from all blame on the day when our Lord Jesus Christ returns.
461Co 1:9 God will do this, for he is faithful to do what he says, and he has invited you into partnership with his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
461Co 1:10 I appeal to you, dear brothers and sisters��, by the authority of our Lord Jesus Christ, to live in harmony with each other. Let there be no divisions in the church. Rather, be of one mind, united in thought and purpose. / ��Greek brothers; also in 1.11, 26
461Co 1:11 For some members of Chloe's household have told me about your quarrels, my dear brothers and sisters.
461Co 1:12 Some of you are saying, "I am a follower of Paul." Others are saying, "I follow Apollos," or "I follow Peter��," or "I follow only Christ." / ��Greek Cephas
461Co 1:13 Has Christ been divided into factions? Was I, Paul, crucified for you? Were any of you baptized in the name of Paul? Of course not!
461Co 1:14 I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
461Co 1:15 for now no one can say they were baptized in my name.
461Co 1:16 (Oh yes, I also baptized the household of Stephanas, but I don't remember baptizing anyone else.)
461Co 1:17 For Christ didn't send me to baptize, but to preach the Good News?and not with clever speech, for fear that the cross of Christ would lose its power.
461Co 1:18 The message of the cross is foolish to those who are headed for destruction! But we who are being saved know it is the very power of God.
461Co 1:19 As the Scriptures say, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and discard the intelligence of the intelligent."�� / ��Isa 29.14
461Co 1:20 So where does this leave the philosophers, the scholars, and the world's brilliant debaters? God has made the wisdom of this world look foolish.
461Co 1:21 Since God in his wisdom saw to it that the world would never know him through human wisdom, he has used our foolish preaching to save those who believe.
461Co 1:22 It is foolish to the Jews, who ask for signs from heaven. And it is foolish to the Greeks, who seek human wisdom.
461Co 1:23 So when we preach that Christ was crucified, the Jews are offended and the Gentiles say it's all nonsense.
461Co 1:24 But to those called by God to salvation, both Jews and Gentiles��, Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. / ��Greek and Greeks
461Co 1:25 This foolish plan of God is wiser than the wisest of human plans, and God's weakness is stronger than the greatest of human strength.
461Co 1:26 Remember, dear brothers and sisters, that few of you were wise in the world's eyes or powerful or wealthy�� when God called you. / ��Or high born
461Co 1:27 Instead, God chose things the world considers foolish in order to shame those who think they are wise. And he chose things that are powerless to shame those who are powerful.
461Co 1:28 God chose things despised by the world��, things counted as nothing at all, and used them to bring to nothing what the world considers important. / ��Or God chose those who are low born
461Co 1:29 As a result, no one can ever boast in the presence of God.
461Co 1:30 God has united you with Christ Jesus. For our benefit God made him to be wisdom itself. Christ made us right with God; he made us pure and holy, and he freed us from sin.
461Co 1:31 Therefore, as the Scriptures say, "If you want to boast, boast only about the LORD."�� / ��Jer 9.24
461Co 2:1 When I first came to you, dear brothers and sisters��, I didn't use lofty words and impressive wisdom to tell you God's secret plan��. / ��Greek brothers ��Greek God's mystery; other manuscripts read God's testimony
461Co 2:2 For I decided that while I was with you I would forget everything except Jesus Christ, the one who was crucified.
461Co 2:3 I came to you in weakness?timid and trembling.
461Co 2:4 And my message and my preaching were very plain. Rather than using clever and persuasive speeches, I relied only on the power of the Holy Spirit.
461Co 2:5 I did this so you would trust not in human wisdom but in the power of God.
461Co 2:6 Yet when I am among mature believers, I do speak with words of wisdom, but not the kind of wisdom that belongs to this world or to the rulers of this world, who are soon forgotten.
461Co 2:7 No, the wisdom we speak of is the mystery of God�� - his plan that was previously hidden, even though he made it for our ultimate glory before the world began. / ��Greek But we speak God's wisdom in a mystery
461Co 2:8 But the rulers of this world have not understood it; if they had, they would not have crucified our glorious Lord.
461Co 2:9 That is what the Scriptures mean when they say, "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined what God has prepared for those who love him."�� / ��Isa 64.4
461Co 2:10 But�� it was to us that God revealed these things by his Spirit. For his Spirit searches out everything and shows us God's deep secrets. / ��Some manuscripts read For
461Co 2:11 No one can know a person's thoughts except that person's own spirit, and no one can know God's thoughts except God's own Spirit.
461Co 2:12 And we have received God's Spirit (not the world's spirit), so we can know the wonderful things God has freely given us.
461Co 2:13 When we tell you these things, we do not use words that come from human wisdom. Instead, we speak words given to us by the Spirit, using the Spirit's words to explain spiritual truths��. / ��Or explaining spiritual truths in spiritual language, or explaining spiritual truths to spiritual people
461Co 2:14 But people who aren't spiritual�� can't receive these truths from God's Spirit. It all sounds foolish to them and they can't understand it, for only those who are spiritual can understand what the Spirit means. / ��Or who don't have the Spirit; or who have only physical life
461Co 2:15 Those who are spiritual can evaluate all things, but they themselves cannot be evaluated by others.
461Co 2:16 For, "Who can know the LORD's thoughts? Who knows enough to teach him?"�� But we understand these things, for we have the mind of Christ. / ��Isa 40.13 (Greek version)
461Co 3:1 Dear brothers and sisters��, when I was with you I couldn't talk to you as I would to spiritual people��. I had to talk as though you belonged to this world or as though you were infants in the Christian life��. / ��Greek Brothers ��Or to people who have the Spirit ��Greek in Christ
461Co 3:2 I had to feed you with milk, not with solid food, because you weren't ready for anything stronger. And you still aren't ready,
461Co 3:3 for you are still controlled by your sinful nature. You are jealous of one another and quarrel with each other. Doesn't that prove you are controlled by your sinful nature? Aren't you living like people of the world?
461Co 3:4 When one of you says, "I am a follower of Paul," and another says, "I follow Apollos," aren't you acting just like people of the world?
461Co 3:5 After all, who is Apollos? Who is Paul? We are only God's servants through whom you believed the Good News. Each of us did the work the Lord gave us.
461Co 3:6 I planted the seed in your hearts, and Apollos watered it, but it was God who made it grow.
461Co 3:7 It's not important who does the planting, or who does the watering. What's important is that God makes the seed grow.
461Co 3:8 The one who plants and the one who waters work together with the same purpose. And both will be rewarded for their own hard work.
461Co 3:9 For we are both God's workers. And you are God's field. You are God's building.
461Co 3:10 Because of God's grace to me, I have laid the foundation like an expert builder. Now others are building on it. But whoever is building on this foundation must be very careful.
461Co 3:11 For no one can lay any foundation other than the one we already have?Jesus Christ.
461Co 3:12 Anyone who builds on that foundation may use a variety of materials?gold, silver, jewels, wood, hay, or straw.
461Co 3:13 But on the judgment day, fire will reveal what kind of work each builder has done. The fire will show if a person's work has any value.
461Co 3:14 If the work survives, that builder will receive a reward.
461Co 3:15 But if the work is burned up, the builder will suffer great loss. The builder will be saved, but like someone barely escaping through a wall of flames.
461Co 3:16 Don't you realize that all of you together are the temple of God and that the Spirit of God lives in�� you? / ��Or among
461Co 3:17 God will destroy anyone who destroys this temple. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple.
461Co 3:18 Stop deceiving yourselves. If you think you are wise by this world's standards, you need to become a fool to be truly wise.
461Co 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is foolishness to God. As the Scriptures say, "He traps the wise in the snare of their own cleverness."�� / ��Job 5.13
461Co 3:20 And again, "The LORD knows the thoughts of the wise; he knows they are worthless."�� / ��Ps 94.11
461Co 3:21 So don't boast about following a particular human leader. For everything belongs to you?
461Co 3:22 whether Paul or Apollos or Peter��, or the world, or life and death, or the present and the future. Everything belongs to you, / ��Greek Cephas
461Co 3:23 and you belong to Christ, and Christ belongs to God.
461Co 4:1 So look at Apollos and me as mere servants of Christ who have been put in charge of explaining God's mysteries.
461Co 4:2 Now, a person who is put in charge as a manager must be faithful.
461Co 4:3 As for me, it matters very little how I might be evaluated by you or by any human authority. I don't even trust my own judgment on this point.
461Co 4:4 My conscience is clear, but that doesn't prove I'm right. It is the Lord himself who will examine me and decide.
461Co 4:5 So don't make judgments about anyone ahead of time?before the Lord returns. For he will bring our darkest secrets to light and will reveal our private motives. Then God will give to each one whatever praise is due.
461Co 4:6 Dear brothers and sisters��, I have used Apollos and myself to illustrate what I've been saying. If you pay attention to what I have quoted from the Scriptures��, you won't be proud of one of your leaders at the expense of another. / ��Greek Brothers ��Or If you learn not to go beyond "what is written"
461Co 4:7 For what gives you the right to make such a judgment? What do you have that God hasn't given you? And if everything you have is from God, why boast as though it were not a gift?
461Co 4:8 You think you already have everything you need. You think you are already rich. You have begun to reign in God's kingdom without us! I wish you really were reigning already, for then we would be reigning with you.
461Co 4:9 Instead, I sometimes think God has put us apostles on display, like prisoners of war at the end of a victor's parade, condemned to die. We have become a spectacle to the entire world?to people and angels alike.
461Co 4:10 Our dedication to Christ makes us look like fools, but you claim to be so wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are so powerful! You are honored, but we are ridiculed.
461Co 4:11 Even now we go hungry and thirsty, and we don't have enough clothes to keep warm. We are often beaten and have no home.
461Co 4:12 We work wearily with our own hands to earn our living. We bless those who curse us. We are patient with those who abuse us.
461Co 4:13 We appeal gently when evil things are said about us. Yet we are treated like the world's garbage, like everybody's trash?right up to the present moment.
461Co 4:14 I am not writing these things to shame you, but to warn you as my beloved children.
461Co 4:15 For even if you had ten thousand others to teach you about Christ, you have only one spiritual father. For I became your father in Christ Jesus when I preached the Good News to you.
461Co 4:16 So I urge you to imitate me.
461Co 4:17 That's why I have sent Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord. He will remind you of how I follow Christ Jesus, just as I teach in all the churches wherever I go.
461Co 4:18 Some of you have become arrogant, thinking I will not visit you again.
461Co 4:19 But I will come?and soon?if the Lord lets me, and then I'll find out whether these arrogant people just give pretentious speeches or whether they really have God's power.
461Co 4:20 For the Kingdom of God is not just a lot of talk; it is living by God's power.
461Co 4:21 Which do you choose? Should I come with a rod to punish you, or should I come with love and a gentle spirit?
461Co 5:1 I can hardly believe the report about the sexual immorality going on among you?something that even pagans don't do. I am told that a man in your church is living in sin with his stepmother��. / ��Greek his father's wife
461Co 5:2 You are so proud of yourselves, but you should be mourning in sorrow and shame. And you should remove this man from your fellowship.
461Co 5:3 Even though I am not with you in person, I am with you in the Spirit��. And as though I were there, I have already passed judgment on this man / ��Or in spirit
461Co 5:4 in the name of the Lord Jesus. You must call a meeting of the church��. I will be present with you in spirit, and so will the power of our Lord Jesus. / ��Or In the name of the Lord Jesus, you must call a meeting of the church
461Co 5:5 Then you must throw this man out and hand him over to Satan so that his sinful nature will be destroyed�� and he himself�� will be saved on the day the Lord�� returns. / ��Or so that his body will be destroyed; Greek reads for the destruction of the flesh ��Greek and the spirit ��Other manuscripts read the Lord Jesus; still others read our Lord Jesus Christ
461Co 5:6 Your boasting about this is terrible. Don't you realize that this sin is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough?
461Co 5:7 Get rid of the old "yeast" by removing this wicked person from among you. Then you will be like a fresh batch of dough made without yeast, which is what you really are. Christ, our Passover Lamb, has been sacrificed for us��. / ��Greek has been sacrificed
461Co 5:8 So let us celebrate the festival, not with the old bread�� of wickedness and evil, but with the new bread�� of sincerity and truth. / ��Greek not with old leaven ��Greek but with unleavened [bread]
461Co 5:9 When I wrote to you before, I told you not to associate with people who indulge in sexual sin.
461Co 5:10 But I wasn't talking about unbelievers who indulge in sexual sin, or are greedy, or cheat people, or worship idols. You would have to leave this world to avoid people like that.
461Co 5:11 I meant that you are not to associate with anyone who claims to be a believer�� yet indulges in sexual sin, or is greedy, or worships idols, or is abusive, or is a drunkard, or cheats people. Don't even eat with such people. / ��Greek a brother
461Co 5:12 It isn't my responsibility to judge outsiders, but it certainly is your responsibility to judge those inside the church who are sinning.
461Co 5:13 God will judge those on the outside; but as the Scriptures say, "You must remove the evil person from among you."�� / ��Deut 17.7
461Co 6:1 When one of you has a dispute with another believer, how dare you file a lawsuit and ask a secular court to decide the matter instead of taking it to other believers��! / ��Greek God's holy people; also in 6.2
461Co 6:2 Don't you realize that someday we believers will judge the world? And since you are going to judge the world, can't you decide even these little things among yourselves?
461Co 6:3 Don't you realize that we will judge angels? So you should surely be able to resolve ordinary disputes in this life.
461Co 6:4 If you have legal disputes about such matters, why go to outside judges who are not respected by the church?
461Co 6:5 I am saying this to shame you. Isn't there anyone in all the church who is wise enough to decide these issues?
461Co 6:6 But instead, one believer�� sues another - right in front of unbelievers! / ��Greek one brother
461Co 6:7 Even to have such lawsuits with one another is a defeat for you. Why not just accept the injustice and leave it at that? Why not let yourselves be cheated?
461Co 6:8 Instead, you yourselves are the ones who do wrong and cheat even your fellow believers��. / ��Greek even the brothers
461Co 6:9 Don't you realize that those who do wrong will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Don't fool yourselves. Those who indulge in sexual sin, or who worship idols, or commit adultery, or are male prostitutes, or practice homosexuality,
461Co 6:10 or are thieves, or greedy people, or drunkards, or are abusive, or cheat people?none of these will inherit the Kingdom of God.
461Co 6:11 Some of you were once like that. But you were cleansed; you were made holy; you were made right with God by calling on the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
461Co 6:12 You say, "I am allowed to do anything"?but not everything is good for you. And even though "I am allowed to do anything," I must not become a slave to anything.
461Co 6:13 You say, "Food was made for the stomach, and the stomach for food." (This is true, though someday God will do away with both of them.) But you can't say that our bodies were made for sexual immorality. They were made for the Lord, and the Lord cares about our bodies.
461Co 6:14 And God will raise us from the dead by his power, just as he raised our Lord from the dead.
461Co 6:15 Don't you realize that your bodies are actually parts of Christ? Should a man take his body, which is part of Christ, and join it to a prostitute? Never!
461Co 6:16 And don't you realize that if a man joins himself to a prostitute, he becomes one body with her? For the Scriptures say, "The two are united into one."�� / ��Gen 2.24
461Co 6:17 But the person who is joined to the Lord is one spirit with him.
461Co 6:18 Run from sexual sin! No other sin so clearly affects the body as this one does. For sexual immorality is a sin against your own body.
461Co 6:19 Don't you realize that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit, who lives in you and was given to you by God? You do not belong to yourself,
461Co 6:20 for God bought you with a high price. So you must honor God with your body.
461Co 7:1 Now regarding the questions you asked in your letter. Yes, it is good to live a celibate life��. / ��Greek It is good for a man not to touch a woman
461Co 7:2 But because there is so much sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife, and each woman should have her own husband.
461Co 7:3 The husband should fulfill his wife's sexual needs, and the wife should fulfill her husband's needs.
461Co 7:4 The wife gives authority over her body to her husband, and the husband gives authority over his body to his wife.
461Co 7:5 Do not deprive each other of sexual relations, unless you both agree to refrain from sexual intimacy for a limited time so you can give yourselves more completely to prayer. Afterward, you should come together again so that Satan won't be able to tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
461Co 7:6 I say this as a concession, not as a command.
461Co 7:7 But I wish everyone were single, just as I am. But God gives to some the gift of marriage, and to others the gift of singleness.
461Co 7:8 So I say to those who aren't married and to widows?it's better to stay unmarried, just as I am.
461Co 7:9 But if they can't control themselves, they should go ahead and marry. It's better to marry than to burn with lust.
461Co 7:10 But for those who are married, I have a command that comes not from me, but from the Lord��. A wife must not leave her husband. / ��See Matt 5.32; 19.9; Mark 10.11-12; Luke 16.18
461Co 7:11 But if she does leave him, let her remain single or else be reconciled to him. And the husband must not leave his wife.
461Co 7:12 Now, I will speak to the rest of you, though I do not have a direct command from the Lord. If a Christian man�� has a wife who is not a believer and she is willing to continue living with him, he must not leave her. / ��Greek a brother
461Co 7:13 And if a Christian woman has a husband who is not a believer and he is willing to continue living with her, she must not leave him.
461Co 7:14 For the Christian wife brings holiness to her marriage, and the Christian husband�� brings holiness to his marriage. Otherwise, your children would not be holy, but now they are holy. / ��Greek the brother
461Co 7:15 [But if the husband or wife who isn't a believer insists on leaving, let them go. In such cases the Christian husband or wife�� is no longer bound to the other, for God has called you�� to live in peace.] / ��Greek the brother or sister ��Some manuscripts read us
461Co 7:16 Don't you wives realize that your husbands might be saved because of you? And don't you husbands realize that your wives might be saved because of you?
461Co 7:17 Each of you should continue to live in whatever situation the Lord has placed you, and remain as you were when God first called you. This is my rule for all the churches.
461Co 7:18 For instance, a man who was circumcised before he became a believer should not try to reverse it. And the man who was uncircumcised when he became a believer should not be circumcised now.
461Co 7:19 For it makes no difference whether or not a man has been circumcised. The important thing is to keep God's commandments.
461Co 7:20 Yes, each of you should remain as you were when God called you.
461Co 7:21 Are you a slave? Don't let that worry you?but if you get a chance to be free, take it.
461Co 7:22 And remember, if you were a slave when the Lord called you, you are now free in the Lord. And if you were free when the Lord called you, you are now a slave of Christ.
461Co 7:23 God paid a high price for you, so don't be enslaved by the world��. / ��Greek don't become slaves of people
461Co 7:24 Each of you, dear brothers and sisters��, should remain as you were when God first called you. / ��Greek brothers; also in 7.29
461Co 7:25 Now regarding your question about the young women who are not yet married. I do not have a command from the Lord for them. But the Lord in his mercy has given me wisdom that can be trusted, and I will share it with you.
461Co 7:26 Because of the present crisis��, I think it is best to remain as you are. / ��Or the pressures of life
461Co 7:27 If you have a wife, do not seek to end the marriage. If you do not have a wife, do not seek to get married.
461Co 7:28 But if you do get married, it is not a sin. And if a young woman gets married, it is not a sin. However, those who get married at this time will have troubles, and I am trying to spare you those problems.
461Co 7:29 But let me say this, dear brothers and sisters�� The time that remains is very short. So from now on, those with wives should not focus only on their marriage.
461Co 7:30 Those who weep or who rejoice or who buy things should not be absorbed by their weeping or their joy or their possessions.
461Co 7:31 Those who use the things of the world should not become attached to them. For this world as we know it will soon pass away.
461Co 7:32 I want you to be free from the concerns of this life. An unmarried man can spend his time doing the Lord's work and thinking how to please him.
461Co 7:33 But a married man has to think about his earthly responsibilities and how to please his wife.
461Co 7:34 His interests are divided. In the same way, a woman who is no longer married or has never been married can be devoted to the Lord and holy in body and in spirit. But a married woman has to think about her earthly responsibilities and how to please her husband.
461Co 7:35 I am saying this for your benefit, not to place restrictions on you. I want you to do whatever will help you serve the Lord best, with as few distractions as possible.
461Co 7:36 But if a man thinks that he's treating his fiancee improperly and will inevitably give in to his passion, let him marry her as he wishes. It is not a sin.
461Co 7:37 But if he has decided firmly not to marry and there is no urgency and he can control his passion, he does well not to marry.
461Co 7:38 So the person who marries his fiancee does well, and the person who doesn't marry does even better.
461Co 7:39 A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. If her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, but only if he loves the Lord��. / ��Greek but only in the Lord
461Co 7:40 But in my opinion it would be better for her to stay single, and I think I am giving you counsel from God's Spirit when I say this.
461Co 8:1 Now regarding your question about food that has been offered to idols. Yes, we know that "we all have knowledge" about this issue. But while knowledge makes us feel important, it is love that strengthens the church.
461Co 8:2 Anyone who claims to know all the answers doesn't really know very much.
461Co 8:3 But the person who loves God is the one whom God recognizes��. / ��Some manuscripts read the person who loves has full knowledge
461Co 8:4 So, what about eating meat that has been offered to idols? Well, we all know that an idol is not really a god and that there is only one God.
461Co 8:5 There may be so-called gods both in heaven and on earth, and some people actually worship many gods and many lords.
461Co 8:6 But we know that there is only one God, the Father, who created everything, and we live for him. And there is only one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom God made everything and through whom we have been given life.
461Co 8:7 However, not all believers know this. Some are accustomed to thinking of idols as being real, so when they eat food that has been offered to idols, they think of it as the worship of real gods, and their weak consciences are violated.
461Co 8:8 It's true that we can't win God's approval by what we eat. We don't lose anything if we don't eat it, and we don't gain anything if we do.
461Co 8:9 But you must be careful so that your freedom does not cause others with a weaker conscience to stumble.
461Co 8:10 For if others see you?with your "superior knowledge"?eating in the temple of an idol, won't they be encouraged to violate their conscience by eating food that has been offered to an idol?
461Co 8:11 So because of your superior knowledge, a weak believer�� for whom Christ died will be destroyed. / ��Greek brother; also in 8.13
461Co 8:12 And when you sin against other believers�� by encouraging them to do something they believe is wrong, you are sinning against Christ. / ��Greek brothers
461Co 8:13 So if what I eat causes another believer to sin, I will never eat meat again as long as I live?for I don't want to cause another believer to stumble.
461Co 9:1 Am I not as free as anyone else? Am I not an apostle? Haven't I seen Jesus our Lord with my own eyes? Isn't it because of my work that you belong to the Lord?
461Co 9:2 Even if others think I am not an apostle, I certainly am to you. You yourselves are proof that I am the Lord's apostle.
461Co 9:3 This is my answer to those who question my authority��. / ��Greek those who examine me
461Co 9:4 Don't we have the right to live in your homes and share your meals?
461Co 9:5 Don't we have the right to bring a Christian wife with us as the other apostles and the Lord's brothers do, and as Peter�� does? / ��Greek Cephas
461Co 9:6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have to work to support ourselves?
461Co 9:7 What soldier has to pay his own expenses? What farmer plants a vineyard and doesn't have the right to eat some of its fruit? What shepherd cares for a flock of sheep and isn't allowed to drink some of the milk?
461Co 9:8 Am I expressing merely a human opinion, or does the law say the same thing?
461Co 9:9 For the law of Moses says, "You must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain."�� Was God thinking only about oxen when he said this? / ��Deut 25.4
461Co 9:10 Wasn't he actually speaking to us? Yes, it was written for us, so that the one who plows and the one who threshes the grain might both expect a share of the harvest.
461Co 9:11 Since we have planted spiritual seed among you, aren't we entitled to a harvest of physical food and drink?
461Co 9:12 If you support others who preach to you, shouldn't we have an even greater right to be supported? But we have never used this right. We would rather put up with anything than be an obstacle to the Good News about Christ.
461Co 9:13 Don't you realize that those who work in the temple get their meals from the offerings brought to the temple? And those who serve at the altar get a share of the sacrificial offerings.
461Co 9:14 In the same way, the Lord ordered that those who preach the Good News should be supported by those who benefit from it.
461Co 9:15 Yet I have never used any of these rights. And I am not writing this to suggest that I want to start now. In fact, I would rather die than lose my right to boast about preaching without charge.
461Co 9:16 Yet preaching the Good News is not something I can boast about. I am compelled by God to do it. How terrible for me if I didn't preach the Good News!
461Co 9:17 If I were doing this on my own initiative, I would deserve payment. But I have no choice, for God has given me this sacred trust.
461Co 9:18 What then is my pay? It is the opportunity to preach the Good News without charging anyone. That's why I never demand my rights when I preach the Good News.
461Co 9:19 Even though I am a free man with no master, I have become a slave to all people to bring many to Christ.
461Co 9:20 When I was with the Jews, I lived like a Jew to bring the Jews to Christ. When I was with those who follow the Jewish law, I too lived under that law. Even though I am not subject to the law, I did this so I could bring to Christ those who are under the law.
461Co 9:21 When I am with the Gentiles who do not follow the Jewish law��, I too live apart from that law so I can bring them to Christ. But I do not ignore the law of God; I obey the law of Christ. / ��Greek those without the law
461Co 9:22 When I am with those who are weak, I share their weakness, for I want to bring the weak to Christ. Yes, I try to find common ground with everyone, doing everything I can to save some.
461Co 9:23 I do everything to spread the Good News and share in its blessings.
461Co 9:24 Don't you realize that in a race everyone runs, but only one person gets the prize? So run to win!
461Co 9:25 All athletes are disciplined in their training. They do it to win a prize that will fade away, but we do it for an eternal prize.
461Co 9:26 So I run with purpose in every step. I am not just shadowboxing.
461Co 9:27 I discipline my body like an athlete, training it to do what it should. Otherwise, I fear that after preaching to others I myself might be disqualified.
461Co 10:1 I don't want you to forget, dear brothers and sisters��, about our ancestors in the wilderness long ago. All of them were guided by a cloud that moved ahead of them, and all of them walked through the sea on dry ground. / ��Greek brothers
461Co 10:2 In the cloud and in the sea, all of them were baptized as followers of Moses.
461Co 10:3 All of them ate the same spiritual food,
461Co 10:4 and all of them drank the same spiritual water. For they drank from the spiritual rock that traveled with them, and that rock was Christ.
461Co 10:5 Yet God was not pleased with most of them, and their bodies were scattered in the wilderness.
461Co 10:6 These things happened as a warning to us, so that we would not crave evil things as they did,
461Co 10:7 or worship idols as some of them did. As the Scriptures say, "The people celebrated with feasting and drinking, and they indulged in pagan revelry."�� / ��Exod 32.6
461Co 10:8 And we must not engage in sexual immorality as some of them did, causing 23,000 of them to die in one day.
461Co 10:9 Nor should we put Christ�� to the test, as some of them did and then died from snakebites. / ��Some manuscripts read the Lord
461Co 10:10 And don't grumble as some of them did, and then were destroyed by the angel of death.
461Co 10:11 These things happened to them as examples for us. They were written down to warn us who live at the end of the age.
461Co 10:12 If you think you are standing strong, be careful not to fall.
461Co 10:13 The temptations in your life are no different from what others experience. And God is faithful. He will not allow the temptation to be more than you can stand. When you are tempted, he will show you a way out so that you can endure.
461Co 10:14 So, my dear friends, flee from the worship of idols.
461Co 10:15 You are reasonable people. Decide for yourselves if what I am saying is true.
461Co 10:16 When we bless the cup at the Lord's Table, aren't we sharing in the blood of Christ? And when we break the bread, aren't we sharing in the body of Christ?
461Co 10:17 And though we are many, we all eat from one loaf of bread, showing that we are one body.
461Co 10:18 Think about the people of Israel. Weren't they united by eating the sacrifices at the altar?
461Co 10:19 What am I trying to say? Am I saying that food offered to idols has some significance, or that idols are real gods?
461Co 10:20 No, not at all. I am saying that these sacrifices are offered to demons, not to God. And I don't want you to participate with demons.
461Co 10:21 You cannot drink from the cup of the Lord and from the cup of demons, too. You cannot eat at the Lord's Table and at the table of demons, too.
461Co 10:22 What? Do we dare to rouse the Lord's jealousy? Do you think we are stronger than he is?
461Co 10:23 You say, "I am allowed to do anything"�� - but not everything is good for you. You say, "I am allowed to do anything"?but not everything is beneficial. / ��Greek All things are lawful; also in 10.23b
461Co 10:24 Don't be concerned for your own good but for the good of others.
461Co 10:25 So you may eat any meat that is sold in the marketplace without raising questions of conscience.
461Co 10:26 For "the earth is the LORD's, and everything in it."�� / ��Ps 24.1
461Co 10:27 If someone who isn't a believer asks you home for dinner, accept the invitation if you want to. Eat whatever is offered to you without raising questions of conscience.
461Co 10:28 (But suppose someone tells you, "This meat was offered to an idol." Don't eat it, out of consideration for the conscience of the one who told you.
461Co 10:29 It might not be a matter of conscience for you, but it is for the other person.) For why should my freedom be limited by what someone else thinks?
461Co 10:30 If I can thank God for the food and enjoy it, why should I be condemned for eating it?
461Co 10:31 So whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.
461Co 10:32 Don't give offense to Jews or Gentiles�� or the church of God. / ��Greek or Greeks
461Co 10:33 I, too, try to please everyone in everything I do. I don't just do what is best for me; I do what is best for others so that many may be saved.
461Co 11:1 And you should imitate me, just as I imitate Christ.
461Co 11:2 I am so glad that you always keep me in your thoughts, and that you are following the teachings I passed on to you.
461Co 11:3 But there is one thing I want you to know�� The head of every man is Christ, the head of woman is man, and the head of Christ is God.�� / ��Or to know�� The source of every man is Christ, the source of woman is man, and the source of Christ is God. Or to know�� Every man is responsible to Christ, a woman is responsible to her husband, and Christ is responsible to God.
461Co 11:4 A man dishonors his head�� if he covers his head while praying or prophesying. / ��Or dishonors Christ
461Co 11:5 But a woman dishonors her head�� if she prays or prophesies without a covering on her head, for this is the same as shaving her head. / ��Or dishonors her husband
461Co 11:6 Yes, if she refuses to wear a head covering, she should cut off all her hair! But since it is shameful for a woman to have her hair cut or her head shaved, she should wear a covering��. / ��Or should have long hair
461Co 11:7 A man should not wear anything on his head when worshiping, for man is made in God's image and reflects God's glory. And woman reflects man's glory.
461Co 11:8 For the first man didn't come from woman, but the first woman came from man.
461Co 11:9 And man was not made for woman, but woman was made for man.
461Co 11:10 For this reason, and because the angels are watching, a woman should wear a covering on her head to show she is under authority��. / ��Greek should have an authority on her head
461Co 11:11 But among the Lord's people, women are not independent of men, and men are not independent of women.
461Co 11:12 For although the first woman came from man, every other man was born from a woman, and everything comes from God.
461Co 11:13 Judge for yourselves. Is it right for a woman to pray to God in public without covering her head?
461Co 11:14 Isn't it obvious that it's disgraceful for a man to have long hair?
461Co 11:15 And isn't long hair a woman's pride and joy? For it has been given to her as a covering.
461Co 11:16 But if anyone wants to argue about this, I simply say that we have no other custom than this, and neither do God's other churches.
461Co 11:17 But in the following instructions, I cannot praise you. For it sounds as if more harm than good is done when you meet together.
461Co 11:18 First, I hear that there are divisions among you when you meet as a church, and to some extent I believe it.
461Co 11:19 But, of course, there must be divisions among you so that you who have God's approval will be recognized!
461Co 11:20 When you meet together, you are not really interested in the Lord's Supper.
461Co 11:21 For some of you hurry to eat your own meal without sharing with others. As a result, some go hungry while others get drunk.
461Co 11:22 What? Don't you have your own homes for eating and drinking? Or do you really want to disgrace God's church and shame the poor? What am I supposed to say? Do you want me to praise you? Well, I certainly will not praise you for this!
461Co 11:23 For I pass on to you what I received from the Lord himself. On the night when he was betrayed, the Lord Jesus took some bread
461Co 11:24 and gave thanks to God for it. Then he broke it in pieces and said, "This is my body, which is given for you��. Do this to remember me." / ��Greek which is for you; other manuscripts read which is broken for you.
461Co 11:25 In the same way, he took the cup of wine after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant between God and his people?an agreement confirmed with my blood. Do this to remember me as often as you drink it."
461Co 11:26 For every time you eat this bread and drink this cup, you are announcing the Lord's death until he comes again.
461Co 11:27 So anyone who eats this bread or drinks this cup of the Lord unworthily is guilty of sinning against�� the body and blood of the Lord. / ��Or is responsible for
461Co 11:28 That is why you should examine yourself before eating the bread and drinking the cup.
461Co 11:29 For if you eat the bread or drink the cup without honoring the body of Christ��, you are eating and drinking God's judgment upon yourself. / ��Greek the body; other manuscripts read the Lord's body
461Co 11:30 That is why many of you are weak and sick and some have even died.
461Co 11:31 But if we would examine ourselves, we would not be judged by God in this way.
461Co 11:32 Yet when we are judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so that we will not be condemned along with the world.
461Co 11:33 So, my dear brothers and sisters��, when you gather for the Lord's Supper, wait for each other. / ��Greek brothers
461Co 11:34 If you are really hungry, eat at home so you won't bring judgment upon yourselves when you meet together. I'll give you instructions about the other matters after I arrive.
461Co 12:1 Now, dear brothers and sisters��, regarding your question about the special abilities the Spirit gives us. I don't want you to misunderstand this. / ��Greek brothers
461Co 12:2 You know that when you were still pagans, you were led astray and swept along in worshiping speechless idols.
461Co 12:3 So I want you to know that no one speaking by the Spirit of God will curse Jesus, and no one can say Jesus is Lord, except by the Holy Spirit.
461Co 12:4 There are different kinds of spiritual gifts, but the same Spirit is the source of them all.
461Co 12:5 There are different kinds of service, but we serve the same Lord.
461Co 12:6 God works in different ways, but it is the same God who does the work in all of us.
461Co 12:7 A spiritual gift is given to each of us so we can help each other.
461Co 12:8 To one person the Spirit gives the ability to give wise advice��; to another the same Spirit gives a message of special knowledge��. / ��Or gives a word of wisdom ��Or gives a word of knowledge
461Co 12:9 The same Spirit gives great faith to another, and to someone else the one Spirit gives the gift of healing.
461Co 12:10 He gives one person the power to perform miracles, and another the ability to prophesy. He gives someone else the ability to discern whether a message is from the Spirit of God or from another spirit. Still another person is given the ability to speak in unknown languages��, while another is given the ability to interpret what is being said. / ��Or in various tongues; also in 12.28, 30
461Co 12:11 It is the one and only Spirit who distributes all these gifts. He alone decides which gift each person should have.
461Co 12:12 The human body has many parts, but the many parts make up one whole body. So it is with the body of Christ.
461Co 12:13 Some of us are Jews, some are Gentiles��, some are slaves, and some are free. But we have all been baptized into one body by one Spirit, and we all share the same Spirit��. / ��Greek some are Greeks ��Greek we were all given one Spirit to drink
461Co 12:14 Yes, the body has many different parts, not just one part.
461Co 12:15 If the foot says, "I am not a part of the body because I am not a hand," that does not make it any less a part of the body.
461Co 12:16 And if the ear says, "I am not part of the body because I am not an eye," would that make it any less a part of the body?
461Co 12:17 If the whole body were an eye, how would you hear? Or if your whole body were an ear, how would you smell anything?
461Co 12:18 But our bodies have many parts, and God has put each part just where he wants it.
461Co 12:19 How strange a body would be if it had only one part!
461Co 12:20 Yes, there are many parts, but only one body.
461Co 12:21 The eye can never say to the hand, "I don't need you." The head can't say to the feet, "I don't need you."
461Co 12:22 In fact, some parts of the body that seem weakest and least important are actually the most necessary.
461Co 12:23 And the parts we regard as less honorable are those we clothe with the greatest care. So we carefully protect those parts that should not be seen,
461Co 12:24 while the more honorable parts do not require this special care. So God has put the body together such that extra honor and care are given to those parts that have less dignity.
461Co 12:25 This makes for harmony among the members, so that all the members care for each other.
461Co 12:26 If one part suffers, all the parts suffer with it, and if one part is honored, all the parts are glad.
461Co 12:27 All of you together are Christ's body, and each of you is a part of it.
461Co 12:28 Here are some of the parts God has appointed for the church�� first are apostles, second are prophets, third are teachers, then those who do miracles, those who have the gift of healing, those who can help others, those who have the gift of leadership, those who speak in unknown languages.
461Co 12:29 Are we all apostles? Are we all prophets? Are we all teachers? Do we all have the power to do miracles?
461Co 12:30 Do we all have the gift of healing? Do we all have the ability to speak in unknown languages? Do we all have the ability to interpret unknown languages? Of course not!
461Co 12:31 So you should earnestly desire the most helpful gifts. But now let me show you a way of life that is best of all.
461Co 13:1 If I could speak all the languages of earth and of angels, but didn't love others, I would only be a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
461Co 13:2 If I had the gift of prophecy, and if I understood all of God's secret plans and possessed all knowledge, and if I had such faith that I could move mountains, but didn't love others, I would be nothing.
461Co 13:3 If I gave everything I have to the poor and even sacrificed my body, I could boast about it��; but if I didn't love others, I would have gained nothing. / ��Some manuscripts read sacrificed my body to be burned
461Co 13:4 Love is patient and kind. Love is not jealous or boastful or proud
461Co 13:5 or rude. It does not demand its own way. It is not irritable, and it keeps no record of being wronged.
461Co 13:6 It does not rejoice about injustice but rejoices whenever the truth wins out.
461Co 13:7 Love never gives up, never loses faith, is always hopeful, and endures through every circumstance.
461Co 13:8 Prophecy and speaking in unknown languages�� and special knowledge will become useless. But love will last forever! / ��Or in tongues
461Co 13:9 Now our knowledge is partial and incomplete, and even the gift of prophecy reveals only part of the whole picture!
461Co 13:10 But when full understanding comes, these partial things will become useless.
461Co 13:11 When I was a child, I spoke and thought and reasoned as a child. But when I grew up, I put away childish things.
461Co 13:12 Now we see things imperfectly as in a cloudy mirror, but then we will see everything with perfect clarity��. All that I know now is partial and incomplete, but then I will know everything completely, just as God now knows me completely. / ��Greek see face to face
461Co 13:13 Three things will last forever?faith, hope, and love?and the greatest of these is love.
461Co 14:1 Let love be your highest goal! But you should also desire the special abilities the Spirit gives?especially the ability to prophesy.
461Co 14:2 For if you have the ability to speak in tongues��, you will be talking only to God, since people won't be able to understand you. You will be speaking by the power of the Spirit, but it will all be mysterious. / ��Or in unknown languages; also in 14.4, 5, 13, 14, 18, 22, 26, 27, 28, 39
461Co 14:3 But one who prophesies strengthens others, encourages them, and comforts them.
461Co 14:4 A person who speaks in tongues is strengthened personally, but one who speaks a word of prophecy strengthens the entire church.
461Co 14:5 I wish you could all speak in tongues, but even more I wish you could all prophesy. For prophecy is greater than speaking in tongues, unless someone interprets what you are saying so that the whole church will be strengthened.
461Co 14:6 Dear brothers and sisters��, if I should come to you speaking in an unknown language��, how would that help you? But if I bring you a revelation or some special knowledge or prophecy or teaching, that will be helpful. / ��Greek brothers; also in 14.20, 26, 39 ��Or in tongues; also in 14.19, 23
461Co 14:7 Even lifeless instruments like the flute or the harp must play the notes clearly, or no one will recognize the melody.
461Co 14:8 And if the bugler doesn't sound a clear call, how will the soldiers know they are being called to battle?
461Co 14:9 It's the same for you. If you speak to people in words they don't understand, how will they know what you are saying? You might as well be talking into empty space.
461Co 14:10 There are many different languages in the world, and every language has meaning.
461Co 14:11 But if I don't understand a language, I will be a foreigner to someone who speaks it, and the one who speaks it will be a foreigner to me.
461Co 14:12 And the same is true for you. Since you are so eager to have the special abilities the Spirit gives, seek those that will strengthen the whole church.
461Co 14:13 So anyone who speaks in tongues should pray also for the ability to interpret what has been said.
461Co 14:14 For if I pray in tongues, my spirit is praying, but I don't understand what I am saying.
461Co 14:15 Well then, what shall I do? I will pray in the spirit��, and I will also pray in words I understand. I will sing in the spirit, and I will also sing in words I understand. / ��Or in the Spirit; also in 14.15b, 16
461Co 14:16 For if you praise God only in the spirit, how can those who don't understand you praise God along with you? How can they join you in giving thanks when they don't understand what you are saying?
461Co 14:17 You will be giving thanks very well, but it won't strengthen the people who hear you.
461Co 14:18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than any of you.
461Co 14:19 But in a church meeting I would rather speak five understandable words to help others than ten thousand words in an unknown language.
461Co 14:20 Dear brothers and sisters, don't be childish in your understanding of these things. Be innocent as babies when it comes to evil, but be mature in understanding matters of this kind.
461Co 14:21 It is written in the Scriptures�磺 "I will speak to my own people through strange languages and through the lips of foreigners. But even then, they will not listen to me,"�� says the LORD. / ��Greek in the law ��Isa 28.11-12
461Co 14:22 So you see that speaking in tongues is a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers. Prophecy, however, is for the benefit of believers, not unbelievers.
461Co 14:23 Even so, if unbelievers or people who don't understand these things come into your church meeting and hear everyone speaking in an unknown language, they will think you are crazy.
461Co 14:24 But if all of you are prophesying, and unbelievers or people who don't understand these things come into your meeting, they will be convicted of sin and judged by what you say.
461Co 14:25 As they listen, their secret thoughts will be exposed, and they will fall to their knees and worship God, declaring, "God is truly here among you."
461Co 14:26 Well, my brothers and sisters, let's summarize. When you meet together, one will sing, another will teach, another will tell some special revelation God has given, one will speak in tongues, and another will interpret what is said. But everything that is done must strengthen all of you.
461Co 14:27 No more than two or three should speak in tongues. They must speak one at a time, and someone must interpret what they say.
461Co 14:28 But if no one is present who can interpret, they must be silent in your church meeting and speak in tongues to God privately.
461Co 14:29 Let two or three people prophesy, and let the others evaluate what is said.
461Co 14:30 But if someone is prophesying and another person receives a revelation from the Lord, the one who is speaking must stop.
461Co 14:31 In this way, all who prophesy will have a turn to speak, one after the other, so that everyone will learn and be encouraged.
461Co 14:32 Remember that people who prophesy are in control of their spirit and can take turns.
461Co 14:33 For God is not a God of disorder but of peace, as in all the meetings of God's holy people.�� / ��The phrase as in all the meetings of God's holy people could instead be joined to the beginning of 14.34
461Co 14:34 Women should be silent during the church meetings. It is not proper for them to speak. They should be submissive, just as the law says.
461Co 14:35 If they have any questions, they should ask their husbands at home, for it is improper for women to speak in church meetings.�� / ��Some manuscripts place verses 34-35 after 14.40
461Co 14:36 Or do you think God's word originated with you Corinthians? Are you the only ones to whom it was given?
461Co 14:37 If you claim to be a prophet or think you are spiritual, you should recognize that what I am saying is a command from the Lord himself.
461Co 14:38 But if you do not recognize this, you yourself will not be recognized.�� / ��Some manuscripts read If you are ignorant of this, stay in your ignorance
461Co 14:39 So, my dear brothers and sisters, be eager to prophesy, and don't forbid speaking in tongues.
461Co 14:40 But be sure that everything is done properly and in order.
461Co 15:1 Let me now remind you, dear brothers and sisters��, of the Good News I preached to you before. You welcomed it then, and you still stand firm in it. / ��Greek brothers; also in 15.31, 50, 58
461Co 15:2 It is this Good News that saves you if you continue to believe the message I told you - unless, of course, you believed something that was never true in the first place.�� / ��Or unless you never believed it in the first place
461Co 15:3 I passed on to you what was most important and what had also been passed on to me. Christ died for our sins, just as the Scriptures said.
461Co 15:4 He was buried, and he was raised from the dead on the third day, just as the Scriptures said.
461Co 15:5 He was seen by Peter�� and then by the Twelve. / ��Greek Cephas
461Co 15:6 After that, he was seen by more than 500 of his followers�� at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died. / ��Greek the brothers
461Co 15:7 Then he was seen by James and later by all the apostles.
461Co 15:8 Last of all, as though I had been born at the wrong time, I also saw him.
461Co 15:9 For I am the least of all the apostles. In fact, I'm not even worthy to be called an apostle after the way I persecuted God's church.
461Co 15:10 But whatever I am now, it is all because God poured out his special favor on me?and not without results. For I have worked harder than any of the other apostles; yet it was not I but God who was working through me by his grace.
461Co 15:11 So it makes no difference whether I preach or they preach, for we all preach the same message you have already believed.
461Co 15:12 But tell me this?since we preach that Christ rose from the dead, why are some of you saying there will be no resurrection of the dead?
461Co 15:13 For if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised either.
461Co 15:14 And if Christ has not been raised, then all our preaching is useless, and your faith is useless.
461Co 15:15 And we apostles would all be lying about God?for we have said that God raised Christ from the grave. But that can't be true if there is no resurrection of the dead.
461Co 15:16 And if there is no resurrection of the dead, then Christ has not been raised.
461Co 15:17 And if Christ has not been raised, then your faith is useless and you are still guilty of your sins.
461Co 15:18 In that case, all who have died believing in Christ are lost!
461Co 15:19 And if our hope in Christ is only for this life, we are more to be pitied than anyone in the world.
461Co 15:20 But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead. He is the first of a great harvest of all who have died.
461Co 15:21 So you see, just as death came into the world through a man, now the resurrection from the dead has begun through another man.
461Co 15:22 Just as everyone dies because we all belong to Adam, everyone who belongs to Christ will be given new life.
461Co 15:23 But there is an order to this resurrection�� Christ was raised as the first of the harvest; then all who belong to Christ will be raised when he comes back.
461Co 15:24 After that the end will come, when he will turn the Kingdom over to God the Father, having destroyed every ruler and authority and power.
461Co 15:25 For Christ must reign until he humbles all his enemies beneath his feet.
461Co 15:26 And the last enemy to be destroyed is death.
461Co 15:27 For the Scriptures say, "God has put all things under his authority."�� (Of course, when it says "all things are under his authority," that does not include God himself, who gave Christ his authority.) / ��Ps 8.6
461Co 15:28 Then, when all things are under his authority, the Son will put himself under God's authority, so that God, who gave his Son authority over all things, will be utterly supreme over everything everywhere.
461Co 15:29 If the dead will not be raised, what point is there in people being baptized for those who are dead? Why do it unless the dead will someday rise again?
461Co 15:30 And why should we ourselves risk our lives hour by hour?
461Co 15:31 For I swear, dear brothers and sisters, that I face death daily. This is as certain as my pride in what Christ Jesus our Lord has done in you.
461Co 15:32 And what value was there in fighting wild beasts - those people of Ephesus�� - if there will be no resurrection from the dead? And if there is no resurrection, "Let's feast and drink, for tomorrow we die!"�� / ��Greek fighting wild beasts in Ephesus ��Isa 22.13
461Co 15:33 Don't be fooled by those who say such things, for "bad company corrupts good character."
461Co 15:34 Think carefully about what is right, and stop sinning. For to your shame I say that some of you don't know God at all.
461Co 15:35 But someone may ask, "How will the dead be raised? What kind of bodies will they have?"
461Co 15:36 What a foolish question! When you put a seed into the ground, it doesn't grow into a plant unless it dies first.
461Co 15:37 And what you put in the ground is not the plant that will grow, but only a bare seed of wheat or whatever you are planting.
461Co 15:38 Then God gives it the new body he wants it to have. A different plant grows from each kind of seed.
461Co 15:39 Similarly there are different kinds of flesh?one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.
461Co 15:40 There are also bodies in the heavens and bodies on the earth. The glory of the heavenly bodies is different from the glory of the earthly bodies.
461Co 15:41 The sun has one kind of glory, while the moon and stars each have another kind. And even the stars differ from each other in their glory.
461Co 15:42 It is the same way with the resurrection of the dead. Our earthly bodies are planted in the ground when we die, but they will be raised to live forever.
461Co 15:43 Our bodies are buried in brokenness, but they will be raised in glory. They are buried in weakness, but they will be raised in strength.
461Co 15:44 They are buried as natural human bodies, but they will be raised as spiritual bodies. For just as there are natural bodies, there are also spiritual bodies.
461Co 15:45 The Scriptures tell us, "The first man, Adam, became a living person."�� But the last Adam?that is, Christ?is a life-giving Spirit. / ��Gen 2.7
461Co 15:46 What comes first is the natural body, then the spiritual body comes later.
461Co 15:47 Adam, the first man, was made from the dust of the earth, while Christ, the second man, came from heaven.
461Co 15:48 Earthly people are like the earthly man, and heavenly people are like the heavenly man.
461Co 15:49 Just as we are now like the earthly man, we will someday be like�� the heavenly man. / ��Some manuscripts read let us be like
461Co 15:50 What I am saying, dear brothers and sisters, is that our physical bodies cannot inherit the Kingdom of God. These dying bodies cannot inherit what will last forever.
461Co 15:51 But let me reveal to you a wonderful secret. We will not all die, but we will all be transformed!
461Co 15:52 It will happen in a moment, in the blink of an eye, when the last trumpet is blown. For when the trumpet sounds, those who have died will be raised to live forever. And we who are living will also be transformed.
461Co 15:53 For our dying bodies must be transformed into bodies that will never die; our mortal bodies must be transformed into immortal bodies.
461Co 15:54 Then, when our dying bodies have been transformed into bodies that will never die��, this Scripture will be fulfilled�� "Death is swallowed up in victory.�� / ��Some manuscripts add and our mortal bodies have been transformed into immortal bodies ��Isa 25.8
461Co 15:55 O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?��" / ��Hos 13.14 (Greek version)
461Co 15:56 For sin is the sting that results in death, and the law gives sin its power.
461Co 15:57 But thank God! He gives us victory over sin and death through our Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 15:58 So, my dear brothers and sisters, be strong and immovable. Always work enthusiastically for the Lord, for you know that nothing you do for the Lord is ever useless.
461Co 16:1 Now regarding your question about the money being collected for God's people in Jerusalem. You should follow the same procedure I gave to the churches in Galatia.
461Co 16:2 On the first day of each week, you should each put aside a portion of the money you have earned. Don't wait until I get there and then try to collect it all at once.
461Co 16:3 When I come, I will write letters of recommendation for the messengers you choose to deliver your gift to Jerusalem.
461Co 16:4 And if it seems appropriate for me to go along, they can travel with me.
461Co 16:5 I am coming to visit you after I have been to Macedonia��, for I am planning to travel through Macedonia. / ��Macedonia was in the northern region of Greece.
461Co 16:6 Perhaps I will stay awhile with you, possibly all winter, and then you can send me on my way to my next destination.
461Co 16:7 This time I don't want to make just a short visit and then go right on. I want to come and stay awhile, if the Lord will let me.
461Co 16:8 In the meantime, I will be staying here at Ephesus until the Festival of Pentecost.
461Co 16:9 There is a wide-open door for a great work here, although many oppose me.
461Co 16:10 When Timothy comes, don't intimidate him. He is doing the Lord's work, just as I am.
461Co 16:11 Don't let anyone treat him with contempt. Send him on his way with your blessing when he returns to me. I expect him to come with the other believers.�� / ��Greek with the brothers; also in 16.12
461Co 16:12 Now about our brother Apollos?I urged him to visit you with the other believers, but he was not willing to go right now. He will see you later when he has the opportunity.
461Co 16:13 Be on guard. Stand firm in the faith. Be courageous��. Be strong. / ��Greek Be men
461Co 16:14 And do everything with love.
461Co 16:15 You know that Stephanas and his household were the first of the harvest of believers in Greece��, and they are spending their lives in service to God's people. I urge you, dear brothers and sisters��, / ��Greek in Achaia, the southern region of the Greek peninsula ��Greek brothers; also in 16.20
461Co 16:16 to submit to them and others like them who serve with such devotion.
461Co 16:17 I am very glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus have come here. They have been providing the help you weren't here to give me.
461Co 16:18 They have been a wonderful encouragement to me, as they have been to you. You must show your appreciation to all who serve so well.
461Co 16:19 The churches here in the province of Asia�� send greetings in the Lord, as do Aquila and Priscilla�� and all the others who gather in their home for church meetings. / ��Asia was a Roman province in what is now western Turkey ��Greek Prisca
461Co 16:20 All the brothers and sisters here send greetings to you. Greet each other with Christian love��. / ��Greek with a sacred kiss
461Co 16:21 HERE IS MY GREETING IN MY OWN HANDWRITING - PAUL.
461Co 16:22 If anyone does not love the Lord, that person is cursed. Our Lord, come!�� / ��From Aramaic, Marana tha. Some manuscripts read Maran atha, "Our Lord has come."

472Co 1:1 This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy. I am writing to God��s church in Corinth and to all of his holy people throughout Greece.�� / ��Greek Achaia, the southern region of the Greek peninsula
472Co 1:2 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
472Co 1:3 All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. God is our merciful Father and the source of all comfort. 
472Co 1:4 He comforts us in all our troubles so that we can comfort others. When they are troubled, we will be able to give them the same comfort God has given us. 
472Co 1:5 For the more we suffer for Christ, the more God will shower us with his comfort through Christ. 
472Co 1:6 Even when we are weighed down with troubles, it is for your comfort and salvation! For when we ourselves are comforted, we will certainly comfort you. Then you can patiently endure the same things we suffer. 
472Co 1:7 We are confident that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in the comfort God gives us.
472Co 1:8 We think you ought to know, dear brothers and sisters��, about the trouble we went through in the province of Asia. We were crushed and overwhelmed beyond our ability to endure, and we thought we would never live through it. / ��Greek brothers
472Co 1:9 In fact, we expected to die. But as a result, we stopped relying on ourselves and learned to rely only on God, who raises the dead. 
472Co 1:10 And he did rescue us from mortal danger, and he will rescue us again. We have placed our confidence in him, and he will continue to rescue us. 
472Co 1:11 And you are helping us by praying for us. Then many people will give thanks because God has graciously answered so many prayers for our safety.
472Co 1:12 We can say with confidence and a clear conscience that we have lived with a God-given holiness�� and sincerity in all our dealings. We have depended on God��s grace, not on our own human wisdom. That is how we have conducted ourselves before the world, and especially toward you. / ��Some manuscripts read honesty
472Co 1:13 Our letters have been straightforward, and there is nothing written between the lines and nothing you can��t understand. I hope someday you will fully understand us, 
472Co 1:14 even if you don��t understand us now. Then on the day when the Lord Jesus�� returns, you will be proud of us in the same way we are proud of you. / ��Some manuscripts read our Lord Jesus
472Co 1:15 Since I was so sure of your understanding and trust, I wanted to give you a double blessing by visiting you twice?
472Co 1:16 first on my way to Macedonia and again when I returned from Macedonia.�� Then you could send me on my way to Judea. / ��Macedonia was in the northern region of Greece
472Co 1:17 You may be asking why I changed my plan. Do you think I make my plans carelessly? Do you think I am like people of the world who say ��Yes�� when they really mean ��No��? 
472Co 1:18 As surely as God is faithful, my word to you does not waver between ��Yes�� and ��No.�� 
472Co 1:19 For Jesus Christ, the Son of God, does not waver between ��Yes�� and ��No.�� He is the one whom Silas��, Timothy, and I preached to you, and as God��s ultimate ��Yes,�� he always does what he says. / ��Greek Silvanus
472Co 1:20 For all of God��s promises have been fulfilled in Christ with a resounding ��Yes!�� And through Christ, our ��Amen�� (which means ��Yes��) ascends to God for his glory.
472Co 1:21 It is God who enables us, along with you, to stand firm for Christ. He has commissioned us, 
472Co 1:22 and he has identified us as his own by placing the Holy Spirit in our hearts as the first installment that guarantees everything he has promised us.
472Co 1:23 Now I call upon God as my witness that I am telling the truth. The reason I didn��t return to Corinth was to spare you from a severe rebuke. 
472Co 1:24 But that does not mean we want to dominate you by telling you how to put your faith into practice. We want to work together with you so you will be full of joy, for it is by your own faith that you stand firm.
472Co 2:1 So I decided that I would not bring you grief with another painful visit. 
472Co 2:2 For if I cause you grief, who will make me glad? Certainly not someone I have grieved. 
472Co 2:3 That is why I wrote to you as I did, so that when I do come, I won��t be grieved by the very ones who ought to give me the greatest joy. Surely you all know that my joy comes from your being joyful. 
472Co 2:4 I wrote that letter in great anguish, with a troubled heart and many tears. I didn��t want to grieve you, but I wanted to let you know how much love I have for you.
472Co 2:5 I am not overstating it when I say that the man who caused all the trouble hurt all of you more than he hurt me. 
472Co 2:6 Most of you opposed him, and that was punishment enough. 
472Co 2:7 Now, however, it is time to forgive and comfort him. Otherwise he may be overcome by discouragement. 
472Co 2:8 So I urge you now to reaffirm your love for him.
472Co 2:9 I wrote to you as I did to test you and see if you would fully comply with my instructions. 
472Co 2:10 When you forgive this man, I forgive him, too. And when I forgive whatever needs to be forgiven, I do so with Christ��s authority for your benefit, 
472Co 2:11 so that Satan will not outsmart us. For we are familiar with his evil schemes.
472Co 2:12 When I came to the city of Troas to preach the Good News of Christ, the Lord opened a door of opportunity for me. 
472Co 2:13 But I had no peace of mind because my dear brother Titus hadn��t yet arrived with a report from you. So I said good-bye and went on to Macedonia to find him.
472Co 2:14 But thank God! He has made us his captives and continues to lead us along in Christ��s triumphal procession. Now he uses us to spread the knowledge of Christ everywhere, like a sweet perfume. 
472Co 2:15 Our lives are a Christ-like fragrance rising up to God. But this fragrance is perceived differently by those who are being saved and by those who are perishing. 
472Co 2:16 To those who are perishing, we are a dreadful smell of death and doom. But to those who are being saved, we are a life-giving perfume. And who is adequate for such a task as this?
472Co 2:17 You see, we are not like the many hucksters�� who preach for personal profit. We preach the word of God with sincerity and with Christ��s authority, knowing that God is watching us. / ��Some manuscripts read the rest of the hucksters
472Co 3:1 Are we beginning to praise ourselves again? Are we like others, who need to bring you letters of recommendation, or who ask you to write such letters on their behalf? Surely not! 
472Co 3:2 The only letter of recommendation we need is you yourselves. Your lives are a letter written in our�� hearts; everyone can read it and recognize our good work among you. / ��Some manuscripts read your
472Co 3:3 Clearly, you are a letter from Christ showing the result of our ministry among you. This ��letter�� is written not with pen and ink, but with the Spirit of the living God. It is carved not on tablets of stone, but on human hearts.
472Co 3:4 We are confident of all this because of our great trust in God through Christ. 
472Co 3:5 It is not that we think we are qualified to do anything on our own. Our qualification comes from God. 
472Co 3:6 He has enabled us to be ministers of his new covenant. This is a covenant not of written laws, but of the Spirit. The old written covenant ends in death; but under the new covenant, the Spirit gives life.
472Co 3:7 The old way��, with laws etched in stone, led to death, though it began with such glory that the people of Israel could not bear to look at Moses�� face. For his face shone with the glory of God, even though the brightness was already fading away. / ��Or ministry; also in 3.8, 9, 10, 11, 12
472Co 3:8 Shouldn��t we expect far greater glory under the new way, now that the Holy Spirit is giving life? 
472Co 3:9 If the old way, which brings condemnation, was glorious, how much more glorious is the new way, which makes us right with God! 
472Co 3:10 In fact, that first glory was not glorious at all compared with the overwhelming glory of the new way. 
472Co 3:11 So if the old way, which has been replaced, was glorious, how much more glorious is the new, which remains forever!
472Co 3:12 Since this new way gives us such confidence, we can be very bold. 
472Co 3:13 We are not like Moses, who put a veil over his face so the people of Israel would not see the glory, even though it was destined to fade away. 
472Co 3:14 But the people��s minds were hardened, and to this day whenever the old covenant is being read, the same veil covers their minds so they cannot understand the truth. And this veil can be removed only by believing in Christ. 
472Co 3:15 Yes, even today when they read Moses�� writings, their hearts are covered with that veil, and they do not understand.
472Co 3:16 But whenever someone turns to the Lord, the veil is taken away. 
472Co 3:17 For the Lord is the Spirit, and wherever the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom. 
472Co 3:18 So all of us who have had that veil removed can see and reflect the glory of the Lord. And the Lord-who is the Spirit-makes us more and more like him as we are changed into his glorious image.
472Co 4:1 Therefore, since God in his mercy has given us this new way��, we never give up. / ��Or ministry
472Co 4:2 We reject all shameful deeds and underhanded methods. We don��t try to trick anyone or distort the word of God. We tell the truth before God, and all who are honest know this.
472Co 4:3 If the Good News we preach is hidden behind a veil, it is hidden only from people who are perishing. 
472Co 4:4 Satan, who is the god of this world, has blinded the minds of those who don��t believe. They are unable to see the glorious light of the Good News. They don��t understand this message about the glory of Christ, who is the exact likeness of God.
472Co 4:5 You see, we don��t go around preaching about ourselves. We preach that Jesus Christ is Lord, and we ourselves are your servants for Jesus�� sake. 
472Co 4:6 For God, who said, ��Let there be light in the darkness,�� has made this light shine in our hearts so we could know the glory of God that is seen in the face of Jesus Christ.
472Co 4:7 We now have this light shining in our hearts, but we ourselves are like fragile clay jars containing this great treasure.�� This makes it clear that our great power is from God, not from ourselves. / ��Greek We now have this treasure in clay jars
472Co 4:8 We are pressed on every side by troubles, but we are not crushed. We are perplexed, but not driven to despair. 
472Co 4:9 We are hunted down, but never abandoned by God. We get knocked down, but we are not destroyed. 
472Co 4:10 Through suffering, our bodies continue to share in the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be seen in our bodies.
472Co 4:11 Yes, we live under constant danger of death because we serve Jesus, so that the life of Jesus will be evident in our dying bodies. 
472Co 4:12 So we live in the face of death, but this has resulted in eternal life for you.
472Co 4:13 But we continue to preach because we have the same kind of faith the psalmist had when he said, ��I believed in God, so I spoke.���� / ��Ps 116.10
472Co 4:14 We know that God, who raised the Lord Jesus��, will also raise us with Jesus and present us to himself together with you. / ��Some manuscripts read who raised Jesus
472Co 4:15 All of this is for your benefit. And as God��s grace reaches more and more people, there will be great thanksgiving, and God will receive more and more glory.
472Co 4:16 That is why we never give up. Though our bodies are dying, our spirits are�� being renewed every day. / ��Greek our inner being is
472Co 4:17 For our present troubles are small and won��t last very long. Yet they produce for us a glory that vastly outweighs them and will last forever! 
472Co 4:18 So we don��t look at the troubles we can see now; rather, we fix our gaze on things that cannot be seen. For the things we see now will soon be gone, but the things we cannot see will last forever.
472Co 5:1 For we know that when this earthly tent we live in is taken down (that is, when we die and leave this earthly body), we will have a house in heaven, an eternal body made for us by God himself and not by human hands. 
472Co 5:2 We grow weary in our present bodies, and we long to put on our heavenly bodies like new clothing. 
472Co 5:3 For we will put on heavenly bodies; we will not be spirits without bodies.�� / ��Greek we will not be naked
472Co 5:4 While we live in these earthly bodies, we groan and sigh, but it��s not that we want to die and get rid of these bodies that clothe us. Rather, we want to put on our new bodies so that these dying bodies will be swallowed up by life. 
472Co 5:5 God himself has prepared us for this, and as a guarantee he has given us his Holy Spirit.
472Co 5:6 So we are always confident, even though we know that as long as we live in these bodies we are not at home with the Lord. 
472Co 5:7 For we live by believing and not by seeing. 
472Co 5:8 Yes, we are fully confident, and we would rather be away from these earthly bodies, for then we will be at home with the Lord. 
472Co 5:9 So whether we are here in this body or away from this body, our goal is to please him. 
472Co 5:10 For we must all stand before Christ to be judged. We will each receive whatever we deserve for the good or evil we have done in this earthly body.
472Co 5:11 Because we understand our fearful responsibility to the Lord, we work hard to persuade others. God knows we are sincere, and I hope you know this, too. 
472Co 5:12 Are we commending ourselves to you again? No, we are giving you a reason to be proud of us��, so you can answer those who brag about having a spectacular ministry rather than having a sincere heart. / ��Some manuscripts read proud of yourselves
472Co 5:13 If it seems we are crazy, it is to bring glory to God. And if we are in our right minds, it is for your benefit. 
472Co 5:14 Either way, Christ��s love controls us��. Since we believe that Christ died for all, we also believe that we have all died to our old life.�� / ��Or urges us on ��Greek Since one died for all, then all died
472Co 5:15 He died for everyone so that those who receive his new life will no longer live for themselves. Instead, they will live for Christ, who died and was raised for them.
472Co 5:16 So we have stopped evaluating others from a human point of view. At one time we thought of Christ merely from a human point of view. How differently we know him now! 
472Co 5:17 This means that anyone who belongs to Christ has become a new person. The old life is gone; a new life has begun!
472Co 5:18 And all of this is a gift from God, who brought us back to himself through Christ. And God has given us this task of reconciling people to him. 
472Co 5:19 For God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, no longer counting people��s sins against them. And he gave us this wonderful message of reconciliation. 
472Co 5:20 So we are Christ��s ambassadors; God is making his appeal through us. We speak for Christ when we plead, ��Come back to God!�� 
472Co 5:21 For God made Christ, who never sinned, to be the offering for our sin��, so that we could be made right with God through Christ. / ��Or to become sin itself
472Co 6:1 As God��s partners��, we beg you not to accept this marvelous gift of God��s kindness and then ignore it. / ��Or As we work together
472Co 6:2 For God says, ��At just the right time, I heard you. On the day of salvation, I helped you.���� Indeed, the ��right time�� is now. Today is the day of salvation. / ��Isa 49.8 (Greek version)
472Co 6:3 We live in such a way that no one will stumble because of us, and no one will find fault with our ministry. 
472Co 6:4 In everything we do, we show that we are true ministers of God. We patiently endure troubles and hardships and calamities of every kind. 
472Co 6:5 We have been beaten, been put in prison, faced angry mobs, worked to exhaustion, endured sleepless nights, and gone without food. 
472Co 6:6 We prove ourselves by our purity, our understanding, our patience, our kindness, by the Holy Spirit within us��, and by our sincere love. / ��Or by our holiness of spirit
472Co 6:7 We faithfully preach the truth. God��s power is working in us. We use the weapons of righteousness in the right hand for attack and the left hand for defense. 
472Co 6:8 We serve God whether people honor us or despise us, whether they slander us or praise us. We are honest, but they call us impostors. 
472Co 6:9 We are ignored, even though we are well known. We live close to death, but we are still alive. We have been beaten, but we have not been killed. 
472Co 6:10 Our hearts ache, but we always have joy. We are poor, but we give spiritual riches to others. We own nothing, and yet we have everything.
472Co 6:11 Oh, dear Corinthian friends! We have spoken honestly with you, and our hearts are open to you. 
472Co 6:12 There is no lack of love on our part, but you have withheld your love from us. 
472Co 6:13 I am asking you to respond as if you were my own children. Open your hearts to us!
472Co 6:14 Don��t team up with those who are unbelievers. How can righteousness be a partner with wickedness? How can light live with darkness? 
472Co 6:15 What harmony can there be between Christ and the devil��? How can a believer be a partner with an unbeliever? / ��Greek Beliar; various other manuscripts render this proper name of the devil as Belian, Beliab, or Belial
472Co 6:16 And what union can there be between God��s temple and idols? For we are the temple of the living God. As God said�� ��I will live in them and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people.�� / ��Lev 26.12; Ezek 37.27
472Co 6:17 Therefore, come out from among unbelievers, and separate yourselves from them, says the Lord. Don��t touch their filthy things, and I will welcome you.�� / ��Isa 52.11; Ezek 20.34 (Greek version)
472Co 6:18 And I will be your Father, and you will be my sons and daughters, says the Lord Almighty.���� / ��2 Sam 7.14
472Co 7:1 Because we have these promises, dear friends, let us cleanse ourselves from everything that can defile our body or spirit. And let us work toward complete holiness because we fear God.
472Co 7:2 Please open your hearts to us. We have not done wrong to anyone, nor led anyone astray, nor taken advantage of anyone. 
472Co 7:3 I��m not saying this to condemn you. I said before that you are in our hearts, and we live or die together with you. 
472Co 7:4 I have the highest confidence in you, and I take great pride in you. You have greatly encouraged me and made me happy despite all our troubles.
472Co 7:5 When we arrived in Macedonia, there was no rest for us. We faced conflict from every direction, with battles on the outside and fear on the inside. 
472Co 7:6 But God, who encourages those who are discouraged, encouraged us by the arrival of Titus. 
472Co 7:7 His presence was a joy, but so was the news he brought of the encouragement he received from you. When he told us how much you long to see me, and how sorry you are for what happened, and how loyal you are to me, I was filled with joy!
472Co 7:8 I am not sorry that I sent that severe letter to you, though I was sorry at first, for I know it was painful to you for a little while. 
472Co 7:9 Now I am glad I sent it, not because it hurt you, but because the pain caused you to repent and change your ways. It was the kind of sorrow God wants his people to have, so you were not harmed by us in any way. 
472Co 7:10 For the kind of sorrow God wants us to experience leads us away from sin and results in salvation. There��s no regret for that kind of sorrow. But worldly sorrow, which lacks repentance, results in spiritual death.
472Co 7:11 Just see what this godly sorrow produced in you! Such earnestness, such concern to clear yourselves, such indignation, such alarm, such longing to see me, such zeal, and such a readiness to punish wrong. You showed that you have done everything necessary to make things right. 
472Co 7:12 My purpose, then, was not to write about who did the wrong or who was wronged. I wrote to you so that in the sight of God you could see for yourselves how loyal you are to us. 
472Co 7:13 We have been greatly encouraged by this. In addition to our own encouragement, we were especially delighted to see how happy Titus was about the way all of you welcomed him and set his mind�� at ease. / ��Greek his spirit
472Co 7:14 I had told him how proud I was of you?and you didn��t disappoint me. I have always told you the truth, and now my boasting to Titus has also proved true! 
472Co 7:15 Now he cares for you more than ever when he remembers the way all of you obeyed him and welcomed him with such fear and deep respect. 
472Co 7:16 I am very happy now because I have complete confidence in you.
472Co 8:1 Now I want you to know, dear brothers and sisters��, what God in his kindness has done through the churches in Macedonia. / ��Greek brothers
472Co 8:2 They are being tested by many troubles, and they are very poor. But they are also filled with abundant joy, which has overflowed in rich generosity.
472Co 8:3 For I can testify that they gave not only what they could afford, but far more. And they did it of their own free will. 
472Co 8:4 They begged us again and again for the privilege of sharing in the gift for the believers�� in Jerusalem. / ��Greek for God��s holy people
472Co 8:5 They even did more than we had hoped, for their first action was to give themselves to the Lord and to us, just as God wanted them to do.
472Co 8:6 So we have urged Titus, who encouraged your giving in the first place, to return to you and encourage you to finish this ministry of giving. 
472Co 8:7 Since you excel in so many ways-in your faith, your gifted speakers, your knowledge, your enthusiasm, and your love from us�� - I want you to excel also in this gracious act of giving. / ��Some manuscripts read your love for us
472Co 8:8 I am not commanding you to do this. But I am testing how genuine your love is by comparing it with the eagerness of the other churches.
472Co 8:9 You know the generous grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. Though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that by his poverty he could make you rich.
472Co 8:10 Here is my advice�� It would be good for you to finish what you started a year ago. Last year you were the first who wanted to give, and you were the first to begin doing it. 
472Co 8:11 Now you should finish what you started. Let the eagerness you showed in the beginning be matched now by your giving. Give in proportion to what you have. 
472Co 8:12 Whatever you give is acceptable if you give it eagerly. And give according to what you have, not what you don��t have. 
472Co 8:13 Of course, I don��t mean your giving should make life easy for others and hard for yourselves. I only mean that there should be some equality. 
472Co 8:14 Right now you have plenty and can help those who are in need. Later, they will have plenty and can share with you when you need it. In this way, things will be equal. 
472Co 8:15 As the Scriptures say, ��Those who gathered a lot had nothing left over, and those who gathered only a little had enough.���� / ��Exod 16.18
472Co 8:16 But thank God! He has given Titus the same enthusiasm for you that I have. 
472Co 8:17 Titus welcomed our request that he visit you again. In fact, he himself was very eager to go and see you. 
472Co 8:18 We are also sending another brother with Titus. All the churches praise him as a preacher of the Good News. 
472Co 8:19 He was appointed by the churches to accompany us as we take the offering to Jerusalem�� - a service that glorifies the Lord and shows our eagerness to help. / ��See 1 Cor 16.3-4
472Co 8:20 We are traveling together to guard against any criticism for the way we are handling this generous gift. 
472Co 8:21 We are careful to be honorable before the Lord, but we also want everyone else to see that we are honorable.
472Co 8:22 We are also sending with them another of our brothers who has proven himself many times and has shown on many occasions how eager he is. He is now even more enthusiastic because of his great confidence in you. 
472Co 8:23 If anyone asks about Titus, say that he is my partner who works with me to help you. And the brothers with him have been sent by the churches��, and they bring honor to Christ. / ��Greek are apostles of the churches
472Co 8:24 So show them your love, and prove to all the churches that our boasting about you is justified.
472Co 9:1 I really don��t need to write to you about this ministry of giving for the believers in Jerusalem.�� / ��Greek about the offering for God��s holy people
472Co 9:2 For I know how eager you are to help, and I have been boasting to the churches in Macedonia that you in Greece�� were ready to send an offering a year ago. In fact, it was your enthusiasm that stirred up many of the Macedonian believers to begin giving. / ��Greek in Achaia, the southern region of the Greek peninsula. Macedonia was in the northern region of Greece
472Co 9:3 But I am sending these brothers to be sure you really are ready, as I have been telling them, and that your money is all collected. I don��t want to be wrong in my boasting about you. 
472Co 9:4 We would be embarrassed?not to mention your own embarrassment?if some Macedonian believers came with me and found that you weren��t ready after all I had told them! 
472Co 9:5 So I thought I should send these brothers ahead of me to make sure the gift you promised is ready. But I want it to be a willing gift, not one given grudgingly.
472Co 9:6 Remember this?a farmer who plants only a few seeds will get a small crop. But the one who plants generously will get a generous crop. 
472Co 9:7 You must each decide in your heart how much to give. And don��t give reluctantly or in response to pressure. ��For God loves a person who gives cheerfully.���� / ��See footnote on Prov 22.8
472Co 9:8 And God will generously provide all you need. Then you will always have everything you need and plenty left over to share with others. 
472Co 9:9 As the Scriptures say, ��They share freely and give generously to the poor. Their good deeds will be remembered forever.���� / ��Ps 112.9
472Co 9:10 For God is the one who provides seed for the farmer and then bread to eat. In the same way, he will provide and increase your resources and then produce a great harvest of generosity�� in you. / ��Greek righteousness
472Co 9:11 Yes, you will be enriched in every way so that you can always be generous. And when we take your gifts to those who need them, they will thank God. 
472Co 9:12 So two good things will result from this ministry of giving - the needs of the believers in Jerusalem�� will be met, and they will joyfully express their thanks to God. / ��Greek of God��s holy people
472Co 9:13 As a result of your ministry, they will give glory to God. For your generosity to them and to all believers will prove that you are obedient to the Good News of Christ. 
472Co 9:14 And they will pray for you with deep affection because of the overflowing grace God has given to you. 
472Co 9:15 Thank God for this gift�� too wonderful for words! / ��Greek his gift
472Co 10:1 Now I, Paul, appeal to you with the gentleness and kindness of Christ?though I realize you think I am timid in person and bold only when I write from far away. 
472Co 10:2 Well, I am begging you now so that when I come I won��t have to be bold with those who think we act from human motives.
472Co 10:3 We are human, but we don��t wage war as humans do. 
472Co 10:4 ��We use God��s mighty weapons, not worldly weapons, to knock down the strongholds of human reasoning and to destroy false arguments. / ��English translations divide verses 4 and 5 in various ways
472Co 10:5 We destroy every proud obstacle that keeps people from knowing God. We capture their rebellious thoughts and teach them to obey Christ. 
472Co 10:6 And after you have become fully obedient, we will punish everyone who remains disobedient.
472Co 10:7 Look at the obvious facts��. Those who say they belong to Christ must recognize that we belong to Christ as much as they do. / ��Or You look at things only on the basis of appearance
472Co 10:8 I may seem to be boasting too much about the authority given to us by the Lord. But our authority builds you up; it doesn��t tear you down. So I will not be ashamed of using my authority.
472Co 10:9 I��m not trying to frighten you by my letters. 
472Co 10:10 For some say, ��Paul��s letters are demanding and forceful, but in person he is weak, and his speeches are worthless!�� 
472Co 10:11 Those people should realize that our actions when we arrive in person will be as forceful as what we say in our letters from far away.
472Co 10:12 Oh, don��t worry; we wouldn��t dare say that we are as wonderful as these other men who tell you how important they are! But they are only comparing themselves with each other, using themselves as the standard of measurement. How ignorant!
472Co 10:13 We will not boast about things done outside our area of authority. We will boast only about what has happened within the boundaries of the work God has given us, which includes our working with you. 
472Co 10:14 We are not reaching beyond these boundaries when we claim authority over you, as if we had never visited you. For we were the first to travel all the way to Corinth with the Good News of Christ.
472Co 10:15 Nor do we boast and claim credit for the work someone else has done. Instead, we hope that your faith will grow so that the boundaries of our work among you will be extended. 
472Co 10:16 Then we will be able to go and preach the Good News in other places far beyond you, where no one else is working. Then there will be no question of our boasting about work done in someone else��s territory. 
472Co 10:17 As the Scriptures say, ��If you want to boast, boast only about the Lord.���� / ��Jer 9.24
472Co 10:18 When people commend themselves, it doesn��t count for much. The important thing is for the Lord to commend them.
472Co 11:1 I hope you will put up with a little more of my foolishness. Please bear with me. 
472Co 11:2 For I am jealous for you with the jealousy of God himself. I promised you as a pure bride�� to one husband - Christ. / ��Greek a virgin
472Co 11:3 But I fear that somehow your pure and undivided devotion to Christ will be corrupted, just as Eve was deceived by the cunning ways of the serpent. 
472Co 11:4 You happily put up with whatever anyone tells you, even if they preach a different Jesus than the one we preach, or a different kind of Spirit than the one you received, or a different kind of gospel than the one you believed.
472Co 11:5 But I don��t consider myself inferior in any way to these ��super apostles�� who teach such things. 
472Co 11:6 I may be unskilled as a speaker, but I��m not lacking in knowledge. We have made this clear to you in every possible way.
472Co 11:7 Was I wrong when I humbled myself and honored you by preaching God��s Good News to you without expecting anything in return? 
472Co 11:8 I ��robbed�� other churches by accepting their contributions so I could serve you at no cost. 
472Co 11:9 And when I was with you and didn��t have enough to live on, I did not become a financial burden to anyone. For the brothers who came from Macedonia brought me all that I needed. I have never been a burden to you, and I never will be. 
472Co 11:10 As surely as the truth of Christ is in me, no one in all of Greece�� will ever stop me from boasting about this. / ��Greek Achaia, the southern region of the Greek peninsula
472Co 11:11 Why? Because I don��t love you? God knows that I do.
472Co 11:12 But I will continue doing what I have always done. This will undercut those who are looking for an opportunity to boast that their work is just like ours. 
472Co 11:13 These people are false apostles. They are deceitful workers who disguise themselves as apostles of Christ. 
472Co 11:14 But I am not surprised! Even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light. 
472Co 11:15 So it is no wonder that his servants also disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. In the end they will get the punishment their wicked deeds deserve.
472Co 11:16 Again I say, don��t think that I am a fool to talk like this. But even if you do, listen to me, as you would to a foolish person, while I also boast a little. 
472Co 11:17 Such boasting is not from the Lord, but I am acting like a fool. 
472Co 11:18 And since others boast about their human achievements, I will, too. 
472Co 11:19 After all, you think you are so wise, but you enjoy putting up with fools! 
472Co 11:20 You put up with it when someone enslaves you, takes everything you have, takes advantage of you, takes control of everything, and slaps you in the face. 
472Co 11:21 I��m ashamed to say that we��ve been too ��weak�� to do that! But whatever they dare to boast about?I��m talking like a fool again?I dare to boast about it, too. 
472Co 11:22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they descendants of Abraham? So am I. 
472Co 11:23 Are they servants of Christ? I know I sound like a madman, but I have served him far more! I have worked harder, been put in prison more often, been whipped times without number, and faced death again and again. 
472Co 11:24 Five different times the Jewish leaders gave me thirty-nine lashes. 
472Co 11:25 Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. Once I spent a whole night and a day adrift at sea. 
472Co 11:26 I have traveled on many long journeys. I have faced danger from rivers and from robbers. I have faced danger from my own people, the Jews, as well as from the Gentiles. I have faced danger in the cities, in the deserts, and on the seas. And I have faced danger from men who claim to be believers but are not.�� / ��Greek from false brothers
472Co 11:27 I have worked hard and long, enduring many sleepless nights. I have been hungry and thirsty and have often gone without food. I have shivered in the cold, without enough clothing to keep me warm.
472Co 11:28 Then, besides all this, I have the daily burden of my concern for all the churches. 
472Co 11:29 Who is weak without my feeling that weakness? Who is led astray, and I do not burn with anger?
472Co 11:30 If I must boast, I would rather boast about the things that show how weak I am. 
472Co 11:31 God, the Father of our Lord Jesus, who is worthy of eternal praise, knows I am not lying. 
472Co 11:32 When I was in Damascus, the governor under King Aretas kept guards at the city gates to catch me. 
472Co 11:33 I had to be lowered in a basket through a window in the city wall to escape from him.
472Co 12:1 This boasting will do no good, but I must go on. I will reluctantly tell about visions and revelations from the Lord. 
472Co 12:2 I�� was caught up to the third heaven fourteen years ago. Whether I was in my body or out of my body, I don��t know?only God knows. / ��Greek I know a man in Christ who
472Co 12:3 Yes, only God knows whether I was in my body or outside my body. But I do know 
472Co 12:4 that I was caught up�� to paradise and heard things so astounding that they cannot be expressed in words, things no human is allowed to tell. / ��Greek But I know such a man, 4that he was caught up
472Co 12:5 That experience is worth boasting about, but I��m not going to do it. I will boast only about my weaknesses. 
472Co 12:6 If I wanted to boast, I would be no fool in doing so, because I would be telling the truth. But I won��t do it, because I don��t want anyone to give me credit beyond what they can see in my life or hear in my message, 
472Co 12:7 even though I have received such wonderful revelations from God. So to keep me from becoming proud, I was given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger from Satan to torment me and keep me from becoming proud.
472Co 12:8 Three different times I begged the Lord to take it away. 
472Co 12:9 Each time he said, ��My grace is all you need. My power works best in weakness.�� So now I am glad to boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ can work through me. 
472Co 12:10 That��s why I take pleasure in my weaknesses, and in the insults, hardships, persecutions, and troubles that I suffer for Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
472Co 12:11 You have made me act like a fool - boasting like this��. You ought to be writing commendations for me, for I am not at all inferior to these ��super apostles,�� even though I am nothing at all. / ��Some manuscripts omit boasting like this
472Co 12:12 When I was with you, I certainly gave you proof that I am an apostle. For I patiently did many signs and wonders and miracles among you. 
472Co 12:13 The only thing I failed to do, which I do in the other churches, was to become a financial burden to you. Please forgive me for this wrong!
472Co 12:14 Now I am coming to you for the third time, and I will not be a burden to you. I don��t want what you have?I want you. After all, children don��t provide for their parents. Rather, parents provide for their children. 
472Co 12:15 I will gladly spend myself and all I have for you, even though it seems that the more I love you, the less you love me.
472Co 12:16 Some of you admit I was not a burden to you. But others still think I was sneaky and took advantage of you by trickery. 
472Co 12:17 But how? Did any of the men I sent to you take advantage of you? 
472Co 12:18 When I urged Titus to visit you and sent our other brother with him, did Titus take advantage of you? No! For we have the same spirit and walk in each other��s steps, doing things the same way.
472Co 12:19 Perhaps you think we��re saying these things just to defend ourselves. No, we tell you this as Christ��s servants, and with God as our witness. Everything we do, dear friends, is to strengthen you. 
472Co 12:20 For I am afraid that when I come I won��t like what I find, and you won��t like my response. I am afraid that I will find quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly behavior. 
472Co 12:21 Yes, I am afraid that when I come again, God will humble me in your presence. And I will be grieved because many of you have not given up your old sins. You have not repented of your impurity, sexual immorality, and eagerness for lustful pleasure.
472Co 13:1 This is the third time I am coming to visit you (and as the Scriptures say, ��The facts of every case must be established by the testimony of two or three witnesses.����) / ��Deut 19.15
472Co 13:2 I have already warned those who had been sinning when I was there on my second visit. Now I again warn them and all others, just as I did before, that next time I will not spare them.
472Co 13:3 I will give you all the proof you want that Christ speaks through me. Christ is not weak when he deals with you; he is powerful among you. 
472Co 13:4 Although he was crucified in weakness, he now lives by the power of God. We, too, are weak, just as Christ was, but when we deal with you we will be alive with him and will have God��s power.
472Co 13:5 Examine yourselves to see if your faith is genuine. Test yourselves. Surely you know that Jesus Christ is among you��; if not, you have failed the test of genuine faith. / ��Or in you
472Co 13:6 As you test yourselves, I hope you will recognize that we have not failed the test of apostolic authority.
472Co 13:7 We pray to God that you will not do what is wrong by refusing our correction. I hope we won��t need to demonstrate our authority when we arrive. Do the right thing before we come - even if that makes it look like we have failed to demonstrate our authority. 
472Co 13:8 For we cannot oppose the truth, but must always stand for the truth. 
472Co 13:9 We are glad to seem weak if it helps show that you are actually strong. We pray that you will become mature.
472Co 13:10 I am writing this to you before I come, hoping that I won��t need to deal severely with you when I do come. For I want to use the authority the Lord has given me to strengthen you, not to tear you down.
472Co 13:11 Dear brothers and sisters��, I close my letter with these last words�� Be joyful. Grow to maturity. Encourage each other. Live in harmony and peace. Then the God of love and peace will be with you. / ��Greek Brothers
472Co 13:12 Greet each other with Christian love��. / ��Greek with a sacred kiss
472Co 13:13 All of God��s people here send you their greetings.
472Co 13:14 �� May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. / ��Some English translations include verse 13 as part of verse 12, and then verse 14 becomes verse 13

48Gl 1:1 This letter is from Paul, an apostle. I was not appointed by any group of people or any human authority, but by Jesus Christ himself and by God the Father, who raised Jesus from the dead.
48Gl 1:2 All the brothers and sisters�� here join me in sending this letter to the churches of Galatia. / ��Greek brothers; also in 1.11
48Gl 1:3 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ�� give you grace and peace. / ��Some manuscripts read God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ
48Gl 1:4 Jesus gave his life for our sins, just as God our Father planned, in order to rescue us from this evil world in which we live. 
48Gl 1:5 All glory to God forever and ever! Amen.
48Gl 1:6 I am shocked that you are turning away so soon from God, who called you to himself through the loving mercy of Christ��. You are following a different way that pretends to be the Good News / ��Some manuscripts read through loving mercy
48Gl 1:7 but is not the Good News at all. You are being fooled by those who deliberately twist the truth concerning Christ.
48Gl 1:8 Let God��s curse fall on anyone, including us or even an angel from heaven, who preaches a different kind of Good News than the one we preached to you. 
48Gl 1:9 I say again what we have said before�� If anyone preaches any other Good News than the one you welcomed, let that person be cursed.
48Gl 1:10 Obviously, I��m not trying to win the approval of people, but of God. If pleasing people were my goal, I would not be Christ��s servant.
48Gl 1:11 Dear brothers and sisters, I want you to understand that the gospel message I preach is not based on mere human reasoning. 
48Gl 1:12 I received my message from no human source, and no one taught me. Instead, I received it by direct revelation from Jesus Christ��. / ��Or by the revelation of Jesus Christ
48Gl 1:13 You know what I was like when I followed the Jewish religion?how I violently persecuted God��s church. I did my best to destroy it. 
48Gl 1:14 I was far ahead of my fellow Jews in my zeal for the traditions of my ancestors.
48Gl 1:15 But even before I was born, God chose me and called me by his marvelous grace. Then it pleased him 
48Gl 1:16 to reveal his Son to me�� so that I would proclaim the Good News about Jesus to the Gentiles. When this happened, I did not rush out to consult with any human being��. / ��Or in me ��Greek with flesh and blood
48Gl 1:17 Nor did I go up to Jerusalem to consult with those who were apostles before I was. Instead, I went away into Arabia, and later I returned to the city of Damascus.
48Gl 1:18 Then three years later I went to Jerusalem to get to know Peter��, and I stayed with him for fifteen days. / ��Greek Cephas
48Gl 1:19 The only other apostle I met at that time was James, the Lord��s brother. 
48Gl 1:20 I declare before God that what I am writing to you is not a lie.
48Gl 1:21 After that visit I went north into the provinces of Syria and Cilicia. 
48Gl 1:22 And still the Christians in the churches in Judea didn��t know me personally. 
48Gl 1:23 All they knew was that people were saying, ��The one who used to persecute us is now preaching the very faith he tried to destroy!�� 
48Gl 1:24 And they praised God because of me.
48Gl 2:1 Then fourteen years later I went back to Jerusalem again, this time with Barnabas; and Titus came along, too. 
48Gl 2:2 I went there because God revealed to me that I should go. While I was there I met privately with those considered to be leaders of the church and shared with them the message I had been preaching to the Gentiles. I wanted to make sure that we were in agreement, for fear that all my efforts had been wasted and I was running the race for nothing. 
48Gl 2:3 And they supported me and did not even demand that my companion Titus be circumcised, though he was a Gentile��. / ��Greek a Greek
48Gl 2:4 Even that question came up only because of some so-called Christians there - false ones, really�� - who were secretly brought in. They sneaked in to spy on us and take away the freedom we have in Christ Jesus. They wanted to enslave us and force us to follow their Jewish regulations. / ��Greek some false brothers
48Gl 2:5 But we refused to give in to them for a single moment. We wanted to preserve the truth of the gospel message for you.
48Gl 2:6 And the leaders of the church had nothing to add to what I was preaching. (By the way, their reputation as great leaders made no difference to me, for God has no favorites.) 
48Gl 2:7 Instead, they saw that God had given me the responsibility of preaching the gospel to the Gentiles, just as he had given Peter the responsibility of preaching to the Jews. 
48Gl 2:8 For the same God who worked through Peter as the apostle to the Jews also worked through me as the apostle to the Gentiles.
48Gl 2:9 In fact, James, Peter��, and John, who were known as pillars of the church, recognized the gift God had given me, and they accepted Barnabas and me as their co-workers. They encouraged us to keep preaching to the Gentiles, while they continued their work with the Jews. / ��Greek Cephas; also in 2.11, 14
48Gl 2:10 Their only suggestion was that we keep on helping the poor, which I have always been eager to do.
48Gl 2:11 But when Peter came to Antioch, I had to oppose him to his face, for what he did was very wrong. 
48Gl 2:12 When he first arrived, he ate with the Gentile Christians, who were not circumcised. But afterward, when some friends of James came, Peter wouldn��t eat with the Gentiles anymore. He was afraid of criticism from these people who insisted on the necessity of circumcision. 
48Gl 2:13 As a result, other Jewish Christians followed Peter��s hypocrisy, and even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
48Gl 2:14 When I saw that they were not following the truth of the gospel message, I said to Peter in front of all the others, ��Since you, a Jew by birth, have discarded the Jewish laws and are living like a Gentile, why are you now trying to make these Gentiles follow the Jewish traditions?
48Gl 2:15 ��You and I are Jews by birth, not ��sinners�� like the Gentiles. 
48Gl 2:16 Yet we know that a person is made right with God by faith in Jesus Christ, not by obeying the law. And we have believed in Christ Jesus, so that we might be made right with God because of our faith in Christ, not because we have obeyed the law. For no one will ever be made right with God by obeying the law.���� / ��Some translators hold that the quotation extends through verse 14; others through verse 16; and still others through verse 21
48Gl 2:17 But suppose we seek to be made right with God through faith in Christ and then we are found guilty because we have abandoned the law. Would that mean Christ has led us into sin? Absolutely not! 
48Gl 2:18 Rather, I am a sinner if I rebuild the old system of law I already tore down. 
48Gl 2:19 For when I tried to keep the law, it condemned me. So I died to the law?I stopped trying to meet all its requirements?so that I might live for God. 
48Gl 2:20 My old self has been crucified with Christ.�� It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. So I live in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me. / ��Some English translations put this sentence in verse 19
48Gl 2:21 I do not treat the grace of God as meaningless. For if keeping the law could make us right with God, then there was no need for Christ to die.
48Gl 3:1 Oh, foolish Galatians! Who has cast an evil spell on you? For the meaning of Jesus Christ��s death was made as clear to you as if you had seen a picture of his death on the cross. 
48Gl 3:2 Let me ask you this one question�� Did you receive the Holy Spirit by obeying the law of Moses? Of course not! You received the Spirit because you believed the message you heard about Christ. 
48Gl 3:3 How foolish can you be? After starting your Christian lives in the Spirit, why are you now trying to become perfect by your own human effort? 
48Gl 3:4 Have you experienced�� so much for nothing? Surely it was not in vain, was it? / ��Or Have you suffered
48Gl 3:5 I ask you again, does God give you the Holy Spirit and work miracles among you because you obey the law? Of course not! It is because you believe the message you heard about Christ.
48Gl 3:6 In the same way, ��Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith.���� / ��Gen 15.6
48Gl 3:7 The real children of Abraham, then, are those who put their faith in God.
48Gl 3:8 What��s more, the Scriptures looked forward to this time when God would declare the Gentiles to be righteous because of their faith. God proclaimed this good news to Abraham long ago when he said, ��All nations will be blessed through you.���� / ��Gen 12.3; 18.18; 22.18
48Gl 3:9 So all who put their faith in Christ share the same blessing Abraham received because of his faith.
48Gl 3:10 But those who depend on the law to make them right with God are under his curse, for the Scriptures say, ��Cursed is everyone who does not observe and obey all the commands that are written in God��s Book of the Law.���� / ��Deut 27.26
48Gl 3:11 So it is clear that no one can be made right with God by trying to keep the law. For the Scriptures say, ��It is through faith that a righteous person has life.���� / ��Hab 2.4
48Gl 3:12 This way of faith is very different from the way of law, which says, ��It is through obeying the law that a person has life.���� / ��Lev 18.5
48Gl 3:13 But Christ has rescued us from the curse pronounced by the law. When he was hung on the cross, he took upon himself the curse for our wrongdoing. For it is written in the Scriptures, ��Cursed is everyone who is hung on a tree.���� / ��Deut 21.23 (Greek version)
48Gl 3:14 Through Christ Jesus, God has blessed the Gentiles with the same blessing he promised to Abraham, so that we who are believers might receive the promised�� Holy Spirit through faith. / ��Some manuscripts read the blessing of the
48Gl 3:15 Dear brothers and sisters��, here��s an example from everyday life. Just as no one can set aside or amend an irrevocable agreement, so it is in this case. / ��Greek Brothers
48Gl 3:16 God gave the promises to Abraham and his child��. And notice that the Scripture doesn��t say ��to his children��,�� as if it meant many descendants. Rather, it says ��to his child��?and that, of course, means Christ. / ��Greek seed; also in 3.16c, 19See notes on Gen 12.7 and 13.15 ��Greek seeds
48Gl 3:17 This is what I am trying to say�� The agreement God made with Abraham could not be canceled 430 years later when God gave the law to Moses. God would be breaking his promise. 
48Gl 3:18 For if the inheritance could be received by keeping the law, then it would not be the result of accepting God��s promise. But God graciously gave it to Abraham as a promise.
48Gl 3:19 Why, then, was the law given? It was given alongside the promise to show people their sins. But the law was designed to last only until the coming of the child who was promised. God gave his law through angels to Moses, who was the mediator between God and the people. 
48Gl 3:20 Now a mediator is helpful if more than one party must reach an agreement. But God, who is one, did not use a mediator when he gave his promise to Abraham.
48Gl 3:21 Is there a conflict, then, between God��s law and God��s promises��? Absolutely not! If the law could give us new life, we could be made right with God by obeying it. / ��Some manuscripts read and the promises
48Gl 3:22 But the Scriptures declare that we are all prisoners of sin, so we receive God��s promise of freedom only by believing in Jesus Christ.
48Gl 3:23 Before the way of faith in Christ was available to us, we were placed under guard by the law. We were kept in protective custody, so to speak, until the way of faith was revealed.
48Gl 3:24 Let me put it another way. The law was our guardian until Christ came; it protected us until we could be made right with God through faith. 
48Gl 3:25 And now that the way of faith has come, we no longer need the law as our guardian.
48Gl 3:26 For you are all children�� of God through faith in Christ Jesus. / ��Greek sons
48Gl 3:27 And all who have been united with Christ in baptism have put on Christ, like putting on new clothes��. / ��Greek have put on Christ
48Gl 3:28 There is no longer Jew or Gentile��, slave or free, male and female. For you are all one in Christ Jesus. / ��Greek Jew or Greek
48Gl 3:29 And now that you belong to Christ, you are the true children�� of Abraham. You are his heirs, and God��s promise to Abraham belongs to you. / ��Greek seed
48Gl 4:1 Think of it this way. If a father dies and leaves an inheritance for his young children, those children are not much better off than slaves until they grow up, even though they actually own everything their father had. 
48Gl 4:2 They have to obey their guardians until they reach whatever age their father set. 
48Gl 4:3 And that��s the way it was with us before Christ came. We were like children; we were slaves to the basic spiritual principles�� of this world. / ��Or powers; also in 4.9
48Gl 4:4 But when the right time came, God sent his Son, born of a woman, subject to the law. 
48Gl 4:5 God sent him to buy freedom for us who were slaves to the law, so that he could adopt us as his very own children��. / ��Greek sons; also in 4.6
48Gl 4:6 And because we�� are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, prompting us to call out, ��Abba, Father.���� / ��Greek you ��Abba is an Aramaic term for ��father.��
48Gl 4:7 Now you are no longer a slave but God��s own child��. And since you are his child, God has made you his heir. / ��Greek son; also in 4.7b
48Gl 4:8 Before you Gentiles knew God, you were slaves to so-called gods that do not even exist. 
48Gl 4:9 So now that you know God (or should I say, now that God knows you), why do you want to go back again and become slaves once more to the weak and useless spiritual principles of this world? 
48Gl 4:10 You are trying to earn favor with God by observing certain days or months or seasons or years. 
48Gl 4:11 I fear for you. Perhaps all my hard work with you was for nothing. 
48Gl 4:12 Dear brothers and sisters��, I plead with you to live as I do in freedom from these things, for I have become like you Gentiles - free from those laws. You did not mistreat me when I first preached to you. / ��Greek brothers; also in 4.28, 31
48Gl 4:13 Surely you remember that I was sick when I first brought you the Good News. 
48Gl 4:14 But even though my condition tempted you to reject me, you did not despise me or turn me away. No, you took me in and cared for me as though I were an angel from God or even Christ Jesus himself. 
48Gl 4:15 Where is that joyful and grateful spirit you felt then? I am sure you would have taken out your own eyes and given them to me if it had been possible. 
48Gl 4:16 Have I now become your enemy because I am telling you the truth?
48Gl 4:17 Those false teachers are so eager to win your favor, but their intentions are not good. They are trying to shut you off from me so that you will pay attention only to them. 
48Gl 4:18 If someone is eager to do good things for you, that��s all right; but let them do it all the time, not just when I��m with you.
48Gl 4:19 Oh, my dear children! I feel as if I��m going through labor pains for you again, and they will continue until Christ is fully developed in your lives. 
48Gl 4:20 I wish I were with you right now so I could change my tone. But at this distance I don��t know how else to help you.
48Gl 4:21 Tell me, you who want to live under the law, do you know what the law actually says? 
48Gl 4:22 The Scriptures say that Abraham had two sons, one from his slave wife and one from his freeborn wife.�� / ��See Gen 16.15; 21.2-3 
48Gl 4:23 The son of the slave wife was born in a human attempt to bring about the fulfillment of God��s promise. But the son of the freeborn wife was born as God��s own fulfillment of his promise.
48Gl 4:24 These two women serve as an illustration of God��s two covenants. The first woman, Hagar, represents Mount Sinai where people received the law that enslaved them. 
48Gl 4:25 And now Jerusalem is just like Mount Sinai in Arabia��, because she and her children live in slavery to the law. / ��Greek And Hagar, which is Mount Sinai in Arabia, is now like Jerusalem; other manuscripts read And Mount Sinai in Arabia is now like Jerusalem
48Gl 4:26 But the other woman, Sarah, represents the heavenly Jerusalem. She is the free woman, and she is our mother. 
48Gl 4:27 As Isaiah said, ��Rejoice, O childless woman, you who have never given birth! Break into a joyful shout, you who have never been in labor! For the desolate woman now has more children than the woman who lives with her husband!���� / ��Isa 54.1
48Gl 4:28 And you, dear brothers and sisters, are children of the promise, just like Isaac. 
48Gl 4:29 But you are now being persecuted by those who want you to keep the law, just as Ishmael, the child born by human effort, persecuted Isaac, the child born by the power of the Spirit.
48Gl 4:30 But what do the Scriptures say about that? ��Get rid of the slave and her son, for the son of the slave woman will not share the inheritance with the free woman��s son.���� / ��Gen 21.10 
48Gl 4:31 So, dear brothers and sisters, we are not children of the slave woman; we are children of the free woman.
48Gl 5:1 So Christ has truly set us free. Now make sure that you stay free, and don��t get tied up again in slavery to the law.
48Gl 5:2 Listen! I, Paul, tell you this�� If you are counting on circumcision to make you right with God, then Christ will be of no benefit to you. 
48Gl 5:3 I��ll say it again. If you are trying to find favor with God by being circumcised, you must obey every regulation in the whole law of Moses. 
48Gl 5:4 For if you are trying to make yourselves right with God by keeping the law, you have been cut off from Christ! You have fallen away from God��s grace.
48Gl 5:5 But we who live by the Spirit eagerly wait to receive by faith the righteousness God has promised to us. 
48Gl 5:6 For when we place our faith in Christ Jesus, there is no benefit in being circumcised or being uncircumcised. What is important is faith expressing itself in love.
48Gl 5:7 You were running the race so well. Who has held you back from following the truth? 
48Gl 5:8 It certainly isn��t God, for he is the one who called you to freedom. 
48Gl 5:9 This false teaching is like a little yeast that spreads through the whole batch of dough! 
48Gl 5:10 I am trusting the Lord to keep you from believing false teachings. God will judge that person, whoever he is, who has been confusing you.
48Gl 5:11 Dear brothers and sisters��, if I were still preaching that you must be circumcised - as some say I do - why am I still being persecuted? If I were no longer preaching salvation through the cross of Christ, no one would be offended. / ��Greek Brothers; similarly in 5.13
48Gl 5:12 I just wish that those troublemakers who want to mutilate you by circumcision would mutilate themselves.�� / ��Or castrate themselves, or cut themselves off from you; Greek reads cut themselves off
48Gl 5:13 For you have been called to live in freedom, my brothers and sisters. But don��t use your freedom to satisfy your sinful nature. Instead, use your freedom to serve one another in love. 
48Gl 5:14 For the whole law can be summed up in this one command�� ��Love your neighbor as yourself.���� / ��Lev 19.18 
48Gl 5:15 But if you are always biting and devouring one another, watch out! Beware of destroying one another.
48Gl 5:16 So I say, let the Holy Spirit guide your lives. Then you won��t be doing what your sinful nature craves. 
48Gl 5:17 The sinful nature wants to do evil, which is just the opposite of what the Spirit wants. And the Spirit gives us desires that are the opposite of what the sinful nature desires. These two forces are constantly fighting each other, so you are not free to carry out your good intentions. 
48Gl 5:18 But when you are directed by the Spirit, you are not under obligation to the law of Moses.
48Gl 5:19 When you follow the desires of your sinful nature, the results are very clear�� sexual immorality, impurity, lustful pleasures, 
48Gl 5:20 idolatry, sorcery, hostility, quarreling, jealousy, outbursts of anger, selfish ambition, dissension, division, 
48Gl 5:21 envy, drunkenness, wild parties, and other sins like these. Let me tell you again, as I have before, that anyone living that sort of life will not inherit the Kingdom of God.
48Gl 5:22 But the Holy Spirit produces this kind of fruit in our lives�� love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, 
48Gl 5:23 gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against these things!
48Gl 5:24 Those who belong to Christ Jesus have nailed the passions and desires of their sinful nature to his cross and crucified them there. 
48Gl 5:25 Since we are living by the Spirit, let us follow the Spirit��s leading in every part of our lives. 
48Gl 5:26 Let us not become conceited, or provoke one another, or be jealous of one another.
48Gl 6:1 Dear brothers and sisters, if another believer�� is overcome by some sin, you who are godly�� should gently and humbly help that person back onto the right path. And be careful not to fall into the same temptation yourself. / ��Greek Brothers, if a man ��Greek spiritual
48Gl 6:2 Share each other��s burdens, and in this way obey the law of Christ. 
48Gl 6:3 If you think you are too important to help someone, you are only fooling yourself. You are not that important.
48Gl 6:4 Pay careful attention to your own work, for then you will get the satisfaction of a job well done, and you won��t need to compare yourself to anyone else. 
48Gl 6:5 For we are each responsible for our own conduct.
48Gl 6:6 Those who are taught the word of God should provide for their teachers, sharing all good things with them.
48Gl 6:7 Don��t be misled?you cannot mock the justice of God. You will always harvest what you plant. 
48Gl 6:8 Those who live only to satisfy their own sinful nature will harvest decay and death from that sinful nature. But those who live to please the Spirit will harvest everlasting life from the Spirit. 
48Gl 6:9 So let��s not get tired of doing what is good. At just the right time we will reap a harvest of blessing if we don��t give up. 
48Gl 6:10 Therefore, whenever we have the opportunity, we should do good to everyone?especially to those in the family of faith.
48Gl 6:11 Notice what large letters I use as I write these closing words in my own handwriting.
48Gl 6:12 Those who are trying to force you to be circumcised want to look good to others. They don��t want to be persecuted for teaching that the cross of Christ alone can save. 
48Gl 6:13 And even those who advocate circumcision don��t keep the whole law themselves. They only want you to be circumcised so they can boast about it and claim you as their disciples.
48Gl 6:14 As for me, may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of that cross��, my interest in this world has been crucified, and the world��s interest in me has also died. / ��Or Because of him
48Gl 6:15 It doesn��t matter whether we have been circumcised or not. What counts is whether we have been transformed into a new creation. 
48Gl 6:16 May God��s peace and mercy be upon all who live by this principle; they are the new people of God.�� / ��Greek this principle, and upon the Israel of God
48Gl 6:17 From now on, don��t let anyone trouble me with these things. For I bear on my body the scars that show I belong to Jesus.
48Gl 6:18 Dear brothers and sisters��, may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen. / ��Greek Brothers

49Eph 1:1 This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. I am writing to God's holy people in Ephesus��, who are faithful followers of Christ Jesus. / ��The most ancient manuscripts do not include in Ephesus
49Eph 1:2 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
49Eph 1:3 All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ.
49Eph 1:4 Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes.
49Eph 1:5 God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure.
49Eph 1:6 So we praise God for the glorious grace he has poured out on us who belong to his dear Son.�� / ��Greek to us in the beloved
49Eph 1:7 He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son and forgave our sins.
49Eph 1:8 He has showered his kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding.
49Eph 1:9 God has now revealed to us his mysterious plan regarding Christ, a plan to fulfill his own good pleasure.
49Eph 1:10 And this is the plan�� At the right time he will bring everything together under the authority of Christ?everything in heaven and on earth.
49Eph 1:11 Furthermore, because we are united with Christ, we have received an inheritance from God��, for he chose us in advance, and he makes everything work out according to his plan. / ��Or we have become God's inheritance
49Eph 1:12 God's purpose was that we Jews who were the first to trust in Christ would bring praise and glory to God.
49Eph 1:13 And now you Gentiles have also heard the truth, the Good News that God saves you. And when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own�� by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago. / ��Or he put his seal on you
49Eph 1:14 The Spirit is God's guarantee that he will give us the inheritance he promised and that he has purchased us to be his own people. He did this so we would praise and glorify him.
49Eph 1:15 Ever since I first heard of your strong faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for God's people everywhere,�� / ��Some manuscripts read your faithfulness to the Lord Jesus and to God's people everywhere
49Eph 1:16 I have not stopped thanking God for you. I pray for you constantly,
49Eph 1:17 asking God, the glorious Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, to give you spiritual wisdom�� and insight so that you might grow in your knowledge of God. / ��Or to give you the Spirit of wisdom
49Eph 1:18 I pray that your hearts will be flooded with light so that you can understand the confident hope he has given to those he called?his holy people who are his rich and glorious inheritance.�� / ��Or called, and the rich and glorious inheritance he has given to his holy people
49Eph 1:19 I also pray that you will understand the incredible greatness of God's power for us who believe him. This is the same mighty power
49Eph 1:20 that raised Christ from the dead and seated him in the place of honor at God's right hand in the heavenly realms.
49Eph 1:21 Now he is far above any ruler or authority or power or leader or anything else?not only in this world but also in the world to come.
49Eph 1:22 God has put all things under the authority of Christ and has made him head over all things for the benefit of the church.
49Eph 1:23 And the church is his body; it is made full and complete by Christ, who fills all things everywhere with himself.
49Eph 2:1 Once you were dead because of your disobedience and your many sins.
49Eph 2:2 You used to live in sin, just like the rest of the world, obeying the devil - the commander of the powers in the unseen world.�� He is the spirit at work in the hearts of those who refuse to obey God. / ��Greek obeying the commander of the power of the air
49Eph 2:3 All of us used to live that way, following the passionate desires and inclinations of our sinful nature. By our very nature we were subject to God's anger, just like everyone else.
49Eph 2:4 But God is so rich in mercy, and he loved us so much,
49Eph 2:5 that even though we were dead because of our sins, he gave us life when he raised Christ from the dead. (It is only by God's grace that you have been saved!)
49Eph 2:6 For he raised us from the dead along with Christ and seated us with him in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ Jesus.
49Eph 2:7 So God can point to us in all future ages as examples of the incredible wealth of his grace and kindness toward us, as shown in all he has done for us who are united with Christ Jesus.
49Eph 2:8 God saved you by his grace when you believed. And you can't take credit for this; it is a gift from God.
49Eph 2:9 Salvation is not a reward for the good things we have done, so none of us can boast about it.
49Eph 2:10 For we are God's masterpiece. He has created us anew in Christ Jesus, so we can do the good things he planned for us long ago.
49Eph 2:11 Don't forget that you Gentiles used to be outsiders. You were called "uncircumcised heathens" by the Jews, who were proud of their circumcision, even though it affected only their bodies and not their hearts.
49Eph 2:12 In those days you were living apart from Christ. You were excluded from citizenship among the people of Israel, and you did not know the covenant promises God had made to them. You lived in this world without God and without hope.
49Eph 2:13 But now you have been united with Christ Jesus. Once you were far away from God, but now you have been brought near to him through the blood of Christ.
49Eph 2:14 For Christ himself has brought peace to us. He united Jews and Gentiles into one people when, in his own body on the cross, he broke down the wall of hostility that separated us.
49Eph 2:15 He did this by ending the system of law with its commandments and regulations. He made peace between Jews and Gentiles by creating in himself one new people from the two groups.
49Eph 2:16 Together as one body, Christ reconciled both groups to God by means of his death on the cross, and our hostility toward each other was put to death.
49Eph 2:17 He brought this Good News of peace to you Gentiles who were far away from him, and peace to the Jews who were near.
49Eph 2:18 Now all of us can come to the Father through the same Holy Spirit because of what Christ has done for us.
49Eph 2:19 So now you Gentiles are no longer strangers and foreigners. You are citizens along with all of God's holy people. You are members of God's family.
49Eph 2:20 Together, we are his house, built on the foundation of the apostles and the prophets. And the cornerstone is Christ Jesus himself.
49Eph 2:21 We are carefully joined together in him, becoming a holy temple for the Lord.
49Eph 2:22 Through him you Gentiles are also being made part of this dwelling where God lives by his Spirit.
49Eph 3:1 When I think of all this, I, Paul, a prisoner of Christ Jesus for the benefit of you Gentiles�� . . . / ��Paul resumes this thought in verse 14�� "When I think of all this, I fall to my knees and pray to the Father."
49Eph 3:2 assuming, by the way, that you know God gave me the special responsibility of extending his grace to you Gentiles.
49Eph 3:3 As I briefly wrote earlier, God himself revealed his mysterious plan to me.
49Eph 3:4 As you read what I have written, you will understand my insight into this plan regarding Christ.
49Eph 3:5 God did not reveal it to previous generations, but now by his Spirit he has revealed it to his holy apostles and prophets.
49Eph 3:6 And this is God's plan�� Both Gentiles and Jews who believe the Good News share equally in the riches inherited by God's children. Both are part of the same body, and both enjoy the promise of blessings because they belong to Christ Jesus.�� / ��Or because they are united with Christ Jesus
49Eph 3:7 By God's grace and mighty power, I have been given the privilege of serving him by spreading this Good News.
49Eph 3:8 Though I am the least deserving of all God's people, he graciously gave me the privilege of telling the Gentiles about the endless treasures available to them in Christ.
49Eph 3:9 I was chosen to explain to everyone�� this mysterious plan that God, the Creator of all things, had kept secret from the beginning. / ��Some manuscripts do not include to everyone
49Eph 3:10 God's purpose in all this was to use the church to display his wisdom in its rich variety to all the unseen rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.
49Eph 3:11 This was his eternal plan, which he carried out through Christ Jesus our Lord.
49Eph 3:12 Because of Christ and our faith in him��, we can now come boldly and confidently into God's presence. / ��Or Because of Christ's faithfulness
49Eph 3:13 So please don't lose heart because of my trials here. I am suffering for you, so you should feel honored.
49Eph 3:14 When I think of all this, I fall to my knees and pray to the Father��, / ��Some manuscripts read the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ
49Eph 3:15 the Creator of everything in heaven and on earth.�� / ��Or from whom every family in heaven and on earth takes its name
49Eph 3:16 I pray that from his glorious, unlimited resources he will empower you with inner strength through his Spirit.
49Eph 3:17 Then Christ will make his home in your hearts as you trust in him. Your roots will grow down into God's love and keep you strong.
49Eph 3:18 And may you have the power to understand, as all God's people should, how wide, how long, how high, and how deep his love is.
49Eph 3:19 May you experience the love of Christ, though it is too great to understand fully. Then you will be made complete with all the fullness of life and power that comes from God.
49Eph 3:20 Now all glory to God, who is able, through his mighty power at work within us, to accomplish infinitely more than we might ask or think.
49Eph 3:21 Glory to him in the church and in Christ Jesus through all generations forever and ever! Amen.
49Eph 4:1 Therefore I, a prisoner for serving the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of your calling, for you have been called by God.
49Eph 4:2 Always be humble and gentle. Be patient with each other, making allowance for each other's faults because of your love.
49Eph 4:3 Make every effort to keep yourselves united in the Spirit, binding yourselves together with peace.
49Eph 4:4 For there is one body and one Spirit, just as you have been called to one glorious hope for the future.
49Eph 4:5 There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
49Eph 4:6 and one God and Father, who is over all and in all and living through all.
49Eph 4:7 However, he has given each one of us a special gift�� through the generosity of Christ. / ��Greek a grace
49Eph 4:8 That is why the Scriptures say, "When he ascended to the heights, he led a crowd of captives and gave gifts to his people."�� / ��Ps 68.18
49Eph 4:9 Notice that it says "he ascended." This clearly means that Christ also descended to our lowly world.�� / ��Or to the lowest parts of the earth
49Eph 4:10 And the same one who descended is the one who ascended higher than all the heavens, so that he might fill the entire universe with himself.
49Eph 4:11 Now these are the gifts Christ gave to the church�� the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the pastors and teachers.
49Eph 4:12 Their responsibility is to equip God's people to do his work and build up the church, the body of Christ.
49Eph 4:13 This will continue until we all come to such unity in our faith and knowledge of God's Son that we will be mature in the Lord, measuring up to the full and complete standard of Christ.
49Eph 4:14 Then we will no longer be immature like children. We won't be tossed and blown about by every wind of new teaching. We will not be influenced when people try to trick us with lies so clever they sound like the truth.
49Eph 4:15 Instead, we will speak the truth in love, growing in every way more and more like Christ, who is the head of his body, the church.
49Eph 4:16 He makes the whole body fit together perfectly. As each part does its own special work, it helps the other parts grow, so that the whole body is healthy and growing and full of love.
49Eph 4:17 With the Lord's authority I say this�� Live no longer as the Gentiles do, for they are hopelessly confused.
49Eph 4:18 Their minds are full of darkness; they wander far from the life God gives because they have closed their minds and hardened their hearts against him.
49Eph 4:19 They have no sense of shame. They live for lustful pleasure and eagerly practice every kind of impurity.
49Eph 4:20 But that isn't what you learned about Christ.
49Eph 4:21 Since you have heard about Jesus and have learned the truth that comes from him,
49Eph 4:22 throw off your old sinful nature and your former way of life, which is corrupted by lust and deception.
49Eph 4:23 Instead, let the Spirit renew your thoughts and attitudes.
49Eph 4:24 Put on your new nature, created to be like God?truly righteous and holy.
49Eph 4:25 So stop telling lies. Let us tell our neighbors the truth, for we are all parts of the same body.
49Eph 4:26 And "don't sin by letting anger control you."�� Don't let the sun go down while you are still angry, / ��Ps 4.4
49Eph 4:27 for anger gives a foothold to the devil.
49Eph 4:28 If you are a thief, quit stealing. Instead, use your hands for good hard work, and then give generously to others in need.
49Eph 4:29 Don't use foul or abusive language. Let everything you say be good and helpful, so that your words will be an encouragement to those who hear them.
49Eph 4:30 And do not bring sorrow to God's Holy Spirit by the way you live. Remember, he has identified you as his own��, guaranteeing that you will be saved on the day of redemption. / ��Or has put his seal on you
49Eph 4:31 Get rid of all bitterness, rage, anger, harsh words, and slander, as well as all types of evil behavior.
49Eph 4:32 Instead, be kind to each other, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, just as God through Christ has forgiven you.
49Eph 5:1 Imitate God, therefore, in everything you do, because you are his dear children.
49Eph 5:2 Live a life filled with love, following the example of Christ. He loved us�� and offered himself as a sacrifice for us, a pleasing aroma to God. / ��Some manuscripts read loved you
49Eph 5:3 Let there be no sexual immorality, impurity, or greed among you. Such sins have no place among God's people.
49Eph 5:4 Obscene stories, foolish talk, and coarse jokes?these are not for you. Instead, let there be thankfulness to God.
49Eph 5:5 You can be sure that no immoral, impure, or greedy person will inherit the Kingdom of Christ and of God. For a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world.
49Eph 5:6 Don't be fooled by those who try to excuse these sins, for the anger of God will fall on all who disobey him.
49Eph 5:7 Don't participate in the things these people do.
49Eph 5:8 For once you were full of darkness, but now you have light from the Lord. So live as people of light!
49Eph 5:9 For this light within you produces only what is good and right and true.
49Eph 5:10 Carefully determine what pleases the Lord.
49Eph 5:11 Take no part in the worthless deeds of evil and darkness; instead, expose them.
49Eph 5:12 It is shameful even to talk about the things that ungodly people do in secret.
49Eph 5:13 But their evil intentions will be exposed when the light shines on them,
49Eph 5:14 for the light makes everything visible. This is why it is said, "Awake, O sleeper, rise up from the dead, and Christ will give you light."
49Eph 5:15 So be careful how you live. Don't live like fools, but like those who are wise.
49Eph 5:16 Make the most of every opportunity in these evil days.
49Eph 5:17 Don't act thoughtlessly, but understand what the Lord wants you to do.
49Eph 5:18 Don't be drunk with wine, because that will ruin your life. Instead, be filled with the Holy Spirit,
49Eph 5:19 singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs among yourselves, and making music to the Lord in your hearts.
49Eph 5:20 And give thanks for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
49Eph 5:21 And further, submit to one another out of reverence for Christ.
49Eph 5:22 For wives, this means submit to your husbands as to the Lord.
49Eph 5:23 For a husband is the head of his wife as Christ is the head of the church. He is the Savior of his body, the church.
49Eph 5:24 As the church submits to Christ, so you wives should submit to your husbands in everything.
49Eph 5:25 For husbands, this means love your wives, just as Christ loved the church. He gave up his life for her
49Eph 5:26 to make her holy and clean, washed by the cleansing of God's word.�� / ��Greek washed by water with the word
49Eph 5:27 He did this to present her to himself as a glorious church without a spot or wrinkle or any other blemish. Instead, she will be holy and without fault.
49Eph 5:28 In the same way, husbands ought to love their wives as they love their own bodies. For a man who loves his wife actually shows love for himself.
49Eph 5:29 No one hates his own body but feeds and cares for it, just as Christ cares for the church.
49Eph 5:30 And we are members of his body.
49Eph 5:31 As the Scriptures say, "A man leaves his father and mother and is joined to his wife, and the two are united into one."�� / ��Gen 2.24
49Eph 5:32 This is a great mystery, but it is an illustration of the way Christ and the church are one.
49Eph 5:33 So again I say, each man must love his wife as he loves himself, and the wife must respect her husband.
49Eph 6:1 Children, obey your parents because you belong to the Lord��, for this is the right thing to do. / ��Or Children, obey your parents who belong to the Lord; some manuscripts read simply Children, obey your parents
49Eph 6:2 "Honor your father and mother." This is the first commandment with a promise.
49Eph 6:3 If you honor your father and mother, "things will go well for you, and you will have a long life on the earth."�� / ��Exod 20.12; Deut 5.16
49Eph 6:4 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger by the way you treat them. Rather, bring them up with the discipline and instruction that comes from the Lord.
49Eph 6:5 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with deep respect and fear. Serve them sincerely as you would serve Christ.
49Eph 6:6 Try to please them all the time, not just when they are watching you. As slaves of Christ, do the will of God with all your heart.
49Eph 6:7 Work with enthusiasm, as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people.
49Eph 6:8 Remember that the Lord will reward each one of us for the good we do, whether we are slaves or free.
49Eph 6:9 Masters, treat your slaves in the same way. Don't threaten them; remember, you both have the same Master in heaven, and he has no favorites.
49Eph 6:10 A final word�� Be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power.
49Eph 6:11 Put on all of God's armor so that you will be able to stand firm against all strategies of the devil.
49Eph 6:12 For we�� are not fighting against flesh-and-blood enemies, but against evil rulers and authorities of the unseen world, against mighty powers in this dark world, and against evil spirits in the heavenly places. / ��Some manuscripts read you
49Eph 6:13 Therefore, put on every piece of God's armor so you will be able to resist the enemy in the time of evil. Then after the battle you will still be standing firm.
49Eph 6:14 Stand your ground, putting on the belt of truth and the body armor of God's righteousness.
49Eph 6:15 For shoes, put on the peace that comes from the Good News so that you will be fully prepared.�� / ��Or For shoes, put on the readiness to preach the Good News of peace with God

50Php 1:6 And I am certain that God, who began the good work within you, will continue his work until it is finally finished on the day when Christ Jesus returns.
50Php 1:7 So it is right that I should feel as I do about all of you, for you have a special place in my heart. You share with me the special favor of God, both in my imprisonment and in defending and confirming the truth of the Good News.
50Php 1:8 God knows how much I love you and long for you with the tender compassion of Christ Jesus.
50Php 1:9 I pray that your love will overflow more and more, and that you will keep on growing in knowledge and understanding.
50Php 1:10 For I want you to understand what really matters, so that you may live pure and blameless lives until the day of Christ's return.
50Php 1:11 May you always be filled with the fruit of your salvation - the righteous character produced in your life by Jesus Christ�� - for this will bring much glory and praise to God. / ��Greek with the fruit of righteousness through Jesus Christ
50Php 1:12 And I want you to know, my dear brothers and sisters��, that everything that has happened to me here has helped to spread the Good News. / ��Greek brothers
50Php 1:13 For everyone here, including the whole palace guard��, knows that I am in chains because of Christ. / ��Greek including all the Praetorium
50Php 1:14 And because of my imprisonment, most of the believers�� here have gained confidence and boldly speak God's message�� without fear. / ��Greek brothers in the Lord ��Some manuscripts read speak the message
50Php 1:15 It's true that some are preaching out of jealousy and rivalry. But others preach about Christ with pure motives.
50Php 1:16 They preach because they love me, for they know I have been appointed to defend the Good News.
50Php 1:17 Those others do not have pure motives as they preach about Christ. They preach with selfish ambition, not sincerely, intending to make my chains more painful to me.
50Php 1:18 But that doesn't matter. Whether their motives are false or genuine, the message about Christ is being preached either way, so I rejoice. And I will continue to rejoice.
50Php 1:19 For I know that as you pray for me and the Spirit of Jesus Christ helps me, this will lead to my deliverance.
50Php 1:20 For I fully expect and hope that I will never be ashamed, but that I will continue to be bold for Christ, as I have been in the past. And I trust that my life will bring honor to Christ, whether I live or die.
50Php 1:21 For to me, living means living for Christ, and dying is even better.
50Php 1:22 But if I live, I can do more fruitful work for Christ. So I really don't know which is better.
50Php 1:23 I'm torn between two desires�� I long to go and be with Christ, which would be far better for me.
50Php 1:24 But for your sakes, it is better that I continue to live.
50Php 1:25 Knowing this, I am convinced that I will remain alive so I can continue to help all of you grow and experience the joy of your faith.
50Php 1:26 And when I come to you again, you will have even more reason to take pride in Christ Jesus because of what he is doing through me.
50Php 1:27 Above all, you must live as citizens of heaven, conducting yourselves in a manner worthy of the Good News about Christ. Then, whether I come and see you again or only hear about you, I will know that you are standing together with one spirit and one purpose, fighting together for the faith, which is the Good News.
50Php 1:28 Don't be intimidated in any way by your enemies. This will be a sign to them that they are going to be destroyed, but that you are going to be saved, even by God himself.
50Php 1:29 For you have been given not only the privilege of trusting in Christ but also the privilege of suffering for him.
50Php 1:30 We are in this struggle together. You have seen my struggle in the past, and you know that I am still in the midst of it.
50Php 2:1 Is there any encouragement from belonging to Christ? Any comfort from his love? Any fellowship together in the Spirit? Are your hearts tender and compassionate?
50Php 2:2 Then make me truly happy by agreeing wholeheartedly with each other, loving one another, and working together with one mind and purpose.
50Php 2:3 Don't be selfish; don't try to impress others. Be humble, thinking of others as better than yourselves.
50Php 2:4 Don't look out only for your own interests, but take an interest in others, too.
50Php 2:5 You must have the same attitude that Christ Jesus had.
50Php 2:6 Though he was God��, he did not think of equality with God as something to cling to. / ��Or Being in the form of God
50Php 2:7 Instead, he gave up his divine privileges��; he took the humble position of a slave�� and was born as a human being. When he appeared in human form��, / ��Greek he emptied himself ��Or the form of a slave ��Some English translations put this phrase in verse 8
50Php 2:8 he humbled himself in obedience to God and died a criminal's death on a cross.
50Php 2:9 Therefore, God elevated him to the place of highest honor and gave him the name above all other names,
50Php 2:10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
50Php 2:11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
50Php 2:12 Dear friends, you always followed my instructions when I was with you. And now that I am away, it is even more important. Work hard to show the results of your salvation, obeying God with deep reverence and fear.
50Php 2:13 For God is working in you, giving you the desire and the power to do what pleases him.
50Php 2:14 Do everything without complaining and arguing,
50Php 2:15 so that no one can criticize you. Live clean, innocent lives as children of God, shining like bright lights in a world full of crooked and perverse people.
50Php 2:16 Hold firmly to the word of life; then, on the day of Christ's return, I will be proud that I did not run the race in vain and that my work was not useless.
50Php 2:17 But I will rejoice even if I lose my life, pouring it out like a liquid offering to God��, just like your faithful service is an offering to God. And I want all of you to share that joy. / ��Greek I will rejoice even if I am to be poured out as a liquid offering
50Php 2:18 Yes, you should rejoice, and I will share your joy.
50Php 2:19 If the Lord Jesus is willing, I hope to send Timothy to you soon for a visit. Then he can cheer me up by telling me how you are getting along.
50Php 2:20 I have no one else like Timothy, who genuinely cares about your welfare.
50Php 2:21 All the others care only for themselves and not for what matters to Jesus Christ.
50Php 2:22 But you know how Timothy has proved himself. Like a son with his father, he has served with me in preaching the Good News.
50Php 2:23 I hope to send him to you just as soon as I find out what is going to happen to me here.
50Php 2:24 And I have confidence from the Lord that I myself will come to see you soon.
50Php 2:25 Meanwhile, I thought I should send Epaphroditus back to you. He is a true brother, co-worker, and fellow soldier. And he was your messenger to help me in my need.
50Php 2:26 I am sending him because he has been longing to see you, and he was very distressed that you heard he was ill.
50Php 2:27 And he certainly was ill; in fact, he almost died. But God had mercy on him?and also on me, so that I would not have one sorrow after another.
50Php 2:28 So I am all the more anxious to send him back to you, for I know you will be glad to see him, and then I will not be so worried about you.
50Php 2:29 Welcome him with Christian love�� and with great joy, and give him the honor that people like him deserve. / ��Greek in the Lord
50Php 2:30 For he risked his life for the work of Christ, and he was at the point of death while doing for me what you couldn't do from far away.
50Php 3:1 Whatever happens, my dear brothers and sisters��, rejoice in the Lord. I never get tired of telling you these things, and I do it to safeguard your faith. / ��Greek brothers; also in 3.13, 17
50Php 3:2 Watch out for those dogs, those people who do evil, those mutilators who say you must be circumcised to be saved.
50Php 3:3 For we who worship by the Spirit of God�� are the ones who are truly circumcised. We rely on what Christ Jesus has done for us. We put no confidence in human effort, / ��Some manuscripts read worship God in spirit; one early manuscript reads worship in spirit
50Php 3:4 though I could have confidence in my own effort if anyone could. Indeed, if others have reason for confidence in their own efforts, I have even more!
50Php 3:5 I was circumcised when I was eight days old. I am a pure-blooded citizen of Israel and a member of the tribe of Benjamin?a real Hebrew if there ever was one! I was a member of the Pharisees, who demand the strictest obedience to the Jewish law.
50Php 3:6 I was so zealous that I harshly persecuted the church. And as for righteousness, I obeyed the law without fault.
50Php 3:7 I once thought these things were valuable, but now I consider them worthless because of what Christ has done.
50Php 3:8 Yes, everything else is worthless when compared with the infinite value of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have discarded everything else, counting it all as garbage, so that I could gain Christ
50Php 3:9 and become one with him. I no longer count on my own righteousness through obeying the law; rather, I become righteous through faith in Christ��. For God's way of making us right with himself depends on faith. / ��Or through the faithfulness of Christ
50Php 3:10 I want to know Christ and experience the mighty power that raised him from the dead. I want to suffer with him, sharing in his death,
50Php 3:11 so that one way or another I will experience the resurrection from the dead!
50Php 3:12 I don't mean to say that I have already achieved these things or that I have already reached perfection. But I press on to possess that perfection for which Christ Jesus first possessed me.
50Php 3:13 No, dear brothers and sisters, I have not achieved it��, but I focus on this one thing�� Forgetting the past and looking forward to what lies ahead, / ��Some manuscripts read not yet achieved it
50Php 3:14 I press on to reach the end of the race and receive the heavenly prize for which God, through Christ Jesus, is calling us.
50Php 3:15 Let all who are spiritually mature agree on these things. If you disagree on some point, I believe God will make it plain to you.
50Php 3:16 But we must hold on to the progress we have already made.
50Php 3:17 Dear brothers and sisters, pattern your lives after mine, and learn from those who follow our example.
50Php 3:18 For I have told you often before, and I say it again with tears in my eyes, that there are many whose conduct shows they are really enemies of the cross of Christ.
50Php 3:19 They are headed for destruction. Their god is their appetite, they brag about shameful things, and they think only about this life here on earth.
50Php 3:20 But we are citizens of heaven, where the Lord Jesus Christ lives. And we are eagerly waiting for him to return as our Savior.
50Php 3:21 He will take our weak mortal bodies and change them into glorious bodies like his own, using the same power with which he will bring everything under his control.
50Php 4:1 Therefore, my dear brothers and sisters��, stay true to the Lord. I love you and long to see you, dear friends, for you are my joy and the crown I receive for my work. / ��Greek brothers; also in 4.8
50Php 4:2 Now I appeal to Euodia and Syntyche. Please, because you belong to the Lord, settle your disagreement.
50Php 4:3 And I ask you, my true partner��, to help these two women, for they worked hard with me in telling others the Good News. They worked along with Clement and the rest of my co-workers, whose names are written in the Book of Life. / ��Or loyal Syzygus
50Php 4:4 Always be full of joy in the Lord. I say it again - rejoice!
50Php 4:5 Let everyone see that you are considerate in all you do. Remember, the Lord is coming soon.
50Php 4:6 Don't worry about anything; instead, pray about everything. Tell God what you need, and thank him for all he has done.
50Php 4:7 Then you will experience God's peace, which exceeds anything we can understand. His peace will guard your hearts and minds as you live in Christ Jesus.
50Php 4:8 And now, dear brothers and sisters, one final thing. Fix your thoughts on what is true, and honorable, and right, and pure, and lovely, and admirable. Think about things that are excellent and worthy of praise.
50Php 4:9 Keep putting into practice all you learned and received from me?everything you heard from me and saw me doing. Then the God of peace will be with you.
50Php 4:10 How I praise the Lord that you are concerned about me again. I know you have always been concerned for me, but you didn't have the chance to help me.
50Php 4:11 Not that I was ever in need, for I have learned how to be content with whatever I have.
50Php 4:12 I know how to live on almost nothing or with everything. I have learned the secret of living in every situation, whether it is with a full stomach or empty, with plenty or little.
50Php 4:13 For I can do everything through Christ��, who gives me strength. / ��Greek through the one
50Php 4:14 Even so, you have done well to share with me in my present difficulty.
50Php 4:15 As you know, you Philippians were the only ones who gave me financial help when I first brought you the Good News and then traveled on from Macedonia. No other church did this.
50Php 4:16 Even when I was in Thessalonica you sent help more than once.
50Php 4:17 I don't say this because I want a gift from you. Rather, I want you to receive a reward for your kindness.
50Php 4:18 At the moment I have all I need?and more! I am generously supplied with the gifts you sent me with Epaphroditus. They are a sweet-smelling sacrifice that is acceptable and pleasing to God.
50Php 4:19 And this same God who takes care of me will supply all your needs from his glorious riches, which have been given to us in Christ Jesus.
50Php 4:20 Now all glory to God our Father forever and ever! Amen.
50Php 4:21 Give my greetings to each of God's holy people?all who belong to Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me send you their greetings.
50Php 4:22 And all the rest of God's people send you greetings, too, especially those in Caesar's household.
50Php 4:23 May the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.

51Col 1:1 This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy.
51Col 1:2 We are writing to God's holy people in the city of Colosse, who are faithful brothers and sisters�� in Christ. May God our Father give you grace and peace. / ��Greek faithful brothers
51Col 1:3 We always pray for you, and we give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
51Col 1:4 For we have heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and your love for all of God's people,
51Col 1:5 which come from your confident hope of what God has reserved for you in heaven. You have had this expectation ever since you first heard the truth of the Good News.
51Col 1:6 This same Good News that came to you is going out all over the world. It is bearing fruit everywhere by changing lives, just as it changed your lives from the day you first heard and understood the truth about God's wonderful grace.
51Col 1:7 You learned about the Good News from Epaphras, our beloved co-worker. He is Christ's faithful servant, and he is helping us on your behalf.�� / ��Or he is ministering on your behalf; some manuscripts read he is ministering on our behalf
51Col 1:8 He has told us about the love for others that the Holy Spirit has given you.
51Col 1:9 So we have not stopped praying for you since we first heard about you. We ask God to give you complete knowledge of his will and to give you spiritual wisdom and understanding.
51Col 1:10 Then the way you live will always honor and please the Lord, and your lives will produce every kind of good fruit. All the while, you will grow as you learn to know God better and better.
51Col 1:11 We also pray that you will be strengthened with all his glorious power so you will have all the endurance and patience you need. May you be filled with joy��, / ��Or all the patience and endurance you need with joy
51Col 1:12 always thanking the Father. He has enabled you to share in the inheritance that belongs to his people, who live in the light.
51Col 1:13 For he has rescued us from the kingdom of darkness and transferred us into the Kingdom of his dear Son,
51Col 1:14 who purchased our freedom�� and forgave our sins. / ��Some manuscripts add with his blood
51Col 1:15 Christ is the visible image of the invisible God. He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation��, / ��Or He is the firstborn of all creation
51Col 1:16 for through him God created everything in the heavenly realms and on earth. He made the things we can see and the things we can't see?such as thrones, kingdoms, rulers, and authorities in the unseen world. Everything was created through him and for him.
51Col 1:17 He existed before anything else, and he holds all creation together.
51Col 1:18 Christ is also the head of the church, which is his body. He is the beginning, supreme over all who rise from the dead��. So he is first in everything. / ��Or the firstborn from the dead
51Col 1:19 For God in all his fullness was pleased to live in Christ,
51Col 1:20 and through him God reconciled everything to himself. He made peace with everything in heaven and on earth by means of Christ's blood on the cross.
51Col 1:21 This includes you who were once far away from God. You were his enemies, separated from him by your evil thoughts and actions.
51Col 1:22 Yet now he has reconciled you to himself through the death of Christ in his physical body. As a result, he has brought you into his own presence, and you are holy and blameless as you stand before him without a single fault.
51Col 1:23 But you must continue to believe this truth and stand firmly in it. Don't drift away from the assurance you received when you heard the Good News. The Good News has been preached all over the world, and I, Paul, have been appointed as God's servant to proclaim it.
51Col 1:24 I am glad when I suffer for you in my body, for I am participating in the sufferings of Christ that continue for his body, the church.
51Col 1:25 God has given me the responsibility of serving his church by proclaiming his entire message to you.
51Col 1:26 This message was kept secret for centuries and generations past, but now it has been revealed to God's people.
51Col 1:27 For God wanted them to know that the riches and glory of Christ are for you Gentiles, too. And this is the secret�� Christ lives in you. This gives you assurance of sharing his glory.
51Col 1:28 So we tell others about Christ, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all the wisdom God has given us. We want to present them to God, perfect�� in their relationship to Christ. / ��Or mature
51Col 1:29 That's why I work and struggle so hard, depending on Christ's mighty power that works within me.
51Col 2:1 I want you to know how much I have agonized for you and for the church at Laodicea, and for many other believers who have never met me personally.
51Col 2:2 I want them to be encouraged and knit together by strong ties of love. I want them to have complete confidence that they understand God's mysterious plan, which is Christ himself.
51Col 2:3 In him lie hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
51Col 2:4 I am telling you this so no one will deceive you with well-crafted arguments.
51Col 2:5 For though I am far away from you, my heart is with you. And I rejoice that you are living as you should and that your faith in Christ is strong.
51Col 2:6 And now, just as you accepted Christ Jesus as your Lord, you must continue to follow him.
51Col 2:7 Let your roots grow down into him, and let your lives be built on him. Then your faith will grow strong in the truth you were taught, and you will overflow with thankfulness.
51Col 2:8 Don't let anyone capture you with empty philosophies and high-sounding nonsense that come from human thinking and from the spiritual powers�� of this world, rather than from Christ. / ��Or the spiritual principles; also in 2.20
51Col 2:9 For in Christ lives all the fullness of God in a human body��. / ��Or in him dwells all the completeness of the Godhead bodily
51Col 2:10 So you also are complete through your union with Christ, who is the head over every ruler and authority.
51Col 2:11 When you came to Christ, you were "circumcised," but not by a physical procedure. Christ performed a spiritual circumcision?the cutting away of your sinful nature��. / ��Greek the cutting away of the body of the flesh
51Col 2:12 For you were buried with Christ when you were baptized. And with him you were raised to new life because you trusted the mighty power of God, who raised Christ from the dead.
51Col 2:13 You were dead because of your sins and because your sinful nature was not yet cut away. Then God made you alive with Christ, for he forgave all our sins.
51Col 2:14 He canceled the record of the charges against us and took it away by nailing it to the cross.
51Col 2:15 In this way, he disarmed�� the spiritual rulers and authorities. He shamed them publicly by his victory over them on the cross. / ��Or he stripped off
51Col 2:16 So don't let anyone condemn you for what you eat or drink, or for not celebrating certain holy days or new moon ceremonies or Sabbaths.
51Col 2:17 For these rules are only shadows of the reality yet to come. And Christ himself is that reality.
51Col 2:18 Don't let anyone condemn you by insisting on pious self-denial or the worship of angels��, saying they have had visions about these things. Their sinful minds have made them proud, / ��Or or worshiping with angels
51Col 2:19 and they are not connected to Christ, the head of the body. For he holds the whole body together with its joints and ligaments, and it grows as God nourishes it.
51Col 2:20 You have died with Christ, and he has set you free from the spiritual powers of this world. So why do you keep on following the rules of the world, such as,
51Col 2:21 "Don't handle! Don't taste! Don't touch!"?
51Col 2:22 Such rules are mere human teachings about things that deteriorate as we use them.
51Col 2:23 These rules may seem wise because they require strong devotion, pious self-denial, and severe bodily discipline. But they provide no help in conquering a person's evil desires.
51Col 3:1 Since you have been raised to new life with Christ, set your sights on the realities of heaven, where Christ sits in the place of honor at God's right hand.
51Col 3:2 Think about the things of heaven, not the things of earth.
51Col 3:3 For you died to this life, and your real life is hidden with Christ in God.
51Col 3:4 And when Christ, who is your�� life, is revealed to the whole world, you will share in all his glory. / ��Some manuscripts read our
51Col 3:5 So put to death the sinful, earthly things lurking within you. Have nothing to do with sexual immorality, impurity, lust, and evil desires. Don't be greedy, for a greedy person is an idolater, worshiping the things of this world.
51Col 3:6 Because of these sins, the anger of God is coming��. / ��Some manuscripts read is coming on all who disobey him
51Col 3:7 You used to do these things when your life was still part of this world.
51Col 3:8 But now is the time to get rid of anger, rage, malicious behavior, slander, and dirty language.
51Col 3:9 Don't lie to each other, for you have stripped off your old sinful nature and all its wicked deeds.
51Col 3:10 Put on your new nature, and be renewed as you learn to know your Creator and become like him.
51Col 3:11 In this new life, it doesn't matter if you are a Jew or a Gentile��, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbaric, uncivilized��, slave, or free. Christ is all that matters, and he lives in all of us. / ��Greek a Greek ��Greek Barbarian, Scythian
51Col 3:12 Since God chose you to be the holy people he loves, you must clothe yourselves with tenderhearted mercy, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience.
51Col 3:13 Make allowance for each other's faults, and forgive anyone who offends you. Remember, the Lord forgave you, so you must forgive others.
51Col 3:14 Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which binds us all together in perfect harmony.
51Col 3:15 And let the peace that comes from Christ rule in your hearts. For as members of one body you are called to live in peace. And always be thankful.
51Col 3:16 Let the message about Christ, in all its richness, fill your lives. Teach and counsel each other with all the wisdom he gives. Sing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs to God with thankful hearts.
51Col 3:17 And whatever you do or say, do it as a representative of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through him to God the Father.
51Col 3:18 Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting for those who belong to the Lord.
51Col 3:19 Husbands, love your wives and never treat them harshly.
51Col 3:20 Children, always obey your parents, for this pleases the Lord.
51Col 3:21 Fathers, do not aggravate your children, or they will become discouraged.
51Col 3:22 Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything you do. Try to please them all the time, not just when they are watching you. Serve them sincerely because of your reverent fear of the Lord.
51Col 3:23 Work willingly at whatever you do, as though you were working for the Lord rather than for people.
51Col 3:24 Remember that the Lord will give you an inheritance as your reward, and that the Master you are serving is Christ��. / ��Or and serve Christ as your Master
51Col 3:25 But if you do what is wrong, you will be paid back for the wrong you have done. For God has no favorites.
51Col 4:1 Masters, be just and fair to your slaves. Remember that you also have a Master?in heaven.
51Col 4:2 Devote yourselves to prayer with an alert mind and a thankful heart.
51Col 4:3 Pray for us, too, that God will give us many opportunities to speak about his mysterious plan concerning Christ. That is why I am here in chains.
51Col 4:4 Pray that I will proclaim this message as clearly as I should.
51Col 4:5 Live wisely among those who are not believers, and make the most of every opportunity.
51Col 4:6 Let your conversation be gracious and attractive�� so that you will have the right response for everyone. / ��Greek and seasoned with salt
51Col 4:7 Tychicus will give you a full report about how I am getting along. He is a beloved brother and faithful helper who serves with me in the Lord's work.
51Col 4:8 I have sent him to you for this very purpose?to let you know how we are doing and to encourage you.
51Col 4:9 I am also sending Onesimus, a faithful and beloved brother, one of your own people. He and Tychicus will tell you everything that's happening here.
51Col 4:10 Aristarchus, who is in prison with me, sends you his greetings, and so does Mark, Barnabas's cousin. As you were instructed before, make Mark welcome if he comes your way.
51Col 4:11 Jesus (the one we call Justus) also sends his greetings. These are the only Jewish believers among my co-workers; they are working with me here for the Kingdom of God. And what a comfort they have been!
51Col 4:12 Epaphras, a member of your own fellowship and a servant of Christ Jesus, sends you his greetings. He always prays earnestly for you, asking God to make you strong and perfect, fully confident that you are following the whole will of God.
51Col 4:13 I can assure you that he prays hard for you and also for the believers in Laodicea and Hierapolis.
51Col 4:14 Luke, the beloved doctor, sends his greetings, and so does Demas.
51Col 4:15 Please give my greetings to our brothers and sisters�� at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church that meets in her house. / ��Greek brothers
51Col 4:16 After you have read this letter, pass it on to the church at Laodicea so they can read it, too. And you should read the letter I wrote to them.

521Th 1:5 For when we brought you the Good News, it was not only with words but also with power, for the Holy Spirit gave you full assurance�� that what we said was true. And you know of our concern for you from the way we lived when we were with you. / ��Or with the power of the Holy Spirit, so you can have full assurance
521Th 1:6 So you received the message with joy from the Holy Spirit in spite of the severe suffering it brought you. In this way, you imitated both us and the Lord.
521Th 1:7 As a result, you have become an example to all the believers in Greece - throughout both Macedonia and Achaia��. / ��Macedonia and Achaia were the northern and southern regions of Greece
521Th 1:8 And now the word of the Lord is ringing out from you to people everywhere, even beyond Macedonia and Achaia, for wherever we go we find people telling us about your faith in God. We don't need to tell them about it,
521Th 1:9 for they keep talking about the wonderful welcome you gave us and how you turned away from idols to serve the living and true God.
521Th 1:10 And they speak of how you are looking forward to the coming of God's Son from heaven - Jesus, whom God raised from the dead. He is the one who has rescued us from the terrors of the coming judgment.
521Th 2:1 You yourselves know, dear brothers and sisters��, that our visit to you was not a failure. / ��Greek brothers; also in 2.9, 14, 17
521Th 2:2 You know how badly we had been treated at Philippi just before we came to you and how much we suffered there. Yet our God gave us the courage to declare his Good News to you boldly, in spite of great opposition.
521Th 2:3 So you can see we were not preaching with any deceit or impure motives or trickery.
521Th 2:4 For we speak as messengers approved by God to be entrusted with the Good News. Our purpose is to please God, not people. He alone examines the motives of our hearts.
521Th 2:5 Never once did we try to win you with flattery, as you well know. And God is our witness that we were not pretending to be your friends just to get your money!
521Th 2:6 As for human praise, we have never sought it from you or anyone else.
521Th 2:7 As apostles of Christ we certainly had a right to make some demands of you, but instead we were like children�� among you. Or we were like a mother feeding and caring for her own children. / ��Some manuscripts read we were gentle
521Th 2:8 We loved you so much that we shared with you not only God's Good News but our own lives, too.
521Th 2:9 Don't you remember, dear brothers and sisters, how hard we worked among you? Night and day we toiled to earn a living so that we would not be a burden to any of you as we preached God's Good News to you.
521Th 2:10 You yourselves are our witnesses - and so is God - that we were devout and honest and faultless toward all of you believers.
521Th 2:11 And you know that we treated each of you as a father treats his own children.
521Th 2:12 We pleaded with you, encouraged you, and urged you to live your lives in a way that God would consider worthy. For he called you to share in his Kingdom and glory.
521Th 2:13 Therefore, we never stop thanking God that when you received his message from us, you didn't think of our words as mere human ideas. You accepted what we said as the very word of God - which, of course, it is. And this word continues to work in you who believe.
521Th 2:14 And then, dear brothers and sisters, you suffered persecution from your own countrymen. In this way, you imitated the believers in God's churches in Judea who, because of their belief in Christ Jesus, suffered from their own people, the Jews.
521Th 2:15 For some of the Jews killed the prophets, and some even killed the Lord Jesus. Now they have persecuted us, too. They fail to please God and work against all humanity
521Th 2:16 as they try to keep us from preaching the Good News of salvation to the Gentiles. By doing this, they continue to pile up their sins. But the anger of God has caught up with them at last.
521Th 2:17 Dear brothers and sisters, after we were separated from you for a little while (though our hearts never left you), we tried very hard to come back because of our intense longing to see you again.
521Th 2:18 We wanted very much to come to you, and I, Paul, tried again and again, but Satan prevented us.
521Th 2:19 After all, what gives us hope and joy, and what will be our proud reward and crown as we stand before our Lord Jesus when he returns? It is you!
521Th 2:20 Yes, you are our pride and joy.
521Th 3:1 Finally, when we could stand it no longer, we decided to stay alone in Athens,
521Th 3:2 and we sent Timothy to visit you. He is our brother and God's co-worker�� in proclaiming the Good News of Christ. We sent him to strengthen you, to encourage you in your faith, / ��Other manuscripts read and God's servant; still others read and a co-worker, or and a servant and co-worker for God, or and God's servant and our co-worker
521Th 3:3 and to keep you from being shaken by the troubles you were going through. But you know that we are destined for such troubles.
521Th 3:4 Even while we were with you, we warned you that troubles would soon come - and they did, as you well know.
521Th 3:5 That is why, when I could bear it no longer, I sent Timothy to find out whether your faith was still strong. I was afraid that the tempter had gotten the best of you and that our work had been useless.
521Th 3:6 But now Timothy has just returned, bringing us good news about your faith and love. He reports that you always remember our visit with joy and that you want to see us as much as we want to see you.
521Th 3:7 So we have been greatly encouraged in the midst of our troubles and suffering, dear brothers and sisters��, because you have remained strong in your faith. / ��Greek brothers
521Th 3:8 It gives us new life to know that you are standing firm in the Lord.
521Th 3:9 How we thank God for you! Because of you we have great joy as we enter God's presence.
521Th 3:10 Night and day we pray earnestly for you, asking God to let us see you again to fill the gaps in your faith.
521Th 3:11 May God our Father and our Lord Jesus bring us to you very soon.
521Th 3:12 And may the Lord make your love for one another and for all people grow and overflow, just as our love for you overflows.
521Th 3:13 May he, as a result, make your hearts strong, blameless, and holy as you stand before God our Father when our Lord Jesus comes again with all his holy people. Amen.
521Th 4:1 Finally, dear brothers and sisters��, we urge you in the name of the Lord Jesus to live in a way that pleases God, as we have taught you. You live this way already, and we encourage you to do so even more. / ��Greek brothers; also in 4.10, 13
521Th 4:2 For you remember what we taught you by the authority of the Lord Jesus.
521Th 4:3 God's will is for you to be holy, so stay away from all sexual sin.
521Th 4:4 Then each of you will control his own body�� and live in holiness and honor - / ��Or will know how to take a wife for himself; or will learn to live with his own wife; Greek reads will know how to possess his own vessel
521Th 4:5 not in lustful passion like the pagans who do not know God and his ways.
521Th 4:6 Never harm or cheat a Christian brother in this matter by violating his wife��, for the Lord avenges all such sins, as we have solemnly warned you before. / ��Greek Never harm or cheat a brother in this matter
521Th 4:7 God has called us to live holy lives, not impure lives.
521Th 4:8 Therefore, anyone who refuses to live by these rules is not disobeying human teaching but is rejecting God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
521Th 4:9 But we don't need to write to you about the importance of loving each other��, for God himself has taught you to love one another. / ��Greek about brotherly love
521Th 4:10 Indeed, you already show your love for all the believers�� throughout Macedonia. Even so, dear brothers and sisters, we urge you to love them even more. / ��Greek the brothers
521Th 4:11 Make it your goal to live a quiet life, minding your own business and working with your hands, just as we instructed you before.
521Th 4:12 Then people who are not Christians will respect the way you live, and you will not need to depend on others.
521Th 4:13 And now, dear brothers and sisters, we want you to know what will happen to the believers who have died�� so you will not grieve like people who have no hope. / ��Greek those who have fallen asleep; also in 4.14
521Th 4:14 For since we believe that Jesus died and was raised to life again, we also believe that when Jesus returns, God will bring back with him the believers who have died.
521Th 4:15 We tell you this directly from the Lord�� We who are still living when the Lord returns will not meet him ahead of those who have died��. / ��Greek those who have fallen asleep
521Th 4:16 For the Lord himself will come down from heaven with a commanding shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. First, the Christians who have died�� will rise from their graves. / ��Greek the dead in Christ
521Th 4:17 Then, together with them, we who are still alive and remain on the earth will be caught up in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. Then we will be with the Lord forever.
521Th 4:18 So encourage each other with these words.
521Th 5:1 Now concerning how and when all this will happen, dear brothers and sisters��, we don't really need to write you. / ��Greek brothers; also in 5.4, 12, 14, 25, 26, 27
521Th 5:2 For you know quite well that the day of the Lord's return will come unexpectedly, like a thief in the night.
521Th 5:3 When people are saying, "Everything is peaceful and secure," then disaster will fall on them as suddenly as a pregnant woman's labor pains begin. And there will be no escape.
521Th 5:4 But you aren't in the dark about these things, dear brothers and sisters, and you won't be surprised when the day of the Lord comes like a thief��. / ��Some manuscripts read comes upon you as if you were thieves
521Th 5:5 For you are all children of the light and of the day; we don't belong to darkness and night.
521Th 5:6 So be on your guard, not asleep like the others. Stay alert and be clearheaded.
521Th 5:7 Night is the time when people sleep and drinkers get drunk.
521Th 5:8 But let us who live in the light be clearheaded, protected by the armor of faith and love, and wearing as our helmet the confidence of our salvation.
521Th 5:9 For God chose to save us through our Lord Jesus Christ, not to pour out his anger on us.
521Th 5:10 Christ died for us so that, whether we are dead or alive when he returns, we can live with him forever.
521Th 5:11 So encourage each other and build each other up, just as you are already doing.
521Th 5:12 Dear brothers and sisters, honor those who are your leaders in the Lord's work. They work hard among you and give you spiritual guidance.
521Th 5:13 Show them great respect and wholehearted love because of their work. And live peacefully with each other.
521Th 5:14 Brothers and sisters, we urge you to warn those who are lazy. Encourage those who are timid. Take tender care of those who are weak. Be patient with everyone.
521Th 5:15 See that no one pays back evil for evil, but always try to do good to each other and to all people.
521Th 5:16 Always be joyful.
521Th 5:17 Never stop praying.
521Th 5:18 Be thankful in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you who belong to Christ Jesus.
521Th 5:19 Do not stifle the Holy Spirit.
521Th 5:20 Do not scoff at prophecies,
521Th 5:21 but test everything that is said. Hold on to what is good.
521Th 5:22 Stay away from every kind of evil.
521Th 5:23 Now may the God of peace make you holy in every way, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again.
521Th 5:24 God will make this happen, for he who calls you is faithful.
521Th 5:25 Dear brothers and sisters, pray for us.
521Th 5:26 Greet all the brothers and sisters with Christian love��. / ��Greek with a holy kiss
521Th 5:27 I command you in the name of the Lord to read this letter to all the brothers and sisters.
521Th 5:28 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
53
532Th 1:1 This letter is from Paul, Silas��, and Timothy. We are writing to the church in Thessalonica, to you who belong to God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. / ��Greek Silvanus, the Greek form of the name
532Th 1:2 May God our Father�� and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace. / ��Some manuscripts read God the Father
532Th 1:3 Dear brothers and sisters��, we can't help but thank God for you, because your faith is flourishing and your love for one another is growing. / ��Greek Brothers
532Th 1:4 We proudly tell God's other churches about your endurance and faithfulness in all the persecutions and hardships you are suffering.
532Th 1:5 And God will use this persecution to show his justice and to make you worthy of his Kingdom, for which you are suffering.
532Th 1:6 In his justice he will pay back those who persecute you.
532Th 1:7 And God will provide rest for you who are being persecuted and also for us when the Lord Jesus appears from heaven. He will come with his mighty angels,
532Th 1:8 in flaming fire, bringing judgment on those who don't know God and on those who refuse to obey the Good News of our Lord Jesus.
532Th 1:9 They will be punished with eternal destruction, forever separated from the Lord and from his glorious power.
532Th 1:10 When he comes on that day, he will receive glory from his holy people - praise from all who believe. And this includes you, for you believed what we told you about him.
532Th 1:11 So we keep on praying for you, asking our God to enable you to live a life worthy of his call. May he give you the power to accomplish all the good things your faith prompts you to do.
532Th 1:12 Then the name of our Lord Jesus will be honored because of the way you live, and you will be honored along with him. This is all made possible because of the grace of our God and Lord, Jesus Christ��. / ��Or of our God and our Lord Jesus Christ
532Th 2:1 Now, dear brothers and sisters��, let us clarify some things about the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and how we will be gathered to meet him. / ��Greek brothers; also in 2.13, 15
532Th 2:2 Don't be so easily shaken or alarmed by those who say that the day of the Lord has already begun. Don't believe them, even if they claim to have had a spiritual vision, a revelation, or a letter supposedly from us.
532Th 2:3 Don't be fooled by what they say. For that day will not come until there is a great rebellion against God and the man of lawlessness�� is revealed - the one who brings destruction��. / ��Some manuscripts read the man of sin ��Greek the son of destruction
532Th 2:4 He will exalt himself and defy everything that people call god and every object of worship. He will even sit in the temple of God, claiming that he himself is God.
532Th 2:5 Don't you remember that I told you about all this when I was with you?
532Th 2:6 And you know what is holding him back, for he can be revealed only when his time comes.
532Th 2:7 For this lawlessness is already at work secretly, and it will remain secret until the one who is holding it back steps out of the way.
532Th 2:8 Then the man of lawlessness will be revealed, but the Lord Jesus will kill him with the breath of his mouth and destroy him by the splendor of his coming.
532Th 2:9 This man will come to do the work of Satan with counterfeit power and signs and miracles.
532Th 2:10 He will use every kind of evil deception to fool those on their way to destruction, because they refuse to love and accept the truth that would save them.
532Th 2:11 So God will cause them to be greatly deceived, and they will believe these lies.
532Th 2:12 Then they will be condemned for enjoying evil rather than believing the truth.
532Th 2:13 As for us, we can't help but thank God for you, dear brothers and sisters loved by the Lord. We are always thankful that God chose you to be among the first�� to experience salvation - a salvation that came through the Spirit who makes you holy and through your belief in the truth. / ��Some manuscripts read chose you from the very beginning
532Th 2:14 He called you to salvation when we told you the Good News; now you can share in the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 2:15 With all these things in mind, dear brothers and sisters, stand firm and keep a strong grip on the teaching we passed on to you both in person and by letter.
532Th 2:16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself and God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal comfort and a wonderful hope,
532Th 2:17 comfort you and strengthen you in every good thing you do and say.
532Th 3:1 Finally, dear brothers and sisters��, we ask you to pray for us. Pray that the Lord's message will spread rapidly and be honored wherever it goes, just as when it came to you. / ��Greek brothers; also in 3.6, 13
532Th 3:2 Pray, too, that we will be rescued from wicked and evil people, for not everyone is a believer.
532Th 3:3 But the Lord is faithful; he will strengthen you and guard you from the evil one��. / ��Or from evil
532Th 3:4 And we are confident in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do the things we commanded you.
532Th 3:5 May the Lord lead your hearts into a full understanding and expression of the love of God and the patient endurance that comes from Christ.
532Th 3:6 And now, dear brothers and sisters, we give you this command in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ�� Stay away from all believers�� who live idle lives and don't follow the tradition they received�� from us. / ��Greek from every brother ��Some manuscripts read you received
532Th 3:7 For you know that you ought to imitate us. We were not idle when we were with you.
532Th 3:8 We never accepted food from anyone without paying for it. We worked hard day and night so we would not be a burden to any of you.
532Th 3:9 We certainly had the right to ask you to feed us, but we wanted to give you an example to follow.
532Th 3:10 Even while we were with you, we gave you this command�� "Those unwilling to work will not get to eat."
532Th 3:11 Yet we hear that some of you are living idle lives, refusing to work and meddling in other people's business.
532Th 3:12 We command such people and urge them in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and work to earn their own living.
532Th 3:13 As for the rest of you, dear brothers and sisters, never get tired of doing good.
532Th 3:14 Take note of those who refuse to obey what we say in this letter. Stay away from them so they will be ashamed.
532Th 3:15 Don't think of them as enemies, but warn them as you would a brother or sister��. / ��Greek as a brother
532Th 3:16 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you his peace at all times and in every situation. The Lord be with you all.
532Th 3:17 HERE IS MY GREETING IN MY OWN HANDWRITING - PAUL. I DO THIS IN ALL MY LETTERS TO PROVE THEY ARE FROM ME.
532Th 3:18 May the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
54
541Tm 1:1 This letter is from Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus, appointed by the command of God our Savior and Christ Jesus, who gives us hope.
541Tm 1:2 I am writing to Timothy, my true son in the faith. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace, mercy, and peace.
541Tm 1:3 When I left for Macedonia, I urged you to stay there in Ephesus and stop those whose teaching is contrary to the truth.
541Tm 1:4 Don't let them waste their time in endless discussion of myths and spiritual pedigrees. These things only lead to meaningless speculations��, which don't help people live a life of faith in God��. / ��Greek in myths and endless genealogies, which cause speculation ��Greek a stewardship of God in faith
541Tm 1:5 The purpose of my instruction is that all believers would be filled with love that comes from a pure heart, a clear conscience, and genuine faith.
541Tm 1:6 But some people have missed this whole point. They have turned away from these things and spend their time in meaningless discussions.
541Tm 1:7 They want to be known as teachers of the law of Moses, but they don't know what they are talking about, even though they speak so confidently.
541Tm 1:8 We know that the law is good when used correctly.
541Tm 1:9 For the law was not intended for people who do what is right. It is for people who are lawless and rebellious, who are ungodly and sinful, who consider nothing sacred and defile what is holy, who kill their father or mother or commit other murders.
541Tm 1:10 The law is for people who are sexually immoral, or who practice homosexuality, or are slave traders��, liars, promise breakers, or who do anything else that contradicts the wholesome teaching / ��Or kidnappers
541Tm 1:11 that comes from the glorious Good News entrusted to me by our blessed God.
541Tm 1:12 I thank Christ Jesus our Lord, who has given me strength to do his work. He considered me trustworthy and appointed me to serve him,
541Tm 1:13 even though I used to blaspheme the name of Christ. In my insolence, I persecuted his people. But God had mercy on me because I did it in ignorance and unbelief.
541Tm 1:14 Oh, how generous and gracious our Lord was! He filled me with the faith and love that come from Christ Jesus.
541Tm 1:15 This is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it�� "Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners" - and I am the worst of them all.
541Tm 1:16 But God had mercy on me so that Christ Jesus could use me as a prime example of his great patience with even the worst sinners. Then others will realize that they, too, can believe in him and receive eternal life.
541Tm 1:17 All honor and glory to God forever and ever! He is the eternal King, the unseen one who never dies; he alone is God. Amen.
541Tm 1:18 Timothy, my son, here are my instructions for you, based on the prophetic words spoken about you earlier. May they help you fight well in the Lord's battles.
541Tm 1:19 Cling to your faith in Christ, and keep your conscience clear. For some people have deliberately violated their consciences; as a result, their faith has been shipwrecked.
541Tm 1:20 Hymenaeus and Alexander are two examples. I threw them out and handed them over to Satan so they might learn not to blaspheme God.
541Tm 2:1 I urge you, first of all, to pray for all people. Ask God to help them; intercede on their behalf, and give thanks for them.
541Tm 2:2 Pray this way for kings and all who are in authority so that we can live peaceful and quiet lives marked by godliness and dignity.
541Tm 2:3 This is good and pleases God our Savior,
541Tm 2:4 who wants everyone to be saved and to understand the truth.
541Tm 2:5 For there is only one God and one Mediator who can reconcile God and humanity - the man Christ Jesus.
541Tm 2:6 He gave his life to purchase freedom for everyone. This is the message God gave to the world at just the right time.
541Tm 2:7 And I have been chosen as a preacher and apostle to teach the Gentiles this message about faith and truth. I'm not exaggerating - just telling the truth.
541Tm 2:8 In every place of worship, I want men to pray with holy hands lifted up to God, free from anger and controversy.
541Tm 2:9 And I want women to be modest in their appearance��. They should wear decent and appropriate clothing and not draw attention to themselves by the way they fix their hair or by wearing gold or pearls or expensive clothes. / ��Or to pray in modest apparel
541Tm 2:10 For women who claim to be devoted to God should make themselves attractive by the good things they do.
541Tm 2:11 Women should learn quietly and submissively.
541Tm 2:12 I do not let women teach men or have authority over them��. Let them listen quietly. / ��Or teach men or usurp their authority
541Tm 2:13 For God made Adam first, and afterward he made Eve.
541Tm 2:14 And it was not Adam who was deceived by Satan. The woman was deceived, and sin was the result.
541Tm 2:15 But women will be saved through childbearing��, assuming they continue to live in faith, love, holiness, and modesty. / ��Or will be saved by accepting their role as mothers, or will be saved by the birth of the Child
541Tm 3:1 This is a trustworthy saying�� "If someone aspires to be an elder��, he desires an honorable position." / ��Or an overseer, or a bishop; also in 3.2, 6
541Tm 3:2 So an elder must be a man whose life is above reproach. He must be faithful to his wife��. He must exercise self-control, live wisely, and have a good reputation. He must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must be able to teach. / ��Or must have only one wife, or must be married only once; Greek reads must be the husband of one wife; also in 3.12
541Tm 3:3 He must not be a heavy drinker�� or be violent. He must be gentle, not quarrelsome, and not love money. / ��Greek must not drink too much wine; similarly in 3.8
541Tm 3:4 He must manage his own family well, having children who respect and obey him.
541Tm 3:5 For if a man cannot manage his own household, how can he take care of God's church?
541Tm 3:6 An elder must not be a new believer, because he might become proud, and the devil would cause him to fall��. / ��Or he might fall into the same judgment as the devil
541Tm 3:7 Also, people outside the church must speak well of him so that he will not be disgraced and fall into the devil's trap.
541Tm 3:8 In the same way, deacons must be well respected and have integrity. They must not be heavy drinkers or dishonest with money.
541Tm 3:9 They must be committed to the mystery of the faith now revealed and must live with a clear conscience.
541Tm 3:10 Before they are appointed as deacons, let them be closely examined. If they pass the test, then let them serve as deacons.
541Tm 3:11 In the same way, their wives�� must be respected and must not slander others. They must exercise self-control and be faithful in everything they do. / ��Or the women deacons. The Greek word can be translated women or wives
541Tm 3:12 A deacon must be faithful to his wife, and he must manage his children and household well.
541Tm 3:13 Those who do well as deacons will be rewarded with respect from others and will have increased confidence in their faith in Christ Jesus.
541Tm 3:14 I am writing these things to you now, even though I hope to be with you soon,
541Tm 3:15 so that if I am delayed, you will know how people must conduct themselves in the household of God. This is the church of the living God, which is the pillar and foundation of the truth.
541Tm 3:16 Without question, this is the great mystery of our faith�磺 Christ�� was revealed in a human body and vindicated by the Spirit��. He was seen by angels and announced to the nations. He was believed in throughout the world and taken to heaven in glory. / ��Or of godliness ��Greek He who; other manuscripts read God ��Or in his spirit
541Tm 4:1 Now the Holy Spirit tells us clearly that in the last times some will turn away from the true faith; they will follow deceptive spirits and teachings that come from demons.
541Tm 4:2 These people are hypocrites and liars, and their consciences are dead��. / ��Greek are seared
541Tm 4:3 They will say it is wrong to be married and wrong to eat certain foods. But God created those foods to be eaten with thanks by faithful people who know the truth.
541Tm 4:4 Since everything God created is good, we should not reject any of it but receive it with thanks.
541Tm 4:5 For we know it is made acceptable�� by the word of God and prayer. / ��Or made holy
541Tm 4:6 If you explain these things to the brothers and sisters��, Timothy, you will be a worthy servant of Christ Jesus, one who is nourished by the message of faith and the good teaching you have followed. / ��Greek brothers
541Tm 4:7 Do not waste time arguing over godless ideas and old wives' tales. Instead, train yourself to be godly.
541Tm 4:8 "Physical training is good, but training for godliness is much better, promising benefits in this life and in the life to come."
541Tm 4:9 This is a trustworthy saying, and everyone should accept it.
541Tm 4:10 This is why we work hard and continue to struggle��, for our hope is in the living God, who is the Savior of all people and particularly of all believers. / ��Some manuscripts read continue to suffer
541Tm 4:11 Teach these things and insist that everyone learn them.
541Tm 4:12 Don't let anyone think less of you because you are young. Be an example to all believers in what you say, in the way you live, in your love, your faith, and your purity.
541Tm 4:13 Until I get there, focus on reading the Scriptures to the church, encouraging the believers, and teaching them.
541Tm 4:14 Do not neglect the spiritual gift you received through the prophecy spoken over you when the elders of the church laid their hands on you.
541Tm 4:15 Give your complete attention to these matters. Throw yourself into your tasks so that everyone will see your progress.
541Tm 4:16 Keep a close watch on how you live and on your teaching. Stay true to what is right for the sake of your own salvation and the salvation of those who hear you.
541Tm 5:1 Never speak harshly to an older man��, but appeal to him respectfully as you would to your own father. Talk to younger men as you would to your own brothers. / ��Or an elder
541Tm 5:2 Treat older women as you would your mother, and treat younger women with all purity as you would your own sisters.
541Tm 5:3 Take care of�� any widow who has no one else to care for her. / ��Or Honor
541Tm 5:4 But if she has children or grandchildren, their first responsibility is to show godliness at home and repay their parents by taking care of them. This is something that pleases God.
541Tm 5:5 Now a true widow, a woman who is truly alone in this world, has placed her hope in God. She prays night and day, asking God for his help.
541Tm 5:6 But the widow who lives only for pleasure is spiritually dead even while she lives.
541Tm 5:7 Give these instructions to the church so that no one will be open to criticism.
541Tm 5:8 But those who won't care for their relatives, especially those in their own household, have denied the true faith. Such people are worse than unbelievers.
541Tm 5:9 A widow who is put on the list for support must be a woman who is at least sixty years old and was faithful to her husband��. / ��Greek was the wife of one husband
541Tm 5:10 She must be well respected by everyone because of the good she has done. Has she brought up her children well? Has she been kind to strangers and served other believers humbly��? Has she helped those who are in trouble? Has she always been ready to do good? / ��Greek and washed the feet of God's holy people
541Tm 5:11 The younger widows should not be on the list, because their physical desires will overpower their devotion to Christ and they will want to remarry.
541Tm 5:12 Then they would be guilty of breaking their previous pledge.
541Tm 5:13 And if they are on the list, they will learn to be lazy and will spend their time gossiping from house to house, meddling in other people's business and talking about things they shouldn't.
541Tm 5:14 So I advise these younger widows to marry again, have children, and take care of their own homes. Then the enemy will not be able to say anything against them.
541Tm 5:15 For I am afraid that some of them have already gone astray and now follow Satan.
541Tm 5:16 If a woman who is a believer has relatives who are widows, she must take care of them and not put the responsibility on the church. Then the church can care for the widows who are truly alone.
541Tm 5:17 Elders who do their work well should be respected and paid well��, especially those who work hard at both preaching and teaching. / ��Greek should be worthy of double honor
541Tm 5:18 For the Scripture says, "You must not muzzle an ox to keep it from eating as it treads out the grain." And in another place, "Those who work deserve their pay!"�� / ��Deut 25.4; Luke 10.7
541Tm 5:19 Do not listen to an accusation against an elder unless it is confirmed by two or three witnesses.
541Tm 5:20 Those who sin should be reprimanded in front of the whole church; this will serve as a strong warning to others.
541Tm 5:21 I solemnly command you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus and the highest angels to obey these instructions without taking sides or showing favoritism to anyone.
541Tm 5:22 Never be in a hurry about appointing a church leader��. Do not share in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure. / ��Greek about the laying on of hands
541Tm 5:23 Don't drink only water. You ought to drink a little wine for the sake of your stomach because you are sick so often.
541Tm 5:24 Remember, the sins of some people are obvious, leading them to certain judgment. But there are others whose sins will not be revealed until later.
541Tm 5:25 In the same way, the good deeds of some people are obvious. And the good deeds done in secret will someday come to light.
541Tm 6:1 All slaves should show full respect for their masters so they will not bring shame on the name of God and his teaching.
541Tm 6:2 If the masters are believers, that is no excuse for being disrespectful. Those slaves should work all the harder because their efforts are helping other believers�� who are well loved. Teach these things, Timothy, and encourage everyone to obey them. / ��Greek brothers
541Tm 6:3 Some people may contradict our teaching, but these are the wholesome teachings of the Lord Jesus Christ. These teachings promote a godly life.
541Tm 6:4 Anyone who teaches something different is arrogant and lacks understanding. Such a person has an unhealthy desire to quibble over the meaning of words. This stirs up arguments ending in jealousy, division, slander, and evil suspicions.
541Tm 6:5 These people always cause trouble. Their minds are corrupt, and they have turned their backs on the truth. To them, a show of godliness is just a way to become wealthy.
541Tm 6:6 Yet true godliness with contentment is itself great wealth.
541Tm 6:7 After all, we brought nothing with us when we came into the world, and we can't take anything with us when we leave it.
541Tm 6:8 So if we have enough food and clothing, let us be content.
541Tm 6:9 But people who long to be rich fall into temptation and are trapped by many foolish and harmful desires that plunge them into ruin and destruction.
541Tm 6:10 For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evil. And some people, craving money, have wandered from the true faith and pierced themselves with many sorrows.
541Tm 6:11 But you, Timothy, are a man of God; so run from all these evil things. Pursue righteousness and a godly life, along with faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.
541Tm 6:12 Fight the good fight for the true faith. Hold tightly to the eternal life to which God has called you, which you have confessed so well before many witnesses.
541Tm 6:13 And I charge you before God, who gives life to all, and before Christ Jesus, who gave a good testimony before Pontius Pilate,
541Tm 6:14 that you obey this command without wavering. Then no one can find fault with you from now until our Lord Jesus Christ comes again.
541Tm 6:15 For at just the right time Christ will be revealed from heaven by the blessed and only almighty God, the King of all kings and Lord of all lords.
541Tm 6:16 He alone can never die, and he lives in light so brilliant that no human can approach him. No human eye has ever seen him, nor ever will. All honor and power to him forever! Amen.
541Tm 6:17 Teach those who are rich in this world not to be proud and not to trust in their money, which is so unreliable. Their trust should be in God, who richly gives us all we need for our enjoyment.
541Tm 6:18 Tell them to use their money to do good. They should be rich in good works and generous to those in need, always being ready to share with others.
541Tm 6:19 By doing this they will be storing up their treasure as a good foundation for the future so that they may experience true life.
541Tm 6:20 Timothy, guard what God has entrusted to you. Avoid godless, foolish discussions with those who oppose you with their so-called knowledge.
541Tm 6:21 Some people have wandered from the faith by following such foolishness. May God's grace be with you all.

552Tm 1:1 This letter is from Paul, chosen by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus. I have been sent out to tell others about the life he has promised through faith in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 1:2 I am writing to Timothy, my dear son. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord give you grace, mercy, and peace.
552Tm 1:3 Timothy, I thank God for you - the God I serve with a clear conscience, just as my ancestors did. Night and day I constantly remember you in my prayers.
552Tm 1:4 I long to see you again, for I remember your tears as we parted. And I will be filled with joy when we are together again.
552Tm 1:5 I remember your genuine faith, for you share the faith that first filled your grandmother Lois and your mother, Eunice. And I know that same faith continues strong in you.
552Tm 1:6 This is why I remind you to fan into flames the spiritual gift God gave you when I laid my hands on you.
552Tm 1:7 For God has not given us a spirit of fear and timidity, but of power, love, and self-discipline.
552Tm 1:8 So never be ashamed to tell others about our Lord. And don't be ashamed of me, either, even though I'm in prison for him. With the strength God gives you, be ready to suffer with me for the sake of the Good News.
552Tm 1:9 For God saved us and called us to live a holy life. He did this, not because we deserved it, but because that was his plan from before the beginning of time - to show us his grace through Christ Jesus.
552Tm 1:10 And now he has made all of this plain to us by the appearing of Christ Jesus, our Savior. He broke the power of death and illuminated the way to life and immortality through the Good News.
552Tm 1:11 And God chose me to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of this Good News.
552Tm 1:12 That is why I am suffering here in prison. But I am not ashamed of it, for I know the one in whom I trust, and I am sure that he is able to guard what I have entrusted to him�� until the day of his return. / ��Or what has been entrusted to me
552Tm 1:13 Hold on to the pattern of wholesome teaching you learned from me - a pattern shaped by the faith and love that you have in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 1:14 Through the power of the Holy Spirit who lives within us, carefully guard the precious truth that has been entrusted to you.
552Tm 1:15 As you know, everyone from the province of Asia has deserted me - even Phygelus and Hermogenes.
552Tm 1:16 May the Lord show special kindness to Onesiphorus and all his family because he often visited and encouraged me. He was never ashamed of me because I was in chains.
552Tm 1:17 When he came to Rome, he searched everywhere until he found me.
552Tm 1:18 May the Lord show him special kindness on the day of Christ's return. And you know very well how helpful he was in Ephesus.
552Tm 2:1 Timothy, my dear son, be strong through the grace that God gives you in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 2:2 You have heard me teach things that have been confirmed by many reliable witnesses. Now teach these truths to other trustworthy people who will be able to pass them on to others.
552Tm 2:3 Endure suffering along with me, as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
552Tm 2:4 Soldiers don't get tied up in the affairs of civilian life, for then they cannot please the officer who enlisted them.
552Tm 2:5 And athletes cannot win the prize unless they follow the rules.
552Tm 2:6 And hardworking farmers should be the first to enjoy the fruit of their labor.
552Tm 2:7 Think about what I am saying. The Lord will help you understand all these things.
552Tm 2:8 Always remember that Jesus Christ, a descendant of King David, was raised from the dead. This is the Good News I preach.
552Tm 2:9 And because I preach this Good News, I am suffering and have been chained like a criminal. But the word of God cannot be chained.
552Tm 2:10 So I am willing to endure anything if it will bring salvation and eternal glory in Christ Jesus to those God has chosen.
552Tm 2:11 This is a trustworthy saying�� If we die with him, we will also live with him.
552Tm 2:12 If we endure hardship, we will reign with him. If we deny him, he will deny us.
552Tm 2:13 If we are unfaithful, he remains faithful, for he cannot deny who he is.
552Tm 2:14 Remind everyone about these things, and command them in God's presence to stop fighting over words. Such arguments are useless, and they can ruin those who hear them.
552Tm 2:15 Work hard so you can present yourself to God and receive his approval. Be a good worker, one who does not need to be ashamed and who correctly explains the word of truth.
552Tm 2:16 Avoid worthless, foolish talk that only leads to more godless behavior.
552Tm 2:17 This kind of talk spreads like cancer��, as in the case of Hymenaeus and Philetus. / ��Greek gangrene
552Tm 2:18 They have left the path of truth, claiming that the resurrection of the dead has already occurred; in this way, they have turned some people away from the faith.
552Tm 2:19 But God's truth stands firm like a foundation stone with this inscription�� "The LORD knows those who are his,"�� and "All who belong to the LORD must turn away from evil."�� / ��Num 16.5 ��See Isa 52.11
552Tm 2:20 In a wealthy home some utensils are made of gold and silver, and some are made of wood and clay. The expensive utensils are used for special occasions, and the cheap ones are for everyday use.
552Tm 2:21 If you keep yourself pure, you will be a special utensil for honorable use. Your life will be clean, and you will be ready for the Master to use you for every good work.
552Tm 2:22 Run from anything that stimulates youthful lusts. Instead, pursue righteous living, faithfulness, love, and peace. Enjoy the companionship of those who call on the Lord with pure hearts.
552Tm 2:23 Again I say, don't get involved in foolish, ignorant arguments that only start fights.
552Tm 2:24 A servant of the Lord must not quarrel but must be kind to everyone, be able to teach, and be patient with difficult people.
552Tm 2:25 Gently instruct those who oppose the truth. Perhaps God will change those people's hearts, and they will learn the truth.
552Tm 2:26 Then they will come to their senses and escape from the devil's trap. For they have been held captive by him to do whatever he wants.
552Tm 3:1 You should know this, Timothy, that in the last days there will be very difficult times.
552Tm 3:2 For people will love only themselves and their money. They will be boastful and proud, scoffing at God, disobedient to their parents, and ungrateful. They will consider nothing sacred.
552Tm 3:3 They will be unloving and unforgiving; they will slander others and have no self-control. They will be cruel and hate what is good.
552Tm 3:4 They will betray their friends, be reckless, be puffed up with pride, and love pleasure rather than God.
552Tm 3:5 They will act religious, but they will reject the power that could make them godly. Stay away from people like that!
552Tm 3:6 They are the kind who work their way into people's homes and win the confidence of�� vulnerable women who are burdened with the guilt of sin and controlled by various desires. / ��Greek and take captive
552Tm 3:7 (Such women are forever following new teachings, but they are never able to understand the truth.)
552Tm 3:8 These teachers oppose the truth just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses. They have depraved minds and a counterfeit faith.
552Tm 3:9 But they won't get away with this for long. Someday everyone will recognize what fools they are, just as with Jannes and Jambres.
552Tm 3:10 But you, Timothy, certainly know what I teach, and how I live, and what my purpose in life is. You know my faith, my patience, my love, and my endurance.
552Tm 3:11 You know how much persecution and suffering I have endured. You know all about how I was persecuted in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra - but the Lord rescued me from all of it.
552Tm 3:12 Yes, and everyone who wants to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will suffer persecution.
552Tm 3:13 But evil people and impostors will flourish. They will deceive others and will themselves be deceived.
552Tm 3:14 But you must remain faithful to the things you have been taught. You know they are true, for you know you can trust those who taught you.
552Tm 3:15 You have been taught the holy Scriptures from childhood, and they have given you the wisdom to receive the salvation that comes by trusting in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 3:16 All Scripture is inspired by God and is useful to teach us what is true and to make us realize what is wrong in our lives. It corrects us when we are wrong and teaches us to do what is right.
552Tm 3:17 God uses it to prepare and equip his people to do every good work.
552Tm 4:1 I solemnly urge you in the presence of God and Christ Jesus, who will someday judge the living and the dead when he appears to set up his Kingdom.
552Tm 4:2 Preach the word of God. Be prepared, whether the time is favorable or not. Patiently correct, rebuke, and encourage your people with good teaching.
552Tm 4:3 For a time is coming when people will no longer listen to sound and wholesome teaching. They will follow their own desires and will look for teachers who will tell them whatever their itching ears want to hear.
552Tm 4:4 They will reject the truth and chase after myths.
552Tm 4:5 But you should keep a clear mind in every situation. Don't be afraid of suffering for the Lord. Work at telling others the Good News, and fully carry out the ministry God has given you.
552Tm 4:6 As for me, my life has already been poured out as an offering to God. The time of my death is near.
552Tm 4:7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, and I have remained faithful.
552Tm 4:8 And now the prize awaits me - the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give me on the day of his return. And the prize is not just for me but for all who eagerly look forward to his appearing.
552Tm 4:9 Timothy, please come as soon as you can.
552Tm 4:10 Demas has deserted me because he loves the things of this life and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus has gone to Dalmatia.
552Tm 4:11 Only Luke is with me. Bring Mark with you when you come, for he will be helpful to me in my ministry.
552Tm 4:12 I sent Tychicus to Ephesus.
552Tm 4:13 When you come, be sure to bring the coat I left with Carpus at Troas. Also bring my books, and especially my papers��. / ��Greek especially the parchments
552Tm 4:14 Alexander the coppersmith did me much harm, but the Lord will judge him for what he has done.
552Tm 4:15 Be careful of him, for he fought against everything we said.
552Tm 4:16 The first time I was brought before the judge, no one came with me. Everyone abandoned me. May it not be counted against them.
552Tm 4:17 But the Lord stood with me and gave me strength so that I might preach the Good News in its entirety for all the Gentiles to hear. And he rescued me from certain death��. / ��Greek from the mouth of a lion
552Tm 4:18 Yes, and the Lord will deliver me from every evil attack and will bring me safely into his heavenly Kingdom. All glory to God forever and ever! Amen.
552Tm 4:19 Give my greetings to Priscilla and Aquila and those living in the household of Onesiphorus.
552Tm 4:20 Erastus stayed at Corinth, and I left Trophimus sick at Miletus.
552Tm 4:21 Do your best to get here before winter. Eubulus sends you greetings, and so do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers and sisters��. / ��Greek brothers
552Tm 4:22 May the Lord be with your spirit. And may his grace be with all of you.

56Ti 1:1 This letter is from Paul, a slave of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ. I have been sent to proclaim faith to�� those God has chosen and to teach them to know the truth that shows them how to live godly lives. / ��Or to strengthen the faith of
56Ti 1:2 This truth gives them confidence that they have eternal life, which God - who does not lie - promised them before the world began.
56Ti 1:3 And now at just the right time he has revealed this message, which we announce to everyone. It is by the command of God our Savior that I have been entrusted with this work for him.
56Ti 1:4 I am writing to Titus, my true son in the faith that we share. May God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior give you grace and peace.
56Ti 1:5 I left you on the island of Crete so you could complete our work there and appoint elders in each town as I instructed you.
56Ti 1:6 An elder must live a blameless life. He must be faithful to his wife��, and his children must be believers who don't have a reputation for being wild or rebellious. / ��Or must have only one wife, or must be married only once; Greek reads must be the husband of one wife
56Ti 1:7 An elder�� is a manager of God's household, so he must live a blameless life. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered; he must not be a heavy drinker��, violent, or dishonest with money. / ��Or An overseer, or A bishop ��Greek must not drink too much wine
56Ti 1:8 Rather, he must enjoy having guests in his home, and he must love what is good. He must live wisely and be just. He must live a devout and disciplined life.
56Ti 1:9 He must have a strong belief in the trustworthy message he was taught; then he will be able to encourage others with wholesome teaching and show those who oppose it where they are wrong.
56Ti 1:10 For there are many rebellious people who engage in useless talk and deceive others. This is especially true of those who insist on circumcision for salvation.
56Ti 1:11 They must be silenced, because they are turning whole families away from the truth by their false teaching. And they do it only for money.
56Ti 1:12 Even one of their own men, a prophet from Crete, has said about them, "The people of Crete are all liars, cruel animals, and lazy gluttons."�� / ��This quotation is from Epimenides of Knossos
56Ti 1:13 This is true. So reprimand them sternly to make them strong in the faith.
56Ti 1:14 They must stop listening to Jewish myths and the commands of people who have turned away from the truth.
56Ti 1:15 Everything is pure to those whose hearts are pure. But nothing is pure to those who are corrupt and unbelieving, because their minds and consciences are corrupted.
56Ti 1:16 Such people claim they know God, but they deny him by the way they live. They are detestable and disobedient, worthless for doing anything good.
56Ti 2:1 As for you, Titus, promote the kind of living that reflects wholesome teaching.
56Ti 2:2 Teach the older men to exercise self-control, to be worthy of respect, and to live wisely. They must have sound faith and be filled with love and patience.
56Ti 2:3 Similarly, teach the older women to live in a way that honors God. They must not slander others or be heavy drinkers��. Instead, they should teach others what is good. / ��Greek be enslaved to much wine
56Ti 2:4 These older women must train the younger women to love their husbands and their children,
56Ti 2:5 to live wisely and be pure, to work in their homes��, to do good, and to be submissive to their husbands. Then they will not bring shame on the word of God. / ��Some manuscripts read to care for their homes
56Ti 2:6 In the same way, encourage the young men to live wisely.
56Ti 2:7 And you yourself must be an example to them by doing good works of every kind. Let everything you do reflect the integrity and seriousness of your teaching.
56Ti 2:8 Teach the truth so that your teaching can't be criticized. Then those who oppose us will be ashamed and have nothing bad to say about us.
56Ti 2:9 Slaves must always obey their masters and do their best to please them. They must not talk back
56Ti 2:10 or steal, but must show themselves to be entirely trustworthy and good. Then they will make the teaching about God our Savior attractive in every way.
56Ti 2:11 For the grace of God has been revealed, bringing salvation to all people.
56Ti 2:12 And we are instructed to turn from godless living and sinful pleasures. We should live in this evil world with wisdom, righteousness, and devotion to God,
56Ti 2:13 while we look forward with hope to that wonderful day when the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, will be revealed.
56Ti 2:14 He gave his life to free us from every kind of sin, to cleanse us, and to make us his very own people, totally committed to doing good deeds.
56Ti 2:15 You must teach these things and encourage the believers to do them. You have the authority to correct them when necessary, so don't let anyone disregard what you say.
56Ti 3:1 Remind the believers to submit to the government and its officers. They should be obedient, always ready to do what is good.
56Ti 3:2 They must not slander anyone and must avoid quarreling. Instead, they should be gentle and show true humility to everyone.
56Ti 3:3 Once we, too, were foolish and disobedient. We were misled and became slaves to many lusts and pleasures. Our lives were full of evil and envy, and we hated each other.
56Ti 3:4 But - "When God our Savior revealed his kindness and love,
56Ti 3:5 he saved us, not because of the righteous things we had done, but because of his mercy. He washed away our sins, giving us a new birth and new life through the Holy Spirit��. / ��Greek He saved us through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit
56Ti 3:6 He generously poured out the Spirit upon us through Jesus Christ our Savior.
56Ti 3:7 Because of his grace he declared us righteous and gave us confidence that we will inherit eternal life."
56Ti 3:8 This is a trustworthy saying, and I want you to insist on these teachings so that all who trust in God will devote themselves to doing good. These teachings are good and beneficial for everyone.
56Ti 3:9 Do not get involved in foolish discussions about spiritual pedigrees�� or in quarrels and fights about obedience to Jewish laws. These things are useless and a waste of time. / ��Or spiritual genealogies
56Ti 3:10 If people are causing divisions among you, give a first and second warning. After that, have nothing more to do with them.
56Ti 3:11 For people like that have turned away from the truth, and their own sins condemn them.
56Ti 3:12 I am planning to send either Artemas or Tychicus to you. As soon as one of them arrives, do your best to meet me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to stay there for the winter.
56Ti 3:13 Do everything you can to help Zenas the lawyer and Apollos with their trip. See that they are given everything they need.
56Ti 3:14 Our people must learn to do good by meeting the urgent needs of others; then they will not be unproductive.
56Ti 3:15 Everybody here sends greetings. Please give my greetings to the believers - all who love us. May God's grace be with you all.

57Phm 1:1 This letter is from Paul, a prisoner for preaching the Good News about Christ Jesus, and from our brother Timothy. I am writing to Philemon, our beloved co-worker,
57Phm 1:2 and to our sister Apphia, and to our fellow soldier Archippus, and to the church that meets in your�� house. / ��Throughout this letter, you and your are singular except in verses 3, 22, and 25
57Phm 1:3 May God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ give you grace and peace.
57Phm 1:4 I always thank my God when I pray for you, Philemon,
57Phm 1:5 because I keep hearing about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all of God's people.
57Phm 1:6 And I am praying that you will put into action the generosity that comes from your faith as you understand and experience all the good things we have in Christ.
57Phm 1:7 Your love has given me much joy and comfort, my brother, for your kindness has often refreshed the hearts of God's people.
57Phm 1:8 That is why I am boldly asking a favor of you. I could demand it in the name of Christ because it is the right thing for you to do.
57Phm 1:9 But because of our love, I prefer simply to ask you. Consider this as a request from me - Paul, an old man and now also a prisoner for the sake of Christ Jesus��. / ��Or a prisoner of Christ Jesus
57Phm 1:10 I appeal to you to show kindness to my child, Onesimus. I became his father in the faith while here in prison.
57Phm 1:11 Onesimus�� hasn't been of much use to you in the past, but now he is very useful to both of us. / ��Onesimus means "useful"
57Phm 1:12 I am sending him back to you, and with him comes my own heart.
57Phm 1:13 I wanted to keep him here with me while I am in these chains for preaching the Good News, and he would have helped me on your behalf.
57Phm 1:14 But I didn't want to do anything without your consent. I wanted you to help because you were willing, not because you were forced.
57Phm 1:15 It seems you lost Onesimus for a little while so that you could have him back forever.
57Phm 1:16 He is no longer like a slave to you. He is more than a slave, for he is a beloved brother, especially to me. Now he will mean much more to you, both as a man and as a brother in the Lord.
57Phm 1:17 So if you consider me your partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
57Phm 1:18 If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to me.
57Phm 1:19 I, PAUL, WRITE THIS WITH MY OWN HAND�� I WILL REPAY IT. AND I WON'T MENTION THAT YOU OWE ME YOUR VERY SOUL!
57Phm 1:20 Yes, my brother, please do me this favor�� for the Lord's sake. Give me this encouragement in Christ. / ��Greek onaimen, a play on the name Onesimus

58Heb 1:1 Long ago God spoke many times and in many ways to our ancestors through the prophets.
58Heb 1:2 And now in these final days, he has spoken to us through his Son. God promised everything to the Son as an inheritance, and through the Son he created the universe.
58Heb 1:3 The Son radiates God's own glory and expresses the very character of God, and he sustains everything by the mighty power of his command. When he had cleansed us from our sins, he sat down in the place of honor at the right hand of the majestic God in heaven.
58Heb 1:4 This shows that the Son is far greater than the angels, just as the name God gave him is greater than their names.
58Heb 1:5 For God never said to any angel what he said to Jesus�� "You are my Son. Today I have become your Father��." God also said, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son."�� / ��Or Today I reveal you as my Son. Ps 2.7 ��2 Sam 7.14
58Heb 1:6 And when he brought his supreme Son into the world, God said��, "Let all of God's angels worship him."�� / ��Or when he again brings his supreme Son [or firstborn Son] into the world, God will say ��Deut 32.43
58Heb 1:7 Regarding the angels, he says, "He sends his angels like the winds, his servants like flames of fire."�� / ��Ps 104.4 (Greek version)
58Heb 1:8 But to the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, endures forever and ever. You rule with a scepter of justice.
58Heb 1:9 You love justice and hate evil. Therefore, O God, your God has anointed you, pouring out the oil of joy on you more than on anyone else."�� / ��Ps 45.6-7
58Heb 1:10 He also says to the Son, "In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundation of the earth and made the heavens with your hands.
58Heb 1:11 They will perish, but you remain forever. They will wear out like old clothing.
58Heb 1:12 You will fold them up like a cloak and discard them like old clothing. But you are always the same; you will live forever."�� / ��Ps 102.25-27
58Heb 1:13 And God never said to any of the angels, "Sit in the place of honor at my right hand until I humble your enemies, making them a footstool under your feet."�� / ��Ps 110.1
58Heb 1:14 Therefore, angels are only servants - spirits sent to care for people who will inherit salvation.
58Heb 2:1 So we must listen very carefully to the truth we have heard, or we may drift away from it.
58Heb 2:2 For the message God delivered through angels has always stood firm, and every violation of the law and every act of disobedience was punished.
58Heb 2:3 So what makes us think we can escape if we ignore this great salvation that was first announced by the Lord Jesus himself and then delivered to us by those who heard him speak?
58Heb 2:4 And God confirmed the message by giving signs and wonders and various miracles and gifts of the Holy Spirit whenever he chose.
58Heb 2:5 And furthermore, it is not angels who will control the future world we are talking about.
58Heb 2:6 For in one place the Scriptures say, "What are mere mortals that you should think about them, or a son of man�� that you should care for him? / ��Or the Son of Man
58Heb 2:7 Yet you made them only a little lower than the angels and crowned them with glory and honor��. / ��Some manuscripts add You gave them charge of everything you made
58Heb 2:8 You gave them authority over all things."�� Now when it says "all things," it means nothing is left out. But we have not yet seen all things put under their authority. / ��Ps 8.4-6 (Greek version)
58Heb 2:9 What we do see is Jesus, who was given a position "a little lower than the angels"; and because he suffered death for us, he is now "crowned with glory and honor." Yes, by God's grace, Jesus tasted death for everyone.
58Heb 2:10 God, for whom and through whom everything was made, chose to bring many children into glory. And it was only right that he should make Jesus, through his suffering, a perfect leader, fit to bring them into their salvation.
58Heb 2:11 So now Jesus and the ones he makes holy have the same Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them his brothers and sisters��. / ��Greek brothers; also in 2.12
58Heb 2:12 For he said to God, "I will proclaim your name to my brothers and sisters. I will praise you among your assembled people."�� / ��Ps 22.22
58Heb 2:13 He also said, "I will put my trust in him," that is, "I and the children God has given me."�� / ��Isa 8.17-18
58Heb 2:14 Because God's children are human beings - made of flesh and blood - the Son also became flesh and blood. For only as a human being could he die, and only by dying could he break the power of the devil, who had�� the power of death. / ��Or has
58Heb 2:15 Only in this way could he set free all who have lived their lives as slaves to the fear of dying.
58Heb 2:16 We also know that the Son did not come to help angels; he came to help the descendants of Abraham.
58Heb 2:17 Therefore, it was necessary for him to be made in every respect like us, his brothers and sisters��, so that he could be our merciful and faithful High Priest before God. Then he could offer a sacrifice that would take away the sins of the people. / ��Greek like the brothers
58Heb 2:18 Since he himself has gone through suffering and testing, he is able to help us when we are being tested.
58Heb 3:1 And so, dear brothers and sisters who belong to God and�� are partners with those called to heaven, think carefully about this Jesus whom we declare to be God's messenger�� and High Priest. / ��Greek And so, holy brothers who ��Greek God's apostle
58Heb 3:2 For he was faithful to God, who appointed him, just as Moses served faithfully when he was entrusted with God's entire�� house. / ��Some manuscripts do not include entire
58Heb 3:3 But Jesus deserves far more glory than Moses, just as a person who builds a house deserves more praise than the house itself.
58Heb 3:4 For every house has a builder, but the one who built everything is God.
58Heb 3:5 Moses was certainly faithful in God's house as a servant. His work was an illustration of the truths God would reveal later.
58Heb 3:6 But Christ, as the Son, is in charge of God's entire house. And we are God's house, if we keep our courage and remain confident in our hope in Christ��. / ��Some manuscripts add faithful to the end
58Heb 3:7 That is why the Holy Spirit says, "Today when you hear his voice,
58Heb 3:8 don't harden your hearts as Israel did when they rebelled, when they tested me in the wilderness.
58Heb 3:9 There your ancestors tested and tried my patience, even though they saw my miracles for forty years.
58Heb 3:10 So I was angry with them, and I said, 'Their hearts always turn away from me. They refuse to do what I tell them.'
58Heb 3:11 So in my anger I took an oath�� 'They will never enter my place of rest.'"�� / ��Ps 95.7-11
58Heb 3:12 Be careful then, dear brothers and sisters��. Make sure that your own hearts are not evil and unbelieving, turning you away from the living God. / ��Greek brothers
58Heb 3:13 You must warn each other every day, while it is still "today," so that none of you will be deceived by sin and hardened against God.
58Heb 3:14 For if we are faithful to the end, trusting God just as firmly as when we first believed, we will share in all that belongs to Christ.
58Heb 3:15 Remember what it says�� "Today when you hear his voice, don't harden your hearts as Israel did when they rebelled."�� / ��Ps 95.7-8
58Heb 3:16 And who was it who rebelled against God, even though they heard his voice? Wasn't it the people Moses led out of Egypt?
58Heb 3:17 And who made God angry for forty years? Wasn't it the people who sinned, whose corpses lay in the wilderness?
58Heb 3:18 And to whom was God speaking when he took an oath that they would never enter his rest? Wasn't it the people who disobeyed him?
58Heb 3:19 So we see that because of their unbelief they were not able to enter his rest.
58Heb 4:1 God's promise of entering his rest still stands, so we ought to tremble with fear that some of you might fail to experience it.
58Heb 4:2 For this good news - that God has prepared this rest - has been announced to us just as it was to them. But it did them no good because they didn't share the faith of those who listened to God��. / ��Some manuscripts read they didn't combine what they heard with faith
58Heb 4:3 For only we who believe can enter his rest. As for the others, God said, "In my anger I took an oath�� 'They will never enter my place of rest,'"�� even though this rest has been ready since he made the world. / ��Ps 95.11
58Heb 4:4 We know it is ready because of the place in the Scriptures where it mentions the seventh day�� "On the seventh day God rested from all his work."�� / ��Gen 2.2
58Heb 4:5 But in the other passage God said, "They will never enter my place of rest."�� / ��Ps 95.11
58Heb 4:6 So God's rest is there for people to enter, but those who first heard this good news failed to enter because they disobeyed God.
58Heb 4:7 So God set another time for entering his rest, and that time is today. God announced this through David much later in the words already quoted�� "Today when you hear his voice, don't harden your hearts."�� / ��Ps 95.7-8
58Heb 4:8 Now if Joshua had succeeded in giving them this rest, God would not have spoken about another day of rest still to come.
58Heb 4:9 So there is a special rest�� still waiting for the people of God. / ��Or a Sabbath rest
58Heb 4:10 For all who have entered into God's rest have rested from their labors, just as God did after creating the world.
58Heb 4:11 So let us do our best to enter that rest. But if we disobey God, as the people of Israel did, we will fall.
58Heb 4:12 For the word of God is alive and powerful. It is sharper than the sharpest two-edged sword, cutting between soul and spirit, between joint and marrow. It exposes our innermost thoughts and desires.
58Heb 4:13 Nothing in all creation is hidden from God. Everything is naked and exposed before his eyes, and he is the one to whom we are accountable.
58Heb 4:14 So then, since we have a great High Priest who has entered heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold firmly to what we believe.
58Heb 4:15 This High Priest of ours understands our weaknesses, for he faced all of the same testings we do, yet he did not sin.
58Heb 4:16 So let us come boldly to the throne of our gracious God. There we will receive his mercy, and we will find grace to help us when we need it most.
58Heb 5:1 Every high priest is a man chosen to represent other people in their dealings with God. He presents their gifts to God and offers sacrifices for their sins.
58Heb 5:2 And he is able to deal gently with ignorant and wayward people because he himself is subject to the same weaknesses.
58Heb 5:3 That is why he must offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as theirs.
58Heb 5:4 And no one can become a high priest simply because he wants such an honor. He must be called by God for this work, just as Aaron was.
58Heb 5:5 That is why Christ did not honor himself by assuming he could become High Priest. No, he was chosen by God, who said to him, "You are my Son. Today I have become your Father��." / ��Or Today I reveal you as my Son. Ps 2.7
58Heb 5:6 And in another passage God said to him, "You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."�� / ��Ps 110.4
58Heb 5:7 While Jesus was here on earth, he offered prayers and pleadings, with a loud cry and tears, to the one who could rescue him from death. And God heard his prayers because of his deep reverence for God.
58Heb 5:8 Even though Jesus was God's Son, he learned obedience from the things he suffered.
58Heb 5:9 In this way, God qualified him as a perfect High Priest, and he became the source of eternal salvation for all those who obey him.
58Heb 5:10 And God designated him to be a High Priest in the order of Melchizedek.
58Heb 5:11 There is much more we would like to say about this, but it is difficult to explain, especially since you are spiritually dull and don't seem to listen.
58Heb 5:12 You have been believers so long now that you ought to be teaching others. Instead, you need someone to teach you again the basic things about God's word��. You are like babies who need milk and cannot eat solid food. / ��Or about the oracles of God
58Heb 5:13 For someone who lives on milk is still an infant and doesn't know how to do what is right.
58Heb 5:14 Solid food is for those who are mature, who through training have the skill to recognize the difference between right and wrong.
58Heb 6:1 So let us stop going over the basic teachings about Christ again and again. Let us go on instead and become mature in our understanding. Surely we don't need to start again with the fundamental importance of repenting from evil deeds�� and placing our faith in God. / ��Greek from dead works
58Heb 6:2 You don't need further instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
58Heb 6:3 And so, God willing, we will move forward to further understanding.
58Heb 6:4 For it is impossible to bring back to repentance those who were once enlightened - those who have experienced the good things of heaven and shared in the Holy Spirit,
58Heb 6:5 who have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the power of the age to come - 
58Heb 6:6 and who then turn away from God. It is impossible to bring such people back to repentance; by rejecting the Son of God, they themselves are nailing him to the cross once again and holding him up to public shame.
58Heb 6:7 When the ground soaks up the falling rain and bears a good crop for the farmer, it has God's blessing.
58Heb 6:8 But if a field bears thorns and thistles, it is useless. The farmer will soon condemn that field and burn it.
58Heb 6:9 Dear friends, even though we are talking this way, we really don't believe it applies to you. We are confident that you are meant for better things, things that come with salvation.
58Heb 6:10 For God is not unjust. He will not forget how hard you have worked for him and how you have shown your love to him by caring for other believers��, as you still do. / ��Greek for God's holy people
58Heb 6:11 Our great desire is that you will keep on loving others as long as life lasts, in order to make certain that what you hope for will come true.
58Heb 6:12 Then you will not become spiritually dull and indifferent. Instead, you will follow the example of those who are going to inherit God's promises because of their faith and endurance.
58Heb 6:13 For example, there was God's promise to Abraham. Since there was no one greater to swear by, God took an oath in his own name, saying.
58Heb 6:14 "I will certainly bless you, and I will multiply your descendants beyond number."�� / ��Gen 22.17
58Heb 6:15 Then Abraham waited patiently, and he received what God had promised.
58Heb 6:16 Now when people take an oath, they call on someone greater than themselves to hold them to it. And without any question that oath is binding.
58Heb 6:17 God also bound himself with an oath, so that those who received the promise could be perfectly sure that he would never change his mind.
58Heb 6:18 So God has given both his promise and his oath. These two things are unchangeable because it is impossible for God to lie. Therefore, we who have fled to him for refuge can have great confidence as we hold to the hope that lies before us.
58Heb 6:19 This hope is a strong and trustworthy anchor for our souls. It leads us through the curtain into God's inner sanctuary.
58Heb 6:20 Jesus has already gone in there for us. He has become our eternal High Priest in the order of Melchizedek.
58Heb 7:1 This Melchizedek was king of the city of Salem and also a priest of God Most High. When Abraham was returning home after winning a great battle against the kings, Melchizedek met him and blessed him.
58Heb 7:2 Then Abraham took a tenth of all he had captured in battle and gave it to Melchizedek. The name Melchizedek means "king of justice," and king of Salem means "king of peace."
58Heb 7:3 There is no record of his father or mother or any of his ancestors - no beginning or end to his life. He remains a priest forever, resembling the Son of God.
58Heb 7:4 Consider then how great this Melchizedek was. Even Abraham, the great patriarch of Israel, recognized this by giving him a tenth of what he had taken in battle.
58Heb 7:5 Now the law of Moses required that the priests, who are descendants of Levi, must collect a tithe from the rest of the people of Israel��, who are also descendants of Abraham. / ��Greek from their brothers
58Heb 7:6 But Melchizedek, who was not a descendant of Levi, collected a tenth from Abraham. And Melchizedek placed a blessing upon Abraham, the one who had already received the promises of God.
58Heb 7:7 And without question, the person who has the power to give a blessing is greater than the one who is blessed.
58Heb 7:8 The priests who collect tithes are men who die, so Melchizedek is greater than they are, because we are told that he lives on.
58Heb 7:9 In addition, we might even say that these Levites - the ones who collect the tithe - paid a tithe to Melchizedek when their ancestor Abraham paid a tithe to him.
58Heb 7:10 For although Levi wasn't born yet, the seed from which he came was in Abraham's body when Melchizedek collected the tithe from him.
58Heb 7:11 So if the priesthood of Levi, on which the law was based, could have achieved the perfection God intended, why did God need to establish a different priesthood, with a priest in the order of Melchizedek instead of the order of Levi and Aaron��? / ��Greek the order of Aaron
58Heb 7:12 And if the priesthood is changed, the law must also be changed to permit it.
58Heb 7:13 For the priest we are talking about belongs to a different tribe, whose members have never served at the altar as priests.
58Heb 7:14 What I mean is, our Lord came from the tribe of Judah, and Moses never mentioned priests coming from that tribe.
58Heb 7:15 This change has been made very clear since a different priest, who is like Melchizedek, has appeared.
58Heb 7:16 Jesus became a priest, not by meeting the physical requirement of belonging to the tribe of Levi, but by the power of a life that cannot be destroyed.
58Heb 7:17 And the psalmist pointed this out when he prophesied, "You are a priest forever in the order of Melchizedek."�� / ��Ps 110.4
58Heb 7:18 Yes, the old requirement about the priesthood was set aside because it was weak and useless.
58Heb 7:19 For the law never made anything perfect. But now we have confidence in a better hope, through which we draw near to God.
58Heb 7:20 This new system was established with a solemn oath. Aaron's descendants became priests without such an oath,
58Heb 7:21 but there was an oath regarding Jesus. For God said to him, "The LORD has taken an oath and will not break his vow�� 'You are a priest forever.'"�� / ��Ps 110.4
58Heb 7:22 Because of this oath, Jesus is the one who guarantees this better covenant with God.
58Heb 7:23 There were many priests under the old system, for death prevented them from remaining in office.
58Heb 7:24 But because Jesus lives forever, his priesthood lasts forever.
58Heb 7:25 Therefore he is able, once and forever, to save�� those who come to God through him. He lives forever to intercede with God on their behalf. / ��Or is able to save completely
58Heb 7:26 He is the kind of high priest we need because he is holy and blameless, unstained by sin. He has been set apart from sinners and has been given the highest place of honor in heaven��. / ��Or has been exalted higher than the heavens
58Heb 7:27 Unlike those other high priests, he does not need to offer sacrifices every day. They did this for their own sins first and then for the sins of the people. But Jesus did this once for all when he offered himself as the sacrifice for the people's sins.
58Heb 7:28 The law appointed high priests who were limited by human weakness. But after the law was given, God appointed his Son with an oath, and his Son has been made the perfect High Priest forever.
58Heb 8:1 Here is the main point�� We have a High Priest who sat down in the place of honor beside the throne of the majestic God in heaven.
58Heb 8:2 There he ministers in the heavenly Tabernacle��, the true place of worship that was built by the Lord and not by human hands. / ��Or tent; also in 8.5
58Heb 8:3 And since every high priest is required to offer gifts and sacrifices, our High Priest must make an offering, too.
58Heb 8:4 If he were here on earth, he would not even be a priest, since there already are priests who offer the gifts required by the law.
58Heb 8:5 They serve in a system of worship that is only a copy, a shadow of the real one in heaven. For when Moses was getting ready to build the Tabernacle, God gave him this warning�� "Be sure that you make everything according to the pattern I have shown you here on the mountain."�� / ��Exod 25.40; 26.30
58Heb 8:6 But now Jesus, our High Priest, has been given a ministry that is far superior to the old priesthood, for he is the one who mediates for us a far better covenant with God, based on better promises.
58Heb 8:7 If the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need for a second covenant to replace it.
58Heb 8:8 But when God found fault with the people, he said�� "The day is coming, says the LORD, when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah.
58Heb 8:9 This covenant will not be like the one I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and led them out of the land of Egypt. They did not remain faithful to my covenant, so I turned my back on them, says the LORD.
58Heb 8:10 But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel on that day��, says the LORD�� I will put my laws in their minds, and I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. / ��Greek after those days
58Heb 8:11 And they will not need to teach their neighbors, nor will they need to teach their relatives��, saying, 'You should know the LORD.' For everyone, from the least to the greatest, will know me already. / ��Greek their brother
58Heb 8:12 And I will forgive their wickedness, and I will never again remember their sins."�� / ��Jer 31.31-34
58Heb 8:13 When God speaks of a "new" covenant, it means he has made the first one obsolete. It is now out of date and will soon disappear.
58Heb 9:1 That first covenant between God and Israel had regulations for worship and a place of worship here on earth.
58Heb 9:2 There were two rooms in that Tabernacle��. In the first room were a lampstand, a table, and sacred loaves of bread on the table. This room was called the Holy Place. / ��Or tent; also in 9.11, 21
58Heb 9:3 Then there was a curtain, and behind the curtain was the second room�� called the Most Holy Place. / ��Greek second tent
58Heb 9:4 In that room were a gold incense altar and a wooden chest called the Ark of the Covenant, which was covered with gold on all sides. Inside the Ark were a gold jar containing manna, Aaron's staff that sprouted leaves, and the stone tablets of the covenant.
58Heb 9:5 Above the Ark were the cherubim of divine glory, whose wings stretched out over the Ark's cover, the place of atonement. But we cannot explain these things in detail now.
58Heb 9:6 When these things were all in place, the priests regularly entered the first room�� as they performed their religious duties. / ��Greek first tent
58Heb 9:7 But only the high priest ever entered the Most Holy Place, and only once a year. And he always offered blood for his own sins and for the sins the people had committed in ignorance.
58Heb 9:8 By these regulations the Holy Spirit revealed that the entrance to the Most Holy Place was not freely open as long as the Tabernacle�� and the system it represented were still in use. / ��Or the first room; Greek reads the first tent
58Heb 9:9 This is an illustration pointing to the present time. For the gifts and sacrifices that the priests offer are not able to cleanse the consciences of the people who bring them.
58Heb 9:10 For that old system deals only with food and drink and various cleansing ceremonies - physical regulations that were in effect only until a better system could be established.
58Heb 9:11 So Christ has now become the High Priest over all the good things that have come��. He has entered that greater, more perfect Tabernacle in heaven, which was not made by human hands and is not part of this created world. / ��Some manuscripts read that are about to come
58Heb 9:12 With his own blood - not the blood of goats and calves - he entered the Most Holy Place once for all time and secured our redemption forever.
58Heb 9:13 Under the old system, the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a young cow could cleanse people's bodies from ceremonial impurity.
58Heb 9:14 Just think how much more the blood of Christ will purify our consciences from sinful deeds�� so that we can worship the living God. For by the power of the eternal Spirit, Christ offered himself to God as a perfect sacrifice for our sins. / ��Greek from dead works
58Heb 9:15 That is why he is the one who mediates a new covenant between God and people, so that all who are called can receive the eternal inheritance God has promised them. For Christ died to set them free from the penalty of the sins they had committed under that first covenant.
58Heb 9:16 Now when someone leaves a will��, it is necessary to prove that the person who made it is dead��. / ��Or covenant; also in 9.17 ��Or Now when someone makes a covenant, it is necessary to ratify it with the death of a sacrifice
58Heb 9:17 The will goes into effect only after the person's death. While the person who made it is still alive, the will cannot be put into effect.
58Heb 9:18 That is why even the first covenant was put into effect with the blood of an animal.
58Heb 9:19 For after Moses had read each of God's commandments to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats��, along with water, and sprinkled both the book of God's law and all the people, using hyssop branches and scarlet wool. / ��Some manuscripts do not include and goats
58Heb 9:20 Then he said, "This blood confirms the covenant God has made with you."�� / ��Exod 24.8
58Heb 9:21 And in the same way, he sprinkled blood on the Tabernacle and on everything used for worship.
58Heb 9:22 In fact, according to the law of Moses, nearly everything was purified with blood. For without the shedding of blood, there is no forgiveness.
58Heb 9:23 That is why the Tabernacle and everything in it, which were copies of things in heaven, had to be purified by the blood of animals. But the real things in heaven had to be purified with far better sacrifices than the blood of animals.
58Heb 9:24 For Christ did not enter into a holy place made with human hands, which was only a copy of the true one in heaven. He entered into heaven itself to appear now before God on our behalf.
58Heb 9:25 And he did not enter heaven to offer himself again and again, like the high priest here on earth who enters the Most Holy Place year after year with the blood of an animal.
58Heb 9:26 If that had been necessary, Christ would have had to die again and again, ever since the world began. But now, once for all time, he has appeared at the end of the age�� to remove sin by his own death as a sacrifice. / ��Greek the ages
58Heb 9:27 And just as each person is destined to die once and after that comes judgment,
58Heb 9:28 so also Christ died once for all time as a sacrifice to take away the sins of many people. He will come again, not to deal with our sins, but to bring salvation to all who are eagerly waiting for him.
58Heb 10:1 The old system under the law of Moses was only a shadow, a dim preview of the good things to come, not the good things themselves. The sacrifices under that system were repeated again and again, year after year, but they were never able to provide perfect cleansing for those who came to worship.
58Heb 10:2 If they could have provided perfect cleansing, the sacrifices would have stopped, for the worshipers would have been purified once for all time, and their feelings of guilt would have disappeared.
58Heb 10:3 But instead, those sacrifices actually reminded them of their sins year after year.
58Heb 10:4 For it is not possible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
58Heb 10:5 That is why, when Christ�� came into the world, he said to God, "You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings. But you have given me a body to offer. / ��Greek he; also in 10.8
58Heb 10:6 You were not pleased with burnt offerings or other offerings for sin.
58Heb 10:7 Then I said, 'Look, I have come to do your will, O God - as is written about me in the Scriptures.'"�� / ��Ps 40.6-8 (Greek version)
58Heb 10:8 First, Christ said, "You did not want animal sacrifices or sin offerings or burnt offerings or other offerings for sin, nor were you pleased with them" (though they are required by the law of Moses).
58Heb 10:9 Then he said, "Look, I have come to do your will." He cancels the first covenant in order to put the second into effect.
58Heb 10:10 For God's will was for us to be made holy by the sacrifice of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all time.
58Heb 10:11 Under the old covenant, the priest stands and ministers before the altar day after day, offering the same sacrifices again and again, which can never take away sins.
58Heb 10:12 But our High Priest offered himself to God as a single sacrifice for sins, good for all time. Then he sat down in the place of honor at God's right hand.
58Heb 10:13 There he waits until his enemies are humbled and made a footstool under his feet.
58Heb 10:14 For by that one offering he forever made perfect those who are being made holy.
58Heb 10:15 And the Holy Spirit also testifies that this is so. For he says,
58Heb 10:16 "This is the new covenant I will make with my people on that day��, says the LORD�� I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds."�� / ��Greek after those days ��Jer 31.33a
58Heb 10:17 Then he says, "I will never again remember their sins and lawless deeds."�� / ��Jer 31.34b
58Heb 10:18 And when sins have been forgiven, there is no need to offer any more sacrifices.
58Heb 10:19 And so, dear brothers and sisters��, we can boldly enter heaven's Most Holy Place because of the blood of Jesus. / ��Greek brothers
58Heb 10:20 By his death��, Jesus opened a new and life-giving way through the curtain into the Most Holy Place. / ��Greek Through his flesh
58Heb 10:21 And since we have a great High Priest who rules over God's house,
58Heb 10:22 let us go right into the presence of God with sincere hearts fully trusting him. For our guilty consciences have been sprinkled with Christ's blood to make us clean, and our bodies have been washed with pure water.
58Heb 10:23 Let us hold tightly without wavering to the hope we affirm, for God can be trusted to keep his promise.
58Heb 10:24 Let us think of ways to motivate one another to acts of love and good works.
58Heb 10:25 And let us not neglect our meeting together, as some people do, but encourage one another, especially now that the day of his return is drawing near.
58Heb 10:26 Dear friends, if we deliberately continue sinning after we have received knowledge of the truth, there is no longer any sacrifice that will cover these sins.
58Heb 10:27 There is only the terrible expectation of God's judgment and the raging fire that will consume his enemies.
58Heb 10:28 For anyone who refused to obey the law of Moses was put to death without mercy on the testimony of two or three witnesses.
58Heb 10:29 Just think how much worse the punishment will be for those who have trampled on the Son of God, and have treated the blood of the covenant, which made us holy, as if it were common and unholy, and have insulted and disdained the Holy Spirit who brings God's mercy to us.
58Heb 10:30 For we know the one who said, "I will take revenge. I will pay them back."�� He also said, "The LORD will judge his own people."�� / ��Deut 32.35 ��Deut 32.36
58Heb 10:31 It is a terrible thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
58Heb 10:32 Think back on those early days when you first learned about Christ��. Remember how you remained faithful even though it meant terrible suffering. / ��Greek when you were first enlightened
58Heb 10:33 Sometimes you were exposed to public ridicule and were beaten, and sometimes you helped others who were suffering the same things.
58Heb 10:34 You suffered along with those who were thrown into jail, and when all you owned was taken from you, you accepted it with joy. You knew there were better things waiting for you that will last forever.
58Heb 10:35 So do not throw away this confident trust in the Lord. Remember the great reward it brings you!
58Heb 10:36 Patient endurance is what you need now, so that you will continue to do God's will. Then you will receive all that he has promised.
58Heb 10:37 "For in just a little while, the Coming One will come and not delay.
58Heb 10:38 And my righteous ones will live by faith��. But I will take no pleasure in anyone who turns away."�� / ��Or my righteous ones will live by their faithfulness; Greek reads my righteous one will live by faith. ��Hab 2.3-4
58Heb 10:39 But we are not like those who turn away from God to their own destruction. We are the faithful ones, whose souls will be saved.
58Heb 11:1 Faith is the confidence that what we hope for will actually happen; it gives us assurance about things we cannot see.
58Heb 11:2 Through their faith, the people in days of old earned a good reputation.
58Heb 11:3 By faith we understand that the entire universe was formed at God's command, that what we now see did not come from anything that can be seen.
58Heb 11:4 It was by faith that Abel brought a more acceptable offering to God than Cain did. Abel's offering gave evidence that he was a righteous man, and God showed his approval of his gifts. Although Abel is long dead, he still speaks to us by his example of faith.
58Heb 11:5 It was by faith that Enoch was taken up to heaven without dying - "he disappeared, because God took him."�� For before he was taken up, he was known as a person who pleased God. / ��Gen 5.24
58Heb 11:6 And it is impossible to please God without faith. Anyone who wants to come to him must believe that God exists and that he rewards those who sincerely seek him.
58Heb 11:7 It was by faith that Noah built a large boat to save his family from the flood. He obeyed God, who warned him about things that had never happened before. By his faith Noah condemned the rest of the world, and he received the righteousness that comes by faith.
58Heb 11:8 It was by faith that Abraham obeyed when God called him to leave home and go to another land that God would give him as his inheritance. He went without knowing where he was going.
58Heb 11:9 And even when he reached the land God promised him, he lived there by faith - for he was like a foreigner, living in tents. And so did Isaac and Jacob, who inherited the same promise.
58Heb 11:10 Abraham was confidently looking forward to a city with eternal foundations, a city designed and built by God.
58Heb 11:11 It was by faith that even Sarah was able to have a child, though she was barren and was too old. She believed�� that God would keep his promise. / ��Or It was by faith that he [Abraham] was able to have a child, even though Sarah was barren and he was too old. He believed
58Heb 11:12 And so a whole nation came from this one man who was as good as dead - a nation with so many people that, like the stars in the sky and the sand on the seashore, there is no way to count them.
58Heb 11:13 All these people died still believing what God had promised them. They did not receive what was promised, but they saw it all from a distance and welcomed it. They agreed that they were foreigners and nomads here on earth.
58Heb 11:14 Obviously people who say such things are looking forward to a country they can call their own.
58Heb 11:15 If they had longed for the country they came from, they could have gone back.
58Heb 11:16 But they were looking for a better place, a heavenly homeland. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared a city for them.
58Heb 11:17 It was by faith that Abraham offered Isaac as a sacrifice when God was testing him. Abraham, who had received God's promises, was ready to sacrifice his only son, Isaac,
58Heb 11:18 even though God had told him, "Isaac is the son through whom your descendants will be counted."�� / ��Gen 21.12
58Heb 11:19 Abraham reasoned that if Isaac died, God was able to bring him back to life again. And in a sense, Abraham did receive his son back from the dead.
58Heb 11:20 It was by faith that Isaac promised blessings for the future to his sons, Jacob and Esau.
58Heb 11:21 It was by faith that Jacob, when he was old and dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons and bowed in worship as he leaned on his staff.
58Heb 11:22 It was by faith that Joseph, when he was about to die, said confidently that the people of Israel would leave Egypt. He even commanded them to take his bones with them when they left.
58Heb 11:23 It was by faith that Moses' parents hid him for three months when he was born. They saw that God had given them an unusual child, and they were not afraid to disobey the king's command.
58Heb 11:24 It was by faith that Moses, when he grew up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter.
58Heb 11:25 He chose to share the oppression of God's people instead of enjoying the fleeting pleasures of sin.
58Heb 11:26 He thought it was better to suffer for the sake of Christ than to own the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking ahead to his great reward.
58Heb 11:27 It was by faith that Moses left the land of Egypt, not fearing the king's anger. He kept right on going because he kept his eyes on the one who is invisible.
58Heb 11:28 It was by faith that Moses commanded the people of Israel to keep the Passover and to sprinkle blood on the doorposts so that the angel of death would not kill their firstborn sons.
58Heb 11:29 It was by faith that the people of Israel went right through the Red Sea as though they were on dry ground. But when the Egyptians tried to follow, they were all drowned.
58Heb 11:30 It was by faith that the people of Israel marched around Jericho for seven days, and the walls came crashing down.
58Heb 11:31 It was by faith that Rahab the prostitute was not destroyed with the people in her city who refused to obey God. For she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.
58Heb 11:32 How much more do I need to say? It would take too long to recount the stories of the faith of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and all the prophets.
58Heb 11:33 By faith these people overthrew kingdoms, ruled with justice, and received what God had promised them. They shut the mouths of lions,
58Heb 11:34 quenched the flames of fire, and escaped death by the edge of the sword. Their weakness was turned to strength. They became strong in battle and put whole armies to flight.
58Heb 11:35 Women received their loved ones back again from death. But others were tortured, refusing to turn from God in order to be set free. They placed their hope in a better life after the resurrection.
58Heb 11:36 Some were jeered at, and their backs were cut open with whips. Others were chained in prisons.
58Heb 11:37 Some died by stoning, some were sawed in half��, and others were killed with the sword. Some went about wearing skins of sheep and goats, destitute and oppressed and mistreated. / ��Some manuscripts add some were tested
58Heb 11:38 They were too good for this world, wandering over deserts and mountains, hiding in caves and holes in the ground.
58Heb 11:39 All these people earned a good reputation because of their faith, yet none of them received all that God had promised.
58Heb 11:40 For God had something better in mind for us, so that they would not reach perfection without us.
58Heb 12:1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by such a huge crowd of witnesses to the life of faith, let us strip off every weight that slows us down, especially the sin that so easily trips us up. And let us run with endurance the race God has set before us.
58Heb 12:2 We do this by keeping our eyes on Jesus, the champion who initiates and perfects our faith��. Because of the joy�� awaiting him, he endured the cross, disregarding its shame. Now he is seated in the place of honor beside God's throne. / ��Or Jesus, the originator and perfecter of our faith ��Or Instead of the joy
58Heb 12:3 Think of all the hostility he endured from sinful people��; then you won't become weary and give up. / ��Some manuscripts read Think of how people hurt themselves by opposing him
58Heb 12:4 After all, you have not yet given your lives in your struggle against sin.
58Heb 12:5 And have you forgotten the encouraging words God spoke to you as his children��? He said, "My child��, don't make light of the LORD's discipline, and don't give up when he corrects you. / ��Greek sons; also in 12.7, 8 ��Greek son; also in 12.6, 7
58Heb 12:6 For the LORD disciplines those he loves, and he punishes each one he accepts as his child."�� / ��Prov 3.11-12 (Greek version)
58Heb 12:7 As you endure this divine discipline, remember that God is treating you as his own children. Who ever heard of a child who is never disciplined by its father?
58Heb 12:8 If God doesn't discipline you as he does all of his children, it means that you are illegitimate and are not really his children at all.
58Heb 12:9 Since we respected our earthly fathers who disciplined us, shouldn't we submit even more to the discipline of the Father of our spirits, and live forever��? / ��Or and really live
58Heb 12:10 For our earthly fathers disciplined us for a few years, doing the best they knew how. But God's discipline is always good for us, so that we might share in his holiness.
58Heb 12:11 No discipline is enjoyable while it is happening - it's painful! But afterward there will be a peaceful harvest of right living for those who are trained in this way.
58Heb 12:12 So take a new grip with your tired hands and strengthen your weak knees.
58Heb 12:13 Mark out a straight path for your feet so that those who are weak and lame will not fall but become strong.
58Heb 12:14 Work at living in peace with everyone, and work at living a holy life, for those who are not holy will not see the Lord.
58Heb 12:15 Look after each other so that none of you fails to receive the grace of God. Watch out that no poisonous root of bitterness grows up to trouble you, corrupting many.
58Heb 12:16 Make sure that no one is immoral or godless like Esau, who traded his birthright as the firstborn son for a single meal.
58Heb 12:17 You know that afterward, when he wanted his father's blessing, he was rejected. It was too late for repentance, even though he begged with bitter tears.
58Heb 12:18 You have not come to a physical mountain��, to a place of flaming fire, darkness, gloom, and whirlwind, as the Israelites did at Mount Sinai. / ��Greek to something that can be touched
58Heb 12:19 For they heard an awesome trumpet blast and a voice so terrible that they begged God to stop speaking.
58Heb 12:20 They staggered back under God's command�� "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death."�� / ��Exod 19.13
58Heb 12:21 Moses himself was so frightened at the sight that he said, "I am terrified and trembling."�� / ��Deut 9.19
58Heb 12:22 No, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to countless thousands of angels in a joyful gathering.
58Heb 12:23 You have come to the assembly of God's firstborn children, whose names are written in heaven. You have come to God himself, who is the judge over all things. You have come to the spirits of the righteous ones in heaven who have now been made perfect.
58Heb 12:24 You have come to Jesus, the one who mediates the new covenant between God and people, and to the sprinkled blood, which speaks of forgiveness instead of crying out for vengeance like the blood of Abel.
58Heb 12:25 Be careful that you do not refuse to listen to the One who is speaking. For if the people of Israel did not escape when they refused to listen to Moses, the earthly messenger, we will certainly not escape if we reject the One who speaks to us from heaven!
58Heb 12:26 When God spoke from Mount Sinai his voice shook the earth, but now he makes another promise�� "Once again I will shake not only the earth but the heavens also."�� / ��Hag 2.6
58Heb 12:27 This means that all of creation will be shaken and removed, so that only unshakable things will remain.
58Heb 12:28 Since we are receiving a Kingdom that is unshakable, let us be thankful and please God by worshiping him with holy fear and awe.
58Heb 12:29 For our God is a devouring fire.
58Heb 13:1 Keep on loving each other as brothers and sisters��. / ��Greek Continue in brotherly love
58Heb 13:2 Don't forget to show hospitality to strangers, for some who have done this have entertained angels without realizing it!
58Heb 13:3 Remember those in prison, as if you were there yourself. Remember also those being mistreated, as if you felt their pain in your own bodies.
58Heb 13:4 Give honor to marriage, and remain faithful to one another in marriage. God will surely judge people who are immoral and those who commit adultery.
58Heb 13:5 Don't love money; be satisfied with what you have. For God has said, "I will never fail you. I will never abandon you."�� / ��Deut 31.6, 8
58Heb 13:6 So we can say with confidence, "The LORD is my helper, so I will have no fear. What can mere people do to me?"�� / ��Ps 118.6
58Heb 13:7 Remember your leaders who taught you the word of God. Think of all the good that has come from their lives, and follow the example of their faith.
58Heb 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
58Heb 13:9 So do not be attracted by strange, new ideas. Your strength comes from God's grace, not from rules about food, which don't help those who follow them.
58Heb 13:10 We have an altar from which the priests in the Tabernacle�� have no right to eat. / ��Or tent
58Heb 13:11 Under the old system, the high priest brought the blood of animals into the Holy Place as a sacrifice for sin, and the bodies of the animals were burned outside the camp.
58Heb 13:12 So also Jesus suffered and died outside the city gates to make his people holy by means of his own blood.
58Heb 13:13 So let us go out to him, outside the camp, and bear the disgrace he bore.
58Heb 13:14 For this world is not our permanent home; we are looking forward to a home yet to come.
58Heb 13:15 Therefore, let us offer through Jesus a continual sacrifice of praise to God, proclaiming our allegiance to his name.
58Heb 13:16 And don't forget to do good and to share with those in need. These are the sacrifices that please God.
58Heb 13:17 Obey your spiritual leaders, and do what they say. Their work is to watch over your souls, and they are accountable to God. Give them reason to do this with joy and not with sorrow. That would certainly not be for your benefit.
58Heb 13:18 Pray for us, for our conscience is clear and we want to live honorably in everything we do.
58Heb 13:19 And especially pray that I will be able to come back to you soon.
58Heb 13:20 Now may the God of peace - who brought up from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great Shepherd of the sheep, and ratified an eternal covenant with his blood - 
58Heb 13:21 may he equip you with all you need for doing his will. May he produce in you��, through the power of Jesus Christ, every good thing that is pleasing to him. All glory to him forever and ever! Amen. / ��Some manuscripts read in us

59Jms 1:1 This letter is from James, a slave of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ. I am writing to the "twelve tribes" - Jewish believers scattered abroad. Greetings!
59Jms 1:2 Dear brothers and sisters��, when troubles come your way, consider it an opportunity for great joy. / ��Greek brothers; also in 1.16, 19
59Jms 1:3 For you know that when your faith is tested, your endurance has a chance to grow.
59Jms 1:4 So let it grow, for when your endurance is fully developed, you will be perfect and complete, needing nothing.
59Jms 1:5 If you need wisdom, ask our generous God, and he will give it to you. He will not rebuke you for asking.
59Jms 1:6 But when you ask him, be sure that your faith is in God alone. Do not waver, for a person with divided loyalty is as unsettled as a wave of the sea that is blown and tossed by the wind.
59Jms 1:7 Such people should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.
59Jms 1:8 Their loyalty is divided between God and the world, and they are unstable in everything they do.
59Jms 1:9 Believers who are�� poor have something to boast about, for God has honored them. / ��Greek The brother who is
59Jms 1:10 And those who are rich should boast that God has humbled them. They will fade away like a little flower in the field.
59Jms 1:11 The hot sun rises and the grass withers; the little flower droops and falls, and its beauty fades away. In the same way, the rich will fade away with all of their achievements.
59Jms 1:12 God blesses those who patiently endure testing and temptation. Afterward they will receive the crown of life that God has promised to those who love him.
59Jms 1:13 And remember, when you are being tempted, do not say, "God is tempting me." God is never tempted to do wrong��, and he never tempts anyone else. / ��Or God should not be put to a test by evil people
59Jms 1:14 Temptation comes from our own desires, which entice us and drag us away.
59Jms 1:15 These desires give birth to sinful actions. And when sin is allowed to grow, it gives birth to death.
59Jms 1:16 So don't be misled, my dear brothers and sisters.
59Jms 1:17 Whatever is good and perfect comes down to us from God our Father, who created all the lights in the heavens��. He never changes or casts a shifting shadow��. / ��Greek from above, from the Father of lights ��Some manuscripts read He never changes, as a shifting shadow does
59Jms 1:18 He chose to give birth to us by giving us his true word. And we, out of all creation, became his prized possession��. / ��Greek we became a kind of firstfruit of his creatures
59Jms 1:19 Understand this, my dear brothers and sisters�� You must all be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry.
59Jms 1:20 Human anger�� does not produce the righteousness�� God desires. / ��Greek A man's anger ��Or the justice
59Jms 1:21 So get rid of all the filth and evil in your lives, and humbly accept the word God has planted in your hearts, for it has the power to save your souls.
59Jms 1:22 But don't just listen to God's word. You must do what it says. Otherwise, you are only fooling yourselves.
59Jms 1:23 For if you listen to the word and don't obey, it is like glancing at your face in a mirror.
59Jms 1:24 You see yourself, walk away, and forget what you look like.
59Jms 1:25 But if you look carefully into the perfect law that sets you free, and if you do what it says and don't forget what you heard, then God will bless you for doing it.
59Jms 1:26 If you claim to be religious but don't control your tongue, you are fooling yourself, and your religion is worthless.
59Jms 1:27 Pure and genuine religion in the sight of God the Father means caring for orphans and widows in their distress and refusing to let the world corrupt you.
59Jms 2:1 My dear brothers and sisters��, how can you claim to have faith in our glorious Lord Jesus Christ if you favor some people over others? / ��Greek brothers; also in 2.5, 14
59Jms 2:2 For example, suppose someone comes into your meeting�� dressed in fancy clothes and expensive jewelry, and another comes in who is poor and dressed in dirty clothes. / ��Greek your synagogue
59Jms 2:3 If you give special attention and a good seat to the rich person, but you say to the poor one, "You can stand over there, or else sit on the floor" - well,
59Jms 2:4 doesn't this discrimination show that your judgments are guided by evil motives?
59Jms 2:5 Listen to me, dear brothers and sisters. Hasn't God chosen the poor in this world to be rich in faith? Aren't they the ones who will inherit the Kingdom he promised to those who love him?
59Jms 2:6 But you dishonor the poor! Isn't it the rich who oppress you and drag you into court?
59Jms 2:7 Aren't they the ones who slander Jesus Christ, whose noble name�� you bear? / ��Greek slander the noble name
59Jms 2:8 Yes indeed, it is good when you obey the royal law as found in the Scriptures�� "Love your neighbor as yourself."�� / ��Lev 19.18
59Jms 2:9 But if you favor some people over others, you are committing a sin. You are guilty of breaking the law.
59Jms 2:10 For the person who keeps all of the laws except one is as guilty as a person who has broken all of God's laws.
59Jms 2:11 For the same God who said, "You must not commit adultery," also said, "You must not murder."�� So if you murder someone but do not commit adultery, you have still broken the law. / ��Exod 20.13-14; Deut 5.17-18
59Jms 2:12 So whatever you say or whatever you do, remember that you will be judged by the law that sets you free.
59Jms 2:13 There will be no mercy for those who have not shown mercy to others. But if you have been merciful, God will be merciful when he judges you.
59Jms 2:14 What good is it, dear brothers and sisters, if you say you have faith but don't show it by your actions? Can that kind of faith save anyone?
59Jms 2:15 Suppose you see a brother or sister who has no food or clothing,
59Jms 2:16 and you say, "Good-bye and have a good day; stay warm and eat well" - but then you don't give that person any food or clothing. What good does that do?
59Jms 2:17 So you see, faith by itself isn't enough. Unless it produces good deeds, it is dead and useless.
59Jms 2:18 Now someone may argue, "Some people have faith; others have good deeds." But I say, "How can you show me your faith if you don't have good deeds? I will show you my faith by my good deeds."
59Jms 2:19 You say you have faith, for you believe that there is one God��. Good for you! Even the demons believe this, and they tremble in terror. / ��Some manuscripts read that God is one; see Deut 6.4
59Jms 2:20 How foolish! Can't you see that faith without good deeds is useless?
59Jms 2:21 Don't you remember that our ancestor Abraham was shown to be right with God by his actions when he offered his son Isaac on the altar?
59Jms 2:22 You see, his faith and his actions worked together. His actions made his faith complete.
59Jms 2:23 And so it happened just as the Scriptures say�� "Abraham believed God, and God counted him as righteous because of his faith."�� He was even called the friend of God��. / ��Gen 15.6 ��See Isa 41.8
59Jms 2:24 So you see, we are shown to be right with God by what we do, not by faith alone.
59Jms 2:25 Rahab the prostitute is another example. She was shown to be right with God by her actions when she hid those messengers and sent them safely away by a different road.
59Jms 2:26 Just as the body is dead without breath��, so also faith is dead without good works. / ��Or without spirit
59Jms 3:1 Dear brothers and sisters��, not many of you should become teachers in the church, for we who teach will be judged more strictly. / ��Greek brothers; also in 3.10
59Jms 3:2 Indeed, we all make many mistakes. For if we could control our tongues, we would be perfect and could also control ourselves in every other way.
59Jms 3:3 We can make a large horse go wherever we want by means of a small bit in its mouth.
59Jms 3:4 And a small rudder makes a huge ship turn wherever the pilot chooses to go, even though the winds are strong.
59Jms 3:5 In the same way, the tongue is a small thing that makes grand speeches. But a tiny spark can set a great forest on fire.
59Jms 3:6 And the tongue is a flame of fire. It is a whole world of wickedness, corrupting your entire body. It can set your whole life on fire, for it is set on fire by hell itself��. / ��Or for it will burn in hell (Greek Gehenna).
59Jms 3:7 People can tame all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and fish,
59Jms 3:8 but no one can tame the tongue. It is restless and evil, full of deadly poison.
59Jms 3:9 Sometimes it praises our Lord and Father, and sometimes it curses those who have been made in the image of God.
59Jms 3:10 And so blessing and cursing come pouring out of the same mouth. Surely, my brothers and sisters, this is not right!
59Jms 3:11 Does a spring of water bubble out with both fresh water and bitter water?
59Jms 3:12 Does a fig tree produce olives, or a grapevine produce figs? No, and you can't draw fresh water from a salty spring��. / ��Greek from salt
59Jms 3:13 If you are wise and understand God's ways, prove it by living an honorable life, doing good works with the humility that comes from wisdom.
59Jms 3:14 But if you are bitterly jealous and there is selfish ambition in your heart, don't cover up the truth with boasting and lying.
59Jms 3:15 For jealousy and selfishness are not God's kind of wisdom. Such things are earthly, unspiritual, and demonic.
59Jms 3:16 For wherever there is jealousy and selfish ambition, there you will find disorder and evil of every kind.
59Jms 3:17 But the wisdom from above is first of all pure. It is also peace loving, gentle at all times, and willing to yield to others. It is full of mercy and good deeds. It shows no favoritism and is always sincere.
59Jms 3:18 And those who are peacemakers will plant seeds of peace and reap a harvest of righteousness��. / ��Or of good things, or of justice
59Jms 4:1 What is causing the quarrels and fights among you? Don't they come from the evil desires at war within you?
59Jms 4:2 You want what you don't have, so you scheme and kill to get it. You are jealous of what others have, but you can't get it, so you fight and wage war to take it away from them. Yet you don't have what you want because you don't ask God for it.
59Jms 4:3 And even when you ask, you don't get it because your motives are all wrong - you want only what will give you pleasure.
59Jms 4:4 You adulterers!�� Don't you realize that friendship with the world makes you an enemy of God? I say it again�� If you want to be a friend of the world, you make yourself an enemy of God. / ��Greek You adulteresses!
59Jms 4:5 What do you think the Scriptures mean when they say that the spirit God has placed within us is filled with envy?�� / ��Or that God longs jealously for the human spirit he has placed within us? or that the Holy Spirit, whom God has placed within us, opposes our envy?
59Jms 4:6 But he gives us even more grace to stand against such evil desires. As the Scriptures say, "God opposes the proud but favors the humble."�� / ��Prov 3.34 (Greek version)
59Jms 4:7 So humble yourselves before God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
59Jms 4:8 Come close to God, and God will come close to you. Wash your hands, you sinners; purify your hearts, for your loyalty is divided between God and the world.
59Jms 4:9 Let there be tears for what you have done. Let there be sorrow and deep grief. Let there be sadness instead of laughter, and gloom instead of joy.
59Jms 4:10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will lift you up in honor.
59Jms 4:11 Don't speak evil against each other, dear brothers and sisters��. If you criticize and judge each other, then you are criticizing and judging God's law. But your job is to obey the law, not to judge whether it applies to you. / ��Greek brothers
59Jms 4:12 God alone, who gave the law, is the Judge. He alone has the power to save or to destroy. So what right do you have to judge your neighbor?
59Jms 4:13 Look here, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we are going to a certain town and will stay there a year. We will do business there and make a profit."
59Jms 4:14 How do you know what your life will be like tomorrow? Your life is like the morning fog - it's here a little while, then it's gone.
59Jms 4:15 What you ought to say is, "If the Lord wants us to, we will live and do this or that."
59Jms 4:16 Otherwise you are boasting about your own plans, and all such boasting is evil.
59Jms 4:17 Remember, it is sin to know what you ought to do and then not do it.
59Jms 5:1 Look here, you rich people�� Weep and groan with anguish because of all the terrible troubles ahead of you.
59Jms 5:2 Your wealth is rotting away, and your fine clothes are moth-eaten rags.
59Jms 5:3 Your gold and silver have become worthless. The very wealth you were counting on will eat away your flesh like fire. This treasure you have accumulated will stand as evidence against you on the day of judgment.
59Jms 5:4 For listen! Hear the cries of the field workers whom you have cheated of their pay. The wages you held back cry out against you. The cries of those who harvest your fields have reached the ears of the L<%=ftSC>ORD of Heaven's Armies.
59Jms 5:5 You have spent your years on earth in luxury, satisfying your every desire. You have fattened yourselves for the day of slaughter.
59Jms 5:6 You have condemned and killed innocent people��, who do not resist you��. / ��Or killed the Righteous One ��Or Don't they resist you? or Doesn't God oppose you? or Aren't they now accusing you before God?
59Jms 5:7 Dear brothers and sisters��, be patient as you wait for the Lord's return. Consider the farmers who patiently wait for the rains in the fall and in the spring. They eagerly look for the valuable harvest to ripen. / ��Greek brothers; also in 5.9, 10, 12, 19
59Jms 5:8 You, too, must be patient. Take courage, for the coming of the Lord is near.
59Jms 5:9 Don't grumble about each other, brothers and sisters, or you will be judged. For look - the Judge is standing at the door!
59Jms 5:10 For examples of patience in suffering, dear brothers and sisters, look at the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
59Jms 5:11 We give great honor to those who endure under suffering. For instance, you know about Job, a man of great endurance. You can see how the Lord was kind to him at the end, for the Lord is full of tenderness and mercy.
59Jms 5:12 But most of all, my brothers and sisters, never take an oath, by heaven or earth or anything else. Just say a simple yes or no, so that you will not sin and be condemned.
59Jms 5:13 Are any of you suffering hardships? You should pray. Are any of you happy? You should sing praises.
59Jms 5:14 Are any of you sick? You should call for the elders of the church to come and pray over you, anointing you with oil in the name of the Lord.
59Jms 5:15 Such a prayer offered in faith will heal the sick, and the Lord will make you well. And if you have committed any sins, you will be forgiven.
59Jms 5:16 Confess your sins to each other and pray for each other so that you may be healed. The earnest prayer of a righteous person has great power and produces wonderful results.
59Jms 5:17 Elijah was as human as we are, and yet when he prayed earnestly that no rain would fall, none fell for three and a half years!
59Jms 5:18 Then, when he prayed again, the sky sent down rain and the earth began to yield its crops.
59Jms 5:19 My dear brothers and sisters, if someone among you wanders away from the truth and is brought back,
59Jms 5:20 you can be sure that whoever brings the sinner back will save that person from death and bring about the forgiveness of many sins.

601Pt 1:1 This letter is from Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ. I am writing to God's chosen people who are living as foreigners in the provinces of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia��. / ��Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia were Roman provinces in what is now Turkey
601Pt 1:2 God the Father knew you and chose you long ago, and his Spirit has made you holy. As a result, you have obeyed him and have been cleansed by the blood of Jesus Christ. May God give you more and more grace and peace.
601Pt 1:3 All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. It is by his great mercy that we have been born again, because God raised Jesus Christ from the dead. Now we live with great expectation,
601Pt 1:4 and we have a priceless inheritance - an inheritance that is kept in heaven for you, pure and undefiled, beyond the reach of change and decay.
601Pt 1:5 And through your faith, God is protecting you by his power until you receive this salvation, which is ready to be revealed on the last day for all to see.
601Pt 1:6 So be truly glad��. There is wonderful joy ahead, even though you have to endure many trials for a little while. / ��Or So you are truly glad
601Pt 1:7 These trials will show that your faith is genuine. It is being tested as fire tests and purifies gold - though your faith is far more precious than mere gold. So when your faith remains strong through many trials, it will bring you much praise and glory and honor on the day when Jesus Christ is revealed to the whole world.
601Pt 1:8 You love him even though you have never seen him. Though you do not see him now, you trust him; and you rejoice with a glorious, inexpressible joy.
601Pt 1:9 The reward for trusting him will be the salvation of your souls.
601Pt 1:10 This salvation was something even the prophets wanted to know more about when they prophesied about this gracious salvation prepared for you.
601Pt 1:11 They wondered what time or situation the Spirit of Christ within them was talking about when he told them in advance about Christ's suffering and his great glory afterward.
601Pt 1:12 They were told that their messages were not for themselves, but for you. And now this Good News has been announced to you by those who preached in the power of the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. It is all so wonderful that even the angels are eagerly watching these things happen.
601Pt 1:13 So think clearly and exercise self-control. Look forward to the gracious salvation that will come to you when Jesus Christ is revealed to the world.
601Pt 1:14 So you must live as God's obedient children. Don't slip back into your old ways of living to satisfy your own desires. You didn't know any better then.
601Pt 1:15 But now you must be holy in everything you do, just as God who chose you is holy.
601Pt 1:16 For the Scriptures say, "You must be holy because I am holy."�� / ��Lev 11.44-45; 19.2; 20.7
601Pt 1:17 And remember that the heavenly Father to whom you pray has no favorites. He will judge or reward you according to what you do. So you must live in reverent fear of him during your time as "foreigners in the land."
601Pt 1:18 For you know that God paid a ransom to save you from the empty life you inherited from your ancestors. And the ransom he paid was not mere gold or silver.
601Pt 1:19 It was the precious blood of Christ, the sinless, spotless Lamb of God.
601Pt 1:20 God chose him as your ransom long before the world began, but he has now revealed him to you in these last days.
601Pt 1:21 Through Christ you have come to trust in God. And you have placed your faith and hope in God because he raised Christ from the dead and gave him great glory.
601Pt 1:22 You were cleansed from your sins when you obeyed the truth, so now you must show sincere love to each other as brothers and sisters��. Love each other deeply with all your heart��. / ��Greek must have brotherly love ��Some manuscripts read with a pure heart
601Pt 1:23 For you have been born again, but not to a life that will quickly end. Your new life will last forever because it comes from the eternal, living word of God.
601Pt 1:24 As the Scriptures say, "People are like grass; their beauty is like a flower in the field. The grass withers and the flower fades.
601Pt 1:25 But the word of the Lord remains forever."�� And that word is the Good News that was preached to you. / ��Isa 40.6-8
601Pt 2:1 So get rid of all evil behavior. Be done with all deceit, hypocrisy, jealousy, and all unkind speech.
601Pt 2:2 Like newborn babies, you must crave pure spiritual milk so that you will grow into a full experience of salvation. Cry out for this nourishment,
601Pt 2:3 now that you have had a taste of the Lord's kindness.
601Pt 2:4 You are coming to Christ, who is the living cornerstone of God's temple. He was rejected by people, but he was chosen by God for great honor.
601Pt 2:5 And you are living stones that God is building into his spiritual temple. What's more, you are his holy priests��. Through the mediation of Jesus Christ, you offer spiritual sacrifices that please God. / ��Greek holy priesthood
601Pt 2:6 As the Scriptures say, "I am placing a cornerstone in Jerusalem��, chosen for great honor, and anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced."�� / ��Greek in Zion ��Isa 28.16 (Greek version)
601Pt 2:7 Yes, you who trust him recognize the honor God has given him. But for those who reject him, "The stone that the builders rejected has now become the cornerstone."�� / ��Ps 118.22
601Pt 2:8 And, "He is the stone that makes people stumble, the rock that makes them fall."�� They stumble because they do not obey God's word, and so they meet the fate that was planned for them. / ��Isa 8.14
601Pt 2:9 But you are not like that, for you are a chosen people. You are royal priests��, a holy nation, God's very own possession. As a result, you can show others the goodness of God, for he called you out of the darkness into his wonderful light. / ��Greek a royal priesthood
601Pt 2:10 "Once you had no identity as a people; now you are God's people. Once you received no mercy; now you have received God's mercy."�� / ��Hos 1.6, 9; 2.23
601Pt 2:11 Dear friends, I warn you as "temporary residents and foreigners" to keep away from worldly desires that wage war against your very souls.
601Pt 2:12 Be careful to live properly among your unbelieving neighbors. Then even if they accuse you of doing wrong, they will see your honorable behavior, and they will give honor to God when he judges the world��. / ��Or on the day of visitation
601Pt 2:13 For the Lord's sake, respect all human authority - whether the king as head of state,
601Pt 2:14 or the officials he has appointed. For the king has sent them to punish those who do wrong and to honor those who do right.
601Pt 2:15 It is God's will that your honorable lives should silence those ignorant people who make foolish accusations against you.
601Pt 2:16 For you are free, yet you are God's slaves, so don't use your freedom as an excuse to do evil.
601Pt 2:17 Respect everyone, and love your Christian brothers and sisters��. Fear God, and respect the king. / ��Greek love the brotherhood
601Pt 2:18 You who are slaves must accept the authority of your masters with all respect��. Do what they tell you - not only if they are kind and reasonable, but even if they are cruel. / ��Or because you fear God
601Pt 2:19 For God is pleased with you when you do what you know is right and patiently endure unfair treatment.
601Pt 2:20 Of course, you get no credit for being patient if you are beaten for doing wrong. But if you suffer for doing good and endure it patiently, God is pleased with you.
601Pt 2:21 For God called you to do good, even if it means suffering, just as Christ suffered�� for you. He is your example, and you must follow in his steps. / ��Some manuscripts read died
601Pt 2:22 He never sinned, nor ever deceived anyone.�� / ��Isa 53.9
601Pt 2:23 He did not retaliate when he was insulted, nor threaten revenge when he suffered. He left his case in the hands of God, who always judges fairly.
601Pt 2:24 He personally carried our sins in his body on the cross so that we can be dead to sin and live for what is right. By his wounds you are healed.
601Pt 2:25 Once you were like sheep who wandered away. But now you have turned to your Shepherd, the Guardian of your souls.
601Pt 3:1 In the same way, you wives must accept the authority of your husbands. Then, even if some refuse to obey the Good News, your godly lives will speak to them without any words. They will be won over
601Pt 3:2 by observing your pure and reverent lives.
601Pt 3:3 Don't be concerned about the outward beauty of fancy hairstyles, expensive jewelry, or beautiful clothes.
601Pt 3:4 You should clothe yourselves instead with the beauty that comes from within, the unfading beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is so precious to God.
601Pt 3:5 This is how the holy women of old made themselves beautiful. They trusted God and accepted the authority of their husbands.
601Pt 3:6 For instance, Sarah obeyed her husband, Abraham, and called him her master. You are her daughters when you do what is right without fear of what your husbands might do.
601Pt 3:7 In the same way, you husbands must give honor to your wives. Treat your wife with understanding as you live together. She may be weaker than you are, but she is your equal partner in God's gift of new life. Treat her as you should so your prayers will not be hindered.
601Pt 3:8 Finally, all of you should be of one mind. Sympathize with each other. Love each other as brothers and sisters��. Be tenderhearted, and keep a humble attitude. / ��Greek Show brotherly love
601Pt 3:9 Don't repay evil for evil. Don't retaliate with insults when people insult you. Instead, pay them back with a blessing. That is what God has called you to do, and he will bless you for it.
601Pt 3:10 For the Scriptures say, "If you want to enjoy life and see many happy days, keep your tongue from speaking evil and your lips from telling lies.
601Pt 3:11 Turn away from evil and do good. Search for peace, and work to maintain it.
601Pt 3:12 The eyes of the Lord watch over those who do right, and his ears are open to their prayers. But the Lord turns his face against those who do evil."�� / ��Ps 34.12-16
601Pt 3:13 Now, who will want to harm you if you are eager to do good?
601Pt 3:14 But even if you suffer for doing what is right, God will reward you for it. So don't worry or be afraid of their threats.
601Pt 3:15 Instead, you must worship Christ as Lord of your life. And if someone asks about your Christian hope, always be ready to explain it.
601Pt 3:16 But do this in a gentle and respectful way��. Keep your conscience clear. Then if people speak against you, they will be ashamed when they see what a good life you live because you belong to Christ. / ��Some English translations put this sentence in verse 15
601Pt 3:17 Remember, it is better to suffer for doing good, if that is what God wants, than to suffer for doing wrong!
601Pt 3:18 Christ suffered�� for our sins once for all time. He never sinned, but he died for sinners to bring you safely home to God. He suffered physical death, but he was raised to life in the Spirit��. / ��Some manuscripts read died ��Or in spirit
601Pt 3:19 So he went and preached to the spirits in prison - 
601Pt 3:20 those who disobeyed God long ago when God waited patiently while Noah was building his boat. Only eight people were saved from drowning in that terrible flood��. / ��Greek saved through water
601Pt 3:21 And that water is a picture of baptism, which now saves you, not by removing dirt from your body, but as a response to God from�� a clean conscience. It is effective because of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. / ��Or as an appeal to God for
601Pt 3:22 Now Christ has gone to heaven. He is seated in the place of honor next to God, and all the angels and authorities and powers accept his authority.
601Pt 4:1 So then, since Christ suffered physical pain, you must arm yourselves with the same attitude he had, and be ready to suffer, too. For if you have suffered physically for Christ, you have finished with sin��. / ��Or For the one [or One] who has suffered physically has finished with sin
601Pt 4:2 You won't spend the rest of your lives chasing your own desires, but you will be anxious to do the will of God.
601Pt 4:3 You have had enough in the past of the evil things that godless people enjoy - their immorality and lust, their feasting and drunkenness and wild parties, and their terrible worship of idols.
601Pt 4:4 Of course, your former friends are surprised when you no longer plunge into the flood of wild and destructive things they do. So they slander you.
601Pt 4:5 But remember that they will have to face God, who will judge everyone, both the living and the dead.
601Pt 4:6 That is why the Good News was preached to those who are now dead�� - so although they were destined to die like all people��, they now live forever with God in the Spirit��. / ��Greek preached even to the dead ��Or so although people had judged them worthy of death ��Or in spirit
601Pt 4:7 The end of the world is coming soon. Therefore, be earnest and disciplined in your prayers.
601Pt 4:8 Most important of all, continue to show deep love for each other, for love covers a multitude of sins.
601Pt 4:9 Cheerfully share your home with those who need a meal or a place to stay.
601Pt 4:10 God has given each of you a gift from his great variety of spiritual gifts. Use them well to serve one another.
601Pt 4:11 Do you have the gift of speaking? Then speak as though God himself were speaking through you. Do you have the gift of helping others? Do it with all the strength and energy that God supplies. Then everything you do will bring glory to God through Jesus Christ. All glory and power to him forever and ever! Amen.
601Pt 4:12 Dear friends, don't be surprised at the fiery trials you are going through, as if something strange were happening to you.
601Pt 4:13 Instead, be very glad - for these trials make you partners with Christ in his suffering, so that you will have the wonderful joy of seeing his glory when it is revealed to all the world.
601Pt 4:14 So be happy when you are insulted for being a Christian��, for then the glorious Spirit of God�� rests upon you��. / ��Greek for the name of Christ ��Or for the glory of God, which is his Spirit ��Some manuscripts add On their part he is blasphemed, but on your part he is glorified
601Pt 4:15 If you suffer, however, it must not be for murder, stealing, making trouble, or prying into other people's affairs.
601Pt 4:16 But it is no shame to suffer for being a Christian. Praise God for the privilege of being called by his name!
601Pt 4:17 For the time has come for judgment, and it must begin with God's household. And if judgment begins with us, what terrible fate awaits those who have never obeyed God's Good News?
601Pt 4:18 And also, "If the righteous are barely saved, what will happen to godless sinners?"�� / ��Prov 11.31 (Greek version)
601Pt 4:19 So if you are suffering in a manner that pleases God, keep on doing what is right, and trust your lives to the God who created you, for he will never fail you.
601Pt 5:1 And now, a word to you who are elders in the churches. I, too, am an elder and a witness to the sufferings of Christ. And I, too, will share in his glory when he is revealed to the whole world. As a fellow elder, I appeal to you.
601Pt 5:2 Care for the flock that God has entrusted to you. Watch over it willingly, not grudgingly - not for what you will get out of it, but because you are eager to serve God.
601Pt 5:3 Don't lord it over the people assigned to your care, but lead them by your own good example.
601Pt 5:4 And when the Great Shepherd appears, you will receive a crown of never-ending glory and honor.
601Pt 5:5 In the same way, you younger men must accept the authority of the elders. And all of you, serve each other in humility, for "God opposes the proud but favors the humble."�� / ��Prov 3.34 (Greek version)
601Pt 5:6 So humble yourselves under the mighty power of God, and at the right time he will lift you up in honor.
601Pt 5:7 Give all your worries and cares to God, for he cares about you.
601Pt 5:8 Stay alert! Watch out for your great enemy, the devil. He prowls around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.
601Pt 5:9 Stand firm against him, and be strong in your faith. Remember that your Christian brothers and sisters�� all over the world are going through the same kind of suffering you are. / ��Greek your brothers
601Pt 5:10 In his kindness God called you to share in his eternal glory by means of Christ Jesus. So after you have suffered a little while, he will restore, support, and strengthen you, and he will place you on a firm foundation.
601Pt 5:11 All power to him forever! Amen.
601Pt 5:12 I have written and sent this short letter to you with the help of Silas��, whom I commend to you as a faithful brother. My purpose in writing is to encourage you and assure you that what you are experiencing is truly part of God's grace for you. Stand firm in this grace. / ��Greek Silvanus
601Pt 5:13 Your sister church here in Babylon�� sends you greetings, and so does my son Mark. / ��Greek The elect one in Babylon. Babylon was probably symbolic for Rome
601Pt 5:14 Greet each other with Christian love��. Peace be with all of you who are in Christ. / ��Greek with a kiss of love

612Pt 1:1 This letter is from Simon�� Peter, a slave and apostle of Jesus Christ. I am writing to you who share the same precious faith we have. This faith was given to you because of the justice and fairness�� of Jesus Christ, our God and Savior. / ��Greek Symeon ��Or to you in the righteousness
612Pt 1:2 May God give you more and more grace and peace as you grow in your knowledge of God and Jesus our Lord.
612Pt 1:3 By his divine power, God has given us everything we need for living a godly life. We have received all of this by coming to know him, the one who called us to himself by means of his marvelous glory and excellence.
612Pt 1:4 And because of his glory and excellence, he has given us great and precious promises. These are the promises that enable you to share his divine nature and escape the world's corruption caused by human desires.
612Pt 1:5 In view of all this, make every effort to respond to God's promises. Supplement your faith with a generous provision of moral excellence, and moral excellence with knowledge,
612Pt 1:6 and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with patient endurance, and patient endurance with godliness,
612Pt 1:7 and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love for everyone.
612Pt 1:8 The more you grow like this, the more productive and useful you will be in your knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
612Pt 1:9 But those who fail to develop in this way are shortsighted or blind, forgetting that they have been cleansed from their old sins.
612Pt 1:10 So, dear brothers and sisters��, work hard to prove that you really are among those God has called and chosen. Do these things, and you will never fall away. / ��Greek brothers
612Pt 1:11 Then God will give you a grand entrance into the eternal Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
612Pt 1:12 Therefore, I will always remind you about these things - even though you already know them and are standing firm in the truth you have been taught.
612Pt 1:13 And it is only right that I should keep on reminding you as long as I live��. / ��Greek as long as I am in this tent [or tabernacle]
612Pt 1:14 For our Lord Jesus Christ has shown me that I must soon leave this earthly life��, / ��Greek I must soon put off my tent [or tabernacle]
612Pt 1:15 so I will work hard to make sure you always remember these things after I am gone.
612Pt 1:16 For we were not making up clever stories when we told you about the powerful coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. We saw his majestic splendor with our own eyes
612Pt 1:17 when he received honor and glory from God the Father. The voice from the majestic glory of God said to him, "This is my dearly loved Son, who brings me great joy."�� / ��Matt 17.5; Mark 9.7; Luke 9.35
612Pt 1:18 We ourselves heard that voice from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.
612Pt 1:19 Because of that experience, we have even greater confidence in the message proclaimed by the prophets. You must pay close attention to what they wrote, for their words are like a lamp shining in a dark place - until the Day dawns, and Christ the Morning Star shines�� in your hearts. / ��Or rises
612Pt 1:20 Above all, you must realize that no prophecy in Scripture ever came from the prophet's own understanding��, / ��Or is a matter of one's own interpretation
612Pt 1:21 or from human initiative. No, those prophets were moved by the Holy Spirit, and they spoke from God.
612Pt 2:1 But there were also false prophets in Israel, just as there will be false teachers among you. They will cleverly teach destructive heresies and even deny the Master who bought them. In this way, they will bring sudden destruction on themselves.
612Pt 2:2 Many will follow their evil teaching and shameful immorality. And because of these teachers, the way of truth will be slandered.
612Pt 2:3 In their greed they will make up clever lies to get hold of your money. But God condemned them long ago, and their destruction will not be delayed.
612Pt 2:4 For God did not spare even the angels who sinned. He threw them into hell��, in gloomy pits of darkness��, where they are being held until the day of judgment. / ��Greek Tartarus ��Some manuscripts read in chains of gloom
612Pt 2:5 And God did not spare the ancient world - except for Noah and the seven others in his family. Noah warned the world of God's righteous judgment. So God protected Noah when he destroyed the world of ungodly people with a vast flood.
612Pt 2:6 Later, God condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and turned them into heaps of ashes. He made them an example of what will happen to ungodly people.
612Pt 2:7 But God also rescued Lot out of Sodom because he was a righteous man who was sick of the shameful immorality of the wicked people around him.
612Pt 2:8 Yes, Lot was a righteous man who was tormented in his soul by the wickedness he saw and heard day after day.
612Pt 2:9 So you see, the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials, even while keeping the wicked under punishment until the day of final judgment.
612Pt 2:10 He is especially hard on those who follow their own twisted sexual desire, and who despise authority. These people are proud and arrogant, daring even to scoff at supernatural beings�� without so much as trembling. / ��Greek at glorious ones, which are probably evil angels
612Pt 2:11 But the angels, who are far greater in power and strength, do not dare to bring from the Lord�� a charge of blasphemy against those supernatural beings. / ��Other manuscripts read to the Lord; still others do not include this phrase at all
612Pt 2:12 These false teachers are like unthinking animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed. They scoff at things they do not understand, and like animals, they will be destroyed.
612Pt 2:13 Their destruction is their reward for the harm they have done. They love to indulge in evil pleasures in broad daylight. They are a disgrace and a stain among you. They delight in deception�� even as they eat with you in your fellowship meals. / ��Some manuscripts read in fellowship meals
612Pt 2:14 They commit adultery with their eyes, and their desire for sin is never satisfied. They lure unstable people into sin, and they are well trained in greed. They live under God's curse.
612Pt 2:15 They have wandered off the right road and followed the footsteps of Balaam son of Beor��, who loved to earn money by doing wrong. / ��Some manuscripts read Bosor
612Pt 2:16 But Balaam was stopped from his mad course when his donkey rebuked him with a human voice.
612Pt 2:17 These people are as useless as dried-up springs or as mist blown away by the wind. They are doomed to blackest darkness.
612Pt 2:18 They brag about themselves with empty, foolish boasting. With an appeal to twisted sexual desires, they lure back into sin those who have barely escaped from a lifestyle of deception.
612Pt 2:19 They promise freedom, but they themselves are slaves of sin and corruption. For you are a slave to whatever controls you.
612Pt 2:20 And when people escape from the wickedness of the world by knowing our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and then get tangled up and enslaved by sin again, they are worse off than before.
612Pt 2:21 It would be better if they had never known the way to righteousness than to know it and then reject the command they were given to live a holy life.
612Pt 2:22 They prove the truth of this proverb�� "A dog returns to its vomit."�� And another says, "A washed pig returns to the mud." / ��Prov 26.11
612Pt 3:1 This is my second letter to you, dear friends, and in both of them I have tried to stimulate your wholesome thinking and refresh your memory.
612Pt 3:2 I want you to remember what the holy prophets said long ago and what our Lord and Savior commanded through your apostles.
612Pt 3:3 Most importantly, I want to remind you that in the last days scoffers will come, mocking the truth and following their own desires.
612Pt 3:4 They will say, "What happened to the promise that Jesus is coming again? From before the times of our ancestors, everything has remained the same since the world was first created."
612Pt 3:5 They deliberately forget that God made the heavens by the word of his command, and he brought the earth out from the water and surrounded it with water.
612Pt 3:6 Then he used the water to destroy the ancient world with a mighty flood.
612Pt 3:7 And by the same word, the present heavens and earth have been stored up for fire. They are being kept for the day of judgment, when ungodly people will be destroyed.
612Pt 3:8 But you must not forget this one thing, dear friends�� A day is like a thousand years to the Lord, and a thousand years is like a day.
612Pt 3:9 The Lord isn't really being slow about his promise, as some people think. No, he is being patient for your sake. He does not want anyone to be destroyed, but wants everyone to repent.
612Pt 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come as unexpectedly as a thief. Then the heavens will pass away with a terrible noise, and the very elements themselves will disappear in fire, and the earth and everything on it will be found to deserve judgment��. / ��Other manuscripts read will be burned up; still others read will be found destroyed
612Pt 3:11 Since everything around us is going to be destroyed like this, what holy and godly lives you should live,
612Pt 3:12 looking forward to the day of God and hurrying it along. On that day, he will set the heavens on fire, and the elements will melt away in the flames.
612Pt 3:13 But we are looking forward to the new heavens and new earth he has promised, a world filled with God's righteousness.
612Pt 3:14 And so, dear friends, while you are waiting for these things to happen, make every effort to be found living peaceful lives that are pure and blameless in his sight.
612Pt 3:15 And remember, our Lord's patience gives people time to be saved. This is what our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you with the wisdom God gave him - 
612Pt 3:16 speaking of these things in all of his letters. Some of his comments are hard to understand, and those who are ignorant and unstable have twisted his letters to mean something quite different, just as they do with other parts of Scripture. And this will result in their destruction.
612Pt 3:17 I am warning you ahead of time, dear friends. Be on guard so that you will not be carried away by the errors of these wicked people and lose your own secure footing.
612Pt 3:18 Rather, you must grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. All glory to him, both now and forever! Amen.

621Jn 1:1 We proclaim to you the one who existed from the beginning��, whom we have heard and seen. We saw him with our own eyes and touched him with our own hands. He is the Word of life. / ��Greek What was from the beginning
621Jn 1:2 This one who is life itself was revealed to us, and we have seen him. And now we testify and proclaim to you that he is the one who is eternal life. He was with the Father, and then he was revealed to us.
621Jn 1:3 We proclaim to you what we ourselves have actually seen and heard so that you may have fellowship with us. And our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ.
621Jn 1:4 We are writing these things so that you may fully share our joy��. / ��Or so that our joy may be complete; some manuscripts read your joy
621Jn 1:5 This is the message we heard from Jesus�� and now declare to you�� God is light, and there is no darkness in him at all. / ��Greek from him
621Jn 1:6 So we are lying if we say we have fellowship with God but go on living in spiritual darkness; we are not practicing the truth.
621Jn 1:7 But if we are living in the light, as God is in the light, then we have fellowship with each other, and the blood of Jesus, his Son, cleanses us from all sin.
621Jn 1:8 If we claim we have no sin, we are only fooling ourselves and not living in the truth.
621Jn 1:9 But if we confess our sins to him, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all wickedness.
621Jn 1:10 If we claim we have not sinned, we are calling God a liar and showing that his word has no place in our hearts.
621Jn 2:1 My dear children, I am writing this to you so that you will not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate who pleads our case before the Father. He is Jesus Christ, the one who is truly righteous.
621Jn 2:2 He himself is the sacrifice that atones for our sins - and not only our sins but the sins of all the world.
621Jn 2:3 And we can be sure that we know him if we obey his commandments.
621Jn 2:4 If someone claims, "I know God," but doesn't obey God's commandments, that person is a liar and is not living in the truth.
621Jn 2:5 But those who obey God's word truly show how completely they love him. That is how we know we are living in him.
621Jn 2:6 Those who say they live in God should live their lives as Jesus did.
621Jn 2:7 Dear friends, I am not writing a new commandment for you; rather it is an old one you have had from the very beginning. This old commandment - to love one another - is the same message you heard before.
621Jn 2:8 Yet it is also new. Jesus lived the truth of this commandment, and you also are living it. For the darkness is disappearing, and the true light is already shining.
621Jn 2:9 If anyone claims, "I am living in the light," but hates a Christian brother or sister��, that person is still living in darkness. / ��Greek hates his brother; similarly in 2.11
621Jn 2:10 Anyone who loves another brother or sister�� is living in the light and does not cause others to stumble. / ��Greek loves his brother
621Jn 2:11 But anyone who hates another brother or sister is still living and walking in darkness. Such a person does not know the way to go, having been blinded by the darkness.
621Jn 2:12 I am writing to you who are God's children because your sins have been forgiven through Jesus��. / ��Greek through his name
621Jn 2:13 I am writing to you who are mature in the faith�� because you know Christ, who existed from the beginning. I am writing to you who are young in the faith because you have won your battle with the evil one. / ��Or to you fathers; also in 2.14
621Jn 2:14 I have written to you who are God's children because you know the Father. I have written to you who are mature in the faith because you know Christ, who existed from the beginning. I have written to you who are young in the faith because you are strong. God's word lives in your hearts, and you have won your battle with the evil one.
621Jn 2:15 Do not love this world nor the things it offers you, for when you love the world, you do not have the love of the Father in you.
621Jn 2:16 For the world offers only a craving for physical pleasure, a craving for everything we see, and pride in our achievements and possessions. These are not from the Father, but are from this world.
621Jn 2:17 And this world is fading away, along with everything that people crave. But anyone who does what pleases God will live forever.
621Jn 2:18 Dear children, the last hour is here. You have heard that the Antichrist is coming, and already many such antichrists have appeared. From this we know that the last hour has come.
621Jn 2:19 These people left our churches, but they never really belonged with us; otherwise they would have stayed with us. When they left, it proved that they did not belong with us.
621Jn 2:20 But you are not like that, for the Holy One has given you his Spirit��, and all of you know the truth. / ��Greek But you have an anointing from the Holy One
621Jn 2:21 So I am writing to you not because you don't know the truth but because you know the difference between truth and lies.
621Jn 2:22 And who is a liar? Anyone who says that Jesus is not the Christ��. Anyone who denies the Father and the Son is an antichrist��. / ��Or not the Messiah ��Or the antichrist
621Jn 2:23 Anyone who denies the Son doesn't have the Father, either. But anyone who acknowledges the Son has the Father also.
621Jn 2:24 So you must remain faithful to what you have been taught from the beginning. If you do, you will remain in fellowship with the Son and with the Father.
621Jn 2:25 And in this fellowship we enjoy the eternal life he promised us.
621Jn 2:26 I am writing these things to warn you about those who want to lead you astray.
621Jn 2:27 But you have received the Holy Spirit��, and he lives within you, so you don't need anyone to teach you what is true. For the Spirit�� teaches you everything you need to know, and what he teaches is true - it is not a lie. So just as he has taught you, remain in fellowship with Christ. / ��Greek the anointing from him ��Greek the anointing
621Jn 2:28 And now, dear children, remain in fellowship with Christ so that when he returns, you will be full of courage and not shrink back from him in shame.
621Jn 2:29 Since we know that Christ is righteous, we also know that all who do what is right are God's children.
621Jn 3:1 See how very much our Father loves us, for he calls us his children, and that is what we are! But the people who belong to this world don't recognize that we are God's children because they don't know him.
621Jn 3:2 Dear friends, we are already God's children, but he has not yet shown us what we will be like when Christ appears. But we do know that we will be like him, for we will see him as he really is.
621Jn 3:3 And all who have this eager expectation will keep themselves pure, just as he is pure.
621Jn 3:4 Everyone who sins is breaking God's law, for all sin is contrary to the law of God.
621Jn 3:5 And you know that Jesus came to take away our sins, and there is no sin in him.
621Jn 3:6 Anyone who continues to live in him will not sin. But anyone who keeps on sinning does not know him or understand who he is.
621Jn 3:7 Dear children, don't let anyone deceive you about this�� When people do what is right, it shows that they are righteous, even as Christ is righteous.
621Jn 3:8 But when people keep on sinning, it shows that they belong to the devil, who has been sinning since the beginning. But the Son of God came to destroy the works of the devil.
621Jn 3:9 Those who have been born into God's family do not make a practice of sinning, because God's life�� is in them. So they can't keep on sinning, because they are children of God. / ��Greek because his seed
621Jn 3:10 So now we can tell who are children of God and who are children of the devil. Anyone who does not live righteously and does not love other believers�� does not belong to God. / ��Greek does not love his brother
621Jn 3:11 This is the message you have heard from the beginning�� We should love one another.
621Jn 3:12 We must not be like Cain, who belonged to the evil one and killed his brother. And why did he kill him? Because Cain had been doing what was evil, and his brother had been doing what was righteous.
621Jn 3:13 So don't be surprised, dear brothers and sisters��, if the world hates you. / ��Greek brothers
621Jn 3:14 If we love our Christian brothers and sisters��, it proves that we have passed from death to life. But a person who has no love is still dead. / ��Greek the brothers; similarly in 3.16
621Jn 3:15 Anyone who hates another brother or sister�� is really a murderer at heart. And you know that murderers don't have eternal life within them. / ��Greek hates his brother
621Jn 3:16 We know what real love is because Jesus gave up his life for us. So we also ought to give up our lives for our brothers and sisters.
621Jn 3:17 If someone has enough money to live well and sees a brother or sister�� in need but shows no compassion - how can God's love be in that person? / ��Greek sees his brother
621Jn 3:18 Dear children, let's not merely say that we love each other; let us show the truth by our actions.
621Jn 3:19 Our actions will show that we belong to the truth, so we will be confident when we stand before God.
621Jn 3:20 Even if we feel guilty, God is greater than our feelings, and he knows everything.
621Jn 3:21 Dear friends, if we don't feel guilty, we can come to God with bold confidence.
621Jn 3:22 And we will receive from him whatever we ask because we obey him and do the things that please him.
621Jn 3:23 And this is his commandment�� We must believe in the name of his Son, Jesus Christ, and love one another, just as he commanded us.
621Jn 3:24 Those who obey God's commandments remain in fellowship with him, and he with them. And we know he lives in us because the Spirit he gave us lives in us.
621Jn 4:1 Dear friends, do not believe everyone who claims to speak by the Spirit. You must test them to see if the spirit they have comes from God. For there are many false prophets in the world.
621Jn 4:2 This is how we know if they have the Spirit of God�� If a person claiming to be a prophet�� acknowledges that Jesus Christ came in a real body, that person has the Spirit of God. / ��Greek If a spirit; similarly in 4.3
621Jn 4:3 But if someone claims to be a prophet and does not acknowledge the truth about Jesus, that person is not from God. Such a person has the spirit of the Antichrist, which you heard is coming into the world and indeed is already here.
621Jn 4:4 But you belong to God, my dear children. You have already won a victory over those people, because the Spirit who lives in you is greater than the spirit who lives in the world.
621Jn 4:5 Those people belong to this world, so they speak from the world's viewpoint, and the world listens to them.
621Jn 4:6 But we belong to God, and those who know God listen to us. If they do not belong to God, they do not listen to us. That is how we know if someone has the Spirit of truth or the spirit of deception.
621Jn 4:7 Dear friends, let us continue to love one another, for love comes from God. Anyone who loves is a child of God and knows God.
621Jn 4:8 But anyone who does not love does not know God, for God is love.
621Jn 4:9 God showed how much he loved us by sending his one and only Son into the world so that we might have eternal life through him.
621Jn 4:10 This is real love - not that we loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son as a sacrifice to take away our sins.
621Jn 4:11 Dear friends, since God loved us that much, we surely ought to love each other.
621Jn 4:12 No one has ever seen God. But if we love each other, God lives in us, and his love is brought to full expression in us.
621Jn 4:13 And God has given us his Spirit as proof that we live in him and he in us.
621Jn 4:14 Furthermore, we have seen with our own eyes and now testify that the Father sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.
621Jn 4:15 All who confess that Jesus is the Son of God have God living in them, and they live in God.
621Jn 4:16 We know how much God loves us, and we have put our trust in his love. God is love, and all who live in love live in God, and God lives in them.
621Jn 4:17 And as we live in God, our love grows more perfect. So we will not be afraid on the day of judgment, but we can face him with confidence because we live like Jesus here in this world.
621Jn 4:18 Such love has no fear, because perfect love expels all fear. If we are afraid, it is for fear of punishment, and this shows that we have not fully experienced his perfect love.
621Jn 4:19 We love each other�� because he loved us first. / ��Greek We love. Other manuscripts read We love God; still others read We love him
621Jn 4:20 If someone says, "I love God," but hates a Christian brother or sister��, that person is a liar; for if we don't love people we can see, how can we love God, whom we cannot see? / ��Greek hates his brother
621Jn 4:21 And he has given us this command�� Those who love God must also love their Christian brothers and sisters��. / ��Greek The one who loves God must also love his brother
621Jn 5:1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ�� has become a child of God. And everyone who loves the Father loves his children, too. / ��Or the Messiah
621Jn 5:2 We know we love God's children if we love God and obey his commandments.
621Jn 5:3 Loving God means keeping his commandments, and his commandments are not burdensome.
621Jn 5:4 For every child of God defeats this evil world, and we achieve this victory through our faith.
621Jn 5:5 And who can win this battle against the world? Only those who believe that Jesus is the Son of God.
621Jn 5:6 And Jesus Christ was revealed as God's Son by his baptism in water and by shedding his blood on the cross�� - not by water only, but by water and blood. And the Spirit, who is truth, confirms it with his testimony. / ��Greek This is he who came by water and blood
621Jn 5:7 So we have these three witnesses�� - / ��A few very late manuscripts add in heaven - the Father, the Word, and the Holy Spirit, and these three are one. And we have three witnesses on earth
621Jn 5:8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood - and all three agree.
621Jn 5:9 Since we believe human testimony, surely we can believe the greater testimony that comes from God. And God has testified about his Son.
621Jn 5:10 All who believe in the Son of God know in their hearts that this testimony is true. Those who don't believe this are actually calling God a liar because they don't believe what God has testified about his Son.
621Jn 5:11 And this is what God has testified�� He has given us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
621Jn 5:12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have God's Son does not have life.
621Jn 5:13 I have written this to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know you have eternal life.
621Jn 5:14 And we are confident that he hears us whenever we ask for anything that pleases him.
621Jn 5:15 And since we know he hears us when we make our requests, we also know that he will give us what we ask for.
621Jn 5:16 If you see a Christian brother or sister�� sinning in a way that does not lead to death, you should pray, and God will give that person life. But there is a sin that leads to death, and I am not saying you should pray for those who commit it. / ��Greek a brother
621Jn 5:17 All wicked actions are sin, but not every sin leads to death.
621Jn 5:18 We know that God's children do not make a practice of sinning, for God's Son holds them securely, and the evil one cannot touch them.
621Jn 5:19 We know that we are children of God and that the world around us is under the control of the evil one.
621Jn 5:20 And we know that the Son of God has come, and he has given us understanding so that we can know the true God��. And now we live in fellowship with the true God because we live in fellowship with his Son, Jesus Christ. He is the only true God, and he is eternal life. / ��Greek the one who is true
621Jn 5:21 Dear children, keep away from anything that might take God's place in your hearts��. / ��Greek keep yourselves from idols
63
632Jn 1:1 This letter is from John, the elder��. I am writing to the chosen lady and to her children��, whom I love in the truth - as does everyone else who knows the truth - / ��Greek From the elder ��Or the church God has chosen and its members
632Jn 1:2 because the truth lives in us and will be with us forever.
632Jn 1:3 Grace, mercy, and peace, which come from God the Father and from Jesus Christ - the Son of the Father - will continue to be with us who live in truth and love.
632Jn 1:4 How happy I was to meet some of your children and find them living according to the truth, just as the Father commanded.
632Jn 1:5 I am writing to remind you, dear friends��, that we should love one another. This is not a new commandment, but one we have had from the beginning. / ��Greek I urge you, lady
632Jn 1:6 Love means doing what God has commanded us, and he has commanded us to love one another, just as you heard from the beginning.
632Jn 1:7 I say this because many deceivers have gone out into the world. They deny that Jesus Christ came�� in a real body. Such a person is a deceiver and an antichrist. / ��Or will come
632Jn 1:8 Watch out that you do not lose what we�� have worked so hard to achieve. Be diligent so that you receive your full reward. / ��Some manuscripts read you
632Jn 1:9 Anyone who wanders away from this teaching has no relationship with God. But anyone who remains in the teaching of Christ has a relationship with both the Father and the Son.
632Jn 1:10 If anyone comes to your meeting and does not teach the truth about Christ, don't invite that person into your home or give any kind of encouragement.
632Jn 1:11 Anyone who encourages such people becomes a partner in their evil work.
632Jn 1:12 I have much more to say to you, but I don't want to do it with paper and ink. For I hope to visit you soon and talk with you face to face. Then our joy will be complete.
632Jn 1:13 Greetings from the children of your sister��, chosen by God. / ��Or from the members of your sister church
64
643Jn 1:1 This letter is from John, the elder��. I am writing to Gaius, my dear friend, whom I love in the truth. / ��Greek From the elder
643Jn 1:2 Dear friend, I hope all is well with you and that you are as healthy in body as you are strong in spirit.
643Jn 1:3 Some of the traveling teachers�� recently returned and made me very happy by telling me about your faithfulness and that you are living according to the truth. / ��Greek the brothers; also in verses 5 and 10
643Jn 1:4 I could have no greater joy than to hear that my children are following the truth.
643Jn 1:5 Dear friend, you are being faithful to God when you care for the traveling teachers who pass through, even though they are strangers to you.
643Jn 1:6 They have told the church here of your loving friendship. Please continue providing for such teachers in a manner that pleases God.
643Jn 1:7 For they are traveling for the Lord��, and they accept nothing from people who are not believers��. / ��Greek They went out on behalf of the Name ��Greek from Gentiles
643Jn 1:8 So we ourselves should support them so that we can be their partners as they teach the truth.
643Jn 1:9 I wrote to the church about this, but Diotrephes, who loves to be the leader, refuses to have anything to do with us.
643Jn 1:10 When I come, I will report some of the things he is doing and the evil accusations he is making against us. Not only does he refuse to welcome the traveling teachers, he also tells others not to help them. And when they do help, he puts them out of the church.
643Jn 1:11 Dear friend, don't let this bad example influence you. Follow only what is good. Remember that those who do good prove that they are God's children, and those who do evil prove that they do not know God��. / ��Greek they have not seen God
643Jn 1:12 Everyone speaks highly of Demetrius, as does the truth itself. We ourselves can say the same for him, and you know we speak the truth.
643Jn 1:13 I have much more to say to you, but I don't want to write it with pen and ink.
643Jn 1:14 For I hope to see you soon, and then we will talk face to face.
643Jn 1:15 ��Peace be with you. Your friends here send you their greetings. Please give my personal greetings to each of our friends there. / ��Some English translations combine verses 14 and 15 into verse 14

65Jd 1:1 This letter is from Jude, a slave of Jesus Christ and a brother of James. I am writing to all who have been called by God the Father, who loves you and keeps you safe in the care of Jesus Christ��. / ��Or keeps you for Jesus Christ
65Jd 1:2 May God give you more and more mercy, peace, and love.
65Jd 1:3 Dear friends, I had been eagerly planning to write to you about the salvation we all share. But now I find that I must write about something else, urging you to defend the faith that God has entrusted once for all time to his holy people.
65Jd 1:4 I say this because some ungodly people have wormed their way into your churches, saying that God's marvelous grace allows us to live immoral lives. The condemnation of such people was recorded long ago, for they have denied our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
65Jd 1:5 So I want to remind you, though you already know these things, that Jesus�� first rescued the nation of Israel from Egypt, but later he destroyed those who did not remain faithful. / ��As in the best manuscripts; various other manuscripts read [the] Lord, or God, or Christ; one reads God Christ
65Jd 1:6 And I remind you of the angels who did not stay within the limits of authority God gave them but left the place where they belonged. God has kept them securely chained in prisons of darkness, waiting for the great day of judgment.
65Jd 1:7 And don't forget Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns, which were filled with immorality and every kind of sexual perversion. Those cities were destroyed by fire and serve as a warning of the eternal fire of God's judgment.
65Jd 1:8 In the same way, these people - who claim authority from their dreams - live immoral lives, defy authority, and scoff at supernatural beings��. / ��Greek at glorious ones, which are probably evil angels
65Jd 1:9 But even Michael, one of the mightiest of the angels��, did not dare accuse the devil of blasphemy, but simply said, "The Lord rebuke you!" (This took place when Michael was arguing with the devil about Moses' body.) / ��Greek Michael, the archangel
65Jd 1:10 But these people scoff at things they do not understand. Like unthinking animals, they do whatever their instincts tell them, and so they bring about their own destruction.
65Jd 1:11 What sorrow awaits them! For they follow in the footsteps of Cain, who killed his brother. Like Balaam, they deceive people for money. And like Korah, they perish in their rebellion.
65Jd 1:12 When these people eat with you in your fellowship meals commemorating the Lord's love, they are like dangerous reefs that can shipwreck you��. They are like shameless shepherds who care only for themselves. They are like clouds blowing over the land without giving any rain. They are like trees in autumn that are doubly dead, for they bear no fruit and have been pulled up by the roots. / ��Or they are contaminants among you; or they are stains
65Jd 1:13 They are like wild waves of the sea, churning up the foam of their shameful deeds. They are like wandering stars, doomed forever to blackest darkness.
65Jd 1:14 Enoch, who lived in the seventh generation after Adam, prophesied about these people. He said, "Listen! The Lord is coming with countless thousands of his holy ones
65Jd 1:15 to execute judgment on the people of the world. He will convict every person of all the ungodly things they have done and for all the insults that ungodly sinners have spoken against him."�� / ��The quotation comes from intertestamental literature�� Enoch 1.9
65Jd 1:16 These people are grumblers and complainers, living only to satisfy their desires. They brag loudly about themselves, and they flatter others to get what they want.
65Jd 1:17 But you, my dear friends, must remember what the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ said.
65Jd 1:18 They told you that in the last times there would be scoffers whose purpose in life is to satisfy their ungodly desires.
65Jd 1:19 These people are the ones who are creating divisions among you. They follow their natural instincts because they do not have God's Spirit in them.
65Jd 1:20 But you, dear friends, must build each other up in your most holy faith, pray in the power of the Holy Spirit��, / ��Greek pray in the Holy Spirit
65Jd 1:21 and await the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will bring you eternal life. In this way, you will keep yourselves safe in God's love.
65Jd 1:22 And you must show mercy to�� those whose faith is wavering. / ��Some manuscripts read must reprove
65Jd 1:23 Rescue others by snatching them from the flames of judgment. Show mercy to still others��, but do so with great caution, hating the sins that contaminate their lives��. / ��Some manuscripts have only two categories of people�� (1) those whose faith is wavering and therefore need to be snatched from the flames of judgment, and (2) those who need to be shown mercy ��Greek with fear, hating even the clothing stained by the flesh
65Jd 1:24 Now all glory to God, who is able to keep you from falling away and will bring you with great joy into his glorious presence without a single fault.
65Jd 1:25 All glory to him who alone is God, our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord. All glory, majesty, power, and authority are his before all time, and in the present, and beyond all time! Amen.

66Rv 1:1 This is a revelation from�� Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show his servants the events that must soon�� take place. He sent an angel to present this revelation to his servant John, / ��Or of ��Or suddenly, or quickly

66Rv 1:4 This letter is from John to the seven churches in the province of Asia��.

66Rv 1:6 He has made us a Kingdom of priests for God his Father. All glory and power to him forever and ever! Amen.

66Rv 1:9 I, John, am your brother and your partner in suffering and in God's Kingdom and in the patient endurance to which Jesus calls us. I was exiled to the island of Patmos for preaching the word of God and for my testimony about Jesus.
66Rv 1:10 It was the Lord's Day, and I was worshiping in the Spirit��. Suddenly, I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet blast. / ��Or in spirit
66Rv 1:11 It said, "Write in a book�� everything you see, and send it to the seven churches in the cities of Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea." / ��Or on a scroll
66Rv 1:12 When I turned to see who was speaking to me, I saw seven gold lampstands.
66Rv 1:13 And standing in the middle of the lampstands was someone like the Son of Man��. He was wearing a long robe with a gold sash across his chest. / ��Or like a son of man. See Dan 7.13. "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
66Rv 1:14 His head and his hair were white like wool, as white as snow. And his eyes were like flames of fire.
66Rv 1:15 His feet were like polished bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice thundered like mighty ocean waves.
66Rv 1:16 He held seven stars in his right hand, and a sharp two-edged sword came from his mouth. And his face was like the sun in all its brilliance.
66Rv 1:17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as if I were dead. But he laid his right hand on me and said, "Don't be afraid! I am the First and the Last.
66Rv 1:18 I am the living one. I died, but look - I am alive forever and ever! And I hold the keys of death and the grave��. / ��Greek and Hades
66Rv 1:19 "Write down what you have seen - both the things that are now happening and the things that will happen��. / ��Or what you have seen and what they mean - the things that have already begun to happen
66Rv 1:20 This is the meaning of the mystery of the seven stars you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lampstands�� The seven stars are the angels�� of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches. / ��Or the messengers
66Rv 2:1 "Write this letter to the angel�� of the church in Ephesus. This is the message from the one who holds the seven stars in his right hand, the one who walks among the seven gold lampstands. / ��Or the messenger; also in 2.8, 12, 18
66Rv 2:2 "I know all the things you do. I have seen your hard work and your patient endurance. I know you don't tolerate evil people. You have examined the claims of those who say they are apostles but are not. You have discovered they are liars.
66Rv 2:3 You have patiently suffered for me without quitting.
66Rv 2:4 "But I have this complaint against you. You don't love me or each other as you did at first��! / ��Greek You have lost your first love
66Rv 2:5 Look how far you have fallen! Turn back to me and do the works you did at first. If you don't repent, I will come and remove your lampstand from its place among the churches.
66Rv 2:6 But this is in your favor�� You hate the evil deeds of the Nicolaitans, just as I do.
66Rv 2:7 "Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches. To everyone who is victorious I will give fruit from the tree of life in the paradise of God.

66Rv 2:9 "I know about your suffering and your poverty - but you are rich! I know the blasphemy of those opposing you. They say they are Jews, but they are not, because their synagogue belongs to Satan.
66Rv 2:10 Don't be afraid of what you are about to suffer. The devil will throw some of you into prison to test you. You will suffer for ten days. But if you remain faithful even when facing death, I will give you the crown of life.

66Rv 2:12 "Write this letter to the angel of the church in Pergamum. This is the message from the one with the sharp two-edged sword.
66Rv 2:13 "I know that you live in the city where Satan has his throne, yet you have remained loyal to me. You refused to deny me even when Antipas, my faithful witness, was martyred among you there in Satan's city.
66Rv 2:14 "But I have a few complaints against you. You tolerate some among you whose teaching is like that of Balaam, who showed Balak how to trip up the people of Israel. He taught them to sin by eating food offered to idols and by committing sexual sin.
66Rv 2:15 In a similar way, you have some Nicolaitans among you who follow the same teaching.
66Rv 2:16 Repent of your sin, or I will come to you suddenly and fight against them with the sword of my mouth.
66Rv 2:17 "Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches.

66Rv 2:20 "But I have this complaint against you. You are permitting that woman - that Jezebel who calls herself a prophet - to lead my servants astray. She teaches them to commit sexual sin and to eat food offered to idols.
66Rv 2:21 I gave her time to repent, but she does not want to turn away from her immorality.
66Rv 2:22 "Therefore, I will throw her on a bed of suffering��, and those who commit adultery with her will suffer greatly unless they repent and turn away from her evil deeds. / ��Greek a bed
66Rv 2:23 I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am the one who searches out the thoughts and intentions of every person. And I will give to each of you whatever you deserve.

66Rv 3:22 "Anyone with ears to hear must listen to the Spirit and understand what he is saying to the churches."
66Rv 4:1 Then as I looked, I saw a door standing open in heaven, and the same voice I had heard before spoke to me like a trumpet blast. The voice said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after this."
66Rv 4:2 And instantly I was in the Spirit��, and I saw a throne in heaven and someone sitting on it. / ��Or in spirit
66Rv 4:3 The one sitting on the throne was as brilliant as gemstones - like jasper and carnelian. And the glow of an emerald circled his throne like a rainbow.
66Rv 4:4 Twenty-four thrones surrounded him, and twenty-four elders sat on them. They were all clothed in white and had gold crowns on their heads.
66Rv 4:5 From the throne came flashes of lightning and the rumble of thunder. And in front of the throne were seven torches with burning flames. This is the sevenfold Spirit�� of God. / ��Greek They are the seven spirits
66Rv 4:6 In front of the throne was a shiny sea of glass, sparkling like crystal. In the center and around the throne were four living beings, each covered with eyes, front and back.
66Rv 4:7 The first of these living beings was like a lion; the second was like an ox; the third had a human face; and the fourth was like an eagle in flight.
66Rv 4:8 Each of these living beings had six wings, and their wings were covered all over with eyes, inside and out. Day after day and night after night they keep on saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, the Almighty - the one who always was, who is, and who is still to come."
66Rv 4:9 Whenever the living beings give glory and honor and thanks to the one sitting on the throne (the one who lives forever and ever),
66Rv 4:10 the twenty-four elders fall down and worship the one sitting on the throne (the one who lives forever and ever). And they lay their crowns before the throne and say,
66Rv 4:11 "You are worthy, O Lord our God, to receive glory and honor and power. For you created all things, and they exist because you created what you pleased."
66Rv 5:1 Then I saw a scroll�� in the right hand of the one who was sitting on the throne. There was writing on the inside and the outside of the scroll, and it was sealed with seven seals. / ��Or book; also in 5.2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9
66Rv 5:2 And I saw a strong angel, who shouted with a loud voice�� "Who is worthy to break the seals on this scroll and open it?"
66Rv 5:3 But no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll and read it.
66Rv 5:4 Then I began to weep bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll and read it.
66Rv 5:5 But one of the twenty-four elders said to me, "Stop weeping! Look, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the heir to David's throne��, has won the victory. He is worthy to open the scroll and its seven seals." / ��Greek the root of David. See Isa 11.10
66Rv 5:6 Then I saw a Lamb that looked as if it had been slaughtered, but it was now standing between the throne and the four living beings and among the twenty-four elders. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which represent the sevenfold Spirit�� of God that is sent out into every part of the earth. / ��Greek which are the seven spirits
66Rv 5:7 He stepped forward and took the scroll from the right hand of the one sitting on the throne.
66Rv 5:8 And when he took the scroll, the four living beings and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb. Each one had a harp, and they held gold bowls filled with incense, which are the prayers of God's people.
66Rv 5:9 And they sang a new song with these words�� "You are worthy to take the scroll and break its seals and open it. For you were slaughtered, and your blood has ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation.
66Rv 5:10 And you have caused them to become a Kingdom of priests for our God. And they will reign�� on the earth." / ��Some manuscripts read they are reigning
66Rv 5:11 Then I looked again, and I heard the voices of thousands and millions of angels around the throne and of the living beings and the elders.
66Rv 5:12 And they sang in a mighty chorus�� "Worthy is the Lamb who was slaughtered - to receive power and riches and wisdom and strength and honor and glory and blessing."
66Rv 5:13 And then I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea. They sang�� "Blessing and honor and glory and power belong to the one sitting on the throne and to the Lamb forever and ever."
66Rv 5:14 And the four living beings said, "Amen!" And the twenty-four elders fell down and worshiped the Lamb.
66Rv 6:1 As I watched, the Lamb broke the first of the seven seals on the scroll��. Then I heard one of the four living beings say with a voice like thunder, "Come!" / ��Or book
66Rv 6:2 I looked up and saw a white horse standing there. Its rider carried a bow, and a crown was placed on his head. He rode out to win many battles and gain the victory.
66Rv 6:3 When the Lamb broke the second seal, I heard the second living being say, "Come!"
66Rv 6:4 Then another horse appeared, a red one. Its rider was given a mighty sword and the authority to take peace from the earth. And there was war and slaughter everywhere.
66Rv 6:5 When the Lamb broke the third seal, I heard the third living being say, "Come!" I looked up and saw a black horse, and its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand.
66Rv 6:6 And I heard a voice from among the four living beings say, "A loaf of wheat bread or three loaves of barley will cost a day's pay��. And don't waste�� the olive oil and wine." / ��Greek A choinix [1 quart or 1 liter] of wheat for a denarius, and 3 choinix of barley for a denarius. A denarius was equivalent to a laborer's full day's wage ��Or harm
66Rv 6:7 When the Lamb broke the fourth seal, I heard the fourth living being say, "Come!"
66Rv 6:8 I looked up and saw a horse whose color was pale green. Its rider was named Death, and his companion was the Grave��. These two were given authority over one-fourth of the earth, to kill with the sword and famine and disease�� and wild animals. / ��Greek was Hades ��Greek death
66Rv 6:9 When the Lamb broke the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of all who had been martyred for the word of God and for being faithful in their testimony.
66Rv 6:10 They shouted to the Lord and said, "O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you judge the people who belong to this world and avenge our blood for what they have done to us?"
66Rv 6:11 Then a white robe was given to each of them. And they were told to rest a little longer until the full number of their brothers and sisters�� - their fellow servants of Jesus who were to be martyred - had joined them. / ��Greek their brothers
66Rv 6:12 I watched as the Lamb broke the sixth seal, and there was a great earthquake. The sun became as dark as black cloth, and the moon became as red as blood.
66Rv 6:13 Then the stars of the sky fell to the earth like green figs falling from a tree shaken by a strong wind.
66Rv 6:14 The sky was rolled up like a scroll, and all of the mountains and islands were moved from their places.
66Rv 6:15 Then everyone - the kings of the earth, the rulers, the generals, the wealthy, the powerful, and every slave and free person - all hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains.
66Rv 6:16 And they cried to the mountains and the rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the Lamb.
66Rv 6:17 For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to survive?"
66Rv 7:1 Then I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds so they did not blow on the earth or the sea, or even on any tree.
66Rv 7:2 And I saw another angel coming up from the east, carrying the seal of the living God. And he shouted to those four angels, who had been given power to harm land and sea,
66Rv 7:3 "Wait! Don't harm the land or the sea or the trees until we have placed the seal of God on the foreheads of his servants."
66Rv 7:4 And I heard how many were marked with the seal of God - 144,000 were sealed from all the tribes of Israel.
66Rv 7:5 from Judah 12,000 from Reuben 12,000 from Gad 12,000 
66Rv 7:6 from Asher 12,000 from Naphtali 12,000 from Manasseh 12,000 
66Rv 7:7 from Simeon 12,000 from Levi 12,000 from Issachar 12,000 
66Rv 7:8 from Zebulun 12,000 from Joseph 12,000 from Benjamin 12,000 
66Rv 7:9 After this I saw a vast crowd, too great to count, from every nation and tribe and people and language, standing in front of the throne and before the Lamb. They were clothed in white robes and held palm branches in their hands.
66Rv 7:10 And they were shouting with a great roar, "Salvation comes from our God who sits on the throne and from the Lamb!"
66Rv 7:11 And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living beings. And they fell before the throne with their faces to the ground and worshiped God.
66Rv 7:12 They sang, "Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and strength belong to our God forever and ever! Amen."
66Rv 7:13 Then one of the twenty-four elders asked me, "Who are these who are clothed in white? Where did they come from?"
66Rv 7:14 And I said to him, "Sir, you are the one who knows." Then he said to me, "These are the ones who died in�� the great tribulation��. They have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb and made them white. / ��Greek who came out of ��Or the great suffering
66Rv 7:15 "That is why they stand in front of God's throne and serve him day and night in his Temple. And he who sits on the throne will give them shelter.
66Rv 7:16 They will never again be hungry or thirsty; they will never be scorched by the heat of the sun.
66Rv 7:17 For the Lamb on the throne�� will be their Shepherd. He will lead them to springs of life-giving water. And God will wipe every tear from their eyes." / ��Greek on the center of the throne
66Rv 8:1 When the Lamb broke the seventh seal on the scroll��, there was silence throughout heaven for about half an hour. / ��Or book
66Rv 8:2 I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and they were given seven trumpets.
66Rv 8:3 Then another angel with a gold incense burner came and stood at the altar. And a great amount of incense was given to him to mix with the prayers of God's people as an offering on the gold altar before the throne.
66Rv 8:4 The smoke of the incense, mixed with the prayers of God's holy people, ascended up to God from the altar where the angel had poured them out.
66Rv 8:5 Then the angel filled the incense burner with fire from the altar and threw it down upon the earth; and thunder crashed, lightning flashed, and there was a terrible earthquake.
66Rv 8:6 Then the seven angels with the seven trumpets prepared to blow their mighty blasts.
66Rv 8:7 The first angel blew his trumpet, and hail and fire mixed with blood were thrown down on the earth. One-third of the earth was set on fire, one-third of the trees were burned, and all the green grass was burned.
66Rv 8:8 Then the second angel blew his trumpet, and a great mountain of fire was thrown into the sea. One-third of the water in the sea became blood,
66Rv 8:9 one-third of all things living in the sea died, and one-third of all the ships on the sea were destroyed.
66Rv 8:10 Then the third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from the sky, burning like a torch. It fell on one-third of the rivers and on the springs of water.
66Rv 8:11 The name of the star was Bitterness��. It made one-third of the water bitter, and many people died from drinking the bitter water. / ��Greek Wormwood
66Rv 8:12 Then the fourth angel blew his trumpet, and one-third of the sun was struck, and one-third of the moon, and one-third of the stars, and they became dark. And one-third of the day was dark, and also one-third of the night.
66Rv 8:13 Then I looked, and I heard a single eagle crying loudly as it flew through the air, "Terror, terror, terror to all who belong to this world because of what will happen when the last three angels blow their trumpets."
66Rv 9:1 Then the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star that had fallen to earth from the sky, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit��. / ��Or the abyss, or the underworld; also in 9.11
66Rv 9:2 When he opened it, smoke poured out as though from a huge furnace, and the sunlight and air turned dark from the smoke.
66Rv 9:3 Then locusts came from the smoke and descended on the earth, and they were given power to sting like scorpions.
66Rv 9:4 They were told not to harm the grass or plants or trees, but only the people who did not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
66Rv 9:5 They were told not to kill them but to torture them for five months with pain like the pain of a scorpion sting.
66Rv 9:6 In those days people will seek death but will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them!
66Rv 9:7 The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. They had what looked like gold crowns on their heads, and their faces looked like human faces.
66Rv 9:8 They had hair like women's hair and teeth like the teeth of a lion.
66Rv 9:9 They wore armor made of iron, and their wings roared like an army of chariots rushing into battle.
66Rv 9:10 They had tails that stung like scorpions, and for five months they had the power to torment people.
66Rv 9:11 Their king is the angel from the bottomless pit; his name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek, Apollyon - the Destroyer.
66Rv 9:12 The first terror is past, but look, two more terrors are coming!
66Rv 9:13 Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice speaking from the four horns of the gold altar that stands in the presence of God.
66Rv 9:14 And the voice said to the sixth angel who held the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great Euphrates River."
66Rv 9:15 Then the four angels who had been prepared for this hour and day and month and year were turned loose to kill one-third of all the people on earth.
66Rv 9:16 I heard the size of their army, which was 200 million mounted troops.
66Rv 9:17 And in my vision, I saw the horses and the riders sitting on them. The riders wore armor that was fiery red and dark blue and yellow. The horses had heads like lions, and fire and smoke and burning sulfur billowed from their mouths.
66Rv 9:18 One-third of all the people on earth were killed by these three plagues - by the fire and smoke and burning sulfur that came from the mouths of the horses.
66Rv 9:19 Their power was in their mouths and in their tails. For their tails had heads like snakes, with the power to injure people.
66Rv 9:20 But the people who did not die in these plagues still refused to repent of their evil deeds and turn to God. They continued to worship demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood - idols that can neither see nor hear nor walk!
66Rv 9:21 And they did not repent of their murders or their witchcraft or their sexual immorality or their thefts.
66Rv 10:1 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, surrounded by a cloud, with a rainbow over his head. His face shone like the sun, and his feet were like pillars of fire.
66Rv 10:2 And in his hand was a small scroll�� that had been opened. He stood with his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land. / ��Or book; also in 10.8, 9, 10
66Rv 10:3 And he gave a great shout like the roar of a lion. And when he shouted, the seven thunders answered.
66Rv 10:4 When the seven thunders spoke, I was about to write. But I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Keep secret�� what the seven thunders said, and do not write it down." / ��Greek Seal up
66Rv 10:5 Then the angel I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand toward heaven.
66Rv 10:6 He swore an oath in the name of the one who lives forever and ever, who created the heavens and everything in them, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it. He said, "There will be no more delay.
66Rv 10:7 When the seventh angel blows his trumpet, God's mysterious plan will be fulfilled. It will happen just as he announced it to his servants the prophets."
66Rv 10:8 Then the voice from heaven spoke to me again�� "Go and take the open scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."
66Rv 10:9 So I went to the angel and told him to give me the small scroll. "Yes, take it and eat it," he said. "It will be sweet as honey in your mouth, but it will turn sour in your stomach!"
66Rv 10:10 So I took the small scroll from the hand of the angel, and I ate it! It was sweet in my mouth, but when I swallowed it, it turned sour in my stomach.
66Rv 10:11 Then I was told, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."
66Rv 11:1 Then I was given a measuring stick, and I was told, "Go and measure the Temple of God and the altar, and count the number of worshipers.
66Rv 11:2 But do not measure the outer courtyard, for it has been turned over to the nations. They will trample the holy city for 42 months.
66Rv 11:3 And I will give power to my two witnesses, and they will be clothed in burlap and will prophesy during those 1,260 days."
66Rv 11:4 These two prophets are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of all the earth.
66Rv 11:5 If anyone tries to harm them, fire flashes from their mouths and consumes their enemies. This is how anyone who tries to harm them must die.
66Rv 11:6 They have power to shut the sky so that no rain will fall for as long as they prophesy. And they have the power to turn the rivers and oceans into blood, and to strike the earth with every kind of plague as often as they wish.
66Rv 11:7 When they complete their testimony, the beast that comes up out of the bottomless pit�� will declare war against them, and he will conquer them and kill them. / ��Or the abyss, or the underworld
66Rv 11:8 And their bodies will lie in the main street of Jerusalem��, the city that is figuratively called "Sodom" and "Egypt," the city where their Lord was crucified. / ��Greek the great city
66Rv 11:9 And for three and a half days, all peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will stare at their bodies. No one will be allowed to bury them.
66Rv 11:10 All the people who belong to this world will gloat over them and give presents to each other to celebrate the death of the two prophets who had tormented them.
66Rv 11:11 But after three and a half days, God breathed life into them, and they stood up! Terror struck all who were staring at them.
66Rv 11:12 Then a loud voice from heaven called to the two prophets, "Come up here!" And they rose to heaven in a cloud as their enemies watched.
66Rv 11:13 At the same time there was a terrible earthquake that destroyed a tenth of the city. Seven thousand people died in that earthquake, and everyone else was terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
66Rv 11:14 The second terror is past, but look, the third terror is coming quickly.
66Rv 11:15 Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices shouting in heaven�� "The world has now become the Kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ��, and he will reign forever and ever." / ��Or his Messiah
66Rv 11:16 The twenty-four elders sitting on their thrones before God fell with their faces to the ground and worshiped him.
66Rv 11:17 And they said, "We give thanks to you, Lord God, the Almighty, the one who is and who always was, for now you have assumed your great power and have begun to reign.
66Rv 11:18 The nations were filled with wrath, but now the time of your wrath has come. It is time to judge the dead and reward your servants the prophets, as well as your holy people, and all who fear your name, from the least to the greatest. It is time to destroy all who have caused destruction on the earth."
66Rv 11:19 Then, in heaven, the Temple of God was opened and the Ark of his covenant could be seen inside the Temple. Lightning flashed, thunder crashed and roared, and there was an earthquake and a terrible hailstorm.
66Rv 12:1 Then I witnessed in heaven an event of great significance. I saw a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon beneath her feet, and a crown of twelve stars on her head.
66Rv 12:2 She was pregnant, and she cried out because of her labor pains and the agony of giving birth.
66Rv 12:3 Then I witnessed in heaven another significant event. I saw a large red dragon with seven heads and ten horns, with seven crowns on his heads.
66Rv 12:4 His tail swept away one-third of the stars in the sky, and he threw them to the earth. He stood in front of the woman as she was about to give birth, ready to devour her baby as soon as it was born.
66Rv 12:5 She gave birth to a son who was to rule all nations with an iron rod. And her child was snatched away from the dragon and was caught up to God and to his throne.
66Rv 12:6 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where God had prepared a place to care for her for 1,260 days.
66Rv 12:7 Then there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon and his angels.
66Rv 12:8 And the dragon lost the battle, and he and his angels were forced out of heaven.
66Rv 12:9 This great dragon - the ancient serpent called the devil, or Satan, the one deceiving the whole world - was thrown down to the earth with all his angels.
66Rv 12:10 Then I heard a loud voice shouting across the heavens, "It has come at last - salvation and power and the Kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ��. For the accuser of our brothers and sisters�� has been thrown down to earth - the one who accuses them before our God day and night. / ��Or his Messiah ��Greek brothers
66Rv 12:11 And they have defeated him by the blood of the Lamb and by their testimony. And they did not love their lives so much that they were afraid to die.
66Rv 12:12 Therefore, rejoice, O heavens! And you who live in the heavens, rejoice! But terror will come on the earth and the sea, for the devil has come down to you in great anger, knowing that he has little time."
66Rv 12:13 When the dragon realized that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
66Rv 12:14 But she was given two wings like those of a great eagle so she could fly to the place prepared for her in the wilderness. There she would be cared for and protected from the dragon�� for a time, times, and half a time. / ��Greek the serpent; also in 12.15. See 12.9
66Rv 12:15 Then the dragon tried to drown the woman with a flood of water that flowed from his mouth.
66Rv 12:16 But the earth helped her by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that gushed out from the mouth of the dragon.
66Rv 12:17 And the dragon was angry at the woman and declared war against the rest of her children - all who keep God's commandments and maintain their testimony for Jesus.
66Rv 12:18 Then the dragon took his stand�� on the shore beside the sea. / ��Greek Then he took his stand; some manuscripts read Then I took my stand. Some translations put this entire sentence into 13.1
66Rv 13:1 Then I saw a beast rising up out of the sea. It had seven heads and ten horns, with ten crowns on its horns. And written on each head were names that blasphemed God.
66Rv 13:2 This beast looked like a leopard, but it had the feet of a bear and the mouth of a lion! And the dragon gave the beast his own power and throne and great authority.
66Rv 13:3 I saw that one of the heads of the beast seemed wounded beyond recovery - but the fatal wound was healed! The whole world marveled at this miracle and gave allegiance to the beast.
66Rv 13:4 They worshiped the dragon for giving the beast such power, and they also worshiped the beast. "Who is as great as the beast?" they exclaimed. "Who is able to fight against him?"
66Rv 13:5 Then the beast was allowed to speak great blasphemies against God. And he was given authority to do whatever he wanted for forty-two months.
66Rv 13:6 And he spoke terrible words of blasphemy against God, slandering his name and his dwelling - that is, those who dwell in heaven��. / ��Some manuscripts read and his dwelling and all who dwell in heaven
66Rv 13:7 And the beast was allowed to wage war against God's holy people and to conquer them. And he was given authority to rule over every tribe and people and language and nation.
66Rv 13:8 And all the people who belong to this world worshiped the beast. They are the ones whose names were not written in the Book of Life before the world was made - the Book that belongs to the Lamb who was slaughtered��. / ��Or not written in the Book of Life that belongs to the Lamb who was slaughtered before the world was made
66Rv 13:9 Anyone with ears to hear should listen and understand.
66Rv 13:10 Anyone who is destined for prison will be taken to prison. Anyone destined to die by the sword will die by the sword. This means that God's holy people must endure persecution patiently and remain faithful.
66Rv 13:11 Then I saw another beast come up out of the earth. He had two horns like those of a lamb, but he spoke with the voice of a dragon.
66Rv 13:12 He exercised all the authority of the first beast. And he required all the earth and its people to worship the first beast, whose fatal wound had been healed.
66Rv 13:13 He did astounding miracles, even making fire flash down to earth from the sky while everyone was watching.
66Rv 13:14 And with all the miracles he was allowed to perform on behalf of the first beast, he deceived all the people who belong to this world. He ordered the people to make a great statue of the first beast, who was fatally wounded and then came back to life.
66Rv 13:15 He was then permitted to give life to this statue so that it could speak. Then the statue of the beast commanded that anyone refusing to worship it must die.
66Rv 13:16 He required everyone - small and great, rich and poor, free and slave - to be given a mark on the right hand or on the forehead.
66Rv 13:17 And no one could buy or sell anything without that mark, which was either the name of the beast or the number representing his name.
66Rv 13:18 Wisdom is needed here. Let the one with understanding solve the meaning of the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man��. His number is 666��. / ��Or of humanity ��Some manuscripts read 616
66Rv 14:1 Then I saw the Lamb standing on Mount Zion, and with him were 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.
66Rv 14:2 And I heard a sound from heaven like the roar of mighty ocean waves or the rolling of loud thunder. It was like the sound of many harpists playing together.
66Rv 14:3 This great choir sang a wonderful new song in front of the throne of God and before the four living beings and the twenty-four elders. No one could learn this song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
66Rv 14:4 They have kept themselves as pure as virgins��, following the Lamb wherever he goes. They have been purchased from among the people on the earth as a special offering�� to God and to the Lamb. / ��Greek They are virgins who have not defiled themselves with women ��Greek as firstfruits
66Rv 14:5 They have told no lies; they are without blame.
66Rv 14:6 And I saw another angel flying through the sky, carrying the eternal Good News to proclaim to the people who belong to this world - to every nation, tribe, language, and people.
66Rv 14:7 "Fear God," he shouted. "Give glory to him. For the time has come when he will sit as judge. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea, and all the springs of water."
66Rv 14:8 Then another angel followed him through the sky, shouting, "Babylon is fallen - that great city is fallen - because she made all the nations of the world drink the wine of her passionate immorality."
66Rv 14:9 Then a third angel followed them, shouting, "Anyone who worships the beast and his statue or who accepts his mark on the forehead or on the hand
66Rv 14:10 must drink the wine of God's anger. It has been poured full strength into God's cup of wrath. And they will be tormented with fire and burning sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the Lamb.
66Rv 14:11 The smoke of their torment will rise forever and ever, and they will have no relief day or night, for they have worshiped the beast and his statue and have accepted the mark of his name."
66Rv 14:12 This means that God's holy people must endure persecution patiently, obeying his commands and maintaining their faith in Jesus.
66Rv 14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write this down�� Blessed are those who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, they are blessed indeed, for they will rest from their hard work; for their good deeds follow them!"
66Rv 14:14 Then I saw a white cloud, and seated on the cloud was someone like the Son of Man��. He had a gold crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand. / ��Or like a son of man. See Dan 7.13. "Son of Man" is a title Jesus used for himself
66Rv 14:15 Then another angel came from the Temple and shouted to the one sitting on the cloud, "Swing the sickle, for the time of harvest has come; the crop on earth is ripe."
66Rv 14:16 So the one sitting on the cloud swung his sickle over the earth, and the whole earth was harvested.
66Rv 14:17 After that, another angel came from the Temple in heaven, and he also had a sharp sickle.
66Rv 14:18 Then another angel, who had power to destroy with fire, came from the altar. He shouted to the angel with the sharp sickle, "Swing your sickle now to gather the clusters of grapes from the vines of the earth, for they are ripe for judgment."
66Rv 14:19 So the angel swung his sickle over the earth and loaded the grapes into the great winepress of God's wrath.
66Rv 14:20 The grapes were trampled in the winepress outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress in a stream about 180 miles�� long and as high as a horse's bridle. / ��Greek 1,600 stadia [296 kilometers]
66Rv 15:1 Then I saw in heaven another marvelous event of great significance. Seven angels were holding the seven last plagues, which would bring God's wrath to completion.
66Rv 15:2 I saw before me what seemed to be a glass sea mixed with fire. And on it stood all the people who had been victorious over the beast and his statue and the number representing his name. They were all holding harps that God had given them.
66Rv 15:3 And they were singing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb�� "Great and marvelous are your works, O Lord God, the Almighty. Just and true are your ways, O King of the nations��. / ��Some manuscripts read King of the ages
66Rv 15:4 Who will not fear you, Lord, and glorify your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship before you, for your righteous deeds have been revealed."
66Rv 15:5 Then I looked and saw that the Temple in heaven, God's Tabernacle, was thrown wide open.
66Rv 15:6 The seven angels who were holding the seven plagues came out of the Temple. They were clothed in spotless white linen�� with gold sashes across their chests. / ��Other manuscripts read white stone; still others read white [garments] made of linen
66Rv 15:7 Then one of the four living beings handed each of the seven angels a gold bowl filled with the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
66Rv 15:8 The Temple was filled with smoke from God's glory and power. No one could enter the Temple until the seven angels had completed pouring out the seven plagues.
66Rv 16:1 Then I heard a mighty voice from the Temple say to the seven angels, "Go your ways and pour out on the earth the seven bowls containing God's wrath."
66Rv 16:2 So the first angel left the Temple and poured out his bowl on the earth, and horrible, malignant sores broke out on everyone who had the mark of the beast and who worshiped his statue.
66Rv 16:3 Then the second angel poured out his bowl on the sea, and it became like the blood of a corpse. And everything in the sea died.
66Rv 16:4 Then the third angel poured out his bowl on the rivers and springs, and they became blood.
66Rv 16:5 And I heard the angel who had authority over all water saying, "You are just, O Holy One, who is and who always was, because you have sent these judgments.
66Rv 16:6 Since they shed the blood of your holy people and your prophets, you have given them blood to drink. It is their just reward."
66Rv 16:7 And I heard a voice from the altar��, saying, "Yes, O Lord God, the Almighty, your judgments are true and just." / ��Greek I heard the altar
66Rv 16:8 Then the fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, causing it to scorch everyone with its fire.
66Rv 16:9 Everyone was burned by this blast of heat, and they cursed the name of God, who had control over all these plagues. They did not repent of their sins and turn to God and give him glory.
66Rv 16:10 Then the fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and his kingdom was plunged into darkness. His subjects ground their teeth in anguish,
66Rv 16:11 and they cursed the God of heaven for their pains and sores. But they did not repent of their evil deeds and turn to God.
66Rv 16:12 Then the sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great Euphrates River, and it dried up so that the kings from the east could march their armies toward the west without hindrance.
66Rv 16:13 And I saw three evil�� spirits that looked like frogs leap from the mouths of the dragon, the beast, and the false prophet. / ��Greek unclean
66Rv 16:14 They are demonic spirits who work miracles and go out to all the rulers of the world to gather them for battle against the Lord on that great judgment day of God the Almighty.
66Rv 16:15 "Look, I will come as unexpectedly as a thief! Blessed are all who are watching for me, who keep their clothing ready so they will not have to walk around naked and ashamed."
66Rv 16:16 And the demonic spirits gathered all the rulers and their armies to a place with the Hebrew name Armageddon��. / ��Or Harmagedon
66Rv 16:17 Then the seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air. And a mighty shout came from the throne in the Temple, saying, "It is finished!"
66Rv 16:18 Then the thunder crashed and rolled, and lightning flashed. And a great earthquake struck - the worst since people were placed on the earth.
66Rv 16:19 The great city of Babylon split into three sections, and the cities of many nations fell into heaps of rubble. So God remembered all of Babylon's sins, and he made her drink the cup that was filled with the wine of his fierce wrath.
66Rv 16:20 And every island disappeared, and all the mountains were leveled.
66Rv 16:21 There was a terrible hailstorm, and hailstones weighing as much as seventy-five pounds�� fell from the sky onto the people below. They cursed God because of the terrible plague of the hailstorm. / ��Greek 1 talent [34 kilograms]
66Rv 17:1 One of the seven angels who had poured out the seven bowls came over and spoke to me. "Come with me," he said, "and I will show you the judgment that is going to come on the great prostitute, who rules over many waters.
66Rv 17:2 The kings of the world have committed adultery with her, and the people who belong to this world have been made drunk by the wine of her immorality."
66Rv 17:3 So the angel took me in the Spirit�� into the wilderness. There I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that had seven heads and ten horns, and blasphemies against God were written all over it. / ��Or in spirit
66Rv 17:4 The woman wore purple and scarlet clothing and beautiful jewelry made of gold and precious gems and pearls. In her hand she held a gold goblet full of obscenities and the impurities of her immorality.
66Rv 17:5 A mysterious name was written on her forehead�� "Babylon the Great, Mother of All Prostitutes and Obscenities in the World."
66Rv 17:6 I could see that she was drunk - drunk with the blood of God's holy people who were witnesses for Jesus. I stared at her in complete amazement.
66Rv 17:7 "Why are you so amazed?" the angel asked. "I will tell you the mystery of this woman and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns on which she sits.
66Rv 17:8 The beast you saw was once alive but isn't now. And yet he will soon come up out of the bottomless pit�� and go to eternal destruction. And the people who belong to this world, whose names were not written in the Book of Life before the world was made, will be amazed at the reappearance of this beast who had died. / ��Or the abyss, or the underworld
66Rv 17:9 "This calls for a mind with understanding�� The seven heads of the beast represent the seven hills where the woman rules. They also represent seven kings.
66Rv 17:10 Five kings have already fallen, the sixth now reigns, and the seventh is yet to come, but his reign will be brief.
66Rv 17:11 "The scarlet beast that was, but is no longer, is the eighth king. He is like the other seven, and he, too, is headed for destruction.
66Rv 17:12 The ten horns of the beast are ten kings who have not yet risen to power. They will be appointed to their kingdoms for one brief moment to reign with the beast.
66Rv 17:13 They will all agree to give him their power and authority.
66Rv 17:14 Together they will go to war against the Lamb, but the Lamb will defeat them because he is Lord of all lords and King of all kings. And his called and chosen and faithful ones will be with him."
66Rv 17:15 Then the angel said to me, "The waters where the prostitute is ruling represent masses of people of every nation and language.
66Rv 17:16 The scarlet beast and his ten horns all hate the prostitute. They will strip her naked, eat her flesh, and burn her remains with fire.
66Rv 17:17 For God has put a plan into their minds, a plan that will carry out his purposes. They will agree to give their authority to the scarlet beast, and so the words of God will be fulfilled.
66Rv 17:18 And this woman you saw in your vision represents the great city that rules over the kings of the world."
66Rv 18:1 After all this I saw another angel come down from heaven with great authority, and the earth grew bright with his splendor.
66Rv 18:2 He gave a mighty shout�� "Babylon is fallen - that great city is fallen! She has become a home for demons. She is a hideout for every foul�� spirit, a hideout for every foul vulture and every foul and dreadful animal��. / ��Greek unclean; also in each of the two following phrases ��Some manuscripts condense the last two lines to read a hideout for every foul [unclean] and dreadful vulture
66Rv 18:3 For all the nations have fallen�� because of the wine of her passionate immorality. The kings of the world have committed adultery with her. Because of her desires for extravagant luxury, the merchants of the world have grown rich." / ��Some manuscripts read have drunk
66Rv 18:4 Then I heard another voice calling from heaven, "Come away from her, my people. Do not take part in her sins, or you will be punished with her.
66Rv 18:5 For her sins are piled as high as heaven, and God remembers her evil deeds.
66Rv 18:6 Do to her as she has done to others.Double her penalty�� for all her evil deeds. She brewed a cup of terror for others, so brew twice as much��. / ��Or Give her an equal penalty ��Or brew just as much for her
66Rv 18:7 She glorified herself and lived in luxury, so match it now with torment and sorrow. She boasted in her heart, 'I am queen on my throne. I am no helpless widow, and I have no reason to mourn.'
66Rv 18:8 Therefore, these plagues will overtake her in a single day - death and mourning and famine. She will be completely consumed by fire, for the Lord God who judges her is mighty."
66Rv 18:9 And the kings of the world who committed adultery with her and enjoyed her great luxury will mourn for her as they see the smoke rising from her charred remains.
66Rv 18:10 They will stand at a distance, terrified by her great torment. They will cry out, "How terrible, how terrible for you, O Babylon, you great city! In a single moment God's judgment came on you."
66Rv 18:11 The merchants of the world will weep and mourn for her, for there is no one left to buy their goods.
66Rv 18:12 She bought great quantities of gold, silver, jewels, and pearls; fine linen, purple, silk, and scarlet cloth; things made of fragrant thyine wood, ivory goods, and objects made of expensive wood; and bronze, iron, and marble.
66Rv 18:13 She also bought cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, and bodies - that is, human slaves.
66Rv 18:14 "The fancy things you loved so much are gone," they cry. "All your luxuries and splendor are gone forever, never to be yours again."
66Rv 18:15 The merchants who became wealthy by selling her these things will stand at a distance, terrified by her great torment. They will weep and cry out,
66Rv 18:16 "How terrible, how terrible for that great city! She was clothed in finest purple and scarlet linens, decked out with gold and precious stones and pearls!
66Rv 18:17 In a single moment all the wealth of the city is gone!" And all the captains of the merchant ships and their passengers and sailors and crews will stand at a distance.
66Rv 18:18 They will cry out as they watch the smoke ascend, and they will say, "Where is there another city as great as this?"
66Rv 18:19 And they will weep and throw dust on their heads to show their grief. And they will cry out, "How terrible, how terrible for that great city! The shipowners became wealthy by transporting her great wealth on the seas. In a single moment it is all gone."
66Rv 18:20 Rejoice over her fate, O heaven and people of God and apostles and prophets! For at last God has judged her for your sakes.
66Rv 18:21 Then a mighty angel picked up a boulder the size of a huge millstone. He threw it into the ocean and shouted, "Just like this, the great city Babylon will be thrown down with violence and will never be found again.
66Rv 18:22 The sound of harps, singers, flutes, and trumpets will never be heard in you again. No craftsmen and no trades will ever be found in you again. The sound of the mill will never be heard in you again.
66Rv 18:23 The light of a lamp will never shine in you again. The happy voices of brides and grooms will never be heard in you again. For your merchants were the greatest in the world, and you deceived the nations with your sorceries.
66Rv 18:24 In your�� streets flowed the blood of the prophets and of God's holy people and the blood of people slaughtered all over the world." / ��Greek her
66Rv 19:1 After this, I heard what sounded like a vast crowd in heaven shouting, "Praise the LORD!�� Salvation and glory and power belong to our God. / ��Greek Hallelujah; also in 19.3, 4, 6. Hallelujah is the transliteration of a Hebrew term that means "Praise the LORD."
66Rv 19:2 His judgments are true and just. He has punished the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality. He has avenged the murder of his servants."
66Rv 19:3 And again their voices rang out�� "Praise the LORD! The smoke from that city ascends forever and ever!"
66Rv 19:4 Then the twenty-four elders and the four living beings fell down and worshiped God, who was sitting on the throne. They cried out, "Amen! Praise the LORD!"
66Rv 19:5 And from the throne came a voice that said, "Praise our God, all his servants, all who fear him, from the least to the greatest."
66Rv 19:6 Then I heard again what sounded like the shout of a vast crowd or the roar of mighty ocean waves or the crash of loud thunder�� "Praise the LORD! For the Lord our God��, the Almighty, reigns. / ��Some manuscripts read the Lord God
66Rv 19:7 Let us be glad and rejoice, and let us give honor to him. For the time has come for the wedding feast of the Lamb, and his bride has prepared herself.
66Rv 19:8 She has been given the finest of pure white linen to wear." For the fine linen represents the good deeds of God's holy people.
66Rv 19:9 And the angel said to me, "Write this�� Blessed are those who are invited to the wedding feast of the Lamb." And he added, These are true words that come from God."
66Rv 19:10 Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said, "No, don't worship me. I am a servant of God, just like you and your brothers and sisters�� who testify about their faith in Jesus. Worship only God. For the essence of prophecy is to give a clear witness for Jesus��." / ��Greek brothers ��Or is the message confirmed by Jesus
66Rv 19:11 Then I saw heaven opened, and a white horse was standing there. Its rider was named Faithful and True, for he judges fairly and wages a righteous war.
66Rv 19:12 His eyes were like flames of fire, and on his head were many crowns. A name was written on him that no one understood except himself.
66Rv 19:13 He wore a robe dipped in blood, and his title was the Word of God.
66Rv 19:14 The armies of heaven, dressed in the finest of pure white linen, followed him on white horses.
66Rv 19:15 From his mouth came a sharp sword to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod. He will release the fierce wrath of God, the Almighty, like juice flowing from a winepress.
66Rv 19:16 On his robe at his thigh�� was written this title�� King of all kings and Lord of all lords. / ��Or On his robe and thigh
66Rv 19:17 Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, shouting to the vultures flying high in the sky�� "Come! Gather together for the great banquet God has prepared.
66Rv 19:18 Come and eat the flesh of kings, generals, and strong warriors; of horses and their riders; and of all humanity, both free and slave, small and great."
66Rv 19:19 Then I saw the beast and the kings of the world and their armies gathered together to fight against the one sitting on the horse and his army.
66Rv 19:20 And the beast was captured, and with him the false prophet who did mighty miracles on behalf of the beast - miracles that deceived all who had accepted the mark of the beast and who worshiped his statue. Both the beast and his false prophet were thrown alive into the fiery lake of burning sulfur.
66Rv 19:21 Their entire army was killed by the sharp sword that came from the mouth of the one riding the white horse. And the vultures all gorged themselves on the dead bodies.
66Rv 20:1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven with the key to the bottomless pit�� and a heavy chain in his hand. / ��Or the abyss, or the underworld; also in 20.3
66Rv 20:2 He seized the dragon - that old serpent, who is the devil, Satan - and bound him in chains for a thousand years.
66Rv 20:3 The angel threw him into the bottomless pit, which he then shut and locked so Satan could not deceive the nations anymore until the thousand years were finished. Afterward he must be released for a little while.
66Rv 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and the people sitting on them had been given the authority to judge. And I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for their testimony about Jesus and for proclaiming the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or his statue, nor accepted his mark on their forehead or their hands. They all came to life again, and they reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
66Rv 20:5 This is the first resurrection. (The rest of the dead did not come back to life until the thousand years had ended.)
66Rv 20:6 Blessed and holy are those who share in the first resurrection. For them the second death holds no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ and will reign with him a thousand years.
66Rv 20:7 When the thousand years come to an end, Satan will be let out of his prison.
66Rv 20:8 He will go out to deceive the nations - called Gog and Magog - in every corner of the earth. He will gather them together for battle - a mighty army, as numberless as sand along the seashore.
66Rv 20:9 And I saw them as they went up on the broad plain of the earth and surrounded God's people and the beloved city. But fire from heaven came down on the attacking armies and consumed them.
66Rv 20:10 Then the devil, who had deceived them, was thrown into the fiery lake of burning sulfur, joining the beast and the false prophet. There they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
66Rv 20:11 And I saw a great white throne and the one sitting on it. The earth and sky fled from his presence, but they found no place to hide.
66Rv 20:12 I saw the dead, both great and small, standing before God's throne. And the books were opened, including the Book of Life. And the dead were judged according to what they had done, as recorded in the books.
66Rv 20:13 The sea gave up its dead, and death and the grave�� gave up their dead. And all were judged according to their deeds. / ��Greek and Hades; also in 20.14
66Rv 20:14 Then death and the grave were thrown into the lake of fire. This lake of fire is the second death.
66Rv 20:15 And anyone whose name was not found recorded in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of fire.
66Rv 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the old heaven and the old earth had disappeared. And the sea was also gone.
66Rv 21:2 And I saw the holy city, the new Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven like a bride beautifully dressed for her husband.
66Rv 21:3 I heard a loud shout from the throne, saying, "Look, God's home is now among his people! He will live with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them��. / ��Some manuscripts read God himself will be with them, their God
66Rv 21:4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes, and there will be no more death or sorrow or crying or pain. All these things are gone forever."
66Rv 21:5 And the one sitting on the throne said, "Look, I am making everything new!" And then he said to me, "Write this down, for what I tell you is trustworthy and true."
66Rv 21:6 And he also said, "It is finished! I am the Alpha and the Omega - the Beginning and the End. To all who are thirsty I will give freely from the springs of the water of life.
66Rv 21:7 All who are victorious will inherit all these blessings, and I will be their God, and they will be my children.
66Rv 21:8 "But cowards, unbelievers, the corrupt, murderers, the immoral, those who practice witchcraft, idol worshipers, and all liars - their fate is in the fiery lake of burning sulfur. This is the second death."
66Rv 21:9 Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls containing the seven last plagues came and said to me, "Come with me! I will show you the bride, the wife of the Lamb."
66Rv 21:10 So he took me in the Spirit�� to a great, high mountain, and he showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God. / ��Or in spirit
66Rv 21:11 It shone with the glory of God and sparkled like a precious stone - like jasper as clear as crystal.
66Rv 21:12 The city wall was broad and high, with twelve gates guarded by twelve angels. And the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were written on the gates.
66Rv 21:13 There were three gates on each side - east, north, south, and west.
66Rv 21:14 The wall of the city had twelve foundation stones, and on them were written the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
66Rv 21:15 The angel who talked to me held in his hand a gold measuring stick to measure the city, its gates, and its wall.
66Rv 21:16 When he measured it, he found it was a square, as wide as it was long. In fact, its length and width and height were each 1,400 miles��. / ��Greek 12,000 stadia [2,220 kilometers]
66Rv 21:17 Then he measured the walls and found them to be 216 feet thick�� (according to the human standard used by the angel). / ��Greek 144 cubits [65 meters]
66Rv 21:18 The wall was made of jasper, and the city was pure gold, as clear as glass.
66Rv 21:19 The wall of the city was built on foundation stones inlaid with twelve precious stones.�� the first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald, / ��The identification of some of these gemstones is uncertain
66Rv 21:20 the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.
66Rv 21:21 The twelve gates were made of pearls - each gate from a single pearl! And the main street was pure gold, as clear as glass.
66Rv 21:22 I saw no temple in the city, for the Lord God Almighty and the Lamb are its temple.
66Rv 21:23 And the city has no need of sun or moon, for the glory of God illuminates the city, and the Lamb is its light.
66Rv 21:24 The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the world will enter the city in all their glory.
66Rv 21:25 Its gates will never be closed at the end of day because there is no night there.
66Rv 21:26 And all the nations will bring their glory and honor into the city.
66Rv 21:27 Nothing evil�� will be allowed to enter, nor anyone who practices shameful idolatry and dishonesty - but only those whose names are written in the Lamb's Book of Life. / ��Or ceremonially unclean
66Rv 22:1 Then the angel showed me a river with the water of life, clear as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb.
66Rv 22:2 It flowed down the center of the main street. On each side of the river grew a tree of life, bearing twelve crops of fruit��, with a fresh crop each month. The leaves were used for medicine to heal the nations. / ��Or twelve kinds of fruit
66Rv 22:3 No longer will there be a curse upon anything. For the throne of God and of the Lamb will be there, and his servants will worship him.
66Rv 22:4 And they will see his face, and his name will be written on their foreheads.
66Rv 22:5 And there will be no night there - no need for lamps or sun - for the Lord God will shine on them. And they will reign forever and ever.
66Rv 22:6 Then the angel said to me, "Everything you have heard and seen is trustworthy and true. The Lord God, who inspires his prophets��, has sent his angel to tell his servants what will happen soon��." / ��Or The Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets ��Or suddenly, or quickly; also in 22.7, 12, 20
66Rv 22:7 "Look, I am coming soon! Blessed are those who obey the words of prophecy written in this book��." / ��Or scroll; also in 22.9, 10, 18, 19
66Rv 22:8 I, John, am the one who heard and saw all these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me.
66Rv 22:9 But he said, "No, don't worship me. I am a servant of God, just like you and your brothers the prophets, as well as all who obey what is written in this book. Worship only God!"
66Rv 22:10 Then he instructed me, "Do not seal up the prophetic words in this book, for the time is near.
66Rv 22:11 Let the one who is doing harm continue to do harm; let the one who is vile continue to be vile; let the one who is righteous continue to live righteously; let the one who is holy continue to be holy."
66Rv 22:12 "Look, I am coming soon, bringing my reward with me to repay all people according to their deeds.
66Rv 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End."
66Rv 22:14 Blessed are those who wash their robes. They will be permitted to enter through the gates of the city and eat the fruit from the tree of life.
66Rv 22:15 Outside the city are the dogs - the sorcerers, the sexually immoral, the murderers, the idol worshipers, and all who love to live a lie.
66Rv 22:16 "I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give you this message for the churches. I am both the source of David and the heir to his throne��. I am the bright morning star." / ��Greek I am the root and offspring of David
66Rv 22:17 The Spirit and the bride say, "Come." Let anyone who hears this say, "Come." Let anyone who is thirsty come. Let anyone who desires drink freely from the water of life.
66Rv 22:18 And I solemnly declare to everyone who hears the words of prophecy written in this book�� If anyone adds anything to what is written here, God will add to that person the plagues described in this book.
66Rv 22:19 And if anyone removes any of the words from this book of prophecy, God will remove that person's share in the tree of life and in the holy city that are described in this book.
66Rv 22:20 He who is the faithful witness to all these things says, "Yes, I am coming soon!" Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!
66Rv 22:21 May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with God's holy people��. / ��Other manuscripts read be with all; still others read be with all of God's holy people. Some manuscripts add Amen.
