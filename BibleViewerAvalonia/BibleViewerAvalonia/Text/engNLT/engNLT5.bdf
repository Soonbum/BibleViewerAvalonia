24Jr 1:1 These are the words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, one of the priests from the town of Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. 
24Jr 1:2 The Lord first gave messages to Jeremiah during the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon, king of Judah®Á. / ®ÁThe thirteenth year of Josiah°Øs reign was 627 b.c.
24Jr 1:3 The Lord°Øs messages continued throughout the reign of King Jehoiakim, Josiah°Øs son, until the eleventh year of the reign of King Zedekiah, another of Josiah°Øs sons. In August®Á of that eleventh year the people of Jerusalem were taken away as captives. / ®ÁHebrew In the fifth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. A number of events in Jeremiah can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Babylonian records and related accurately to our modern calendar. The fifth month in the eleventh year of Zedekiah°Øs reign occurred within the months of August and September 586 b.c. Also see 52.12 and the note there.
24Jr 1:4 The Lord gave me this message.
24Jr 1:5 °∞I knew you before I formed you in your mother°Øs womb. Before you were born I set you apart and appointed you as my prophet to the nations.°±
24Jr 1:6 °∞O Sovereign Lord,°± I said, °∞I can°Øt speak for you! I°Øm too young!°±
24Jr 1:7 The Lord replied, °∞Don°Øt say, °ÆI°Øm too young,°Ø for you must go wherever I send you and say whatever I tell you. 
24Jr 1:8 And don°Øt be afraid of the people, for I will be with you and will protect you. I, the Lord, have spoken!°± 
24Jr 1:9 Then the Lord reached out and touched my mouth and said, °∞Look, I have put my words in your mouth!
24Jr 1:10 Today I appoint you to stand up against nations and kingdoms. Some you must uproot and tear down, destroy and overthrow. Others you must build up and plant.°±
24Jr 1:11 Then the Lord said to me, °∞Look, Jeremiah! What do you see?°± And I replied, °∞I see a branch from an almond tree.°±
24Jr 1:12 And the Lord said, °∞That°Øs right, and it means that I am watching®Á, and I will certainly carry out all my plans.°± / ®ÁThe Hebrew word for °∞watching°± (shoqed) sounds like the word for °∞almond tree°± (shaqed).
24Jr 1:13 Then the Lord spoke to me again and asked, °∞What do you see now?°± And I replied, °∞I see a pot of boiling water, spilling from the north.°±
24Jr 1:14 °∞Yes,°± the Lord said, °∞for terror from the north will boil out on the people of this land. 
24Jr 1:15 Listen! I am calling the armies of the kingdoms of the north to come to Jerusalem. I, the Lord, have spoken! °∞They will set their thrones at the gates of the city. They will attack its walls and all the other towns of Judah.
24Jr 1:16 I will pronounce judgment on my people for all their evil - for deserting me and burning incense to other gods. Yes, they worship idols made with their own hands!
24Jr 1:17 °∞Get up and prepare for action. Go out and tell them everything I tell you to say. Do not be afraid of them, or I will make you look foolish in front of them.
24Jr 1:18 For see, today I have made you strong like a fortified city that cannot be captured, like an iron pillar or a bronze wall. You will stand against the whole land - the kings, officials, priests, and people of Judah.
24Jr 1:19 They will fight you, but they will fail. For I am with you, and I will take care of you. I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
24Jr 2:1 The Lord gave me another message. He said, 
24Jr 2:2 °∞Go and shout this message to Jerusalem. This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞I remember how eager you were to please me as a young bride long ago, how you loved me and followed me even through the barren wilderness.
24Jr 2:3 In those days Israel was holy to the Lord, the first of his children®Á. All who harmed his people were declared guilty, and disaster fell on them. I, the Lord, have spoken!°± / ®ÁHebrew the firstfruits of his harvest.
24Jr 2:4 Listen to the word of the Lord, people of Jacob - all you families of Israel! 
24Jr 2:5 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞What did your ancestors find wrong with me that led them to stray so far from me? They worshiped worthless idols, only to become worthless themselves.
24Jr 2:6 They did not ask, °ÆWhere is the Lord who brought us safely out of Egypt and led us through the barren wilderness - a land of deserts and pits, a land of drought and death, where no one lives or even travels?°Ø
24Jr 2:7 °∞And when I brought you into a fruitful land to enjoy its bounty and goodness, you defiled my land and corrupted the possession I had promised you.
24Jr 2:8 The priests did not ask, °ÆWhere is the Lord?°Ø Those who taught my word ignored me, the rulers turned against me, and the prophets spoke in the name of Baal, wasting their time on worthless idols.
24Jr 2:9 Therefore, I will bring my case against you,°± says the Lord. °∞I will even bring charges against your children°Øs children in the years to come.
24Jr 2:10 °∞Go west and look in the land of Cyprus®Á; go east and search through the land of Kedar. Has anyone ever heard of anything as strange as this? / ®ÁHebrew Kittim.
24Jr 2:11 Has any nation ever traded its gods for new ones, even though they are not gods at all? Yet my people have exchanged their glorious God®Á for worthless idols! / ®ÁHebrew their glory.
24Jr 2:12 The heavens are shocked at such a thing and shrink back in horror and dismay,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 2:13 °∞For my people have done two evil things£∫ They have abandoned me - the fountain of living water. And they have dug for themselves cracked cisterns that can hold no water at all!
24Jr 2:14 °∞Why has Israel become a slave? Why has he been carried away as plunder?
24Jr 2:15 Strong lions have roared against him, and the land has been destroyed. The towns are now in ruins, and no one lives in them anymore.
24Jr 2:16 Egyptians, marching from their cities of Memphis®Á and Tahpanhes, have destroyed Israel°Øs glory and power. / ®ÁHebrew Noph.
24Jr 2:17 And you have brought this upon yourselves by rebelling against the Lord your God, even though he was leading you on the way!
24Jr 2:18 °∞What have you gained by your alliances with Egypt and your covenants with Assyria? What good to you are the streams of the Nile®Á or the waters of the Euphrates River?®Ë / ®ÁHebrew of Shihor, a branch of the Nile River. ®ËHebrew the river?
24Jr 2:19 Your wickedness will bring its own punishment. Your turning from me will shame you. You will see what an evil, bitter thing it is to abandon the Lord your God and not to fear him. I, the Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, have spoken!
24Jr 2:20 °∞Long ago I broke the yoke that oppressed you and tore away the chains of your slavery, but still you said, °ÆI will not serve you.°Ø On every hill and under every green tree, you have prostituted yourselves by bowing down to idols.
24Jr 2:21 But I was the one who planted you, choosing a vine of the purest stock - the very best. How did you grow into this corrupt wild vine?
24Jr 2:22 No amount of soap or lye can make you clean. I still see the stain of your guilt. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!
24Jr 2:23 °∞You say, °ÆThat°Ønot true! I haven°Øt worshiped the images of Baal!°Ø But how can you say that? Go and look in any valley in the land! Face the awful sins you have done. You are like a restless female camel desperately searching for a mate.
24Jr 2:24 You are like a wild donkey, sniffing the wind at mating time. Who can restrain her lust? Those who desire her don°Øt need to search, for she goes running to them!
24Jr 2:25 When will you stop running? When will you stop panting after other gods? But you say, °ÆSave your breath. I°Øm in love with these foreign gods, and I can°Øt stop loving them now!°Ø
24Jr 2:26 °∞Israel is like a thief who feels shame only when he gets caught. They, their kings, officials, priests, and prophets - all are alike in this.
24Jr 2:27 To an image carved from a piece of wood they say, °ÆYou are my father.°Ø To an idol chiseled from a block of stone they say, °ÆYou are my mother.°Ø They turn their backs on me, but in times of trouble they cry out to me, °ÆCome and save us!°Ø
24Jr 2:28 But why not call on these gods you have made? When trouble comes, let them save you if they can! For you have as many gods as there are towns in Judah.
24Jr 2:29 Why do you accuse me of doing wrong? You are the ones who have rebelled,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 2:30 °∞I have punished your children, but they did not respond to my discipline. You yourselves have killed your prophets as a lion kills its prey.
24Jr 2:31 °∞O my people, listen to the words of the Lord! Have I been like a desert to Israel? Have I been to them a land of darkness? Why then do my people say, °ÆAt last we are free from God! We don°Øt need him anymore!°Ø
24Jr 2:32 Does a young woman forget her jewelry? Does a bride hide her wedding dress? Yet for years on end my people have forgotten me.
24Jr 2:33 °∞How you plot and scheme to win your lovers. Even an experienced prostitute could learn from you!
24Jr 2:34 Your clothing is stained with the blood of the innocent and the poor, though you didn°Øt catch them breaking into your houses!
24Jr 2:35 And yet you say, °ÆI have done nothing wrong. Surely God isn°Øt angry with me!°Ø But now I will punish you severely because you claim you have not sinned.
24Jr 2:36 First here, then there - you flit from one ally to another asking for help. But your new friends in Egypt will let you down, just as Assyria did before.
24Jr 2:37 In despair, you will be led into exile with your hands on your heads, for the Lord has rejected the nations you trust. They will not help you at all.
24Jr 3:1 °∞If a man divorces a woman and she goes and marries someone else, he will not take her back again, for that would surely corrupt the land. But you have prostituted yourself with many lovers, so why are you trying to come back to me?°± says the Lord.
24Jr 3:2 °∞Look at the shrines on every hilltop. Is there any place you have not been defiled by your adultery with other gods? You sit like a prostitute beside the road waiting for a customer. You sit alone like a nomad in the desert. You have polluted the land with your prostitution and your wickedness.
24Jr 3:3 That°Øs why even the spring rains have failed. For you are a brazen prostitute and completely shameless.
24Jr 3:4 Yet you say to me, °ÆFather, you have been my guide since my youth.
24Jr 3:5 Surely you won°Øt be angry forever! Surely you can forget about it!°Ø So you talk, but you keep on doing all the evil you can.°±
24Jr 3:6 During the reign of King Josiah, the Lord said to me, °∞Have you seen what fickle Israel has done? Like a wife who commits adultery, Israel has worshiped other gods on every hill and under every green tree. 
24Jr 3:7 I thought, °ÆAfter she has done all this, she will return to me.°Ø But she did not return, and her faithless sister Judah saw this. 
24Jr 3:8 She saw that I divorced faithless Israel because of her adultery. But that treacherous sister Judah had no fear, and now she, too, has left me and given herself to prostitution. 
24Jr 3:9 Israel treated it all so lightly - she thought nothing of committing adultery by worshiping idols made of wood and stone. So now the land has been polluted. 
24Jr 3:10 But despite all this, her faithless sister Judah has never sincerely returned to me. She has only pretended to be sorry. I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
24Jr 3:11 Then the Lord said to me, °∞Even faithless Israel is less guilty than treacherous Judah! 
24Jr 3:12 Therefore, go and give this message to Israel®Á. This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞O Israel, my faithless people, come home to me again, for I am merciful. I will not be angry with you forever. / ®ÁHebrew toward the north.
24Jr 3:13 Only acknowledge your guilt. Admit that you rebelled against the Lord your God and committed adultery against him by worshiping idols under every green tree. Confess that you refused to listen to my voice. I, the Lord, have spoken!
24Jr 3:14 °∞Return home, you wayward children,°± says the Lord, °∞for I am your master. I will bring you back to the land of Israel®Á - one from this town and two from that family - from wherever you are scattered. / ®ÁHebrew to Zion.
24Jr 3:15 And I will give you shepherds after my own heart, who will guide you with knowledge and understanding.
24Jr 3:16 °∞And when your land is once more filled with people,°± says the Lord, °∞you will no longer wish for °Æthe good old days°Ø when you possessed the Ark of the Lord°Øs Covenant. You will not miss those days or even remember them, and there will be no need to rebuild the Ark. 
24Jr 3:17 In that day Jerusalem will be known as °ÆThe Throne of the Lord.°Ø All nations will come there to honor the Lord. They will no longer stubbornly follow their own evil desires. 
24Jr 3:18 In those days the people of Judah and Israel will return together from exile in the north. They will return to the land I gave their ancestors as an inheritance forever.
24Jr 3:19 °∞I thought to myself, °ÆI would love to treat you as my own children!°Ø I wanted nothing more than to give you this beautiful land - the finest possession in the world. I looked forward to your calling me °ÆFather,°Ø and I wanted you never to turn from me.
24Jr 3:20 But you have been unfaithful to me, you people of Israel! You have been like a faithless wife who leaves her husband. I, the Lord, have spoken.°±
24Jr 3:21 Voices are heard high on the windswept mountains, the weeping and pleading of Israel°Øs people. For they have chosen crooked paths and have forgotten the Lord their God.
24Jr 3:22 °∞My wayward children,°± says the Lord, °∞come back to me, and I will heal your wayward hearts.°± °∞Yes, we°Øre coming,°± the people reply, °∞for you are the Lord our God.
24Jr 3:23 Our worship of idols on the hills and our religious orgies on the mountains are a delusion. Only in the Lord our God will Israel ever find salvation.
24Jr 3:24 From childhood we have watched as everything our ancestors worked for - their flocks and herds, their sons and daughters - was squandered on a delusion.
24Jr 3:25 Let us now lie down in shame and cover ourselves with dishonor, for we and our ancestors have sinned against the Lord our God. From our childhood to this day we have never obeyed him.°±
24Jr 4:1 °∞O Israel,°± says the Lord, °∞if you wanted to return to me, you could. You could throw away your detestable idols and stray away no more.
24Jr 4:2 Then when you swear by my name, saying, °ÆAs surely as the Lord lives,°Ø you could do so with truth, justice, and righteousness. Then you would be a blessing to the nations of the world, and all people would come and praise my name.°±
24Jr 4:3 This is what the Lord says to the people of Judah and Jerusalem£∫ °∞Plow up the hard ground of your hearts! Do not waste your good seed among thorns.
24Jr 4:4 O people of Judah and Jerusalem, surrender your pride and power. Change your hearts before the Lord®Á, or my anger will burn like an unquenchable fire because of all your sins. / ®ÁHebrew Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of your heart.
24Jr 4:5 °∞Shout to Judah, and broadcast to Jerusalem! Tell them to sound the alarm throughout the land£∫ °ÆRun for your lives! Flee to the fortified cities!°Ø
24Jr 4:6 Raise a signal flag as a warning for Jerusalem®Á£∫ °ÆFlee now! Do not delay!°Ø For I am bringing terrible destruction upon you from the north.°± / ®ÁHebrew Zion.
24Jr 4:7 A lion stalks from its den, a destroyer of nations. It has left its lair and is headed your way. It°Øs going to devastate your land! Your towns will lie in ruins, with no one living in them anymore.
24Jr 4:8 So put on clothes of mourning and weep with broken hearts, for the fierce anger of the Lord is still upon us.
24Jr 4:9 °∞In that day,°± says the Lord, °∞the king and the officials will tremble in fear. The priests will be struck with horror, and the prophets will be appalled.°±
24Jr 4:10 Then I said, °∞O Sovereign Lord, the people have been deceived by what you said, for you promised peace for Jerusalem. But the sword is held at their throats!°±
24Jr 4:11 The time is coming when the Lord will say to the people of Jerusalem, °∞My dear people, a burning wind is blowing in from the desert, and it°Øs not a gentle breeze useful for winnowing grain.
24Jr 4:12 It is a roaring blast sent by me! Now I will pronounce your destruction!°±
24Jr 4:13 Our enemy rushes down on us like storm clouds! His chariots are like whirlwinds. His horses are swifter than eagles. How terrible it will be, for we are doomed!
24Jr 4:14 O Jerusalem, cleanse your heart that you may be saved. How long will you harbor your evil thoughts?
24Jr 4:15 Your destruction has been announced from Dan and the hill country of Ephraim.
24Jr 4:16 °∞Warn the surrounding nations and announce this to Jerusalem£∫ The enemy is coming from a distant land, raising a battle cry against the towns of Judah.
24Jr 4:17 They surround Jerusalem like watchmen around a field, for my people have rebelled against me,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 4:18 °∞Your own actions have brought this upon you. This punishment is bitter, piercing you to the heart!°±
24Jr 4:19 My heart, my heart - I writhe in pain! My heart pounds within me! I cannot be still. For I have heard the blast of enemy trumpets and the roar of their battle cries.
24Jr 4:20 Waves of destruction roll over the land, until it lies in complete desolation. Suddenly my tents are destroyed; in a moment my shelters are crushed.
24Jr 4:21 How long must I see the battle flags and hear the trumpets of war?
24Jr 4:22 °∞My people are foolish and do not know me,°± says the Lord. °∞They are stupid children who have no understanding. They are clever enough at doing wrong, but they have no idea how to do right!°±
24Jr 4:23 I looked at the earth, and it was empty and formless. I looked at the heavens, and there was no light.
24Jr 4:24 I looked at the mountains and hills, and they trembled and shook.
24Jr 4:25 I looked, and all the people were gone. All the birds of the sky had flown away.
24Jr 4:26 I looked, and the fertile fields had become a wilderness. The towns lay in ruins, crushed by the Lord°Øs fierce anger.
24Jr 4:27 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞The whole land will be ruined, but I will not destroy it completely.
24Jr 4:28 The earth will mourn and the heavens will be draped in black because of my decree against my people. I have made up my mind and will not change it.°±
24Jr 4:29 At the noise of charioteers and archers, the people flee in terror. They hide in the bushes and run for the mountains. All the towns have been abandoned - not a person remains!
24Jr 4:30 What are you doing, you who have been plundered? Why do you dress up in beautiful clothing and put on gold jewelry? Why do you brighten your eyes with mascara? Your primping will do you no good! The allies who were your lovers despise you and seek to kill you.
24Jr 4:31 I hear a cry, like that of a woman in labor, the groans of a woman giving birth to her first child. It is beautiful Jerusalem®Á gasping for breath and crying out, °∞Help! I°Øm being murdered!°± / ®ÁHebrew the daughter of Zion.
24Jr 5:1 °∞Run up and down every street in Jerusalem,°± says the Lord. °∞Look high and low; search throughout the city! If you can find even one just and honest person, I will not destroy the city.
24Jr 5:2 But even when they are under oath, saying, °ÆAs surely as the Lord lives,°Ø they are still telling lies!°±
24Jr 5:3 Lord, you are searching for honesty. You struck your people, but they paid no attention. You crushed them, but they refused to be corrected. They are determined, with faces set like stone; they have refused to repent.
24Jr 5:4 Then I said, °∞But what can we expect from the poor? They are ignorant. They don°Øt know the ways of the Lord. They don°Øt understand God°Øs laws.
24Jr 5:5 So I will go and speak to their leaders. Surely they know the ways of the Lord and understand God°Øs laws.°± But the leaders, too, as one man, had thrown off God°Øs yoke and broken his chains.
24Jr 5:6 So now a lion from the forest will attack them; a wolf from the desert will pounce on them. A leopard will lurk near their towns, tearing apart any who dare to venture out. For their rebellion is great, and their sins are many.
24Jr 5:7 °∞How can I pardon you? For even your children have turned from me. They have sworn by gods that are not gods at all! I fed my people until they were full. But they thanked me by committing adultery and lining up at the brothels.
24Jr 5:8 They are well-fed, lusty stallions, each neighing for his neighbor°Øs wife.
24Jr 5:9 Should I not punish them for this?°± says the Lord. °∞Should I not avenge myself against such a nation?
24Jr 5:10 °∞Go down the rows of the vineyards and destroy the grapevines, leaving a scattered few alive. Strip the branches from the vines, for these people do not belong to the Lord.
24Jr 5:11 The people of Israel and Judah are full of treachery against me,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 5:12 °∞They have lied about the Lord and said, °ÆHe won°Øt bother us! No disasters will come upon us. There will be no war or famine.
24Jr 5:13 God°Øs prophets are all windbags who don°Øt really speak for him. Let their predictions of disaster fall on themselves!°Ø°±
24Jr 5:14 Therefore, this is what the Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ °∞Because the people are talking like this, my messages will flame out of your mouth and burn the people like kindling wood.
24Jr 5:15 O Israel, I will bring a distant nation against you,°± says the Lord. °∞It is a mighty nation, an ancient nation, a people whose language you do not know, whose speech you cannot understand.
24Jr 5:16 Their weapons are deadly; their warriors are mighty.
24Jr 5:17 They will devour the food of your harvest; they will devour your sons and daughters. They will devour your flocks and herds; they will devour your grapes and figs. And they will destroy your fortified towns, which you think are so safe.
24Jr 5:18 °∞Yet even in those days I will not blot you out completely,°± says the Lord. 
24Jr 5:19 °∞And when your people ask, °ÆWhy did the Lord our God do all this to us?°Ø you must reply, °ÆYou rejected him and gave yourselves to foreign gods in your own land. Now you will serve foreigners in a land that is not your own.°Ø
24Jr 5:20 °∞Make this announcement to Israel®Á, and say this to Judah£∫ / ®ÁHebrew to the house of Jacob. The names °∞Jacob°± and °∞Israel°± are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation.
24Jr 5:21 Listen, you foolish and senseless people, with eyes that do not see and ears that do not hear.
24Jr 5:22 Have you no respect for me? Why don°Øt you tremble in my presence? I, the Lord, define the ocean°Øs sandy shoreline as an everlasting boundary that the waters cannot cross. The waves may toss and roar, but they can never pass the boundaries I set.
24Jr 5:23 But my people have stubborn and rebellious hearts. They have turned away and abandoned me.
24Jr 5:24 They do not say from the heart, °ÆLet us live in awe of the Lord our God, for he gives us rain each spring and fall, assuring us of a harvest when the time is right.°Ø
24Jr 5:25 Your wickedness has deprived you of these wonderful blessings. Your sin has robbed you of all these good things.
24Jr 5:26 °∞Among my people are wicked men who lie in wait for victims like a hunter hiding in a blind. They continually set traps to catch people.
24Jr 5:27 Like a cage filled with birds, their homes are filled with evil plots. And now they are great and rich.
24Jr 5:28 They are fat and sleek, and there is no limit to their wicked deeds. They refuse to provide justice to orphans and deny the rights of the poor.
24Jr 5:29 Should I not punish them for this?°± says the Lord. °∞Should I not avenge myself against such a nation?
24Jr 5:30 A horrible and shocking thing has happened in this land - 
24Jr 5:31 the prophets give false prophecies, and the priests rule with an iron hand. Worse yet, my people like it that way! But what will you do when the end comes?
24Jr 6:1 °∞Run for your lives, you people of Benjamin! Get out of Jerusalem! Sound the alarm in Tekoa! Send up a signal at Beth-hakkerem! A powerful army is coming from the north, coming with disaster and destruction.
24Jr 6:2 O Jerusalem®Á, you are my beautiful and delicate daughter - but I will destroy you! / ®ÁHebrew Daughter of Zion.
24Jr 6:3 Enemies will surround you, like shepherds camped around the city. Each chooses a place for his troops to devour.
24Jr 6:4 They shout, °ÆPrepare for battle! Attack at noon!°Ø °ÆNo, it°Øs too late; the day is fading, and the evening shadows are falling.°Ø
24Jr 6:5 °ÆWell then, let°Øs attack at night and destroy her palaces!°Ø°±
24Jr 6:6 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ °∞Cut down the trees for battering rams. Build siege ramps against the walls of Jerusalem. This is the city to be punished, for she is wicked through and through.
24Jr 6:7 She spouts evil like a fountain. Her streets echo with the sounds of violence and destruction. I always see her sickness and sores.
24Jr 6:8 Listen to this warning, Jerusalem, or I will turn from you in disgust. Listen, or I will turn you into a heap of ruins, a land where no one lives.°±
24Jr 6:9 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ °∞Even the few who remain in Israel will be picked over again, as when a harvester checks each vine a second time to pick the grapes that were missed.°±
24Jr 6:10 To whom can I give warning? Who will listen when I speak? Their ears are closed, and they cannot hear. They scorn the word of the Lord. They don°Øt want to listen at all.
24Jr 6:11 So now I am filled with the Lord°Øs fury. Yes, I am tired of holding it in! °∞I will pour out my fury on children playing in the streets and on gatherings of young men, on husbands and wives and on those who are old and gray.
24Jr 6:12 Their homes will be turned over to their enemies, as will their fields and their wives. For I will raise my powerful fist against the people of this land,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 6:13 °∞From the least to the greatest, their lives are ruled by greed. From prophets to priests, they are all frauds.
24Jr 6:14 They offer superficial treatments for my people°Øs mortal wound. They give assurances of peace when there is no peace.
24Jr 6:15 Are they ashamed of their disgusting actions? Not at all - they don°Øt even know how to blush! Therefore, they will lie among the slaughtered. They will be brought down when I punish them,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 6:16 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Stop at the crossroads and look around. Ask for the old, godly way, and walk in it. Travel its path, and you will find rest for your souls. But you reply, °ÆNo, that°Øs not the road we want!°Ø
24Jr 6:17 I posted watchmen over you who said, °ÆListen for the sound of the alarm.°Ø But you replied, °ÆNo! We won°Øt pay attention!°Ø
24Jr 6:18 °∞Therefore, listen to this, all you nations. Take note of my people°Øs situation.
24Jr 6:19 Listen, all the earth! I will bring disaster on my people. It is the fruit of their own schemes, because they refuse to listen to me. They have rejected my word.
24Jr 6:20 There°Øs no use offering me sweet frankincense from Sheba. Keep your fragrant calamus imported from distant lands! I will not accept your burnt offerings. Your sacrifices have no pleasing aroma for me.°±
24Jr 6:21 Therefore, this is what the Lord says£∫ °∞I will put obstacles in my people°Øs path. Fathers and sons will both fall over them. Neighbors and friends will die together.°±
24Jr 6:22 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Look! A great army coming from the north! A great nation is rising against you from far-off lands.
24Jr 6:23 They are armed with bows and spears. They are cruel and show no mercy. They sound like a roaring sea as they ride forward on horses. They are coming in battle formation, planning to destroy you, beautiful Jerusalem®Á.°± / ®ÁHebrew daughter of Zion.
24Jr 6:24 We have heard reports about the enemy, and we wring our hands in fright. Pangs of anguish have gripped us, like those of a woman in labor.
24Jr 6:25 Don°Øt go out to the fields! Don°Øt travel on the roads! The enemy°Øs sword is everywhere and terrorizes us at every turn!
24Jr 6:26 Oh, my people, dress yourselves in burlap and sit among the ashes. Mourn and weep bitterly, as for the loss of an only son. For suddenly the destroying armies will be upon you!
24Jr 6:27 °∞Jeremiah, I have made you a tester of metals®Á, that you may determine the quality of my people. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads of metals in my people a fortress.
24Jr 6:28 They are the worst kind of rebel, full of slander. They are as hard as bronze and iron, and they lead others into corruption.
24Jr 6:29 The bellows fiercely fan the flames to burn out the corruption. But it does not purify them, for the wickedness remains.
24Jr 6:30 I will label them °ÆRejected Silver,°Ø for I, the Lord, am discarding them.°±
24Jr 7:1 The Lord gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, 
24Jr 7:2 °∞Go to the entrance of the Lord°Øs Temple, and give this message to the people£∫ °ÆO Judah, listen to this message from the Lord! Listen to it, all of you who worship here! 
24Jr 7:3 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °∞°ÆEven now, if you quit your evil ways, I will let you stay in your own land. 
24Jr 7:4 But don°Øt be fooled by those who promise you safety simply because the Lord°Øs Temple is here. They chant, °∞The Lord°Øs Temple is here! The Lord°Øs Temple is here!°± 
24Jr 7:5 But I will be merciful only if you stop your evil thoughts and deeds and start treating each other with justice; 
24Jr 7:6 only if you stop exploiting foreigners, orphans, and widows; only if you stop your murdering; and only if you stop harming yourselves by worshiping idols. 
24Jr 7:7 Then I will let you stay in this land that I gave to your ancestors to keep forever.
24Jr 7:8 °∞°ÆDon°Øt be fooled into thinking that you will never suffer because the Temple is here. It°Øs a lie! 
24Jr 7:9 Do you really think you can steal, murder, commit adultery, lie, and burn incense to Baal and all those other new gods of yours, 
24Jr 7:10 and then come here and stand before me in my Temple and chant, °∞We are safe!°± - only to go right back to all those evils again? 
24Jr 7:11 Don°Øt you yourselves admit that this Temple, which bears my name, has become a den of thieves? Surely I see all the evil going on there. I, the Lord, have spoken!
24Jr 7:12 °∞°ÆGo now to the place at Shiloh where I once put the Tabernacle that bore my name. See what I did there because of all the wickedness of my people, the Israelites. 
24Jr 7:13 While you were doing these wicked things, says the Lord, I spoke to you about it repeatedly, but you would not listen. I called out to you, but you refused to answer. 
24Jr 7:14 So just as I destroyed Shiloh, I will now destroy this Temple that bears my name, this Temple that you trust in for help, this place that I gave to you and your ancestors. 
24Jr 7:15 And I will send you out of my sight into exile, just as I did your relatives, the people of Israel®Á.°Ø / ®ÁHebrew of Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel.
24Jr 7:16 °∞Pray no more for these people, Jeremiah. Do not weep or pray for them, and don°Øt beg me to help them, for I will not listen to you. 
24Jr 7:17 Don°Øt you see what they are doing throughout the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
24Jr 7:18 No wonder I am so angry! Watch how the children gather wood and the fathers build sacrificial fires. See how the women knead dough and make cakes to offer to the Queen of Heaven. And they pour out liquid offerings to their other idol gods! 
24Jr 7:19 Am I the one they are hurting?°± asks the Lord. °∞Most of all, they hurt themselves, to their own shame.°±
24Jr 7:20 So this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ °∞I will pour out my terrible fury on this place. Its people, animals, trees, and crops will be consumed by the unquenchable fire of my anger.°±
24Jr 7:21 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °∞Take your burnt offerings and your other sacrifices and eat them yourselves! 
24Jr 7:22 When I led your ancestors out of Egypt, it was not burnt offerings and sacrifices I wanted from them. 
24Jr 7:23 This is what I told them£∫ °ÆObey me, and I will be your God, and you will be my people. Do everything as I say, and all will be well!°Ø
24Jr 7:24 °∞But my people would not listen to me. They kept doing whatever they wanted, following the stubborn desires of their evil hearts. They went backward instead of forward. 
24Jr 7:25 From the day your ancestors left Egypt until now, I have continued to send my servants, the prophets - day in and day out. 
24Jr 7:26 But my people have not listened to me or even tried to hear. They have been stubborn and sinful - even worse than their ancestors.
24Jr 7:27 °∞Tell them all this, but do not expect them to listen. Shout out your warnings, but do not expect them to respond. 
24Jr 7:28 Say to them, °ÆThis is the nation whose people will not obey the Lord their God and who refuse to be taught. Truth has vanished from among them; it is no longer heard on their lips. 
24Jr 7:29 Shave your head in mourning, and weep alone on the mountains. For the Lord has rejected and forsaken this generation that has provoked his fury.°Ø
24Jr 7:30 °∞The people of Judah have sinned before my very eyes,°± says the Lord. °∞They have set up their abominable idols right in the Temple that bears my name, defiling it. 
24Jr 7:31 They have built pagan shrines at Topheth, the garbage dump in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, and there they burn their sons and daughters in the fire. I have never commanded such a horrible deed; it never even crossed my mind to command such a thing! 
24Jr 7:32 So beware, for the time is coming,°± says the Lord, °∞when that garbage dump will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. They will bury the bodies in Topheth until there is no more room for them. 
24Jr 7:33 The bodies of my people will be food for the vultures and wild animals, and no one will be left to scare them away. 
24Jr 7:34 I will put an end to the happy singing and laughter in the streets of Jerusalem. The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will no longer be heard in the towns of Judah. The land will lie in complete desolation.
24Jr 8:1 °∞In that day,°± says the Lord, °∞the enemy will break open the graves of the kings and officials of Judah, and the graves of the priests, prophets, and common people of Jerusalem. 
24Jr 8:2 They will spread out their bones on the ground before the sun, moon, and stars - the gods my people have loved, served, and worshiped. Their bones will not be gathered up again or buried but will be scattered on the ground like manure. 
24Jr 8:3 And the people of this evil nation who survive will wish to die rather than live where I will send them. I, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, have spoken!
24Jr 8:4 °∞Jeremiah, say to the people, °ÆThis is what the Lord says£∫ °∞°ÆWhen people fall down, don°Øt they get up again? When they discover they°Øre on the wrong road, don°Øt they turn back?
24Jr 8:5 Then why do these people stay on their self-destructive path? Why do the people of Jerusalem refuse to turn back? They cling tightly to their lies and will not turn around.
24Jr 8:6 I listen to their conversations and don°Øt hear a word of truth. Is anyone sorry for doing wrong? Does anyone say, °∞What a terrible thing I have done°±? No! All are running down the path of sin as swiftly as a horse galloping into battle!
24Jr 8:7 Even the stork that flies across the sky knows the time of her migration, as do the turtledove, the swallow, and the crane®Á. They all return at the proper time each year. But not my people! They do not know the Lord°Øs laws. / ®ÁThe identification of some of these birds is uncertain.
24Jr 8:8 °∞°ÆHow can you say, °∞We are wise because we have the word of the Lord,°± when your teachers have twisted it by writing lies?
24Jr 8:9 These wise teachers will fall into the trap of their own foolishness, for they have rejected the word of the Lord. Are they so wise after all?
24Jr 8:10 I will give their wives to others and their farms to strangers. From the least to the greatest, their lives are ruled by greed. Yes, even my prophets and priests are like that. They are all frauds.
24Jr 8:11 They offer superficial treatments for my people°Øs mortal wound. They give assurances of peace when there is no peace.
24Jr 8:12 Are they ashamed of these disgusting actions? Not at all - they don°Øt even know how to blush! Therefore, they will lie among the slaughtered. They will be brought down when I punish them, says the Lord.
24Jr 8:13 I will surely consume them. There will be no more harvests of figs and grapes. Their fruit trees will all die. Whatever I gave them will soon be gone. I, the Lord, have spoken!°Ø
24Jr 8:14 °∞Then the people will say, °ÆWhy should we wait here to die? Come, let°Øs go to the fortified towns and die there. For the Lord our God has decreed our destruction and has given us a cup of poison to drink because we sinned against the Lord.
24Jr 8:15 We hoped for peace, but no peace came. We hoped for a time of healing, but found only terror.°Ø
24Jr 8:16 °∞The snorting of the enemies°Ø warhorses can be heard all the way from the land of Dan in the north! The neighing of their stallions makes the whole land tremble. They are coming to devour the land and everything in it - cities and people alike.
24Jr 8:17 I will send these enemy troops among you like poisonous snakes you cannot charm. They will bite you, and you will die. I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
24Jr 8:18 My grief is beyond healing; my heart is broken.
24Jr 8:19 Listen to the weeping of my people; it can be heard all across the land. °∞Has the Lord abandoned Jerusalem?®Á°± the people ask. °∞Is her King no longer there?°± °∞Oh, why have they provoked my anger with their carved idols and their worthless foreign gods?°± says the Lord. / ®ÁHebrew Zion?
24Jr 8:20 °∞The harvest is finished, and the summer is gone,°± the people cry, °∞yet we are not saved!°±
24Jr 8:21 I hurt with the hurt of my people. I mourn and am overcome with grief.
24Jr 8:22 Is there no medicine in Gilead? Is there no physician there? Why is there no healing for the wounds of my people?
24Jr 9:1 ®ÁIf only my head were a pool of water and my eyes a fountain of tears, I would weep day and night for all my people who have been slaughtered. / ®ÁVerse 9.1 is numbered 8.23 in Hebrew text.
24Jr 9:2 ®ÁOh, that I could go away and forget my people and live in a travelers°Ø shack in the desert. For they are all adulterers - a pack of treacherous liars. / ®ÁVerses 9.2-26 are numbered 9.1-25 in Hebrew text.
24Jr 9:3 °∞My people bend their tongues like bows to shoot out lies. They refuse to stand up for the truth. They only go from bad to worse. They do not know me,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 9:4 °∞Beware of your neighbor! Don°Øt even trust your brother! For brother takes advantage of brother, and friend slanders friend.
24Jr 9:5 They all fool and defraud each other; no one tells the truth. With practiced tongues they tell lies; they wear themselves out with all their sinning.
24Jr 9:6 They pile lie upon lie and utterly refuse to acknowledge me,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 9:7 Therefore, this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ °∞See, I will melt them down in a crucible and test them like metal. What else can I do with my people?®Á / ®ÁHebrew with the daughter of my people? Greek version reads with the evil daughter of my people?
24Jr 9:8 For their tongues shoot lies like poisoned arrows. They speak friendly words to their neighbors while scheming in their heart to kill them.
24Jr 9:9 Should I not punish them for this?°± says the Lord. °∞Should I not avenge myself against such a nation?°±
24Jr 9:10 I will weep for the mountains and wail for the wilderness pastures. For they are desolate and empty of life; the lowing of cattle is heard no more; the birds and wild animals have all fled.
24Jr 9:11 °∞I will make Jerusalem into a heap of ruins,°± says the Lord. °∞It will be a place haunted by jackals. The towns of Judah will be ghost towns, with no one living in them.°±
24Jr 9:12 Who is wise enough to understand all this? Who has been instructed by the Lord and can explain it to others? Why has the land been so ruined that no one dares to travel through it?
24Jr 9:13 The Lord replies, °∞This has happened because my people have abandoned my instructions; they have refused to obey what I said. 
24Jr 9:14 Instead, they have stubbornly followed their own desires and worshiped the images of Baal, as their ancestors taught them. 
24Jr 9:15 So now, this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ Look! I will feed them with bitterness and give them poison to drink. 
24Jr 9:16 I will scatter them around the world, in places they and their ancestors never heard of, and even there I will chase them with the sword until I have destroyed them completely.°±
24Jr 9:17 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ °∞Consider all this, and call for the mourners. Send for the women who mourn at funerals.
24Jr 9:18 Quick! Begin your weeping! Let the tears flow from your eyes.
24Jr 9:19 Hear the people of Jerusalem®Á crying in despair, °ÆWe are ruined! We are completely humiliated! We must leave our land, because our homes have been torn down.°Ø°± / ®ÁHebrew Zion.
24Jr 9:20 Listen, you women, to the words of the Lord; open your ears to what he has to say. Teach your daughters to wail; teach one another how to lament.
24Jr 9:21 For death has crept in through our windows and has entered our mansions. It has killed off the flower of our youth£∫ Children no longer play in the streets, and young men no longer gather in the squares.
24Jr 9:22 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Bodies will be scattered across the fields like clumps of manure, like bundles of grain after the harvest. No one will be left to bury them.°±
24Jr 9:23 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Don°Øt let the wise boast in their wisdom, or the powerful boast in their power, or the rich boast in their riches.
24Jr 9:24 But those who wish to boast should boast in this alone£∫ that they truly know me and understand that I am the Lord who demonstrates unfailing love and who brings justice and righteousness to the earth, and that I delight in these things. I, the Lord, have spoken!
24Jr 9:25 °∞A time is coming,°± says the Lord, °∞when I will punish all those who are circumcised in body but not in spirit - 
24Jr 9:26 the Egyptians, Edomites, Ammonites, Moabites, the people who live in the desert in remote places®Á, and yes, even the people of Judah. And like all these pagan nations, the people of Israel also have uncircumcised hearts.°± / ®ÁOr in the desert and clip the corners of their hair.
24Jr 10:1 Hear the word that the Lord speaks to you, O Israel! 
24Jr 10:2 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Do not act like the other nations, who try to read their future in the stars. Do not be afraid of their predictions, even though other nations are terrified by them.
24Jr 10:3 Their ways are futile and foolish. They cut down a tree, and a craftsman carves an idol.
24Jr 10:4 They decorate it with gold and silver and then fasten it securely with hammer and nails so it won°Øt fall over.
24Jr 10:5 Their gods are like helpless scarecrows in a cucumber field! They cannot speak, and they need to be carried because they cannot walk. Do not be afraid of such gods, for they can neither harm you nor do you any good.°±
24Jr 10:6 Lord, there is no one like you! For you are great, and your name is full of power.
24Jr 10:7 Who would not fear you, O King of nations? That title belongs to you alone! Among all the wise people of the earth and in all the kingdoms of the world, there is no one like you.
24Jr 10:8 People who worship idols are stupid and foolish. The things they worship are made of wood!
24Jr 10:9 They bring beaten sheets of silver from Tarshish and gold from Uphaz, and they give these materials to skillful craftsmen who make their idols. Then they dress these gods in royal blue and purple robes made by expert tailors.
24Jr 10:10 But the Lord is the only true God. He is the living God and the everlasting King! The whole earth trembles at his anger. The nations cannot stand up to his wrath.
24Jr 10:11 Say this to those who worship other gods£∫ °∞Your so-called gods, who did not make the heavens and earth, will vanish from the earth and from under the heavens.°±®Á / ®ÁThe original text of this verse is in Aramaic.
24Jr 10:12 But God made the earth by his power, and he preserves it by his wisdom. With his own understanding he stretched out the heavens.
24Jr 10:13 When he speaks in the thunder, the heavens roar with rain. He causes the clouds to rise over the earth. He sends the lightning with the rain and releases the wind from his storehouses.
24Jr 10:14 The whole human race is foolish and has no knowledge! The craftsmen are disgraced by the idols they make, for their carefully shaped works are a fraud. These idols have no breath or power.
24Jr 10:15 Idols are worthless; they are ridiculous lies! On the day of reckoning they will all be destroyed.
24Jr 10:16 But the God of Israel®Á is no idol! He is the Creator of everything that exists, including Israel, his own special possession. The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies is his name! / ®ÁHebrew the Portion of Jacob. See note on 5.20.
24Jr 10:17 Pack your bags and prepare to leave; the siege is about to begin.
24Jr 10:18 For this is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Suddenly, I will fling out all you who live in this land. I will pour great troubles upon you, and at last you will feel my anger.°±
24Jr 10:19 My wound is severe, and my grief is great. My sickness is incurable, but I must bear it.
24Jr 10:20 My home is gone, and no one is left to help me rebuild it. My children have been taken away, and I will never see them again.
24Jr 10:21 The shepherds of my people have lost their senses. They no longer seek wisdom from the Lord. Therefore, they fail completely, and their flocks are scattered.
24Jr 10:22 Listen! Hear the terrifying roar of great armies as they roll down from the north. The towns of Judah will be destroyed and become a haunt for jackals.
24Jr 10:23 I know, Lord, that our lives are not our own. We are not able to plan our own course.
24Jr 10:24 So correct me, Lord, but please be gentle. Do not correct me in anger, for I would die.
24Jr 10:25 Pour out your wrath on the nations that refuse to acknowledge you - on the peoples that do not call upon your name. For they have devoured your people Israel®Á; they have devoured and consumed them, making the land a desolate wilderness. / ®ÁHebrew devoured Jacob. See note on 5.20.
24Jr 11:1 The Lord gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, 
24Jr 11:2 °∞Remind the people of Judah and Jerusalem about the terms of my covenant with them. 
24Jr 11:3 Say to them, °ÆThis is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says£∫ Cursed is anyone who does not obey the terms of my covenant! 
24Jr 11:4 For I said to your ancestors when I brought them out of the iron-smelting furnace of Egypt, °∞If you obey me and do whatever I command you, then you will be my people, and I will be your God.°± 
24Jr 11:5 I said this so I could keep my promise to your ancestors to give you a land flowing with milk and honey - the land you live in today.°Ø°± Then I replied, °∞Amen, Lord! May it be so.°±
24Jr 11:6 Then the Lord said, °∞Broadcast this message in the streets of Jerusalem. Go from town to town throughout the land and say, °ÆRemember the ancient covenant, and do everything it requires. 
24Jr 11:7 For I solemnly warned your ancestors when I brought them out of Egypt, °∞Obey me!°± I have repeated this warning over and over to this day, 
24Jr 11:8 but your ancestors did not listen or even pay attention. Instead, they stubbornly followed their own evil desires. And because they refused to obey, I brought upon them all the curses described in this covenant.°Ø°±
24Jr 11:9 Again the Lord spoke to me and said, °∞I have discovered a conspiracy against me among the people of Judah and Jerusalem. 
24Jr 11:10 They have returned to the sins of their forefathers. They have refused to listen to me and are worshiping other gods. Israel and Judah have both broken the covenant I made with their ancestors. 
24Jr 11:11 Therefore, this is what the Lord says£∫ I am going to bring calamity upon them, and they will not escape. Though they beg for mercy, I will not listen to their cries. 
24Jr 11:12 Then the people of Judah and Jerusalem will pray to their idols and burn incense before them. But the idols will not save them when disaster strikes! 
24Jr 11:13 Look now, people of Judah; you have as many gods as you have towns. You have as many altars of shame - altars for burning incense to your god Baal - as there are streets in Jerusalem.
24Jr 11:14 °∞Pray no more for these people, Jeremiah. Do not weep or pray for them, for I will not listen to them when they cry out to me in distress.
24Jr 11:15 °∞What right do my beloved people have to come to my Temple, when they have done so many immoral things? Can their vows and sacrifices prevent their destruction? They actually rejoice in doing evil!
24Jr 11:16 I, the Lord, once called them a thriving olive tree, beautiful to see and full of good fruit. But now I have sent the fury of their enemies to burn them with fire, leaving them charred and broken.
24Jr 11:17 °∞I, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, who planted this olive tree, have ordered it destroyed. For the people of Israel and Judah have done evil, arousing my anger by burning incense to Baal.°±
24Jr 11:18 Then the Lord told me about the plots my enemies were making against me. 
24Jr 11:19 I was like a lamb being led to the slaughter. I had no idea that they were planning to kill me! °∞Let°Øs destroy this man and all his words,°± they said. °∞Let°Øs cut him down, so his name will be forgotten forever.°±
24Jr 11:20 O Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, you make righteous judgments, and you examine the deepest thoughts and secrets. Let me see your vengeance against them, for I have committed my cause to you.
24Jr 11:21 This is what the Lord says about the men of Anathoth who wanted me dead. They had said, °∞We will kill you if you do not stop prophesying in the Lord°Øs name.°± 
24Jr 11:22 So this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says about them£∫ °∞I will punish them! Their young men will die in battle, and their boys and girls will starve to death. 
24Jr 11:23 Not one of these plotters from Anathoth will survive, for I will bring disaster upon them when their time of punishment comes.°±
24Jr 12:1 Lord, you always give me justice when I bring a case before you. So let me bring you this complaint£∫ Why are the wicked so prosperous? Why are evil people so happy?
24Jr 12:2 You have planted them, and they have taken root and prospered. Your name is on their lips, but you are far from their hearts.
24Jr 12:3 But as for me, Lord, you know my heart. You see me and test my thoughts. Drag these people away like sheep to be butchered! Set them aside to be slaughtered!
24Jr 12:4 How long must this land mourn? Even the grass in the fields has withered. The wild animals and birds have disappeared because of the evil in the land. For the people have said, °∞The Lord doesn°Øt see what°Øs ahead for us!°±
24Jr 12:5 °∞If racing against mere men makes you tired, how will you race against horses? If you stumble and fall on open ground, what will you do in the thickets near the Jordan?
24Jr 12:6 Even your brothers, members of your own family, have turned against you. They plot and raise complaints against you. Do not trust them, no matter how pleasantly they speak.
24Jr 12:7 °∞I have abandoned my people, my special possession. I have surrendered my dearest ones to their enemies.
24Jr 12:8 My chosen people have roared at me like a lion of the forest, so I have treated them with contempt.
24Jr 12:9 My chosen people act like speckled vultures®Á, but they themselves are surrounded by vultures. Bring on the wild animals to pick their corpses clean! / ®ÁOr speckled hyenas.
24Jr 12:10 °∞Many rulers have ravaged my vineyard, trampling down the vines and turning all its beauty into a barren wilderness.
24Jr 12:11 They have made it an empty wasteland; I hear its mournful cry. The whole land is desolate, and no one even cares.
24Jr 12:12 On all the bare hilltops, destroying armies can be seen. The sword of the Lord devours people from one end of the nation to the other. No one will escape!
24Jr 12:13 My people have planted wheat but are harvesting thorns. They have worn themselves out, but it has done them no good. They will harvest a crop of shame because of the fierce anger of the Lord.°±
24Jr 12:14 Now this is what the Lord says£∫ °∞I will uproot from their land all the evil nations reaching out for the possession I gave my people Israel. And I will uproot Judah from among them. 
24Jr 12:15 But afterward I will return and have compassion on all of them. I will bring them home to their own lands again, each nation to its own possession. 
24Jr 12:16 And if these nations truly learn the ways of my people, and if they learn to swear by my name, saying, °ÆAs surely as the Lord lives°Ø (just as they taught my people to swear by the name of Baal), then they will be given a place among my people. 
24Jr 12:17 But any nation who refuses to obey me will be uprooted and destroyed. I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
24Jr 13:1 This is what the Lord said to me£∫ °∞Go and buy a linen loincloth and put it on, but do not wash it.°± 
24Jr 13:2 So I bought the loincloth as the Lord directed me, and I put it on.
24Jr 13:3 Then the Lord gave me another message£∫ 
24Jr 13:4 °∞Take the linen loincloth you are wearing, and go to the Euphrates River®Á. Hide it there in a hole in the rocks.°± / ®ÁHebrew Perath; also in 13.5, 6, 7.
24Jr 13:5 So I went and hid it by the Euphrates as the Lord had instructed me.
24Jr 13:6 A long time afterward the Lord said to me, °∞Go back to the Euphrates and get the loincloth I told you to hide there.°± 
24Jr 13:7 So I went to the Euphrates and dug it out of the hole where I had hidden it. But now it was rotting and falling apart. The loincloth was good for nothing.
24Jr 13:8 Then I received this message from the Lord£∫ 
24Jr 13:9 °∞This is what the Lord says£∫ This shows how I will rot away the pride of Judah and Jerusalem. 
24Jr 13:10 These wicked people refuse to listen to me. They stubbornly follow their own desires and worship other gods. Therefore, they will become like this loincloth - good for nothing! 
24Jr 13:11 As a loincloth clings to a man°Øs waist, so I created Judah and Israel to cling to me, says the Lord. They were to be my people, my pride, my glory - an honor to my name. But they would not listen to me.
24Jr 13:12 °∞So tell them, °ÆThis is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says£∫ May all your jars be filled with wine.°Ø And they will reply, °ÆOf course! Jars are made to be filled with wine!°Ø
24Jr 13:13 °∞Then tell them, °ÆNo, this is what the Lord means£∫ I will fill everyone in this land with drunkenness - from the king sitting on David°Øs throne to the priests and the prophets, right down to the common people of Jerusalem. 
24Jr 13:14 I will smash them against each other, even parents against children, says the Lord. I will not let my pity or mercy or compassion keep me from destroying them.°Ø°±
24Jr 13:15 Listen and pay attention! Do not be arrogant, for the Lord has spoken.
24Jr 13:16 Give glory to the Lord your God before it is too late. Acknowledge him before he brings darkness upon you, causing you to stumble and fall on the darkening mountains. For then, when you look for light, you will find only terrible darkness and gloom.
24Jr 13:17 And if you still refuse to listen, I will weep alone because of your pride. My eyes will overflow with tears, because the Lord°Øs flock will be led away into exile.
24Jr 13:18 Say to the king and his mother, °∞Come down from your thrones and sit in the dust, for your glorious crowns will soon be snatched from your heads.°±
24Jr 13:19 The towns of the Negev will close their gates, and no one will be able to open them. The people of Judah will be taken away as captives. All will be carried into exile.
24Jr 13:20 Open up your eyes and see the armies marching down from the north! Where is your flock - your beautiful flock - that he gave you to care for?
24Jr 13:21 What will you say when the Lord takes the allies you have cultivated and appoints them as your rulers? Pangs of anguish will grip you, like those of a woman in labor!
24Jr 13:22 You may ask yourself, °∞Why is all this happening to me?°± It is because of your many sins! That is why you have been stripped and raped by invading armies.
24Jr 13:23 Can an Ethiopian®Á change the color of his skin? Can a leopard take away its spots? Neither can you start doing good, for you have always done evil. / ®ÁHebrew a Cushite.
24Jr 13:24 °∞I will scatter you like chaff that is blown away by the desert winds.
24Jr 13:25 This is your allotment, the portion I have assigned to you,°± says the Lord, °∞for you have forgotten me, putting your trust in false gods.
24Jr 13:26 I myself will strip you and expose you to shame.
24Jr 13:27 I have seen your adultery and lust, and your disgusting idol worship out in the fields and on the hills. What sorrow awaits you, Jerusalem! How long before you are pure?°±
24Jr 14:1 This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord, explaining why he was holding back the rain.
24Jr 14:2 °∞Judah wilts; commerce at the city gates grinds to a halt. All the people sit on the ground in mourning, and a great cry rises from Jerusalem.
24Jr 14:3 The nobles send servants to get water, but all the wells are dry. The servants return with empty pitchers, confused and desperate, covering their heads in grief.
24Jr 14:4 The ground is parched and cracked for lack of rain. The farmers are deeply troubled; they, too, cover their heads.
24Jr 14:5 Even the doe abandons her newborn fawn because there is no grass in the field.
24Jr 14:6 The wild donkeys stand on the bare hills panting like thirsty jackals. They strain their eyes looking for grass, but there is none to be found.°±
24Jr 14:7 The people say, °∞Our wickedness has caught up with us, Lord, but help us for the sake of your own reputation. We have turned away from you and sinned against you again and again.
24Jr 14:8 O Hope of Israel, our Savior in times of trouble, why are you like a stranger to us? Why are you like a traveler passing through the land, stopping only for the night?
24Jr 14:9 Are you also confused? Is our champion helpless to save us? You are right here among us, Lord. We are known as your people. Please don°Øt abandon us now!°±
24Jr 14:10 So this is what the Lord says to his people£∫ °∞You love to wander far from me and do not restrain yourselves. Therefore, I will no longer accept you as my people. Now I will remember all your wickedness and will punish you for your sins.°±
24Jr 14:11 Then the Lord said to me, °∞Do not pray for these people anymore. 
24Jr 14:12 When they fast, I will pay no attention. When they present their burnt offerings and grain offerings to me, I will not accept them. Instead, I will devour them with war, famine, and disease.°±
24Jr 14:13 Then I said, °∞O Sovereign Lord, their prophets are telling them, °ÆAll is well - no war or famine will come. The Lord will surely send you peace.°Ø°±
24Jr 14:14 Then the Lord said, °∞These prophets are telling lies in my name. I did not send them or tell them to speak. I did not give them any messages. They prophesy of visions and revelations they have never seen or heard. They speak foolishness made up in their own lying hearts. 
24Jr 14:15 Therefore, this is what the Lord says£∫ I will punish these lying prophets, for they have spoken in my name even though I never sent them. They say that no war or famine will come, but they themselves will die by war and famine! 
24Jr 14:16 As for the people to whom they prophesy - their bodies will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem, victims of famine and war. There will be no one left to bury them. Husbands, wives, sons, and daughters - all will be gone. For I will pour out their own wickedness on them. 
24Jr 14:17 Now, Jeremiah, say this to them£∫ °∞Night and day my eyes overflow with tears. I cannot stop weeping, for my virgin daughter - my precious people - has been struck down and lies mortally wounded.
24Jr 14:18 If I go out into the fields, I see the bodies of people slaughtered by the enemy. If I walk the city streets, I see people who have died of starvation. The prophets and priests continue with their work, but they don°Øt know what they°Øre doing.°±
24Jr 14:19 Lord, have you completely rejected Judah? Do you really hate Jerusalem?®Á Why have you wounded us past all hope of healing? We hoped for peace, but no peace came. We hoped for a time of healing, but found only terror. / ®ÁHebrew Zion?
24Jr 14:20 Lord, we confess our wickedness and that of our ancestors, too. We all have sinned against you.
24Jr 14:21 For the sake of your reputation, Lord, do not abandon us. Do not disgrace your own glorious throne. Please remember us, and do not break your covenant with us.
24Jr 14:22 Can any of the worthless foreign gods send us rain? Does it fall from the sky by itself? No, you are the one, O Lord our God! Only you can do such things. So we will wait for you to help us.
24Jr 15:1 Then the Lord said to me, °∞Even if Moses and Samuel stood before me pleading for these people, I wouldn°Øt help them. Away with them! Get them out of my sight! 
24Jr 15:2 And if they say to you, °ÆBut where can we go?°Ø tell them, °ÆThis is what the Lord says£∫ °∞°ÆThose who are destined for death, to death; those who are destined for war, to war; those who are destined for famine, to famine; those who are destined for captivity, to captivity.°Ø
24Jr 15:3 °∞I will send four kinds of destroyers against them,°± says the Lord. °∞I will send the sword to kill, the dogs to drag away, the vultures to devour, and the wild animals to finish up what is left. 
24Jr 15:4 Because of the wicked things Manasseh son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem, I will make my people an object of horror to all the kingdoms of the earth.
24Jr 15:5 °∞Who will feel sorry for you, Jerusalem? Who will weep for you? Who will even bother to ask how you are?
24Jr 15:6 You have abandoned me and turned your back on me,°± says the Lord. °∞Therefore, I will raise my fist to destroy you. I am tired of always giving you another chance.
24Jr 15:7 I will winnow you like grain at the gates of your cities and take away the children you hold dear. I will destroy my own people, because they refuse to change their evil ways.
24Jr 15:8 There will be more widows than the grains of sand on the seashore. At noontime I will bring a destroyer against the mothers of young men. I will cause anguish and terror to come upon them suddenly.
24Jr 15:9 The mother of seven grows faint and gasps for breath; her sun has gone down while it is still day. She sits childless now, disgraced and humiliated. And I will hand over those who are left to be killed by the enemy. I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
24Jr 15:10 Then I said, °∞What sorrow is mine, my mother. Oh, that I had died at birth! I am hated everywhere I go. I am neither a lender who threatens to foreclose nor a borrower who refuses to pay - yet they all curse me.°±
24Jr 15:11 The Lord replied, °∞I will take care of you, Jeremiah. Your enemies will ask you to plead on their behalf in times of trouble and distress.
24Jr 15:12 Can a man break a bar of iron from the north, or a bar of bronze?
24Jr 15:13 At no cost to them, I will hand over your wealth and treasures as plunder to your enemies, for sin runs rampant in your land.
24Jr 15:14 I will tell your enemies to take you as captives to a foreign land. For my anger blazes like a fire that will burn forever®Á.°± / ®ÁAs in some Hebrew manuscripts (see also 17.4); most Hebrew manuscripts read will burn against you.
24Jr 15:15 Then I said, °∞Lord, you know what°Øs happening to me. Please step in and help me. Punish my persecutors! Please give me time; don°Øt let me die young. It°Øs for your sake that I am suffering.
24Jr 15:16 When I discovered your words, I devoured them. They are my joy and my heart°Øs delight, for I bear your name, O Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies.
24Jr 15:17 I never joined the people in their merry feasts. I sat alone because your hand was on me. I was filled with indignation at their sins.
24Jr 15:18 Why then does my suffering continue? Why is my wound so incurable? Your help seems as uncertain as a seasonal brook, like a spring that has gone dry.°±
24Jr 15:19 This is how the Lord responds£∫ °∞If you return to me, I will restore you so you can continue to serve me. If you speak good words rather than worthless ones, you will be my spokesman. You must influence them; do not let them influence you!
24Jr 15:20 They will fight against you like an attacking army, but I will make you as secure as a fortified wall of bronze. They will not conquer you, for I am with you to protect and rescue you. I, the Lord, have spoken!
24Jr 15:21 Yes, I will certainly keep you safe from these wicked men. I will rescue you from their cruel hands.°±
24Jr 16:1 The Lord gave me another message. He said, 
24Jr 16:2 °∞Do not get married or have children in this place. 
24Jr 16:3 For this is what the Lord says about the children born here in this city and about their mothers and fathers£∫ 
24Jr 16:4 They will die from terrible diseases. No one will mourn for them or bury them, and they will lie scattered on the ground like manure. They will die from war and famine, and their bodies will be food for the vultures and wild animals.°±
24Jr 16:5 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Do not go to funerals to mourn and show sympathy for these people, for I have removed my protection and peace from them. I have taken away my unfailing love and my mercy. 
24Jr 16:6 Both the great and the lowly will die in this land. No one will bury them or mourn for them. Their friends will not cut themselves in sorrow or shave their heads in sadness. 
24Jr 16:7 No one will offer a meal to comfort those who mourn for the dead - not even at the death of a mother or father. No one will send a cup of wine to console them.
24Jr 16:8 °∞And do not go to their feasts and parties. Do not eat and drink with them at all. 
24Jr 16:9 For this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ In your own lifetime, before your very eyes, I will put an end to the happy singing and laughter in this land. The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will no longer be heard.
24Jr 16:10 °∞When you tell the people all these things, they will ask, °ÆWhy has the Lord decreed such terrible things against us? What have we done to deserve such treatment? What is our sin against the Lord our God?°Ø
24Jr 16:11 °∞Then you will give them the Lord°Øs reply£∫ °ÆIt is because your ancestors were unfaithful to me. They worshiped other gods and served them. They abandoned me and did not obey my word. 
24Jr 16:12 And you are even worse than your ancestors! You stubbornly follow your own evil desires and refuse to listen to me. 
24Jr 16:13 So I will throw you out of this land and send you into a foreign land where you and your ancestors have never been. There you can worship idols day and night - and I will grant you no favors!°Ø
24Jr 16:14 °∞But the time is coming,°± says the Lord, °∞when people who are taking an oath will no longer say, °ÆAs surely as the Lord lives, who rescued the people of Israel from the land of Egypt.°Ø 
24Jr 16:15 Instead, they will say, °ÆAs surely as the Lord lives, who brought the people of Israel back to their own land from the land of the north and from all the countries to which he had exiled them.°Ø For I will bring them back to this land that I gave their ancestors.
24Jr 16:16 °∞But now I am sending for many fishermen who will catch them,°± says the Lord. °∞I am sending for hunters who will hunt them down in the mountains, hills, and caves. 
24Jr 16:17 I am watching them closely, and I see every sin. They cannot hope to hide from me. 
24Jr 16:18 I will double their punishment for all their sins, because they have defiled my land with lifeless images of their detestable gods and have filled my territory with their evil deeds.°±
24Jr 16:19 Lord, you are my strength and fortress, my refuge in the day of trouble! Nations from around the world will come to you and say, °∞Our ancestors left us a foolish heritage, for they worshiped worthless idols.
24Jr 16:20 Can people make their own gods? These are not real gods at all!°±
24Jr 16:21 The Lord says, °∞Now I will show them my power; now I will show them my might. At last they will know and understand that I am the Lord.
24Jr 17:1 °∞The sin of Judah is inscribed with an iron chisel - engraved with a diamond point on their stony hearts and on the corners of their altars.
24Jr 17:2 Even their children go to worship at their pagan altars and Asherah poles, beneath every green tree and on every high hill.
24Jr 17:3 So I will hand over my holy mountain - along with all your wealth and treasures and your pagan shrines - as plunder to your enemies, for sin runs rampant in your land.
24Jr 17:4 The wonderful possession I have reserved for you will slip from your hands. I will tell your enemies to take you as captives to a foreign land. For my anger blazes like a fire that will burn forever.°±isdom from the Lord
24Jr 17:5 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Cursed are those who put their trust in mere humans, who rely on human strength and turn their hearts away from the Lord.
24Jr 17:6 They are like stunted shrubs in the desert, with no hope for the future. They will live in the barren wilderness, in an uninhabited salty land.
24Jr 17:7 °∞But blessed are those who trust in the Lord and have made the Lord their hope and confidence.
24Jr 17:8 They are like trees planted along a riverbank, with roots that reach deep into the water. Such trees are not bothered by the heat or worried by long months of drought. Their leaves stay green, and they never stop producing fruit.
24Jr 17:9 °∞The human heart is the most deceitful of all things, and desperately wicked. Who really knows how bad it is?
24Jr 17:10 But I, the Lord, search all hearts and examine secret motives. I give all people their due rewards, according to what their actions deserve.°±
24Jr 17:11 Like a partridge that hatches eggs she has not laid, so are those who get their wealth by unjust means. At midlife they will lose their riches; in the end, they will become poor old fools.
24Jr 17:12 But we worship at your throne - eternal, high, and glorious!
24Jr 17:13 O Lord, the hope of Israel, all who turn away from you will be disgraced. They will be buried in the dust of the earth, for they have abandoned the Lord, the fountain of living water.
24Jr 17:14 O Lord, if you heal me, I will be truly healed; if you save me, I will be truly saved. My praises are for you alone!
24Jr 17:15 People scoff at me and say, °∞What is this °Æmessage from the Lord°Ø you talk about? Why don°Øt your predictions come true?°±
24Jr 17:16 Lord, I have not abandoned my job as a shepherd for your people. I have not urged you to send disaster. You have heard everything I°Øve said.
24Jr 17:17 Lord, don°Øt terrorize me! You alone are my hope in the day of disaster.
24Jr 17:18 Bring shame and dismay on all who persecute me, but don°Øt let me experience shame and dismay. Bring a day of terror on them. Yes, bring double destruction upon them!
24Jr 17:19 This is what the Lord said to me£∫ °∞Go and stand in the gates of Jerusalem, first in the gate where the king goes in and out, and then in each of the other gates. 
24Jr 17:20 Say to all the people, °ÆListen to this message from the Lord, you kings of Judah and all you people of Judah and everyone living in Jerusalem. 
24Jr 17:21 This is what the Lord says£∫ Listen to my warning! Stop carrying on your trade at Jerusalem°Øs gates on the Sabbath day. 
24Jr 17:22 Do not do your work on the Sabbath, but make it a holy day. I gave this command to your ancestors, 
24Jr 17:23 but they did not listen or obey. They stubbornly refused to pay attention or accept my discipline.
24Jr 17:24 °∞°ÆBut if you obey me, says the Lord, and do not carry on your trade at the gates or work on the Sabbath day, and if you keep it holy, 
24Jr 17:25 then kings and their officials will go in and out of these gates forever. There will always be a descendant of David sitting on the throne here in Jerusalem. Kings and their officials will always ride in and out among the people of Judah in chariots and on horses, and this city will remain forever. 
24Jr 17:26 And from all around Jerusalem, from the towns of Judah and Benjamin, from the western foothills®Á and the hill country and the Negev, the people will come with their burnt offerings and sacrifices. They will bring their grain offerings, frankincense, and thanksgiving offerings to the Lord°Øs Temple. / ®ÁHebrew the Shephelah.
24Jr 17:27 °∞°ÆBut if you do not listen to me and refuse to keep the Sabbath holy, and if on the Sabbath day you bring loads of merchandise through the gates of Jerusalem just as on other days, then I will set fire to these gates. The fire will spread to the palaces, and no one will be able to put out the roaring flames.°Ø°±
24Jr 18:1 The Lord gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, 
24Jr 18:2 °∞Go down to the potter°Øs shop, and I will speak to you there.°± 
24Jr 18:3 So I did as he told me and found the potter working at his wheel. 
24Jr 18:4 But the jar he was making did not turn out as he had hoped, so he crushed it into a lump of clay again and started over.
24Jr 18:5 Then the Lord gave me this message£∫ 
24Jr 18:6 °∞O Israel, can I not do to you as this potter has done to his clay? As the clay is in the potter°Øs hand, so are you in my hand. 
24Jr 18:7 If I announce that a certain nation or kingdom is to be uprooted, torn down, and destroyed, 
24Jr 18:8 but then that nation renounces its evil ways, I will not destroy it as I had planned. 
24Jr 18:9 And if I announce that I will plant and build up a certain nation or kingdom, 
24Jr 18:10 but then that nation turns to evil and refuses to obey me, I will not bless it as I said I would.
24Jr 18:11 °∞Therefore, Jeremiah, go and warn all Judah and Jerusalem. Say to them, °ÆThis is what the Lord says£∫ I am planning disaster for you instead of good. So turn from your evil ways, each of you, and do what is right.°Ø°±
24Jr 18:12 But the people replied, °∞Don°Øt waste your breath. We will continue to live as we want to, stubbornly following our own evil desires.°±
24Jr 18:13 So this is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Has anyone ever heard of such a thing, even among the pagan nations? My virgin daughter Israel has done something terrible!
24Jr 18:14 Does the snow ever disappear from the mountaintops of Lebanon? Do the cold streams flowing from those distant mountains ever run dry?
24Jr 18:15 But my people are not so reliable, for they have deserted me; they burn incense to worthless idols. They have stumbled off the ancient highways and walk in muddy paths.
24Jr 18:16 Therefore, their land will become desolate, a monument to their stupidity. All who pass by will be astonished and will shake their heads in amazement.
24Jr 18:17 I will scatter my people before their enemies as the east wind scatters dust. And in all their trouble I will turn my back on them and refuse to notice their distress.°±
24Jr 18:18 Then the people said, °∞Come on, let°Øs plot a way to stop Jeremiah. We have plenty of priests and wise men and prophets. We don°Øt need him to teach the word and give us advice and prophecies. Let°Øs spread rumors about him and ignore what he says.°±
24Jr 18:19 Lord, hear me and help me! Listen to what my enemies are saying. 
24Jr 18:20 Should they repay evil for good? They have dug a pit to kill me, though I pleaded for them and tried to protect them from your anger.
24Jr 18:21 So let their children starve! Let them die by the sword! Let their wives become childless widows. Let their old men die in a plague, and let their young men be killed in battle!
24Jr 18:22 Let screaming be heard from their homes as warriors come suddenly upon them. For they have dug a pit for me and have hidden traps along my path.
24Jr 18:23 Lord, you know all about their murderous plots against me. Don°Øt forgive their crimes and blot out their sins. Let them die before you. Deal with them in your anger.
24Jr 19:1 This is what the Lord said to me£∫ °∞Go and buy a clay jar. Then ask some of the leaders of the people and of the priests to follow you. 
24Jr 19:2 Go out through the Gate of Broken Pots to the garbage dump in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, and give them this message. 
24Jr 19:3 Say to them, °ÆListen to this message from the Lord, you kings of Judah and citizens of Jerusalem! This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ I will bring a terrible disaster on this place, and the ears of those who hear about it will ring!
24Jr 19:4 °∞°ÆFor Israel has forsaken me and turned this valley into a place of wickedness. The people burn incense to foreign gods - idols never before acknowledged by this generation, by their ancestors, or by the kings of Judah. And they have filled this place with the blood of innocent children. 
24Jr 19:5 They have built pagan shrines to Baal, and there they burn their sons as sacrifices to Baal. I have never commanded such a horrible deed; it never even crossed my mind to command such a thing! 
24Jr 19:6 So beware, for the time is coming, says the Lord, when this garbage dump will no longer be called Topheth or the valley of Ben-Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter.
24Jr 19:7 °∞°ÆFor I will upset the careful plans of Judah and Jerusalem. I will allow the people to be slaughtered by invading armies, and I will leave their dead bodies as food for the vultures and wild animals. 
24Jr 19:8 I will reduce Jerusalem to ruins, making it a monument to their stupidity. All who pass by will be astonished and will gasp at the destruction they see there. 
24Jr 19:9 I will see to it that your enemies lay siege to the city until all the food is gone. Then those trapped inside will eat their own sons and daughters and friends. They will be driven to utter despair.°Ø
24Jr 19:10 °∞As these men watch you, Jeremiah, smash the jar you brought. 
24Jr 19:11 Then say to them, °ÆThis is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ As this jar lies shattered, so I will shatter the people of Judah and Jerusalem beyond all hope of repair. They will bury the bodies here in Topheth, the garbage dump, until there is no more room for them. 
24Jr 19:12 This is what I will do to this place and its people, says the Lord. I will cause this city to become defiled like Topheth. 
24Jr 19:13 Yes, all the houses in Jerusalem, including the palace of Judah°Øs kings, will become like Topheth - all the houses where you burned incense on the rooftops to your star gods, and where liquid offerings were poured out to your idols.°Ø°±
24Jr 19:14 Then Jeremiah returned from Topheth, the garbage dump where he had delivered this message, and he stopped in front of the Temple of the Lord. He said to the people there, 
24Jr 19:15 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °ÆI will bring disaster upon this city and its surrounding towns as I promised, because you have stubbornly refused to listen to me.°Ø°±
24Jr 20:1 Now Pashhur son of Immer, the priest in charge of the Temple of the Lord, heard what Jeremiah was prophesying. 
24Jr 20:2 So he arrested Jeremiah the prophet and had him whipped and put in stocks at the Benjamin Gate of the Lord°Øs Temple.
24Jr 20:3 The next day, when Pashhur finally released him, Jeremiah said, °∞Pashhur, the Lord has changed your name. From now on you are to be called °ÆThe Man Who Lives in Terror.°Ø®Á / ®ÁHebrew Magor-missabib, which means °∞surrounded by terror°±; also in 20.10.
24Jr 20:4 For this is what the Lord says£∫ °ÆI will send terror upon you and all your friends, and you will watch as they are slaughtered by the swords of the enemy. I will hand the people of Judah over to the king of Babylon. He will take them captive to Babylon or run them through with the sword. 
24Jr 20:5 And I will let your enemies plunder Jerusalem. All the famed treasures of the city - the precious jewels and gold and silver of your kings - will be carried off to Babylon. 
24Jr 20:6 As for you, Pashhur, you and all your household will go as captives to Babylon. There you will die and be buried, you and all your friends to whom you prophesied that everything would be all right.°Ø°±
24Jr 20:7 O Lord, you misled me, and I allowed myself to be misled. You are stronger than I am, and you overpowered me. Now I am mocked every day; everyone laughs at me.
24Jr 20:8 When I speak, the words burst out. °∞Violence and destruction!°± I shout. So these messages from the Lord have made me a household joke.
24Jr 20:9 But if I say I°Øll never mention the Lord or speak in his name, his word burns in my heart like a fire. It°Øs like a fire in my bones! I am worn out trying to hold it in! I can°Øt do it!
24Jr 20:10 I have heard the many rumors about me. They call me °∞The Man Who Lives in Terror.°± They threaten, °∞If you say anything, we will report it.°± Even my old friends are watching me, waiting for a fatal slip. °∞He will trap himself,°± they say, °∞and then we will get our revenge on him.°±
24Jr 20:11 But the Lord stands beside me like a great warrior. Before him my persecutors will stumble. They cannot defeat me. They will fail and be thoroughly humiliated. Their dishonor will never be forgotten.
24Jr 20:12 O Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, you test those who are righteous, and you examine the deepest thoughts and secrets. Let me see your vengeance against them, for I have committed my cause to you.
24Jr 20:13 Sing to the Lord! Praise the Lord! For though I was poor and needy, he rescued me from my oppressors.
24Jr 20:14 Yet I curse the day I was born! May no one celebrate the day of my birth.
24Jr 20:15 I curse the messenger who told my father, °∞Good news - you have a son!°±
24Jr 20:16 Let him be destroyed like the cities of old that the Lord overthrew without mercy. Terrify him all day long with battle shouts,
24Jr 20:17 because he did not kill me at birth. Oh, that I had died in my mother°Øs womb, that her body had been my grave!
24Jr 20:18 Why was I ever born? My entire life has been filled with trouble, sorrow, and shame.
24Jr 21:1 The Lord spoke through Jeremiah when King Zedekiah sent Pashhur son of Malkijah and Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest, to speak with him. They begged Jeremiah, 
24Jr 21:2 °∞Please speak to the Lord for us and ask him to help us. King Nebuchadnezzar®Á of Babylon is attacking Judah. Perhaps the Lord will be gracious and do a mighty miracle as he has done in the past. Perhaps he will force Nebuchadnezzar to withdraw his armies.°± / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar; also in 21.7.
24Jr 21:3 Jeremiah replied, °∞Go back to King Zedekiah and tell him, 
24Jr 21:4 °ÆThis is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says£∫ I will make your weapons useless against the king of Babylon and the Babylonians®Á who are outside your walls attacking you. In fact, I will bring your enemies right into the heart of this city. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans; also in 21.9.
24Jr 21:5 I myself will fight against you with a strong hand and a powerful arm, for I am very angry. You have made me furious! 
24Jr 21:6 I will send a terrible plague upon this city, and both people and animals will die. 
24Jr 21:7 And after all that, says the Lord, I will hand over King Zedekiah, his staff, and everyone else in the city who survives the disease, war, and famine. I will hand them over to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and to their other enemies. He will slaughter them and show them no mercy, pity, or compassion.°Ø
24Jr 21:8 °∞Tell all the people, °ÆThis is what the Lord says£∫ Take your choice of life or death! 
24Jr 21:9 Everyone who stays in Jerusalem will die from war, famine, or disease, but those who go out and surrender to the Babylonians will live. Their reward will be life! 
24Jr 21:10 For I have decided to bring disaster and not good upon this city, says the Lord. It will be handed over to the king of Babylon, and he will reduce it to ashes.°Ø
24Jr 21:11 °∞Say to the royal family of Judah, °ÆListen to this message from the Lord! 
24Jr 21:12 This is what the Lord says to the dynasty of David£∫ °∞°ÆGive justice each morning to the people you judge! Help those who have been robbed; rescue them from their oppressors. Otherwise, my anger will burn like an unquenchable fire because of all your sins.
24Jr 21:13 I will personally fight against the people in Jerusalem, that mighty fortress - the people who boast, °∞No one can touch us here. No one can break in here.°±
24Jr 21:14 And I myself will punish you for your sinfulness, says the Lord. I will light a fire in your forests that will burn up everything around you.°Ø°±
24Jr 22:1 This is what the Lord said to me£∫ °∞Go over and speak directly to the king of Judah. Say to him, 
24Jr 22:2 °ÆListen to this message from the Lord, you king of Judah, sitting on David°Øs throne. Let your attendants and your people listen, too. 
24Jr 22:3 This is what the Lord says£∫ Be fair-minded and just. Do what is right! Help those who have been robbed; rescue them from their oppressors. Quit your evil deeds! Do not mistreat foreigners, orphans, and widows. Stop murdering the innocent! 
24Jr 22:4 If you obey me, there will always be a descendant of David sitting on the throne here in Jerusalem. The king will ride through the palace gates in chariots and on horses, with his parade of attendants and subjects. 
24Jr 22:5 But if you refuse to pay attention to this warning, I swear by my own name, says the Lord, that this palace will become a pile of rubble.°Ø°±
24Jr 22:6 Now this is what the Lord says concerning Judah°Øs royal palace£∫ °∞I love you as much as fruitful Gilead and the green forests of Lebanon. But I will turn you into a desert, with no one living within your walls.
24Jr 22:7 I will call for wreckers, who will bring out their tools to dismantle you. They will tear out all your fine cedar beams and throw them on the fire.
24Jr 22:8 °∞People from many nations will pass by the ruins of this city and say to one another, °ÆWhy did the Lord destroy such a great city?°Ø 
24Jr 22:9 And the answer will be, °ÆBecause they violated their covenant with the Lord their God by worshiping other gods.°Ø°±
24Jr 22:10 Do not weep for the dead king or mourn his loss. Instead, weep for the captive king being led away! For he will never return to see his native land again.
24Jr 22:11 For this is what the Lord says about Jehoahaz®Á, who succeeded his father, King Josiah, and was taken away as a captive£∫ °∞He will never return. / ®ÁHebrew Shallum, another name for Jehoahaz.
24Jr 22:12 He will die in a distant land and will never again see his own country.°±
24Jr 22:13 And the Lord says, °∞What sorrow awaits Jehoiakim®Á, who builds his palace with forced labor®Ë. He builds injustice into its walls, for he makes his neighbors work for nothing. He does not pay them for their labor. / ®ÁThe brother and successor of the exiled Jehoahaz. See 22.18. ®ËHebrew by unrighteousness.
24Jr 22:14 He says, °ÆI will build a magnificent palace with huge rooms and many windows. I will panel it throughout with fragrant cedar and paint it a lovely red.°Ø
24Jr 22:15 But a beautiful cedar palace does not make a great king! Your father, Josiah, also had plenty to eat and drink. But he was just and right in all his dealings. That is why God blessed him.
24Jr 22:16 He gave justice and help to the poor and needy, and everything went well for him. Isn°Øt that what it means to know me?°± says the Lord.
24Jr 22:17 °∞But you! You have eyes only for greed and dishonesty! You murder the innocent, oppress the poor, and reign ruthlessly.°±
24Jr 22:18 Therefore, this is what the Lord says about Jehoiakim, son of King Josiah£∫ °∞The people will not mourn for him, crying to one another, °ÆAlas, my brother! Alas, my sister!°Ø His subjects will not mourn for him, crying, °ÆAlas, our master is dead! Alas, his splendor is gone!°Ø
24Jr 22:19 He will be buried like a dead donkey - dragged out of Jerusalem and dumped outside the gates!
24Jr 22:20 Weep for your allies in Lebanon. Shout for them in Bashan. Search for them in the regions east of the river®Á. See, they are all destroyed. Not one is left to help you. / ®ÁOr in Abarim.
24Jr 22:21 I warned you when you were prosperous, but you replied, °ÆDon°Øt bother me.°Ø You have been that way since childhood - you simply will not obey me!
24Jr 22:22 And now the wind will blow away your allies. All your friends will be taken away as captives. Surely then you will see your wickedness and be ashamed.
24Jr 22:23 It may be nice to live in a beautiful palace paneled with wood from the cedars of Lebanon, but soon you will groan with pangs of anguish - anguish like that of a woman in labor.
24Jr 22:24 °∞As surely as I live,°± says the Lord, °∞I will abandon you, Jehoiachin®Á son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah. Even if you were the signet ring on my right hand, I would pull you off. / ®ÁHebrew Coniah, a variant spelling of Jehoiachin; also 22.28.
24Jr 22:25 I will hand you over to those who seek to kill you, those you so desperately fear - to King Nebuchadnezzar®Ë of Babylon and the mighty Babylonian®Á army. / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar. ®ËOr Chaldean.
24Jr 22:26 I will expel you and your mother from this land, and you will die in a foreign country, not in your native land. 
24Jr 22:27 You will never again return to the land you yearn for.
24Jr 22:28 °∞Why is this man Jehoiachin like a discarded, broken jar? Why are he and his children to be exiled to a foreign land?
24Jr 22:29 O earth, earth, earth! Listen to this message from the Lord!
24Jr 22:30 This is what the Lord says£∫ °ÆLet the record show that this man Jehoiachin was childless. He is a failure, for none of his children will succeed him on the throne of David to rule over Judah.°Ø
24Jr 23:1 °∞What sorrow awaits the leaders of my people - the shepherds of my sheep - for they have destroyed and scattered the very ones they were expected to care for,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 23:2 Therefore, this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to these shepherds£∫ °∞Instead of caring for my flock and leading them to safety, you have deserted them and driven them to destruction. Now I will pour out judgment on you for the evil you have done to them. 
24Jr 23:3 But I will gather together the remnant of my flock from the countries where I have driven them. I will bring them back to their own sheepfold, and they will be fruitful and increase in number. 
24Jr 23:4 Then I will appoint responsible shepherds who will care for them, and they will never be afraid again. Not a single one will be lost or missing. I, the Lord have spoken!
24Jr 23:5 °∞For the time is coming,°± says the Lord, °∞when I will raise up a righteous descendant®Á from King David°Øs line. He will be a King who rules with wisdom. He will do what is just and right throughout the land. / ®ÁHebrew a righteous branch.
24Jr 23:6 And this will be his name£∫ °ÆThe Lord Is Our Righteousness.°Ø®Á In that day Judah will be saved, and Israel will live in safety. / ®ÁHebrew Yahweh Tsidqenu.
24Jr 23:7 °∞In that day,°± says the Lord, °∞when people are taking an oath, they will no longer say, °ÆAs surely as the Lord lives, who rescued the people of Israel from the land of Egypt.°Ø 
24Jr 23:8 Instead, they will say, °ÆAs surely as the Lord lives, who brought the people of Israel back to their own land from the land of the north and from all the countries to which he had exiled them.°Ø Then they will live in their own land.°±
24Jr 23:9 My heart is broken because of the false prophets, and my bones tremble. I stagger like a drunkard, like someone overcome by wine, because of the holy words the Lord has spoken against them.
24Jr 23:10 For the land is full of adultery, and it lies under a curse. The land itself is in mourning - its wilderness pastures are dried up. For they all do evil and abuse what power they have.
24Jr 23:11 °∞Even the priests and prophets are ungodly, wicked men. I have seen their despicable acts right here in my own Temple,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 23:12 °∞Therefore, the paths they take will become slippery. They will be chased through the dark, and there they will fall. For I will bring disaster upon them at the time fixed for their punishment. I, the Lord, have spoken!
24Jr 23:13 °∞I saw that the prophets of Samaria were terribly evil, for they prophesied in the name of Baal and led my people of Israel into sin.
24Jr 23:14 But now I see that the prophets of Jerusalem are even worse! They commit adultery and love dishonesty. They encourage those who are doing evil so that no one turns away from their sins. These prophets are as wicked as the people of Sodom and Gomorrah once were.°±
24Jr 23:15 Therefore, this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says concerning the prophets£∫ °∞I will feed them with bitterness and give them poison to drink. For it is because of Jerusalem°Øs prophets that wickedness has filled this land.°±
24Jr 23:16 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says to his people£∫ °∞Do not listen to these prophets when they prophesy to you, filling you with futile hopes. They are making up everything they say. They do not speak for the Lord!
24Jr 23:17 They keep saying to those who despise my word, °ÆDon°Øt worry! The Lord says you will have peace!°Ø And to those who stubbornly follow their own desires, they say, °ÆNo harm will come your way!°Ø
24Jr 23:18 °∞Have any of these prophets been in the Lord°Øs presence to hear what he is really saying? Has even one of them cared enough to listen?
24Jr 23:19 Look! The Lord°Øs anger bursts out like a storm, a whirlwind that swirls down on the heads of the wicked.
24Jr 23:20 The anger of the Lord will not diminish until it has finished all he has planned. In the days to come you will understand all this very clearly.
24Jr 23:21 °∞I have not sent these prophets, yet they run around claiming to speak for me. I have given them no message, yet they go on prophesying.
24Jr 23:22 If they had stood before me and listened to me, they would have spoken my words, and they would have turned my people from their evil ways and deeds.
24Jr 23:23 Am I a God who is only close at hand?°± says the Lord. °∞No, I am far away at the same time.
24Jr 23:24 Can anyone hide from me in a secret place? Am I not everywhere in all the heavens and earth?°± says the Lord.
24Jr 23:25 °∞I have heard these prophets say, °ÆListen to the dream I had from God last night.°Ø And then they proceed to tell lies in my name. 
24Jr 23:26 How long will this go on? If they are prophets, they are prophets of deceit, inventing everything they say. 
24Jr 23:27 By telling these false dreams, they are trying to get my people to forget me, just as their ancestors did by worshiping the idols of Baal.
24Jr 23:28 °∞Let these false prophets tell their dreams, but let my true messengers faithfully proclaim my every word. There is a difference between straw and grain!
24Jr 23:29 Does not my word burn like fire?°± says the Lord. °∞Is it not like a mighty hammer that smashes a rock to pieces?
24Jr 23:30 °∞Therefore,°± says the Lord, °∞I am against these prophets who steal messages from each other and claim they are from me. 
24Jr 23:31 I am against these smooth-tongued prophets who say, °ÆThis prophecy is from the Lord!°Ø 
24Jr 23:32 I am against these false prophets. Their imaginary dreams are flagrant lies that lead my people into sin. I did not send or appoint them, and they have no message at all for my people. I, the Lord have spoken!
24Jr 23:33 °∞Suppose one of the people or one of the prophets or priests asks you, °ÆWhat prophecy has the Lord burdened you with now?°Ø You must reply, °ÆYou are the burden!®Á The Lord says he will abandon you!°Ø / ®ÁAs in Greek version and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew reads What burden?
24Jr 23:34 °∞If any prophet, priest, or anyone else says, °ÆI have a prophecy from the Lord,°Ø I will punish that person along with his entire family. 
24Jr 23:35 You should keep asking each other, °ÆWhat is the Lord°Øs answer?°Ø or °ÆWhat is the Lord saying?°Ø 
24Jr 23:36 But stop using this phrase, °Æprophecy from the Lord.°Ø For people are using it to give authority to their own ideas, turning upside down the words of our God, the living God, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.
24Jr 23:37 °∞This is what you should say to the prophets£∫ °ÆWhat is the Lord°Øs answer?°Ø or °ÆWhat is the Lord saying?°Ø 
24Jr 23:38 But suppose they respond, °ÆThis is a prophecy from the Lord!°Ø Then you should say, °ÆThis is what the Lord says£∫ Because you have used this phrase, °∞prophecy from the Lord,°± even though I warned you not to use it, 
24Jr 23:39 I will forget you completely. I will expel you from my presence, along with this city that I gave to you and your ancestors. 
24Jr 23:40 And I will make you an object of ridicule, and your name will be infamous throughout the ages.°Ø°±
24Jr 24:1 After King Nebuchadnezzar®Á of Babylon exiled Jehoiachin®Ë son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, to Babylon along with the officials of Judah and all the craftsmen and artisans, the Lord gave me this vision. I saw two baskets of figs placed in front of the Lord°Øs Temple in Jerusalem. / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar. ®ËHebrew Jeconiah, a variant spelling of Jehoiachin.
24Jr 24:2 One basket was filled with fresh, ripe figs, while the other was filled with bad figs that were too rotten to eat.
24Jr 24:3 Then the Lord said to me, °∞What do you see, Jeremiah?°± I replied, °∞Figs, some very good and some very bad, too rotten to eat.°±
24Jr 24:4 Then the Lord gave me this message£∫ 
24Jr 24:5 °∞This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says£∫ The good figs represent the exiles I sent from Judah to the land of the Babylonians®Á. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans.
24Jr 24:6 I will watch over and care for them, and I will bring them back here again. I will build them up and not tear them down. I will plant them and not uproot them. 
24Jr 24:7 I will give them hearts that recognize me as the Lord. They will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me wholeheartedly.
24Jr 24:8 °∞But the bad figs,°± the Lord said, °∞represent King Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, all the people left in Jerusalem, and those who live in Egypt. I will treat them like bad figs, too rotten to eat. 
24Jr 24:9 I will make them an object of horror and a symbol of evil to every nation on earth. They will be disgraced and mocked, taunted and cursed, wherever I scatter them. 
24Jr 24:10 And I will send war, famine, and disease until they have vanished from the land of Israel, which I gave to them and their ancestors.°±
24Jr 25:1 This message for all the people of Judah came to Jeremiah from the Lord during the fourth year of Jehoiakim°Øs reign over Judah®Á. This was the year when King Nebuchadnezzar®Ë of Babylon began his reign. / ®ÁThe fourth year of Jehoiakim°Øs reign and the accession year of Nebuchadnezzar°Øs reign was 605 b.c. ®ËHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar; also in 25.9.
24Jr 25:2 Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people in Judah and Jerusalem, 
24Jr 25:3 °∞For the past twenty-three years - from the thirteenth year of the reign of Josiah son of Amon®Á, king of Judah, until now - the Lord has been giving me his messages. I have faithfully passed them on to you, but you have not listened. / ®ÁThe thirteenth year of Josiah°Øs reign was 627 b.c.
24Jr 25:4 °∞Again and again the Lord has sent you his servants, the prophets, but you have not listened or even paid attention. 
24Jr 25:5 Each time the message was this£∫ °ÆTurn from the evil road you are traveling and from the evil things you are doing. Only then will I let you live in this land that the Lord gave to you and your ancestors forever. 
24Jr 25:6 Do not provoke my anger by worshiping idols you made with your own hands. Then I will not harm you.°Ø
24Jr 25:7 °∞But you would not listen to me,°± says the Lord. °∞You made me furious by worshiping idols you made with your own hands, bringing on yourselves all the disasters you now suffer. 
24Jr 25:8 And now the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ Because you have not listened to me, 
24Jr 25:9 I will gather together all the armies of the north under King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whom I have appointed as my deputy. I will bring them all against this land and its people and against the surrounding nations. I will completely destroy®Á you and make you an object of horror and contempt and a ruin forever. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the Lord, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.
24Jr 25:10 I will take away your happy singing and laughter. The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will no longer be heard. Your millstones will fall silent, and the lights in your homes will go out. 
24Jr 25:11 This entire land will become a desolate wasteland. Israel and her neighboring lands will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.
24Jr 25:12 °∞Then, after the seventy years of captivity are over, I will punish the king of Babylon and his people for their sins,°± says the Lord. °∞I will make the country of the Babylonians®Á a wasteland forever. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans.
24Jr 25:13 I will bring upon them all the terrors I have promised in this book - all the penalties announced by Jeremiah against the nations. 
24Jr 25:14 Many nations and great kings will enslave the Babylonians, just as they enslaved my people. I will punish them in proportion to the suffering they cause my people.°±
24Jr 25:15 This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, said to me£∫ °∞Take from my hand this cup filled to the brim with my anger, and make all the nations to whom I send you drink from it. 
24Jr 25:16 When they drink from it, they will stagger, crazed by the warfare I will send against them.°±
24Jr 25:17 So I took the cup of anger from the Lord and made all the nations drink from it - every nation to which the Lord sent me. 
24Jr 25:18 I went to Jerusalem and the other towns of Judah, and their kings and officials drank from the cup. From that day until this, they have been a desolate ruin, an object of horror, contempt, and cursing. 
24Jr 25:19 I gave the cup to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, his attendants, his officials, and all his people, 
24Jr 25:20 along with all the foreigners living in that land. I also gave it to all the kings of the land of Uz and the kings of the Philistine cities of Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and what remains of Ashdod.
24Jr 25:21 Then I gave the cup to the nations of Edom, Moab, and Ammon, 
24Jr 25:22 and the kings of Tyre and Sidon, and the kings of the regions across the sea. 
24Jr 25:23 I gave it to Dedan, Tema, and Buz, and to the people who live in distant places®Á. / ®ÁOr who clip the corners of their hair.
24Jr 25:24 I gave it to the kings of Arabia, the kings of the nomadic tribes of the desert, 
24Jr 25:25 and to the kings of Zimri, Elam, and Media. 
24Jr 25:26 And I gave it to the kings of the northern countries, far and near, one after the other - all the kingdoms of the world. And finally, the king of Babylon®Á himself drank from the cup of the Lord°Øs anger. / ®ÁHebrew of Sheshach, a code name for Babylon.
24Jr 25:27 Then the Lord said to me, °∞Now tell them, °ÆThis is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ Drink from this cup of my anger. Get drunk and vomit; fall to rise no more, for I am sending terrible wars against you.°Ø 
24Jr 25:28 And if they refuse to accept the cup, tell them, °ÆThe Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ You have no choice but to drink from it. 
24Jr 25:29 I have begun to punish Jerusalem, the city that bears my name. Now should I let you go unpunished? No, you will not escape disaster. I will call for war against all the nations of the earth. I, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, have spoken!°Ø
24Jr 25:30 °∞Now prophesy all these things, and say to them, °∞°ÆThe Lord will roar against his own land from his holy dwelling in heaven. He will shout like those who tread grapes; he will shout against everyone on earth.
24Jr 25:31 His cry of judgment will reach the ends of the earth, for the Lord will bring his case against all the nations. He will judge all the people of the earth, slaughtering the wicked with the sword. I, the Lord, have spoken!°Ø°±
24Jr 25:32 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ °∞Look! Disaster will fall upon nation after nation! A great whirlwind of fury is rising from the most distant corners of the earth!°±
24Jr 25:33 In that day those the Lord has slaughtered will fill the earth from one end to the other. No one will mourn for them or gather up their bodies to bury them. They will be scattered on the ground like manure.
24Jr 25:34 Weep and moan, you evil shepherds! Roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock! The time of your slaughter has arrived; you will fall and shatter like a fragile vase.
24Jr 25:35 You will find no place to hide; there will be no way to escape.
24Jr 25:36 Listen to the frantic cries of the shepherds. The leaders of the flock are wailing in despair, for the Lord is ruining their pastures.
24Jr 25:37 Peaceful meadows will be turned into a wasteland by the Lord°Øs fierce anger.
24Jr 25:38 He has left his den like a strong lion seeking its prey, and their land will be made desolate by the sword of the enemy and the Lord°Øs fierce anger.
24Jr 26:1 This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord early in the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah®Á, king of Judah. / ®ÁThe first year of Jehoiakim°Øs reign was 608 b.c.
24Jr 26:2 °∞This is what the Lord says£∫ Stand in the courtyard in front of the Temple of the Lord, and make an announcement to the people who have come there to worship from all over Judah. Give them my entire message; include every word. 
24Jr 26:3 Perhaps they will listen and turn from their evil ways. Then I will change my mind about the disaster I am ready to pour out on them because of their sins.
24Jr 26:4 °∞Say to them, °ÆThis is what the Lord says£∫ If you will not listen to me and obey my word I have given you, 
24Jr 26:5 and if you will not listen to my servants, the prophets - for I sent them again and again to warn you, but you would not listen to them - 
24Jr 26:6 then I will destroy this Temple as I destroyed Shiloh, the place where the Tabernacle was located. And I will make Jerusalem an object of cursing in every nation on earth.°Ø°±
24Jr 26:7 The priests, the prophets, and all the people listened to Jeremiah as he spoke in front of the Lord°Øs Temple. 
24Jr 26:8 But when Jeremiah had finished his message, saying everything the Lord had told him to say, the priests and prophets and all the people at the Temple mobbed him. °∞Kill him!°± they shouted. 
24Jr 26:9 °∞What right do you have to prophesy in the Lord°Øs name that this Temple will be destroyed like Shiloh? What do you mean, saying that Jerusalem will be destroyed and left with no inhabitants?°± And all the people threatened him as he stood in front of the Temple.
24Jr 26:10 When the officials of Judah heard what was happening, they rushed over from the palace and sat down at the New Gate of the Temple to hold court. 
24Jr 26:11 The priests and prophets presented their accusations to the officials and the people. °∞This man should die!°± they said. °∞You have heard with your own ears what a traitor he is, for he has prophesied against this city.°±
24Jr 26:12 Then Jeremiah spoke to the officials and the people in his own defense. °∞The Lord sent me to prophesy against this Temple and this city,°± he said. °∞The Lord gave me every word that I have spoken. 
24Jr 26:13 But if you stop your sinning and begin to obey the Lord your God, he will change his mind about this disaster that he has announced against you. 
24Jr 26:14 As for me, I am in your hands - do with me as you think best. 
24Jr 26:15 But if you kill me, rest assured that you will be killing an innocent man! The responsibility for such a deed will lie on you, on this city, and on every person living in it. For it is absolutely true that the Lord sent me to speak every word you have heard.°±
24Jr 26:16 Then the officials and the people said to the priests and prophets, °∞This man does not deserve the death sentence, for he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God.°±
24Jr 26:17 Then some of the wise old men stood and spoke to all the people assembled there. 
24Jr 26:18 They said, °∞Remember when Micah of Moresheth prophesied during the reign of King Hezekiah of Judah. He told the people of Judah, °ÆThis is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ Mount Zion will be plowed like an open field; Jerusalem will be reduced to ruins! A thicket will grow on the heights where the Temple now stands.°Ø®Á / ®ÁMic 3.12.
24Jr 26:19 But did King Hezekiah and the people kill him for saying this? No, they turned from their sins and worshiped the Lord. They begged him for mercy. Then the Lord changed his mind about the terrible disaster he had pronounced against them. So we are about to do ourselves great harm.°±
24Jr 26:20 At this time Uriah son of Shemaiah from Kiriath-jearim was also prophesying for the Lord. And he predicted the same terrible disaster against the city and nation as Jeremiah did. 
24Jr 26:21 When King Jehoiakim and the army officers and officials heard what he was saying, the king sent someone to kill him. But Uriah heard about the plan and escaped in fear to Egypt. 
24Jr 26:22 Then King Jehoiakim sent Elnathan son of Acbor to Egypt along with several other men to capture Uriah. 
24Jr 26:23 They took him prisoner and brought him back to King Jehoiakim. The king then killed Uriah with a sword and had him buried in an unmarked grave.
24Jr 26:24 Nevertheless, Ahikam son of Shaphan stood up for Jeremiah and persuaded the court not to turn him over to the mob to be killed.
24Jr 27:1 This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord early in the reign of Zedekiah®Á son of Josiah, king of Judah. / ®ÁAs in some Hebrew manuscripts and Syriac version (see also 27.3, 12); most Hebrew manuscripts read Jehoiakim.
24Jr 27:2 This is what the Lord said to me£∫ °∞Make a yoke, and fasten it on your neck with leather thongs. 
24Jr 27:3 Then send messages to the kings of Edom, Moab, Ammon, Tyre, and Sidon through their ambassadors who have come to see King Zedekiah in Jerusalem. 
24Jr 27:4 Give them this message for their masters£∫ °ÆThis is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ 
24Jr 27:5 With my great strength and powerful arm I made the earth and all its people and every animal. I can give these things of mine to anyone I choose. 
24Jr 27:6 Now I will give your countries to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who is my servant. I have put everything, even the wild animals, under his control. 
24Jr 27:7 All the nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until his time is up. Then many nations and great kings will conquer and rule over Babylon. 
24Jr 27:8 So you must submit to Babylon°Øs king and serve him; put your neck under Babylon°Øs yoke! I will punish any nation that refuses to be his slave, says the Lord. I will send war, famine, and disease upon that nation until Babylon has conquered it.
24Jr 27:9 °∞°ÆDo not listen to your false prophets, fortune-tellers, interpreters of dreams, mediums, and sorcerers who say, °∞The king of Babylon will not conquer you.°± 
24Jr 27:10 They are all liars, and their lies will lead to your being driven out of your land. I will drive you out and send you far away to die. 
24Jr 27:11 But the people of any nation that submits to the king of Babylon will be allowed to stay in their own country to farm the land as usual. I, the Lord, have spoken!°Ø°±
24Jr 27:12 Then I repeated this same message to King Zedekiah of Judah. °∞If you want to live, submit to the yoke of the king of Babylon and his people. 
24Jr 27:13 Why do you insist on dying - you and your people? Why should you choose war, famine, and disease, which the Lord will bring against every nation that refuses to submit to Babylon°Øs king? 
24Jr 27:14 Do not listen to the false prophets who keep telling you, °ÆThe king of Babylon will not conquer you.°Ø They are liars. 
24Jr 27:15 This is what the Lord says£∫ °ÆI have not sent these prophets! They are telling you lies in my name, so I will drive you from this land. You will all die - you and all these prophets, too.°Ø°±
24Jr 27:16 Then I spoke to the priests and the people and said, °∞This is what the Lord says£∫ °ÆDo not listen to your prophets who claim that soon the gold articles taken from my Temple will be returned from Babylon. It is all a lie! 
24Jr 27:17 Do not listen to them. Surrender to the king of Babylon, and you will live. Why should this whole city be destroyed? 
24Jr 27:18 If they really are prophets and speak the Lord°Øs messages, let them pray to the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. Let them pray that the articles remaining in the Lord°Øs Temple and in the king°Øs palace and in the palaces of Jerusalem will not be carried away to Babylon!°Ø
24Jr 27:19 °∞For the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has spoken about the pillars in front of the Temple, the great bronze basin called the Sea, the water carts, and all the other ceremonial articles. 
24Jr 27:20 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon left them here when he exiled Jehoiachin®Á son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, to Babylon, along with all the other nobles of Judah and Jerusalem. / ®ÁHebrew Jeconiah, a variant spelling of Jehoiachin.
24Jr 27:21 Yes, this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says about the precious things still in the Temple and in the palace of Judah°Øs king£∫ 
24Jr 27:22 °ÆThey will all be carried away to Babylon and will stay there until I send for them,°Ø says the Lord. °ÆThen I will bring them back to Jerusalem again.°Ø°±
24Jr 28:1 One day in late summer®Á of that same year - the fourth year of the reign of Zedekiah, king of Judah - Hananiah son of Azzur, a prophet from Gibeon, addressed me publicly in the Temple while all the priests and people listened. He said, / ®ÁHebrew In the fifth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. The fifth month in the fourth year of Zedekiah°Øs reign occurred within the months of August and September 593 b.c. Also see note on 1.3.
24Jr 28:2 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °ÆI will remove the yoke of the king of Babylon from your necks. 
24Jr 28:3 Within two years I will bring back all the Temple treasures that King Nebuchadnezzar carried off to Babylon. 
24Jr 28:4 And I will bring back Jehoiachin®Á son of Jehoiakim, king of Judah, and all the other captives that were taken to Babylon. I will surely break the yoke that the king of Babylon has put on your necks. I, the Lord, have spoken!°Ø°± / ®ÁHebrew Jeconiah, a variant spelling of Jehoiachin.
24Jr 28:5 Jeremiah responded to Hananiah as they stood in front of all the priests and people at the Temple. 
24Jr 28:6 He said, °∞Amen! May your prophecies come true! I hope the Lord does everything you say. I hope he does bring back from Babylon the treasures of this Temple and all the captives. 
24Jr 28:7 But listen now to the solemn words I speak to you in the presence of all these people. 
24Jr 28:8 The ancient prophets who preceded you and me spoke against many nations, always warning of war, disaster, and disease. 
24Jr 28:9 So a prophet who predicts peace must show he is right. Only when his predictions come true can we know that he is really from the Lord.°±
24Jr 28:10 Then Hananiah the prophet took the yoke off Jeremiah°Øs neck and broke it in pieces. 
24Jr 28:11 And Hananiah said again to the crowd that had gathered, °∞This is what the Lord says£∫ °ÆJust as this yoke has been broken, within two years I will break the yoke of oppression from all the nations now subject to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.°Ø°± With that, Jeremiah left the Temple area.
24Jr 28:12 Soon after this confrontation with Hananiah, the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah£∫ 
24Jr 28:13 °∞Go and tell Hananiah, °ÆThis is what the Lord says£∫ You have broken a wooden yoke, but you have replaced it with a yoke of iron. 
24Jr 28:14 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ I have put a yoke of iron on the necks of all these nations, forcing them into slavery under King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. I have put everything, even the wild animals, under his control.°Ø°±
24Jr 28:15 Then Jeremiah the prophet said to Hananiah, °∞Listen, Hananiah! The Lord has not sent you, but the people believe your lies. 
24Jr 28:16 Therefore, this is what the Lord says£∫ °ÆYou must die. Your life will end this very year because you have rebelled against the Lord.°Ø°±
24Jr 28:17 Two months later®Á the prophet Hananiah died. / ®ÁHebrew In the seventh month of that same year. See 28.1 and the note there.
24Jr 29:1 Jeremiah wrote a letter from Jerusalem to the elders, priests, prophets, and all the people who had been exiled to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. 
24Jr 29:2 This was after King Jehoiachin®Á, the queen mother, the court officials, the other officials of Judah, and all the craftsmen and artisans had been deported from Jerusalem. / ®ÁHebrew Jeconiah, a variant spelling of Jehoiachin.
24Jr 29:3 He sent the letter with Elasah son of Shaphan and Gemariah son of Hilkiah when they went to Babylon as King Zedekiah°Øs ambassadors to Nebuchadnezzar. This is what Jeremiah°Øs letter said.
24Jr 29:4 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the captives he has exiled to Babylon from Jerusalem£∫ 
24Jr 29:5 °∞Build homes, and plan to stay. Plant gardens, and eat the food they produce. 
24Jr 29:6 Marry and have children. Then find spouses for them so that you may have many grandchildren. Multiply! Do not dwindle away! 
24Jr 29:7 And work for the peace and prosperity of the city where I sent you into exile. Pray to the Lord for it, for its welfare will determine your welfare.°±
24Jr 29:8 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °∞Do not let your prophets and fortune-tellers who are with you in the land of Babylon trick you. Do not listen to their dreams, 
24Jr 29:9 because they are telling you lies in my name. I have not sent them,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 29:10 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞You will be in Babylon for seventy years. But then I will come and do for you all the good things I have promised, and I will bring you home again. 
24Jr 29:11 For I know the plans I have for you,°± says the Lord. °∞They are plans for good and not for disaster, to give you a future and a hope. 
24Jr 29:12 In those days when you pray, I will listen. 
24Jr 29:13 If you look for me wholeheartedly, you will find me. 
24Jr 29:14 I will be found by you,°± says the Lord. °∞I will end your captivity and restore your fortunes. I will gather you out of the nations where I sent you and will bring you home again to your own land.°±
24Jr 29:15 You claim that the Lord has raised up prophets for you in Babylon. 
24Jr 29:16 But this is what the Lord says about the king who sits on David°Øs throne and all those still living here in Jerusalem - your relatives who were not exiled to Babylon. 
24Jr 29:17 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ °∞I will send war, famine, and disease upon them and make them like bad figs, too rotten to eat. 
24Jr 29:18 Yes, I will pursue them with war, famine, and disease, and I will scatter them around the world. In every nation where I send them, I will make them an object of damnation, horror, contempt, and mockery. 
24Jr 29:19 For they refuse to listen to me, though I have spoken to them repeatedly through the prophets I sent. And you who are in exile have not listened either,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 29:20 Therefore, listen to this message from the Lord, all you captives there in Babylon. 
24Jr 29:21 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says about your prophets - Ahab son of Kolaiah and Zedekiah son of Maaseiah - who are telling you lies in my name£∫ °∞I will turn them over to Nebuchadnezzar®Á for execution before your eyes. / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar.
24Jr 29:22 Their terrible fate will become proverbial, so that the Judean exiles will curse someone by saying, °ÆMay the Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the king of Babylon burned alive!°Ø 
24Jr 29:23 For these men have done terrible things among my people. They have committed adultery with their neighbors°Ø wives and have lied in my name, saying things I did not command. I am a witness to this. I, the Lord, have spoken.°±
24Jr 29:24 The Lord sent this message to Shemaiah the Nehelamite in Babylon£∫ 
24Jr 29:25 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ You wrote a letter on your own authority to Zephaniah son of Maaseiah, the priest, and you sent copies to the other priests and people in Jerusalem. You wrote to Zephaniah,
24Jr 29:26 °∞The Lord has appointed you to replace Jehoiada as the priest in charge of the house of the Lord. You are responsible to put into stocks and neck irons any crazy man who claims to be a prophet. 
24Jr 29:27 So why have you done nothing to stop Jeremiah from Anathoth, who pretends to be a prophet among you? 
24Jr 29:28 Jeremiah sent a letter here to Babylon, predicting that our captivity will be a long one. He said, °ÆBuild homes, and plan to stay. Plant gardens, and eat the food they produce.°Ø°±
24Jr 29:29 But when Zephaniah the priest received Shemaiah°Øs letter, he took it to Jeremiah and read it to him. 
24Jr 29:30 Then the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah£∫ 
24Jr 29:31 °∞Send an open letter to all the exiles in Babylon. Tell them, °ÆThis is what the Lord says concerning Shemaiah the Nehelamite£∫ Since he has prophesied to you when I did not send him and has tricked you into believing his lies, 
24Jr 29:32 I will punish him and his family. None of his descendants will see the good things I will do for my people, for he has incited you to rebel against me. I, the Lord, have spoken!°Ø°±
24Jr 30:1 The Lord gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, 
24Jr 30:2 °∞This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says£∫ Write down for the record everything I have said to you, Jeremiah. 
24Jr 30:3 For the time is coming when I will restore the fortunes of my people of Israel and Judah. I will bring them home to this land that I gave to their ancestors, and they will possess it again. I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
24Jr 30:4 This is the message the Lord gave concerning Israel and Judah. 
24Jr 30:5 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞I hear cries of fear; there is terror and no peace.
24Jr 30:6 Now let me ask you a question£∫ Do men give birth to babies? Then why do they stand there, ashen-faced, hands pressed against their sides like a woman in labor?
24Jr 30:7 In all history there has never been such a time of terror. It will be a time of trouble for my people Israel®Á. Yet in the end they will be saved! / ®ÁHebrew Jacob; also in 30.10b, 18. See note on 5.20.
24Jr 30:8 For in that day,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, °∞I will break the yoke from their necks and snap their chains. Foreigners will no longer be their masters.
24Jr 30:9 For my people will serve the Lord their God and their king descended from David - the king I will raise up for them.
24Jr 30:10 °∞So do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant; do not be dismayed, Israel,°± says the Lord. °∞For I will bring you home again from distant lands, and your children will return from their exile. Israel will return to a life of peace and quiet, and no one will terrorize them.
24Jr 30:11 For I am with you and will save you,°± says the Lord. °∞I will completely destroy the nations where I have scattered you, but I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you, but with justice; I cannot let you go unpunished.°±
24Jr 30:12 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Your injury is incurable - a terrible wound.
24Jr 30:13 There is no one to help you or to bind up your injury. No medicine can heal you.
24Jr 30:14 All your lovers - your allies - have left you and do not care about you anymore. I have wounded you cruelly, as though I were your enemy. For your sins are many, and your guilt is great.
24Jr 30:15 Why do you protest your punishment - this wound that has no cure? I have had to punish you because your sins are many and your guilt is great.
24Jr 30:16 °∞But all who devour you will be devoured, and all your enemies will be sent into exile. All who plunder you will be plundered, and all who attack you will be attacked.
24Jr 30:17 I will give you back your health and heal your wounds,°± says the Lord. °∞For you are called an outcast - °ÆJerusalem®Á for whom no one cares.°Ø°± / ®ÁHebrew Zion.
24Jr 30:18 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞When I bring Israel home again from captivity and restore their fortunes, Jerusalem will be rebuilt on its ruins, and the palace reconstructed as before.
24Jr 30:19 There will be joy and songs of thanksgiving, and I will multiply my people, not diminish them; I will honor them, not despise them.
24Jr 30:20 Their children will prosper as they did long ago. I will establish them as a nation before me, and I will punish anyone who hurts them.
24Jr 30:21 They will have their own ruler again, and he will come from their own people. I will invite him to approach me,°± says the Lord, °∞for who would dare to come unless invited?
24Jr 30:22 You will be my people, and I will be your God.°±
24Jr 30:23 Look! The Lord°Øs anger bursts out like a storm, a driving wind that swirls down on the heads of the wicked.
24Jr 30:24 The fierce anger of the Lord will not diminish until it has finished all he has planned. In the days to come you will understand all this.
24Jr 31:1 °∞In that day,°± says the Lord, °∞I will be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people. 
24Jr 31:2 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Those who survive the coming destruction will find blessings even in the barren land, for I will give rest to the people of Israel.°±
24Jr 31:3 Long ago the Lord said to Israel£∫ °∞I have loved you, my people, with an everlasting love. With unfailing love I have drawn you to myself.
24Jr 31:4 I will rebuild you, my virgin Israel. You will again be happy and dance merrily with your tambourines.
24Jr 31:5 Again you will plant your vineyards on the mountains of Samaria and eat from your own gardens there.
24Jr 31:6 The day will come when watchmen will shout from the hill country of Ephraim, °ÆCome, let us go up to Jerusalem®Á to worship the Lord our God.°Ø°± / ®ÁHebrew Zion; also in 31.12.
24Jr 31:7 Now this is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Sing with joy for Israel®Á. Shout for the greatest of nations! Shout out with praise and joy£∫ °ÆSave your people, O Lord, the remnant of Israel!°Ø / ®ÁHebrew Jacob; also in 31.11. See note on 5.20.
24Jr 31:8 For I will bring them from the north and from the distant corners of the earth. I will not forget the blind and lame, the expectant mothers and women in labor. A great company will return!
24Jr 31:9 Tears of joy will stream down their faces, and I will lead them home with great care. They will walk beside quiet streams and on smooth paths where they will not stumble. For I am Israel°Øs father, and Ephraim is my oldest child.
24Jr 31:10 °∞Listen to this message from the Lord, you nations of the world; proclaim it in distant coastlands£∫ The Lord, who scattered his people, will gather them and watch over them as a shepherd does his flock.
24Jr 31:11 For the Lord has redeemed Israel from those too strong for them.
24Jr 31:12 They will come home and sing songs of joy on the heights of Jerusalem. They will be radiant because of the Lord°Øs good gifts - the abundant crops of grain, new wine, and olive oil, and the healthy flocks and herds. Their life will be like a watered garden, and all their sorrows will be gone.
24Jr 31:13 The young women will dance for joy, and the men - old and young - will join in the celebration. I will turn their mourning into joy. I will comfort them and exchange their sorrow for rejoicing.
24Jr 31:14 The priests will enjoy abundance, and my people will feast on my good gifts. I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
24Jr 31:15 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞A cry is heard in Ramah - deep anguish and bitter weeping. Rachel weeps for her children, refusing to be comforted - for her children are gone.°±
24Jr 31:16 But now this is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Do not weep any longer, for I will reward you,°± says the Lord. °∞Your children will come back to you from the distant land of the enemy.
24Jr 31:17 There is hope for your future,°± says the Lord. °∞Your children will come again to their own land.
24Jr 31:18 I have heard Israel®Á saying, °ÆYou disciplined me severely, like a calf that needs training for the yoke. Turn me again to you and restore me, for you alone are the Lord my God. / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel; also in 31.20.
24Jr 31:19 I turned away from God, but then I was sorry. I kicked myself for my stupidity! I was thoroughly ashamed of all I did in my younger days.°Ø
24Jr 31:20 °∞Is not Israel still my son, my darling child?°± says the Lord. °∞I often have to punish him, but I still love him. That°Øs why I long for him and surely will have mercy on him.
24Jr 31:21 Set up road signs; put up guideposts. Mark well the path by which you came. Come back again, my virgin Israel; return to your towns here.
24Jr 31:22 How long will you wander, my wayward daughter? For the Lord will cause something new to happen - Israel will embrace her God®Á.°± / ®ÁHebrew a woman will court a suitor.
24Jr 31:23 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °∞When I bring them back from captivity, the people of Judah and its towns will again say, °ÆThe Lord bless you, O righteous home, O holy mountain!°Ø 
24Jr 31:24 Townspeople and farmers and shepherds alike will live together in peace and happiness. 
24Jr 31:25 For I have given rest to the weary and joy to the sorrowing.°±
24Jr 31:26 At this, I woke up and looked around. My sleep had been very sweet.
24Jr 31:27 °∞The day is coming,°± says the Lord, °∞when I will greatly increase the human population and the number of animals here in Israel and Judah. 
24Jr 31:28 In the past I deliberately uprooted and tore down this nation. I overthrew it, destroyed it, and brought disaster upon it. But in the future I will just as deliberately plant it and build it up. I, the Lord, have spoken!
24Jr 31:29 °∞The people will no longer quote this proverb£∫ °ÆThe parents have eaten sour grapes, but their children°Øs mouths pucker at the taste.°Ø
24Jr 31:30 All people will die for their own sins - those who eat the sour grapes will be the ones whose mouths will pucker.
24Jr 31:31 °∞The day is coming,°± says the Lord, °∞when I will make a new covenant with the people of Israel and Judah. 
24Jr 31:32 This covenant will not be like the one I made with their ancestors when I took them by the hand and brought them out of the land of Egypt. They broke that covenant, though I loved them as a husband loves his wife,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 31:33 °∞But this is the new covenant I will make with the people of Israel on that day,°± says the Lord. °∞I will put my instructions deep within them, and I will write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
24Jr 31:34 And they will not need to teach their neighbors, nor will they need to teach their relatives, saying, °ÆYou should know the Lord.°Ø For everyone, from the least to the greatest, will know me already,°± says the Lord. °∞And I will forgive their wickedness, and I will never again remember their sins.°±
24Jr 31:35 It is the Lord who provides the sun to light the day and the moon and stars to light the night, and who stirs the sea into roaring waves. His name is the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, and this is what he says.
24Jr 31:36 °∞I am as likely to reject my people Israel as I am to abolish the laws of nature!°±
24Jr 31:37 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Just as the heavens cannot be measured and the foundations of the earth cannot be explored, so I will not consider casting them away for the evil they have done. I, the Lord, have spoken!
24Jr 31:38 °∞The day is coming,°± says the Lord, °∞when all Jerusalem will be rebuilt for me, from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate. 
24Jr 31:39 A measuring line will be stretched out over the hill of Gareb and across to Goah. 
24Jr 31:40 And the entire area - including the graveyard and ash dump in the valley, and all the fields out to the Kidron Valley on the east as far as the Horse Gate - will be holy to the Lord. The city will never again be captured or destroyed.°±
24Jr 32:1 The following message came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of the reign of Zedekiah®Á, king of Judah. This was also the eighteenth year of the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar®Ë. / ®ÁThe tenth year of Zedekiah°Øs reign and the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar°Øs reign was 587 b.c. ®ËHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar; also in 32.28.
24Jr 32:2 Jerusalem was then under siege from the Babylonian army, and Jeremiah was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace. 
24Jr 32:3 King Zedekiah had put him there, asking why he kept giving this prophecy£∫ °∞This is what the Lord says£∫ °ÆI am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will take it. 
24Jr 32:4 King Zedekiah will be captured by the Babylonians®Á and taken to meet the king of Babylon face to face. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans; also in 32.5, 24, 25, 28, 29, 43.
24Jr 32:5 He will take Zedekiah to Babylon, and I will deal with him there,°Ø says the Lord. °ÆIf you fight against the Babylonians, you will never succeed.°Ø°±
24Jr 32:6 At that time the Lord sent me a message. He said, 
24Jr 32:7 °∞Your cousin Hanamel son of Shallum will come and say to you, °ÆBuy my field at Anathoth. By law you have the right to buy it before it is offered to anyone else.°Ø°±
24Jr 32:8 Then, just as the Lord had said he would, my cousin Hanamel came and visited me in the prison. He said, °∞Please buy my field at Anathoth in the land of Benjamin. By law you have the right to buy it before it is offered to anyone else, so buy it for yourself.°± Then I knew that the message I had heard was from the Lord.
24Jr 32:9 So I bought the field at Anathoth, paying Hanamel seventeen pieces®Á of silver for it. / ®ÁHebrew 17 shekels, about 7 ounces or 194 grams in weight.
24Jr 32:10 I signed and sealed the deed of purchase before witnesses, weighed out the silver, and paid him. 
24Jr 32:11 Then I took the sealed deed and an unsealed copy of the deed, which contained the terms and conditions of the purchase, 
24Jr 32:12 and I handed them to Baruch son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah. I did all this in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, the witnesses who had signed the deed, and all the men of Judah who were there in the courtyard of the guardhouse.
24Jr 32:13 Then I said to Baruch as they all listened, 
24Jr 32:14 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °ÆTake both this sealed deed and the unsealed copy, and put them into a pottery jar to preserve them for a long time.°Ø 
24Jr 32:15 For this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °ÆSomeday people will again own property here in this land and will buy and sell houses and vineyards and fields.°Ø°±
24Jr 32:16 Then after I had given the papers to Baruch, I prayed to the Lord.
24Jr 32:17 °∞O Sovereign Lord! You made the heavens and earth by your strong hand and powerful arm. Nothing is too hard for you! 
24Jr 32:18 You show unfailing love to thousands, but you also bring the consequences of one generation°Øs sin upon the next. You are the great and powerful God, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. 
24Jr 32:19 You have all wisdom and do great and mighty miracles. You see the conduct of all people, and you give them what they deserve. 
24Jr 32:20 You performed miraculous signs and wonders in the land of Egypt - things still remembered to this day! And you have continued to do great miracles in Israel and all around the world. You have made your name famous to this day.
24Jr 32:21 °∞You brought Israel out of Egypt with mighty signs and wonders, with a strong hand and powerful arm, and with overwhelming terror. 
24Jr 32:22 You gave the people of Israel this land that you had promised their ancestors long before - a land flowing with milk and honey. 
24Jr 32:23 Our ancestors came and conquered it and lived in it, but they refused to obey you or follow your word. They have not done anything you commanded. That is why you have sent this terrible disaster upon them.
24Jr 32:24 °∞See how the siege ramps have been built against the city walls! Through war, famine, and disease, the city will be handed over to the Babylonians, who will conquer it. Everything has happened just as you said. 
24Jr 32:25 And yet, O Sovereign Lord, you have told me to buy the field - paying good money for it before these witnesses - even though the city will soon be handed over to the Babylonians.°±
24Jr 32:26 Then this message came to Jeremiah from the Lord£∫ 
24Jr 32:27 °∞I am the Lord, the God of all the peoples of the world. Is anything too hard for me? 
24Jr 32:28 Therefore, this is what the Lord says£∫ I will hand this city over to the Babylonians and to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and he will capture it. 
24Jr 32:29 The Babylonians outside the walls will come in and set fire to the city. They will burn down all these houses where the people provoked my anger by burning incense to Baal on the rooftops and by pouring out liquid offerings to other gods. 
24Jr 32:30 Israel and Judah have done nothing but wrong since their earliest days. They have infuriated me with all their evil deeds,°± says the Lord. 
24Jr 32:31 °∞From the time this city was built until now, it has done nothing but anger me, so I am determined to get rid of it.
24Jr 32:32 °∞The sins of Israel and Judah - the sins of the people of Jerusalem, the kings, the officials, the priests, and the prophets - have stirred up my anger. 
24Jr 32:33 My people have turned their backs on me and have refused to return. Even though I diligently taught them, they would not receive instruction or obey. 
24Jr 32:34 They have set up their abominable idols right in my own Temple, defiling it. 
24Jr 32:35 They have built pagan shrines to Baal in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, and there they sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech. I have never commanded such a horrible deed; it never even crossed my mind to command such a thing. What an incredible evil, causing Judah to sin so greatly!
24Jr 32:36 °∞Now I want to say something more about this city. You have been saying, °ÆIt will fall to the king of Babylon through war, famine, and disease.°Ø But this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says£∫ 
24Jr 32:37 I will certainly bring my people back again from all the countries where I will scatter them in my fury. I will bring them back to this very city and let them live in peace and safety. 
24Jr 32:38 They will be my people, and I will be their God. 
24Jr 32:39 And I will give them one heart and one purpose£∫ to worship me forever, for their own good and for the good of all their descendants. 
24Jr 32:40 And I will make an everlasting covenant with them£∫ I will never stop doing good for them. I will put a desire in their hearts to worship me, and they will never leave me. 
24Jr 32:41 I will find joy doing good for them and will faithfully and wholeheartedly replant them in this land.
24Jr 32:42 °∞This is what the Lord says£∫ Just as I have brought all these calamities on them, so I will do all the good I have promised them. 
24Jr 32:43 Fields will again be bought and sold in this land about which you now say, °ÆIt has been ravaged by the Babylonians, a desolate land where people and animals have all disappeared.°Ø 
24Jr 32:44 Yes, fields will once again be bought and sold - deeds signed and sealed and witnessed - in the land of Benjamin and here in Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah and in the hill country, in the foothills of Judah®Á and in the Negev, too. For someday I will restore prosperity to them. I, the Lord, have spoken!°± / ®ÁHebrew the Shephelah.
24Jr 33:1 While Jeremiah was still confined in the courtyard of the guard, the Lord gave him this second message£∫ 
24Jr 33:2 °∞This is what the Lord says - the Lord who made the earth, who formed and established it, whose name is the Lord£∫ 
24Jr 33:3 Ask me and I will tell you remarkable secrets you do not know about things to come. 
24Jr 33:4 For this is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says£∫ You have torn down the houses of this city and even the king°Øs palace to get materials to strengthen the walls against the siege ramps and swords of the enemy. 
24Jr 33:5 You expect to fight the Babylonians®Á, but the men of this city are already as good as dead, for I have determined to destroy them in my terrible anger. I have abandoned them because of all their wickedness. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans.
24Jr 33:6 °∞Nevertheless, the time will come when I will heal Jerusalem°Øs wounds and give it prosperity and true peace. 
24Jr 33:7 I will restore the fortunes of Judah and Israel and rebuild their towns. 
24Jr 33:8 I will cleanse them of their sins against me and forgive all their sins of rebellion. 
24Jr 33:9 Then this city will bring me joy, glory, and honor before all the nations of the earth! The people of the world will see all the good I do for my people, and they will tremble with awe at the peace and prosperity I provide for them.
24Jr 33:10 °∞This is what the Lord says£∫ You have said, °ÆThis is a desolate land where people and animals have all disappeared.°Ø Yet in the empty streets of Jerusalem and Judah°Øs other towns, there will be heard once more 
24Jr 33:11 the sounds of joy and laughter. The joyful voices of bridegrooms and brides will be heard again, along with the joyous songs of people bringing thanksgiving offerings to the Lord. They will sing, °ÆGive thanks to the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, for the Lord is good. His faithful love endures forever!°Ø For I will restore the prosperity of this land to what it was in the past, says the Lord.
24Jr 33:12 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ This land - though it is now desolate and has no people and animals - will once more have pastures where shepherds can lead their flocks. 
24Jr 33:13 Once again shepherds will count their flocks in the towns of the hill country, the foothills of Judah®Á, the Negev, the land of Benjamin, the vicinity of Jerusalem, and all the towns of Judah. I, the Lord, have spoken! / ®ÁHebrew the Shephelah.
24Jr 33:14 °∞The day will come, says the Lord, when I will do for Israel and Judah all the good things I have promised them.
24Jr 33:15 °∞In those days and at that time I will raise up a righteous descendant®Á from King David°Øs line. He will do what is just and right throughout the land. / ®ÁHebrew a righteous branch.
24Jr 33:16 In that day Judah will be saved, and Jerusalem will live in safety. And this will be its name£∫ °ÆThe Lord Is Our Righteousness.°Ø®Á / ®ÁHebrew Yahweh Tsidqenu.
24Jr 33:17 For this is what the Lord says£∫ David will have a descendant sitting on the throne of Israel forever. 
24Jr 33:18 And there will always be Levitical priests to offer burnt offerings and grain offerings and sacrifices to me.°±
24Jr 33:19 Then this message came to Jeremiah from the Lord£∫ 
24Jr 33:20 °∞This is what the Lord says£∫ If you can break my covenant with the day and the night so that one does not follow the other, 
24Jr 33:21 only then will my covenant with my servant David be broken. Only then will he no longer have a descendant to reign on his throne. The same is true for my covenant with the Levitical priests who minister before me. 
24Jr 33:22 And as the stars of the sky cannot be counted and the sand on the seashore cannot be measured, so I will multiply the descendants of my servant David and the Levites who minister before me.°±
24Jr 33:23 The Lord gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, 
24Jr 33:24 °∞Have you noticed what people are saying? - °ÆThe Lord chose Judah and Israel and then abandoned them!°Ø They are sneering and saying that Israel is not worthy to be counted as a nation. 
24Jr 33:25 But this is what the Lord says£∫ I would no more reject my people than I would change my laws that govern night and day, earth and sky. 
24Jr 33:26 I will never abandon the descendants of Jacob or David, my servant, or change the plan that David°Øs descendants will rule the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Instead, I will restore them to their land and have mercy on them.°±
24Jr 34:1 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came with all the armies from the kingdoms he ruled, and he fought against Jerusalem and the towns of Judah. At that time this message came to Jeremiah from the Lord£∫ 
24Jr 34:2 °∞Go to King Zedekiah of Judah, and tell him, °ÆThis is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says£∫ I am about to hand this city over to the king of Babylon, and he will burn it down. 
24Jr 34:3 You will not escape his grasp but will be captured and taken to meet the king of Babylon face to face. Then you will be exiled to Babylon.
24Jr 34:4 °∞°ÆBut listen to this promise from the Lord, O Zedekiah, king of Judah. This is what the Lord says£∫ You will not be killed in war 
24Jr 34:5 but will die peacefully. People will burn incense in your memory, just as they did for your ancestors, the kings who preceded you. They will mourn for you, crying, °∞Alas, our master is dead!°± This I have decreed, says the Lord.°Ø°±
24Jr 34:6 So Jeremiah the prophet delivered the message to King Zedekiah of Judah. 
24Jr 34:7 At this time the Babylonian army was besieging Jerusalem, Lachish, and Azekah - the only fortified cities of Judah not yet captured.
24Jr 34:8 This message came to Jeremiah from the Lord after King Zedekiah made a covenant with the people, proclaiming freedom for the slaves. 
24Jr 34:9 He had ordered all the people to free their Hebrew slaves - both men and women. No one was to keep a fellow Judean in bondage. 
24Jr 34:10 The officials and all the people had obeyed the king°Øs command, 
24Jr 34:11 but later they changed their minds. They took back the men and women they had freed, forcing them to be slaves again.
24Jr 34:12 So the Lord gave them this message through Jeremiah£∫ 
24Jr 34:13 °∞This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says£∫ I made a covenant with your ancestors long ago when I rescued them from their slavery in Egypt. 
24Jr 34:14 I told them that every Hebrew slave must be freed after serving six years. But your ancestors paid no attention to me. 
24Jr 34:15 Recently you repented and did what was right, following my command. You freed your slaves and made a solemn covenant with me in the Temple that bears my name. 
24Jr 34:16 But now you have shrugged off your oath and defiled my name by taking back the men and women you had freed, forcing them to be slaves once again.
24Jr 34:17 °∞Therefore, this is what the Lord says£∫ Since you have not obeyed me by setting your countrymen free, I will set you free to be destroyed by war, disease, and famine. You will be an object of horror to all the nations of the earth. 
24Jr 34:18 Because you have broken the terms of our covenant, I will cut you apart just as you cut apart the calf when you walked between its halves to solemnize your vows. 
24Jr 34:19 Yes, I will cut you apart, whether you are officials of Judah or Jerusalem, court officials, priests, or common people - for you have broken your oath. 
24Jr 34:20 I will give you to your enemies, and they will kill you. Your bodies will be food for the vultures and wild animals.
24Jr 34:21 °∞I will hand over King Zedekiah of Judah and his officials to the army of the king of Babylon. And although Babylon°Øs king has left Jerusalem for a while, 
24Jr 34:22 I will call the Babylonian armies back again. They will fight against this city and will capture it and burn it down. I will see to it that all the towns of Judah are destroyed, with no one living there.°±
24Jr 35:1 This is the message the Lord gave Jeremiah when Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king of Judah£∫ 
24Jr 35:2 °∞Go to the settlement where the families of the Recabites live, and invite them to the Lord°Øs Temple. Take them into one of the inner rooms, and offer them some wine.°±
24Jr 35:3 So I went to see Jaazaniah son of Jeremiah and grandson of Habazziniah and all his brothers and sons - representing all the Recabite families. 
24Jr 35:4 I took them to the Temple, and we went into the room assigned to the sons of Hanan son of Igdaliah, a man of God. This room was located next to the one used by the Temple officials, directly above the room of Maaseiah son of Shallum, the Temple gatekeeper.
24Jr 35:5 I set cups and jugs of wine before them and invited them to have a drink, 
24Jr 35:6 but they refused. °∞No,°± they said, °∞we don°Øt drink wine, because our ancestor Jehonadab®Á son of Recab gave us this command£∫ °ÆYou and your descendants must never drink wine. / ®ÁHebrew Jonadab, a variant spelling of Jehonadab; also in 35.10, 14, 16, 18, 19. See 2 Kgs 10.15.
24Jr 35:7 And do not build houses or plant crops or vineyards, but always live in tents. If you follow these commands, you will live long, good lives in the land.°Ø 
24Jr 35:8 So we have obeyed him in all these things. We have never had a drink of wine to this day, nor have our wives, our sons, or our daughters. 
24Jr 35:9 We haven°Øt built houses or owned vineyards or farms or planted crops. 
24Jr 35:10 We have lived in tents and have fully obeyed all the commands of Jehonadab, our ancestor. 
24Jr 35:11 But when King Nebuchadnezzar®Á of Babylon attacked this country, we were afraid of the Babylonian and Syrian®Ë armies. So we decided to move to Jerusalem. That is why we are here.°± / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar. ®ËOr Chaldean and Aramean.
24Jr 35:12 Then the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah£∫ 
24Jr 35:13 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ Go and say to the people in Judah and Jerusalem, °ÆCome and learn a lesson about how to obey me. 
24Jr 35:14 The Recabites do not drink wine to this day because their ancestor Jehonadab told them not to. But I have spoken to you again and again, and you refuse to obey me. 
24Jr 35:15 Time after time I sent you prophets, who told you, °∞Turn from your wicked ways, and start doing things right. Stop worshiping other gods so that you might live in peace here in the land I have given to you and your ancestors.°± But you would not listen to me or obey me. 
24Jr 35:16 The descendants of Jehonadab son of Recab have obeyed their ancestor completely, but you have refused to listen to me.°Ø
24Jr 35:17 °∞Therefore, this is what the Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °ÆBecause you refuse to listen or answer when I call, I will send upon Judah and Jerusalem all the disasters I have threatened.°Ø°±
24Jr 35:18 Then Jeremiah turned to the Recabites and said, °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °ÆYou have obeyed your ancestor Jehonadab in every respect, following all his instructions.°Ø 
24Jr 35:19 Therefore, this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °ÆJehonadab son of Recab will always have descendants who serve me.°Ø°±
24Jr 36:1 During the fourth year that Jehoiakim son of Josiah was king in Judah®Á, the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah£∫ / ®ÁThe fourth year of Jehoiakim°Øs reign was 605 b.c.
24Jr 36:2 °∞Get a scroll, and write down all my messages against Israel, Judah, and the other nations. Begin with the first message back in the days of Josiah, and write down every message, right up to the present time. 
24Jr 36:3 Perhaps the people of Judah will repent when they hear again all the terrible things I have planned for them. Then I will be able to forgive their sins and wrongdoings.°±
24Jr 36:4 So Jeremiah sent for Baruch son of Neriah, and as Jeremiah dictated all the prophecies that the Lord had given him, Baruch wrote them on a scroll. 
24Jr 36:5 Then Jeremiah said to Baruch, °∞I am a prisoner here and unable to go to the Temple. 
24Jr 36:6 So you go to the Temple on the next day of fasting, and read the messages from the Lord that I have had you write on this scroll. Read them so the people who are there from all over Judah will hear them. 
24Jr 36:7 Perhaps even yet they will turn from their evil ways and ask the Lord°Øs forgiveness before it is too late. For the Lord has threatened them with his terrible anger.°±
24Jr 36:8 Baruch did as Jeremiah told him and read these messages from the Lord to the people at the Temple. 
24Jr 36:9 He did this on a day of sacred fasting held in late autumn®Á, during the fifth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah. People from all over Judah had come to Jerusalem to attend the services at the Temple on that day. / ®ÁHebrew in the ninth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar (also in 36.22). The ninth month in the fifth year of Jehoiakim°Øs reign occurred within the months of November and December 604 b.c. Also see note on 1.3.
24Jr 36:10 Baruch read Jeremiah°Øs words on the scroll to all the people. He stood in front of the Temple room of Gemariah, son of Shaphan the secretary. This room was just off the upper courtyard of the Temple, near the New Gate entrance.
24Jr 36:11 When Micaiah son of Gemariah and grandson of Shaphan heard the messages from the Lord, 
24Jr 36:12 he went down to the secretary°Øs room in the palace where the administrative officials were meeting. Elishama the secretary was there, along with Delaiah son of Shemaiah, Elnathan son of Acbor, Gemariah son of Shaphan, Zedekiah son of Hananiah, and all the other officials. 
24Jr 36:13 When Micaiah told them about the messages Baruch was reading to the people, 
24Jr 36:14 the officials sent Jehudi son of Nethaniah, grandson of Shelemiah and great-grandson of Cushi, to ask Baruch to come and read the messages to them, too. So Baruch took the scroll and went to them. 
24Jr 36:15 °∞Sit down and read the scroll to us,°± the officials said, and Baruch did as they requested.
24Jr 36:16 When they heard all the messages, they looked at one another in alarm. °∞We must tell the king what we have heard,°± they said to Baruch. 
24Jr 36:17 °∞But first, tell us how you got these messages. Did they come directly from Jeremiah?°±
24Jr 36:18 So Baruch explained, °∞Jeremiah dictated them, and I wrote them down in ink, word for word, on this scroll.°±
24Jr 36:19 °∞You and Jeremiah should both hide,°± the officials told Baruch. °∞Don°Øt tell anyone where you are!°± 
24Jr 36:20 Then the officials left the scroll for safekeeping in the room of Elishama the secretary and went to tell the king what had happened.
24Jr 36:21 The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll. Jehudi brought it from Elishama°Øs room and read it to the king as all his officials stood by. 
24Jr 36:22 It was late autumn, and the king was in a winterized part of the palace, sitting in front of a fire to keep warm. 
24Jr 36:23 Each time Jehudi finished reading three or four columns, the king took a knife and cut off that section of the scroll. He then threw it into the fire, section by section, until the whole scroll was burned up. 
24Jr 36:24 Neither the king nor his attendants showed any signs of fear or repentance at what they heard. 
24Jr 36:25 Even when Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah begged the king not to burn the scroll, he wouldn°Øt listen.
24Jr 36:26 Then the king commanded his son Jerahmeel, Seraiah son of Azriel, and Shelemiah son of Abdeel to arrest Baruch and Jeremiah. But the Lord had hidden them.
24Jr 36:27 After the king had burned the scroll on which Baruch had written Jeremiah°Øs words, the Lord gave Jeremiah another message. He said, 
24Jr 36:28 °∞Get another scroll, and write everything again just as you did on the scroll King Jehoiakim burned. 
24Jr 36:29 Then say to the king, °ÆThis is what the Lord says£∫ You burned the scroll because it said the king of Babylon would destroy this land and empty it of people and animals. 
24Jr 36:30 Now this is what the Lord says about King Jehoiakim of Judah£∫ He will have no heirs to sit on the throne of David. His dead body will be thrown out to lie unburied - exposed to the heat of the day and the frost of the night. 
24Jr 36:31 I will punish him and his family and his attendants for their sins. I will pour out on them and on all the people of Jerusalem and Judah all the disasters I promised, for they would not listen to my warnings.°Ø°±
24Jr 36:32 So Jeremiah took another scroll and dictated again to his secretary, Baruch. He wrote everything that had been on the scroll King Jehoiakim had burned in the fire. Only this time he added much more!
24Jr 37:1 Zedekiah son of Josiah succeeded Jehoiachin®Á son of Jehoiakim as the king of Judah. He was appointed by King Nebuchadnezzar®Ë of Babylon. / ®ÁHebrew Coniah, a variant spelling of Jehoiachin. ®ËHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar.
24Jr 37:2 But neither King Zedekiah nor his attendants nor the people who were left in the land listened to what the Lord said through Jeremiah.
24Jr 37:3 Nevertheless, King Zedekiah sent Jehucal son of Shelemiah, and Zephaniah the priest, son of Maaseiah, to ask Jeremiah, °∞Please pray to the Lord our God for us.°± 
24Jr 37:4 Jeremiah had not yet been imprisoned, so he could come and go among the people as he pleased.
24Jr 37:5 At this time the army of Pharaoh Hophra®Á of Egypt appeared at the southern border of Judah. When the Babylonian®Ë army heard about it, they withdrew from their siege of Jerusalem. / ®ÁHebrew army of Pharaoh; see 44.30. ®ËOr Chaldean; also in 37.10, 11.
24Jr 37:6 Then the Lord gave this message to Jeremiah£∫ 
24Jr 37:7 °∞This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says£∫ The king of Judah sent you to ask me what is going to happen. Tell him, °ÆPharaoh°Øs army is about to return to Egypt, though he came here to help you. 
24Jr 37:8 Then the Babylonians®Á will come back and capture this city and burn it to the ground.°Ø / ®ÁOr Chaldeans; also in 37.9, 13.
24Jr 37:9 °∞This is what the Lord says£∫ Do not fool yourselves into thinking that the Babylonians are gone for good. They aren°Øt! 
24Jr 37:10 Even if you were to destroy the entire Babylonian army, leaving only a handful of wounded survivors, they would still stagger from their tents and burn this city to the ground!°±
24Jr 37:11 When the Babylonian army left Jerusalem because of Pharaoh°Øs approaching army, 
24Jr 37:12 Jeremiah started to leave the city on his way to the territory of Benjamin, to claim his share of the property among his relatives there®Á. / ®ÁHebrew to separate from there in the midst of the people.
24Jr 37:13 But as he was walking through the Benjamin Gate, a sentry arrested him and said, °∞You are defecting to the Babylonians!°± The sentry making the arrest was Irijah son of Shelemiah, grandson of Hananiah.
24Jr 37:14 °∞That°Øs not true!°± Jeremiah protested. °∞I had no intention of doing any such thing.°± But Irijah wouldn°Øt listen, and he took Jeremiah before the officials. 
24Jr 37:15 They were furious with Jeremiah and had him flogged and imprisoned in the house of Jonathan the secretary. Jonathan°Øs house had been converted into a prison. 
24Jr 37:16 Jeremiah was put into a dungeon cell, where he remained for many days.
24Jr 37:17 Later King Zedekiah secretly requested that Jeremiah come to the palace, where the king asked him, °∞Do you have any messages from the Lord?°± °∞Yes, I do!°± said Jeremiah. °∞You will be defeated by the king of Babylon.°±
24Jr 37:18 Then Jeremiah asked the king, °∞What crime have I committed? What have I done against you, your attendants, or the people that I should be imprisoned like this? 
24Jr 37:19 Where are your prophets now who told you the king of Babylon would not attack you or this land? 
24Jr 37:20 Listen, my lord the king, I beg you. Don°Øt send me back to the dungeon in the house of Jonathan the secretary, for I will die there.°±
24Jr 37:21 So King Zedekiah commanded that Jeremiah not be returned to the dungeon. Instead, he was imprisoned in the courtyard of the guard in the royal palace. The king also commanded that Jeremiah be given a loaf of fresh bread every day as long as there was any left in the city. So Jeremiah was put in the palace prison.
24Jr 38:1 Now Shephatiah son of Mattan, Gedaliah son of Pashhur, Jehucal®Á son of Shelemiah, and Pashhur son of Malkijah heard what Jeremiah had been telling the people. He had been saying, / ®ÁHebrew Jucal, a variant spelling of Jehucal; see 37.3.
24Jr 38:2 °∞This is what the Lord says£∫ °ÆEveryone who stays in Jerusalem will die from war, famine, or disease, but those who surrender to the Babylonians®Á will live. Their reward will be life. They will live!°Ø / ®ÁOr Chaldeans; also in 38.18, 19, 23.
24Jr 38:3 The Lord also says£∫ °ÆThe city of Jerusalem will certainly be handed over to the army of the king of Babylon, who will capture it.°Ø°±
24Jr 38:4 So these officials went to the king and said, °∞Sir, this man must die! That kind of talk will undermine the morale of the few fighting men we have left, as well as that of all the people. This man is a traitor!°±
24Jr 38:5 King Zedekiah agreed. °∞All right,°± he said. °∞Do as you like. I can°Øt stop you.°±
24Jr 38:6 So the officials took Jeremiah from his cell and lowered him by ropes into an empty cistern in the prison yard. It belonged to Malkijah, a member of the royal family. There was no water in the cistern, but there was a thick layer of mud at the bottom, and Jeremiah sank down into it.
24Jr 38:7 But Ebed-melech the Ethiopian®Á, an important court official, heard that Jeremiah was in the cistern. At that time the king was holding court at the Benjamin Gate, / ®ÁHebrew the Cushite.
24Jr 38:8 so Ebed-melech rushed from the palace to speak with him. 
24Jr 38:9 °∞My lord the king,°± he said, °∞these men have done a very evil thing in putting Jeremiah the prophet into the cistern. He will soon die of hunger, for almost all the bread in the city is gone.°±
24Jr 38:10 So the king told Ebed-melech, °∞Take thirty of my men with you, and pull Jeremiah out of the cistern before he dies.°±
24Jr 38:11 So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to a room in the palace beneath the treasury, where he found some old rags and discarded clothing. He carried these to the cistern and lowered them to Jeremiah on a rope. 
24Jr 38:12 Ebed-melech called down to Jeremiah, °∞Put these rags under your armpits to protect you from the ropes.°± Then when Jeremiah was ready, 
24Jr 38:13 they pulled him out. So Jeremiah was returned to the courtyard of the guard - the palace prison - where he remained.
24Jr 38:14 One day King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah and had him brought to the third entrance of the Lord°Øs Temple. °∞I want to ask you something,°± the king said. °∞And don°Øt try to hide the truth.°±
24Jr 38:15 Jeremiah said, °∞If I tell you the truth, you will kill me. And if I give you advice, you won°Øt listen to me anyway.°±
24Jr 38:16 So King Zedekiah secretly promised him, °∞As surely as the Lord our Creator lives, I will not kill you or hand you over to the men who want you dead.°±
24Jr 38:17 Then Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, °∞This is what the Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °ÆIf you surrender to the Babylonian officers, you and your family will live, and the city will not be burned down. 
24Jr 38:18 But if you refuse to surrender, you will not escape! This city will be handed over to the Babylonians, and they will burn it to the ground.°Ø°±
24Jr 38:19 °∞But I am afraid to surrender,°± the king said, °∞for the Babylonians may hand me over to the Judeans who have defected to them. And who knows what they will do to me!°±
24Jr 38:20 Jeremiah replied, °∞You won°Øt be handed over to them if you choose to obey the Lord. Your life will be spared, and all will go well for you. 
24Jr 38:21 But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the Lord has revealed to me£∫ 
24Jr 38:22 All the women left in your palace will be brought out and given to the officers of the Babylonian army. Then the women will taunt you, saying, °ÆWhat fine friends you have! They have betrayed and misled you. When your feet sank in the mud, they left you to your fate!°Ø
24Jr 38:23 All your wives and children will be led out to the Babylonians, and you will not escape. You will be seized by the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned down.°±
24Jr 38:24 Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, °∞Don°Øt tell anyone you told me this, or you will die! 
24Jr 38:25 My officials may hear that I spoke to you, and they may say, °ÆTell us what you and the king were talking about. If you don°Øt tell us, we will kill you.°Ø 
24Jr 38:26 If this happens, just tell them you begged me not to send you back to Jonathan°Øs dungeon, for fear you would die there.°±
24Jr 38:27 Sure enough, it wasn°Øt long before the king°Øs officials came to Jeremiah and asked him why the king had called for him. But Jeremiah followed the king°Øs instructions, and they left without finding out the truth. No one had overheard the conversation between Jeremiah and the king. 
24Jr 38:28 And Jeremiah remained a prisoner in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.
24Jr 39:1 In January®Á of the ninth year of King Zedekiah°Øs reign, King Nebuchadnezzar®Ë came with his army to besiege Jerusalem. / ®ÁHebrew in the tenth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. A number of events in Jeremiah can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Babylonian records and related accurately to our modern calendar. This event occurred on January 15, 588 b.c.; see 52.4a and the note there. ®ËHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar; also in 39.11.
24Jr 39:2 Two and a half years later, on July 18®Á in the eleventh year of Zedekiah°Øs reign, the Babylonians broke through the wall, and the city fell. / ®ÁHebrew On the ninth day of the fourth month. This day was July 18, 586 b.c.; also see note on 39.1a.
24Jr 39:3 All the officers of the Babylonian army came in and sat in triumph at the Middle Gate£∫ Nergal-sharezer of Samgar, and Nebo-sarsekim®Á, a chief officer, and Nergal-sharezer, the king°Øs adviser, and all the other officers. / ®ÁOr Nergal-sharezer, Samgar-nebo, Sarsekim.
24Jr 39:4 When King Zedekiah and all the soldiers saw that the Babylonians had broken into the city, they fled. They waited for nightfall and then slipped through the gate between the two walls behind the king°Øs garden and headed toward the Jordan Valley®Á. / ®ÁHebrew the Arabah.
24Jr 39:5 But the Babylonian®Á troops chased the king and caught him on the plains of Jericho. They took him to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, who was at Riblah in the land of Hamath. There the king of Babylon pronounced judgment upon Zedekiah. / ®ÁOr Chaldean; similarly in 39.8.
24Jr 39:6 He made Zedekiah watch as they slaughtered his sons and all the nobles of Judah. 
24Jr 39:7 Then they gouged out Zedekiah°Øs eyes, bound him in bronze chains, and led him away to Babylon.
24Jr 39:8 Meanwhile, the Babylonians burned Jerusalem, including the palace, and tore down the walls of the city. 
24Jr 39:9 Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, sent to Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city as well as those who had defected to him. 
24Jr 39:10 But Nebuzaradan left a few of the poorest people in Judah, and he assigned them vineyards and fields to care for.
24Jr 39:11 King Nebuchadnezzar had told Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, to find Jeremiah. 
24Jr 39:12 °∞See that he isn°Øt hurt,°± he said. °∞Look after him well, and give him anything he wants.°± 
24Jr 39:13 So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard; Nebushazban, a chief officer; Nergal-sharezer, the king°Øs adviser; and the other officers of Babylon°Øs king 
24Jr 39:14 sent messengers to bring Jeremiah out of the prison. They put him under the care of Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan, who took him back to his home. So Jeremiah stayed in Judah among his own people.
24Jr 39:15 The Lord had given the following message to Jeremiah while he was still in prison£∫ 
24Jr 39:16 °∞Say to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian®Á, °ÆThis is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ I will do to this city everything I have threatened. I will send disaster, not prosperity. You will see its destruction, / ®ÁHebrew the Cushite.
24Jr 39:17 but I will rescue you from those you fear so much. 
24Jr 39:18 Because you trusted me, I will give you your life as a reward. I will rescue you and keep you safe. I, the Lord, have spoken!°Ø°±
24Jr 40:1 The Lord gave a message to Jeremiah after Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had released him at Ramah. He had found Jeremiah bound in chains among all the other captives of Jerusalem and Judah who were being sent to exile in Babylon.
24Jr 40:2 The captain of the guard called for Jeremiah and said, °∞The Lord your God has brought this disaster on this land, 
24Jr 40:3 just as he said he would. For these people have sinned against the Lord and disobeyed him. That is why it happened. 
24Jr 40:4 But I am going to take off your chains and let you go. If you want to come with me to Babylon, you are welcome. I will see that you are well cared for. But if you don°Øt want to come, you may stay here. The whole land is before you - go wherever you like. 
24Jr 40:5 If you decide to stay, then return to Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan. He has been appointed governor of Judah by the king of Babylon. Stay there with the people he rules. But it°Øs up to you; go wherever you like.°± Then Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, gave Jeremiah some food and money and let him go. 
24Jr 40:6 So Jeremiah returned to Gedaliah son of Ahikam at Mizpah, and he lived in Judah with the few who were still left in the land.
24Jr 40:7 The leaders of the Judean guerrilla bands in the countryside heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam as governor over the poor people who were left behind in Judah - the men, women, and children who hadn°Øt been exiled to Babylon. 
24Jr 40:8 So they went to see Gedaliah at Mizpah. These included£∫ Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan and Jonathan sons of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth, the sons of Ephai the Netophathite, Jezaniah son of the Maacathite, and all their men.
24Jr 40:9 Gedaliah vowed to them that the Babylonians®Á meant them no harm. °∞Don°Øt be afraid to serve them. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and all will go well for you,°± he promised. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans; also in 40.10.
24Jr 40:10 °∞As for me, I will stay at Mizpah to represent you before the Babylonians who come to meet with us. Settle in the towns you have taken, and live off the land. Harvest the grapes and summer fruits and olives, and store them away.°±
24Jr 40:11 When the Judeans in Moab, Ammon, Edom, and the other nearby countries heard that the king of Babylon had left a few people in Judah and that Gedaliah was the governor, 
24Jr 40:12 they began to return to Judah from the places to which they had fled. They stopped at Mizpah to meet with Gedaliah and then went into the Judean countryside to gather a great harvest of grapes and other crops.
24Jr 40:13 Soon after this, Johanan son of Kareah and the other guerrilla leaders came to Gedaliah at Mizpah. 
24Jr 40:14 They said to him, °∞Did you know that Baalis, king of Ammon, has sent Ishmael son of Nethaniah to assassinate you?°± But Gedaliah refused to believe them.
24Jr 40:15 Later Johanan had a private conference with Gedaliah and volunteered to kill Ishmael secretly. °∞Why should we let him come and murder you?°± Johanan asked. °∞What will happen then to the Judeans who have returned? Why should the few of us who are still left be scattered and lost?°±
24Jr 40:16 But Gedaliah said to Johanan, °∞I forbid you to do any such thing, for you are lying about Ishmael.°±
24Jr 41:1 But in midautumn®Á, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama, who was a member of the royal family and had been one of the king°Øs high officials, went to Mizpah with ten men to meet Gedaliah. While they were eating together, / ®ÁHebrew in the seventh month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This month occurred within the months of October and November 586 b.c.; also see note on 39.1a.
24Jr 41:2 Ishmael and his ten men suddenly jumped up, drew their swords, and killed Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylon had appointed governor. 
24Jr 41:3 Ishmael also killed all the Judeans and the Babylonian®Á soldiers who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah. / ®ÁOr Chaldean.
24Jr 41:4 The next day, before anyone had heard about Gedaliah°Øs murder, 
24Jr 41:5 eighty men arrived from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria to worship at the Temple of the Lord. They had shaved off their beards, torn their clothes, and cut themselves, and had brought along grain offerings and frankincense. 
24Jr 41:6 Ishmael left Mizpah to meet them, weeping as he went. When he reached them, he said, °∞Oh, come and see what has happened to Gedaliah!°±
24Jr 41:7 But as soon as they were all inside the town, Ishmael and his men killed all but ten of them and threw their bodies into a cistern. 
24Jr 41:8 The other ten had talked Ishmael into letting them go by promising to bring him their stores of wheat, barley, olive oil, and honey that they had hidden away. 
24Jr 41:9 The cistern where Ishmael dumped the bodies of the men he murdered was the large one dug by King Asa when he fortified Mizpah to protect himself against King Baasha of Israel. Ishmael son of Nethaniah filled it with corpses.
24Jr 41:10 Then Ishmael made captives of the king°Øs daughters and the other people who had been left under Gedaliah°Øs care in Mizpah by Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard. Taking them with him, he started back toward the land of Ammon.
24Jr 41:11 But when Johanan son of Kareah and the other guerrilla leaders heard about Ishmael°Øs crimes, 
24Jr 41:12 they took all their men and set out to stop him. They caught up with him at the large pool near Gibeon. 
24Jr 41:13 The people Ishmael had captured shouted for joy when they saw Johanan and the other guerrilla leaders. 
24Jr 41:14 And all the captives from Mizpah escaped and began to help Johanan. 
24Jr 41:15 Meanwhile, Ishmael and eight of his men escaped from Johanan into the land of Ammon.
24Jr 41:16 Then Johanan son of Kareah and the other guerrilla leaders took all the people they had rescued in Gibeon - the soldiers, women, children, and court officials®Á whom Ishmael had captured after he killed Gedaliah. / ®ÁOr eunuchs.
24Jr 41:17 They took them all to the village of Geruth-kimham near Bethlehem, where they prepared to leave for Egypt. 
24Jr 41:18 They were afraid of what the Babylonians®Á would do when they heard that Ishmael had killed Gedaliah, the governor appointed by the Babylonian king. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans.
24Jr 42:1 Then all the guerrilla leaders, including Johanan son of Kareah and Jezaniah®Á son of Hoshaiah, and all the people, from the least to the greatest, approached / ®ÁGreek version reads Azariah; compare 43.2.
24Jr 42:2 Jeremiah the prophet. They said, °∞Please pray to the Lord your God for us. As you can see, we are only a tiny remnant compared to what we were before. 
24Jr 42:3 Pray that the Lord your God will show us what to do and where to go.°±
24Jr 42:4 °∞All right,°± Jeremiah replied. °∞I will pray to the Lord your God, as you have asked, and I will tell you everything he says. I will hide nothing from you.°±
24Jr 42:5 Then they said to Jeremiah, °∞May the Lord your God be a faithful witness against us if we refuse to obey whatever he tells us to do! 
24Jr 42:6 Whether we like it or not, we will obey the Lord our God to whom we are sending you with our plea. For if we obey him, everything will turn out well for us.°±
24Jr 42:7 Ten days later the Lord gave his reply to Jeremiah. 
24Jr 42:8 So he called for Johanan son of Kareah and the other guerrilla leaders, and for all the people, from the least to the greatest. 
24Jr 42:9 He said to them, °∞You sent me to the Lord, the God of Israel, with your request, and this is his reply£∫ 
24Jr 42:10 °ÆStay here in this land. If you do, I will build you up and not tear you down; I will plant you and not uproot you. For I am sorry about all the punishment I have had to bring upon you. 
24Jr 42:11 Do not fear the king of Babylon anymore,°Ø says the Lord. °ÆFor I am with you and will save you and rescue you from his power. 
24Jr 42:12 I will be merciful to you by making him kind, so he will let you stay here in your land.°Ø
24Jr 42:13 °∞But if you refuse to obey the Lord your God, and if you say, °ÆWe will not stay here; 
24Jr 42:14 instead, we will go to Egypt where we will be free from war, the call to arms, and hunger,°Ø 
24Jr 42:15 then hear the Lord°Øs message to the remnant of Judah. This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °ÆIf you are determined to go to Egypt and live there, 
24Jr 42:16 the very war and famine you fear will catch up to you, and you will die there. 
24Jr 42:17 That is the fate awaiting every one of you who insists on going to live in Egypt. Yes, you will die from war, famine, and disease. None of you will escape the disaster I will bring upon you there.°Ø
24Jr 42:18 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °ÆJust as my anger and fury have been poured out on the people of Jerusalem, so they will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. You will be an object of damnation, horror, cursing, and mockery. And you will never see your homeland again.°Ø
24Jr 42:19 °∞Listen, you remnant of Judah. The Lord has told you£∫ °ÆDo not go to Egypt!°Ø Don°Øt forget this warning I have given you today. 
24Jr 42:20 For you were not being honest when you sent me to pray to the Lord your God for you. You said, °ÆJust tell us what the Lord our God says, and we will do it!°Ø 
24Jr 42:21 And today I have told you exactly what he said, but you will not obey the Lord your God any better now than you have in the past. 
24Jr 42:22 So you can be sure that you will die from war, famine, and disease in Egypt, where you insist on going.°±
24Jr 43:1 When Jeremiah had finished giving this message from the Lord their God to all the people, 
24Jr 43:2 Azariah son of Hoshaiah and Johanan son of Kareah and all the other proud men said to Jeremiah, °∞You lie! The Lord our God hasn°Øt forbidden us to go to Egypt! 
24Jr 43:3 Baruch son of Neriah has convinced you to say this, because he wants us to stay here and be killed by the Babylonians®Á or be carried off into exile.°± / ®ÁOr Chaldeans.
24Jr 43:4 So Johanan and the other guerrilla leaders and all the people refused to obey the Lord°Øs command to stay in Judah. 
24Jr 43:5 Johanan and the other leaders took with them all the people who had returned from the nearby countries to which they had fled. 
24Jr 43:6 In the crowd were men, women, and children, the king°Øs daughters, and all those whom Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, had left with Gedaliah. The prophet Jeremiah and Baruch were also included. 
24Jr 43:7 The people refused to obey the voice of the Lord and went to Egypt, going as far as the city of Tahpanhes.
24Jr 43:8 Then at Tahpanhes, the Lord gave another message to Jeremiah. He said, 
24Jr 43:9 °∞While the people of Judah are watching, take some large rocks and bury them under the pavement stones at the entrance of Pharaoh°Øs palace here in Tahpanhes. 
24Jr 43:10 Then say to the people of Judah, °ÆThis is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ I will certainly bring my servant Nebuchadnezzar®Á, king of Babylon, here to Egypt. I will set his throne over these stones that I have hidden. He will spread his royal canopy over them. / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar.
24Jr 43:11 And when he comes, he will destroy the land of Egypt. He will bring death to those destined for death, captivity to those destined for captivity, and war to those destined for war. 
24Jr 43:12 He will set fire to the temples of Egypt°Øs gods; he will burn the temples and carry the idols away as plunder. He will pick clean the land of Egypt as a shepherd picks fleas from his cloak. And he himself will leave unharmed. 
24Jr 43:13 He will break down the sacred pillars standing in the temple of the sun®Á in Egypt, and he will burn down the temples of Egypt°Øs gods.°Ø°± / ®ÁOr in Heliopolis.
24Jr 44:1 This is the message Jeremiah received concerning the Judeans living in northern Egypt in the cities of Migdol, Tahpanhes, and Memphis®Á, and in southern Egypt®Ë as well£∫ / ®ÁHebrew Noph. ®ËHebrew in Pathros.
24Jr 44:2 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ You saw the calamity I brought on Jerusalem and all the towns of Judah. They now lie deserted and in ruins. 
24Jr 44:3 They provoked my anger with all their wickedness. They burned incense and worshiped other gods - gods that neither they nor you nor any of your ancestors had ever even known.
24Jr 44:4 °∞Again and again I sent my servants, the prophets, to plead with them, °ÆDon°Øt do these horrible things that I hate so much.°Ø 
24Jr 44:5 But my people would not listen or turn back from their wicked ways. They kept on burning incense to these gods. 
24Jr 44:6 And so my fury boiled over and fell like fire on the towns of Judah and into the streets of Jerusalem, and they are still a desolate ruin today.
24Jr 44:7 °∞And now the Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, asks you£∫ Why are you destroying yourselves? For not one of you will survive - not a man, woman, or child among you who has come here from Judah, not even the babies in your arms. 
24Jr 44:8 Why provoke my anger by burning incense to the idols you have made here in Egypt? You will only destroy yourselves and make yourselves an object of cursing and mockery for all the nations of the earth. 
24Jr 44:9 Have you forgotten the sins of your ancestors, the sins of the kings and queens of Judah, and the sins you and your wives committed in Judah and Jerusalem? 
24Jr 44:10 To this very hour you have shown no remorse or reverence. No one has chosen to follow my word and the decrees I gave to you and your ancestors before you.
24Jr 44:11 °∞Therefore, this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ I am determined to destroy every one of you! 
24Jr 44:12 I will take this remnant of Judah - those who were determined to come here and live in Egypt - and I will consume them. They will fall here in Egypt, killed by war and famine. All will die, from the least to the greatest. They will be an object of damnation, horror, cursing, and mockery. 
24Jr 44:13 I will punish them in Egypt just as I punished them in Jerusalem, by war, famine, and disease. 
24Jr 44:14 Of that remnant who fled to Egypt, hoping someday to return to Judah, there will be no survivors. Even though they long to return home, only a handful will do so.°±
24Jr 44:15 Then all the women present and all the men who knew that their wives had burned incense to idols - a great crowd of all the Judeans living in northern Egypt and southern Egypt®Á - answered Jeremiah, / ®ÁHebrew in Egypt, in Pathros.
24Jr 44:16 °∞We will not listen to your messages from the Lord! 
24Jr 44:17 We will do whatever we want. We will burn incense and pour out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven just as much as we like - just as we, and our ancestors, and our kings and officials have always done in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. For in those days we had plenty to eat, and we were well off and had no troubles! 
24Jr 44:18 But ever since we quit burning incense to the Queen of Heaven and stopped worshiping her with liquid offerings, we have been in great trouble and have been dying from war and famine.°±
24Jr 44:19 °∞Besides,°± the women added, °∞do you suppose that we were burning incense and pouring out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven, and making cakes marked with her image, without our husbands knowing it and helping us? Of course not!°±
24Jr 44:20 Then Jeremiah said to all of them, men and women alike, who had given him that answer, 
24Jr 44:21 °∞Do you think the Lord did not know that you and your ancestors, your kings and officials, and all the people were burning incense to idols in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem? 
24Jr 44:22 It was because the Lord could no longer bear all the disgusting things you were doing that he made your land an object of cursing - a desolate ruin without inhabitants - as it is today. 
24Jr 44:23 All these terrible things happened to you because you have burned incense to idols and sinned against the Lord. You have refused to obey him and have not followed his instructions, his decrees, and his laws.°±
24Jr 44:24 Then Jeremiah said to them all, including the women, °∞Listen to this message from the Lord, all you citizens of Judah who live in Egypt. 
24Jr 44:25 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °ÆYou and your wives have said, °∞We will keep our promises to burn incense and pour out liquid offerings to the Queen of Heaven,°± and you have proved by your actions that you meant it. So go ahead and carry out your promises and vows to her!°Ø
24Jr 44:26 °∞But listen to this message from the Lord, all you Judeans now living in Egypt£∫ °ÆI have sworn by my great name,°Ø says the Lord, °Æthat my name will no longer be spoken by any of the Judeans in the land of Egypt. None of you may invoke my name or use this oath£∫ °∞As surely as the Sovereign Lord lives.°± 
24Jr 44:27 For I will watch over you to bring you disaster and not good. Everyone from Judah who is now living in Egypt will suffer war and famine until all of you are dead. 
24Jr 44:28 Only a small number will escape death and return to Judah from Egypt. Then all those who came to Egypt will find out whose words are true - mine or theirs!
24Jr 44:29 °∞°ÆAnd this is the proof I give you,°Ø says the Lord, °Æthat all I have threatened will happen to you and that I will punish you here.°Ø 
24Jr 44:30 This is what the Lord says£∫ °ÆI will turn Pharaoh Hophra, king of Egypt, over to his enemies who want to kill him, just as I turned King Zedekiah of Judah over to King Nebuchadnezzar®Á of Babylon.°Ø°± / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar.
24Jr 45:1 The prophet Jeremiah gave a message to Baruch son of Neriah in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah®Á, after Baruch had written down everything Jeremiah had dictated to him. He said, / ®ÁThe fourth year of Jehoiakim°Øs reign was 605 b.c.
24Jr 45:2 °∞This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says to you, Baruch£∫ 
24Jr 45:3 You have said, °ÆI am overwhelmed with trouble! Haven°Øt I had enough pain already? And now the Lord has added more! I am worn out from sighing and can find no rest.°Ø
24Jr 45:4 °∞Baruch, this is what the Lord says£∫ °ÆI will destroy this nation that I built. I will uproot what I planted. 
24Jr 45:5 Are you seeking great things for yourself? Don°Øt do it! I will bring great disaster upon all these people; but I will give you your life as a reward wherever you go. I, the Lord, have spoken!°Ø°±
24Jr 46:1 The following messages were given to Jeremiah the prophet from the Lord concerning foreign nations.
24Jr 46:2 This message concerning Egypt was given in the fourth year of the reign of Jehoiakim son of Josiah, the king of Judah, on the occasion of the battle of Carchemish®Á when Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, and his army were defeated beside the Euphrates River by King Nebuchadnezzar®Ë of Babylon. / ®ÁThis event occurred in 605 b.c., during the fourth year of Jehoiakim°Øs reign (according to the calendar system in which the new year begins in the spring). ®ËHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar; also in 46.13, 26.
24Jr 46:3 °∞Prepare your shields, and advance into battle!
24Jr 46:4 Harness the horses, and mount the stallions. Take your positions. Put on your helmets. Sharpen your spears, and prepare your armor.
24Jr 46:5 But what do I see? The Egyptian army flees in terror. The bravest of its fighting men run without a backward glance. They are terrorized at every turn,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 46:6 °∞The swiftest runners cannot flee; the mightiest warriors cannot escape. By the Euphrates River to the north, they stumble and fall.
24Jr 46:7 °∞Who is this, rising like the Nile at floodtime, overflowing all the land?
24Jr 46:8 It is the Egyptian army, overflowing all the land, boasting that it will cover the earth like a flood, destroying cities and their people.
24Jr 46:9 Charge, you horses and chariots; attack, you mighty warriors of Egypt! Come, all you allies from Ethiopia, Libya, and Lydia®Á who are skilled with the shield and bow! / ®ÁHebrew from Cush, Put, and Lud.
24Jr 46:10 For this is the day of the Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, a day of vengeance on his enemies. The sword will devour until it is satisfied, yes, until it is drunk with your blood! The Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, will receive a sacrifice today in the north country beside the Euphrates River.
24Jr 46:11 °∞Go up to Gilead to get medicine, O virgin daughter of Egypt! But your many treatments will bring you no healing.
24Jr 46:12 The nations have heard of your shame. The earth is filled with your cries of despair. Your mightiest warriors will run into each other and fall down together.°±
24Jr 46:13 Then the Lord gave the prophet Jeremiah this message about King Nebuchadnezzar°Øs plans to attack Egypt.
24Jr 46:14 °∞Shout it out in Egypt! Publish it in the cities of Migdol, Memphis®Á, and Tahpanhes! Mobilize for battle, for the sword will devour everyone around you. / ®ÁHebrew Noph; also in 46.19.
24Jr 46:15 Why have your warriors fallen? They cannot stand, for the Lord has knocked them down.
24Jr 46:16 They stumble and fall over each other and say among themselves, °ÆCome, let°Øs go back to our people, to the land of our birth. Let°Øs get away from the sword of the enemy!°Ø
24Jr 46:17 There they will say, °ÆPharaoh, the king of Egypt, is a loudmouth who missed his opportunity!°Ø
24Jr 46:18 °∞As surely as I live,°± says the King, whose name is the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, °∞one is coming against Egypt who is as tall as Mount Tabor, or as Mount Carmel by the sea!
24Jr 46:19 Pack up! Get ready to leave for exile, you citizens of Egypt! The city of Memphis will be destroyed, without a single inhabitant.
24Jr 46:20 Egypt is as sleek as a beautiful young cow, but a horsefly from the north is on its way!
24Jr 46:21 Egypt°Øs mercenaries have become like fattened calves. They, too, will turn and run, for it is a day of great disaster for Egypt, a time of great punishment.
24Jr 46:22 Egypt flees, silent as a serpent gliding away. The invading army marches in; they come against her with axes like woodsmen.
24Jr 46:23 They will cut down her people like trees,°± says the Lord, °∞for they are more numerous than locusts.
24Jr 46:24 Egypt will be humiliated; she will be handed over to people from the north.°±
24Jr 46:25 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says£∫ °∞I will punish Amon, the god of Thebes®Á, and all the other gods of Egypt. I will punish its rulers and Pharaoh, too, and all who trust in him. / ®ÁHebrew of No.
24Jr 46:26 I will hand them over to those who want them killed - to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his army. But afterward the land will recover from the ravages of war. I, the Lord, have spoken!
24Jr 46:27 °∞But do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant; do not be dismayed, Israel. For I will bring you home again from distant lands, and your children will return from their exile. Israel®Á will return to a life of peace and quiet, and no one will terrorize them. / ®ÁHebrew Jacob. See note on 5.20.
24Jr 46:28 Do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant, for I am with you,°± says the Lord. °∞I will completely destroy the nations to which I have exiled you, but I will not completely destroy you. I will discipline you, but with justice; I cannot let you go unpunished.°±
24Jr 47:1 This is the Lord°Øs message to the prophet Jeremiah concerning the Philistines of Gaza, before it was captured by the Egyptian army. 
24Jr 47:2 This is what the Lord says. °∞A flood is coming from the north to overflow the land. It will destroy the land and everything in it - cities and people alike. People will scream in terror, and everyone in the land will wail.
24Jr 47:3 Hear the clatter of stallions°Ø hooves and the rumble of wheels as the chariots rush by. Terrified fathers run madly, without a backward glance at their helpless children.
24Jr 47:4 °∞The time has come for the Philistines to be destroyed, along with their allies from Tyre and Sidon. Yes, the Lord is destroying the remnant of the Philistines, those colonists from the island of Crete®Á. / ®ÁHebrew from Caphtor.
24Jr 47:5 Gaza will be humiliated, its head shaved bald; Ashkelon will lie silent. You remnant from the Mediterranean coast®Á, how long will you lament and mourn? / ®ÁHebrew the plain.
24Jr 47:6 °∞Now, O sword of the Lord, when will you be at rest again? Go back into your sheath; rest and be still.
24Jr 47:7 °∞But how can it be still when the Lord has sent it on a mission? For the city of Ashkelon and the people living along the sea must be destroyed.°±
24Jr 48:1 This message was given concerning Moab. This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says. °∞What sorrow awaits the city of Nebo; it will soon lie in ruins. The city of Kiriathaim will be humiliated and captured; the fortress will be humiliated and broken down.
24Jr 48:2 No one will ever brag about Moab again, for in Heshbon there is a plot to destroy her. °ÆCome,°Ø they say, °Æwe will cut her off from being a nation.°Ø The town of Madmen®Á, too, will be silenced; the sword will follow you there. / ®ÁMadmen sounds like the Hebrew word for °∞silence°±; it should not be confused with the English word madmen.
24Jr 48:3 Listen to the cries from Horonaim, cries of devastation and great destruction.
24Jr 48:4 All Moab is destroyed. Her little ones will cry out®Á. / ®ÁGreek version reads Her cries are heard as far away as Zoar.
24Jr 48:5 Her refugees weep bitterly, climbing the slope to Luhith. They cry out in terror, descending the slope to Horonaim.
24Jr 48:6 Flee for your lives! Hide®Á in the wilderness! / ®ÁOr Hide like a wild donkey; or Hide like a juniper shrub; or Be like [the town of] Aroer. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
24Jr 48:7 Because you have trusted in your wealth and skill, you will be taken captive. Your god Chemosh, with his priests and officials, will be hauled off to distant lands!
24Jr 48:8 °∞All the towns will be destroyed, and no one will escape - either on the plateaus or in the valleys, for the Lord has spoken.
24Jr 48:9 Oh, that Moab had wings so she could fly away®Á, for her towns will be left empty, with no one living in them. / ®ÁOr Put salt on Moab, / for she will be laid waste.
24Jr 48:10 Cursed are those who refuse to do the Lord°Øs work, who hold back their swords from shedding blood!
24Jr 48:11 °∞From his earliest history, Moab has lived in peace, never going into exile. He is like wine that has been allowed to settle. He has not been poured from flask to flask, and he is now fragrant and smooth.
24Jr 48:12 But the time is coming soon,°± says the Lord, °∞when I will send men to pour him from his jar. They will pour him out, then shatter the jar!
24Jr 48:13 At last Moab will be ashamed of his idol Chemosh, as the people of Israel were ashamed of their gold calf at Bethel®Á. / ®ÁHebrew ashamed when they trusted in Bethel.
24Jr 48:14 °∞You used to boast, °ÆWe are heroes, mighty men of war.°Ø
24Jr 48:15 But now Moab and his towns will be destroyed. His most promising youth are doomed to slaughter,°± says the King, whose name is the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.
24Jr 48:16 °∞Destruction is coming fast for Moab; calamity threatens ominously.
24Jr 48:17 You friends of Moab, weep for him and cry! See how the strong scepter is broken, how the beautiful staff is shattered!
24Jr 48:18 °∞Come down from your glory and sit in the dust, you people of Dibon, for those who destroy Moab will shatter Dibon, too. They will tear down all your towers.
24Jr 48:19 You people of Aroer, stand beside the road and watch. Shout to those who flee from Moab, °ÆWhat has happened there?°Ø
24Jr 48:20 °∞And the reply comes back, °ÆMoab lies in ruins, disgraced; weep and wail! Tell it by the banks of the Arnon River. Moab has been destroyed!°Ø
24Jr 48:21 Judgment has been poured out on the towns of the plateau - on Holon and Jahaz®Á and Mephaath, / ®ÁHebrew Jahzah, a variant spelling of Jahaz.
24Jr 48:22 on Dibon and Nebo and Beth-diblathaim,
24Jr 48:23 on Kiriathaim and Beth-gamul and Beth-meon,
24Jr 48:24 on Kerioth and Bozrah - all the towns of Moab, far and near.
24Jr 48:25 °∞The strength of Moab has ended. His arm has been broken,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 48:26 °∞Let him stagger and fall like a drunkard, for he has rebelled against the Lord. Moab will wallow in his own vomit, ridiculed by all.
24Jr 48:27 Did you not ridicule the people of Israel? Were they caught in the company of thieves that you should despise them as you do?
24Jr 48:28 °∞You people of Moab, flee from your towns and live in the caves. Hide like doves that nest in the clefts of the rocks.
24Jr 48:29 We have all heard of the pride of Moab, for his pride is very great. We know of his lofty pride, his arrogance, and his haughty heart.
24Jr 48:30 I know about his insolence,°± says the Lord, °∞but his boasts are empty - as empty as his deeds.
24Jr 48:31 So now I wail for Moab; yes, I will mourn for Moab. My heart is broken for the men of Kir-hareseth®Á. / ®ÁHebrew Kir-heres, a variant spelling of Kir-hareseth; also in 48.36.
24Jr 48:32 °∞You people of Sibmah, rich in vineyards, I will weep for you even more than I did for Jazer. Your spreading vines once reached as far as the Dead Sea®Á, but the destroyer has stripped you bare! He has harvested your grapes and summer fruits. / ®ÁHebrew the sea of Jazer.
24Jr 48:33 Joy and gladness are gone from fruitful Moab. The presses yield no wine. No one treads the grapes with shouts of joy. There is shouting, yes, but not of joy.
24Jr 48:34 °∞Instead, their awful cries of terror can be heard from Heshbon clear across to Elealeh and Jahaz; from Zoar all the way to Horonaim and Eglath-shelishiyah. Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up now.
24Jr 48:35 °∞I will put an end to Moab,°± says the Lord, °∞for the people offer sacrifices at the pagan shrines and burn incense to their false gods. 
24Jr 48:36 My heart moans like a flute for Moab and Kir-hareseth, for all their wealth has disappeared. 
24Jr 48:37 The people shave their heads and beards in mourning. They slash their hands and put on clothes made of burlap. 
24Jr 48:38 There is crying and sorrow in every Moabite home and on every street. For I have smashed Moab like an old, unwanted jar. 
24Jr 48:39 How it is shattered! Hear the wailing! See the shame of Moab! It has become an object of ridicule, an example of ruin to all its neighbors.°±
24Jr 48:40 This is what the Lord says. °∞Look! The enemy swoops down like an eagle, spreading his wings over Moab.
24Jr 48:41 Its cities will fall, and its strongholds will be seized. Even the mightiest warriors will be in anguish like a woman in labor.
24Jr 48:42 Moab will no longer be a nation, for it has boasted against the Lord.
24Jr 48:43 °∞Terror and traps and snares will be your lot, O Moab,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 48:44 °∞Those who flee in terror will fall into a trap, and those who escape the trap will step into a snare. I will see to it that you do not get away, for the time of your judgment has come,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 48:45 °∞The people flee as far as Heshbon but are unable to go on. For a fire comes from Heshbon, King Sihon°Øs ancient home, to devour the entire land with all its rebellious people.
24Jr 48:46 °∞O Moab, they weep for you! The people of the god Chemosh are destroyed! Your sons and your daughters have been taken away as captives.
24Jr 48:47 But I will restore the fortunes of Moab in days to come. I, the Lord, have spoken!°± This is the end of Jeremiah°Øs prophecy concerning Moab.
24Jr 49:1 This message was given concerning the Ammonites. This is what the Lord says. °∞Are there no descendants of Israel to inherit the land of Gad? Why are you, who worship Molech®Á, living in its towns? / ®ÁHebrew Malcam, a variant spelling of Molech; also in 49.3.
24Jr 49:2 In the days to come,°± says the Lord, °∞I will sound the battle cry against your city of Rabbah. It will become a desolate heap of ruins, and the neighboring towns will be burned. Then Israel will take back the land you took from her,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 49:3 °∞Cry out, O Heshbon, for the town of Ai is destroyed. Weep, O people of Rabbah! Put on your clothes of mourning. Weep and wail, hiding in the hedges, for your god Molech, with his priests and officials, will be hauled off to distant lands.
24Jr 49:4 You are proud of your fertile valleys, but they will soon be ruined. You trusted in your wealth, you rebellious daughter, and thought no one could ever harm you.
24Jr 49:5 But look! I will bring terror upon you,°± says the Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. °∞Your neighbors will chase you from your land, and no one will help your exiles as they flee.
24Jr 49:6 But I will restore the fortunes of the Ammonites in days to come. I, the Lord, have spoken.°±
24Jr 49:7 This message was given concerning Edom. This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says. °∞Is there no wisdom in Teman? Is no one left to give wise counsel?
24Jr 49:8 Turn and flee! Hide in deep caves, you people of Dedan! For when I bring disaster on Edom®Á, I will punish you, too! / ®ÁHebrew Esau; also in 49.10.
24Jr 49:9 Those who harvest grapes always leave a few for the poor. If thieves came at night, they would not take everything.
24Jr 49:10 But I will strip bare the land of Edom, and there will be no place left to hide. Its children, its brothers, and its neighbors will all be destroyed, and Edom itself will be no more.
24Jr 49:11 But I will protect the orphans who remain among you. Your widows, too, can depend on me for help.°±
24Jr 49:12 And this is what the Lord says£∫ °∞If the innocent must suffer, how much more must you! You will not go unpunished! You must drink this cup of judgment! 
24Jr 49:13 For I have sworn by my own name,°± says the Lord, °∞that Bozrah will become an object of horror and a heap of ruins; it will be mocked and cursed. All its towns and villages will be desolate forever.°±
24Jr 49:14 I have heard a message from the Lord that an ambassador was sent to the nations to say, °∞Form a coalition against Edom, and prepare for battle!°±
24Jr 49:15 The Lord says to Edom, °∞I will cut you down to size among the nations. You will be despised by all.
24Jr 49:16 You have been deceived by the fear you inspire in others and by your own pride. You live in a rock fortress and control the mountain heights. But even if you make your nest among the peaks with the eagles, I will bring you crashing down,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 49:17 °∞Edom will be an object of horror. All who pass by will be appalled and will gasp at the destruction they see there.
24Jr 49:18 It will be like the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns,°± says the Lord. °∞No one will live there; no one will inhabit it.
24Jr 49:19 I will come like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan, leaping on the sheep in the pasture. I will chase Edom from its land, and I will appoint the leader of my choice. For who is like me, and who can challenge me? What ruler can oppose my will?°±
24Jr 49:20 Listen to the Lord°Øs plans against Edom and the people of Teman. Even the little children will be dragged off like sheep, and their homes will be destroyed.
24Jr 49:21 The earth will shake with the noise of Edom°Øs fall, and its cry of despair will be heard all the way to the Red Sea®Á. / ®ÁHebrew sea of reeds.
24Jr 49:22 Look! The enemy swoops down like an eagle, spreading his wings over Bozrah. Even the mightiest warriors will be in anguish like a woman in labor.
24Jr 49:23 This message was given concerning Damascus. This is what the Lord says. °∞The towns of Hamath and Arpad are struck with fear, for they have heard the news of their destruction. Their hearts are troubled like a wild sea in a raging storm.
24Jr 49:24 Damascus has become feeble, and all her people turn to flee. Fear, anguish, and pain have gripped her as they grip a woman in labor.
24Jr 49:25 That famous city, a city of joy, will be forsaken!
24Jr 49:26 Her young men will fall in the streets and die. Her soldiers will all be killed,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.
24Jr 49:27 °∞And I will set fire to the walls of Damascus that will burn up the palaces of Ben-hadad.°±
24Jr 49:28 This message was given concerning Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor, which were attacked by King Nebuchadnezzar®Á of Babylon. This is what the Lord says. °∞Advance against Kedar! Destroy the warriors from the East! / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar; also in 49.30.
24Jr 49:29 Their flocks and tents will be captured, and their household goods and camels will be taken away. Everywhere shouts of panic will be heard. °ÆWe are terrorized at every turn!°Ø
24Jr 49:30 Run for your lives,°± says the Lord. °∞Hide yourselves in deep caves, you people of Hazor, for King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has plotted against you and is preparing to destroy you.
24Jr 49:31 °∞Go up and attack that complacent nation,°± says the Lord. °∞Its people live alone in the desert without walls or gates.
24Jr 49:32 Their camels and other livestock will all be yours. I will scatter to the winds these people who live in remote places®Á. I will bring calamity upon them from every direction,°± says the Lord. / ®ÁOr who clip the corners of their hair.
24Jr 49:33 °∞Hazor will be inhabited by jackals, and it will be desolate forever. No one will live there; no one will inhabit it.°±
24Jr 49:34 This message concerning Elam came to the prophet Jeremiah from the Lord at the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah. 
24Jr 49:35 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says. °∞I will destroy the archers of Elam - the best of their forces.
24Jr 49:36 I will bring enemies from all directions, and I will scatter the people of Elam to the four winds. They will be exiled to countries around the world.
24Jr 49:37 I myself will go with Elam°Øs enemies to shatter it. In my fierce anger, I will bring great disaster upon the people of Elam,°± says the Lord. °∞Their enemies will chase them with the sword until I have destroyed them completely.
24Jr 49:38 I will set my throne in Elam,°± says the Lord, °∞and I will destroy its king and officials.
24Jr 49:39 But I will restore the fortunes of Elam in days to come. I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
24Jr 50:1 The Lord gave Jeremiah the prophet this message concerning Babylon and the land of the Babylonians®Á. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans; also in 50.8, 25, 35, 45.
24Jr 50:2 This is what the Lord says. °∞Tell the whole world, and keep nothing back. Raise a signal flag to tell everyone that Babylon will fall! Her images and idols®Á will be shattered. Her gods Bel and Marduk will be utterly disgraced. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung.
24Jr 50:3 For a nation will attack her from the north and bring such destruction that no one will live there again. Everything will be gone; both people and animals will flee.
24Jr 50:4 °∞In those coming days,°± says the Lord, °∞the people of Israel will return home together with the people of Judah. They will come weeping and seeking the Lord their God.
24Jr 50:5 They will ask the way to Jerusalem®Á and will start back home again. They will bind themselves to the Lord with an eternal covenant that will never be forgotten. / ®ÁHebrew Zion; also in 50.28.
24Jr 50:6 °∞My people have been lost sheep. Their shepherds have led them astray and turned them loose in the mountains. They have lost their way and can°Øt remember how to get back to the sheepfold.
24Jr 50:7 All who found them devoured them. Their enemies said, °ÆWe did nothing wrong in attacking them, for they sinned against the Lord, their true place of rest, and the hope of their ancestors.°Ø
24Jr 50:8 °∞But now, flee from Babylon! Leave the land of the Babylonians. Like male goats at the head of the flock, lead my people home again.
24Jr 50:9 For I am raising up an army of great nations from the north. They will join forces to attack Babylon, and she will be captured. The enemies°Ø arrows will go straight to the mark; they will not miss!
24Jr 50:10 Babylonia®Á will be looted until the attackers are glutted with loot. I, the Lord, have spoken! / ®ÁOr Chaldea.
24Jr 50:11 °∞You rejoice and are glad, you who plundered my chosen people. You frisk about like a calf in a meadow and neigh like a stallion.
24Jr 50:12 But your homeland®Á will be overwhelmed with shame and disgrace. You will become the least of nations - a wilderness, a dry and desolate land. / ®ÁHebrew your mother.
24Jr 50:13 Because of the Lord°Øs anger, Babylon will become a deserted wasteland. All who pass by will be horrified and will gasp at the destruction they see there.
24Jr 50:14 °∞Yes, prepare to attack Babylon, all you surrounding nations. Let your archers shoot at her; spare no arrows. For she has sinned against the Lord.
24Jr 50:15 Shout war cries against her from every side. Look! She surrenders! Her walls have fallen. It is the Lord°Øs vengeance, so take vengeance on her. Do to her as she has done to others!
24Jr 50:16 Take from Babylon all those who plant crops; send all the harvesters away. Because of the sword of the enemy, everyone will run away and rush back to their own lands.
24Jr 50:17 °∞The Israelites are like sheep that have been scattered by lions. First the king of Assyria ate them up. Then King Nebuchadnezzar®Á of Babylon cracked their bones.°± / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar.
24Jr 50:18 Therefore, this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says. °∞Now I will punish the king of Babylon and his land, just as I punished the king of Assyria.
24Jr 50:19 And I will bring Israel home again to its own land, to feed in the fields of Carmel and Bashan, and to be satisfied once more in the hill country of Ephraim and Gilead.
24Jr 50:20 In those days,°± says the Lord, °∞no sin will be found in Israel or in Judah, for I will forgive the remnant I preserve.
24Jr 50:21 °∞Go up, my warriors, against the land of Merathaim and against the people of Pekod. Pursue, kill, and completely destroy®Á them, as I have commanded you,°± says the Lord. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the Lord, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.
24Jr 50:22 °∞Let the battle cry be heard in the land, a shout of great destruction.
24Jr 50:23 Babylon, the mightiest hammer in all the earth, lies broken and shattered. Babylon is desolate among the nations!
24Jr 50:24 Listen, Babylon, for I have set a trap for you. You are caught, for you have fought against the Lord.
24Jr 50:25 The Lord has opened his armory and brought out weapons to vent his fury. The terror that falls upon the Babylonians will be the work of the Sovereign Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.
24Jr 50:26 Yes, come against her from distant lands. Break open her granaries. Crush her walls and houses into heaps of rubble. Destroy her completely, and leave nothing!
24Jr 50:27 Destroy even her young bulls - it will be terrible for them, too! Slaughter them all! For Babylon°Øs day of reckoning has come.
24Jr 50:28 Listen to the people who have escaped from Babylon, as they tell in Jerusalem how the Lord our God has taken vengeance against those who destroyed his Temple.
24Jr 50:29 °∞Send out a call for archers to come to Babylon. Surround the city so none can escape. Do to her as she has done to others, for she has defied the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.
24Jr 50:30 Her young men will fall in the streets and die. Her soldiers will all be killed,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 50:31 °∞See, I am your enemy, you arrogant people,°± says the Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. °∞Your day of reckoning has arrived - the day when I will punish you.
24Jr 50:32 O land of arrogance, you will stumble and fall, and no one will raise you up. For I will light a fire in the cities of Babylon that will burn up everything around them.°±
24Jr 50:33 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says. °∞The people of Israel and Judah have been wronged. Their captors hold them and refuse to let them go.
24Jr 50:34 But the one who redeems them is strong. His name is the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. He will defend them and give them rest again in Israel. But for the people of Babylon there will be no rest!
24Jr 50:35 °∞The sword of destruction will strike the Babylonians,°± says the Lord. °∞It will strike the people of Babylon - her officials and wise men, too.
24Jr 50:36 The sword will strike her wise counselors, and they will become fools. The sword will strike her mightiest warriors, and panic will seize them.
24Jr 50:37 The sword will strike her horses and chariots and her allies from other lands, and they will all become like women. The sword will strike her treasures, and they all will be plundered.
24Jr 50:38 The sword will even strike her water supply, causing it to dry up. And why? Because the whole land is filled with idols, and the people are madly in love with them.
24Jr 50:39 °∞Soon Babylon will be inhabited by desert animals and hyenas. It will be a home for owls. Never again will people live there; it will lie desolate forever.
24Jr 50:40 I will destroy it as I®Á destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighboring towns,°± says the Lord. °∞No one will live there; no one will inhabit it. / ®ÁHebrew as God.
24Jr 50:41 °∞Look! A great army is coming from the north. A great nation and many kings are rising against you from far-off lands.
24Jr 50:42 They are armed with bows and spears. They are cruel and show no mercy. As they ride forward on horses, they sound like a roaring sea. They are coming in battle formation, planning to destroy you, Babylon.
24Jr 50:43 The king of Babylon has heard reports about the enemy, and he is weak with fright. Pangs of anguish have gripped him, like those of a woman in labor.
24Jr 50:44 °∞I will come like a lion from the thickets of the Jordan, leaping on the sheep in the pasture. I will chase Babylon from its land, and I will appoint the leader of my choice. For who is like me, and who can challenge me? What ruler can oppose my will?°±
24Jr 50:45 Listen to the Lord°Øs plans against Babylon and the land of the Babylonians. Even the little children will be dragged off like sheep, and their homes will be destroyed.
24Jr 50:46 The earth will shake with the shout, °∞Babylon has been taken!°± and its cry of despair will be heard around the world.
24Jr 51:1 This is what the Lord says. °∞I will stir up a destroyer against Babylon and the people of Babylonia®Á. / ®ÁHebrew of Leb-kamai, a code name for Babylonia.
24Jr 51:2 Foreigners will come and winnow her, blowing her away as chaff. They will come from every side to rise against her in her day of trouble.
24Jr 51:3 Don°Øt let the archers put on their armor or draw their bows. Don°Øt spare even her best soldiers! Let her army be completely destroyed®Á. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the Lord, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.
24Jr 51:4 They will fall dead in the land of the Babylonians®Á, slashed to death in her streets. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans; also in 51.54.
24Jr 51:5 For the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has not abandoned Israel and Judah. He is still their God, even though their land was filled with sin against the Holy One of Israel.°±
24Jr 51:6 Flee from Babylon! Save yourselves! Don°Øt get trapped in her punishment! It is the Lord°Øs time for vengeance; he will repay her in full.
24Jr 51:7 Babylon has been a gold cup in the Lord°Øs hands, a cup that made the whole earth drunk. The nations drank Babylon°Øs wine, and it drove them all mad.
24Jr 51:8 But suddenly Babylon, too, has fallen. Weep for her. Give her medicine. Perhaps she can yet be healed.
24Jr 51:9 We would have helped her if we could, but nothing can save her now. Let her go; abandon her. Return now to your own land. For her punishment reaches to the heavens; it is so great it cannot be measured.
24Jr 51:10 The Lord has vindicated us. Come, let us announce in Jerusalem®Á everything the Lord our God has done. / ®ÁHebrew Zion; also in 51.24.
24Jr 51:11 Sharpen the arrows! Lift up the shields!®Á For the Lord has inspired the kings of the Medes to march against Babylon and destroy her. This is his vengeance against those who desecrated his Temple. / ®ÁGreek version reads Fill up the quivers.
24Jr 51:12 Raise the battle flag against Babylon! Reinforce the guard and station the watchmen. Prepare an ambush, for the Lord will fulfill all his plans against Babylon.
24Jr 51:13 You are a city by a great river, a great center of commerce, but your end has come. The thread of your life is cut.
24Jr 51:14 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has taken this vow and has sworn to it by his own name. °∞Your cities will be filled with enemies, like fields swarming with locusts, and they will shout in triumph over you.°±
24Jr 51:15 The Lord made the earth by his power, and he preserves it by his wisdom. With his own understanding he stretched out the heavens.
24Jr 51:16 When he speaks in the thunder, the heavens are filled with water. He causes the clouds to rise over the earth. He sends the lightning with the rain and releases the wind from his storehouses.
24Jr 51:17 The whole human race is foolish and has no knowledge! The craftsmen are disgraced by the idols they make, for their carefully shaped works are a fraud. These idols have no breath or power.
24Jr 51:18 Idols are worthless; they are ridiculous lies! On the day of reckoning they will all be destroyed.
24Jr 51:19 But the God of Israel®Á is no idol! He is the Creator of everything that exists, including his people, his own special possession. The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies is his name! / ®ÁHebrew the Portion of Jacob. See note on 5.20.
24Jr 51:20 °∞You®Á are my battle-ax and sword,°± says the Lord. °∞With you I will shatter nations and destroy many kingdoms. / ®ÁPossibly Cyrus, whom God used to conquer Babylon. Compare Isa 44.28; 45.1.
24Jr 51:21 With you I will shatter armies - destroying the horse and rider, the chariot and charioteer.
24Jr 51:22 With you I will shatter men and women, old people and children, young men and maidens.
24Jr 51:23 With you I will shatter shepherds and flocks, farmers and oxen, captains and officers.
24Jr 51:24 °∞I will repay Babylon and the people of Babylonia®Á for all the wrong they have done to my people in Jerusalem,°± says the Lord. / ®ÁOr Chaldea; also in 51.35.
24Jr 51:25 °∞Look, O mighty mountain, destroyer of the earth! I am your enemy,°± says the Lord. °∞I will raise my fist against you, to knock you down from the heights. When I am finished, you will be nothing but a heap of burnt rubble.
24Jr 51:26 You will be desolate forever. Even your stones will never again be used for building. You will be completely wiped out,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 51:27 Raise a signal flag to the nations. Sound the battle cry! Mobilize them all against Babylon. Prepare them to fight against her! Bring out the armies of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz. Appoint a commander, and bring a multitude of horses like swarming locusts!
24Jr 51:28 Bring against her the armies of the nations - led by the kings of the Medes and all their captains and officers.
24Jr 51:29 The earth trembles and writhes in pain, for everything the Lord has planned against Babylon stands unchanged. Babylon will be left desolate without a single inhabitant.
24Jr 51:30 Her mightiest warriors no longer fight. They stay in their barracks, their courage gone. They have become like women. The invaders have burned the houses and broken down the city gates.
24Jr 51:31 The news is passed from one runner to the next as the messengers hurry to tell the king that his city has been captured.
24Jr 51:32 All the escape routes are blocked. The marshes have been set aflame, and the army is in a panic.
24Jr 51:33 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, says. °∞Babylon is like wheat on a threshing floor, about to be trampled. In just a little while her harvest will begin.°±
24Jr 51:34 °∞King Nebuchadnezzar®Á of Babylon has eaten and crushed us and drained us of strength. He has swallowed us like a great monster and filled his belly with our riches. He has thrown us out of our own country. / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar.
24Jr 51:35 Make Babylon suffer as she made us suffer,°± say the people of Zion. °∞Make the people of Babylonia pay for spilling our blood,°± says Jerusalem.
24Jr 51:36 This is what the Lord says to Jerusalem£∫ °∞I will be your lawyer to plead your case, and I will avenge you. I will dry up her river, as well as her springs,
24Jr 51:37 and Babylon will become a heap of ruins, haunted by jackals. She will be an object of horror and contempt, a place where no one lives.
24Jr 51:38 Her people will roar together like strong lions. They will growl like lion cubs.
24Jr 51:39 And while they lie inflamed with all their wine, I will prepare a different kind of feast for them. I will make them drink until they fall asleep, and they will never wake up again,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 51:40 °∞I will bring them down like lambs to the slaughter, like rams and goats to be sacrificed.
24Jr 51:41 °∞How Babylon®Á is fallen - great Babylon, praised throughout the earth! Now she has become an object of horror among the nations. / ®ÁHebrew Sheshach, a code name for Babylon.
24Jr 51:42 The sea has risen over Babylon; she is covered by its crashing waves.
24Jr 51:43 Her cities now lie in ruins; she is a dry wasteland where no one lives or even passes by.
24Jr 51:44 And I will punish Bel, the god of Babylon, and make him vomit up all he has eaten. The nations will no longer come and worship him. The wall of Babylon has fallen!
24Jr 51:45 °∞Come out, my people, flee from Babylon. Save yourselves! Run from the Lord°Øs fierce anger.
24Jr 51:46 But do not panic; don°Øt be afraid when you hear the first rumor of approaching forces. For rumors will keep coming year by year. Violence will erupt in the land as the leaders fight against each other.
24Jr 51:47 For the time is surely coming when I will punish this great city and all her idols. Her whole land will be disgraced, and her dead will lie in the streets.
24Jr 51:48 Then the heavens and earth will rejoice, for out of the north will come destroying armies against Babylon,°± says the Lord.
24Jr 51:49 °∞Just as Babylon killed the people of Israel and others throughout the world, so must her people be killed.
24Jr 51:50 Get out, all you who have escaped the sword! Do not stand and watch - flee while you can! Remember the Lord, though you are in a far-off land, and think about your home in Jerusalem.°±
24Jr 51:51 °∞We are ashamed,°± the people say. °∞We are insulted and disgraced because the Lord°Øs Temple has been defiled by foreigners.°±
24Jr 51:52 °∞Yes,°± says the Lord, °∞but the time is coming when I will destroy Babylon°Øs idols. The groans of her wounded people will be heard throughout the land.
24Jr 51:53 Though Babylon reaches as high as the heavens and makes her fortifications incredibly strong, I will still send enemies to plunder her. I, the Lord, have spoken!
24Jr 51:54 °∞Listen! Hear the cry of Babylon, the sound of great destruction from the land of the Babylonians.
24Jr 51:55 For the Lord is destroying Babylon. He will silence her loud voice. Waves of enemies pound against her; the noise of battle rings through the city.
24Jr 51:56 Destroying armies come against Babylon. Her mighty men are captured, and their weapons break in their hands. For the Lord is a God who gives just punishment; he always repays in full.
24Jr 51:57 I will make her officials and wise men drunk, along with her captains, officers, and warriors. They will fall asleep and never wake up again!°± says the King, whose name is the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.
24Jr 51:58 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says. °∞The thick walls of Babylon will be leveled to the ground, and her massive gates will be burned. The builders from many lands have worked in vain, for their work will be destroyed by fire!°±
24Jr 51:59 The prophet Jeremiah gave this message to Seraiah son of Neriah and grandson of Mahseiah, a staff officer, when Seraiah went to Babylon with King Zedekiah of Judah. This was during the fourth year of Zedekiah°Øs reign®Á. / ®ÁThe fourth year of Zedekiah°Øs reign was 593 b.c.
24Jr 51:60 Jeremiah had recorded on a scroll all the terrible disasters that would soon come upon Babylon - all the words written here. 
24Jr 51:61 He said to Seraiah, °∞When you get to Babylon, read aloud everything on this scroll. 
24Jr 51:62 Then say, °ÆLord, you have said that you will destroy Babylon so that neither people nor animals will remain here. She will lie empty and abandoned forever.°Ø 
24Jr 51:63 When you have finished reading the scroll, tie it to a stone and throw it into the Euphrates River. 
24Jr 51:64 Then say, °ÆIn this same way Babylon and her people will sink, never again to rise, because of the disasters I will bring upon her.°Ø°± This is the end of Jeremiah°Øs messages.
24Jr 52:1 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah. 
24Jr 52:2 But Zedekiah did what was evil in the Lord°Øs sight, just as Jehoiakim had done. 
24Jr 52:3 These things happened because of the Lord°Øs anger against the people of Jerusalem and Judah, until he finally banished them from his presence and sent them into exile. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon. 
24Jr 52:4 So on January 15®Á, during the ninth year of Zedekiah°Øs reign, King Nebuchadnezzar®Ë of Babylon led his entire army against Jerusalem. They surrounded the city and built siege ramps against its walls. / ®ÁHebrew on the tenth day of the tenth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. A number of events in Jeremiah can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Babylonian records and related accurately to our modern calendar. This day was January 15, 588 b.c. ®ËHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar; also in 52.12, 28, 29, 30.
24Jr 52:5 Jerusalem was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah°Øs reign.
24Jr 52:6 By July 18 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah°Øs reign®Á, the famine in the city had become very severe, and the last of the food was entirely gone. / ®ÁHebrew By the ninth day of the fourth month [in the eleventh year of Zedekiah°Øs reign]. This day was July 18, 586 b.c.; also see note on 52.4a.
24Jr 52:7 Then a section of the city wall was broken down, and all the soldiers fled. Since the city was surrounded by the Babylonians®Á, they waited for nightfall. Then they slipped through the gate between the two walls behind the king°Øs garden and headed toward the Jordan Valley®Ë. / ®ÁOr the Chaldeans; similarly in 52.8, 17. ®ËHebrew the Arabah.
24Jr 52:8 But the Babylonian troops chased King Zedekiah and caught him on the plains of Jericho, for his men had all deserted him and scattered. 
24Jr 52:9 They took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath. There the king of Babylon pronounced judgment upon Zedekiah. 
24Jr 52:10 He made Zedekiah watch as they slaughtered his sons and all the other officials of Judah. 
24Jr 52:11 Then they gouged out Zedekiah°Øs eyes, bound him in bronze chains, and led him away to Babylon. Zedekiah remained there in prison until the day of his death.
24Jr 52:12 On August 17 of that year®Á, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar°Øs reign, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard and an official of the Babylonian king, arrived in Jerusalem. / ®ÁHebrew On the tenth day of the fifth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was August 17, 586 b.c.; also see note on 52.4a.
24Jr 52:13 He burned down the Temple of the Lord, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem. He destroyed all the important buildings®Á in the city. / ®ÁOr destroyed the houses of all the important people.
24Jr 52:14 Then he supervised the entire Babylonian®Á army as they tore down the walls of Jerusalem on every side. / ®ÁOr Chaldean.
24Jr 52:15 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, then took as exiles some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people who remained in the city, the defectors who had declared their allegiance to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen. 
24Jr 52:16 But Nebuzaradan allowed some of the poorest people to stay behind in Judah to care for the vineyards and fields.
24Jr 52:17 The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars in front of the Lord°Øs Temple, the bronze water carts, and the great bronze basin called the Sea, and they carried all the bronze away to Babylon. 
24Jr 52:18 They also took all the ash buckets, shovels, lamp snuffers, basins, dishes, and all the other bronze articles used for making sacrifices at the Temple. 
24Jr 52:19 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, also took the small bowls, incense burners, basins, pots, lampstands, dishes, bowls used for liquid offerings, and all the other articles made of pure gold or silver.
24Jr 52:20 The weight of the bronze from the two pillars, the Sea with the twelve bronze oxen beneath it, and the water carts was too great to be measured. These things had been made for the Lord°Øs Temple in the days of King Solomon. 
24Jr 52:21 Each of the pillars was 27 feet tall and 18 feet in circumference®Á. They were hollow, with walls 3 inches thick®Ë. / ®ÁHebrew 18 cubits [8.1 meters] tall and 12 cubits [5.4 meters] in circumference. ®ËHebrew 4 fingers thick [8 centimeters].
24Jr 52:22 The bronze capital on top of each pillar was 7 1/2 feet®Á high and was decorated with a network of bronze pomegranates all the way around. / ®ÁHebrew 5 cubits [2.3 meters].
24Jr 52:23 There were 96 pomegranates on the sides, and a total of 100 on the network around the top.
24Jr 52:24 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took with him as prisoners Seraiah the high priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three chief gatekeepers. 
24Jr 52:25 And from among the people still hiding in the city, he took an officer who had been in charge of the Judean army; seven of the king°Øs personal advisers; the army commander°Øs chief secretary, who was in charge of recruitment; and sixty other citizens. 
24Jr 52:26 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took them all to the king of Babylon at Riblah. 
24Jr 52:27 And there at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon had them all put to death. So the people of Judah were sent into exile from their land.
24Jr 52:28 The number of captives taken to Babylon in the seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar°Øs reign®Á was 3,023. / ®ÁThis exile in the seventh year of Nebuchadnezzar°Øs reign occurred in 597 b.c.
24Jr 52:29 Then in Nebuchadnezzar°Øs eighteenth year®Á he took 832 more. / ®ÁThis exile in the eighteenth year of Nebuchadnezzar°Øs reign occurred in 586 b.c.
24Jr 52:30 In Nebuchadnezzar°Øs twenty-third year®Á he sent Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, who took 745 more - a total of 4,600 captives in all. / ®ÁThis exile in the twenty-third year of Nebuchadnezzar°Øs reign occurred in 581 b.c.
24Jr 52:31 In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, Evil-merodach ascended to the Babylonian throne. He was kind to®Á Jehoiachin and released him from prison on March 31 of that year®Ë. / ®ÁHebrew He raised the head of. ®ËHebrew on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month, of the ancient lunar Hebrew calendar. This day was March 31, 561 b.c.; also see note on 52.4a.
24Jr 52:32 He spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and gave him a higher place than all the other exiled kings in Babylon. 
24Jr 52:33 He supplied Jehoiachin with new clothes to replace his prison garb and allowed him to dine in the king°Øs presence for the rest of his life. 
24Jr 52:34 So the Babylonian king gave him a regular food allowance as long as he lived. This continued until the day of his death.

25Lm 1:1 ®ÁJerusalem, once so full of people, is now deserted. She who was once great among the nations now sits alone like a widow. Once the queen of all the earth, she is now a slave. / ®ÁEach of the first four chapters of this book is an acrostic, laid out in the order of the Hebrew alphabet. The first word of each verse begins with a successive Hebrew letter. Chapters 1, 2, and 4 have one verse for each of the 22 Hebrew letters. Chapter 3 contains 22 stanzas of three verses each. Though chapter 5 has 22 verses, it is not an acrostic.
25Lm 1:2 She sobs through the night; tears stream down her cheeks. Among all her lovers, there is no one left to comfort her. All her friends have betrayed her and become her enemies.
25Lm 1:3 Judah has been led away into captivity, oppressed with cruel slavery. She lives among foreign nations and has no place of rest. Her enemies have chased her down, and she has nowhere to turn.
25Lm 1:4 The roads to Jerusalem®Á are in mourning, for crowds no longer come to celebrate the festivals. The city gates are silent, her priests groan, her young women are crying - how bitter is her fate! / ®ÁHebrew Zion; also in 1.17.
25Lm 1:5 Her oppressors have become her masters, and her enemies prosper, for the Lord has punished Jerusalem for her many sins. Her children have been captured and taken away to distant lands.
25Lm 1:6 All the majesty of beautiful Jerusalem®Á has been stripped away. Her princes are like starving deer searching for pasture. They are too weak to run from the pursuing enemy. / ®ÁHebrew of the daughter of Zion.
25Lm 1:7 In the midst of her sadness and wandering, Jerusalem remembers her ancient splendor. But now she has fallen to her enemy, and there is no one to help her. Her enemy struck her down and laughed as she fell.
25Lm 1:8 Jerusalem has sinned greatly, so she has been tossed away like a filthy rag. All who once honored her now despise her, for they have seen her stripped naked and humiliated. All she can do is groan and hide her face.
25Lm 1:9 She defiled herself with immorality and gave no thought to her future. Now she lies in the gutter with no one to lift her out. °∞Lord, see my misery,°± she cries. °∞The enemy has triumphed.°±
25Lm 1:10 The enemy has plundered her completely, taking every precious thing she owns. She has seen foreigners violate her sacred Temple, the place the Lord had forbidden them to enter.
25Lm 1:11 Her people groan as they search for bread. They have sold their treasures for food to stay alive. °∞O Lord, look,°± she mourns, °∞and see how I am despised.
25Lm 1:12 °∞Does it mean nothing to you, all you who pass by? Look around and see if there is any suffering like mine, which the Lord brought on me when he erupted in fierce anger.
25Lm 1:13 °∞He has sent fire from heaven that burns in my bones. He has placed a trap in my path and turned me back. He has left me devastated, racked with sickness all day long.
25Lm 1:14 °∞He wove my sins into ropes to hitch me to a yoke of captivity. The Lord sapped my strength and turned me over to my enemies; I am helpless in their hands.
25Lm 1:15 °∞The Lord has treated my mighty men with contempt. At his command a great army has come to crush my young warriors. The Lord has trampled his beloved city®Á like grapes are trampled in a winepress. / ®ÁHebrew the virgin daughter of Judah.
25Lm 1:16 °∞For all these things I weep; tears flow down my cheeks. No one is here to comfort me; any who might encourage me are far away. My children have no future, for the enemy has conquered us.°±
25Lm 1:17 Jerusalem reaches out for help, but no one comforts her. Regarding his people Israel®Á, the Lord has said, °∞Let their neighbors be their enemies! Let them be thrown away like a filthy rag!°± / ®ÁHebrew Jacob. The names °∞Jacob°± and °∞Israel°± are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation.
25Lm 1:18 °∞The Lord is right,°± Jerusalem says, °∞for I rebelled against him. Listen, people everywhere; look upon my anguish and despair, for my sons and daughters have been taken captive to distant lands.
25Lm 1:19 °∞I begged my allies for help, but they betrayed me. My priests and leaders starved to death in the city, even as they searched for food to save their lives.
25Lm 1:20 °∞Lord, see my anguish! My heart is broken and my soul despairs, for I have rebelled against you. In the streets the sword kills, and at home there is only death.
25Lm 1:21 °∞Others heard my groans, but no one turned to comfort me. When my enemies heard about my troubles, they were happy to see what you had done. Oh, bring the day you promised, when they will suffer as I have suffered.
25Lm 1:22 °∞Look at all their evil deeds, Lord. Punish them, as you have punished me for all my sins. My groans are many, and I am sick at heart.°±
25Lm 2:1 The Lord in his anger has cast a dark shadow over beautiful Jerusalem®Á. The fairest of Israel°Øs cities lies in the dust, thrown down from the heights of heaven. In his day of great anger, the Lord has shown no mercy even to his Temple®Ë. / ®ÁHebrew the daughter of Zion; also in 2.8, 10, 18. ®ËHebrew his footstool.
25Lm 2:2 Without mercy the Lord has destroyed every home in Israel®Á. In his anger he has broken down the fortress walls of beautiful Jerusalem®Ë. He has brought them to the ground, dishonoring the kingdom and its rulers. / ®ÁHebrew Jacob; also in 2.3b. See note on 1.17. ®ËHebrew the daughter of Judah; also in 2.5.
25Lm 2:3 All the strength of Israel vanishes beneath his fierce anger. The Lord has withdrawn his protection as the enemy attacks. He consumes the whole land of Israel like a raging fire.
25Lm 2:4 He bends his bow against his people, as though he were their enemy. His strength is used against them to kill their finest youth. His fury is poured out like fire on beautiful Jerusalem®Á. / ®ÁHebrew on the tent of the daughter of Zion.
25Lm 2:5 Yes, the Lord has vanquished Israel like an enemy. He has destroyed her palaces and demolished her fortresses. He has brought unending sorrow and tears upon beautiful Jerusalem.
25Lm 2:6 He has broken down his Temple as though it were merely a garden shelter. The Lord has blotted out all memory of the holy festivals and Sabbath days. Kings and priests fall together before his fierce anger.
25Lm 2:7 The Lord has rejected his own altar; he despises his own sanctuary. He has given Jerusalem°Øs palaces to her enemies. They shout in the Lord°Øs Temple as though it were a day of celebration.
25Lm 2:8 The Lord was determined to destroy the walls of beautiful Jerusalem. He made careful plans for their destruction, then did what he had planned. Therefore, the ramparts and walls have fallen down before him.
25Lm 2:9 Jerusalem°Øs gates have sunk into the ground. He has smashed their locks and bars. Her kings and princes have been exiled to distant lands; her law has ceased to exist. Her prophets receive no more visions from the Lord.
25Lm 2:10 The leaders of beautiful Jerusalem sit on the ground in silence. They are clothed in burlap and throw dust on their heads. The young women of Jerusalem hang their heads in shame.
25Lm 2:11 I have cried until the tears no longer come; my heart is broken. My spirit is poured out in agony as I see the desperate plight of my people. Little children and tiny babies are fainting and dying in the streets.
25Lm 2:12 They cry out to their mothers, °∞We need food and drink!°± Their lives ebb away in the streets like the life of a warrior wounded in battle. They gasp for life as they collapse in their mothers°Ø arms.
25Lm 2:13 What can I say about you? Who has ever seen such sorrow? O daughter of Jerusalem, to what can I compare your anguish? O virgin daughter of Zion, how can I comfort you? For your wound is as deep as the sea. Who can heal you?
25Lm 2:14 Your prophets have said so many foolish things, false to the core. They did not save you from exile by pointing out your sins. Instead, they painted false pictures, filling you with false hope.
25Lm 2:15 All who pass by jeer at you. They scoff and insult beautiful Jerusalem®Á, saying, °∞Is this the city called °ÆMost Beautiful in All the World°Ø and °ÆJoy of All the Earth°Ø?°± / ®ÁHebrew the daughter of Jerusalem.
25Lm 2:16 All your enemies mock you. They scoff and snarl and say, °∞We have destroyed her at last! We have long waited for this day, and it is finally here!°±
25Lm 2:17 But it is the Lord who did just as he planned. He has fulfilled the promises of disaster he made long ago. He has destroyed Jerusalem without mercy. He has caused her enemies to gloat over her and has given them power over her.
25Lm 2:18 Cry aloud®Á before the Lord, O walls of beautiful Jerusalem! Let your tears flow like a river day and night. Give yourselves no rest; give your eyes no relief. / ®ÁHebrew Their heart cried.
25Lm 2:19 Rise during the night and cry out. Pour out your hearts like water to the Lord. Lift up your hands to him in prayer, pleading for your children, for in every street they are faint with hunger.
25Lm 2:20 °∞O Lord, think about this! Should you treat your own people this way? Should mothers eat their own children, those they once bounced on their knees? Should priests and prophets be killed within the Lord°Øs Temple?
25Lm 2:21 °∞See them lying in the streets - young and old, boys and girls, killed by the swords of the enemy. You have killed them in your anger, slaughtering them without mercy.
25Lm 2:22 °∞You have invited terrors from all around, as though you were calling them to a day of feasting. In the day of the Lord°Øs anger, no one has escaped or survived. The enemy has killed all the children whom I carried and raised.°±
25Lm 3:1 I am the one who has seen the afflictions that come from the rod of the Lord°Øs anger.
25Lm 3:2 He has led me into darkness, shutting out all light.
25Lm 3:3 He has turned his hand against me again and again, all day long.
25Lm 3:4 He has made my skin and flesh grow old. He has broken my bones.
25Lm 3:5 He has besieged and surrounded me with anguish and distress.
25Lm 3:6 He has buried me in a dark place, like those long dead.
25Lm 3:7 He has walled me in, and I cannot escape. He has bound me in heavy chains.
25Lm 3:8 And though I cry and shout, he has shut out my prayers.
25Lm 3:9 He has blocked my way with a high stone wall; he has made my road crooked.
25Lm 3:10 He has hidden like a bear or a lion, waiting to attack me.
25Lm 3:11 He has dragged me off the path and torn me in pieces, leaving me helpless and devastated.
25Lm 3:12 He has drawn his bow and made me the target for his arrows.
25Lm 3:13 He shot his arrows deep into my heart.
25Lm 3:14 My own people laugh at me. All day long they sing their mocking songs.
25Lm 3:15 He has filled me with bitterness and given me a bitter cup of sorrow to drink.
25Lm 3:16 He has made me chew on gravel. He has rolled me in the dust.
25Lm 3:17 Peace has been stripped away, and I have forgotten what prosperity is.
25Lm 3:18 I cry out, °∞My splendor is gone! Everything I had hoped for from the Lord is lost!°±
25Lm 3:19 The thought of my suffering and homelessness is bitter beyond words®Á. / ®ÁOr is wormwood and gall.
25Lm 3:20 I will never forget this awful time, as I grieve over my loss.
25Lm 3:21 Yet I still dare to hope when I remember this.
25Lm 3:22 The faithful love of the Lord never ends!®Á His mercies never cease. / ®ÁAs in Syriac version; Hebrew reads of the Lord keeps us from destruction.
25Lm 3:23 Great is his faithfulness; his mercies begin afresh each morning.
25Lm 3:24 I say to myself, °∞The Lord is my inheritance; therefore, I will hope in him!°±
25Lm 3:25 The Lord is good to those who depend on him, to those who search for him.
25Lm 3:26 So it is good to wait quietly for salvation from the Lord.
25Lm 3:27 And it is good for people to submit at an early age to the yoke of his discipline.
25Lm 3:28 Let them sit alone in silence beneath the Lord°Øs demands.
25Lm 3:29 Let them lie face down in the dust, for there may be hope at last.
25Lm 3:30 Let them turn the other cheek to those who strike them and accept the insults of their enemies.
25Lm 3:31 For no one is abandoned by the Lord forever.
25Lm 3:32 Though he brings grief, he also shows compassion because of the greatness of his unfailing love.
25Lm 3:33 For he does not enjoy hurting people or causing them sorrow.
25Lm 3:34 If people crush underfoot all the prisoners of the land,
25Lm 3:35 if they deprive others of their rights in defiance of the Most High,
25Lm 3:36 if they twist justice in the courts - doesn°Øt the Lord see all these things?
25Lm 3:37 Who can command things to happen without the Lord°Øs permission?
25Lm 3:38 Does not the Most High send both calamity and good?
25Lm 3:39 Then why should we, mere humans, complain when we are punished for our sins?
25Lm 3:40 Instead, let us test and examine our ways. Let us turn back to the Lord.
25Lm 3:41 Let us lift our hearts and hands to God in heaven and say,
25Lm 3:42 °∞We have sinned and rebelled, and you have not forgiven us.
25Lm 3:43 °∞You have engulfed us with your anger, chased us down, and slaughtered us without mercy.
25Lm 3:44 You have hidden yourself in a cloud so our prayers cannot reach you.
25Lm 3:45 You have discarded us as refuse and garbage among the nations.
25Lm 3:46 °∞All our enemies have spoken out against us.
25Lm 3:47 We are filled with fear, for we are trapped, devastated, and ruined.°±
25Lm 3:48 Tears stream from my eyes because of the destruction of my people!
25Lm 3:49 My tears flow endlessly; they will not stop
25Lm 3:50 until the Lord looks down from heaven and sees.
25Lm 3:51 My heart is breaking over the fate of all the women of Jerusalem.
25Lm 3:52 My enemies, whom I have never harmed, hunted me down like a bird.
25Lm 3:53 They threw me into a pit and dropped stones on me.
25Lm 3:54 The water rose over my head, and I cried out, °∞This is the end!°±
25Lm 3:55 But I called on your name, Lord, from deep within the pit.
25Lm 3:56 You heard me when I cried, °∞Listen to my pleading! Hear my cry for help!°±
25Lm 3:57 Yes, you came when I called; you told me, °∞Do not fear.°±
25Lm 3:58 Lord, you are my lawyer! Plead my case! For you have redeemed my life.
25Lm 3:59 You have seen the wrong they have done to me, Lord. Be my judge, and prove me right.
25Lm 3:60 You have seen the vengeful plots my enemies have laid against me.
25Lm 3:61 Lord, you have heard the vile names they call me. You know all about the plans they have made.
25Lm 3:62 My enemies whisper and mutter as they plot against me all day long.
25Lm 3:63 Look at them! Whether they sit or stand, I am the object of their mocking songs.
25Lm 3:64 Pay them back, Lord, for all the evil they have done.
25Lm 3:65 Give them hard and stubborn hearts, and then let your curse fall on them!
25Lm 3:66 Chase them down in your anger, destroying them beneath the Lord°Øs heavens.
25Lm 4:1 How the gold has lost its luster! Even the finest gold has become dull. The sacred gemstones lie scattered in the streets!
25Lm 4:2 See how the precious children of Jerusalem®Á, worth their weight in fine gold, are now treated like pots of clay made by a common potter. / ®ÁHebrew precious sons of Zion.
25Lm 4:3 Even the jackals feed their young, but not my people Israel. They ignore their children°Øs cries, like ostriches in the desert.
25Lm 4:4 The parched tongues of their little ones stick to the roofs of their mouths in thirst. The children cry for bread, but no one has any to give them.
25Lm 4:5 The people who once ate the richest foods now beg in the streets for anything they can get. Those who once wore the finest clothes now search the garbage dumps for food.
25Lm 4:6 The guilt®Á of my people is greater than that of Sodom, where utter disaster struck in a moment and no hand offered help. / ®ÁOr punishment.
25Lm 4:7 Our princes once glowed with health - brighter than snow, whiter than milk. Their faces were as ruddy as rubies, their appearance like fine jewels®Á. / ®ÁHebrew like lapis lazuli.
25Lm 4:8 But now their faces are blacker than soot. No one recognizes them in the streets. Their skin sticks to their bones; it is as dry and hard as wood.
25Lm 4:9 Those killed by the sword are better off than those who die of hunger. Starving, they waste away for lack of food from the fields.
25Lm 4:10 Tenderhearted women have cooked their own children. They have eaten them to survive the siege.
25Lm 4:11 But now the anger of the Lord is satisfied. His fierce anger has been poured out. He started a fire in Jerusalem®Á that burned the city to its foundations. / ®ÁHebrew in Zion.
25Lm 4:12 Not a king in all the earth - no one in all the world - would have believed that an enemy could march through the gates of Jerusalem.
25Lm 4:13 Yet it happened because of the sins of her prophets and the sins of her priests, who defiled the city by shedding innocent blood.
25Lm 4:14 They wandered blindly through the streets, so defiled by blood that no one dared touch them.
25Lm 4:15 °∞Get away!°± the people shouted at them. °∞You°Øre defiled! Don°Øt touch us!°± So they fled to distant lands and wandered among foreign nations, but none would let them stay.
25Lm 4:16 The Lord himself has scattered them, and he no longer helps them. People show no respect for the priests and no longer honor the leaders.
25Lm 4:17 We looked in vain for our allies to come and save us, but we were looking to nations that could not help us.
25Lm 4:18 We couldn°Øt go into the streets without danger to our lives. Our end was near; our days were numbered. We were doomed!
25Lm 4:19 Our enemies were swifter than eagles in flight. If we fled to the mountains, they found us. If we hid in the wilderness, they were waiting for us there.
25Lm 4:20 Our king - the Lord°Øs anointed, the very life of our nation - was caught in their snares. We had thought that his shadow would protect us against any nation on earth!
25Lm 4:21 Are you rejoicing in the land of Uz, O people of Edom? But you, too, must drink from the cup of the Lord°Øs anger. You, too, will be stripped naked in your drunkenness.
25Lm 4:22 O beautiful Jerusalem®Á, your punishment will end; you will soon return from exile. But Edom, your punishment is just beginning; soon your many sins will be exposed. / ®ÁHebrew O daughter of Zion.
25Lm 5:1 Lord, remember what has happened to us. See how we have been disgraced!
25Lm 5:2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, our homes to foreigners.
25Lm 5:3 We are orphaned and fatherless. Our mothers are widowed.
25Lm 5:4 We have to pay for water to drink, and even firewood is expensive.
25Lm 5:5 Those who pursue us are at our heels; we are exhausted but are given no rest.
25Lm 5:6 We submitted to Egypt and Assyria to get enough food to survive.
25Lm 5:7 Our ancestors sinned, but they have died - and we are suffering the punishment they deserved!
25Lm 5:8 Slaves have now become our masters; there is no one left to rescue us.
25Lm 5:9 We hunt for food at the risk of our lives, for violence rules the countryside.
25Lm 5:10 The famine has blackened our skin as though baked in an oven.
25Lm 5:11 Our enemies rape the women in Jerusalem®Á and the young girls in all the towns of Judah. / ®ÁHebrew in Zion.
25Lm 5:12 Our princes are being hanged by their thumbs, and our elders are treated with contempt.
25Lm 5:13 Young men are led away to work at millstones, and boys stagger under heavy loads of wood.
25Lm 5:14 The elders no longer sit in the city gates; the young men no longer dance and sing.
25Lm 5:15 Joy has left our hearts; our dancing has turned to mourning.
25Lm 5:16 The garlands have®Á fallen from our heads. Weep for us because we have sinned. / ®ÁOr The crown has.
25Lm 5:17 Our hearts are sick and weary, and our eyes grow dim with tears.
25Lm 5:18 For Jerusalem®Á is empty and desolate, a place haunted by jackals. / ®ÁHebrew Mount Zion.
25Lm 5:19 But Lord, you remain the same forever! Your throne continues from generation to generation.
25Lm 5:20 Why do you continue to forget us? Why have you abandoned us for so long?
25Lm 5:21 Restore us, O Lord, and bring us back to you again! Give us back the joys we once had!
25Lm 5:22 Or have you utterly rejected us? Are you angry with us still?

26Ezk 1:1 On July 31®Á of my thirtieth year®Ë, while I was with the Judean exiles beside the Kebar River in Babylon, the heavens were opened and I saw visions of God. / ®ÁHebrew On the fifth day of the fourth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. A number of dates in Ezekiel can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Babylonian records and related accurately to our modern calendar. This event occurred on July 31, 593 b.c. ®ËOr in the thirtieth year.
26Ezk 1:2 This happened during the fifth year of King Jehoiachin°Øs captivity. 
26Ezk 1:3 (The Lord gave this message to Ezekiel son of Buzi, a priest, beside the Kebar River in the land of the Babylonians®Á, and he felt the hand of the Lord take hold of him.) / ®ÁOr Chaldeans.
26Ezk 1:4 As I looked, I saw a great storm coming from the north, driving before it a huge cloud that flashed with lightning and shone with brilliant light. There was fire inside the cloud, and in the middle of the fire glowed something like gleaming amber®Á. / ®ÁOr like burnished metal; also in 1.27.
26Ezk 1:5 From the center of the cloud came four living beings that looked human, 
26Ezk 1:6 except that each had four faces and four wings. 
26Ezk 1:7 Their legs were straight, and their feet had hooves like those of a calf and shone like burnished bronze. 
26Ezk 1:8 Under each of their four wings I could see human hands. So each of the four beings had four faces and four wings. 
26Ezk 1:9 The wings of each living being touched the wings of the beings beside it. Each one moved straight forward in any direction without turning around.
26Ezk 1:10 Each had a human face in the front, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left side, and the face of an eagle at the back. 
26Ezk 1:11 Each had two pairs of outstretched wings - one pair stretched out to touch the wings of the living beings on either side of it, and the other pair covered its body. 
26Ezk 1:12 They went in whatever direction the spirit chose, and they moved straight forward in any direction without turning around.
26Ezk 1:13 The living beings looked like bright coals of fire or brilliant torches, and lightning seemed to flash back and forth among them. 
26Ezk 1:14 And the living beings darted to and fro like flashes of lightning.
26Ezk 1:15 As I looked at these beings, I saw four wheels touching the ground beside them, one wheel belonging to each. 
26Ezk 1:16 The wheels sparkled as if made of beryl. All four wheels looked alike and were made the same; each wheel had a second wheel turning crosswise within it. 
26Ezk 1:17 The beings could move in any of the four directions they faced, without turning as they moved. 
26Ezk 1:18 The rims of the four wheels were tall and frightening, and they were covered with eyes all around.
26Ezk 1:19 When the living beings moved, the wheels moved with them. When they flew upward, the wheels went up, too. 
26Ezk 1:20 The spirit of the living beings was in the wheels. So wherever the spirit went, the wheels and the living beings also went. 
26Ezk 1:21 When the beings moved, the wheels moved. When the beings stopped, the wheels stopped. When the beings flew upward, the wheels rose up, for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.
26Ezk 1:22 Spread out above them was a surface like the sky, glittering like crystal. 
26Ezk 1:23 Beneath this surface the wings of each living being stretched out to touch the others°Ø wings, and each had two wings covering its body. 
26Ezk 1:24 As they flew, their wings sounded to me like waves crashing against the shore or like the voice of the Almighty®Á or like the shouting of a mighty army. When they stopped, they let down their wings. / ®ÁHebrew Shaddai.
26Ezk 1:25 As they stood with wings lowered, a voice spoke from beyond the crystal surface above them.
26Ezk 1:26 Above this surface was something that looked like a throne made of blue lapis lazuli. And on this throne high above was a figure whose appearance resembled a man. 
26Ezk 1:27 From what appeared to be his waist up, he looked like gleaming amber, flickering like a fire. And from his waist down, he looked like a burning flame, shining with splendor. 
26Ezk 1:28 All around him was a glowing halo, like a rainbow shining in the clouds on a rainy day. This is what the glory of the Lord looked like to me. When I saw it, I fell face down on the ground, and I heard someone°Øs voice speaking to me.
26Ezk 2:1 °∞Stand up, son of man,°± said the voice. °∞I want to speak with you.°± 
26Ezk 2:2 The Spirit came into me as he spoke, and he set me on my feet. I listened carefully to his words. 
26Ezk 2:3 °∞Son of man,°± he said, °∞I am sending you to the nation of Israel, a rebellious nation that has rebelled against me. They and their ancestors have been rebelling against me to this very day. 
26Ezk 2:4 They are a stubborn and hard-hearted people. But I am sending you to say to them, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says!°Ø 
26Ezk 2:5 And whether they listen or refuse to listen - for remember, they are rebels - at least they will know they have had a prophet among them.
26Ezk 2:6 °∞Son of man, do not fear them or their words. Don°Øt be afraid even though their threats surround you like nettles and briers and stinging scorpions. Do not be dismayed by their dark scowls, even though they are rebels. 
26Ezk 2:7 You must give them my messages whether they listen or not. But they won°Øt listen, for they are completely rebellious! 
26Ezk 2:8 Son of man, listen to what I say to you. Do not join them in their rebellion. Open your mouth, and eat what I give you.°±
26Ezk 2:9 Then I looked and saw a hand reaching out to me. It held a scroll, 
26Ezk 2:10 which he unrolled. And I saw that both sides were covered with funeral songs, words of sorrow, and pronouncements of doom.
26Ezk 3:1 The voice said to me, °∞Son of man, eat what I am giving you - eat this scroll! Then go and give its message to the people of Israel.°± 
26Ezk 3:2 So I opened my mouth, and he fed me the scroll. 
26Ezk 3:3 °∞Fill your stomach with this,°± he said. And when I ate it, it tasted as sweet as honey in my mouth.
26Ezk 3:4 Then he said, °∞Son of man, go to the people of Israel and give them my messages. 
26Ezk 3:5 I am not sending you to a foreign people whose language you cannot understand. 
26Ezk 3:6 No, I am not sending you to people with strange and difficult speech. If I did, they would listen! 
26Ezk 3:7 But the people of Israel won°Øt listen to you any more than they listen to me! For the whole lot of them are hard-hearted and stubborn. 
26Ezk 3:8 But look, I have made you as obstinate and hard-hearted as they are. 
26Ezk 3:9 I have made your forehead as hard as the hardest rock! So don°Øt be afraid of them or fear their angry looks, even though they are rebels.°±
26Ezk 3:10 Then he added, °∞Son of man, let all my words sink deep into your own heart first. Listen to them carefully for yourself. 
26Ezk 3:11 Then go to your people in exile and say to them, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says!°Ø Do this whether they listen to you or not.°±
26Ezk 3:12 Then the Spirit lifted me up, and I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me. (May the glory of the Lord be praised in his place!)®Á / ®ÁA possible reading for this verse is Then the Spirit lifted me up, and as the glory of the Lord rose from its place, I heard a loud rumbling sound behind me.
26Ezk 3:13 It was the sound of the wings of the living beings as they brushed against each other and the rumbling of their wheels beneath them.
26Ezk 3:14 The Spirit lifted me up and took me away. I went in bitterness and turmoil, but the Lord°Øs hold on me was strong. 
26Ezk 3:15 Then I came to the colony of Judean exiles in Tel-abib, beside the Kebar River. I was overwhelmed and sat among them for seven days.
26Ezk 3:16 After seven days the Lord gave me a message. He said, 
26Ezk 3:17 °∞Son of man, I have appointed you as a watchman for Israel. Whenever you receive a message from me, warn people immediately. 
26Ezk 3:18 If I warn the wicked, saying, °ÆYou are under the penalty of death,°Ø but you fail to deliver the warning, they will die in their sins. And I will hold you responsible for their deaths. 
26Ezk 3:19 If you warn them and they refuse to repent and keep on sinning, they will die in their sins. But you will have saved yourself because you obeyed me.
26Ezk 3:20 °∞If righteous people turn away from their righteous behavior and ignore the obstacles I put in their way, they will die. And if you do not warn them, they will die in their sins. None of their righteous acts will be remembered, and I will hold you responsible for their deaths. 
26Ezk 3:21 But if you warn righteous people not to sin and they listen to you and do not sin, they will live, and you will have saved yourself, too.°±
26Ezk 3:22 Then the Lord took hold of me and said, °∞Get up and go out into the valley, and I will speak to you there.°± 
26Ezk 3:23 So I got up and went, and there I saw the glory of the Lord, just as I had seen in my first vision by the Kebar River. And I fell face down on the ground.
26Ezk 3:24 Then the Spirit came into me and set me on my feet. He spoke to me and said, °∞Go to your house and shut yourself in. 
26Ezk 3:25 There, son of man, you will be tied with ropes so you cannot go out among the people. 
26Ezk 3:26 And I will make your tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you will be speechless and unable to rebuke them, for they are rebels. 
26Ezk 3:27 But when I give you a message, I will loosen your tongue and let you speak. Then you will say to them, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says!°Ø Those who choose to listen will listen, but those who refuse will refuse, for they are rebels.
26Ezk 4:1 °∞And now, son of man, take a large clay brick and set it down in front of you. Then draw a map of the city of Jerusalem on it. 
26Ezk 4:2 Show the city under siege. Build a wall around it so no one can escape. Set up the enemy camp, and surround the city with siege ramps and battering rams. 
26Ezk 4:3 Then take an iron griddle and place it between you and the city. Turn toward the city and demonstrate how harsh the siege will be against Jerusalem. This will be a warning to the people of Israel.
26Ezk 4:4 °∞Now lie on your left side and place the sins of Israel on yourself. You are to bear their sins for the number of days you lie there on your side. 
26Ezk 4:5 I am requiring you to bear Israel°Øs sins for 390 days - one day for each year of their sin. 
26Ezk 4:6 After that, turn over and lie on your right side for 40 days - one day for each year of Judah°Øs sin.
26Ezk 4:7 °∞Meanwhile, keep staring at the siege of Jerusalem. Lie there with your arm bared and prophesy her destruction. 
26Ezk 4:8 I will tie you up with ropes so you won°Øt be able to turn from side to side until the days of your siege have been completed.
26Ezk 4:9 °∞Now go and get some wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and emmer wheat, and mix them together in a storage jar. Use them to make bread for yourself during the 390 days you will be lying on your side. 
26Ezk 4:10 Ration this out to yourself, eight ounces®Á of food for each day, and eat it at set times. / ®ÁHebrew 20 shekels [228 grams].
26Ezk 4:11 Then measure out a jar®Á of water for each day, and drink it at set times. / ®ÁHebrew 1/6 of a hin [about 1 pint or 0.6 liters].
26Ezk 4:12 Prepare and eat this food as you would barley cakes. While all the people are watching, bake it over a fire using dried human dung as fuel and then eat the bread.°± 
26Ezk 4:13 Then the Lord said, °∞This is how Israel will eat defiled bread in the Gentile lands to which I will banish them!°±
26Ezk 4:14 Then I said, °∞O Sovereign Lord, must I be defiled by using human dung? For I have never been defiled before. From the time I was a child until now I have never eaten any animal that died of sickness or was killed by other animals. I have never eaten any meat forbidden by the law.°±
26Ezk 4:15 °∞All right,°± the Lord said. °∞You may bake your bread with cow dung instead of human dung.°± 
26Ezk 4:16 Then he told me, °∞Son of man, I will make food very scarce in Jerusalem. It will be weighed out with great care and eaten fearfully. The water will be rationed out drop by drop, and the people will drink it with dismay. 
26Ezk 4:17 Lacking food and water, people will look at one another in terror, and they will waste away under their punishment.
26Ezk 5:1 °∞Son of man, take a sharp sword and use it as a razor to shave your head and beard. Use a scale to weigh the hair into three equal parts. 
26Ezk 5:2 Place a third of it at the center of your map of Jerusalem. After acting out the siege, burn it there. Scatter another third across your map and chop it with a sword. Scatter the last third to the wind, for I will scatter my people with the sword. 
26Ezk 5:3 Keep just a bit of the hair and tie it up in your robe. 
26Ezk 5:4 Then take some of these hairs out and throw them into the fire, burning them up. A fire will then spread from this remnant and destroy all of Israel.
26Ezk 5:5 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ This is an illustration of what will happen to Jerusalem. I placed her at the center of the nations, 
26Ezk 5:6 but she has rebelled against my regulations and decrees and has been even more wicked than the surrounding nations. She has refused to obey the regulations and decrees I gave her to follow.
26Ezk 5:7 °∞Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ You people have behaved worse than your neighbors and have refused to obey my decrees and regulations. You have not even lived up to the standards of the nations around you. 
26Ezk 5:8 Therefore, I myself, the Sovereign Lord, am now your enemy. I will punish you publicly while all the nations watch. 
26Ezk 5:9 Because of your detestable idols, I will punish you like I have never punished anyone before or ever will again. 
26Ezk 5:10 Parents will eat their own children, and children will eat their parents. I will punish you and scatter to the winds the few who survive.
26Ezk 5:11 °∞As surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, I will cut you off completely. I will show you no pity at all because you have defiled my Temple with your vile images and detestable sins. 
26Ezk 5:12 A third of your people will die in the city from disease and famine. A third of them will be slaughtered by the enemy outside the city walls. And I will scatter a third to the winds, chasing them with my sword. 
26Ezk 5:13 Then at last my anger will be spent, and I will be satisfied. And when my fury against them has subsided, all Israel will know that I, the Lord, have spoken to them in my jealous anger.
26Ezk 5:14 °∞So I will turn you into a ruin, a mockery in the eyes of the surrounding nations and to all who pass by. 
26Ezk 5:15 You will become an object of mockery and taunting and horror. You will be a warning to all the nations around you. They will see what happens when the Lord punishes a nation in anger and rebukes it, says the Lord.
26Ezk 5:16 °∞I will shower you with the deadly arrows of famine to destroy you. The famine will become more and more severe until every crumb of food is gone. 
26Ezk 5:17 And along with the famine, wild animals will attack you and rob you of your children. Disease and war will stalk your land, and I will bring the sword of the enemy against you. I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 6:1 Again a message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 6:2 °∞Son of man, turn and face the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them. 
26Ezk 6:3 Proclaim this message from the Sovereign Lord against the mountains of Israel. This is what the Sovereign Lord says to the mountains and hills and to the ravines and valleys£∫ I am about to bring war upon you, and I will smash your pagan shrines. 
26Ezk 6:4 All your altars will be demolished, and your places of worship will be destroyed. I will kill your people in front of your idols®Á. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung; also in 6.5, 6, 9, 13.
26Ezk 6:5 I will lay your corpses in front of your idols and scatter your bones around your altars. 
26Ezk 6:6 Wherever you live there will be desolation, and I will destroy your pagan shrines. Your altars will be demolished, your idols will be smashed, your places of worship will be torn down, and all the religious objects you have made will be destroyed. 
26Ezk 6:7 The place will be littered with corpses, and you will know that I alone am the Lord.
26Ezk 6:8 °∞But I will let a few of my people escape destruction, and they will be scattered among the nations of the world. 
26Ezk 6:9 Then when they are exiled among the nations, they will remember me. They will recognize how hurt I am by their unfaithful hearts and lustful eyes that long for their idols. Then at last they will hate themselves for all their detestable sins. 
26Ezk 6:10 They will know that I alone am the Lord and that I was serious when I said I would bring this calamity on them.
26Ezk 6:11 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Clap your hands in horror, and stamp your feet. Cry out because of all the detestable sins the people of Israel have committed. Now they are going to die from war and famine and disease. 
26Ezk 6:12 Disease will strike down those who are far away in exile. War will destroy those who are nearby. And anyone who survives will be killed by famine. So at last I will spend my fury on them. 
26Ezk 6:13 They will know that I am the Lord when their dead lie scattered among their idols and altars on every hill and mountain and under every green tree and every great shade tree - the places where they offered sacrifices to their idols. 
26Ezk 6:14 I will crush them and make their cities desolate from the wilderness in the south to Riblah®Á in the north. Then they will know that I am the Lord.°± / ®ÁAs in some Hebrew manuscripts; most Hebrew manuscripts read Diblah.
26Ezk 7:1 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 7:2 °∞Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says to Israel£∫ °∞The end is here! Wherever you look - east, west, north, or south - your land is finished.
26Ezk 7:3 No hope remains, for I will unleash my anger against you. I will call you to account for all your detestable sins.
26Ezk 7:4 I will turn my eyes away and show no pity. I will repay you for all your detestable sins. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 7:5 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Disaster after disaster is coming your way!
26Ezk 7:6 The end has come. It has finally arrived. Your final doom is waiting!
26Ezk 7:7 O people of Israel, the day of your destruction is dawning. The time has come; the day of trouble is near. Shouts of anguish will be heard on the mountains, not shouts of joy.
26Ezk 7:8 Soon I will pour out my fury on you and unleash my anger against you. I will call you to account for all your detestable sins.
26Ezk 7:9 I will turn my eyes away and show no pity. I will repay you for all your detestable sins. Then you will know that it is I, the Lord, who is striking the blow.
26Ezk 7:10 °∞The day of judgment is here; your destruction awaits! The people°Øs wickedness and pride have blossomed to full flower.
26Ezk 7:11 Their violence has grown into a rod that will beat them for their wickedness. None of these proud and wicked people will survive. All their wealth and prestige will be swept away.
26Ezk 7:12 Yes, the time has come; the day is here! Buyers should not rejoice over bargains, nor sellers grieve over losses, for all of them will fall under my terrible anger.
26Ezk 7:13 Even if the merchants survive, they will never return to their business. For what God has said applies to everyone - it will not be changed! Not one person whose life is twisted by sin will ever recover.
26Ezk 7:14 °∞The trumpet calls Israel°Øs army to mobilize, but no one listens, for my fury is against them all.
26Ezk 7:15 There is war outside the city and disease and famine within. Those outside the city walls will be killed by enemy swords. Those inside the city will die of famine and disease.
26Ezk 7:16 The survivors who escape to the mountains will moan like doves, weeping for their sins.
26Ezk 7:17 Their hands will hang limp, their knees will be weak as water.
26Ezk 7:18 They will dress themselves in burlap; horror and shame will cover them. They will shave their heads in sorrow and remorse.
26Ezk 7:19 °∞They will throw their money in the streets, tossing it out like worthless trash. Their silver and gold won°Øt save them on that day of the Lord°Øs anger. It will neither satisfy nor feed them, for their greed can only trip them up.
26Ezk 7:20 They were proud of their beautiful jewelry and used it to make detestable idols and vile images. Therefore, I will make all their wealth disgusting to them.
26Ezk 7:21 I will give it as plunder to foreigners, to the most wicked of nations, and they will defile it.
26Ezk 7:22 I will turn my eyes from them as these robbers invade and defile my treasured land.
26Ezk 7:23 °∞Prepare chains for my people, for the land is bloodied by terrible crimes. Jerusalem is filled with violence.
26Ezk 7:24 I will bring the most ruthless of nations to occupy their homes. I will break down their proud fortresses and defile their sanctuaries.
26Ezk 7:25 Terror and trembling will overcome my people. They will look for peace but not find it.
26Ezk 7:26 Calamity will follow calamity; rumor will follow rumor. They will look in vain for a vision from the prophets. They will receive no teaching from the priests and no counsel from the leaders.
26Ezk 7:27 The king and the prince will stand helpless, weeping in despair, and the people°Øs hands will tremble with fear. I will bring on them the evil they have done to others, and they will receive the punishment they so richly deserve. Then they will know that I am the Lord.°±
26Ezk 8:1 Then on September 17®Á, during the sixth year of King Jehoiachin°Øs captivity, while the leaders of Judah were in my home, the Sovereign Lord took hold of me. / ®ÁHebrew on the fifth day of the sixth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This event occurred on September 17, 592 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.
26Ezk 8:2 I saw a figure that appeared to be a man. From what appeared to be his waist down, he looked like a burning flame. From the waist up he looked like gleaming amber®Á. / ®ÁOr like burnished metal.
26Ezk 8:3 He reached out what seemed to be a hand and took me by the hair. Then the Spirit lifted me up into the sky and transported me to Jerusalem in a vision from God. I was taken to the north gate of the inner courtyard of the Temple, where there is a large idol that has made the Lord very jealous. 
26Ezk 8:4 Suddenly, the glory of the God of Israel was there, just as I had seen it before in the valley.
26Ezk 8:5 Then the Lord said to me, °∞Son of man, look toward the north.°± So I looked, and there to the north, beside the entrance to the gate near the altar, stood the idol that had made the Lord so jealous.
26Ezk 8:6 °∞Son of man,°± he said, °∞do you see what they are doing? Do you see the detestable sins the people of Israel are committing to drive me from my Temple? But come, and you will see even more detestable sins than these!°± 
26Ezk 8:7 Then he brought me to the door of the Temple courtyard, where I could see a hole in the wall. 
26Ezk 8:8 He said to me, °∞Now, son of man, dig into the wall.°± So I dug into the wall and found a hidden doorway.
26Ezk 8:9 °∞Go in,°± he said, °∞and see the wicked and detestable sins they are committing in there!°± 
26Ezk 8:10 So I went in and saw the walls engraved with all kinds of crawling animals and detestable creatures. I also saw the various idols®Á worshiped by the people of Israel. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung.
26Ezk 8:11 Seventy leaders of Israel were standing there with Jaazaniah son of Shaphan in the center. Each of them held an incense burner, from which a cloud of incense rose above their heads.
26Ezk 8:12 Then the Lord said to me, °∞Son of man, have you seen what the leaders of Israel are doing with their idols in dark rooms? They are saying, °ÆThe Lord doesn°Øt see us; he has deserted our land!°Ø°± 
26Ezk 8:13 Then the Lord added, °∞Come, and I will show you even more detestable sins than these!°±
26Ezk 8:14 He brought me to the north gate of the Lord°Øs Temple, and some women were sitting there, weeping for the god Tammuz. 
26Ezk 8:15 °∞Have you seen this?°± he asked. °∞But I will show you even more detestable sins than these!°±
26Ezk 8:16 Then he brought me into the inner courtyard of the Lord°Øs Temple. At the entrance to the sanctuary, between the entry room and the bronze altar, there were about twenty-five men with their backs to the sanctuary of the Lord. They were facing east, bowing low to the ground, worshiping the sun!
26Ezk 8:17 °∞Have you seen this, son of man?°± he asked. °∞Is it nothing to the people of Judah that they commit these detestable sins, leading the whole nation into violence, thumbing their noses at me, and provoking my anger? 
26Ezk 8:18 Therefore, I will respond in fury. I will neither pity nor spare them. And though they cry for mercy, I will not listen.°±
26Ezk 9:1 Then the Lord thundered, °∞Bring on the men appointed to punish the city! Tell them to bring their weapons with them!°± 
26Ezk 9:2 Six men soon appeared from the upper gate that faces north, each carrying a deadly weapon in his hand. With them was a man dressed in linen, who carried a writer°Øs case at his side. They all went into the Temple courtyard and stood beside the bronze altar.
26Ezk 9:3 Then the glory of the God of Israel rose up from between the cherubim, where it had rested, and moved to the entrance of the Temple. And the Lord called to the man dressed in linen who was carrying the writer°Øs case. 
26Ezk 9:4 He said to him, °∞Walk through the streets of Jerusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of all who weep and sigh because of the detestable sins being committed in their city.°±
26Ezk 9:5 Then I heard the Lord say to the other men, °∞Follow him through the city and kill everyone whose forehead is not marked. Show no mercy; have no pity! 
26Ezk 9:6 Kill them all - old and young, girls and women and little children. But do not touch anyone with the mark. Begin right here at the Temple.°± So they began by killing the seventy leaders.
26Ezk 9:7 °∞Defile the Temple!°± the Lord commanded. °∞Fill its courtyards with corpses. Go!°± So they went and began killing throughout the city.
26Ezk 9:8 While they were out killing, I was all alone. I fell face down on the ground and cried out, °∞O Sovereign Lord! Will your fury against Jerusalem wipe out everyone left in Israel?°±
26Ezk 9:9 Then he said to me, °∞The sins of the people of Israel and Judah are very, very great. The entire land is full of murder; the city is filled with injustice. They are saying, °ÆThe Lord doesn°Øt see it! The Lord has abandoned the land!°Ø 
26Ezk 9:10 So I will not spare them or have any pity on them. I will fully repay them for all they have done.°±
26Ezk 9:11 Then the man in linen clothing, who carried the writer°Øs case, reported back and said, °∞I have done as you commanded.°±
26Ezk 10:1 In my vision I saw what appeared to be a throne of blue lapis lazuli above the crystal surface over the heads of the cherubim. 
26Ezk 10:2 Then the Lord spoke to the man in linen clothing and said, °∞Go between the whirling wheels beneath the cherubim, and take a handful of burning coals and scatter them over the city.°± He did this as I watched.
26Ezk 10:3 The cherubim were standing at the south end of the Temple when the man went in, and the cloud of glory filled the inner courtyard. 
26Ezk 10:4 Then the glory of the Lord rose up from above the cherubim and went over to the door of the Temple. The Temple was filled with this cloud of glory, and the courtyard glowed brightly with the glory of the Lord. 
26Ezk 10:5 The moving wings of the cherubim sounded like the voice of God Almighty®Á and could be heard even in the outer courtyard. / ®ÁHebrew El-Shaddai.
26Ezk 10:6 The Lord said to the man in linen clothing, °∞Go between the cherubim and take some burning coals from between the wheels.°± So the man went in and stood beside one of the wheels. 
26Ezk 10:7 Then one of the cherubim reached out his hand and took some live coals from the fire burning among them. He put the coals into the hands of the man in linen clothing, and the man took them and went out. 
26Ezk 10:8 (All the cherubim had what looked like human hands under their wings.)
26Ezk 10:9 I looked, and each of the four cherubim had a wheel beside him, and the wheels sparkled like beryl. 
26Ezk 10:10 All four wheels looked alike and were made the same; each wheel had a second wheel turning crosswise within it. 
26Ezk 10:11 The cherubim could move in any of the four directions they faced, without turning as they moved. They went straight in the direction they faced, never turning aside. 
26Ezk 10:12 Both the cherubim and the wheels were covered with eyes. The cherubim had eyes all over their bodies, including their hands, their backs, and their wings. 
26Ezk 10:13 I heard someone refer to the wheels as °∞the whirling wheels.°± 
26Ezk 10:14 Each of the four cherubim had four faces£∫ the first was the face of an ox®Á, the second was a human face, the third was the face of a lion, and the fourth was the face of an eagle. / ®ÁHebrew the face of a cherub; compare 1.10.
26Ezk 10:15 Then the cherubim rose upward. These were the same living beings I had seen beside the Kebar River. 
26Ezk 10:16 When the cherubim moved, the wheels moved with them. When they lifted their wings to fly, the wheels stayed beside them. 
26Ezk 10:17 When the cherubim stopped, the wheels stopped. When they flew upward, the wheels rose up, for the spirit of the living beings was in the wheels.
26Ezk 10:18 Then the glory of the Lord moved out from the door of the Temple and hovered above the cherubim. 
26Ezk 10:19 And as I watched, the cherubim flew with their wheels to the east gate of the Lord°Øs Temple. And the glory of the God of Israel hovered above them.
26Ezk 10:20 These were the same living beings I had seen beneath the God of Israel when I was by the Kebar River. I knew they were cherubim, 
26Ezk 10:21 for each had four faces and four wings and what looked like human hands under their wings. 
26Ezk 10:22 And their faces were just like the faces of the beings I had seen at the Kebar, and they traveled straight ahead, just as the others had.
26Ezk 11:1 Then the Spirit lifted me and brought me to the east gateway of the Lord°Øs Temple, where I saw twenty-five prominent men of the city. Among them were Jaazaniah son of Azzur and Pelatiah son of Benaiah, who were leaders among the people.
26Ezk 11:2 The Spirit said to me, °∞Son of man, these are the men who are planning evil and giving wicked counsel in this city. 
26Ezk 11:3 They say to the people, °ÆIs it not a good time to build houses? This city is like an iron pot. We are safe inside it like meat in a pot®Á.°Ø / ®ÁHebrew This city is the pot, and we are the meat.
26Ezk 11:4 Therefore, son of man, prophesy against them loudly and clearly.°±
26Ezk 11:5 Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon me, and he told me to say, °∞This is what the Lord says to the people of Israel£∫ I know what you are saying, for I know every thought that comes into your minds. 
26Ezk 11:6 You have murdered many in this city and filled its streets with the dead.
26Ezk 11:7 °∞Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ This city is an iron pot all right, but the pieces of meat are the victims of your injustice. As for you, I will soon drag you from this pot. 
26Ezk 11:8 I will bring on you the sword of war you so greatly fear, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 11:9 I will drive you out of Jerusalem and hand you over to foreigners, who will carry out my judgments against you. 
26Ezk 11:10 You will be slaughtered all the way to the borders of Israel. I will execute judgment on you, and you will know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 11:11 No, this city will not be an iron pot for you, and you will not be like meat safe inside it. I will judge you even to the borders of Israel, 
26Ezk 11:12 and you will know that I am the Lord. For you have refused to obey my decrees and regulations; instead, you have copied the standards of the nations around you.°±
26Ezk 11:13 While I was still prophesying, Pelatiah son of Benaiah suddenly died. Then I fell face down on the ground and cried out, °∞O Sovereign Lord, are you going to kill everyone in Israel?°±
26Ezk 11:14 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 11:15 °∞Son of man, the people still left in Jerusalem are talking about you and your relatives and all the people of Israel who are in exile. They are saying, °ÆThose people are far away from the Lord, so now he has given their land to us!°Ø
26Ezk 11:16 °∞Therefore, tell the exiles, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Although I have scattered you in the countries of the world, I will be a sanctuary to you during your time in exile. 
26Ezk 11:17 I, the Sovereign Lord, will gather you back from the nations where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of Israel once again.°Ø
26Ezk 11:18 °∞When the people return to their homeland, they will remove every trace of their vile images and detestable idols. 
26Ezk 11:19 And I will give them singleness of heart and put a new spirit within them. I will take away their stony, stubborn heart and give them a tender, responsive heart®Á, / ®ÁHebrew a heart of flesh.
26Ezk 11:20 so they will obey my decrees and regulations. Then they will truly be my people, and I will be their God. 
26Ezk 11:21 But as for those who long for vile images and detestable idols, I will repay them fully for their sins. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 11:22 Then the cherubim lifted their wings and rose into the air with their wheels beside them, and the glory of the God of Israel hovered above them. 
26Ezk 11:23 Then the glory of the Lord went up from the city and stopped above the mountain to the east.
26Ezk 11:24 Afterward the Spirit of God carried me back again to Babylonia®Á, to the people in exile there. And so ended the vision of my visit to Jerusalem. / ®ÁOr Chaldea.
26Ezk 11:25 And I told the exiles everything the Lord had shown me.
26Ezk 12:1 Again a message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 12:2 °∞Son of man, you live among rebels who have eyes but refuse to see. They have ears but refuse to hear. For they are a rebellious people.
26Ezk 12:3 °∞So now, son of man, pretend you are being sent into exile. Pack the few items an exile could carry, and leave your home to go somewhere else. Do this right in front of the people so they can see you. For perhaps they will pay attention to this, even though they are such rebels. 
26Ezk 12:4 Bring your baggage outside during the day so they can watch you. Then in the evening, as they are watching, leave your house as captives do when they begin a long march to distant lands. 
26Ezk 12:5 Dig a hole through the wall while they are watching and go out through it. 
26Ezk 12:6 As they watch, lift your pack to your shoulders and walk away into the night. Cover your face so you cannot see the land you are leaving. For I have made you a sign for the people of Israel.°±
26Ezk 12:7 So I did as I was told. In broad daylight I brought my pack outside, filled with the things I might carry into exile. Then in the evening while the people looked on, I dug through the wall with my hands and went out into the night with my pack on my shoulder.
26Ezk 12:8 The next morning this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 12:9 °∞Son of man, these rebels, the people of Israel, have asked you what all this means. 
26Ezk 12:10 Say to them, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ These actions contain a message for King Zedekiah in Jerusalem®Á and for all the people of Israel.°Ø / ®ÁHebrew the prince in Jerusalem; similarly in 12.12.
26Ezk 12:11 Explain that your actions are a sign to show what will soon happen to them, for they will be driven into exile as captives.
26Ezk 12:12 °∞Even Zedekiah will leave Jerusalem at night through a hole in the wall, taking only what he can carry with him. He will cover his face, and his eyes will not see the land he is leaving. 
26Ezk 12:13 Then I will throw my net over him and capture him in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon, the land of the Babylonians®Á, though he will never see it, and he will die there. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans.
26Ezk 12:14 I will scatter his servants and warriors to the four winds and send the sword after them. 
26Ezk 12:15 And when I scatter them among the nations, they will know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 12:16 But I will spare a few of them from death by war, famine, or disease, so they can confess all their detestable sins to their captors. Then they will know that I am the Lord.°±
26Ezk 12:17 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 12:18 °∞Son of man, tremble as you eat your food. Shake with fear as you drink your water. 
26Ezk 12:19 Tell the people, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says concerning those living in Israel and Jerusalem£∫ They will eat their food with trembling and sip their water in despair, for their land will be stripped bare because of their violence. 
26Ezk 12:20 The cities will be destroyed and the farmland made desolate. Then you will know that I am the Lord.°Ø°±
26Ezk 12:21 Again a message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 12:22 °∞Son of man, you°Øve heard that proverb they quote in Israel£∫ °ÆTime passes, and prophecies come to nothing.°Ø 
26Ezk 12:23 Tell the people, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will put an end to this proverb, and you will soon stop quoting it.°Ø Now give them this new proverb to replace the old one£∫ °ÆThe time has come for every prophecy to be fulfilled!°Ø
26Ezk 12:24 °∞There will be no more false visions and flattering predictions in Israel. 
26Ezk 12:25 For I am the Lord! If I say it, it will happen. There will be no more delays, you rebels of Israel. I will fulfill my threat of destruction in your own lifetime. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 12:26 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 12:27 °∞Son of man, the people of Israel are saying, °ÆHe°Øs talking about the distant future. His visions won°Øt come true for a long, long time.°Ø 
26Ezk 12:28 Therefore, tell them, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ No more delay! I will now do everything I have threatened. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°Ø°±
26Ezk 13:1 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 13:2 °∞Son of man, prophesy against the false prophets of Israel who are inventing their own prophecies. Say to them, °ÆListen to the word of the Lord. 
26Ezk 13:3 This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ What sorrow awaits the false prophets who are following their own imaginations and have seen nothing at all!°Ø
26Ezk 13:4 °∞O people of Israel, these prophets of yours are like jackals digging in the ruins. 
26Ezk 13:5 They have done nothing to repair the breaks in the walls around the nation. They have not helped it to stand firm in battle on the day of the Lord. 
26Ezk 13:6 Instead, they have told lies and made false predictions. They say, °ÆThis message is from the Lord,°Ø even though the Lord never sent them. And yet they expect him to fulfill their prophecies! 
26Ezk 13:7 Can your visions be anything but false if you claim, °ÆThis message is from the Lord,°Ø when I have not even spoken to you?
26Ezk 13:8 °∞Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Because what you say is false and your visions are a lie, I will stand against you, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 13:9 I will raise my fist against all the prophets who see false visions and make lying predictions, and they will be banished from the community of Israel. I will blot their names from Israel°Øs record books, and they will never again set foot in their own land. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.
26Ezk 13:10 °∞This will happen because these evil prophets deceive my people by saying, °ÆAll is peaceful°Ø when there is no peace at all! It°Øs as if the people have built a flimsy wall, and these prophets are trying to reinforce it by covering it with whitewash! 
26Ezk 13:11 Tell these whitewashers that their wall will soon fall down. A heavy rainstorm will undermine it; great hailstones and mighty winds will knock it down. 
26Ezk 13:12 And when the wall falls, the people will cry out, °ÆWhat happened to your whitewash?°Ø
26Ezk 13:13 °∞Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will sweep away your whitewashed wall with a storm of indignation, with a great flood of anger, and with hailstones of fury. 
26Ezk 13:14 I will break down your wall right to its foundation, and when it falls, it will crush you. Then you will know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 13:15 At last my anger against the wall and those who covered it with whitewash will be satisfied. Then I will say to you£∫ °ÆThe wall and those who whitewashed it are both gone. 
26Ezk 13:16 They were lying prophets who claimed peace would come to Jerusalem when there was no peace. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°Ø
26Ezk 13:17 °∞Now, son of man, speak out against the women who prophesy from their own imaginations. 
26Ezk 13:18 This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ What sorrow awaits you women who are ensnaring the souls of my people, young and old alike. You tie magic charms on their wrists and furnish them with magic veils. Do you think you can trap others without bringing destruction on yourselves? 
26Ezk 13:19 You bring shame on me among my people for a few handfuls of barley or a piece of bread. By lying to my people who love to listen to lies, you kill those who should not die, and you promise life to those who should not live.
26Ezk 13:20 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I am against all your magic charms, which you use to ensnare my people like birds. I will tear them from your arms, setting my people free like birds set free from a cage. 
26Ezk 13:21 I will tear off the magic veils and save my people from your grasp. They will no longer be your victims. Then you will know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 13:22 You have discouraged the righteous with your lies, but I didn°Øt want them to be sad. And you have encouraged the wicked by promising them life, even though they continue in their sins. 
26Ezk 13:23 Because of all this, you will no longer talk of seeing visions that you never saw, nor will you make predictions. For I will rescue my people from your grasp. Then you will know that I am the Lord.°±
26Ezk 14:1 Then some of the leaders of Israel visited me, and while they were sitting with me, 
26Ezk 14:2 this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 14:3 °∞Son of man, these leaders have set up idols®Á in their hearts. They have embraced things that will make them fall into sin. Why should I listen to their requests? / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung; also in 14.4, 5, 6, 7.
26Ezk 14:4 Tell them, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ The people of Israel have set up idols in their hearts and fallen into sin, and then they go to a prophet asking for a message. So I, the Lord, will give them the kind of answer their great idolatry deserves. 
26Ezk 14:5 I will do this to capture the minds and hearts of all my people who have turned from me to worship their detestable idols.°Ø
26Ezk 14:6 °∞Therefore, tell the people of Israel, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Repent and turn away from your idols, and stop all your detestable sins. 
26Ezk 14:7 I, the Lord, will answer all those, both Israelites and foreigners, who reject me and set up idols in their hearts and so fall into sin, and who then come to a prophet asking for my advice. 
26Ezk 14:8 I will turn against such people and make a terrible example of them, eliminating them from among my people. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 14:9 °∞°ÆAnd if a prophet is deceived into giving a message, it is because I, the Lord, have deceived that prophet. I will lift my fist against such prophets and cut them off from the community of Israel. 
26Ezk 14:10 False prophets and those who seek their guidance will all be punished for their sins. 
26Ezk 14:11 In this way, the people of Israel will learn not to stray from me, polluting themselves with sin. They will be my people, and I will be their God. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°Ø°±
26Ezk 14:12 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 14:13 °∞Son of man, suppose the people of a country were to sin against me, and I lifted my fist to crush them, cutting off their food supply and sending a famine to destroy both people and animals. 
26Ezk 14:14 Even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were there, their righteousness would save no one but themselves, says the Sovereign Lord.
26Ezk 14:15 °∞Or suppose I were to send wild animals to invade the country, kill the people, and make the land too desolate and dangerous to pass through. 
26Ezk 14:16 As surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, even if those three men were there, they wouldn°Øt be able to save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved, but the land would be made desolate.
26Ezk 14:17 °∞Or suppose I were to bring war against the land, and I sent enemy armies to destroy both people and animals. 
26Ezk 14:18 As surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, even if those three men were there, they wouldn°Øt be able to save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved.
26Ezk 14:19 °∞Or suppose I were to pour out my fury by sending an epidemic into the land, and the disease killed people and animals alike. 
26Ezk 14:20 As surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, even if Noah, Daniel, and Job were there, they wouldn°Øt be able to save their own sons or daughters. They alone would be saved by their righteousness.
26Ezk 14:21 °∞Now this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ How terrible it will be when all four of these dreadful punishments fall upon Jerusalem - war, famine, wild animals, and disease - destroying all her people and animals. 
26Ezk 14:22 Yet there will be survivors, and they will come here to join you as exiles in Babylon. You will see with your own eyes how wicked they are, and then you will feel better about what I have done to Jerusalem. 
26Ezk 14:23 When you meet them and see their behavior, you will understand that these things are not being done to Israel without cause. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 15:1 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 15:2 °∞Son of man, how does a grapevine compare to a tree? Is a vine°Øs wood as useful as the wood of a tree? 
26Ezk 15:3 Can its wood be used for making things, like pegs to hang up pots and pans? 
26Ezk 15:4 No, it can only be used for fuel, and even as fuel, it burns too quickly. 
26Ezk 15:5 Vines are useless both before and after being put into the fire!
26Ezk 15:6 °∞And this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ The people of Jerusalem are like grapevines growing among the trees of the forest. Since they are useless, I have thrown them on the fire to be burned. 
26Ezk 15:7 And I will see to it that if they escape from one fire, they will fall into another. When I turn against them, you will know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 15:8 And I will make the land desolate because my people have been unfaithful to me. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 16:1 Then another message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 16:2 °∞Son of man, confront Jerusalem with her detestable sins. 
26Ezk 16:3 Give her this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ You are nothing but a Canaanite! Your father was an Amorite and your mother a Hittite. 
26Ezk 16:4 On the day you were born, no one cared about you. Your umbilical cord was not cut, and you were never washed, rubbed with salt, and wrapped in cloth. 
26Ezk 16:5 No one had the slightest interest in you; no one pitied you or cared for you. On the day you were born, you were unwanted, dumped in a field and left to die.
26Ezk 16:6 °∞But I came by and saw you there, helplessly kicking about in your own blood. As you lay there, I said, °ÆLive!°Ø 
26Ezk 16:7 And I helped you to thrive like a plant in the field. You grew up and became a beautiful jewel. Your breasts became full, and your body hair grew, but you were still naked. 
26Ezk 16:8 And when I passed by again, I saw that you were old enough for love. So I wrapped my cloak around you to cover your nakedness and declared my marriage vows. I made a covenant with you, says the Sovereign Lord, and you became mine.
26Ezk 16:9 °∞Then I bathed you and washed off your blood, and I rubbed fragrant oils into your skin. 
26Ezk 16:10 I gave you expensive clothing of fine linen and silk, beautifully embroidered, and sandals made of fine goatskin leather. 
26Ezk 16:11 I gave you lovely jewelry, bracelets, beautiful necklaces, 
26Ezk 16:12 a ring for your nose, earrings for your ears, and a lovely crown for your head. 
26Ezk 16:13 And so you were adorned with gold and silver. Your clothes were made of fine linen and were beautifully embroidered. You ate the finest foods - choice flour, honey, and olive oil - and became more beautiful than ever. You looked like a queen, and so you were! 
26Ezk 16:14 Your fame soon spread throughout the world because of your beauty. I dressed you in my splendor and perfected your beauty, says the Sovereign Lord.
26Ezk 16:15 °∞But you thought your fame and beauty were your own. So you gave yourself as a prostitute to every man who came along. Your beauty was theirs for the asking. 
26Ezk 16:16 You used the lovely things I gave you to make shrines for idols, where you played the prostitute. Unbelievable! How could such a thing ever happen? 
26Ezk 16:17 You took the very jewels and gold and silver ornaments I had given you and made statues of men and worshiped them. This is adultery against me! 
26Ezk 16:18 You used the beautifully embroidered clothes I gave you to dress your idols. Then you used my special oil and my incense to worship them. 
26Ezk 16:19 Imagine it! You set before them as a sacrifice the choice flour, olive oil, and honey I had given you, says the Sovereign Lord.
26Ezk 16:20 °∞Then you took your sons and daughters - the children you had borne to me - and sacrificed them to your gods. Was your prostitution not enough? 
26Ezk 16:21 Must you also slaughter my children by sacrificing them to idols? 
26Ezk 16:22 In all your years of adultery and detestable sin, you have not once remembered the days long ago when you lay naked in a field, kicking about in your own blood.
26Ezk 16:23 °∞What sorrow awaits you, says the Sovereign Lord. In addition to all your other wickedness, 
26Ezk 16:24 you built a pagan shrine and put altars to idols in every town square. 
26Ezk 16:25 On every street corner you defiled your beauty, offering your body to every passerby in an endless stream of prostitution. 
26Ezk 16:26 Then you added lustful Egypt to your lovers, provoking my anger with your increasing promiscuity. 
26Ezk 16:27 That is why I struck you with my fist and reduced your boundaries. I handed you over to your enemies, the Philistines, and even they were shocked by your lewd conduct. 
26Ezk 16:28 You have prostituted yourself with the Assyrians, too. It seems you can never find enough new lovers! And after your prostitution there, you still were not satisfied. 
26Ezk 16:29 You added to your lovers by embracing Babylonia®Á, the land of merchants, but you still weren°Øt satisfied. / ®ÁOr Chaldea.
26Ezk 16:30 °∞What a sick heart you have, says the Sovereign Lord, to do such things as these, acting like a shameless prostitute. 
26Ezk 16:31 You build your pagan shrines on every street corner and your altars to idols in every square. In fact, you have been worse than a prostitute, so eager for sin that you have not even demanded payment.
26Ezk 16:32 Yes, you are an adulterous wife who takes in strangers instead of her own husband. 
26Ezk 16:33 Prostitutes charge for their services - but not you! You give gifts to your lovers, bribing them to come and have sex with you. 
26Ezk 16:34 So you are the opposite of other prostitutes. You pay your lovers instead of their paying you!
26Ezk 16:35 °∞Therefore, you prostitute, listen to this message from the Lord! 
26Ezk 16:36 This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Because you have poured out your lust and exposed yourself in prostitution to all your lovers, and because you have worshiped detestable idols®Á, and because you have slaughtered your children as sacrifices to your gods, / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung.
26Ezk 16:37 this is what I am going to do. I will gather together all your allies - the lovers with whom you have sinned, both those you loved and those you hated - and I will strip you naked in front of them so they can stare at you. 
26Ezk 16:38 I will punish you for your murder and adultery. I will cover you with blood in my jealous fury. 
26Ezk 16:39 Then I will give you to these many nations who are your lovers, and they will destroy you. They will knock down your pagan shrines and the altars to your idols. They will strip you and take your beautiful jewels, leaving you stark naked. 
26Ezk 16:40 They will band together in a mob to stone you and cut you up with swords. 
26Ezk 16:41 They will burn your homes and punish you in front of many women. I will stop your prostitution and end your payments to your many lovers.
26Ezk 16:42 °∞Then at last my fury against you will be spent, and my jealous anger will subside. I will be calm and will not be angry with you anymore. 
26Ezk 16:43 But first, because you have not remembered your youth but have angered me by doing all these evil things, I will fully repay you for all of your sins, says the Sovereign Lord. For you have added lewd acts to all your detestable sins. 
26Ezk 16:44 Everyone who makes up proverbs will say of you, °ÆLike mother, like daughter.°Ø 
26Ezk 16:45 For your mother loathed her husband and her children, and so do you. And you are exactly like your sisters, for they despised their husbands and their children. Truly your mother was a Hittite and your father an Amorite.
26Ezk 16:46 °∞Your older sister was Samaria, who lived with her daughters in the north. Your younger sister was Sodom, who lived with her daughters in the south. 
26Ezk 16:47 But you have not merely sinned as they did. You quickly surpassed them in corruption. 
26Ezk 16:48 As surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, Sodom and her daughters were never as wicked as you and your daughters. 
26Ezk 16:49 Sodom°Øs sins were pride, gluttony, and laziness, while the poor and needy suffered outside her door. 
26Ezk 16:50 She was proud and committed detestable sins, so I wiped her out, as you have seen®Á. / ®ÁAs in a few Hebrew manuscripts and Greek version; Masoretic Text reads as I have seen.
26Ezk 16:51 °∞Even Samaria did not commit half your sins. You have done far more detestable things than your sisters ever did. They seem righteous compared to you. 
26Ezk 16:52 Shame on you! Your sins are so terrible that you make your sisters seem righteous, even virtuous.
26Ezk 16:53 °∞But someday I will restore the fortunes of Sodom and Samaria, and I will restore you, too. 
26Ezk 16:54 Then you will be truly ashamed of everything you have done, for your sins make them feel good in comparison. 
26Ezk 16:55 Yes, your sisters, Sodom and Samaria, and all their people will be restored, and at that time you also will be restored. 
26Ezk 16:56 In your proud days you held Sodom in contempt. 
26Ezk 16:57 But now your greater wickedness has been exposed to all the world, and you are the one who is scorned - by Edom®Á and all her neighbors and by Philistia. / ®ÁMany ancient manuscripts read Aram.
26Ezk 16:58 This is your punishment for all your lewdness and detestable sins, says the Lord.
26Ezk 16:59 °∞Now this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will give you what you deserve, for you have taken your solemn vows lightly by breaking your covenant. 
26Ezk 16:60 Yet I will remember the covenant I made with you when you were young, and I will establish an everlasting covenant with you. 
26Ezk 16:61 Then you will remember with shame all the evil you have done. I will make your sisters, Samaria and Sodom, to be your daughters, even though they are not part of our covenant. 
26Ezk 16:62 And I will reaffirm my covenant with you, and you will know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 16:63 You will remember your sins and cover your mouth in silent shame when I forgive you of all that you have done. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 17:1 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 17:2 °∞Son of man, give this riddle, and tell this story to the people of Israel. 
26Ezk 17:3 Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord. °∞A great eagle with broad wings and long feathers, covered with many-colored plumage, came to Lebanon. He seized the top of a cedar tree
26Ezk 17:4 and plucked off its highest branch. He carried it away to a city filled with merchants. He planted it in a city of traders.
26Ezk 17:5 He also took a seedling from the land and planted it in fertile soil. He placed it beside a broad river, where it could grow like a willow tree.
26Ezk 17:6 It took root there and grew into a low, spreading vine. Its branches turned up toward the eagle, and its roots grew down into the ground. It produced strong branches and put out shoots.
26Ezk 17:7 But then another great eagle came with broad wings and full plumage. So the vine now sent its roots and branches toward him for water,
26Ezk 17:8 even though it was already planted in good soil and had plenty of water so it could grow into a splendid vine and produce rich leaves and luscious fruit.
26Ezk 17:9 °∞So now the Sovereign Lord asks. Will this vine grow and prosper? No! I will pull it up, roots and all! I will cut off its fruit and let its leaves wither and die. I will pull it up easily without a strong arm or a large army.
26Ezk 17:10 But when the vine is transplanted, will it thrive? No, it will wither away when the east wind blows against it. It will die in the same good soil where it had grown so well.°±
26Ezk 17:11 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 17:12 °∞Say to these rebels of Israel£∫ Don°Øt you understand the meaning of this riddle of the eagles? The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, took away her king and princes, and brought them to Babylon. 
26Ezk 17:13 He made a treaty with a member of the royal family and forced him to take an oath of loyalty. He also exiled Israel°Øs most influential leaders, 
26Ezk 17:14 so Israel would not become strong again and revolt. Only by keeping her treaty with Babylon could Israel survive.
26Ezk 17:15 °∞Nevertheless, this man of Israel°Øs royal family rebelled against Babylon, sending ambassadors to Egypt to request a great army and many horses. Can Israel break her sworn treaties like that and get away with it? 
26Ezk 17:16 No! For as surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, the king of Israel will die in Babylon, the land of the king who put him in power and whose treaty he disregarded and broke. 
26Ezk 17:17 Pharaoh and all his mighty army will fail to help Israel when the king of Babylon lays siege to Jerusalem again and destroys many lives. 
26Ezk 17:18 For the king of Israel disregarded his treaty and broke it after swearing to obey; therefore, he will not escape.
26Ezk 17:19 °∞So this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ As surely as I live, I will punish him for breaking my covenant and disregarding the solemn oath he made in my name. 
26Ezk 17:20 I will throw my net over him and capture him in my snare. I will bring him to Babylon and put him on trial for this treason against me. 
26Ezk 17:21 And all his best warriors®Á will be killed in battle, and those who survive will be scattered to the four winds. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken. / ®ÁOr his fleeing warriors. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
26Ezk 17:22 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will take a branch from the top of a tall cedar, and I will plant it on the top of Israel°Øs highest mountain. 
26Ezk 17:23 It will become a majestic cedar, sending forth its branches and producing seed. Birds of every sort will nest in it, finding shelter in the shade of its branches. 
26Ezk 17:24 And all the trees will know that it is I, the Lord, who cuts the tall tree down and makes the short tree grow tall. It is I who makes the green tree wither and gives the dead tree new life. I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do what I said!°±
26Ezk 18:1 Then another message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 18:2 °∞Why do you quote this proverb concerning the land of Israel£∫ °ÆThe parents have eaten sour grapes, but their children°Øs mouths pucker at the taste°Ø? 
26Ezk 18:3 As surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, you will not quote this proverb anymore in Israel. 
26Ezk 18:4 For all people are mine to judge - both parents and children alike. And this is my rule£∫ The person who sins is the one who will die.
26Ezk 18:5 °∞Suppose a certain man is righteous and does what is just and right. 
26Ezk 18:6 He does not feast in the mountains before Israel°Øs idols®Á or worship them. He does not commit adultery or have intercourse with a woman during her menstrual period. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung; also in 18.12, 15.
26Ezk 18:7 He is a merciful creditor, not keeping the items given as security by poor debtors. He does not rob the poor but instead gives food to the hungry and provides clothes for the needy. 
26Ezk 18:8 He grants loans without interest, stays away from injustice, is honest and fair when judging others, 
26Ezk 18:9 and faithfully obeys my decrees and regulations. Anyone who does these things is just and will surely live, says the Sovereign Lord.
26Ezk 18:10 °∞But suppose that man has a son who grows up to be a robber or murderer and refuses to do what is right. 
26Ezk 18:11 And that son does all the evil things his father would never do - he worships idols on the mountains, commits adultery, 
26Ezk 18:12 oppresses the poor and helpless, steals from debtors by refusing to let them redeem their security, worships idols, commits detestable sins, 
26Ezk 18:13 and lends money at excessive interest. Should such a sinful person live? No! He must die and must take full blame.
26Ezk 18:14 °∞But suppose that sinful son, in turn, has a son who sees his father°Øs wickedness and decides against that kind of life. 
26Ezk 18:15 This son refuses to worship idols on the mountains and does not commit adultery. 
26Ezk 18:16 He does not exploit the poor, but instead is fair to debtors and does not rob them. He gives food to the hungry and provides clothes for the needy. 
26Ezk 18:17 He helps the poor, does not lend money at interest, and obeys all my regulations and decrees. Such a person will not die because of his father°Øs sins; he will surely live. 
26Ezk 18:18 But the father will die for his many sins - for being cruel, robbing people, and doing what was clearly wrong among his people.
26Ezk 18:19 °∞°ÆWhat?°Ø you ask. °ÆDoesn°Øt the child pay for the parent°Øs sins?°Ø No! For if the child does what is just and right and keeps my decrees, that child will surely live.
26Ezk 18:20 The person who sins is the one who will die. The child will not be punished for the parent°Øs sins, and the parent will not be punished for the child°Øs sins. Righteous people will be rewarded for their own righteous behavior, and wicked people will be punished for their own wickedness. 
26Ezk 18:21 But if wicked people turn away from all their sins and begin to obey my decrees and do what is just and right, they will surely live and not die. 
26Ezk 18:22 All their past sins will be forgotten, and they will live because of the righteous things they have done.
26Ezk 18:23 °∞Do you think that I like to see wicked people die? says the Sovereign Lord. Of course not! I want them to turn from their wicked ways and live. 
26Ezk 18:24 However, if righteous people turn from their righteous behavior and start doing sinful things and act like other sinners, should they be allowed to live? No, of course not! All their righteous acts will be forgotten, and they will die for their sins.
26Ezk 18:25 °∞Yet you say, °ÆThe Lord isn°Øt doing what°Øs right!°Ø Listen to me, O people of Israel. Am I the one not doing what°Øs right, or is it you? 
26Ezk 18:26 When righteous people turn from their righteous behavior and start doing sinful things, they will die for it. Yes, they will die because of their sinful deeds. 
26Ezk 18:27 And if wicked people turn from their wickedness, obey the law, and do what is just and right, they will save their lives. 
26Ezk 18:28 They will live because they thought it over and decided to turn from their sins. Such people will not die. 
26Ezk 18:29 And yet the people of Israel keep saying, °ÆThe Lord isn°Øt doing what°Øs right!°Ø O people of Israel, it is you who are not doing what°Øs right, not I.
26Ezk 18:30 °∞Therefore, I will judge each of you, O people of Israel, according to your actions, says the Sovereign Lord. Repent, and turn from your sins. Don°Øt let them destroy you! 
26Ezk 18:31 Put all your rebellion behind you, and find yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For why should you die, O people of Israel? 
26Ezk 18:32 I don°Øt want you to die, says the Sovereign Lord. Turn back and live!
26Ezk 19:1 °∞Sing this funeral song for the princes of Israel.
26Ezk 19:2 °∞What is your mother? A lioness among lions! She lay down among the young lions and reared her cubs.
26Ezk 19:3 She raised one of her cubs to become a strong young lion. He learned to hunt and devour prey, and he became a man-eater.
26Ezk 19:4 Then the nations heard about him, and he was trapped in their pit. They led him away with hooks to the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 19:5 °∞When the lioness saw that her hopes for him were gone, she took another of her cubs and taught him to be a strong young lion.
26Ezk 19:6 He prowled among the other lions and stood out among them in his strength. He learned to hunt and devour prey, and he, too, became a man-eater.
26Ezk 19:7 He demolished fortresses®Á and destroyed their towns and cities. Their farms were desolated, and their crops were destroyed. The land and its people trembled in fear when they heard him roar. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads He knew widows.
26Ezk 19:8 Then the armies of the nations attacked him, surrounding him from every direction. They threw a net over him and captured him in their pit.
26Ezk 19:9 With hooks, they dragged him into a cage and brought him before the king of Babylon. They held him in captivity, so his voice could never again be heard on the mountains of Israel.
26Ezk 19:10 °∞Your mother was like a vine planted by the water°Øs edge. It had lush, green foliage because of the abundant water.
26Ezk 19:11 Its branches became strong - strong enough to be a ruler°Øs scepter. It grew very tall, towering above all others. It stood out because of its height and its many lush branches.
26Ezk 19:12 But the vine was uprooted in fury and thrown down to the ground. The desert wind dried up its fruit and tore off its strong branches, so that it withered and was destroyed by fire.
26Ezk 19:13 Now the vine is transplanted to the wilderness, where the ground is hard and dry.
26Ezk 19:14 A fire has burst out from its branches and devoured its fruit. Its remaining limbs are not strong enough to be a ruler°Øs scepter. °∞This is a funeral song, and it will be used in a funeral.°±
26Ezk 20:1 On August 14®Á, during the seventh year of King Jehoiachin°Øs captivity, some of the leaders of Israel came to request a message from the Lord. They sat down in front of me to wait for his reply. / ®ÁHebrew In the fifth month, on the tenth day, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was August 14, 591 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.
26Ezk 20:2 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 20:3 °∞Son of man, tell the leaders of Israel, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ How dare you come to ask me for a message? As surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, I will tell you nothing!°Ø
26Ezk 20:4 °∞Son of man, bring charges against them and condemn them. Make them realize how detestable the sins of their ancestors really were. 
26Ezk 20:5 Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ When I chose Israel - when I revealed myself to the descendants of Jacob in Egypt - I took a solemn oath that I, the Lord, would be their God. 
26Ezk 20:6 I took a solemn oath that day that I would bring them out of Egypt to a land I had discovered and explored for them - a good land, a land flowing with milk and honey, the best of all lands anywhere. 
26Ezk 20:7 Then I said to them, °ÆEach of you, get rid of the vile images you are so obsessed with. Do not defile yourselves with the idols®Á of Egypt, for I am the Lord your God.°Ø / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung; also in 20.8, 16, 18, 24, 31, 39.
26Ezk 20:8 °∞But they rebelled against me and would not listen. They did not get rid of the vile images they were obsessed with, or forsake the idols of Egypt. Then I threatened to pour out my fury on them to satisfy my anger while they were still in Egypt. 
26Ezk 20:9 But I didn°Øt do it, for I acted to protect the honor of my name. I would not allow shame to be brought on my name among the surrounding nations who saw me reveal myself by bringing the Israelites out of Egypt. 
26Ezk 20:10 So I brought them out of Egypt and led them into the wilderness. 
26Ezk 20:11 There I gave them my decrees and regulations so they could find life by keeping them. 
26Ezk 20:12 And I gave them my Sabbath days of rest as a sign between them and me. It was to remind them that I am the Lord, who had set them apart to be holy.
26Ezk 20:13 °∞But the people of Israel rebelled against me, and they refused to obey my decrees there in the wilderness. They wouldn°Øt obey my regulations even though obedience would have given them life. They also violated my Sabbath days. So I threatened to pour out my fury on them, and I made plans to utterly consume them in the wilderness. 
26Ezk 20:14 But again I held back in order to protect the honor of my name before the nations who had seen my power in bringing Israel out of Egypt. 
26Ezk 20:15 But I took a solemn oath against them in the wilderness. I swore I would not bring them into the land I had given them, a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful place on earth. 
26Ezk 20:16 For they had rejected my regulations, refused to follow my decrees, and violated my Sabbath days. Their hearts were given to their idols. 
26Ezk 20:17 Nevertheless, I took pity on them and held back from destroying them in the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:18 °∞Then I warned their children not to follow in their parents°Ø footsteps, defiling themselves with their idols. 
26Ezk 20:19 °ÆI am the Lord your God,°Ø I told them. °ÆFollow my decrees, pay attention to my regulations, 
26Ezk 20:20 and keep my Sabbath days holy, for they are a sign to remind you that I am the Lord your God.°Ø
26Ezk 20:21 °∞But their children, too, rebelled against me. They refused to keep my decrees and follow my regulations, even though obedience would have given them life. And they also violated my Sabbath days. So again I threatened to pour out my fury on them in the wilderness. 
26Ezk 20:22 Nevertheless, I withdrew my judgment against them to protect the honor of my name before the nations that had seen my power in bringing them out of Egypt. 
26Ezk 20:23 But I took a solemn oath against them in the wilderness. I swore I would scatter them among all the nations 
26Ezk 20:24 because they did not obey my regulations. They scorned my decrees by violating my Sabbath days and longing for the idols of their ancestors. 
26Ezk 20:25 I gave them over to worthless decrees and regulations that would not lead to life. 
26Ezk 20:26 I let them pollute themselves®Á with the very gifts I had given them, and I allowed them to give their firstborn children as offerings to their gods - so I might devastate them and remind them that I alone am the Lord. / ®ÁOr I gave them worthless decrees and regulations. . . . I polluted them.
26Ezk 20:27 °∞Therefore, son of man, give the people of Israel this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ Your ancestors continued to blaspheme and betray me, 
26Ezk 20:28 for when I brought them into the land I had promised them, they offered sacrifices on every high hill and under every green tree they saw! They roused my fury as they offered up sacrifices to their gods. They brought their perfumes and incense and poured out their liquid offerings to them. 
26Ezk 20:29 I said to them, °ÆWhat is this high place where you are going?°Ø (This kind of pagan shrine has been called Bamah - °Æhigh place°Ø - ever since.)
26Ezk 20:30 °∞Therefore, give the people of Israel this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ Do you plan to pollute yourselves just as your ancestors did? Do you intend to keep prostituting yourselves by worshiping vile images? 
26Ezk 20:31 For when you offer gifts to them and give your little children to be burned as sacrifices®Á, you continue to pollute yourselves with idols to this day. Should I allow you to ask for a message from me, O people of Israel? As surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, I will tell you nothing. / ®ÁOr and make your little children pass through the fire.
26Ezk 20:32 °∞You say, °ÆWe want to be like the nations all around us, who serve idols of wood and stone.°Ø But what you have in mind will never happen. 
26Ezk 20:33 As surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, I will rule over you with an iron fist in great anger and with awesome power. 
26Ezk 20:34 And in anger I will reach out with my strong hand and powerful arm, and I will bring you back®Á from the lands where you are scattered. / ®ÁGreek version reads I will welcome you. Compare 2 Cor 6.17.
26Ezk 20:35 I will bring you into the wilderness of the nations, and there I will judge you face to face. 
26Ezk 20:36 I will judge you there just as I did your ancestors in the wilderness after bringing them out of Egypt, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 20:37 I will examine you carefully and hold you to the terms of the covenant. 
26Ezk 20:38 I will purge you of all those who rebel and revolt against me. I will bring them out of the countries where they are in exile, but they will never enter the land of Israel. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 20:39 °∞As for you, O people of Israel, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Go right ahead and worship your idols, but sooner or later you will obey me and will stop bringing shame on my holy name by worshiping idols. 
26Ezk 20:40 For on my holy mountain, the great mountain of Israel, says the Sovereign Lord, the people of Israel will someday worship me, and I will accept them. There I will require that you bring me all your offerings and choice gifts and sacrifices. 
26Ezk 20:41 When I bring you home from exile, you will be like a pleasing sacrifice to me. And I will display my holiness through you as all the nations watch. 
26Ezk 20:42 Then when I have brought you home to the land I promised with a solemn oath to give to your ancestors, you will know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 20:43 You will look back on all the ways you defiled yourselves and will hate yourselves because of the evil you have done. 
26Ezk 20:44 You will know that I am the Lord, O people of Israel, when I have honored my name by treating you mercifully in spite of your wickedness. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 20:45 ®ÁThen this message came to me from the Lord£∫ / ®ÁVerses 20.45-49 are numbered 21.1-5 in Hebrew text.
26Ezk 20:46 °∞Son of man, turn and face the south®Á and speak out against it; prophesy against the brushlands of the Negev. / ®ÁHebrew toward Teman.
26Ezk 20:47 Tell the southern wilderness, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Hear the word of the Lord! I will set you on fire, and every tree, both green and dry, will be burned. The terrible flames will not be quenched and will scorch everything from south to north. 
26Ezk 20:48 And everyone in the world will see that I, the Lord, have set this fire. It will not be put out.°Ø°±
26Ezk 20:49 Then I said, °∞O Sovereign Lord, they are saying of me, °ÆHe only talks in riddles!°Ø°±
26Ezk 21:1 ®ÁThen this message came to me from the Lord£∫ / ®ÁVerses 21.1-32 are numbered 21.6-37 in Hebrew text.
26Ezk 21:2 °∞Son of man, turn and face Jerusalem and prophesy against Israel and her sanctuaries. 
26Ezk 21:3 Tell her, °ÆThis is what the Lord says£∫ I am your enemy, O Israel, and I am about to unsheath my sword to destroy your people - the righteous and the wicked alike. 
26Ezk 21:4 Yes, I will cut off both the righteous and the wicked! I will draw my sword against everyone in the land from south to north. 
26Ezk 21:5 Everyone in the world will know that I am the Lord. My sword is in my hand, and it will not return to its sheath until its work is finished.°Ø
26Ezk 21:6 °∞Son of man, groan before the people! Groan before them with bitter anguish and a broken heart. 
26Ezk 21:7 When they ask why you are groaning, tell them, °ÆI groan because of the terrifying news I have heard. When it comes true, the boldest heart will melt with fear; all strength will disappear. Every spirit will faint; strong knees will become as weak as water. And the Sovereign Lord says£∫ It is coming! It°Øs on its way!°Ø°±
26Ezk 21:8 Then the Lord said to me, 
26Ezk 21:9 °∞Son of man, give the people this message from the Lord. °∞A sword, a sword is being sharpened and polished.
26Ezk 21:10 It is sharpened for terrible slaughter and polished to flash like lightning! Now will you laugh? Those far stronger than you have fallen beneath its power!®Á / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
26Ezk 21:11 Yes, the sword is now being sharpened and polished; it is being prepared for the executioner.
26Ezk 21:12 °∞Son of man, cry out and wail; pound your thighs in anguish, for that sword will slaughter my people and their leaders - everyone will die!
26Ezk 21:13 It will put them all to the test. What chance do they have?®Á says the Sovereign Lord. / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
26Ezk 21:14 °∞Son of man, prophesy to them and clap your hands. Then take the sword and brandish it twice, even three times, to symbolize the great massacre, the great massacre facing them on every side.
26Ezk 21:15 Let their hearts melt with terror, for the sword glitters at every gate. It flashes like lightning and is polished for slaughter!
26Ezk 21:16 O sword, slash to the right, then slash to the left, wherever you will, wherever you want.
26Ezk 21:17 I, too, will clap my hands, and I will satisfy my fury. I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 21:18 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 21:19 °∞Son of man, make a map and trace two routes on it for the sword of Babylon°Øs king to follow. Put a signpost on the road that comes out of Babylon where the road forks into two - 
26Ezk 21:20 one road going to Ammon and its capital, Rabbah, and the other to Judah and fortified Jerusalem. 
26Ezk 21:21 The king of Babylon now stands at the fork, uncertain whether to attack Jerusalem or Rabbah. He calls his magicians to look for omens. They cast lots by shaking arrows from the quiver. They inspect the livers of animal sacrifices. 
26Ezk 21:22 The omen in his right hand says, °ÆJerusalem!°Ø With battering rams his soldiers will go against the gates, shouting for the kill. They will put up siege towers and build ramps against the walls. 
26Ezk 21:23 The people of Jerusalem will think it is a false omen, because of their treaty with the Babylonians. But the king of Babylon will remind the people of their rebellion. Then he will attack and capture them.
26Ezk 21:24 °∞Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Again and again you remind me of your sin and your guilt. You don°Øt even try to hide it! In everything you do, your sins are obvious for all to see. So now the time of your punishment has come!
26Ezk 21:25 °∞O you corrupt and wicked prince of Israel, your final day of reckoning is here! 
26Ezk 21:26 This is what the Sovereign Lord says. °∞Take off your jeweled crown, for the old order changes. Now the lowly will be exalted, and the mighty will be brought down.
26Ezk 21:27 Destruction! Destruction! I will surely destroy the kingdom. And it will not be restored until the one appears who has the right to judge it. Then I will hand it over to him.
26Ezk 21:28 °∞And now, son of man, prophesy concerning the Ammonites and their mockery. Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord. °∞A sword, a sword is drawn for your slaughter. It is polished to destroy, flashing like lightning!
26Ezk 21:29 Your prophets have given false visions, and your fortune-tellers have told lies. The sword will fall on the necks of the wicked for whom the day of final reckoning has come.
26Ezk 21:30 °∞Now return the sword to its sheath, for in your own country, the land of your birth, I will pass judgment upon you.
26Ezk 21:31 I will pour out my fury on you and blow on you with the fire of my anger. I will hand you over to cruel men who are skilled in destruction.
26Ezk 21:32 You will be fuel for the fire, and your blood will be spilled in your own land. You will be utterly wiped out, your memory lost to history, for I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 22:1 Now this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 22:2 °∞Son of man, are you ready to judge Jerusalem? Are you ready to judge this city of murderers? Publicly denounce her detestable sins, 
26Ezk 22:3 and give her this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ O city of murderers, doomed and damned - city of idols®Á, filthy and foul - / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung; also in 22.4.
26Ezk 22:4 you are guilty because of the blood you have shed. You are defiled because of the idols you have made. Your day of destruction has come! You have reached the end of your years. I will make you an object of mockery throughout the world. 
26Ezk 22:5 O infamous city, filled with confusion, you will be mocked by people far and near.
26Ezk 22:6 °∞Every leader in Israel who lives within your walls is bent on murder. 
26Ezk 22:7 Fathers and mothers are treated with contempt. Foreigners are forced to pay for protection. Orphans and widows are wronged and oppressed among you. 
26Ezk 22:8 You despise my holy things and violate my Sabbath days of rest. 
26Ezk 22:9 People accuse others falsely and send them to their death. You are filled with idol worshipers and people who do obscene things. 
26Ezk 22:10 Men sleep with their fathers°Ø wives and have intercourse with women who are menstruating. 
26Ezk 22:11 Within your walls live men who commit adultery with their neighbors°Ø wives, who defile their daughters-in-law, or who rape their own sisters. 
26Ezk 22:12 There are hired murderers, loan racketeers, and extortioners everywhere. They never even think of me and my commands, says the Sovereign Lord.
26Ezk 22:13 °∞But now I clap my hands in indignation over your dishonest gain and bloodshed. 
26Ezk 22:14 How strong and courageous will you be in my day of reckoning? I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do what I said. 
26Ezk 22:15 I will scatter you among the nations and purge you of your wickedness. 
26Ezk 22:16 And when I have been dishonored among the nations because of you®Á, you will know that I am the Lord.°± / ®ÁOr when you have been dishonored among the nations.
26Ezk 22:17 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 22:18 °∞Son of man, the people of Israel are the worthless slag that remains after silver is smelted. They are the dross that is left over - a useless mixture of copper, tin, iron, and lead. 
26Ezk 22:19 So tell them, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Because you are all worthless slag, I will bring you to my crucible in Jerusalem. 
26Ezk 22:20 Just as copper, iron, lead, and tin are melted down in a furnace, I will melt you down in the heat of my fury. 
26Ezk 22:21 I will gather you together and blow the fire of my anger upon you, 
26Ezk 22:22 and you will melt like silver in fierce heat. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have poured out my fury on you.°Ø°±
26Ezk 22:23 Again a message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 22:24 °∞Son of man, give the people of Israel this message£∫ In the day of my indignation, you will be like a polluted land, a land without rain. 
26Ezk 22:25 Your princes®Á plot conspiracies just as lions stalk their prey. They devour innocent people, seizing treasures and extorting wealth. They make many widows in the land. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads prophets.
26Ezk 22:26 Your priests have violated my instructions and defiled my holy things. They make no distinction between what is holy and what is not. And they do not teach my people the difference between what is ceremonially clean and unclean. They disregard my Sabbath days so that I am dishonored among them. 
26Ezk 22:27 Your leaders are like wolves who tear apart their victims. They actually destroy people°Øs lives for money! 
26Ezk 22:28 And your prophets cover up for them by announcing false visions and making lying predictions. They say, °ÆMy message is from the Sovereign Lord,°Ø when the Lord hasn°Øt spoken a single word to them. 
26Ezk 22:29 Even common people oppress the poor, rob the needy, and deprive foreigners of justice.
26Ezk 22:30 °∞I looked for someone who might rebuild the wall of righteousness that guards the land. I searched for someone to stand in the gap in the wall so I wouldn°Øt have to destroy the land, but I found no one. 
26Ezk 22:31 So now I will pour out my fury on them, consuming them with the fire of my anger. I will heap on their heads the full penalty for all their sins. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 23:1 This message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 23:2 °∞Son of man, once there were two sisters who were daughters of the same mother. 
26Ezk 23:3 They became prostitutes in Egypt. Even as young girls, they allowed men to fondle their breasts. 
26Ezk 23:4 The older girl was named Oholah, and her sister was Oholibah. I married them, and they bore me sons and daughters. I am speaking of Samaria and Jerusalem, for Oholah is Samaria and Oholibah is Jerusalem.
26Ezk 23:5 °∞Then Oholah lusted after other lovers instead of me, and she gave her love to the Assyrian officers. 
26Ezk 23:6 They were all attractive young men, captains and commanders dressed in handsome blue, charioteers driving their horses. 
26Ezk 23:7 And so she prostituted herself with the most desirable men of Assyria, worshiping their idols®Á and defiling herself. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung; also in 23.30, 37, 39, 49.
26Ezk 23:8 For when she left Egypt, she did not leave her spirit of prostitution behind. She was still as lewd as in her youth, when the Egyptians slept with her, fondled her breasts, and used her as a prostitute.
26Ezk 23:9 °∞And so I handed her over to her Assyrian lovers, whom she desired so much. 
26Ezk 23:10 They stripped her, took away her children as their slaves, and then killed her. After she received her punishment, her reputation was known to every woman in the land.
26Ezk 23:11 °∞Yet even though Oholibah saw what had happened to Oholah, her sister, she followed right in her footsteps. And she was even more depraved, abandoning herself to her lust and prostitution. 
26Ezk 23:12 She fawned over all the Assyrian officers - those captains and commanders in handsome uniforms, those charioteers driving their horses - all of them attractive young men. 
26Ezk 23:13 I saw the way she was going, defiling herself just like her older sister.
26Ezk 23:14 °∞Then she carried her prostitution even further. She fell in love with pictures that were painted on a wall - pictures of Babylonian®Á military officers, outfitted in striking red uniforms. / ®ÁOr Chaldean.
26Ezk 23:15 Handsome belts encircled their waists, and flowing turbans crowned their heads. They were dressed like chariot officers from the land of Babylonia®Á. / ®ÁOr Chaldea; also in 23.16.
26Ezk 23:16 When she saw these paintings, she longed to give herself to them, so she sent messengers to Babylonia to invite them to come to her. 
26Ezk 23:17 So they came and committed adultery with her, defiling her in the bed of love. After being defiled, however, she rejected them in disgust.
26Ezk 23:18 °∞In the same way, I became disgusted with Oholibah and rejected her, just as I had rejected her sister, because she flaunted herself before them and gave herself to satisfy their lusts. 
26Ezk 23:19 Yet she turned to even greater prostitution, remembering her youth when she was a prostitute in Egypt. 
26Ezk 23:20 She lusted after lovers with genitals as large as a donkey°Øs and emissions like those of a horse. 
26Ezk 23:21 And so, Oholibah, you relived your former days as a young girl in Egypt, when you first allowed your breasts to be fondled.
26Ezk 23:22 °∞Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will send your lovers against you from every direction - those very nations from which you turned away in disgust. 
26Ezk 23:23 For the Babylonians will come with all the Chaldeans from Pekod and Shoa and Koa. And all the Assyrians will come with them - handsome young captains, commanders, chariot officers, and other high-ranking officers, all riding their horses. 
26Ezk 23:24 They will all come against you from the north®Á with chariots, wagons, and a great army prepared for attack. They will take up positions on every side, surrounding you with men armed with shields and helmets. And I will hand you over to them for punishment so they can do with you as they please. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
26Ezk 23:25 I will turn my jealous anger against you, and they will deal harshly with you. They will cut off your nose and ears, and any survivors will then be slaughtered by the sword. Your children will be taken away as captives, and everything that is left will be burned. 
26Ezk 23:26 They will strip you of your beautiful clothes and jewels. 
26Ezk 23:27 In this way, I will put a stop to the lewdness and prostitution you brought from Egypt. You will never again cast longing eyes on those things or fondly remember your time in Egypt.
26Ezk 23:28 °∞For this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will surely hand you over to your enemies, to those you loathe, those you rejected. 
26Ezk 23:29 They will treat you with hatred and rob you of all you own, leaving you stark naked. The shame of your prostitution will be exposed to all the world. 
26Ezk 23:30 You brought all this on yourself by prostituting yourself to other nations, defiling yourself with all their idols. 
26Ezk 23:31 Because you have followed in your sister°Øs footsteps, I will force you to drink the same cup of terror she drank.
26Ezk 23:32 °∞Yes, this is what the Sovereign Lord says. °∞You will drink from your sister°Øs cup of terror, a cup that is large and deep. It is filled to the brim with scorn and derision.
26Ezk 23:33 Drunkenness and anguish will fill you, for your cup is filled to the brim with distress and desolation, the same cup your sister Samaria drank.
26Ezk 23:34 You will drain that cup of terror to the very bottom. Then you will smash it to pieces and beat your breast in anguish. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!
26Ezk 23:35 °∞And because you have forgotten me and turned your back on me, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ You must bear the consequences of all your lewdness and prostitution.°±
26Ezk 23:36 The Lord said to me, °∞Son of man, you must accuse Oholah and Oholibah of all their detestable sins. 
26Ezk 23:37 They have committed both adultery and murder - adultery by worshiping idols and murder by burning as sacrifices the children they bore to me. 
26Ezk 23:38 Furthermore, they have defiled my Temple and violated my Sabbath day! 
26Ezk 23:39 On the very day that they sacrificed their children to their idols, they boldly came into my Temple to worship! They came in and defiled my house.
26Ezk 23:40 °∞You sisters sent messengers to distant lands to get men. Then when they arrived, you bathed yourselves, painted your eyelids, and put on your finest jewels for them. 
26Ezk 23:41 You sat with them on a beautifully embroidered couch and put my incense and my special oil on a table that was spread before you. 
26Ezk 23:42 From your room came the sound of many men carousing. They were lustful men and drunkards®Á from the wilderness, who put bracelets on your wrists and beautiful crowns on your heads. / ®ÁOr Sabeans.
26Ezk 23:43 Then I said, °ÆIf they really want to have sex with old worn-out prostitutes like these, let them!°Ø 
26Ezk 23:44 And that is what they did. They had sex with Oholah and Oholibah, these shameless prostitutes. 
26Ezk 23:45 But righteous people will judge these sister cities for what they really are - adulterers and murderers.
26Ezk 23:46 °∞Now this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Bring an army against them and hand them over to be terrorized and plundered. 
26Ezk 23:47 For their enemies will stone them and kill them with swords. They will butcher their sons and daughters and burn their homes. 
26Ezk 23:48 In this way, I will put an end to lewdness and idolatry in the land, and my judgment will be a warning to others not to follow their wicked example. 
26Ezk 23:49 You will be fully repaid for all your prostitution - your worship of idols. Yes, you will suffer the full penalty. Then you will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.°±
26Ezk 24:1 On January 15®Á, during the ninth year of King Jehoiachin°Øs captivity, this message came to me from the Lord£∫ / ®ÁHebrew On the tenth day of the tenth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This event occurred on January 15, 588 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.
26Ezk 24:2 °∞Son of man, write down today°Øs date, because on this very day the king of Babylon is beginning his attack against Jerusalem. 
26Ezk 24:3 Then give these rebels an illustration with this message from the Sovereign Lord. °∞Put a pot on the fire, and pour in some water.
26Ezk 24:4 Fill it with choice pieces of meat - the rump and the shoulder and all the most tender cuts.
26Ezk 24:5 Use only the best sheep from the flock, and heap fuel on the fire beneath the pot. Bring the pot to a boil, and cook the bones along with the meat.
26Ezk 24:6 °∞Now this is what the Sovereign Lord says. What sorrow awaits Jerusalem, the city of murderers! She is a cooking pot whose corruption can°Øt be cleaned out. Take the meat out in random order, for no piece is better than another.
26Ezk 24:7 For the blood of her murders is splashed on the rocks. It isn°Øt even spilled on the ground, where the dust could cover it!
26Ezk 24:8 So I will splash her blood on a rock for all to see, an expression of my anger and vengeance against her.
26Ezk 24:9 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says. What sorrow awaits Jerusalem, the city of murderers! I myself will pile up the fuel beneath her.
26Ezk 24:10 Yes, heap on the wood! Let the fire roar to make the pot boil. Cook the meat with many spices, and afterward burn the bones.
26Ezk 24:11 Now set the empty pot on the coals. Heat it red hot! Burn away the filth and corruption.
26Ezk 24:12 But it°Øs hopeless; the corruption can°Øt be cleaned out. So throw it into the fire.
26Ezk 24:13 Your impurity is your lewdness and the corruption of your idolatry. I tried to cleanse you, but you refused. So now you will remain in your filth until my fury against you has been satisfied.
26Ezk 24:14 °∞I, the Lord, have spoken! The time has come, and I won°Øt hold back. I will not change my mind, and I will have no pity on you. You will be judged on the basis of all your wicked actions, says the Sovereign Lord.°±
26Ezk 24:15 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 24:16 °∞Son of man, with one blow I will take away your dearest treasure. Yet you must not show any sorrow at her death. Do not weep; let there be no tears. 
26Ezk 24:17 Groan silently, but let there be no wailing at her grave. Do not uncover your head or take off your sandals. Do not perform the usual rituals of mourning or accept any food brought to you by consoling friends.°±
26Ezk 24:18 So I proclaimed this to the people the next morning, and in the evening my wife died. The next morning I did everything I had been told to do. 
26Ezk 24:19 Then the people asked, °∞What does all this mean? What are you trying to tell us?°±
26Ezk 24:20 So I said to them, °∞A message came to me from the Lord, 
26Ezk 24:21 and I was told to give this message to the people of Israel. This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will defile my Temple, the source of your security and pride, the place your heart delights in. Your sons and daughters whom you left behind in Judea will be slaughtered by the sword. 
26Ezk 24:22 Then you will do as Ezekiel has done. You will not mourn in public or console yourselves by eating the food brought by friends. 
26Ezk 24:23 Your heads will remain covered, and your sandals will not be taken off. You will not mourn or weep, but you will waste away because of your sins. You will mourn privately for all the evil you have done. 
26Ezk 24:24 Ezekiel is an example for you; you will do just as he has done. And when that time comes, you will know that I am the Lord.°±
26Ezk 24:25 Then the Lord said to me, °∞Son of man, on the day I take away their stronghold - their joy and glory, their heart°Øs desire, their dearest treasure - I will also take away their sons and daughters. 
26Ezk 24:26 And on that day a survivor from Jerusalem will come to you in Babylon and tell you what has happened. 
26Ezk 24:27 And when he arrives, your voice will suddenly return so you can talk to him, and you will be a symbol for these people. Then they will know that I am the Lord.°±
26Ezk 25:1 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 25:2 °∞Son of man, turn and face the land of Ammon and prophesy against its people. 
26Ezk 25:3 Give the Ammonites this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ Hear the word of the Sovereign Lord! Because you cheered when my Temple was defiled, mocked Israel in her desolation, and laughed at Judah as she went away into exile, 
26Ezk 25:4 I will allow nomads from the eastern deserts to overrun your country. They will set up their camps among you and pitch their tents on your land. They will harvest all your fruit and drink the milk from your livestock. 
26Ezk 25:5 And I will turn the city of Rabbah into a pasture for camels, and all the land of the Ammonites into a resting place for sheep and goats. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 25:6 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Because you clapped and danced and cheered with glee at the destruction of my people, 
26Ezk 25:7 I will raise my fist of judgment against you. I will give you as plunder to many nations. I will cut you off from being a nation and destroy you completely. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 25:8 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Because the people of Moab have said that Judah is just like all the other nations, 
26Ezk 25:9 I will open up their eastern flank and wipe out their glorious frontier towns - Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim. 
26Ezk 25:10 And I will hand Moab over to nomads from the eastern deserts, just as I handed over Ammon. Yes, the Ammonites will no longer be counted among the nations. 
26Ezk 25:11 In the same way, I will bring my judgment down on the Moabites. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 25:12 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ The people of Edom have sinned greatly by avenging themselves against the people of Judah. 
26Ezk 25:13 Therefore, says the Sovereign Lord, I will raise my fist of judgment against Edom. I will wipe out its people and animals with the sword. I will make a wasteland of everything from Teman to Dedan. 
26Ezk 25:14 I will accomplish this by the hand of my people of Israel. They will carry out my vengeance with anger, and Edom will know that this vengeance is from me. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!
26Ezk 25:15 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ The people of Philistia have acted against Judah out of bitter revenge and long-standing contempt. 
26Ezk 25:16 Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will raise my fist of judgment against the land of the Philistines. I will wipe out the Kerethites and utterly destroy the people who live by the sea. 
26Ezk 25:17 I will execute terrible vengeance against them to punish them for what they have done. And when I have inflicted my revenge, they will know that I am the Lord.°±
26Ezk 26:1 On February 3, during the twelfth year of King Jehoiachin°Øs captivity®Á, this message came to me from the Lord£∫ / ®ÁHebrew In the eleventh year, on the first day of the month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar year. Since an element is missing in the date formula here, scholars have reconstructed this probable reading£∫ In the eleventh [month of the twelfth] year, on the first day of the month. This reading would put this message on February 3, 585 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.
26Ezk 26:2 °∞Son of man, Tyre has rejoiced over the fall of Jerusalem, saying, °ÆHa! She who was the gateway to the rich trade routes to the east has been broken, and I am the heir! Because she has been made desolate, I will become wealthy!°Ø
26Ezk 26:3 °∞Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I am your enemy, O Tyre, and I will bring many nations against you, like the waves of the sea crashing against your shoreline. 
26Ezk 26:4 They will destroy the walls of Tyre and tear down its towers. I will scrape away its soil and make it a bare rock! 
26Ezk 26:5 It will be just a rock in the sea, a place for fishermen to spread their nets, for I have spoken, says the Sovereign Lord. Tyre will become the prey of many nations, 
26Ezk 26:6 and its mainland villages will be destroyed by the sword. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 26:7 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ From the north I will bring King Nebuchadnezzar®Á of Babylon against Tyre. He is king of kings and brings his horses, chariots, charioteers, and great army. / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar.
26Ezk 26:8 First he will destroy your mainland villages. Then he will attack you by building a siege wall, constructing a ramp, and raising a roof of shields against you. 
26Ezk 26:9 He will pound your walls with battering rams and demolish your towers with sledgehammers. 
26Ezk 26:10 The hooves of his horses will choke the city with dust, and the noise of the charioteers and chariot wheels will shake your walls as they storm through your broken gates. 
26Ezk 26:11 His horsemen will trample through every street in the city. They will butcher your people, and your strong pillars will topple.
26Ezk 26:12 °∞They will plunder all your riches and merchandise and break down your walls. They will destroy your lovely homes and dump your stones and timbers and even your dust into the sea. 
26Ezk 26:13 I will stop the music of your songs. No more will the sound of harps be heard among your people. 
26Ezk 26:14 I will make your island a bare rock, a place for fishermen to spread their nets. You will never be rebuilt, for I, the Lord, have spoken. Yes, the Sovereign Lord has spoken!
26Ezk 26:15 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says to Tyre£∫ The whole coastline will tremble at the sound of your fall, as the screams of the wounded echo in the continuing slaughter. 
26Ezk 26:16 All the seaport rulers will step down from their thrones and take off their royal robes and beautiful clothing. They will sit on the ground trembling with horror at your destruction. 
26Ezk 26:17 Then they will wail for you, singing this funeral song£∫ °∞O famous island city, once ruler of the sea, how you have been destroyed! Your people, with their naval power, once spread fear around the world.
26Ezk 26:18 Now the coastlands tremble at your fall. The islands are dismayed as you disappear.
26Ezk 26:19 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will make Tyre an uninhabited ruin, like many others. I will bury you beneath the terrible waves of enemy attack. Great seas will swallow you. 
26Ezk 26:20 I will send you to the pit to join those who descended there long ago. Your city will lie in ruins, buried beneath the earth, like those in the pit who have entered the world of the dead. You will have no place of respect here in the land of the living. 
26Ezk 26:21 I will bring you to a terrible end, and you will exist no more. You will be looked for, but you will never again be found. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 27:1 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 27:2 °∞Son of man, sing a funeral song for Tyre, 
26Ezk 27:3 that mighty gateway to the sea, the trading center of the world. Give Tyre this message from the Sovereign Lord. °∞You boasted, O Tyre, °ÆMy beauty is perfect!°Ø
26Ezk 27:4 You extended your boundaries into the sea. Your builders made your beauty perfect.
26Ezk 27:5 You were like a great ship built of the finest cypress from Senir®Á. They took a cedar from Lebanon to make a mast for you. / ®ÁOr Hermon.
26Ezk 27:6 They carved your oars from the oaks of Bashan. Your deck of pine from the coasts of Cyprus®Á was inlaid with ivory. / ®ÁHebrew Kittim.
26Ezk 27:7 Your sails were made of Egypt°Øs finest linen, and they flew as a banner above you. You stood beneath blue and purple awnings made bright with dyes from the coasts of Elishah.
26Ezk 27:8 Your oarsmen came from Sidon and Arvad; your helmsmen were skilled men from Tyre itself.
26Ezk 27:9 Wise old craftsmen from Gebal did the caulking. Ships from every land came with goods to barter for your trade.
26Ezk 27:10 °∞Men from distant Persia, Lydia, and Libya®Á served in your great army. They hung their shields and helmets on your walls, giving you great honor. / ®ÁHebrew Paras, Lud, and Put.
26Ezk 27:11 Men from Arvad and Helech stood on your walls. Your towers were manned by men from Gammad. Their shields hung on your walls, completing your beauty.
26Ezk 27:12 °∞Tarshish sent merchants to buy your wares in exchange for silver, iron, tin, and lead. 
26Ezk 27:13 Merchants from Greece®Á, Tubal, and Meshech brought slaves and articles of bronze to trade with you. / ®ÁHebrew Javan.
26Ezk 27:14 °∞From Togarmah came riding horses, chariot horses, and mules, all in exchange for your goods. 
26Ezk 27:15 Merchants came to you from Dedan®Á. Numerous coastlands were your captive markets; they brought payment in ivory tusks and ebony wood. / ®ÁGreek version reads Rhodes.

26Ezk 27:17 Judah and Israel traded for your wares, offering wheat from Minnith, figs®Á, honey, olive oil, and balm. / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
26Ezk 27:18 °∞Damascus sent merchants to buy your rich variety of goods, bringing wine from Helbon and white wool from Zahar. 
26Ezk 27:19 Greeks from Uzal®Á came to trade for your merchandise. Wrought iron, cassia, and fragrant calamus were bartered for your wares. / ®ÁHebrew Vedan and Javan from Uzal. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
26Ezk 27:20 °∞Dedan sent merchants to trade their expensive saddle blankets with you.

26Ezk 27:23 °∞Haran, Canneh, Eden, Sheba, Asshur, and Kilmad came with their merchandise, too. 
26Ezk 27:24 They brought choice fabrics to trade - blue cloth, embroidery, and multicolored carpets rolled up and bound with cords. 
26Ezk 27:25 The ships of Tarshish were your ocean caravans. Your island warehouse was filled to the brim!
26Ezk 27:26 °∞But look! Your oarsmen have taken you into stormy seas! A mighty eastern gale has wrecked you in the heart of the sea!
26Ezk 27:27 Everything is lost - your riches and wares, your sailors and pilots, your ship builders, merchants, and warriors. On the day of your ruin, everyone on board sinks into the depths of the sea.
26Ezk 27:28 Your cities by the sea tremble as your pilots cry out in terror.
26Ezk 27:29 All the oarsmen abandon their ships; the sailors and pilots on shore come to stand on the beach.
26Ezk 27:30 They cry aloud over you and weep bitterly. They throw dust on their heads and roll in ashes.
26Ezk 27:31 They shave their heads in grief for you and dress themselves in burlap. They weep for you with bitter anguish and deep mourning.
26Ezk 27:32 As they wail and mourn over you, they sing this sad funeral song. °ÆWas there ever such a city as Tyre, now silent at the bottom of the sea?
26Ezk 27:33 The merchandise you traded satisfied the desires of many nations. Kings at the ends of the earth were enriched by your trade.
26Ezk 27:34 Now you are a wrecked ship, broken at the bottom of the sea. All your merchandise and crew have gone down with you.
26Ezk 27:35 All who live along the coastlands are appalled at your terrible fate. Their kings are filled with horror and look on with twisted faces.
26Ezk 27:36 The merchants among the nations shake their heads at the sight of you®Á, for you have come to a horrible end and will exist no more.°Ø°± / ®ÁHebrew hiss at you.
26Ezk 28:1 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 28:2 °∞Son of man, give the prince of Tyre this message from the Sovereign Lord. °∞In your great pride you claim, °ÆI am a god! I sit on a divine throne in the heart of the sea.°Ø But you are only a man and not a god, though you boast that you are a god.
26Ezk 28:3 You regard yourself as wiser than Daniel and think no secret is hidden from you.
26Ezk 28:4 With your wisdom and understanding you have amassed great wealth - gold and silver for your treasuries.
26Ezk 28:5 Yes, your wisdom has made you very rich, and your riches have made you very proud.
26Ezk 28:6 °∞Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says. Because you think you are as wise as a god,
26Ezk 28:7 I will now bring against you a foreign army, the terror of the nations. They will draw their swords against your marvelous wisdom and defile your splendor!
26Ezk 28:8 They will bring you down to the pit, and you will die in the heart of the sea, pierced with many wounds.
26Ezk 28:9 Will you then boast, °ÆI am a god!°Ø to those who kill you? To them you will be no god but merely a man!
26Ezk 28:10 You will die like an outcast®Á at the hands of foreigners. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°± / ®ÁHebrew will die the death of the uncircumcised.
26Ezk 28:11 Then this further message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 28:12 °∞Son of man, sing this funeral song for the king of Tyre. Give him this message from the Sovereign Lord. °∞You were the model of perfection, full of wisdom and exquisite in beauty.
26Ezk 28:13 You were in Eden, the garden of God. Your clothing was adorned with every precious stone®Á - red carnelian, pale-green peridot, white moonstone, blue-green beryl, onyx, green jasper, blue lapis lazuli, turquoise, and emerald - all beautifully crafted for you and set in the finest gold. They were given to you on the day you were created. / ®ÁThe identification of some of these gemstones is uncertain.
26Ezk 28:14 I ordained and anointed you as the mighty angelic guardian®Á. You had access to the holy mountain of God and walked among the stones of fire. / ®ÁHebrew guardian cherub; similarly in 28.16.
26Ezk 28:15 °∞You were blameless in all you did from the day you were created until the day evil was found in you.
26Ezk 28:16 Your rich commerce led you to violence, and you sinned. So I banished you in disgrace from the mountain of God. I expelled you, O mighty guardian, from your place among the stones of fire.
26Ezk 28:17 Your heart was filled with pride because of all your beauty. Your wisdom was corrupted by your love of splendor. So I threw you to the ground and exposed you to the curious gaze of kings.
26Ezk 28:18 You defiled your sanctuaries with your many sins and your dishonest trade. So I brought fire out from within you, and it consumed you. I reduced you to ashes on the ground in the sight of all who were watching.
26Ezk 28:19 All who knew you are appalled at your fate. You have come to a terrible end, and you will exist no more.°±
26Ezk 28:20 Then another message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 28:21 °∞Son of man, turn and face the city of Sidon and prophesy against it. 
26Ezk 28:22 Give the people of Sidon this message from the Sovereign Lord. °∞I am your enemy, O Sidon, and I will reveal my glory by what I do to you. When I bring judgment against you and reveal my holiness among you, everyone watching will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 28:23 I will send a plague against you, and blood will be spilled in your streets. The attack will come from every direction, and your people will lie slaughtered within your walls. Then everyone will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 28:24 No longer will Israel°Øs scornful neighbors prick and tear at her like briers and thorns. For then they will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.
26Ezk 28:25 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ The people of Israel will again live in their own land, the land I gave my servant Jacob. For I will gather them from the distant lands where I have scattered them. I will reveal to the nations of the world my holiness among my people. 
26Ezk 28:26 They will live safely in Israel and build homes and plant vineyards. And when I punish the neighboring nations that treated them with contempt, they will know that I am the Lord their God.°±
26Ezk 29:1 On January 7®Á, during the tenth year of King Jehoiachin°Øs captivity, this message came to me from the Lord£∫ / ®ÁHebrew On the twelfth day of the tenth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This event occurred on January 7, 587 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.
26Ezk 29:2 °∞Son of man, turn and face Egypt and prophesy against Pharaoh the king and all the people of Egypt. 
26Ezk 29:3 Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord. °∞I am your enemy, O Pharaoh, king of Egypt - you great monster, lurking in the streams of the Nile. For you have said, °ÆThe Nile River is mine; I made it for myself.°Ø
26Ezk 29:4 I will put hooks in your jaws and drag you out on the land with fish sticking to your scales.
26Ezk 29:5 I will leave you and all your fish stranded in the wilderness to die. You will lie unburied on the open ground, for I have given you as food to the wild animals and birds.
26Ezk 29:6 All the people of Egypt will know that I am the Lord, for to Israel you were just a staff made of reeds.
26Ezk 29:7 When Israel leaned on you, you splintered and broke and stabbed her in the armpit. When she put her weight on you, you gave way, and her back was thrown out of joint.
26Ezk 29:8 °∞Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will bring an army against you, O Egypt, and destroy both people and animals. 
26Ezk 29:9 The land of Egypt will become a desolate wasteland, and the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord. °∞Because you said, °ÆThe Nile River is mine; I made it,°Ø 
26Ezk 29:10 I am now the enemy of both you and your river. I will make the land of Egypt a totally desolate wasteland, from Migdol to Aswan, as far south as the border of Ethiopia®Á. / ®ÁHebrew from Migdol to Syene as far as the border of Cush.
26Ezk 29:11 For forty years not a soul will pass that way, neither people nor animals. It will be completely uninhabited. 
26Ezk 29:12 I will make Egypt desolate, and it will be surrounded by other desolate nations. Its cities will be empty and desolate for forty years, surrounded by other ruined cities. I will scatter the Egyptians to distant lands.
26Ezk 29:13 °∞But this is what the Sovereign Lord also says£∫ At the end of the forty years I will bring the Egyptians home again from the nations to which they have been scattered. 
26Ezk 29:14 I will restore the prosperity of Egypt and bring its people back to the land of Pathros in southern Egypt from which they came. But Egypt will remain an unimportant, minor kingdom. 
26Ezk 29:15 It will be the lowliest of all the nations, never again great enough to rise above its neighbors.
26Ezk 29:16 °∞Then Israel will no longer be tempted to trust in Egypt for help. Egypt°Øs shattered condition will remind Israel of how sinful she was to trust Egypt in earlier days. Then Israel will know that I am the Sovereign Lord.°±
26Ezk 29:17 On April 26, the first day of the new year®Á, during the twenty-seventh year of King Jehoiachin°Øs captivity, this message came to me from the Lord£∫ / ®ÁHebrew On the first day of the first month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This event occurred on April 26, 571 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.
26Ezk 29:18 °∞Son of man, the army of King Nebuchadnezzar®Á of Babylon fought so hard against Tyre that the warriors°Ø heads were rubbed bare and their shoulders were raw and blistered. Yet Nebuchadnezzar and his army won no plunder to compensate them for all their work. / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar; also in 29.19.
26Ezk 29:19 Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will give the land of Egypt to Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon. He will carry off its wealth, plundering everything it has so he can pay his army. 
26Ezk 29:20 Yes, I have given him the land of Egypt as a reward for his work, says the Sovereign Lord, because he was working for me when he destroyed Tyre.
26Ezk 29:21 °∞And the day will come when I will cause the ancient glory of Israel to revive®Á, and then, Ezekiel, your words will be respected. Then they will know that I am the Lord.°± / ®ÁHebrew I will cause a horn to sprout for the house of Israel.
26Ezk 30:1 This is another message that came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 30:2 °∞Son of man, prophesy and give this message from the Sovereign Lord. °∞Weep and wail for that day,
26Ezk 30:3 for the terrible day is almost here - the day of the Lord! It is a day of clouds and gloom, a day of despair for the nations.
26Ezk 30:4 A sword will come against Egypt, and those who are slaughtered will cover the ground. Its wealth will be carried away and its foundations destroyed. The land of Ethiopia®Á will be ravished. / ®ÁHebrew Cush; similarly in 30.9.
26Ezk 30:5 Ethiopia, Libya, Lydia, all Arabia®Á, and all their other allies will be destroyed in that war. / ®ÁHebrew Cush, Put, Lud, all Arabia, Cub. Cub is otherwise unknown and may be another spelling for Lub (Libya).
26Ezk 30:6 °∞For this is what the Lord says. All of Egypt°Øs allies will fall, and the pride of her power will end. From Migdol to Aswan®Á they will be slaughtered by the sword, says the Sovereign Lord. / ®ÁHebrew to Syene.
26Ezk 30:7 Egypt will be desolate, surrounded by desolate nations, and its cities will be in ruins, surrounded by other ruined cities.
26Ezk 30:8 And the people of Egypt will know that I am the Lord when I have set Egypt on fire and destroyed all their allies.
26Ezk 30:9 At that time I will send swift messengers in ships to terrify the complacent Ethiopians. Great panic will come upon them on that day of Egypt°Øs certain destruction. Watch for it! It is sure to come!
26Ezk 30:10 °∞For this is what the Sovereign Lord says. By the power of King Nebuchadnezzar®Á of Babylon, I will destroy the hordes of Egypt. / ®ÁHebrew Nebuchadrezzar, a variant spelling of Nebuchadnezzar.
26Ezk 30:11 He and his armies - the most ruthless of all - will be sent to demolish the land. They will make war against Egypt until slaughtered Egyptians cover the ground.
26Ezk 30:12 I will dry up the Nile River and sell the land to wicked men. I will destroy the land of Egypt and everything in it by the hands of foreigners. I, the Lord, have spoken!
26Ezk 30:13 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says. I will smash the idols®Á of Egypt and the images at Memphis®Ë. There will be no rulers left in Egypt; terror will sweep the land. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung. ®ËHebrew Noph; also in 30.16.
26Ezk 30:14 I will destroy southern Egypt®Á, set fire to Zoan, and bring judgment against Thebes®Ë. / ®ÁHebrew Pathros. ®ËHebrew No; also in 30.15, 16.
26Ezk 30:15 I will pour out my fury on Pelusium®Á, the strongest fortress of Egypt, and I will stamp out the hordes of Thebes. / ®ÁHebrew Sin; also in 30.16.
26Ezk 30:16 Yes, I will set fire to all Egypt! Pelusium will be racked with pain; Thebes will be torn apart; Memphis will live in constant terror.
26Ezk 30:17 The young men of Heliopolis and Bubastis®Á will die in battle, and the women®Ë will be taken away as slaves. / ®ÁHebrew of Awen and Pi-beseth. ®ËOr and her cities.
26Ezk 30:18 When I come to break the proud strength of Egypt, it will be a dark day for Tahpanhes, too. A dark cloud will cover Tahpanhes, and its daughters will be led away as captives.
26Ezk 30:19 And so I will greatly punish Egypt, and they will know that I am the Lord.°±
26Ezk 30:20 On April 29®Á, during the eleventh year of King Jehoiachin°Øs captivity, this message came to me from the Lord£∫ / ®ÁHebrew On the seventh day of the first month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This event occurred on April 29, 587 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.
26Ezk 30:21 °∞Son of man, I have broken the arm of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt. His arm has not been put in a cast so that it may heal. Neither has it been bound up with a splint to make it strong enough to hold a sword. 
26Ezk 30:22 Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I am the enemy of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt! I will break both of his arms - the good arm along with the broken one - and I will make his sword clatter to the ground. 
26Ezk 30:23 I will scatter the Egyptians to many lands throughout the world. 
26Ezk 30:24 I will strengthen the arms of Babylon°Øs king and put my sword in his hand. But I will break the arms of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he will lie there mortally wounded, groaning in pain. 
26Ezk 30:25 I will strengthen the arms of the king of Babylon, while the arms of Pharaoh fall useless to his sides. And when I put my sword in the hand of Babylon°Øs king and he brings it against the land of Egypt, Egypt will know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 30:26 I will scatter the Egyptians among the nations, dispersing them throughout the earth. Then they will know that I am the Lord.°±
26Ezk 31:1 On June 21®Á, during the eleventh year of King Jehoiachin°Øs captivity, this message came to me from the Lord£∫ / ®ÁHebrew On the first day of the third month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This event occurred on June 21, 587 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.
26Ezk 31:2 °∞Son of man, give this message to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and all his hordes. °∞To whom would you compare your greatness?
26Ezk 31:3 You are like mighty Assyria, which was once like a cedar of Lebanon, with beautiful branches that cast deep forest shade and with its top high among the clouds.
26Ezk 31:4 Deep springs watered it and helped it to grow tall and luxuriant. The water flowed around it like a river, streaming to all the trees nearby.
26Ezk 31:5 This great tree towered high, higher than all the other trees around it. It prospered and grew long thick branches because of all the water at its roots.
26Ezk 31:6 The birds nested in its branches, and in its shade all the wild animals gave birth. All the great nations of the world lived in its shadow.
26Ezk 31:7 It was strong and beautiful, with wide-spreading branches, for its roots went deep into abundant water.
26Ezk 31:8 No other cedar in the garden of God could rival it. No cypress had branches to equal it; no plane tree had boughs to compare. No tree in the garden of God came close to it in beauty.
26Ezk 31:9 Because I made this tree so beautiful, and gave it such magnificent foliage, it was the envy of all the other trees of Eden, the garden of God.
26Ezk 31:10 °∞Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Because Egypt®Á became proud and arrogant, and because it set itself so high above the others, with its top reaching to the clouds, / ®ÁHebrew you.
26Ezk 31:11 I will hand it over to a mighty nation that will destroy it as its wickedness deserves. I have already discarded it. 
26Ezk 31:12 A foreign army - the terror of the nations - has cut it down and left it fallen on the ground. Its branches are scattered across the mountains and valleys and ravines of the land. All those who lived in its shadow have gone away and left it lying there.
26Ezk 31:13 °∞The birds roost on its fallen trunk, and the wild animals lie among its branches.
26Ezk 31:14 Let the tree of no other nation proudly exult in its own prosperity, though it be higher than the clouds and it be watered from the depths. For all are doomed to die, to go down to the depths of the earth. They will land in the pit along with everyone else on earth.
26Ezk 31:15 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ When Assyria went down to the grave®Á, I made the deep springs mourn. I stopped its rivers and dried up its abundant water. I clothed Lebanon in black and caused the trees of the field to wilt. / ®ÁHebrew to Sheol; also in 31.16, 17.
26Ezk 31:16 I made the nations shake with fear at the sound of its fall, for I sent it down to the grave with all the others who descend to the pit. And all the other proud trees of Eden, the most beautiful and the best of Lebanon, the ones whose roots went deep into the water, took comfort to find it there with them in the depths of the earth. 
26Ezk 31:17 Its allies, too, were all destroyed and had passed away. They had gone down to the grave - all those nations that had lived in its shade.
26Ezk 31:18 °∞O Egypt, to which of the trees of Eden will you compare your strength and glory? You, too, will be brought down to the depths with all these other nations. You will lie there among the outcasts®Á who have died by the sword. This will be the fate of Pharaoh and all his hordes. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°± / ®ÁHebrew among the uncircumcised.
26Ezk 32:1 On March 3®Á, during the twelfth year of King Jehoiachin°Øs captivity, this message came to me from the Lord£∫ / ®ÁHebrew On the first day of the twelfth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This event occurred on March 3, 585 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.
26Ezk 32:2 °∞Son of man, mourn for Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and give him this message. °∞You think of yourself as a strong young lion among the nations, but you are really just a sea monster, heaving around in your own rivers, stirring up mud with your feet.
26Ezk 32:3 Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says. I will send many people to catch you in my net and haul you out of the water.
26Ezk 32:4 I will leave you stranded on the land to die. All the birds of the heavens will land on you, and the wild animals of the whole earth will gorge themselves on you.
26Ezk 32:5 I will scatter your flesh on the hills and fill the valleys with your bones.
26Ezk 32:6 I will drench the earth with your gushing blood all the way to the mountains, filling the ravines to the brim.
26Ezk 32:7 When I blot you out, I will veil the heavens and darken the stars. I will cover the sun with a cloud, and the moon will not give you its light.
26Ezk 32:8 I will darken the bright stars overhead and cover your land in darkness. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!
26Ezk 32:9 °∞I will disturb many hearts when I bring news of your downfall to distant nations you have never seen. 
26Ezk 32:10 Yes, I will shock many lands, and their kings will be terrified at your fate. They will shudder in fear for their lives as I brandish my sword before them on the day of your fall. 
26Ezk 32:11 For this is what the Sovereign Lord says. °∞The sword of the king of Babylon will come against you.
26Ezk 32:12 I will destroy your hordes with the swords of mighty warriors - the terror of the nations. They will shatter the pride of Egypt, and all its hordes will be destroyed.
26Ezk 32:13 I will destroy all your flocks and herds that graze beside the streams. Never again will people or animals muddy those waters with their feet.
26Ezk 32:14 Then I will let the waters of Egypt become calm again, and they will flow as smoothly as olive oil, says the Sovereign Lord.
26Ezk 32:15 And when I destroy Egypt and strip you of everything you own and strike down all your people, then you will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 32:16 Yes, this is the funeral song they will sing for Egypt. Let all the nations mourn. Let them mourn for Egypt and its hordes. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 32:17 On March 17®Á, during the twelfth year, another message came to me from the Lord£∫ / ®ÁHebrew On the fifteenth day of the month, presumably in the twelfth month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar (see 32.1). This would put this message at the end of King Jehoiachin°Øs twelfth year of captivity, on March 17, 585 b.c.; also see note on 1.1. Greek version reads On the fifteenth day of the first month, which would put this message on April 27, 586 b.c., at the beginning of Jehoiachin°Øs twelfth year.
26Ezk 32:18 °∞Son of man, weep for the hordes of Egypt and for the other mighty nations®Á. For I will send them down to the world below in company with those who descend to the pit. / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
26Ezk 32:19 Say to them, °ÆO Egypt, are you lovelier than the other nations? No! So go down to the pit and lie there among the outcasts®Á.°Ø / ®ÁHebrew the uncircumcised; also in 32.21, 24, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30, 32.
26Ezk 32:20 The Egyptians will fall with the many who have died by the sword, for the sword is drawn against them. Egypt and its hordes will be dragged away to their judgment. 
26Ezk 32:21 Down in the grave®Á mighty leaders will mockingly welcome Egypt and its allies, saying, °ÆThey have come down; they lie among the outcasts, hordes slaughtered by the sword.°Ø / ®ÁHebrew in Sheol.
26Ezk 32:22 °∞Assyria lies there surrounded by the graves of its army, those who were slaughtered by the sword. 
26Ezk 32:23 Their graves are in the depths of the pit, and they are surrounded by their allies. They struck terror in the hearts of people everywhere, but now they have been slaughtered by the sword.
26Ezk 32:24 °∞Elam lies there surrounded by the graves of all its hordes, those who were slaughtered by the sword. They struck terror in the hearts of people everywhere, but now they have descended as outcasts to the world below. Now they lie in the pit and share the shame of those who have gone before them. 
26Ezk 32:25 They have a resting place among the slaughtered, surrounded by the graves of all their hordes. Yes, they terrorized the nations while they lived, but now they lie in shame with others in the pit, all of them outcasts, slaughtered by the sword.
26Ezk 32:26 °∞Meshech and Tubal are there, surrounded by the graves of all their hordes. They once struck terror in the hearts of people everywhere. But now they are outcasts, all slaughtered by the sword. 
26Ezk 32:27 They are not buried in honor like their fallen heroes, who went down to the grave®Á with their weapons - their shields covering their bodies®Ë and their swords beneath their heads. Their guilt rests upon them because they brought terror to everyone while they were still alive. / ®ÁHebrew to Sheol. ®ËThe meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
26Ezk 32:28 °∞You too, Egypt, will lie crushed and broken among the outcasts, all slaughtered by the sword.
26Ezk 32:29 °∞Edom is there with its kings and princes. Mighty as they were, they also lie among those slaughtered by the sword, with the outcasts who have gone down to the pit.
26Ezk 32:30 °∞All the princes of the north and the Sidonians are there with others who have died. Once a terror, they have been put to shame. They lie there as outcasts with others who were slaughtered by the sword. They share the shame of all who have descended to the pit.
26Ezk 32:31 °∞When Pharaoh and his entire army arrive, he will take comfort that he is not alone in having his hordes killed, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 32:32 Although I have caused his terror to fall upon all the living, Pharaoh and his hordes will lie there among the outcasts who were slaughtered by the sword. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 33:1 Once again a message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 33:2 °∞Son of man, give your people this message£∫ °ÆWhen I bring an army against a country, the people of that land choose one of their own to be a watchman. 
26Ezk 33:3 When the watchman sees the enemy coming, he sounds the alarm to warn the people. 
26Ezk 33:4 Then if those who hear the alarm refuse to take action, it is their own fault if they die. 
26Ezk 33:5 They heard the alarm but ignored it, so the responsibility is theirs. If they had listened to the warning, they could have saved their lives. 
26Ezk 33:6 But if the watchman sees the enemy coming and doesn°Øt sound the alarm to warn the people, he is responsible for their captivity. They will die in their sins, but I will hold the watchman responsible for their deaths.°Ø
26Ezk 33:7 °∞Now, son of man, I am making you a watchman for the people of Israel. Therefore, listen to what I say and warn them for me. 
26Ezk 33:8 If I announce that some wicked people are sure to die and you fail to tell them to change their ways, then they will die in their sins, and I will hold you responsible for their deaths. 
26Ezk 33:9 But if you warn them to repent and they don°Øt repent, they will die in their sins, but you will have saved yourself.
26Ezk 33:10 °∞Son of man, give the people of Israel this message£∫ You are saying, °ÆOur sins are heavy upon us; we are wasting away! How can we survive?°Ø 
26Ezk 33:11 As surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, I take no pleasure in the death of wicked people. I only want them to turn from their wicked ways so they can live. Turn! Turn from your wickedness, O people of Israel! Why should you die?
26Ezk 33:12 °∞Son of man, give your people this message£∫ The righteous behavior of righteous people will not save them if they turn to sin, nor will the wicked behavior of wicked people destroy them if they repent and turn from their sins. 
26Ezk 33:13 When I tell righteous people that they will live, but then they sin, expecting their past righteousness to save them, then none of their righteous acts will be remembered. I will destroy them for their sins. 
26Ezk 33:14 And suppose I tell some wicked people that they will surely die, but then they turn from their sins and do what is just and right. 
26Ezk 33:15 For instance, they might give back a debtor°Øs security, return what they have stolen, and obey my life-giving laws, no longer doing what is evil. If they do this, then they will surely live and not die. 
26Ezk 33:16 None of their past sins will be brought up again, for they have done what is just and right, and they will surely live.
26Ezk 33:17 °∞Your people are saying, °ÆThe Lord isn°Øt doing what°Øs right,°Ø but it is they who are not doing what°Øs right. 
26Ezk 33:18 For again I say, when righteous people turn away from their righteous behavior and turn to evil, they will die. 
26Ezk 33:19 But if wicked people turn from their wickedness and do what is just and right, they will live. 
26Ezk 33:20 O people of Israel, you are saying, °ÆThe Lord isn°Øt doing what°Øs right.°Ø But I judge each of you according to your deeds.°±
26Ezk 33:21 On January 8®Á, during the twelfth year of our captivity, a survivor from Jerusalem came to me and said, °∞The city has fallen!°± / ®ÁHebrew On the fifth day of the tenth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This event occurred on January 8, 585 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.
26Ezk 33:22 The previous evening the Lord had taken hold of me and given me back my voice. So I was able to speak when this man arrived the next morning.
26Ezk 33:23 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 33:24 °∞Son of man, the scattered remnants of Judah living among the ruined cities keep saying, °ÆAbraham was only one man, yet he gained possession of the entire land. We are many; surely the land has been given to us as a possession.°Ø 
26Ezk 33:25 So tell these people, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ You eat meat with blood in it, you worship idols®Á, and you murder the innocent. Do you really think the land should be yours? / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung.
26Ezk 33:26 Murderers! Idolaters! Adulterers! Should the land belong to you?°Ø
26Ezk 33:27 °∞Say to them, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ As surely as I live, those living in the ruins will die by the sword. And I will send wild animals to eat those living in the open fields. Those hiding in the forts and caves will die of disease. 
26Ezk 33:28 I will completely destroy the land and demolish her pride. Her arrogant power will come to an end. The mountains of Israel will be so desolate that no one will even travel through them. 
26Ezk 33:29 When I have completely destroyed the land because of their detestable sins, then they will know that I am the Lord.°Ø
26Ezk 33:30 °∞Son of man, your people talk about you in their houses and whisper about you at the doors. They say to each other, °ÆCome on, let°Øs go hear the prophet tell us what the Lord is saying!°Ø 
26Ezk 33:31 So my people come pretending to be sincere and sit before you. They listen to your words, but they have no intention of doing what you say. Their mouths are full of lustful words, and their hearts seek only after money. 
26Ezk 33:32 You are very entertaining to them, like someone who sings love songs with a beautiful voice or plays fine music on an instrument. They hear what you say, but they don°Øt act on it! 
26Ezk 33:33 But when all these terrible things happen to them - as they certainly will - then they will know a prophet has been among them.°±
26Ezk 34:1 Then this message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 34:2 °∞Son of man, prophesy against the shepherds, the leaders of Israel. Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ What sorrow awaits you shepherds who feed yourselves instead of your flocks. Shouldn°Øt shepherds feed their sheep? 
26Ezk 34:3 You drink the milk, wear the wool, and butcher the best animals, but you let your flocks starve. 
26Ezk 34:4 You have not taken care of the weak. You have not tended the sick or bound up the injured. You have not gone looking for those who have wandered away and are lost. Instead, you have ruled them with harshness and cruelty. 
26Ezk 34:5 So my sheep have been scattered without a shepherd, and they are easy prey for any wild animal. 
26Ezk 34:6 They have wandered through all the mountains and all the hills, across the face of the earth, yet no one has gone to search for them.
26Ezk 34:7 °∞Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 34:8 As surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, you abandoned my flock and left them to be attacked by every wild animal. And though you were my shepherds, you didn°Øt search for my sheep when they were lost. You took care of yourselves and left the sheep to starve. 
26Ezk 34:9 Therefore, you shepherds, hear the word of the Lord. 
26Ezk 34:10 This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I now consider these shepherds my enemies, and I will hold them responsible for what has happened to my flock. I will take away their right to feed the flock, and I will stop them from feeding themselves. I will rescue my flock from their mouths; the sheep will no longer be their prey.
26Ezk 34:11 °∞For this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I myself will search and find my sheep. 
26Ezk 34:12 I will be like a shepherd looking for his scattered flock. I will find my sheep and rescue them from all the places where they were scattered on that dark and cloudy day. 
26Ezk 34:13 I will bring them back home to their own land of Israel from among the peoples and nations. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel and by the rivers and in all the places where people live. 
26Ezk 34:14 Yes, I will give them good pastureland on the high hills of Israel. There they will lie down in pleasant places and feed in the lush pastures of the hills. 
26Ezk 34:15 I myself will tend my sheep and give them a place to lie down in peace, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 34:16 I will search for my lost ones who strayed away, and I will bring them safely home again. I will bandage the injured and strengthen the weak. But I will destroy those who are fat and powerful. I will feed them, yes - feed them justice!
26Ezk 34:17 °∞And as for you, my flock, this is what the Sovereign Lord says to his people£∫ I will judge between one animal of the flock and another, separating the sheep from the goats. 
26Ezk 34:18 Isn°Øt it enough for you to keep the best of the pastures for yourselves? Must you also trample down the rest? Isn°Øt it enough for you to drink clear water for yourselves? Must you also muddy the rest with your feet? 
26Ezk 34:19 Why must my flock eat what you have trampled down and drink water you have fouled?
26Ezk 34:20 °∞Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will surely judge between the fat sheep and the scrawny sheep. 
26Ezk 34:21 For you fat sheep pushed and butted and crowded my sick and hungry flock until you scattered them to distant lands. 
26Ezk 34:22 So I will rescue my flock, and they will no longer be abused. I will judge between one animal of the flock and another. 
26Ezk 34:23 And I will set over them one shepherd, my servant David. He will feed them and be a shepherd to them. 
26Ezk 34:24 And I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David will be a prince among my people. I, the Lord, have spoken!
26Ezk 34:25 °∞I will make a covenant of peace with my people and drive away the dangerous animals from the land. Then they will be able to camp safely in the wildest places and sleep in the woods without fear. 
26Ezk 34:26 I will bless my people and their homes around my holy hill. And in the proper season I will send the showers they need. There will be showers of blessing. 
26Ezk 34:27 The orchards and fields of my people will yield bumper crops, and everyone will live in safety. When I have broken their chains of slavery and rescued them from those who enslaved them, then they will know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 34:28 They will no longer be prey for other nations, and wild animals will no longer devour them. They will live in safety, and no one will frighten them.
26Ezk 34:29 °∞And I will make their land famous for its crops, so my people will never again suffer from famines or the insults of foreign nations. 
26Ezk 34:30 In this way, they will know that I, the Lord their God, am with them. And they will know that they, the people of Israel, are my people, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 34:31 You are my flock, the sheep of my pasture. You are my people, and I am your God. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 35:1 Again a message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 35:2 °∞Son of man, turn and face Mount Seir, and prophesy against its people. 
26Ezk 35:3 Give them this message from the Sovereign Lord. °∞I am your enemy, O Mount Seir, and I will raise my fist against you to destroy you completely.
26Ezk 35:4 I will demolish your cities and make you desolate. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 35:5 °∞Your eternal hatred for the people of Israel led you to butcher them when they were helpless, when I had already punished them for all their sins. 
26Ezk 35:6 As surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, since you show no distaste for blood, I will give you a bloodbath of your own. Your turn has come! 
26Ezk 35:7 I will make Mount Seir utterly desolate, killing off all who try to escape and any who return. 
26Ezk 35:8 I will fill your mountains with the dead. Your hills, your valleys, and your ravines will be filled with people slaughtered by the sword. 
26Ezk 35:9 I will make you desolate forever. Your cities will never be rebuilt. Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 35:10 °∞For you said, °ÆThe lands of Israel and Judah will be ours. We will take possession of them. What do we care that the Lord is there!°Ø 
26Ezk 35:11 Therefore, as surely as I live, says the Sovereign Lord, I will pay back your angry deeds with my own. I will punish you for all your acts of anger, envy, and hatred. And I will make myself known to Israel®Á by what I do to you. / ®ÁHebrew to them; Greek version reads to you.
26Ezk 35:12 Then you will know that I, the Lord, have heard every contemptuous word you spoke against the mountains of Israel. For you said, °ÆThey are desolate; they have been given to us as food to eat!°Ø 
26Ezk 35:13 In saying that, you boasted proudly against me, and I have heard it all!
26Ezk 35:14 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ The whole world will rejoice when I make you desolate. 
26Ezk 35:15 You rejoiced at the desolation of Israel°Øs territory. Now I will rejoice at yours! You will be wiped out, you people of Mount Seir and all who live in Edom! Then you will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 36:1 °∞Son of man, prophesy to Israel°Øs mountains. Give them this message£∫ O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Lord! 
26Ezk 36:2 This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Your enemies have taunted you, saying, °ÆAha! Now the ancient heights belong to us!°Ø 
26Ezk 36:3 Therefore, son of man, give the mountains of Israel this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ Your enemies have attacked you from all directions, making you the property of many nations and the object of much mocking and slander. 
26Ezk 36:4 Therefore, O mountains of Israel, hear the word of the Sovereign Lord. He speaks to the hills and mountains, ravines and valleys, and to ruined wastes and long-deserted cities that have been destroyed and mocked by the surrounding nations. 
26Ezk 36:5 This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ My jealous anger burns against these nations, especially Edom, because they have shown utter contempt for me by gleefully taking my land for themselves as plunder.
26Ezk 36:6 °∞Therefore, prophesy to the hills and mountains, the ravines and valleys of Israel. This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I am furious that you have suffered shame before the surrounding nations. 
26Ezk 36:7 Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I have taken a solemn oath that those nations will soon have their own shame to endure.
26Ezk 36:8 °∞But the mountains of Israel will produce heavy crops of fruit for my people - for they will be coming home again soon! 
26Ezk 36:9 See, I care about you, and I will pay attention to you. Your ground will be plowed and your crops planted. 
26Ezk 36:10 I will greatly increase the population of Israel, and the ruined cities will be rebuilt and filled with people. 
26Ezk 36:11 I will increase not only the people, but also your animals. O mountains of Israel, I will bring people to live on you once again. I will make you even more prosperous than you were before. Then you will know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 36:12 I will cause my people to walk on you once again, and you will be their territory. You will never again rob them of their children.
26Ezk 36:13 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ The other nations taunt you, saying, °ÆIsrael is a land that devours its own people and robs them of their children!°Ø 
26Ezk 36:14 But you will never again devour your people or rob them of their children, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 36:15 I will not let you hear those other nations insult you, and you will no longer be mocked by them. You will not be a land that causes its nation to fall, says the Sovereign Lord.°±
26Ezk 36:16 Then this further message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 36:17 °∞Son of man, when the people of Israel were living in their own land, they defiled it by the evil way they lived. To me their conduct was as unclean as a woman°Øs menstrual cloth. 
26Ezk 36:18 They polluted the land with murder and the worship of idols®Á, so I poured out my fury on them. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung; also in 36.25.
26Ezk 36:19 I scattered them to many lands to punish them for the evil way they had lived. 
26Ezk 36:20 But when they were scattered among the nations, they brought shame on my holy name. For the nations said, °ÆThese are the people of the Lord, but he couldn°Øt keep them safe in his own land!°Ø 
26Ezk 36:21 Then I was concerned for my holy name, on which my people brought shame among the nations.
26Ezk 36:22 °∞Therefore, give the people of Israel this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ I am bringing you back, but not because you deserve it. I am doing it to protect my holy name, on which you brought shame while you were scattered among the nations. 
26Ezk 36:23 I will show how holy my great name is - the name on which you brought shame among the nations. And when I reveal my holiness through you before their very eyes, says the Sovereign Lord, then the nations will know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 36:24 For I will gather you up from all the nations and bring you home again to your land.
26Ezk 36:25 °∞Then I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you will be clean. Your filth will be washed away, and you will no longer worship idols. 
26Ezk 36:26 And I will give you a new heart, and I will put a new spirit in you. I will take out your stony, stubborn heart and give you a tender, responsive heart®Á. / ®ÁHebrew a heart of flesh.
26Ezk 36:27 And I will put my Spirit in you so that you will follow my decrees and be careful to obey my regulations.
26Ezk 36:28 °∞And you will live in Israel, the land I gave your ancestors long ago. You will be my people, and I will be your God. 
26Ezk 36:29 I will cleanse you of your filthy behavior. I will give you good crops of grain, and I will send no more famines on the land. 
26Ezk 36:30 I will give you great harvests from your fruit trees and fields, and never again will the surrounding nations be able to scoff at your land for its famines. 
26Ezk 36:31 Then you will remember your past sins and despise yourselves for all the detestable things you did. 
26Ezk 36:32 But remember, says the Sovereign Lord, I am not doing this because you deserve it. O my people of Israel, you should be utterly ashamed of all you have done!
26Ezk 36:33 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ When I cleanse you from your sins, I will repopulate your cities, and the ruins will be rebuilt. 
26Ezk 36:34 The fields that used to lie empty and desolate in plain view of everyone will again be farmed. 
26Ezk 36:35 And when I bring you back, people will say, °ÆThis former wasteland is now like the Garden of Eden! The abandoned and ruined cities now have strong walls and are filled with people!°Ø 
26Ezk 36:36 Then the surrounding nations that survive will know that I, the Lord, have rebuilt the ruins and replanted the wasteland. For I, the Lord, have spoken, and I will do what I say.
26Ezk 36:37 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I am ready to hear Israel°Øs prayers and to increase their numbers like a flock. 
26Ezk 36:38 They will be as numerous as the sacred flocks that fill Jerusalem°Øs streets at the time of her festivals. The ruined cities will be crowded with people once more, and everyone will know that I am the Lord.°±
26Ezk 37:1 The Lord took hold of me, and I was carried away by the Spirit of the Lord to a valley filled with bones. 
26Ezk 37:2 He led me all around among the bones that covered the valley floor. They were scattered everywhere across the ground and were completely dried out. 
26Ezk 37:3 Then he asked me, °∞Son of man, can these bones become living people again?°± °∞O Sovereign Lord,°± I replied, °∞you alone know the answer to that.°±
26Ezk 37:4 Then he said to me, °∞Speak a prophetic message to these bones and say, °ÆDry bones, listen to the word of the Lord! 
26Ezk 37:5 This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Look! I am going to put breath into you and make you live again! 
26Ezk 37:6 I will put flesh and muscles on you and cover you with skin. I will put breath into you, and you will come to life. Then you will know that I am the Lord.°Ø°±
26Ezk 37:7 So I spoke this message, just as he told me. Suddenly as I spoke, there was a rattling noise all across the valley. The bones of each body came together and attached themselves as complete skeletons. 
26Ezk 37:8 Then as I watched, muscles and flesh formed over the bones. Then skin formed to cover their bodies, but they still had no breath in them.
26Ezk 37:9 Then he said to me, °∞Speak a prophetic message to the winds, son of man. Speak a prophetic message and say, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Come, O breath, from the four winds! Breathe into these dead bodies so they may live again.°Ø°±
26Ezk 37:10 So I spoke the message as he commanded me, and breath came into their bodies. They all came to life and stood up on their feet - a great army.
26Ezk 37:11 Then he said to me, °∞Son of man, these bones represent the people of Israel. They are saying, °ÆWe have become old, dry bones - all hope is gone. Our nation is finished.°Ø 
26Ezk 37:12 Therefore, prophesy to them and say, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ O my people, I will open your graves of exile and cause you to rise again. Then I will bring you back to the land of Israel. 
26Ezk 37:13 When this happens, O my people, you will know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 37:14 I will put my Spirit in you, and you will live again and return home to your own land. Then you will know that I, the Lord, have spoken, and I have done what I said. Yes, the Lord has spoken!°Ø°±
26Ezk 37:15 Again a message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 37:16 °∞Son of man, take a piece of wood and carve on it these words£∫ °ÆThis represents Judah and its allied tribes.°Ø Then take another piece and carve these words on it£∫ °ÆThis represents Ephraim and the northern tribes of Israel.°Ø®Á / ®ÁHebrew This is Ephraim°Øs wood, representing Joseph and all the house of Israel.
26Ezk 37:17 Now hold them together in your hand as if they were one piece of wood. 
26Ezk 37:18 When your people ask you what your actions mean, 
26Ezk 37:19 say to them, °ÆThis is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will take Ephraim and the northern tribes and join them to Judah. I will make them one piece of wood in my hand.°Ø
26Ezk 37:20 °∞Then hold out the pieces of wood you have inscribed, so the people can see them. 
26Ezk 37:21 And give them this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ I will gather the people of Israel from among the nations. I will bring them home to their own land from the places where they have been scattered. 
26Ezk 37:22 I will unify them into one nation on the mountains of Israel. One king will rule them all; no longer will they be divided into two nations or into two kingdoms. 
26Ezk 37:23 They will never again pollute themselves with their idols®Á and vile images and rebellion, for I will save them from their sinful backsliding. I will cleanse them. Then they will truly be my people, and I will be their God. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung.
26Ezk 37:24 °∞My servant David will be their king, and they will have only one shepherd. They will obey my regulations and be careful to keep my decrees. 
26Ezk 37:25 They will live in the land I gave my servant Jacob, the land where their ancestors lived. They and their children and their grandchildren after them will live there forever, generation after generation. And my servant David will be their prince forever. 
26Ezk 37:26 And I will make a covenant of peace with them, an everlasting covenant. I will give them their land and increase their numbers®Á, and I will put my Temple among them forever. / ®ÁHebrew reads I will give them and increase their numbers; Greek version omits the entire phrase.
26Ezk 37:27 I will make my home among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 
26Ezk 37:28 And when my Temple is among them forever, the nations will know that I am the Lord, who makes Israel holy.°±
26Ezk 38:1 This is another message that came to me from the Lord£∫ 
26Ezk 38:2 °∞Son of man, turn and face Gog of the land of Magog, the prince who rules over the nations of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him. 
26Ezk 38:3 Give him this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ Gog, I am your enemy! 
26Ezk 38:4 I will turn you around and put hooks in your jaws to lead you out with your whole army - your horses and charioteers in full armor and a great horde armed with shields and swords. 
26Ezk 38:5 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya®Á will join you, too, with all their weapons. / ®ÁHebrew Paras, Cush, and Put.
26Ezk 38:6 Gomer and all its armies will also join you, along with the armies of Beth-togarmah from the distant north, and many others.
26Ezk 38:7 °∞Get ready; be prepared! Keep all the armies around you mobilized, and take command of them. 
26Ezk 38:8 A long time from now you will be called into action. In the distant future you will swoop down on the land of Israel, which will be enjoying peace after recovering from war and after its people have returned from many lands to the mountains of Israel. 
26Ezk 38:9 You and all your allies - a vast and awesome army - will roll down on them like a storm and cover the land like a cloud.
26Ezk 38:10 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ At that time evil thoughts will come to your mind, and you will devise a wicked scheme. 
26Ezk 38:11 You will say, °ÆIsrael is an unprotected land filled with unwalled villages! I will march against her and destroy these people who live in such confidence! 
26Ezk 38:12 I will go to those formerly desolate cities that are now filled with people who have returned from exile in many nations. I will capture vast amounts of plunder, for the people are rich with livestock and other possessions now. They think the whole world revolves around them!°Ø 
26Ezk 38:13 But Sheba and Dedan and the merchants of Tarshish will ask, °ÆDo you really think the armies you have gathered can rob them of silver and gold? Do you think you can drive away their livestock and seize their goods and carry off plunder?°Ø
26Ezk 38:14 °∞Therefore, son of man, prophesy against Gog. Give him this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ When my people are living in peace in their land, then you will rouse yourself®Á. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads then you will know.
26Ezk 38:15 You will come from your homeland in the distant north with your vast cavalry and your mighty army, 
26Ezk 38:16 and you will attack my people Israel, covering their land like a cloud. At that time in the distant future, I will bring you against my land as everyone watches, and my holiness will be displayed by what happens to you, Gog. Then all the nations will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 38:17 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord asks£∫ Are you the one I was talking about long ago, when I announced through Israel°Øs prophets that in the future I would bring you against my people? 
26Ezk 38:18 But this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ When Gog invades the land of Israel, my fury will boil over! 
26Ezk 38:19 In my jealousy and blazing anger, I promise a mighty shaking in the land of Israel on that day. 
26Ezk 38:20 All living things - the fish in the sea, the birds of the sky, the animals of the field, the small animals that scurry along the ground, and all the people on earth - will quake in terror at my presence. Mountains will be thrown down; cliffs will crumble; walls will fall to the earth. 
26Ezk 38:21 I will summon the sword against you on all the hills of Israel, says the Sovereign Lord. Your men will turn their swords against each other. 
26Ezk 38:22 I will punish you and your armies with disease and bloodshed; I will send torrential rain, hailstones, fire, and burning sulfur! 
26Ezk 38:23 In this way, I will show my greatness and holiness, and I will make myself known to all the nations of the world. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 39:1 °∞Son of man, prophesy against Gog. Give him this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ I am your enemy, O Gog, ruler of the nations of Meshech and Tubal. 
26Ezk 39:2 I will turn you around and drive you toward the mountains of Israel, bringing you from the distant north. 
26Ezk 39:3 I will knock the bow from your left hand and the arrows from your right hand, and I will leave you helpless. 
26Ezk 39:4 You and your army and your allies will all die on the mountains. I will feed you to the vultures and wild animals. 
26Ezk 39:5 You will fall in the open fields, for I have spoken, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 39:6 And I will rain down fire on Magog and on all your allies who live safely on the coasts. Then they will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 39:7 °∞In this way, I will make known my holy name among my people of Israel. I will not let anyone bring shame on it. And the nations, too, will know that I am the Lord, the Holy One of Israel. 
26Ezk 39:8 That day of judgment will come, says the Sovereign Lord. Everything will happen just as I have declared it.
26Ezk 39:9 °∞Then the people in the towns of Israel will go out and pick up your small and large shields, bows and arrows, javelins and spears, and they will use them for fuel. There will be enough to last them seven years! 
26Ezk 39:10 They won°Øt need to cut wood from the fields or forests, for these weapons will give them all the fuel they need. They will plunder those who planned to plunder them, and they will rob those who planned to rob them, says the Sovereign Lord.
26Ezk 39:11 °∞And I will make a vast graveyard for Gog and his hordes in the Valley of the Travelers, east of the Dead Sea®Á. It will block the way of those who travel there, and they will change the name of the place to the Valley of Gog°Øs Hordes. / ®ÁHebrew the sea.
26Ezk 39:12 It will take seven months for the people of Israel to bury the bodies and cleanse the land. 
26Ezk 39:13 Everyone in Israel will help, for it will be a glorious victory for Israel when I demonstrate my glory on that day, says the Sovereign Lord.
26Ezk 39:14 °∞After seven months, teams of men will be appointed to search the land for skeletons to bury, so the land will be made clean again. 
26Ezk 39:15 Whenever bones are found, a marker will be set up so the burial crews will take them to be buried in the Valley of Gog°Øs Hordes. 
26Ezk 39:16 (There will be a town there named Hamonah, which means °Æhorde.°Ø) And so the land will finally be cleansed.
26Ezk 39:17 °∞And now, son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Call all the birds and wild animals. Say to them£∫ Gather together for my great sacrificial feast. Come from far and near to the mountains of Israel, and there eat flesh and drink blood! 
26Ezk 39:18 Eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of princes as though they were rams, lambs, goats, and bulls - all fattened animals from Bashan! 
26Ezk 39:19 Gorge yourselves with flesh until you are glutted; drink blood until you are drunk. This is the sacrificial feast I have prepared for you. 
26Ezk 39:20 Feast at my banquet table - feast on horses and charioteers, on mighty men and all kinds of valiant warriors, says the Sovereign Lord.
26Ezk 39:21 °∞In this way, I will demonstrate my glory to the nations. Everyone will see the punishment I have inflicted on them and the power of my fist when I strike. 
26Ezk 39:22 And from that time on the people of Israel will know that I am the Lord their God. 
26Ezk 39:23 The nations will then know why Israel was sent away to exile - it was punishment for sin, for they were unfaithful to their God. Therefore, I turned away from them and let their enemies destroy them. 
26Ezk 39:24 I turned my face away and punished them because of their defilement and their sins.
26Ezk 39:25 °∞So now, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ I will end the captivity of my people®Á; I will have mercy on all Israel, for I jealously guard my holy reputation! / ®ÁHebrew of Jacob.
26Ezk 39:26 They will accept responsibility for their past shame and unfaithfulness after they come home to live in peace in their own land, with no one to bother them. 
26Ezk 39:27 When I bring them home from the lands of their enemies, I will display my holiness among them for all the nations to see. 
26Ezk 39:28 Then my people will know that I am the Lord their God, because I sent them away to exile and brought them home again. I will leave none of my people behind. 
26Ezk 39:29 And I will never again turn my face from them, for I will pour out my Spirit upon the people of Israel. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 40:1 On April 28®Á, during the twenty-fifth year of our captivity - fourteen years after the fall of Jerusalem - the Lord took hold of me. / ®ÁHebrew At the beginning of the year, on the tenth day of the month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This event occurred on April 28, 573 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.
26Ezk 40:2 In a vision from God he took me to the land of Israel and set me down on a very high mountain. From there I could see toward the south what appeared to be a city. 
26Ezk 40:3 As he brought me nearer, I saw a man whose face shone like bronze standing beside a gateway entrance. He was holding in his hand a linen measuring cord and a measuring rod.
26Ezk 40:4 He said to me, °∞Son of man, watch and listen. Pay close attention to everything I show you. You have been brought here so I can show you many things. Then you will return to the people of Israel and tell them everything you have seen.°±
26Ezk 40:5 I could see a wall completely surrounding the Temple area. The man took a measuring rod that was 10 1/2 feet®Á long and measured the wall, and the wall was 10 1/2 feet®Ë thick and 10 1/2 feet high. / ®ÁHebrew 6 long cubits [3.2 meters], each being a cubit [18 inches or 45 centimeters] and a handbreadth [3 inches or 8 centimeters] in length. ®ËHebrew 1 rod [3.2 meters]; also in 40.5c, 7.
26Ezk 40:6 Then he went over to the eastern gateway. He climbed the steps and measured the threshold of the gateway; it was 10 1/2 feet front to back®Á. / ®ÁAs in Greek version, which reads 1 rod [3.2 meters] deep; Hebrew reads 1 rod deep, and 1 threshold, 1 rod deep.
26Ezk 40:7 There were guard alcoves on each side built into the gateway passage. Each of these alcoves was 10 1/2 feet square, with a distance between them of 8 3/4 feet®Á along the passage wall. The gateway°Øs inner threshold, which led to the entry room at the inner end of the gateway passage, was 10 1/2 feet front to back. / ®ÁHebrew 5 cubits [2.7 meters]; also in 40.48.
26Ezk 40:8 He also measured the entry room of the gateway®Á. / ®ÁMany Hebrew manuscripts add which faced inward toward the Temple; it was 1 rod [10.5 feet or 3.2 meters] deep. 9Then he measured the entry room of the gateway.
26Ezk 40:9 It was 14 feet®Á across, with supporting columns 3 1/2 feet®Ë thick. This entry room was at the inner end of the gateway structure, facing toward the Temple. / ®ÁHebrew 8 cubits [4.2 meters]. ®ËHebrew 2 cubits [1.1 meters].
26Ezk 40:10 There were three guard alcoves on each side of the gateway passage. Each had the same measurements, and the dividing walls separating them were also identical. 
26Ezk 40:11 The man measured the gateway entrance, which was 17 1/2 feet®Á wide at the opening and 22 3/4 feet®Ë wide in the gateway passage. / ®ÁHebrew 10 cubits [5.3 meters]. ®ËHebrew 13 cubits [6.9 meters].
26Ezk 40:12 In front of each of the guard alcoves was a 21-inch®Á curb. The alcoves themselves were 10 1/2 feet®Ë on each side. / ®ÁHebrew 1 cubit [53 centimeters]. ®ËHebrew 6 cubits [3.2 meters].
26Ezk 40:13 Then he measured the entire width of the gateway, measuring the distance between the back walls of facing guard alcoves; this distance was 43 3/4 feet®Á. / ®ÁHebrew 25 cubits [13.3 meters]; also in 40.21, 25, 29, 30, 33, 36.
26Ezk 40:14 He measured the dividing walls all along the inside of the gateway up to the entry room of the gateway; this distance was 105 feet®Á. / ®ÁHebrew 60 cubits [31.8 meters]. The meaning of the Hebrew in this verse is uncertain.
26Ezk 40:15 The full length of the gateway passage was 87 1/2 feet®Á from one end to the other. / ®ÁHebrew 50 cubits [26.5 meters]; also in 40.21, 25, 29, 33, 36.
26Ezk 40:16 There were recessed windows that narrowed inward through the walls of the guard alcoves and their dividing walls. There were also windows in the entry room. The surfaces of the dividing walls were decorated with carved palm trees.
26Ezk 40:17 Then the man brought me through the gateway into the outer courtyard of the Temple. A stone pavement ran along the walls of the courtyard, and thirty rooms were built against the walls, opening onto the pavement. 
26Ezk 40:18 This pavement flanked the gates and extended out from the walls into the courtyard the same distance as the gateway entrance. This was the lower pavement. 
26Ezk 40:19 Then the man measured across the Temple°Øs outer courtyard between the outer and inner gateways; the distance was 175 feet®Á. / ®ÁHebrew 100 cubits [53 meters]; also in 40.23, 27, 47.
26Ezk 40:20 The man measured the gateway on the north just like the one on the east. 
26Ezk 40:21 Here, too, there were three guard alcoves on each side, with dividing walls and an entry room. All the measurements matched those of the east gateway. The gateway passage was 87 1/2 feet long and 43 3/4 feet wide between the back walls of facing guard alcoves. 
26Ezk 40:22 The windows, the entry room, and the palm tree decorations were identical to those in the east gateway. There were seven steps leading up to the gateway entrance, and the entry room was at the inner end of the gateway passage. 
26Ezk 40:23 Here on the north side, just as on the east, there was another gateway leading to the Temple°Øs inner courtyard directly opposite this outer gateway. The distance between the two gateways was 175 feet.
26Ezk 40:24 Then the man took me around to the south gateway and measured its various parts, and they were exactly the same as in the others. 
26Ezk 40:25 It had windows along the walls as the others did, and there was an entry room where the gateway passage opened into the outer courtyard. And like the others, the gateway passage was 87 1/2 feet long and 43 3/4 feet wide between the back walls of facing guard alcoves. 
26Ezk 40:26 This gateway also had a stairway of seven steps leading up to it, and an entry room at the inner end, and palm tree decorations along the dividing walls. 
26Ezk 40:27 And here again, directly opposite the outer gateway, was another gateway that led into the inner courtyard. The distance between the two gateways was 175 feet.
26Ezk 40:28 Then the man took me to the south gateway leading into the inner courtyard. He measured it, and it had the same measurements as the other gateways. 
26Ezk 40:29 Its guard alcoves, dividing walls, and entry room were the same size as those in the others. It also had windows along its walls and in the entry room. And like the others, the gateway passage was 87 1/2 feet long and 43 3/4 feet wide. 
26Ezk 40:30 (The entry rooms of the gateways leading into the inner courtyard were 14 feet®Á across and 43 3/4 feet wide.) / ®ÁAs in 40.9, which reads 8 cubits [14 feet or 4.2 meters]; here the Hebrew reads 5 cubits [8 3/4 feet or 2.7 meters]. Some Hebrew manuscripts and the Greek version omit this entire verse.
26Ezk 40:31 The entry room to the south gateway faced into the outer courtyard. It had palm tree decorations on its columns, and there were eight steps leading to its entrance.
26Ezk 40:32 Then he took me to the east gateway leading to the inner courtyard. He measured it, and it had the same measurements as the other gateways. 
26Ezk 40:33 Its guard alcoves, dividing walls, and entry room were the same size as those of the others, and there were windows along the walls and in the entry room. The gateway passage measured 87 1/2 feet long and 43 3/4 feet wide. 
26Ezk 40:34 Its entry room faced into the outer courtyard. It had palm tree decorations on its columns, and there were eight steps leading to its entrance.
26Ezk 40:35 Then he took me around to the north gateway leading to the inner courtyard. He measured it, and it had the same measurements as the other gateways. 
26Ezk 40:36 The guard alcoves, dividing walls, and entry room of this gateway had the same measurements as in the others and the same window arrangements. The gateway passage measured 87 1/2 feet long and 43 3/4 feet wide. 
26Ezk 40:37 Its entry room faced into the outer courtyard, and it had palm tree decorations on the columns. There were eight steps leading to its entrance.
26Ezk 40:38 A door led from the entry room of one of the inner gateways into a side room, where the meat for sacrifices was washed. 
26Ezk 40:39 On each side of this entry room were two tables, where the sacrificial animals were slaughtered for the burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings. 
26Ezk 40:40 Outside the entry room, on each side of the stairs going up to the north entrance, were two more tables. 
26Ezk 40:41 So there were eight tables in all - four inside and four outside - where the sacrifices were cut up and prepared. 
26Ezk 40:42 There were also four tables of finished stone for preparation of the burnt offerings, each 31 1/2 inches square and 21 inches high®Á. On these tables were placed the butchering knives and other implements for slaughtering the sacrificial animals. / ®ÁHebrew 1 1/2 cubits [80 centimeters] long and 1 1/2 cubits wide and 1 cubit [53 centimeters] high.
26Ezk 40:43 There were hooks, each 3 inches®Á long, fastened to the foyer walls. The sacrificial meat was laid on the tables. / ®ÁHebrew a handbreadth [8 centimeters].
26Ezk 40:44 Inside the inner courtyard were two rooms®Á, one beside the north gateway, facing south, and the other beside the south®Ë gateway, facing north. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads rooms for singers. ®ËAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads east.
26Ezk 40:45 And the man said to me, °∞The room beside the north inner gate is for the priests who supervise the Temple maintenance. 
26Ezk 40:46 The room beside the south inner gate is for the priests in charge of the altar - the descendants of Zadok - for they alone of all the Levites may approach the Lord to minister to him.°±
26Ezk 40:47 Then the man measured the inner courtyard, and it was a square, 175 feet wide and 175 feet across. The altar stood in the courtyard in front of the Temple. 
26Ezk 40:48 Then he brought me to the entry room of the Temple. He measured the walls on either side of the opening to the entry room, and they were 8 3/4 feet thick. The entrance itself was 24 1/2 feet®Á wide, and the walls on each side of the entrance were an additional 5 1/4 feet®Ë long. / ®ÁHebrew 14 cubits [7.4 meters]. ®ËHebrew 3 cubits [1.6 meters].
26Ezk 40:49 The entry room was 35 feet®Á wide and 21 feet®Ë deep. There were ten steps leading up to it, with a column on each side. / ®ÁHebrew 20 cubits [10.6 meters]. ®ËAs in Greek version, which reads 12 cubits [21 feet or 6.4 meters]; Hebrew reads 11 cubits [19 1/4 feet or 5.8 meters].
26Ezk 41:1 After that, the man brought me into the sanctuary of the Temple. He measured the walls on either side of its doorway, and they were 10 1/2 feet®Á thick. / ®ÁHebrew 6 cubits [3.2 meters]; also in 41.3, 5.
26Ezk 41:2 The doorway was 17 1/2 feet®Á wide, and the walls on each side of it were 8 3/4 feet®Ë long. The sanctuary itself was 70 feet long and 35 feet wide®Ë. / ®ÁHebrew 10 cubits [5.3 meters]. ®ËHebrew 5 cubits [2.7 meters]; also in 41.9, 11. ®ÈHebrew 40 cubits [21.2 meters] long and 20 cubits [10.6 meters] wide.
26Ezk 41:3 Then he went beyond the sanctuary into the inner room. He measured the walls on either side of its entrance, and they were 3 1/2 feet®Á thick. The entrance was 10 1/2 feet wide, and the walls on each side of the entrance were 12 1/4 feet®Ë long. / ®ÁHebrew 2 cubits [1.1 meters]. ®ËHebrew 7 cubits [3.7 meters].
26Ezk 41:4 The inner room of the sanctuary was 35 feet®Á long and 35 feet wide. °∞This,°± he told me, °∞is the Most Holy Place.°± / ®ÁHebrew 20 cubits [10.6 meters]; also in 41.4b, 10.
26Ezk 41:5 Then he measured the wall of the Temple, and it was 10 1/2 feet thick. There was a row of rooms along the outside wall; each room was 7 feet®Á wide. / ®ÁHebrew 4 cubits [2.1 meters].
26Ezk 41:6 These side rooms were built in three levels, one above the other, with thirty rooms on each level. The supports for these side rooms rested on exterior ledges on the Temple wall; they did not extend into the wall. 
26Ezk 41:7 Each level was wider than the one below it, corresponding to the narrowing of the Temple wall as it rose higher. A stairway led up from the bottom level through the middle level to the top level.
26Ezk 41:8 I saw that the Temple was built on a terrace, which provided a foundation for the side rooms. This terrace was 10 1/2 feet®Á high. / ®ÁHebrew 1 rod, 6 cubits [3.2 meters].
26Ezk 41:9 The outer wall of the Temple°Øs side rooms was 8 3/4 feet thick. This left an open area between these side rooms 
26Ezk 41:10 and the row of rooms along the outer wall of the inner courtyard. This open area was 35 feet wide, and it went all the way around the Temple. 
26Ezk 41:11 Two doors opened from the side rooms into the terrace yard, which was 8 3/4 feet wide. One door faced north and the other south.
26Ezk 41:12 A large building stood on the west, facing the Temple courtyard. It was 122 1/2 feet wide and 157 1/2 feet long, and its walls were 8 3/4 feet®Á thick. / ®ÁHebrew 70 cubits [37.1 meters] wide and 90 cubits [47.7 meters] long, and its walls were 5 cubits [2.7 meters] thick.
26Ezk 41:13 Then the man measured the Temple, and it was 175 feet®Á long. The courtyard around the building, including its walls, was an additional 175 feet in length. / ®ÁHebrew 100 cubits [53 meters]; also in 41.13b, 14, 15.
26Ezk 41:14 The inner courtyard to the east of the Temple was also 175 feet wide. 
26Ezk 41:15 The building to the west, including its two walls, was also 175 feet wide. The sanctuary, the inner room, and the entry room of the Temple 
26Ezk 41:16 were all paneled with wood, as were the frames of the recessed windows. The inner walls of the Temple were paneled with wood above and below the windows. 
26Ezk 41:17 The space above the door leading into the inner room, and its walls inside and out, were also paneled. 
26Ezk 41:18 All the walls were decorated with carvings of cherubim, each with two faces, and there was a carving of a palm tree between each of the cherubim. 
26Ezk 41:19 One face - that of a man - looked toward the palm tree on one side. The other face - that of a young lion - looked toward the palm tree on the other side. The figures were carved all along the inside of the Temple, 
26Ezk 41:20 from the floor to the top of the walls, including the outer wall of the sanctuary.
26Ezk 41:21 There were square columns at the entrance to the sanctuary, and the ones at the entrance of the Most Holy Place were similar. 
26Ezk 41:22 There was an altar made of wood, 5 1/4 feet high and 3 1/2 feet across®Á. Its corners, base, and sides were all made of wood. °∞This,°± the man told me, °∞is the table that stands in the Lord°Øs presence.°± / ®ÁHebrew 3 cubits [1.6 meters] high and 2 cubits [1.1 meters] across.
26Ezk 41:23 Both the sanctuary and the Most Holy Place had double doorways, 
26Ezk 41:24 each with two swinging doors. 
26Ezk 41:25 The doors leading into the sanctuary were decorated with carved cherubim and palm trees, just as on the walls. And there was a wooden roof at the front of the entry room to the Temple. 
26Ezk 41:26 On both sides of the entry room were recessed windows decorated with carved palm trees. The side rooms along the outside wall also had roofs.
26Ezk 42:1 Then the man led me out of the Temple courtyard by way of the north gateway. We entered the outer courtyard and came to a group of rooms against the north wall of the inner courtyard. 
26Ezk 42:2 This structure, whose entrance opened toward the north, was 175 feet long and 87 1/2 feet wide®Á. / ®ÁHebrew 100 cubits [53 meters] long and 50 cubits [26.5 meters] wide.
26Ezk 42:3 One block of rooms overlooked the 35-foot®Á width of the inner courtyard. Another block of rooms looked out onto the pavement of the outer courtyard. The two blocks were built three levels high and stood across from each other. / ®ÁHebrew 20 cubits [10.6 meters].
26Ezk 42:4 Between the two blocks of rooms ran a walkway 17 1/2 feet®Á wide. It extended the entire 175 feet®Ë of the complex, and all the doors faced north. / ®ÁHebrew 10 cubits [5.3 meters]. ®ËHebrew 100 cubits [53 meters]; also in 42.8.
26Ezk 42:5 Each of the two upper levels of rooms was narrower than the one beneath it because the upper levels had to allow space for walkways in front of them. 
26Ezk 42:6 Since there were three levels and they did not have supporting columns as in the courtyards, each of the upper levels was set back from the level beneath it. 
26Ezk 42:7 There was an outer wall that separated the rooms from the outer courtyard; it was 87 1/2 feet®Á long. / ®ÁHebrew 50 cubits [26.5 meters]; also in 42.8.
26Ezk 42:8 This wall added length to the outer block of rooms, which extended for only 87 1/2 feet, while the inner block - the rooms toward the Temple - extended for 175 feet. 
26Ezk 42:9 There was an eastern entrance from the outer courtyard to these rooms.
26Ezk 42:10 On the south®Á side of the Temple there were two blocks of rooms just south of the inner courtyard between the Temple and the outer courtyard. These rooms were arranged just like the rooms on the north. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads east.
26Ezk 42:11 There was a walkway between the two blocks of rooms just like the complex on the north side of the Temple. This complex of rooms was the same length and width as the other one, and it had the same entrances and doors. The dimensions of each were identical. 
26Ezk 42:12 So there was an entrance in the wall facing the doors of the inner block of rooms, and another on the east at the end of the interior walkway.
26Ezk 42:13 Then the man told me, °∞These rooms that overlook the Temple from the north and south are holy. Here the priests who offer sacrifices to the Lord will eat the most holy offerings. And because these rooms are holy, they will be used to store the sacred offerings - the grain offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings. 
26Ezk 42:14 When the priests leave the sanctuary, they must not go directly to the outer courtyard. They must first take off the clothes they wore while ministering, because these clothes are holy. They must put on other clothes before entering the parts of the building complex open to the public.°±
26Ezk 42:15 When the man had finished measuring the inside of the Temple area, he led me out through the east gateway to measure the entire perimeter. 
26Ezk 42:16 He measured the east side with his measuring rod, and it was 875 feet long®Á. / ®ÁAs in 45.2 and in Greek version at 42.17, which reads 500 cubits [265 meters]; Hebrew reads 500 rods [5,250 feet or 1,590 meters]; similarly in 42.17, 18, 19, 20.
26Ezk 42:17 Then he measured the north side, and it was also 875 feet. 
26Ezk 42:18 The south side was also 875 feet, 
26Ezk 42:19 and the west side was also 875 feet. 
26Ezk 42:20 So the area was 875 feet on each side with a wall all around it to separate what was holy from what was common.
26Ezk 43:1 After this, the man brought me back around to the east gateway. 
26Ezk 43:2 Suddenly, the glory of the God of Israel appeared from the east. The sound of his coming was like the roar of rushing waters, and the whole landscape shone with his glory. 
26Ezk 43:3 This vision was just like the others I had seen, first by the Kebar River and then when he came to destroy Jerusalem. I fell face down on the ground. 
26Ezk 43:4 And the glory of the Lord came into the Temple through the east gateway.
26Ezk 43:5 Then the Spirit took me up and brought me into the inner courtyard, and the glory of the Lord filled the Temple. 
26Ezk 43:6 And I heard someone speaking to me from within the Temple, while the man who had been measuring stood beside me. 
26Ezk 43:7 The Lord said to me, °∞Son of man, this is the place of my throne and the place where I will rest my feet. I will live here forever among the people of Israel. They and their kings will not defile my holy name any longer by their adulterous worship of other gods or by honoring the relics of their kings who have died. 
26Ezk 43:8 They put their idol altars right next to mine with only a wall between them and me. They defiled my holy name by such detestable sin, so I consumed them in my anger. 
26Ezk 43:9 Now let them stop worshiping other gods and honoring the relics of their kings, and I will live among them forever.
26Ezk 43:10 °∞Son of man, describe to the people of Israel the Temple I have shown you, so they will be ashamed of all their sins. Let them study its plan, 
26Ezk 43:11 and they will be ashamed®Á of what they have done. Describe to them all the specifications of the Temple - including its entrances and exits - and everything else about it. Tell them about its decrees and laws. Write down all these specifications and decrees as they watch so they will be sure to remember and follow them. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads if they are ashamed.
26Ezk 43:12 And this is the basic law of the Temple£∫ absolute holiness! The entire top of the mountain where the Temple is built is holy. Yes, this is the basic law of the Temple.
26Ezk 43:13 °∞These are the measurements of the altar®Á£∫ There is a gutter all around the altar 21 inches deep and 21 inches wide®Ë, with a curb 9 inches®È wide around its edge. And this is the height®Í of the altar£∫ / ®ÁHebrew measurements of the altar in long cubits, each being a cubit [18 inches or 45 centimeters] and a handbreadth [3 inches or 8 centimeters] in length. ®ËHebrew a cubit [53 centimeters] deep and a cubit wide. ®ÈHebrew 1 span [23 centimeters]. ®ÍAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads base.
26Ezk 43:14 From the gutter the altar rises 3 1/2 feet®Á to a lower ledge that surrounds the altar and is 21 inches®Ë wide. From the lower ledge the altar rises 7 feet®È to the upper ledge that is also 21 inches wide. / ®ÁHebrew 2 cubits [1.1 meters]. ®ËHebrew 1 cubit [53 centimeters]; also in 43.14d. ®ÈHebrew 4 cubits [2.1 meters]; also in 43.15.
26Ezk 43:15 The top of the altar, the hearth, rises another 7 feet higher, with a horn rising up from each of the four corners. 
26Ezk 43:16 The top of the altar is square, measuring 21 feet by 21 feet®Á. / ®ÁHebrew 12 cubits [6.4 meters] long and 12 cubits wide.
26Ezk 43:17 The upper ledge also forms a square, measuring 24 1/2 feet by 24 1/2 feet®Á, with a 21-inch gutter and a 10 1/2-inch curb®Á all around the edge. There are steps going up the east side of the altar.°± / ®ÁHebrew 14 cubits [7.4 meters] long and 14 cubits wide. ®ËHebrew a gutter of 1 cubit [53 centimeters] and a curb of 1/2 a cubit [27 centimeters].
26Ezk 43:18 Then he said to me, °∞Son of man, this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ These will be the regulations for the burning of offerings and the sprinkling of blood when the altar is built. 
26Ezk 43:19 At that time, the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok, who minister before me, are to be given a young bull for a sin offering, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 43:20 You will take some of its blood and smear it on the four horns of the altar, the four corners of the upper ledge, and the curb that runs around that ledge. This will cleanse and make atonement for the altar. 
26Ezk 43:21 Then take the young bull for the sin offering and burn it at the appointed place outside the Temple area.
26Ezk 43:22 °∞On the second day, sacrifice as a sin offering a young male goat that has no physical defects. Then cleanse and make atonement for the altar again, just as you did with the young bull. 
26Ezk 43:23 When you have finished the cleansing ceremony, offer another young bull that has no defects and a perfect ram from the flock. 
26Ezk 43:24 You are to present them to the Lord, and the priests are to sprinkle salt on them and offer them as a burnt offering to the Lord.
26Ezk 43:25 °∞Every day for seven days a male goat, a young bull, and a ram from the flock will be sacrificed as a sin offering. None of these animals may have physical defects of any kind. 
26Ezk 43:26 Do this each day for seven days to cleanse and make atonement for the altar, thus setting it apart for holy use. 
26Ezk 43:27 On the eighth day, and on each day afterward, the priests will sacrifice on the altar the burnt offerings and peace offerings of the people. Then I will accept you. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
26Ezk 44:1 Then the man brought me back to the east gateway in the outer wall of the Temple area, but it was closed. 
26Ezk 44:2 And the Lord said to me, °∞This gate must remain closed; it will never again be opened. No one will ever open it and pass through, for the Lord, the God of Israel, has entered here. Therefore, it must always remain shut. 
26Ezk 44:3 Only the prince himself may sit inside this gateway to feast in the Lord°Øs presence. But he may come and go only through the entry room of the gateway.°±
26Ezk 44:4 Then the man brought me through the north gateway to the front of the Temple. I looked and saw that the glory of the Lord filled the Temple of the Lord, and I fell face down on the ground.
26Ezk 44:5 And the Lord said to me, °∞Son of man, take careful notice. Use your eyes and ears, and listen to everything I tell you about the regulations concerning the Lord°Øs Temple. Take careful note of the procedures for using the Temple°Øs entrances and exits. 
26Ezk 44:6 And give these rebels, the people of Israel, this message from the Sovereign Lord£∫ O people of Israel, enough of your detestable sins! 
26Ezk 44:7 You have brought uncircumcised foreigners into my sanctuary - people who have no heart for God. In this way, you defiled my Temple even as you offered me my food, the fat and blood of sacrifices. In addition to all your other detestable sins, you have broken my covenant. 
26Ezk 44:8 Instead of safeguarding my sacred rituals, you have hired foreigners to take charge of my sanctuary.
26Ezk 44:9 °∞So this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ No foreigners, including those who live among the people of Israel, will enter my sanctuary if they have not been circumcised and have not surrendered themselves to the Lord. 
26Ezk 44:10 And the men of the tribe of Levi who abandoned me when Israel strayed away from me to worship idols®Á must bear the consequences of their unfaithfulness. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung; also in 44.12.
26Ezk 44:11 They may still be Temple guards and gatekeepers, and they may slaughter the animals brought for burnt offerings and be present to help the people. 
26Ezk 44:12 But they encouraged my people to worship idols, causing Israel to fall into deep sin. So I have taken a solemn oath that they must bear the consequences for their sins, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 44:13 They may not approach me to minister as priests. They may not touch any of my holy things or the holy offerings, for they must bear the shame of all the detestable sins they have committed. 
26Ezk 44:14 They are to serve as the Temple caretakers, taking charge of the maintenance work and performing general duties.
26Ezk 44:15 °∞However, the Levitical priests of the family of Zadok continued to minister faithfully in the Temple when Israel abandoned me for idols. These men will serve as my ministers. They will stand in my presence and offer the fat and blood of the sacrifices, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 44:16 They alone will enter my sanctuary and approach my table to serve me. They will fulfill all my requirements.
26Ezk 44:17 °∞When they enter the gateway to the inner courtyard, they must wear only linen clothing. They must wear no wool while on duty in the inner courtyard or in the Temple itself. 
26Ezk 44:18 They must wear linen turbans and linen undergarments. They must not wear anything that would cause them to perspire. 
26Ezk 44:19 When they return to the outer courtyard where the people are, they must take off the clothes they wear while ministering to me. They must leave them in the sacred rooms and put on other clothes so they do not endanger anyone by transmitting holiness to them through this clothing.
26Ezk 44:20 °∞They must neither shave their heads nor let their hair grow too long. Instead, they must trim it regularly. 
26Ezk 44:21 The priests must not drink wine before entering the inner courtyard. 
26Ezk 44:22 They may choose their wives only from among the virgins of Israel or the widows of the priests. They may not marry other widows or divorced women. 
26Ezk 44:23 They will teach my people the difference between what is holy and what is common, what is ceremonially clean and unclean.
26Ezk 44:24 °∞They will serve as judges to resolve any disagreements among my people. Their decisions must be based on my regulations. And the priests themselves must obey my instructions and decrees at all the sacred festivals, and see to it that the Sabbaths are set apart as holy days.
26Ezk 44:25 °∞A priest must not defile himself by being in the presence of a dead person unless it is his father, mother, child, brother, or unmarried sister. In such cases it is permitted. 
26Ezk 44:26 Even then, he can return to his Temple duties only after being ceremonially cleansed and then waiting for seven days. 
26Ezk 44:27 The first day he returns to work and enters the inner courtyard and the sanctuary, he must offer a sin offering for himself, says the Sovereign Lord.
26Ezk 44:28 °∞The priests will not have any property or possession of land, for I alone am their special possession. 
26Ezk 44:29 Their food will come from the gifts and sacrifices brought to the Temple by the people - the grain offerings, the sin offerings, and the guilt offerings. Whatever anyone sets apart®Á for the Lord will belong to the priests. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the Lord, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering.
26Ezk 44:30 The first of the ripe fruits and all the gifts brought to the Lord will go to the priests. The first samples of each grain harvest and the first of your flour must also be given to the priests so the Lord will bless your homes. 
26Ezk 44:31 The priests may not eat meat from any bird or animal that dies a natural death or that dies after being attacked by another animal.
26Ezk 45:1 °∞When you divide the land among the tribes of Israel, you must set aside a section for the Lord as his holy portion. This piece of land will be 8 1/3 miles long and 6 2/3 miles wide®Á. The entire area will be holy. / ®ÁReflecting the Greek version, which reads 25,000 cubits [13.3 kilometers] long and 20,000 cubits [10.6 kilometers] wide; Hebrew reads 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits [3 1/3 miles or 5.3 kilometers] wide. Compare 45.3, 5; 48.9.
26Ezk 45:2 A section of this land, measuring 875 feet by 875 feet®Á, will be set aside for the Temple. An additional strip of land 87 1/2 feet®Ë wide is to be left empty all around it. / ®ÁHebrew 500 cubits [265 meters] by 500 cubits, a square. ®ËHebrew 50 cubits [26.5 meters].
26Ezk 45:3 Within the larger sacred area, measure out a portion of land 8 1/3 miles long and 3 1/3 miles wide®Á. Within it the sanctuary of the Most Holy Place will be located. / ®ÁHebrew 25,000 cubits [13.3 kilometers] long and 10,000 cubits [5.3 kilometers] wide; also in 45.5.
26Ezk 45:4 This area will be holy, set aside for the priests who minister to the Lord in the sanctuary. They will use it for their homes, and my Temple will be located within it. 
26Ezk 45:5 The strip of sacred land next to it, also 8 1/3 miles long and 3 1/3 miles wide, will be a living area for the Levites who work at the Temple. It will be their possession and a place for their towns®Á. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads They will have as their possession 20 rooms.
26Ezk 45:6 °∞Adjacent to the larger sacred area will be a section of land 8 1/3 miles long and 1 2/3 miles wide®Á. This will be set aside for a city where anyone in Israel can live. / ®ÁHebrew 25,000 cubits [13.3 kilometers] long and 5,000 cubits [2.65 kilometers] wide.
26Ezk 45:7 °∞Two special sections of land will be set apart for the prince. One section will share a border with the east side of the sacred lands and city, and the second section will share a border on the west side. Then the far eastern and western borders of the prince°Øs lands will line up with the eastern and western boundaries of the tribal areas. 
26Ezk 45:8 These sections of land will be the prince°Øs allotment. Then my princes will no longer oppress and rob my people; they will assign the rest of the land to the people, giving an allotment to each tribe.
26Ezk 45:9 °∞For this is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ Enough, you princes of Israel! Stop your violence and oppression and do what is just and right. Quit robbing and cheating my people out of their land. Stop expelling them from their homes, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 45:10 Use only honest weights and scales and honest measures, both dry and liquid®Á. / ®ÁHebrew use honest scales, an honest ephah, and an honest bath.
26Ezk 45:11 The homer®Á will be your standard unit for measuring volume. The ephah and the bath®Ë will each measure one-tenth of a homer. / ®ÁThe homer measures about 40 gallons or 182 liters. ®ËThe ephah is a dry measure; the bath is a liquid measure.
26Ezk 45:12 The standard unit for weight will be the silver shekel®Á. One shekel will consist of twenty gerahs, and sixty shekels will be equal to one mina®Ë. / ®ÁThe shekel weighs about 0.4 ounces or 11 grams. ®ËElsewhere the mina is equated to 50 shekels.
26Ezk 45:13 °∞You must give this tax to the prince£∫ one bushel of wheat or barley for every 60®Á you harvest, / ®ÁHebrew 1/6 of an ephah from each homer of wheat and 1/6 of an ephah from each homer of barley.
26Ezk 45:14 one percent of your olive oil®Á, / ®ÁHebrew the portion of oil, measured by the bath, is 1/10 of a bath from each cor, which consists of 10 baths or 1 homer, for 10 baths are equivalent to a homer.
26Ezk 45:15 and one sheep or goat for every 200 in your flocks in Israel. These will be the grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings that will make atonement for the people who bring them, says the Sovereign Lord. 
26Ezk 45:16 All the people of Israel must join in bringing these offerings to the prince. 
26Ezk 45:17 The prince will be required to provide offerings that are given at the religious festivals, the new moon celebrations, the Sabbath days, and all other similar occasions. He will provide the sin offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, liquid offerings, and peace offerings to purify the people of Israel, making them right with the Lord®Á. / ®ÁOr to make atonement for the people of Israel.
26Ezk 45:18 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ In early spring, on the first day of each new year®Á, sacrifice a young bull with no defects to purify the Temple. / ®ÁHebrew On the first day of the first month, of the Hebrew calendar. This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in March or April.
26Ezk 45:19 The priest will take blood from this sin offering and put it on the doorposts of the Temple, the four corners of the upper ledge of the altar, and the gateposts at the entrance to the inner courtyard. 
26Ezk 45:20 Do this also on the seventh day of the new year for anyone who has sinned through error or ignorance. In this way, you will purify®Á the Temple. / ®ÁOr will make atonement for.
26Ezk 45:21 °∞On the fourteenth day of the first month®Á, you must celebrate the Passover. This festival will last for seven days. The bread you eat during that time must be made without yeast. / ®ÁThis day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late March, April, or early May.
26Ezk 45:22 On the day of Passover the prince will provide a young bull as a sin offering for himself and the people of Israel. 
26Ezk 45:23 On each of the seven days of the feast he will prepare a burnt offering to the Lord, consisting of seven young bulls and seven rams without defects. A male goat will also be given each day for a sin offering. 
26Ezk 45:24 The prince will provide a basket of flour as a grain offering and a gallon of olive oil®Á with each young bull and ram. / ®ÁHebrew an ephah [20 quarts or 22 liters] of flour . . . and a hin [3.8 liters] of olive oil.
26Ezk 45:25 °∞During the seven days of the Festival of Shelters, which occurs every year in early autumn®Á, the prince will provide these same sacrifices for the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the grain offering, along with the required olive oil. / ®ÁHebrew the festival which begins on the fifteenth day of the seventh month (see Lev 23.33). This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late September, October, or early November.
26Ezk 46:1 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ The east gateway of the inner courtyard will be closed during the six workdays each week, but it will be open on Sabbath days and the days of new moon celebrations. 
26Ezk 46:2 The prince will enter the entry room of the gateway from the outside. Then he will stand by the gatepost while the priest offers his burnt offering and peace offering. He will bow down in worship inside the gateway passage and then go back out the way he came. The gateway will not be closed until evening. 
26Ezk 46:3 The common people will bow down and worship the Lord in front of this gateway on Sabbath days and the days of new moon celebrations.
26Ezk 46:4 °∞Each Sabbath day the prince will present to the Lord a burnt offering of six lambs and one ram, all with no defects. 
26Ezk 46:5 He will present a grain offering of a basket of choice flour to go with the ram and whatever amount of flour he chooses to go with each lamb, and he is to offer one gallon of olive oil®Á for each basket of flour. / ®ÁHebrew an ephah [20 quarts or 22 liters] of choice flour . . . a hin [3.8 liters] of olive oil; similarly in 46.7, 11.
26Ezk 46:6 At the new moon celebrations, he will bring one young bull, six lambs, and one ram, all with no defects. 
26Ezk 46:7 With the young bull he must bring a basket of choice flour for a grain offering. With the ram he must bring another basket of flour. And with each lamb he is to bring whatever amount of flour he chooses to give. With each basket of flour he must offer one gallon of olive oil.
26Ezk 46:8 °∞The prince must enter the gateway through the entry room, and he must leave the same way. 
26Ezk 46:9 But when the people come in through the north gateway to worship the Lord during the religious festivals, they must leave by the south gateway. And those who entered through the south gateway must leave by the north gateway. They must never leave by the same gateway they came in, but must always use the opposite gateway. 
26Ezk 46:10 The prince will enter and leave with the people on these occasions.
26Ezk 46:11 °∞So at the special feasts and sacred festivals, the grain offering will be a basket of choice flour with each young bull, another basket of flour with each ram, and as much flour as the prince chooses to give with each lamb. Give one gallon of olive oil with each basket of flour. 
26Ezk 46:12 When the prince offers a voluntary burnt offering or peace offering to the Lord, the east gateway to the inner courtyard will be opened for him, and he will offer his sacrifices as he does on Sabbath days. Then he will leave, and the gateway will be shut behind him.
26Ezk 46:13 °∞Each morning you must sacrifice a one-year-old lamb with no defects as a burnt offering to the Lord. 
26Ezk 46:14 With the lamb, a grain offering must also be given to the Lord - about three quarts of flour with a third of a gallon of olive oil®Á to moisten the choice flour. This will be a permanent law for you. / ®ÁHebrew 1/6 of an ephah [3.7 liters] of flour with 1/3 of a hin [1.3 liters] of olive oil.
26Ezk 46:15 The lamb, the grain offering, and the olive oil must be given as a daily sacrifice every morning without fail.
26Ezk 46:16 °∞This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ If the prince gives a gift of land to one of his sons as his inheritance, it will belong to him and his descendants forever. 
26Ezk 46:17 But if the prince gives a gift of land from his inheritance to one of his servants, the servant may keep it only until the Year of Jubilee, which comes every fiftieth year®Á. At that time the land will return to the prince. But when the prince gives gifts to his sons, those gifts will be permanent. / ®ÁHebrew until the Year of Release; see Lev 25.8-17.
26Ezk 46:18 And the prince may never take anyone°Øs property by force. If he gives property to his sons, it must be from his own land, for I do not want any of my people unjustly evicted from their property.°±
26Ezk 46:19 In my vision, the man brought me through the entrance beside the gateway and led me to the sacred rooms assigned to the priests, which faced toward the north. He showed me a place at the extreme west end of these rooms. 
26Ezk 46:20 He explained, °∞This is where the priests will cook the meat from the guilt offerings and sin offerings and bake the flour from the grain offerings into bread. They will do it here to avoid carrying the sacrifices through the outer courtyard and endangering the people by transmitting holiness to them.°±
26Ezk 46:21 Then he brought me back to the outer courtyard and led me to each of its four corners. In each corner I saw an enclosure. 
26Ezk 46:22 Each of these enclosures was 70 feet long and 52 1/2 feet wide®Á, surrounded by walls. / ®ÁHebrew 40 cubits [21.2 meters] long and 30 cubits [15.9 meters] wide.
26Ezk 46:23 Along the inside of these walls was a ledge of stone with fireplaces under the ledge all the way around. 
26Ezk 46:24 The man said to me, °∞These are the kitchens to be used by the Temple assistants to boil the sacrifices offered by the people.°±
26Ezk 47:1 In my vision, the man brought me back to the entrance of the Temple. There I saw a stream flowing east from beneath the door of the Temple and passing to the right of the altar on its south side. 
26Ezk 47:2 The man brought me outside the wall through the north gateway and led me around to the eastern entrance. There I could see the water flowing out through the south side of the east gateway.
26Ezk 47:3 Measuring as he went, he took me along the stream for 1,750 feet®Á and then led me across. The water was up to my ankles. / ®ÁHebrew 1,000 cubits [530 meters]; also in 47.4, 5.
26Ezk 47:4 He measured off another 1,750 feet and led me across again. This time the water was up to my knees. After another 1,750 feet, it was up to my waist. 
26Ezk 47:5 Then he measured another 1,750 feet, and the river was too deep to walk across. It was deep enough to swim in, but too deep to walk through.
26Ezk 47:6 He asked me, °∞Have you been watching, son of man?°± Then he led me back along the riverbank. 
26Ezk 47:7 When I returned, I was surprised by the sight of many trees growing on both sides of the river. 
26Ezk 47:8 Then he said to me, °∞This river flows east through the desert into the valley of the Dead Sea®Á. The waters of this stream will make the salty waters of the Dead Sea fresh and pure. / ®ÁHebrew the sea.
26Ezk 47:9 There will be swarms of living things wherever the water of this river flows. Fish will abound in the Dead Sea, for its waters will become fresh. Life will flourish wherever this water flows. 
26Ezk 47:10 Fishermen will stand along the shores of the Dead Sea. All the way from En-gedi to En-eglaim, the shores will be covered with nets drying in the sun. Fish of every kind will fill the Dead Sea, just as they fill the Mediterranean®Á. / ®ÁHebrew the great sea; also in 47.15, 17, 19, 20.
26Ezk 47:11 But the marshes and swamps will not be purified; they will still be salty. 
26Ezk 47:12 Fruit trees of all kinds will grow along both sides of the river. The leaves of these trees will never turn brown and fall, and there will always be fruit on their branches. There will be a new crop every month, for they are watered by the river flowing from the Temple. The fruit will be for food and the leaves for healing.°±
26Ezk 47:13 This is what the Sovereign Lord says£∫ °∞Divide the land in this way for the twelve tribes of Israel£∫ The descendants of Joseph will be given two shares of land®Á. / ®ÁIt was important to retain twelve portions of land. Since Levi had no portion, the descendants of Joseph°Øs sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, received land as two tribes.
26Ezk 47:14 Otherwise each tribe will receive an equal share. I took a solemn oath and swore that I would give this land to your ancestors, and it will now come to you as your possession.
26Ezk 47:15 °∞These are the boundaries of the land£∫ The northern border will run from the Mediterranean toward Hethlon, then on through Lebo-hamath to Zedad; 
26Ezk 47:16 then it will run to Berothah and Sibraim, which are on the border between Damascus and Hamath, and finally to Hazer-hatticon, on the border of Hauran. 
26Ezk 47:17 So the northern border will run from the Mediterranean to Hazar-enan, on the border between Hamath to the north and Damascus to the south.
26Ezk 47:18 °∞The eastern border starts at a point between Hauran and Damascus and runs south along the Jordan River between Israel and Gilead, past the Dead Sea®Á and as far south as Tamar®Ë. This will be the eastern border. / ®ÁHebrew the eastern sea. ®ËAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads you will measure.
26Ezk 47:19 °∞The southern border will go west from Tamar to the waters of Meribah at Kadesh®Á and then follow the course of the Brook of Egypt to the Mediterranean. This will be the southern border. / ®ÁHebrew waters of Meribath-kadesh.
26Ezk 47:20 °∞On the west side, the Mediterranean itself will be your border from the southern border to the point where the northern border begins, opposite Lebo-hamath.
26Ezk 47:21 °∞Divide the land within these boundaries among the tribes of Israel. 
26Ezk 47:22 Distribute the land as an allotment for yourselves and for the foreigners who have joined you and are raising their families among you. They will be like native-born Israelites to you and will receive an allotment among the tribes. 
26Ezk 47:23 These foreigners are to be given land within the territory of the tribe with whom they now live. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!
26Ezk 48:1 °∞Here is the list of the tribes of Israel and the territory each is to receive. The territory of Dan is in the extreme north. Its boundary line follows the Hethlon road to Lebo-hamath and then runs on to Hazar-enan on the border of Damascus, with Hamath to the north. Dan°Øs territory extends all the way across the land of Israel from east to west.
26Ezk 48:2 °∞Asher°Øs territory lies south of Dan°Øs and also extends from east to west. 
26Ezk 48:3 Naphtali°Øs land lies south of Asher°Øs, also extending from east to west. 
26Ezk 48:4 Then comes Manasseh south of Naphtali, and its territory also extends from east to west. 
26Ezk 48:5 South of Manasseh is Ephraim, 
26Ezk 48:6 and then Reuben, 
26Ezk 48:7 and then Judah, all of whose boundaries extend from east to west.
26Ezk 48:8 °∞South of Judah is the land set aside for a special purpose. It will be 8 1/3 miles®Á wide and will extend as far east and west as the tribal territories, with the Temple at the center. / ®ÁHebrew 25,000 cubits [13.3 kilometers].
26Ezk 48:9 °∞The area set aside for the Lord°Øs Temple will be 8 1/3 miles long and 6 2/3 miles wide®Á. / ®ÁReflecting one Greek manuscript and the Greek reading in 45.1£∫ 25,000 cubits [13.3 kilometers] long and 20,000 cubits [10.6 kilometers] wide; Hebrew reads 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits [3 1/3 miles or 5.3 kilometers] wide. Similarly in 48.13b. Compare 45.1-5; 48.10-13.
26Ezk 48:10 For the priests there will be a strip of land measuring 8 1/3 miles long by 3 1/3 miles wide®Á, with the Lord°Øs Temple at the center. / ®ÁHebrew 25,000 cubits [13.3 kilometers] long by 10,000 cubits [5.3 kilometers] wide; also in 48.13a.
26Ezk 48:11 This area is set aside for the ordained priests, the descendants of Zadok who served me faithfully and did not go astray with the people of Israel and the rest of the Levites. 
26Ezk 48:12 It will be their special portion when the land is distributed, the most sacred land of all. Next to the priests°Ø territory will lie the land where the other Levites will live.
26Ezk 48:13 °∞The land allotted to the Levites will be the same size and shape as that belonging to the priests - 8 1/3 miles long and 3 1/3 miles wide. Together these portions of land will measure 8 1/3 miles long by 6 2/3 miles wide®Á. / ®ÁSee note on 48.9.
26Ezk 48:14 None of this special land may ever be sold or traded or used by others, for it belongs to the Lord; it is set apart as holy.
26Ezk 48:15 °∞An additional strip of land 8 1/3 miles long by 1 2/3 miles wide®Á, south of the sacred Temple area, will be allotted for public use - homes, pasturelands, and common lands, with a city at the center. / ®ÁHebrew 25,000 cubits [13.3 kilometers] long by 5,000 cubits [2.65 kilometers] wide.
26Ezk 48:16 The city will measure 1 1/2 miles®Á on each side - north, south, east, and west. / ®ÁHebrew 4,500 cubits [2.4 kilometers]; also in 48.30, 32, 33, 34.
26Ezk 48:17 Open lands will surround the city for 150 yards®Á in every direction. / ®ÁHebrew 250 cubits [133 meters].
26Ezk 48:18 Outside the city there will be a farming area that stretches 3 1/3 miles to the east and 3 1/3 miles to the west®Á along the border of the sacred area. This farmland will produce food for the people working in the city. / ®ÁHebrew 10,000 cubits [5.3 kilometers] to the east and 10,000 cubits to the west.
26Ezk 48:19 Those who come from the various tribes to work in the city may farm it. 
26Ezk 48:20 This entire area - including the sacred lands and the city - is a square that measures 8 1/3 miles®Á on each side. / ®ÁHebrew 25,000 cubits [13.3 kilometers]; also in 48.21.
26Ezk 48:21 °∞The areas that remain, to the east and to the west of the sacred lands and the city, will belong to the prince. Each of these areas will be 8 1/3 miles wide, extending in opposite directions to the eastern and western borders of Israel, with the sacred lands and the sanctuary of the Temple in the center. 
26Ezk 48:22 So the prince°Øs land will include everything between the territories allotted to Judah and Benjamin, except for the areas set aside for the sacred lands and the city.
26Ezk 48:23 °∞These are the territories allotted to the rest of the tribes. Benjamin°Øs territory lies just south of the prince°Øs lands, and it extends across the entire land of Israel from east to west. 
26Ezk 48:24 South of Benjamin°Øs territory lies that of Simeon, also extending across the land from east to west.

26Ezk 48:26 °∞Then comes the territory of Zebulun, which also extends across the land from east to west. 
26Ezk 48:27 The territory of Gad is just south of Zebulun with the same borders to the east and west.

27Dn 1:1 During the third year of King Jehoiakim°Øs reign in Judah®Á, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and besieged it. / ®ÁThis event occurred in 605 b.c., during the third year of Jehoiakim°Øs reign (according to the calendar system in which the new year begins in the spring).
27Dn 1:2 The Lord gave him victory over King Jehoiakim of Judah and permitted him to take some of the sacred objects from the Temple of God. So Nebuchadnezzar took them back to the land of Babylonia®Á and placed them in the treasure-house of his god. / ®ÁHebrew the land of Shinar.
27Dn 1:3 Then the king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief of staff, to bring to the palace some of the young men of Judah°Øs royal family and other noble families, who had been brought to Babylon as captives. 
27Dn 1:4 °∞Select only strong, healthy, and good-looking young men,°± he said. °∞Make sure they are well versed in every branch of learning, are gifted with knowledge and good judgment, and are suited to serve in the royal palace. Train these young men in the language and literature of Babylon®Á.°± / ®ÁOr of the Chaldeans.
27Dn 1:5 The king assigned them a daily ration of food and wine from his own kitchens. They were to be trained for three years, and then they would enter the royal service.
27Dn 1:6 Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah were four of the young men chosen, all from the tribe of Judah. 
27Dn 1:7 The chief of staff renamed them with these Babylonian names£∫ Daniel was called Belteshazzar. Hananiah was called Shadrach. Mishael was called Meshach. Azariah was called Abednego.
27Dn 1:8 But Daniel was determined not to defile himself by eating the food and wine given to them by the king. He asked the chief of staff for permission not to eat these unacceptable foods. 
27Dn 1:9 Now God had given the chief of staff both respect and affection for Daniel. 
27Dn 1:10 But he responded, °∞I am afraid of my lord the king, who has ordered that you eat this food and wine. If you become pale and thin compared to the other youths your age, I am afraid the king will have me beheaded.°±
27Dn 1:11 Daniel spoke with the attendant who had been appointed by the chief of staff to look after Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. 
27Dn 1:12 °∞Please test us for ten days on a diet of vegetables and water,°± Daniel said. 
27Dn 1:13 °∞At the end of the ten days, see how we look compared to the other young men who are eating the king°Øs food. Then make your decision in light of what you see.°± 
27Dn 1:14 The attendant agreed to Daniel°Øs suggestion and tested them for ten days.
27Dn 1:15 At the end of the ten days, Daniel and his three friends looked healthier and better nourished than the young men who had been eating the food assigned by the king. 
27Dn 1:16 So after that, the attendant fed them only vegetables instead of the food and wine provided for the others.
27Dn 1:17 God gave these four young men an unusual aptitude for understanding every aspect of literature and wisdom. And God gave Daniel the special ability to interpret the meanings of visions and dreams.
27Dn 1:18 When the training period ordered by the king was completed, the chief of staff brought all the young men to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
27Dn 1:19 The king talked with them, and no one impressed him as much as Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah. So they entered the royal service. 
27Dn 1:20 Whenever the king consulted them in any matter requiring wisdom and balanced judgment, he found them ten times more capable than any of the magicians and enchanters in his entire kingdom.
27Dn 1:21 Daniel remained in the royal service until the first year of the reign of King Cyrus®Á. / ®ÁCyrus began his reign (over Babylon) in 539 b.c.
27Dn 2:1 One night during the second year of his reign®Á, Nebuchadnezzar had such disturbing dreams that he couldn°Øt sleep. / ®ÁThe second year of Nebuchadnezzar°Øs reign was 603 b.c.
27Dn 2:2 He called in his magicians, enchanters, sorcerers, and astrologers®Á, and he demanded that they tell him what he had dreamed. As they stood before the king, / ®ÁOr Chaldeans; also in 2.4, 5, 10.
27Dn 2:3 he said, °∞I have had a dream that deeply troubles me, and I must know what it means.°±
27Dn 2:4 Then the astrologers answered the king in Aramaic®Á, °∞Long live the king! Tell us the dream, and we will tell you what it means.°± / ®ÁThe original text from this point through chapter 7 is in Aramaic.
27Dn 2:5 But the king said to the astrologers, °∞I am serious about this. If you don°Øt tell me what my dream was and what it means, you will be torn limb from limb, and your houses will be turned into heaps of rubble! 
27Dn 2:6 But if you tell me what I dreamed and what the dream means, I will give you many wonderful gifts and honors. Just tell me the dream and what it means!°±
27Dn 2:7 They said again, °∞Please, Your Majesty. Tell us the dream, and we will tell you what it means.°±
27Dn 2:8 The king replied, °∞I know what you are doing! You°Øre stalling for time because you know I am serious when I say, 
27Dn 2:9 °ÆIf you don°Øt tell me the dream, you are doomed.°Ø So you have conspired to tell me lies, hoping I will change my mind. But tell me the dream, and then I°Øll know that you can tell me what it means.°±
27Dn 2:10 The astrologers replied to the king, °∞No one on earth can tell the king his dream! And no king, however great and powerful, has ever asked such a thing of any magician, enchanter, or astrologer! 
27Dn 2:11 The king°Øs demand is impossible. No one except the gods can tell you your dream, and they do not live here among people.°±
27Dn 2:12 The king was furious when he heard this, and he ordered that all the wise men of Babylon be executed. 
27Dn 2:13 And because of the king°Øs decree, men were sent to find and kill Daniel and his friends.
27Dn 2:14 When Arioch, the commander of the king°Øs guard, came to kill them, Daniel handled the situation with wisdom and discretion. 
27Dn 2:15 He asked Arioch, °∞Why has the king issued such a harsh decree?°± So Arioch told him all that had happened. 
27Dn 2:16 Daniel went at once to see the king and requested more time to tell the king what the dream meant.
27Dn 2:17 Then Daniel went home and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah what had happened. 
27Dn 2:18 He urged them to ask the God of heaven to show them his mercy by telling them the secret, so they would not be executed along with the other wise men of Babylon. 
27Dn 2:19 That night the secret was revealed to Daniel in a vision. Then Daniel praised the God of heaven. 
27Dn 2:20 He said, °∞Praise the name of God forever and ever, for he has all wisdom and power.
27Dn 2:21 He controls the course of world events; he removes kings and sets up other kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the scholars.
27Dn 2:22 He reveals deep and mysterious things and knows what lies hidden in darkness, though he is surrounded by light.
27Dn 2:23 I thank and praise you, God of my ancestors, for you have given me wisdom and strength. You have told me what we asked of you and revealed to us what the king demanded.°±
27Dn 2:24 Then Daniel went in to see Arioch, whom the king had ordered to execute the wise men of Babylon. Daniel said to him, °∞Don°Øt kill the wise men. Take me to the king, and I will tell him the meaning of his dream.°±
27Dn 2:25 Arioch quickly took Daniel to the king and said, °∞I have found one of the captives from Judah who will tell the king the meaning of his dream!°±
27Dn 2:26 The king said to Daniel (also known as Belteshazzar), °∞Is this true? Can you tell me what my dream was and what it means?°±
27Dn 2:27 Daniel replied, °∞There are no wise men, enchanters, magicians, or fortune-tellers who can reveal the king°Øs secret. 
27Dn 2:28 But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he has shown King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the future. Now I will tell you your dream and the visions you saw as you lay on your bed.
27Dn 2:29 °∞While Your Majesty was sleeping, you dreamed about coming events. He who reveals secrets has shown you what is going to happen. 
27Dn 2:30 And it is not because I am wiser than anyone else that I know the secret of your dream, but because God wants you to understand what was in your heart.
27Dn 2:31 °∞In your vision, Your Majesty, you saw standing before you a huge, shining statue of a man. It was a frightening sight. 
27Dn 2:32 The head of the statue was made of fine gold. Its chest and arms were silver, its belly and thighs were bronze, 
27Dn 2:33 its legs were iron, and its feet were a combination of iron and baked clay. 
27Dn 2:34 As you watched, a rock was cut from a mountain, but not by human hands. It struck the feet of iron and clay, smashing them to bits. 
27Dn 2:35 The whole statue was crushed into small pieces of iron, clay, bronze, silver, and gold. Then the wind blew them away without a trace, like chaff on a threshing floor. But the rock that knocked the statue down became a great mountain that covered the whole earth.
27Dn 2:36 °∞That was the dream. Now we will tell the king what it means. 
27Dn 2:37 Your Majesty, you are the greatest of kings. The God of heaven has given you sovereignty, power, strength, and honor. 
27Dn 2:38 He has made you the ruler over all the inhabited world and has put even the wild animals and birds under your control. You are the head of gold.
27Dn 2:39 °∞But after your kingdom comes to an end, another kingdom, inferior to yours, will rise to take your place. After that kingdom has fallen, yet a third kingdom, represented by bronze, will rise to rule the world. 
27Dn 2:40 Following that kingdom, there will be a fourth one, as strong as iron. That kingdom will smash and crush all previous empires, just as iron smashes and crushes everything it strikes. 
27Dn 2:41 The feet and toes you saw were a combination of iron and baked clay, showing that this kingdom will be divided. Like iron mixed with clay, it will have some of the strength of iron. 
27Dn 2:42 But while some parts of it will be as strong as iron, other parts will be as weak as clay. 
27Dn 2:43 This mixture of iron and clay also shows that these kingdoms will try to strengthen themselves by forming alliances with each other through intermarriage. But they will not hold together, just as iron and clay do not mix.
27Dn 2:44 °∞During the reigns of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed or conquered. It will crush all these kingdoms into nothingness, and it will stand forever. 
27Dn 2:45 That is the meaning of the rock cut from the mountain, though not by human hands, that crushed to pieces the statue of iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold. The great God was showing the king what will happen in the future. The dream is true, and its meaning is certain.°±
27Dn 2:46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar threw himself down before Daniel and worshiped him, and he commanded his people to offer sacrifices and burn sweet incense before him. 
27Dn 2:47 The king said to Daniel, °∞Truly, your God is the greatest of gods, the Lord over kings, a revealer of mysteries, for you have been able to reveal this secret.°±
27Dn 2:48 Then the king appointed Daniel to a high position and gave him many valuable gifts. He made Daniel ruler over the whole province of Babylon, as well as chief over all his wise men. 
27Dn 2:49 At Daniel°Øs request, the king appointed Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to be in charge of all the affairs of the province of Babylon, while Daniel remained in the king°Øs court.
27Dn 3:1 King Nebuchadnezzar made a gold statue ninety feet tall and nine feet wide®Á and set it up on the plain of Dura in the province of Babylon. / ®ÁAramaic 60 cubits [27 meters] tall and 6 cubits [2.7 meters] wide.
27Dn 3:2 Then he sent messages to the high officers, officials, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the provincial officials to come to the dedication of the statue he had set up. 
27Dn 3:3 So all these officials®Á came and stood before the statue King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. / ®ÁAramaic the high officers, officials, governors, advisers, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all the provincial officials.
27Dn 3:4 Then a herald shouted out, °∞People of all races and nations and languages, listen to the king°Øs command! 
27Dn 3:5 When you hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and other musical instruments®Á, bow to the ground to worship King Nebuchadnezzar°Øs gold statue. / ®ÁThe identification of some of these musical instruments is uncertain.
27Dn 3:6 Anyone who refuses to obey will immediately be thrown into a blazing furnace.°±
27Dn 3:7 So at the sound of the musical instruments®Á, all the people, whatever their race or nation or language, bowed to the ground and worshiped the gold statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up. / ®ÁAramaic the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, and other musical instruments.
27Dn 3:8 But some of the astrologers®Á went to the king and informed on the Jews. / ®ÁAramaic Chaldeans.
27Dn 3:9 They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, °∞Long live the king! 
27Dn 3:10 You issued a decree requiring all the people to bow down and worship the gold statue when they hear the sound of the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and other musical instruments. 
27Dn 3:11 That decree also states that those who refuse to obey must be thrown into a blazing furnace. 
27Dn 3:12 But there are some Jews - Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego - whom you have put in charge of the province of Babylon. They pay no attention to you, Your Majesty. They refuse to serve your gods and do not worship the gold statue you have set up.°±
27Dn 3:13 Then Nebuchadnezzar flew into a rage and ordered that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought before him. When they were brought in, 
27Dn 3:14 Nebuchadnezzar said to them, °∞Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you refuse to serve my gods or to worship the gold statue I have set up? 
27Dn 3:15 I will give you one more chance to bow down and worship the statue I have made when you hear the sound of the musical instruments®Á. But if you refuse, you will be thrown immediately into the blazing furnace. And then what god will be able to rescue you from my power?°± / ®ÁAramaic the horn, flute, zither, lyre, harp, pipes, and other musical instruments.
27Dn 3:16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego replied, °∞O Nebuchadnezzar, we do not need to defend ourselves before you. 
27Dn 3:17 If we are thrown into the blazing furnace, the God whom we serve is able to save us. He will rescue us from your power, Your Majesty. 
27Dn 3:18 But even if he doesn°Øt, we want to make it clear to you, Your Majesty, that we will never serve your gods or worship the gold statue you have set up.°±
27Dn 3:19 Nebuchadnezzar was so furious with Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that his face became distorted with rage. He commanded that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual. 
27Dn 3:20 Then he ordered some of the strongest men of his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego and throw them into the blazing furnace. 
27Dn 3:21 So they tied them up and threw them into the furnace, fully dressed in their pants, turbans, robes, and other garments. 
27Dn 3:22 And because the king, in his anger, had demanded such a hot fire in the furnace, the flames killed the soldiers as they threw the three men in. 
27Dn 3:23 So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, securely tied, fell into the roaring flames.
27Dn 3:24 But suddenly, Nebuchadnezzar jumped up in amazement and exclaimed to his advisers, °∞Didn°Øt we tie up three men and throw them into the furnace?°± °∞Yes, Your Majesty, we certainly did,°± they replied.
27Dn 3:25 °∞Look!°± Nebuchadnezzar shouted. °∞I see four men, unbound, walking around in the fire unharmed! And the fourth looks like a god®Á!°± / ®ÁAramaic like a son of the gods.
27Dn 3:26 Then Nebuchadnezzar came as close as he could to the door of the flaming furnace and shouted£∫ °∞Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out! Come here!°± So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stepped out of the fire. 
27Dn 3:27 Then the high officers, officials, governors, and advisers crowded around them and saw that the fire had not touched them. Not a hair on their heads was singed, and their clothing was not scorched. They didn°Øt even smell of smoke!
27Dn 3:28 Then Nebuchadnezzar said, °∞Praise to the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego! He sent his angel to rescue his servants who trusted in him. They defied the king°Øs command and were willing to die rather than serve or worship any god except their own God. 
27Dn 3:29 Therefore, I make this decree£∫ If any people, whatever their race or nation or language, speak a word against the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, they will be torn limb from limb, and their houses will be turned into heaps of rubble. There is no other god who can rescue like this!°±
27Dn 3:30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego to even higher positions in the province of Babylon.
27Dn 4:1 ®ÁKing Nebuchadnezzar sent this message to the people of every race and nation and language throughout the world£∫ °∞Peace and prosperity to you! / ®ÁVerses 4.1-3 are numbered 3.31-33 in Aramaic text.
27Dn 4:2 °∞I want you all to know about the miraculous signs and wonders the Most High God has performed for me.
27Dn 4:3 How great are his signs, how powerful his wonders! His kingdom will last forever, his rule through all generations.
27Dn 4:4 ®Á°∞I, Nebuchadnezzar, was living in my palace in comfort and prosperity. / ®ÁVerses 4.4-37 are numbered 4.1-34 in Aramaic text.
27Dn 4:5 But one night I had a dream that frightened me; I saw visions that terrified me as I lay in my bed. 
27Dn 4:6 So I issued an order calling in all the wise men of Babylon, so they could tell me what my dream meant. 
27Dn 4:7 When all the magicians, enchanters, astrologers®Á, and fortune-tellers came in, I told them the dream, but they could not tell me what it meant. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans.
27Dn 4:8 At last Daniel came in before me, and I told him the dream. (He was named Belteshazzar after my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is in him.)
27Dn 4:9 °∞I said to him, °ÆBelteshazzar, chief of the magicians, I know that the spirit of the holy gods is in you and that no mystery is too great for you to solve. Now tell me what my dream means.
27Dn 4:10 °∞°ÆWhile I was lying in my bed, this is what I dreamed. I saw a large tree in the middle of the earth. 
27Dn 4:11 The tree grew very tall and strong, reaching high into the heavens for all the world to see. 
27Dn 4:12 It had fresh green leaves, and it was loaded with fruit for all to eat. Wild animals lived in its shade, and birds nested in its branches. All the world was fed from this tree.
27Dn 4:13 °∞°ÆThen as I lay there dreaming, I saw a messenger®Á, a holy one, coming down from heaven. / ®ÁAramaic a watcher; also in 4.23.
27Dn 4:14 The messenger shouted, °∞Cut down the tree and lop off its branches! Shake off its leaves and scatter its fruit! Chase the wild animals from its shade and the birds from its branches.
27Dn 4:15 But leave the stump and the roots in the ground, bound with a band of iron and bronze and surrounded by tender grass. Now let him be drenched with the dew of heaven, and let him live with the wild animals among the plants of the field.
27Dn 4:16 For seven periods of time, let him have the mind of a wild animal instead of the mind of a human.
27Dn 4:17 For this has been decreed by the messengers®Á; it is commanded by the holy ones, so that everyone may know that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of the world. He gives them to anyone he chooses - even to the lowliest of people.°± / ®ÁAramaic the watchers.
27Dn 4:18 °∞°ÆBelteshazzar, that was the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, had. Now tell me what it means, for none of the wise men of my kingdom can do so. But you can tell me because the spirit of the holy gods is in you.°Ø
27Dn 4:19 °∞Upon hearing this, Daniel (also known as Belteshazzar) was overcome for a time, frightened by the meaning of the dream. Then the king said to him, °ÆBelteshazzar, don°Øt be alarmed by the dream and what it means.°Ø °∞Belteshazzar replied, °ÆI wish the events foreshadowed in this dream would happen to your enemies, my lord, and not to you! 
27Dn 4:20 The tree you saw was growing very tall and strong, reaching high into the heavens for all the world to see. 
27Dn 4:21 It had fresh green leaves and was loaded with fruit for all to eat. Wild animals lived in its shade, and birds nested in its branches. 
27Dn 4:22 That tree, Your Majesty, is you. For you have grown strong and great; your greatness reaches up to heaven, and your rule to the ends of the earth.
27Dn 4:23 °∞°ÆThen you saw a messenger, a holy one, coming down from heaven and saying, °∞Cut down the tree and destroy it. But leave the stump and the roots in the ground, bound with a band of iron and bronze and surrounded by tender grass. Let him be drenched with the dew of heaven. Let him live with the animals of the field for seven periods of time.°±
27Dn 4:24 °∞°ÆThis is what the dream means, Your Majesty, and what the Most High has declared will happen to my lord the king. 
27Dn 4:25 You will be driven from human society, and you will live in the fields with the wild animals. You will eat grass like a cow, and you will be drenched with the dew of heaven. Seven periods of time will pass while you live this way, until you learn that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of the world and gives them to anyone he chooses. 
27Dn 4:26 But the stump and roots of the tree were left in the ground. This means that you will receive your kingdom back again when you have learned that heaven rules.
27Dn 4:27 °∞°ÆKing Nebuchadnezzar, please accept my advice. Stop sinning and do what is right. Break from your wicked past and be merciful to the poor. Perhaps then you will continue to prosper.°Ø
27Dn 4:28 °∞But all these things did happen to King Nebuchadnezzar. 
27Dn 4:29 Twelve months later he was taking a walk on the flat roof of the royal palace in Babylon. 
27Dn 4:30 As he looked out across the city, he said, °ÆLook at this great city of Babylon! By my own mighty power, I have built this beautiful city as my royal residence to display my majestic splendor.°Ø
27Dn 4:31 °∞While these words were still in his mouth, a voice called down from heaven, °ÆO King Nebuchadnezzar, this message is for you! You are no longer ruler of this kingdom. 
27Dn 4:32 You will be driven from human society. You will live in the fields with the wild animals, and you will eat grass like a cow. Seven periods of time will pass while you live this way, until you learn that the Most High rules over the kingdoms of the world and gives them to anyone he chooses.°Ø
27Dn 4:33 °∞That same hour the judgment was fulfilled, and Nebuchadnezzar was driven from human society. He ate grass like a cow, and he was drenched with the dew of heaven. He lived this way until his hair was as long as eagles°Ø feathers and his nails were like birds°Ø claws.
27Dn 4:34 °∞After this time had passed, I, Nebuchadnezzar, looked up to heaven. My sanity returned, and I praised and worshiped the Most High and honored the one who lives forever. His rule is everlasting, and his kingdom is eternal.
27Dn 4:35 All the people of the earth are nothing compared to him. He does as he pleases among the angels of heaven and among the people of the earth. No one can stop him or say to him, °ÆWhat do you mean by doing these things?°Ø
27Dn 4:36 °∞When my sanity returned to me, so did my honor and glory and kingdom. My advisers and nobles sought me out, and I was restored as head of my kingdom, with even greater honor than before.
27Dn 4:37 °∞Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and glorify and honor the King of heaven. All his acts are just and true, and he is able to humble the proud.°±
27Dn 5:1 Many years later King Belshazzar gave a great feast for 1,000 of his nobles, and he drank wine with them. 
27Dn 5:2 While Belshazzar was drinking the wine, he gave orders to bring in the gold and silver cups that his predecessor®Á, Nebuchadnezzar, had taken from the Temple in Jerusalem. He wanted to drink from them with his nobles, his wives, and his concubines. / ®ÁAramaic father; also in 5.11, 13, 18.
27Dn 5:3 So they brought these gold cups taken from the Temple, the house of God in Jerusalem, and the king and his nobles, his wives, and his concubines drank from them. 
27Dn 5:4 While they drank from them they praised their idols made of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
27Dn 5:5 Suddenly, they saw the fingers of a human hand writing on the plaster wall of the king°Øs palace, near the lampstand. The king himself saw the hand as it wrote, 
27Dn 5:6 and his face turned pale with fright. His knees knocked together in fear and his legs gave way beneath him.
27Dn 5:7 The king shouted for the enchanters, astrologers®Á, and fortune-tellers to be brought before him. He said to these wise men of Babylon, °∞Whoever can read this writing and tell me what it means will be dressed in purple robes of royal honor and will have a gold chain placed around his neck. He will become the third highest ruler in the kingdom!°± / ®ÁOr Chaldeans; also in 5.11.
27Dn 5:8 But when all the king°Øs wise men had come in, none of them could read the writing or tell him what it meant. 
27Dn 5:9 So the king grew even more alarmed, and his face turned pale. His nobles, too, were shaken.
27Dn 5:10 But when the queen mother heard what was happening, she hurried to the banquet hall. She said to Belshazzar, °∞Long live the king! Don°Øt be so pale and frightened. 
27Dn 5:11 There is a man in your kingdom who has within him the spirit of the holy gods. During Nebuchadnezzar°Øs reign, this man was found to have insight, understanding, and wisdom like that of the gods. Your predecessor, the king - your predecessor King Nebuchadnezzar - made him chief over all the magicians, enchanters, astrologers, and fortune-tellers of Babylon. 
27Dn 5:12 This man Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar, has exceptional ability and is filled with divine knowledge and understanding. He can interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems. Call for Daniel, and he will tell you what the writing means.°±
27Dn 5:13 So Daniel was brought in before the king. The king asked him, °∞Are you Daniel, one of the exiles brought from Judah by my predecessor, King Nebuchadnezzar? 
27Dn 5:14 I have heard that you have the spirit of the gods within you and that you are filled with insight, understanding, and wisdom. 
27Dn 5:15 My wise men and enchanters have tried to read the words on the wall and tell me their meaning, but they cannot do it. 
27Dn 5:16 I am told that you can give interpretations and solve difficult problems. If you can read these words and tell me their meaning, you will be clothed in purple robes of royal honor, and you will have a gold chain placed around your neck. You will become the third highest ruler in the kingdom.°±
27Dn 5:17 Daniel answered the king, °∞Keep your gifts or give them to someone else, but I will tell you what the writing means. 
27Dn 5:18 Your Majesty, the Most High God gave sovereignty, majesty, glory, and honor to your predecessor, Nebuchadnezzar. 
27Dn 5:19 He made him so great that people of all races and nations and languages trembled before him in fear. He killed those he wanted to kill and spared those he wanted to spare. He honored those he wanted to honor and disgraced those he wanted to disgrace. 
27Dn 5:20 But when his heart and mind were puffed up with arrogance, he was brought down from his royal throne and stripped of his glory. 
27Dn 5:21 He was driven from human society. He was given the mind of a wild animal, and he lived among the wild donkeys. He ate grass like a cow, and he was drenched with the dew of heaven, until he learned that the Most High God rules over the kingdoms of the world and appoints anyone he desires to rule over them.
27Dn 5:22 °∞You are his successor®Á, O Belshazzar, and you knew all this, yet you have not humbled yourself. / ®ÁAramaic son.
27Dn 5:23 For you have proudly defied the Lord of heaven and have had these cups from his Temple brought before you. You and your nobles and your wives and concubines have been drinking wine from them while praising gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone - gods that neither see nor hear nor know anything at all. But you have not honored the God who gives you the breath of life and controls your destiny! 
27Dn 5:24 So God has sent this hand to write this message.
27Dn 5:25 °∞This is the message that was written£∫ Mene, Mene, Tekel, and Parsin. 
27Dn 5:26 This is what these words mean£∫ Mene means °Ænumbered°Ø - God has numbered the days of your reign and has brought it to an end.
27Dn 5:27 Tekel means °Æweighed°Ø - you have been weighed on the balances and have not measured up.
27Dn 5:28 Parsin®Á means °Ædivided°Ø - your kingdom has been divided and given to the Medes and Persians.°± / ®ÁAramaic Peres, the singular of Parsin.
27Dn 5:29 Then at Belshazzar°Øs command, Daniel was dressed in purple robes, a gold chain was hung around his neck, and he was proclaimed the third highest ruler in the kingdom.
27Dn 5:30 That very night Belshazzar, the Babylonian®Á king, was killed®Ë. / ®ÁOr Chaldean. ®ËThe Persians and Medes conquered Babylon in October 539 b.c.
27Dn 5:31 ®ÁAnd Darius the Mede took over the kingdom at the age of sixty-two. / ®ÁVerse 5.31 is numbered 6.1 in Aramaic text.
27Dn 6:1 ®ÁDarius the Mede decided to divide the kingdom into 120 provinces, and he appointed a high officer to rule over each province. / ®ÁVerses 6.1-28 are numbered 6.2-29 in Aramaic text.
27Dn 6:2 The king also chose Daniel and two others as administrators to supervise the high officers and protect the king°Øs interests. 
27Dn 6:3 Daniel soon proved himself more capable than all the other administrators and high officers. Because of Daniel°Øs great ability, the king made plans to place him over the entire empire.
27Dn 6:4 Then the other administrators and high officers began searching for some fault in the way Daniel was handling government affairs, but they couldn°Øt find anything to criticize or condemn. He was faithful, always responsible, and completely trustworthy. 
27Dn 6:5 So they concluded, °∞Our only chance of finding grounds for accusing Daniel will be in connection with the rules of his religion.°±
27Dn 6:6 So the administrators and high officers went to the king and said, °∞Long live King Darius! 
27Dn 6:7 We are all in agreement - we administrators, officials, high officers, advisers, and governors - that the king should make a law that will be strictly enforced. Give orders that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone, divine or human - except to you, Your Majesty - will be thrown into the den of lions. 
27Dn 6:8 And now, Your Majesty, issue and sign this law so it cannot be changed, an official law of the Medes and Persians that cannot be revoked.°± 
27Dn 6:9 So King Darius signed the law.
27Dn 6:10 But when Daniel learned that the law had been signed, he went home and knelt down as usual in his upstairs room, with its windows open toward Jerusalem. He prayed three times a day, just as he had always done, giving thanks to his God. 
27Dn 6:11 Then the officials went together to Daniel°Øs house and found him praying and asking for God°Øs help. 
27Dn 6:12 So they went straight to the king and reminded him about his law. °∞Did you not sign a law that for the next thirty days any person who prays to anyone, divine or human - except to you, Your Majesty - will be thrown into the den of lions?°± °∞Yes,°± the king replied, °∞that decision stands; it is an official law of the Medes and Persians that cannot be revoked.°±
27Dn 6:13 Then they told the king, °∞That man Daniel, one of the captives from Judah, is ignoring you and your law. He still prays to his God three times a day.°±
27Dn 6:14 Hearing this, the king was deeply troubled, and he tried to think of a way to save Daniel. He spent the rest of the day looking for a way to get Daniel out of this predicament.
27Dn 6:15 In the evening the men went together to the king and said, °∞Your Majesty, you know that according to the law of the Medes and the Persians, no law that the king signs can be changed.°±
27Dn 6:16 So at last the king gave orders for Daniel to be arrested and thrown into the den of lions. The king said to him, °∞May your God, whom you serve so faithfully, rescue you.°±
27Dn 6:17 A stone was brought and placed over the mouth of the den. The king sealed the stone with his own royal seal and the seals of his nobles, so that no one could rescue Daniel. 
27Dn 6:18 Then the king returned to his palace and spent the night fasting. He refused his usual entertainment and couldn°Øt sleep at all that night.
27Dn 6:19 Very early the next morning, the king got up and hurried out to the lions°Ø den. 
27Dn 6:20 When he got there, he called out in anguish, °∞Daniel, servant of the living God! Was your God, whom you serve so faithfully, able to rescue you from the lions?°±
27Dn 6:21 Daniel answered, °∞Long live the king! 
27Dn 6:22 My God sent his angel to shut the lions°Ø mouths so that they would not hurt me, for I have been found innocent in his sight. And I have not wronged you, Your Majesty.°±
27Dn 6:23 The king was overjoyed and ordered that Daniel be lifted from the den. Not a scratch was found on him, for he had trusted in his God.
27Dn 6:24 Then the king gave orders to arrest the men who had maliciously accused Daniel. He had them thrown into the lions°Ø den, along with their wives and children. The lions leaped on them and tore them apart before they even hit the floor of the den.
27Dn 6:25 Then King Darius sent this message to the people of every race and nation and language throughout the world£∫ °∞Peace and prosperity to you!
27Dn 6:26 °∞I decree that everyone throughout my kingdom should tremble with fear before the God of Daniel. For he is the living God, and he will endure forever. His kingdom will never be destroyed, and his rule will never end.
27Dn 6:27 He rescues and saves his people; he performs miraculous signs and wonders in the heavens and on earth. He has rescued Daniel from the power of the lions.°±
27Dn 6:28 So Daniel prospered during the reign of Darius and the reign of Cyrus the Persian®Á. / ®ÁOr of Darius, that is, the reign of Cyrus the Persian.
27Dn 7:1 Earlier, during the first year of King Belshazzar°Øs reign in Babylon®Á, Daniel had a dream and saw visions as he lay in his bed. He wrote down the dream, and this is what he saw. / ®ÁThe first year of Belshazzar°Øs reign (who was co-regent with his father, Nabonidus) was 556 b.c. (or perhaps as late as 553 b.c.).
27Dn 7:2 In my vision that night, I, Daniel, saw a great storm churning the surface of a great sea, with strong winds blowing from every direction. 
27Dn 7:3 Then four huge beasts came up out of the water, each different from the others.
27Dn 7:4 The first beast was like a lion with eagles°Ø wings. As I watched, its wings were pulled off, and it was left standing with its two hind feet on the ground, like a human being. And it was given a human mind.
27Dn 7:5 Then I saw a second beast, and it looked like a bear. It was rearing up on one side, and it had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth. And I heard a voice saying to it, °∞Get up! Devour the flesh of many people!°±
27Dn 7:6 Then the third of these strange beasts appeared, and it looked like a leopard. It had four bird°Øs wings on its back, and it had four heads. Great authority was given to this beast.
27Dn 7:7 Then in my vision that night, I saw a fourth beast - terrifying, dreadful, and very strong. It devoured and crushed its victims with huge iron teeth and trampled their remains beneath its feet. It was different from any of the other beasts, and it had ten horns.
27Dn 7:8 As I was looking at the horns, suddenly another small horn appeared among them. Three of the first horns were torn out by the roots to make room for it. This little horn had eyes like human eyes and a mouth that was boasting arrogantly.
27Dn 7:9 I watched as thrones were put in place and the Ancient One®Á sat down to judge. His clothing was as white as snow, his hair like purest wool. He sat on a fiery throne with wheels of blazing fire, / ®ÁAramaic an Ancient of Days; also in 7.13, 22.
27Dn 7:10 and a river of fire was pouring out, flowing from his presence. Millions of angels ministered to him; many millions stood to attend him. Then the court began its session, and the books were opened.
27Dn 7:11 I continued to watch because I could hear the little horn°Øs boastful speech. I kept watching until the fourth beast was killed and its body was destroyed by fire. 
27Dn 7:12 The other three beasts had their authority taken from them, but they were allowed to live a while longer®Á. / ®ÁAramaic for a season and a time.
27Dn 7:13 As my vision continued that night, I saw someone like a son of man®Á coming with the clouds of heaven. He approached the Ancient One and was led into his presence. / ®ÁOr like a Son of Man.
27Dn 7:14 He was given authority, honor, and sovereignty over all the nations of the world, so that people of every race and nation and language would obey him. His rule is eternal - it will never end. His kingdom will never be destroyed.
27Dn 7:15 I, Daniel, was troubled by all I had seen, and my visions terrified me. 
27Dn 7:16 So I approached one of those standing beside the throne and asked him what it all meant. He explained it to me like this£∫ 
27Dn 7:17 °∞These four huge beasts represent four kingdoms that will arise from the earth. 
27Dn 7:18 But in the end, the holy people of the Most High will be given the kingdom, and they will rule forever and ever.°±
27Dn 7:19 Then I wanted to know the true meaning of the fourth beast, the one so different from the others and so terrifying. It had devoured and crushed its victims with iron teeth and bronze claws, trampling their remains beneath its feet. 
27Dn 7:20 I also asked about the ten horns on the fourth beast°Øs head and the little horn that came up afterward and destroyed three of the other horns. This horn had seemed greater than the others, and it had human eyes and a mouth that was boasting arrogantly. 
27Dn 7:21 As I watched, this horn was waging war against God°Øs holy people and was defeating them, 
27Dn 7:22 until the Ancient One - the Most High - came and judged in favor of his holy people. Then the time arrived for the holy people to take over the kingdom.
27Dn 7:23 Then he said to me, °∞This fourth beast is the fourth world power that will rule the earth. It will be different from all the others. It will devour the whole world, trampling and crushing everything in its path. 
27Dn 7:24 Its ten horns are ten kings who will rule that empire. Then another king will arise, different from the other ten, who will subdue three of them. 
27Dn 7:25 He will defy the Most High and oppress the holy people of the Most High. He will try to change their sacred festivals and laws, and they will be placed under his control for a time, times, and half a time.
27Dn 7:26 °∞But then the court will pass judgment, and all his power will be taken away and completely destroyed. 
27Dn 7:27 Then the sovereignty, power, and greatness of all the kingdoms under heaven will be given to the holy people of the Most High. His kingdom will last forever, and all rulers will serve and obey him.°±
27Dn 7:28 That was the end of the vision. I, Daniel, was terrified by my thoughts and my face was pale with fear, but I kept these things to myself.
27Dn 8:1 ®ÁDuring the third year of King Belshazzar°Øs reign, I, Daniel, saw another vision, following the one that had already appeared to me. / ®ÁThe original text from this point through chapter 12 is in Hebrew. See note at 2.4.
27Dn 8:2 In this vision I was at the fortress of Susa, in the province of Elam, standing beside the Ulai River®Á. / ®ÁOr the Ulai Gate; also in 8.16.
27Dn 8:3 As I looked up, I saw a ram with two long horns standing beside the river®Á. One of the horns was longer than the other, even though it had grown later than the other one. / ®ÁOr the gate; also in 8.6.
27Dn 8:4 The ram butted everything out of his way to the west, to the north, and to the south, and no one could stand against him or help his victims. He did as he pleased and became very great.
27Dn 8:5 While I was watching, suddenly a male goat appeared from the west, crossing the land so swiftly that he didn°Øt even touch the ground. This goat, which had one very large horn between its eyes, 
27Dn 8:6 headed toward the two-horned ram that I had seen standing beside the river, rushing at him in a rage. 
27Dn 8:7 The goat charged furiously at the ram and struck him, breaking off both his horns. Now the ram was helpless, and the goat knocked him down and trampled him. No one could rescue the ram from the goat°Øs power.
27Dn 8:8 The goat became very powerful. But at the height of his power, his large horn was broken off. In the large horn°Øs place grew four prominent horns pointing in the four directions of the earth. 
27Dn 8:9 Then from one of the prominent horns came a small horn whose power grew very great. It extended toward the south and the east and toward the glorious land of Israel. 
27Dn 8:10 Its power reached to the heavens, where it attacked the heavenly army, throwing some of the heavenly beings and some of the stars to the ground and trampling them. 
27Dn 8:11 It even challenged the Commander of heaven°Øs army by canceling the daily sacrifices offered to him and by destroying his Temple. 
27Dn 8:12 The army of heaven was restrained from responding to this rebellion. So the daily sacrifice was halted, and truth was overthrown. The horn succeeded in everything it did®Á. / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew for these verses is uncertain.
27Dn 8:13 Then I heard two holy ones talking to each other. One of them asked, °∞How long will the events of this vision last? How long will the rebellion that causes desecration stop the daily sacrifices? How long will the Temple and heaven°Øs army be trampled on?°±
27Dn 8:14 The other replied, °∞It will take 2,300 evenings and mornings; then the Temple will be made right again.°±
27Dn 8:15 As I, Daniel, was trying to understand the meaning of this vision, someone who looked like a man stood in front of me. 
27Dn 8:16 And I heard a human voice calling out from the Ulai River, °∞Gabriel, tell this man the meaning of his vision.°±
27Dn 8:17 As Gabriel approached the place where I was standing, I became so terrified that I fell with my face to the ground. °∞Son of man,°± he said, °∞you must understand that the events you have seen in your vision relate to the time of the end.°±
27Dn 8:18 While he was speaking, I fainted and lay there with my face to the ground. But Gabriel roused me with a touch and helped me to my feet.
27Dn 8:19 Then he said, °∞I am here to tell you what will happen later in the time of wrath. What you have seen pertains to the very end of time. 
27Dn 8:20 The two-horned ram represents the kings of Media and Persia. 
27Dn 8:21 The shaggy male goat represents the king of Greece®Á, and the large horn between his eyes represents the first king of the Greek Empire. / ®ÁHebrew of Javan.
27Dn 8:22 The four prominent horns that replaced the one large horn show that the Greek Empire will break into four kingdoms, but none as great as the first.
27Dn 8:23 °∞At the end of their rule, when their sin is at its height, a fierce king, a master of intrigue, will rise to power. 
27Dn 8:24 He will become very strong, but not by his own power. He will cause a shocking amount of destruction and succeed in everything he does. He will destroy powerful leaders and devastate the holy people. 
27Dn 8:25 He will be a master of deception and will become arrogant; he will destroy many without warning. He will even take on the Prince of princes in battle, but he will be broken, though not by human power.
27Dn 8:26 °∞This vision about the 2,300 evenings and mornings®Á is true. But none of these things will happen for a long time, so keep this vision a secret.°± / ®ÁHebrew about the evenings and mornings; compare 8.14.
27Dn 8:27 Then I, Daniel, was overcome and lay sick for several days. Afterward I got up and performed my duties for the king, but I was greatly troubled by the vision and could not understand it.
27Dn 9:1 It was the first year of the reign of Darius the Mede, the son of Ahasuerus, who became king of the Babylonians®Á. / ®ÁOr the Chaldeans.
27Dn 9:2 During the first year of his reign, I, Daniel, learned from reading the word of the Lord, as revealed to Jeremiah the prophet, that Jerusalem must lie desolate for seventy years®Á. / ®ÁSee Jer 25.11-12; 29.10.
27Dn 9:3 So I turned to the Lord God and pleaded with him in prayer and fasting. I also wore rough burlap and sprinkled myself with ashes.
27Dn 9:4 I prayed to the Lord my God and confessed£∫ °∞O Lord, you are a great and awesome God! You always fulfill your covenant and keep your promises of unfailing love to those who love you and obey your commands. 
27Dn 9:5 But we have sinned and done wrong. We have rebelled against you and scorned your commands and regulations. 
27Dn 9:6 We have refused to listen to your servants the prophets, who spoke on your authority to our kings and princes and ancestors and to all the people of the land.
27Dn 9:7 °∞Lord, you are in the right; but as you see, our faces are covered with shame. This is true of all of us, including the people of Judah and Jerusalem and all Israel, scattered near and far, wherever you have driven us because of our disloyalty to you. 
27Dn 9:8 O Lord, we and our kings, princes, and ancestors are covered with shame because we have sinned against you. 
27Dn 9:9 But the Lord our God is merciful and forgiving, even though we have rebelled against him. 
27Dn 9:10 We have not obeyed the Lord our God, for we have not followed the instructions he gave us through his servants the prophets. 
27Dn 9:11 All Israel has disobeyed your instruction and turned away, refusing to listen to your voice. °∞So now the solemn curses and judgments written in the Law of Moses, the servant of God, have been poured down on us because of our sin. 
27Dn 9:12 You have kept your word and done to us and our rulers exactly as you warned. Never has there been such a disaster as happened in Jerusalem. 
27Dn 9:13 Every curse written against us in the Law of Moses has come true. Yet we have refused to seek mercy from the Lord our God by turning from our sins and recognizing his truth. 
27Dn 9:14 Therefore, the Lord has brought upon us the disaster he prepared. The Lord our God was right to do all of these things, for we did not obey him.
27Dn 9:15 °∞O Lord our God, you brought lasting honor to your name by rescuing your people from Egypt in a great display of power. But we have sinned and are full of wickedness. 
27Dn 9:16 In view of all your faithful mercies, Lord, please turn your furious anger away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. All the neighboring nations mock Jerusalem and your people because of our sins and the sins of our ancestors.
27Dn 9:17 °∞O our God, hear your servant°Øs prayer! Listen as I plead. For your own sake, Lord, smile again on your desolate sanctuary.
27Dn 9:18 °∞O my God, lean down and listen to me. Open your eyes and see our despair. See how your city - the city that bears your name - lies in ruins. We make this plea, not because we deserve help, but because of your mercy.
27Dn 9:19 °∞O Lord, hear. O Lord, forgive. O Lord, listen and act! For your own sake, do not delay, O my God, for your people and your city bear your name.°±
27Dn 9:20 I went on praying and confessing my sin and the sin of my people, pleading with the Lord my God for Jerusalem, his holy mountain. 
27Dn 9:21 As I was praying, Gabriel, whom I had seen in the earlier vision, came swiftly to me at the time of the evening sacrifice. 
27Dn 9:22 He explained to me, °∞Daniel, I have come here to give you insight and understanding. 
27Dn 9:23 The moment you began praying, a command was given. And now I am here to tell you what it was, for you are very precious to God. Listen carefully so that you can understand the meaning of your vision.
27Dn 9:24 °∞A period of seventy sets of seven®Á has been decreed for your people and your holy city to finish their rebellion, to put an end to their sin, to atone for their guilt, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to confirm the prophetic vision, and to anoint the Most Holy Place®Ë. / ®ÁHebrew seventy sevens. ®ËOr the Most Holy One.
27Dn 9:25 Now listen and understand! Seven sets of seven plus sixty-two sets of seven®Á will pass from the time the command is given to rebuild Jerusalem until a ruler - the Anointed One®Ë - comes. Jerusalem will be rebuilt with streets and strong defenses®È, despite the perilous times. / ®ÁHebrew Seven sevens plus sixty-two sevens. ®ËOr an anointed one; similarly in 9.26. Hebrew reads a messiah. ®ÈOr and a moat, or and trenches.
27Dn 9:26 °∞After this period of sixty-two sets of seven®Á, the Anointed One will be killed, appearing to have accomplished nothing, and a ruler will arise whose armies will destroy the city and the Temple. The end will come with a flood, and war and its miseries are decreed from that time to the very end. / ®ÁHebrew After sixty-two sevens.
27Dn 9:27 The ruler will make a treaty with the people for a period of one set of seven®Á, but after half this time, he will put an end to the sacrifices and offerings. And as a climax to all his terrible deeds®Ë, he will set up a sacrilegious object that causes desecration®È, until the fate decreed for this defiler is finally poured out on him.°± / ®ÁHebrew for one seven. ®ËHebrew And on the wing of abominations; the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. ®ÈHebrew an abomination of desolation.
27Dn 10:1 In the third year of the reign of King Cyrus of Persia®Á, Daniel (also known as Belteshazzar) had another vision. He understood that the vision concerned events certain to happen in the future - times of war and great hardship. / ®ÁThe third year of Cyrus°Øs reign was 536 b.c.
27Dn 10:2 When this vision came to me, I, Daniel, had been in mourning for three whole weeks. 
27Dn 10:3 All that time I had eaten no rich food. No meat or wine crossed my lips, and I used no fragrant lotions until those three weeks had passed.
27Dn 10:4 On April 23®Á, as I was standing on the bank of the great Tigris River, / ®ÁHebrew On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This date in the book of Daniel can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Persian records and can be related accurately to our modern calendar. This event occurred on April 23, 536 b.c.
27Dn 10:5 I looked up and saw a man dressed in linen clothing, with a belt of pure gold around his waist. 
27Dn 10:6 His body looked like a precious gem. His face flashed like lightning, and his eyes flamed like torches. His arms and feet shone like polished bronze, and his voice roared like a vast multitude of people.
27Dn 10:7 Only I, Daniel, saw this vision. The men with me saw nothing, but they were suddenly terrified and ran away to hide. 
27Dn 10:8 So I was left there all alone to see this amazing vision. My strength left me, my face grew deathly pale, and I felt very weak. 
27Dn 10:9 Then I heard the man speak, and when I heard the sound of his voice, I fainted and lay there with my face to the ground.
27Dn 10:10 Just then a hand touched me and lifted me, still trembling, to my hands and knees. 
27Dn 10:11 And the man said to me, °∞Daniel, you are very precious to God, so listen carefully to what I have to say to you. Stand up, for I have been sent to you.°± When he said this to me, I stood up, still trembling.
27Dn 10:12 Then he said, °∞Don°Øt be afraid, Daniel. Since the first day you began to pray for understanding and to humble yourself before your God, your request has been heard in heaven. I have come in answer to your prayer. 
27Dn 10:13 But for twenty-one days the spirit prince®Á of the kingdom of Persia blocked my way. Then Michael, one of the archangels®Ë, came to help me, and I left him there with the spirit prince of the kingdom of Persia®È. / ®ÁHebrew the prince; also in 10.13c, 20. ®ËHebrew the chief princes. ®ÈAs in one Greek version; Hebrew reads and I was left there with the kings of Persia. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
27Dn 10:14 Now I am here to explain what will happen to your people in the future, for this vision concerns a time yet to come.°±
27Dn 10:15 While he was speaking to me, I looked down at the ground, unable to say a word. 
27Dn 10:16 Then the one who looked like a man®Á touched my lips, and I opened my mouth and began to speak. I said to the one standing in front of me, °∞I am filled with anguish because of the vision I have seen, my lord, and I am very weak. / ®ÁAs in most manuscripts of the Masoretic Text; one manuscript of the Masoretic Text and one Greek version read Then something that looked like a human hand.
27Dn 10:17 How can someone like me, your servant, talk to you, my lord? My strength is gone, and I can hardly breathe.°±
27Dn 10:18 Then the one who looked like a man touched me again, and I felt my strength returning. 
27Dn 10:19 °∞Don°Øt be afraid,°± he said, °∞for you are very precious to God. Peace! Be encouraged! Be strong!°± As he spoke these words to me, I suddenly felt stronger and said to him, °∞Please speak to me, my lord, for you have strengthened me.°±
27Dn 10:20 He replied, °∞Do you know why I have come? Soon I must return to fight against the spirit prince of the kingdom of Persia, and after that the spirit prince of the kingdom of Greece®Á will come. / ®ÁHebrew of Javan.
27Dn 10:21 Meanwhile, I will tell you what is written in the Book of Truth. (No one helps me against these spirit princes except Michael, your spirit prince®Á. / ®ÁHebrew against these except Michael, your prince.
27Dn 11:1 I have been standing beside Michael®Á to support and strengthen him since the first year of the reign of Darius the Mede.) / ®ÁHebrew him.
27Dn 11:2 °∞Now then, I will reveal the truth to you. Three more Persian kings will reign, to be succeeded by a fourth, far richer than the others. He will use his wealth to stir up everyone to fight against the kingdom of Greece®Á. / ®ÁHebrew of Javan.
27Dn 11:3 °∞Then a mighty king will rise to power who will rule with great authority and accomplish everything he sets out to do. 
27Dn 11:4 But at the height of his power, his kingdom will be broken apart and divided into four parts. It will not be ruled by the king°Øs descendants, nor will the kingdom hold the authority it once had. For his empire will be uprooted and given to others.
27Dn 11:5 °∞The king of the south will increase in power, but one of his own officials will become more powerful than he and will rule his kingdom with great strength.
27Dn 11:6 °∞Some years later an alliance will be formed between the king of the north and the king of the south. The daughter of the king of the south will be given in marriage to the king of the north to secure the alliance, but she will lose her influence over him, and so will her father. She will be abandoned along with her supporters. 
27Dn 11:7 But when one of her relatives®Á becomes king of the south, he will raise an army and enter the fortress of the king of the north and defeat him. / ®ÁHebrew a branch from her roots.
27Dn 11:8 When he returns to Egypt, he will carry back their idols with him, along with priceless articles of gold and silver. For some years afterward he will leave the king of the north alone.
27Dn 11:9 °∞Later the king of the north will invade the realm of the king of the south but will soon return to his own land. 
27Dn 11:10 However, the sons of the king of the north will assemble a mighty army that will advance like a flood and carry the battle as far as the enemy°Øs fortress.
27Dn 11:11 °∞Then, in a rage, the king of the south will rally against the vast forces assembled by the king of the north and will defeat them. 
27Dn 11:12 After the enemy army is swept away, the king of the south will be filled with pride and will execute many thousands of his enemies. But his success will be short lived.
27Dn 11:13 °∞A few years later the king of the north will return with a fully equipped army far greater than before. 
27Dn 11:14 At that time there will be a general uprising against the king of the south. Violent men among your own people will join them in fulfillment of this vision, but they will not succeed. 
27Dn 11:15 Then the king of the north will come and lay siege to a fortified city and capture it. The best troops of the south will not be able to stand in the face of the onslaught.
27Dn 11:16 °∞The king of the north will march onward unopposed; none will be able to stop him. He will pause in the glorious land of Israel®Á, intent on destroying it. / ®ÁHebrew the glorious land.
27Dn 11:17 He will make plans to come with the might of his entire kingdom and will form an alliance with the king of the south. He will give him a daughter in marriage in order to overthrow the kingdom from within, but his plan will fail.
27Dn 11:18 °∞After this, he will turn his attention to the coastland and conquer many cities. But a commander from another land will put an end to his insolence and cause him to retreat in shame. 
27Dn 11:19 He will take refuge in his own fortresses but will stumble and fall and be seen no more.
27Dn 11:20 °∞His successor will send out a tax collector to maintain the royal splendor. But after a very brief reign, he will die, though not from anger or in battle.
27Dn 11:21 °∞The next to come to power will be a despicable man who is not in line for royal succession. He will slip in when least expected and take over the kingdom by flattery and intrigue. 
27Dn 11:22 Before him great armies will be swept away, including a covenant prince. 
27Dn 11:23 With deceitful promises, he will make various alliances. He will become strong despite having only a handful of followers. 
27Dn 11:24 Without warning he will enter the richest areas of the land. Then he will distribute among his followers the plunder and wealth of the rich - something his predecessors had never done. He will plot the overthrow of strongholds, but this will last for only a short while.
27Dn 11:25 °∞Then he will stir up his courage and raise a great army against the king of the south. The king of the south will go to battle with a mighty army, but to no avail, for there will be plots against him. 
27Dn 11:26 His own household will cause his downfall. His army will be swept away, and many will be killed. 
27Dn 11:27 Seeking nothing but each other°Øs harm, these kings will plot against each other at the conference table, attempting to deceive each other. But it will make no difference, for the end will come at the appointed time.
27Dn 11:28 °∞The king of the north will then return home with great riches. On the way he will set himself against the people of the holy covenant, doing much damage before continuing his journey.
27Dn 11:29 °∞Then at the appointed time he will once again invade the south, but this time the result will be different. 
27Dn 11:30 For warships from western coastlands®Á will scare him off, and he will withdraw and return home. But he will vent his anger against the people of the holy covenant and reward those who forsake the covenant. / ®ÁHebrew from Kittim.
27Dn 11:31 °∞His army will take over the Temple fortress, pollute the sanctuary, put a stop to the daily sacrifices, and set up the sacrilegious object that causes desecration®Á. / ®ÁHebrew the abomination of desolation.
27Dn 11:32 He will flatter and win over those who have violated the covenant. But the people who know their God will be strong and will resist him.
27Dn 11:33 °∞Wise leaders will give instruction to many, but these teachers will die by fire and sword, or they will be jailed and robbed. 
27Dn 11:34 During these persecutions, little help will arrive, and many who join them will not be sincere. 
27Dn 11:35 And some of the wise will fall victim to persecution. In this way, they will be refined and cleansed and made pure until the time of the end, for the appointed time is still to come.
27Dn 11:36 °∞The king will do as he pleases, exalting himself and claiming to be greater than every god, even blaspheming the God of gods. He will succeed, but only until the time of wrath is completed. For what has been determined will surely take place. 
27Dn 11:37 He will have no respect for the gods of his ancestors, or for the god loved by women, or for any other god, for he will boast that he is greater than them all. 
27Dn 11:38 Instead of these, he will worship the god of fortresses - a god his ancestors never knew - and lavish on him gold, silver, precious stones, and expensive gifts. 
27Dn 11:39 Claiming this foreign god°Øs help, he will attack the strongest fortresses. He will honor those who submit to him, appointing them to positions of authority and dividing the land among them as their reward®Á. / ®ÁOr at a price.
27Dn 11:40 °∞Then at the time of the end, the king of the south will attack the king of the north. The king of the north will storm out with chariots, charioteers, and a vast navy. He will invade various lands and sweep through them like a flood. 
27Dn 11:41 He will enter the glorious land of Israel®Á, and many nations will fall, but Moab, Edom, and the best part of Ammon will escape. / ®ÁHebrew the glorious land.
27Dn 11:42 He will conquer many countries, and even Egypt will not escape. 
27Dn 11:43 He will gain control over the gold, silver, and treasures of Egypt, and the Libyans and Ethiopians®Á will be his servants. / ®ÁHebrew Cushites.
27Dn 11:44 °∞But then news from the east and the north will alarm him, and he will set out in great anger to destroy and obliterate many. 
27Dn 11:45 He will stop between the glorious holy mountain and the sea and will pitch his royal tents. But while he is there, his time will suddenly run out, and no one will help him.
27Dn 12:1 °∞At that time Michael, the archangel®Á who stands guard over your nation, will arise. Then there will be a time of anguish greater than any since nations first came into existence. But at that time every one of your people whose name is written in the book will be rescued. / ®ÁHebrew the great prince.
27Dn 12:2 Many of those whose bodies lie dead and buried will rise up, some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting disgrace. 
27Dn 12:3 Those who are wise will shine as bright as the sky, and those who lead many to righteousness will shine like the stars forever. 
27Dn 12:4 But you, Daniel, keep this prophecy a secret; seal up the book until the time of the end, when many will rush here and there, and knowledge will increase.°±
27Dn 12:5 Then I, Daniel, looked and saw two others standing on opposite banks of the river. 
27Dn 12:6 One of them asked the man dressed in linen, who was now standing above the river, °∞How long will it be until these shocking events are over?°±
27Dn 12:7 The man dressed in linen, who was standing above the river, raised both his hands toward heaven and took a solemn oath by the One who lives forever, saying, °∞It will go on for a time, times, and half a time. When the shattering of the holy people has finally come to an end, all these things will have happened.°±
27Dn 12:8 I heard what he said, but I did not understand what he meant. So I asked, °∞How will all this finally end, my lord?°±
27Dn 12:9 But he said, °∞Go now, Daniel, for what I have said is kept secret and sealed until the time of the end. 
27Dn 12:10 Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined by these trials. But the wicked will continue in their wickedness, and none of them will understand. Only those who are wise will know what it means.
27Dn 12:11 °∞From the time the daily sacrifice is stopped and the sacrilegious object that causes desecration®Á is set up to be worshiped, there will be 1,290 days. / ®ÁHebrew the abomination of desolation.
27Dn 12:12 And blessed are those who wait and remain until the end of the 1,335 days!
27Dn 12:13 °∞As for you, go your way until the end. You will rest, and then at the end of the days, you will rise again to receive the inheritance set aside for you.°±

28Hs 1:1 The Lord gave this message to Hosea son of Beeri during the years when Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah, and Jeroboam son of Jehoash®Á was king of Israel. / ®ÁHebrew Joash, a variant spelling of Jehoash. 
28Hs 1:2 When the Lord first began speaking to Israel through Hosea, he said to him, °∞Go and marry a prostitute®Á, so that some of her children will be conceived in prostitution. This will illustrate how Israel has acted like a prostitute by turning against the Lord and worshiping other gods.°± / ®ÁOr a promiscuous woman.
28Hs 1:3 So Hosea married Gomer, the daughter of Diblaim, and she became pregnant and gave Hosea a son. 
28Hs 1:4 And the Lord said, °∞Name the child Jezreel, for I am about to punish King Jehu°Øs dynasty to avenge the murders he committed at Jezreel. In fact, I will bring an end to Israel°Øs independence. 
28Hs 1:5 I will break its military power in the Jezreel Valley.°±
28Hs 1:6 Soon Gomer became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter. And the Lord said to Hosea, °∞Name your daughter Lo-ruhamah - °ÆNot loved°Ø - for I will no longer show love to the people of Israel or forgive them. 
28Hs 1:7 But I will show love to the people of Judah. I will free them from their enemies - not with weapons and armies or horses and charioteers, but by my power as the Lord their God.°±
28Hs 1:8 After Gomer had weaned Lo-ruhamah, she again became pregnant and gave birth to a second son. 
28Hs 1:9 And the Lord said, °∞Name him Lo-ammi - °ÆNot my people°Ø - for Israel is not my people, and I am not their God.
28Hs 1:10 ®Á°∞Yet the time will come when Israel°Øs people will be like the sands of the seashore - too many to count! Then, at the place where they were told, °ÆYou are not my people,°Ø it will be said, °ÆYou are children of the living God.°Ø / ®ÁVerses 1:10-11 are numbered 2:1-2 in Hebrew text.
28Hs 1:11 Then the people of Judah and Israel will unite together. They will choose one leader for themselves, and they will return from exile together. What a day that will be - the day of Jezreel®Á - when God will again plant his people in his land. / ®ÁJezreel means °∞God plants.°±
28Hs 2:1 ®Á°∞In that day you will call your brothers Ammi - °ÆMy people.°Ø And you will call your sisters Ruhamah - °ÆThe ones I love.°Ø / ®ÁVerses 2:1-23 are numbered 2:3-25 in Hebrew text.
28Hs 2:2 °∞But now bring charges against Israel - your mother - for she is no longer my wife, and I am no longer her husband. Tell her to remove the prostitute°Øs makeup from her face and the clothing that exposes her breasts.
28Hs 2:3 Otherwise, I will strip her as naked as she was on the day she was born. I will leave her to die of thirst, as in a dry and barren wilderness.
28Hs 2:4 And I will not love her children, for they were conceived in prostitution.
28Hs 2:5 Their mother is a shameless prostitute and became pregnant in a shameful way. She said, °ÆI°Øll run after other lovers and sell myself to them for food and water, for clothing of wool and linen, and for olive oil and drinks.°Ø
28Hs 2:6 °∞For this reason I will fence her in with thornbushes. I will block her path with a wall to make her lose her way.
28Hs 2:7 When she runs after her lovers, she won°Øt be able to catch them. She will search for them but not find them. Then she will think, °ÆI might as well return to my husband, for I was better off with him than I am now.°Ø
28Hs 2:8 She doesn°Øt realize it was I who gave her everything she has - the grain, the new wine, the olive oil; I even gave her silver and gold. But she gave all my gifts to Baal.
28Hs 2:9 °∞But now I will take back the ripened grain and new wine I generously provided each harvest season. I will take away the wool and linen clothing I gave her to cover her nakedness.
28Hs 2:10 I will strip her naked in public, while all her lovers look on. No one will be able to rescue her from my hands.
28Hs 2:11 I will put an end to her annual festivals, her new moon celebrations, and her Sabbath days - all her appointed festivals.
28Hs 2:12 I will destroy her grapevines and fig trees, things she claims her lovers gave her. I will let them grow into tangled thickets, where only wild animals will eat the fruit.
28Hs 2:13 I will punish her for all those times when she burned incense to her images of Baal, when she put on her earrings and jewels and went out to look for her lovers but forgot all about me,°± says the Lord.
28Hs 2:14 °∞But then I will win her back once again. I will lead her into the desert and speak tenderly to her there.
28Hs 2:15 I will return her vineyards to her and transform the Valley of Trouble®Á into a gateway of hope. She will give herself to me there, as she did long ago when she was young, when I freed her from her captivity in Egypt. / ®ÁHebrew valley of Achor.
28Hs 2:16 When that day comes,°± says the Lord, °∞you will call me °Æmy husband°Ø instead of °Æmy master.°Ø®Á / ®ÁHebrew °Æmy baal.°Ø
28Hs 2:17 O Israel, I will wipe the many names of Baal from your lips, and you will never mention them again.
28Hs 2:18 On that day I will make a covenant with all the wild animals and the birds of the sky and the animals that scurry along the ground so they will not harm you. I will remove all weapons of war from the land, all swords and bows, so you can live unafraid in peace and safety.
28Hs 2:19 I will make you my wife forever, showing you righteousness and justice, unfailing love and compassion.
28Hs 2:20 I will be faithful to you and make you mine, and you will finally know me as the Lord.
28Hs 2:21 °∞In that day, I will answer,°± says the Lord. °∞I will answer the sky as it pleads for clouds. And the sky will answer the earth with rain.
28Hs 2:22 Then the earth will answer the thirsty cries of the grain, the grapevines, and the olive trees. And they in turn will answer, °ÆJezreel°Ø - °ÆGod plants!°Ø
28Hs 2:23 At that time I will plant a crop of Israelites and raise them for myself. I will show love to those I called °ÆNot loved.°Ø®Á And to those I called °ÆNot my people,°Ø®Ë I will say, °ÆNow you are my people.°Ø And they will reply, °ÆYou are our God!°Ø°± / ®ÁHebrew Lo-ruhamah; see 1:6. ®ËHebrew Lo-ammi; see 1:9.
28Hs 3:1 Then the Lord said to me, °∞Go and love your wife again, even though she®Á commits adultery with another lover. This will illustrate that the Lord still loves Israel, even though the people have turned to other gods and love to worship them®Ë.°± / ®ÁOr Go and love a woman who. ®ËHebrew love their raisin cakes.
28Hs 3:2 So I bought her back for fifteen pieces of silver®Á and five bushels of barley and a measure of wine®Ë. / ®ÁHebrew 15 shekels of silver, about 6 ounces or 171 grams in weight. ®ËAs in Greek version, which reads a homer of barley and a measure of wine; Hebrew reads a homer [5 bushels or 182 liters] of barley and a lethech [2.5 bushels or 91 liters] of barley.
28Hs 3:3 Then I said to her, °∞You must live in my house for many days and stop your prostitution. During this time, you will not have sexual relations with anyone, not even with me®Á.°± / ®ÁOr and I will live with you.
28Hs 3:4 This shows that Israel will go a long time without a king or prince, and without sacrifices, sacred pillars, priests®Á, or even idols! / ®ÁHebrew ephod, the vest worn by the priest.
28Hs 3:5 But afterward the people will return and devote themselves to the Lord their God and to David°Øs descendant, their king®Á. In the last days, they will tremble in awe of the Lord and of his goodness. / ®ÁHebrew to David their king.
28Hs 4:1 Hear the word of the Lord, O people of Israel! The Lord has brought charges against you, saying£∫ °∞There is no faithfulness, no kindness, no knowledge of God in your land.
28Hs 4:2 You make vows and break them; you kill and steal and commit adultery. There is violence everywhere - one murder after another.
28Hs 4:3 That is why your land is in mourning, and everyone is wasting away. Even the wild animals, the birds of the sky, and the fish of the sea are disappearing.
28Hs 4:4 °∞Don°Øt point your finger at someone else and try to pass the blame! My complaint, you priests, is with you®Á. / ®ÁHebrew Your people are like those with a complaint against the priests.
28Hs 4:5 So you will stumble in broad daylight, and your false prophets will fall with you in the night. And I will destroy Israel, your mother.
28Hs 4:6 My people are being destroyed because they don°Øt know me. Since you priests refuse to know me, I refuse to recognize you as my priests. Since you have forgotten the laws of your God, I will forget to bless your children.
28Hs 4:7 The more priests there are, the more they sin against me. They have exchanged the glory of God for the shame of idols®Á. / ®ÁAs in Syriac version and an ancient Hebrew tradition; Masoretic Text reads I will turn their glory into shame.
28Hs 4:8 °∞When the people bring their sin offerings, the priests get fed. So the priests are glad when the people sin!
28Hs 4:9 °ÆAnd what the priests do, the people also do.°Ø So now I will punish both priests and people for their wicked deeds.
28Hs 4:10 They will eat and still be hungry. They will play the prostitute and gain nothing from it, for they have deserted the Lord
28Hs 4:11 to worship other gods. °∞Wine has robbed my people of their understanding.
28Hs 4:12 They ask a piece of wood for advice! They think a stick can tell them the future! Longing after idols has made them foolish. They have played the prostitute, serving other gods and deserting their God.
28Hs 4:13 They offer sacrifices to idols on the mountaintops. They go up into the hills to burn incense in the pleasant shade of oaks, poplars, and terebinth trees. °∞That is why your daughters turn to prostitution, and your daughters-in-law commit adultery.
28Hs 4:14 But why should I punish them for their prostitution and adultery? For your men are doing the same thing, sinning with whores and shrine prostitutes. O foolish people! You refuse to understand, so you will be destroyed.
28Hs 4:15 °∞Though you, Israel, are a prostitute, may Judah avoid such guilt. Do not join the false worship at Gilgal or Beth-aven®Á, even though they take oaths there in the Lord°Øs name. / ®ÁBeth-aven means °∞house of wickedness°±; it is being used as another name for Bethel, which means °∞house of God.°±
28Hs 4:16 Israel is stubborn, like a stubborn heifer. So should the Lord feed her like a lamb in a lush pasture?
28Hs 4:17 Leave Israel®Á alone, because she is married to idolatry. / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel.
28Hs 4:18 When the rulers of Israel finish their drinking, off they go to find some prostitutes. They love shame more than honor®Á. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; the meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
28Hs 4:19 So a mighty wind will sweep them away. Their sacrifices to idols will bring them shame.
28Hs 5:1 °∞Hear this, you priests. Pay attention, you leaders of Israel. Listen, you members of the royal family. Judgment has been handed down against you. For you have led the people into a snare by worshiping the idols at Mizpah and Tabor.
28Hs 5:2 You have dug a deep pit to trap them at Acacia Grove®Á. But I will settle with you for what you have done. / ®ÁHebrew at Shittim. The meaning of the Hebrew for this sentence is uncertain.
28Hs 5:3 I know what you are like, O Ephraim. You cannot hide yourself from me, O Israel. You have left me as a prostitute leaves her husband; you are utterly defiled.
28Hs 5:4 Your deeds won°Øt let you return to your God. You are a prostitute through and through, and you do not know the Lord.
28Hs 5:5 °∞The arrogance of Israel testifies against her; Israel and Ephraim will stumble under their load of guilt. Judah, too, will fall with them.
28Hs 5:6 When they come with their flocks and herds to offer sacrifices to the Lord, they will not find him, because he has withdrawn from them.
28Hs 5:7 They have betrayed the honor of the Lord, bearing children that are not his. Now their false religion will devour them along with their wealth®Á. / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
28Hs 5:8 °∞Sound the alarm in Gibeah! Blow the trumpet in Ramah! Raise the battle cry in Beth-aven®Á! Lead on into battle, O warriors of Benjamin! / ®ÁBeth-aven means °∞house of wickedness°±; it is being used as another name for Bethel, which means °∞house of God.°±
28Hs 5:9 One thing is certain, Israel®Á£∫ On your day of punishment, you will become a heap of rubble. / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel; also in 5:11, 12, 13, 14.
28Hs 5:10 °∞The leaders of Judah have become like thieves®Á. So I will pour my anger on them like a waterfall. / ®ÁHebrew like those who move a boundary marker.
28Hs 5:11 The people of Israel will be crushed and broken by my judgment because they are determined to worship idols®Á. / ®ÁOr determined to follow human commands. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
28Hs 5:12 I will destroy Israel as a moth consumes wool. I will make Judah as weak as rotten wood.
28Hs 5:13 °∞When Israel and Judah saw how sick they were, Israel turned to Assyria - to the great king there - but he could neither help nor cure them.
28Hs 5:14 I will be like a lion to Israel, like a strong young lion to Judah. I will tear them to pieces! I will carry them off, and no one will be left to rescue them.
28Hs 5:15 Then I will return to my place until they admit their guilt and turn to me. For as soon as trouble comes, they will earnestly search for me.°±
28Hs 6:1 °∞Come, let us return to the Lord. He has torn us to pieces; now he will heal us. He has injured us; now he will bandage our wounds.
28Hs 6:2 In just a short time he will restore us, so that we may live in his presence.
28Hs 6:3 Oh, that we might know the Lord! Let us press on to know him. He will respond to us as surely as the arrival of dawn or the coming of rains in early spring.°±
28Hs 6:4 °∞O Israel®Á and Judah, what should I do with you?°± asks the Lord. °∞For your love vanishes like the morning mist and disappears like dew in the sunlight. / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel.
28Hs 6:5 I sent my prophets to cut you to pieces - to slaughter you with my words, with judgments as inescapable as light.
28Hs 6:6 I want you to show love®Á, not offer sacrifices. I want you to know me®Ë more than I want burnt offerings./ ®ÁGreek version reads to show mercy. Compare Matt 9:13; 12:7. ®ËHebrew to know God.
28Hs 6:7 But like Adam®Á, you broke my covenant and betrayed my trust. / ®ÁOr But at Adam.
28Hs 6:8 °∞Gilead is a city of sinners, tracked with footprints of blood.
28Hs 6:9 Priests form bands of robbers, waiting in ambush for their victims. They murder travelers along the road to Shechem and practice every kind of sin.
28Hs 6:10 Yes, I have seen something horrible in Ephraim and Israel£∫ My people are defiled by prostituting themselves with other gods!
28Hs 6:11 °∞O Judah, a harvest of punishment is also waiting for you, though I wanted to restore the fortunes of my people.
28Hs 7:1 °∞I want to heal Israel®Á, but its sins are too great. Samaria is filled with liars. Thieves are on the inside and bandits on the outside! / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel; also in 7:8, 11.
28Hs 7:2 Its people don°Øt realize that I am watching them. Their sinful deeds are all around them, and I see them all.
28Hs 7:3 °∞The people entertain the king with their wickedness, and the princes laugh at their lies.
28Hs 7:4 They are all adulterers, always aflame with lust. They are like an oven that is kept hot while the baker is kneading the dough.
28Hs 7:5 On royal holidays, the princes get drunk with wine, carousing with those who mock them.
28Hs 7:6 Their hearts are like an oven blazing with intrigue. Their plot smolders®Á through the night, and in the morning it breaks out like a raging fire. / ®ÁHebrew Their baker sleeps.
28Hs 7:7 Burning like an oven, they consume their leaders. They kill their kings one after another, and no one cries to me for help.
28Hs 7:8 °∞The people of Israel mingle with godless foreigners, making themselves as worthless as a half-baked cake!
28Hs 7:9 Worshiping foreign gods has sapped their strength, but they don°Øt even know it. Their hair is gray, but they don°Øt realize they°Øre old and weak.
28Hs 7:10 Their arrogance testifies against them, yet they don°Øt return to the Lord their God or even try to find him.
28Hs 7:11 °∞The people of Israel have become like silly, witless doves, first calling to Egypt, then flying to Assyria for help.
28Hs 7:12 But as they fly about, I will throw my net over them and bring them down like a bird from the sky. I will punish them for all the evil they do®Á. / ®ÁHebrew I will punish them because of what was reported against them in the assembly.
28Hs 7:13 °∞What sorrow awaits those who have deserted me! Let them die, for they have rebelled against me. I wanted to redeem them, but they have told lies about me.
28Hs 7:14 They do not cry out to me with sincere hearts. Instead, they sit on their couches and wail. They cut themselves®Á, begging foreign gods for grain and new wine, and they turn away from me. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads They gather together.
28Hs 7:15 I trained them and made them strong, yet now they plot evil against me.
28Hs 7:16 They look everywhere except to the Most High. They are as useless as a crooked bow. Their leaders will be killed by their enemies because of their insolence toward me. Then the people of Egypt will laugh at them.
28Hs 8:1 °∞Sound the alarm! The enemy descends like an eagle on the people of the Lord, for they have broken my covenant and revolted against my law.
28Hs 8:2 Now Israel pleads with me, °ÆHelp us, for you are our God!°Ø
28Hs 8:3 But it is too late. The people of Israel have rejected what is good, and now their enemies will chase after them.
28Hs 8:4 The people have appointed kings without my consent, and princes without my knowledge. By making idols for themselves from their silver and gold, they have brought about their own destruction.
28Hs 8:5 °∞O Samaria, I reject this calf - this idol you have made. My fury burns against you. How long will you be incapable of innocence?
28Hs 8:6 This calf you worship, O Israel, was crafted by your own hands! It is not God! Therefore, it must be smashed to bits.
28Hs 8:7 °∞They have planted the wind and will harvest the whirlwind. The stalks of grain wither and produce nothing to eat. And even if there is any grain, foreigners will eat it.
28Hs 8:8 The people of Israel have been swallowed up; they lie among the nations like an old discarded pot.
28Hs 8:9 Like a wild donkey looking for a mate, they have gone up to Assyria. The people of Israel®Á have sold themselves - sold themselves to many lovers. / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel; also in 8:11.
28Hs 8:10 But though they have sold themselves to many allies, I will now gather them together for judgment. Then they will writhe under the burden of the great king.
28Hs 8:11 °∞Israel has built many altars to take away sin, but these very altars became places for sinning!
28Hs 8:12 Even though I gave them all my laws, they act as if those laws don°Øt apply to them.
28Hs 8:13 The people of Israel love their rituals of sacrifice, but to me their sacrifices are all meaningless. I will hold my people accountable for their sins, and I will punish them. They will return to Egypt.
28Hs 8:14 Israel has forgotten its Maker and built great palaces, and Judah has fortified its cities. Therefore, I will send down fire on their cities and will burn up their fortresses.°±
28Hs 9:1 O people of Israel, do not rejoice as other nations do. For you have been unfaithful to your God, hiring yourselves out like prostitutes, worshiping other gods on every threshing floor.
28Hs 9:2 So now your harvests will be too small to feed you. There will be no grapes for making new wine.
28Hs 9:3 You may no longer stay here in the Lord°Øs land. Instead, you will return to Egypt, and in Assyria you will eat food that is ceremonially unclean.
28Hs 9:4 There you will make no offerings of wine to the Lord. None of your sacrifices there will please him. They will be unclean, like food touched by a person in mourning. All who present such sacrifices will be defiled. They may eat this food themselves, but they may not offer it to the Lord.
28Hs 9:5 What then will you do on festival days? How will you observe the Lord°Øs festivals?
28Hs 9:6 Even if you escape destruction from Assyria, Egypt will conquer you, and Memphis®Á will bury you. Nettles will take over your treasures of silver; thistles will invade your ruined homes. / ®ÁMemphis was the capital of northern Egypt.
28Hs 9:7 The time of Israel°Øs punishment has come; the day of payment is here. Soon Israel will know this all too well. Because of your great sin and hostility, you say, °∞The prophets are crazy and the inspired men are fools!°±
28Hs 9:8 The prophet is a watchman over Israel®Á for my God, yet traps are laid for him wherever he goes. He faces hostility even in the house of God. / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel; also in 9:11, 13, 16.
28Hs 9:9 The things my people do are as depraved as what they did in Gibeah long ago. God will not forget. He will surely punish them for their sins.
28Hs 9:10 The Lord says, °∞O Israel, when I first found you, it was like finding fresh grapes in the desert. When I saw your ancestors, it was like seeing the first ripe figs of the season. But then they deserted me for Baal-peor, giving themselves to that shameful idol. Soon they became vile, as vile as the god they worshiped.
28Hs 9:11 The glory of Israel will fly away like a bird, for your children will not be born or grow in the womb or even be conceived.
28Hs 9:12 Even if you do have children who grow up, I will take them from you. It will be a terrible day when I turn away and leave you alone.
28Hs 9:13 I have watched Israel become as beautiful as Tyre. But now Israel will bring out her children for slaughter.°±
28Hs 9:14 O Lord, what should I request for your people? I will ask for wombs that don°Øt give birth and breasts that give no milk.
28Hs 9:15 The Lord says, °∞All their wickedness began at Gilgal; there I began to hate them. I will drive them from my land because of their evil actions. I will love them no more because all their leaders are rebels.
28Hs 9:16 The people of Israel are struck down. Their roots are dried up, and they will bear no more fruit. And if they give birth, I will slaughter their beloved children.°±
28Hs 9:17 My God will reject the people of Israel because they will not listen or obey. They will be wanderers, homeless among the nations.
28Hs 10:1 How prosperous Israel is - a luxuriant vine loaded with fruit. But the richer the people get, the more pagan altars they build. The more bountiful their harvests, the more beautiful their sacred pillars.
28Hs 10:2 The hearts of the people are fickle; they are guilty and must be punished. The Lord will break down their altars and smash their sacred pillars.
28Hs 10:3 Then they will say, °∞We have no king because we didn°Øt fear the Lord. But even if we had a king, what could he do for us anyway?°±
28Hs 10:4 They spout empty words and make covenants they don°Øt intend to keep. So injustice springs up among them like poisonous weeds in a farmer°Øs field.
28Hs 10:5 The people of Samaria tremble in fear for what might happen to their calf idol at Beth-aven®Á. The people mourn and the priests wail, because its glory will be stripped away®Ë. / ®ÁBeth-aven means °∞house of wickedness°±; it is being used as another name for Bethel, which means °∞house of God.°± ®ËOr because it will be taken away into exile.
28Hs 10:6 This idol will be carted away to Assyria, a gift to the great king there. Ephraim will be ridiculed and Israel will be shamed, because its people have trusted in this idol.
28Hs 10:7 Samaria and its king will be cut off; they will float away like driftwood on an ocean wave.
28Hs 10:8 And the pagan shrines of Aven®Á, the place of Israel°Øs sin, will crumble. Thorns and thistles will grow up around their altars. They will beg the mountains, °∞Bury us!°± and plead with the hills, °∞Fall on us!°± / ®ÁAven is a reference to Beth-aven; see 10:5a and the note there.
28Hs 10:9 The Lord says, °∞O Israel, ever since Gibeah, there has been only sin and more sin! You have made no progress whatsoever. Was it not right that the wicked men of Gibeah were attacked?
28Hs 10:10 Now whenever it fits my plan, I will attack you, too. I will call out the armies of the nations to punish you for your multiplied sins.
28Hs 10:11 °∞Israel®Á is like a trained heifer treading out the grain - an easy job she loves. But I will put a heavy yoke on her tender neck. I will force Judah to pull the plow and Israel®Ë to break up the hard ground. / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel. ®ËHebrew Jacob. The names °∞Jacob°± and °∞Israel°± are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation.
28Hs 10:12 I said, °ÆPlant the good seeds of righteousness, and you will harvest a crop of love. Plow up the hard ground of your hearts, for now is the time to seek the Lord, that he may come and shower righteousness upon you.°Ø
28Hs 10:13 °∞But you have cultivated wickedness and harvested a thriving crop of sins. You have eaten the fruit of lies - trusting in your military might, believing that great armies could make your nation safe.
28Hs 10:14 Now the terrors of war will rise among your people. All your fortifications will fall, just as when Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel. Even mothers and children were dashed to death there.
28Hs 10:15 You will share that fate, Bethel, because of your great wickedness. When the day of judgment dawns, the king of Israel will be completely destroyed.
28Hs 11:1 °∞When Israel was a child, I loved him, and I called my son out of Egypt.
28Hs 11:2 But the more I®Á called to him, the farther he moved from me, offering sacrifices to the images of Baal and burning incense to idols. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads they.
28Hs 11:3 I myself taught Israel®Á how to walk, leading him along by the hand. But he doesn°Øt know or even care that it was I who took care of him. / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel; also in 11:8, 9, 12.
28Hs 11:4 I led Israel along with my ropes of kindness and love. I lifted the yoke from his neck, and I myself stooped to feed him.
28Hs 11:5 °∞But since my people refuse to return to me, they will return to Egypt and will be forced to serve Assyria.
28Hs 11:6 War will swirl through their cities; their enemies will crash through their gates. They will destroy them, trapping them in their own evil plans.
28Hs 11:7 For my people are determined to desert me. They call me the Most High, but they don°Øt truly honor me.
28Hs 11:8 °∞Oh, how can I give you up, Israel? How can I let you go? How can I destroy you like Admah or demolish you like Zeboiim? My heart is torn within me, and my compassion overflows.
28Hs 11:9 No, I will not unleash my fierce anger. I will not completely destroy Israel, for I am God and not a mere mortal. I am the Holy One living among you, and I will not come to destroy.
28Hs 11:10 For someday the people will follow me. I, the Lord, will roar like a lion. And when I roar, my people will return trembling from the west.
28Hs 11:11 Like a flock of birds, they will come from Egypt. Trembling like doves, they will return from Assyria. And I will bring them home again,°± says the Lord.
28Hs 11:12 ®ÁIsrael surrounds me with lies and deceit, but Judah still obeys God and is faithful to the Holy One®Ë. / ®ÁVerse 11:12 is numbered 12:1 in Hebrew text. ®ËOr and Judah is unruly against God, the faithful Holy One. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
28Hs 12:1 ®Á The people of Israel®Ë feed on the wind; they chase after the east wind all day long. They pile up lies and violence; they are making an alliance with Assyria while sending olive oil to buy support from Egypt. / ®ÁVerses 12:1-14 are numbered 12:2-15 in Hebrew text. ®ËHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel; also in 12:8, 14.
28Hs 12:2 Now the Lord is bringing charges against Judah. He is about to punish Jacob®Á for all his deceitful ways, and pay him back for all he has done. / ®ÁJacob sounds like the Hebrew word for °∞deceiver.°±
28Hs 12:3 Even in the womb, Jacob struggled with his brother; when he became a man, he even fought with God.
28Hs 12:4 Yes, he wrestled with the angel and won. He wept and pleaded for a blessing from him. There at Bethel he met God face to face, and God spoke to him®Á - / ®ÁAs in Greek and Syriac versions; Hebrew reads to us.
28Hs 12:5 the Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies, the Lord is his name!
28Hs 12:6 So now, come back to your God. Act with love and justice, and always depend on him.
28Hs 12:7 But no, the people are like crafty merchants selling from dishonest scales - they love to cheat.
28Hs 12:8 Israel boasts, °∞I am rich! I°Øve made a fortune all by myself! No one has caught me cheating! My record is spotless!°±
28Hs 12:9 °∞But I am the Lord your God, who rescued you from slavery in Egypt. And I will make you live in tents again, as you do each year at the Festival of Shelters®Á. / ®ÁHebrew as in the days of your appointed feast.
28Hs 12:10 I sent my prophets to warn you with many visions and parables.°±
28Hs 12:11 But the people of Gilead are worthless because of their idol worship. And in Gilgal, too, they sacrifice bulls; their altars are lined up like the heaps of stone along the edges of a plowed field.
28Hs 12:12 Jacob fled to the land of Aram, and there he®Á earned a wife by tending sheep. / ®ÁHebrew Israel. See note on 10:11b.
28Hs 12:13 Then by a prophet the Lord brought Jacob°Øs descendants®Á out of Egypt; and by that prophet they were protected. / ®ÁHebrew brought Israel. See note on 10:11b.
28Hs 12:14 But the people of Israel have bitterly provoked the Lord, so their Lord will now sentence them to death in payment for their sins.
28Hs 13:1 When the tribe of Ephraim spoke, the people shook with fear, for that tribe was important in Israel. But the people of Ephraim sinned by worshiping Baal and thus sealed their destruction.
28Hs 13:2 Now they continue to sin by making silver idols, images shaped skillfully with human hands. °∞Sacrifice to these,°± they cry, °∞and kiss the calf idols!°±
28Hs 13:3 Therefore, they will disappear like the morning mist, like dew in the morning sun, like chaff blown by the wind, like smoke from a chimney.
28Hs 13:4 °∞I have been the Lord your God ever since I brought you out of Egypt. You must acknowledge no God but me, for there is no other savior.
28Hs 13:5 I took care of you in the wilderness, in that dry and thirsty land.
28Hs 13:6 But when you had eaten and were satisfied, you became proud and forgot me.
28Hs 13:7 So now I will attack you like a lion, like a leopard that lurks along the road.
28Hs 13:8 Like a bear whose cubs have been taken away, I will tear out your heart. I will devour you like a hungry lioness and mangle you like a wild animal.
28Hs 13:9 °∞You are about to be destroyed, O Israel - yes, by me, your only helper.
28Hs 13:10 Now where is®Á your king? Let him save you! Where are all the leaders of the land, the king and the officials you demanded of me? / ®ÁAs in Greek and Syriac versions and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew reads I will be.
28Hs 13:11 In my anger I gave you kings, and in my fury I took them away.
28Hs 13:12 °∞Ephraim°Øs guilt has been collected, and his sin has been stored up for punishment.
28Hs 13:13 Pain has come to the people like the pain of childbirth, but they are like a child who resists being born. The moment of birth has arrived, but they stay in the womb!
28Hs 13:14 °∞Should I ransom them from the grave®Á? Should I redeem them from death? O death, bring on your terrors! O grave, bring on your plagues!®Ë For I will not take pity on them. / ®ÁHebrew Sheol; also in 13:14b. ®ËGreek version reads O death, where is your punishment? / O grave [Hades], where is your sting? Compare 1 Cor 15:55.
28Hs 13:15 Ephraim was the most fruitful of all his brothers, but the east wind - a blast from the Lord - will arise in the desert. All their flowing springs will run dry, and all their wells will disappear. Every precious thing they own will be plundered and carried away.
28Hs 13:16 The people of Samaria must bear the consequences of their guilt because they rebelled against their God. They will be killed by an invading army, their little ones dashed to death against the ground, their pregnant women ripped open by swords.°±
28Hs 14:1 Return, O Israel, to the Lord your God, for your sins have brought you down.
28Hs 14:2 Bring your confessions, and return to the Lord. Say to him, °∞Forgive all our sins and graciously receive us, so that we may offer you our praises.
28Hs 14:3 Assyria cannot save us, nor can our warhorses. Never again will we say to the idols we have made, °ÆYou are our gods.°Ø No, in you alone do the orphans find mercy.°±
28Hs 14:4 The Lord says, °∞Then I will heal you of your faithlessness; my love will know no bounds, for my anger will be gone forever.
28Hs 14:5 I will be to Israel like a refreshing dew from heaven. Israel will blossom like the lily; it will send roots deep into the soil like the cedars in Lebanon.
28Hs 14:6 Its branches will spread out like beautiful olive trees, as fragrant as the cedars of Lebanon.
28Hs 14:7 My people will again live under my shade. They will flourish like grain and blossom like grapevines. They will be as fragrant as the wines of Lebanon.
28Hs 14:8 °∞O Israel®Á, stay away from idols! I am the one who answers your prayers and cares for you. I am like a tree that is always green; all your fruit comes from me.°± / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel.
28Hs 14:9 Let those who are wise understand these things. Let those with discernment listen carefully. The paths of the Lord are true and right, and righteous people live by walking in them. But in those paths sinners stumble and fall.
29
29Jl 1:1 The Lord gave this message to Joel son of Pethuel.
29Jl 1:2 Hear this, you leaders of the people. Listen, all who live in the land. In all your history, has anything like this happened before?
29Jl 1:3 Tell your children about it in the years to come, and let your children tell their children. Pass the story down from generation to generation.
29Jl 1:4 After the cutting locusts finished eating the crops, the swarming locusts took what was left! After them came the hopping locusts, and then the stripping locusts®Á, too! / ®ÁThe precise identification of the four kinds of locusts mentioned here is uncertain.
29Jl 1:5 Wake up, you drunkards, and weep! Wail, all you wine-drinkers! All the grapes are ruined, and all your sweet wine is gone.
29Jl 1:6 A vast army of locusts®Á has invaded my land, a terrible army too numerous to count. Its teeth are like lions°Ø teeth, its fangs like those of a lioness. / ®ÁHebrew A nation.
29Jl 1:7 It has destroyed my grapevines and ruined my fig trees, stripping their bark and destroying it, leaving the branches white and bare.
29Jl 1:8 Weep like a bride dressed in black, mourning the death of her husband.
29Jl 1:9 For there is no grain or wine to offer at the Temple of the Lord. So the priests are in mourning. The ministers of the Lord are weeping.
29Jl 1:10 The fields are ruined, the land is stripped bare. The grain is destroyed, the grapes have shriveled, and the olive oil is gone.
29Jl 1:11 Despair, all you farmers! Wail, all you vine growers! Weep, because the wheat and barley - all the crops of the field - are ruined.
29Jl 1:12 The grapevines have dried up, and the fig trees have withered. The pomegranate trees, palm trees, and apple trees - all the fruit trees - have dried up. And the people°Øs joy has dried up with them.
29Jl 1:13 Dress yourselves in burlap and weep, you priests! Wail, you who serve before the altar! Come, spend the night in burlap, you ministers of my God. For there is no grain or wine to offer at the Temple of your God.
29Jl 1:14 Announce a time of fasting; call the people together for a solemn meeting. Bring the leaders and all the people of the land into the Temple of the Lord your God, and cry out to him there.
29Jl 1:15 The day of the Lord is near, the day when destruction comes from the Almighty. How terrible that day will be!
29Jl 1:16 Our food disappears before our very eyes. No joyful celebrations are held in the house of our God.
29Jl 1:17 The seeds die in the parched ground, and the grain crops fail. The barns stand empty, and granaries are abandoned.
29Jl 1:18 How the animals moan with hunger! The herds of cattle wander about confused, because they have no pasture. The flocks of sheep and goats bleat in misery.
29Jl 1:19 Lord, help us! The fire has consumed the wilderness pastures, and flames have burned up all the trees.
29Jl 1:20 Even the wild animals cry out to you because the streams have dried up, and fire has consumed the wilderness pastures.
29Jl 2:1 Sound the alarm in Jerusalem®Á! Raise the battle cry on my holy mountain! Let everyone tremble in fear because the day of the Lord is upon us. / ®ÁHebrew Zion; also in 2.15, 23.
29Jl 2:2 It is a day of darkness and gloom, a day of thick clouds and deep blackness. Suddenly, like dawn spreading across the mountains, a great and mighty army appears. Nothing like it has been seen before or will ever be seen again.
29Jl 2:3 Fire burns in front of them, and flames follow after them. Ahead of them the land lies as beautiful as the Garden of Eden. Behind them is nothing but desolation; not one thing escapes.
29Jl 2:4 They look like horses; they charge forward like warhorses®Á. / ®ÁOr like charioteers.
29Jl 2:5 Look at them as they leap along the mountaintops. Listen to the noise they make - like the rumbling of chariots, like the roar of fire sweeping across a field of stubble, or like a mighty army moving into battle.
29Jl 2:6 Fear grips all the people; every face grows pale with terror.
29Jl 2:7 The attackers march like warriors and scale city walls like soldiers. Straight forward they march, never breaking rank.
29Jl 2:8 They never jostle each other; each moves in exactly the right position. They break through defenses without missing a step.
29Jl 2:9 They swarm over the city and run along its walls. They enter all the houses, climbing like thieves through the windows.
29Jl 2:10 The earth quakes as they advance, and the heavens tremble. The sun and moon grow dark, and the stars no longer shine.
29Jl 2:11 The Lord is at the head of the column. He leads them with a shout. This is his mighty army, and they follow his orders. The day of the Lord is an awesome, terrible thing. Who can possibly survive?
29Jl 2:12 That is why the Lord says, °∞Turn to me now, while there is time. Give me your hearts. Come with fasting, weeping, and mourning.
29Jl 2:13 Don°Øt tear your clothing in your grief, but tear your hearts instead.°± Return to the Lord your God, for he is merciful and compassionate, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love. He is eager to relent and not punish.
29Jl 2:14 Who knows? Perhaps he will give you a reprieve, sending you a blessing instead of this curse. Perhaps you will be able to offer grain and wine to the Lord your God as before.
29Jl 2:15 Blow the ram°Øs horn in Jerusalem! Announce a time of fasting; call the people together for a solemn meeting.
29Jl 2:16 Gather all the people - the elders, the children, and even the babies. Call the bridegroom from his quarters and the bride from her private room.
29Jl 2:17 Let the priests, who minister in the Lord°Øs presence, stand and weep between the entry room to the Temple and the altar. Let them pray, °∞Spare your people, Lord! Don°Øt let your special possession become an object of mockery. Don°Øt let them become a joke for unbelieving foreigners who say, °ÆHas the God of Israel left them?°Ø°±
29Jl 2:18 Then the Lord will pity his people and jealously guard the honor of his land.
29Jl 2:19 The Lord will reply, °∞Look! I am sending you grain and new wine and olive oil, enough to satisfy your needs. You will no longer be an object of mockery among the surrounding nations.
29Jl 2:20 I will drive away these armies from the north. I will send them into the parched wastelands. Those in the front will be driven into the Dead Sea, and those at the rear into the Mediterranean®Á. The stench of their rotting bodies will rise over the land.°± Surely the Lord has done great things! / ®ÁHebrew into the eastern sea, . . . into the western sea.
29Jl 2:21 Don°Øt be afraid, my people. Be glad now and rejoice, for the Lord has done great things.
29Jl 2:22 Don°Øt be afraid, you animals of the field, for the wilderness pastures will soon be green. The trees will again be filled with fruit; fig trees and grapevines will be loaded down once more.
29Jl 2:23 Rejoice, you people of Jerusalem! Rejoice in the Lord your God! For the rain he sends demonstrates his faithfulness. Once more the autumn rains will come, as well as the rains of spring.
29Jl 2:24 The threshing floors will again be piled high with grain, and the presses will overflow with new wine and olive oil.
29Jl 2:25 The Lord says, °∞I will give you back what you lost to the swarming locusts, the hopping locusts, the stripping locusts, and the cutting locusts®Á. It was I who sent this great destroying army against you. / ®ÁThe precise identification of the four kinds of locusts mentioned here is uncertain.
29Jl 2:26 Once again you will have all the food you want, and you will praise the Lord your God, who does these miracles for you. Never again will my people be disgraced.
29Jl 2:27 Then you will know that I am among my people Israel, that I am the Lord your God, and there is no other. Never again will my people be disgraced.
29Jl 2:28 ®Á°∞Then, after doing all those things, I will pour out my Spirit upon all people. Your sons and daughters will prophesy. Your old men will dream dreams, and your young men will see visions. / ®ÁVerses 2.28-32 are numbered 3.1-5 in Hebrew text.
29Jl 2:29 In those days I will pour out my Spirit even on servants - men and women alike.
29Jl 2:30 And I will cause wonders in the heavens and on the earth - blood and fire and columns of smoke.
29Jl 2:31 The sun will become dark, and the moon will turn blood red before that great and terrible®Á day of the Lord arrives. / ®ÁGreek version reads glorious.
29Jl 2:32 But everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved, for some on Mount Zion in Jerusalem will escape, just as the Lord has said. These will be among the survivors whom the Lord has called.
29Jl 3:1 ®Á°∞At the time of those events,°± says the Lord, °∞when I restore the prosperity of Judah and Jerusalem, / ®ÁVerses 3.1-21 are numbered 4.1-21 in Hebrew text.
29Jl 3:2 I will gather the armies of the world into the valley of Jehoshaphat®Á. There I will judge them for harming my people, my special possession, for scattering my people among the nations, and for dividing up my land. / ®ÁJehoshaphat means °∞the Lord judges.°±

29Jl 3:8 I will sell your sons and daughters to the people of Judah, and they will sell them to the people of Arabia®Á, a nation far away. I, the Lord, have spoken!°± / ®ÁHebrew to the Sabeans.
29Jl 3:9 Say to the nations far and wide£∫ °∞Get ready for war! Call out your best warriors. Let all your fighting men advance for the attack.
29Jl 3:10 Hammer your plowshares into swords and your pruning hooks into spears. Train even your weaklings to be warriors.
29Jl 3:11 Come quickly, all you nations everywhere. Gather together in the valley.°± And now, O Lord, call out your warriors!
29Jl 3:12 °∞Let the nations be called to arms. Let them march to the valley of Jehoshaphat. There I, the Lord, will sit to pronounce judgment on them all.
29Jl 3:13 Swing the sickle, for the harvest is ripe®Á. Come, tread the grapes, for the winepress is full. The storage vats are overflowing with the wickedness of these people.°± / ®ÁGreek version reads for the harvest time has come. Compare Mark 4.29.

30Am 1:1 This message was given to Amos, a shepherd from the town of Tekoa in Judah. He received this message in visions two years before the earthquake, when Uzziah was king of Judah and Jeroboam II, the son of Jehoash®Á, was king of Israel. / ®ÁHebrew Joash, a variant spelling of Jehoash.
30Am 1:2 This is what he saw and heard. °∞The Lord°Øs voice will roar from Zion and thunder from Jerusalem! The lush pastures of the shepherds will dry up; the grass on Mount Carmel will wither and die.°±
30Am 1:3 This is what the Lord says. °∞The people of Damascus have sinned again and again®Á, and I will not let them go unpunished! They beat down my people in Gilead as grain is threshed with iron sledges. / ®ÁHebrew have committed three sins, even four; also in 1.6, 9, 11, 13.

30Am 1:7 So I will send down fire on the walls of Gaza, and all its fortresses will be destroyed.
30Am 1:8 I will slaughter the people of Ashdod and destroy the king of Ashkelon. Then I will turn to attack Ekron, and the few Philistines still left will be killed,°± says the Sovereign Lord.
30Am 1:9 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞The people of Tyre have sinned again and again, and I will not let them go unpunished! They broke their treaty of brotherhood with Israel, selling whole villages as slaves to Edom.
30Am 1:10 So I will send down fire on the walls of Tyre, and all its fortresses will be destroyed.°±
30Am 1:11 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞The people of Edom have sinned again and again, and I will not let them go unpunished! They chased down their relatives, the Israelites, with swords, showing them no mercy. In their rage, they slashed them continually and were unrelenting in their anger.
30Am 1:12 So I will send down fire on Teman, and the fortresses of Bozrah will be destroyed.°±
30Am 1:13 This is what the Lord says. °∞The people of Ammon have sinned again and again, and I will not let them go unpunished! When they attacked Gilead to extend their borders, they ripped open pregnant women with their swords.
30Am 1:14 So I will send down fire on the walls of Rabbah, and all its fortresses will be destroyed. The battle will come upon them with shouts, like a whirlwind in a mighty storm.
30Am 1:15 And their king®Á and his princes will go into exile together,°± says the Lord. / ®ÁHebrew malcam, possibly referring to their god Molech.
30Am 2:1 This is what the Lord says. °∞The people of Moab have sinned again and again®Á, and I will not let them go unpunished! They desecrated the bones of Edom°Øs king, burning them to ashes. / ®ÁHebrew have committed three sins, even four; also in 2.4, 6.

30Am 2:3 And I will destroy their king and slaughter all their princes,°± says the Lord.
30Am 2:4 This is what the Lord says. °∞The people of Judah have sinned again and again, and I will not let them go unpunished! They have rejected the instruction of the Lord, refusing to obey his decrees. They have been led astray by the same lies that deceived their ancestors.
30Am 2:5 So I will send down fire on Judah, and all the fortresses of Jerusalem will be destroyed.°±
30Am 2:6 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞The people of Israel have sinned again and again, and I will not let them go unpunished! They sell honorable people for silver and poor people for a pair of sandals.
30Am 2:7 They trample helpless people in the dust and shove the oppressed out of the way. Both father and son sleep with the same woman, corrupting my holy name.
30Am 2:8 At their religious festivals, they lounge in clothing their debtors put up as security. In the house of their god, they drink wine bought with unjust fines.
30Am 2:9 °∞But as my people watched, I destroyed the Amorites, though they were as tall as cedars and as strong as oaks. I destroyed the fruit on their branches and dug out their roots.
30Am 2:10 It was I who rescued you from Egypt and led you through the desert for forty years, so you could possess the land of the Amorites.
30Am 2:11 I chose some of your sons to be prophets and others to be Nazirites. Can you deny this, my people of Israel?°± asks the Lord.
30Am 2:12 °∞But you caused the Nazirites to sin by making them drink wine, and you commanded the prophets, °ÆShut up!°Ø
30Am 2:13 °∞So I will make you groan like a wagon loaded down with sheaves of grain.
30Am 2:14 Your fastest runners will not get away. The strongest among you will become weak. Even mighty warriors will be unable to save themselves.
30Am 2:15 The archers will not stand their ground. The swiftest runners won°Øt be fast enough to escape. Even those riding horses won°Øt be able to save themselves.
30Am 2:16 On that day the most courageous of your fighting men will drop their weapons and run for their lives,°± says the Lord.
30Am 3:1 Listen to this message that the Lord has spoken against you, O people of Israel and Judah - against the entire family I rescued from Egypt.
30Am 3:2 °∞From among all the families on the earth, I have been intimate with you alone. That is why I must punish you for all your sins.°±
30Am 3:3 Can two people walk together without agreeing on the direction?
30Am 3:4 Does a lion ever roar in a thicket without first finding a victim? Does a young lion growl in its den without first catching its prey?
30Am 3:5 Does a bird ever get caught in a trap that has no bait? Does a trap spring shut when there°Øs nothing to catch?
30Am 3:6 When the ram°Øs horn blows a warning, shouldn°Øt the people be alarmed? Does disaster come to a city unless the Lord has planned it?
30Am 3:7 Indeed, the Sovereign Lord never does anything until he reveals his plans to his servants the prophets.
30Am 3:8 The lion has roared - so who isn°Øt frightened? The Sovereign Lord has spoken - so who can refuse to proclaim his message?
30Am 3:9 Announce this to the leaders of Philistia®Á and to the great ones of Egypt. °∞Take your seats now on the hills around Samaria, and witness the chaos and oppression in Israel.°± / ®ÁHebrew Ashdod.
30Am 3:10 °∞My people have forgotten how to do right,°± says the Lord. °∞Their fortresses are filled with wealth taken by theft and violence.
30Am 3:11 Therefore,°± says the Sovereign Lord, °∞an enemy is coming! He will surround them and shatter their defenses. Then he will plunder all their fortresses.°±
30Am 3:12 This is what the Lord says. °∞A shepherd who tries to rescue a sheep from a lion°Øs mouth will recover only two legs or a piece of an ear. So it will be for the Israelites in Samaria lying on luxurious beds, and for the people of Damascus reclining on couches.®Á / ®ÁOr So it will be when the Israelites in Samaria are rescued with only a broken bed and a tattered pillow.
30Am 3:13 °∞Now listen to this, and announce it throughout all Israel®Á,°± says the Lord, the Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies. / ®ÁHebrew the house of Jacob. The names °∞Jacob°± and °∞Israel°± are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation.
30Am 3:14 °∞On the very day I punish Israel for its sins, I will destroy the pagan altars at Bethel. The horns of the altar will be cut off and fall to the ground.
30Am 3:15 And I will destroy the beautiful homes of the wealthy - their winter mansions and their summer houses, too - all their palaces filled with ivory,°± says the Lord.
30Am 4:1 Listen to me, you fat cows®Á living in Samaria, you women who oppress the poor and crush the needy, and who are always calling to your husbands, °∞Bring us another drink!°± / ®ÁHebrew you cows of Bashan.
30Am 4:2 The Sovereign Lord has sworn this by his holiness. °∞The time will come when you will be led away with hooks in your noses. Every last one of you will be dragged away like a fish on a hook!
30Am 4:3 You will be led out through the ruins of the wall; you will be thrown from your fortresses®Á,°± says the Lord. / ®ÁOr thrown out toward Harmon, possibly a reference to Mount Hermon.
30Am 4:4 °∞Go ahead and offer sacrifices to the idols at Bethel. Keep on disobeying at Gilgal. Offer sacrifices each morning, and bring your tithes every three days.
30Am 4:5 Present your bread made with yeast as an offering of thanksgiving. Then give your extra voluntary offerings so you can brag about it everywhere! This is the kind of thing you Israelites love to do,°± says the Sovereign Lord.
30Am 4:6 °∞I brought hunger to every city and famine to every town. But still you would not return to me,°± says the Lord.
30Am 4:7 °∞I kept the rain from falling when your crops needed it the most. I sent rain on one town but withheld it from another. Rain fell on one field, while another field withered away.
30Am 4:8 People staggered from town to town looking for water, but there was never enough. But still you would not return to me,°± says the Lord.
30Am 4:9 °∞I struck your farms and vineyards with blight and mildew. Locusts devoured all your fig and olive trees. But still you would not return to me,°± says the Lord.
30Am 4:10 °∞I sent plagues on you like the plagues I sent on Egypt long ago. I killed your young men in war and led all your horses away®Á. The stench of death filled the air! But still you would not return to me,°± says the Lord. / ®ÁOr and slaughtered your captured horses.
30Am 4:11 °∞I destroyed some of your cities, as I destroyed®Á Sodom and Gomorrah. Those of you who survived were like charred sticks pulled from a fire. But still you would not return to me,°± says the Lord. / ®ÁHebrew as when God destroyed.
30Am 4:12 °∞Therefore, I will bring upon you all the disasters I have announced. Prepare to meet your God in judgment, you people of Israel!°±
30Am 4:13 For the Lord is the one who shaped the mountains, stirs up the winds, and reveals his thoughts to mankind. He turns the light of dawn into darkness and treads on the heights of the earth. The Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies is his name!
30Am 5:1 Listen, you people of Israel! Listen to this funeral song I am singing.
30Am 5:2 °∞The virgin Israel has fallen, never to rise again! She lies abandoned on the ground, with no one to help her up.°±
30Am 5:3 The Sovereign Lord says. °∞When a city sends a thousand men to battle, only a hundred will return. When a town sends a hundred, only ten will come back alive.°±
30Am 5:4 Now this is what the Lord says to the family of Israel. °∞Come back to me and live!
30Am 5:5 Don°Øt worship at the pagan altars at Bethel; don°Øt go to the shrines at Gilgal or Beersheba. For the people of Gilgal will be dragged off into exile, and the people of Bethel will be reduced to nothing.°±
30Am 5:6 Come back to the Lord and live! Otherwise, he will roar through Israel®Á like a fire, devouring you completely. Your gods in Bethel won°Øt be able to quench the flames. / ®ÁHebrew the house of Joseph.
30Am 5:7 You twist justice, making it a bitter pill for the oppressed. You treat the righteous like dirt.
30Am 5:8 It is the Lord who created the stars, the Pleiades and Orion. He turns darkness into morning and day into night. He draws up water from the oceans and pours it down as rain on the land. The Lord is his name!
30Am 5:9 With blinding speed and power he destroys the strong, crushing all their defenses.
30Am 5:10 How you hate honest judges! How you despise people who tell the truth!
30Am 5:11 You trample the poor, stealing their grain through taxes and unfair rent. Therefore, though you build beautiful stone houses, you will never live in them. Though you plant lush vineyards, you will never drink wine from them.
30Am 5:12 For I know the vast number of your sins and the depth of your rebellions. You oppress good people by taking bribes and deprive the poor of justice in the courts.
30Am 5:13 So those who are smart keep their mouths shut, for it is an evil time.
30Am 5:14 Do what is good and run from evil so that you may live! Then the Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies will be your helper, just as you have claimed.
30Am 5:15 Hate evil and love what is good; turn your courts into true halls of justice. Perhaps even yet the Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies will have mercy on the remnant of his people®Á. / ®ÁHebrew the remnant of Joseph.
30Am 5:16 Therefore, this is what the Lord, the Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies, says. °∞There will be crying in all the public squares and mourning in every street. Call for the farmers to weep with you, and summon professional mourners to wail.
30Am 5:17 There will be wailing in every vineyard, for I will destroy them all,°± says the Lord.
30Am 5:18 What sorrow awaits you who say, °∞If only the day of the Lord were here!°± You have no idea what you are wishing for. That day will bring darkness, not light.
30Am 5:19 In that day you will be like a man who runs from a lion - only to meet a bear. Escaping from the bear, he leans his hand against a wall in his house - and he°Øs bitten by a snake.
30Am 5:20 Yes, the day of the Lord will be dark and hopeless, without a ray of joy or hope.
30Am 5:21 °∞I hate all your show and pretense - the hypocrisy of your religious festivals and solemn assemblies.
30Am 5:22 I will not accept your burnt offerings and grain offerings. I won°Øt even notice all your choice peace offerings.
30Am 5:23 Away with your noisy hymns of praise! I will not listen to the music of your harps.
30Am 5:24 Instead, I want to see a mighty flood of justice, an endless river of righteous living.
30Am 5:25 °∞Was it to me you were bringing sacrifices and offerings during the forty years in the wilderness, Israel? 
30Am 5:26 No, you served your pagan gods - Sakkuth your king god and Kaiwan your star god - the images you made for yourselves. 
30Am 5:27 So I will send you into exile, to a land east of Damascus®Á,°± says the Lord, whose name is the God of Heaven°Øs Armies. / ®ÁGreek version reads No, you carried your pagan gods - the shrine of Molech, the star of your god Rephan, and the images you made for yourselves. So I will send you into exile, to a land east of Damascus. Compare Acts 7.43.
30Am 6:1 What sorrow awaits you who lounge in luxury in Jerusalem®Á, and you who feel secure in Samaria! You are famous and popular in Israel, and people go to you for help. / ®ÁHebrew in Zion.
30Am 6:2 But go over to Calneh and see what happened there. Then go to the great city of Hamath and down to the Philistine city of Gath. You are no better than they were, and look at how they were destroyed.
30Am 6:3 You push away every thought of coming disaster, but your actions only bring the day of judgment closer.
30Am 6:4 How terrible for you who sprawl on ivory beds and lounge on your couches, eating the meat of tender lambs from the flock and of choice calves fattened in the stall.
30Am 6:5 You sing trivial songs to the sound of the harp and fancy yourselves to be great musicians like David.
30Am 6:6 You drink wine by the bowlful and perfume yourselves with fragrant lotions. You care nothing about the ruin of your nation®Á. / ®ÁHebrew of Joseph.
30Am 6:7 Therefore, you will be the first to be led away as captives. Suddenly, all your parties will end.
30Am 6:8 The Sovereign Lord has sworn by his own name, and this is what he, the Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies, says£∫ °∞I despise the arrogance of Israel®Á, and I hate their fortresses. I will give this city and everything in it to their enemies.°± / ®ÁHebrew Jacob. See note on 3.13.
30Am 6:9 (If there are ten men left in one house, they will all die. 
30Am 6:10 And when a relative who is responsible to dispose of the dead®Á goes into the house to carry out the bodies, he will ask the last survivor, °∞Is anyone else with you?°± When the person begins to swear, °∞No, by . . .,°± he will interrupt and say, °∞Stop! Don°Øt even mention the name of the Lord.°±) / ®ÁOr to burn the dead. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
30Am 6:11 When the Lord gives the command, homes both great and small will be smashed to pieces.
30Am 6:12 Can horses gallop over boulders? Can oxen be used to plow them? But that°Øs how foolish you are when you turn justice into poison and the sweet fruit of righteousness into bitterness.
30Am 6:13 And you brag about your conquest of Lo-debar®Á. You boast, °∞Didn°Øt we take Karnaim®Ë by our own strength?°± / ®ÁLo-debar means °∞nothing.°± ®ËKarnaim means °∞horns,°± a term that symbolizes strength.
30Am 6:14 °∞O people of Israel, I am about to bring an enemy nation against you,°± says the Lord God of Heaven°Øs Armies. °∞They will oppress you throughout your land - from Lebo-hamath in the north to the Arabah Valley in the south.°±
30Am 7:1 The Sovereign Lord showed me a vision. I saw him preparing to send a vast swarm of locusts over the land. This was after the king°Øs share had been harvested from the fields and as the main crop was coming up. 
30Am 7:2 In my vision the locusts ate every green plant in sight. Then I said, °∞O Sovereign Lord, please forgive us or we will not survive, for Israel®Á is so small.°± / ®ÁHebrew Jacob; also in 7.5. See note on 3.13.
30Am 7:3 So the Lord relented from this plan. °∞I will not do it,°± he said.
30Am 7:4 Then the Sovereign Lord showed me another vision. I saw him preparing to punish his people with a great fire. The fire had burned up the depths of the sea and was devouring the entire land. 
30Am 7:5 Then I said, °∞O Sovereign Lord, please stop or we will not survive, for Israel is so small.°±
30Am 7:6 Then the Lord relented from this plan, too. °∞I will not do that either,°± said the Sovereign Lord.
30Am 7:7 Then he showed me another vision. I saw the Lord standing beside a wall that had been built using a plumb line. He was using a plumb line to see if it was still straight. 
30Am 7:8 And the Lord said to me, °∞Amos, what do you see?°± I answered, °∞A plumb line.°± And the Lord replied, °∞I will test my people with this plumb line. I will no longer ignore all their sins. 
30Am 7:9 The pagan shrines of your ancestors®Á will be ruined, and the temples of Israel will be destroyed; I will bring the dynasty of King Jeroboam to a sudden end.°± / ®ÁHebrew of Isaac.
30Am 7:10 Then Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, sent a message to Jeroboam, king of Israel£∫ °∞Amos is hatching a plot against you right here on your very doorstep! What he is saying is intolerable. 
30Am 7:11 He is saying, °ÆJeroboam will soon be killed, and the people of Israel will be sent away into exile.°Ø°±
30Am 7:12 Then Amaziah sent orders to Amos£∫ °∞Get out of here, you prophet! Go on back to the land of Judah, and earn your living by prophesying there! 
30Am 7:13 Don°Øt bother us with your prophecies here in Bethel. This is the king°Øs sanctuary and the national place of worship!°±
30Am 7:14 But Amos replied, °∞I°Øm not a professional prophet, and I was never trained to be one®Á. I°Øm just a shepherd, and I take care of sycamore-fig trees. / ®ÁOr I°Øm not a prophet nor the son of a prophet.
30Am 7:15 But the Lord called me away from my flock and told me, °ÆGo and prophesy to my people in Israel.°Ø 
30Am 7:16 Now then, listen to this message from the Lord. °∞You say, °ÆDon°Øt prophesy against Israel. Stop preaching against my people®Á.°Ø / ®ÁHebrew against the house of Isaac.
30Am 7:17 But this is what the Lord says. °ÆYour wife will become a prostitute in this city, and your sons and daughters will be killed. Your land will be divided up, and you yourself will die in a foreign land. And the people of Israel will certainly become captives in exile, far from their homeland.°Ø°±
30Am 8:1 Then the Sovereign Lord showed me another vision. In it I saw a basket filled with ripe fruit. 
30Am 8:2 °∞What do you see, Amos?°± he asked. I replied, °∞A basket full of ripe fruit.°± Then the Lord said, °∞Like this fruit, Israel is ripe for punishment! I will not delay their punishment again. 
30Am 8:3 In that day the singing in the Temple will turn to wailing. Dead bodies will be scattered everywhere. They will be carried out of the city in silence. I, the Sovereign Lord, have spoken!°±
30Am 8:4 Listen to this, you who rob the poor and trample down the needy!
30Am 8:5 You can°Øt wait for the Sabbath day to be over and the religious festivals to end so you can get back to cheating the helpless. You measure out grain with dishonest measures and cheat the buyer with dishonest scales®Á. / ®ÁHebrew You make the ephah [a unit for measuring grain] small and the shekel [a unit of weight] great, and you deal falsely by using deceitful balances.
30Am 8:6 And you mix the grain you sell with chaff swept from the floor. Then you enslave poor people for one piece of silver or a pair of sandals.
30Am 8:7 Now the Lord has sworn this oath by his own name, the Pride of Israel®Á. °∞I will never forget the wicked things you have done! / ®ÁHebrew the pride of Jacob. See note on 3.13.
30Am 8:8 The earth will tremble for your deeds, and everyone will mourn. The ground will rise like the Nile River at floodtime; it will heave up, then sink again.
30Am 8:9 °∞In that day,°± says the Sovereign Lord, °∞I will make the sun go down at noon and darken the earth while it is still day.
30Am 8:10 I will turn your celebrations into times of mourning and your singing into weeping. You will wear funeral clothes and shave your heads to show your sorrow - as if your only son had died. How very bitter that day will be!
30Am 8:11 °∞The time is surely coming,°± says the Sovereign Lord, °∞when I will send a famine on the land - not a famine of bread or water but of hearing the words of the Lord.
30Am 8:12 People will stagger from sea to sea and wander from border to border®Á searching for the word of the Lord, but they will not find it. / ®ÁHebrew from north to east.
30Am 8:13 Beautiful girls and strong young men will grow faint in that day, thirsting for the Lord°Øs word.
30Am 8:14 And those who swear by the shameful idols of Samaria - who take oaths in the name of the god of Dan and make vows in the name of the god of Beersheba®Á - they will all fall down, never to rise again.°± / ®ÁHebrew the way of Beersheba.
30Am 9:1 Then I saw a vision of the Lord standing beside the altar. He said, °∞Strike the tops of the Temple columns, so that the foundation will shake. Bring down the roof on the heads of the people below. I will kill with the sword those who survive. No one will escape!
30Am 9:2 °∞Even if they dig down to the place of the dead®Á, I will reach down and pull them up. Even if they climb up into the heavens, I will bring them down. / ®ÁHebrew to Sheol.
30Am 9:3 Even if they hide at the very top of Mount Carmel, I will search them out and capture them. Even if they hide at the bottom of the ocean, I will send the sea serpent after them to bite them.
30Am 9:4 Even if their enemies drive them into exile, I will command the sword to kill them there. I am determined to bring disaster upon them and not to help them.°±
30Am 9:5 The Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, touches the land and it melts, and all its people mourn. The ground rises like the Nile River at floodtime, and then it sinks again.
30Am 9:6 The Lord°Øs home reaches up to the heavens, while its foundation is on the earth. He draws up water from the oceans and pours it down as rain on the land. The Lord is his name!
30Am 9:7 °∞Are you Israelites more important to me than the Ethiopians?®Á°± asks the Lord. °∞I brought Israel out of Egypt, but I also brought the Philistines from Crete®Ë and led the Arameans out of Kir. / ®ÁHebrew the Cushites? ®ËHebrew Caphtor.
30Am 9:8 °∞I, the Sovereign Lord, am watching this sinful nation of Israel. I will destroy it from the face of the earth. But I will never completely destroy the family of Israel®Á,°± says the Lord. / ®ÁHebrew the house of Jacob. See note on 3.13.
30Am 9:9 °∞For I will give the command and will shake Israel along with the other nations as grain is shaken in a sieve, yet not one true kernel will be lost.
30Am 9:10 But all the sinners will die by the sword - all those who say, °ÆNothing bad will happen to us.°Ø
30Am 9:11 °∞In that day I will restore the fallen house®Á of David. I will repair its damaged walls. From the ruins I will rebuild it and restore its former glory. / ®ÁOr kingdom; Hebrew reads tent.
30Am 9:12 And Israel will possess what is left of Edom and all the nations I have called to be mine®Á.°± The Lord has spoken, and he will do these things. / ®ÁGreek version reads and restore its former glory, so that the rest of humanity, including the Gentiles - all those I have called to be mine - might seek me. Compare Acts 15.16-17.
30Am 9:13 °∞The time will come,°± says the Lord, °∞when the grain and grapes will grow faster than they can be harvested. Then the terraced vineyards on the hills of Israel will drip with sweet wine!
30Am 9:14 I will bring my exiled people of Israel back from distant lands, and they will rebuild their ruined cities and live in them again. They will plant vineyards and gardens; they will eat their crops and drink their wine.
30Am 9:15 I will firmly plant them there in their own land. They will never again be uprooted from the land I have given them,°± says the Lord your God.

31Ob 1:1 This is the vision that the Sovereign Lord revealed to Obadiah concerning the land of Edom. We have heard a message from the Lord that an ambassador was sent to the nations to say, °∞Get ready, everyone! Let°Øs assemble our armies and attack Edom!°±
31Ob 1:2 The Lord says to Edom, °∞I will cut you down to size among the nations; you will be greatly despised.
31Ob 1:3 You have been deceived by your own pride because you live in a rock fortress and make your home high in the mountains. °ÆWho can ever reach us way up here?°Ø you ask boastfully.
31Ob 1:4 But even if you soar as high as eagles and build your nest among the stars, I will bring you crashing down,°± says the Lord.
31Ob 1:5 °∞If thieves came at night and robbed you (what a disaster awaits you!), they would not take everything. Those who harvest grapes always leave a few for the poor. But your enemies will wipe you out completely!
31Ob 1:6 Every nook and cranny of Edom®Á will be searched and looted. Every treasure will be found and taken. / ®ÁHebrew Esau; also in 8b, 9, 18, 19, 21.
31Ob 1:7 °∞All your allies will turn against you. They will help to chase you from your land. They will promise you peace while plotting to deceive and destroy you. Your trusted friends will set traps for you, and you won°Øt even know about it.
31Ob 1:8 At that time not a single wise person will be left in the whole land of Edom,°± says the Lord. °∞For on the mountains of Edom I will destroy everyone who has understanding.
31Ob 1:9 The mightiest warriors of Teman will be terrified, and everyone on the mountains of Edom will be cut down in the slaughter.
31Ob 1:10 °∞Because of the violence you did to your close relatives in Israel®Á, you will be filled with shame and destroyed forever. / ®ÁHebrew your brother Jacob. The names °∞Jacob°± and °∞Israel°± are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation.
31Ob 1:11 When they were invaded, you stood aloof, refusing to help them. Foreign invaders carried off their wealth and cast lots to divide up Jerusalem, but you acted like one of Israel°Øs enemies.
31Ob 1:12 °∞You should not have gloated when they exiled your relatives to distant lands. You should not have rejoiced when the people of Judah suffered such misfortune. You should not have spoken arrogantly in that terrible time of trouble.
31Ob 1:13 You should not have plundered the land of Israel when they were suffering such calamity. You should not have gloated over their destruction when they were suffering such calamity. You should not have seized their wealth when they were suffering such calamity.
31Ob 1:14 You should not have stood at the crossroads, killing those who tried to escape. You should not have captured the survivors and handed them over in their terrible time of trouble.
31Ob 1:15 °∞The day is near when I, the Lord, will judge all godless nations! As you have done to Israel, so it will be done to you. All your evil deeds will fall back on your own heads.
31Ob 1:16 Just as you swallowed up my people on my holy mountain, so you and the surrounding nations will swallow the punishment I pour out on you. Yes, all you nations will drink and stagger and disappear from history.

31Ob 1:19 °∞Then my people living in the Negev will occupy the mountains of Edom. Those living in the foothills of Judah®Á will possess the Philistine plains and take over the fields of Ephraim and Samaria. And the people of Benjamin will occupy the land of Gilead. / ®ÁHebrew the Shephelah.
31Ob 1:20 The exiles of Israel will return to their land and occupy the Phoenician coast as far north as Zarephath. The captives from Jerusalem exiled in the north®Á will return home and resettle the towns of the Negev. / ®ÁHebrew in Sepharad.
31Ob 1:21 Those who have been rescued®Á will go up to®Ë Mount Zion in Jerusalem to rule over the mountains of Edom. And the Lord himself will be king!°± / ®ÁAs in Greek and Syriac versions; Hebrew reads Rescuers. ®ËOr from.

32Jnh 1:1 The Lord gave this message to Jonah son of Amittai£∫ 
32Jnh 1:2 °∞Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh. Announce my judgment against it because I have seen how wicked its people are.°±
32Jnh 1:3 But Jonah got up and went in the opposite direction to get away from the Lord. He went down to the port of Joppa, where he found a ship leaving for Tarshish. He bought a ticket and went on board, hoping to escape from the Lord by sailing to Tarshish.
32Jnh 1:4 But the Lord hurled a powerful wind over the sea, causing a violent storm that threatened to break the ship apart. 
32Jnh 1:5 Fearing for their lives, the desperate sailors shouted to their gods for help and threw the cargo overboard to lighten the ship. But all this time Jonah was sound asleep down in the hold. 
32Jnh 1:6 So the captain went down after him. °∞How can you sleep at a time like this?°± he shouted. °∞Get up and pray to your god! Maybe he will pay attention to us and spare our lives.°±
32Jnh 1:7 Then the crew cast lots to see which of them had offended the gods and caused the terrible storm. When they did this, the lots identified Jonah as the culprit. 
32Jnh 1:8 °∞Why has this awful storm come down on us?°± they demanded. °∞Who are you? What is your line of work? What country are you from? What is your nationality?°±
32Jnh 1:9 Jonah answered, °∞I am a Hebrew, and I worship the Lord, the God of heaven, who made the sea and the land.°±
32Jnh 1:10 The sailors were terrified when they heard this, for he had already told them he was running away from the Lord. °∞Oh, why did you do it?°± they groaned. 
32Jnh 1:11 And since the storm was getting worse all the time, they asked him, °∞What should we do to you to stop this storm?°±
32Jnh 1:12 °∞Throw me into the sea,°± Jonah said, °∞and it will become calm again. I know that this terrible storm is all my fault.°±
32Jnh 1:13 Instead, the sailors rowed even harder to get the ship to the land. But the stormy sea was too violent for them, and they couldn°Øt make it. 
32Jnh 1:14 Then they cried out to the Lord, Jonah°Øs God. °∞O Lord,°± they pleaded, °∞don°Øt make us die for this man°Øs sin. And don°Øt hold us responsible for his death. O Lord, you have sent this storm upon him for your own good reasons.°±
32Jnh 1:15 Then the sailors picked Jonah up and threw him into the raging sea, and the storm stopped at once! 
32Jnh 1:16 The sailors were awestruck by the Lord°Øs great power, and they offered him a sacrifice and vowed to serve him.
32Jnh 1:17 ®ÁNow the Lord had arranged for a great fish to swallow Jonah. And Jonah was inside the fish for three days and three nights. / ®ÁVerse 1.17 is numbered 2.1 in Hebrew text.
32Jnh 2:1 ®ÁThen Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from inside the fish. / ®ÁVerses 2.1-10 are numbered 2.2-11 in Hebrew text.
32Jnh 2:2 He said, °∞I cried out to the Lord in my great trouble, and he answered me. I called to you from the land of the dead®Á, and Lord, you heard me! / ®ÁHebrew from Sheol.
32Jnh 2:3 You threw me into the ocean depths, and I sank down to the heart of the sea. The mighty waters engulfed me; I was buried beneath your wild and stormy waves.
32Jnh 2:4 Then I said, °ÆO Lord, you have driven me from your presence. Yet I will look once more toward your holy Temple.°Ø
32Jnh 2:5 °∞I sank beneath the waves, and the waters closed over me. Seaweed wrapped itself around my head.
32Jnh 2:6 I sank down to the very roots of the mountains. I was imprisoned in the earth, whose gates lock shut forever. But you, O Lord my God, snatched me from the jaws of death!
32Jnh 2:7 As my life was slipping away, I remembered the Lord. And my earnest prayer went out to you in your holy Temple.
32Jnh 2:8 Those who worship false gods turn their backs on all God°Øs mercies.
32Jnh 2:9 But I will offer sacrifices to you with songs of praise, and I will fulfill all my vows. For my salvation comes from the Lord alone.°±
32Jnh 2:10 Then the Lord ordered the fish to spit Jonah out onto the beach.
32Jnh 3:1 Then the Lord spoke to Jonah a second time£∫ 
32Jnh 3:2 °∞Get up and go to the great city of Nineveh, and deliver the message I have given you.°±
32Jnh 3:3 This time Jonah obeyed the Lord°Øs command and went to Nineveh, a city so large that it took three days to see it all®Á. / ®ÁHebrew a great city to God, of three days°Ø journey.
32Jnh 3:4 On the day Jonah entered the city, he shouted to the crowds£∫ °∞Forty days from now Nineveh will be destroyed!°± 
32Jnh 3:5 The people of Nineveh believed God°Øs message, and from the greatest to the least, they declared a fast and put on burlap to show their sorrow.
32Jnh 3:6 When the king of Nineveh heard what Jonah was saying, he stepped down from his throne and took off his royal robes. He dressed himself in burlap and sat on a heap of ashes. 
32Jnh 3:7 Then the king and his nobles sent this decree throughout the city. °∞No one, not even the animals from your herds and flocks, may eat or drink anything at all. 
32Jnh 3:8 People and animals alike must wear garments of mourning, and everyone must pray earnestly to God. They must turn from their evil ways and stop all their violence. 
32Jnh 3:9 Who can tell? Perhaps even yet God will change his mind and hold back his fierce anger from destroying us.°±
32Jnh 3:10 When God saw what they had done and how they had put a stop to their evil ways, he changed his mind and did not carry out the destruction he had threatened.
32Jnh 4:1 This change of plans greatly upset Jonah, and he became very angry. 
32Jnh 4:2 So he complained to the Lord about it£∫ °∞Didn°Øt I say before I left home that you would do this, Lord? That is why I ran away to Tarshish! I knew that you are a merciful and compassionate God, slow to get angry and filled with unfailing love. You are eager to turn back from destroying people. 
32Jnh 4:3 Just kill me now, Lord! I°Ød rather be dead than alive if what I predicted will not happen.°±
32Jnh 4:4 The Lord replied, °∞Is it right for you to be angry about this?°±
32Jnh 4:5 Then Jonah went out to the east side of the city and made a shelter to sit under as he waited to see what would happen to the city. 
32Jnh 4:6 And the Lord God arranged for a leafy plant to grow there, and soon it spread its broad leaves over Jonah°Øs head, shading him from the sun. This eased his discomfort, and Jonah was very grateful for the plant.
32Jnh 4:7 But God also arranged for a worm! The next morning at dawn the worm ate through the stem of the plant so that it withered away. 
32Jnh 4:8 And as the sun grew hot, God arranged for a scorching east wind to blow on Jonah. The sun beat down on his head until he grew faint and wished to die. °∞Death is certainly better than living like this!°± he exclaimed.
32Jnh 4:9 Then God said to Jonah, °∞Is it right for you to be angry because the plant died?°± °∞Yes,°± Jonah retorted, °∞even angry enough to die!°±
32Jnh 4:10 Then the Lord said, °∞You feel sorry about the plant, though you did nothing to put it there. It came quickly and died quickly. 
32Jnh 4:11 But Nineveh has more than 120,000 people living in spiritual darkness®Á, not to mention all the animals. Shouldn°Øt I feel sorry for such a great city?°± / ®ÁHebrew people who don°Øt know their right hand from their left.

33Mc 1:1 The Lord gave this message to Micah of Moresheth during the years when Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah were kings of Judah. The visions he saw concerned both Samaria and Jerusalem.
33Mc 1:2 Attention! Let all the people of the world listen! Let the earth and everything in it hear. The Sovereign Lord is making accusations against you; the Lord speaks from his holy Temple.
33Mc 1:3 Look! The Lord is coming! He leaves his throne in heaven and tramples the heights of the earth.
33Mc 1:4 The mountains melt beneath his feet and flow into the valleys like wax in a fire, like water pouring down a hill.
33Mc 1:5 And why is this happening? Because of the rebellion of Israel®Á - yes, the sins of the whole nation. Who is to blame for Israel°Øs rebellion? Samaria, its capital city! Where is the center of idolatry in Judah? In Jerusalem, its capital! / ®ÁHebrew Jacob; also in 1.5b. The names °∞Jacob°± and °∞Israel°± are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation.
33Mc 1:6 °∞So I, the Lord, will make the city of Samaria a heap of ruins. Her streets will be plowed up for planting vineyards. I will roll the stones of her walls into the valley below, exposing her foundations.
33Mc 1:7 All her carved images will be smashed. All her sacred treasures will be burned. These things were bought with the money earned by her prostitution, and they will now be carried away to pay prostitutes elsewhere.°±
33Mc 1:8 Therefore, I will mourn and lament. I will walk around barefoot and naked. I will howl like a jackal and moan like an owl.
33Mc 1:9 For my people°Øs wound is too deep to heal. It has reached into Judah, even to the gates of Jerusalem.
33Mc 1:10 Don°Øt tell our enemies in Gath®Á; don°Øt weep at all. You people in Beth-leaphrah®Ë, roll in the dust to show your despair. / ®ÁGath sounds like the Hebrew term for °∞tell.°± ®ËBeth-leaphrah means °∞house of dust.°±
33Mc 1:11 You people in Shaphir®Á, go as captives into exile - naked and ashamed. The people of Zaanan®Ë dare not come outside their walls. The people of Beth-ezel®È mourn, for their house has no support. / ®ÁShaphir means °∞pleasant.°± ®ËZaanan sounds like the Hebrew term for °∞come out.°± ®ÈBeth-ezel means °∞adjoining house.°±
33Mc 1:12 The people of Maroth®Á anxiously wait for relief, but only bitterness awaits them as the Lord°Øs judgment reaches even to the gates of Jerusalem. / ®ÁMaroth sounds like the Hebrew term for °∞bitter.°±
33Mc 1:13 Harness your chariot horses and flee, you people of Lachish®Á. You were the first city in Judah to follow Israel in her rebellion, and you led Jerusalem®Ë into sin. / ®ÁLachish sounds like the Hebrew term for °∞team of horses.°± ®ËHebrew the daughter of Zion.
33Mc 1:14 Send farewell gifts to Moresheth-gath®Á; there is no hope of saving it. The town of Aczib®Ë has deceived the kings of Israel. / ®ÁMoresheth sounds like the Hebrew term for °∞gift°± or °∞dowry.°± ®ËAczib means °∞deception.°±
33Mc 1:15 O people of Mareshah®Á, I will bring a conqueror to capture your town. And the leaders®Ë of Israel will go to Adullam. / ®ÁMareshah sounds like the Hebrew term for °∞conqueror.°± ®ËHebrew the glory.
33Mc 1:16 Oh, people of Judah, shave your heads in sorrow, for the children you love will be snatched away. Make yourselves as bald as a vulture, for your little ones will be exiled to distant lands.
33Mc 2:1 What sorrow awaits you who lie awake at night, thinking up evil plans. You rise at dawn and hurry to carry them out, simply because you have the power to do so.
33Mc 2:2 When you want a piece of land, you find a way to seize it. When you want someone°Øs house, you take it by fraud and violence. You cheat a man of his property, stealing his family°Øs inheritance.
33Mc 2:3 But this is what the Lord says. °∞I will reward your evil with evil; you won°Øt be able to pull your neck out of the noose. You will no longer walk around proudly, for it will be a terrible time.°±
33Mc 2:4 In that day your enemies will make fun of you by singing this song of despair about you. °∞We are finished, completely ruined! God has confiscated our land, taking it from us. He has given our fields to those who betrayed us®Á.°± / ®ÁOr to those who took us captive.
33Mc 2:5 Others will set your boundaries then, and the Lord°Øs people will have no say in how the land is divided.
33Mc 2:6 °∞Don°Øt say such things,°± the people respond®Á. °∞Don°Øt prophesy like that. Such disasters will never come our way!°± / ®ÁOr the prophets respond; Hebrew reads they prophesy.
33Mc 2:7 Should you talk that way, O family of Israel?®Á Will the Lord°Øs Spirit have patience with such behavior? If you would do what is right, you would find my words comforting. / ®ÁHebrew O house of Jacob? See note on 1.5a.
33Mc 2:8 Yet to this very hour my people rise against me like an enemy! You steal the shirts right off the backs of those who trusted you, making them as ragged as men returning from battle.
33Mc 2:9 You have evicted women from their pleasant homes and forever stripped their children of all that God would give them.
33Mc 2:10 Up! Begone! This is no longer your land and home, for you have filled it with sin and ruined it completely.
33Mc 2:11 Suppose a prophet full of lies would say to you, °∞I°Øll preach to you the joys of wine and alcohol!°± That°Øs just the kind of prophet you would like!
33Mc 2:12 °∞Someday, O Israel, I will gather you; I will gather the remnant who are left. I will bring you together again like sheep in a pen, like a flock in its pasture. Yes, your land will again be filled with noisy crowds!
33Mc 2:13 Your leader will break out and lead you out of exile, out through the gates of the enemy cities, back to your own land. Your king will lead you; the Lord himself will guide you.°±
33Mc 3:1 I said, °∞Listen, you leaders of Israel! You are supposed to know right from wrong,
33Mc 3:2 but you are the very ones who hate good and love evil. You skin my people alive and tear the flesh from their bones.
33Mc 3:3 Yes, you eat my people°Øs flesh, strip off their skin, and break their bones. You chop them up like meat for the cooking pot.
33Mc 3:4 Then you beg the Lord for help in times of trouble! Do you really expect him to answer? After all the evil you have done, he won°Øt even look at you!°±
33Mc 3:5 This is what the Lord says. °∞You false prophets are leading my people astray! You promise peace for those who give you food, but you declare war on those who refuse to feed you.
33Mc 3:6 Now the night will close around you, cutting off all your visions. Darkness will cover you, putting an end to your predictions. The sun will set for you prophets, and your day will come to an end.
33Mc 3:7 Then you seers will be put to shame, and you fortune-tellers will be disgraced. And you will cover your faces because there is no answer from God.°±
33Mc 3:8 But as for me, I am filled with power - with the Spirit of the Lord. I am filled with justice and strength to boldly declare Israel°Øs sin and rebellion.
33Mc 3:9 Listen to me, you leaders of Israel! You hate justice and twist all that is right.
33Mc 3:10 You are building Jerusalem on a foundation of murder and corruption.
33Mc 3:11 You rulers make decisions based on bribes; you priests teach God°Øs laws only for a price; you prophets won°Øt prophesy unless you are paid. Yet all of you claim to depend on the Lord. °∞No harm can come to us,°± you say, °∞for the Lord is here among us.°±
33Mc 3:12 Because of you, Mount Zion will be plowed like an open field; Jerusalem will be reduced to ruins! A thicket will grow on the heights where the Temple now stands.
33Mc 4:1 In the last days, the mountain of the Lord°Øs house will be the highest of all - the most important place on earth. It will be raised above the other hills, and people from all over the world will stream there to worship.
33Mc 4:2 People from many nations will come and say, °∞Come, let us go up to the mountain of the Lord, to the house of Jacob°Øs God. There he will teach us his ways, and we will walk in his paths.°± For the Lord°Øs teaching will go out from Zion; his word will go out from Jerusalem.
33Mc 4:3 The Lord will mediate between peoples and will settle disputes between strong nations far away. They will hammer their swords into plowshares and their spears into pruning hooks. Nation will no longer fight against nation, nor train for war anymore.
33Mc 4:4 Everyone will live in peace and prosperity, enjoying their own grapevines and fig trees, for there will be nothing to fear. The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has made this promise!
33Mc 4:5 Though the nations around us follow their idols, we will follow the Lord our God forever and ever.
33Mc 4:6 °∞In that coming day,°± says the Lord, °∞I will gather together those who are lame, those who have been exiles, and those whom I have filled with grief.
33Mc 4:7 Those who are weak will survive as a remnant; those who were exiles will become a strong nation. Then I, the Lord, will rule from Jerusalem®Á as their king forever.°±/ ®ÁHebrew Mount Zion.
33Mc 4:8 As for you, Jerusalem, the citadel of God°Øs people®Á, your royal might and power will come back to you again. The kingship will be restored to my precious Jerusalem. / ®ÁHebrew As for you, Migdal-eder, the Ophel of the daughter of Zion.
33Mc 4:9 But why are you now screaming in terror? Have you no king to lead you? Have your wise people all died? Pain has gripped you like a woman in childbirth.
33Mc 4:10 Writhe and groan like a woman in labor, you people of Jerusalem®Á, for now you must leave this city to live in the open country. You will soon be sent in exile to distant Babylon. But the Lord will rescue you there; he will redeem you from the grip of your enemies. / ®ÁHebrew O daughter of Zion.
33Mc 4:11 Now many nations have gathered against you. °∞Let her be desecrated,°± they say. °∞Let us see the destruction of Jerusalem®Á.°± / ®ÁHebrew of Zion.
33Mc 4:12 But they do not know the Lord°Øs thoughts or understand his plan. These nations don°Øt know that he is gathering them together to be beaten and trampled like sheaves of grain on a threshing floor.
33Mc 4:13 °∞Rise up and crush the nations, O Jerusalem!°±®Á says the Lord. °∞For I will give you iron horns and bronze hooves, so you can trample many nations to pieces. You will present their stolen riches to the Lord, their wealth to the Lord of all the earth.°± / ®ÁHebrew °∞Rise up and thresh, O daughter of Zion.°±
33Mc 5:1 ®ÁMobilize! Marshal your troops! The enemy is laying siege to Jerusalem. They will strike Israel°Øs leader in the face with a rod. / ®ÁVerse 5.1 is numbered 4.14 in Hebrew text.
33Mc 5:2 ®ÁBut you, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, are only a small village among all the people of Judah. Yet a ruler of Israel will come from you, one whose origins are from the distant past. / ®ÁVerses 5.2-15 are numbered 5.1-14 in Hebrew text.
33Mc 5:3 The people of Israel will be abandoned to their enemies until the woman in labor gives birth. Then at last his fellow countrymen will return from exile to their own land.
33Mc 5:4 And he will stand to lead his flock with the Lord°Øs strength, in the majesty of the name of the Lord his God. Then his people will live there undisturbed, for he will be highly honored around the world.
33Mc 5:5 And he will be the source of peace. When the Assyrians invade our land and break through our defenses, we will appoint seven rulers to watch over us, eight princes to lead us.
33Mc 5:6 They will rule Assyria with drawn swords and enter the gates of the land of Nimrod. He will rescue us from the Assyrians when they pour over the borders to invade our land.
33Mc 5:7 Then the remnant left in Israel®Á will take their place among the nations. They will be like dew sent by the Lord or like rain falling on the grass, which no one can hold back and no one can restrain. / ®ÁHebrew in Jacob; also in 5.8. See note on 1.5a.
33Mc 5:8 The remnant left in Israel will take their place among the nations. They will be like a lion among the animals of the forest, like a strong young lion among flocks of sheep and goats, pouncing and tearing as they go with no rescuer in sight.
33Mc 5:9 The people of Israel will stand up to their foes, and all their enemies will be wiped out.
33Mc 5:10 °∞In that day,°± says the Lord, °∞I will slaughter your horses and destroy your chariots.
33Mc 5:11 I will tear down your walls and demolish your defenses.
33Mc 5:12 I will put an end to all witchcraft, and there will be no more fortune-tellers.
33Mc 5:13 I will destroy all your idols and sacred pillars, so you will never again worship the work of your own hands.
33Mc 5:14 I will abolish your idol shrines with their Asherah poles and destroy your pagan cities.
33Mc 5:15 I will pour out my vengeance on all the nations that refuse to obey me.°±
33Mc 6:1 Listen to what the Lord is saying. °∞Stand up and state your case against me. Let the mountains and hills be called to witness your complaints.
33Mc 6:2 And now, O mountains, listen to the Lord°Øs complaint! He has a case against his people. He will bring charges against Israel.
33Mc 6:3 °∞O my people, what have I done to you? What have I done to make you tired of me? Answer me!
33Mc 6:4 For I brought you out of Egypt and redeemed you from slavery. I sent Moses, Aaron, and Miriam to help you.
33Mc 6:5 Don°Øt you remember, my people, how King Balak of Moab tried to have you cursed and how Balaam son of Beor blessed you instead? And remember your journey from Acacia Grove®Á to Gilgal, when I, the Lord, did everything I could to teach you about my faithfulness.°± / ®ÁHebrew Shittim.
33Mc 6:6 What can we bring to the Lord? What kind of offerings should we give him? Should we bow before God with offerings of yearling calves?
33Mc 6:7 Should we offer him thousands of rams and ten thousand rivers of olive oil? Should we sacrifice our firstborn children to pay for our sins?
33Mc 6:8 No, O people, the Lord has told you what is good, and this is what he requires of you. to do what is right, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God.
33Mc 6:9 Fear the Lord if you are wise! His voice calls to everyone in Jerusalem. °∞The armies of destruction are coming; the Lord is sending them®Á. / ®ÁHebrew °∞Listen to the rod. / Who appointed it?°±
33Mc 6:10 What shall I say about the homes of the wicked filled with treasures gained by cheating? What about the disgusting practice of measuring out grain with dishonest measures?®Á / ®ÁHebrew of using the short ephah? The ephah was a unit for measuring grain.
33Mc 6:11 How can I tolerate your merchants who use dishonest scales and weights?
33Mc 6:12 The rich among you have become wealthy through extortion and violence. Your citizens are so used to lying that their tongues can no longer tell the truth.
33Mc 6:13 °∞Therefore, I will wound you! I will bring you to ruin for all your sins.
33Mc 6:14 You will eat but never have enough. Your hunger pangs and emptiness will remain. And though you try to save your money, it will come to nothing in the end. You will save a little, but I will give it to those who conquer you.
33Mc 6:15 You will plant crops but not harvest them. You will press your olives but not get enough oil to anoint yourselves. You will trample the grapes but get no juice to make your wine.
33Mc 6:16 You keep only the laws of evil King Omri; you follow only the example of wicked King Ahab! Therefore, I will make an example of you, bringing you to complete ruin. You will be treated with contempt, mocked by all who see you.°±
33Mc 7:1 How miserable I am! I feel like the fruit picker after the harvest who can find nothing to eat. Not a cluster of grapes or a single early fig can be found to satisfy my hunger.
33Mc 7:2 The godly people have all disappeared; not one honest person is left on the earth. They are all murderers, setting traps even for their own brothers.
33Mc 7:3 Both their hands are equally skilled at doing evil! Officials and judges alike demand bribes. The people with influence get what they want, and together they scheme to twist justice.
33Mc 7:4 Even the best of them is like a brier; the most honest is as dangerous as a hedge of thorns. But your judgment day is coming swiftly now. Your time of punishment is here, a time of confusion.
33Mc 7:5 Don°Øt trust anyone - not your best friend or even your wife!
33Mc 7:6 For the son despises his father. The daughter defies her mother. The daughter-in-law defies her mother-in-law. Your enemies are right in your own household!
33Mc 7:7 As for me, I look to the Lord for help. I wait confidently for God to save me, and my God will certainly hear me.
33Mc 7:8 Do not gloat over me, my enemies! For though I fall, I will rise again. Though I sit in darkness, the Lord will be my light.
33Mc 7:9 I will be patient as the Lord punishes me, for I have sinned against him. But after that, he will take up my case and give me justice for all I have suffered from my enemies. The Lord will bring me into the light, and I will see his righteousness.
33Mc 7:10 Then my enemies will see that the Lord is on my side. They will be ashamed that they taunted me, saying, °∞So where is the Lord - that God of yours?°± With my own eyes I will see their downfall; they will be trampled like mud in the streets.
33Mc 7:11 In that day, Israel, your cities will be rebuilt, and your borders will be extended.
33Mc 7:12 People from many lands will come and honor you - from Assyria all the way to the towns of Egypt, from Egypt all the way to the Euphrates River®Á, and from distant seas and mountains. / ®ÁHebrew the river.
33Mc 7:13 But the land®Á will become empty and desolate because of the wickedness of those who live there. / ®ÁOr earth.
33Mc 7:14 O Lord, protect your people with your shepherd°Øs staff; lead your flock, your special possession. Though they live alone in a thicket on the heights of Mount Carmel®Á, let them graze in the fertile pastures of Bashan and Gilead as they did long ago. / ®ÁOr surrounded by a fruitful land.
33Mc 7:15 °∞Yes,°± says the Lord, °∞I will do mighty miracles for you, like those I did when I rescued you from slavery in Egypt.°±
33Mc 7:16 All the nations of the world will stand amazed at what the Lord will do for you. They will be embarrassed at their feeble power. They will cover their mouths in silent awe, deaf to everything around them.
33Mc 7:17 Like snakes crawling from their holes, they will come out to meet the Lord our God. They will fear him greatly, trembling in terror at his presence.
33Mc 7:18 Where is another God like you, who pardons the guilt of the remnant, overlooking the sins of his special people? You will not stay angry with your people forever, because you delight in showing unfailing love.
33Mc 7:19 Once again you will have compassion on us. You will trample our sins under your feet and throw them into the depths of the ocean!
33Mc 7:20 You will show us your faithfulness and unfailing love as you promised to our ancestors Abraham and Jacob long ago.

34Nah 1:1 This message concerning Nineveh came as a vision to Nahum, who lived in Elkosh.
34Nah 1:2 The Lord is a jealous God, filled with vengeance and rage. He takes revenge on all who oppose him and continues to rage against his enemies!
34Nah 1:3 The Lord is slow to get angry, but his power is great, and he never lets the guilty go unpunished. He displays his power in the whirlwind and the storm. The billowing clouds are the dust beneath his feet.
34Nah 1:4 At his command the oceans dry up, and the rivers disappear. The lush pastures of Bashan and Carmel fade, and the green forests of Lebanon wither.
34Nah 1:5 In his presence the mountains quake, and the hills melt away; the earth trembles, and its people are destroyed.
34Nah 1:6 Who can stand before his fierce anger? Who can survive his burning fury? His rage blazes forth like fire, and the mountains crumble to dust in his presence.
34Nah 1:7 The Lord is good, a strong refuge when trouble comes. He is close to those who trust in him.
34Nah 1:8 But he will sweep away his enemies in an overwhelming flood. He will pursue his foes into the darkness of night.
34Nah 1:9 Why are you scheming against the Lord? He will destroy you with one blow; he won°Øt need to strike twice!
34Nah 1:10 His enemies, tangled like thornbushes and staggering like drunks, will be burned up like dry stubble in a field.
34Nah 1:11 Who is this wicked counselor of yours who plots evil against the Lord?
34Nah 1:12 This is what the Lord says. °∞Though the Assyrians have many allies, they will be destroyed and disappear. O my people, I have punished you before, but I will not punish you again.
34Nah 1:13 Now I will break the yoke of bondage from your neck and tear off the chains of Assyrian oppression.°±
34Nah 1:14 And this is what the Lord says concerning the Assyrians in Nineveh. °∞You will have no more children to carry on your name. I will destroy all the idols in the temples of your gods. I am preparing a grave for you because you are despicable!°±
34Nah 1:15 ®ÁLook! A messenger is coming over the mountains with good news! He is bringing a message of peace. Celebrate your festivals, O people of Judah, and fulfill all your vows, for your wicked enemies will never invade your land again. They will be completely destroyed! / ®ÁVerse 1.15 is numbered 2.1 in Hebrew text.
34Nah 2:1 ®ÁYour enemy is coming to crush you, Nineveh. Man the ramparts! Watch the roads! Prepare your defenses! Call out your forces! / ®ÁVerses 2.1-13 are numbered 2.2-14 in Hebrew text.
34Nah 2:2 Even though the destroyer has destroyed Judah, the Lord will restore its honor. Israel°Øs vine has been stripped of branches, but he will restore its splendor.
34Nah 2:3 Shields flash red in the sunlight! See the scarlet uniforms of the valiant troops! Watch as their glittering chariots move into position, with a forest of spears waving above them.
34Nah 2:4 The chariots race recklessly along the streets and rush wildly through the squares. They flash like firelight and move as swiftly as lightning.
34Nah 2:5 The king shouts to his officers; they stumble in their haste, rushing to the walls to set up their defenses.
34Nah 2:6 The river gates have been torn open! The palace is about to collapse!
34Nah 2:7 Nineveh°Øs exile has been decreed, and all the servant girls mourn its capture. They moan like doves and beat their breasts in sorrow.
34Nah 2:8 Nineveh is like a leaking water reservoir! The people are slipping away. °∞Stop, stop!°± someone shouts, but no one even looks back.
34Nah 2:9 Loot the silver! Plunder the gold! There°Øs no end to Nineveh°Øs treasures - its vast, uncounted wealth.
34Nah 2:10 Soon the city is plundered, empty, and ruined. Hearts melt and knees shake. The people stand aghast, their faces pale and trembling.
34Nah 2:11 Where now is that great Nineveh, that den filled with young lions? It was a place where people - like lions and their cubs - walked freely and without fear.
34Nah 2:12 The lion tore up meat for his cubs and strangled prey for his mate. He filled his den with prey, his caverns with his plunder.
34Nah 2:13 °∞I am your enemy!°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. °∞Your chariots will soon go up in smoke. Your young men®Á will be killed in battle. Never again will you plunder conquered nations. The voices of your proud messengers will be heard no more.°± / ®ÁHebrew young lions.
34Nah 3:1 What sorrow awaits Nineveh, the city of murder and lies! She is crammed with wealth and is never without victims.
34Nah 3:2 Hear the crack of whips, the rumble of wheels! Horses°Ø hooves pound, and chariots clatter wildly.
34Nah 3:3 See the flashing swords and glittering spears as the charioteers charge past! There are countless casualties, heaps of bodies - so many bodies that people stumble over them.
34Nah 3:4 All this because Nineveh, the beautiful and faithless city, mistress of deadly charms, enticed the nations with her beauty. She taught them all her magic, enchanting people everywhere.
34Nah 3:5 °∞I am your enemy!°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. °∞And now I will lift your skirts and show all the earth your nakedness and shame.
34Nah 3:6 I will cover you with filth and show the world how vile you really are.
34Nah 3:7 All who see you will shrink back and say, °ÆNineveh lies in ruins. Where are the mourners?°Ø Does anyone regret your destruction?°±
34Nah 3:8 Are you any better than the city of Thebes®Á, situated on the Nile River, surrounded by water? She was protected by the river on all sides, walled in by water. / ®ÁHebrew No-amon; also in 3.10.
34Nah 3:9 Ethiopia®Á and the land of Egypt gave unlimited assistance. The nations of Put and Libya were among her allies. / ®ÁHebrew Cush.
34Nah 3:10 Yet Thebes fell, and her people were led away as captives. Her babies were dashed to death against the stones of the streets. Soldiers threw dice®Á to get Egyptian officers as servants. All their leaders were bound in chains. / ®ÁHebrew They cast lots.
34Nah 3:11 And you, Nineveh, will also stagger like a drunkard. You will hide for fear of the attacking enemy.
34Nah 3:12 All your fortresses will fall. They will be devoured like the ripe figs that fall into the mouths of those who shake the trees.
34Nah 3:13 Your troops will be as weak and helpless as women. The gates of your land will be opened wide to the enemy and set on fire and burned.
34Nah 3:14 Get ready for the siege! Store up water! Strengthen the defenses! Go into the pits to trample clay, and pack it into molds, making bricks to repair the walls.
34Nah 3:15 But the fire will devour you; the sword will cut you down. The enemy will consume you like locusts, devouring everything they see. There will be no escape, even if you multiply like swarming locusts.
34Nah 3:16 Your merchants have multiplied until they outnumber the stars. But like a swarm of locusts, they strip the land and fly away.
34Nah 3:17 Your guards®Á and officials are also like swarming locusts that crowd together in the hedges on a cold day. But like locusts that fly away when the sun comes up, all of them will fly away and disappear. / ®ÁOr princes.
34Nah 3:18 Your shepherds are asleep, O Assyrian king; your princes lie dead in the dust. Your people are scattered across the mountains with no one to gather them together.
34Nah 3:19 There is no healing for your wound; your injury is fatal. All who hear of your destruction will clap their hands for joy. Where can anyone be found who has not suffered from your continual cruelty?
35
35Hab 1:1 This is the message that the prophet Habakkuk received in a vision.
35Hab 1:2 How long, O Lord, must I call for help? But you do not listen! °∞Violence is everywhere!°± I cry, but you do not come to save.
35Hab 1:3 Must I forever see these evil deeds? Why must I watch all this misery? Wherever I look, I see destruction and violence. I am surrounded by people who love to argue and fight.
35Hab 1:4 The law has become paralyzed, and there is no justice in the courts. The wicked far outnumber the righteous, so that justice has become perverted.
35Hab 1:5 The Lord replied, °∞Look around at the nations; look and be amazed!®Á For I am doing something in your own day, something you wouldn°Øt believe even if someone told you about it. / ®ÁGreek version reads Look you mockers; / look and be amazed and die. Compare Acts 13.41.
35Hab 1:6 I am raising up the Babylonians®Á, a cruel and violent people. They will march across the world and conquer other lands. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans.
35Hab 1:7 They are notorious for their cruelty and do whatever they like.
35Hab 1:8 Their horses are swifter than cheetahs®Á and fiercer than wolves at dusk. Their charioteers charge from far away. Like eagles, they swoop down to devour their prey. / ®ÁOr leopards.
35Hab 1:9 °∞On they come, all bent on violence. Their hordes advance like a desert wind, sweeping captives ahead of them like sand.
35Hab 1:10 They scoff at kings and princes and scorn all their fortresses. They simply pile ramps of earth against their walls and capture them!
35Hab 1:11 They sweep past like the wind and are gone. But they are deeply guilty, for their own strength is their god.°±
35Hab 1:12 O Lord my God, my Holy One, you who are eternal - surely you do not plan to wipe us out? O Lord, our Rock, you have sent these Babylonians to correct us, to punish us for our many sins.
35Hab 1:13 But you are pure and cannot stand the sight of evil. Will you wink at their treachery? Should you be silent while the wicked swallow up people more righteous than they?
35Hab 1:14 Are we only fish to be caught and killed? Are we only sea creatures that have no leader?
35Hab 1:15 Must we be strung up on their hooks and caught in their nets while they rejoice and celebrate?
35Hab 1:16 Then they will worship their nets and burn incense in front of them. °∞These nets are the gods who have made us rich!°± they will claim.
35Hab 1:17 Will you let them get away with this forever? Will they succeed forever in their heartless conquests?
35Hab 2:1 I will climb up to my watchtower and stand at my guardpost. There I will wait to see what the Lord says and how he®Á will answer my complaint. / ®ÁAs in Syriac version; Hebrew reads I.
35Hab 2:2 Then the Lord said to me, °∞Write my answer plainly on tablets, so that a runner can carry the correct message to others.
35Hab 2:3 This vision is for a future time. It describes the end, and it will be fulfilled. If it seems slow in coming, wait patiently, for it will surely take place. It will not be delayed.
35Hab 2:4 °∞Look at the proud! They trust in themselves, and their lives are crooked. But the righteous will live by their faithfulness to God®Á. / ®ÁGreek version reads If the vision is delayed, wait patiently, for it will surely come and not delay. 4I will take no pleasure in anyone who turns away. But the righteous person will live by my faith. Compare Rom 1.17; Gal 3.11; Heb 10.37-38.
35Hab 2:5 Wealth®Á is treacherous, and the arrogant are never at rest. They open their mouths as wide as the grave®Á,®Á and like death, they are never satisfied. In their greed they have gathered up many nations and swallowed many peoples. / ®ÁAs in Dead Sea Scroll 1QpHab; other Hebrew manuscripts read Wine. ®ËHebrew as Sheol.
35Hab 2:6 °∞But soon their captives will taunt them. They will mock them, saying, °ÆWhat sorrow awaits you thieves! Now you will get what you deserve! You°Øve become rich by extortion, but how much longer can this go on?°Ø
35Hab 2:7 Suddenly, your debtors will take action. They will turn on you and take all you have, while you stand trembling and helpless.
35Hab 2:8 Because you have plundered many nations; now all the survivors will plunder you. You committed murder throughout the countryside and filled the towns with violence.
35Hab 2:9 °∞What sorrow awaits you who build big houses with money gained dishonestly! You believe your wealth will buy security, putting your family°Øs nest beyond the reach of danger.
35Hab 2:10 But by the murders you committed, you have shamed your name and forfeited your lives.
35Hab 2:11 The very stones in the walls cry out against you, and the beams in the ceilings echo the complaint.
35Hab 2:12 °∞What sorrow awaits you who build cities with money gained through murder and corruption!
35Hab 2:13 Has not the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies promised that the wealth of nations will turn to ashes? They work so hard, but all in vain!
35Hab 2:14 For as the waters fill the sea, the earth will be filled with an awareness of the glory of the Lord.
35Hab 2:15 °∞What sorrow awaits you who make your neighbors drunk! You force your cup on them so you can gloat over their shameful nakedness.
35Hab 2:16 But soon it will be your turn to be disgraced. Come, drink and be exposed! Drink from the cup of the Lord°Øs judgment, and all your glory will be turned to shame.
35Hab 2:17 You cut down the forests of Lebanon. Now you will be cut down. You destroyed the wild animals, so now their terror will be yours. You committed murder throughout the countryside and filled the towns with violence.
35Hab 2:18 °∞What good is an idol carved by man, or a cast image that deceives you? How foolish to trust in your own creation - a god that can°Øt even talk!
35Hab 2:19 What sorrow awaits you who say to wooden idols, °ÆWake up and save us!°Ø To speechless stone images you say, °ÆRise up and teach us!°Ø Can an idol tell you what to do? They may be overlaid with gold and silver, but they are lifeless inside.
35Hab 2:20 But the Lord is in his holy Temple. Let all the earth be silent before him.°±
35Hab 3:1 This prayer was sung by the prophet Habakkuk®Á. / ®ÁHebrew adds according to shigionoth, probably indicating the musical setting for the prayer.
35Hab 3:2 I have heard all about you, Lord. I am filled with awe by your amazing works. In this time of our deep need, help us again as you did in years gone by. And in your anger, remember your mercy.
35Hab 3:3 I see God moving across the deserts from Edom®Á, the Holy One coming from Mount Paran®Ë. His brilliant splendor fills the heavens, and the earth is filled with his praise. / ®ÁHebrew Teman. ®ËHebrew adds selah; also in 3.9, 13. The meaning of this Hebrew term is uncertain; it is probably a musical or literary term.
35Hab 3:4 His coming is as brilliant as the sunrise. Rays of light flash from his hands, where his awesome power is hidden.
35Hab 3:5 Pestilence marches before him; plague follows close behind.
35Hab 3:6 When he stops, the earth shakes. When he looks, the nations tremble. He shatters the everlasting mountains and levels the eternal hills. He is the Eternal One!
35Hab 3:7 I see the people of Cushan in distress, and the nation of Midian trembling in terror.
35Hab 3:8 Was it in anger, Lord, that you struck the rivers and parted the sea? Were you displeased with them? No, you were sending your chariots of salvation!
35Hab 3:9 You brandished your bow and your quiver of arrows. You split open the earth with flowing rivers.
35Hab 3:10 The mountains watched and trembled. Onward swept the raging waters. The mighty deep cried out, lifting its hands to the Lord.
35Hab 3:11 The sun and moon stood still in the sky as your brilliant arrows flew and your glittering spear flashed.
35Hab 3:12 You marched across the land in anger and trampled the nations in your fury.
35Hab 3:13 You went out to rescue your chosen people, to save your anointed ones. You crushed the heads of the wicked and stripped their bones from head to toe.
35Hab 3:14 With his own weapons, you destroyed the chief of those who rushed out like a whirlwind, thinking Israel would be easy prey.
35Hab 3:15 You trampled the sea with your horses, and the mighty waters piled high.
35Hab 3:16 I trembled inside when I heard this; my lips quivered with fear. My legs gave way beneath me®Á, and I shook in terror. I will wait quietly for the coming day when disaster will strike the people who invade us. / ®ÁHebrew Decay entered my bones.
35Hab 3:17 Even though the fig trees have no blossoms, and there are no grapes on the vines; even though the olive crop fails, and the fields lie empty and barren; even though the flocks die in the fields, and the cattle barns are empty,
35Hab 3:18 yet I will rejoice in the Lord! I will be joyful in the God of my salvation!
35Hab 3:19 The Sovereign Lord is my strength! He makes me as surefooted as a deer®Á, able to tread upon the heights. (For the choir director£∫ This prayer is to be accompanied by stringed instruments.) / ®ÁOr He gives me the speed of a deer.
36
36Zph 1:1 The Lord gave this message to Zephaniah when Josiah son of Amon was king of Judah. Zephaniah was the son of Cushi, son of Gedaliah, son of Amariah, son of Hezekiah.
36Zph 1:2 °∞I will sweep away everything from the face of the earth,°± says the Lord.
36Zph 1:3 °∞I will sweep away people and animals alike. I will sweep away the birds of the sky and the fish in the sea. I will reduce the wicked to heaps of rubble®Á, and I will wipe humanity from the face of the earth,°± says the Lord. / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
36Zph 1:4 °∞I will crush Judah and Jerusalem with my fist and destroy every last trace of their Baal worship. I will put an end to all the idolatrous priests, so that even the memory of them will disappear.
36Zph 1:5 For they go up to their roofs and bow down to the sun, moon, and stars. They claim to follow the Lord, but then they worship Molech®Á, too. / ®ÁHebrew Malcam, a variant spelling of Molech; or it could possibly mean their king.
36Zph 1:6 And I will destroy those who used to worship me but now no longer do. They no longer ask for the Lord°Øs guidance or seek my blessings.°±
36Zph 1:7 Stand in silence in the presence of the Sovereign Lord, for the awesome day of the Lord°Øs judgment is near. The Lord has prepared his people for a great slaughter and has chosen their executioners®Á. / ®ÁHebrew has prepared a sacrifice and sanctified his guests.
36Zph 1:8 °∞On that day of judgment,°± says the Lord, °∞I will punish the leaders and princes of Judah and all those following pagan customs.
36Zph 1:9 Yes, I will punish those who participate in pagan worship ceremonies, and those who fill their masters°Ø houses with violence and deceit.
36Zph 1:10 °∞On that day,°± says the Lord, °∞a cry of alarm will come from the Fish Gate and echo throughout the New Quarter of the city®Á. And a great crash will sound from the hills. / ®ÁOr the Second Quarter, a newer section of Jerusalem. Hebrew reads the Mishneh.
36Zph 1:11 Wail in sorrow, all you who live in the market area, for all the merchants and traders will be destroyed.
36Zph 1:12 °∞I will search with lanterns in Jerusalem°Øs darkest corners to punish those who sit complacent in their sins. They think the Lord will do nothing to them, either good or bad.
36Zph 1:13 So their property will be plundered, their homes will be ransacked. They will build new homes but never live in them. They will plant vineyards but never drink wine from them.
36Zph 1:14 °∞That terrible day of the Lord is near. Swiftly it comes - a day of bitter tears, a day when even strong men will cry out.
36Zph 1:15 It will be a day when the Lord°Øs anger is poured out - a day of terrible distress and anguish, a day of ruin and desolation, a day of darkness and gloom, a day of clouds and blackness,
36Zph 1:16 a day of trumpet calls and battle cries. Down go the walled cities and the strongest battlements!
36Zph 1:17 °∞Because you have sinned against the Lord, I will make you grope around like the blind. Your blood will be poured into the dust, and your bodies will lie rotting on the ground.°±
36Zph 1:18 Your silver and gold will not save you on that day of the Lord°Øs anger. For the whole land will be devoured by the fire of his jealousy. He will make a terrifying end of all the people on earth®Á. / ®ÁOr the people living in the land.
36Zph 2:1 Gather together - yes, gather together, you shameless nation.
36Zph 2:2 Gather before judgment begins, before your time to repent is blown away like chaff. Act now, before the fierce fury of the Lord falls and the terrible day of the Lord°Øs anger begins.
36Zph 2:3 Seek the Lord, all who are humble, and follow his commands. Seek to do what is right and to live humbly. Perhaps even yet the Lord will protect you - protect you from his anger on that day of destruction.
36Zph 2:4 Gaza and Ashkelon will be abandoned, Ashdod and Ekron torn down.
36Zph 2:5 And what sorrow awaits you Philistines®Á who live along the coast and in the land of Canaan, for this judgment is against you, too! The Lord will destroy you until not one of you is left. / ®ÁHebrew Kerethites.
36Zph 2:6 The Philistine coast will become a wilderness pasture, a place of shepherd camps and enclosures for sheep and goats.
36Zph 2:7 The remnant of the tribe of Judah will pasture there. They will rest at night in the abandoned houses in Ashkelon. For the Lord their God will visit his people in kindness and restore their prosperity again.
36Zph 2:8 °∞I have heard the taunts of the Moabites and the insults of the Ammonites, mocking my people and invading their borders.
36Zph 2:9 Now, as surely as I live,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, the God of Israel, °∞Moab and Ammon will be destroyed - destroyed as completely as Sodom and Gomorrah. Their land will become a place of stinging nettles, salt pits, and eternal desolation. The remnant of my people will plunder them and take their land.°±
36Zph 2:10 They will receive the wages of their pride, for they have scoffed at the people of the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.
36Zph 2:11 The Lord will terrify them as he destroys all the gods in the land. Then nations around the world will worship the Lord, each in their own land.
36Zph 2:12 °∞You Ethiopians®Á will also be slaughtered by my sword,°± says the Lord. / ®ÁHebrew Cushites.
36Zph 2:13 And the Lord will strike the lands of the north with his fist, destroying the land of Assyria. He will make its great capital, Nineveh, a desolate wasteland, parched like a desert.
36Zph 2:14 The proud city will become a pasture for flocks and herds, and all sorts of wild animals will settle there. The desert owl and screech owl will roost on its ruined columns, their calls echoing through the gaping windows. Rubble will block all the doorways, and the cedar paneling will be exposed to the weather.
36Zph 2:15 This is the boisterous city, once so secure. °∞I am the greatest!°± it boasted. °∞No other city can compare with me!°± But now, look how it has become an utter ruin, a haven for wild animals. Everyone passing by will laugh in derision and shake a defiant fist.
36Zph 3:1 What sorrow awaits rebellious, polluted Jerusalem, the city of violence and crime!
36Zph 3:2 No one can tell it anything; it refuses all correction. It does not trust in the Lord or draw near to its God.
36Zph 3:3 Its leaders are like roaring lions hunting for their victims. Its judges are like ravenous wolves at evening time, who by dawn have left no trace of their prey.
36Zph 3:4 Its prophets are arrogant liars seeking their own gain. Its priests defile the Temple by disobeying God°Øs instructions.
36Zph 3:5 But the Lord is still there in the city, and he does no wrong. Day by day he hands down justice, and he does not fail. But the wicked know no shame.
36Zph 3:6 °∞I have wiped out many nations, devastating their fortress walls and towers. Their streets are now deserted; their cities lie in silent ruin. There are no survivors - none at all.
36Zph 3:7 I thought, °ÆSurely they will have reverence for me now! Surely they will listen to my warnings. Then I won°Øt need to strike again, destroying their homes.°Ø But no, they get up early to continue their evil deeds.
36Zph 3:8 Therefore, be patient,°± says the Lord. °∞Soon I will stand and accuse these evil nations. For I have decided to gather the kingdoms of the earth and pour out my fiercest anger and fury on them. All the earth will be devoured by the fire of my jealousy.
36Zph 3:9 °∞Then I will purify the speech of all people, so that everyone can worship the Lord together.
36Zph 3:10 My scattered people who live beyond the rivers of Ethiopia®Á will come to present their offerings. / ®ÁHebrew Cush.
36Zph 3:11 On that day you will no longer need to be ashamed, for you will no longer be rebels against me. I will remove all proud and arrogant people from among you. There will be no more haughtiness on my holy mountain.
36Zph 3:12 Those who are left will be the lowly and humble, for it is they who trust in the name of the Lord.
36Zph 3:13 The remnant of Israel will do no wrong; they will never tell lies or deceive one another. They will eat and sleep in safety, and no one will make them afraid.°±

37Hg 1:1 On August 29®Á of the second year of King Darius°Øs reign, the Lord gave a message through the prophet Haggai to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Jeshua®Ë son of Jehozadak, the high priest. / ®ÁHebrew On the first day of the sixth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. A number of dates in Haggai can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Persian records and related accurately to our modern calendar. This event occurred on August 29, 520 b.c. ®ËHebrew Joshua, a variant spelling of Jeshua; also in 1.12, 14.
37Hg 1:2 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ The people are saying, °ÆThe time has not yet come to rebuild the house of the Lord.°Ø°±
37Hg 1:3 Then the Lord sent this message through the prophet Haggai£∫ 
37Hg 1:4 °∞Why are you living in luxurious houses while my house lies in ruins? 
37Hg 1:5 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ Look at what°Øs happening to you! 
37Hg 1:6 You have planted much but harvest little. You eat but are not satisfied. You drink but are still thirsty. You put on clothes but cannot keep warm. Your wages disappear as though you were putting them in pockets filled with holes!
37Hg 1:7 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ Look at what°Øs happening to you! 
37Hg 1:8 Now go up into the hills, bring down timber, and rebuild my house. Then I will take pleasure in it and be honored, says the Lord. 
37Hg 1:9 You hoped for rich harvests, but they were poor. And when you brought your harvest home, I blew it away. Why? Because my house lies in ruins, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, while all of you are busy building your own fine houses. 
37Hg 1:10 It°Øs because of you that the heavens withhold the dew and the earth produces no crops. 
37Hg 1:11 I have called for a drought on your fields and hills - a drought to wither the grain and grapes and olive trees and all your other crops, a drought to starve you and your livestock and to ruin everything you have worked so hard to get.°±
37Hg 1:12 Then Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the whole remnant of God°Øs people began to obey the message from the Lord their God. When they heard the words of the prophet Haggai, whom the Lord their God had sent, the people feared the Lord. 
37Hg 1:13 Then Haggai, the Lord°Øs messenger, gave the people this message from the Lord£∫ °∞I am with you, says the Lord!°±
37Hg 1:14 So the Lord sparked the enthusiasm of Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the enthusiasm of Jeshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and the enthusiasm of the whole remnant of God°Øs people. They began to work on the house of their God, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, 
37Hg 1:15 on September 21®Á of the second year of King Darius°Øs reign. / ®ÁHebrew on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This event occurred on September 21, 520 b.c.; also see note on 1.1a.
37Hg 2:1 Then on October 17 of that same year®Á, the Lord sent another message through the prophet Haggai. / ®ÁHebrew on the twenty-first day of the seventh month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This event (in the second year of Darius°Øs reign) occurred on October 17, 520 b.c.; also see note on 1.1a.
37Hg 2:2 °∞Say this to Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and to Jeshua®Á son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and to the remnant of God°Øs people there in the land£∫ / ®ÁHebrew Joshua, a variant spelling of Jeshua; also in 2.4.
37Hg 2:3 °ÆDoes anyone remember this house - this Temple - in its former splendor? How, in comparison, does it look to you now? It must seem like nothing at all! 
37Hg 2:4 But now the Lord says£∫ Be strong, Zerubbabel. Be strong, Jeshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest. Be strong, all you people still left in the land. And now get to work, for I am with you, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. 
37Hg 2:5 My Spirit remains among you, just as I promised when you came out of Egypt. So do not be afraid.°Ø
37Hg 2:6 °∞For this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ In just a little while I will again shake the heavens and the earth, the oceans and the dry land. 
37Hg 2:7 I will shake all the nations, and the treasures of all the nations will be brought to this Temple. I will fill this place with glory, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. 
37Hg 2:8 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. 
37Hg 2:9 The future glory of this Temple will be greater than its past glory, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. And in this place I will bring peace. I, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, have spoken!°±
37Hg 2:10 On December 18®Á of the second year of King Darius°Øs reign, the Lord sent this message to the prophet Haggai£∫ / ®ÁHebrew On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar (similarly in 2.18). This event occurred on December 18, 520 b.c.; also see note on 1.1a.
37Hg 2:11 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says. Ask the priests this question about the law£∫ 
37Hg 2:12 °ÆIf one of you is carrying some meat from a holy sacrifice in his robes and his robe happens to brush against some bread or stew, wine or olive oil, or any other kind of food, will it also become holy?°Ø°± The priests replied, °∞No.°±
37Hg 2:13 Then Haggai asked, °∞If someone becomes ceremonially unclean by touching a dead person and then touches any of these foods, will the food be defiled?°± And the priests answered, °∞Yes.°±
37Hg 2:14 Then Haggai responded, °∞That is how it is with this people and this nation, says the Lord. Everything they do and everything they offer is defiled by their sin. 
37Hg 2:15 Look at what was happening to you before you began to lay the foundation of the Lord°Øs Temple. 
37Hg 2:16 When you hoped for a twenty-bushel crop, you harvested only ten. When you expected to draw fifty gallons from the winepress, you found only twenty. 
37Hg 2:17 I sent blight and mildew and hail to destroy everything you worked so hard to produce. Even so, you refused to return to me, says the Lord.
37Hg 2:18 °∞Think about this eighteenth day of December, the day®Á when the foundation of the Lord°Øs Temple was laid. Think carefully. / ®ÁOr On this eighteenth day of December, think about the day.
37Hg 2:19 I am giving you a promise now while the seed is still in the barn®Á. You have not yet harvested your grain, and your grapevines, fig trees, pomegranates, and olive trees have not yet produced their crops. But from this day onward I will bless you.°± / ®ÁHebrew Is the seed yet in the barn?
37Hg 2:20 On that same day, December 18®Á, the Lord sent this second message to Haggai£∫ / ®ÁHebrew On the twenty-fourth day of the [ninth] month; see note on 2.10.
37Hg 2:21 °∞Tell Zerubbabel, the governor of Judah, that I am about to shake the heavens and the earth. 
37Hg 2:22 I will overthrow royal thrones and destroy the power of foreign kingdoms. I will overturn their chariots and riders. The horses will fall, and their riders will kill each other.
37Hg 2:23 °∞But when this happens, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, I will honor you, Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, my servant. I will make you like a signet ring on my finger, says the Lord, for I have chosen you. I, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, have spoken!°±

38Zch 1:1 In November®Á of the second year of King Darius°Øs reign, the Lord gave this message to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah and grandson of Iddo. / ®ÁHebrew In the eighth month. A number of dates in Zechariah can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Persian records and related accurately to our modern calendar. This month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred within the months of October and November 520 b.c.
38Zch 1:2 °∞I, the Lord, was very angry with your ancestors. 
38Zch 1:3 Therefore, say to the people, °ÆThis is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ Return to me, and I will return to you, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.°Ø 
38Zch 1:4 Don°Øt be like your ancestors who would not listen or pay attention when the earlier prophets said to them, °ÆThis is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ Turn from your evil ways, and stop all your evil practices.°Ø
38Zch 1:5 °∞Where are your ancestors now? They and the prophets are long dead. 
38Zch 1:6 But everything I said through my servants the prophets happened to your ancestors, just as I said. As a result, they repented and said, °ÆWe have received what we deserved from the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. He has done what he said he would do.°Ø°±
38Zch 1:7 Three months later, on February 15®Á, the Lord sent another message to the prophet Zechariah son of Berekiah and grandson of Iddo. / ®ÁHebrew On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius. This event occurred on February 15, 519 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.
38Zch 1:8 In a vision during the night, I saw a man sitting on a red horse that was standing among some myrtle trees in a small valley. Behind him were riders on red, brown, and white horses. 
38Zch 1:9 I asked the angel who was talking with me, °∞My lord, what do these horses mean?°± °∞I will show you,°± the angel replied.
38Zch 1:10 The rider standing among the myrtle trees then explained, °∞They are the ones the Lord has sent out to patrol the earth.°±
38Zch 1:11 Then the other riders reported to the angel of the Lord, who was standing among the myrtle trees, °∞We have been patrolling the earth, and the whole earth is at peace.°±
38Zch 1:12 Upon hearing this, the angel of the Lord prayed this prayer£∫ °∞O Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, for seventy years now you have been angry with Jerusalem and the towns of Judah. How long until you again show mercy to them?°± 
38Zch 1:13 And the Lord spoke kind and comforting words to the angel who talked with me.
38Zch 1:14 Then the angel said to me, °∞Shout this message for all to hear£∫ °ÆThis is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ My love for Jerusalem and Mount Zion is passionate and strong. 
38Zch 1:15 But I am very angry with the other nations that are now enjoying peace and security. I was only a little angry with my people, but the nations inflicted harm on them far beyond my intentions.
38Zch 1:16 °∞°ÆTherefore, this is what the Lord says£∫ I have returned to show mercy to Jerusalem. My Temple will be rebuilt, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, and measurements will be taken for the reconstruction of Jerusalem®Á.°Ø / ®ÁHebrew and the measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem.
38Zch 1:17 °∞Say this also£∫ °ÆThis is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ The towns of Israel will again overflow with prosperity, and the Lord will again comfort Zion and choose Jerusalem as his own.°Ø°±
38Zch 1:18 ®ÁThen I looked up and saw four animal horns. / ®ÁVerses 1.18-21 are numbered 2.1-4 in Hebrew text.
38Zch 1:19 °∞What are these?°± I asked the angel who was talking with me. He replied, °∞These horns represent the nations that scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.°±
38Zch 1:20 Then the Lord showed me four blacksmiths. 
38Zch 1:21 °∞What are these men coming to do?°± I asked. The angel replied, °∞These four horns - these nations - scattered and humbled Judah. Now these blacksmiths have come to terrify those nations and throw them down and destroy them.°±
38Zch 2:1 ®ÁWhen I looked again, I saw a man with a measuring line in his hand. / ®ÁVerses 2.1-13 are numbered 2.5-17 in Hebrew text.
38Zch 2:2 °∞Where are you going?°± I asked. He replied, °∞I am going to measure Jerusalem, to see how wide and how long it is.°±
38Zch 2:3 Then the angel who was with me went to meet a second angel who was coming toward him. 
38Zch 2:4 The other angel said, °∞Hurry, and say to that young man, °ÆJerusalem will someday be so full of people and livestock that there won°Øt be room enough for everyone! Many will live outside the city walls. 
38Zch 2:5 Then I, myself, will be a protective wall of fire around Jerusalem, says the Lord. And I will be the glory inside the city!°Ø°±
38Zch 2:6 The Lord says, °∞Come away! Flee from Babylon in the land of the north, for I have scattered you to the four winds. 
38Zch 2:7 Come away, people of Zion, you who are exiled in Babylon!°±
38Zch 2:8 After a period of glory, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies sent me®Á against the nations who plundered you. For he said, °∞Anyone who harms you harms my most precious possession®Ë. / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. ®ËHebrew Anyone who touches you touches the pupil of his eye.
38Zch 2:9 I will raise my fist to crush them, and their own slaves will plunder them.°± Then you will know that the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has sent me.
38Zch 2:10 The Lord says, °∞Shout and rejoice, O beautiful Jerusalem®Á, for I am coming to live among you. / ®ÁHebrew O daughter of Zion.
38Zch 2:11 Many nations will join themselves to the Lord on that day, and they, too, will be my people. I will live among you, and you will know that the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies sent me to you. 
38Zch 2:12 The land of Judah will be the Lord°Øs special possession in the holy land, and he will once again choose Jerusalem to be his own city. 
38Zch 2:13 Be silent before the Lord, all humanity, for he is springing into action from his holy dwelling.°±
38Zch 3:1 Then the angel showed me Jeshua®Á the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord. The Accuser, Satan®Ë, was there at the angel°Øs right hand, making accusations against Jeshua. / ®ÁHebrew Joshua, a variant spelling of Jeshua; also in 3.3, 4, 6, 8, 9. ®ËHebrew The satan; similarly in 3.2.
38Zch 3:2 And the Lord said to Satan, °∞I, the Lord, reject your accusations, Satan. Yes, the Lord, who has chosen Jerusalem, rebukes you. This man is like a burning stick that has been snatched from the fire.°±
38Zch 3:3 Jeshua°Øs clothing was filthy as he stood there before the angel. 
38Zch 3:4 So the angel said to the others standing there, °∞Take off his filthy clothes.°± And turning to Jeshua he said, °∞See, I have taken away your sins, and now I am giving you these fine new clothes.°±
38Zch 3:5 Then I said, °∞They should also place a clean turban on his head.°± So they put a clean priestly turban on his head and dressed him in new clothes while the angel of the Lord stood by.
38Zch 3:6 Then the angel of the Lord spoke very solemnly to Jeshua and said, 
38Zch 3:7 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ If you follow my ways and carefully serve me, then you will be given authority over my Temple and its courtyards. I will let you walk among these others standing here.
38Zch 3:8 °∞Listen to me, O Jeshua the high priest, and all you other priests. You are symbols of things to come. Soon I am going to bring my servant, the Branch. 
38Zch 3:9 Now look at the jewel I have set before Jeshua, a single stone with seven facets®Á. I will engrave an inscription on it, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, and I will remove the sins of this land in a single day. / ®ÁHebrew seven eyes.
38Zch 3:10 °∞And on that day, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, each of you will invite your neighbor to sit with you peacefully under your own grapevine and fig tree.°±
38Zch 4:1 Then the angel who had been talking with me returned and woke me, as though I had been asleep. 
38Zch 4:2 °∞What do you see now?°± he asked. I answered, °∞I see a solid gold lampstand with a bowl of oil on top of it. Around the bowl are seven lamps, each having seven spouts with wicks. 
38Zch 4:3 And I see two olive trees, one on each side of the bowl.°± 
38Zch 4:4 Then I asked the angel, °∞What are these, my lord? What do they mean?°±
38Zch 4:5 °∞Don°Øt you know?°± the angel asked. °∞No, my lord,°± I replied.
38Zch 4:6 Then he said to me, °∞This is what the Lord says to Zerubbabel£∫ It is not by force nor by strength, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. 
38Zch 4:7 Nothing, not even a mighty mountain, will stand in Zerubbabel°Øs way; it will become a level plain before him! And when Zerubbabel sets the final stone of the Temple in place, the people will shout£∫ °ÆMay God bless it! May God bless it!°Ø®Á°± / ®ÁHebrew °ÆGrace, grace to it.°Ø
38Zch 4:8 Then another message came to me from the Lord£∫ 
38Zch 4:9 °∞Zerubbabel is the one who laid the foundation of this Temple, and he will complete it. Then you will know that the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has sent me. 
38Zch 4:10 Do not despise these small beginnings, for the Lord rejoices to see the work begin, to see the plumb line in Zerubbabel°Øs hand.°± (The seven lamps®Á represent the eyes of the Lord that search all around the world.) / ®ÁOr The seven facets (see 3.9); Hebrew reads These seven.
38Zch 4:11 Then I asked the angel, °∞What are these two olive trees on each side of the lampstand, 
38Zch 4:12 and what are the two olive branches that pour out golden oil through two gold tubes?°±
38Zch 4:13 °∞Don°Øt you know?°± he asked. °∞No, my lord,°± I replied.
38Zch 4:14 Then he said to me, °∞They represent the two heavenly beings who stand in the court of the Lord of all the earth.°±
38Zch 5:1 I looked up again and saw a scroll flying through the air.
38Zch 5:2 °∞What do you see?°± the angel asked. °∞I see a flying scroll,°± I replied. °∞It appears to be about 30 feet long and 15 feet wide®Á.°± / ®ÁHebrew 20 cubits [9 meters] long and 10 cubits [4.5 meters] wide.
38Zch 5:3 Then he said to me, °∞This scroll contains the curse that is going out over the entire land. One side of the scroll says that those who steal will be banished from the land; the other side says that those who swear falsely will be banished from the land. 
38Zch 5:4 And this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ I am sending this curse into the house of every thief and into the house of everyone who swears falsely using my name. And my curse will remain in that house and completely destroy it - even its timbers and stones.°±
38Zch 5:5 Then the angel who was talking with me came forward and said, °∞Look up and see what°Øs coming.°±
38Zch 5:6 °∞What is it?°± I asked. He replied, °∞It is a basket for measuring grain®Á, and it°Øs filled with the sins®Ë of everyone throughout the land.°± / ®ÁHebrew an ephah [20 quarts or 22 liters]; also in 5.7, 8, 9, 10, 11. ®ËAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads the appearance.
38Zch 5:7 Then the heavy lead cover was lifted off the basket, and there was a woman sitting inside it. 
38Zch 5:8 The angel said, °∞The woman°Øs name is Wickedness,°± and he pushed her back into the basket and closed the heavy lid again.
38Zch 5:9 Then I looked up and saw two women flying toward us, gliding on the wind. They had wings like a stork, and they picked up the basket and flew into the sky.
38Zch 5:10 °∞Where are they taking the basket?°± I asked the angel.
38Zch 5:11 He replied, °∞To the land of Babylonia®Á, where they will build a temple for the basket. And when the temple is ready, they will set the basket there on its pedestal.°± / ®ÁHebrew the land of Shinar.
38Zch 6:1 Then I looked up again and saw four chariots coming from between two bronze mountains. 
38Zch 6:2 The first chariot was pulled by red horses, the second by black horses, 
38Zch 6:3 the third by white horses, and the fourth by powerful dappled-gray horses. 
38Zch 6:4 °∞And what are these, my lord?°± I asked the angel who was talking with me.
38Zch 6:5 The angel replied, °∞These are the four spirits®Á of heaven who stand before the Lord of all the earth. They are going out to do his work. / ®ÁOr the four winds.
38Zch 6:6 The chariot with black horses is going north, the chariot with white horses is going west®Á, and the chariot with dappled-gray horses is going south.°± / ®ÁHebrew is going after them.
38Zch 6:7 The powerful horses were eager to set out to patrol the earth. And the Lord said, °∞Go and patrol the earth!°± So they left at once on their patrol.
38Zch 6:8 Then the Lord summoned me and said, °∞Look, those who went north have vented the anger of my Spirit®Á there in the land of the north.°± / ®ÁHebrew have given my Spirit rest.
38Zch 6:9 Then I received another message from the Lord£∫ 
38Zch 6:10 °∞Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah will bring gifts of silver and gold from the Jews exiled in Babylon. As soon as they arrive, meet them at the home of Josiah son of Zephaniah.

38Zch 6:15 People will come from distant lands to rebuild the Temple of the Lord. And when this happens, you will know that my messages have been from the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. All this will happen if you carefully obey what the Lord your God says.
38Zch 7:1 On December 7®Á of the fourth year of King Darius°Øs reign, another message came to Zechariah from the Lord. / ®ÁHebrew On the fourth day of the ninth month, the month of Kislev, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This event occurred on December 7, 518 b.c.; also see note on 1.1.

38Zch 7:4 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies sent me this message in reply£∫ 
38Zch 7:5 °∞Say to all your people and your priests, °ÆDuring these seventy years of exile, when you fasted and mourned in the summer and in early autumn®Á, was it really for me that you were fasting? / ®ÁHebrew fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh months. The fifth month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of July and August. The seventh month usually occurs within the months of September and October; both the Day of Atonement and the Festival of Shelters were celebrated in the seventh month.
38Zch 7:6 And even now in your holy festivals, aren°Øt you eating and drinking just to please yourselves? 
38Zch 7:7 Isn°Øt this the same message the Lord proclaimed through the prophets in years past when Jerusalem and the towns of Judah were bustling with people, and the Negev and the foothills of Judah®Á were well populated?°Ø°± / ®ÁHebrew the Shephelah.
38Zch 7:8 Then this message came to Zechariah from the Lord£∫

38Zch 7:10 Do not oppress widows, orphans, foreigners, and the poor. And do not scheme against each other.
38Zch 7:11 °∞Your ancestors refused to listen to this message. They stubbornly turned away and put their fingers in their ears to keep from hearing. 
38Zch 7:12 They made their hearts as hard as stone, so they could not hear the instructions or the messages that the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies had sent them by his Spirit through the earlier prophets. That is why the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies was so angry with them.
38Zch 7:13 °∞Since they refused to listen when I called to them, I would not listen when they called to me, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. 
38Zch 7:14 As with a whirlwind, I scattered them among the distant nations, where they lived as strangers. Their land became so desolate that no one even traveled through it. They turned their pleasant land into a desert.°±

38Zch 8:3 °∞And now the Lord says£∫ I am returning to Mount Zion, and I will live in Jerusalem. Then Jerusalem will be called the Faithful City; the mountain of the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies will be called the Holy Mountain.
38Zch 8:4 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ Once again old men and women will walk Jerusalem°Øs streets with their canes and will sit together in the city squares. 
38Zch 8:5 And the streets of the city will be filled with boys and girls at play.
38Zch 8:6 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ All this may seem impossible to you now, a small remnant of God°Øs people. But is it impossible for me? says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.
38Zch 8:7 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ You can be sure that I will rescue my people from the east and from the west. 
38Zch 8:8 I will bring them home again to live safely in Jerusalem. They will be my people, and I will be faithful and just toward them as their God.
38Zch 8:9 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ Be strong and finish the task! Ever since the laying of the foundation of the Temple of the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, you have heard what the prophets have been saying about completing the building. 
38Zch 8:10 Before the work on the Temple began, there were no jobs and no money to hire people or animals. No traveler was safe from the enemy, for there were enemies on all sides. I had turned everyone against each other.
38Zch 8:11 °∞But now I will not treat the remnant of my people as I treated them before, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. 
38Zch 8:12 For I am planting seeds of peace and prosperity among you. The grapevines will be heavy with fruit. The earth will produce its crops, and the heavens will release the dew. Once more I will cause the remnant in Judah and Israel to inherit these blessings. 
38Zch 8:13 Among the other nations, Judah and Israel became symbols of a cursed nation. But no longer! Now I will rescue you and make you both a symbol and a source of blessing. So don°Øt be afraid. Be strong, and get on with rebuilding the Temple!
38Zch 8:14 °∞For this is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ I was determined to punish you when your ancestors angered me, and I did not change my mind, says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. 
38Zch 8:15 But now I am determined to bless Jerusalem and the people of Judah. So don°Øt be afraid. 
38Zch 8:16 But this is what you must do£∫ Tell the truth to each other. Render verdicts in your courts that are just and that lead to peace. 
38Zch 8:17 Don°Øt scheme against each other. Stop your love of telling lies that you swear are the truth. I hate all these things, says the Lord.°±
38Zch 8:18 Here is another message that came to me from the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. 
38Zch 8:19 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ The traditional fasts and times of mourning you have kept in early summer, midsummer, autumn, and winter®Á are now ended. They will become festivals of joy and celebration for the people of Judah. So love truth and peace. / ®ÁHebrew in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months. The fourth month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of June and July. The fifth month usually occurs within the months of July and August. The seventh month usually occurs within the months of September and October. The tenth month usually occurs within the months of December and January.
38Zch 8:20 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ People from nations and cities around the world will travel to Jerusalem. 
38Zch 8:21 The people of one city will say to the people of another, °ÆCome with us to Jerusalem to ask the Lord to bless us. Let°Øs worship the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. I°Øm determined to go.°Ø 
38Zch 8:22 Many peoples and powerful nations will come to Jerusalem to seek the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies and to ask for his blessing.
38Zch 8:23 °∞This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says£∫ In those days ten men from different nations and languages of the world will clutch at the sleeve of one Jew. And they will say, °ÆPlease let us walk with you, for we have heard that God is with you.°Ø°±
38Zch 9:1 This is the message®Á from the Lord against the land of Aram®Ë and the city of Damascus, for the eyes of humanity, including all the tribes of Israel, are on the Lord. / ®ÁHebrew An Oracle£∫ The message. ®ËHebrew land of Hadrach.
38Zch 9:2 Doom is certain for Hamath, near Damascus, and for the cities of Tyre and Sidon, though they are so clever.
38Zch 9:3 Tyre has built a strong fortress and has made silver and gold as plentiful as dust in the streets!
38Zch 9:4 But now the Lord will strip away Tyre°Øs possessions and hurl its fortifications into the sea, and it will be burned to the ground.
38Zch 9:5 The city of Ashkelon will see Tyre fall and will be filled with fear. Gaza will shake with terror, as will Ekron, for their hopes will be dashed. Gaza°Øs king will be killed, and Ashkelon will be deserted.
38Zch 9:6 Foreigners will occupy the city of Ashdod. I will destroy the pride of the Philistines.
38Zch 9:7 I will grab the bloody meat from their mouths and snatch the detestable sacrifices from their teeth. Then the surviving Philistines will worship our God and become like a clan in Judah®Á. The Philistines of Ekron will join my people, as the ancient Jebusites once did. / ®ÁHebrew and will become a leader in Judah.
38Zch 9:8 I will guard my Temple and protect it from invading armies. I am watching closely to ensure that no more foreign oppressors overrun my people°Øs land.
38Zch 9:9 Rejoice, O people of Zion!®Á Shout in triumph, O people of Jerusalem! Look, your king is coming to you. He is righteous and victorious®Ë, yet he is humble, riding on a donkey - riding on a donkey°Øs colt. / ®ÁHebrew O daughter of Zion! ®ËHebrew and is being vindicated.
38Zch 9:10 I will remove the battle chariots from Israel®Á and the warhorses from Jerusalem. I will destroy all the weapons used in battle, and your king will bring peace to the nations. His realm will stretch from sea to sea and from the Euphrates River®Ë to the ends of the earth®È. / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel; also in 9.13. ®ËHebrew the river. ®ÈOr the end of the land.
38Zch 9:11 Because of the covenant I made with you, sealed with blood, I will free your prisoners from death in a waterless dungeon.
38Zch 9:12 Come back to the place of safety, all you prisoners who still have hope! I promise this very day that I will repay two blessings for each of your troubles.
38Zch 9:13 Judah is my bow, and Israel is my arrow. Jerusalem®Á is my sword, and like a warrior, I will brandish it against the Greeks®Ë. / ®ÁHebrew Zion. ®ËHebrew the sons of Javan.
38Zch 9:14 The Lord will appear above his people; his arrows will fly like lightning! The Sovereign Lord will sound the ram°Øs horn and attack like a whirlwind from the southern desert.
38Zch 9:15 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies will protect his people, and they will defeat their enemies by hurling great stones. They will shout in battle as though drunk with wine. They will be filled with blood like a bowl, drenched with blood like the corners of the altar.
38Zch 9:16 On that day the Lord their God will rescue his people, just as a shepherd rescues his sheep. They will sparkle in his land like jewels in a crown.
38Zch 9:17 How wonderful and beautiful they will be! The young men will thrive on abundant grain, and the young women will flourish on new wine.
38Zch 10:1 Ask the Lord for rain in the spring, for he makes the storm clouds. And he will send showers of rain so every field becomes a lush pasture.
38Zch 10:2 Household gods give worthless advice, fortune-tellers predict only lies, and interpreters of dreams pronounce falsehoods that give no comfort. So my people are wandering like lost sheep; they are attacked because they have no shepherd.
38Zch 10:3 °∞My anger burns against your shepherds, and I will punish these leaders®Á. For the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has arrived to look after Judah, his flock. He will make them strong and glorious, like a proud warhorse in battle. / ®ÁOr these male goats.
38Zch 10:4 From Judah will come the cornerstone, the tent peg, the bow for battle, and all the rulers.
38Zch 10:5 They will be like mighty warriors in battle, trampling their enemies in the mud under their feet. Since the Lord is with them as they fight, they will overthrow even the enemy°Øs horsemen.
38Zch 10:6 °∞I will strengthen Judah and save Israel®Á; I will restore them because of my compassion. It will be as though I had never rejected them, for I am the Lord their God, who will hear their cries. / ®ÁHebrew save the house of Joseph.
38Zch 10:7 The people of Israel®Á will become like mighty warriors, and their hearts will be made happy as if by wine. Their children, too, will see it and be glad; their hearts will rejoice in the Lord. / ®ÁHebrew of Ephraim.
38Zch 10:8 When I whistle to them, they will come running, for I have redeemed them. From the few who are left, they will grow as numerous as they were before.
38Zch 10:9 Though I have scattered them like seeds among the nations, they will still remember me in distant lands. They and their children will survive and return again to Israel.
38Zch 10:10 I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from Assyria. I will resettle them in Gilead and Lebanon until there is no more room for them all.
38Zch 10:11 They will pass safely through the sea of distress®Á, for the waves of the sea will be held back, and the waters of the Nile will dry up. The pride of Assyria will be crushed, and the rule of Egypt will end. / ®ÁOr the sea of Egypt, referring to the Red Sea.
38Zch 10:12 By my power®Á I will make my people strong, and by my authority they will go wherever they wish. I, the Lord, have spoken!°± / ®ÁHebrew In the Lord.
38Zch 11:1 Open your doors, Lebanon, so that fire may devour your cedar forests.
38Zch 11:2 Weep, you cypress trees, for all the ruined cedars; the most majestic ones have fallen. Weep, you oaks of Bashan, for the thick forests have been cut down.
38Zch 11:3 Listen to the wailing of the shepherds, for their rich pastures are destroyed. Hear the young lions roaring, for their thickets in the Jordan Valley are ruined.
38Zch 11:4 This is what the Lord my God says£∫ °∞Go and care for the flock that is intended for slaughter. 
38Zch 11:5 The buyers slaughter their sheep without remorse. The sellers say, °ÆPraise the Lord! Now I°Øm rich!°Ø Even the shepherds have no compassion for them. 
38Zch 11:6 Likewise, I will no longer have pity on the people of the land,°± says the Lord. °∞I will let them fall into each other°Øs hands and into the hands of their king. They will turn the land into a wilderness, and I will not rescue them.°±
38Zch 11:7 So I cared for the flock intended for slaughter - the flock that was oppressed. Then I took two shepherd°Øs staffs and named one Favor and the other Union. 
38Zch 11:8 I got rid of their three evil shepherds in a single month. But I became impatient with these sheep, and they hated me, too. 
38Zch 11:9 So I told them, °∞I won°Øt be your shepherd any longer. If you die, you die. If you are killed, you are killed. And let those who remain devour each other!°±
38Zch 11:10 Then I took my staff called Favor and cut it in two, showing that I had revoked the covenant I had made with all the nations. 
38Zch 11:11 That was the end of my covenant with them. The suffering flock was watching me, and they knew that the Lord was speaking through my actions.
38Zch 11:12 And I said to them, °∞If you like, give me my wages, whatever I am worth; but only if you want to.°± So they counted out for my wages thirty pieces of silver.
38Zch 11:13 And the Lord said to me, °∞Throw it to the potter®Á°± - this magnificent sum at which they valued me! So I took the thirty coins and threw them to the potter in the Temple of the Lord. / ®ÁSyriac version reads into the treasury; also in 11.13b. Compare Matt 27.6-10.
38Zch 11:14 Then I took my other staff, Union, and cut it in two, showing that the bond of unity between Judah and Israel was broken.
38Zch 11:15 Then the Lord said to me, °∞Go again and play the part of a worthless shepherd. 
38Zch 11:16 This illustrates how I will give this nation a shepherd who will not care for those who are dying, nor look after the young®Á, nor heal the injured, nor feed the healthy. Instead, this shepherd will eat the meat of the fattest sheep and tear off their hooves. / ®ÁOr the scattered.
38Zch 11:17 °∞What sorrow awaits this worthless shepherd who abandons the flock! The sword will cut his arm and pierce his right eye. His arm will become useless, and his right eye completely blind.°±
38Zch 12:1 This®Á message concerning the fate of Israel came from the Lord£∫ °∞This message is from the Lord, who stretched out the heavens, laid the foundations of the earth, and formed the human spirit. / ®ÁHebrew An Oracle£∫ This.
38Zch 12:2 I will make Jerusalem like an intoxicating drink that makes the nearby nations stagger when they send their armies to besiege Jerusalem and Judah. 
38Zch 12:3 On that day I will make Jerusalem an immovable rock. All the nations will gather against it to try to move it, but they will only hurt themselves.
38Zch 12:4 °∞On that day,°± says the Lord, °∞I will cause every horse to panic and every rider to lose his nerve. I will watch over the people of Judah, but I will blind all the horses of their enemies. 
38Zch 12:5 And the clans of Judah will say to themselves, °ÆThe people of Jerusalem have found strength in the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, their God.°Ø
38Zch 12:6 °∞On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a flame that sets a woodpile ablaze or like a burning torch among sheaves of grain. They will burn up all the neighboring nations right and left, while the people living in Jerusalem remain secure.
38Zch 12:7 °∞The Lord will give victory to the rest of Judah first, before Jerusalem, so that the people of Jerusalem and the royal line of David will not have greater honor than the rest of Judah. 
38Zch 12:8 On that day the Lord will defend the people of Jerusalem; the weakest among them will be as mighty as King David! And the royal descendants will be like God, like the angel of the Lord who goes before them! 
38Zch 12:9 For on that day I will begin to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.
38Zch 12:10 °∞Then I will pour out a spirit®Á of grace and prayer on the family of David and on the people of Jerusalem. They will look on me whom they have pierced and mourn for him as for an only son. They will grieve bitterly for him as for a firstborn son who has died. / ®ÁOr the Spirit.
38Zch 12:11 The sorrow and mourning in Jerusalem on that day will be like the great mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the valley of Megiddo.
38Zch 12:12 °∞All Israel will mourn, each clan by itself, and with the husbands separate from their wives. The clan of David will mourn alone, as will the clan of Nathan, 
38Zch 12:13 the clan of Levi, and the clan of Shimei. 
38Zch 12:14 Each of the surviving clans from Judah will mourn separately, and with the husbands separate from their wives.
38Zch 13:1 °∞On that day a fountain will be opened for the dynasty of David and for the people of Jerusalem, a fountain to cleanse them from all their sins and impurity.
38Zch 13:2 °∞And on that day,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, °∞I will erase idol worship throughout the land, so that even the names of the idols will be forgotten. I will remove from the land both the false prophets and the spirit of impurity that came with them. 
38Zch 13:3 If anyone continues to prophesy, his own father and mother will tell him, °ÆYou must die, for you have prophesied lies in the name of the Lord.°Ø And as he prophesies, his own father and mother will stab him.
38Zch 13:4 °∞On that day people will be ashamed to claim the prophetic gift. No one will pretend to be a prophet by wearing prophet°Øs clothes. 
38Zch 13:5 He will say, °ÆI°Øm no prophet; I°Øm a farmer. I began working for a farmer as a boy.°Ø 
38Zch 13:6 And if someone asks, °ÆThen what about those wounds on your chest?®Á°Ø he will say, °ÆI was wounded at my friends°Ø house!°Ø / ®ÁHebrew wounds between your hands?
38Zch 13:7 °∞Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, the man who is my partner,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. °∞Strike down the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn against the lambs.
38Zch 13:8 Two-thirds of the people in the land will be cut off and die,°± says the Lord. °∞But one-third will be left in the land.
38Zch 13:9 I will bring that group through the fire and make them pure. I will refine them like silver and purify them like gold. They will call on my name, and I will answer them. I will say, °ÆThese are my people,°Ø and they will say, °ÆThe Lord is our God.°Ø°±
38Zch 14:1 Watch, for the day of the Lord is coming when your possessions will be plundered right in front of you! 
38Zch 14:2 I will gather all the nations to fight against Jerusalem. The city will be taken, the houses looted, and the women raped. Half the population will be taken into captivity, and the rest will be left among the ruins of the city.
38Zch 14:3 Then the Lord will go out to fight against those nations, as he has fought in times past. 
38Zch 14:4 On that day his feet will stand on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem. And the Mount of Olives will split apart, making a wide valley running from east to west. Half the mountain will move toward the north and half toward the south. 
38Zch 14:5 You will flee through this valley, for it will reach across to Azal®Á. Yes, you will flee as you did from the earthquake in the days of King Uzziah of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come, and all his holy ones with him®Ë. / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. ®ËAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads with you.
38Zch 14:6 On that day the sources of light will no longer shine®Á, / ®ÁHebrew there will be no light, no cold or frost. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
38Zch 14:7 yet there will be continuous day! Only the Lord knows how this could happen. There will be no normal day and night, for at evening time it will still be light.
38Zch 14:8 On that day life-giving waters will flow out from Jerusalem, half toward the Dead Sea and half toward the Mediterranean®Á, flowing continuously in both summer and winter. / ®ÁHebrew half toward the eastern sea and half toward the western sea.
38Zch 14:9 And the Lord will be king over all the earth. On that day there will be one Lord - his name alone will be worshiped.
38Zch 14:10 All the land from Geba, north of Judah, to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem, will become one vast plain. But Jerusalem will be raised up in its original place and will be inhabited all the way from the Benjamin Gate over to the site of the old gate, then to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king°Øs winepresses. 
38Zch 14:11 And Jerusalem will be filled, safe at last, never again to be cursed and destroyed.
38Zch 14:12 And the Lord will send a plague on all the nations that fought against Jerusalem. Their people will become like walking corpses, their flesh rotting away. Their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. 
38Zch 14:13 On that day they will be terrified, stricken by the Lord with great panic. They will fight their neighbors hand to hand. 
38Zch 14:14 Judah, too, will be fighting at Jerusalem. The wealth of all the neighboring nations will be captured - great quantities of gold and silver and fine clothing. 
38Zch 14:15 This same plague will strike the horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all the other animals in the enemy camps.
38Zch 14:16 In the end, the enemies of Jerusalem who survive the plague will go up to Jerusalem each year to worship the King, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, and to celebrate the Festival of Shelters. 
38Zch 14:17 Any nation in the world that refuses to come to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, will have no rain. 
38Zch 14:18 If the people of Egypt refuse to attend the festival, the Lord will punish them with the same plague that he sends on the other nations who refuse to go. 
38Zch 14:19 Egypt and the other nations will all be punished if they don°Øt go to celebrate the Festival of Shelters.
38Zch 14:20 On that day even the harness bells of the horses will be inscribed with these words£∫ Holy to the Lord. And the cooking pots in the Temple of the Lord will be as sacred as the basins used beside the altar. 
38Zch 14:21 In fact, every cooking pot in Jerusalem and Judah will be holy to the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. All who come to worship will be free to use any of these pots to boil their sacrifices. And on that day there will no longer be traders®Á in the Temple of the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. / ®ÁHebrew Canaanites.

39Mal 1:1 This is the message®Á that the Lord gave to Israel through the prophet Malachi®Ë. / ®ÁHebrew An Oracle£∫ The message. ®ËMalachi means °∞my messenger.°±
39Mal 1:2 °∞I have always loved you,°± says the Lord. But you retort, °∞Really? How have you loved us?°± And the Lord replies, °∞This is how I showed my love for you£∫ I loved your ancestor Jacob, 
39Mal 1:3 but I rejected his brother, Esau, and devastated his hill country. I turned Esau°Øs inheritance into a desert for jackals.°±
39Mal 1:4 Esau°Øs descendants in Edom may say, °∞We have been shattered, but we will rebuild the ruins.°± But the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies replies, °∞They may try to rebuild, but I will demolish them again. Their country will be known as °ÆThe Land of Wickedness,°Ø and their people will be called °ÆThe People with Whom the Lord Is Forever Angry.°Ø 
39Mal 1:5 When you see the destruction for yourselves, you will say, °ÆTruly, the Lord°Øs greatness reaches far beyond Israel°Øs borders!°Ø°±
39Mal 1:6 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says to the priests£∫ °∞A son honors his father, and a servant respects his master. If I am your father and master, where are the honor and respect I deserve? You have shown contempt for my name! °∞But you ask, °ÆHow have we ever shown contempt for your name?°Ø
39Mal 1:7 °∞You have shown contempt by offering defiled sacrifices on my altar. °∞Then you ask, °ÆHow have we defiled the sacrifices?®Á°Ø °∞You defile them by saying the altar of the Lord deserves no respect. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads defiled you?
39Mal 1:8 When you give blind animals as sacrifices, isn°Øt that wrong? And isn°Øt it wrong to offer animals that are crippled and diseased? Try giving gifts like that to your governor, and see how pleased he is!°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.
39Mal 1:9 °∞Go ahead, beg God to be merciful to you! But when you bring that kind of offering, why should he show you any favor at all?°± asks the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.
39Mal 1:10 °∞How I wish one of you would shut the Temple doors so that these worthless sacrifices could not be offered! I am not pleased with you,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, °∞and I will not accept your offerings. 
39Mal 1:11 But my name is honored®Á by people of other nations from morning till night. All around the world they offer®Ë sweet incense and pure offerings in honor of my name. For my name is great among the nations,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. / ®ÁOr will be honored. ®ËOr will offer.
39Mal 1:12 °∞But you dishonor my name with your actions. By bringing contemptible food, you are saying it°Øs all right to defile the Lord°Øs table. 
39Mal 1:13 You say, °ÆIt°Øs too hard to serve the Lord,°Ø and you turn up your noses at my commands,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. °∞Think of it! Animals that are stolen and crippled and sick are being presented as offerings! Should I accept from you such offerings as these?°± asks the Lord.
39Mal 1:14 °∞Cursed is the cheat who promises to give a fine ram from his flock but then sacrifices a defective one to the Lord. For I am a great king,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, °∞and my name is feared among the nations!
39Mal 2:1 °∞Listen, you priests - this command is for you! 
39Mal 2:2 Listen to me and make up your minds to honor my name,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, °∞or I will bring a terrible curse against you. I will curse even the blessings you receive. Indeed, I have already cursed them, because you have not taken my warning to heart. 
39Mal 2:3 I will punish your descendants and splatter your faces with the manure from your festival sacrifices, and I will throw you on the manure pile. 
39Mal 2:4 Then at last you will know it was I who sent you this warning so that my covenant with the Levites can continue,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.
39Mal 2:5 °∞The purpose of my covenant with the Levites was to bring life and peace, and that is what I gave them. This required reverence from them, and they greatly revered me and stood in awe of my name. 
39Mal 2:6 They passed on to the people the truth of the instructions they received from me. They did not lie or cheat; they walked with me, living good and righteous lives, and they turned many from lives of sin.
39Mal 2:7 °∞The words of a priest°Øs lips should preserve knowledge of God, and people should go to him for instruction, for the priest is the messenger of the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. 
39Mal 2:8 But you priests have left God°Øs paths. Your instructions have caused many to stumble into sin. You have corrupted the covenant I made with the Levites,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. 
39Mal 2:9 °∞So I have made you despised and humiliated in the eyes of all the people. For you have not obeyed me but have shown favoritism in the way you carry out my instructions.°±
39Mal 2:10 Are we not all children of the same Father? Are we not all created by the same God? Then why do we betray each other, violating the covenant of our ancestors?
39Mal 2:11 Judah has been unfaithful, and a detestable thing has been done in Israel and in Jerusalem. The men of Judah have defiled the Lord°Øs beloved sanctuary by marrying women who worship idols. 
39Mal 2:12 May the Lord cut off from the nation of Israel®Á every last man who has done this and yet brings an offering to the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. / ®ÁHebrew from the tents of Jacob. The names °∞Jacob°± and °∞Israel°± are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation.
39Mal 2:13 Here is another thing you do. You cover the Lord°Øs altar with tears, weeping and groaning because he pays no attention to your offerings and doesn°Øt accept them with pleasure. 
39Mal 2:14 You cry out, °∞Why doesn°Øt the Lord accept my worship?°± I°Øll tell you why! Because the Lord witnessed the vows you and your wife made when you were young. But you have been unfaithful to her, though she remained your faithful partner, the wife of your marriage vows.
39Mal 2:15 Didn°Øt the Lord make you one with your wife? In body and spirit you are his®Á. And what does he want? Godly children from your union. So guard your heart; remain loyal to the wife of your youth. / ®ÁOr Didn°Øt the one Lord make us and preserve our life and breath? or Didn°Øt the one Lord make her, both flesh and spirit? The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain.
39Mal 2:16 °∞For I hate divorce!°± says the Lord, the God of Israel. °∞To divorce your wife is to overwhelm her with cruelty®Á,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. °∞So guard your heart; do not be unfaithful to your wife.°± / ®ÁHebrew to cover one°Øs garment with violence.
39Mal 2:17 You have wearied the Lord with your words. °∞How have we wearied him?°± you ask. You have wearied him by saying that all who do evil are good in the Lord°Øs sight, and he is pleased with them. You have wearied him by asking, °∞Where is the God of justice?°±
39Mal 3:1 °∞Look! I am sending my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. Then the Lord you are seeking will suddenly come to his Temple. The messenger of the covenant, whom you look for so eagerly, is surely coming,°± says the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.
39Mal 3:2 °∞But who will be able to endure it when he comes? Who will be able to stand and face him when he appears? For he will be like a blazing fire that refines metal, or like a strong soap that bleaches clothes.
