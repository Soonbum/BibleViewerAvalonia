18Jb 1:1 There once was a man named Job who lived in the land of Uz. He was blameless - a man of complete integrity. He feared God and stayed away from evil.
18Jb 1:2 He had seven sons and three daughters.
18Jb 1:3 He owned 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 teams of oxen, and 500 female donkeys. He also had many servants. He was, in fact, the richest person in that entire area.
18Jb 1:4 Job's sons would take turns preparing feasts in their homes, and they would also invite their three sisters to celebrate with them.
18Jb 1:5 When these celebrations ended - sometimes after several days - Job would purify his children. He would get up early in the morning and offer a burnt offering for each of them. For Job said to himself, "Perhaps my children have sinned and have cursed God in their hearts." This was Job's regular practice.
18Jb 1:6 One day the members of the heavenly court®Á came to present themselves before the LORD, and the Accuser, Satan®Ë, came with them. / ®ÁHebrew the sons of God. ®ËHebrew and the satan; similarly throughout this chapter
18Jb 1:7 "Where have you come from?" the LORD asked Satan.Satan answered the LORD, "I have been patrolling the earth, watching everything that's going on."
18Jb 1:8 Then the LORD asked Satan, "Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth. He is blameless - a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil."
18Jb 1:9 Satan replied to the LORD, "Yes, but Job has good reason to fear God.
18Jb 1:10 You have always put a wall of protection around him and his home and his property. You have made him prosper in everything he does. Look how rich he is!
18Jb 1:11 But reach out and take away everything he has, and he will surely curse you to your face!"
18Jb 1:12 "All right, you may test him," the LORD said to Satan. "Do whatever you want with everything he possesses, but don't harm him physically." So Satan left the LORD's presence.
18Jb 1:13 One day when Job's sons and daughters were feasting at the oldest brother's house,
18Jb 1:14 a messenger arrived at Job's home with this news£∫ "Your oxen were plowing, with the donkeys feeding beside them,
18Jb 1:15 when the Sabeans raided us. They stole all the animals and killed all the farmhands. I am the only one who escaped to tell you."
18Jb 1:16 While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news£∫ "The fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up your sheep and all the shepherds. I am the only one who escaped to tell you."
18Jb 1:17 While he was still speaking, a third messenger arrived with this news£∫ "Three bands of Chaldean raiders have stolen your camels and killed your servants. I am the only one who escaped to tell you."
18Jb 1:18 While he was still speaking, another messenger arrived with this news£∫ "Your sons and daughters were feasting in their oldest brother's home.
18Jb 1:19 Suddenly, a powerful wind swept in from the wilderness and hit the house on all sides. The house collapsed, and all your children are dead. I am the only one who escaped to tell you."
18Jb 1:20 Job stood up and tore his robe in grief. Then he shaved his head and fell to the ground to worship.
18Jb 1:21 He said, "I came naked from my mother's womb, and I will be naked when I leave. The LORD gave me what I had, and the LORD has taken it away. Praise the name of the LORD!"
18Jb 1:22 In all of this, Job did not sin by blaming God.
18Jb 2:1 One day the members of the heavenly court®Á came again to present themselves before the LORD, and the Accuser, Satan®Ë, came with them. / ®ÁHebrew the sons of God. ®ËHebrew and the satan; similarly throughout this chapter
18Jb 2:2 "Where have you come from?" the LORD asked Satan.Satan answered the LORD, "I have been patrolling the earth, watching everything that's going on."
18Jb 2:3 Then the LORD asked Satan, "Have you noticed my servant Job? He is the finest man in all the earth. He is blameless - a man of complete integrity. He fears God and stays away from evil. And he has maintained his integrity, even though you urged me to harm him without cause."
18Jb 2:4 Satan replied to the LORD, "Skin for skin! A man will give up everything he has to save his life.
18Jb 2:5 But reach out and take away his health, and he will surely curse you to your face!"
18Jb 2:6 "All right, do with him as you please," the LORD said to Satan. "But spare his life."
18Jb 2:7 So Satan left the LORD's presence, and he struck Job with terrible boils from head to foot.
18Jb 2:8 Job scraped his skin with a piece of broken pottery as he sat among the ashes.
18Jb 2:9 His wife said to him, "Are you still trying to maintain your integrity? Curse God and die."
18Jb 2:10 But Job replied, "You talk like a foolish woman. Should we accept only good things from the hand of God and never anything bad?" So in all this, Job said nothing wrong.
18Jb 2:11 When three of Job's friends heard of the tragedy he had suffered, they got together and traveled from their homes to comfort and console him. Their names were Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite.
18Jb 2:12 When they saw Job from a distance, they scarcely recognized him. Wailing loudly, they tore their robes and threw dust into the air over their heads to show their grief.
18Jb 2:13 Then they sat on the ground with him for seven days and nights. No one said a word to Job, for they saw that his suffering was too great for words.
18Jb 3:1 At last Job spoke, and he cursed the day of his birth.
18Jb 3:2 He said.
18Jb 3:3 "Let the day of my birth be erased, and the night I was conceived.
18Jb 3:4 Let that day be turned to darkness.Let it be lost even to God on high, and let no light shine on it.
18Jb 3:5 Let the darkness and utter gloom claim that day for its own.Let a black cloud overshadow it, and let the darkness terrify it.
18Jb 3:6 Let that night be blotted off the calendar, never again to be counted among the days of the year, never again to appear among the months.
18Jb 3:7 Let that night be childless.Let it have no joy.
18Jb 3:8 Let those who are experts at cursing - whose cursing could rouse Leviathan®Á - curse that day. / ®ÁThe identification of Leviathan is disputed, ranging from an earthly creature to a mythical sea monster in ancient literature
18Jb 3:9 Let its morning stars remain dark.Let it hope for light, but in vain; may it never see the morning light.
18Jb 3:10 Curse that day for failing to shut my mother's womb, for letting me be born to see all this trouble.
18Jb 3:11 "Why wasn't I born dead? Why didn't I die as I came from the womb?
18Jb 3:12 Why was I laid on my mother's lap? Why did she nurse me at her breasts?
18Jb 3:13 Had I died at birth, I would now be at peace.I would be asleep and at rest.
18Jb 3:14 I would rest with the world's kings and prime ministers, whose great buildings now lie in ruins.
18Jb 3:15 I would rest with princes, rich in gold, whose palaces were filled with silver.
18Jb 3:16 Why wasn't I buried like a stillborn child, like a baby who never lives to see the light?
18Jb 3:17 For in death the wicked cause no trouble, and the weary are at rest.
18Jb 3:18 Even captives are at ease in death, with no guards to curse them.
18Jb 3:19 Rich and poor are both there, and the slave is free from his master.
18Jb 3:20 "Oh, why give light to those in misery, and life to those who are bitter?
18Jb 3:21 They long for death, and it won't come.They search for death more eagerly than for hidden treasure.
18Jb 3:22 They're filled with joy when they finally die, and rejoice when they find the grave.
18Jb 3:23 Why is life given to those with no future, those God has surrounded with difficulties?
18Jb 3:24 I cannot eat for sighing; my groans pour out like water.
18Jb 3:25 What I always feared has happened to me.What I dreaded has come true.
18Jb 3:26 I have no peace, no quietness.I have no rest; only trouble comes."
18Jb 4:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied to Job.
18Jb 4:2 "Will you be patient and let me say a word? For who could keep from speaking out?
18Jb 4:3 "In the past you have encouraged many people; you have strengthened those who were weak.
18Jb 4:4 Your words have supported those who were falling; you encouraged those with shaky knees.
18Jb 4:5 But now when trouble strikes, you lose heart.You are terrified when it touches you.
18Jb 4:6 Doesn't your reverence for God give you confidence? Doesn't your life of integrity give you hope?
18Jb 4:7 "Stop and think! Do the innocent die? When have the upright been destroyed?
18Jb 4:8 My experience shows that those who plant trouble and cultivate evil will harvest the same.
18Jb 4:9 A breath from God destroys them.They vanish in a blast of his anger.
18Jb 4:10 The lion roars and the wildcat snarls, but the teeth of strong lions will be broken.
18Jb 4:11 The fierce lion will starve for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness will be scattered.
18Jb 4:12 "This truth was given to me in secret, as though whispered in my ear.
18Jb 4:13 It came to me in a disturbing vision at night, when people are in a deep sleep.
18Jb 4:14 Fear gripped me, and my bones trembled.
18Jb 4:15 A spirit®Á swept past my face, and my hair stood on end®Ë. / ®ÁOr wind; also in 4.16. ®ËOr its wind sent shivers up my spine
18Jb 4:16 The spirit stopped, but I couldn't see its shape.There was a form before my eyes. In the silence I heard a voice say,
18Jb 4:17 'Can a mortal be innocent before God? Can anyone be pure before the Creator?'
18Jb 4:18 "If God does not trust his own angels and has charged his messengers with foolishness,
18Jb 4:19 how much less will he trust people made of clay! They are made of dust, crushed as easily as a moth.
18Jb 4:20 They are alive in the morning but dead by evening, gone forever without a trace.
18Jb 4:21 Their tent-cords are pulled and the tent collapses, and they die in ignorance.
18Jb 5:1 "Cry for help, but will anyone answer you? Which of the angels®Á will help you? / ®ÁHebrew the holy ones
18Jb 5:2 Surely resentment destroys the fool, and jealousy kills the simple.
18Jb 5:3 I have seen that fools may be successful for the moment, but then comes sudden disaster.
18Jb 5:4 Their children are abandoned far from help; they are crushed in court with no one to defend them.
18Jb 5:5 The hungry devour their harvest, even when it is guarded by brambles®Á. The thirsty pant after their wealth. / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew for this phrase is uncertain
18Jb 5:6 But evil does not spring from the soil, and trouble does not sprout from the earth.
18Jb 5:7 People are born for trouble as readily as sparks fly up from a fire.
18Jb 5:8 "If I were you, I would go to God and present my case to him.
18Jb 5:9 He does great things too marvelous to understand.He performs countless miracles.
18Jb 5:10 He gives rain for the earth and water for the fields.
18Jb 5:11 He gives prosperity to the poor and protects those who suffer.
18Jb 5:12 He frustrates the plans of schemers so the work of their hands will not succeed.
18Jb 5:13 He traps the wise in their own cleverness so their cunning schemes are thwarted.
18Jb 5:14 They find it is dark in the daytime, and they grope at noon as if it were night.
18Jb 5:15 He rescues the poor from the cutting words of the strong, and rescues them from the clutches of the powerful.
18Jb 5:16 And so at last the poor have hope, and the snapping jaws of the wicked are shut.
18Jb 5:17 "But consider the joy of those corrected by God! Do not despise the discipline of the Almighty when you sin.
18Jb 5:18 For though he wounds, he also bandages.He strikes, but his hands also heal.
18Jb 5:19 From six disasters he will rescue you; even in the seventh, he will keep you from evil.
18Jb 5:20 He will save you from death in time of famine, from the power of the sword in time of war.
18Jb 5:21 You will be safe from slander and have no fear when destruction comes.
18Jb 5:22 You will laugh at destruction and famine; wild animals will not terrify you.
18Jb 5:23 You will be at peace with the stones of the field, and its wild animals will be at peace with you.
18Jb 5:24 You will know that your home is safe.When you survey your possessions, nothing will be missing.
18Jb 5:25 You will have many children; your descendants will be as plentiful as grass!
18Jb 5:26 You will go to the grave at a ripe old age, like a sheaf of grain harvested at the proper time!
18Jb 5:27 "We have studied life and found all this to be true.Listen to my counsel, and apply it to yourself."
18Jb 6:1 Then Job spoke again.
18Jb 6:2 "If my misery could be weighed and my troubles be put on the scales,
18Jb 6:3 they would outweigh all the sands of the sea.That is why I spoke impulsively.
18Jb 6:4 For the Almighty has struck me down with his arrows.Their poison infects my spirit.God's terrors are lined up against me.
18Jb 6:5 Don't I have a right to complain? Don't wild donkeys bray when they find no grass, and oxen bellow when they have no food?
18Jb 6:6 Don't people complain about unsalted food? Does anyone want the tasteless white of an egg?®Á / ®ÁOr the tasteless juice of the mallow plant?
18Jb 6:7 My appetite disappears when I look at it; I gag at the thought of eating it!
18Jb 6:8 "Oh, that I might have my request, that God would grant my desire.
18Jb 6:9 I wish he would crush me.I wish he would reach out his hand and kill me.
18Jb 6:10 At least I can take comfort in this£∫ Despite the pain, I have not denied the words of the Holy One.
18Jb 6:11 But I don't have the strength to endure.I have nothing to live for.
18Jb 6:12 Do I have the strength of a stone? Is my body made of bronze?
18Jb 6:13 No, I am utterly helpless, without any chance of success.
18Jb 6:14 "One should be kind to a fainting friend, but you accuse me without any fear of the Almighty®Á. / ®ÁOr friend, / or he might lose his fear of the Almighty
18Jb 6:15 My brothers, you have proved as unreliable as a seasonal brook that overflows its banks in the spring
18Jb 6:16 when it is swollen with ice and melting snow.
18Jb 6:17 But when the hot weather arrives, the water disappears.The brook vanishes in the heat.
18Jb 6:18 The caravans turn aside to be refreshed, but there is nothing to drink, so they die.
18Jb 6:19 The caravans from Tema search for this water; the travelers from Sheba hope to find it.
18Jb 6:20 They count on it but are disappointed.When they arrive, their hopes are dashed.
18Jb 6:21 You, too, have given no help.You have seen my calamity, and you are afraid.
18Jb 6:22 But why? Have I ever asked you for a gift? Have I begged for anything of yours for myself?
18Jb 6:23 Have I asked you to rescue me from my enemies, or to save me from ruthless people?
18Jb 6:24 Teach me, and I will keep quiet.Show me what I have done wrong.
18Jb 6:25 Honest words can be painful, but what do your criticisms amount to?
18Jb 6:26 Do you think your words are convincing when you disregard my cry of desperation?
18Jb 6:27 You would even send an orphan into slavery®Á or sell a friend. / ®ÁHebrew even gamble over an orphan
18Jb 6:28 Look at me! Would I lie to your face?
18Jb 6:29 Stop assuming my guilt, for I have done no wrong.
18Jb 6:30 Do you think I am lying? Don't I know the difference between right and wrong?
18Jb 7:1 "Is not all human life a struggle? Our lives are like that of a hired hand,
18Jb 7:2 like a worker who longs for the shade, like a servant waiting to be paid.
18Jb 7:3 I, too, have been assigned months of futility, long and weary nights of misery.
18Jb 7:4 Lying in bed, I think, 'When will it be morning?' But the night drags on, and I toss till dawn.
18Jb 7:5 My body is covered with maggots and scabs.My skin breaks open, oozing with pus.
18Jb 7:6 "My days fly faster than a weaver's shuttle.They end without hope.
18Jb 7:7 O God, remember that my life is but a breath, and I will never again feel happiness.
18Jb 7:8 You see me now, but not for long.You will look for me, but I will be gone.
18Jb 7:9 Just as a cloud dissipates and vanishes, those who die®Á will not come back. / ®ÁHebrew who go down to Sheol
18Jb 7:10 They are gone forever from their home - never to be seen again.
18Jb 7:11 "I cannot keep from speaking.I must express my anguish.My bitter soul must complain.
18Jb 7:12 Am I a sea monster or a dragon that you must place me under guard?
18Jb 7:13 I think, 'My bed will comfort me, and sleep will ease my misery,'
18Jb 7:14 but then you shatter me with dreams and terrify me with visions.
18Jb 7:15 I would rather be strangled - rather die than suffer like this.
18Jb 7:16 I hate my life and don't want to go on living.Oh, leave me alone for my few remaining days.
18Jb 7:17 "What are people, that you should make so much of us, that you should think of us so often?
18Jb 7:18 For you examine us every morning and test us every moment.
18Jb 7:19 Why won't you leave me alone, at least long enough for me to swallow!
18Jb 7:20 If I have sinned, what have I done to you, O watcher of all humanity? Why make me your target? Am I a burden to you?
18Jb 7:21 Why not just forgive my sin and take away my guilt? For soon I will lie down in the dust and die.When you look for me, I will be gone."
18Jb 8:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied to Job.
18Jb 8:2 "How long will you go on like this? You sound like a blustering wind.
18Jb 8:3 Does God twist justice? Does the Almighty twist what is right?
18Jb 8:4 Your children must have sinned against him, so their punishment was well deserved.
18Jb 8:5 But if you pray to God and seek the favor of the Almighty,
18Jb 8:6 and if you are pure and live with integrity, he will surely rise up and restore your happy home.
18Jb 8:7 And though you started with little, you will end with much.
18Jb 8:8 "Just ask the previous generation.Pay attention to the experience of our ancestors.
18Jb 8:9 For we were born but yesterday and know nothing.Our days on earth are as fleeting as a shadow.
18Jb 8:10 But those who came before us will teach you.They will teach you the wisdom of old.
18Jb 8:11 "Can papyrus reeds grow tall without a marsh? Can marsh grass flourish without water?
18Jb 8:12 While they are still flowering, not ready to be cut, they begin to wither more quickly than grass.
18Jb 8:13 The same happens to all who forget God.The hopes of the godless evaporate.
18Jb 8:14 Their confidence hangs by a thread.They are leaning on a spider's web.
18Jb 8:15 They cling to their home for security, but it won't last.They try to hold it tight, but it will not endure.
18Jb 8:16 The godless seem like a lush plant growing in the sunshine, its branches spreading across the garden.
18Jb 8:17 Its roots grow down through a pile of stones; it takes hold on a bed of rocks.
18Jb 8:18 But when it is uprooted, it's as though it never existed!
18Jb 8:19 That's the end of its life, and others spring up from the earth to replace it.
18Jb 8:20 "But look, God will not reject a person of integrity, nor will he lend a hand to the wicked.
18Jb 8:21 He will once again fill your mouth with laughter and your lips with shouts of joy.
18Jb 8:22 Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the home of the wicked will be destroyed."
18Jb 9:1 Then Job spoke again.
18Jb 9:2 "Yes, I know all this is true in principle.But how can a person be declared innocent in God's sight?
18Jb 9:3 If someone wanted to take God to court®Á, would it be possible to answer him even once in a thousand times? / ®ÁOr If God wanted to take someone to court
18Jb 9:4 For God is so wise and so mighty.Who has ever challenged him successfully?
18Jb 9:5 "Without warning, he moves the mountains, overturning them in his anger.
18Jb 9:6 He shakes the earth from its place, and its foundations tremble.
18Jb 9:7 If he commands it, the sun won't rise and the stars won't shine.
18Jb 9:8 He alone has spread out the heavens and marches on the waves of the sea.
18Jb 9:9 He made all the stars - the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the constellations of the southern sky.
18Jb 9:10 He does great things too marvelous to understand.He performs countless miracles.
18Jb 9:11 "Yet when he comes near, I cannot see him.When he moves by, I do not see him go.
18Jb 9:12 If he snatches someone in death, who can stop him? Who dares to ask, 'What are you doing?'
18Jb 9:13 And God does not restrain his anger.Even the monsters of the sea®Á are crushed beneath his feet. / ®ÁHebrew the helpers of Rahab, the name of a mythical sea monster that represents chaos in ancient literature
18Jb 9:14 "So who am I, that I should try to answer God or even reason with him?
18Jb 9:15 Even if I were right, I would have no defense.I could only plead for mercy.
18Jb 9:16 And even if I summoned him and he responded, I'm not sure he would listen to me.
18Jb 9:17 For he attacks me with a storm and repeatedly wounds me without cause.
18Jb 9:18 He will not let me catch my breath, but fills me instead with bitter sorrows.
18Jb 9:19 If it's a question of strength, he's the strong one.If it's a matter of justice, who dares to summon him to court?
18Jb 9:20 Though I am innocent, my own mouth would pronounce me guilty.Though I am blameless, it®Á would prove me wicked. / ®ÁOr he
18Jb 9:21 "I am innocent, but it makes no difference to me - I despise my life.
18Jb 9:22 Innocent or wicked, it is all the same to God.That's why I say, 'He destroys both the blameless and the wicked.'
18Jb 9:23 When a plague®Á sweeps through, he laughs at the death of the innocent. / ®ÁOr disaster
18Jb 9:24 The whole earth is in the hands of the wicked, and God blinds the eyes of the judges.If he's not the one who does it, who is?
18Jb 9:25 "My life passes more swiftly than a runner.It flees away without a glimpse of happiness.
18Jb 9:26 It disappears like a swift papyrus boat, like an eagle swooping down on its prey.
18Jb 9:27 If I decided to forget my complaints, to put away my sad face and be cheerful,
18Jb 9:28 I would still dread all the pain, for I know you will not find me innocent, O God.
18Jb 9:29 Whatever happens, I will be found guilty.So what's the use of trying?
18Jb 9:30 Even if I were to wash myself with soap and clean my hands with lye,
18Jb 9:31 you would plunge me into a muddy ditch, and my own filthy clothing would hate me.
18Jb 9:32 "God is not a mortal like me, so I cannot argue with him or take him to trial.
18Jb 9:33 If only there were a mediator between us, someone who could bring us together.
18Jb 9:34 The mediator could make God stop beating me, and I would no longer live in terror of his punishment.
18Jb 9:35 Then I could speak to him without fear, but I cannot do that in my own strength.
18Jb 10:1 "I am disgusted with my life.Let me complain freely. My bitter soul must complain.
18Jb 10:2 I will say to God, 'Don't simply condemn me - tell me the charge you are bringing against me.
18Jb 10:3 What do you gain by oppressing me? Why do you reject me, the work of your own hands, while smiling on the schemes of the wicked?
18Jb 10:4 Are your eyes like those of a human? Do you see things only as people see them?
18Jb 10:5 Is your lifetime only as long as ours? Is your life so short
18Jb 10:6 that you must quickly probe for my guilt and search for my sin?
18Jb 10:7 Although you know I am not guilty, no one can rescue me from your hands.
18Jb 10:8 "'You formed me with your hands; you made me, yet now you completely destroy me.
18Jb 10:9 Remember that you made me from dust - will you turn me back to dust so soon?
18Jb 10:10 You guided my conception and formed me in the womb®Á. / ®ÁHebrew You poured me out like milk / and curdled me like cheese
18Jb 10:11 You clothed me with skin and flesh, and you knit my bones and sinews together.
18Jb 10:12 You gave me life and showed me your unfailing love.My life was preserved by your care.
18Jb 10:13 "'Yet your real motive - your true intent - 
18Jb 10:14 was to watch me, and if I sinned, you would not forgive my guilt.
18Jb 10:15 If I am guilty, too bad for me; and even if I'm innocent, I can't hold my head high, because I am filled with shame and misery.
18Jb 10:16 And if I hold my head high, you hunt me like a lion and display your awesome power against me.
18Jb 10:17 Again and again you witness against me.You pour out your growing anger on me and bring fresh armies against me.
18Jb 10:18 "'Why, then, did you deliver me from my mother's womb? Why didn't you let me die at birth?
18Jb 10:19 It would be as though I had never existed, going directly from the womb to the grave.
18Jb 10:20 I have only a few days left, so leave me alone, that I may have a moment of comfort
18Jb 10:21 before I leave - never to return - for the land of darkness and utter gloom.
18Jb 10:22 It is a land as dark as midnight, a land of gloom and confusion, where even the light is dark as midnight.'"
18Jb 11:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite replied to Job.
18Jb 11:2 "Shouldn't someone answer this torrent of words? Is a person proved innocent just by a lot of talking?
18Jb 11:3 Should I remain silent while you babble on? When you mock God, shouldn't someone make you ashamed?
18Jb 11:4 You claim, 'My beliefs are pure,' and 'I am clean in the sight of God.'
18Jb 11:5 If only God would speak; if only he would tell you what he thinks!
18Jb 11:6 If only he would tell you the secrets of wisdom, for true wisdom is not a simple matter. Listen! God is doubtless punishing you far less than you deserve!
18Jb 11:7 "Can you solve the mysteries of God? Can you discover everything about the Almighty?
18Jb 11:8 Such knowledge is higher than the heavens - and who are you? It is deeper than the underworld®Á - what do you know? / ®ÁHebrew than Sheol
18Jb 11:9 It is broader than the earth and wider than the sea.
18Jb 11:10 If God comes and puts a person in prison or calls the court to order, who can stop him?
18Jb 11:11 For he knows those who are false, and he takes note of all their sins.
18Jb 11:12 An empty-headed person won't become wise any more than a wild donkey can bear a human child®Á. / ®ÁOr than a wild male donkey can bear a tame colt
18Jb 11:13 "If only you would prepare your heart and lift up your hands to him in prayer!
18Jb 11:14 Get rid of your sins, and leave all iniquity behind you.
18Jb 11:15 Then your face will brighten with innocence.You will be strong and free of fear.
18Jb 11:16 You will forget your misery; it will be like water flowing away.
18Jb 11:17 Your life will be brighter than the noonday.Even darkness will be as bright as morning.
18Jb 11:18 Having hope will give you courage.You will be protected and will rest in safety.
18Jb 11:19 You will lie down unafraid, and many will look to you for help.
18Jb 11:20 But the wicked will be blinded.They will have no escape.Their only hope is death."
18Jb 12:1 Then Job spoke again.
18Jb 12:2 "You people really know everything, don't you? And when you die, wisdom will die with you!
18Jb 12:3 Well, I know a few things myself - and you're no better than I am.Who doesn't know these things you've been saying?
18Jb 12:4 Yet my friends laugh at me, for I call on God and expect an answer. I am a just and blameless man, yet they laugh at me.
18Jb 12:5 People who are at ease mock those in trouble.They give a push to people who are stumbling.
18Jb 12:6 But robbers are left in peace, and those who provoke God live in safety - though God keeps them in his power.
18Jb 12:7 "Just ask the animals, and they will teach you.Ask the birds of the sky, and they will tell you.
18Jb 12:8 Speak to the earth, and it will instruct you.Let the fish in the sea speak to you.
18Jb 12:9 For they all know that my disaster®Á has come from the hand of the LORD. / ®ÁHebrew that this
18Jb 12:10 For the life of every living thing is in his hand, and the breath of every human being.
18Jb 12:11 The ear tests the words it hears just as the mouth distinguishes between foods.
18Jb 12:12 Wisdom belongs to the aged, and understanding to the old.
18Jb 12:13 "But true wisdom and power are found in God; counsel and understanding are his.
18Jb 12:14 What he destroys cannot be rebuilt.When he puts someone in prison, there is no escape.
18Jb 12:15 If he holds back the rain, the earth becomes a desert.If he releases the waters, they flood the earth.
18Jb 12:16 Yes, strength and wisdom are his; deceivers and deceived are both in his power.
18Jb 12:17 He leads counselors away, stripped of good judgment; wise judges become fools.
18Jb 12:18 He removes the royal robe of kings.They are led away with ropes around their waist.
18Jb 12:19 He leads priests away, stripped of status; he overthrows those with long years in power.
18Jb 12:20 He silences the trusted adviser and removes the insight of the elders.
18Jb 12:21 He pours disgrace upon princes and disarms the strong.
18Jb 12:22 "He uncovers mysteries hidden in darkness; he brings light to the deepest gloom.
18Jb 12:23 He builds up nations, and he destroys them.He expands nations, and he abandons them.
18Jb 12:24 He strips kings of understanding and leaves them wandering in a pathless wasteland.
18Jb 12:25 They grope in the darkness without a light.He makes them stagger like drunkards.
18Jb 13:1 "Look, I have seen all this with my own eyes and heard it with my own ears, and now I understand.
18Jb 13:2 I know as much as you do.You are no better than I am.
18Jb 13:3 As for me, I would speak directly to the Almighty.I want to argue my case with God himself.
18Jb 13:4 As for you, you smear me with lies.As physicians, you are worthless quacks.
18Jb 13:5 If only you could be silent! That's the wisest thing you could do.
18Jb 13:6 Listen to my charge; pay attention to my arguments.
18Jb 13:7 "Are you defending God with lies? Do you make your dishonest arguments for his sake?
18Jb 13:8 Will you slant your testimony in his favor? Will you argue God's case for him?
18Jb 13:9 What will happen when he finds out what you are doing? Can you fool him as easily as you fool people?
18Jb 13:10 No, you will be in trouble with him if you secretly slant your testimony in his favor.
18Jb 13:11 Doesn't his majesty terrify you? Doesn't your fear of him overwhelm you?
18Jb 13:12 Your platitudes are as valuable as ashes.Your defense is as fragile as a clay pot.
18Jb 13:13 "Be silent now and leave me alone.Let me speak, and I will face the consequences.
18Jb 13:14 Yes, I will take my life in my hands and say what I really think.
18Jb 13:15 God might kill me, but I have no other hope®Á. I am going to argue my case with him. / ®ÁAn alternate reading in the Masoretic Text reads God might kill me, but I hope in him
18Jb 13:16 But this is what will save me - I am not godless.If I were, I could not stand before him.
18Jb 13:17 "Listen closely to what I am about to say.Hear me out.
18Jb 13:18 I have prepared my case; I will be proved innocent.
18Jb 13:19 Who can argue with me over this? And if you prove me wrong, I will remain silent and die.
18Jb 13:20 "O God, grant me these two things, and then I will be able to face you.
18Jb 13:21 Remove your heavy hand from me, and don't terrify me with your awesome presence.
18Jb 13:22 Now summon me, and I will answer! Or let me speak to you, and you reply.
18Jb 13:23 Tell me, what have I done wrong? Show me my rebellion and my sin.
18Jb 13:24 Why do you turn away from me? Why do you treat me as your enemy?
18Jb 13:25 Would you terrify a leaf blown by the wind? Would you chase dry straw?
18Jb 13:26 "You write bitter accusations against me and bring up all the sins of my youth.
18Jb 13:27 You put my feet in stocks.You examine all my paths.You trace all my footprints.
18Jb 13:28 I waste away like rotting wood, like a moth-eaten coat.
18Jb 14:1 "How frail is humanity! How short is life, how full of trouble!
18Jb 14:2 We blossom like a flower and then wither.Like a passing shadow, we quickly disappear.
18Jb 14:3 Must you keep an eye on such a frail creature and demand an accounting from me?
18Jb 14:4 Who can bring purity out of an impure person? No one!
18Jb 14:5 You have decided the length of our lives.You know how many months we will live, and we are not given a minute longer.
18Jb 14:6 So leave us alone and let us rest! We are like hired hands, so let us finish our work in peace.
18Jb 14:7 "Even a tree has more hope! If it is cut down, it will sprout again and grow new branches.
18Jb 14:8 Though its roots have grown old in the earth and its stump decays,
18Jb 14:9 at the scent of water it will bud and sprout again like a new seedling.
18Jb 14:10 "But when people die, their strength is gone.They breathe their last, and then where are they?
18Jb 14:11 As water evaporates from a lake and a river disappears in drought,
18Jb 14:12 people are laid to rest and do not rise again.Until the heavens are no more, they will not wake up nor be roused from their sleep.
18Jb 14:13 "I wish you would hide me in the grave®Á and forget me there until your anger has passed.But mark your calendar to think of me again! / ®ÁHebrew in Sheol
18Jb 14:14 Can the dead live again? If so, this would give me hope through all my years of struggle, and I would eagerly await the release of death.
18Jb 14:15 You would call and I would answer, and you would yearn for me, your handiwork.
18Jb 14:16 For then you would guard my steps, instead of watching for my sins.
18Jb 14:17 My sins would be sealed in a pouch, and you would cover my guilt.
18Jb 14:18 "But instead, as mountains fall and crumble and as rocks fall from a cliff,
18Jb 14:19 as water wears away the stones and floods wash away the soil, so you destroy people's hope.
18Jb 14:20 You always overpower them, and they pass from the scene.You disfigure them in death and send them away.
18Jb 14:21 They never know if their children grow up in honor or sink to insignificance.
18Jb 14:22 They suffer painfully; their life is full of trouble."
18Jb 15:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied.
18Jb 15:2 "A wise man wouldn't answer with such empty talk! You are nothing but a windbag.
18Jb 15:3 The wise don't engage in empty chatter.What good are such words?
18Jb 15:4 Have you no fear of God, no reverence for him?
18Jb 15:5 Your sins are telling your mouth what to say.Your words are based on clever deception.
18Jb 15:6 Your own mouth condemns you, not I.Your own lips testify against you.
18Jb 15:7 "Were you the first person ever born? Were you born before the hills were made?
18Jb 15:8 Were you listening at God's secret council? Do you have a monopoly on wisdom?
18Jb 15:9 What do you know that we don't? What do you understand that we do not?
18Jb 15:10 On our side are aged, gray-haired men much older than your father!
18Jb 15:11 "Is God's comfort too little for you? Is his gentle word not enough?
18Jb 15:12 What has taken away your reason? What has weakened your vision®Á, / ®ÁOr Why do your eyes flash with anger; Hebrew reads Why do your eyes blink
18Jb 15:13 that you turn against God and say all these evil things?
18Jb 15:14 Can any mortal be pure? Can anyone born of a woman be just?
18Jb 15:15 Look, God does not even trust the angels®Á. Even the heavens are not absolutely pure in his sight. / ®ÁHebrew the holy ones
18Jb 15:16 How much less pure is a corrupt and sinful person with a thirst for wickedness!
18Jb 15:17 "If you will listen, I will show you.I will answer you from my own experience.
18Jb 15:18 And it is confirmed by the reports of wise men who have heard the same thing from their fathers - 
18Jb 15:19 from those to whom the land was given long before any foreigners arrived.
18Jb 15:20 "The wicked writhe in pain throughout their lives.Years of trouble are stored up for the ruthless.
18Jb 15:21 The sound of terror rings in their ears, and even on good days they fear the attack of the destroyer.
18Jb 15:22 They dare not go out into the darkness for fear they will be murdered.
18Jb 15:23 They wander around, saying, 'Where can I find bread?'®Á They know their day of destruction is near. / ®ÁGreek version reads He is appointed to be food for a vulture
18Jb 15:24 That dark day terrifies them.They live in distress and anguish, like a king preparing for battle.
18Jb 15:25 For they shake their fists at God, defying the Almighty.
18Jb 15:26 Holding their strong shields, they defiantly charge against him.
18Jb 15:27 "These wicked people are heavy and prosperous; their waists bulge with fat.
18Jb 15:28 But their cities will be ruined.They will live in abandoned houses that are ready to tumble down.
18Jb 15:29 Their riches will not last, and their wealth will not endure.Their possessions will no longer spread across the horizon.
18Jb 15:30 "They will not escape the darkness.The burning sun will wither their shoots, and the breath of God will destroy them.
18Jb 15:31 Let them no longer fool themselves by trusting in empty riches, for emptiness will be their only reward.
18Jb 15:32 Like trees, they will be cut down in the prime of life; their branches will never again be green.
18Jb 15:33 They will be like a vine whose grapes are harvested too early, like an olive tree that loses its blossoms before the fruit can form.
18Jb 15:34 For the godless are barren.Their homes, enriched through bribery, will burn.
18Jb 15:35 They conceive trouble and give birth to evil.Their womb produces deceit."
18Jb 16:1 Then Job spoke again.
18Jb 16:2 "I have heard all this before.What miserable comforters you are!
18Jb 16:3 Won't you ever stop blowing hot air? What makes you keep on talking?
18Jb 16:4 I could say the same things if you were in my place.I could spout off criticism and shake my head at you.
18Jb 16:5 But if it were me, I would encourage you.I would try to take away your grief.
18Jb 16:6 Instead, I suffer if I defend myself, and I suffer no less if I refuse to speak.
18Jb 16:7 "O God, you have ground me down and devastated my family.
18Jb 16:8 As if to prove I have sinned, you've reduced me to skin and bones.My gaunt flesh testifies against me.
18Jb 16:9 God hates me and angrily tears me apart.He snaps his teeth at me and pierces me with his eyes.
18Jb 16:10 People jeer and laugh at me.They slap my cheek in contempt.A mob gathers against me.
18Jb 16:11 God has handed me over to sinners.He has tossed me into the hands of the wicked.
18Jb 16:12 "I was living quietly until he shattered me.He took me by the neck and broke me in pieces. Then he set me up as his target,
18Jb 16:13 and now his archers surround me.His arrows pierce me without mercy.The ground is wet with my blood®Á. / ®ÁHebrew my gall
18Jb 16:14 Again and again he smashes against me, charging at me like a warrior.
18Jb 16:15 I wear burlap to show my grief.My pride lies in the dust.
18Jb 16:16 My eyes are red with weeping; dark shadows circle my eyes.
18Jb 16:17 Yet I have done no wrong, and my prayer is pure.
18Jb 16:18 "O earth, do not conceal my blood.Let it cry out on my behalf.
18Jb 16:19 Even now my witness is in heaven.My advocate is there on high.
18Jb 16:20 My friends scorn me, but I pour out my tears to God.
18Jb 16:21 I need someone to mediate between God and me, as a person mediates between friends.
18Jb 16:22 For soon I must go down that road from which I will never return.
18Jb 17:1 "My spirit is crushed, and my life is nearly snuffed out.The grave is ready to receive me.
18Jb 17:2 I am surrounded by mockers.I watch how bitterly they taunt me.
18Jb 17:3 "You must defend my innocence, O God, since no one else will stand up for me.
18Jb 17:4 You have closed their minds to understanding, but do not let them triumph.
18Jb 17:5 They betray their friends for their own advantage, so let their children faint with hunger.
18Jb 17:6 "God has made a mockery of me among the people; they spit in my face.
18Jb 17:7 My eyes are swollen with weeping, and I am but a shadow of my former self.
18Jb 17:8 The virtuous are horrified when they see me.The innocent rise up against the ungodly.
18Jb 17:9 The righteous keep moving forward, and those with clean hands become stronger and stronger.
18Jb 17:10 "As for all of you, come back with a better argument, though I still won't find a wise man among you.
18Jb 17:11 My days are over.My hopes have disappeared.My heart's desires are broken.
18Jb 17:12 These men say that night is day; they claim that the darkness is light.
18Jb 17:13 What if I go to the grave®Á and make my bed in darkness? / ®ÁHebrew to Sheol; also in 17.16
18Jb 17:14 What if I call the grave my father, and the maggot my mother or my sister?
18Jb 17:15 Where then is my hope? Can anyone find it?
18Jb 17:16 No, my hope will go down with me to the grave.We will rest together in the dust!"
18Jb 18:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied.
18Jb 18:2 "How long before you stop talking? Speak sense if you want us to answer!
18Jb 18:3 Do you think we are mere animals? Do you think we are stupid?
18Jb 18:4 You may tear out your hair in anger, but will that destroy the earth? Will it make the rocks tremble?
18Jb 18:5 "Surely the light of the wicked will be snuffed out.The sparks of their fire will not glow.
18Jb 18:6 The light in their tent will grow dark.The lamp hanging above them will be quenched.
18Jb 18:7 The confident stride of the wicked will be shortened.Their own schemes will be their downfall.
18Jb 18:8 The wicked walk into a net.They fall into a pit.
18Jb 18:9 A trap grabs them by the heel.A snare holds them tight.
18Jb 18:10 A noose lies hidden on the ground.A rope is stretched across their path.
18Jb 18:11 "Terrors surround the wicked and trouble them at every step.
18Jb 18:12 Hunger depletes their strength, and calamity waits for them to stumble.
18Jb 18:13 Disease eats their skin; death devours their limbs.
18Jb 18:14 They are torn from the security of their homes and are brought down to the king of terrors.
18Jb 18:15 The homes of the wicked will burn down; burning sulfur rains on their houses.
18Jb 18:16 Their roots will dry up, and their branches will wither.
18Jb 18:17 All memory of their existence will fade from the earth, No one will remember their names.
18Jb 18:18 They will be thrust from light into darkness, driven from the world.
18Jb 18:19 They will have neither children nor grandchildren, nor any survivor in the place where they lived.
18Jb 18:20 People in the west are appalled at their fate; people in the east are horrified.
18Jb 18:21 They will say, 'This was the home of a wicked person, the place of one who rejected God.'"
18Jb 19:1 Then Job spoke again.
18Jb 19:2 "How long will you torture me? How long will you try to crush me with your words?
18Jb 19:3 You have already insulted me ten times.You should be ashamed of treating me so badly.
18Jb 19:4 Even if I have sinned, that is my concern, not yours.
18Jb 19:5 You think you're better than I am, using my humiliation as evidence of my sin.
18Jb 19:6 But it is God who has wronged me, capturing me in his net®Á. / ®ÁOr for I am like a city under siege
18Jb 19:7 "I cry out, 'Help!' but no one answers me.I protest, but there is no justice.
18Jb 19:8 God has blocked my way so I cannot move.He has plunged my path into darkness.
18Jb 19:9 He has stripped me of my honor and removed the crown from my head.
18Jb 19:10 He has demolished me on every side, and I am finished.He has uprooted my hope like a fallen tree.
18Jb 19:11 His fury burns against me; he counts me as an enemy.
18Jb 19:12 His troops advance.They build up roads to attack me.They camp all around my tent.
18Jb 19:13 "My relatives stay far away, and my friends have turned against me.
18Jb 19:14 My family is gone, and my close friends have forgotten me.
18Jb 19:15 My servants and maids consider me a stranger.I am like a foreigner to them.
18Jb 19:16 When I call my servant, he doesn't come; I have to plead with him!
18Jb 19:17 My breath is repulsive to my wife.I am rejected by my own family.
18Jb 19:18 Even young children despise me.When I stand to speak, they turn their backs on me.
18Jb 19:19 My close friends detest me.Those I loved have turned against me.
18Jb 19:20 I have been reduced to skin and bones and have escaped death by the skin of my teeth.
18Jb 19:21 "Have mercy on me, my friends, have mercy, for the hand of God has struck me.
18Jb 19:22 Must you also persecute me, like God does? Haven't you chewed me up enough?
18Jb 19:23 "Oh, that my words could be recorded.Oh, that they could be inscribed on a monument,
18Jb 19:24 carved with an iron chisel and filled with lead, engraved forever in the rock.
18Jb 19:25 "But as for me, I know that my Redeemer lives, and he will stand upon the earth at last.
18Jb 19:26 And after my body has decayed, yet in my body I will see God!®Á / ®ÁOr without my body I will see God! The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
18Jb 19:27 I will see him for myself.Yes, I will see him with my own eyes.I am overwhelmed at the thought!
18Jb 19:28 "How dare you go on persecuting me, saying, 'It's his own fault'?
18Jb 19:29 You should fear punishment yourselves, for your attitude deserves punishment.Then you will know that there is indeed a judgment."
18Jb 20:1 Then Zophar the Naamathite replied.
18Jb 20:2 "I must reply because I am greatly disturbed.
18Jb 20:3 I've had to endure your insults, but now my spirit prompts me to reply.
18Jb 20:4 "Don't you realize that from the beginning of time, ever since people were first placed on the earth,
18Jb 20:5 the triumph of the wicked has been short lived and the joy of the godless has been only temporary?
18Jb 20:6 Though the pride of the godless reaches to the heavens and their heads touch the clouds,
18Jb 20:7 yet they will vanish forever, thrown away like their own dung.Those who knew them will ask, 'Where are they?'
18Jb 20:8 They will fade like a dream and not be found.They will vanish like a vision in the night.
18Jb 20:9 Those who once saw them will see them no more.Their families will never see them again.
18Jb 20:10 Their children will beg from the poor, for they must give back their stolen riches.
18Jb 20:11 Though they are young, their bones will lie in the dust.
18Jb 20:12 "They enjoyed the sweet taste of wickedness, letting it melt under their tongue.
18Jb 20:13 They savored it, holding it long in their mouths.
18Jb 20:14 But suddenly the food in their bellies turns sour, a poisonous venom in their stomach.
18Jb 20:15 They will vomit the wealth they swallowed.God won't let them keep it down.
18Jb 20:16 They will suck the poison of cobras.The viper will kill them.
18Jb 20:17 They will never again enjoy streams of olive oil or rivers of milk and honey.
18Jb 20:18 They will give back everything they worked for.Their wealth will bring them no joy.
18Jb 20:19 For they oppressed the poor and left them destitute.They foreclosed on their homes.
18Jb 20:20 They were always greedy and never satisfied.Nothing remains of all the things they dreamed about.
18Jb 20:21 Nothing is left after they finish gorging themselves.Therefore, their prosperity will not endure.
18Jb 20:22 "In the midst of plenty, they will run into trouble and be overcome by misery.
18Jb 20:23 May God give them a bellyful of trouble.May God rain down his anger upon them.
18Jb 20:24 When they try to escape an iron weapon, a bronze-tipped arrow will pierce them.
18Jb 20:25 The arrow is pulled from their back, and the arrowhead glistens with blood®Á. The terrors of death are upon them. / ®ÁHebrew with gall
18Jb 20:26 Their treasures will be thrown into deepest darkness. A wildfire will devour their goods, consuming all they have left.
18Jb 20:27 The heavens will reveal their guilt, and the earth will testify against them.
18Jb 20:28 A flood will sweep away their house.God's anger will descend on them in torrents.
18Jb 20:29 This is the reward that God gives the wicked.It is the inheritance decreed by God."
18Jb 21:1 Then Job spoke again.
18Jb 21:2 "Listen closely to what I am saying.That's one consolation you can give me.
18Jb 21:3 Bear with me, and let me speak.After I have spoken, you may resume mocking me.
18Jb 21:4 "My complaint is with God, not with people.I have good reason to be so impatient.
18Jb 21:5 Look at me and be stunned.Put your hand over your mouth in shock.
18Jb 21:6 When I think about what I am saying, I shudder.My body trembles.
18Jb 21:7 "Why do the wicked prosper, growing old and powerful?
18Jb 21:8 They live to see their children grow up and settle down, and they enjoy their grandchildren.
18Jb 21:9 Their homes are safe from every fear, and God does not punish them.
18Jb 21:10 Their bulls never fail to breed.Their cows bear calves and never miscarry.
18Jb 21:11 They let their children frisk about like lambs.Their little ones skip and dance.
18Jb 21:12 They sing with tambourine and harp.They celebrate to the sound of the flute.
18Jb 21:13 They spend their days in prosperity, then go down to the grave®Á in peace. / ®ÁHebrew to Sheol
18Jb 21:14 And yet they say to God, 'Go away.We want no part of you and your ways.
18Jb 21:15 Who is the Almighty, and why should we obey him? What good will it do us to pray?'
18Jb 21:16 (They think their prosperity is of their own doing, but I will have nothing to do with that kind of thinking.)
18Jb 21:17 "Yet the light of the wicked never seems to be extinguished.Do they ever have trouble? Does God distribute sorrows to them in anger?
18Jb 21:18 Are they driven before the wind like straw? Are they carried away by the storm like chaff? Not at all!
18Jb 21:19 "'Well,' you say, 'at least God will punish their children!' But I say he should punish the ones who sin, so that they understand his judgment.
18Jb 21:20 Let them see their destruction with their own eyes.Let them drink deeply of the anger of the Almighty.
18Jb 21:21 For they will not care what happens to their family after they are dead.
18Jb 21:22 "But who can teach a lesson to God, since he judges even the most powerful?
18Jb 21:23 One person dies in prosperity, completely comfortable and secure,
18Jb 21:24 the picture of good health, vigorous and fit.
18Jb 21:25 Another person dies in bitter poverty, never having tasted the good life.
18Jb 21:26 But both are buried in the same dust, both eaten by the same maggots.
18Jb 21:27 "Look, I know what you're thinking.I know the schemes you plot against me.
18Jb 21:28 You will tell me of rich and wicked people whose houses have vanished because of their sins.
18Jb 21:29 But ask those who have been around, and they will tell you the truth.
18Jb 21:30 Evil people are spared in times of calamity and are allowed to escape disaster.
18Jb 21:31 No one criticizes them openly or pays them back for what they have done.
18Jb 21:32 When they are carried to the grave, an honor guard keeps watch at their tomb.
18Jb 21:33 A great funeral procession goes to the cemetery.Many pay their respects as the body is laid to rest, and the earth gives sweet repose.
18Jb 21:34 "How can your empty cliches comfort me? All your explanations are lies!"
18Jb 22:1 Then Eliphaz the Temanite replied.
18Jb 22:2 "Can a person do anything to help God? Can even a wise person be helpful to him?
18Jb 22:3 Is it any advantage to the Almighty if you are righteous? Would it be any gain to him if you were perfect?
18Jb 22:4 Is it because you're so pious that he accuses you and brings judgment against you?
18Jb 22:5 No, it's because of your wickedness! There's no limit to your sins.
18Jb 22:6 "For example, you must have lent money to your friend and demanded clothing as security.Yes, you stripped him to the bone.
18Jb 22:7 You must have refused water for the thirsty and food for the hungry.
18Jb 22:8 You probably think the land belongs to the powerful and only the privileged have a right to it!
18Jb 22:9 You must have sent widows away empty-handed and crushed the hopes of orphans.
18Jb 22:10 That is why you are surrounded by traps and tremble from sudden fears.
18Jb 22:11 That is why you cannot see in the darkness, and waves of water cover you.
18Jb 22:12 "God is so great - higher than the heavens, higher than the farthest stars.
18Jb 22:13 But you reply, 'That's why God can't see what I am doing! How can he judge through the thick darkness?
18Jb 22:14 For thick clouds swirl about him, and he cannot see us.He is way up there, walking on the vault of heaven.'
18Jb 22:15 "Will you continue on the old paths where evil people have walked?
18Jb 22:16 They were snatched away in the prime of life, the foundations of their lives washed away.
18Jb 22:17 For they said to God, 'Leave us alone! What can the Almighty do to us?'
18Jb 22:18 Yet he was the one who filled their homes with good things, so I will have nothing to do with that kind of thinking.
18Jb 22:19 "The righteous will be happy to see the wicked destroyed, and the innocent will laugh in contempt.
18Jb 22:20 They will say, 'See how our enemies have been destroyed.The last of them have been consumed in the fire.'
18Jb 22:21 "Submit to God, and you will have peace; then things will go well for you.
18Jb 22:22 Listen to his instructions, and store them in your heart.
18Jb 22:23 If you return to the Almighty, you will be restored - so clean up your life.
18Jb 22:24 If you give up your lust for money and throw your precious gold into the river,
18Jb 22:25 the Almighty himself will be your treasure.He will be your precious silver!
18Jb 22:26 "Then you will take delight in the Almighty and look up to God.
18Jb 22:27 You will pray to him, and he will hear you, and you will fulfill your vows to him.
18Jb 22:28 You will succeed in whatever you choose to do, and light will shine on the road ahead of you.
18Jb 22:29 If people are in trouble and you say, 'Help them,' God will save them.
18Jb 22:30 Even sinners will be rescued; they will be rescued because your hands are pure."
18Jb 23:1 Then Job spoke again.
18Jb 23:2 "My complaint today is still a bitter one, and I try hard not to groan aloud.
18Jb 23:3 If only I knew where to find God, I would go to his court.
18Jb 23:4 I would lay out my case and present my arguments.
18Jb 23:5 Then I would listen to his reply and understand what he says to me.
18Jb 23:6 Would he use his great power to argue with me? No, he would give me a fair hearing.
18Jb 23:7 Honest people can reason with him, so I would be forever acquitted by my judge.
18Jb 23:8 I go east, but he is not there.I go west, but I cannot find him.
18Jb 23:9 I do not see him in the north, for he is hidden.I look to the south, but he is concealed.
18Jb 23:10 "But he knows where I am going.And when he tests me, I will come out as pure as gold.
18Jb 23:11 For I have stayed on God's paths; I have followed his ways and not turned aside.
18Jb 23:12 I have not departed from his commands, but have treasured his words more than daily food.
18Jb 23:13 But once he has made his decision, who can change his mind? Whatever he wants to do, he does.
18Jb 23:14 So he will do to me whatever he has planned.He controls my destiny.
18Jb 23:15 No wonder I am so terrified in his presence.When I think of it, terror grips me.
18Jb 23:16 God has made me sick at heart; the Almighty has terrified me.
18Jb 23:17 Darkness is all around me; thick, impenetrable darkness is everywhere.
18Jb 24:1 "Why doesn't the Almighty bring the wicked to judgment? Why must the godly wait for him in vain?
18Jb 24:2 Evil people steal land by moving the boundary markers.They steal livestock and put them in their own pastures.
18Jb 24:3 They take the orphan's donkey and demand the widow's ox as security for a loan.
18Jb 24:4 The poor are pushed off the path; the needy must hide together for safety.
18Jb 24:5 Like wild donkeys in the wilderness, the poor must spend all their time looking for food, searching even in the desert for food for their children.
18Jb 24:6 They harvest a field they do not own, and they glean in the vineyards of the wicked.
18Jb 24:7 All night they lie naked in the cold, without clothing or covering.
18Jb 24:8 They are soaked by mountain showers, and they huddle against the rocks for want of a home.
18Jb 24:9 "The wicked snatch a widow's child from her breast, taking the baby as security for a loan.
18Jb 24:10 The poor must go about naked, without any clothing.They harvest food for others while they themselves are starving.
18Jb 24:11 They press out olive oil without being allowed to taste it, and they tread in the winepress as they suffer from thirst.
18Jb 24:12 The groans of the dying rise from the city, and the wounded cry for help, yet God ignores their moaning.
18Jb 24:13 "Wicked people rebel against the light.They refuse to acknowledge its ways or stay in its paths.
18Jb 24:14 The murderer rises in the early dawn to kill the poor and needy; at night he is a thief.
18Jb 24:15 The adulterer waits for the twilight, saying, 'No one will see me then.' He hides his face so no one will know him.
18Jb 24:16 Thieves break into houses at night and sleep in the daytime.They are not acquainted with the light.
18Jb 24:17 The black night is their morning.They ally themselves with the terrors of the darkness.
18Jb 24:18 "But they disappear like foam down a river.Everything they own is cursed, and they are afraid to enter their own vineyards.
18Jb 24:19 The grave®Á consumes sinners just as drought and heat consume snow. / ®ÁHebrew Sheol
18Jb 24:20 Their own mothers will forget them.Maggots will find them sweet to eat. No one will remember them.Wicked people are broken like a tree in the storm.
18Jb 24:21 They cheat the woman who has no son to help her.They refuse to help the needy widow.
18Jb 24:22 "God, in his power, drags away the rich.They may rise high, but they have no assurance of life.
18Jb 24:23 They may be allowed to live in security, but God is always watching them.
18Jb 24:24 And though they are great now, in a moment they will be gone like all others, cut off like heads of grain.
18Jb 24:25 Can anyone claim otherwise? Who can prove me wrong?"
18Jb 25:1 Then Bildad the Shuhite replied.
18Jb 25:2 "God is powerful and dreadful.He enforces peace in the heavens.
18Jb 25:3 Who is able to count his heavenly army? Doesn't his light shine on all the earth?
18Jb 25:4 How can a mortal be innocent before God? Can anyone born of a woman be pure?
18Jb 25:5 God is more glorious than the moon; he shines brighter than the stars.
18Jb 25:6 In comparison, people are maggots; we mortals are mere worms."
18Jb 26:1 Then Job spoke again.
18Jb 26:2 "How you have helped the powerless! How you have saved the weak!
18Jb 26:3 How you have enlightened my stupidity! What wise advice you have offered!
18Jb 26:4 Where have you gotten all these wise sayings? Whose spirit speaks through you?
18Jb 26:5 "The dead tremble - those who live beneath the waters.
18Jb 26:6 The underworld®Á is naked in God's presence.The place of destruction®Ë is uncovered. / ®ÁHebrew Sheol. ®ËHebrew Abaddon
18Jb 26:7 God stretches the northern sky over empty space and hangs the earth on nothing.
18Jb 26:8 He wraps the rain in his thick clouds, and the clouds don't burst with the weight.
18Jb 26:9 He covers the face of the moon®Á, shrouding it with his clouds. / ®ÁOr covers his throne
18Jb 26:10 He created the horizon when he separated the waters; he set the boundary between day and night.
18Jb 26:11 The foundations of heaven tremble; they shudder at his rebuke.
18Jb 26:12 By his power the sea grew calm.By his skill he crushed the great sea monster®Á. / ®ÁHebrew Rahab, the name of a mythical sea monster that represents chaos in ancient literature
18Jb 26:13 His Spirit made the heavens beautiful, and his power pierced the gliding serpent.
18Jb 26:14 These are just the beginning of all that he does, merely a whisper of his power.Who, then, can comprehend the thunder of his power?"
18Jb 27:1 Job continued speaking.
18Jb 27:2 "I vow by the living God, who has taken away my rights, by the Almighty who has embittered my soul - 
18Jb 27:3 As long as I live, while I have breath from God,
18Jb 27:4 my lips will speak no evil, and my tongue will speak no lies.
18Jb 27:5 I will never concede that you are right; I will defend my integrity until I die.
18Jb 27:6 I will maintain my innocence without wavering.My conscience is clear for as long as I live.
18Jb 27:7 "May my enemy be punished like the wicked, my adversary like those who do evil.
18Jb 27:8 For what hope do the godless have when God cuts them off and takes away their life?
18Jb 27:9 Will God listen to their cry when trouble comes upon them?
18Jb 27:10 Can they take delight in the Almighty? Can they call to God at any time?
18Jb 27:11 I will teach you about God's power.I will not conceal anything concerning the Almighty.
18Jb 27:12 But you have seen all this, yet you say all these useless things to me.
18Jb 27:13 "This is what the wicked will receive from God; this is their inheritance from the Almighty.
18Jb 27:14 They may have many children, but the children will die in war or starve to death.
18Jb 27:15 Those who survive will die of a plague, and not even their widows will mourn them.
18Jb 27:16 "Evil people may have piles of money and may store away mounds of clothing.
18Jb 27:17 But the righteous will wear that clothing, and the innocent will divide that money.
18Jb 27:18 The wicked build houses as fragile as a spider's web®Á, as flimsy as a shelter made of branches. / ®ÁAs in Greek and Syriac versions (see also 8.14); Hebrew reads a moth
18Jb 27:19 The wicked go to bed rich but wake to find that all their wealth is gone.
18Jb 27:20 Terror overwhelms them like a flood, and they are blown away in the storms of the night.
18Jb 27:21 The east wind carries them away, and they are gone.It sweeps them away.
18Jb 27:22 It whirls down on them without mercy.They struggle to flee from its power.
18Jb 27:23 But everyone jeers at them and mocks them.
18Jb 28:1 "People know where to mine silver and how to refine gold.
18Jb 28:2 They know where to dig iron from the earth and how to smelt copper from rock.
18Jb 28:3 They know how to shine light in the darkness and explore the farthest regions of the earth as they search in the dark for ore.
18Jb 28:4 They sink a mine shaft into the earth far from where anyone lives.They descend on ropes, swinging back and forth.
18Jb 28:5 Food is grown on the earth above, but down below, the earth is melted as by fire.
18Jb 28:6 Here the rocks contain precious lapis lazuli, and the dust contains gold.
18Jb 28:7 These are treasures no bird of prey can see, no falcon's eye observe.
18Jb 28:8 No wild animal has walked upon these treasures; no lion has ever set his paw there.
18Jb 28:9 People know how to tear apart flinty rocks and overturn the roots of mountains.
18Jb 28:10 They cut tunnels in the rocks and uncover precious stones.
18Jb 28:11 They dam up the trickling streams and bring to light the hidden treasures.
18Jb 28:12 "But do people know where to find wisdom? Where can they find understanding?
18Jb 28:13 No one knows where to find it, for it is not found among the living.
18Jb 28:14 'It is not here,' says the ocean.'Nor is it here,' says the sea.
18Jb 28:15 It cannot be bought with gold.It cannot be purchased with silver.
18Jb 28:16 It's worth more than all the gold of Ophir, greater than precious onyx or lapis lazuli.
18Jb 28:17 Wisdom is more valuable than gold and crystal.It cannot be purchased with jewels mounted in fine gold.
18Jb 28:18 Coral and jasper are worthless in trying to get it.The price of wisdom is far above rubies.
18Jb 28:19 Precious peridot from Ethiopia®Á cannot be exchanged for it.It's worth more than the purest gold. / ®ÁHebrew from Cush
18Jb 28:20 "But do people know where to find wisdom? Where can they find understanding?
18Jb 28:21 It is hidden from the eyes of all humanity.Even the sharp-eyed birds in the sky cannot discover it.
18Jb 28:22 Destruction®Á and Death say, 'We've heard only rumors of where wisdom can be found.' / ®ÁHebrew Abaddon
18Jb 28:23 "God alone understands the way to wisdom; he knows where it can be found,
18Jb 28:24 for he looks throughout the whole earth and sees everything under the heavens.
18Jb 28:25 He decided how hard the winds should blow and how much rain should fall.
18Jb 28:26 He made the laws for the rain and laid out a path for the lightning.
18Jb 28:27 Then he saw wisdom and evaluated it.He set it in place and examined it thoroughly.
18Jb 28:28 And this is what he says to all humanity£∫ 'The fear of the Lord is true wisdom; to forsake evil is real understanding.'"
18Jb 29:1 Job continued speaking.
18Jb 29:2 "I long for the years gone by when God took care of me,
18Jb 29:3 when he lit up the way before me and I walked safely through the darkness.
18Jb 29:4 When I was in my prime, God's friendship was felt in my home.
18Jb 29:5 The Almighty was still with me, and my children were around me.
18Jb 29:6 My cows produced milk in abundance, and my groves poured out streams of olive oil.
18Jb 29:7 "Those were the days when I went to the city gate and took my place among the honored leaders.
18Jb 29:8 The young stepped aside when they saw me, and even the aged rose in respect at my coming.
18Jb 29:9 The princes stood in silence and put their hands over their mouths.
18Jb 29:10 The highest officials of the city stood quietly, holding their tongues in respect.
18Jb 29:11 "All who heard me praised me.All who saw me spoke well of me.
18Jb 29:12 For I assisted the poor in their need and the orphans who required help.
18Jb 29:13 I helped those without hope, and they blessed me.And I caused the widows' hearts to sing for joy.
18Jb 29:14 Everything I did was honest.Righteousness covered me like a robe, and I wore justice like a turban.
18Jb 29:15 I served as eyes for the blind and feet for the lame.
18Jb 29:16 I was a father to the poor and assisted strangers who needed help.
18Jb 29:17 I broke the jaws of godless oppressors and plucked their victims from their teeth.
18Jb 29:18 "I thought, 'Surely I will die surrounded by my family after a long, good life®Á. / ®ÁHebrew after I have counted my days like sand
18Jb 29:19 For I am like a tree whose roots reach the water, whose branches are refreshed with the dew.
18Jb 29:20 New honors are constantly bestowed on me, and my strength is continually renewed.'
18Jb 29:21 "Everyone listened to my advice.They were silent as they waited for me to speak.
18Jb 29:22 And after I spoke, they had nothing to add, for my counsel satisfied them.
18Jb 29:23 They longed for me to speak as people long for rain.They drank my words like a refreshing spring rain.
18Jb 29:24 When they were discouraged, I smiled at them.My look of approval was precious to them.
18Jb 29:25 Like a chief, I told them what to do.I lived like a king among his troops and comforted those who mourned.
18Jb 30:1 "But now I am mocked by people younger than I, by young men whose fathers are not worthy to run with my sheepdogs.
18Jb 30:2 A lot of good they are to me - those worn-out wretches!
18Jb 30:3 They are gaunt with hunger and flee to the deserts, to desolate and gloomy wastelands.
18Jb 30:4 They pluck wild greens from among the bushes and eat from the roots of broom trees.
18Jb 30:5 They are driven from human society, and people shout at them as if they were thieves.
18Jb 30:6 So now they live in frightening ravines, in caves and among the rocks.
18Jb 30:7 They sound like animals howling among the bushes, huddled together beneath the nettles.
18Jb 30:8 They are nameless fools, outcasts from society.
18Jb 30:9 "And now they mock me with vulgar songs! They taunt me!
18Jb 30:10 They despise me and won't come near me, except to spit in my face.
18Jb 30:11 For God has cut my bowstring.He has humbled me, so they have thrown off all restraint.
18Jb 30:12 These outcasts oppose me to my face.They send me sprawling and lay traps in my path.
18Jb 30:13 They block my road and do everything they can to destroy me. They know I have no one to help me.
18Jb 30:14 They come at me from all directions. They jump on me when I am down.
18Jb 30:15 I live in terror now.My honor has blown away in the wind, and my prosperity has vanished like a cloud.
18Jb 30:16 "And now my life seeps away.Depression haunts my days.
18Jb 30:17 At night my bones are filled with pain, which gnaws at me relentlessly.
18Jb 30:18 With a strong hand, God grabs my shirt.He grips me by the collar of my coat.
18Jb 30:19 He has thrown me into the mud.I'm nothing more than dust and ashes.
18Jb 30:20 "I cry to you, O God, but you don't answer.I stand before you, but you don't even look.
18Jb 30:21 You have become cruel toward me.You use your power to persecute me.
18Jb 30:22 You throw me into the whirlwind and destroy me in the storm.
18Jb 30:23 And I know you are sending me to my death - the destination of all who live.
18Jb 30:24 "Surely no one would turn against the needy when they cry for help in their trouble.
18Jb 30:25 Did I not weep for those in trouble? Was I not deeply grieved for the needy?
18Jb 30:26 So I looked for good, but evil came instead.I waited for the light, but darkness fell.
18Jb 30:27 My heart is troubled and restless.Days of suffering torment me.
18Jb 30:28 I walk in gloom, without sunlight.I stand in the public square and cry for help.
18Jb 30:29 Instead, I am considered a brother to jackals and a companion to owls.
18Jb 30:30 My skin has turned dark, and my bones burn with fever.
18Jb 30:31 My harp plays sad music, and my flute accompanies those who weep.
18Jb 31:1 "I made a covenant with my eyes not to look with lust at a young woman.
18Jb 31:2 For what has God above chosen for us? What is our inheritance from the Almighty on high?
18Jb 31:3 Isn't it calamity for the wicked and misfortune for those who do evil?
18Jb 31:4 Doesn't he see everything I do and every step I take?
18Jb 31:5 "Have I lied to anyone or deceived anyone?
18Jb 31:6 Let God weigh me on the scales of justice, for he knows my integrity.
18Jb 31:7 If I have strayed from his pathway, or if my heart has lusted for what my eyes have seen, or if I am guilty of any other sin,
18Jb 31:8 then let someone else eat the crops I have planted.Let all that I have planted be uprooted.
18Jb 31:9 "If my heart has been seduced by a woman, or if I have lusted for my neighbor's wife,
18Jb 31:10 then let my wife belong to®Á another man; let other men sleep with her. / ®ÁHebrew grind for
18Jb 31:11 For lust is a shameful sin, a crime that should be punished.
18Jb 31:12 It is a fire that burns all the way to hell®Á. It would wipe out everything I own. / ®ÁHebrew to Abaddon
18Jb 31:13 "If I have been unfair to my male or female servants when they brought their complaints to me,
18Jb 31:14 how could I face God? What could I say when he questioned me?
18Jb 31:15 For God created both me and my servants.He created us both in the womb.
18Jb 31:16 "Have I refused to help the poor, or crushed the hopes of widows?
18Jb 31:17 Have I been stingy with my food and refused to share it with orphans?
18Jb 31:18 No, from childhood I have cared for orphans like a father, and all my life I have cared for widows.
18Jb 31:19 Whenever I saw the homeless without clothes and the needy with nothing to wear,
18Jb 31:20 did they not praise me for providing wool clothing to keep them warm?
18Jb 31:21 "If I raised my hand against an orphan, knowing the judges would take my side,
18Jb 31:22 then let my shoulder be wrenched out of place! Let my arm be torn from its socket!
18Jb 31:23 That would be better than facing God's judgment.For if the majesty of God opposes me, what hope is there?
18Jb 31:24 "Have I put my trust in money or felt secure because of my gold?
18Jb 31:25 Have I gloated about my wealth and all that I own?
18Jb 31:26 "Have I looked at the sun shining in the skies, or the moon walking down its silver pathway,
18Jb 31:27 and been secretly enticed in my heart to throw kisses at them in worship?
18Jb 31:28 If so, I should be punished by the judges, for it would mean I had denied the God of heaven.
18Jb 31:29 "Have I ever rejoiced when disaster struck my enemies, or become excited when harm came their way?
18Jb 31:30 No, I have never sinned by cursing anyone or by asking for revenge.
18Jb 31:31 "My servants have never said, 'He let others go hungry.'
18Jb 31:32 I have never turned away a stranger but have opened my doors to everyone.
18Jb 31:33 "Have I tried to hide my sins like other people do, concealing my guilt in my heart?
18Jb 31:34 Have I feared the crowd or the contempt of the masses, so that I kept quiet and stayed indoors?
18Jb 31:35 "If only someone would listen to me! Look, I will sign my name to my defense. Let the Almighty answer me.Let my accuser write out the charges against me.
18Jb 31:36 I would face the accusation proudly.I would wear it like a crown.
18Jb 31:37 For I would tell him exactly what I have done.I would come before him like a prince.
18Jb 31:38 "If my land accuses me and all its furrows cry out together,
18Jb 31:39 or if I have stolen its crops or murdered its owners,
18Jb 31:40 then let thistles grow on that land instead of wheat, and weeds instead of barley." Job's words are ended.
18Jb 32:1 Job's three friends refused to reply further to him because he kept insisting on his innocence.
18Jb 32:2 Then Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite, of the clan of Ram, became angry. He was angry because Job refused to admit that he had sinned and that God was right in punishing him.
18Jb 32:3 He was also angry with Job's three friends, for they made God®Á appear to be wrong by their inability to answer Job's arguments. / ®ÁAs in ancient Hebrew scribal tradition; the Masoretic Text reads Job
18Jb 32:4 Elihu had waited for the others to speak to Job because they were older than he.
18Jb 32:5 But when he saw that they had no further reply, he spoke out angrily.
18Jb 32:6 Elihu son of Barakel the Buzite said, "I am young and you are old, so I held back from telling you what I think.
18Jb 32:7 I thought, 'Those who are older should speak, for wisdom comes with age.'
18Jb 32:8 But there is a spirit®Á within people, the breath of the Almighty within them, that makes them intelligent. / ®ÁOr Spirit; also in 32.18
18Jb 32:9 Sometimes the elders are not wise.Sometimes the aged do not understand justice.
18Jb 32:10 So listen to me, and let me tell you what I think.
18Jb 32:11 "I have waited all this time, listening very carefully to your arguments, listening to you grope for words.
18Jb 32:12 I have listened, but not one of you has refuted Job or answered his arguments.
18Jb 32:13 And don't tell me, 'He is too wise for us.Only God can convince him.'
18Jb 32:14 If Job had been arguing with me, I would not answer with your kind of logic!
18Jb 32:15 You sit there baffled, with nothing more to say.
18Jb 32:16 Should I continue to wait, now that you are silent? Must I also remain silent?
18Jb 32:17 No, I will say my piece.I will speak my mind.
18Jb 32:18 For I am full of pent-up words, and the spirit within me urges me on.
18Jb 32:19 I am like a cask of wine without a vent, like a new wineskin ready to burst!
18Jb 32:20 I must speak to find relief, so let me give my answers.
18Jb 32:21 I won't play favorites or try to flatter anyone.
18Jb 32:22 For if I tried flattery, my Creator would soon destroy me.
18Jb 33:1 "Listen to my words, Job; pay attention to what I have to say.
18Jb 33:2 Now that I have begun to speak, let me continue.
18Jb 33:3 I speak with all sincerity; I speak the truth.
18Jb 33:4 For the Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life.
18Jb 33:5 Answer me, if you can; make your case and take your stand.
18Jb 33:6 Look, you and I both belong to God.I, too, was formed from clay.
18Jb 33:7 So you don't need to be afraid of me.I won't come down hard on you.
18Jb 33:8 "You have spoken in my hearing, and I have heard your very words.
18Jb 33:9 You said, 'I am pure; I am without sin; I am innocent; I have no guilt.
18Jb 33:10 God is picking a quarrel with me, and he considers me his enemy.
18Jb 33:11 He puts my feet in the stocks and watches my every move.'
18Jb 33:12 "But you are wrong, and I will show you why.For God is greater than any human being.
18Jb 33:13 So why are you bringing a charge against him? Why say he does not respond to people's complaints?
18Jb 33:14 For God speaks again and again, though people do not recognize it.
18Jb 33:15 He speaks in dreams, in visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on people as they lie in their beds.
18Jb 33:16 He whispers in their ears and terrifies them with warnings.
18Jb 33:17 He makes them turn from doing wrong; he keeps them from pride.
18Jb 33:18 He protects them from the grave, from crossing over the river of death.
18Jb 33:19 "Or God disciplines people with pain on their sickbeds, with ceaseless aching in their bones.
18Jb 33:20 They lose their appetite for even the most delicious food.
18Jb 33:21 Their flesh wastes away, and their bones stick out.
18Jb 33:22 They are at death's door; the angels of death wait for them.
18Jb 33:23 "But if an angel from heaven appears - a special messenger to intercede for a person and declare that he is upright - 
18Jb 33:24 he will be gracious and say,'Rescue him from the grave, for I have found a ransom for his life.'
18Jb 33:25 Then his body will become as healthy as a child's, firm and youthful again.
18Jb 33:26 When he prays to God, he will be accepted. And God will receive him with joy and restore him to good standing.
18Jb 33:27 He will declare to his friends,'I sinned and twisted the truth, but it was not worth it®Á. / ®ÁGreek version reads but he [God] did not punish me as my sin deserved
18Jb 33:28 God rescued me from the grave, and now my life is filled with light.'
18Jb 33:29 "Yes, God does these things again and again for people.
18Jb 33:30 He rescues them from the grave so they may enjoy the light of life.
18Jb 33:31 Mark this well, Job. Listen to me, for I have more to say.
18Jb 33:32 But if you have anything to say, go ahead.Speak, for I am anxious to see you justified.
18Jb 33:33 But if not, then listen to me.Keep silent and I will teach you wisdom!"
18Jb 34:1 Then Elihu said.
18Jb 34:2 "Listen to me, you wise men.Pay attention, you who have knowledge.
18Jb 34:3 Job said, 'The ear tests the words it hears just as the mouth distinguishes between foods.'
18Jb 34:4 So let us discern for ourselves what is right; let us learn together what is good.
18Jb 34:5 For Job also said, 'I am innocent, but God has taken away my rights.
18Jb 34:6 I am innocent, but they call me a liar.My suffering is incurable, though I have not sinned.'
18Jb 34:7 "Tell me, has there ever been a man like Job, with his thirst for irreverent talk?
18Jb 34:8 He chooses evil people as companions.He spends his time with wicked men.
18Jb 34:9 He has even said, 'Why waste time trying to please God?'
18Jb 34:10 "Listen to me, you who have understanding.Everyone knows that God doesn't sin! The Almighty can do no wrong.
18Jb 34:11 He repays people according to their deeds.He treats people as they deserve.
18Jb 34:12 Truly, God will not do wrong.The Almighty will not twist justice.
18Jb 34:13 Did someone else put the world in his care? Who set the whole world in place?
18Jb 34:14 If God were to take back his spirit and withdraw his breath,
18Jb 34:15 all life would cease, and humanity would turn again to dust.
18Jb 34:16 "Now listen to me if you are wise.Pay attention to what I say.
18Jb 34:17 Could God govern if he hated justice? Are you going to condemn the almighty judge?
18Jb 34:18 For he says to kings, 'You are wicked,' and to nobles, 'You are unjust.'
18Jb 34:19 He doesn't care how great a person may be, and he pays no more attention to the rich than to the poor.He made them all.
18Jb 34:20 In a moment they die.In the middle of the night they pass away; the mighty are removed without human hand.
18Jb 34:21 "For God watches how people live; he sees everything they do.
18Jb 34:22 No darkness is thick enough to hide the wicked from his eyes.
18Jb 34:23 We don't set the time when we will come before God in judgment.
18Jb 34:24 He brings the mighty to ruin without asking anyone, and he sets up others in their place.
18Jb 34:25 He knows what they do, and in the night he overturns and destroys them.
18Jb 34:26 He strikes them down because they are wicked, doing it openly for all to see.
18Jb 34:27 For they turned away from following him.They have no respect for any of his ways.
18Jb 34:28 They cause the poor to cry out, catching God's attention.He hears the cries of the needy.
18Jb 34:29 But if he chooses to remain quiet, who can criticize him? When he hides his face, no one can find him, whether an individual or a nation.
18Jb 34:30 He prevents the godless from ruling so they cannot be a snare to the people.
18Jb 34:31 "Why don't people say to God, 'I have sinned, but I will sin no more'?
18Jb 34:32 Or 'I don't know what evil I have done - tell me.If I have done wrong, I will stop at once'?
18Jb 34:33 "Must God tailor his justice to your demands? But you have rejected him! The choice is yours, not mine.Go ahead, share your wisdom with us.
18Jb 34:34 After all, bright people will tell me, and wise people will hear me say,
18Jb 34:35 'Job speaks out of ignorance; his words lack insight.'
18Jb 34:36 Job, you deserve the maximum penalty for the wicked way you have talked.
18Jb 34:37 For you have added rebellion to your sin; you show no respect, and you speak many angry words against God."
18Jb 35:1 Then Elihu said.
18Jb 35:2 "Do you think it is right for you to claim, 'I am righteous before God'?
18Jb 35:3 For you also ask, 'What's in it for me? What's the use of living a righteous life?'
18Jb 35:4 "I will answer you and all your friends, too.
18Jb 35:5 Look up into the sky, and see the clouds high above you.
18Jb 35:6 If you sin, how does that affect God? Even if you sin again and again, what effect will it have on him?
18Jb 35:7 If you are good, is this some great gift to him? What could you possibly give him?
18Jb 35:8 No, your sins affect only people like yourself, and your good deeds also affect only humans.
18Jb 35:9 "People cry out when they are oppressed.They groan beneath the power of the mighty.
18Jb 35:10 Yet they don't ask, 'Where is God my Creator, the one who gives songs in the night?
18Jb 35:11 Where is the one who makes us smarter than the animals and wiser than the birds of the sky?'
18Jb 35:12 And when they cry out, God does not answer because of their pride.
18Jb 35:13 But it is wrong to say God doesn't listen, to say the Almighty isn't concerned.
18Jb 35:14 You say you can't see him, but he will bring justice if you will only wait®Á. / ®ÁThese verses can also be translated as follows£∫ 13Indeed, God doesn't listen to their empty plea; / the Almighty is not concerned. / 14How much less will he listen when you say you don't see him, / and that your case is before him and you're waiting for justice
18Jb 35:15 You say he does not respond to sinners with anger and is not greatly concerned about wickedness®Á. / ®ÁAs in Greek and Latin versions; the meaning of this Hebrew word is uncertain
18Jb 35:16 But you are talking nonsense, Job.You have spoken like a fool."
18Jb 36:1 Elihu continued speaking.
18Jb 36:2 "Let me go on, and I will show you the truth.For I have not finished defending God!
18Jb 36:3 I will present profound arguments for the righteousness of my Creator.
18Jb 36:4 I am telling you nothing but the truth, for I am a man of great knowledge.
18Jb 36:5 "God is mighty, but he does not despise anyone! He is mighty in both power and understanding.
18Jb 36:6 He does not let the wicked live but gives justice to the afflicted.
18Jb 36:7 He never takes his eyes off the innocent, but he sets them on thrones with kings and exalts them forever.
18Jb 36:8 If they are bound in chains and caught up in a web of trouble,
18Jb 36:9 he shows them the reason.He shows them their sins of pride.
18Jb 36:10 He gets their attention and commands that they turn from evil.
18Jb 36:11 "If they listen and obey God, they will be blessed with prosperity throughout their lives.All their years will be pleasant.
18Jb 36:12 But if they refuse to listen to him, they will be killed by the sword®Á and die from lack of understanding. / ®ÁOr they will cross the river [of death]
18Jb 36:13 For the godless are full of resentment.Even when he punishes them, they refuse to cry out to him for help.
18Jb 36:14 They die when they are young, after wasting their lives in immoral living.
18Jb 36:15 But by means of their suffering, he rescues those who suffer.For he gets their attention through adversity.
18Jb 36:16 "God is leading you away from danger, Job, to a place free from distress.He is setting your table with the best food.
18Jb 36:17 But you are obsessed with whether the godless will be judged.Don't worry, judgment and justice will be upheld.
18Jb 36:18 But watch out, or you may be seduced by wealth®Á. Don't let yourself be bribed into sin. / ®ÁOr But don't let your anger lead you to mockery
18Jb 36:19 Could all your wealth®Á or all your mighty efforts keep you from distress? / ®ÁOr Could all your cries for help
18Jb 36:20 Do not long for the cover of night, for that is when people will be destroyed®Á. / ®Ávs 16-20, The meaning of the Hebrew in this passage is uncertain
18Jb 36:21 Be on guard! Turn back from evil, for God sent this suffering to keep you from a life of evil.
18Jb 36:22 "Look, God is all-powerful.Who is a teacher like him?
18Jb 36:23 No one can tell him what to do, or say to him, 'You have done wrong.'
18Jb 36:24 Instead, glorify his mighty works, singing songs of praise.
18Jb 36:25 Everyone has seen these things, though only from a distance.
18Jb 36:26 "Look, God is greater than we can understand.His years cannot be counted.
18Jb 36:27 He draws up the water vapor and then distills it into rain.
18Jb 36:28 The rain pours down from the clouds, and everyone benefits.
18Jb 36:29 Who can understand the spreading of the clouds and the thunder that rolls forth from heaven?
18Jb 36:30 See how he spreads the lightning around him and how it lights up the depths of the sea.
18Jb 36:31 By these mighty acts he nourishes®Á the people, giving them food in abundance. / ®ÁOr he governs
18Jb 36:32 He fills his hands with lightning bolts and hurls each at its target.
18Jb 36:33 The thunder announces his presence; the storm announces his indignant anger®Á. / ®ÁOr even the cattle know when a storm is coming. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
18Jb 37:1 "My heart pounds as I think of this.It trembles within me.
18Jb 37:2 Listen carefully to the thunder of God's voice as it rolls from his mouth.
18Jb 37:3 It rolls across the heavens, and his lightning flashes in every direction.
18Jb 37:4 Then comes the roaring of the thunder - the tremendous voice of his majesty.He does not restrain it when he speaks.
18Jb 37:5 God's voice is glorious in the thunder.We can't even imagine the greatness of his power.
18Jb 37:6 "He directs the snow to fall on the earth and tells the rain to pour down.
18Jb 37:7 Then everyone stops working so they can watch his power.
18Jb 37:8 The wild animals take cover and stay inside their dens.
18Jb 37:9 The stormy wind comes from its chamber, and the driving winds bring the cold.
18Jb 37:10 God's breath sends the ice, freezing wide expanses of water.
18Jb 37:11 He loads the clouds with moisture, and they flash with his lightning.
18Jb 37:12 The clouds churn about at his direction.They do whatever he commands throughout the earth.
18Jb 37:13 He makes these things happen either to punish people or to show his unfailing love.
18Jb 37:14 "Pay attention to this, Job.Stop and consider the wonderful miracles of God!
18Jb 37:15 Do you know how God controls the storm and causes the lightning to flash from his clouds?
18Jb 37:16 Do you understand how he moves the clouds with wonderful perfection and skill?
18Jb 37:17 When you are sweltering in your clothes and the south wind dies down and everything is still,
18Jb 37:18 he makes the skies reflect the heat like a bronze mirror.Can you do that?
18Jb 37:19 "So teach the rest of us what to say to God.We are too ignorant to make our own arguments.
18Jb 37:20 Should God be notified that I want to speak? Can people even speak when they are confused?®Á / ®ÁOr speak without being swallowed up?
18Jb 37:21 We cannot look at the sun, for it shines brightly in the sky when the wind clears away the clouds.
18Jb 37:22 So also, golden splendor comes from the mountain of God®Á. He is clothed in dazzling splendor. / Or from the north; or from the abode
18Jb 37:23 We cannot imagine the power of the Almighty; but even though he is just and righteous, he does not destroy us.
18Jb 37:24 No wonder people everywhere fear him.All who are wise show him reverence."
18Jb 38:1 Then the LORD answered Job from the whirlwind.
18Jb 38:2 "Who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorant words?
18Jb 38:3 Brace yourself like a man, because I have some questions for you, and you must answer them.
18Jb 38:4 "Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth? Tell me, if you know so much.
18Jb 38:5 Who determined its dimensions and stretched out the surveying line?
18Jb 38:6 What supports its foundations, and who laid its cornerstone
18Jb 38:7 as the morning stars sang together and all the angels®Á shouted for joy? / ®ÁHebrew the sons of God
18Jb 38:8 "Who kept the sea inside its boundaries as it burst from the womb,
18Jb 38:9 and as I clothed it with clouds and wrapped it in thick darkness?
18Jb 38:10 For I locked it behind barred gates, limiting its shores.
18Jb 38:11 I said, 'This far and no farther will you come.Here your proud waves must stop!'
18Jb 38:12 "Have you ever commanded the morning to appear and caused the dawn to rise in the east?
18Jb 38:13 Have you made daylight spread to the ends of the earth, to bring an end to the night's wickedness?
18Jb 38:14 As the light approaches, the earth takes shape like clay pressed beneath a seal; it is robed in brilliant colors®Á. / ®ÁOr its features stand out like folds in a robe
18Jb 38:15 The light disturbs the wicked and stops the arm that is raised in violence.
18Jb 38:16 "Have you explored the springs from which the seas come? Have you explored their depths?
18Jb 38:17 Do you know where the gates of death are located? Have you seen the gates of utter gloom?
18Jb 38:18 Do you realize the extent of the earth? Tell me about it if you know!
18Jb 38:19 "Where does light come from, and where does darkness go?
18Jb 38:20 Can you take each to its home? Do you know how to get there?
18Jb 38:21 But of course you know all this! For you were born before it was all created, and you are so very experienced!
18Jb 38:22 "Have you visited the storehouses of the snow or seen the storehouses of hail?
18Jb 38:23 (I have reserved them as weapons for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war.)
18Jb 38:24 Where is the path to the source of light? Where is the home of the east wind?
18Jb 38:25 "Who created a channel for the torrents of rain? Who laid out the path for the lightning?
18Jb 38:26 Who makes the rain fall on barren land, in a desert where no one lives?
18Jb 38:27 Who sends rain to satisfy the parched ground and make the tender grass spring up?
18Jb 38:28 "Does the rain have a father? Who gives birth to the dew?
18Jb 38:29 Who is the mother of the ice? Who gives birth to the frost from the heavens?
18Jb 38:30 For the water turns to ice as hard as rock, and the surface of the water freezes.
18Jb 38:31 "Can you direct the movement of the stars - binding the cluster of the Pleiades or loosening the cords of Orion?
18Jb 38:32 Can you direct the sequence of the seasons or guide the Bear with her cubs across the heavens?
18Jb 38:33 Do you know the laws of the universe? Can you use them to regulate the earth?
18Jb 38:34 "Can you shout to the clouds and make it rain?
18Jb 38:35 Can you make lightning appear and cause it to strike as you direct?
18Jb 38:36 Who gives intuition to the heart and instinct to the mind?
18Jb 38:37 Who is wise enough to count all the clouds? Who can tilt the water jars of heaven
18Jb 38:38 when the parched ground is dry and the soil has hardened into clods?
18Jb 38:39 "Can you stalk prey for a lioness and satisfy the young lions' appetites
18Jb 38:40 as they lie in their dens or crouch in the thicket?
18Jb 38:41 Who provides food for the ravens when their young cry out to God and wander about in hunger?
18Jb 39:1 "Do you know when the wild goats give birth? Have you watched as deer are born in the wild?
18Jb 39:2 Do you know how many months they carry their young? Are you aware of the time of their delivery?
18Jb 39:3 They crouch down to give birth to their young and deliver their offspring.
18Jb 39:4 Their young grow up in the open fields, then leave home and never return.
18Jb 39:5 "Who gives the wild donkey its freedom? Who untied its ropes?
18Jb 39:6 I have placed it in the wilderness; its home is the wasteland.
18Jb 39:7 It hates the noise of the city and has no driver to shout at it.
18Jb 39:8 The mountains are its pastureland, where it searches for every blade of grass.
18Jb 39:9 "Will the wild ox consent to being tamed? Will it spend the night in your stall?
18Jb 39:10 Can you hitch a wild ox to a plow? Will it plow a field for you?
18Jb 39:11 Given its strength, can you trust it? Can you leave and trust the ox to do your work?
18Jb 39:12 Can you rely on it to bring home your grain and deliver it to your threshing floor?
18Jb 39:13 "The ostrich flaps her wings grandly, but they are no match for the feathers of the stork.
18Jb 39:14 She lays her eggs on top of the earth, letting them be warmed in the dust.
18Jb 39:15 She doesn't worry that a foot might crush them or a wild animal might destroy them.
18Jb 39:16 She is harsh toward her young, as if they were not her own.She doesn't care if they die.
18Jb 39:17 For God has deprived her of wisdom.He has given her no understanding.
18Jb 39:18 But whenever she jumps up to run, she passes the swiftest horse with its rider.
18Jb 39:19 "Have you given the horse its strength or clothed its neck with a flowing mane?
18Jb 39:20 Did you give it the ability to leap like a locust? Its majestic snorting is terrifying!
18Jb 39:21 It paws the earth and rejoices in its strength when it charges out to battle.
18Jb 39:22 It laughs at fear and is unafraid.It does not run from the sword.
18Jb 39:23 The arrows rattle against it, and the spear and javelin flash.
18Jb 39:24 It paws the ground fiercely and rushes forward into battle when the ram's horn blows.
18Jb 39:25 It snorts at the sound of the horn.It senses the battle in the distance.It quivers at the captain's commands and the noise of battle.
18Jb 39:26 "Is it your wisdom that makes the hawk soar and spread its wings toward the south?
18Jb 39:27 Is it at your command that the eagle rises to the heights to make its nest?
18Jb 39:28 It lives on the cliffs, making its home on a distant, rocky crag.
18Jb 39:29 From there it hunts its prey, keeping watch with piercing eyes.
18Jb 39:30 Its young gulp down blood.Where there's a carcass, there you'll find it."
18Jb 40:1 Then the LORD said to Job,
18Jb 40:2 "Do you still want to argue with the Almighty? You are God's critic, but do you have the answers?"
18Jb 40:3 Then Job replied to the LORD,
18Jb 40:4 "I am nothing - how could I ever find the answers? I will cover my mouth with my hand.
18Jb 40:5 I have said too much already.I have nothing more to say."
18Jb 40:6 Then the LORD answered Job from the whirlwind.
18Jb 40:7 "Brace yourself like a man, because I have some questions for you, and you must answer them.
18Jb 40:8 "Will you discredit my justice and condemn me just to prove you are right?
18Jb 40:9 Are you as strong as God? Can you thunder with a voice like his?
18Jb 40:10 All right, put on your glory and splendor, your honor and majesty.
18Jb 40:11 Give vent to your anger.Let it overflow against the proud.
18Jb 40:12 Humiliate the proud with a glance; walk on the wicked where they stand.
18Jb 40:13 Bury them in the dust.Imprison them in the world of the dead.
18Jb 40:14 Then even I would praise you, for your own strength would save you.
18Jb 40:15 "Take a look at Behemoth®Á, which I made, just as I made you.It eats grass like an ox. / ®ÁThe identification of Behemoth is disputed, ranging from an earthly creature to a mythical sea monster in ancient literature
18Jb 40:16 See its powerful loins and the muscles of its belly.
18Jb 40:17 Its tail is as strong as a cedar.The sinews of its thighs are knit tightly together.
18Jb 40:18 Its bones are tubes of bronze.Its limbs are bars of iron.
18Jb 40:19 It is a prime example of God's handiwork, and only its Creator can threaten it.
18Jb 40:20 The mountains offer it their best food, where all the wild animals play.

18Jb 41:3 Will it beg you for mercy or implore you for pity?
18Jb 41:4 Will it agree to work for you, to be your slave for life?
18Jb 41:5 Can you make it a pet like a bird, or give it to your little girls to play with?
18Jb 41:6 Will merchants try to buy it to sell it in their shops?
18Jb 41:7 Will its hide be hurt by spears or its head by a harpoon?
18Jb 41:8 If you lay a hand on it, you will certainly remember the battle that follows.You won't try that again!
18Jb 41:9 ®ÁNo, it is useless to try to capture it.The hunter who attempts it will be knocked down. / ®ÁVerses 41.9-34 are numbered 41.1-26 in Hebrew text

18Jb 41:17 Each scale sticks tight to the next.They interlock and cannot be penetrated.
18Jb 41:18 "When it sneezes, it flashes light! Its eyes are like the red of dawn.
18Jb 41:19 Lightning leaps from its mouth; flames of fire flash out.

18Jb 41:27 Iron is nothing but straw to that creature, and bronze is like rotten wood.
18Jb 41:28 Arrows cannot make it flee.Stones shot from a sling are like bits of grass.
18Jb 41:29 Clubs are like a blade of grass, and it laughs at the swish of javelins.

18Jb 42:2 "I know that you can do anything, and no one can stop you.
18Jb 42:3 You asked, 'Who is this that questions my wisdom with such ignorance?' It is I - and I was talking about things I knew nothing about, things far too wonderful for me.
18Jb 42:4 You said, 'Listen and I will speak! I have some questions for you, and you must answer them.'
18Jb 42:5 I had only heard about you before, but now I have seen you with my own eyes.
18Jb 42:6 I take back everything I said, and I sit in dust and ashes to show my repentance."
18Jb 42:7 After the LORD had finished speaking to Job, he said to Eliphaz the Temanite£∫ "I am angry with you and your two friends, for you have not spoken accurately about me, as my servant Job has.
18Jb 42:8 So take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer a burnt offering for yourselves. My servant Job will pray for you, and I will accept his prayer on your behalf. I will not treat you as you deserve, for you have not spoken accurately about me, as my servant Job has."
18Jb 42:9 So Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite did as the LORD commanded them, and the LORD accepted Job's prayer.
18Jb 42:10 When Job prayed for his friends, the LORD restored his fortunes. In fact, the LORD gave him twice as much as before!
18Jb 42:11 Then all his brothers, sisters, and former friends came and feasted with him in his home.

And each of them brought him a gift of money®Á and a gold ring. / ®ÁHebrew a kesitah; the value or weight of the kesitah is no longer known

18Jb 42:13 He also gave Job seven more sons and three more daughters.
18Jb 42:14 He named his first daughter Jemimah, the second Keziah, and the third Keren-happuch.
18Jb 42:15 In all the land no women were as lovely as the daughters of Job. And their father put them into his will along with their brothers.
18Jb 42:16 Job lived 140 years after that, living to see four generations of his children and grandchildren.
18Jb 42:17 Then he died, an old man who had lived a long, full life.

19Ps 75:9 But as for me, I will always proclaim what God has done; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
19Ps 75:10 For God says, °∞I will break the strength of the wicked, but I will increase the power of the godly.°±
19Ps 76:1 [For the choir director£∫ A psalm of Asaph. A song to be accompanied by stringed instruments.] God is honored in Judah; his name is great in Israel.

19Ps 77:15 By your strong arm, you redeemed your people, the descendants of Jacob and Joseph. Interlude

19Ps 77:19 Your road led through the sea, your pathway through the mighty waters - a pathway no one knew was there!
19Ps 77:20 You led your people along that road like a flock of sheep, with Moses and Aaron as their shepherds.
19Ps 78:1 [A psalm®Á of Asaph.] O my people, listen to my instructions. Open your ears to what I am saying, / ®ÁHebrew maskil. This may be a literary or musical term
19Ps 78:2 for I will speak to you in a parable. I will teach you hidden lessons from our past - 
19Ps 78:3 stories we have heard and known, stories our ancestors handed down to us.
19Ps 78:4 We will not hide these truths from our children; we will tell the next generation about the glorious deeds of the Lord, about his power and his mighty wonders.
19Ps 78:5 For he issued his laws to Jacob; he gave his instructions to Israel. He commanded our ancestors to teach them to their children,
19Ps 78:6 so the next generation might know them - even the children not yet born - and they in turn will teach their own children.
19Ps 78:7 So each generation should set its hope anew on God, not forgetting his glorious miracles and obeying his commands.
19Ps 78:8 Then they will not be like their ancestors - stubborn, rebellious, and unfaithful, refusing to give their hearts to God.
19Ps 78:9 The warriors of Ephraim, though armed with bows, turned their backs and fled on the day of battle.
19Ps 78:10 They did not keep God°Øs covenant and refused to live by his instructions.
19Ps 78:11 They forgot what he had done - the great wonders he had shown them,
19Ps 78:12 the miracles he did for their ancestors on the plain of Zoan in the land of Egypt.
19Ps 78:13 For he divided the sea and led them through, making the water stand up like walls!
19Ps 78:14 In the daytime he led them by a cloud, and all night by a pillar of fire.
19Ps 78:15 He split open the rocks in the wilderness to give them water, as from a gushing spring.
19Ps 78:16 He made streams pour from the rock, making the waters flow down like a river!
19Ps 78:17 Yet they kept on sinning against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.
19Ps 78:18 They stubbornly tested God in their hearts, demanding the foods they craved.
19Ps 78:19 They even spoke against God himself, saying, °∞God can°Øt give us food in the wilderness.
19Ps 78:20 Yes, he can strike a rock so water gushes out, but he can°Øt give his people bread and meat.°±
19Ps 78:21 When the Lord heard them, he was furious. The fire of his wrath burned against Jacob. Yes, his anger rose against Israel,
19Ps 78:22 for they did not believe God or trust him to care for them.
19Ps 78:23 But he commanded the skies to open; he opened the doors of heaven.
19Ps 78:24 He rained down manna for them to eat; he gave them bread from heaven.
19Ps 78:25 They ate the food of angels! God gave them all they could hold.
19Ps 78:26 He released the east wind in the heavens and guided the south wind by his mighty power.
19Ps 78:27 He rained down meat as thick as dust - birds as plentiful as the sand on the seashore!
19Ps 78:28 He caused the birds to fall within their camp and all around their tents.
19Ps 78:29 The people ate their fill. He gave them what they craved.
19Ps 78:30 But before they satisfied their craving, while the meat was yet in their mouths,
19Ps 78:31 the anger of God rose against them, and he killed their strongest men. He struck down the finest of Israel°Øs young men.
19Ps 78:32 But in spite of this, the people kept sinning. Despite his wonders, they refused to trust him.
19Ps 78:33 So he ended their lives in failure, their years in terror.
19Ps 78:34 When God began killing them, they finally sought him. They repented and took God seriously.
19Ps 78:35 Then they remembered that God was their rock, that God Most High®Á was their redeemer. / ®ÁHebrew El-Elyon
19Ps 78:36 But all they gave him was lip service; they lied to him with their tongues.
19Ps 78:37 Their hearts were not loyal to him. They did not keep his covenant.
19Ps 78:38 Yet he was merciful and forgave their sins and did not destroy them all. Many times he held back his anger and did not unleash his fury!
19Ps 78:39 For he remembered that they were merely mortal, gone like a breath of wind that never returns.
19Ps 78:40 Oh, how often they rebelled against him in the wilderness and grieved his heart in that dry wasteland.
19Ps 78:41 Again and again they tested God°Øs patience and provoked the Holy One of Israel.
19Ps 78:42 They did not remember his power and how he rescued them from their enemies.
19Ps 78:43 They did not remember his miraculous signs in Egypt, his wonders on the plain of Zoan.
19Ps 78:44 For he turned their rivers into blood, so no one could drink from the streams.
19Ps 78:45 He sent vast swarms of flies to consume them and hordes of frogs to ruin them.
19Ps 78:46 He gave their crops to caterpillars; their harvest was consumed by locusts.
19Ps 78:47 He destroyed their grapevines with hail and shattered their sycamore-figs with sleet.
19Ps 78:48 He abandoned their cattle to the hail, their livestock to bolts of lightning.
19Ps 78:49 He loosed on them his fierce anger - all his fury, rage, and hostility. He dispatched against them a band of destroying angels.
19Ps 78:50 He turned his anger against them; he did not spare the Egyptians°Ø lives but ravaged them with the plague.
19Ps 78:51 He killed the oldest son in each Egyptian family, the flower of youth throughout the land of Egypt®Á. / ®ÁHebrew in the tents of Ham
19Ps 78:52 But he led his own people like a flock of sheep, guiding them safely through the wilderness.
19Ps 78:53 He kept them safe so they were not afraid; but the sea covered their enemies.
19Ps 78:54 He brought them to the border of his holy land, to this land of hills he had won for them.
19Ps 78:55 He drove out the nations before them; he gave them their inheritance by lot. He settled the tribes of Israel into their homes.
19Ps 78:56 But they kept testing and rebelling against God Most High. They did not obey his laws.
19Ps 78:57 They turned back and were as faithless as their parents. They were as undependable as a crooked bow.
19Ps 78:58 They angered God by building shrines to other gods; they made him jealous with their idols.
19Ps 78:59 When God heard them, he was very angry, and he completely rejected Israel.
19Ps 78:60 Then he abandoned his dwelling at Shiloh, the Tabernacle where he had lived among the people.
19Ps 78:61 He allowed the Ark of his might to be captured; he surrendered his glory into enemy hands.
19Ps 78:62 He gave his people over to be butchered by the sword, because he was so angry with his own people - his special possession.
19Ps 78:63 Their young men were killed by fire; their young women died before singing their wedding songs.
19Ps 78:64 Their priests were slaughtered, and their widows could not mourn their deaths.
19Ps 78:65 Then the Lord rose up as though waking from sleep, like a warrior aroused from a drunken stupor.
19Ps 78:66 He routed his enemies and sent them to eternal shame.
19Ps 78:67 But he rejected Joseph°Øs descendants; he did not choose the tribe of Ephraim.
19Ps 78:68 He chose instead the tribe of Judah, and Mount Zion, which he loved.
19Ps 78:69 There he built his sanctuary as high as the heavens, as solid and enduring as the earth.
19Ps 78:70 He chose his servant David, calling him from the sheep pens.
19Ps 78:71 He took David from tending the ewes and lambs and made him the shepherd of Jacob°Øs descendants - God°Øs own people, Israel.
19Ps 78:72 He cared for them with a true heart and led them with skillful hands.
19Ps 79:1 [A psalm of Asaph.] O God, pagan nations have conquered your land, your special possession. They have defiled your holy Temple and made Jerusalem a heap of ruins.
19Ps 79:2 They have left the bodies of your servants as food for the birds of heaven. The flesh of your godly ones has become food for the wild animals.
19Ps 79:3 Blood has flowed like water all around Jerusalem; no one is left to bury the dead.
19Ps 79:4 We are mocked by our neighbors, an object of scorn and derision to those around us.
19Ps 79:5 O Lord, how long will you be angry with us? Forever? How long will your jealousy burn like fire?
19Ps 79:6 Pour out your wrath on the nations that refuse to acknowledge you - on kingdoms that do not call upon your name.
19Ps 79:7 For they have devoured your people Israel®Á, making the land a desolate wilderness. / ®ÁHebrew devoured Jacob. See note on 44.4
19Ps 79:8 Do not hold us guilty for the sins of our ancestors! Let your compassion quickly meet our needs, for we are on the brink of despair.
19Ps 79:9 Help us, O God of our salvation! Help us for the glory of your name. Save us and forgive our sins for the honor of your name.
19Ps 79:10 Why should pagan nations be allowed to scoff, asking, °∞Where is their God?°± Show us your vengeance against the nations, for they have spilled the blood of your servants.
19Ps 79:11 Listen to the moaning of the prisoners. Demonstrate your great power by saving those condemned to die.
19Ps 79:12 O Lord, pay back our neighbors seven times for the scorn they have hurled at you.
19Ps 79:13 Then we your people, the sheep of your pasture, will thank you forever and ever, praising your greatness from generation to generation.

19Ps 80:7 Turn us again to yourself, O God of Heaven°Øs Armies. Make your face shine down upon us. Only then will we be saved.
19Ps 80:8 You brought us from Egypt like a grapevine; you drove away the pagan nations and transplanted us into your land.
19Ps 80:9 You cleared the ground for us, and we took root and filled the land.
19Ps 80:10 Our shade covered the mountains; our branches covered the mighty cedars.
19Ps 80:11 We spread our branches west to the Mediterranean Sea; our shoots spread east to the Euphrates River®Á. / ®ÁHebrew west to the sea, . . . east to the river
19Ps 80:12 But now, why have you broken down our walls so that all who pass by may steal our fruit?
19Ps 80:13 The wild boar from the forest devours it, and the wild animals feed on it.
19Ps 80:14 Come back, we beg you, O God of Heaven°Øs Armies. Look down from heaven and see our plight. Take care of this grapevine

19Ps 81:11 °∞But no, my people wouldn°Øt listen. Israel did not want me around.

19Ps 104:2 You are dressed in a robe of light. You stretch out the starry curtain of the heavens;
19Ps 104:3 you lay out the rafters of your home in the rain clouds. You make the clouds your chariot; you ride upon the wings of the wind.
19Ps 104:4 The winds are your messengers; flames of fire are your servants®Á. / ®ÁGreek version reads He sends his angels like the winds, / his servants like flames of fire. Compare Heb 1.7

19Ps 104:22 At dawn they slink back into their dens to rest.
19Ps 104:23 Then people go off to their work, where they labor until evening.
19Ps 104:24 O Lord, what a variety of things you have made! In wisdom you have made them all. The earth is full of your creatures.
19Ps 104:25 Here is the ocean, vast and wide, teeming with life of every kind, both large and small.
19Ps 104:26 See the ships sailing along, and Leviathan®Á, which you made to play in the sea. / ®ÁThe identification of Leviathan is disputed, ranging from an earthly creature to a mythical sea monster in ancient literature
19Ps 104:27 They all depend on you to give them food as they need it.
19Ps 104:28 When you supply it, they gather it. You open your hand to feed them, and they are richly satisfied.
19Ps 104:29 But if you turn away from them, they panic. When you take away their breath, they die and turn again to dust.
19Ps 104:30 When you give them your breath®Á, life is created, and you renew the face of the earth. / ®ÁOr When you send your Spirit

19Ps 105:7 He is the Lord our God. His justice is seen throughout the land.
19Ps 105:8 He always stands by his covenant - the commitment he made to a thousand generations.
19Ps 105:9 This is the covenant he made with Abraham and the oath he swore to Isaac.
19Ps 105:10 He confirmed it to Jacob as a decree, and to the people of Israel as a never-ending covenant.
19Ps 105:11 °∞I will give you the land of Canaan as your special possession.°±
19Ps 105:12 He said this when they were few in number, a tiny group of strangers in Canaan.
19Ps 105:13 They wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
19Ps 105:14 Yet he did not let anyone oppress them. He warned kings on their behalf.
19Ps 105:15 °∞Do not touch my chosen people, and do not hurt my prophets.°±
19Ps 105:16 He called for a famine on the land of Canaan, cutting off its food supply.
19Ps 105:17 Then he sent someone to Egypt ahead of them - Joseph, who was sold as a slave.
19Ps 105:18 They bruised his feet with fetters and placed his neck in an iron collar.
19Ps 105:19 Until the time came to fulfill his dreams®Á, the Lord tested Joseph°Øs character. / ®ÁHebrew his word
19Ps 105:20 Then Pharaoh sent for him and set him free; the ruler of the nation opened his prison door.
19Ps 105:21 Joseph was put in charge of all the king°Øs household; he became ruler over all the king°Øs possessions.
19Ps 105:22 He could instruct the king°Øs aides as he pleased and teach the king°Øs advisers.
19Ps 105:23 Then Israel arrived in Egypt; Jacob lived as a foreigner in the land of Ham.
19Ps 105:24 And the Lord multiplied the people of Israel until they became too mighty for their enemies.
19Ps 105:25 Then he turned the Egyptians against the Israelites, and they plotted against the Lord°Øs servants.
19Ps 105:26 But the Lord sent his servant Moses, along with Aaron, whom he had chosen.
19Ps 105:27 They performed miraculous signs among the Egyptians, and wonders in the land of Ham.
19Ps 105:28 The Lord blanketed Egypt in darkness, for they had defied his commands to let his people go.
19Ps 105:29 He turned their water into blood, poisoning all the fish.
19Ps 105:30 Then frogs overran the land and even invaded the king°Øs bedrooms.
19Ps 105:31 When the Lord spoke, flies descended on the Egyptians, and gnats swarmed across Egypt.
19Ps 105:32 He sent them hail instead of rain, and lightning flashed over the land.
19Ps 105:33 He ruined their grapevines and fig trees and shattered all the trees.
19Ps 105:34 He spoke, and hordes of locusts came - young locusts beyond number.
19Ps 105:35 They ate up everything green in the land, destroying all the crops in their fields.
19Ps 105:36 Then he killed the oldest son in each Egyptian home, the pride and joy of each family.
19Ps 105:37 The Lord brought his people out of Egypt, loaded with silver and gold; and not one among the tribes of Israel even stumbled.
19Ps 105:38 Egypt was glad when they were gone, for they feared them greatly.
19Ps 105:39 The Lord spread a cloud above them as a covering and gave them a great fire to light the darkness.
19Ps 105:40 They asked for meat, and he sent them quail; he satisfied their hunger with manna - bread from heaven.
19Ps 105:41 He split open a rock, and water gushed out to form a river through the dry wasteland.
19Ps 105:42 For he remembered his sacred promise to his servant Abraham.
19Ps 105:43 So he brought his people out of Egypt with joy, his chosen ones with rejoicing.
19Ps 105:44 He gave his people the lands of pagan nations, and they harvested crops that others had planted.
19Ps 105:45 All this happened so they would follow his decrees and obey his instructions. Praise the Lord!
19Ps 106:1 Praise the Lord! Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good! His faithful love endures forever.
19Ps 106:2 Who can list the glorious miracles of the Lord? Who can ever praise him enough?
19Ps 106:3 There is joy for those who deal justly with others and always do what is right.
19Ps 106:4 Remember me, Lord, when you show favor to your people; come near and rescue me.
19Ps 106:5 Let me share in the prosperity of your chosen ones. Let me rejoice in the joy of your people; let me praise you with those who are your heritage.
19Ps 106:6 Like our ancestors, we have sinned. We have done wrong! We have acted wickedly!
19Ps 106:7 Our ancestors in Egypt were not impressed by the Lord°Øs miraculous deeds. They soon forgot his many acts of kindness to them. Instead, they rebelled against him at the Red Sea®Á. / ®ÁHebrew at the sea, the sea of reeds
19Ps 106:8 Even so, he saved them - to defend the honor of his name and to demonstrate his mighty power.
19Ps 106:9 He commanded the Red Sea®Á to dry up. He led Israel across the sea as if it were a desert. / ®ÁHebrew sea of reeds; also in 106.22
19Ps 106:10 So he rescued them from their enemies and redeemed them from their foes.
19Ps 106:11 Then the water returned and covered their enemies; not one of them survived.
19Ps 106:12 Then his people believed his promises. Then they sang his praise.
19Ps 106:13 Yet how quickly they forgot what he had done! They wouldn°Øt wait for his counsel!
19Ps 106:14 In the wilderness their desires ran wild, testing God°Øs patience in that dry wasteland.
19Ps 106:15 So he gave them what they asked for, but he sent a plague along with it.
19Ps 106:16 The people in the camp were jealous of Moses and envious of Aaron, the Lord°Øs holy priest.
19Ps 106:17 Because of this, the earth opened up; it swallowed Dathan and buried Abiram and the other rebels.
19Ps 106:18 Fire fell upon their followers; a flame consumed the wicked.
19Ps 106:19 The people made a calf at Mount Sinai®Á; they bowed before an image made of gold. / ®ÁHebrew at Horeb, another name for Sinai
19Ps 106:20 They traded their glorious God for a statue of a grass-eating bull.
19Ps 106:21 They forgot God, their savior, who had done such great things in Egypt - 
19Ps 106:22 such wonderful things in the land of Ham, such awesome deeds at the Red Sea.
19Ps 106:23 So he declared he would destroy them. But Moses, his chosen one, stepped between the Lord and the people. He begged him to turn from his anger and not destroy them.
19Ps 106:24 The people refused to enter the pleasant land, for they wouldn°Øt believe his promise to care for them.
19Ps 106:25 Instead, they grumbled in their tents and refused to obey the Lord.
19Ps 106:26 Therefore, he solemnly swore that he would kill them in the wilderness,
19Ps 106:27 that he would scatter their descendants among the nations, exiling them to distant lands.
19Ps 106:28 Then our ancestors joined in the worship of Baal at Peor; they even ate sacrifices offered to the dead!
19Ps 106:29 They angered the Lord with all these things, so a plague broke out among them.
19Ps 106:30 But Phinehas had the courage to intervene, and the plague was stopped.
19Ps 106:31 So he has been regarded as a righteous man ever since that time.
19Ps 106:32 At Meribah, too, they angered the Lord, causing Moses serious trouble.
19Ps 106:33 They made Moses angry®Á, and he spoke foolishly. / ®ÁHebrew They embittered his spirit
19Ps 106:34 Israel failed to destroy the nations in the land, as the Lord had commanded them.
19Ps 106:35 Instead, they mingled among the pagans and adopted their evil customs.
19Ps 106:36 They worshiped their idols, which led to their downfall.
19Ps 106:37 They even sacrificed their sons and their daughters to the demons.
19Ps 106:38 They shed innocent blood, the blood of their sons and daughters. By sacrificing them to the idols of Canaan, they polluted the land with murder.
19Ps 106:39 They defiled themselves by their evil deeds, and their love of idols was adultery in the Lord°Øs sight.
19Ps 106:40 That is why the Lord°Øs anger burned against his people, and he abhorred his own special possession.
19Ps 106:41 He handed them over to pagan nations, and they were ruled by those who hated them.
19Ps 106:42 Their enemies crushed them and brought them under their cruel power.
19Ps 106:43 Again and again he rescued them, but they chose to rebel against him, and they were finally destroyed by their sin.
19Ps 106:44 Even so, he pitied them in their distress and listened to their cries.
19Ps 106:45 He remembered his covenant with them and relented because of his unfailing love.
19Ps 106:46 He even caused their captors to treat them with kindness.
19Ps 106:47 Save us, O Lord our God! Gather us back from among the nations, so we can thank your holy name and rejoice and praise you.
19Ps 106:48 Praise the Lord, the God of Israel, who lives from everlasting to everlasting! Let all the people say, °∞Amen!°± Praise the Lord!
19Ps 107:1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good! His faithful love endures forever.
19Ps 107:2 Has the Lord redeemed you? Then speak out! Tell others he has redeemed you from your enemies.
19Ps 107:3 For he has gathered the exiles from many lands, from east and west, from north and south.
19Ps 107:4 Some wandered in the wilderness, lost and homeless.
19Ps 107:5 Hungry and thirsty, they nearly died.
19Ps 107:6 °∞Lord, help!°± they cried in their trouble, and he rescued them from their distress.
19Ps 107:7 He led them straight to safety, to a city where they could live.
19Ps 107:8 Let them praise the Lord for his great love and for the wonderful things he has done for them.
19Ps 107:9 For he satisfies the thirsty and fills the hungry with good things.
19Ps 107:10 Some sat in darkness and deepest gloom, imprisoned in iron chains of misery.
19Ps 107:11 They rebelled against the words of God, scorning the counsel of the Most High.
19Ps 107:12 That is why he broke them with hard labor; they fell, and no one was there to help them.
19Ps 107:13 °∞Lord, help!°± they cried in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.
19Ps 107:14 He led them from the darkness and deepest gloom; he snapped their chains.
19Ps 107:15 Let them praise the Lord for his great love and for the wonderful things he has done for them.
19Ps 107:16 For he broke down their prison gates of bronze; he cut apart their bars of iron.
19Ps 107:17 Some were fools; they rebelled and suffered for their sins.
19Ps 107:18 They couldn°Øt stand the thought of food, and they were knocking on death°Øs door.
19Ps 107:19 °∞Lord, help!°± they cried in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.
19Ps 107:20 He sent out his word and healed them, snatching them from the door of death.
19Ps 107:21 Let them praise the Lord for his great love and for the wonderful things he has done for them.
19Ps 107:22 Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and sing joyfully about his glorious acts.
19Ps 107:23 Some went off to sea in ships, plying the trade routes of the world.
19Ps 107:24 They, too, observed the Lord°Øs power in action, his impressive works on the deepest seas.
19Ps 107:25 He spoke, and the winds rose, stirring up the waves.
19Ps 107:26 Their ships were tossed to the heavens and plunged again to the depths; the sailors cringed in terror.
19Ps 107:27 They reeled and staggered like drunkards and were at their wits°Ø end.
19Ps 107:28 °∞Lord, help!°± they cried in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.
19Ps 107:29 He calmed the storm to a whisper and stilled the waves.
19Ps 107:30 What a blessing was that stillness as he brought them safely into harbor!
19Ps 107:31 Let them praise the Lord for his great love and for the wonderful things he has done for them.
19Ps 107:32 Let them exalt him publicly before the congregation and before the leaders of the nation.
19Ps 107:33 He changes rivers into deserts, and springs of water into dry, thirsty land.
19Ps 107:34 He turns the fruitful land into salty wastelands, because of the wickedness of those who live there.
19Ps 107:35 But he also turns deserts into pools of water, the dry land into springs of water.
19Ps 107:36 He brings the hungry to settle there and to build their cities.
19Ps 107:37 They sow their fields, plant their vineyards, and harvest their bumper crops.
19Ps 107:38 How he blesses them! They raise large families there, and their herds of livestock increase.
19Ps 107:39 When they decrease in number and become impoverished through oppression, trouble, and sorrow,
19Ps 107:40 the Lord pours contempt on their princes, causing them to wander in trackless wastelands.
19Ps 107:41 But he rescues the poor from trouble and increases their families like flocks of sheep.
19Ps 107:42 The godly will see these things and be glad, while the wicked are struck silent.
19Ps 107:43 Those who are wise will take all this to heart; they will see in our history the faithful love of the Lord.
19Ps 108:1 [A song. A psalm of David.] My heart is confident in you, O God; no wonder I can sing your praises with all my heart!

19Ps 108:8 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh, too. Ephraim, my helmet, will produce my warriors, and Judah, my scepter, will produce my kings.
19Ps 108:9 But Moab, my washbasin, will become my servant, and I will wipe my feet on Edom and shout in triumph over Philistia.°±
19Ps 108:10 Who will bring me into the fortified city? Who will bring me victory over Edom?
19Ps 108:11 Have you rejected us, O God? Will you no longer march with our armies?
19Ps 108:12 Oh, please help us against our enemies, for all human help is useless.
19Ps 108:13 With God°Øs help we will do mighty things, for he will trample down our foes.

19Ps 109:4 I love them, but they try to destroy me with accusations even as I am praying for them!

19Ps 109:14 May the Lord never forget the sins of his fathers; may his mother°Øs sins never be erased from the record.
19Ps 109:15 May the Lord always remember these sins, and may his name disappear from human memory.
19Ps 109:16 For he refused all kindness to others; he persecuted the poor and needy, and he hounded the brokenhearted to death.
19Ps 109:17 He loved to curse others; now you curse him. He never blessed others; now don°Øt you bless him.
19Ps 109:18 Cursing is as natural to him as his clothing, or the water he drinks, or the rich food he eats.
19Ps 109:19 Now may his curses return and cling to him like clothing; may they be tied around him like a belt.°±
19Ps 109:20 May those curses become the Lord°Øs punishment for my accusers who speak evil of me.
19Ps 109:21 But deal well with me, O Sovereign Lord, for the sake of your own reputation! Rescue me because you are so faithful and good.
19Ps 109:22 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is full of pain.
19Ps 109:23 I am fading like a shadow at dusk; I am brushed off like a locust.
19Ps 109:24 My knees are weak from fasting, and I am skin and bones.
19Ps 109:25 I am a joke to people everywhere; when they see me, they shake their heads in scorn.
19Ps 109:26 Help me, O Lord my God! Save me because of your unfailing love.
19Ps 109:27 Let them see that this is your doing, that you yourself have done it, Lord.
19Ps 109:28 Then let them curse me if they like, but you will bless me! When they attack me, they will be disgraced! But I, your servant, will go right on rejoicing!
19Ps 109:29 May my accusers be clothed with disgrace; may their humiliation cover them like a cloak.
19Ps 109:30 But I will give repeated thanks to the Lord, praising him to everyone.
19Ps 109:31 For he stands beside the needy, ready to save them from those who condemn them.

20Pr 1:4 These proverbs will give insight to the simple, knowledge and discernment to the young.
20Pr 1:5 Let the wise listen to these proverbs and become even wiser. Let those with understanding receive guidance
20Pr 1:6 by exploring the meaning in these proverbs and parables, the words of the wise and their riddles.
20Pr 1:7 Fear of the Lord is the foundation of true knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.
20Pr 1:8 My child®Á, listen when your father corrects you. Don°Øt neglect your mother°Øs instruction. / ®ÁHebrew My son; also in 1.10, 15
20Pr 1:9 What you learn from them will crown you with grace and be a chain of honor around your neck.
20Pr 1:10 My child, if sinners entice you, turn your back on them!
20Pr 1:11 They may say, °∞Come and join us. Let°Øs hide and kill someone! Just for fun, let°Øs ambush the innocent!
20Pr 1:12 Let°Øs swallow them alive, like the grave®Á; let°Øs swallow them whole, like those who go down to the pit of death. / ®ÁHebrew like Sheol
20Pr 1:13 Think of the great things we°Øll get! We°Øll fill our houses with all the stuff we take.
20Pr 1:14 Come, throw in your lot with us; we°Øll all share the loot.°±
20Pr 1:15 My child, don°Øt go along with them! Stay far away from their paths.
20Pr 1:16 They rush to commit evil deeds. They hurry to commit murder.
20Pr 1:17 If a bird sees a trap being set, it knows to stay away.
20Pr 1:18 But these people set an ambush for themselves; they are trying to get themselves killed.
20Pr 1:19 Such is the fate of all who are greedy for money; it robs them of life.
20Pr 1:20 Wisdom shouts in the streets. She cries out in the public square.
20Pr 1:21 She calls to the crowds along the main street, to those gathered in front of the city gate.
20Pr 1:22 °∞How long, you simpletons, will you insist on being simpleminded? How long will you mockers relish your mocking? How long will you fools hate knowledge?
20Pr 1:23 Come and listen to my counsel. I°Øll share my heart with you and make you wise.
20Pr 1:24 °∞I called you so often, but you wouldn°Øt come. I reached out to you, but you paid no attention.
20Pr 1:25 You ignored my advice and rejected the correction I offered.
20Pr 1:26 So I will laugh when you are in trouble! I will mock you when disaster overtakes you - 
20Pr 1:27 when calamity overtakes you like a storm, when disaster engulfs you like a cyclone, and anguish and distress overwhelm you.
20Pr 1:28 °∞When they cry for help, I will not answer. Though they anxiously search for me, they will not find me.
20Pr 1:29 For they hated knowledge and chose not to fear the Lord.
20Pr 1:30 They rejected my advice and paid no attention when I corrected them.
20Pr 1:31 Therefore, they must eat the bitter fruit of living their own way, choking on their own schemes.
20Pr 1:32 For simpletons turn away from me - to death. Fools are destroyed by their own complacency.
20Pr 1:33 But all who listen to me will live in peace, untroubled by fear of harm.°±
20Pr 2:1 My child®Á, listen to what I say, and treasure my commands. / ®ÁHebrew My son
20Pr 2:2 Tune your ears to wisdom, and concentrate on understanding.
20Pr 2:3 Cry out for insight, and ask for understanding.
20Pr 2:4 Search for them as you would for silver; seek them like hidden treasures.
20Pr 2:5 Then you will understand what it means to fear the Lord, and you will gain knowledge of God.
20Pr 2:6 For the Lord grants wisdom! From his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
20Pr 2:7 He grants a treasure of common sense to the honest. He is a shield to those who walk with integrity.
20Pr 2:8 He guards the paths of the just and protects those who are faithful to him.
20Pr 2:9 Then you will understand what is right, just, and fair, and you will find the right way to go.

20Pr 2:11 Wise choices will watch over you. Understanding will keep you safe.
20Pr 2:12 Wisdom will save you from evil people, from those whose words are twisted.
20Pr 2:13 These men turn from the right way to walk down dark paths.
20Pr 2:14 They take pleasure in doing wrong, and they enjoy the twisted ways of evil.
20Pr 2:15 Their actions are crooked, and their ways are wrong.
20Pr 2:16 Wisdom will save you from the immoral woman, from the seductive words of the promiscuous woman.
20Pr 2:17 She has abandoned her husband and ignores the covenant she made before God.
20Pr 2:18 Entering her house leads to death; it is the road to the grave®Á. / ®ÁHebrew to the spirits of the dead
20Pr 2:19 The man who visits her is doomed. He will never reach the paths of life.
20Pr 2:20 Follow the steps of good men instead, and stay on the paths of the righteous.
20Pr 2:21 For only the godly will live in the land, and those with integrity will remain in it.
20Pr 2:22 But the wicked will be removed from the land, and the treacherous will be uprooted.
20Pr 3:1 My child®Á, never forget the things I have taught you. Store my commands in your heart. / ®ÁHebrew My son; also in 3.11, 21
20Pr 3:2 If you do this, you will live many years, and your life will be satisfying.
20Pr 3:3 Never let loyalty and kindness leave you! Tie them around your neck as a reminder. Write them deep within your heart.
20Pr 3:4 Then you will find favor with both God and people, and you will earn a good reputation.
20Pr 3:5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart; do not depend on your own understanding.
20Pr 3:6 Seek his will in all you do, and he will show you which path to take.

20Pr 3:8 Then you will have healing for your body and strength for your bones.
20Pr 3:9 Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the best part of everything you produce.
20Pr 3:10 Then he will fill your barns with grain, and your vats will overflow with good wine.
20Pr 3:11 My child, don°Øt reject the Lord°Øs discipline, and don°Øt be upset when he corrects you.
20Pr 3:12 For the Lord corrects those he loves, just as a father corrects a child in whom he delights®Á. / ®ÁGreek version reads And he punishes those he accepts as his children. Compare Heb 12.6
20Pr 3:13 Joyful is the person who finds wisdom, the one who gains understanding.
20Pr 3:14 For wisdom is more profitable than silver, and her wages are better than gold.
20Pr 3:15 Wisdom is more precious than rubies; nothing you desire can compare with her.
20Pr 3:16 She offers you long life in her right hand, and riches and honor in her left.
20Pr 3:17 She will guide you down delightful paths; all her ways are satisfying.
20Pr 3:18 Wisdom is a tree of life to those who embrace her; happy are those who hold her tightly.
20Pr 3:19 By wisdom the Lord founded the earth; by understanding he created the heavens.
20Pr 3:20 By his knowledge the deep fountains of the earth burst forth, and the dew settles beneath the night sky.
20Pr 3:21 My child, don°Øt lose sight of common sense and discernment. Hang on to them,
20Pr 3:22 for they will refresh your soul. They are like jewels on a necklace.
20Pr 3:23 They keep you safe on your way, and your feet will not stumble.
20Pr 3:24 You can go to bed without fear; you will lie down and sleep soundly.
20Pr 3:25 You need not be afraid of sudden disaster or the destruction that comes upon the wicked,
20Pr 3:26 for the Lord is your security. He will keep your foot from being caught in a trap.
20Pr 3:27 Do not withhold good from those who deserve it when it°Øs in your power to help them.
20Pr 3:28 If you can help your neighbor now, don°Øt say, °∞Come back tomorrow, and then I°Øll help you.°±
20Pr 3:29 Don°Øt plot harm against your neighbor, for those who live nearby trust you.
20Pr 3:30 Don°Øt pick a fight without reason, when no one has done you harm.
20Pr 3:31 Don°Øt envy violent people or copy their ways.
20Pr 3:32 Such wicked people are detestable to the Lord, but he offers his friendship to the godly.
20Pr 3:33 The Lord curses the house of the wicked, but he blesses the home of the upright.
20Pr 3:34 The Lord mocks the mockers but is gracious to the humble®Á. / ®ÁGreek version reads The Lord opposes the proud / but favors the humble. Compare Jas 4.6; 1 Pet 5.5
20Pr 3:35 The wise inherit honor, but fools are put to shame!
20Pr 4:1 My children®Á, listen when your father corrects you. Pay attention and learn good judgment, / ®ÁHebrew My sons
20Pr 4:2 for I am giving you good guidance. Don°Øt turn away from my instructions.
20Pr 4:3 For I, too, was once my father°Øs son, tenderly loved as my mother°Øs only child.
20Pr 4:4 My father taught me, °∞Take my words to heart. Follow my commands, and you will live.
20Pr 4:5 Get wisdom; develop good judgment. Don°Øt forget my words or turn away from them.
20Pr 4:6 Don°Øt turn your back on wisdom, for she will protect you. Love her, and she will guard you.
20Pr 4:7 Getting wisdom is the wisest thing you can do! And whatever else you do, develop good judgment.
20Pr 4:8 If you prize wisdom, she will make you great. Embrace her, and she will honor you.
20Pr 4:9 She will place a lovely wreath on your head; she will present you with a beautiful crown.°±
20Pr 4:10 My child®Á, listen to me and do as I say, and you will have a long, good life. / ®ÁHebrew My son; also in 4.20
20Pr 4:11 I will teach you wisdom°Øs ways and lead you in straight paths.
20Pr 4:12 When you walk, you won°Øt be held back; when you run, you won°Øt stumble.
20Pr 4:13 Take hold of my instructions; don°Øt let them go. Guard them, for they are the key to life.
20Pr 4:14 Don°Øt do as the wicked do, and don°Øt follow the path of evildoers.
20Pr 4:15 Don°Øt even think about it; don°Øt go that way. Turn away and keep moving.
20Pr 4:16 For evil people can°Øt sleep until they°Øve done their evil deed for the day. They can°Øt rest until they°Øve caused someone to stumble.
20Pr 4:17 They eat the food of wickedness and drink the wine of violence!
20Pr 4:18 The way of the righteous is like the first gleam of dawn, which shines ever brighter until the full light of day.
20Pr 4:19 But the way of the wicked is like total darkness. They have no idea what they are stumbling over.
20Pr 4:20 My child, pay attention to what I say. Listen carefully to my words.
20Pr 4:21 Don°Øt lose sight of them. Let them penetrate deep into your heart,
20Pr 4:22 for they bring life to those who find them, and healing to their whole body.
20Pr 4:23 Guard your heart above all else, for it determines the course of your life.
20Pr 4:24 Avoid all perverse talk; stay away from corrupt speech.
20Pr 4:25 Look straight ahead, and fix your eyes on what lies before you.
20Pr 4:26 Mark out a straight path for your feet; stay on the safe path.
20Pr 4:27 Don°Øt get sidetracked; keep your feet from following evil.
20Pr 5:1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom; listen carefully to my wise counsel.
20Pr 5:2 Then you will show discernment, and your lips will express what you°Øve learned.
20Pr 5:3 For the lips of an immoral woman are as sweet as honey, and her mouth is smoother than oil.
20Pr 5:4 But in the end she is as bitter as poison, as dangerous as a double-edged sword.
20Pr 5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead straight to the grave®Á. / ®ÁHebrew to Sheol
20Pr 5:6 For she cares nothing about the path to life. She staggers down a crooked trail and doesn°Øt realize it.
20Pr 5:7 So now, my sons, listen to me. Never stray from what I am about to say.
20Pr 5:8 Stay away from her! Don°Øt go near the door of her house!
20Pr 5:9 If you do, you will lose your honor and will lose to merciless people all you have achieved.
20Pr 5:10 Strangers will consume your wealth, and someone else will enjoy the fruit of your labor.
20Pr 5:11 In the end you will groan in anguish when disease consumes your body.
20Pr 5:12 You will say, °∞How I hated discipline! If only I had not ignored all the warnings!
20Pr 5:13 Oh, why didn°Øt I listen to my teachers? Why didn°Øt I pay attention to my instructors?
20Pr 5:14 I have come to the brink of utter ruin, and now I must face public disgrace.°±
20Pr 5:15 Drink water from your own well - share your love only with your wife®Á. / ®ÁHebrew Drink water from your own cistern, / flowing water from your own well
20Pr 5:16 Why spill the water of your springs in the streets, having sex with just anyone?®Á / ®ÁHebrew Why spill your springs in the streets, / your streams in the city squares?
20Pr 5:17 You should reserve it for yourselves. Never share it with strangers.
20Pr 5:18 Let your wife be a fountain of blessing for you. Rejoice in the wife of your youth.
20Pr 5:19 She is a loving deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts satisfy you always. May you always be captivated by her love.
20Pr 5:20 Why be captivated, my son, by an immoral woman, or fondle the breasts of a promiscuous woman?
20Pr 5:21 For the Lord sees clearly what a man does, examining every path he takes.
20Pr 5:22 An evil man is held captive by his own sins; they are ropes that catch and hold him.
20Pr 5:23 He will die for lack of self-control; he will be lost because of his great foolishness.
20Pr 6:1 My child®Á, if you have put up security for a friend°Øs debt or agreed to guarantee the debt of a stranger - / ®ÁHebrew My son
20Pr 6:2 if you have trapped yourself by your agreement and are caught by what you said - 
20Pr 6:3 follow my advice and save yourself, for you have placed yourself at your friend°Øs mercy. Now swallow your pride; go and beg to have your name erased.
20Pr 6:4 Don°Øt put it off; do it now! Don°Øt rest until you do.
20Pr 6:5 Save yourself like a gazelle escaping from a hunter, like a bird fleeing from a net.
20Pr 6:6 Take a lesson from the ants, you lazybones. Learn from their ways and become wise!
20Pr 6:7 Though they have no prince or governor or ruler to make them work,
20Pr 6:8 they labor hard all summer, gathering food for the winter.
20Pr 6:9 But you, lazybones, how long will you sleep? When will you wake up?
20Pr 6:10 A little extra sleep, a little more slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest - 
20Pr 6:11 then poverty will pounce on you like a bandit; scarcity will attack you like an armed robber.
20Pr 6:12 What are worthless and wicked people like? They are constant liars,
20Pr 6:13 signaling their deceit with a wink of the eye, a nudge of the foot, or the wiggle of fingers.
20Pr 6:14 Their perverted hearts plot evil, and they constantly stir up trouble.
20Pr 6:15 But they will be destroyed suddenly, broken in an instant beyond all hope of healing.
20Pr 6:16 There are six things the Lord hates - no, seven things he detests.
20Pr 6:17 haughty eyes, a lying tongue, hands that kill the innocent,
20Pr 6:18 a heart that plots evil, feet that race to do wrong,
20Pr 6:19 a false witness who pours out lies, a person who sows discord in a family.
20Pr 6:20 My son, obey your father°Øs commands, and don°Øt neglect your mother°Øs instruction.
20Pr 6:21 Keep their words always in your heart. Tie them around your neck.
20Pr 6:22 When you walk, their counsel will lead you. When you sleep, they will protect you. When you wake up, they will advise you.
20Pr 6:23 For their command is a lamp and their instruction a light; their corrective discipline is the way to life.
20Pr 6:24 It will keep you from the immoral woman, from the smooth tongue of a promiscuous woman.
20Pr 6:25 Don°Øt lust for her beauty. Don°Øt let her coy glances seduce you.
20Pr 6:26 For a prostitute will bring you to poverty®Á, but sleeping with another man°Øs wife will cost you your life. / ®ÁHebrew to a loaf of bread
20Pr 6:27 Can a man scoop a flame into his lap and not have his clothes catch on fire?
20Pr 6:28 Can he walk on hot coals and not blister his feet?
20Pr 6:29 So it is with the man who sleeps with another man°Øs wife. He who embraces her will not go unpunished.
20Pr 6:30 Excuses might be found for a thief who steals because he is starving.
20Pr 6:31 But if he is caught, he must pay back seven times what he stole, even if he has to sell everything in his house.
20Pr 6:32 But the man who commits adultery is an utter fool, for he destroys himself.
20Pr 6:33 He will be wounded and disgraced. His shame will never be erased.
20Pr 6:34 For the woman°Øs jealous husband will be furious, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.
20Pr 6:35 He will accept no compensation, nor be satisfied with a payoff of any size.
20Pr 7:1 Follow my advice, my son; always treasure my commands.
20Pr 7:2 Obey my commands and live! Guard my instructions as you guard your own eyes®Á. / ®ÁHebrew as the pupil of your eye
20Pr 7:3 Tie them on your fingers as a reminder. Write them deep within your heart.
20Pr 7:4 Love wisdom like a sister; make insight a beloved member of your family.
20Pr 7:5 Let them protect you from an affair with an immoral woman, from listening to the flattery of a promiscuous woman.
20Pr 7:6 While I was at the window of my house, looking through the curtain,
20Pr 7:7 I saw some naive young men, and one in particular who lacked common sense.
20Pr 7:8 He was crossing the street near the house of an immoral woman, strolling down the path by her house.
20Pr 7:9 It was at twilight, in the evening, as deep darkness fell.
20Pr 7:10 The woman approached him, seductively dressed and sly of heart.
20Pr 7:11 She was the brash, rebellious type, never content to stay at home.
20Pr 7:12 She is often in the streets and markets, soliciting at every corner.
20Pr 7:13 She threw her arms around him and kissed him, and with a brazen look she said,
20Pr 7:14 °∞I°Øve just made my peace offerings and fulfilled my vows.
20Pr 7:15 You°Øre the one I was looking for! I came out to find you, and here you are!
20Pr 7:16 My bed is spread with beautiful blankets, with colored sheets of Egyptian linen.
20Pr 7:17 I°Øve perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

21Ec 1:1 These are the words of the Teacher®Á, King David°Øs son, who ruled in Jerusalem. / ®ÁHebrew Qoheleth; this term is rendered °∞the Teacher°± throughout this book
21Ec 1:2 °∞Everything is meaningless,°± says the Teacher, °∞completely meaningless!°±
21Ec 1:3 What do people get for all their hard work under the sun? 
21Ec 1:4 Generations come and generations go, but the earth never changes. 
21Ec 1:5 The sun rises and the sun sets, then hurries around to rise again. 
21Ec 1:6 The wind blows south, and then turns north. Around and around it goes, blowing in circles. 
21Ec 1:7 Rivers run into the sea, but the sea is never full. Then the water returns again to the rivers and flows out again to the sea. 
21Ec 1:8 Everything is wearisome beyond description. No matter how much we see, we are never satisfied. No matter how much we hear, we are not content.
21Ec 1:9 History merely repeats itself. It has all been done before. Nothing under the sun is truly new. 
21Ec 1:10 Sometimes people say, °∞Here is something new!°± But actually it is old; nothing is ever truly new. 
21Ec 1:11 We don°Øt remember what happened in the past, and in future generations, no one will remember what we are doing now.
21Ec 1:12 I, the Teacher, was king of Israel, and I lived in Jerusalem. 
21Ec 1:13 I devoted myself to search for understanding and to explore by wisdom everything being done under heaven. I soon discovered that God has dealt a tragic existence to the human race. 
21Ec 1:14 I observed everything going on under the sun, and really, it is all meaningless - like chasing the wind.
21Ec 1:15 What is wrong cannot be made right. What is missing cannot be recovered.
21Ec 1:16 I said to myself, °∞Look, I am wiser than any of the kings who ruled in Jerusalem before me. I have greater wisdom and knowledge than any of them.°± 
21Ec 1:17 So I set out to learn everything from wisdom to madness and folly. But I learned firsthand that pursuing all this is like chasing the wind.
21Ec 1:18 The greater my wisdom, the greater my grief. To increase knowledge only increases sorrow.
21Ec 2:1 I said to myself, °∞Come on, let°Øs try pleasure. Let°Øs look for the °Ægood things°Ø in life.°± But I found that this, too, was meaningless. 
21Ec 2:2 So I said, °∞Laughter is silly. What good does it do to seek pleasure?°± 
21Ec 2:3 After much thought, I decided to cheer myself with wine. And while still seeking wisdom, I clutched at foolishness. In this way, I tried to experience the only happiness most people find during their brief life in this world.
21Ec 2:4 I also tried to find meaning by building huge homes for myself and by planting beautiful vineyards. 
21Ec 2:5 I made gardens and parks, filling them with all kinds of fruit trees. 
21Ec 2:6 I built reservoirs to collect the water to irrigate my many flourishing groves. 
21Ec 2:7 I bought slaves, both men and women, and others were born into my household. I also owned large herds and flocks, more than any of the kings who had lived in Jerusalem before me. 
21Ec 2:8 I collected great sums of silver and gold, the treasure of many kings and provinces. I hired wonderful singers, both men and women, and had many beautiful concubines. I had everything a man could desire!
21Ec 2:9 So I became greater than all who had lived in Jerusalem before me, and my wisdom never failed me. 
21Ec 2:10 Anything I wanted, I would take. I denied myself no pleasure. I even found great pleasure in hard work, a reward for all my labors. 
21Ec 2:11 But as I looked at everything I had worked so hard to accomplish, it was all so meaningless - like chasing the wind. There was nothing really worthwhile anywhere.
21Ec 2:12 So I decided to compare wisdom with foolishness and madness (for who can do this better than I, the king?®Á). / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
21Ec 2:13 I thought, °∞Wisdom is better than foolishness, just as light is better than darkness. 
21Ec 2:14 For the wise can see where they are going, but fools walk in the dark.°± Yet I saw that the wise and the foolish share the same fate. 
21Ec 2:15 Both will die. So I said to myself, °∞Since I will end up the same as the fool, what°Øs the value of all my wisdom? This is all so meaningless!°± 
21Ec 2:16 For the wise and the foolish both die. The wise will not be remembered any longer than the fool. In the days to come, both will be forgotten.
21Ec 2:17 So I came to hate life because everything done here under the sun is so troubling. Everything is meaningless - like chasing the wind.
21Ec 2:18 I came to hate all my hard work here on earth, for I must leave to others everything I have earned. 
21Ec 2:19 And who can tell whether my successors will be wise or foolish? Yet they will control everything I have gained by my skill and hard work under the sun. How meaningless! 
21Ec 2:20 So I gave up in despair, questioning the value of all my hard work in this world.
21Ec 2:21 Some people work wisely with knowledge and skill, then must leave the fruit of their efforts to someone who hasn°Øt worked for it. This, too, is meaningless, a great tragedy. 
21Ec 2:22 So what do people get in this life for all their hard work and anxiety? 
21Ec 2:23 Their days of labor are filled with pain and grief; even at night their minds cannot rest. It is all meaningless.
21Ec 2:24 So I decided there is nothing better than to enjoy food and drink and to find satisfaction in work. Then I realized that these pleasures are from the hand of God. 
21Ec 2:25 For who can eat or enjoy anything apart from him?®Á / ®ÁAs in Greek and Syriac versions; Hebrew reads apart from me?
21Ec 2:26 God gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy to those who please him. But if a sinner becomes wealthy, God takes the wealth away and gives it to those who please him. This, too, is meaningless - like chasing the wind.
21Ec 3:1 For everything there is a season, a time for every activity under heaven.
21Ec 3:2 A time to be born and a time to die. A time to plant and a time to harvest.
21Ec 3:3 A time to kill and a time to heal. A time to tear down and a time to build up.
21Ec 3:4 A time to cry and a time to laugh. A time to grieve and a time to dance.
21Ec 3:5 A time to scatter stones and a time to gather stones. A time to embrace and a time to turn away.
21Ec 3:6 A time to search and a time to quit searching. A time to keep and a time to throw away.
21Ec 3:7 A time to tear and a time to mend. A time to be quiet and a time to speak.
21Ec 3:8 A time to love and a time to hate. A time for war and a time for peace.
21Ec 3:9 What do people really get for all their hard work? 
21Ec 3:10 I have seen the burden God has placed on us all. 
21Ec 3:11 Yet God has made everything beautiful for its own time. He has planted eternity in the human heart, but even so, people cannot see the whole scope of God°Øs work from beginning to end. 
21Ec 3:12 So I concluded there is nothing better than to be happy and enjoy ourselves as long as we can. 
21Ec 3:13 And people should eat and drink and enjoy the fruits of their labor, for these are gifts from God.
21Ec 3:14 And I know that whatever God does is final. Nothing can be added to it or taken from it. God°Øs purpose is that people should fear him. 
21Ec 3:15 What is happening now has happened before, and what will happen in the future has happened before, because God makes the same things happen over and over again.
21Ec 3:16 I also noticed that under the sun there is evil in the courtroom. Yes, even the courts of law are corrupt! 
21Ec 3:17 I said to myself, °∞In due season God will judge everyone, both good and bad, for all their deeds.°±
21Ec 3:18 I also thought about the human condition - how God proves to people that they are like animals. 
21Ec 3:19 For people and animals share the same fate - both breathe®Á and both must die. So people have no real advantage over the animals. How meaningless! / ®ÁOr both have the same spirit
21Ec 3:20 Both go to the same place - they came from dust and they return to dust. 
21Ec 3:21 For who can prove that the human spirit goes up and the spirit of animals goes down into the earth? 
21Ec 3:22 So I saw that there is nothing better for people than to be happy in their work. That is why we are here! No one will bring us back from death to enjoy life after we die.
21Ec 4:1 Again, I observed all the oppression that takes place under the sun. I saw the tears of the oppressed, with no one to comfort them. The oppressors have great power, and their victims are helpless. 
21Ec 4:2 So I concluded that the dead are better off than the living. 
21Ec 4:3 But most fortunate of all are those who are not yet born. For they have not seen all the evil that is done under the sun.
21Ec 4:4 Then I observed that most people are motivated to success because they envy their neighbors. But this, too, is meaningless - like chasing the wind.
21Ec 4:5 °∞Fools fold their idle hands, leading them to ruin.°±
21Ec 4:6 And yet, °∞Better to have one handful with quietness than two handfuls with hard work and chasing the wind.°±
21Ec 4:7 I observed yet another example of something meaningless under the sun. 
21Ec 4:8 This is the case of a man who is all alone, without a child or a brother, yet who works hard to gain as much wealth as he can. But then he asks himself, °∞Who am I working for? Why am I giving up so much pleasure now?°± It is all so meaningless and depressing.
21Ec 4:9 Two people are better off than one, for they can help each other succeed. 
21Ec 4:10 If one person falls, the other can reach out and help. But someone who falls alone is in real trouble. 
21Ec 4:11 Likewise, two people lying close together can keep each other warm. But how can one be warm alone? 
21Ec 4:12 A person standing alone can be attacked and defeated, but two can stand back-to-back and conquer. Three are even better, for a triple-braided cord is not easily broken.
21Ec 4:13 It is better to be a poor but wise youth than an old and foolish king who refuses all advice. 
21Ec 4:14 Such a youth could rise from poverty and succeed. He might even become king, though he has been in prison. 
21Ec 4:15 But then everyone rushes to the side of yet another youth®Á who replaces him. / ®ÁHebrew the second youth
21Ec 4:16 Endless crowds stand around him®Á, but then another generation grows up and rejects him, too. So it is all meaningless - like chasing the wind. / ®ÁHebrew There is no end to all the people, to all those who are before them
21Ec 5:1 ®ÁAs you enter the house of God, keep your ears open and your mouth shut. It is evil to make mindless offerings to God. / ®ÁVerse 5.1 is numbered 4.17 in Hebrew text
21Ec 5:2 ®ÁDon°Øt make rash promises, and don°Øt be hasty in bringing matters before God. After all, God is in heaven, and you are here on earth. So let your words be few. / ®ÁVerses 5.2-20 are numbered 5.1-19 in Hebrew text
21Ec 5:3 Too much activity gives you restless dreams; too many words make you a fool.
21Ec 5:4 When you make a promise to God, don°Øt delay in following through, for God takes no pleasure in fools. Keep all the promises you make to him. 
21Ec 5:5 It is better to say nothing than to make a promise and not keep it. 
21Ec 5:6 Don°Øt let your mouth make you sin. And don°Øt defend yourself by telling the Temple messenger that the promise you made was a mistake. That would make God angry, and he might wipe out everything you have achieved.
21Ec 5:7 Talk is cheap, like daydreams and other useless activities. Fear God instead.
21Ec 5:8 Don°Øt be surprised if you see a poor person being oppressed by the powerful and if justice is being miscarried throughout the land. For every official is under orders from higher up, and matters of justice get lost in red tape and bureaucracy. 
21Ec 5:9 Even the king milks the land for his own profit!®Á / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew in verses 8 and 9 is uncertain
21Ec 5:10 Those who love money will never have enough. How meaningless to think that wealth brings true happiness! 
21Ec 5:11 The more you have, the more people come to help you spend it. So what good is wealth - except perhaps to watch it slip through your fingers!
21Ec 5:12 People who work hard sleep well, whether they eat little or much. But the rich seldom get a good night°Øs sleep.
21Ec 5:13 There is another serious problem I have seen under the sun. Hoarding riches harms the saver. 
21Ec 5:14 Money is put into risky investments that turn sour, and everything is lost. In the end, there is nothing left to pass on to one°Øs children. 
21Ec 5:15 We all come to the end of our lives as naked and empty-handed as on the day we were born. We can°Øt take our riches with us.
21Ec 5:16 And this, too, is a very serious problem. People leave this world no better off than when they came. All their hard work is for nothing - like working for the wind. 
21Ec 5:17 Throughout their lives, they live under a cloud - frustrated, discouraged, and angry.
21Ec 5:18 Even so, I have noticed one thing, at least, that is good. It is good for people to eat, drink, and enjoy their work under the sun during the short life God has given them, and to accept their lot in life. 
21Ec 5:19 And it is a good thing to receive wealth from God and the good health to enjoy it. To enjoy your work and accept your lot in life - this is indeed a gift from God. 
21Ec 5:20 God keeps such people so busy enjoying life that they take no time to brood over the past.
21Ec 6:1 There is another serious tragedy I have seen under the sun, and it weighs heavily on humanity.
21Ec 6:2 God gives some people great wealth and honor and everything they could ever want, but then he doesn°Øt give them the chance to enjoy these things. They die, and someone else, even a stranger, ends up enjoying their wealth! This is meaningless - a sickening tragedy.
21Ec 6:3 A man might have a hundred children and live to be very old. But if he finds no satisfaction in life and doesn°Øt even get a decent burial, it would have been better for him to be born dead. 
21Ec 6:4 His birth would have been meaningless, and he would have ended in darkness. He wouldn°Øt even have had a name, 
21Ec 6:5 and he would never have seen the sun or known of its existence. Yet he would have had more peace than in growing up to be an unhappy man. 
21Ec 6:6 He might live a thousand years twice over but still not find contentment. And since he must die like everyone else - well, what°Øs the use?
21Ec 6:7 All people spend their lives scratching for food, but they never seem to have enough. 
21Ec 6:8 So are wise people really better off than fools? Do poor people gain anything by being wise and knowing how to act in front of others?
21Ec 6:9 Enjoy what you have rather than desiring what you don°Øt have. Just dreaming about nice things is meaningless - like chasing the wind.
21Ec 6:10 Everything has already been decided. It was known long ago what each person would be. So there°Øs no use arguing with God about your destiny.
21Ec 6:11 The more words you speak, the less they mean. So what good are they?
21Ec 6:12 In the few days of our meaningless lives, who knows how our days can best be spent? Our lives are like a shadow. Who can tell what will happen on this earth after we are gone?
21Ec 7:1 A good reputation is more valuable than costly perfume. And the day you die is better than the day you are born.
21Ec 7:2 Better to spend your time at funerals than at parties. After all, everyone dies - so the living should take this to heart.
21Ec 7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter, for sadness has a refining influence on us.
21Ec 7:4 A wise person thinks a lot about death, while a fool thinks only about having a good time.
21Ec 7:5 Better to be criticized by a wise person than to be praised by a fool.
21Ec 7:6 A fool°Øs laughter is quickly gone, like thorns crackling in a fire. This also is meaningless.
21Ec 7:7 Extortion turns wise people into fools, and bribes corrupt the heart.
21Ec 7:8 Finishing is better than starting. Patience is better than pride.
21Ec 7:9 Control your temper, for anger labels you a fool.
21Ec 7:10 Don°Øt long for °∞the good old days.°± This is not wise.
21Ec 7:11 Wisdom is even better when you have money. Both are a benefit as you go through life.
21Ec 7:12 Wisdom and money can get you almost anything, but only wisdom can save your life.
21Ec 7:13 Accept the way God does things, for who can straighten what he has made crooked?
21Ec 7:14 Enjoy prosperity while you can, but when hard times strike, realize that both come from God. Remember that nothing is certain in this life.
21Ec 7:15 I have seen everything in this meaningless life, including the death of good young people and the long life of wicked people. 
21Ec 7:16 So don°Øt be too good or too wise! Why destroy yourself? 
21Ec 7:17 On the other hand, don°Øt be too wicked either. Don°Øt be a fool! Why die before your time? 
21Ec 7:18 Pay attention to these instructions, for anyone who fears God will avoid both extremes®Á. / ®ÁOr will follow them both
21Ec 7:19 One wise person is stronger than ten leading citizens of a town!
21Ec 7:20 Not a single person on earth is always good and never sins.
21Ec 7:21 Don°Øt eavesdrop on others - you may hear your servant curse you. 
21Ec 7:22 For you know how often you yourself have cursed others.
21Ec 7:23 I have always tried my best to let wisdom guide my thoughts and actions. I said to myself, °∞I am determined to be wise.°± But it didn°Øt work. 
21Ec 7:24 Wisdom is always distant and difficult to find. 
21Ec 7:25 I searched everywhere, determined to find wisdom and to understand the reason for things. I was determined to prove to myself that wickedness is stupid and that foolishness is madness.
21Ec 7:26 I discovered that a seductive woman®Á is a trap more bitter than death. Her passion is a snare, and her soft hands are chains. Those who are pleasing to God will escape her, but sinners will be caught in her snare. / ®ÁHebrew a woman
21Ec 7:27 °∞This is my conclusion,°± says the Teacher. °∞I discovered this after looking at the matter from every possible angle. 
21Ec 7:28 Though I have searched repeatedly, I have not found what I was looking for. Only one out of a thousand men is virtuous, but not one woman! 
21Ec 7:29 But I did find this£∫ God created people to be virtuous, but they have each turned to follow their own downward path.°±
21Ec 8:1 How wonderful to be wise, to analyze and interpret things. Wisdom lights up a person°Øs face, softening its harshness.
21Ec 8:2 Obey the king since you vowed to God that you would. 
21Ec 8:3 Don°Øt try to avoid doing your duty, and don°Øt stand with those who plot evil, for the king can do whatever he wants. 
21Ec 8:4 His command is backed by great power. No one can resist or question it. 
21Ec 8:5 Those who obey him will not be punished. Those who are wise will find a time and a way to do what is right, 
21Ec 8:6 for there is a time and a way for everything, even when a person is in trouble.
21Ec 8:7 Indeed, how can people avoid what they don°Øt know is going to happen? 
21Ec 8:8 None of us can hold back our spirit from departing. None of us has the power to prevent the day of our death. There is no escaping that obligation, that dark battle. And in the face of death, wickedness will certainly not rescue the wicked.
21Ec 8:9 I have thought deeply about all that goes on here under the sun, where people have the power to hurt each other. 
21Ec 8:10 I have seen wicked people buried with honor. Yet they were the very ones who frequented the Temple and are now praised®Á in the same city where they committed their crimes! This, too, is meaningless. / ®ÁAs in some Hebrew manuscripts and Greek version; many Hebrew manuscripts read and are forgotten
21Ec 8:11 When a crime is not punished quickly, people feel it is safe to do wrong. 
21Ec 8:12 But even though a person sins a hundred times and still lives a long time, I know that those who fear God will be better off. 
21Ec 8:13 The wicked will not prosper, for they do not fear God. Their days will never grow long like the evening shadows.
21Ec 8:14 And this is not all that is meaningless in our world. In this life, good people are often treated as though they were wicked, and wicked people are often treated as though they were good. This is so meaningless!
21Ec 8:15 So I recommend having fun, because there is nothing better for people in this world than to eat, drink, and enjoy life. That way they will experience some happiness along with all the hard work God gives them under the sun.
21Ec 8:16 In my search for wisdom and in my observation of people°Øs burdens here on earth, I discovered that there is ceaseless activity, day and night. 
21Ec 8:17 I realized that no one can discover everything God is doing under the sun. Not even the wisest people discover everything, no matter what they claim.
21Ec 9:1 This, too, I carefully explored£∫ Even though the actions of godly and wise people are in God°Øs hands, no one knows whether God will show them favor. 
21Ec 9:2 The same destiny ultimately awaits everyone, whether righteous or wicked, good or bad®Á, ceremonially clean or unclean, religious or irreligious. Good people receive the same treatment as sinners, and people who make promises to God are treated like people who don°Øt. / ®ÁAs in Greek and Syriac versions and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew lacks or bad
21Ec 9:3 It seems so tragic that everyone under the sun suffers the same fate. That is why people are not more careful to be good. Instead, they choose their own mad course, for they have no hope. There is nothing ahead but death anyway. 
21Ec 9:4 There is hope only for the living. As they say, °∞It°Øs better to be a live dog than a dead lion!°±
21Ec 9:5 The living at least know they will die, but the dead know nothing. They have no further reward, nor are they remembered. 
21Ec 9:6 Whatever they did in their lifetime - loving, hating, envying - is all long gone. They no longer play a part in anything here on earth. 
21Ec 9:7 So go ahead. Eat your food with joy, and drink your wine with a happy heart, for God approves of this! 
21Ec 9:8 Wear fine clothes, with a splash of cologne!
21Ec 9:9 Live happily with the woman you love through all the meaningless days of life that God has given you under the sun. The wife God gives you is your reward for all your earthly toil. 
21Ec 9:10 Whatever you do, do well. For when you go to the grave®Á, there will be no work or planning or knowledge or wisdom. / ®ÁHebrew to Sheol
21Ec 9:11 I have observed something else under the sun. The fastest runner doesn°Øt always win the race, and the strongest warrior doesn°Øt always win the battle. The wise sometimes go hungry, and the skillful are not necessarily wealthy. And those who are educated don°Øt always lead successful lives. It is all decided by chance, by being in the right place at the right time.
21Ec 9:12 People can never predict when hard times might come. Like fish in a net or birds in a trap, people are caught by sudden tragedy.
21Ec 9:13 Here is another bit of wisdom that has impressed me as I have watched the way our world works. 
21Ec 9:14 There was a small town with only a few people, and a great king came with his army and besieged it. 
21Ec 9:15 A poor, wise man knew how to save the town, and so it was rescued. But afterward no one thought to thank him. 
21Ec 9:16 So even though wisdom is better than strength, those who are wise will be despised if they are poor. What they say will not be appreciated for long.
21Ec 9:17 Better to hear the quiet words of a wise person than the shouts of a foolish king.
21Ec 9:18 Better to have wisdom than weapons of war, but one sinner can destroy much that is good.
21Ec 10:1 As dead flies cause even a bottle of perfume to stink, so a little foolishness spoils great wisdom and honor.
21Ec 10:2 A wise person chooses the right road; a fool takes the wrong one.
21Ec 10:3 You can identify fools just by the way they walk down the street!
21Ec 10:4 If your boss is angry at you, don°Øt quit! A quiet spirit can overcome even great mistakes.
21Ec 10:5 There is another evil I have seen under the sun. Kings and rulers make a grave mistake 
21Ec 10:6 when they give great authority to foolish people and low positions to people of proven worth. 
21Ec 10:7 I have even seen servants riding horseback like princes - and princes walking like servants!
21Ec 10:8 When you dig a well, you might fall in. When you demolish an old wall, you could be bitten by a snake.
21Ec 10:9 When you work in a quarry, stones might fall and crush you. When you chop wood, there is danger with each stroke of your ax.
21Ec 10:10 Using a dull ax requires great strength, so sharpen the blade. That°Øs the value of wisdom; it helps you succeed.
21Ec 10:11 If a snake bites before you charm it, what°Øs the use of being a snake charmer?
21Ec 10:12 Wise words bring approval, but fools are destroyed by their own words.
21Ec 10:13 Fools base their thoughts on foolish assumptions, so their conclusions will be wicked madness;
21Ec 10:14 they chatter on and on. No one really knows what is going to happen; no one can predict the future.
21Ec 10:15 Fools are so exhausted by a little work that they can°Øt even find their way home.
21Ec 10:16 What sorrow for the land ruled by a servant®Á, the land whose leaders feast in the morning. / ®ÁOr a child
21Ec 10:17 Happy is the land whose king is a noble leader and whose leaders feast at the proper time to gain strength for their work, not to get drunk.
21Ec 10:18 Laziness leads to a sagging roof; idleness leads to a leaky house.
21Ec 10:19 A party gives laughter, wine gives happiness, and money gives everything!
21Ec 10:20 Never make light of the king, even in your thoughts. And don°Øt make fun of the powerful, even in your own bedroom. For a little bird might deliver your message and tell them what you said.
21Ec 11:1 Send your grain across the seas, and in time, profits will flow back to you®Á. / ®ÁOr Give generously, or for your gifts will return to you later. Hebrew reads Throw your bread on the waters, or for after many days you will find it again
21Ec 11:2 But divide your investments among many places®Á, for you do not know what risks might lie ahead. / ®ÁHebrew among seven or even eight
21Ec 11:3 When clouds are heavy, the rains come down. Whether a tree falls north or south, it stays where it falls.
21Ec 11:4 Farmers who wait for perfect weather never plant. If they watch every cloud, they never harvest.
21Ec 11:5 Just as you cannot understand the path of the wind or the mystery of a tiny baby growing in its mother°Øs womb®Á, so you cannot understand the activity of God, who does all things. / ®ÁSome manuscripts read Just as you cannot understand how breath comes to a tiny baby in its mother°Øs womb
21Ec 11:6 Plant your seed in the morning and keep busy all afternoon, for you don°Øt know if profit will come from one activity or another - or maybe both.
21Ec 11:7 Light is sweet; how pleasant to see a new day dawning.
21Ec 11:8 When people live to be very old, let them rejoice in every day of life. But let them also remember there will be many dark days. Everything still to come is meaningless.
21Ec 11:9 Young people®Á, it°Øs wonderful to be young! Enjoy every minute of it. Do everything you want to do; take it all in. But remember that you must give an account to God for everything you do. / ®ÁHebrew Young man
21Ec 11:10 So refuse to worry, and keep your body healthy. But remember that youth, with a whole life before you, is meaningless.
21Ec 12:1 Don°Øt let the excitement of youth cause you to forget your Creator. Honor him in your youth before you grow old and say, °∞Life is not pleasant anymore.°± 
21Ec 12:2 Remember him before the light of the sun, moon, and stars is dim to your old eyes, and rain clouds continually darken your sky. 
21Ec 12:3 Remember him before your legs - the guards of your house - start to tremble; and before your shoulders - the strong men - stoop. Remember him before your teeth - your few remaining servants - stop grinding; and before your eyes - the women looking through the windows - see dimly.
21Ec 12:4 Remember him before the door to life°Øs opportunities is closed and the sound of work fades. Now you rise at the first chirping of the birds, but then all their sounds will grow faint.
21Ec 12:5 Remember him before you become fearful of falling and worry about danger in the streets; before your hair turns white like an almond tree in bloom, and you drag along without energy like a dying grasshopper, and the caperberry no longer inspires sexual desire. Remember him before you near the grave, your everlasting home, when the mourners will weep at your funeral.
21Ec 12:6 Yes, remember your Creator now while you are young, before the silver cord of life snaps and the golden bowl is broken. Don°Øt wait until the water jar is smashed at the spring and the pulley is broken at the well. 
21Ec 12:7 For then the dust will return to the earth, and the spirit will return to God who gave it.
21Ec 12:8 °∞Everything is meaningless,°± says the Teacher, °∞completely meaningless.°±
21Ec 12:9 Keep this in mind£∫ The Teacher was considered wise, and he taught the people everything he knew. He listened carefully to many proverbs, studying and classifying them. 
21Ec 12:10 The Teacher sought to find just the right words to express truths clearly®Á. / ®ÁOr sought to write what was upright and true
21Ec 12:11 The words of the wise are like cattle prods - painful but helpful. Their collected sayings are like a nail-studded stick with which a shepherd®Á drives the sheep. / ®ÁOr one shepherd
21Ec 12:12 But, my child®Á, let me give you some further advice£∫ Be careful, for writing books is endless, and much study wears you out. / ®ÁHebrew my son
21Ec 12:13 That°Øs the whole story. Here now is my final conclusion£∫ Fear God and obey his commands, for this is everyone°Øs duty. 
21Ec 12:14 God will judge us for everything we do, including every secret thing, whether good or bad.

22Sg 1:1 This is Solomon°Øs song of songs, more wonderful than any other.
22Sg 1:2 [Young Woman®Á] Kiss me and kiss me again, for your love is sweeter than wine. / ®ÁThe headings identifying the speakers are not in the original text, though the Hebrew usually gives clues by means of the gender of the person speaking
22Sg 1:3 How fragrant your cologne; your name is like its spreading fragrance. No wonder all the young women love you!
22Sg 1:4 Take me with you; come, let°Øs run! The king has brought me into his bedroom. [Young Women of Jerusalem] How happy we are for you, O king. We praise your love even more than wine. [Young Woman] How right they are to adore you.
22Sg 1:5 I am dark but beautiful, O women of Jerusalem - dark as the tents of Kedar, dark as the curtains of Solomon°Øs tents.
22Sg 1:6 Don°Øt stare at me because I am dark - the sun has darkened my skin. My brothers were angry with me; they forced me to care for their vineyards, so I couldn°Øt care for myself - my own vineyard.
22Sg 1:7 Tell me, my love, where are you leading your flock today? Where will you rest your sheep at noon? For why should I wander like a prostitute®Á among your friends and their flocks? / ®ÁHebrew like a veiled woman
22Sg 1:8 [Young Man] If you don°Øt know, O most beautiful woman, follow the trail of my flock, and graze your young goats by the shepherds°Ø tents.
22Sg 1:9 You are as exciting, my darling, as a mare among Pharaoh°Øs stallions.
22Sg 1:10 How lovely are your cheeks; your earrings set them afire! How lovely is your neck, enhanced by a string of jewels.
22Sg 1:11 We will make for you earrings of gold and beads of silver.
22Sg 1:12 [Young Woman] The king is lying on his couch, enchanted by the fragrance of my perfume.
22Sg 1:13 My lover is like a sachet of myrrh lying between my breasts.
22Sg 1:14 He is like a bouquet of sweet henna blossoms from the vineyards of En-gedi.
22Sg 1:15 [Young Man] How beautiful you are, my darling, how beautiful! Your eyes are like doves.
22Sg 1:16 [Young Woman] You are so handsome, my love, pleasing beyond words! The soft grass is our bed;
22Sg 1:17 fragrant cedar branches are the beams of our house, and pleasant smelling firs are the rafters.
22Sg 2:1 [Young Woman] I am the spring crocus blooming on the Sharon Plain®Á, the lily of the valley. / ®ÁTraditionally rendered I am the rose of Sharon. Sharon Plain is a region in the coastal plain of Palestine
22Sg 2:2 [Young Man] Like a lily among thistles is my darling among young women.
22Sg 2:3 [Young Woman] Like the finest apple tree in the orchard is my lover among other young men. I sit in his delightful shade and taste his delicious fruit.
22Sg 2:4 He escorts me to the banquet hall; it°Øs obvious how much he loves me.
22Sg 2:5 Strengthen me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, for I am weak with love.
22Sg 2:6 His left arm is under my head, and his right arm embraces me.
22Sg 2:7 Promise me, O women of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and wild deer, not to awaken love until the time is right®Á. / ®ÁOr not to awaken love until it is ready
22Sg 2:8 Ah, I hear my lover coming! He is leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills.
22Sg 2:9 My lover is like a swift gazelle or a young stag. Look, there he is behind the wall, looking through the window, peering into the room.
22Sg 2:10 My lover said to me, °∞Rise up, my darling! Come away with me, my fair one!
22Sg 2:11 Look, the winter is past, and the rains are over and gone.
22Sg 2:12 The flowers are springing up, the season of singing birds®Á has come, and the cooing of turtledoves fills the air. / ®ÁOr the season of pruning vines
22Sg 2:13 The fig trees are forming young fruit, and the fragrant grapevines are blossoming. Rise up, my darling! Come away with me, my fair one!°±
22Sg 2:14 [Young Man] My dove is hiding behind the rocks, behind an outcrop on the cliff. Let me see your face; let me hear your voice. For your voice is pleasant, and your face is lovely.Young Women of Jerusalem
22Sg 2:15 Catch all the foxes, those little foxes, before they ruin the vineyard of love, for the grapevines are blossoming!
22Sg 2:16 [Young Woman] My lover is mine, and I am his. He browses among the lilies.

22Sg 3:1 [Young Woman] One night as I lay in bed, I yearned for my lover. I yearned for him, but he did not come.

22Sg 3:3 The watchmen stopped me as they made their rounds, and I asked, °∞Have you seen the one I love?°±
22Sg 3:4 Then scarcely had I left them when I found my love! I caught and held him tightly, then I brought him to my mother°Øs house, into my mother°Øs bed, where I had been conceived.
22Sg 3:5 Promise me, O women of Jerusalem, by the gazelles and wild deer, not to awaken love until the time is right®Á. / ®ÁOr not to awaken love until it is ready
22Sg 3:6 [Young Women of Jerusalem] Who is this sweeping in from the wilderness like a cloud of smoke? Who is it, fragrant with myrrh and frankincense and every kind of spice?

22Sg 3:8 They are all skilled swordsmen, experienced warriors. Each wears a sword on his thigh, ready to defend the king against an attack in the night.
22Sg 3:9 King Solomon°Øs carriage is built of wood imported from Lebanon.
22Sg 3:10 Its posts are silver, its canopy gold; its cushions are purple. It was decorated with love by the young women of Jerusalem.
22Sg 3:11 [Young Woman] Come out to see King Solomon, young women of Jerusalem®Á. He wears the crown his mother gave him on his wedding day, his most joyous day. / ®ÁHebrew of Zion
22Sg 4:1 [Young Man] You are beautiful, my darling, beautiful beyond words. Your eyes are like doves behind your veil. Your hair falls in waves, like a flock of goats winding down the slopes of Gilead.

22Sg 4:7 You are altogether beautiful, my darling, beautiful in every way.

22Sg 5:3 But I responded, °∞I have taken off my robe. Should I get dressed again? I have washed my feet. Should I get them soiled?°±
22Sg 5:4 My lover tried to unlatch the door, and my heart thrilled within me.
22Sg 5:5 I jumped up to open the door for my love, and my hands dripped with perfume. My fingers dripped with lovely myrrh as I pulled back the bolt.
22Sg 5:6 I opened to my lover, but he was gone! My heart sank. I searched for him but could not find him anywhere. I called to him, but there was no reply.
22Sg 5:7 The night watchmen found me as they made their rounds. They beat and bruised me and stripped off my veil, those watchmen on the walls.
22Sg 5:8 Make this promise, O women of Jerusalem - If you find my lover, tell him I am weak with love.
22Sg 5:9 [Young Women of Jerusalem] Why is your lover better than all others, O woman of rare beauty? What makes your lover so special that we must promise this?
22Sg 5:10 [Young Woman] My lover is dark and dazzling, better than ten thousand others!
22Sg 5:11 His head is finest gold, his wavy hair is black as a raven.

22Sg 6:1 [Young Women of Jerusalem] Where has your lover gone, O woman of rare beauty? Which way did he turn so we can help you find him?
22Sg 6:2 [Young Woman] My lover has gone down to his garden, to his spice beds, to browse in the gardens and gather the lilies.
22Sg 6:3 I am my lover°Øs, and my lover is mine. He browses among the lilies.

22Sg 6:7 Your cheeks are like rosy pomegranates behind your veil.
22Sg 6:8 Even among sixty queens and eighty concubines and countless young women,
22Sg 6:9 I would still choose my dove, my perfect one - the favorite of her mother, dearly loved by the one who bore her. The young women see her and praise her; even queens and royal concubines sing her praises.
22Sg 6:10 °∞Who is this, arising like the dawn, as fair as the moon, as bright as the sun, as majestic as an army with billowing banners?°±
22Sg 6:11 I went down to the grove of walnut trees and out to the valley to see the new spring growth, to see whether the grapevines had budded or the pomegranates were in bloom.

22Sg 7:7 You are slender like a palm tree, and your breasts are like its clusters of fruit.
22Sg 7:8 I said, °∞I will climb the palm tree and take hold of its fruit.°± May your breasts be like grape clusters, and the fragrance of your breath like apples.
22Sg 7:9 May your kisses be as exciting as the best wine, flowing gently over lips and teeth®Á. / ®ÁAs in Greek and Syriac versions and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew reads over lips of sleepers

22Sg 8:4 Promise me, O women of Jerusalem, not to awaken love until the time is right®Á. / ®ÁOr not to awaken love until it is ready
22Sg 8:5 [Young Women of Jerusalem] Who is this sweeping in from the desert, leaning on her lover? [Young Woman] I aroused you under the apple tree, where your mother gave you birth, where in great pain she delivered you.

22Sg 8:7 Many waters cannot quench love, nor can rivers drown it. If a man tried to buy love with all his wealth, his offer would be utterly scorned.
22Sg 8:8 [The Young Woman°Øs Brothers] We have a little sister too young to have breasts. What will we do for our sister if someone asks to marry her?

23Is 5:3 Now, you people of Jerusalem and Judah, you judge between me and my vineyard.

23Is 5:22 What sorrow for those who are heroes at drinking wine and boast about all the alcohol they can hold.
23Is 5:23 They take bribes to let the wicked go free, and they punish the innocent.
23Is 5:24 Therefore, just as fire licks up stubble and dry grass shrivels in the flame, so their roots will rot and their flowers wither. For they have rejected the law of the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies; they have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 5:25 That is why the Lord°Øs anger burns against his people, and why he has raised his fist to crush them. The mountains tremble, and the corpses of his people litter the streets like garbage. But even then the Lord°Øs anger is not satisfied. His fist is still poised to strike!
23Is 5:26 He will send a signal to distant nations far away and whistle to those at the ends of the earth. They will come racing toward Jerusalem.
23Is 5:27 They will not get tired or stumble. They will not stop for rest or sleep. Not a belt will be loose, not a sandal strap broken.
23Is 5:28 Their arrows will be sharp and their bows ready for battle. Sparks will fly from their horses°Ø hooves, and the wheels of their chariots will spin like a whirlwind.
23Is 5:29 They will roar like lions, like the strongest of lions. Growling, they will pounce on their victims and carry them off, and no one will be there to rescue them.
23Is 5:30 They will roar over their victims on that day of destruction like the roaring of the sea. If someone looks across the land, only darkness and distress will be seen; even the light will be darkened by clouds.
23Is 6:1 It was in the year King Uzziah died®Á that I saw the Lord. He was sitting on a lofty throne, and the train of his robe filled the Temple. / ®ÁKing Uzziah died in 740 b.c.
23Is 6:2 Attending him were mighty seraphim, each having six wings. With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they flew. 
23Is 6:3 They were calling out to each other, °∞Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies! The whole earth is filled with his glory!°±
23Is 6:4 Their voices shook the Temple to its foundations, and the entire building was filled with smoke.
23Is 6:5 Then I said, °∞It°Øs all over! I am doomed, for I am a sinful man. I have filthy lips, and I live among a people with filthy lips. Yet I have seen the King, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.°±
23Is 6:6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a burning coal he had taken from the altar with a pair of tongs. 
23Is 6:7 He touched my lips with it and said, °∞See, this coal has touched your lips. Now your guilt is removed, and your sins are forgiven.°±
23Is 6:8 Then I heard the Lord asking, °∞Whom should I send as a messenger to this people? Who will go for us?°± I said, °∞Here I am. Send me.°±
23Is 6:9 And he said, °∞Yes, go, and say to this people, °ÆListen carefully, but do not understand. Watch closely, but learn nothing.°Ø
23Is 6:10 Harden the hearts of these people. Plug their ears and shut their eyes. That way, they will not see with their eyes, nor hear with their ears, nor understand with their hearts and turn to me for healing.°±®Á / ®ÁGreek version reads And he said, °∞Go and say to this people, °ÆWhen you hear what I say, you will not understand. When you see what I do, you will not comprehend.°Ø For the hearts of these people are hardened, and their ears cannot hear, and they have closed their eyes - so their eyes cannot see, and their ears cannot hear, and their hearts cannot understand, and they cannot turn to me and let me heal them.°± Compare Matt 13.14-15; Mark 4.12; Luke 8.10; Acts 28.26-27
23Is 6:11 Then I said, °∞Lord, how long will this go on?°± And he replied, °∞Until their towns are empty, their houses are deserted, and the whole country is a wasteland;
23Is 6:12 until the Lord has sent everyone away, and the entire land of Israel lies deserted.
23Is 6:13 If even a tenth - a remnant - survive, it will be invaded again and burned. But as a terebinth or oak tree leaves a stump when it is cut down, so Israel°Øs stump will be a holy seed.°±
23Is 7:1 When Ahaz, son of Jotham and grandson of Uzziah, was king of Judah, King Rezin of Syria®Á and Pekah son of Remaliah, the king of Israel, set out to attack Jerusalem. However, they were unable to carry out their plan. / ®ÁHebrew Aram; also in 7.2, 4, 5, 8
23Is 7:2 The news had come to the royal court of Judah£∫ °∞Syria is allied with Israel®Á against us!°± So the hearts of the king and his people trembled with fear, like trees shaking in a storm. / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel; also in 7.5, 8, 9, 17
23Is 7:3 Then the Lord said to Isaiah, °∞Take your son Shear-jashub®Á and go out to meet King Ahaz. You will find him at the end of the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool, near the road leading to the field where cloth is washed®Ë. / ®ÁShear-jashub means °∞A remnant will return.°± ®ËOr bleached
23Is 7:4 Tell him to stop worrying. Tell him he doesn°Øneed to fear the fierce anger of those two burned-out embers, King Rezin of Syria and Pekah son of Remaliah. 
23Is 7:5 Yes, the kings of Syria and Israel are plotting against him, saying, 
23Is 7:6 °ÆWe will attack Judah and capture it for ourselves. Then we will install the son of Tabeel as Judah°Øs king.°Ø 
23Is 7:7 But this is what the Sovereign Lord says. °∞This invasion will never happen; it will never take place;
23Is 7:8 for Syria is no stronger than its capital, Damascus, and Damascus is no stronger than its king, Rezin. As for Israel, within sixty-five years it will be crushed and completely destroyed.
23Is 7:9 Israel is no stronger than its capital, Samaria, and Samaria is no stronger than its king, Pekah son of Remaliah. Unless your faith is firm, I cannot make you stand firm.°±
23Is 7:10 Later, the Lord sent this message to King Ahaz£∫ 
23Is 7:11 °∞Ask the Lord your God for a sign of confirmation, Ahaz. Make it as difficult as you want - as high as heaven or as deep as the place of the dead®Á.°± / ®ÁHebrew as deep as Sheol
23Is 7:12 But the king refused. °∞No,°± he said, °∞I will not test the Lord like that.°±
23Is 7:13 Then Isaiah said, °∞Listen well, you royal family of David! Isn°Øt it enough to exhaust human patience? Must you exhaust the patience of my God as well? 
23Is 7:14 All right then, the Lord himself will give you the sign. Look! The virgin®Á will conceive a child! She will give birth to a son and will call him Immanuel (which means °ÆGod is with us°Ø). / ®ÁOr young woman
23Is 7:15 By the time this child is old enough to choose what is right and reject what is wrong, he will be eating yogurt®Á and honey. / ®ÁOr curds; also in 7.22
23Is 7:16 For before the child is that old, the lands of the two kings you fear so much will both be deserted.
23Is 7:17 °∞Then the Lord will bring things on you, your nation, and your family unlike anything since Israel broke away from Judah. He will bring the king of Assyria upon you!°±
23Is 7:18 In that day the Lord will whistle for the army of southern Egypt and for the army of Assyria. They will swarm around you like flies and bees. 
23Is 7:19 They will come in vast hordes and settle in the fertile areas and also in the desolate valleys, caves, and thorny places. 
23Is 7:20 In that day the Lord will hire a °∞razor°± from beyond the Euphrates River®Á - the king of Assyria - and use it to shave off everything£∫ your land, your crops, and your people®Ë. / ®ÁHebrew the river. ®ËHebrew shave off the head, the hair of the legs, and the beard
23Is 7:21 In that day a farmer will be fortunate to have a cow and two sheep or goats left. 
23Is 7:22 Nevertheless, there will be enough milk for everyone because so few people will be left in the land. They will eat their fill of yogurt and honey. 
23Is 7:23 In that day the lush vineyards, now worth 1,000 pieces of silver®Á, will become patches of briers and thorns. / ®ÁHebrew 1,000 shekels of silver, about 25 pounds or 11.4 kilograms in weight
23Is 7:24 The entire land will become a vast expanse of briers and thorns, a hunting ground overrun by wildlife. 
23Is 7:25 No one will go to the fertile hillsides where the gardens once grew, for briers and thorns will cover them. Cattle, sheep, and goats will graze there.
23Is 8:1 Then the Lord said to me, °∞Make a large signboard and clearly write this name on it£∫ Maher-shalal-hash-baz®Á.°± / ®ÁMaher-shalal-hash-baz means °∞Swift to plunder and quick to carry away.°±
23Is 8:2 I asked Uriah the priest and Zechariah son of Jeberekiah, both known as honest men, to witness my doing this.
23Is 8:3 Then I slept with my wife, and she became pregnant and gave birth to a son. And the Lord said, °∞Call him Maher-shalal-hash-baz. 
23Is 8:4 For before this child is old enough to say °ÆPapa°Ø or °ÆMama,°Ø the king of Assyria will carry away both the abundance of Damascus and the riches of Samaria.°±
23Is 8:5 Then the Lord spoke to me again and said, 
23Is 8:6 °∞My care for the people of Judah is like the gently flowing waters of Shiloah, but they have rejected it. They are rejoicing over what will happen to®Á King Rezin and King Pekah®Ë. / ®ÁOr They are rejoicing because of. ®ËHebrew and the son of Remaliah
23Is 8:7 Therefore, the Lord will overwhelm them with a mighty flood from the Euphrates River®Á - the king of Assyria and all his glory. This flood will overflow all its channels / ®ÁHebrew the river
23Is 8:8 and sweep into Judah until it is chin deep. It will spread its wings, submerging your land from one end to the other, O Immanuel.
23Is 8:9 °∞Huddle together, you nations, and be terrified. Listen, all you distant lands. Prepare for battle, but you will be crushed! Yes, prepare for battle, but you will be crushed!
23Is 8:10 Call your councils of war, but they will be worthless. Develop your strategies, but they will not succeed. For God is with us!®Á°± / ®ÁHebrew Immanuel!
23Is 8:11 The Lord has given me a strong warning not to think like everyone else does. He said,
23Is 8:12 °∞Don°Øt call everything a conspiracy, like they do, and don°Øt live in dread of what frightens them.
23Is 8:13 Make the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies holy in your life. He is the one you should fear. He is the one who should make you tremble.
23Is 8:14 He will keep you safe. But to Israel and Judah he will be a stone that makes people stumble, a rock that makes them fall. And for the people of Jerusalem he will be a trap and a snare.
23Is 8:15 Many will stumble and fall, never to rise again. They will be snared and captured.°±
23Is 8:16 Preserve the teaching of God; entrust his instructions to those who follow me.
23Is 8:17 I will wait for the Lord, who has turned away from the descendants of Jacob. I will put my hope in him.
23Is 8:18 I and the children the Lord has given me serve as signs and warnings to Israel from the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies who dwells in his Temple on Mount Zion.
23Is 8:19 Someone may say to you, °∞Let°Øs ask the mediums and those who consult the spirits of the dead. With their whisperings and mutterings, they will tell us what to do.°± But shouldn°Øt people ask God for guidance? Should the living seek guidance from the dead?
23Is 8:20 Look to God°Øs instructions and teachings! People who contradict his word are completely in the dark. 
23Is 8:21 They will go from one place to another, weary and hungry. And because they are hungry, they will rage and curse their king and their God. They will look up to heaven 
23Is 8:22 and down at the earth, but wherever they look, there will be trouble and anguish and dark despair. They will be thrown out into the darkness.
23Is 9:1 ®ÁNevertheless, that time of darkness and despair will not go on forever. The land of Zebulun and Naphtali will be humbled, but there will be a time in the future when Galilee of the Gentiles, which lies along the road that runs between the Jordan and the sea, will be filled with glory. / ®ÁVerse 9.1 is numbered 8.23 in Hebrew text
23Is 9:2 ®Á The people who walk in darkness will see a great light. For those who live in a land of deep darkness®Ë, a light will shine. / ®ÁVerses 9.2-21 are numbered 9.1-20 in Hebrew text, ®ËGreek version reads a land where death casts its shadow. Compare Matt 4.16
23Is 9:3 You will enlarge the nation of Israel, and its people will rejoice. They will rejoice before you as people rejoice at the harvest and like warriors dividing the plunder.
23Is 9:4 For you will break the yoke of their slavery and lift the heavy burden from their shoulders. You will break the oppressor°Øs rod, just as you did when you destroyed the army of Midian.
23Is 9:5 The boots of the warrior and the uniforms bloodstained by war will all be burned. They will be fuel for the fire.
23Is 9:6 For a child is born to us, a son is given to us. The government will rest on his shoulders. And he will be called. Wonderful Counselor®Á, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of Peace. / ®ÁOr Wonderful, Counselor
23Is 9:7 His government and its peace will never end. He will rule with fairness and justice from the throne of his ancestor David for all eternity. The passionate commitment of the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies will make this happen!
23Is 9:8 The Lord has spoken out against Jacob; his judgment has fallen upon Israel.
23Is 9:9 And the people of Israel®Á and Samaria, who spoke with such pride and arrogance, will soon know it. / ®ÁHebrew of Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel
23Is 9:10 They said, °∞We will replace the broken bricks of our ruins with finished stone, and replant the felled sycamore-fig trees with cedars.°±
23Is 9:11 But the Lord will bring Rezin°Øs enemies against Israel and stir up all their foes.
23Is 9:12 The Syrians®Á from the east and the Philistines from the west will bare their fangs and devour Israel. But even then the Lord°Øs anger will not be satisfied. His fist is still poised to strike. / ®ÁHebrew Arameans
23Is 9:13 For after all this punishment, the people will still not repent. They will not seek the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.
23Is 9:14 Therefore, in a single day the Lord will destroy both the head and the tail, the noble palm branch and the lowly reed.
23Is 9:15 The leaders of Israel are the head, and the lying prophets are the tail.
23Is 9:16 For the leaders of the people have misled them. They have led them down the path of destruction.
23Is 9:17 That is why the Lord takes no pleasure in the young men and shows no mercy even to the widows and orphans. For they are all wicked hypocrites, and they all speak foolishness. But even then the Lord°Øs anger will not be satisfied. His fist is still poised to strike.
23Is 9:18 This wickedness is like a brushfire. It burns not only briers and thorns but also sets the forests ablaze. Its burning sends up clouds of smoke.
23Is 9:19 The land will be blackened by the fury of the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. The people will be fuel for the fire, and no one will spare even his own brother.
23Is 9:20 They will attack their neighbor on the right but will still be hungry. They will devour their neighbor on the left but will not be satisfied. In the end they will even eat their own children®Á. / ®ÁOr at their own arms
23Is 9:21 Manasseh will feed on Ephraim, Ephraim will feed on Manasseh, and both will devour Judah. But even then the Lord°Øs anger will not be satisfied. His fist is still poised to strike.
23Is 10:1 What sorrow awaits the unjust judges and those who issue unfair laws.
23Is 10:2 They deprive the poor of justice and deny the rights of the needy among my people. They prey on widows and take advantage of orphans.
23Is 10:3 What will you do when I punish you, when I send disaster upon you from a distant land? To whom will you turn for help? Where will your treasures be safe?
23Is 10:4 You will stumble along as prisoners or lie among the dead. But even then the Lord°Øs anger will not be satisfied. His fist is still poised to strike.
23Is 10:5 °∞What sorrow awaits Assyria, the rod of my anger. I use it as a club to express my anger.
23Is 10:6 I am sending Assyria against a godless nation, against a people with whom I am angry. Assyria will plunder them, trampling them like dirt beneath its feet.
23Is 10:7 But the king of Assyria will not understand that he is my tool; his mind does not work that way. His plan is simply to destroy, to cut down nation after nation.
23Is 10:8 He will say, °ÆEach of my princes will soon be a king.
23Is 10:9 We destroyed Calno just as we did Carchemish. Hamath fell before us as Arpad did. And we destroyed Samaria just as we did Damascus.
23Is 10:10 Yes, we have finished off many a kingdom whose gods were greater than those in Jerusalem and Samaria.
23Is 10:11 So we will defeat Jerusalem and her gods, just as we destroyed Samaria with hers.°Ø°±
23Is 10:12 After the Lord has used the king of Assyria to accomplish his purposes on Mount Zion and in Jerusalem, he will turn against the king of Assyria and punish him - for he is proud and arrogant. 
23Is 10:13 He boasts, °∞By my own powerful arm I have done this. With my own shrewd wisdom I planned it. I have broken down the defenses of nations and carried off their treasures. I have knocked down their kings like a bull.
23Is 10:14 I have robbed their nests of riches and gathered up kingdoms as a farmer gathers eggs. No one can even flap a wing against me or utter a peep of protest.°±
23Is 10:15 But can the ax boast greater power than the person who uses it? Is the saw greater than the person who saws? Can a rod strike unless a hand moves it? Can a wooden cane walk by itself?
23Is 10:16 Therefore, the Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, will send a plague among Assyria°Øs proud troops, and a flaming fire will consume its glory.
23Is 10:17 The Lord, the Light of Israel, will be a fire; the Holy One will be a flame. He will devour the thorns and briers with fire, burning up the enemy in a single night.
23Is 10:18 The Lord will consume Assyria°Øs glory like a fire consumes a forest in a fruitful land; it will waste away like sick people in a plague.
23Is 10:19 Of all that glorious forest, only a few trees will survive - so few that a child could count them!
23Is 10:20 In that day the remnant left in Israel, the survivors in the house of Jacob, will no longer depend on allies who seek to destroy them. But they will faithfully trust the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 10:21 A remnant will return;®Á yes, the remnant of Jacob will return to the Mighty God. / ®ÁHebrew Shear-jashub; see 7.3; 8.18
23Is 10:22 But though the people of Israel are as numerous as the sand of the seashore, only a remnant of them will return. The Lord has rightly decided to destroy his people.
23Is 10:23 Yes, the Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, has already decided to destroy the entire land®Á. / ®ÁGreek version reads only a remnant of them will be saved. / For he will carry out his sentence quickly and with finality and righteousness; / for God will carry out his sentence upon all the world with finality. Compare Rom 9.27-28
23Is 10:24 So this is what the Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, says£∫ °∞O my people in Zion, do not be afraid of the Assyrians when they oppress you with rod and club as the Egyptians did long ago. 
23Is 10:25 In a little while my anger against you will end, and then my anger will rise up to destroy them.°± 
23Is 10:26 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies will lash them with his whip, as he did when Gideon triumphed over the Midianites at the rock of Oreb, or when the Lord°Øs staff was raised to drown the Egyptian army in the sea.
23Is 10:27 In that day the Lord will end the bondage of his people. He will break the yoke of slavery and lift it from their shoulders®Á. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads The yoke will be broken, for you have grown so fat
23Is 10:28 Look, the Assyrians are now at Aiath. They are passing through Migron and are storing their equipment at Micmash.
23Is 10:29 They are crossing the pass and are camping at Geba. Fear strikes the town of Ramah. All the people of Gibeah, the hometown of Saul, are running for their lives.
23Is 10:30 Scream in terror, you people of Gallim! Shout out a warning to Laishah. Oh, poor Anathoth!
23Is 10:31 There go the people of Madmenah, all fleeing. The citizens of Gebim are trying to hide.
23Is 10:32 The enemy stops at Nob for the rest of that day. He shakes his fist at beautiful Mount Zion, the mountain of Jerusalem.
23Is 10:33 But look! The Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, will chop down the mighty tree of Assyria with great power! He will cut down the proud. That lofty tree will be brought down.
23Is 10:34 He will cut down the forest trees with an ax. Lebanon will fall to the Mighty One®Á. / ®ÁOr with an ax / as even the mighty trees of Lebanon fall
23Is 11:1 Out of the stump of David°Øs family®Á will grow a shoot - yes, a new Branch bearing fruit from the old root. / ®ÁHebrew the stump of the line of Jesse. Jesse was King David°Øs father
23Is 11:2 And the Spirit of the Lord will rest on him - the Spirit of wisdom and understanding, the Spirit of counsel and might, the Spirit of knowledge and the fear of the Lord.
23Is 11:3 He will delight in obeying the Lord. He will not judge by appearance nor make a decision based on hearsay.
23Is 11:4 He will give justice to the poor and make fair decisions for the exploited. The earth will shake at the force of his word, and one breath from his mouth will destroy the wicked.
23Is 11:5 He will wear righteousness like a belt and truth like an undergarment.
23Is 11:6 In that day the wolf and the lamb will live together; the leopard will lie down with the baby goat. The calf and the yearling will be safe with the lion, and a little child will lead them all.
23Is 11:7 The cow will graze near the bear. The cub and the calf will lie down together. The lion will eat hay like a cow.
23Is 11:8 The baby will play safely near the hole of a cobra. Yes, a little child will put its hand in a nest of deadly snakes without harm.
23Is 11:9 Nothing will hurt or destroy in all my holy mountain, for as the waters fill the sea, so the earth will be filled with people who know the Lord.
23Is 11:10 In that day the heir to David°Øs throne®Á will be a banner of salvation to all the world. The nations will rally to him, and the land where he lives will be a glorious place®Ë. / ®ÁHebrew the root of Jesse. ®ËGreek version reads In that day the heir to David°Øs throne [literally the root of Jesse] will come, and he will rule over the Gentiles. They will place their hopes on him. Compare Rom 15.12
23Is 11:11 In that day the Lord will reach out his hand a second time to bring back the remnant of his people - those who remain in Assyria and northern Egypt; in southern Egypt, Ethiopia®Á, and Elam; in Babylonia®Ë, Hamath, and all the distant coastlands. / ®ÁHebrew in Pathros, Cush. ®ËHebrew in Shinar
23Is 11:12 He will raise a flag among the nations and assemble the exiles of Israel. He will gather the scattered people of Judah from the ends of the earth.
23Is 11:13 Then at last the jealousy between Israel®Á and Judah will end. They will not be rivals anymore. / ®ÁHebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel
23Is 11:14 They will join forces to swoop down on Philistia to the west. Together they will attack and plunder the nations to the east. They will occupy the lands of Edom and Moab, and Ammon will obey them.
23Is 11:15 The Lord will make a dry path through the gulf of the Red Sea®Á. He will wave his hand over the Euphrates River®Ë, sending a mighty wind to divide it into seven streams so it can easily be crossed on foot. / ®ÁHebrew will destroy the tongue of the sea of Egypt. ®Ë Hebrew the river
23Is 11:16 He will make a highway for the remnant of his people, the remnant coming from Assyria, just as he did for Israel long ago when they returned from Egypt.
23Is 12:1 In that day you will sing. °∞I will praise you, O Lord! You were angry with me, but not any more. Now you comfort me.
23Is 12:2 See, God has come to save me. I will trust in him and not be afraid. The Lord God is my strength and my song; he has given me victory.°±
23Is 12:3 With joy you will drink deeply from the fountain of salvation!
23Is 12:4 In that wonderful day you will sing. °∞Thank the Lord! Praise his name! Tell the nations what he has done. Let them know how mighty he is!
23Is 12:5 Sing to the Lord, for he has done wonderful things. Make known his praise around the world.
23Is 12:6 Let all the people of Jerusalem®Á shout his praise with joy! For great is the Holy One of Israel who lives among you.°± / ®ÁHebrew Zion
23Is 13:1 Isaiah son of Amoz received this message concerning the destruction of Babylon.
23Is 13:2 °∞Raise a signal flag on a bare hilltop. Call up an army against Babylon. Wave your hand to encourage them as they march into the palaces of the high and mighty.
23Is 13:3 I, the Lord, have dedicated these soldiers for this task. Yes, I have called mighty warriors to express my anger, and they will rejoice when I am exalted.°±
23Is 13:4 Hear the noise on the mountains! Listen, as the vast armies march! It is the noise and shouting of many nations. The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has called this army together.
23Is 13:5 They come from distant countries, from beyond the farthest horizons. They are the Lord°Øs weapons to carry out his anger. With them he will destroy the whole land.
23Is 13:6 Scream in terror, for the day of the Lord has arrived - the time for the Almighty to destroy.
23Is 13:7 Every arm is paralyzed with fear. Every heart melts, 
23Is 13:8 and people are terrified. Pangs of anguish grip them, like those of a woman in labor. They look helplessly at one another, their faces aflame with fear.
23Is 13:9 For see, the day of the Lord is coming - the terrible day of his fury and fierce anger. The land will be made desolate, and all the sinners destroyed with it.
23Is 13:10 The heavens will be black above them; the stars will give no light. The sun will be dark when it rises, and the moon will provide no light.
23Is 13:11 °∞I, the Lord, will punish the world for its evil and the wicked for their sin. I will crush the arrogance of the proud and humble the pride of the mighty.
23Is 13:12 I will make people scarcer than gold - more rare than the fine gold of Ophir.
23Is 13:13 For I will shake the heavens. The earth will move from its place when the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies displays his wrath in the day of his fierce anger.°±
23Is 13:14 Everyone in Babylon will run about like a hunted gazelle, like sheep without a shepherd. They will try to find their own people and flee to their own land.
23Is 13:15 Anyone who is captured will be cut down - run through with a sword.
23Is 13:16 Their little children will be dashed to death before their eyes. Their homes will be sacked, and their wives will be raped.
23Is 13:17 °∞Look, I will stir up the Medes against Babylon. They cannot be tempted by silver or bribed with gold.
23Is 13:18 The attacking armies will shoot down the young men with arrows. They will have no mercy on helpless babies and will show no compassion for children.°±
23Is 13:19 Babylon, the most glorious of kingdoms, the flower of Chaldean pride, will be devastated like Sodom and Gomorrah when God destroyed them.
23Is 13:20 Babylon will never be inhabited again. It will remain empty for generation after generation. Nomads will refuse to camp there, and shepherds will not bed down their sheep.
23Is 13:21 Desert animals will move into the ruined city, and the houses will be haunted by howling creatures. Owls will live among the ruins, and wild goats will go there to dance.
23Is 13:22 Hyenas will howl in its fortresses, and jackals will make dens in its luxurious palaces. Babylon°Øs days are numbered; its time of destruction will soon arrive.
23Is 14:1 But the Lord will have mercy on the descendants of Jacob. He will choose Israel as his special people once again. He will bring them back to settle once again in their own land. And people from many different nations will come and join them there and unite with the people of Israel®Á. / ®ÁHebrew the house of Jacob. The names °∞Jacob°± and °∞Israel°± are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation
23Is 14:2 The nations of the world will help the Lord°Øs people to return, and those who come to live in their land will serve them. Those who captured Israel will themselves be captured, and Israel will rule over its enemies.
23Is 14:3 In that wonderful day when the Lord gives his people rest from sorrow and fear, from slavery and chains, 
23Is 14:4 you will taunt the king of Babylon. You will say, °∞The mighty man has been destroyed. Yes, your insolence®Á is ended. / ®ÁAs in Dead Sea Scrolls; the meaning of the Masoretic Text is uncertain
23Is 14:5 For the Lord has crushed your wicked power and broken your evil rule.
23Is 14:6 You struck the people with endless blows of rage and held the nations in your angry grip with unrelenting tyranny.
23Is 14:7 But finally the earth is at rest and quiet. Now it can sing again!
23Is 14:8 Even the trees of the forest - the cypress trees and the cedars of Lebanon - sing out this joyous song. °ÆSince you have been cut down, no one will come now to cut us down!°Ø
23Is 14:9 °∞In the place of the dead®Á there is excitement over your arrival. The spirits of world leaders and mighty kings long dead stand up to see you. / ®ÁHebrew Sheol; also in 14.15
23Is 14:10 With one voice they all cry out, °ÆNow you are as weak as we are!
23Is 14:11 Your might and power were buried with you®Á. The sound of the harp in your palace has ceased. Now maggots are your sheet, and worms your blanket.°Ø / ®ÁHebrew were brought down to Sheol
23Is 14:12 °∞How you are fallen from heaven, O shining star, son of the morning! You have been thrown down to the earth, you who destroyed the nations of the world.

23Is 14:16 Everyone there will stare at you and ask, °ÆCan this be the one who shook the earth and made the kingdoms of the world tremble?
23Is 14:17 Is this the one who destroyed the world and made it into a wasteland? Is this the king who demolished the world°Øs greatest cities and had no mercy on his prisoners?°Ø
23Is 14:18 °∞The kings of the nations lie in stately glory, each in his own tomb,
23Is 14:19 but you will be thrown out of your grave like a worthless branch. Like a corpse trampled underfoot, you will be dumped into a mass grave with those killed in battle. You will descend to the pit.
23Is 14:20 You will not be given a proper burial, for you have destroyed your nation and slaughtered your people. The descendants of such an evil person will never again receive honor.
23Is 14:21 Kill this man°Øs children! Let them die because of their father°Øs sins! They must not rise and conquer the earth, filling the world with their cities.°±
23Is 14:22 This is what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies says. °∞I, myself, have risen against Babylon! I will destroy its children and its children°Øs children,°± says the Lord.
23Is 14:23 °∞I will make Babylon a desolate place of owls, filled with swamps and marshes. I will sweep the land with the broom of destruction. I, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, have spoken!°±
23Is 14:24 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has sworn this oath. °∞It will all happen as I have planned. It will be as I have decided.
23Is 14:25 I will break the Assyrians when they are in Israel; I will trample them on my mountains. My people will no longer be their slaves nor bow down under their heavy loads.
23Is 14:26 I have a plan for the whole earth, a hand of judgment upon all the nations.
23Is 14:27 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has spoken - who can change his plans? When his hand is raised, who can stop him?°±
23Is 14:28 This message came to me the year King Ahaz died.®Á / ®ÁKing Ahaz died in 715 b.c.
23Is 14:29 Do not rejoice, you Philistines, that the rod that struck you is broken - that the king who attacked you is dead. For from that snake a more poisonous snake will be born, a fiery serpent to destroy you!
23Is 14:30 I will feed the poor in my pasture; the needy will lie down in peace. But as for you, I will wipe you out with famine and destroy the few who remain.
23Is 14:31 Wail at the gates! Weep in the cities! Melt with fear, you Philistines! A powerful army comes like smoke from the north. Each soldier rushes forward eager to fight.
23Is 14:32 What should we tell the Philistine messengers? Tell them, °∞The Lord has built Jerusalem®Á; its walls will give refuge to his oppressed people.°± / ®ÁHebrew Zion
23Is 15:1 This message came to me concerning Moab. In one night the town of Ar will be leveled, and the city of Kir will be destroyed.
23Is 15:2 Your people will go to their temple in Dibon to mourn. They will go to their sacred shrines to weep. They will wail for the fate of Nebo and Medeba, shaving their heads in sorrow and cutting off their beards.
23Is 15:3 They will wear burlap as they wander the streets. From every home and public square will come the sound of wailing.
23Is 15:4 The people of Heshbon and Elealeh will cry out; their voices will be heard as far away as Jahaz! The bravest warriors of Moab will cry out in utter terror. They will be helpless with fear.
23Is 15:5 My heart weeps for Moab. Its people flee to Zoar and Eglath-shelishiyah. Weeping, they climb the road to Luhith. Their cries of distress can be heard all along the road to Horonaim.
23Is 15:6 Even the waters of Nimrim are dried up! The grassy banks are scorched. The tender plants are gone; nothing green remains.
23Is 15:7 The people grab their possessions and carry them across the Ravine of Willows.
23Is 15:8 A cry of distress echoes through the land of Moab from one end to the other - from Eglaim to Beer-elim.

23Is 16:4 Let our refugees stay among you. Hide them from our enemies until the terror is past.°± When oppression and destruction have ended and enemy raiders have disappeared,
23Is 16:5 then God will establish one of David°Øs descendants as king. He will rule with mercy and truth. He will always do what is just and be eager to do what is right.
23Is 16:6 We have heard about proud Moab - about its pride and arrogance and rage. But all that boasting has disappeared.
23Is 16:7 The entire land of Moab weeps. Yes, everyone in Moab mourns for the cakes of raisins from Kir-hareseth. They are all gone now.
23Is 16:8 The farms of Heshbon are abandoned; the vineyards at Sibmah are deserted. The rulers of the nations have broken down Moab - that beautiful grapevine. Its tendrils spread north as far as the town of Jazer and trailed eastward into the wilderness. Its shoots reached so far west that they crossed over the Dead Sea®Á. / ®ÁHebrew the sea
23Is 16:9 So now I weep for Jazer and the vineyards of Sibmah; my tears will flow for Heshbon and Elealeh. There are no more shouts of joy over your summer fruits and harvest.
23Is 16:10 Gone now is the gladness, gone the joy of harvest. There will be no singing in the vineyards, no more happy shouts, no treading of grapes in the winepresses. I have ended all their harvest joys.
23Is 16:11 My heart°Øs cry for Moab is like a lament on a harp. I am filled with anguish for Kir-hareseth®Á. / ®ÁHebrew Kir-heres, a variant spelling of Kir-hareseth
23Is 16:12 The people of Moab will worship at their pagan shrines, but it will do them no good. They will cry to the gods in their temples, but no one will be able to save them.
23Is 16:13 The Lord has already said these things about Moab in the past. 
23Is 16:14 But now the Lord says, °∞Within three years, counting each day®Á, the glory of Moab will be ended. From its great population, only a few of its people will be left alive.°± / ®ÁHebrew Within three years, as a servant bound by contract would count them
23Is 17:1 This message came to me concerning Damascus£∫ °∞Look, the city of Damascus will disappear! It will become a heap of ruins.
23Is 17:2 The towns of Aroer will be deserted. Flocks will graze in the streets and lie down undisturbed, with no one to chase them away.

All that remains of Syria®Ë will share the fate of Israel°Øs departed glory,°± declares the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. / ®ÁHebrew of Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel. ®ËHebrew Aram

23Is 17:5 The whole land will look like a grainfield after the harvesters have gathered the grain. It will be desolate, like the fields in the valley of Rephaim after the harvest.
23Is 17:6 Only a few of its people will be left, like stray olives left on a tree after the harvest. Only two or three remain in the highest branches, four or five scattered here and there on the limbs,°± declares the Lord, the God of Israel.
23Is 17:7 Then at last the people will look to their Creator and turn their eyes to the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 17:8 They will no longer look to their idols for help or worship what their own hands have made. They will never again bow down to their Asherah poles or worship at the pagan shrines they have built.
23Is 17:9 Their largest cities will be like a deserted forest, like the land the Hivites and Amorites abandoned®Á when the Israelites came here so long ago. It will be utterly desolate. / ®ÁAs in Greek version; Hebrew reads like places of the wood and the highest bough
23Is 17:10 Why? Because you have turned from the God who can save you. You have forgotten the Rock who can hide you. So you may plant the finest grapevines and import the most expensive seedlings.
23Is 17:11 They may sprout on the day you set them out; yes, they may blossom on the very morning you plant them, but you will never pick any grapes from them. Your only harvest will be a load of grief and unrelieved pain.
23Is 17:12 Listen! The armies of many nations roar like the roaring of the sea. Hear the thunder of the mighty forces as they rush forward like thundering waves.
23Is 17:13 But though they thunder like breakers on a beach, God will silence them, and they will run away. They will flee like chaff scattered by the wind, like a tumbleweed whirling before a storm.
23Is 17:14 In the evening Israel waits in terror, but by dawn its enemies are dead. This is the just reward of those who plunder us, a fitting end for those who destroy us.

23Is 18:3 All you people of the world, everyone who lives on the earth - when I raise my battle flag on the mountain, look! When I blow the ram°Øs horn, listen!
23Is 18:4 For the Lord has told me this. °∞I will watch quietly from my dwelling place - as quietly as the heat rises on a summer day, or as the morning dew forms during the harvest.°±
23Is 18:5 Even before you begin your attack, while your plans are ripening like grapes, the Lord will cut off your new growth with pruning shears. He will snip off and discard your spreading branches.
23Is 18:6 Your mighty army will be left dead in the fields for the mountain vultures and wild animals. The vultures will tear at the corpses all summer. The wild animals will gnaw at the bones all winter.
23Is 18:7 At that time the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies will receive gifts from this land divided by rivers, from this tall, smooth-skinned people, who are feared far and wide for their conquests and destruction. They will bring the gifts to Jerusalem®Á, where the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies dwells. / ®ÁHebrew to Mount Zion
23Is 19:1 This message came to me concerning Egypt. Look! The Lord is advancing against Egypt, riding on a swift cloud. The idols of Egypt tremble. The hearts of the Egyptians melt with fear.
23Is 19:2 °∞I will make Egyptian fight against Egyptian - brother against brother, neighbor against neighbor, city against city, province against province.
23Is 19:3 The Egyptians will lose heart, and I will confuse their plans. They will plead with their idols for wisdom and call on spirits, mediums, and those who consult the spirits of the dead.

23Is 19:9 There will be no flax for the harvesters, no thread for the weavers.
23Is 19:10 They will be in despair, and all the workers will be sick at heart.
23Is 19:11 What fools are the officials of Zoan! Their best counsel to the king of Egypt is stupid and wrong. Will they still boast to Pharaoh of their wisdom? Will they dare brag about all their wise ancestors?
23Is 19:12 Where are your wise counselors, Pharaoh? Let them tell you what God plans, what the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies is going to do to Egypt.
23Is 19:13 The officials of Zoan are fools, and the officials of Memphis®Á are deluded. The leaders of the people have led Egypt astray. / ®ÁHebrew Noph
23Is 19:14 The Lord has sent a spirit of foolishness on them, so all their suggestions are wrong. They cause Egypt to stagger like a drunk in his vomit.
23Is 19:15 There is nothing Egypt can do. All are helpless - the head and the tail, the noble palm branch and the lowly reed.
23Is 19:16 In that day the Egyptians will be as weak as women. They will cower in fear beneath the upraised fist of the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. 
23Is 19:17 Just to speak the name of Israel will terrorize them, for the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has laid out his plans against them.
23Is 19:18 In that day five of Egypt°Øs cities will follow the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies. They will even begin to speak Hebrew, the language of Canaan. One of these cities will be Heliopolis, the City of the Sun®Á. / ®ÁOr will be the City of Destruction
23Is 19:19 In that day there will be an altar to the Lord in the heart of Egypt, and there will be a monument to the Lord at its border. 
23Is 19:20 It will be a sign and a witness that the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies is worshiped in the land of Egypt. When the people cry to the Lord for help against those who oppress them, he will send them a savior who will rescue them. 
23Is 19:21 The Lord will make himself known to the Egyptians. Yes, they will know the Lord and will give their sacrifices and offerings to him. They will make a vow to the Lord and will keep it. 
23Is 19:22 The Lord will strike Egypt, and then he will bring healing. For the Egyptians will turn to the Lord, and he will listen to their pleas and heal them.
23Is 19:23 In that day Egypt and Assyria will be connected by a highway. The Egyptians and Assyrians will move freely between their lands, and they will both worship God. 
23Is 19:24 And Israel will be their ally. The three will be together, and Israel will be a blessing to them. 
23Is 19:25 For the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies will say, °∞Blessed be Egypt, my people. Blessed be Assyria, the land I have made. Blessed be Israel, my special possession!°±

23Is 20:4 For the king of Assyria will take away the Egyptians and Ethiopians®Á as prisoners. He will make them walk naked and barefoot, both young and old, their buttocks bared, to the shame of Egypt. / ®ÁHebrew Cushites
23Is 20:5 Then the Philistines will be thrown into panic, for they counted on the power of Ethiopia and boasted of their allies in Egypt! 
23Is 20:6 They will say, °ÆIf this can happen to Egypt, what chance do we have? We were counting on Egypt to protect us from the king of Assyria.°Ø°±
23Is 21:1 This message came to me concerning Babylon - the desert by the sea®Á. Disaster is roaring down on you from the desert, like a whirlwind sweeping in from the Negev. / ®ÁHebrew concerning the desert by the sea
23Is 21:2 I see a terrifying vision. I see the betrayer betraying, the destroyer destroying. Go ahead, you Elamites and Medes, attack and lay siege. I will make an end to all the groaning Babylon caused.
23Is 21:3 My stomach aches and burns with pain. Sharp pangs of anguish are upon me, like those of a woman in labor. I grow faint when I hear what God is planning; I am too afraid to look.
23Is 21:4 My mind reels and my heart races. I longed for evening to come, but now I am terrified of the dark.
23Is 21:5 Look! They are preparing a great feast. They are spreading rugs for people to sit on. Everyone is eating and drinking. But quick! Grab your shields and prepare for battle. You are being attacked!

23Is 21:7 He should look for chariots drawn by pairs of horses, and for riders on donkeys and camels. Let the watchman be fully alert.°±
23Is 21:8 Then the watchman®Á called out, °∞Day after day I have stood on the watchtower, my lord. Night after night I have remained at my post. / ®ÁAs in Dead Sea Scrolls and Syriac version; Masoretic Text reads a lion

23Is 21:10 O my people, threshed and winnowed, I have told you everything the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has said, everything the God of Israel has told me.
23Is 21:11 This message came to me concerning Edom®Á. Someone from Edom®Ë keeps calling to me, °∞Watchman, how much longer until morning? When will the night be over?°± / ®ÁHebrew Dumah, which means °∞silence°± or °∞stillness.°± It is a wordplay on the word Edom. ®ËHebrew Seir, another name for Edom

23Is 21:13 This message came to me concerning Arabia. O caravans from Dedan, hide in the deserts of Arabia.
23Is 21:14 O people of Tema, bring water to these thirsty people, food to these weary refugees.
23Is 21:15 They have fled from the sword, from the drawn sword, from the bent bow and the terrors of battle.
23Is 21:16 The Lord said to me, °∞Within a year, counting each day®Á, all the glory of Kedar will come to an end. / ®ÁHebrew Within a year, as a servant bound by contract would count it. Some ancient manuscripts read Within three years, as in 16.14
23Is 21:17 Only a few of its courageous archers will survive. I, the Lord, the God of Israel, have spoken!°±
23Is 22:1 This message came to me concerning Jerusalem - the Valley of Vision®Á. What is happening? Why is everyone running to the rooftops? / ®ÁHebrew concerning the Valley of Vision
23Is 22:2 The whole city is in a terrible uproar. What do I see in this reveling city? Bodies are lying everywhere, killed not in battle but by famine and disease.
23Is 22:3 All your leaders have fled. They surrendered without resistance. The people tried to slip away, but they were captured, too.
23Is 22:4 That°Øs why I said, °∞Leave me alone to weep; do not try to comfort me. Let me cry for my people as I watch them being destroyed.°±
23Is 22:5 Oh, what a day of crushing defeat! What a day of confusion and terror brought by the Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, upon the Valley of Vision! The walls of Jerusalem have been broken, and cries of death echo from the mountainsides.
23Is 22:6 Elamites are the archers, with their chariots and charioteers. The men of Kir hold up the shields.

23Is 22:10 You survey the houses and tear some down for stone to strengthen the walls.
23Is 22:11 Between the city walls, you build a reservoir for water from the old pool. But you never ask for help from the One who did all this. You never considered the One who planned this long ago.
23Is 22:12 At that time the Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, called you to weep and mourn. He told you to shave your heads in sorrow for your sins and to wear clothes of burlap to show your remorse.
23Is 22:13 But instead, you dance and play; you slaughter cattle and kill sheep. You feast on meat and drink wine. You say, °∞Let°Øs feast and drink, for tomorrow we die!°±
23Is 22:14 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has revealed this to me£∫ °∞Till the day you die, you will never be forgiven for this sin.°± That is the judgment of the Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies.

23Is 22:22 I will give him the key to the house of David - the highest position in the royal court. When he opens doors, no one will be able to close them; when he closes doors, no one will be able to open them. 
23Is 22:23 He will bring honor to his family name, for I will drive him firmly in place like a nail in the wall. 
23Is 22:24 They will give him great responsibility, and he will bring honor to even the lowliest members of his family®Á.°± / ®ÁHebrew They will hang on him all the glory of his father°Øs house£∫ its offspring and offshoots, all its lesser vessels, from the bowls to all the jars

23Is 23:2 Mourn in silence, you people of the coast and you merchants of Sidon. Your traders crossed the sea,
23Is 23:3 sailing over deep waters. They brought you grain from Egypt®Á and harvests from along the Nile. You were the marketplace of the world. / ®ÁHebrew from Shihor, a branch of the Nile River
23Is 23:4 But now you are put to shame, city of Sidon, for Tyre, the fortress of the sea, says, °∞Now I am childless; I have no sons or daughters.°±
23Is 23:5 When Egypt hears the news about Tyre, there will be great sorrow.
23Is 23:6 Send word now to Tarshish! Wail, you people who live in distant lands!
23Is 23:7 Is this silent ruin all that is left of your once joyous city? What a long history was yours! Think of all the colonists you sent to distant places.
23Is 23:8 Who has brought this disaster on Tyre, that great creator of kingdoms? Her traders were all princes, her merchants were nobles.
23Is 23:9 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies has done it to destroy your pride and bring low all earth°Øs nobility.

23Is 23:13 Look at the land of Babylonia®Á - the people of that land are gone! The Assyrians have handed Babylon over to the wild animals of the desert. They have built siege ramps against its walls, torn down its palaces, and turned it to a heap of rubble. / ®ÁOr Chaldea
23Is 23:14 Wail, O ships of Tarshish, for your harbor is destroyed!
23Is 23:15 For seventy years, the length of a king°Øs life, Tyre will be forgotten. But then the city will come back to life as in the song about the prostitute.
23Is 23:16 Take a harp and walk the streets, you forgotten harlot. Make sweet melody and sing your songs so you will be remembered again.
23Is 23:17 Yes, after seventy years the Lord will revive Tyre. But she will be no different than she was before. She will again be a prostitute to all kingdoms around the world. 
23Is 23:18 But in the end her profits will be given to the Lord. Her wealth will not be hoarded but will provide good food and fine clothing for the Lord°Øs priests.
23Is 24:1 Look! The Lord is about to destroy the earth and make it a vast wasteland. He devastates the surface of the earth and scatters the people.
23Is 24:2 Priests and laypeople, servants and masters, maids and mistresses, buyers and sellers, lenders and borrowers, bankers and debtors - none will be spared.
23Is 24:3 The earth will be completely emptied and looted. The Lord has spoken!
23Is 24:4 The earth mourns and dries up, and the crops waste away and wither. Even the greatest people on earth waste away.
23Is 24:5 The earth suffers for the sins of its people, for they have twisted God°Øs instructions, violated his laws, and broken his everlasting covenant.
23Is 24:6 Therefore, a curse consumes the earth. Its people must pay the price for their sin. They are destroyed by fire, and only a few are left alive.
23Is 24:7 The grapevines waste away, and there is no new wine. All the merrymakers sigh and mourn.
23Is 24:8 The cheerful sound of tambourines is stilled; the happy cries of celebration are heard no more. The melodious chords of the harp are silent.
23Is 24:9 Gone are the joys of wine and song; alcoholic drink turns bitter in the mouth.
23Is 24:10 The city writhes in chaos; every home is locked to keep out intruders.
23Is 24:11 Mobs gather in the streets, crying out for wine. Joy has turned to gloom. Gladness has been banished from the land.
23Is 24:12 The city is left in ruins, its gates battered down.
23Is 24:13 Throughout the earth the story is the same - only a remnant is left, like the stray olives left on the tree or the few grapes left on the vine after harvest.
23Is 24:14 But all who are left shout and sing for joy. Those in the west praise the Lord°Øs majesty.
23Is 24:15 In eastern lands, give glory to the Lord. In the lands beyond the sea, praise the name of the Lord, the God of Israel.
23Is 24:16 We hear songs of praise from the ends of the earth, songs that give glory to the Righteous One! But my heart is heavy with grief. Weep for me, for I wither away. Deceit still prevails, and treachery is everywhere.
23Is 24:17 Terror and traps and snares will be your lot, you people of the earth.
23Is 24:18 Those who flee in terror will fall into a trap, and those who escape the trap will be caught in a snare. Destruction falls like rain from the heavens; the foundations of the earth shake.
23Is 24:19 The earth has broken up. It has utterly collapsed; it is violently shaken.
23Is 24:20 The earth staggers like a drunk. It trembles like a tent in a storm. It falls and will not rise again, for the guilt of its rebellion is very heavy.
23Is 24:21 In that day the Lord will punish the gods in the heavens and the proud rulers of the nations on earth.
23Is 24:22 They will be rounded up and put in prison. They will be shut up in prison and will finally be punished.
23Is 24:23 Then the glory of the moon will wane, and the brightness of the sun will fade, for the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies will rule on Mount Zion. He will rule in great glory in Jerusalem, in the sight of all the leaders of his people.
23Is 25:1 O Lord, I will honor and praise your name, for you are my God. You do such wonderful things! You planned them long ago, and now you have accomplished them.
23Is 25:2 You turn mighty cities into heaps of ruins. Cities with strong walls are turned to rubble. Beautiful palaces in distant lands disappear and will never be rebuilt.
23Is 25:3 Therefore, strong nations will declare your glory; ruthless nations will fear you.
23Is 25:4 But you are a tower of refuge to the poor, O Lord, a tower of refuge to the needy in distress. You are a refuge from the storm and a shelter from the heat. For the oppressive acts of ruthless people are like a storm beating against a wall,
23Is 25:5 or like the relentless heat of the desert. But you silence the roar of foreign nations. As the shade of a cloud cools relentless heat, so the boastful songs of ruthless people are stilled.
23Is 25:6 In Jerusalem®Á, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies will spread a wonderful feast for all the people of the world. It will be a delicious banquet with clear, well-aged wine and choice meat. / ®ÁHebrew On this mountain; also in 25.10
23Is 25:7 There he will remove the cloud of gloom, the shadow of death that hangs over the earth.
23Is 25:8 He will swallow up death forever!®Á The Sovereign Lord will wipe away all tears. He will remove forever all insults and mockery against his land and people. The Lord has spoken! / ®ÁGreek version reads Death is swallowed up in victory. Compare 1 Cor 15.54
23Is 25:9 In that day the people will proclaim, °∞This is our God! We trusted in him, and he saved us! This is the Lord, in whom we trusted. Let us rejoice in the salvation he brings!°±
23Is 25:10 For the Lord°Øs hand of blessing will rest on Jerusalem. But Moab will be crushed. It will be like straw trampled down and left to rot.
23Is 25:11 God will push down Moab°Øs people as a swimmer pushes down water with his hands. He will end their pride and all their evil works.
23Is 25:12 The high walls of Moab will be demolished. They will be brought down to the ground, down into the dust.
23Is 26:1 In that day, everyone in the land of Judah will sing this song. Our city is strong! We are surrounded by the walls of God°Øs salvation.
23Is 26:2 Open the gates to all who are righteous; allow the faithful to enter.
23Is 26:3 You will keep in perfect peace all who trust in you, all whose thoughts are fixed on you!
23Is 26:4 Trust in the Lord always, for the Lord God is the eternal Rock.
23Is 26:5 He humbles the proud and brings down the arrogant city. He brings it down to the dust.
23Is 26:6 The poor and oppressed trample it underfoot, and the needy walk all over it.
23Is 26:7 But for those who are righteous, the way is not steep and rough. You are a God who does what is right, and you smooth out the path ahead of them.
23Is 26:8 Lord, we show our trust in you by obeying your laws; our heart°Øs desire is to glorify your name.
23Is 26:9 All night long I search for you; in the morning I earnestly seek for God. For only when you come to judge the earth will people learn what is right.
23Is 26:10 Your kindness to the wicked does not make them do good. Although others do right, the wicked keep doing wrong and take no notice of the Lord°Øs majesty.
23Is 26:11 O Lord, they pay no attention to your upraised fist. Show them your eagerness to defend your people. Then they will be ashamed. Let your fire consume your enemies.
23Is 26:12 Lord, you will grant us peace; all we have accomplished is really from you.
23Is 26:13 O Lord our God, others have ruled us, but you alone are the one we worship.
23Is 26:14 Those we served before are dead and gone. Their departed spirits will never return! You attacked them and destroyed them, and they are long forgotten.
23Is 26:15 O Lord, you have made our nation great; yes, you have made us great. You have extended our borders, and we give you the glory!
23Is 26:16 Lord, in distress we searched for you. We prayed beneath the burden of your discipline.
23Is 26:17 Just as a pregnant woman writhes and cries out in pain as she gives birth, so were we in your presence, Lord.
23Is 26:18 We, too, writhe in agony, but nothing comes of our suffering. We have not given salvation to the earth, nor brought life into the world.
23Is 26:19 But those who die in the Lord will live; their bodies will rise again! Those who sleep in the earth will rise up and sing for joy! For your life-giving light will fall like dew on your people in the place of the dead!
23Is 26:20 Go home, my people, and lock your doors! Hide yourselves for a little while until the Lord°Øs anger has passed.
23Is 26:21 Look! The Lord is coming from heaven to punish the people of the earth for their sins. The earth will no longer hide those who have been killed. They will be brought out for all to see.
23Is 27:1 In that day the Lord will take his terrible, swift sword and punish Leviathan®Á, the swiftly moving serpent, the coiling, writhing serpent. He will kill the dragon of the sea. / ®ÁThe identification of Leviathan is disputed, ranging from an earthly creature to a mythical sea monster in ancient literature
23Is 27:2 °∞In that day, sing about the fruitful vineyard.
23Is 27:3 I, the Lord, will watch over it, watering it carefully. Day and night I will watch so no one can harm it.
23Is 27:4 My anger will be gone. If I find briers and thorns growing, I will attack them; I will burn them up - 
23Is 27:5 unless they turn to me for help. Let them make peace with me; yes, let them make peace with me.°±
23Is 27:6 The time is coming when Jacob°Øs descendants will take root. Israel will bud and blossom and fill the whole earth with fruit!
23Is 27:7 Has the Lord struck Israel as he struck her enemies? Has he punished her as he punished them?
23Is 27:8 No, but he exiled Israel to call her to account. She was exiled from her land as though blown away in a storm from the east.
23Is 27:9 The Lord did this to purge Israel°Øs®Á wickedness, to take away all her sin. As a result, all the pagan altars will be crushed to dust. No Asherah pole or pagan shrine will be left standing. / ®ÁHebrew Jacob°Øs. See note on 14.1
23Is 27:10 The fortified towns will be silent and empty, the houses abandoned, the streets overgrown with weeds. Calves will graze there, chewing on twigs and branches.
23Is 27:11 The people are like the dead branches of a tree, broken off and used for kindling beneath the cooking pots. Israel is a foolish and stupid nation, for its people have turned away from God. Therefore, the one who made them will show them no pity or mercy.
23Is 27:12 Yet the time will come when the Lord will gather them together like handpicked grain. One by one he will gather them - from the Euphrates River®Á in the east to the Brook of Egypt in the west. / ®ÁHebrew the river
23Is 27:13 In that day the great trumpet will sound. Many who were dying in exile in Assyria and Egypt will return to Jerusalem to worship the Lord on his holy mountain.
23Is 28:1 What sorrow awaits the proud city of Samaria - the glorious crown of the drunks of Israel®Á. It sits at the head of a fertile valley, but its glorious beauty will fade like a flower. It is the pride of a people brought down by wine. / ®ÁHebrew What sorrow awaits the crowning glory of the drunks of Ephraim, referring to Samaria, capital of the northern kingdom of Israel
23Is 28:2 For the Lord will send a mighty army against it. Like a mighty hailstorm and a torrential rain, they will burst upon it like a surging flood and smash it to the ground.
23Is 28:3 The proud city of Samaria - the glorious crown of the drunks of Israel®Á - will be trampled beneath its enemies°Ø feet. / ®ÁHebrew The crowning glory of the drunks of Ephraim; see note on 28.1
23Is 28:4 It sits at the head of a fertile valley, but its glorious beauty will fade like a flower. Whoever sees it will snatch it up, as an early fig is quickly picked and eaten.
23Is 28:5 Then at last the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies will himself be Israel°Øs glorious crown. He will be the pride and joy of the remnant of his people.
23Is 28:6 He will give a longing for justice to their judges. He will give great courage to their warriors who stand at the gates.
23Is 28:7 Now, however, Israel is led by drunks who reel with wine and stagger with alcohol. The priests and prophets stagger with alcohol and lose themselves in wine. They reel when they see visions and stagger as they render decisions.
23Is 28:8 Their tables are covered with vomit; filth is everywhere.
23Is 28:9 °∞Who does the Lord think we are?°± they ask. °∞Why does he speak to us like this? Are we little children, just recently weaned?
23Is 28:10 He tells us everything over and over - one line at a time, one line at a time, a little here, and a little there!°±
23Is 28:11 So now God will have to speak to his people through foreign oppressors who speak a strange language!
23Is 28:12 God has told his people, °∞Here is a place of rest; let the weary rest here. This is a place of quiet rest.°± But they would not listen.
23Is 28:13 So the Lord will spell out his message for them again, one line at a time, one line at a time, a little here, and a little there, so that they will stumble and fall. They will be injured, trapped, and captured.
23Is 28:14 Therefore, listen to this message from the Lord, you scoffing rulers in Jerusalem.
23Is 28:15 You boast, °∞We have struck a bargain to cheat death and have made a deal to dodge the grave®Á. The coming destruction can never touch us, for we have built a strong refuge made of lies and deception.°± / ®ÁHebrew Sheol; also in 28.18
23Is 28:16 Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says. °∞Look! I am placing a foundation stone in Jerusalem®Á, a firm and tested stone. It is a precious cornerstone that is safe to build on. Whoever believes need never be shaken®Ë. / ®ÁHebrew in Zion ®ËGreek version reads Look! I am placing a stone in the foundation of Jerusalem [literally Zion], a precious cornerstone for its foundation, chosen for great honor. Anyone who trusts in him will never be disgraced. Compare Rom 9.33; 1 Pet 2.6
23Is 28:17 I will test you with the measuring line of justice and the plumb line of righteousness. Since your refuge is made of lies, a hailstorm will knock it down. Since it is made of deception, a flood will sweep it away.
23Is 28:18 I will cancel the bargain you made to cheat death, and I will overturn your deal to dodge the grave. When the terrible enemy sweeps through, you will be trampled into the ground.
23Is 28:19 Again and again that flood will come, morning after morning, day and night, until you are carried away.°± This message will bring terror to your people.
23Is 28:20 The bed you have made is too short to lie on. The blankets are too narrow to cover you.
23Is 28:21 The Lord will come as he did against the Philistines at Mount Perazim and against the Amorites at Gibeon. He will come to do a strange thing; he will come to do an unusual deed.
23Is 28:22 For the Lord, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, has plainly said that he is determined to crush the whole land. So scoff no more, or your punishment will be even greater.
23Is 28:23 Listen to me; listen, and pay close attention.
23Is 28:24 Does a farmer always plow and never sow? Is he forever cultivating the soil and never planting?
23Is 28:25 Does he not finally plant his seeds - black cumin, cumin, wheat, barley, and emmer wheat - each in its proper way, and each in its proper place?
23Is 28:26 The farmer knows just what to do, for God has given him understanding.
23Is 28:27 A heavy sledge is never used to thresh black cumin; rather, it is beaten with a light stick. A threshing wheel is never rolled on cumin; instead, it is beaten lightly with a flail.
23Is 28:28 Grain for bread is easily crushed, so he doesn°Øt keep on pounding it. He threshes it under the wheels of a cart, but he doesn°Øt pulverize it.
23Is 28:29 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies is a wonderful teacher, and he gives the farmer great wisdom.
23Is 29:1 °∞What sorrow awaits Ariel®Á, the City of David. Year after year you celebrate your feasts. / ®ÁAriel sounds like a Hebrew term that means °∞hearth°± or °∞altar°±
23Is 29:2 Yet I will bring disaster upon you, and there will be much weeping and sorrow. For Jerusalem will become what her name Ariel means - an altar covered with blood.
23Is 29:3 I will be your enemy, surrounding Jerusalem and attacking its walls. I will build siege towers and destroy it.
23Is 29:4 Then deep from the earth you will speak; from low in the dust your words will come. Your voice will whisper from the ground like a ghost conjured up from the grave.
23Is 29:5 °∞But suddenly, your ruthless enemies will be crushed like the finest of dust. Your many attackers will be driven away like chaff before the wind. Suddenly, in an instant,
23Is 29:6 I, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, will act for you with thunder and earthquake and great noise, with whirlwind and storm and consuming fire.
23Is 29:7 All the nations fighting against Jerusalem®Á will vanish like a dream! Those who are attacking her walls will vanish like a vision in the night. / ®ÁHebrew Ariel
23Is 29:8 A hungry person dreams of eating but wakes up still hungry. A thirsty person dreams of drinking but is still faint from thirst when morning comes. So it will be with your enemies, with those who attack Mount Zion.°±
23Is 29:9 Are you amazed and incredulous? Don°Øt you believe it? Then go ahead and be blind. You are stupid, but not from wine! You stagger, but not from liquor!
23Is 29:10 For the Lord has poured out on you a spirit of deep sleep. He has closed the eyes of your prophets and visionaries.
23Is 29:11 All the future events in this vision are like a sealed book to them. When you give it to those who can read, they will say, °∞We can°Øt read it because it is sealed.°± 
23Is 29:12 When you give it to those who cannot read, they will say, °∞We don°Øt know how to read.°±
23Is 29:13 And so the Lord says, °∞These people say they are mine. They honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me. And their worship of me is nothing but man-made rules learned by rote®Á. / ®ÁGreek version reads Their worship is a farce, / for they teach man-made ideas as commands from God. Compare Mark 7.7
23Is 29:14 Because of this, I will once again astound these hypocrites with amazing wonders. The wisdom of the wise will pass away, and the intelligence of the intelligent will disappear.°±
23Is 29:15 What sorrow awaits those who try to hide their plans from the Lord, who do their evil deeds in the dark! °∞The Lord can°Øt see us,°± they say. °∞He doesn°Øt know what°Øs going on!°±
23Is 29:16 How foolish can you be? He is the Potter, and he is certainly greater than you, the clay! Should the created thing say of the one who made it, °∞He didn°Øt make me°±? Does a jar ever say, °∞The potter who made me is stupid°±?
23Is 29:17 Soon - and it will not be very long - the forests of Lebanon will become a fertile field, and the fertile field will yield bountiful crops.
23Is 29:18 In that day the deaf will hear words read from a book, and the blind will see through the gloom and darkness.
23Is 29:19 The humble will be filled with fresh joy from the Lord. The poor will rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 29:20 The scoffer will be gone, the arrogant will disappear, and those who plot evil will be killed.
23Is 29:21 Those who convict the innocent by their false testimony will disappear. A similar fate awaits those who use trickery to pervert justice and who tell lies to destroy the innocent.
23Is 29:22 That is why the Lord, who redeemed Abraham, says to the people of Israel®Á, °∞My people will no longer be ashamed or turn pale with fear. / ®ÁHebrew of Jacob. See note on 14.1
23Is 29:23 For when they see their many children and all the blessings I have given them, they will recognize the holiness of the Holy One of Israel. They will stand in awe of the God of Jacob.
23Is 29:24 Then the wayward will gain understanding, and complainers will accept instruction.
23Is 30:1 °∞What sorrow awaits my rebellious children,°± says the Lord. °∞You make plans that are contrary to mine. You make alliances not directed by my Spirit, thus piling up your sins.
23Is 30:2 For without consulting me, you have gone down to Egypt for help. You have put your trust in Pharaoh°Øs protection. You have tried to hide in his shade.
23Is 30:3 But by trusting Pharaoh, you will be humiliated, and by depending on him, you will be disgraced.
23Is 30:4 For though his power extends to Zoan and his officials have arrived in Hanes,
23Is 30:5 all who trust in him will be ashamed. He will not help you. Instead, he will disgrace you.°±
23Is 30:6 This message came to me concerning the animals in the Negev. The caravan moves slowly across the terrible desert to Egypt - donkeys weighed down with riches and camels loaded with treasure - all to pay for Egypt°Øs protection. They travel through the wilderness, a place of lionesses and lions, a place where vipers and poisonous snakes live. All this, and Egypt will give you nothing in return.
23Is 30:7 Egypt°Øs promises are worthless! Therefore, I call her Rahab - the Harmless Dragon®Á. / ®ÁHebrew Rahab who sits still. Rahab is the name of a mythical sea monster that represents chaos in ancient literature. The name is used here as a poetic name for Egypt
23Is 30:8 Now go and write down these words. Write them in a book. They will stand until the end of time as a witness
23Is 30:9 that these people are stubborn rebels who refuse to pay attention to the Lord°Øs instructions.
23Is 30:10 They tell the seers, °∞Stop seeing visions!°± They tell the prophets, °∞Don°Øt tell us what is right. Tell us nice things. Tell us lies.
23Is 30:11 Forget all this gloom. Get off your narrow path. Stop telling us about your °ÆHoly One of Israel.°Ø°±
23Is 30:12 This is the reply of the Holy One of Israel. °∞Because you despise what I tell you and trust instead in oppression and lies,
23Is 30:13 calamity will come upon you suddenly - like a bulging wall that bursts and falls. In an instant it will collapse and come crashing down.
23Is 30:14 You will be smashed like a piece of pottery - shattered so completely that there won°Øt be a piece big enough to carry coals from a fireplace or a little water from the well.°±
23Is 30:15 This is what the Sovereign Lord, the Holy One of Israel, says. °∞Only in returning to me and resting in me will you be saved. In quietness and confidence is your strength. But you would have none of it.
23Is 30:16 You said, °ÆNo, we will get our help from Egypt. They will give us swift horses for riding into battle.°Ø But the only swiftness you are going to see is the swiftness of your enemies chasing you!
23Is 30:17 One of them will chase a thousand of you. Five of them will make all of you flee. You will be left like a lonely flagpole on a hill or a tattered banner on a distant mountaintop.°±
23Is 30:18 So the Lord must wait for you to come to him so he can show you his love and compassion. For the Lord is a faithful God. Blessed are those who wait for his help.
23Is 30:19 O people of Zion, who live in Jerusalem, you will weep no more. He will be gracious if you ask for help. He will surely respond to the sound of your cries.
23Is 30:20 Though the Lord gave you adversity for food and suffering for drink, he will still be with you to teach you. You will see your teacher with your own eyes.
23Is 30:21 Your own ears will hear him. Right behind you a voice will say, °∞This is the way you should go,°± whether to the right or to the left.
23Is 30:22 Then you will destroy all your silver idols and your precious gold images. You will throw them out like filthy rags, saying to them, °∞Good riddance!°±
23Is 30:23 Then the Lord will bless you with rain at planting time. There will be wonderful harvests and plenty of pastureland for your livestock. 
23Is 30:24 The oxen and donkeys that till the ground will eat good grain, its chaff blown away by the wind. 
23Is 30:25 In that day, when your enemies are slaughtered and the towers fall, there will be streams of water flowing down every mountain and hill. 
23Is 30:26 The moon will be as bright as the sun, and the sun will be seven times brighter - like the light of seven days in one! So it will be when the Lord begins to heal his people and cure the wounds he gave them.
23Is 30:27 Look! The Lord is coming from far away, burning with anger, surrounded by thick, rising smoke. His lips are filled with fury; his words consume like fire.
23Is 30:28 His hot breath pours out like a flood up to the neck of his enemies. He will sift out the proud nations for destruction. He will bridle them and lead them away to ruin.
23Is 30:29 But the people of God will sing a song of joy, like the songs at the holy festivals. You will be filled with joy, as when a flutist leads a group of pilgrims to Jerusalem, the mountain of the Lord - to the Rock of Israel.
23Is 30:30 And the Lord will make his majestic voice heard. He will display the strength of his mighty arm. It will descend with devouring flames, with cloudbursts, thunderstorms, and huge hailstones.
23Is 30:31 At the Lord°Øs command, the Assyrians will be shattered. He will strike them down with his royal scepter.
23Is 30:32 And as the Lord strikes them with his rod of punishment, his people will celebrate with tambourines and harps. Lifting his mighty arm, he will fight the Assyrians.
23Is 30:33 Topheth - the place of burning - has long been ready for the Assyrian king; the pyre is piled high with wood. The breath of the Lord, like fire from a volcano, will set it ablaze.
23Is 31:1 What sorrow awaits those who look to Egypt for help, trusting their horses, chariots, and charioteers and depending on the strength of human armies instead of looking to the Lord, the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 31:2 In his wisdom, the Lord will send great disaster; he will not change his mind. He will rise against the wicked and against their helpers.
23Is 31:3 For these Egyptians are mere humans, not God! Their horses are puny flesh, not mighty spirits! When the Lord raises his fist against them, those who help will stumble, and those being helped will fall. They will all fall down and die together.
23Is 31:4 But this is what the Lord has told me. °∞When a strong young lion stands growling over a sheep it has killed, it is not frightened by the shouts and noise of a whole crowd of shepherds. In the same way, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies will come down and fight on Mount Zion.
23Is 31:5 The Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies will hover over Jerusalem and protect it like a bird protecting its nest. He will defend and save the city; he will pass over it and rescue it.°±
23Is 31:6 Though you are such wicked rebels, my people, come and return to the Lord. 
23Is 31:7 I know the glorious day will come when each of you will throw away the gold idols and silver images your sinful hands have made.
23Is 31:8 °∞The Assyrians will be destroyed, but not by the swords of men. The sword of God will strike them, and they will panic and flee. The strong young Assyrians will be taken away as captives. 
23Is 31:9 Even the strongest will quake with terror, and princes will flee when they see your battle flags,°± says the Lord, whose fire burns in Zion, whose flame blazes from Jerusalem.
23Is 32:1 Look, a righteous king is coming! And honest princes will rule under him.
23Is 32:2 Each one will be like a shelter from the wind and a refuge from the storm, like streams of water in the desert and the shadow of a great rock in a parched land.
23Is 32:3 Then everyone who has eyes will be able to see the truth, and everyone who has ears will be able to hear it.
23Is 32:4 Even the hotheads will be full of sense and understanding. Those who stammer will speak out plainly.
23Is 32:5 In that day ungodly fools will not be heroes. Scoundrels will not be respected.
23Is 32:6 For fools speak foolishness and make evil plans. They practice ungodliness and spread false teachings about the Lord. They deprive the hungry of food and give no water to the thirsty.
23Is 32:7 The smooth tricks of scoundrels are evil. They plot crooked schemes. They lie to convict the poor, even when the cause of the poor is just.
23Is 32:8 But generous people plan to do what is generous, and they stand firm in their generosity.
23Is 32:9 Listen, you women who lie around in ease. Listen to me, you who are so smug.
23Is 32:10 In a short time - just a little more than a year - you careless ones will suddenly begin to care. For your fruit crops will fail, and the harvest will never take place.
23Is 32:11 Tremble, you women of ease; throw off your complacency. Strip off your pretty clothes, and put on burlap to show your grief.
23Is 32:12 Beat your breasts in sorrow for your bountiful farms and your fruitful grapevines.
23Is 32:13 For your land will be overgrown with thorns and briers. Your joyful homes and happy towns will be gone.
23Is 32:14 The palace and the city will be deserted, and busy towns will be empty. Wild donkeys will frolic and flocks will graze in the empty forts®Á and watchtowers / ®ÁHebrew the Ophel
23Is 32:15 until at last the Spirit is poured out on us from heaven. Then the wilderness will become a fertile field, and the fertile field will yield bountiful crops.
23Is 32:16 Justice will rule in the wilderness and righteousness in the fertile field.
23Is 32:17 And this righteousness will bring peace. Yes, it will bring quietness and confidence forever.
23Is 32:18 My people will live in safety, quietly at home. They will be at rest.
23Is 32:19 Even if the forest should be destroyed and the city torn down,
23Is 32:20 the Lord will greatly bless his people. Wherever they plant seed, bountiful crops will spring up. Their cattle and donkeys will graze freely.
23Is 33:1 What sorrow awaits you Assyrians, who have destroyed others®Á but have never been destroyed yourselves. You betray others, but you have never been betrayed. When you are done destroying, you will be destroyed. When you are done betraying, you will be betrayed. / ®ÁHebrew What sorrow awaits you, O destroyer. The Hebrew text does not specifically name Assyria as the object of the prophecy in this chapter
23Is 33:2 But Lord, be merciful to us, for we have waited for you. Be our strong arm each day and our salvation in times of trouble.
23Is 33:3 The enemy runs at the sound of your voice. When you stand up, the nations flee!
23Is 33:4 Just as caterpillars and locusts strip the fields and vines, so the fallen army of Assyria will be stripped!
23Is 33:5 Though the Lord is very great and lives in heaven, he will make Jerusalem®Á his home of justice and righteousness. / ®ÁHebrew Zion; also in 33.14
23Is 33:6 In that day he will be your sure foundation, providing a rich store of salvation, wisdom, and knowledge. The fear of the Lord will be your treasure.
23Is 33:7 But now your brave warriors weep in public. Your ambassadors of peace cry in bitter disappointment.
23Is 33:8 Your roads are deserted; no one travels them anymore. The Assyrians have broken their peace treaty and care nothing for the promises they made before witnesses®Á. They have no respect for anyone. / ®ÁAs in Dead Sea Scrolls; Masoretic Text reads care nothing for the cities
23Is 33:9 The land of Israel wilts in mourning. Lebanon withers with shame. The plain of Sharon is now a wilderness. Bashan and Carmel have been plundered.
23Is 33:10 But the Lord says£∫ °∞Now I will stand up. Now I will show my power and might.
23Is 33:11 You Assyrians produce nothing but dry grass and stubble. Your own breath will turn to fire and consume you.
23Is 33:12 Your people will be burned up completely, like thornbushes cut down and tossed in a fire.
23Is 33:13 Listen to what I have done, you nations far away! And you that are near, acknowledge my might!°±
23Is 33:14 The sinners in Jerusalem shake with fear. Terror seizes the godless. °∞Who can live with this devouring fire?°± they cry. °∞Who can survive this all-consuming fire?°±
23Is 33:15 Those who are honest and fair, who refuse to profit by fraud, who stay far away from bribes, who refuse to listen to those who plot murder, who shut their eyes to all enticement to do wrong - 
23Is 33:16 these are the ones who will dwell on high. The rocks of the mountains will be their fortress. Food will be supplied to them, and they will have water in abundance.
23Is 33:17 Your eyes will see the king in all his splendor, and you will see a land that stretches into the distance.
23Is 33:18 You will think back to this time of terror, asking, °∞Where are the Assyrian officers who counted our towers? Where are the bookkeepers who recorded the plunder taken from our fallen city?°±
23Is 33:19 You will no longer see these fierce, violent people with their strange, unknown language.
23Is 33:20 Instead, you will see Zion as a place of holy festivals. You will see Jerusalem, a city quiet and secure. It will be like a tent whose ropes are taut and whose stakes are firmly fixed.
23Is 33:21 The Lord will be our Mighty One. He will be like a wide river of protection that no enemy can cross, that no enemy ship can sail upon.
23Is 33:22 For the Lord is our judge, our lawgiver, and our king. He will care for us and save us.
23Is 33:23 The enemies°Ø sails hang loose on broken masts with useless tackle. Their treasure will be divided by the people of God. Even the lame will take their share!
23Is 33:24 The people of Israel will no longer say, °∞We are sick and helpless,°± for the Lord will forgive their sins.
23Is 34:1 Come here and listen, O nations of the earth. Let the world and everything in it hear my words.
23Is 34:2 For the Lord is enraged against the nations. His fury is against all their armies. He will completely destroy®Á them, dooming them to slaughter. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the Lord, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering; similarly in 34.5
23Is 34:3 Their dead will be left unburied, and the stench of rotting bodies will fill the land. The mountains will flow with their blood.
23Is 34:4 The heavens above will melt away and disappear like a rolled-up scroll. The stars will fall from the sky like withered leaves from a grapevine, or shriveled figs from a fig tree.
23Is 34:5 And when my sword has finished its work in the heavens, it will fall upon Edom, the nation I have marked for destruction.
23Is 34:6 The sword of the Lord is drenched with blood and covered with fat - with the blood of lambs and goats, with the fat of rams prepared for sacrifice. Yes, the Lord will offer a sacrifice in the city of Bozrah. He will make a mighty slaughter in Edom.
23Is 34:7 Even men as strong as wild oxen will die - the young men alongside the veterans. The land will be soaked with blood and the soil enriched with fat.
23Is 34:8 For it is the day of the Lord°Øs revenge, the year when Edom will be paid back for all it did to Israel®Á. / ®ÁHebrew to Zion
23Is 34:9 The streams of Edom will be filled with burning pitch, and the ground will be covered with fire.
23Is 34:10 This judgment on Edom will never end; the smoke of its burning will rise forever. The land will lie deserted from generation to generation. No one will live there anymore.
23Is 34:11 It will be haunted by the desert owl and the screech owl, the great owl and the raven®Á. For God will measure that land carefully; he will measure it for chaos and destruction. / ®ÁThe identification of some of these birds is uncertain
23Is 34:12 It will be called the Land of Nothing, and all its nobles will soon be gone®Á. / ®ÁThe meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
23Is 34:13 Thorns will overrun its palaces; nettles and thistles will grow in its forts. The ruins will become a haunt for jackals and a home for owls.
23Is 34:14 Desert animals will mingle there with hyenas, their howls filling the night. Wild goats will bleat at one another among the ruins, and night creatures®Á will come there to rest. / ®ÁHebrew Lilith, possibly a reference to a mythical demon of the night
23Is 34:15 There the owl will make her nest and lay her eggs. She will hatch her young and cover them with her wings. And the buzzards will come, each one with its mate.
23Is 34:16 Search the book of the Lord, and see what he will do. Not one of these birds and animals will be missing, and none will lack a mate, for the Lord has promised this. His Spirit will make it all come true.
23Is 34:17 He has surveyed and divided the land and deeded it over to those creatures. They will possess it forever, from generation to generation.
23Is 35:1 Even the wilderness and desert will be glad in those days. The wasteland will rejoice and blossom with spring crocuses.
23Is 35:2 Yes, there will be an abundance of flowers and singing and joy! The deserts will become as green as the mountains of Lebanon, as lovely as Mount Carmel or the plain of Sharon. There the Lord will display his glory, the splendor of our God.
23Is 35:3 With this news, strengthen those who have tired hands, and encourage those who have weak knees.
23Is 35:4 Say to those with fearful hearts, °∞Be strong, and do not fear, for your God is coming to destroy your enemies. He is coming to save you.°±
23Is 35:5 And when he comes, he will open the eyes of the blind and unplug the ears of the deaf.
23Is 35:6 The lame will leap like a deer, and those who cannot speak will sing for joy! Springs will gush forth in the wilderness, and streams will water the wasteland.
23Is 35:7 The parched ground will become a pool, and springs of water will satisfy the thirsty land. Marsh grass and reeds and rushes will flourish where desert jackals once lived.
23Is 35:8 And a great road will go through that once deserted land. It will be named the Highway of Holiness. Evil-minded people will never travel on it. It will be only for those who walk in God°Øs ways; fools will never walk there.
23Is 35:9 Lions will not lurk along its course, nor any other ferocious beasts. There will be no other dangers. Only the redeemed will walk on it.
23Is 35:10 Those who have been ransomed by the Lord will return. They will enter Jerusalem®Á singing, crowned with everlasting joy. Sorrow and mourning will disappear, and they will be filled with joy and gladness. / ®ÁHebrew Zion
23Is 36:1 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah°Øs reign®Á, King Sennacherib of Assyria came to attack the fortified towns of Judah and conquered them. / ®ÁThe fourteenth year of Hezekiah°Øs reign was 701 b.c.
23Is 36:2 Then the king of Assyria sent his chief of staff®Á from Lachish with a huge army to confront King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. The Assyrians took up a position beside the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool, near the road leading to the field where cloth is washed®Ë. / ®ÁOr the rabshakeh; also in 36.4, 11, 12, 22. ®ËOr bleached
23Is 36:3 These are the officials who went out to meet with them£∫ Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, the royal historian.
23Is 36:4 Then the Assyrian king°Øs chief of staff told them to give this message to Hezekiah. °∞This is what the great king of Assyria says£∫ What are you trusting in that makes you so confident? 
23Is 36:5 Do you think that mere words can substitute for military skill and strength? Who are you counting on, that you have rebelled against me? 
23Is 36:6 On Egypt? If you lean on Egypt, it will be like a reed that splinters beneath your weight and pierces your hand. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is completely unreliable!
23Is 36:7 °∞But perhaps you will say to me, °ÆWe are trusting in the Lord our God!°Ø But isn°Øt he the one who was insulted by Hezekiah? Didn°Øt Hezekiah tear down his shrines and altars and make everyone in Judah and Jerusalem worship only at the altar here in Jerusalem?
23Is 36:8 °∞I°Øll tell you what! Strike a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you 2,000 horses if you can find that many men to ride on them! 
23Is 36:9 With your tiny army, how can you think of challenging even the weakest contingent of my master°Øs troops, even with the help of Egypt°Øs chariots and charioteers? 
23Is 36:10 What°Øs more, do you think we have invaded your land without the Lord°Øs direction? The Lord himself told us, °ÆAttack this land and destroy it!°Ø°±
23Is 36:11 Then Eliakim, Shebna, and Joah said to the Assyrian chief of staff, °∞Please speak to us in Aramaic, for we understand it well. Don°Øt speak in Hebrew®Á, for the people on the wall will hear.°± / ®ÁHebrew in the dialect of Judah; also in 36.13
23Is 36:12 But Sennacherib°Øs chief of staff replied, °∞Do you think my master sent this message only to you and your master? He wants all the people to hear it, for when we put this city under siege, they will suffer along with you. They will be so hungry and thirsty that they will eat their own dung and drink their own urine.°±
23Is 36:13 Then the chief of staff stood and shouted in Hebrew to the people on the wall, °∞Listen to this message from the great king of Assyria! 
23Is 36:14 This is what the king says£∫ Don°Øt let Hezekiah deceive you. He will never be able to rescue you. 
23Is 36:15 Don°Øt let him fool you into trusting in the Lord by saying, °ÆThe Lord will surely rescue us. This city will never fall into the hands of the Assyrian king!°Ø
23Is 36:16 °∞Don°Øt listen to Hezekiah! These are the terms the king of Assyria is offering£∫ Make peace with me - open the gates and come out. Then each of you can continue eating from your own grapevine and fig tree and drinking from your own well. 
23Is 36:17 Then I will arrange to take you to another land like this one - a land of grain and new wine, bread and vineyards.
23Is 36:18 °∞Don°Øt let Hezekiah mislead you by saying, °ÆThe Lord will rescue us!°Ø Have the gods of any other nations ever saved their people from the king of Assyria? 
23Is 36:19 What happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad? And what about the gods of Sepharvaim? Did any god rescue Samaria from my power? 
23Is 36:20 What god of any nation has ever been able to save its people from my power? So what makes you think that the Lord can rescue Jerusalem from me?°±
23Is 36:21 But the people were silent and did not utter a word because Hezekiah had commanded them, °∞Do not answer him.°±
23Is 36:22 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, the royal historian, went back to Hezekiah. They tore their clothes in despair, and they went in to see the king and told him what the Assyrian chief of staff had said.
23Is 37:1 When King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes and put on burlap and went into the Temple of the Lord. 
23Is 37:2 And he sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the court secretary, and the leading priests, all dressed in burlap, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz. 
23Is 37:3 They told him, °∞This is what King Hezekiah says£∫ Today is a day of trouble, insults, and disgrace. It is like when a child is ready to be born, but the mother has no strength to deliver the baby. 
23Is 37:4 But perhaps the Lord your God has heard the Assyrian chief of staff®Á, sent by the king to defy the living God, and will punish him for his words. Oh, pray for those of us who are left!°± / ®ÁOr the rabshakeh; also in 37.8
23Is 37:5 After King Hezekiah°Øs officials delivered the king°Øs message to Isaiah, 
23Is 37:6 the prophet replied, °∞Say to your master, °ÆThis is what the Lord says£∫ Do not be disturbed by this blasphemous speech against me from the Assyrian king°Øs messengers. 
23Is 37:7 Listen! I myself will move against him®Á, and the king will receive a message that he is needed at home. So he will return to his land, where I will have him killed with a sword.°Ø°± / ®ÁHebrew I will put a spirit in him
23Is 37:8 Meanwhile, the Assyrian chief of staff left Jerusalem and went to consult the king of Assyria, who had left Lachish and was attacking Libnah.
23Is 37:9 Soon afterward King Sennacherib received word that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia®Á was leading an army to fight against him. Before leaving to meet the attack, he sent messengers back to Hezekiah in Jerusalem with this message. / ®ÁHebrew of Cush
23Is 37:10 °∞This message is for King Hezekiah of Judah. Don°Øt let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you with promises that Jerusalem will not be captured by the king of Assyria. 
23Is 37:11 You know perfectly well what the kings of Assyria have done wherever they have gone. They have completely destroyed everyone who stood in their way! Why should you be any different? 
23Is 37:12 Have the gods of other nations rescued them - such nations as Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Tel-assar? My predecessors destroyed them all! 
23Is 37:13 What happened to the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad? What happened to the kings of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?°±
23Is 37:14 After Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it, he went up to the Lord°Øs Temple and spread it out before the Lord. 
23Is 37:15 And Hezekiah prayed this prayer before the Lord£∫ 
23Is 37:16 °∞O Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, God of Israel, you are enthroned between the mighty cherubim! You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You alone created the heavens and the earth. 
23Is 37:17 Bend down, O Lord, and listen! Open your eyes, O Lord, and see! Listen to Sennacherib°Øs words of defiance against the living God.
23Is 37:18 °∞It is true, Lord, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all these nations. 
23Is 37:19 And they have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire and burned them. But of course the Assyrians could destroy them! They were not gods at all - only idols of wood and stone shaped by human hands. 
23Is 37:20 Now, O Lord our God, rescue us from his power; then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you alone, O Lord, are God®Á.°± / ®ÁAs in Dead Sea Scrolls (see also 2 Kgs 19.19); Masoretic Text reads you alone are the Lord
23Is 37:21 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah£∫ °∞This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says£∫ Because you prayed about King Sennacherib of Assyria, 
23Is 37:22 the Lord has spoken this word against him. °∞The virgin daughter of Zion despises you and laughs at you. The daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head in derision as you flee.
23Is 37:23 °∞Whom have you been defying and ridiculing? Against whom did you raise your voice? At whom did you look with such haughty eyes? It was the Holy One of Israel!
23Is 37:24 By your messengers you have defied the Lord. You have said, °ÆWith my many chariots I have conquered the highest mountains - yes, the remotest peaks of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars and its finest cypress trees. I have reached its farthest heights and explored its deepest forests.
23Is 37:25 I have dug wells in many foreign lands®Á and refreshed myself with their water. With the sole of my foot, I stopped up all the rivers of Egypt!°Ø / ®ÁAs in Dead Sea Scrolls (see also 2 Kgs 19.24); Masoretic Text lacks in many foreign lands
23Is 37:26 °∞But have you not heard? I decided this long ago. Long ago I planned it, and now I am making it happen. I planned for you to crush fortified cities into heaps of rubble.
23Is 37:27 That is why their people have so little power and are so frightened and confused. They are as weak as grass, as easily trampled as tender green shoots. They are like grass sprouting on a housetop, scorched®Á before it can grow lush and tall. / ®ÁAs in Dead Sea Scrolls and some Greek manuscripts (see also 2 Kgs 19.26); most Hebrew manuscripts read like a terraced field
23Is 37:28 °∞But I know you well - where you stay and when you come and go. I know the way you have raged against me.
23Is 37:29 And because of your raging against me and your arrogance, which I have heard for myself, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth. I will make you return by the same road on which you came.°±
23Is 37:30 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, °∞Here is the proof that what I say is true. °∞This year you will eat only what grows up by itself, and next year you will eat what springs up from that. But in the third year you will plant crops and harvest them; you will tend vineyards and eat their fruit.
23Is 37:31 And you who are left in Judah, who have escaped the ravages of the siege, will put roots down in your own soil and grow up and flourish.
23Is 37:32 For a remnant of my people will spread out from Jerusalem, a group of survivors from Mount Zion. The passionate commitment of the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies will make this happen!
23Is 37:33 °∞And this is what the Lord says about the king of Assyria. °∞°ÆHis armies will not enter Jerusalem. They will not even shoot an arrow at it. They will not march outside its gates with their shields nor build banks of earth against its walls.
23Is 37:34 The king will return to his own country by the same road on which he came. He will not enter this city,°Ø says the Lord.
23Is 37:35 °ÆFor my own honor and for the sake of my servant David, I will defend this city and protect it.°Ø°±
23Is 37:36 That night the angel of the Lord went out to the Assyrian camp and killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. When the surviving Assyrians®Á woke up the next morning, they found corpses everywhere. / ®ÁHebrew When they
23Is 37:37 Then King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and returned to his own land. He went home to his capital of Nineveh and stayed there.
23Is 37:38 One day while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with their swords. They then escaped to the land of Ararat, and another son, Esarhaddon, became the next king of Assyria.
23Is 38:1 About that time Hezekiah became deathly ill, and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to visit him. He gave the king this message£∫ °∞This is what the Lord says£∫ °ÆSet your affairs in order, for you are going to die. You will not recover from this illness.°Ø°±
23Is 38:2 When Hezekiah heard this, he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord, 
23Is 38:3 °∞Remember, O Lord, how I have always been faithful to you and have served you single-mindedly, always doing what pleases you.°± Then he broke down and wept bitterly.
23Is 38:4 Then this message came to Isaiah from the Lord£∫ 
23Is 38:5 °∞Go back to Hezekiah and tell him, °ÆThis is what the Lord, the God of your ancestor David, says£∫ I have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I will add fifteen years to your life, 
23Is 38:6 and I will rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria. Yes, I will defend this city.
23Is 38:7 °∞°ÆAnd this is the sign from the Lord to prove that he will do as he promised£∫

23Is 38:9 When King Hezekiah was well again, he wrote this poem.
23Is 38:10 I said, °∞In the prime of my life, must I now enter the place of the dead?®Á Am I to be robbed of the rest of my years?°± / ®ÁHebrew enter the gates of Sheol?
23Is 38:11 I said, °∞Never again will I see the Lord God while still in the land of the living. Never again will I see my friends or be with those who live in this world.
23Is 38:12 My life has been blown away like a shepherd°Øs tent in a storm. It has been cut short, as when a weaver cuts cloth from a loom. Suddenly, my life was over.
23Is 38:13 I waited patiently all night, but I was torn apart as though by lions. Suddenly, my life was over.
23Is 38:14 Delirious, I chattered like a swallow or a crane, and then I moaned like a mourning dove. My eyes grew tired of looking to heaven for help. I am in trouble, Lord. Help me!°±
23Is 38:15 But what could I say? For he himself sent this sickness. Now I will walk humbly throughout my years because of this anguish I have felt.
23Is 38:16 Lord, your discipline is good, for it leads to life and health. You restore my health and allow me to live!
23Is 38:17 Yes, this anguish was good for me, for you have rescued me from death and forgiven all my sins.
23Is 38:18 For the dead®Á cannot praise you; they cannot raise their voices in praise. Those who go down to the grave can no longer hope in your faithfulness. / ®ÁHebrew Sheol
23Is 38:19 Only the living can praise you as I do today. Each generation tells of your faithfulness to the next.
23Is 38:20 Think of it - the Lord is ready to heal me! I will sing his praises with instruments every day of my life in the Temple of the Lord.
23Is 38:21 Isaiah had said to Hezekiah°Øs servants, °∞Make an ointment from figs and spread it over the boil, and Hezekiah will recover.°±
23Is 38:22 And Hezekiah had asked, °∞What sign will prove that I will go to the Temple of the Lord?°±
23Is 39:1 Soon after this, Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent Hezekiah his best wishes and a gift. He had heard that Hezekiah had been very sick and that he had recovered. 
23Is 39:2 Hezekiah was delighted with the Babylonian envoys and showed them everything in his treasure-houses - the silver, the gold, the spices, and the aromatic oils. He also took them to see his armory and showed them everything in his royal treasuries! There was nothing in his palace or kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
23Is 39:3 Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, °∞What did those men want? Where were they from?°± Hezekiah replied, °∞They came from the distant land of Babylon.°±
23Is 39:4 °∞What did they see in your palace?°± asked Isaiah. °∞They saw everything,°± Hezekiah replied. °∞I showed them everything I own - all my royal treasuries.°±
23Is 39:5 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, °∞Listen to this message from the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies£∫ 
23Is 39:6 °ÆThe time is coming when everything in your palace - all the treasures stored up by your ancestors until now - will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left,°Ø says the Lord. 
23Is 39:7 °ÆSome of your very own sons will be taken away into exile. They will become eunuchs who will serve in the palace of Babylon°Øs king.°Ø°±
23Is 39:8 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, °∞This message you have given me from the Lord is good.°± For the king was thinking, °∞At least there will be peace and security during my lifetime.°±
23Is 40:1 °∞Comfort, comfort my people,°± says your God.
23Is 40:2 °∞Speak tenderly to Jerusalem. Tell her that her sad days are gone and her sins are pardoned. Yes, the Lord has punished her twice over for all her sins.°±
23Is 40:3 Listen! It°Øs the voice of someone shouting, °∞Clear the way through the wilderness for the Lord! Make a straight highway through the wasteland for our God!
23Is 40:4 Fill in the valleys, and level the mountains and hills. Straighten the curves, and smooth out the rough places.
23Is 40:5 Then the glory of the Lord will be revealed, and all people will see it together. The Lord has spoken!°±®Á / ®ÁGreek version reads He is a voice shouting in the wilderness, °∞Prepare the way for the Lord°Øs coming! Clear a road for our God!

The Lord has spoken!°± Compare Matt 3.3; Mark 1.3; Luke 3.4-6
23Is 40:6 A voice said, °∞Shout!°± I asked, °∞What should I shout?°± °∞Shout that people are like the grass. Their beauty fades as quickly as the flowers in a field.

23Is 40:10 Yes, the Sovereign Lord is coming in power. He will rule with a powerful arm. See, he brings his reward with him as he comes.
23Is 40:11 He will feed his flock like a shepherd. He will carry the lambs in his arms, holding them close to his heart. He will gently lead the mother sheep with their young.
23Is 40:12 Who else has held the oceans in his hand? Who has measured off the heavens with his fingers? Who else knows the weight of the earth or has weighed the mountains and hills on a scale?
23Is 40:13 Who is able to advise the Spirit of the Lord?®Á Who knows enough to give him advice or teach him? / ®ÁGreek version reads Who can know the Lord°Øs thoughts? Compare Rom 11.34; 1 Cor 2.16
23Is 40:14 Has the Lord ever needed anyone°Øs advice? Does he need instruction about what is good? Did someone teach him what is right or show him the path of justice?
23Is 40:15 No, for all the nations of the world are but a drop in the bucket. They are nothing more than dust on the scales. He picks up the whole earth as though it were a grain of sand.
23Is 40:16 All the wood in Lebanon°Øs forests and all Lebanon°Øs animals would not be enough to make a burnt offering worthy of our God.
23Is 40:17 The nations of the world are worth nothing to him. In his eyes they count for less than nothing - mere emptiness and froth.
23Is 40:18 To whom can you compare God? What image can you find to resemble him?
23Is 40:19 Can he be compared to an idol formed in a mold, overlaid with gold, and decorated with silver chains?
23Is 40:20 Or if people are too poor for that, they might at least choose wood that won°Øt decay and a skilled craftsman to carve an image that won°Øt fall down!
23Is 40:21 Haven°Øt you heard? Don°Øt you understand? Are you deaf to the words of God - the words he gave before the world began? Are you so ignorant?
23Is 40:22 God sits above the circle of the earth. The people below seem like grasshoppers to him! He spreads out the heavens like a curtain and makes his tent from them.
23Is 40:23 He judges the great people of the world and brings them all to nothing.
23Is 40:24 They hardly get started, barely taking root, when he blows on them and they wither. The wind carries them off like chaff.
23Is 40:25 °∞To whom will you compare me? Who is my equal?°± asks the Holy One.
23Is 40:26 Look up into the heavens. Who created all the stars? He brings them out like an army, one after another, calling each by its name. Because of his great power and incomparable strength, not a single one is missing.
23Is 40:27 O Jacob, how can you say the Lord does not see your troubles? O Israel, how can you say God ignores your rights?
23Is 40:28 Have you never heard? Have you never understood? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of all the earth. He never grows weak or weary. No one can measure the depths of his understanding.
23Is 40:29 He gives power to the weak and strength to the powerless.
23Is 40:30 Even youths will become weak and tired, and young men will fall in exhaustion.
23Is 40:31 But those who trust in the Lord will find new strength. They will soar high on wings like eagles. They will run and not grow weary. They will walk and not faint.
23Is 41:1 °∞Listen in silence before me, you lands beyond the sea. Bring your strongest arguments. Come now and speak. The court is ready for your case.
23Is 41:2 °∞Who has stirred up this king from the east, rightly calling him to God°Øs service? Who gives this man victory over many nations and permits him to trample their kings underfoot? With his sword, he reduces armies to dust. With his bow, he scatters them like chaff before the wind.
23Is 41:3 He chases them away and goes on safely, though he is walking over unfamiliar ground.
23Is 41:4 Who has done such mighty deeds, summoning each new generation from the beginning of time? It is I, the Lord, the First and the Last. I alone am he.°±
23Is 41:5 The lands beyond the sea watch in fear. Remote lands tremble and mobilize for war.
23Is 41:6 The idol makers encourage one another, saying to each other, °∞Be strong!°±
23Is 41:7 The carver encourages the goldsmith, and the molder helps at the anvil. °∞Good,°± they say. °∞It°Øs coming along fine.°± Carefully they join the parts together, then fasten the thing in place so it won°Øt fall over.
23Is 41:8 °∞But as for you, Israel my servant, Jacob my chosen one, descended from Abraham my friend,
23Is 41:9 I have called you back from the ends of the earth, saying, °ÆYou are my servant.°Ø For I have chosen you and will not throw you away.
23Is 41:10 Don°Øt be afraid, for I am with you. Don°Øt be discouraged, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you. I will hold you up with my victorious right hand.
23Is 41:11 °∞See, all your angry enemies lie there, confused and humiliated. Anyone who opposes you will die and come to nothing.
23Is 41:12 You will look in vain for those who tried to conquer you. Those who attack you will come to nothing.
23Is 41:13 For I hold you by your right hand - I, the Lord your God. And I say to you, °ÆDon°Øt be afraid. I am here to help you.
23Is 41:14 Though you are a lowly worm, O Jacob, don°Øt be afraid, people of Israel, for I will help you. I am the Lord, your Redeemer. I am the Holy One of Israel.°Ø
23Is 41:15 You will be a new threshing instrument with many sharp teeth. You will tear your enemies apart, making chaff of mountains.
23Is 41:16 You will toss them into the air, and the wind will blow them all away; a whirlwind will scatter them. Then you will rejoice in the Lord. You will glory in the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 41:17 °∞When the poor and needy search for water and there is none, and their tongues are parched from thirst, then I, the Lord, will answer them. I, the God of Israel, will never abandon them.
23Is 41:18 I will open up rivers for them on the high plateaus. I will give them fountains of water in the valleys. I will fill the desert with pools of water. Rivers fed by springs will flow across the parched ground.
23Is 41:19 I will plant trees in the barren desert - cedar, acacia, myrtle, olive, cypress, fir, and pine.
23Is 41:20 I am doing this so all who see this miracle will understand what it means - that it is the Lord who has done this, the Holy One of Israel who created it.
23Is 41:21 °∞Present the case for your idols,°± says the Lord. °∞Let them show what they can do,°± says the King of Israel®Á. / ®ÁHebrew the King of Jacob. See note on 14.1
23Is 41:22 °∞Let them try to tell us what happened long ago so that we may consider the evidence. Or let them tell us what the future holds, so we can know what°Øs going to happen.
23Is 41:23 Yes, tell us what will occur in the days ahead. Then we will know you are gods. In fact, do anything - good or bad! Do something that will amaze and frighten us.
23Is 41:24 But no! You are less than nothing and can do nothing at all. Those who choose you pollute themselves.
23Is 41:25 °∞But I have stirred up a leader who will come from the north. I have called him by name from the east. I will give him victory over kings and princes. He will trample them as a potter treads on clay.
23Is 41:26 °∞Who told you from the beginning that this would happen? Who predicted this, making you admit that he was right? No one said a word!
23Is 41:27 I was the first to tell Zion, °ÆLook! Help is on the way!°Ø®Á I will send Jerusalem a messenger with good news. / ®ÁOr °ÆLook! They are coming home°Ø
23Is 41:28 Not one of your idols told you this. Not one gave any answer when I asked.
23Is 41:29 See, they are all foolish, worthless things. All your idols are as empty as the wind.
23Is 42:1 °∞Look at my servant, whom I strengthen. He is my chosen one, who pleases me. I have put my Spirit upon him. He will bring justice to the nations.
23Is 42:2 He will not shout or raise his voice in public.
23Is 42:3 He will not crush the weakest reed or put out a flickering candle. He will bring justice to all who have been wronged.
23Is 42:4 He will not falter or lose heart until justice prevails throughout the earth. Even distant lands beyond the sea will wait for his instruction®Á.°± / ®ÁGreek version reads And his name will be the hope of all the world. Compare Matt 12.21
23Is 42:5 God, the Lord, created the heavens and stretched them out. He created the earth and everything in it. He gives breath to everyone, life to everyone who walks the earth. And it is he who says,
23Is 42:6 °∞I, the Lord, have called you to demonstrate my righteousness. I will take you by the hand and guard you, and I will give you to my people, Israel, as a symbol of my covenant with them. And you will be a light to guide the nations.
23Is 42:7 You will open the eyes of the blind. You will free the captives from prison, releasing those who sit in dark dungeons.
23Is 42:8 °∞I am the Lord; that is my name! I will not give my glory to anyone else, nor share my praise with carved idols.
23Is 42:9 Everything I prophesied has come true, and now I will prophesy again. I will tell you the future before it happens.°±
23Is 42:10 Sing a new song to the Lord! Sing his praises from the ends of the earth! Sing, all you who sail the seas, all you who live in distant coastlands.
23Is 42:11 Join in the chorus, you desert towns; let the villages of Kedar rejoice! Let the people of Sela sing for joy; shout praises from the mountaintops!
23Is 42:12 Let the whole world glorify the Lord; let it sing his praise.
23Is 42:13 The Lord will march forth like a mighty hero; he will come out like a warrior, full of fury. He will shout his battle cry and crush all his enemies.
23Is 42:14 He will say, °∞I have long been silent; yes, I have restrained myself. But now, like a woman in labor, I will cry and groan and pant.
23Is 42:15 I will level the mountains and hills and blight all their greenery. I will turn the rivers into dry land and will dry up all the pools.
23Is 42:16 I will lead blind Israel down a new path, guiding them along an unfamiliar way. I will brighten the darkness before them and smooth out the road ahead of them. Yes, I will indeed do these things; I will not forsake them.
23Is 42:17 But those who trust in idols, who say, °ÆYou are our gods,°Ø will be turned away in shame.
23Is 42:18 °∞Listen, you who are deaf! Look and see, you blind!
23Is 42:19 Who is as blind as my own people, my servant? Who is as deaf as my messenger? Who is as blind as my chosen people, the servant of the Lord?
23Is 42:20 You see and recognize what is right but refuse to act on it. You hear with your ears, but you don°Øt really listen.°±
23Is 42:21 Because he is righteous, the Lord has exalted his glorious law.
23Is 42:22 But his own people have been robbed and plundered, enslaved, imprisoned, and trapped. They are fair game for anyone and have no one to protect them, no one to take them back home.
23Is 42:23 Who will hear these lessons from the past and see the ruin that awaits you in the future?
23Is 42:24 Who allowed Israel to be robbed and hurt? It was the Lord, against whom we sinned, for the people would not walk in his path, nor would they obey his law.
23Is 42:25 Therefore, he poured out his fury on them and destroyed them in battle. They were enveloped in flames, but they still refused to understand. They were consumed by fire, but they did not learn their lesson.
23Is 43:1 But now, O Jacob, listen to the Lord who created you. O Israel, the one who formed you says, °∞Do not be afraid, for I have ransomed you. I have called you by name; you are mine.
23Is 43:2 When you go through deep waters, I will be with you. When you go through rivers of difficulty, you will not drown. When you walk through the fire of oppression, you will not be burned up; the flames will not consume you.
23Is 43:3 For I am the Lord, your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. I gave Egypt as a ransom for your freedom; I gave Ethiopia®Á and Seba in your place. / ®ÁHebrew Cush
23Is 43:4 Others were given in exchange for you. I traded their lives for yours because you are precious to me. You are honored, and I love you.
23Is 43:5 °∞Do not be afraid, for I am with you. I will gather you and your children from east and west.
23Is 43:6 I will say to the north and south, °ÆBring my sons and daughters back to Israel from the distant corners of the earth.

23Is 43:8 Bring out the people who have eyes but are blind, who have ears but are deaf.
23Is 43:9 Gather the nations together! Assemble the peoples of the world! Which of their idols has ever foretold such things? Which can predict what will happen tomorrow? Where are the witnesses of such predictions? Who can verify that they spoke the truth?
23Is 43:10 °∞But you are my witnesses, O Israel!°± says the Lord. °∞You are my servant. You have been chosen to know me, believe in me, and understand that I alone am God. There is no other God - there never has been, and there never will be.
23Is 43:11 I, yes I, am the Lord, and there is no other Savior.
23Is 43:12 First I predicted your rescue, then I saved you and proclaimed it to the world. No foreign god has ever done this. You are witnesses that I am the only God,°± says the Lord.
23Is 43:13 °∞From eternity to eternity I am God. No one can snatch anyone out of my hand. No one can undo what I have done.°±
23Is 43:14 This is what the Lord says - your Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel. °∞For your sakes I will send an army against Babylon, forcing the Babylonians®Á to flee in those ships they are so proud of. / ®ÁOr Chaldeans
23Is 43:15 I am the Lord, your Holy One, Israel°Øs Creator and King.
23Is 43:16 I am the Lord, who opened a way through the waters, making a dry path through the sea.
23Is 43:17 I called forth the mighty army of Egypt with all its chariots and horses. I drew them beneath the waves, and they drowned, their lives snuffed out like a smoldering candlewick.
23Is 43:18 °∞But forget all that - it is nothing compared to what I am going to do.
23Is 43:19 For I am about to do something new. See, I have already begun! Do you not see it? I will make a pathway through the wilderness. I will create rivers in the dry wasteland.
23Is 43:20 The wild animals in the fields will thank me, the jackals and owls, too, for giving them water in the desert. Yes, I will make rivers in the dry wasteland so my chosen people can be refreshed.
23Is 43:21 I have made Israel for myself, and they will someday honor me before the whole world.
23Is 43:22 °∞But, dear family of Jacob, you refuse to ask for my help. You have grown tired of me, O Israel!
23Is 43:23 You have not brought me sheep or goats for burnt offerings. You have not honored me with sacrifices, though I have not burdened and wearied you with requests for grain offerings and frankincense.
23Is 43:24 You have not brought me fragrant calamus or pleased me with the fat from sacrifices. Instead, you have burdened me with your sins and wearied me with your faults.
23Is 43:25 °∞I - yes, I alone - will blot out your sins for my own sake and will never think of them again.
23Is 43:26 Let us review the situation together, and you can present your case to prove your innocence.
23Is 43:27 From the very beginning, your first ancestor sinned against me; all your leaders broke my laws.
23Is 43:28 That is why I have disgraced your priests; I have decreed complete destruction®Á for Jacob and shame for Israel. / ®ÁThe Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the Lord, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering
23Is 44:1 °∞But now, listen to me, Jacob my servant, Israel my chosen one.
23Is 44:2 The Lord who made you and helps you says. Do not be afraid, O Jacob, my servant, O dear Israel®Á, my chosen one. / ®ÁHebrew Jeshurun, a term of endearment for Israel
23Is 44:3 For I will pour out water to quench your thirst and to irrigate your parched fields. And I will pour out my Spirit on your descendants, and my blessing on your children.
23Is 44:4 They will thrive like watered grass, like willows on a riverbank.
23Is 44:5 Some will proudly claim, °ÆI belong to the Lord.°Ø Others will say, °ÆI am a descendant of Jacob.°Ø Some will write the Lord°Øs name on their hands and will take the name of Israel as their own.°±
23Is 44:6 This is what the Lord says - Israel°Øs King and Redeemer, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies£∫ °∞I am the First and the Last; there is no other God.
23Is 44:7 Who is like me? Let him step forward and prove to you his power. Let him do as I have done since ancient times when I established a people and explained its future.
23Is 44:8 Do not tremble; do not be afraid. Did I not proclaim my purposes for you long ago? You are my witnesses - is there any other God? No! There is no other Rock - not one!°±
23Is 44:9 How foolish are those who manufacture idols. These prized objects are really worthless. The people who worship idols don°Øt know this, so they are all put to shame.
23Is 44:10 Who but a fool would make his own god - an idol that cannot help him one bit?
23Is 44:11 All who worship idols will be disgraced along with all these craftsmen - mere humans - who claim they can make a god. They may all stand together, but they will stand in terror and shame.
23Is 44:12 The blacksmith stands at his forge to make a sharp tool, pounding and shaping it with all his might. His work makes him hungry and weak. It makes him thirsty and faint.
23Is 44:13 Then the wood-carver measures a block of wood and draws a pattern on it. He works with chisel and plane and carves it into a human figure. He gives it human beauty and puts it in a little shrine.
23Is 44:14 He cuts down cedars; he selects the cypress and the oak; he plants the pine in the forest to be nourished by the rain.
23Is 44:15 Then he uses part of the wood to make a fire. With it he warms himself and bakes his bread. Then - yes, it°Øs true - he takes the rest of it and makes himself a god to worship! He makes an idol and bows down in front of it!
23Is 44:16 He burns part of the tree to roast his meat and to keep himself warm. He says, °∞Ah, that fire feels good.°±
23Is 44:17 Then he takes what°Øs left and makes his god£∫ a carved idol! He falls down in front of it, worshiping and praying to it. °∞Rescue me!°± he says. °∞You are my god!°±
23Is 44:18 Such stupidity and ignorance! Their eyes are closed, and they cannot see. Their minds are shut, and they cannot think.
23Is 44:19 The person who made the idol never stops to reflect, °∞Why, it°Øs just a block of wood! I burned half of it for heat and used it to bake my bread and roast my meat. How can the rest of it be a god? Should I bow down to worship a piece of wood?°±
23Is 44:20 The poor, deluded fool feeds on ashes. He trusts something that can°Øt help him at all. Yet he cannot bring himself to ask, °∞Is this idol that I°Øm holding in my hand a lie?°±
23Is 44:21 °∞Pay attention, O Jacob, for you are my servant, O Israel. I, the Lord, made you, and I will not forget you.
23Is 44:22 I have swept away your sins like a cloud. I have scattered your offenses like the morning mist. Oh, return to me, for I have paid the price to set you free.°±
23Is 44:23 Sing, O heavens, for the Lord has done this wondrous thing. Shout for joy, O depths of the earth! Break into song, O mountains and forests and every tree! For the Lord has redeemed Jacob and is glorified in Israel.
23Is 44:24 This is what the Lord says - your Redeemer and Creator. °∞I am the Lord, who made all things. I alone stretched out the heavens. Who was with me when I made the earth?
23Is 44:25 I expose the false prophets as liars and make fools of fortune-tellers. I cause the wise to give bad advice, thus proving them to be fools.
23Is 44:26 But I carry out the predictions of my prophets! By them I say to Jerusalem, °ÆPeople will live here again,°Ø and to the towns of Judah, °ÆYou will be rebuilt; I will restore all your ruins!°Ø
23Is 44:27 When I speak to the rivers and say, °ÆDry up!°Ø they will be dry.
23Is 44:28 When I say of Cyrus, °ÆHe is my shepherd,°Ø he will certainly do as I say. He will command, °ÆRebuild Jerusalem°Ø; he will say, °ÆRestore the Temple.°Ø°±
23Is 45:1 This is what the Lord says to Cyrus, his anointed one, whose right hand he will empower. Before him, mighty kings will be paralyzed with fear. Their fortress gates will be opened, never to shut again.
23Is 45:2 This is what the Lord says. °∞I will go before you, Cyrus, and level the mountains®Á. I will smash down gates of bronze and cut through bars of iron. / ®ÁAs in Dead Sea Scrolls and Greek version; Masoretic Text reads the swellings
23Is 45:3 And I will give you treasures hidden in the darkness - secret riches. I will do this so you may know that I am the Lord, the God of Israel, the one who calls you by name.
23Is 45:4 °∞And why have I called you for this work? Why did I call you by name when you did not know me? It is for the sake of Jacob my servant, Israel my chosen one.
23Is 45:5 I am the Lord; there is no other God. I have equipped you for battle, though you don°Øt even know me,
23Is 45:6 so all the world from east to west will know there is no other God. I am the Lord, and there is no other.
23Is 45:7 I create the light and make the darkness. I send good times and bad times. I, the Lord, am the one who does these things.
23Is 45:8 °∞Open up, O heavens, and pour out your righteousness. Let the earth open wide so salvation and righteousness can sprout up together. I, the Lord, created them.
23Is 45:9 °∞What sorrow awaits those who argue with their Creator. Does a clay pot argue with its maker? Does the clay dispute with the one who shapes it, saying, °ÆStop, you°Øre doing it wrong!°Ø Does the pot exclaim, °ÆHow clumsy can you be?°Ø
23Is 45:10 How terrible it would be if a newborn baby said to its father, °ÆWhy was I born?°Ø or if it said to its mother, °ÆWhy did you make me this way?°Ø°±
23Is 45:11 This is what the Lord says - the Holy One of Israel and your Creator. °∞Do you question what I do for my children? Do you give me orders about the work of my hands?
23Is 45:12 I am the one who made the earth and created people to live on it. With my hands I stretched out the heavens. All the stars are at my command.
23Is 45:13 I will raise up Cyrus to fulfill my righteous purpose, and I will guide his actions. He will restore my city and free my captive people - without seeking a reward! I, the Lord of Heaven°Øs Armies, have spoken!°±
23Is 45:14 This is what the Lord says. °∞You will rule the Egyptians, the Ethiopians®Á, and the Sabeans. They will come to you with all their merchandise, and it will all be yours. They will follow you as prisoners in chains. They will fall to their knees in front of you and say, °ÆGod is with you, and he is the only God. There is no other.°Ø°± / ®ÁHebrew Cushites
23Is 45:15 Truly, O God of Israel, our Savior, you work in mysterious ways.
23Is 45:16 All craftsmen who make idols will be humiliated. They will all be disgraced together.
23Is 45:17 But the Lord will save the people of Israel with eternal salvation. Throughout everlasting ages, they will never again be humiliated and disgraced.
23Is 45:18 For the Lord is God, and he created the heavens and earth and put everything in place. He made the world to be lived in, not to be a place of empty chaos. °∞I am the Lord,°± he says, °∞and there is no other.
23Is 45:19 I publicly proclaim bold promises. I do not whisper obscurities in some dark corner. I would not have told the people of Israel®Á to seek me if I could not be found. I, the Lord, speak only what is true and declare only what is right. / ®ÁHebrew of Jacob. See note on 14.1
23Is 45:20 °∞Gather together and come, you fugitives from surrounding nations. What fools they are who carry around their wooden idols and pray to gods that cannot save!
23Is 45:21 Consult together, argue your case. Get together and decide what to say. Who made these things known so long ago? What idol ever told you they would happen? Was it not I, the Lord? For there is no other God but me, a righteous God and Savior. There is none but me.
23Is 45:22 Let all the world look to me for salvation! For I am God; there is no other.
23Is 45:23 I have sworn by my own name; I have spoken the truth, and I will never go back on my word. Every knee will bend to me, and every tongue will confess allegiance to me®Á.°± / ®ÁHebrew will confess; Greek version reads will confess and give praise to God. Compare Rom 14.11

23Is 45:25 In the Lord all the generations of Israel will be justified, and in him they will boast.
23Is 46:1 Bel and Nebo, the gods of Babylon, bow as they are lowered to the ground. They are being hauled away on ox carts. The poor beasts stagger under the weight.
23Is 46:2 Both the idols and their owners are bowed down. The gods cannot protect the people, and the people cannot protect the gods. They go off into captivity together.
23Is 46:3 °∞Listen to me, descendants of Jacob, all you who remain in Israel. I have cared for you since you were born. Yes, I carried you before you were born.

23Is 46:5 °∞To whom will you compare me? Who is my equal?

23Is 46:11 I will call a swift bird of prey from the east - a leader from a distant land to come and do my bidding. I have said what I would do, and I will do it.
23Is 46:12 °∞Listen to me, you stubborn people who are so far from doing right.
23Is 46:13 For I am ready to set things right, not in the distant future, but right now! I am ready to save Jerusalem®Á and show my glory to Israel. / ®ÁHebrew Zion

23Is 47:5 °∞O beautiful Babylon, sit now in darkness and silence. Never again will you be known as the queen of kingdoms.
23Is 47:6 For I was angry with my chosen people and punished them by letting them fall into your hands. But you, Babylon, showed them no mercy. You oppressed even the elderly.
23Is 47:7 You said, °ÆI will reign forever as queen of the world!°Ø You did not reflect on your actions or think about their consequences.
23Is 47:8 °∞Listen to this, you pleasure-loving kingdom, living at ease and feeling secure. You say, °ÆI am the only one, and there is no other. I will never be a widow or lose my children.°Ø

23Is 47:10 °∞You felt secure in your wickedness. °ÆNo one sees me,°Ø you said. But your °Æwisdom°Ø and °Æknowledge°Ø have led you astray, and you said, °ÆI am the only one, and there is no other.°Ø
23Is 47:11 So disaster will overtake you, and you won°Øt be able to charm it away. Calamity will fall upon you, and you won°Øt be able to buy your way out. A catastrophe will strike you suddenly, one for which you are not prepared.
23Is 47:12 °∞Now use your magical charms! Use the spells you have worked at all these years! Maybe they will do you some good. Maybe they can make someone afraid of you.
23Is 47:13 All the advice you receive has made you tired. Where are all your astrologers, those stargazers who make predictions each month? Let them stand up and save you from what the future holds.
23Is 47:14 But they are like straw burning in a fire; they cannot save themselves from the flame. You will get no help from them at all; their hearth is no place to sit for warmth.

23Is 48:1 °∞Listen to me, O family of Jacob, you who are called by the name of Israel and born into the family of Judah. Listen, you who take oaths in the name of the Lord and call on the God of Israel. You don°Øt keep your promises,

23Is 48:5 That is why I told you what would happen; I told you beforehand what I was going to do. Then you could never say, °ÆMy idols did it. My wooden image and metal god commanded it to happen!°Ø
23Is 48:6 You have heard my predictions and seen them fulfilled, but you refuse to admit it. Now I will tell you new things, secrets you have not yet heard.
23Is 48:7 They are brand new, not things from the past. So you cannot say, °ÆWe knew that all the time!°Ø
23Is 48:8 °∞Yes, I will tell you of things that are entirely new, things you never heard of before. For I know so well what traitors you are. You have been rebels from birth.
23Is 48:9 Yet for my own sake and for the honor of my name, I will hold back my anger and not wipe you out.
23Is 48:10 I have refined you, but not as silver is refined. Rather, I have refined you in the furnace of suffering.

23Is 48:18 Oh, that you had listened to my commands! Then you would have had peace flowing like a gentle river and righteousness rolling over you like waves in the sea.

23Is 49:3 He said to me, °∞You are my servant, Israel, and you will bring me glory.°±

23Is 49:15 °∞Never! Can a mother forget her nursing child? Can she feel no love for the child she has borne? But even if that were possible, I would not forget you!
23Is 49:16 See, I have written your name on the palms of my hands. Always in my mind is a picture of Jerusalem°Øs walls in ruins.
23Is 49:17 Soon your descendants will come back, and all who are trying to destroy you will go away.

23Is 49:21 Then you will think to yourself, °ÆWho has given me all these descendants? For most of my children were killed, and the rest were carried away into exile. I was left here all alone. Where did all these people come from? Who bore these children? Who raised them for me?°Ø°±

23Is 50:2 Why was no one there when I came? Why didn°Øt anyone answer when I called? Is it because I have no power to rescue? No, that is not the reason! For I can speak to the sea and make it dry up! I can turn rivers into deserts covered with dying fish.

23Is 57:6 Your gods are the smooth stones in the valleys. You worship them with liquid offerings and grain offerings. They, not I, are your inheritance. Do you think all this makes me happy?
23Is 57:7 You have committed adultery on every high mountain. There you have worshiped idols and have been unfaithful to me.
23Is 57:8 You have put pagan symbols on your doorposts and behind your doors. You have left me and climbed into bed with these detestable gods. You have committed yourselves to them. You love to look at their naked bodies.
23Is 57:9 You have given olive oil to Molech®Á with many gifts of perfume. You have traveled far, even into the world of the dead®Ë, to find new gods to love. / ®ÁOr to the king. ®ËHebrew into Sheol
23Is 57:10 You grew weary in your search, but you never gave up. Desire gave you renewed strength, and you did not grow weary.
23Is 57:11 °∞Are you afraid of these idols? Do they terrify you? Is that why you have lied to me and forgotten me and my words? Is it because of my long silence that you no longer fear me?
23Is 57:12 Now I will expose your so-called good deeds. None of them will help you.
23Is 57:13 Let°Øs see if your idols can save you when you cry to them for help. Why, a puff of wind can knock them down! If you just breathe on them, they fall over! But whoever trusts in me will inherit the land and possess my holy mountain.°±
23Is 57:14 God says, °∞Rebuild the road! Clear away the rocks and stones so my people can return from captivity.°±
23Is 57:15 The high and lofty one who lives in eternity, the Holy One, says this. °∞I live in the high and holy place with those whose spirits are contrite and humble. I restore the crushed spirit of the humble and revive the courage of those with repentant hearts.
23Is 57:16 For I will not fight against you forever; I will not always be angry. If I were, all people would pass away - all the souls I have made.
23Is 57:17 I was angry, so I punished these greedy people. I withdrew from them, but they kept going on their own stubborn way.
23Is 57:18 I have seen what they do, but I will heal them anyway! I will lead them. I will comfort those who mourn, 
23Is 57:19 bringing words of praise to their lips. May they have abundant peace, both near and far,°± says the Lord, who heals them.
23Is 57:20 °∞But those who still reject me are like the restless sea, which is never still but continually churns up mud and dirt.
23Is 57:21 There is no peace for the wicked,°± says my God.
23Is 58:1 °∞Shout with the voice of a trumpet blast. Shout aloud! Don°Øt be timid. Tell my people Israel®Á of their sins! / ®ÁHebrew Jacob. See note on 14.1
23Is 58:2 Yet they act so pious! They come to the Temple every day and seem delighted to learn all about me. They act like a righteous nation that would never abandon the laws of its God. They ask me to take action on their behalf, pretending they want to be near me.
23Is 58:3 °ÆWe have fasted before you!°Ø they say. °ÆWhy aren°Øt you impressed? We have been very hard on ourselves, and you don°Øt even notice it!°Ø °∞I will tell you why!°± I respond. °∞It°Øs because you are fasting to please yourselves. Even while you fast, you keep oppressing your workers.
23Is 58:4 What good is fasting when you keep on fighting and quarreling? This kind of fasting will never get you anywhere with me.
23Is 58:5 You humble yourselves by going through the motions of penance, bowing your heads like reeds bending in the wind. You dress in burlap and cover yourselves with ashes. Is this what you call fasting? Do you really think this will please the Lord?
23Is 58:6 °∞No, this is the kind of fasting I want. Free those who are wrongly imprisoned; lighten the burden of those who work for you. Let the oppressed go free, and remove the chains that bind people.
23Is 58:7 Share your food with the hungry, and give shelter to the homeless. Give clothes to those who need them, and do not hide from relatives who need your help.
23Is 58:8 °∞Then your salvation will come like the dawn, and your wounds will quickly heal. Your godliness will lead you forward, and the glory of the Lord will protect you from behind.
23Is 58:9 Then when you call, the Lord will answer. °ÆYes, I am here,°Ø he will quickly reply. °∞Remove the heavy yoke of oppression. Stop pointing your finger and spreading vicious rumors!
23Is 58:10 Feed the hungry, and help those in trouble. Then your light will shine out from the darkness, and the darkness around you will be as bright as noon.
23Is 58:11 The Lord will guide you continually, giving you water when you are dry and restoring your strength. You will be like a well-watered garden, like an ever-flowing spring.
23Is 58:12 Some of you will rebuild the deserted ruins of your cities. Then you will be known as a rebuilder of walls and a restorer of homes.
23Is 58:13 °∞Keep the Sabbath day holy. Don°Øt pursue your own interests on that day, but enjoy the Sabbath and speak of it with delight as the Lord°Øs holy day. Honor the Sabbath in everything you do on that day, and don°Øt follow your own desires or talk idly.
23Is 58:14 Then the Lord will be your delight. I will give you great honor and satisfy you with the inheritance I promised to your ancestor Jacob. I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
23Is 59:1 Listen! The Lord°Øs arm is not too weak to save you, nor is his ear too deaf to hear you call.
23Is 59:2 It°Øs your sins that have cut you off from God. Because of your sins, he has turned away and will not listen anymore.
23Is 59:3 Your hands are the hands of murderers, and your fingers are filthy with sin. Your lips are full of lies, and your mouth spews corruption.
23Is 59:4 No one cares about being fair and honest. The people°Øs lawsuits are based on lies. They conceive evil deeds and then give birth to sin.
23Is 59:5 They hatch deadly snakes and weave spiders°Ø webs. Whoever falls into their webs will die, and there°Øs danger even in getting near them.
23Is 59:6 Their webs can°Øt be made into clothing, and nothing they do is productive. All their activity is filled with sin, and violence is their trademark.
23Is 59:7 Their feet run to do evil, and they rush to commit murder. They think only about sinning. Misery and destruction always follow them.
23Is 59:8 They don°Øt know where to find peace or what it means to be just and good. They have mapped out crooked roads, and no one who follows them knows a moment°Øs peace.
23Is 59:9 So there is no justice among us, and we know nothing about right living. We look for light but find only darkness. We look for bright skies but walk in gloom.
23Is 59:10 We grope like the blind along a wall, feeling our way like people without eyes. Even at brightest noontime, we stumble as though it were dark. Among the living, we are like the dead.
23Is 59:11 We growl like hungry bears; we moan like mournful doves. We look for justice, but it never comes. We look for rescue, but it is far away from us.
23Is 59:12 For our sins are piled up before God and testify against us. Yes, we know what sinners we are.
23Is 59:13 We know we have rebelled and have denied the Lord. We have turned our backs on our God. We know how unfair and oppressive we have been, carefully planning our deceitful lies.
23Is 59:14 Our courts oppose the righteous, and justice is nowhere to be found. Truth stumbles in the streets, and honesty has been outlawed.
23Is 59:15 Yes, truth is gone, and anyone who renounces evil is attacked. The Lord looked and was displeased to find there was no justice.
23Is 59:16 He was amazed to see that no one intervened to help the oppressed. So he himself stepped in to save them with his strong arm, and his justice sustained him.
23Is 59:17 He put on righteousness as his body armor and placed the helmet of salvation on his head. He clothed himself with a robe of vengeance and wrapped himself in a cloak of divine passion.
23Is 59:18 He will repay his enemies for their evil deeds. His fury will fall on his foes. He will pay them back even to the ends of the earth.
23Is 59:19 In the west, people will respect the name of the Lord; in the east, they will glorify him. For he will come like a raging flood tide driven by the breath of the Lord®Á. / ®ÁOr When the enemy comes like a raging flood tide, / the Spirit of the Lord will drive him back
23Is 59:20 °∞The Redeemer will come to Jerusalem to buy back those in Israel who have turned from their sins,°±®Á says the Lord. / ®ÁHebrew The Redeemer will come to Zion / to buy back those in Jacob who have turned from their sins. Greek version reads The one who rescues will come on behalf of Zion, and he will turn Jacob away from ungodliness. Compare Rom 11.26
23Is 59:21 °∞And this is my covenant with them,°± says the Lord. °∞My Spirit will not leave them, and neither will these words I have given you. They will be on your lips and on the lips of your children and your children°Øs children forever. I, the Lord, have spoken!
23Is 60:1 °∞Arise, Jerusalem! Let your light shine for all to see. For the glory of the Lord rises to shine on you.

23Is 60:7 The flocks of Kedar will be given to you, and the rams of Nebaioth will be brought for my altars. I will accept their offerings, and I will make my Temple glorious.
23Is 60:8 °∞And what do I see flying like clouds to Israel, like doves to their nests?
23Is 60:9 They are ships from the ends of the earth, from lands that trust in me, led by the great ships of Tarshish. They are bringing the people of Israel home from far away, carrying their silver and gold. They will honor the Lord your God, the Holy One of Israel, for he has filled you with splendor.
23Is 60:10 °∞Foreigners will come to rebuild your towns, and their kings will serve you. For though I have destroyed you in my anger, I will now have mercy on you through my grace.
23Is 60:11 Your gates will stay open around the clock to receive the wealth of many lands. The kings of the world will be led as captives in a victory procession.
23Is 60:12 For the nations that refuse to serve you will be destroyed.
23Is 60:13 °∞The glory of Lebanon will be yours - the forests of cypress, fir, and pine - to beautify my sanctuary. My Temple will be glorious!
23Is 60:14 The descendants of your tormentors will come and bow before you. Those who despised you will kiss your feet. They will call you the City of the Lord, and Zion of the Holy One of Israel.
23Is 60:15 °∞Though you were once despised and hated, with no one traveling through you, I will make you beautiful forever, a joy to all generations.
23Is 60:16 Powerful kings and mighty nations will satisfy your every need, as though you were a child nursing at the breast of a queen. You will know at last that I, the Lord, am your Savior and your Redeemer, the Mighty One of Israel®Á. / ®ÁHebrew of Jacob. See note on 14.1

23Is 60:18 Violence will disappear from your land; the desolation and destruction of war will end. Salvation will surround you like city walls, and praise will be on the lips of all who enter there.
23Is 60:19 °∞No longer will you need the sun to shine by day, nor the moon to give its light by night, for the Lord your God will be your everlasting light, and your God will be your glory.
23Is 60:20 Your sun will never set; your moon will not go down. For the Lord will be your everlasting light. Your days of mourning will come to an end.
23Is 60:21 All your people will be righteous. They will possess their land forever, for I will plant them there with my own hands in order to bring myself glory.
23Is 60:22 The smallest family will become a thousand people, and the tiniest group will become a mighty nation. At the right time, I, the Lord, will make it happen.°±
23Is 61:1 The Spirit of the Sovereign Lord is upon me, for the Lord has anointed me to bring good news to the poor. He has sent me to comfort the brokenhearted and to proclaim that captives will be released and prisoners will be freed®Á. / ®ÁGreek version reads and the blind will see. Compare Luke 4.18
23Is 61:2 He has sent me to tell those who mourn that the time of the Lord°Øs favor has come®Á, and with it, the day of God°Øs anger against their enemies. / ®ÁOr to proclaim the acceptable year of the Lord
23Is 61:3 To all who mourn in Israel®Á, he will give a crown of beauty for ashes, a joyous blessing instead of mourning, festive praise instead of despair. In their righteousness, they will be like great oaks that the Lord has planted for his own glory. / ®ÁHebrew in Zion
23Is 61:4 They will rebuild the ancient ruins, repairing cities destroyed long ago. They will revive them, though they have been deserted for many generations.
23Is 61:5 Foreigners will be your servants. They will feed your flocks and plow your fields and tend your vineyards.
23Is 61:6 You will be called priests of the Lord, ministers of our God. You will feed on the treasures of the nations and boast in their riches.
23Is 61:7 Instead of shame and dishonor, you will enjoy a double share of honor. You will possess a double portion of prosperity in your land, and everlasting joy will be yours.
23Is 61:8 °∞For I, the Lord, love justice. I hate robbery and wrongdoing. I will faithfully reward my people for their suffering and make an everlasting covenant with them.

23Is 62:1 Because I love Zion, I will not keep still. Because my heart yearns for Jerusalem, I cannot remain silent. I will not stop praying for her until her righteousness shines like the dawn, and her salvation blazes like a burning torch.
23Is 62:2 The nations will see your righteousness. World leaders will be blinded by your glory. And you will be given a new name by the Lord°Øs own mouth.
23Is 62:3 The Lord will hold you in his hand for all to see - a splendid crown in the hand of God.
23Is 62:4 Never again will you be called °∞The Forsaken City°±®Á or °∞The Desolate Land.°±®Ë Your new name will be °∞The City of God°Øs Delight°±®È and °∞The Bride of God,°±®Í for the Lord delights in you and will claim you as his bride. / ®ÁHebrew Azubah, which means °∞forsaken.°±®ËHebrew Shemamah, which means °∞desolate.°± ®ÈHebrew Hephzibah, which means °∞my delight is in her.°± ®ÍHebrew Beulah, which means °∞married.°±

23Is 62:8 The Lord has sworn to Jerusalem by his own strength. °∞I will never again hand you over to your enemies. Never again will foreign warriors come and take away your grain and new wine.
23Is 62:9 You raised the grain, and you will eat it, praising the Lord. Within the courtyards of the Temple, you yourselves will drink the wine you have pressed.°±
23Is 62:10 Go out through the gates! Prepare the highway for my people to return! Smooth out the road; pull out the boulders; raise a flag for all the nations to see.
23Is 62:11 The Lord has sent this message to every land. °∞Tell the people of Israel®Á, °ÆLook, your Savior is coming. See, he brings his reward with him as he comes.°Ø°± / ®ÁHebrew Tell the daughter of Zion
23Is 62:12 They will be called °∞The Holy People°± and °∞The People Redeemed by the Lord.°± And Jerusalem will be known as °∞The Desirable Place°± and °∞The City No Longer Forsaken.°±
23Is 63:1 Who is this who comes from Edom, from the city of Bozrah, with his clothing stained red? Who is this in royal robes, marching in his great strength? °∞It is I, the Lord, announcing your salvation! It is I, the Lord, who has the power to save!°±
23Is 63:2 Why are your clothes so red, as if you have been treading out grapes?
23Is 63:3 °∞I have been treading the winepress alone; no one was there to help me. In my anger I have trampled my enemies as if they were grapes. In my fury I have trampled my foes. Their blood has stained my clothes.
23Is 63:4 For the time has come for me to avenge my people, to ransom them from their oppressors.
23Is 63:5 I was amazed to see that no one intervened to help the oppressed. So I myself stepped in to save them with my strong arm, and my wrath sustained me.
23Is 63:6 I crushed the nations in my anger and made them stagger and fall to the ground, spilling their blood upon the earth.°±
23Is 63:7 I will tell of the Lord°Øs unfailing love. I will praise the Lord for all he has done. I will rejoice in his great goodness to Israel, which he has granted according to his mercy and love.

23Is 63:9 In all their suffering he also suffered, and he personally®Á rescued them. In his love and mercy he redeemed them. He lifted them up and carried them through all the years. / ®ÁHebrew and the angel of his presence
23Is 63:10 But they rebelled against him and grieved his Holy Spirit. So he became their enemy and fought against them.
23Is 63:11 Then they remembered those days of old when Moses led his people out of Egypt. They cried out, °∞Where is the one who brought Israel through the sea, with Moses as their shepherd? Where is the one who sent his Holy Spirit to be among his people?
23Is 63:12 Where is the one whose power was displayed when Moses lifted up his hand - the one who divided the sea before them, making himself famous forever?
23Is 63:13 Where is the one who led them through the bottom of the sea? They were like fine stallions racing through the desert, never stumbling.
23Is 63:14 As with cattle going down into a peaceful valley, the Spirit of the Lord gave them rest. You led your people, Lord, and gained a magnificent reputation.°±
23Is 63:15 Lord, look down from heaven; look from your holy, glorious home, and see us. Where is the passion and the might you used to show on our behalf? Where are your mercy and compassion now?
23Is 63:16 Surely you are still our Father! Even if Abraham and Jacob®Á would disown us, Lord, you would still be our Father. You are our Redeemer from ages past. / ®ÁHebrew Israel. See note on 14.1
23Is 63:17 Lord, why have you allowed us to turn from your path? Why have you given us stubborn hearts so we no longer fear you? Return and help us, for we are your servants, the tribes that are your special possession.
23Is 63:18 How briefly your holy people possessed your holy place, and now our enemies have destroyed it.
23Is 63:19 Sometimes it seems as though we never belonged to you, as though we had never been known as your people.

23Is 64:2 ®ÁAs fire causes wood to burn and water to boil, your coming would make the nations tremble. Then your enemies would learn the reason for your fame! / ®ÁVerses 64.2-12 are numbered 64.1-11 in Hebrew text
23Is 64:3 When you came down long ago, you did awesome deeds beyond our highest expectations. And oh, how the mountains quaked!
23Is 64:4 For since the world began, no ear has heard, and no eye has seen a God like you, who works for those who wait for him!
23Is 64:5 You welcome those who gladly do good, who follow godly ways. But you have been very angry with us, for we are not godly. We are constant sinners; how can people like us be saved?
23Is 64:6 We are all infected and impure with sin. When we display our righteous deeds, they are nothing but filthy rags. Like autumn leaves, we wither and fall, and our sins sweep us away like the wind.
23Is 64:7 Yet no one calls on your name or pleads with you for mercy. Therefore, you have turned away from us and turned us over®Á to our sins. / ®ÁAs in Greek, Syriac, and Aramaic versions; Hebrew reads melted us
23Is 64:8 And yet, O Lord, you are our Father. We are the clay, and you are the potter. We all are formed by your hand.
23Is 64:9 Don°Øt be so angry with us, Lord. Please don°Øt remember our sins forever. Look at us, we pray, and see that we are all your people.
23Is 64:10 Your holy cities are destroyed. Zion is a wilderness; yes, Jerusalem is a desolate ruin.
23Is 64:11 The holy and beautiful Temple where our ancestors praised you has been burned down, and all the things of beauty are destroyed.
23Is 64:12 After all this, Lord, must you still refuse to help us? Will you continue to be silent and punish us?
23Is 65:1 The Lord says, °∞I was ready to respond, but no one asked for help. I was ready to be found, but no one was looking for me. I said, °ÆHere I am, here I am!°Ø to a nation that did not call on my name®Á. / ®ÁOr to a nation that did not bear my name
23Is 65:2 All day long I opened my arms to a rebellious people®Á. But they follow their own evil paths and their own crooked schemes. / ®ÁGreek version reads I was found by people who were not looking for me. I showed myself to those who were not asking for me. / All day long I opened my arms to them, / but they were disobedient and rebellious. Compare Rom 10.20
23Is 65:3 All day long they insult me to my face by worshiping idols in their sacred gardens. They burn incense on pagan altars.
23Is 65:4 At night they go out among the graves, worshiping the dead. They eat the flesh of pigs and make stews with other forbidden foods.
23Is 65:5 Yet they say to each other, °ÆDon°Øt come too close or you will defile me! I am holier than you!°Ø These people are a stench in my nostrils, an acrid smell that never goes away.
23Is 65:6 °∞Look, my decree is written out®Á in front of me. I will not stand silent; I will repay them in full! Yes, I will repay them - / ®ÁOr their sins are written out; Hebrew reads it stands written
23Is 65:7 both for their own sins and for those of their ancestors,°± says the Lord. °∞For they also burned incense on the mountains and insulted me on the hills. I will pay them back in full!
23Is 65:8 °∞But I will not destroy them all,°± says the Lord. °∞For just as good grapes are found among a cluster of bad ones (and someone will say, °ÆDon°Øt throw them all away - some of those grapes are good!°Ø), so I will not destroy all Israel. For I still have true servants there.
23Is 65:9 I will preserve a remnant of the people of Israel®Á and of Judah to possess my land. Those I choose will inherit it, and my servants will live there. / ®ÁHebrew remnant of Jacob. See note on 14.1
23Is 65:10 The plain of Sharon will again be filled with flocks for my people who have searched for me, and the valley of Achor will be a place to pasture herds.
23Is 65:11 °∞But because the rest of you have forsaken the Lord and have forgotten his Temple, and because you have prepared feasts to honor the god of Fate and have offered mixed wine to the god of Destiny,
23Is 65:12 now I will °Ædestine°Ø you for the sword. All of you will bow down before the executioner. For when I called, you did not answer. When I spoke, you did not listen. You deliberately sinned - before my very eyes - and chose to do what you know I despise.°±
23Is 65:13 Therefore, this is what the Sovereign Lord says. °∞My servants will eat, but you will starve. My servants will drink, but you will be thirsty. My servants will rejoice, but you will be sad and ashamed.
23Is 65:14 My servants will sing for joy, but you will cry in sorrow and despair.
23Is 65:15 Your name will be a curse word among my people, for the Sovereign Lord will destroy you and will call his true servants by another name.
23Is 65:16 All who invoke a blessing or take an oath will do so by the God of truth. For I will put aside my anger and forget the evil of earlier days.
23Is 65:17 °∞Look! I am creating new heavens and a new earth, and no one will even think about the old ones anymore.
23Is 65:18 Be glad; rejoice forever in my creation! And look! I will create Jerusalem as a place of happiness. Her people will be a source of joy.
23Is 65:19 I will rejoice over Jerusalem and delight in my people. And the sound of weeping and crying will be heard in it no more.
23Is 65:20 °∞No longer will babies die when only a few days old. No longer will adults die before they have lived a full life. No longer will people be considered old at one hundred! Only the cursed will die that young!
23Is 65:21 In those days people will live in the houses they build and eat the fruit of their own vineyards.
23Is 65:22 Unlike the past, invaders will not take their houses and confiscate their vineyards. For my people will live as long as trees, and my chosen ones will have time to enjoy their hard-won gains.
23Is 65:23 They will not work in vain, and their children will not be doomed to misfortune. For they are people blessed by the Lord, and their children, too, will be blessed.
23Is 65:24 I will answer them before they even call to me. While they are still talking about their needs, I will go ahead and answer their prayers!
23Is 65:25 The wolf and the lamb will feed together. The lion will eat hay like a cow. But the snakes will eat dust. In those days no one will be hurt or destroyed on my holy mountain. I, the Lord, have spoken!°±
23Is 66:1 This is what the Lord says£∫ °∞Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. Could you build me a temple as good as that? Could you build me such a resting place?
23Is 66:2 My hands have made both heaven and earth; they and everything in them are mine®Á. I, the Lord, have spoken! °∞I will bless those who have humble and contrite hearts, who tremble at my word. / ®ÁAs in Greek, Latin, and Syriac versions; Hebrew reads these things are
23Is 66:3 But those who choose their own ways - delighting in their detestable sins - will not have their offerings accepted. When such people sacrifice a bull, it is no more acceptable than a human sacrifice. When they sacrifice a lamb, it°Øs as though they had sacrificed a dog! When they bring an offering of grain, they might as well offer the blood of a pig. When they burn frankincense, it°Øs as if they had blessed an idol.
23Is 66:4 I will send them great trouble - all the things they feared. For when I called, they did not answer. When I spoke, they did not listen. They deliberately sinned before my very eyes and chose to do what they know I despise.°±
23Is 66:5 Hear this message from the Lord, all you who tremble at his words. °∞Your own people hate you and throw you out for being loyal to my name. °ÆLet the Lord be honored!°Ø they scoff. °ÆBe joyful in him!°Ø But they will be put to shame.
23Is 66:6 What is all the commotion in the city? What is that terrible noise from the Temple? It is the voice of the Lord taking vengeance against his enemies.
