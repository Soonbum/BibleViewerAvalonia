111Kg 1:1 King David was now very old, and no matter how many blankets covered him, he could not keep warm.
111Kg 1:2 So his advisers told him, "Let us find a young virgin to wait on you and look after you, my lord. She will lie in your arms and keep you warm."
111Kg 1:3 So they searched throughout the land of Israel for a beautiful girl, and they found Abishag from Shunem and brought her to the king.
111Kg 1:4 The girl was very beautiful, and she looked after the king and took care of him. But the king had no sexual relations with her.
111Kg 1:5 About that time David's son Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, began boasting, "I will make myself king." So he provided himself with chariots and charioteers and recruited fifty men to run in front of him.
111Kg 1:6 Now his father, King David, had never disciplined him at any time, even by asking, "Why are you doing that?" Adonijah had been born next after Absalom, and he was very handsome.
111Kg 1:7 Adonijah took Joab son of Zeruiah and Abiathar the priest into his confidence, and they agreed to help him become king.
111Kg 1:8 But Zadok the priest, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's personal bodyguard refused to support Adonijah.
111Kg 1:9 Adonijah went to the Stone of Zoheleth�� near the spring of En-rogel, where he sacrificed sheep, cattle, and fattened calves. He invited all his brothers - the other sons of King David - and all the royal officials of Judah. / ��Or to the Serpent's Stone; Greek version supports reading Zoheleth as a proper name
111Kg 1:10 But he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the king's bodyguard or his brother Solomon.
111Kg 1:11 Then Nathan went to Bathsheba, Solomon's mother, and asked her, "Haven't you heard that Haggith's son, Adonijah, has made himself king, and our lord David doesn't even know about it?
111Kg 1:12 If you want to save your own life and the life of your son Solomon, follow my advice.
111Kg 1:13 Go at once to King David and say to him, 'My lord the king, didn't you make a vow and say to me, "Your son Solomon will surely be the next king and will sit on my throne"? Why then has Adonijah become king?'
111Kg 1:14 And while you are still talking with him, I will come and confirm everything you have said."
111Kg 1:15 So Bathsheba went into the king's bedroom. (He was very old now, and Abishag was taking care of him.)
111Kg 1:16 Bathsheba bowed down before the king. "What can I do for you?" he asked her.
111Kg 1:17 She replied, "My lord, you made a vow before the LORD your God when you said to me, 'Your son Solomon will surely be the next king and will sit on my throne.'
111Kg 1:18 But instead, Adonijah has made himself king, and my lord the king does not even know about it.
111Kg 1:19 He has sacrificed many cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and he has invited all the king's sons to attend the celebration. He also invited Abiathar the priest and Joab, the commander of the army. But he did not invite your servant Solomon.
111Kg 1:20 And now, my lord the king, all Israel is waiting for you to announce who will become king after you.
111Kg 1:21 If you do not act, my son Solomon and I will be treated as criminals as soon as my lord the king has died."
111Kg 1:22 While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet arrived.
111Kg 1:23 The king's officials told him, "Nathan the prophet is here to see you." Nathan went in and bowed before the king with his face to the ground.
111Kg 1:24 Nathan asked, "My lord the king, have you decided that Adonijah will be the next king and that he will sit on your throne?
111Kg 1:25 Today he has sacrificed many cattle, fattened calves, and sheep, and he has invited all the king's sons to attend the celebration. He also invited the commanders of the army and Abiathar the priest. They are feasting and drinking with him and shouting, 'Long live King Adonijah!'
111Kg 1:26 But he did not invite me or Zadok the priest or Benaiah or your servant Solomon.
111Kg 1:27 Has my lord the king really done this without letting any of his officials know who should be the next king?"
111Kg 1:28 King David responded, "Call Bathsheba!" So she came back in and stood before the king.
111Kg 1:29 And the king repeated his vow�� "As surely as the LORD lives, who has rescued me from every danger,
111Kg 1:30 your son Solomon will be the next king and will sit on my throne this very day, just as I vowed to you before the LORD, the God of Israel."
111Kg 1:31 Then Bathsheba bowed down with her face to the ground before the king and exclaimed, "May my lord King David live forever!"
111Kg 1:32 Then King David ordered, "Call Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada." When they came into the king's presence,
111Kg 1:33 the king said to them, "Take Solomon and my officials down to Gihon Spring. Solomon is to ride on my own mule.
111Kg 1:34 There Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet are to anoint him king over Israel. Blow the ram's horn and shout, 'Long live King Solomon!'
111Kg 1:35 Then escort him back here, and he will sit on my throne. He will succeed me as king, for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and Judah."
111Kg 1:36 "Amen!" Benaiah son of Jehoiada replied. "May the LORD, the God of my lord the king, decree that it happen.
111Kg 1:37 And may the LORD be with Solomon as he has been with you, my lord the king, and may he make Solomon's reign even greater than yours!"
111Kg 1:38 So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Benaiah son of Jehoiada, and the king's bodyguard�� took Solomon down to Gihon Spring, with Solomon riding on King David's own mule. / ��Hebrew the Kerethites and Pelethites; also in 1.44
111Kg 1:39 There Zadok the priest took the flask of olive oil from the sacred tent and anointed Solomon with the oil. Then they sounded the ram's horn and all the people shouted, "Long live King Solomon!"
111Kg 1:40 And all the people followed Solomon into Jerusalem, playing flutes and shouting for joy. The celebration was so joyous and noisy that the earth shook with the sound.
111Kg 1:41 Adonijah and his guests heard the celebrating and shouting just as they were finishing their banquet. When Joab heard the sound of the ram's horn, he asked, "What's going on? Why is the city in such an uproar?"
111Kg 1:42 And while he was still speaking, Jonathan son of Abiathar the priest arrived. "Come in," Adonijah said to him, "for you are a good man. You must have good news."
111Kg 1:43 "Not at all!" Jonathan replied. "Our lord King David has just declared Solomon king!
111Kg 1:44 The king sent him down to Gihon Spring with Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada, protected by the king's bodyguard. They had him ride on the king's own mule,
111Kg 1:45 and Zadok and Nathan have anointed him at Gihon Spring as the new king. They have just returned, and the whole city is celebrating and rejoicing. That's what all the noise is about.
111Kg 1:46 What's more, Solomon is now sitting on the royal throne as king.
111Kg 1:47 And all the royal officials have gone to King David and congratulated him, saying, 'May your God make Solomon's fame even greater than your own, and may Solomon's reign be even greater than yours!' Then the king bowed his head in worship as he lay in his bed,
111Kg 1:48 and he said, 'Praise the LORD, the God of Israel, who today has chosen a successor to sit on my throne while I am still alive to see it.'"
111Kg 1:49 Then all of Adonijah's guests jumped up in panic from the banquet table and quickly scattered.
111Kg 1:50 Adonijah was afraid of Solomon, so he rushed to the sacred tent and grabbed onto the horns of the altar.
111Kg 1:51 Word soon reached Solomon that Adonijah had seized the horns of the altar in fear, and that he was pleading, "Let King Solomon swear today that he will not kill me!"
111Kg 1:52 Solomon replied, "If he proves himself to be loyal, not a hair on his head will be touched. But if he makes trouble, he will die."
111Kg 1:53 So King Solomon summoned Adonijah, and they brought him down from the altar. He came and bowed respectfully before King Solomon, who dismissed him, saying, "Go on home."
111Kg 2:1 As the time of King David's death approached, he gave this charge to his son Solomon.
111Kg 2:2 "I am going where everyone on earth must someday go. Take courage and be a man.
111Kg 2:3 Observe the requirements of the LORD your God, and follow all his ways. Keep the decrees, commands, regulations, and laws written in the Law of Moses so that you will be successful in all you do and wherever you go.
111Kg 2:4 If you do this, then the LORD will keep the promise he made to me. He told me, 'If your descendants live as they should and follow me faithfully with all their heart and soul, one of them will always sit on the throne of Israel.'
111Kg 2:5 "And there is something else. You know what Joab son of Zeruiah did to me when he murdered my two army commanders, Abner son of Ner and Amasa son of Jether. He pretended that it was an act of war, but it was done in a time of peace��, staining his belt and sandals with innocent blood��. / ��Or He murdered them during a time of peace as revenge for deaths they had caused in time of war ��As in some Greek and Old Latin manuscripts; Hebrew reads with the blood of war
111Kg 2:6 Do with him what you think best, but don't let him grow old and go to his grave in peace��. / ��Hebrew don't let his white head go down to Sheol in peace
111Kg 2:7 "Be kind to the sons of Barzillai of Gilead. Make them permanent guests at your table, for they took care of me when I fled from your brother Absalom.
111Kg 2:8 "And remember Shimei son of Gera, the man from Bahurim in Benjamin. He cursed me with a terrible curse as I was fleeing to Mahanaim. When he came down to meet me at the Jordan River, I swore by the LORD that I would not kill him.
111Kg 2:9 But that oath does not make him innocent. You are a wise man, and you will know how to arrange a bloody death for him��." / ��Hebrew how to bring his white head down to Sheol in blood
111Kg 2:10 Then David died and was buried with his ancestors in the City of David.
111Kg 2:11 David had reigned over Israel for forty years, seven of them in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.
111Kg 2:12 Solomon became king and sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established.
111Kg 2:13 One day Adonijah, whose mother was Haggith, came to see Bathsheba, Solomon's mother. "Have you come with peaceful intentions?" she asked him."Yes," he said, "I come in peace.
111Kg 2:14 In fact, I have a favor to ask of you." "What is it?" she asked.
111Kg 2:15 He replied, "As you know, the kingdom was rightfully mine; all Israel wanted me to be the next king. But the tables were turned, and the kingdom went to my brother instead; for that is the way the LORD wanted it.
111Kg 2:16 So now I have just one favor to ask of you. Please don't turn me down." "What is it?" she asked.
111Kg 2:17 He replied, "Speak to King Solomon on my behalf, for I know he will do anything you request. Ask him to let me marry Abishag, the girl from Shunem."
111Kg 2:18 "All right," Bathsheba replied. "I will speak to the king for you."
111Kg 2:19 So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak on Adonijah's behalf. The king rose from his throne to meet her, and he bowed down before her. When he sat down on his throne again, the king ordered that a throne be brought for his mother, and she sat at his right hand.
111Kg 2:20 "I have one small request to make of you," she said. "I hope you won't turn me down." "What is it, my mother?" he asked. "You know I won't refuse you."
111Kg 2:21 "Then let your brother Adonijah marry Abishag, the girl from Shunem," she replied.
111Kg 2:22 "How can you possibly ask me to give Abishag to Adonijah?" King Solomon demanded. "You might as well ask me to give him the kingdom! You know that he is my older brother, and that he has Abiathar the priest and Joab son of Zeruiah on his side."
111Kg 2:23 Then King Solomon made a vow before the LORD�� "May God strike me and even kill me if Adonijah has not sealed his fate with this request.
111Kg 2:24 The LORD has confirmed me and placed me on the throne of my father, David; he has established my dynasty as he promised. So as surely as the LORD lives, Adonijah will die this very day!"
111Kg 2:25 So King Solomon ordered Benaiah son of Jehoiada to execute him, and Adonijah was put to death.
111Kg 2:26 Then the king said to Abiathar the priest, "Go back to your home in Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I will not kill you now, because you carried the Ark of the Sovereign LORD for David my father and you shared all his hardships."
111Kg 2:27 So Solomon deposed Abiathar from his position as priest of the LORD, thereby fulfilling the prophecy the LORD had given at Shiloh concerning the descendants of Eli.
111Kg 2:28 Joab had not joined Absalom's earlier rebellion, but he had joined Adonijah's rebellion. So when Joab heard about Adonijah's death, he ran to the sacred tent of the LORD and grabbed onto the horns of the altar.
111Kg 2:29 When this was reported to King Solomon, he sent Benaiah son of Jehoiada to execute him.
111Kg 2:30 Benaiah went to the sacred tent of the LORD and said to Joab, "The king orders you to come out!" But Joab answered, "No, I will die here." So Benaiah returned to the king and told him what Joab had said.
111Kg 2:31 "Do as he said," the king replied. "Kill him there beside the altar and bury him. This will remove the guilt of Joab's senseless murders from me and from my father's family.
111Kg 2:32 The LORD will repay him�� for the murders of two men who were more righteous and better than he. For my father knew nothing about the deaths of Abner son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and of Amasa son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah. / ��Hebrew will return his blood on his own head
111Kg 2:33 May their blood be on Joab and his descendants forever, and may the LORD grant peace forever to David, his descendants, his dynasty, and his throne."
111Kg 2:34 So Benaiah son of Jehoiada returned to the sacred tent and killed Joab, and he was buried at his home in the wilderness.
111Kg 2:35 Then the king appointed Benaiah to command the army in place of Joab, and he installed Zadok the priest to take the place of Abiathar.
111Kg 2:36 The king then sent for Shimei and told him, "Build a house here in Jerusalem and live there. But don't step outside the city to go anywhere else.
111Kg 2:37 On the day you so much as cross the Kidron Valley, you will surely die; and your blood will be on your own head."
111Kg 2:38 Shimei replied, "Your sentence is fair; I will do whatever my lord the king commands." So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for a long time.
111Kg 2:39 But three years later two of Shimei's slaves ran away to King Achish son of Maacah of Gath. When Shimei learned where they were,
111Kg 2:40 he saddled his donkey and went to Gath to search for them. When he found them, he brought them back to Jerusalem.
111Kg 2:41 Solomon heard that Shimei had left Jerusalem and had gone to Gath and returned.
111Kg 2:42 So the king sent for Shimei and demanded, "Didn't I make you swear by the LORD and warn you not to go anywhere else or you would surely die? And you replied, 'The sentence is fair; I will do as you say.'
111Kg 2:43 Then why haven't you kept your oath to the LORD and obeyed my command?"
111Kg 2:44 The king also said to Shimei, "You certainly remember all the wicked things you did to my father, David. May the LORD now bring that evil on your own head.
111Kg 2:45 But may I, King Solomon, receive the LORD's blessings, and may one of David's descendants always sit on this throne in the presence of the LORD."
111Kg 2:46 Then, at the king's command, Benaiah son of Jehoiada took Shimei outside and killed him. So the kingdom was now firmly in Solomon's grip.
111Kg 3:1 Solomon made an alliance with Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, and married one of his daughters. He brought her to live in the City of David until he could finish building his palace and the Temple of the LORD and the wall around the city.
111Kg 3:2 At that time the people of Israel sacrificed their offerings at local places of worship, for a temple honoring the name of the LORD had not yet been built.
111Kg 3:3 Solomon loved the LORD and followed all the decrees of his father, David, except that Solomon, too, offered sacrifices and burned incense at the local places of worship.
111Kg 3:4 The most important of these places of worship was at Gibeon, so the king went there and sacrificed 1,000 burnt offerings.
111Kg 3:5 That night the LORD appeared to Solomon in a dream, and God said, "What do you want? Ask, and I will give it to you!"
111Kg 3:6 Solomon replied, "You showed faithful love to your servant my father, David, because he was honest and true and faithful to you. And you have continued your faithful love to him today by giving him a son to sit on his throne.
111Kg 3:7 "Now, O LORD my God, you have made me king instead of my father, David, but I am like a little child who doesn't know his way around.
111Kg 3:8 And here I am in the midst of your own chosen people, a nation so great and numerous they cannot be counted!
111Kg 3:9 Give me an understanding heart so that I can govern your people well and know the difference between right and wrong. For who by himself is able to govern this great people of yours?"
111Kg 3:10 The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for wisdom.
111Kg 3:11 So God replied, "Because you have asked for wisdom in governing my people with justice and have not asked for a long life or wealth or the death of your enemies - 
111Kg 3:12 I will give you what you asked for! I will give you a wise and understanding heart such as no one else has had or ever will have!
111Kg 3:13 And I will also give you what you did not ask for - riches and fame! No other king in all the world will be compared to you for the rest of your life!
111Kg 3:14 And if you follow me and obey my decrees and my commands as your father, David, did, I will give you a long life."
111Kg 3:15 Then Solomon woke up and realized it had been a dream. He returned to Jerusalem and stood before the Ark of the Lord's Covenant, where he sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then he invited all his officials to a great banquet.
111Kg 3:16 Some time later two prostitutes came to the king to have an argument settled.
111Kg 3:17 "Please, my lord," one of them began, "this woman and I live in the same house. I gave birth to a baby while she was with me in the house.
111Kg 3:18 Three days later this woman also had a baby. We were alone; there were only two of us in the house.
111Kg 3:19 "But her baby died during the night when she rolled over on it.
111Kg 3:20 Then she got up in the night and took my son from beside me while I was asleep. She laid her dead child in my arms and took mine to sleep beside her.
111Kg 3:21 And in the morning when I tried to nurse my son, he was dead! But when I looked more closely in the morning light, I saw that it wasn't my son at all."
111Kg 3:22 Then the other woman interrupted, "It certainly was your son, and the living child is mine." "No," the first woman said, "the living child is mine, and the dead one is yours." And so they argued back and forth before the king.
111Kg 3:23 Then the king said, "Let's get the facts straight. Both of you claim the living child is yours, and each says that the dead one belongs to the other.
111Kg 3:24 All right, bring me a sword." So a sword was brought to the king.
111Kg 3:25 Then he said, "Cut the living child in two, and give half to one woman and half to the other!"
111Kg 3:26 Then the woman who was the real mother of the living child, and who loved him very much, cried out, "Oh no, my lord! Give her the child - please do not kill him!" But the other woman said, "All right, he will be neither yours nor mine; divide him between us!"
111Kg 3:27 Then the king said, "Do not kill the child, but give him to the woman who wants him to live, for she is his mother!"
111Kg 3:28 When all Israel heard the king's decision, the people were in awe of the king, for they saw the wisdom God had given him for rendering justice.
111Kg 4:1 King Solomon now ruled over all Israel,
111Kg 4:2 and these were his high officials�� Azariah son of Zadok was the priest.
111Kg 4:3 Elihoreph and Ahijah, the sons of Shisha, were court secretaries. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the royal historian.
111Kg 4:4 Benaiah son of Jehoiada was commander of the army. Zadok and Abiathar were priests.
111Kg 4:5 Azariah son of Nathan was in charge of the district governors. Zabud son of Nathan, a priest, was a trusted adviser to the king.
111Kg 4:6 Ahishar was manager of the palace property. Adoniram son of Abda was in charge of the labor force.
111Kg 4:7 Solomon also had twelve district governors who were over all Israel. They were responsible for providing food for the king's household. Each of them arranged provisions for one month of the year.
111Kg 4:8 These are the names of the twelve governors�� Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim.
111Kg 4:9 Ben-deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elon-bethhanan.
111Kg 4:10 Ben-hesed, in Arubboth, including Socoh and all the land of Hepher.

111Kg 4:13 Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead, including the Towns of Jair (named for Jair of the tribe of Manasseh��) in Gilead, and in the Argob region of Bashan, including sixty large fortified towns with bronze bars on their gates. / ��Hebrew Jair son of Manasseh; compare 1 Chr 2.22
111Kg 4:14 Ahinadab son of Iddo, in Mahanaim.
111Kg 4:15 Ahimaaz, in Naphtali. (He was married to Basemath, another of Solomon's daughters.)
111Kg 4:16 Baana son of Hushai, in Asher and in Aloth.
111Kg 4:17 Jehoshaphat son of Paruah, in Issachar.
111Kg 4:18 Shimei son of Ela, in Benjamin.
111Kg 4:19 Geber son of Uri, in the land of Gilead��, including the territories of King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan. There was also one governor over the land of Judah��. / ��Greek version reads of Gad; compare 4.13 ��As in some Greek manuscripts; Hebrew lacks of Judah. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
111Kg 4:20 The people of Judah and Israel were as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They were very contented, with plenty to eat and drink.
111Kg 4:21 ��Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River�� in the north to the land of the Philistines and the border of Egypt in the south. The conquered peoples of those lands sent tribute money to Solomon and continued to serve him throughout his lifetime. / ��Verses 4.21-34 are numbered 5.1-14 in Hebrew text ��Hebrew the river; also in 4.24
111Kg 4:22 The daily food requirements for Solomon's palace were 150 bushels of choice flour and 300 bushels of meal��; / ��Hebrew 30 cors [5.5 kiloliters] of choice flour and 60 cors [11 kiloliters] of meal
111Kg 4:23 also 10 oxen from the fattening pens, 20 pasture-fed cattle, 100 sheep or goats, as well as deer, gazelles, roe deer, and choice poultry��. / ��Or and fattened geese
111Kg 4:24 Solomon's dominion extended over all the kingdoms west of the Euphrates River, from Tiphsah to Gaza. And there was peace on all his borders.
111Kg 4:25 During the lifetime of Solomon, all of Judah and Israel lived in peace and safety. And from Dan in the north to Beersheba in the south, each family had its own home and garden��. / ��Hebrew each family lived under its own grapevine and under its own fig tree
111Kg 4:26 Solomon had 4,000�� stalls for his chariot horses, and he had 12,000 horses��. / ��As in some Greek manuscripts (see also 2 Chr 9.25); Hebrew reads 40,000 ��Or 12,000 charioteers
111Kg 4:27 The district governors faithfully provided food for King Solomon and his court; each made sure nothing was lacking during the month assigned to him.
111Kg 4:28 They also brought the necessary barley and straw for the royal horses in the stables.
111Kg 4:29 God gave Solomon very great wisdom and understanding, and knowledge as vast as the sands of the seashore.
111Kg 4:30 In fact, his wisdom exceeded that of all the wise men of the East and the wise men of Egypt.
111Kg 4:31 He was wiser than anyone else, including Ethan the Ezrahite and the sons of Mahol - Heman, Calcol, and Darda. His fame spread throughout all the surrounding nations.
111Kg 4:32 He composed some 3,000 proverbs and wrote 1,005 songs.
111Kg 4:33 He could speak with authority about all kinds of plants, from the great cedar of Lebanon to the tiny hyssop that grows from cracks in a wall. He could also speak about animals, birds, small creatures, and fish.
111Kg 4:34 And kings from every nation sent their ambassadors to listen to the wisdom of Solomon.
111Kg 5:1 ��King Hiram of Tyre had always been a loyal friend of David. When Hiram learned that David's son Solomon was the new king of Israel, he sent ambassadors to congratulate him. / ��Verses 5.1-18 are numbered 5.15-32 in Hebrew text
111Kg 5:2 Then Solomon sent this message back to Hiram.
111Kg 5:3 "You know that my father, David, was not able to build a Temple to honor the name of the LORD his God because of the many wars waged against him by surrounding nations. He could not build until the LORD gave him victory over all his enemies.
111Kg 5:4 But now the LORD my God has given me peace on every side; I have no enemies, and all is well.
111Kg 5:5 So I am planning to build a Temple to honor the name of the LORD my God, just as he had instructed my father, David. For the LORD told him, 'Your son, whom I will place on your throne, will build the Temple to honor my name.'
111Kg 5:6 "Therefore, please command that cedars from Lebanon be cut for me. Let my men work alongside yours, and I will pay your men whatever wages you ask. As you know, there is no one among us who can cut timber like you Sidonians!"
111Kg 5:7 When Hiram received Solomon's message, he was very pleased and said, "Praise the LORD today for giving David a wise son to be king of the great nation of Israel."
111Kg 5:8 Then he sent this reply to Solomon�� "I have received your message, and I will supply all the cedar and cypress timber you need.
111Kg 5:9 My servants will bring the logs from the Lebanon mountains to the Mediterranean Sea�� and make them into rafts and float them along the coast to whatever place you choose. Then we will break the rafts apart so you can carry the logs away. You can pay me by supplying me with food for my household." / ��Hebrew the sea
111Kg 5:10 So Hiram supplied as much cedar and cypress timber as Solomon desired.
111Kg 5:11 In return, Solomon sent him an annual payment of 100,000 bushels�� of wheat for his household and 110,000 gallons�� of pure olive oil. / ��Hebrew 20,000 cors [3,640 kiloliters] ��As in Greek version, which reads 20,000 baths [420 kiloliters] (see also 2 Chr 2.10); Hebrew reads 20 cors, about 800 gallons or 3.6 kiloliters in volume
111Kg 5:12 So the LORD gave wisdom to Solomon, just as he had promised. And Hiram and Solomon made a formal alliance of peace.
111Kg 5:13 Then King Solomon conscripted a labor force of 30,000 men from all Israel.
111Kg 5:14 He sent them to Lebanon in shifts, 10,000 every month, so that each man would be one month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of this labor force.
111Kg 5:15 Solomon also had 70,000 common laborers, 80,000 quarry workers in the hill country,
111Kg 5:16 and 3,600�� foremen to supervise the work. / ��As in some Greek manuscripts (see also 2 Chr 2.2, 18); Hebrew reads 3,300
111Kg 5:17 At the king's command, they quarried large blocks of high-quality stone and shaped them to make the foundation of the Temple.
111Kg 5:18 Men from the city of Gebal helped Solomon's and Hiram's builders prepare the timber and stone for the Temple.
111Kg 6:1 It was in midspring, in the month of Ziv��, during the fourth year of Solomon's reign, that he began to construct the Temple of the LORD. This was 480 years after the people of Israel were rescued from their slavery in the land of Egypt. / ��Hebrew It was in the month of Ziv, which is the second month. This month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of April and May
111Kg 6:2 The Temple that King Solomon built for the LORD was 90 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 45 feet high��. / ��Hebrew 60 cubits [27.6 meters] long, 20 cubits [9.2 meters] wide, and 30 cubits [13.8 meters] high
111Kg 6:3 The entry room at the front of the Temple was 30 feet�� wide, running across the entire width of the Temple. It projected outward 15 feet�� from the front of the Temple. / ��Hebrew 20 cubits [9.2 meters]; also in 6.16, 20 ��Hebrew 10 cubits [4.6 meters]
111Kg 6:4 Solomon also made narrow recessed windows throughout the Temple.
111Kg 6:5 He built a complex of rooms against the outer walls of the Temple, all the way around the sides and rear of the building.
111Kg 6:6 The complex was three stories high, the bottom floor being 7 1/2 feet wide, the second floor 9 feet wide, and the top floor 10 1/2 feet wide��. The rooms were connected to the walls of the Temple by beams resting on ledges built out from the wall. So the beams were not inserted into the walls themselves. / ��Hebrew the bottom floor being 5 cubits [2.3 meters] wide, the second floor 6 cubits [2.8 meters] wide, and the top floor 7 cubits [3.2 meters] wide
111Kg 6:7 The stones used in the construction of the Temple were finished at the quarry, so there was no sound of hammer, ax, or any other iron tool at the building site.
111Kg 6:8 The entrance to the bottom floor�� was on the south side of the Temple. There were winding stairs going up to the second floor, and another flight of stairs between the second and third floors. / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew reads middle floor
111Kg 6:9 After completing the Temple structure, Solomon put in a ceiling made of cedar beams and planks.
111Kg 6:10 As already stated, he built a complex of rooms on three sides of the building, attached to the Temple walls by cedar timbers. Each story of the complex was 7 1/2 feet�� high. / ��Hebrew 5 cubits [2.3 meters]
111Kg 6:11 Then the LORD gave this message to Solomon.
111Kg 6:12 "Concerning this Temple you are building, if you keep all my decrees and regulations and obey all my commands, I will fulfill through you the promise I made to your father, David.
111Kg 6:13 I will live among the Israelites and will never abandon my people Israel."
111Kg 6:14 So Solomon finished building the Temple.
111Kg 6:15 The entire inside, from floor to ceiling, was paneled with wood. He paneled the walls and ceilings with cedar, and he used planks of cypress for the floors.
111Kg 6:16 He partitioned off an inner sanctuary - the Most Holy Place - at the far end of the Temple. It was 30 feet deep and was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling.
111Kg 6:17 The main room of the Temple, outside the Most Holy Place, was 60 feet�� long. / ��Hebrew 40 cubits [18.4 meters]
111Kg 6:18 Cedar paneling completely covered the stone walls throughout the Temple, and the paneling was decorated with carvings of gourds and open flowers.
111Kg 6:19 He prepared the inner sanctuary at the far end of the Temple, where the Ark of the LORD's Covenant would be placed.
111Kg 6:20 This inner sanctuary was 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high. He overlaid the inside with solid gold. He also overlaid the altar made of cedar��. / ��Or overlaid the altar with cedar. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
111Kg 6:21 Then Solomon overlaid the rest of the Temple's interior with solid gold, and he made gold chains to protect the entrance�� to the Most Holy Place. / ��Or to draw curtains across. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
111Kg 6:22 So he finished overlaying the entire Temple with gold, including the altar that belonged to the Most Holy Place.
111Kg 6:23 He made two cherubim of wild olive�� wood, each 15 feet�� tall, and placed them in the inner sanctuary. / ��Or pine; Hebrew reads oil tree; also in 6.31, 33 ��Hebrew 10 cubits [4.6 meters]; also in 6.24, 25
111Kg 6:24 The wingspan of each of the cherubim was 15 feet, each wing being 7 1/2 feet�� long. / ��Hebrew 5 cubits [2.3 meters]
111Kg 6:25 The two cherubim were identical in shape and size;
111Kg 6:26 each was 15 feet tall.
111Kg 6:27 He placed them side by side in the inner sanctuary of the Temple. Their outspread wings reached from wall to wall, while their inner wings touched at the center of the room.
111Kg 6:28 He overlaid the two cherubim with gold.
111Kg 6:29 He decorated all the walls of the inner sanctuary and the main room with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers.
111Kg 6:30 He overlaid the floor in both rooms with gold.
111Kg 6:31 For the entrance to the inner sanctuary, he made double doors of wild olive wood with five-sided doorposts��. / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
111Kg 6:32 These double doors were decorated with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. The doors, including the decorations of cherubim and palm trees, were overlaid with gold.
111Kg 6:33 Then he made four-sided doorposts of wild olive wood for the entrance to the Temple.
111Kg 6:34 There were two folding doors of cypress wood, and each door was hinged to fold back upon itself.
111Kg 6:35 These doors were decorated with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers - all overlaid evenly with gold.
111Kg 6:36 The walls of the inner courtyard were built so that there was one layer of cedar beams between every three layers of finished stone.
111Kg 6:37 The foundation of the LORD's Temple was laid in midspring, in the month of Ziv��, during the fourth year of Solomon's reign. / ��Hebrew was laid in the month of Ziv. This month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of April and May
111Kg 6:38 The entire building was completed in every detail by midautumn, in the month of Bul��, during the eleventh year of his reign. So it took seven years to build the Temple. / ��Hebrew by the month of Bul, which is the eighth month. This month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of October and November
111Kg 7:1 Solomon also built a palace for himself, and it took him thirteen years to complete the construction.
111Kg 7:2 One of Solomon's buildings was called the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. It was 150 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high��. There were four rows of cedar pillars, and great cedar beams rested on the pillars. / ��Hebrew 100 cubits [46 meters] long, 50 cubits [23 meters] wide, and 30 cubits [13.5 meters] high
111Kg 7:3 The hall had a cedar roof. Above the beams on the pillars were forty-five side rooms��, arranged in three tiers of fifteen each. / ��Or 45 rafters, or 45 beams, or 45 pillars. The architectural details in 7.2-6 can be interpreted in many different ways
111Kg 7:4 On each end of the long hall were three rows of windows facing each other.
111Kg 7:5 All the doorways and doorposts�� had rectangular frames and were arranged in sets of three, facing each other. / ��Greek version reads windows
111Kg 7:6 Solomon also built the Hall of Pillars, which was 75 feet long and 45 feet wide��. There was a porch in front, along with a canopy supported by pillars. / ��Hebrew 50 cubits [23 meters] long and 30 cubits [13.8 meters] wide
111Kg 7:7 Solomon also built the throne room, known as the Hall of Justice, where he sat to hear legal matters. It was paneled with cedar from floor to ceiling��. / ��As in Syriac version and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew reads from floor to floor
111Kg 7:8 Solomon's living quarters surrounded a courtyard behind this hall, and they were constructed the same way. He also built similar living quarters for Pharaoh's daughter, whom he had married.
111Kg 7:9 From foundation to eaves, all these buildings were built from huge blocks of high-quality stone, cut with saws and trimmed to exact measure on all sides.
111Kg 7:10 Some of the huge foundation stones were 15 feet long, and some were 12 feet�� long. / ��Hebrew 10 cubits [4.6 meters] . . . 8 cubits [3.7 meters]
111Kg 7:11 The blocks of high-quality stone used in the walls were also cut to measure, and cedar beams were also used.
111Kg 7:12 The walls of the great courtyard were built so that there was one layer of cedar beams between every three layers of finished stone, just like the walls of the inner courtyard of the LORD's Temple with its entry room.
111Kg 7:13 King Solomon then asked for a man named Huram�� to come from Tyre. / ��Hebrew Hiram (also in 7.40, 45); compare 2 Chr 2.13. This is not the same person mentioned in 5.1
111Kg 7:14 He was half Israelite, since his mother was a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, and his father had been a craftsman in bronze from Tyre. Huram was extremely skillful and talented in any work in bronze, and he came to do all the metal work for King Solomon.
111Kg 7:15 Huram cast two bronze pillars, each 27 feet tall and 18 feet in circumference��. / ��Hebrew 18 cubits [8.3 meters] tall and 12 cubits [5.5 meters] in circumference
111Kg 7:16 For the tops of the pillars he cast bronze capitals, each 7 1/2 feet�� tall. / ��Hebrew 5 cubits [2.3 meters]
111Kg 7:17 Each capital was decorated with seven sets of latticework and interwoven chains.
111Kg 7:18 He also encircled the latticework with two rows of pomegranates to decorate the capitals over the pillars.
111Kg 7:19 The capitals on the columns inside the entry room were shaped like water lilies, and they were six feet�� tall. / ��Hebrew 4 cubits [1.8 meters]; also in 7.38
111Kg 7:20 The capitals on the two pillars had 200 pomegranates in two rows around them, beside the rounded surface next to the latticework.
111Kg 7:21 Huram set the pillars at the entrance of the Temple, one toward the south and one toward the north. He named the one on the south Jakin, and the one on the north Boaz��. / ��Jakin probably means "he establishes"; Boaz probably means "in him is strength"
111Kg 7:22 The capitals on the pillars were shaped like water lilies. And so the work on the pillars was finished.
111Kg 7:23 Then Huram cast a great round basin, 15 feet across from rim to rim, called the Sea. It was 7 1/2 feet deep and about 45 feet in circumference��. / ��Hebrew 10 cubits [4.6 meters] across. . . . 5 cubits [2.3 meters] deep and 30 cubits [13.8 meters] in circumference
111Kg 7:24 It was encircled just below its rim by two rows of decorative gourds. There were about six gourds per foot�� all the way around, and they were cast as part of the basin. / ��Or 20 gourds per meter; Hebrew reads 10 per cubit
111Kg 7:25 The Sea was placed on a base of twelve bronze oxen��, all facing outward. Three faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east, and the Sea rested on them. / ��Hebrew 12 oxen; compare 2 Kgs 16.17, which specifies bronze oxen
111Kg 7:26 The walls of the Sea were about three inches�� thick, and its rim flared out like a cup and resembled a water lily blossom. It could hold about 11,000 gallons�� of water. / ��Hebrew a handbreadth [8 centimeters] ��Hebrew 2,000 baths [42 kiloliters]
111Kg 7:27 Huram also made ten bronze water carts, each 6 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 4 1/2 feet tall��. / ��Hebrew 4 cubits [1.8 meters] long, 4 cubits wide, and 3 cubits [1.4 meters] high
111Kg 7:28 They were constructed with side panels braced with crossbars.
111Kg 7:29 Both the panels and the crossbars were decorated with carved lions, oxen, and cherubim. Above and below the lions and oxen were wreath decorations.
111Kg 7:30 Each of these carts had four bronze wheels and bronze axles. There were supporting posts for the bronze basins at the corners of the carts; these supports were decorated on each side with carvings of wreaths.
111Kg 7:31 The top of each cart had a rounded frame for the basin. It projected 1 1/2 feet�� above the cart's top like a round pedestal, and its opening was 2 1/4 feet�� across; it was decorated on the outside with carvings of wreaths. The panels of the carts were square, not round. / ��Hebrew a cubit [46 centimeters] ��Hebrew 1 1/2 cubits [69 centimeters]; also in 7.32
111Kg 7:32 Under the panels were four wheels that were connected to axles that had been cast as one unit with the cart. The wheels were 2 1/4 feet in diameter
111Kg 7:33 and were similar to chariot wheels. The axles, spokes, rims, and hubs were all cast from molten bronze.
111Kg 7:34 There were handles at each of the four corners of the carts, and these, too, were cast as one unit with the cart.
111Kg 7:35 Around the top of each cart was a rim nine inches wide��. The corner supports and side panels were cast as one unit with the cart. / ��Hebrew half a cubit wide [23 centimeters]
111Kg 7:36 Carvings of cherubim, lions, and palm trees decorated the panels and corner supports wherever there was room, and there were wreaths all around.
111Kg 7:37 All ten water carts were the same size and were made alike, for each was cast from the same mold.
111Kg 7:38 Huram also made ten smaller bronze basins, one for each cart. Each basin was six feet across and could hold 220 gallons�� of water. / ��Hebrew 40 baths [840 liters]
111Kg 7:39 He set five water carts on the south side of the Temple and five on the north side. The great bronze basin called the Sea was placed near the southeast corner of the Temple.
111Kg 7:40 He also made the necessary washbasins, shovels, and bowls.So at last Huram completed everything King Solomon had assigned him to make for the Temple of the LORD.
111Kg 7:41 the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two networks of interwoven chains that decorated the capitals;
111Kg 7:42 the 400 pomegranates that hung from the chains on the capitals (two rows of pomegranates for each of the chain networks that decorated the capitals on top of the pillars);
111Kg 7:43 the ten water carts holding the ten basins;
111Kg 7:44 the Sea and the twelve oxen under it;
111Kg 7:45 the ash buckets, the shovels, and the bowls. Huram made all these things of burnished bronze for the Temple of the LORD, just as King Solomon had directed.
111Kg 7:46 The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zarethan.
111Kg 7:47 Solomon did not weigh all these things because there were so many; the weight of the bronze could not be measured.
111Kg 7:48 Solomon also made all the furnishings of the Temple of the LORD�� the gold altar; the gold table for the Bread of the Presence;
111Kg 7:49 the lampstands of solid gold, five on the south and five on the north, in front of the Most Holy Place; the flower decorations, lamps, and tongs - all of gold;
111Kg 7:50 the small bowls, lamp snuffers, bowls, dishes, and incense burners - all of solid gold; the doors for the entrances to the Most Holy Place and the main room of the Temple, with their fronts overlaid with gold.
111Kg 7:51 So King Solomon finished all his work on the Temple of the LORD. Then he brought all the gifts his father, David, had dedicated - the silver, the gold, and the various articles - and he stored them in the treasuries of the LORD's Temple.
111Kg 8:1 Solomon then summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes - the leaders of the ancestral families of the Israelites. They were to bring the Ark of the LORD's Covenant to the Temple from its location in the City of David, also known as Zion.
111Kg 8:2 So all the men of Israel assembled before King Solomon at the annual Festival of Shelters, which is held in early autumn in the month of Ethanim��. / ��Hebrew at the festival in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. The Festival of Shelters began on the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day occurred in late September, October, or early November
111Kg 8:3 When all the elders of Israel arrived, the priests picked up the Ark.
111Kg 8:4 The priests and Levites brought up the Ark of the LORD along with the special tent�� and all the sacred items that had been in it. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting; i.e., the tent mentioned in 2 Sam 6.17 and 1 Chr 16.1
111Kg 8:5 There, before the Ark, King Solomon and the entire community of Israel sacrificed so many sheep, goats, and cattle that no one could keep count!
111Kg 8:6 Then the priests carried the Ark of the LORD's Covenant into the inner sanctuary of the Temple - the Most Holy Place - and placed it beneath the wings of the cherubim.
111Kg 8:7 The cherubim spread their wings over the Ark, forming a canopy over the Ark and its carrying poles.
111Kg 8:8 These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Temple's main room - the Holy Place - but not from the outside. They are still there to this day.
111Kg 8:9 Nothing was in the Ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Mount Sinai��, where the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel when they left the land of Egypt. / ��Hebrew at Horeb, another name for Sinai
111Kg 8:10 When the priests came out of the Holy Place, a thick cloud filled the Temple of the LORD.
111Kg 8:11 The priests could not continue their service because of the cloud, for the glorious presence of the LORD filled the Temple.
111Kg 8:12 Then Solomon prayed, "O LORD, you have said that you would live in a thick cloud of darkness.
111Kg 8:13 Now I have built a glorious Temple for you, a place where you can live forever!��" / ��Some Greek texts add the line Is this not written in the Book of Jashar?
111Kg 8:14 Then the king turned around to the entire community of Israel standing before him and gave this blessing.
111Kg 8:15 "Praise the LORD, the God of Israel, who has kept the promise he made to my father, David. For he told my father,
111Kg 8:16 'From the day I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I have never chosen a city among any of the tribes of Israel as the place where a Temple should be built to honor my name. But I have chosen David to be king over my people Israel.'"
111Kg 8:17 Then Solomon said, "My father, David, wanted to build this Temple to honor the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
111Kg 8:18 But the LORD told him, 'You wanted to build the Temple to honor my name. Your intention is good,
111Kg 8:19 but you are not the one to do it. One of your own sons will build the Temple to honor me.'
111Kg 8:20 "And now the LORD has fulfilled the promise he made, for I have become king in my father's place, and I now sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised. I have built this Temple to honor the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
111Kg 8:21 And I have prepared a place there for the Ark, which contains the covenant that the LORD made with our ancestors when he brought them out of Egypt."
111Kg 8:22 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the entire community of Israel. He lifted his hands toward heaven,
111Kg 8:23 and he prayed, "O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you in all of heaven above or on the earth below. You keep your covenant and show unfailing love to all who walk before you in wholehearted devotion.
111Kg 8:24 You have kept your promise to your servant David, my father. You made that promise with your own mouth, and with your own hands you have fulfilled it today.
111Kg 8:25 "And now, O LORD, God of Israel, carry out the additional promise you made to your servant David, my father. For you said to him, 'If your descendants guard their behavior and faithfully follow me as you have done, one of them will always sit on the throne of Israel.'
111Kg 8:26 Now, O God of Israel, fulfill this promise to your servant David, my father.
111Kg 8:27 "But will God really live on earth? Why, even the highest heavens cannot contain you. How much less this Temple I have built!
111Kg 8:28 Nevertheless, listen to my prayer and my plea, O LORD my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is making to you today.
111Kg 8:29 May you watch over this Temple night and day, this place where you have said, 'My name will be there.' May you always hear the prayers I make toward this place.
111Kg 8:30 May you hear the humble and earnest requests from me and your people Israel when we pray toward this place. Yes, hear us from heaven where you live, and when you hear, forgive.
111Kg 8:31 "If someone wrongs another person and is required to take an oath of innocence in front of your altar in this Temple,
111Kg 8:32 then hear from heaven and judge between your servants - the accuser and the accused. Punish the guilty as they deserve. Acquit the innocent because of their innocence.
111Kg 8:33 "If your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against you, and if they turn to you and acknowledge your name and pray to you here in this Temple,
111Kg 8:34 then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and return them to this land you gave their ancestors.
111Kg 8:35 "If the skies are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and if they pray toward this Temple and acknowledge your name and turn from their sins because you have punished them,
111Kg 8:36 then hear from heaven and forgive the sins of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them to follow the right path, and send rain on your land that you have given to your people as their special possession.
111Kg 8:37 "If there is a famine in the land or a plague or crop disease or attacks of locusts or caterpillars, or if your people's enemies are in the land besieging their towns - whatever disaster or disease there is - 
111Kg 8:38 and if your people Israel pray about their troubles, raising their hands toward this Temple,
111Kg 8:39 then hear from heaven where you live, and forgive. Give your people what their actions deserve, for you alone know each human heart.
111Kg 8:40 Then they will fear you as long as they live in the land you gave to our ancestors.
111Kg 8:41 "In the future, foreigners who do not belong to your people Israel will hear of you. They will come from distant lands because of your name,
111Kg 8:42 for they will hear of your great name and your strong hand and your powerful arm. And when they pray toward this Temple,
111Kg 8:43 then hear from heaven where you live, and grant what they ask of you. In this way, all the people of the earth will come to know and fear you, just as your own people Israel do. They, too, will know that this Temple I have built honors your name.
111Kg 8:44 "If your people go out where you send them to fight their enemies, and if they pray to the LORD by turning toward this city you have chosen and toward this Temple I have built to honor your name,
111Kg 8:45 then hear their prayers from heaven and uphold their cause.
111Kg 8:46 "If they sin against you - and who has never sinned? - you might become angry with them and let their enemies conquer them and take them captive to their land far away or near.
111Kg 8:47 But in that land of exile, they might turn to you in repentance and pray, 'We have sinned, done evil, and acted wickedly.'
111Kg 8:48 If they turn to you with their whole heart and soul in the land of their enemies and pray toward the land you gave to their ancestors - toward this city you have chosen, and toward this Temple I have built to honor your name - 
111Kg 8:49 then hear their prayers and their petition from heaven where you live, and uphold their cause.
111Kg 8:50 Forgive your people who have sinned against you. Forgive all the offenses they have committed against you. Make their captors merciful to them,
111Kg 8:51 for they are your people - your special possession - whom you brought out of the iron-smelting furnace of Egypt.
111Kg 8:52 "May your eyes be open to my requests and to the requests of your people Israel. May you hear and answer them whenever they cry out to you.
111Kg 8:53 For when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt, O Sovereign LORD, you told your servant Moses that you had set Israel apart from all the nations of the earth to be your own special possession."
111Kg 8:54 When Solomon finished making these prayers and petitions to the LORD, he stood up in front of the altar of the LORD, where he had been kneeling with his hands raised toward heaven.
111Kg 8:55 He stood and in a loud voice blessed the entire congregation of Israel.
111Kg 8:56 "Praise the LORD who has given rest to his people Israel, just as he promised. Not one word has failed of all the wonderful promises he gave through his servant Moses.
111Kg 8:57 May the LORD our God be with us as he was with our ancestors; may he never leave us or abandon us.
111Kg 8:58 May he give us the desire to do his will in everything and to obey all the commands, decrees, and regulations that he gave our ancestors.
111Kg 8:59 And may these words that I have prayed in the presence of the LORD be before him constantly, day and night, so that the LORD our God may give justice to me and to his people Israel, according to each day's needs.
111Kg 8:60 Then people all over the earth will know that the LORD alone is God and there is no other.
111Kg 8:61 And may you be completely faithful to the LORD our God. May you always obey his decrees and commands, just as you are doing today."
111Kg 8:62 Then the king and all Israel with him offered sacrifices to the LORD.
111Kg 8:63 Solomon offered to the LORD a peace offering of 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep and goats. And so the king and all the people of Israel dedicated the Temple of the LORD.
111Kg 8:64 That same day the king consecrated the central area of the courtyard in front of the LORD's Temple. He offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of peace offerings there, because the bronze altar in the LORD's presence was too small to hold all the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings.
111Kg 8:65 Then Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters�� in the presence of the LORD our God. A large congregation had gathered from as far away as Lebo-hamath in the north and the Brook of Egypt in the south. The celebration went on for fourteen days in all - seven days for the dedication of the altar and seven days for the Festival of Shelters��. / ��Hebrew the festival; see note on 8.2 ��Hebrew seven days and seven days, fourteen days; compare parallel text at 2 Chr 7.8-10
111Kg 8:66 After the festival was over��, Solomon sent the people home. They blessed the king and went to their homes joyful and glad because the LORD had been good to his servant David and to his people Israel. / ��Hebrew On the eighth day, probably referring to the day following the seven-day Festival of Shelters; compare parallel text at 2 Chr 7.9-10
111Kg 9:1 So Solomon finished building the Temple of the LORD, as well as the royal palace. He completed everything he had planned to do.
111Kg 9:2 Then the LORD appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had done before at Gibeon.
111Kg 9:3 The LORD said to him, "I have heard your prayer and your petition. I have set this Temple apart to be holy - this place you have built where my name will be honored forever. I will always watch over it, for it is dear to my heart.
111Kg 9:4 "As for you, if you will follow me with integrity and godliness, as David your father did, obeying all my commands, decrees, and regulations,
111Kg 9:5 then I will establish the throne of your dynasty over Israel forever. For I made this promise to your father, David�� 'One of your descendants will always sit on the throne of Israel.'
111Kg 9:6 "But if you or your descendants abandon me and disobey the commands and decrees I have given you, and if you serve and worship other gods,
111Kg 9:7 then I will uproot Israel from this land that I have given them. I will reject this Temple that I have made holy to honor my name. I will make Israel an object of mockery and ridicule among the nations.
111Kg 9:8 And though this Temple is impressive now, all who pass by will be appalled and will shake their heads in amazement. They will ask, 'Why did the LORD do such terrible things to this land and to this Temple?'
111Kg 9:9 "And the answer will be, 'Because his people abandoned the LORD their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt, and they worshiped other gods instead and bowed down to them. That is why the LORD has brought all these disasters on them.'"
111Kg 9:10 It took Solomon twenty years to build the LORD's Temple and his own royal palace. At the end of that time,
111Kg 9:11 he gave twenty towns in the land of Galilee to King Hiram of Tyre. (Hiram had previously provided all the cedar and cypress timber and gold that Solomon had requested.)
111Kg 9:12 But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the towns Solomon had given him, he was not at all pleased with them.
111Kg 9:13 "What kind of towns are these, my brother?" he asked. So Hiram called that area Cabul (which means "worthless"), as it is still known today.
111Kg 9:14 Nevertheless, Hiram paid�� Solomon 9,000 pounds�� of gold. / ��Or For Hiram had paid ��Hebrew 120 talents [4,000 kilograms]
111Kg 9:15 This is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon conscripted to build the LORD's Temple, the royal palace, the supporting terraces��, the wall of Jerusalem, and the cities of Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. / ��Hebrew the millo; also in 9.24. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
111Kg 9:16 (Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had attacked and captured Gezer, killing the Canaanite population and burning it down. He gave the city to his daughter as a wedding gift when she married Solomon.
111Kg 9:17 So Solomon rebuilt the city of Gezer.) He also built up the towns of Lower Beth-horon,
111Kg 9:18 Baalath, and Tamar�� in the wilderness within his land. / ��An alternate reading in the Masoretic Text reads Tadmor
111Kg 9:19 He built towns as supply centers and constructed towns where his chariots and horses�� could be stationed. He built everything he desired in Jerusalem and Lebanon and throughout his entire realm. / ��Or and charioteers
111Kg 9:20 There were still some people living in the land who were not Israelites, including Amorites, Hittites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
111Kg 9:21 These were descendants of the nations whom the people of Israel had not completely destroyed��. So Solomon conscripted them for his labor force, and they serve in the labor force to this day. / ��The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering
111Kg 9:22 But Solomon did not conscript any of the Israelites for forced labor. Instead, he assigned them to serve as fighting men, government officials, officers and captains in his army, commanders of his chariots, and charioteers.
111Kg 9:23 Solomon appointed 550 of them to supervise the people working on his various projects.
111Kg 9:24 Solomon moved his wife, Pharaoh's daughter, from the City of David to the new palace he had built for her. Then he constructed the supporting terraces.
111Kg 9:25 Three times each year Solomon presented burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar he had built for the LORD. He also burned incense to the LORD. And so he finished the work of building the Temple.
111Kg 9:26 King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, a port near Elath�� in the land of Edom, along the shore of the Red Sea��. / ��As in Greek version (see also 2 Kgs 14.22; 16.6); Hebrew reads Eloth, a variant spelling of Elath ��Hebrew sea of reeds
111Kg 9:27 Hiram sent experienced crews of sailors to sail the ships with Solomon's men.
111Kg 9:28 They sailed to Ophir and brought back to Solomon some sixteen tons�� of gold. / ��Hebrew 420 talents [14 metric tons]
111Kg 10:1 When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, which brought honor to the name of the LORD��, she came to test him with hard questions. / ��Or which was due to the name of the LORD. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
111Kg 10:2 She arrived in Jerusalem with a large group of attendants and a great caravan of camels loaded with spices, large quantities of gold, and precious jewels. When she met with Solomon, she talked with him about everything she had on her mind.
111Kg 10:3 Solomon had answers for all her questions; nothing was too hard for the king to explain to her.
111Kg 10:4 When the queen of Sheba realized how very wise Solomon was, and when she saw the palace he had built,
111Kg 10:5 she was overwhelmed. She was also amazed at the food on his tables, the organization of his officials and their splendid clothing, the cup-bearers, and the burnt offerings Solomon made at the Temple of the LORD.
111Kg 10:6 She exclaimed to the king, "Everything I heard in my country about your achievements�� and wisdom is true! / ��Hebrew your words
111Kg 10:7 I didn't believe what was said until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes. In fact, I had not heard the half of it! Your wisdom and prosperity are far beyond what I was told.
111Kg 10:8 How happy your people�� must be! What a privilege for your officials to stand here day after day, listening to your wisdom! / ��Greek and Syriac versions and Latin Vulgate read your wives
111Kg 10:9 Praise the LORD your God, who delights in you and has placed you on the throne of Israel. Because of the LORD's eternal love for Israel, he has made you king so you can rule with justice and righteousness."
111Kg 10:10 Then she gave the king a gift of 9,000 pounds�� of gold, great quantities of spices, and precious jewels. Never again were so many spices brought in as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. / ��Hebrew 120 talents [4,000 kilograms]
111Kg 10:11 (In addition, Hiram's ships brought gold from Ophir, and they also brought rich cargoes of red sandalwood�� and precious jewels. / ��Hebrew almug wood; also in 10.12
111Kg 10:12 The king used the sandalwood to make railings for the Temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and to construct lyres and harps for the musicians. Never before or since has there been such a supply of sandalwood.)
111Kg 10:13 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba whatever she asked for, besides all the customary gifts he had so generously given. Then she and all her attendants returned to their own land.
111Kg 10:14 Each year Solomon received about 25 tons�� of gold. / ��Hebrew 666 talents [23 metric tons]
111Kg 10:15 This did not include the additional revenue he received from merchants and traders, all the kings of Arabia, and the governors of the land.
111Kg 10:16 King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold, each weighing more than fifteen pounds��. / ��Hebrew 600 [shekels] of gold [6.8 kilograms]
111Kg 10:17 He also made 300 smaller shields of hammered gold, each weighing nearly four pounds��. The king placed these shields in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. / ��Hebrew 3 minas [1.8 kilograms]
111Kg 10:18 Then the king made a huge throne, decorated with ivory and overlaid with fine gold.
111Kg 10:19 The throne had six steps and a rounded back. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, and the figure of a lion stood on each side of the throne.
111Kg 10:20 There were also twelve other lions, one standing on each end of the six steps. No other throne in all the world could be compared with it!
111Kg 10:21 All of King Solomon's drinking cups were solid gold, as were all the utensils in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. They were not made of silver, for silver was considered worthless in Solomon's day!
111Kg 10:22 The king had a fleet of trading ships�� that sailed with Hiram's fleet. Once every three years the ships returned, loaded with gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks��. / ��Hebrew fleet of ships of Tarshish ��Or and baboons
111Kg 10:23 So King Solomon became richer and wiser than any other king on earth.
111Kg 10:24 People from every nation came to consult him and to hear the wisdom God had given him.
111Kg 10:25 Year after year everyone who visited brought him gifts of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
111Kg 10:26 Solomon built up a huge force of chariots and horses��. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses. He stationed some of them in the chariot cities and some near him in Jerusalem. / ��Or charioteers; also in 10.26b
111Kg 10:27 The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah��. / ��Hebrew the Shephelah
111Kg 10:28 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt�� and from Cilicia��; the king's traders acquired them from Cilicia at the standard price. / ��Possibly Muzur, a district near Cilicia; also in 10.29 ��Hebrew Kue, probably another name for Cilicia
111Kg 10:29 At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver��, and horses for 150 pieces of silver��. They were then exported to the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram. / ��Hebrew 600 [shekels] of silver, about 15 pounds or 6.8 kilograms in weight ��Hebrew 150 [shekels], about 3.8 pounds or 1.7 kilograms in weight
111Kg 11:1 Now King Solomon loved many foreign women. Besides Pharaoh's daughter, he married women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, Sidon, and from among the Hittites.
111Kg 11:2 The LORD had clearly instructed the people of Israel, 'You must not marry them, because they will turn your hearts to their gods.' Yet Solomon insisted on loving them anyway.
111Kg 11:3 He had 700 wives of royal birth and 300 concubines. And in fact, they did turn his heart away from the LORD.
111Kg 11:4 In Solomon's old age, they turned his heart to worship other gods instead of being completely faithful to the LORD his God, as his father, David, had been.
111Kg 11:5 Solomon worshiped Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians, and Molech��, the detestable god of the Ammonites. / ��Hebrew Milcom, a variant spelling of Molech; also in 11.33
111Kg 11:6 In this way, Solomon did what was evil in the LORD's sight; he refused to follow the LORD completely, as his father, David, had done.
111Kg 11:7 On the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem��, he even built a pagan shrine for Chemosh, the detestable god of Moab, and another for Molech, the detestable god of the Ammonites. / ��Hebrew On the mountain east of Jerusalem
111Kg 11:8 Solomon built such shrines for all his foreign wives to use for burning incense and sacrificing to their gods.
111Kg 11:9 The LORD was very angry with Solomon, for his heart had turned away from the LORD, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice.
111Kg 11:10 He had warned Solomon specifically about worshiping other gods, but Solomon did not listen to the LORD's command.
111Kg 11:11 So now the LORD said to him, "Since you have not kept my covenant and have disobeyed my decrees, I will surely tear the kingdom away from you and give it to one of your servants.
111Kg 11:12 But for the sake of your father, David, I will not do this while you are still alive. I will take the kingdom away from your son.
111Kg 11:13 And even so, I will not take away the entire kingdom; I will let him be king of one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, my chosen city."
111Kg 11:14 Then the LORD raised up Hadad the Edomite, a member of Edom's royal family, to be Solomon's adversary.
111Kg 11:15 Years before, David had defeated Edom. Joab, his army commander, had stayed to bury some of the Israelite soldiers who had died in battle. While there, they killed every male in Edom.
111Kg 11:16 Joab and the army of Israel had stayed there for six months, killing them.
111Kg 11:17 But Hadad and a few of his father's royal officials escaped and headed for Egypt. (Hadad was just a boy at the time.)
111Kg 11:18 They set out from Midian and went to Paran, where others joined them. Then they traveled to Egypt and went to Pharaoh, who gave them a home, food, and some land.
111Kg 11:19 Pharaoh grew very fond of Hadad, and he gave him his wife's sister in marriage - the sister of Queen Tahpenes.
111Kg 11:20 She bore him a son named Genubath. Tahpenes raised him�� in Pharaoh's palace among Pharaoh's own sons. / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew reads weaned him
111Kg 11:21 When the news reached Hadad in Egypt that David and his commander Joab were both dead, he said to Pharaoh, "Let me return to my own country."
111Kg 11:22 "Why?" Pharaoh asked him. "What do you lack here that makes you want to go home?" "Nothing," he replied. "But even so, please let me return home."
111Kg 11:23 God also raised up Rezon son of Eliada as Solomon's adversary. Rezon had fled from his master, King Hadadezer of Zobah,
111Kg 11:24 and had become the leader of a gang of rebels. After David conquered Hadadezer, Rezon and his men fled to Damascus, where he became king.
111Kg 11:25 Rezon was Israel's bitter adversary for the rest of Solomon's reign, and he made trouble, just as Hadad did. Rezon hated Israel intensely and continued to reign in Aram.
111Kg 11:26 Another rebel leader was Jeroboam son of Nebat, one of Solomon's own officials. He came from the town of Zeredah in Ephraim, and his mother was Zeruah, a widow.
111Kg 11:27 This is the story behind his rebellion. Solomon was rebuilding the supporting terraces�� and repairing the walls of the city of his father, David. / ��Hebrew the millo. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
111Kg 11:28 Jeroboam was a very capable young man, and when Solomon saw how industrious he was, he put him in charge of the labor force from the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh, the descendants of Joseph.
111Kg 11:29 One day as Jeroboam was leaving Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh met him along the way. Ahijah was wearing a new cloak. The two of them were alone in a field,
111Kg 11:30 and Ahijah took hold of the new cloak he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces.
111Kg 11:31 Then he said to Jeroboam, "Take ten of these pieces, for this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says�� 'I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon, and I will give ten of the tribes to you!
111Kg 11:32 But I will leave him one tribe for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel.
111Kg 11:33 For Solomon has�� abandoned me and worshiped Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians; Chemosh, the god of Moab; and Molech, the god of the Ammonites. He has not followed my ways and done what is pleasing in my sight. He has not obeyed my decrees and regulations as David his father did. / ��As in Greek, Syriac, and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew reads For they have
111Kg 11:34 "'But I will not take the entire kingdom from Solomon at this time. For the sake of my servant David, the one whom I chose and who obeyed my commands and decrees, I will keep Solomon as leader for the rest of his life.
111Kg 11:35 But I will take the kingdom away from his son and give ten of the tribes to you.
111Kg 11:36 His son will have one tribe so that the descendants of David my servant will continue to reign, shining like a lamp in Jerusalem, the city I have chosen to be the place for my name.
111Kg 11:37 And I will place you on the throne of Israel, and you will rule over all that your heart desires.
111Kg 11:38 If you listen to what I tell you and follow my ways and do whatever I consider to be right, and if you obey my decrees and commands, as my servant David did, then I will always be with you. I will establish an enduring dynasty for you as I did for David, and I will give Israel to you.
111Kg 11:39 Because of Solomon's sin I will punish the descendants of David - though not forever.'"
111Kg 11:40 Solomon tried to kill Jeroboam, but he fled to King Shishak of Egypt and stayed there until Solomon died.
111Kg 11:41 The rest of the events in Solomon's reign, including all his deeds and his wisdom, are recorded in The Book of the Acts of Solomon.
111Kg 11:42 Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.
111Kg 11:43 When he died, he was buried in the City of David, named for his father. Then his son Rehoboam became the next king.
111Kg 12:1 Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel had gathered to make him king.
111Kg 12:2 When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of this, he returned from Egypt��, for he had fled to Egypt to escape from King Solomon. / ��As in Greek version and Latin Vulgate (see also 2 Chr 10.2); Hebrew reads he lived in Egypt
111Kg 12:3 The leaders of Israel summoned him, and Jeroboam and the whole assembly of Israel went to speak with Rehoboam.
111Kg 12:4 "Your father was a hard master," they said. "Lighten the harsh labor demands and heavy taxes that your father imposed on us. Then we will be your loyal subjects."
111Kg 12:5 Rehoboam replied, "Give me three days to think this over. Then come back for my answer." So the people went away.
111Kg 12:6 Then King Rehoboam discussed the matter with the older men who had counseled his father, Solomon. "What is your advice?" he asked. "How should I answer these people?"
111Kg 12:7 The older counselors replied, "If you are willing to be a servant to these people today and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your loyal subjects."
111Kg 12:8 But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the older men and instead asked the opinion of the young men who had grown up with him and were now his advisers.
111Kg 12:9 "What is your advice?" he asked them. "How should I answer these people who want me to lighten the burdens imposed by my father?"
111Kg 12:10 The young men replied, "This is what you should tell those complainers who want a lighter burden�� 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist!
111Kg 12:11 Yes, my father laid heavy burdens on you, but I'm going to make them even heavier! My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions!'"
111Kg 12:12 Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to hear Rehoboam's decision, just as the king had ordered.
111Kg 12:13 But Rehoboam spoke harshly to the people, for he rejected the advice of the older counselors
111Kg 12:14 and followed the counsel of his younger advisers. He told the people, "My father laid heavy burdens on you, but I'm going to make them even heavier! My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions!"
111Kg 12:15 So the king paid no attention to the people. This turn of events was the will of the LORD, for it fulfilled the LORD's message to Jeroboam son of Nebat through the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh.
111Kg 12:16 When all Israel realized that the king had refused to listen to them, they responded, "Down with the dynasty of David! We have no interest in the son of Jesse. Back to your homes, O Israel! Look out for your own house, O David!" So the people of Israel returned home.
111Kg 12:17 But Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah.
111Kg 12:18 King Rehoboam sent Adoniram��, who was in charge of the labor force, to restore order, but the people of Israel stoned him to death. When this news reached King Rehoboam, he quickly jumped into his chariot and fled to Jerusalem. / ��As in some Greek manuscripts and Syriac version (see also 4.6; 5.14); Hebrew reads Adoram
111Kg 12:19 And to this day the northern tribes of Israel have refused to be ruled by a descendant of David.
111Kg 12:20 When the people of Israel learned of Jeroboam's return from Egypt, they called an assembly and made him king over all Israel. So only the tribe of Judah remained loyal to the family of David.
111Kg 12:21 When Rehoboam arrived at Jerusalem, he mobilized the men of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin - 180,000 select troops - to fight against the men of Israel and to restore the kingdom to himself.
111Kg 12:22 But God said to Shemaiah, the man of God,
111Kg 12:23 "Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the people of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people,
111Kg 12:24 'This is what the LORD says�� Do not fight against your relatives, the Israelites. Go back home, for what has happened is my doing!'" So they obeyed the message of the LORD and went home, as the LORD had commanded.
111Kg 12:25 Jeroboam then built up the city of Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and it became his capital. Later he went and built up the town of Peniel��. / ��Hebrew Penuel, a variant spelling of Peniel
111Kg 12:26 Jeroboam thought to himself, "Unless I am careful, the kingdom will return to the dynasty of David.
111Kg 12:27 When these people go to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices at the Temple of the LORD, they will again give their allegiance to King Rehoboam of Judah. They will kill me and make him their king instead."
111Kg 12:28 So on the advice of his counselors, the king made two gold calves. He said to the people��, "It is too much trouble for you to worship in Jerusalem. Look, Israel, these are the gods who brought you out of Egypt!" / ��Hebrew to them
111Kg 12:29 He placed these calf idols in Bethel and in Dan - at either end of his kingdom.
111Kg 12:30 But this became a great sin, for the people worshiped the idols, traveling as far north as Dan to worship the one there.
111Kg 12:31 Jeroboam also erected buildings at the pagan shrines and ordained priests from the common people - those who were not from the priestly tribe of Levi.
111Kg 12:32 And Jeroboam instituted a religious festival in Bethel, held on the fifteenth day of the eighth month��, in imitation of the annual Festival of Shelters in Judah. There at Bethel he himself offered sacrifices to the calves he had made, and he appointed priests for the pagan shrines he had made. / ��This day of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in late October or early November, exactly one month after the annual Festival of Shelters in Judah (see Lev 23.34)
111Kg 12:33 So on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, a day that he himself had designated, Jeroboam offered sacrifices on the altar at Bethel. He instituted a religious festival for Israel, and he went up to the altar to burn incense.
111Kg 13:1 At the LORD's command, a man of God from Judah went to Bethel, arriving there just as Jeroboam was approaching the altar to burn incense.
111Kg 13:2 Then at the LORD's command, he shouted, "O altar, altar! This is what the LORD says�� A child named Josiah will be born into the dynasty of David. On you he will sacrifice the priests from the pagan shrines who come here to burn incense, and human bones will be burned on you."
111Kg 13:3 That same day the man of God gave a sign to prove his message. He said, "The LORD has promised to give this sign�� This altar will split apart, and its ashes will be poured out on the ground."
111Kg 13:4 When King Jeroboam heard the man of God speaking against the altar at Bethel, he pointed at him and shouted, "Seize that man!" But instantly the king's hand became paralyzed in that position, and he couldn't pull it back.
111Kg 13:5 At the same time a wide crack appeared in the altar, and the ashes poured out, just as the man of God had predicted in his message from the LORD.
111Kg 13:6 The king cried out to the man of God, "Please ask the LORD your God to restore my hand again!" So the man of God prayed to the LORD, and the king's hand was restored and he could move it again.
111Kg 13:7 Then the king said to the man of God, "Come to the palace with me and have something to eat, and I will give you a gift."
111Kg 13:8 But the man of God said to the king, "Even if you gave me half of everything you own, I would not go with you. I would not eat or drink anything in this place.
111Kg 13:9 For the LORD gave me this command�� 'You must not eat or drink anything while you are there, and do not return to Judah by the same way you came.'"
111Kg 13:10 So he left Bethel and went home another way.
111Kg 13:11 As it happened, there was an old prophet living in Bethel, and his sons�� came home and told him what the man of God had done in Bethel that day. They also told their father what the man had said to the king. / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew reads son
111Kg 13:12 The old prophet asked them, "Which way did he go?" So they showed their father�� which road the man of God had taken. / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew reads They had seen
111Kg 13:13 "Quick, saddle the donkey," the old man said. So they saddled the donkey for him, and he mounted it.
111Kg 13:14 Then he rode after the man of God and found him sitting under a great tree. The old prophet asked him, "Are you the man of God who came from Judah?" "Yes, I am," he replied.
111Kg 13:15 Then he said to the man of God, "Come home with me and eat some food."
111Kg 13:16 "No, I cannot," he replied. "I am not allowed to eat or drink anything here in this place.
111Kg 13:17 For the LORD gave me this command�� 'You must not eat or drink anything while you are there, and do not return to Judah by the same way you came.'"
111Kg 13:18 But the old prophet answered, "I am a prophet, too, just as you are. And an angel gave me this command from the LORD�� 'Bring him home with you so he can have something to eat and drink.'" But the old man was lying to him.
111Kg 13:19 So they went back together, and the man of God ate and drank at the prophet's home.
111Kg 13:20 Then while they were sitting at the table, a command from the LORD came to the old prophet.
111Kg 13:21 He cried out to the man of God from Judah, "This is what the LORD says�� You have defied the word of the LORD and have disobeyed the command the LORD your God gave you.
111Kg 13:22 You came back to this place and ate and drank where he told you not to eat or drink. Because of this, your body will not be buried in the grave of your ancestors."
111Kg 13:23 After the man of God had finished eating and drinking, the old prophet saddled his own donkey for him,
111Kg 13:24 and the man of God started off again. But as he was traveling along, a lion came out and killed him. His body lay there on the road, with the donkey and the lion standing beside it.
111Kg 13:25 People who passed by saw the body lying in the road and the lion standing beside it, and they went and reported it in Bethel, where the old prophet lived.
111Kg 13:26 When the prophet heard the report, he said, "It is the man of God who disobeyed the LORD's command. The LORD has fulfilled his word by causing the lion to attack and kill him."
111Kg 13:27 Then the prophet said to his sons, "Saddle a donkey for me." So they saddled a donkey,
111Kg 13:28 and he went out and found the body lying in the road. The donkey and lion were still standing there beside it, for the lion had not eaten the body nor attacked the donkey.
111Kg 13:29 So the prophet laid the body of the man of God on the donkey and took it back to the town to mourn over him and bury him.
111Kg 13:30 He laid the body in his own grave, crying out in grief, "Oh, my brother!"
111Kg 13:31 Afterward the prophet said to his sons, "When I die, bury me in the grave where the man of God is buried. Lay my bones beside his bones.
111Kg 13:32 For the message the LORD told him to proclaim against the altar in Bethel and against the pagan shrines in the towns of Samaria will certainly come true."
111Kg 13:33 But even after this, Jeroboam did not turn from his evil ways. He continued to choose priests from the common people. He appointed anyone who wanted to become a priest for the pagan shrines.
111Kg 13:34 This became a great sin and resulted in the utter destruction of Jeroboam's dynasty from the face of the earth.
111Kg 14:1 At that time Jeroboam's son Abijah became very sick.
111Kg 14:2 So Jeroboam told his wife, "Disguise yourself so that no one will recognize you as my wife. Then go to the prophet Ahijah at Shiloh - the man who told me I would become king.
111Kg 14:3 Take him a gift of ten loaves of bread, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and ask him what will happen to the boy."
111Kg 14:4 So Jeroboam's wife went to Ahijah's home at Shiloh. He was an old man now and could no longer see.
111Kg 14:5 But the LORD had told Ahijah, "Jeroboam's wife will come here, pretending to be someone else. She will ask you about her son, for he is very sick. Give her the answer I give you."
111Kg 14:6 So when Ahijah heard her footsteps at the door, he called out, "Come in, wife of Jeroboam! Why are you pretending to be someone else?" Then he told her, "I have bad news for you.
111Kg 14:7 Give your husband, Jeroboam, this message from the LORD, the God of Israel�� 'I promoted you from the ranks of the common people and made you ruler over my people Israel.
111Kg 14:8 I ripped the kingdom away from the family of David and gave it to you. But you have not been like my servant David, who obeyed my commands and followed me with all his heart and always did whatever I wanted.
111Kg 14:9 You have done more evil than all who lived before you. You have made other gods for yourself and have made me furious with your gold calves. And since you have turned your back on me,
111Kg 14:10 I will bring disaster on your dynasty and will destroy every one of your male descendants, slave and free alike, anywhere in Israel. I will burn up your royal dynasty as one burns up trash until it is all gone.
111Kg 14:11 The members of Jeroboam's family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the field will be eaten by vultures. I, the LORD, have spoken.'"
111Kg 14:12 Then Ahijah said to Jeroboam's wife, "Go on home, and when you enter the city, the child will die.
111Kg 14:13 All Israel will mourn for him and bury him. He is the only member of your family who will have a proper burial, for this child is the only good thing that the LORD, the God of Israel, sees in the entire family of Jeroboam.
111Kg 14:14 "In addition, the LORD will raise up a king over Israel who will destroy the family of Jeroboam. This will happen today, even now!
111Kg 14:15 Then the LORD will shake Israel like a reed whipped about in a stream. He will uproot the people of Israel from this good land that he gave their ancestors and will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River��, for they have angered the LORD with the Asherah poles they have set up for worship. / ��Hebrew the river
111Kg 14:16 He will abandon Israel because Jeroboam sinned and made Israel sin along with him."
111Kg 14:17 So Jeroboam's wife returned to Tirzah, and the child died just as she walked through the door of her home.
111Kg 14:18 And all Israel buried him and mourned for him, as the LORD had promised through the prophet Ahijah.
111Kg 14:19 The rest of the events in Jeroboam's reign, including all his wars and how he ruled, are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 14:20 Jeroboam reigned in Israel twenty-two years. When Jeroboam died, his son Nadab became the next king.
111Kg 14:21 Meanwhile, Rehoboam son of Solomon was king in Judah. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen from among all the tribes of Israel as the place to honor his name. Rehoboam's mother was Naamah, an Ammonite woman.
111Kg 14:22 During Rehoboam's reign, the people of Judah did what was evil in the LORD's sight, provoking his anger with their sin, for it was even worse than that of their ancestors.
111Kg 14:23 For they also built for themselves pagan shrines and set up sacred pillars and Asherah poles on every high hill and under every green tree.
111Kg 14:24 There were even male and female shrine prostitutes throughout the land. The people imitated the detestable practices of the pagan nations the LORD had driven from the land ahead of the Israelites.
111Kg 14:25 In the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, King Shishak of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem.
111Kg 14:26 He ransacked the treasuries of the LORD's Temple and the royal palace; he stole everything, including all the gold shields Solomon had made.
111Kg 14:27 King Rehoboam later replaced them with bronze shields as substitutes, and he entrusted them to the care of the commanders of the guard who protected the entrance to the royal palace.
111Kg 14:28 Whenever the king went to the Temple of the LORD, the guards would also take the shields and then return them to the guardroom.
111Kg 14:29 The rest of the events in Rehoboam's reign and everything he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.
111Kg 14:30 There was constant war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam.
111Kg 14:31 When Rehoboam died, he was buried among his ancestors in the City of David. His mother was Naamah, an Ammonite woman. Then his son Abijam�� became the next king. / ��Also known as Abijah
111Kg 15:1 Abijam�� began to rule over Judah in the eighteenth year of Jeroboam's reign in Israel. / ��Also known as Abijah
111Kg 15:2 He reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother was Maacah, the daughter of Absalom��. / ��Hebrew Abishalom (also in 15.10), a variant spelling of Absalom; compare 2 Chr 11.20
111Kg 15:3 He committed the same sins as his father before him, and he was not faithful to the LORD his God, as his ancestor David had been.
111Kg 15:4 But for David's sake, the LORD his God allowed his descendants to continue ruling, shining like a lamp, and he gave Abijam a son to rule after him in Jerusalem.
111Kg 15:5 For David had done what was pleasing in the LORD's sight and had obeyed the LORD's commands throughout his life, except in the affair concerning Uriah the Hittite.
111Kg 15:6 There was war between Abijam and Jeroboam�� throughout Abijam's reign. / ��As in a few Hebrew and Greek manuscripts; most Hebrew manuscripts read between Rehoboam and Jeroboam
111Kg 15:7 The rest of the events in Abijam's reign and everything he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah. There was constant war between Abijam and Jeroboam.
111Kg 15:8 When Abijam died, he was buried in the City of David. Then his son Asa became the next king.
111Kg 15:9 Asa began to rule over Judah in the twentieth year of Jeroboam's reign in Israel.
111Kg 15:10 He reigned in Jerusalem forty-one years. His grandmother�� was Maacah, the daughter of Absalom. / ��Or The queen mother; Hebrew reads His mother (also in 15.13); compare 15.2
111Kg 15:11 Asa did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight, as his ancestor David had done.
111Kg 15:12 He banished the male and female shrine prostitutes from the land and got rid of all the idols�� his ancestors had made. / ��The Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung
111Kg 15:13 He even deposed his grandmother Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made an obscene Asherah pole. He cut down her obscene pole and burned it in the Kidron Valley.
111Kg 15:14 Although the pagan shrines were not removed, Asa's heart remained completely faithful to the LORD throughout his life.
111Kg 15:15 He brought into the Temple of the LORD the silver and gold and the various items that he and his father had dedicated.
111Kg 15:16 There was constant war between King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel.
111Kg 15:17 King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from entering or leaving King Asa's territory in Judah.
111Kg 15:18 Asa responded by removing all the silver and gold that was left in the treasuries of the Temple of the LORD and the royal palace. He sent it with some of his officials to Ben-hadad son of Tabrimmon, son of Hezion, the king of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus, along with this message.
111Kg 15:19 "Let there be a treaty�� between you and me like the one between your father and my father. See, I am sending you a gift of silver and gold. Break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will leave me alone." / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew reads There is a treaty
111Kg 15:20 Ben-hadad agreed to King Asa's request and sent the commanders of his army to attack the towns of Israel. They conquered the towns of Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Kinnereth, and all the land of Naphtali.
111Kg 15:21 As soon as Baasha of Israel heard what was happening, he abandoned his project of fortifying Ramah and withdrew to Tirzah.
111Kg 15:22 Then King Asa sent an order throughout Judah, requiring that everyone, without exception, help to carry away the building stones and timbers that Baasha had been using to fortify Ramah. Asa used these materials to fortify the town of Geba in Benjamin and the town of Mizpah.
111Kg 15:23 The rest of the events in Asa's reign - the extent of his power, everything he did, and the names of the cities he built - are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah. In his old age his feet became diseased.
111Kg 15:24 When Asa died, he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David.Then Jehoshaphat, Asa's son, became the next king.
111Kg 15:25 Nadab son of Jeroboam began to rule over Israel in the second year of King Asa's reign in Judah. He reigned in Israel two years.
111Kg 15:26 But he did what was evil in the LORD's sight and followed the example of his father, continuing the sins that Jeroboam had led Israel to commit.
111Kg 15:27 Then Baasha son of Ahijah, from the tribe of Issachar, plotted against Nadab and assassinated him while he and the Israelite army were laying siege to the Philistine town of Gibbethon.
111Kg 15:28 Baasha killed Nadab in the third year of King Asa's reign in Judah, and he became the next king of Israel.
111Kg 15:29 He immediately slaughtered all the descendants of King Jeroboam, so that not one of the royal family was left, just as the LORD had promised concerning Jeroboam by the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh.
111Kg 15:30 This was done because Jeroboam had provoked the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, by the sins he had committed and the sins he had led Israel to commit.
111Kg 15:31 The rest of the events in Nadab's reign and everything he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 15:32 There was constant war between King Asa of Judah and King Baasha of Israel.
111Kg 15:33 Baasha son of Ahijah began to rule over all Israel in the third year of King Asa's reign in Judah. Baasha reigned in Tirzah twenty-four years.
111Kg 15:34 But he did what was evil in the LORD's sight and followed the example of Jeroboam, continuing the sins that Jeroboam had led Israel to commit.
111Kg 16:1 This message from the LORD was delivered to King Baasha by the prophet Jehu son of Hanani.
111Kg 16:2 "I lifted you out of the dust to make you ruler of my people Israel, but you have followed the evil example of Jeroboam. You have provoked my anger by causing my people Israel to sin.
111Kg 16:3 So now I will destroy you and your family, just as I destroyed the descendants of Jeroboam son of Nebat.
111Kg 16:4 The members of Baasha's family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the field will be eaten by vultures."
111Kg 16:5 The rest of the events in Baasha's reign and the extent of his power are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 16:6 When Baasha died, he was buried in Tirzah. Then his son Elah became the next king.
111Kg 16:7 The message from the LORD against Baasha and his family came through the prophet Jehu son of Hanani. It was delivered because Baasha had done what was evil in the LORD's sight (just as the family of Jeroboam had done), and also because Baasha had destroyed the family of Jeroboam. The LORD's anger was provoked by Baasha's sins.
111Kg 16:8 Elah son of Baasha began to rule over Israel in the twenty-sixth year of King Asa's reign in Judah. He reigned in the city of Tirzah for two years.
111Kg 16:9 Then Zimri, who commanded half of the royal chariots, made plans to kill him. One day in Tirzah, Elah was getting drunk at the home of Arza, the supervisor of the palace.
111Kg 16:10 Zimri walked in and struck him down and killed him. This happened in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa's reign in Judah. Then Zimri became the next king.
111Kg 16:11 Zimri immediately killed the entire royal family of Baasha, leaving him not even a single male child. He even destroyed distant relatives and friends.
111Kg 16:12 So Zimri destroyed the dynasty of Baasha as the LORD had promised through the prophet Jehu.
111Kg 16:13 This happened because of all the sins Baasha and his son Elah had committed, and because of the sins they led Israel to commit. They provoked the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, with their worthless idols.
111Kg 16:14 The rest of the events in Elah's reign and everything he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 16:15 Zimri began to rule over Israel in the twenty-seventh year of King Asa's reign in Judah, but his reign in Tirzah lasted only seven days. The army of Israel was then attacking the Philistine town of Gibbethon.
111Kg 16:16 When they heard that Zimri had committed treason and had assassinated the king, that very day they chose Omri, commander of the army, as the new king of Israel.
111Kg 16:17 So Omri led the entire army of Israel up from Gibbethon to attack Tirzah, Israel's capital.
111Kg 16:18 When Zimri saw that the city had been taken, he went into the citadel of the palace and burned it down over himself and died in the flames.
111Kg 16:19 For he, too, had done what was evil in the LORD's sight. He followed the example of Jeroboam in all the sins he had committed and led Israel to commit.
111Kg 16:20 The rest of the events in Zimri's reign and his conspiracy are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 16:21 But now the people of Israel were split into two factions. Half the people tried to make Tibni son of Ginath their king, while the other half supported Omri.
111Kg 16:22 But Omri's supporters defeated the supporters of Tibni. So Tibni was killed, and Omri became the next king.
111Kg 16:23 Omri began to rule over Israel in the thirty-first year of King Asa's reign in Judah. He reigned twelve years in all, six of them in Tirzah.
111Kg 16:24 Then Omri bought the hill now known as Samaria from its owner, Shemer, for 150 pounds of silver��. He built a city on it and called the city Samaria in honor of Shemer. / ��Hebrew for 2 talents [68 kilograms] of silver
111Kg 16:25 But Omri did what was evil in the LORD's sight, even more than any of the kings before him.
111Kg 16:26 He followed the example of Jeroboam son of Nebat in all the sins he had committed and led Israel to commit. The people provoked the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, with their worthless idols.
111Kg 16:27 The rest of the events in Omri's reign, the extent of his power, and everything he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 16:28 When Omri died, he was buried in Samaria. Then his son Ahab became the next king.
111Kg 16:29 Ahab son of Omri began to rule over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of King Asa's reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria twenty-two years.
111Kg 16:30 But Ahab son of Omri did what was evil in the LORD's sight, even more than any of the kings before him.
111Kg 16:31 And as though it were not enough to follow the example of Jeroboam, he married Jezebel, the daughter of King Ethbaal of the Sidonians, and he began to bow down in worship of Baal.
111Kg 16:32 First Ahab built a temple and an altar for Baal in Samaria.
111Kg 16:33 Then he set up an Asherah pole. He did more to provoke the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, than any of the other kings of Israel before him.
111Kg 16:34 It was during his reign that Hiel, a man from Bethel, rebuilt Jericho. When he laid its foundations, it cost him the life of his oldest son, Abiram. And when he completed it and set up its gates, it cost him the life of his youngest son, Segub��. This all happened according to the message from the LORD concerning Jericho spoken by Joshua son of Nun. / ��An ancient Hebrew scribal tradition reads He killed his oldest son when he laid its foundations, and he killed his youngest son when he set up its gates
111Kg 17:1 Now Elijah, who was from Tishbe in Gilead, told King Ahab, "As surely as the LORD, the God of Israel, lives - the God I serve - there will be no dew or rain during the next few years until I give the word!"
111Kg 17:2 Then the LORD said to Elijah,
111Kg 17:3 "Go to the east and hide by Kerith Brook, near where it enters the Jordan River.
111Kg 17:4 Drink from the brook and eat what the ravens bring you, for I have commanded them to bring you food."
111Kg 17:5 So Elijah did as the LORD told him and camped beside Kerith Brook, east of the Jordan.
111Kg 17:6 The ravens brought him bread and meat each morning and evening, and he drank from the brook.
111Kg 17:7 But after a while the brook dried up, for there was no rainfall anywhere in the land.
111Kg 17:8 Then the LORD said to Elijah,
111Kg 17:9 "Go and live in the village of Zarephath, near the city of Sidon. I have instructed a widow there to feed you."
111Kg 17:10 So he went to Zarephath. As he arrived at the gates of the village, he saw a widow gathering sticks, and he asked her, "Would you please bring me a little water in a cup?"
111Kg 17:11 As she was going to get it, he called to her, "Bring me a bite of bread, too."
111Kg 17:12 But she said, "I swear by the LORD your God that I don't have a single piece of bread in the house. And I have only a handful of flour left in the jar and a little cooking oil in the bottom of the jug. I was just gathering a few sticks to cook this last meal, and then my son and I will die."
111Kg 17:13 But Elijah said to her, "Don't be afraid! Go ahead and do just what you've said, but make a little bread for me first. Then use what's left to prepare a meal for yourself and your son.
111Kg 17:14 For this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says�� There will always be flour and olive oil left in your containers until the time when the LORD sends rain and the crops grow again!"
111Kg 17:15 So she did as Elijah said, and she and Elijah and her family continued to eat for many days.
111Kg 17:16 There was always enough flour and olive oil left in the containers, just as the LORD had promised through Elijah.
111Kg 17:17 Some time later the woman's son became sick. He grew worse and worse, and finally he died.
111Kg 17:18 Then she said to Elijah, "O man of God, what have you done to me? Have you come here to point out my sins and kill my son?"
111Kg 17:19 But Elijah replied, "Give me your son." And he took the child's body from her arms, carried him up the stairs to the room where he was staying, and laid the body on his bed.
111Kg 17:20 Then Elijah cried out to the LORD, "O LORD my God, why have you brought tragedy to this widow who has opened her home to me, causing her son to die?"
111Kg 17:21 And he stretched himself out over the child three times and cried out to the LORD, "O LORD my God, please let this child's life return to him."
111Kg 17:22 The LORD heard Elijah's prayer, and the life of the child returned, and he revived!
111Kg 17:23 Then Elijah brought him down from the upper room and gave him to his mother. "Look!" he said. "Your son is alive!"
111Kg 17:24 Then the woman told Elijah, "Now I know for sure that you are a man of God, and that the LORD truly speaks through you."
111Kg 18:1 Later on, in the third year of the drought, the LORD said to Elijah, "Go and present yourself to King Ahab. Tell him that I will soon send rain!"
111Kg 18:2 So Elijah went to appear before Ahab.Meanwhile, the famine had become very severe in Samaria.
111Kg 18:3 So Ahab summoned Obadiah, who was in charge of the palace. (Obadiah was a devoted follower of the LORD.
111Kg 18:4 Once when Jezebel had tried to kill all the LORD's prophets, Obadiah had hidden 100 of them in two caves. He put fifty prophets in each cave and supplied them with food and water.)
111Kg 18:5 Ahab said to Obadiah, "We must check every spring and valley in the land to see if we can find enough grass to save at least some of my horses and mules."
111Kg 18:6 So they divided the land between them. Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.
111Kg 18:7 As Obadiah was walking along, he suddenly saw Elijah coming toward him. Obadiah recognized him at once and bowed low to the ground before him. "Is it really you, my lord Elijah?" he asked.
111Kg 18:8 "Yes, it is," Elijah replied. "Now go and tell your master, 'Elijah is here.'"
111Kg 18:9 "Oh, sir," Obadiah protested, "what harm have I done to you that you are sending me to my death at the hands of Ahab?
111Kg 18:10 For I swear by the LORD your God that the king has searched every nation and kingdom on earth from end to end to find you. And each time he was told, 'Elijah isn't here,' King Ahab forced the king of that nation to swear to the truth of his claim.
111Kg 18:11 And now you say, 'Go and tell your master, "Elijah is here."'
111Kg 18:12 But as soon as I leave you, the Spirit of the LORD will carry you away to who knows where. When Ahab comes and cannot find you, he will kill me. Yet I have been a true servant of the LORD all my life.
111Kg 18:13 Has no one told you, my lord, about the time when Jezebel was trying to kill the LORD's prophets? I hid 100 of them in two caves and supplied them with food and water.
111Kg 18:14 And now you say, 'Go and tell your master, "Elijah is here."' Sir, if I do that, Ahab will certainly kill me."
111Kg 18:15 But Elijah said, "I swear by the LORD Almighty, in whose presence I stand, that I will present myself to Ahab this very day."
111Kg 18:16 So Obadiah went to tell Ahab that Elijah had come, and Ahab went out to meet Elijah.
111Kg 18:17 When Ahab saw him, he exclaimed, "So, is it really you, you troublemaker of Israel?"
111Kg 18:18 "I have made no trouble for Israel," Elijah replied. "You and your family are the troublemakers, for you have refused to obey the commands of the LORD and have worshiped the images of Baal instead.
111Kg 18:19 Now summon all Israel to join me at Mount Carmel, along with the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah who are supported by Jezebel��." / ��Hebrew who eat at Jezebel's table
111Kg 18:20 So Ahab summoned all the people of Israel and the prophets to Mount Carmel.
111Kg 18:21 Then Elijah stood in front of them and said, "How much longer will you waver, hobbling between two opinions? If the LORD is God, follow him! But if Baal is God, then follow him!" But the people were completely silent.
111Kg 18:22 Then Elijah said to them, "I am the only prophet of the LORD who is left, but Baal has 450 prophets.
111Kg 18:23 Now bring two bulls. The prophets of Baal may choose whichever one they wish and cut it into pieces and lay it on the wood of their altar, but without setting fire to it. I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood on the altar, but not set fire to it.
111Kg 18:24 Then call on the name of your god, and I will call on the name of the LORD. The god who answers by setting fire to the wood is the true God!" And all the people agreed.
111Kg 18:25 Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, "You go first, for there are many of you. Choose one of the bulls, and prepare it and call on the name of your god. But do not set fire to the wood."
111Kg 18:26 So they prepared one of the bulls and placed it on the altar. Then they called on the name of Baal from morning until noontime, shouting, "O Baal, answer us!" But there was no reply of any kind. Then they danced, hobbling around the altar they had made.
111Kg 18:27 About noontime Elijah began mocking them. "You'll have to shout louder," he scoffed, "for surely he is a god! Perhaps he is daydreaming, or is relieving himself��. Or maybe he is away on a trip, or is asleep and needs to be wakened!" / ��Or is busy somewhere else, or is engaged in business
111Kg 18:28 So they shouted louder, and following their normal custom, they cut themselves with knives and swords until the blood gushed out.
111Kg 18:29 They raved all afternoon until the time of the evening sacrifice, but still there was no sound, no reply, no response.
111Kg 18:30 Then Elijah called to the people, "Come over here!" They all crowded around him as he repaired the altar of the LORD that had been torn down.
111Kg 18:31 He took twelve stones, one to represent each of the tribes of Israel��, / ��Hebrew each of the tribes of the sons of Jacob to whom the LORD had said, "Your name will be Israel"
111Kg 18:32 and he used the stones to rebuild the altar in the name of the LORD. Then he dug a trench around the altar large enough to hold about three gallons��. / ��Hebrew 2 seahs [12 liters] of seed
111Kg 18:33 He piled wood on the altar, cut the bull into pieces, and laid the pieces on the wood. Then he said, "Fill four large jars with water, and pour the water over the offering and the wood."
111Kg 18:34 After they had done this, he said, "Do the same thing again!" And when they were finished, he said, "Now do it a third time!" So they did as he said,
111Kg 18:35 and the water ran around the altar and even filled the trench.
111Kg 18:36 At the usual time for offering the evening sacrifice, Elijah the prophet walked up to the altar and prayed, "O LORD, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob��, prove today that you are God in Israel and that I am your servant.

The names "Jacob" and "Israel" are often interchanged throughout the Old Testament, referring sometimes to the individual patriarch and sometimes to the nation
111Kg 18:37 O LORD, answer me! Answer me so these people will know that you, O LORD, are God and that you have brought them back to yourself."
111Kg 18:38 Immediately the fire of the LORD flashed down from heaven and burned up the young bull, the wood, the stones, and the dust. It even licked up all the water in the trench!
111Kg 18:39 And when all the people saw it, they fell face down on the ground and cried out, "The LORD - he is God! Yes, the LORD is God!"
111Kg 18:40 Then Elijah commanded, "Seize all the prophets of Baal. Don't let a single one escape!" So the people seized them all, and Elijah took them down to the Kishon Valley and killed them there.
111Kg 18:41 Then Elijah said to Ahab, "Go get something to eat and drink, for I hear a mighty rainstorm coming!"
111Kg 18:42 So Ahab went to eat and drink. But Elijah climbed to the top of Mount Carmel and bowed low to the ground and prayed with his face between his knees.
111Kg 18:43 Then he said to his servant, "Go and look out toward the sea." The servant went and looked, then returned to Elijah and said, "I didn't see anything." Seven times Elijah told him to go and look.
111Kg 18:44 Finally the seventh time, his servant told him, "I saw a little cloud about the size of a man's hand rising from the sea." Then Elijah shouted, "Hurry to Ahab and tell him, 'Climb into your chariot and go back home. If you don't hurry, the rain will stop you!'"
111Kg 18:45 And soon the sky was black with clouds. A heavy wind brought a terrific rainstorm, and Ahab left quickly for Jezreel.
111Kg 18:46 Then the LORD gave special strength to Elijah. He tucked his cloak into his belt�� and ran ahead of Ahab's chariot all the way to the entrance of Jezreel. / ��Hebrew He bound up his loins
111Kg 19:1 When Ahab got home, he told Jezebel everything Elijah had done, including the way he had killed all the prophets of Baal.
111Kg 19:2 So Jezebel sent this message to Elijah�� "May the gods strike me and even kill me if by this time tomorrow I have not killed you just as you killed them."
111Kg 19:3 Elijah was afraid and fled for his life. He went to Beersheba, a town in Judah, and he left his servant there.
111Kg 19:4 Then he went on alone into the wilderness, traveling all day. He sat down under a solitary broom tree and prayed that he might die. "I have had enough, LORD," he said. "Take my life, for I am no better than my ancestors who have already died."
111Kg 19:5 Then he lay down and slept under the broom tree. But as he was sleeping, an angel touched him and told him, "Get up and eat!"
111Kg 19:6 He looked around and there beside his head was some bread baked on hot stones and a jar of water! So he ate and drank and lay down again.
111Kg 19:7 Then the angel of the LORD came again and touched him and said, "Get up and eat some more, or the journey ahead will be too much for you."
111Kg 19:8 So he got up and ate and drank, and the food gave him enough strength to travel forty days and forty nights to Mount Sinai��, the mountain of God. / ��Hebrew to Horeb, another name for Sinai
111Kg 19:9 There he came to a cave, where he spent the night. But the LORD said to him, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
111Kg 19:10 Elijah replied, "I have zealously served the LORD God Almighty. But the people of Israel have broken their covenant with you, torn down your altars, and killed every one of your prophets. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me, too."
111Kg 19:11 "Go out and stand before me on the mountain," the LORD told him. And as Elijah stood there, the LORD passed by, and a mighty windstorm hit the mountain. It was such a terrible blast that the rocks were torn loose, but the LORD was not in the wind. After the wind there was an earthquake, but the LORD was not in the earthquake.
111Kg 19:12 And after the earthquake there was a fire, but the LORD was not in the fire. And after the fire there was the sound of a gentle whisper.
111Kg 19:13 When Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave.And a voice said, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
111Kg 19:14 He replied again, "I have zealously served the LORD God Almighty. But the people of Israel have broken their covenant with you, torn down your altars, and killed every one of your prophets. I am the only one left, and now they are trying to kill me, too."
111Kg 19:15 Then the LORD told him, "Go back the same way you came, and travel to the wilderness of Damascus. When you arrive there, anoint Hazael to be king of Aram.
111Kg 19:16 Then anoint Jehu grandson of Nimshi�� to be king of Israel, and anoint Elisha son of Shaphat from the town of Abel-meholah to replace you as my prophet. / ��Hebrew descendant of Nimshi; compare 2 Kgs 9.2, 14
111Kg 19:17 Anyone who escapes from Hazael will be killed by Jehu, and those who escape Jehu will be killed by Elisha!
111Kg 19:18 Yet I will preserve 7,000 others in Israel who have never bowed down to Baal or kissed him!"
111Kg 19:19 So Elijah went and found Elisha son of Shaphat plowing a field. There were twelve teams of oxen in the field, and Elisha was plowing with the twelfth team. Elijah went over to him and threw his cloak across his shoulders and then walked away.
111Kg 19:20 Elisha left the oxen standing there, ran after Elijah, and said to him, "First let me go and kiss my father and mother good-bye, and then I will go with you!" Elijah replied, "Go on back, but think about what I have done to you."
111Kg 19:21 So Elisha returned to his oxen and slaughtered them. He used the wood from the plow to build a fire to roast their flesh. He passed around the meat to the townspeople, and they all ate. Then he went with Elijah as his assistant.
111Kg 20:1 About that time King Ben-hadad of Aram mobilized his army, supported by the chariots and horses of thirty-two allied kings. They went to besiege Samaria, the capital of Israel, and launched attacks against it.
111Kg 20:2 Ben-hadad sent messengers into the city to relay this message to King Ahab of Israel�� "This is what Ben-hadad says.
111Kg 20:3 'Your silver and gold are mine, and so are your wives and the best of your children!'"
111Kg 20:4 "All right, my lord the king," Israel's king replied. "All that I have is yours!"
111Kg 20:5 Soon Ben-hadad's messengers returned again and said, "This is what Ben-hadad says�� 'I have already demanded that you give me your silver, gold, wives, and children.
111Kg 20:6 But about this time tomorrow I will send my officials to search your palace and the homes of your people. They will take away everything you consider valuable!'"
111Kg 20:7 Then Ahab summoned all the elders of the land and said to them, "Look how this man is stirring up trouble! I already agreed with his demand that I give him my wives and children and silver and gold."
111Kg 20:8 "Don't give in to any more demands," all the elders and the people advised.
111Kg 20:9 So Ahab told the messengers from Ben-hadad, "Say this to my lord the king�� 'I will give you everything you asked for the first time, but I cannot accept this last demand of yours.'" So the messengers returned to Ben-hadad with that response.
111Kg 20:10 Then Ben-hadad sent this message to Ahab�� "May the gods strike me and even kill me if there remains enough dust from Samaria to provide even a handful for each of my soldiers."
111Kg 20:11 The king of Israel sent back this answer�� "A warrior putting on his sword for battle should not boast like a warrior who has already won."
111Kg 20:12 Ahab's reply reached Ben-hadad and the other kings as they were drinking in their tents��. "Prepare to attack!" Ben-hadad commanded his officers. So they prepared to attack the city. / ��Or in Succoth; also in 20.16
111Kg 20:13 Then a certain prophet came to see King Ahab of Israel and told him, "This is what the LORD says�� Do you see all these enemy forces? Today I will hand them all over to you. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
111Kg 20:14 Ahab asked, "How will he do it?" And the prophet replied, "This is what the LORD says�� The troops of the provincial commanders will do it." "Should we attack first?" Ahab asked."Yes," the prophet answered.
111Kg 20:15 So Ahab mustered the troops of the 232 provincial commanders. Then he called out the rest of the army of Israel, some 7,000 men.
111Kg 20:16 About noontime, as Ben-hadad and the thirty-two allied kings were still in their tents drinking themselves into a stupor,
111Kg 20:17 the troops of the provincial commanders marched out of the city as the first contingent.As they approached, Ben-hadad's scouts reported to him, "Some troops are coming from Samaria."
111Kg 20:18 "Take them alive," Ben-hadad commanded, "whether they have come for peace or for war."
111Kg 20:19 But Ahab's provincial commanders and the entire army had now come out to fight.
111Kg 20:20 Each Israelite soldier killed his Aramean opponent, and suddenly the entire Aramean army panicked and fled. The Israelites chased them, but King Ben-hadad and a few of his charioteers escaped on horses.
111Kg 20:21 However, the king of Israel destroyed the other horses and chariots and slaughtered the Arameans.
111Kg 20:22 Afterward the prophet said to King Ahab, "Get ready for another attack. Begin making plans now, for the king of Aram will come back next spring��." / ��Hebrew at the turn of the year; similarly in 20.26. The first day of the year in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in March or April
111Kg 20:23 After their defeat, Ben-hadad's officers said to him, "The Israelite gods are gods of the hills; that is why they won. But we can beat them easily on the plains.
111Kg 20:24 Only this time replace the kings with field commanders!
111Kg 20:25 Recruit another army like the one you lost. Give us the same number of horses, chariots, and men, and we will fight against them on the plains. There's no doubt that we will beat them." So King Ben-hadad did as they suggested.
111Kg 20:26 The following spring he called up the Aramean army and marched out against Israel, this time at Aphek.
111Kg 20:27 Israel then mustered its army, set up supply lines, and marched out for battle. But the Israelite army looked like two little flocks of goats in comparison to the vast Aramean forces that filled the countryside!
111Kg 20:28 Then the man of God went to the king of Israel and said, "This is what the LORD says�� The Arameans have said, 'The LORD is a god of the hills and not of the plains.' So I will defeat this vast army for you. Then you will know that I am the LORD."
111Kg 20:29 The two armies camped opposite each other for seven days, and on the seventh day the battle began. The Israelites killed 100,000 Aramean foot soldiers in one day.
111Kg 20:30 The rest fled into the town of Aphek, but the wall fell on them and killed another 27,000. Ben-hadad fled into the town and hid in a secret room.
111Kg 20:31 Ben-hadad's officers said to him, "Sir, we have heard that the kings of Israel are merciful. So let's humble ourselves by wearing burlap around our waists and putting ropes on our heads, and surrender to the king of Israel. Then perhaps he will let you live."
111Kg 20:32 So they put on burlap and ropes, and they went to the king of Israel and begged, "Your servant Ben-hadad says, 'Please let me live!'" The king of Israel responded, "Is he still alive? He is my brother!"
111Kg 20:33 The men took this as a good sign and quickly picked up on his words. "Yes," they said, "your brother Ben-hadad!" "Go and get him," the king of Israel told them. And when Ben-hadad arrived, Ahab invited him up into his chariot.
111Kg 20:34 Ben-hadad told him, "I will give back the towns my father took from your father, and you may establish places of trade in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria." Then Ahab said, "I will release you under these conditions." So they made a new treaty, and Ben-hadad was set free.
111Kg 20:35 Meanwhile, the LORD instructed one of the group of prophets to say to another man, "Hit me!" But the man refused to hit the prophet.
111Kg 20:36 Then the prophet told him, "Because you have not obeyed the voice of the LORD, a lion will kill you as soon as you leave me." And when he had gone, a lion did attack and kill him.
111Kg 20:37 Then the prophet turned to another man and said, "Hit me!" So he struck the prophet and wounded him.
111Kg 20:38 The prophet placed a bandage over his eyes to disguise himself and then waited beside the road for the king.
111Kg 20:39 As the king passed by, the prophet called out to him, "Sir, I was in the thick of battle, and suddenly a man brought me a prisoner. He said, 'Guard this man; if for any reason he gets away, you will either die or pay a fine of seventy-five pounds�� of silver!' / ��Hebrew 1 talent [34 kilograms]
111Kg 20:40 But while I was busy doing something else, the prisoner disappeared!" "Well, it's your own fault," the king replied. "You have brought the judgment on yourself."
111Kg 20:41 Then the prophet quickly pulled the bandage from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets.
111Kg 20:42 The prophet said to him, "This is what the LORD says�� Because you have spared the man I said must be destroyed��, now you must die in his place, and your people will die instead of his people." / ��The Hebrew term used here refers to the complete consecration of things or people to the LORD, either by destroying them or by giving them as an offering
111Kg 20:43 So the king of Israel went home to Samaria angry and sullen.
111Kg 21:1 Now there was a man named Naboth, from Jezreel, who owned a vineyard in Jezreel beside the palace of King Ahab of Samaria.
111Kg 21:2 One day Ahab said to Naboth, "Since your vineyard is so convenient to my palace, I would like to buy it to use as a vegetable garden. I will give you a better vineyard in exchange, or if you prefer, I will pay you for it."
111Kg 21:3 But Naboth replied, "The LORD forbid that I should give you the inheritance that was passed down by my ancestors."
111Kg 21:4 So Ahab went home angry and sullen because of Naboth's answer. The king went to bed with his face to the wall and refused to eat!
111Kg 21:5 "What's the matter?" his wife Jezebel asked him. "What's made you so upset that you're not eating?"
111Kg 21:6 "I asked Naboth to sell me his vineyard or trade it, but he refused!" Ahab told her.
111Kg 21:7 "Are you the king of Israel or not?" Jezebel demanded. "Get up and eat something, and don't worry about it. I'll get you Naboth's vineyard!"
111Kg 21:8 So she wrote letters in Ahab's name, sealed them with his seal, and sent them to the elders and other leaders of the town where Naboth lived.
111Kg 21:9 In her letters she commanded�� "Call the citizens together for fasting and prayer, and give Naboth a place of honor.
111Kg 21:10 And then seat two scoundrels across from him who will accuse him of cursing God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death."
111Kg 21:11 So the elders and other town leaders followed the instructions Jezebel had written in the letters.
111Kg 21:12 They called for a fast and put Naboth at a prominent place before the people.
111Kg 21:13 Then the two scoundrels came and sat down across from him. And they accused Naboth before all the people, saying, "He cursed God and the king." So he was dragged outside the town and stoned to death.
111Kg 21:14 The town leaders then sent word to Jezebel, "Naboth has been stoned to death."
111Kg 21:15 When Jezebel heard the news, she said to Ahab, "You know the vineyard Naboth wouldn't sell you? Well, you can have it now! He's dead!"
111Kg 21:16 So Ahab immediately went down to the vineyard of Naboth to claim it.
111Kg 21:17 But the LORD said to Elijah��, / ��Hebrew Elijah the Tishbite; also in 21.28
111Kg 21:18 "Go down to meet King Ahab of Israel, who rules in Samaria. He will be at Naboth's vineyard in Jezreel, claiming it for himself.
111Kg 21:19 Give him this message�� 'This is what the LORD says�� Wasn't it enough that you killed Naboth? Must you rob him, too? Because you have done this, dogs will lick your blood at the very place where they licked the blood of Naboth!'"
111Kg 21:20 "So, my enemy, you have found me!" Ahab exclaimed to Elijah."Yes," Elijah answered, "I have come because you have sold yourself to what is evil in the LORD's sight.
111Kg 21:21 So now the LORD says, 'I will bring disaster on you and consume you. I will destroy every one of your male descendants, slave and free alike, anywhere in Israel!
111Kg 21:22 I am going to destroy your family as I did the family of Jeroboam son of Nebat and the family of Baasha son of Ahijah, for you have made me very angry and have led Israel into sin.'
111Kg 21:23 "And regarding Jezebel, the LORD says, 'Dogs will eat Jezebel's body at the plot of land in Jezreel��.' / ��As in several Hebrew manuscripts, Syriac, and Latin Vulgate (see also 2 Kgs 9.26, 36); most Hebrew manuscripts read at the city wall
111Kg 21:24 "The members of Ahab's family who die in the city will be eaten by dogs, and those who die in the field will be eaten by vultures."
111Kg 21:25 (No one else so completely sold himself to what was evil in the LORD's sight as Ahab did under the influence of his wife Jezebel.
111Kg 21:26 His worst outrage was worshiping idols�� just as the Amorites had done - the people whom the LORD had driven out from the land ahead of the Israelites.) / ��The Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung
111Kg 21:27 But when Ahab heard this message, he tore his clothing, dressed in burlap, and fasted. He even slept in burlap and went about in deep mourning.
111Kg 21:28 Then another message from the LORD came to Elijah.
111Kg 21:29 "Do you see how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has done this, I will not do what I promised during his lifetime. It will happen to his sons; I will destroy his dynasty."
111Kg 22:1 For three years there was no war between Aram and Israel.
111Kg 22:2 Then during the third year, King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit King Ahab of Israel.
111Kg 22:3 During the visit, the king of Israel said to his officials, "Do you realize that the town of Ramoth-gilead belongs to us? And yet we've done nothing to recapture it from the king of Aram!"
111Kg 22:4 Then he turned to Jehoshaphat and asked, "Will you join me in battle to recover Ramoth-gilead?" Jehoshaphat replied to the king of Israel, "Why, of course! You and I are as one. My troops are your troops, and my horses are your horses."
111Kg 22:5 Then Jehoshaphat added, "But first let's find out what the LORD says."
111Kg 22:6 So the king of Israel summoned the prophets, about 400 of them, and asked them, "Should I go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold back?" They all replied, "Yes, go right ahead! The Lord will give the king victory."
111Kg 22:7 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not also a prophet of the LORD here? We should ask him the same question."
111Kg 22:8 The king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat, "There is one more man who could consult the LORD for us, but I hate him. He never prophesies anything but trouble for me! His name is Micaiah son of Imlah." Jehoshaphat replied, "That's not the way a king should talk! Let's hear what he has to say."
111Kg 22:9 So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Quick! Bring Micaiah son of Imlah."
111Kg 22:10 King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on thrones at the threshing floor near the gate of Samaria. All of Ahab's prophets were prophesying there in front of them.
111Kg 22:11 One of them, Zedekiah son of Kenaanah, made some iron horns and proclaimed, "This is what the LORD says�� With these horns you will gore the Arameans to death!"
111Kg 22:12 All the other prophets agreed. "Yes," they said, "go up to Ramoth-gilead and be victorious, for the LORD will give the king victory!"
111Kg 22:13 Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah said to him, "Look, all the prophets are promising victory for the king. Be sure that you agree with them and promise success."
111Kg 22:14 But Micaiah replied, "As surely as the LORD lives, I will say only what the LORD tells me to say."
111Kg 22:15 When Micaiah arrived before the king, Ahab asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should we hold back?" Micaiah replied sarcastically, "Yes, go up and be victorious, for the LORD will give the king victory!"
111Kg 22:16 But the king replied sharply, "How many times must I demand that you speak only the truth to me when you speak for the LORD?"
111Kg 22:17 Then Micaiah told him, "In a vision I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd. And the LORD said, 'Their master has been killed��. Send them home in peace.'" / ��Hebrew These people have no master
111Kg 22:18 "Didn't I tell you?" the king of Israel exclaimed to Jehoshaphat. "He never prophesies anything but trouble for me."
111Kg 22:19 Then Micaiah continued, "Listen to what the LORD says! I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the armies of heaven around him, on his right and on his left.
111Kg 22:20 And the LORD said, 'Who can entice Ahab to go into battle against Ramoth-gilead so he can be killed?' "There were many suggestions,
111Kg 22:21 and finally a spirit approached the LORD and said, 'I can do it!'
111Kg 22:22 "'How will you do this?' the LORD asked. "And the spirit replied, 'I will go out and inspire all of Ahab's prophets to speak lies.' "'You will succeed,' said the LORD. 'Go ahead and do it.'
111Kg 22:23 "So you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of all your prophets. For the LORD has pronounced your doom."
111Kg 22:24 Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him across the face. "Since when did the Spirit of the LORD leave me to speak to you?" he demanded.
111Kg 22:25 And Micaiah replied, "You will find out soon enough when you are trying to hide in some secret room!"
111Kg 22:26 "Arrest him!" the king of Israel ordered. "Take him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to my son Joash.
111Kg 22:27 Give them this order from the king�� 'Put this man in prison, and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return safely from the battle!'"
111Kg 22:28 But Micaiah replied, "If you return safely, it will mean that the LORD has not spoken through me!" Then he added to those standing around, "Everyone mark my words!"
111Kg 22:29 So King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah led their armies against Ramoth-gilead.
111Kg 22:30 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "As we go into battle, I will disguise myself so no one will recognize me, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
111Kg 22:31 Meanwhile, the king of Aram had issued these orders to his thirty-two chariot commanders�� "Attack only the king of Israel. Don't bother with anyone else!"
111Kg 22:32 So when the Aramean chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes, they went after him. "There is the king of Israel!" they shouted. But when Jehoshaphat called out,
111Kg 22:33 the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, and they stopped chasing him.
111Kg 22:34 An Aramean soldier, however, randomly shot an arrow at the Israelite troops and hit the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. "Turn the horses�� and get me out of here!" Ahab groaned to the driver of his chariot. "I'm badly wounded!" / ��Hebrew Turn your hand
111Kg 22:35 The battle raged all that day, and the king remained propped up in his chariot facing the Arameans. The blood from his wound ran down to the floor of his chariot, and as evening arrived he died.
111Kg 22:36 Just as the sun was setting, the cry ran through his troops�� "We're done for! Run for your lives!"
111Kg 22:37 So the king died, and his body was taken to Samaria and buried there.
111Kg 22:38 Then his chariot was washed beside the pool of Samaria, and dogs came and licked his blood at the place where the prostitutes bathed��, just as the LORD had promised. / ��Or his blood, and the prostitutes bathed [in it]; or his blood, and they washed his armor
111Kg 22:39 The rest of the events in Ahab's reign and everything he did, including the story of the ivory palace and the towns he built, are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.
111Kg 22:40 So Ahab died, and his son Ahaziah became the next king.
111Kg 22:41 Jehoshaphat son of Asa began to rule over Judah in the fourth year of King Ahab's reign in Israel.
111Kg 22:42 Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
111Kg 22:43 Jehoshaphat was a good king, following the example of his father, Asa. He did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight. ��During his reign, however, he failed to remove all the pagan shrines, and the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there. / ��Verses 22.43b-53 are numbered 22.44-54 in Hebrew text
111Kg 22:44 Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel.
111Kg 22:45 The rest of the events in Jehoshaphat's reign, the extent of his power, and the wars he waged are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.
111Kg 22:46 He banished from the land the rest of the male and female shrine prostitutes, who still continued their practices from the days of his father, Asa.
111Kg 22:47 (There was no king in Edom at that time, only a deputy.)
111Kg 22:48 Jehoshaphat also built a fleet of trading ships�� to sail to Ophir for gold. But the ships never set sail, for they met with disaster in their home port of Ezion-geber. / ��Hebrew fleet of ships of Tarshish
111Kg 22:49 At one time Ahaziah son of Ahab had proposed to Jehoshaphat, "Let my men sail with your men in the ships." But Jehoshaphat refused the request.
111Kg 22:50 When Jehoshaphat died, he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Jehoram became the next king.
111Kg 22:51 Ahaziah son of Ahab began to rule over Israel in the seventeenth year of King Jehoshaphat's reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria two years.
111Kg 22:52 But he did what was evil in the LORD's sight, following the example of his father and mother and the example of Jeroboam son of Nebat, who had led Israel to sin.
111Kg 22:53 He served Baal and worshiped him, provoking the anger of the LORD, the God of Israel, just as his father had done.
12
122Kg 1:1 After King Ahab's death, the land of Moab rebelled against Israel.
122Kg 1:2 One day Israel's new king, Ahaziah, fell through the latticework of an upper room at his palace in Samaria and was seriously injured. So he sent messengers to the temple of Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, to ask whether he would recover.
122Kg 1:3 But the angel of the LORD told Elijah, who was from Tishbe, "Go and confront the messengers of the king of Samaria and ask them, 'Is there no God in Israel? Why are you going to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, to ask whether the king will recover?
122Kg 1:4 Now, therefore, this is what the LORD says�� You will never leave the bed you are lying on; you will surely die.'" So Elijah went to deliver the message.
122Kg 1:5 When the messengers returned to the king, he asked them, "Why have you returned so soon?"
122Kg 1:6 They replied, "A man came up to us and told us to go back to the king and give him this message. 'This is what the LORD says�� Is there no God in Israel? Why are you sending men to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, to ask whether you will recover? Therefore, because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on; you will surely die.'"
122Kg 1:7 "What sort of man was he?" the king demanded. "What did he look like?"
122Kg 1:8 They replied, "He was a hairy man��, and he wore a leather belt around his waist." "Elijah from Tishbe!" the king exclaimed. / ��Or He was wearing clothing made of hair
122Kg 1:9 Then he sent an army captain with fifty soldiers to arrest him. They found him sitting on top of a hill. The captain said to him, "Man of God, the king has commanded you to come down with us."
122Kg 1:10 But Elijah replied to the captain, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and destroy you and your fifty men!" Then fire fell from heaven and killed them all.
122Kg 1:11 So the king sent another captain with fifty men. The captain said to him, "Man of God, the king demands that you come down at once."
122Kg 1:12 Elijah replied, "If I am a man of God, let fire come down from heaven and destroy you and your fifty men!" And again the fire of God fell from heaven and killed them all.
122Kg 1:13 Once more the king sent a third captain with fifty men. But this time the captain went up the hill and fell to his knees before Elijah. He pleaded with him, "O man of God, please spare my life and the lives of these, your fifty servants.
122Kg 1:14 See how the fire from heaven came down and destroyed the first two groups. But now please spare my life!"
122Kg 1:15 Then the angel of the LORD said to Elijah, "Go down with him, and don't be afraid of him." So Elijah got up and went with him to the king.
122Kg 1:16 And Elijah said to the king, "This is what the LORD says�� Why did you send messengers to Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron, to ask whether you will recover? Is there no God in Israel to answer your question? Therefore, because you have done this, you will never leave the bed you are lying on; you will surely die."
122Kg 1:17 So Ahaziah died, just as the LORD had promised through Elijah. Since Ahaziah did not have a son to succeed him, his brother Joram�� became the next king. This took place in the second year of the reign of Jehoram son of Jehoshaphat, king of Judah. / ��Hebrew Jehoram, a variant spelling of Joram
122Kg 1:18 The rest of the events in Ahaziah's reign are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 2:1 When the LORD was about to take Elijah up to heaven in a whirlwind, Elijah and Elisha were traveling from Gilgal.
122Kg 2:2 And Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here, for the LORD has told me to go to Bethel." But Elisha replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, I will never leave you!" So they went down together to Bethel.
122Kg 2:3 The group of prophets from Bethel came to Elisha and asked him, "Did you know that the LORD is going to take your master away from you today?" "Of course I know," Elisha answered. "But be quiet about it."
122Kg 2:4 Then Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here, for the LORD has told me to go to Jericho." But Elisha replied again, "As surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, I will never leave you." So they went on together to Jericho.
122Kg 2:5 Then the group of prophets from Jericho came to Elisha and asked him, "Did you know that the LORD is going to take your master away from you today?" "Of course I know," Elisha answered. "But be quiet about it."
122Kg 2:6 Then Elijah said to Elisha, "Stay here, for the LORD has told me to go to the Jordan River." But again Elisha replied, "As surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, I will never leave you." So they went on together.
122Kg 2:7 Fifty men from the group of prophets also went and watched from a distance as Elijah and Elisha stopped beside the Jordan River.
122Kg 2:8 Then Elijah folded his cloak together and struck the water with it. The river divided, and the two of them went across on dry ground!
122Kg 2:9 When they came to the other side, Elijah said to Elisha, "Tell me what I can do for you before I am taken away." And Elisha replied, "Please let me inherit a double share of your spirit and become your successor."
122Kg 2:10 "You have asked a difficult thing," Elijah replied. "If you see me when I am taken from you, then you will get your request. But if not, then you won't."
122Kg 2:11 As they were walking along and talking, suddenly a chariot of fire appeared, drawn by horses of fire. It drove between the two men, separating them, and Elijah was carried by a whirlwind into heaven.
122Kg 2:12 Elisha saw it and cried out, "My father! My father! I see the chariots and charioteers of Israel!" And as they disappeared from sight, Elisha tore his clothes in distress.
122Kg 2:13 Elisha picked up Elijah's cloak, which had fallen when he was taken up. Then Elisha returned to the bank of the Jordan River.
122Kg 2:14 He struck the water with Elijah's cloak and cried out, "Where is the LORD, the God of Elijah?" Then the river divided, and Elisha went across.
122Kg 2:15 When the group of prophets from Jericho saw from a distance what happened, they exclaimed, "Elijah's spirit rests upon Elisha!" And they went to meet him and bowed to the ground before him.
122Kg 2:16 "Sir," they said, "just say the word and fifty of our strongest men will search the wilderness for your master. Perhaps the Spirit of the LORD has left him on some mountain or in some valley." "No," Elisha said, "don't send them."
122Kg 2:17 But they kept urging him until they shamed him into agreeing, and he finally said, "All right, send them." So fifty men searched for three days but did not find Elijah.
122Kg 2:18 Elisha was still at Jericho when they returned. "Didn't I tell you not to go?" he asked.
122Kg 2:19 One day the leaders of the town of Jericho visited Elisha. "We have a problem, my lord," they told him. "This town is located in pleasant surroundings, as you can see. But the water is bad, and the land is unproductive."
122Kg 2:20 Elisha said, "Bring me a new bowl with salt in it." So they brought it to him.
122Kg 2:21 Then he went out to the spring that supplied the town with water and threw the salt into it. And he said, "This is what the LORD says�� I have purified this water. It will no longer cause death or infertility��." / ��Or or make the land unproductive; Hebrew reads or barrenness
122Kg 2:22 And the water has remained pure ever since, just as Elisha said.
122Kg 2:23 Elisha left Jericho and went up to Bethel. As he was walking along the road, a group of boys from the town began mocking and making fun of him. "Go away, baldy!" they chanted. "Go away, baldy!"
122Kg 2:24 Elisha turned around and looked at them, and he cursed them in the name of the LORD. Then two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty-two of them.
122Kg 2:25 From there Elisha went to Mount Carmel and finally returned to Samaria.
122Kg 3:1 Ahab's son Joram�� began to rule over Israel in the eighteenth year of King Jehoshaphat's reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria twelve years. / ��Hebrew Jehoram, a variant spelling of Joram; also in 3.6
122Kg 3:2 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, but not to the same extent as his father and mother. He at least tore down the sacred pillar of Baal that his father had set up.
122Kg 3:3 Nevertheless, he continued in the sins that Jeroboam son of Nebat had committed and led the people of Israel to commit.
122Kg 3:4 King Mesha of Moab was a sheep breeder. He used to pay the king of Israel an annual tribute of 100,000 lambs and the wool of 100,000 rams.
122Kg 3:5 But after Ahab's death, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel.
122Kg 3:6 So King Joram promptly mustered the army of Israel and marched from Samaria.
122Kg 3:7 On the way, he sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah�� "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you join me in battle against him?" And Jehoshaphat replied, "Why, of course! You and I are as one. My troops are your troops, and my horses are your horses."
122Kg 3:8 Then Jehoshaphat asked, "What route will we take?" "We will attack from the wilderness of Edom," Joram replied.
122Kg 3:9 The king of Edom and his troops joined them, and all three armies traveled along a roundabout route through the wilderness for seven days. But there was no water for the men or their animals.
122Kg 3:10 "What should we do?" the king of Israel cried out. "The LORD has brought the three of us here to let the king of Moab defeat us."
122Kg 3:11 But King Jehoshaphat of Judah asked, "Is there no prophet of the LORD with us? If there is, we can ask the LORD what to do through him." One of King Joram's officers replied, "Elisha son of Shaphat is here. He used to be Elijah's personal assistant��." / ��Hebrew He used to pour water on the hands of Elijah
122Kg 3:12 Jehoshaphat said, "Yes, the LORD speaks through him." So the kings of Israel, Judah, and Edom went to consult with Elisha.
122Kg 3:13 "Why are you coming to me?"�� Elisha asked the king of Israel. "Go to the pagan prophets of your father and mother!" But King Joram of Israel said, "No! For it was the LORD who called us three kings here - only to be defeated by the king of Moab!" / ��Hebrew What is there in common between you and me?
122Kg 3:14 Elisha replied, "As surely as the LORD Almighty lives, whom I serve, I wouldn't even bother with you except for my respect for King Jehoshaphat of Judah.
122Kg 3:15 Now bring me someone who can play the harp." While the harp was being played, the power�� of the LORD came upon Elisha, / ��Hebrew the hand
122Kg 3:16 and he said, "This is what the LORD says�� This dry valley will be filled with pools of water!
122Kg 3:17 You will see neither wind nor rain, says the LORD, but this valley will be filled with water. You will have plenty for yourselves and your cattle and other animals.
122Kg 3:18 But this is only a simple thing for the LORD, for he will make you victorious over the army of Moab!
122Kg 3:19 You will conquer the best of their towns, even the fortified ones. You will cut down all their good trees, stop up all their springs, and ruin all their good land with stones."
122Kg 3:20 The next day at about the time when the morning sacrifice was offered, water suddenly appeared! It was flowing from the direction of Edom, and soon there was water everywhere.
122Kg 3:21 Meanwhile, when the people of Moab heard about the three armies marching against them, they mobilized every man who was old enough to strap on a sword, and they stationed themselves along their border.
122Kg 3:22 But when they got up the next morning, the sun was shining across the water, making it appear red to the Moabites - like blood.
122Kg 3:23 "It's blood!" the Moabites exclaimed. "The three armies must have attacked and killed each other! Let's go, men of Moab, and collect the plunder!"
122Kg 3:24 But when the Moabites arrived at the Israelite camp, the army of Israel rushed out and attacked them until they turned and ran. The army of Israel chased them into the land of Moab, destroying everything as they went��. / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
122Kg 3:25 They destroyed the towns, covered their good land with stones, stopped up all the springs, and cut down all the good trees. Finally, only Kir-hareseth and its stone walls were left, but men with slings surrounded and attacked it.
122Kg 3:26 When the king of Moab saw that he was losing the battle, he led 700 of his swordsmen in a desperate attempt to break through the enemy lines near the king of Edom, but they failed.
122Kg 3:27 Then the king of Moab took his oldest son, who would have been the next king, and sacrificed him as a burnt offering on the wall. So there was great anger against Israel��, and the Israelites withdrew and returned to their own land. / ��Or So Israel's anger was great. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
122Kg 4:1 One day the widow of a member of the group of prophets came to Elisha and cried out, "My husband who served you is dead, and you know how he feared the LORD. But now a creditor has come, threatening to take my two sons as slaves."
122Kg 4:2 "What can I do to help you?" Elisha asked. "Tell me, what do you have in the house?" "Nothing at all, except a flask of olive oil," she replied.
122Kg 4:3 And Elisha said, "Borrow as many empty jars as you can from your friends and neighbors.
122Kg 4:4 Then go into your house with your sons and shut the door behind you. Pour olive oil from your flask into the jars, setting each one aside when it is filled."
122Kg 4:5 So she did as she was told. Her sons kept bringing jars to her, and she filled one after another.
122Kg 4:6 Soon every container was full to the brim! "Bring me another jar," she said to one of her sons."There aren't any more!" he told her. And then the olive oil stopped flowing.
122Kg 4:7 When she told the man of God what had happened, he said to her, "Now sell the olive oil and pay your debts, and you and your sons can live on what is left over."
122Kg 4:8 One day Elisha went to the town of Shunem. A wealthy woman lived there, and she urged him to come to her home for a meal. After that, whenever he passed that way, he would stop there for something to eat.
122Kg 4:9 She said to her husband, "I am sure this man who stops in from time to time is a holy man of God.
122Kg 4:10 Let's build a small room for him on the roof and furnish it with a bed, a table, a chair, and a lamp. Then he will have a place to stay whenever he comes by."
122Kg 4:11 One day Elisha returned to Shunem, and he went up to this upper room to rest.
122Kg 4:12 He said to his servant Gehazi, "Tell the woman from Shunem I want to speak to her." When she appeared,
122Kg 4:13 Elisha said to Gehazi, "Tell her, 'We appreciate the kind concern you have shown us. What can we do for you? Can we put in a good word for you to the king or to the commander of the army?'" "No," she replied, "my family takes good care of me."
122Kg 4:14 Later Elisha asked Gehazi, "What can we do for her?" Gehazi replied, "She doesn't have a son, and her husband is an old man."
122Kg 4:15 "Call her back again," Elisha told him. When the woman returned, Elisha said to her as she stood in the doorway,
122Kg 4:16 "Next year at this time you will be holding a son in your arms!" "No, my lord!" she cried. "O man of God, don't deceive me and get my hopes up like that."
122Kg 4:17 But sure enough, the woman soon became pregnant. And at that time the following year she had a son, just as Elisha had said.
122Kg 4:18 One day when her child was older, he went out to help his father, who was working with the harvesters.
122Kg 4:19 Suddenly he cried out, "My head hurts! My head hurts!" His father said to one of the servants, "Carry him home to his mother."
122Kg 4:20 So the servant took him home, and his mother held him on her lap. But around noontime he died.
122Kg 4:21 She carried him up and laid him on the bed of the man of God, then shut the door and left him there.
122Kg 4:22 She sent a message to her husband�� "Send one of the servants and a donkey so that I can hurry to the man of God and come right back."
122Kg 4:23 "Why go today?" he asked. "It is neither a new moon festival nor a Sabbath." But she said, "It will be all right."
122Kg 4:24 So she saddled the donkey and said to the servant, "Hurry! Don't slow down unless I tell you to."
122Kg 4:25 As she approached the man of God at Mount Carmel, Elisha saw her in the distance. He said to Gehazi, "Look, the woman from Shunem is coming.
122Kg 4:26 Run out to meet her and ask her, 'Is everything all right with you, your husband, and your child?'" "Yes," the woman told Gehazi, "everything is fine."
122Kg 4:27 But when she came to the man of God at the mountain, she fell to the ground before him and caught hold of his feet. Gehazi began to push her away, but the man of God said, "Leave her alone. She is deeply troubled, but the LORD has not told me what it is."
122Kg 4:28 Then she said, "Did I ask you for a son, my lord? And didn't I say, 'Don't deceive me and get my hopes up'?"
122Kg 4:29 Then Elisha said to Gehazi, "Get ready to travel��; take my staff and go! Don't talk to anyone along the way. Go quickly and lay the staff on the child's face." / ��Hebrew Bind up your loins
122Kg 4:30 But the boy's mother said, "As surely as the LORD lives and you yourself live, I won't go home unless you go with me." So Elisha returned with her.
122Kg 4:31 Gehazi hurried on ahead and laid the staff on the child's face, but nothing happened. There was no sign of life. He returned to meet Elisha and told him, "The child is still dead."
122Kg 4:32 When Elisha arrived, the child was indeed dead, lying there on the prophet's bed.
122Kg 4:33 He went in alone and shut the door behind him and prayed to the LORD.
122Kg 4:34 Then he lay down on the child's body, placing his mouth on the child's mouth, his eyes on the child's eyes, and his hands on the child's hands. And as he stretched out on him, the child's body began to grow warm again!
122Kg 4:35 Elisha got up, walked back and forth across the room once, and then stretched himself out again on the child. This time the boy sneezed seven times and opened his eyes!
122Kg 4:36 Then Elisha summoned Gehazi. "Call the child's mother!" he said. And when she came in, Elisha said, "Here, take your son!"
122Kg 4:37 She fell at his feet and bowed before him, overwhelmed with gratitude. Then she took her son in her arms and carried him downstairs.
122Kg 4:38 Elisha now returned to Gilgal, and there was a famine in the land. One day as the group of prophets was seated before him, he said to his servant, "Put a large pot on the fire, and make some stew for the rest of the group."
122Kg 4:39 One of the young men went out into the field to gather herbs and came back with a pocketful of wild gourds. He shredded them and put them into the pot without realizing they were poisonous.
122Kg 4:40 Some of the stew was served to the men. But after they had eaten a bite or two they cried out, "Man of God, there's poison in this stew!" So they would not eat it.
122Kg 4:41 Elisha said, "Bring me some flour." Then he threw it into the pot and said, "Now it's all right; go ahead and eat." And then it did not harm them.
122Kg 4:42 One day a man from Baal-shalishah brought the man of God a sack of fresh grain and twenty loaves of barley bread made from the first grain of his harvest. Elisha said, "Give it to the people so they can eat."
122Kg 4:43 "What?" his servant exclaimed. "Feed a hundred people with only this?" But Elisha repeated, "Give it to the people so they can eat, for this is what the LORD says�� Everyone will eat, and there will even be some left over!"
122Kg 4:44 And when they gave it to the people, there was plenty for all and some left over, just as the LORD had promised.
122Kg 5:1 The king of Aram had great admiration for Naaman, the commander of his army, because through him the LORD had given Aram great victories. But though Naaman was a mighty warrior, he suffered from leprosy��. / ��Or from a contagious skin disease. The Hebrew word used here and throughout this passage can describe various skin diseases
122Kg 5:2 At this time Aramean raiders had invaded the land of Israel, and among their captives was a young girl who had been given to Naaman's wife as a maid.
122Kg 5:3 One day the girl said to her mistress, "I wish my master would go to see the prophet in Samaria. He would heal him of his leprosy."
122Kg 5:4 So Naaman told the king what the young girl from Israel had said.
122Kg 5:5 "Go and visit the prophet," the king of Aram told him. "I will send a letter of introduction for you to take to the king of Israel." So Naaman started out, carrying as gifts 750 pounds of silver, 150 pounds of gold��, and ten sets of clothing. / ��Hebrew 10 talents [340 kilograms] of silver, 6,000 shekels [68 kilograms] of gold
122Kg 5:6 The letter to the king of Israel said�� "With this letter I present my servant Naaman. I want you to heal him of his leprosy."
122Kg 5:7 When the king of Israel read the letter, he tore his clothes in dismay and said, "This man sends me a leper to heal! Am I God, that I can give life and take it away? I can see that he's just trying to pick a fight with me."
122Kg 5:8 But when Elisha, the man of God, heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes in dismay, he sent this message to him�� "Why are you so upset? Send Naaman to me, and he will learn that there is a true prophet here in Israel."
122Kg 5:9 So Naaman went with his horses and chariots and waited at the door of Elisha's house.
122Kg 5:10 But Elisha sent a messenger out to him with this message�� "Go and wash yourself seven times in the Jordan River. Then your skin will be restored, and you will be healed of your leprosy."
122Kg 5:11 But Naaman became angry and stalked away. "I thought he would certainly come out to meet me!" he said. "I expected him to wave his hand over the leprosy and call on the name of the LORD his God and heal me!
122Kg 5:12 Aren't the rivers of Damascus, the Abana and the Pharpar, better than any of the rivers of Israel? Why shouldn't I wash in them and be healed?" So Naaman turned and went away in a rage.
122Kg 5:13 But his officers tried to reason with him and said, "Sir��, if the prophet had told you to do something very difficult, wouldn't you have done it? So you should certainly obey him when he says simply, 'Go and wash and be cured!'" / ��Hebrew My father
122Kg 5:14 So Naaman went down to the Jordan River and dipped himself seven times, as the man of God had instructed him. And his skin became as healthy as the skin of a young child's, and he was healed!
122Kg 5:15 Then Naaman and his entire party went back to find the man of God. They stood before him, and Naaman said, "Now I know that there is no God in all the world except in Israel. So please accept a gift from your servant."
122Kg 5:16 But Elisha replied, "As surely as the LORD lives, whom I serve, I will not accept any gifts." And though Naaman urged him to take the gift, Elisha refused.
122Kg 5:17 Then Naaman said, "All right, but please allow me to load two of my mules with earth from this place, and I will take it back home with me. From now on I will never again offer burnt offerings or sacrifices to any other god except the LORD.
122Kg 5:18 However, may the LORD pardon me in this one thing�� When my master the king goes into the temple of the god Rimmon to worship there and leans on my arm, may the LORD pardon me when I bow, too."
122Kg 5:19 "Go in peace," Elisha said. So Naaman started home again.
122Kg 5:20 But Gehazi, the servant of Elisha, the man of God, said to himself, "My master should not have let this Aramean get away without accepting any of his gifts. As surely as the LORD lives, I will chase after him and get something from him."
122Kg 5:21 So Gehazi set off after Naaman.When Naaman saw Gehazi running after him, he climbed down from his chariot and went to meet him. "Is everything all right?" Naaman asked.
122Kg 5:22 "Yes," Gehazi said, "but my master has sent me to tell you that two young prophets from the hill country of Ephraim have just arrived. He would like 75 pounds�� of silver and two sets of clothing to give to them." / ��Hebrew 1 talent [34 kilograms]
122Kg 5:23 "By all means, take twice as much�� silver," Naaman insisted. He gave him two sets of clothing, tied up the money in two bags, and sent two of his servants to carry the gifts for Gehazi. / ��Hebrew take 2 talents [68 kilograms]
122Kg 5:24 But when they arrived at the citadel��, Gehazi took the gifts from the servants and sent the men back. Then he went and hid the gifts inside the house. / ��Hebrew the Ophel
122Kg 5:25 When he went in to his master, Elisha asked him, "Where have you been, Gehazi?" "I haven't been anywhere," he replied.
122Kg 5:26 But Elisha asked him, "Don't you realize that I was there in spirit when Naaman stepped down from his chariot to meet you? Is this the time to receive money and clothing, olive groves and vineyards, sheep and cattle, and male and female servants?
122Kg 5:27 Because you have done this, you and your descendants will suffer from Naaman's leprosy forever." When Gehazi left the room, he was covered with leprosy; his skin was white as snow.
122Kg 6:1 One day the group of prophets came to Elisha and told him, "As you can see, this place where we meet with you is too small.
122Kg 6:2 Let's go down to the Jordan River, where there are plenty of logs. There we can build a new place for us to meet." "All right," he told them, "go ahead."
122Kg 6:3 "Please come with us," someone suggested."I will," he said.
122Kg 6:4 So he went with them.When they arrived at the Jordan, they began cutting down trees.
122Kg 6:5 But as one of them was cutting a tree, his ax head fell into the river. "Oh, sir!" he cried. "It was a borrowed ax!"
122Kg 6:6 "Where did it fall?" the man of God asked. When he showed him the place, Elisha cut a stick and threw it into the water at that spot. Then the ax head floated to the surface.
122Kg 6:7 "Grab it," Elisha said. And the man reached out and grabbed it.
122Kg 6:8 When the king of Aram was at war with Israel, he would confer with his officers and say, "We will mobilize our forces at such and such a place."
122Kg 6:9 But immediately Elisha, the man of God, would warn the king of Israel, "Do not go near that place, for the Arameans are planning to mobilize their troops there."
122Kg 6:10 So the king of Israel would send word to the place indicated by the man of God. Time and again Elisha warned the king, so that he would be on the alert there.
122Kg 6:11 The king of Aram became very upset over this. He called his officers together and demanded, "Which of you is the traitor? Who has been informing the king of Israel of my plans?"
122Kg 6:12 "It's not us, my lord the king," one of the officers replied. "Elisha, the prophet in Israel, tells the king of Israel even the words you speak in the privacy of your bedroom!"
122Kg 6:13 "Go and find out where he is," the king commanded, "so I can send troops to seize him." And the report came back�� "Elisha is at Dothan."
122Kg 6:14 So one night the king of Aram sent a great army with many chariots and horses to surround the city.
122Kg 6:15 When the servant of the man of God got up early the next morning and went outside, there were troops, horses, and chariots everywhere. "Oh, sir, what will we do now?" the young man cried to Elisha.
122Kg 6:16 "Don't be afraid!" Elisha told him. "For there are more on our side than on theirs!"
122Kg 6:17 Then Elisha prayed, "O LORD, open his eyes and let him see!" The LORD opened the young man's eyes, and when he looked up, he saw that the hillside around Elisha was filled with horses and chariots of fire.
122Kg 6:18 As the Aramean army advanced toward him, Elisha prayed, "O LORD, please make them blind." So the LORD struck them with blindness as Elisha had asked.
122Kg 6:19 Then Elisha went out and told them, "You have come the wrong way! This isn't the right city! Follow me, and I will take you to the man you are looking for." And he led them to the city of Samaria.
122Kg 6:20 As soon as they had entered Samaria, Elisha prayed, "O LORD, now open their eyes and let them see." So the LORD opened their eyes, and they discovered that they were in the middle of Samaria.
122Kg 6:21 When the king of Israel saw them, he shouted to Elisha, "My father, should I kill them? Should I kill them?"
122Kg 6:22 "Of course not!" Elisha replied. "Do we kill prisoners of war? Give them food and drink and send them home again to their master."
122Kg 6:23 So the king made a great feast for them and then sent them home to their master. After that, the Aramean raiders stayed away from the land of Israel.
122Kg 6:24 Some time later, however, King Ben-hadad of Aram mustered his entire army and besieged Samaria.
122Kg 6:25 As a result, there was a great famine in the city. The siege lasted so long that a donkey's head sold for eighty pieces of silver, and a cup of dove's dung sold for five pieces�� of silver. / ��Hebrew sold for 80 shekels [2 pounds, or 0.9 kilograms] of silver, and 1/4 of a cab [0.3 liters] of dove's dung sold for 5 shekels [2 ounces, or 57 grams]. Dove's dung may be a variety of wild vegetable
122Kg 6:26 One day as the king of Israel was walking along the wall of the city, a woman called to him, "Please help me, my lord the king!"
122Kg 6:27 He answered, "If the LORD doesn't help you, what can I do? I have neither food from the threshing floor nor wine from the press to give you."
122Kg 6:28 But then the king asked, "What is the matter?" She replied, "This woman said to me�� 'Come on, let's eat your son today, then we will eat my son tomorrow.'
122Kg 6:29 So we cooked my son and ate him. Then the next day I said to her, 'Kill your son so we can eat him,' but she has hidden her son."
122Kg 6:30 When the king heard this, he tore his clothes in despair. And as the king walked along the wall, the people could see that he was wearing burlap under his robe next to his skin.
122Kg 6:31 "May God strike me and even kill me if I don't separate Elisha's head from his shoulders this very day," the king vowed.
122Kg 6:32 Elisha was sitting in his house with the elders of Israel when the king sent a messenger to summon him. But before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "A murderer has sent a man to cut off my head. When he arrives, shut the door and keep him out. We will soon hear his master's steps following him."
122Kg 6:33 While Elisha was still saying this, the messenger arrived. And the king�� said, "All this misery is from the LORD! Why should I wait for the LORD any longer?" / ��Hebrew he
122Kg 7:1 Elisha replied, "Listen to this message from the LORD! This is what the LORD says�� By this time tomorrow in the markets of Samaria, five quarts of choice flour will cost only one piece of silver��, and ten quarts of barley grain will cost only one piece of silver��." / ��Hebrew 1 seah [6 liters] of choice flour will cost 1 shekel [0.4 ounces, or 11 grams]; also in 7.16, 18 ��Hebrew 2 seahs [12 liters] of barley grain will cost 1 shekel [0.4 ounces, or 11 grams]; also in 7.16, 18
122Kg 7:2 The officer assisting the king said to the man of God, "That couldn't happen even if the LORD opened the windows of heaven!" But Elisha replied, "You will see it happen with your own eyes, but you won't be able to eat any of it!"
122Kg 7:3 Now there were four men with leprosy�� sitting at the entrance of the city gates. "Why should we sit here waiting to die?" they asked each other. / ��Or with a contagious skin disease. The Hebrew word used here and throughout this passage can describe various skin diseases
122Kg 7:4 "We will starve if we stay here, but with the famine in the city, we will starve if we go back there. So we might as well go out and surrender to the Aramean army. If they let us live, so much the better. But if they kill us, we would have died anyway."
122Kg 7:5 So at twilight they set out for the camp of the Arameans. But when they came to the edge of the camp, no one was there!
122Kg 7:6 For the Lord had caused the Aramean army to hear the clatter of speeding chariots and the galloping of horses and the sounds of a great army approaching. "The king of Israel has hired the Hittites and Egyptians�� to attack us!" they cried to one another. / ��Possibly and the people of Muzur, a district near Cilicia
122Kg 7:7 So they panicked and ran into the night, abandoning their tents, horses, donkeys, and everything else, as they fled for their lives.
122Kg 7:8 When the lepers arrived at the edge of the camp, they went into one tent after another, eating and drinking wine; and they carried off silver and gold and clothing and hid it.
122Kg 7:9 Finally, they said to each other, "This is not right. This is a day of good news, and we aren't sharing it with anyone! If we wait until morning, some calamity will certainly fall upon us. Come on, let's go back and tell the people at the palace."
122Kg 7:10 So they went back to the city and told the gatekeepers what had happened. "We went out to the Aramean camp," they said, "and no one was there! The horses and donkeys were tethered and the tents were all in order, but there wasn't a single person around!"
122Kg 7:11 Then the gatekeepers shouted the news to the people in the palace.
122Kg 7:12 The king got out of bed in the middle of the night and told his officers, "I know what has happened. The Arameans know we are starving, so they have left their camp and have hidden in the fields. They are expecting us to leave the city, and then they will take us alive and capture the city."
122Kg 7:13 One of his officers replied, "We had better send out scouts to check into this. Let them take five of the remaining horses. If something happens to them, it will be no worse than if they stay here and die with the rest of us."
122Kg 7:14 So two chariots with horses were prepared, and the king sent scouts to see what had happened to the Aramean army.
122Kg 7:15 They went all the way to the Jordan River, following a trail of clothing and equipment that the Arameans had thrown away in their mad rush to escape. The scouts returned and told the king about it.
122Kg 7:16 Then the people of Samaria rushed out and plundered the Aramean camp. So it was true that five quarts of choice flour were sold that day for one piece of silver, and ten quarts of barley grain were sold for one piece of silver, just as the LORD had promised.
122Kg 7:17 The king appointed his officer to control the traffic at the gate, but he was knocked down and trampled to death as the people rushed out. So everything happened exactly as the man of God had predicted when the king came to his house.
122Kg 7:18 The man of God had said to the king, "By this time tomorrow in the markets of Samaria, five quarts of choice flour will cost one piece of silver, and ten quarts of barley grain will cost one piece of silver."
122Kg 7:19 The king's officer had replied, "That couldn't happen even if the LORD opened the windows of heaven!" And the man of God had said, "You will see it happen with your own eyes, but you won't be able to eat any of it!"
122Kg 7:20 And so it was, for the people trampled him to death at the gate!
122Kg 8:1 Elisha had told the woman whose son he had brought back to life, "Take your family and move to some other place, for the LORD has called for a famine on Israel that will last for seven years."
122Kg 8:2 So the woman did as the man of God instructed. She took her family and settled in the land of the Philistines for seven years.
122Kg 8:3 After the famine ended she returned from the land of the Philistines, and she went to see the king about getting back her house and land.
122Kg 8:4 As she came in, the king was talking with Gehazi, the servant of the man of God. The king had just said, "Tell me some stories about the great things Elisha has done."
122Kg 8:5 And Gehazi was telling the king about the time Elisha had brought a boy back to life. At that very moment, the mother of the boy walked in to make her appeal to the king about her house and land."Look, my lord the king!" Gehazi exclaimed. "Here is the woman now, and this is her son - the very one Elisha brought back to life!"
122Kg 8:6 "Is this true?" the king asked her. And she told him the story. So he directed one of his officials to see that everything she had lost was restored to her, including the value of any crops that had been harvested during her absence.
122Kg 8:7 Elisha went to Damascus, the capital of Aram, where King Ben-hadad lay sick. When someone told the king that the man of God had come,
122Kg 8:8 the king said to Hazael, "Take a gift to the man of God. Then tell him to ask the LORD, 'Will I recover from this illness?'"
122Kg 8:9 So Hazael loaded down forty camels with the finest products of Damascus as a gift for Elisha. He went to him and said, "Your servant Ben-hadad, the king of Aram, has sent me to ask, 'Will I recover from this illness?'"
122Kg 8:10 And Elisha replied, "Go and tell him, 'You will surely recover.' But actually the LORD has shown me that he will surely die!"
122Kg 8:11 Elisha stared at Hazael�� with a fixed gaze until Hazael became uneasy��. Then the man of God started weeping. / ��Hebrew He stared at him ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
122Kg 8:12 "What's the matter, my lord?" Hazael asked him.Elisha replied, "I know the terrible things you will do to the people of Israel. You will burn their fortified cities, kill their young men with the sword, dash their little children to the ground, and rip open their pregnant women!"
122Kg 8:13 Hazael responded, "How could a nobody like me�� ever accomplish such great things?" Elisha answered, "The LORD has shown me that you are going to be the king of Aram." / ��Hebrew a dog
122Kg 8:14 When Hazael left Elisha and went back, the king asked him, "What did Elisha tell you?" And Hazael replied, "He told me that you will surely recover."
122Kg 8:15 But the next day Hazael took a blanket, soaked it in water, and held it over the king's face until he died. Then Hazael became the next king of Aram.
122Kg 8:16 Jehoram son of King Jehoshaphat of Judah began to rule over Judah in the fifth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab, king of Israel.
122Kg 8:17 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
122Kg 8:18 But Jehoram followed the example of the kings of Israel and was as wicked as King Ahab, for he had married one of Ahab's daughters. So Jehoram did what was evil in the LORD's sight.
122Kg 8:19 But the LORD did not want to destroy Judah, for he had made a covenant with David and promised that his descendants would continue to rule, shining like a lamp forever.
122Kg 8:20 During Jehoram's reign, the Edomites revolted against Judah and crowned their own king.
122Kg 8:21 So Jehoram�� went with all his chariots to attack the town of Zair��. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he went out at night and attacked them�� under cover of darkness. But Jehoram's army deserted him and fled to their homes. / ��Hebrew Joram, a variant spelling of Jehoram; also in 8.23, 24 ��Or he went out and escaped. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain ��Greek version reads Seir
122Kg 8:22 So Edom has been independent from Judah to this day. The town of Libnah also revolted about that same time.
122Kg 8:23 The rest of the events in Jehoram's reign and everything he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 8:24 When Jehoram died, he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Ahaziah became the next king.
122Kg 8:25 Ahaziah son of Jehoram began to rule over Judah in the twelfth year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab, king of Israel.
122Kg 8:26 Ahaziah was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri of Israel.
122Kg 8:27 Ahaziah followed the evil example of King Ahab's family. He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, just as Ahab's family had done, for he was related by marriage to the family of Ahab.
122Kg 8:28 Ahaziah joined Joram son of Ahab, the king of Israel, in his war against King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. When the Arameans wounded King Joram in the battle,
122Kg 8:29 he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had received at Ramoth��. Because Joram was wounded, King Ahaziah of Judah went to Jezreel to visit him. / ��Hebrew Ramah, a variant spelling of Ramoth
122Kg 9:1 Meanwhile, Elisha the prophet had summoned a member of the group of prophets. "Get ready to travel,"�� he told him, "and take this flask of olive oil with you. Go to Ramoth-gilead, / ��Hebrew Bind up your loins
122Kg 9:2 and find Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi. Call him into a private room away from his friends,
122Kg 9:3 and pour the oil over his head. Say to him, 'This is what the LORD says�� I anoint you to be the king over Israel.' Then open the door and run for your life!"
122Kg 9:4 So the young prophet did as he was told and went to Ramoth-gilead.
122Kg 9:5 When he arrived there, he found Jehu sitting around with the other army officers. "I have a message for you, Commander," he said."For which one of us?" Jehu asked."For you, Commander," he replied.
122Kg 9:6 So Jehu left the others and went into the house. Then the young prophet poured the oil over Jehu's head and said, "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says�� I anoint you king over the LORD's people, Israel.
122Kg 9:7 You are to destroy the family of Ahab, your master. In this way, I will avenge the murder of my prophets and all the LORD's servants who were killed by Jezebel.
122Kg 9:8 The entire family of Ahab must be wiped out. I will destroy every one of his male descendants, slave and free alike, anywhere in Israel.
122Kg 9:9 I will destroy the family of Ahab as I destroyed the families of Jeroboam son of Nebat and of Baasha son of Ahijah.
122Kg 9:10 Dogs will eat Ahab's wife Jezebel at the plot of land in Jezreel, and no one will bury her." Then the young prophet opened the door and ran.
122Kg 9:11 Jehu went back to his fellow officers, and one of them asked him, "What did that madman want? Is everything all right?" "You know how a man like that babbles on," Jehu replied.
122Kg 9:12 "You're hiding something," they said. "Tell us." So Jehu told them, "He said to me, 'This is what the LORD says�� I have anointed you to be king over Israel.'"
122Kg 9:13 Then they quickly spread out their cloaks on the bare steps and blew the ram's horn, shouting, "Jehu is king!"
122Kg 9:14 So Jehu son of Jehoshaphat, son of Nimshi, led a conspiracy against King Joram. (Now Joram had been with the army at Ramoth-gilead, defending Israel against the forces of King Hazael of Aram.
122Kg 9:15 But King Joram�� was wounded in the fighting and returned to Jezreel to recover from his wounds.) So Jehu told the men with him, "If you want me to be king, don't let anyone leave town and go to Jezreel to report what we have done." / ��Hebrew Jehoram, a variant spelling of Joram; also in 9.17, 21, 22, 23, 24
122Kg 9:16 Then Jehu got into a chariot and rode to Jezreel to find King Joram, who was lying there wounded. King Ahaziah of Judah was there, too, for he had gone to visit him.
122Kg 9:17 The watchman on the tower of Jezreel saw Jehu and his company approaching, so he shouted to Joram, "I see a company of troops coming!" "Send out a rider to ask if they are coming in peace," King Joram ordered.
122Kg 9:18 So a horseman went out to meet Jehu and said, "The king wants to know if you are coming in peace." Jehu replied, "What do you know about peace? Fall in behind me!" The watchman called out to the king, "The messenger has met them, but he's not returning."
122Kg 9:19 So the king sent out a second horseman. He rode up to them and said, "The king wants to know if you come in peace." Again Jehu answered, "What do you know about peace? Fall in behind me!"
122Kg 9:20 The watchman exclaimed, "The messenger has met them, but he isn't returning either! It must be Jehu son of Nimshi, for he's driving like a madman."
122Kg 9:21 "Quick! Get my chariot ready!" King Joram commanded.Then King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah rode out in their chariots to meet Jehu. They met him at the plot of land that had belonged to Naboth of Jezreel.
122Kg 9:22 King Joram demanded, "Do you come in peace, Jehu?" Jehu replied, "How can there be peace as long as the idolatry and witchcraft of your mother, Jezebel, are all around us?"
122Kg 9:23 Then King Joram turned the horses around�� and fled, shouting to King Ahaziah, "Treason, Ahaziah!" / ��Hebrew turned his hands
122Kg 9:24 But Jehu drew his bow and shot Joram between the shoulders. The arrow pierced his heart, and he sank down dead in his chariot.
122Kg 9:25 Jehu said to Bidkar, his officer, "Throw him into the plot of land that belonged to Naboth of Jezreel. Do you remember when you and I were riding along behind his father, Ahab? The LORD pronounced this message against him.
122Kg 9:26 'I solemnly swear that I will repay him here on this plot of land, says the LORD, for the murder of Naboth and his sons that I saw yesterday.' So throw him out on Naboth's property, just as the LORD said."
122Kg 9:27 When King Ahaziah of Judah saw what was happening, he fled along the road to Beth-haggan. Jehu rode after him, shouting, "Shoot him, too!" So they shot Ahaziah in his chariot at the Ascent of Gur, near Ibleam. He was able to go on as far as Megiddo, but he died there.
122Kg 9:28 His servants took him by chariot to Jerusalem, where they buried him with his ancestors in the City of David.
122Kg 9:29 Ahaziah had become king over Judah in the eleventh year of the reign of Joram son of Ahab.
122Kg 9:30 When Jezebel, the queen mother, heard that Jehu had come to Jezreel, she painted her eyelids and fixed her hair and sat at a window.
122Kg 9:31 When Jehu entered the gate of the palace, she shouted at him, "Have you come in peace, you murderer? You're just like Zimri, who murdered his master!"�� / ��See 1 Kgs 16.9-10, where Zimri killed his master, King Elah
122Kg 9:32 Jehu looked up and saw her at the window and shouted, "Who is on my side?" And two or three eunuchs looked out at him.
122Kg 9:33 "Throw her down!" Jehu yelled. So they threw her out the window, and her blood spattered against the wall and on the horses. And Jehu trampled her body under his horses' hooves.
122Kg 9:34 Then Jehu went into the palace and ate and drank. Afterward he said, "Someone go and bury this cursed woman, for she is the daughter of a king."
122Kg 9:35 But when they went out to bury her, they found only her skull, her feet, and her hands.
122Kg 9:36 When they returned and told Jehu, he stated, "This fulfills the message from the LORD, which he spoke through his servant Elijah from Tishbe�� 'At the plot of land in Jezreel, dogs will eat Jezebel's body.
122Kg 9:37 Her remains will be scattered like dung on the plot of land in Jezreel, so that no one will be able to recognize her.'"
122Kg 10:1 Ahab had seventy sons living in the city of Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria, to the elders and officials of the city��, and to the guardians of King Ahab's sons. He said, / ��As in some Greek manuscripts and Latin Vulgate (see also 10.6); Hebrew reads of Jezreel
122Kg 10:2 "The king's sons are with you, and you have at your disposal chariots, horses, a fortified city, and weapons. As soon as you receive this letter,
122Kg 10:3 select the best qualified of your master's sons to be your king, and prepare to fight for Ahab's dynasty."
122Kg 10:4 But they were paralyzed with fear and said, "We've seen that two kings couldn't stand against this man! What can we do?"
122Kg 10:5 So the palace and city administrators, together with the elders and the guardians of the king's sons, sent this message to Jehu�� "We are your servants and will do anything you tell us. We will not make anyone king; do whatever you think is best."
122Kg 10:6 Jehu responded with a second letter�� "If you are on my side and are going to obey me, bring the heads of your master's sons to me at Jezreel by this time tomorrow." Now the seventy sons of the king were being cared for by the leaders of Samaria, where they had been raised since childhood.
122Kg 10:7 When the letter arrived, the leaders killed all seventy of the king's sons. They placed their heads in baskets and presented them to Jehu at Jezreel.
122Kg 10:8 A messenger went to Jehu and said, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons." So Jehu ordered, "Pile them in two heaps at the entrance of the city gate, and leave them there until morning."
122Kg 10:9 In the morning he went out and spoke to the crowd that had gathered around them. "You are not to blame," he told them. "I am the one who conspired against my master and killed him. But who killed all these?
122Kg 10:10 You can be sure that the message of the LORD that was spoken concerning Ahab's family will not fail. The LORD declared through his servant Elijah that this would happen."
122Kg 10:11 Then Jehu killed all who were left of Ahab's relatives living in Jezreel and all his important officials, his personal friends, and his priests. So Ahab was left without a single survivor.
122Kg 10:12 Then Jehu set out for Samaria. Along the way, while he was at Beth-eked of the Shepherds,
122Kg 10:13 he met some relatives of King Ahaziah of Judah. "Who are you?" he asked them. And they replied, "We are relatives of King Ahaziah. We are going to visit the sons of King Ahab and the sons of the queen mother."
122Kg 10:14 "Take them alive!" Jehu shouted to his men. And they captured all forty-two of them and killed them at the well of Beth-eked. None of them escaped.
122Kg 10:15 When Jehu left there, he met Jehonadab son of Recab, who was coming to meet him. After they had greeted each other, Jehu said to him, "Are you as loyal to me as I am to you?" "Yes, I am," Jehonadab replied. "If you are," Jehu said, "then give me your hand." So Jehonadab put out his hand, and Jehu helped him into the chariot.
122Kg 10:16 Then Jehu said, "Now come with me, and see how devoted I am to the LORD." So Jehonadab rode along with him.
122Kg 10:17 When Jehu arrived in Samaria, he killed everyone who was left there from Ahab's family, just as the LORD had promised through Elijah.
122Kg 10:18 Then Jehu called a meeting of all the people of the city and said to them, "Ahab's worship of Baal was nothing compared to the way I will worship him!
122Kg 10:19 Therefore, summon all the prophets and worshipers of Baal, and call together all his priests. See to it that every one of them comes, for I am going to offer a great sacrifice to Baal. Anyone who fails to come will be put to death." But Jehu's cunning plan was to destroy all the worshipers of Baal.
122Kg 10:20 Then Jehu ordered, "Prepare a solemn assembly to worship Baal!" So they did.
122Kg 10:21 He sent messengers throughout all Israel summoning those who worshiped Baal. They all came - not a single one remained behind - and they filled the temple of Baal from one end to the other.
122Kg 10:22 And Jehu instructed the keeper of the wardrobe, "Be sure that every worshiper of Baal wears one of these robes." So robes were given to them.
122Kg 10:23 Then Jehu went into the temple of Baal with Jehonadab son of Recab. Jehu said to the worshipers of Baal, "Make sure no one who worships the LORD is here - only those who worship Baal."
122Kg 10:24 So they were all inside the temple to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Now Jehu had stationed eighty of his men outside the building and had warned them, "If you let anyone escape, you will pay for it with your own life."
122Kg 10:25 As soon as Jehu had finished sacrificing the burnt offering, he commanded his guards and officers, "Go in and kill all of them. Don't let a single one escape!" So they killed them all with their swords, and the guards and officers dragged their bodies outside��. Then Jehu's men went into the innermost fortress�� of the temple of Baal. / ��Or they left their bodies lying there; or they threw them out into the outermost court ��Hebrew city
122Kg 10:26 They dragged out the sacred pillar�� used in the worship of Baal and burned it. / ��As in Greek and Syriac versions and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew reads sacred pillars
122Kg 10:27 They smashed the sacred pillar and wrecked the temple of Baal, converting it into a public toilet, as it remains to this day.
122Kg 10:28 In this way, Jehu destroyed every trace of Baal worship from Israel.
122Kg 10:29 He did not, however, destroy the gold calves at Bethel and Dan, with which Jeroboam son of Nebat had caused Israel to sin.
122Kg 10:30 Nonetheless the LORD said to Jehu, "You have done well in following my instructions to destroy the family of Ahab. Therefore, your descendants will be kings of Israel down to the fourth generation."
122Kg 10:31 But Jehu did not obey the Law of the LORD, the God of Israel, with all his heart. He refused to turn from the sins that Jeroboam had led Israel to commit.
122Kg 10:32 At about that time the LORD began to cut down the size of Israel's territory. King Hazael conquered several sections of the country
122Kg 10:33 east of the Jordan River, including all of Gilead, Gad, Reuben, and Manasseh. He conquered the area from the town of Aroer by the Arnon Gorge to as far north as Gilead and Bashan.
122Kg 10:34 The rest of the events in Jehu's reign - everything he did and all his achievements - are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 10:35 When Jehu died, he was buried in Samaria. Then his son Jehoahaz became the next king.
122Kg 10:36 In all, Jehu reigned over Israel from Samaria for twenty-eight years.
122Kg 11:1 When Athaliah, the mother of King Ahaziah of Judah, learned that her son was dead, she began to destroy the rest of the royal family.
122Kg 11:2 But Ahaziah's sister Jehosheba, the daughter of King Jehoram��, took Ahaziah's infant son, Joash, and stole him away from among the rest of the king's children, who were about to be killed. She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom to hide him from Athaliah, so the child was not murdered. / ��Hebrew Joram, a variant spelling of Jehoram
122Kg 11:3 Joash remained hidden in the Temple of the LORD for six years while Athaliah ruled over the land.
122Kg 11:4 In the seventh year of Athaliah's reign, Jehoiada the priest summoned the commanders, the Carite mercenaries, and the palace guards to come to the Temple of the LORD. He made a solemn pact with them and made them swear an oath of loyalty there in the LORD's Temple; then he showed them the king's son.
122Kg 11:5 Jehoiada told them, "This is what you must do. A third of you who are on duty on the Sabbath are to guard the royal palace itself.
122Kg 11:6 Another third of you are to stand guard at the Sur Gate. And the final third must stand guard behind the palace guard. These three groups will all guard the palace.
122Kg 11:7 The other two units who are off duty on the Sabbath must stand guard for the king at the LORD's Temple.
122Kg 11:8 Form a bodyguard around the king and keep your weapons in hand. Kill anyone who tries to break through. Stay with the king wherever he goes."
122Kg 11:9 So the commanders did everything as Jehoiada the priest ordered. The commanders took charge of the men reporting for duty that Sabbath, as well as those who were going off duty. They brought them all to Jehoiada the priest,
122Kg 11:10 and he supplied them with the spears and small shields that had once belonged to King David and were stored in the Temple of the LORD.
122Kg 11:11 The palace guards stationed themselves around the king, with their weapons ready. They formed a line from the south side of the Temple around to the north side and all around the altar.
122Kg 11:12 Then Jehoiada brought out Joash, the king's son, placed the crown on his head, and presented him with a copy of God's laws��. They anointed him and proclaimed him king, and everyone clapped their hands and shouted, "Long live the king!" / ��Or a copy of the covenant
122Kg 11:13 When Athaliah heard all the noise made by the palace guards and the people, she hurried to the LORD's Temple to see what was happening.
122Kg 11:14 When she arrived, she saw the newly crowned king standing in his place of authority by the pillar, as was the custom at times of coronation. The commanders and trumpeters were surrounding him, and people from all over the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. When Athaliah saw all this, she tore her clothes in despair and shouted, "Treason! Treason!"
122Kg 11:15 Then Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders who were in charge of the troops, "Take her to the soldiers in front of the Temple��, and kill anyone who tries to rescue her." For the priest had said, "She must not be killed in the Temple of the LORD." / ��Or Bring her out from between the ranks; or Take her out of the Temple precincts. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
122Kg 11:16 So they seized her and led her out to the gate where horses enter the palace grounds, and she was killed there.
122Kg 11:17 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between the LORD and the king and the people that they would be the LORD's people. He also made a covenant between the king and the people.
122Kg 11:18 And all the people of the land went over to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They demolished the altars and smashed the idols to pieces, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.Jehoiada the priest stationed guards at the Temple of the LORD.
122Kg 11:19 Then the commanders, the Carite mercenaries, the palace guards, and all the people of the land escorted the king from the Temple of the LORD. They went through the gate of the guards and into the palace, and the king took his seat on the royal throne.
122Kg 11:20 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was peaceful because Athaliah had been killed at the king's palace.
122Kg 11:21 ��Joash�� was seven years old when he became king. / ��Verse 11.21 is numbered 12.1 in Hebrew text ��Hebrew Jehoash, a variant spelling of Joash
122Kg 12:1 ��Joash�� began to rule over Judah in the seventh year of King Jehu's reign in Israel. He reigned in Jerusalem forty years.

122Kg 12:2 All his life Joash did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight because Jehoiada the priest instructed him.
122Kg 12:3 Yet even so, he did not destroy the pagan shrines, and the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there.
122Kg 12:4 One day King Joash said to the priests, "Collect all the money brought as a sacred offering to the LORD's Temple, whether it is a regular assessment, a payment of vows, or a voluntary gift.
122Kg 12:5 Let the priests take some of that money to pay for whatever repairs are needed at the Temple."
122Kg 12:6 But by the twenty-third year of Joash's reign, the priests still had not repaired the Temple.
122Kg 12:7 So King Joash called for Jehoiada and the other priests and asked them, "Why haven't you repaired the Temple? Don't use any more money for your own needs. From now on, it must all be spent on Temple repairs."
122Kg 12:8 So the priests agreed not to accept any more money from the people, and they also agreed to let others take responsibility for repairing the Temple.
122Kg 12:9 Then Jehoiada the priest bored a hole in the lid of a large chest and set it on the right-hand side of the altar at the entrance of the Temple of the LORD. The priests guarding the entrance put all of the people's contributions into the chest.
122Kg 12:10 Whenever the chest became full, the court secretary and the high priest counted the money that had been brought to the LORD's Temple and put it into bags.
122Kg 12:11 Then they gave the money to the construction supervisors, who used it to pay the people working on the LORD's Temple - the carpenters, the builders,
122Kg 12:12 the masons, and the stonecutters. They also used the money to buy the timber and the finished stone needed for repairing the LORD's Temple, and they paid any other expenses related to the Temple's restoration.
122Kg 12:13 The money brought to the Temple was not used for making silver bowls, lamp snuffers, basins, trumpets, or other articles of gold or silver for the Temple of the LORD.
122Kg 12:14 It was paid to the workmen, who used it for the Temple repairs.
122Kg 12:15 No accounting of this money was required from the construction supervisors, because they were honest and trustworthy men.
122Kg 12:16 However, the money that was contributed for guilt offerings and sin offerings was not brought into the LORD's Temple. It was given to the priests for their own use.
122Kg 12:17 About this time King Hazael of Aram went to war against Gath and captured it. Then he turned to attack Jerusalem.
122Kg 12:18 King Joash collected all the sacred objects that Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, the previous kings of Judah, had dedicated, along with what he himself had dedicated. He sent them all to Hazael, along with all the gold in the treasuries of the LORD's Temple and the royal palace. So Hazael called off his attack on Jerusalem.
122Kg 12:19 The rest of the events in Joash's reign and everything he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 12:20 Joash's officers plotted against him and assassinated him at Beth-millo on the road to Silla.
122Kg 12:21 The assassins were Jozacar�� son of Shimeath and Jehozabad son of Shomer - both trusted advisers. Joash was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Amaziah became the next king. / ��As in Greek and Syriac versions; Hebrew reads Jozabad
122Kg 13:1 Jehoahaz son of Jehu began to rule over Israel in the twenty-third year of King Joash's reign in Judah. He reigned in Samaria seventeen years.
122Kg 13:2 But he did what was evil in the LORD's sight. He followed the example of Jeroboam son of Nebat, continuing the sins that Jeroboam had led Israel to commit.
122Kg 13:3 So the LORD was very angry with Israel, and he allowed King Hazael of Aram and his son Ben-hadad to defeat them repeatedly.
122Kg 13:4 Then Jehoahaz prayed for the LORD's help, and the LORD heard his prayer, for he could see how severely the king of Aram was oppressing Israel.
122Kg 13:5 So the LORD provided someone to rescue the Israelites from the tyranny of the Arameans. Then Israel lived in safety again as they had in former days.
122Kg 13:6 But they continued to sin, following the evil example of Jeroboam. They also allowed the Asherah pole in Samaria to remain standing.
122Kg 13:7 Finally, Jehoahaz's army was reduced to 50 charioteers, 10 chariots, and 10,000 foot soldiers. The king of Aram had killed the others, trampling them like dust under his feet.

122Kg 13:14 When Elisha was in his last illness, King Jehoash of Israel visited him and wept over him. "My father! My father! I see the chariots and charioteers of Israel!" he cried.
122Kg 13:15 Elisha told him, "Get a bow and some arrows." And the king did as he was told.
122Kg 13:16 Elisha told him, "Put your hand on the bow," and Elisha laid his own hands on the king's hands.
122Kg 13:17 Then he commanded, "Open that eastern window," and he opened it. Then he said, "Shoot!" So he shot an arrow. Elisha proclaimed, "This is the LORD's arrow, an arrow of victory over Aram, for you will completely conquer the Arameans at Aphek."
122Kg 13:18 Then he said, "Now pick up the other arrows and strike them against the ground." So the king picked them up and struck the ground three times.
122Kg 13:19 But the man of God was angry with him. "You should have struck the ground five or six times!" he exclaimed. "Then you would have beaten Aram until it was entirely destroyed. Now you will be victorious only three times."
122Kg 13:20 Then Elisha died and was buried. Groups of Moabite raiders used to invade the land each spring.
122Kg 13:21 Once when some Israelites were burying a man, they spied a band of these raiders. So they hastily threw the corpse into the tomb of Elisha and fled. But as soon as the body touched Elisha's bones, the dead man revived and jumped to his feet!
122Kg 13:22 King Hazael of Aram had oppressed Israel during the entire reign of King Jehoahaz.
122Kg 13:23 But the LORD was gracious and merciful to the people of Israel, and they were not totally destroyed. He pitied them because of his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And to this day he still has not completely destroyed them or banished them from his presence.
122Kg 13:24 King Hazael of Aram died, and his son Ben-hadad became the next king.
122Kg 13:25 Then Jehoash son of Jehoahaz recaptured from Ben-hadad son of Hazael the towns that had been taken from Jehoash's father, Jehoahaz. Jehoash defeated Ben-hadad on three occasions, and he recovered the Israelite towns.

122Kg 14:4 Amaziah did not destroy the pagan shrines, and the people still offered sacrifices and burned incense there.
122Kg 14:5 When Amaziah was well established as king, he executed the officials who had assassinated his father.
122Kg 14:6 However, he did not kill the children of the assassins, for he obeyed the command of the LORD as written by Moses in the Book of the Law�� "Parents must not be put to death for the sins of their children, nor children for the sins of their parents. Those deserving to die must be put to death for their own crimes."�� / ��Deut 24.16
122Kg 14:7 Amaziah also killed 10,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt. He also conquered Sela and changed its name to Joktheel, as it is called to this day.
122Kg 14:8 One day Amaziah sent messengers with this challenge to Israel's king Jehoash, the son of Jehoahaz and grandson of Jehu�� "Come and meet me in battle!"�� / ��Hebrew Come, let us look one another in the face
122Kg 14:9 But King Jehoash of Israel replied to King Amaziah of Judah with this story�� "Out in the Lebanon mountains, a thistle sent a message to a mighty cedar tree�� 'Give your daughter in marriage to my son.'

122Kg 14:11 But Amaziah refused to listen, so King Jehoash of Israel mobilized his army against King Amaziah of Judah. The two armies drew up their battle lines at Beth-shemesh in Judah.
122Kg 14:12 Judah was routed by the army of Israel, and its army scattered and fled for home.
122Kg 14:13 King Jehoash of Israel captured Judah's king, Amaziah son of Joash and grandson of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh. Then he marched to Jerusalem, where he demolished 600 feet�� of Jerusalem's wall, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. / ��Hebrew 400 cubits [180 meters]

122Kg 17:7 This disaster came upon the people of Israel because they worshiped other gods. They sinned against the LORD their God, who had brought them safely out of Egypt and had rescued them from the power of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt.
122Kg 17:8 They had followed the practices of the pagan nations the LORD had driven from the land ahead of them, as well as the practices the kings of Israel had introduced.
122Kg 17:9 The people of Israel had also secretly done many things that were not pleasing to the LORD their God. They built pagan shrines for themselves in all their towns, from the smallest outpost to the largest walled city.
122Kg 17:10 They set up sacred pillars and Asherah poles at the top of every hill and under every green tree.
122Kg 17:11 They offered sacrifices on all the hilltops, just like the nations the LORD had driven from the land ahead of them. So the people of Israel had done many evil things, arousing the LORD's anger.
122Kg 17:12 Yes, they worshiped idols��, despite the LORD's specific and repeated warnings. / ��The Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung
122Kg 17:13 Again and again the LORD had sent his prophets and seers to warn both Israel and Judah�� "Turn from all your evil ways. Obey my commands and decrees - the entire law that I commanded your ancestors to obey, and that I gave you through my servants the prophets."
122Kg 17:14 But the Israelites would not listen. They were as stubborn as their ancestors who had refused to believe in the LORD their God.
122Kg 17:15 They rejected his decrees and the covenant he had made with their ancestors, and they despised all his warnings. They worshiped worthless idols, so they became worthless themselves. They followed the example of the nations around them, disobeying the LORD's command not to imitate them.
122Kg 17:16 They rejected all the commands of the LORD their God and made two calves from metal. They set up an Asherah pole and worshiped Baal and all the forces of heaven.
122Kg 17:17 They even sacrificed their own sons and daughters in the fire��. They consulted fortune-tellers and practiced sorcery and sold themselves to evil, arousing the LORD's anger. / ��Or They even made their sons and daughters pass through the fire
122Kg 17:18 Because the LORD was very angry with Israel, he swept them away from his presence. Only the tribe of Judah remained in the land.
122Kg 17:19 But even the people of Judah refused to obey the commands of the LORD their God, for they followed the evil practices that Israel had introduced.
122Kg 17:20 The LORD rejected all the descendants of Israel. He punished them by handing them over to their attackers until he had banished Israel from his presence.
122Kg 17:21 For when the LORD�� tore Israel away from the kingdom of David, they chose Jeroboam son of Nebat as their king. But Jeroboam drew Israel away from following the LORD and made them commit a great sin. / ��Hebrew he; compare 1 Kgs 11.31-32
122Kg 17:22 And the people of Israel persisted in all the evil ways of Jeroboam. They did not turn from these sins
122Kg 17:23 until the LORD finally swept them away from his presence, just as all his prophets had warned. So Israel was exiled from their land to Assyria, where they remain to this day.
122Kg 17:24 The king of Assyria transported groups of people from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sepharvaim and resettled them in the towns of Samaria, replacing the people of Israel. They took possession of Samaria and lived in its towns.
122Kg 17:25 But since these foreign settlers did not worship the LORD when they first arrived, the LORD sent lions among them, which killed some of them.
122Kg 17:26 So a message was sent to the king of Assyria�� "The people you have sent to live in the towns of Samaria do not know the religious customs of the God of the land. He has sent lions among them to destroy them because they have not worshiped him correctly."
122Kg 17:27 The king of Assyria then commanded, "Send one of the exiled priests back to Samaria. Let him live there and teach the new residents the religious customs of the God of the land."
122Kg 17:28 So one of the priests who had been exiled from Samaria returned to Bethel and taught the new residents how to worship the LORD.
122Kg 17:29 But these various groups of foreigners also continued to worship their own gods. In town after town where they lived, they placed their idols at the pagan shrines that the people of Samaria had built.
122Kg 17:30 Those from Babylon worshiped idols of their god Succoth-benoth. Those from Cuthah worshiped their god Nergal. And those from Hamath worshiped Ashima.
122Kg 17:31 The Avvites worshiped their gods Nibhaz and Tartak. And the people from Sepharvaim even burned their own children as sacrifices to their gods Adrammelech and Anammelech.
122Kg 17:32 These new residents worshiped the LORD, but they also appointed from among themselves all sorts of people as priests to offer sacrifices at their places of worship.
122Kg 17:33 And though they worshiped the LORD, they continued to follow their own gods according to the religious customs of the nations from which they came.
122Kg 17:34 And this is still going on today. They continue to follow their former practices instead of truly worshiping the LORD and obeying the decrees, regulations, instructions, and commands he gave the descendants of Jacob, whose name he changed to Israel.
122Kg 17:35 For the LORD had made a covenant with the descendants of Jacob and commanded them�� "Do not worship any other gods or bow before them or serve them or offer sacrifices to them.
122Kg 17:36 But worship only the LORD, who brought you out of Egypt with great strength and a powerful arm. Bow down to him alone, and offer sacrifices only to him.
122Kg 17:37 Be careful at all times to obey the decrees, regulations, instructions, and commands that he wrote for you. You must not worship other gods.
122Kg 17:38 Do not forget the covenant I made with you, and do not worship other gods.
122Kg 17:39 You must worship only the LORD your God. He is the one who will rescue you from all your enemies."
122Kg 17:40 But the people would not listen and continued to follow their former practices.
122Kg 17:41 So while these new residents worshiped the LORD, they also worshiped their idols. And to this day their descendants do the same.
122Kg 18:1 Hezekiah son of Ahaz began to rule over Judah in the third year of King Hoshea's reign in Israel.
122Kg 18:2 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother was Abijah��, the daughter of Zechariah. / ��As in parallel text at 2 Chr 29.1; Hebrew reads Abi, a variant spelling of Abijah
122Kg 18:3 He did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight, just as his ancestor David had done.
122Kg 18:4 He removed the pagan shrines, smashed the sacred pillars, and cut down the Asherah poles. He broke up the bronze serpent that Moses had made, because the people of Israel had been offering sacrifices to it. The bronze serpent was called Nehushtan��. / ��Nehushtan sounds like the Hebrew terms that mean "snake," "bronze," and "unclean thing"
122Kg 18:5 Hezekiah trusted in the LORD, the God of Israel. There was no one like him among all the kings of Judah, either before or after his time.
122Kg 18:6 He remained faithful to the LORD in everything, and he carefully obeyed all the commands the LORD had given Moses.
122Kg 18:7 So the LORD was with him, and Hezekiah was successful in everything he did. He revolted against the king of Assyria and refused to pay him tribute.
122Kg 18:8 He also conquered the Philistines as far distant as Gaza and its territory, from their smallest outpost to their largest walled city.
122Kg 18:9 During the fourth year of Hezekiah's reign, which was the seventh year of King Hoshea's reign in Israel, King Shalmaneser of Assyria attacked the city of Samaria and began a siege against it.
122Kg 18:10 Three years later, during the sixth year of King Hezekiah's reign and the ninth year of King Hoshea's reign in Israel, Samaria fell.
122Kg 18:11 At that time the king of Assyria exiled the Israelites to Assyria and placed them in colonies in Halah, along the banks of the Habor River in Gozan, and in the cities of the Medes.
122Kg 18:12 For they refused to listen to the LORD their God and obey him. Instead, they violated his covenant - all the laws that Moses the LORD's servant had commanded them to obey.
122Kg 18:13 In the fourteenth year of King Hezekiah's reign��, King Sennacherib of Assyria came to attack the fortified towns of Judah and conquered them. / ��The fourteenth year of Hezekiah's reign was 701 B.C.
122Kg 18:14 King Hezekiah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish�� "I have done wrong. I will pay whatever tribute money you demand if you will only withdraw." The king of Assyria then demanded a settlement of more than eleven tons of silver and one ton of gold��. / ��Hebrew 300 talents [10 metric tons] of silver and 30 talents [1 metric ton] of gold
122Kg 18:15 To gather this amount, King Hezekiah used all the silver stored in the Temple of the LORD and in the palace treasury.
122Kg 18:16 Hezekiah even stripped the gold from the doors of the LORD's Temple and from the doorposts he had overlaid with gold, and he gave it all to the Assyrian king.
122Kg 18:17 Nevertheless, the king of Assyria sent his commander in chief, his field commander, and his chief of staff�� from Lachish with a huge army to confront King Hezekiah in Jerusalem. The Assyrians took up a position beside the aqueduct that feeds water into the upper pool, near the road leading to the field where cloth is washed��. / ��Or the rabshakeh; also in 18.19, 26, 27, 28, 37 ��Or bleached
122Kg 18:18 They summoned King Hezekiah, but the king sent these officials to meet with them�� Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, the royal historian.
122Kg 18:19 Then the Assyrian king's chief of staff told them to give this message to Hezekiah�� "This is what the great king of Assyria says�� What are you trusting in that makes you so confident?
122Kg 18:20 Do you think that mere words can substitute for military skill and strength? Who are you counting on, that you have rebelled against me?
122Kg 18:21 On Egypt? If you lean on Egypt, it will be like a reed that splinters beneath your weight and pierces your hand. Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, is completely unreliable!
122Kg 18:22 "But perhaps you will say to me, 'We are trusting in the LORD our God!' But isn't he the one who was insulted by Hezekiah? Didn't Hezekiah tear down his shrines and altars and make everyone in Judah and Jerusalem worship only at the altar here in Jerusalem?
122Kg 18:23 "I'll tell you what! Strike a bargain with my master, the king of Assyria. I will give you 2,000 horses if you can find that many men to ride on them!
122Kg 18:24 With your tiny army, how can you think of challenging even the weakest contingent of my master's troops, even with the help of Egypt's chariots and charioteers?
122Kg 18:25 What's more, do you think we have invaded your land without the LORD's direction? The LORD himself told us, 'Attack this land and destroy it!'"
122Kg 18:26 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, Shebna, and Joah said to the Assyrian chief of staff, "Please speak to us in Aramaic, for we understand it well. Don't speak in Hebrew��, for the people on the wall will hear." / ��Hebrew in the dialect of Judah; also in 18.28
122Kg 18:27 But Sennacherib's chief of staff replied, "Do you think my master sent this message only to you and your master? He wants all the people to hear it, for when we put this city under siege, they will suffer along with you. They will be so hungry and thirsty that they will eat their own dung and drink their own urine."
122Kg 18:28 Then the chief of staff stood and shouted in Hebrew to the people on the wall, "Listen to this message from the great king of Assyria!
122Kg 18:29 This is what the king says�� Don't let Hezekiah deceive you. He will never be able to rescue you from my power.
122Kg 18:30 Don't let him fool you into trusting in the LORD by saying, 'The LORD will surely rescue us. This city will never fall into the hands of the Assyrian king!'
122Kg 18:31 "Don't listen to Hezekiah! These are the terms the king of Assyria is offering�� Make peace with me - open the gates and come out. Then each of you can continue eating from your own grapevine and fig tree and drinking from your own well.
122Kg 18:32 Then I will arrange to take you to another land like this one - a land of grain and new wine, bread and vineyards, olive groves and honey. Choose life instead of death! "Don't listen to Hezekiah when he tries to mislead you by saying, 'The LORD will rescue us!'
122Kg 18:33 Have the gods of any other nations ever saved their people from the king of Assyria?
122Kg 18:34 What happened to the gods of Hamath and Arpad? And what about the gods of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah? Did any god rescue Samaria from my power?
122Kg 18:35 What god of any nation has ever been able to save its people from my power? So what makes you think that the LORD can rescue Jerusalem from me?"
122Kg 18:36 But the people were silent and did not utter a word because Hezekiah had commanded them, "Do not answer him."
122Kg 18:37 Then Eliakim son of Hilkiah, the palace administrator; Shebna the court secretary; and Joah son of Asaph, the royal historian, went back to Hezekiah. They tore their clothes in despair, and they went in to see the king and told him what the Assyrian chief of staff had said.
122Kg 19:1 When King Hezekiah heard their report, he tore his clothes and put on burlap and went into the Temple of the LORD.
122Kg 19:2 And he sent Eliakim the palace administrator, Shebna the court secretary, and the leading priests, all dressed in burlap, to the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
122Kg 19:3 They told him, "This is what King Hezekiah says�� Today is a day of trouble, insults, and disgrace. It is like when a child is ready to be born, but the mother has no strength to deliver the baby.
122Kg 19:4 But perhaps the LORD your God has heard the Assyrian chief of staff��, sent by the king to defy the living God, and will punish him for his words. Oh, pray for those of us who are left!" / ��Or the rabshakeh; also in 19.8
122Kg 19:5 After King Hezekiah's officials delivered the king's message to Isaiah,
122Kg 19:6 the prophet replied, "Say to your master, 'This is what the LORD says�� Do not be disturbed by this blasphemous speech against me from the Assyrian king's messengers.
122Kg 19:7 Listen! I myself will move against him��, and the king will receive a message that he is needed at home. So he will return to his land, where I will have him killed with a sword.'" / ��Hebrew I will put a spirit in him
122Kg 19:8 Meanwhile, the Assyrian chief of staff left Jerusalem and went to consult the king of Assyria, who had left Lachish and was attacking Libnah.
122Kg 19:9 Soon afterward King Sennacherib received word that King Tirhakah of Ethiopia�� was leading an army to fight against him. Before leaving to meet the attack, he sent messengers back to Hezekiah in Jerusalem with this message. / ��Hebrew of Cush
122Kg 19:10 "This message is for King Hezekiah of Judah. Don't let your God, in whom you trust, deceive you with promises that Jerusalem will not be captured by the king of Assyria.
122Kg 19:11 You know perfectly well what the kings of Assyria have done wherever they have gone. They have completely destroyed everyone who stood in their way! Why should you be any different?
122Kg 19:12 Have the gods of other nations rescued them - such nations as Gozan, Haran, Rezeph, and the people of Eden who were in Tel-assar? My predecessors destroyed them all!
122Kg 19:13 What happened to the king of Hamath and the king of Arpad? What happened to the kings of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivvah?"
122Kg 19:14 After Hezekiah received the letter from the messengers and read it, he went up to the LORD's Temple and spread it out before the LORD.
122Kg 19:15 And Hezekiah prayed this prayer before the LORD�� "O LORD, God of Israel, you are enthroned between the mighty cherubim! You alone are God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You alone created the heavens and the earth.
122Kg 19:16 Bend down, O LORD, and listen! Open your eyes, O LORD, and see! Listen to Sennacherib's words of defiance against the living God.
122Kg 19:17 "It is true, LORD, that the kings of Assyria have destroyed all these nations.
122Kg 19:18 And they have thrown the gods of these nations into the fire and burned them. But of course the Assyrians could destroy them! They were not gods at all - only idols of wood and stone shaped by human hands.
122Kg 19:19 Now, O LORD our God, rescue us from his power; then all the kingdoms of the earth will know that you alone, O LORD, are God."
122Kg 19:20 Then Isaiah son of Amoz sent this message to Hezekiah�� "This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says�� I have heard your prayer about King Sennacherib of Assyria.
122Kg 19:21 And the LORD has spoken this word against him�� "The virgin daughter of Zion despises you and laughs at you. The daughter of Jerusalem shakes her head in derision as you flee.
122Kg 19:22 "Whom have you been defying and ridiculing? Against whom did you raise your voice? At whom did you look with such haughty eyes? It was the Holy One of Israel!
122Kg 19:23 By your messengers you have defied the Lord.You have said, 'With my many chariots I have conquered the highest mountains - yes, the remotest peaks of Lebanon. I have cut down its tallest cedars and its finest cypress trees. I have reached its farthest corners and explored its deepest forests. 
122Kg 19:24 I have dug wells in many foreign lands and refreshed myself with their water. With the sole of my foot I stopped up all the rivers of Egypt!'
122Kg 19:25 "But have you not heard? I decided this long ago. Long ago I planned it, and now I am making it happen. I planned for you to crush fortified cities into heaps of rubble.
122Kg 19:26 That is why their people have so little power and are so frightened and confused. They are as weak as grass, as easily trampled as tender green shoots. They are like grass sprouting on a housetop, scorched before it can grow lush and tall.
122Kg 19:27 "But I know you well - where you stay and when you come and go.I know the way you have raged against me. 
122Kg 19:28 And because of your raging against me and your arrogance, which I have heard for myself, I will put my hook in your nose and my bit in your mouth. I will make you return by the same road on which you came."
122Kg 19:29 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Here is the proof that what I say is true�� "This year you will eat only what grows up by itself, and next year you will eat what springs up from that. But in the third year you will plant crops and harvest them; you will tend vineyards and eat their fruit.
122Kg 19:30 And you who are left in Judah, who have escaped the ravages of the siege, will put roots down in your own soil and will grow up and flourish.
122Kg 19:31 For a remnant of my people will spread out from Jerusalem, a group of survivors from Mount Zion.

122Kg 19:33 The king will return to his own country by the same road on which he came. He will not enter this city, says the LORD.
122Kg 19:34 For my own honor and for the sake of my servant David, I will defend this city and protect it."
122Kg 19:35 That night the angel of the LORD went out to the Assyrian camp and killed 185,000 Assyrian soldiers. When the surviving Assyrians�� woke up the next morning, they found corpses everywhere. / ��Hebrew When they
122Kg 19:36 Then King Sennacherib of Assyria broke camp and returned to his own land. He went home to his capital of Nineveh and stayed there.
122Kg 19:37 One day while he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, his sons�� Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with their swords. They then escaped to the land of Ararat, and another son, Esarhaddon, became the next king of Assyria. / ��As in Greek version and an alternate reading of the Masoretic Text (see also Isa 37.38); the other alternate reading lacks his sons
122Kg 20:1 About that time Hezekiah became deathly ill, and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz went to visit him. He gave the king this message�� "This is what the LORD says�� Set your affairs in order, for you are going to die. You will not recover from this illness."
122Kg 20:2 When Hezekiah heard this, he turned his face to the wall and prayed to the LORD,
122Kg 20:3 "Remember, O LORD, how I have always been faithful to you and have served you single-mindedly, always doing what pleases you." Then he broke down and wept bitterly.
122Kg 20:4 But before Isaiah had left the middle courtyard��, this message came to him from the LORD. / ��As in Greek version and an alternate reading in the Masoretic Text; the other alternate reads the middle of the city
122Kg 20:5 "Go back to Hezekiah, the leader of my people. Tell him, 'This is what the LORD, the God of your ancestor David, says�� I have heard your prayer and seen your tears. I will heal you, and three days from now you will get out of bed and go to the Temple of the LORD.
122Kg 20:6 I will add fifteen years to your life, and I will rescue you and this city from the king of Assyria. I will defend this city for my own honor and for the sake of my servant David.'"
122Kg 20:7 Then Isaiah said, "Make an ointment from figs." So Hezekiah's servants spread the ointment over the boil, and Hezekiah recovered!
122Kg 20:8 Meanwhile, Hezekiah had said to Isaiah, "What sign will the LORD give to prove that he will heal me and that I will go to the Temple of the LORD three days from now?"
122Kg 20:9 Isaiah replied, "This is the sign from the LORD to prove that he will do as he promised. Would you like the shadow on the sundial to go forward ten steps or backward ten steps?��" / ��Or The shadow on the sundial has gone forward ten steps; do you want it to go backward ten steps?
122Kg 20:10 "The shadow always moves forward," Hezekiah replied, "so that would be easy. Make it go ten steps backward instead."
122Kg 20:11 So Isaiah the prophet asked the LORD to do this, and he caused the shadow to move ten steps backward on the sundial�� of Ahaz! / ��Hebrew the steps
122Kg 20:12 Soon after this, Merodach-baladan son of Baladan, king of Babylon, sent Hezekiah his best wishes and a gift, for he had heard that Hezekiah had been very sick.
122Kg 20:13 Hezekiah received the Babylonian envoys and showed them everything in his treasure-houses - the silver, the gold, the spices, and the aromatic oils. He also took them to see his armory and showed them everything in his royal treasuries! There was nothing in his palace or kingdom that Hezekiah did not show them.
122Kg 20:14 Then Isaiah the prophet went to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did those men want? Where were they from?" Hezekiah replied, "They came from the distant land of Babylon."
122Kg 20:15 "What did they see in your palace?" Isaiah asked."They saw everything," Hezekiah replied. "I showed them everything I own - all my royal treasuries."
122Kg 20:16 Then Isaiah said to Hezekiah, "Listen to this message from the LORD.
122Kg 20:17 The time is coming when everything in your palace - all the treasures stored up by your ancestors until now - will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left, says the LORD.
122Kg 20:18 Some of your very own sons will be taken away into exile. They will become eunuchs who will serve in the palace of Babylon's king."
122Kg 20:19 Then Hezekiah said to Isaiah, "This message you have given me from the LORD is good." For the king was thinking, "At least there will be peace and security during my lifetime."
122Kg 20:20 The rest of the events in Hezekiah's reign, including the extent of his power and how he built a pool and dug a tunnel�� to bring water into the city, are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah. / ��Hebrew watercourse
122Kg 20:21 Hezekiah died, and his son Manasseh became the next king.
122Kg 21:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years. His mother was Hephzibah.
122Kg 21:2 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, following the detestable practices of the pagan nations that the LORD had driven from the land ahead of the Israelites.
122Kg 21:3 He rebuilt the pagan shrines his father, Hezekiah, had destroyed. He constructed altars for Baal and set up an Asherah pole, just as King Ahab of Israel had done. He also bowed before all the powers of the heavens and worshiped them.
122Kg 21:4 He built pagan altars in the Temple of the LORD, the place where the LORD had said, "My name will remain in Jerusalem forever."
122Kg 21:5 He built these altars for all the powers of the heavens in both courtyards of the LORD's Temple.
122Kg 21:6 Manasseh also sacrificed his own son in the fire��. He practiced sorcery and divination, and he consulted with mediums and psychics. He did much that was evil in the LORD's sight, arousing his anger. / ��Or also made his son pass through the fire
122Kg 21:7 Manasseh even made a carved image of Asherah and set it up in the Temple, the very place where the LORD had told David and his son Solomon�� "My name will be honored forever in this Temple and in Jerusalem - the city I have chosen from among all the tribes of Israel.
122Kg 21:8 If the Israelites will be careful to obey my commands - all the laws my servant Moses gave them - I will not send them into exile from this land that I gave their ancestors."
122Kg 21:9 But the people refused to listen, and Manasseh led them to do even more evil than the pagan nations that the LORD had destroyed when the people of Israel entered the land.
122Kg 21:10 Then the LORD said through his servants the prophets.
122Kg 21:11 "King Manasseh of Judah has done many detestable things. He is even more wicked than the Amorites, who lived in this land before Israel. He has caused the people of Judah to sin with his idols��. / ��The Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung; also in 21.21
122Kg 21:12 So this is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says�� I will bring such disaster on Jerusalem and Judah that the ears of those who hear about it will tingle with horror.
122Kg 21:13 I will judge Jerusalem by the same standard I used for Samaria and the same measure�� I used for the family of Ahab. I will wipe away the people of Jerusalem as one wipes a dish and turns it upside down. / ��Hebrew the same plumb line I used for Samaria and the same plumb bob
122Kg 21:14 Then I will reject even the remnant of my own people who are left, and I will hand them over as plunder for their enemies.
122Kg 21:15 For they have done great evil in my sight and have angered me ever since their ancestors came out of Egypt."
122Kg 21:16 Manasseh also murdered many innocent people until Jerusalem was filled from one end to the other with innocent blood. This was in addition to the sin that he caused the people of Judah to commit, leading them to do evil in the LORD's sight.
122Kg 21:17 The rest of the events in Manasseh's reign and everything he did, including the sins he committed, are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 21:18 When Manasseh died, he was buried in the palace garden, the garden of Uzza. Then his son Amon became the next king.
122Kg 21:19 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years. His mother was Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz from Jotbah.
122Kg 21:20 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, just as his father, Manasseh, had done.
122Kg 21:21 He followed the example of his father, worshiping the same idols his father had worshiped.
122Kg 21:22 He abandoned the LORD, the God of his ancestors, and he refused to follow the LORD's ways.
122Kg 21:23 Then Amon's own officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace.
122Kg 21:24 But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah the next king.
122Kg 21:25 The rest of the events in Amon's reign and what he did are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 21:26 He was buried in his tomb in the garden of Uzza. Then his son Josiah became the next king.
122Kg 22:1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years. His mother was Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah from Bozkath.
122Kg 22:2 He did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight and followed the example of his ancestor David. He did not turn away from doing what was right.
122Kg 22:3 In the eighteenth year of his reign, King Josiah sent Shaphan son of Azaliah and grandson of Meshullam, the court secretary, to the Temple of the LORD. He told him,
122Kg 22:4 "Go to Hilkiah the high priest and have him count the money the gatekeepers have collected from the people at the LORD's Temple.
122Kg 22:5 Entrust this money to the men assigned to supervise the Temple's restoration. Then they can use it to pay workers to repair the Temple of the LORD.
122Kg 22:6 They will need to hire carpenters, builders, and masons. Also have them buy the timber and the finished stone needed to repair the Temple.
122Kg 22:7 But don't require the construction supervisors to keep account of the money they receive, for they are honest and trustworthy men."
122Kg 22:8 Hilkiah the high priest said to Shaphan the court secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the LORD's Temple!" Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan, and he read it.
122Kg 22:9 Shaphan went to the king and reported, "Your officials have turned over the money collected at the Temple of the LORD to the workers and supervisors at the Temple."
122Kg 22:10 Shaphan also told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll." So Shaphan read it to the king.
122Kg 22:11 When the king heard what was written in the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes in despair.
122Kg 22:12 Then he gave these orders to Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah, Shaphan the court secretary, and Asaiah the king's personal adviser.
122Kg 22:13 "Go to the Temple and speak to the LORD for me and for the people and for all Judah. Inquire about the words written in this scroll that has been found. For the LORD's great anger is burning against us because our ancestors have not obeyed the words in this scroll. We have not been doing everything it says we must do."
122Kg 22:14 So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Acbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to the New Quarter�� of Jerusalem to consult with the prophet Huldah. She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, son of Harhas, the keeper of the Temple wardrobe. / ��Or the Second Quarter, a newer section of Jerusalem. Hebrew reads the Mishneh
122Kg 22:15 She said to them, "The LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken! Go back and tell the man who sent you,
122Kg 22:16 'This is what the LORD says�� I am going to bring disaster on this city�� and its people. All the words written in the scroll that the king of Judah has read will come true. / ��Hebrew this place; also in 22.19, 20
122Kg 22:17 For my people have abandoned me and offered sacrifices to pagan gods, and I am very angry with them for everything they have done. My anger will burn against this place, and it will not be quenched.'
122Kg 22:18 "But go to the king of Judah who sent you to seek the LORD and tell him�� 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the message you have just heard.
122Kg 22:19 You were sorry and humbled yourself before the LORD when you heard what I said against this city and its people - that this land would be cursed and become desolate. You tore your clothing in despair and wept before me in repentance. And I have indeed heard you, says the LORD.
122Kg 22:20 So I will not send the promised disaster until after you have died and been buried in peace. You will not see the disaster I am going to bring on this city.'" So they took her message back to the king.
122Kg 23:1 Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
122Kg 23:2 And the king went up to the Temple of the LORD with all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, along with the priests and the prophets - all the people from the least to the greatest. There the king read to them the entire Book of the Covenant that had been found in the LORD's Temple.
122Kg 23:3 The king took his place of authority beside the pillar and renewed the covenant in the LORD's presence. He pledged to obey the LORD by keeping all his commands, laws, and decrees with all his heart and soul. In this way, he confirmed all the terms of the covenant that were written in the scroll, and all the people pledged themselves to the covenant.
122Kg 23:4 Then the king instructed Hilkiah the high priest and the priests of the second rank and the Temple gatekeepers to remove from the LORD's Temple all the articles that were used to worship Baal, Asherah, and all the powers of the heavens. The king had all these things burned outside Jerusalem on the terraces of the Kidron Valley, and he carried the ashes away to Bethel.
122Kg 23:5 He did away with the idolatrous priests, who had been appointed by the previous kings of Judah, for they had offered sacrifices at the pagan shrines throughout Judah and even in the vicinity of Jerusalem. They had also offered sacrifices to Baal, and to the sun, the moon, the constellations, and to all the powers of the heavens.
122Kg 23:6 The king removed the Asherah pole from the LORD's Temple and took it outside Jerusalem to the Kidron Valley, where he burned it. Then he ground the ashes of the pole to dust and threw the dust over the graves of the people.
122Kg 23:7 He also tore down the living quarters of the male and female shrine prostitutes that were inside the Temple of the LORD, where the women wove coverings for the Asherah pole.
122Kg 23:8 Josiah brought to Jerusalem all the priests who were living in other towns of Judah. He also defiled the pagan shrines, where they had offered sacrifices - all the way from Geba to Beersheba. He destroyed the shrines at the entrance to the gate of Joshua, the governor of Jerusalem. This gate was located to the left of the city gate as one enters the city.
122Kg 23:9 The priests who had served at the pagan shrines were not allowed�� to serve at the LORD's altar in Jerusalem, but they were allowed to eat unleavened bread with the other priests. / ��Hebrew did not come up
122Kg 23:10 Then the king defiled the altar of Topheth in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, so no one could ever again use it to sacrifice a son or daughter in the fire�� as an offering to Molech. / ��Or to make a son or daughter pass through the fire
122Kg 23:11 He removed from the entrance of the LORD's Temple the horse statues that the former kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun. They were near the quarters of Nathan-melech the eunuch, an officer of the court��. The king also burned the chariots dedicated to the sun. / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
122Kg 23:12 Josiah tore down the altars that the kings of Judah had built on the palace roof above the upper room of Ahaz. The king destroyed the altars that Manasseh had built in the two courtyards of the LORD's Temple. He smashed them to bits�� and scattered the pieces in the Kidron Valley. / ��Or He quickly removed them
122Kg 23:13 The king also desecrated the pagan shrines east of Jerusalem, to the south of the Mount of Corruption, where King Solomon of Israel had built shrines for Ashtoreth, the detestable goddess of the Sidonians; and for Chemosh, the detestable god of the Moabites; and for Molech��, the vile god of the Ammonites. / ��Hebrew Milcom, a variant spelling of Molech
122Kg 23:14 He smashed the sacred pillars and cut down the Asherah poles. Then he desecrated these places by scattering human bones over them.
122Kg 23:15 The king also tore down the altar at Bethel - the pagan shrine that Jeroboam son of Nebat had made when he caused Israel to sin. He burned down the shrine and ground it to dust, and he burned the Asherah pole.
122Kg 23:16 Then Josiah turned around and noticed several tombs in the side of the hill. He ordered that the bones be brought out, and he burned them on the altar at Bethel to desecrate it. (This happened just as the LORD had promised through the man of God when Jeroboam stood beside the altar at the festival.) Then Josiah turned and looked up at the tomb of the man of God�� who had predicted these things. / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew lacks when Jeroboam stood beside the altar at the festival. Then Josiah turned and looked up at the tomb of the man of God
122Kg 23:17 "What is that monument over there?" Josiah asked.And the people of the town told him, "It is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah and predicted the very things that you have just done to the altar at Bethel!"
122Kg 23:18 Josiah replied, "Leave it alone. Don't disturb his bones." So they did not burn his bones or those of the old prophet from Samaria.
122Kg 23:19 Then Josiah demolished all the buildings at the pagan shrines in the towns of Samaria, just as he had done at Bethel. They had been built by the various kings of Israel and had made the LORD�� very angry. / ��As in Greek and Syriac versions and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew lacks the LORD
122Kg 23:20 He executed the priests of the pagan shrines on their own altars, and he burned human bones on the altars to desecrate them. Finally, he returned to Jerusalem.
122Kg 23:21 King Josiah then issued this order to all the people�� "You must celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God, as required in this Book of the Covenant."
122Kg 23:22 There had not been a Passover celebration like that since the time when the judges ruled in Israel, nor throughout all the years of the kings of Israel and Judah.
122Kg 23:23 This Passover was celebrated to the LORD in Jerusalem in the eighteenth year of King Josiah's reign.
122Kg 23:24 Josiah also got rid of the mediums and psychics, the household gods, the idols��, and every other kind of detestable practice, both in Jerusalem and throughout the land of Judah. He did this in obedience to the laws written in the scroll that Hilkiah the priest had found in the LORD's Temple. / ��The Hebrew term (literally round things) probably alludes to dung
122Kg 23:25 Never before had there been a king like Josiah, who turned to the LORD with all his heart and soul and strength, obeying all the laws of Moses. And there has never been a king like him since.
122Kg 23:26 Even so, the LORD was very angry with Judah because of all the wicked things Manasseh had done to provoke him.
122Kg 23:27 For the LORD said, "I will also banish Judah from my presence just as I have banished Israel. And I will reject my chosen city of Jerusalem and the Temple where my name was to be honored."
122Kg 23:28 The rest of the events in Josiah's reign and all his deeds are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 23:29 While Josiah was king, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, went to the Euphrates River to help the king of Assyria. King Josiah and his army marched out to fight him��, but King Neco�� killed him when they met at Megiddo. / ��Or Josiah went out to meet him ��Hebrew he
122Kg 23:30 Josiah's officers took his body back in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in his own tomb. Then the people of the land anointed Josiah's son Jehoahaz and made him the next king.
122Kg 23:31 Jehoahaz was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.
122Kg 23:32 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, just as his ancestors had done.
122Kg 23:33 Pharaoh Neco put Jehoahaz in prison at Riblah in the land of Hamath to prevent him from ruling�� in Jerusalem. He also demanded that Judah pay 7,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold�� as tribute. / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain ��Hebrew 100 talents [3,400 kilograms] of silver and 1 talent [34 kilograms] of gold
122Kg 23:34 Pharaoh Neco then installed Eliakim, another of Josiah's sons, to reign in place of his father, and he changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim. Jehoahaz was taken to Egypt as a prisoner, where he died.
122Kg 23:35 In order to get the silver and gold demanded as tribute by Pharaoh Neco, Jehoiakim collected a tax from the people of Judah, requiring them to pay in proportion to their wealth.
122Kg 23:36 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother was Zebidah, the daughter of Pedaiah from Rumah.
122Kg 23:37 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, just as his ancestors had done.
122Kg 24:1 During Jehoiakim's reign, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon invaded the land of Judah. Jehoiakim surrendered and paid him tribute for three years but then rebelled.
122Kg 24:2 Then the LORD sent bands of Babylonian��, Aramean, Moabite, and Ammonite raiders against Judah to destroy it, just as the LORD had promised through his prophets.
122Kg 24:3 These disasters happened to Judah because of the LORD's command. He had decided to banish Judah from his presence because of the many sins of Manasseh, / ��Or Chaldean
122Kg 24:4 who had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood. The LORD would not forgive this.
122Kg 24:5 The rest of the events in Jehoiakim's reign and all his deeds are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Judah.
122Kg 24:6 When Jehoiakim died, his son Jehoiachin became the next king.
122Kg 24:7 The king of Egypt did not venture out of his country after that, for the king of Babylon captured the entire area formerly claimed by Egypt - from the Brook of Egypt to the Euphrates River.
122Kg 24:8 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. His mother was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan from Jerusalem.
122Kg 24:9 Jehoiachin did what was evil in the LORD's sight, just as his father had done.
122Kg 24:10 During Jehoiachin's reign, the officers of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up against Jerusalem and besieged it.
122Kg 24:11 Nebuchadnezzar himself arrived at the city during the siege.
122Kg 24:12 Then King Jehoiachin, along with the queen mother, his advisers, his commanders, and his officials, surrendered to the Babylonians.In the eighth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, he took Jehoiachin prisoner.
122Kg 24:13 As the LORD had said beforehand, Nebuchadnezzar carried away all the treasures from the LORD's Temple and the royal palace. He stripped away�� all the gold objects that King Solomon of Israel had placed in the Temple. / ��Or He cut apart
122Kg 24:14 King Nebuchadnezzar took all of Jerusalem captive, including all the commanders and the best of the soldiers, craftsmen, and artisans - 10,000 in all. Only the poorest people were left in the land.
122Kg 24:15 Nebuchadnezzar led King Jehoiachin away as a captive to Babylon, along with the queen mother, his wives and officials, and all Jerusalem's elite.
122Kg 24:16 He also exiled 7,000 of the best troops and 1,000 craftsmen and artisans, all of whom were strong and fit for war.
122Kg 24:17 Then the king of Babylon installed Mattaniah, Jehoiachin's�� uncle, as the next king, and he changed Mattaniah's name to Zedekiah. / ��Hebrew his
122Kg 24:18 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. His mother was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah from Libnah.
122Kg 24:19 But Zedekiah did what was evil in the LORD's sight, just as Jehoiakim had done.
122Kg 24:20 These things happened because of the LORD's anger against the people of Jerusalem and Judah, until he finally banished them from his presence and sent them into exile. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.
122Kg 25:1 So on January 15��, during the ninth year of Zedekiah's reign, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon led his entire army against Jerusalem. They surrounded the city and built siege ramps against its walls. / ��Hebrew on the tenth day of the tenth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. A number of events in 2 Kings can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Babylonian records and related accurately to our modern calendar. This day was January 15, 588 B.C.
122Kg 25:2 Jerusalem was kept under siege until the eleventh year of King Zedekiah's reign.
122Kg 25:3 By July 18 in the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign��, the famine in the city had become very severe, and the last of the food was entirely gone. / ��Hebrew By the ninth day of the [fourth] month [in the eleventh year of Zedekiah's reign] (compare Jer 52.6 and the note there). This day was July 18, 586 B.C.; also see note on 25.1
122Kg 25:4 Then a section of the city wall was broken down, and all the soldiers fled. Since the city was surrounded by the Babylonians��, they waited for nightfall. Then they slipped through the gate between the two walls behind the king's garden and headed toward the Jordan Valley��. / ��Or the Chaldeans; also in 25.13, 25, 26 ��Hebrew the Arabah
122Kg 25:5 But the Babylonian�� troops chased the king and caught him on the plains of Jericho, for his men had all deserted him and scattered. / ��Or Chaldean; also in 25.10, 24
122Kg 25:6 They took him to the king of Babylon at Riblah, where they pronounced judgment upon Zedekiah.
122Kg 25:7 They made Zedekiah watch as they slaughtered his sons. Then they gouged out Zedekiah's eyes, bound him in bronze chains, and led him away to Babylon.
122Kg 25:8 On August 14 of that year��, which was the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar's reign, Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard and an official of the Babylonian king, arrived in Jerusalem. / ��Hebrew On the seventh day of the fifth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was August 14, 586 B.C.; also see note on 25.1
122Kg 25:9 He burned down the Temple of the LORD, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem. He destroyed all the important buildings�� in the city. / ��Or destroyed the houses of all the important people
122Kg 25:10 Then he supervised the entire Babylonian army as they tore down the walls of Jerusalem on every side.
122Kg 25:11 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, then took as exiles the rest of the people who remained in the city, the defectors who had declared their allegiance to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the population.
122Kg 25:12 But the captain of the guard allowed some of the poorest people to stay behind in Judah to care for the vineyards and fields.
122Kg 25:13 The Babylonians broke up the bronze pillars in front of the LORD's Temple, the bronze water carts, and the great bronze basin called the Sea, and they carried all the bronze away to Babylon.
122Kg 25:14 They also took all the ash buckets, shovels, lamp snuffers, dishes, and all the other bronze articles used for making sacrifices at the Temple.
122Kg 25:15 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, also took the incense burners and basins, and all the other articles made of pure gold or silver.
122Kg 25:16 The weight of the bronze from the two pillars, the Sea, and the water carts was too great to be measured. These things had been made for the LORD's Temple in the days of King Solomon.
122Kg 25:17 Each of the pillars was 27 feet�� tall. The bronze capital on top of each pillar was 7 1/2 feet�� ��As in parallel texts at 1 Kgs 7.16, 2 Chr 3.15, and Jer 52.22, all of which read 5 cubits [2.3 meters]; Hebrew reads 3 cubits, which is 4.5 feet or 1.4 meters high and was decorated with a network of bronze pomegranates all the way around. / ��Hebrew 18 cubits [8.1 meters]
122Kg 25:18 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took with him as prisoners Seraiah the high priest, Zephaniah the priest of the second rank, and the three chief gatekeepers.
122Kg 25:19 And from among the people still hiding in the city, he took an officer who had been in charge of the Judean army; five of the king's personal advisers; the army commander's chief secretary, who was in charge of recruitment; and sixty other citizens.
122Kg 25:20 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, took them all to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
122Kg 25:21 And there at Riblah, in the land of Hamath, the king of Babylon had them all put to death. So the people of Judah were sent into exile from their land.
122Kg 25:22 Then King Nebuchadnezzar appointed Gedaliah son of Ahikam and grandson of Shaphan as governor over the people he had left in Judah.
122Kg 25:23 When all the army commanders and their men learned that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah as governor, they went to see him at Mizpah. These included Ishmael son of Nethaniah, Johanan son of Kareah, Seraiah son of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jezaniah�� son of the Maacathite, and all their men. / ��As in parallel text at Jer 40.8; Hebrew reads Jaazaniah, a variant spelling of Jezaniah
122Kg 25:24 Gedaliah vowed to them that the Babylonian officials meant them no harm. "Don't be afraid of them. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and all will go well for you," he promised.
122Kg 25:25 But in midautumn of that year��, Ishmael son of Nethaniah and grandson of Elishama, who was of the royal family, went to Mizpah with ten men and killed Gedaliah. He also killed all the Judeans and Babylonians who were with Gedaliah at Mizpah. / ��Hebrew in the seventh month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This month occurred within the months of October and November 586 B.C.; also see note on 25.1
122Kg 25:26 Then all the people of Judah, from the least to the greatest, as well as the army commanders, fled in panic to Egypt, for they were afraid of what the Babylonians would do to them.
122Kg 25:27 In the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah, Evil-merodach ascended to the Babylonian throne. He was kind to�� Jehoiachin and released him from prison on April 2 of that year��. / ��Hebrew He raised the head of ��Hebrew on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was April 2, 561 B.C.; also see note on 25.1
122Kg 25:28 He spoke kindly to Jehoiachin and gave him a higher place than all the other exiled kings in Babylon.
122Kg 25:29 He supplied Jehoiachin with new clothes to replace his prison garb and allowed him to dine in the king's presence for the rest of his life.
122Kg 25:30 So the Babylonian king gave him a regular food allowance as long as he lived.

131Ch 11:5 The people of Jebus taunted David, saying, "You'll never get in here!" But David captured the fortress of Zion, which is now called the City of David.
131Ch 11:6 David had said to his troops, "Whoever is first to attack the Jebusites will become the commander of my armies!" And Joab, the son of David's sister Zeruiah, was first to attack, so he became the commander of David's armies.
131Ch 11:7 David made the fortress his home, and that is why it is called the City of David.
131Ch 11:8 He extended the city from the supporting terraces�� to the surrounding area, while Joab rebuilt the rest of Jerusalem. / ��Hebrew the millo. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
131Ch 11:9 And David became more and more powerful, because the LORD of Heaven's Armies was with him.
131Ch 11:10 These are the leaders of David's mighty warriors. Together with all Israel, they decided to make David their king, just as the LORD had promised concerning Israel.
131Ch 11:11 Here is the record of David's mightiest warriors�� The first was Jashobeam the Hacmonite, who was leader of the Three - the mightiest warriors among David's men��. He once used his spear to kill 300 enemy warriors in a single battle. / ��As in some Greek manuscripts (see also 2 Sam 23.8); Hebrew reads leader of the Thirty, or leader of the captains
131Ch 11:12 Next in rank among the Three was Eleazar son of Dodai��, a descendant of Ahoah. / ��As in parallel text at 2 Sam 23.9 (see also 1 Chr 27.4); Hebrew reads Dodo, a variant spelling of Dodai
131Ch 11:13 He was with David in the battle against the Philistines at Pas-dammim. The battle took place in a field full of barley, and the Israelite army fled.
131Ch 11:14 But Eleazar and David�� held their ground in the middle of the field and beat back the Philistines. So the LORD saved them by giving them a great victory. / ��Hebrew they
131Ch 11:15 Once when David was at the rock near the cave of Adullam, the Philistine army was camped in the valley of Rephaim. The Three (who were among the Thirty - an elite group among David's fighting men) went down to meet him there.
131Ch 11:16 David was staying in the stronghold at the time, and a Philistine detachment had occupied the town of Bethlehem.
131Ch 11:17 David remarked longingly to his men, "Oh, how I would love some of that good water from the well by the gate in Bethlehem."
131Ch 11:18 So the Three broke through the Philistine lines, drew some water from the well by the gate in Bethlehem, and brought it back to David. But David refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out as an offering to the LORD.
131Ch 11:19 "God forbid that I should drink this!" he exclaimed. "This water is as precious as the blood of these men�� who risked their lives to bring it to me." So David did not drink it. These are examples of the exploits of the Three. / ��Hebrew Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men?
131Ch 11:20 Abishai, the brother of Joab, was the leader of the Thirty��. He once used his spear to kill 300 enemy warriors in a single battle. It was by such feats that he became as famous as the Three. / ��As in Syriac version; Hebrew reads the Three; also in 11.21
131Ch 11:21 Abishai was the most famous of the Thirty and was their commander, though he was not one of the Three.
131Ch 11:22 There was also Benaiah son of Jehoiada, a valiant warrior from Kabzeel. He did many heroic deeds, which included killing two champions�� of Moab. Another time, on a snowy day, he chased a lion down into a pit and killed it. / ��Or two sons of Ariel
131Ch 11:23 Once, armed only with a club, he killed an Egyptian warrior who was 7 1/2 feet�� tall and whose spear was as thick as a weaver's beam. Benaiah wrenched the spear from the Egyptian's hand and killed him with it. / ��Hebrew 5 cubits [2.3 meters]
131Ch 11:24 Deeds like these made Benaiah as famous as the three mightiest warriors.
131Ch 11:25 He was more honored than the other members of the Thirty, though he was not one of the Three. And David made him captain of his bodyguard.

131Ch 12:15 These were the men who crossed the Jordan River during its seasonal flooding at the beginning of the year and drove out all the people living in the lowlands on both the east and west banks.
131Ch 12:16 Others from Benjamin and Judah came to David at the stronghold.
131Ch 12:17 David went out to meet them and said, "If you have come in peace to help me, we are friends. But if you have come to betray me to my enemies when I am innocent, then may the God of our ancestors see it and punish you."
131Ch 12:18 Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, the leader of the Thirty, and he said, "We are yours, David! We are on your side, son of Jesse. Peace and prosperity be with you, and success to all who help you, for your God is the one who helps you." So David let them join him, and he made them officers over his troops.
131Ch 12:19 Some men from Manasseh defected from the Israelite army and joined David when he set out with the Philistines to fight against Saul. But as it turned out, the Philistine rulers refused to let David and his men go with them. After much discussion, they sent them back, for they said, "It will cost us our heads if David switches loyalties to Saul and turns against us."
131Ch 12:20 Here is a list of the men from Manasseh who defected to David as he was returning to Ziklag�� Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai. Each commanded 1,000 troops from the tribe of Manasseh.
131Ch 12:21 They helped David chase down bands of raiders, for they were all brave and able warriors who became commanders in his army.
131Ch 12:22 Day after day more men joined David until he had a great army, like the army of God.
131Ch 12:23 These are the numbers of armed warriors who joined David at Hebron. They were all eager to see David become king instead of Saul, just as the LORD had promised.

131Ch 12:37 From the east side of the Jordan River - where the tribes of Reuben and Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh lived - there were 120,000 troops armed with every kind of weapon.
131Ch 12:38 All these men came in battle array to Hebron with the single purpose of making David the king over all Israel. In fact, everyone in Israel agreed that David should be their king.
131Ch 12:39 They feasted and drank with David for three days, for preparations had been made by their relatives for their arrival.
131Ch 12:40 And people from as far away as Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali brought food on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. Vast supplies of flour, fig cakes, clusters of raisins, wine, olive oil, cattle, sheep, and goats were brought to the celebration. There was great joy throughout the land of Israel.
131Ch 13:1 David consulted with all his officials, including the generals and captains of his army��. / ��Hebrew the commanders of thousands and of hundreds
131Ch 13:2 Then he addressed the entire assembly of Israel as follows�� "If you approve and if it is the will of the LORD our God, let us send messages to all the Israelites throughout the land, including the priests and Levites in their towns and pasturelands. Let us invite them to come and join us.
131Ch 13:3 It is time to bring back the Ark of our God, for we neglected it during the reign of Saul."
131Ch 13:4 The whole assembly agreed to this, for the people could see it was the right thing to do.
131Ch 13:5 So David summoned all Israel, from the Shihor Brook of Egypt in the south all the way to the town of Lebo-hamath in the north, to join in bringing the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
131Ch 13:6 Then David and all Israel went to Baalah of Judah (also called Kiriath-jearim) to bring back the Ark of God, which bears the name�� of the LORD who is enthroned between the cherubim. / ��Or the Ark of God, where the Name is proclaimed - the name

131Ch 13:9 But when they arrived at the threshing floor of Nacon��, the oxen stumbled, and Uzzah reached out his hand to steady the Ark. / ��As in parallel text at 2 Sam 6.6; Hebrew reads Kidon
131Ch 13:10 Then the LORD's anger was aroused against Uzzah, and he struck him dead because he had laid his hand on the Ark. So Uzzah died there in the presence of God.
131Ch 13:11 David was angry because the LORD's anger had burst out against Uzzah. He named that place Perez-uzzah (which means "to burst out against Uzzah"), as it is still called today.
131Ch 13:12 David was now afraid of God, and he asked, "How can I ever bring the Ark of God back into my care?"
131Ch 13:13 So David did not move the Ark into the City of David. Instead, he took it to the house of Obed-edom of Gath.
131Ch 13:14 The Ark of God remained there in Obed-edom's house for three months, and the LORD blessed the household of Obed-edom and everything he owned.
131Ch 14:1 Then King Hiram of Tyre sent messengers to David, along with cedar timber, and stonemasons and carpenters to build him a palace.
131Ch 14:2 And David realized that the LORD had confirmed him as king over Israel and had greatly blessed his kingdom for the sake of his people Israel.
131Ch 14:3 Then David married more wives in Jerusalem, and they had more sons and daughters.

131Ch 14:8 When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over all Israel, they mobilized all their forces to capture him. But David was told they were coming, so he marched out to meet them.
131Ch 14:9 The Philistines arrived and made a raid in the valley of Rephaim.
131Ch 14:10 So David asked God, "Should I go out to fight the Philistines? Will you hand them over to me?" The LORD replied, "Yes, go ahead. I will hand them over to you."
131Ch 14:11 So David and his troops went up to Baal-perazim and defeated the Philistines there. "God did it!" David exclaimed. "He used me to burst through my enemies like a raging flood!" So they named that place Baal-perazim (which means "the Lord who bursts through").
131Ch 14:12 The Philistines had abandoned their gods there, so David gave orders to burn them.
131Ch 14:13 But after a while the Philistines returned and raided the valley again.
131Ch 14:14 And once again David asked God what to do. "Do not attack them straight on," God replied. "Instead, circle around behind and attack them near the poplar�� trees. / ��Or aspen, or balsam; also in 14.15. The exact identification of this tree is uncertain
131Ch 14:15 When you hear a sound like marching feet in the tops of the poplar trees, go out and attack! That will be the signal that God is moving ahead of you to strike down the Philistine army."
131Ch 14:16 So David did what God commanded, and they struck down the Philistine army all the way from Gibeon to Gezer.
131Ch 14:17 So David's fame spread everywhere, and the LORD caused all the nations to fear David.
131Ch 15:1 David now built several buildings for himself in the City of David. He also prepared a place for the Ark of God and set up a special tent for it.
131Ch 15:2 Then he commanded, "No one except the Levites may carry the Ark of God. The LORD has chosen them to carry the Ark of the LORD and to serve him forever."
131Ch 15:3 Then David summoned all Israel to Jerusalem to bring the Ark of the LORD to the place he had prepared for it.
131Ch 15:4 This is the number of the descendants of Aaron (the priests) and the Levites who were called together.
131Ch 15:5 From the clan of Kohath, 120, with Uriel as their leader.

131Ch 15:10 From the descendants of Uzziel, 112, with Amminadab as their leader.
131Ch 15:11 Then David summoned the priests, Zadok and Abiathar, and these Levite leaders�� Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab.
131Ch 15:12 He said to them, "You are the leaders of the Levite families. You must purify yourselves and all your fellow Levites, so you can bring the Ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to the place I have prepared for it.
131Ch 15:13 Because you Levites did not carry the Ark the first time, the anger of the LORD our God burst out against us. We failed to ask God how to move it properly."
131Ch 15:14 So the priests and the Levites purified themselves in order to bring the Ark of the LORD, the God of Israel, to Jerusalem.
131Ch 15:15 Then the Levites carried the Ark of God on their shoulders with its carrying poles, just as the LORD had instructed Moses.
131Ch 15:16 David also ordered the Levite leaders to appoint a choir of Levites who were singers and musicians to sing joyful songs to the accompaniment of harps, lyres, and cymbals.
131Ch 15:17 So the Levites appointed Heman son of Joel along with his fellow Levites�� Asaph son of Berekiah, and Ethan son of Kushaiah from the clan of Merari.

131Ch 15:26 And because God was clearly helping the Levites as they carried the Ark of the LORD's Covenant, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams.

131Ch 15:28 So all Israel brought up the Ark of the LORD's Covenant with shouts of joy, the blowing of rams' horns and trumpets, the crashing of cymbals, and loud playing on harps and lyres.
131Ch 15:29 But as the Ark of the LORD's Covenant entered the City of David, Michal, the daughter of Saul, looked down from her window. When she saw King David skipping about and laughing with joy, she was filled with contempt for him.
131Ch 16:1 They brought the Ark of God and placed it inside the special tent David had prepared for it. And they presented burnt offerings and peace offerings to God.
131Ch 16:2 When he had finished his sacrifices, David blessed the people in the name of the LORD.
131Ch 16:3 Then he gave to every man and woman in all Israel a loaf of bread, a cake of dates��, and a cake of raisins. / ��Or a portion of meat. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
131Ch 16:4 David appointed the following Levites to lead the people in worship before the Ark of the LORD - to invoke his blessings, to give thanks, and to praise the LORD, the God of Israel.
131Ch 16:5 Asaph, the leader of this group, sounded the cymbals. Second to him was Zechariah, followed by Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel. They played the harps and lyres.

131Ch 16:40 They sacrificed the regular burnt offerings to the LORD each morning and evening on the altar set aside for that purpose, obeying everything written in the Law of the LORD, as he had commanded Israel.
131Ch 16:41 David also appointed Heman, Jeduthun, and the others chosen by name to give thanks to the LORD, for "his faithful love endures forever."
131Ch 16:42 They used their trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments to accompany their songs of praise to God��. And the sons of Jeduthun were appointed as gatekeepers. / ��Or to accompany the sacred music; or to accompany singing to God
131Ch 16:43 Then all the people returned to their homes, and David turned and went home to bless his own family. 
131Ch 17:1 When David was settled in his palace, he summoned Nathan the prophet. "Look," David said, "I am living in a beautiful cedar palace��, but the Ark of the LORD's Covenant is out there under a tent!" / ��Hebrew a house of cedar
131Ch 17:2 Nathan replied to David, "Do whatever you have in mind, for God is with you."
131Ch 17:3 But that same night God said to Nathan,
131Ch 17:4 "Go and tell my servant David, 'This is what the LORD has declared�� You are not the one to build a house for me to live in.
131Ch 17:5 I have never lived in a house, from the day I brought the Israelites out of Egypt until this very day. My home has always been a tent, moving from one place to another in a Tabernacle.
131Ch 17:6 Yet no matter where I have gone with the Israelites, I have never once complained to Israel's leaders��, the shepherds of my people. I have never asked them, "Why haven't you built me a beautiful cedar house?"' / ��As in Greek version (see also 2 Sam 7.7); Hebrew reads judges
131Ch 17:7 "Now go and say to my servant David, 'This is what the LORD of Heaven's Armies has declared�� I took you from tending sheep in the pasture and selected you to be the leader of my people Israel.
131Ch 17:8 I have been with you wherever you have gone, and I have destroyed all your enemies before your eyes. Now I will make your name as famous as anyone who has ever lived on the earth!
131Ch 17:9 And I will provide a homeland for my people Israel, planting them in a secure place where they will never be disturbed. Evil nations won't oppress them as they've done in the past,
131Ch 17:10 starting from the time I appointed judges to rule my people Israel. And I will defeat all your enemies."'Furthermore, I declare that the LORD will build a house for you - a dynasty of kings!
131Ch 17:11 For when you die and join your ancestors, I will raise up one of your descendants, one of your sons, and I will make his kingdom strong.
131Ch 17:12 He is the one who will build a house - a temple - for me. And I will secure his throne forever.
131Ch 17:13 I will be his father, and he will be my son. I will never take my favor from him as I took it from the one who ruled before you.
131Ch 17:14 I will confirm him as king over my house and my kingdom for all time, and his throne will be secure forever.'"
131Ch 17:15 So Nathan went back to David and told him everything the LORD had said in this vision.
131Ch 17:16 Then King David went in and sat before the LORD and prayed, "Who am I, O LORD God, and what is my family, that you have brought me this far?
131Ch 17:17 And now, O God, in addition to everything else, you speak of giving your servant a lasting dynasty! You speak as though I were someone very great��, O LORD God! / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
131Ch 17:18 "What more can I say to you about the way you have honored me? You know what your servant is really like.
131Ch 17:19 For the sake of your servant, O LORD, and according to your will, you have done all these great things and have made them known.
131Ch 17:20 "O LORD, there is no one like you. We have never even heard of another God like you!
131Ch 17:21 What other nation on earth is like your people Israel? What other nation, O God, have you redeemed from slavery to be your own people? You made a great name for yourself when you redeemed your people from Egypt. You performed awesome miracles and drove out the nations that stood in their way.
131Ch 17:22 You chose Israel to be your very own people forever, and you, O LORD, became their God.
131Ch 17:23 "And now, O LORD, I am your servant; do as you have promised concerning me and my family. May it be a promise that will last forever.
131Ch 17:24 And may your name be established and honored forever so that everyone will say, 'The LORD of Heaven's Armies, the God of Israel, is Israel's God!' And may the house of your servant David continue before you forever.
131Ch 17:25 "O my God, I have been bold enough to pray to you because you have revealed to your servant that you will build a house for him - a dynasty of kings!
131Ch 17:26 For you are God, O LORD. And you have promised these good things to your servant.
131Ch 17:27 And now, it has pleased you to bless the house of your servant, so that it will continue forever before you. For when you grant a blessing, O LORD, it is an eternal blessing!"
131Ch 18:1 After this, David defeated and subdued the Philistines by conquering Gath and its surrounding towns.
131Ch 18:2 David also conquered the land of Moab, and the Moabites who were spared became David's subjects and paid him tribute money.
131Ch 18:3 David also destroyed the forces of Hadadezer, king of Zobah, as far as Hamath��, when Hadadezer marched out to strengthen his control along the Euphrates River. / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
131Ch 18:4 David captured 1,000 chariots, 7,000 charioteers, and 20,000 foot soldiers. He crippled all the chariot horses except enough for 100 chariots.
131Ch 18:5 When Arameans from Damascus arrived to help King Hadadezer, David killed 22,000 of them.
131Ch 18:6 Then he placed several army garrisons�� in Damascus, the Aramean capital, and the Arameans became David's subjects and paid him tribute money. So the LORD made David victorious wherever he went. / ��As in Greek version and Latin Vulgate (see also 2 Sam 8.6); Hebrew lacks several army garrisons
131Ch 18:7 David brought the gold shields of Hadadezer's officers to Jerusalem,

131Ch 18:10 he sent his son Joram�� to congratulate King David for his successful campaign. Hadadezer and Toi had been enemies and were often at war. Joram presented David with many gifts of gold, silver, and bronze. / ��As in parallel text at 2 Sam 8.10; Hebrew reads Hadoram, a variant spelling of Joram
131Ch 18:11 King David dedicated all these gifts to the LORD, along with the silver and gold he had taken from the other nations - from Edom, Moab, Ammon, Philistia, and Amalek.
131Ch 18:12 Abishai son of Zeruiah destroyed 18,000 Edomites in the Valley of Salt.
131Ch 18:13 He placed army garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became David's subjects. In fact, the LORD made David victorious wherever he went.
131Ch 18:14 So David reigned over all Israel and did what was just and right for all his people.
131Ch 18:15 Joab son of Zeruiah was commander of the army. Jehoshaphat son of Ahilud was the royal historian.
131Ch 18:16 Zadok son of Ahitub and Ahimelech�� son of Abiathar were the priests. Seraiah�� was the court secretary. / ��As in some Hebrew manuscripts, Syriac version, and Latin Vulgate (see also 2 Sam 8.17); most Hebrew manuscripts read Abimelech ��As in parallel text at 2 Sam 8.17; Hebrew reads Shavsha

131Ch 19:1 Some time after this, King Nahash of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun�� became king. / ��As in parallel text at 2 Sam 10.1; Hebrew lacks Hanun
131Ch 19:2 David said, "I am going to show loyalty to Hanun because his father, Nahash, was always loyal to me." So David sent messengers to express sympathy to Hanun about his father's death.But when David's ambassadors arrived in the land of Ammon,
131Ch 19:3 the Ammonite commanders said to Hanun, "Do you really think these men are coming here to honor your father? No! David has sent them to spy out the land so they can come in and conquer it!"
131Ch 19:4 So Hanun seized David's ambassadors and shaved them, cut off their robes at the buttocks, and sent them back to David in shame.
131Ch 19:5 When David heard what had happened to the men, he sent messengers to tell them, "Stay at Jericho until your beards grow out, and then come back." For they felt deep shame because of their appearance.
131Ch 19:6 When the people of Ammon realized how seriously they had angered David, Hanun and the Ammonites sent 75,000 pounds�� of silver to hire chariots and charioteers from Aram-naharaim, Aram-maacah, and Zobah. / ��Hebrew 1,000 talents [34,000 kilograms]
131Ch 19:7 They also hired 32,000 chariots and secured the support of the king of Maacah and his army. These forces camped at Medeba, where they were joined by the Ammonite troops that Hanun had recruited from his own towns.
131Ch 19:8 When David heard about this, he sent Joab and all his warriors to fight them.
131Ch 19:9 The Ammonite troops came out and drew up their battle lines at the entrance of the city, while the other kings positioned themselves to fight in the open fields.
131Ch 19:10 When Joab saw that he would have to fight on both the front and the rear, he chose some of Israel's elite troops and placed them under his personal command to fight the Arameans in the fields.
131Ch 19:11 He left the rest of the army under the command of his brother Abishai, who was to attack the Ammonites.
131Ch 19:12 "If the Arameans are too strong for me, then come over and help me," Joab told his brother. "And if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will help you.
131Ch 19:13 Be courageous! Let us fight bravely for our people and the cities of our God. May the LORD's will be done."
131Ch 19:14 When Joab and his troops attacked, the Arameans began to run away.
131Ch 19:15 And when the Ammonites saw the Arameans running, they also ran from Abishai and retreated into the city. Then Joab returned to Jerusalem.
131Ch 19:16 The Arameans now realized that they were no match for Israel, so they sent messengers and summoned additional Aramean troops from the other side of the Euphrates River��. These troops were under the command of Shobach��, the commander of Hadadezer's forces. / ��Hebrew the river ��As in parallel text at 2 Sam 10.16; Hebrew reads Shophach; also in 19.18
131Ch 19:17 When David heard what was happening, he mobilized all Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and positioned his troops in battle formation. Then David engaged the Arameans in battle, and they fought against him.
131Ch 19:18 But again the Arameans fled from the Israelites. This time David's forces killed 7,000 charioteers and 40,000 foot soldiers, including Shobach, the commander of their army.
131Ch 19:19 When Hadadezer's allies saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they surrendered to David and became his subjects. After that, the Arameans were no longer willing to help the Ammonites.
131Ch 20:1 In the spring of the year��, when kings normally go out to war, Joab led the Israelite army in successful attacks against the land of the Ammonites. In the process he laid siege to the city of Rabbah. However, David stayed behind in Jerusalem. / ��Hebrew At the turn of the year. The first day of the year in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in March or April
131Ch 20:2 When David arrived at Rabbah, he removed the crown from the king's head��, and it was placed on his own head. The crown was made of gold and set with gems, and he found that it weighed seventy-five pounds��. David took a vast amount of plunder from the city. / ��Or from the head of Milcom (as in Greek version and Latin Vulgate). Milcom, also called Molech, was the god of the Ammonites ��Hebrew 1 talent [34 kilograms]
131Ch 20:3 He also made slaves of the people of Rabbah and forced them to labor with saws, iron picks, and iron axes��. That is how David dealt with the people of all the Ammonite towns. Then David and all the army returned to Jerusalem. / ��As in parallel text at 2 Sam 12.31; Hebrew reads and cut them with saws, iron picks, and saws
131Ch 20:4 After this, war broke out with the Philistines at Gezer.

131Ch 20:5 During another battle with the Philistines, Elhanan son of Jair killed Lahmi, the brother of Goliath of Gath. The handle of Lahmi's spear was as thick as a weaver's beam!
131Ch 20:6 In another battle with the Philistines at Gath, they encountered a huge man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in all, who was also a descendant of the giants.
131Ch 20:7 But when he defied and taunted Israel, he was killed by Jonathan, the son of David's brother Shimea.
131Ch 20:8 These Philistines were descendants of the giants of Gath, but David and his warriors killed them.
131Ch 21:1 Satan rose up against Israel and caused David to take a census of the people of Israel.
131Ch 21:2 So David said to Joab and the commanders of the army, "Take a census of all the people of Israel - from Beersheba in the south to Dan in the north - and bring me a report so I may know how many there are."
131Ch 21:3 But Joab replied, "May the LORD increase the number of his people a hundred times over! But why, my lord the king, do you want to do this? Are they not all your servants? Why must you cause Israel to sin?"
131Ch 21:4 But the king insisted that they take the census, so Joab traveled throughout all Israel to count the people. Then he returned to Jerusalem
131Ch 21:5 and reported the number of people to David. There were 1,100,000 warriors in all Israel who could handle a sword, and 470,000 in Judah.
131Ch 21:6 But Joab did not include the tribes of Levi and Benjamin in the census because he was so distressed at what the king had made him do.
131Ch 21:7 God was very displeased with the census, and he punished Israel for it.
131Ch 21:8 Then David said to God, "I have sinned greatly by taking this census. Please forgive my guilt for doing this foolish thing."
131Ch 21:9 Then the LORD spoke to Gad, David's seer. This was the message.
131Ch 21:10 "Go and say to David, 'This is what the LORD says�� I will give you three choices. Choose one of these punishments, and I will inflict it on you.'"
131Ch 21:11 So Gad came to David and said, "These are the choices the LORD has given you.
131Ch 21:12 You may choose three years of famine, three months of destruction by the sword of your enemies, or three days of severe plague as the angel of the LORD brings devastation throughout the land of Israel. Decide what answer I should give the LORD who sent me."
131Ch 21:13 "I'm in a desperate situation!" David replied to Gad. "But let me fall into the hands of the LORD, for his mercy is very great. Do not let me fall into human hands."
131Ch 21:14 So the LORD sent a plague upon Israel, and 70,000 people died as a result.
131Ch 21:15 And God sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem. But just as the angel was preparing to destroy it, the LORD relented and said to the death angel, "Stop! That is enough!" At that moment the angel of the LORD was standing by the threshing floor of Araunah�� the Jebusite. / ��As in parallel text at 2 Sam 24.16; Hebrew reads Ornan, another name for Araunah; also in 21.18-28
131Ch 21:16 David looked up and saw the angel of the LORD standing between heaven and earth with his sword drawn, reaching out over Jerusalem. So David and the leaders of Israel put on burlap to show their deep distress and fell face down on the ground.
131Ch 21:17 And David said to God, "I am the one who called for the census! I am the one who has sinned and done wrong! But these people are as innocent as sheep - what have they done? O LORD my God, let your anger fall against me and my family, but do not destroy your people."
131Ch 21:18 Then the angel of the LORD told Gad to instruct David to go up and build an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite.
131Ch 21:19 So David went up to do what the LORD had commanded him through Gad.
131Ch 21:20 Araunah, who was busy threshing wheat at the time, turned and saw the angel there. His four sons, who were with him, ran away and hid.
131Ch 21:21 When Araunah saw David approaching, he left his threshing floor and bowed before David with his face to the ground.
131Ch 21:22 David said to Araunah, "Let me buy this threshing floor from you at its full price. Then I will build an altar to the LORD there, so that he will stop the plague."
131Ch 21:23 "Take it, my lord the king, and use it as you wish," Araunah said to David. "I will give the oxen for the burnt offerings, and the threshing boards for wood to build a fire on the altar, and the wheat for the grain offering. I will give it all to you."
131Ch 21:24 But King David replied to Araunah, "No, I insist on buying it for the full price. I will not take what is yours and give it to the LORD. I will not present burnt offerings that have cost me nothing!"
131Ch 21:25 So David gave Araunah 600 pieces of gold�� in payment for the threshing floor. / ��Hebrew 600 shekels of gold, about 15 pounds or 6.8 kilograms in weight
131Ch 21:26 David built an altar there to the LORD and sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings. And when David prayed, the LORD answered him by sending fire from heaven to burn up the offering on the altar.
131Ch 21:27 Then the LORD spoke to the angel, who put the sword back into its sheath.
131Ch 21:28 When David saw that the LORD had answered his prayer, he offered sacrifices there at Araunah's threshing floor.
131Ch 21:29 At that time the Tabernacle of the LORD and the altar of burnt offering that Moses had made in the wilderness were located at the place of worship in Gibeon.
131Ch 21:30 But David was not able to go there to inquire of God, because he was terrified by the drawn sword of the angel of the LORD.
131Ch 22:1 Then David said, "This will be the location for the Temple of the LORD God and the place of the altar for Israel's burnt offerings!"
131Ch 22:2 So David gave orders to call together the foreigners living in Israel, and he assigned them the task of preparing finished stone for building the Temple of God.
131Ch 22:3 David provided large amounts of iron for the nails that would be needed for the doors in the gates and for the clamps, and he gave more bronze than could be weighed.
131Ch 22:4 He also provided innumerable cedar logs, for the men of Tyre and Sidon had brought vast amounts of cedar to David.
131Ch 22:5 David said, "My son Solomon is still young and inexperienced. And since the Temple to be built for the LORD must be a magnificent structure, famous and glorious throughout the world, I will begin making preparations for it now." So David collected vast amounts of building materials before his death.
131Ch 22:6 Then David sent for his son Solomon and instructed him to build a Temple for the LORD, the God of Israel.
131Ch 22:7 "My son, I wanted to build a Temple to honor the name of the LORD my God," David told him.
131Ch 22:8 "But the LORD said to me, 'You have killed many men in the battles you have fought. And since you have shed so much blood in my sight, you will not be the one to build a Temple to honor my name.
131Ch 22:9 But you will have a son who will be a man of peace. I will give him peace with his enemies in all the surrounding lands. His name will be Solomon��, and I will give peace and quiet to Israel during his reign. / ��Solomon sounds like and is probably derived from the Hebrew word for "peace"
131Ch 22:10 He is the one who will build a Temple to honor my name. He will be my son, and I will be his father. And I will secure the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.'
131Ch 22:11 "Now, my son, may the LORD be with you and give you success as you follow his directions in building the Temple of the LORD your God.
131Ch 22:12 And may the LORD give you wisdom and understanding, that you may obey the Law of the LORD your God as you rule over Israel.
131Ch 22:13 For you will be successful if you carefully obey the decrees and regulations that the LORD gave to Israel through Moses. Be strong and courageous; do not be afraid or lose heart!
131Ch 22:14 "I have worked hard to provide materials for building the Temple of the LORD - nearly 4,000 tons of gold, 40,000 tons of silver��, and so much iron and bronze that it cannot be weighed. I have also gathered timber and stone for the walls, though you may need to add more. / ��Hebrew 100,000 talents [3,400 metric tons] of gold, 1,000,000 talents [34,000 metric tons] of silver
131Ch 22:15 You have a large number of skilled stonemasons and carpenters and craftsmen of every kind.
131Ch 22:16 You have expert goldsmiths and silversmiths and workers of bronze and iron. Now begin the work, and may the LORD be with you!"
131Ch 22:17 Then David ordered all the leaders of Israel to assist Solomon in this project.
131Ch 22:18 "The LORD your God is with you," he declared. "He has given you peace with the surrounding nations. He has handed them over to me, and they are now subject to the LORD and his people.
131Ch 22:19 Now seek the LORD your God with all your heart and soul. Build the sanctuary of the LORD God so that you can bring the Ark of the LORD's Covenant and the holy vessels of God into the Temple built to honor the LORD's name."
131Ch 23:1 When David was an old man, he appointed his son Solomon to be king over Israel.
131Ch 23:2 David summoned all the leaders of Israel, together with the priests and Levites.
131Ch 23:3 All the Levites who were thirty years old or older were counted, and the total came to 38,000.
131Ch 23:4 Then David said, "From all the Levites, 24,000 will supervise the work at the Temple of the LORD. Another 6,000 will serve as officials and judges.
131Ch 23:5 Another 4,000 will work as gatekeepers, and 4,000 will praise the LORD with the musical instruments I have made."
131Ch 23:6 Then David divided the Levites into divisions named after the clans descended from the three sons of Levi - Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.
131Ch 23:7 The Gershonite family units were defined by their lines of descent from Libni�� and Shimei, the sons of Gershon. / ��Hebrew Ladan (also in 23.8, 9), a variant spelling of Libni; compare 6.17
131Ch 23:8 Three of the descendants of Libni were Jehiel (the family leader), Zetham, and Joel.
131Ch 23:9 These were the leaders of the family of Libni. Three of the descendants of Shimei were Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran.
131Ch 23:10 Four other descendants of Shimei were Jahath, Ziza��, Jeush, and Beriah. / ��As in Greek version and Latin Vulgate (see also 23.11); Hebrew reads Zina
131Ch 23:11 Jahath was the family leader, and Ziza was next. Jeush and Beriah were counted as a single family because neither had many sons.
131Ch 23:12 Four of the descendants of Kohath were Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.
131Ch 23:13 The sons of Amram were Aaron and Moses. Aaron and his descendants were set apart to dedicate the most holy things, to offer sacrifices in the LORD's presence, to serve the LORD, and to pronounce blessings in his name forever.
131Ch 23:14 As for Moses, the man of God, his sons were included with the tribe of Levi.
131Ch 23:15 The sons of Moses were Gershom and Eliezer.
131Ch 23:16 The descendants of Gershom included Shebuel, the family leader.
131Ch 23:17 Eliezer had only one son, Rehabiah, the family leader. Rehabiah had numerous descendants.
131Ch 23:18 The descendants of Izhar included Shelomith, the family leader.
131Ch 23:19 The descendants of Hebron included Jeriah (the family leader), Amariah (the second), Jahaziel (the third), and Jekameam (the fourth).
131Ch 23:20 The descendants of Uzziel included Micah (the family leader) and Isshiah (the second).
131Ch 23:21 The descendants of Merari included Mahli and Mushi. The sons of Mahli were Eleazar and Kish.
131Ch 23:22 Eleazar died with no sons, only daughters. His daughters married their cousins, the sons of Kish.
131Ch 23:23 Three of the descendants of Mushi were Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth.
131Ch 23:24 These were the descendants of Levi by clans, the leaders of their family groups, registered carefully by name. Each had to be twenty years old or older to qualify for service in the house of the LORD.
131Ch 23:25 For David said, "The LORD, the God of Israel, has given us peace, and he will always live in Jerusalem.
131Ch 23:26 Now the Levites will no longer need to carry the Tabernacle and its furnishings from place to place."
131Ch 23:27 In accordance with David's final instructions, all the Levites twenty years old or older were registered for service.
131Ch 23:28 The work of the Levites was to assist the priests, the descendants of Aaron, as they served at the house of the LORD. They also took care of the courtyards and side rooms, helped perform the ceremonies of purification, and served in many other ways in the house of God.
131Ch 23:29 They were in charge of the sacred bread that was set out on the table, the choice flour for the grain offerings, the wafers made without yeast, the cakes cooked in olive oil, and the other mixed breads. They were also responsible to check all the weights and measures.
131Ch 23:30 And each morning and evening they stood before the LORD to sing songs of thanks and praise to him.
131Ch 23:31 They assisted with the burnt offerings that were presented to the LORD on Sabbath days, at new moon celebrations, and at all the appointed festivals. The required number of Levites served in the LORD's presence at all times, following all the procedures they had been given.
131Ch 23:32 And so, under the supervision of the priests, the Levites watched over the Tabernacle and the Temple�� and faithfully carried out their duties of service at the house of the LORD. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting and the sanctuary
131Ch 24:1 This is how Aaron's descendants, the priests, were divided into groups for service. The sons of Aaron were Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

131Ch 29:18 "O LORD, the God of our ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, make your people always want to obey you. See to it that their love for you never changes.
131Ch 29:19 Give my son Solomon the wholehearted desire to obey all your commands, laws, and decrees, and to do everything necessary to build this Temple, for which I have made these preparations."
131Ch 29:20 Then David said to the whole assembly, "Give praise to the LORD your God!" And the entire assembly praised the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and they bowed low and knelt before the LORD and the king.
131Ch 29:21 The next day they brought 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 male lambs as burnt offerings to the LORD. They also brought liquid offerings and many other sacrifices on behalf of all Israel.
131Ch 29:22 They feasted and drank in the LORD's presence with great joy that day.And again they crowned David's son Solomon as their new king. They anointed him before the LORD as their leader, and they anointed Zadok as priest.
131Ch 29:23 So Solomon took the throne of the LORD in place of his father, David, and he succeeded in everything, and all Israel obeyed him.
131Ch 29:24 All the officials, the warriors, and the sons of King David pledged their loyalty to King Solomon.
131Ch 29:25 And the LORD exalted Solomon in the sight of all Israel, and he gave Solomon greater royal splendor than any king in Israel before him.
131Ch 29:26 So David son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.
131Ch 29:27 He reigned over Israel for forty years, seven of them in Hebron and thirty-three in Jerusalem.
131Ch 29:28 He died at a ripe old age, having enjoyed long life, wealth, and honor. Then his son Solomon ruled in his place.
131Ch 29:29 All the events of King David's reign, from beginning to end, are written in The Record of Samuel the Seer, The Record of Nathan the Prophet, and The Record of Gad the Seer.
131Ch 29:30 These accounts include the mighty deeds of his reign and everything that happened to him and to Israel and to all the surrounding kingdoms.

142Ch 1:1 Solomon son of David took firm control of his kingdom, for the LORD his God was with him and made him very powerful.
142Ch 1:2 Solomon called together all the leaders of Israel - the generals and captains of the army��, the judges, and all the political and clan leaders. / ��Hebrew the commanders of thousands and of hundreds
142Ch 1:3 Then he led the entire assembly to the place of worship in Gibeon, for God's Tabernacle�� was located there. (This was the Tabernacle that Moses, the LORD's servant, had made in the wilderness.) / ��Hebrew Tent of Meeting; also in 1.6, 13
142Ch 1:4 David had already moved the Ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the tent he had prepared for it in Jerusalem.
142Ch 1:5 But the bronze altar made by Bezalel son of Uri and grandson of Hur was there�� at Gibeon in front of the Tabernacle of the LORD. So Solomon and the people gathered in front of it to consult the LORD��. / ��As in Greek version and Latin Vulgate, and some Hebrew manuscripts. Masoretic Text reads he placed ��Hebrew to consult him
142Ch 1:6 There in front of the Tabernacle, Solomon went up to the bronze altar in the LORD's presence and sacrificed 1,000 burnt offerings on it.
142Ch 1:7 That night God appeared to Solomon and said, "What do you want? Ask, and I will give it to you!"
142Ch 1:8 Solomon replied to God, "You showed faithful love to David, my father, and now you have made me king in his place.
142Ch 1:9 O LORD God, please continue to keep your promise to David my father, for you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth!
142Ch 1:10 Give me the wisdom and knowledge to lead them properly��, for who could possibly govern this great people of yours?" / ��Hebrew to go out and come in before this people
142Ch 1:11 God said to Solomon, "Because your greatest desire is to help your people, and you did not ask for wealth, riches, fame, or even the death of your enemies or a long life, but rather you asked for wisdom and knowledge to properly govern my people - 
142Ch 1:12 I will certainly give you the wisdom and knowledge you requested. But I will also give you wealth, riches, and fame such as no other king has had before you or will ever have in the future!"
142Ch 1:13 Then Solomon returned to Jerusalem from the Tabernacle at the place of worship in Gibeon, and he reigned over Israel.
142Ch 1:14 Solomon built up a huge force of chariots and horses��. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horses. He stationed some of them in the chariot cities and some near him in Jerusalem. / ��Or charioteers; also in 1.14b
142Ch 1:15 The king made silver and gold as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah��. / ��Hebrew the Shephelah
142Ch 1:16 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt�� and from Cilicia��; the king's traders acquired them from Cilicia at the standard price. / ��Possibly Muzur, a district near Cilicia; also in 1.17 ��Hebrew Kue, probably another name for Cilicia
142Ch 1:17 At that time chariots from Egypt could be purchased for 600 pieces of silver��, and horses for 150 pieces of silver��. They were then exported to the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Aram. / ��Hebrew 600 [shekels] of silver, about 15 pounds or 6.8 kilograms in weight ��Hebrew 150 [shekels], about 3.8 pounds or 1.7 kilograms in weight
142Ch 2:1 ��Solomon decided to build a Temple to honor the name of the LORD, and also a royal palace for himself. / ��Verse 2.1 is numbered 1.18 in Hebrew text
142Ch 2:2 ��He enlisted a force of 70,000 laborers, 80,000 men to quarry stone in the hill country, and 3,600 foremen. / ��Verses 2.2-18 are numbered 2.1-17 in Hebrew text
142Ch 2:3 Solomon also sent this message to King Hiram�� at Tyre�� "Send me cedar logs as you did for my father, David, when he was building his palace. / ��Hebrew Huram, a variant spelling of Hiram; also in 2.11
142Ch 2:4 I am about to build a Temple to honor the name of the LORD my God. It will be a place set apart to burn fragrant incense before him, to display the special sacrificial bread, and to sacrifice burnt offerings each morning and evening, on the Sabbaths, at new moon celebrations, and at the other appointed festivals of the LORD our God. He has commanded Israel to do these things forever.
142Ch 2:5 "This must be a magnificent Temple because our God is greater than all other gods.
142Ch 2:6 But who can really build him a worthy home? Not even the highest heavens can contain him! So who am I to consider building a Temple for him, except as a place to burn sacrifices to him?
142Ch 2:7 "So send me a master craftsman who can work with gold, silver, bronze, and iron, as well as with purple, scarlet, and blue cloth. He must be a skilled engraver who can work with the craftsmen of Judah and Jerusalem who were selected by my father, David.
142Ch 2:8 "Also send me cedar, cypress, and red sandalwood�� logs from Lebanon, for I know that your men are without equal at cutting timber in Lebanon. I will send my men to help them. / ��Or juniper; Hebrew reads algum, perhaps a variant spelling of almug; compare 9.10-11 and parallel text at 1 Kgs 10.11-12
142Ch 2:9 An immense amount of timber will be needed, for the Temple I am going to build will be very large and magnificent.
142Ch 2:10 In payment for your woodcutters, I will send 100,000 bushels of crushed wheat, 100,000 bushels of barley��, 110,000 gallons of wine, and 110,000 gallons of olive oil��." / ��Hebrew 20,000 cors [3,640 kiloliters] of crushed wheat, 20,000 cors of barley ��Hebrew 20,000 baths [420 kiloliters] of wine, and 20,000 baths of olive oil
142Ch 2:11 King Hiram sent this letter of reply to Solomon�� "It is because the LORD loves his people that he has made you their king!
142Ch 2:12 Praise the LORD, the God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth! He has given King David a wise son, gifted with skill and understanding, who will build a Temple for the LORD and a royal palace for himself.
142Ch 2:13 "I am sending you a master craftsman named Huram-abi, who is extremely talented.
142Ch 2:14 His mother is from the tribe of Dan in Israel, and his father is from Tyre. He is skillful at making things from gold, silver, bronze, and iron, and he also works with stone and wood. He can work with purple, blue, and scarlet cloth and fine linen. He is also an engraver and can follow any design given to him. He will work with your craftsmen and those appointed by my lord David, your father.
142Ch 2:15 "Send along the wheat, barley, olive oil, and wine that my lord has mentioned.
142Ch 2:16 We will cut whatever timber you need from the Lebanon mountains and will float the logs in rafts down the coast of the Mediterranean Sea�� to Joppa. From there you can transport the logs up to Jerusalem." / ��Hebrew the sea
142Ch 2:17 Solomon took a census of all foreigners in the land of Israel, like the census his father had taken, and he counted 153,600.
142Ch 2:18 He assigned 70,000 of them as common laborers, 80,000 as quarry workers in the hill country, and 3,600 as foremen.
142Ch 3:1 So Solomon began to build the Temple of the LORD in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah, where the LORD had appeared to David, his father. The Temple was built on the threshing floor of Araunah�� the Jebusite, the site that David had selected. / ��Hebrew reads Ornan, a variant spelling of Araunah; compare 2 Sam 24.16
142Ch 3:2 The construction began in midspring��, during the fourth year of Solomon's reign. / ��Hebrew on the second day of the second month. This day of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in April or May
142Ch 3:3 These are the dimensions Solomon used for the foundation of the Temple of God (using the old standard of measurement)��. It was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide��. / ��The "old standard of measurement" was a cubit equal to 18 inches [46 centimeters]. The new standard was a cubit of approximately 21 inches [53 centimeters] ��Hebrew 60 cubits [27.6 meters] long and 20 cubits [9.2 meters] wide
142Ch 3:4 The entry room at the front of the Temple was 30 feet�� wide, running across the entire width of the Temple, and 30 feet�� high. He overlaid the inside with pure gold. / ��Hebrew 20 cubits [9.2 meters]; also in 3.8, 11, 13 ��As in some Greek and Syriac manuscripts, which read 20 cubits [9.2 meters]; Hebrew reads 120 [cubits], which is 180 feet or 55 meters
142Ch 3:5 He paneled the main room of the Temple with cypress wood, overlaid it with fine gold, and decorated it with carvings of palm trees and chains.
142Ch 3:6 He decorated the walls of the Temple with beautiful jewels and with gold from the land of Parvaim.
142Ch 3:7 He overlaid the beams, thresholds, walls, and doors throughout the Temple with gold, and he carved figures of cherubim on the walls.
142Ch 3:8 He made the Most Holy Place 30 feet wide, corresponding to the width of the Temple, and 30 feet deep. He overlaid its interior with 23 tons�� of fine gold. / ��Hebrew 600 talents [20.4 metric tons]
142Ch 3:9 The gold nails that were used weighed 20 ounces�� each. He also overlaid the walls of the upper rooms with gold. / ��Hebrew 50 shekels [570 grams]
142Ch 3:10 He made two figures shaped like cherubim, overlaid them with gold, and placed them in the Most Holy Place.
142Ch 3:11 The total wingspan of the two cherubim standing side by side was 30 feet. One wing of the first figure was 7 1/2 feet�� long, and it touched the Temple wall. The other wing, also 7 1/2 feet long, touched one of the wings of the second figure. / ��Hebrew 5 cubits [2.3 meters]; also in 3.11b, 12, 15
142Ch 3:12 In the same way, the second figure had one wing 7 1/2 feet long that touched the opposite wall. The other wing, also 7 1/2 feet long, touched the wing of the first figure.
142Ch 3:13 So the wingspan of the two cherubim side by side was 30 feet. They stood on their feet and faced out toward the main room of the Temple.
142Ch 3:14 Across the entrance of the Most Holy Place he hung a curtain made of fine linen, decorated with blue, purple, and scarlet thread and embroidered with figures of cherubim.
142Ch 3:15 For the front of the Temple, he made two pillars that were 27 feet�� tall, each topped by a capital extending upward another 7 1/2 feet. / ��As in Syriac version (see also 1 Kgs 7.15; 2 Kgs 25.17; Jer 52.21), which reads 18 cubits [8.3 meters]; Hebrew reads 35 cubits, which is 52.5 feet or 16.5 meters
142Ch 3:16 He made a network of interwoven chains and used them to decorate the tops of the pillars. He also made 100 decorative pomegranates and attached them to the chains.
142Ch 3:17 Then he set up the two pillars at the entrance of the Temple, one to the south of the entrance and the other to the north. He named the one on the south Jakin, and the one on the north Boaz��. / ��Jakin probably means "he establishes"; Boaz probably means "in him is strength"
142Ch 4:1 Solomon�� also made a bronze altar 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 15 feet high��. / ��Or Huram-abi; Hebrew reads He ��Hebrew 20 cubits [9.2 meters] long, 20 cubits wide, and 10 cubits [4.6 meters] high
142Ch 4:2 Then he cast a great round basin, 15 feet across from rim to rim, called the Sea. It was 7 1/2 feet deep and about 45 feet in circumference��. / ��Hebrew 10 cubits [4.6 meters] across . . . 5 cubits [2.3 meters] deep and 30 cubits [13.8 meters] in circumference
142Ch 4:3 It was encircled just below its rim by two rows of figures that resembled oxen. There were about six oxen per foot�� all the way around, and they were cast as part of the basin. / ��Or 20 oxen per meter; Hebrew reads 10 per cubit
142Ch 4:4 The Sea was placed on a base of twelve bronze oxen, all facing outward. Three faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east, and the Sea rested on them.
142Ch 4:5 The walls of the Sea were about three inches�� thick, and its rim flared out like a cup and resembled a water lily blossom. It could hold about 16,500 gallons�� of water. / ��Hebrew a handbreadth [8 centimeters] ��Hebrew 3,000 baths [63 kiloliters]
142Ch 4:6 He also made ten smaller basins for washing the utensils for the burnt offerings. He set five on the south side and five on the north. But the priests washed themselves in the Sea.
142Ch 4:7 He then cast ten gold lampstands according to the specifications that had been given, and he put them in the Temple. Five were placed against the south wall, and five were placed against the north wall.
142Ch 4:8 He also built ten tables and placed them in the Temple, five along the south wall and five along the north wall. Then he molded 100 gold basins.
142Ch 4:9 He then built a courtyard for the priests, and also the large outer courtyard. He made doors for the courtyard entrances and overlaid them with bronze.
142Ch 4:10 The great bronze basin called the Sea was placed near the southeast corner of the Temple.
142Ch 4:11 Huram-abi also made the necessary washbasins, shovels, and bowls. So at last Huram-abi completed everything King Solomon had assigned him to make for the Temple of God.
142Ch 4:12 the two pillars; the two bowl-shaped capitals on top of the pillars; the two networks of interwoven chains that decorated the capitals;
142Ch 4:13 the 400 pomegranates that hung from the chains on the capitals (two rows of pomegranates for each of the chain networks that decorated the capitals on top of the pillars);
142Ch 4:14 the water carts holding the basins;
142Ch 4:15 the Sea and the twelve oxen under it;
142Ch 4:16 the ash buckets, the shovels, the meat hooks, and all the related articles. Huram-abi made all these things of burnished bronze for the Temple of the LORD, just as King Solomon had directed.
142Ch 4:17 The king had them cast in clay molds in the Jordan Valley between Succoth and Zarethan��. / ��As in parallel text at 1 Kgs 7.46; Hebrew reads Zeredah
142Ch 4:18 Solomon used such great quantities of bronze that its weight could not be determined.
142Ch 4:19 Solomon also made all the furnishings for the Temple of God�� the gold altar; the tables for the Bread of the Presence;
142Ch 4:20 the lampstands and their lamps of solid gold, to burn in front of the Most Holy Place as prescribed;
142Ch 4:21 the flower decorations, lamps, and tongs - all of the purest gold;
142Ch 4:22 the lamp snuffers, bowls, dishes, and incense burners - all of solid gold; the doors for the entrances to the Most Holy Place and the main room of the Temple, overlaid with gold.
142Ch 5:1 So Solomon finished all his work on the Temple of the LORD. Then he brought all the gifts his father, David, had dedicated - the silver, the gold, and the various articles - and he stored them in the treasuries of the Temple of God.
142Ch 5:2 Solomon then summoned to Jerusalem the elders of Israel and all the heads of tribes - the leaders of the ancestral families of Israel. They were to bring the Ark of the LORD's Covenant to the Temple from its location in the City of David, also known as Zion.
142Ch 5:3 So all the men of Israel assembled before the king at the annual Festival of Shelters, which is held in early autumn��. / ��Hebrew at the festival that is in the seventh month. The Festival of Shelters began on the fifteenth day of the seventh month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day occurred in late September, October, or early November
142Ch 5:4 When all the elders of Israel arrived, the Levites picked up the Ark.
142Ch 5:5 The priests and Levites brought up the Ark along with the special tent�� and all the sacred items that had been in it. / ��Hebrew the Tent of Meeting; i.e., the tent mentioned in 2 Sam 6.17 and 1 Chr 16.1
142Ch 5:6 There, before the Ark, King Solomon and the entire community of Israel sacrificed so many sheep, goats, and cattle that no one could keep count!
142Ch 5:7 Then the priests carried the Ark of the LORD's Covenant into the inner sanctuary of the Temple - the Most Holy Place - and placed it beneath the wings of the cherubim.
142Ch 5:8 The cherubim spread their wings over the Ark, forming a canopy over the Ark and its carrying poles.
142Ch 5:9 These poles were so long that their ends could be seen from the Temple's main room - the Holy Place�� - but not from the outside. They are still there to this day. / ��As in some Hebrew manuscripts and Greek version (see also 1 Kgs 8.8); Masoretic Text reads from the Ark in front of the Most Holy Place
142Ch 5:10 Nothing was in the Ark except the two stone tablets that Moses had placed in it at Mount Sinai��, where the LORD made a covenant with the people of Israel when they left Egypt. / ��Hebrew Horeb, another name for Sinai
142Ch 5:11 Then the priests left the Holy Place. All the priests who were present had purified themselves, whether or not they were on duty that day.
142Ch 5:12 And the Levites who were musicians - Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and all their sons and brothers - were dressed in fine linen robes and stood at the east side of the altar playing cymbals, lyres, and harps. They were joined by 120 priests who were playing trumpets.
142Ch 5:13 The trumpeters and singers performed together in unison to praise and give thanks to the LORD. Accompanied by trumpets, cymbals, and other instruments, they raised their voices and praised the LORD with these words�� "He is good! His faithful love endures forever!" At that moment a thick cloud filled the Temple of the LORD.
142Ch 5:14 The priests could not continue their service because of the cloud, for the glorious presence of the LORD filled the Temple of God.
142Ch 6:1 Then Solomon prayed, "O LORD, you have said that you would live in a thick cloud of darkness.
142Ch 6:2 Now I have built a glorious Temple for you, a place where you can live forever!"
142Ch 6:3 Then the king turned around to the entire community of Israel standing before him and gave this blessing.
142Ch 6:4 "Praise the LORD, the God of Israel, who has kept the promise he made to my father, David. For he told my father,
142Ch 6:5 'From the day I brought my people out of the land of Egypt, I have never chosen a city among any of the tribes of Israel as the place where a Temple should be built to honor my name. Nor have I chosen a king to lead my people Israel.
142Ch 6:6 But now I have chosen Jerusalem as the place for my name to be honored, and I have chosen David to be king over my people Israel.'"
142Ch 6:7 Then Solomon said, "My father, David, wanted to build this Temple to honor the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
142Ch 6:8 But the LORD told him, 'You wanted to build the Temple to honor my name. Your intention is good,
142Ch 6:9 but you are not the one to do it. One of your own sons will build the Temple to honor me.'
142Ch 6:10 "And now the LORD has fulfilled the promise he made, for I have become king in my father's place, and now I sit on the throne of Israel, just as the LORD promised. I have built this Temple to honor the name of the LORD, the God of Israel.
142Ch 6:11 There I have placed the Ark, which contains the covenant that the LORD made with the people of Israel."
142Ch 6:12 Then Solomon stood before the altar of the LORD in front of the entire community of Israel, and he lifted his hands in prayer.
142Ch 6:13 Now Solomon had made a bronze platform 7 1/2 feet long, 7 1/2 feet wide, and 4 1/2 feet high�� and had placed it at the center of the Temple's outer courtyard. He stood on the platform, and then he knelt in front of the entire community of Israel and lifted his hands toward heaven. / ��Hebrew 5 cubits [2.3 meters] long, 5 cubits wide, and 3 cubits [1.4 meters] high
142Ch 6:14 He prayed, "O LORD, God of Israel, there is no God like you in all of heaven and earth. You keep your covenant and show unfailing love to all who walk before you in wholehearted devotion.
142Ch 6:15 You have kept your promise to your servant David, my father. You made that promise with your own mouth, and with your own hands you have fulfilled it today.
142Ch 6:16 "And now, O LORD, God of Israel, carry out the additional promise you made to your servant David, my father. For you said to him, 'If your descendants guard their behavior and faithfully follow my Law as you have done, one of them will always sit on the throne of Israel.'
142Ch 6:17 Now, O LORD, God of Israel, fulfill this promise to your servant David.
142Ch 6:18 "But will God really live on earth among people? Why, even the highest heavens cannot contain you. How much less this Temple I have built!
142Ch 6:19 Nevertheless, listen to my prayer and my plea, O LORD my God. Hear the cry and the prayer that your servant is making to you.
142Ch 6:20 May you watch over this Temple day and night, this place where you have said you would put your name. May you always hear the prayers I make toward this place.
142Ch 6:21 May you hear the humble and earnest requests from me and your people Israel when we pray toward this place. Yes, hear us from heaven where you live, and when you hear, forgive.
142Ch 6:22 "If someone wrongs another person and is required to take an oath of innocence in front of your altar at this Temple,
142Ch 6:23 then hear from heaven and judge between your servants - the accuser and the accused. Pay back the guilty as they deserve. Acquit the innocent because of their innocence.
142Ch 6:24 "If your people Israel are defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against you, and if they turn back and acknowledge your name and pray to you here in this Temple,
142Ch 6:25 then hear from heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and return them to this land you gave to them and to their ancestors.
142Ch 6:26 "If the skies are shut up and there is no rain because your people have sinned against you, and if they pray toward this Temple and acknowledge your name and turn from their sins because you have punished them,
142Ch 6:27 then hear from heaven and forgive the sins of your servants, your people Israel. Teach them to follow the right path, and send rain on your land that you have given to your people as their special possession.
142Ch 6:28 "If there is a famine in the land or a plague or crop disease or attacks of locusts or caterpillars, or if your people's enemies are in the land besieging their towns - whatever disaster or disease there is - 
142Ch 6:29 and if your people Israel pray about their troubles or sorrow, raising their hands toward this Temple,
142Ch 6:30 then hear from heaven where you live, and forgive. Give your people what their actions deserve, for you alone know each human heart.
142Ch 6:31 Then they will fear you and walk in your ways as long as they live in the land you gave to our ancestors.
142Ch 6:32 "In the future, foreigners who do not belong to your people Israel will hear of you. They will come from distant lands when they hear of your great name and your strong hand and your powerful arm. And when they pray toward this Temple,
142Ch 6:33 then hear from heaven where you live, and grant what they ask of you. In this way, all the people of the earth will come to know and fear you, just as your own people Israel do. They, too, will know that this Temple I have built honors your name.
142Ch 6:34 "If your people go out where you send them to fight their enemies, and if they pray to you by turning toward this city you have chosen and toward this Temple I have built to honor your name,
142Ch 6:35 then hear their prayers from heaven and uphold their cause.
142Ch 6:36 "If they sin against you - and who has never sinned? - you might become angry with them and let their enemies conquer them and take them captive to a foreign land far away or near.
142Ch 6:37 But in that land of exile, they might turn to you in repentance and pray, 'We have sinned, done evil, and acted wickedly.'
142Ch 6:38 If they turn to you with their whole heart and soul in the land of their captivity and pray toward the land you gave to their ancestors - toward this city you have chosen, and toward this Temple I have built to honor your name - 
142Ch 6:39 then hear their prayers and their petitions from heaven where you live, and uphold their cause. Forgive your people who have sinned against you.
142Ch 6:40 "O my God, may your eyes be open and your ears attentive to all the prayers made to you in this place.
142Ch 6:41 "And now arise, O LORD God, and enter your resting place, along with the Ark, the symbol of your power. May your priests, O LORD God, be clothed with salvation; may your loyal servants rejoice in your goodness.
142Ch 6:42 O LORD God, do not reject the king you have anointed.Remember your unfailing love for your servant David."
142Ch 7:1 When Solomon finished praying, fire flashed down from heaven and burned up the burnt offerings and sacrifices, and the glorious presence of the LORD filled the Temple.
142Ch 7:2 The priests could not enter the Temple of the LORD because the glorious presence of the LORD filled it.
142Ch 7:3 When all the people of Israel saw the fire coming down and the glorious presence of the LORD filling the Temple, they fell face down on the ground and worshiped and praised the LORD, saying, "He is good! His faithful love endures forever!"
142Ch 7:4 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices to the LORD.
142Ch 7:5 King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 cattle and 120,000 sheep and goats. And so the king and all the people dedicated the Temple of God.
142Ch 7:6 The priests took their assigned positions, and so did the Levites who were singing, "His faithful love endures forever!" They accompanied the singing with music from the instruments King David had made for praising the LORD. Across from the Levites, the priests blew the trumpets, while all Israel stood.
142Ch 7:7 Solomon then consecrated the central area of the courtyard in front of the LORD's Temple. He offered burnt offerings and the fat of peace offerings there, because the bronze altar he had built could not hold all the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and sacrificial fat.
142Ch 7:8 For the next seven days Solomon and all Israel celebrated the Festival of Shelters��. A large congregation had gathered from as far away as Lebo-hamath in the north and the Brook of Egypt in the south. / ��Hebrew the festival (also in 7.9); see note on 5.3
142Ch 7:9 On the eighth day they had a closing ceremony, for they had celebrated the dedication of the altar for seven days and the Festival of Shelters for seven days.
142Ch 7:10 Then at the end of the celebration��, Solomon sent the people home. They were all joyful and glad because the LORD had been so good to David and to Solomon and to his people Israel. / ��Hebrew Then on the twenty-third day of the seventh month. This day of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in October or early November
142Ch 7:11 So Solomon finished the Temple of the LORD, as well as the royal palace. He completed everything he had planned to do in the construction of the Temple and the palace.
142Ch 7:12 Then one night the LORD appeared to Solomon and said, "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this Temple as the place for making sacrifices.
142Ch 7:13 At times I might shut up the heavens so that no rain falls, or command grasshoppers to devour your crops, or send plagues among you.
142Ch 7:14 Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land.
142Ch 7:15 My eyes will be open and my ears attentive to every prayer made in this place.
142Ch 7:16 For I have chosen this Temple and set it apart to be holy - a place where my name will be honored forever. I will always watch over it, for it is dear to my heart.
142Ch 7:17 "As for you, if you faithfully follow me as David your father did, obeying all my commands, decrees, and regulations,
142Ch 7:18 then I will establish the throne of your dynasty. For I made this covenant with your father, David, when I said, 'One of your descendants will always rule over Israel.'
142Ch 7:19 "But if you or your descendants abandon me and disobey the decrees and commands I have given you, and if you serve and worship other gods,
142Ch 7:20 then I will uproot the people from this land that I have given them. I will reject this Temple that I have made holy to honor my name. I will make it an object of mockery and ridicule among the nations.
142Ch 7:21 And though this Temple is impressive now, all who pass by will be appalled. They will ask, 'Why did the LORD do such terrible things to this land and to this Temple?'
142Ch 7:22 "And the answer will be, 'Because his people abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors, who brought them out of Egypt, and they worshiped other gods instead and bowed down to them. That is why he has brought all these disasters on them.'"
142Ch 8:1 It took Solomon twenty years to build the LORD's Temple and his own royal palace. At the end of that time,
142Ch 8:2 Solomon turned his attention to rebuilding the towns that King Hiram�� had given him, and he settled Israelites in them. / ��Hebrew Huram, a variant spelling of Hiram; also in 8.18
142Ch 8:3 Solomon also fought against the town of Hamath-zobah and conquered it.
142Ch 8:4 He rebuilt Tadmor in the wilderness and built towns in the region of Hamath as supply centers.
142Ch 8:5 He fortified the towns of Upper Beth-horon and Lower Beth-horon, rebuilding their walls and installing barred gates.
142Ch 8:6 He also rebuilt Baalath and other supply centers and constructed towns where his chariots and horses�� could be stationed. He built everything he desired in Jerusalem and Lebanon and throughout his entire realm. / ��Or and charioteers
142Ch 8:7 There were still some people living in the land who were not Israelites, including the Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites.
142Ch 8:8 These were descendants of the nations whom the people of Israel had not destroyed. So Solomon conscripted them for his labor force, and they serve in the labor force to this day.
142Ch 8:9 But Solomon did not conscript any of the Israelites for his labor force. Instead, he assigned them to serve as fighting men, officers in his army, commanders of his chariots, and charioteers.
142Ch 8:10 King Solomon appointed 250 of them to supervise the people.
142Ch 8:11 Solomon moved his wife, Pharaoh's daughter, from the City of David to the new palace he had built for her. He said, "My wife must not live in King David's palace, for the Ark of the LORD has been there, and it is holy ground."
142Ch 8:12 Then Solomon presented burnt offerings to the LORD on the altar he had built for him in front of the entry room of the Temple.
142Ch 8:13 He offered the sacrifices for the Sabbaths, the new moon festivals, and the three annual festivals - the Passover celebration, the Festival of Harvest��, and the Festival of Shelters - as Moses had commanded. / ��Or Festival of Weeks
142Ch 8:14 In assigning the priests to their duties, Solomon followed the regulations of his father, David. He also assigned the Levites to lead the people in praise and to assist the priests in their daily duties. And he assigned the gatekeepers to their gates by their divisions, following the commands of David, the man of God.
142Ch 8:15 Solomon did not deviate in any way from David's commands concerning the priests and Levites and the treasuries.
142Ch 8:16 So Solomon made sure that all the work related to building the Temple of the LORD was carried out, from the day its foundation was laid to the day of its completion.
142Ch 8:17 Later Solomon went to Ezion-geber and Elath��, ports along the shore of the Red Sea�� in the land of Edom. / ��As in Greek version (see also 2 Kgs 14.22; 16.6); Hebrew reads Eloth, a variant spelling of Elath ��As in parallel text at 1 Kgs 9.26; Hebrew reads the sea
142Ch 8:18 Hiram sent him ships commanded by his own officers and manned by experienced crews of sailors. These ships sailed to Ophir with Solomon's men and brought back to Solomon almost seventeen tons�� of gold. / ��Hebrew 450 talents [15.3 metric tons]
142Ch 9:1 When the queen of Sheba heard of Solomon's fame, she came to Jerusalem to test him with hard questions. She arrived with a large group of attendants and a great caravan of camels loaded with spices, large quantities of gold, and precious jewels. When she met with Solomon, she talked with him about everything she had on her mind.
142Ch 9:2 Solomon had answers for all her questions; nothing was too hard for him to explain to her.
142Ch 9:3 When the queen of Sheba realized how wise Solomon was, and when she saw the palace he had built,
142Ch 9:4 she was overwhelmed. She was also amazed at the food on his tables, the organization of his officials and their splendid clothing, the cup-bearers and their robes, and the burnt offerings Solomon made at the Temple of the LORD.
142Ch 9:5 She exclaimed to the king, "Everything I heard in my country about your achievements�� and wisdom is true! / ��Hebrew your words
142Ch 9:6 I didn't believe what was said until I arrived here and saw it with my own eyes. In fact, I had not heard the half of your great wisdom! It is far beyond what I was told.
142Ch 9:7 How happy your people must be! What a privilege for your officials to stand here day after day, listening to your wisdom!
142Ch 9:8 Praise the LORD your God, who delights in you and has placed you on the throne as king to rule for him. Because God loves Israel and desires this kingdom to last forever, he has made you king over them so you can rule with justice and righteousness."
142Ch 9:9 Then she gave the king a gift of 9,000 pounds�� of gold, great quantities of spices, and precious jewels. Never before had there been spices as fine as those the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. / ��Hebrew 120 talents [4,000 kilograms]
142Ch 9:10 (In addition, the crews of Hiram and Solomon brought gold from Ophir, and they also brought red sandalwood�� and precious jewels. / ��Hebrew algum wood (also in 9.11); perhaps a variant spelling of almug. Compare parallel text at 1 Kgs 10.11-12
142Ch 9:11 The king used the sandalwood to make steps�� for the Temple of the LORD and the royal palace, and to construct lyres and harps for the musicians. Never before had such beautiful things been seen in Judah.) / ��Or gateways. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
142Ch 9:12 King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba whatever she asked for - gifts of greater value than the gifts she had given him. Then she and all her attendants returned to their own land.
142Ch 9:13 Each year Solomon received about 25 tons�� of gold. / ��Hebrew 666 talents [23 metric tons]
142Ch 9:14 This did not include the additional revenue he received from merchants and traders. All the kings of Arabia and the governors of the provinces also brought gold and silver to Solomon.
142Ch 9:15 King Solomon made 200 large shields of hammered gold, each weighing more than 15 pounds��. / ��Hebrew 600 [shekels] of hammered gold [6.8 kilograms]
142Ch 9:16 He also made 300 smaller shields of hammered gold, each weighing more than 7 1/2 pounds��. The king placed these shields in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon.
142Ch 9:17 Then the king made a huge throne, decorated with ivory and overlaid with pure gold. / ��Hebrew 300 [shekels] of gold [3.4 kilograms]
142Ch 9:18 The throne had six steps, with a footstool of gold. There were armrests on both sides of the seat, and the figure of a lion stood on each side of the throne.
142Ch 9:19 There were also twelve other lions, one standing on each end of the six steps. No other throne in all the world could be compared with it!
142Ch 9:20 All of King Solomon's drinking cups were solid gold, as were all the utensils in the Palace of the Forest of Lebanon. They were not made of silver, for silver was considered worthless in Solomon's day!
142Ch 9:21 The king had a fleet of trading ships�� manned by the sailors sent by Hiram��. Once every three years the ships returned, loaded with gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks��. / ��Hebrew fleet of ships that could sail to Tarshish ��Hebrew Huram, a variant spelling of Hiram ��Or and baboons
142Ch 9:22 So King Solomon became richer and wiser than any other king on earth.
142Ch 9:23 Kings from every nation came to consult him and to hear the wisdom God had given him.
142Ch 9:24 Year after year everyone who visited brought him gifts of silver and gold, clothing, weapons, spices, horses, and mules.
142Ch 9:25 Solomon had 4,000 stalls for his horses and chariots, and he had 12,000 horses��. He stationed some of them in the chariot cities, and some near him in Jerusalem. / ��Or 12,000 charioteers
142Ch 9:26 He ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River�� in the north to the land of the Philistines and the border of Egypt in the south. / ��Hebrew the river
142Ch 9:27 The king made silver as plentiful in Jerusalem as stone. And valuable cedar timber was as common as the sycamore-fig trees that grow in the foothills of Judah��. / ��Hebrew the Shephelah
142Ch 9:28 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt�� and many other countries. / ��Possibly Muzur, a district near Cilicia
142Ch 9:29 The rest of the events of Solomon's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in The Record of Nathan the Prophet, and The Prophecy of Ahijah from Shiloh, and also in The Visions of Iddo the Seer, concerning Jeroboam son of Nebat.
142Ch 9:30 Solomon ruled in Jerusalem over all Israel for forty years.
142Ch 9:31 When he died, he was buried in the City of David, named for his father. Then his son Rehoboam became the next king.
142Ch 10:1 Rehoboam went to Shechem, where all Israel had gathered to make him king.
142Ch 10:2 When Jeroboam son of Nebat heard of this, he returned from Egypt, for he had fled to Egypt to escape from King Solomon.
142Ch 10:3 The leaders of Israel summoned him, and Jeroboam and all Israel went to speak with Rehoboam.
142Ch 10:4 "Your father was a hard master," they said. "Lighten the harsh labor demands and heavy taxes that your father imposed on us. Then we will be your loyal subjects."
142Ch 10:5 Rehoboam replied, "Come back in three days for my answer." So the people went away.
142Ch 10:6 Then King Rehoboam discussed the matter with the older men who had counseled his father, Solomon. "What is your advice?" he asked. "How should I answer these people?"
142Ch 10:7 The older counselors replied, "If you are good to these people and do your best to please them and give them a favorable answer, they will always be your loyal subjects."
142Ch 10:8 But Rehoboam rejected the advice of the older men and instead asked the opinion of the young men who had grown up with him and were now his advisers.
142Ch 10:9 "What is your advice?" he asked them. "How should I answer these people who want me to lighten the burdens imposed by my father?"
142Ch 10:10 The young men replied, "This is what you should tell those complainers who want a lighter burden�� 'My little finger is thicker than my father's waist!
142Ch 10:11 Yes, my father laid heavy burdens on you, but I'm going to make them even heavier! My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions!'"
142Ch 10:12 Three days later Jeroboam and all the people returned to hear Rehoboam's decision, just as the king had ordered.
142Ch 10:13 But Rehoboam spoke harshly to them, for he rejected the advice of the older counselors
142Ch 10:14 and followed the counsel of his younger advisers. He told the people, "My father laid�� heavy burdens on you, but I'm going to make them even heavier! My father beat you with whips, but I will beat you with scorpions!" / ��As in Greek version and many Hebrew manuscripts (see also 1 Kgs 12.14); Masoretic Text reads I will lay
142Ch 10:15 So the king paid no attention to the people. This turn of events was the will of God, for it fulfilled the LORD's message to Jeroboam son of Nebat through the prophet Ahijah from Shiloh.
142Ch 10:16 When all Israel realized�� that the king had refused to listen to them, they responded, "Down with the dynasty of David! We have no interest in the son of Jesse. Back to your homes, O Israel! Look out for your own house, O David!" So all the people of Israel returned home. / ��As in Syriac version, Latin Vulgate, and many Hebrew manuscripts (see also 1 Kgs 12.16); Masoretic Text lacks realized
142Ch 10:17 But Rehoboam continued to rule over the Israelites who lived in the towns of Judah.
142Ch 10:18 King Rehoboam sent Adoniram��, who was in charge of the labor force, to restore order, but the people of Israel stoned him to death. When this news reached King Rehoboam, he quickly jumped into his chariot and fled to Jerusalem. / ��Hebrew Hadoram, a variant spelling of Adoniram; compare 1 Kgs 4.6; 5.14; 12.18
142Ch 10:19 And to this day the northern tribes of Israel have refused to be ruled by a descendant of David.
142Ch 11:1 When Rehoboam arrived at Jerusalem, he mobilized the men of Judah and Benjamin - 180,000 select troops - to fight against Israel and to restore the kingdom to himself.
142Ch 11:2 But the LORD said to Shemaiah, the man of God,
142Ch 11:3 "Say to Rehoboam son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the Israelites in Judah and Benjamin.
142Ch 11:4 'This is what the LORD says�� Do not fight against your relatives. Go back home, for what has happened is my doing!'" So they obeyed the message of the LORD and did not fight against Jeroboam.
142Ch 11:5 Rehoboam remained in Jerusalem and fortified various towns for the defense of Judah.
142Ch 11:6 He built up Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa,
142Ch 11:7 Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam,
142Ch 11:8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph,
142Ch 11:9 Adoraim, Lachish, Azekah,
142Ch 11:10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. These became the fortified towns of Judah and Benjamin.
142Ch 11:11 Rehoboam strengthened their defenses and stationed commanders in them, and he stored supplies of food, olive oil, and wine.
142Ch 11:12 He also put shields and spears in these towns as a further safety measure. So only Judah and Benjamin remained under his control.
142Ch 11:13 But all the priests and Levites living among the northern tribes of Israel sided with Rehoboam.
142Ch 11:14 The Levites even abandoned their pasturelands and property and moved to Judah and Jerusalem, because Jeroboam and his sons would not allow them to serve the LORD as priests.
142Ch 11:15 Jeroboam appointed his own priests to serve at the pagan shrines, where they worshiped the goat and calf idols he had made.
142Ch 11:16 From all the tribes of Israel, those who sincerely wanted to worship the LORD, the God of Israel, followed the Levites to Jerusalem, where they could offer sacrifices to the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
142Ch 11:17 This strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and for three years they supported Rehoboam son of Solomon, for during those years they faithfully followed in the footsteps of David and Solomon.
142Ch 11:18 Rehoboam married his cousin Mahalath, the daughter of David's son Jerimoth and of Abihail, the daughter of Eliab son of Jesse.
142Ch 11:19 Mahalath had three sons - Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham.
142Ch 11:20 Later Rehoboam married another cousin, Maacah, the daughter of Absalom. Maacah gave birth to Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith.
142Ch 11:21 Rehoboam loved Maacah more than any of his other wives and concubines. In all, he had eighteen wives and sixty concubines, and they gave birth to twenty-eight sons and sixty daughters.
142Ch 11:22 Rehoboam appointed Maacah's son Abijah as leader among the princes, making it clear that he would be the next king.
142Ch 11:23 Rehoboam also wisely gave responsibilities to his other sons and stationed some of them in the fortified towns throughout the land of Judah and Benjamin. He provided them with generous provisions, and he found many wives for them.
142Ch 12:1 But when Rehoboam was firmly established and strong, he abandoned the Law of the LORD, and all Israel followed him in this sin.
142Ch 12:2 Because they were unfaithful to the LORD, King Shishak of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem in the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign.
142Ch 12:3 He came with 1,200 chariots, 60,000 horses��, and a countless army of foot soldiers, including Libyans, Sukkites, and Ethiopians��. / ��Or charioteers, or horsemen ��Hebrew and Cushites
142Ch 12:4 Shishak conquered Judah's fortified towns and then advanced to attack Jerusalem.
142Ch 12:5 The prophet Shemaiah then met with Rehoboam and Judah's leaders, who had all fled to Jerusalem because of Shishak. Shemaiah told them, "This is what the LORD says�� You have abandoned me, so I am abandoning you to Shishak."
142Ch 12:6 Then the leaders of Israel and the king humbled themselves and said, "The LORD is right in doing this to us!"
142Ch 12:7 When the LORD saw their change of heart, he gave this message to Shemaiah�� "Since the people have humbled themselves, I will not completely destroy them and will soon give them some relief. I will not use Shishak to pour out my anger on Jerusalem.
142Ch 12:8 But they will become his subjects, so they will know the difference between serving me and serving earthly rulers."
142Ch 12:9 So King Shishak of Egypt came up and attacked Jerusalem. He ransacked the treasuries of the LORD's Temple and the royal palace; he stole everything, including all the gold shields Solomon had made.
142Ch 12:10 King Rehoboam later replaced them with bronze shields as substitutes, and he entrusted them to the care of the commanders of the guard who protected the entrance to the royal palace.
142Ch 12:11 Whenever the king went to the Temple of the LORD, the guards would also take the shields and then return them to the guardroom.
142Ch 12:12 Because Rehoboam humbled himself, the LORD's anger was turned away, and he did not destroy him completely. There were still some good things in the land of Judah.
142Ch 12:13 King Rehoboam firmly established himself in Jerusalem and continued to rule. He was forty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city the LORD had chosen from among all the tribes of Israel as the place to honor his name. Rehoboam's mother was Naamah, a woman from Ammon.
142Ch 12:14 But he was an evil king, for he did not seek the LORD with all his heart.
142Ch 12:15 The rest of the events of Rehoboam's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in The Record of Shemaiah the Prophet and The Record of Iddo the Seer, which are part of the genealogical record. Rehoboam and Jeroboam were continually at war with each other.
142Ch 12:16 When Rehoboam died, he was buried in the City of David. Then his son Abijah became the next king.
142Ch 13:1 Abijah began to rule over Judah in the eighteenth year of Jeroboam's reign in Israel.
142Ch 13:2 He reigned in Jerusalem three years. His mother was Maacah��, the daughter of Uriel from Gibeah.Then war broke out between Abijah and Jeroboam. / ��As in most Greek manuscripts and Syriac version (see also 2 Chr 11.20-21; 1 Kgs 15.2); Hebrew reads Micaiah, a variant spelling of Maacah
142Ch 13:3 Judah, led by King Abijah, fielded 400,000 select warriors, while Jeroboam mustered 800,000 select troops from Israel.
142Ch 13:4 When the army of Judah arrived in the hill country of Ephraim, Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim and shouted to Jeroboam and all Israel�� "Listen to me!
142Ch 13:5 Don't you realize that the LORD, the God of Israel, made a lasting covenant�� with David, giving him and his descendants the throne of Israel forever? / ��Hebrew a covenant of salt
142Ch 13:6 Yet Jeroboam son of Nebat, a mere servant of David's son Solomon, rebelled against his master.
142Ch 13:7 Then a whole gang of scoundrels joined him, defying Solomon's son Rehoboam when he was young and inexperienced and could not stand up to them.
142Ch 13:8 "Do you really think you can stand against the kingdom of the LORD that is led by the descendants of David? You may have a vast army, and you have those gold calves that Jeroboam made as your gods.
142Ch 13:9 But you have chased away the priests of the LORD (the descendants of Aaron) and the Levites, and you have appointed your own priests, just like the pagan nations. You let anyone become a priest these days! Whoever comes to be dedicated with a young bull and seven rams can become a priest of these so-called gods of yours!
142Ch 13:10 "But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not abandoned him. Only the descendants of Aaron serve the LORD as priests, and the Levites alone may help them in their work.
142Ch 13:11 They present burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the LORD every morning and evening. They place the Bread of the Presence on the holy table, and they light the gold lampstand every evening. We are following the instructions of the LORD our God, but you have abandoned him.
142Ch 13:12 So you see, God is with us. He is our leader. His priests blow their trumpets and lead us into battle against you. O people of Israel, do not fight against the LORD, the God of your ancestors, for you will not succeed!"
142Ch 13:13 Meanwhile, Jeroboam had secretly sent part of his army around behind the men of Judah to ambush them.
142Ch 13:14 When Judah realized that they were being attacked from the front and the rear, they cried out to the LORD for help. Then the priests blew the trumpets,
142Ch 13:15 and the men of Judah began to shout. At the sound of their battle cry, God defeated Jeroboam and all Israel and routed them before Abijah and the army of Judah.
142Ch 13:16 The Israelite army fled from Judah, and God handed them over to Judah in defeat.
142Ch 13:17 Abijah and his army inflicted heavy losses on them; 500,000 of Israel's select troops were killed that day.
142Ch 13:18 So Judah defeated Israel on that occasion because they trusted in the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
142Ch 13:19 Abijah and his army pursued Jeroboam's troops and captured some of his towns, including Bethel, Jeshanah, and Ephron, along with their surrounding villages.
142Ch 13:20 So Jeroboam of Israel never regained his power during Abijah's lifetime, and finally the LORD struck him down and he died.
142Ch 13:21 Meanwhile, Abijah of Judah grew more and more powerful. He married fourteen wives and had twenty-two sons and sixteen daughters.
142Ch 13:22 The rest of the events of Abijah's reign, including his words and deeds, are recorded in The Commentary of Iddo the Prophet.
142Ch 14:1 ��When Abijah died, he was buried in the City of David. Then his son Asa became the next king. There was peace in the land for ten years. / ��Verse 14.1 is numbered 13.23 in the Hebrew text
142Ch 14:2 ��Asa did what was pleasing and good in the sight of the LORD his God. / ��Verses 14.2-15 are numbered 14.1-14 in Hebrew text
142Ch 14:3 He removed the foreign altars and the pagan shrines. He smashed the sacred pillars and cut down the Asherah poles.
142Ch 14:4 He commanded the people of Judah to seek the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and to obey his law and his commands.
142Ch 14:5 Asa also removed the pagan shrines, as well as the incense altars from every one of Judah's towns. So Asa's kingdom enjoyed a period of peace.
142Ch 14:6 During those peaceful years, he was able to build up the fortified towns throughout Judah. No one tried to make war against him at this time, for the LORD was giving him rest from his enemies.
142Ch 14:7 Asa told the people of Judah, "Let us build towns and fortify them with walls, towers, gates, and bars. The land is still ours because we sought the LORD our God, and he has given us peace on every side." So they went ahead with these projects and brought them to completion.
142Ch 14:8 King Asa had an army of 300,000 warriors from the tribe of Judah, armed with large shields and spears. He also had an army of 280,000 warriors from the tribe of Benjamin, armed with small shields and bows. Both armies were composed of well-trained fighting men.
142Ch 14:9 Once an Ethiopian�� named Zerah attacked Judah with an army of 1,000,000 men�� and 300 chariots. They advanced to the town of Mareshah, / ��Hebrew a Cushite ��Or an army of thousands and thousands; Hebrew reads an army of a thousand thousands
142Ch 14:10 so Asa deployed his armies for battle in the valley north of Mareshah��. / ��Or in the Zephathah Valley near Mareshah
142Ch 14:11 Then Asa cried out to the LORD his God, "O LORD, no one but you can help the powerless against the mighty! Help us, O LORD our God, for we trust in you alone. It is in your name that we have come against this vast horde. O LORD, you are our God; do not let mere men prevail against you!"
142Ch 14:12 So the LORD defeated the Ethiopians�� in the presence of Asa and the army of Judah, and the enemy fled. / ��Hebrew Cushites; also in 14.13
142Ch 14:13 Asa and his army pursued them as far as Gerar, and so many Ethiopians fell that they were unable to rally. They were destroyed by the LORD and his army, and the army of Judah carried off a vast amount of plunder.
142Ch 14:14 While they were at Gerar, they attacked all the towns in that area, and terror from the LORD came upon the people there. As a result, a vast amount of plunder was taken from these towns, too.
142Ch 14:15 They also attacked the camps of herdsmen and captured many sheep, goats, and camels before finally returning to Jerusalem.
142Ch 15:1 Then the Spirit of God came upon Azariah son of Oded,
142Ch 15:2 and he went out to meet King Asa as he was returning from the battle. "Listen to me, Asa!" he shouted. "Listen, all you people of Judah and Benjamin! The LORD will stay with you as long as you stay with him! Whenever you seek him, you will find him. But if you abandon him, he will abandon you.
142Ch 15:3 For a long time Israel was without the true God, without a priest to teach them, and without the Law to instruct them.
142Ch 15:4 But whenever they were in trouble and turned to the LORD, the God of Israel, and sought him out, they found him.
142Ch 15:5 "During those dark times, it was not safe to travel. Problems troubled the people of every land.
142Ch 15:6 Nation fought against nation, and city against city, for God was troubling them with every kind of problem.
142Ch 15:7 But as for you, be strong and courageous, for your work will be rewarded."
142Ch 15:8 When Asa heard this message from Azariah the prophet��, he took courage and removed all the detestable idols from the land of Judah and Benjamin and in the towns he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. And he repaired the altar of the LORD, which stood in front of the entry room of the LORD's Temple. / ��As in Syriac version and Latin Vulgate (see also 15.1); Hebrew reads from Oded the prophet
142Ch 15:9 Then Asa called together all the people of Judah and Benjamin, along with the people of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who had settled among them. For many from Israel had moved to Judah during Asa's reign when they saw that the LORD his God was with him.
142Ch 15:10 The people gathered at Jerusalem in late spring��, during the fifteenth year of Asa's reign. / ��Hebrew in the third month. This month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of May and June
142Ch 15:11 On that day they sacrificed to the LORD 700 cattle and 7,000 sheep and goats from the plunder they had taken in the battle.
142Ch 15:12 Then they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD, the God of their ancestors, with all their heart and soul.
142Ch 15:13 They agreed that anyone who refused to seek the LORD, the God of Israel, would be put to death - whether young or old, man or woman.
142Ch 15:14 They shouted out their oath of loyalty to the LORD with trumpets blaring and rams' horns sounding.
142Ch 15:15 All in Judah were happy about this covenant, for they had entered into it with all their heart. They earnestly sought after God, and they found him. And the LORD gave them rest from their enemies on every side.
142Ch 15:16 King Asa even deposed his grandmother�� Maacah from her position as queen mother because she had made an obscene Asherah pole. He cut down her obscene pole, broke it up, and burned it in the Kidron Valley. / ��Hebrew his mother
142Ch 15:17 Although the pagan shrines were not removed from Israel, Asa's heart remained completely faithful throughout his life.
142Ch 15:18 He brought into the Temple of God the silver and gold and the various items that he and his father had dedicated.
142Ch 15:19 So there was no more war until the thirty-fifth year of Asa's reign.
142Ch 16:1 In the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign, King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and fortified Ramah in order to prevent anyone from entering or leaving King Asa's territory in Judah.
142Ch 16:2 Asa responded by removing the silver and gold from the treasuries of the Temple of the LORD and the royal palace. He sent it to King Ben-hadad of Aram, who was ruling in Damascus, along with this message.
142Ch 16:3 "Let there be a treaty�� between you and me like the one between your father and my father. See, I am sending you silver and gold. Break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel so that he will leave me alone." / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew reads There is a treaty
142Ch 16:4 Ben-hadad agreed to King Asa's request and sent the commanders of his army to attack the towns of Israel. They conquered the towns of Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah��, and all the store cities in Naphtali. / ��As in parallel text at 1 Kgs 15.20; Hebrew reads Abel-maim, another name for Abel-beth-maacah
142Ch 16:5 As soon as Baasha of Israel heard what was happening, he abandoned his project of fortifying Ramah and stopped all work on it.
142Ch 16:6 Then King Asa called out all the men of Judah to carry away the building stones and timbers that Baasha had been using to fortify Ramah. Asa used these materials to fortify the towns of Geba and Mizpah.
142Ch 16:7 At that time Hanani the seer came to King Asa and told him, "Because you have put your trust in the king of Aram instead of in the LORD your God, you missed your chance to destroy the army of the king of Aram.
142Ch 16:8 Don't you remember what happened to the Ethiopians�� and Libyans and their vast army, with all of their chariots and charioteers?�� At that time you relied on the LORD, and he handed them over to you. / ��Hebrew Cushites ��Or and horsemen?
142Ch 16:9 The eyes of the LORD search the whole earth in order to strengthen those whose hearts are fully committed to him. What a fool you have been! From now on you will be at war."
142Ch 16:10 Asa became so angry with Hanani for saying this that he threw him into prison and put him in stocks. At that time Asa also began to oppress some of his people.
142Ch 16:11 The rest of the events of Asa's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 16:12 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa developed a serious foot disease. Yet even with the severity of his disease, he did not seek the LORD's help but turned only to his physicians.
142Ch 16:13 So he died in the forty-first year of his reign.
142Ch 16:14 He was buried in the tomb he had carved out for himself in the City of David. He was laid on a bed perfumed with sweet spices and fragrant ointments, and the people built a huge funeral fire in his honor.
142Ch 17:1 Then Jehoshaphat, Asa's son, became the next king. He strengthened Judah to stand against any attack from Israel.
142Ch 17:2 He stationed troops in all the fortified towns of Judah, and he assigned additional garrisons to the land of Judah and to the towns of Ephraim that his father, Asa, had captured.
142Ch 17:3 The LORD was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the example of his father's early years�� and did not worship the images of Baal. / ��Some Hebrew manuscripts read the example of his father, David
142Ch 17:4 He sought his father's God and obeyed his commands instead of following the evil practices of the kingdom of Israel.
142Ch 17:5 So the LORD established Jehoshaphat's control over the kingdom of Judah. All the people of Judah brought gifts to Jehoshaphat, so he became very wealthy and highly esteemed.
142Ch 17:6 He was deeply committed to�� the ways of the LORD. He removed the pagan shrines and Asherah poles from Judah. / ��Hebrew His heart was courageous in
142Ch 17:7 In the third year of his reign Jehoshaphat sent his officials to teach in all the towns of Judah. These officials included Ben-hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah.
142Ch 17:8 He sent Levites along with them, including Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Asahel, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tob-adonijah. He also sent out the priests Elishama and Jehoram.
142Ch 17:9 They took copies of the Book of the Law of the LORD and traveled around through all the towns of Judah, teaching the people.
142Ch 17:10 Then the fear of the LORD fell over all the surrounding kingdoms so that none of them wanted to declare war on Jehoshaphat.
142Ch 17:11 Some of the Philistines brought him gifts and silver as tribute, and the Arabs brought 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats.
142Ch 17:12 So Jehoshaphat became more and more powerful and built fortresses and storage cities throughout Judah.
142Ch 17:13 He stored numerous supplies in Judah's towns and stationed an army of seasoned troops at Jerusalem.
142Ch 17:14 His army was enrolled according to ancestral clans. From Judah there were 300,000 troops organized in units of 1,000, under the command of Adnah.
142Ch 17:15 Next in command was Jehohanan, who commanded 280,000 troops.
142Ch 17:16 Next was Amasiah son of Zicri, who volunteered for the LORD's service, with 200,000 troops under his command.
142Ch 17:17 From Benjamin there were 200,000 troops equipped with bows and shields. They were under the command of Eliada, a veteran soldier.
142Ch 17:18 Next in command was Jehozabad, who commanded 180,000 armed men.
142Ch 17:19 These were the troops stationed in Jerusalem to serve the king, besides those Jehoshaphat stationed in the fortified towns throughout Judah.
142Ch 18:1 Jehoshaphat enjoyed great riches and high esteem, and he made an alliance with Ahab of Israel by having his son marry Ahab's daughter.
142Ch 18:2 A few years later he went to Samaria to visit Ahab, who prepared a great banquet for him and his officials. They butchered great numbers of sheep, goats, and cattle for the feast. Then Ahab enticed Jehoshaphat to join forces with him to recover Ramoth-gilead.
142Ch 18:3 "Will you go with me to Ramoth-gilead?" King Ahab of Israel asked King Jehoshaphat of Judah.Jehoshaphat replied, "Why, of course! You and I are as one, and my troops are your troops. We will certainly join you in battle."
142Ch 18:4 Then Jehoshaphat added, "But first let's find out what the LORD says."
142Ch 18:5 So the king of Israel summoned the prophets, 400 of them, and asked them, "Should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold back?" They all replied, "Yes, go right ahead! God will give the king victory."
142Ch 18:6 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Is there not also a prophet of the LORD here? We should ask him the same question."
142Ch 18:7 The king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat, "There is one more man who could consult the LORD for us, but I hate him. He never prophesies anything but trouble for me! His name is Micaiah son of Imlah." Jehoshaphat replied, "That's not the way a king should talk! Let's hear what he has to say."
142Ch 18:8 So the king of Israel called one of his officials and said, "Quick! Bring Micaiah son of Imlah."
142Ch 18:9 King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah, dressed in their royal robes, were sitting on thrones at the threshing floor near the gate of Samaria. All of Ahab's prophets were prophesying there in front of them.
142Ch 18:10 One of them, Zedekiah son of Kenaanah, made some iron horns and proclaimed, "This is what the LORD says�� With these horns you will gore the Arameans to death!"
142Ch 18:11 All the other prophets agreed. "Yes," they said, "go up to Ramoth-gilead and be victorious, for the LORD will give the king victory!"
142Ch 18:12 Meanwhile, the messenger who went to get Micaiah said to him, "Look, all the prophets are promising victory for the king. Be sure that you agree with them and promise success."
142Ch 18:13 But Micaiah replied, "As surely as the LORD lives, I will say only what my God says."
142Ch 18:14 When Micaiah arrived before the king, Ahab asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I hold back?" Micaiah replied sarcastically, "Yes, go up and be victorious, for you will have victory over them!"
142Ch 18:15 But the king replied sharply, "How many times must I demand that you speak only the truth to me when you speak for the LORD?"
142Ch 18:16 Then Micaiah told him, "In a vision I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, like sheep without a shepherd. And the LORD said, 'Their master has been killed��. Send them home in peace.'" / ��Hebrew These people have no master
142Ch 18:17 "Didn't I tell you?" the king of Israel exclaimed to Jehoshaphat. "He never prophesies anything but trouble for me."
142Ch 18:18 Then Micaiah continued, "Listen to what the LORD says! I saw the LORD sitting on his throne with all the armies of heaven around him, on his right and on his left.
142Ch 18:19 And the LORD said, 'Who can entice King Ahab of Israel to go into battle against Ramoth-gilead so he can be killed?' "There were many suggestions,
142Ch 18:20 and finally a spirit approached the LORD and said, 'I can do it!' "'How will you do this?' the LORD asked.
142Ch 18:21 "And the spirit replied, 'I will go out and inspire all of Ahab's prophets to speak lies.' "'You will succeed,' said the LORD. 'Go ahead and do it.'
142Ch 18:22 "So you see, the LORD has put a lying spirit in the mouths of your prophets. For the LORD has pronounced your doom."
142Ch 18:23 Then Zedekiah son of Kenaanah walked up to Micaiah and slapped him across the face. "Since when did the Spirit of the LORD leave me to speak to you?" he demanded.
142Ch 18:24 And Micaiah replied, "You will find out soon enough when you are trying to hide in some secret room!"
142Ch 18:25 "Arrest him!" the king of Israel ordered. "Take him back to Amon, the governor of the city, and to my son Joash.
142Ch 18:26 Give them this order from the king�� 'Put this man in prison, and feed him nothing but bread and water until I return safely from the battle!'"
142Ch 18:27 But Micaiah replied, "If you return safely, it will mean that the LORD has not spoken through me!" Then he added to those standing around, "Everyone mark my words!"
142Ch 18:28 So King Ahab of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah led their armies against Ramoth-gilead.
142Ch 18:29 The king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, "As we go into battle, I will disguise myself so no one will recognize me, but you wear your royal robes." So the king of Israel disguised himself, and they went into battle.
142Ch 18:30 Meanwhile, the king of Aram had issued these orders to his chariot commanders�� "Attack only the king of Israel! Don't bother with anyone else."
142Ch 18:31 So when the Aramean chariot commanders saw Jehoshaphat in his royal robes, they went after him. "There is the king of Israel!" they shouted. But Jehoshaphat called out, and the LORD saved him. God helped him by turning the attackers away from him.
142Ch 18:32 As soon as the chariot commanders realized he was not the king of Israel, they stopped chasing him.
142Ch 18:33 An Aramean soldier, however, randomly shot an arrow at the Israelite troops and hit the king of Israel between the joints of his armor. "Turn the horses�� and get me out of here!" Ahab groaned to the driver of the chariot. "I'm badly wounded!" / ��Hebrew Turn your hand
142Ch 18:34 The battle raged all that day, and the king of Israel propped himself up in his chariot facing the Arameans. In the evening, just as the sun was setting, he died.
142Ch 19:1 When King Jehoshaphat of Judah arrived safely home in Jerusalem,
142Ch 19:2 Jehu son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him. "Why should you help the wicked and love those who hate the LORD?" he asked the king. "Because of what you have done, the LORD is very angry with you.
142Ch 19:3 Even so, there is some good in you, for you have removed the Asherah poles throughout the land, and you have committed yourself to seeking God."
142Ch 19:4 Jehoshaphat lived in Jerusalem, but he went out among the people, traveling from Beersheba to the hill country of Ephraim, encouraging the people to return to the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
142Ch 19:5 He appointed judges throughout the nation in all the fortified towns,
142Ch 19:6 and he said to them, "Always think carefully before pronouncing judgment. Remember that you do not judge to please people but to please the LORD. He will be with you when you render the verdict in each case.
142Ch 19:7 Fear the LORD and judge with integrity, for the LORD our God does not tolerate perverted justice, partiality, or the taking of bribes."
142Ch 19:8 In Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat appointed some of the Levites and priests and clan leaders in Israel to serve as judges for cases involving the LORD's regulations and for civil disputes.
142Ch 19:9 These were his instructions to them�� "You must always act in the fear of the LORD, with faithfulness and an undivided heart.
142Ch 19:10 Whenever a case comes to you from fellow citizens in an outlying town, whether a murder case or some other violation of God's laws, commands, decrees, or regulations, you must warn them not to sin against the LORD, so that he will not be angry with you and them. Do this and you will not be guilty.
142Ch 19:11 "Amariah the high priest will have final say in all cases involving the LORD. Zebadiah son of Ishmael, a leader from the tribe of Judah, will have final say in all civil cases. The Levites will assist you in making sure that justice is served. Take courage as you fulfill your duties, and may the LORD be with those who do what is right."
142Ch 20:1 After this, the armies of the Moabites, Ammonites, and some of the Meunites�� declared war on Jehoshaphat. / ��As in some Greek manuscripts (see also 26.7); Hebrew repeats Ammonites
142Ch 20:2 Messengers came and told Jehoshaphat, "A vast army from Edom�� is marching against you from beyond the Dead Sea��. They are already at Hazazon-tamar." (This was another name for En-gedi.) / ��As in one Hebrew manuscript; most Hebrew manuscripts and ancient versions read Aram ��Hebrew the sea
142Ch 20:3 Jehoshaphat was terrified by this news and begged the LORD for guidance. He also ordered everyone in Judah to begin fasting.
142Ch 20:4 So people from all the towns of Judah came to Jerusalem to seek the LORD's help.
142Ch 20:5 Jehoshaphat stood before the community of Judah and Jerusalem in front of the new courtyard at the Temple of the LORD.
142Ch 20:6 He prayed, "O LORD, God of our ancestors, you alone are the God who is in heaven. You are ruler of all the kingdoms of the earth. You are powerful and mighty; no one can stand against you!
142Ch 20:7 O our God, did you not drive out those who lived in this land when your people Israel arrived? And did you not give this land forever to the descendants of your friend Abraham?
142Ch 20:8 Your people settled here and built this Temple to honor your name.
142Ch 20:9 They said, 'Whenever we are faced with any calamity such as war��, plague, or famine, we can come to stand in your presence before this Temple where your name is honored. We can cry out to you to save us, and you will hear us and rescue us.' / ��Or sword of judgment; or sword, judgment
142Ch 20:10 "And now see what the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir are doing. You would not let our ancestors invade those nations when Israel left Egypt, so they went around them and did not destroy them.
142Ch 20:11 Now see how they reward us! For they have come to throw us out of your land, which you gave us as an inheritance.
142Ch 20:12 O our God, won't you stop them? We are powerless against this mighty army that is about to attack us. We do not know what to do, but we are looking to you for help."
142Ch 20:13 As all the men of Judah stood before the LORD with their little ones, wives, and children,
142Ch 20:14 the Spirit of the LORD came upon one of the men standing there. His name was Jahaziel son of Zechariah, son of Benaiah, son of Jeiel, son of Mattaniah, a Levite who was a descendant of Asaph.
142Ch 20:15 He said, "Listen, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Listen, King Jehoshaphat! This is what the LORD says�� Do not be afraid! Don't be discouraged by this mighty army, for the battle is not yours, but God's.
142Ch 20:16 Tomorrow, march out against them. You will find them coming up through the ascent of Ziz at the end of the valley that opens into the wilderness of Jeruel.
142Ch 20:17 But you will not even need to fight. Take your positions; then stand still and watch the LORD's victory. He is with you, O people of Judah and Jerusalem. Do not be afraid or discouraged. Go out against them tomorrow, for the LORD is with you!"
142Ch 20:18 Then King Jehoshaphat bowed low with his face to the ground. And all the people of Judah and Jerusalem did the same, worshiping the LORD.
142Ch 20:19 Then the Levites from the clans of Kohath and Korah stood to praise the LORD, the God of Israel, with a very loud shout.
142Ch 20:20 Early the next morning the army of Judah went out into the wilderness of Tekoa. On the way Jehoshaphat stopped and said, "Listen to me, all you people of Judah and Jerusalem! Believe in the LORD your God, and you will be able to stand firm. Believe in his prophets, and you will succeed."
142Ch 20:21 After consulting the people, the king appointed singers to walk ahead of the army, singing to the LORD and praising him for his holy splendor. This is what they sang�� "Give thanks to the LORD; his faithful love endures forever!"
142Ch 20:22 At the very moment they began to sing and give praise, the LORD caused the armies of Ammon, Moab, and Mount Seir to start fighting among themselves.
142Ch 20:23 The armies of Moab and Ammon turned against their allies from Mount Seir and killed every one of them. After they had destroyed the army of Seir, they began attacking each other.
142Ch 20:24 So when the army of Judah arrived at the lookout point in the wilderness, all they saw were dead bodies lying on the ground as far as they could see. Not a single one of the enemy had escaped.
142Ch 20:25 King Jehoshaphat and his men went out to gather the plunder. They found vast amounts of equipment, clothing��, and other valuables - more than they could carry. There was so much plunder that it took them three days just to collect it all! / ��As in some Hebrew manuscripts and Latin Vulgate; most Hebrew manuscripts read corpses
142Ch 20:26 On the fourth day they gathered in the Valley of Blessing��, which got its name that day because the people praised and thanked the LORD there. It is still called the Valley of Blessing today. / ��Hebrew valley of Beracah
142Ch 20:27 Then all the men returned to Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat leading them, overjoyed that the LORD had given them victory over their enemies.
142Ch 20:28 They marched into Jerusalem to the music of harps, lyres, and trumpets, and they proceeded to the Temple of the LORD.
142Ch 20:29 When all the surrounding kingdoms heard that the LORD himself had fought against the enemies of Israel, the fear of God came over them.
142Ch 20:30 So Jehoshaphat's kingdom was at peace, for his God had given him rest on every side.
142Ch 20:31 So Jehoshaphat ruled over the land of Judah. He was thirty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-five years. His mother was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi.
142Ch 20:32 Jehoshaphat was a good king, following the ways of his father, Asa. He did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight.
142Ch 20:33 During his reign, however, he failed to remove all the pagan shrines, and the people never fully committed themselves to follow the God of their ancestors.
142Ch 20:34 The rest of the events of Jehoshaphat's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in The Record of Jehu Son of Hanani, which is included in The Book of the Kings of Israel.
142Ch 20:35 Some time later King Jehoshaphat of Judah made an alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel, who was very wicked��. / ��Or who made him do what was wicked
142Ch 20:36 Together they built a fleet of trading ships�� at the port of Ezion-geber. / ��Hebrew fleet of ships that could go to Tarshish
142Ch 20:37 Then Eliezer son of Dodavahu from Mareshah prophesied against Jehoshaphat. He said, "Because you have allied yourself with King Ahaziah, the LORD will destroy your work." So the ships met with disaster and never put out to sea��. / ��Hebrew never set sail for Tarshish
142Ch 21:1 When Jehoshaphat died, he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David. Then his son Jehoram became the next king.
142Ch 21:2 Jehoram's brothers - the other sons of Jehoshaphat - were Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariahu, Michael, and Shephatiah; all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of Judah��. / ��Masoretic Text reads of Israel; also in 21.4. The author of Chronicles sees Judah as representative of the true Israel. (Some Hebrew manuscripts, Greek and Syriac versions, and Latin Vulgate read of Judah.)
142Ch 21:3 Their father had given each of them valuable gifts of silver, gold, and costly items, and also some of Judah's fortified towns. However, he designated Jehoram as the next king because he was the oldest.
142Ch 21:4 But when Jehoram had become solidly established as king, he killed all his brothers and some of the other leaders of Judah.
142Ch 21:5 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years.
142Ch 21:6 But Jehoram followed the example of the kings of Israel and was as wicked as King Ahab, for he had married one of Ahab's daughters. So Jehoram did what was evil in the LORD's sight.
142Ch 21:7 But the LORD did not want to destroy David's dynasty, for he had made a covenant with David and promised that his descendants would continue to rule, shining like a lamp forever.
142Ch 21:8 During Jehoram's reign, the Edomites revolted against Judah and crowned their own king.
142Ch 21:9 So Jehoram went out with his full army and all his chariots. The Edomites surrounded him and his chariot commanders, but he went out at night and attacked them�� under cover of darkness. / ��Or he went out and escaped. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
142Ch 21:10 Even so, Edom has been independent from Judah to this day. The town of Libnah also revolted about that same time. All this happened because Jehoram had abandoned the LORD, the God of his ancestors.
142Ch 21:11 He had built pagan shrines in the hill country of Judah and had led the people of Jerusalem and Judah to give themselves to pagan gods and to go astray.
142Ch 21:12 Then Elijah the prophet wrote Jehoram this letter�� "This is what the LORD, the God of your ancestor David, says�� You have not followed the good example of your father, Jehoshaphat, or your grandfather King Asa of Judah.
142Ch 21:13 Instead, you have been as evil as the kings of Israel. You have led the people of Jerusalem and Judah to worship idols, just as King Ahab did in Israel. And you have even killed your own brothers, men who were better than you.
142Ch 21:14 So now the LORD is about to strike you, your people, your children, your wives, and all that is yours with a heavy blow.
142Ch 21:15 You yourself will suffer with a severe intestinal disease that will get worse each day until your bowels come out."
142Ch 21:16 Then the LORD stirred up the Philistines and the Arabs, who lived near the Ethiopians��, to attack Jehoram. / ��Hebrew the Cushites
142Ch 21:17 They marched against Judah, broke down its defenses, and carried away everything of value in the royal palace, including the king's sons and his wives. Only his youngest son, Ahaziah��, was spared. / ��Hebrew Jehoahaz, a variant spelling of Ahaziah; compare 22.1
142Ch 21:18 After all this, the LORD struck Jehoram with the severe intestinal disease.
142Ch 21:19 The disease grew worse and worse, and at the end of two years it caused his bowels to come out, and he died in agony. His people did not build a great funeral fire to honor him as they had done for his ancestors.
142Ch 21:20 Jehoram was thirty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eight years. No one was sorry when he died. They buried him in the City of David, but not in the royal cemetery.
142Ch 22:1 Then the people of Jerusalem made Ahaziah, Jehoram's youngest son, their next king, since the marauding bands who came with the Arabs�� had killed all the older sons. So Ahaziah son of Jehoram reigned as king of Judah. / ��Or marauding bands of Arabs
142Ch 22:2 Ahaziah was twenty-two�� years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem one year. His mother was Athaliah, a granddaughter of King Omri. / ��As in some Greek manuscripts and Syriac version (see also 2 Kgs 8.26); Hebrew reads forty-two
142Ch 22:3 Ahaziah also followed the evil example of King Ahab's family, for his mother encouraged him in doing wrong.
142Ch 22:4 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, just as Ahab's family had done. They even became his advisers after the death of his father, and they led him to ruin.
142Ch 22:5 Following their evil advice, Ahaziah joined King Joram��, the son of King Ahab of Israel, in his war against King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. When the Arameans wounded Joram in the battle, / ��Hebrew Jehoram, a variant spelling of Joram; also in 22.6, 7
142Ch 22:6 he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds he had received at Ramoth��. Because Joram was wounded, King Ahaziah�� of Judah went to Jezreel to visit him. / ��Hebrew Ramah, a variant spelling of Ramoth ��As in some Hebrew manuscripts, Greek and Syriac versions, and Latin Vulgate (see also 2 Kgs 8.29); most Hebrew manuscripts read Azariah
142Ch 22:7 But God had decided that this visit would be Ahaziah's downfall. While he was there, Ahaziah went out with Joram to meet Jehu grandson of Nimshi��, whom the LORD had appointed to destroy the dynasty of Ahab. / ��Hebrew descendant of Nimshi; compare 2 Kgs 9.2, 14
142Ch 22:8 While Jehu was executing judgment against the family of Ahab, he happened to meet some of Judah's officials and Ahaziah's relatives�� who were traveling with Ahaziah. So Jehu killed them all. / ��As in Greek version (see also 2 Kgs 10.13); Hebrew reads and sons of the brothers of Ahaziah
142Ch 22:9 Then Jehu's men searched for Ahaziah, and they found him hiding in the city of Samaria. They brought him to Jehu, who killed him. Ahaziah was given a decent burial because the people said, "He was the grandson of Jehoshaphat - a man who sought the LORD with all his heart." But none of the surviving members of Ahaziah's family was capable of ruling the kingdom.
142Ch 22:10 When Athaliah, the mother of King Ahaziah of Judah, learned that her son was dead, she began to destroy the rest of Judah's royal family.
142Ch 22:11 But Ahaziah's sister Jehosheba��, the daughter of King Jehoram, took Ahaziah's infant son, Joash, and stole him away from among the rest of the king's children, who were about to be killed. She put Joash and his nurse in a bedroom. In this way, Jehosheba, wife of Jehoiada the priest and sister of Ahaziah, hid the child so that Athaliah could not murder him. / ��As in parallel text at 2 Kgs 11.2; Hebrew lacks Ahaziah's sister and reads Jehoshabeath [a variant spelling of Jehosheba]
142Ch 22:12 Joash remained hidden in the Temple of God for six years while Athaliah ruled over the land.
142Ch 23:1 In the seventh year of Athaliah's reign, Jehoiada the priest decided to act. He summoned his courage and made a pact with five army commanders�� Azariah son of Jeroham, Ishmael son of Jehohanan, Azariah son of Obed, Maaseiah son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat son of Zicri.
142Ch 23:2 These men traveled secretly throughout Judah and summoned the Levites and clan leaders in all the towns to come to Jerusalem.
142Ch 23:3 They all gathered at the Temple of God, where they made a solemn pact with Joash, the young king.Jehoiada said to them, "Here is the king's son! The time has come for him to reign! The LORD has promised that a descendant of David will be our king.
142Ch 23:4 This is what you must do. When you priests and Levites come on duty on the Sabbath, a third of you will serve as gatekeepers.
142Ch 23:5 Another third will go over to the royal palace, and the final third will be at the Foundation Gate. Everyone else should stay in the courtyards of the LORD's Temple.
142Ch 23:6 Remember, only the priests and Levites on duty may enter the Temple of the LORD, for they are set apart as holy. The rest of the people must obey the LORD's instructions and stay outside.
142Ch 23:7 You Levites, form a bodyguard around the king and keep your weapons in hand. Kill anyone who tries to enter the Temple. Stay with the king wherever he goes."
142Ch 23:8 So the Levites and all the people of Judah did everything as Jehoiada the priest ordered. The commanders took charge of the men reporting for duty that Sabbath, as well as those who were going off duty. Jehoiada the priest did not let anyone go home after their shift ended.
142Ch 23:9 Then Jehoiada supplied the commanders with the spears and the large and small shields that had once belonged to King David and were stored in the Temple of God.
142Ch 23:10 He stationed all the people around the king, with their weapons ready. They formed a line from the south side of the Temple around to the north side and all around the altar.
142Ch 23:11 Then Jehoiada and his sons brought out Joash, the king's son, placed the crown on his head, and presented him with a copy of God's laws��. They anointed him and proclaimed him king, and everyone shouted, "Long live the king!" / ��Or a copy of the covenant
142Ch 23:12 When Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and the shouts of praise to the king, she hurried to the LORD's Temple to see what was happening.
142Ch 23:13 When she arrived, she saw the newly crowned king standing in his place of authority by the pillar at the Temple entrance. The commanders and trumpeters were surrounding him, and people from all over the land were rejoicing and blowing trumpets. Singers with musical instruments were leading the people in a great celebration. When Athaliah saw all this, she tore her clothes in despair and shouted, "Treason! Treason!"
142Ch 23:14 Then Jehoiada the priest ordered the commanders who were in charge of the troops, "Take her to the soldiers in front of the Temple��, and kill anyone who tries to rescue her." For the priest had said, "She must not be killed in the Temple of the LORD." / ��Or Bring her out from between the ranks; or Take her out of the Temple precincts. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
142Ch 23:15 So they seized her and led her out to the entrance of the Horse Gate on the palace grounds, and they killed her there.
142Ch 23:16 Then Jehoiada made a covenant between himself and the king and the people that they would be the LORD's people.
142Ch 23:17 And all the people went over to the temple of Baal and tore it down. They demolished the altars and smashed the idols, and they killed Mattan the priest of Baal in front of the altars.
142Ch 23:18 Jehoiada now put the priests and Levites in charge of the Temple of the LORD, following all the directions given by David. He also commanded them to present burnt offerings to the LORD, as prescribed by the Law of Moses, and to sing and rejoice as David had instructed.
142Ch 23:19 He also stationed gatekeepers at the gates of the LORD's Temple to keep out those who for any reason were ceremonially unclean.
142Ch 23:20 Then the commanders, nobles, rulers, and all the people of the land escorted the king from the Temple of the LORD. They went through the upper gate and into the palace, and they seated the king on the royal throne.
142Ch 23:21 So all the people of the land rejoiced, and the city was peaceful because Athaliah had been killed.
142Ch 24:1 Joash was seven years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem forty years. His mother was Zibiah from Beersheba.
142Ch 24:2 Joash did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight throughout the lifetime of Jehoiada the priest.
142Ch 24:3 Jehoiada chose two wives for Joash, and he had sons and daughters.
142Ch 24:4 At one point Joash decided to repair and restore the Temple of the LORD.
142Ch 24:5 He summoned the priests and Levites and gave them these instructions�� "Go to all the towns of Judah and collect the required annual offerings, so that we can repair the Temple of your God. Do not delay!" But the Levites did not act immediately.
142Ch 24:6 So the king called for Jehoiada the high priest and asked him, "Why haven't you demanded that the Levites go out and collect the Temple taxes from the towns of Judah and from Jerusalem? Moses, the servant of the LORD, levied this tax on the community of Israel in order to maintain the Tabernacle of the Covenant��." / ��Hebrew Tent of the Testimony
142Ch 24:7 Over the years the followers of wicked Athaliah had broken into the Temple of God, and they had used all the dedicated things from the Temple of the LORD to worship the images of Baal.
142Ch 24:8 So now the king ordered a chest to be made and set outside the gate leading to the Temple of the LORD.
142Ch 24:9 Then a proclamation was sent throughout Judah and Jerusalem, telling the people to bring to the LORD the tax that Moses, the servant of God, had required of the Israelites in the wilderness.
142Ch 24:10 This pleased all the leaders and the people, and they gladly brought their money and filled the chest with it.
142Ch 24:11 Whenever the chest became full, the Levites would carry it to the king's officials. Then the court secretary and an officer of the high priest would come and empty the chest and take it back to the Temple again. This went on day after day, and a large amount of money was collected.
142Ch 24:12 The king and Jehoiada gave the money to the construction supervisors, who hired masons and carpenters to restore the Temple of the LORD. They also hired metalworkers, who made articles of iron and bronze for the LORD's Temple.
142Ch 24:13 The men in charge of the renovation worked hard and made steady progress. They restored the Temple of God according to its original design and strengthened it.
142Ch 24:14 When all the repairs were finished, they brought the remaining money to the king and Jehoiada. It was used to make various articles for the Temple of the LORD - articles for worship services and for burnt offerings, including ladles and other articles made of gold and silver. And the burnt offerings were sacrificed continually in the Temple of the LORD during the lifetime of Jehoiada the priest.
142Ch 24:15 Jehoiada lived to a very old age, finally dying at 130.
142Ch 24:16 He was buried among the kings in the City of David, because he had done so much good in Israel for God and his Temple.
142Ch 24:17 But after Jehoiada's death, the leaders of Judah came and bowed before King Joash and persuaded him to listen to their advice.
142Ch 24:18 They decided to abandon the Temple of the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and they worshiped Asherah poles and idols instead! Because of this sin, divine anger fell on Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 24:19 Yet the LORD sent prophets to bring them back to him. The prophets warned them, but still the people would not listen.
142Ch 24:20 Then the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah son of Jehoiada the priest. He stood before the people and said, "This is what God says�� Why do you disobey the LORD's commands and keep yourselves from prospering? You have abandoned the LORD, and now he has abandoned you!"
142Ch 24:21 Then the leaders plotted to kill Zechariah, and King Joash ordered that they stone him to death in the courtyard of the LORD's Temple.
142Ch 24:22 That was how King Joash repaid Jehoiada for his loyalty - by killing his son. Zechariah's last words as he died were, "May the LORD see what they are doing and avenge my death!"
142Ch 24:23 In the spring of the year�� the Aramean army marched against Joash. They invaded Judah and Jerusalem and killed all the leaders of the nation. Then they sent all the plunder back to their king in Damascus. / ��Hebrew At the turn of the year. The first day of the year in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in March or April
142Ch 24:24 Although the Arameans attacked with only a small army, the LORD helped them conquer the much larger army of Judah. The people of Judah had abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors, so judgment was carried out against Joash.
142Ch 24:25 The Arameans withdrew, leaving Joash severely wounded. But his own officials plotted to kill him for murdering the son�� of Jehoiada the priest. They assassinated him as he lay in bed. Then he was buried in the City of David, but not in the royal cemetery. / ��As in Greek version and Latin Vulgate; Hebrew reads sons
142Ch 24:26 The assassins were Jozacar��, the son of an Ammonite woman named Shimeath, and Jehozabad, the son of a Moabite woman named Shomer��. / ��As in parallel text at 2 Kgs 12.21; Hebrew reads Zabad ��As in parallel text at 2 Kgs 12.21; Hebrew reads Shimrith, a variant spelling of Shomer
142Ch 24:27 The account of the sons of Joash, the prophecies about him, and the record of his restoration of the Temple of God are written in The Commentary on the Book of the Kings. His son Amaziah became the next king.
142Ch 25:1 Amaziah was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother was Jehoaddin�� from Jerusalem. / ��As in parallel text at 2 Kgs 14.2; Hebrew reads Jehoaddan, a variant spelling of Jehoaddin
142Ch 25:2 Amaziah did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight, but not wholeheartedly.
142Ch 25:3 When Amaziah was well established as king, he executed the officials who had assassinated his father.
142Ch 25:4 However, he did not kill the children of the assassins, for he obeyed the command of the LORD as written by Moses in the Book of the Law�� "Parents must not be put to death for the sins of their children, nor children for the sins of their parents. Those deserving to die must be put to death for their own crimes."�� / ��Deut 24.16
142Ch 25:5 Then Amaziah organized the army, assigning generals and captains�� for all Judah and Benjamin. He took a census and found that he had an army of 300,000 select troops, twenty years old and older, all trained in the use of spear and shield. / ��Hebrew commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds
142Ch 25:6 He also paid about 7,500 pounds�� of silver to hire 100,000 experienced fighting men from Israel. / ��Hebrew 100 talents [3,400 kilograms]
142Ch 25:7 But a man of God came to him and said, "Your Majesty, do not hire troops from Israel, for the LORD is not with Israel. He will not help those people of Ephraim!
142Ch 25:8 If you let them go with your troops into battle, you will be defeated by the enemy no matter how well you fight. God will overthrow you, for he has the power to help you or to trip you up."
142Ch 25:9 Amaziah asked the man of God, "But what about all that silver I paid to hire the army of Israel?" The man of God replied, "The LORD is able to give you much more than this!"
142Ch 25:10 So Amaziah discharged the hired troops and sent them back to Ephraim. This made them very angry with Judah, and they returned home in a great rage.
142Ch 25:11 Then Amaziah summoned his courage and led his army to the Valley of Salt, where they killed 10,000 Edomite troops from Seir.
142Ch 25:12 They captured another 10,000 and took them to the top of a cliff and threw them off, dashing them to pieces on the rocks below.
142Ch 25:13 Meanwhile, the hired troops that Amaziah had sent home raided several of the towns of Judah between Samaria and Beth-horon. They killed 3,000 people and carried off great quantities of plunder.
142Ch 25:14 When King Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, he brought with him idols taken from the people of Seir. He set them up as his own gods, bowed down in front of them, and offered sacrifices to them!
142Ch 25:15 This made the LORD very angry, and he sent a prophet to ask, "Why do you turn to gods who could not even save their own people from you?"
142Ch 25:16 But the king interrupted him and said, "Since when have I made you the king's counselor? Be quiet now before I have you killed!" So the prophet stopped with this warning�� "I know that God has determined to destroy you because you have done this and have refused to accept my counsel."
142Ch 25:17 After consulting with his advisers, King Amaziah of Judah sent this challenge to Israel's king Jehoash��, the son of Jehoahaz and grandson of Jehu�� "Come and meet me in battle!"�� / ��Hebrew Joash, a variant spelling of Jehoash; also in 25.18, 21, 23, 25 ��Hebrew Come, let us look one another in the face
142Ch 25:18 But King Jehoash of Israel replied to King Amaziah of Judah with this story�� "Out in the Lebanon mountains, a thistle sent a message to a mighty cedar tree�� 'Give your daughter in marriage to my son.' But just then a wild animal of Lebanon came by and stepped on the thistle, crushing it!
142Ch 25:19 "You are saying, 'I have defeated Edom,' and you are very proud of it. But my advice is to stay at home. Why stir up trouble that will only bring disaster on you and the people of Judah?"
142Ch 25:20 But Amaziah refused to listen, for God was determined to destroy him for turning to the gods of Edom.
142Ch 25:21 So King Jehoash of Israel mobilized his army against King Amaziah of Judah. The two armies drew up their battle lines at Beth-shemesh in Judah.
142Ch 25:22 Judah was routed by the army of Israel, and its army scattered and fled for home.
142Ch 25:23 King Jehoash of Israel captured Judah's king, Amaziah son of Joash and grandson of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh. Then he brought him to Jerusalem, where he demolished 600 feet�� of Jerusalem's wall, from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. / ��Hebrew 400 cubits [180 meters]
142Ch 25:24 He carried off all the gold and silver and all the articles from the Temple of God that had been in the care of Obed-edom. He also seized the treasures of the royal palace, along with hostages, and then returned to Samaria.
142Ch 25:25 King Amaziah of Judah lived on for fifteen years after the death of King Jehoash of Israel.
142Ch 25:26 The rest of the events in Amaziah's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 25:27 After Amaziah turned away from the LORD, there was a conspiracy against his life in Jerusalem, and he fled to Lachish. But his enemies sent assassins after him, and they killed him there.
142Ch 25:28 They brought his body back on a horse, and he was buried with his ancestors in the City of David��. / ��As in some Hebrew manuscripts and other ancient versions (see also 2 Kgs 14.20); most Hebrew manuscripts read the city of Judah
142Ch 26:1 All the people of Judah had crowned Amaziah's sixteen-year-old son, Uzziah, as king in place of his father.
142Ch 26:2 After his father's death, Uzziah rebuilt the town of Elath�� and restored it to Judah. / ��As in Greek version (see also 2 Kgs 14.22; 16.6); Hebrew reads Eloth, a variant spelling of Elath
142Ch 26:3 Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-two years. His mother was Jecoliah from Jerusalem.
142Ch 26:4 He did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight, just as his father, Amaziah, had done.
142Ch 26:5 Uzziah sought God during the days of Zechariah, who taught him to fear God��. And as long as the king sought guidance from the LORD, God gave him success. / ��As in Syriac and Greek versions; Hebrew reads who instructed him in divine visions
142Ch 26:6 Uzziah declared war on the Philistines and broke down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod. Then he built new towns in the Ashdod area and in other parts of Philistia.
142Ch 26:7 God helped him in his wars against the Philistines, his battles with the Arabs of Gur��, and his wars with the Meunites. / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew reads Gur-baal
142Ch 26:8 The Meunites�� paid annual tribute to him, and his fame spread even to Egypt, for he had become very powerful. / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew reads Ammonites. Compare 26.7
142Ch 26:9 Uzziah built fortified towers in Jerusalem at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the angle in the wall.
142Ch 26:10 He also constructed forts in the wilderness and dug many water cisterns, because he kept great herds of livestock in the foothills of Judah�� and on the plains. He was also a man who loved the soil. He had many workers who cared for his farms and vineyards, both on the hillsides and in the fertile valleys. / ��Hebrew the Shephelah
142Ch 26:11 Uzziah had an army of well-trained warriors, ready to march into battle, unit by unit. This army had been mustered and organized by Jeiel, the secretary of the army, and his assistant, Maaseiah. They were under the direction of Hananiah, one of the king's officials.
142Ch 26:12 These regiments of mighty warriors were commanded by 2,600 clan leaders.
142Ch 26:13 The army consisted of 307,500 men, all elite troops. They were prepared to assist the king against any enemy.
142Ch 26:14 Uzziah provided the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, coats of mail, bows, and sling stones.
142Ch 26:15 And he built structures on the walls of Jerusalem, designed by experts to protect those who shot arrows and hurled large stones�� from the towers and the corners of the wall. His fame spread far and wide, for the LORD gave him marvelous help, and he became very powerful. / ��Or to shoot arrows and hurl large stones
142Ch 26:16 But when he had become powerful, he also became proud, which led to his downfall. He sinned against the LORD his God by entering the sanctuary of the LORD's Temple and personally burning incense on the incense altar.
142Ch 26:17 Azariah the high priest went in after him with eighty other priests of the LORD, all brave men.
142Ch 26:18 They confronted King Uzziah and said, "It is not for you, Uzziah, to burn incense to the LORD. That is the work of the priests alone, the descendants of Aaron who are set apart for this work. Get out of the sanctuary, for you have sinned. The LORD God will not honor you for this!"
142Ch 26:19 Uzziah, who was holding an incense burner, became furious. But as he was standing there raging at the priests before the incense altar in the LORD's Temple, leprosy�� suddenly broke out on his forehead. / ��Or a contagious skin disease. The Hebrew word used here and throughout this passage can describe various skin diseases
142Ch 26:20 When Azariah the high priest and all the other priests saw the leprosy, they rushed him out. And the king himself was eager to get out because the LORD had struck him.
142Ch 26:21 So King Uzziah had leprosy until the day he died. He lived in isolation in a separate house, for he was excluded from the Temple of the LORD. His son Jotham was put in charge of the royal palace, and he governed the people of the land.
142Ch 26:22 The rest of the events of Uzziah's reign, from beginning to end, are recorded by the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz.
142Ch 26:23 When Uzziah died, he was buried with his ancestors; his grave was in a nearby burial field belonging to the kings, for the people said, "He had leprosy." And his son Jotham became the next king.
142Ch 27:1 Jotham was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. His mother was Jerusha, the daughter of Zadok.
142Ch 27:2 Jotham did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight. He did everything his father, Uzziah, had done, except that Jotham did not sin by entering the Temple of the LORD. But the people continued in their corrupt ways.
142Ch 27:3 Jotham rebuilt the upper gate of the Temple of the LORD. He also did extensive rebuilding on the wall at the hill of Ophel.
142Ch 27:4 He built towns in the hill country of Judah and constructed fortresses and towers in the wooded areas.
142Ch 27:5 Jotham went to war against the Ammonites and conquered them. Over the next three years he received from them an annual tribute of 7,500 pounds�� of silver, 50,000 bushels of wheat, and 50,000 bushels of barley��. / ��Hebrew 100 talents [3,400 kilograms] ��Hebrew 10,000 cors [1,820 kiloliters] of wheat, and 10,000 cors of barley
142Ch 27:6 King Jotham became powerful because he was careful to live in obedience to the LORD his God.
142Ch 27:7 The rest of the events of Jotham's reign, including all his wars and other activities, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
142Ch 27:8 He was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years.
142Ch 27:9 When Jotham died, he was buried in the City of David. And his son Ahaz became the next king.
142Ch 28:1 Ahaz was twenty years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem sixteen years. He did not do what was pleasing in the sight of the LORD, as his ancestor David had done.
142Ch 28:2 Instead, he followed the example of the kings of Israel. He cast metal images for the worship of Baal.
142Ch 28:3 He offered sacrifices in the valley of Ben-Hinnom, even sacrificing his own sons in the fire��. In this way, he followed the detestable practices of the pagan nations the LORD had driven from the land ahead of the Israelites. / ��Or even making his sons pass through the fire
142Ch 28:4 He offered sacrifices and burned incense at the pagan shrines and on the hills and under every green tree.
142Ch 28:5 Because of all this, the LORD his God allowed the king of Aram to defeat Ahaz and to exile large numbers of his people to Damascus. The armies of the king of Israel also defeated Ahaz and inflicted many casualties on his army.
142Ch 28:6 In a single day Pekah son of Remaliah, Israel's king, killed 120,000 of Judah's troops, all of them experienced warriors, because they had abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
142Ch 28:7 Then Zicri, a warrior from Ephraim, killed Maaseiah, the king's son; Azrikam, the king's palace commander; and Elkanah, the king's second-in-command.
142Ch 28:8 The armies of Israel captured 200,000 women and children from Judah and seized tremendous amounts of plunder, which they took back to Samaria.
142Ch 28:9 But a prophet of the LORD named Oded was there in Samaria when the army of Israel returned home. He went out to meet them and said, "The LORD, the God of your ancestors, was angry with Judah and let you defeat them. But you have gone too far, killing them without mercy, and all heaven is disturbed.
142Ch 28:10 And now you are planning to make slaves of these people from Judah and Jerusalem. What about your own sins against the LORD your God?
142Ch 28:11 Listen to me and return these prisoners you have taken, for they are your own relatives. Watch out, because now the LORD's fierce anger has been turned against you!"
142Ch 28:12 Then some of the leaders of Israel�� - Azariah son of Jehohanan, Berekiah son of Meshillemoth, Jehizkiah son of Shallum, and Amasa son of Hadlai - agreed with this and confronted the men returning from battle. / ��Hebrew Ephraim, referring to the northern kingdom of Israel
142Ch 28:13 "You must not bring the prisoners here!" they declared. "We cannot afford to add to our sins and guilt. Our guilt is already great, and the LORD's fierce anger is already turned against Israel."
142Ch 28:14 So the warriors released the prisoners and handed over the plunder in the sight of the leaders and all the people.
142Ch 28:15 Then the four men just mentioned by name came forward and distributed clothes from the plunder to the prisoners who were naked. They provided clothing and sandals to wear, gave them enough food and drink, and dressed their wounds with olive oil. They put those who were weak on donkeys and took all the prisoners back to their own people in Jericho, the city of palms. Then they returned to Samaria.
142Ch 28:16 At that time King Ahaz of Judah asked the king of Assyria for help.
142Ch 28:17 The armies of Edom had again invaded Judah and taken captives.
142Ch 28:18 And the Philistines had raided towns located in the foothills of Judah�� and in the Negev of Judah. They had already captured and occupied Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco with its villages, Timnah with its villages, and Gimzo with its villages. / ��Hebrew the Shephelah

142Ch 28:20 So when King Tiglath-pileser�� of Assyria arrived, he attacked Ahaz instead of helping him. / ��Hebrew Tilgath-pilneser, a variant spelling of Tiglath-pileser
142Ch 28:21 Ahaz took valuable items from the LORD's Temple, the royal palace, and from the homes of his officials and gave them to the king of Assyria as tribute. But this did not help him.
142Ch 28:22 Even during this time of trouble, King Ahaz continued to reject the LORD.
142Ch 28:23 He offered sacrifices to the gods of Damascus who had defeated him, for he said, "Since these gods helped the kings of Aram, they will help me, too, if I sacrifice to them." But instead, they led to his ruin and the ruin of all Judah.
142Ch 28:24 The king took the various articles from the Temple of God and broke them into pieces. He shut the doors of the LORD's Temple so that no one could worship there, and he set up altars to pagan gods in every corner of Jerusalem.
142Ch 28:25 He made pagan shrines in all the towns of Judah for offering sacrifices to other gods. In this way, he aroused the anger of the LORD, the God of his ancestors.
142Ch 28:26 The rest of the events of Ahaz's reign and everything he did, from beginning to end, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 28:27 When Ahaz died, he was buried in Jerusalem but not in the royal cemetery of the kings of Judah. Then his son Hezekiah became the next king.
142Ch 29:1 Hezekiah was twenty-five years old when he became the king of Judah, and he reigned in Jerusalem twenty-nine years. His mother was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.
142Ch 29:2 He did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight, just as his ancestor David had done.
142Ch 29:3 In the very first month of the first year of his reign, Hezekiah reopened the doors of the Temple of the LORD and repaired them.
142Ch 29:4 He summoned the priests and Levites to meet him at the courtyard east of the Temple.
142Ch 29:5 He said to them, "Listen to me, you Levites! Purify yourselves, and purify the Temple of the LORD, the God of your ancestors. Remove all the defiled things from the sanctuary.
142Ch 29:6 Our ancestors were unfaithful and did what was evil in the sight of the LORD our God. They abandoned the LORD and his dwelling place; they turned their backs on him.
142Ch 29:7 They also shut the doors to the Temple's entry room, and they snuffed out the lamps. They stopped burning incense and presenting burnt offerings at the sanctuary of the God of Israel.
142Ch 29:8 "That is why the LORD's anger has fallen upon Judah and Jerusalem. He has made them an object of dread, horror, and ridicule, as you can see with your own eyes.
142Ch 29:9 Because of this, our fathers have been killed in battle, and our sons and daughters and wives have been captured.
142Ch 29:10 But now I will make a covenant with the LORD, the God of Israel, so that his fierce anger will turn away from us.
142Ch 29:11 My sons, do not neglect your duties any longer! The LORD has chosen you to stand in his presence, to minister to him, and to lead the people in worship and present offerings to him."
142Ch 29:12 Then these Levites got right to work�� From the clan of Kohath�� Mahath son of Amasai and Joel son of Azariah. From the clan of Merari�� Kish son of Abdi and Azariah son of Jehallelel. From the clan of Gershon�� Joah son of Zimmah and Eden son of Joah.
142Ch 29:13 From the family of Elizaphan�� Shimri and Jeiel. From the family of Asaph�� Zechariah and Mattaniah.
142Ch 29:14 From the family of Heman�� Jehiel and Shimei. From the family of Jeduthun�� Shemaiah and Uzziel.
142Ch 29:15 These men called together their fellow Levites, and they all purified themselves. Then they began to cleanse the Temple of the LORD, just as the king had commanded. They were careful to follow all the LORD's instructions in their work.
142Ch 29:16 The priests went into the sanctuary of the Temple of the LORD to cleanse it, and they took out to the Temple courtyard all the defiled things they found. From there the Levites carted it all out to the Kidron Valley.
142Ch 29:17 They began the work in early spring, on the first day of the new year��, and in eight days they had reached the entry room of the LORD's Temple. Then they purified the Temple of the LORD itself, which took another eight days. So the entire task was completed in sixteen days. / ��Hebrew on the first day of the first month. This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in March or early April, 715 B.C.
142Ch 29:18 Then the Levites went to King Hezekiah and gave him this report�� "We have cleansed the entire Temple of the LORD, the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the table of the Bread of the Presence with all its utensils.
142Ch 29:19 We have also recovered all the items discarded by King Ahaz when he was unfaithful and closed the Temple. They are now in front of the altar of the LORD, purified and ready for use."
142Ch 29:20 Early the next morning King Hezekiah gathered the city officials and went to the Temple of the LORD.
142Ch 29:21 They brought seven bulls, seven rams, and seven male lambs as a burnt offering, together with seven male goats as a sin offering for the kingdom, for the Temple, and for Judah. The king commanded the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, to sacrifice the animals on the altar of the LORD.
142Ch 29:22 So they killed the bulls, and the priests took the blood and sprinkled it on the altar. Next they killed the rams and sprinkled their blood on the altar. And finally, they did the same with the male lambs.
142Ch 29:23 The male goats for the sin offering were then brought before the king and the assembly of people, who laid their hands on them.
142Ch 29:24 The priests then killed the goats as a sin offering and sprinkled their blood on the altar to make atonement for the sins of all Israel. The king had specifically commanded that this burnt offering and sin offering should be made for all Israel.
142Ch 29:25 King Hezekiah then stationed the Levites at the Temple of the LORD with cymbals, lyres, and harps. He obeyed all the commands that the LORD had given to King David through Gad, the king's seer, and the prophet Nathan.
142Ch 29:26 The Levites then took their positions around the Temple with the instruments of David, and the priests took their positions with the trumpets.
142Ch 29:27 Then Hezekiah ordered that the burnt offering be placed on the altar. As the burnt offering was presented, songs of praise to the LORD were begun, accompanied by the trumpets and other instruments of David, the former king of Israel.
142Ch 29:28 The entire assembly worshiped the LORD as the singers sang and the trumpets blew, until all the burnt offerings were finished.
142Ch 29:29 Then the king and everyone with him bowed down in worship.
142Ch 29:30 King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levites to praise the LORD with the psalms written by David and by Asaph the seer. So they offered joyous praise and bowed down in worship.
142Ch 29:31 Then Hezekiah declared, "Now that you have consecrated yourselves to the LORD, bring your sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings to the Temple of the LORD." So the people brought their sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings, and all whose hearts were willing brought burnt offerings, too.
142Ch 29:32 The people brought to the LORD 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 male lambs for burnt offerings.
142Ch 29:33 They also brought 600 cattle and 3,000 sheep and goats as sacred offerings.
142Ch 29:34 But there were too few priests to prepare all the burnt offerings. So their relatives the Levites helped them until the work was finished and more priests had been purified, for the Levites had been more conscientious about purifying themselves than the priests had been.
142Ch 29:35 There was an abundance of burnt offerings, along with the usual liquid offerings, and a great deal of fat from the many peace offerings. So the Temple of the LORD was restored to service.
142Ch 29:36 And Hezekiah and all the people rejoiced because of what God had done for the people, for everything had been accomplished so quickly.
142Ch 30:1 King Hezekiah now sent word to all Israel and Judah, and he wrote letters of invitation to the people of Ephraim and Manasseh. He asked everyone to come to the Temple of the LORD at Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the LORD, the God of Israel.
142Ch 30:2 The king, his officials, and all the community of Jerusalem decided to celebrate Passover a month later than usual��. / ��Hebrew in the second month. Passover was normally observed in the first month (of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar)
142Ch 30:3 They were unable to celebrate it at the prescribed time because not enough priests could be purified by then, and the people had not yet assembled at Jerusalem.
142Ch 30:4 This plan for keeping the Passover seemed right to the king and all the people.
142Ch 30:5 So they sent a proclamation throughout all Israel, from Beersheba in the south to Dan in the north, inviting everyone to come to Jerusalem to celebrate the Passover of the LORD, the God of Israel. The people had not been celebrating it in great numbers as required in the Law.
142Ch 30:6 At the king's command, runners were sent throughout Israel and Judah. They carried letters that said�� "O people of Israel, return to the LORD, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel��, so that he will return to the few of us who have survived the conquest of the Assyrian kings. / ��Israel is the name that God gave to Jacob
142Ch 30:7 Do not be like your ancestors and relatives who abandoned the LORD, the God of their ancestors, and became an object of derision, as you yourselves can see.
142Ch 30:8 Do not be stubborn, as they were, but submit yourselves to the LORD. Come to his Temple, which he has set apart as holy forever. Worship the LORD your God so that his fierce anger will turn away from you.
142Ch 30:9 "For if you return to the LORD, your relatives and your children will be treated mercifully by their captors, and they will be able to return to this land. For the LORD your God is gracious and merciful. If you return to him, he will not continue to turn his face from you."
142Ch 30:10 The runners went from town to town throughout Ephraim and Manasseh and as far as the territory of Zebulun. But most of the people just laughed at the runners and made fun of them.
142Ch 30:11 However, some people from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and went to Jerusalem.
142Ch 30:12 At the same time, God's hand was on the people in the land of Judah, giving them all one heart to obey the orders of the king and his officials, who were following the word of the LORD.
142Ch 30:13 So a huge crowd assembled at Jerusalem in midspring�� to celebrate the Festival of Unleavened Bread. / ��Hebrew in the second month. The second month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of April and May
142Ch 30:14 They set to work and removed the pagan altars from Jerusalem. They took away all the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Valley.
142Ch 30:15 On the fourteenth day of the second month, one month later than usual��, the people slaughtered the Passover lamb. This shamed the priests and Levites, so they purified themselves and brought burnt offerings to the Temple of the LORD. / ��Hebrew On the fourteenth day of the second month. Passover normally began on the fourteenth day of the first month (see Lev 23.5)
142Ch 30:16 Then they took their places at the Temple as prescribed in the Law of Moses, the man of God. The Levites brought the sacrificial blood to the priests, who then sprinkled it on the altar.
142Ch 30:17 Since many of the people had not purified themselves, the Levites had to slaughter their Passover lamb for them, to set them apart for the LORD.
142Ch 30:18 Most of those who came from Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not purified themselves. But King Hezekiah prayed for them, and they were allowed to eat the Passover meal anyway, even though this was contrary to the requirements of the Law. For Hezekiah said, "May the LORD, who is good, pardon those
142Ch 30:19 who decide to follow the LORD, the God of their ancestors, even though they are not properly cleansed for the ceremony."
142Ch 30:20 And the LORD listened to Hezekiah's prayer and healed the people.
142Ch 30:21 So the people of Israel who were present in Jerusalem joyously celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days. Each day the Levites and priests sang to the LORD, accompanied by loud instruments��. / ��Or sang to the LORD with all their strength
142Ch 30:22 Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites regarding the skill they displayed as they served the LORD. The celebration continued for seven days. Peace offerings were sacrificed, and the people gave thanks to the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
142Ch 30:23 The entire assembly then decided to continue the festival another seven days, so they celebrated joyfully for another week.
142Ch 30:24 King Hezekiah gave the people 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep and goats for offerings, and the officials donated 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep and goats. Meanwhile, many more priests purified themselves.
142Ch 30:25 The entire assembly of Judah rejoiced, including the priests, the Levites, all who came from the land of Israel, the foreigners who came to the festival, and all those who lived in Judah.
142Ch 30:26 There was great joy in the city, for Jerusalem had not seen a celebration like this one since the days of Solomon, King David's son.
142Ch 30:27 Then the priests and Levites stood and blessed the people, and God heard their prayer from his holy dwelling in heaven.
142Ch 31:1 When the festival ended, the Israelites who attended went to all the towns of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh, and they smashed all the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherah poles, and removed the pagan shrines and altars. After this, the Israelites returned to their own towns and homes.
142Ch 31:2 Hezekiah then organized the priests and Levites into divisions to offer the burnt offerings and peace offerings, and to worship and give thanks and praise to the LORD at the gates of the Temple.
142Ch 31:3 The king also made a personal contribution of animals for the daily morning and evening burnt offerings, the weekly Sabbath festivals, the monthly new moon festivals, and the annual festivals as prescribed in the Law of the LORD.
142Ch 31:4 In addition, he required the people in Jerusalem to bring a portion of their goods to the priests and Levites, so they could devote themselves fully to the Law of the LORD.
142Ch 31:5 When the people of Israel heard these requirements, they responded generously by bringing the first share of their grain, new wine, olive oil, honey, and all the produce of their fields. They brought a large quantity - a tithe of all they produced.
142Ch 31:6 The people who had moved to Judah from Israel, and the people of Judah themselves, brought in the tithes of their cattle, sheep, and goats and a tithe of the things that had been dedicated to the LORD their God, and they piled them up in great heaps.
142Ch 31:7 They began piling them up in late spring, and the heaps continued to grow until early autumn��. / ��Hebrew in the third month . . . until the seventh month. The third month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of May and June; the seventh month usually occurs within September and October
142Ch 31:8 When Hezekiah and his officials came and saw these huge piles, they thanked the LORD and his people Israel!
142Ch 31:9 "Where did all this come from?" Hezekiah asked the priests and Levites.
142Ch 31:10 And Azariah the high priest, from the family of Zadok, replied, "Since the people began bringing their gifts to the LORD's Temple, we have had enough to eat and plenty to spare. The LORD has blessed his people, and all this is left over."
142Ch 31:11 Hezekiah ordered that storerooms be prepared in the Temple of the LORD. When this was done,
142Ch 31:12 the people faithfully brought all the tithes and gifts to the Temple. Conaniah the Levite was put in charge, assisted by his brother Shimei.
142Ch 31:13 The supervisors under them were Jehiel, Azaziah, Nahath, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismakiah, Mahath, and Benaiah. These appointments were made by King Hezekiah and Azariah, the chief official in the Temple of God.
142Ch 31:14 Kore son of Imnah the Levite, who was the gatekeeper at the East Gate, was put in charge of distributing the voluntary offerings given to God, the gifts, and the things that had been dedicated to the LORD.
142Ch 31:15 His faithful assistants were Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah. They distributed the gifts among the families of priests in their towns by their divisions, dividing the gifts fairly among old and young alike.
142Ch 31:16 They distributed the gifts to all males three years old or older, regardless of their place in the genealogical records. The distribution went to all who would come to the LORD's Temple to perform their daily duties according to their divisions.
142Ch 31:17 They distributed gifts to the priests who were listed by their families in the genealogical records, and to the Levites twenty years old or older who were listed according to their jobs and their divisions.
142Ch 31:18 Food allotments were also given to the families of all those listed in the genealogical records, including their little babies, wives, sons, and daughters. For they had all been faithful in purifying themselves.
142Ch 31:19 As for the priests, the descendants of Aaron, who were living in the open villages around the towns, men were appointed by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to all the Levites listed in the genealogical records.
142Ch 31:20 In this way, King Hezekiah handled the distribution throughout all Judah, doing what was pleasing and good in the sight of the LORD his God.
142Ch 31:21 In all that he did in the service of the Temple of God and in his efforts to follow God's laws and commands, Hezekiah sought his God wholeheartedly. As a result, he was very successful.
142Ch 32:1 After Hezekiah had faithfully carried out this work, King Sennacherib of Assyria invaded Judah. He laid siege to the fortified towns, giving orders for his army to break through their walls.
142Ch 32:2 When Hezekiah realized that Sennacherib also intended to attack Jerusalem,
142Ch 32:3 he consulted with his officials and military advisers, and they decided to stop the flow of the springs outside the city.
142Ch 32:4 They organized a huge work crew to stop the flow of the springs, cutting off the brook that ran through the fields. For they said, "Why should the kings of Assyria come here and find plenty of water?"
142Ch 32:5 Then Hezekiah worked hard at repairing all the broken sections of the wall, erecting towers, and constructing a second wall outside the first. He also reinforced the supporting terraces�� in the City of David and manufactured large numbers of weapons and shields. / ��Hebrew the millo. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
142Ch 32:6 He appointed military officers over the people and assembled them before him in the square at the city gate. Then Hezekiah encouraged them by saying.
142Ch 32:7 "Be strong and courageous! Don't be afraid or discouraged because of the king of Assyria or his mighty army, for there is a power far greater on our side!
142Ch 32:8 He may have a great army, but they are merely men. We have the LORD our God to help us and to fight our battles for us!" Hezekiah's words greatly encouraged the people.
142Ch 32:9 While King Sennacherib of Assyria was still besieging the town of Lachish, he sent his officers to Jerusalem with this message for Hezekiah and all the people in the city.
142Ch 32:10 "This is what King Sennacherib of Assyria says�� What are you trusting in that makes you think you can survive my siege of Jerusalem?
142Ch 32:11 Hezekiah has said, 'The LORD our God will rescue us from the king of Assyria.' Surely Hezekiah is misleading you, sentencing you to death by famine and thirst!
142Ch 32:12 Don't you realize that Hezekiah is the very person who destroyed all the LORD's shrines and altars? He commanded Judah and Jerusalem to worship only at the altar at the Temple and to offer sacrifices on it alone.
142Ch 32:13 "Surely you must realize what I and the other kings of Assyria before me have done to all the people of the earth! Were any of the gods of those nations able to rescue their people from my power?
142Ch 32:14 Which of their gods was able to rescue its people from the destructive power of my predecessors? What makes you think your God can rescue you from me?
142Ch 32:15 Don't let Hezekiah deceive you! Don't let him fool you like this! I say it again - no god of any nation or kingdom has ever yet been able to rescue his people from me or my ancestors. How much less will your God rescue you from my power!"
142Ch 32:16 And Sennacherib's officers further mocked the LORD God and his servant Hezekiah, heaping insult upon insult.
142Ch 32:17 The king also sent letters scorning the LORD, the God of Israel. He wrote, "Just as the gods of all the other nations failed to rescue their people from my power, so the God of Hezekiah will also fail."
142Ch 32:18 The Assyrian officials who brought the letters shouted this in Hebrew�� to the people gathered on the walls of the city, trying to terrify them so it would be easier to capture the city. / ��Hebrew in the dialect of Judah
142Ch 32:19 These officers talked about the God of Jerusalem as though he were one of the pagan gods, made by human hands.
142Ch 32:20 Then King Hezekiah and the prophet Isaiah son of Amoz cried out in prayer to God in heaven.
142Ch 32:21 And the LORD sent an angel who destroyed the Assyrian army with all its commanders and officers. So Sennacherib was forced to return home in disgrace to his own land. And when he entered the temple of his god, some of his own sons killed him there with a sword.
142Ch 32:22 That is how the LORD rescued Hezekiah and the people of Jerusalem from King Sennacherib of Assyria and from all the others who threatened them. So there was peace throughout the land.
142Ch 32:23 From then on King Hezekiah became highly respected among all the surrounding nations, and many gifts for the LORD arrived at Jerusalem, with valuable presents for King Hezekiah, too.
142Ch 32:24 About that time Hezekiah became deathly ill. He prayed to the LORD, who healed him and gave him a miraculous sign.
142Ch 32:25 But Hezekiah did not respond appropriately to the kindness shown him, and he became proud. So the LORD's anger came against him and against Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 32:26 Then Hezekiah humbled himself and repented of his pride, as did the people of Jerusalem. So the LORD's anger did not fall on them during Hezekiah's lifetime.
142Ch 32:27 Hezekiah was very wealthy and highly honored. He built special treasury buildings for his silver, gold, precious stones, and spices, and for his shields and other valuable items.
142Ch 32:28 He also constructed many storehouses for his grain, new wine, and olive oil; and he made many stalls for his cattle and pens for his flocks of sheep and goats.
142Ch 32:29 He built many towns and acquired vast flocks and herds, for God had given him great wealth.
142Ch 32:30 He blocked up the upper spring of Gihon and brought the water down through a tunnel to the west side of the City of David. And so he succeeded in everything he did.
142Ch 32:31 However, when ambassadors arrived from Babylon to ask about the remarkable events that had taken place in the land, God withdrew from Hezekiah in order to test him and to see what was really in his heart.
142Ch 32:32 The rest of the events in Hezekiah's reign and his acts of devotion are recorded in The Vision of the Prophet Isaiah Son of Amoz, which is included in The Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel.
142Ch 32:33 When Hezekiah died, he was buried in the upper area of the royal cemetery, and all Judah and Jerusalem honored him at his death. And his son Manasseh became the next king.
142Ch 33:1 Manasseh was twelve years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem fifty-five years.
142Ch 33:2 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, following the detestable practices of the pagan nations that the LORD had driven from the land ahead of the Israelites.
142Ch 33:3 He rebuilt the pagan shrines his father, Hezekiah, had broken down. He constructed altars for the images of Baal and set up Asherah poles. He also bowed before all the powers of the heavens and worshiped them.
142Ch 33:4 He built pagan altars in the Temple of the LORD, the place where the LORD had said, "My name will remain in Jerusalem forever."
142Ch 33:5 He built these altars for all the powers of the heavens in both courtyards of the LORD's Temple.
142Ch 33:6 Manasseh also sacrificed his own sons in the fire�� in the valley of Ben-Hinnom. He practiced sorcery, divination, and witchcraft, and he consulted with mediums and psychics. He did much that was evil in the LORD's sight, arousing his anger. / ��Or also made his sons pass through the fire
142Ch 33:7 Manasseh even took a carved idol he had made and set it up in God's Temple, the very place where God had told David and his son Solomon�� "My name will be honored forever in this Temple and in Jerusalem - the city I have chosen from among all the tribes of Israel.
142Ch 33:8 If the Israelites will be careful to obey my commands - all the laws, decrees, and regulations given through Moses - I will not send them into exile from this land that I set aside for your ancestors."
142Ch 33:9 But Manasseh led the people of Judah and Jerusalem to do even more evil than the pagan nations that the LORD had destroyed when the people of Israel entered the land.
142Ch 33:10 The LORD spoke to Manasseh and his people, but they ignored all his warnings.
142Ch 33:11 So the LORD sent the commanders of the Assyrian armies, and they took Manasseh prisoner. They put a ring through his nose, bound him in bronze chains, and led him away to Babylon.
142Ch 33:12 But while in deep distress, Manasseh sought the LORD his God and sincerely humbled himself before the God of his ancestors.
142Ch 33:13 And when he prayed, the LORD listened to him and was moved by his request. So the LORD brought Manasseh back to Jerusalem and to his kingdom. Then Manasseh finally realized that the LORD alone is God!
142Ch 33:14 After this Manasseh rebuilt the outer wall of the City of David, from west of the Gihon Spring in the Kidron Valley to the Fish Gate, and continuing around the hill of Ophel. He built the wall very high. And he stationed his military officers in all of the fortified towns of Judah.
142Ch 33:15 Manasseh also removed the foreign gods and the idol from the LORD's Temple. He tore down all the altars he had built on the hill where the Temple stood and all the altars that were in Jerusalem, and he dumped them outside the city.
142Ch 33:16 Then he restored the altar of the LORD and sacrificed peace offerings and thanksgiving offerings on it. He also encouraged the people of Judah to worship the LORD, the God of Israel.
142Ch 33:17 However, the people still sacrificed at the pagan shrines, though only to the LORD their God.
142Ch 33:18 The rest of the events of Manasseh's reign, his prayer to God, and the words the seers spoke to him in the name of the LORD, the God of Israel, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel.
142Ch 33:19 Manasseh's prayer, the account of the way God answered him, and an account of all his sins and unfaithfulness are recorded in The Record of the Seers��. It includes a list of the locations where he built pagan shrines and set up Asherah poles and idols before he humbled himself and repented. / ��Or The Record of Hozai
142Ch 33:20 When Manasseh died, he was buried in his palace. Then his son Amon became the next king.
142Ch 33:21 Amon was twenty-two years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem two years.
142Ch 33:22 He did what was evil in the LORD's sight, just as his father, Manasseh, had done. He worshiped and sacrificed to all the idols his father had made.
142Ch 33:23 But unlike his father, he did not humble himself before the LORD. Instead, Amon sinned even more.
142Ch 33:24 Then Amon's own officials conspired against him and assassinated him in his palace.
142Ch 33:25 But the people of the land killed all those who had conspired against King Amon, and they made his son Josiah the next king.
142Ch 34:1 Josiah was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem thirty-one years.
142Ch 34:2 He did what was pleasing in the LORD's sight and followed the example of his ancestor David. He did not turn away from doing what was right.
142Ch 34:3 During the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, Josiah began to seek the God of his ancestor David. Then in the twelfth year he began to purify Judah and Jerusalem, destroying all the pagan shrines, the Asherah poles, and the carved idols and cast images.
142Ch 34:4 He ordered that the altars of Baal be demolished and that the incense altars which stood above them be broken down. He also made sure that the Asherah poles, the carved idols, and the cast images were smashed and scattered over the graves of those who had sacrificed to them.
142Ch 34:5 He burned the bones of the pagan priests on their own altars, and so he purified Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:6 He did the same thing in the towns of Manasseh, Ephraim, and Simeon, even as far as Naphtali, and in the regions�� all around them. / ��As in Syriac version. Hebrew reads in their temples, or in their ruins. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
142Ch 34:7 He destroyed the pagan altars and the Asherah poles, and he crushed the idols into dust. He cut down all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel. Finally, he returned to Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:8 In the eighteenth year of his reign, after he had purified the land and the Temple, Josiah appointed Shaphan son of Azaliah, Maaseiah the governor of Jerusalem, and Joah son of Joahaz, the royal historian, to repair the Temple of the LORD his God.
142Ch 34:9 They gave Hilkiah the high priest the money that had been collected by the Levites who served as gatekeepers at the Temple of God. The gifts were brought by people from Manasseh, Ephraim, and from all the remnant of Israel, as well as from all Judah, Benjamin, and the people of Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:10 He entrusted the money to the men assigned to supervise the restoration of the LORD's Temple. Then they paid the workers who did the repairs and renovation of the Temple.
142Ch 34:11 They hired carpenters and builders, who purchased finished stone for the walls and timber for the rafters and beams. They restored what earlier kings of Judah had allowed to fall into ruin.
142Ch 34:12 The workers served faithfully under the leadership of Jahath and Obadiah, Levites of the Merarite clan, and Zechariah and Meshullam, Levites of the Kohathite clan. Other Levites, all of whom were skilled musicians,
142Ch 34:13 were put in charge of the laborers of the various trades. Still others assisted as secretaries, officials, and gatekeepers.
142Ch 34:14 While they were bringing out the money collected at the LORD's Temple, Hilkiah the priest found the Book of the Law of the LORD that was written by Moses.
142Ch 34:15 Hilkiah said to Shaphan the court secretary, "I have found the Book of the Law in the LORD's Temple!" Then Hilkiah gave the scroll to Shaphan.
142Ch 34:16 Shaphan took the scroll to the king and reported, "Your officials are doing everything they were assigned to do.
142Ch 34:17 The money that was collected at the Temple of the LORD has been turned over to the supervisors and workmen."
142Ch 34:18 Shaphan also told the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a scroll." So Shaphan read it to the king.
142Ch 34:19 When the king heard what was written in the Law, he tore his clothes in despair.
142Ch 34:20 Then he gave these orders to Hilkiah, Ahikam son of Shaphan, Acbor son of Micaiah��, Shaphan the court secretary, and Asaiah the king's personal adviser. / ��As in parallel text at 2 Kgs 22.12; Hebrew reads Abdon son of Micah
142Ch 34:21 "Go to the Temple and speak to the LORD for me and for all the remnant of Israel and Judah. Inquire about the words written in the scroll that has been found. For the LORD's great anger has been poured out on us because our ancestors have not obeyed the word of the LORD. We have not been doing everything this scroll says we must do."
142Ch 34:22 So Hilkiah and the other men went to the New Quarter�� of Jerusalem to consult with the prophet Huldah. She was the wife of Shallum son of Tikvah, son of Harhas��, the keeper of the Temple wardrobe. / ��Or the Second Quarter, a newer section of Jerusalem. Hebrew reads the Mishneh ��As in parallel text at 2 Kgs 22.14; Hebrew reads son of Tokhath, son of Hasrah
142Ch 34:23 She said to them, "The LORD, the God of Israel, has spoken! Go back and tell the man who sent you,
142Ch 34:24 'This is what the LORD says�� I am going to bring disaster on this city�� and its people. All the curses written in the scroll that was read to the king of Judah will come true. / ��Hebrew this place; also in 34.27, 28
142Ch 34:25 For my people have abandoned me and offered sacrifices to pagan gods, and I am very angry with them for everything they have done. My anger will be poured out on this place, and it will not be quenched.'
142Ch 34:26 "But go to the king of Judah who sent you to seek the LORD and tell him�� 'This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says concerning the message you have just heard.
142Ch 34:27 You were sorry and humbled yourself before God when you heard his words against this city and its people. You humbled yourself and tore your clothing in despair and wept before me in repentance. And I have indeed heard you, says the LORD.
142Ch 34:28 So I will not send the promised disaster until after you have died and been buried in peace. You yourself will not see the disaster I am going to bring on this city and its people.'" So they took her message back to the king.
142Ch 34:29 Then the king summoned all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:30 And the king went up to the Temple of the LORD with all the people of Judah and Jerusalem, along with the priests and the Levites - all the people from the greatest to the least. There the king read to them the entire Book of the Covenant that had been found in the LORD's Temple.
142Ch 34:31 The king took his place of authority beside the pillar and renewed the covenant in the LORD's presence. He pledged to obey the LORD by keeping all his commands, laws, and decrees with all his heart and soul. He promised to obey all the terms of the covenant that were written in the scroll.
142Ch 34:32 And he required everyone in Jerusalem and the people of Benjamin to make a similar pledge. The people of Jerusalem did so, renewing their covenant with God, the God of their ancestors.
142Ch 34:33 So Josiah removed all detestable idols from the entire land of Israel and required everyone to worship the LORD their God. And throughout the rest of his lifetime, they did not turn away from the LORD, the God of their ancestors.
142Ch 35:1 Then Josiah announced that the Passover of the LORD would be celebrated in Jerusalem, and so the Passover lamb was slaughtered on the fourteenth day of the first month��. / ��This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar was April 5, 622 B.C.
142Ch 35:2 Josiah also assigned the priests to their duties and encouraged them in their work at the Temple of the LORD.
142Ch 35:3 He issued this order to the Levites, who were to teach all Israel and who had been set apart to serve the LORD�� "Put the holy Ark in the Temple that was built by Solomon son of David, the king of Israel. You no longer need to carry it back and forth on your shoulders. Now spend your time serving the LORD your God and his people Israel.
142Ch 35:4 Report for duty according to the family divisions of your ancestors, following the directions of King David of Israel and the directions of his son Solomon.
142Ch 35:5 "Then stand in the sanctuary at the place appointed for your family division and help the families assigned to you as they bring their offerings to the Temple.
142Ch 35:6 Slaughter the Passover lambs, purify yourselves, and prepare to help those who come. Follow all the directions that the LORD gave through Moses."
142Ch 35:7 Then Josiah provided 30,000 lambs and young goats for the people's Passover offerings, along with 3,000 cattle, all from the king's own flocks and herds.
142Ch 35:8 The king's officials also made willing contributions to the people, priests, and Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the administrators of God's Temple, gave the priests 2,600 lambs and young goats and 300 cattle as Passover offerings.
142Ch 35:9 The Levite leaders - Conaniah and his brothers Shemaiah and Nethanel, as well as Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad - gave 5,000 lambs and young goats and 500 cattle to the Levites for their Passover offerings.
142Ch 35:10 When everything was ready for the Passover celebration, the priests and the Levites took their places, organized by their divisions, as the king had commanded.
142Ch 35:11 The Levites then slaughtered the Passover lambs and presented the blood to the priests, who sprinkled the blood on the altar while the Levites prepared the animals.
142Ch 35:12 They divided the burnt offerings among the people by their family groups, so they could offer them to the LORD as prescribed in the Book of Moses. They did the same with the cattle.
142Ch 35:13 Then they roasted the Passover lambs as prescribed; and they boiled the holy offerings in pots, kettles, and pans, and brought them out quickly so the people could eat them.
142Ch 35:14 Afterward the Levites prepared Passover offerings for themselves and for the priests - the descendants of Aaron - because the priests had been busy from morning till night offering the burnt offerings and the fat portions. The Levites took responsibility for all these preparations.
142Ch 35:15 The musicians, descendants of Asaph, were in their assigned places, following the commands that had been given by David, Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun, the king's seer. The gatekeepers guarded the gates and did not need to leave their posts of duty, for their Passover offerings were prepared for them by their fellow Levites.
142Ch 35:16 The entire ceremony for the LORD's Passover was completed that day. All the burnt offerings were sacrificed on the altar of the LORD, as King Josiah had commanded.
142Ch 35:17 All the Israelites present in Jerusalem celebrated Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days.
142Ch 35:18 Never since the time of the prophet Samuel had there been such a Passover. None of the kings of Israel had ever kept a Passover as Josiah did, involving all the priests and Levites, all the people of Jerusalem, and people from all over Judah and Israel.
142Ch 35:19 This Passover celebration took place in the eighteenth year of Josiah's reign.
142Ch 35:20 After Josiah had finished restoring the Temple, King Neco of Egypt led his army up from Egypt to do battle at Carchemish on the Euphrates River, and Josiah and his army marched out to fight him��. / ��Or Josiah went out to meet him
142Ch 35:21 But King Neco sent messengers to Josiah with this message�� "What do you want with me, king of Judah? I have no quarrel with you today! I am on my way to fight another nation, and God has told me to hurry! Do not interfere with God, who is with me, or he will destroy you."
142Ch 35:22 But Josiah refused to listen to Neco, to whom God had indeed spoken, and he would not turn back. Instead, he disguised himself and led his army into battle on the plain of Megiddo.
142Ch 35:23 But the enemy archers hit King Josiah with their arrows and wounded him. He cried out to his men, "Take me from the battle, for I am badly wounded!"
142Ch 35:24 So they lifted Josiah out of his chariot and placed him in another chariot. Then they brought him back to Jerusalem, where he died. He was buried there in the royal cemetery. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned for him.
142Ch 35:25 The prophet Jeremiah composed funeral songs for Josiah, and to this day choirs still sing these sad songs about his death. These songs of sorrow have become a tradition and are recorded in The Book of Laments.
142Ch 35:26 The rest of the events of Josiah's reign and his acts of devotion (carried out according to what was written in the Law of the LORD),
142Ch 35:27 from beginning to end - all are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
142Ch 36:1 Then the people of the land took Josiah's son Jehoahaz and made him the next king in Jerusalem.
142Ch 36:2 Jehoahaz�� was twenty-three years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months. / ��Hebrew Joahaz, a variant spelling of Jehoahaz; also in 36.4
142Ch 36:3 Then he was deposed by the king of Egypt, who demanded that Judah pay 7,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold�� as tribute. / ��Hebrew 100 talents [3,400 kilograms] of silver and 1 talent [34 kilograms] of gold
142Ch 36:4 The king of Egypt then installed Eliakim, the brother of Jehoahaz, as the next king of Judah and Jerusalem, and he changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim. Then Neco took Jehoahaz to Egypt as a prisoner.
142Ch 36:5 Jehoiakim was twenty-five years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years. He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.
142Ch 36:6 Then King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and captured it, and he bound Jehoiakim in bronze chains and led him away to Babylon.
142Ch 36:7 Nebuchadnezzar also took some of the treasures from the Temple of the LORD, and he placed them in his palace�� in Babylon. / ��Or temple
142Ch 36:8 The rest of the events in Jehoiakim's reign, including all the evil things he did and everything found against him, are recorded in The Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. Then his son Jehoiachin became the next king.
142Ch 36:9 Jehoiachin was eighteen�� years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem three months and ten days. Jehoiachin did what was evil in the LORD's sight. / ��As in one Hebrew manuscript, some Greek manuscripts, and Syriac version (see also 2 Kgs 24.8); most Hebrew manuscripts read eight
142Ch 36:10 In the spring of the year�� King Nebuchadnezzar took Jehoiachin to Babylon. Many treasures from the Temple of the LORD were also taken to Babylon at that time. And Nebuchadnezzar installed Jehoiachin's uncle��, Zedekiah, as the next king in Judah and Jerusalem. / ��Hebrew At the turn of the year. The first day of this year in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar was April 13, 597 B.C. ��As in parallel text at 2 Kgs 24.17; Hebrew reads brother, or relative
142Ch 36:11 Zedekiah was twenty-one years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem eleven years.
142Ch 36:12 He did what was evil in the sight of the LORD his God, and he refused to humble himself when the prophet Jeremiah spoke to him directly from the LORD.
142Ch 36:13 He also rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, even though he had taken an oath of loyalty in God's name. Zedekiah was a hard and stubborn man, refusing to turn to the LORD, the God of Israel.
142Ch 36:14 Likewise, all the leaders of the priests and the people became more and more unfaithful. They followed all the pagan practices of the surrounding nations, desecrating the Temple of the LORD that had been consecrated in Jerusalem.
142Ch 36:15 The LORD, the God of their ancestors, repeatedly sent his prophets to warn them, for he had compassion on his people and his Temple.
142Ch 36:16 But the people mocked these messengers of God and despised their words. They scoffed at the prophets until the LORD's anger could no longer be restrained and nothing could be done.
142Ch 36:17 So the LORD brought the king of Babylon against them. The Babylonians�� killed Judah's young men, even chasing after them into the Temple. They had no pity on the people, killing both young men and young women, the old and the infirm. God handed all of them over to Nebuchadnezzar. / ��Or Chaldeans
142Ch 36:18 The king took home to Babylon all the articles, large and small, used in the Temple of God, and the treasures from both the LORD's Temple and from the palace of the king and his officials.
142Ch 36:19 Then his army burned the Temple of God, tore down the walls of Jerusalem, burned all the palaces, and completely destroyed everything of value��. / ��Or destroyed all the valuable articles from the Temple
142Ch 36:20 The few who survived were taken as exiles to Babylon, and they became servants to the king and his sons until the kingdom of Persia came to power.
142Ch 36:21 So the message of the LORD spoken through Jeremiah was fulfilled. The land finally enjoyed its Sabbath rest, lying desolate until the seventy years were fulfilled, just as the prophet had said.
142Ch 36:22 In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia��, the LORD fulfilled the prophecy he had given through Jeremiah��. He stirred the heart of Cyrus to put this proclamation in writing and to send it throughout his kingdom. / ��The first year of Cyrus's reign over Babylon was 538 B.C. ��See Jer 25.11-12; 29.10
142Ch 36:23 "This is what King Cyrus of Persia says�� "The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He has appointed me to build him a Temple at Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Any of you who are the LORD's people may go there for this task. And may the LORD your God be with you!"

15Ezr 1:1 In the first year of King Cyrus of Persia��, the LORD fulfilled the prophecy he had given through Jeremiah��. He stirred the heart of Cyrus to put this proclamation in writing and to send it throughout his kingdom. / ��The first year of Cyrus's reign over Babylon was 538 B.C. ��See Jer 25.11-12; 29.10
15Ezr 1:2 "This is what King Cyrus of Persia says�� "The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth. He has appointed me to build him a Temple at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.
15Ezr 1:3 Any of you who are his people may go to Jerusalem in Judah to rebuild this Temple of the LORD, the God of Israel, who lives in Jerusalem. And may your God be with you!
15Ezr 1:4 Wherever this Jewish remnant is found, let their neighbors contribute toward their expenses by giving them silver and gold, supplies for the journey, and livestock, as well as a voluntary offering for the Temple of God in Jerusalem."
15Ezr 1:5 Then God stirred the hearts of the priests and Levites and the leaders of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin to go to Jerusalem to rebuild the Temple of the LORD.
15Ezr 1:6 And all their neighbors assisted by giving them articles of silver and gold, supplies for the journey, and livestock. They gave them many valuable gifts in addition to all the voluntary offerings.
15Ezr 1:7 King Cyrus himself brought out the articles that King Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the LORD's Temple in Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his own gods.
15Ezr 1:8 Cyrus directed Mithredath, the treasurer of Persia, to count these items and present them to Sheshbazzar, the leader of the exiles returning to Judah��. / ��Hebrew Sheshbazzar, the prince of Judah
15Ezr 1:9 This is a list of the items that were returned�� gold basins 30, silver basins 1,000, silver incense burners�� 29, / ��The meaning of this Hebrew word is uncertain

15Ezr 2:59 Another group returned at this time from the towns of Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Kerub, Addan, and Immer. However, they could not prove that they or their families were descendants of Israel.
15Ezr 2:60 This group included the families of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda - a total of 652 people.
15Ezr 2:61 Three families of priests - Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai - also returned. (This Barzillai had married a woman who was a descendant of Barzillai of Gilead, and he had taken her family name.)
15Ezr 2:62 They searched for their names in the genealogical records, but they were not found, so they were disqualified from serving as priests.
15Ezr 2:63 The governor told them not to eat the priests' share of food from the sacrifices until a priest could consult the LORD about the matter by using the Urim and Thummim - the sacred lots.
15Ezr 2:64 So a total of 42,360 people returned to Judah,
15Ezr 2:65 in addition to 7,337 servants and 200 singers, both men and women.
15Ezr 2:66 They took with them 736 horses, 245 mules,
15Ezr 2:67 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
15Ezr 2:68 When they arrived at the Temple of the LORD in Jerusalem, some of the family leaders made voluntary offerings toward the rebuilding of God's Temple on its original site,
15Ezr 2:69 and each leader gave as much as he could. The total of their gifts came to 61,000 gold coins��, 6,250 pounds�� of silver, and 100 robes for the priests. / ��Hebrew 61,000 darics of gold, about 1,100 pounds or 500 kilograms in weight ��Hebrew 5,000 minas [3,000 kilograms]

15Ezr 3:2 Then Jeshua son of Jehozadak�� joined his fellow priests and Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel with his family in rebuilding the altar of the God of Israel. They wanted to sacrifice burnt offerings on it, as instructed in the Law of Moses, the man of God. / ��Hebrew Jozadak, a variant spelling of Jehozadak; also in 3.8
15Ezr 3:3 Even though the people were afraid of the local residents, they rebuilt the altar at its old site. Then they began to sacrifice burnt offerings on the altar to the LORD each morning and evening.
15Ezr 3:4 They celebrated the Festival of Shelters as prescribed in the Law, sacrificing the number of burnt offerings specified for each day of the festival.
15Ezr 3:5 They also offered the regular burnt offerings and the offerings required for the new moon celebrations and the annual festivals as prescribed by the LORD. The people also gave voluntary offerings to the LORD.
15Ezr 3:6 Fifteen days before the Festival of Shelters began��, the priests had begun to sacrifice burnt offerings to the LORD. This was even before they had started to lay the foundation of the LORD's Temple. / ��Hebrew On the first day of the seventh month. This day in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred in September or October. The Festival of Shelters began on the fifteenth day of the seventh month
15Ezr 3:7 Then the people hired masons and carpenters and bought cedar logs from the people of Tyre and Sidon, paying them with food, wine, and olive oil. The logs were brought down from the Lebanon mountains and floated along the coast of the Mediterranean Sea�� to Joppa, for King Cyrus had given permission for this. / ��Hebrew the sea
15Ezr 3:8 The construction of the Temple of God began in midspring��, during the second year after they arrived in Jerusalem. The work force was made up of everyone who had returned from exile, including Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel, Jeshua son of Jehozadak and his fellow priests, and all the Levites. The Levites who were twenty years old or older were put in charge of rebuilding the LORD's Temple. / ��Hebrew in the second month. This month in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred within the months of April and May 536 B.C.
15Ezr 3:9 The workers at the Temple of God were supervised by Jeshua with his sons and relatives, and Kadmiel and his sons, all descendants of Hodaviah��. They were helped in this task by the Levites of the family of Henadad. / ��Hebrew sons of Judah (i.e., bene Yehudah). Bene might also be read here as the proper name Binnui; Yehudah is probably another name for Hodaviah. Compare 2.40; Neh 7.43; 1 Esdras 5.58.
15Ezr 3:10 When the builders completed the foundation of the LORD's Temple, the priests put on their robes and took their places to blow their trumpets. And the Levites, descendants of Asaph, clashed their cymbals to praise the LORD, just as King David had prescribed.
15Ezr 3:11 With praise and thanks, they sang this song to the LORD�� "He is so good! His faithful love for Israel endures forever!" Then all the people gave a great shout, praising the LORD because the foundation of the LORD's Temple had been laid.
15Ezr 3:12 But many of the older priests, Levites, and other leaders who had seen the first Temple wept aloud when they saw the new Temple's foundation. The others, however, were shouting for joy.
15Ezr 3:13 The joyful shouting and weeping mingled together in a loud noise that could be heard far in the distance.
15Ezr 4:1 The enemies of Judah and Benjamin heard that the exiles were rebuilding a Temple to the LORD, the God of Israel.
15Ezr 4:2 So they approached Zerubbabel and the other leaders and said, "Let us build with you, for we worship your God just as you do. We have sacrificed to him ever since King Esarhaddon of Assyria brought us here."
15Ezr 4:3 But Zerubbabel, Jeshua, and the other leaders of Israel replied, "You may have no part in this work. We alone will build the Temple for the LORD, the God of Israel, just as King Cyrus of Persia commanded us."
15Ezr 4:4 Then the local residents tried to discourage and frighten the people of Judah to keep them from their work.
15Ezr 4:5 They bribed agents to work against them and to frustrate their plans. This went on during the entire reign of King Cyrus of Persia and lasted until King Darius of Persia took the throne��. / ��Darius reigned 521-486 B.C.
15Ezr 4:6 Years later when Xerxes�� began his reign, the enemies of Judah wrote a letter of accusation against the people of Judah and Jerusalem. / ��Hebrew Ahasuerus, another name for Xerxes. He reigned 486-465 B.C.
15Ezr 4:7 Even later, during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia��, the enemies of Judah, led by Bishlam, Mithredath, and Tabeel, sent a letter to Artaxerxes in the Aramaic language, and it was translated for the king. / ��Artaxerxes reigned 465-424 B.C.
15Ezr 4:8 ��Rehum the governor and Shimshai the court secretary wrote the letter, telling King Artaxerxes about the situation in Jerusalem. / ��The original text of 4.8-6.18 is in Aramaic
15Ezr 4:9 They greeted the king for all their colleagues - the judges and local leaders, the people of Tarpel, the Persians, the Babylonians, and the people of Erech and Susa (that is, Elam).
15Ezr 4:10 They also sent greetings from the rest of the people whom the great and noble Ashurbanipal�� had deported and relocated in Samaria and throughout the neighboring lands of the province west of the Euphrates River�� / ��Aramaic the province beyond the river; also in 4.11, 16, 17, 20. / ��Aramaic Osnappar, another name for Ashurbanipal
15Ezr 4:11 This is a copy of their letter�� "To King Artaxerxes, from your loyal subjects in the province west of the Euphrates River.
15Ezr 4:12 "The king should know that the Jews who came here to Jerusalem from Babylon are rebuilding this rebellious and evil city. They have already laid the foundation and will soon finish its walls.
15Ezr 4:13 And the king should know that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, it will be much to your disadvantage, for the Jews will then refuse to pay their tribute, customs, and tolls to you.
15Ezr 4:14 "Since we are your loyal subjects�� and do not want to see the king dishonored in this way, we have sent the king this information. / ��Aramaic Since we eat the salt of the palace
15Ezr 4:15 We suggest that a search be made in your ancestors' records, where you will discover what a rebellious city this has been in the past. In fact, it was destroyed because of its long and troublesome history of revolt against the kings and countries who controlled it.
15Ezr 4:16 We declare to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls are completed, the province west of the Euphrates River will be lost to you."
15Ezr 4:17 Then King Artaxerxes sent this reply�� "To Rehum the governor, Shimshai the court secretary, and their colleagues living in Samaria and throughout the province west of the Euphrates River. Greetings.
15Ezr 4:18 "The letter you sent has been translated and read to me.
15Ezr 4:19 I ordered a search of the records and have found that Jerusalem has indeed been a hotbed of insurrection against many kings. In fact, rebellion and revolt are normal there!
15Ezr 4:20 Powerful kings have ruled over Jerusalem and the entire province west of the Euphrates River, receiving tribute, customs, and tolls.
15Ezr 4:21 Therefore, issue orders to have these men stop their work. That city must not be rebuilt except at my express command.
15Ezr 4:22 Be diligent, and don't neglect this matter, for we must not permit the situation to harm the king's interests."
15Ezr 4:23 When this letter from King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum, Shimshai, and their colleagues, they hurried to Jerusalem. Then, with a show of strength, they forced the Jews to stop building.
15Ezr 4:24 So the work on the Temple of God in Jerusalem had stopped, and it remained at a standstill until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia��. / ��The second year of Darius's reign was 520 B.C. The narrative started in 4.1-5 is resumed at verse 24
15Ezr 5:1 At that time the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo prophesied to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem. They prophesied in the name of the God of Israel who was over them.
15Ezr 5:2 Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua son of Jehozadak�� responded by starting again to rebuild the Temple of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were with them and helped them. / ��Aramaic Jozadak, a variant spelling of Jehozadak
15Ezr 5:3 But Tattenai, governor of the province west of the Euphrates River��, and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues soon arrived in Jerusalem and asked, "Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and restore this structure?" / ��Aramaic the province beyond the river; also in 5.6
15Ezr 5:4 They also asked for the names of all the men working on the Temple.
15Ezr 5:5 But because their God was watching over them, the leaders of the Jews were not prevented from building until a report was sent to Darius and he returned his decision.
15Ezr 5:6 This is a copy of the letter that Tattenai the governor, Shethar-bozenai, and the other officials of the province west of the Euphrates River sent to King Darius.
15Ezr 5:7 "To King Darius. Greetings.
15Ezr 5:8 "The king should know that we went to the construction site of the Temple of the great God in the province of Judah. It is being rebuilt with specially prepared stones, and timber is being laid in its walls. The work is going forward with great energy and success.
15Ezr 5:9 "We asked the leaders, 'Who gave you permission to rebuild this Temple and restore this structure?'
15Ezr 5:10 And we demanded their names so that we could tell you who the leaders were.
15Ezr 5:11 "This was their answer�� 'We are the servants of the God of heaven and earth, and we are rebuilding the Temple that was built here many years ago by a great king of Israel.
15Ezr 5:12 But because our ancestors angered the God of heaven, he abandoned them to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon��, who destroyed this Temple and exiled the people to Babylonia. / ��Aramaic Nebuchadnezzar the Chaldean
15Ezr 5:13 However, King Cyrus of Babylon��, during the first year of his reign, issued a decree that the Temple of God should be rebuilt. / ��King Cyrus of Persia is here identified as the king of Babylon because Persia had conquered the Babylonian Empire
15Ezr 5:14 King Cyrus returned the gold and silver cups that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Temple of God in Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of Babylon. These cups were taken from that temple and presented to a man named Sheshbazzar, whom King Cyrus appointed as governor of Judah.
15Ezr 5:15 The king instructed him to return the cups to their place in Jerusalem and to rebuild the Temple of God there on its original site.
15Ezr 5:16 So this Sheshbazzar came and laid the foundations of the Temple of God in Jerusalem. The people have been working on it ever since, though it is not yet completed.'
15Ezr 5:17 "Therefore, if it pleases the king, we request that a search be made in the royal archives of Babylon to discover whether King Cyrus ever issued a decree to rebuild God's Temple in Jerusalem. And then let the king send us his decision in this matter."
15Ezr 6:1 So King Darius issued orders that a search be made in the Babylonian archives, which were stored in the treasury.
15Ezr 6:2 But it was at the fortress at Ecbatana in the province of Media that a scroll was found. This is what it said.
15Ezr 6:3 "Memorandum�� "In the first year of King Cyrus's reign, a decree was sent out concerning the Temple of God at Jerusalem. "Let the Temple be rebuilt on the site where Jews used to offer their sacrifices, using the original foundations. Its height will be ninety feet, and its width will be ninety feet��. / ��Aramaic Its height will be 60 cubits [27.6 meters], and its width will be 60 cubits. It is commonly held that this verse should be emended to read�� "Its height will be 30 cubits [45 feet, or 13.8 meters], its length will be 60 cubits [90 feet, or 27.6 meters], and its width will be 20 meters [30 feet, or 9.2 meters]"; compare 1 Kgs 6.2. The emendation regarding the width is supported by the Syriac version
15Ezr 6:4 Every three layers of specially prepared stones will be topped by a layer of timber. All expenses will be paid by the royal treasury.
15Ezr 6:5 Furthermore, the gold and silver cups, which were taken to Babylon by Nebuchadnezzar from the Temple of God in Jerusalem, must be returned to Jerusalem and put back where they belong. Let them be taken back to the Temple of God."
15Ezr 6:6 So King Darius sent this message�� "Now therefore, Tattenai, governor of the province west of the Euphrates River��, and Shethar-bozenai, and your colleagues and other officials west of the Euphrates River - stay away from there! / ��Aramaic the province beyond the river; also in 6.6b, 8, 13
15Ezr 6:7 Do not disturb the construction of the Temple of God. Let it be rebuilt on its original site, and do not hinder the governor of Judah and the elders of the Jews in their work.
15Ezr 6:8 "Moreover, I hereby decree that you are to help these elders of the Jews as they rebuild this Temple of God. You must pay the full construction costs, without delay, from my taxes collected in the province west of the Euphrates River so that the work will not be interrupted.
15Ezr 6:9 "Give the priests in Jerusalem whatever is needed in the way of young bulls, rams, and male lambs for the burnt offerings presented to the God of heaven. And without fail, provide them with as much wheat, salt, wine, and olive oil as they need each day.
15Ezr 6:10 Then they will be able to offer acceptable sacrifices to the God of heaven and pray for the welfare of the king and his sons.
15Ezr 6:11 "Those who violate this decree in any way will have a beam pulled from their house. Then they will be tied to it and flogged, and their house will be reduced to a pile of rubble��. / ��Aramaic a dunghill
15Ezr 6:12 May the God who has chosen the city of Jerusalem as the place to honor his name destroy any king or nation that violates this command and destroys this Temple."I, Darius, have issued this decree. Let it be obeyed with all diligence."
15Ezr 6:13 Tattenai, governor of the province west of the Euphrates River, and Shethar-bozenai and their colleagues complied at once with the command of King Darius.
15Ezr 6:14 So the Jewish elders continued their work, and they were greatly encouraged by the preaching of the prophets Haggai and Zechariah son of Iddo. The Temple was finally finished, as had been commanded by the God of Israel and decreed by Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, the kings of Persia.
15Ezr 6:15 The Temple was completed on March 12��, during the sixth year of King Darius's reign. / ��Aramaic on the third day of the month Adar, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. A number of events in Ezra can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Persian records and related accurately to our modern calendar. This day was March 12, 515 B.C.
15Ezr 6:16 The Temple of God was then dedicated with great joy by the people of Israel, the priests, the Levites, and the rest of the people who had returned from exile.
15Ezr 6:17 During the dedication ceremony for the Temple of God, 100 young bulls, 200 rams, and 400 male lambs were sacrificed. And 12 male goats were presented as a sin offering for the twelve tribes of Israel.
15Ezr 6:18 Then the priests and Levites were divided into their various divisions to serve at the Temple of God in Jerusalem, as prescribed in the Book of Moses.
15Ezr 6:19 On April 21�� the returned exiles celebrated Passover. / ��Hebrew On the fourteenth day of the first month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was April 21, 515 B.C.; also see note on 6.15
15Ezr 6:20 The priests and Levites had purified themselves and were ceremonially clean. So they slaughtered the Passover lamb for all the returned exiles, for their fellow priests, and for themselves.
15Ezr 6:21 The Passover meal was eaten by the people of Israel who had returned from exile and by the others in the land who had turned from their immoral customs to worship the LORD, the God of Israel.
15Ezr 6:22 Then they celebrated the Festival of Unleavened Bread for seven days. There was great joy throughout the land because the LORD had caused the king of Assyria�� to be favorable to them, so that he helped them to rebuild the Temple of God, the God of Israel. / ��King Darius of Persia is here identified as the king of Assyria because Persia had conquered the Babylonian Empire, which included the earlier Assyrian Empire
15Ezr 7:1 Many years later, during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia��, there was a man named Ezra. He was the son�� of Seraiah, son of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, / ��Artaxerxes reigned 465-424 B.C. ��Or descendant; see 1 Chr 6.14
15Ezr 7:2 son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub,
15Ezr 7:3 son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son�� of Meraioth, / ��Or descendant; see 1 Chr 6.6-10
15Ezr 7:4 son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki,
15Ezr 7:5 son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the high priest��. / ��Or the first priest
15Ezr 7:6 This Ezra was a scribe who was well versed in the Law of Moses, which the LORD, the God of Israel, had given to the people of Israel. He came up to Jerusalem from Babylon, and the king gave him everything he asked for, because the gracious hand of the LORD his God was on him.
15Ezr 7:7 Some of the people of Israel, as well as some of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, and Temple servants, traveled up to Jerusalem with him in the seventh year of King Artaxerxes' reign.
15Ezr 7:8 Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in August�� of that year. / ��Hebrew in the fifth month. This month in the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred within the months of August and September 458 B.C.
15Ezr 7:9 He had arranged to leave Babylon on April 8, the first day of the new year��, and he arrived at Jerusalem on August 4��, for the gracious hand of his God was on him. / ��Hebrew on the first day of the first month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar.

15Ezr 7:10 This was because Ezra had determined to study and obey the Law of the LORD and to teach those decrees and regulations to the people of Israel.
15Ezr 7:11 King Artaxerxes had given a copy of the following letter to Ezra, the priest and scribe who studied and taught the commands and decrees of the LORD to Israel.
15Ezr 7:12 ��"From Artaxerxes, the king of kings, to Ezra the priest, the teacher of the law of the God of heaven. Greetings / ��The original text of 7.12-26 is in Aramaic
15Ezr 7:13 "I decree that any of the people of Israel in my kingdom, including the priests and Levites, may volunteer to return to Jerusalem with you.
15Ezr 7:14 I and my council of seven hereby instruct you to conduct an inquiry into the situation in Judah and Jerusalem, based on your God's law, which is in your hand.
15Ezr 7:15 We also commission you to take with you silver and gold, which we are freely presenting as an offering to the God of Israel who lives in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 7:16 "Furthermore, you are to take any silver and gold that you may obtain from the province of Babylon, as well as the voluntary offerings of the people and the priests that are presented for the Temple of their God in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 7:17 These donations are to be used specifically for the purchase of bulls, rams, male lambs, and the appropriate grain offerings and liquid offerings, all of which will be offered on the altar of the Temple of your God in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 7:18 Any silver and gold that is left over may be used in whatever way you and your colleagues feel is the will of your God.
15Ezr 7:19 "But as for the cups we are entrusting to you for the service of the Temple of your God, deliver them all to the God of Jerusalem.
15Ezr 7:20 If you need anything else for your God's Temple or for any similar needs, you may take it from the royal treasury.
15Ezr 7:21 "I, Artaxerxes the king, hereby send this decree to all the treasurers in the province west of the Euphrates River�磺 'You are to give Ezra, the priest and teacher of the law of the God of heaven, whatever he requests of you. / ��Aramaic the province beyond the river; also in 7.25

15Ezr 7:23 Be careful to provide whatever the God of heaven demands for his Temple, for why should we risk bringing God's anger against the realm of the king and his sons?
15Ezr 7:24 I also decree that no priest, Levite, singer, gatekeeper, Temple servant, or other worker in this Temple of God will be required to pay tribute, customs, or tolls of any kind.'
15Ezr 7:25 "And you, Ezra, are to use the wisdom your God has given you to appoint magistrates and judges who know your God's laws to govern all the people in the province west of the Euphrates River. Teach the law to anyone who does not know it.
15Ezr 7:26 Anyone who refuses to obey the law of your God and the law of the king will be punished immediately, either by death, banishment, confiscation of goods, or imprisonment."
15Ezr 7:27 Praise the LORD, the God of our ancestors, who made the king want to beautify the Temple of the LORD in Jerusalem!
15Ezr 7:28 And praise him for demonstrating such unfailing love to me by honoring me before the king, his council, and all his mighty nobles! I felt encouraged because the gracious hand of the LORD my God was on me. And I gathered some of the leaders of Israel to return with me to Jerusalem.
15Ezr 8:1 Here is a list of the family leaders and the genealogies of those who came with me from Babylon during the reign of King Artaxerxes.
15Ezr 8:2 From the family of Phinehas�� Gershom. From the family of Ithamar�� Daniel. From the family of David�� Hattush,

15Ezr 8:15 I assembled the exiles at the Ahava Canal, and we camped there for three days while I went over the lists of the people and the priests who had arrived. I found that not one Levite had volunteered to come along.
15Ezr 8:16 So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were leaders of the people. I also sent for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of discernment.
15Ezr 8:17 I sent them to Iddo, the leader of the Levites at Casiphia, to ask him and his relatives and the Temple servants to send us ministers for the Temple of God at Jerusalem.
15Ezr 8:18 Since the gracious hand of our God was on us, they sent us a man named Sherebiah, along with eighteen of his sons and brothers. He was a very astute man and a descendant of Mahli, who was a descendant of Levi son of Israel��. / ��Israel is the name that God gave to Jacob
15Ezr 8:19 They also sent Hashabiah, together with Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari, and twenty of his sons and brothers,
15Ezr 8:20 and 220 Temple servants. The Temple servants were assistants to the Levites - a group of Temple workers first instituted by King David and his officials. They were all listed by name.
15Ezr 8:21 And there by the Ahava Canal, I gave orders for all of us to fast and humble ourselves before our God. We prayed that he would give us a safe journey and protect us, our children, and our goods as we traveled.
15Ezr 8:22 For I was ashamed to ask the king for soldiers and horsemen�� to accompany us and protect us from enemies along the way. After all, we had told the king, "Our God's hand of protection is on all who worship him, but his fierce anger rages against those who abandon him." / ��Or charioteers
15Ezr 8:23 So we fasted and earnestly prayed that our God would take care of us, and he heard our prayer.
15Ezr 8:24 I appointed twelve leaders of the priests - Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten other priests - 
15Ezr 8:25 to be in charge of transporting the silver, the gold, the gold bowls, and the other items that the king, his council, his officials, and all the people of Israel had presented for the Temple of God.
15Ezr 8:26 I weighed the treasure as I gave it to them and found the totals to be as follows�� 24 tons�� of silver, 7,500 pounds�� of silver articles, 7,500 pounds of gold, / ��Hebrew 650 talents [22 metric tons] ��Hebrew 100 talents [3,400 kilograms]; also in 8.26c
15Ezr 8:27 20 gold bowls, equal in value to 1,000 gold coins��, 2 fine articles of polished bronze, as precious as gold. / ��Hebrew 1,000 darics, about 19 pounds or 8.6 kilograms in weight
15Ezr 8:28 And I said to these priests, "You and these treasures have been set apart as holy to the LORD. This silver and gold is a voluntary offering to the LORD, the God of our ancestors.
15Ezr 8:29 Guard these treasures well until you present them to the leading priests, the Levites, and the leaders of Israel, who will weigh them at the storerooms of the LORD's Temple in Jerusalem."
15Ezr 8:30 So the priests and the Levites accepted the task of transporting these treasures of silver and gold to the Temple of our God in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 8:31 We broke camp at the Ahava Canal on April 19�� and started off to Jerusalem. And the gracious hand of our God protected us and saved us from enemies and bandits along the way. / ��Hebrew on the twelfth day of the first month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was April 19, 458 B.C.; also see note on 6.15
15Ezr 8:32 So we arrived safely in Jerusalem, where we rested for three days.
15Ezr 8:33 On the fourth day after our arrival, the silver, gold, and other valuables were weighed at the Temple of our God and entrusted to Meremoth son of Uriah the priest and to Eleazar son of Phinehas, along with Jozabad son of Jeshua and Noadiah son of Binnui - both of whom were Levites.
15Ezr 8:34 Everything was accounted for by number and weight, and the total weight was officially recorded.
15Ezr 8:35 Then the exiles who had come out of captivity sacrificed burnt offerings to the God of Israel. They presented twelve bulls for all the people of Israel, as well as ninety-six rams and seventy-seven male lambs. They also offered twelve male goats as a sin offering. All this was given as a burnt offering to the LORD.
15Ezr 8:36 The king's decrees were delivered to his highest officers and the governors of the province west of the Euphrates River��, who then cooperated by supporting the people and the Temple of God. / ��Hebrew the province beyond the river
15Ezr 9:1 When these things had been done, the Jewish leaders came to me and said, "Many of the people of Israel, and even some of the priests and Levites, have not kept themselves separate from the other peoples living in the land. They have taken up the detestable practices of the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Jebusites, Ammonites, Moabites, Egyptians, and Amorites.
15Ezr 9:2 For the men of Israel have married women from these people and have taken them as wives for their sons. So the holy race has become polluted by these mixed marriages. Worse yet, the leaders and officials have led the way in this outrage."
15Ezr 9:3 When I heard this, I tore my cloak and my shirt, pulled hair from my head and beard, and sat down utterly shocked.
15Ezr 9:4 Then all who trembled at the words of the God of Israel came and sat with me because of this outrage committed by the returned exiles. And I sat there utterly appalled until the time of the evening sacrifice.
15Ezr 9:5 At the time of the sacrifice, I stood up from where I had sat in mourning with my clothes torn. I fell to my knees and lifted my hands to the LORD my God.
15Ezr 9:6 I prayed, "O my God, I am utterly ashamed; I blush to lift up my face to you. For our sins are piled higher than our heads, and our guilt has reached to the heavens.
15Ezr 9:7 From the days of our ancestors until now, we have been steeped in sin. That is why we and our kings and our priests have been at the mercy of the pagan kings of the land. We have been killed, captured, robbed, and disgraced, just as we are today.
15Ezr 9:8 "But now we have been given a brief moment of grace, for the LORD our God has allowed a few of us to survive as a remnant. He has given us security in this holy place. Our God has brightened our eyes and granted us some relief from our slavery.
15Ezr 9:9 For we were slaves, but in his unfailing love our God did not abandon us in our slavery. Instead, he caused the kings of Persia to treat us favorably. He revived us so we could rebuild the Temple of our God and repair its ruins. He has given us a protective wall in Judah and Jerusalem.
15Ezr 9:10 "And now, O our God, what can we say after all of this? For once again we have abandoned your commands!
15Ezr 9:11 Your servants the prophets warned us when they said, 'The land you are entering to possess is totally defiled by the detestable practices of the people living there. From one end to the other, the land is filled with corruption.
15Ezr 9:12 Don't let your daughters marry their sons! Don't take their daughters as wives for your sons. Don't ever promote the peace and prosperity of those nations. If you follow these instructions, you will be strong and will enjoy the good things the land produces, and you will leave this prosperity to your children forever.'
15Ezr 9:13 "Now we are being punished because of our wickedness and our great guilt. But we have actually been punished far less than we deserve, for you, our God, have allowed some of us to survive as a remnant.
15Ezr 9:14 But even so, we are again breaking your commands and intermarrying with people who do these detestable things. Won't your anger be enough to destroy us, so that even this little remnant no longer survives?
15Ezr 9:15 O LORD, God of Israel, you are just. We come before you in our guilt as nothing but an escaped remnant, though in such a condition none of us can stand in your presence."
15Ezr 10:1 While Ezra prayed and made this confession, weeping and lying face down on the ground in front of the Temple of God, a very large crowd of people from Israel - men, women, and children - gathered and wept bitterly with him.
15Ezr 10:2 Then Shecaniah son of Jehiel, a descendant of Elam, said to Ezra, "We have been unfaithful to our God, for we have married these pagan women of the land. But in spite of this there is hope for Israel.
15Ezr 10:3 Let us now make a covenant with our God to divorce our pagan wives and to send them away with their children. We will follow the advice given by you and by the others who respect the commands of our God. Let it be done according to the Law of God.
15Ezr 10:4 Get up, for it is your duty to tell us how to proceed in setting things straight. We are behind you, so be strong and take action."
15Ezr 10:5 So Ezra stood up and demanded that the leaders of the priests and the Levites and all the people of Israel swear that they would do as Shecaniah had said. And they all swore a solemn oath.
15Ezr 10:6 Then Ezra left the front of the Temple of God and went to the room of Jehohanan son of Eliashib. He spent the night�� there without eating or drinking anything. He was still in mourning because of the unfaithfulness of the returned exiles. / ��As in parallel text at 1 Esdras 9.2; Hebrew reads He went
15Ezr 10:7 Then a proclamation was made throughout Judah and Jerusalem that all the exiles should come to Jerusalem.
15Ezr 10:8 Those who failed to come within three days would, if the leaders and elders so decided, forfeit all their property and be expelled from the assembly of the exiles.
15Ezr 10:9 Within three days, all the people of Judah and Benjamin had gathered in Jerusalem. This took place on December 19��, and all the people were sitting in the square before the Temple of God. They were trembling both because of the seriousness of the matter and because it was raining. / ��Hebrew on the twentieth day of the ninth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was December 19, 458 B.C.; also see note on 6.15
15Ezr 10:10 Then Ezra the priest stood and said to them�� "You have committed a terrible sin. By marrying pagan women, you have increased Israel's guilt.
15Ezr 10:11 So now confess your sin to the LORD, the God of your ancestors, and do what he demands. Separate yourselves from the people of the land and from these pagan women."
15Ezr 10:12 Then the whole assembly raised their voices and answered, "Yes, you are right; we must do as you say!
15Ezr 10:13 Then they added, "This isn't something that can be done in a day or two, for many of us are involved in this extremely sinful affair. And this is the rainy season, so we cannot stay out here much longer.
15Ezr 10:14 Let our leaders act on behalf of us all. Let everyone who has a pagan wife come at a scheduled time, accompanied by the leaders and judges of his city, so that the fierce anger of our God concerning this affair may be turned away from us."
15Ezr 10:15 Only Jonathan son of Asahel and Jahzeiah son of Tikvah opposed this course of action, and they were supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite.
15Ezr 10:16 So this was the plan they followed. Ezra selected leaders to represent their families, designating each of the representatives by name. On December 29��, the leaders sat down to investigate the matter. / ��Hebrew On the first day of the tenth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar.

16Neh 1:1 These are the memoirs of Nehemiah son of Hacaliah. In late autumn, in the month of Kislev, in the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes' reign��, I was at the fortress of Susa. / ��Hebrew In the month of Kislev of the twentieth year. A number of dates in the book of Nehemiah can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Persian records and related accurately to our modern calendar. This month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred within the months of November and December 446 B.C. The twentieth year probably refers to the reign of King Artaxerxes I; compare 2.1; 5.14
16Neh 1:2 Hanani, one of my brothers, came to visit me with some other men who had just arrived from Judah. I asked them about the Jews who had returned there from captivity and about how things were going in Jerusalem.
16Neh 1:3 They said to me, "Things are not going well for those who returned to the province of Judah. They are in great trouble and disgrace. The wall of Jerusalem has been torn down, and the gates have been destroyed by fire."
16Neh 1:4 When I heard this, I sat down and wept. In fact, for days I mourned, fasted, and prayed to the God of heaven.
16Neh 1:5 Then I said, "O LORD, God of heaven, the great and awesome God who keeps his covenant of unfailing love with those who love him and obey his commands,
16Neh 1:6 listen to my prayer! Look down and see me praying night and day for your people Israel. I confess that we have sinned against you. Yes, even my own family and I have sinned!
16Neh 1:7 We have sinned terribly by not obeying the commands, decrees, and regulations that you gave us through your servant Moses.
16Neh 1:8 "Please remember what you told your servant Moses�� 'If you are unfaithful to me, I will scatter you among the nations.
16Neh 1:9 But if you return to me and obey my commands and live by them, then even if you are exiled to the ends of the earth, I will bring you back to the place I have chosen for my name to be honored.'
16Neh 1:10 "The people you rescued by your great power and strong hand are your servants.
16Neh 1:11 O Lord, please hear my prayer! Listen to the prayers of those of us who delight in honoring you. Please grant me success today by making the king favorable to me��. Put it into his heart to be kind to me." In those days I was the king's cup-bearer. / ��Hebrew today in the sight of this man
16Neh 2:1 Early the following spring, in the month of Nisan��, during the twentieth year of King Artaxerxes' reign, I was serving the king his wine. I had never before appeared sad in his presence. / ��Hebrew In the month of Nisan. This month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred within the months of April and May 445 B.C.
16Neh 2:2 So the king asked me, "Why are you looking so sad? You don't look sick to me. You must be deeply troubled." Then I was terrified,
16Neh 2:3 but I replied, "Long live the king! How can I not be sad? For the city where my ancestors are buried is in ruins, and the gates have been destroyed by fire."
16Neh 2:4 The king asked, "Well, how can I help you?" With a prayer to the God of heaven,
16Neh 2:5 I replied, "If it please the king, and if you are pleased with me, your servant, send me to Judah to rebuild the city where my ancestors are buried."
16Neh 2:6 The king, with the queen sitting beside him, asked, "How long will you be gone? When will you return?" After I told him how long I would be gone, the king agreed to my request.
16Neh 2:7 I also said to the king, "If it please the king, let me have letters addressed to the governors of the province west of the Euphrates River��, instructing them to let me travel safely through their territories on my way to Judah. / ��Hebrew the province beyond the river; also in 2.9
16Neh 2:8 And please give me a letter addressed to Asaph, the manager of the king's forest, instructing him to give me timber. I will need it to make beams for the gates of the Temple fortress, for the city walls, and for a house for myself." And the king granted these requests, because the gracious hand of God was on me.
16Neh 2:9 When I came to the governors of the province west of the Euphrates River, I delivered the king's letters to them. The king, I should add, had sent along army officers and horsemen�� to protect me. / ��Or charioteers
16Neh 2:10 But when Sanballat the Horonite and Tobiah the Ammonite official heard of my arrival, they were very displeased that someone had come to help the people of Israel.
16Neh 2:11 So I arrived in Jerusalem. Three days later,
16Neh 2:12 I slipped out during the night, taking only a few others with me. I had not told anyone about the plans God had put in my heart for Jerusalem. We took no pack animals with us except the donkey I was riding.
16Neh 2:13 After dark I went out through the Valley Gate, past the Jackal's Well��, and over to the Dung Gate to inspect the broken walls and burned gates. / ��Or Serpent's Well
16Neh 2:14 Then I went to the Fountain Gate and to the King's Pool, but my donkey couldn't get through the rubble.
16Neh 2:15 So, though it was still dark, I went up the Kidron Valley�� instead, inspecting the wall before I turned back and entered again at the Valley Gate. / ��Hebrew the valley
16Neh 2:16 The city officials did not know I had been out there or what I was doing, for I had not yet said anything to anyone about my plans. I had not yet spoken to the Jewish leaders - the priests, the nobles, the officials, or anyone else in the administration.
16Neh 2:17 But now I said to them, "You know very well what trouble we are in. Jerusalem lies in ruins, and its gates have been destroyed by fire. Let us rebuild the wall of Jerusalem and end this disgrace!"
16Neh 2:18 Then I told them about how the gracious hand of God had been on me, and about my conversation with the king.They replied at once, "Yes, let's rebuild the wall!" So they began the good work.
16Neh 2:19 But when Sanballat, Tobiah, and Geshem the Arab heard of our plan, they scoffed contemptuously. "What are you doing? Are you rebelling against the king?" they asked.
16Neh 2:20 I replied, "The God of heaven will help us succeed. We, his servants, will start rebuilding this wall. But you have no share, legal right, or historic claim in Jerusalem."
16Neh 3:1 Then Eliashib the high priest and the other priests started to rebuild at the Sheep Gate. They dedicated it and set up its doors, building the wall as far as the Tower of the Hundred, which they dedicated, and the Tower of Hananel.
16Neh 3:2 People from the town of Jericho worked next to them, and beyond them was Zaccur son of Imri.

16Neh 3:8 Next was Uzziel son of Harhaiah, a goldsmith by trade, who also worked on the wall. Beyond him was Hananiah, a manufacturer of perfumes. They left out a section of Jerusalem as they built the Broad Wall��. / ��Or They fortified Jerusalem up to the Broad Wall
16Neh 3:9 Rephaiah son of Hur, the leader of half the district of Jerusalem, was next to them on the wall.
16Neh 3:10 Next Jedaiah son of Harumaph repaired the wall across from his own house, and next to him was Hattush son of Hashabneiah.
16Neh 3:11 Then came Malkijah son of Harim and Hasshub son of Pahath-moab, who repaired another section of the wall and the Tower of the Ovens.
16Neh 3:12 Shallum son of Hallohesh and his daughters repaired the next section. He was the leader of the other half of the district of Jerusalem.
16Neh 3:13 The Valley Gate was repaired by the people from Zanoah, led by Hanun. They set up its doors and installed its bolts and bars. They also repaired the 1,500 feet�� of wall to the Dung Gate. / ��Hebrew 1,000 cubits [450 meters]
16Neh 3:14 The Dung Gate was repaired by Malkijah son of Recab, the leader of the Beth-hakkerem district. He rebuilt it, set up its doors, and installed its bolts and bars.
16Neh 3:15 The Fountain Gate was repaired by Shallum�� son of Col-hozeh, the leader of the Mizpah district. He rebuilt it, roofed it, set up its doors, and installed its bolts and bars.

16Neh 3:17 Next to him, repairs were made by a group of Levites working under the supervision of Rehum son of Bani. Then came Hashabiah, the leader of half the district of Keilah, who supervised the building of the wall on behalf of his own district.

16Neh 3:20 Next to him was Baruch son of Zabbai, who zealously repaired an additional section from the angle to the door of the house of Eliashib the high priest.
16Neh 3:21 Meremoth son of Uriah and grandson of Hakkoz rebuilt another section of the wall extending from the door of Eliashib's house to the end of the house.
16Neh 3:22 The next repairs were made by the priests from the surrounding region.
16Neh 3:23 After them, Benjamin and Hasshub repaired the section across from their house, and Azariah son of Maaseiah and grandson of Ananiah repaired the section across from his house.
16Neh 3:24 Next was Binnui son of Henadad, who rebuilt another section of the wall from Azariah's house to the angle and the corner.
16Neh 3:25 Palal son of Uzai carried on the work from a point opposite the angle and the tower that projects up from the king's upper house beside the court of the guard. Next to him were Pedaiah son of Parosh,
16Neh 3:26 with the Temple servants living on the hill of Ophel, who repaired the wall as far as a point across from the Water Gate to the east and the projecting tower.
16Neh 3:27 Then came the people of Tekoa, who repaired another section across from the great projecting tower and over to the wall of Ophel.
16Neh 3:28 Above the Horse Gate, the priests repaired the wall. Each one repaired the section immediately across from his own house.
16Neh 3:29 Next Zadok son of Immer also rebuilt the wall across from his own house, and beyond him was Shemaiah son of Shecaniah, the gatekeeper of the East Gate.
16Neh 3:30 Next Hananiah son of Shelemiah and Hanun, the sixth son of Zalaph, repaired another section, while Meshullam son of Berekiah rebuilt the wall across from where he lived.
16Neh 3:31 Malkijah, one of the goldsmiths, repaired the wall as far as the housing for the Temple servants and merchants, across from the Inspection Gate. Then he continued as far as the upper room at the corner.
16Neh 3:32 The other goldsmiths and merchants repaired the wall from that corner to the Sheep Gate.
16Neh 4:1 ��Sanballat was very angry when he learned that we were rebuilding the wall. He flew into a rage and mocked the Jews, / ��Verses 4.1-6 are numbered 3.33-38 in Hebrew text
16Neh 4:2 saying in front of his friends and the Samarian army officers, "What does this bunch of poor, feeble Jews think they're doing? Do they think they can build the wall in a single day by just offering a few sacrifices?�� Do they actually think they can make something of stones from a rubbish heap - and charred ones at that?" / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
16Neh 4:3 Tobiah the Ammonite, who was standing beside him, remarked, "That stone wall would collapse if even a fox walked along the top of it!"
16Neh 4:4 Then I prayed, "Hear us, our God, for we are being mocked. May their scoffing fall back on their own heads, and may they themselves become captives in a foreign land!
16Neh 4:5 Do not ignore their guilt. Do not blot out their sins, for they have provoked you to anger here in front of�� the builders." / ��Or for they have thrown insults in the face of
16Neh 4:6 At last the wall was completed to half its height around the entire city, for the people had worked with enthusiasm.
16Neh 4:7 ��But when Sanballat and Tobiah and the Arabs, Ammonites, and Ashdodites heard that the work was going ahead and that the gaps in the wall of Jerusalem were being repaired, they were furious. / ��Verses 4.7-23 are numbered 4.1-17 in Hebrew text
16Neh 4:8 They all made plans to come and fight against Jerusalem and throw us into confusion.
16Neh 4:9 But we prayed to our God and guarded the city day and night to protect ourselves.
16Neh 4:10 Then the people of Judah began to complain, "The workers are getting tired, and there is so much rubble to be moved. We will never be able to build the wall by ourselves."
16Neh 4:11 Meanwhile, our enemies were saying, "Before they know what's happening, we will swoop down on them and kill them and end their work."
16Neh 4:12 The Jews who lived near the enemy came and told us again and again, "They will come from all directions and attack us!"�� / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
16Neh 4:13 So I placed armed guards behind the lowest parts of the wall in the exposed areas. I stationed the people to stand guard by families, armed with swords, spears, and bows.
16Neh 4:14 Then as I looked over the situation, I called together the nobles and the rest of the people and said to them, "Don't be afraid of the enemy! Remember the Lord, who is great and glorious, and fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes!"
16Neh 4:15 When our enemies heard that we knew of their plans and that God had frustrated them, we all returned to our work on the wall.
16Neh 4:16 But from then on, only half my men worked while the other half stood guard with spears, shields, bows, and coats of mail. The leaders stationed themselves behind the people of Judah
16Neh 4:17 who were building the wall. The laborers carried on their work with one hand supporting their load and one hand holding a weapon.
16Neh 4:18 All the builders had a sword belted to their side. The trumpeter stayed with me to sound the alarm.
16Neh 4:19 Then I explained to the nobles and officials and all the people, "The work is very spread out, and we are widely separated from each other along the wall.
16Neh 4:20 When you hear the blast of the trumpet, rush to wherever it is sounding. Then our God will fight for us!"
16Neh 4:21 We worked early and late, from sunrise to sunset. And half the men were always on guard.
16Neh 4:22 I also told everyone living outside the walls to stay in Jerusalem. That way they and their servants could help with guard duty at night and work during the day.
16Neh 4:23 During this time, none of us - not I, nor my relatives, nor my servants, nor the guards who were with me - ever took off our clothes. We carried our weapons with us at all times, even when we went for water��. / ��Or Each carried his weapon in his right hand. Hebrew reads Each his weapon the water. The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
16Neh 5:1 About this time some of the men and their wives raised a cry of protest against their fellow Jews.
16Neh 5:2 They were saying, "We have such large families. We need more food to survive."
16Neh 5:3 Others said, "We have mortgaged our fields, vineyards, and homes to get food during the famine."
16Neh 5:4 And others said, "We have had to borrow money on our fields and vineyards to pay our taxes.
16Neh 5:5 We belong to the same family as those who are wealthy, and our children are just like theirs. Yet we must sell our children into slavery just to get enough money to live. We have already sold some of our daughters, and we are helpless to do anything about it, for our fields and vineyards are already mortgaged to others."
16Neh 5:6 When I heard their complaints, I was very angry.
16Neh 5:7 After thinking it over, I spoke out against these nobles and officials. I told them, "You are hurting your own relatives by charging interest when they borrow money!" Then I called a public meeting to deal with the problem.
16Neh 5:8 At the meeting I said to them, "We are doing all we can to redeem our Jewish relatives who have had to sell themselves to pagan foreigners, but you are selling them back into slavery again. How often must we redeem them?" And they had nothing to say in their defense.
16Neh 5:9 Then I pressed further, "What you are doing is not right! Should you not walk in the fear of our God in order to avoid being mocked by enemy nations?
16Neh 5:10 I myself, as well as my brothers and my workers, have been lending the people money and grain, but now let us stop this business of charging interest.
16Neh 5:11 You must restore their fields, vineyards, olive groves, and homes to them this very day. And repay the interest you charged when you lent them money, grain, new wine, and olive oil."
16Neh 5:12 They replied, "We will give back everything and demand nothing more from the people. We will do as you say." Then I called the priests and made the nobles and officials swear to do what they had promised.
16Neh 5:13 I shook out the folds of my robe and said, "If you fail to keep your promise, may God shake you like this from your homes and from your property!" The whole assembly responded, "Amen," and they praised the LORD. And the people did as they had promised.
16Neh 5:14 For the entire twelve years that I was governor of Judah - from the twentieth year to the thirty-second year of the reign of King Artaxerxes�� - neither I nor my officials drew on our official food allowance. / ��That is, 445-433 B.C.
16Neh 5:15 The former governors, in contrast, had laid heavy burdens on the people, demanding a daily ration of food and wine, besides forty pieces�� of silver. Even their assistants took advantage of the people. But because I feared God, I did not act that way. / ��Hebrew 40 shekels [1 pound, or 456 grams]
16Neh 5:16 I also devoted myself to working on the wall and refused to acquire any land. And I required all my servants to spend time working on the wall.
16Neh 5:17 I asked for nothing, even though I regularly fed 150 Jewish officials at my table, besides all the visitors from other lands!
16Neh 5:18 The provisions I paid for each day included one ox, six choice sheep or goats, and a large number of poultry. And every ten days we needed a large supply of all kinds of wine. Yet I refused to claim the governor's food allowance because the people already carried a heavy burden.
16Neh 5:19 Remember, O my God, all that I have done for these people, and bless me for it.
16Neh 6:1 Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies found out that I had finished rebuilding the wall and that no gaps remained - though we had not yet set up the doors in the gates.
16Neh 6:2 So Sanballat and Geshem sent a message asking me to meet them at one of the villages�� in the plain of Ono.But I realized they were plotting to harm me, / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew reads at Kephirim
16Neh 6:3 so I replied by sending this message to them�� "I am engaged in a great work, so I can't come. Why should I stop working to come and meet with you?"
16Neh 6:4 Four times they sent the same message, and each time I gave the same reply.
16Neh 6:5 The fifth time, Sanballat's servant came with an open letter in his hand,
16Neh 6:6 and this is what it said�� "There is a rumor among the surrounding nations, and Geshem�� tells me it is true, that you and the Jews are planning to rebel and that is why you are building the wall. According to his reports, you plan to be their king. / ��Hebrew Gashmu, a variant spelling of Geshem
16Neh 6:7 He also reports that you have appointed prophets in Jerusalem to proclaim about you, 'Look! There is a king in Judah!' "You can be very sure that this report will get back to the king, so I suggest that you come and talk it over with me."
16Neh 6:8 I replied, "There is no truth in any part of your story. You are making up the whole thing."
16Neh 6:9 They were just trying to intimidate us, imagining that they could discourage us and stop the work. So I continued the work with even greater determination��. / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew reads But now to strengthen my hands
16Neh 6:10 Later I went to visit Shemaiah son of Delaiah and grandson of Mehetabel, who was confined to his home. He said, "Let us meet together inside the Temple of God and bolt the doors shut. Your enemies are coming to kill you tonight."
16Neh 6:11 But I replied, "Should someone in my position run from danger? Should someone in my position enter the Temple to save his life? No, I won't do it!"
16Neh 6:12 I realized that God had not spoken to him, but that he had uttered this prophecy against me because Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him.
16Neh 6:13 They were hoping to intimidate me and make me sin. Then they would be able to accuse and discredit me.
16Neh 6:14 Remember, O my God, all the evil things that Tobiah and Sanballat have done. And remember Noadiah the prophet and all the prophets like her who have tried to intimidate me.
16Neh 6:15 So on October 2�� the wall was finished - just fifty-two days after we had begun. / ��Hebrew on the twenty-fifth day of the month Elul, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was October 2, 445 B.C.; also see note on 1.1
16Neh 6:16 When our enemies and the surrounding nations heard about it, they were frightened and humiliated. They realized this work had been done with the help of our God.
16Neh 6:17 During those fifty-two days, many letters went back and forth between Tobiah and the nobles of Judah.
16Neh 6:18 For many in Judah had sworn allegiance to him because his father-in-law was Shecaniah son of Arah, and his son Jehohanan was married to the daughter of Meshullam son of Berekiah.
16Neh 6:19 They kept telling me about Tobiah's good deeds, and then they told him everything I said. And Tobiah kept sending threatening letters to intimidate me.
16Neh 7:1 After the wall was finished and I had set up the doors in the gates, the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites were appointed.
16Neh 7:2 I gave the responsibility of governing Jerusalem to my brother Hanani, along with Hananiah, the commander of the fortress, for he was a faithful man who feared God more than most.
16Neh 7:3 I said to them, "Do not leave the gates open during the hottest part of the day��. And even while the gatekeepers are on duty, have them shut and bar the doors. Appoint the residents of Jerusalem to act as guards, everyone on a regular watch. Some will serve at sentry posts and some in front of their own homes." / ��Or Keep the gates of Jerusalem closed until the sun is hot
16Neh 7:4 At that time the city was large and spacious, but the population was small, and none of the houses had been rebuilt.
16Neh 7:5 So my God gave me the idea to call together all the nobles and leaders of the city, along with the ordinary citizens, for registration. I had found the genealogical record of those who had first returned to Judah. This is what was written there.
16Neh 7:6 Here is the list of the Jewish exiles of the provinces who returned from their captivity. King Nebuchadnezzar had deported them to Babylon, but now they returned to Jerusalem and the other towns in Judah where they originally lived.
16Neh 7:7 Their leaders were Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah��, Reelaiah��, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispar��, Bigvai, Rehum��, and Baanah.

16Neh 7:62 This group included the families of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda - a total of 642 people.
16Neh 7:63 Three families of priests - Hobaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai - also returned. (This Barzillai had married a woman who was a descendant of Barzillai of Gilead, and he had taken her family name.)
16Neh 7:64 They searched for their names in the genealogical records, but they were not found, so they were disqualified from serving as priests.
16Neh 7:65 The governor told them not to eat the priests' share of food from the sacrifices until a priest could consult the LORD about the matter by using the Urim and Thummim - the sacred lots.
16Neh 7:66 So a total of 42,360 people returned to Judah,

16Neh 7:73 So the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the Temple servants, and some of the common people settled near Jerusalem. The rest of the people returned to their own towns throughout Israel. In October��, when the Israelites had settled in their towns, / �� Hebrew in the seventh month. This month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred within the months of October and November 445 B.C.
16Neh 8:1 all the people assembled with a unified purpose at the square just inside the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring out the Book of the Law of Moses, which the LORD had given for Israel to obey.
16Neh 8:2 So on October 8�� Ezra the priest brought the Book of the Law before the assembly, which included the men and women and all the children old enough to understand. / ��Hebrew on the first day of the seventh month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was October 8, 445 B.C.; also see note on 1.1
16Neh 8:3 He faced the square just inside the Water Gate from early morning until noon and read aloud to everyone who could understand. All the people listened closely to the Book of the Law.
16Neh 8:4 Ezra the scribe stood on a high wooden platform that had been made for the occasion. To his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Maaseiah. To his left stood Pedaiah, Mishael, Malkijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
16Neh 8:5 Ezra stood on the platform in full view of all the people. When they saw him open the book, they all rose to their feet.
16Neh 8:6 Then Ezra praised the LORD, the great God, and all the people chanted, "Amen! Amen!" as they lifted their hands. Then they bowed down and worshiped the LORD with their faces to the ground.
16Neh 8:7 The Levites - Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, and Pelaiah - then instructed the people in the Law while everyone remained in their places.
16Neh 8:8 They read from the Book of the Law of God and clearly explained the meaning of what was being read, helping the people understand each passage.
16Neh 8:9 Then Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who were interpreting for the people said to them, "Don't mourn or weep on such a day as this! For today is a sacred day before the LORD your God." For the people had all been weeping as they listened to the words of the Law.
16Neh 8:10 And Nehemiah�� continued, "Go and celebrate with a feast of rich foods and sweet drinks, and share gifts of food with people who have nothing prepared. This is a sacred day before our Lord. Don't be dejected and sad, for the joy of the LORD is your strength!" / ��Hebrew he
16Neh 8:11 And the Levites, too, quieted the people, telling them, "Hush! Don't weep! For this is a sacred day."
16Neh 8:12 So the people went away to eat and drink at a festive meal, to share gifts of food, and to celebrate with great joy because they had heard God's words and understood them.
16Neh 8:13 On October 9�� the family leaders of all the people, together with the priests and Levites, met with Ezra the scribe to go over the Law in greater detail. / ��Hebrew On the second day, of the seventh month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was October 9, 445 B.C.; also see notes on 1.1 and 8.2
16Neh 8:14 As they studied the Law, they discovered that the LORD had commanded through Moses that the Israelites should live in shelters during the festival to be held that month��. / ��Hebrew in the seventh month. This month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar usually occurs within the months of September and October. See Lev 23.39-43
16Neh 8:15 He had said that a proclamation should be made throughout their towns and in Jerusalem, telling the people to go to the hills to get branches from olive, wild olive��, myrtle, palm, and other leafy trees. They were to use these branches to make shelters in which they would live during the festival, as prescribed in the Law. / ��Or pine; Hebrew reads oil tree
16Neh 8:16 So the people went out and cut branches and used them to build shelters on the roofs of their houses, in their courtyards, in the courtyards of God's Temple, or in the squares just inside the Water Gate and the Ephraim Gate.
16Neh 8:17 So everyone who had returned from captivity lived in these shelters during the festival, and they were all filled with great joy! The Israelites had not celebrated like this since the days of Joshua�� son of Nun. / ��Hebrew Jeshua, a variant spelling of Joshua
16Neh 8:18 Ezra read from the Book of the Law of God on each of the seven days of the festival. Then on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly, as was required by law.

This day was October 31, 445 B.C.; also see notes on 1.1 and 8.2
16Neh 9:2 Those of Israelite descent separated themselves from all foreigners as they confessed their own sins and the sins of their ancestors.
16Neh 9:3 They remained standing in place for three hours�� while the Book of the Law of the LORD their God was read aloud to them. Then for three more hours they confessed their sins and worshiped the LORD their God. / ��Hebrew for a quarter of a day
16Neh 9:4 The Levites - Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Kenani - stood on the stairway of the Levites and cried out to the LORD their God with loud voices.
16Neh 9:5 Then the leaders of the Levites - Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah - called out to the people�� "Stand up and praise the LORD your God, for he lives from everlasting to everlasting!" Then they prayed�� "May your glorious name be praised! May it be exalted above all blessing and praise!
16Neh 9:6 "You alone are the LORD. You made the skies and the heavens and all the stars. You made the earth and the seas and everything in them. You preserve them all, and the angels of heaven worship you.
16Neh 9:7 "You are the LORD God, who chose Abram and brought him from Ur of the Chaldeans and renamed him Abraham.
16Neh 9:8 When he had proved himself faithful, you made a covenant with him to give him and his descendants the land of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Jebusites, and Girgashites. And you have done what you promised, for you are always true to your word.
16Neh 9:9 "You saw the misery of our ancestors in Egypt, and you heard their cries from beside the Red Sea��. / ��Hebrew sea of reeds
16Neh 9:10 You displayed miraculous signs and wonders against Pharaoh, his officials, and all his people, for you knew how arrogantly they were treating our ancestors. You have a glorious reputation that has never been forgotten.
16Neh 9:11 You divided the sea for your people so they could walk through on dry land! And then you hurled their enemies into the depths of the sea. They sank like stones beneath the mighty waters.
16Neh 9:12 You led our ancestors by a pillar of cloud during the day and a pillar of fire at night so that they could find their way.
16Neh 9:13 "You came down at Mount Sinai and spoke to them from heaven. You gave them regulations and instructions that were just, and decrees and commands that were good.
16Neh 9:14 You instructed them concerning your holy Sabbath. And you commanded them, through Moses your servant, to obey all your commands, decrees, and instructions.
16Neh 9:15 "You gave them bread from heaven when they were hungry and water from the rock when they were thirsty. You commanded them to go and take possession of the land you had sworn to give them.
16Neh 9:16 "But our ancestors were proud and stubborn, and they paid no attention to your commands.
16Neh 9:17 They refused to obey and did not remember the miracles you had done for them. Instead, they became stubborn and appointed a leader to take them back to their slavery in Egypt! But you are a God of forgiveness, gracious and merciful, slow to become angry, and rich in unfailing love. You did not abandon them,
16Neh 9:18 even when they made an idol shaped like a calf and said, 'This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!' They committed terrible blasphemies.
16Neh 9:19 "But in your great mercy you did not abandon them to die in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud still led them forward by day, and the pillar of fire showed them the way through the night.
16Neh 9:20 You sent your good Spirit to instruct them, and you did not stop giving them manna from heaven or water for their thirst.
16Neh 9:21 For forty years you sustained them in the wilderness, and they lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell!
16Neh 9:22 "Then you helped our ancestors conquer kingdoms and nations, and you placed your people in every corner of the land��. They took over the land of King Sihon of Heshbon and the land of King Og of Bashan. / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain
16Neh 9:23 You made their descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and brought them into the land you had promised to their ancestors.
16Neh 9:24 "They went in and took possession of the land. You subdued whole nations before them. Even the Canaanites, who inhabited the land, were powerless! Your people could deal with these nations and their kings as they pleased.
16Neh 9:25 Our ancestors captured fortified cities and fertile land. They took over houses full of good things, with cisterns already dug and vineyards and olive groves and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate until they were full and grew fat and enjoyed themselves in all your blessings.
16Neh 9:26 "But despite all this, they were disobedient and rebelled against you. They turned their backs on your Law, they killed your prophets who warned them to return to you, and they committed terrible blasphemies.
16Neh 9:27 So you handed them over to their enemies, who made them suffer. But in their time of trouble they cried to you, and you heard them from heaven. In your great mercy, you sent them liberators who rescued them from their enemies.
16Neh 9:28 "But as soon as they were at peace, your people again committed evil in your sight, and once more you let their enemies conquer them. Yet whenever your people turned and cried to you again for help, you listened once more from heaven. In your wonderful mercy, you rescued them many times!
16Neh 9:29 "You warned them to return to your Law, but they became proud and obstinate and disobeyed your commands. They did not follow your regulations, by which people will find life if only they obey. They stubbornly turned their backs on you and refused to listen.
16Neh 9:30 In your love, you were patient with them for many years. You sent your Spirit, who warned them through the prophets. But still they wouldn't listen! So once again you allowed the peoples of the land to conquer them.
16Neh 9:31 But in your great mercy, you did not destroy them completely or abandon them forever. What a gracious and merciful God you are!
16Neh 9:32 "And now, our God, the great and mighty and awesome God, who keeps his covenant of unfailing love, do not let all the hardships we have suffered seem insignificant to you. Great trouble has come upon us and upon our kings and leaders and priests and prophets and ancestors - all of your people - from the days when the kings of Assyria first triumphed over us until now.
16Neh 9:33 Every time you punished us you were being just. We have sinned greatly, and you gave us only what we deserved.
16Neh 9:34 Our kings, leaders, priests, and ancestors did not obey your Law or listen to the warnings in your commands and laws.
16Neh 9:35 Even while they had their own kingdom, they did not serve you, though you showered your goodness on them. You gave them a large, fertile land, but they refused to turn from their wickedness.
16Neh 9:36 "So now today we are slaves in the land of plenty that you gave our ancestors for their enjoyment! We are slaves here in this good land.
16Neh 9:37 The lush produce of this land piles up in the hands of the kings whom you have set over us because of our sins. They have power over us and our livestock. We serve them at their pleasure, and we are in great misery."

16Neh 11:4 but some of the people from Judah and Benjamin resettled in Jerusalem.) From the tribe of Judah�� Athaiah son of Uzziah, son of Zechariah, son of Amariah, son of Shephatiah, son of Mahalalel, of the family of Perez.

16Neh 11:18 In all, there were 284 Levites in the holy city.
16Neh 11:19 From the gatekeepers�� Akkub, Talmon, and 172 of their associates, who guarded the gates.
16Neh 11:20 The other priests, Levites, and the rest of the Israelites lived wherever their family inheritance was located in any of the towns of Judah.
16Neh 11:21 The Temple servants, however, whose leaders were Ziha and Gishpa, all lived on the hill of Ophel.
16Neh 11:22 The chief officer of the Levites in Jerusalem was Uzzi son of Bani, son of Hashabiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Mica, a descendant of Asaph, whose family served as singers at God's Temple.
16Neh 11:23 Their daily responsibilities were carried out according to the terms of a royal command.
16Neh 11:24 Pethahiah son of Meshezabel, a descendant of Zerah son of Judah, was the royal adviser in all matters of public administration.
16Neh 11:25 As for the surrounding villages with their open fields, some of the people of Judah lived in Kiriath-arba with its settlements, Dibon with its settlements, and Jekabzeel with its villages.
16Neh 11:26 They also lived in Jeshua, Moladah, Beth-pelet,
16Neh 11:27 Hazar-shual, Beersheba with its settlements,
16Neh 11:28 Ziklag, and Meconah with its settlements.
16Neh 11:29 They also lived in En-rimmon, Zorah, Jarmuth,
16Neh 11:30 Zanoah, and Adullam with their surrounding villages. They also lived in Lachish with its nearby fields and Azekah with its surrounding villages. So the people of Judah were living all the way from Beersheba in the south to the valley of Hinnom.
16Neh 11:31 Some of the people of Benjamin lived at Geba, Micmash, Aija, and Bethel with its settlements.
16Neh 11:32 They also lived in Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,

16Neh 11:35 Lod, Ono, and the Valley of Craftsmen��. / ��Or and Ge-harashim
16Neh 11:36 Some of the Levites who lived in Judah were sent to live with the tribe of Benjamin.
16Neh 12:1 Here is the list of the priests and Levites who returned with Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel and Jeshua the high priest�� Seraiah, Jeremiah, Ezra,
16Neh 12:2 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,
16Neh 12:3 Shecaniah, Harim��, Meremoth, / ��Hebrew Rehum; compare 7.42; 12.15; Ezra 2.39

16Neh 12:6 Shemaiah, Joiarib, Jedaiah,
16Neh 12:7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jedaiah. These were the leaders of the priests and their associates in the days of Jeshua.
16Neh 12:8 The Levites who returned with them were Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who with his associates was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving.
16Neh 12:9 Their associates, Bakbukiah and Unni, stood opposite them during the service.
16Neh 12:10 Jeshua the high priest was the father of Joiakim. Joiakim was the father of Eliashib. Eliashib was the father of Joiada.
16Neh 12:11 Joiada was the father of Johanan��. Johanan was the father of Jaddua. / ��Hebrew Jonathan; compare 12.22
16Neh 12:12 Now when Joiakim was high priest, the family leaders of the priests were as follows�� Meraiah was leader of the family of Seraiah. Hananiah was leader of the family of Jeremiah.
16Neh 12:13 Meshullam was leader of the family of Ezra. Jehohanan was leader of the family of Amariah.
16Neh 12:14 Jonathan was leader of the family of Malluch��. Joseph was leader of the family of Shecaniah��./ ��As in Greek version (see also 10.4; 12.2); Hebrew reads Malluchi. ��As in many Hebrew manuscripts, some Greek manuscripts, and Syriac version (see also 12.3); most Hebrew manuscripts read Shebaniah

16Neh 12:16 Zechariah was leader of the family of Iddo. Meshullam was leader of the family of Ginnethon.
16Neh 12:17 Zicri was leader of the family of Abijah. There was also a�� leader of the family of Miniamin. Piltai was leader of the family of Moadiah. / ��Hebrew lacks the name of this family leader
16Neh 12:18 Shammua was leader of the family of Bilgah. Jehonathan was leader of the family of Shemaiah.
16Neh 12:19 Mattenai was leader of the family of Joiarib. Uzzi was leader of the family of Jedaiah.

16Neh 12:21 Hashabiah was leader of the family of Hilkiah. Nethanel was leader of the family of Jedaiah.
16Neh 12:22 A record of the Levite families was kept during the years when Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua served as high priest. Another record of the priests was kept during the reign of Darius the Persian��. / ��Darius the Persian is probably Darius II, who reigned 423?404 B.C., or possibly Darius III, who reigned 336?331 B.C.
16Neh 12:23 A record of the heads of the Levite families was kept in The Book of History down to the days of Johanan, the grandson�� of Eliashib. / ��Hebrew descendant; compare 12.10-11
16Neh 12:24 These were the family leaders of the Levites�� Hashabiah, Sherebiah, Jeshua, Binnui��, Kadmiel, and other associates, who stood opposite them during the ceremonies of praise and thanksgiving, one section responding to the other, as commanded by David, the man of God. / ��Hebrew son of (i.e., ben), which should probably be read here as the proper name Binnui; compare Ezra 3.9 and the note there
16Neh 12:25 This included Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, and Obadiah.Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were the gatekeepers in charge of the storerooms at the gates.
16Neh 12:26 These all served in the days of Joiakim son of Jeshua, son of Jehozadak��, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor and of Ezra the priest and scribe. / ��Hebrew Jozadak, a variant spelling of Jehozadak
16Neh 12:27 For the dedication of the new wall of Jerusalem, the Levites throughout the land were asked to come to Jerusalem to assist in the ceremonies. They were to take part in the joyous occasion with their songs of thanksgiving and with the music of cymbals, harps, and lyres.
16Neh 12:28 The singers were brought together from the region around Jerusalem and from the villages of the Netophathites.
16Neh 12:29 They also came from Beth-gilgal and the rural areas near Geba and Azmaveth, for the singers had built their own settlements around Jerusalem.
16Neh 12:30 The priests and Levites first purified themselves; then they purified the people, the gates, and the wall.
16Neh 12:31 I led the leaders of Judah to the top of the wall and organized two large choirs to give thanks. One of the choirs proceeded southward�� along the top of the wall to the Dung Gate. / ��Hebrew to the right
16Neh 12:32 Hoshaiah and half the leaders of Judah followed them,
16Neh 12:33 along with Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam,
16Neh 12:34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah.
16Neh 12:35 Then came some priests who played trumpets, including Zechariah son of Jonathan, son of Shemaiah, son of Mattaniah, son of Micaiah, son of Zaccur, a descendant of Asaph.
16Neh 12:36 And Zechariah's colleagues were Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani. They used the musical instruments prescribed by David, the man of God. Ezra the scribe led this procession.
16Neh 12:37 At the Fountain Gate they went straight up the steps on the ascent of the city wall toward the City of David. They passed the house of David and then proceeded to the Water Gate on the east.
16Neh 12:38 The second choir giving thanks went northward�� around the other way to meet them. I followed them, together with the other half of the people, along the top of the wall past the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, / ��Hebrew to the left
16Neh 12:39 then past the Ephraim Gate to the Old City Gate��, past the Fish Gate and the Tower of Hananel, and on to the Tower of the Hundred. Then we continued on to the Sheep Gate and stopped at the Guard Gate. / ��Or the Mishneh Gate, or the Jeshanah Gate
16Neh 12:40 The two choirs that were giving thanks then proceeded to the Temple of God, where they took their places. So did I, together with the group of leaders who were with me.
16Neh 12:41 We went together with the trumpet-playing priests - Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah - 
16Neh 12:42 and the singers - Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malkijah, Elam, and Ezer. They played and sang loudly under the direction of Jezrahiah the choir director.
16Neh 12:43 Many sacrifices were offered on that joyous day, for God had given the people cause for great joy. The women and children also participated in the celebration, and the joy of the people of Jerusalem could be heard far away.
16Neh 12:44 On that day men were appointed to be in charge of the storerooms for the offerings, the first part of the harvest, and the tithes. They were responsible to collect from the fields outside the towns the portions required by the Law for the priests and Levites. For all the people of Judah took joy in the priests and Levites and their work.
16Neh 12:45 They performed the service of their God and the service of purification, as commanded by David and his son Solomon, and so did the singers and the gatekeepers.
16Neh 12:46 The custom of having choir directors to lead the choirs in hymns of praise and thanksgiving to God began long ago in the days of David and Asaph.
16Neh 12:47 So now, in the days of Zerubbabel and of Nehemiah, all Israel brought a daily supply of food for the singers, the gatekeepers, and the Levites. The Levites, in turn, gave a portion of what they received to the priests, the descendants of Aaron.
16Neh 13:1 On that same day, as the Book of Moses was being read to the people, the passage was found that said no Ammonite or Moabite should ever be permitted to enter the assembly of God��. / ��See Deut 23.3-6
16Neh 13:2 For they had not provided the Israelites with food and water in the wilderness. Instead, they hired Balaam to curse them, though our God turned the curse into a blessing.
16Neh 13:3 When this passage of the Law was read, all those of foreign descent were immediately excluded from the assembly.
16Neh 13:4 Before this had happened, Eliashib the priest, who had been appointed as supervisor of the storerooms of the Temple of our God and who was also a relative of Tobiah,
16Neh 13:5 had converted a large storage room and placed it at Tobiah's disposal. The room had previously been used for storing the grain offerings, the frankincense, various articles for the Temple, and the tithes of grain, new wine, and olive oil (which were prescribed for the Levites, the singers, and the gatekeepers), as well as the offerings for the priests.
16Neh 13:6 I was not in Jerusalem at that time, for I had returned to King Artaxerxes of Babylon in the thirty-second year of his reign��, though I later asked his permission to return. / ��King Artaxerxes of Persia is here identified as the king of Babylon because Persia had conquered the Babylonian Empire. The thirty-second year of Artaxerxes was 433 B.C.
16Neh 13:7 When I arrived back in Jerusalem, I learned about Eliashib's evil deed in providing Tobiah with a room in the courtyards of the Temple of God.
16Neh 13:8 I became very upset and threw all of Tobiah's belongings out of the room.
16Neh 13:9 Then I demanded that the rooms be purified, and I brought back the articles for God's Temple, the grain offerings, and the frankincense.
16Neh 13:10 I also discovered that the Levites had not been given their prescribed portions of food, so they and the singers who were to conduct the worship services had all returned to work their fields.
16Neh 13:11 I immediately confronted the leaders and demanded, "Why has the Temple of God been neglected?" Then I called all the Levites back again and restored them to their proper duties.
16Neh 13:12 And once more all the people of Judah began bringing their tithes of grain, new wine, and olive oil to the Temple storerooms.
16Neh 13:13 I assigned supervisors for the storerooms�� Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah, one of the Levites. And I appointed Hanan son of Zaccur and grandson of Mattaniah as their assistant. These men had an excellent reputation, and it was their job to make honest distributions to their fellow Levites.
16Neh 13:14 Remember this good deed, O my God, and do not forget all that I have faithfully done for the Temple of my God and its services.
16Neh 13:15 In those days I saw men of Judah treading out their winepresses on the Sabbath. They were also bringing in grain, loading it on donkeys, and bringing their wine, grapes, figs, and all sorts of produce to Jerusalem to sell on the Sabbath. So I rebuked them for selling their produce on that day.
16Neh 13:16 Some men from Tyre, who lived in Jerusalem, were bringing in fish and all kinds of merchandise. They were selling it on the Sabbath to the people of Judah - and in Jerusalem at that!
16Neh 13:17 So I confronted the nobles of Judah. "Why are you profaning the Sabbath in this evil way?" I asked.
16Neh 13:18 "Wasn't it just this sort of thing that your ancestors did that caused our God to bring all this trouble upon us and our city? Now you are bringing even more wrath upon Israel by permitting the Sabbath to be desecrated in this way!"
16Neh 13:19 Then I commanded that the gates of Jerusalem should be shut as darkness fell every Friday evening��, not to be opened until the Sabbath ended. I sent some of my own servants to guard the gates so that no merchandise could be brought in on the Sabbath day. / ��Hebrew on the day before the Sabbath
16Neh 13:20 The merchants and tradesmen with a variety of wares camped outside Jerusalem once or twice.
16Neh 13:21 But I spoke sharply to them and said, "What are you doing out here, camping around the wall? If you do this again, I will arrest you!" And that was the last time they came on the Sabbath.
16Neh 13:22 Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and to guard the gates in order to preserve the holiness of the Sabbath. Remember this good deed also, O my God! Have compassion on me according to your great and unfailing love.
16Neh 13:23 About the same time I realized that some of the men of Judah had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab.
16Neh 13:24 Furthermore, half their children spoke the language of Ashdod or of some other people and could not speak the language of Judah at all.
16Neh 13:25 So I confronted them and called down curses on them. I beat some of them and pulled out their hair. I made them swear in the name of God that they would not let their children intermarry with the pagan people of the land.
16Neh 13:26 "Wasn't this exactly what led King Solomon of Israel into sin?" I demanded. "There was no king from any nation who could compare to him, and God loved him and made him king over all Israel. But even he was led into sin by his foreign wives.
16Neh 13:27 How could you even think of committing this sinful deed and acting unfaithfully toward God by marrying foreign women?"
16Neh 13:28 One of the sons of Joiada son of Eliashib the high priest had married a daughter of Sanballat the Horonite, so I banished him from my presence.
16Neh 13:29 Remember them, O my God, for they have defiled the priesthood and the solemn vows of the priests and Levites.
16Neh 13:30 So I purged out everything foreign and assigned tasks to the priests and Levites, making certain that each knew his work.
16Neh 13:31 I also made sure that the supply of wood for the altar and the first portions of the harvest were brought at the proper times. Remember this in my favor, O my God.

17Est 1:1 These events happened in the days of King Xerxes��, who reigned over 127 provinces stretching from India to Ethiopia��. / ��Hebrew Ahasuerus, another name for Xerxes; also throughout the book of Esther. Xerxes reigned 486-465 B.C. ��Hebrew to Cush
17Est 1:2 At that time Xerxes ruled his empire from his royal throne at the fortress of Susa.
17Est 1:3 In the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet for all his nobles and officials. He invited all the military officers of Persia and Media as well as the princes and nobles of the provinces.
17Est 1:4 The celebration lasted 180 days - a tremendous display of the opulent wealth of his empire and the pomp and splendor of his majesty.
17Est 1:5 When it was all over, the king gave a banquet for all the people, from the greatest to the least, who were in the fortress of Susa. It lasted for seven days and was held in the courtyard of the palace garden.
17Est 1:6 The courtyard was beautifully decorated with white cotton curtains and blue hangings, which were fastened with white linen cords and purple ribbons to silver rings embedded in marble pillars. Gold and silver couches stood on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl, and other costly stones.
17Est 1:7 Drinks were served in gold goblets of many designs, and there was an abundance of royal wine, reflecting the king's generosity.
17Est 1:8 By edict of the king, no limits were placed on the drinking, for the king had instructed all his palace officials to serve each man as much as he wanted.
17Est 1:9 At the same time, Queen Vashti gave a banquet for the women in the royal palace of King Xerxes.
17Est 1:10 On the seventh day of the feast, when King Xerxes was in high spirits because of the wine, he told the seven eunuchs who attended him - Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas - 
17Est 1:11 to bring Queen Vashti to him with the royal crown on her head. He wanted the nobles and all the other men to gaze on her beauty, for she was a very beautiful woman.
17Est 1:12 But when they conveyed the king's order to Queen Vashti, she refused to come. This made the king furious, and he burned with anger.
17Est 1:13 He immediately consulted with his wise advisers, who knew all the Persian laws and customs, for he always asked their advice.
17Est 1:14 The names of these men were Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan - seven nobles of Persia and Media. They met with the king regularly and held the highest positions in the empire.
17Est 1:15 "What must be done to Queen Vashti?" the king demanded. "What penalty does the law provide for a queen who refuses to obey the king's orders, properly sent through his eunuchs?"
17Est 1:16 Memucan answered the king and his nobles, "Queen Vashti has wronged not only the king but also every noble and citizen throughout your empire.
17Est 1:17 Women everywhere will begin to despise their husbands when they learn that Queen Vashti has refused to appear before the king.
17Est 1:18 Before this day is out, the wives of all the king's nobles throughout Persia and Media will hear what the queen did and will start treating their husbands the same way. There will be no end to their contempt and anger.
17Est 1:19 "So if it please the king, we suggest that you issue a written decree, a law of the Persians and Medes that cannot be revoked. It should order that Queen Vashti be forever banished from the presence of King Xerxes, and that the king should choose another queen more worthy than she.
17Est 1:20 When this decree is published throughout the king's vast empire, husbands everywhere, whatever their rank, will receive proper respect from their wives!"
17Est 1:21 The king and his nobles thought this made good sense, so he followed Memucan's counsel.
17Est 1:22 He sent letters to all parts of the empire, to each province in its own script and language, proclaiming that every man should be the ruler of his own home and should say whatever he pleases��. / ��Or and should speak in the language of his own people
17Est 2:1 But after Xerxes' anger had subsided, he began thinking about Vashti and what she had done and the decree he had made.
17Est 2:2 So his personal attendants suggested, "Let us search the empire to find beautiful young virgins for the king.
17Est 2:3 Let the king appoint agents in each province to bring these beautiful young women into the royal harem at the fortress of Susa. Hegai, the king's eunuch in charge of the harem, will see that they are all given beauty treatments.
17Est 2:4 After that, the young woman who most pleases the king will be made queen instead of Vashti." This advice was very appealing to the king, so he put the plan into effect.
17Est 2:5 At that time there was a Jewish man in the fortress of Susa whose name was Mordecai son of Jair. He was from the tribe of Benjamin and was a descendant of Kish and Shimei.
17Est 2:6 His family�� had been among those who, with King Jehoiachin�� of Judah, had been exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar. / ��Hebrew He. ��Hebrew Jeconiah, a variant spelling of Jehoiachin
17Est 2:7 This man had a very beautiful and lovely young cousin, Hadassah, who was also called Esther. When her father and mother died, Mordecai adopted her into his family and raised her as his own daughter.
17Est 2:8 As a result of the king's decree, Esther, along with many other young women, was brought to the king's harem at the fortress of Susa and placed in Hegai's care.
17Est 2:9 Hegai was very impressed with Esther and treated her kindly. He quickly ordered a special menu for her and provided her with beauty treatments. He also assigned her seven maids specially chosen from the king's palace, and he moved her and her maids into the best place in the harem.
17Est 2:10 Esther had not told anyone of her nationality and family background, because Mordecai had directed her not to do so.
17Est 2:11 Every day Mordecai would take a walk near the courtyard of the harem to find out about Esther and what was happening to her.
17Est 2:12 Before each young woman was taken to the king's bed, she was given the prescribed twelve months of beauty treatments - six months with oil of myrrh, followed by six months with special perfumes and ointments.
17Est 2:13 When it was time for her to go to the king's palace, she was given her choice of whatever clothing or jewelry she wanted to take from the harem.
17Est 2:14 That evening she was taken to the king's private rooms, and the next morning she was brought to the second harem��, where the king's wives lived. There she would be under the care of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch in charge of the concubines. She would never go to the king again unless he had especially enjoyed her and requested her by name. / ��Or to another part of the harem
17Est 2:15 Esther was the daughter of Abihail, who was Mordecai's uncle. (Mordecai had adopted his younger cousin Esther.) When it was Esther's turn to go to the king, she accepted the advice of Hegai, the eunuch in charge of the harem. She asked for nothing except what he suggested, and she was admired by everyone who saw her.
17Est 2:16 Esther was taken to King Xerxes at the royal palace in early winter�� of the seventh year of his reign. / ��Hebrew in the tenth month, the month of Tebeth. A number of dates in the book of Esther can be cross-checked with dates in surviving Persian records and related accurately to our modern calendar. This month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred within the months of December 479 B.C. and January 478 B.C.
17Est 2:17 And the king loved Esther more than any of the other young women. He was so delighted with her that he set the royal crown on her head and declared her queen instead of Vashti.
17Est 2:18 To celebrate the occasion, he gave a great banquet in Esther's honor for all his nobles and officials, declaring a public holiday for the provinces and giving generous gifts to everyone.
17Est 2:19 Even after all the young women had been transferred to the second harem�� and Mordecai had become a palace official��, / ��The meaning of the Hebrew is uncertain. ��Hebrew and Mordecai was sitting in the gate of the king
17Est 2:20 Esther continued to keep her family background and nationality a secret. She was still following Mordecai's directions, just as she did when she lived in his home.
17Est 2:21 One day as Mordecai was on duty at the king's gate, two of the king's eunuchs, Bigthana�� and Teresh - who were guards at the door of the king's private quarters - became angry at King Xerxes and plotted to assassinate him. / ��Hebrew Bigthan; compare 6.2
17Est 2:22 But Mordecai heard about the plot and gave the information to Queen Esther. She then told the king about it and gave Mordecai credit for the report.
17Est 2:23 When an investigation was made and Mordecai's story was found to be true, the two men were impaled on a sharpened pole. This was all recorded in The Book of the History of King Xerxes' Reign.
17Est 3:1 Some time later King Xerxes promoted Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite over all the other nobles, making him the most powerful official in the empire.
17Est 3:2 All the king's officials would bow down before Haman to show him respect whenever he passed by, for so the king had commanded. But Mordecai refused to bow down or show him respect.
17Est 3:3 Then the palace officials at the king's gate asked Mordecai, "Why are you disobeying the king's command?"
17Est 3:4 They spoke to him day after day, but still he refused to comply with the order. So they spoke to Haman about this to see if he would tolerate Mordecai's conduct, since Mordecai had told them he was a Jew.
17Est 3:5 When Haman saw that Mordecai would not bow down or show him respect, he was filled with rage.
17Est 3:6 He had learned of Mordecai's nationality, so he decided it was not enough to lay hands on Mordecai alone. Instead, he looked for a way to destroy all the Jews throughout the entire empire of Xerxes.
17Est 3:7 So in the month of April��, during the twelfth year of King Xerxes' reign, lots were cast in Haman's presence (the lots were called purim) to determine the best day and month to take action. And the day selected was March 7, nearly a year later��. / ��Hebrew in the first month, the month of Nisan. This month of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar occurred within the months of April and May 474 B.C.; also see note on 2.16. ��As in 3.13, which reads the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar; Hebrew reads in the twelfth month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. The date selected was March 7, 473 B.C.; also see note on 2.16
17Est 3:8 Then Haman approached King Xerxes and said, "There is a certain race of people scattered through all the provinces of your empire who keep themselves separate from everyone else. Their laws are different from those of any other people, and they refuse to obey the laws of the king. So it is not in the king's interest to let them live.
17Est 3:9 If it please the king, issue a decree that they be destroyed, and I will give 10,000 large sacks�� of silver to the government administrators to be deposited in the royal treasury." / ��Hebrew 10,000 talents, about 375 tons or 340 metric tons in weight
17Est 3:10 The king agreed, confirming his decision by removing his signet ring from his finger and giving it to Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews.
17Est 3:11 The king said, "The money and the people are both yours to do with as you see fit."
17Est 3:12 So on April 17�� the king's secretaries were summoned, and a decree was written exactly as Haman dictated. It was sent to the king's highest officers, the governors of the respective provinces, and the nobles of each province in their own scripts and languages. The decree was written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with the king's signet ring. / ��Hebrew On the thirteenth day of the first month, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was April 17, 474 B.C.; also see note on 2.16
17Est 3:13 Dispatches were sent by swift messengers into all the provinces of the empire, giving the order that all Jews - young and old, including women and children - must be killed, slaughtered, and annihilated on a single day. This was scheduled to happen on March 7 of the next year��. The property of the Jews would be given to those who killed them. / ��Hebrew on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. The date selected was March 7, 473 B.C.; also see note on 2.16
17Est 3:14 A copy of this decree was to be issued as law in every province and proclaimed to all peoples, so that they would be ready to do their duty on the appointed day.
17Est 3:15 At the king's command, the decree went out by swift messengers, and it was also proclaimed in the fortress of Susa. Then the king and Haman sat down to drink, but the city of Susa fell into confusion.
17Est 4:1 When Mordecai learned about all that had been done, he tore his clothes, put on burlap and ashes, and went out into the city, crying with a loud and bitter wail.
17Est 4:2 He went as far as the gate of the palace, for no one was allowed to enter the palace gate while wearing clothes of mourning.
17Est 4:3 And as news of the king's decree reached all the provinces, there was great mourning among the Jews. They fasted, wept, and wailed, and many people lay in burlap and ashes.
17Est 4:4 When Queen Esther's maids and eunuchs came and told her about Mordecai, she was deeply distressed. She sent clothing to him to replace the burlap, but he refused it.
17Est 4:5 Then Esther sent for Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs who had been appointed as her attendant. She ordered him to go to Mordecai and find out what was troubling him and why he was in mourning.
17Est 4:6 So Hathach went out to Mordecai in the square in front of the palace gate.
17Est 4:7 Mordecai told him the whole story, including the exact amount of money Haman had promised to pay into the royal treasury for the destruction of the Jews.
17Est 4:8 Mordecai gave Hathach a copy of the decree issued in Susa that called for the death of all Jews. He asked Hathach to show it to Esther and explain the situation to her. He also asked Hathach to direct her to go to the king to beg for mercy and plead for her people.
17Est 4:9 So Hathach returned to Esther with Mordecai's message.
17Est 4:10 Then Esther told Hathach to go back and relay this message to Mordecai.
17Est 4:11 "All the king's officials and even the people in the provinces know that anyone who appears before the king in his inner court without being invited is doomed to die unless the king holds out his gold scepter. And the king has not called for me to come to him for thirty days."
17Est 4:12 So Hathach�� gave Esther's message to Mordecai. / ��As in Greek version; Hebrew reads they
17Est 4:13 Mordecai sent this reply to Esther�� "Don't think for a moment that because you're in the palace you will escape when all other Jews are killed.
17Est 4:14 If you keep quiet at a time like this, deliverance and relief for the Jews will arise from some other place, but you and your relatives will die. Who knows if perhaps you were made queen for just such a time as this?"
17Est 4:15 Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai.
17Est 4:16 "Go and gather together all the Jews of Susa and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. My maids and I will do the same. And then, though it is against the law, I will go in to see the king. If I must die, I must die."
17Est 4:17 So Mordecai went away and did everything as Esther had ordered him.
17Est 5:1 On the third day of the fast, Esther put on her royal robes and entered the inner court of the palace, just across from the king's hall. The king was sitting on his royal throne, facing the entrance.
17Est 5:2 When he saw Queen Esther standing there in the inner court, he welcomed her and held out the gold scepter to her. So Esther approached and touched the end of the scepter.
17Est 5:3 Then the king asked her, "What do you want, Queen Esther? What is your request? I will give it to you, even if it is half the kingdom!"
17Est 5:4 And Esther replied, "If it please the king, let the king and Haman come today to a banquet I have prepared for the king."
17Est 5:5 The king turned to his attendants and said, "Tell Haman to come quickly to a banquet, as Esther has requested." So the king and Haman went to Esther's banquet.
17Est 5:6 And while they were drinking wine, the king said to Esther, "Now tell me what you really want. What is your request? I will give it to you, even if it is half the kingdom!"
17Est 5:7 Esther replied, "This is my request and deepest wish.
17Est 5:8 If I have found favor with the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my request and do what I ask, please come with Haman tomorrow to the banquet I will prepare for you. Then I will explain what this is all about."
17Est 5:9 Haman was a happy man as he left the banquet! But when he saw Mordecai sitting at the palace gate, not standing up or trembling nervously before him, Haman became furious.
17Est 5:10 However, he restrained himself and went on home.Then Haman gathered together his friends and Zeresh, his wife,
17Est 5:11 and boasted to them about his great wealth and his many children. He bragged about the honors the king had given him and how he had been promoted over all the other nobles and officials.
17Est 5:12 Then Haman added, "And that's not all! Queen Esther invited only me and the king himself to the banquet she prepared for us. And she has invited me to dine with her and the king again tomorrow!"
17Est 5:13 Then he added, "But this is all worth nothing as long as I see Mordecai the Jew just sitting there at the palace gate."
17Est 5:14 So Haman's wife, Zeresh, and all his friends suggested, "Set up a sharpened pole that stands seventy-five feet�� tall, and in the morning ask the king to impale Mordecai on it. When this is done, you can go on your merry way to the banquet with the king." This pleased Haman, and he ordered the pole set up. / ��Hebrew 50 cubits [22.5 meters]
17Est 6:1 That night the king had trouble sleeping, so he ordered an attendant to bring the book of the history of his reign so it could be read to him.
17Est 6:2 In those records he discovered an account of how Mordecai had exposed the plot of Bigthana and Teresh, two of the eunuchs who guarded the door to the king's private quarters. They had plotted to assassinate King Xerxes.
17Est 6:3 "What reward or recognition did we ever give Mordecai for this?" the king asked.His attendants replied, "Nothing has been done for him."
17Est 6:4 "Who is that in the outer court?" the king inquired. As it happened, Haman had just arrived in the outer court of the palace to ask the king to impale Mordecai on the pole he had prepared.
17Est 6:5 So the attendants replied to the king, "Haman is out in the court." "Bring him in," the king ordered.
17Est 6:6 So Haman came in, and the king said, "What should I do to honor a man who truly pleases me?" Haman thought to himself, "Whom would the king wish to honor more than me?"
17Est 6:7 So he replied, "If the king wishes to honor someone,
17Est 6:8 he should bring out one of the king's own royal robes, as well as a horse that the king himself has ridden - one with a royal emblem on its head.
17Est 6:9 Let the robes and the horse be handed over to one of the king's most noble officials. And let him see that the man whom the king wishes to honor is dressed in the king's robes and led through the city square on the king's horse. Have the official shout as they go, 'This is what the king does for someone he wishes to honor!'"
17Est 6:10 "Excellent!" the king said to Haman. "Quick! Take the robes and my horse, and do just as you have said for Mordecai the Jew, who sits at the gate of the palace. Leave out nothing you have suggested!"
17Est 6:11 So Haman took the robes and put them on Mordecai, placed him on the king's own horse, and led him through the city square, shouting, "This is what the king does for someone he wishes to honor!"
17Est 6:12 Afterward Mordecai returned to the palace gate, but Haman hurried home dejected and completely humiliated.
17Est 6:13 When Haman told his wife, Zeresh, and all his friends what had happened, his wise advisers and his wife said, "Since Mordecai - this man who has humiliated you - is of Jewish birth, you will never succeed in your plans against him. It will be fatal to continue opposing him."
17Est 6:14 While they were still talking, the king's eunuchs arrived and quickly took Haman to the banquet Esther had prepared.
17Est 7:1 So the king and Haman went to Queen Esther's banquet.
17Est 7:2 On this second occasion, while they were drinking wine, the king again said to Esther, "Tell me what you want, Queen Esther. What is your request? I will give it to you, even if it is half the kingdom!"
17Est 7:3 Queen Esther replied, "If I have found favor with the king, and if it pleases the king to grant my request, I ask that my life and the lives of my people will be spared.
17Est 7:4 For my people and I have been sold to those who would kill, slaughter, and annihilate us. If we had merely been sold as slaves, I could remain quiet, for that would be too trivial a matter to warrant disturbing the king."
17Est 7:5 "Who would do such a thing?" King Xerxes demanded. "Who would be so presumptuous as to touch you?"
17Est 7:6 Esther replied, "This wicked Haman is our adversary and our enemy." Haman grew pale with fright before the king and queen.
17Est 7:7 Then the king jumped to his feet in a rage and went out into the palace garden.Haman, however, stayed behind to plead for his life with Queen Esther, for he knew that the king intended to kill him.
17Est 7:8 In despair he fell on the couch where Queen Esther was reclining, just as the king was returning from the palace garden.The king exclaimed, "Will he even assault the queen right here in the palace, before my very eyes?" And as soon as the king spoke, his attendants covered Haman's face, signaling his doom.
17Est 7:9 Then Harbona, one of the king's eunuchs, said, "Haman has set up a sharpened pole that stands seventy-five feet�� tall in his own courtyard. He intended to use it to impale Mordecai, the man who saved the king from assassination." "Then impale Haman on it!" the king ordered. / ��Hebrew 50 cubits [22.5 meters]
17Est 7:10 So they impaled Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai, and the king's anger subsided.
17Est 8:1 On that same day King Xerxes gave the property of Haman, the enemy of the Jews, to Queen Esther. Then Mordecai was brought before the king, for Esther had told the king how they were related.
17Est 8:2 The king took off his signet ring - which he had taken back from Haman - and gave it to Mordecai. And Esther appointed Mordecai to be in charge of Haman's property.
17Est 8:3 Then Esther went again before the king, falling down at his feet and begging him with tears to stop the evil plot devised by Haman the Agagite against the Jews.
17Est 8:4 Again the king held out the gold scepter to Esther. So she rose and stood before him.
17Est 8:5 Esther said, "If it please the king, and if I have found favor with him, and if he thinks it is right, and if I am pleasing to him, let there be a decree that reverses the orders of Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, who ordered that Jews throughout all the king's provinces should be destroyed.
17Est 8:6 For how can I endure to see my people and my family slaughtered and destroyed?"
17Est 8:7 Then King Xerxes said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, "I have given Esther the property of Haman, and he has been impaled on a pole because he tried to destroy the Jews.
17Est 8:8 Now go ahead and send a message to the Jews in the king's name, telling them whatever you want, and seal it with the king's signet ring. But remember that whatever has already been written in the king's name and sealed with his signet ring can never be revoked."
17Est 8:9 So on June 25�� the king's secretaries were summoned, and a decree was written exactly as Mordecai dictated. It was sent to the Jews and to the highest officers, the governors, and the nobles of all the 127 provinces stretching from India to Ethiopia��. The decree was written in the scripts and languages of all the peoples of the empire, including that of the Jews. / ��Hebrew on the twenty-third day of the third month, the month of Sivan, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was June 25, 474 B.C.; also see note on 2.16. ��Hebrew to Cush
17Est 8:10 The decree was written in the name of King Xerxes and sealed with the king's signet ring. Mordecai sent the dispatches by swift messengers, who rode fast horses especially bred for the king's service.
17Est 8:11 The king's decree gave the Jews in every city authority to unite to defend their lives. They were allowed to kill, slaughter, and annihilate anyone of any nationality or province who might attack them or their children and wives, and to take the property of their enemies.
17Est 8:12 The day chosen for this event throughout all the provinces of King Xerxes was March 7 of the next year��. / ��Hebrew the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. The date selected was March 7, 473 B.C.; also see note on 2.16
17Est 8:13 A copy of this decree was to be issued as law in every province and proclaimed to all peoples, so that the Jews would be ready to take revenge on their enemies on the appointed day.
17Est 8:14 So urged on by the king's command, the messengers rode out swiftly on fast horses bred for the king's service. The same decree was also proclaimed in the fortress of Susa.
17Est 8:15 Then Mordecai left the king's presence, wearing the royal robe of blue and white, the great crown of gold, and an outer cloak of fine linen and purple. And the people of Susa celebrated the new decree.
17Est 8:16 The Jews were filled with joy and gladness and were honored everywhere.
17Est 8:17 In every province and city, wherever the king's decree arrived, the Jews rejoiced and had a great celebration and declared a public festival and holiday. And many of the people of the land became Jews themselves, for they feared what the Jews might do to them.
17Est 9:1 So on March 7�� the two decrees of the king were put into effect. On that day, the enemies of the Jews had hoped to overpower them, but quite the opposite happened. It was the Jews who overpowered their enemies. / ��Hebrew on the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, the month of Adar, of the ancient Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was March 7, 473 B.C.; also see note on 2.16
17Est 9:2 The Jews gathered in their cities throughout all the king's provinces to attack anyone who tried to harm them. But no one could make a stand against them, for everyone was afraid of them.
17Est 9:3 And all the nobles of the provinces, the highest officers, the governors, and the royal officials helped the Jews for fear of Mordecai.
17Est 9:4 For Mordecai had been promoted in the king's palace, and his fame spread throughout all the provinces as he became more and more powerful.
17Est 9:5 So the Jews went ahead on the appointed day and struck down their enemies with the sword. They killed and annihilated their enemies and did as they pleased with those who hated them.
17Est 9:6 In the fortress of Susa itself, the Jews killed 500 men.
17Est 9:7 They also killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha,
17Est 9:8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha,
17Est 9:9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha - 
17Est 9:10 the ten sons of Haman son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the Jews. But they did not take any plunder.
17Est 9:11 That very day, when the king was informed of the number of people killed in the fortress of Susa,
17Est 9:12 he called for Queen Esther. He said, "The Jews have killed 500 men in the fortress of Susa alone, as well as Haman's ten sons. If they have done that here, what has happened in the rest of the provinces? But now, what more do you want? It will be granted to you; tell me and I will do it."
17Est 9:13 Esther responded, "If it please the king, give the Jews in Susa permission to do again tomorrow as they have done today, and let the bodies of Haman's ten sons be impaled on a pole."
17Est 9:14 So the king agreed, and the decree was announced in Susa. And they impaled the bodies of Haman's ten sons.
17Est 9:15 Then the Jews at Susa gathered together on March 8�� and killed 300 more men, and again they took no plunder. / ��Hebrew the fourteenth day of the month of Adar, of the Hebrew lunar calendar. This day was March 8, 473 B.C.; also see note on 2.16
17Est 9:16 Meanwhile, the other Jews throughout the king's provinces had gathered together to defend their lives. They gained relief from all their enemies, killing 75,000 of those who hated them. But they did not take any plunder.
17Est 9:17 This was done throughout the provinces on March 7, and on March 8 they rested��, celebrating their victory with a day of feasting and gladness. / ��Hebrew on the thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and on the fourteenth day they rested. These days were March 7 and 8, 473 B.C.; also see note on 2.16
17Est 9:18 (The Jews at Susa killed their enemies on March 7 and again on March 8, then rested on March 9��, making that their day of feasting and gladness.) / ��Hebrew killed their enemies on the thirteenth day and the fourteenth day, and then rested on the fifteenth day, of the Hebrew month of Adar
17Est 9:19 So to this day, rural Jews living in remote villages celebrate an annual festival and holiday on the appointed day in late winter��, when they rejoice and send gifts of food to each other. / ��Hebrew on the fourteenth day of the month of Adar. This day of the Hebrew lunar calendar occurs in February or March
17Est 9:20 Mordecai recorded these events and sent letters to the Jews near and far, throughout all the provinces of King Xerxes,
17Est 9:21 calling on them to celebrate an annual festival on these two days��. / ��Hebrew on the fourteenth and fifteenth days of Adar, of the Hebrew lunar calendar
17Est 9:22 He told them to celebrate these days with feasting and gladness and by giving gifts of food to each other and presents to the poor. This would commemorate a time when the Jews gained relief from their enemies, when their sorrow was turned into gladness and their mourning into joy.
17Est 9:23 So the Jews accepted Mordecai's proposal and adopted this annual custom.
17Est 9:24 Haman son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the enemy of the Jews, had plotted to crush and destroy them on the date determined by casting lots (the lots were called purim).
17Est 9:25 But when Esther came before the king, he issued a decree causing Haman's evil plot to backfire, and Haman and his sons were impaled on a sharpened pole.
17Est 9:26 That is why this celebration is called Purim, because it is the ancient word for casting lots. So because of Mordecai's letter and because of what they had experienced,
17Est 9:27 the Jews throughout the realm agreed to inaugurate this tradition and to pass it on to their descendants and to all who became Jews. They declared they would never fail to celebrate these two prescribed days at the appointed time each year.
17Est 9:28 These days would be remembered and kept from generation to generation and celebrated by every family throughout the provinces and cities of the empire. This Festival of Purim would never cease to be celebrated among the Jews, nor would the memory of what happened ever die out among their descendants.
17Est 9:29 Then Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, along with Mordecai the Jew, wrote another letter putting the queen's full authority behind Mordecai's letter to establish the Festival of Purim.
17Est 9:30 Letters wishing peace and security were sent to the Jews throughout the 127 provinces of the empire of Xerxes.
17Est 9:31 These letters established the Festival of Purim - an annual celebration of these days at the appointed time, decreed by both Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther. (The people decided to observe this festival, just as they had decided for themselves and their descendants to establish the times of fasting and mourning.)
17Est 9:32 So the command of Esther confirmed the practices of Purim, and it was all written down in the records.
17Est 10:1 King Xerxes imposed a tribute throughout his empire, even to the distant coastlands.
17Est 10:2 His great achievements and the full account of the greatness of Mordecai, whom the king had promoted, are recorded in The Book of the History of the Kings of Media and Persia.
17Est 10:3 Mordecai the Jew became the prime minister, with authority next to that of King Xerxes himself. He was very great among the Jews, who held him in high esteem, because he continued to work for the good of his people and to speak up for the welfare of all their descendants.
