24Jr 1:1 The words of Hilkiah's son Jeremiah, who was one of the priests at Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin.
24Jr 1:2 The word of the Lord came to him during the thirteen year of the reign of Ammon's son Josiah, the king of Judah
24Jr 1:3 and during the reign of Josiah's son Jehoiakim, the king of Judah, and continued until the exile of Jerusalem in the fifth month, at the end of the eleventh year of the reign of Josiah's son Zedekiah, the king of Judah.
24Jr 1:4 The word of the Lord came to me£º 
24Jr 1:5 "I knew you before I formed you in the womb; I set you apart for me before you were born; I appointed you to be a prophet to the nations."
24Jr 1:6 I replied, "Ah, Lord God! Look, I don't know how to speak, because I'm only a young man."
24Jr 1:7 Then the Lord said to me, "Don't say, 'I'm only a young man,' for you will go everywhere I send you, and you will speak everything I command you.
24Jr 1:8 Don't be afraid of them, because I am with you to deliver you," declares the Lord.
24Jr 1:9 The Lord stretched out his hand, touched my mouth, and then said to me, "Look, I've put my words in your mouth.
24Jr 1:10 See, today I've appointed you to prophesy about nations and kingdoms, to pull up and tear down, to destroy and overthrow, to build and to plant."
24Jr 1:11 The word of the Lord came to me, asking, "What do you see, Jeremiah? I replied, "I see an almond branch."
24Jr 1:12 The Lord said to me, "You have observed well, because I'm watching over my word, to make sure it comes about."
24Jr 1:13 The word of the Lord came to me a second time£º "What do you see? I replied, "I see a boiling pot, and its mouth is tilted away from the north."
24Jr 1:14 Then the Lord said to me, "From the north disaster will pour out on all who live in the land,
24Jr 1:15 because I'm about to summon all the families and kingdoms1from the north," declares the Lord. "They'll come and each one will set up his seat at the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, against all of its surrounding walls, and against all of the towns of Judah.
24Jr 1:16 "I'll pronounce my judgments against them because of all their wickedness. They have forsaken me, they have burned incense to other gods, and they have bowed down in worship to the works of their own hands."
24Jr 1:17 "As for you, get ready! Stand up and tell them everything that I've commanded you. Don't be frightened as you face them, or I'll frighten you right in front of them. 
24Jr 1:18 "As for me, today I'm making you a fortified city, an iron pillar, and a bronze wall against the whole land - against the kings of Judah, against its princes, against its priests, and against the people of the land.
24Jr 1:19 They'll fight against you, but they won't prevail against you, because I am with you," declares the Lord, "to deliver you."
24Jr 2:1 The word of the Lord came to me£º 
24Jr 2:2 "Go and announce to Jerusalem£º 'This is what the Lord says£º "I remember the loyal devotion of your youth, your love as a bride. You followed me in the desert, in a land that was not planted.
24Jr 2:3 Israel was consecrated to the Lord, she was the first fruits of his produce. All who devoured her became guilty and disaster came on them," declares the Lord.'"
24Jr 2:4 Listen to the word of the Lord, you descendants of Jacob and all the families of the descendants of Israel.
24Jr 2:5 This is what the Lord says£º "What did your ancestors find wrong with me that they left me, and pursued worthless things, and so they became worthless - 
24Jr 2:6 "They didn't say, 'Where is the Lord who brought us up from the land of Egypt, who led us through the wilderness, through the land of desert and pits, through the land of dryness and deep darkness, a land that people don't pass through, and where no one lives? 
24Jr 2:7 "I brought you into the fruitful land to eat its fruit and its good things. But you came in, defiled my land, and made my inheritance into an abomination.
24Jr 2:8 "The priests didn't say, 'Where is the Lord? and those handling the law didn't know me. The rulers transgressed against me, the prophets prophesied by Baal, and they followed that which does not profit.
24Jr 2:9 "Therefore I'll again accuse you," declares the Lord, "and I'll accuse your grandchildren."
24Jr 2:10 "Indeed, go over to the coasts of Cyprus and see, send to Kedar and pay very close attention. See if there has ever been such a thing as this!
24Jr 2:11 Has a nation ever changed gods when they aren't even gods?But my people have exchanged their glory for that which does not profit.
24Jr 2:12 Heavens, be appalled at this, be shocked, be utterly devastated," declares the Lord.
24Jr 2:13 ""Indeed, my people have committed two evils£º they have forsaken me, the fountain of living water, and they have dug cisterns for themselves, broken cisterns that cannot hold water."
24Jr 2:14 "Is Israel a slave, or was he born a servant?Why then has he become plunder?
24Jr 2:15 Young lions roar at him, they cry out loudly. They have made his land into a wasteland, and his cities are destroyed so they are without inhabitants.
24Jr 2:16 Also, people from Memphis and Tahpanhes have broken your skull. 
24Jr 2:17 You have done this to yourselves, have you not, by forsaking the Lord your God, when he is the one who led you on the way.
24Jr 2:18 Now, what are you doing on the road to Egypt, to drink the waters of the Nile?And what are you doing on the road to Assyria, to drink the waters of the Euphrates?
24Jr 2:19 Your wickedness will be punished, and you will be corrected due to your acts of apostasy. Know and see that it's evil and bitter for you to forsake the Lord your God, but the fear of me is not in you," declares the Lord GOD of the Heavenly Armies.
24Jr 2:20 "For long ago I broke your yoke and tore off your bonds, But you said, 'I won't serve you!' Instead on every high hill and under every green tree, you bend down to commit fornication.
24Jr 2:21 I planted you myself as a choice vine, from the very best seed. How did you turn against me into a degenerate and foreign vine - 
24Jr 2:22 Though you wash yourself with lye and use much soap, the stain of your guilt is still before me," declares the Lord GOD.
24Jr 2:23 "How can you say, 'I'm not defiled. I haven't gone after the Baals? Look at what you've done in the valley. Know what you have done. You are a swift young camel galloping aimlessly,
24Jr 2:24 a wild donkey accustomed to the desert, sniffing the wind in her passion. When she's in heat, who can turn her away?None of the males who pursue her need to tire themselves out, for in her month they'll find her."
24Jr 2:25 "Don't run until your feet are bare and your throat is dry. But you say, 'It's hopeless! Because I love foreign gods, I'll go after them!'"
24Jr 2:26 "As a thief is disgraced when he's caught, so the house of Israel is disgraced, they, their kings, their princes, their priests, and their prophets,
24Jr 2:27 who say to a tree, 'You are my father,' and to a stone, 'You gave birth to me.' They have turned their back to me, but not their faces. In the time of their trouble, they'll say, 'Rise up! Deliver us!'"
24Jr 2:28 "But where are your gods that you made for yourselves?Let them rise up, if they can deliver you in the time of your trouble. You have as many gods as you have towns, Judah.
24Jr 2:29 Why do you contend with me?You have rebelled against me," declares the Lord.
24Jr 2:30 "I've punished your children with no results, they have accepted no discipline. Your sword has devoured your prophets like a destroying lion."
24Jr 2:31 "You, generation, pay attention to the word of the Lord! Am I the desert to Israel, or a land of gloom?Why do my people say, 'We're free to roam?We won't come to you any more.'2
24Jr 2:32 Will a young woman forget her wedding ornaments, or a bride her attire?But my people have forgotten me days without number.
24Jr 2:33 How well you perfect your techniques for seeking love. Therefore you can teach even the most immoral women your techniques.
24Jr 2:34 On your skirts is found the lifeblood of the innocent poor, even though you didn't catch them breaking in. Yet despite all these things,
24Jr 2:35 you say, 'I'm innocent. Surely his anger has turned away from me.'" "I'm about to bring charges against you because you say, 'I haven't sinned.'
24Jr 2:36 Why do you go about changing your mind so much?You will also be disappointed by Egypt, just as you were disappointed by Assyria.
24Jr 2:37 You will also go out from this place with your hands over your heads. For the Lord has rejected those in whom you trust, and you won't prosper through them."
24Jr 3:1 "When a man divorces his wife, she leaves him and becomes another man's wife, will the first husband return to her again?The land would be deeply polluted, would it not?Since you have committed fornication with many lovers, would you now return to me? declares the Lord.
24Jr 3:2 "Look up to the barren heights and see. Is there any place where you have not been ravished?You have sat beside the road, waiting for them like a nomad in the desert. And you have polluted the land with your fornication and your wickedness.
24Jr 3:3 This is why the rain has been withheld and there are no spring showers. Yet you have a harlot's look and you refused to be ashamed.
24Jr 3:4 Have you not just called out to me, 'My father, you are the friend of my youth - 
24Jr 3:5 will he hold on to his anger forever, will he persist in his wrath to the end? Look, you have spoken and done evil things, and you have succeeded in it."
24Jr 3:6 In the time of King Josiah the Lord said to me, "Have you seen what unfaithful Israel did?She went up on every high hill and under every green tree, and she committed fornication there.
24Jr 3:7 I thought, 'After she has done all these things, she will return to me.' But she didn't return, and her treacherous sister Judah saw this.
24Jr 3:8 I saw that even though I had sent unfaithful Israel away for all her adulteries and had given her a divorce decree, her treacherous sister Judah didn't fear, and she, too, committed adultery.
24Jr 3:9 She took her fornication so lightly that she polluted the land and committed adultery with stones and trees.
24Jr 3:10 Yet in all this her treacherous sister Judah didn't return to me with her whole heart, but rather deceptively," declares the Lord.
24Jr 3:11 Then the Lord said to me, "Unfaithful Israel has shown herself more righteous than treacherous Judah.
24Jr 3:12 Go, proclaim these words to the north, and say, 'Return, unfaithful Israel,' declares the Lord. 'I won't look on you in anger, for I am gracious,' declares the Lord. 'I won't remain angry forever.
24Jr 3:13 'Only acknowledge your iniquity, that you have rebelled against the Lord your God, and have scattered your favors to strangers under every green tree. But you haven't obeyed me,' declares the Lord.
24Jr 3:14 "Return, unfaithful people," declares the Lord, "for I am your husband. I'll take you, one from a city and two from a family, and I'll bring you to Zion.
24Jr 3:15 I'll give you shepherds after my own heart, and they'll shepherd you with knowledge and good sense."
24Jr 3:16 "And in those days when you increase in numbers and multiply in the land," declares the Lord, "people will no longer say, 'The Ark of the Covenant of the Lord,' and it won't come to mind, and they won't remember it or miss it, nor will it be made again.
24Jr 3:17 At that time people will call Jerusalem "The Throne of the Lord," and all the nations will be gathered to it, to the name of the Lord, to Jerusalem. They'll no longer stubbornly follow their own evil desires.
24Jr 3:18 In those days the house of Judah will walk with the house of Israel, and together they'll come to the land that I gave your ancestors as an inheritance."
24Jr 3:19 "I said, 'How I wanted to treat you like children, and give you a pleasant land, the most beautiful inheritance of the nations.' I said, 'You will call me, my father, and won't turn back from following me.'
24Jr 3:20 Instead, like an unfaithful wife leaves her husband, so you have been unfaithful to me, house of Israel," declares the Lord.
24Jr 3:21 "A voice is heard on the barren heights, the weeping and pleading of the children of Israel because they have perverted their way. They have forgotten the Lord their God."
24Jr 3:22 "Turn back, unfaithful people, and I'll heal your unfaithfulness." "Look, we're coming to you because you are the Lord our God.
24Jr 3:23 Truly the hills are a deception, and the mountains are confusion. Truly, in the Lord our God is Israel's salvation."
24Jr 3:24 Since our youth the false gods have consumed the products of our ancestors' hard work, their sheep and their cattle, their sons and their daughters.
24Jr 3:25 "Let us lie down in our shame, and let our humiliation cover us, because both we and our ancestors have sinned against the Lord our God from our youth until this present time. We haven't obeyed the Lord our God."
24Jr 4:1 "Israel, if you return to me," declares the Lord, "Return to me, remove your detestable idols from my presence, and don't waver.
24Jr 4:2 If you swear, 'as surely as the Lord lives,' in truth, in justice, and in righteousness, then nations will be blessed by him, and in him they will boast."
24Jr 4:3 For this is what the Lord says to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, "Break up your unplowed ground, and don't sow among thorns.
24Jr 4:4 Circumcise yourselves to the Lord and remove the foreskin of your heart, you men of Judah and residents of Jerusalem, or else my wrath will break out like fire and burn with no one to put it out, because of your evil deeds."
24Jr 4:5 Declare in Judah, make known in Jerusalem, by saying, "Blow the trumpet in the land, cry out, and say, 'Gather together and let's go to the fortified cities!'
24Jr 4:6 Raise a standard in the direction of Zion. Flee! Don't stand around! For I'm bringing calamity from the north, along with great destruction.
24Jr 4:7 A lion has gone up from his thicket, and a destroyer of nations has set out. He has left his place to make your land a waste. Your cities will be ruined, and without inhabitants.
24Jr 4:8 So, put on sackcloth, mourn and wail, because the burning anger of the Lord has not turned away from us."
24Jr 4:9 "On that day," declares the Lord, "the courage of the king and the leaders will fail. The priests will be appalled and the prophets astounded."
24Jr 4:10 Then I replied, "Ah, Lord GOD, you have completely deceived this people and Jerusalem when you said, 'You will have peace,' while the sword is at their throat!"
24Jr 4:11 At that time, it will be said to this people and to Jerusalem, "A scorching wind from the barren heights in the desert is coming toward my people, and it's not for winnowing or cleansing.
24Jr 4:12 A wind too strong for that is coming at my bidding. Now I'm judging them as I speak."
24Jr 4:13 Look, he comes up like clouds, and his chariots are like a whirlwind. His horses are as swift as eagles. Woe to us?we're destroyed!
24Jr 4:14 Jerusalem, wash your evil from your heart so that you may be delivered. How long will you harbor evil schemes within you - 
24Jr 4:15 For a voice announces from Dan and declares disaster from Mount Ephraim.
24Jr 4:16 "Tell the nations, 'Here they come!' Proclaim to Jerusalem, 'The besieging forces are coming from a distant land. They cry out against the cities of Judah.
24Jr 4:17 They have surrounded her like those guarding a field because they have rebelled against me,'" declares the Lord.
24Jr 4:18 "Your lifestyles and your actions have brought these things on you. This is your calamity - it is indeed bitter, for it has reached your heart!"
24Jr 4:19 "My anguish, my anguish! I writhe in pain. Oh, the aching of my heart! My heart pounds within me; I cannot keep silent. For I hear the sound of the trumpet, the alarm for war.
24Jr 4:20 Disaster upon disaster is proclaimed, for the entire land is devastated. Suddenly my tent is destroyed, in a moment my curtains.
24Jr 4:21 How long will I see the battle standard and hear the sound of the trumpet - 
24Jr 4:22 "For my people are foolish, they don't know me. They're stupid children, they have no understanding. They're skilled at doing evil, but how to do good, they don't know."
24Jr 4:23 I looked at the earth, and it was formless and void, at the heavens, and there was no light there.
24Jr 4:24 I looked at the mountains; they were quaking, and all the hills moved back and forth.
24Jr 4:25 I looked, and no people were there. All the birds of the sky had gone.
24Jr 4:26 I looked, and the fruitful land had become a desert. All its towns were broken down because of the Lord, because of his burning anger.
24Jr 4:27 For this is what the Lord says£º "The entire land will be devastated, but I won't completely destroy it.
24Jr 4:28 Because of this, the land will mourn, and the heavens above will be dark. Because I have spoken and decided, I won't turn back from doing it."
24Jr 4:29 At the sound of the horseman and the archer the entire city flees. Its residents go into the thickets and climb among the rocks. Every city is abandoned, and no one lives in them.
24Jr 4:30 You are ruined! What are you doing dressing in scarlet, putting on golden ornaments, and highlighting your eyes with makeup?You are making yourself beautiful in vain. Your lovers reject you?they're out to kill you.
24Jr 4:31 I heard a cry like that of a woman in labor, anguish like one giving birth to her first born, the cry of the daughter of Zion gasping for air, stretching out her hand£º "Woe is me! I'm about to faint in front of killers!"
24Jr 5:1 Wander through the streets of Jerusalem. Look and investigate; search through her squares and see whether you find anyone?even one person there - doing justice and seeking truth. Then I'll forgive them.
24Jr 5:2 Although they say, 'As surely as the Lord lives,' still they are swearing falsely."
24Jr 5:3 Lord, don't your eyes look for truth?You struck them, but they didn't flinch. You brought them to an end, but they refused to receive discipline. They made their faces harder than stone, and they refused to repent.
24Jr 5:4 Then I said, "These are only the poor, they're foolish, for they don't know the Lord's way, the requirement of their God.
24Jr 5:5 Let me go to the leaders and speak to them. For they know the Lord's way, the requirement of their God." "But they, all together, have broken the yoke and torn off the restraints.
24Jr 5:6 Therefore a lion from the forest will attack them, a wolf from the desert will devastate them. A leopard is watching their towns, and everyone who goes out of them will be torn to pieces. For their transgressions are many, and their apostasies numerous.
24Jr 5:7 Why should I forgive you?Your sons have forsaken me, and you have sworn by those who aren't gods. When I gave them enough food to satisfy them, they committed adultery and marched to the prostitute's house.
24Jr 5:8 They were well-fed, lusty stallions, each one neighing after his neighbor's wife.
24Jr 5:9 "Should I not punish them for these things? asks the Lord, "And on a nation like this, should I not seek retribution?
24Jr 5:10 "Go through her rows of vines and destroy them, but don't completely destroy them. Strip away her branches, because they aren't the Lord's.
24Jr 5:11 For both the house of Israel and the house of Judah have been utterly unfaithful to me," declares the Lord.
24Jr 5:12 They have lied about the Lord by saying, 'He wouldn't do that! Disaster won't come on us. We won't see sword and famine.
24Jr 5:13 The prophets are nothing but wind, and the word is not in them. So may the disaster happen to them!
24Jr 5:14 Therefore, this is what the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Because you people have said this, my words in your mouth will become a fire and these people the wood. The fire will destroy them.
24Jr 5:15 People of Israel, I'm now bringing a nation from far away to attack you," declares the Lord. "It is an enduring nation, an ancient nation, a nation whose language you don't know. And you won't understand what they say.
24Jr 5:16 Their quiver is like an open grave, and all of them are powerful warriors.
24Jr 5:17 "They'll devour your harvest and your food. They'll devour your sons and your daughters. They'll devour your vines and your fig trees. With their swords they'll batter down your fortified cities in which you trust.
24Jr 5:18 "Yet even in those days," declares the Lord, "I won't destroy you completely.
24Jr 5:19 When the people ask, 'Why has the Lord our God done all this to us? you are to say to them, 'Just as you have forsaken me and served foreign gods in your land, so you will serve strangers in a land that is not yours.'"
24Jr 5:20 "Declare this to the descendants of Jacob, and proclaim it in Judah£º 
24Jr 5:21 'Hear this, you foolish and stupid people£º They have eyes, but don't see; they have ears, but don't hear.
24Jr 5:22 'You don't fear me, do you? declares the Lord. 'You don't tremble before me, do you?I'm the one who put the sand as a boundary for the sea, a perpetual barrier that it cannot cross. Though the waves toss, they cannot prevail against it, though they roar, they cannot cross it.
24Jr 5:23 But these people have stubborn and rebellious hearts. They have turned aside and have gone away.
24Jr 5:24 They don't say to themselves, "Let's fear the Lord our God, who gives rain in its season, both the autumn and the spring rain. He sets aside for us the weeks appointed for the harvest."
24Jr 5:25 'Your iniquities have turned these things away, and your sins have held back from you what is good.
24Jr 5:26 "Evil men are found among my people. They lie in wait like someone who traps birds. They set a trap, but they do so to catch people.
24Jr 5:27 'Like a cage full of birds, so their houses are filled with treachery. This is how they have become prominent and rich,
24Jr 5:28 and have grown fat and sleek. There is no limit to their evil deeds. They don't argue the case of the orphan to secure justice. They don't defend the rights of the poor.
24Jr 5:29 'Should I not punish them for this - ,' asks the Lord, 'Should I not avenge myself on a nation like this?
24Jr 5:30 "An appalling and horrible thing has happened in the land.
24Jr 5:31 "The prophets prophesy falsely, the priests rule by their own authority, and my people love it this way. But what will you do in the end - 
24Jr 6:1 "Flee to safety, you people of Benjamin, leave Jerusalem. Sound the trumpet in Tekoa, and raise a signal over Beth-haccerem! For calamity and terrible destruction are turning toward you from the north.
24Jr 6:2 I'll destroy the lovely and delicate Daughter of Zion.
24Jr 6:3 "Shepherds and their flocks will come against her. They'll pitch their tents all around her, and every one will tend his flock in his own place.
24Jr 6:4 Prepare for war against her. Get ready, let's attack at noon! How terrible for us that the day is coming to an end, and that the evening shadows are lengthening.
24Jr 6:5 Get ready, let's attack at night, and destroy her fortresses."
24Jr 6:6 For this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Cut down trees and set up siege works against Jerusalem. It is the city to be judged, and there is oppression throughout the entire city. 
24Jr 6:7 As a well keeps its waters fresh, so the city keeps her wickedness fresh. Violence and destruction are heard in her, sickness and wounds are always before me.
24Jr 6:8 "Be warned, Jerusalem, or I'll be alienated from you. I'll make you desolate, a land not inhabited."
24Jr 6:9 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Let them glean the remnant of Israel as thoroughly as they would the vine. Pass your hand over them like grape gatherers over the branches.
24Jr 6:10 To whom shall I speak and give a warning so they'll listen?Look, their ears are closed, and they cannot hear. Look, the word of the Lord is contemptible to them; they don't delight in it.
24Jr 6:11 I'm full of the wrath of the Lord, and I'm tired of holding it back. Pour it out on the children in the street and on the groups of young men gathered together. Indeed, both husband and wife will be caught in it, the old and the very old.
24Jr 6:12 "Their houses will be turned over to others?their fields and wives together?when I stretch out my hand against those who live in the land," declares the Lord.
24Jr 6:13 Indeed, from the least important to the most important, they're all greedy for dishonest gain. From prophet to priest, they all act deceitfully.
24Jr 6:14 They treated my people's wound superficially, telling them, 'Peace, peace,' but there is no peace.
24Jr 6:15 Were they ashamed because they did what was repugnant to God?They were not ashamed at all?they don't even know how to blush! Therefore they'll fall with those who fall. When I punish them, they'll be brought down," says the Lord.
24Jr 6:16 This is what the Lord says£º "Stand beside the roads and watch. Ask for the ancient paths, where the good way is. Walk in it and find rest for yourselves. But they said, 'We won't walk in it!'
24Jr 6:17 I appointed watchmen over you. Listen for the sound of the trumpet. But they said, 'We won't listen!'
24Jr 6:18 Therefore, hear, nations, and know, congregation, what will happen to them.
24Jr 6:19 Listen, earth! I'm about to bring calamity on this people, on the fruit of their plans, because they didn't listen to my words and they rejected my instruction.
24Jr 6:20 What good is frankincense that comes from Sheba to me, or sweet cane from a distant country?Your burnt offerings aren't acceptable, nor are your sacrifices pleasing to me."
24Jr 6:21 Therefore, this is what the Lord says£º "I'm about to put stumbling blocks in front of this people, and fathers and sons will stumble over them together. The neighbor and his friends will perish."
24Jr 6:22 This is what the Lord says£º "Look, people are coming from a northern country. A great nation is stirring from the ends of the earth.
24Jr 6:23 They grab bow and spear; they're cruel and show no mercy. Their sound roars like the sea as they ride on horses, deployed like men ready for battle against you, daughter of Zion."
24Jr 6:24 We have heard the news about it, and our hands are limp. Distress has seized us like a woman in labor.
24Jr 6:25 Don't go out into the field, and don't travel on the road, because the enemy has a sword, and terror is on every side.
24Jr 6:26 Daughter of my people, put on sackcloth and roll in ashes. Mourn with bitter wailing, as one mourns at the death of an only son. For the destroyer will come on us suddenly.
24Jr 6:27 "I've made you an assayer of my people, as well as a fortress. You know how to test their way."
24Jr 6:28 All of them are very rebellious, going around as slanderers. They're bronze and iron, and all of them are corrupt.
24Jr 6:29 The bellows blow fiercely to consume the lead with the fire. The assayer keeps on refining, but the impurities aren't separated out.
24Jr 6:30 They're called reject silver, because the Lord has rejected them.
24Jr 7:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord£º 
24Jr 7:2 "Stand at the gate of the LORD's temple and proclaim this message there. Say, 'Listen to this message from the Lord, all you people of Judah who come through these gates to worship the Lord.'"
24Jr 7:3 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "Change your ways and your deeds, and I'll let you live in this place.
24Jr 7:4 Don't trust deceptive words like these, and say, 'The temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord,'
24Jr 7:5 but rather, truly change your ways and your deeds. If you truly practice justice between each person and his neighbor,
24Jr 7:6 and if you don't oppress the alien, the orphan, and the widow, and don't shed an innocent person's blood in this place, and if you don't follow other gods to your own harm,
24Jr 7:7 then I'll let you dwell in this land, the land that I gave to your ancestors forever and ever.3
24Jr 7:8 "Look, you're trusting in deceptive words that cannot benefit.
24Jr 7:9 Will you steal, murder, commit adultery, swear by false gods, burn incense to Baal, follow other gods that you don't know,
24Jr 7:10 and then come to stand before me in this house that is called by my name and say, 'We're delivered' so we can continue to do all these things that are repugnant to God - 
24Jr 7:11 Has this house that is called by my name become a hideout for bandits in your eyes?Look, I'm watching," declares the Lord.
24Jr 7:12 "Go to my place that was in Shiloh, where I first caused my name to dwell. See what I did to it because of the evil of my people Israel.
24Jr 7:13 Now, because you have done all these things," declares the Lord, "I spoke to you over and over again, but you didn't listen. I called to you, but you didn't answer.
24Jr 7:14 Just as I did to Shiloh, I'll do to the house in which you trust and which is called by my name, the place that I gave to you and your ancestors.
24Jr 7:15 I'll cast you out of my sight, just as I cast out all your brothers, all the descendants of Ephraim.
24Jr 7:16 "As for you, don't pray on behalf of this people, don't cry or offer a petition for them, and don't plead with me, for I won't listen to you.
24Jr 7:17 Don't you see what they're doing in the cities of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem - 
24Jr 7:18 The children gather wood, the fathers kindle the fire, and the women knead dough to make cakes for the Queen of Heaven, and they pour out liquid offerings to other gods in order to provoke me.
24Jr 7:19 Are they provoking me? asks the Lord. "Is it not themselves, and to their own shame?
24Jr 7:20 Therefore, this is what the Lord God says£º "I'm about to pour out my anger and my wrath on this place, on people and animals, on the trees of the field, and on the fruit of the ground. It will burn, and it won't be put out."
24Jr 7:21 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "Add your burnt offerings to your sacrifices and eat the meat.
24Jr 7:22 Indeed, when I brought your ancestors out of the land of Egypt, I didn't speak or command them about burnt offering and sacrifice,
24Jr 7:23 but I did give them this command£º Obey me and I'll be your God, and you will be my people. Walk in all the ways that I command you so it will go well for you.
24Jr 7:24 But they didn't listen, nor did they pay attention. They pursued their own plans, stubbornly following their own evil desires. They went backward and not forward.
24Jr 7:25 From the day your ancestors left the land of Egypt to this present time, I've sent all my servants, the prophets, to you, again and again.
24Jr 7:26 But they didn't listen to me, and they didn't pay attention. They stiffened their necks, and they did more evil than their ancestors.
24Jr 7:27 "You will tell them all these things, but they won't listen to you. You will call out to them, but they won't answer you.
24Jr 7:28 You will say to them, 'This is the nation that wouldn't listen to the voice of the Lord its God and wouldn't accept correction. Truth has perished; it has been eliminated from their discussions.
24Jr 7:29 "Cut off your hair and throw it away; let your lamentations rise on the barren heights, because the Lord has rejected and abandoned the generation that is subject to his wrath.
24Jr 7:30 "For the people of Judah have done evil in my eyes," declares the Lord. "They have put their detestable idols in the house that is called by my name in order to defile it.
24Jr 7:31 They have built high places at Topheth in the Valley of Ben-Hinnom to burn their sons and daughters in the fire. I didn't command this, and it never entered my mind!
24Jr 7:32 "Therefore, the time is near," declares the Lord, "when it will no longer be called Topheth or the Valley of Ben-Hinnom, but the Valley of Slaughter. They'll bury in Topheth because there is no other place to do it.
24Jr 7:33 The dead bodies of these people will be food for the birds of the sky and for the animals of the land, and no one will disturb them.
24Jr 7:34 In the towns of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem I'll bring an end to the sound of gladness and rejoicing, to the sounds of the bridegroom and bride, for the land will become a wasteland."
24Jr 8:1 "At that time," declares the Lord, "the bones of the king of Judah, the bones of his officials, the bones of the priests, the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the residents of Jerusalem will be removed from their graves.
24Jr 8:2 They'll be spread out to the sun, the moon, and all the stars of the heavens, which they loved and served, and which they followed, consulted, and worshiped. Their bones won't be collected, nor will they be buried. They'll be like dung on the surface of the ground.
24Jr 8:3 "In all the places where the people remain, where I've banished them, death will be chosen over life by all the remnant that remains of this evil family," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
24Jr 8:4 "You are to say to them, 'This is what the Lord says£º Will a person fall down and then not get up?Will someone turn away and then not turn back again - 
24Jr 8:5 Why has this people turned away?Why does Jerusalem continue in apostasy?They hold on to deceit and refuse to repent.
24Jr 8:6 I've listened and I've heard, and what they say is not right. No one repents of his evil and says, 'What have I done? They all turn to their own course like a horse racing into battle.
24Jr 8:7 Even the stork in the sky knows its seasons, and the dove, the swallow, and the crane observe the time for migration. But my people don't know the requirements of the Lord.
24Jr 8:8 How can you say, 'We're wise, and the Law of the Lord is with us,' when, in fact, the deceitful pen of the scribe has made it into something that deceives.
24Jr 8:9 The wise men will be put to shame. They'll be dismayed and taken captive. Look, they have rejected the word of the Lord! So what kind of wisdom do they have - 
24Jr 8:10 Therefore, I'll give their wives to others, and their fields to new owners. Indeed, from the least important to the most important, they're all greedy for dishonest gain. From prophet to priest, they all act deceitfully.
24Jr 8:11 They have treated my people's wound superficially, telling them, 'Peace, peace, when there is no peace.'
24Jr 8:12 Are they ashamed because they have done what is repugnant to God?They weren't ashamed at all; they don't even know how to blush! Therefore they'll fall with those who fall. When I punish them, they'll be brought down," says the Lord.
24Jr 8:13 "I would have gathered them," declares the Lord, "but there were no grapes on the vine, and no figs on the fig tree, and their leaves were withered. What I've given them has been taken away."'"
24Jr 8:14 Why are we sitting here?Join together! Let's go to the fortified cities and perish there! For the Lord our God has condemned us to perish and given us poisoned water to drink, because we have sinned against him.
24Jr 8:15 We waited for peace, but no good has come, for a time of healing, but instead there was terror.
24Jr 8:16 "The snorting of their horses is heard from Dan. At the neighing of their stallions, the whole earth quakes. They're coming to devour the land and all it contains, the city and all who live in it.
24Jr 8:17 Look, I'll send snakes among you, vipers that cannot be charmed, and they'll bite you,"
24Jr 8:18 Incurable sorrow has overwhelmed me, my heart is sick within me.
24Jr 8:19 Listen, my people's cry from a distant land. 'Is the Lord no longer in Zion?Is her king no longer there? "Why did they provoke me to anger with their images, with their worthless foreign gods?
24Jr 8:20 The harvest is past, the summer has ended, and we haven't been delivered.
24Jr 8:21 Because my people are crushed, I'm crushed. I mourn, and dismay overwhelms me.
24Jr 8:22 Is there no balm in Gilead?Is there no physician there?So why is there no healing for my people - 
24Jr 9:1 "Oh, that my head were a spring of water, and my eyes a fountain of tears, for then I would cry day and night for those of my people who have been killed.
24Jr 9:2 Oh, that I had a lodging place for travelers in the desert, so that I could leave my people and go away from them. For all of them are adulterers, a band of traitors.
24Jr 9:3 They use their tongues like a bow. Lies rather than truth fly throughout the land. They progress from one evil to another, and they don't know me," declares the Lord.
24Jr 9:4 "Beware of your neighbors, and don't trust any of your relatives. For all of your relatives act deceitfully, and every friend goes around as a slanderer.
24Jr 9:5 People deceive their friends, and they don't tell the truth. They have taught their tongues to tell lies. They exhaust themselves practicing evil.
24Jr 9:6 You yourself live in the midst of deception, and because they are deceived they do not know me," declares the Lord.
24Jr 9:7 Therefore, this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Look, I'm about to refine and test them. Because they're my people, what else can I do - 
24Jr 9:8 Their tongue is a deadly arrow that speaks deceit. With his mouth a person says, 'Peace,' to his friend, but inwardly he sets a trap for him.
24Jr 9:9 Should I not punish them for these things - ," asks the Lord, "and should I not avenge myself on a nation like this?
24Jr 9:10 I'll weep and mourn for the mountains, and lament for the desert pastures, because they are desolate and no one passes through them. They don't hear the lowing of the cattle. Both the birds of the sky and the animals have fled. They're gone!
24Jr 9:11 "I'll make Jerusalem a heap of ruins, a refuge for jackals. I'll make the towns of Judah desolate, without inhabitants."
24Jr 9:12 Who is the wise person who understands this, and to whom has the Lord spoken so that he may declare it?Why is the land destroyed, ruined like the desert, without anyone passing through it - 
24Jr 9:13 The Lord said, "It is because they have forsaken my Law that I gave them. They didn't obey me and didn't live according to it.
24Jr 9:14 Instead, they followed their rebellious hearts and the Baals, as their ancestors taught them."
24Jr 9:15 Therefore, this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "Look, I'll make these people eat wormwood and drink poisoned water.
24Jr 9:16 I'll scatter them among nations that neither they nor their ancestors have known, and I'll pursue them with the sword until I've finished them off."
24Jr 9:17 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Think about what I'm saying! Indeed, call out the professional mourners! Send for the best of them to come.
24Jr 9:18 Let them hurry and lament for us. Let tears run down from our eyes, and let our eyelids flow with water.
24Jr 9:19 For a sound of mourning is heard from Zion£º 'How we're ruined! Our shame is very great, because we have left the land, because our houses are torn down.'"
24Jr 9:20 "Now, you women, hear the word of the Lord; listen to what he has to say! Teach your daughters how to mourn, let every woman teach her friend how to lament.
24Jr 9:21 For death comes up through our windows; it has come into our palaces to eliminate children from the streets and young men from the town squares.
24Jr 9:22 Speak! 'This is what the Lord says£º "The corpses of people will fall like dung on the surface of the field, and like a row of cut grain behind the harvester when there is no one to gather it."'"
24Jr 9:23 This is what the Lord says£º "The wise man is not to boast in his wisdom; the strong man is not to boast in his strength; and the rich man is not to boast in his riches.
24Jr 9:24 Rather, let the one who boasts, boast in this£º that he understands and knows me, for I am the Lord who acts with gracious love, justice, and righteousness in the land. I delight in these things," declares the Lord.9
24Jr 9:25 "Look, days are coming," declares the Lord, "when I'll punish all who are circumcised only in the flesh:
24Jr 9:26 Egypt, Judah, Edom, the people of Ammon, Moab, all those who live in the desert and shave the corners of their beard; indeed all the other nations that are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel that is uncircumcised of heart."
24Jr 10:1 Hear the word that the Lord has spoken to you, house of Israel.
24Jr 10:2 This is what the Lord says£º "Don't learn the way of the nations, and don't be terrified by signs in the heavens, though the nations are terrified of them.
24Jr 10:3 For the practices of the people are worthless. Indeed, a tree is cut down from the forest; it's the work of the hands of a craftsman with an ax.
24Jr 10:4 They decorate it with silver and gold. They secure it with nails and hammers so it won't totter.
24Jr 10:5 Their idols are like scarecrows in a cucumber field. They can't speak! They must always be carried because they can't walk! Don't be afraid of them because they can do no harm, nor can they do any good."
24Jr 10:6 There is no one like you, Lord. You are great, and your name is great and powerful.
24Jr 10:7 Who wouldn't fear you, king of the nations?This is what you deserve! Indeed, among all the wise men of the nations, and throughout all their kingdoms, there is no one like you!
24Jr 10:8 Everyone is stupid and senseless. They follow worthless instruction from a piece of wood!
24Jr 10:9 Beaten silver is brought from Tarshish, and gold from Uphaz. The idols are the work of a craftsman and of the hands of a goldsmith. Their clothing is violet and purple. The idols are all the work of skilled craftsmen.
24Jr 10:10 The Lord is the true God; he's the living God and the everlasting king. At his wrath the earth quakes, and the nations cannot endure his indignation.
24Jr 10:11 Tell this to them£º "The gods who didn't make the heavens and the earth will perish from the earth and from these heavens."
24Jr 10:12 The Lord is the one who made the world by his power, who established the earth by his wisdom and stretched out the heavens by his understanding.
24Jr 10:13 When his voice sounds there is thunder from the waters of heaven, and he makes clouds rise up from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings wind out of his storehouses.
24Jr 10:14 Everyone is stupid and without knowledge. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his idols, for his images are false. There is no life in them.
24Jr 10:15 They're worthless, a work of mockery, and when the time of punishment comes, they'll perish.
24Jr 10:16 The Portion of Jacob is not like these. He made everything, and Israel is the tribe of his inheritance. The Lord of the Heavenly Armies is his name.
24Jr 10:17 You who live under siege, Gather up your bundle from the ground.
24Jr 10:18 For this is what the Lord says£º "I'm going to throw out the inhabitants of the land at this time, and I'll bring distress on them so they'll experience it."
24Jr 10:19 Woe is me because of my injury. My wound is severe. I said, "Truly this is my sickness, and I must bear it.
24Jr 10:20 My tent is destroyed, and all my tent cords are broken. My sons have gone away from me, they no longer live. There is no one to pitch my tent again and set up my curtains.
24Jr 10:21 Because the shepherds are stupid and don't seek the Lord, therefore, they don't prosper, and their flock is scattered.
24Jr 10:22 The sound of a report, it's coming now! There is a great commotion from a land in the north to make the towns of Judah desolate, a refuge for jackals."
24Jr 10:23 Lord, I know that a person's life is not his to control, nor does a person establish his way in life.
24Jr 10:24 Lord, correct me, but with justice, not with anger. Otherwise, you'll bring me to nothing.
24Jr 10:25 Pour out your anger on the nations that don't acknowledge you, and on the families that don't call on your name. For they have devoured Jacob; they have devoured and consumed him; they have devastated his habitation.
24Jr 11:1 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord£º 
24Jr 11:2 "Listen to the words of this covenant, and convey them to the people of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
24Jr 11:3 You are to say to them, 'This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º "Cursed is the person who does not listen to the words of this covenant
24Jr 11:4 which I commanded to your ancestors on the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt, from the iron furnace. I said, 'Obey me and do everything that I commanded you. Then you will be my people and I'll be your God.'
24Jr 11:5 As a result, I'll fulfill the oath that I made with your ancestors to give them a land flowing with milk and honey, just as is the case today."'" Then I answered, "So be it, Lord."
24Jr 11:6 The Lord said to me, "Proclaim all these words in the towns of Judah and in the streets of Jerusalem. You are to say, 'Listen to the words of this covenant and do them.
24Jr 11:7 For I've diligently warned your ancestors from the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt until now, regularly warning them, saying, "Obey me!"
24Jr 11:8 But they would not listen or turn their ear, and each of them stubbornly followed his own evil desires. So I brought on them all the consequences of this covenant that I commanded them to fulfill, but they did not.'"
24Jr 11:9 The Lord said to me, "Conspiracy has been found among the people of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem.
24Jr 11:10 They have turned back to the iniquities of their ancestors of old who refused to listen to my words. They followed other gods to serve them. The house of Israel and the house of Judah broke my covenant which I made with their ancestors."
24Jr 11:11 Therefore, this is what the Lord says£º "I'm about to bring disaster on them from which they won't be able to escape. They'll cry out to me, but I won't listen to them.
24Jr 11:12 The towns of Judah and the residents of Jerusalem will go and cry out to the gods to whom they burn incense, but they'll be no help at all to them in the time of their disaster.
24Jr 11:13 Judah, you have as many gods as you have towns, and you have set up as many altars to the shameful idols as there are streets in Jerusalem. You burn incense to Baal on these altars.
24Jr 11:14 "Jeremiah, don't pray for this people and don't cry or pray for them. I won't listen when they cry out to me because of their disaster.
24Jr 11:15 "What right does my beloved have in my house, when she has carried out many evil schemes?Can sacrificial flesh turn disaster away from you, so you can rejoice?
24Jr 11:16 The Lord once called you a green olive tree, with beautiful shape and fruit. With a great roaring sound, he has set fire to it and its branches will be destroyed.
24Jr 11:17 The Lord of the Heavenly Armies who planted you has called for disaster on you because of the evil of the house of Israel and the house of Judah, has provoked me by burning incense to Baal."
24Jr 11:18 The Lord made it known to me, and so I understood. Then you showed me their malicious deeds.
24Jr 11:19 I was like a gentle lamb led to the slaughter. I didn't know that they had devised schemes against me. They said to themselves, "Let's destroy the tree with its fruit. Let's eliminate him from the land of the living, so his name won't be remembered again."
24Jr 11:20 Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the righteous judge, the one who tests feelings and the heart, let me see your vengeance on them, for I've committed my cause to you.
24Jr 11:21 Therefore, this is what the Lord says about the men of Anathoth who seek to kill you, all the while threatening you, "Don't prophesy in the name of the Lord so you won't die by our hand!"
24Jr 11:22 Therefore, this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "I'm about to punish them. The young men will die by the sword. Their sons and daughters will die by famine.
24Jr 11:23 Not one of them will be left, for I'll bring disaster on the men of Anathoth when I punish them."11
24Jr 12:1 You are righteous, Lord, even when I bring a complaint to you. But I want to discuss justice with you. Why does the way of the wicked prosper, while all who are treacherous are at ease - 
24Jr 12:2 You plant them and they take root, they grow and bear fruit. "You are near to us," they say with their mouths, but the truth is that you're far from their hearts.
24Jr 12:3 You know me, Lord. You see me and test my thoughts toward you. Pull the wicked out like sheep for slaughter; set them apart for the day of butchering.
24Jr 12:4 How long will the land mourn and the vegetation of every field dry up?Because of the wickedness of those who live in it, animals and birds are swept away. For they say, "He does not see our future."
24Jr 12:5 Indeed, if you run with others on foot, and they tire you out, how can you compete with horses?You are secure in a land at peace, but how will you do in the thicket of the Jordan - 
24Jr 12:6 Indeed, even your brothers and your father's family conspire against you. Even they cry out after you loudly. Don't believe them, even though they speak friendly words to you.
24Jr 12:7 I'll forsake my house, I'll abandon my inheritance. I'll give the beloved of my heart into the hand of her enemies.
24Jr 12:8 My inheritance has become like a lion in the forest to me. She roars at me; therefore, I hate her.
24Jr 12:9 Is my inheritance like a speckled bird of prey to me?Are the other birds of prey all around her coming against her?Go, gather all the wild animals and bring them to devour it.
24Jr 12:10 Many shepherds will destroy my vineyard. They'll trample down my portion. They'll turn my pleasant portion into a desolate desert.
24Jr 12:11 They'll make it into a desolate place, and, desolate, it will cry out in mourning to me. The whole land will be desolate because no one takes it to heart.
24Jr 12:12 On all the barren heights in the desert destroyers will come. Indeed, a sword of the Lord will devour from one end of the land to the other. There will be no peace for any person.
24Jr 12:13 They have sown wheat, but they have harvested thorns. They have tired themselves out, but they don't show a profit. Now be disappointed about your harvest because of the fierce anger of the Lord.
24Jr 12:14 This is what the Lord says about all the wicked neighbors who strike out against the land I've given to my people Israel as their inheritance. "I'm about to uproot them from their land, and I'll uproot the house of Judah from among them.
24Jr 12:15 After I've uprooted them I'll again have compassion on them. I'll return each one of them to his inheritance, and each one to his own land.
24Jr 12:16 If they have learned the ways of my people well, to swear by my name£º 'As surely as the Lord lives,' just as they once taught my people to swear by Baal, then they'll be built up among my people.
24Jr 12:17 But if they don't listen, then I'll completely uproot that nation and destroy it," declares the Lord.1216
24Jr 13:1 This is what the Lord said to me£º "Go and buy a linen belt for yourself, and put it around your waist. But don't let it get wet."
24Jr 13:2 So I bought the belt according to the Lord's instruction, and put it around my waist.
24Jr 13:3 Then the word of the Lord came to me a second time£º 
24Jr 13:4 Take the belt that you bought and that is around your waist. Get up and go to the Euphrates, and hide it there in a crevice in the rock."
24Jr 13:5 So I went and hid it at the Euphrates, just as the Lord had commanded me.
24Jr 13:6 After a long time, the Lord said to me, "Arise, go to the Euphrates, and get the belt that I commanded you to hide there."
24Jr 13:7 I went to the Euphrates and dug it up. I got the belt from the place where I had hidden it. The belt was ruined! It was not good for anything.
24Jr 13:8 Then the word of the Lord came to me£º 
24Jr 13:9 "This is what the Lord says£º 'In the same way I'll ruin the pride of Judah and the pride of Jerusalem.
24Jr 13:10 This evil people that refuses to listen to my words, that stubbornly pursues their own desires, and that follows other gods to serve and worship them, will be like this belt that is not good for anything.
24Jr 13:11 For just as the belt clings tightly to a person's waist, so I've made all the people of Israel and all the people of Judah cling tightly to me,' declares the Lord. 'I did this so that they would be my people, name, praise, and glory. But they wouldn't listen.'
24Jr 13:12 "This is what you're to tell them£º 'This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º "Every wineskin is to be filled with wine."' When they say to you, 'Don't we know very well that every wineskin is to be filled with wine?,
24Jr 13:13 then say to them, 'This is what the Lord says£º "I'm about to make all the inhabitants of this land drunk - the kings who sit on David's throne, the priests, the prophets, and all the residents of Jerusalem.
24Jr 13:14 I'll smash them against each other, even fathers against their sons," declares the Lord. "I'll have no pity, mercy, or compassion when I destroy them."'"
24Jr 13:15 Listen and pay attention! Don't be proud, for the Lord has spoken.
24Jr 13:16 Give glory to the Lord your God before he brings darkness, before your feet stumble on the mountains at twilight. You hope for light, but he turns it into deep darkness. He changes it into heavy gloom.
24Jr 13:17 If you don't listen, I'll cry secretly because of your pride. My eyes will cry bitterly, flowing tears, because the Lord's flock has been taken captive.
24Jr 13:18 Say to the king and the queen mother, "Come take a lowly seat, because your beautiful crowns have fallen off your heads."
24Jr 13:19 The towns in the Negev will be closed up, and there will be no one to open them. All Judah will be taken into exile and be completely exiled.
24Jr 13:20 "Look up and see those who are coming from the north. Where is the flock that was given to you?your beautiful sheep - 
24Jr 13:21 What will you say when the Lord appoints over you as your head those whom you taught to be your allies?Pain will seize you like that seizing a woman about to give birth, will it not - 
24Jr 13:22 When you say to yourselves, 'Why have all these things happened to me? It's because of the extent of your iniquity that your skirt has been lifted up, and your heels have suffered violence.
24Jr 13:23 Can an Ethiopian change his skin, or a leopard his spots?Then you who are trained to do evil will also be able to do good.
24Jr 13:24 I'll scatter them like chaff blown away by a desert wind.
24Jr 13:25 "This is your fate, the portion I've measured out for you," declares the Lord, "because you have forgotten me and have trusted in false gods.
24Jr 13:26 I'll also pull your skirt up over your face, so your shame will be seen,
24Jr 13:27 I've seen your detestable behavior£º your adulteries, your passionate neighing, your lewd immorality on the hills in the field. How terrible it will be for you, Jerusalem! You are unclean. How much longer will this go on?
24Jr 14:1 This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah concerning the drought£º 
24Jr 14:2 "Judah mourns, and her gates languish. The people mourn for the land, and the cry of Jerusalem goes up.
24Jr 14:3 Their nobles send their young people for water. They go to the cisterns, but they find no water. They return with their vessels empty. They're disappointed and dismayed, and they cover their heads in shame.
24Jr 14:4 The ground is cracked, because there has been no rain in the land. The farmers are disappointed, and they cover their heads in shame.
24Jr 14:5 Even the doe in the field gives birth and then abandons her young because there is no grass.
24Jr 14:6 Wild donkeys stand on the barren hills. They pant for air like jackals. Their eyesight fails because there is no vegetation."
24Jr 14:7 Lord,eventhoughouriniquitiestestifyagainstus, do something for the sake of your name. Indeed, our apostasies are many, and we have sinned against you.
24Jr 14:8 Hope of Israel, its deliverer in time of trouble, why are you like a stranger in the land, like a traveler who sets up his tent for a night - 
24Jr 14:9 Why are you like a man taken by surprise, like a strong man who can't deliver?You are among us, Lord, and your name is the one by which we're called. Don't abandon us!
24Jr 14:10 This is what the Lord says to these people£º "Yes, they do love to wander, and they haven't restrained their feet. So the Lord won't accept them now. He will remember their iniquity and punish their sin."
24Jr 14:11 Then the Lord said to me, "Don't pray for the welfare of these people.
24Jr 14:12 Although they fast, I won't listen to their cry, and although they offer burnt offerings and grain offerings, I won't accept them. Instead, I'll put an end to them with the sword, with famine, and with a plague."
24Jr 14:13 Then I said, "Ah, Lord GOD, look! The prophets are saying to them, 'You won't see the sword and you won't experience famine. Rather, I'll give you lasting peace in this place.'"
24Jr 14:14 Then the Lord told me, "The prophets are prophesying lies in my name. I didn't send them, I didn't command them, and I didn't speak to them. They're proclaiming to you false visions, worthless predictions, and the delusions of their own minds.
24Jr 14:15 Therefore, this is what the Lord says about the false prophets who prophesy in my name, 'There will be no sword and famine in this land' (though I haven't sent them)£º 'By the sword and by famine these prophets will be finished off!
24Jr 14:16 The people to whom they have prophesied will be thrown out into the streets of Jerusalem because of the famine and the sword. There will be no one to bury them, their wives, their sons, or their daughters. I'll pour out on them the judgment they deserve.'"
24Jr 14:17 "And deliver this message to them£º 'Let tears run down my face, night and day, and don't let them stop, because my virgin daughter - my people?will be broken with a powerful blow, with a severe wound.
24Jr 14:18 If I go out into the field, I see those slain by the sword! If I go into the city, I see the ravages of the famine! Indeed, both prophet and priest ply their trade in the land, but they don't know anything.'"
24Jr 14:19 Have you completely rejected Judah?Do you despise Zion?Why have you struck us, so that there is no healing for us?We hoped for peace, but no good came, for a time of healing, but there was only terror.
24Jr 14:20 We acknowledge, Lord, our wickedness, the guilt of our ancestors. Indeed, we have sinned against you.
24Jr 14:21 For the sake of your name don't despise us. Don't dishonor your glorious throne. Remember, don't break your covenant with us!
24Jr 14:22 Can any of the worthless gods of the nations make it rain?Can the heavens themselves bring forth showers?Aren't you the one who does this, Lord our God?So we hope in you, for you are the one who does all these things.
24Jr 15:1 Then the Lord said to me, "Even if Moses and Samuel were standing before me, I wouldn't be favorably disposed toward this people. Send them out of my presence! Let them go!
24Jr 15:2 "When they say to you, 'Where can we go?, say to them, 'This is what the Lord says£º "Those destined for death, to death will go; those destined for the sword, to the sword will go; and those destined for captivity, to captivity will go.
24Jr 15:3 "I'll appoint four kinds of judgment for them," declares the Lord£º "the sword to kill, the dogs to drag off, the birds of the sky to devour, and the animals of the land to destroy.
24Jr 15:4 I'll make them a horrifying sight to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Hezekiah's son Manasseh, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem.
24Jr 15:5 "Who will have pity on you, Jerusalem, and who will grieve for you?Who will go out of his way to ask about your welfare - 
24Jr 15:6 You have deserted me," declares the Lord. "You keep going backward. I'll reach out my hand and destroy you. I'm tired of showing compassion.
24Jr 15:7 I'll winnow them with a winnowing fork in the gates of the land. I'll make them childless. I'll destroy my people, for they didn't change their ways.
24Jr 15:8 I'll make their widows more numerous than the sand of the sea. At noontime I'll send a destroyer against the mother of a young man. I'll cause terror and anguish to come to her unexpectedly.
24Jr 15:9 "The woman who gave birth to seven will grow faint, her life will expire. Her sun will set while it's still day. She will be disgraced and humiliated. I'll kill the rest of them with swords in the presence of their enemies," declares the Lord.
24Jr 15:10 How terrible for me, my mother, that you gave birth to me, a man of strife and contention for the whole land! I've neither lent nor borrowed, yet everyone curses me.
24Jr 15:11 The Lord said, "Have I not set you free for a good purpose?Have I not intervened for you with your enemies in times of trouble and times of distress - 
24Jr 15:12 "Can anyone break iron?iron from the north - or bronze - 
24Jr 15:13 "I'll give away your wealth and your treasures as plunder, for free, because of all your sins throughout your territory.
24Jr 15:14 I'll make you serve your enemies in a land you don't know, for my anger has started a fire that will burn against you."
24Jr 15:15 You are aware?Lord, remember me, pay attention to me, and vindicate me in front of those who pursue me. You are patient?don't take me away. Know that I suffer insult because of you!
24Jr 15:16 Your words were found, and I consumed them. Your words were joy and my hearts delight, because I bear your name, Lord God of the Heavenly Armies.
24Jr 15:17 I didn't sit in the company of those who have fun, and I didn't rejoice. Because of your hand on me, I sat alone, for you filled me with indignation.
24Jr 15:18 Why is my pain unending and my wound incurable, refusing to be healed?You are like a deceptive brook, whose waters cannot be depended on.
24Jr 15:19 Therefore, this is what the Lord says£º "If you repent, I'll take you back and you will stand before me. If you speak what is worthwhile, instead of what is worthless, then you will be my spokesman. People will turn to you, but you aren't to turn to them.
24Jr 15:20 I'll make you a fortified wall of bronze to this people. They'll fight against you, but they won't prevail against you, for I am with you to save you and deliver you,"
24Jr 15:21 So I'll deliver you from the hand of the wicked, and redeem you from the grasp of the ruthless."
24Jr 16:1 The word of the Lord came to me£º 
24Jr 16:2 "You are not to take a wife, nor shall you have sons or daughters in this place."
24Jr 16:3 For this is what the Lord says about the sons and daughters who are born in this place, about their mothers who give birth to them, and about their fathers who father them in this land£º 
24Jr 16:4 "They'll die of deadly diseases. People won't mourn for them, nor will they be buried. They'll be dung on the surface of the ground, and they'll come to an end with the sword and with famine. Their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the animals of the land."
24Jr 16:5 For this is what the Lord says£º "Don't go to a house where there is mourning, don't go to lament, nor to express sorrow to them. For I've taken my peace away from this people," declares the Lord, "as well as gracious love and compassion.
24Jr 16:6 Both the most and the least important people will die in this land, and they won't be buried. People won't mourn for them. They won't cut themselves, nor will they shave their heads for them.
24Jr 16:7 They won't break bread for the mourner to be consoled for the dead. They won't give anyone the cup of consolation to drink for his father or mother.
24Jr 16:8 Don't go to a banquet to sit with people to eat and drink."
24Jr 16:9 For this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "In this place I'm about to bring an end to the sounds of happiness and rejoicing, the sounds of the bridegroom and the bride. I'll do it in front of your eyes and in your time.5
24Jr 16:10 "When you speak all these words to this people, they'll say to you, 'Why has the Lord pronounced all this disaster against us?What is our iniquity, and what is the sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?
24Jr 16:11 Then say to them, 'It is because your ancestors abandoned me,' declares the Lord. 'They followed other gods, served them, worshipped them, abandoned me, and didn't keep my Law.
24Jr 16:12 You have done even more evil than your ancestors, and each one of you is stubbornly following his own evil desires, refusing to listen to me.
24Jr 16:13 I'll throw you out of this land into a land neither you nor your ancestors have known. There you will serve other gods day and night, and I'll show you no favor.'
24Jr 16:14 "Therefore, days are coming," declares the Lord, "when it will no longer be said, 'As surely as the Lord lives, who brought up the Israelites from the land of Egypt.'
24Jr 16:15 Rather it will be said, 'As surely as the Lord lives, who brought the Israelites up from the land of the north and from all the lands to which the Lord had banished them.' I'll bring them back to their land, which I gave to their ancestors.
24Jr 16:16 "I'm about to send many fishermen, declares the Lord, and they'll catch them. Afterwards, I'll send for many hunters and they'll hunt for them on every mountain and hill and in the crevices of the rocks.
24Jr 16:17 For I am watching all their ways; they are not hidden from my sight. Their iniquity is not concealed from my eyes.
24Jr 16:18 First I'll repay them double for their iniquity and their sin, because they have polluted my land with the dead bodies of their detestable images, and they have filled my inheritance with their abominations."
24Jr 16:19 Lord, my strength and my stronghold, my refuge in a time of difficulty, to you the nations will come, and from the ends of the earth they'll say, "Surely our ancestors inherited deception, things that are worthless, and in which there is no profit."
24Jr 16:20 Can a person make a god for himself?They are not gods!
24Jr 16:21 Therefore, I'm about to make them understand; this time I'll make them understand my power and strength, so they'll understand that my name is the Lord.
24Jr 17:1 The sin of Judah is engraved with an iron stylus. It is inscribed with a diamond point on the tablet of their heart and on the horns of their altars.
24Jr 17:2 When their sons remember, they remember their altars and their Asherah poles beside green trees on the high hills.
24Jr 17:3 My mountain in the field, your wealth and your treasures I'll give as spoil; along with your high places as the price of your sin throughout your territory.
24Jr 17:4 You will let go of your inheritance which I gave you, and I'll make you serve your enemies in a land that you don't know. For with my anger you have started a fire that will burn forever.
24Jr 17:5 This is what the Lord says£º "Cursed is the person who trusts in mankind, who makes flesh his strength, and whose heart turns away from the Lord.
24Jr 17:6 He will be like a bush in the desert, and he won't see when good comes. He will dwell in parched places in the wilderness, a land of salt, without inhabitants.
24Jr 17:7 Blessed is the person who trusts in the Lord, making the Lord his trust.
24Jr 17:8 He will be like a tree planted by the water that sends out its roots by a stream. He won't fear when the heat comes, and his leaves will be green. In a year of drought he won't be concerned, nor will he stop producing fruit."
24Jr 17:9 "The heart is more deceitful than anything. It is incurable?who can know it - 
24Jr 17:10 I am the Lord who searches the heart, who tests the inner depths to give to each person according to what he deserves, according to the fruit of his deeds.
24Jr 17:11 As a partridge gathers together eggs that it didn't lay, so is a person who amasses wealth unjustly. In the middle of his life it will leave him, and in the end he will prove to be a fool.
24Jr 17:12 A glorious throne exalted from the beginning is the place of our sanctuary.
24Jr 17:13 Lord, you are the hope of Israel; all who forsake you will be put to shame. Those who turn aside from you will be written in the dust, because they have forsaken the Lord, the spring of living water.
24Jr 17:14 Heal me, Lord, and I'll be healed; deliver me, and I'll be delivered, because you are my praise.
24Jr 17:15 Look, they're saying to me, "Where is the word of the Lord?Let it come about!"
24Jr 17:16 I haven't run away from being your shepherd, and I haven't longed for the day of sickness. You know what comes out from my lips, it's open before you.
24Jr 17:17 Don't be a terror to me. You are my refuge in a day of trouble.
24Jr 17:18 Let those who pursue me be put to shame, but don't put me to shame. Let them be terrified, but don't let me be terrified. Bring the day of judgment on them, and destroy them with double destruction!
24Jr 17:19 The Lord said to me, "Go, stand in the gate of the people, where the kings of Judah come in and go out, and in the other gates of Jerusalem as well.
24Jr 17:20 Say to them, 'Kings of Judah, all Judah, and all the residents of Jerusalem entering these gates, hear the word of the Lord.
24Jr 17:21 This is what the Lord says£º "Be careful! On the Sabbath day, don't carry any load or bring anything through the gates of Jerusalem.
24Jr 17:22 Don't bring any load out of your houses on the Sabbath day, nor are you to do any work. You are to consecrate the Sabbath day, just as I commanded your ancestors.
24Jr 17:23 But they didn't listen, nor did they pay attention. They were determined not to listen and not to accept instruction.
24Jr 17:24 If you listen to me carefully," declares the Lord, "and don't bring a load through the gates of this city on the Sabbath day, and you consecrate the Sabbath day and don't do any work on it,
24Jr 17:25 then kings and princes, sitting on the throne of David will come through the gates of this city. They, their princes, the men of Judah, and the residents of Jerusalem will come riding in chariots and on horses, and this city will be inhabited forever.
24Jr 17:26 They'll come from the cities of Judah, from the places around Jerusalem, from the territory of Benjamin, from the Shephelah, from the hill country, and from the Negev, bringing burnt offerings, sacrifices, grain offerings, and incense, and bringing thanksgiving offerings to the LORD's temple.
24Jr 17:27 But if you don't listen to me, to consecrate the Sabbath day and not carry any load as you enter the gates of Jerusalem on the Sabbath day, then I'll start a fire in its gates. It will consume the palaces of Jerusalem and won't be extinguished."'"
24Jr 18:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord£º 
24Jr 18:2 "Arise and go down to the potter's house, and there I'll allow you to hear my words."
24Jr 18:3 So I went down to the potter's house, and there he was doing work at the potter's wheel.
24Jr 18:4 But the vessel he was working on with the clay was ruined in the potter's hand. So he remade it into another vessel that seemed appropriate to him.
24Jr 18:5 Then the word of the Lord came to me£º 
24Jr 18:6 "Israel, can't I deal with you like this potter? declares the Lord. "Look, Israel, like clay in the potter's hand, so are you in my hand.
24Jr 18:7 At one moment I may speak about a nation or a kingdom to uproot it, pull it down, or destroy it.
24Jr 18:8 But if that nation about which I spoke turns from its evil way, I'll change my mind about the disaster that I had planned for it.
24Jr 18:9 At another moment I may speak about a nation or kingdom to build it or plant it.
24Jr 18:10 But if that nation does evil in my eyes by not obeying me, I'll change my mind about the good that I said I would bring on it.8
24Jr 18:11 "Now say to the people of Judah and to the residents of Jerusalem, 'This is what the Lord says£º "Look, I'm designing a disaster just for you, and I'm making plans against you. Each one of you must repent from his evil way. Make your ways and deeds right."'
24Jr 18:12 But they'll say, 'It's useless! We will follow our plans and each of us will pursue his own evil desires.'11
24Jr 18:13 "Therefore, this is what the Lord says£º 'Ask the nations. Who has ever heard of anything like this?You have done a most horrible thing, virgin Israel.
24Jr 18:14 Does the snow of Lebanon ever vanish from its rocky slopes?Or does the cold water from a foreign land ever cease to flow - 
24Jr 18:15 Yet my people have forgotten me, and they burn incense to worthless idols that make them stumble in their journey on the ancient paths. They walk on trails, on a way that is not built up.
24Jr 18:16 They make their land into a desolate place, an object of lasting scorn. All who pass by will be appalled and will shake their heads.
24Jr 18:17 'Like the east wind, I'll scatter them before the enemy. I'll show them my back and not my face, on the day of their downfall.'"
24Jr 18:18 Then they said, "Come, let's make up a plot against Jeremiah. After all, the priest's instruction, the wise man's counsel, and the prophet's word won't be destroyed. So let's verbally attack him. Pay no attention to anything he says!"18
24Jr 18:19 Lord, pay attention to me. Listen to the voice of my accusers!
24Jr 18:20 Should good be repaid with evil?Yet they have dug a pit to take my life. Remember! I stood before you and spoke good on their behalf in order to turn your wrath away from them.
24Jr 18:21 Therefore, make their children undergo famine, and deliver them over to death in time of war. May their women be childless widows! May their men be slaughtered! May their young men be slain by the sword in battle!
24Jr 18:22 Let a cry be heard from their houses because you have brought a raiding party against them suddenly. For they have dug a pit to capture me and have set traps for my feet.
24Jr 18:23 But you, Lord, know all their plots to kill me. Don't forgive their iniquity, and don't erase their sin from your sight. Let them stumble before you. When it's time for you to be angry, act against them!
24Jr 19:1 This is what the Lord says£º "Go and buy a potter's clay jug. Take along some of the elders of the people and some of the elders of the priests.
24Jr 19:2 Go out to the Valley of Hinnom at the entrance to the Potsherd Gate, and there proclaim the words that I'm telling you.
24Jr 19:3 "You are to say, 'Hear the word of the Lord, you kings of Judah and residents of Jerusalem! "'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "I'm about to bring a disaster on this place that will make the ears of all who hear about it tingle.
24Jr 19:4 For they have forsaken me and have treated this place as foreign. In it they have burned incense to other gods that neither they, their ancestors, nor the kings of Judah knew. They have also filled this place with the blood of innocent people.
24Jr 19:5 They built the high places for Baal to burn their children in the fire as a burnt offering to Baal - something I didn't command, didn't say, nor did it ever enter my mind!
24Jr 19:6 "Therefore, days are coming," declares the Lord, "when this place will no longer be called Topheth, or the Valley of Hinnom, but rather the Valley of Slaughter.
24Jr 19:7 I'll shatter the counsel of Judah and Jerusalem in this place, and I'll make them fall by the sword before their enemies and at the hands of those seeking their lives. I'll give their dead bodies as food to the birds of the sky and to the animals of the land.
24Jr 19:8 I'll make this city into a desolate place and an object of scorn. All who pass by it will be astonished and will scoff because of all its wounds.
24Jr 19:9 I'll cause them to eat the flesh of their sons and daughters, and people will eat the flesh of their neighbors in the siege and in the distress to which their enemies and those seeking their lives will subject them.
24Jr 19:10 Then you are to break the jug in front of the men who have come with you,
24Jr 19:11 and say to them, 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "In this same way I'll break this people and this city, just as someone breaks a potter's vessel which he then cannot put back together again. They'll bury corpses in Topheth until there is no more room to bury anyone.
24Jr 19:12 This is what I'll do to this place and its residents," declares the Lord, "making this city like Topheth.
24Jr 19:13 The houses of Jerusalem and the houses of the kings of Judah will be polluted like Topheth, as will be all the houses on whose roofs people burned incense to all the host of heaven and poured out liquid offerings to other gods."'"
24Jr 19:14 Then Jeremiah went from Topheth where the Lord had sent him to prophesy. He stood in the courtyard of the LORD's temple, saying to all the people,
24Jr 19:15 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º 'I'm about to bring on this city and all its towns all the disaster that I declared against it because they were determined not to obey my word.'" 
24Jr 20:1 When the priest Pashur, Immer's son, who was the officer in charge of the Lord's temple heard Jeremiah prophesying these words,
24Jr 20:2 Pashur struck Jeremiah the prophet and put him in the stocks that were at the upper Benjamin Gate of the temple.
24Jr 20:3 The next day Pashur released Jeremiah from the stocks, and Jeremiah said to him, "The Lord has not named you Pashur, but rather Magor-missabib.
24Jr 20:4 For this is what the Lord says£º 'Look, I'm going to make you a terror to yourself and to all your loved ones. They'll fall by the sword of their enemies, and your eyes will see it. I'll give all Judah into the hand of the king of Babylon. He will take them into exile to Babylon, and he will execute them with swords.
24Jr 20:5 I'll turn over all the wealth of this city, all its possessions, all its valuables, and all the treasures of the kings of Judah right into the hands of their enemies, and they'll plunder them, capture them, and take them to Babylon.
24Jr 20:6 You, Pashur, and all those living in your house will go into captivity. You will go to Babylon and there you will die. There you and all your loved ones to whom you have falsely prophesied will be buried.'"
24Jr 20:7 You deceived me, Lord, and I've been deceived. You overpowered me, and you prevailed. I've become a laughing stock all day long, and everyone mocks me.
24Jr 20:8 Indeed, as often as I speak, I cry out, and shout, "Violence and destruction!" For the word of the Lord has caused me constant reproach and derision.
24Jr 20:9 When I say, "I won't remember the Lord, nor will I speak in his name any more, then there is this burning fire in my heart. It is bound up in my bones, I grow weary of trying to hold it in, and I cannot do it!
24Jr 20:10 Indeed, I hear many people whispering, "Terror on every side. Denounce him, let's denounce him!" All my close friends watch my steps and say, "Perhaps he will be deceived, and we can prevail against him and take vengeance on him."
24Jr 20:11 ButtheLord is with me like a fearsome warrior. Therefore, those who pursue me will stumble and won't prevail. They'll be put to great shame, when they don't succeed. Their everlasting disgrace won't be forgotten.
24Jr 20:12 Lord of the Heavenly Armies, who tests the righteous, who sees the inner motives and the heart, let me see you take vengeance on them, for I've committed my case to you.
24Jr 20:13 Sing to the Lord, give praise to the Lord! For he saves the life of the poor from the hand of the wicked.
24Jr 20:14 Let the day on which I was born be cursed. Don't let the day on which my mother gave birth to me be blessed.
24Jr 20:15 Cursed is the person who brought the good news to my father, "A baby boy has been born to you," making him very happy.
24Jr 20:16 May that man be like the cities that the Lord overthrew without compassion. Let him hear a cry in the morning, and a battle cry at noon,
24Jr 20:17 because he didn't kill me in the womb, so that my mother would have been my grave and her womb forever pregnant.
24Jr 20:18 Why did I ever come out of the womb to see trouble and sorrow, and to finish my life living in shame - 
24Jr 21:1 The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord when King Zedekiah sent to him Malchiah's son Pashur and Maaseiah's son Zephaniah the priest:
24Jr 21:2 Please inquire of the Lord on our behalf, for Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon is fighting against us. Perhaps the Lord will do some of his miraculous acts for us, and Nebuchadnezzar will depart from us."
24Jr 21:3 Jeremiah said to them, "This is what you are to say to Zedekiah,
24Jr 21:4 'This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º "I'm about to turn against you the weapons of war that are in your hands and with which you are fighting the king of Babylon and the Chaldeans who are besieging you outside the walls. I'll gather them into the center of this city.
24Jr 21:5 Because of my anger, wrath, and great fury, I'll fight against you myself with an outstretched hand and a strong arm.
24Jr 21:6 I'll strike down the residents of this city, both people and animals, and they'll die from a terrible plague.
24Jr 21:7 Afterwards," declares the Lord, "I'll give King Zedekiah of Judah, his officials, and the people - those who are left in this city from the plague, the sword, and the famine - into the control of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, right into the hand of their enemies and the hand of those who want to kill them. He'll execute them with swords and won't pity them. He won't spare them, nor will he have compassion on them."'
24Jr 21:8 "You are to say to this people, 'This is what the Lord says£º "I'm about to set before you the way of life and the way of death.
24Jr 21:9 Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, by famine, and by the plague. But whoever goes out and surrenders to the Chaldeans who are besieging you will live. He will save his life as a spoil of war.
24Jr 21:10 Indeed, I'm firmly decided?I'm sending calamity to this city, not good," declares the Lord. "It will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will set it on fire."'
24Jr 21:11 "To the house of the king of Judah say, 'Hear the word of the Lord.
24Jr 21:12 This is what the Lord says, house of David£º "Judge appropriately every morning, and deliver those who have been robbed from the oppressor, so my anger does not break out like fire and burn with no one to put it out because of your evil deeds.
24Jr 21:13 "Look, I'm against you, city dwelling in the valley, rock of the plain," declares the Lord, "those of you who say, 'Who can come down against us and who can enter our habitations?
24Jr 21:14 But I'll punish you according to what you have done," declares the Lord. "I'll start a fire in her forest, and it will consume everything around her."'"
24Jr 22:1 This is what the Lord says£º "Go down to the house of the king of Judah and tell him this£º 
24Jr 22:2 'Listen to the word of the Lord, king of Judah, you who sit on the throne of David - you, your officials, and your people who enter these gates.
24Jr 22:3 This is what the Lord says£º "Uphold justice and righteousness. Deliver from their oppressor those who have been robbed. Don't mistreat or do violence to the alien, the orphan, or the widow, or shed the blood of innocent people in this place.
24Jr 22:4 Rather, carefully obey this word, and then kings sitting for David on his throne and riding in chariots and on horses will enter the gates of this house. The king will enter along with his officials and his people.
24Jr 22:5 But if you don't listen to these words, I swear," declares the Lord, "that this house will become a ruin."'"
24Jr 22:6 For this is what the Lord says about the house of the king of Judah, "You are like Gilead to me, like the summit of Lebanon. Yet I'll surely make you a desert, towns where no one lives.
24Jr 22:7 I'll appoint people to destroy you, men with their weapons. They'll cut down some of your choice cedars and throw them into the fire.
24Jr 22:8 "Many nations will pass by this city and say to one another, 'Why did the Lord do this to this great city?
24Jr 22:9 Then people will respond, 'It is because they have forsaken the covenant of the Lord their God and have bowed down to other gods and served them.'
24Jr 22:10 "Don't cry for the dead or grieve for them. Weep bitterly for the one going away, because he won't return again nor see the land of his birth.
24Jr 22:11 "For this is what the Lord says about Josiah's son Shallum, king of Judah, who reigned in place of his father Josiah£º 'He went out from this place and won't return to it again.
24Jr 22:12 He will die in the place where they exiled him, and he won't ever see this land again.'"
24Jr 22:13 "How terrible for him who builds his house without righteousness, and its upper rooms without justice, who makes his neighbor work for nothing, and does not pay him his wage.
24Jr 22:14 "How terrible for him who says, 'I'll build a large house for myself with spacious upper rooms, who cuts out windows for it, paneling it with cedar and painting it red.'
24Jr 22:15 "Are you a king because you try to outdo everyone with cedar?Your father ate and drank and upheld justice and righteousness, did he not?And then it went well for him.
24Jr 22:16 He judged the case of the poor and needy. And then it went well for him. Isn't this what it means to know me - 
24Jr 22:17 But your eyes and heart are on nothing but your dishonest gain, shedding the blood of innocent people, and practicing oppression and extortion.
24Jr 22:18 Therefore, this is what the Lord says about Josiah's son Jehoiakim, king of Judah, "They won't lament for him with these words£º 'How terrible, my brother, How terrible, my sister!' They won't lament for him with these words£º 'How terrible, lord, How terrible, your majesty!'
24Jr 22:19 "He will receive a donkey's burial, dragged out and thrown outside the gates of Jerusalem."
24Jr 22:20 Go up to Lebanon and cry out, to Bashan and lift up your voice. Cry out from Abarim, for all your lovers have been crushed.
24Jr 22:21 I spoke to you when you were secure, but you said, "I won't listen!" This has been your way since your youth, for you haven't obeyed me.
24Jr 22:22 The wind will shepherd all your shepherds, and your lovers will go into exile. Indeed, you will then be ashamed and humiliated because of all your wickedness.
24Jr 22:23 You who live in Lebanon, who build your nest in the cedars, how you will groan when pains come upon you, pain like that of a woman giving birth.
24Jr 22:24 "As certainly as I'm alive and living," declares the Lord, "even if Jehoiakim's son King Jehoiachin of Judah were a signet ring on my right hand, I would pull you off
24Jr 22:25 and give you to those who are trying to kill you, whom you fear - that is, to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and the Chaldeans.
24Jr 22:26 I'll hurl you and the mother who gave birth to you into another land where you were not born, and there you will die.
24Jr 22:27 As for the land to which you want to return, you won't return there!
24Jr 22:28 "Is this man Jehoiachin a despised and shattered jar, a vessel no one wants?Why were he and his descendants hurled away, thrown into a land that they didn't know - 
24Jr 22:29 Land, land, land, listen to the word of the Lord!
24Jr 22:30 This is what the Lord says£º 'Write this man off as childless, a man who does not prosper in his lifetime. None of his descendants shall succeed in sitting on the throne of David, or ever ruling in Judah again.'"
24Jr 23:1 "How terrible for the shepherds who are destroying and scattering the sheep of my pasture!" declares the Lord.
24Jr 23:2 Therefore, this is what the Lord God of Israel says about the shepherds who are shepherding my people, "You have scattered my flock and driven them away. You haven't taken care of them, and now I'm about to take care of you because of your evil deeds," declares the Lord.
24Jr 23:3 "I'll gather the remnant of my flock from all the countries where I've driven them, and bring them back to their pasture where they'll be fruitful and increase in numbers.
24Jr 23:4 I'll raise up shepherds over them, and they'll shepherd them. My flock will no longer be afraid or terrified, and none will be missing," declares the Lord.
24Jr 23:5 "The time is coming," declares the Lord, "when I'll raise up a righteous branch for David. He will be a king who rules wisely, and he will administer justice and righteousness in the land.
24Jr 23:6 In his time Judah will be delivered and Israel will dwell in safety. This is the name by which he will be known£º 'The Lord Our Righteousness.'
24Jr 23:7 "Therefore, the time is coming," declares the Lord, "when people will no longer say, 'As surely as the Lord lives who brought up the Israelites from the land of Egypt,'
24Jr 23:8 but they'll say, 'As surely as the Lord lives who brought the descendants of the Israelites from the land of the north and from all the lands where I had driven them and brought them into the land.' Then they'll live in their own land."
24Jr 23:9 Concerning the prophets£º My heart is broken within me, and all my bones shake. I'm like a drunk man, like a person overcome with wine, because of the Lord, and because of his holy words.
24Jr 23:10 Indeed, the land is full of adulterers. Indeed, the land mourns because of the curse; the pastures of the wilderness have dried up. The adulterers' lifestyles are evil, and they use their strength for what is not right.
24Jr 23:11 Indeed, both priest and prophet are ungodly. Even in my house I find evil," declares the Lord.
24Jr 23:12 Therefore their way will be slippery. They'll be driven out into the darkness, where they'll fall. For I'll bring disaster on them, the year of their judgment," declares the Lord.
24Jr 23:13 "Among the prophets of Samaria I saw a disgusting thing, for they prophesied by Baal and led my people Israel astray.
24Jr 23:14 Among the prophets of Jerusalem I saw a horrible thing, for they commit adultery and live a lie. They strengthen the hands of those who do evil, so that no one repents of his evil. All of them are like Sodom to me, and her residents like Gomorrah."
24Jr 23:15 Therefore, this is what the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies says about the prophets, "I'm about to make them eat wormwood and drink poisoned water, because godlessness has spread from the prophets of Jerusalem throughout the land."
24Jr 23:16 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Don't listen to the words of the prophets who are prophesying to you; they're giving you false hopes. They declare visions from their own minds?they don't come from the Lord!
24Jr 23:17 They keep on saying to those who despise me, 'The Lord has said, "You will have peace."' To all who stubbornly follow their own desires they say, 'Disaster won't come upon you.'
24Jr 23:18 But who has stood in the Lord's council to see and hear his word?Who has paid attention to his word and obeyed it - 
24Jr 23:19 Look, the storm of the Lord's wrath has gone forth, a whirling tempest, and it will swirl down around the head of the wicked.
24Jr 23:20 The Lord's anger won't turn back until he has accomplished what he intended to do. In the future you will clearly understand it.
24Jr 23:21 I didn't send these prophets, but they ran anyway. I didn't speak to them, but they prophesied.
24Jr 23:22 If they had stood in my council and had delivered my words to my people, then they would have turned them back from their evil way, from their evil deeds."
24Jr 23:23 "Am I a God who is near," declares the Lord, "rather than a God who is far away - 
24Jr 23:24 If a person hides himself in secret places, will I not see him? declares the Lord. "I fill the heavens and the earth, do I not? declares the Lord.
24Jr 23:25 "I've heard what the prophets who prophesy lies in my name have said£º 'I had a dream; I had a dream.'
24Jr 23:26 How long will this go on?Is there anything in the hearts of the prophets who prophesy lies, and who prophesy from the deceit that is in their hearts - 
24Jr 23:27 With their dreams that they relate to one another, they plan to make my people forget my name just as their ancestors forgot my name by embracing Baal.
24Jr 23:28 Let the prophet who has a dream relate the dream, but let whoever receives my word speak my word truthfully. What does straw have in common with wheat? declares the Lord.
24Jr 23:29 "My word is like fire or like a hammer that shatters rock, is it not? declares the Lord.
24Jr 23:30 "Therefore, look, I'm against the prophets," declares the Lord, "who steal my words from each other.
24Jr 23:31 Look, I'm against the prophets," declares the Lord, "who use their tongues to issue a declaration.
24Jr 23:32 Look, I'm against those who prophesy based on false dreams," declares the Lord, "and relate them and lead my people astray with their lies and their recklessness. I didn't send them; I didn't command them, and they provide no benefit at all to these people," declares the Lord.
24Jr 23:33 "Jeremiah, when these people, the prophet, or a priest ask you, 'What is the oracle of the Lord? say to them, 'You are the burden, and I'll cast you out,'" declares the Lord.
24Jr 23:34 "As for the prophet, the priest, or the people who say, 'I have an oracle of the Lord,' I'll judge that person and his household.
24Jr 23:35 This is what you should say to one another and among yourselves, 'What has the Lord answered? or 'What has the Lord said?
24Jr 23:36 But you are to no longer mention the oracle of the Lord, because the oracle is only for the person to whom the Lord gives his word, and you have overturned the words of the living God, the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, our God.
24Jr 23:37 This is what you should say to the prophet, 'What has the Lord answered? or 'What has the Lord said?
24Jr 23:38 If you say, 'We have an oracle of the Lord,' therefore this is what the Lord says£º he will answer your word with this word, 'Burden of the Lord,' and I'll send you away with these words£º 'Don't say, "Oracle of the Lord."'
24Jr 23:39 Therefore I'll surely forget you and cast you and the city I gave you and your ancestors out of my presence.
24Jr 23:40 I'll bring on you everlasting reproach and everlasting humiliation that won't ever be forgotten."
24Jr 24:1 After Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had taken Jehoiakim's son Jeconiah, king of Judah, along with the officials of Judah, the craftsmen, and the smiths from Jerusalem into exile, and had brought them to Babylon, the Lord showed me two baskets of figs placed right in front of the temple of the Lord.
24Jr 24:2 One basket contained very good figs like the first figs that ripen on the tree. The other basket contained very bad figs that were too bad to be eaten.
24Jr 24:3 The Lord said to me, "What do you see? I replied, "Figs. The good figs are very good, and the bad figs are very bad. They're too bad to be eaten."
24Jr 24:4 Then the word of the Lord came to me£º 
24Jr 24:5 "This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'Like these good figs, so I'll regard as good the exiles of Judah whom I sent from this place to the land of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 24:6 I'll look at them with good intentions, and I'll bring them back to this land. I'll build them up. I won't tear them down; I'll plant them and not rip them up.
24Jr 24:7 I'll give them the ability to know me, for I am the Lord. They will be my people, and I will be their God when they return to me with all their heart.
24Jr 24:8 'Like the bad figs that are too bad to be eaten - for this is what the Lord says - so I'll give up on Zedekiah king of Judah, along with his officials, the remnant of Jerusalem that is left in this land, and those living in the land of Egypt.
24Jr 24:9 I'll make them into a horrifying sight to all the kingdoms of the earth; into a cause for contempt, into a byword, into a taunt, and into a curse in all the places to which I drive them.
24Jr 24:10 I'll send the sword, famine, and plague against them until they're completely destroyed from the land which I gave them and their ancestors.'"
24Jr 25:1 The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah concerning all the people of Judah in the fourth year of Josiah's son Jehoiakim, king of Judah. (This was also the first year of the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon.)
24Jr 25:2 This is what Jeremiah the prophet said to all the people of Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem£º 
24Jr 25:3 "From the thirteenth year of the reign of Ammon's son Josiah, the king of Judah, until the present time, for 23 years the word of the Lord has come to me, and I've spoken to you again and again, but you haven't listened.
24Jr 25:4 Again and again, the Lord sent all his servants, the prophets, to you, but you wouldn't listen or even turn your ears in my direction to hear.
24Jr 25:5 They said, 'Turn, each one of you, from your evil habits and evil deeds, and live in the land that the Lord gave to you and your ancestors forever and ever.
24Jr 25:6 Don't follow other gods to serve and worship them. Don't provoke me with the idols you make with your hands, and I won't bring disaster on you.'
24Jr 25:7 But you didn't listen to me," declares the Lord, "so as to provoke me with the idols you make with your hands to your own harm.3
24Jr 25:8 "Therefore, this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'Because you haven't listened to my word,
24Jr 25:9 I'm now sending for all the tribes from the north, declares the Lord, and for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. I'll bring them against this land, against its inhabitants, and against all these surrounding nations. I'll utterly destroy them and make them an object of horror and scorn, and an everlasting desolation.
24Jr 25:10 I'll destroy the sounds of gladness and rejoicing from them, the sounds of the bridegroom and the bride, the sound of the hand mill and also the light of the lamp.
24Jr 25:11 This entire land will be a desolation and a waste, and these nations will serve the king of Babylon for seventy years.
24Jr 25:12 'Then when the seventy years have passed, I'll judge the king of Babylon and that nation, declares the Lord, I'll judge the land of the Chaldeans for their iniquity and I'll make it a desolation forever.
24Jr 25:13 I'll bring on that land all the things I spoke against it, all that is written in this book, which Jeremiah prophesied about the nations.
24Jr 25:14 Indeed many nations and great kings will make slaves even of them, and I'll repay them according to their deeds, according to what they have done.'"
24Jr 25:15 For this is what the Lord God of Israel says to me, "Take this cup of the wine of burning anger from my hand and make all the nations to whom I send you drink it.
24Jr 25:16 They'll drink, stagger, and act like madmen because of the sword I'm sending among them."
24Jr 25:17 So I took the cup from the Lord's hand, and I made all the nations to whom the Lord sent me drink it£º 
24Jr 25:18 Jerusalem, the cities of Judah, its kings and officials to make them into a ruin, an object of horror and scorn, and a curse, as it is this day;
24Jr 25:19 Pharaoh, king of Egypt, his officials, his princes, and all his people;
24Jr 25:20 all the various people; all the kings of the land of Uz, all the kings of the land of the Philistines, Ashkelon, Gaza, Ekron, and what remains of Ashdod;
24Jr 25:21 Edom, Moab, and the people of Ammon;
24Jr 25:22 all the kings of Tyre, all the kings of Sidon, and all the kings of the coast lands that are beyond the sea;
24Jr 25:23 Dedan, Tema, Buz, and those who shave the corners of their beards;
24Jr 25:24 all the kings of Arabia and all the kings of the various people who live in the desert;
24Jr 25:25 all the kings of Zimri, all the kings of Elam, and all the kings of Media;
24Jr 25:26 all the kings of the north near and far, one after another, and all the kingdoms of the world on the face of the earth. The king of Sheshak will drink after all the others.
24Jr 25:27 "You are to say to them, 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "Drink, get drunk, and vomit! Fall down and don't get up because of the sword I'm sending among you."'
24Jr 25:28 And if they refuse to take the cup from your hand to drink it, say to them, 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "You will surely drink it!
24Jr 25:29 Look, I'm beginning to bring disaster on the city that is called by my name, and do you actually think you will avoid punishment?You won't avoid punishment because I'm summoning the sword against all those who live in the land," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.'
24Jr 25:30 You are to prophesy all these things against them, and you are to say to them, 'The Lord roars from his high place, from his holy dwelling he lifts his voice. He roars loudly against his flock, and against all who live on the earth; he shouts like those treading grapes.
24Jr 25:31 A tumult reaches to the ends of the earth because the Lord is bringing an indictment against the nations. He judges all flesh. He has given the wicked over to the sword,' declares the Lord."
24Jr 25:32 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Look, disaster is going from nation to nation, a great storm is being stirred up from the most distant parts of the earth."
24Jr 25:33 Those slain by the Lord on that day will extend from one end of the earth to the other. They won't be mourned for or gathered up or buried. They'll be like dung on the surface of the ground.
24Jr 25:34 "Scream, you shepherds! Cry out! Roll in the dust, you leaders of the flock! Indeed, the time for your slaughter and your dispersion has arrived, and you will break like a choice vessel.
24Jr 25:35 Flight will be impossible for the shepherds, as will be escape for the leaders of the flock.
24Jr 25:36 A sound - it's the cry of the shepherds and the scream of the leaders of the flock?because the Lord is destroying their pastures.
24Jr 25:37 The peaceful meadows are silent because of the Lord's fierce anger.
24Jr 25:38 Like a lion, he has left his den. Indeed, their land has become a waste because of the anger of the oppressor and because of the Lord's fierce anger."
24Jr 26:1 In the beginning of the reign of Josiah's son Jehoiakim, king of Judah, this word came from the Lord£º 
24Jr 26:2 "This is what the Lord says£º 'Stand in the courtyard of the LORD's temple and tell those from all the cities of Judah who are coming to worship at the LORD's temple everything that I've commanded you to say to them. Don't leave out a word!
24Jr 26:3 Perhaps they'll listen, and each of them will repent from his evil way. Then I'll change my mind about the disaster I'm planning to bring on them because of their evil deeds.
24Jr 26:4 Say to them, "This is what the Lord says£º 'If you don't listen to me to follow my Law which I've set before you,
24Jr 26:5 and listen to the words of my servants, the prophets, whom I've sent to you over and over - but you wouldn't listen - 
24Jr 26:6 then I'll make this house like Shiloh and make this city into a curse to all the nations of the earth.'"'"
24Jr 26:7 The priests, the prophets, and all the people listened as Jeremiah spoke these words at the LORD's temple.
24Jr 26:8 As soon as Jeremiah finished saying everything that the Lord had commanded him to say to all the people, the priests, the prophets, and all the people seized him, telling him as they did£º "You must certainly die!
24Jr 26:9 Why have you prophesied in the name of the Lord that this house will be like Shiloh, and this city will be without an inhabitant? Then all the people gathered around Jeremiah at the LORD's temple.
24Jr 26:10 When the Judean officials heard all these things, they came up from the king's house to the LORD's temple and sat in the doorway of the New Gate of the LORD's temple.
24Jr 26:11 The priests and prophets said to the officials and to all the people, "A death sentence for this man, because he prophesied against this city, as you heard with your own ears!"
24Jr 26:12 Then Jeremiah spoke to all the officials and to all the people£º "The Lord has sent me to prophesy all the things you heard against this house and against this city.
24Jr 26:13 Now, change your habits and your deeds and obey the Lord your God, and the Lord will change his mind about the disaster that he told you about.
24Jr 26:14 Look, I'm in your hands, so do with me what you think is good and right.
24Jr 26:15 But know for certain that if you kill me, you will bring innocent blood on yourselves and on this city and its residents because the Lord really did send me to you to say all these things for you to hear."
24Jr 26:16 The officials and all the people said to the priests and the prophets, "No death sentence for this man because he has spoken to us in the name of the Lord our God."
24Jr 26:17 Some of the elders of the land got up and said to all the assembled people,
24Jr 26:18 "Micah of Moresheth prophesied during the reign of Hezekiah king of Judah to all the people of Judah, 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Zion will be a plowed field, and Jerusalem a ruin. The temple mount will be a wooded hill.'"
24Jr 26:19 "Did Hezekiah king of Judah or anyone in Judah kill him?Didn't he fear the Lord and seek the Lord's favor, and so the Lord changed his mind about the disaster that he had spoken to them about. We're bringing great disaster on ourselves.
24Jr 26:20 There was also a man named Uriah, Shemiah's son from Keriath-jearim, who prophesied in the Lord's name. He prophesied about this city and this land in words similar to those of Jeremiah.
24Jr 26:21 King Jehoiakim, all his troops, and all the officials heard his words, and the king sought to kill him. Uriah heard about this and was afraid, so he fled and went to Egypt.
24Jr 26:22 King Jehoiakim sent men to Egypt. He sent Achbor's son Elnathan, along with a contingent of men into Egypt.
24Jr 26:23 They brought Uriah out of Egypt and brought him to king Jehoiakim, who killed him with a sword. Then they threw his body into a common grave."
24Jr 26:24 Yet because Shaphan's son Ahikam supported Jeremiah, he was not handed over to the people for them to kill.
24Jr 27:1 At the beginning of the reign of Josiah's son Jehoiakim, king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord£º 
24Jr 27:2 this is what the Lord says to me£º "Make restraints and yokes for yourself and put them on your neck.
24Jr 27:3 Then send messengers to the king of Edom, the king of Moab, the king of the Ammonites, the king of Tyre, and the king of Sidon through the envoys who come to Jerusalem to king Zedekiah of Judah.
24Jr 27:4 Give them this order for their masters£º 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says, and this is what you are to say to your masters,
24Jr 27:5 By my great power and outstretched arm I made the earth, mankind, and the animals that are on the face of the earth, and I give it to whomever I see fit.
24Jr 27:6 Now I've given all these lands to my servant, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and I've even given him the wild animals to serve him.
24Jr 27:7 All the nations will serve him, his son, and his grandson until his country's time also comes, and then many nations and great kings will use him as a slave.
24Jr 27:8 If a nation and kingdom does not serve him - King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon - and does not put its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon, I'll judge that nation with the sword, with famine, and with plague," declares the Lord, "until I've completely destroyed it by his hand.
24Jr 27:9 You aren't to listen to your prophets, your diviners, your dreamers, your soothsayers, and your sorcerers who say to you, 'Don't serve the king of Babylon.'
24Jr 27:10 They're prophesying a lie to you in order to remove you far away from your land. I'll drive you out and you will perish.
24Jr 27:11 But I'll let the nation that brings its neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon and serves him remain in its own land," declares the Lord, "and they'll work it and remain in it."
24Jr 27:12 I spoke to Zedekiah king of Judah using words like these£º "Bring your neck under the yoke of the king of Babylon. Serve him and his people, and you will live!
24Jr 27:13 Why should you and your people die by the sword, by famine, and by plague as the Lord has decreed about the nation that does not serve the king of Babylon - 
24Jr 27:14 Don't listen to the words of the prophets who say to you, 'You won't serve the king of Babylon. Indeed, they're prophesying a lie to you.
24Jr 27:15 For I didn't send them," declares the Lord, "and they're falsely prophesying in my name, so I will drive both you and the prophets who prophesy to you out of the land."13
24Jr 27:16 Then I spoke to the priests and all this people£º "This is what the Lord says£º 'Don't listen to the words of the prophets who prophesy to you£º "The vessels from the temple are about to be returned from Babylon very soon now." Indeed, they're prophesying a lie to you.
24Jr 27:17 Don't listen to them! Serve the king of Babylon and you'll live. Why should this city become a ruin - 
24Jr 27:18 If they're prophets, and if they have a word from the Lord, let them plead with the Lord of the Heavenly Armies so that the utensils that remain in the LORD's temple, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem might not be taken to Babylon.
24Jr 27:19 For this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says about the pillars, the bronze sea, the stands, and the rest of the vessels that remain in this city
24Jr 27:20 that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon didn't take when he took Jehoiakim's son Jeconiah, king of Judah, and all the nobles of Judah and Jerusalem from Jerusalem into exile to Babylon - 
24Jr 27:21 For this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel says about the vessels that remain in the LORD's temple, in the house of the king of Judah, and in Jerusalem,
24Jr 27:22 "They'll go into Babylon and there they'll remain until the time I take note of them," declares the Lord. "Then I'll bring them up and return them to this place."'"27
24Jr 28:1 In that same year, in the beginning of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, in the fourth year and the fifth month, Azur's son Hananiah, the prophet from Gibeon, said to me at the LORD's temple in front of the priests and all the people,
24Jr 28:2 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º 'I've broken the yoke of the king of Babylon,
24Jr 28:3 and within two years I'll bring back to this place all the vessels of the LORD's temple that Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon took from this place and carried to Babylon.
24Jr 28:4 I'll bring back Jehoiakim's son Jeconiah, king of Judah, and all the exiles of Judah who went to Babylon to this place,' declares the Lord, 'for I'll break the yoke of the king of Babylon.'" 
24Jr 28:5 The prophet Jeremiah spoke to the prophet Hananiah in front of the priests and all the people who were standing in the LORD's temple.
24Jr 28:6 The prophet Jeremiah said, "May the Lord truly do this thing! May the Lord fulfill the words that you prophesied to bring back the vessels of the LORD's temple and all the exiles from Babylon to this place.
24Jr 28:7 But please listen to this what I'm speaking in your hearing and in the hearing of all the people.
24Jr 28:8 The prophets who came before us from ancient times prophesied war, famine, and plague against many lands and great kingdoms.
24Jr 28:9 When a prophet prophesies peace, and what the prophet speaks comes about, he will be known as the prophet whom the Lord has truly sent."
24Jr 28:10 Then the prophet Hananiah took the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet and broke it.
24Jr 28:11 Hananiah, in front of all the people, said, "This is what the Lord says£º 'In the same way, within two years, I'll break the yoke of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon from the neck of all the nations.'" Then Jeremiah the prophet went on his way
24Jr 28:12 The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after the prophet Hananiah had broken the yoke from the neck of Jeremiah the prophet£º 
24Jr 28:13 "Go and say to Hananiah, 'This is what the Lord says£º "You have broken wooden yokes, but you have made iron yokes in their place."
24Jr 28:14 For this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "I've put an iron yoke on the necks of all these nations to serve Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. They'll serve him, and I've even given the wild animals to him."'" 
24Jr 28:15 The prophet Jeremiah said to the prophet Hananiah, "Listen, Hananiah! The Lord didn't send you, and you are causing these people to trust in a lie.
24Jr 28:16 Therefore, this is what the Lord says£º 'I'm about to remove you from the face of the earth. This year you will die because you have preached rebellion against the Lord.'"
24Jr 28:17 So the prophet Hananiah died in the seventh month of that year.
24Jr 29:1 These are the words of the letter that the prophet Jeremiah sent from Jerusalem to there maining elders among the exiles, to the priests, to the prophets, and toall the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had taken in to exile from Jerusalem to Babylon,
24Jr 29:2 after King Jeconiah, the queen mother, the palace officials, the officials of Judah and Jerusalem, the craftsmen, and the smiths left Jerusalem.
24Jr 29:3 The letter was sent by Shaphan's son Elasah and by Hilkiah's son Gemariah, whom King Zedekiah of Judah sent to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon in Babylon, and it said,
24Jr 29:4 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says to all the exiles who were taken from Jerusalem into exile to Babylon,
24Jr 29:5 'Build houses and live in them. Plant gardens and eat their produce.
24Jr 29:6 Take wives and father sons and daughters. Take wives for your sons and give your daughters in marriage, so they may have sons and daughters. Increase in numbers there, don't decrease.
24Jr 29:7 Seek the welfare of the city to which I've exiled you and pray to the Lord for it, for your welfare depends on its welfare.'
24Jr 29:8 "For this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º 'Don't let the prophets and diviners who are among you deceive you, and don't listen to them when they tell you their dreams.
24Jr 29:9 Indeed, they're prophesying lies to you in my name. I didn't send them," declares the Lord.1
24Jr 29:10 "For this is what the Lord says£º 'When Babylon's seventy years are completed, I'll take note of you and will fulfill my good promises to you by bringing you back to this place.
24Jr 29:11 For I know the plans that I have for you,' declares the Lord, 'plans for well-being, and not for calamity, in order to give you a future and a hope.
24Jr 29:12 When you call out to me and come and pray to me, I'll hear you.
24Jr 29:13 You will seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart.
24Jr 29:14 I'll be found by you,' declares the Lord, 'and I'll restore your security and gather you from all the nations and all the places to which I've driven you,' declares the Lord. 'I'll bring you back to the place from which I sent you into exile.'
24Jr 29:15 "Indeed, you have said, 'The Lord has raised up prophets for us in Babylon.'
24Jr 29:16 "But this is what the Lord says about the king who sits on David's throne, and about the people who live in this city - your brothers who didn't go with you into exile£º 
24Jr 29:17 This is what the Lord says£º 'I'm about to send the sword, famine, and plague on them, and I'll make them like rotten figs that cannot be eaten because they're so bad.
24Jr 29:18 I'll pursue them with the sword, with famine, and with plague, and I'll make them a horrifying sight to all the kingdoms of the earth. I'll make them a curse, an object of horror, and scorn, and a desolation in all the nations to which I've driven them,
24Jr 29:19 because they didn't listen to my words,' declares the Lord. 'When I sent my servants, the prophets, to you again and again, you didn't listen,' declares the Lord. 
24Jr 29:20 "Now, all you exiles whom I sent from Jerusalem to Babylon, listen to the word of the Lord!
24Jr 29:21 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says about Kolaiah's son Ahab and Maaseiah's son Zedekiah, who are prophesying lies to you in my name, 'I'm about to give them into the domination of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and he will kill them before your eyes.
24Jr 29:22 What happens to them will be the basis for a curse for all the Judean exiles who are in Babylon. People will say, "May the Lord make you like Zedekiah and Ahab, whom the Lord roasted in the fire,
24Jr 29:23 because they did something stupid in Israel. They committed adultery with their neighbors' wives, and in my name they spoke lies that I didn't command them. I'm the one who knows, and I'm a witness," declares the Lord.'"
24Jr 29:24 You are to say to Shemaiah of Nehelam£º 
24Jr 29:25 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º 'Because you sent letters in your own name to all the people who are in Jerusalem, to Maaseiah's son Zephaniah the priest and to all the priests£º 
24Jr 29:26 "The Lord made you a priest instead of Jehoiada the priest to serve in the LORD's temple as an official against every crazy prophet, and to put him in stocks and restraints.
24Jr 29:27 And now, why didn't you rebuke Jeremiah from Anathoth who prophesies to you - 
24Jr 29:28 So he sent a message to us in Babylon£º 'The exile will be long, so build houses and live in them. Plant gardens and eat their produce.'"'"
24Jr 29:29 Then Zephaniah the priest read this letter to Jeremiah the prophet,
24Jr 29:30 and the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah£º 
24Jr 29:31 "Send a message to all the exiles£º 'This is what the Lord says about Shemaiah from Nehelam, "Because Shemaiah has prophesied to you, even though I didn't send him, and has made you trust a lie,"
24Jr 29:32 therefore, this is what the Lord says£º "I'm about to judge Shemaiah from Nehelam along with his descendants. He won't have anyone related to him living among these people. Nor will he see the good that I'll do for my people, declares the Lord, "because he advocated rebellion against the Lord."'
24Jr 30:1 This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah from the Lord£º 
24Jr 30:2 "This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'Write all the words that I've spoken to you in a book.
24Jr 30:3 Indeed, the time will come,' declares the Lord, 'when I'll restore the security of my people Israel and Judah,' says the Lord. 'I'll bring them back to the land that I gave to their ancestors, and they'll possess it.'"
24Jr 30:4 These are the words that the Lord spoke about Israel and Judah£º 
24Jr 30:5 "Indeed, this is what the Lord says£º 'We have heard a sound of terror and of fear, and there is no peace.
24Jr 30:6 Ask about this and think about it?Can a man give birth to a child?Why then do I see every strong man with his hands on his thighs like a woman giving birth, and all their faces have turned pale - 
24Jr 30:7 Oh how terrible! That time will be worse than any like it. It will be a time of trouble for Jacob, but he will be rescued from it.
24Jr 30:8 'On that day,' declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, 'I'll break the yoke from your neck and will tear off your restraints. Foreigners will no longer make you serve them.
24Jr 30:9 'Rather, they will serve the Lord their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them.
24Jr 30:10 'My servant Jacob, don't be afraid,' declares the Lord, 'and Israel, don't be dismayed. For I'll deliver you from a distant place and your descendants from the land of their captivity. Jacob will return. He will be undisturbed and secure, and no one will cause him to fear.
24Jr 30:11 For I'll be with you to save you,' declares the Lord. For I'll put an end to all the nations where I scattered you; but I won't make an end of you. I'll discipline you justly, but I certainly won't leave you unpunished.'
24Jr 30:12 "For this is what the Lord says£º 'Your injury won't heal, your wound is severe.
24Jr 30:13 There is no one to plead your cause. There is no medicine for your sore, no healing for you.
24Jr 30:14 All your lovers have forgotten you; they don't seek you. Indeed, I've struck you down with the blow of an enemy, with the punishment of a cruel foe because your wickedness is great, and your sins are numerous.
24Jr 30:15 Why do you cry out because of your injury?Your wound won't heal. Because your wickedness is severe, and your sins are numerous I've done all these things to you.
24Jr 30:16 In addition, all who devour you will be devoured, and all your oppressors - all of them?will go into captivity. Those who plunder you will become plunder, and all who spoil you will become spoil.
24Jr 30:17 Indeed, I'll bring you healing, and I'll heal you of your wounds,' declares the Lord, because they have called you an outcast and have said, "It is Zion, no one cares for her!"'"
24Jr 30:18 "This is what the Lord says£º 'I'm going to restore the fortunes of the tents of Jacob and have compassion on his dwellings. A city will be rebuilt on its ruins and a palace will sit on its rightful place.
24Jr 30:19 Thanksgiving and the sounds of laughter will come out of them. I'll cause them to increase in numbers and not decrease. I'll honor them and not make them insignificant.30
24Jr 30:20 Their children will be as they were before, and their congregation will be established before me. I'll punish all who oppress them.
24Jr 30:21 Their leader will be one of their own, and their ruler will come from among them. I'll bring him near, and he will approach me, for who would otherwise dare to approach me? declares the Lord.
24Jr 30:22 'You will be my people, and I'll be your God.'"
24Jr 30:23 Look, the storm of the Lord! His wrath has gone forth, a twisting storm. It will swirl around the head of the wicked.
24Jr 30:24 The fierce anger of the Lord won't turn back until he has accomplished and established the plan of his heart. In the days to come, you will understand this.
24Jr 31:1 "At that time," declares the Lord, "I'll be the God of all the families of Israel, and they will be my people."
24Jr 31:2 This is what the Lord says£º "The people who survived the sword, found favor in the desert while Israel was seeking rest.
24Jr 31:3 The Lord appeared to Israel from far away and said, "I've loved you with an everlasting love, therefore I've drawn you with gracious love.
24Jr 31:4 I'll again build you, and you will be rebuilt, Virgin Israel! You will again take up your tambourines and go out to dance with those who are filled with joy.
24Jr 31:5 You will again plant vineyards on the hills of Samaria where planters had planted and defiled the fruit.
24Jr 31:6 For there will be a day when the watchmen will call out on the hills of Ephraim, 'Arise, let's go up to Zion to the Lord our God.'"
24Jr 31:7 For this is what the Lord says£º "Cry out with joy for Jacob and shout for the chief among the nations. Announce, give praise, and say, 'Lord, save your people, the remnant of Israel.'
24Jr 31:8 Look, I'm bringing them from the northern region, and I'll gather them from the farthest parts of the earth. among them will be the blind and the lame, together with the pregnant woman and the woman in labor. A large group will return here.
24Jr 31:9 They'll come crying, and I'll lead them as they pray for mercy. I'll make them walk by streams of water, along a straight path on which they won't stumble. For I am Israel's father, and Ephraim is my firstborn."
24Jr 31:10 Nations, listen to the word of the Lord, and declare it in the distant coastlands. Say, "The one who scattered Israel will gather him and keep him as a shepherd keeps his flock."
24Jr 31:11 For the Lord will deliver Jacob and redeem him from the hand of one stronger than he.
24Jr 31:12 They'll come and cry out with joy on the heights of Zion. They'll be radiant over the Lord's goodness, over the grain, the new wine, the fresh oil, and over the young of the flocks and herds. Their lives will be like a well-watered garden. They'll never again grow faint.
24Jr 31:13 The virgins will rejoice with dancing together with young men and old men. For I'll turn their mourning into joy, and I'll comfort them and give them gladness instead of sorrow.
24Jr 31:14 I'll give the priests abundant provisions, and my people will be satisfied with my goodness," declares the Lord.
24Jr 31:15 This is what the Lord says£º "A voice is heard in Ramah, lamentation and bitter crying. Rachel is crying, and she refuses to be comforted for her children, because they are no longer alive."
24Jr 31:16 This is what the Lord says£º "Restrain your voice from crying, and your eyes from tears, for there is a reward for your work," declares the Lord. "They'll return from the enemy's land.
24Jr 31:17 There is hope for your future," declares the Lord. "Your children will return to their own territory."
24Jr 31:18 "I've certainly heard Ephraim shuddering with grief as they said, 'You have disciplined me, and I'm disciplined like an untrained calf. Restore me, and let me return, for you are the Lord my God.
24Jr 31:19 Indeed, after I turned away, then I repented. And after I came to understand, I slapped my forehead. I was both ashamed and humiliated because I bear the disgrace of my youth.'"
24Jr 31:20 "Is Ephraim my dear son?Is he a darling child?Indeed, as often as I've spoken about him, I surely still remember him. Therefore I deeply yearn for him. I'll surely have great compassion on him," declares the Lord.
24Jr 31:21 Set up markers for yourselves. Erect signposts for yourselves. Pay attention to the highway, to the road you traveled. Return, virgin Israel, return to these cities of yours.
24Jr 31:22 How long will you go this way and that, rebellious daughter?Indeed, the Lord will create a new thing on the earth; a woman will protect a man.
24Jr 31:23 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "They'll again speak this word in the land of Judah and its towns when I restore their fortunes, 'The Lord bless you, righteous dwelling, holy mountain.'
24Jr 31:24 Judah and all its towns will live together in the land, along with farmers and those who follow the flock.
24Jr 31:25 I'll provide abundance for those who are weary, and fill all who are faint."
24Jr 31:26 Then I awoke and looked around, and I had had a pleasant sleep.
24Jr 31:27 "Look, days are coming," declares the Lord, "when I'll sow the house of Israel and the house of Judah using people and animals as seed.
24Jr 31:28 Just as I've watched over them to pull up, tear down, overthrow, destroy, and bring disaster, so I'll watch over them to build and to plant," declares the Lord.
24Jr 31:29 "In those days people will no longer say, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, but the children's teeth have been set on edge.'
24Jr 31:30 Instead, each person will die for his own iniquity. Everyone who eats sour grapes will have his own teeth set on edge."
24Jr 31:31 "Look, days are coming," declares the Lord, "when I'll make a new covenant with the house of Israel and the house of Judah.
24Jr 31:32 It won't be like the covenant I made with their ancestors on the day I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. They broke my covenant, although I was a husband to them," declares the Lord.
24Jr 31:33 Rather, this is the covenant that I'll make with the house of Israel after those days," declares the Lord. "I'll put my Law within them and will write it on their hearts. I'll be their God and they will be my people.
24Jr 31:34 No longer will a person teach his neighbor or his relative£º 'Know the Lord.' Instead, they'll all know me, from the least to the greatest of them," declares the Lord. "Indeed, I'll forgive their iniquity, and I'll remember their sin no more."
24Jr 31:35 This is what the Lord says, who gives the sun for light by day, the laws that govern the moon and stars for light by night, and who stirs up the sea so that its waves roar. The Lord of the Heavenly Armies is his name£º 
24Jr 31:36 "If these laws cease to function in my presence," declares the Lord, "then the descendants of Israel will cease to be a nation in my presence for all time!"
24Jr 31:37 This is what the Lord says£º "If the heavens could be measured above, or the foundations of the earth be searched out below, then I also would reject all the descendants of Israel because of everything they have done," declares the Lord.
24Jr 31:38 "Look, days are coming," declares the Lord, "when the city of the Lord will be rebuilt from the Tower of Hananel to the Corner Gate.
24Jr 31:39 A measuring line will go straight out from there to the hill of Gareb, and then it will turn to Goath.
24Jr 31:40 The whole valley of dead bodies and ashes and all the fields as far as the Brook Kidron to the corner of the Horse Gate toward the east will be holy to the Lord. It won't be uprooted or overthrown again, forever."
24Jr 32:1 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord in the tenth year of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah. It was the eighteenth year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar.
24Jr 32:2 The army of the king of Babylon was then besieging Jerusalem, and Jeremiah the prophet was confined in the courtyard of the guard at the palace of the king of Judah
24Jr 32:3 where Zedekiah had confined him. Zedekiah had said, "Why did you prophesy and say these things?You said, 'This is what the Lord says£º "I'm about to give this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.
24Jr 32:4 Zedekiah king of Judah won't escape from the Chaldeans, for he has surely been given over to the king of Babylon. He will speak to him face to face and look at him eye to eye.
24Jr 32:5 The king of Babylon will take Zedekiah to Babylon and there he will stay until I judge him," declares the Lord. If you fight against the Chaldeans, you won't succeed."'"
24Jr 32:6 Jeremiah replied, "The word of the Lord came to me£º 
24Jr 32:7 'Look, Hanamel, your cousin, is coming to you and will say, "Buy my field in Anathoth for yourself, because the right of redemption to buy it belongs to you."'
24Jr 32:8 Then my cousin Hanamel came to me in the courtyard of the guard just as the Lord had said, and he said to me, 'Please buy my field in Anathoth in the territory of Benjamin because you have the right to possess it, and the right to redeem it belongs to you. Buy it for yourself.' So I knew that this was the word of the Lord.
24Jr 32:9 "Then I bought the field in Anathoth from my cousin Hanamel. I weighed out the silver for him?seventeen shekels of silver.
24Jr 32:10 I signed the deed and sealed it. I called in witnesses and used scales to weigh out the silver.
24Jr 32:11 Then I took the deed of purchase - both the sealed one with the terms and conditions and the open one - 12and I gave the deed of purchase to Neriah's son Baruch, the grandson of Mahseiah, in the presence of my cousin Hanamel, in the presence of the witnesses who signed the deed of pu rchase, and in the presence of all the Judeans sitting in the courtyard of the guard.
24Jr 32:13 In their presence, I instructed Baruch as follows£º 
24Jr 32:14 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "Take these deeds?both this sealed deed of purchase and this open deed - and put them in a clay pot so they'll last for a long time."
24Jr 32:15 For this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "Houses, fields, and vineyards will again be bought in this land."'
24Jr 32:16 "After I had given the deed of purchase to Neriah's son Baruch, I prayed to the Lord£º 
24Jr 32:17 'Lord! Look, you made the heavens and the earth with your great power and your outstretched arm. Nothing is too difficult for you!
24Jr 32:18 You, the great God, the mighty one, show gracious love to thousands and repay the parents' iniquity to their children after them. The Lord of the Heavenly Armies is his name.
24Jr 32:19 You are great in regards to your purposes and mighty in regards to your works. Your eyes are open to everything that people do, and will reward each one according to their ways and just as their actions deserve.
24Jr 32:20 You are the one who performed signs and wonders in the land of Egypt and continue to do so until this day, both in Israel and among the rest of humanity. You made a reputation for yourself that continues to this day.
24Jr 32:21 By your strong hand and outstretched arm, and with great terror, you brought your people Israel out of the land of Egypt with signs and wonders.
24Jr 32:22 And you gave them this land which you had promised their ancestors that you would give them?a land flowing with milk and honey.
24Jr 32:23 They came and took possession of it, but they didn't obey you or walk according to your Law. They didn't do what you commanded them to do, so you caused all this calamity to happen to them.
24Jr 32:24 Look, the siege ramps have reached the city to take it. Because of the sword, famine, and plague, the city has been given over to the Chaldeans who are fighting against it. What you said has happened, and you are watching it occur!
24Jr 32:25 Lord, you have told me, "Buy the field for yourself with money and call in witnesses," even though the city is being given over to the Chaldeans.'"
24Jr 32:26 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah£º 
24Jr 32:27 "Look, I am the Lord, the God who rules over all flesh. Is anything too difficult for me?
24Jr 32:28 Therefore, this is what the Lord says£º "I'm about to give this city into the hands of the Chaldeans and Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, and he will capture it.
24Jr 32:29 The Chaldeans who are fighting against this city will come, set this city on fire, and burn it along with the houses on whose roofs incense was burned to Baal and liquid offerings were poured out to other gods in order to provoke me.
24Jr 32:30 Indeed, the Israelites and Judeans have been doing only evil in my presence since their youth. Indeed, the Israelites have done nothing but provoke me by what they have made with their hands," declares the Lord.
24Jr 32:31 "Indeed, this city has provoked me to anger and wrath from the day they built it until now, and so I'll remove it from my sight
24Jr 32:32 because of all the evil that the Israelites and Judeans have done to provoke me. They, their kings, their officials, their priests, their prophets, the people of Judah, and those living in Jerusalem have done these things.
24Jr 32:33 They have turned their backs to me rather than their faces. Even though I taught them, teaching them again and again, they didn't listen to accept correction.
24Jr 32:34 They put their detestable idols in the house that is called by my name and defiled it.
24Jr 32:35 They built the high places of Baal that are in the Hinnom Valley in order to sacrifice their sons and daughters to Molech?something that I didn't command, nor did it ever enter my mind for them to require this utterly repugnant thing - and lead Judah into sin."
24Jr 32:36 "Now therefore, says the Lord God of Israel concerning this city about which you are saying, 'It is being given into the hand of the king of Babylon by sword, famine, and plague.'
24Jr 32:37 I'm about to gather my people from all the lands where I've driven them in my anger, wrath, and great indignation. I'll bring them back to this place and let them live in safety.
24Jr 32:38 They'll be my people, and I'll be their God.
24Jr 32:39 I'll give them one heart and one lifestyle so they'll fear me always for their own good and for the good of their descendants after them.
24Jr 32:40 I'll make an everlasting covenant with them that I won't turn away from doing good for them. I'll put the fear of me in their hearts so they won't turn away from me.
24Jr 32:41 I'll rejoice over them to do good for them, and I'll faithfully plant them in this land with all my heart and soul.
24Jr 32:42 "Indeed, this is what the Lord says£º 'Just as I'm bringing all this great disaster on this people, so I'll bring on them all the good things that I'm promising concerning them.
24Jr 32:43 Fields will be bought in this land about which you will say, "It is a desolate place without people or animals. It is given into the hands of the Chaldeans."
24Jr 32:44 People will buy fields for money, sign deeds, seal them, and call witnesses in the land of Benjamin, in the areas around Jerusalem, in the towns of Judah, the towns of the hill country, the towns of the Shephelah, and the towns of the Negev, for I'll restore their fortunes,' declares the Lord."
24Jr 33:1 The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah a second time while he was still confined in the courtyard of the guard£º 
24Jr 33:2 "This is what the Lord says who made the earth, the Lord who formed it in order to establish it?whose name is the Lord - 
24Jr 33:3 'Call to me and I'll answer you, and will tell you about great and hidden things that you don't know.'
24Jr 33:4 For this is what the Lord God of Israel says about the houses of this city and the houses of the kings of Judah that were torn down to defend against the siege ramps and the sword,
24Jr 33:5 'The Chaldeans are coming to fight and to fill those houses with the dead bodies of the people that I've struck down in my anger and wrath, for I've hidden my face from this city because of all their wickedness.
24Jr 33:6 'Look, I'll bring restoration and healing to it, and I'll heal them. I'll reveal to them an abundance of peace and faithfulness.
24Jr 33:7 I'll restore the security of Judah and Israel and rebuild them as they were at first.
24Jr 33:8 I'll cleanse them from all their sin that they have committed against me, and I'll forgive all their sins that they committed against me and by which they rebelled against me.
24Jr 33:9 Jerusalem will be for me a name of joy, praise, and glory to all the nations of the earth that hear about all the good that I'm doing for them. They'll fear and tremble because of all the good and because of all the peace that I'm bringing to Jerusalem.'
24Jr 33:10 "This is what the Lord says£º 'You are saying about this place, "It is a ruin without people and without animals." Yet in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem which are desolate places without inhabitants and without animals, there will again be heard
24Jr 33:11 the sounds of rejoicing and gladness, the sounds of the bridegroom and the bride, and the sounds of those saying, 'Give thanks to the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, for the Lord is good, and his gracious love lasts forever,' as they bring thanksgiving offerings to the LORD's temple. For I'll restore the fortunes of the land as they were at first," declares the Lord.
24Jr 33:12 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'In this place that is now a ruin without people or animals, and in all its towns there will again be pasture for shepherds resting their flocks.
24Jr 33:13 In the towns of the hill country, in the towns of the Shephelah, in the towns of the Negev, in the territory of Benjamin, in the areas around Jerusalem, and in the towns of Judah flocks will again pass under the hands of the one who counts them,' says the Lord."
24Jr 33:14 "'Look, the time is coming,' declares the Lord, 'when I'll fulfill the good promise that I spoke concerning the house of Israel and Judah.
24Jr 33:15 In those days and at that time I'll cause a righteous Branch to spring up for David, and he will uphold justice and righteousness in the land.
24Jr 33:16 At that time Judah will be delivered and Jerusalem will dwell in safety. And this is the name people will call it, "The Lord is Our Righteousness."'
24Jr 33:17 For this is what the Lord says£º 'David will never be without a man sitting on the throne of the house of Israel,
24Jr 33:18 nor will the Levitical priests be without a man offering up burnt offerings, bringing in grain offerings, and offering sacrifices continually before me.'"
24Jr 33:19 The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah£º 
24Jr 33:20 "This is what the Lord says£º 'If you could break my covenant with the day and night so that day and night wouldn't occur at the proper time,
24Jr 33:21 then my covenant with my servant David might also be broken so that he wouldn't have a son sitting on his throne, and so also with my servants the Levitical priests.
24Jr 33:22 As the heavenly bodies cannot be counted, and the sands of the sea cannot be measured, so I'll multiply the descendants of my servant David and the Levites who serve me.'"
24Jr 33:23 The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah£º 
24Jr 33:24 "Haven't you noticed what these people have been saying?'The Lord rejected the two families that he had chosen!' They have contempt for my people and no longer consider them a nation.
24Jr 33:25 This is what the Lord says£º 'If I had not established my covenant for day and night and the laws that govern the heavens and earth,
24Jr 33:26 then I might reject the descendants of Jacob and my servant David by not taking some of his descendants as rulers over the descendants of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Indeed, I'll restore their fortunes, and I'll have compassion on them.'"
24Jr 34:1 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord while Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, all his army, all the kingdoms of the earth that were under his authority, along with all the people were fighting against Jerusalem and all its towns£º 
24Jr 34:2 This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'Go and speak to Zedekiah king of Judah. Say to him, "This is what the Lord says£º 'Look, I'm giving this city into the hand of the king of Babylon, and he will set it on fire.
24Jr 34:3 You won't escape from him. You will certainly be captured and given into his control. You will see the king of Babylon eye to eye, he will speak to you face to face, and you will go to Babylon.'"'
24Jr 34:4 Yet, hear the word of the Lord, Zedekiah king of Judah. This is what the Lord says to you, 'You won't die by the sword.
24Jr 34:5 You will die peacefully, and as they burned fires for your ancestors, the former kings who were before you, so they'll burn fires for you, wailing, "Oh how terrible, your majesty!"' For I've spoken the word," declares the Lord.4
24Jr 34:6 Then Jeremiah the prophet spoke all of this in Jerusalem to Zedekiah king of Judah,
24Jr 34:7 while the army of the king of Babylon was fighting against Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah that were left, namely Lachish and Azekah. (They were the only fortified cities that remained among the cities of Judah.)
24Jr 34:8 This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Zedekiah had made a covenant with all the people in Jerusalem proclaiming release for them.
24Jr 34:9 Each person was to set free his male and female slaves who were Hebrews, so that no Jewish person would enslave his brother.
24Jr 34:10 All the officials and all the people who had entered into the covenant agreed that each would set his male and female slaves free so that they would not enslave them any longer. They obeyed and they released them.
24Jr 34:11 But afterward they turned around and took back the male and female slaves that they had set free, and they forced them to become male and female slaves.
24Jr 34:12 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah from the Lord£º 
24Jr 34:13 "This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'I made a covenant with your ancestors on the day I brought them out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. I told them£º 
24Jr 34:14 "At the end of seven years, each of you is to set free your fellow Hebrew who has sold himself to you and has served you for six years. You are to send him out from you with no further obligation." But your ancestors didn't obey me or pay attention.
24Jr 34:15 You recently repented and did what was right in my eyes by proclaiming release for one another, and you made a covenant before me in the house that is called by my name.
24Jr 34:16 But then you turned around and profaned my name when each of you took back his male and female slaves whom you had set free according to their desire, and you forced them to become male and female slaves."'
24Jr 34:17 "Therefore, this is what the Lord says£º 'You haven't obeyed me by each of you proclaiming a release for your brothers and neighbors. Now I'm going to proclaim a release for you,' declares the Lord, 'a release to the sword, to plague, and to famine, and I'll make you a horrifying sight to all the kingdoms of the earth.
24Jr 34:18 I'll give over the men who transgressed my covenant, who haven't fulfilled the terms of the covenant that they made before me when they cut the calf in two and passed between its parts - 
24Jr 34:19 the officials of Judah, the officials of Jerusalem, the eunuchs, the priests, and all the people of the land who passed between the parts of the calf.
24Jr 34:20 I'll give them to their enemies who are seeking to kill them, and their dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the animals of the land.
24Jr 34:21 I'll give Zedekiah, king of Judah, and his officials into the domination of their enemies, to those who are seeking to kill them, and to the army of the king of Babylon that is coming against them.
24Jr 34:22 Look, I'm in command of them, declares the Lord, and I'll bring them back to this city. They'll capture it and burn it with fire, and I'll turn the towns of Judah into desolate places without inhabitants.'"
24Jr 35:1 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord during the reign of Josiah's son Jehoiakim, king of Judah:
24Jr 35:2 "Go to the house of the Rechabites and speak to them. Bring them into the LORD's temple, to one of the offices, and offer them wine to drink.
24Jr 35:3 So I took Jeremiah's son Jaazaniah (a descendant of Habazziniah), his brothers, all his sons, and the whole family of the Rechabites.
24Jr 35:4 I brought them to the LORD's temple to the office of the descendants of Igdaliah's son Hanan, the man of God, which was next to the office of the officials, and which was above the office of Shallum's son Maaseiah, the keeper of the threshold.3
24Jr 35:5 I put containers full of wine and cups in front of the members of the Rechabite clan and told them, "Drink the wine!"
24Jr 35:6 But they said, "We won't drink wine, because our ancestor, Rechab's son Jonadab commanded us£º 'You and your descendants are never to drink wine!
24Jr 35:7 You aren't to build houses, you aren't to sow seeds, you aren't to plant vineyards, or own them. Instead, you are to live in tents all your lives, so you will enjoy a long life in the land where you reside.'
24Jr 35:8 We have obeyed everything that our ancestor, Rechab's son Jonadab, commanded us. So we, our wives, our sons, and our daughters have drunk no wine all our lives,
24Jr 35:9 and have built no houses to live in. We don't have vineyards, fields, or seed.
24Jr 35:10 We have lived in tents. We have obeyed and have done everything that our ancestor Jonadab commanded us.
24Jr 35:11 Now when Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up against the land, we said, 'Come on! Let's go to Jerusalem because of the army of the Chaldeans and the army of Aram. And now we're living in Jerusalem.'"35
24Jr 35:12 The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah£º 
24Jr 35:13 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel says£º 'Go and say to the people of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, "Will you not accept correction by listening to what I say? declares the Lord.
24Jr 35:14 "But what Rechab's son Jonadab commanded his sons about not drinking wine is observed, and they haven't drunk wine until this day. Indeed, they obey the commands of their ancestor. But I've spoken to you again and again, and you haven't obeyed me.
24Jr 35:15 I've sent you all my servants, the prophets, sending them again and again. I've said, 'Each of you turn from his evil way and make your deeds right. Don't follow other gods to serve them. Then you will remain in the land that I gave to you and to your ancestors. But you haven't paid attention and you haven't obeyed me.
24Jr 35:16 Indeed the descendants of Rechab's son Jonadab have carried out the command of their ancestor that he gave them, but this people has not obeyed me.
24Jr 35:17 Therefore, this is what the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel says£º 'Look, I'm bringing on Judah and all the residents of Jerusalem all the disaster that I pronounced against them, because I spoke to them, but they didn't listen, and I called out to them, but they didn't answer.'"
24Jr 35:18 Then Jeremiah said to the house of the Rechabites, "This is what the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel says£º 'Because you obeyed the commandment of your ancestor Jonadab, have observed all his commandments, and have done everything that he commanded you,'
24Jr 35:19 therefore, this is what the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel says£º 'Rechab's son Jonadab won't lack a descendant who serves me always."'"
24Jr 36:1 In the fourth year of the reign of Josiah's son King Jehoiakim of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord£º 
24Jr 36:2 "Take a scroll and write on it all the words that I've spoken to you about Israel, about Judah, and about all the nations, since I first spoke to you in the time of Josiah until the present time.
24Jr 36:3 Perhaps the house of Judah will hear about all the calamity that I'm planning to bring on them, and so each of them will turn from his wicked way and I'll forgive their iniquities and sins."
24Jr 36:4 Jeremiah summoned Neriah's son Baruch and at Jeremiah's dictation, Baruch wrote on the scroll all the words of the Lord that he had spoken to him.
24Jr 36:5 Jeremiah instructed Baruch, "I'm confined and can't go to the LORD's temple.
24Jr 36:6 You go and read the words of the Lord that you wrote at my dictation from the scroll. Read them to the people at the LORD's temple on the fast day. Also read them to all the people of Judah who are coming from their towns.
24Jr 36:7 Perhaps their pleas for help will come to the Lord's attention, and each of them will turn from his evil lifestyle in light of the great anger and wrath that the Lord has declared against this people."
24Jr 36:8 So Neriah's son Baruch did just as Jeremiah the prophet instructed him, reading the words of the Lord from the scroll at the LORD's temple.
24Jr 36:9 In the ninth month of the fifth year of the reign of Josiah's son Jehoiakim, king of Judah, a fast was proclaimed in the Lord's presence in Jerusalem for all the people of Jerusalem, as well as all the people who were coming from the towns of Judah.
24Jr 36:10 Baruch read the words of Jeremiah from the scroll to all the people at the LORD's temple. He did this from the office of Shaphan's son Gemariah the scribe, in the upper court at the entrance of the New Gate of the LORD's temple.
24Jr 36:11 When Gemariah's son Micaiah, the grandson of Shaphan, heard all the words of the Lord from the scroll,
24Jr 36:12 he went down to the palace, to the scribe's office, where all the officials were sitting. Elishama the scribe, Shemaiah's son Delaiah, Achor's son Elnathan, Shaphan's son Gemariah, Hananiah's son Zedekiah, and all the other officials were there.
24Jr 36:13 Micaiah told them all the things that he had heard when Baruch read from the scroll to the people.
24Jr 36:14 Then all the officials sent Nethaniah's son Jehudi, (who was also the grandson of Shelemiah and Cushi's great-grandson), to Baruch, who said, "Take the scroll that you read to the people and come." Neriah's son Baruch took the scroll with him and went to them.13
24Jr 36:15 They said to him, "Please sit down and read it to us." So Baruch read it to them.
24Jr 36:16 When they heard all the words, they turned to one another in fear, saying to Baruch, "We must report all these things to the king."
24Jr 36:17 Then they asked Baruch, "Please tell us how you wrote all the words. Did Jeremiah dictate them all?
24Jr 36:18 Baruch answered them, "Yes, Jeremiah dictated all these words to me, and I wrote them in the scroll with ink."
24Jr 36:19 Then the officials said to Baruch, "Go, hide yourself, both you and Jeremiah, and don't let anyone know where you are."
24Jr 36:20 The officials went to the king in the courtyard, but they deposited the scroll in the office of Elishama the scribe. Then they reported everything written on the scroll to the king.
24Jr 36:21 The king sent Jehudi to get the scroll, and he took it from the office of Elishama the scribe. Jehudi read it to the king and to all the officials who were standing beside the king.
24Jr 36:22 The king was sitting in the winter palace in the ninth month and a stove was burning in front of him.
24Jr 36:23 As Jehudi would read three or four columns, the king would cut it with a scribe's knife and throw it into the fire which was in the stove, until all the scroll was burned in the fire in the stove.
24Jr 36:24 The king and all his officials who were listening to these words were not afraid, nor did they tear their garments.
24Jr 36:25 Even though Elnathan, Delaiah, and Gemariah urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them.
24Jr 36:26 The king ordered his son Jerahmeel, Azriel's son Seraiah, and Abdiel's son Shelemiah to get Baruch the scribe and Jeremiah the prophet, but the Lord had hidden them.
24Jr 36:27 The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah after the king burned the scroll containing the words that Baruch had written at Jeremiah's dictation£º 
24Jr 36:28 "Go back, take another scroll and write on it all the original words which were on the scroll that Jehoiakim, king of Judah, burned.
24Jr 36:29 Concerning Jehoiakim, king of Judah, you are to say, 'This is what the Lord says£º "You burned this scroll, all the while saying, 'Why did you write on it that the king of Babylon will definitely come, destroy this land, and eliminate both people and animals from it?"
24Jr 36:30 Therefore, this is what the Lord says concerning Jehoiakim king of Judah, 'He will have no one to sit on the throne of David, and his corpse will be thrown out to rot during the heat of the day and the frost of the night.
24Jr 36:31 I'll punish him, his descendants, and his officials for their iniquity. I'll bring on them, on the residents of Jerusalem, and on the men of Judah all the calamity about which I've warned them, but they would not listen.'"3630
24Jr 36:32 Then Jeremiah took another scroll and gave it to Neriah's son Baruch the scribe. He wrote on it, at Jeremiah's dictation, all the words of the book that Jehoiakim king of Judah burned in the fire. He also added to them many similar words.
24Jr 37:1 Josiah's son King Zedekiah reigned in place of Jehoiakim's son Coniah, whom Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had made king of the land of Judah.
24Jr 37:2 But neither he nor his officials nor the people of the land listened to the words of the Lord that were spoken by Jeremiah the prophet.
24Jr 37:3 King Zedekiah sent Shelemiah's son Jehucal and Maaseiah's son Zephaniah the priest to Jeremiah the prophet, asking him, "Please pray to the Lord our God for us."
24Jr 37:4 Now Jeremiah was still going in and out among the people since he had not yet been put in prison.
24Jr 37:5 Pharaoh's army had come out of Egypt, and when the Chaldeans who were besieging Jerusalem heard the report about them, they withdrew from Jerusalem. 
24Jr 37:6 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah the prophet£º 
24Jr 37:7 "This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'This is what you are to say to the king of Judah who sent you to me to inquire of me, "Look, Pharaoh's army that has come to help will go back to its own land of Egypt,
24Jr 37:8 and then the Chaldeans will come back to fight against this city, to capture it, and burn it with fire."'
24Jr 37:9 This is what the Lord says£º "Don't deceive yourselves by saying, 'The Chaldeans will surely go away from us,' for they won't go.
24Jr 37:10 Indeed, even if you defeated the entire Chaldean army that is fighting against you, and they had only wounded men left in their tents, they would get up and burn this city with fire."'"
24Jr 37:11 When the Chaldean army was leaving Jerusalem because of Pharaoh's army,
24Jr 37:12 Jeremiah left Jerusalem to go to the territory of Benjamin to take possession of his property there among the people.
24Jr 37:13 He was in the Gate of Benjamin, and chief officer Irijah, Shelemiah's son and the grandson of Hananiah, was there. He arrested Jeremiah the prophet, accusing him£º "You are going over to the Chaldeans!"
24Jr 37:14 Jeremiah said, "It's a lie! I'm not going over to the Chaldeans." But Irijah would not listen to him, and he arrested Jeremiah and brought him to the officials.
24Jr 37:15 The officials were angry with Jeremiah and beat him. They put him in jail in the house of Jonathan the scribe because they had made it into a prison.
24Jr 37:16 So Jeremiah came into the cells in the dungeon and remained there for a long time.
24Jr 37:17 Then King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah and received him. The king questioned him secretly in his house£º "Is there a word from the Lord? Jeremiah said, "There is," and then he said, "You will be given into the hand of the king of Babylon."
24Jr 37:18 Then Jeremiah asked King Zedekiah, "What offense have I committed against you, your officials, or these people that you have put me in prison - 
24Jr 37:19 Where are your prophets who prophesied to you, telling you£º 'The king of Babylon won't come against you or against this land' - 
24Jr 37:20 Now, please listen, your majesty, and pay attention to what I'm asking you. Don't make me go back to the house of Jonathan the scribe, so I don't die there."
24Jr 37:21 So King Zedekiah gave the order, and they assigned Jeremiah to the courtyard of the guard. Each day they gave him a loaf of bread from the bakers' street until all the bread in the city was gone. So Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
24Jr 38:1 Mattan's son Shephatiah, Pashur's son Gedaliah, Shelemiah's son Jucal, and Malchijah's son Pashhur heard the words that Jeremiah was speaking to all the people:
24Jr 38:2 "This is what the Lord says£º 'Whoever stays in this city will die by the sword, by famine, and by the plague, but the one who goes over to the Chaldeans will live. His life will be spared, and he will live.'
24Jr 38:3 "This is what the Lord says£º 'This city will surely be given to the army of the king of Babylon, and he will capture it.'"
24Jr 38:4 Then the officials said to the king, "Let this man be put to death because he's undermining the efforts of the soldiers who remain in this city and that of all the people by speaking words like these to them. Indeed, this man is not seeking the well-being of this people, but rather their harm."
24Jr 38:5 King Zedekiah said, "Look, he's in your hands, and the king can do nothing to you."
24Jr 38:6 So they threw Jeremiah into a cistern that belonged to the king's son Malchijah and was located in the courtyard of the guard. When they let Jeremiah down with ropes, because there was no water in the cistern - only mud - Jeremiah sank into the mud.
24Jr 38:7 Ebed-melech the Ethiopian, a eunuch in the king's house, heard that Jeremiah had been put in the cistern. The king was sitting in the Benjamin Gate,
24Jr 38:8 so Ebed-melech went out of the palace and spoke to the king£º 
24Jr 38:9 "Your majesty, these men have acted wickedly in all they have done to the prophet Jeremiah by throwing him into the cistern. He will die where he is because of the famine since there is no more bread in the city."
24Jr 38:10 Then the king ordered Ebed-melech the Ethiopian£º "Thirty men are at your disposal. Take them with you and bring up Jeremiah the prophet from the cistern before he dies."
24Jr 38:11 So Ebed-melech took the men with him and went to the palace, underneath the storeroom. He took worn out rags and worn out clothes from there, and using ropes he lowered them down to Jeremiah in the cistern.
24Jr 38:12 Ebed-melech the Ethiopian said to Jeremiah, "Put the worn out rags and clothes under your armpits under the ropes," and Jeremiah did as he said.
24Jr 38:13 They pulled Jeremiah with the ropes and brought him up from the cistern, but Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard.
24Jr 38:14 King Zedekiah sent for Jeremiah the prophet and had him brought to him at the third entrance to the LORD's temple. The king said to Jeremiah, "I'm going to ask you something, and don't hide anything from me."
24Jr 38:15 Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "When I tell you, you will surely put me to death, won't you?And when I give you advice, you don't listen to me."
24Jr 38:16 Then King Zedekiah, in secret, swore an oath to Jeremiah£º "As surely as the Lord lives, who gave us this life to live, I won't have you put to death, nor will I hand you over to these men who are seeking to kill you."
24Jr 38:17 So Jeremiah said to Zedekiah, "This is what the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º 'If you will immediately surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then you will live, and this city won't be burned with fire. Both you and your family will live.
24Jr 38:18 But if you don't surrender to the officers of the king of Babylon, then this city will be given to the Chaldeans, and they'll burn it with fire. You won't escape from their hands.'"
24Jr 38:19 Then King Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "I'm afraid of the Judeans who have gone over to the Chaldeans. The Chaldeans may turn me over to them, and they may treat me harshly."
24Jr 38:20 Jeremiah said, "They won't turn you over. Obey the Lord in what I'm telling you, and it will go well for you and you will live.
24Jr 38:21 But if you refuse to surrender, this is what the Lord has shown me£º 
24Jr 38:22 Look, all the women who are left in the house of the king of Judah will be brought out to the officers of the king of Babylon, and will say, 'These friends of yours have mislead you and overcome you. Your feet have sunk down into the mire, but they have turned away.'
24Jr 38:23 "They'll bring all your women and children out to the Chaldeans, and you won't escape from their hand. Indeed, you will be seized by the hand of the king of Babylon, and this city will be burned with fire."
24Jr 38:24 Then Zedekiah said to Jeremiah, "Don't let anyone know about these words and you won't die.
24Jr 38:25 If the officials hear that I've spoken with you, and they come to you and say, 'Tell us what you said to the king, and what the king said to you; don't hide it from us, and we won't put you to death,'
24Jr 38:26 then you are to say to them, 'I was presenting my request to the king that I not be taken back to the house of Jonathan to die there.'"
24Jr 38:27 When all the officials came to Jeremiah and questioned him, he replied to them exactly as the king had ordered him. So they stopped speaking with him because the conversation had not been overheard.
24Jr 38:28 Jeremiah remained in the courtyard of the guard until the day Jerusalem was captured.
24Jr 39:1 This is how Jerusalem was captured£º In the tenth month of the ninth year of the reign of Zedekiah king of Judah, Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon and all his army came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it.
24Jr 39:2 On the ninth day of the fourth month, in the eleventh year of the reign of Zedekiah, the wall of the city was breached.
24Jr 39:3 All the officials of the king of Babylon came and sat in the Middle Gate, including Nergal-sarri-usur, governor of Sinmagir, Nabu-sarrussu-ukin the high official, Nergal-sarri-user, the chief official, and all the rest of the officials of the king of Babylon.
24Jr 39:4 When Zedekiah king of Judah and all the soldiers saw them, they fled and went out of the city at night by way of the king's garden through the gate between the two walls. Then he went out on the road toward the Arabah.
24Jr 39:5 The Chaldean army pursued them and overtook Zedekiah on the plains of Jericho. When they seized him they brought him to Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, and he passed judgment on him.
24Jr 39:6 At Riblah, the king of Babylon executed Zedekiah's sons right before his eyes. He also executed all the nobles of Judah.
24Jr 39:7 Then he put out Zedekiah's eyes and bound him with bronze fetters to take him to Babylon.
24Jr 39:8 The Chaldeans burned the palace and the houses of the people with fire, and they broke down the walls of Jerusalem.
24Jr 39:9 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the Babylonian guard, took into exile in Babylon the rest of the people who remained in the city, those who had deserted to Nebuchadnezzar, and the rest of the people who remained.
24Jr 39:10 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard left in the land of Judah some of the poor people who did not have anything, and he gave them vineyards and fields on that day.
24Jr 39:11 Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon gave orders concerning Jeremiah through Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard£º 
24Jr 39:12 "Take him, look after him, and don't do anything to harm him. Rather, do for him whatever he tells you."
24Jr 39:13 So Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, Nebushazban, the high official, Nergal-sar-ezer, the chief official, and all the officials of the king of Babylon sent for Jeremiah.
24Jr 39:14 They sent for Jeremiah and took him from the courtyard of the guard. They handed him over to Ahikam's son Gedaliah, the grandson of Shaphan, to take him home. So he remained among the people.
24Jr 39:15 The word of the Lord came to Jeremiah while he was confined in the courtyard of the guard£º 
24Jr 39:16 "Go and speak to Ebed-melech the Ethiopian£º 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "Look, I'm going to fulfill my promise against this city for disaster rather than for good, and on that day it will happen before your eyes.
24Jr 39:17 But I'll deliver you on that day," declares the Lord. "You won't be given into the hands of the men you fear.
24Jr 39:18 For I'll surely deliver you, and you won't fall by the sword. Your life will be spared because you trusted me," declares the Lord.'"3917
24Jr 40:1 This is the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord after Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had released him from Ramah, when he was bound in chains, along with all the exiles from Jerusalem and Judah who were being taken into exile in Babylon.
24Jr 40:2 The captain of the guard took Jeremiah and said to him, "The Lord your God has predicted this disaster on this place.
24Jr 40:3 And now the Lord has brought it about and has done just as he said. Because you people sinned against the Lord and didn't obey him, this has happened to you.
24Jr 40:4 Now, look, I've freed you today from the chains that were on your hands. If you want to come with me to Babylon, come, and I'll look after you. But if you don't want to come with me to Babylon, don't. Look, the whole land lies before you, so go wherever it seems good and right for you to go."
24Jr 40:5 When he still did not respond, Nebuzaradan said, "Return to Ahikam's son Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylon has appointed over the cities of Judah, and remain with him among the people - or go wherever it seems right for you to go." Then the captain of the guard gave him an allowance of food and a gift and sent him off.
24Jr 40:6 Jeremiah came to Ahikam's son Gedaliah at Mizpah, and he remained with him among the people who were left in the land.
24Jr 40:7 All the leaders of the forces who were in the field along with their men heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Ahikam's son Gedaliah over the men, women, children, and the poor of the land who had not been taken into exile in Babylon.
24Jr 40:8 Those who came to Gedaliah at Mizpah included Nethaniah's son Ishmael, Jonathan, Kareah's son Jonathan, Tanhumeth's son Seriah, Ephai's sons from Netopath; and Jezaniah, the son of a man from Maacah. They came along with their men.
24Jr 40:9 Ahikam's son Gedaliah, the grandson of Shaphan, swore an oath to them and their men£º "Don't be afraid to serve the Chaldeans. Remain in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and things will go well for you.
24Jr 40:10 As for me, I'll remain at Mizpah to represent you before the Chaldeans who come to us. As for you, gather wine, summer fruit, and oil. Put it in your containers and live in your cities that you have taken over."
24Jr 40:11 All the Judeans who were in Moab, those with the people in Ammon, those in Edom, and those in all the other countries also heard that the king of Babylon had left a remnant for Judah and that he had appointed Ahikam's son Gedaliah, the grandson of Shaphan, over them.
24Jr 40:12 So all the Judeans returned from all the countries where they had been scattered. They came to the land of Judah, to Gedaliah at Mizpah, and they gathered wine and summer fruit in great abundance.4011
24Jr 40:13 Kareah's son Jonathan and all leaders of the forces who were in the field came to Gedaliah at Mizpah.
24Jr 40:14 They said to him, "Are you aware that Baalis, the king of the people of Ammon, has sent Nethaniah's son Ishmael to take your life? But Ahikam's son Gedaliah did not believe them.
24Jr 40:15 Then Kareah's son Jonathan spoke privately to Gedaliah at Mizpah£º "Let me go kill Nethaniah's son Ishmael, and no one will know. Why should he take your life?Otherwise all the Judeans who have gathered around you will be scattered, and the remnant of Judah will perish."
24Jr 40:16 Ahikam's son Gedaliah replied to Kareah's son Jonathan, "Don't do this! You're lying about Ishmael!"
24Jr 41:1 In the seventh month, Nethaniah's son Ishmael, the grandson of Elishama, a member of the royal family and one of the chief officers of the king, came to Ahikam's son Gedaliah at Mizpah, along with ten men. While they were dining together there at Mizpah,
24Jr 41:2 Nethaniah's son Ishmael and the ten men with him got up and killed Ahikam's son Gedaliah, the grandson of Shaphan, with swords and killed the man whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
24Jr 41:3 Ishmael also struck down all the Judeans who were with him (that is, with Gedaliah) at Mizpah, along with the Chaldean soldiers who were found there.1
24Jr 41:4 Now on the day after Gedaliah was killed, when as yet no one knew about it,
24Jr 41:5 eighty men from Shechem, from Shiloh, and from Samaria came with their beards shaved, their clothes torn, and their bodies slashed. They had grain offerings and incense with them to present at the LORD's temple.
24Jr 41:6 Nethaniah's son Ishmael went out from Mizpah to meet them, crying as he went. As he met them he said to them, "Come meet with Ahikam's son Gedaliah."
24Jr 41:7 When they reached the middle of the city, Nethaniah's son Ishmael and the men who were with him slaughtered them and threw them into a cistern.
24Jr 41:8 Ten men who were among them said to Ishmael, "Don't kill us because we have stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey hidden in the field. So Ishmael stopped and did not kill them or their companions.
24Jr 41:9 Ishmael threw the bodies of the men he killed on account of Gedaliah into the cistern that King Asa had made for protection against King Baasha of Israel. That is the same one Nethaniah's son Ishmael filled with those he killed.
24Jr 41:10 Then Ishmael took captive all the rest of the people who were in Mizpah, including the king's daughters and all the rest of the people in Mizpah over whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had appointed Ahikam's son Gedaliah. Nethaniah's son Ishmael took them captive and then set out to cross over to the Ammonites.419
24Jr 41:11 Kareah's son Jonathan and all the military leaders who were with him heard about all the terrible things that Nethaniah's son Ishmael had done.
24Jr 41:12 So they took all the men and went to fight Nethaniah's son Ishmael, and they found him at the large pool that is at Gibeon.
24Jr 41:13 When all the people who were with Ishmael saw Kareah's son Jonathan and all the military leaders who were with him, they were glad.
24Jr 41:14 All the people whom Ishmael had taken captive from Mizpah turned around and went back to Kareah's son Jonathan.
24Jr 41:15 But Nethaniah's son Ishmael and eight other men escaped from Jonathan and went to the Ammonites.
24Jr 41:16 Kareah's son Jonathan and all the military leaders who were with him took all the rest of the people from Mizpah whom he had rescued from Nethaniah's son Ishmael after he had killed Ahikam's son Gedaliah, including the young men, the soldiers, women, children, and eunuchs whom he had rescued from Gibeon.
24Jr 41:17 They traveled and then stopped at Geruth Chimham near Bethlehem on their way to Egypt
24Jr 41:18 because of the Chaldeans. They were afraid of the Chaldeans because Nethaniah's son Ishmael had killed Ahikam's son Gedaliah, whom the king of Babylon had appointed over the land.
24Jr 42:1 Then all the military leaders, Kereah's son Jonathan, Hoshaiah's son Jezaniah, and all the people from the least to the greatest approached Jeremiah.
24Jr 42:2 They said to Jeremiah the prophet, "Please listen to what we have to ask of you. Pray to the Lord your God for us and for all these survivors. Indeed, only a few of us remain out of many, as you can see.
24Jr 42:3 Pray that the Lord your God may inform us as to how we should live and what we should do."
24Jr 42:4 Jeremiah the prophet said to them, "I've heard, and I'm going to pray to the Lord your God just as you have requested. Whatever the Lord answers, I'll tell you. I won't withhold anything from you."
24Jr 42:5 Then they said to Jeremiah, "May the Lord be a true and faithful witness against us if we don't do everything that the Lord your God tells us through you.
24Jr 42:6 Whether it seems good or bad, we will obey the Lord our God to whom we send you, so it may go well for us. Indeed, we will obey the Lord our God."
24Jr 42:7 At the end of ten days the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah.
24Jr 42:8 So he called Kareah's son Jonathan, all the military leaders who were with him, and all the people from the least to the greatest.
24Jr 42:9 He said to them, "This is what the Lord God of Israel says, to whom you sent me to take your request£º 
24Jr 42:10 'If you will just remain in this land, I'll build you up and not pull you down. I'll plant you and not uproot you, for I'm sorry about the disaster I've brought on you.
24Jr 42:11 Don't be afraid of the king of Babylon as you have been. Don't fear him,' declares the Lord, 'because I am with you to save you and deliver you from his control.
24Jr 42:12 I'll show you compassion, so he will have compassion on you and return you to your land.
24Jr 42:13 But if you disobey the Lord your God by saying, "We won't stay in this land,"
24Jr 42:14 and you also say, "No, but we will go to the land of Egypt where we won't see war or hear the sound of the trumpet or hunger for bread, and there we will stay,"
24Jr 42:15 then hear the word of the Lord, remnant of Judah. This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "If you are really determined to go into Egypt, and you go there to settle,
24Jr 42:16 the sword that you fear will overtake you there in the land of Egypt. The famine that you dread will pursue you into Egypt, and there you will die.
24Jr 42:17 All the people who are determined to go into Egypt to settle there will die by the sword, by famine, and by the plague. No one will survive the disaster that I'll bring on them."
24Jr 42:18 For this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º 'Just as my anger and my wrath were poured out on the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so my wrath will be poured out on you when you enter Egypt. You will be a curse and an object of horror, ridicule, and scorn, and you will never again see this place.'
24Jr 42:19 The Lord has told you, remnant of Judah, 'Don't go to Egypt!' So be fully aware that I've warned you, today,
24Jr 42:20 that you have deceived yourselves. Indeed, you yourselves sent me to the Lord your God, saying 'Pray to the Lord your God for us, and whatever the Lord our God tells us we will do.'
24Jr 42:21 I've told you today, but you haven't obeyed the Lord your God in all that he sent me to tell you.
24Jr 42:22 Now, be fully aware that you will die by the sword, by famine, and by plague in the place where you want to settle."
24Jr 43:1 When Jeremiah had finished telling all the people all the words that the Lord their God had sent him to tell them?that is, all these words - 
24Jr 43:2 Hoshaiah's son Azariah, Kareah's son Johanan, and all the arrogant men said to Jeremiah, "You're lying! The Lord our God didn't send you to say, 'Don't go to Egypt to settle there.'
24Jr 43:3 Indeed, Neriah's son Baruch is inciting you against us in order to give us into the hands of the Chaldeans, to kill us, or to take us into exile to Babylon.
24Jr 43:4 So Kareah's son Johanan, all the military leaders, and all the people did not obey the instructions given by the Lord to remain in the land of Judah.
24Jr 43:5 Kareah's son Johanan and all the military leaders took the entire remnant of Judah that had returned from all the nations where they had been scattered to settle in the land of Judah - 6the young men, the women, the children, the daughters of the king, and everyone whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard had left with Ahikam's son Gedaliah, the grandson of Shaphan, along with Jeremiah the prophet and Neriah's son Baruch.
24Jr 43:7 So they went into the land of Egypt, because they did not obey the Lord, and they travelled as far as Tahpanhes.
24Jr 43:8 Then the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah in Tahpanhes£º 
24Jr 43:9 "Take large stones in your hands, and, in the sight of the men of Judah, bury them in the mortar of the brickwork at the entrance of Pharaoh's house in Tahpanhes.
24Jr 43:10 Then say to them, 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "I'm going to send for my servant Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. I'll take him and set his throne over these stones that I've buried, and he will spread his canopy over them.
24Jr 43:11 He will come and attack the land of Egypt - those meant for death will be put to death, those meant for captivity will be taken captive, and those meant for the sword will be put to the sword.
24Jr 43:12 He will set fire to the temples of the gods of Egypt. He will burn their idols and take them captive. He will wrap himself with the land of Egypt like a shepherd wraps himself with a garment, and then he will leave from there in peace.
24Jr 43:13 He will shatter the pillars of Heliopolis in the land of Egypt and will burn the temples of the gods of Egypt with fire."'"
24Jr 44:1 This is the word that came to Jeremiah for all the Judeans who were living in the land of Egypt, who were living in Migdol, Tahpanhes, Memphis, and in the land of Pathros, saying,
24Jr 44:2 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º 'You have seen the disaster that I brought on Jerusalem and all the cities of Judah. Look, they're in ruins today, with no one living in them,
24Jr 44:3 because of the wickedness that they did, provoking me to anger by continuing to offer sacrifices and worship other gods that neither they nor you nor your ancestors had known.
24Jr 44:4 Yet I sent all my servants the prophets to you again and again, saying, "Don't do this repulsive thing that I hate."
24Jr 44:5 But they didn't listen or pay attention by turning from their wickedness and not offering sacrifices to other gods.
24Jr 44:6 My wrath and my anger were poured out, and they burned in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem so that they have become a ruin and a desolate place, as is the case today
24Jr 44:7 'Now, this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "Why are you doing great harm to yourselves so as to cut off from Judah, man and woman, child and infant from you, leaving yourselves without a remnant - 
24Jr 44:8 And why have you provoked me to anger by the works of your hands, by offering sacrifices to other gods in the land of Egypt where you have come to settle so that you cut yourselves off and become an object of ridicule and scorn among all the nations of the earth - 
24Jr 44:9 Have you forgotten the evil deeds of your ancestors, the evil deeds of the kings of Judah, the evil deeds of their wives, your evil deeds, and the evil deeds of your wives, that they did in the land of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem - 
24Jr 44:10 To this day they haven't humbled themselves, they haven't shown reverence for the Lord, and they haven't lived according to my Law and my statutes that I set before them and before their ancestors."'9
24Jr 44:11 Therefore, this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "Look, I've determined to bring disaster on you and to cut off all Judah.
24Jr 44:12 I'll take the remnant of Judah that determined to go to the land of Egypt to settle there, and all of them will come to an end in the land of Egypt. They'll fall by the sword, and they'll come to an end by famine. They'll become a curse, an object of horror, ridicule, and scorn.
24Jr 44:13 I'll punish those who live in the land of Egypt just as I punished Jerusalem?with the sword, with famine, and with plague.
24Jr 44:14 Of the remnant of Judah that came into the land of Egypt to settle there, no one will escape or survive to return to the land of Judah where they long to return and live. Indeed, they won't return, except for some refugees.
24Jr 44:15 Then all the men who knew that their wives were offering sacrifices to other gods and all the women who were standing by - a large group, including all the people who were living in the land of Egypt in Pathros - answered Jeremiah£º 
24Jr 44:16 "As for the message that you reported to us in the name of the Lord, we won't listen to you!
24Jr 44:17 Rather, we will keep doing everything that we said we would by offering sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and by pouring out liquid offerings to her just as we, our ancestors, our kings, and our leaders did in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem. Then we had plenty of bread, things went well for us, and we didn't experience disaster.
24Jr 44:18 From the time we stopped offering sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out liquid offerings to her, we have lacked everything, and we have been consumed by the sword and famine.
24Jr 44:19 Indeed, we are going to continue offering sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pouring out liquid offerings to her. And do you think we have made cakes to represent her or poured out liquid offerings for her without our husbands' approval?
24Jr 44:20 Then Jeremiah spoke a word to all the people, to the young men, to the women, and to all the people who were answering him£º 
24Jr 44:21 "As for the sacrifices that you, your ancestors, your kings, your officials, and the people of the land offered in the cities of Judah and the streets of Jerusalem, the Lord remembered them, did he not?And they came to his attention, did they not - 
24Jr 44:22 The Lord could no longer bear it because of your evil deeds and the repulsive things that you did. So your land has become a ruin and an object of horror and ridicule without an inhabitant, as is the case today.
24Jr 44:23 Because you offered sacrifices and sinned against the Lord, you didn't obey the Lord and didn't live according to his Law, his statutes, or his testimonies; therefore, this disaster has happened to you, as is the case today."
24Jr 44:24 Then Jeremiah said to all the people and all the women, "All you people of Judah who are in the land of Egypt, listen to the word of the Lord!
24Jr 44:25 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º 'You and your wives have spoken with your mouths and acted with your hands£º "We will certainly carry through on the vows that we vowed to offer sacrifices to the Queen of Heaven and pour out liquid offerings to her!" Go ahead, carry through on your vows, and diligently do what you vowed!'
24Jr 44:26 But listen to the word of the Lord, all you people of Judah who are living in the land of Egypt. 'Look, I've sworn by my great name', says the Lord, 'my name will no longer be invoked by the mouth of any person in the entire land of Egypt, as he says, "As surely as the Lord God lives¡¦"
24Jr 44:27 'Look, I'm watching over them to bring disaster rather than good. Every person of Judah in the land of Egypt will be brought to an end by the sword and by famine until they're completely gone.
24Jr 44:28 The ones who escape the sword will return from the land of Egypt to the land of Judah, few in number. Then all the remnant of Judah who have come into the land of Egypt to settle will know whose word will stand, mine or theirs.
24Jr 44:29 This will be a sign to you,' declares the Lord, 'that I'll punish you in this place so that you may know that my words concerning disaster against you will surely stand.'
24Jr 44:30 This is what the Lord says£º 'Look, I'm going to give Pharaoh Hophra king of Egypt into the hands of his enemies and into the hands of those seeking his life, just as I gave Zedekiah king of Judah into the hands of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, his enemy who was seeking his life.
24Jr 45:1 This is the word that Jeremiah the prophet spoke to Neriah's son Baruch, when in the fourth year of the reign of Josiah's son King Jehoiakim of Judah had, at Jeremiah's dictation, written these words in a scroll£º 
24Jr 45:2 "This is what the Lord God of Israel says to you, Baruch£º 
24Jr 45:3 'You have said, "How terrible for me, for the Lord has added sorrow to my pain. I'm weary with my groaning, and I haven't found rest."'
24Jr 45:4 Say this to him£º 'This is what the Lord says£º "Look! What I've built I'm about to tear down, and what I've planted I'm about to pull up?and this will involve the entire land."
24Jr 45:5 Are you seeking great things for yourself?Don't seek them. Indeed, I'm about to bring disaster on all flesh,' declares the Lord, 'but your life will be spared wherever you go.'"
24Jr 46:1 This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the nations.
24Jr 46:2 To Egypt£º Concerning the army of Pharaoh Neco king of Egypt, which was by the Euphrates River at Carchemish and which King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon defeated in the fourth year of the reign of Josiah's son Jehoiakim, king of Judah.
24Jr 46:3 "Prepare buckler and shield, and advance into the battle!
24Jr 46:4 Harness the horses! Riders, mount up! Take your positions with your helmets! Polish lances, and put on armor!
24Jr 46:5 Why am I seeing this?They're terrified, they have turned back. Their warriors are crushed, and they take flight. They don't look back. Terror is on every side," declares the Lord.
24Jr 46:6 "The swift cannot flee, nor can the strong escape. In the north, beside the Euphrates River, they stumble and fall.
24Jr 46:7 Who is this rising like the Nile, like rivers whose waters surge - 
24Jr 46:8 Egypt is rising like the Nile, like rivers whose waters surge. He says, 'I'll rise and cover the land. I'll destroy city and its inhabitants.'
24Jr 46:9 Horses, get up! Chariots, drive furiously! Let the warriors go forward, Ethiopia and Put who carry shields, and the Lydians who handle and bend the bow.
24Jr 46:10 That day belongs to the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. It is a day of vengeance to take vengeance on his foes. The sword will devour and be satisfied, and will drink its fill of their blood. For the Lord GOD of the Heavenly Armies will hold a sacrifice in the land of the north, by the Euphrates river.
24Jr 46:11 Go up to Gilead and get balm, virgin daughter of Egypt! In vain you multiply remedies, but there is no healing for you.
24Jr 46:12 The nations have heard of your disgrace, and your cry of distress fills the earth. Indeed, one warrior stumbles over another, and both of them fall down together."
24Jr 46:13 This is the message that the Lord spoke to Jeremiah the prophet about the coming of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon to conquer the land of Egypt.
24Jr 46:14 "Announce in Egypt, proclaim in Migdol. Proclaim also in Memphis and Tahpanhes. Say, 'Take your positions and be ready, for the sword will devour all around you.'
24Jr 46:15 Why are your warriors prostrate?They don't stand because the Lord has brought them down.
24Jr 46:16 They repeatedly stumble and fall. They say to each other, 'Get up! Let's go back to our people and to the land of our birth, away from the oppressor's sword.'
24Jr 46:17 There they'll cry out, 'Pharaoh king of Egypt is just a big noise. He has let the appointed time pass by.'
24Jr 46:18 As certainly as I'm alive and living," declares the King, whose name is the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. Indeed, one will come like Tabor among the mountains and like Carmel by the sea.
24Jr 46:19 Prepare your baggage for exile, daughter living in Egypt, for Memphis will become a desolate place. It will become a ruin without inhabitant.
24Jr 46:20 Egypt is a beautiful calf, but a horsefly from the north is surely coming.
24Jr 46:21 Even the mercenary troops in her ranks are like a fattened calf. They too will turn around, and will flee together. They won't stand, for the day of their disaster is coming on them, the time of their punishment.
24Jr 46:22 Her cry will be like that of a fleeing serpent when they come in strength. They're coming to her with axes like woodcutters.
24Jr 46:23 They'll cut down her forest, though it's impenetrable," declares the Lord, "for they're more numerous than locusts, and there are too many of them to count.
24Jr 46:24 The daughter of Egypt will be put to shame, she will be given into the hands of the people from the north."
24Jr 46:25 The Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel says, "Look, I'm going to punish Amon of Thebes, Pharaoh, Egypt, its gods and its kings, Pharaoh, and those who trust in him.
24Jr 46:26 I'll give them to those who are seeking their lives and to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon and his officers. Then afterwards, Egypt will be inhabited as in times past," declares the Lord.
24Jr 46:27 "As for you, my servant Jacob, don't be afraid, and Israel, don't be dismayed. For I'll deliver you from a distant place, and your descendants from the land of their captivity. Jacob will return. He will be undisturbed and secure, and no one will cause him to fear.
24Jr 46:28 "As for you, my servant Jacob, don't be afraid, and Israel, don't be dismayed," declares the Lord, "for I am with you. Indeed, I'll make an end of all the nations where I scattered you; but I won't make an end of you! I'll discipline you justly, but I'll certainly not leave you unpunished."
24Jr 47:1 This is the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah the prophet concerning the Philistines, before Pharaoh conquered Gaza.
24Jr 47:2 This is what the Lord says£º "Look, waters are rising from the north, and they'll become an overflowing river. They'll overflow the land and all that fills it?the city and those that live in it. People will cry out, and all those living in the land will wail.
24Jr 47:3 At the sound of the galloping hooves of his horses, at the rumbling of his chariots, the clatter of his wheels, fathers won't turn back for their children because their hands are weak,
24Jr 47:4 for the day is coming to destroy all the Philistines, to cut off from Tyre and Sidon every helper who remains. For the Lord is destroying the Philistines, the remnant of the coastlands of Caphtor. 
24Jr 47:5 Baldness is coming to Gaza. Ashkelon is silenced. Remnant of their valley, how long will you gash yourself - 
24Jr 47:6 Ah, sword of the Lord, how long before you are quiet?Put yourself into your scabbard, be at rest, be silent!
24Jr 47:7 How can it be quiet, when the Lord has ordered disaster to come to Ashkelon and the seashore?That's where he has assigned it."
24Jr 48:1 To Moab£º This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "How terrible for Nebo, for it's laid waste. Kiriathiam is put to shame, it's captured. The fortress is put to shame, it's shattered.
24Jr 48:2 The pride of Moab is no more. In Heshbon they plotted evil against her£º 'Come and let's eliminate her as a nation.' Madmen will also be silenced, and the sword will pursue you.
24Jr 48:3 The sound of crying will come from Horonaim, devastation and great destruction.
24Jr 48:4 Moab will be destroyed; her little ones will cry out.
24Jr 48:5 Indeed, at the ascent of Luhith people will go up with bitter weeping. At the descent of Horonaim the anguished cries over the destruction will be heard.
24Jr 48:6 Flee, save your lives, and you will be like a wild donkey in the desert.
24Jr 48:7 But, because you trust in your deeds and your riches, you will also be captured. Chemosh will go out into exile, along with his priests and officials.
24Jr 48:8 A destroyer will come to every town and no town will escape. The valley will be ruined and the plateau destroyed." This is what the Lord has said!
24Jr 48:9 Put salt on Moab for she will surely fall. Her towns will become desolate places, without any inhabitants in them.
24Jr 48:10 Cursed is the one who is slack in doing the Lord's work. Cursed is the one who holds back his sword from shedding blood.
24Jr 48:11 Moab has been at ease from his youth. He has been undisturbed like wine on its dregs and not poured from vessel to vessel. He has not gone into exile. Therefore, his flavor has remained, and his aroma has not changed.
24Jr 48:12 "Therefore, look, days are coming," declares the Lord, "when I'll send those who tip over vessels to him, and they'll tip him over. They'll empty his vessels and shatter his jars.
24Jr 48:13 Moab will be ashamed because of Chemosh just as the house of Israel was ashamed because of Bethel, their confidence.
24Jr 48:14 "How can you say, 'We're strong warriors, and soldiers ready for battle' - 
24Jr 48:15 Moab will be destroyed, and the enemy will come up against her cities. Her finest young men will go down to slaughter," declares the King, whose name is the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
24Jr 48:16 Moab's disaster is near at hand, and his calamity is coming very quickly.
24Jr 48:17 Mourn for him, all who live around him, and all who know his name. Say, 'Oh how the mighty rod is broken, the glorious staff. 
24Jr 48:18 Come down from glory, and sit on parched ground, O woman who lives in Dibon, for the destroyer of Moab will come up against you to destroy you. He will destroy your strongholds.
24Jr 48:19 Stand by the road and keep watch, O woman who lives in Aroer. Ask the man who flees and the woman who escapes. Say, 'What happened' - 
24Jr 48:20 Moab will be put to shame, for it will be destroyed. Wail and cry out. Announce by the Arnon that Moab is destroyed.
24Jr 48:21 Judgment has come to the plateau£º to Holon and Jahzah, and against Mephaath,
24Jr 48:22 Dibon, Nebo, and Beth-diblathaim,
24Jr 48:23 against Kiriathaim, Beth-gamul, and Beth-meon,
24Jr 48:24 against Kerioth, Bozrah, and all the towns in the land of Moab, both far and near.
24Jr 48:25 The strength of Moab is cut off, and his arm is broken," declares the Lord.
24Jr 48:26 Make him drunk for he has exalted himself against the Lord. Moab will wallow in his vomit, and he will be the object of mocking.
24Jr 48:27 Wasn't Israel an object of mocking for you?Wasn't he treated like a thief, so that whenever you spoke about him you shook your head in contempt - 
24Jr 48:28 Abandon the cities, and live on the cliffs, you inhabitants of Moab. Be like a dove that builds a nest by the mouth of a cave.
24Jr 48:29 We have heard about Moab's pride?he's very proud?his haughtiness, his arrogance, his insolence, and his conceit.
24Jr 48:30 I know his gall," declares the Lord, "and it's futile; the boasting that they do is futile.
24Jr 48:31 Therefore, I'll wail for Moab, and for the whole of Moab I'll cry out, for the men of Kir-heres I'll moan.
24Jr 48:32 More than the weeping for Jazer, I'll weep for you, vine of Sibmah. Your branches spread out to the sea, and reached as far as the Sea of Jazer. On your summer fruit and grapes the destroyer will fall.
24Jr 48:33 Gladness and rejoicing will be taken away from the fruitful land. From the land of Moab I'll cause the wine in the wine presses to stop flowing. The workers won't tread the grapes with a loud shout. There will be no shout!
24Jr 48:34 "From the cry of Heshbon, to Elealeh, to Jahaz they have lifted up their voice. From Zoar to Horonaim and to Eglath-shelishiyah, even the waters of Nimrim will become a desolate place.
24Jr 48:35 In Moab," declares the Lord, "I'll put an end to the one who offers a burnt offering on the high place and to the one who burns incense to his gods.
24Jr 48:36 Therefore my heart wails for Moab like flutes and my heart wails for the men of Kir-heres like flutes. Therefore they'll lose the abundance they produced.
24Jr 48:37 Indeed every head will be bald and every beard cut short. There will be gashes on all the hands and sackcloth on the loins.
24Jr 48:38 On all the housetops of Moab and in the streets there will be nothing but mourning, for I'll break Moab like a vessel that no one wants," declares the Lord.
24Jr 48:39 "How it will be shattered! How they'll wail! How Moab will turn his back in shame! Moab will be an object of ridicule and terror to all those around him."4836
24Jr 48:40 For this is what the Lord says£º "Look, like an eagle one will fly swiftly and spread his wings against Moab.
24Jr 48:41 The towns will be captured and the strongholds seized. On that day the hearts of the warriors of Moab will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
24Jr 48:42 Moab will be destroyed as a nation because he exalted himself against the Lord.
24Jr 48:43 Terror, pit, and trap will be used against you who live in Moab," declares the Lord.
24Jr 48:44 "The one who flees from the terror will fall into a pit. And the one who comes up out of the pit will be caught in a trap. For I'll bring upon her, that is upon Moab, the time of her punishment," declares the Lord.
24Jr 48:45 "The fugitives will stand without strength in the shadow of Heshbon, for fire will go out from Heshbon and a flame from the middle of Sihon. It will devour the forehead of Moab and the heads of the rebellious people.
24Jr 48:46 How terrible for you, Moab! The people of Chemosh will perish. Indeed, your sons will be taken into captivity, and your daughters as well.
24Jr 48:47 But I'll restore the fortunes of Moab in the latter days," declares the Lord. This concludes the judgment on Moab.
24Jr 49:1 To the people of Ammon£º This is what the Lord says£º "Does Israel have no sons?Does he have no heir?Why then has Milcom taken possession of Gad, and his people settled in its towns - 
24Jr 49:2 Therefore, look, the time is coming," declares the Lord, "when I'll cause a battle cry to be heard in Rabbah of the Ammonites. It will become a desolate mound, and its towns will be burned with fire. Israel will take possession of those who possessed him," says the Lord.
24Jr 49:3 "Wail, Heshbon, because Ai is destroyed. Cry out, daughters of Rabbah, put on sackcloth and lament. Run back and forth inside the walls, for Milcom is going into exile along with his priests and his princes.
24Jr 49:4 Why do you boast in your valleys?Your valley is flowing away, faithless daughter, who trusted in her treasures, saying, 'Who will come against me?
24Jr 49:5 Look, I'm bringing terror on you from all around you," declares the Lord GOD of the Heavenly Armies. "You will be driven out, fleeing recklessly, and there will be no one to gather the fugitives.
24Jr 49:6 But afterwards I'll restore the fortunes of the people of Ammon," declares the Lord.
24Jr 49:7 To Edom£º This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Is there no longer wisdom in Teman?Has counsel perished among the prudent?Is their wisdom gone - 
24Jr 49:8 Flee, turn around! Go to a remote place to stay, residents of Dedan! For I'll bring Esau's disaster on him at the time when I punish him. If the grape harvesters came to you, would they not leave gleanings?If thieves came at night, they would destroy only until they had enough.
24Jr 49:10 But I'll strip Esau bare. I'll uncover his hiding places so he cannot conceal himself. His offspring, his relatives, and his neighbors will be destroyed, and he will no longer exist.
24Jr 49:11 Leave your orphans. I'll keep them alive. Let your widows trust in me."
24Jr 49:12 For this is what the Lord says£º "Look, those who don't deserve to drink the cup will surely drink it, and will you actually go unpunished?You won't go unpunished! You will certainly drink it!
24Jr 49:13 Indeed, I've sworn by myself," declares the Lord, "that Bozrah will become an object of horror and scorn, a waste, and an object of ridicule. All her towns will become perpetual ruins."
24Jr 49:14 I've heard a message from the Lord, and a messenger has been sent among the nations£º "Gather together and come up against her, and rise up to fight.
24Jr 49:15 Indeed, I'll make you the least of the nations, despised among men.
24Jr 49:16 The terror you cause and the pride of your heart have deceived you. You who live in hidden places in the rocks, who hold on to the heights of the hill, although you make your nest high like the eagle, I'll bring you down from there," declares the Lord.
24Jr 49:17 "Edom will become an object of horror. Everyone who passes by her will be horrified and will scoff because of all her wounds.
24Jr 49:18 Just like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah and their neighbors," says the Lord, "no one will live there. No human being will reside in it.
24Jr 49:19 Look, like a lion comes up from the thicket of the Jordan to a pasture that grows year round, so I'll drive them away from her in an instant, and I'll appoint whomever is chosen over her. Indeed, who is like me?Who gives me counsel?Who is the shepherd who will stand against me?
24Jr 49:20 Therefore, hear the plan that the Lord has made against Edom, and the strategy that he devised against the inhabitants of Teman. Surely he will drag the little ones of the flock away. Surely their pasture will be desolate because of them.
24Jr 49:21 The earth will quake at the sound of their fall. A cry - it's her voice - is heard at the Reed Sea.
24Jr 49:22 Look, he will rise up and fly swiftly like an eagle. He will spread his wings against Bozrah, and on that day the hearts of the warriors of Edom will be like the heart of a woman in labor.
24Jr 49:23 To Damascus£º "Hamath and Arpad will be humiliated. Their courage melts because they have heard bad news. There is anxiety like the sea that cannot be calmed.
24Jr 49:24 Damascus will become weak. She will turn to flee, but panic will seize her. Distress and anguish will take hold of her like that of a woman giving birth.
24Jr 49:25 Why is the famous city, the joyful town, not abandoned - 
24Jr 49:26 Therefore her young men will fall in her streets, and all her soldiers will be silenced on that day, declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
24Jr 49:27 I'll kindle a fire in the wall of Damascus, and it will devour the strongholds of Ben-hadad."
24Jr 49:28 To Kedar and the kingdoms of Hazor that King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon destroyed£º This is what the Lord says£º "Arise, go against Kedar! Plunder the people of the east!
24Jr 49:29 Take their tents and their flocks, their tent curtains and all their goods. Take their camels away from them. Cry out against them, 'Terror is all around!'
24Jr 49:30 Flee! Run away quickly! Go to a remote place to stay, residents of Hazor," declares the Lord. For King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has formed a plan and devised a strategy against them."
24Jr 49:31 "Arise, go up against a nation at ease, living securely," declares the Lord, "without gates or bars, living alone.
24Jr 49:32 Their camels will become booty, their many herds will become spoil. I'll scatter to the winds those who shave the corners of their beards, and I'll bring disaster on them from every side," declares the Lord.
24Jr 49:33 "Hazor will become a dwelling place for jackals, a perpetual wasteland. No one will live there; no human being will reside in it.
24Jr 49:34 That which came as the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet about Elam at the beginning of the reign of King Zedekiah of Judah:
24Jr 49:35 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Look, I'm going to break the bow of Elam, the finest of their troops.
24Jr 49:36 I'll bring the four winds against Elam from the four corners of the heavens, and I'll scatter them to all these winds. There will be no nation to which the exiles from Elam won't go.
24Jr 49:37 I'll terrify Elam before their enemies and before those who seek to kill them. I'll bring on them disaster and become fiercely angry at them," declares the Lord. I'll send the sword after them, until I've made an end of them.
24Jr 49:38 I'll put my throne in Elam, and destroy the king and the officials there," declares the Lord.
24Jr 49:39 "But in the latter days I'll restore the fortunes of Elam," declares the Lord.
24Jr 50:1 This is the word that the Lord spoke through the prophet Jeremiah about Babylon, the land of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 50:2 "Declare and proclaim among the nations. Lift up a banner and proclaim. Don't conceal anything. Say, 'Babylon will be captured. Bel will be disgraced, and Marduk will be destroyed. Her idols will be disgraced, and her filthy images will be destroyed.'
24Jr 50:3 For a nation from the north will go up against her. It will make her land into an object of horror, and no one will live in it. Both people and animals will wander off, and they'll leave.
24Jr 50:4 In those days, and at that time," declares the Lord, "the people of Israel will come together with the people of Judah. They'll be weeping as they travel along, and they'll be seeking the Lord their God.
24Jr 50:5 They'll ask the way to Zion, turning their faces in that direction. They'll come and join themselves to the Lord in an everlasting covenant that won't be forgotten.
24Jr 50:6 My people have become lost sheep. Their shepherds have led them astray, turning them toward the mountains. They go from mountain to hill. They have forgotten their resting place.
24Jr 50:7 All who find them devour them, but their enemies say, 'We're not guilty, because they have sinned against the Lord, the habitation of righteousness, the Lord, the hope of their ancestors.'
24Jr 50:8 Move away from the middle of Babylon, and go out of the land of the Chaldeans. Be like male goats at the head of the flock.
24Jr 50:9 Indeed, I'm going to stir up and bring against Babylon a great company of nations from the land of the north. They'll deploy for battle against her, and from there she will be captured. Their arrows will be like a skilled warrior; they won't miss their targets.
24Jr 50:10 The Chaldeans will become plunder, and all who plunder them will get more than enough," declares the Lord.
24Jr 50:11 "Though you rejoice, though you exult, you plunderers of my inheritance, though you skip around like a heifer in the grass and neigh like stallions,
24Jr 50:12 Your mother will be greatly devastated, she who gave birth to you will be ashamed. She will become the least of the nations, a wilderness, a dry land, and a desert.
24Jr 50:13 Because of the anger of the Lord she won't be inhabited, but will be utterly devastated. Everyone who passes by Babylon will be horrified and will scoff because of all her wounds.
24Jr 50:14 Deploy the troops all around Babylon. All who bend the bow, shoot at her and spare no arrows, for she has sinned against the Lord.
24Jr 50:15 Raise a battle cry against her on every side. She has surrendered, her pillars have fallen, her walls are thrown down. For this is the vengeance of the Lord. Take vengeance on her; as she has done, do to her.
24Jr 50:16 Eliminate from Babylon the one who plants seeds and the one who uses the sickle at harvest time. Because of the oppressor's sword, let each one turn toward his own people and flee to his own land.
24Jr 50:17 "Israel is a scattered flock, driven out by lions. The first to devour him was the king of Assyria, and then afterward King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon gnawed his bones.
24Jr 50:18 Therefore this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º 'Look, I'm about to judge the king of Babylon and his land, just as I've judged the king of Assyria.
24Jr 50:19 I'll bring Israel back to his pasture. He will graze on Carmel, on Bashan, on Mt. Ephraim, and on Gilead - his hunger will be satisfied.
24Jr 50:20 In those days and at that time,' declares the Lord, 'the iniquity of Israel will be searched for, but there will be none; and the sin of Judah, but none will be found, because I'll pardon those I leave as a remnant.'"
24Jr 50:21 "Go up against the land of Merathaim and the inhabitants of Pekod. Kill them with swords, and completely destroy them," declares the Lord, "and do everything that I've commanded you.
24Jr 50:22 The noise of battle is in the land, and great destruction.
24Jr 50:23 How the hammer of all the earth is cut off and broken! How Babylon has become a horror among the nations!
24Jr 50:24 I'll set a trap for you, and you will be caught, Babylon, but you don't realize it. You will be found and also seized, because you challenged the Lord!"
24Jr 50:25 The Lord will open his armory, and bring out the weapons of his anger. Indeed, a work of the Lord GOD of the Heavenly Armies will be in the land of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 50:26 "Come to her from afar. Open up her barns. Pile her up like heaps of grain, and completely destroy her. Don't leave any survivors.
24Jr 50:27 "Put all her bulls to the sword, let them go down to the slaughter. How terrible for them because their day has come, the time of their judgment.
24Jr 50:28 "The sound of fugitives and refugees will come from the land of Babylon to declare in Zion the vengeance of the Lord our God, vengeance for his temple.
24Jr 50:29 "Summon many to Babylon, all those who bend the bow. Camp all around her, let no one escape. Repay her according to her deeds. Do to her just as she has done. For she has behaved arrogantly against the Lord, against the Holy One of Israel.
24Jr 50:30 Therefore, her warriors will fall in her streets, and all her soldiers will be silenced on that day," declares the Lord.
24Jr 50:31 Look, I'm against you, arrogant one," declares the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies. "Indeed your day is coming, the time of your judgment.
24Jr 50:32 The arrogant one will stumble and fall, and there will be no one to lift him up. I'll set fire to his cities, and it will devour everything around him."
24Jr 50:33 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "The people of Israel are oppressed, along with the people of Judah. All their captors have held on to them and refused to let them go.
24Jr 50:34 Their Redeemer is strong, the Lord of the Heavenly Armies is his name. He will vigorously plead their case in order to bring rest to the earth, but turmoil to the inhabitants of Babylon.
24Jr 50:35 A sword against the Chaldeans," declares the Lord, "and against the inhabitants of Babylon, against her officials and her wise men.
24Jr 50:36 A sword against the diviners. They'll be made fools. A sword against her warriors. They'll be shattered.
24Jr 50:37 A sword against her horses, against her chariots, and against all the foreign troops in her midst. They'll become women. A sword against her treasures. They'll be plundered.
24Jr 50:38 A drought against her waters. They'll dry up. For it's a land of idols, and they go mad over their terrifying images.
24Jr 50:39 Therefore the desert creatures along with hyenas will live there. They'll live in it with ostriches, but people won't live in it again. They won't inhabit it from generation to generation.
24Jr 50:40 Just as when God overthrew Sodom, Gomorrah, and their neighbors," declares the Lord, "so also no one will live there. No human being will reside in it."
24Jr 50:41 "Look, people are coming from the north. A great nation and many kings will be stirred up from the ends of the earth.
24Jr 50:42 They grab bow and spear. They're cruel and show no mercy. Their sound roars like the sea, as they ride on horses deployed like men ready for battle against you, daughter of Babylon.
24Jr 50:43 The king of Babylon has heard the news about them, and his hands hang limp. Distress has seized him, like a woman in labor.
24Jr 50:44 "Look, like a lion comes up from the thicket of the Jordan to a pasture that grows year round, so I'll drive them away from her in an instant, and I'll appoint whomever is chosen over her. Indeed, who is like me?Who gives me counsel?Who is the shepherd who will stand against me?
24Jr 50:45 Therefore, hear the plan that the Lord has made against Babylon, and the strategy that he devised against the land of the Chaldeans. Surely they'll drag the little ones of the flock away. Surely their pasture will be desolate because of them.
24Jr 50:46 At the shout that Babylon has been seized, the earth will be shaken, and the cry will be heard among the nations.
24Jr 51:1 This is what the Lord says£º "Look, I'm going to stir up a destroying wind against Babylon and the inhabitants of Leb-kamai.
24Jr 51:2 I'll send foreigners to Babylon, and they'll winnow her, and devastate her land. They'll come against her from every side on the day of her disaster.
24Jr 51:3 Don't let the archer bend the bow; don't let him rise up in his armor. Don't spare her young men. Completely destroy her entire army.
24Jr 51:4 The slain will fall in the land of Chaldea, pierced through in her streets.
24Jr 51:5 Indeed, Israel and Judah haven't been abandoned by their God, by the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, although their land is full of guilt against the Holy One of Israel."
24Jr 51:6 Flee from Babylon, and each of you, escape with your life! Don't be destroyed because of her guilt, for it's time for the Lord's vengeance. He is paying back what is due to her.
24Jr 51:7 Babylon was a golden cup in the Lord's hand, making the whole earth drunk. The nations drank her wine, therefore the nations have gone mad.
24Jr 51:8 Suddenly Babylon fell down and was shattered. Wail for her! Bring balm for her wound, perhaps she will be healed.
24Jr 51:9 We tried to heal Babylon, but she wouldn't be healed. Leave her, and let each of us go to his own country. For her judgment has reached to the heavens, and is lifted up to the sky.
24Jr 51:10 The Lord will vindicate us. Come! Let us declare the work of the Lord our God in Zion.
24Jr 51:11 Sharpen the arrows, fill the quivers! The Lord has stirred up the spirit of the kings of the Medes?he has decided to destroy Babylon. Indeed, it's the Lord's vengeance, vengeance for his temple.
24Jr 51:12 Lift up the battle standard against Babylon's walls. Strengthen the guard; post watchmen. Set men in position for an ambush. For the Lord will both plan and carry out what he has declared against the inhabitants of Babylon.
24Jr 51:13 You who live beside many waters, rich in treasures, your end has come, your life thread is cut.
24Jr 51:14 The Lord of the Heavenly Armies has sworn by himself£º "I'll surely fill you with soldiers like a swarm of locusts, and they'll sing songs of victory over you."
24Jr 51:15 He made the earth by his power. He established the world by his wisdom, and by his understanding he spread out the heavens.
24Jr 51:16 When his voice sounds, there is thunder from the waters of heaven, and he makes clouds rise up from the ends of the earth. He makes lightning for the rain and brings wind out of his storehouses.
24Jr 51:17 Everyone is stupid and without knowledge. Every goldsmith is put to shame by his own idols, for his images are false, and there is no life in them.
24Jr 51:18 They're worthless, a work of mockery, and when the time of punishment comes, they'll perish.
24Jr 51:19 The Portion of Jacob is not like these. He made everything, including the tribe of his inheritance. The Lord of the Heavenly Armies is his name.
24Jr 51:20 "You are my war-club and weapons of war. I'll smash nations with you and destroy kingdoms with you.
24Jr 51:21 I'll smash the horse and its rider with you. I'll smash the chariot and its rider with you.
24Jr 51:22 I'll smash man and woman with you. I'll smash old man and young boy with you. I'll smash young man and young woman with you.
24Jr 51:23 I'll smash the shepherd and his flock with you. I'll smash the farmer and his team of oxen with you. I'll smash governors and officials with you.
24Jr 51:24 "Before your eyes I'll repay Babylon and all the inhabitants of Chaldea for all the evil that they did in Zion," declares the Lord. 
24Jr 51:25 "Look, I'm against you, destroying mountain, who destroys the whole earth," declares the Lord. "I'll stretch out my hand against you and roll you down from the crags. And I'll make you a burned-out mountain.
24Jr 51:26 They won't get a cornerstone or a foundation stone from you, because you will be a wasteland forever," declares the Lord.
24Jr 51:27 Lift up a battle standard in the land. Blow a trumpet among the nations. Consecrate the nations against her. Summon the kingdoms of Ararat, Minni, and Ashkenaz against her. Appoint a commander against her, bring up horses like bristling locusts.
24Jr 51:28 Consecrate the nations against her, the kings of the Medes, their governors, their prefects, and every land under their domination.
24Jr 51:29 The land quakes and writhes because the Lord's purposes against Babylon stand firm, to make the land of Babylon a waste without inhabitants.
24Jr 51:30 The warriors of Babylon have stopped fighting. They stay in their strongholds; their strength is dried up; they have become like women. Her buildings are set on fire; the bars of her gates are broken.
24Jr 51:31 One runner runs to meet another runner, and one messenger to meet another messenger, to tell the king of Babylon that his city has been seized from one end to the other.
24Jr 51:32 The fords have been captured, and the marshes burned with fire. The soldiers are terrified.
24Jr 51:33 For this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, says£º "The daughter of Babylon is like a threshing floor at the time when it's pounded down. In just a little while, the time of her harvest will come."
24Jr 51:34 "King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon has devoured me and crushed me. He set me down like an empty vessel. He swallowed me like a monster, and filled his belly with my delicacies. Then he washed me away.
24Jr 51:35 May the violence done to me and my flesh be on Babylon," says the inhabitant of Zion. "May my blood be on the inhabitants of Chaldea," says Jerusalem.
24Jr 51:36 Therefore this is what the Lord says£º "Look, I'm going to argue your case and take vengeance for you. I'll dry up her sea and make her fountain dry.
24Jr 51:37 Babylon will become a heap of ruins, a refuge for jackals, a desolate place and an object of scorn.
24Jr 51:38 They'll roar together like young lions; they'll growl like lion cubs.
24Jr 51:39 When they're excited I'll serve them their banquet, and make them drunk until they're merry. They'll sleep forever and won't wake up," declares the Lord.
24Jr 51:40 "I'll bring them down like lambs for the slaughter, like rams with male goats."
24Jr 51:41 "How Sheshak will be captured, and the prince of all the earth seized. How Babylon will become an object of horror among the nations!
24Jr 51:42 The sea will come up against Babylon, and she will be covered by wave upon wave.
24Jr 51:43 Her cities will become an object of horror, a dry land and a desert, a land in which no one lives, and through which no human being passes.
24Jr 51:44 I'll punish Bel in Babylon, and I'll make what he has swallowed come out of his mouth. The nations will no longer stream to him. Even the wall of Babylon will fall.
24Jr 51:45 "Come out of her, my people, flee for your lives from the Lord's anger!
24Jr 51:46 And now, so your heart does not grow faint, and so you don't become frightened because of the rumors that are heard in the land?a rumor comes one year and then after itanother rumor comes the next year about violence in the land and one ruler against another ruler.
24Jr 51:47 Therefore, look, days are coming when I'll punish the idols of Babylon. Her entire land will be put to shame, and all her slain will fall in her midst.
24Jr 51:48 Then the heavens and the earth and all that are in them will shout for joy about Babylon because the destroyers will come out of the north against her," declares the Lord.
24Jr 51:49 "So Babylon will fall because of the slain of Israel, even as the slain of all the earth have fallen because of Babylon.
24Jr 51:50 Go, you who escaped the sword! Don't stand around! Remember the Lord from far away, and let Jerusalem come to your mind.
24Jr 51:51 We have been put to shame because we have heard insults. Disgrace has covered our faces because foreigners have come into the Holy Places of the Lord's house.
24Jr 51:52 "Therefore, look, days are coming," declares the Lord, "when I'll punish her idols, and throughout her land the wounded will groan.
24Jr 51:53 "Though Babylon should reach up to the heavens and fortify her high fortresses, from me destroyers will come to her," declares the Lord.
24Jr 51:54 The sound of a cry is coming from Babylon, great destruction from the land of the Chaldeans.
24Jr 51:55 For the Lord is destroying Babylon, and he will make the loud sounds from her disappear. Their waves will roar like many waters, the noise of their voices will sound forth.
24Jr 51:56 Indeed, the destroyer is coming against her, against Babylon. Her warriors are captured, and her bows are broken. For the Lord is a God of recompense, and he will repay in full.
24Jr 51:57 I'll make their leaders, their wise men, their governors, their deputies, and their warriors drunk so that they sleep forever and don't wake up," declares the King whose name is the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
24Jr 51:58 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "The broad wall of Babylon will be completely leveled, and its high gate set on fire. and so the peoples toil for nothing, and the nations weary themselves only for fire."
24Jr 51:59 This is the message that Jeremiah the prophet delivered to Neriah's son Seraiah, the grandson of Mahseiah, when he went with King Zedekiah of Judah to Babylon in the fourth year of his reign. Seraiah was the quartermaster.
24Jr 51:60 Jeremiah wrote on a single scroll all the disasters that would come on Babylon, all these things that were written about Babylon.
24Jr 51:61 Jeremiah said to Seraiah, "When you come to Babylon, see that you read all these words,
24Jr 51:62 and say, 'Lord, you have declared about this place that you would destroy it so that there wouldn't be an inhabitant in it, neither human nor animal, because it will be a wasteland forever.'
24Jr 51:63 When you finish reading this scroll, tie a rock around it and throw it into the middle of the Euphrates.
24Jr 51:64 Then say, 'Babylon will sink like this and won't rise from the disaster that I'm bringing on her. Her people will be exhausted.'" This concludes the writings of Jeremiah.
24Jr 52:1 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he began to rule, and he ruled for 11 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.
24Jr 52:2 Zedekiah had done evil in the Lord's sight, just as Jehoiakim had done.
24Jr 52:3 Because Jerusalem and Judah had angered the Lord, he cast them out of his presence. Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon,
24Jr 52:4 and in the ninth year of his reign, in the tenth month, on the tenth day, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came against Jerusalem with all his army. He encamped near it and set up siege works all around it.
24Jr 52:5 The city was under siege until the eleventh year of the reign of King Zedekiah.
24Jr 52:6 By the ninth day of the fourth month the famine became so severe that there was no food for the people of the land.
24Jr 52:7 The wall of the city was broken through, and all the soldiers fled, leaving the city at night by way of the gate between the two walls next to the king's garden, even though the Chaldeans were all around the city. They went in the direction of the Arabah.
24Jr 52:8 The Chaldean army went after the king, overtook Zedekiah in the plains of Jericho, and all his troops were scattered from him.
24Jr 52:9 They captured the king and brought him to the king of Babylon at Riblah in the land of Hamath, where the king of Babylon passed judgment on him.
24Jr 52:10 The king of Babylon killed Zedekiah's sons before his eyes, and he also killed all the Judean officials at Riblah.
24Jr 52:11 He blinded Zedekiah and bound him in bronze shackles. Then the king of Babylon took him to Babylon and put him in prison until he died.
24Jr 52:12 In the fifth month, on the tenth day of the month - it was the nineteenth year of the reign of King Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon - Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard who served the king of Babylon, entered Jerusalem.
24Jr 52:13 He burned the LORD's temple, the king's house, and all the houses in Jerusalem. He also burned every public building with fire.
24Jr 52:14 All the Chaldean troops who were with the captain of the bodyguard tore down all the walls around Jerusalem.
24Jr 52:15 Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard carried into exile some of the poorest of the people, the rest of the people left in the city, the deserters who had defected to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the craftsmen.
24Jr 52:16 But Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard left some of the poorest people of the land to be vinedressers and farmers.
24Jr 52:17 The Chaldeans broke in pieces the bronze pillars that were in the LORD's temple and the stands and the bronze sea that were in the LORD's temple, and they carried all the bronze to Babylon.
24Jr 52:18 They took away the pots, the shovels, the snuffers, the basins, the pans, and all the bronze utensils that were used in the temple service.
24Jr 52:19 The captain of the bodyguard took away the bowls, the fire pans, the basins, the pots, the lamp stands, the pans, and the bowls for libations, both those made of gold and those made of silver.
24Jr 52:20 There was too much bronze to weigh in the two pillars, the one sea, the twelve bronze oxen that were under the sea, and the stands which king Solomon had made for the LORD's temple.
24Jr 52:21 Each of the pillars was eighteen feet high and its circumference eighteen feet. It was hollow and about three inches thick.
24Jr 52:22 On each pillar was a capital of bronze. And the height of each capital was seven and a half feet. Latticework and pomegranates, all of bronze, were all around the capital. And the second pillar was like this, including the pomegranates.
24Jr 52:23 There were 96 pomegranates open to view. In all, there were 100 pomegranates all around the latticework.
24Jr 52:24 The captain of the bodyguard arrested Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the next ranking priest, and the three guards of the gate.
24Jr 52:25 From the city he arrested one of the officers who had been in charge of the troops, seven men from the king's personal advisors who were found in the city, the secretary of the commander of the army who mustered the people of the land, and 60 men of the people of the land who were found inside the city.
24Jr 52:26 Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard arrested them and brought them to the king of Babylon at Riblah.
24Jr 52:27 The king of Babylon struck them down and killed them at Riblah in the land of Hamath. So Judah went into exile from the land.
24Jr 52:28 These are the people Nebuchadnezzar took into exile£º in the seventh year, 3,023 Judeans;
24Jr 52:29 in Nebuchadnezzar's eighteenth year, 832 people from Jerusalem; 
24Jr 52:30 in Nebuchadnezzar's twenty-third year, Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard took 745 people from Judah into exile. All the people taken into exile numbered 4,600.
24Jr 52:31 In the first year of his reign, King Evil-merodach of Babylon, showed favor to King Jehoiachin of Judah by releasing him from prison on the twenty-fifth day of the twelfth month in the thirty-seventh year of the exile of King Jehoiachin of Judah.
24Jr 52:32 He spoke kindly to him and gave him a seat above the seats of the other kings who were in Babylon with him.
24Jr 52:33 Jehoiachin changed his prison clothes and regularly dined with the king as long as he lived.
24Jr 52:34 As for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him daily by the king of Babylon as long as he lived, until the day of his death.

25Lm 1:1 How lonely she lies, the city that thronged with people! Like a widow she has become, this great one among nations! The princess among provinces has become a vassal.
25Lm 1:2 Bitterly she cries in the night, as tears stream down her cheeks. No one consoles her of all her friends. All her neighbors have betrayed her; they have become her enemies.
25Lm 1:3 Judah has gone into exile to escape affliction and servitude. She that sat among the nations, has found no rest. All her pursuers overtook her amid narrow passes.
25Lm 1:4 The roads that lead to Zion are in mourning, because no one travels to the festivals. All her gates are desolate; her priests are moaning. Her young women are grieving, and she is bitter.
25Lm 1:5 Her adversaries dominate her, her enemies prosper. For the Lord has made her suffer because of her many transgressions. Her children have gone away, taken captivity before the enemy.
25Lm 1:6 Fled from cherished Zion are all that were her splendor. Her princes have become like deer that cannot find their feeding grounds. They flee with strength exhausted from their pursuers.
25Lm 1:7 Jerusalem remembers her time of affliction and misery; all her valued belongings of days gone by, when her people fell into enemy hands, with no one to help her, and her enemies stared at her, mocking her downfall.8
25Lm 1:8 Jerusalem sinned greatly, and she became unclean. All who honored her now despise her, because they saw her naked. She herself groans and turns her face away.
25Lm 1:9 Uncleanness has soiled her skirts, and she gave no thought to what would follow. She fell in such a startling way, with no one to comfort her. Look, Lord, upon my affliction, because my enemy is boasting.
25Lm 1:10 The adversary seized in his hands everything she valued. She watched the nations enter her sanctuary; those you forbade to enter your place of meeting.
25Lm 1:11 All her people groaned as they searched for food. They traded their valuables in order to eat, to keep themselves alive. Look, Lord, and see how I have become dishonored.
25Lm 1:12 May it not befall you, all who pass along the road! Look and see£º Is there any grief like my grief dealt out to me, by which the Lord afflicted me in the time of his fierce wrath - 
25Lm 1:13 He sent fire from on high, making it penetrate my bones. He stretched out a net at my feet, forcing me to turn back. He made me desolate; I'm fainting all day long.
25Lm 1:14 The yoke of my sins was bound on, fastened together by his hand. They settled on my neck; he caused my strength to fail. The Lord placed me in the power of those I cannot resist. 14
25Lm 1:15 He rejected all the valiant men - the Lord, in my midst. He set a time to meet with me to crush my young warriors. The Lord has trampled, as in a winepress, the fair virgin that is Judah.
25Lm 1:16 Because of all this, I weep; my eyes stream with tears because far from me is the comforter of my soul. My children are sorrowful, because the enemy has won.
25Lm 1:17 Zion spreads out her hands; no one is there to comfort her. The Lord has issued an order against Jacob, that all who are around him are to be his enemies; Jerusalem has become unclean among them.
25Lm 1:18 The Lord is in the right, but I rebelled against his commands. Listen, please, all you people, and look at my pain - my young men and women have gone into captivity.
25Lm 1:19 I called out to my lovers, but they deceived me. My priests and my elders have died within the city while looking for something to eat to keep themselves alive.
25Lm 1:20 Look, Lord, how distressed I am; all my insides are churning. My heart is troubled within me, because I vigorously rebelled. Outside the sword brings loss of life, while at home death rules.
25Lm 1:21 People heard how I groan, with no one to comfort me. All my adversaries have heard about my troubles; they rejoice that you have caused them. Bring on the day you have promised, so my adversaries will become like me.
25Lm 1:22 May all of their wickedness come to your attention, and deal with them as you have done with me because of all my transgressions. For I am constantly groaning, and my heart is faint.
25Lm 2:1 How the Lord in his wrath shamed cherished Zion! He cast down from heaven to earth the glory of Israel, He did not remember his footstool in the time of his anger.
25Lm 2:2 The Lord swallowed up without pity2 all of Jacob's habitations. In his wrath he tore down the strongholds of fair Judah. He cast to the ground in dishonor both her kingdom and its rulers.
25Lm 2:3 In his fierce wrath he cut off all the strength of Israel. He withdrew his protection as the enemy approached. He burned Jacob like a blazing fire consumes everything around it.
25Lm 2:4 He bent his bow against us as would an enemy, he right hand cocked as would an adversary. He has killed everyone in whom we took pride; in the tent of cherished Zion he poured out his anger like fire.
25Lm 2:5 The Lord has become like an enemy - he has devoured Israel. He has devoured all of her palaces, destroying her fortresses. He filled cherished Judah with mourning and lament. 5
25Lm 2:6 He plowed under his temple like a garden, spoiling his tabernacle. The Lord abolished in Zion both festivals and Sabbaths. In his fierce wrath he despised both king and priest.
25Lm 2:7 The Lord rejected his altar, disavowing his sanctuary. He gave up her palace walls to the control of the enemy. They shouted in the Lord's temple, as though they were attending a day of celebration.
25Lm 2:8 The Lord planned to destroy the walls of cherished Zion. He measured them with his line. He did not withhold his hand from destruction. He made both ramparts and defensive walls mourn; they languish together.
25Lm 2:9 Jerusalem's gates collapsed to the ground; he destroyed and broke the bars of her gates. Both king and prince have gone into captivity. There is no instruction, and the prophets receive no vision from the Lord.
25Lm 2:10 The leaders of cherished Zion sit silently on the ground; they throw dust on their heads and dress in mourning clothes. The young women of Jerusalem bow their heads in sorrow.
25Lm 2:11 My eyes are worn out from crying, my insides are churning, My emotions pour out in grief because my people are destroyed - Children and infants faint in the streets of the city.
25Lm 2:12 They ask their mothers "Is there anything to eat or drink? They faint in the streets of the city like wounded men. Their life ebbs away while they lie on their mother's bosom. 
25Lm 2:13 What can be said about you? To what should you be compared, fair Jerusalem? To what may I liken you, so I may comfort you, fair one of Zion? Indeed, your wound is as deep as the sea - who can heal you?
25Lm 2:14 Your prophets look on your behalf; they see false and deceptive visions. They did not expose your sins in order to restore what had been captured. Instead, they crafted oracles for you that are false and misleading.
25Lm 2:15 Everyone who passes by on the road shake their fists at you. They hiss and shake their heads at cherished Jerusalem£º "Is this the city men used to call 'The Perfection of Beauty,' and 'The Joy of the Entire Earth' ?"
25Lm 2:16 All of your enemies insult you with gaping mouths. They hiss and grind their teeth while saying, "We have devoured her completely. Yes, this is the day that we anticipated! We found it at last; we have seen it!"
25Lm 2:17 The Lord did what he planned. He carried out his threat. Just as he commanded long ago, he has torn down without pity; He let the enemy boast about you and has exalted the power of your enemies.
25Lm 2:18 Cry out from your heart to the Lord,2 wall of fair Zion! Let your tears run down like a river day and night. Allow yourself no rest, and don't stop crying.
25Lm 2:19 Get up and cry aloud in the night, at the beginning of every hour. Pour out your heart like water in the presence of the Lord! Lift up your hands toward him for the lives of your children, who are fainting away at every street corner.
25Lm 2:20 Look, Lord, and take note£º To whom have you done this?Should women eat their offspring, the children they have cuddled?Should priests and prophets be slain in the sanctuary of the Lord - 
25Lm 2:21 Young men and the aged lie on the ground in the streets; my young women and young men have fallen by the sword. You killed them in your anger, slaughtering them without pity.
25Lm 2:22 You have invited those who terrorize me to come round, s if today were a festival. No one has escaped or survived he time of the Lord's anger. My enemy has finished off hose whom I cuddled and raised.
25Lm 3:1 I am a man familiar with affliction - under the rod of God's anger.
25Lm 3:2 He has led me - brought me into darkness, not into light.
25Lm 3:3 He truly turned his hand against me, again and again, all day long.
25Lm 3:4 He made my flesh and skin prematurely old; he broke my bones.
25Lm 3:5 He laid siege against me, surrounding me with bitterness and suffering.
25Lm 3:6 He has forced me to live in darkness, like those who are long dead.
25Lm 3:7 He has walled me in so I cannot escape; he placed heavy chains on me.
25Lm 3:8 Indeed, when I cry out, calling for help, he shuts out my prayer.
25Lm 3:9 He impeded my way with blocks of stone, making my paths uneven.
25Lm 3:10 He is like a bear that lies in wait for me, a lion in hiding.10
25Lm 3:11 He forced me off my path, tearing me to pieces and making me desolate.
25Lm 3:12 He bent his bow, aiming at me with his arrow.
25Lm 3:13 He caused his war arrows to pierce my vital organs.
25Lm 3:14 I have become a laughingstock to all my people, the object of their taunts throughout the day.
25Lm 3:15 He has filled me with bitterness, making me drink wormwood.1
25Lm 3:16 He broke my teeth on gravel, covering me with dust.
25Lm 3:17 You have removed peace from my life; I have forgotten what prosperity is.
25Lm 3:18 So I say, "My strength is gone as is my hope in the Lord."
25Lm 3:19 Remember my affliction and homelessness - wormwood and gall!
25Lm 3:20 My mind keeps reflecting on it, and I become depressed.
25Lm 3:21 This is what comes to mind, and therefore I have hope ?
25Lm 3:22 Because of the Lord's gracious love we are not consumed, since his compassions never end.
25Lm 3:23 They are new every morning - great is your faithfulness!
25Lm 3:24 "The Lord is all I have," says my soul, "Therefore I will trust in him."
25Lm 3:25 The Lord is good to those who wait for him, to the person who searches for him.
25Lm 3:26 It is good to hope and wait patiently for the Lord's salvation.
25Lm 3:27 It is good when a young man carries the yoke of discipline in his youth.
25Lm 3:28 He is to sit apart and remain silent, because the Lord has laid it upon him.
25Lm 3:29 Let him fall face down in the dust, so there may yet be hope.
25Lm 3:30 He will endure being slapped in the face, bringing him public disgrace. 
25Lm 3:31 Indeed, the Lord will not always reject us - 
25Lm 3:32 though he causes grief, his compassion abounds according to his gracious love.
25Lm 3:33 For he does not deliberately hurt or grieve human beings.
25Lm 3:34 When any of the prisoners of the earth are crushed underfoot,
25Lm 3:35 when a person's rights are perverted in defiance of the Most High.
25Lm 3:36 When a man is thwarted in his appeal does the Lord condone it - 
25Lm 3:37 Who can command, and it happens, without the Lord having ordered it - 
25Lm 3:38 Do not both good and evil things proceed from the mouth of the Most High - 
25Lm 3:39 Why should anyone living complain, any mortal, about being punished for sin - 
25Lm 3:40 Let us examine our lifestyles, putting them to the test, and turn back to the Lord.
25Lm 3:41 Let us lift up our hearts and our hands to God in heaven.41
25Lm 3:42 As for us, we have sinned and rebelled; but you have not pardoned us.
25Lm 3:43 Clothing yourself with anger, you pursued us. You killed without pity,
25Lm 3:44 You covered yourself with a cloud that prayer cannot pierce.
25Lm 3:45 You have reduced us to scum and garbage among the nations.
25Lm 3:46 All our enemies jeer at us with gaping mouths.
25Lm 3:47 Panic and pitfalls beset us, along with devastation and ruin.
25Lm 3:48 My eyes run with rivers of tears over the destruction of my cherished people.
25Lm 3:49 My tears pour down ceaselessly; I am far from relief
25Lm 3:50 until the Lord bends down to see from heaven.
25Lm 3:51 What I see grieves my soul because of all the young women of my city.
25Lm 3:52 My enemies hunted me like a bird, viciously and without justification.
25Lm 3:53 They dumped me alive into a pit, sealing me in with stone.
25Lm 3:54 Water closed over my head, and I said, "I'm a dead man."
25Lm 3:55 I called on your name, Lord, from the depths of the Pit,
25Lm 3:56 You heard my voice - don't close your ear to my sighs and cries.
25Lm 3:57 You drew near when I called out to you. You said, "Stop being afraid"358
25Lm 3:58 Lord, you have defended my cause; you have redeemed my life.
25Lm 3:59 Lord, you observed how I have been wronged; now make your ruling in my case.
25Lm 3:60 You examined their plans for vengeance, all of their plots against me.60
25Lm 3:61 Lord, you listened to their insults - 3all their plots against me,
25Lm 3:62 the whisperings of my opponents, their scheming against me all day long.
25Lm 3:63 Watch! Whether they sit down or stand up, they mock me with their songs.
25Lm 3:64 Pay them back, Lord, according to their actions.
25Lm 3:65 Give them an anguished heart; may your curse be upon them!
25Lm 3:66 Pursue them in your anger and destroy them from under the Lord's heaven.
25Lm 4:1 How tarnished the gold has become, the finest gold debased! Sacred stones have been scattered at every street corner.
25Lm 4:2 Though the precious people of Zion were like fine gold, how they are valued like clay vessels, the handiwork of a potter!
25Lm 4:3 Even wild animals nurse, suckling their young; but the women of my people are cruel, like ostriches in the wilderness.
25Lm 4:4 The nursing child's tongue cleaves to its palate from thirst.4Young children beg for bread, but no one gives them any.
25Lm 4:5 Those who enjoyed delicacies lie desolate in the streets. Those who were reared wearing purple scavenge in piles of trash.
25Lm 4:6 The guilt of my cherished people surpasses the sin of Sodom, which was overthrown in a moment, without a hand to help her.
25Lm 4:7 Her princes were purer than snow, whiter than milk. Their bodies were more ruddy than rubies, their beards like the color of precious stones.
25Lm 4:8 Now their faces are blacker than coal; they are unrecognized in the streets. Their skin clings to their bones; it has become dry like a stick.
25Lm 4:9 Those who die by the sword are better off9 than those who die from starvation, who slowly waste away like those pierced through for lack of food from the fields.
25Lm 4:10 With their own hands, compassionate women boil their own children - they become their food - when my beloved people were destroyed.
25Lm 4:11 The Lord has exhausted his wrath, pouring out his fierce anger. He kindled a fire in Zion, consuming its foundations.
25Lm 4:12 None of the kings of the earth would have believed, nor the world's inhabitants, that the adversary and the enemy could have breached the gates of Jerusalem.
25Lm 4:13 Due to the sins committed by her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests who shed in her midst, the blood of the righteous,
25Lm 4:14 people stagger around in the streets like the blind, defiled by blood unclean so that no one is able to touch their clothing.
25Lm 4:15 "Go away! Unclean!" they shouted at them. "Go away! Go away! Don't touch!" When they fled away and wandered, those among the nations decreed, "They cannot live here!"
25Lm 4:16 The Lord himself separated them; he will do nothing more for them. They did not respect their own priests; they did not honor their elders.
25Lm 4:17 Our eyes failed, searching in vain for hope; we kept watching and looking for a nation that would not help.
25Lm 4:18 Our steps were closely stalked, so we couldn't travel on our own streets. Our end is near, our days are over; indeed, our end has come.18
25Lm 4:19 Our pursuers were swifter than soaring eagles; they pursued us over the mountains, laying in wait for us in the wilderness.
25Lm 4:20 The Lord's anointed, the breath of our life, was captured in their pits. About him we had said, "Under his protection we will survive among the nations."
25Lm 4:21 Celebrate and rejoice, you women of Edom, who live in the land of Uz. But to you the cup also will pass - you will become drunk and stripped naked.21
25Lm 4:22 The punishment for your sin is complete, you women of Zion, and God will no longer exile you. He will punish your iniquity, you women of Edom, and he will expose your sins.
25Lm 5:1 Lord, remember what has happened to us. Pay attention, and look at our shame!
25Lm 5:2 Our inheritance has been turned over to strangers, and our homes to foreigners.
25Lm 5:3 We are now orphans - without fathers - and our mothers are like widows.
25Lm 5:4 We pay to drink our own water, and our own wood is sold to us at high price.
25Lm 5:5 Our pursuers breathe down our necks; we are weary, but there is no rest for us.6
25Lm 5:6 We made a deal with the Egyptians and the Assyrians for the price of food.
25Lm 5:7 Our ancestors sinned and no longer exist yet we continue to bear the consequences of their sin.
25Lm 5:8 Slaves rule over us, and no one delivers us from their control.8
25Lm 5:9 We risk our lives to obtain our food, facing death in the desert.
25Lm 5:10 Our skin blisters as from an oven, due to ravaging blasts of the famine.
25Lm 5:11 They have raped women in Zion, young women in the towns of Judah.
25Lm 5:12 Princes they have hung by their hands; elders they have disrespected.
25Lm 5:13 Our young men must grind grain with a millstone; our youths stumble under the weight of wood.
25Lm 5:14 Our elders have ceased ruling at the gate; our young men have abandoned their music.
25Lm 5:15 The joy of our hearts has ceased, and our dancing has turned into dirges.15
25Lm 5:16 The crown has fallen from our head - woe to us, because we have sinned!
25Lm 5:17 This is why our hearts faint, and why our eyes grow dim£º 
25Lm 5:18 Because Mount Zion is desolate; foxes roam around it.
25Lm 5:19 You, Lord, are forever - your throne endures from generation to generation.
25Lm 5:20 So why have you completely forgotten us, forsaking us for so long - 
25Lm 5:21 Restore us to yourself, Lord, so that we may return. Renew our days as before,
25Lm 5:22 unless you have utterly rejected us and are angry with us without limit.

26Ezk 1:1 On the fifth day of the fourth month of the thirtieth year of the exile to Babylon, while I was among the captives on the bank of the Chebar River, heaven opened up and I saw visions from God.
26Ezk 1:2 On the fifth day of the month in the fifth year of King Jehoiachin's imprisonment in exile,
26Ezk 1:3 a message from the Lord came directly to Buzi's son Ezekiel, the priest, by the Chebar River in the land of the Chaldeans. The hand of the Lord rested upon him there.
26Ezk 1:4 I was amazed to see a wind storm blow in from the north, consisting of a massive cloud and fire that was flashing back and forth, surrounded by bright light. From deep within the cloud something was shining that appeared to have a color like bronze that had been placed in fire until it glowed.
26Ezk 1:5 Deep inside it, the likenesses of four living beings were visible. Their appearances were similar to human forms,
26Ezk 1:6 except that they each had four faces, four pairs of wings,
26Ezk 1:7 and straight legs. Their feet resembled calves' hooves, but they gleamed like polished bronze.
26Ezk 1:8 From under their wings there were human hands on their four sides. Now as to their four faces and four pairs of wings,
26Ezk 1:9 their pairs of wings overlapped each other. They moved in straight directions without turning their faces around as they moved.
26Ezk 1:10 The form of their faces was human, but each of the four also had the face of a lion to the right, the face of an ox to the left, and the face of an eagle behind them.
26Ezk 1:11 That's what their faces were like. Their wings spread out above and around them, one pair overlapping another, with one pair covering themselves.
26Ezk 1:12 Each moved in straight directions. Wherever they decided to go, they went without turning themselves.
26Ezk 1:13 Now, in the midst of the living beings there was something that appeared to glow like coals kindled by a fire, like torches that moved back and forth between the living beings. The fire was dazzling, and lightning flashed from the fire.
26Ezk 1:14 The living beings moved around, in appearance like lightning.
26Ezk 1:15 As I observed the living beings, I noticed one wheel on the earth beside each being - that is, for the four of them.
26Ezk 1:16 The appearance of their wheels and their construction details looked like gold-colored beryl. Each wheel was identical in form to the other four wheels, and their appearance and construction details were designed as if one wheel were within another.
26Ezk 1:17 Whenever the four moved, no matter which of four directions, they moved without turning around.1
26Ezk 1:18 Their wheel rims were ornate and terrifying. They were full of eyes that surrounded the four of them.
26Ezk 1:19 Whenever the living beings moved, the wheels moved, too. Whenever the living beings rose from the earth, the wheels rose also.
26Ezk 1:20 Whatever direction these spirits went, the wheels would be lifted up along with them, because the wheels were alive.
26Ezk 1:21 They moved around whenever they wanted to move around, and they stood still whenever they wanted to stand still; and whenever they rose from the earth, the wheels remained close beside them, because the wheels were also alive.
26Ezk 1:22 There was spread out over the heads of the living beings what looked like a canopy, in outward appearance resembling ice,
26Ezk 1:23 and underneath the canopy, their wings spread out straight over their heads toward each other. They each also had two wings with which they covered themselves, one wing covering its body on one side and one wing covering itself on the other side.
26Ezk 1:24 I also heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of roaring water, like the voice of the Almighty, or like a boisterous crowd within an army camp. Whenever they stopped flying, they lowered their wings.
26Ezk 1:25 A sound came from above the canopy that was spread out over their heads. Whenever they stood still, they lowered their wings.
26Ezk 1:26 From above the canopy, that was spread out over their heads there appeared to be something resembling a throne, in form resembling the appearance of sapphire. There was the likeness of the appearance of a human being seated on the likeness of the throne high above.
26Ezk 1:27 I noticed that from what appeared to look like his waist upward there was something that looked like metal that glowed as if it were immersed in fire. Below this there was something resembling fire, with a radiant light surrounding him.
26Ezk 1:28 The appearance of the radiant light resembled that of a rainbow shining in a cloud on a rainy day. This was what the appearance of the form of the glory of the Lord resembled. When I saw all of this, I fell flat on my face. Then I heard a voice speaking.
26Ezk 2:1 "Son of Man," the Lord said, "get up on your feet. I want to talk to you."
26Ezk 2:2 Even while he was speaking to me, the Spirit entered me, set me on my feet, and I listened to the voice that had been speaking to me.
26Ezk 2:3 "Son of Man, I'm sending you to that rebellious people, the Israelites, who have rebelled against me the same way their ancestors did. And they're still rebels to this very day!
26Ezk 2:4 They're stubborn and strong willed. I'm sending you to them to tell them what the Lord says.
26Ezk 2:5 Whether this rebellious group listens to you or not, at least they'll realize that a prophet had appeared in their midst!
26Ezk 2:6 "Now as for you, Son of Man, never be afraid of them or of anything they have to say, because being with them will be like settling down to live among briers, thornbushes, and scorpions! Don't be afraid of anything they have to say, and don't be awed by their appearance, since they are a rebellious group.
26Ezk 2:7 You are to tell hem whatever I have to say to them, whether they listen or not, since they are rebellious."
26Ezk 2:8 "Son of Man, you are to listen to what I tell you. You are never to be rebellious like they are£º a rebellious group. "Now, open your mouth and eat what I'm giving you¡¦"
26Ezk 2:9 As I watched, all of a sudden there was a hand being stretched out in my direction! And there was a scroll
26Ezk 2:10 being unrolled right in front of me! Written on both sides were lamentations, mourning, and cries of grief.
26Ezk 3:1 Then he told me, "Son of Man, eat! Eat what you see?this scroll?and then go talk to the house of Israel."
26Ezk 3:2 So I opened my mouth and he fed me the scroll.
26Ezk 3:3 Then he said to me, "Son of Man, feed your stomach and digest this scroll that I'm giving you." So I ate it, and it was like sweet honey in my mouth. 
26Ezk 3:4 Then he said to me, "Son of Man, go to the house of Israel and tell them what I have to say to them,
26Ezk 3:5 because you're not going to a people whose speech you cannot understand or whose language is difficult to speak. Instead, you're going to the house of Israel.
26Ezk 3:6 This isn't a large group of people whose speech is unintelligible to you or whose language is difficult for you to comprehend. Frankly, if I had sent you to that kind of people, they would certainly have listened to you!
26Ezk 3:7 But the house of Israel won't listen to you, since they weren't willing to listen to me. That's because the entire house of Israel is hard-headed and hard-hearted.
26Ezk 3:8 So pay attention! I'm going to make you just as obstinant and unyielding as they are.
26Ezk 3:9 I'm making you harder than flint?like diamond! So you are not to fear them or be intimidated by how they look at you, since they're a rebellious group."
26Ezk 3:10 Next, he told me, "Son of Man, take to heart every word that I'm telling you. Listen carefully,
26Ezk 3:11 then go immediately to the exiles; that is, to your people's descendants, and tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says¡¦' whether they listen or not."
26Ezk 3:12 Then the Spirit lifted me up and I heard a great earthquake behind me ans the glory of the Lord arose from his place,
26Ezk 3:13 accompanied by the sound of the wings of the living creatures gently touching each other and with the sound of the wheels emanating from the front, accompanied by a great earthquake. 
26Ezk 3:14 Then the Spirit lifted me up and carried me away. I went bitterly with an angry attitude as the hand of the Lord rested on me.
26Ezk 3:15 I came to the exiles at Tel-abib by the Chebar River and sat down among them for seven days, appalled.
26Ezk 3:16 At the end of the seven days, this message from the Lord came to me£º 
26Ezk 3:17 "Son of Man," he said, "I've appointed you to be a watchman over the house of Israel. Therefore when you hear a message that comes from me, you are to warn them for me.
26Ezk 3:18 "So when I say to the wicked, 'You're about to die,' if you don't warn him or instruct the wicked that his ways are wicked so he can live, that wicked man will die in his sin, but I will hold you responsible for his death.
26Ezk 3:19 If you warn the wicked, and he doesn't repent of his wickedness or of his wicked behavior, he'll die in his sin, but you will have saved your own life."
26Ezk 3:20 "When a righteous man abandons his righteousness to practice unrighteousness, I'll set a stumbling block before him. He'll die. If you don't warn him, he'll die in his sin and the righteous deeds that he had practiced won't be remembered, but you'll be held responsible for his death.
26Ezk 3:21 If you warn the righteous person, so that he doesn't commit sin, then he'll live, since he had been warned. And you will have saved your life." 
26Ezk 3:22 The hand of the Lord was upon me, and he said to me, "Get up, and go to the valley and, I'll speak with you there."
26Ezk 3:23 So I got up, went to the valley, and there was the glory of the Lord, standing there just like I had seen at the Kebar River. So I fell on my face.
26Ezk 3:24 The Spirit entered me, rested on me, caused me to stand on my feet, and then he spoke to me. This is what he had to say£º "Go and barricade yourself in your house.
26Ezk 3:25 Now pay attention! They're going to bind you with ropes, tying you up right in their midst, so you won't be able to circulate freely among them.
26Ezk 3:26 Meanwhile, I'll make tongue stick to the roof of your mouth so that you'll be mute and unable to reprove them, since they're a rebellious group.
26Ezk 3:27 But when I speak with you, I'll open your mouth so you can say to them, 'This is what Lord God says£º "As to those who will listen, 'Let them listen,' but as to those who refuse, 'Let them refuse,' since they're a rebellious group."'"
26Ezk 4:1 "And now Son of Man, you are to take a brick, set it in front of you, and inscribe on it the outline of the city?that is, Jerusalem.
26Ezk 4:2 You are to lay siege against it, build a rampart around it, set a bulwark against it, encircle it with a berm, set up camps against it, and place battering rams around it.
26Ezk 4:3 Then you are to take a flat iron plate and set it up as an iron wall between you and the city. "Next, you are to turn toward it, oppose it, and place it under siege, because you are to lay siege to it. All of this will serve as a sign to the house of Israel.
26Ezk 4:4 "Now as for you, you are to sleep on your left side, symbolically bearing the punishment of the house of Israel as you to count the days you'll be sleeping on your left side to bear the punishment of their sin.
26Ezk 4:5 I've assigned you to sleep this way for 390 days, representing the years they've been sinning, as you carry the punishment of the house of Israel.
26Ezk 4:6 When you have completed this, you are to sleep on your right and bear the iniquity of Judah for 40 days, each day representing one year that I've assigned for you. "After this, you are to turn toward the rampart of Jerusalem and oppose it with your bare arms, because I'm going to prophesy about it.
26Ezk 4:8 Look! I'll tie you up so that you're unable to turn from one side to the other until you've completed the duration of your siege."
26Ezk 4:9 "Furthermore, you are to take some wheat, barley, beans, lentils, millet, and spelt, and mix them together in one vessel. Then you are to make bread from these grains sufficient to supply you through the time during which you'll be sleeping on your side. You are to eat it for 390 days.
26Ezk 4:10 The food that you'll be eating is to consist of eight ounce portions for each day, consumed at regular intervals.
26Ezk 4:11 You are to measure a pint and a half of water each time you drink it.
26Ezk 4:12 You are to eat it as barley cakes and bake it right in front of them, using dried human dung for cooking fuel."
26Ezk 4:13 Then the Lord said, "This is how the Israelites will be eating unclean food among the nations, where I'll be sending them."
26Ezk 4:14 "Now, Lord God," I replied, "I've never been defiled, ever since I was young until now. I haven't eaten an animal that died of itself or was torn by beasts, and no unclean meat has ever entered my mouth!"
26Ezk 4:15 "Okay," he responded. "I'll allow you to substitute cow's dung for human dung. Cook your food over that."
26Ezk 4:16 He also told me, "Son of Man, look! I'm about to disrupt the source of bread in Jerusalem. As a result, they'll ration bread by weight in mounting terror and they'll ration drinking water in mounting horror.
26Ezk 4:17 Indeed, they'll need bread and water, but everyone will be panic-striken as they waste away in their iniquity."
26Ezk 5:1 "Now as for you, Son of Man, you are to go find a sharp sword and use it like a barber's razor. You are to cut your hair and beard. Then you are to take a weighing scale and divide your shaved hair into three parts.
26Ezk 5:2 You are to incinerate a third of it in the middle of thecity when you've finished your siege. Next, you are to take another third of it and beat it with your sword. Last, you are to scatter the remaining third to the wind, after which I'll unsheathe my sword and pursue them.
26Ezk 5:3 You are to preserve a few strands of hair and hide them in the folds of your garment.
26Ezk 5:4 Then you are to take a few strands, throw them in the fire, and incinerate them. A fire will proceed to the house of Israel from there."
26Ezk 5:5 "This is what the Lord God says, 'This is Jerusalem. I placed her as the center of the nations, with nations surrounding her.
26Ezk 5:6 But she rebelled against my ordinances and my statutes. She practiced more evil than all the nations and territories around her. They rejected my ordinances and didn't live by my statutes.'
26Ezk 5:7 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º 'Because you're more disrespectful than the nations that surround you, you didn't follow my statutes or follow my ordinances. You didn't even follow the ordinances of the surrounding nations!'
26Ezk 5:8 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º 'Watch out! I-that's right, even I-am against you. I'll carry out my sentence among you right in front of the nations.
26Ezk 5:9 In fact, I'm going to do what I've never done before and what I'll never again do, because of all of your loathsome behavior£º 
26Ezk 5:10 Fathers will eat their children in your midst. After this, your sons will eat their fathers as I carry out my sentence against you and scatter your survivors to the winds!'
26Ezk 5:11 "Therefore, as sure as I live," declares the Lord God, "because you've defiled my sanctuary with every loathsome thing and every abomination, I'll restrain myself, and my eyes won't show pity. Moreover, I won't have compassion.
26Ezk 5:12 A third of you will die by pestilence, starving because of the famine in your midst. Another third will die violently by the violence of war around you. The final third I'll scatter to the wind as I unsheathe my sword to pursue them.
26Ezk 5:13 "Only then will I'll stop being angry?my burning in anger. Then they'll know that I've spoken out in my arduous anger. Only then will my burning against them be exhausted.
26Ezk 5:14 I'm also going to turn you into a waste and an object of insult among the nations that surround you and in front of every person who passes by.
26Ezk 5:15 As a result, Jerusalem will become an insult, an object of taunt, an example of chastisement, and a useless waste to all the nations that surround you when I carry out my sentence against you in my anger, my burning rage, and my burning rebukes. I, the Lord, have spoken it.
26Ezk 5:16 I'll send arrows of severe famine in their direction, meant for destruction, which I'll shoot, intending to destroy them. I'll increase famines that will attack you and I'll disrupt your source of food.
26Ezk 5:17 "I'll send famine and wild beasts against you that will rob you of your children. Pestilence and bloodshed will devastate you when I'll declare war on you. I, the Lord, have spoken."
26Ezk 6:1 The Lord continued with his message to me.
26Ezk 6:2 "Son of Man,"he said, "turn your face to oppose the mountains of Israel and prophesy against them.
26Ezk 6:3 Tell the mountains of Israel to listen as the Lord God speaks. This is what the Lord God has to say to the mountains, hills, streams, and the valleys£º 'Look! I'm about to bring my sword against you. I'm going to destroy your high places.
26Ezk 6:4 Your altars will become desolate and your sun pillars will be shattered. I'll throw your slain down right in front of your idols.
26Ezk 6:5 I'll place the corpses of the Israelites in front of their idols. I'll scatter your bones around your altar.
26Ezk 6:6 In all the places where you live, the cities will be desolate. The high places will also be desolate so that your altars will be laid waste, bearing the punishment appropriate to them. Your idols will be shattered, your sun pillars will be hewn down, and your works will be obliterated.
26Ezk 6:7 The fatally wounded among you will fall, and at that time you'll know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 6:8 I'll leave a remnant among you-those who will escape the sword when I'll have scattered you throughout the earth.
26Ezk 6:9 Your survivors will remember me among the nations where they'll be taken captives. I've been crushed by their unfaithful hearts that have turned against me.
26Ezk 6:10 Then they'll know that I am the Lord. I didn't declare this evil that's intended for them without a reason.'"
26Ezk 6:11 This is what the Lord God says£º "Clap your hands and stamp your feet! Say, 'Oh, no!' Because of all the detestable evil that's comes from Israel's house, they'll fall by the sword, famine, and pestilence.
26Ezk 6:12 The one who lives far away will die by pestilence and the one who is near will die violently. The survivors and their surveillance details will die by famine as I exhaust my rage against them.
26Ezk 6:13 You'll learn that I am the Lord, when the fatally wounded will be among their idols, around their altars, on every hill, on top of the mountains, under every luxuriant tree, and under every high foliage?every place where they've offered fragrant aromas to all their idols.
26Ezk 6:14 I'll stretch out my hands to strike them and send devastation to the land, from the wilderness of Diblah, throughout all their dwelling places. Then they'll know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 7:1 This message from the Lord arrived for me.
26Ezk 7:2 "Son of Man, this is what Lord God says to the land of Israel£º "It's over! All four corners of the land are out of time!
26Ezk 7:3 "Your time is up! I'm sending my anger against you to judge you according to how you live your lives; and I'm going to pay you back with the consequences of all your detestable practices.
26Ezk 7:4 I won't be showing pity on you and I won't be showing compassion. I'm going to turn your own lifestyles against you while your detestable practices remain among you. Then you'll learn that I am the Lord."
26Ezk 7:5 This is what the Lord God says£º "It's one evil event after another! "Look out! It's coming!
26Ezk 7:6 "The end is coming! "The end is here! "And it's looking for you! "Look out! It's arrived!
26Ezk 7:7 "Your doom has come to you, you who live in the land. The time has arrived, and the day of confusion is near. There will be no shouts of joy on the mountains.
26Ezk 7:8 "Very soon now, I'll pour out my burning anger on you. I'll complete expressing my anger at you, judge you according to your behavior, and repay you for all your detestable practices.
26Ezk 7:9 I won't be showing pity or compassion. I'll repay you according to your behavior while your detestable practices remain among you. And you'll know that I, th eLord, have been attacking you.
26Ezk 7:10 "Look out! The day! "Look out! It's coming! "Doom has blossomed. "Arrogance has sprouted!
26Ezk 7:11 "Violence has matured into a branch that is wicked. No one will survive from that vast crowd, from their wealthy people, or from the famous among them.
26Ezk 7:12 "The time has come! "The day has arrived. Let not the buyer rejoice nor the seller lament, because wrath is coming to attack the entire multitude.
26Ezk 7:13 The seller won't regain what he has sold while they're alive, because the vision concerning the entire multitude won't be reversed. No person can fortify himself due to the iniquity in his life. 
26Ezk 7:14 "They've sounded the alarm, and everyone is prepared, but no one is marching for battle, since I'm angry at the entire multitude.
26Ezk 7:15 The sword lurks outside, but pestilence and famine are on the prowl inside the house. Whoever is in the field will die by violence, while famine and pestilence will devour those in the city.
26Ezk 7:16 Fugitives will escape to the mountains like doves fleeing through the valleys, all of them moaning because of their own iniquity.
26Ezk 7:17 Every hand will be limp. Every knee will glisten with sweat."714
26Ezk 7:18 "They'll clothe themselves with sackcloth, terror will overcome them, shame will cover their faces, and baldness will spread over their entire heads.
26Ezk 7:19 They'll fling their silver into the streets, and their gold will be cast away as impure. Their silver and gold won't be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath. They won't be able to satisfy their appetites or fill their stomachs, because their iniquity has tripped them up.
26Ezk 7:20 "As for his beautiful ornament, he set it up in majesty, but they made detestable images and loathsome idols. Therefore I'll give them something loathsome-
26Ezk 7:21 I'll give it as plunder into the control of strangers and as the spoils of war to the wicked who will invade the land to profane it.
26Ezk 7:22 I'll turn my face away from them so that they'll defile my treasured place. Robbers will enter and profane it!
26Ezk 7:23 "Forge a chain, because the land is full of bloody judgment and the city is filled with violence.
26Ezk 7:24 Therefore I'm bringing the worst of the nations, who wi'l take possession of their houses. I'll cause the pride of the mighty to cease, and their sanctuaries will be profaned.
26Ezk 7:25 "When destruction comes, they'll seek peace, but there will be none to be found.
26Ezk 7:26 Disaster upon disaster will come, followed by rumor after rumor. They'll seek an oracle from the prophet, but the law will be gone from the priests, and counsel from the elders.
26Ezk 7:27 "The king will mourn, the prince will be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land will tremble. I'll deal with them according to their behavior and I will judge them by how they've judged. Then they'll learn that I am the Lord."
26Ezk 8:1 In the sixth year, on the fifth day of the sixth month, I was sitting down in my house, with the elders of Judah seated in front of me. All of a sudden, the hand of the Lord God fell upon me there,
26Ezk 8:2 and I saw a likeness comparable to the appearance of a man. From his thighs downward there was the appearance of fire, and from his waist upward, there was the appearance of brightness that looked like brass.
26Ezk 8:3 The form of a hand reached out and took me by the hair of my head. Then the Spirit lifted me up between the earth and sky, brought me toward Jerusalem,and in visions that came from God took me through the doors of the inner gate that faced north, where an image that provoked God's jealous anger had been erected. 
26Ezk 8:4 All of a sudden, the glory of the God of Israel was there!. It looked like what I had seen back in the valley
26Ezk 8:5 Then he said to me, "Son of Man look up toward the north." So I looked off toward the north. Suddenly, off toward the north, facing the gate that led to the altar, the image that provoked God's jealousy was standing near the entrance.
26Ezk 8:6 Then he said to me, "Son of Man, don't you see what they're doing?The house of Israel practices awful, detestable things here, so I'm going far away from my sanctuary. But you're about to see even greater detestable things than these."
26Ezk 8:7 Then he brought me to the entrance of the court. As I watched, all of a sudden, there was a hole in the wall!
26Ezk 8:8 Then he said to me, "Son of Man, dig through the wall!" So I dug into the wall. That's when I uncovered an entrance!
26Ezk 8:9 Then he said to me, "Go on through that entrance, so you may see the wicked, detestable things that they're committing here."
26Ezk 8:10 So I entered, looked around, and there was every form of crawling thing, loathsome animals, and all kinds of idols from the house of Israel carved all around the wall.
26Ezk 8:11 I saw 70 men from the elders of the house of Israel standing among them, including Shaphan's son Jaazaniah. Each man held a censer in his hand. As the scent of the cloud of incense ascended,
26Ezk 8:12 he asked me, "Do you see, son of Man, what the elders of Israel's house are doing in secret, each in the chamber of his own carved idol?They keep saying, 'God doesn't see us. The Lord has abandoned the land.'"
26Ezk 8:13 Then he said to me, "You're about to see even more detestable practices that they're doing!"
26Ezk 8:14 Then he brought me to the entrance of the gate to the Lord's temple, which faced the north. That's where I saw women seated, weeping for Tammuz.
26Ezk 8:15 Then he asked me, "Do you see this, Son of Man?You're about to see even more detestable practices than these. "14
26Ezk 8:16 Then he brought me to the inner court of the Lord's temple. There, at the entrance to the Lord's temple, between the porch and the altar, were 25 men, with their backs toward the Lord's temple and facing the east, prostrating themselves to the sun.
26Ezk 8:17 "Do you see this, Son of Man? he asked me. "Is it an insignificant thing for Judah's house to commit the detestable things that they're doing here?They've filled the land with violence and turned away from me, causing me to become angry again. Look how they're sniffing twigs with their noses!
26Ezk 8:18 I'm going to deal with them in rage and anger. I'll show neither pity nor compassion. They'll cry right into my ears with a loud voice, but I won't listen to them."
26Ezk 9:1 Then he shouted right in my ears with a loud voice! "Come forward," he said, "you executioners of the city, and bring your weapon of destruction in your hand!"
26Ezk 9:2 All of a sudden, I noticed six men approaching from the direction of the upper gate, which faces north. Each of them held a destructive weapon in his hand. Among them there was one man, clothed in linen, who was equipped with a writing set at his side. They went in and presented themselves beside the bronze altar.
26Ezk 9:3 Then the glory that is Israel's God arose from the cherubim on which he had been seated and settled on the threshold of the temple. He called out to the man dressed in linen who wore the writing case at his side.
26Ezk 9:4 The Lord said to him, "Go throughout the city of Jeusalem and put a mark on the foreheads of everyone who sighs and moans over all of the loathsome things that are happening in it."
26Ezk 9:5 As I continued to listen, he also said to the others, "Follow him through the city and start killing. Don't spare anyone you see, and don't show pity of any kind.
26Ezk 9:6 You are to execute old men, young men, young women, little children, and women. But don't touch anyone who has been marked. Begin at my holy place!" And so they started with the elders who were in standing in front of the temple.
26Ezk 9:7 "Desecrate my temple," he told them, "and fill its courtyard with the dead!" So they went out and began sriking down people throughout the city.
26Ezk 9:8 While they were out carrying out the executions, I was left alone. So I fell on my face and cried out, "O Lord God, are you going to destroy all of the survivors of Israel when you pour out your anger on Jerusalem?
26Ezk 9:9 "The house of Israel and Judah is guilty - and it's a stubborn guilt, at that!" he replied to me. "The land is filled with blood, and the city overflows with injustice, because they keep saying, 'The Lord has abandoned the land,' and 'The Lord isn't watching.'
26Ezk 9:10 "So as for me, I'm not going to show pity, and I won't look in their direction with mercy. I'm repaying them for what they have done." 
26Ezk 9:11 Then I noticed the man dressed in linen who wore the writing case by his side as he brought back this message£º "I've done as you have commanded me."
26Ezk 10:1 As I continued to watch, there on the expanse above the heads of the cherubim was a massive sapphire stone, in form and appearance resembling a throne.
26Ezk 10:2 He spoke to the man who was clothed in white linen, telling him, "Go between the whirling wheels, under the cherubim, and fill your hands with burning coals from among the cherubim. Then scatter them over the city." So he entered as I watched.
26Ezk 10:3 Now the cherubim were standing on the south side of the entrance to the temple, when the man entered and a cloud filled the inner court.
26Ezk 10:4 The glory of the Lord rose above the cherub and moved to the threshold of the temple. A cloud filled the temple and the court was filled with the brilliance of the Lord's glory.
26Ezk 10:5 The sound of the wings of the cherubim, reminiscent of the voice of the Sovereign God when he speaks, could be heard as far as the outer court.
26Ezk 10:6 He issued this order to the man who was clothed in white linen. "Take fire from within the whirling wheels, among the cherubim." So he went and stood beside the wheels.
26Ezk 10:7 Then a cherub stretched out his hand to the fire, which was among the cherubim, took some of the fire, and placed it in the hands of the one clothed in white linen, who took it and left.
26Ezk 10:8 There appeared to be human hands under the wings of the cherubim. 
26Ezk 10:9 As I continued to watch, I observed four wheels beside the cherubim, one wheel beside each cherub. The wheels resembled beryl stone.
26Ezk 10:10 In appearance, the four wheels have the same form and likeness as though consisting of a wheel within a wheel.
26Ezk 10:11 Whenever they moved, they proceeded without turning around as they moved, but they followed in the direction where their head was facing, without looking around as they moved. 
26Ezk 10:12 Their entire bodies, backs, hands, and wings were filled with eyes around, including each of their four wheels
26Ezk 10:13 The wheels whose sound I was hearing were called "the whirling wheels".
26Ezk 10:14 Each had four faces. The first one was the face of cherub, the second the face of a man, the third the face of a lion, and the fourth the face of an eagle.12
26Ezk 10:15 The cherubim arose. These were the same beings that I had seen at the Kebar River.
26Ezk 10:16 When the cherubim moved, the wheels went alongside them. But when the cherubim started to ascend, beating their wings to rise above the earth, the wheels beside them didn't turn.
26Ezk 10:17 When they stood still, the wheels stood still. When they rose up, the wheels rose up, too, because they were alive.10 
26Ezk 10:18 Then the glory of the Lord moved out from the threshold of the temple and stood over the cherubim.
26Ezk 10:19 The cherubim lifted their wings and rose above the earth while I watched. They went out, along with their wheels, and stood at the entrance to the east gate of the Lord's temple as the glory of Israel's God remained above and covering them.10
26Ezk 10:20 These were the living beings that I had seen under the God of Israel on the bank of the Kebar River. I knew that they were cherubim.
26Ezk 10:21 Each one had four faces. Each one had four wings, and the form of human hands could be seen under their wings.
26Ezk 10:22 As to the likeness of their faces, they were like what I had seen on the bank of the Kebar River. They each moved straight ahead. 
26Ezk 11:1 The Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the east facing gate of the Lord's temple. At the entrance of the gate I saw 25 men. Included among them were Azzur's son Jaazaniah and Benaiah's son Pelatiah, who were princes of the people.
26Ezk 11:2 Then he said to me, "Son of Man these men are plotting evil and are giving wicked advice in this city.
26Ezk 11:3 They keep saying, 'The right time to build families hasn't yet arrived. The city is the pot and we are the meat."
26Ezk 11:4 Therefore you are to prophesy against them. Prophesy, Son of Man!"
26Ezk 11:5 Just then the Spirit of the Lord took control of me and told me, "You are to say, 'This is what the Lord says£º "You've said, O house of Israel, that I know what goes through your mind.
26Ezk 11:6 You've increased number of fatally wounded in this city and filled your streets with the dead."
26Ezk 11:7 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says, 'The corpses that you've laid out in your midst are the meat, and this city is the cooking pot. But you'll be taken out from the middle of it.
26Ezk 11:8 You've feared the sword, but I'm bringing violent death in your direction,' declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 11:9 'Im bringing you out from the middle of it and I'm going to deliver you into the domination of strangers, because I'm going to carry out my judgments against you.
26Ezk 11:10 You're going to die violently, and I'll judge you as far as the borders of Israel. Then you'll learn that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 11:11 "'This city won't be your cooking pot and neither will you be the meat in it, because I'm going to judge you as far as the borders of Israel.
26Ezk 11:12 Then you'll learn that I am the Lord, because you didn't live by my statues or obey my ordinances. Instead, you obeyed the ordinances of the nations around you.'"
26Ezk 11:13 While I was prophesying, Benaiah's son Pelatiah died, so I fell on my face and cried out with a loud voice. "Ah, Lord God," I said, "are you going to put an end to the survivors within Israel?
26Ezk 11:14 Then this message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 11:15 "SonofMan,yourbrothers,yourotherrelatives,yourfellowexiles, and the entire house of Israel are the people to whom the inhabitants of Jerusalem have said, 'They've abandoned the Lord. This land was given to us for an inheritance.'
26Ezk 11:16 "Therefore you are to say, 'This is what the Lord God says, 'Although I've removed them far away to live among the nations, and although I've scattered them throughout the earth, yet I've continued to be their sanctuary, even for the short time that they will be living in the lands to which they've gone.'
26Ezk 11:17 "Therefore you are to say, 'This is what the Lord God says, "I'm going to gather you from among the nations and assemble you from the lands among which you were dispersed. I'll give you the land of Israel.
26Ezk 11:18 When they return from there and cast away all of their loathsome things and detestable practices,
26Ezk 11:19 then I'll give them a united heart, placing a new spirit within them. I'll remove their stubborn heart and give them a heart that's sensitive to me.
26Ezk 11:20 When they live by my statutes and keep my ordinances by observing them, then they'll be my people and I will be their God.
26Ezk 11:21 But to those whose hearts delight in loathsome things and detestable practices, I'll bring thei consequences of their behavior crashing down on their own heads," declares the Lord God.'"
26Ezk 11:22 Then the cherubim arose, with their wheels alongside, and the glory of Israel's God remained above and over them.
26Ezk 11:23 The glory of the Lord went up from the middle of the city and stood on the mountain, east of the city.
26Ezk 11:24 Then in a vision from the Spirit of God, the Spirit lifted me up and brought me to the exiles in Chaldea. At that point, the vision that I had been observing was removed from me.
26Ezk 11:25 Later, I spoke to the exiles concerning everything the Lord had spoken that I had witnessed.
26Ezk 12:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 12:2 "Son of Man, you live in a rebellious house, that has eyes to see, but they can't see, and ears to hear, but they can't hear, since they're a rebellious house.
26Ezk 12:3 "So now, Son of Man, you are to prepare your luggage for a trip into exile, and then you are leave during the daytime so they see you leaving. Leave from your place to another while they're watching. Then perhaps they'll realize that they're a rebellious house.
26Ezk 12:4 "Bring out your luggage, like you're packing to go into exile, and do this during the daytime while they're watching you. Later that evening, leave while they're watching you like someone heading into exile.
26Ezk 12:5 While they continue to watch, dig a hole for yourself in the wall and enter through it.
26Ezk 12:6 "While they're watching, carry your luggage on your shoulder and go out in total darkness. Cover your face so that you won't see the land, because I'm using you as a sign to Israel's house."
26Ezk 12:7 I did just as I was commanded. I brought out the luggage as if it were luggage for exile. I did this during the day. Then in the evening I dug a hole in the wall with my hand and brought the luggage out in total darkness and carried it out on my shoulder while they were watching.
26Ezk 12:8 The next morning, this message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 12:9 "Son of Man, didn't the house of Israel, that rebellious house, ask you, 'What are you doing?
26Ezk 12:10 Answer them, 'This is what the Lord God says, "This oracle concerns the prince of Jerusalem and the whole of Israel's house that is in their midst.
26Ezk 12:11 Tell them, 'I'm a sign for you. Just as I enacted it, it's going to happen to them. They'll go into exile and captivity.
26Ezk 12:12 Then the prince, who will be one of them, will carry his luggage on his shoulder in the dark and will go out. They'll dig a hole in the wall for him to go through. His face will be covered so that he won't be able to see the land with his eyes.
26Ezk 12:13 But I'll throw my net over him. As a result, he'll be captured with my net, and with it I'll bring him to Babel, the land of the Chaldeans. He won't see it, though he'll die there.
26Ezk 12:14 I'll scatter every attendant who surrounds him, along with his entire army, to every wind. When I unsheathe my sword to pursue them,
26Ezk 12:15 they'll learn that I am the Lor, when I've dispersed them among the nations and scattered them throughout the earth."
26Ezk 12:16 But I'll preserve a few people out of the violent death, famine, and pestilence, so they can recount their detestable practices among the nations when they'll go there. Then they'll know that I am the Lord. 
26Ezk 12:17 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 12:18 "Son of Man, eat your bread with trembling and drink your water with quivering and anxiety.
26Ezk 12:19 Then tell the people of the land, 'This is what the Lord says to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to Israel's land£º They'll eat their food in anxiety and drink their water in trepidation, because their land will be desolate in its entirety due to all the violence committed by all who live in it.
26Ezk 12:20 The towns that are inhabited will lie in ruins, because the land will be devastated. Then they'll learn that I am the Lord.'"
26Ezk 12:21 Later, this message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 12:22 "Son of Man, what's this prover by ou have concerning Israel's land that says, 'The days pass slowly and every vision end sin nothing.' - 
26Ezk 12:23 Therefore you are to tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says, "I'm about to put an end to use of this proverb in Israel. It will never be used again as a proverb in Israel. Instead, tell them that the days are drawing near when every vision will be fulfilled.
26Ezk 12:24 There will no longer be worthless visions and flattering divinations in the midst of Israel's house.
26Ezk 12:25 Becasue I am the Lord, I'll speak and the message that I communicate will be accomplished without delay. While you continue to be a rebellious house, I'll speak the message and then fulfill it," declares the Lord God. 
26Ezk 12:26 Later, this message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 12:27 "Son of Man, pay attention! The house of Israel keep son saying, 'The vision that he's talking about concerns the distant future He's prophesying concerning times that are far in the future!'
26Ezk 12:28 Therefore tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says, "None of my word will be delayed any longer. Any message that I speak will be fulfilled," declares the Lord God.'"
26Ezk 13:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 13:2 "Son of Man, prophesy against the prophets of Israel, who even now are prophesying, and tell those prophets that keep on prophesying according to what they wish would happen, 'Listen to what the Lord says.'"
26Ezk 13:3 "This is what the Lord God says, 'How terrible it will be for the false prophets who walk according to their own wrong inclinations and see nothing.
26Ezk 13:4 Israel, your prophets have become like foxes among ruins.
26Ezk 13:5 You didn't go up to repair the breaches in the walls and you didn't build the walls so Israel's house would be able to endure battle on the day of the Lord.
26Ezk 13:6 Instead, they crafted false prophecies and divination. "They say, '¡¦declares the Lord,' even though the Lord didn't send them. And they hope for the fulfillment of their word.
26Ezk 13:7 You've crafted a false prophesy and spoken deceptive divination, haven't you?But then you say, '¡¦declares the Lord,' although I haven't spoken a single word.
26Ezk 13:8 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says, 'Because you've spoken falsehood and deceptions, I am therefore opposing you,' declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 13:9 My hand will oppose the prophets who see false visions and speak deceptive divinations. They won't be included with the council of my people, nor will they be entered into the registry of Israel's house or enter Israel's land. Then you'll know that I am the Lord God,
26Ezk 13:10 because they've truly caused my people to stray saying, 'Peace,' but there's no peace." "When someone builds a wall, they coat it with whitewash.
26Ezk 13:11 Tell those who coat it with white wash that it will fall. It will be washed off by the rain. Great hail stones will fall and a stormy wind will strip it off.
26Ezk 13:12 Look! When the wall collapses, won't it be said of you, 'Where's the coat of paint that you spread all over the wall?
26Ezk 13:13 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says, 'In my burning anger, I'll rip it open with a windstorm. In my anger, I'll rinse it off with rain, and put an end to it with a hailstorm in my destructive rage.
26Ezk 13:14 I'll tear down the wall that you've smeared with whitewash, level it to the ground, and tear out its foundation. Then it will collapse?and you'll perish with it! Then you'll know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 13:15 "'That's how I'll vent my anger on the wall and on the ones who coated it with whitewash. And I'll say to you, "The wall is gone and so are those who coated it."
26Ezk 13:16 The prophets of Israel prophesied about Jerusalem and saw visions of peace concerning her, yet there's no peace,'" declares the Lord God. 
26Ezk 13:17 "And now, Son of Man, turn toward and oppose the women of your people who prophesy according to their own wrong inclinations and prophesy against them.
26Ezk 13:18 Tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says, "How terrible it will be for those women who sew magical bracelets on all their wrists and make one-size-fits all headbands, in order to entrap their souls. Will you hunt for the souls of my people and remain alive - 
26Ezk 13:19 You've profaned me among my people for a handful of barley and a morsel of bread. You're causing people to die who shouldn't have to die, and you're causing people to live who shouldn't survive, when you deceive my people who tend to listen to lies."'"
26Ezk 13:20 "Therefore, this is what the Lord God says, 'Watch out! I'm opposing your amulets with which you hunt souls as one would swat at a flying insect. I'll tear them off your arms and then deliver those people, whom you've hunted like birds.
26Ezk 13:21 I'll also tear off your veils and deliver my people from your grip so that they won't be under your control anymore. Then you'll know that I am the Lord.'
26Ezk 13:22 "Because you've dismayed the heart of the righteous-whom I never intended to dismay-with lies and because you've encouraged the wicked so that he wouldn't abandon his evil behavior and thereby live,
26Ezk 13:23 you'll no longer see false visions or again practice divination, because I'm going to deliver my people from your power. Then you'll know that I am the Lord."
26Ezk 14:1 Later, some men from the elders of Israel came to visit me. After they had sat down in my presence,
26Ezk 14:2 this message came to me from the Lord.
26Ezk 14:3 "Son of Man, these men have taken idols into their hearts. They've placed the stumbling block that is their own iniquity right in front of their faces. Should I be consulted by them at all - 
26Ezk 14:4 Therefore, speak up and tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says, "Every person from Israel's house who follows his idols and sets the stumbling block that is his own sin in front of his face, and then consults a prophet, I the Lord will answer him according to how many idols he embraces.
26Ezk 14:5 I'll do this in order to capture the hearts of Israel's house who have become alientated from me due to all of their idols."'"
26Ezk 14:6 "Therefore you are to tell Israel's house, 'This is what the Lord God says, "Turn away! Turn away from your idols, and abandon your detestable practices!
26Ezk 14:7 For when a native Israelite or a resident alien abandons me to set up idols in his heart behind my back, and then places the stumbling block of his iniquity right in front of his own face, then approaches a prophet to inquire of me on behalf of his own self-interest, I, the Lord will answer him myself.
26Ezk 14:8 I'm determined to oppose that person and make him an example. Proverbs will be written about him when I eliminate him from my people. Then you'll know that I am the Lord.7
26Ezk 14:9 "Now as to the prophet, if through deceit he delivers a message, I the Lord have deceived that prophet! I'll stretch out my hand in opposition to him and exterminate him from among my people Israel.
26Ezk 14:10 They'll bear the consequences of their guilt, and the prophet will be just as guilty as the one who seeks that prophet's guidance.
26Ezk 14:11 Then Israel's house won't wander away from me again, nor will they defile themselves again with all their transgressions. They'll become my people and I'll be their God," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 14:12 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 14:13 "Son of Man, when a nation sins against me by a treacherous act, I'll stretch out my hand to oppose it by destroying its source of food, by sending famine against it, and by destroying both people and beast within it.
26Ezk 14:14 Though these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job lived in that land, they would only save their own lives on account of their righteousness," declares the Lord God. 
26Ezk 14:15 "If I were to make wild animals pass throughout the land, so that they kill its residents and it were to become desolate because no one will travel through it due to those wild animals,
26Ezk 14:16 then even hough these three men were in it, as I live," says the Lord God, "they wouldn't be able to deliver even their sons or daughters. They would only save themselves, but the land would become desolate.
26Ezk 14:17 "Or if I were to bring war to that land and say, 'Hey, sword! Pass throughout the land so I can destroy both man and beasts in it,'
26Ezk 14:18 though these three men lived there, as I live," declares the Lord God, "they couldn't deliver their own sons and daughters. They would only save themselves. 
26Ezk 14:19 "Or if I were to send a pestilence against that land and pour out my anger in it with bloodshed, destroying both man and beast in it,
26Ezk 14:20 even though Noah, Daniel, and Job were among them, as I live" says the Lord God, "they couldn't save their own sons or daughters. They would only save their own souls due to their own righteousness."
26Ezk 14:21 "This is what the Lord God says, 'I'm sending four of my most destructive judgments-military invasion, famine, wild animals, and pestilence - into Jerusalem to destroy both human beings and livestock in it.
26Ezk 14:22 But look! There will be a remnant who escapees, a few sons and daughters to be brought out. Look! They'll come out to you and you'll see how they've lived and what they've done, and you'll be comforted concerning the catastrophe that I brought on Jerusalem, including everything that I brought against her.
26Ezk 14:23 They'll comfort you when you see how they've lived and what they've done, because you'll know for certain that I haven't done anything that I've done against them without any reason,'" declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 15:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 15:2 "Son of Man, how does wood from a vine compare to a branch taken from any of the trees in the forest - 
26Ezk 15:3 Is wood ever taken from it to make anything practical?Can it even be made into a peg to hang something on - 
26Ezk 15:4 After all, it's useful only for kindling a fire, isn't it?And once you've burnt up the ends and charred through the middle of it, is it useful for anything else - 
26Ezk 15:5 If it was useless before it was burned, now that it's been burned and charred through, it's even more useless!
26Ezk 15:6 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º 'Just as the wood from a grape vine is removed from the forest to be used for kindling fires, I'm giving up the inhabitants of Jerusalem
26Ezk 15:7 to punishment. They may have escaped one fire, but the coming fire will burn them up completely, and they will know that I am the Lord, when I set myself in opposition to them
26Ezk 15:8 and dedicate the land to desolation because of their unfaithful unbelief,' declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 16:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 16:2 "Son of Man, make known to Israel her detestable practices.
26Ezk 16:3 You are to declare, 'This is what the Lord God says to Jerusalem£º "Your birth place was the territory that belonged to the Canaanites. Your father was an Ammonite and your mother was a Hittite.
26Ezk 16:4 Now as to your birth, on the day you were born your umbilical cord wasn't cut. You weren't washed with water to clean you, and nobody rubbed you with salt. And it's certain that you weren't wrapped in strips of cloth.
26Ezk 16:5 Nobody pitied you to do any of these things for you, and nobody showed you any compassion. You were tossed outside on the ground, because you were detested from the day you were born. 
26Ezk 16:6 "'"When I passed by you, I saw you kicking around, covered in your own blood. That's when I said to you, 'Live!' - while you were wallowing in your blood. I commanded to you live, even as you lay there in your own blood.
26Ezk 16:7 I made you increase like sprouting grain in the field. As a result, you multiplied greatly. Eventually, you reached the age when young women start wearing jewlry. Your breasts were formed, your hair had grown, but you were still bare and naked."'"
26Ezk 16:8 "When I passed by you again, I looked at you, and noticed that it was your proper time for love. I spread my cloak over you to cover your nakedness. I made a solemn promise to you and entered into a covenant with you," declares the Lord God. "You belong to me.
26Ezk 16:9 I bathed you with water, rinsed your own blood from you, and anointed you with oil.
26Ezk 16:10 Then I covered you with embroidered clothing, clothed your feet with leather sandals, wrapped you with fine linen, and dressed you in silk.
26Ezk 16:11 I adorned you with jewels, placing bracelets on your hand and necklaces on your neck.
26Ezk 16:12 I put a ring in your nose, earrings in your ears, and a crown encrusted with jewels on your head.
26Ezk 16:13 You were adorned with gold, silver, clothing of fine linen, silk, and embroidery. You ate food made from finest flour, honey, and olive oil. You were exceedingly beautiful, attaining royal status.
26Ezk 16:14 Your fame spread throughout the nations because of your beauty. You were perfectly beauty due to my splendor with which I endowed you," declares the Lord God.8
26Ezk 16:15 "But you trusted in your beauty. You did what whores due, as a result of your fame. You passed out your sexual favors to anyone who passed by, giving yourself to anyone.
26Ezk 16:16 You took some of your clothes and made gaily-colored high places and prostituted yourself all around them-something which had never happened before nor will ever happen again.
26Ezk 16:17 "You also took your fine jewelry - including my gold and my silver that I had given you. Then you made for yourself male images and had sex with them!
26Ezk 16:18 You took your embroidered gowns and made clothes to cover them. Then you offered my olive oil and incense to them.
26Ezk 16:19 "Not only that, you took the food I gave you-my fine flour, olive oil, and honey which with I fed you, and you offered them to those gods in order to appease them. That's exactly what happened," says the Lord God.
26Ezk 16:20 "Then you took your sons and daughters whom you bore to me and sacrificed them for your idols to eat. As though your prostitutions were an insignificant thing,
26Ezk 16:21 you also slaughtered my sons and offered them to idols, incinerating them in fire.
26Ezk 16:22 Throughout all of your detestable practices and immorality, you never did remember your earlier life when you were bare, naked, and wallowing in your own blood."
26Ezk 16:23 "How terrible! How terrible it will be for all of your wickedness!" declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 16:24 "You built raised mounds and high places for yourself on every plaza.
26Ezk 16:25 At every street corner you made your beauty abhorrent when you parted your legs to anyone who passed by. By doing this you committed more and more immorality.
26Ezk 16:26 Then you committed immorality with your neighbors, the Egyptians, with perverted lust, and by doing so you increased your fornications and provoked me to anger.
26Ezk 16:27 "Therefore, look out! I've reached out to oppose you. I withdrew your rations and delivered you to those Philistine women who hate you. Even they were embarrassed at your wicked ways!
26Ezk 16:28 You committed fornication with the Assyrians, because you were never satisfied. You committed fornication with them, but you still weren't satisfied.
26Ezk 16:29 You increased your fornication with that land of the merchants, the Chaldeans. But you weren't satisfied even with these!
26Ezk 16:30 "How weak is your heart," declares the Lord God, "when you committed all of these deeds, the acts of an imperious whore!
26Ezk 16:31 When you built your mound on every street corner and constructed your high place at every plaza, you weren't like a common prostitute, in that you've insulted the wages of a prostitute
26Ezk 16:32 who commits adultery, preferring a stranger over her husband!
26Ezk 16:33 "All prostitutes receive gifts, but you give your gifts to all your lovers then bribe them to come to you from every where for your favors.
26Ezk 16:34 You're different from other women in your fornications - no one can duplicate you in how you commit fornication. After all, you pay fees, but no fee is given to you. You're certainly different!"
26Ezk 16:35 "Therefore listen to this message from the Lord, you whore!
26Ezk 16:36 This is what the Lord God says£º 'Because your lust has been poured out and your nakedness has been uncovered by your acts of fornication with your lovers, and because of all your detestable idols and the blood of your sons, whom you offered to them,
26Ezk 16:37 therefore, watch out! I'm about to gather all your lovers from whom you've received your pleasure, everyone whom you've loved, and those whom you've hated. I'll gather them together to oppose you from every side, and they'll uncover your nakedness in their presence. Then they'll see your completely naked.
26Ezk 16:38 I'll judge you with the same standards by which I issue verdicts against a woman who commits adultery and murder. I'll avenge the blood you've shed with impassioned wrath.37
26Ezk 16:39 "I'll also deliver you into their control, and they'll break down your mounds, tear down your high places, strip off your clothes, remove your fine jewels, and then they'll leave you stark naked!
26Ezk 16:40 They'll bring a mob against you to stone you to death with stones and cut you into pieces with their swords.
26Ezk 16:41 Then they'll burn your houses and execute judgment against you in the sight of many women. "That's how I'll cause you stop your prostitution so you won't pay any prostitute's fees anymore.
26Ezk 16:42 I'll cause my anger against you to stop and I'll turn aside my jealous disposition from you. I'll be calm and not be indignant any more.
26Ezk 16:43 Because you didn't remember the time when you were young, but instead you provoked me to anger because of all these things, watch out! I'm going to bring your behavior back to you," declares the Lord God. "Didn't you do this wickedness, along with all your detestable practices?
26Ezk 16:44 "Now, everyone who likes proverbs will say proverb about you, 'Like mother, like daughter.'
26Ezk 16:45 You're the daughter of your mother, who loathed her husband and children. You're the sister of your sisters, who loathed their husbands and children. "Your mother was a Hittite and your father was an Amorite.
26Ezk 16:46 Your elder sister was Samaria. She and her daughters lived in the north, while your younger sister who lived in the south with her daughters was Sodom.
26Ezk 16:47 It wasn't just that you lived like they did and committed their detestable practices, but in just a little while your behavior led you to become more corrupt than they were!"
26Ezk 16:48 "As I live," declares the Lord God, "your sister Sodom and her daughters didn't do what you and your daughters have done.
26Ezk 16:49 Look! This was the sin of your sister Sodom and her daughters£º Pride, too much food, undisturbed peace, and failure to help the poor and needy.
26Ezk 16:50 In their arrogance, they committed detestable practices in my presence, so when I saw it, I removed them.
26Ezk 16:51 Samaria didn't commit half of your sins-you practiced more detestable practices deeds than they did! You've caused your sister to be more righteous than you, because of the detestable practices that you've committed.
26Ezk 16:52 So now, bear your own shame as you mediate for your sisters. The sins that you've committed, are more detestable than theirs. That makes them more righteous than you. Indeed, be ashamed and bear your reproach, because you've made your sisters to be more righteous than you."
26Ezk 16:53 "I'll reverse their captivity-that is, the captivity of Sodom and her daughters, along with the captivity of Samaria and her daughters and the captivity of your captives among them.
26Ezk 16:54 But you'll continue to bear your own reproach and be humiliated for everything that you've done. You'll be a comfort to them.
26Ezk 16:55 Your sister Sodom and her daughters will be restored to their former status. Samaria and her daughters will be restored to their former status. Then you and your daughters will be restored to your former status.
26Ezk 16:56 "When you were being so arrogant, you never once mentioned your sister Sodom
26Ezk 16:57 before your wickedness was uncovered. Now you've become an object of derision to the inhabitants of Aram and its environs, including the Philistines - all those around you who despise you.
26Ezk 16:58 You are to bear the punishment of your wickedness and detestable practices," declares the Lord,
26Ezk 16:59 "since the Lord God says, 'I'll deal with you according to what you've done, when you despised your oath by breaking the covenant.
26Ezk 16:60 "'Meanwhile, as for me, I'll remember my covenant with you from when you were young, because I'll establish an eternal covenant with you.
26Ezk 16:61 Then you'll remember your behavior and be ashamed when you receive your sisters-your elder sister and your younger sister. I'll give them to you as daughters, but not on account of my covenant with you.
26Ezk 16:62 I'll establish my covenant with you, and then you'll know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 16:63 Then you will remember, be ashamed, and you won't open your mouth any more due to humiliation when I shall have made atonement for you for everything that you've done,' declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 17:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 17:2 "Son of Man, propound a riddle and relate a parable to Israel's house.
26Ezk 17:3 Tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says, "A massive eagle with gigantic wings, long pinions, and full, multi-colored plumage came to Lebanon and took away the top of the cedar.
26Ezk 17:4 He plucked off the top of its shoot, brought it to a land of merchants, and set it down in a city full of traders.
26Ezk 17:5 Then the eagle took a seed from the land and planted it on fertile ground. He planted it like a willow tree next to abundant waters.
26Ezk 17:6 It flourished and became a spreading vine of low stature. Its branches turned toward him, and its roots spread under him to become a vine that put out shoots and spread out its branches.
26Ezk 17:7 "All of a sudden, there was another eagle with gigantic wings and thick plumage. The vine stretched its roots hungrily toward him and spread its branches out to him in order to be watered on the terraces where it was planted.
26Ezk 17:8 It was transplanted into good soil near abundant water, and it produced branches and bore fruit, becoming a magnificent vine."
26Ezk 17:9 "Tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says, "Will it prosper?Won't it pull up its roots, and be stripped bare so that all of its fresh foliage dries up?It won't be by great strength or great army that its roots will be pulled out.
26Ezk 17:10 Look! Because it's a transplanted vine, won't it wither when the east wind strikes against it?It will surely wither in the terraces where it had started to sprout."'"
26Ezk 17:11 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 17:12 "Tell my rebellious house, 'Don't you know what these things mean?Look! The king of Babylon came to Jerusalem, captured her king and princes, and took them with him to Babylon.
26Ezk 17:13 Then he took one of the royal descendants, made a covenant with him, and put him under an oath of loyalty. He took the leaders of the land captive
26Ezk 17:14 in order to humiliate the kingdom so it wouldn't be able to come back into power, but would still be able to continue as long as he keeps his covenant.
26Ezk 17:15 But he rebelled against the king of Babylon by sending his messengers to Egypt to obtain horses and a large army. Will he succeed?Or will the one who did this escape?Will he break the covenant, but still yet anyway?"
26Ezk 17:16 "As long as I live," declares the Lord God, in Babylon, "that place where the king has enthroned him, whose oath he despised so as to break his covenant, he'll die with him.
26Ezk 17:17 Pharaoh, with his massive army and large batallions won't protect him when mounds and siege walls are built to destroy many people.
26Ezk 17:18 He despised the oath he had made and broke the covenant. Look! Because he willingly submitted, yet he has done all these things, he won't escape. 
26Ezk 17:19 "Therefore, this is what the Lord God says, 'As long as I live, because he despised my oath and broke my covenant, I'll bring it upon his head.
26Ezk 17:20 I'll spread my net over him so that he'll be caught in my snare. I'll bring him to Babylon and enter into judgment with him there for his treacherous acts that he committed against me.
26Ezk 17:21 The fugitives of his troops will die by the sword, and the survivors will be scattered to the four winds. Then you'll know that I, the Lord, have spoken.'"
26Ezk 17:22 "This is what the Lord God says, 'I'm also going to take a shoot from the top of a cedar and plant it. I'll pluck off its delicate twigs and transplant it on a high and lofty mountain.
26Ezk 17:23 I'll transplant it on Israel's land, and it will bring out branches, bear fruit, and become a majestic cedar. All sorts of birds will rest under it, and they'll settle down in the shade of its branches.
26Ezk 17:24 Then all the trees of the fields will know that I, the Lord, bring down the lofty tree and exalt the lowly tree. I dry up the green tree and cause the dry tree to bud. I the Lord have spoken this, and I will fulfill it.'"
26Ezk 18:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 18:2 "Why do you cite this proverb when you talk about Israel's land£º 'The fathers eat sour grapes but it's their chidlren's teeth that have lost their sharpness.'
26Ezk 18:3 As long as I live," declares the Lord, "you won't use this proverb about Israel anymore.
26Ezk 18:4 Look! Every living soul belongs to me-the father's as well as the son's. So pay attention! The person who keeps on sinning is going to die."
26Ezk 18:5 "If a person is righteous, and practices what's lawful and right,
26Ezk 18:6 if he doesn't eat at mountain shrines, and doesn't look to the idols that have been erected in Israel's house, if he doesn't defile his neighbor's wife or approach a woman during her time of menstrul separation,
26Ezk 18:7 if he doesn't oppress anyone, but instead returns the debtor's security for his debt, if he doesn't rob anyone, but instead shares his food to the hungry and covers the naked with clothing,
26Ezk 18:8 if he doesn't lend with usury or exact interest, but instead refuses to participate in what is unjust, if he executes true justice between man and man,
26Ezk 18:9 if he lives his life in my statutes and keeps my ordinances by practicing what's true, then he's righteous and will certainly live," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 18:10 "Now suppose that person produces a son who's violent, a murderer, and practices any of these things,
26Ezk 18:11 even though the father hasn't done any of these things. The son who eats at mountain shrines, defiles his neighbor's wife,
26Ezk 18:12 oppresses the afflicted and the poor, robs others, doesn't return security for a debt, looks to idols does detestable things,
26Ezk 18:13 loans with usury, and exacts interest, will he live?He certainly will not! He has done all these detestable practices. He will certainly die, and his guilt will be his own fault."
26Ezk 18:14 "Noow suppose that he produced a son who practiced all of his father's sins, but then that son began to fear me and stopped doing all of these things.
26Ezk 18:15 That is, suppose he doesn't eat at the mountain shrines, doesn't look to the idols of Israel's house, doesn't defile his neighbor's wife,
26Ezk 18:16 doesn't oppress anyone, doesn't take possession of a debtor's pledge, or doesn't steal, but instead shares his food with the hungry and covers the naked with clothing,
26Ezk 18:17 doesn't refuse to help the afflicted, or refuses to loan with usury or exact interest, but instead carries my ordinances and lives his life consistent with my statutes. He won't die because of his father's sin, will he?No! He'll certainly live.
26Ezk 18:18 As for his father, watch out! If he wrongfully oppressed or robbed his brother and did what wasn't good among his people, he'll die in his own sin."15
26Ezk 18:19 "Yet you keep asking, 'Why wouldn't the son bear the punishment of his father's sin? Because the son has done what was lawful and right, and has kept all my statutes and obeyed them, he's certainly going to live.
26Ezk 18:20 The soul who sins dies. The son won't bear the punishment of his father's sin and the father won't bear the punishment of his son's sin. The righteous deeds of the righteous will be attributed to him, while the wicked deeds of the wicked will be charged against him.
26Ezk 18:21 But if the wicked turns from all his sins, which he did and keeps my statutes, then he'll live. He won't die.
26Ezk 18:22 None of the transgressions that he had committed, will be remembered against him. Because of the righteous deeds that he had done, he'll live.
26Ezk 18:23 "Do I take delight in the death of the wicked? asks the Lord God. "Shouldn't I rather delight when he turns from his wicked ways and lives - 
26Ezk 18:24 But when the righteous person abandons his righteous deeds and commits evil, detestable practices, as wicked people do, will he live?None of the righteous acts that he had done will be remembered. With his unfaithfulness where he had acted treacherously and his sins, which he had committed, he'll die in them."
26Ezk 18:25 "Yet you keep saying, 'The Lord isn't being consistent with his standards.' Pay attention, you house of Israel£º Is my behavior really inconsistent with my standards?Isn't it your behavior that isn't just - 
26Ezk 18:26 "When a righteous person turns from his righteous deeds and does evil, he'll die because of that evil. He'll die because of his unrighteous acts that he committed.
26Ezk 18:27 When a wicked person abandons his wicked behavior that he had committed and does what's just and right, he'll be enabled to live.
26Ezk 18:28 Because he considered his transgression and turned away from all of what he had committed, he'll certainly surely live and not die.
26Ezk 18:29 Yet Israel's house keeps saying, 'The Lord isn't being consistent with his standards. Isn't my behavior really inconsistent with my standards?Is it not your behavior that is inconsistent with my standards?
26Ezk 18:30 "Therefore, Israel, I'm going to judge you according to the behavior of each and every one of you," declares the Lord God. "So repent and turn from all your sins so that sin won't keep on being a stumbling block for you.
26Ezk 18:31 Throw away all of your transgressions, the deeds by which you've rebelled, and then make for yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. Why should you die, you house of Israel - 
26Ezk 18:32 I don't take pleasure in the death of anyone who dies," declares the Lord. "So repent, so you may live!"
26Ezk 19:1 "Now as for you, publish this mourning psalm about Israel's leaders.
26Ezk 19:2 Tell them£º 'What a lioness your mother was among lions! She reared her cubs in the midst of fierce young males.
26Ezk 19:3 She raised one cub in particular, teaching that fierce lion to become a hunter-prowler?to eat human beings.
26Ezk 19:4 The nations heard about him. He had become caught in their trap. They brought him with hooks to the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 19:5 When she learned that her plans had been frustrated and that her hopes were dashed, she took another of her cubs and turned him into a fierce lion.
26Ezk 19:6 He prowled around among the lions, became a strong, young lion, and learned to become a hunter-prowler?to eat human beings.
26Ezk 19:7 He raped the women, devastating their towns. The land was made desolate, and all the while the land was filled with the sound of his roaring.
26Ezk 19:8 The surrounding nations attacked. They tossed their net over him, and he was caught in their trap.
26Ezk 19:9 The imprisoned him in a cage with hooks and brought him to the king of Babel. Then they placed him in their dungeon where his voice would no longer be heard on the mountains of Israel.
26Ezk 19:10 'Your mother was like a vine entwining a pomegranate, planted by water, full of fruit, and full of branches because it had been watered generously.
26Ezk 19:11 Strong were its boughs, suitable for use in the scepter of a ruler. It reached to the clouds, noticeable because of its height and its abundant branches.
26Ezk 19:12 Yet in anger it was uprooted and cast down to the earth. An east wind dessicated its fruit; its strong branches broke off and withered, and a fire consumed them.
26Ezk 19:13 Now it is planted in the desert, in a dry and thirsty land!
26Ezk 19:14 Fire had burned through its branches, consuming its shoots and fruits. No strong branches remain in it, and there is no scepter to rule!' "This is a lamentation, and it is to be used in mourning."
26Ezk 20:1 On the seventh year, on the tenth day of the fifth month, men came from the elders of Israel to seek the Lord. They sat down in front of me.
26Ezk 20:2 "Son of Man," the Lord told me,
26Ezk 20:3 "Tell the elders of Israel, 'This is what the Lord God asks, "Did you come to inquire of me?As long as I live, I won't let myself be sought by you," declares the Lord God.'
26Ezk 20:4 "Will you judge them?Son of Man, will you indeed judge them?Teach them about the detestable practices that their ancestors did.
26Ezk 20:5 Tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says, "The day I chose Israel, when I made my commitment to the descendants of Jacob's house, I revealed myself to them in the land of Egypt and I made my promise to them with the words 'I am the Lord your God.'
26Ezk 20:6 That day I promised to bring them out of the land of Egypt to the land that I had explored for them - a land flowing with milk and honey. It's the most beautiful of all lands.
26Ezk 20:7 Then I said to them, 'Each of you are to abandon your detestable practices. You are not to defile yourselves with Egypt's idols. I am the Lord your God.'"
26Ezk 20:8 "But they rebelled against me and weren't willing to obey me. None of them abandoned their detestable practices or their Egyptian idols. So I said, 'I'll pour out my anger and spend my fury against them in the midst of the land of Egypt.'
26Ezk 20:9 I did this so my reputation might not be tarnished among the nations where they were living, among whom I made myself known in their presence when I brought them out of the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 20:10 I brought them out of the land of Egypt to bring them to the wilderness
26Ezk 20:11 where I gave them my statutes and revealed my ordinances to them, which if a person observes, he'll live by them.
26Ezk 20:12 Also, I instituted my Sabbath for them as a sign between me and them, so they would know that I am the Lord, who has set them apart."
26Ezk 20:13 "But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness. They didn't live by my statutes. They despised my ordinances, which if a person observes, he'll live by them. They greatly profaned my Sabbaths. So I said I would pour out my anger on them and bring them to an end in the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:14 I did this so my reputation wouldn't be tarnished among the nations in whose presence I had brought them out.
26Ezk 20:15 "Moreover, I solemnly swore to them in the wilderness that I wouldn't bring them to the land that I had given them?a land flowing with milk and honey, the most beautiful of all lands - 16because they kept on rejecting my ordinances. They didn't live life consistent with my statutes, they profaned my Sabbaths, and their hearts followed their idols.
26Ezk 20:17 Even then, I looked on them with compassion and didn't completely destroy them in the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:18 I told their children in the wilderness, 'You are not to follow the statutes of your ancestors, observe their ordinances, or be defiled by their idols.
26Ezk 20:19 I am the Lord your God. You are to follow my statutes, observe my ordinances, and keep them.
26Ezk 20:20 You are to make my Sabbaths sacred, and you are to let them serve as a sign between you and me, so that you may know that I am the Lord your God."
26Ezk 20:21 "But they rebelled against me. They didn't live according to my statutes, observe my ordinances, or practice them, by which a person will live. They also kept profaning my Sabbaths. So I said that I was going to pour out my anger on them and in my anger bring a complete end to them in the wilderness.
26Ezk 20:22 But I withdrew my decision so my reputation wouldn't be tarnished among the nations before whose eyes I brought them out.
26Ezk 20:23 "Futhermore, I solemnly swore in the wilderness to disperse them among the nations and scatter them to other lands
26Ezk 20:24 because they didn't observe my ordinances. Instead, they rejected my statutes, profaned my Sabbaths, and worshipped their ancestors' idols.
26Ezk 20:25 So I gave them statutes that weren't good and ordinances by which they could not live.
26Ezk 20:26 I made them unclean because of their offerings, so they made all their firstborn to pass through the fire, so that I could make them appalled. Then they'll know that I am the Lord."
26Ezk 20:27 "Therefore, Son of Man, you are to speak to the children of Israel and tell them, "This is what the Lord God says£º 'Your ancestors also blasphemed me in their treacherous behavior against me.
26Ezk 20:28 I brought them to the land that I had promised to give them. But whenever they saw any high hill and or any leafy tree, they slaughtered their sacrifices there and presented their offerings that provoked my anger. There they presented their pleasing aromas and poured out their drink offering.
26Ezk 20:29 So I asked them, "What is the high place to which you're going? That's why the name of the place has been called Bamah to this day.'"
26Ezk 20:30 "Therefore you are to say to Israel's house, "This is what the Lord God says£º 'Will you defile yourselves like your ancestors did by acting as a prostitute, consistent with their horrible deeds - 
26Ezk 20:31 When you present your gifts and make your sons pass through the fire, you continue to defile yourselves with your idols to this day. Should I be inquired of by you, you house of Israel?As I live,' declares the Lord, 'I certainly won't be inquired of by you.'
26Ezk 20:32 The thing that you're imagining is never going to happen, since you're thinking, 'We'll be like the nations, like the clans of other lands who serve gods made from wood and stone.'"
26Ezk 20:33 "As I live," declares the Lord God, "with my powerful hand and outstreched arm, along with my wrath poured out, I'll reign as king over you.
26Ezk 20:34 I'll bring you out from the peoples and gather you from the lands where you were scattered. With a powerful hand, with an outstretched arm, and with wrath poured out
26Ezk 20:35 I'll bring you into the wilderness of the peoples. I'll enter into judgment with you there face to face.
26Ezk 20:36 Just as I've entered into judgment with your ancestors in the wilderness in the land of Egypt, so I'll enter into judgment with you," declares the Lord.
26Ezk 20:37 "I'll cause you to pass under the rod until I shall have brought you into the bond of the covenant.
26Ezk 20:38 I'll eliminate the rebels among you, along with those who are transgressing against me. I'll bring them out of the land where you've lived, but they won't be able to enter the land of Israel. Then you'll know that I am the Lord."
26Ezk 20:39 "And now, you house of Israel, this is what the Lord God says, 'Go ahead and serve your idols, and thereafter, but later you'll listen to me, and you won't profane my sacred name again by your offerings and idols."
26Ezk 20:40 "For on my holy mountain, on Israel's high mountains," declares the Lord God, "the whole of Israel's house, all of it, will serve me there in the land. I'll accept them there. And there I'll demand your offerings, the first fruits of your portions of all your sacred things.
26Ezk 20:41 "When I shall have brought you from among the people and have gathered you from the lands where you were scattered, I'll accept you as a pleasing aroma. I'll reveal my holiness among you, and the entire world will see it.
26Ezk 20:42 Then you'll know that I, the Lord, brought you to the land of Israel, to the land that I promised to give to your ancestors.
26Ezk 20:43 You'll remember all your practices and evils deeds by which you've become defiled. You'll loathe yourselves in your own sight because of all the evil things you've done.
26Ezk 20:44 Then you'll know that I am the Lord, when I shall have dealt with you for the benefit of my own reputation and not according to your evil attitudes or corrupt practices, you house of Israel," declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 20:45 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 20:46 "Son of Man, turn to the south and oppose it, talking toward the south.
26Ezk 20:47 Prophesy against the forest of the Negev, 'Listen to the word of the Lord. This is what the Lord God says£º 'Look out! I'm about to kindle a fire against you that will devour tree?whether green or dry?that lives in you. This powerful flame will not be extinguishable, and the entire surface from so uth to north will be scorched by it.
26Ezk 20:48 Then everyone will see that I, the Lord, have kindled it, because it won't be extinguished."
26Ezk 20:49 Then I said, "O Lord God! They're saying about me, 'Isn't he one to propound parables?" 
26Ezk 21:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 21:2 "Son of Man, look toward Jerusalem, preach against its sanctuaries, and prophesy against Israel's land.
26Ezk 21:3 Declare to Israel's land, 'This is what the Lord says£º "Watch out! I'm against you! I'm going to unsheathe my sword to kill both the righteous and the wicked among you.
26Ezk 21:4 Since I'm going to kill both the righteous and the wicked among you, I'll be unsheathing my sword against everyone from south to north.
26Ezk 21:5 Then everyone will know that I am the Lord, who unsheathed my sword, and who won't have to unsheathe it again."'
26Ezk 21:6 "And now, Son of Man, you are to start groaning until you're sick to your stomach. You are to groan bitterly right in front of them.
26Ezk 21:7 When they'll ask you, 'Why are you groaning? you are to say, 'Because of the news that just arrived. Every heart will melt with fear, every hand will grow limp, every spirit will grow faint, and every knee will glisten with sweat.' Look! It has come and it will be fulfilled," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 21:8 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 21:9 "Son of Man, prophesy and say, 'This is what the Lord God says£º 'A sword! A sword is being sharpened. It's also being polished.
26Ezk 21:10 It's being sharpened for slaughter, and being polished to gleam like lightning.' "We shouldn't be rejoicing, should we, while my Son's scepter, the sword, is despising every tree - 
26Ezk 21:11 "It's intended to be polished so it can be grasped in the hand. The sword is sharpened. It's polished for placement into the hand of the executioner.
26Ezk 21:12 "Cry and wail, you Son of Man! It's headed against my people. It's also against all the princes of Israel, who have been tossed to the sword, along with my people. So it's time to grieve like you mean it,
26Ezk 21:13 because testing is sure to come. "In putting the sword to the test along with the scepter, it won't keep on rejecting, will it? declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 21:14 "Now, Son of Man, prophesy as you strike your hands together. Let the sword that fatally wounds be doubled and tripled. That great, slaughtering sword closes in on them. I've set in place a slaughtering sword at the entrance to all their gates,
26Ezk 21:15 so that their hearts melt and the number of those who stumble increase. I've set in place a slaughtering sword at the entrance to all their gates. Oh, no! It's made like lightning. It's drawn to slaughter. Be sharp! Attack on the right, or parry to your left, wherever you point your sword.
26Ezk 21:17 I will also clap my hands; then my anger will subside. I, the Lord have spoken it."
26Ezk 21:18 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 21:19 "Now, Son of Man, demarcate two pathways by which the sword of Babylon's king will arrive in the land. Both pathways will lead from a single land. "Make a sign, carving it out and installing it at the junction on the way to the city.
26Ezk 21:20 Set it to point one way for bringing the sword against Rabbah, the descendants of Ammon, and the other way against Judah and fortified Jerusalem.
26Ezk 21:21 "Meanwhile, Babylon's king is standing at the fork of the road, where he can head in either of two directions, and that's where he is practicing divination. Shaking his arrows, he's asking questions of his teraphim while he examines livers.
26Ezk 21:22 On his right hand he is divining against Jerusalem, preparing to set up battering rams, preparing for the slaughter, getting ready to sound the alarm for battle, setting the battering rams in place at the gates, building siege mounds, and erecting a siege wall.
26Ezk 21:23 Iin their view it will seem to be a false prophecy, but because they swore allegiance, he'll make them remember their guilt as he takes them captive."
26Ezk 21:24 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º 'Because you brought your sins to remembrance when your transgressions were uncovered, your sins are visibly evident in everything you've done. And since you brought them to remembrance, you'll be taken captive.'

26Ezk 21:28 And now Son of Man, prophesy to the Ammonites that this is what the Lord God says to the Ammonites cabout their approaching humiliation£º "A sword! A sword is being drawn for slaughter. It's polished to flash like lightning.

26Ezk 21:30 Return it to its scabbard. "At the place where you were formed, in the land of your origin, there is where I'll judge you.
26Ezk 21:31 I'm going to pour out my indignation all over you. I'll blow my fierce wrath against you and deliver you into the control of brutal men who are skilled at destruction.
26Ezk 21:32 You'll be fuel for the conflagration. Your blood will be spilled throughout the land. You won't be remembered anymore, now that I, the Lord, have spoken."
26Ezk 22:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 22:2 "Now, Son of Man, will you truly judge that blood-stained city?Then make her aware of all of her detestable practices.
26Ezk 22:3 "You are to say, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "The city keeps on shedding blood within her, bringing about her time of judgment. She crafts idols that defile her.
26Ezk 22:4 "You're guilty because of the blood that you've shed. You were defiled by the idols that you've made. You've caused your time of judgment to draw near and have even come to the end of your years. Therefore, I've made you an object of derision among the nations and to other lands.
26Ezk 22:5 Those who are both near and far away from you will scoff at you, because your reputation will be infamous and full of turmoil.
26Ezk 22:6 "Watch out! Each of the princes of Israel has misused his authority to shed blood.
26Ezk 22:7 They've treated mothers and fathers among you with contempt. They've oppressed the foreigner among you. They've maltreated the orphan and the widow among you.
26Ezk 22:8 "You have despised my sacred things and profaned my Sabbaths.
26Ezk 22:9 Slanderous men live among you, intent on shedding blood. They've eaten at the toop of mountain shrines. They've crafted plans to do evil things among you.
26Ezk 22:10 They've revealed the nakedness of their father in your midst. They've humiliated those among you who were unclean due to her impurity.
26Ezk 22:11 One of you commits detestable practices with his neighbor's wife. Another sexually defiles his daughter-in-law. Another humiliates his sister, his own father's daughter.
26Ezk 22:12 They take bribes among you to shed blood. You've taken usury and exacted interest. You've gained control over your neighbor through extortion. And you've forgotten me," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 22:13 "Watch out! I'm vehemently angry about the unjust gains that you've earned, and about the blood that has been shed among you.
26Ezk 22:14 Can your heart stand up to this?Can your hands remain strong when I deal with you?I, the Lord, have spoken and will fulfill this.
26Ezk 22:15 I'm going to disperse you among the nations and scatter you to other lands. I'm going to put an end to your uncleanness.
26Ezk 22:16 When you've been defiled in the sight of the nations, then you'll know that I am the Lord."
26Ezk 22:17 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 22:18 "Son of Man, Israel has become like dross to me. All of them are like remnants of bronze, tin, iron, and lead in a furnace-the dross left over from smelting silver.
26Ezk 22:19 Therefore this is what the Lord God says, 'Because all of you have become dross, watch out! I'm going to gather all of you at the center of Jerusalem,
26Ezk 22:20 just like a smelter gathers all the silver, bronze, lead, and tin to the center of a furnace and inects fire in order to melt it, I'm going to gather you in my anger and rage, make you settle down-and then I'm going to melt you down.
26Ezk 22:21 Indeed, I'm going to gather you together and exale the fire of my fury, and then you'll be melted from the inside out
26Ezk 22:22 like melting silver at the center of a furnace. When you've been melted from the center out, then you'll know that I am the Lord. I'll pour out my anger on you.'" 
26Ezk 22:23 This message came to me from the Lord;
26Ezk 22:24 "Son of Man, tell her, 'You're a land that hasn't been purified, one that hasn't been rained on in the day of indignation.
26Ezk 22:25 There's a conspiracy of prophets within her, and like a roaring lion tearing its prey, they've devoured people, and confiscated treasures, and taken precious things. They've added to the population of widows within her.
26Ezk 22:26 Her priests have violated my law and profaned my sacred things. They didn't differentiate between what's sacred and what's common. They didn't instruct others to discern clean from unclean things. They hid refused to keep my Sabbaths. "'I'm constantly being profaned among them.
26Ezk 22:27 Her princes within her are like wolves tearing their prey apart. They shed blood, destroying souls, and make unjust gain.
26Ezk 22:28 "'Her prophets whitewashed all of this things through false visions and divine lies. They kept on saying, "This is what the Lord God says¡¦", when the Lord has not spoken.
26Ezk 22:29 The people of the land were vigorously oppressive and took possession of plunder by violence. They've afflicted the poor and the needy and unjustly treated the foreigner.
26Ezk 22:30 I sought for a man among them to build the wall and stand in the breach in my presence on behalf of the land so that it won't be destroyed, but I found no one,
26Ezk 22:31 so I poured my indignation over them. With my fierce anger, I've consumed them. I brought the consequences of their behavior upon them,' declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 23:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 23:2 "Son of Man, here are two sisters who are daughters from the same mother.
26Ezk 23:3 They committed sexual immorality in Egypt. They did this in their youth. There, their breasts were caressed. Their virgin breasts were fondled.
26Ezk 23:4 The older one was named Oholah and her sister was named Oholibah. They belonged to me and gave birth to sons and daughters. Now as to their real identities, Oholah refers to Samaria and Oholibah to Jerusalem."
26Ezk 23:5 "Oholah committed sexual immorality while she belonged to me. She lusted for Assyria warriors
26Ezk 23:6 who were clothed in blue - including governors and commanders. All of them were desirable young men - horsemen mounted on horses.
26Ezk 23:7 She bestowed her sexual favors on them - all of them, the best of the Assyrians - and with whomever she lusted for. "She defiled herself with all their idols.
26Ezk 23:8 She never abandoned the immorality that she practiced in Egypt during her youth, where they laid down with her and fondled her virgin breasts, pouring out their favors all over her.
26Ezk 23:9 Therefore, I delivered her into the control of her lovers, that is, into the control of the Assyrians for whom she lusted.
26Ezk 23:10 They stripped her naked, took away her sons and daughters, and executed her with a sword. She became an object of ridicule among other nations when they punished her." 
26Ezk 23:11 "Her sister Oholibah saw this, but she was more corrupt in her lust and sexual immorality than her sister had been in her own sexual immorality.
26Ezk 23:12 She lusted after the Assyrians-governors, commanders, warriors clothed in gorgeous attire, horsemen mounted on their cavalry - all of them desirable young men.
26Ezk 23:13 I saw that she was defiled, because the two of them both were on the same path. 
26Ezk 23:14 "She increased her rate of sexual immorality when she saw the images of the Chaldean men who had been carved in red on their walls.
26Ezk 23:15 Girded with waistbands around their loins, with flowing turbans on their heads, all of them looked like chariot officers, similar to the Chaldean Babylonians, where they had been born.
26Ezk 23:16 "She lusted after them when she saw them, so she sent messengers to summon them from Chaldea.
26Ezk 23:17 The Babylonians came to her love nest and defiled her with their sexual immorality. As a result, she was defiled by them. Even so, she turned away from them in disgust.
26Ezk 23:18 She displayed her immorality publicly and stripped herself naked, so I turned away in disgust from her, just as I had turned away in disgust from her sister.
26Ezk 23:19 "Nevertheless, she increased the rate of her sexual immorality, even reminiscing about when she was young, when she kept on practicing sexual immorality in the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 23:20 She lusted after her paramours, whose genitals are like those of asses, and whose emissions are like those of horses.
26Ezk 23:21 Think about the wickedness that you practiced when you were young, when the Egyptians fondled your breasts, the breasts of your youth."
26Ezk 23:22 "Therefore, Oholibah, this is what the Lord God says£º 'Look! I'm about to stir up your lovers against you, the ones from whom you've turned away in disgust. I'm going to bring them against you from every direction - 
26Ezk 23:23 the Babylonians, all the Chaldeans, Pekod, Shoa, Koa, and all of the As syrians with them. They're all desirable young men, governors, commanders, chariot officers, and famous men, all of them mounted on horses.
26Ezk 23:24 "'They'll invade you with weapons, chariots, wagons, and a vast army. They'll set themselves in place to attack you from every direction with large shields, small shields, and helmet. I'll turn over judgment to them, and they'll punish you according to their own standards.
26Ezk 23:25 I'll expend my jealousy on you so they'll deal with you in anger. They'll cut off your noses and your ears. Your survivors will die by violence. They'll take your sons and daughters away from you, but your survivors will be incinerated with fire.
26Ezk 23:26 They'll strip off your clothes and confiscate your jewelry.
26Ezk 23:27 That's how I'll put an end to your obscene conduct and sexual immorality that you kept on practicing since the day you left the land of Egypt so that you won't look in their direction or even remember Egypt anymore.'
26Ezk 23:28 "This is what the Lord God says, 'I'm about to deliver you into the control of those you hate, into the control of them from whom you turned away in disgust.
26Ezk 23:29 They'll deal with you with hatred. They'll take away your productivity, leaving you naked and defenseless, so that the nakedness of your sexual immorality will be uncovered-your licentious sexual immorality.
26Ezk 23:30 These things will happen to you because of your sexual immorality that was patterned after after what the nations do. You've been defiled by their idols.
26Ezk 23:31 You took the path of your sister, so I'll place her cup in your hand.'"
26Ezk 23:32 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'You'll drink from your sister's cup, which is both large and deep. You'll become a laughing stock and derision, since it's so full!.
26Ezk 23:33 You'll be filled with drunkenness and grief. The cup that belongs to your sister Samaria is a cup filled with horror and devastation,
26Ezk 23:34 but you'll drink from it and drain it completely. As to the vessel, you'll break it to pieces and you'll tear at your breasts, for I've spoken,' declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 23:35 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º 'Because you abandoned me and threw me behind your back, you will bear the consequences of your obscene conduct and sexual immorality."
26Ezk 23:36 Then the Lord spoke to me. "Son of Man, speak out in judgment of both Ohola and Oholiba. Make their detestable practices widely known,
26Ezk 23:37 because they've committed adultery, and blood coveres their hands. They've also committed adultery with their idols, making their sons born to me to pass through the fire as an offering to them.
26Ezk 23:38 "They've also done this to me£º They defiled my sanctuary and profaned my Sabbaths, all at the same time!
26Ezk 23:39 When they killed their sons as offerings to their idols, time they brought them to my sanctuary and defile it. Look what they've done with my temple!
26Ezk 23:40 "In addition, they sent messengers for men to come from afar. When they arrived, you bathed yourself for them, painted your eyes, decked yourself with jewelry,
26Ezk 23:41 then sat down on an elegant bed. A table was arranged in front of it, on which you set out my incense and oil.
26Ezk 23:42 The sound of a carefree multitude accompanied her. Men from a multitude of peoples were coming-including Sabeans from the wilderness, adorned with bracelets on their hands and beautiful crowns on their heads.
26Ezk 23:43 "After she had worn herself out by her adulterous behavior, I asked her, 'Will they continue with their sexual immorality and with their prostitution?
26Ezk 23:44 They've gone to her, like men do, to have sex with a prostitute. They went in to Oholah and Oholibah, those licentious women.
26Ezk 23:45 Righteous men will judge them with punishment fit for adulterers and with punishment fit for those who shed blod, because they're adulterers with blood on their hands."
26Ezk 23:46 This is what the Lord God says£º "Bring a an army against them and deliver them over to terror and plunder.
26Ezk 23:47 Then the army will stone them with stones and cut them to pieces with their swords. They'll kill their sons and daughters and incinerate their houses. 
26Ezk 23:48 I'll cause obscene conduct to stop throughout the land, because all the women will be admonished not to practice their obscene conduct.
26Ezk 23:49 You'll receive the consequences for your obscene conduct and bear the punishment of your sins of idolatry. Then you'll know that I am the Lord God."
26Ezk 24:1 On the ninth year, in the tenth month, and on the tenth day of the month, this message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 24:2 "Son of Man, write down the name of this day, this very day. The king of Babylon has laid siege to Jerusalem on this very day.
26Ezk 24:3 So compose a parable to the rebellious house. Tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "Prepare your pot for boiling! Set it in place. Fill it up with water, too.
26Ezk 24:4 Gather together the best pieces of meat on it?including the thighs and the shoulders?and fill it with the choicest bones. Take the best bones from the flock, pile wood under the pot for the bones, bring it to a boil, and then cook the bones in it."'"
26Ezk 24:6 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'How terrible it is for that blood-filled city, to the pot whose rust remains in it, whose rust won't come off. Empty it one piece at a time. Don't let a lot fall on it.
26Ezk 24:7 Her blood was in it. She poured it out onto bare rock. She didn't pour it out on the ground, intending to cover it with dirt. In order to stir up my anger And in order to take vengeance, I set the blood on a bare rock so that it cannot be covered.'
26Ezk 24:9 Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º 'How terrible it is for that blood-filled city?I'm also going to add to pile of kindling.
26Ezk 24:10 Pile up the wood! Make the fire burn hot. Boil the meat! Mix the seasonings. Burn those bones to a crisp!
26Ezk 24:11 Make the pot stand empty on the coals until its bronze glows red, its rust can be scoured off, and its dross completely removed.
26Ezk 24:12 The pot wearies me, but its thick rust won't come off, even with fire.
26Ezk 24:13 There is wickedness in your obscene conduct. Even though I've cleansed you, you uncleanness cannot be washed away. You cannot be cleansed again until my rage against you has subsided.'
26Ezk 24:14 I, the Lord have spoken. It will happen, because I'm going to do it. I won't hold back, have compassion, or change my mind. They'll judge you according to your ways and deeds,' declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 24:15 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 24:16 "Son of Man, pay attention! I'm about to take away your most precious treasure with a single, fatal stroke, but you are not to mourn, weep, nor even let tears well up in your eyes.
26Ezk 24:17 You are to weep in silence, but you are not to mourn the dead. You're to keep your turban on your head and your sandals on your feet. You are not to cover your mouth or eat what your comforters bring to you." 
26Ezk 24:18 So I spoke to the people in the morning, and my wife died that evening. The next morning, I did as I had been commanded.
26Ezk 24:19 Then the people said to me, "Explain to us what you're doing should mean to us."
26Ezk 24:20 So I responded, "This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 24:21 'Tell the house of Israel that this is what the Lord God says£º "Look! I'm about to profane my sanctuary, the pride of your strength, the desire of your eyes, and the object of your affection. Your sons and daughters, whom you've left behind, will die by the sword.
26Ezk 24:22 That's why you will soon be doing what I've just done. You are not to cover your mouth or eat what your comforters bring to you.
26Ezk 24:23 Your turbans will be on your heads and your sandals will be on your feet. You won't mourn or weep. Instead, you'll waste away in your sins. Every one of you will groan to his relative.
26Ezk 24:24 That's how Ezekiel will be an example for to you. You'll be doing exactly what he has done. When it happens, then you'll know that I am the Lord God."'2419
26Ezk 24:25 "And now, Son of Man, on the day that I take their strength, joy, and glory from them, those on whom they delight to keep their eyes, the focus of their affection-their sons and daughters - 
26Ezk 24:26 at that time, a fugitive will come to you and will bring you the news.
26Ezk 24:27 Your mouth will freely speak to the fugitive. You won't be silent any longer. You'll be a sign to them. Then they'll know that I am the Lord."
26Ezk 25:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 25:2 "Son of Man, turn your attention to the descendants of Ammon and rebuke them.
26Ezk 25:3 Tell the Ammonites£º 'Listen to a message from the Lord God! This is what the Lord God says£º Because you have said, "Aha!" about my sanctuary when it was desecrated, about the land of Israel when it became desolate, and about the households of Judah when they went into exile,
26Ezk 25:4 therefore you'd better look out! I'm going to give you over to domination by men from the East. You will become their property. They will set up military encampments and permanent places in which to live among you, and then they'll eat your fruit and drink your milk.
26Ezk 25:5 I will turn Rabbah into a pasture for camels, and Ammon will become a resting place for flocks of sheep. That's how they'll learn that I am the Lord.'"
26Ezk 25:6 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'Because you've applauded, stamped your feet, and rejoiced with all sorts of malice in your heart against the land of Israel,
26Ezk 25:7 therefore you'd better watch out! I'm raising a clenched fist in your direction! I'm about to feed you to the surrounding nations as war plunder. I'm going to eliminate you as a nation and kill off those of you who survive to live in other countries. I'm going to destroy you, and that's how you'll learn that I am the Lord.'"
26Ezk 25:8 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'Because Moab and Seir are claiming, "Judah's citizens are just like every other nation,'
26Ezk 25:9 therefore you'd better watch out! I'm going to tear open Moab's flanks, starting with its frontier cities-the very glory of the nation! - including Beth-jeshimoth, Baal-meon, and Kiriathaim.
26Ezk 25:10 I'm going to give these cities over to domination by men from the East. You will become their property. As a result, Ammon will be forgotten as a nation.
26Ezk 25:11 I'm also going to punish Moab, and that's how they'll learn that I am the Lord.'"
26Ezk 25:12 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'Because Edom has made it their practice to seek extraordinary vengeance against Judah's citizens, and by doing so has incurred extraordinary guilt by taking revenge against them,'
26Ezk 25:13 therefore this is what the Lord God says£º 'I'm going to raise my clenched fist in Edom's direction and eliminate every single human being and animal from Edom! I'm going to turn everything into a wasteland, starting with Teman, and Dedan will fall by violence!
26Ezk 25:14 'I'm going to inundate Edom with my retribution, using my people Israel to carry it out! They'll deliver my anger, acting as an agent of my fury. Edom will come to know my vengeance,' declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 25:15 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'Because Philistia has made it their practice to carry out retribution, accompanied by extraordinary malice in their personal vendettas-vendettas that spring from their everlasting hostility - 
26Ezk 25:16 this is what the Lord God says£º "Look out! I'm raising my clenched fist in Philistia's direction. I'm going to execute the Cherethites and destroy what's left of the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.
26Ezk 25:17 I'll take vengeance on them, punishing them severely in my anger. They'll know that I am the Lord when I take my vengeance on them."'"
26Ezk 26:1 During the eleventh year, on the first day of the month of our captivity, this message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 26:2 "Son of Man, because Tyre has been saying about Jerusalem, "The international gateway is broken down, but it's wide open to me! I shall be replenished, now that it lies in ruins!
26Ezk 26:3 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º 'Watch out! I'm coming to get you, Tyre! I'm about to bring many nations to attack you. They'll come in wave after wave, like the breaking tide,
26Ezk 26:4 and will destroy the city walls of Tyre. After they break down her fortified towers, I'll scrape away the city's debris, right down to the bare bedrock,
26Ezk 26:5 and it will become a place where nets will be spread out right in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea. Because I have declared this to happen,' declares the Lord God, 'Tyre will be treated as the spoils of war by the invading nations.
26Ezk 26:6 Furthermore, her citizens who live on the mainland will be executed with swords. That's how they'll learn that I am the Lord.'"
26Ezk 26:7 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'Watch out! I'm about to bring from the north King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, that king of kings. He'll come with horses, chariots, cavalry, and a vast army.
26Ezk 26:8 He'll execute your citizens with swords who live on the mainland. He'll build siege engines to attack you. Then he'll construct siege ramps against you and build huge shields to protect themselves against you.
26Ezk 26:9 'He'll direct the blows of his battering rams against your walls and will breach your fortified towers with axes.
26Ezk 26:10 There will be so many horses that the dust raised by them will cover you completely. The walls of your city will tremble from the noise of Nebuchadnezzar's cavalry, wagons, and chariots when they enter through the gates of your city, as men enter a city that has been breached.
26Ezk 26:11 'Their horses will trample all the public places as he executes your inhabitants with swords. The most fortified of your pillars will be torn to the ground.
26Ezk 26:12 They will plunder your riches and loot your businesses. They'll tear down your walls and demolish your luxurious homes. They'll grab the stones, wood, and rubble from the destruction and dump it all into the Mediterranean Sea.
26Ezk 26:13 'I'll silence the noise of your songs and the music of your harps won't be heard anymore.
26Ezk 26:14 I'll turn you into bare rock, and your city will become a place to spread nets. You will never be built again, because I the Lord have decreed this,' declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 26:15 "This is what the Lord God says to Tyre£º 'When your wounded citizens groan while the slaughter takes place among you, the people who live in the coastlands will tremble in terror as they hear about your fall, will they not - 
26Ezk 26:16 That's when all the kings of the seafaring nations will abandon their thrones, strip off their fancy clothes, and collapse trembling on the ground. They'll be so frightened as they observe what has happened to you that they'll be unable to stop trembling. They will be utterly appalled at you!
26Ezk 26:17 They'll sing this mourning song for you£º "How lost you are, you inhabited city, that was built in the middle of the sea! How famous you were! How strong on the sea! She and her inhabitants inflicted terror to everyone who lived within her."'
26Ezk 26:18 'Now the coastland inhabitants will tremble on the day that you fall. The coastland inhabitants, who make their living from the sea, will be terrified when you pass away!'"
26Ezk 26:19 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'When I turn your city into a ghost town, when I flood you with deep waters that cover you completely,
26Ezk 26:20 I'll make sure that you go straight to the Pit, into the lowest part of the earth, where you'll be with people who lived in ancient times. You'll keep company there with the dead, who have gone into the Pit. As a result, your city won't be inhabited. Meanwhile, I will set my glory in the land of the living.
26Ezk 26:21 I'm going to send terrifying calamity in your direction, and you won't exist any longer. You might be sought after, but you'll never be found again,' declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 27:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 27:2 "Son of Man, compose a mourning song for Tyre.
26Ezk 27:3 Tell Tyre, who lives at the gateway to the Mediterranean Sea, who serves as the international merchant to many coastal districts£º 'This is what the Lord God says£º 'Tyre, you've been claiming, "I am beauty perfected."
26Ezk 27:4 'You've set your national boundary in international waters. Your builders made you downright beautiful!'"
26Ezk 27:5 "'They brought in a ship made with pine planking from Senir, configured with a mast carved from a cedar from Lebanon,
26Ezk 27:6 equipped with oars made from oaks from Bashan, with ivory-inlaid cypress wood decking imported from the coastlands of Cypress,
26Ezk 27:7 with sails made with embroidered Egyption linen, festooned with blue banners, and with your sun shades made with purple cloth from Cypress.
26Ezk 27:8 Your sailors were conscripted from Sidon and Arvad, and your officers served aboard as pilots.
26Ezk 27:9 The wise men and elders from Gebal accompanied you, serving as ship's carpenters. All the martime navies and their seaman also accompanied you to assist you in doing business internationally.'"
26Ezk 27:10 "'Soldiers from Persia, Lud, and Lybia, served in your army. They were your mighty soldiers. Their helmets and shields adorned your barracks walls, and they won battle decorations for you.
26Ezk 27:11 Mercenaries from Arvad and Helech stood guard duty on your walls, while brave men manned your towers. They hung their shields all around your walls?just the right touch to perfect your interior decorating!'"
26Ezk 27:12 "'Tarshish was your business partner because of your phenomenal wealth. They traded silver, iron, tin, and lead for your merchandise.
26Ezk 27:13 Greece, Tubal, and Meshech bartered with you, exchanging slaves and bronze vessels for your wares.
26Ezk 27:14 Beth-togarmah traded horses, war horses, and mules in exchange for what you had to sell.
26Ezk 27:15 Men from the low country south of Edom and many of the coastlands were your markets for ivory tusks and ebony that they brought to trade with you. 
26Ezk 27:16 'Aram was one of your customers because you had so much merchandise. They paid by trading turquoise, purple yarn, embroidered goods, Egyptian linen, coral, and rubies.
26Ezk 27:17 The territories of Judah and Israel were your clients, too. They traded wheat from their distribution centers, baked goods, honey, oil, and ointments for your merchandise. 
26Ezk 27:18 'Because you have so much to sell and are so rich, Damascus has been your trading partner, exchanging wine from Helbon, unbleaced wool,
26Ezk 27:19 and casks of wine from Izal for your wrought iron, cassia wood, and aromatic reeds. 
26Ezk 27:20 'Dedan traded with you, exchanging riding blankets.
26Ezk 27:21 Arabia, including all the princes of Kedar, came to you, shopping for lambs, rams, and goats.
26Ezk 27:22 Traders from Sheba and Raamah paid for the best of what you had to offer with all types of spices, precious stones, and gold.
26Ezk 27:23 'Haran, Canneh, Eden, merchants from Sheba, Asshur, and Chilmad did business with you,
26Ezk 27:24 trading garments made into the finest blue and embroidered mantels, and also multi-colored carpets, ropes, and other merchandize.
26Ezk 27:25 Ocean-going fleets carried your merchandise. How filled you were! How glorious you were, at home in the heart of the sea!
26Ezk 27:26 But your rowers have brought you into dangerous waters. The east wind has broken you in the heart of the ocean!
26Ezk 27:27 Your wealth, your products, your merchandize your sailors, your pilots, your tailors, your salesmen, all your mercenaries with you?your entire company with you?will fall into the midst of the sea on the day when you're overthrown!
26Ezk 27:28 When your ships' captains cry out, the pasturelands along the coast will cry out!
26Ezk 27:29 Everyone who handles the oar will abandon ship, they'll head straight for dry land,
26Ezk 27:30 and they will cry so loud you won't be able to make yourself be heard! How bitterly they'll cry! They'll throw dust on their heads and wallow in ashes.
26Ezk 27:31 They'll shave their heads bald because of you. They'll dress themselves in sackcloth and weep for you with deep bitterness of heart, with the most pitiful of mourning.
26Ezk 27:32 In the depth of their despair they'll compose a lament for you. This is what they'll say£º 'Who is like Tyre?Who is so silent in the midst of the sea - 
26Ezk 27:33 Your merchandize went out over the oceans to satisfy many nations; with the abundance of your wealth you enriched the kings of the earth.'
26Ezk 27:34 But now it's your time to be wrecked at the bottom of the sea! Your products and your workers have sunk, and so have you!
26Ezk 27:35 Everyone who lives by the sea is appalled at your destruction. Their leaders are terrified?their faces reflect their fears!
26Ezk 27:336 Traders circulate among the people, hissing at you. What a horror you've become! Now you will cease to exist forever and ever!
26Ezk 28:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 28:2 "Son of Man, tell Tyre's commander-in-chief, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "Because your heart is arrogant, and because you keep saying, 'I have taken my seat, I am a god, seated in God's seat right in the middle of the sea,' "and because you're a man, and not a god, even though you pretend that you have a god-like heart¡¦
26Ezk 28:3 Look! You're wiser than Daniel, aren't you?No secret is too mysterious for you!
26Ezk 28:4 Your wisdom and understanding brought you phenomenal wealth. You've brought gold and silver into your treasuries.
26Ezk 28:5 By your great wisdom, by your skills in trading you have amassed wealth for yourself and your heart has become arrogant because of your wealth."'"
26Ezk 28:6 'Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º "Because you've made your heart like that of God
26Ezk 28:7 Therefore, look! I'm bringing foreigners in your direction, the most terrifying of nations! They will direct their violence against the grandeur that you've created by your wisdom.
26Ezk 28:8 They'll send you down to the Pit, and you'll die defiled in the depths of the sea.
26Ezk 28:9 Is that when you'll say "I'm God" to the face of those who will be killing you?After all, you're a man, and have never been a god, especially when you're under the control of those who will defile you!
26Ezk 28:10 You will die a death fit for the uncircumcised at the hand of foreigners." 'for I have said it will be so,' declares the Lord."
26Ezk 28:11 Another message came to me from the Lord, and this is what it said£º 
26Ezk 28:12 "Son of Man, start singing this lamentation for the king of Tyre. Tell him, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "You served as my model, my example of complete wisdom and perfect beauty.
26Ezk 28:13 You used to be in Eden?God's paradise! You wore precious stones for clothing£º ruby, topaz, diamond, beryl, onyx, jasper, sapphire, turquoise, and carbuncle. Your settings were crafted in gold, along with your engravings. On the day of your creation they had been prepared!
26Ezk 28:14 "You were the anointed cherub; having been set in place on the holy mountain of God, you walked in the midst of fiery stones.
26Ezk 28:15 You were blameless in your behavior from the day you were created until wickedness was discovered in you.
26Ezk 28:16 In the vastness of your trade that filled you with violence from top to bottom you sinned, so I cast you away as defiled from the mountain of God. I destroyed you, you guardian cherub, from the midst of the fiery stones.
26Ezk 28:17 Your heart grew arrogant because of your beauty; you annihilated your own wisdom because of your splendor. Then I threw you to the ground in the presence of kings, giving them a good look at you!
26Ezk 28:18 By all of your iniquity and unrighteous businesses you defiled your sanctuaries, so I'm going to bring out fire from within you and burn you to ashes on the earth before the whole watching world!
26Ezk 28:19 Everyone who knows you throughout all the nations will be appalled at your calamity and you shall no longer exist forever."'"
26Ezk 28:20 Another message came to me from the Lord, who had this to say£º 
26Ezk 28:21 "Son of Man, turn your attention to Sidon and prophesy against her.
26Ezk 28:22 Tell her£º 'Pay attention to me, Sidon! I'm against you, and I'm going to glorify myself right in your midst.' They'll learn that I am the Lord when I bring about these punishments and manifest my holiness in her midst.
26Ezk 28:23 I'm going to send disease into that city and blood into her streets. People will drop dead in her midst from the violence done to her from every side. Then they'll learn that I am the Lord God.'"
26Ezk 28:24 "The house of Israel will never again suffer from painful briers and sharp thornbushes that surround them on every side, and they will learn that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 28:25 This is what the Lord God says£º 'When I gather the house of Israel from the nations to which I've scattered them, I will show them my holiness before the watching world, and they will live on the land that I have to my servant Jacob.
26Ezk 28:26 They will live in safety in the land, building houses and planting vineyards. They'll live in safety while I administer judgment on everyone who maligns them among those who surround them. At that time they'll learn that I am the Lord their God.'"
26Ezk 29:1 In the tenth year, on the twelfth day of the tenth month, a message came to me from the Lord, who had this to say£º 
26Ezk 29:2 "Son of Man, turn your attention to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and prophesy against him and the entire nation of Egypt.
26Ezk 29:3 Tell him that this is what the Lord God says£º 'Watch out! I'm coming to get you, Pharaoah, king of Egypt! You big monster! You lay in wait in the middle of your waterways and say "My waterways belong to me! I made them for myself!"
26Ezk 29:4 'So I'm going to plant a hook in your jaw and make the fish in your waterways grab hold of your scales. I'll bring you up out of the middle of your waterways, along with all of the fish from your waterways that cling to your scales,
26Ezk 29:5 Then I'll fling you out into the desert, you and all those fish in your waterways. You'll fall out in the open fields; you'll never be reunited. I'm giving you to the wild beasts of the earth and to the birds of the sky, and they will dine on you!
26Ezk 29:6 'Then everyone living in Egypt will know that I am the Lord, because they have been an unreliable ally to the house of Israel.
26Ezk 29:7 When they reached out to you for support, you tore their hands and dislocated all of their shoulders. When they tried to lean on you. all of their loins became unstable.'
26Ezk 29:8 'Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º "Look out! I'm bringing violent death in your direction! I'm going to kill every person and animal,
26Ezk 29:9 and the land of Egypt will be turned into a desolate ruin. Then you will know that I am the Lord. "Because Egypt said, 'The Nile is mine. I made it!'
26Ezk 29:10 therefore watch out! I'm coming to get you! I'm going to attack your waterways, and then I'm going to make the land of Egypt a total wasteland from the Aswan fortress to the border of Ethiopia!
26Ezk 29:11 Neither man nor beast will walk through that area. It won't even be inhabited for 40 years.
26Ezk 29:12 I'll see to it that Egypt becomes a devastated land in the midst of devastated lands. Her cities deep inside her territories will be laid waste and desolate for 40 years. I will scatter Egypt among the nations and disperse them throughout the land.
26Ezk 29:13 "Because this is what the Lord says£º 'At the end of 40 years I'll gather the Egyptians from the people among whom they have been scattered.
26Ezk 29:14 I'll restore the economy of Egypt and return them to the land of Pathros, from which they originated, and there they will remain an insignificant kingdom,
26Ezk 29:15 the least significant of kingdoms. It will never again dominate other nations. I will make them so small that they will never again rule any nation.
26Ezk 29:16 Egypt will never again be a source of confidence to the nation of Israel. Instead, Egypt will serve as a reminder of when they sinned by turning to Egypt for help. Then they'll know that I am the Lord God.'"
26Ezk 29:17 On the first day of the first month of the twenty-seventh year of our captivity, a message from the Lord came to me. It had this to say£º 
26Ezk 29:18 "Son of Man, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, made his army work very hard to attack Tyre. They tore their hair out and rubbed their shoulders raw! Despite all of that work trying to capture Tyre, neither he nor his army got paid from Tyre for all that!
26Ezk 29:19 Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º 'Im going to give the land of Egypt to King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon. He's going to carry off Egypt's wealth, capture her war implements, confiscate her plunder, and use it to pay wages for his army!
26Ezk 29:20 I've given him the land of Egypt as a reward for attacking Tyre for me," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 29:21 "When that day comes about, I'll strengthen Israel's military might, and I will give you an audience in their midst. Then they will know that I am the Lord.'"
26Ezk 30:1 Another message came to me from the Lord, who had this to say£º 
26Ezk 30:2 "Son of Man, here's what you are to prophesy and announce, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "Wail out loud! Oh no! The day!
26Ezk 30:3 "For comes now the day?comes now the day of the Lord, the day of clouds! The time of the gentiles is fulfilled.
26Ezk 30:4 War shall come into Egypt, and Ethiopia will be in anguish when the slain fall in Egypt, when her wealth is carried off, and her foundations are demolished."
26Ezk 30:5 "Ethiopia, Lybia, descendants of Lud, all those who have mixed themselves, and Lybia - along with everyone in the land of Israel who is in league with them - will die violently.
26Ezk 30:6 "This is what the Lord says£º 'Those who are supporting Egypt will fall; her majestic strength will collapse from the Aswan fortress by the sword that invades her,' declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 30:7 "They'll remain desolate among desolate lands, their cities will be named among those that are ruined.
26Ezk 30:8 They will know that I am the Lord when I kindle my fire in Egypt and all who help her are crushed.'
26Ezk 30:9 "When that happens, couriers will go out in ships to terrify Ethiopia in its complacency. Anguish will visit them as it will visit Egypt. Watch out! It's coming!
26Ezk 30:10 "This is what the Lord says£º 'I'm putting an end to that gang from Egypt, and I'm going to use Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, to do it!
26Ezk 30:11 He and his ruthless army with him will be brought to destroy the land. They'll draw their swords and attack Egypt, filling the land with the dead!
26Ezk 30:12 I'll dry up their waterways and sell off the land by means of evil men. I'm going to make that land desolate, along with everything that's in it, and I'm going to do that by the hand of foreigners. I, the Lord have spoken!'
26Ezk 30:13 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'I will destroy the idols and put an end to the images that come from Memphis. There will no longer be a prince from the land of Egypt, and I will make the land of Egypt to become terrified.
26Ezk 30:14 I'm going to turn Pathros into a desolation set fire to Zoan, and judge Thebes.
26Ezk 30:15 I'll pour out my anger on Sin, Egypt's strong fortress, and I'll eliminate the gangs in Thebes.
26Ezk 30:16 I'll set fire to Egypt, and Syene will write in agony. Thebes will be demolished, and Memphis will face daily distress.
26Ezk 30:17 The young men of On and Pi-beseth will die violently, and their cities will be taken captive.
26Ezk 30:18 It will be a dark day for Tahpanhes when I break the yokes of Egypt. That's when her arrogant power will come to an end. She'll be covered by a cloud, and her citizens will go into captivity.
26Ezk 30:19 I will carry out my judgments on Egypt, and they will learn that I am the Lord.'"
26Ezk 30:20 On the seventh day of the first month of the eleventh year of our captivity, a message came to me from the Lord. It had this to say£º 
26Ezk 30:21 "Son of Man, I've broken the arm of Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Look! It hasn't been set in a splint for healing or wrapped with a bandage so it could be strong enough to hold a sword!
26Ezk 30:22 Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º 'I'm coming to attack Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and I'm gong to break both of his arms, the strong one and the wounded one. That will make him drop his sword.
26Ezk 30:23 I'm going to scatter Egypt throughout the surrounding nations and disperse them throughout the world.
26Ezk 30:24 'I'm going to strengthen the military might of the king of Babylon, put my own sword in his hand, and break Pharaoah's strength. Then Pharaoh will groan like a dying man right in front of the king of Babylon.
26Ezk 30:25 'When I strengthen the military might of Babylon, the military might of Pharaoah will fail, and then they will learn that I am the Lord when I place my own sword in the hand of the king of Babylon. He will attack the land of Egypt.
26Ezk 30:26 When I scatter the Egyptians among the nations and disperse them throughout the world, they will learn that I am the Lord.'"
26Ezk 31:1 On the first day of the third month of the eleventh year of our captivity, this message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 31:2 "Son of Man, tell this to Pharaoh, king of Egypt and his gangs£º 'Who do you think you are?What makes you so great - 
26Ezk 31:3 Think about Assyria, that cedar of Lebanon, beautiful with its branches, like a shady forest, awesome in its height, its summit touches the clouds.
26Ezk 31:4 Plentiful water made it great, Subterranean rivers made it grow. Rivers surrounded the area where it had been planted, and water channels nourished all the trees in the fields.
26Ezk 31:5 That's why it grew taller than any of the trees in the fields. Its boughs flourished. Its branches grew luxurious because of all the water that made it spread out.
26Ezk 31:6 The birds in the sky made nests in its boughs; all the beasts of the field gave birth under its branches. All the great nations rested in its shade.
26Ezk 31:7 'Beautiful by virtue of its greatness, with its long branches, it was rooted in many waters.
26Ezk 31:8 The cedars in God's garden could not compare to it; Fir trees could not match its boughs. The plane tree never grew branches like it, and no tree in God's garden compares to its beauty.
26Ezk 31:9 I made it beautiful with all of its branches; all the trees in God's garden of Eden envied it!'"
26Ezk 31:10 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º 'Because of its towering height, with its summit reaching into the clouds, and because it was haughty in its position,
26Ezk 31:11 I turned it over to domination by the leader of those nations, who dealt with it thoroughly. I have driven it away because of its wickedness.
26Ezk 31:12 'Foreign dictators have trimmed it down to size and abandoned it. Its branches have fallen off on mountains and in all the valleys. Its boughts have broken off in all the ravines of the land. All the nations of the earth have moved out of its shade and abandoned it.
26Ezk 31:13 All the birds in the sky will live among its ruins, and the wild animals will forage among its branches.
26Ezk 31:14 'As a result, none of its watered trees will grow tall, their tops will never reach to the clouds, and they'll never grow so high again, because all of them have been appointed to death in the world beneath where human beings go, that is, down to the Pit.'"
26Ezk 31:15 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'On the day that it descended into Sheol, I shut down its water supplies, covered over its deep water, and shut down its rivers. As a result its abundant water sources dried up, and I caused Lebanon to mourn for it. All the trees of the field wilted because of it.
26Ezk 31:16 I made the nations tremble when they heard that Assyria was falling, descending into Sheol to join those who go down into the Pit. Then all of the trees of Eden in the world below were comforted, including the choicest and best of Lebanon, all of whom were well-watered.
26Ezk 31:17 They also went down with it into Sheol, to those who had been killed violently and to those who had trusted in its strength by living in its shadow among the nations.'
26Ezk 31:18 'So tell me now, which of the trees of Eden compares to you in glory or greatness?Nevertheless, you'll be brought down, along with those trees of Eden, to the earth below. You'll lie in the middle of the uncircumcised, with those who have been killed in war. Pharaoh and all his gang will be just like this!'" declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 32:1 On the first day of the twelfth month of the twelfth year of our captivity, a message came to me from the Lord that had this to say£º 
26Ezk 32:2 "Son of Man, start singing this lamentation about Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Tell him, 'You may have called yourself a lion among nations, but you're a monster at sea. You thrash about in your rivers, muddy the water with your feet, and relieve yourself in the rivers.'
26Ezk 32:3 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'I'm coming fishing for you! Right in the sight of many nations they'll haul you up in my dragnet.
26Ezk 32:4 I'll fling you up onto the land; I'll haul you onto the surface of the field, I'll make every carrion eating bird come to dine on you, and I'll make all the scavenging animals gorge themselves on you.
26Ezk 32:5 I'll cover the mountains with your flesh and fill their valleys with your rotting carcass.
26Ezk 32:6 I'll drench the land with your bloodflow right up to the mountains, and the ravines will overflow with blood that comes from you!
26Ezk 32:7 When I put out your lights, I'll cover the heavens and darken their stars. I'll cover the sun with a cloud and the moon won't reflect its light.
26Ezk 32:8 I'll darken the bright lights in the sky above you and bring darkness to your territory,' declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 32:9 "I'll bring distress to the hearts of many nations when I bring about your destruction among nations whose territories you have not known.
26Ezk 32:10 I'll make many nations be appalled at you, and their kings will be terrified because of you when I brandish my sword right in their face. They will all tremble from fear for their own safety on the day that you fall! 
26Ezk 32:11 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'The army of the king of Babylon will attack you.
26Ezk 32:12 I'm going to make your gangs die using the weapons of valiant warriors, all of whom are ruthless people. 'They will devastate the majesty of Egypt, destroying all of its hordes.
26Ezk 32:13 I'm going to destroy all of its livestock along its many riverbanks. Human feet won't muddy the rivers anymore, nor will the hooves of livestock churn the water.
26Ezk 32:14 That's when I'll make their waterways flow smoothly, and their rivers flow like olive oil,' declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 32:15 'When I turn the land of Egypt into a desolation, and the land is emptied of everything that used to fill it, when I strike everything who lives there, they will learn that I am the Lord.'"
26Ezk 32:16 "This has been a lamentation. They will chant it, and the citizens of the nations will chant it, too. They'll chant it about Egypt and about all of its hordes."
26Ezk 32:17 In the twelfth year, on the fifteen day of the first month of our captivity, a message from the Lord came to me, and this is what it said:
26Ezk 32:18 "Son of Man, mourn about the hordes of Egypt. Bring them down-that is, her and the citizens of those majestic nations-whose destiny is the deep part of the Pit.
26Ezk 32:19 "So who's more beautiful than you?You'll be buried with the uncircumcised.
26Ezk 32:20 "They'll die along with others who are killed violently. Egypt has been given over to violence, which will carry off both it and its hordes."
26Ezk 32:21 "Mighty leaders will address them and those who assist them right out of the midst of Sheol£º 'They've come down and will lie still, these uncircumcised people who have died violently.'
26Ezk 32:22 "Assyria will be there, along with all of those who keep company with her, all of them killed violently.
26Ezk 32:23 Her grave will be set in the remotest part of the Pit, surrounded by those who accompanied her. All of them will have been killed, executed by violence, who spread terror throughout the land of the living.
26Ezk 32:24 "Elam will be there. Its hordes will surround its grave. All of them have been killed. They fell violently, and they have descended uncircumcised into the world below after having spread terror throughout the land of the living. They will bear the shame of those who descend to the Pit.
26Ezk 32:25 "They have prepared a bed for her and for her hordes that surround her graves. All of them are uncircumcised, having been killed by violence, because they had spread terror throughout the land of the living. They will bear the shame of those who descend to the Pit and will take their place among the dead.
26Ezk 32:26 "Meshech and Tubal will be there, along with all of the hordes that surround her grave. Every one of them is uncircumcised, killed by violence, because they spread terror throughout the land of the living.
26Ezk 32:27 "They won't be buried with dead warriors from ancient times, who went straight to Sheol, buried with their war weapons, with their swords placed under their heads and their shields laid on top of their bones, since they spread terror throughout the land of the living.
26Ezk 32:28 You'll be broken, and you'll lie down with the uncircumcised who died by violence.
26Ezk 32:29 "Edom will be there, along with its kings and princes who despite all their power have been killed violently. They, too, lie with the uncircumcised; that is, with those who descend into the Pit.
26Ezk 32:30 "All of the princes from the North are there, along with the Sidonians, who have gone down in shame to join those who have been killed because of all the terror they caused by their military might. They lie uncircumcised with those who have been killed violently. They will bear their shame, along with those who descend into the Pit.
26Ezk 32:31 "When Pharaoh sees them, he will take comfort in his hordes. Pharaoah and all his army will die by violence," says the Lord God,
26Ezk 32:32 "because he spread terror throughout the land of the living. Therefore he'll be laid to rest among the uncircumcised, who have been killed violently; that is, Pharaoh and all of his hordes," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 33:1 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 33:2 "Son of Man, speak to your nation's children and tell them£º "'If I bring war to a land, and the people of that land appoint one of their conscripted men to serve as a sentinel,
26Ezk 33:3 and if he notices that violence is approaching and sounds an alarm to warn the people,
26Ezk 33:4 then if anyone who hears the sound of the alarm does not heed the warning, when the violence arrives and destroys him, his shed blood will remain his own responsibility.
26Ezk 33:5 After all, he heard the alarm sounding, but did not heed the warning, so his shed blood will remain his own responsibility. If he had heeded the warning, he would have saved himself.
26Ezk 33:6 If that sentinel notices that violence is approaching, but does not sound an alarm, then because the nation does not take warning and the violence arrives and destroys their lives because of their guilt, I'll seek retribution for their shed blood from the one who was acting as sentinel.'"
26Ezk 33:7 "'Now as for you, Son of Man, I've established you as a sentinel for the house of Israel. So whenever you hear a message from me, you are to warn them from me.
26Ezk 33:8 If I should say to a certain wicked person, "You wicked man, you're certainly about to die," but you don't warn him to turn from his wicked behavior, he'll die in his guilt, but I'll seek retribution for his bloodshed from you.
26Ezk 33:9 However, if you warn the wicked to turn from his behavior and he does not do so, he will die in his guilt, and you will have saved yourself.'"
26Ezk 33:10 "'Now, Son of Man, tell this to the house of Israel£º "'You keep saying, "Our crimes and sins burden us so much that we're rotting away, so how can we keep on living?
26Ezk 33:11 "'Tell them, "As certainly as I'm alive and living," declares the Lord God, "I receive no pleasure in the death of the wicked. Instead, my pleasure is that the wicked repent from their behavior and live. Turn back! Turn back, all of you, from your wicked behavior! Why do you have to die, you house of Israel - 
26Ezk 33:12 "'And now, Son of Man, say this to your people£º "The righteousness of the righteous won't save them when they keep on committing crimes against me, the wickedness of the wicked won't keep them from remaining away when they're turning from their wickeness, and no righteous person shall keep living by their righteousness when they sin.
26Ezk 33:13 "If I tell the righteous that they will certainly live, if he trusts in his own righteousness and commits evil, none of his righteousness will be remembered, and he will die because of the wrong that he commits.
26Ezk 33:14 "If I tell the wicked that he will certainly die, if he turns from his sin and acts with justice and righteousness,
26Ezk 33:15 returning what has been placed as collateral for a loan, paying back what he has taken, following the regulations that demonstrate life, and committing no iniquity, he will certainly live, and not die.
26Ezk 33:16 None of the sins that he has committed will be remembered against him. In having done what is just and right, he will certainly live.
26Ezk 33:17 "Nevertheless, your people's children keep saying, 'The Lord's way of behaving isn't right,' when all the while it is their way of behaving that isn't right.
26Ezk 33:18 When a righteous man forsakes his own righteousness and commits evil acts, he will die because of those acts,
26Ezk 33:19 and when the wicked turn away from their wickedness and do what is just and right, he will certainly live because of that.
26Ezk 33:20 "And yet you keep saying, 'The Lord's way of behaving isn't right.' But I will judge every one of you according to his behavior, you house of Israel!"'"
26Ezk 33:21 On the fifth day of the tenth month of the twelfth year of our captivity, a fugitive who had escaped from Jerusalem came and informed me, "The city has been destroyed."
26Ezk 33:22 Now the hand of the Lord had been touching me the evening before that fugitive arrived, so the Lord had given me something to say by the time the messenger arrived the next morning. He opened my mouth and I no longer had nothing to say to him.
26Ezk 33:23 As a result, this message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 33:24 "Son of Man, those who are living among these ruins of the land of Israel keep saying, 'Abraham was only one man, but he was able to possess the land! As for us, we're a multitude, and the land has been given to us as an inheritance.'
26Ezk 33:25 "So tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "You keep eating flesh along with its blood, you keep looking to your idols, and you keep shedding blood, and you're going to take possession of the land - 
26Ezk 33:26 You keep trusting in your weapons, you continue to commit loathsome things, men keep defiling their neighbors' wives, and you're going to take possession of the land - 
26Ezk 33:27 "Tell them this£º 'This is what the Lord God says£º "As certainly as I'm alive and living, those who live in the wastelands are certain to die violently, I'll give those who die in the open fields to the wild animals for food, and whoever takes refuge in caves and fortified places will die of diseases.
26Ezk 33:28 Then I'll turn the land into a desolate ruin and her arrogant strength will come to an abrupt end. The mountains of Israel will become so desolate than no one will be able to travel over them.
26Ezk 33:29 Then they'll learn that I am the Lord, when I've turned their land into a desolate wasteland because of all of the loathsome things that they've done."'
26Ezk 33:30 "Now as for you, Son of Man, your nation's children keep gathering together to talk about you beside the walls and at the doorway to their houses. Everyone tells one another, 'Please come! Let's go hear what the Lord has to say!'
26Ezk 33:31 Then they come to you as a group, sit down right in front of you as if they were my people, hear your words-and then they don't do what you say?because they taste only their own desires, they pursue ill-gotten profits, and they keep following their own self-interests.
26Ezk 33:32 As far as they are concerned, you sing romantic songs with a beautiful voice and play a musical instrument well. They'll listen to what you have to say, but they won't put it into practice!
26Ezk 33:33 When all of this comes about-and you can be sure that it will! - they'll learn that a prophet has been in their midst."
26Ezk 34:1 A message came from the Lord for me, and it had this to say£º 
26Ezk 34:2 "Son of Man, prophesy against Israel's shepherds. Tell those shepherds, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "Woe to you shepherds of Israel who have been feeding yourselves and not the sheep. Shouldn't shepherds feed the sheep - 
26Ezk 34:3 You're eating the best parts, clothing yourselves with the weel, and slaughtering the home-grown sheep without having fed the sheep!
26Ezk 34:4 You haven't strengthened the weak, treated the sick, set broken bones, regathered the scattered, or looked for the lost. Instead, you've dominated them with brutal force and ruthlessness.
26Ezk 34:5 "Since they have no shepherd, they have been scattered around and have become prey for all sorts of wild animals. How scattered they are!
26Ezk 34:6 My sheep have gone wandering on all of the mountains, on all of the hills, and throughout every high place on the surface of the whole world, with no one to look for them or go out in search of them.
26Ezk 34:7 "Therefore listen to what the Lord says, you shepherds£º 
26Ezk 34:8 'As certainly as I'm alive and living, my sheep have truly become victims, food for all of the wild animals because there are no shepherds. My shepherds did not go searching for my flock. Instead, the shepherds fed themselves, and my flock they would not feed!'
26Ezk 34:9 "Therefore, you shepherds, listen to what the Lord says£º 'Watch out, I'm coming after you shepherds! I'm going to demand my sheep back from them and fire them as shepherds. The shepherds won't be shepherds anymore when I snatch my flock right out their mouths so they can't be eaten by them anymore.'"
26Ezk 34:11 "This is what the Lord says£º 'Watch me! I'm going to search for my flock. I'll watch over them myself.
26Ezk 34:12 Just as a shepherd looks after his flock during the day time while he is with them, so also I'm going to watch over my sheep, delivering them from every place where they've been scattered during the times of gloom and doom.
26Ezk 34:13 I'm going to bring them out from foreign nations and from foreign lands. Then I'll bring them to their own land and feed them in Israel - on the mountains, in their valleys, and in all of their settlements throughout the land.
26Ezk 34:14 "'I'll feed them in excellent pastures, and even the very heights of Israel's mountains will serve as verdant pastures for them in which they'll rest and feed - yes, even on the fertile mountains of Israel!
26Ezk 34:15 I will feed my sheep and make them be at rest,' declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 34:16 "'I'm going to seek both the lost as well as the scattered, and bring them both back so their broken bones can be set and the sick can be healed. But I'll exterminate the far and the stiff-necked in righteousness.
26Ezk 34:17 "Now as for you, my flock, this is what the Lord God says£º 'Watch out! I'm going to judge between one sheep and another, and between the rams and the goats.
26Ezk 34:18 Is it such an insignificant thing to you that you're feeding in good pastures but trampling down the other pastures with your feet?Or that you as you're drinking from the clear strems you're muddying the rest with your feet - 
26Ezk 34:19 My flock is grazing on what you've been treading down with your feet and they're drinking what you've been making muddy with your feet!'
26Ezk 34:20 "Therefore this is what the Lord God says to them£º 'Watch me! I'm going to judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep,
26Ezk 34:21 since you've been bumping aside all the weaker sheep with your backsides and shoulders, butting them with your horns until they're scattered around outside.
26Ezk 34:22 That's how I'll save my sheep so they won't be plundered any longer. I'm going to judge between one sheep and another.'"
26Ezk 34:23 "'Then I'll install one shepherd for them-my servant David-and he will feed them, will be there for them, and will serve as their shepherd.
26Ezk 34:24 I, the Lord, will be their God, and my servant David will rule among them as Prince.' I, the Lord, have spoken this.
26Ezk 34:25 "I'm going to enter into a covenant with them, one of peace, and I'll eliminate wild beasts from the land so they can live securely in the wilderness and sleep in the forests.
26Ezk 34:26 I'm going to make them and everything that surrounds my hill a blessing. I'll send down the rain! At the appropriate time there will be a rainstorm of blessing!
26Ezk 34:27 "I'll bring fruit to the trees in the fields, the land will yield its produce, they will live securely on their land, and they will learn that I am the Lord when I break the bar that has been their yoke and deliver them from the control of those who have enslaved them.
26Ezk 34:28 They will no longer be plundered by the nations, and wild animals that live on the earth will no longer devour them. They will settle down in confidence with nothing to frighten them.
26Ezk 34:29 I'm going to prepare for them the best of gardening spots. They will no longer live as victims in a land of starvation, nor will they have to bear the insults of the international community.
26Ezk 34:30 That's when they'll learn that I, the Lord their God, am with them, and that they, the house of Israel, are my people,' declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 34:31 "And as for you, my sheep, the flock that I'm pasturing, you are mankind, and I am your God," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 35:1 A message came to me from the Lord and it went like this£º 
26Ezk 35:2 "Son of Man, turn your attention toward Mount Seir and begin to prophesy against it.
26Ezk 35:3 Tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "Watch out! I'm coming to get you, Mount Seir! I'm stretching out my hand to strike you, and I'm going to turn you into a desolate wasteland.
26Ezk 35:4 I'm going to turn your cities into ghost towns, and you will become a ruin. Then you will learn that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 35:5 Because of your undying hatred, you kept on delivering the Israelites to violent abuse during the time of their calamity, even when they were in their final stages of punishment,
26Ezk 35:6 therefore as I'm alive and living," declares the Lord God, I'm turning you over to bloodshed, and bloodshed will certainly overtake you, since you never have hated shedding blood. That's why bloodshed will certainly pursue you.
26Ezk 35:7 "I'm turning Mount Seir over to ruin and desolation. I'm going to eliminate everyone who comes and goes,
26Ezk 35:8 and I'll fill his mountain with the dead. Those who die by violence will cover your hills, and fill your valleys and all your ravines!
26Ezk 35:9 I will turn you into an everlasting wasteland, and your cities will never be inhabited. Then you'll learn that I am the Lord!
26Ezk 35:10 "Because you have claimed, 'These two nations and these two lands are going to belong to me, and we will take possession of them, even though the Lord is there,'
26Ezk 35:11 therefore as I'm alive and living" declares the Lord God, "I'm going to deal with you as your anger deserves. When I judge you, I'll treat you like you did them-that is, with the same kind of envy that motivated your constant hatred against them.
26Ezk 35:12 "That's how you'll know that I, the Lord, have heard every loathsome, reviling thing that you've had to say against the mountains of Israel, such as 'They're desolate, and we'll eat them for dinner!'
26Ezk 35:13 Not only that, you've arrogantly reviled me many times over, and I've heard every word!
26Ezk 35:14 "So this is what the Lord God says£º 'Just as the earth rejoices, I'm going to turn you into a desolate wasteland.
26Ezk 35:15 Just as you rejoiced when Israel's inheritance became desolate, I'm going to do the same thing to you. Mount Seir, you and Edom-all of you-will become a desolate wasteland.' Then they will learn that I am the Lord."'"
26Ezk 36:1 "And now as for you, Son of Man, prophesy to Israel's mountains and tell them, 'Listen to this message from the Lord, you mountains of Israel:
26Ezk 36:2 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'The enemy has been saying about you, "Good! The ancient heights are back in our possession!"
26Ezk 36:3 Therefore this is what you are to prophesy£º "Here's what the Lord God says, 'You've been turned into a desolate wasteland and crushed by everyone who surrounds you for a very, very good reason. You've become the property of all the other nations and you've become the object of gossip and whispering campaigns of the nations.
26Ezk 36:4 "Therefore listen to what the Lord God has to say, you mountains of Israel£º This is what the Lord God says to the mountains, to the hills, to the waterways, to the valleys, to the desolate wastelands, and to the abandoned cities that have become a target of derision to the mountains that surround you£º 
26Ezk 36:5 "'Because this is what the Lord God says£º "Motivated by my burning zealousness, I have spoken againt the rest of the surrounding nations, including Edom, who confiscated my land, taking possession of it with joyful enthusiasm and with animal-like malice, in order to plunder Israel's pastures.
26Ezk 36:6 "Therefore prophesy concerning the land of Israel and speak to its mountains, hills, ravines, and valleys. Tell them 'This is what the Lord God says£º "Pay attention! In my zealous anger I'm speaking because you've had to endure the mockery of the world's nations."
26Ezk 36:7 'Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º "I hereby raise my hand to swear this oath£º the nations that surround you will have their own mockery to endure!
26Ezk 36:8 But you mountains of Israel are going to sprout branches and bear fruit for my people Israel, because they'll be coming soon.
26Ezk 36:9 "Watch me! I'm on your side! I'll be turning in your direction, and you mountains will be plowed and planted.
26Ezk 36:10 I'm going to make the entire house of Israel grow-every single member-and their cities will be inhabited with all the ruins rebuilt.
26Ezk 36:11 I'll make both the population and the livestock increase throughout your territories. They'll increase and be fruitful. I'll make your territories to be settled like you were in the past, and you will be treated better than you ever were before. At that time you will know that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 36:12 "I'll lead my people, my nation of Israel, across you mountains, and they will take possession of you again, and you'll be their inheritance once more. Never again will you leave them robbed of children.
26Ezk 36:13 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'Because some have been saying to you, "You mountains have been devouring human beings and leaving people childless,"
26Ezk 36:14 'therefore you will no longer devour human beings or leave their nation childless,' declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 36:15 'I won't let you hear other people mock you, and no nation will ever make you childless again,' declares the Lord God. 
26Ezk 36:16 This message came to me from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 36:17 "Son of Man, when the house of Israel was living on their own land, they defiled it with their lifestyles and behavior; they were as disqualified to be with me as a menstruating woman is to you.
26Ezk 36:18 So I poured out my anger on them because of all the bloodshed throughout the land and because they had defiled it with their idolatry.
26Ezk 36:19 Then I scattered them among the nations, dispersing them to other lands, just as their lifestyles and behavior deserved. That's how I judged them.
26Ezk 36:20 Nevertheless, when they arrived in those nations, they continued to profane my holy name. It was said about them, 'These are the Lord's people, even though they've left his land.'
26Ezk 36:21 I've been concerned about my holy reputation, which the house of Israel has been defiling throughout all of the nations where they've gone.
26Ezk 36:22 "Therefore tell the house of Israel, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "I'm not about to act for your sake, you house of Israel, but for the sake of my holy reputation, which you have been defiling throughout all of the nations where you've gone.
26Ezk 36:23 I'm going to affirm my great reputation that has been defiled among the nations (that is, that you have defiled in their midst), and those people will learn that I am the Lord," declares the Lord God, 'when I affirm my holiness in front of their very eyes.
26Ezk 36:24 I'm going to remove you from the nations, gather you from all of the territories, and bring you all back to your own land.
26Ezk 36:25 I'll sprinkle pure water on you all, and you'll be cleansed from your impurity and from all of your idols.
26Ezk 36:26 "I'm going to give you a new heart, and I'm going to give you a new spirit within all of your deepest parts. I'll remove that rock-hard heart of yours and replace it with one that's sensitive to me.
26Ezk 36:27 I'll place my spirit within you, empowering you to live according to my regulations and to keep my just decrees.
26Ezk 36:28 You'll live in the land that I gave to your ancestors, you'll be my people, and I will be your God.
26Ezk 36:29 In addition, I'll deliver you from everything that makes you unclean. I'll call out to the grain you plant, ordering it to produce abundant yields, and I will never bring famine in your direction.
26Ezk 36:30 I'll increase the yields of your fruit trees and crops so that you'll never again experience the disgrace of famine that occurs in other nations.
26Ezk 36:31 "Then you'll remember your lifestyles and practicies that were not good. You will hate yourelves as you look at your own iniquities and loathsome practices.
26Ezk 36:32 I won't be doing any of this for your sake," declares the Lord God, "so keep that in mind. Be ashamed and frustrated because of your behavior, you house of Israel!"
26Ezk 36:33 'This is what the Lord God says£º "At the same time that I cleanse you from all of your guilt, I'll make your cities become inhabited again and the desolate wastelands be rebuilt.
26Ezk 36:34 The desolate fields will be cultivated, replacing the former wasteland that everyone who passed by in times past had noticed.
26Ezk 36:35 They will say, 'This wasteland has become like the garden of Eden, and what used to be desolate ruins are now fully built and inhabited.
26Ezk 36:36 "Then the surviving people that live around you will learn that I, the Lord, have rebuilt these ruins and have cultivated these pastures that used to be desolate wastelands. I, the Lord, have spoken this, and I'm going to bring it about!"
26Ezk 36:37 "This is what the Lord God has to say£º 'I'm going to allow the house of Israel to ask anything they want from me, including this£º I'm going to increase their population as a shepherd increases his flock.
26Ezk 36:38 The desolate cities will be filled with flocks of human being, just like Jerusalem used to be filed with flocks of sheep during the times of the appointed feasts. Then they will know that I am the Lord.'"
26Ezk 37:1 The Lord laid his hand on me and brought me out by the Spirit of the Lord to the middle of a valley that was filled with bones.
26Ezk 37:2 He led me up and down throughout the valley, and I was amazed to see that the surface of the entire valley was covered with myriads of very dry bones!
26Ezk 37:3 The Lord asked me, "Son of Man, will these bones ever live? "Lord God," I replied, "you know the answer to that!"
26Ezk 37:4 Then the Lord told me, "Prophesy to these bones. Tell them£º 'You dry bones, listen to the message from the Lord£º 
26Ezk 37:5 This is what the Lord God says to you dry bones! 'Pay attention! I'm bringing my Spirit into you right now, and you're going to live!
26Ezk 37:6 I'm going to grow tendons on you, regenerate your flesh, cover you with skin, and make you breathe again so that you can come alive and learn that I am the Lord.'"
26Ezk 37:7 So I prophesied, just as I had been ordered to do so. Immediately there was a noise and a rattling-and then all of a sudden the bones came together by themselves! Each bone came together, one to another!
26Ezk 37:8 As I continued to watch, I saw tendons growing on the bones, and muscles growing up to cover them, and then skin covered the flesh from above. But the bodies weren't breathing.
26Ezk 37:9 Then he ordered me, "Prophesy to the Spirit, Son of Man. Tell the Spirit, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "Come from the four winds, you Spirit, and breathe into these people who have been killed, so they will live."'"
26Ezk 37:10 So I prophesied as I had been ordred, and breath entered into them, and they began to live. They stood on their own feet as a vast, united army.
26Ezk 37:11 "These bones represent the entire house of Israel," the Lord explained to me. "Look how they keep saying, 'Our bones are dried up, and our future is lost. We've been completely eliminated!'
26Ezk 37:12 "Therefore prophesy to them, and tell them, 'Watch me! I'm going to open your graves, lift you out of those graves, and bring my people back into the land of Israel.
26Ezk 37:13 Then you'll learn that I am the Lord, when I've opened your graves and caused you to come up out of them, my people.
26Ezk 37:14 I'm going to place my spirit in you all, and you will live. I'll place you all into your land, and you'll learn that I, the Lord, have been speaking and doing this,' declares the Lord."
26Ezk 37:15 A message came to me from the Lord, and it had this to say£º 
26Ezk 37:16 "Now as for you, Son of Man, grab a stick of wood for yourself and write on it these words£º For Judah and the Israelites, his associates Then grab another stick and write on it£º For Joseph, the stick of Ephraim, and all the house of Israel, his associates
26Ezk 37:17 Then join them together end-to-end for yourself so that they become a single baton in your hand.
26Ezk 37:18 "When the descendants of your people ask you 'Would you please explain to us what you mean by this?
26Ezk 37:19 you are to tell them, 'This is what the Lord says£º "Watch me! I'm taking the stick that represents Joseph, which Ephraim is holding in his hand, along with his companions the tribes of Israel, and I'm going to join them with the stick that is Judah. I'm making them a single stick, that is, a complete baton in my hand."'
26Ezk 37:20 "The sticks on which you engrave your writing are to remain right in front of them in your hand.
26Ezk 37:21 Then tell them, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "Watch me take the Israelites out of the nations where they've gone and return them from every direction. I'm going to bring them back into their own land.
26Ezk 37:22 I'm going to make them a united people in the land, on the mountains of Israel, and I'll set a single king to rule over them. They'll never again be two separate people. They'll never again be divided into two kingdoms.
26Ezk 37:23 "'"They will never again defile themselves with their idols, with other loathsome things, or with any of their sins. Instead, I will deliver them from all of the places where they have sinned, and then I'll cleanse them. They will be my people and I will be their God."'"
26Ezk 37:24 "'"My servant King David will be there for them, and one shepherd will be appointed for them. They will live in my decrees, keep my regulations, and practice them.
26Ezk 37:25 They will live in the land that I gave to my servant Jacob and on which your ancestors lived. They will live in that land, along with their children and grandchildren, forever. David my servant will be their everlasting leader.
26Ezk 37:26 I'll make a secure covenant with them, one that will last forever. I will establish them, make them increase, and will place my sanctuary in their midst forever.
26Ezk 37:27 I will pitch my tent among them and will be their God. They will be my people,
26Ezk 37:28 and the nations will know that I, the Lord, am the sanctifier of Israel when I place my sanctuary in their midst forever."'"
26Ezk 38:1 The word of the Lord came to me£º 
26Ezk 38:2 "Son of Man, turn your attention toward Gog, from the land of Magog, the chief noble of Meshech, and Tubal. Prophesy this against him:
26Ezk 38:3 'This is what the Lord God says£º "Watch out! I'm coming after you, Gog, chief ruler of Rosh, Meshech, and Tubal.
26Ezk 38:4 I'm going to turn you around, put hooks into your jaws, and bring you out - you and your whole army - along with you're your horses and cavalry riders, all of them richly attired, a magnificent company replete with buckler and shield, and all of them wielding battle swords.
26Ezk 38:5 Persia, Cush, and Lybia will be accompanying them, all of them equipped with shields and helmets.
26Ezk 38:6 Gomer with all its troops, and the household of Togarmah from the remotest parts of the north with all its troops-many people will accompany you.
26Ezk 38:7 Be prepared. Yes, prepare yourself-you and all of your many batallions that have gathered together around you to protect you.
26Ezk 38:8 "Many days from now - in the latter years-you will be summoned to a land that has been restored from violence. You will be gathered from many nations to the mountains of Israel, which formerly had been a continual waste, but which will be populated with people who have been brought back from the nations. All of them will be living there securely.
26Ezk 38:9 You'll arise suddenly, like a tornado, coming like a windstorm to cover the land, you and all your soldiers with you, along with many nations.
26Ezk 38:10 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'This is what's going to happen on that day you begin your invasion£º You'll be thinking in your heart, making evil plans,
26Ezk 38:11 and boasting, "I'm going to invade a land comprised of open country that is at rest, living in confidence, all of whose inhabitants will be living securely with neither fortification nor bars on their doors.
26Ezk 38:12 I'm going to confiscate anything I can put my hands on. I'll attack the restored ruins and the people who have been gathered together from the nations, who are acquiring livestock and other goods, and who live at the center of the world's attention.
26Ezk 38:13 Businessmen based in Sheba, Dedan, Tarshish, and all of its growling lions will ask you, "Are you coming for war spoils?Have you assembled your armies to carry off silver and gold, and to gather lots of war booty?'
26Ezk 38:14 "Therefore, Son of Man, prophesy to Gog and tell him, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "When the day comes on which my people are living securely, won't you be aware of it - 
26Ezk 38:15 You'll come in from your home in the remotest parts of the north. You'll come with many nations, all of them riding along on horses. You'll be a hugh, combined army.
26Ezk 38:16 You'll come up to invade my people Israel like a a storm cloud to cover the land. In the last days, Gog, I'll bring you up to invade my land so that the world will learn to know me when I show them how holy I am before their very eyes."'"
26Ezk 38:17 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'Surely you're the one about whom I spoke years ago in the writings of my servants, Israel's prophets, aren't you?They predicted back then that I would bring you up after many years, didn't they - 
26Ezk 38:18 So it will be that on that day, when Gog invades the land of Israel,' declares the Lord God, 'my zeal will ignite my anger.
26Ezk 38:19 In my zealousness and in my burning anger, on that day there will be a massive earthquake throughout the land of Israel.
26Ezk 38:20 I'm going to shake the fish in the sea, the birds in the sky, the wild beasts, all the creatures that crawl on the earth, and every single human being who lives on the surface of the earth. Mountains will collapse, as will their mountain passages, and every wall will fall to the ground.
26Ezk 38:21 Then I'll call for war against Gog on top of every mountain,' declares the Lord God, 'and every weapon of war will be turned against their fellow soldier.
26Ezk 38:22 I'll judge them with disease and bloodshed. I'll shower him, his soldiers, and the vast army that accompanies him a torrential flood, hailstones, fire, and sulfur.
26Ezk 38:23 I will exalt myself and demonstrate my holiness, making myself known to many people, who shall learn that I am the Lord.'"
26Ezk 39:1 "Now as for you, Son of Man, prophesy against Gog and tell him, '"This is what the Lord God has to say£º 'Watch out, Gog, you leader of the head of Meshech and Tubal!
26Ezk 39:2 I'm going to turn you around, drag you along to your destruction, and bring you up from the farthest parts of the north, and carry you to the mountains of Israel.
26Ezk 39:3 There I will strike your bow from your left hand and your arrows from your right, causing your fall.
26Ezk 39:4 You will collapse on the mountains of Israel, along with all of your soldiers and the nations that have accompanied you. There the raptors, vultures, and wild animals will feed on you.
26Ezk 39:5 You will fall dead in the open fields, because I have ordered this to happen,' declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 39:6 'I'm also going to set fire to Magog, along with those who are settled down and at home in the islands. That's when they'll learn that I am the Lord.
26Ezk 39:7 I'll make my holiness and reputation known in the midst of my people Israel, and I won't let my holiness be profaned anymore. The nations will learn that I, the Lord, am holy in the midst of Israel.
26Ezk 39:8 Pay attention! It's coming and will certainly happen,' declares the Lord God. 'This shall be the day about which I've spoken!'"'"
26Ezk 39:9 "After all this happens, the people who live in the cities of Israel will be kindling fires for seven years, using small shields, large shields, bows, arrows, clubs, personal weapons, and spears to do so.
26Ezk 39:10 They won't need to cut down trees from the fields nor gather firewood from the forests, because they will light fires with the weapons as they plunder the plunderers and loot the looters!" declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 39:11 "When all of this happens, I'm going to set aside a grave site for Gog in Israel's Traveler's Valley, near the approach to the Dead Sea. She will block off everyone who tries to bypass it. There they will bury Gog, and rename the area "Valley of Gog's Gang".
26Ezk 39:12 "The house of Israel will be burying them for seven months in order to purify the land.
26Ezk 39:13 Everyone in the land will be involved in the burials, and this will serve as a reminder for them that I have glorified myself," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 39:14 "Men will be assigned to travel continuously throughout the land, exploring for seven full months as they go about burying the bodies that remain from the battle on the surface of the ground, so that the land may be sterilized.
26Ezk 39:15 As scouts go searching throughout the land, whenever they see someone's bones, they will place a sign beside the remains until the remains have been buried in the Valley of Gog's Gang.
26Ezk 39:16 They'll also name the city that is there 'Hamonah,' as they purify the land.
26Ezk 39:17 "Now as for you, Son of Man, this is what the Lord God has to say£º 'Tell all of the birds and wild beasts to come and gather together and participate in the sacrifice that I'm going to make for you. This great sacrifice will take place on the mountains of Israel, where you'll be eating flesh and drinking blood.
26Ezk 39:18 You'll eat the flesh of mighty men and drink the blood of the world's princes, drinking the blood of these rams, lambs, goats, bulls, all of them fattened as if they're from Bashan, fit for slaughter.
26Ezk 39:19 You'll eat until you're fat and glutted. You'll drink blood until you're drunk from the sacrifice that I'm going to make for all of you.
26Ezk 39:20 You'll be fully satiated at my table, dining on horse flesh, horsemen, elite soldiers, and every kind of warrior," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 39:21 "I'm going to display my glory among the people, and every nation will see the judgment that I administer by my own hand among them.
26Ezk 39:22 The house of Israel will learn that I am the Lord their God from that day forward!
26Ezk 39:23 The nations will also learn that because of Israel's sin the house of Israel went into captivity due to their unfaithful behavior against me. As a result, I hid my presence from them, turned them over to the control of their enemies, and they died by violence.
26Ezk 39:24 It was because of their defilement and transgression that I treated them this way by hiding my presence from them."
26Ezk 39:25 "Therefore this is what the Lord God has to say£º 'I'm going to restore the resources of Jacob and show mercy to the entire house of Israel. I'll be zealous for my own reputation and for my holiness.
26Ezk 39:26 They'll forget their shame and all of their unfaithfulness by which they behaved so unfaithfully toward me. They will live on their land in confidence, not in fear.
26Ezk 39:27 When I bring them back from the nations and gather them together from the lands that belong to their enemies, I will demonstrate my holiness through them right in front of the eyes of the world,
26Ezk 39:28 and they will learn that I am the Lord their God, who sent them into exile and who gathered them back to their land. I will not leave any of them remaining in exile.
26Ezk 39:29 I'll no longer hide my presence from them again when I pour out my Spirit on the house of Israel," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 40:1 At the beginning of year 25 of our captivity, on the tenth day of the fourteenth year after the destruction of Jerusalem-on that very day-the Lord grabbed me in his hand and took me there.
26Ezk 40:2 God brought me in a series of visions to the land of Israel and placed me on top of a very high mountin, where to the south there was something that looked like the outline of a city.
26Ezk 40:3 That's where he took me. All of a sudden, there was a man whose appearance resembled glowing bronze. He had a measuring rod and line in his hand as he stood in the city gate.
26Ezk 40:4 This is what the man told me£º "Son of Man, watch carefully, listen closely, and remember everything I'm going to be showing you, because you've been brought here to be shown what you're about to see. Be sure that you tell the house of Israel everything that you observe."
26Ezk 40:5 All of a sudden, we were at the exterior wall that completely surrounded the temple. The man whom I had observed held a measuring rod that was ten and a half feet long as measured in cubits that were a cubit and a handbredth long. As he measured the thickness of the wall, he measured out one rod. Its height was also one rod.
26Ezk 40:6 Then he went over to the gate that faced toward the east, ascended its steps, and measured its thresholds. One threshold measured one rod and the other one measured one rod.
26Ezk 40:7 Each guardhouse measured one rod long and one rod wide, and the distance between each guardhouse was five cubits. The threshold of the gate near the vestibule facing away from the temple entrance measured one rod.
26Ezk 40:8 Next he measured the vestibule of the gate facing away from the temple entrance at one rod.
26Ezk 40:9 He measured the vestibule of the gate inside at eight cubits and the doorjambs at two cubits. (The vestibule at the gate faced away from the temple.)
26Ezk 40:10 Gate guardhouses stood facing east, numbereding three on each side, each of them of equal size to the door jamb; that is, having the same measurement on each side.
26Ezk 40:11 He measured the width of the gateway at ten cubits, and the length of the gate at thirteen cubits.
26Ezk 40:12 The retaining wall in front of the guardhouses measured one cubit wide. It stood one cubit from the wall to the guardhouses, which were six cubits square.
26Ezk 40:13 He measured the gate from the roof of the guardhouses to the roof of another at 25 cubits from doorway to opposite doorway.
26Ezk 40:14 Then he measured the open air porch at 60 cubits from the doorjamb of the courtyard the encompassed the gate.
26Ezk 40:15 The distance from the front entrance gate to the vestibule of the inner gate measured 50 cubits.
26Ezk 40:16 Latticed windows faced the guardhouses, their side pillars within the gate all around, and also for the porches. Windows were placed all around inside, and the side pillars were engraved with palm trees.
26Ezk 40:17 Next, he brought me into the outer court, where chambers and a paved area had been constructed all around the courtyard, with 30 chambers facing the pavement.
26Ezk 40:18 The pavement to the side of the gates corresponded to the length of the gates.
26Ezk 40:19 He also measured the width from the front lower gate to the front of the exterior inner court at 100 cubits to the east and to the north.
26Ezk 40:20 Next, he measured the length and width of the outer north-facing gate to the courtyard.
26Ezk 40:21 It was equipped with three guardhouses on each side. Its side pillars and porches had measurements identical to the first gate£º 50 cubits long and 25 cubits wide.
26Ezk 40:22 Its windows, porches, and palm tree ornaments had measurements identical to the east-facing gate. Reached by seven ascending steps, its porch lay to the front of the steps.
26Ezk 40:23 From a gate that stood opposite the northern gate he measured 100 cubits, as well as from the eastern gate.
26Ezk 40:24 Then he led me toward the south, where there was a gate with side pillar and porch measurements identical to the others.
26Ezk 40:25 The gate and its porches contained windows all around, identical to the other windows. The length of the porch was 50 cubits and its width was 25 cubits.
26Ezk 40:26 Seven steps led up to it, with a porch in front of them. Palm tree ornaments were engraved on its side pillars, one on each side.
26Ezk 40:27 The inner court contained a south-facing gate measuring 100 cubits from gate to gate toward the south.
26Ezk 40:28 Next, he brought me to the inner courtyard by way of the south-facing gate. He measured the south-facing gate as having measurements identical to the others.
26Ezk 40:29 The measurements of its guardhouses, its side pillars, and its porches were identical to the others. The gate and its porches contained windows all around. The length of the porch was 50 cubits and its width was 25 cubits.
26Ezk 40:30 Porches lay all around, measuring 25 cubits long and 5 cubits wide,
26Ezk 40:31 leading to the outer courtyard. Palm tree ornaments were engraved on its side pillars. The stairway leading to it contained eight steps.
26Ezk 40:32 Then he brought me into the inner east-facing courtyard, where he measured the gate, identical to the others.
26Ezk 40:33 The measurement of its guardhouses, side pillars, and porches was identical to the others. The gate and its porches contained windows all around. The length of the porch was 50 cubits and its width was 25 cubits,
26Ezk 40:34 leading to the outer courtyard. Palm tree ornaments were engraved on its side pillars. The stairway leading to it contained eight steps.
26Ezk 40:35 Next, he brought me to the north-facing gate, where he measured the gate, identical to the others.
26Ezk 40:36 The measurement of its guardhouses, side pillars, and porches was identical to the others. The gate and its porches contained windows all around. The length of the porch was 50 cubits and its width was 25 cubits,
26Ezk 40:37 leading to the outer courtyard. Palm tree ornaments were engraved on its side pillars. The stairway leading to it contained eight steps.
26Ezk 40:38 There was a chamber with a doorway by the side pillars next to the gate where they prepare the burnt offerings.
26Ezk 40:39 In the porch leading in front of the gate there were two tables on either side for slaughtering burnt offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings,
26Ezk 40:40 and on the outer side, approaching the northern gateway, there were two tables, as well two tables as on the opposite side of the porch in front of the gate.
26Ezk 40:41 Thus there were four tables on each side in front of the gate, for a total of eight tables for use in slaughtering the offerings.
26Ezk 40:42 There were four tables carved from stone for the burnt offering, each one and a half cubits long, one and a half cubits high, and one cubit high, on which the instruments are laid for slaughtering burnt offerings and sacrifices.
26Ezk 40:43 Double hooks, a single handbredth in length, were installed all around in this portion of the temple area.
26Ezk 40:44 From outside leading into the inner gate there were chambers for the choir. One was beside the north gate facing the south, and another was at the south gate facing the north.
26Ezk 40:45 The angel told me, "This south-facing chamber is for the priests who maintain the temple,
26Ezk 40:46 and the north-facing chamber is for the priests who maintain the altar. These are Zadok's descendants, who, as descendants of Levi approach the Lord to minister directly to him."
26Ezk 40:47 He measured the court in the form of a square at 100 cubits long and 100 cubits wide. The altar stood in front of the temple.
26Ezk 40:48 Next, he brought me to the temple porch and measured the side pillars at five cubits on each side. The width of the gate measured three cubits on each side.
26Ezk 40:49 The porch was 20 cubits long and eleven cubits wide. The stairway by which it was ascended was equipped with columns attached to its side pillars, one on each side.
26Ezk 41:1 Next he brought me to the temple and measured its door jambs at six cubits wide on each side of the structure.
26Ezk 41:2 The entrance was ten cubits wide and its door jambs were five cubits wide on each side. He measured the length of the nave at 40 cubits and its width at 20 cubits.
26Ezk 41:3 Then he went inside and measured the door jambs at two cubits wide and the doorway at six cubits high. The doorway was seven cubits wide.
26Ezk 41:4 He measured its length at 20 cubits, its width at 20 cubits in front of the structure, and then he told me, "This is the most holy area."
26Ezk 41:5 Next, he measured the temple walls at six cubits high and the wide of the side chambers at four cubits around all four sides of the temple.
26Ezk 41:6 The side chambers consisted of three stories, each above the other, with 30 chambers in each story. The side chambers extended out from the wall that faced the inside of the chambers where the chambers were fastened together, but the chamber walls were not fastened directly into the temple walls itself.
26Ezk 41:7 The side chambers surrounding the temple were wider at each successive story, because the surrounding structure ascended by proportional increments as it rose, making ascent to the highest story by going up successively from the lowest.
26Ezk 41:8 I observed a raised platform that surrounded the temple, and the foundations of the side chambers were a full six cubits deep.
26Ezk 41:9 The outer wall of the side chambers was five cubits thick, and there was an empty space between the temple's side chambers
26Ezk 41:10 and its outer chambers 20 cubits in width, surrounding the temple on each side.
26Ezk 41:11 The side chamber door ways facing the free space contained a single north-facing doorway and a second south-facing doorway. The width of the free space was five cubits all around the perimeter.
26Ezk 41:12 The building that faced the west side of the courtyard was 70 cubits wide, and the building's wall was five cubits thick all around. It was 90 cubits long.
26Ezk 41:13 Then he measured the temple. It was 100 cubits long, and the courtyard, its building, and its walls were 100 cubits long.
26Ezk 41:14 The front of the temple and its east-facing courtyard were each 100 cubits long.
26Ezk 41:15 Next, he measured 100 cubits as the length of the structure toward the front of the courtyard that stood behind it, where it housed a gallery on each side of it. Then he measured the temple and the inner porticos of the courtyard,
26Ezk 41:16 the thresholds, the shielded windows, and the surrounding three-storied galleries that stood opposite. From the ground to the shielded windows, they were paneled with wood all around,
26Ezk 41:17 including up to the doorway, up to the temple (both within and without) and all around both sides of the inner wall, according to his measurement.
26Ezk 41:18 There were carved cherubim and palm trees, alternating with palm tree between cherub, and each cherub had two faces,
26Ezk 41:19 with a human face looking toward the palm tree on one side and a young lion's face looking toward the palm tree on the other side. These carvings extended all the way around the temple,
26Ezk 41:20 from the ground to above the doorway, as well as on the walls of the main sanctuary.
26Ezk 41:21 The door posts of the main sanctuary were square. Each door post was identical in appearance to any other.
26Ezk 41:22 The altar was made of wood, three cubits high and two cubits long. Its corners, base, and wides were of wood. He told me, "This table stands in the Lord's presence."
26Ezk 41:23 The nave and the sanctuary each were equipped with double doors.
26Ezk 41:24 Each door had two sections mounted on hinges, for a total of two sections for one door and two sections for the other.
26Ezk 41:25 The doors of the nave had carvings engraved on them, consisting of cherubim and palm trees identical to those on the walls. The front of the exterior porch was equipped with a wooden threshold.
26Ezk 41:26 Shielded windows and palm trees were visible on both sides; that is, on the sides of the porch, the side chambers of the temple, and on its thresholds.
26Ezk 42:1 Then he brought me to the outer, north-facing courtyard into the chamber that stood opposite the structure that was facing north.
26Ezk 42:2 It stood 100 cubits long and 50 cubits wide, with a door in the middle.1
26Ezk 42:3 Opposite the 20 cubits that pertained to the inner court, and opposite the paved area that pertained to the outer court, there were three stories of galleries that faced each other.
26Ezk 42:4 In front of the chambers there was an inner walkway ten cubits wide and 100 cubits wide, the openings to which were on the north.
26Ezk 42:5 The upper chambers were narrower, since the galleries required more space than did the lower and middle portions of the building.
26Ezk 42:6 The three part structure had no columns, unlike the courts, which is why the upper chambers were offset from the ground upward, more so than the lower and middle chambers.
26Ezk 42:7 The outer wall by the side of the chambers toward the outer court and facing the chambers was 50 cubits long.
26Ezk 42:8 While the chambers in the outer court were 50 cubits in length, the chambers facing the temple were 100 cubits long.
26Ezk 42:9 Below these chambers, as one might enter from the outer court, was the east side entrance.
26Ezk 42:10 There were chambers built into the thick part of the wall of the court facing the east; that is, facing the separate area toward the front of the building,
26Ezk 42:11 with a passage way in front of them, similar in appearance to the chambers that were on the north, proportional to their length and width, with all of their exits according to their arrangements and doorways.
26Ezk 42:12 Corresponding to the chamber doorways facing the south was an opening at the beginning of the passage; that is, the passage in front of the corresponding part of the wall facing east as one might enter.
26Ezk 42:13 Then he told me, "The north and south chamber, which are opposite the courtyard are consecrated areas where the priests who approach the Lord will eat consecrated offerings and lay the consecrated grain offerings, sin offerings, and guilt offerings, because the area is holy.
26Ezk 42:14 When the priest enters, they will not enter the out court from the sanctuary without having removed their garments worn during their time of ministry, because they are holy. They will clothe themselves with alternate garments, and then they will approach the area reserved for the people."
26Ezk 42:15 After he had finished measuring the inner temple, he brought me out by way of the east facing gate and measured it all around.
26Ezk 42:16 He measured the east side at 500 reeds, according to the length of the measuring stick,
26Ezk 42:17 the north side at 500 reeds, according to the length of the measuring stick,
26Ezk 42:18 the south side at 500 reeds, according to the length of the measuring stick,
26Ezk 42:19 and the west side at 500 reeds, according to the length of the measuring stick.
26Ezk 42:20 He measured a wall that encompassed all four sides, 500 hundred long and 500 wide, dividing between the sacred and the common.
26Ezk 43:1 Next, he brought me to the east facing gate,
26Ezk 43:2 and the glory of the God of Israel was coming from the east. His voice sounded like roaring water, and the land shimmered from his glory.
26Ezk 43:3 His appearance in the vision that I was having was similar to what I observed in the vision where he had come to destroy the city, and also like the visions that I saw by the Chebar River. I fell flat on my face
26Ezk 43:4 while the glory of the Lord entered the tample by way of the east-facing gate.
26Ezk 43:5 Just then, the Spirit lifted me up and carried me into the inner courtyard, where the glory of the Lord was filling the temple!
26Ezk 43:6 I heard someone speaking to me from the temple, and a man appeared, standing beside me!
26Ezk 43:7 "Son of Man," the Lord God told me, "This is where my throne is, where I place the soles of my feet, and where I will live among the Israelites forever. The house of Israel will no longer defile my holy name-neither they nor their kings - by their unfaithfulness, by the lifeless idols of their kings on their funeral mounds,
26Ezk 43:8 by their setting up their threshold too close to my threshold and their door post too close to my door post, with a wall between me and them. After all, they have defiled my holy name by their loathsome things that they did, so I devoured them in my anger.
26Ezk 43:9 But now let them send their unfaithfulness and lifeless idols of their kings far away from me, and I will live among them forever."
26Ezk 43:10 "And now, Son of Man, describe the temple to the house of Israel. They will be ashamed because of their sin. They will measure its pattern.
26Ezk 43:11 If they are ashamed of everything that they've done, you are to reveal to them the design of the temple, its structure, its exits and entrances, its plans, its ordinances, and all of its regulations. Write it down where they can see it and remember all of its designs and regulations, so they will implement them.
26Ezk 43:12 This is to be the regulation for the temple£º the entire area on top of the mountain is to be considered wholly consecrated. This is to be the law of the temple."11
26Ezk 43:13 "Here are the measurements of the altar in cubits that were a cubit and a handbreadth long£º its base is a cubit long and a cubit wide, and its border around the edge at one handbreadth is to be the height of the altar.
26Ezk 43:14 From the base on the ground to its lower edge is to be two cubits, with its width to be one cubit. From the lesser ledge to the larger edge is to be four cubits. Its width is to be one cubit.13
26Ezk 43:15 "The hearth is to be four cubits high, and four horns are to extend upwards from the hearth.
26Ezk 43:16 "The hearth is to be twelve cubits long and twelve cubits wide; that is, it will be a four-sided square.
26Ezk 43:17 It is to have a ledge fourteen cubits long by fourteen cubits wide around the four sides. Its border is to be half a cubit and its base is to be a cubit all around, with its steps facing east."
26Ezk 43:18 Then he said to me, "This is what the Lord God says£º 'These are the regulations for the altar, starting the day that it is constructed for presenting burnt offerings and sprinkling blood.
26Ezk 43:19 You are to present to the Levitical priests, Zadok's descendants, who will approach me to serve me, a young bull for a sin offering,' declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 43:20 'You are to take some of its blood and put it on the four horns of the altar, on its four corners of the ledge, and on the border that surrounds it, thus cleansing it and making an atonement for it.
26Ezk 43:21 You are also to present a bull for a sin offering, incincerating it in the appointed place at the temple, outside the sanctuary.
26Ezk 43:22 "The second day following commencement of offerings, you are to offer a male goat without defect for a sin offering to cleanse the altar the same way they cleansed it with the bull.
26Ezk 43:23 After you've finished the cleansing, you are to present a young bull without defect and a ram from the flock without defect.
26Ezk 43:24 You are to present them in the Lord's presence, and the priests are to throw salt on them and then present them as a burnt offering to the Lord.
26Ezk 43:25 "Every day for a week, you are to prepare a goat for a sin offering, a young bull, and a ram from the flock, each without defect.
26Ezk 43:26 For a seven day period they are to make atonement for the altar, purifying it and consecrating it.
26Ezk 43:27 When they will have completed this period, from the eighth day following the priests are to offer your burnt offerings on the altar, along with your peace offerings, and I will accept you,' declares the Lord God."
26Ezk 44:1 Then the Lord God brought me back by way of the east-facing outer gate of the sanctuary. But it was shut. 
26Ezk 44:2 The Lord said to me, "This gate is to remain shut. It will not be opened. No man is to enter in by it, because the Lord God of Israel entered in by it, so it is to remain shut.
26Ezk 44:3 The Regent Prince will be seated there, as Regent Prince, and will dine in the Lord's presence, entering by way of the portico of the gate and exiting by the same way."
26Ezk 44:4 Then he brought me by way of the north-facing gate to the front of the temple. As I looked, the glory of the Lord filled the Lord's temple, and I fell flat on my face!
26Ezk 44:5 Then the Lord told me, "Son of Man, watch carefully, listen closely, and remember everything I'm going to be telling you about all the statutes pertaining to the Lord's temple and all of its laws. Pay careful attention to the entrance to the temple, along with all of the exits to the sanctuary."
26Ezk 44:6 "You are to tell the Resistance-that is, the house of Israel, 'This is what the Lord God says£º "I've had enough of all of your loathsome behavior, you house of Israel!
26Ezk 44:7 You kept on bringing in foreigners, those who were both uncircumcised in heart and flesh, to profane my sanctuary by being inside my temple, and by doing so you've emptied my covenant, all the while offering my food - the fat and the blood - in addition to all of your other loathsome things.
26Ezk 44:8 Furthermore, you haven't observed the requirements of my holy things. Instead, you placed foreigners in charge of my sanctuary."'
26Ezk 44:9 "This is what the Lord God says, 'No foreigner who is both uncircumcised in heart and flesh, of all the foreigners who are among the Israelites is to enter my sanctuary.
26Ezk 44:10 But the Levites, who went far away from me when Israel abandoned me, who left me to follow their idols, are to bear the punishment of their iniquity.
26Ezk 44:11 Nevertheless, they are to serve in my sanctuary, overseeing the gates of the temple, ministering to the temple, slaughtering the burnt offerings and the sacrifices presented for the people, standing in the presence of the people, and ministering to them.
26Ezk 44:12 Because they kept serving them in the presence of their idols, becoming a sin-filled stumbling block to the house of Israel,'" declares the Lord God. "'I have sworn against them that they are to bear the consequences of their iniquity.
26Ezk 44:13 They are not to come near me to serve as a priest to me, nor approach any of my holy things, including the most holy things. Instead, they are to bear the shame of the loathsome things that they have committed.
26Ezk 44:14 Nevertheless, I will appoint them to take care of my temple, includings all of its service and everything that is to be done inside of it.'"
26Ezk 44:15 "The descendants of Zadok, Levitical priests who took care of my sanctuary when the Israelites wandered away from me, are to come near me to minister to me. They are to stand before me to offer the fat and the blood to me," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 44:16 "They are to enter my sanctuary, approach my table to minister to me, and observe my requirements.
26Ezk 44:17 Whenever they enter at the gates of the inner court, they are to be clothed with linen garments. They are not to wear wool when they are ministering within the gates of the inner courtyard or in the temple.
26Ezk 44:18 Linen turbans are to be on their heads, and they are to wear linen undergarments. Also, they are not to clothe themselves with anything that makes them perspire.
26Ezk 44:19 "When they enter the outer courtyard, that is, the outer courtyard where the people are, they are to take off their garments in which they were ministering, lay them in the consecrated chambers, and put on different garments so they will not transfer holiness to the people through their garments.
26Ezk 44:20 Also, they are not to shave their heads nor let their hair grow long. Instead, they are certainly to trim the hair on their heads.
26Ezk 44:21 "None of the priests are to drink wine upon entering the inner courtyard.
26Ezk 44:22 "They are not to marry a widow or a divorced woman. Instead, they are to marry virgins from the descendants of the house of Israel, or a widow who is the widow of a priest."
26Ezk 44:23 "They are to teach my people how to discern what is holy compared to what is common, showing them how to discern between what is unclean and clean.
26Ezk 44:24 When disputes arise, they are to take their stand to judge, adjudicating matters according to my ordinances. They are to enforce my laws, my statutes, all of my appointed feasts, and they are to sanctify my Sabbaths.
26Ezk 44:25 "They are not to come in contact with a dead body, so as not to defile themselves, except in the case of their father, mother, son, daughter, brother, or for an unmarried sister, on whose behalf they may defile themselves.
26Ezk 44:26 After he is cleansed, he is to remain exempt from ministry for seven days.
26Ezk 44:27 On the day that he returns to the sanctuary's inner court to minister, he is to offer his own sin offering," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 44:28 "Now with respect to their inheritances, I am to be their inheritance, and you are to give them no possession in Israel, since I am their possession.
26Ezk 44:29 They are to eat the grain offerings, sin offering, and guilt offering. Everything consecrated in Israel is to belong to them.
26Ezk 44:30 The first portion of all the first fruits of every kind and every offering of any kind is to be for the priests. You are to give the priest the first portion of your grain. As a result a blessing will rest on your household.
26Ezk 44:31 However, the priests are not to eat any bird or animal that has died a natural death or that has been torn apart."
26Ezk 45:1 "When you divide the land for an inheritance, you are to present a Terumah to the Lord, a consecrated portion of the land, the length of which is to be 25,000 cubits, and the width of which is to be 20,000 cubits. The entire contents of this area are to be treated as holy."
26Ezk 45:2 "A holy place is to be dedicated from this area in the form of a square measuring 500 by 500 cubits, with a 50 cubit buffer zone surrounding it.
26Ezk 45:3 From this area a measure is to be made 25,000 cubits long and 10,000 cubits wide, which is to contain the sanctuary, the holiest of holy objects.
26Ezk 45:4 It is to be a holy portion of the land, set aside for the priests who serve the sanctuary, who approach to serve the Lord. It is to be a place for their houses, as well as the holy place of the sanctuary.
26Ezk 45:5 "An area 25,000 cubits long by 10,000 cubits wide is to be set aside for use by the Levite servants of the temple, 20 parcels for their residential properties.
26Ezk 45:6 "The land allocation for the city is to be set at 5,000 cubits wide and 25,000 cubits long, adjacent to the sanctuary district, reserved for the entire house of Israel."
26Ezk 45:7 "The Regent Prince is to have a portion on both sides of the consecrated allotment for the sanctuary and the city's land allotment, adjacent to both on the west and the east sides, comparable in length to one of the portions from the west border to the east border.
26Ezk 45:8 This property in Israel is to belong to the Regent Prince, so my regent princes will no longer mistreat my nation. The remaining portion of the land is to be allotted to the house of Israel, that is, to its tribes."7
26Ezk 45:9 "This is what the Lord God says, 'Enough of you, you regent princes of Israel! Abandon your violence and destruction. Practice what is just and right instead! Stop confiscating property from my people!' declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 45:10 It's to be an honest scale, an honest dry measure, and an honest liquid measure for you!
26Ezk 45:11 "The ephah and the bath are to be of equal volume; that is, the bath is to contain one tenth of a homer and the ephah one tenth of a homer. The homer is to be the standard on which their volume measurement is to be based.
26Ezk 45:12 "The shekel is to weigh 20 gerahs. The mina is to be comprised of three coins weighing 20, 25, and fifteen shekels, respectively."
26Ezk 45:13 "Here are the standards for presenting offerings£º a sixth of an ephah that is based on the standard homer of wheat, and a sixth of an ephah based on the standard homer of barley.
26Ezk 45:14 The olive oil quota is to be based on the bath, measured at ten baths to each homer, which is equal to one kor.
26Ezk 45:15 The sheep quota is to be one from each flock of 200 taken from the pastures of Israel. From all of these you are to present grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings, to make atonement for them," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 45:16 "The entire nation living in the land is to present this offering to the Regent Prince in Israel.
26Ezk 45:17 The Regent Prince is to provide the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and drink offerings at the feasts, on the new moons and Sabbaths, and at all of the proscribed feasts of the house of Israel. He is to provide the grain offerings, burnt offerings, and peace offerings in order to make atonement for the house of Israel."
26Ezk 45:18 "This is what the Lord God says, 'On the first day of the first month, you are to present a young bull without defect in order to cleanse the sanctuary.
26Ezk 45:19 The priest is to place some of the blood from the sin offering on the door posts of the temple, on the four corners of the ledge around the altar, and on the posts of the gate leading to the inner court.
26Ezk 45:20 You are also to do this on the seventh day of the month, to make atonement for any person who wanders away or who sins through ignorance in order to make atonement for the temple.
26Ezk 45:21 "'On the fourteenth day of the first month, you are to observe the Passover as a feast for seven days. Unleavened bread is to be eaten.
26Ezk 45:22 On that day, the Regent Prince is to provide, both for himself and for all the people who live in the land, a bull for a sin offering.
26Ezk 45:23 Each day during the seven days of the feast, he is to provide a burnt offering to the Lord, consisting of seven bulls and seven rams without defect, offered each day throughout the seven days, along with a male goat offered each day as a sin offering.
26Ezk 45:24 "'The Regent Prince is also to present a grain offering consisting of an ephah with each bull and an ephah with each ram, along with a hin of olive oil mixed with an ephah of grain.
26Ezk 45:25 "'On the fifteenth day of the seven month, during a seven day feast, the Regent Prince is to present these as daily sin offerings, burnt offerings, and grain offerings mixed with oil.
26Ezk 46:1 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'The inner, east-facing courtyard will remain shut during the six working days of the week, but on the Sabbath day it will be opened, as well as on the day of the new moon.
26Ezk 46:2 "'The Regent Prince will enter by way of the portico of the gate from outside and will stand at the doorframe of the gate where the priests will present the Regent Prince's burnt offerings and peace offerings. Then the Regent Prince will worship at the threshold of the gate and go out. The gate will not be closed until evening.
26Ezk 46:3 "'The people who live in the land will worship at the doorway of the gate on the sabbaths and new moons in the Lord's presence.
26Ezk 46:4 "'The burnt offering that the Regent Prince will present to the Lord on the Sabbath day will consist of six lambs without defect, a ram without defect,
26Ezk 46:5 a grain offering with the ram consisting of an ephah, a grain offering with the lambs consisting of whatever amount he brings with him, and a hin of oil with each ephah of grain.
26Ezk 46:6 "'Furthermore, each new moon there is to be a young bull without defect and six male lambs and a ram without defect.
26Ezk 46:7 The Regent Prince will present an ephah of grain along with the bull, an ephah of grain along with the ram, a grain offering-consisting of as much as he is able to give-and a hin of olive oil with each ephah of grain.
26Ezk 46:8 "'The Regent Prince will enter by way of the portico of the gate and will leave the same way he came in.
26Ezk 46:9 When the people who live in the land come into the Lord's presence during the feasts, whoever enters by way of the northern gate will leave by way of the southern gate, and whoever enters by way of the southern gate will leave by way of the northern gate. No one will leave by the same route that he enters, but instead will go straight out.
26Ezk 46:10 The Regent Prince will enter when they are coming in, and he will leave when they go out.
26Ezk 46:11 "'The grain offering for the festivals and appointed feasts will include an ephah with a bull, an ephah with a ram, and as much grain with the lambs as the Regent Prince brings with him, along with a hin of oil with each ephah.
26Ezk 46:12 "'Whenever the Regent Prince presents a voluntary offering, burnt offering, or peace offering, he will present it voluntarily to the Lord, and the east-facing gate is to be opened for him. He is to provide his burnt offering and peace offering as he does on the Sabbath. When he leaves, the gate is to be shut behind him.
26Ezk 46:13 "'He is to present a one year old lamb without defect for a burnt offering to the Lord in the morning every day.
26Ezk 46:14 In addition, he is to present a grain offering with it every morning, consisting of a sixth of an ephah mixed with and one third of a hin of oil. This grain offering is to be offered to the Lord, pursuant to a permanent ordinance.
26Ezk 46:15 "'They are to present the lamb offering, the grain offering, and the oil every morning as an ongoing burnt offering.'"
26Ezk 46:16 "This is what the Lord God says£º 'If the Regent Prince gives a gift to someone, it is to remain with the man's descendants as their own inheritance.
26Ezk 46:17 But if he gives a gift to any of his servants, it is to belong to the servant until the Year of Release, at which time it is to be returned to the Regent Prince. His inheritance is to belong only to his sons.
26Ezk 46:18 The Regent Prince is not to appropriate the nation's inheritance nor take advantage of them by taking their property from them. Instead, he is to provide an inheritance for his sons from his own possessions so that my people will not be separated from their possessions.'"
26Ezk 46:19 Then the angel brought me in through an entrance beside the gate into the north-facing chambers dedicated to the priests. As I looked toward the rear of the far western end, I saw a place
26Ezk 46:20 about which he said, "This is where the priests will be boiling the guilt and sin offerings and baking the grain offerings so they don't bring them through the outer courtyard, thus diminishing the people's holiness."
26Ezk 46:21 Then he brought me out to the exterior courtyard and led me across to each of the four corners of the courtyard. There in each corner was an enclosed area set aside,
26Ezk 46:22 all of them the same size; that is, each were 40 cubits long and 30 cubits wide.
26Ezk 46:23 A low wall built of masonry surrounded each courtyard, with boiling places set in rows in the wall.
26Ezk 46:24 He told me, "This is where the ministers of the Temple will be preparing the sacrifices that will be presented by the people.
26Ezk 47:1 After this, he brought me back to the doorway to the temple. To my amazement, there was water flowing out toward the east from beneath the threshold of the temple. (The temple faced eastward.) The water flowed down from beneath the right side of the temple, that is, from the south-facing side where the altar was located.
26Ezk 47:2 Then he brought me out through the north gateway and around to the one outside that faces toward the east. To my amazement, water was trickling out from that part of the south side, too!
26Ezk 47:3 As the man went out toward the east, he carried a measuring line in his hand. He measured out 1,500 feet as he led me through water that was ankle-deep.
26Ezk 47:4 Then he measured out another 1,500 feet, where he led me through water that was knee-deep. And then he measured out another 1,500 feet, where the water was waist-deep.
26Ezk 47:5 When he had measured out another 1,500 feet, the water had become deep enough that I wasn't able to ford it. Instead, I would have had to swim through it.
26Ezk 47:6 Then, as he was bringing me back along the river bank, he asked me, "Son of Man, did you see all of this?
26Ezk 47:7 As we were coming back, I was amazaed to see that there were many, many trees lining both banks of the river.
26Ezk 47:8 He told me, "This river flows toward the eastern territories all the way down into the Arabah, and from there its water heads out toward the Dead Sea, where the sea water turns fresh.
26Ezk 47:9 It will support all kinds of living creatures that will thrive abundantly wherever the river flows. There will be a great many fish, because this water will flow there and turn the Dead Sea's salt water fresh. As a result, everything will live wherever the river flows.8
26Ezk 47:10 "A day will come when firsherman will line its banks-from Engedi to Eneglaim there will plenty of room to spread out nets. There will be all sorts of species of fish, as abundant as the fish that live in the Meditteranean Sea. There will be lots of them! 
26Ezk 47:11 "The river delta will consist of swamps and marshes that will remain a salt water wetland preserve.
26Ezk 47:12 Lining each side of the river banks, all sorts of species of fruit tree will be growing. Their leaves will never wither and their fruit will never fail. They will bear fruit every month, because the water that nourishes them will be flowing from the sanctuary. Their fruit will be for food and their leaves will contain substances that promote healing."
26Ezk 47:13 This is what the Lord God says£º "This is to be the territorial border by which you apportion the land for an inheritance among the twelve tribes of Israel, with Joseph double-portioned.
26Ezk 47:14 Apportion it for their inheritances, one man equally as if to his own brother, which is how I promised to give it to your ancestors. This way, the land will fall to you as an inheritance.
26Ezk 47:15 "This is to be the border for the land£º on the north side, from the Mediterranean Sea by the Hethlon Road to the entrance of Zedad,
26Ezk 47:16 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim (which lies between the border of Damascus and the border of Hamath), and Hazer-hatticon, which is on the border of Hauran.
26Ezk 47:17 The border shall proceed from the Mediterranean Sea to Hazer-enan (a border of Damascus), and on the north facing north will be the border of Hamath. This will be the north side.
26Ezk 47:18 "The eastern extremity will proceed from between Hauran and Damascus, then between Gilead, and then through the land of Israel-the Jordan River. You shall measure from the northern border to the Dead Sea. This will be the eastern perimeter.
26Ezk 47:19 "You will determine the southern extremity running from Tamar as far as the waters of Meribath-kadesh, then from there proceeding to the Wadi of Egypt and then to the Mediterranean Sea. This will be the southern perimeter.
26Ezk 47:20 "The western perimeter will be the Mediterranean Sea, from the southern most border to a location opposite the entrance to Hamath. This will be the western perimeter.
26Ezk 47:21 "You shall apportion this land among yourselves according to the tribes of Israel,
26Ezk 47:22 dividing it randomly among yourselves and among the aliens who live among you and bear children among you. You shall treat them like native-born Israelites. Among you they, too, shall be allotted an inheritance with the tribes of Israel.
26Ezk 47:23 Furthermore, you shall provide his inheritance there in the tribe within which the alien remains," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 48:1 "These are the names of the tribes from the northernmost extremity westward along the road from Hethlon to the entrance of Hamath, Hazar-enan (a border of Damascus) northward to the coast of Hamath. The perimeter shall run east-to-west; the tribe of Dan with one portion;
26Ezk 48:2 running along the border of the tribe of Dan from the eastern perimeter to the western perimeter, the tribe of Asher with one portion;
26Ezk 48:3 running along the border of the tribe of Asher from the eastern perimeter to the western perimeter, the tribe of Naphtali with one portion;
26Ezk 48:4 running along the border of the tribe of Naphtali from the eastern perimeter to the western perimeter, the tribe of Manasseh with one portion;
26Ezk 48:5 running along the border of the tribe of Manasseh from the eastern perimeter to the western perimeter, the tribe of Ephraim with one portion;
26Ezk 48:6 running along the border of the tribe of Ephraim from the eastern perimeter to the western perimeter, the tribe of Reuben with one portion;
26Ezk 48:7 and running along the border of the tribe of Reuben from the eastern perimeter to the western perimeter, the tribe of Judah with one portion."
26Ezk 48:8 "Running along the border of the tribe of Judah from the eastern perimeter to the western perimeter you shall set apart the Terumah, 25,000 units wide but in east-west length equal to one of the other apportionments, from the eastern perimeter to the western perimeter, with the Temple in the m iddle of it.
26Ezk 48:9 The Terumah that you shall give to the Lord shall be 25,000 units."
26Ezk 48:10 "The holy Terumah shall be reserved for these, the priests£º Toward the north, 25,000 units in length; toward the west, 10,000 units in width; toward the east, 10,000 units in width; and toward the south, 25,000 units in length. The Lord's sanctuary shall be in its midst.
26Ezk 48:11 It shall be for use by priests from the descendants of Zadok, who have observed the things with which I charged them and who did not wander astray when the Israelites went astray, just as the Levites wandered astray.
26Ezk 48:12 It shall be a Terumah for them from the allotment of the land, a most holy place, adjoining the border of the Levites."
26Ezk 48:13 "Alongside the border of the priests, the Levites shall be allotted 25,000 units in length and 10,000 units in width. The entire length is to be 25,000 units and its width 10,000 units.
26Ezk 48:14 Furthermore, they are not to sell or exchange any part of it, nor transfer this first fruits of the land, because it is holy to the Lord.
26Ezk 48:15 "The rest, 5,000 units wide and 25,000 units along its front, will serve as a common portion for use by the city for housing and open spaces, since the city shall be in its midst.
26Ezk 48:16 These shall be its dimensions£º the north side, 4,500 units; the south side, 4,500 units; the east side, 4,500 units; and the west side 4,500 units.
26Ezk 48:17 The city shall have urban areas set aside£º on the north 250 units; on the south, 250 units, on the east, 250 units; and on the west, 250 units.
26Ezk 48:18 "The remainder of the length that borders the holy Terumah shall be 10,000 units long eastward and 10,000 units westward It shall lie adjacent to the holy Terumah. Its harvest shall produce food for those who work in the city.
26Ezk 48:19 The city workers who cultivate it shall come from all the tribes of Israel.
26Ezk 48:20 The entire Terumah is to be 25,000 units by 25,000 units-you shall reserve it as a holy Terumah in the form of a square within the city limits."
26Ezk 48:21 "Now the remainder of the allotment on either side of the holy Terumah will be for the Regent Prince and for city property-over against the
26Ezk 48:25 ,000 units along the eastern border and over against the
26Ezk 48:25 ,000 units along the western border, and parallel to the allotments. These shall be for the Regent Prince. The holy Terumah and the sanctuary of the house shall stand in the middle of it.
26Ezk 48:22 Except for what belongs to the Levites and the city property, which will stand in the middle of what belongs to the Regent Prince, whatever is between the border of Judah and the border of Benjamin shall belong to the Regent Prince."
26Ezk 48:23 "Now as to the rest of the tribes£º from the east side to the west side, Benjamin will retain one portion.
26Ezk 48:24 Adjacent to the border of Benjamin running from east to west, Simeon will retain one portion.
26Ezk 48:25 Adjacent to the border of Simeon running from east to west, Issachar will retain one portion.
26Ezk 48:26 Adjacent to the border of Issachar running from east to west, Zebulun will retain one portion.
26Ezk 48:27 Adjacent to the border of Zebulun running from east to west, Gad will retain one portion.
26Ezk 48:28 Adjacent to the border of Gad to the south and extending toward the south, the border shall proceed from Tamar to the waters of Meribath-kadesh, then to the Wadi of Egypt, and from there to the Mediterranean Sea.
26Ezk 48:29 "This is the land that you are to allocate by lottery to the tribes of Israel as their inheritance, and these are their respective divisions," declares the Lord God.
26Ezk 48:30 "These are the exits to the city£º On the north side, 4,500 units by measurement,
26Ezk 48:31 shall be the gates of the city. Named after the tribes of Israel, three gates shall serve the north site£º one named the Reuben Gate, one named the Judah Gate, and one named the Levi Gate.
26Ezk 48:32 On the east side, 4,500 units by measurement, there shall be three gates£º one named the Joseph Gate, one named the Benjamin Gate, and one named the Dan Gate.

27Dn 1:1 In the third year of the reign of King Jehoiakim of Judah, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came to Jerusalem and laid siege to it.
27Dn 1:2 Within a week, the Lord handed King Jehoiakim of Judah over to him, along with valuable objects from the house of God. Nebuchadnezzar brought them to the temple of his god in the land of Shinar and stored them in its treasure house.
27Dn 1:3 The king ordered Ashpenaz, his chief officer, to bring in some Israelites of royal and noble descent.
27Dn 1:4 They were to be young men without physical defect, handsome in appearance, skilled in all wisdom, quick to learn, prudent in how they used knowledge, and capable of serving in the king's palace. They were to learn the literature and language of the Chaldeans.
27Dn 1:5 The king assigned them fine food and choice wine on a daily basis, ordering them to be trained for three years, at the end of which time they would enter the king's service.
27Dn 1:6 Included among the people of Judah were Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah.
27Dn 1:7 The chief officer assigned the name "Belteshazzar" to Daniel, the name "Shadrach" to Hannaniah, the name "Meshach" to Mishael, and the name "Abednego" to Azariah.
27Dn 1:8 Daniel determined within himself not to become defiled by the king's menu of rich foods or by the king's wine, so he requested permission from the chief officer not to defile himself.
27Dn 1:9 God granted to Daniel grace and compassion on the part of the chief officer.
27Dn 1:10 The chief officer said to Daniel, "I fear his majesty the king, who has determined what you eat and drink. If he notices that your faces are more pale than the other young men in your group, I will forfeit my head to the king."1
27Dn 1:11 But Daniel said to the guard whom the chief officer had appointed over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,
27Dn 1:12 "Please test your servants for ten days and let us be given vegetables to eat and water to drink.
27Dn 1:13 Then compare how we look with the young men who ate the king's rich food, and treat your servants in accordance with what you observe."
27Dn 1:14 So he listened to what Daniel said and tested them for ten days.
27Dn 1:15 At the end of ten days their appearance was better and their faces were well-nourished compared to the young men who ate the king's rich food.
27Dn 1:16 So the guard took away their rich food and wine, giving them vegetables.
27Dn 1:17 As for these four young men, God gave them knowledge, aptitude for learning, and wisdom. Daniel also could understand all kinds of visions and dreams.1
27Dn 1:18 Then at the end of the training period that the king had established, the chief officer brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar.
27Dn 1:19 When the king spoke to them, none of them compared to Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, or Azariah as they stood before the king.
27Dn 1:20 In every matter of wisdom or understanding that the king discussed with them, he found them ten times superior to all the astrologers and enchanters in his entire palace.
27Dn 1:21 So Daniel remained there in service until the first year of King Cyrus.
27Dn 2:1 Now during the second year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign, Nebuchadnezzar had dreams that troubled him. As a result, he couldn't sleep.
27Dn 2:2 So the king gave orders to summon the diviners, the enchanters, sorcerers, and Chaldeans to reveal to the king what he had dreamed. When they came and stood before him,
27Dn 2:3 the king said to them, "I have dreamed a dream and I will remain troubled until I can understand it."2
27Dn 2:4 The Chaldeans responded to the king in Aramaic£º "May the king live forever. Tell the dream to your servants, and we'll reveal its meaning."
27Dn 2:5 In reply the king said to the Chaldeans, "Here is what I have commanded£º If you don't tell me both the dream and its meaning, you'll be destroyed and your houses will be reduced to rubble.
27Dn 2:6 But if you do relate the dream to me as well as its meaning, you'll receive gifts, rewards, and great honor from me. Therefore reveal the dream to me, along with its meaning."
27Dn 2:7 They replied again, "Let the king tell his servants the dream, and we'll disclose its meaning."
27Dn 2:8 The king responded, "I'm convinced that you're stalling for time because you're aware of what I've commanded.
27Dn 2:9 So if you don't disclose the dream to me, there will be only one sentence for all of you. You have conspired together to present lies and corrupt interpretations until the situation changes. Now tell me the dream and I'll know that you can reveal its true meaning."
27Dn 2:10 The Chaldeans answered the king directly, "There's not a single man on earth who can do what the king has commanded. No king, lord, or ruler has ever asked such a thing from any diviner, enchanter, or Chaldean.
27Dn 2:11 Furthermore, what the king is asking is so difficult that no one can reveal it except the gods-and they don't live with human beings."
27Dn 2:12 At this point, the king flew into a rage and issued an order to destroy all the advisors of Babylon.
27Dn 2:13 When the order went out to kill the advisors, they searched for Daniel and his friends to kill them, too.
27Dn 2:14 Daniel responded with wisdom and discretion to Arioch, the king's executioner, who had gone out to execute the advisors of Babylon.
27Dn 2:15 He asked him, "Why such a harsh decree from the king? Then Arioch informed Daniel,
27Dn 2:16 so Daniel went to ask Nebuchadnezzar for an appointment to see him, and it was granted him so that he could reveal the meaning to the king.
27Dn 2:17 Then Daniel went home and told his friends Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah about the king's command.
27Dn 2:18 Daniel was seeking mercy, in order to ask about this mystery in the presence of the God of heaven, so that Daniel and his friends might not be executed along with the rest of the advisors of Babylon.
27Dn 2:19 When the mystery was revealed to Daniel in a vision later that night, Daniel blessed the God of heaven
27Dn 2:20 and said, "May the name of God be blessed forever and ever; wisdom and power are his for evermore.
27Dn 2:21 It is God who alters the times and seasons, and he removes kings and promotes kings. He gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to the discerning.
27Dn 2:22 He reveals what is profoundly mysterious and knows what is in the darkness; with him dwells light.
27Dn 2:23 To you, God of my ancestors, I give thanks and praise, because you have given me wisdom and power; you have now revealed to me what we asked of you by making known to us what the king commanded."
27Dn 2:24 After this, Daniel went to Arioch, whom the king had appointed to execute the advisors of Babylon. He told him, "Don't destroy the advisors of Babylon. Bring me before the king and I'll explain the meaning to him."
27Dn 2:25 Then Arioch quickly brought Daniel into the king's presence and informed him£º "I've found a man from the Judean captives who will make known the meaning to the king."
27Dn 2:26 King Nebuchadnezzar replied by saying to Daniel (whose Babylonian name is Belteshazzar), "Are you able to tell me about the dream and its meaning?
27Dn 2:27 By way of answer, Daniel addressed the king£º "None of the advisors, enchanters, diviners, or astrologers can explain the secret that the king has requested to be made known.
27Dn 2:28 But there is a God in heaven who reveals secrets, and he is making known to King Nebuchadnezzar what will happen in the latter days. "While you were in bed, the dream and the visions that came to your head were as follows£º 
27Dn 2:29 Your majesty, when you were in bed, thoughts came to your mind about what would happen in the future, and the Revealer of Secrets has made known to you what will take place.
27Dn 2:30 As for me, this secret was made known to me, not because my own wisdom is greater than anyone else alive, but in order that the meaning may be made known to the king, and that you might understand the thoughts of your heart.
27Dn 2:31 "Your majesty, while you were watching, you observed an enormous statue. This magnificent statue stood before you with extraordinary brilliance. Its appearance was terrifying.
27Dn 2:32 That statue had a head made of pure gold, with its chest and arms made of silver, its abdomen and thighs made of bronze,
27Dn 2:33 its legs made of iron, and its feet made partly of iron and partly of clay.
27Dn 2:34 "As you were watching, a rock was quarried-but not with human hands-and it struck the iron and clay feet of the statue, breaking them to pieces.
27Dn 2:35 Then the iron, the clay, the bronze, the silver, and the gold were broken in pieces together and became like chaff from a summer threshing floor that the breeze carries away without leaving a trace. Then the rock that struck the statue grew into a huge mountain and filled the entire earth.
27Dn 2:36 "This was the dream, and we'll now relate its meaning to the king.
27Dn 2:37 You, your majesty, king of kings-to whom the God of heaven has given the kingdom, the power, the strength, and the glory,
27Dn 2:38 so that wherever people, wild animals, or birds of the sky live, he has placed them under your control, giving you dominion over them all - you're that head of gold.
27Dn 2:39 "After you, another kingdom will arise that is inferior to yours, and then a third kingdom of bronze will arise to rule all the earth.
27Dn 2:40 Then there will be a fourth kingdom, as strong as iron. Just as all things are broken to pieces and shattered by iron, so it will shatter and crush everything.
27Dn 2:41 "The feet and toes that you saw, made partly of potter's clay and partly of iron, represent a divided kingdom. It will still have the strength of iron, in that you saw iron mixed with clay.
27Dn 2:42 Just as their toes and feet are part iron and part clay, so will the kingdom be both strong and brittle.
27Dn 2:43 Just as you saw iron mixed with clay, so they will mix themselves with human offspring. Furthermore, they won't remain together, just as iron doesn't mix with clay.
27Dn 2:44 "During the reigns of those kings, the God of heaven will set up a kingdom that will never be destroyed, nor its sovereignty left in the hands of another people. It will shatter and crush all of these kingdoms, and it will stand forever.
27Dn 2:45 Now, just as you saw that the stone was cut out of the mountain without human hands-and that it crushed the iron, bronze, clay, silver, and gold to pieces-so also the great God has revealed to the king what will take place after this. Your dream will come true, and its meaning will prove trustworthy.
27Dn 2:46 Then King Nebuchadnezzar fell on his face before Daniel, paid honor to him, and commanded that an offering and incense be presented on his behalf.
27Dn 2:47 The king told Daniel, "Truly your God is the God of gods, the Lord of kings, and the Revealer of Secrets, because you were able to reveal this mystery." 
27Dn 2:48 Then the king promoted Daniel to a high position and lavished many great gifts on him, including making him ruler over the entire province of Babylon and chief administrator over the advisors of Babylon.
27Dn 2:49 Moreover, Daniel requested that the king appoint Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego administrators over the province of Babylon, while Daniel himself remained in the royal court.
27Dn 3:1 Some time later, king Nebuchadnezzar built a golden statue, making it ninety feet high and nine feet wide. He set it up in the Dura Valley within the province of Babylon.
27Dn 3:2 Then King Nebuchadnezzar summoned the regional authorities, governors, deputy governors, advisors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all of the other administrators of the provinces, ordering them to come to the dedication of the statue that he had erected.
27Dn 3:3 So the regional authorities, governors, deputy governors, advisors, treasurers, judges, magistrates, and all of the other administrators of the provinces assembled to dedicate the statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had erected. They took their places in front of the statue that he had erected.
27Dn 3:4 Then a herald proclaimed aloud£º "People of all nations, and languages are commanded£º 
27Dn 3:5 Whenever you hear the sound of the trumpet, the flute, the lyre, the four-stringed lyre, and the harp, playing together along with various instruments, you are to fall down and worship the golden statue that was set up by King Nebuchadnezzar.
27Dn 3:6 Anyone who does not fall down and worship shall immediately be thrown into the blazing fire furnace."
27Dn 3:7 Therefore, when all of the people "heard the sound of the trumpet, the flute, the lyre, the four-stringed lyre, and the harp, playing together along with various other instruments," all the "people, nations, and languages" began to fall down and worship the golden statue that King Nebuchadnezzar had set up.
27Dn 3:8 Just then, certain influential Chaldeans took this opportunity to come forward and denounce the Jews.
27Dn 3:9 They said to King Nebuchadnezzar, "Your majesty, live forever.
27Dn 3:10 You, your majesty, issued this decree£º 'Every man who hears the sound of the trumpet, the flute, the lyre, the four-stringed lyre, and the harp, playing together along with various other instruments shall fall down and worship the golden statue.
27Dn 3:11 Whoever does not fall down and worship shall be thrown into a blazing fire furnace.'
27Dn 3:12 "Certain influential Jewish men whom you appointed to manage the city of Babylon?Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego?have neither paid attention to you, your majesty, nor served your gods. And they won't worship the golden statue that you set up."
27Dn 3:13 Nebuchadnezzar flew into a rage and furiously ordered that Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego be brought before him.
27Dn 3:14 Nebuchadnezzar asked them, "Is it true, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you don't worship my gods and that you don't worship the golden statue that has been set up - 
27Dn 3:15 Now, if you are ready at this very moment to obey 'the sound of the trumpet, the flute, the lyre, the four-stringed lyre, and the harp,' and worship the image that I have made¡¦ If you do not so worship, you will immediately have cast yourselves into the middle of the blazing fire, and what god is there who can deliver you from my power?
27Dn 3:16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego answered King Nebuchadnezzar, "It's not necessary for us to respond in this matter.
27Dn 3:17 Your majesty, if it be his will, our God whom we serve can deliver us from the blazing fire furnace, and he will deliver us from you.
27Dn 3:18 But if not, rest assured, your majesty, that we won't serve your gods, and we won't worship the golden statue that you have set up."
27Dn 3:19 Out of control with rage, Nebuchadnezzar's facial expression changed toward Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and he ordered that the furnace be heated seven times hotter than usual.
27Dn 3:20 Then he issued orders to his elite guard to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego with ropes and throw them into the blazing fire furnace.
27Dn 3:21 So the elite guard tied them up fully clothed, still wearing their robes, tunics, and turbans, and threw them into the blazing fire furnace,
27Dn 3:22 because the king's command was so drastic. Since the furnace was blazing hot, its flames killed those who threw Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego into the blazing fire.
27Dn 3:23 Bound firmly with ropes, these three men Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego fell into the blazing fire furnace.
27Dn 3:24 Astonished, King Nebuchadnezzar stood up in terror, and asked his advisers, "Didn't we throw three men into the fire, bound firmly with ropes? In reply they said to the king, "Yes, your majesty."
27Dn 3:25 "Look!" he told them, "I see four men walking untied and unharmed in the middle of the fire, and the appearance of the fourth resembles a divine being."
27Dn 3:26 Then Nebuchadnezzar approached the opening of the blazing fire furnace. He shouted out, "Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, servants of the Most High God, come out and come here!" So Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego came out of the fire.
27Dn 3:27 The satraps, the viceroys, the governors, and the royal advisors gazed at those men and saw that the fire had no effect on their bodies-not a hair on their head was singed, their clothes were not burned, and they did not smell of fire. 
27Dn 3:28 Nebuchadnezzar spoke up and announced£º 'Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego! He sent his angel to deliver his servants who trusted in him. They disobeyed the king's command and were willing to risk their lives in order not to serve or worship any god except their own God.
27Dn 3:29 So I decree that people from any nation or language who say anything against the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego will be destroyed and their house reduced to rubble, because there is no other god who can save like this.'283
27Dn 3:30 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego within the province of Babylon.29
27Dn 4:1 An Official Statement from Nebuchadnezzar the King To the people of all nations and languages who live on earth. Peace and prosperity to you!
27Dn 4:2 It gives me great pleasure to tell about the signs and wonders that the Most High God has done for me.
27Dn 4:3 How great are his signs! How powerful are his wonders! His kingdom is an eternal kingdom, and his dominion lasts from generation to generation.
27Dn 4:4 I, Nebuchadnezzar, was resting in my home and prospering in my palace.
27Dn 4:5 I had a dream that made me afraid. The thoughts that went through my mind while in bed and the visions in my head terrified me.
27Dn 4:6 So I gave an order to bring in all of the advisors of Babylon so they would tell me the interpretation of the dream.
27Dn 4:7 Then the diviners, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers came in, and I told them the dream. But they could not reveal its interpretation to me.
27Dn 4:8 Eventually, Daniel appeared before me. (He is called Belteshazzar, in accordance with the name of my god, and the spirit of the holy gods is within him.) I told him my dream£º 
27Dn 4:9 "Belteshazzar, chief of the diviners, since I know that the spirit of the holy gods is within you, and no mystery too difficult for you, explain to me the vision of my dream that I saw, along with its interpretation.
27Dn 4:10 This is what I saw in the visions of my head while I was in bed£º I was looking and-listen carefully! - I saw a tree in the middle of the earth, the height of which was very great.
27Dn 4:11 The tree grew large, became strong, and its top reached the sky. It could be seen to the ends of the earth.
27Dn 4:12 Its foliage was beautiful, its fruit bountiful, and its food sufficient for everyone. The animals of the field found shade under it, the birds of the sky lived in its branches, and every creature was fed from it.
27Dn 4:13 "Then I saw in the visions of my head while I was in bed-and take careful notice! - I saw a holy observer descend from heaven.
27Dn 4:14 He called out aloud£º 'Cut down the tree and cut off its branches. Strip off its foliage and scatter its fruit. Let the animals get out from under it, and let the birds leave its branches.
27Dn 4:15 Nevertheless, leave the stump and its roots in the ground, but bind it with iron and bronze in the field grass. Let him be drenched with dew from the sky, and let him graze with the animals in the grass of the earth.
27Dn 4:16 Let his mind be changed from that of a man, and let him be given the mind of an animal until seven seasons of time pass by for him.
27Dn 4:17 This order is announced by the observers, and the holy ones declare the verdict, so that the living may know that the Most High is sovereign over human kingdoms and grants them to whomever he desires, and he places the least important of men over them.'14
27Dn 4:18 "This is the dream that I, King Nebuchadnezzar, saw. Belteshazzar, tell me its meaning, since none of the advisors in my kingdom can tell me its interpretation. But you are able to do so because the spirit of the holy gods is in you."
27Dn 4:19 Then Daniel (also known as Belteshazzar) was greatly troubled for a while and was terrified by his thoughts. The king said, "Belteshazzar, don't let the dream or its meaning terrify you." Belteshazzar responded, "Your majesty, if only the dream were about your enemies and its meaning about those who oppose you!
27Dn 4:20 The tree that you saw, which grew large and strong until its top reached the sky and became visible to the whole earth
27Dn 4:21 with beautiful leaves and abundant fruit-enough food for everyone-and under which wild animals of the field found shelter and the birds of the air had nests in its branches - 
27Dn 4:22 it's you, your majesty! You've become great and strong, your greatness has grown to the heavens, and your dominion reaches to the distant parts of the earth.
27Dn 4:23 "Your majesty saw a holy observer descending from heaven and saying, 'Cut down the tree and destroy it, but leave the stump in the ground, along with its roots, bound with iron and bronze in the field grass. Let him be soaked with the dew of the sky and live with the wild animals of the field until seven seasons pass over him.'
27Dn 4:24 "This is the meaning, your majesty, and this is the decree that the Most High has issued against his majesty, the king:
27Dn 4:25 You'll be driven from people, and you'll live among wild animals of the field. You'll eat grass like cattle and be soaked with the dew of the sky while seven years pass you by-until you realize that the Most High is sovereign over human kingdoms and grants them to whomever he desires.
27Dn 4:26 Just as it was ordered for you to leave the stump of the tree in the ground along with its roots, so your kingdom will be restored to you when you realize that Heaven rules over everything.
27Dn 4:27 Therefore, your majesty, may my advice be acceptable to you£º Stop your sinning, do what's right, and put a stop to your wickedness by showing kindness to the oppressed. Perhaps your tranquility will continue."
27Dn 4:28 All of this happened to King Nebuchadnezzar.
27Dn 4:29 About a year later, as the king was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon,
27Dn 4:30 he commented to himself, "Isn't Babylon great?I've built a royal palace in it by my own might and power, for the sake of my majesty."
27Dn 4:31 As the words were being spoken by the king, a voice came forth from heaven£º "King Nebuchadnezzar, this is declared to you£º 'The kingdom has been taken from you!
27Dn 4:32 You're to be driven away from people. You're to live with the wild animals of the field. You are to be made to eat grass like cattle, and seven years will pass you by until you realize that the Most High is sovereign over human kingdoms and grants them to whomever he desires.'
27Dn 4:33 The decree was fulfilled against Nebuchadnezzar immediately. He was driven away from people to eat grass like cattle, and his body was drenched with dew from the sky, until his hair grew like eagles' feathers and his nails like birds' claws."
27Dn 4:34 "When that period of time was over, I, Nebuchadnezzar, lifted my eyes to heaven and my sanity returned to me. I blessed the Most High, praising and honoring the one who lives forever£º For his sovereignty is eternal, and his kingdom continues from generation to generation.
27Dn 4:35 All who live on the earth are nothing compared to him. He does what he wishes with the heavenly armies and with those who live on earth. No one can hold back his power or say to him, 'What did you do?
27Dn 4:36 At that moment I recovered my sanity, and my honor and majesty returned to me, for the sake of my kingdom. My advisors and officials sought me out, my throne was restored, and even more greatness than I had before was added to me.
27Dn 4:37 "In conclusion, I, Nebuchad¡©nezzar, praise, exalt, and give glory to the King of heaven£º For everything he does is true, his ways are just, and he is able to humble those who walk in pride."
27Dn 5:1 King Belshazzar put on a great feast for a thousand of his officials. He joined all one thousand of them in getting drunk.
27Dn 5:2 Under the influence of wine, Belshazzar ordered that the gold and silver vessels his grandfather Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the temple in Jerusalem be brought in so the king, his officials, his wives, and his mistresses could drink from them.
27Dn 5:3 As ordered, they brought in the gold vessels that had been taken from the sanctuary of God's temple in Jerusalem, and the king, his officials, his wives, and mistresses drank from them.
27Dn 5:4 As they drank the wine, they praised gods of gold, silver, bronze, iron, wood, and stone.
27Dn 5:5 At that moment, humanlike fingers of a hand appeared near the lamp stand of the royal palace and wrote on the plaster of the wall.
27Dn 5:6 While the king watched the back of the hand as it was writing, his facial expression changed. Utterly frightened, he lost control of his bowels and his knees knocked together.
27Dn 5:7 The king cried out to bring in the enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers. He announced to the advisors of Babylon, "Whoever can read this writing and tell me its meaning will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain placed around his neck, and will become the third highest ruler in the kingdom."
27Dn 5:8 Then all the king's advisors came in, but they were unable to read the writing or tell the king what it meant.
27Dn 5:9 So King Belshazzar became even more frightened, and his facial expression showed it. His officials also were thrown into confusion.
27Dn 5:10 Hearing the voices of the king and his officials, the queen entered the banquet hall. "Your majesty, live forever," the queen said. "Don't be frightened by your thoughts or allow your facial expression to show it.
27Dn 5:11 There's a man in your kingdom in whom dwells the spirit of the holy gods. During your grandfather's reign, he was found to have insight, intelligence, and wisdom, like that of the gods. Your grandfather, King Nebuchadnezzar-your kingly predecessor-appointed him to be chief administrator over the magicians, enchanters, Chaldeans, and astrologers,
27Dn 5:12 because he was found to have an extraordinary spirit, knowledge, and understanding, along with an ability to interpret dreams, explain riddles, and solve difficult problems. His name is Daniel, whom the king renamed Belteshazzar. Call for Daniel, and he will reveal the meaning of the writing."
27Dn 5:13 Then Daniel was brought before the king. The king spoke up and said to Daniel, "So you are Daniel, one of the Judean exiles whom my grandfather the king brought from Judah!
27Dn 5:14 I've heard about you, that a spirit of the gods is in you and that you have insight, discernment, and extraordinary wisdom.
27Dn 5:15 Take note that the advisors and enchanters were brought before me to read the writing and explain its meaning, but they were unable to do so.
27Dn 5:16 However, I've heard that you can provide meaning and interpretation, and that you can solve difficult problems. If you are able to read the writing and report its meaning, you will be clothed in purple, have a gold chain placed around your neck, and you will become the third highest ruler in the kingdom."
27Dn 5:17 At this, Daniel answered, speaking directly to the king, "Let your gifts and rewards be given to someone else. However, I'll read the writing for the king and tell him its meaning.
27Dn 5:18 Your majesty, the Most High God gave your grandfather Nebuchadnezzar sovereignty, as well as greatness, glory, and splendor.
27Dn 5:19 And because of the greatness that he gave him, all peoples, nations, and languages revered and feared him. He executed those whom he desired to execute, he spared those whom he wished to spare, he promoted those whom he desired to promote, and he humbled those whom he wished to humble.
27Dn 5:20 But when he became arrogant and his spirit hardened, he was removed from his royal throne and his glory was taken away from him.
27Dn 5:21 He was driven away from human society and given the mind of an animal. He lived with wild donkeys, ate grass like cattle, and his body was soaked with dew from the sky until he realized that the Most High God is sovereign over human kingdoms and places over them whomever he desires.
27Dn 5:22 "But you, Belshazzar, his grandson, haven't humbled yourself, even though you knew all of this.
27Dn 5:23 "You've exalted yourself against the Lord of heaven. "You've had the vessels from his temple brought into your presence. "And you, your officials, and your wives and mistresses drank wine from them. "You praised gods of silver, gold, bronze, iron, wood, and stone, which can't see, hear, or de monstrate knowledge. "But you didn't honor God, who holds in his power your very life and all your ways. 
27Dn 5:24 "Therefore, the hand that wrote this inscription was sent from his presence.
27Dn 5:25 This is the written inscription£º MENE, MENE, TEKEL and PARSIN
27Dn 5:26 These are the meanings of the words£º MENE£º God has audited your kingdom-and has ended it.
27Dn 5:27 TEKEL£º You've been weighed on the scales-and you don't measure up.
27Dn 5:28 PERES£º Your kingdom has been divided-and will be given to the Medes and Persians."
27Dn 5:29 Then Belshazzar gave orders to clothe Daniel in purple, to place a chain of gold around his neck, and to proclaimed him the third highest ruler of the kingdom.
27Dn 5:30 That night Belshazzar, king of the Chaldeans, was killed,
27Dn 5:31 and Darius the Mede took over the kingdom at the age of 62.
27Dn 6:1 It pleased Darius to appoint 20 satraps over the kingdom throughout the realm,
27Dn 6:2 along with three chief administrators from them, one of which was Daniel. The satraps reported to these three administrators, so that the king would experience no losses.
27Dn 6:3 Daniel distinguished himself among all the administrators and satraps, because he was of an extraordinary spirit. Therefore the king planned to appoint him over the whole kingdom.
27Dn 6:4 Because of this, the administrators and satraps tried to bring allegations of dereliction of duty in government affairs against Daniel, but they were unable to find any charges of corruption. Daniel was trustworthy, and no evidence of negligence or corruption could be found against him.
27Dn 6:5 So these men said, "We'll never find any basis for complaint against Daniel unless we build it on the requirements of his God."
27Dn 6:6 Then these administrators and satraps went as a group to the king and said this, "Your majesty, live forever!
27Dn 6:7 All of the royal administrators, prefects, satraps, scribes, and governors have concluded that the king should establish and enforce an edict that anyone who prays to any god or man for the next 30 days (except to you, your majesty) shall be thrown into the lions' pit.
27Dn 6:8 Therefore, your majesty, establish the decree and sign the written document so it can't be changed, in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians that can't be repealed."
27Dn 6:9 So King Darius signed the edict contained in the written document.7
27Dn 6:10 When Daniel learned that the written document had been signed, he went to an upstairs room in his house that had windows opened facing Jerusalem. Three times a day he would kneel down, pray, and give thanks to his God, just as he had previously done.
27Dn 6:11 The conspirators then went as a group and found Daniel praying and seeking help before his God.
27Dn 6:12 So they approached the king and asked, "Didn't you sign an edict that for the next 30 days if anyone prays to any god or man, except to you, your majesty, he would be thrown into the lions' pit? The king responded, "The decree has been established, in accordance with the laws of the Medes and Persians that can't be repealed."
27Dn 6:13 Then they said to the king, "Daniel, who is one of the Judean exiles, pays no attention to you, your majesty, or to the written decree, since he is still praying three times a day."
27Dn 6:14 When the king heard this, he was greatly upset, because he was determined to make every effort to save Daniel before the sun set.
27Dn 6:15 But the men who had gone as a group to the king said to him, "Remember, your majesty, that according to the laws of the Medes and Persians, any decree or edict that the king establishes cannot be repealed."
27Dn 6:16 At this point, the king ordered Daniel brought in and thrown into the lions' pit. The king spoke to Daniel, "Your God, whom you serve constantly, will deliver you himself."
27Dn 6:17 A stone was brought and placed over the opening to the pit, and the king affixed a seal to it with his personal signet ring and with the signet rings of his officials so that no one would interfere with Daniel's situation.
27Dn 6:18 Then the king retired to his palace to spend the night fasting. He enjoyed no entertainment, and he couldn't sleep.
27Dn 6:19 The king got up at dawn and went quickly to the lions' pit.
27Dn 6:20 As he approached where Daniel was in the pit, he cried out to him in a voice filled with anguish, "Daniel, servant of the living God, has your God, whom you serve constantly, been able to deliver you from the lions?
27Dn 6:21 Daniel replied to the king, "May your majesty live forever!
27Dn 6:22 My God sent his angel and sealed the mouths of the lions. They have not harmed me, proving that I'm innocent before him. Also against you, your majesty, I've committed no offense."
27Dn 6:23 The king was ecstatic, so he gave orders for Daniel to be released from the pit. Daniel was taken up from the pit, and no injury was found to have been inflicted on him, because he had believed in his God.
27Dn 6:24 Then the king gave orders to bring those men who had tried to have Daniel devoured, and they threw them, their children, and their wives into the lions' pit. They had not reached the floor of the pit before the lions had overtaken them and crushed all their bones.
27Dn 6:25 Afterward, King Darius wrote to all peoples, nations, and languages who lived throughout his realm£º "May great prosperity be yours!
27Dn 6:26 "I hereby decree that in every area of my kingdom men are to fear and tremble before the God of Daniel. For he is the living God, who endures forever. His kingdom is one that will not be destroyed, and his dominion continues forever.
27Dn 6:27 He delivers and rescues and performs signs and wonders in heaven and on earth. He has delivered Daniel from the power of the lions."
27Dn 6:28 Daniel achieved success during the reigns of Darius and Cyrus the Persian.
27Dn 7:1 In the first year of the reign of King Belshazzar of Babylon, Daniel dreamed a dream, receiving visions in his mind while in bed, after which he recorded the dream, relating this summary of events.
27Dn 7:2 Daniel said, "I observed the vision during the night. Look! The four winds of the skies were stirring up the Mediterranean Sea.
27Dn 7:3 Four magnificent animals were rising from the sea, each different from the other.
27Dn 7:4 The first resembled a lion, but it had eagles' wings. I continued to watch until its wings were plucked off, it was lifted up off the ground, and it was forced to stand on two feet like a man. A human soul was imparted to it.
27Dn 7:5 "Then look! - a second animal resembling a bear followed it. It was raised up on one side, with three ribs held between the teeth in its mouth. Therefore people kept telling it, 'Get up and devour lots of meat!'
27Dn 7:6 "After this I continued to watch - and look! - there was another one, resembling a leopard with four birds' wings on its back. The animal also had four heads, and authority was imparted to it.
27Dn 7:7 "After this, I continued to observe the night visions. And look! - there was a fourth awe-inspiring, terrifying, and viciously strong animal! It had large, iron teeth. It devoured and crushed things, and trampled under its feet whatever remained. Different from all of the other previous animals, it had ten horns.
27Dn 7:8 "While I was thinking about the horns-look-another horn, this time a little one, grew up among them. Three of the first horns were yanked up by their roots right in front of it. Look! It had eyes like those of a human being and a mouth that boasted with audacious claims."
27Dn 7:9 "I kept on watching until the Ancient of Days was seated. His clothes were white, like snow, and the hair on his head was like pure wool. His throne burned with flaming fire, and its wheels burned with fire.
27Dn 7:10 A river of fire flowed out from before him. Thousands upon thousands were serving him, with millions upon millions waiting before him. The court sat in judgment, and record books were unsealed.
27Dn 7:11 "I continued watching because of the audacious words that the horn was speaking. I kept observing until the animal was killed and its body destroyed and given over to burning fire.
27Dn 7:12 Now as to the other animals, their authority was removed, but they were granted a reprieve from execution for an appointed period of time."
27Dn 7:13 "I continued to observe the night vision-and look!-someone like the Son of Man was coming, accompanied by heavenly clouds. He approached the Ancient of Days and was presented before him.
27Dn 7:14 To him dominion was bestowed, along with glory and a kingdom, so that all peoples, nations, and languages shall serve him. His dominion is an everlasting dominion-it shall never pass away-and his kingdom is one that shall never be destroyed."
27Dn 7:15 "Now as for me, Daniel, I was emotionally troubled, and what I had seen in the visions kept alarming me.
27Dn 7:16 So I approached one of those who were standing nearby and began to ask the meaning of all of this. He spoke to me and caused me to understand the interpretation of these things.
27Dn 7:17 He said, 'These four great animals are four kings who will rise to power from the earth.
27Dn 7:18 But the saints of the Highest will receive the kingdom forever, inheriting it forever and ever.'
27Dn 7:19 "I wanted to learn the precise significance of the fourth animal that was different from all the others, extremely awe-inspiring, with iron teeth and bronze claws, and that had devoured and crushed things, trampling under its feet whatever remained.
27Dn 7:20 Also, I wanted to learn the significance of the ten horns on its head and the other horn that had arisen, before which three of them had fallen-that is, the horn with eyes and a mouth that uttered magnificent things and which was greater in appearance than its fellows.
27Dn 7:21 "As I continued to watch, that same horn waged war against the saints, and was prevailing against them
27Dn 7:22 until the Ancient of Days arrived to pass judgment in favor of the saints of the Highest One and the time came for the saints to take possession of the kingdom.
27Dn 7:23 So he said£º 'The fourth animal will be a fourth kingdom on the earth, different from all the kingdoms. It will devour the entire earth, trampling it down and crushing it.
27Dn 7:24 Now as to the ten horns, ten kings will rise to power from this kingdom, and another king will rise to power after them. He will be different from the previous kings, and will defeat three kings.
27Dn 7:25 He'll speak out against the Most High and wear down the saints of the Highest One. He'll attempt to alter times and laws, and they'll be given into his control for a time, times, and half a time.
27Dn 7:26 Nevertheless, the court will convene, and his authority will be removed, annulled, and destroyed forever.
27Dn 7:27 Then the kingdom, authority, and magnificence of all nations of the earth will be given to the people who are the saints of the Highest One. His kingdom will endure forever, and all authorities will serve him and obey him.'
27Dn 7:28 "At this point the vision ended. As for me, Daniel, my thoughts continued to alarm me, and I lost my natural color, but I kept quiet about the matter."
27Dn 8:1 "During the third year of King Belshazzar's reign, I, Daniel, saw a vision after the earlier vision that had appeared to me.
27Dn 8:2 As I observed the vision, I looked around the citadel of Susa in Elam Province. While I watched, I found myself beside the Ulai Canal.
27Dn 8:3 "Then I turned my head to look-and behold! - a two-horned ram was standing beside the canal. The two horns grew long, the first one growing longer than the second, with the longer one springing up last.
27Dn 8:4 I watched the ram charging westward, northward, and southward. No animal could stand before him, nor was there anyone who could deliver from his control. He did as he pleased and exalted himself.3
27Dn 8:5 "As I watched and wondered, a male goat was coming from the west over the surface of the entire earth without touching the ground. The goat had a distinctive horn between its eyes.
27Dn 8:6 It approached the ram with the two horns that I had observed while standing beside the canal, and charged at him, out of control with rage.
27Dn 8:7 I saw it approach the ram, overflowing with fury at him, and run into him with the full force of its strength. The goat shattered the ram's two horns, and the ram could not oppose it. So the goat threw him to the ground and trampled him. No one could rescue the ram from its control.
27Dn 8:8 Then the goat grew extremely great, but when it was strong, its great horn was shattered. In its place, four distinctive horns grew out in all directions."
27Dn 8:9 "A somewhat insignificant horn emerged from one of them. It moved rapidly against the south, against the east, and against the Glory.
27Dn 8:10 Then it moved against the heavenly army. It persuaded some of the army to fall to the earth, along with some of the stars, and it trampled them.
27Dn 8:11 Then it set itself as great as the Prince of the army, from whom the daily ritual was abolished, in order to bring low his sanctuary.
27Dn 8:12 Because of the transgression, the army will be given over, along with the daily ritual, and the horn will cast truth to the ground, prospering while it continues to act."
27Dn 8:13 "Then I heard one holy person speaking, and another holy person addressed the one who was speaking£º 'In the vision about the daily ritual, how much time elapses while the desecration terrifies and both the holy place and the army are trampled?
27Dn 8:14 He said to me, 'For 2,300 days. Then what is holy will be restored.'"
27Dn 8:15 "After I, Daniel, had seen the vision, I tried to understand it. All of a sudden, there was standing in front of me one who appeared to be valiant.
27Dn 8:16 I heard the voice of a man calling out from the Ulai Canal, 'Gabriel, interpret what that fellow has been seeing.'
27Dn 8:17 "As he approached where I was standing, I became terrified and fell on my face. But he said to me, 'Son of man, understand that the vision pertains to the time of the end.'
27Dn 8:18 "While he had been speaking with me, I had fainted on my face, but he touched me and enabled me to stand upright on my feet.
27Dn 8:19 Then he said, 'Pay attention! I'm going to brief you about what will happen at the end of the period of wrath, because its end is appointed.
27Dn 8:20 The ram that you saw with a pair of horns are the kings of Media and Persia.
27Dn 8:21 The demonic goat is the king of Greece, and the great horn between its eyes is its first king.
27Dn 8:22 The shattered horn and the four that took its place are four kingdoms that will come from his nation, but they will not have his strength.
27Dn 8:23 Toward the end of their rule, as the desecrations proceed, an insolent king will arise, proficient at deception.
27Dn 8:24 Mighty will be his skills, but not from his own abilities. He'll be remarkably destructive, will succeed, and will do whatever he wants, destroying mighty men and the holy people.
27Dn 8:25 Through his skill he'll cause deceit to prosper under his leadership. He'll promote himself and will destroy many while they are secure. He'll take a stand against the Prince of Princes, yet he'll be crushed without human help.
27Dn 8:26 The vision about the twilights and dawnings that has been related is trustworthy, but keep its vision secret, because it pertains to the distant future.'823
27Dn 8:27 Then I, Daniel, was exhausted and ill for days, but afterward I got up and went about the king's business. Nevertheless, I was astonished by the vision, and could not understand it."
27Dn 9:1 "In the first year of the reign of Darius son of Ahasuerus, a descendant of the Medes, who was made king over the kingdom of the Chaldeans - 
27Dn 9:2 in the first year of his reign I, Daniel, noted in the Scripture the total years that were assigned by the word of the Lord to Jeremiah the prophet for the completion of the desolations of Jerusalem£º 70 years.
27Dn 9:3 "So I turned my attention to the Lord God, seeking him in prayer and supplication, accompanied with fasting, sackcloth, and ashes.
27Dn 9:4 I prayed to the Lord my God, confessing and saying£º Lord! Great and awesome God, who keeps his covenant and gracious love for those who love him and obey his commandments,
27Dn 9:5 we've sinned, we've practiced evil, we've acted wickedly, and we've rebelled, turning away from your commands and from your regulations.
27Dn 9:6 Furthermore, we haven't listened to your servants, the prophets, who spoke in your name to our kings, to our officials, to our ancestors, and to all of the people of the land.
27Dn 9:7 To you, Lord, belongs righteousness, but to us, open humiliation-even to this day, to the men of Judah, the residents of Jerusalem, and to all Israel, both those who are nearby and those who are far away in all the lands to which you drove them because of their unfaithful acts that they committed against you.
27Dn 9:8 Open humiliation belongs to us, Lord, to our kings, our officials, and our ancestors, because we've sinned against you.
27Dn 9:9 But to the Lord our God belong mercy and forgiveness, though we've rebelled against him
27Dn 9:10 and have not obeyed the voice of the Lord our God by walking in his laws that he gave us through his servants the prophets.
27Dn 9:11 And all Israel flouted your law, turning aside from it and not obeying your voice. Because we've sinned against him, the curse has been poured upon us, along with the oath written in the Law of Moses the servant of God.
27Dn 9:12 He has confirmed his accusation that he spoke against us and against our rulers who governed us by bringing upon us great calamity, because nowhere in the universe has anything been done like what has been done to Jerusalem.
27Dn 9:13 As it's written in the Law of Moses, all this calamity has befallen us, but we still haven't sought the Lord our God by turning from our lawlessness to pay attention to your truth.
27Dn 9:14 So the Lord watched for the right time to bring the calamity upon us, because the Lord our God is righteous regarding everything he does, but we have not obeyed his voice.13
27Dn 9:15 And now, Lord our God, who brought your people from the land of Egypt with a mighty hand and who made a name for yourself that remains to this day - we've sinned. We've acted wickedly.
27Dn 9:16 Lord, in view of all your righteous acts, please turn your anger and wrath away from your city Jerusalem, your holy mountain. Because of our sins and the iniquities of our ancestors, Jerusalem and your people have become an embarrassment to all of those around us.
27Dn 9:17 So now, O God, listen to the prayer of your servant and to his requests, and look with favor on your desolate sanctuary, for the sake of the Lord.
27Dn 9:18 Lord, turn your ear and listen. Open your eyes and look at our desolation and at the city that is called by your name. We're not presenting our requests before you because of our righteousness, but because of your great compassion.
27Dn 9:19 Lord, listen! Lord, forgive! Lord, take note and take action! For your own sake, don't delay, my God, because your city and your people are called by your name."
27Dn 9:20 "While I was still speaking in prayer, confessing my sin and the sin of my people Israel and placing my request in the presence of the Lord my God on behalf of the holy mountain of God - 
27Dn 9:21 while I was still speaking, Gabriel the man of God whom I had seen in the previous vision, appeared to me about the time of the evening offering.
27Dn 9:22 He gave instructions, and this is what he spoke to me£º 'Daniel, I've now come to give you insight and understanding.
27Dn 9:23 Because you're highly regarded, the answer was issued when you began your prayer, and I've come to tell you. Pay attention to my message and you'll understand the vision.
27Dn 9:24 Seventy weeks have been decreed concerning your people and your holy city£º to restrain transgression, to put an end to sin, to make atonement for lawlessness, to establish everlasting righteousness, to conclude vision and prophecy, and to anoint the holy of holies.
27Dn 9:25 So be informed and discern that seven weeks and
27Dn 9:62 weeks will elapse from the issuance of the command to restore and rebuild Jerusalem until the anointed commander. The street will be rebuilt, along with the wall, though in troubled times. 
27Dn 9:26 Then after the 62 weeks, the anointed one will be cut off, and will have no successor. Then the people of the coming commander will destroy both the city and the Sanctuary. Its ending will come like a flood, and until the end there will be war, with desolations having been decreed.
27Dn 9:27 He will make a binding covenant with many for one week, and for half of the week he will pause both the sacrifice and grain offerings. Destructive people will cause desolation on the pinnacle until it is complete and what has been decreed is poured out on the desolator.'"
27Dn 10:1 In the third year of Cyrus, king of Persia, a message was revealed to Daniel (also known as Belteshazzar). The message was trustworthy and concerned a great conflict. He understood it and had insight concerning the vision.
27Dn 10:2 "At that time I, Daniel, had been mourning for three straight weeks.
27Dn 10:3 I ate no fancy foods-neither meat nor wine entered my mouth. Furthermore, I didn't use any ointment until the end of the entire three weeks.
27Dn 10:4 On the twenty-fourth day of the first month, while I was beside the bank of the great Tigris River,
27Dn 10:5 I lifted up my eyes to look-and behold!-there was a certain man dressed in linen, whose waist was encircled with gold from Uphaz.
27Dn 10:6 His body was like beryl, his face flashed like lightning, his eyes were like flaming torches, his arms and legs were like polished bronze, and his speech roared like that of a crowd.
27Dn 10:7 "Now I, Daniel, was the only one to receive the vision-the men who were with me didn't see it. However, an enormous fear overwhelmed them, so they ran away to hide,
27Dn 10:8 and I was left alone to observe this magnificent vision. Nevertheless, no strength remained in me-my face lost its color, and I became weak.
27Dn 10:9 As I listened to the sound of his words, I fell down on my face unconscious, with my face to the ground."
27Dn 10:10 "All of a sudden, a hand touched me and lifted me upon my hands and knees.
27Dn 10:11 He said to me, 'Daniel, man highly regarded, understand the message that I'm about to relate to you. Stand up, because I've been sent to you.' When he spoke this statement to me, I stood there trembling.
27Dn 10:12 "'Don't be afraid, Daniel," he told me, "because from the first day that you committed yourself to understand and to humble yourself before your God, your words were heard. I've come in answer to your prayers.
27Dn 10:13 However, the prince of the kingdom of Persia opposed me for 21 days. Then-look!-Michael, one of the chief angels, came to assist me. I had been detained there near the kings of Persia.
27Dn 10:14 Now I've come to help you understand what will happen to your people in the days to come, because the vision pertains to those days.'
27Dn 10:15 "After he had spoken to me like this, I bowed my face to the ground, unable to speak.
27Dn 10:16 But all of a sudden someone who resembled a human being touched my lips, so I opened my mouth and spoke, addressing the one who was standing in front of me£º 'Sir, I'm overwhelmed with anguish by this vision. I have no strength left.
27Dn 10:17 So how can a servant of my lord talk with someone like you, sir?And as for me, there's no strength left in me, and I can hardly breathe.'
27Dn 10:18 "Then this person who looked like a man touched me again and strengthened me
27Dn 10:19 and said, 'Don't be afraid, man highly regarded. Be at peace, and be strong.' "As soon as he spoke to me, I gained strength and replied, 'Sir, please speak, now that you've strengthened me.'
27Dn 10:20 "Then he said, 'Do you understand why I came to you?Soon I'll return to fight the prince of Persia. I'm going forth to war-and take note-the prince of Greece is coming.
27Dn 10:21 I'll inform you about what has been recorded in the Book of Truth. No one stands firmly with me against these opponents, except Michael your prince.
27Dn 11:1 In year one of King Darius the Mede, I arose to fortify and strengthen him.'"10
27Dn 11:2 "'Now I'll tell you the truth£º Look! Three more kings will arise in Persia. Then a fourth will gain more than them all. As soon as he gains power by means of his wealth, he'll stir up everyone against the Grecian kingdoms.
27Dn 11:3 "'A mighty king will come to power, and he'll rule with awesome energy, doing whatever he pleases. 
27Dn 11:4 However, after he has come to power, his kingdom will be broken and parceled out in all directions. It will not go to his succeeding descendants, nor will its power match how he ruled, because his sovereignty will be uprooted and given to successors besides them.
27Dn 11:5 "'The southern king will become strong, along with one of his officials, who will become stronger than he and rule over his own realm with great power.
27Dn 11:6 After a number of years, they'll become allies and the daughter of the southern king will go to the northern king in order to craft alliances. But she won't remain in power, nor will he retain his power. Instead, she'll be surrendered, along with her entourage, the one who fathered her, and the one who supported her at that time.
27Dn 11:7 "'One of her family line will replace him. He'll come against the army and enter the fortress of the northern king, conquering them and becoming victorious.
27Dn 11:8 He'll also take their gods, their molten images, and their valuable vessels of silver and gold into Egypt as hostages. He'll avoid the northern king for a number of years.
27Dn 11:9 Then he'll come against the realm of the southern king and then return to his own territory.
27Dn 11:10 His sons will prepare for war, assembling an army of considerable force. One of them will come on forcefully, overflowing, passing through, and waging war up to his own fortress.
27Dn 11:11 "'The southern king will fly into a rage and march out to fight the northern king. He'll gather a large army, but that army will be handed over to him.
27Dn 11:12 When that army has been defeated, he'll become overconfident and slaughter many thousands, but he won't succeed.
27Dn 11:13 The northern king will return and raise a greater army than before. After a few years he'll advance with a great force and with a vast amount of armaments.'"
27Dn 11:14 "'During those years, many will rebel against the southern king. The more violent ones among your people will rebel in order to fulfill this vision, but they will fail.
27Dn 11:15 Then the northern king will come, erect a siege ramp, and capture a fortified city. The southern forces won't prevail-not even with their best troops - and they'll have no strength to take a stand.
27Dn 11:16 "'However, the one who invades him will do whatever he wants to do. No one will oppose him. He'll establish himself in the Beautiful Land, wielding devastating power.
27Dn 11:17 He'll decide to come with the full power of his kingdom, bringing with him an alliance that he'll implement. He'll give him a daughter in marriage to overthrow it, but it won't succeed or work out for him.
27Dn 11:18 Then he'll turn his attention to the coastal lands and will capture many. But a commander will put an end to his insolence, repaying him for his scorn.
27Dn 11:19 He'll turn his attention toward the fortresses in his own territory, but he'll stumble and fall, and won't endure.
27Dn 11:20 "'His successor will send out a tax collector for royal splendor, but in a short period of time he'll be shattered, though neither in anger nor in battle.'"
27Dn 11:21 "'In his place there will arise a despicable person, upon whom no royal authority has been conferred, but he'll invade in a time of tranquility, taking over the kingdom through deception.
27Dn 11:22 Overwhelming forces will be carried away before him, along with the commander-in-chief of the covenant.
27Dn 11:23 From the time that an alliance is made with him, he'll act deceitfully, and he will go up and take power with only a small group of nations.
27Dn 11:24 He'll invade the most prosperous areas of the province during a time of tranquility, accomplishing what neither his predecessors nor his ancestors ever could. He'll distribute war spoils, booty, and wealth to them, and he'll plot the overthrow of fortresses, though only for a time.
27Dn 11:25 He'll encourage himself against the southern king by raising a large army. As a result, the southern king will mobilize for war with a large and powerful army, but he won't succeed because they will devise elaborate schemes against him.
27Dn 11:26 His own security detail will undermine him, his army will be swept away, and many will fall and be killed in battle.24
27Dn 11:27 "'Now as for the two kings, their intentions will be evil, and they'll promote deception at their dinner table, but none of this will succeed, because the end won't have come yet.
27Dn 11:28 Then he'll return to his homeland with great wealth, will focus his attention against the holy covenant, and will take action as he returns to his land.'"
27Dn 11:29 "'At the scheduled time he'll return, moving southward, but the end result won't be as before,
27Dn 11:30 because ships will come against him from the Mediterranean islands. Disheartened, he'll return, incited to vehemence against the holy covenant, and he'll take action. As he returns, he'll show deference to those who abandon the holy covenant.
27Dn 11:31 Armed forces will arise from his midst, and they'll desecrate the fortified Sanctuary, abolish the daily sacrifice, and establish the destructive desecration.
27Dn 11:32 Through flattery he'll corrupt those who act wickedly toward the covenant, but people who know their God will be strong and take action.
27Dn 11:33 Insightful people will impart understanding to many, though they'll fall by sword, by fire, by captivity, and as war booty for a while.
27Dn 11:34 When they fall, they'll be given some relief, but many will join them by pretending to be sympathetic to their cause.
27Dn 11:35 Some of the insightful will fall so they may be refined, purged, and purified until the time of the end, since it will surely come about.'"
27Dn 11:36 "'The king will do as he pleases. He'll exalt and magnify himself above every god, speaking amazing things against the God of Gods. He'll succeed until the indignation is completed, because what has been determined must be carried out.
27Dn 11:37 He'll recognize neither the gods of his ancestors nor those desired by women - he won't recognize any god, because he'll exalt himself above everything.
27Dn 11:38 He'll glorify the god of fortresses, a god whom his ancestors never knew, honoring him with gold, silver, valuable jewels, and treasures.
27Dn 11:39 He'll take action against the strongest fortresses. With the help of a foreign god, he'll recognize those who honor him, making them rule over many, and he'll parcel out the land for a profit.11
27Dn 11:40 "'At the time of the end, the southern king will oppose him, and the northern king will overrun him with chariots, cavalry, and many ships. He'll invade countries, moving swiftly and sweeping through.
27Dn 11:41 He'll enter the Beautiful Land, and many will fall, even though these will escape his control£º Edom, Moab, and certain Ammonite officials.
27Dn 11:42 He'll extend his power over other countries, and even the land of Egypt won't escape.
27Dn 11:43 He'll capture treasures of gold, silver, and all the treasures of Egypt with the Libyans and Cushites at his feet.
27Dn 11:44 However, reports from the east and the north will alarm him, and he'll march out in great anger, intending to destroy and to desolate many.
27Dn 11:45 When he pitches his royal pavilions between the seas facing the mountain of holy Glory, he'll come to his end, and no one will help him.'"
27Dn 12:1 "'At that time Michael will arise, the great prince who will stand up on behalf of your people, and a time of trouble will come like there has never been since nations began until that time. Also at that time, your people will be delivered?everyone who will have been written in the book.
27Dn 12:2 Many of those who are sleeping in the dust of the earth will awaken - some to life everlasting, and some to disgrace and everlasting contempt.
27Dn 12:3 Those who manifest wisdom will shine like the brightness of the expanse of heaven, and those who turn many to righteousness will shine like the stars for ever and ever.
27Dn 12:4 Now as for you, Daniel, roll up your scroll and seal your words until the time of the end. Many will rush around while knowledge increases.'"
27Dn 12:5 "Then I, Daniel, continued watching-and look!-two others stood there, one on this side of the river bank and the other on the other side of the river bank.
27Dn 12:6 One asked the man dressed in linen clothes, who was standing above the waters of the river, 'How long until the fulfillment of the wonders?
27Dn 12:7 "I heard the man dressed in linen clothes, who was standing above the waters of the river as he lifted his right and left hands to heaven and swore by the one who lives forever that it would be for a time, times, and a half. When the shattering of the power of the holy people has occurred, all these things will conclude."
27Dn 12:8 "I heard, but I didn't understand. So I asked, 'Sir, what happens next?
27Dn 12:9 "He answered, 'Go on your way, Daniel, because these matters are wrapped up and sealed until the time of the end.
27Dn 12:10 Many will be purified, cleansed, and refined, though the wicked act wickedly, and none of the wicked understand. Nevertheless, the insightful will understand.
27Dn 12:11 There will be 1,290 days from the time the daily ritual is rescinded and the destructive desolation established.
27Dn 12:12 Blessed is the one who waits and reaches the 1,335 days.
27Dn 12:13 Now as for you, go on your way until the end-you'll rest and then rise to receive your reward at the end of the age.'"

28Hs 1:1 The word of the Lord came to Beeri's son Hosea during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, and during the reign of Joash's son Jeroboam, who was king of Israel.
28Hs 1:2 When the word of the Lord came to Hosea, the Lord said to him, "Go marry a prostitute and have children with her, because the land is prostituting itself by departing from the Lord."
28Hs 1:3 So he went out and married Diblaim's daughter Gomer. She conceived with him and gave birth to a son.
28Hs 1:4 The Lord told Hosea, "Name the child 'Jezreel,' because in a little while I'll avenge the blood that was shed by Jehu's dynasty at Jezreel. I'll put an end to the kingdom of the house of Israel.
28Hs 1:5 At that time I'll shatter the military strength of Israel in the Valley of Jezreel."
28Hs 1:6 Gomer conceived again and gave birth to a daughter, so the Lord told Hosea, "Name her 'Lo-Ruhamah,' because I will no longer be showing mercy to the house of Israel, nor will I forgive them.
28Hs 1:7 But I'll have mercy on the house of Judah, and I'll save them by the Lord their God - I will not save them by the bow, nor by the sword, nor by battle, nor by horses, nor by cavalry."
28Hs 1:8 After Gomer had weaned Lo-Ruhamah, she conceived again and gave birth to a son,
28Hs 1:9 so the Lord told Hosea, "Name him 'Lo-Ammi,' because you are not my people, and I will not be your God.
28Hs 1:10 Despite this, the number of the people of Israel will be like ocean sand, which can neither be measured nor counted. And the time will come when instead of it being said, 'You are not my people,' it will be said, 'You are children of the living God.'
28Hs 1:11 And the people of Judah and the people of Israel will be united as one. They will appoint for themselves a single leader and will take dominion over the land, for great will be the day of Jezreel.
28Hs 2:1 So call your brothers 'Ammi,' and your sisters 'Ruhamah.'"
28Hs 2:2 "Call your mother to account, call her?for she is not my wife, and I'm not her husband. Let her do away with her seductive looks and remove her adultery from between her breasts.
28Hs 2:3 Otherwise, I'll strip her naked?as she was on the day she was born?make her like a wilderness, turn her into a parched land, and cause her to die of thirst.
28Hs 2:4 Furthermore, I'll not show pity on her children, since they are children of prostitution.
28Hs 2:5 Indeed, their mother has committed prostitution?the one who has been conceiving them has acted disgracefully?when she said 'I'm going after my lovers, who provide me food and water, as well as my wool, my flax, my oil, and my wine.'
28Hs 2:6 "Look how I'm blocking her path with thorns and building a wall to hinder her, so she can't find her way.
28Hs 2:7 She will pursue her lovers, but she won't catch up with them. She will seek them, but she won't find them. Then she will say, 'I'll go back and return to my first husband, because it was better for me then than now.'
28Hs 2:8 She didn't recognize that it was I who provided her grain, wine, and oil, and it was I who gave her silver, while they crafted gold for Baal.
28Hs 2:9 "Therefore I'll return and take back my grain at harvest time and my new wine in its season. I'll take back my wool and my flax that was to have covered her nakedness.
28Hs 2:10 So now I'll reveal her lewdness to the eyes of her lovers, and no man will rescue her from my control.
28Hs 2:11 I'll put a stop to her mirth, along with her celebrations, her new moons, her Sabbaths, and all of her festive assemblies.
28Hs 2:12 I'll destroy her vines and her fig trees, about which she said, 'These are the earnings that my lovers paid me. I'll make them grow into a forest, and the wild animals will eat from them.'
28Hs 2:13 I'll punish her for the time she has devoted to the Baals, to whom she burned incense, and for whom she put on her earrings and jewels so she could go after her lovers and forget me," declares the Lord.
28Hs 2:14 "Therefore, look! I will now allure her. I will make her go out to the wilderness, and will speak to her heart.
28Hs 2:15 There I will restore her vineyards to her, and the Valley of Achor will become a doorway to hope. There she will respond as she did in her youth, when she came up from Egypt."
28Hs 2:16 "It will come about at that time," declares the Lord, "that you will address me as 'My husband,' and you will no longer call me 'My master'.
28Hs 2:17 I will remove the names of the Baals from her vocabulary?they will not be remembered by their names anymore.
28Hs 2:18 I will make a covenant with them at that time, a covenant with the wild animals of the field, with the birds of the air, and with the creatures of the ground. I will banish the battle bow, the sword, and war from the earth. I will cause my people to lie down where it is safe.
28Hs 2:19 I will make you my wife forever?I will make you my wife in a way that is righteous, in a manner that is just, by a love that is gracious, and by a motive that is mercy.
28Hs 2:20 I will make you my wife because of my faithfulness, and you will know the Lord.
28Hs 2:21 "It will come about at that time that I will respond," declares the Lord, "I will respond to the heavens, and they will respond to the earth.
28Hs 2:22 The earth will respond with grain, new wine, and oil, and they will respond to Jezreel.
28Hs 2:23 I will plant my people in the land for myself. I will show mercy on her who has received no mercy I will say to those who are not my people, 'You are my people!' and they will say, 'You are my God.'"
28Hs 3:1 Then the Lord said to me£º "Go love your wife again, even though she is being loved by another and is committing adultery. Love her the same way the Lord loves the people of Israel, even though they look to other gods and love raisin cakes."
28Hs 3:2 So I bought her back for myself for fifteen pieces of silver and about ten bushels of barley.
28Hs 3:3 I said to her, "You will remain with me a long time, you won't be promiscuous, you won't be involved with any man, and I'll do the same."
28Hs 3:4 Likewise, the people of Israel will dwell a long time without a king, without a prince, without sacrifice, without sacred pillars, and with neither ephod nor teraphim.
28Hs 3:5 Afterward, the people of Israel will return and seek the Lord their God and David their king. They will come in awe to the Lord and to his goodness in the last days.
28Hs 4:1 "Hear the word of the Lord, people of Israel. Indeed, the Lord brings a charge against the people who live in the land?for there is no truth and no gracious love or knowledge of God in the land.
28Hs 4:2 Swearing, lying, murder, theft, and adultery are rampant, and blood mingles with blood.
28Hs 4:3 Therefore the land will mourn, and all who live there will languish, along with the wild animals of the field and the birds of the air. Even the fish in the sea will disappear.
28Hs 4:4 "Let no one fight or bring charges against another, for my dispute is with you, priest.
28Hs 4:5 So you will stumble during the day, the prophet also will stumble with you at night, and I will destroy your mother.
28Hs 4:6 My people are destroyed because they lack knowledge of me. Because you rejected that knowledge, I will reject you as a priest for me. Since you forget the law of your God, I will also forget your children.
28Hs 4:7 "The more they increased in number, the more they sinned against me, so I will change their glory into shame.
28Hs 4:8 They feed on the sin of my people; they purpose in their heart to transgress.
28Hs 4:9 So it will be£º like people, like priest. I will punish them for their lifestyles, rewarding them according to their behavior.
28Hs 4:10 They will eat, but will not be satisfied. They will engage in prostitution, but they won't increase, because they have stopped listening to the Lord.
28Hs 4:11 "Sexual immorality, wine, and fresh wine seduce the heart of my people.
28Hs 4:12 My people seek counsel from their piece of wood, and their diviner's rod speaks to them. For a spirit of prostitution causes them to go astray; in their immorality they desert their God.
28Hs 4:13 They offer sacrifices on the mountain tops, burning offerings on the hills, under oaks, poplars, and terebinth trees, since their shade is very good. Therefore your daughters are prostitutes and your daughters-in-law commit adultery. 
28Hs 4:14 However, I'm not going to punish your daughters when they commit prostitution, nor your daughters-in-law when they commit adultery, because their men are themselves immoral?they offer sacrifices with prostitutes. These people who aren't discerning will stumble.
28Hs 4:15 "Even though you prostitute yourself, Israel?let not Judah incur guilt?don't go to Gilgal, or visit Beth-aven, or swear an oath using the Lord's name.
28Hs 4:16 For Israel is as obstinate as a stubborn mule! Nevertheless, will not the Lord feed them like a lamb in a broad pasture - 
28Hs 4:17 Ephraim has become entwined with idols; leave him alone!
28Hs 4:18 While drinking to excess, they prostitute themselves. They're in love with dishonor.
28Hs 4:19 A wind storm will carry them away in its embrace, and their sacrifices will bring them shame."
28Hs 5:1 "Hear this, priests, pay attention, house of Israel, listen, royal family! For judgment is coming your way, because you have been a trap to Mizpah, a snare spread out on Mount Tabor.
28Hs 5:2 The rebels are deep into their slaughter; I am punishing them all.
28Hs 5:3 I know Ephraim, and Israel cannot hide from me, since you, Ephraim, have been acting like a prostitute, defiling Israel.
28Hs 5:4 "Their actions hinder them from turning to their God, because a spirit of fornication is in their midst, and the Lord they do not know.
28Hs 5:5 The arrogance of Israel testifies against him; therefore Israel and Ephraim will stumble in their iniquity, and Judah with them.
28Hs 5:6 They will go with their flocks and herds to seek the Lord, but they will not find him; he has withdrawn from them.
28Hs 5:7 They have been unfaithful to the Lord, having raised unbelieving children. In the coming month they will be devoured, along with their fields.
28Hs 5:8 "Sound the trumpet in Gibeah, and the alarm in Ramah. Cry out at Beth-aven Go out, Benjamin!
28Hs 5:9 Ephraim will be desolate when it is rebuked. I have made known among the tribes of Israel what will surely come about.
28Hs 5:10 The princes of Judah have become like those who move boundary markers£º I will pour out my anger on them like water.
28Hs 5:11 Ephraim is crushed, broken by judgment, because he willingly pursued idols.
28Hs 5:12 Therefore I will consume Ephraim like a moth, and the house of Judah as rottenness consumes.
28Hs 5:13 When Ephraim examined his illness and Judah his injury, then Ephraim went to Assyria, and inquired of the great king; but he could not cure you nor heal your injury.
28Hs 5:14 Therefore I will be like a lion to Ephraim, and like a young lion to the house of Judah. I?even I?will tear them to pieces, and then I will leave. I will take them away, and there will be no rescue.
28Hs 5:15 "I will leave and go back to my place until they admit their offense and seek my face. When affliction comes to them, they will eagerly seek me."
28Hs 6:1 "Come, let us return to the Lord; even though he has torn us, he will heal us. Even though he has wounded us, he will bind our wounds.
28Hs 6:2 After two days he will restore us to life, on the third day he will raise us up, and we will live in his presence.
28Hs 6:3 Let us know, let us pursue knowledge of the Lord; his coming is as certain as the dawn. He will come to us like the rain, like the autumn and spring rains come on the earth.
28Hs 6:4 "What am I to do with you, Ephraim?What am I to do with you, Judah?Your love is like a morning rain cloud?it passes away like the morning dew.
28Hs 6:5 Therefore I cut them to pieces by the prophets, killing them by the words from my mouth. The verdict against you shines like a beacon.
28Hs 6:6 For it is love that I seek, and not sacrifice; knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
28Hs 6:7 "But like Adam, they broke the covenant; in this they have acted deceitfully against me.
28Hs 6:8 Gilead is a lawless town; it is polluted by bloodshed.
28Hs 6:9 Like a gang of thieves that stalk a man, priests commit murder along the road to Shechem, committing shameful crimes.
28Hs 6:10 I have seen a horrible evil in the house of Israel?Ephraim's promiscuity. Israel is defiled.
28Hs 6:11 "So, Judah, a harvest has been appointed for you when I restore my people from captivity."
28Hs 7:1 "When I was healing Israel, Ephraim's sin was uncovered, along with Samaria's wickedness. While they craft lying schemes, the thief invades, and the gang of thieves plunders outside.
28Hs 7:2 It never occurs to them that I remember all their sin. Now their actions have caught up with them, and they have my attention.
28Hs 7:3 They please the king with their evil, and the princes with their dishonesty.
28Hs 7:4 All of them are adulterers?they burn like an oven prepared by the baker, who has ceased stoking it until the dough is leavened.
28Hs 7:5 "On the king's festival day the princes got drunk from wine, so the king joined the mockers.
28Hs 7:6 For they have stirred up themselves like an oven as they lie in ambush. Their baker sleeps through the night; in the morning, the oven will be blazing like a fire.
28Hs 7:7 They all burn like an oven; they have consumed their judges; all their kings have fallen?not even one of them calls on me.
28Hs 7:8 "Ephraim compromises with the nations; he's a half-baked cake.
28Hs 7:9 Foreigners have consumed his strength, and he hasn't noticed. Furthermore, his head is sprinkled with gray hair, but he doesn't realize it.
28Hs 7:10 Israel's arrogance testifies against him; but they do not return to the Lord their God, nor seek him in all of this.
28Hs 7:11 "Ephraim is also like a silly dove, lacking sense£º They call out to Egypt, and turn toward Assyria.
28Hs 7:12 When they go, I'll cast my net over them. I'll bring them down, as one shoots birds in the sky. I'll chasten them, as the assembly has already heard.
28Hs 7:13 Woe to them?because they have run away from me. Ruin to them?because they have sinned against me. Even though I redeemed them, they spread lies against me.
28Hs 7:14 They will not cry to me from their heart?instead, they wail on their beds. They gather together to eat and drink, turning away from me.
28Hs 7:15 "Though I have taught them and strengthened their arms, nevertheless they plot evil against me.
28Hs 7:16 They return?but not to the Most High. They are like a defective weapon. Their princes will fall by the sword because of their raging tongue, and they will be a laughingstock in the land of Egypt."
28Hs 8:1 "Sound the ram's horn! Like a vulture the enemy will come against the temple of the Lord, because Israel violated my covenant, transgressing my law.
28Hs 8:2 They cry out to me, 'God, we of Israel acknowledge you.'
28Hs 8:3 "Israel has discarded what is good. The enemy will pursue them.
28Hs 8:4 They set kings in place, but not by me. They established princes, whom I did not recognize. They crafted idols for themselves from their silver and gold; as a result, they will be destroyed.
28Hs 8:5 Your calf, Samaria, has been thrown away. My anger is burning against them. How long until they become pure again - 
28Hs 8:6 Because from Israel it was fashioned by craftsmen, it is not God; therefore Samaria's calf will be broken in pieces.
28Hs 8:7 "Because they sow the wind, they will reap the wind storm. The plant has no stalk and its bud yields no grain. Even if there's a harvest, foreigners will gobble it up.
28Hs 8:8 Israel has been devoured; now they will live among the nations like a worthless container.
28Hs 8:9 "Because they went over to Assyria, they are like a wild donkey alone by itself. Ephraim has hired some lovers.
28Hs 8:10 Even though they sold themselves to the nations, I will gather them. They will mourn for a while for the burden they were to the king and princes.
28Hs 8:11 "The more altars Ephraim builds for sin, the more altars there will be for sin.
28Hs 8:12 I prescribed great things from my law for them, but they considered them profane.
28Hs 8:13 They offer me meat from the sacrifices of my offerings, and they eat from it, but the Lord does not accept them. He will now remember their transgression and pay them back for their sins; to Egypt they will return.
28Hs 8:14 "Israel has neglected its maker in building palaces. Judah has multiplied its fortified cities, but I will send fire to their cities, and it will consume their fortresses."
28Hs 9:1 "Don't celebrate, Israel, like other nations would rejoice, because you left your God by committing fornication, loving the profit you gained on all of the threshing floors.
28Hs 9:2 Neither threshing floor nor winepress will sustain them, and the new wine will disappoint her.
28Hs 9:3 They will not live in the Lord's land?Ephraim will return to Egypt, and they will eat unclean food in Assyria.
28Hs 9:4 They won't present wine offerings to the Lord, nor will they please him. Their sacrifices will seem like food for mourners?everyone who eats them will become unclean; none of them will enter the temple of the Lord.
28Hs 9:5 "What will you do on the designated holiday, when the Lord's festival comes - 
28Hs 9:6 Look! They have gone away because of the destruction?Egypt will gather them up, and Memphis will bury them. Weeds will overgrow their inheritance, and thorns will grow in their tents.
28Hs 9:7 The time for your judgment has now come; payday is here?and Israel knows it. The prophet is a fool, and the spiritual man is insane. Because of your great sin, the hatred against you is great.
28Hs 9:8 While Ephraim stands watch with my God, the prophet has snares set that will trap his ways, and hostility lodges in the temple of his God.
28Hs 9:9 They have corrupted themselves deeply, as did Gibeah in its day. Therefore God will remember their lawlessness, and he will pay them back for their sins.
28Hs 9:10 "I found Israel, as one finds grapes in the wilderness; Your ancestors seemed to me like the fruit gleaned from a fig tree's first harvest. When they went to Baal-peor, they devoted themselves to that filth, and they became loathsome, like what they loved.
28Hs 9:11 The glory of Ephraim will fly away like a bird?no birth, no pregnancy, not even a conception.
28Hs 9:12 Even if they rear their children, I will, in turn, make them childless?in fact, woe to them when I turn away from them!
28Hs 9:13 Ephraim, as I see it, is like Tyre, planted in a comfortable place; but Ephraim will bear children but they will be executed."
28Hs 9:14 Give them, Lord?What will you give?You will give them a womb that miscarries and dry breasts.
28Hs 9:15 "All of their wickedness started in Gilgal, because I began to hate them there. Because of the wickedness of their behavior, I will drive them from my temple. I will not love them any more; all their leaders are rebels.
28Hs 9:16 Ephraim is blighted; its roots shriveled. It can bear no fruit. Even if they bear children, I will kill their cherished offspring.
28Hs 9:17 "My God will reject them, because they did not obey him, and they will become wanderers among the nations."
28Hs 10:1 "Israel, the overgrown vine, bears fruit like itself; the more fruitful they become, the more altars they build. The better the land, the more ornate the stone idols.
28Hs 10:2 Their hearts are divided; from now on they are to be found guilty. God will tear down their altars, he will destroy their stone idols.
28Hs 10:3 From now on they will say, 'We have no king, because we did not fear the Lord?and what would a king do for us?
28Hs 10:4 Their word is falsely given as they make their agreements; so judgment springs up like poisonous weeds in the furrows of a field.
28Hs 10:5 "The residents of Samaria will be terrified because of the cows of Beth-aven. Its people will mourn over Beth-aven, along with the priests who will mourn its glory, because that glory has departed.
28Hs 10:6 Indeed, that glory will be carried to Assyria?it will become a present for an avenging king. Ephraim will be disgraced, and Israel will become ashamed of its decision.
28Hs 10:7 Samaria's king will float away like driftwood on the surface of water.
28Hs 10:8 Destroyed will be the high places of Aven, that are the sin of Israel. Both thorn and thistle will grow up over their altars. They will call out to the mountains, 'Cover us!' and to the hills, 'Fall on us!'
28Hs 10:9 "From the time of Gibeah, you have sinned, Israel; There they took their stand; the battle at Gibeah could not subdue the lawless.
28Hs 10:10 When I'm ready, I will chasten them; and the peoples will gather against them, to imprison them for their two unrighteous acts."
28Hs 10:11 "Ephraim, the well-trained heifer, loves to thresh grain, so I will spare her neck. I will turn Ephraim into a pack animal. Judah will pull the plow, and Jacob will turn up the fallow ground.
28Hs 10:12 Sow in righteousness in your own interest, reap in gracious love, break up your own unprepared ground; It is now time to inquire of the Lord, until he comes to pour out righteousness for you.
28Hs 10:13 You have plowed evil; you have reaped unrighteousness; you have eaten the fruit of hypocrisy; because you trusted in your own direction, and in the number of your mighty forces.
28Hs 10:14 Therefore a disaster will come upon your people, and all of your fortresses will be ruined. As Shalman destroyed Beth-arbel in wartime, mothers were dashed to pieces along with their children.
28Hs 10:15 The same will happen to you, Bethel, because of your great evil?early one morning the king of Israel will be totally silenced."
28Hs 11:1 "When Israel was a young child I loved him, and from Egypt I called my son.
28Hs 11:2 The more I called out to them, the farther they fled from me; they sacrificed to Baals, burning incense to carved images.
28Hs 11:3 Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk, supporting them by their arms, but they never knew that I was healing them.
28Hs 11:4 I guided them with human kindness, with loving reins. I acted toward them like one who removes a yoke from their neck; I bent down and fed them.
28Hs 11:5 "They will not return to the land of Egypt; instead, the Assyrian will be their king, because they kept refusing to repent.
28Hs 11:6 The sword will fall on their cities, consuming and devouring their fortified gates, despite their planning.
28Hs 11:7 My people are determined to turn away from me; though they call to the Most High, no one is worshiping.
28Hs 11:8 "How can I give up on you, Ephraim?I will deliver you, will I not, Israel?How can I treat you like Admah?I can't make you like Zeboim, can I?My heart stirs within me; my compassion also fans into flame!
28Hs 11:9 I will not act in my anger; I will not return to destroy Ephraim, For I am God, and not a human?the Holy One among you?so I will not enter the city in anger.
28Hs 11:10 They will go after the Lord, who will roar like a lion; and when he roars, the children will come trembling from the west.
28Hs 11:11 Trembling like a bird, they will come out of Egypt, and as a dove from the land of Assyria; and I will settle them in their houses," declares the Lord.
28Hs 11:12 "Ephraim surrounds me with lies, and the house of Israel surrounds me with deceit, But Judah still rules with God, and remains faithful, along with the godly ones."
28Hs 12:1 "Ephraim feeds on the wind, chasing after the eastern winds, storing up lies and desolation day after day. They are making a contract with the Assyrians, and sending oil to Egypt.
28Hs 12:2 The Lord accuses Judah, and will punish Jacob according to his ways; he will repay him for what he does. 
28Hs 12:3 He circumvented his brother in the womb, and as an adult he fought with God.
28Hs 12:4 He even fought the angel and won; he cried and prayed to him. Then at Bethel he found him, and there he spoke with us - 
28Hs 12:5 the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies?the Lord is his name.
28Hs 12:6 So you, return to your God; guard grace and justice, and look to your God always.
28Hs 12:7 "Now as for the merchant, deceitful balances remain in his hand, and he loves to defraud.
28Hs 12:8 Ephraim claims, 'I have become rich, I have made a fortune! Because of all my wealth, no one will find any iniquity or sin in me.'
28Hs 12:9 "Yet I remain the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt. I will make you live in tents again, as in the festival of that name.
28Hs 12:10 I spoke to the prophets, giving revelation after revelation, and employing parables in the prophetic writings.
28Hs 12:11 "There's iniquity in Gilead, isn't there?They have become truly vain. They sacrifice bulls in Gilgal; their altars are like piles of stone in furrowed fields.
28Hs 12:12 Jacob fled into the land of Aram; Israel served there to obtain his wife, tending sheep to gain his wife.
28Hs 12:13 "By a prophet the Lord brought Israel out of Egypt, and by a prophet he was rescued.
28Hs 12:14 Ephraim has stirred up violent anger; therefore the guilt of his blood will remain on him, and his Lord will repay him for his contempt."
28Hs 13:1 "When the tribe of Ephraim spoke, there was trembling; and it was exalted within Israel. But when they offended God by Baal, they died,
28Hs 13:2 but now they are sinning more and more, crafting idols from melted silver. Their idols are made with the most exacting skill, all of it the work of craftsmen. People say about them, 'They offer human sacrifice, and kiss calf-shaped idols.'
28Hs 13:3 Therefore they will be like morning clouds, like early morning dew that evaporates, like chaff blown away from the threshing floor, or like smoke from a chimney."
28Hs 13:4 "I am the Lord your God from the land of Egypt, and you have known no god except for me, because except for me there is no savior.
28Hs 13:5 I took care of you in the wilderness, in a waterless land.
28Hs 13:6 As their pastures flourished, all their desires were met. As they were satiated, they became arrogant and therefore ignored me.
28Hs 13:7 "So I will be like a lion to them. Like a leopard I will stalk them along the road.
28Hs 13:8 I will confront them like a bear deprived of her cubs; I will tear open their ribs. I will devour them like a lion?the wild beasts will rip them apart.
28Hs 13:9 "You have destroyed yourself, Israel, although I remain your help.
28Hs 13:10 Now where is your king?Will he save you in all your cities?And where are your judges, about whom you demanded, 'Give me a king and officials!' - 
28Hs 13:11 I gave you a king in my anger, and I took him away in my fury."
28Hs 13:12 "Ephraim's guilt is on record; his sin is stored away.
28Hs 13:13 When the time of childbirth comes, he will be so foolish that he will refuse to be born."
28Hs 13:14 "From the power of Sheol I will rescue them, from death I will redeem them. Death, where are your plagues?Sheol, where is your destruction?My eyes will remain closed to your pleas for compassion.
28Hs 13:15 Even though he is fruitful compared to his relatives, an east wind will come, the Lord's wind storm from the wilderness, and his spring will evaporate. His fountain will dry up, and the Lord's wind storm will plunder all the expensive vessels of the treasury.
28Hs 13:16 Samaria will be held guilty, because she has rebelled against her God. By the sword they will fall?with their infants dashed to pieces, and their pregnant women torn open."
28Hs 14:1 "Return, Israel, to the Lord your God, for you have fallen due to your own iniquity.
28Hs 14:2 Bring a prepared speech with you as you return to the Lord. Say to him£º 'Take away all our iniquity, and accept what is good. Then we will present the fruit of our lips.
28Hs 14:3 Assyria won't save us; we won't be riding on horses, Nor will we be saying anymore to the work of our hands, "You are our God." Indeed, in you the orphan finds mercy.'
28Hs 14:4 "I will correct their apostasy, loving them freely, since my anger will have turned away from them.
28Hs 14:5 I will be like the dew to Israel; Israel will blossom like a lily, growing roots like the cedars of Lebanon.
28Hs 14:6 Israel's branches will spread out, and its beauty will be like an olive tree, with its scent like that of Lebanon.
28Hs 14:7 Those who live under its protection will surely return. Their grain will flourish; they will blossom like a vine, and Israel's scent will be like wine from Lebanon.
28Hs 14:8 "Ephraim, what have I in common with idols?I have listened and will pay attention to him. I am like a flourishing cypress; in me will your fruit be found."
28Hs 14:9 Whoever is wise, let him understand these things. Whoever is discerning, let him know them. For the ways of the Lord are right£º the righteous follow his example, but the rebellious stumble in them.

29Jl 1:1 The word of the Lord that came to Pethuel's son Joel.
29Jl 1:2 "Hear this, you elders! Listen, all of you residents of the land! Has there ever been anything like this during your lifetime, or even when your ancestors were alive - 
29Jl 1:3 Pass it on to your children, and from your children to their children, and from their children to the following generation.
29Jl 1:4 Whatever the devouring locust left behind the locust swarm has consumed! Whatever the locust swarm has left behind, the young locust has consumed! Whatever the young locust has left behind, the ravaging locust has consumed!"
29Jl 1:5 "Wake up, you drunkards! Cry aloud and howl, you wine drinkers, because your supply of new wine has been snatched from you.
29Jl 1:6 Indeed, a nation has invaded my land?it is strong and its population is too large to count?with teeth like a lion and fangs like a lioness.
29Jl 1:7 That nation laid waste my vines, and stripped bare my fig tree, discarding it. It stripped off its bark.
29Jl 1:8 "Grieve like a virgin, who, dressed in her mourner's clothes, cries out in memory of the man she was going to marry.
29Jl 1:9 Both grain offering and wine offering have been removed from the Lord's temple; the priests and ministering servants of the Lord are mourning."
29Jl 1:10 "The fields lie in ruins and the ground is dried up. Indeed, the grain is ruined, the new wine has evaporated, and the olive oil has run out.
29Jl 1:11 Be dismayed, you farmers! Cry aloud, you vintners, for the wheat and barley, because the harvest in your fields has been lost.
29Jl 1:12 The grapevine is shriveled and the fig tree is withered, along with the pomegranate tree, the palm tree, the apple tree and all of the cultivated trees. Truly, joy has evaporated from Adam's children."
29Jl 1:13 "Put on your mourning clothes, you priests; and cry aloud, you ministering servants at the altar! Come! Stay the night in mourner's clothes, you ministers of my God, because the grain offering and the wine offering is held back from the temple of your God.
29Jl 1:14 Set apart time for a fast! Call a solemn assembly! Gather the elders and everyone living in the land to the temple of the Lord your God, and cry out to the Lord!"
29Jl 1:15 Oh, no! For the Day of the Lord approaches, and like destruction from the Almighty, it will come!
29Jl 1:16 Isn't our food supply cut off right in front of us, along with joy and gladness from the temple of our God - 
29Jl 1:17 Seeds shrivel within their furrows, the storehouses lie empty, and granaries stand in ruins because the grain has withered.
29Jl 1:18 Oh, how the livestock groan! The herds of cattle wander about because they have no pasture. Even flocks of sheep suffer!
29Jl 1:19 To you, Lord, I cry out, because fire has devoured the open pastures, and has set all the cultivated trees ablaze.
29Jl 1:20 The livestock also cries out to you, because their water sources have evaporated and because fire has consumed the open pastures.
29Jl 2:1 "Sound the ram's horn in Zion! Sound an alarm on my holy mountain! Tremble, all of you inhabitants of the land, because the Day of the Lord is coming. Oh, how near it is!
29Jl 2:2 A day of doom and gloom, a day of clouds and shadows like the dawn spreads out to cover the mountains?a people strong and robust. Never has there been anything like it, neither will anything follow to compare with it, even through the lifetime of generation upon generation."
29Jl 2:3 "A fire blazes in their presence, and behind them a conflagration rages. Before they come, the land is like the garden in Eden; after they leave, there is only a barren wasteland. Indeed, nothing escapes them.
29Jl 2:4 As to their form, they're like horses; and like chariot horses, how they can run!
29Jl 2:5 They leap like the rumbling of chariots echoing from mountain tops, like the roar of wild fire that devours the chaff, as an army firmly established in battle array.
29Jl 2:6 The people are terrified in their presence; every face grows pale.
29Jl 2:7 They run like elite soldiers, climbing ramparts like men trained for war. Each man advances in proper order, never breaking rank.
29Jl 2:8 Neither does a man crowd his fellow soldier; each one marches in his own path. When they fall by the sword they are not injured.
29Jl 2:9 They swarm through the city, running upon its ramparts. Climbing atop the houses, they enter through windows like a thief."
29Jl 2:10 "The land quivers in their presence; even the heavens shake. The sun and moon will grow dark, and the stars will stop shining.
29Jl 2:11 The Lord will shout in the presence of his forces, because his encampment is very great; for powerful is he who carries out his word. Truly the Day of the Lord is great, and very terrifying. Who will be able to survive it?
29Jl 2:12 "Yet even now," declares the Lord, "Turn back to me with your whole heart, with fasting, tears, and mourning.
29Jl 2:13 Tear your hearts, not your garments; and turn back to the Lord your God. For he is gracious and compassionate, slow to become angry, overflowing in gracious love, and grieves about this evil.
29Jl 2:14 Who knows?He will turn back and relent, will he not, leaving behind a blessing, even a grain offering and drink offering for the Lord your God?
29Jl 2:15 "Sound the ram's horn in Zion! Dedicate a fast and call for a solemn assembly!
29Jl 2:16 Gather the people! Dedicate the congregation! Bring in the elders. Gather the youngsters and even the nursing infants. Call the bridegroom from his wedding preparations, and the bride from her dressing room.
29Jl 2:17 As they serve between the porch and the altar, let the priests and ministers of the Lord weep and pray£º 'Spare your people, Lord, and do not make your heritage a disgrace so that nations ridicule them. Why should they say among the people, "Where is their God?'"
29Jl 2:18 Then the Lord will show great concern for his land, and will have compassion on his people.
29Jl 2:19 The Lord will say to his people, "Look! I will send you grain, new wine, and oil, and you will be content with them. I will no longer cause you to be a disgrace among the nations."
29Jl 2:20 "I will remove the northerners from you, driving them to a barren and desolate land?the front toward the Dead Sea and the back toward the Mediterranean. Their stench will rise, and their stinking odor will ascend, because they have done great things."
29Jl 2:21 "Stop being afraid, land! Rejoice and be glad, because the Lord will do great things.
29Jl 2:22 Stop being afraid, beasts of the field, because the desert pastures will bloom, the trees will bear their fruit, and the fig tree and vine will deliver their wealth.
29Jl 2:23 And so be glad, children of Zion, and rejoice in the Lord your God, because he has given you the right amount of early rain, and he will cause the rain to fall for you, both the early rain and the later rain as before.
29Jl 2:24 The threshing floors will be smothered in grain, and the vats will overflow with wine and oil.
29Jl 2:25 "Then I will restore to you the years that the locust swarm devoured, as did the young locust, the other locusts, and the ravaging locust, that great army of mine that I sent among you.
29Jl 2:26 You will have plenty to eat, and will be fully satisfied. You will praise the name of the Lord your God, who has performed wonders specifically for you. And my people will never be ashamed.
29Jl 2:27 As a result, you will know that I am in the midst of Israel; that I myself am the Lord your God?and there is none other! And my people will never be ashamed."
29Jl 2:28 "Then it will come about at a later time that I will pour out my Spirit on every person. Your sons and your daughters will prophesy. Your elderly people will dream dreams, and your young people will see visions.
29Jl 2:29 Also at that time I will pour out my Spirit upon men and women servants.
29Jl 2:30 I will display warnings in the heavens, and on the earth blood, fire, and columns of smoke.
29Jl 2:31 The sun will be given over to darkness, and the moon to blood, before the coming of the great and terrifying Day of the Lord.
29Jl 2:32 And everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord will be delivered. For as the Lord has said, 'In Mount Zion and in Jerusalem there will be those who escape, the survivors whom the Lord is calling.'"
29Jl 3:1 "Look, now! In those very days and at that time, when I restore prosperity to Judah and Jerusalem,
29Jl 3:2 I will gather all nations, bringing them down to the Valley of Jehoshaphat. I will set out my case against them there, on behalf of my people, my heritage Israel, whom they scattered among the nations, apportioning my land among themselves.
29Jl 3:3 They cast lots for my people?they sold a young boy in exchange for a prostitute, and a girl for wine, so they could drink.
29Jl 3:4 Furthermore, what have you to do with me, Tyre, Sidon, and all the sea coasts of Philistia?Are you taking revenge on me?If you are taking revenge on me, I'll send it back on you swiftly and promptly,
29Jl 3:5 since you took my silver and gold, carried my precious treasures into your temples,
29Jl 3:6 and sold Judah's and Jerusalem's descendants to the Greeks, so you can remove them far from their homeland!
29Jl 3:7 Look, I will bring them up from where you sold them, I will turn your revenge back upon you,
29Jl 3:8 and I will sell your sons and daughters into the control of the people of Judah. And they will sell them to the people of Sheba, a country far away." Indeed, the Lord has spoken.
29Jl 3:9 "Declare this among the nations£º 'Prepare for war! Wake up your elite forces! Let all the soldiers draw near! Call them up!
29Jl 3:10 Beat your plow blades into swords, and your pruning knives into spears! Let the frail say, "I am strong!"
29Jl 3:11 Hurry and come, all you gentiles! Gather yourselves together!'" Lord, cause your mighty army to come down.
29Jl 3:12 "Let the nations be awakened and come to the Valley of Jehoshaphat; because I will sit to judge all the surrounding nations.
29Jl 3:13 Put in the sickle, because the harvest is ripe. Come and go down, because the winepress is full. The wine vats are overflowing, because their evil is great!
29Jl 3:14 Multitudes, multitudes in the Valley of Judgment! For the Day of the Lord is near in the Valley of Judgment!
29Jl 3:15 The sun and moon will grow dark, and the stars will stop shining.
29Jl 3:16 The Lord will roar from Zion, and shout from Jerusalem. The heavens and the earth will shake, but the Lord will be the refuge of his people, and the strength of the people of Israel."
29Jl 3:17 "And truly you will know that I am the Lord your God, dwelling in Zion, my holy mountain. Then Jerusalem will be holy, and no foreigners will invade her again.
29Jl 3:18 It will come about at that time that the mountains will drip with newly pressed wine, the hills will flow with milk, and the streams of Judah will flow abundantly. A fountain will spring from the temple of the Lord, to water the Valley of the Acacias.
29Jl 3:19 Egypt will be desolate, and Edom will be a desert, because of violence against the people of Judah since they shed innocent blood in their land.
29Jl 3:20 But Judah will live forever, and Jerusalem from generation to generation.
29Jl 3:21 I will acquit their bloodguilt that has not yet been acquitted. For the Lord lives in Zion!

30Am 1:1 The words of Amos, who was among the sheep breeders of Tekoa, which he spoke concerning Israel during the reign of Uzziah, king of Judah and during the reign of Joash's son Jeroboam, king of Israel, two years before the earthquake.
30Am 1:2 He said, "From Zion the Lord roars, and from Jerusalem he shouts aloud. The shepherds' pastures will languish, and Carmel's summit will wither.
30Am 1:3 This is what the Lord says£º "For three transgressions of Damascus?and now for a fourth?I will not turn away; because they have trampled down Gilead with ironclad threshing sleds.
30Am 1:4 So I will send down fire upon the house of Hazael, and it will devour the palaces of Ben-hadad.
30Am 1:5 I will shatter the gate bars of Damascus, and I will cut off the residents of the Aven Valley, along with the one who holds the scepter from Beth-eden; and the people of Aram will be exiled to Kir," says the Lord.
30Am 1:6 This is what the Lord says£º "For three transgressions of Gaza?and now for a fourth?I will not turn away; because they exiled the entire population, delivering them to Edom.
30Am 1:7 So I will send down fire upon the wall of Gaza, and it will devour their fortified citadels;
30Am 1:8 and I will cut off the inhabitants of Ashdod, along with Ashkelon's ruler. I will turn to attack Ekron, and the rest of the Philistines will die," says the Lord God.
30Am 1:9 This is what the Lord says£º "For three transgressions of Tyre?and now for a fourth?I will not turn away; because they delivered the entire population to Edom, and did not remember their covenant with their relatives.
30Am 1:10 So I will send down fire upon the wall of Tyre, and it will devour their fortified citadels."
30Am 1:11 This is what the Lord says£º "For three transgressions of Edom?and now for a fourth?I will not turn away; because he pursued his brother with a sword, refusing to be compassionate. His anger was raging continuously; he kept up his unending wrath.
30Am 1:12 So I will send down fire upon Teman, and it will devour the fortified citadels of Bozrah."
30Am 1:13 This is what the Lord says£º "For three transgressions of the Ammonites?and now for a fourth?I will not turn away; because they ripped open the pregnant women of Gilead in order to enlarge their national borders.
30Am 1:14 So I will send down fire upon the wall of Rabbah, and it will devour their fortified citadels with an alarm sounding in the time of battle, and with a whirlwind in the time of storm.
30Am 1:15 Their king will go into captivity?he and his princes together," says the Lord.
30Am 2:1 This is what the Lord says£º "For three transgressions of Moab because they cremated the bones of the king of Edom, burning them to lime.
30Am 2:2 So I will send down fire upon Moab, and it will devour the fortified citadels of Kerioth. Moab will die in the uproar of battle, with a war cry and with the trumpeting of the ram's horn.
30Am 2:3 I will execute their rulers among them, killing all of their officials as well," says the Lord.
30Am 2:4 This is what the Lord says£º "For three transgressions of Judah?and now for a fourth?I will not turn away; because they rejected the law of the Lord and did not keep his statutes. Their own lies made them wander off, following along the same path their ancestors walked.
30Am 2:5 So I will send down fire upon Judah, and it will devour the fortified citadels of Jerusalem."
30Am 2:6 This is what the Lord says£º "For three transgressions of Israel?and now for a fourth?I will not turn away; because they sold the righteous for money, and the poor for sandals,
30Am 2:7 moving quickly to rub the face of the needy in the dirt. Corrupting the ways of the humble, a man and his father go to the same woman, deliberately defiling my holy name.
30Am 2:8 They lay down beside every altar, on garments pledged as collateral, drinking wine paid for through fines imposed by the temple of their gods.
30Am 2:9 Yet it was I who destroyed the Amorites in front of them, though their height seemed like a cedar, though their strength seemed like an oak, but whose fruit I destroyed from above and the roots from beneath.
30Am 2:10 Furthermore, I brought you up from the land of Egypt, leading you in the wilderness for 40 years, to take possession of the land of the Amorites.
30Am 2:11 I also raised up your sons to be prophets, and from your young men I raised up Nazarites. Is this not true, people of Israel? declares the Lord.
30Am 2:12 "But you forced the Nazarites to drink wine, and commanded the prophets, 'You are not to prophesy!'"
30Am 2:13 "Oh, how I am burdened down with you, as a wagon is overloaded with harvested grain!
30Am 2:14 So the swift runner will not escape, the valiant will not fortify his strength, and the mighty warrior will not save his life.
30Am 2:15 The skilled archer will not be able to stand, the swift runner will not survive, and the mounted rider will not preserve his own life.
30Am 2:16 Even the bravest of elite troops will run away naked at that time," declares the Lord.
30Am 3:1 "Listen to this message that the Lord has spoken about you, people of Israel. It concerns the entire family that I brought from the land of Egypt£º 
30Am 3:2 "You alone have I known from among all of the families of mankind; therefore I will hold you accountable for all your iniquities."
30Am 3:3 "Will a couple walk in unity without having met - 
30Am 3:4 Will a lion roar in the forest without having found its prey?Will a young lion cry from its den without having caught anything - 
30Am 3:5 Does a bird fall into a snare on the ground without any bait in the trap?Will a trap snap shut when there is nothing to catch - 
30Am 3:6 And when an alarm sounds in the city, the people will tremble, won't they?If there is trouble in a city, the Lord has brought it about, has he not?
30Am 3:7 "Truly the Lord God will do nothing he has mentioned without revealing his purposes to his servants the prophets.
30Am 3:8 A lion has roared! Who will not fear?The Lord God has spoken! Who will not prophesy - 
30Am 3:9 Announce this in the fortified citadels of Ashdod, and in the fortified citadels of the land of Egypt. Tell them, 'Gather together on the mountains of Samaria; look at the great misery among the citadels, along with the oppression within Egypt.'
30Am 3:10 Because they do not know how to act right," declares the Lord, "they are filling their strongholds with treasures that they took from others by violence into their fortified citadels."
30Am 3:11 Therefore this is what the Lord God says£º "An enemy will surround the land. He will pull down your defenses, and plunder your fortified citadels."
30Am 3:12 This is what the Lord says£º "Just as a shepherd might save from the lion's mouth only two leg bones or a scrap of an ear, the Israelites will be saved in a similar manner?those in Samaria who sit on the remains of their broken beds, and those in Damascus who lie on the edge of their couches."
30Am 3:13 "Listen and testify against the house of Jacob," declares the Lord God, the God of the Heavenly Armies,
30Am 3:14 "because on that day I will lay out the charges against Israel. I will also bring judgment upon the altars of Bethel; the horns of the altar will be cut off and will fall to the ground.
30Am 3:15 I will wreck both the winter house and the summer house, and the ivory houses will fall. These palaces will surely fall," declares the Lord.
30Am 4:1 "Listen to this message, you fat cows from Bashan, who live on the Samaritan mountains, who oppress the poor, who rob the needy, and who constantly ask your husbands for one more drink!"
30Am 4:2 The Lord God has taken a sacred oath£º "The day is coming when they will take you away on fishhooks, every last one of you on fishhooks.
30Am 4:3 Each of you will go out through the breaches of the walls straight to Mt. Hermon," declares the Lord.
30Am 4:4 "Come to Bethel and sin, to Gilgal and sin even more! Bring along your morning sacrifices, and pay your tithes every other day.
30Am 4:5 While you're at it, present a thank offering with leaven, and publicize your freewill offerings, letting everyone hear about it, because this is what you really love to do, you Israelites," declares the Lord God.
30Am 4:6 "I also have scheduled food shortages for you in all of your cities, and lack of bread in all of your settlements, but you haven't returned to me," declares the Lord.
30Am 4:7 "I therefore have withheld the rain from you three months before the harvest, causing rain to come upon one city, but not upon another, and upon one field but not upon another, so that it would wither.
30Am 4:8 So the people of two or three cities staggered away to another city in order to obtain drinking water, but you have not returned to me," declares the Lord.
30Am 4:9 "I afflicted you with blight and fungus; and the locust swarm devoured the harvest of your gardens, your vineyards, your fig trees, and your olive trees, but you have not returned to me," declares the Lord.
30Am 4:10 "I sent plagues among you as I did with Egypt. I killed your choicest young men with the sword. I took your horses away from you. I filled your noses with the stench of your encampments, but you have not returned to me," declares the Lord.
30Am 4:11 "I overthrew your cities, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. You've become like a burning ember, snatched from the fire, but you have not returned to me," declares the Lord.
30Am 4:12 "Therefore this is what I will do to you, Israel. Because I am about to do this, prepare to be summoned to your God, Israel!"
30Am 4:13 "Look! The one who crafts mountains, who creates the wind, who reveals what he is thinking to mankind, who darkens the morning light, who tramples down the high places of the land?the Lord, the God of the Heavenly Armies is his name."
30Am 5:1 "Hear this accusation that I am bringing against you£º "A dirge, house of Israel£º 
30Am 5:2 Fallen is Israel the virgin - never to rise again! She is abandoned on her own land, with no one to raise her up.
30Am 5:3 "For this is what the Lord God says£º 'The city that is sending out a thousand will have a hundred left; The city that is sending out a hundred will have ten left of the house of Israel.'"
30Am 5:4 "For this is what the Lord says to the house of Israel£º 'Seek me and live,
30Am 5:5 but don't seek Bethel. Don't go to Gilgal, and don't pass over to Beersheba. Because Gilgal will surely go into captivity, and Bethel will come to nothing.
30Am 5:6 Seek the Lord and live! Otherwise, he may break out like a fire in the house of Joseph and devour Bethel, and there will be no one to extinguish it.
30Am 5:7 Those of you who are making justice taste bitter, and who have thrown righteousness to the ground£º 
30Am 5:8 Seek the one who fashions the Pleiades and Orion, who turns the deep darkness into morning, who darkens day into night, who calls out to the waters of the sea, pouring them out onto the surface of the earth?the Lord is his name.
30Am 5:9 It is he who is raining sudden destruction upon the strong like lightning, so that ruin comes upon the fortress.
30Am 5:10 They have hated those who are presenting their cases in court, detesting the one who speaks truthfully.
30Am 5:11 "Therefore, since you continually trample the poor, taxing his grain, building houses of stone in which you won't live and planting fine vineyards from which you won't drink - 
30Am 5:12 and because I know that your transgressions are many, and your sins are numerous as you oppose the righteous, taking bribes as a ransom, and turning away the poor in court - 
30Am 5:13 therefore the prudent person remains silent at such a time, for the time is evil.
30Am 5:14 "Pursue good and not evil, so that you may live, and the Lord, the God of the Heavenly Armies, will be with you, as you have been claiming.
30Am 5:15 Hate evil and love good, and establish justice in court?perhaps the Lord, the God of the Heavenly Armies, will be gracious to the survivors of Joseph."
30Am 5:16 Therefore this is what the Lord, the God of the Heavenly Armies, the Lord, says£º "There will be dirges in all of the streets; and in all of the highways they will cry out in anguish. They will call the farmer to mourning and those who lament to grieve.
30Am 5:17 And in all of the vineyards there will be mourning when I pass through your midst," says the Lord.
30Am 5:18 "Woe to those who are craving the Day of the Lord! How is it to your benefit, this Day of the Lord?It's a day of darkness to you, and not light.
30Am 5:19 It will be like a man who runs from a lion, only to encounter a bear; or who comes home, leans his hand against a wall, and a serpent bites him!
30Am 5:20 Will not the Day of the Lord be darkness, and not light?pitch black at that, without a ray of sunshine?
30Am 5:21 "I hate?I despise?your feast days, and your solemn convocations stink.
30Am 5:22 And if you send up burnt offerings to me as well as your grain offerings, I will not accept them, nor will I consider your peace offerings of fattened cattle.
30Am 5:23 Spare me your noisy singing?I will not listen to your musical instruments.
30Am 5:24 "But let justice roll on like many waters, and righteousness like an ever-flowing river.
30Am 5:25 "Was it to me that you brought offerings and gifts in the desert for 40 years, house of Israel - 
30Am 5:26 And you carried the tabernacle of your king?and Saturn, your star god idols that you crafted for yourselves.
30Am 5:27 So I will cause you to be taken captive beyond Damascus," says the Lord, whose name is God of the Heavenly Armies.
30Am 6:1 "Woe to those who are at ease in Zion, to those who rest on the mountain of Samaria?the famous men of the nations to whom the house of Israel came!
30Am 6:2 Cross over to Calneh and look around, then go on to that great city of Hamath, and from there go down to Gath of the Philistines. Are you better than these kingdoms?Or is their territory more extensive than yours - 
30Am 6:3 "Disbelieving that a day of evil will come, embracing opportunities to commit violence,
30Am 6:4 lying on ivory beds, stretching out on your couches, eating lambs from the flock, and fattened calves from the stall,
30Am 6:5 chanting to the sound of stringed instruments as if they were David, composing songs to themselves as if they were musicians,
30Am 6:6 drinking wine from bowls, anointing themselves with the choicest of oils, but not grieving on the occasion of Joseph's ruin - 
30Am 6:7 therefore you will be the first to go into exile, and the celebrations of those who are lounging will end."
30Am 6:8 "The Lord God has sworn by himself," declares the Lord, the God of the Heavenly Armies, "I utterly detest the arrogance of Jacob; I hate his fortresses; and I will deliver up the city, along with everyone in it.
30Am 6:9 "And if there are ten men remaining in one house, they will die.
30Am 6:10 One's relative will pick up the corpse to carry them from the house for burning, saying to whomever remains inside the house, 'Is there anyone still with you? And he will say, 'No.' He will respond, 'Be quiet, because we do not mention the name "Lord".'
30Am 6:11 For indeed, the Lord is giving the command?and he will smash the large house to rubble and the small house into bits.
30Am 6:12 "Horses don't run over bare rock, do they?One doesn't plow rock with oxen, does he?But you have turned justice to gall, and the fruit of righteousness into bitterness.
30Am 6:13 You rejoice in nothing worth mentioning?that is, you keep on saying, 'We captured Karnaim by our own strength of will and by our own effort, didn't we?
30Am 6:14 "So look, house of Israel! I will raise up a nation against you," declares the Lord, the God of the Heavenly Armies, "and they will harass you from the entrance of Hamath to the wadi of the wilderness."
30Am 7:1 This is what the Lord God showed me£º Look, he was forming locust swarms as the latter plantings were just beginning to sprout. Indeed, the king had just taken his first fruit tax.
30Am 7:2 And so it came about that when the swarm had finished eating the grass of the land, I was saying, "Lord God, forgive - please! How will Jacob stand, since he is small?
30Am 7:3 So the Lord relented from this. "This will not happen," said the Lord.
30Am 7:4 This is what the Lord God showed me£º Look, the Lord God was calling for judgment by fire, and it was drying up the great depths of the ocean and consuming the land.
30Am 7:5 So I kept on saying, "Lord God, forgive?please! How will Jacob stand, since he is so small?
30Am 7:6 So the Lord relented from this. "This will not happen, either," said the Lord God.
30Am 7:7 This is what he showed me£º Look, the Lord was standing upon a wall that stood straight and true, with a plumb line in his hand.
30Am 7:8 And the Lord was asking me, "What do you see, Amos? I replied, "A plumb line." So the Lord said, "Look, I have set a plumb line in the midst of my people Israel. I will no longer spare them.
30Am 7:9 Isaac's high places will be destroyed, and the sanctuaries of Israel will be ruined. I will rise in opposition to the house of Jeroboam with my sword."
30Am 7:10 So Amaziah priest of Bethel sent a message to Jeroboam king of Israel. It said, "Amos has been conspiring against you in the very heart of the house of Israel! The land cannot bear everything he has to say,
30Am 7:11 because Amos is saying this£º 'By the sword shall Jeroboam die, and Israel shall surely go into exile far from her homeland.'"
30Am 7:12 So Amaziah kept saying to Amos, "Get out of here, you seer! Go back to the land of Judah. Live there and prophesy there.
30Am 7:13 Don't prophesy anymore at Bethel, because it's the king's sanctuary and a temple of the kingdom."
30Am 7:14 Amos replied in answer to Amaziah, "I am no prophet, nor am I a prophet's son, for I have been shepherding and picking the fruit of sycamore trees.
30Am 7:15 But the Lord took me from tending the flock and the Lord kept saying to me, 'Go, prophesy to my people Israel.'
30Am 7:16 "Very well then, hear the word of the Lord£º 'You are saying, "Don't prophesy against Israel, and don't preach against the house of Isaac."
30Am 7:17 'Therefore this is what the Lord says£º "Your wife will become a whore in the city, and your sons and daughters will die by the sword. Your land will be divided and apportioned, and you will die in a foreign land. Israel will surely go into exile, far from its homeland."'"
30Am 8:1 This is what the Lord God showed me£º Look! A basket of summer fruit!
30Am 8:2 And he was asking, "What do you see, Amos? I answered, "A basket of summer fruit." Then the Lord said to me, "The end approaches for my people Israel. I will no longer spare them.
30Am 8:3 At that time," declares the Lord God, "the temple songs will be wailing. Many bodies will accumulate everywhere.
30Am 8:4 "Hear this, you who are swallowing up the needy, who intend to make the poor of the land fail,
30Am 8:5 and who are saying, 'When will the new moon fade so we may sell grain, and the Sabbath conclude so we may market winnowed wheat? shortchanging the measure, raising the price, falsifying the scales by treachery,
30Am 8:6 buying the poor for cash, and the needy for a pair of sandals, selling chaff mixed in with the wheat."
30Am 8:7 "The Lord has sworn by the pride of Jacob£º I will never forget anything they have done.
30Am 8:8 Surely the land will tremble because of this, won't it?And all who live in it will mourn, won't they?The entire land will swell up like a flooded river. It will be stirred up and then will sink like the river of Egypt.
30Am 8:9 It will come about at that time," declares the Lord God, "I will cause the sun to set at noon and the earth to darken in the daylight.
30Am 8:10 I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all of your songs to dirges. I will cause all of you to put on sackcloth and to shave all of your heads. I will make that time like mourning for an only son, and its conclusion will be like the end of a bitter day."
30Am 8:11 "Look! The days are coming," declares the Lord God, "when I will send a famine throughout the land?not a famine of food or a thirst for water?but rather a famine of hearing the words of the Lord.
30Am 8:12 People will stagger from sea to sea, from north to east. They will run back and forth, searching for the word of the Lord, but they won't find it.
30Am 8:13 At that time, the beautiful virgins will faint, as will the strong young men - from thirst.
30Am 8:14 Those who have been swearing oaths by the sin of Samaria, or who say, 'As your god lives, Dan¡¦' or who say "As the way of Beersheba lives¡¦'?will fall, and will never rise again."
30Am 9:1 I saw the Lord standing beside the altar as he was saying, "Strike the doorposts so that the thresholds tremble, bringing them down on the heads of all of them. Those who survive I will kill with the sword. Those who flee will not escape. There will be no deliverance for the fugitives.
30Am 9:2 "Even if they burrow into Sheol, from there my hand will find them. Even if they ascend to the heavens, from there I will bring them down.
30Am 9:3 Even if they hide at the top of Mount Carmel, from there I will search and seize them. Even if they hide from my sight in the depths of the sea, from there I will order the serpent to strike them.
30Am 9:4 Even if they go into exile among their enemies, from there I will order the sword to kill them. I will fix my gaze on them to inflict disaster, and not to do good.
30Am 9:5 "The Lord God of the Heavenly Armies who is touching the earth so that it melts and all of its inhabitants mourn there?the land rises like the Nile River, but sinks like the river of Egypt - 
30Am 9:6 who is building his stairway to heaven and setting its foundation on earth; who is calling for the waters of the sea and pouring them out over the surface of the land?the Lord is his name!
30Am 9:7 "Aren't you people of Israel like the people of Cush to me? declares the Lord. "I brought Israel up from the land of Egypt did I not, as well as the Philistines from Caphtor and the Arameans from Kir - 
30Am 9:8 Look! The eyes of the Lord God are on the sinful kingdom. I will destroy it from the face of the earth; but I will not totally destroy the house of Jacob," declares the Lord.
30Am 9:9 "Look! I'm giving the order£º I will sift the house of Israel throughout all the nations, as one sifts with a sieve, yet not a single kernel will reach the ground!
30Am 9:10 All sinners among my people will die by the sword, especially all who are saying, 'Disaster will not come upon or conquer us!'"
30Am 9:11 "At that time I will restore David's fallen tent, restoring its torn places. I will restore its ruins, rebuilding it as it was long ago,
30Am 9:12 so my people may inherit the remnant of Edom and all of the nations that bear my name," declares the Lord who is bringing this about.
30Am 9:13 "Look! The days are coming," declares the Lord, "when the one who sows will overtake the harvester and the treader of grapes will overtake the planter. Fresh wine will drip down from the mountains, cascading down from the hills.
30Am 9:14 I will surely restore my people Israel; they will rebuild the ruined cities and inhabit them. They will plant vineyards and drink the wine from them. They will plant gardens and eat the fruit from them.
30Am 9:15 I will plant the people of Israel in their own land, never again to be torn out of their land that I gave them," says the Lord your God.

31Ob 1:1 The vision of Obadiah. This is what the Lord God has to say about Edom. We have heard a report from the Lord, and a messenger has been dispatched among the nations to say "Get up! Let us rise up against her to fight!"
31Ob 1:2 "Look! I will make you insignificant among the nations; you will be utterly despised.
31Ob 1:3 The arrogance in your heart has deceived you, who inhabit hidden places on rocky cliffs, whose dwelling is in the heights, who say continually to yourself, 'Who will bring me down to the ground?
31Ob 1:4 Though you soar high like the eagle and make your nest among the stars, I will bring you down even from there," declares the Lord.
31Ob 1:5 "If thieves came against you, if marauding gangs by night?Oh, how you will be destroyed!?Would they not steal only until they had enough?If grape pickers came to you, would they not leave some grapes to be gleaned - 
31Ob 1:6 "Oh, how Esau is ransacked, how his hidden treasures are thoroughly searched out!
31Ob 1:7 All your allies will force you out of the land, your associates will deceive you and prevail against you. Your friends will lay out a trap for you, and you will never understand it!
31Ob 1:8 "In that day," declares the Lord, "will I not destroy the wise from Edom, and those with understanding from Esau's Mountain - 
31Ob 1:9 Teman, our mighty soldiers will be dismayed, so that every man from Esau's Mountain will be slaughtered."
31Ob 1:10 "Shame will overwhelm you because of the violence you inflicted on your brother Jacob, and you will be excluded forever.
31Ob 1:11 "On the day you just stood by, when strangers carried away Jacob's wealth and foreigners entered his gates, casting lots for Jerusalem, you were just like one of them.
31Ob 1:12 "You should not have gloated over your brother, on the day of his calamity. You should not have rejoiced when the descendants of Judah were perishing. You should not have boasted when they were in distress.
31Ob 1:13 "You should not have entered the gate of my people on the day of their disaster. Also, you should not have gloated over Judah's misfortune on the day of his disaster, nor should you have plundered his wealth on the day of his disaster.
31Ob 1:14 And you should not have taken your stand at the crossroads to cut down his fleeing refugees, nor should you have handed over his survivors on the day of his distress."
31Ob 1:15 "Indeed, the Day of the Lord approaches all nations. As you have done it will be done to you?your deeds will return to haunt you!
31Ob 1:16 Just as you have drunk from the cup of my wrath upon my holy mountain, so will all nations drink from the cup of my wrath perpetually. They will drink, they will gulp it down, and they will be as if they had never existed!
31Ob 1:17 "But there will be a delivered remnant on Mount Zion. There will be holiness, and the house of Jacob will take back their possessions."
31Ob 1:18 "The house of Jacob will be a fire, and the house of Joseph a flame, but the house of Esau will be kindling. The Jacob and Joseph will burn and consume Esau, and no survivor will remain from the house of Esau." Indeed, the Lord has spoken it.
31Ob 1:19 "Those in the Negev will possess Esau's Mountain, and those in the Shephelah the Philistines. They will possess the fields of Ephraim and the fields of Samaria, while Benjamin will possess the territory of Gilead.
31Ob 1:20 The exiles, the Israelite host, will possess the territory of the Canaanites all the way to Zarephath. The exiles of Jerusalem who are in Sepharad will possess the cities of the Negev.
31Ob 1:21 Deliverers will assemble on Mount Zion to judge Esau's Mountain, and to the Lord will the kingdom belong!"

32Jnh 1:1 Now the word of the Lord came to Amittai's son Jonah.
32Jnh 1:2 "Get up and go to Nineveh, that great city! Then cry out in protest against it, because their evil has come to my attention."
32Jnh 1:3 But Jonah got up and fled from the Lord to Tarshish. He went down to Joppa, and secured passage on a ship bound for Tarshish. He paid the fare and boarded, intending to go with the mariners to Tarshish to escape from the Lord.
32Jnh 1:4 Then the Lord sent a great wind over the sea, and a severe storm broke out. It seemed as if the ship were about to break up.
32Jnh 1:5 At this point the mariners became terrified, and each man cried out to his gods. They began to throw the cargo into the sea in order to lighten the vessel. But Jonah had gone down into the vessel's hold, had laid down, and was fast asleep.
32Jnh 1:6 So the captain approached him, and said to him, "What are you doing asleep?Get up! Call on your gods! Maybe your god will think about us so we won't die!"
32Jnh 1:7 Meanwhile, each crewman said to another, "Come, let's cast lots to find out whose fault it is that we're in this trouble." So they cast lots, and the lot indicated Jonah!
32Jnh 1:8 So they interrogated him£º "Tell us, why has this trouble come upon us?What's your occupation?Where'd you come from?What's your home country?What's your nationality?
32Jnh 1:9 "I'm a Hebrew," he replied, "and I'm afraid of the Lord God of heaven, who made the sea along with the dry land!"
32Jnh 1:10 In mounting fear, the men asked him, "What have you done? The men were aware that he was fleeing from the Lord, because he had admitted this to them.
32Jnh 1:11 Because the sea was growing more and more stormy, they asked him, "What must we do to you so the sea will calm down for us?1
32Jnh 1:12 Jonah said to them, "Pick me up and toss me into the sea. Then the sea will calm down for you, because I know that it's my fault that this mighty storm has come upon you."
32Jnh 1:13 Even so, the crewmen rowed hard to bring the ship toward dry land, but they were unsuccessful, because the sea was growing more and more stormy.1
32Jnh 1:14 At last they cried out to the Lord, "Please, Lord, do not let us perish because of this man's life, and do not hold us responsible for innocent blood, because you, Lord, have done what pleased you."
32Jnh 1:15 So they picked up Jonah and tossed him into the sea, and the sea stopped raging.
32Jnh 1:16 Then the men feared the Lord greatly, offered a sacrifice to the Lord, and made vows.1
32Jnh 1:17 Now the Lord had prepared a large sea creature to swallow Jonah, and Jonah was inside the sea creature for three days and three nights.
32Jnh 2:1 Then Jonah prayed to the Lord his God from inside the sea creature.
32Jnh 2:2 He said£º "I called out to the Lord from the midst of affliction directed at me, and he answered me. From the depths of death I cried out for help; and you heard my cry.
32Jnh 2:3 You cast me into the deep?into the heart of the sea. Flood waters engulfed me. All your breakers and your waves swirled over me.
32Jnh 2:4 So I said to myself, 'I have been driven away from you. How will I again gaze on your holy temple?
32Jnh 2:5 Flood waters encompassed me, the deep surrounded me while seaweeds wrapped around my head.
32Jnh 2:6 I sank to the roots of the mountains; the earth's prison bars closed around me forever. Yet you resurrect the dead from the Pit, Lord my God!"
32Jnh 2:7 "As my life was fading away, I remembered the Lord; and my prayer came to you in your holy temple.
32Jnh 2:8 Those who cling to vain idols leave behind the gracious love that could have been theirs.
32Jnh 2:9 But as for me, with a voice of thanksgiving I will sacrifice to you; what I have vowed I will pay. Deliverance is the Lord's!"
32Jnh 2:10 T hen the Lord spoke to the sea creature, and it spewed Jonah onto the dry land.
32Jnh 3:1 The word of the Lord came to Jonah a second time£º 
32Jnh 3:2 "Get up and go to Nineveh, that great city, and proclaim to it the message that I tell you."
32Jnh 3:3 So Jonah got up and went to Nineveh to do what Lord had ordered. Now Nineveh was a very large city, requiring a three-day journey to cross through it.
32Jnh 3:4 As Jonah started into the city on the first day's journey, he proclaimed the message, "40 days more and Nineveh will be overthrown!"
32Jnh 3:5 The people of Nineveh believed God. They called for a fast, and from the greatest to the least important of them, they put on sackcloth.
32Jnh 3:6 When the message reached the king of Nineveh, he got up from his throne, removed his royal garments, covered himself with sackcloth, and sat down in ashes.
32Jnh 3:7 Then he had this proclamation published throughout Nineveh£º "By decree of the king and his nobles£º No man or animal, herd or flock, shall taste anything, graze, or drink water.
32Jnh 3:8 Instead, let both man and animal clothe themselves with sackcloth and cry out to God forcefully. Let every person turn from his evil ways and from his tendency to do violence.
32Jnh 3:9 Who knows but that God may relent, have compassion, and turn from his fierce anger, so that we are not exterminated?
32Jnh 3:10 God took note of what they did - that they turned from their evil ways. Because God relented concerning the trouble about which he had warned them, he did not carry it out.
32Jnh 4:1 Greatly displeased, Jonah flew into a rage.
32Jnh 4:2 So he prayed to the Lord, "Lord, isn't this what I said while I was still in my home country?That's why I fled previously to Tarshish, because I knew you're a compassionate God, slow to anger, overflowing with gracious love, and reluctant to send trouble.
32Jnh 4:3 Therefore, Lord, please kill me, because it's better for me to die than to live!"
32Jnh 4:4 The Lord replied, "Does being angry make you right?
32Jnh 4:5 Then Jonah left the city and sat down on the eastern side. There he made a shelter for himself and sat down under its shade to see what would happen to the city.
32Jnh 4:6 The Lord God prepared a vine plant, and it grew over Jonah to shade his head and provide relief from his misery. Jonah was happy - indeed, he was ecstatic - about the vine plant.
32Jnh 4:7 But at dawn the next day, God provided a worm that attacked the vine plant so that it withered away.
32Jnh 4:8 When the sun rose, God prepared a harsh east wind. The sun beat down on Jonah's head, he became faint, and he begged to die. "It is better for me to die than to live!" he said.6
32Jnh 4:9 Then God asked Jonah, "Is your anger about the vine plant justified? And he answered, "Absolutely! I'm so angry I could die!"
32Jnh 4:10 But the Lord said, "You cared about a vine plant that you neither worked on nor cultivated?A vine plant that grew up overnight and died overnight - 
32Jnh 4:11 So why shouldn't I be concerned about Nineveh, that great city, in which there are more than
32Jnh 4:12 0,000 human beings who do not know their right hand from their left, as well as a lot of livestock -

33Mc 1:1 The word of the Lord that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of the Judean kings Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah concerning the vision he saw about Samaria and Jerusalem.
33Mc 1:2 "Listen, people! All of you! Earth! Pay attention, and all you inhabitants of it! May the Lord God be a witness against you?the Lord from his holy temple.
33Mc 1:3 Look here! The Lord is coming from his place! He will come down and will trample down the high places throughout the land.
33Mc 1:4 The mountains will melt under him and the valleys will split apart, like wax in the presence of fire and like water gushing down a steep incline.
33Mc 1:5 All this comes about due to the transgression of Jacob, and due to the sins of the house of Israel. What is Jacob's sin?It's Samaria, isn't it?And what's Judah's high place?It's Jerusalem, isn't it - 
33Mc 1:6 "So I will turn Samaria into a mound of dirt in a field, a place to plant vineyards. And I will dump her building stones into the valley, uncovering her foundation.
33Mc 1:7 All of her carved images will be crushed to pieces, all the earnings of her prostitution will be burned up, and I will destroy all her idols; because she collected the wages of prostitution, and to the wages of prostitution they will return."
33Mc 1:8 "Therefore I will cry out and grieve loudly; I will walk around stripped and naked. I will cry out like a jackal and mourn like a company of ostriches.
33Mc 1:9 For Samaria's injury is fatal, reaching all the way to Judah, extending even to the gate of my people - to Jerusalem."
33Mc 1:10 "Don't discuss it in Gath! Don't cry bitterly in Akim! Roll in the ashes, Beth-leaphrah!1
33Mc 1:11 Run away, you residents of Saphir, displaying your shameful nakedness. Don't come out, you residents of Zaanan! Your firm standing will disappear as Beth-ezel mourns.
33Mc 1:12 Even though the inhabitants of Maroth long for success, nevertheless evil descended from the Lord to the gate of Jerusalem.
33Mc 1:13 "You inhabitants of Lachish, harness your chariot to your swiftest steed?the daughter of Zion has begun to sin?because within you the transgressions of Israel were revealed.
33Mc 1:14 Therefore give your gifts to Moresheth-gath; that is, the houses of Achzib as a deceitful symbol to the kings of Israel.
33Mc 1:15 Nevertheless, I will deliver an heir to you, inhabitants of Mareshah?to Adullam the glory of Israel will come.
33Mc 1:16 "Shave your head and cut off your locks as you mourn your beloved children. Make yourself bald as an eagle, because they will go from you into exile!"
33Mc 2:1 "Woe to those who are crafting iniquity, planning evil well into the night! When morning's light comes, they carry out their plans because they have the power to do so.
33Mc 2:2 They covet fields and seize them;they covet houses, and grab them, too. They harass the valiant man, along with his household, an individual and his estate."
33Mc 2:3 Therefore this is what the Lord says, "I'm crafting evil against this family, from which you can't escape. You won't strut around arrogantly, because the times are evil.
33Mc 2:4 When this happens, someone will compose a proverb about you, lamenting sorrowfully, 'We are completely ruined! He has given my people's heritage to others. How he has removed it from me, dividing up our fields!'
33Mc 2:5 This is why there will not be left even a single person to settle boundary disputes in the Lord's community.
33Mc 2:6 To those who speak out, they will declare, 'Don't prophesy to anyone!' so their shame won't go away.
33Mc 2:7 "It is said, house of Jacob, 'The Spirit of the Lord is limited, if he acts this way, is he not? But my words benefit those who live righteously, do they not - 
33Mc 2:8 Lately my people have acted like an enemy?you strip travelers who thought they were as secure as those who return from war.
33Mc 2:9 You have evicted the wives of my people from their dream homes; you have removed my majesty from their children permanently.
33Mc 2:10 "Get up and go, for there's no rest for you here! Since everything is polluted, it can only cause destruction, even heavy destruction.
33Mc 2:11 Suppose a man who keeps company with a deceiving spirit prophesies like this£º 'Drink wine and strong drink!' Won't the people accept him as a prophet?
33Mc 2:12 "Jacob, how I will surely gather all of you! How I will gather the survivors of Israel! I will gather them together like sheep in a pen, like the flock in the midst of the sheepfold. There will be a great commotion because of all the people.
33Mc 2:13 God will stand up and break through in their presence. Then they will pass through the gate, going out by it. Their king will pass in front of them with the Lord at their head.
33Mc 3:1 He will say, 'Listen, you leaders of Jacob, you officials of the house of Israel! You should know justice, should you not - 
33Mc 3:2 you who despise good and love evil, who tear off the skin of my people, along with the flesh from their bones.
33Mc 3:3 You eat the flesh of my people, flaying their skin from them. You break their bones, chopping them in pieces like meat for a pot, like meat destined for a soup kettle.'"
33Mc 3:4 Then they will cry to the Lord, but he will not listen to them. In fact, he will hide his face from them at that time, because they were so wicked in what they were doing.
33Mc 3:5 This is what the Lord says about the prophetswho are causing my people to go astray, who are calling out "Peace" when they're being fed, but who declare war against those who won't feed them£º 
33Mc 3:6 "You will have nights without visions, and darkness without prophecy. The sun will set on the prophets, and the day will darken for them.
33Mc 3:7 Those who see visions will be put to shame, and the diviners will be disgraced - every one of them?they will cover their faces, because there will be no answer from God."
33Mc 3:8 "As for me, I am truly filled with power by the Spirit of the Lord, filled with judgment and power to announce to Jacob his transgression, and to Israel his sin.
33Mc 3:9 Please listen to this, you leaders of the house of Jacob, you officials of the house of Israel, you who hate administering justice, who pervert the very meaning of equity,
33Mc 3:10 who are building up Zion by means of bloodshed, and Jerusalem by means of iniquity.
33Mc 3:11 Her leaders judge for the money, her priests teach only when they're paid , and her prophets prophesy for cash. Even so, don't they all rely on the Lord as they ask, 'The Lord is among us, is he not?Nothing bad can possibly happen to us!'
33Mc 3:12 Therefore, because of you, Zion will be plowed up like a field, and Jerusalem will become heaps of rubble, and the temple Mount like a forest high place."
33Mc 4:1 "But in the last days it will come about that the temple Mount of the Lord will be firmly set as the leading mountain. It will be exalted above its surrounding hills, and people will stream toward it.
33Mc 4:2 Many nations will approach and say, 'Come, let's go up to the mountain of the Lord, and to the temple of the God of Jacob. He will teach us about his ways, and we will walk according to his directions.' Indeed, the law will proceed from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
33Mc 4:3 And he will judge among many people, rebuking strong nations far away; and they will reshape their swords as plowshares and their spears as pruning hooks. No nation will threaten another, nor will they train for war any more.
33Mc 4:4 Instead, each man will sit in the shade of his grape vines and beneath the shade of his fig tree," since the Lord of the Heavenly Armies has spoken.
33Mc 4:5 Because all of the people will walk, each person in the name of his God, and we will walk in the name of the Lord our God forever and ever.
33Mc 4:6 "At that time," declares the Lord, "I will assemble the lame; and I will gather those whom I have scattered, along with those whom I have afflicted.
33Mc 4:7 I will transform the lame into survivors, and those who were scattered into a strong nation; and the Lord will reign over them in Mount Zion, now and forever."
33Mc 4:8 "And you, watchtower of the flock, you stronghold of the daughter of Zion, it will happen even to you£º The former dominion, even the kingdom of the daughter of Jerusalem, will come.
33Mc 4:9 Why are you crying so loud now?There's no king among you, is there?Perhaps your advisor has died?For pain has overtaken you like a woman in labor.
33Mc 4:10 Be in pain! Be in labor, you daughter of Zion, like a woman about to give birth, because now you will depart from the city, living in the open fields. To Babylon you will go. There you will be delivered, there the Lord will rescue you from the power of your enemies."
33Mc 4:11 "Now many nations have gathered against you, saying, 'Let her be defiled,' and 'Let's look down on Zion.'
33Mc 4:12 But they don't know the thoughts of the Lord, and they don't understand his tactics, for he will gather them like harvested grain to his threshing floor.
33Mc 4:13 Get up and smash them to pieces, daughter of Zion, because I will make your horn like iron and your hooves like bronze! And you will beat many people to pieces, and I will consecrate their dishonest gain to the Lord and their assets to the Lord of the entire earth.
33Mc 5:1 Now marshal yourselves as troops. He has laid siege to us. They will strike the judge of Israel on the cheek with a rod.
33Mc 5:2 "As for you, Bethlehem of Ephrathah, even though you remain least among the clans of Judah, nevertheless, the one who rules in Israel for me will emerge from you. His existence has been from antiquity, even from eternity.
33Mc 5:3 Therefore that ruler will abandon them until the woman in labor gives birth. Then the rest of his countrymen will return to the Israelites."
33Mc 5:4 "Then he will take his stand, shepherding by means of the strength of the Lord, by the power of the name of the Lord his God. And they will be firmly established; indeed, from then on he will become great?to the ends of the earth.
33Mc 5:5 And he will be our peace." When the Assyrian invades our land, trampling through our palaces, we will raise up seven shepherds against him, even eight significant men.
33Mc 5:6 The shepherds will devastate the land of Assyria with the sword, along with the entrances to the land of Nimrod. This is how he will vanquish Assyria when he invades our land, trampling within our borders£º 
33Mc 5:7 The survivors of Jacob will live among many peoples, as dew from the Lord, as showers upon the grass. They will look to no one, and will place no hope in human beings.
33Mc 5:8 The survivors of Jacob will live among the nations; they will live among many peoples, like a lion among flocks of sheep, who, if he passes through, will trample and tear down with no one to deliver.
33Mc 5:9 You will turn your power against your adversaries, and all of your enemies will be cut down.
33Mc 5:10 "It will come about at that time," declares the Lord, "I will tear away your horses from you, and I will destroy your chariots.
33Mc 5:11 I will cut off the cities of your land, and I will tear down all of your fortifications.
33Mc 5:12 I will render your witchcraft powerless, and mediums will no longer exist among you.
33Mc 5:13 I will separate you from your carved images and sacred pillars, and will you no longer worship what you've made with your hands.
33Mc 5:14 I will uproot your cultic gods from you, and I will tear down your cities.
33Mc 5:15 I will execute vengeance, anger, and fury on the nations who do not obey."
33Mc 6:1 Please hear what the Lord says£º "Get up and make your case before the mountains, and let the hills listen to your voice.
33Mc 6:2 Listen, you mountains, to the Lord's argument! Listen, you strong foundations of the earth, because the Lord has a dispute with his people, and he will set out his case before Israel.
33Mc 6:3 "My people, what have I done to you, and how have I offended you?Answer me!
33Mc 6:4 For I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and ransomed you from the house of slavery, sending Moses, Aaron, and Miriam into your presence.
33Mc 6:5 "My people, recall how king Balak of Moab deliberated, and how Beor's son Balaam counseled him from Shittim to Gilgal, so that you may know the righteousness of the Lord."
33Mc 6:6 How am I to present myself in the Lord's presence and bow in the presence of the High God?Should I present myself with burnt offerings, with year-old calves - 
33Mc 6:7 Will the Lord be pleased with thousands of rams, or with endless rivers of oil?Am I to give my firstborn to pay for my rebellion, the fruit of my body in exchange for my soul - 
33Mc 6:8 He has made it clear to you, mortal man, what is good and what the Lord is requiring from you?to act with justice, to treasure the Lord's gracious love, and to walk humbly in the company of your God.
33Mc 6:9 The voice of the Lord cries out to the city?wisdom fears your name. "Heed the rod, and the one who prepared it!
33Mc 6:10 Are there still wicked treasures in the house of the wicked, along with deceitful and abominable measuring standards - 
33Mc 6:11 Will I tolerate those who maintain deceptive standards and who use deceitful weights in their business - 
33Mc 6:12 Her rich people are filled with violence, and her inhabitants tell lies?their tongues speak deceitfully!
33Mc 6:13 "Therefore I will make you ill when I attack you; I will bring you to ruin because of your offenses.
33Mc 6:14 You'll eat, but you won't have enough; and hunger will be common among you. You'll horde things, but you won't save them, and what you preserve I'll give over to the sword.
33Mc 6:15 You'll plant, but you won't reap. You'll crush the olive harvest, but you'll have no oil to anoint yourself. You'll tread out the grapes, but you'll never drink wine.
33Mc 6:16 You keep Omri's statutes and observe the customs of the house of Ahab. Because you live according to their advice, I'll make you desolate and turn your inhabitants into an object of scorn. Therefore you will bear the shame of my people."
33Mc 7:1 Poor me! I feel like those who harvest summer fruit, or like those who pick grapes?there are no clusters to eat or any fresh fruit that I want.
33Mc 7:2 The faithful have died off, and there is not one upright human being in the land. They all stalk one another with lethal intent, a man will even hunt his own brother with a net.
33Mc 7:3 And speaking of evil, they practice it eagerly - with both hands! Both leader and judge demand a bribe, the famous confess their perverted desires, and they scheme together.
33Mc 7:4 The best of them is like a thorn, and their most upright like a hedge of thorns. The day announced by your watchmen?and by your own calculations?approaches. Now it's your time to be confused!
33Mc 7:5 Don't trust your friends, don't confide in a companion, watch what you say to your wife.
33Mc 7:6 The son disrespects his father, the daughter rebels against her mother, the daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law, and a man's enemies are the people of his own house.
33Mc 7:7 But as for me, I will look to the Lord; I will wait for the God who will deliver me. My God will hear me.
33Mc 7:8 Don't be glad on my account, my enemy. When I fall, I'll get up. Though I sit in darkness, the Lord is a light for me.
33Mc 7:9 I will endure the Lord's anger?since I have sinned against him?until he takes over my defense, administers justice on my behalf, and brings me out to the light, where I will gaze on his righteousness.
33Mc 7:10 Then my enemy will observe it, and shame will engulf the ones who asked me, 'Where is the Lord your God? My own eyes will see them, they will be trampled on like mud in the streets.
33Mc 7:11 When the time comes for rebuilding your walls, that time will surely be extended.
33Mc 7:12 At that time armies will invade you from Assyria, from Egyptian cities to the Euphrates River, from sea to sea and from mountain to mountain.
33Mc 7:13 The land will become desolate because of its inhabitants, and as a result of their behavior.
33Mc 7:14 Use your rod to shepherd your people, the flock that belongs to you, that lives alone in the forest of Carmel. Let them find pasture in Bashan and Gilead, as they did long ago.
33Mc 7:15 As I did when you came out of the land of Egypt, I will show you awesome things.
33Mc 7:16 The nations will look on and will be ashamed in spite of all their power; they will cup their hands over their mouths, and their ears will be deaf.
33Mc 7:17 They will lick the dust like a serpent; they will crawl from their strongholds like snakes. They will fear the Lord our God. They will be terrified because of you.
33Mc 7:18 Is there any God like you, forgiving iniquity, passing over transgressions by the survivors who are your heritage?He is not angry forever, because he delights in gracious love.
33Mc 7:19 He will again show us compassion; he will subdue our iniquities. You will hurl all their sins into the deepest sea.
33Mc 7:20 You will remain true to Jacob, and merciful to Abraham, as you promised our ancestors long ago.

34Nah 1:1 A pronouncement about Nineveh£º The record of the vision of Nahum from Elkosh.
34Nah 1:2 A jealous God, the Lord avenges. The Lord avenges; The Lord is an angry husband. The Lord takes vengeance on his enemies, reserving anger for his adversaries.
34Nah 1:3 The Lord is slow to anger and powerful, and he will never let the guilty go unpunished. The Lord's path is in the windstorm and hurricane; thunderclouds are dust beneath his feet.
34Nah 1:4 He rebukes the sea, and it evaporates; he dries up all the rivers. Bashan and Carmel wither, while the flowers of Lebanon languish.
34Nah 1:5 Mountains shake because of him, and the hills melt. The earth goes into upheaval at his presence, as does the world with all of its inhabitants.
34Nah 1:6 Who can stand before his fury?And who can endure his fierce anger?His displeasure pours out like fire, and rocks are broken to pieces because of him.
34Nah 1:7 The Lord is good?a refuge in troubled times. He knows those who are confiding in him.
34Nah 1:8 But with an overwhelming deluge he will bring utter desolation to Nineveh, and his enemies he will pursue with darkness.
34Nah 1:9 What are you scheming against the Lord?He will bring about utter desolation?adversity will not strike twice!
34Nah 1:10 Indeed, while tangled as by a thorn bush, while drunken as by a strong drink, the Ninevites will be burned like dry straw.
34Nah 1:11 Someone has left you who plans evil against the Lord. He is a demonic counselor.
34Nah 1:12 This is what the Lord says£º "No matter how strong they are, and no matter how numerous, they will surely be annihilated and pass away. Though I have afflicted you, I will do so no more.
34Nah 1:13 Now I will break off Assyria's yoke from you, and tear apart your shackles."
34Nah 1:14 Now this is what the Lord has decreed about you, Nineveh£º "There will be no more children born to carry on your name. I will cut out the graven and molten images from the temples of your gods. I myself will dig your grave, because you are vile."
34Nah 1:15 Look! There on the mountains! The feet of the one who brings good news, who broadcasts a message of peace. Judah, celebrate your solemn feasts and keep your vows, because the wicked will never again invade you. Nineveh will be completely eliminated!
34Nah 2:1 You are being attacked by advancing forces! Guard your rampart! Watch your roads! Prepare yourselves! Marshall your defenses!
34Nah 2:2 For the Lord will restore the glory of Jacob, just as he will restore the glory of Israel, although plunderers have devastated them, vandalizing their vine branches.
34Nah 2:3 The shields deployed by Israel's elite forces are scarlet, their valiant men are clothed in crimson. When they are prepared, the polished armament on their chariots will shine, and lances will be brandished about ferociously.
34Nah 2:4 Their chariots storm through the streets, jostling each other along broad avenues. They look like torches, as they dart around like lightning.
34Nah 2:5 He will remember to summon his finest troops. They will stumble on their way, hurrying over to Nineveh's wall. Their defensive shield is in place.
34Nah 2:6 The river gates will be opened, and the palace will collapse.
34Nah 2:7 It has been determined£º The woman is unveiled and sent away, her servant girls mourn. Beating their breasts, they whimper like doves.
34Nah 2:8 Nineveh is a reservoir whose water is draining away. "Wait! Wait!" they cry, yet not even one person looks back.
34Nah 2:9 Take the silver! Take the gold! There is no end to the treasure?fabulous riches of every imagination.
34Nah 2:10 Nineveh is devastated, deserted, and desolate. Her heart melts, her knees knock. Every stomach is upset, every face grows pale.
34Nah 2:11 Where is this lion's den?Where is the place where the young lions fed, where the lion and its mate walked with their young, the place where they feared nothing - 
34Nah 2:12 This lion renders its prey to pieces to feed its whelps, and strangles enough prey for its mate, filling its lairs with prey and its dens with rendered flesh.
34Nah 2:13 "I am against you," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "and I will send your chariots up in smoke. A sword will devour your young lions, I will eliminate your prey from the earth, and the voice of your messengers will no longer be heard."
34Nah 3:1 Woe to this city, contaminated with shed blood, all full of lies and robberies?it is never without victims!
34Nah 3:2 The crack of whips and the clamor of wheels! The galloping horses and the bounding chariots!
34Nah 3:3 The cavalry attacks?the flashing sword and the glittering spear! Many are the slain?so many casualties!?No end to bodies, and the soldiers trip over the corpses.
34Nah 3:4 Innumerable are the harlotries of this well-favored whore, this mistress of witchcraft, who enslaves nations through her fornication and families through her sorcery.
34Nah 3:5 "Look, I am against you," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "so I will pull up your dress over your face. I will show your nakedness to the nations, and your disgrace to the kingdoms.
34Nah 3:6 I will hurl abominable filth upon you, making you look foolish, and making an example of you.
34Nah 3:7 It will be that everyone who looks at you will run away, saying, 'Nineveh has been violently overthrown! Who will mourn for her?Where will I find anyone to comfort you?"
34Nah 3:8 "Are you any better than Thebes, which sits by the upper Nile, surrounded by water?The sea was her defense, the waters her wall of protection.
34Nah 3:9 Sudan was her source of strength, along with Egypt?there were no limits. Put and the Libyans were her allies.
34Nah 3:10 But she, too, was exiled?she went into captivity! Her young children were dashed to pieces at every crossroad of their streets, and her famous citizens were sold by lottery, while all of her aristocrats were put in chains.
34Nah 3:11 You will also become drunk. You will disappear, trying to hide from your enemies.
34Nah 3:12 All your defenses are like fig trees with ripe early fruit?when shaken, it falls right into the devourer's mouth."
34Nah 3:13 "Look at your people?they are women! Your borders stand wide open to your enemies, while fire consumes the bars of your gates.
34Nah 3:14 Draw water, because a siege is coming! Strengthen your fortresses! Make the clay good and strong! Mix the mortar! Go get your brick molds!
34Nah 3:15 In that place fire will consume you, the sword will cut you down, consuming you as locusts do. Multiply yourself like locusts, increase like swarming grasshoppers.
34Nah 3:16 You added to your inventory of businessmen?they number more than the stars of heaven. The creeping locust sheds its skin and flies away.
34Nah 3:17 Your imperial guards are like the swarming grasshopper; your marshals are like hordes of grasshoppers, settling in the stone walls on a chilly day. The sun rises, and they flee away; no one knows where they went.
34Nah 3:18 Hey king of Assyria! Your shepherds are asleep and your nobles are lying down! Your people lie scattered on the mountains, and there is no one to gather them together.
34Nah 3:19 There is no healing for your injury?your wound is fatal. Everyone who hears about you will applaud, because who hasn't escaped your endless evil -

35Hab 1:1 The pronouncement that the prophet Habakkuk perceived.
35Hab 1:2 "How long, Lord, must I cry out for help, but you won't listen?I'm crying out to you, 'Oppression!' but you aren't providing deliverance.
35Hab 1:3 Why are you forcing me to look at iniquity and to stare at wickedness?Social havoc and oppression are all around me; there are legal conflicts, and disputes abound.
35Hab 1:4 Therefore, the law has become paralyzed, and justice never comes about. Because criminals outnumber the righteous, whenever judgments are issued, they come out crooked."
35Hab 1:5 "Look out at the nations and pay attention! Be astounded! Be really astounded! Because something is happening in your lifetime that you won't believe, even if it were described down to the smallest detail.
35Hab 1:6 Watch out! For I am bringing in the Chaldeans, that cruel and impetuous people, who sweep across the earth dispossessing people from homes not their own.
35Hab 1:7 They are terrible and fearsome; their brand of justice and sense of honor derive only from themselves!
35Hab 1:8 Their horses are swifter than leopards, and more cunning than wolves that attack at night. Their horsemen are galloping as they approach from far away. They swoop in like ravenous vultures.
35Hab 1:9 "They all come to oppress?hordes of them, their faces pressing onward?they take prisoners as numerous as the desert sand!
35Hab 1:10 They make fun of kings, deriding those who rule. They laugh at all of the fortified places, constructing ramps to seize them.
35Hab 1:11 Then like the wind sweeping by they will pass through?they're guilty because they say their power is their god."
35Hab 1:12 "Haven't you existed forever, Lord my God, my Holy One?We won't die! Lord, you've prepared them for judgment; Rock, you've sentenced them to correction.
35Hab 1:13 Your eyes are too pure to gaze upon evil; and you cannot tolerate wickedness. So why do you tolerate the treacherous?And why do you stay silent while the wicked devour those who are more righteous than they are - 
35Hab 1:14 You have fashioned mankind like fish in the ocean, like creeping things that have no ruler.
35Hab 1:15 "The adversary captures them with a hook, gathering them up in a fishing net. He collects them with a dragnet, rejoicing and gloating over his catch.
35Hab 1:16 Therefore he sacrifices to his fishing net, and burns incense in the presence of his dragnet, because by them his assets increase and he gets plenty of food.
35Hab 1:17 Is he to continue to empty his fishing net?Will he ever stop killing entire nations without mercy?
35Hab 2:1 "I will stand at my guard post and station myself on a tower. I will wait and see what the Lord will say about me and what I will answer when he reprimands me."
35Hab 2:2 When he answered, the Lord said to me£º "Write out the revelation, engraving it clearly on the tablets, so that a courier may run with it.
35Hab 2:3 For the revelation pertains to an appointed time?it speaks truthfully about the end. Though it delays, wait for it, because it will surely come about?it will not be late!
35Hab 2:4 "Notice their arrogance?they have no inward uprightness?but the righteous will live by their faith.
35Hab 2:5 Moreover, just as wine leads astray the proud and powerful man, he remains restless; he has expanded his appetite?like the afterlife or death itself, he is never satisfied. He gathers to himself all of the nations, taking captive all of the people for himself."
35Hab 2:6 "Will not all of these ridicule him with mocking scorn?They will say, 'Woe to the one who hordes for himself what isn't his. How long will you enrich yourself by extortion?
35Hab 2:7 Won't your creditors revolt unexpectedly?Won't those who make you tremble wake up?As a result, you'll become their prey!
35Hab 2:8 Because you plundered many nations, all of their remnants will plunder you. Human blood has been shed, and violence has been done to the land, to the city, and to all who live in it."
35Hab 2:9 "Woe to the one who amasses profit upon unjust profit in order to establish his household, so he can establish a secure place on the heights and escape from the power of evil.
35Hab 2:10 You have brought shame to yourself by killing many people?you are forfeiting your own life.
35Hab 2:11 Indeed, the stone will cry out from the wall and the rafter will respond from the woodwork."
35Hab 2:12 "Woe to the one who founds a city upon bloodshed, and constructs a city by lawlessness.
35Hab 2:13 Is it not because of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies that people grow tired putting out fires, and nations weary themselves over nothing - 
35Hab 2:14 Indeed, the earth will be filled with knowledge of the glory of the Lord, as water fills the sea."
35Hab 2:15 "Woe to the one who supplies his neighbor with a drink! You are forcing your bottle on him, making him drunk so you can see them naked.
35Hab 2:16 You are filled with dishonor instead of glory. So go ahead, drink and be naked! The Lord will turn against you, and utter disgrace will debase your reputation.
35Hab 2:17 Indeed, the violence done to Lebanon will overtake you, and the destruction of the beasts will terrorize you?because you shed human blood and did violence to the land, to the city, and to all who live in it.
35Hab 2:18 "Where is the benefit in owning a carved image, that motivates its maker to carve it?It is only a cast image?a teacher that lies?because the engraver entrusts himself to his carving, crafting speechless idols.
35Hab 2:19 "Woe to the one who says to a tree, 'Wake up!' or 'Arise!' to a speechless stone. Idols like this can't teach, can they?Look, even though it is overlaid with gold and silver, there's no breath in it at all.
35Hab 2:20 "The Lord is in his holy temple. All the earth - be quiet in his presence."
35Hab 3:1 A prayer by the prophet Habakkuk, set to music.
35Hab 3:2 Lord, as I listen to what has been said about you, I am afraid. Lord, revive your work throughout all of our lives?reveal yourself throughout all of our lives?when you are angry, remember compassion.
35Hab 3:3 God comes from Teman?the Holy One from Mount Paran. Interlude His glory spreads throughout the heavens, and praises about him fill the earth.
35Hab 3:4 His radiance is like sunlight; beams of light shine from his hand, where his strength lays hidden.
35Hab 3:5 Before him pestilence walks, and disease follows behind him.
35Hab 3:6 He stood up and shook the land; with his stare he startled the nations. The age-old mountains were shattered, and the ancient hilltops bowed down. His ways are eternal.
35Hab 3:7 I saw the tents of Cushan in distress, and the tent curtains of the land of Midian in anguish.
35Hab 3:8 Was the Lord displeased with the rivers?Was your anger directed against the watercourses or your wrath against the sea?Indeed, you rode upon your horses, upon your chariots of deliverance.
35Hab 3:9 Your bow was exposed, and your arrows targeted by command. Interlude You split the earth with rivers.
35Hab 3:10 When the mountains looked upon you, they trembled; the overflowing water passed by, the ocean shouted, and its waves surged upward.
35Hab 3:11 The sun and moon stand still in their orbits; at the glint of your arrows they speed along, even at the gleam of your flashing spear.
35Hab 3:12 You march through the land in righteous indignation; you tread down the nations in anger.
35Hab 3:13 You marched out to deliver your people, to deliver with your anointed. You struck the head of the house of the wicked; you stripped him naked from head to foot. Interlude
35Hab 3:14 With his own lances you pierced the heads of his warriors, who came out like a windstorm to scatter us?their joy is to devour the afflicted who are in hiding.
35Hab 3:15 You rode on the sea with your horses, even riding the crested waves of mighty waters.
35Hab 3:16 I heard and I trembled within. My lips quivered at the noise. My legs gave way beneath me, and I trembled. Nevertheless, I await the day of distress that will dawn on our invaders.
35Hab 3:17 Even though the fig tree does not blossom, and there are no grapes on the vines; even if the olive harvest fails, and the fields produce nothing edible; even if the flock is snatched from the sheepfold, and there is no herd in the stalls - 
35Hab 3:18 as for me, I will rejoice in the Lord. I will find my joy in the God who delivers me.
35Hab 3:19 The Lord God is my strength?he will make my feet like those of a deer, equipping me to tread on my mountain heights.

36Zph 1:1 The word of the LORD that came to Cushi's son Zephaniah, the grandson of Gedaliah and great-grandson of Hezekiah's son Amariah, during the reign of Amon's son Josiah, king of Judah.
36Zph 1:2 "I'll utterly sweep away everything from the land," declares the Lord.
36Zph 1:3 "I'll consume both human beings and animals?I'll consume the birds of the sky, the fish in the sea, and the wicked along with their sin, when I eliminate human beings from the land," declares the Lord.
36Zph 1:4 "I will also stretch out my hand against Judah, and upon all inhabitants of Jerusalem. I'll wipe out every trace of Baal from this place, and the name of the pagan priests, along with my own priests.
36Zph 1:5 I'll wipe out those who worship the stars that they view from their housetops, those who bow down and swear to the Lord and who also swear by Milcom,
36Zph 1:6 those who turn away from the Lord, don't seek the Lord, and never ask for his help."
36Zph 1:7 Remain silent in the presence of the Lord God, because the Day of the Lord approaches, and because the Lord has prepared a sacrifice for those whom he has invited to be consecrated.
36Zph 1:8 "It will come about during the Lord's sacrifice that I'll punish the officials, the royal descendants, and all who wear foreign clothing.
36Zph 1:9 At the same time, I'll punish every idol worshipper, especially those who are filling their master's temple with violence and deceit.
36Zph 1:10 When all of this happens," declares the Lord, "a loud shriek will come from the Fish Gate, and howling from the Mishneh Quarter, along with great destruction from the hills."
36Zph 1:11 "Wail, you who live in the market district, because all of the merchants will be crushed and all of their customers will be eliminated.
36Zph 1:12 And it will come about that I will search Jerusalem with candles, punishing the self-satisfied and complacent, who say to themselves, 'The Lord will do neither good nor evil.'
36Zph 1:13 "Therefore their possessions will be seized as plunder and their homes left in ruins. They may build houses, but they won't live in them. They may plant vineyards, but they won't drink their wine."
36Zph 1:14 "The great Day of the Lord approaches?How it comes, hurrying faster and faster! The sound of the Day of the Lord there includes the bitter cry of the mighty soldier.
36Zph 1:15 That day will be filled with wrath, a day of trouble and tribulation; a day of desolation and devastation, a day of doom and gloom, a day of clouds and shadows.
36Zph 1:16 a day of trumpet and battle cry against fortified cites and watch towers.
36Zph 1:17 "And I'll bring so much distress to people that they will walk around like the blind. Because they have sinned against the Lord, their blood will be poured out like dust and their intestines will spill out like manure.
36Zph 1:18 Neither their silver nor their gold will deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath; but the entire land will be consumed by the fire of his jealousy, for he will bring the inhabitants of the land to a sudden end."
36Zph 2:1 "Gather together! Yes, indeed, gather together, You shameless nation!
36Zph 2:2 Before the decree is carried out, before the day flies away like chaff, before the fierce anger of the Lord visits you, before the day of the Lord's wrath surprises you
36Zph 2:3 seek the Lord, all you humble people of the land, who do what he commands. Seek righteousness! Seek humility! Maybe you will be protected in the day of the Lord's anger."
36Zph 2:4 "For Gaza will be forsaken, and Ashkelon deserted?Ashdod will be emptied at high noon; even Ekron will be uprooted.
36Zph 2:5 Woe to those who live along the coast, the people of Philistia! The word of the Lord is being spoken against you, Canaan, land of the Philistines. I'll destroy you until no one lives there!
36Zph 2:6 The Philistine coast will become meadows for shepherds and sheep pens.
36Zph 2:7 The survivors of Judah will find pasture on it; at twilight they will lie down in the houses of Ashkelon, for the Lord their God will visit them, restoring their prosperity."
36Zph 2:8 "I've heard Moab's insults and the curses from those Ammonites by which they defame my people and boast about their territory.
36Zph 2:9 Therefore as I'm alive and living," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, "Moab will surely become like Sodom, and the Ammonites like Gomorrah, a place overrun by weeds and salty marshes, unpopulated forever. The survivors of my people will confiscate their property, and those who remain of my nation will inherit what was theirs.
36Zph 2:10 This they shall have in lieu of their pride, because they have insulted and mocked the people of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
36Zph 2:11 The Lord will incite them to terror, because he will cause all the gods of the earth to waste away. They will worship him, every person in his own home, including even the coastlands of the nations."
36Zph 2:12 "Now as for you, Cush, you will surely be slain by my sword!
36Zph 2:13 "And the Lord will attack the north, destroying Assyria. He will turn Nineveh into a desolate ruin, as dry as a desert wilderness.
36Zph 2:14 Flocks will lie down in her midst, along with animals of every kind. Desert owls and screeching owls will nest at the top of the pillars, hooting through the vacant windows 'Ruin sits at these doorsills,' for he will expose even the cedar framework.
36Zph 2:15 This is that carefree city that lived irresponsibly, that said to herself, 'Me first!' and 'There will be no one else!' How ruined she has become?a habitat for wild animals! Everyone who passes by her will sneer at her and make obscene gestures!"
36Zph 3:1 Woe to this filthy, polluted, and oppressive city!
36Zph 3:2 It won't obey anyone. It won't accept discipline. It does not trust in the Lord. It does not approach God.
36Zph 3:3 Its national officials are roaring lions; its judges are like wolves of the night that don't leave the bones for the morning.
36Zph 3:4 Its prophets are arrogant and treacherous. Its priests have contaminated the sanctuary. They give perverse interpretations of the Law.
36Zph 3:5 The righteous Lord who lives within her will do no wrong; he will bring justice to light morning by morning. He never fails, but the unjust are shameless.
36Zph 3:6 "I have destroyed nations?their fortifications are deserted. I have turned their main thoroughfares into wastelands where no one will travel. Their cities are desolate; as a result, not one man remains - no, not even a single resident.
36Zph 3:7 I have said, 'If only you would fear me, if only you would take my instructions to heart.' Then their houses would not have been torn down. I have chastened them, but they were eager to corrupt everything they were doing."
36Zph 3:8 "Just you wait!" declares the Lord. "The day will come when I stand up as a prosecutor, for I am determined to assemble the nations and to gather the kingdoms, in order to pour out my indignation upon them?all of my fierce anger. All the earth will be consumed by the fire of my jealousy.
36Zph 3:9 Indeed, then I will return my people to a pure language so that they all may call upon the name of the Lord, serving him with a united will."
36Zph 3:10 "From beyond the rivers of Cush my worshipers?including my dispersed people?will present offerings to me.
36Zph 3:11 When this happens, you will not be ashamed of your actions by which you sinned against me, because I will remove from among you those who revel in pride. Arrogance will have no place in my holy mountain.
36Zph 3:12 I will keep a humble and gentle people among you, and they will trust in the name of the Lord.
36Zph 3:13 The survivors of Israel will not practice lawlessness nor tell lies, nor will a deceitful word be found in their mouths, because they will eat and rest, with no one to cause fear."
36Zph 3:14 "Sing aloud, daughter of Zion! Shout out, Israel! Rejoice with all of your heart, daughter of Jerusalem!
36Zph 3:15 The Lord has acquitted you; turning back your adversaries. Israel's king, the Lord, is among you; you will not fear disaster any more.
36Zph 3:16 "When all of this happens, it will be said to Jerusalem, 'Don't be afraid!" and to Zion, 'Don't lose courage!"
36Zph 3:17 "The Lord your God among you is powerful?he will save and he will take joyful delight in you. In his love he will renew you with his love; he will celebrate with singing because of you.
36Zph 3:18 I will gather the afflicted from the solemn assembly; those who were with you, who were bearing a burden of disgrace.
36Zph 3:19 "Watch how I deal with everyone who oppresses you! At that time I will rescue the one who is lame, and I will draw to me the one who has been driven away. I will honor them with praise and with a good reputation in every land where they have been put to shame.
36Zph 3:20 At that time I will gather you; at that time I will bring you home. Indeed, I will give you a good reputation, making you praiseworthy among all of the people of the world, when I restore your prosperity before your eyes," says the Lord.

37Hg 1:1 On the first day of the sixth month of the second year of the reign of King Darius, the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet to Shealtiel's son Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, and to Jehozadak's son Joshua, the high priest.
37Hg 1:2 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'These people keep saying, "No, the right time for rebuilding the LORD's temple has not yet come."'"
37Hg 1:3 Then the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet£º 
37Hg 1:4 "Is it the right time for all of you to live in your own paneled houses while this house remains in ruins?
37Hg 1:5 "Now this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, says£º 'Carefully consider your ways£º 
37Hg 1:6 You have sowed much but have reaped little. You have eaten but don't have enough to become satisfied. You have drunk but don't have enough to become intoxicated. You have clothed yourself but don't have enough to keep warm. And the hired laborer deposits his salary in a bag full of holes!'"
37Hg 1:7 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'Carefully consider your ways£º 
37Hg 1:8 Go up into the mountains, bring timber, and reconstruct my house. Then I will be pleased with it and I will be honored,' says the Lord.
37Hg 1:9 'You turned away in pursuit of abundance, but look at how little you found! What you did manage to bring home, I blew away! And why? declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. 'It's because of my house! It lies in ruins while each of you runs off to his own house!
37Hg 1:10 That is why the heavens keep withholding dew from you, and the earth withholds her fruit.
37Hg 1:11 I sent a drought on the land, on the mountains, on your grain, on your new wines, on your oil - on everything the ground produces - on men, on livestock, and on everything you do!'"1
37Hg 1:12 Then Shealtiel's son Zerubbabel, Jehozadak's son Joshua the high priest, and all the rest of the people obeyed the Lord their God and the words of Haggai the prophet, because the Lord their God had sent him. And the people feared the Lord.
37Hg 1:13 Haggai, the messenger of the Lord, spoke to the people with a special commission from the Lord£º "'I am with you,' declares the Lord."1
37Hg 1:14 Then the Lord revitalized the spirit of Shealtiel's son Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, the spirit of Jehozadak's son Joshua the high priest, and the spirit of all the rest of the people, so they came and began to work on the house of their God, the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
37Hg 1:15 This took place on the twenty-fourth day of the sixth month of the second year of the reign of King Darius.
37Hg 2:1 On the twenty-first day of the seventh month, the word of the Lord came by Haggai the prophet£º 
37Hg 2:2 "Speak to Shealtiel's son Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, to Jehozadak's son Joshua, the high priest, and to the rest of the people, asking,
37Hg 2:3 'Who is left among you who saw this house in its former glory?And what does it look like now?From what you can see, it seems like nothing, doesn't it - 
37Hg 2:4 Now be strong, Zerubbabel,' declares the Lord, 'and be strong, Joshua son of Jehozadak, the high priest, and be strong, all you people of the land,' declares the Lord. 'Go to work, because I am with you,' declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
37Hg 2:5 'My Spirit continues to dwell among you, according to the covenant I established when you came out from Egypt. Don't be afraid!
37Hg 2:6 'For this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Once more, in a little while, I will make the heavens, the earth, the sea, and the dry land to shake.
37Hg 2:7 I will shake all nations, and the One desired by all nations shall come. Then I will fill this house with glory," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
37Hg 2:8 '"The silver belongs to me, as does the gold," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
37Hg 2:9 "The glory of this present house will be greater than was the former," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. "And in this place I will grant peace," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.'
37Hg 2:10 On the twenty-fourth day of the ninth month of the second year of the reign of King Darius, the word of the Lord came to Haggai the prophet:
37Hg 2:11 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'Ask the priests about what the Law says£º 
37Hg 2:12 If a man carries consecrated meat in the folds of his garment, and if his garment touches bread, stew, wine, oil, or any other edible thing, will these things become consecrated?" The priests answered, "No."
37Hg 2:13 So Haggai responded, "If someone who is unclean because of contact with a dead body were to touch any of these things, would they become unclean? The priests responded, "They would be unclean."
37Hg 2:14 Then Haggai answered, "'That's how I look at this people and this nation,' declares the Lord. 'And that's how it is with everything they undertake and with what they offer there - it is unclean.
37Hg 2:15 "'Pay attention from now on to how things used to be before one stone had been laid upon another in the temple of the Lord.
37Hg 2:16 When someone came to a pile of grain to get twenty bushels, there were only ten. Or when someone approached the wine press to siphon out 50 measures, there were only twenty.
37Hg 2:17 I punished you and everything that you undertook - with scorching wind, with mildew, and with hail, and you still did not return to me,' declares the Lord.
37Hg 2:18 "'Pay attention from now on, from this twenty-fourth day of the ninth month, when the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid. Pay attention!
37Hg 2:19 Is there seed left in the granary?Up until now, neither the vine, the fig tree, the pomegranate, nor the olive tree has borne fruit, but from this very day I will bless you.'"
37Hg 2:20 The word of the Lord came a second time to Haggai on the twenty-fourth day of the month£º 
37Hg 2:21 "Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah. Tell him£º 'I am going to shake the heavens and the earth.
37Hg 2:22 I will overthrow royal thrones. I will annihilate the strength of national governments. I will overthrow chariots along with those who drive them. Both horses and their riders will fall, each one by means of his comrade's weapon.
37Hg 2:23 On that day,' declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, 'I will take you, my servant Zerubbabel son of Shealtiel,' declares the Lord, 'and I will set you in place like a signet ring. For I have chosen you,' declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies."

38Zch 1:1 In the eighth month of the second year of the reign of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Berekiah's son Zechariah, the grandson of Iddo the prophet:
38Zch 1:2 "The Lord was very angry with your ancestors.
38Zch 1:3 So tell them, 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Return to me," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "and I will return to you."
38Zch 1:4 "Don't be like your ancestors, to whom the former prophets proclaimed£º 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "It's time to turn from your evil lifestyles and from your evil actions,"' but they would neither listen nor pay attention to me," declares the Lord.'
38Zch 1:5 "Your ancestors - where are they?And the prophets - do they live forever - 
38Zch 1:6 But my words and my statutes that I gave as commands to my servants the prophets - did they not overwhelm your ancestors?And they returned to me£º 'The Lord of the Heavenly Armies acted toward us just as he planned to do - in keeping with our lifestyles and in keeping with our actions.'"
38Zch 1:7 On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month (the month Shebat) in the second year of the reign of Darius, the word of the Lord came to Berekiah's son Zechariah, the grandson of Iddo the prophet,
38Zch 1:8 "I stared into the night, and there was a man mounted on a red horse! The horse was standing among the myrtle trees in a ravine. Behind him there were red, brown, and white horses.
38Zch 1:9 Then I asked, "Who are these, sir? The messenger who was talking to me answered, "I will tell you who these are."
38Zch 1:10 The man who stood among the myrtle trees answered, "These are the ones whom the Lord sent out to wander throughout the earth."
38Zch 1:11 Then they reported to the angel of the Lord who stood among the myrtle trees, "We have wandered throughout the earth - and look! - the entire earth is at rest. Everything is quiet and peaceful."
38Zch 1:12 And the angel of the Lord replied, "Lord of the Heavenly Armies, how long will it be until you show mercy to Jerusalem and to the cities of Judah, with whom you have been angry for these past seventy years?
38Zch 1:13 So the Lord answered the angel who was speaking to me with kind and comforting words.
38Zch 1:14 Then the angel who was speaking to me said to me, "Announce this£º "'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "I have a deep concern for Jerusalem, a great concern for Zion.
38Zch 1:15 I am deeply angry with the nations who are complacent, with whom I was only a little displeased - but they made things worse!"
38Zch 1:16 "'Therefore this is what the Lord says£º "I have returned to Jerusalem with compassionate intentions. My temple will be rebuilt there," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "and the measuring line will be stretched out over Jerusalem."
38Zch 1:17 "Also announce the following£º "'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "My cities will again overflow with prosperity. The Lord will comfort Zion once more and will choose Jerusalem again."'"
38Zch 1:18 Then I looked up and saw four horns.
38Zch 1:19 I asked the angel who was talking to me, "What are those? So he answered me, "Those are the forces that have dispersed Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem."
38Zch 1:20 Then the Lord showed me four artisans.1
38Zch 1:21 Then I asked, "What have they come to do? He answered, "Those horns that dispersed Judah - so that no one could lift up his head - those artisans are coming to disrupt the power of nations, tearing them down now that they've come to power and dispersed the land of Judah.
38Zch 2:1 Then I looked up and saw a man with a measuring line in his hand.
38Zch 2:2 I asked, "Where are you going? He responded, "To measure Jerusalem in order to determine its width and length."
38Zch 2:3 Look! That angel who was talking to me left, and another angel came forward to meet him.
38Zch 2:4 That other angel said to him, "Run and tell that young man£º 'Jerusalem will be an inhabited city without walls due to the number of people and livestock within it.
38Zch 2:5 I myself will be an encircling rampart of fire,' declares the Lord, 'and I will be the glory in her midst.'
38Zch 2:6 "'Come now! Come now! Flee from the land of the north,' declares the Lord, 'for I have dispersed you like the four winds of heaven ,' declares the Lord. 
38Zch 2:7 "'Come now, Zion! Escape, you who are living with the residents of Babylon.
38Zch 2:8 For this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "In pursuit of glory I was sent to the nations who plundered you, because whoever injures you injures the pupil of my eye.
38Zch 2:9 And look, I will shake my fist over them, and they will become plunder for their former slaves. And you will know that the Lord of the Heavenly Armies sent me."'"
38Zch 2:10 "Sing and rejoice, daughter of Zion! Take note! I am coming to live in your midst," declares the Lord.
38Zch 2:11 "Many nations will cling to the Lord at that time and will become my people. I will live in your midst, and you will know that the Lord of the Heavenly Armies has sent me to you.
38Zch 2:12 The Lord will take possession of Judah as his own property in the Holy Land - and he will choose Jerusalem again.
38Zch 2:13 "Be silent, every living thing, in the presence of the Lord, because he is emerging from his holy place."
38Zch 3:1 Then I saw Joshua the High Priest standing in the presence of the angel of the Lord, with Satan standing at his right to oppose him.
38Zch 3:2 The Lord said to Satan, "The Lord rebuke you, Satan - in fact, may the Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! This man is a burning brand plucked from the fire, is he not?
38Zch 3:3 Now Joshua was wearing filthy clothes as he stood in the presence of the angel.
38Zch 3:4 So the angel continued to tell those who were standing in his presence, "Remove his filthy clothes." And he said to Joshua, "Look how I've removed your iniquity. Now I'm clothing you with fine garments."
38Zch 3:5 Then I said, "Let them place a pure diadem on his head." So they placed the pure diadem on his head and clothed him with fine garments while the angel of the Lord was standing beside them.
38Zch 3:6 Then the angel of the Lord gave this charge to Joshua£º 
38Zch 3:7 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'If you will live according to my ways, and if you will keep what I have entrusted to you, then you will also administer my temple, and you will also guard my courtyards. And I will give you access to these who serve here.
38Zch 3:8 "'Listen, High Priest Joshua, you and those companions of yours who sit with you, for these men are a sign that I am presenting my servant, the Branch.
38Zch 3:9 Look, the stone that I put in place in Joshua's presence - on that one stone are seven eyes. And look, I will do the engraving myself,' declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, 'and I will remove the perversity of that land in a single day.
38Zch 3:10 At that time,' declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, 'you will invite each of your neighbors to join you under the vine and fig tree.'"
38Zch 4:1 Then the angel who had been speaking with me returned and woke me up as if I had been asleep.
38Zch 4:2 Then he asked me, "What do you see? So I said, "I have been watching - and look! - there is a menorah made completely of gold with a bowl on top of it. And there are seven lights on it, along with seven feeder channels to the lamps, which are also on top of it.
38Zch 4:3 Two olive trees are near it, one on the right side of the bowl and one on the left."
38Zch 4:4 Then I asked the angel who had been speaking with me, "Sir, what are these?
38Zch 4:5 The angel who had been speaking with me answered by asking, "You don't know what these mean, do you? So I responded, "No, sir."
38Zch 4:6 Then he replied to me, "This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel£º 'Not by valor nor by strength, but only by my Spirit,' says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
38Zch 4:7 'Who are you, great mountain?You will become a plain in Zerubbabel's presence, and he will position the capstone, exulting over it, "How beautiful! How beautiful!"'"
38Zch 4:8 Then the word of the Lord came to me again£º 
38Zch 4:9 "Zerubabbel's hands have laid the foundation of this temple, and his hands will finish it, so that you will know that the Lord of the Heavenly Armies has sent me to all of you.
38Zch 4:10 For who has despised the time of insignificant things?They will rejoice to see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven lights represent the eyes of the Lord, which are looking throughout all of the earth."
38Zch 4:11 Then I asked the angel, "What are these two olive trees, one on the right of the menorah and one on the left?
38Zch 4:12 I also asked him a second question£º "What are these two olive branches on either side of the two golden feeder channels that carry the golden oil to the seven lights?
38Zch 4:13 The angel replied, "You don't know what these are, do you? I responded to him, "No, sir."
38Zch 4:14 He said, "These are the two anointed ones, who continually stand beside the Lord of the whole earth."
38Zch 5:1 Then I looked up and saw a flying scroll!
38Zch 5:2 And the angel asked me, "What do you see? I answered him, "I'm looking at a flying scroll. It's
38Zch 5:3 0 feet long and fifteen feet wide."
38Zch 5:3 He responded to me, "This is the curse that is going out over the surface of the whole earth, because, according to this side of the scroll, all thieves will be ejected, and according to the other side of the scroll, all liars will be ejected."
38Zch 5:4 "I am bringing this about," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. "The curse will enter the house of the thief and the house of the one who lies in my name. The curse will remain in his house until that house has been completely destroyed, right down to its timber and stones."
38Zch 5:5 Then the angel who had been talking with me stepped forward and said to me, "Please look up and see what's going out."5
38Zch 5:6 So I asked, "What is it? He replied, "This is a basket making its appearance." He also said, "This is what it appears to be in the entire land."
38Zch 5:7 Look, a round lead cover was being lifted, and there was one woman seated inside the basket!
38Zch 5:8 And the angel said, "This is evil!" So he shoved her back into the basket and snapped the round, lead cover over the opening.
38Zch 5:9 Then I looked up to see two women coming forward with the wind filling their wings. (They had wings like those of a stork.) They took up the basket, holding it between the earth and sky.5
38Zch 5:10 So I asked the angel who was talking to me, "Where are they taking the basket?
38Zch 5:11 He answered me, "To the land of Shinar, so they can build a temple to the woman in the basket. Then when its preparations are complete, the basket will be set there in its place."
38Zch 6:1 Then I looked up and saw four chariots coming out from between two mountains! And the mountains were made of brass!
38Zch 6:2 Attached to the first chariot were red horses. Attached to the second chariot were black horses.
38Zch 6:3 Attached to the third chariot were white horses. Attached to the fourth chariot were speckled horses and gray horses.
38Zch 6:4 In response, I asked the angel who had been talking with me, "Sir, what are these?
38Zch 6:5 The angel said to me, "These are four heavenly spirits that are going out on patrol after having presented themselves to the Lord of the whole earth.
38Zch 6:6 The black horses are headed into the north country, and the white ones are headed out after them. The speckled horses are headed toward the south country."6
38Zch 6:7 Then the gray horses went out. They were eager to go out on patrol throughout the earth, so the angel said, "Go patrol the earth." So they went out on patrol throughout the earth.
38Zch 6:8 Then he called to me, "Look! The horses that went north have caused my spirit to rest in the north country."
38Zch 6:9 Then the word of the Lord came to me£º 
38Zch 6:10 "Go take up an offering from those who came out of the Babylonian exile, that is, from Heldai, from Tobijah, and from Jedaiah. Go along with them today into the house of Zephaniah's son Josiah, who returned from Babylon.
38Zch 6:11 Take silver and gold and fashion crowns to set upon the head of Joshua son of Josedech, the High Priest.
38Zch 6:12 Then tell him, 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Here is the man whose name is The Branch. He will branch out from where he is and will rebuild the temple of the Lord.
38Zch 6:13 Yes, he will indeed rebuild the temple of the Lord, and he will exalt its majesty by sitting and ruling on his throne. He will serve as priest on his throne, and no contention will exist between them.
38Zch 6:14 The crowns will go to Helem, to Tobijah, to Jediah, and to Zephaniah's son Hen, as a memorial in the temple of the Lord.
38Zch 6:15 Those who are now far away will come and do reconstruction work in the temple of the Lord. Then you will know that the Lord of the Heavenly Armies has sent me to you. This will come about if you diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God."'"
38Zch 7:1 During the fourth year of the reign of King Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month Kislev.
38Zch 7:2 The people of Bethel were sending Sherezer, Regem-melech, and their men to pray in the Lord's presence
38Zch 7:3 and to speak to the priests assigned to the temple of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies along with the prophets, asking, "Am I to go about mourning, denying myself throughout the fifth month, as I have these many years?7
38Zch 7:4 Then the word of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies came to me£º 
38Zch 7:5 "Talk to everyone in the land, as well as to the priests. Ask them, 'When you were fasting and mourning during the fifth and seventh months for the past seventy years, were you really fasting for me - 
38Zch 7:6 And when you eat and drink, you're eating and drinking for your own benefit, aren't you - 
38Zch 7:7 Isn't this what the Lord proclaimed through the former prophets, when a prosperous Jerusalem was inhabited, as were its surrounding cities, the Negev, and the Shephelah?"
38Zch 7:8 The word of the Lord came to Zechariah again£º 
38Zch 7:9 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'Administer true justice, and show gracious love and mercy toward each other.
38Zch 7:10 You are not to wrong the widow, orphans, the foreigner, or the poor, and you are not to plan evil against each other.
38Zch 7:11 But they refused to pay attention, turned their backs, and stopped listening.
38Zch 7:12 They made their hearts hard like a diamond, to keep from obeying the Law and the messages that the Lord of the Heavenly Armies sent by his Spirit through the former prophets.
38Zch 7:13 Therefore, just as when I cried out and they would not listen, so also they will cry out, and I will not listen,' says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
38Zch 7:14 'I will scatter them to all of the nations, which they have not known.' Now the earth was left desolate after them. As a result, no one came or went because they had turned a pleasant land into a desert.
38Zch 8:1 This is the word of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies£º 
38Zch 8:2 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'I'm greatly jealous about Zion, and that makes me furious about her.'
38Zch 8:3 "This is what the Lord says£º 'I will return to Zion and I will live in the midst of Jerusalem. And Jerusalem will be called "The City of Truth" and the mountain of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies will be called "The Holy Mountain".'
38Zch 8:4 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'There will yet be old men and old women sitting in the parks of Jerusalem, each one of them holding canes in their hands due to their old age!
38Zch 8:5 The city parks will be filled with boys and girls. They will play in the city's open parks.'
38Zch 8:6 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'It may seem impossible to the survivors of this people, but is it impossible for me? declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
38Zch 8:7 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'Look! After having saved my people from the land of the east and from the land of the west,
38Zch 8:8 I will also bring them back to live in the midst of Jerusalem. They will be my people and I will truly be their righteous God."
38Zch 8:9 "This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'Be strong so the temple can be built, you who are now listening to this message spoken by the prophets when the foundation was laid to the temple of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
38Zch 8:10 Before then, everyone was unemployed - even the draft animals - and no one was safe coming or going because of the enemy, because I caused everyone to oppose each other.
38Zch 8:11 "'But now I will not treat the survivors of this people as I did formerly," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
38Zch 8:12 "For there will be a sowing of peace£º the vine will produce its fruit, the earth will produce its full yield, the sky will produce its dew, and I will make the survivors of this people inherit all these things.
38Zch 8:13 Furthermore, house of Judah and house of Israel, even though you used to be a curse among the nations, now I will surely save you, and you will be a blessing. Stop being afraid. Instead, grow stronger.'"
38Zch 8:14 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "Just as I intended to bring harm to you when your ancestors angered me," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "and I did not relent,
38Zch 8:15 so I have decided at this time to do good things for Jerusalem and for the house of Judah. So stop being afraid.
38Zch 8:16 Here's what you must do£º tell the truth to your neighbors, administer true and peaceful justice in your courtrooms,
38Zch 8:17 don't plot evil in your heart against a neighbor, and don't tolerate false testimonies, because I hate all these things," declares the Lord.
38Zch 8:18 Once again the word of the Lord come to me.
38Zch 8:19 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "The fasts that occur in the fourth, fifth, seventh, and tenth months will be joyful and glad times for the house of Judah, replete with cheerful feasts. Therefore, love truth and peace."
38Zch 8:20 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "In the future, people will come, including residents of many cities,
38Zch 8:21 and they will travel from one place to another place and say, 'Let's go quickly to pray in the presence of the Lord and to inquire of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.' And I will go, too.
38Zch 8:22 Many people and powerful nations will come to inquire of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies in Jerusalem, and to pray in the presence of the Lord."
38Zch 8:23 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "In the future, ten men speaking all the languages of the nations will grab hold of one Jewish person by the hem of his garment and say, 'Let us go up to Jerusalem with you, because we heard that God is with you.'"
38Zch 9:1 A declaration£º the word of the Lord in the land of Hadrach, with Damascus its confederate, since the eyes of all people look to the Lord, as do every tribe of Israel.
38Zch 9:2 Also Hamath, which borders on it?along with Tyre and Sidon?indeed they are very wise.
38Zch 9:3 "Tyre built itself a fortification, hoarding silver like dust and pure gold like mud in a street.
38Zch 9:4 Look! The Lord will evict her, striking at her power in the sea, and she will be consumed by fire.
38Zch 9:5 Ashkelon will see it happen and will be terrified; Gaza will tremble greatly. Ekron will be ashamed of her expectations, Gaza's king will perish, and Ashkelon will become uninhabited.
38Zch 9:6 A strange people will inhabit Ashdod, and I will eliminate the arrogance of Philistia.
38Zch 9:7 I will remove the blood from its mouth, along with its abominations from between its teeth. Its survivors will be dedicated to our God; It will be like a clan of Judah, and Ekron will be as a Jebusite.
38Zch 9:8 I will set a garrison around my temple, to hinder those who might come and go, and to guard against oppressors who intend to invade; for I have taken note of this with my eyes."
38Zch 9:9 "Rejoice greatly, daughter of Zion; cry out, daughter of Jerusalem! Look! Your king is coming to you. He is righteous, and he is able to save. He is humble, and is riding on a colt, the foal of a donkey.
38Zch 9:10 I will banish chariots from Ephraim and horses from Jerusalem. War weapons will be banished, and your king will speak peace to the nations. His dominion will extend from sea to sea, and from the River to the farthest portion of the earth.
38Zch 9:11 Now concerning you and my blood covenant with you, I have liberated your prisoners from a waterless pit.
38Zch 9:12 Return to your fortress, you prisoners who have hope. Even today I am telling you£º In return I will repay you double.
38Zch 9:13 For I have bent Judah as if it were my bow, loading it with Ephraim. I raised up your sons, Zion, against your sons, Greece, wielding you like a mighty warrior's sword.
38Zch 9:14 The Lord will appear over them?his arrow will shoot like lightning. The Lord God will blow the trumpet, and go out with the southern windstorm.
38Zch 9:15 The Lord of the Heavenly Armies will defend them; they will devour and conquer those who sling stones. They will drink and be boisterous like those who are drunk. They will be filled to the brim with blood, like the corners of the altar.
38Zch 9:16 The Lord their God will save them at that time as his very own flock of people, because they are his crown jewels, exalted throughout his land.
38Zch 9:17 For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty! Grain will make the young men thrive, and new wine the virgins.
38Zch 10:1 "Ask the Lord for rain in the spring?the Lord who fashions lightning thunderstorms, giving rain showers to mankind along with grain in the fields.
38Zch 10:2 Truly the family idols talk nonsense and the diviners discern lies, describing delusional dreams. Since their comfort is vacuous, they wander off on their own like sheep, because there is no shepherd.
38Zch 10:3 "Against the shepherds my anger rises?I am punishing the leaders also, because the Lord of the Heavenly Armies has visited his flock, the house of Judah, appointing them as his royal war horse for battle.
38Zch 10:4 From them arises the cornerstone and tent peg, from them the battle bow, from them arise all sorts of oppressive rulers.
38Zch 10:5 They will be like mighty soldiers who trample mud in the streets during battle. They will fight because the Lord is with them, and the opposing horsemen will be confused.
38Zch 10:6 "I will fortify the house of Judah, and the house of Joseph I will save. I will surely bring them back, because I care about them. They will be as if I had never cast them away. Since I am the Lord their God, I will answer them.
38Zch 10:7 "The people of Ephraim will become like mighty soldiers; they will be glad, like those who have wine. Their children will see this and rejoice; their hearts will find joy in the Lord.
38Zch 10:8 I will whistle for them, gathering them together, because I have redeemed them, and they will multiply as they were before.
38Zch 10:9 I will scatter them among the nations, and so they will remember me in distant countries. They will rear their children, and they will return.
38Zch 10:10 I will bring them once again out of the land of Egypt, gathering them from Assyria. I will bring them into the land of Gilead and Lebanon, but there will not be enough space for them.
38Zch 10:11 They will pass through the sea of affliction, and they will strike the waves in that sea. All of the depths of the Nile will evaporate, Assyria's arrogance will be brought down low, and the ruling power of Egypt will disappear.
38Zch 10:12 "I will strengthen them in the Lord, and they will march here and there in his name," declares the Lord.
38Zch 11:1 Open your doors, Lebanon, and fire will consume your cedars.
38Zch 11:2 Wail, cypress tree, for the cedar has fallen while the stately trees are destroyed. Wail, oak trees of Bashan, for the old growth forest has been cut down.
38Zch 11:3 Hear the wailing of the shepherds, for the magnificence of the forest is ruined! Hear the roar of the lions, for the Jordan's arrogance is ruined!
38Zch 11:4 This is what the Lord my God says£º "Shepherd the flock marked for slaughter.
38Zch 11:5 Their buyers slaughter them without being punished, continuing to sell them as they say, 'Bless the Lord!' and 'I'm rich!' Meanwhile, their shepherds show them no compassion.
38Zch 11:6 Therefore I will no longer show compassion upon those who live in the land," declares the Lord. Look, I will deliver every single person into the control of his neighbor and into the control of the king. Even though they assault the land, I will not deliver it from their control."
38Zch 11:7 So I became shepherd of the flock marked for slaughter, paying attention to the oppressed of the flock. I took two staffs - naming one "Pleasant" and the other one "Union" - and then I pastured the flock.
38Zch 11:8 In a single month I got rid of three shepherds because I grew tired of them, and they despised me.
38Zch 11:9 So I said, "I will no longer be your shepherd. Let those who are about to die perish, and let what is about to be destroyed be destroyed. As for the survivors, let them devour each other."
38Zch 11:10 Then I took the staff that I had named "Pleasant" and broke it, showing I was breaking my covenant that I had made with all of the people.
38Zch 11:11 It was broken at that time so the oppressed of the flock who were observing me would know that it had been the word of the Lord.
38Zch 11:12 I told them, "If it's alright with you, pay me what I've earned. But if it isn't, don't." So they paid out what I had earned - 30 shekels of silver.
38Zch 11:13 Then the Lord said to me, "Throw the money into the treasury - that magnificent value they placed on me!" So I took the shekels of silver and threw them into the treasury of the temple of the Lord.
38Zch 11:14 Then I broke my second staff - the one I had named "Union" - breaking the union between the house of Judah and the house of Israel. 
38Zch 11:15 The Lord said to me, "Pick up the tools of a worthless shepherd again,
38Zch 11:16 for I am now raising up a shepherd in the land who will neither search for the lost, nor care for the young, nor fix the broken, nor sustain the healthy. Instead, he will devour the meat of the best of the sheep, tearing off their hoofs."
38Zch 11:17 "Woe to the worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye. May his arm wither and his right eye be completely blind."
38Zch 12:1 A declaration£º the word of the Lord to Israel. The Lord, who stretches out the heavens, who lays the foundation of the earth, and who frames the spirit of man within himself, declares, 
38Zch 12:2 "Look, I am making Jerusalem an unstable cup toward all of its surrounding armies when they lay siege against Judah and Jerusalem.
38Zch 12:3 It will come about at that time that I will make Jerusalem a heavy weight; so everyone who burdens themselves with it will be crushed, even though all of the nations of the earth gather themselves against it.
38Zch 12:4 At that time," declares the Lord, "I will strike every horse with panic and every rider with insanity. I will keep my eyes on the house of Judah, but I will blind every horse of the invading armies.3
38Zch 12:5 "The leaders of Judah will say to themselves, 'Those who live in Jerusalem are my strength through the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, their God.
38Zch 12:6 At that time I will make the leaders of Judah like a brazier filled with blazing wood, or like a torch setting fire to harvested grain. They will devour all the invading armies, both on the right hand and on the left. As a result, Jerusalem will again be inhabited in its rightful place - as the real Jerusalem.
38Zch 12:7 "The Lord will deliver the tents of Judah first, so that neither the glory of the house of David nor the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem overshadows Judah.
38Zch 12:8 At that time the Lord will defend those who live in Jerusalem, and the one who is feeble among them at that time will be like David. The entire house of David will be like God - indeed, like the angel of the Lord in their midst!
38Zch 12:9 "At that time I will search out and destroy all of the nations who have come against Jerusalem.
38Zch 12:10 I will pour out on the house of David and on the residents of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and of supplications, and they will look to me?the one whom they pierced." Then they will mourn for him, as for an only son. They will grieve bitterly for him, as for a firstborn son.
38Zch 12:11 At that time Jerusalem will mourn deeply, like the mourning about Hadad-Rimmon that took place in the plain of Megiddo.
38Zch 12:12 And so the land will mourn, families by families alone by themselves?the family of the house of David by itself with their wives by themselves, the family of the house of Nathan by itself with their wives by themselves,
38Zch 12:13 the family of the house of Levi by itself with their wives by themselves, the family of Shimei by itself with their wives by themselves - 14all of the surviving families by themselves, along with their wives by themselves. 
38Zch 13:1 At that time a fountain will be opened for the house of David and for those who live in Jerusalem so they can be cleansed from sin and ceremonial impurity. "At that time," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "I will eliminate the names of the idols from the land, and they will not be remembered any more. I will also force both prophet and demon to leave the land.
38Zch 13:3 "It will also come about that if any man would dare to prophesy, then his father and his mother who bore him will respond to him, 'You will not live, because you are speaking lies in the name of the Lord.' Then his father and mother who bore him will stab him for prophesying.
38Zch 13:4 "Furthermore, it will come about at that time that every prophet will become ashamed of his vision as he prophesies. They will wear no rough garments intended to deceive others."
38Zch 13:5 "He will say, 'I am no mere prophet. A servant of mankind am I, because a man dedicated to this have I been from my youth.'
38Zch 13:6 "Someone will say to him, 'What are these injuries to your hands? "He will reply, 'They're what I received at my friend's house.'
38Zch 13:7 "Arise, sword, against my shepherd, against the mighty one who is related to me," declares the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. "Strike the shepherd, the sheep will be scattered, and I will turn against the insignificant ones.
38Zch 13:8 It will come about in all of the land," declares the Lord, "that two thirds of the people living there will die, but a third will survive who live there.
38Zch 13:9 And I will bring that surviving third through, testing them as if through fire, purifying them like silver, assaying them like gold. They will call on my name, and I will answer them. I will say, 'This is my people,' and they will say, "The Lord is my God.'"
38Zch 14:1 "Look! A day is coming for the Lord, when your plunder will be divided among you.
38Zch 14:2 I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem, to lay siege against it. The city will be captured, the houses will be ransacked, the women raped, and half of the city will go into exile, but the remaining people will not be cut off from the city.
38Zch 14:3 "Then the Lord will go out to battle against those nations, waging war as in a day of battle.
38Zch 14:4 His feet will stand in that day on the Mount of Olives, east of Jerusalem. Then the Mount of Olives will be split in two from east to west, forming a very large valley, with half of the mountain moving toward the north and half toward the south.
38Zch 14:5 "You will run away through my mountain valley, because the valley of the mountains will extend as far as Azal. You will flee, as you fled from the earthquake during the reign of King Uzziah of Judah. And so the Lord my God will come, and all his holy ones will be accompanying you."
38Zch 14:6 "At that time, the daylight will be neither bright nor overcast.
38Zch 14:7 It will be a unique day, known only to the Lord - neither daytime nor nighttime - and it will come about at twilight there will be light!
38Zch 14:8 At that time flowing waters will run perennially from Jerusalem, half toward the Dead Sea and half to the Mediterranean Sea.
38Zch 14:9 The Lord will be king over all the earth at that time. There will be one Lord, and his name the only one.
38Zch 14:10 The entire land will become like the Arabah plain from Geba to Rimmon, south of Jerusalem. It will be raised up and inhabited where it is, from the Gate of Benjamin to the First Gate, then to the Corner Gate, to the Hananeel Tower, and to the king's winepresses.
38Zch 14:11 People will live there, there will be no more destruction, and Jerusalem will be safely inhabited."
38Zch 14:12 "This will be the plague with which the Lord inflicts all of the people who have attacked Jerusalem£º he will cause their flesh to rot away, even while they're standing on their feet. He will cause their eyes to rot away in their sockets, and their tongues to rot away in their mouths.
38Zch 14:13 At that time they will be stricken with a terrible panic from the Lord. Everyone will attack each other.
38Zch 14:14 Judah, too, will fight at Jerusalem. Then the wealth of the surrounding nations will be gathered up£º gold, silver, and clothing in great abundance.
38Zch 14:15 "A similar plague will also strike horses, mules, camels, donkeys, and all of the animals in those camps."
38Zch 14:16 "It will come about that all of the survivors of the nations who came against Jerusalem will come there from year to year to worship the King, the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, and to observe the Feast of Tabernacles.
38Zch 14:17 If anyone from the families of the earth will not come to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, there will be no rain for them.
38Zch 14:18 "If the people of Egypt do not come to Jerusalem to take part, they will have no annual Nile overflow. A plague will come from the Lord to strike the nations who do not come to observe the Feast of Tabernacles.
38Zch 14:19 This will be the punishment for Egypt and all nations who do not come to observe the Feast of Tabernacles."
38Zch 14:20 "At that time there will be written on the bells of the horses£º Holiness to the Lord and the pots in the temple of the Lord will be like the bowls in front of the altar - 
38Zch 14:21 every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah will be consecrated to the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. Everyone who offers sacrifices will come, will take them, and will cook in them. Furthermore, at that time that there will no longer be a Canaanite in the LORD's temple of the Heavenly Armies."

39Mal 1:1 A declaration£º the word of the Lord to Israel by Malachi. 
39Mal 1:2 "I've loved you," says the Lord. "But you ask, 'How have you loved us? "Was not Esau Jacob's brother? declares the Lord, "yet I loved Jacob,
39Mal 1:3 rejected Esau, turned his mountains into a wasteland, and gave his inheritance to desert jackals.
39Mal 1:4 Even though Edom may claim, 'We were crushed, but we will return and rebuild the ruins,' this is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "They may rebuild, but I'll demolish. People will call them 'The Wicked Land,' and 'The People With Whom the Lord is Forever Angry.'
39Mal 1:5 Your own eyes will see this, and you will say 'Great is the Lord even beyond the borders of Israel!'"
39Mal 1:6 "A son honors his father and a servant his master. So if I'm a father, where is my honor?And if I'm a master, where is my respect? says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies to you priests who are despising my name. "But you ask, 'How have we despised your name?
39Mal 1:7 By presenting defiled food on my altar. And you ask 'How have we defiled you? By saying 'The Table of the Lord is contemptible.'
39Mal 1:8 When you bring blind animals for sacrifice, is that not wrong?And when you sacrifice crippled or diseased animals, is that not wrong?Offer that to your governor - would he be pleased with you or receive you favorably? asks the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
39Mal 1:9 "And now, go ahead and implore God by saying, 'Be gracious to us.' Will he receive you favorably and accept offerings like that from your hand? asks the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. 
39Mal 1:10 "Oh, that one of you would shut the temple doors and not light useless fires on the altar! I'm not pleased with you," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "and I'll accept no offerings from you.
39Mal 1:11 Even so, from where the sun rises to where it sets my name will be great among the Gentiles. Incense will be brought to me everywhere, along with pure offerings, because my name will be great among the Gentiles," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
39Mal 1:12 "But you are profaning my name by saying that the Table of the Lord is defiled and that its fruit and its food are contemptible.1
39Mal 1:13 "And you say 'What a burden!' and sniff contemptuously at it," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "when you present maimed, crippled, and diseased animals, and when you bring the offering. Should I accept this from your hand? asks the Lord.
39Mal 1:14 "Cursed is the deceiver who has an acceptable male in his flock, and vows to give it, but sacrifices a mutilated one to the Lord. Indeed, I am a great king," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "and my name is feared among the Gentiles." 
39Mal 2:1 "Now this commandment is for you priests£º 
39Mal 2:2 "If you don't listen, and if you don't choose to give honor to my name," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "then I'll curse both you and your blessings. I've even cursed them already, because none of you are taking it to heart.
39Mal 2:3 Look! I'm rebuking your descendants because of you, and I'll spread waste on your faces, the waste of your festival sacrifices, and you will be carried off with it.
39Mal 2:4 "You will know that I sent this commandment to you in order to continue my covenant with Levi," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
39Mal 2:5 "My covenant with him was for life and peace, and I gave the commandments to him so he would fear me. He did fear me as he stood in my presence.
39Mal 2:6 True teachings were in his mouth, and falsehood was not found on his lips. He walked with me peacefully and righteously, and he turned many from sin.
39Mal 2:7 For the lips of a priest should preserve knowledge, and people should seek instruction from his mouth, because he's the messenger of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.5
39Mal 2:8 "But you priests turned aside from the way, and by your teaching you caused many to stumble. You have violated the covenant of Levi," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
39Mal 2:9 "So I also made you despised, humiliating you before all of the people, because you aren't following my ways and are showing partiality when you teach."
39Mal 2:10 Do we not have one father?Has not one God created us?Why does each of us act deceitfully, each man against his own brother, to profane the covenant of our ancestors - 
39Mal 2:11 Judah has become unfaithful, and a detestable thing was committed in Israel and Jerusalem. Indeed, Judah profaned the Holy Place of the Lord, which he loves, and married a daughter of a foreign god.
39Mal 2:12 May the Lord exclude from the community of Jacob any man who does this, whoever he may be, even though he brings offerings to the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. 
39Mal 2:13 "This is another thing you do£º you flood the altar of the Lord with tears, weeping and wailing because he no longer pays attention to your offering nor takes pleasure in it from your hand.
39Mal 2:14 Yet you ask, 'For what reason? Because the Lord acts as a witness between you and the wife of your youth, because you were unfaithful to her, your partner, the wife of your covenant.
39Mal 2:15 Did he not make them one?And the vestige of the spirit remains in him. And why did he make them one?He was seeking godly offspring. So guard yourselves in your spirit, and don't be unfaithful to the wife of your youth.
39Mal 2:16 "Indeed, the Lord God of Israel says that he hates divorce, along with the one who conceals his violence by outward appearances," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. "So guard yourselves carefully, and don't be unfaithful."
39Mal 2:17 "You have wearied the Lord with your words. You ask, 'How have we wearied you? By your saying 'All who do evil are good in the eyes of the Lord and he's pleased with them,' or 'Where is the God of justice?"
39Mal 3:1 "Watch out! I'm sending my messenger, and he will prepare the way before me. Then suddenly the Lord you are looking for will come to his temple. He is the messenger of the covenant whom you desire. Watch out! He is coming!" says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. 
39Mal 3:2 But who will survive the day when he comes?Or who can stand when he appears?For he's like a refiner's fire and a launderer's soap.
39Mal 3:3 He will sit refining and purifying silver, purifying the descendants of Levi, refining them like gold and silver. Then they'll bring a righteous offering to the Lord.
39Mal 3:4 Then the offering to the Lord by Judah and Jerusalem will be acceptable as it was in the past, even as in former years. 
39Mal 3:5 "I'll come near to you for judgment. I'll be a witness, quick to speak against sorcerers, against adulterers, against those who swear falsely, against those who defraud the laborer of his wage, against those who defraud the widow and the orphan, against those who deprive the alien of justice, and against those who don't fear me," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
39Mal 3:6 "Because I the Lord don't change; therefore you children of Jacob, aren't destroyed."5
39Mal 3:7 "Even since the time of your ancestors you have turned away from my decrees and haven't kept them. Return to me and I'll return to you," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. "But you ask, 'How will we return?
39Mal 3:8 Will a person rob God?Yet you are robbing me! But you ask, 'How are we robbing you? By the tithe and the offering.
39Mal 3:9 You are cursed under the curse - the entire nation - because you are robbing me!" 
39Mal 3:10 "Bring the entire tithe into the storehouse that there may be food in my house. So, put me to the test in this right now," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "and see if I won't throw open the windows of heaven for you and pour out on you blessing without measure.
39Mal 3:11 And I'll prevent the devourer from harming you, so that he does not destroy the crops of your land. Nor will the vines in your fields drop their fruit," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.310
39Mal 3:12 "Then all the nations will call you blessed, for you will be a land of delight," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies. 
39Mal 3:13 "You have spoken arrogant words against me," says the Lord. "Yet you ask, 'What did we say against you?
39Mal 3:14 You said, 'It is futile to serve God,' and 'What did we get out of it when we carried out his requirements and went about like mourners in the presence of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies?
39Mal 3:15 and 'Now we call the arrogant one blessed. Those who do evil prosper and those who challenge God escape the consequences.'"
39Mal 3:16 Then those who feared the Lord talked with each other. The Lord listened and took note, and a scroll of remembrance was written in his presence about those who fear the Lord and honor His name.
39Mal 3:17 "They'll be mine," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "in the day when I prepare my treasured possession. I'll spare them, just as a man spares his own son who serves him.
39Mal 3:18 When you return, you will see the difference between the righteous and the wicked, between the one who serves God and the one who does not." 
39Mal 4:1 "Truly, the coming day is burning like a furnace. All the arrogant and all who practice evil will be stubble. The coming day will set them on fire," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, "so that it will leave them neither root nor branch.
39Mal 4:2 But the Sun of Righteousness will arise with healing in its light for those who fear my name. You will go out and leap like calves released from their stalls
39Mal 4:3 and trample down the wicked. Indeed, they will become ashes under the soles of your feet on the day I do this," says the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.1
39Mal 4:4 "Remember the law of Moses my servant that I gave him at Horeb for all Israel - both the decrees and laws.
39Mal 4:5 Pay attention! I'm sending Elijah the prophet to you before the great and dreadful Day of the Lord comes,
39Mal 4:6 and he will turn the hearts of fathers to children, and the hearts of children to their fathers. Otherwise, I'll come, strike the land, and utterly destroy it."
