01Gn 1:1 In the beginning, God created the universe. 
01Gn 1:2 When the earth was as yet unformed and desolate, with the surface of the ocean depths shrouded in darkness, and while the Spirit of God was hovering over the surface of the waters, 
01Gn 1:3 God said, "Let there be light!" So there was light.
01Gn 1:4 God saw that the light was beautiful. He separated the light from the darkness, 
01Gn 1:5 calling the light "day," and the darkness "night." The twilight and dawn were day one.
01Gn 1:6 Then God said, "Let there be a canopy between bodies of water, separating bodies of water from bodies of water!" 
01Gn 1:7 So God made a canopy that separated the water beneath the canopy from the water above it. So that's the way it was. 
01Gn 1:8 God called the canopy "sky." The twilight and the dawn were the second day.
01Gn 1:9 Then God said, "Let the water beneath the sky come together into one area, and let dry ground appear!" So that's the way it was. 
01Gn 1:10 God called the dry ground "land," and he called the water that had come together "oceans." And God saw how good it was.
01Gn 1:11 Then God said, "Let vegetation sprout all over the earth, including seed-bearing plants and fruit trees, each kind containing its own seed!" So that's the way it was£º 
01Gn 1:12 Vegetation sprouted all over the earth, including seed-bearing plants and fruit trees, each kind containing its own seed. And God saw that it was good. 
01Gn 1:13 The twilight and the dawn were the third day.
01Gn 1:14 Then God said, "Let there be lights across the sky to distinguish day from night, to act as signs for seasons, days, and years, 
01Gn 1:15 to serve as lights in the sky, and to shine on the earth!" So that's the way it was. 
01Gn 1:16 God fashioned two great lights - the larger light to shine during the day and the smaller light to shine during the night - as well as the stars. 
01Gn 1:17 God placed them in the expanse of the sky to shine on the earth, 
01Gn 1:18 to shine both day and night, and to distinguish light from darkness. And God saw how good it was. 
01Gn 1:19 The twilight and the dawn were the fourth day.1
01Gn 1:20 Then God said, "Let the oceans swarm with living creatures, and let birds fly above the earth throughout the sky!" 
01Gn 1:21 So God created every kind of magnificent marine creature, every kind of living marine crawler with which the waters swarmed, and every kind of flying bird. And God saw how good it was. 
01Gn 1:22 God blessed them by saying, "Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the oceans. Let the birds multiply throughout the earth!" 
01Gn 1:23 The twilight and the dawn were the fifth day.1
01Gn 1:24 Then God said, "Let the earth bring forth each kind of living creature, each kind of livestock and crawling thing, and each kind of wild animal!" And so it was. 
01Gn 1:25 God made each kind of wild animal, along with every kind of livestock and crawling thing. And God saw how good it was.
01Gn 1:26 Then God said, "Let us make mankind in our image, to be like us. Let them be masters over the fish in the ocean, the birds that fly, the livestock, everything that crawls on the earth, and over the earth itself!"
01Gn 1:27 So God created mankind in his own image; in his own image God created them; he created them male and female.
01Gn 1:28 God blessed these humans by saying to them, "Be fruitful, multiply, fill the earth, and subdue it! Rule over the fish in the ocean, the birds that fly, and every living thing that crawls on the earth!"
01Gn 1:29 God also told them, "Look! I have given you every seed-bearing plant that grows throughout the earth, along with every tree that grows seed-bearing fruit. They will produce your food. 
01Gn 1:30 I have given all green plants as food for every wild animal of the earth, every bird that flies, and to every living thing that crawls on the earth." And so it was.
01Gn 1:31 Now God saw all that he had made, and, indeed, it was very good! The twilight and the dawn were the sixth day.
01Gn 2:1 With this the heavens and the earth were completed, including all of their vast array. 
01Gn 2:2 By the seventh day God had completed the work he had been doing, so on the seventh day he stopped working on everything that he had done. 
01Gn 2:3 Then God blessed the seventh day and made it holy, because on it God stopped working on what he had been creating.
01Gn 2:4 These are the records of how the heavens and the earth were created. OnthedaythattheLORD God made the earth and the heavens, 
01Gn 2:5 no shrubs had yet grown in the meadows of the earth and no vegetation had sprouted, because the LORD God had not sent rain on the earth and there were no human beings to work the ground. 
01Gn 2:6 Instead, an underground stream would rise from the earth and water the surface of the ground. 
01Gn 2:7 So the LORD God formed the man from the dust of the ground, breathed life into his lungs, and the man became a living being.
01Gn 2:8 The LORD God planted a garden in Eden, toward the east, where he placed the man whom he had formed. 
01Gn 2:9 The LORD God caused every tree that is both beautiful and suitable for food to spring up out of the ground. The tree of life was also in the middle of the garden, along with the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. 
01Gn 2:10 A river flows from Eden to water the garden, and from there it divides, becoming four branches. 
01Gn 2:11 The name of the first one is Pishon - it winds through the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. 
01Gn 2:12 The gold of that land is pure; bdellium and onyx are also found there. 
01Gn 2:13 The name of the second river is Gihon; it winds through the entire land of Cush. 
01Gn 2:14 The third river is named the Tigris; it flows to the east of Assyria. The fourth river is the Euphrates.
01Gn 2:15 The LORD God took the man and placed him in the Garden of Eden in order to have him work it and guard it. 
01Gn 2:16 The LORD God commanded the man£º "You may freely eat from every tree of the garden, 
01Gn 2:17 but you must not eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, because you will certainly die during the day that you eat from it."
01Gn 2:18 Later, the LORD God said, "It is not good for the man to be alone. I will make for him a companion corresponding to him." 
01Gn 2:19 So after the LORD God formed from the ground every wild animal and every bird that flies, he brought each of them to the man to see what he would call it. Whatever the man called each living creature became its name. 
01Gn 2:20 The man gave names to all the livestock, to the birds that fly, and to every wild animal, but there was not found for the man any companion corresponding to him, 
01Gn 2:21 so the LORD God caused a deep sleep to overshadow the man.19 When the man was asleep, he removed one of the man's ribs and closed up the flesh where it had been. 
01Gn 2:22 Then the Lord God formed the rib that he had taken from the man into a woman and brought her to the man.219
01Gn 2:23 Later, the man remarked, "This at last is bone from my bones and flesh from my flesh. This one will be called 'Woman,' because she was taken from Man."
01Gn 2:24 Therefore a man will leave his father and his mother and cling to his wife, and they will become one flesh. 
01Gn 2:25 Even though both the man and his wife were naked, they were not ashamed.
01Gn 3:1 Now the serpent was more clever than any animal of the field that the LORD God had made. The serpent said to the woman, "Has God actually said, 'You are not to eat from any tree of the garden'?"
01Gn 3:2 The woman answered the serpent, "We may eat from the trees of the garden, 
01Gn 3:3 but as for the fruit of the tree that is in the middle of the garden, God has said, 'You are not to eat from it, nor are you to touch it, or you will die.'"
01Gn 3:4 Then the serpent said to the woman, "You certainly will not die! 
01Gn 3:5 Even God knows that on the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened, and you will become like God, knowing good and evil."
01Gn 3:6 When the woman saw that the tree produced good food, was attractive in appearance, and was desirable for making one wise, she took some of its fruit and ate it. Then she also gave some to her husband who was with her, and he ate some, too. 
01Gn 3:7 As a result, the eyes of both of them were opened, and they became aware that they were naked. So they sewed fig leaves together and made loincloths for themselves.
01Gn 3:8 WhentheyheardthevoiceoftheLORD God as he was walking in the garden during the breeze of the day, the man and his wife concealed themselves among the trees of the garden, hiding from the presence of the LORD God. 
01Gn 3:9 So the LORD God called out to the man, asking him, "Where are you?"
01Gn 3:10 The man answered, "I heard your voice in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked, so I hid from you."
01Gn 3:11 "Who told you that you are naked?" God asked. "Did you eat fruit from the tree that I commanded you not to eat?"
01Gn 3:12 The man answered, "The woman whom you provided for me gave me fruit from the tree, and I ate some of it."
01Gn 3:13 Then the LORD God asked the woman, "What did you do?" The woman answered, "The serpent misled me, so I ate."
01Gn 3:14 The LORD God said to the serpent, "Because you have done this, you are more cursed than all the livestock, and more than all the wild animals. You will crawl on your belly and eat dust as long as you live.
01Gn 3:15 "I will place hostility between you and the woman, between your offspring and her offspring. He will strike you on the head, and you will strike him on the heel."
01Gn 3:16 He said to the woman, "I will greatly increase the pain of your labor during childbirth; it will be painful for you to bear children. "Your trust turns toward your husband, yet he will dominate you."
01Gn 3:17 He said to the man, "Because you have listened to what your wife said, and have eaten from the tree about which I commanded you, 'You must not eat from it,' cursed is the ground because of you. You will eat from it through pain-filled labor for the rest of your life.
01Gn 3:18 It will produce thorns and thistles for you, and you will eat the plants from the meadows.
01Gn 3:19 You will eat food by the sweat of your brow until you are buried in the ground, because you were taken from it. You are made from dust and you will return to dust."3
01Gn 3:20 Now Adam had named his wife "Eve," because she was to become the mother of everyone who was living. 
01Gn 3:21 The LORD God fashioned garments from animal skins for Adam and his wife, and clothed them.320
01Gn 3:22 Later, the LORD God said, "See, the man has become like one of us in knowing good and evil. Now, so he won't reach out, also take from the tree of life, eat, and then live forever?" 
01Gn 3:23 therefore the LORD God expelled the man from the garden of Eden so he would work the ground from which he had been taken. 
01Gn 3:24 After he had expelled the man, the LORD God placed winged angels at the eastern end of the garden of Eden, along with a fiery whirling sword, to prevent access to the tree of life.3
01Gn 4:1 Later, Adam had sexual relations with his wife Eve. She became pregnant and gave birth to Cain. She said, "I have given birth to a male child with the LORD." 
01Gn 4:2 She also gave birth to his brother Abel. Abel shepherded flocks and Cain became a farmer.
01Gn 4:3 Later, Cain brought an offering to the LORD from the fruit that he had harvested, 
01Gn 4:4 while Abel offered the best parts of some of the firstborn from his flock. The LORD looked favorably upon Abel and his offering, 
01Gn 4:5 but he did not look favorably upon Cain and his offering. When Cain became very upset and depressed, 
01Gn 4:6 the LORD asked Cain, "Why are you so upset -  Why are you downcast -  
01Gn 4:7 If you do what is appropriate, you'll be accepted, won't you -  But if you don't do what is appropriate, sin is crouching near your doorway, turning toward you. However, you must take dominion over it."
01Gn 4:8 Instead, Cain told his brother Abel, "Let's go out to the wilderness." When they were outside in the fields, Cain attacked his brother Abel and killed him.
01Gn 4:9 Later, the LORD asked Cain, "Where is your brother Abel?" "I don't know," he answered." Am I my brother's guardian?"
01Gn 4:10 "What did you do?" God asked. "Your brother's blood cries out to me from the ground. 
01Gn 4:11 Now you are more cursed than the ground, which has opened to receive your brother's blood from your hand. 
01Gn 4:12 Whenever you work the ground, it will no longer yield its produce to you, and you will wander throughout the earth as a fugitive."
01Gn 4:13 "My punishment is too great to bear," Cain said to the LORD. 
01Gn 4:14 "You're driving me from the soil today. I'll be hidden from you, and I'll wander throughout the earth as a fugitive. In the future, whoever finds me will kill me."
01Gn 4:15 The LORD said to him, "This won't happen, because whoever kills you will suffer seven times the vengeance." Then the LORD placed a sign on Cain so that no one finding him would kill him. 
01Gn 4:16 After this, Cain left the presence of the LORD and settled in the land of Nod, east of Eden.
01Gn 4:17 Later, Cain had sexual relations with his wife. She became pregnant and gave birth to Enoch. Cain founded a city and named it after his son Enoch. 
01Gn 4:18 Irad was born to Enoch. Irad fathered Mehujael, and Mehujael fathered Methushael, and Methushael fathered Lamech. 
01Gn 4:19 Later, Lamech married two wives. One was named Adah and the other was named Zillah. 
01Gn 4:20 Adah gave birth to Jabal, who became the ancestor of those who live in tents and herd livestock. 
01Gn 4:21 His brother was named Jubal; he became the ancestor of all those who play the lyre and the flute. 
01Gn 4:22 Zillah gave birth to Tubal-cain, who became a forger of bronze and iron work. Tubal-cain's sister was Naamah. 
01Gn 4:23 Lamech told his wives, "Adah and Zillah, listen to what I have to say£º You wives of Lamech, hear what I'm announcing! I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for bruising me.
01Gn 4:24 For if Cain is being avenged seven times, then Lamech will be avenged 77 times."
01Gn 4:25 Later on, after Adam had sexual relations with his wife, she gave birth to a son and named him Seth, because "God granted me another offspring to replace Abel, since Cain killed him."
01Gn 4:26 Seth also fathered a son, whom he named Enosh. At that time people began to call upon the name of the LORD.
01Gn 5:1 This is the historical record of Adam's generations. On the day that God created mankind, he made them in the likeness of God.
01Gn 5:2 Creating them male and female, he blessed them and called them humans when he created them.
01Gn 5:3 After Adam had lived 130 years, he fathered a son just like him, that is, according to his image, and named him Seth. 
01Gn 5:4 Adam lived another 800 years, fathering other sons and daughters after he had fathered Seth. 
01Gn 5:5 Adam lived a total of 930 years and then died.
01Gn 5:6 When Seth had lived 105 years, he fathered Enosh. 
01Gn 5:7 After he fathered Enosh, Seth lived 807 years, fathering other sons and daughters. 
01Gn 5:8 Seth lived a total of 912 years and then died.
01Gn 5:9 When Enosh had lived 90 years, he fathered Kenan. 
01Gn 5:10 After he fathered Kenan, Enosh lived 815 years, fathering other sons and daughters. 
01Gn 5:11 Enosh lived a total of 905 years and then died.
01Gn 5:12 When Kenan had lived 70 years, he fathered Mahalalel. 
01Gn 5:13 After he fathered Mahalalel, Kenan lived 840 years, fathering other sons and daughters. 
01Gn 5:14 Kenan lived a total of 910 years and then died.
01Gn 5:15 When Mahalalel had lived 65 years, he fathered Jared. 
01Gn 5:16 After he fathered Jared, Mahalalel lived 830 years, fathering other sons and daughters. 
01Gn 5:17 Mahalalel lived a total of 895 years and then died.
01Gn 5:18 When Jared had lived 162 years, he fathered Enoch. 
01Gn 5:19 After he fathered Enoch, Jared lived 800 years, fathering other sons and daughters. 
01Gn 5:20 Jared lived a total of 962 years and then died.
01Gn 5:21 When Enoch had lived 65 years, he fathered Methuselah. 
01Gn 5:22 After he fathered Methuselah, Enoch communed with God for 300 years and fathered other sons and daughters. 
01Gn 5:23 Enoch lived a total of 365 years, 
01Gn 5:24 communing with God - and then he was there no more, because God had taken him.
01Gn 5:25 When Methuselah had lived 187 years, he fathered Lamech. 
01Gn 5:26 After he fathered Lamech, Methuselah lived 782 years, fathering other sons and daughters. 
01Gn 5:27 Methuselah lived a total of 969 years and then died.
01Gn 5:28 When Lamech had lived 182 years, he fathered a son, 
01Gn 5:29 whom he named Noah, because he said, "May this one comfort us from our work, from pain that is caused by our manual labor, and from the ground that the LORD has cursed." 
01Gn 5:30 After he fathered Noah, Lamech lived 595 years, fathering other sons and daughters. 
01Gn 5:31 Lamech lived a total of 777 years and then died.
01Gn 5:32 After Noah had lived 500 years, he fathered Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
01Gn 6:1 Now after human beings had increased in numbers throughout the earth and daughters had been born to them, 
01Gn 6:2 some divine beings noticed how attractive human women were, so they took wives for themselves from a selection that pleased them.
01Gn 6:3 Then the LORD said, "My Spirit will not remain with human beings forever, because they are truly mortal. Their lifespan will be 120 years." 
01Gn 6:4 The Nephilim were on the earth in those days. Soon after, divine beings cohabited with human women, who gave birth to children for them. These children became the heroes of ancient times, men of renown.
01Gn 6:5 The LORD saw that human evil had grown significantly throughout the earth. Every inclination of people's thoughts was only evil on a continuous basis. 
01Gn 6:6 Then the LORD regretted that he had made human beings on the earth, and he was deeply grieved about that. 
01Gn 6:7 So the LORD said, "I will annihilate these human beings whom I've created from the earth, whether people, or animals, or crawling things, or flying birds, because I'm grieving that I made them."
01Gn 6:8 Noah, however, received favor in the sight of the LORD.
01Gn 6:9 These are the family records of Noah£º Noah was a righteous man. Blameless during his lifetime, Noah communed with God. 
01Gn 6:10 Noah fathered three sons£º Shem, Ham, and Japheth.
01Gn 6:11 By this time, the earth had become ruined in God's opinion and filled with violence. 
01Gn 6:12 God looked at the earth, observing how corrupt its population had become, because the entire human race had corrupted itself. 
01Gn 6:13 So God announced to Noah, "I've decided to destroy every living thing on earth, because it has become filled with violence through them. Look! I'm about to annihilate them, along with the earth. 
01Gn 6:14 So make yourself an ark out of cedar, constructing compartments in it, and cover it inside and out with tar. 
01Gn 6:15 Make the ark like this£º 450 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet high. 
01Gn 6:16 Make a roof for the ark, and finish the walls to within one and a half feet from the top. Place the entrance in the side of the ark, and build a lower, a middle, and an upper deck. 614
01Gn 6:17 "For my part, I'm about to flood the earth with water and destroy every living thing that breathes. Everything on earth will die. 
01Gn 6:18 However, I will establish my own covenant with you, and you are to enter the ark - you, your sons, your wife, and your sons' wives. 
01Gn 6:19 You are to bring two of every living thing into the ark so they may remain alive with you. They are to be male and female. 
01Gn 6:20 From birds after their kind, from domestic animals after their kind, and from everything that crawls on the ground after their kind - two of everything will come to you so they may remain alive. 
01Gn 6:21 For your part, take some of the edible food and store it away - these stores will be food for you and the animals."
01Gn 6:22 Noah did all of this, precisely as God had commanded.
01Gn 7:1 gen 7:1Then the LORD said to Noah, "Come - you and all your household - into the ark, because I've seen that you alone are righteous in this generation. 
01Gn 7:2 You are to take with you seven pairs of every clean animal, a male and its mate, and two of the unclean animals, a male and its mate; 
01Gn 7:3 along with seven pairs of the flying birds, male and female, in order to keep their offspring alive on the surface of all the earth. 
01Gn 7:4 Seven days from now I'll send rain on the earth for 40 days and 40 nights, and I'll destroy every living creature that I've made."
01Gn 7:5 Noah did everything that the LORD commanded.
01Gn 7:6 Noah was 600 years old when water began to flood the earth. 
01Gn 7:7 Noah, his sons, his wife, and his sons' wives entered the ark with him before the flood waters arrived. 
01Gn 7:8 From both clean and unclean animals, from birds, and from everything that crawls on the ground, 
01Gn 7:9 two by two, male and female, they entered the ark to join Noah, just as God had commanded.
01Gn 7:10 Seven days later, the flooding started. 
01Gn 7:11 On the seventeenth day of the second month, when Noah was 600 years old, all the springs of the great deep burst open, the floodgates of the heavens were opened, 
01Gn 7:12 and it rained throughout the earth for 40 days and 40 nights. 
01Gn 7:13 On that very day, Noah entered the ark with his sons Shem, Ham, and Japheth, Noah's wife, his sons' three wives with them, 
01Gn 7:14 every kind of wild animal, livestock, crawling creature, bird, and every creature that has wings. 
01Gn 7:15 Two of each living creature entered the ark with Noah. 
01Gn 7:16 The males and females of each living creature entered the ark in accordance with God's command. Then the Lord shut them inside.
01Gn 7:17 The flood continued throughout the earth for 40 days, while the flood waters increased, lifting the ark so that it rose above the surface of the earth. 
01Gn 7:18 The flood waters continued to surge, increasing throughout the earth, while the ark floated on the surface of the flood water. 
01Gn 7:19 The flood water surged even higher throughout the earth, until all the highest mountains under the sky were covered. 
01Gn 7:20 The flood waters rose 22 and a half feet above the mountains. 
01Gn 7:21 Every living thing on earth perished - birds, livestock, wildlife, all creatures that swarm over the earth, and all human beings. 
01Gn 7:22 Everything that breathed and everything that lived on dry land died. 
01Gn 7:23 All existing creatures that lived on the surface of the ground were annihilated, from humans to livestock, from crawling creatures to birds of the sky. They were wiped off the earth. Only Noah remained, along with those who were with him in the ark. 
01Gn 7:24 The flood waters surged over the earth for 150 days.
01Gn 8:1 God kept Noah in mind, along with all the wildlife and livestock that were with him in the ark. God's Spirit moved throughout the earth, causing the flood waters to subside. 
01Gn 8:2 The water sources from the deep were blocked and the floodgates of the heavens were closed. 
01Gn 8:3 Then the flood waters steadily receded from the dry land, diminishing completely by the end of the 150 days.
01Gn 8:4 The ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat on the seventeenth day of the seventh month. 
01Gn 8:5 The flood water continued to decrease until the tenth month, when, on the first of that month, the tops of the mountains could be seen.
01Gn 8:6 After 40 days, Noah opened the window of the ark that he had built 
01Gn 8:7 and sent out a raven. It went back and forth as the flood water continued to evaporate throughout the earth. 
01Gn 8:8 Later, he sent a dove out from the ark to see whether the water that covered the land's surface had completely decreased, 
01Gn 8:9 but the dove could not yet find a place to rest, so it returned to Noah on the ark, since water still covered the land. Noah reached out his hand and took the dove back into the ark with him.88
01Gn 8:10 Noah waited another seven days and sent the dove out from the ark again. 11At evening the dove returned to him, and there was a plucked olive leaf in its beak! So Noah knew that the flood waters had decreased on the land. 
01Gn 8:12 He waited seven more days and sent the dove out again, but it did not return to him anymore.
01Gn 8:13 In the six hundred and first year of Noah's life, during the first month, the flood water began to evaporate from the land. Noah then removed the ark's cover and saw that the surface of the land was drying. 
01Gn 8:14 By the twenty seventh day of the second month, the ground was dry.
01Gn 8:15 God spoke to Noah, 
01Gn 8:16 "It's time for you, your wife, your sons, and your sons' wives who are with you to leave the ark. 
01Gn 8:17 Bring out with you every living creature - including the birds, animals, and everything that crawls on the ground - so they may disperse throughout the land, be fruitful, and multiply throughout the earth."
01Gn 8:18 So Noah, his sons, his wife, and his son's wives emerged. 
01Gn 8:19 Every animal, every crawling thing, every bird, and everything that moves on the earth emerged from the ark by groups.
01Gn 8:20 Then Noah built an altar to the Lord and offered burnt offerings on it from every clean animal and every clean bird. 
01Gn 8:21 When the Lord smelled the pleasing aroma, he said to himself, "I will never again curse the land because of human beings - even though the human inclination remains evil from youth - nor will I destroy every living being ever again, as I have done.
01Gn 8:22 Never again, as long as the earth exists, will sowing and harvest, cold and heat, summer and winter, and day and night ever cease."
01Gn 9:1 God blessed Noah and his sons and ordered them, "Be productive, multiply, and fill the earth. 
01Gn 9:2 All the living creatures of the earth will be filled with fear and terror of you from now on, including all the birds of the sky, everything that crawls on the ground, and all the fish of the ocean. They have been assigned to live under your dominion.
01Gn 9:3 Every living, moving creature will be food for you. Just as I gave you green plants before, so now you have everything. 
01Gn 9:4 However, you are not to eat meat with its life - that is, its blood - in it! 
01Gn 9:5 Also, I will surely demand an accounting in regards to your lifeblood, from every animal and from every human being. I will demand an accounting from every human being for the life of another human being.
01Gn 9:6 Whoever sheds human blood, by a human his own blood is to be shed; because God made human beings in his own image.
01Gn 9:7 Now as for you, be productive and multiply; spread out over the land and multiply on it."
01Gn 9:8 Later, God told Noah and his sons, 
01Gn 9:9 "Pay attention! I'm establishing my covenant with you and with your descendants after you, 
01Gn 9:10 and with every living creature that is with you - the birds, the livestock, and all the wildlife of the earth that are with you - all the earth's animals that came out of the ark. 
01Gn 9:11 I will establish my covenant with you£º No living beings will ever be cut off again by flood waters, and there will never again be a flood that destroys the earth."
01Gn 9:12 God also said, "Here's the symbol that represents the covenant that I'm making between me and you and every living being with you, for all future generations£º 
01Gn 9:13 I've set my rainbow in the clouds to symbolize the covenant between me and the earth. 
01Gn 9:14 Whenever I bring clouds over the earth and the rainbow becomes visible in the clouds, 
01Gn 9:15 I'll remember my covenant between me and you and every living creature, so that water will never again become a flood to destroy all living beings. 
01Gn 9:16 When the rainbow is in the clouds, I will observe it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all living beings - all flesh on the earth."
01Gn 9:17 God also said to Noah, "This is the symbol of the covenant that I've established between me and every thing that lives on the earth." 
01Gn 9:18 Noah's sons who came out of the ark were Shem, Ham, and Japheth. (Ham later fathered Canaan.) 
01Gn 9:19 These three were Noah's sons, and from these the whole earth was re-populated.
01Gn 9:20 Noah, a man of the soil, was the first to plant and farm a vineyard. 
01Gn 9:21 He drank some of the wine, got drunk, and lay down naked right in the middle of his tent. 
01Gn 9:22 Ham, who fathered Canaan, saw his father's genitals and told his two brothers outside. 
01Gn 9:23 Then Shem and Japheth took their father's cloak, laid it across both their shoulders, and walking backwards, they both covered their father's genitals. Their faces were turned away, and they did not see their father's genitals. 
01Gn 9:24 When Noah woke from his wine stupor and learned what his youngest son had done to him, 
01Gn 9:25 he said,92Canaan is cursed! He will be the lowest of slaves to his relatives."
01Gn 9:26 He also said, "Blessed be the Lord God of Shem, and may Canaan be his slave.
01Gn 9:27 May God make room for Japheth; may God live in Shem's tents, and may Canaan serve him.
01Gn 9:28 Noah lived 350 years after the flood. 
01Gn 9:29 After Noah had lived a total of 950 years, he died.
01Gn 10:1 These are the records of Noah's sons, Shem, Ham and Japheth, to whom descendants were born after the flood. 
01Gn 10:2 Japheth's descendants included Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras.
01Gn 10:3 Gomer's descendants included Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah.
01Gn 10:4 Javan's descendants included Elisha, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim, 
01Gn 10:5 from whom the coastal peoples spread into their own lands and nations, each with their own language and family groups.
01Gn 10:6 Ham's descendants included Cush, Egypt, Put, and Canaan.
01Gn 10:7 Cush's descendants included Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca. Raamah's descendants included Sheba and Dedan.
01Gn 10:8 Cush fathered Nimrod, who became the first fearless leader throughout the land. 
01Gn 10:9 He became a fearless hunter before the Lord. That is why it is said, "Like Nimrod, a fearless hunter before the Lord." 
01Gn 10:10 His kingdom began in the region of Shinar with the cities of Babylon, Erech, Akkad, and Calneh. 
01Gn 10:11 From there he went north to Assyria and built Nineveh, Rehoboth-ir, Calah, 
01Gn 10:12 along with Resen, which was located between Nineveh and the great city of Calah.
01Gn 10:13 Egypt fathered the Ludites, the Anamites, the Lehabites, the Naphtuhites,
01Gn 10:14 the Pathrusites, the Casluhites (from which came the Philistines), and the Caphtorites.
01Gn 10:15 Canaan fathered Sidon his firstborn, along with the Hittites, 
01Gn 10:16 the Jebusites, the Amorites, the Girgashites, 
01Gn 10:17 the Hivites, the Arkites, the Sinites, 
01Gn 10:18 the Arvadites, the Zemarites, and the Hamathites. Later, the Canaanite families were widely scattered. 
01Gn 10:19 The Canaanite border extended south from Sidon toward Gerar as far as Gaza, and east toward Sodom, Gomorrah, Adinah, and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha.
01Gn 10:20 These are Ham's descendants, listed by their families, each with their own lands, language, and family groups.
01Gn 10:21 Shem, Japheth's older brother, also had descendents. Shem was the father of the descendents of Eber. 
01Gn 10:22 Shem's sons included Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud, and Aram.
01Gn 10:23 Aram's descendants included Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash.
01Gn 10:24 Arpachshad fathered Cainan, Cainan fathered Shelah, and Shelah fathered Eber. 
01Gn 10:25 To Eber were born two sons. One was named Peleg, because the earth was divided during his lifetime. His brother was named Joktan.
01Gn 10:26 Joktan fathered Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 
01Gn 10:27 Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 
01Gn 10:28 Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 
01Gn 10:29 Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab. All these were Joktan's descendants. 
01Gn 10:30 Their settlements extended from Mesha towards Sephar, the eastern hill country. 
01Gn 10:31 These are Shem's descendants, listed by their families, each with their own lands, language, and family groups. 
01Gn 10:32 These are the families of Noah's sons, according to their records, in their nations. From these, the nations on the earth spread out after the flood.
01Gn 11:1 There was a time when the entire earth spoke a common language with an identical vocabulary. 
01Gn 11:2 As people migrated westward, they came across a plain in the region of Shinar and settled there. 
01Gn 11:3 They said to each other, "Come on! Let's burn bricks thoroughly." They used bricks for stone and tar for mortar. 
01Gn 11:4 Then they said, "Come on! Let's build ourselves a city and a tower, with its summit in the heavens, and let's make a name for ourselves so we won't be scattered over the surface of the whole earth."
01Gn 11:5 However, the Lord descended to look over the city and the tower that the humans were building. 
01Gn 11:6 The Lord said, "Look! They are one people with the same language for all of them, and this is only the beginning of what they will do. Nothing that they have a mind to do will be impossible for them! 
01Gn 11:7 Come on! Let's go down there and confuse their language, so that they will not understand each other's speech."6
01Gn 11:8 So the Lord scattered them abroad from there over the surface of the whole earth, so that they had to stop building the city. 
01Gn 11:9 Therefore it was called Babylon, because there the Lord confused the language of all the earth, and from there the Lord scattered them over the surface of the entire earth.
01Gn 11:10 These are the family records of Shem. When Shem had lived 100 years, he fathered Arpachshad two years after the flood. 
01Gn 11:11 Shem lived 500 years after he fathered Arpachshad and had other sons and daughters. 
01Gn 11:12 When Arpachshad had lived 35 years, he fathered Cainan. 
01Gn 11:13 After he fathered Cainan, Arpachshad lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters, and then died. Cainan lived 130 years and fathered Shelah. After he fathered Shelah, Cainan lived 330 years and had other sons and daughters, and then died.
01Gn 11:14 When Shelah had lived 30 years, he fathered Eber. 
01Gn 11:15 After he fathered Eber, Shelah lived 403 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:16 When Eber had lived 34 years, he fathered Peleg. 
01Gn 11:17 After he fathered Peleg, Eber lived 430 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:18 When Peleg had lived 30 years, he fathered Reu. 
01Gn 11:19 After he fathered Reu, Peleg lived 209 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:20 When Reu had lived 32 years, he fathered Serug. 
01Gn 11:21 After he fathered Serug, Reu lived 207 years and had other sons and daughters. 
01Gn 11:22 When Serug had lived 30 years, he fathered Nahor. 
01Gn 11:23 After he fathered Nahor, Serug lived 200 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:24 When Nahor had lived 29 years, he fathered Terah. 
01Gn 11:25 After he fathered Terah, Nahor lived 119 years and had other sons and daughters.
01Gn 11:26 When Terah had lived 70 years, he fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran.
01Gn 11:27 Now these are the family records of Terah£º Terah fathered Abram, Nahor, and Haran; and Haran fathered Lot. 
01Gn 11:28 Haran died during his father's lifetime in the land of his birth, that is, in Ur of the Chaldeans.
01Gn 11:29 Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram's wife was Sarai, and the name of Nahor's wife was Milcah. She was the daughter of Haran, who was the father of Milcah and Iscah. 
01Gn 11:30 Sarah was barren; she had not yet borne children.
01Gn 11:31 Terah took his son Abram, his grandson Lot (Haran's son), and his daughter-in-law Sarai, his son Abram's wife, and they journeyed together from Ur of the Chaldeans to go to the land of Canaan. But when they came as far as Haran, they settled there. 
01Gn 11:32 Terah lived for 205 years, and then died in Haran.
01Gn 12:1 The Lord spoke to Abram, "You are to leave your land, your relatives, and your father's house and go to the land that I'll show you. 
01Gn 12:2 I'll develop you into a great nation, I'll bless you, and I'll make your reputation great, so that you will be a blessing. 
01Gn 12:3 I'll bless those who bless you, but I'll curse the one who curses you, and through you all the people of the earth will be blessed."
01Gn 12:4 So Abram went out, as the Lord had spoken to him, and Lot accompanied him. Abram was 75 years old when he left Haran. 
01Gn 12:5 Abram took his wife Sarai, his nephew Lot, all the possessions they had accumulated, and the servants he had acquired while living in Haran. Then they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they arrived in the land of Canaan, 
01Gn 12:6 Abram traveled through the land to the place called Shechem, as far as the oak of Moreh. At that time the Canaanites were in the land.
01Gn 12:7 Then the Lord appeared to Abram and said, "I'll give this land to your descendants." So Abram built an altar to the Lord, who had appeared to him. 
01Gn 12:8 From there Abram traveled on to the hill country east of Bethel and set up his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east. There he built an altar to the Lord and called on the name of the Lord. 
01Gn 12:9 Then Abram traveled on, continuing on into the Negev.
01Gn 12:10 There was a famine in the land, so Abram went down to Egypt to live because the famine was so severe. 
01Gn 12:11 When he was about to enter Egypt, he said to his wife Sarai, "Look, I'm aware that you're a beautiful woman. 
01Gn 12:12 When the Egyptians see you, they will say, 'She is his wife.' Then they'll kill me, but allow you to live. 
01Gn 12:13 Please say that you are my sister, so things will go well for me for your sake. That way, you'll be saving my life."1211
01Gn 12:14 As Abram was entering Egypt, the Egyptians noticed how beautiful Sarai was. 
01Gn 12:15 When Pharaoh's officials saw her, they brought her to the attention of Pharaoh and took the woman to Pharaoh's palace. 
01Gn 12:16 He treated Abram well because of her, so he acquired sheep, oxen, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels. 
01Gn 12:17 But the Lord afflicted Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of Sarai, Abram's wife. 
01Gn 12:18 Pharaoh summoned Abram and asked, "What have you done to me! Why didn't you tell me that she was your wife -  
01Gn 12:19 Why did you say, 'She is my sister,' so that I took her as a wife for myself -  Now, here is your wife! Take her and get out!"1216
01Gn 12:20 So Pharaoh assigned men to Abram, and they escorted him, his wife, and all that he had out of the country.
01Gn 13:1 Abram traveled from Egypt, along with his wife and everyone who pertained to him, including Lot, to the Negev.
01Gn 13:2 Now Abram had become quite wealthy in livestock, silver, and gold. 
01Gn 13:3 He journeyed by stages from the Negev to Bethel, the place where his tent had formerly been, between Bethel and Ai, 
01Gn 13:4 where he had first built an altar. There Abram called on the name of the Lord.
01Gn 13:5 Lot, who was traveling with Abram, also had flocks of sheep, other herds, and tents. 
01Gn 13:6 But the land could not support them living together, because they had so many possessions that they could not stay together. 
01Gn 13:7 There was strife between the herdsmen in charge of Abram's livestock and the herdsmen in charge of Lot's livestock. Also, at that time the Canaanites and the Perizzites were living in the land.
01Gn 13:8 So Abram said to Lot, "Please, let's not have strife between you and me, or between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, since we are relatives. 
01Gn 13:9 Isn't the whole land before you -  Let's separate£º If you go to the left, then I will go to the right; if you go to the right, then I will go to the left."
01Gn 13:10 Lot looked around and noticed that the whole Jordan plain as far as Zoar was well-watered like the garden of the Lord or like the land of Egypt. (This was before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah.) 
01Gn 13:11 So Lot chose for himself all the Jordan plain. Then Lot traveled eastward, and they separated from each other.
01Gn 13:12 So Abram lived in the land of Canaan, while Lot settled in the cities of the plain, setting up his tent in the vicinity of Sodom. 
01Gn 13:13 Now the men of Sodom were very evil and sinful in defiance of the Lord.
01Gn 13:14 After Lot had separated from Abram, the Lord said to Abram, "Look out from where you're living - to the north, south, east, and west, 
01Gn 13:15 because I'm going to give you and your descendants all of the land that you see forever. 
01Gn 13:16 I'll make your descendants as numerous as the dust of the earth, so that if one could count the dust of the earth, then your descendants could be counted. 
01Gn 13:17 Get up! Walk throughout the length and breadth of the land, because I'm going to give it to you."
01Gn 13:18 So Abram moved his tent and settled beside the oaks of Mamre that are by Hebron, where he built an altar to the Lord.
01Gn 14:1 At the time when Amrafel was king of Shinar, Arioch was king of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer was king of Elam, and Tidal was king of the Goiim, 
01Gn 14:2 they engaged in war against King Bera of Sodom, King Birsha of Gomorrah, King Shinab of Admah, King Shemeber of Zeboiim, along with the king of Bela (which was also known as Zaor). 
01Gn 14:3 All of this latter group of kings allied together in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Salt Sea). 
01Gn 14:4 They were subject to Chedorlaomer for twelve years, but they rebelled in the thirteenth year.
01Gn 14:5 In the fourteenth year, Chedorlaomer and the kings with him came and defeated the Rephaites in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzites in Ham, the Emites in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 
01Gn 14:6 and the Horites in the hill country of Seir, near El-paran by the desert. 
01Gn 14:7 Next they turned back and came to En-mishpat (which was also known as Kadesh) and conquered all the territory of the Amalekites, along with the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar.
01Gn 14:8 Then the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (which was also known as Zoar) prepared for battle in the Valley of Siddim 
01Gn 14:9 against King Chedorlaomer of Elam, King Tidal of Goiim, King Amraphel of Shinar, and King Arioch of Ellasar - four kings against five. 
01Gn 14:10 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar pits, so when the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, some of their people fell into them, while the rest fled to the hill country. 
01Gn 14:11 The conquerors captured all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah, including their entire food supply, and then left. 
01Gn 14:12 They also took Abram's nephew Lot and his possessions, since he was living in Sodom.
01Gn 14:13 Someone escaped, arrived, and reported what had happened to Abram the Hebrew, who was living by the oaks of Mamre the Amorite, whose brothers Eshcol and Aner were allied with Abram. 
01Gn 14:14 When Abram heard that his nephew had been taken prisoner, he gathered together 318 of his trained men, who had been born in his household, and they went out in pursuit as far as Dan. 
01Gn 14:15 During the night Abram and his servants divided his forces, conquered them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, north of Damascus. 
01Gn 14:16 He recovered all the goods and brought back his nephew Lot, together with his possessions, the women, and the other people.1415
01Gn 14:17 After Abram's return from defeating Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with them, the king of Sodom went out to meet with him in the Shaveh Valley (that is, the King's Valley). 
01Gn 14:18 King Melchizedek of Salem brought out bread and wine, since he was priest of God Most High. 
01Gn 14:19 Melchizedek blessed Abram and said, "Abram is blessed by God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth,
01Gn 14:20 and blessed be God Most High, who has delivered your enemies into your control." Then Abram gave him a tenth of everything.
01Gn 14:21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, "Give me the people, and you take the possessions for yourself."
01Gn 14:22 But Abram answered the king of Sodom, "I have made an oath to the Lord God Most High, Creator of heaven and earth, 
01Gn 14:23 that I will not take a thread or a sandal strap or anything that belongs to you, so you won't be able to say, 'I have made Abram rich.' 
01Gn 14:24 I will take nothing except what my warriors have eaten. But as for the share of the men who were allied with me, including Aner, Eshcol and Mamre, let them take their share."
01Gn 15:1 Some time later a message came from the Lord to Abram in a vision£º "Don't be afraid, Abram. I am your shield; your reward will be very great."
01Gn 15:2 But Abram replied, "Lord God, what can you give me since I continue to be childless, and the heir of my household is Eliezer from Damascus -  
01Gn 15:3 Look!" Abram said, "You haven't given me any offspring, so a servant born in my house is going to be my heir."
01Gn 15:4 A message came from the Lord to him again£º "This one will not be your heir. Instead, the one who comes from your body will be your heir." 
01Gn 15:5 Then the Lord brought him outside. "Look up at the sky and count the stars - if you can!" he said. "Your descendants will be that numerous." 
01Gn 15:6 Abram believed the Lord, and it was credited to him as righteousness.
01Gn 15:7 The Lord spoke to him, "I am the Lord, who brought you from Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land as an inheritance."
01Gn 15:8 But he replied, "Lord God, how will I know that I will inherit it?" 
01Gn 15:9 The Lord responded, "Bring me a three year old cow, a three year old female goat, a three year old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon."
01Gn 15:10 So Abram brought him all these animals and cut each of them in half, down the middle, placing the pieces opposite each other, but he did not cut the birds in half. 
01Gn 15:11 When birds of prey swooped down on the carcasses, Abram drove them away. 
01Gn 15:12 As the sun began to set, a deep sleep came over Abram, and suddenly a frightening and terrifying darkness descended on him.
01Gn 15:13 Then the Lord said to Abram, "You can be certain about this£º Your descendants will be foreigners in a land that isn't theirs. They will be slaves there and will be oppressed for 400 years. 
01Gn 15:14 However, I will judge the nation that they serve, and later they will come out with many possessions. 
01Gn 15:15 Now as for you, you'll go to your ancestors in peace - you'll be buried at a good old age. 
01Gn 15:16 Your descendants will return here in the fourth generation, since the iniquity of the Amorites has not yet run its course."
01Gn 15:17 When the sun had fully set and it was dark, a smoking fire pot and a fiery torch passed between the animal pieces. 
01Gn 15:18 That very day the Lord made this covenant with Abram£º "I'm giving this land to your descendants, from the river of Egypt to the great Euphrates River -  
01Gn 15:19 including the land of the Kenites, the Kenizzites, the Kadmonites, 
01Gn 15:20 the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Rephaim,
01Gn 15:21 the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Girgashites, and the Jebusites."
01Gn 16:1 Now Abram's wife Sarai had not borne a child for him. She had an Egyptian servant girl whose name was Hagar. 
01Gn 16:2 So Sarai said to Abram, "You are well aware that the Lord has prevented me from giving birth to a child. Go in to my servant, so that I may possibly bear a son through her." Abram listened to Sarai's suggestion, 
01Gn 16:3 so Abram's wife Sarai took her Egyptian servant, Hagar, and gave her as a wife to her husband Abram. This took place ten years after Abram had settled in the land of Canaan. 
01Gn 16:4 He went in to Hagar, and she became pregnant. When she realized that she was pregnant, she looked with contempt on her mistress.163
01Gn 16:5 Then Sarai told Abram, "My suffering is your fault! I gave my servant into your embrace, and when she discovered that she was pregnant, she looked on me with contempt. May the Lord judge between you and me!"
01Gn 16:6 Abram answered Sarai, "Look, your servant is under your control, so do to her as you wish." So Sarai dealt so harshly with Hagar that she ran away from Sarai.16
01Gn 16:7 The angel of the Lord found her by a spring of water in the desert on the road to Shur. 
01Gn 16:8 "Hagar, servant of Sarai," he asked, "Where are you coming from and where are you going?" She answered, "I am running away from my mistress Sarai."
01Gn 16:9 The angel of the Lord said to her, "You must go back to your mistress and submit to her authority." 
01Gn 16:10 The angel of the Lord also said to her, "I will greatly multiply your offspring, who will be too many to count.
01Gn 16:11 "Look, you are pregnant and will give birth to a son," the angel of the Lord continued to say to her. "You will name him Ishmael, because the Lord has heard your cry of misery. 
01Gn 16:12 He'll be a wild donkey of a man. He'll be against everyone, and everyone will be against him. He will live in conflict with all of his relatives."
01Gn 16:13 So she called the name of Lord who spoke to her, "You are 'God who sees,' because I have truly seen the one who looks after me."
01Gn 16:14 That's is why the spring was called, "The Well of the Living One who looks after me." It was between Kadesh and Bered.
01Gn 16:15 Hagar eventually gave birth to Abram's son. Abram named his son whom Hagar bore Ishmael. 
01Gn 16:16 Abram was 86 years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael for Abram.
01Gn 17:1 When Abram was 99 years old, the Lord appeared to Abram and announced, "I am God Almighty. Live in my presence and be blameless. 
01Gn 17:2 I'll establish my covenant between me and you, and I'll greatly increase your numbers." 
01Gn 17:3 Then Abram fell to the ground as God continued speaking to him.
01Gn 17:4 "Look, I have made a covenant with you. You will be the father of many nations. 
01Gn 17:5 Your name is no longer to be Abram. Instead your name will be Abraham, since I'll make you the father of many nations. 
01Gn 17:6 I'm going to cause you to become very fruitful, and I'll bring nations from you. Kings will come from you. 
01Gn 17:7 I'm establishing my covenant between me and you, and with your descendants who come after you throughout their generations as an eternal covenant, to be your God and your descendants' God after you. 
01Gn 17:8 I'll give to you and to your descendants the land to which you have traveled - all the land of Canaan - as an eternal possession. I will be their God."
01Gn 17:9 God continued to speak to Abraham, "You and your descendants who follow you are to keep my covenant, that is, you and your descendants after you, throughout their generations. 
01Gn 17:10 Here is my covenant that you are to observe, between me and you and your descendants that follow£º Every male among you is to be circumcised. 
01Gn 17:11 "You are all to be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskin, and this is to be the sign of the covenant between me and you. 
01Gn 17:12 Throughout your generations, every male among you who is eight days old is to be circumcised, including the servant born in your house or the one purchased from a foreigner, who is not of your offspring. 
01Gn 17:13 The servant born in your house or the one purchased with money is to be circumcised. My covenant is to remain in your flesh as an eternal covenant. 
01Gn 17:14 Any uncircumcised male who does not have the foreskin of his flesh circumcised, that male will be eliminated from his people because he has broken my covenant."
01Gn 17:15 God said to Abraham, "As for Sarai your wife, you are not to call her Sarai any longer, because her name is to be Sarah. 
01Gn 17:16 I will bless her. Furthermore, I will give you a son from her. I will bless her, so that nations, kings, and people will come from her."
01Gn 17:17 Abraham fell to the ground, laughed, and said to himself, "Can a child be born to a 100 year old man -  Can a 90 year old Sarah give birth?" 
01Gn 17:18 So Abraham responded to God, "If only Ishmael would live in your presence!"
01Gn 17:19 But God replied, "No, but your wife Sarah will give birth to a son by you, and you will name him Isaac. I will confirm my covenant with him as an eternal covenant for his descendants after him. 
01Gn 17:20 And as for Ishmael, I have heard you. I will bless him, and he will be fruitful. I will multiply him greatly, and he will father 12 tribal leaders. I will make him into a great nation. 
01Gn 17:21 But I will confirm my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will give birth for you at this time next year." 
01Gn 17:22 With that, God finished talking to Abraham, and ascended from him.17
01Gn 17:23 Abraham took his son Ishmael and all the servants born in his house or purchased with his money - every male among the men of Abraham's household - and he circumcised the flesh of their foreskin that very day, just as God had spoken to him.17 
01Gn 17:24 Abraham was 99 years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
01Gn 17:25 His son Ishmael was 13 years old when he was circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin. 
01Gn 17:26 Both Abraham and his son Ishmael were circumcised on that very day. 
01Gn 17:27 Every man born in his household, as well as those who had been purchased with money from a foreigner, were circumcised with him.1726
01Gn 18:1 Later, the Lord appeared to Abraham by the oaks of Mamre, as Abraham was sitting near the entrance to his tent during the hottest part of the day. 
01Gn 18:2 He glanced up and saw three men standing there not far from him. As soon as he noticed them, Abraham ran from the tent entrance to greet them and bowed down to the ground. 
01Gn 18:3 "My lords," he said to them, "if I have found favor with you, please don't leave your servant. 
01Gn 18:4 Let a little water be brought to wash your feet, and then rest under the tree. 
01Gn 18:5 I'll bring some food for you, and after that you may continue your journey, since you have come by your servant's way." So they replied, "Do what you have said." 
01Gn 18:6 Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah and said, "Quick! Three measures of the best flour! Knead it and make flat bread."
01Gn 18:7 Next, Abraham ran to the herd, found a choice and tender calf, and gave it to the young men, who went off in a hurry to prepare it. 
01Gn 18:8 Then he took curds, milk, and the calf that had been prepared, and placed it in front of them. Then he stood by them under the tree while they ate.
01Gn 18:9 They asked him, "Where is your wife Sarah?" "There, in the tent," he replied.
01Gn 18:10 Then one of them said, "I will certainly return to you in about a year's time. By then, your wife Sarah will have borne a son." Now Sarah was listening at the tent entrance behind him. 
01Gn 18:11 Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in age, and Sarah was beyond the age of childbearing. 
01Gn 18:12 That's why Sarah laughed to herself, thinking, "After I have grown old and my husband is old, am I going to have sex?"
01Gn 18:13 The Lord asked Abraham, "Why did Sarah laugh and think, 'Am I really going to bear a child, since I am so old?' 
01Gn 18:14 Is anything impossible for the Lord -  At the time set for it, I will return to you - about a year from now - and Sarah will have a son."
01Gn 18:15 But Sarah denied it. "I didn't laugh," she claimed, because she was afraid. He replied, "No! You did laugh!"
01Gn 18:16 After this, the men set out from there and looked out over Sodom. Abraham went with them to send them off.
01Gn 18:17 "Should I hide from Abraham what I am about to do," the Lord asked, 
01Gn 18:18 "since Abraham will become a great and powerful nation, and all the nations of the earth will find blessing through him -  
01Gn 18:19 Indeed, I have made myself known to him in order that he may charge his sons and his household after him to keep the way of the Lord, and to do what is right and just, so that the Lord may bring about for Abraham what he has promised."
01Gn 18:20 The Lord also said, "How great is the outcry against Sodom and Gomorrah! Their sin is so very serious! 
01Gn 18:21 I'm going down to see whether they have acted according to the outcry that has reached me. If not, I wish to know." 
01Gn 18:22 Then two of the men turned away from there and walked toward Sodom, while Abraham remained standing in the presence of the Lord.
01Gn 18:23 Abraham approached and asked, "Will you actually sweep away the righteous along with the wicked -  
01Gn 18:24 Perhaps there are 50 righteous ones within the city. Will you actually sweep it away and not forgive the place for the sake of the 50 righteous that are found there -  
01Gn 18:25 Far be it from you to do such a thing - to kill the righteous along with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike! Will the Judge of all the earth not do what is right?"
01Gn 18:26 The Lord said, "If I find in Sodom 50 righteous people within the city, I will forgive the whole place for their sake."
01Gn 18:27 Abraham answered, "Look, even though I am only dust and ashes, I've ventured to speak to my Lord. 
01Gn 18:28 What if there are five less than 50 righteous ones -  Will you bring destruction upon the city because of the five?" He said, "I won't destroy it if I find 45 there."
01Gn 18:29 Abraham continued to speak to him, asking, "What if 40 are found there?" He replied, "I won't do it for the sake of the 40."
01Gn 18:30 Abraham then said, "I hope my Lord will not be angry if I speak. What if 30 are found there?" He answered, "I won't do it for the sake of the 30." 
01Gn 18:31 He said, "Look, I have taken it on myself to speak to my Lord, so what if 20 are found there?" He answered, "For the sake of the 20, I will not destroy it."
01Gn 18:32 Lastly, he said, "I hope my Lord will not be angry if I speak only once more. What if ten are found there?" He replied, "For the sake of the ten I won't destroy it." As soon as he finished talking to Abraham, the Lord went on his way, and Abraham returned to where he had been sitting.
01Gn 19:1 The two angels entered Sodom at sunset while Lot was sitting in the gate area of Sodom. When Lot saw them, he got up, greeted them, bowed low with his face to the ground, 
01Gn 19:2 and said, "Look my lords, please turn aside to your servant's house, wash your feet, and spend the night. Then you can get up early and be on your way."1But they responded, "No, we would rather spend the night in the town square."
01Gn 19:3 But Lot kept urging them strongly, so they turned aside and entered his house. He prepared a feast and baked unleavened flat bread for them, and they ate.
01Gn 19:4 Before they could lay down, all the men of the city and its outskirts (that is, of Sodom), both young and old, surrounded the house. 
01Gn 19:5 They called out to Lot and asked him, "Where are the men who came to you tonight -  Bring them out to us so we can have sex with them!"
01Gn 19:6 Lot went outside the entrance to them, shut the door behind him, 
01Gn 19:7 and said, "I urge you, my brothers, don't do such a wicked thing. 
01Gn 19:8 Look here, I have two daughters who are virgins. Let me bring them out to you, and you may do to them whatever you wish, only don't do anything to these men, because they're here under my protection."
01Gn 19:9 But they replied, "Get out of our way! This fellow came here as an alien, and now he's acting like a judge! So we're going to deal more harshly with you than with them." Then they pushed hard against the man (that is, against Lot), intending to break down the door. 
01Gn 19:10 But the angels inside reached out, dragged Lot into the house with them, shut the door, 
01Gn 19:11 and struck the men who were at the entrance of the house with blindness, from the least to the greatest, so they were unable to find the doorway.
01Gn 19:12 The angels asked Lot, "Do you have anyone else here in the city -  A son-in-law -  Sons -  Daughters -  Get them out of this place, 
01Gn 19:13 because we're going to destroy it. The Lord knows how their behavior stinks, so he sent us here to destroy it!
01Gn 19:14 Lot then went out and told his sons-in-law, who had married his daughters, "Get out of here! The Lord is going to destroy this city!" But his sons-in-law thought he was joking.
01Gn 19:15 As dawn was breaking, the angels pressured Lot. "Get going!" they told him. "Take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be engulfed by the punishment of the city."
01Gn 19:16 But he lingered on in the city, so the men grabbed his hand and the hands of his wife and two daughters (because of the Lord's compassion for him!) and they brought them out of the city and left them outside.
01Gn 19:17 After they had brought them outside, one of them said, "Flee for your lives! Don't look back or stop anywhere on the plain. Escape to the hills, or you will be swept away!"
01Gn 19:18 "No, please, my lords!" Lot pleaded with them. 
01Gn 19:19 "Your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have shown me your gracious love in how you have dealt with me by keeping me alive. I cannot escape to the hills, because I'm afraid the disaster will overtake me, and I'll die. 
01Gn 19:20 Look, there is a town nearby where I can flee, and it's a small one. Let me escape there! It's a small one, isn't it -  That way I'll stay alive!"
01Gn 19:21 "All right," he replied to Lot, "I'll agree with your request! I won't overthrow the town that you mentioned. 
01Gn 19:22 Hurry up and flee there, because I cannot do anything until you go there." Therefore the name of the town was called Zoar.
01Gn 19:23 The sun had risen over the land about the time Lot reached Zoar. 
01Gn 19:24 Then the Lord rained sulfur and fire out of the sky from the Lord on Sodom and Gomorrah, 
01Gn 19:25 overthrowing those cities, all of the plain, and everyone who lived in the cities. He also destroyed the plants that grew out of the ground. 
01Gn 19:26 But Lot's wife looked back as she lingered behind him, and she became a pillar of salt.
01Gn 19:27 Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he had stood before the Lord earlier. 
01Gn 19:28 He looked off toward Sodom, Gomorrah, and the entire plain, and he saw smoke rising from the land like smoke from a furnace. 
01Gn 19:29 And so it was that, when God destroyed the cities of the plain, he remembered Abraham and brought Lot out from the midst of the destruction when he overthrew the cities where Lot had lived.19
01Gn 19:30 Later on, Lot and his two daughters abandoned Zoar and settled in the hills because Lot was afraid to live in Zoar. He lived there in a cave, along with his two daughters. 
01Gn 19:31 One day the firstborn said to the younger one, "Our father is old, and there's no man in the land to have sex with us, as everybody else throughout all the earth does. 
01Gn 19:32 Come on! Let's make our father drink wine, and then we'll have sex with him so we can preserve our father's lineage."31
01Gn 19:33 So they had their father drink wine that night, and the older one went in and had sexual relations with her father, but he was not aware when she lay down or when she arose. 
01Gn 19:34 The next day the firstborn said to the younger one, "Look! I had sex with my father last night. Let's make him drink wine tonight again as well. Then you go in and have sex with him, too. That way we'll preserve our father's lineage."19
01Gn 19:35 So they made their father drink wine that night as well, but he was not aware when she lay down or when she arose.
01Gn 19:36 That's how both of Lot's daughters became pregnant by their father. 
01Gn 19:37 The firstborn gave birth to a son and named him Moab, and he is the ancestor of the Moabites to this day. 
01Gn 19:38 The younger also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-ammi, and he is the ancestor of the Ammonites to this day.
01Gn 20:1 Abraham traveled from there to the region of the Negev and settled between Kadish and Shur. While he was living in Gerar as an outsider, 
01Gn 20:2 because Abraham kept saying about his wife Sarah, "She is my sister," King Abimelech of Gerar summoned them and took Sarah into his household.
01Gn 20:3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream during the night and spoke to him, "Pay attention! You're about to die, because the woman you have taken is a man's wife!"
01Gn 20:4 Now Abimelech had not yet come near her, so he asked, "Lord, will you destroy an innocent nation -  
01Gn 20:5 Didn't he say to me, 'She's my sister' -  And she also said, 'He's my brother.' I did this with pure intentions and clean hands."
01Gn 20:6 Then God replied to him in the dream, "I know that you did this with pure intentions, and it was I who kept you from sinning against me. Therefore, I didn't allow you to touch her. 
01Gn 20:7 Now then, return the man's wife. As a matter of fact, he's a prophet and can intercede for you so you'll live. But if you don't return her, be aware that you and all who are yours will certainly die."
01Gn 20:8 So Abimelech got up early the next morning, summoned all his servants, and told them all these things. The men became terrified.
01Gn 20:9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and asked him, "What have you done to us -  How have I sinned against you, that you have brought such great sin against me and my kingdom -  You've done things to me that ought not to have been done."
01Gn 20:10 Abimelech also asked Abraham, "What could you have been thinking when you did this?"
01Gn 20:11 "I thought that there is no fear of God in this place," Abraham replied, "and that they would kill me because of my wife. 
01Gn 20:12 Besides, she really is my sister - she's my father's daughter, but not my mother's daughter - so she could become my wife. 
01Gn 20:13 When God caused me to journey from my father's house, I asked her to do me this favor and say, 'He is my brother.'"
01Gn 20:14 So Abimelech took some sheep and oxen, and some male and female servants, gave them to Abraham, returned his wife Sarah to him, 
01Gn 20:15 and said, "Look! My land is in front of you. Settle wherever you please."
01Gn 20:16 Abimelech also said to Sarah, "Look! I am giving your brother 1,000 pieces of silver to vindicate you in the eyes of all who are with you. As a result, you will be completely vindicated."
01Gn 20:17 Then Abraham interceded with God, and God healed Abimelech, his wife, and his female servants so they could bear children, 
01Gn 20:18 since the Lord had completely closed all the wombs of Abimelech's household on account of Abraham's wife Sarah.
01Gn 21:1 The Lord came to Sarah, just as he had said, and the Lord did for Sarah what he had promised. 
01Gn 21:2 Sarah conceived and gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age, at the very time that God had predicted.
01Gn 21:3 Abraham named his son who was born to him Isaac - the very one whom Sarah bore to him! 
01Gn 21:4 Then Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, just as God had commanded him. 
01Gn 21:5 Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born to him.
01Gn 21:6 Now Sarah had said, "God has caused me to laugh, and all who hear about it will laugh with me." 
01Gn 21:7 She also said, "Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse sons -  Yet I have given birth to a son in his old age!"
01Gn 21:8 The child grew and eventually was weaned, so Abraham threw a tremendous banquet on the very day Isaac was weaned. 
01Gn 21:9 Nevertheless, when Sarah saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian - whom Hagar had borne to Abraham - making fun of Isaac, 
01Gn 21:10 she told Abraham, "Throw out this slave girl, along with her son, because this slave's son will never be a co-heir with my son Isaac!"9
01Gn 21:11 Abraham was very troubled about what was being said about his son, 
01Gn 21:12 but God told Abraham, "Don't be troubled about the youth and your slave girl. Pay attention to Sarah in everything she tells you, because your offspring are to be named through Isaac. 
01Gn 21:13 Nevertheless, I will make a nation of the slave girl's son, since he, too, is your offspring."
01Gn 21:14 So early the next morning, Abraham got up, took bread and a skin of water, gave them to Hagar, and placed them on her shoulder. He then sent her away, along with with the child. She went off and roamed in the Beersheba wilderness.
01Gn 21:15 Eventually, the water in the skin ran out, and she placed the child under one of the bushes. 
01Gn 21:16 Then she went and sat by herself about a distance of a bowshot away, because she kept saying to herself, "I can't bear to watch the child die!" That's why she sat a short distance away, crying aloud and weeping.2115
01Gn 21:17 God heard the boy's voice, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven. He asked her, "What's wrong with you, Hagar -  Don't be afraid, because God has heard the voice of the youth where he is. 
01Gn 21:18 Get up! Pick up the youth and take hold of him with your hand, because I will make a great nation of him."
01Gn 21:19 Then God opened her eyes, and she saw a well of water. So she went, filled the skin with water, and gave the boy a drink. 
01Gn 21:20 God was with the boy as he grew up. He settled in the wilderness and became an expert archer. 
01Gn 21:21 Later he settled in the desert area of Paran, and his mother chose a wife for him from the land of Egypt.
01Gn 21:22 About that time, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, "God is with you in everything that you're doing. 
01Gn 21:23 Therefore swear an oath here by God that you won't deal falsely with me, my sons, or my descendants. Just as I've dealt graciously with you, won't you do so with me and with the land in which you live as a foreigner?"
01Gn 21:24 And Abraham replied, "I agree!" 
01Gn 21:25 But then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water that Abimelech's servants had seized. 
01Gn 21:26 "I don't know who did this thing," Abimelech replied, "and you didn't report this to me nor did I hear about this until today."
01Gn 21:27 So Abraham took sheep and oxen and presented them to Abimelech, and the two of them made a covenant. 
01Gn 21:28 Then Abraham set aside seven ewe lambs, 
01Gn 21:29 so Abimelech asked Abraham, "What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs that you have set aside?"
01Gn 21:30 He replied, "You are to accept from me these seven ewe lambs as a witness that I have dug this well." 
01Gn 21:31 Therefore that place was called Beersheba, because the two of them swore an oath. 
01Gn 21:32 So after they had made a covenant in Beersheba, Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, left and returned to Philistine territory.
01Gn 21:33 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree in Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the Lord God Everlasting. 
01Gn 21:34 After this, Abraham resided as a foreigner in Philistine territory for a long period of time.
01Gn 22:1 Sometime after these events, God tested Abraham. He called out to him, "Abraham!" "Here I am," he answered.
01Gn 22:2 God said, "Please take your son, your only unique son whom you love - Isaac - and go to the land of Moriah. Offer him as a burnt offering there on one of the mountains that I will point out to you."
01Gn 22:3 So Abraham got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his male servants with him along with his son Isaac. He cut the wood for the burnt offering and set out to go to place about which God had spoken to him. 
01Gn 22:4 On the third day he looked ahead and saw the place from a distance.
01Gn 22:5 Abraham ordered his two servants, "Both of you stay here with the donkey. Now as for the youth and I, we'll go up there, we'll worship, and then we'll return to you." 
01Gn 22:6 Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and placed it on his son Isaac. Abraham carried the fire and the knife. And so the two of them went on together.
01Gn 22:7 Isaac spoke to his father Abraham and said, "My father." "I am here, my son," Abraham replied. Isaac asked, "The fire and the wood are here, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?"
01Gn 22:8 Abraham answered, "God will provide himself the lamb for the burnt offering, my son." The two of them went on together 
01Gn 22:9 and came to the place about which God had spoken. Abraham built an altar there, arranged the wood, tied up his son Isaac, and placed him on the altar on top of the wood. 
01Gn 22:10 Then he stretched out his hand and grabbed the knife to slaughter his son.
01Gn 22:11 Just then, an angel of the Lord called out to him from heaven and said, "Abraham! Abraham!" "Here I am," he answered.
01Gn 22:12 "Don't lay your hand on the youth!" he said. "Don't do anything to him, because I've just demonstrated that you fear God, since you have not withheld your son, your only unique one, from me."
01Gn 22:13 Then Abraham looked up and behind him to see a ram caught by its horns in the thicket. So Abraham went over, grabbed the ram, and offered it as a burnt offering in place of his son. 
01Gn 22:14 Abraham named that place, "The Lord Will Provide," as it is said to this day, "On the Lord's mountain, he will provide."2213
01Gn 21:15 The angel of the Lord called to Abraham a second time from heaven 
01Gn 21:16 and said, "I have taken an oath to swear by myself," declares the Lord, "that since you have carried this out and have not withheld your only unique son, 
01Gn 22:17 I will certainly bless you and make your descendants as numerous as the stars in heaven and as the sand on the seashore. Your descendants will take possession of the gates of their enemies. 
01Gn 22:18 Furthermore, through your descendants all the nations of the earth will be blessed, because you have obeyed my command."1522
01Gn 22:19 After this, Abraham returned to his servants and they set out together for Beersheba, where Abraham settled.
01Gn 22:20 Now after these things somebody told Abraham, "Look, Milcah has given birth to sons for your brother Nahor. 
01Gn 22:21 Uz is his firstborn, Buz is his brother, and Kemuel is the father of Aram, 
01Gn 22:22 Chesed, Hazo, Pildash, Jidlaph, and Bethuel."
01Gn 22:23 Bethuel fathered Rebekah. Milcah bore these eight sons to Nahor, Abraham's brother. 
01Gn 22:24 Also, his concubine Reumah gave birth to Tebah, Gaham, Tahash, and Maacah.
01Gn 23:1 Sarah lived for 127 years. That's how long Sarah's life was. 
01Gn 23:2 Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, in Hebron) in the land of Canaan. Abraham went in to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her.
01Gn 23:3 Then Abraham rose up from beside his dead wife and addressed the Hittites. He said, 
01Gn 23:4 "I am an alien and an outsider among you. Give me a cemetery among you where I can bury my dead away from my presence."
01Gn 23:5 The Hittites responded to Abraham, 
01Gn 23:6 "Listen to us, my lord. You are a mighty prince among us. Bury your dead in the choicest of our burial tombs. None of us would refuse you his tomb for burying your dead."
01Gn 23:7 Abraham rose and bowed before the Hittites, the people of the land, 
01Gn 23:8 and addressed them, "If you are willing that I should bury my dead away from my presence, listen to me and make a request of Zohar's son Ephron on my behalf. 
01Gn 23:9 Give me the cave of Machpelah that belongs to him, at the end of his field. He should sell it to me in your presence at full price for a burial site."
01Gn 23:10 Now since Ephron the Hittite had taken a seat there among the Hittites, he responded publicly to Abraham in the hearing of the Hittites and everyone who was entering the gate of his city, 
01Gn 23:11 "No, my lord. Listen to me! I'll give you the field, and I'll give you the cave that's in it. I give it to you publicly, in the sight of my people. Bury your dead."
01Gn 23:12 Abraham bowed before the people of the land 
01Gn 23:13 and then addressed Ephron in the full hearing of the people of the land, "Please listen to me! I'm willing to pay the price of the field. Accept it from me, so I may bury my dead there."
01Gn 23:14 So Ephron answered Abraham, 
01Gn 23:15 "My lord, listen to me! The land is worth 400 shekels of silver, but what's that between us -  You may bury your dead."
01Gn 23:16 Abraham agreed with Ephron, so he weighed out to Ephron the money he had agreed publicly in the hearing of the Hittites£º 400 shekels of silver at the current merchant rate.
01Gn 23:17 That's how Ephron's field in Machpelah, east of Mamre - the field, the cave that was in it, and all the trees that were within the boundaries of the field - came to be deeded 
01Gn 23:18 to Abraham in the presence of all the Hittites and everyone who was entering the city gate.
01Gn 23:19 After this, Abraham buried his wife Sarah in the cave at the field of Machpelah, east of Mamre (that is, in Hebron) in the land of Canaan. 
01Gn 23:20 And so the field with its cave was deeded by the Hittites to Abraham as a burial site.
01Gn 24:1 Now Abraham had grown old, was well advanced in age, and the Lord had blessed Abraham in every way. 
01Gn 24:2 So Abraham instructed his servant, who was the oldest member of his household and in charge of everything he owned, "Make this solemn oath to me 
01Gn 24:3 as a promise by the Lord, the God of heaven and earth, that you won't acquire a wife for my son from the Canaanite women among whom I'm living. 
01Gn 24:4 Instead, you are to go to my country and to my family and acquire a wife for my son Isaac."
01Gn 24:5 "What if the woman doesn't want to come back with me to this land?" the servant asked. "Shouldn't I have your son go to the land from which you came?"
01Gn 24:6 "Make sure not to take my son there," Abraham replied in response. 
01Gn 24:7 The Lord God of heaven, who brought me from my father's house and from my family's land, who spoke to me and promised me 'I will give this land to your descendants,' will send his angel ahead of you, and you are to acquire a wife for my son from there. 
01Gn 24:8 If the woman isn't willing to follow you, then you'll be free from this oath to me. Just don't take my son back there!" 
01Gn 24:9 So the servant made a solemn oath to his master Abraham regarding this matter.7
01Gn 24:10 Then Abraham's servant took ten camels from his master's herd of camels and left on his journey with all kinds of gifts from his master's inventory. Eventually, he traveled as far as Aram-Naharayim, Nahor's home town. 
01Gn 24:11 As evening approached, he had the camels kneel outside the town at the water well, right about the time when women customarily went out to draw water.
01Gn 24:12 That's when he prayed, "Lord God of my master Abraham, help me to succeed today. Please show your gracious love to my master Abraham. 
01Gn 24:13 I've stationed myself here by the spring as the women of the town come to draw water. 
01Gn 24:14 May it be that the young woman to whom I ask, 'Please, lower your jug so that I may drink,' responds, 'Have a drink, and I'll water your camels as well.' May she be the one whom you have appointed f or your servant Isaac. This is how I'll know that you have shown your gracious love to my master."
01Gn 24:15 Before he had finished speaking, Rebekah appeared. She was daughter of Melkah's son Bethuel, the wife of Abraham's brother Nahor. She approached the well, carrying a jug on her shoulder. 
01Gn 24:16 The woman was very beautiful, young, and had not had intimate relations with a man. Going down to the spring, she filled her jug and returned. 
01Gn 24:17 Then the servant ran to meet her and asked her, "Please, let me have a sip of water from your jug."
01Gn 24:18 "Drink, sir!" she replied as she quickly lowered her jug on her arm to offer him a drink. 
01Gn 24:19 When she had finished giving him a drink, she also said, "I'll also draw water for your camels until they've had enough to drink."
01Gn 24:20 She quickly emptied her jug into the trough and ran to the well to draw again until she had drawn enough water for all ten of his camels. 
01Gn 24:21 The man stared at her in silence, waiting to see whether or not the Lord had made his journey successful.
01Gn 24:22 When the camels had finished drinking, the man took out a gold nose ring weighing a half shekel and two bracelets for her wrists, weighing 10 shekels and presented them to her.
01Gn 24:23 "Whose daughter are you?" he asked. "Please tell me, is there room in your father's house for us to spend the night?"
01Gn 24:24 "I am the daughter of Bethuel," she answered. He's Milcah's and Nahor's son." 
01Gn 24:25 And she continued, "Yes, we have plenty of straw and feed, as well as a place to spend the night."
01Gn 24:26 At this, the man bowed down and worshipped the Lord. 
01Gn 24:27 "Blessed be the Lord God of my master Abraham, who hasn't held back his gracious love and faithfulness from my master! The Lord has led me to the house of my master's relatives!"
01Gn 24:28 The girl then ran ahead and informed her mother's household what had happened.
01Gn 24:29 Now Rebekah had a brother named Laban, who ran out to the man and met him at the spring. 
01Gn 24:30 And so it was, as soon as he saw the nose ring and bracelets on his sister's wrists, and as soon as he heard what his sister Rebekah was saying about what the man had spoken to her, he went out to the man who was still standing by the camels at the spring!
01Gn 24:31 "Come on," he said. "The Lord has blessed you! So why are you standing out here when I've prepared some space in the house and a place for the camels?"
01Gn 24:32 So the servant went to the house and unbridled the camels. They provided straw and feed for the camels and water for washing his feet and those of the men with him. 
01Gn 24:33 But when they had prepared a meal and set it in front of him, he said, "I'm not eating until I've spoken." "Speak up!" Laban cried. 01Gn 24:34"I'm Abraham's servant," he said. 
01Gn 24:35 "The Lord has greatly blessed my master, so that he has become wealthy. He has provided him sheep and cattle, silver and gold, male and female servants, camels and donkeys. 
01Gn 24:36 My master's wife Sarah gave birth to my master's son in her old age, and he has given him everything that belongs to him. 
01Gn 24:37 My master made me swear this oath£º 'You are not to select a wife for my son from among the daughters of the Canaanites in this land where I live. 
01Gn 24:38 Instead, you are to go to my father's household, to my relatives, and chose a wife for my son there.'
01Gn 24:39 "So I asked my master, 'What if the woman won't come back with me?'
01Gn 24:40 "Abraham told me, 'The Lord, in whose presence I walk, will send his angel with you to make your journey successful. So you are to choose a wife for my son from my family, from my father's household. 
01Gn 24:41 Only then will you be released from my oath. However, when you come to my family, if they don't give her to you, you'll be released from my oath.'
01Gn 24:42 "So today I arrived at the spring and prayed, 'Lord God of my master Abraham, if you wish to make the journey that I have traveled successful, 
01Gn 24:43 here I am standing by the water spring. May it be that the young woman who comes out to draw water, from whom I request a little water from her jug to drink, 
01Gn 24:44 if she tells me to drink and also draws for the camels, may she be the woman that the Lord has chosen for my master's son.43
01Gn 24:45 "Before I had finished praying, along came Rebekah with her jug on her shoulder! She went to the spring and drew some water. I asked her to please let me have a drink. 
01Gn 24:46 She quickly lowered her jug from her shoulder and told me, 'Have a drink while I also water your camels.' So I drank, and she also gave my camels water to drink.45
01Gn 24:47 "That's when I asked, 'Whose daughter are you?' "She replied, 'I'm the daughter of Bethuel, Nahor's son, whom Milcah bore to him.' "So I gave her a ring for her nose and bracelets for her wrists. 
01Gn 24:48 I bowed down and worshipped the Lord, and I praised the Lord God of my master Abraham, who led me on the true way to request the daughter of my master's brother for his son. 
01Gn 24:49 So now, if you wish to show gracious love and truth toward my master, tell me so. But if not, tell me, so that I may go elsewhere."
01Gn 24:50 "Since this has come from the Lord," Laban and Bethuel both replied, "we cannot speak one way or another. 
01Gn 24:51 So here's Rebekah - she's right in front of you. Take her and go, so she can become a wife for your master's son, just as the Lord has decreed."
01Gn 24:52 When Abraham's servant heard what they had said, he bowed down to the ground before the Lord. 
01Gn 24:53 Then the servant brought out some silver and gold items, along with some clothing, and gave them to Rebekah. He also gave gifts to her brother and to her mother. 
01Gn 24:54 He and the men with him ate and drank, and then they spent the night. When they got up the next morning, the servant requested, "Send me off to my master."
01Gn 24:55 But her brother and mother said, "Let the young lady stay with us a few days - at least ten - and after that she may go."
01Gn 24:56 "Please don't delay me," the servant answered them. "The Lord has made my journey successful. Send me off so I can return to my master."
01Gn 24:57 But they said, "We'll call the young lady and see what she has to say about this."
01Gn 24:58 So they called Rebekah and asked her, "Do you want to go with this man?" "I will go," she replied.
01Gn 24:59 So they sent off their sister Rebekah, along with her personal assistant, Abraham's servant, and his men. 
01Gn 24:60 As they were leaving, they all blessed Rebekah, saying,       "Our sister, may you become the mother of tens of millions! May your descendants take over the city gates of those who hate them." 
01Gn 24:61 Then Rebekah and her young servant women got up, mounted their camels, and followed Abraham's servant, who took Rebekah and went on his way.
01Gn 24:62 Later on, as Isaac was returning one evening from Beer-lahai-roi (he had been living in the Negev region), 
01Gn 24:63 went out walking in a field. He looked up, and all of a sudden there were some camels coming. 
01Gn 24:64 Rebekah looked up, and when she saw Isaac she quickly dismounted from the camel 
01Gn 24:65 and asked the servant, "Who is that man coming in the field to meet us?" "That's my master," the servant told her. So she reached for a veil and covered herself. 
01Gn 24:66 Then the servant informed Isaac about everything he had done. 
01Gn 24:67 Later, Isaac brought Rebekah into the tent that had belonged to his mother Sarah and married her. Isaac loved her, and that's how he was comforted following the loss of his mother.
01Gn 25:1 Abraham had taken another wife whose name was Keturah. 
01Gn 25:2 She bore him Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 
01Gn 25:3 Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. Dedan's sons were the Asshurites, Letushites, and Leummites. 
01Gn 25:4 Midian's sons were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All of these were Keturah's descendants.
01Gn 25:5 Abraham gave everything he owned to Isaac. 
01Gn 25:6 While he was still alive, Abraham gave gifts to his concubines and sent them to the east country in order to keep them away from his son Isaac.
01Gn 25:7 Abraham lived for a total of 175 years. 
01Gn 25:8 Then Abraham passed away, dying at a ripe old age, having lived a full life, and was joined to his people. 
01Gn 25:9 His sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah near Mamre, in the field that used to belong to Zohar the Hethite's son Ephron. 
01Gn 25:10 This was the same field that Abraham had bought from the son of Heth, where Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried. 
01Gn 25:11 After Abraham's death, God blessed his son Isaac, who continued to live near Beer-Lahai-Roi.10
01Gn 25:12 Now this is what happened to Ishmael, whom Sarah's Egyptian servant Hagar bore for Abraham. 
01Gn 25:13 Here's a list of the names of Ishmael's sons, recorded by their names and descendants£º Nebaioth was the first born, followed by Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 
01Gn 25:14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 
01Gn 25:15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 
01Gn 25:16 These were Ishmael's children, listed by their names according to their villages and their camps. There were a total of twelve tribal chiefs, according to their clans. 
01Gn 25:17 Ishmael lived for 137 years, then he took his last breath, died, and joined his people. 
01Gn 25:18 His descendants settled from Havilah to Shur (that's near Egypt), all the way to Assyria, in defiance of all of his relatives.16
01Gn 25:19 This is the account of Isaac, Abraham's son. Abraham fathered Isaac. 
01Gn 25:20 Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel, the Syrian from Paddan-Aram and sister of Laban the Syrian. 
01Gn 25:21 Later, Isaac prayed to the Lord on behalf of his wife, since she was unable to conceive children, and the Lord responded to him - his wife Rebekah became pregnant.
01Gn 25:22 But when the infants kept on wrestling each other inside her womb, she asked herself, "Why is this happening?" So she sought the Lord for an explanation.
01Gn 25:23 "Two nations are in your womb," the Lord responded, "and two separate people will emerge. One people will be the stronger, and the older one will serve the younger."
01Gn 25:24 Sure enough, when her due date to deliver arrived, she delivered twins. 
01Gn 25:25 The first came out reddish - his entire body being covered with hair - so they named him Esau. 
01Gn 25:26 After that, his brother came out with his hand clutching Esau's heel, so the named him Jacob. Isaac was 60 years old when they were born.
01Gn 25:27 As the boys were growing up, Esau became skilled at hunting and was a man of the outdoors, but Jacob was the quiet type who tended to stay indoors. 
01Gn 25:28 Isaac loved Esau, because he loved to hunt, while Rebekah loved Jacob. 
01Gn 25:29 One day, while Jacob was cooking some stew, Esau happened to come in from being outdoors, and he was feeling famished. 
01Gn 25:30 Esau said to Jacob, "Let me gobble down some of this red stuff, since I'm starving. (That's how Esau got his nickname "Edom".)
01Gn 25:31 But Jacob responded, "Sell me your birthright. Do it now."
01Gn 25:32 "Look! I'm about to die." Esau replied. "What good is this birthright to me?"
01Gn 25:33 But Jacob insisted, "Swear it by an oath right now." So he swore an oath to him and sold his birthright to Jacob. 
01Gn 25:34 Then Jacob gave Esau some of his food and boiled stew, and Esau ate, drank, got up, and left, after having belittled his own birthright.
01Gn 26:1 Later on, a famine swept through the land. This was a different famine from the previous one that occurred during Abraham's lifetime. So Isaac went to Abimelech, king of the Philistines, at Gerar.
01Gn 26:2 That's when the Lord appeared to him. "You are not to go down to Egypt," he said. "Instead, you are to settle down in the land in the area where I'll tell you. 
01Gn 26:3 Remain in this land, and I'll be with and will bless you by giving all these lands to you and to your descendants in fulfillment of my solemn promise that I made to your father Abraham.
01Gn 26:4 "I'll multiply your descendants as the star of the heavens, and I'll certainly give all these lands to your descendants. Later on, through your descendants all the nations of the earth will bless one another. 
01Gn 26:5 I'm going to do this because Abraham did what I told him to do. He kept my instructions, commands, statutes, and laws."
01Gn 26:6 So Isaac lived in Gerar.
01Gn 26:7 Later on, the men of the place asked about his wife, so he replied, "She's my sister," because he was afraid to call her "My wife." He kept thinking, "¡¦otherwise, the men around here will kill me on account of Rebekah, since she is very beautiful."
01Gn 26:8 After he had been there a while, King Abimelech of the Philistines looked out through a window and saw Isaac caressing his wife Rebekah.
01Gn 26:9 So Abimelech called Isaac and confronted him. "She is definitely your wife!" he accused him, "so why did you claim, 'She's my sister?'" Isaac responded to him, "Because I had thought '¡¦otherwise, I'll die on account of her.'"
01Gn 26:10 "What have you done to us?"Abimelech asked. "Any minute now one of the people could have had sex with your wife and you would have brought guilt on all of us." 
01Gn 26:11 So he issued this order to all the people£º "Whoever touches this man or his wife is to be executed." 10
01Gn 26:12 Isaac received a 100-fold return on what he planted that year in the land he received, because the Lord blessed him. 
01Gn 26:13 The man became very wealthy and lived a life of wealth, becoming more and more wealthy. 
01Gn 26:14 He owned so many sheep, cattle, and servants that the Philistines eventually became envious of him. 
01Gn 26:15 They filled in with sand all of the wells that his father Abraham's servants had dug during his lifetime.12
01Gn 26:16 Then Abimelech ordered Isaac, "Move away from us! You've become more powerful than we are." 
01Gn 26:17 So Isaac moved from there and encamped in the Gerar Valley, where he settled.
01Gn 26:18 Isaac re-excavated some water wells that his father had first dug during his lifetime, because the Philistines had blocked them after Abraham's death. Isaac renamed them with the same names that his father had called them.
01Gn 26:19 While Isaac's servants were digging in the valley, they discovered a well with flowing water. 
01Gn 26:20 But the herdsmen who lived in Gerar quarreled with Isaac's herdsmen. "The water is ours," they said. As a result, Isaac named the well Esek, for they had fiercely disputed with him about it. 
01Gn 26:21 When his workers started digging another well, they quarreled about that one, too, so he named it Sitnah. 
01Gn 26:22 Then he left that area and dug still another well. Because they did not quarrel over that one, he named it Rehoboth, because he used to say, "The Lord has enlarged the territory for us. We will prosper in the land."
01Gn 26:23 Later on, he left there and went to Beersheba, 
01Gn 26:24 where one night the Lord appeared to him. "I'm the God of your father Abraham," he told him. "Don't be afraid, because I'm with you. I'm going to bless you and multiply your descendants on account of my servant Abraham." 
01Gn 26:25 In response, Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the Lord. He also pitched his tents there and his servants dug a well.
01Gn 26:26 Later, Abimelech traveled to visit Isaac from Gerar. He arrived with Ahuzzath, his staff advisor, and Phicol, the commanding officer of his army. "Why have you come to see me," Isaac asked them, "since you hate me so muc h that you sent me away from you?"
01Gn 26:28 "We've seen that the Lord is with you," they responded, "so we're proposing an agreement between us - between us and you. Allow us to make a treaty with you 
01Gn 26:29 by which you'll agree not to do us any harm, just as we haven't harmed you, since we've done nothing but good for you after we sent you away in peace. As a result, you've been tremendously blessed by the Lord." 
01Gn 26:30 So Isaac held a feast for them and they ate and drank. 
01Gn 26:31 They woke up early the next morning and made the treaty. After this, Isaac sent them off and they left on peaceful terms. 
01Gn 26:32 That very same day, Isaac's servants arrived and reported to him about a well that they had just completed digging. "We've found water!" they said. 
01Gn 26:33 So Isaac named the well Shebah, which is why the city is named Beersheba to this day. 
01Gn 26:34 When Esau was 40 years old, he married Judith, the daughter of Beeri the Hittite and Basemath, the daughter of Elon the Hittite. 
01Gn 26:35 This brought extreme grief to Isaac and Rebekah.
01Gn 27:1 Eventually, Isaac grew so old that he could not see. One day, he called his eldest son Esau. "My son," he called out to him. "I'm here," he responded.
01Gn 27:2 "Look how old I am! I could die any day now, 
01Gn 27:3 so go find your weapons, take your bow and arrows, go outside, and hunt some game for me. 
01Gn 27:4 Then prepare some food, just the way I like it, and bring it to me so that I can eat and bless you before I die."
01Gn 27:5 Now Rebekah overheard Isaac while he was speaking to his son Esau. When Esau had gone out to the field to hunt and bring in some game, 
01Gn 27:6 Rebekah gave these instructions to her son Jacob£º "Quick! Pay attention!" she said. "I heard your father talking to your brother Esau. 
01Gn 27:7 He told him, 'Bring me some game and then prepare some food for me so I can eat and bless you in the presence of the Lord before I die.'
01Gn 27:8 "So now, my son, listen to what I have to say and pay attention to what I'm about to tell you. 
01Gn 27:9 Go to the flock and bring me two healthy young goats. I'll prepare some delicious food for your father, just the way he loves it. 
01Gn 27:10 Then you are to take it to your father so that he can eat and bless you before he dies."
01Gn 27:11 "But look!" Jacob pointed out to his mother Rebekah, "My brother Esau is a hairy man, but I'm smooth skinned. 
01Gn 27:12 My father might touch me and he'll realize that I'm deceiving him. Then, I'll bring a curse on myself instead of a blessing."
01Gn 27:13 "My son," she replied, "let any curse against you fall on me. Just listen to me, then go and get them for me."
01Gn 27:14 So out he went, got them, and brought them to his mother, who then prepared some delicious food according to his father's liking.
01Gn 27:15 Then Rebekah took some garments that belonged to her elder son Esau - the best ones available - and put them on her younger son Jacob. 
01Gn 27:16 She put some goat skins over his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. 
01Gn 27:17 Then she handed the delicious food and bread that she had prepared over to her son Jacob, 
01Gn 27:18 who went in to his father and said, "My father¡¦" "It's me," he replied. "Which one are you, my son?"
01Gn 27:19 "I'm Esau, your first born," Jacob said to his father, "I've done what you asked, so please sit up and eat what I caught so you can bless me."
01Gn 27:20 "How did you catch it so quickly, my son?" Isaac asked. Jacob responded, "¡¦because the Lord your God made me successful."
01Gn 27:21 So Isaac said to Jacob, "Come here, my son, so I can feel you and know for sure whether or not you're my son Esau."
01Gn 27:22 So Jacob approached his father, who felt him and said, "It's Jacob's voice, but Esau's hands." 
01Gn 27:23 He didn't recognize Jacob, because his hands were hairy like those of his brother Esau, so Isaac blessed him.
01Gn 27:24 He asked, "Are you really my son Esau?" "I am," Jacob replied.
01Gn 27:25 "Come closer to me," Isaac replied, "so I can eat some of the game, my son, and then bless you." So Isaac came closer, and Isaac ate. He also brought wine so he could drink. 
01Gn 27:26 After this, Jacob's father Isaac told him, "Come closer and kiss me, my son." 
01Gn 27:27 So he drew closer to kiss him. When he smelled the scent of his clothes, he blessed him and said, "How my son's scent is the fragrance of the field, That the Lord has blessed.
01Gn 27:28 May the Lord grant you dew from the skies, and from the fertile land may he grant you abundant grain and fresh wine.
01Gn 27:29 May people serve and bow before you; may you be master over your brothers; may your mother's sons bow before you; May anyone who curses you be cursed; and may anyone who blesses you be blessed.
01Gn 27:30 Just after Isaac had finished blessing Jacob and Jacob had left his father Isaac's presence, his brother Esau returned from hunting, 
01Gn 27:31 prepared some delicious food, brought it to his father, and told him, "Can you get up now, father, so you may eat some of your son's game and then bless me?"
01Gn 27:32 But Isaac's father asked him, "Who are you?" "I'm Esau, your first born son," he answered
01Gn 27:33 At this, Isaac began to tremble violently. 
01Gn 27:34 "Who then," he asked, "hunted some game and brought it to me to eat before you  arrived, so that I've blessed him -  Indeed, he is blessed." When Esau realized what his father Isaac was saying, he began to wail out loud bitterly. "Bless me," he cried, "even me, too, my father!"
01Gn 27:35 Isaac replied, "Your brother came here deceitfully and stole your blessing."
01Gn 27:36 Then he said, "Isn't his name rightly called Jacob?' Esau asked. "He has circumvented me this second time. First, he took away my birthright, and now, look how he also stole my blessing." Then he added, "Haven't you reserved a blessing for me - 
01Gn 27:37 In response, Isaac told Esau, "Look! I've predicted that he's going to become your master, and I've assigned all his brothers to be his servants. What then can I do for you, my son?"
01Gn 27:38 Then Esau implored his father, "Don't you have even one blessing for me, my father -  Bless me, even me too, my father!" Then Esau lifted his voice and wept bitterly.
01Gn 27:39 In response, his father Isaac replied to him, "Look! Away from the fertile land will be your dwellings; away from the dew of the skies above.
01Gn 27:40 By your sword you'll live; but you'll serve your brother. But when you've become restless, you'll break off his yoke from your neck."
01Gn 27:41 So Esau harbored animosity toward Jacob because of the way his father had blessed him. Esau kept saying in his heart, "The time to mourn for my father is very near. That's when I'm going to kill my brother Jacob."
01Gn 27:42 Eventually, what Rebekah's older son Esau had been saying was reported to her, so she sent for her younger son Jacob and warned him, "Look! Your brother is planning to get even by killing you. 
01Gn 27:43 Son, you'd better do what I say! Get up, run off to my brother Laban in Haran,
01Gn 27:44 and stay there with him a few days until your brother's fury sub sides. 
01Gn 27:45 After that happens and he has forgotten what you've done to him, I'll send for you and take you from there. Why should I be bereaved of you both in one day?"27
01Gn 27:46 Rebekah also told herself, "Heth's daughters are making me tired of living. If Jacob marries one of Heth's daughters, and she turns out to be just like these other local women, what kind of life would there be left for me?"
01Gn 28:1 Later, Isaac called Jacob and blessed him, instructing him, "Don't marry a wife from the local Canaanite women. 
01Gn 28:2 Instead, get up, travel to Paddan-Aram, and visit the household of Bethuel, your mother's father. Marry one of Laban's daughters, since he's your mother's brother. 
01Gn 28:3 May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful so that you become a whole group of people. 
01Gn 28:4 May he give you and your descendants the blessings that he gave Abraham. May you possess the land where you have lived that God gave to Abraham."
01Gn 28:5 So Isaac sent Jacob off toward Paddan-Aram to visit Laban, Bethuel's son, the Syrian and brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.
01Gn 28:6 Esau noticed that after Isaac had blessed Jacob as he sent him off to Paddan-Aram to marry a wife from there, he instructed Jacob, "Don't marry a Canaanite woman." 
01Gn 28:7 After Jacob had obeyed his father and mother's instructions to set out for Paddan-Aram, 
01Gn 28:8 Esau realized that Canaan women didn't please his father Isaac, 
01Gn 28:9 so he went to Abraham's son Ishmael and married Ishmael's daughter Mahalath, who was the sister of Nebaioth.
01Gn 28:10 Meanwhile, Jacob had left Beersheba and was on his way to Haran. 
01Gn 28:11 He reached a certain place and spent the night there, because the sun was setting. He found a stone there, used it for a pillow, and slept in that place for the night. 
01Gn 28:12 That night he had a dream! He saw a raised highway that had been built with its ending point on earth and its beginning point in heaven. God's angels were ascending and descending on it.
01Gn 28:13 And there was the Lord, standing above it and telling Jacob, "I am the Lord God of your grandfather Abraham. I'm Isaac's God, too. I'm giving you and your descendants the ground on which you're sleeping. 
01Gn 28:14 Your descendants are going to become like the dust of the earth and spread out to the west, east, north, and south. All the families of the earth will be blessed through you and your descendants. 
01Gn 28:15 Now pay attention! I'm here with you, and I'm going to be watching over you wherever you go. I'm going to bring you back to this land, because I won't ever leave you until I've accomplished what I've promised about you."
01Gn 28:16 Then Jacob woke up during the night and said to himself, "Surely, the Lord is in this place and I never knew it!" 
01Gn 28:17 In mounting terror, he cried out, "How scary this place is! This is nothing less than God's house and the gateway to heaven!" 
01Gn 28:18 When Jacob got up early the next morning, he took the stone that he had used for  his pillow, set it up as a pillar, drenched it in oil, 
01Gn 28:19 and named the place Beth-el, although previously the city had been named Luz.
01Gn 28:20 Then he made this solemn vow£º "If God remains with me, watches over me throughout this journey that I'm taking, gives me food to eat and clothes to wear, 
01Gn 28:21 and returns me safely to my father's house, then the Lord will be my God, 
01Gn 28:22 this stone that I've erected in the form of a pillar will be God's house, I'll give you a tenth of everything that you give to me."
01Gn 29:1 Jacob journeyed on and reached the territory that belonged to the people who lived in the east. 
01Gn 29:2 As he was observing a well that had been dug out on the open range, all of a sudden he noticed three flocks of sheep lying there, because shepherds watered their flocks from that well. There was a very large stone that covered the opening of the well, 
01Gn 29:3 and when all the flocks had been gathered there, they would roll away the stone from the opening of the well, water their flocks, and then return the stone to its place covering the opening of the well.
01Gn 29:4 Jacob asked them, "My brothers, where are you from?" "We're from Haran," they answered.
01Gn 29:5 "Do you happen to know Nahor's son Laban?" he inquired. "We do," they replied.
01Gn 29:6 So he asked them, "How's he doing?" "Very well," they answered. "As a matter of fact, look over there! That's his daughter Rachel, coming here with his sheep."
01Gn 29:7 "Look!" Jacob replied. "The sun is still high. It's not yet time for the flocks to be gathered. Let's water the sheep, then let them graze."
01Gn 29:8 But they responded, "We can't do that until all the sheep have been gathered and the stone has been rolled away from the opening of the well. Only then can we cause the flock to drink." 
01Gn 29:9 While he was still talking with them, Rachel arrived with his father's sheep, since she was a shepherdess.
01Gn 29:10 When Jacob saw Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother's brother, accompanied by Laban's sheep, Jacob approached the well, rolled the stone from the opening of the well, and then watered his mother's brother Laban's flock.
01Gn 29:11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel and began to cry out loud. 
01Gn 29:12 Jacob told Rachel that he was related to her father, since he was Rebekah's son, so she ran and told her father.
01Gn 29:13 When Laban heard the news about his sister's son Jacob, he ran out to meet him. He embraced him, kissed him, and brought him back to his house. Then Jacob told Laban about everything that had happened. 
01Gn 29:14 Laban responded, "You certainly are my flesh and blood!" So Jacob stayed with him for about a month.
01Gn 29:15 Later, Laban asked Jacob, "Should you serve me for free, just because you're my nephew -  Let's talk about what your wages should be."
01Gn 29:16 Now Laban happened to have two daughters. The older one was named Leah and the younger was named Rachel. 
01Gn 29:17 Leah looked rather plain, but Rachel was lovely in form and appearance. 
01Gn 29:18 Jacob loved Rachel, so he made this offer to Laban£º "I'll serve you for seven years for Rachel, your younger daughter."
01Gn 29:19 "It's better that I give her to you than to another man," Laban replied, "so stay with me." 
01Gn 29:20 Jacob served seven years for Rachel, but it seemed like only a few days because of his love for her.
01Gn 29:21 Eventually, Jacob told Laban, "Bring me my wife, now that my time of service has been completed, so I can go be with her." 
01Gn 29:22 So Laban gathered all the men who lived in that place and held a wedding feast.
01Gn 29:23 That night Laban took his daughter Leah and brought her to Jacob. He had marital relations with her. 
01Gn 29:24 Laban also gave his servant woman Zilpah to Leah to be her maidservant.
01Gn 29:25 The next morning, Jacob realized that it was Leah! "What have you done to me?" he demanded of Laban. "Didn't  I serve you for seven years in order to marry Rachel -  Why did you deceive me?"
01Gn 29:26 But Laban responded, "It's not the practice of our place to give the younger one in marriage before the first born. 
01Gn 29:27 Fulfill the week for this one, then we'll give you the other one in exchange for serving me another seven years."
01Gn 29:28 So Jacob completed another seven years' work, and then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel to be his wife. 
01Gn 29:29 Laban also gave his woman servant Bilhah to his daughter Rachel to be her maidservant. 
01Gn 29:30 Jacob also married Rachel, since he loved her. He served Laban another full seven years' work for Rachel.
01Gn 29:31 Later, the Lord noticed that Leah was being neglected, so he opened her womb, but Rachel remained childless. 
01Gn 29:32 Leah conceived, bore a son, and named him Reuben, because she was saying, "The Lord had looked on my affliction. So now, my husband will love me."
01Gn 29:33 Later, she conceived again, bore a son, and declared, "Because the Lord heard that I'm neglected, he gave me this one, too." So she named him Simeon.
01Gn 29:34 Later, she conceived again and said, "This time my husband will join himself with me, because I've borne him three sons." So he named him Levi.
01Gn 29:35 Then she conceived yet again, bore a son, and said, "This time I'll praise the Lord." So she named him Judah. Then she stopped bearing children.
01Gn 30:1 Rachel noticed that she was not bearing children for Jacob, so out of envy of her sister Leah, she said to Jacob, "If you don't give me sons, I'm going to die!"
01Gn 30:2 That made Jacob angry with Rachel, so he asked in response, "Can I take God's place, who has withheld from you fruit of the womb?"
01Gn 30:3 But she responded, "Here's my handmaid Bilhah. Go have sex with her. She can bear them on my knees so I can have children through her."
01Gn 30:4 So she gave Jacob her woman servant Bilhah to be his mistress, and Jacob had sex with her. 
01Gn 30:5 Bilhah conceived and bore a son for Jacob. 
01Gn 30:6 Then Rachel said, "God has judged me and has heard my voice. He gave me a son." Therefore, she named him Dan.
01Gn 30:7 Rachel's servant conceived again and bore a second son for Jacob, 
01Gn 30:8 so Rachel said, "I've been through a mighty struggle with my sister and won." She named him Naphtali.
01Gn 30:9 When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing children, she took her woman servant Zilpah and gave her to Jacob as a mistress. 
01Gn 30:10 Leah's servant Zilpah bore a son to Jacob, 
01Gn 30:11 and Leah remarked, "How fortunate!" So she named him Gad.
01Gn 30:12 Later, Leah's servant Zilpah bore a second son to Jacob. 
01Gn 30:13 She said, "How happy I am, because women will call me happy." So she named him Asher.
01Gn 30:14 Some time later, during the wheat harvest season, Reuben went out and found some mandrakes in the field and brought them back for his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, "Please give me your son's mandrakes."
01Gn 30:15 In response, Leah asked her, "Wasn't it enough that you've taken away my husband -  Now you also want to take my son's mandrakes!" But Rachel replied, "Okay, let's let Jacob sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son's mandrakes."
01Gn 30:16 When Jacob came from the field that evening, Leah went to meet him. Then she said, "You're having sex with me tonight. I traded my son's mandrakes for you!" So he slept with her that night.
01Gn 30:17 God heard what Leah had said, so she conceived and bore a fifth son for Jacob. 
01Gn 30:18 Then Leah said, "God has paid me for giving my servant to my husband as a mistress." So she named him Issachar.
01Gn 30:19 Later, Leah conceived again and bore a sixth son for Jacob. 
01Gn 30:20 Then Leah said, "God has given me a good gift. This time my husband will exalt me, because I've borne him six sons." So she named him Zebulun.
01Gn 30:21 After that, Leah conceived, bore a daughter, and named her Dinah. 
01Gn 30:22 Then God remembered Rachel. He listened to her and opened her womb, 
01Gn 30:23 so she conceived, bore a son, and remarked, "God has removed my shame." 
01Gn 30:24 Because she had been asking, "May God add another son for me," she named him Joseph.
01Gn 30:25 After Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, "Send me off so that I can go back to my place and country. 
01Gn 30:26 Give me my wives and children for whom I've served you. Then I'll leave, since you're aware of my service with which I've served you."
01Gn 30:27 Then Laban responded, "If I've found favor in your sight, please stay with me, because I've learned through divination that the Lord has blessed me because of you." 
01Gn 30:28 Name your wage," Laban added, "and I'll give it to you."
01Gn 30:29 But Jacob replied to Laban, "You know how I've served you and how your cattle thrived under my care. 
01Gn 30:30 What you had previously was only a few head, but the herd has now multiplied, because the Lord has blessed you through my efforts. But now, when am I going to be able to provide for my own household?"
01Gn 30:31 "What do I have to give you?" Laban asked. Jacob responded, "You don't have to give me anything. Just do this for me£º Let me tend your flock again and watch over it. 
01Gn 30:32 Let me walk among your flocks today and remove every speckled or spotted sheep, every black lamb, and let me do the same with the speckled and spotted goats. These will be my wages. 
01Gn 30:33 In times to come, you'll be able to verify my honesty because, when you come to check what I've earned, if you find a goat that's not speckled or spotted or a sheep that's not black, then it will have been stolen by me."
01Gn 30:34 "Okay," Laban replied. "We'll do it the way you've asked."
01Gn 30:35 That very day, Laban removed the male goats that were striped or spotted, all the female goats that were speckled or spotted - that is, every one that had white on them - and all the black lambs and placed them into the care of his sons. 
01Gn 30:36 He sent them as far away from Jacob as a three day's journey could take them. Meanwhile, Jacob kept tending the rest of Laban's flock. 
01Gn 30:37 Jacob took branches from white poplar trees, freshly cut almond trees, and some other trees, stripped off their bark to make white streaks, and uncovered the white part inside the branches. 
01Gn 30:38 Then he placed the branches that he had stripped bare in all the watering troughs where the flocks came to drink. He placed the branches in front of the flock, and they went into heat as they came to drink.
01Gn 30:39 When the flocks mated in front of the branches, they would bring forth offspring that were striped, speckled, or spotted.
01Gn 30:40 Jacob kept the lambs separate, facing the striped and entirely black ones that belonged to Laban's flock. He set his own herd by itself and would not let them be with Laban's flock. 
01Gn 30:41 Whenever the more vigorous of the flock came into heat, Jacob would place the branches in the troughs in front of the flock to make them mate by the branches.
01Gn 30:42 But he didn't put the branches in front of any of the feeble members of the flock. As a result, the feeble ones belonged to Laban, but the stronger ones belonged to Jacob. 
01Gn 30:43 Therefore the man prospered so much that he had large flocks, female and male servants, as well as camels and donkeys.
01Gn 31:1 Now Jacob used to listen while Laban's sons kept on complaining, "Jacob has taken over everything our father owns! He made himself wealthy from what belongs to our father!" 
01Gn 31:2 Jacob also noticed that the way Laban had been looking at him wasn't as nice as it had been just three days before.
01Gn 31:3 Then the Lord ordered Jacob, "Go back to your father's territory and to your relatives. I'll be with you."
01Gn 31:4 Jacob sent for Rachel and Leah to come out to the field where his flock was 
01Gn 31:5 and informed them, "I've noticed that the way your father has been looking at us hasn't been as nice as it was just a few days ago. But my father's God has been with me. 
01Gn 31:6 You know I've been serving your father with all my heart. 
01Gn 31:7 Even so, your father has cheated me. He broke our wage agreement ten times. However, God didn't allow him to harm me.
01Gn 31:8 "When Laban said, 'The speckled ones will be your wages,' then all the flock gave birth to speckled ones. Then when he said, 'The streaked ones will be your wages,' all the flock gave birth to streaked offspring.
01Gn 31:9 "So God has taken away your father's livestock and has given them to me. 
01Gn 31:10 As it was, when it was time for the livestock to breed, I once looked up in a dream, and the male goats that were mating with the flock were producing streaked, speckled, and spotted offspring.
01Gn 31:11 "Then the angel of God spoke to me in a dream, 'Jacob. "'Here I am,' I replied
01Gn 31:12 "'Look around!' he said. 'Go ahead, look! All the male goats have been mating with the flock, producing offspring that are streaked, speckled, and spotted, because I've been watching everything that Laban has done to you. 
01Gn 31:13 I am the God of Bethel, the place where you consecrated that stone and made a vow to me. Now get up, leave this territory, and return to your native land.'"
01Gn 31:14 Then Rachel and Leah asked him, "Do we have anything left of inheritance remaining in our father's house -  
01Gn 31:15 He's treating us like foreigners. He sold us and spent all of the money that rightfully belonged to us. 
01Gn 31:16 Furthermore, all of the wealth that God has stripped away from our father belongs to us now and to our children. So do everything that God tells you to do."
01Gn 31:17 So Jacob got up, seated his children and wives on camels, 
01Gn 31:18 and drove all his livestock ahead of him, with everything that belonged to him, including the livestock that he had bought and accumulated in Paddan-Aram, intending to deliver them to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan. 
01Gn 31:19 Meanwhile, Laban had been out shearing his sheep. While he was away, Rachel stole her father's teraphim. 
01Gn 31:20 Moreover, Jacob had deceived Laban the Syrian, because he had never told him that he was intending to leave. 
01Gn 31:21 Jacob fled, taking everything that he owned. He got up, crossed the Jordan river, and headed toward the hill country of Gilead. 
01Gn 31:22 Three days later, somebody reported to Laban that Jacob had fled, 
01Gn 31:23 so he took his relatives with him and pursued Jacob. Laban was on the road for seven days when he finally caught up with Jacob in the hill country of Gilead.
01Gn 31:24 That night, God appeared to Laban the Syrian in a dream and warned him, "Be careful what you say to Jacob, whether it's one word good or bad." 
01Gn 31:25 Meanwhile, Jacob had pitched his tent on the mountain, where Laban had caught up with him. Laban and his relatives encamped on that same mountain in the hill country of Gilead, too.
01Gn 31:26 Then Laban asked Jacob, "What did you do -  You deceived me, carried off my daughters like you would war captives, 
01Gn 31:27 ran away from me secretly, and stole from me by not letting me know. Otherwise, I could have sent you off with a party and singing, accompanied by a band playing tambourines and harps. 
01Gn 31:28 As it is, you didn't even allow me to kiss my grandchildren and daughters goodbye! You've acted foolishly. 
01Gn 31:29 It's actually in my power to do some serious evil to you, but last night, the God of your father said to me, 'Be careful of what you say to Jacob whether good or evil.' 
01Gn 31:30 Now, you can go if you must go, because you certainly are longing to go to your father's house. But why did you steal my gods?"
01Gn 31:31 "I was afraid," Jacob replied. "I thought you might separate your daughters from me. 
01Gn 31:32 Now as to your gods, if you find someone has them in their possession, he's a dead man. Go with our relatives, search through our belongings, and take whatever belongs to you that's with me." But Jacob didn't know that Rachel had stolen them. 
01Gn 31:33 So Laban entered Jacob's tent, Leah's tent, and the tents of the two maid servants, but he didn't find them. Then he left Leah's tent and entered Rachel's tent.
01Gn 31:34 Meanwhile, Rachel had taken the teraphim, placed them inside the camel's saddle, and sat on them. Laban searched through the whole tent, but found nothing. 
01Gn 31:35 Then Rachel said to her father, "Sir, please don't be angry that I cannot stand up in your presence. It's that time of the month." So he searched for - but never did find - the teraphim.
01Gn 31:36 Then Jacob got angry and started an argument with Laban. "What have I done?" he demanded. "What's my crime that you would cause you to come pursue me so violently -  
01Gn 31:37 Now that you've searched all my properties, what did you find that belong to your house -  Set it here before our relatives and we'll let them judge between us!
01Gn 31:38 "Meanwhile, these past 20 years that I've been with you, your sheep and goats never had miscarriages, I never once ate any of the rams from your flock, 
01Gn 31:39 and whatever was torn by beasts, I never bothered to bring to you. Instead, I bore the losses myself. Even so, you demanded that I provide restitution for anything what was stolen, whether during the day or the night.
01Gn 31:40 "As it was, I was attacked by drought during the day and by cold at night. I never got any decent rest. 
01Gn 31:41 I've been in your house these 20 years - serving fourteen years for your two daughters and another six years for your flocks. During all that time you changed my wages ten times. 
01Gn 31:42 If the God of my father - the God of Abraham, the God whom Isaac feared - had not been with me, you would have sent me away empty handed. But God saw my misery and the labor of my hands and rebuked you last night." 
01Gn 31:43 But Laban answered Jacob. "These women are my daughters. These children are my children. The flocks are mine. In fact, everything that you see belongs to me. But what would I do today to my daughters and the children they have borne -  
01Gn 31:44 Come, let's make a covenant. Just between you and me. And let it serve as a witness between you and me."
01Gn 31:45 So Jacob took a stone and raised it as a pillar. 
01Gn 31:46 Then Jacob said to his relatives, "Go gather some stones." So they picked up stones and stacked them one on the other to form a stack. Then they had a meal together there by the stack of stones. 
01Gn 31:47 Laban named the place Jegar-sahadutha, but Jacob named it Galeed.
01Gn 31:48 Then Laban said, "This stack will serve a witness between you and me today." That's how the place came to be named Galeed. 
01Gn 31:49 It was also called Mizpah, because he said, "May the Lord watch between you and me, when we are estranged from each other. 
01Gn 31:50 If you mistreat my daughters or if you take other wives besides them, though no one is with us, keep in mind that God stands as a witness between you and me."
01Gn 31:51 "Look!" Laban added, "Here is the stack of stones and here is the pillar that I've set up between you and me. 
01Gn 31:52 This stack is a witness, and so is this pillar, reminding me not to cross beyond this stack of stones, and reminding you not to pass by this stack in my direction, intending to cause harm. 
01Gn 31:53 May Abraham's God and Nahor's god judge between us." So Jacob made an oath by his father's Fear, 
01Gn 31:54 offered sacrifices there on the mountain, and called on his relatives to eat some food. So they ate the food and spent the night on the mountain. 
01Gn 31:55 Early the next morning, Laban woke up, kissed his grandchildren and daughters, blessed them, and then left for home.
01Gn 32:1 As Jacob went on his way, angels from God met him. 
01Gn 32:2 As he was watching them, Jacob said, "This must be God's camp," so he named that place Mahanaim.
01Gn 32:3 Then Jacob sent messengers ahead of him into the land of Seir (that is, into the territory of Edom) to meet his brother Esau. 
01Gn 32:4 He instructed them, "This is what you are to say to my master Esau£º 'Your servant Jacob said to tell you, "I've journeyed to stay with Laban and I've remained there until now. 
01Gn 32:5 I now have cattle, donkeys, flocks, and male and female servants. I'm sending this message to my lord, so that you'll show favor to me."'"
01Gn 32:6 Later, the messengers returned to Jacob and reported, "We went to your brother Esau. He's now coming to meet you. He has 400 men with him!"
01Gn 32:7 In mounting terror and distress, Jacob divided the people who were with him into two companies, doing the same with the flocks, the cattle, and the camels. 
01Gn 32:8 Jacob was thinking, "If Esau comes to one company and attacks it, then the remaining company may escape."
01Gn 32:9 Then Jacob prayed, "O God of my father Abraham, O God of my father Isaac, O Lord, you who said to me, 'Return to your country and to your relatives and I'll cause things to go well for you.' 
01Gn 32:10 I'm unworthy of all your gracious love, your faithfulness, and everything that you've done for your servant. When I first crossed over this Jordan River, I had only my staff. But now I've become two companies. 
01Gn 32:11 Deliver me from my brother's control, from Esau, because I'm terrified of him, I fear that he's coming to attack me, the mothers, and their children. 
01Gn 32:12 Now, you promised me that 'I'm certainly going to cause things to go well with you, and I'm going to make your offspring like the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered.'"
01Gn 32:13 Jacob spent the night there. Out of everything that he had brought with him, he chose a gift for his brother Esau -  
01Gn 32:14 200 female goats, 20 male goats, 200 ewes, 20 rams, 
01Gn 32:15 30 milking camels with their young, 40 cows with ten bulls, and 20 female donkeys with ten male donkeys. 
01Gn 32:16 He entrusted them into the care of his servants, one herd at a time. Then he said to his servants, "Go in front of me, making sure there's set a space between herds."13
01Gn 32:17 To the first group he said, "When you meet my brother Esau, if he asks, 'To whom do you belong -  Where are you going -  And to whom do these herds belong?' 
01Gn 32:18 then you are to reply, "To your servant Jacob. They are a gift. He's sending them to my master, Esau. Look! There he is, coming along behind us."
01Gn 32:19 He issued similar instructions to the second and third group, as well as to all the others who drove the herds who followed£º "This is how you are to speak to Esau when you find him. 
01Gn 32:20 You are to tell him, 'Look! Your servant Jacob is coming along behind us.'" Jacob was thinking, "I'll pacify him with the presents that are being sent ahead of me. Then, when I meet him, perhaps he'll accept me.'" 
01Gn 32:21 So the presents went ahead of him, while he spent that night in the camp. 
01Gn 32:22 Later that night, he woke up, quickly took his two wives, two women servants, and his eleven children, and forded the river at Jabbok. 
01Gn 32:23 He took them across the river, along with all his possessions.
01Gn 32:24 And so Jacob was left alone, and he struggled with a man with him as daybreak approached. 
01Gn 32:25 When the man realized that he hadn't yet won the struggle, he injured the socket of Jacob's thigh, dislocating it as he wrestled with him, 
01Gn 32:26 and said, "Let me go, because the dawn has come." "I won't let you go," he replied, "unless you bless me."
01Gn 32:27 Then he asked him, "What's your name?" "Jacob," he responded
01Gn 32:28 But in response, he said, "Your name is not to be called Jacob anymore, but Israel, because you exerted yourself against both God and men, and you've emerged victorious."
01Gn 32:29 "Please," Jacob inquired. "Tell me your name." But in reply he asked, "For what purpose are you asking about my name?" And he blessed Jacob there.
01Gn 32:30 Jacob would later call that place Peniel, because "I saw God face to face, but my life was spared."
01Gn 32:31 The sun was rising above him as he crossed over from Peniel, limping due to his wounded thigh. 
01Gn 32:32 Therefore, to this day the Israelites do not eat the hip tendon that connects to the thigh socket, because he had injured the socket of the thigh where the tendon connected to Jacob's hip.
01Gn 33:1 When Jacob looked off in the distance, there was Esau! And he was coming toward him, accompanied by 400 men! So Jacob divided the children of Leah, Rachel, and the children of the two servants into separate groups. 
01Gn 33:2 Then he positioned the women servants and their children first, then Leah and her children next, and then Rachel and Joseph after them.
01Gn 33:3 Then he went out to meet Esau, passing in front of all of them, and prostrated himself to the ground seven times as he approached his brother. 
01Gn 33:4 Esau ran to meet Jacob and embraced him. Then he fell on his neck and kissed him. And they wept.
01Gn 33:5 When Esau eventually looked around, he saw the women and the children. So he asked, "Who are these people with you?" "The children, whom God has graciously given your servant," he answered. 
01Gn 33:6 Then the women servants approached, accompanied by their children, and bowed low.
01Gn 33:7 Leah also approached, ands he and her children bowed low. Afterthis, Joseph and Rachel approached and bowed low.
01Gn 33:8 Then Esau asked, "What are all these livestock for?" "To solicit favor from your eyes, my lord," Jacob answered.
01Gn 33:9 But Esau replied, "I already have so much, my brother, so keep what belongs to you."
01Gn 33:10 "Please," Jacob implored him, "don't refuse. If I'm to receive favor from you, then receive this gift from me, because seeing your face is like seeing the face of God, since you have favorably accepted me. 
01Gn 33:11 So receive my blessing, which has been sent to you, since God has been gracious to me. Besides, I have enough."Because Jacob kept pressing him, Esau received the gifts.
01Gn 33:12 Then Esau suggested, "Let's set out and travel together, but let me go in front of you.
01Gn 33:13 "My lord knows that the children are tender," Jacob added, "and the ewe and the cows with me are nursing their young. If they're driven even for a day, the entire flock will die. 
01Gn 33:14 So let my lord go ahead of his servant while I travel gently, letting the herds set their own pace with the children until I arrive to see my lord in Seir." 33
01Gn 33:15 Esau said, "Let me leave with you some of the people who are with me." "Why do that?" Jacob asked. "I've already found favor in your sight, my lord." 
01Gn 33:16 So Esau set out that very day back on his way to Seir, 
01Gn 33:17 but Jacob set out for Succoth, built a house there, and constructed some booths for his cattle. He named the place Succoth.
01Gn 33:18 After he had arrived safely from Paddan-Aram, Jacob entered the city of Shechem, which was located in the territory of Canaan, and encamped facing that city. 
01Gn 33:19 Then he bought a parcel of land for 100 pieces of silver from the descendants of Hamor, She chem's father. He pitched his tent there,
01Gn 33:20 set up an altar, and named it El-Elohe-Israel. 33
01Gn 34:1 Some time later, Dinah, Leah's daughter whom she has borne to Jacob, went out to visit the women of the land. 
01Gn 34:2 When Hamor the Hivite's son Shechem, the regional leader, saw her, he grabbed her and raped her, humiliating her. 
01Gn 34:3 He was attached to Dinah, Jacob's daughter, since he loved the young woman and spoke tenderly to her. 
01Gn 34:4 Then he told his father Hamor, "Get for me this young woman for my wife."
01Gn 34:5 Because Jacob learned that Shechem had dishonored his daughter Dinah while his sons were still out with their cattle on the open range, he remained silent until they returned. 
01Gn 34:6 Meanwhile, She chem's father Hamor arrived to talk to Jacob.
01Gn 34:7 Just then Jacob's sons arrived from the field. When they heard what had happened, they were distraught with grief and livid with anger toward the man, because he has committed a disgraceful deed in Israel by forcing Jacob's daughter to have sex, an act that never should have happened.
01Gn 34:8 But Hamor said this£º "My son is deeply attached to your daughter. Please give her to him as his wife. 
01Gn 34:9 Intermarry with us. Give your daughters to us and take our sons for yourselves.
01Gn 34:1 0Live with us, since the land lays open before you. Live, trade, and grow rich in it."
01Gn 34:1 1Shechem also addressed her father and brothers, saying to them, "If you'll just approve me, I'll give whatever you ask of me. 
01Gn 34:1 2No matter how big or how extensive your demands are for a dowry and wedding presents from me, I'll provide whatever you ask. Only give me the young lady to be my wife."
01Gn 34:1 3But Jacob's sons answered Shechem and his father Hamor deceptively, because Shechem had dishonored their sister Dinah. 
01Gn 34:1 4They said to them. "We can't do this. We can't give our sister to a man who isn't circumcised, because tha twould be insulting to us.
01Gn 34:1 5But we'll agree to your request, only if you will become like us by circumcising every male among you.
01Gn 34:1 6Then we'll give our daughters to you and take your daughters for ourselves, live among you, and be as a united people.
01Gn 34:1 7But if you won't listen to us, then we're going to take our daughter and leave."1What they said pleased Hamor and his son Shechem, 
01Gn 34:19 so the young man did not delay the matter any further, since he was delighted with Jacob's daughter. Moreover, he was the most important person in his father's house hold.
01Gn 34:20 So Hamor and his son Shechem entered the gate of their city and addressed the men of their city. 
01Gn 34:21 "These men are a tpeace with us," they announced. "Therefore, let them live in the land and trade in it. Look! The land is large enough for them. Let's take their daughters as wives for ourselves and let's give our sons to them.
01Gn 34:22 "However," they added, "only on this condition will the men consent to live with us and be united as a single people with us£º every male among us will have to be circumcised just as they are. 
01Gn 34:23 Shouldn't all their cattle, acquisitions, and animals belong to us -  So, let's give our consent to them, and then they'll live with us."
01Gn 34:24 All of the males who heard Hamor and his son Shechem, who had gone out to the city gate, were circumcised. 
01Gn 34:25 Three days later, while they were still in pain, Jacob's sons Simeon and Levi, two of Dinah's brothers, each grabbed a sword and entered the city unannounced, intending to kill all the males.
01Gn 34:26 They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with theirs words, took back Dinah from Shechem's house, and left.
01Gn 34:27 Jacob's other sons came along afterward and plundered the city where their sister had been defiled, 
01Gn 34:28 seizing all o ftheir flocks, herds, asses, and whatever else was in the city or had been left ou tin the field.
01Gn 34:29 They carried off all their wealth, their children, and their wives as captives, plundering everything that remained in the houses.
01Gn 34:30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, "You have certainly stirred up trouble for me! You've made me stink in the opinion of the Canaanites and the Perrizites who live in this territory. Because I have only a few men with me, they're going to gather themselves together and attack me until I am totally destroyed, along with my entire household!"
01Gn 34:31 "Should he have treated our sister like a whore?" they asked in response.
01Gn 35:1 Later, God told Jacob, "Get up, move to Bethel, and live there. Build an altar to the God who appeared to you when you were fleeing from your brother Esau."
01Gn 35:2 Jacob announced to his household and to everyone with him, "Throw away the foreign gods that you've kept among you, purify yourselves, and change your clothes. 
01Gn 35:3 Then let's get up and go to Bethel, where I'll build an altar to the God who answered me when I was in distress and who was with me on the road, wherever I went."
01Gn 35:4 So they handed over to Jacob all their foreign gods on which they had been depending, along with the rings that they were wearing on their ears. Jacob buried them under the oak that grew near Shechem. 
01Gn 35:5 As they set out on their journey, because the cities around them feared God, they did not pursue Jacob's sons.
01Gn 35:6 Eventually, Jacob and everyone with him arrived at Luz (also called Beth-el) in the territory of Canaan. 
01Gn 35:7 He built an altar there to God and named the place ElBeth-el, because God had revealed himself there when he was fleeing from his brother.
01Gn 35:8 Rebekah's nurse Deborah died and was buried there, under the oak tree that was below Beth-el. That's why the place was named "Weeping Oak".
01Gn 35:9 Later, God appeared to Jacob after he had arrived from Paddan-Aram and blessed him.
01Gn 35:10 Then God said to him, "Your name is Jacob. No longer are you to be called Jacob. Instead, your name will be Israel." So God called his name Israel 
01Gn 35:11 and also said to him, "I am God Almighty. You are to be fruitful and multiply. You will become a nation - in fact, an assembly of nations! Kings will come from you - they'll emerge from your own loins!
01Gn 35:12 Now as for the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I'm giving it to you and to your descendants after you I'm giving the land to you!"
01Gn 35:13 After this, God ascended from the place where he had been speaking to him. 
01Gn 35:14 Jacob erected a pillar of stone at that very place where God had spoken to him. He poured a drink offering over it, anointed it with oil,
01Gn 35:15 and named the place where God had spoken to him Beth-el.
01Gn 35:16 Later, they set out from Beth-el. While still a long way from Ephrathah, Rachel started to have trouble giving birth. 
01Gn 35:17 While she was suffering due to her difficult labor, the midwife told her, "Don't fear! You're going to have another son."
01Gn 35:18 As her soul was beginning to leave as she was dying, she called his name Ben-oni, but his father named him Benjamin. 
01Gn 35:19 So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrathah, also known as Bethlehem.
01Gn 35:20 Jacob erected a pillar over her grave, and that pillar over Rachel's grave is there to this day.
01Gn 35:21 Jacob continued his travels, and eventually pitched his tent facing Migdal Eder. 
01Gn 35:22 But while Israel lived in that land, Reuben went in and had sexual relations with his father's concubine Bilhah, and Israel heard about it. Now Jacob had twelve sons. 
01Gn 35:23 Leah's sons were Reuben (Jacob's first-born), Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun. 
01Gn 35:24 Rachel's sons were Joseph and Benjamin.
01Gn 35:25 Rachel's servant Bilhah's sons were Dan and Naphtali.
01Gn 35:26 Leah's servant Zilpah's sons were Gad and Asher. These were Jacob's sons who were born to him while he lived in Paddan-Aram.
01Gn 35:27 So Jacob reached his father Isaac at Mamre, in Kiriath-arba (also known as Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had lived. 
01Gn 35:28 Isaac had lived a total of 180 years
01Gn 35:29 when he died and was gathered to his ancestors at a ripe old age. His sons Esau and Jacob buried him. 
01Gn 36:1 This is a record of Esau's genealogy, that is, of Edom. 
01Gn 36:2 Esau had married Canaanite women, including£º Elon the Hittite's daughter Adah, Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, who was Zibeon the Hivite's daughter, and 
01Gn 36:3 Ishamael's daughter Basemath, who was Nebaioth's sister.
01Gn 36:4 Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, Basemath bore Reuel, and 
01Gn 36:5 Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were Esau's sons, who were born to him in the territory of Canaan.
01Gn 36:6 Later, Esau took his wives, his children, everyone in his household, his livestock, all his animals, and all his possessions that he had acquired in the territory of Canaan and moved far away from his brother Jacob, 
01Gn 36:7 because their holdings were too vast to allow them to stay together, since the land where they had settled was not able to support all of their livestock.
01Gn 36:8 So Esau lived in Mount Seir. That same Esau is Edom.
01Gn 36:9 This is a record of the family history of Esau, the ancestor of the Edomites of Mount Seir. 
01Gn 36:10 The names of Esau's sons were Eliphaz(the son of Esau's wife Adah) and Reuel(the son of Esau's wife Basemath).
01Gn 36:11 Eliphaz's sons were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 
01Gn 36:12 Timnah was aconcubine of Esau's son Eliphaz. She bore Amalek to Eliphaz.
01Gn 36:13 Reuel's sons were Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the sons of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:14 These were the sons of Esau's wife Oholibamah, the daughter of Anah, who was the daughter of Zibeon. She bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah for Esau.
01Gn 36:15 These were the tribal leaders of Esau's descendants, the sons of Eliphaz, who was Esau's firstborn£º tribal leaders Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 
01Gn 36:16 Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These were the tribal leaders who descended from Eliphaz in the territory of Edom. These were Adah's sons.
01Gn 36:17 These were the descendants of Esau's son Reuel£º tribal leaders Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These were the tribal leaders who descended from Reuel in the territory of Edom. These were the sons of Esau's wife Basemath.
01Gn 36:18 These were the descendants of Esau's wife Oholibamah£º tribal leaders Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These were the tribal leaders who descended from Oholibamah, the daughter of Esau's wife Anah. 
01Gn 36:19 These were the descendants of Esau(also known as Edom) and their tribal leaders.
01Gn 36:20 These were the descendants of Seir the Horite, who lived in the territory£º Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
01Gn 36:21 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the tribal leaders who descended from the Horites, the descendants of Seir in the territory of Edom.
01Gn 36:22 Lotan's children were Hori and Hemam. Lotan's sister was Timna. 
01Gn 36:23 Shobal's children were Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam.
01Gn 36:24 Zibeon's children were Aiah and Anah. Anah discovered the hot springs in the wilderness while grazing his father Zibeon's donkeys.
01Gn 36:25 Anah's children were Dishon and her daughter Oholibamah.
01Gn 36:26 Dishon's children were Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Keran.
01Gn 36:27 Ezer's children were Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan.
01Gn 36:28 Dishan's children were Uz and Aran.
01Gn 36:29 These were the tribal leaders who descended from the Horites£º tribal leaders Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 
01Gn 36:30 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These were the tribal leaders who descended from the Horites, according to their tribal leader sin the territory of Seir.
01Gn 36:31 This is a list of the kings who ruled the territory of Edom before any king reigned over the Israelites. 
01Gn 36:32 Beor's son Bela ruled over Edom. His city's name was Dinhabah.
01Gn 36:33 After Bela died, Zerah's son Jobab from Bozrah ruled in his place.
01Gn 36:34 After Jobab died, Husham from the territory of the Temanites ruled in his place.
01Gn 36:35 After Husham died, Bedad's son Hadad, who killed Midian in the field of Moab, ruled in his place. His city's name was Avith.
01Gn 36:36 After Hadad died Samlah from Masrekah ruled in his place.
01Gn 36:37 After Samlah died, Shaul from Rehoboth by the River ruled in his place.
01Gn 36:38 After Shaul died, Achbor's son Baal-hanan ruled in his place.
01Gn 36:39 After Achbor's son Baal-hanan died, Hadar ruled in his place. His city's name was Pau. And his wife's name was Mehetabel, who was the daughter of Matred, and granddaughter of Me-zahab.
01Gn 36:40 These were the names of the chiefs who descended from Esau according to their clans, territories, and names£º tribal leaders Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 
01Gn 36:41 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 
01Gn 36:42 Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 
01Gn 36:43 Magdiel, and Iram. These were the chiefs who descended from Edom, according to their territories in their own land. This was Esau's dynasty, who was the ancestor of the Edomites.
01Gn 37:1 Jacob continued to live in the land they were occupying, where his father had journeyed in the territory of Canaan. 
01Gn 37:2 This is a record regarding Jacob's generation. At the age of seventeen years, Joseph was helping his brothers tend the flocks. He was a young man at that time, as were the children of Bilhah and Zilpah his father's wives. But Joseph brought evil reports concerning them to their father.
01Gn 37:3 Now Israel loved Joseph more than all his brothers, since he was born to him in his old age, so he had made a richly-embroidered tunic for him. 
01Gn 37:4 When his brothers realized that their father loved him more than all of his brothers, they hated him so much that they were un able to speak politely to him.
01Gn 37:5 Right about this time, Joseph had a dream and then told it to his brothers. As a result, his brothers hated him all the more! 
01Gn 37:6 "Listen to this dream that I dreamed!, he said.
01Gn 37:7 "We were tying sheaves together out in the middle of the fields, when all of a sudden, my sheaf stood up erect! And then your sheaves gathered around it and bowed down to my sheaf!"
01Gn 37:8 At this, his brothers replied, "Do you really think you're going to rule us or lord it over us?" So they hated him all the more because of his dreams and his interpretations.
01Gn 37:9 But then he had one more dream that he also related to his brothers. "I had another dream," he said. "The sun, moon, and eleven of the stars were bowing down before me!"
01Gn 37:1 0When he his father about this, his father rebuked him and asked him, "What's this dream that you had -  Shall I, your mother, and your brothers really come to you and bow down to the ground in front of you?" 
01Gn 37:1 1As a result, his brothers became more envious of him. But his father kept thinking about all of this.
01Gn 37:1 2Some time later, his brothers left to tend their father's flock in Shechem. 
01Gn 37:1 3And Israel instructed Joseph, "Your brothers are tending the flock in Shechem. Come here, because I'm going to send you to them." "Here I am! he responded.
01Gn 37:1 4"Go and see how things are with your brothers," he ordered him. "And see how things are with the flock. Bring back a report for me." So he sent him from the valley of Hebron. When Joseph reached Shechem, 
01Gn 37:1 5a man found him wandering around in a field. So the man asked him, "What are you looking for?"
01Gn 37:1 6"I'm searching for my brothers," he responded. "Tell me, where are they tending the flock?"
01Gn 37:1 7Then the man responded, "They've already left. I heard them saying that they were headed to Dothan." So Joseph followed his brothers to Dothan and found them there.
01Gn 37:18 Now as soon as they saw him approaching from a distance, before he arrived they plotted together to kill him. 
01Gn 37:19 "Look!"they said. "Here comes the Dream Master!
01Gn 37:20 Come on! Let's kill him and throw him in one of the cisterns. Then we'll report that some wild animal devoured him and wait to see what becomes of his dreams!
01Gn 37:21 When Reuben heard it, he tried to save him from their plot. "Let's not do any killing," 
01Gn 37:22 Reuben said to them. "And no blood shedding, either. Instead, let's toss him into this cistern that's way out here in the wilderness. But don't lay a hand on him¡¦" Reuben intended to deliver Joseph from their control and return him to his father.
01Gn 37:23 As it was, when Joseph arrived where his brothers were, they stripped off the tunic that Joseph had given him, that is, the richly-embroidered tunic that he was wearing. 
01Gn 37:24 Then they seized him and tossed him into the cistern. But the cistern was empty. There was no water in it.
01Gn 37:25 After this, while they were seated, eating their food, they looked around and saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead with camels carrying spices, balm and myrrh for sale down in Egypt.
01Gn 37:26 Then Judah suggested to his brothers, "Where's the profit in just killing our brother and spilling his blood -  
01Gn 37:27 Come on! Let's sell him to the Ishmaelites! That way, we won't have laid our hand son him. After all, he's our brother, our own flesh." So his brothers listened to him. 
01Gn 37:28 As the Midianite merchants were passing through, they extracted Joseph from the cistern and sold Joseph for 20 pieces of silver to the Ishmaelites, who then took Joseph down to Egypt.
01Gn 37:29 Later, when Reuben returned to the cistern, Joseph wasn't in the cistern! In mounting panic, he tore his clothes, 
01Gn 37:30 returned to his brothers, and shouted, "He's not there! What now -  Where am I to go?"
01Gn 37:31 So they took Joseph's coat, slaughtered a young goat, and dipped the coat in the blood. 
01Gn 37:32 Thentheystretchedouttherichly-embroideredtunic to dry, and brought it to their father. "We've found this," they reported. "Look now and see if this is or isn't your son's tunic."
01Gn 37:33 Examining it, he cried out, "It's my son's tunic! A wild animal has no doubt torn Joseph to pieces."
01Gn 37:34 So Jacob tore his clothes, dressed himself in sackcloth, and then mourned many days for his son. 
01Gn 37:35 Allhissonsanddaughtersshowed up to comfort him, but he refused to be comforted. He kept saying, "Leave me alone! I'll go down to the next world, still mourning for my son." So his father wept for him.
01Gn 37:36 Meanwhile, down in Egypt, the Midianites sold Joseph to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's court officials who was also commander-in-chief of the imperial guards. 
01Gn 38:1 Right about then, Judah left his brothers and went to live with an Adullamite man named Hirah. 
01Gn 38:2 There Judah met the daughter of a Canaanite man named Shua. He married her, had sexual relations with her, 
01Gn 38:3 and she conceived, bore a son, and named him Er.
01Gn 38:4 Later, she conceived again, bore a son, and named him Onan.
01Gn 38:5 Then she bore yet another son and named him Shelah. Judah was living in Kezib when she bore him.
01Gn 38:6 Judah found a wife for his oldest son Er. Her name was Tamar. 
01Gn 38:7 But Er, Judah's oldest son was wicked in the sight of the Lord, so the Lord put him to death.
01Gn 38:8 So Judah instructed Onan, "You are to have sexual relations with your dead brother's wife, performing the duty of a brother-in-law with her, and raise up offspring for your brother."
01Gn 38:9 But Onan knew that the offspring wouldn't be his own heir, so whenever he had sexual relations with his brother's wife, he would spill his semen to the ground to avoid generating offspring for his brother. 
01Gn 38:10 What he did was evil in the sight of the Lord, so the Lord slew him, too.
01Gn 38:11 After this, Judah told his daughter-in-law Tamar, "Come and live as a widow in your father's house until my son Shelah grows up." But he was really thinking, "¡¦otherwise, he might die like his brothers." So Tamar left and lived in her father's house.
01Gn 38:12 Some years later, Shua's daughter, that is, Judah's wife, died. As Judah was grieving, he visited the shearers of his flock in Timnah, accompanied by his Adullamite friend Hirah.
01Gn 38:13 "Look!" somebody reported to Tamar, "Your father-in-law is going to Timnah to shear his sheep." 
01Gn 38:14 So she took off her mourning apparel, covered herself with a shawl, and concealed her outward appearance. Then she went out and sat at the entrance of Enaim, which is on the way to Timnah, because she knew that even though Shelah had grown up, she wasn't being given to him as his wife.13
01Gn 38:15 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a prostitute, since she had concealed her face. 
01Gn 38:16 So on the way, he turned aside, approached her, and said,"Come on! Let's have some sex!" But he didn't realize that she was talking to his own daughter-in-law. "What will you give me," she asked, "in order to have sex with me?"
01Gn 38:17 "I'll send you a young goat from the flock," he responded. But she pressed him, asking, "What security will you put up until you've sent it?"
01Gn 38:18 Then he asked, "What pledge do you want me to give you?" "Your signet ring, cord, and the staff in your hand," she countered. So he gave them to her, had sex with her, and she became pregnant by him. 
01Gn 38:19 Then she got up and left. Later, she took off her shawl and put on her mourning clothes.
01Gn 38:20 Later on, Judah sent his Adullamite friend to take her a young goat, intending to retrieve what he had put up as security from the woman, but he could not find her. 
01Gn 38:21 He asked the men who lived in that area, "Where's that temple prostitute who was sitting alongside the road at Enaim?" But they replied, "There's been no temple prostitute here."
01Gn 38:22 So he returned to Judah and said, "I haven't found her. Also, the men who are from there said, 'There's been no prostitute here.'"
01Gn 38:23 Then Judah said, "Let her have them. Otherwise, we'll become contemptible. I sent this young goat, but you didn't find her."
01Gn 38:24 Three months later, it was reported to Judah, "Your daughter-in-law Tamar has been sleeping around! And look! She's pregnant on account of her prostitution." "Bring her out," Judah responded. "Let's burn her to death!" 
01Gn 38:25 While they were bringing her out, she sent this message to her father-in-law£º  "I am pregnant by the man to whom these belong. Furthermore," she added, "tell me to whom this signet ring, cord, and staff belongs."
01Gn 38:26 When Judah recognized them, he admitted, "She is more upright than I, because I never did give her my son Shelah." And he never had sex with her again.
01Gn 38:27 Later, when it was time for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb! 
01Gn 38:28 While she was giving birth, one of them put out his hand, so the midwife grabbed it and tied something scarlet around his hand saying, "This one came out first."
01Gn 38:29 As it was, he withdrew his hand, and then his brother was born. Amazed, she cried out loud, "What's this -  A breach birth?" So he was named Perez. 
01Gn 38:30 Afterwards, his brother came out, and around his hand was the scarlet. So they called him Zerah.
01Gn 39:1 Meanwhile, Joseph had been delivered to Egypt and turned over to Potiphar, one of Pharaoh's court officials and the commander-in-chief of the imperial guards. An Egyptian, he bought Joseph from the Ishmaelites, who had brought him down there.
01Gn 39:2 But the Lord was with Joseph. He became a very prosperous man while in the house of his Egyptian master. 
01Gn 39:3 His master could see that the Lord was with him, because the Lord made everything that he did prosper. 
01Gn 39:4 That's how Joseph found favor in his sight as he ministered to him. Eventually, Potiphar appointed Joseph overseer of his entire household. Moreover, he entrusted everything that he owned into his responsibility.
01Gn 39:5 From the time he appointed Joseph to be overseer over his entire household and everything that he owned, the Lord blessed the household of the Egyptian because of Joseph. The blessing of the Lord rested on him, whether in Potiphar's household or in Potiphar's fields. 
01Gn 39:6 Everything that he owned, he entrusted into Joseph's care. He never worried about anything, except for the food he ate. Now Joseph was well built and handsome in appearance. 
01Gn 39:7 That's why, some time later, Joseph's master's wife looked straight at Joseph and propositioned him£º "Come on! Let's have a little sex!"
01Gn 39:8 But he refused. He replied to his master's wife, "Look! My master doesn't have to worry about anything in the house with me in charge, and he has entrusted everything into my charge. 
01Gn 39:9 No one has more authority in this house than I do. He has withheld nothing from me, except you, and that's because you're his wife. So how can I do this great evil -  How can I sin against God - 
01Gn 39:10 She kept on talking to him like this day after day, but he wouldn't listen to her. Not only would he refuse to have sex with her, he refused even to stay around her. 
01Gn 39:11 One day, though, he went into the house to do his work. None of the household servants were inside, 
01Gn 39:12 so she grabbed him by his outer garment and demanded "Let's have some sex!" Instead, Joseph ran outside, leaving his outer garment still in her hand. 
01Gn 39:13 When she realized that he had left his outer garment right there in her hand, she ran outside 
01Gn 39:14 and yelled for her household servants. "Look!" she cried out. "He has brought in a Hebrew man to humiliate us. He came in to have sex with me, but I screamed out loud! 
01Gn 39:15 When he heard that I was raising my voice to scream, he left his outer garment with me and fled outside."1439
01Gn 39:16 She kept his outer garment by her side until Joseph's master came home, 
01Gn 39:17 and then she told him these words£º "That Hebrew slave whom you brought to us came in here to rape me. 
01Gn 39:18 But when I raised my voice and screamed, he left his outer garment with me and ran outside."
01Gn 39:19 When Joseph's master heard that his wife was saying words to the effect that "This is how your servant treated me," he flew into a rage, 
01Gn 39:20 arrested Joseph, and locked him up in the same prison where the king's prisoners were confined. So Joseph remained there in prison.
01Gn 39:21 But the Lord was with Joseph. He extended gracious love to him, granting him favor with the prison warden. 
01Gn 39:22 So the prison warden entrusted into Joseph's care all the prisoners who were confined in prison. Whatever they did, Joseph was in charge of the work detail. 
01Gn 39:23 The prison warden did not have to worry about anything under Joseph's care, because the Lord was with him. That's why Joseph prospered in everything he did.
01Gn 40:1 Some time after these things, both the senior security advisor to the king of Egypt and his head chef offended their master, Egypt's king. 
01Gn 40:2 Pharaoh was so angry with his two officers - his senior security advisor and his head chef - 
01Gn 40:3 tha the locked them up in the prison dungeon operated by the captain of the guard, the very place where Joseph was imprisoned.
01Gn 40:4 The captain of the guard entrusted them to Joseph's custody, who ministered to them, since they were to remain there in custody for a number of days.
01Gn 40:5 Then the two of them each had a dream. They both had their dreams the same night and they both had their own unique interpretations for their dreams - the senior security advisor and the head chef to the king of Egypt, who had confined them in prison.
01Gn 40:6 When Joseph came to see them in the morning, he noticed how downcast they looked! They were both very sad. 
01Gn 40:7 So he asked the officers of Pharaoh, who were with him in prison in his master's house, "Why are you so sad today?"
01Gn 40:8 They responded to him, "We had a dream, but there's no one to interpret it." Then Joseph said to them, "Interpretations belong to God. Please tell me your stories."
01Gn 40:9 So the senior security advisor related his dream to Joseph. "In my dream," he said, "all of a sudden there was a vine in front of me! 
01Gn 40:10 On the vine were three branches. It budded, blossoms shot out, and clusters grew up and produced ripe grapes.
01Gn 40:11 Then, with Pharaoh's cup in my hand, I took the grapes, squeezed them into Pharaoh's cup, then handed the cup directly to Pharaoh."
01Gn 40:12 Then Joseph said to him, "This is its interpretation. The three branches are three days. 
01Gn 40:13 Withinthreedays,Pharaohwillencourageyou and return you to your responsibilities. You'll attend to Pharaoh's personal wine cup, just as you did when you were his senior security advisor. 
01Gn 40:14 But keep me in mind when things go well for you. Be sure to extend kindness to me by remembering me to Pharaoh. Bring me out of this prison,
01Gn 40:15 because I was kidnapped from the land of the Hebrews. Not only that, I haven't done anything that deserves me being confined to this pit."
01Gn 40:16 When the head chef heard that the interpretation was good, he said to Joseph, "I was also in my dream. All of a sudden, there were three baskets with white bread stacked on top of my head. 
01Gn 40:17 On th e basket that was uppermost, there were all kinds of food, including baked food for Pharaoh. The birds were eating them from the basket on my head.
01Gn 40:18 Joseph replied, "This is its interpretation£º The three baskets are also three days. 
01Gn 40:19 Within three more days, Pharaoh will lift your head from you and hang you on gallows, where birds will eat your flesh from you."
01Gn 40:20 On the third day, which just happened to be Pharaoh's birthday, he threw a party for all his servants. He lifted the head of his senior security advisor and of his head chef in front of his servants -  
01Gn 40:21 he restored his senior security advisor to his former responsibilities, including attending to Pharaoh's personal wine cup, 
01Gn 40:22 but he hanged the head chef, just as Joseph had interpreted for them. 
01Gn 40:23 Despite all of this, the senior security advisor not only didn't remember Joseph, he deliberately forgot him.
01Gn 41:1 Two years later - to the day - Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile River, 
01Gn 41:2 when all of a sudden seven healthy, plump cows emerged from the Nile to graze in the grass that grew in the reeds that lined the bank. 
01Gn 41:3 Right after that, seven more cows came up out of the Nile. Ugly and gaunt, they stood next to the other cows on the bank of the Nile River. 
01Gn 41:4 But all of a sudden they ate up the seven healthy, plump cows! Then Pharaoh woke up.3
01Gn 41:5 After he had fallen back to sleep, he had a second dream, in which seven ears of plump, fruit-filled grain grew up on a single stalk. 
01Gn 41:6 Suddenly seven thin ears of grain that had been scorched by an east wind sprouted up right after them 
01Gn 41:7 and ate up the seven plump, fruit-filled ears. Then Pharaoh woke up a second time, and it had been a very vivid dream!
01Gn 41:8 The very next morning, he was frustrated about the dream, so he sent word to summon all the magicians and wise men of Egypt. Pharaoh told them what he had dreamed, but no one could interpret the dreams for Pharaoh.
01Gn 41:9 Then Pharaoh's senior security advisor spoke up. "Maybe I should make a confession. 
01Gn 41:10 When Pharaoh was angry with some of his servants, he incarcerated me in custody of the captain of the bodyguard, along with Pharaoh's senior chef. 
01Gn 41:11 We each had a dream on the same night, and each dream had its own meaning. 
01Gn 41:12 There was a Hebrew young man incarcerated with us, who was also serving as a servant to the captain of the bodyguard. "We each related our dreams, and then he interpreted them for us. He provided specific meanings for each of our dreams. 
01Gn 41:13 And what he interpreted for each of us came true! Pharaoh restored me to my responsibilities, but he executed the other man.
01Gn 41:14 Pharoah sent word to summon Joseph quickly from the dungeon, so they shaved his beard, changed his clothes, and then sent him straight to Pharaoh. 
01Gn 41:15 "I've had a dream," Pharaoh told Joseph, "but nobody can interpret it. I've heard that you can interpret dreams."
01Gn 41:16 "I cannot do that," Joseph replied, "but God is concerned about Pharaoh's well-being."
01Gn 41:17 So Pharaoh told Joseph, "In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile River, 
01Gn 41:18 and all of a sudden seven healthy, plump, beautiful cows emerged from the Nile and began to graze among the reeds that line the bank. 
01Gn 41:19 Just then, seven other cows emerged after them. Poor, ugly, and appearing very gaunt in their flesh, I've never seen anything as ugly as those cows throughout the entire land of Egypt! 
01Gn 41:20 But those thin, gaunt cows gobbled up the first seven healthy cows!
01Gn 41:21 "Not only that," Pharaoh continued, "after they had finished devouring the cows, nobody could tell that they had gobbled them up, because they were just as ugly as before. Then I woke up. 
01Gn 41:22 Later, I also dreamed about seven plump, fruit-filled ears of grain that grew up out of a single stalk. 
01Gn 41:23 All of a sudden, seven thin, withered ears of grain, scorched by the east wind, sprouted up after them. 
01Gn 41:24 But the thin ears gobbled up the seven good ears. I told all this to my advisors, but nobody was able to explain it to me."
01Gn 41:25 "Pharaoh's dreams are identical," Joseph replied. "God has told Pharaoh what he is getting ready to do. 
01Gn 41:26 The seven healthy cows represent seven years, as do the seven healthy ears. The dreams are identical. 
01Gn 41:27 The seven gaunt cows that arose after the healthy cows are seven years, as are the seven gaunt ears scorched by the east wind. There will be seven years of famine. 
01Gn 41:28 So the message that I have for Pharaoh is that God is telling Pharaoh what he is getting ready to do. 
01Gn 41:29 Be advised that seven years of phenomenal abundance are coming throughout all the land of Egypt, 01Gn 41:30 but after them seven years of famine are ahead, during which all of the abundance will be forgotten throughout the land of Egypt. The famine will ravage the land so severely that 
01Gn 41:31 surplus will be unknown in the land due to the coming famine, because it will be very severe.
01Gn 41:32 "Now about the repeating of that dream twice for the benefit of Pharaoh, this event has been scheduled by God, and God will bring it to pass very soon. 
01Gn 41:33 Therefore let the Pharaoh select a wise, discerning person to place in charge over the land of Egypt. 
01Gn 41:34 Also, let the Pharaoh immediately proceed to appoint supervisors over the land of Egypt, who will collect one fifth of its agricultural production during the coming seven years of abundance.
01Gn 41:35 "Let them collect all the food during the coming fruitful years, store up the grain in cities governed by the Pharaoh's authority, and place it under guard. 
01Gn 41:36 Let the food be kept in reserve to feed the land for the seven years of famine that will occur throughout Egypt, so the land won't perish during the famine."35
01Gn 41:37 What Joseph proposed pleased Pharaoh and all of his advisors, 
01Gn 41:38 so Pharaoh asked his servants, "Can we find anyone else like this - someone in whom the Spirit of God lives -  
01Gn 41:39 Since God has revealed all of this to you," Pharaoh said to Joseph, "there is no one so wise and discerning as you. 
01Gn 41:40 So you are to be appointed in charge over my palace, and all of my people are to do whatever you command them to do. Only the throne will have greater authority than you."39
01Gn 41:41 "Look!" Pharaoh confirmed to Joseph, "I've put you in charge of the entire land of Egypt!"
01Gn 41:42 Then Pharaoh removed his signet ring from his hand, placed it on Joseph's hand, had him clothed in fine linen garments, and placed a gold chain around his neck. 
01Gn 41:43 Then he provided him with a chariot for his second-in-command, outfitted with a group of people who shouted out in front of him, "Bow your knees!" And that's how Pharaoh set Joseph over the entire land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:44 Furthermore, Pharaoh said to Joseph, "I'm still Pharaoh, but without your permission nobody in all of the land of Egypt will so much as lift up their hands or take a step!" 
01Gn 41:45 Pharaoh also changed Joseph's name to Zaphenath-paneah and gave Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On, as his wife. And so Joseph gained authority throughout the land of Egypt.
01Gn 41:46 Joseph was 30 years old when he began to serve Pharaoh, king of Egypt, by traveling throughout the land of Egypt, away from the oversight of Pharaoh. 
01Gn 41:47 While the earth was producing bumper crops during the seven abundant years, 
01Gn 41:48 he collected the surplus food during the seven years of plenty throughout the land of Egypt, storing food in cities; that is, he gathered the food from fields that surrounded every city and stored it there. 
01Gn 41:49 Joseph stored up so much grain in so much abundance - like sand on the seashore! - that he stopped keeping records because it was proving to be impossible to measure how much they were gathering.
01Gn 41:50 Before the years of famine arrived, Joseph fathered two sons by Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On. 
01Gn 41:51 Joseph named his firstborn son Manasseh because, he claimed, "God has made me forget all of my hard life and my father's house." 
01Gn 41:52 He named his second son Ephraim because, he claimed, "God has made me fruitful in the land of my troubles."
01Gn 41:53 As soon as the seven years of abundance that pervaded the land of Egypt came to a conclusion, 
01Gn 41:54 the seven years of famine started, just as Joseph had predicted. It was an international famine, but there was food everywhere throughout the land of Egypt. 
01Gn 41:55 Eventually, the land of Egypt began to feel the effects of the famine, so they cried out to Pharaoh for food. "Go see Joseph," Pharaoh announced to all the Egyptians, "and do whatever he tells you to do." 
01Gn 41:56 Because the famine had spread nationwide, Joseph opened all of the storehouses and sold grain to the Egyptians, because the famine was beginning to be severe throughout the land of Egypt. 
01Gn 41:57 In addition, all of the surrounding nations came to Joseph to buy grain from Egypt, because the famine had become severe throughout the world.
01Gn 42:1 Eventually, Jacob observed that there was grain in Egypt, so he asked his sons, "Why do you keep on staring at one another -  
01Gn 42:2 Pay attention now! I've heard that there is grain in Egypt, so go down there and buy some grain for us, so we can live, instead of dying."
01Gn 42:3 So ten of Joseph's brothers left to buy grain from Egypt. 
01Gn 42:4 Jacob would not send Joseph's brother Benjamin to accompany them, because he was saying, "I'm afraid that he'll come to some kind of harm." 
01Gn 42:5 Israel's sons went in a caravan that included others who were going to Egypt to buy grain, because the famine pervaded the land of Canaan, too.
01Gn 42:6 Meanwhile, Joseph continued to be ruler over the land, in charge of selling to everyone in the land. Joseph's brothers appeared and bowed down to him, face down. 
01Gn 42:7 As soon as Joseph saw his brothers, he knew who they were, but he remained disguised and asked them gruffly, "Where are you from?" "From the land of Canaan," they replied. "We're here to buy food."
01Gn 42:8 But Joseph had already recognized his brothers, even though they had not recognized him. 
01Gn 42:9 Furthermore, Joseph remembered the dreams that he had about them. So he accused them, "You're spies! You've come here to reconnoiter our undefended territories!"
01Gn 42:10 "No, your majesty," they replied. "Your servants have come here to buy food. 
01Gn 42:11 We're all sons of a common father. We're honest men, your majesty. We're not spies!"
01Gn 42:12 But Joseph kept on persisting, "It's just as I've said - you've come here to reconnoiter our undefended territories!"
01Gn 42:13 "But your majesty," they pleaded, "your servants include twelve brothers, the sons of a common father back in the land of Canaan. Please! Our youngest brother remains with our father, and the other is no longer alive."
01Gn 42:14 "I'm right!" Joseph insisted. "Just as I said, you're spies! 
01Gn 42:15 So here's how we'll test you. You can bet the life of Pharaoh that you're not leaving here until your youngest brother comes here! 
01Gn 42:16 One of you is to be sent back so he can get your brother while you remain in custody. That way, we'll test whether or not you're telling the truth. If you're not, as surely as the Pharaoh lives, you're spies!"15
01Gn 42:17 Then Joseph locked them all together in prison for three days. 
01Gn 42:18 Three days later, Joseph told them, "I fear God, so do this and you'll live. 
01Gn 42:19 If you're honest men, leave one of your brothers here in custody, then the rest of you can leave and transport some grain to alleviate the famine that's affecting your households. 
01Gn 42:20 Just be sure to bring your youngest brother back to me so what you've claimed can be verified. That way, you won't die."
01Gn 42:21 "We're all guilty because of what we did to our brother!" they said to each other. "We kept on watching his suffering while he pleaded with us! We're in this mess because we wouldn't listen!"
01Gn 42:22 "Didn't I tell you!" Reuben replied. "'Don't wrong the kid!' I said, but would you listen -  No! Now it's payback time!"
01Gn 42:23 Meanwhile, they had no idea that Joseph could understand them, since he was talking to them through an interpreter. 
01Gn 42:24 He turned away from them and began to weep. When he returned, he spoke with them, but then he took Simeon away from them and had him placed under arrest right in front of them.
01Gn 42:25 After this, Joseph gave orders to fill up their sacks with grain, to return each of their own money to their sacks, and to supply them each with provisions for their return journey. All of this was done for them.
01Gn 42:26 Then they each mounted up, their donkeys having been loaded with grain, and left from there. 
01Gn 42:27 Later on, one of them opened up his sack to give his donkey some fodder after they had stopped at the place where they intended to lodge for the night. There, in the mouth of his sack, was all of his money!
01Gn 42:28 He reported to his brothers, "My money has been returned! It's right here in my sack!" Trembling from their mounting consternation, they each asked one another, "What is God doing to us?"
01Gn 42:29 As soon as they had returned to their father Jacob in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them. 
01Gn 42:30 "The man who was in charge of the land spoke harshly to us," they said. "He accused us of being spies! 
01Gn 42:31 But we told him, 'No! We're honest men! We're not spies! 
01Gn 42:32 Our father has twelve sons, but one of us isn't alive anymore, and our youngest brother is with our father today back home in Canaan.'
01Gn 42:33 "But the man who was in charge of the land responded, 'I'm going to test your honesty. Leave one of your brothers with me, take some grain for the famine that's afflicting your households, and leave. 
01Gn 42:34 But bring your youngest brother back to me so I can be sure that you're honest men, and not spies. Then I'll return your brother to you, and you'll be allowed to trade anywhere in the land.'"
01Gn 42:35 Later on, as they went about unloading their sacks, every man's bundle of money was found in each of their sacks. When they and their father saw their bundles of money, they were greatly distressed. 
01Gn 42:36 Their father Jacob told them, "You're causing me to lose my children! Joseph is gone. Now Simeon is gone, and you're planning to take Benjamin, too. Everything's going against me!"
01Gn 42:37 "Feel free to put my own two sons to death," Reuben responded to his father, "if I don't bring him back to you. Trust me, and I'll bring him back to you."
01Gn 42:38 But Jacob replied, "My son isn't going back with you, since his brother is dead and he's the only one left. If something should harm him along the road that you're going to take, then you'll send me and my gray hair to my death in sorrow!"
01Gn 43:1 Meanwhile, the famine remained severe throughout the region. 
01Gn 43:2 As a result, when Jacob's family was beginning to eat the last of the grain that they had brought back from Egypt, their father told his sons, "Go back to Egypt and buy us some food."
01Gn 43:3 "But Judah reminded him, "The man distinctly warned us 'You'll never see my face unless your brother comes with you.' 
01Gn 43:4 So if you send our brother with us, we'll go down and buy some food. 
01Gn 43:5 But if you don't send him, we're not going, because the man told us, 'You'll never see my face unless your brother is with you.'"
01Gn 43:6 Israel replied, "Why did you make all this trouble by telling the man that you have another brother?"
01Gn 43:7 "The man specifically asked about us and our relatives," they responded. "He asked us, 'Is your father still alive?' and 'Do you have another brother?' So we answered his questions. How could we have known that he would tell us to bring our brother back with us?"
01Gn 43:8 "Send the young man with me," Judah said to his father Israel, "and we'll get up and go so we can survive and not die - and that includes all of us, you and our families. 
01Gn 43:9 I'll even offer myself to guarantee that I'll be responsible for him. If I don't bring him back and present him to you, I'll personally bear the consequences forever. 
01Gn 43:10 After all, if we hadn't delayed, we could have been there and back twice by now!"9
01Gn 43:11 "If that's the way it has to be," their father Israel replied, "then do this£º take some of the best produce of the land in your containers and take them to the man as a gift - some resin ointment, some honey, fragrant resins, myrrh, pistachios, and almonds. 
01Gn 43:12 Also take twice as much money with you so you can return the money that had been replaced in the mouth of your sacks. Maybe it was an accounting mistake on his part. 
01Gn 43:13 And be sure to take your brother, too. So get up, return to the man, 
01Gn 43:14 and may God almighty give you compassion in the presence of the man. May he send all of you back, including your other brother and Benjamin. Now as for me, if I lose my children, I lose them."
01Gn 43:15 So the men took their gift and double the money. Then they got up, took Benjamin with them, and set out for Egypt, and eventually appeared before Joseph.
01Gn 43:16 As soon as Joseph noticed that Benjamin had come with them, he ordered his palace manager, "Bring the men into the palace. Slaughter an animal and prepare it, because these men will be dining with me for lunch." 
01Gn 43:17 So the man did what Joseph had ordered, and brought the men to Joseph's palace.
01Gn 43:18 The men were terrified as they were being taken to Joseph's palace. "It's because of that money that was returned to our sacks the first time we were brought to him," they reasoned. "He's seeking an excuse to attack us, enslave us, and confiscate our donkeys!"
01Gn 43:19 So they approached Joseph's palace manager and talked with him at the palace entrance. 
01Gn 43:20 "Your Excellency," they said, "The first time we came here to buy food, 
01Gn 43:21 when we arrived at our overnight lodging place, we opened our sacks and discovered each man's money was still in the mouth of his sack. All of our money was there! We've brought it back with us in full.
01Gn 43:22 We've also brought along some more money to buy supplies, but we don't know who put our money back into our sacks."
01Gn 43:23 "Relax," the manager said. "You can stop being afraid, now. Your God, the God of your father, has placed hidden treasure within those sacks for you. I've been paid in full." Then he brought Simeon out to them, 
01Gn 43:24 ushered the men into Joseph's palace, gave them water to wash their feet and fodder for their donkeys. 
01Gn 43:25 Then off he went to prepare the honorary meal that was to be made ready for Joseph's arrival at noon, since they had been informed that they were going to be eating there.
01Gn 43:26 When Joseph arrived at his palace, they brought to him their gifts that they had carried with them and bowed to the ground in front of him.
01Gn 43:27 Joseph asked them how they had been doing. "Is your father well, the older gentleman about whom you spoke?" he inquired. "Is he still alive?"
01Gn 43:28 "Your servant, our father, is doing well," they replied. "He is still alive." Then they bowed down in humility.
01Gn 43:29 As Joseph looked up and recognized his brother Benjamin, his own mother's son, he asked, "Is this your youngest brother about whom you spoke to me?" And he addressed him directly, "May God be gracious to you, my son." 
01Gn 43:30 At this, Joseph hurried out, deeply moved because of his brother, and looked for a place to weep by himself. He entered his personal quarters, wept there for a while, 
01Gn 43:31 then washed his face and came out. Barely controlling himself, he ordered his staff to serve the meal.
01Gn 43:32 Joseph's staff served him by himself, his brothers separately, and the Egyptian staff members by themselves, because the Egyptians wouldn't take their meal with the Hebrews, since doing so was detestable for the Egyptians.
01Gn 43:33 Meanwhile, the brothers were seated in front of Joseph in birth order, as befitting the firstborn's birthright and as befitting the youngest man's age. The men stared at one another in astonishment. 
01Gn 43:34 Joseph himself brought portions to them from his own table, except that he provided to Benjamin five times as much as he did for each of the others. So they feasted together and drank freely with him.
01Gn 44:1 Later, Joseph commanded his palace manager, "Fill the men's sacks to full capacity with food and replace each man's money at the top of the sack. 
01Gn 44:2 Then place my cup - the silver one - in the top of the sack belonging to the youngest one, along with the money he brought to buy grain." So the manager did precisely what Joseph told him to do.1
01Gn 44:3 Early the next morning, the men were sent on their way, along with their donkeys. 
01Gn 44:4 They had not traveled far from the city when Joseph ordered his palace manager, "Get up, follow those men, and when you've caught up with them, ask them, 'Why did you repay evil for good -  
01Gn 44:5 Don't you have the cup that my master uses to drink from and also uses to practice divination -  You're wrong to have done this.'" 
01Gn 44:6 So he went after them and made that accusation.5
01Gn 44:7 "Your Excellency," they replied, "Why do you speak like this -  Far be it from your servants to act like this. 
01Gn 44:8 Look, we brought back to you from the land of Canaan the money that we found at the top of our sacks. How, then, could we have stolen silver or gold from your master's palace -  
01Gn 44:9 Go ahead and execute whichever one of your servants is discovered to have it, and we'll remain as your master's slaves."
01Gn 44:10 "Agreed," he responded. "Just as you've said, the one who is found to have it in his possession will become my slave, and the rest of you will be innocent."
01Gn 44:11 So they quickly dismounted, unloaded their sacks to the ground, and each man opened his own sack. 
01Gn 44:12 The palace manager searched for the cup, beginning with the oldest and ending with the youngest, and it was discovered in Benjamin's sack. 
01Gn 44:13 At this, they all tore their clothes, reloaded their donkeys, and returned to the city.
01Gn 44:14 Joseph was waiting for them back at his palace when his brothers returned. They fell to the ground in front of him, 
01Gn 44:15 and Joseph asked them, "Why did you do this -  Don't you know that I'm an expert at practicing divination?"
01Gn 44:16 "What can we say, your Excellency," Judah replied. "How can we explain this or justify ourselves -  God has discovered the sin of your servants, and now we've become slaves to you, your Excellency, both we and the one in whose possession the cup has been discovered."
01Gn 44:17 "Far be it from me to do this," Joseph responded. "The man in whose possession the cup was discovered will be my slave, but the rest of you may leave in peace to be with your father."
01Gn 44:18 But Judah approached him and begged him, "Your Excellency, please allow your servant to speak to you privately. Please don't be angry with your servant, since you are equal to Pharaoh. 
01Gn 44:19 Your Excellency asked his servants, 'Do you have a father or brother?' 
01Gn 44:20 and we answered your Excellency, 'We have an aged father and a younger child who was born when he was old. His brother is now dead, so he's the only survivor living from his mother. His father loves him.'
01Gn 44:21 "But then you ordered your servants, 'Bring him here to me so I can see him for myself.'
01Gn 44:22 "So we told your Excellency, 'The young man cannot leave his father, because if he were to do so, his father would die.' 
01Gn 44:23 But then you told your servants, 'Unless your youngest brother comes back with you, you won't see my face again.'
01Gn 44:24 "Later on, after we had gone back to your servant, my father, we told him what your Excellency had said.
01Gn 44:25 "'Go back,' our father ordered, 'and buy us a little food.'
01Gn 44:26 "But we told him, 'We can't go back there. If our youngest brother accompanies us, we'll go back, but we cannot see the man's face again unless our youngest brother accompanies us.'
01Gn 44:27 "Then your servant, our father, said to us, 'You know my wife bore me two sons. 
01Gn 44:28 One of them left me, so I concluded "I'm certain that he has been torn to pieces," and I haven't seen him since then. 
01Gn 44:29 If you take this one from me, too, and then something harmful happens to him, you will be sending me and my gray hair to death in sorrow.'
01Gn 44:30 "So when I go back to your servant, my father, and the young man isn't with us, since he's constantly living life focused on his son, 
01Gn 44:31 when he notices that the young man hasn't come back with us, he'll die, and your servants really will have brought the gray hair of your servant, our father, to death in sorrow. 
01Gn 44:32 Furthermore, your servant pledged his own life as a guarantee of the young man's safety. I told my father, 'If I don't bring him back to you, then let me be responsible to my father forever.'
01Gn 44:33 "Therefore, please allow your servant to remain as a slave to your Excellency, instead of the young man, and let the young man go back home with his brothers. 
01Gn 44:34 After all, how can I go back to my father if the young man doesn't accompany me -  I'm afraid of what might happen to my father."
01Gn 45:1 At this point, Joseph could not control his emotions any longer, so he cried out to everyone who was standing nearby, "Everybody get away from me!" As a result, none of his staff was anywhere near him when he revealed himself to his brothers. 
01Gn 45:2 He cried so loudly that the Egyptians heard him, including Pharaoh's household.1
01Gn 45:3 Joseph blurted out, "I'm Joseph! Is my father really alive?" But his brothers could not answer him, because they had become terrified to be in his presence.
01Gn 45:4 Joseph implored his brothers, "Please come close to me." So they did. "I'm your brother Joseph," he told them, "whom you sold into slavery in Egypt. 
01Gn 45:5 But don't be distressed or angry at yourselves by selling me here, because God sent me ahead of you all in order to deliver us. 
01Gn 45:6 That's because this famine has been going on for two years now in this region, and there are still five years left, during which there won't be any plowing or harvesting.5
01Gn 45:7 "God sent me ahead of you to preserve you on the earth, and to save you all through a magnificent deliverance. 
01Gn 45:8 As a result, it wasn't you who sent me here, but God himself! He established me as a father-figure to Pharaoh himself! I'm in charge of his entire palace and ruler over the entire land of Egypt. 
01Gn 45:9 So hurry up, go back to my father, and tell him that your son Joseph tells him, 'God has made me master of all of Egypt. Come live with me, and don't delay!'
01Gn 45:10 "You are to live in the land of Goshen, near where I am, including you, your children, your grandchildren, your flocks, your herds, and everything that you own. 
01Gn 45:11 I'll provide for you there, since there are still five years of famine left to go, and you, your households, and everything you own would have otherwise become impoverished.
01Gn 45:12 "Look, now! All of you can see me! And my own brother Benjamin can tell that's my own mouth speaking to you! 
01Gn 45:13 So go tell my father about all of my splendor in Egypt. Tell him about everything that you've seen. Be quick about it, and bring my father down here!"
01Gn 45:14 Then he collapsed on Benjamin's neck and wept while Benjamin wept on his neck. 
01Gn 45:15 He kissed all of his brothers and wept on them, too, and then his brothers were able to talk with him.
01Gn 45:16 As soon as the news reached Pharaoh's palace that Joseph's brothers had arrived, Pharaoh and his servants were ecstatic. 17Pharaoh told Joseph, "Be sure to tell your brothers, 'Do this£º load up your livestock, go back to the land of Canaan, 
01Gn 45:18 get your father and your households, and come back to me. I'll give you the best of the land of Egypt and you can live off the abundance of the land.'
01Gn 45:19 "In addition," Pharaoh ordered, "Do this£º take some transport wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones to ride in, along with your wives, and bring your father and come! 
01Gn 45:20 Don't worry about your household goods, because the best of all the land of Egypt is yours."
01Gn 45:21 So Israel's sons did what they were asked to do, and Joseph provided wagons for them, as Pharaoh had commanded. He also gave them provisions for the journey. 
01Gn 45:22 He gave each of them some changes of clothes, but he also gave Benjamin 300 pieces of silver and five changes of clothes. 
01Gn 45:23 He sent his father ten male donkeys loaded with the best of Egyptian goods and ten female donkeys loaded with grain, bread, and provisions for his father during the journey.
01Gn 45:24 Then Joseph sent his brothers away, and they left for home. As they were leaving, Joseph admonished them, "Don't quarrel on the way back!"
01Gn 45:25 So Joseph's brothers left Egypt and returned to the land of Canaan and to their father Jacob, 
01Gn 45:26 where they informed their father, "Joseph is still alive! As a matter of fact, he's ruling the entire land of Egypt." But Jacob didn't believe them, because his heart had grown numb. 
01Gn 45:27 However, as soon as they had told him everything Joseph had said, and after he saw the wagons that Joseph had sent along to carry him, their father Jacob's spirit was encouraged.
01Gn 45:28 "It's enough," Israel replied. "My son Joseph is still alive. I'm going to go see him before I die!"
01Gn 46:1 Later, Israel began his journey, taking along everything that he owned, and arrived at Beersheba, where he offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 
01Gn 46:2 God spoke to Israel through night visions, addressing him, "Jacob! Jacob!" "Here I am!" Jacob replied.
01Gn 46:3 "I'm God, your father's God. Don't be afraid to move down to Egypt, because I'm going to turn you into a mighty nation there. 
01Gn 46:4 I'm going down with you to Egypt, and I'm certainly going to bring you back again. And Joseph will close your eyes."
01Gn 46:5 So Jacob got up and left Beersheba, and Israel's sons carried their father Jacob, their little ones, and their wives in the transport wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry them. 
01Gn 46:6 They took their livestock and their household property that they had acquired in the land of Canaan and traveled to Egypt. Jacob and all of his descendants went with him -  
01Gn 46:7 including his sons, his grandsons, his daughters, and his granddaughters - every one of his descendants accompanied him to Egypt.
01Gn 46:8 Here's a list of the names of Israel's sons, that is, of Jacob and his sons who moved to Egypt£º Reuben, Jacob's firstborn; 
01Gn 46:9 Reuben's sons Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi; 
01Gn 46:10 Simeon's sons Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul, who was the son of a Canaanite woman; 
01Gn 46:11 Levi's sons Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; 
01Gn 46:12 and Judah's sons Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah. (Technically, Er and Onan had died in the land of Canaan.) Perez's sons were Hezron and Hammul. 
01Gn 46:13 Also included were Issachar's sons Tola, Puvvah, Job, and Shimron; 
01Gn 46:14 along with Zebulun's sons Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 
01Gn 46:15 These were all sons from Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-Aram, along with his daughter Dinah. His sons and daughters numbered 33.12
01Gn 46:16 Also included were Gad's sons Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli; 
01Gn 46:17 Asher's sons Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and their sister Serah. Beriah's sons Heber and Malchiel were also included. 
01Gn 46:18 These were all sons from Zilpah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Leah. She bore these sixteen persons to Jacob.
01Gn 46:19 Jacob's wife Rachel's sons were Joseph and Benjamin.
01Gn 46:20 Joseph's son born in the land of Egypt included Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, daughter of Potiphera, the priest of On, bore to him. 
01Gn 46:21 Benjamin's sons included Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 
01Gn 46:22 These were all the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob - fourteen persons in all.
01Gn 46:23 Also included were Dan's son Hushim; 
01Gn 46:24 Naphtali's sons Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 
01Gn 46:25 There were sons of Bilhah, whom Laban had given to his daughter Rachel. She bore these children to Jacob - seven persons in all.
01Gn 46:26 All of these people, who belonged to Jacob's family, traveled to Egypt. All of his direct descendants, not including Jacob's sons' wives, numbered 66 persons in all. 
01Gn 46:27 Joseph had two sons borne to him in Egypt, and all of the people who came to Egypt of Jacob's household numbered 70. 
01Gn 46:28 He sent Judah ahead of them to meet with Joseph, who would be guiding them to Goshen, and so they arrived. 
01Gn 46:29 Joseph prepared his chariot and went to meet his father Israel in Goshen. As soon as Jacob appeared in his presence, he fell on his neck and wept on his neck for a long time. 
01Gn 46:30 "Now let me die," Israel told Joseph, since I've seen your face and confirmed that you're still alive!"
01Gn 46:31 But Joseph addressed his brothers and his father's household and told them, "I'll go up and tell Pharaoh that my brothers and my father's household have arrived from Canaan to be with me. 
01Gn 46:32 I'll mention that the men are shepherds. Because they've been taking care of livestock, they brought along their flocks, their herds, and everything else that they own. 
01Gn 46:33 When Pharaoh calls for you and asks you 'What's your occupation' 
01Gn 46:34 you are to tell him, 'Your servants have been taking care of livestock from our youth right up to this day. This includes we and our ancestors.' That way, you'll be able to live in the Goshen territory, since shepherds are detestable to the Egyptians."
01Gn 47:1 After this, Joseph went to inform Pharaoh. "My father and brothers have come here from Canaan," he said, "and they've come with their flocks, herds, and everything else they have. I settled them in the Goshen territory!"
01Gn 47:2 He brought along five of his brothers to present before Pharaoh.
01Gn 47:3 Pharaoh asked his brothers, "What are your occupations?" "Your servants are shepherds," they replied, "both we and our ancestors. 
01Gn 47:4 We've come to live for a while in this region, since there is no pasture back in Canaan for your servants' flocks. May your servants please live in the Goshen territory?"
01Gn 47:5 Then Pharaoh replied to Joseph, "Now that your father and your brothers have come to you, 
01Gn 47:6 Egypt is at your disposal, so settle your father and brother in the best part of the land! Let them live in the Goshen territory. If you learn that any of them are especially skilled, put them in charge of my livestock."
01Gn 47:7 Later on, Joseph brought his father Jacob, introduced him to Pharaoh, and blessed Pharaoh. 
01Gn 47:8 "How old are you?" he asked Jacob.
01Gn 47:9 "I'm 130 years old," Jacob replied. "My years have turned out to be few and unpleasant, but I haven't yet reached the age my ancestors did during their sojourn on earth." 
01Gn 47:10 Then Jacob blessed Pharaoh and then left the throne room.
01Gn 47:11 Jacob settled his father and brothers, assigned them land to own in the best part of Egypt, in the territory of Rameses, just as Pharaoh had ordered. 
01Gn 47:12 Joseph provided food for his father, his brothers, and all of his father's household, proportionate to the number of young children.
01Gn 47:13 Meanwhile, there continued to be no food throughout the land, because the famine remained very severe. As a result, both Egypt and Canaan languished under the effects of the famine. 
01Gn 47:14 So Joseph kept on gathering all the money that was to be found throughout Egypt and Canaan in exchange for the grain that was being purchased. He stored the money in Pharaoh's palace.
01Gn 47:15 After all the money had been spent throughout Egypt and Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and demanded, "Give us food! Why should we die right in front of you -  Our money is spent!
01Gn 47:16 "You can surrender your livestock," Joseph replied. "I'll feed them in exchange, since your money is gone."
01Gn 47:17 So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and Joseph traded them for food in exchange for horses, various flocks and herds, and donkeys. He fed them with food in exchange for their livestock during that year.
01Gn 47:18 The following year, they came to him and reminded him, "We won't hide from you, your Excellency, that we've spent all of our money, and that our livestock all belong to you. There's nothing left to trade with you, your Excellency, except our bodies and our territories. 
01Gn 47:19 So why should we and our land die right in front of you -  Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will be slaves to Pharaoh. Give us seed, so we can survive and not die, and so the land won't stay desolate."
01Gn 47:20 So Joseph purchased all of the Egyptian territory for Pharaoh. Every Egyptian sold his field, because the famine's effect was so severe. That's how Pharaoh came to own the land. 
01Gn 47:21 Then Joseph transported the people to cities from one end of Egypt to the other. 
01Gn 47:22 However, he did not purchase land belonging to the priests, because the priests held an allotment, previously provided to them by Pharaoh, from which they lived. That's why they did not sell their land.
01Gn 47:23 After this, Joseph addressed the people. "Pay attention," he said, I've bought you and your land for Pharaoh today, in exchange for seed for you. Now go sow the land. 
01Gn 47:24 When harvest season arrives, you are to provide a fifth of the harvest to Pharaoh. The remaining four fifths are to be for your use, for seed, and to feed you, your households, and your little ones."
01Gn 47:25 "You've saved our lives," they replied. "Let us be approved by you, your Excellency, and we'll be Pharaoh's slaves."
01Gn 47:26 So Joseph crafted a statute concerning Egypt that remains valid to this day that Pharaoh should own a fifth of the produce, excluding the land belonging to the priests, which remained outside of Pharaoh's control.
01Gn 47:27 Israel remained in Egypt's Goshen territory, acquired land there, became prosperous, and grew very numerous. 
01Gn 47:28 He lived for seventeen more years in Egypt, until he had lived a total of 147 years. 
01Gn 47:29 As the time approached for Israel to die, he called for his son Joseph and addressed him. "Please," he asked, "if you're happy with me, make a solemn promise that you'll treat me fairly and kindly by not burying me in Egypt. 
01Gn 47:30 Instead, when I've died, as my ancestors have, you are to carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their tomb." "I'll do what you've asked," he replied.
01Gn 47:31 "Promise me," Israel insisted. So Joseph promised. Then Israel collapsed on the bed.
01Gn 48:1 Some time later, somebody informed Joseph, "Your father is ill!" So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him to visit Jacob.
01Gn 48:2 As soon as Jacob was informed, "Look! Your son Joseph has come to visit you," Israel rallied his strength and sat up in bed.
01Gn 48:3 Jacob reminded Joseph, "God Almighty revealed himself to me at Luz in Canaan and blessed me. 
01Gn 48:4 He told me, 'Pay attention! I'm going to make you fruitful and numerous. I'm going to build you into a vast nation of people and then I'll give this land to your descendants who come after you for an eternal possession.'
01Gn 48:5 "You have two sons who were born to you in Egypt before I came to be with you, whom I now take as my own. Ephraim and Manasseh are mine, just as Reuben and Simeon are. 
01Gn 48:6 Your descendants born after you are to be reckoned as yours and are to be referred to among the names of their brothers in their respective inheritances.
01Gn 48:7 "Now as for me, Rachel died after I arrived in Canaan from Paddan, much to my sorrow. While I was on the journey to Ephrath, I buried her there on the way to Ephrath, which is also known as Bethlehem." 
01Gn 48:8 Just then, Israel saw Joseph's sons and asked, "Who are these?"
01Gn 48:9 "These are my sons," Joseph replied to his father. "God gave them to me here in Egypt." "Please bring them close to me," Jacob said, "so I can bless them."
01Gn 48:10 Now Israel's eyesight had become dim from age. Because he couldn't see well, Joseph brought them close to him, and Israel kissed them both and embraced them. 
01Gn 48:11 Then he told Joseph, "I never thought I'd see you again, and now God has allowed me to see your children as well!"4810
01Gn 48:12 Joseph took them off his knees and then bowed low with his face to the ground. 01Gn 48:13Then he brought them both close to his father, placing Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel's left and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel's right. 
01Gn 48:14 But Israel stretched out his right hand, laying it on Ephraim's head (he was the younger son) and laying his left hand on Manasseh's head (even though Manasseh was the first born).
01Gn 48:15 Then Israel blessed Joseph by saying£º "May the God in whose presence my ancestors Abraham and Isaac walked, the God who has continued shepherding me my whole life even until today,
01Gn 48:16 the angel who has been redeeming me from all sorts of evil, bless these young men. May my name continue to live on within them, including the names of my ancestors Abraham and Isaac, and may they grow into a vast multitude in the midst of the earth."
01Gn 48:17 But Joseph observed that his father had laid his right hand on Ephraim's head. That displeased him, so he grabbed his father's hand and started to remove it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head. 
01Gn 48:18 "No, father, this one is the first born. Place your right hand on his head."
01Gn 48:19 But his father refused. "I know," he said. "I know. He's going to produce a large nation, and he's going to be very great. However, his younger brother will become even greater than he, and his descendants will become a multitude of nations."
01Gn 48:20 That very day, he blessed them with this blessing£º "By you Israel will extend this blessing£º 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh!'" By doing this, he placed Ephraim before Manasseh. 
01Gn 48:21 Then Israel told Joseph, "Pay attention! I'm about to die, but God will be with you. He'll bring you back to the land that belongs to your ancestors. 
01Gn 48:22 I'm assigning one portion more than your brothers from the land that I confiscated from the control of the Amorites in battle.
01Gn 49:1 After this, Jacob called his sons together and told them, "Assemble yourselves around me so I can tell you all what is going to happen to you in the last days.
01Gn 49:2 "Gather together and listen, you children of Jacob. Listen to your father Israel."
01Gn 49:3 "Reuben, you're my first born, my strength, and the firstfruit of my vitality. You excel in rank and excel in power.
01Gn 49:4 But you're as undisciplined as a roaring river, so eventually you won't succeed, because you got in your father's bed, defiled it, and then approached my couch."
01Gn 49:5 "Simeon and Levi are brothers; their violent weapon is their swords.
01Gn 49:6 I'll never join their council; I'll never enter their assembly. In their anger they committed murder and lamed cattle just for fun.
01Gn 49:7 Their anger is cursed, because it is so fierce, as is their vehemence, because it is so cruel. I will separate them throughout Jacob's territory and disperse them throughout Israel."
01Gn 49:8 "Your brothers will praise you, Judah. Your hand will be at the throat of your enemies, and your father's children will bow down to you.
01Gn 49:9 Judah is a lion cub. My son, you have gone up from the prey.       Crouching like a lion, he lies down, Like a lioness, who would dare rouse him - 
01Gn 49:10 The scepter will never depart from Judah, nor a ruler's staff from between his feet, until the one comes who owns them, and to him will belong the allegiance of nations.
01Gn 49:11 Binding his donkey to the vine and his mare's foal to its thick tendrils, he will wash his garments in wine and its robe in the juice of grapes.
01Gn 49:12 His eyes are darker than wine and his teeth whiter than milk."
01Gn 49:13 "Zebulun will settle down near the sea shore and become a safe haven for shipping, bordering Sidon."
01Gn 49:14 "Issachar is a strong donkey, resting between sheepfolds.
01Gn 49:15 He observed that his resting place was excellent, and that the land was pleasant, he bent down, picked up his burdens, and became a slave at forced labor."
01Gn 49:16 "Dan will judge his people as one of Israel's tribe.
01Gn 49:17 Dan will be a snake on the path, a viper on the road that snaps at the heels of horses, causing its rider to fall off.
01Gn 49:18 "Lord, I'm waiting for your salvation."
01Gn 49:19 "Bandits will raid Gad, but Gad will raid them back."
01Gn 49:20 "Asher's food will be delicious; he will be a provider of delicacies fit for royalty."
01Gn 49:21 "Naphtali is a free running deer who produces eloquent literature."
01Gn 49:22 "Joseph is descended from a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine planted near water springs. His branches climb over walls.
01Gn 49:23 Even though enemies attacked him, shooting at him and pursuing him viciously,
01Gn 49:24 nevertheless his bow remained steady and his arms kept in shape by the strength of Jacob's Mighty One, in the name of the Shepherd, Israel's Rock,
01Gn 49:25 by your father's God, who will continually help you, by the Almighty, who will keep on blessing you with blessings from heaven above, with blessings from the deepest ocean, with blessing from the breast and womb.
01Gn 49:26 Your father's blessings will prove to be stronger than blessings from the eternal mountains or bounties from the everlasting hills. May they come to rest on Joseph's head, May they be set upon the brow of the one who was separated from his own brothers."
01Gn 49:27 "Benjamin is vicious like a wolf; what he kills in the morning he devours in the evening."
01Gn 49:28 That's how Israel blessed these twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father told them when he pronounced his blessing for them, blessing each one with a blessing suitable for them.
01Gn 49:29 In his last words, Jacob issued this set of instructions to them all£º "I'm about to be taken home to our people. Bury me alongside my ancestors in the cave in the field that used to belong to Ephron the Hittite. 
01Gn 49:30 It's the cave in the field near Mamre at Machpelah in the land of Canaan that Abraham bought to serve as a cemetery. 
01Gn 49:31 It's where Abraham and his wife Sarah were buried, where Isaac and his wife Rebekah were buried, and where I buried Leah. 
01Gn 49:32 Both the field and the cave that's in it were purchased from the Hittites."
01Gn 49:33 After concluding this set of instructions to his sons, he tucked his feet up into bed, quit breathing, and was gathered to his people.
01Gn 50:1 Then Joseph embraced his father, cried over him, and kissed him. 
01Gn 50:2 Then he issued orders to his physician servants to embalm his father. So they embalmed Israel. 
01Gn 50:3 It took 40 days to complete the process, the normal period required for embalming. Meanwhile, the Egyptians mourned for him for 70 days.
01Gn 50:4 At the conclusion of the mourning period, Joseph addressed Pharaoh's household. "If you're satisfied with me, please take this message to Pharaoh for me. Tell him, 
01Gn 50:5 'My father said to me, "Look! I'm about to die. Bury me in my grave that I dug for myself in the land of Canaan." So please let me travel to bury my father. I'll be right back.'"
01Gn 50:6 "Please go," Pharaoh replied. "Bury your father, as he asked you to do."
01Gn 50:7 So Joseph got up and went to bury his father, accompanied by all of Pharaoh's servants, all of the elders of Egypt, 
01Gn 50:8 all of Joseph's household, his brothers, and his father's household. They left behind in the territory of Goshen only their youngest children, their flocks, and their herds. 
01Gn 50:9 Chariots and horsemen also accompanied him, so there was a very large company
01Gn 50:10 When they arrived at Atad's threshing floor, which is located beyond the Jordan River, they held a great and mournful memorial service, during which he spent seven days in mourning for his father.
01Gn 50:11 As soon as the Canaanites who lived in the land observed the mourning going on at Atad's threshing floor, they commented "This is a significant time of mourning for the Egyptians." That's why the place, which is located beyond the Jordan River, became known as Abel-Mitzraim.
01Gn 50:12 And so Israel's sons did what he had instructed them to do£º 
01Gn 50:13 his sons carried him to the territory of Canaan and buried him in the cave in Machpelah field near Mamre that Abraham had purchased as a cemetery from Ephron the Hittite. 
01Gn 50:14 After he had buried his father, Joseph and his brothers returned to Egypt, along with everyone who had gone with him to attend the burial.13
01Gn 50:15 Later, after Joseph's brothers faced the reality of their father's death, they asked themselves, "What happens if Joseph decides to hold a grudge against us -  What if he pays us back in full for all the wrong things we did to him?"
01Gn 50:16 So they sent this message to Joseph£º 
01Gn 50:17 "Before he died, your father left some instructions. He told us, "Tell Joseph, 'Please forgive your brothers' offenses. I beg you, forgive their sins, because they wronged you.'" So please forgive the transgression of the servants of your father's God." Joseph wept when they talk to him. 
01Gn 50:18 So his brothers went to visit, fell prostrate in his presence, and declared, "Look! We're your servants."
01Gn 50:19 "Don't be afraid," Joseph responded. "Am I sitting in God's place -  
01Gn 50:20 As far as you're concerned, you were planning evil against me, but God intended it for good, planning to bring about the present result so that many people would be preserved alive. 
01Gn 50:21 So don't be afraid! I'll take care of you and your little ones." So Joseph kept on comforting then, speaking to the needs of their hearts.
01Gn 50:22 Joseph continued to live in Egypt, along with his father's household, until he was 110 years old. 
01Gn 50:23 Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim's children, as well as the children who had been born to Manasseh's son Machir, whom he adopted as his own.
01Gn 50:24 Later, Joseph told his brothers, "I'm going to die soon, but God will certainly provide for you and bring you up from this land to the land that he promised with an oath to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob." 
01Gn 50:25 So Joseph made all of Israel's other children promise "Because God is certainly going to take care of you, you are to carry my bones up from here."
01Gn 50:26 Some time later, Joseph died at the age of 110 years, and he was embalmed and placed in a coffin in Egypt.

02Ex 1:1 These are the names of the Israelites who entered Egypt with Jacob, each one having come with his family£º 
02Ex 1:2 Reuben, Simeon, Levi, Judah, 
02Ex 1:3 Issacar, Zebulun, Benjamin, 
02Ex 1:4 Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 
02Ex 1:5 All those who descended from Jacob totaled 75 persons. Now Joseph was already in Egypt. 
02Ex 1:6 Then Joseph, all his brothers, and that entire generation died. 
02Ex 1:7 But the Israelites were fruitful and increased abundantly. They multiplied in numbers and became very, very strong. As a result, the land was filled with them.
02Ex 1:8 Eventually a new king who was unacquainted with Joseph came to power in Egypt. 
02Ex 1:9 He said to his people, "Look, the Israelite people are more numerous and more powerful than we are. 
02Ex 1:10 Come on, let's be careful how we treat them, so that when they grow numerous, if a war breaks out they won't join our enemies, fight against us, and leave our land." 
02Ex 1:11 So the Egyptians placed supervisors over them, oppressing them with heavy burdens. The Israelites built the supply cities of Pithom and Rameses for Pharaoh. 
02Ex 1:12 But the more the Egyptians afflicted the Israelites, the more they multiplied and flourished, so that the Egyptians became terrified of the Israelites. 
02Ex 1:13 The Egyptians ruthlessly forced the Israelites to serve them, 
02Ex 1:14 making their lives bitter through hard labor with mortar, bricks, and all kinds of outdoor labor. They ruthlessly imposed all this work on them.
02Ex 1:15 Later, the king of Egypt spoke to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shifrah and the other Puah. 
02Ex 1:16 "When you help the Hebrew women give birth," he said, "watch them as they deliver. If it's a son, kill him; but if it's a daughter, let her live." 
02Ex 1:17 But the midwives feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt told them. Instead, they let the boys live.
02Ex 1:18 When the king of Egypt called for the midwives, he asked them, "Why have you done this and allowed the boys to live?"1
02Ex 1:19 "Hebrew women aren't like Egyptian women," the midwives replied to Pharaoh. They're so healthy that they give birth before the midwives arrive to help them." 
02Ex 1:20 God was pleased with the midwives, and the people multiplied and became very strong. 
02Ex 1:21 Because the midwives feared God, he provided families for them.
02Ex 1:22 Meanwhile, Pharaoh continued commanding all of his people, "You're to throw away every Hebrew son who is born, but you're to allow every Hebrew daughter to live."
02Ex 2:1 A man of the family of Levi married a Levite's daughter. 
02Ex 2:2 Later, the woman became pregnant and gave birth to a son. She saw that he was a beautiful child, and hid him for three months. 
02Ex 2:3 But when she was no longer able to hide him, she took a papyrus container, coated it with asphalt and pitch, placed the child in it, and put it among the reeds along the bank of the Nile. 
02Ex 2:4 His sister positioned herself some distance away in order to find out what would happen to him.
02Ex 2:5 Then Pharaoh's daughte rcame down to the Nile to bathe while her maids walked along the river bank. She saw the container among the reeds and sent a servant girl to get it.
02Ex 2:6 When she opened it and saw the child, the little boy suddenly began crying. Filled with compassion for him, she exclaimed, "This is one of the Hebrew children!"
02Ex 2:7 Then his sister asked Pharaoh's daughter, "Shall I go and call one of the nursing Hebrew women so she can nurse the child for you?"
02Ex 2:8 Pharaoh's daughter said to her, "Go," so the young girl went and called the child's mother. 
02Ex 2:9 Pharaoh's daughter instructed her, "Take this child and nurse him for me, and I'll pay you a salary." So the woman took the child and nursed him. 
02Ex 2:10 After the child had grown older, she brought him to Pharaoh's daughter, and he became her son. She named him Moses, because she said, "I drew him out of the water."
02Ex 2:11 Years later, after Moses had grown up, he went out to his own people, and took notice of their heavy burdens. He saw an Egyptian beating up a Hebrew, one of his own people. 
02Ex 2:12 Looking around and seeing no one else, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 
02Ex 2:13 Going out the next day, Moses noticed two Hebrew men fighting right in front of him. He said to the one who was at fault, "Why did you strike your companion?"
02Ex 2:14 The man replied, "Who appointed you to be an official judge over us -  Are you planning to kill me like you killed the Egyptian?" Then Moses became terrified and said to himself, "Surely this event has become known!"
02Ex 2:15 When Pharaoh heard about this matter, he tried to kill Moses. So Moses fled from Pharaoh, settled in the land of Midian, and sat down by a well. 
02Ex 2:16 Meanwhile, the seven daughters of a certain Midianite priest would come to draw water in order to fill water troughs for their father's sheep. 
02Ex 2:17 Some shepherds came to drive them away, but Moses got up, came to their rescue, and watered their sheep. 
02Ex 2:18 When they returned to their father Reuel, he asked, "Why have you returned so quickly today?"
02Ex 2:19 "An Egyptian rescued us from the shepherds," they replied, "and he even drew water for us and watered the sheep!"2
02Ex 2:20 "Then where is he?" He asked his daughters. "Why did you leave the man behind -  Go invite him to have something to eat."
02Ex 2:21 Moses agreed to stay with the man, and he gave his daughter Zipporah to Moses in marriage. 
02Ex 2:22 Later she gave birth to a son, and Moses named him Gershom, because he used to say, "I became an alien in a foreign land."
02Ex 2:23 The king of Egypt eventually died, and the Israelites groaned because of the bondage. They cried out, and their cry for deliverance from slavery ascended to God. 
02Ex 2:24 God heard their groaning and remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
02Ex 2:25 God watched the Israelites and took notice of them.
02Ex 3:1 Meanwhile, Moses continued tending the sheep that belonged to his father-in-law Jethro, the priest of Midian. He led the sheep to the western desert and came to Horeb, God's mountain, where 
02Ex 3:2 the angel of the Lord appeared to him in flaming fire from the center of a bush. As Moses continued to watch, amazingly the bush kept on burning but was not consumed. 
02Ex 3:3 Then Moses said to himself, "I'll go over and see this remarkable sight. Why isn't the bush burning up?"2
02Ex 3:4 When the Lord saw that he had gone over to look, God called to him from the center of the bush, "Moses! Moses!" He said, "Here I am."
02Ex 3:5 "Do not come any closer," God said. "Remove your sandals from your feet, because the place where you are standing is holy ground." 
02Ex 3:6 Then he said, "I am the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob." At this, Moses hid his face because he was afraid to look at God.
02Ex 3:7 The Lord said, "I have certainly seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and I have heard their cry caused by their slave masters. I really do understand their pain, 
02Ex 3:8 so I have come down to deliver them from their domination by the Egyptians and to bring them out of that land to a good and spacious land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the territory of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
02Ex 3:9 Now, listen carefully! The cry of the Israelites has come to my attention about how severely the Egyptians have been oppressing them. 
02Ex 3:10 So go! I am sending you to Pharaoh. Bring my people the Israelites out of Egypt."
02Ex 3:11 But Moses said to God, "Who am I -  How can I go to Pharaoh and bring the Israelites out of Egypt?"
02Ex 3:12 Then God said, "I certainly will be with you. And this will be the sign for you that it is I who sent you£º When you have brought the people out of Egypt, all of you will serve God on this mountain." 
02Ex 3:13 Moses said to God, "Look, when I go to the Israelites and tell them, 'The God of your ancestors sent me to you,' they'll say to me, 'What is his name?' What should I say to them?" 
02Ex 3:14 God replied to Moses, "I AM WHO I AM," and then said, "Tell the Israelites£º 'I AM sent me to you.'"
02Ex 3:15 God also said to Moses, "Tell the Israelites, 'The Lord, the God of your ancestors, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob sent me to you.' This is my name forever, and this is how I am to be remembered from generation to generation. 
02Ex 3:16 Go and gather the elders of Israel. Tell them, 'The Lord, the God of your ancestors, appeared to me - the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - and he said, "I have paid close attention to you and to what has been done to you in Egypt. 
02Ex 3:17 I have said that I will bring you out of the affliction of Egypt to the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites - to a land flowing with milk and honey."'3
02Ex 3:18 "The elders of Israel will listen to you, and then you and they are to go to the king of Egypt and say to him, 'The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us. Now, let us take a three day journey into the desert to sacrifice to the Lord our God.' 
02Ex 3:19 I know that the king of Egypt won't allow you to go unless compelled to do so by force, 
02Ex 3:20 so I will stretch out my hand and strike Egypt with all my wonders that I will do there. After that he will release you. 
02Ex 3:21 I will grant this people public favor with the Egyptians, and as a result, when you leave you won't go empty-handed. 
02Ex 3:22 Each woman is to ask her neighbor or any foreign woman in her house for articles of gold and for clothing, and use them to clothe your sons and daughters. You will plunder the Egyptians."3
02Ex 4:1 Then Moses answered, "Look, they won't believe me and they won't listen to me. Instead, they'll say, 'The Lord didn't appear to you.'"
02Ex 4:2 "What's that in your hand?" the Lord asked him. Moses answered, "A staff."
02Ex 4:3 Then God said, "Throw it on the ground." He threw it on the ground and it became a snake. Moses ran away from it.
02Ex 4:4 Then God said to Moses, "Reach out and grab its tail." So he reached out, grabbed it, and it became a staff in his hand. 
02Ex 4:5 God said, "I've done this so that they may believe that the Lord, the God of their ancestors - the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob - has appeared to you."
02Ex 4:6 Again the Lord said to him, "Put your hand into your bosom." He put his hand into his bosom and as soon as he brought it out it was leprous, like snow. 
02Ex 4:7 Then God said, "Put your hand back into your bosom." He returned it to his bosom and as soon as he brought it out, it was restored like the rest of his skin.
02Ex 4:8 "Then if they don't believe you and respond to the first sign, they may respond to the second sign. 
02Ex 4:9 But if they don't believe even these two signs, and won't listen to you, then take some water out of the Nile and pour it on the dry ground. The water you took from the Nile will turn into blood on the dry ground."
02Ex 4:10 Then Moses said to the Lord, "Please, Lord, I'm not eloquent. I never was in the past nor am I now since you spoke to your servant. In fact, I talk too slowly and I have a speech impediment."
02Ex 4:11 Then God asked him, "Who gives a person a mouth -  Who makes him unable to speak, or deaf, or able to see, or blind, or lame -  Is it not I, the Lord -  
02Ex 4:12 Now, go! I myself will help you with your speech, and I'll teach you what you are to say." 
02Ex 4:13 Moses said, "Please, Lord, send somebody else."
02Ex 4:14 Then the Lord was angry with Moses and said, "There is your brother Aaron the Levite isn't there -  I know that he certainly is eloquent. Right now he's coming to meet you and he will be pleased to see you. 
02Ex 4:15 You're to speak to him and tell him what to say. I'll help both you and him with your speech, and I'll teach both of you what you are to do. 
02Ex 4:16 He is to speak to the people for you as your spokesman and you are to act in the role of God for him. 
02Ex 4:17 Now pick up that staff with your hand. You'll use it to perform the signs."
02Ex 4:18 Moses left and returned to his father-in-law Jethro. Moses said to him, "Please let me go and return to my own people in Egypt so I can see whether they're still alive." Jethro said to Moses, "Go in peace."
02Ex 4:19 The Lord said to Moses in Midian, "Go back to Egypt, because all the men who wanted to kill you are dead." 
02Ex 4:20 So Moses took his wife and son, put them on the donkey, and headed back to the land of Egypt. Moses took the staff of God in his hand.
02Ex 4:21 Then the Lord said to Moses, "When you set out to return to Egypt, keep in mind all the wonders that I've put in your power, so that you may do them before Pharaoh. But I'll harden his heart so that he won't let the people go. 
02Ex 4:22 You are to say to Pharaoh, 'This is what the Lord says£º "Israel is my firstborn son. 
02Ex 4:23 And I say to you, 'Let my son go so he may serve me.' If you refuse to let him go, then, I will kill your firstborn son."'"4
02Ex 4:24 But later on, at the lodging place along the way, the Lord met Moses and was about to kill him. 
02Ex 4:25 Zipporah took a flint knife, cut off the foreskin of her son, and touched Moses' feet with it, saying while doing so, "¡¦because you are a bridegroom of blood to me." 
02Ex 4:26 Then the Lord withdrew from him, and she said, "¡¦a bridegroom of blood because of circumcision."
02Ex 4:27 The Lord said to Aaron, "Go meet Moses in the desert." So Aaron went, found him at the mountain of God, and kissed him. 
02Ex 4:28 Moses told Aaron all of the Lord's messages that he had sent with Moses, and all of the signs that he commanded him to do. 
02Ex 4:29 Later, Moses and Aaron brought together all the elders of the Israelites. 
02Ex 4:30 Aaron spoke everything that the Lord had spoken to Moses, and Moses performed the miracles before the very eyes of the people. 
02Ex 4:31 The people believed and understood that the Lord had paid attention to the Israelites and had seen their affliction. They bowed their heads and prostrated themselves in worship.
02Ex 5:1 After Moses and Aaron arrived, they said to Pharaoh, "This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'Let my people go so they may make a pilgrimage for me in the desert."
02Ex 5:2 Pharaoh said, "Who is the Lord that I should listen to him and let Israel go -  I don't know about the Lord, nor will I let Israel go!" 
02Ex 5:3 Then they said, "The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please let us go a three-day journey into the desert to offer sacrifices to the Lord our God so he does not strike us with pestilence or sword.
02Ex 5:4 The king of Egypt replied to them, "Moses and Aaron, why are you keeping the people from their labor -  Go back to your work!" 
02Ex 5:5 Then Pharaoh said, "Look, the people in the land are now numerous, and you are stopping them from working."
02Ex 5:6 That day Pharaoh ordered the taskmasters of the people and their officials, 
02Ex 5:7 "You're no longer to give the people straw for making bricks, as in the past. They must gather straw for themselves. 
02Ex 5:8 But you're to impose the previous quota of bricks that they're making. You're not to reduce it! It is because they're lazy that they're crying out, 'Let's go offer sacrifices to our God.' 
02Ex 5:9 So increase the work load on the people, and let them do it so they don't pay attention to deceptive speeches."8
02Ex 5:10 Then the taskmasters of the people and their officials went out and said to the people, "This is Pharaoh's response£º 'I'll no longer give you any straw. 
02Ex 5:11 Go get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work quotas won't be reduced at all.'" 
02Ex 5:12 So the people scattered throughout the entire land of Egypt to collect stubble for straw.
02Ex 5:13 The taskmasters pressured them by saying, "Finish your work - each day's quota - just as when you were given straw."
02Ex 5:14 The Israelite supervisors whom Pharaoh's taskmasters had appointed over them were beaten and told, "Why didn't you, both yesterday and today, fulfill your quota for making bricks as before?"
02Ex 5:15 The Israelite supervisors came and cried out to Pharaoh, "Why are you doing this to us -  
02Ex 5:16 No straw is being given to us, yet they're saying to us, 'Make bricks!' Look, we are being beaten. It's wrong how you are treating your people!"
02Ex 5:17 Then Pharaoh said, "You are lazy, lazy! That's why you're saying, 'Let's go offer sacrifices to the Lord.' 
02Ex 5:18 Now, go! Work! And straw won't be given to you, but you will deliver the same number of bricks!" 
02Ex 5:19 The Israelite supervisors realized they were in trouble when he said, "You won't reduce each day's quota of bricks!"
02Ex 5:20 As they left Pharaoh's presence, they met Moses and Aaron standing there. 
02Ex 5:21 The supervisors said to them, "May the Lord look on you and judge you! You have made us repulsive in the eyes of Pharaoh and in the eyes of his servants. You have put a sword in their hands to kill us."
02Ex 5:22 So Moses returned to the Lord and asked him, "Lord, why have you caused trouble for this people -  Why have you sent me here -  
02Ex 5:23 Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in your name, he has caused trouble for this people, and you have done nothing to deliver your people."
02Ex 6:1 The Lord said to Moses, "Now you will see what I'll do to Pharaoh. Indeed, he'll send them out under compulsion and he'll drive them out of his land violently." 
02Ex 6:2 Later, God told Moses, "I am the Lord. 
02Ex 6:3 I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob as God Almighty, and did I not reveal to them my name 'Lord' -  
02Ex 6:4 I also established my covenant with them to give them the land of Canaan, the land where they lived as resident aliens for a time. 
02Ex 6:5 Also, I've heard the groaning of the Israelites whom the Egyptians have forced to labor for them, and I've remembered my covenant. 
02Ex 6:6 Therefore, say to the Israelites, 'I am the Lord. I'll bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I'll deliver you from their bondage. I'll redeem you with an outstretched arm and with great acts of judgment. 
02Ex 6:7 I'll take you for my own people, and I'll be your God. Then you will know that I am the Lord your God who brings you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 
02Ex 6:8 I'll bring you to the land that I swore to give to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob. I'll give it to you as a possession. I am the Lord.'"
02Ex 6:9 Then Moses reported this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to Moses due to their irritation and impatience because there was no deliverance and because of the cruel bondage.
02Ex 6:10 Then the Lord said to Moses, 
02Ex 6:11 "Go, speak to Pharaoh, king of Egypt, that he should let the Israelites go out of his land."
02Ex 6:12 Then Moses said right in front of the Lord, "Look, the Israelites didn't listen to me, so how will Pharaoh -  I'm not a persuasive speaker" 
02Ex 6:13 Then the Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron, issuing orders to them regarding the Israelites for delivery to Pharaoh, king of Egypt; that is, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.
02Ex 6:14 These are the heads of their ancestors' households£º the sons of Reuben, the firstborn of Israel£º Hanoch and Pallu; Hezron and Carmi. These are the families of Reuben, including 
02Ex 6:15 Simeon's sons Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jakin, Zohar, and Shaul, the Canaanite woman's son. These are the families of Simeon.
02Ex 6:16 These are the names of Levi's sons according to their genealogies£º Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. Levi lived 137 years. 
02Ex 6:17 Gershon's sons were Libni and Shimei, according to their families. 
02Ex 6:18 Kohath's descendants included Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel.1Now Kohath lived for 133 years. 
02Ex 6:19 The sons of Merari£º Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their genealogies.6
02Ex 6:20 Amram married Jocebed, his father's sister, and she bore him Aaron and Moses. Amram lived for 137 years. 
02Ex 6:21 The sons of Izhar£º Korath, Nepheg, and Zichri. 
02Ex 6:22 The sons of Uzziel£º Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri.
02Ex 6:23 Then Aaron married Elisheba daughter of Amminadab, sister of Nahshon. She bore him Nadab, Abihu, Eleazer, and Ithamar. 
02Ex 6:24 The sons of Korah£º Assir, Elqanah, and Abiasaph. These were the families of the Korahites. 
02Ex 6:25 Aaron's son Eleazar married one of Putiel's daughters, and she bore him Phineas. These are the heads of the ancestors of the Levites, according to their families.
02Ex 6:26 This is the same Aaron and Moses to whom the Lord said, "Bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their tribal divisions." 
02Ex 6:27 They were the ones speaking to Pharaoh king of Egypt to bring the Israelites out of Egypt; this is the same Moses and Aaron.
02Ex 6:28 And it happened when the Lord spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt 29that the Lord told Moses, "I am the Lord. Tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything that I'm saying to you."
02Ex 6:30 Moses said in the presence of the Lord, "Look, I'm not a persuasive speaker, so how will Pharaoh listen to me?"
02Ex 7:1 The Lord said to Moses, "Listen! I've put you in the role of God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron will be your prophet. 
02Ex 7:2 You are to speak all that I've commanded you, and then your brother Aaron will speak to Pharaoh, telling him to let the Israelites go out of his land. 
02Ex 7:3 I'll harden Pharaoh's heart and I'll add more and more of my signs and wonders in the land of Egypt. 
02Ex 7:4 When Pharaoh won't listen to you, I'll let loose my power upon Egypt. I'll bring out my tribal divisions - my people the Israelites - from the land of Egypt with great acts of judgment. 
02Ex 7:5 The Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I stretch out my hand over Egypt to bring the Israelites out from among them." 
02Ex 7:6 Moses and Aaron did what the Lord commanded them. 
02Ex 7:7 Moses was 80 years old and Aaron was 83 when they spoke to Pharaoh.
02Ex 7:8 Then the Lord said to Moses and to Aaron, 
02Ex 7:9 "When Pharaoh says to you, 'Perform a miraculous sign,' then you are to say to Aaron, 'Take your staff and throw it in front of Pharaoh.' It will become a serpent." 
02Ex 7:10 Then Moses and Aaron went in to Pharaoh and did what the Lord had commanded them. Aaron threw his staff in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and it became a serpent. 
02Ex 7:11 Then Pharaoh also called for the wise men and sorcerers, and they - along with the Egyptian magicians - did the same thing with their secret arts. 
02Ex 7:12 So each one threw down his staff and it became a serpent, but Aaron's staff swallowed up their staffs. 
02Ex 7:13 Yet Pharaoh's heart was stubborn and he did not listen to them, just as the Lord had said would happen.
02Ex 7:14 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Pharaoh's heart is hard. He has refused to let the people go. 
02Ex 7:15 Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he's going down to the water. Stand on the bank of the Nile and meet him. Be sure to take with you the staff that was turned into a snake. 
02Ex 7:16 Then say to him, 'The Lord, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you. He says, "Let my people go so they may serve me in the desert, but until now you haven't obeyed. 
02Ex 7:17 'This is what the Lord says£º "By this you will know that I am the Lord£º Right now I'm going to strike the water of the Nile with the staff that's in my hand, and it will be turned to blood. 
02Ex 7:18 The fish in the Nile will die and the river will stink. The Egyptians will be unable to drink water from the Nile."'"'"
02Ex 7:19 The Lord also told Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their Nile, over their ponds, and over their reservoirs, and they'll become blood. There will be blood throughout the land of Egypt, even in their wood and stone containers.'"
02Ex 7:20 Moses and Aaron did just what the Lord had commanded. Aaron raised his staff and struck the water in the Nile in front of Pharaoh and his officials, and all the water in the Nile turned to blood. 
02Ex 7:21 The fish in the Nile died and the river stank. The Egyptians were not able to drink water from the Nile, and blood was throughout the land of Egypt. 
02Ex 7:22 But the Egyptian magicians did the same thing with their secret arts. Pharaoh's heart was stubborn, and he did not listen to them, just as the Lord had said. 
02Ex 7:23 Then Pharaoh turned away, went to his palace, and paid no attention to any of this. 
02Ex 7:24 All the Egyptians dug around the Nile for water to drink because they could not drink from the water in the Nile.24
02Ex 8:1 S even days after the Lord had struck the Nile, he said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and tell him, 'This is what the Lord says£º "Let my people go so they may serve me. 
02Ex 8:2 And if you refuse to let them go, then I'm going to strike all your territory with frogs. 
02Ex 8:3 The Nile will swarm with frogs. They'll come up and enter your house, your bedroom, your bed, and your servants' houses. They'll jump on your people, into your ovens, and into your kneading troughs. 
02Ex 8:4 The frogs will be all over you and your servants."'"
02Ex 8:5 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the Nile, and over the ponds, and bring up frogs over the land of Egypt.'" 
02Ex 8:6 So Aaron stretched his hand over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. 
02Ex 8:7 But the magicians did the same thing with their secret arts, and they brought up frogs on the land of Egypt.
02Ex 8:8 Then Pharaoh called to Moses and Aaron and said, "Plead with the Lord so that he may remove the frogs from me and my people. I'll let the people go so they can offer sacrifices to the Lord."
02Ex 8:9 Moses said to Pharaoh, "You decide when I should plead for you, your servants, and your people to remove the frogs from you and your household. They'll remain only in the Nile."
02Ex 8:1 0Pharaoh said, "Tomorrow." Moses said, "It will be just as you say, so that you may know that there is no one like the Lord our God. 
02Ex 8:1 1The frogs will leave you, your house, your officials, and your people. They'll remain only in the Nile."
02Ex 8:1 2Then Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh's presence, and Moses cried out to the Lord about the frogs which he had sent on Pharaoh. 
02Ex 8:1 3The Lord did just as Moses asked, and the frogs died in the houses, in the courtyards, and in the fields. 
02Ex 8:1 4They gathered them up into large piles and the land smelled terrible. 
02Ex 8:1 5But when Pharaoh saw that there was relief, he hardened his heart and did not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.
02Ex 8:1 6Then the Lord said to Moses, "Tell Aaron, 'Stretch out your staff, strike the dust of the ground, and the dust will become gnats throughout the land of Egypt.'" 
02Ex 8:17 They did this. Aaron stretched his hand out with his staff, struck the dust of the land, and gnats came on people and animals - all the dust of the ground became gnats throughout the land of Egypt. 
02Ex 8:18 The magicians tried to do the same thing with their secret arts, but they were unable to bring out the gnats. The gnats were on the people and the animals.
02Ex 8:19 The magicians said to Pharaoh, "It is the finger of God!" But Pharaoh's heart was stubborn and he did not listen to them, just as the Lord had said.
02Ex 8:20 The Lord said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he's going down to the water. You are to say to him, 'This is what the Lord says£º "Let my people go so they can serve me. 
02Ex 8:21 But if you don't let my people go, I'll send swarms of insects upon you, your servants, your people, and your households. The houses of Egypt - and even the ground on which they stand - will be filled with swarms of insects. 
02Ex 8:22 On that day I'll treat the land of Goshen where my people live differently so that swarms of insects won't be there. As a result, you will know that I the Lord am in the midst of the land. 
02Ex 8:23 I'll make a distinction between my people and your people, and this sign will occur tomorrow."'"
02Ex 8:24 The Lord did this, and dense swarms of insects came into the house of Pharaoh and into the houses of his servants. The land was ruined throughout Egypt because of the swarms of insects.
02Ex 8:25 Then Pharaoh summoned Moses and Aaron and said, "Go, offer sacrifices to your God in the land."
02Ex 8:26 Moses said, "It wouldn't be right to sacrifice in this way because if we do, we will sacrifice to the Lord our God what is offensive to the Egyptians. If we offer sacrifices that are offensive to the Egyptians in front of them, they'll stone us, won't they -  
02Ex 8:27 We must go a three-day journey into the desert, and we'll offer sacrifices to the Lord our God just as he has told us."
02Ex 8:28 Then Pharaoh said, "I'll let you go so you can offer sacrifices to the Lord your God in the desert. But you must not go very far away. Pray for me."
02Ex 8:29 Moses said, "Right now I'm going to leave you, and I'll pray to the Lord that the swarms of insects may depart from Pharaoh, from his officials, and from his people tomorrow. But Pharaoh, don't continue lying by not letting the people go to offer sacrifices to the Lord." 
02Ex 8:30 Then Moses left Pharaoh's presence and prayed to the Lord. 
02Ex 8:31 The Lord did what Moses asked, and the swarms of insects departed from Pharaoh, his officials, and his people. Not one remained. 
02Ex 8:32 But this time also Pharaoh hardened his heart, and he did not let the people go.8
02Ex 9:1 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh and say to him, 'This is what the Lord God of the Hebrews says£º "Let my people go so they may serve me. 
02Ex 9:2 But if you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them, 
02Ex 9:3 then the hand of the Lord will come with a very severe plague on your livestock in the fields, on horses, on donkeys, on camels, on cattle, and on sheep. 
02Ex 9:4 The Lord will distinguish between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of the Egyptians, so that nothing that belongs to the Israelites will die."'"
02Ex 9:5 The Lord set the time£º "Tomorrow the Lord will do this thing in the land." 
02Ex 9:6 The Lord did this thing the next day, and all the livestock of the Egyptians died. But not one of the livestock died that belonged to the Israelites. 
02Ex 9:7 Then Pharaoh inquired and discovered that not a single one of the livestock of Israel had died, but Pharaoh's heart was stubborn and he would not let the people go.
02Ex 9:8 Then the Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "Take handfuls of soot from a kiln, and let Moses throw it into the air in front of Pharaoh. 
02Ex 9:9 The soot will become dust over the entire land of Egypt, and it will become boils erupting into sores on people and animals throughout the land of Egypt." 
02Ex 9:10 So they took soot from the kiln and stood before Pharaoh. Then Moses threw it into the air, and it became boils producing running sores on people and animals. 
02Ex 9:11 The magicians were not able to stand before Moses because of the boils, because the boils were on the magicians and on all the Egyptians. 
02Ex 9:12 The Lord made Pharaoh's heart stubborn so that he would not listen to them, just as the Lord had said to Moses.
02Ex 9:13 The Lord said to Moses, "Get up early in the morning, present yourself to Pharaoh, and say to him, 'This is what the Lord God of the Hebrews says£º "Let my people go so they may serve me. 
02Ex 9:14 Indeed, this time I'm sending all my plagues against you, your officials, and your people, so you may know that there is no one like me in all the earth. 
02Ex 9:15 Indeed, by now I could have sent forth my hand and struck you and your people with a plague, and you would have been destroyed from the earth. 
02Ex 9:16 However, I've kept you standing in order to show you my power and to declare my name in all the earth. 
02Ex 9:17 You are still acting arrogantly against my people by not letting them go. 
02Ex 9:18 Look! About this time tomorrow, I'll send a severe hail storm, such as has not happened in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. 
02Ex 9:19 So send for your livestock and everything that belongs to you that's out in the field, because every person and animal found in the field that has not been brought inside to shelters will die when the hail comes down on them."'"
02Ex 9:20 Whoever feared the word of the Lord among Pharaoh's officials made his servants and livestock flee into shelters. 
02Ex 9:21 But whoever did not pay attention to the word of the Lord left his servants and his livestock outside in the fields.
02Ex 9:22 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand toward heaven, and there will be hail in all the land of Egypt, on people, animals, and all the vegetation of the field throughout the land of Egypt. 
02Ex 9:23 When Moses stretched out his staff toward heaven, the Lord sent thunder and hail, and lightning struck the earth. The Lord rained hail on the land of Egypt.
02Ex 9:24 There was very heavy hail, and lightning was continually flashing in the midst of the hail. There had not been anything like it in the land of Egypt since it had become a nation. 
02Ex 9:25 The hail struck everything, including people and animals, outside in the fields throughout the land of Egypt. The hail struck all the vegetation of the fields and shattered all the trees in the orchards. 
02Ex 9:26 Only in the land of Goshen, where the Israelites were, was there no hail.
02Ex 9:27 Pharaoh sent word and called for Moses and Aaron. "I've sinned this time," he said to them. "The Lord is righteous, but I and my people are wicked. 
02Ex 9:28 Pray to the Lord! There has been enough of God's thunder and hail! I'll let you go, and you need not stay any longer." 
02Ex 9:29 Moses said to him, "When I leave the city I'll spread out my hands to the Lord. The thunder will cease and the hail won't continue, so that you may know that the earth belongs to the Lord. 
02Ex 9:30 But as for you and your officials, I know that you don't yet fear the Lord God." 
02Ex 9:31 (Now the flax and the barley were ruined because the barley was in ear and the flax was in bud. 
02Ex 9:32 The wheat and the wild grain were not ruined because they were late crops.)929
02Ex 9:33 Then Moses went out of the city from Pharaoh and spread out his hands to the Lord. The thunder and hail stopped, and the rain no longer poured out on the land. 
02Ex 9:34 When Pharaoh saw that the rain, hail, and thunder had stopped, he continued to sin. He, along with his officials, hardened his heart. 35Pharaoh's heart was stubborn, and he did not let the Israelites go, just as the Lord had said through Moses.933
02Ex 10:1 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go to Pharaoh, for I've hardened his heart and the hearts of his officials in order to perform these signs of mine among them, 
02Ex 10:2 so you may tell your children and your grandchildren how I toyed with the Egyptians and about my miraculous signs that I performed among them, so all of you may know that I am the Lord.
02Ex 10:3 Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, "This is what the Lord God of the Hebrews says£º 'How long will you refuse to humble yourself before me -  Let my people go, so they may serve me. 
02Ex 10:4 But if you refuse to let my people go, tomorrow I'm going to bring locusts into your territory. 
02Ex 10:5 They'll cover the surface of the land so a person cannot see the ground, and they'll eat what is left for you of the residue from the hail. They'll also eat all your trees that grow in the orchards. 
02Ex 10:6 Your houses will be filled along with the houses of all your officials and the houses of all the Egyptians - something that neither your fathers nor your ancestors ever saw from the time they were on earth until now.'" Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh's presence.
02Ex 10:7 Then the officials of Pharaoh said to him, "How long will this man be a snare to us -  Let the people go so they may serve the Lord their God! Don't you realize yet that Egypt is about to be destroyed?"
02Ex 10:8 Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh and he said to them, "Go, serve the Lord your God. But exactly who will go?"
02Ex 10:9 Moses said, "We will go with our young and with our old. We will go with our sons and our daughters, with our sheep and our cattle, because it's a festival to the Lord for us."
02Ex 10:10 Then Pharaoh said to them, "The Lord will certainly be with you if I let you and your little ones go. I know some evil plan is in your mind. 
02Ex 10:11 No! Let the men go and serve the Lord, for that is what you were seeking." Then they were driven out from the presence of Pharaoh.
02Ex 10:12 The Lord said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt to bring the locusts, and they'll come up over the land of Egypt and eat all the vegetation of the land, everything that the hail left." 
02Ex 10:13 Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the Lord sent an east wind into the land all that day and throughout the night. When morning came, the east wind brought the locusts. 
02Ex 10:14 The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled on all the territory of Egypt in great swarms. There had never been locusts like this before nor would there ever be again. 
02Ex 10:15 They covered the surface of the entire land so that it was dark. They ate all the vegetation of the land and the fruit from the trees that the hail left. Nothing green was left on the trees or on the vegetation in all the land of Egypt.
02Ex 10:16 Pharaoh quickly called Moses and Aaron and said, "I've sinned against the Lord your God and against you. 
02Ex 10:17 Now, please forgive my sin only this time, and pray to the Lord your God that he would at least remove this from me."
02Ex 10:18 Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the Lord. 
02Ex 10:19 Then the Lord brought a very strong west wind that took the locusts and drove them into the Reed Sea. Not one locust remained in all the territory of Egypt. 
02Ex 10:20 But the Lord made Pharaoh's heart stubborn and he would not let the Israelites go.1910
02Ex 10:21 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch your hand toward the sky and there will be darkness over the land of Egypt, a darkness that one can feel." 
02Ex 10:22 So Moses stretched his hand toward the sky, and there was thick darkness in all the land of Egypt for three days. 
02Ex 10:23 No one could see anyone else, nor could anyone get up from his place for three days. But there was light for all the Israelites in their dwellings.
02Ex 10:24 Pharaoh called Moses and said, "Go serve the Lord, but your flocks and your cattle are to remain. Even your little ones can go with you!"
02Ex 10:25 Moses said, "You must let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings to offer to the Lord our God. 
02Ex 10:26 And even our livestock must go with us. Not a hoof will be left behind because we will use some of them to serve the Lord our God, and until we get there we won't know what we need to serve the Lord."
02Ex 10:27 The Lord made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he did not want to let them go. 
02Ex 10:28 Then Pharaoh said to him, "Get away from me! Watch out that you never see my face again, because on the day you see my face, you will die!"10
02Ex 10:29 Moses said, "Just as you have said, I won't see your face again!"
02Ex 11:1 Then the Lord told Moses, "I'll bring one more plague on Pharaoh and Egypt. After that he'll let you leave from here, and when he lets you go, he will certainly drive you out from here. 
02Ex 11:2 Tell the people that each man is to ask his neighbor and each woman her neighbor for articles of silver and gold." 
02Ex 11:3 The Lord made the Egyptians look on the people with favor. Also the man Moses was highly regarded in the land of Egypt, both in the sight of Pharaoh's officials and in the sight of the people.
02Ex 11:4 So Moses announced to Pharaoh, "This is what the Lord says£º 'About midnight I'm going throughout Egypt, 
02Ex 11:5 and all the firstborn in the land of Egypt will die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne to the firstborn of the slave girl who operates the hand mill, along with the firstborn of the animals. 
02Ex 11:6 There will be a great cry throughout the land of Egypt, like there has never been and never will be again. 
02Ex 11:7 But among the Israelites, from people to animals, not even a dog will bark, so you may know that the Lord is distinguishing between the Egyptians and the Israelites.' 
02Ex 11:8 All these officials of yours will come down to me, prostrate themselves to me, and say, 'Get out, you and all the people following you!' After that I'll go out." Then Moses angrily left Pharaoh.
02Ex 11:9 The Lord said to Moses, "Pharaoh won't listen to you. As a result, my wonders will increase throughout the land of Egypt. 
02Ex 11:10 Then Moses and Aaron did all these wonders in front of Pharaoh, but the Lord made Pharaoh's heart stubborn, and he would not let the Israelites go out from his land.
02Ex 12:1 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, 
02Ex 12:2 "This month will mark the beginning of months for you. It will be the first month of the year for you. 
02Ex 12:3 Tell the entire congregation of Israel, 'On the tenth of this month they're each to take a lamb for themselves, according to their ancestors' households, one lamb for each household. 
02Ex 12:4 If a household is too small for a lamb, then it and its closest neighbor are to obtain one based on the number of individuals - dividing the lamb based on what each person can eat. 
02Ex 12:5 Your lamb is to be a year old male without blemish. You may take it from the sheep or from the goats. 
02Ex 12:6 It is to remain under your care until the fourteenth day of this month, and then the entire assembly of the congregation of Israel is to slaughter it at twilight. 
02Ex 12:7 They're to take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel of the houses where they eat the lamb. 
02Ex 12:8 That very night they're to eat the meat, roasted over the fire, with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 
02Ex 12:9 Don't eat any of it raw or boiled in water. Instead, roast it over the fire, with its head, legs, and internal organs. 
02Ex 12:10 Don't leave any of it until morning, and whatever does remain of it until morning you are to burn in the fire.5
02Ex 12:11 "'This is how you are to eat it£º with your cloak tucked into your belt, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand. You are to eat it hurriedly - it's the Lord's Passover. 
02Ex 12:12 I'll pass through the land of Egypt that night and strike every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both people and animals. I'll execute judgments on all the gods of Egypt. I am the Lord. 
02Ex 12:13 The blood will be a sign for you on the houses where you are. I'll see the blood and pass over you. There will be no plague to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.
02Ex 12:14 "'This day is to be a memorial for you, and you are to celebrate it as a festival to the Lord. You are to celebrate it as a perpetual ordinance from generation to generation. 
02Ex 12:15 You are to eat unleavened bread for seven days. On the first day be sure to remove all the leaven from your houses, because any person who eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh will be cut off from Israel. 
02Ex 12:16 Also, on the first day you're to hold a holy assembly, and on the seventh day you're to hold a holy assembly. No work is to be done during those days, except for preparing what is to be eaten by each person. 
02Ex 12:17 "'You are to observe the Festival of Unleavened Bread, since on this very day I brought your tribal divisions from the land of Egypt. You are to observe this day from generation to generation as a perpetual ordinance. 
02Ex 12:18 In the first month, from the evening of the fourteenth day of the month until the evening of the twenty-first day of the month, you are to eat unleavened bread. 
02Ex 12:19 For seven days leaven is not to be found in your houses. Indeed, any person who eats anything leavened, is to be cut off from the congregation of Israel, whether an alien or a native of the land. 
02Ex 12:20 You are not to eat what is leavened. You are to eat unleavened bread in all your settlements.'"19
02Ex 12:21 Then Moses summoned all the elders of Israel and said to them, "Choose sheep for your families, and slaughter the Passover lamb. 
02Ex 12:22 Take a bundle of hyssop and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and apply some of the blood in the basin to the lintel and the two doorposts. None of you is to go out of the doorway of his house until morning, 
02Ex 12:23 because the Lord will pass through to strike down the Egyptians, and when he sees the blood on the lintel and the two doorposts, the Lord will pass over the doorway, and won't allow the destroyer to enter your houses to strike you down. 
02Ex 12:24 You are to observe this event as a perpetual ordinance for you and your children forever. 
02Ex 12:25 When you enter the land that the Lord will give you, just as he promised, you are to observe this ritual. 
02Ex 12:26 And when your children say to you, 'What does this ritual mean?' 
02Ex 12:27 you are to say, 'It is the Passover sacrifice to the Lord, who passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when he struck down the Egyptians but spared our houses.'" Then the people bowed down and worshiped. 
02Ex 12:28 The Israelites did this. Moses and Aaron did just what the Lord had commanded.21
02Ex 12:29 And so at midnight the Lord struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the livestock. 
02Ex 12:30 Pharaoh got up during the night, he, all his officials, and all the Egyptians, and there was loud wailing in Egypt, for there was not a house without someone dead in it. 
02Ex 12:31 Then he summoned Moses and Aaron during the night and told them£º "Get up, go out from among my people, both you and the Israelites! Go, serve the Lord as you have said. 
02Ex 12:32 Take both your sheep and your cattle, just as you demanded and go! And bless me too!"31
02Ex 12:33 The Egyptian officials urged the people to send them out of the land quickly, because they were saying, "We'll all be dead!" 
02Ex 12:34 So the people took their dough before it was leavened, with their kneading bowls wrapped up in their cloaks on their shoulders. 
02Ex 12:35 Meanwhile, the Israelites had done as Moses said; they had asked the Egyptians for objects of silver and objects of gold, and for clothes. 
02Ex 12:36 The Lord had given the people favor in the eyes of the Egyptians, so that they gave them what they requested; and so they plundered the Egyptians.34
02Ex 12:37 About 600,000 Israelite men traveled from Rameses to Succoth on foot, not counting children. 
02Ex 12:38 A mixed multitude also went up with them, along with a very large number of livestock, including sheep and cattle. 
02Ex 12:39 They baked the dough that they brought out of Egypt into thin cakes of unleavened bread. It had not been leavened because they were driven out of Egypt and could not wait, nor had they prepared provisions for themselves.
02Ex 12:40 Now the time that the Israelites lived in Egypt was 430 years. 
02Ex 12:41 At the end of 430 years, to the very day, all the tribal divisions of the Lord went out from the land of Egypt. 
02Ex 12:42 That was for the Lord a night of vigil to bring them out of the land of Egypt. This same night belongs to the Lord, and is to be a vigil for all the Israelites from generation to generation.
02Ex 12:43 The Lord said to Moses and Aaron, "These are the regulations for the Passover£º No foreigner is to eat it, 
02Ex 12:44 though any slave purchased with money may eat it after you have circumcised him. 
02Ex 12:45 But no temporary resident or a hired servant is to eat it. 
02Ex 12:46 It is to be eaten in one house, and you are not to take any of the meat outside the house, nor shall you break any of its bones. 
02Ex 12:47 The whole congregation of Israel shall observe it. 
02Ex 12:48 If an alien who resides with you wants to observe the Passover to the Lord, every male in his household must be circumcised, and then he may come near to observe it. He shall be like a native of the land, but no uncircumcised person shall eat it. 
02Ex 12:49 A single law exists for the native and the alien who resides among you."
02Ex 12:50 All the Israelites did this. They did exactly as the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron. 
02Ex 12:51 And on that very day, the Lord brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their tribal divisions.
02Ex 13:1 The Lord spoke to Moses, 
02Ex 13:2 "Consecrate to me every firstborn male. Whatever is the first to open the womb among the Israelites, both of humans and of animals, belongs to me."
02Ex 13:3 Then Moses said to the people, "Remember this day on which you came out of Egypt, from the house of bondage, because the Lord brought you out from this place with a strong show of force. Moreover, nothing leavened shall be eaten. 
02Ex 13:4 Today, in the month of Abib, you are going out. 
02Ex 13:5 When the Lord brings you to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which he swore to your ancestors to give you - a land flowing with milk and honey - you are to observe this ritual in this month. 
02Ex 13:6 You are to eat unleavened bread for seven days, and on the seventh day there shall be a festival to the Lord. 
02Ex 13:7 Unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days, and nothing leavened shall be seen among you, nor is leaven to be seen among you throughout your territory. 
02Ex 13:8 And you are to tell your child on that day, 'This is because of what the Lord did for me when I came out of Egypt.' 
02Ex 13:9 It shall be a sign for you on your hand and a reminder on your forehead, so that you may speak about the instruction of the Lord; for the Lord brought you out of Egypt with a strong show of force. 
02Ex 13:10 You are to keep this ordinance at its appointed time from year to year."8
02Ex 13:11 "When the Lord brings you to the land of the Canaanite and gives it to you, just as he promised you and your ancestors, 
02Ex 13:12 you are to dedicate to the Lord everything that first opens the womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock belong to the Lord. 
02Ex 13:13 You are to redeem every firstborn donkey with a lamb, and if you don't redeem it, you are to break its neck. You are to redeem every firstborn among your sons.
02Ex 13:14 "Then when your child asks you in the future, 'What is this?', you are to say to him, 'The Lord brought us out of Egypt, from the house of bondage with a strong show of force. 
02Ex 13:15 And when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, the Lord killed every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of humans to the firstborn of animals. Therefore, I sacrifice to the Lord every male that first opens the womb, but I redeem every firstborn of my sons.' 
02Ex 13:16 It shall be a sign on your hand and an emblem on your forehead, because the Lord brought us out of Egypt with a strong show of force."
02Ex 13:17 When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them along the road through the land of the Philistines, even though it was nearer, because God had said, "If the people face war, they may change their minds and return to Egypt." 
02Ex 13:18 So God led the people the round about way of the desert toward the Reed Sea. The Israelites went up from the land of Egypt in military formation.
02Ex 13:19 Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, because Joseph had made the Israelites take this solemn oath£º "God will certainly take notice of you, and then you must carry my bones up with you from here."
02Ex 13:20 They left Succoth and camped in Etham at the edge of the desert. 
02Ex 13:02 Exod 13:21The Lord went in front of them by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, so they could travel both day and night. 
02Ex 13:22 Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night left its place in front of the people.
02Ex 14:1 The Lord said to Moses, 
02Ex 14:2 "Tell the Israelites that they are to turn back and camp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You are to camp in front of Baal-zephon, opposite it by the sea. 
02Ex 14:3 Pharaoh will say about the Israelites, 'They're wandering aimlessly in the land, and the desert has closed in on them.' 
02Ex 14:4 I've made Pharaoh's heart stubborn so he will pursue them. And I'll receive honor by means of Pharaoh and his army, so that the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord." So this is what the Israelites did.
02Ex 14:5 W hen the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, the minds of Pharaoh and his officials changed toward the people, and they said, "What have we done in releasing Israel from serving us?" 
02Ex 14:6 S o Pharaoh had his chariot prepared and took his troops with him.
02Ex 14:7 He took 600 of the best chariots, and all the other chariots of Egypt with officers in charge of each one. 
02Ex 14:8 The Lord made the heart of Pharaoh king of Egypt stubborn, and he defiantly pursued the Israelites as they were leaving. 
02Ex 14:9 The Egyptians pursued them - all the chariot-horses of Pharaoh, along with his horsemen and army - and they overtook them camped by the sea, near Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal Zephon.
02Ex 14:10 As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up, and there were the Egyptians bearing down on them! Extremely frightened, the Israelites cried out to the Lord. 
02Ex 14:11 They also said to Moses, "Was it because there were no graves in Egypt that you took us out to die in the desert -  What have you done to us, by bringing us out of Egypt -  
02Ex 14:12 Is this not what we told you in Egypt, when we said, 'Leave us alone!' and 'Let us serve the Egyptians?' Indeed, it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the desert!"
02Ex 14:13 Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid! Stand still and watch how the Lord will deliver you today, because you will never again see the Egyptians whom you're looking at today. 
02Ex 14:14 The Lord will fight for you while you keep still."
02Ex 14:15 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Why are you crying out to me -  Tell the Israelites to move out! 
02Ex 14:16 You are to raise your staff, stretch out your hand over the sea, and divide it, so the Israelites may go into the middle of the sea on dry land. 
02Ex 14:17 Even now I'm hardening the heart of the Egyptians so they'll go after the Israelites. Then I'll receive honor by means of Pharaoh and all his army, his chariots and his horsemen. 
02Ex 14:18 Then the Egyptians will know that I am the Lord when I receive honor by means of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen."17
02Ex 14:19 Then the angel of God, who was going in front of the camp of Israel, moved behind them. The pillar of cloud also moved from in front of them and stood behind them, 
02Ex 14:20 coming between the camp of the Egyptians and the camp of Israel. The cloud remained there even in the darkness, illuminating the night, but the one side did not come near the other all night.19
02Ex 14:21 Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the Lord caused the water to retreat by a strong east wind all night, turning the sea into dry land. As the waters were divided, 
02Ex 14:22 the Israelites went into the middle of the sea on dry land, and the waters formed a wall for them on their right and on their left.
02Ex 14:23 The Egyptians pursued - all the horses of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen - and they went into the middle of the sea after them. 
02Ex 14:24 In the morning watch, the Lord looked down on the Egyptian camp through the pillar of fire and cloud, and he threw the Egyptian camp into confusion. 
02Ex 14:25 He made the wheels of their chariots wobble so that they drove them with difficulty. The Egyptians said, "Let's flee from Israel because the Lord is fighting for them and against us."
02Ex 14:26 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Stretch out your hand over the sea and the waters will come back over the Egyptians, over their chariots, and over their horsemen." 
02Ex 14:27 Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the water returned to its normal depth at daybreak. The Egyptians tried to retreat in front of the advancing water, but the Lord destroyed the Egyptians in the middle of the sea. 
02Ex 14:28 The waters returned, covering the chariots and the horsemen of Pharaoh's entire army that had pursued the Israelites into the sea. Not a single one of them remained. 
02Ex 14:29 But the Israelites walked through the middle of the sea on dry land, and the waters stood like a wall for them on their right and on their left.14
02Ex 14:30 On that day the Lord delivered Israel from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead along the seashore. 
02Ex 14:31 When Israel saw the great force by which the Lord had acted against the Egyptians, the people feared the Lord, and they believed the Lord and Moses his servant.
02Ex 15:1  Then Moses and the Israelites sang this song to the Lord£º "I'll sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted. The horse and its rider he has thrown into the sea.
02Ex 15:2  The Lord is my strength and song, and he has become my salvation. This is my God and I'll praise him, the God of my father and I'll exalt him.
02Ex 15:3  The Lord is a man of war, the Lord is his name!
02Ex 15:4  "Pharaoh's chariots and his army he has hurled into the sea; his best officers sank in the Reed Sea.
02Ex 15:5  The deep covered them, they went down into the depths like a rock.
02Ex 15:6 Your right hand, Lord, was majestic in strength, your right hand, Lord, shattered the enemy.
02Ex 15:7 In the greatness of your majesty you broke down your enemies. You sent forth your anger, it consumed them like stubble.
02Ex 15:8 By the breath of your nostrils the waters were piled up, the flowing waters stood up like a hill, the deep waters congealed in the heart of the sea.
02Ex 15:9 The enemy said, "I'll pursue them, I'll overtake them, I'll divide the spoil. I'll satisfy my anger on them, I'll draw my sword, and my hand will bring them to ruin.
02Ex 15:10 You blew with your breath, and the sea covered them; they sank like lead in the mighty waters.
02Ex 15:11 "Who is like you among the gods, Lord -  Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in splendor, and working wonders - 
02Ex 15:12 You stretched out your right hand, and the earth swallowed them.
02Ex 15:13 "You have led with your gracious love this people whom you redeemed. You have guided them with your strength to your holy dwelling.
02Ex 15:14 The people heard and they quaked, anguish has seized the inhabitants of Philistia.
02Ex 15:15 Then the chiefs of Edom were terrified, the nobles of Moab trembled uncontrollably, and all the inhabitants of Canaan melted away.
02Ex 15:16 Dread and fear have fallen on them, because of the strength of your arm. They have become silent as a stone, until your people pass by, Lord, until this people you acquired pass by.
02Ex 15:17 You will bring them in and plant them on the mountain of your inheritance. You have made a place where you will reside, Lord. Your own hands have established a sanctuary, Lord.
02Ex 15:18 The Lord will reign forever and ever."
02Ex 15:19 When the horses of Pharaoh, his chariots, and his horsemen went into the sea, the Lord caused the waters of the sea to come back over them, but the Israelites walked through the middle of the sea on dry land.
02Ex 15:20 Then Miriam the prophetess, Aaron's sister, took a tambourine in her hand and went out with all the women behind her with tambourines and dancing. 
02Ex 15:21 Miriam sang to them, "Sing to the Lord, for he is highly exalted! The horse and its rider he has thrown into the sea."
02Ex 15:22 Then Moses led Israel from the Reed Sea and they went to the desert of Shur. They traveled into the desert for three days and did not find water. 
02Ex 15:23 When they came to Marah, they could not drink the water at Marah because it was bitter. (That is why it's called Marah.)
02Ex 15:24 Then the people complained against Moses£º "What are we to drink?" 
02Ex 15:25 Moses cried out to the Lord, and the Lord showed him a tree, which he threw into the water, and the water became sweet. There the Lord presented to them a statute and an ordinance, and there he tested them. 
02Ex 15:26 He said, "If you will carefully obey the Lord your God, do what is right in his eyes, listen to his commandments, and keep all his statutes, then I won't inflict on you all the diseases that I inflicted on the Egyptians, because I am the Lord your healer."
02Ex 15:27 Then they came to Elim where there were twelve springs of water and 70 palm trees, and they camped there by the water.15
02Ex 16:1 Later, they left Elim, and the whole congregation of the Israelites came to the desert of Sin, which lay between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt. 
02Ex 16:2 The whole congregation of the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron in the desert. 
02Ex 16:3 The Israelites said to them, "If only we had died by the Lord's hand in the land of Egypt when we sat by the cooking pots, when we ate bread until we were filled - because you brought us to this desert to kill this entire congregation with hunger."
02Ex 16:4 The Lord said to Moses, "Listen very carefully! I'll cause food to rain down for you from heaven, and the people are to go out and gather each day's portion on that day. In this way I'll test them to demonstrate whether or not they'll live according to my instructions. 
02Ex 16:5 On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in, it will be double what they gather on other days."
02Ex 16:6 So Moses and Aaron addressed the entire congregation of the Israelites, "This evening you will know that the Lord has brought you out of the land of Egypt, 
02Ex 16:7 and in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord, for he has heard your complaints against him. After all, who are we that you complain against us?" 
02Ex 16:8 Moses also said, "When the Lord gives you meat to eat in the evening, and bread in the morning to satisfy you, the Lord will hear your complaints directed against him. Who are we -  Your complaints aren't against us, but rather against the Lord."
02Ex 16:9 Then Moses instructed Aaron, "Say to the whole congregation of the Israelites, 'Come near into the Lord's presence, because he has heard your complaints.'"
02Ex 16:10 While Aaron was speaking to all the congregation of the Israelites, they turned toward the desert, and there the glory of the Lord was seen in the cloud. 
02Ex 16:11 The Lord said to Moses, 
02Ex 16:12 "I've heard the complaints of the Israelites. Tell them, 'At twilight you are to eat meat and in the morning you are to be filled with bread, so you may know that I am the Lord your God.'"
02Ex 16:13 Later that evening quail came up and covered the camp, and then in the morning there was a layer of dew around the camp. 
02Ex 16:14 When the layer of dew evaporated, on the surface of the desert a fine flaky substance, as fine as frost, appeared on the ground. 
02Ex 16:15 When the Israelites saw it, they asked one another, "What is it?", because they did not know what it was. Moses told them, "It's the food that the Lord has given you to eat. 
02Ex 16:16 "This is what the Lord has commanded£º 'You are to gather from it what each person is to eat, about two quarts per person according to the number of your people, and one person is to gather for everyone in his tent.'"
02Ex 16:17 The Israelites did this, some gathering much, some little. 
02Ex 16:18 When they measured it with two quart vessels, the one who gathered much did not have an excess, while the one who gathered little did not lack. They gathered exactly what each needed to eat.
02Ex 16:19 Then Moses said to them, "No one is to leave any of it until morning." 
02Ex 16:20 But they did not listen to Moses - some people left part of it until morning, and it produced maggots and smelled bad, so Moses got angry at them. 
02Ex 16:21 Every morning they gathered it, according to what each needed to eat; and when the sun became hot, it melted.20
02Ex 16:22 On the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, about four quarts per person. Then all the leaders of the congregation came and reported to Moses, 
02Ex 16:23 and he told them, "This is what the Lord said£º 'Tomorrow is a Sabbath observance, a holy Sabbath to the Lord. Bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil, and put aside whatever remains to be kept for yourselves until morning.'"
02Ex 16:24 They put it away until morning, as Moses commanded, and it did not smell bad, and there were no maggots in it. 
02Ex 16:25 Moses said, "Eat it today, since today is a Sabbath to the Lord, and today you won't find it in the field. 
02Ex 16:26 For six days you are to gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there won't be any."25
02Ex 16:27 Nevertheless, that seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they did not find any. 
02Ex 16:28 Then the Lord said to Moses, "How long will you people refuse to keep my commandments and my instructions -  
02Ex 16:29 You see that the Lord has given you the Sabbath, and so on the sixth day he gives you food for two days. Let each person stay where he is; let no one leave his place on the seventh day." 
02Ex 16:30 So the people rested on the seventh day.16
02Ex 16:31 The Israelites named it "manna." It was white like coriander seed, and tasted like a wafer made with honey. 
02Ex 16:32 Moses said, "This is what the Lord has commanded£º 'Set aside about two quarts of it for future generations, so that they may see the food with which I fed you in the desert when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"
02Ex 16:33 Then Moses said to Aaron, "Take a jar, fill it with about two quarts of manna, and place it in the Lord's presence, to be preserved throughout future generations." 
02Ex 16:34 So Aaron placed it before the Testimony to be kept, just as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
02Ex 16:35 The Israelites ate manna for 40 years until they came to a land where they could settle. They ate manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan. 
02Ex 16:36 Now two quarts is a tenth of an ephah.
02Ex 17:1 The whole congregation of the Israelites set out from the desert of Sin, traveling from place to place according to the command of the Lord. They camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink.
02Ex 17:2 The people quarreled with Moses£º "Give us water to drink." M oses said to them, "Why are you quarreling with me -  Why are you testing the Lord?"
02Ex 17:3 But the people were thirsty there for water and they complained against Moses£º "Why did you bring us up from Egypt to kill us, our children, and our livestock with thirst?"
02Ex 17:4 So Moses cried out to the Lord£º "What shall I do with these people -  Just a little more and they'll stone me."
02Ex 17:5 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go over in front of the people and take some of the elders of Israel with you. Take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. 
02Ex 17:6 I'll be standing there in front of you on the rock at Horeb. You are to strike the rock and water will come out of it, so the people can drink." Moses did this in front of the elders of Israel.
02Ex 17:7 He named the place Massah and Meribah, because the Israelites quarreled and tested the Lord by saying£º "Is the Lord really among us or not?"
02Ex 17:8 Then the Amalekites came and fought with the Israelites at Rephidim. 
02Ex 17:9 Moses said to Joshua, "Choose some men for us and go out to fight against the Amalekites. Tomorrow I'll stand on top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand." 
02Ex 17:10 So Joshua did as Moses told him and fought against the Amalekites, while Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the top of the hill. 
02Ex 17:11 Whenever Moses raised his hand, the Israelites prevailed, but when his hand remained at his side, then the Amalekites prevailed. 
02Ex 17:12 When Moses' hands became heavy, they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. Aaron and Hur supported his hands, one on one side and one on the other, and so his hands were steady until the sun went down. 
02Ex 17:13 Joshua defeated Amalek and his army with the sword.12
02Ex 17:14 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Write this in a book as a memorial and recite it to Joshua£º 'I'll certainly wipe out the memory of the Amalekites from under heaven.'" 
02Ex 17:15 Moses built an altar and named it "The Lord Is My Banner." 
02Ex 17:16 He said, "Because a fist has been raised in defiance against the throne of the Lord, the Lord will wage war against Amalek from generation to generation."
02Ex 18:1 Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard all that God had done for Moses and for his people Israel, and how the Lord had brought Israel out of Egypt. 
02Ex 18:2 Now Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, had taken back Moses' wife Zipporah after she had been sent away, 
02Ex 18:3 along with her two sons. The name of the one was Gershom, for he said, "I was an alien in a foreign land," 
02Ex 18:4 while the name of the other was Eliezer, for he said, "My father's God helped me and delivered me from Pharaoh's sword."1
02Ex 18:5 Moses' father-in-law Jethro, together with Moses' two sons and his wife, came to Moses in the desert where he was camped at the mountain of God. 
02Ex 18:6 He said to Moses, "I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you along with your wife and her two sons." 
02Ex 18:7 When Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, he bowed low and kissed him, and they greeted one another. Then they went into the tent.
02Ex 18:8 Moses told his father-in-law all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh and to the Egyptians on Israel's behalf, all the hardships that they had encountered along the way, and how the Lord had delivered them. 
02Ex 18:9 Jethro rejoiced over all the good that the Lord had done for Israel in delivering them from the hand of the Egyptians. 
02Ex 18:10 Jethro said, "Blessed be the Lord who delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh, and who delivered the people from the oppression of the Egyptians. 
02Ex 18:11 Now I know that the Lord is greater than all other gods, because of what happened to the Egyptians when they acted arrogantly against Israel." 
02Ex 18:12 Jethro, Moses' father-in-law, brought a burnt offering and sacrifices for God, and Aaron and all the elders of Israel came to dine with Moses' father-in-law in the presence of God.
02Ex 18:13 The next day Moses sat down to judge the people, and the people stood around Moses from morning until evening. 
02Ex 18:14 When Moses' father-in-law saw all that he was doing for the people, he said, "What is this that you are doing for the people -  Why do you alone sit as judge, with all the people standing around you from morning until evening?"
02Ex 18:15 Moses said to his father-in-law, "Because the people come to me to seek God's will. 
02Ex 18:16 When they have a dispute, it comes to me and I decide between a person and his neighbor, and make known the statutes of God and his instructions."
02Ex 18:17 Moses' father-in-law said to him, "What you are doing is not good. 
02Ex 18:18 You will surely wear yourself out, both you and these people who are with you, because the task is too heavy for you. You cannot do it by yourself. 
02Ex 18:19 Now listen to me. I'll advise you, and may God be with you. You are to represent the people before God and shall bring the disputes to God. 
02Ex 18:20 You are to teach them the statutes and instructions and make known to them the way they're to go and the things they're to do.
02Ex 18:21 "You are to look for capable men among the people, men who fear God, men of integrity who hate dishonest gain. You are to set these men over them as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 
02Ex 18:22 They shall judge the people at all times. Let them bring every major matter to you, but let them judge every minor matter. It will lighten your burden, and they'll bear it with you. 
02Ex 18:23 If you do this, and God so commands you, you will be able to stand the strain, and all these people will also go to their homes in peace."
02Ex 18:24 Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything he said. 
02Ex 18:25 Moses chose capable men from all Israel and appointed them as heads over the people, as officials over thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens. 
02Ex 18:26 They judged the people at all times; the difficult matters they brought to Moses, but every minor matter they judged. 
02Ex 18:27 Moses sent his father-in-law on his way, and he went to his own land.1826
02Ex 19:1 On the third new moon after the Israelites went out of the land of Egypt, on that very day, they came to the desert of Sinai. 
02Ex 19:2 They had set out from Rephidim and arrived at the desert of Sinai where they camped in the desert. Israel camped there in front of the mountain. 
02Ex 19:3 Then Moses went up to God, and the Lord called to him from the mountain£º "This is what you are to say to the house of Jacob and declare to the sons of Israel, 
02Ex 19:4 'You saw what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on eagles' wings and brought you to myself. 
02Ex 19:5 And now if you carefully obey me and keep my covenant, you are to be my special possession out of all the peoples. For the whole earth belongs to me, 
02Ex 19:6 but you are to be a kingdom of priests and a holy nation to me.' These are the words you are to declare to the Israelites."
02Ex 19:7 When Moses came, he summoned the elders of the people and told them everything that the Lord had commanded him. 
02Ex 19:8 All the people answered together£º "All that the Lord has said, we will do!" Then Moses reported all the words of the people back to the Lord. 
02Ex 19:9 The Lord said to Moses, "Look, I'm coming to you in a thick cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and believe you always." Moses reported the words of the people to the Lord.
02Ex 19:10 The Lord said to Moses, "Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow. They must wash their clothes, 
02Ex 19:11 and be ready for the third day, for on the third day the Lord will come down on Mount Sinai in the sight of all the people. 
02Ex 19:12 You are to set boundaries for the people all around£º 'Be very careful that you don't go up on the mountain or touch the side of it. Anyone who touches the mountain will surely be put to death. 
02Ex 19:13 No hand shall touch that person, but he shall surely be stoned or shot with arrows; whether animal or person, he shall not live.' They shall approach the mountain only when the ram's horn sounds a long blast."19
02Ex 19:14 When Moses went down from the mountain to the people, he consecrated the people, and they washed their clothes. 
02Ex 19:15 He said to the people, "Be ready for the third day; don't go near a woman."
02Ex 19:16 When morning came on the third day, there was thunder and lightning with a heavy cloud over the mountain and the very loud sound of a ram's horn. All the people in the camp trembled. 
02Ex 19:17 Moses brought the people from the camp to meet God, and they stood at the base of the mountain. 
02Ex 19:18 Mount Sinai was completely enveloped in smoke because the Lord had come down in fire on it. Smoke went up from it like smoke from a kiln, and the whole mountain shook violently. 
02Ex 19:19 As the sound of the ram's horn grew louder and louder, Moses would speak and God would answer with thunder. 
02Ex 19:20 When the Lord came down on Mount Sinai to the top of the mountain, he summoned Moses to the top of the mountain, and Moses went up.
02Ex 19:21 The Lord said to Moses, "Go down and warn the people so they don't break through to look at the Lord, and many of them perish. 
02Ex 19:22 Even the priests who approach the Lord must consecrate themselves. Otherwise, the Lord will attack them."
02Ex 19:23 Moses said to the Lord, "The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai because you warned us£º 'Set boundaries around the mountain and consecrate it.'"
02Ex 19:24 The Lord said to him, "Go down, and come back up with Aaron, but the priests and the people must not break through to go up to the Lord. Otherwise, he will attack them. 
02Ex 19:25 So Moses went down to the people and spoke to them.
02Ex 20:1 Then God spoke all these words:
02Ex 20:2 "I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 3"You are to have no other gods besides me.
02Ex 20:4 "You are not to make for yourselves an idol, or any likeness of what is in heaven above, or on earth below, or in the water under the earth. 
02Ex 20:5 You are not to bow down to them in worship or serve them; because I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the iniquity of the parents, to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me, 
02Ex 20:6 but showing gracious love to thousands who love me and keep my commandments.
02Ex 20:7 "You are not to misuse the name of the Lord your God, because the Lord will not leave the one who misuses his name unpunished.
02Ex 20:8 "Remember to keep the Sabbath day holy. 
02Ex 20:9 Six days you are to labor and do all your work, 
02Ex 20:10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. You are not to do any work, neither you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male or female servant, nor your livestock, nor the alien who is within your gates, 
02Ex 20:11 because the Lord   made the heavens and the earth and the sea, and all that is in them, in six days, then he rested on the seventh day. Therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
02Ex 20:12 "Honor your father and your mother so that you may live long in the land which the Lord your God is giving you.
02Ex 20:13 "You are not to murder.
02Ex 20:14 "You are not to commit adultery.
02Ex 20:15 "You are not to steal.
02Ex 20:16 "You are not to testify falsely against your neighbor.
02Ex 20:17 "You are not to covet your neighbor's house. You are not to covet your neighbor's wife, or his male or female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor."
02Ex 20:18 All the people experienced the thunder and lightning, the sound of the ram's horn, and the smoking mountain. And as the people experienced it, they trembled and stood at a distance. 
02Ex 20:19 They said to Moses, "You speak to us and we will listen, but don't let God speak with us, or we may die.
02Ex 20:20 Moses said to the people, "Don't be afraid, for God has come to test you, so that you may fear him in order that you don't sin." 
02Ex 20:21 Then the people stood at a distance, and Moses approached the thick cloud where God was.2020
02Ex 20:22 The Lord said to Moses, "This is what you are to say to the Israelites, 'You have seen for yourselves that I spoke to you from heaven. 
02Ex 20:23 You are not to make gods of silver alongside me, nor shall you make for yourselves gods of gold.
02Ex 20:24 'You are to make an altar of earth for me, and you are to sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and peace offerings, your sheep, and your cattle. Everywhere I cause my name to be remembered, I'll come to you and bless you. 
02Ex 20:25 If you make an altar of stone for me, you must not build it of cut stones, because if you strike it with your chisel, you will profane it. 
02Ex 20:26 You are not to ascend to my altar on steps, so that your nakedness may not be exposed on it.'
02Ex 21:1 "These are the ordinances that you are to set before them.
02Ex 21:2 "When you acquire a Hebrew servant he shall serve for six years, and in the seventh he shall go out a free man without paying anything. 
02Ex 21:3 If he came in by himself, he shall go out by himself. If he was married, his wife shall go out with him. 
02Ex 21:4 If his master gives him a wife and she bears him sons or daughters, the wife and children belong to her master, and he shall go out by himself.
02Ex 21:5 "But if the servant, in fact, says, 'I love my master, my wife, and my children and I won't go out a free man,' 
02Ex 21:6 then his master shall bring him before the judges and he shall bring him to the door or the doorpost. His master shall pierce his ear with an awl, and he shall serve him permanently.
02Ex 21:7 "When a man sells his daughter as a servant, she won't go out as the male servants do.

02Ex 24:1 The Lord said to Moses, "Come up to the Lord, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel, and worship at a distance. 
02Ex 24:2 Only Moses shall approach the Lord, but the others shall not approach; the people shall not come up with him."
02Ex 24:3 Then Moses came and reported all the words of the Lord and all the statutes to the people, and they all answered with one voice, "All the things that the Lord has spoken, we will do." 
02Ex 24:4 So Moses wrote down all the words of the Lord. He got up early in the morning and built an altar with twelve pillars for the twelve tribes of Israel at the bottom of the mountain. 
02Ex 24:5 He sent young Israelite men to offer up burnt offerings and sacrifice bulls as peace offerings to the Lord. 
02Ex 24:6 Moses took half the blood and put it in bowls, while he sprinkled the other half on the altar. 
02Ex 24:7 He took the Book of the Covenant and read it to the people. They said, "All that the Lord has spoken we will do and obey."
02Ex 24:8 Moses took the blood, sprinkled it on the people, and said, "This is the blood of the covenant which the Lord made with you based on all these words."
02Ex 24:9 Then Moses and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu and seventy of the elders of Israel went up 
02Ex 24:10 and saw the God of Israel. Under his feet was something like a pavement made of sapphire, and as clear as the sky. 
02Ex 24:11 Because God did not punish the Israelite leaders, they looked at God, yet lived to eat and drink.
02Ex 24:12 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Go up to me on the mountain and stay there. I'll give you stone tablets with the instruction and law that I've written to teach the people."24
02Ex 24:13 Moses got up with Joshua his servant, and went up on the mountain of God. 
02Ex 24:14 He said to the elders, "Wait here for us until we return to you. Look, Aaron and Hur are with you, and whoever has a dispute, let him come to them." 
02Ex 24:15 When Moses went up on the mountain, the cloud covered it. 
02Ex 24:16 The glory of the Lord settled on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. Then on the seventh day he called to Moses from within the cloud. 
02Ex 24:17 To the Israelites the appearance of the glory of the Lord was like a consuming fire on top of the mountain. 
02Ex 24:18 When Moses went up on the mountain, he went into the center of the cloud and was on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights.1624
02Ex 25:1 The Lord said to Moses,
02Ex 25:2 "Tell the Israelites to take an offering for me, and you are to accept my offering from every person whose heart moves him to give.

02Ex 30:11 The Lord said to Moses, 
02Ex 30:12 "When you take a census of the Israelites to register them, each shall give a ransom for himself to the Lord when they're registered so there won't be a plague among them when they're registered. 
02Ex 30:13 This is what everyone who is registered shall give£º half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary (the shekel is twenty gerahs), half a shekel as a contribution to the Lord.

02Ex 30:17 The Lord said to Moses, 
02Ex 30:18 "You are to make a bronze basin with a bronze base for washing. You are to put it between the Tent of Meeting and the altar and put water in it, 
02Ex 30:19 and Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet from it. 
02Ex 30:20 When they enter the Tent of Meeting or when they approach the altar to minister to make an offering by fire to the Lord, they are to wash with water so they don't die. 
02Ex 30:21 They shall wash their hands and their feet so that they don't die, and it shall be for them a perpetual ordinance for Aaron and his seed from generation to generation."
02Ex 30:22 The Lord said to Moses, 
02Ex 30:23 "You are to take for yourself the finest spices£º 500 shekels of liquid myrrh, half as much fragrant cinnamon (250 shekels), 250 shekels of fragrant reeds, 
02Ex 30:24 500 shekels of cassia - all according to the shekel of the sanctuary - and a gallon of olive oil. 
02Ex 30:25 You are to make them into a holy anointing oil, a perfume mixture made by a perfumer. It shall be a holy anointing oil.
02Ex 30:26 "With it you are to anoint the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of Testimony, 
02Ex 30:27 the table and all its utensils, the lamp stand and its utensils, the altar of incense, 
02Ex 30:28 the altar for burnt offerings and all its utensils, and the basin and its base. 
02Ex 30:29 You are to consecrate them and they are to be most holy. Whatever touches them shall be holy. 
02Ex 30:30 You are to anoint Aaron and his sons, and you are to consecrate them to serve as my priests. 
02Ex 30:31 You are to speak to the Israelites saying, 'This shall be holy anointing oil for me from generation to generation. 
02Ex 30:32 It is not to be poured out on a person's body, nor shall you make anything like it with similar formulations. It is holy, and it shall be holy to you. 
02Ex 30:33 Anyone who mixes anything like it or who puts any of it on an unqualified person shall be cut off from his people.'"
02Ex 30:34 The Lord said to Moses, "Take for yourself spices£º stacte, onycha, galbanum, and spices with pure frankincense, all in equal amounts. 3
02Ex 30:35 You are to make it into a fragrant incense, expertly blended, pure, and holy. 
02Ex 30:36 You are to grind some of it fine, and put some before the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting where I shall meet with you. It shall be most holy to you. 
02Ex 30:37 You are not to make the incense that you make in this formulation for your own use. It shall be holy to the Lord for you. 
02Ex 30:38 Anyone who makes anything like it to use it as perfume shall be cut off from his people."
02Ex 31:1 The Lord spoke to Moses£º 
02Ex 31:2 "Look, I've called Uri's son Bezalel, grandson of Hur from Judah's tribe 
02Ex 31:3 and I've filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and all kinds of craftsmanship 
02Ex 31:4 to create plans for work in gold, silver, and bronze, 
02Ex 31:5 and for cutting stones to set them, for carving wood, and for doing all kinds of craftsmanship.
02Ex 31:6 "I'm now appointing with him Ahisamach's son Oholiab from the tribe of Dan, and I've given wisdom to all who are skilled so they can make everything that I've commanded you, 
02Ex 31:7 including the Tent of Meeting, the Ark of Testimony, the Mercy Seat that is on it, all the furnishings of the tent -  
02Ex 31:8 the table and its furnishings, the lamp stand of pure gold, all its furnishings, the altar of incense, 
02Ex 31:9 the altar for burnt offerings, its furnishings, the basin, its base, 
02Ex 31:10 the woven garments, the holy garments of Aaron the priest, the garments of his sons as they serve as priests, 
02Ex 31:11 the anointing oil, and the fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them in accordance with everything that I commanded you."31
02Ex 31:12 The Lord said to Moses, 
02Ex 31:13 "You are to speak to the Israelites£º 'You are to surely observe my Sabbaths because it's a sign between me and you from generation to generation, so you may know that I am the Lord who sanctifies you. 
02Ex 31:14 You are to observe the Sabbath, because it's holy for you. Whoever profanes it shall surely die; indeed, whoever does work on it shall be cut off from among his people. 
02Ex 31:15 Work may be done for six days, but the seventh day is a Sabbath of complete rest, holy to the Lord. Whoever does work on the Sabbath shall surely die. 
02Ex 31:16 The Israelites shall keep the Sabbath to make the Sabbath observance a perpetual covenant from generation to generation. 
02Ex 31:17 It is a sign forever between me and the Israelites, for in six days the Lord made the heavens and the earth, but on the seventh day he rested and was refreshed.'"3113
02Ex 31:18 When he finished speaking with Moses on Mount Sinai, he gave him the two tablets of Testimony, tablets of stone written by the finger of God.
02Ex 32:1 When the people saw that Moses took a long time to come down the mountain, they gathered around Aaron and told him, "Come here and make us a god who will go before us, because, as for this fellow Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him."
02Ex 32:2 Aaron said to them, "Tear off the gold rings which are in the ears of your wives, your sons, and your daughters and bring them to me."
02Ex 32:3 All the people tore off the gold rings which were in their ears and brought them to him. 
02Ex 32:4 He took them from them and, using a tool, fashioned them into a molten calf. The people said, "This, Israel, is your god who brought you out of the land of Egypt."
02Ex 32:5 When Aaron saw this, he built an altar in front of it, and then he proclaimed, "Tomorrow shall be a festival to the Lord." 
02Ex 32:6 They got up early the next day and offered burnt offerings and brought peace offerings. Then the people sat down to eat and drink, and then they got up to play.
02Ex 32:7 The Lord said to Moses, "Go down immediately, for your people whom you led out of Egypt have behaved corruptly. 
02Ex 32:8 They have been quick to turn aside from the way I commanded them, and they have made for themselves a molten calf. They have bowed down to it in worship, they have offered sacrifices to it, and they have said, 'This, Israel, is your god who brought you out of the land of Egypt.'"
02Ex 32:9 Then the Lord said to Moses, "I've seen these people and indeed they're obstinate. 
02Ex 32:10 Now let me alone so that my anger may burn against them and that I may consume them, but I'll make a great nation of you."
02Ex 32:11 But Moses implored the Lord his God£º "Lord, why are you angry with your people whom you brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a show of force -  
02Ex 32:12 Why should the Egyptians say, 'He brought them out with an evil intention to kill them in the mountains and to destroy them from the face of the earth' -  Turn from your anger and change your mind about the calamity against your people. 
02Ex 32:13 Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, your servants to whom you swore by yourself as you said to them, 'I'll increase the number of your descendants like the stars of the heavens, I'll give your descendants all of this land about which I have spoken, and they are to possess it forever.'"
02Ex 32:14 So the Lord changed his mind about the calamity he had said he would bring on his people.
02Ex 32:15 Then Moses turned and went down the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand, tablets which were written on both sides. They were written on one side and the other. 
02Ex 32:16 The tablets were the work of God and the writing was God's writing, inscribed on the tablets. 
02Ex 32:17 When Joshua heard the sound of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, "The sound of war is coming from the camp."16
02Ex 32:18 Moses said, "It is not the sound of a victory shout, and it's not the sound of a shout of defeat, but it's the sound of singing that I hear."
02Ex 32:19 As Moses approached the camp and saw the calf and the dancing, he became angry. He threw the tablets from his hands and shattered them at the base of the mountain. 
02Ex 32:20 He took the calf that they had made, burned it with fire, and ground it into powder. He scattered it on the water and made the Israelites drink it.
02Ex 32:21 Then Moses said to Aaron, "What did this people do to you that you brought such great sin upon them?"
02Ex 32:22 Aaron said, "Sir, don't be angry. You know the people - that they're intent on evil. 23They told me, 'Make a god for us who will go before us because, as for this fellow Moses who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we don't know what has become of him.' 
02Ex 32:24 So I said to them, 'Whoever has gold ornaments, tear them off.' When they gave it to me, I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf."
02Ex 32:25 When Moses saw that the people were out of control - for Aaron had let them get out of control, something that brought ridicule from their enemies - 
02Ex 32:26 he stood in the gate of the camp and called out£º "Whoever is for the Lord come over to me," and all the sons of Levi gathered around him. 
02Ex 32:27 He said to them, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel, says, 'Every man put his sword on his thigh, and go back and forth from gate to gate in the camp, and each of you kill his brother and friend and neighbor.'"32
02Ex 32:28 The Levites did just as Moses told them, and about 3,000 people died that day. 
02Ex 32:29 Moses said, "You have been ordained to serve the Lord today, and you have brought a blessing on yourselves today because every man opposed his son or brother."
02Ex 32:30 The next day Moses said to the people, "You committed a great sin, and now I'll go up to the Lord, and perhaps I can make atonement for your sin."
02Ex 32:31 Moses returned to the Lord and said, "Please, Lord, this people committed a great sin by making a god of gold for themselves. 
02Ex 32:32 Now, if you will, forgive their sin - but if not, blot me out of your book which you have written."
02Ex 32:33 The Lord said to Moses, "Whoever sins against me, I'll blot him out of my book. 
02Ex 32:34 Now, go, and lead the people where I told you, and now my angel will go before you, but on the day when I do punish, I'll punish them for their sin." 
02Ex 32:35 Then the Lord sent a plague on the people because they made the calf (the one Aaron made).
02Ex 33:1 The Lord said to Moses, "Go up from here, you and the people whom you brought out of Egypt, to the land about which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob saying, 'I'll give it to your descendants.' 
02Ex 33:2 I'll send an angel in front of you and I'll drive out the Canaanites, the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
02Ex 33:3 Go up to a land flowing with milk and honey, but I won't go up among you, because you are an obstinate people, and otherwise I might consume you along the way."
02Ex 33:4 When the people heard this troubling word, they mourned, and no one put on his ornaments. 
02Ex 33:5 The Lord had said to Moses, "Say to the Israelites, 'You are an obstinate people, and if for one moment I went up among you, I would put an end to you. Now take off your ornaments so I may decide what to do with you.'" 
02Ex 33:6 So the Israelites did not wear their ornaments from Mount Horeb onward.5
02Ex 33:7 Moses used to take the tent and set it up outside the camp at a distance from the camp, and he called it the Tent of Meeting. When anyone sought the Lord, he would go out to the Tent of Meeting which was outside the camp. 
02Ex 33:8 When Moses would go out to the tent, all the people would get up, and each would stand in the doorway of his tent, watching Moses until he entered the tent. 
02Ex 33:9 When Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would come down and stand at the doorway of the tent while God spoke with Moses. 
02Ex 33:10 When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the doorway of the tent, all of them would get up and prostrate themselves in worship, each one at the doorway of his tent. 
02Ex 33:11 The Lord would speak to Moses face to face just as a man speaks with his friend. When Moses returned to the camp, Nun's son Joshua, his young servant, would not leave the tent.
02Ex 33:12 Moses said to the Lord, "Look, you have told me, 'Bring up this people,' but you haven't let me know whom you will send with me. Yet you have said, 'I know you by name,' and also, 'You have found favor in my sight.' 
02Ex 33:13 Now, if I've found favor in your sight, please show me your ways so I may know you in order to find favor in your sight. And remember, this nation is your people."
02Ex 33:14 He said, "My presence will go with you, and I'll give you rest." 
02Ex 33:15 Then Moses said to the Lord, "If your presence does not go with us, don't bring us up from here. 
02Ex 33:16 For how shall it be known that your people and I have received favor from you, unless you go with us and that we, your people and I, are distinguished from all the people on the face of the earth?"
02Ex 33:17 The Lord said to Moses, "I'll do the very thing that you have said, because you have found favor in my sight and I know you by name."
02Ex 33:18 Then Moses said, "Please show me your glory."
02Ex 33:19 God said, "I'll cause all my goodness to pass before you, and I'll proclaim the name 'the Lord' before you. I'll be gracious to whom I'll be gracious, and I'll show compassion on whom I'll show compassion. 
02Ex 33:20 But," he said, "You cannot see my face, because a man cannot see me and live.
02Ex 33:21 The Lord said, "Look, there is a place near me where you can stand on the rock; 
02Ex 33:22 and as my glory passes by, I'll put you in a crevice in the rock, and cover you with my hand until I've passed by. 
02Ex 33:23 Then I'll remove my hand so you may see my back, but my face must not be seen."33
02Ex 34:1 The Lord said to Moses, "Cut out for yourself two stone tablets like the first ones, and I'll write on the tablets the words which were on the first tablets which you broke. 
02Ex 34:2 Be ready in the morning, and come up in the morning on Mount Sinai, where you are to present yourself to me there on the top of the mountain. 
02Ex 34:3 No one shall come up with you, nor shall anyone be seen anywhere on the mountain. Also, the sheep and cattle shall not graze in front of that mountain."
02Ex 34:4 Moses cut out the two stone tablets like the first ones, got up early in the morning, and climbed Mount Sinai, just as the Lord had commanded him. He took with him the two stone tablets. 
02Ex 34:5 The Lord came down in a cloud and stood there with him and proclaimed the name of the Lord. 
02Ex 34:6 The Lord passed in front of him and proclaimed, "The Lord, the Lord God  is compassionate and gracious. He is slow to anger, and filled with gracious love and truth.
02Ex 34:7 "He graciously loves thousands, and forgives iniquity, transgression, and sin. But he does not leave the guilty unpunished, visiting the iniquity of the ancestors on their children, and on their children's children to the third and fourth generation."
02Ex 34:8 Moses quickly bowed to the ground and prostrated himself in worship. 
02Ex 34:9 He said, "If I've found favor in your sight, Lord, please, Lord, walk among us. Certainly this is an obstinate people, but pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us for your own inheritance."
02Ex 34:10 Then the Lord said, "Now I'm going to make a covenant. Before all your people I'll do miraculous deeds that haven't been done in all the earth or in any nation. All the people among whom you live will see the work of the Lord, for it's an awesome thing that I'll do with you. 
02Ex 34:11 Obey what I am commanding you today. I'll drive out from before you the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. 
02Ex 34:12 Be very careful not to make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land to which you are going, so they won't be a snare among you. 
02Ex 34:13 Rather, you are to tear down their altars, you are to smash their sacred pillars, and you are to cut down their sacred poles - 
02Ex 34:14 indeed, you are not to bow down in worship to any other god, because the Lord's name is Jealous - he's a jealous God - 
02Ex 34:15 Otherwise, you may make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and when they prostitute themselves with their gods and offer sacrifices to their gods, someone may invite you and then you may eat some of their sacrifices. 
02Ex 34:16 You are not to take any of their daughters for your sons. Otherwise, when their daughters prostitute themselves with their gods, they may cause your sons to prostitute themselves with their gods."
02Ex 34:17 "You are not to make molten gods for yourselves. 
02Ex 34:18 "You are to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread. For seven days, at the appointed time in the month Abib, you are to eat unleavened bread as I commanded you, for in the month Abib you came out of Egypt.
02Ex 34:19 "Everything firstborn belongs to me£º all the males of your herds, the firstborn of both cattle and sheep. 
02Ex 34:20 You are to redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a sheep, and if you don't redeem it, you are to break its neck. You are to redeem every firstborn of your sons, and no one shall appear before me empty-handed.19
02Ex 34:21 "For six days you are to work, but on the seventh day you are to rest; even during plowing time and harvest you are to rest.
02Ex 34:22 "You are to observe the Festival of Weeks, the first fruits of the wheat harvest, and the Festival of Ingathering at the turn of the year. 
02Ex 34:23 Three times during the year all your males shall appear in the presence of the Lord God of Israel. 
02Ex 34:24 For I'll drive out nations before you, and enlarge your borders, and no one will covet your land when you go up to appear in the presence of the Lord your God three times a year.
02Ex 34:25 "You are not to offer the blood of my sacrifice with anything leavened, nor shall you allow the sacrifice of the Festival of Passover to remain until morning.
02Ex 34:26 "You are to bring the best of the first fruits of the ground to the house of the Lord your God. "You are not to boil a young goat in its mother's milk."
02Ex 34:27 Then the Lord said to Moses, "Write down these words, for I'm making a covenant with you and with Israel according to these words." 
02Ex 34:28 While Moses was there with the Lord for 40 days and 40 nights, he did not eat or drink. He wrote the Ten Commandments, the words of the covenant, on the tablets.
02Ex 34:29 When Moses came down from Mount Sinai, he had the two tablets in his hand, and he did not know that the skin of his face was ablaze with light because he had been speaking with God. 
02Ex 34:30 Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses and immediately noticed that the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him. 
02Ex 34:31 When Moses called to them, Aaron and the leaders of the congregation returned to him, and he spoke to them. 
02Ex 34:32 Afterwards all the Israelites came near and he gave them everything the Lord told him on Mount Sinai as commandments.3430
02Ex 34:33 When Moses finished speaking with them he put a veil over his face, 
02Ex 34:34 and then whenever Moses would come in the Lord's presence to speak with him, he would remove the veil until he left the Lord's presence. When he went out, he would tell the Israelites what he had been commanded. 
02Ex 34:35 The Israelites would see the face of Moses and that the skin of his face shone; then Moses would put the veil back over his face until he went in to speak with God.
02Ex 35:1 M oses assembled the entire congregation of the Israelites and said to them, "These are the things that the Lord has commanded you to do£º 
02Ex 35:2 For six days work shall be done, but on the seventh day you are to have a holy day, a Sabbath of complete rest in dedication to the Lord. Anyone who does work on that day shall be executed. 
02Ex 35:3 You are not to light a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath."
02Ex 35:4 Then Moses said to the entire congregation of the Israelites, "This is what the Lord has commanded, 
02Ex 35:5 'Take from among yourselves an offering for the Lord. Everyone whose heart is willing shall bring it as an offering for the Lord£º gold, silver, and bronze; 
02Ex 35:6 blue, purple, and scarlet material; fine linen and goat hair; 
02Ex 35:7 ram skins dyed red, dolphin skins, acacia wood, 
02Ex 35:8 oil for lighting, spices for the anointing oil and for aromatic incense, 
02Ex 35:9 onyx stones, and stones for setting in the ephod and the breast piece.
02Ex 35:10 'Let everyone who is skilled among you come and make everything that the Lord has commanded£º 
02Ex 35:11 the tabernacle, its tent, its covering, its clasps, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets, 
02Ex 35:12 the ark, its poles, the Mercy Seat, the curtain, 
02Ex 35:13 the table, its poles, all its furnishings, and the bread of the presence, 
02Ex 35:14 the lamp stand for light, its furnishings, its lamps, and oil for the light, 
02Ex 35:15 the altar of incense, its poles, the anointing oil, the aromatic incense, and the screen for the doorway at the entrance to the tabernacle, 
02Ex 35:16 the altar for burnt offerings, the bronze lattice for it, its poles, and all its furnishings, the basin and its base, 
02Ex 35:17 the hangings for the court, its pillars, its sockets, the screen for the gate of the court, 
02Ex 35:18 the pegs for the tabernacle, the pegs for the court, and their cords, 
02Ex 35:19 the woven garments for ministering in the Holy Place, the holy garments of Aaron the priest and the garments of his sons for serving as priests.'"
02Ex 35:20 Then the entire congregation of the Israelites withdrew from Moses' presence, 
02Ex 35:21 and every person whose heart moved him and all whose spirits prompted them, brought an offering to the Lord for constructing the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the holy garments. 
02Ex 35:22 Both the men and women came, all whose hearts prompted them, and brought brooches, earrings, rings, pendants, and all kinds of gold jewelry. Every person presented a wave offering of gold to the Lord. 
02Ex 35:23 Everyone who had blue, purple, and scarlet material, fine linen, goat hair, ram skins dyed red, and dolphin skins brought them. 
02Ex 35:24 Everyone who could give an offering of silver and bronze brought it as a contribution for the Lord. Also all who had acacia wood for any use in the work brought it.22
02Ex 35:25 Every skilled woman spun with her hands, and brought what she spun£º blue, purple, and scarlet material, and fine linen. 
02Ex 35:26 All the women who were skilled artisans spun the goat hair.
02Ex 35:27 The leaders brought onyx stones and stones to be set in the ephod and the breast piece,
02Ex 35:28 spices and oil for the light and for the anointing oil and the aromatic incense. 
02Ex 35:29 Each Israelite man and woman whose heart was prompted brought something as a freewill offering to the Lord for all the work which the Lord had commanded them to do through Moses.
02Ex 35:30 Moses said to the Israelites, "Look, the Lord has called Uri's son Bezalel, grandson of Hur, from the tribe of Judah, 
02Ex 35:31 and he has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom, with understanding, and with knowledge of all kinds of work, 
02Ex 35:32 to make artistic designs, to work in gold, silver, and bronze, 
02Ex 35:33 to cut stones for setting, to carve wood, and to engage in all kinds of artistic work. 
02Ex 35:34 And he has given both him and Ahisamach's son Oholiab from the tribe of Dan the ability to teach. 
02Ex 35:35 He has equipped them to do all kinds of work done by an engraver, designer, embroider in blue, purple and scarlet material and in fine linen, or as a weaver. They were able to do all kinds of work and were skilled designers. 
02Ex 36:1 Bezalel and Oholiab and all the skilled craftsmen to whom the Lord gave wisdom and understanding to know how to do all the work in constructing the sanctuary shall do everything that the Lord has commanded."3
02Ex 36:2 Then Moses summoned Bezalel, Oholiab, and all the skilled people to whom the Lord had given ability, including everyone whose hearts stirred them to come forward to do the work. 
02Ex 36:3 They received from Moses all the offerings that the Israelites had brought for doing the work of constructing the sanctuary, and the people continued to bring freewill offerings every morning. 
02Ex 36:4 All the craftsmen who were doing all the work on the sanctuary left the work they were doing 
02Ex 36:5 and said to Moses, "The people are bringing much more than enough for the work that the Lord has commanded us to do." 
02Ex 36:6 Then Moses issued an order, and the message was taken throughout the camp, "Men and women, don't bring more offerings for the sanctuary." The people were restrained from bringing any more, 
02Ex 36:7 since the material was more than sufficient for doing all the work.
02Ex 36:8 All the skilled craftsmen among the workers made the tabernacle with ten curtains of fine woven linen, blue, purple, and scarlet material. He made them with cherubim skillfully worked into them. 
02Ex 36:9 The length of each curtain was 42 feet, and the width of each curtain six feet. All the curtains had the same measurements. 
02Ex 36:10 He joined five of the curtains together, and the other five curtains he joined together. 
02Ex 36:11 He made loops of blue material along the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set, and likewise, he made loops along the edge of the outermost curtain in the second set. 
02Ex 36:12 He made 50 loops in the one curtain, and he made 50 loops along the edge of the curtain that is in the second set, with the loops opposite each other. 
02Ex 36:13 Then he made 50 gold clasps, and joined the curtains to each other with the clasps so the tabernacle was one piece.
02Ex 36:14 He made curtains of goat hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made 11 curtains. 
02Ex 36:15 The length of each curtain was 45 feet, and the width of each curtain six feet; the measurements of each of the eleven curtains was the same. 
02Ex 36:16 He joined five curtains by themselves, and six curtains by themselves. 
02Ex 36:17 He made 50 loops along the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set, and 50 loops along the edge of the curtain of the other set. 
02Ex 36:18 He made 50 bronze clasps to join the tent together so it would be one piece. 
02Ex 36:19 Then he made a cover for the tent of ram skins dyed red and a covering of dolphin skins above that.
02Ex 36:20 Then he made upright boards of acacia wood for the tabernacle. 
02Ex 36:21 Each board was fifteen feet long, and 27 inches wide. 
02Ex 36:22 Each board had two pegs, joined to one another, and he did this for all the boards of the tabernacle. 
02Ex 36:23 He made the boards for the tabernacle£º twenty boards for the south side. 
02Ex 36:24 He made 40 silver sockets under the twenty boards£º two sockets under one board for its two pegs and two sockets under the next board for its two pegs. 
02Ex 36:25 For the second side of the tabernacle to the north he made twenty boards, 
02Ex 36:26 and 40 silver sockets for them, two sockets under one board and two sockets under the next board. 
02Ex 36:27 For the rear of the tabernacle on the west he made six boards, 
02Ex 36:28 and he made two boards for the rear corners of the tabernacle. 
02Ex 36:29 They were joined together at the bottom and they were connected on top, by one ring. He did this for the two of them, and they were the two corners. 
02Ex 36:30 There were eight boards with their sixteen silver sockets, two sockets under each board.22
02Ex 36:31 Then he made bars of acacia wood, five for the boards on one side of the tabernacle, 
02Ex 36:32 five bars for the boards on the second side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards on the back side of the tabernacle to the west. 
02Ex 36:33 He made the middle bar in the center of the boards pass through from end to end. 
02Ex 36:34 He overlaid the boards with gold, and made gold rings for them as holders for the bars, and he overlaid the bars with gold.36
02Ex 36:35 He made a curtain of blue, purple, and scarlet material, and fine woven linen. He made it with cherubim skillfully worked into it. 
02Ex 36:36 He made four pillars of acacia for it and overlaid them with gold, along with their gold hooks, and he cast four silver sockets for them. 
02Ex 36:37 For the doorway of the tent, he made a screen of blue, purple, and scarlet material and fine woven linen, the work of an embroiderer, 
02Ex 36:38 and five pillars of acacia along with their hooks. He overlaid their tops and their bands with gold. Their five sockets were of bronze.
02Ex 37:1 Bezalel made the ark of acacia wood 45 inches long, 27 inches wide, and 27 inches high. 
02Ex 37:2 He overlaid it with pure gold, inside and outside, and made a gold molding around it. 
02Ex 37:3 He cast four rings for it on its four feet, two rings on one side of it and two rings on its other side. 
02Ex 37:4 He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
02Ex 37:5 He put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry the ark.
02Ex 37:6 He made a Mercy Seat of pure gold 45 inches long and 27 inches wide. 
02Ex 37:7 He made two cherubim of gold; he made them of hammered work at the two ends of the Mercy Seat. 
02Ex 37:8 One cherub was at one end and one cherub at the other end. He made the cherubim at the two ends of the Mercy Seat and of one piece with it. 
02Ex 37:9 The cherubim had their wings spread upward, covering the Mercy Seat with their wings and facing each other. The faces of the cherubim were turned toward the Mercy Seat.
02Ex 37:10 Then he made a table of acacia wood three feet long, one and a half feet wide, and 27 inches high. 
02Ex 37:11 He overlaid it with pure gold and put a gold molding around it. 
02Ex 37:12 He made a three-inch wide rim around it, and made a gold molding around the rim. 
02Ex 37:13 He cast four gold rings for it and put the rings on the four corners where its four feet were. 
02Ex 37:14 The rings were close to the rim as holders for the poles to carry the table. 
02Ex 37:15 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold to carry the table. 
02Ex 37:16 He made the utensils which were on the table, its plates, dishes, bowls, and jars out of which libations are poured. He made them of pure gold.
02Ex 37:17 He made the lamp stand of pure gold. He made the lamp stand, its base, and stem of hammered work and its cups, calyxes, and flowers were of one piece with it. 
02Ex 37:18 Six branches extended from its sides, three branches of the lamp stand from one side of it, and three branches of the lamp stand from its other side. 
02Ex 37:19 Three cups shaped like almond blossoms with calyxes and flowers were on one branch and three cups shaped like almond blossoms with calyxes and flowers were on the other branch, and so on for the six branches extending from the lamp stand. 
02Ex 37:20 On the lamp stand itself there were four cups shaped like almond blossoms each with their calyxes and flowers. 
02Ex 37:21 A calyx was under the two branches that extended out of the stem; a calyx was under the next pair of branches that extended out of the stem; and a calyx was under the last pair of branches that extended out of the stem, and so on for the six branches extending from the lamp stand. 
02Ex 37:22 Their calyxes and their branches were of one piece with it, all of it was of one piece of hammered work of pure gold. 
02Ex 37:23 He made its seven lamps, its tongs and its trays of pure gold. 
02Ex 37:24 He made it and all of its furnishings from a talent of pure gold.23
02Ex 37:25 He made the altar for burning incense of acacia wood, a square, one and a half feet long, one and a half feet wide, and three feet high, with its horns of one piece with it. 
02Ex 37:26 He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, its sides all around, and its horns, and he made a gold molding around it. 
02Ex 37:27 He made two gold rings for it under its molding, on its two opposite sides as holders for poles by which to carry it. 
02Ex 37:28 He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 
02Ex 37:29 And he made the holy anointing oil and the pure aromatic incense, the work of a perfumer.37
02Ex 38:1 Then he made the altar for burnt offerings of acacia wood. It was a square, seven and a half feet long and seven and a half feet wide, and it was four and a half feet high. 
02Ex 38:2 He made horns on its four corners. Its horns were of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with bronze. 
02Ex 38:3 He made all the utensils for the altar, the pans, the shovels, the bowls, the forks, and the fire-pans, and he made all its utensils of bronze. 
02Ex 38:4 He made a lattice, a netting of bronze, for the altar. It was under its ledge, extending halfway up. 
02Ex 38:5 He cast four rings on the four ends of the bronze lattice as holders for the poles. 
02Ex 38:6 He made poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. 
02Ex 38:7 And he put the poles through rings on the sides of the altar to carry it. He made it hollow, out of boards.
02Ex 38:8 He made the bronze basin and its bronze base from mirrors contributed by the women who served in the doorway of the Tent of Meeting.
02Ex 38:9 Then hemadethecourt.Onthesouth side the hangings for the court were of fine woven linen, 150 feet long. 
02Ex 38:10 He made their twenty pillars and their twenty sockets of bronze, while the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver. 
02Ex 38:11 The north side was 150 feet long, and its 20 pillars and 20 sockets were of bronze, and the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver. 
02Ex 38:12 For the west side there were hangings 75 feet long with their ten pillars and ten sockets. The hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver. 
02Ex 38:13 The east side was 75 feet long. 
02Ex 38:14 The hangings for one section were 22 and a half feet with their three pillars and three sockets, 
02Ex 38:15 and also for the second section. On either side of the gate of the court were hangings of 22 and a half feet with their three pillars and three sockets. 
02Ex 38:16 All the hangings around the court were of fine woven linen. 
02Ex 38:17 The sockets for the pillars were of bronze and the hooks of the pillars and their bands were of silver. Their tops were overlaid with silver, and all the pillars of the court were banded with silver. 
02Ex 38:18 The screen of the gate of the court was the work of an embroiderer of blue, purple and scarlet material, and fine woven linen. The length was 30 feet and it was seven and a half feet high along its width, corresponding to the hangings of the court.

02Ex 38:21 Here is a summary of materials for the tabernacle of the Testimony that was compiled at Moses's direction, the work of the Levites under the direction of Aaron the priest's son Ithamar. 
02Ex 38:22 Now Uri's son Bezalel, grandson of Hur from the tribe of Judah, made everything that the Lord had ordered Moses to build. 
02Ex 38:23 With him was Ahisamach's son Oholiab from the tribe of Dan, an engraver, designer, and embroiderer in blue, purple, and scarlet material, and of fine linen.21
02Ex 38:24 All the gold that was used in the work, in all the work on the sanctuary, including the gold from the wave offering, totaled 29 talents, 730 shekels, according to the standard used in the sanctuary. 
02Ex 38:25 The silver from those of the congregation who were recorded totaled 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the standard used in the sanctuary; 
02Ex 38:26 a beka a head (a beka is half a shekel, according to the standard used in the sanctuary) for everyone who went through the registration process from 20 years old and older. The total numbered 603,550 bekas.38
02Ex 38:27 One hundred talents of silver were used to cast the sockets for the sanctuary and the sockets for the curtain, 100 sockets for 100 talents, a talent per socket. 
02Ex 38:28 And with 1,775 talents he made hooks for the pillars, overlaid their tops, and made bands for them. 
02Ex 38:29 The bronze from the wave offering totaled 70 talents and 2,400 shekels.

02Ex 40:8 You are to set up the court all around, and hang up the screen for the gate of the court. 
02Ex 40:9 You are to take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it. You are to consecrate it and all its furnishings and it will be holy.8
02Ex 40:10 "You are to anoint the altar for burnt offerings and all its utensils. You are to consecrate the altar and the altar will be most holy. 
02Ex 40:11 You are to anoint the basin and its base and consecrate it. 
02Ex 40:12 Then you are to bring Aaron and his sons to the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, and wash them with water. 
02Ex 40:13 You are to clothe Aaron with the holy garments, you are to anoint him, and consecrate him so he may serve me as priest. 
02Ex 40:14 You are to bring his sons and clothe them with tunics. 
02Ex 40:15 You are to anoint them just as you anointed their father so they may serve me as priests. Their anointing shall qualify them to belong to a perpetual priesthood from generation to generation."
02Ex 40:16 Moses did everything that the Lord had commanded him, so he did. 
02Ex 40:17 And so in the first month of the second year, on the first day of the month, the tabernacle was set up. 
02Ex 40:18 Moses set up the tabernacle. He installed its sockets and set its boards in place. He inserted its bars and set up its pillars. 
02Ex 40:19 He spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent on top of it, just as the Lord had commanded him. 
02Ex 40:20 Then he took the Testimony, put it into the ark, and placed the poles on the ark. He then put the Mercy Seat on top of the ark. 
02Ex 40:21 He brought the ark into the tabernacle, set up the curtain, and screened off the Ark of the Testimony, just as the Lord had commanded him. 
02Ex 40:22 He put the table in the Tent of Meeting, on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the curtain, 
02Ex 40:23 and properly arranged the bread on it in the Lord's presence, just as the Lord had commanded him.
02Ex 40:24 Then he put the lamp stand in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle, 
02Ex 40:25 and set up the lamps in the Lord's presence, just as the Lord had commanded him. 
02Ex 40:26 He put the golden altar in the Tent of Meeting in front of the curtain 
02Ex 40:27 and burned aromatic incense on it, just as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
02Ex 40:28 He set up the screen for the doorway of the tabernacle. 
02Ex 40:29 He put the altar for burnt offerings at the doorway of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and offered the burnt offering and the grain offering on it, just as the Lord had commanded him. 
02Ex 40:30 He put the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar, and put water in it for washing. 
02Ex 40:31 Moses, Aaron, and his sons washed their hands and feet from it. 
02Ex 40:32 When they entered the Tent of Meeting and approached the altar, they washed, just as the Lord had commanded him. 
02Ex 40:33 He set up the court all around the tabernacle and the altar, and hung up the screen for the gate of the court. And so Moses finished the work.32
02Ex 40:34 The cloud covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. 
02Ex 40:35 Moses was not able to enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud had settled on it, and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. 
02Ex 40:36 Whenever the cloud was lifted up from the tabernacle, the Israelites would set out on their journey, 
02Ex 40:37 but if the cloud was not lifted up, they would not set out until it was lifted up. 
02Ex 40:38 For the cloud of the Lord was over the tabernacle by day, and the fire was in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel in all their journeys.

03Lv 6:5 or the thing about which he had given a false oath. He is to restore it in full, add a fifth to it, then give to whom it belongs the very day he's found guilty.
03Lv 6:6 "Now as to his guilt offering, he is to bring to the Lord a ram without defect from the flock, estimated as to its value, to the priest. 
03Lv 6:7 Then the priest is to make atonement for him in the Lord's presence, and it will be forgiven him regarding whatever he did. 
03Lv 6:8 The Lord spoke to Moses£º 
03Lv 6:9 "Deliver these orders to Aaron and his sons concerning the regulations for burnt offerings. The burnt offering is to remain on the hearth of the altar throughout the entire night until morning, and the fire on the altar is to be kept burning along with it.
03Lv 6:10 "The priest is to clothe himself with linen robe and underclothes. Then he is to take the ashes of the burnt offering on the altar that had been consumed by the fire and set them beside the altar. 
03Lv 6:11 Then he is to change his clothes, dressing himself with a different set of clothes, and take the ashes to a clean place outside the camp.
03Lv 6:12 "The fire on the altar is to be kept burning continuously without being extinguished. The priest is to burn wood on it every morning, arrange burnt offerings over it, and then burn the fat contained in the peace offerings over it. 
03Lv 6:13 The fire is to continue to burn on the altar and is never to be extinguished."
03Lv 6:14 "This is the law concerning grain offerings. Aaron's sons are to offer it in the Lord's presence, in front of the altar. 
03Lv 6:15 He is to take a handful of fine flour for a grain offering, some olive oil, all of the frankincense on the grain offering, and make a sacrifice of smoke on the altar as a memorial portion, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
03Lv 6:16 "Aaron and his sons are to eat what remains of the unleavened offering at this sacred place£º the court of the tent of meeting. 
03Lv 6:17 It is not to be baked with leaven. I've given it as their portion out of my offerings made by fire. It's a most holy thing, like the sin and guilt offerings. 
03Lv 6:18 Every male of Aaron's sons is to eat it as a portion continuously allotted for your generations from the offerings made by fire to the Lord. Anyone who touches them is to be holy."
03Lv 6:19 Then the Lord told Moses,
03Lv 6:20 "This is the offering that Aaron and his sons are to offer to the Lord the day he is anointed£º a tenth of an ephah of flour is to be offered throughout the day, half in the morning and half in the evening. 
03Lv 6:21 It is to be prepared with olive oil on a griddle. Once is has been mixed thoroughly, bake it, bring it in pieces, and offer it like a grain offering of broken pieces, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. 
03Lv 6:22 The anointed priest who succeeds him from among his sons is to offer it. As a permanent statute, it is to be offered whole and made to smoke in the Lord's presence. 
03Lv 6:23 Every grain offering from a priest is to be burned whole. It is not to be eaten."
03Lv 6:24 Then the Lord told Moses, 
03Lv 6:25 "Speak to Aaron and his sons. This is the regulation concerning sin offerings. Slaughter the sin offering in the same place where the whole burnt offering is slaughtered - in the Lord's presence. It's a most holy thing. 
03Lv 6:26 The priest who offers it as a sin offering is to eat it at a sacred place in the court of the tent of meeting. 
03Lv 6:27 Whoever touches its meat will be holy. "If some of its blood spatters on a garment, wash where it was spattered in a sacred place. 
03Lv 6:28 The earthen vessel in which it was boiled is to be broken, unless it was boiled in a bronze vessel, in which case it is to be polished very well and rinsed in water.
03Lv 6:29 "Every male among the priests is to eat it. It's a most sacred thing. 
03Lv 6:30 Any sin offering from which its blood was brought to the tent of meeting to make atonement in the sacred place is not to be eaten. Instead, it is to be incinerated."
03Lv 7:1 "This is the regulation concerning guilt offerings. It's most holy. 
03Lv 7:2 The guilt offering is to be offered in the same place where the burnt offering is slaughtered. The priest is to spatter some of its blood on the altar and around it. 
03Lv 7:3 As to all its fat, that is, the fat on the tail and the fat covering the internal organs, the one presenting the sacrifice is to offer it. 
03Lv 7:4 But the two kidneys, the fat over them by the loins, and the appendage on the liver is to be taken away, along with the kidneys. 
03Lv 7:5 Then the priest is to offer them on the altar, incinerating them with fire as a guilt offering to the Lord. 
03Lv 7:6 Any male among the priests may eat it, provided that it is eaten at a sacred place as a most holy thing. 
03Lv 7:7 The law for the sin offering is the same as the guilt offering. It belongs to the priest who made atonement with it.
03Lv 7:8 "The hide from the burnt offering brought by the offeror is to belong to the priest.
03Lv 7:9 Every grain offering that's baked on the oven and every thing that's prepared on a stew pan or on the frying pan belongs to the priest who offered it. 
03Lv 7:10 Furthermore, every grain offering that's mixed with olive oil or that's dry will be for Aaron's sons, each one like the other. 
03Lv 7:11 "This is the law concerning the sacrifice for peace offerings that are to be brought to the Lord. 
03Lv 7:12 If someone brings it to demonstrate thanksgiving, then he is to present along with the thanksgiving offering unleavened cakes mixed with olive oil, unleavened wafers spread with olive oil, and cakes of mixed fine flour with olive oil. 
03Lv 7:13 Along with the cakes of unleavened bread, he is to bring his thanksgiving offering with his peace offerings. 
03Lv 7:14 He is to present one from each grain offering, a separate offering to the Lord. It will belong to the priest who spatters the blood of the peace offering. 
03Lv 7:15 As to the meat contained in his peace offerings, it is to be eaten on the day it is offered. Nothing of it is to remain until morning.13
03Lv 7:16 "If his sacrifice accompanies a fulfilled vow or is a voluntary offering, it is to be eaten on the day the offeror brings the sacrifice. Anything left over is to be eaten the next day, 
03Lv 7:17 but whatever remains uneaten from the meat of the sacrifice by the third day is to be incinerated.
03Lv 7:18 "If any of the meat of his sacrifice of peace offerings is eaten on the third day, it won't be accepted for the one who brought it. It is to be considered as refuse, and whoever eats it will bear the punishment of his iniquity. 
03Lv 7:19 "Meat that comes in contact with a ceremonially unclean thing is not to be eaten. Incinerate it instead. As for ceremonially clean meat, any one who is clean may eat it. 
03Lv 7:20 But the person who eats meat from the sacrifice that belongs to the Lord, while still affected by his uncleanness is to be eliminated from contact with his people. 
03Lv 7:21 Any person who touches a ceremonially unclean thing - whether the uncleanness pertains to human beings, animals, or to creeping things - and then eats from the meat of peace offerings that belongs to the Lord is to be eliminated from contact with his people."
03Lv 7:22 The Lord spoke to Moses£º 
03Lv 7:23 "Tell the Israelites£º You are not to eat the fat of an ox, a lamb, or a goat.
03Lv 7:24 "The carcass of an animal that died of its own and an animal torn by wild beast may be used for any purpose except for eating.
03Lv 7:25 "Anyone who eats the fat of an animal that has been offered by fire to the Lord is to be eliminated from contact with his people. 
03Lv 7:26 You are not to eat any form of blood in any of your dwellings, whether it's from birds or animals. 
03Lv 7:27 Any person who eats any form of blood is to be eliminated from contact with his people."
03Lv 7:28 The Lord spoke to Moses£º 
03Lv 7:29 Tell the Israelites£º "Whoever brings a peace offering sacrifice to the Lord is to bring his offering to the Lord from the sacrifice of his peace offerings. 
03Lv 7:30 He is to bring the offering made by fire with his own hands to the Lord. He is to bring the fat with the breast, since the breast is to be waved as a raised offering to the Lord. 
03Lv 7:31 The priest will burn the fat on the altar, but the breast belongs to Aaron and his sons. 
03Lv 7:32 From the sacrifices of your peace offerings give the right thigh to the priest as a raised offering to the Lord.
03Lv 7:33 "The descendant of Aaron's sons who brings the blood from the peace offering and the fat will have the right thigh for his own portion, 
03Lv 7:34 since I've taken the breast and the thigh as raised offerings from the sacrifices of peace offerings of the Israelites and have given them to Aaron the priest and his sons as their perpetual portion from the Israelites."
03Lv 7:35 This is the consecrated portion for Aaron and his descendants from the offerings made by fire to the Lord, the day they were presented to be priests to the Lord. 
03Lv 7:36 This is what the Lord had commanded to give them the day he anointed them from among the Israelites - a perpetual portion for their generations.
03Lv 7:37 This is the regulation concerning burnt, grain, sin, guilt, and installation offerings, along with the sacrifice for peace offerings. 
03Lv 7:38 This is what the Lord had commanded Moses on Mount Sinai on the day when he commanded the Israelites to bring their offerings to the Lord in the Sinai wilderness. 
03Lv 8:1 The Lord spoke to Moses£º 
03Lv 8:2 "Take Aaron, his sons with him, the clothing, the anointing oil, the bull for sin offering, two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread 
03Lv 8:3 and then assemble the entire congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
03Lv 8:4 So Moses did just as the Lord had commanded him. He assembled the congregation at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
03Lv 8:5 Moses said to the congregation, "This is what the Lord commanded to be done."
03Lv 8:6 Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water. 
03Lv 8:7 Then he clothed Aaron with the tunic, girded him with the band for priests, clothed him with the robe, placed the ephod on him, girded him with the skillfully weaved band of the ephod, and bound it on him. 
03Lv 8:8 He set the breastplate on him and placed the urim and thumin on top of the breastplate. 
03Lv 8:9 Then he set the turban on his head, and on the turban at the front he set the golden plate, the sacred crown that the Lord had commanded.
03Lv 8:10 After this, Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle, consecrating everything that was in it. 
03Lv 8:11 He spattered some on the altar seven times, then anointed the altar, all its vessels, the laver, and its base to consecrate them. 
03Lv 8:12 He then poured the oil of anointing on Aaron's head to anoint and consecrate him.
03Lv 8:13 Then Moses brought Aaron's sons, clothed them with the tunic, girded them with the bands, and bound turbans on them just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:14 Next, he brought the bull for sin offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the bull's head for a sin offering. 
03Lv 8:15 So Moses slaughtered it, took the blood, and poured some of it at the horns of the altar and around it with his fingers, thus purifying the altar. Then he poured the blood at the base of the altar, thereby sanctifying it as a means to make atonement with it.
03Lv 8:16 Moses burned on the altar all the fat on the internal organs, the appendage on the liver, the two kidneys, and the fat. 
03Lv 8:17 As to the bull and its fat, skin and offal, he incinerated them outside the camp, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:18 Next he brought the ram for whole burnt offering. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
03Lv 8:19 Moses slaughtered it and poured its blood over the altar and around it.
03Lv 8:20 As to the ram, he has cut it into parts at the joints. Moses burned the head, internal organs, and the fat.
03Lv 8:21 Moses washed the internal organs and the thigh with water and then burned the entire ram on the altar as a whole burnt offering, a pleasing aroma of an offering made by fire to the Lord, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
03Lv 8:22 Moses brought the ram, that is, the second of the rams for consecration. Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 
03Lv 8:23 Moses then slaughtered it, took some of its blood, and put it on Aaron's right earlobe, right thumb, and on his right great toe. 
03Lv 8:24 Then Moses brought Aaron's sons, took some of its blood, and put it on their right earlobes, on their right thumbs, and on their right great toes. Moses poured the blood on the altar and all around it. 
03Lv 8:25 Then he took the fat - from the tail, all the fat on the internal organs, the appendage of the liver, the two kidneys with the fat, and the right thigh. 
03Lv 8:26 From the basket of unleavened bread, which is in the Lord's presence, he took one piece of unleavened bread, one cake spread with olive oil, and one wafer, which he placed over the fat and the right thigh.
03Lv 8:27 He put all of these things in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and they all waved them in a raised offering to the Lord. 
03Lv 8:28 After this, Moses took those things from their hands and burned them on the altar over the whole burnt offering for consecration. They served as a pleasing aroma, an offering made by fire to the Lord.
03Lv 8:29 Moses took the breast and waved it as a raised offering in the Lord's presence as the portion that belonged to Moses from the ram of consecration, just as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
03Lv 8:30 Moses took some anointing oil and blood that was on the altar and spattered it on Aaron, on his clothes, on his sons, and on their clothes, consecrating Aaron, his clothes, his sons, and their clothes. 
03Lv 8:31 Then he said to Aaron and his sons, "Boil the meat at the entrance of the tent of meeting. There you may eat it along with the bread that is in the basket for consecration, just as I've commanded when I told him, 'Aaron and his sons may eat of it, 
03Lv 8:32 but the left over meat and bread is to be incinerated.'
03Lv 8:33 "Furthermore, you are not to go out past the entrance to the tent of meeting until the days of your ordination have been completed, since it will take seven days to ordain you. 
03Lv 8:34 What has been done today has been commanded by the Lord to make atonement for you. 
03Lv 8:35 Stay seven days and nights at the entrance of the tent of meeting and attend to the service of the Lord, so that you won't die, because this is what I've commanded."
03Lv 8:36 So Aaron and his sons did everything that the Lord had commanded through Moses.
03Lv 9:1 Eight days later, Moses called Aaron, his sons, and the elders of Israel. 
03Lv 9:2 He said to Aaron, "Take a young calf for a sin offering and a ram without defects for a whole burnt offering and bring them into the Lord's presence."
03Lv 9:3 He also told the Israelites, "Bring a male goat for a sin offering, a calf, a year old lamb without defects for a whole burnt offering, 
03Lv 9:4 an ox, a ram for a peace offering to sacrifice in the Lord's presence, and a grain offering with olive oil, because on that day the Lord will appear to you." 
03Lv 9:5 So they brought what Moses had commanded to the entrance of the tent of meeting. The entire congregation drew near and stood in the Lord's presence. 
03Lv 9:6 Then Moses said, "This is what the Lord commanded you to do so that the glory of the Lord may be revealed to you." 
03Lv 9:7 Moses then said to Aaron, "Approach the altar and bring your sin and whole burnt offerings. Make atonement for yourself and the people. Then bring the people's offering and make atonement for them, as the Lord commanded." 
03Lv 9:8 So Aaron drew near to the altar and slaughtered the calf for a sin offering on behalf of himself. 
03Lv 9:9 Next, Aaron's sons brought the blood to him and he dipped his fingers in the blood and placed it on the horns of the altar. As to the rest of the blood, he poured it at the base of the altar. 
03Lv 9:10 He incinerated the fat, kidneys, and the appendage from the liver of the sin offering, just as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
03Lv 9:11 He also incincerated the meat and skin outside the camp. 
03Lv 9:12 And so the burnt offering was slaughtered, and Aaron's sons secured for him the blood, which he poured on the altar and around it.
03Lv 9:13 As for the burnt offering, they delivered it to Aaron piece by piece, but he burned the head on the altar. 
03Lv 9:14 He washed the internal organs and the thighs and incinerated them on the altar, along with the whole burnt offering. 
03Lv 9:15 He brought the people's offering, presenting a goat for a sin offering on behalf of the people. He slaughtered it and offered it as the first sin offering. 
03Lv 9:16 Then he brought the whole burnt offering and offered it according to procedure.1
03Lv 9:17 Next, he brought the grain offering, filled his hand with it, and burned it on the altar next to the burnt offering for that morning. 
03Lv 9:18 He slaughtered the ox and ram for the peace offering sacrifice on behalf of the people. Aaron's sons delivered the blood to him, which he poured on the altar and around it. 
03Lv 9:19 As to the fat from the ox, ram, and the tail, the fat covering the kidneys, and the appendage of the liver, 
03Lv 9:20 they placed the fat on the breast and then he burned the fat on the altar. 
03Lv 9:21 Aaron waved the breast and the right thigh as a raised offering in the Lord's presence, just as Moses had commanded. 
03Lv 9:22 Aaron raised his hand toward the people and blessed them. Then he came down from the altar after offering the sin, whole burnt, and peace offerings.
03Lv 9:23 Moses and Aaron entered the tent of meeting. When they came out, they blessed the people and the glory of the Lord appeared to all the people. 
03Lv 9:24 A fire came down from the Lord's presence and consumed the burnt offering on the altar as well as the fat. When the people saw it, they shouted and fell on their faces.
03Lv 10:1 Aaron's sons Nadab and Abihu each took his own censer, placed fire in them, covered it with incense, and brought it into the Lord's presence as unauthorized fire that he had never prescribed for them. 
03Lv 10:2 So a fire came out from the Lord's presence, incinerated them, and they died while in the Lord's presence.
03Lv 10:3 Moses spoke with Aaron about what the Lord had said£º "Among those who are near me, I'll show myself holy so that I'll be glorified before all people." So Aaron remained silent. 
03Lv 10:4 Then Moses called on Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel, Aaron's uncle, and said£º "Come here and carry your brothers away from the sanctuary, outside the camp." 
03Lv 10:5 So they approached to carry them in their tunic outside the camp, just as Moses had commanded.
03Lv 10:6 Then Moses told Aaron and his sons Eliezar and Ithamar£º "You are not to loosen the hair of your head and you are not to rend your clothes. That way, you won't die and wrath won't come on the entire congregation. Your brothers and the assembly of Israel will mourn because of the fire that the Lord kindled. 
03Lv 10:7 Also, you are not to leave the entrance of the tent of meeting. Otherwise, you'll die, since the Lord's anointing oil remains on you." So they followed Moses' instructions. 
03Lv 10:8 Then the Lord spoke to Aaron£º 
03Lv 10:9 "You and your sons with you are not to drink wine - that is, any intoxicating drink - when you enter the tent of meeting. That way, you won't die. This is to be a perpetual statute throughout your generations.
03Lv 10:10 "Differentiate between what's sacred and common and between what's unclean and clean. 
03Lv 10:11 Teach the Israelites all the statutes that the Lord had commanded you by the authority of Moses." 
03Lv 10:12 Then Moses spoke to Aaron and his sons Eleazar and Ithamar£º "Take the leftovers from the grain offering and the offerings made by fire and eat the unleavened bread beside the altar, because it is most holy to the Lord. 
03Lv 10:13 Eat at a sacred place, because it's your and your son's prescribed portions. It's from the offering made by fire to the Lord, since I've commanded it. 
03Lv 10:14 As to the breast and thigh raised offerings, you and your sons and daughters with you may eat them at a clean place, because it belongs to you and is your sons' prescribed portions. They were taken from the sacrifices of peace offering of the Israelites. 
03Lv 10:15 They are to bring the thigh offering and the breast raised offering with the offerings made by fire from the fat to wave as a raised offering in the Lord's presence. It will be a perpetual portion for you and your sons with you, just as the Lord had commanded."
03Lv 10:16 Now, Moses diligently sought for the goat that had been offered as a sin offering, but it had already been incinerated, so he was angry with Aaron's sons who remained. He asked Elaezar and Ithamar, 
03Lv 10:17 "Why didn't you eat the sin offering at the sacred place -  It's most holy and he has given it to you so that you may bear the punishment for the iniquity of the entire congregation and make atonement for them in the Lord's presence. 
03Lv 10:18 Look! Its blood wasn't brought inside the sanctuary. You are to have eaten it in the sanctuary, just as I've commanded."
03Lv 10:19 But Aaron replied to Moses, "Today they've offered their sin and whole burnt offerings in the Lord's presence. Yet things such as these have happened to me. Had I eaten the sin offering today, would that be pleasing in the Lord's opinion?"
03Lv 10:20 When Moses heard that explanation, he was pleased.
03Lv 11:1 The Lord spoke to Moses and Aaron£º 
03Lv 11:2 "Tell the Israelites, 'These are the living creatures that you may eat among the animals of the earth. 
03Lv 11:3 You may eat any animal that has divided hooves with cloven feet and that ruminates its cud, 
03Lv 11:4 except you are not to eat the following animals that have divided hooves or ruminate their cud£º the camel (because it chews the cud but doesn't have divided hooves) is to be unclean for you; 
03Lv 11:5 the rock badger (because it chews its cud but its hooves aren't divided) is to be unclean for you; 
03Lv 11:6 the hare (because it chews its cud, but its hooves aren't divided) is to be unclean for you; 
03Lv 11:7 the pig (because it has divided hooves and is therefore cloven footed, but it doesn't ruminate its cud), is to be unclean for you. 
03Lv 11:8 You are not to eat its flesh or even touch their carcasses. They are to be unclean for you.'"2
03Lv 11:9 "You may eat anything that's in the waters; that is, you may eat anything that has fins and scales either from the seas or from the rivers. 
03Lv 11:10 But anything that doesn't have fins or scales - whether from the seas or the rivers - any of the swarming creatures and living creatures in the waters are detestable for you. 
03Lv 11:11 They are to be detestable for you. You are not to eat of their meat and you are to detest their carcasses. 
03Lv 11:12 Anything that doesn't have fins or scales in the waters is a detestable thing for you."
03Lv 11:13 "These are detestable things for you among winged creatures that you are not to eat, because they are detestable for you£º the eagle, vulture, osprey, 
03Lv 11:14  red kite, falcon of any kind, 
03Lv 11:15 every kind of raven, 
03Lv 11:16 ostrich, nighthawk, sea gull, hawk of every kind, 
03Lv 11:17 owl, cormorant, ibis, 
03Lv 11:18 water-hen, pelican, carrion, 
03Lv 11:19 stork, heron of every kind, hoopoe, bat, 
03Lv 11:20 and any winged insect that crawls on four legs is detestable for you. 
03Lv 11:21 "However, you may eat winged creatures that crawl on four legs that extend over its head and by which it hops on the ground. 
03Lv 11:22 These creatures that you may eat include the locust of any kind, the bald locust of any kind, the cricket of any kind, and the grasshopper of any kind. 
03Lv 11:23 But any other winged insect that has four legs is detestable for you 
03Lv 11:24 and are unclean. Anyone who touches their carcasses becomes unclean until evening. 
03Lv 11:25 And anyone who carries their carcasses is to wash his clothes, since he will remain unclean until evening."
03Lv 11:26 "Any animal that has divided hooves and is cloven-footed but doesn't chew the cud is unclean for you. Anyone who touches them is unclean. 
03Lv 11:27 Among the animals, anything that walks on their paws and if on four legs is unclean for you. Anyone who touches their carcasses becomes unclean until evening. 
03Lv 11:28 Whoever carries their carcass is to wash their clothes, because they've become unclean until evening. They're unclean for you.
03Lv 11:29 "These are unclean for you among the swarming creatures that crawl over the land£º the rat, mouse, lizards of every kind, 
03Lv 11:30 the gecko, crocodile, lizard, sand lizard, and chameleon. 
03Lv 11:31 These are unclean for you among the swarming creatures, so anyone who touches them when they're dead becomes unclean until evening.
03Lv 11:32 "Furthermore, anything on which they fall upon when they're dead becomes unclean, whether on an article of wood, clothing, skin, or a sack. And any vessel used for any work is to be washed in water, because it has become unclean until evening. 
03Lv 11:33 Any earthen vessel in which any of these things fall becomes unclean, along with everything in it. You are to destroy it, along with all its contents."
03Lv 11:34 "Any food that may be eaten, but which water has soaked in, becomes unclean. Any drink, which may be drunk in any of these vessels becomes unclean. 
03Lv 11:35 And anything in which their carcass falls on becomes unclean. An oven or stove is to be broken in pieces. They're unclean and therefore unclean for you.
03Lv 11:36 "A spring or a cistern that holds water is clean, but whoever touches the carcass of an unclean animal will be unclean. 
03Lv 11:37 If their carcass falls on a seed, which is for sowing, what is to be sown is clean. 
03Lv 11:38 But if water is put on the seed and part of their carcass falls on it, then it has become unclean for you. 
03Lv 11:39 "If any of the animals that you may eat dies, the one who touches its carcass becomes unclean until evening. 
03Lv 11:40 The one who eats from its carcass is to wash his clothes, because he has become unclean until evening. Even the one who carries the carcass is to wash his clothes, because he has become unclean until evening."
03Lv 11:41 "Every swarming thing that swarms the land is detestable for you. It is not to be eaten. 
03Lv 11:42 You are not to eat anything that crawls on its belly, anything that walks on four legs, anything that has many legs, and all the swarming creatures that swarm the land, because they're detestable.
03Lv 11:43 "You are not to make yourselves detestable on account of any swarming creature that swarms the land. And you are not to defile yourselves and become unclean because of them, 
03Lv 11:44 because I, the Lord, am your God. "Set yourselves apart and be holy, because I am holy. You are not to defile yourselves with any of the swarming creatures that swarm the earth.
03Lv 11:45 "I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. Be holy, because I am holy. 
03Lv 11:46 This is the law concerning animals, every living creature that moves on the waters or swarms on land.
03Lv 11:47 You are to differentiate between the clean and unclean, between the living creature that can be eaten and the living creature that is not to be eaten.1146
03Lv 12:1 The Lord spoke to Moses, 
03Lv 12:2 "Tell the Israelites that a woman who conceives and bears a son is unclean for seven days. Just like the days of her menstruation, she is unclean.

03Lv 17:10 "If anyone from the house of Israel or a resident alien who lives among them eats any form of blood, I'll oppose that person who ate the blood and eliminate him from his people, 
03Lv 17:11 because the life of the flesh is in the blood itself, and I myself have given it to you all so that atonement may be made for your souls on the altar, since the blood itself makes atonement through the life that is in it. 
03Lv 17:12 This is why I've said to the Israelites that no person among you is to eat blood. Even the resident alien who lives among you is not to eat blood.
03Lv 17:13 "If a person from the house of Israel or a resident alien who lives among you has hunted live game or a bird that may be eaten, he is to extract its blood and cover it with soil,

03Lv 23:6 "On the fifteenth day of that month is the Feast of Unleavened Bread to the Lord. For seven days you are to eat unleavened bread. 
03Lv 23:7 On the first day that you hold the sacred assembly you are to do no servile work. 
03Lv 23:8 Instead, you are to bring an offering made by fire to the Lord daily for seven days. On the seventh day you are also to hold a sacred assembly during which you are to do no servile work."
03Lv 23:9 The Lord spoke to Moses, 
03Lv 23:10 "Tell the Israelites that when you enter the land that I'm about to give you and gather its produce, you are to bring a sheaf from the first portion of your harvest to the priest, 
03Lv 23:11 who will offer the sheaf in the Lord's presence for your acceptance. The priest is to wave it on the day after the Sabbath.
03Lv 23:12 "On the day you wave the sheaf, you are to offer a one year old male lamb without defect for a burnt offering in the Lord's presence. 
03Lv 23:13 Also present a meal offering of two tenths of a measure of fine flour mixed with olive oil as an offering made by fire to the Lord, a pleasing aroma. "Now as to a drink offering, you are to present a fourth of a hin of wine. 
03Lv 23:14 You are not to eat bread, parched grain, or fresh grain until that day when you've brought the offering of your God. This is to be an eternal ordinance throughout your generations, wherever you live."
03Lv 23:15 "Starting the day after the Sabbath, count for yourselves seven weeks from the day you brought the sheaf of wave offering. They are to be complete. 
03Lv 23:16 Count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath, then bring a new meal offering to the Lord.
03Lv 23:17 "Bring two loaves of bread from home as wave offerings made from two tenths of fine flour, baked with leaven, as first fruits to the Lord.
03Lv 23:18 "Along with the loaves of bread, bring seven lambs, a year old without defect, one young bull as an offering, and two rams as offering to the Lord, along with your gift and drink offerings, and present them as an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
03Lv 23:19 "Prepare one male goat for a sin offering and two one year old rams for peace offerings. 
03Lv 23:20 Then the priest is to wave them - the two lambs with the bread of first fruits - as raised offering in the Lord's presence. They'll be sacred to the Lord on account of the priest.
03Lv 23:21 "On the same day proclaim a sacred assembly for yourselves. You are not to do any servile work - and this is to be an eternal ordinance wherever you live throughout your generations. 
03Lv 23:22 Furthermore, when you harvest the produce of your land, you are not to harvest all the way to the corners of your field or gather the gleanings of your harvest. Leave them for the poor and resident alien. I am the Lord your God.
03Lv 23:23 The Lord spoke to Moses, 
03Lv 23:24 Tell the Israelites that on the first day of the seventh month you are to have a Sabbath of rest for you, a memorial announced by a loud blast of trumpets. It is to be a sacred assembly. 
03Lv 23:25 You are not to do any servile work. Instead bring an offering made by fire to the Lord. 
03Lv 23:26 The Lord spoke to Moses, 
03Lv 23:27 "However, on the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement. It's a sacred assembly for you. Humble yourselves and bring an offering made by fire to the Lord.
03Lv 23:28 "You are not to do any work that same day. It's the Day of Atonement, because your atonement is made in the presence of the Lord your God. 
03Lv 23:29 Anyone who doesn't humble himself that same day is to be eliminated from contact with his people. 
03Lv 23:30 I'll eliminate anyone who does work that day from among his people.
03Lv 23:31 You are not to do any work. This is to be an eternal ordinance throughout your generations wherever you live. 
03Lv 23:32 It's a Sabbath of rest for you, on which you are to humble yourselves starting the evening of the ninth day of the month. You are to observe your Sabbath from evening to evening."
03Lv 23:33 The Lord spoke to Moses, 
03Lv 23:34 Tell the Israelites that starting the fifteenth day of this seventh month is the week-long Feast of Tabernacles to the Lord. 
03Lv 23:35 On the first day you are to hold a sacred assembly when you are not to do any servile work. 
03Lv 23:36 For seven days, bring offerings made by fire to the Lord. "The eighth day is also to be a sacred assembly for you. Bring offerings made by fire to the Lord. It's a sacred assembly. You are not to do any servile work.
03Lv 23:37 "These are the Lord's appointed feasts that you are to proclaim as sacred assemblies. Bring offerings made by fire to the Lord - a whole burnt offering, a meal offering, a sacrifice, and drink offerings. Do this every day on its assigned date 
03Lv 23:38 in addition to the Lord's Sabbath, regarding your gifts, and your offerings in fulfillment of vows, and your freely given offerings that you will bring to the Lord.23
03Lv 23:39 "On the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when you've harvested the produce of the land, you are to observe the feast of the Lord for seven days. The first day is  to be a Sabbath rest, and the eighth day also is to be a Sabbath rest.
03Lv 23:40 "On the first day, take branches from impressive fruit trees, branches from palm-trees, boughs from thick trees, and poplars from the brooks. Then you are to rejoice in the presence of the Lord your God for seven days. 
03Lv 23:41 Observe it as a pilgrimage feast in the presence of the Lord for seven days in the year. This is to be an eternal ordinance throughout your generations. Observe the feast during the seventh month. 
03Lv 23:42 You are to live in booths for seven days. Every native born of Israel is to live in booths 
03Lv 23:43 in order for your future generations to know that the Israelites lived in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am the Lord your God."
03Lv 23:44 This is what Moses spoke about to the Israelites regarding the Lord's appointed feasts.
03Lv 24:1 The Lord spoke to Moses, 
03Lv 24:2 "Tell the Israelites that they are to bring to you pure oil made from beaten olives in order to keep the lamp burning continuously. 
03Lv 24:3 Outside the canopy of the testimony in the tent of meeting, Aaron is to arrange it continuously in the Lord's presence from evening until morning as an eternal ordinance throughout your generations. 
03Lv 24:4 He is to arrange the lamps so that they burn continuously on a ceremonially pure lampstand in the Lord's presence. 
03Lv 24:5 "Take fine flour and bake twelve cakes using two tenths of a measure of for each cake. 
03Lv 24:6 Arrange them in two rows, six on each row on a ceremonially pure table in the Lord's presence. 
03Lv 24:7 Put pure frankincense on each row for a memorial offering. It will serve as an offering made by fire to the Lord. 
03Lv 24:8 Every Sabbath day they are to be arranged in the Lord's presence, as a gift from the Israelites, an eternal covenant. 
03Lv 24:9 This gift will belong to Aaron and his sons, and they are to eat it in a sacred place, because it's the most holy thing for him of all the offerings made by fire to the Lord. This is to be an eternal ordinance. 
03Lv 24:10 Now a son of an Israelite woman and an Egyptian man went out among the Israelites. The Israelite woman's son got into a fight with an Israelite man in the camp. 
03Lv 24:11 Then the Israelite woman's son blasphemed the Name and cursed, so they brought him to Moses. His mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, from the clan of Dan. 
03Lv 24:12 They placed him in custody until a decision would be made to them according to the word of the Lord. 
03Lv 24:13 The Lord then spoke to Moses, 
03Lv 24:14 "Take the one who cursed outside the camp. Everyone who had heard him is to lay their hands on his head. Then the entire congregation is to stone him to death. 
03Lv 24:15 Moreover, tell the Israelites that anyone who curses his God will bear the consequences of his own sin, because the one who blasphemes the name of the Lord is certainly to be put to death. The entire congregation is to stone him to death. 
03Lv 24:16 As it is for the resident alien so it is to be with the native born£º when he blasphemes the Name, he is to be put to death.
03Lv 24:17 "If a man beats a human being to death, he is certainly to be executed, 
03Lv 24:18 but whoever beats an animal to death is to replace it, life for life.
03Lv 24:19 "If a man disfigures his fellow, whatever he did is to be done to him also. 
03Lv 24:20 Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, just as he had caused a disfigurement against another man, so it is to be done against him.
03Lv 24:21 "Whoever beats an animal to death is to replace it, but whoever who beats a human being to death is to be put to death.
03Lv 24:22 You are to have for yourselves consistent procedures in deciding a case. As it is for the resident alien, so it is for the native born. I am the Lord your God."
03Lv 24:23 So Moses spoke to the Israelites and they brought the one who cursed outside the camp and stoned him to death with boulders. The Israelites did just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
03Lv 25:1 The Lord spoke to Moses on Mount Sinai. 
03Lv 25:2 "Tell the Israelites that when you enter the land that I'm about to give you, you are to let the land observe a Sabbath to the Lord. 
03Lv 25:3 For six years you may plant your fields, and for six years you may prune your vineyard and gather its produce.
03Lv 25:4 "But the seventh year is to be a Sabbath of rest for the land - a Sabbath for the Lord. You are not to plant your field or prune your vineyard. 
03Lv 25:5 You are not to gather what grows from the spilled kernels of your crops. You are not to pick the grapes of your untrimmed vines. Let it be a year of Sabbath for the land. 
03Lv 25:6 You may take the Sabbath produce of the land for your food - you, your male and maid servants, your hired laborers, and the resident alien with you. 
03Lv 25:7 The cattle and the wild animals in your land - everything it produces - are for your food.4
03Lv 25:8 "Count for yourselves seven years of Sabbaths, seven times seven years. This set of seven weeks of years total forty nine years for you. 
03Lv 25:9 Sound a horn on the tenth day of the seventh month of this fiftieth year. Likewise on the Day of Atonement sound the horn throughout your land.
03Lv 25:10 "Set aside and consecrate the fiftieth year to declare liberty throughout the land for all of its inhabitants. It is to be a jubilee for you. Every person is to return to his own land that he has inherited. "Likewise, every person is to return to his clan. 
03Lv 25:11 The fiftieth year is to be a year of jubilee for you. You are not to sow or harvest the spilled kernels that grow of itself or pick grapes from the untrimmed vines 
03Lv 25:12 because it's jubilee. It's sacred for you. But you may eat its produce from the field.
03Lv 25:13 "During this year of jubilee, each person is to return to his own land that he has inherited. 
03Lv 25:14 So if you had sold property to a neighbor or had acquired land from your neighbor, you are not to cheat one another. 
03Lv 25:15 According to the number of years after the jubilee, you may buy from your neighbor. And according to the number of years with crops, he may sell to you. 
03Lv 25:16 If the number of years are more, increase the selling price. If the years be few, decrease its selling price, because he's selling to you according to the volume of produce. 
03Lv 25:17 No one is to cheat his neighbor. Instead, you are to fear your God, because I'm the Lord your God.
03Lv 25:18 "Observe my statutes and keep my ordinances. Do them so that you may live securely in the land. 
03Lv 25:19 Then the land will yield its fruit and you'll eat to your satisfaction and live securely.
03Lv 25:20 "Now if you ask, 'What will we eat during the seventh year -  After all, we may not plant or even gather our produce!' 
03Lv 25:21 I'll command my blessing on you during the sixth year so that it will yield produce for three years! 
03Lv 25:22 That way, you are to sow in the eighth year, eating the produce from the old harvest. Until the ninth year when its produce comes in, you'll eat from the old harvest."
03Lv 25:23 "The land is not to be sold with any finality, because the land belongs to me. You're sojourners and travelers with me. 
03Lv 25:24 So throughout all of your land inheritance, grant the right of redemption for the land. 
03Lv 25:25 "If your brother is poor so that he had to a sell portion of his inheritance, then his nearest kinsman redeemer is to come and redeem what his brother has sold. 
03Lv 25:26 If a person doesn't have a kinsman redeemer but has become rich and found sufficient means for his redemption, 
03Lv 25:27 then let him account for the years for which it was sold, return the excess to the person to whom it was sold, and then return to his property. 
03Lv 25:28 If he's not able to redeem it back for himself, then what he sold is to remain in the hand of the buyer until the year of jubilee. In the jubilee, it is to be returned so he may return to his property. 
03Lv 25:29 "If a person sells a residential house in a walled city, then he is to redeem it within the year in which it was sold. He may have right to its redemption for a full year. 
03Lv 25:30 But if it's not redeemed by the end of a full year, then the house next to which is a wall is to belong to the one who bought it, in perpetuity throughout his generations. It is not to be returned in the jubilee.
03Lv 25:31 "However, the houses in the villages that don't have walls around them are to be categorized along with the fields of the land. It may be redeemed, so it is to be returned in the jubilee.
03Lv 25:32 "Nevertheless, the cities that belong to the Levites - that is, the houses in the cities that belong to them - are to belong to the Levites perpetually as part of their right of redemption. 
03Lv 25:33 If someone from the Levites redeems the houses in the cities that they own, they are to be returned in the jubilee, because the houses of the cities of the Levites are to remain their property among the Israelites. 
03Lv 25:34 Also, the open land of their cities is not to be sold, because it is to remain their perpetual inheritance."
03Lv 25:35 If your relative becomes poor so that he is indebted to you, then you are to support him. You are to let him live with you just like the resident alien and the traveler. 
03Lv 25:36 You are not to take interest or profit from him. Instead, you are to fear your God and let your relative live with you.
03Lv 25:37 "You are not to loan him money with interest or sell him your food at a profit. 
03Lv 25:38 I'm the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your God. 
03Lv 25:39 "If your brother with you becomes poor, so that he sells himself to you, you are not to make him serve like a bond slave. 
03Lv 25:40 Instead, he is to serve with you like a hired servant or traveler who lives with you until the year of jubilee. 
03Lv 25:41 Then he and his children with him may leave to return to his family and his ancestor's inheritance. 
03Lv 25:42 Since they're my servants whom I've brought out from the land of Egypt, they are not to be sold as slaves. 
03Lv 25:43 You are not to rule over them with harshness. You are to fear your God." 39
03Lv 25:44 "As for your male and maid slaves who will be with you, you may buy male and female slaves from among the nations. 
03Lv 25:45 You may also buy from resident aliens who live among you and their families who are with you, whom they fathered in your land. They may become your property.
03Lv 25:46 "You may give them as inherited property to your children after you, to own as properties in perpetuity. You may make bond slaves of them, but no one is to rule over his fellow Israelite with harshness.
03Lv 25:47 "If a resident alien or traveler becomes rich, but your relative who lives next to him is so poor that he sells himself to that resident alien or traveler among you or to a member of the resident alien's family, 
03Lv 25:48 he has the right to be redeemed after he sells himself. One of his brothers may redeem him. 
03Lv 25:49 His uncle or his uncle's son may redeem him or any blood relative from his clan may redeem him. If he becomes rich, then he may redeem himself.
03Lv 25:50 "He is to bring an accounting to the one who bought him, starting from the year he had sold himself until the year of jubilee. The price of his sale is to correspond to the number of years comparable to the time a hired servant stays with him.
03Lv 25:51 "If there are still many years left, he is to refund the cost of his redemption. 
03Lv 25:52 But if only a few years are left until the year of jubilee, he is to bring an accounting of the years that he is to refund for his redemption. 
03Lv 25:53 Like a hired servant, he is to remain with him year after year, but he is not to rule over him with what you see as severity.
03Lv 25:54 "If he isn't redeemed by these, then he is to be set free in the year of jubilee - he and his children with him 
03Lv 25:55 because the Israelites are my servants. They're my servants, since I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I'm the Lord your God."
03Lv 26:1 "You are not to make worthless idols, images, or pillars for yourselves, nor set up for yourselves carved images to bow down to them in the land, because I'm the Lord your God.
03Lv 26:2 "You are to keep my Sabbath and fear my sanctuary. I'm the Lord.
03Lv 26:3 "If you live by my statutes, obey my commands, and observe them, 
03Lv 26:4 then I'll send your rain in its season so that the land will yield its produce and the trees of the field will yield their fruit. 
03Lv 26:5 Threshing will extend to the time of vintage and the vintage will extend to the time of sowing so that you'll eat your bread to your satisfaction and live securely in your land.
03Lv 26:6 "I'll give peace in the land so that you'll lie down without fear. I'll remove wild beasts from the land, not even war will come to your land. 
03Lv 26:7 Instead you'll pursue your enemies and they'll die by the sword before you. 
03Lv 26:8 Five of you will chase a hundred, a hundred of you will chase ten thousand, and your enemies will fall by the sword before you.
03Lv 26:9 "I'll look after you, ensuring that you'll be fruitful. I'll increase your number and keep my covenant with you. 
03Lv 26:10 When you have consumed what was stored of the old, then you'll take out the old and replace it with what's new.
03Lv 26:11 "I'll set up my tabernacle in your midst and I won't loathe you. 
03Lv 26:12 I'll walk among you. I will be your God, and you'll be my people. 
03Lv 26:13 I'm the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that you will no longer be their slaves, since I've broken their oppressive yoke upon you to make you walk upright."
03Lv 26:14 "But if you won't listen to me and obey all these commands, 
03Lv 26:15 and if you refuse my statutes, loathe my ordinances, fail to do all my commands, thereby breaching my covenant, 
03Lv 26:16 then I will certainly do this to you£º I'll appoint sudden terror to infect you like tuberculosis and fever. Your the eyes will fail and your life will waste away. You'll plant in vain, because your enemies will consume what you plant.
03Lv 26:17 "I'll set my face against you so that you'll be defeated before your enemies. Those who hate you will have dominion over you and you'll keep fleeing even when no one is pursuing you.
03Lv 26:18 "If despite all of this you still don't listen to me, then I'll punish you seven times more on account of your sins. 
03Lv 26:19 I'll break your mighty pride. I'll make the heavens to be like iron and the ground like bronze. 
03Lv 26:20 Your strength will be spent in vain, because your land won't yield its produce and the trees of the land won't yield its fruit.
03Lv 26:21 "If you live life contrary to me and remain unwilling to listen to me, then I'll add to your wounds seven times more on account of your sins. 
03Lv 26:22 I'll send the wild beasts against you from the open country to deprive you of your children, destroy your cattle, and decrease your number so that your roads become desolate. 
03Lv 26:23 If despite these things you will don't return to me, but live life contrary to me, 
03Lv 26:24 then I'll certainly oppose you. I'll take vengeance against you seven fold on account of your sins. 
03Lv 26:25 I'll bring the sword against you to execute the vengeance of my covenant. When you gather in your cities, I'll send a pestilence. As a result, you'll be delivered into the control of your enemies.
03Lv 26:26 "When I destroy the source of your bread, ten women will bake bread in one oven. Then they'll return back your bread by weight. You'll eat but won't be satisfied. 
03Lv 26:27 "If after all of this time you don't listen to me, but instead live life contrary to me, 
03Lv 26:28 I'll oppose you with vicious rage. Indeed, I myself will punish you seven fold on account of your sins. 
03Lv 26:29 At that time you'll eat the flesh of your sons and you'll eat the flesh of your daughters.
03Lv 26:30 "I'll destroy your high places and cut down your sun-pillars. Then I'll cast your dead bodies on top of the bodies of your idols. "I'll loathe you. 
03Lv 26:31 I'll lay your cities to waste and destroy your sanctuaries so I don't have to smell the scent of your soothing odors.
03Lv 26:32 "I'll make the land so desolate that your enemies who live in it will be astonished."
03Lv 26:33 "I'll scatter you among the nations and draw the sword after you so that your land becomes desolate and your towns become ruins.
03Lv 26:34 "Then the land will finally be pleased with its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate while you are in the land of your enemies. At that time the land will rest and take its Sabbaths. 
03Lv 26:35 As long as it lies desolate, it will have rest, that it will not have had during your Sabbaths when you were living in it.
03Lv 26:36 "As for the remnants among you, I'll bring despair in their hearts in the land of their enemies so that even the sound of a blown leaf will chase them and they flee as though pursued by the sword and fall when no one is pursuing. 
03Lv 26:37 They'll stumble over each other as though fleeing before the sword, even though no one is pursuing. "You won't have power to resist your enemies. 
03Lv 26:38 You'll perish among the nations and the land of your enemies will consume you. 
03Lv 26:39 The remnants among you will waste away on account of their iniquity in the land of your enemies. Indeed, they'll also waste away on account of the iniquities of their ancestors with them.
03Lv 26:40 "Nevertheless, when they confess their iniquity, the iniquity of their ancestors, and their unfaithfulness by which they acted unfaithfully against me by living life contrary to me, 
03Lv 26:41 causing me to oppose them and take them to the land of their enemies so that the uncircumcised foreskin of their hearts can be humbled and so that they accept the punishment of their iniquity, 
03Lv 26:42 then I'll remember my covenant with Jacob, my covenant with Isaac, and my covenant with Abraham. I'll also remember the land.
03Lv 26:43 "They will leave the land so it can rest while it lies desolate without them. That's when they'll receive the punishment of their iniquity because indeed they will have rejected my ordinances and despised my statutes.
03Lv 26:44 "Yet despite all of these things, when they're in the land of their enemies, I won't reject or despise them so as to completely destroy them and by doing so violate my covenant with them, because I'm the Lord their God. 
03Lv 26:45 Instead, on account of them, I'll remember my covenant with their ancestors when I brought them out from the land of Egypt right before the eyes of the nations, so that I could be their God. I'm the Lord."
03Lv 26:46 These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws that the Lord made between himself and the Israelites on Mount Sinai, as recorded by the hand of Moses.
03Lv 27:1 The Lord spoke to Moses, 
03Lv 27:2 "Tell the Israelites that when a person makes a special vow based on the appropriate value of people who belong to the Lord, 
03Lv 27:3 if your valuation of the vow is for a male from 20 to 60 sixty years old, the valuation is to be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary.
03Lv 27:4 "If she is a female from 20 to 60 years old, then your valuation is to be 30 shekels according to the shekel of the sanctuary.

03Lv 27:7 "If a person is 60 or more years old, then your valuation for a male is to be fifteen shekels and for a female ten shekels.
03Lv 27:8 "But if he be too poor to be valuated, then cause him to stand before the priest and let the priest set a value on him according to the ability of the one making the vow.
03Lv 27:9 "If it's an animal from which they make an offering to the Lord, everything that he gives to the Lord from it will be holy. 
03Lv 27:10 He is not to substitute it or exchange it - the good with the bad or the bad with the good. "If he ever makes an exchange of an animal for an animal, then it and what's being exchanged is holy.
03Lv 27:11 "If any animal is unclean, which cannot be brought to the Lord as an offering, make the animal stand in the presence of the priest, 
03Lv 27:12 then the priest will evaluate it as to whether it is good or bad. According to your - that is, the priest's - valuation, so it is to be. 
03Lv 27:13 If a kinsman redeemer decides to redeem it, then he is to add a fifth to your valuation."
03Lv 27:14 "If a person consecrates his house to be holy to the Lord, then the priest is to set a value for it as to its worth, whether good or bad. As the priest sets value on it, so it will stand.
03Lv 27:15 "And if he that consecrated it wishes to redeem his house, he is to add one fifth to your valuation, after which it is to belong to him.
03Lv 27:16 "If a person consecrates a portion of the field from his inheritance to the Lord, then your valuation is to be based on its capacity for yielding a harvest. Each homer of barley is to be valued at 50 shekels of silver.
03Lv 27:17 "If he consecrates his field in the year of jubilee, it is to be based on your valuation.
03Lv 27:18 "If he consecrates his field after the jubilee, then the priest is to account to him the silver according to the years that remain until the year of jubilee, with a deduction corresponding to your valuation.
03Lv 27:19 "If the one who consecrated the field intends to redeem it, then he is to add one fifth of your valuation to it in silver, then it is to be established as his.
03Lv 27:20 "But if he won't redeem the field, but instead sells it to another person. then it is not to be redeemed anymore. 
03Lv 27:21 When the field is released in the jubilee, it will be holy to the Lord. As a field that's devoted, it is to belong to the priest as his inheritance.
03Lv 27:22 "If he consecrates a field that he had bought and that isn't part of his inheritance, 
03Lv 27:23 then the priest is to account to him the evaluated worth until the year of jubilee. Then he is to give the amount of valuation on that day as a holy gift to the Lord.
03Lv 27:24 "During the year of jubilee, the field is to be returned by the one who originally sold it, that is, to the owner of the land. 
03Lv 27:25 Every valuation is to be according to the shekel of the sanctuary, evaluated at 20 gerahs to the shekel. 
03Lv 27:26 "No person is to consecrate the first born, because the first born of the animals already belongs to the Lord. Whether ox or goat, it belongs to the Lord. 
03Lv 27:27 If it's an unclean animal, then he is to ransom it according to your valuation, adding a fifth to it. If it's not redeemed then it is to be sold according to your valuation.
03Lv 27:28 "However, any devoted thing, that a person consecrates to the Lord from what he owns, whether man, animals, or inherited fields, is not to be sold or redeemed. Any devoted thing is most sacred. It belongs to the Lord. 
03Lv 27:29 But anyone who is completely devoted from among human beings is not to be ransomed. He is certainly to be put to death.
03Lv 27:30 "Any tithes of the land from grain grown on the land or from fruit grown on the trees belong to the Lord. It's sacred to the Lord. 
03Lv 27:31 But if a person wishes to redeem his tithe, he is to add a fifth to it.
03Lv 27:32 "All the tithes from cattle and flocks that pass under the measuring rod are sacred to the Lord. 
03Lv 27:33 He is not to examine it to see if it's good or bad or even exchange it. If he does exchange it, what has been exchanged as well as its substitute is sacred. It is not to be redeemed."
03Lv 27:34 These are the commands, that the Lord commanded Moses to deliver to the Israelites on Mount Sinai.
04Nm 1:1 In the Sinai desert, the Lord spoke to Moses inside the Tent of Meeting on the first day of the second month of the second year after they had left the land of Egypt. He said, 
04Nm 1:2 "Take a census of the entire Israelite community, numbering them by their tribes and by ancestral houses. List the names of every male one-by-one,

04Nm 1:46 The total of all those who were numbered was 603,550.
04Nm 1:47 The Levites were not counted according to their ancestral houses 
04Nm 1:48 because the Lord had ordered Moses£º 
04Nm 1:49 "Be sure not to number or count the tribe of Levi with the rest of the Israelites. 
04Nm 1:50 Instead, appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of the testimony, all the vessels, and everything in it. They are to carry the tabernacle and all the vessels in it. They are to attend to it and camp around it. 
04Nm 1:51 Whenever the tabernacle is ready for travel, the Levites are to take it down. "When it's time to encamp, the Levites are to set it up. Any unauthorized person who approaches it is to be executed. 
04Nm 1:52 Then the Israelites are to encamp around the tabernacle, arranged according to their company and the standard of their army. 
04Nm 1:53 But the Levites are to encamp on all sides of the tabernacle of the testimony so that divine wrath won't fall on the congregation of Israel. The Levites are to take care of the tabernacle of the testimony."1
04Nm 1:54 The Israelites observed everything that the Lord had commanded Moses, doing exactly what they were told. 
04Nm 2:1 Later, the Lord told Moses and Aaron, 
04Nm 2:2 "Every single Israelite is to encamp beneath his standard with the emblem of his ancestral house. The Israelites are to encamp from a distance, but surrounding the tent of meeting."
04Nm 2:3 "The encampment of Judah is to settle east toward the sunrise under their standard. The leader of Judah is to be Amminadab's son Nahshon. 
04Nm 2:4 Those in his division number 74,600.

04Nm 2:8 Those in his division number 57,400. 
04Nm 2:9 All those numbered by division in the camp of Judah total 186,400. They are to be the first to travel."
04Nm 2:10 "Toward the south is to be the division of the camp of Reuben under their standard. The leader of Reuben is to be Shedeur's son Elizur. 
04Nm 2:11 Those in his division number 46,500.

04Nm 2:15 Those in his division number 45,650. 
04Nm 2:16 All those numbered by division in the camp of Reuben total 151,450. They are to be the second to travel."
04Nm 2:17 "Then the tent of meeting is to travel with the camp of the Levites in the middle of the camps. They are to travel just as they have camped, each as designated under his standard."
04Nm 2:18 "Toward the west is to be the division of the camp of Ephraim under their standard. The leader of Ephraim is to be Ammihud's son Elishama. 
04Nm 2:19 Those in his division number 40,500.
04Nm 2:20 "The tribe of Manasseh is to encamp beside them. The leader of Manasseh is to be Pedahzur's son Gamaliel. 
04Nm 2:21 Those in his division number 32,200.

04Nm 2:31 All those numbered by division in the camp of Dan total 157,600. They are to be the last to travel under their standards."
04Nm 2:32 Here is a summary of the census of the Israelites according to the tribes of their ancestral houses£º All the divisions in the camps numbered 603,550, 
04Nm 2:33 but the Levites were not numbered along with the other Israelites, just as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
04Nm 2:34 So the Israelites did everything just as the Lord had commanded Moses; that is, they encamped under their standard as each person traveled with his own tribe and ancestral house.
04Nm 3:1 This is a record of the genealogies of Aaron and Moses current as of the day on which the Lord addressed Moses on Mount Sinai. 
04Nm 3:2 The sons of Aaron were Nadab the first-born, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar 
04Nm 3:3 who were anointed priests and whom he consecrated as priests. 
04Nm 3:4 Nadab and Abihu died in the Lord's presence when they offered unauthorized fire before him in the Sinai wilderness. Since they didn't have their own children, Eleazar and Ithamar ministered as priest under the authority of Aaron their father.2
04Nm 3:5 The Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 3:6 "Bring the tribe of Levi near and present them to Aaron the priest so they may serve him. 
04Nm 3:7 They are to take care of his needs and the needs of the whole congregation at the tent of meeting by performing duties at the tabernacle. 
04Nm 3:8 They are to take charge of the utensils at the tent of meeting and meet the needs of the Israelites by performing duties on behalf of the tabernacle. 
04Nm 3:9 Assign the Levites to Aaron and his sons from among the Israelites. 
04Nm 3:10 Appoint Aaron and his sons so that they are to take responsibility for their priesthood. Any unauthorized person who approaches it is to be put to death."
04Nm 3:11 Later, the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 3:12 "I'm taking the Levites for myself from among the Israelites in place of every first-born who opens the womb. The Levites belong to me 
04Nm 3:13 because all the first-born belong to me. When I destroyed all the first born in the land of Egypt, I consecrated all the first-born in Israel for myself - from human beings to livestock. They belong to me, since I am the Lord."
04Nm 3:14 The Lord also told Moses in the Sinai wilderness, 
04Nm 3:15 "Number the Levites according to their ancestral houses and tribes, numbering every male from a month old and above."
04Nm 3:16 So Moses numbered them according to the instruction of the Lord, as he had been commanded. 
04Nm 3:17 These are Levi's descendant by name£º Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 
04Nm 3:18 These are names of Gerson's descendants according to their families£º Libni and Shimei. 
04Nm 3:19 These are the names of Kohath's descendants according to their families£º Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uziel. 
04Nm 3:20 Merari's descendants according to their families were Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites according to their ancestral house.19
04Nm 3:21 The families of Libni and Shimei were descendants of Gershon. As families of the Gershonitess, 
04Nm 3:22 all the males a month old and above numbered 7,500. 
04Nm 3:23 The families of the Gershonites encamped behind the tabernacle toward the west. 
04Nm 3:24 The leader of the tribe and family of Gershon was Lael's son Eliasaph. 
04Nm 3:25 The duties of the Gershonites at the tent of meeting pertained to the tabernacle, the tent covering, the curtain to the entrance of the tent of meeting, 
04Nm 3:26 the hangings at the courtyard, the curtain to the entrance of the courtyard that surrounded the tabernacle, the altar, and all of the tent cords in use.
04Nm 3:27 The families of Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel were descendants of Kohath. As families of the Kohathites, 
04Nm 3:28 all the males a month old and above numbered 8,600. They were tasked to care of the sanctuary. 
04Nm 3:29 The Kohathites encamped beside the tabernacle toward the south. 
04Nm 3:30 The leader of the tribe and family of Kohath was Uzziel's son Elizaphan. 
04Nm 3:31 Their duties pertained to the ark, the table, the lamp stand, the altars, the utensils of the sanctuary with which they ministered, and all the curtains in use. 
04Nm 3:32 The chief of all the leaders of the Levites was Aaron the priest's son Eleazar. He was assigned to oversee those who were in charge of the services of the sanctuary.
04Nm 3:33 The families of Mahli and Mushi were descendants of Merari. As families of Merari, 
04Nm 3:34 all the males a month old and above numbered 6,200. 
04Nm 3:35 The leader of the tribe and family of Merari was Abihail's son Zuriel. The Merarites encamped beside the tabernacle toward the north. 
04Nm 3:36 The duties of the caretakers from the Merarites included the boards of the tabernacle, its bars, crossbars, socket, all its utensils for their services, 
04Nm 3:37 the pillars around the courtyard, their sockets, pegs, and tent cords. 
04Nm 3:38 In front of the tabernacle and east of the tent of meeting, Moses, Aaron, and Aaron's sons encamped facing the east. They were tasked to perform the duties of the sanctuary and care for the needs of the Israelites. Any unauthorized person who approached was to be executed. 
04Nm 3:39 As the Lord had instructed, everyone counted by Moss and Aaron from the Levites, according to their tribe, all males from a month old and above numbered 22,000.
04Nm 3:40 Later the Lord instructed Moses£º "Number all the first-born males of Israel from a month old and above and list their names. 
04Nm 3:41 Separate the Levites for me - since I am the Lord - in place of all the first-born sons of Israel. Also separate the livestock of the Levites in place of all the first born of the livestock of Israel."
04Nm 3:42 So Moses numbered all the first born from the sons of Israel just as the Lord commanded him. 
04Nm 3:43 All of the first-born male according to the list of their names from a month old and above numbered 22,273.
04Nm 3:44 Then the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 3:45 "Separate the Levites in place of all the first born sons of Israel and the livestock of the Levites in place of their livestock. The Levites belong to me, since I am the Lord. 
04Nm 3:46 You are to pay a ransom of the 273 first-born sons of Israel who exceed the census number of the Levites, 
04Nm 3:47 so collect five shekels for each individual, denominated in shekels of the sanctuary, that is, the shekel that weighs 20 gerahs. 
04Nm 3:48 Then give the money meant for ransom of their excess to Aaron and his sons."
04Nm 3:49 So Moses took the ransom money to account for the difference in the total number of those redeemed by the Levites. 
04Nm 3:50 From the first born of the Israelites, Moses took money amounting to 1,365 shekels according to the shekel of the sanctuary. 
04Nm 3:51 Moses gave the ransom money to Aaron and his sons according to the Lord's instructions, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
04Nm 4:1 The Lord told Moses and Aaron, 
04Nm 4:2 "Take a census of the Kohathites from among the Levites according to their tribes and ancestral houses 
04Nm 4:3 from 30 years and older through the age of 50 years, from everyone who can enter the service to perform work at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:4 "Here's what the Kohathites are to do regarding the tent of meeting and what's inside the most holy place£º 
04Nm 4:5 When the camp is about to travel, Aaron and his sons are to come and take down the veil of the curtain and cover the ark of testimony with it. 
04Nm 4:6 They are to set a leather-dyed skin covering over it, cover it with a pure blue cloth, and then insert its poles.
04Nm 4:7 "They are to spread a blue cloth over the table of the bread of the Presence and on top of it the dishes, pans, bowls, pitchers for drink offerings, and the bread of presence are to be on it continuously. 
04Nm 4:8 They are to spread over them a scarlet cloth and a leather-dyed skin covering and then insert its poles.7
04Nm 4:9 "They are to take a blue cloth and cover the lamp stand for the light with its lamp, lamp-snuffers, censer, and all the utensils for its oil with which they minister. 
04Nm 4:10 Then they are to put them with all the other utensils on the leather-dyed skin covering and set them on the beams for transport. 
04Nm 4:11 "On the golden altar, they are to spread a blue cloth and cover it with a leather-dyed skin covering and then insert its poles. 
04Nm 4:12 Then they are to take all the utensils for service with which they minister at the sanctuary; set them on the blue cloth; cover them with the leather-dyed skin covering and then set them on the beams for transport. 
04Nm 4:13 They are to also remove the ashes on the altar and spread over it a purple cloth. 
04Nm 4:14 Then they are to put all the instruments with which they minister there - trays, forks, shovels, bowls, and all the utensils of the altar. They are to spread over it a leather-dyed skin covering and then insert its poles.
04Nm 4:15 "When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all the utensils of the sanctuary, and the camp is about to travel, then the Kohathites are to come and carry them, but they are not to touch the most sacred objects, so they won't die. These are the duties of the Kohathites at the tent of meeting."
04Nm 4:16 "Now the duty of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest is to maintain the oil for the light, the spiced incense, the daily offerings, the oil for anointing, and to carry out all the duties of the tabernacle and the sanctuary, and to maintain its utensils." 
04Nm 4:17 Then the Lord told Moses and Aaron, 
04Nm 4:18 "You are not to eliminate the tribe of the families of the Kohathites from the Levites. 
04Nm 4:19 But do this for them so that they may live and not die when they approach the most sacred objects£º Aaron and his sons are to go in and set specific responsilities for each of them to carry out. 
04Nm 4:20 But they are not to go in to see the sanctuary as it is being covered so they won't die."
04Nm 4:21 Then the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 4:22 Take a census of the Gershonites according to their ancestral house and tribes. 
04Nm 4:23 Count their number from between 30 to 50 years old, including everyone who can enter the service to perform work at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:24 "These are the responsibilities that the Gershonites are to have£º 
04Nm 4:25 They are to carry the curtain of the tabernacle, the covering of the tent of meeting, the dyed leather covering that goes over it, the curtain for the entrance to the tent of meeting, 
04Nm 4:26 the hangings for the courtyard, the curtain for the entrance to the gate of the courtyard that surrounds the tabernacle, the altar, the ropes, all the service utensils, and everything made for them. This is to be their service area. 
04Nm 4:27 "The Gershonites are carry out the instructions of Aaron and his sons. You are to assign them their responsibilities to carry out. 
04Nm 4:28 This is the work of the tribes of Gershon at the tent of meeting - their duties under the supervision of Ithamar, the son of Aaron the priest. 
04Nm 4:29 "For the Merarites, number them according to their tribes and ancestral houses 
04Nm 4:30 from 30 to 50 years old as you count them, including everyone who can enter service and perform work at the tent of meeting. 
04Nm 4:31 This is to be their area of responsibility to carry out with respect to their service at the tent of meeting£º the board of the tabernacle, its bars, its crossbars, its sockets, 
04Nm 4:32 the pillars around the courtyard, their sockets, their pegs, their ropes, and all the utensils for all their services.  "Assign the utensils by name to each person whose responsibility it will be to carry them. 
04Nm 4:33 This is the work of the tribes of the Merarites with reference to their service at the tent of meeting under the supervision of he priest's son Ithamar."
04Nm 4:34 Moses and Aaron and the congregational leaders numbered the Kohathites according to their tribes and ancestral houses 
04Nm 4:35 from 30 to 50 fifty years old; that is, everyone who entered the service to perform work at the tent of meeting. 
04Nm 4:36 The total according to their tribe numbered 2,750 
04Nm 4:37 from the tribe of the Kohathites, everyone who were to serve at the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to what the Lord had said, under the supervision of Moses.
04Nm 4:38 The tribes and the ancestral houses of the Gershonites were numbered 
04Nm 4:39 from 30 to 50 years old; that is, everyone who entered the service to perform work at the tent of meeting. 
04Nm 4:40 The total according to their tribes and ancestral house numbered 2,630 
04Nm 4:41 from the tribes of the Gershonites, everyone who were to serve at the tent of meeting, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to what the Lord had said. 
04Nm 4:42 The tribes and ancestral house of Merari were numbered 
04Nm 4:43 from 30 to 50 years old; that is, everyone who entered the service to perform work at the tent of meeting.
04Nm 4:44  The total according to their tribes numbered 3,200 
04Nm 4:45 from the tribes of the Merarites, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to what the Lord had said, under the supervision of Moses. 
04Nm 4:46 The total of those who were numbered from the Levites by Moses and Aaron; that is, from the leaders of Israel counted according to their tribes and ancestral houses 
04Nm 4:47 from 30 to 50 years old, who entered the service for work at the tent of meeting 
04Nm 4:48 was 8,580. 
04Nm 4:49 They were numbered under the supervision of Moses ccording to what the Lord had said. Each person was assigned a responsibility to carry out, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.4
04Nm 5:1 The Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 5:2 "Command the Israelites to send outside the encampment every leper, everyone who has a discharge, and whoever is ritually defiled by contact with a corpse. 
04Nm 5:3 Whether male or female, send them outside the camp so that they won't defile their camp, because I live among them." 
04Nm 5:4 So the Israelites sent them outside the camp. The Israelites did just what the Lord had told Moses.2
04Nm 5:5 The Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 5:6 "Instruct the Israelites that whenever a man or woman does something contained in the list of the sins of man, thereby acting treacherously against the Lord, then that person stands guilty. 
04Nm 5:7 He is to confess the sin that he had committed, pay its full compensation, add one fifth to it, and give the compensation to whomever he offended. 
04Nm 5:8 But if the person has no related redeemer to whom compensation may be made, the payment is to be brought to the Lord and given to the priest, in addition to a ram for atonement with which he is to be atoned. 
04Nm 5:9 Every offering from all the most sacred things of the Israelites that they bring to the priest is to belong to him. 
04Nm 5:10 Furthermore, everyone's sacred things belong to him, and as well as regarding whatever a person gives to the priest.
04Nm 5:11 Then the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 5:12 "Instruct the Israelites what to do if a man's wife turns astray so that she unfaithfully acts against him, 
04Nm 5:13 a man has sexual relations with her and she conceals it from her husband, keeping it secret although she has defiled herself with there being no witnesses against her, but she was caught anyway. 
04Nm 5:14 If an attitude of jealousy overcomes him so that he becomes jealous at his wife when she is defiled, or if an attitude of jealousy overcomes him and he becomes jealous of his wife eventhough she isn't defiled, 
04Nm 5:15 then that man is to bring his wife to the priest along with an offering for her consisting of a tenth of an ephah of barley flour. "He is not to pour oil or set frankincense over it, because it's to be a jealousy offering, a memorial offering that will serve as a reminder of iniquity. 
04Nm 5:16 Then the priest is to bring it and make her stand in the Lord's presence. 
04Nm 5:17 The priest is to put some holy water into an earthen vessel, take some dust from the floor of the tabernacle, and put it into the water.
04Nm 5:18 "The priest is to have the woman stand in the Lord's presence, uncover her head, and put the grain offering as a memorial, a reminder of jealousy, into her hands. The priest is also to have in his hand the contaminated water that carry a curse.
04Nm 5:19 "The priest is to administer this oath to the woman£º 'If indeed another man didn't have sexual relations with you and you didn't become unfaithful to your husband, then may you be free from these waters that bring a curse. 
04Nm 5:20 But if you have become unfaithful to your husband and have become defiled because a man who isn't your husband has had sexual relations with you¡¦' 
04Nm 5:21 then the priest is to have the woman commit to an oath by saying to the woman, 'May the Lord make you a curse and a curse among your people. When the Lord makes your thigh waste away and your abdomen swell 
04Nm 5:22 and this water that brings a curse enters your abdomen, making it swell and your thigh waste away.' "Then the woman is to say 'Amen.'
04Nm 5:23 "Then the priest is to write all of these words in a document and wipe it off with the contaminated water. 
04Nm 5:24 The woman is to drink the bitter water that brings a curse and the water that brings a curse is to be considered contaminated. 
04Nm 5:25 Then priest is to take the offering of jealousy from the woman's hand, wave the offering in the Lord's presence, and have her approach the altar. 
04Nm 5:26 "The priest is to take a handful of grain from the memorial and offer a sacrifice on the altar, after which he is to have the woman drink the water. 
04Nm 5:27 When he has had her drink the water, if she was defiled and had acted unfaithfully toward her husband, then the contaminated water that brings a curse will enter her and infect her, causing her abdomen to swell and her thigh to waste away. Then she is to be a cursed woman among her people.
04Nm 5:28 "But if the woman isn't defiled, then she is to be freed and will be able to bear children. 
04Nm 5:29 This is the law in cases of jealousy when a woman defiles herself while under her husband's authority. 
04Nm 5:30 The husband will be free from guilt, but the wife is to bear the punishment of her iniquity."529
04Nm 6:1 Then the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 6:2 "Tell the Israelites that a man or woman who commits to the vow of the Nazarite, is to be separated to the Lord, 
04Nm 6:3 then is to separate from wine and strong drink. He is not to drink vinegar or strong drink made from wine. He is not to drink grape juice or eat grapes, whether fresh or dried.2
04Nm 6:4 "During the entire time of his dedication, he is not to eat any product from the grapevine, from seed to the skin.
04Nm 6:5 "During the entire time of his dedication, he is not to allow a razor to pass over his head until the days of his holy consecration to the Lord have been fulfilled. He is to let the locks on his head grow long.
04Nm 6:6 "During the entire time of his dedication, he is not to come near a dead body. 
04Nm 6:7 He is not to defile himself on account of his father, mother, brother, and sister when they die, because the crown of his consecration to God is on his head.
04Nm 6:8 "During the entire time of his dedication, he is set apart to God. 
04Nm 6:9 When someone suddenly beside him, so that his consecrated head is defiled, then he is to shave his head on the day of his purification. Seven days later he is to shave it again. 
04Nm 6:10 On the eighth day, he is to bring two turtledoves or two pigeons to the priest at the entrance of the tent of meeting.
04Nm 6:11 "Then the priest is to offer one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to make atonement for him because of the guilt he incurred on account of his contact with the dead body. Then he is to consecrate his head on that day. 
04Nm 6:12 He is to dedicate to the Lord the days of his consecration by bringing a year old male lamb as his offering. The previous time will have failed because his consecration became defiled.
04Nm 6:13 "This is the law of the Nazarite£º When the days of his consecration are completed, he is to come to the entrance at the tent of meeting. 
04Nm 6:14 He is to bring an offering to the Lord, a year old male lamb, and a year old ewe female lamb, both without blemish, for a sin offering and a ram without blemish for apeace offering, 
04Nm 6:15 a basket of unleavened bread made from choice flour, cakes mixed with oil, a wafer of unleavened bread smeared with oil, along with grain and drink offerings.
04Nm 6:16 "The priest is to come into the Lord's presence and present his sin and burnt offerings. 
04Nm 6:17 He is to offer the ram, a sacrifice of peace offering to the Lord, along with the basket of unleavened bread. Then the priest is to present his grain and drink offerings.
04Nm 6:18 "The Nazarite is then to shave his head of consecration at the entrance of the tent of meeting. He is to take the lock of his head of consecration and set it over the fire where the peace offering for sacrifice is. 
04Nm 6:19 Then the priest is to take the boiled shoulder of the ram, one cake of unleavened bread from the basket, and one wafer of unleavened bread. He is to place them in the hands of the Nazarite, after he himself has shaved his symbol of consecration. 
04Nm 6:20 The priest is to wave the offerings, that is, the breast and the thigh offering in the Lord's presence. Then the Nazarite may drink wine afterward.
04Nm 6:21 "This is to be the law of the Nazarite when he commits his offering to the Lord on account of his consecration, over and beyond what he owns alone plus whatever he can provide, based on the vow from his own mouth that he vows to fulfill on account of the law of his consecration."
04Nm 6:22 Later, the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 6:23 "Teach Aaron and his sons to bless the Israelites£º 
04Nm 6:24 May the Lord bless you and guard you.
04Nm 6:25 May the Lord's face enlighten you and bestow favor on you.
04Nm 6:26 May the Lord turn to face you, lavishing peace on you!
04Nm 6:27 They are to pour out my name to the Israelites while I continue to bless them."
04Nm 7:1 The same day that Moses finished setting up, anointing, and consecrating the tabernacle and its utensils, he also anointed and consecrated the altar and its utensils.
04Nm 7:2 Then the presiding leaders of Israel, as heads of the ancestral houses, brought an offering. They were the leaders of the tribes who supervised the census. 
04Nm 7:3 They brought their offering into the Lord's presence, consisting of six covered carts and twelve oxens - one cart each from two leaders and an ox from each one.
04Nm 7:4 After they presented them in front of the tabernacle, 4the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 7:5 "Take these gifts from them and use them in service at the tent of meeting. Present them to the Levites, distributing them to each person according to his work."
04Nm 7:6 So Moses took the carts and the oxen and presented them to the Levites. 
04Nm 7:7 Two carts and four oxen were given to the Gershonites for their work. 
04Nm 7:8 Four carts and eight oxen were given to the Merarites for their work. 
04Nm 7:9 But he gave none of them to the Kohathites, because their responsibility was to carry the holy things on their shoulders.
04Nm 7:10 The leaders brought the offerings for the dedication of the altar the same day that it was anointed. After the leaders brought their offering to the altar, 
04Nm 7:11 the Lord told Moses, "They are to present their offerings, one leader per day, for the dedication of the altar."

04Nm 7:89 When Moses entered the tent of meeting to speak with the Lord, he heard a voice speaking to him above the Mercy Seat over the ark of the testimony. He spoke to him from between the two cherubim.
04Nm 8:1 The Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 8:2 "Tell Aaron, 'When you set up the lamps, the seven lamps will illuminate the area in front of the lamp stand.'"
04Nm 8:3 So Aaron did so, setting up the lamps to illuminate the area in front of the lamp stand, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
04Nm 8:4 This was how the lamp stand was crafted from hammered gold£º From its base to its flowers, it was made of hammered gold. Just as Lord showed Moses, Moses crafted the lamp stand. 
04Nm 8:5 Then the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 8:6 "Take the Levites from the Israelites and purify them. 
04Nm 8:7 This is what you are to do for them in order to purify them£º Sprinkle purifying water over them, have them shave their skin, and then have them wash their garments, and they will be purifified. 
04Nm 8:8 They are to take a young bull along with its meal offering made of flour mixed with oil. "Then you are to take a second young bull as sin offering. 
04Nm 8:9 Assemble the Levites in front of the appointed place of meeting, and assemble the whole congregation of Israel, too. 
04Nm 8:10 Bring the Levites into the Lord's presence and have the Israelites lay their hands on the Levites.
04Nm 8:11 "Then Aaron is to present the Levites as a wave offering before the Lord from the Israelites, because they are to work in the service of the Lord. 
04Nm 8:12 The Levites are then to lay their hands on the head of the bulls, offering one for a sin offering and the other one for a burnt offering to the Lord to atone for the Levites.
04Nm 8:13 "You are to make the Levites stand in the presence of Aaron and his sons. Then you are to wave them as wave-offerings to the Lord. 
04Nm 8:14 This is how you are to separate the Levites from among the Israelites. The Levites belong to me.
04Nm 8:15 "After this, the Levites are to come to serve at the appointed place of meeting, after you have purified them and presented them as wave offerings, 
04Nm 8:16 since they've been set apart for me from among the Israelites.1"I've taken them for myself instead of the first to open the womb - every first born of the Israelites, 
04Nm 8:17 Since every firstborn of Israel belongs to me, from human beings to livestock. "On the same day that I destroyed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated them to myself, 
04Nm 8:18 taking the Levites instead of every firstborn of the Israelites. 
04Nm 8:19 I've set the Levites apart from the Israelites so that Aaron and his sons would work in service at the appointed place of meeting, making atonement on behalf of the Israelites so that there won't be a plague among the Israelites whenever they approach the sanctuary."
04Nm 8:20 So Moses and Aaron and the Israelites did this on behalf of the Levites. The Israelites did everything that the Lord commanded concerning the Levites. 
04Nm 8:21 The Levites therefore purified themselves, washed their clothes, and then Aaron presented them as wave offerings to the Lord. Aaron provided atonement for them to purify them.
04Nm 8:22 After this, the Levites entered into their work of service at the appointed place, in the presence of Aaron and his sons. They did everything that the Lord commanded Moses concerning the Levites.
04Nm 8:23 Later, the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 8:24 "Now regarding a Levite who is 
04Nm 8:25 years and above, he is to enter work in the service at the appointed place of meeting, 
04Nm 8:25 But starting at 50 years of age, he is to retire from service and is no longer to work.
04Nm 8:26 He may minister to his brothers at the tent of meeting by keeping watch, but he is not to engage in service. This how you are to act with respect to the obligations of the Levites. 825
04Nm 9:1 The Lord spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai during the first month of the second year that they had left Egypt, 
04Nm 9:2 "The Israelites are to observe the Passover at its appointed time 
04Nm 9:3 on the fourteenth day of this month. You are to observe it at this appointed time between the evenings. You are to observe it according to all its decrees and laws."
04Nm 9:4 So Moses instructed the Israelites to observe the Passover. 
04Nm 9:5 They observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at twilight, in the Wilderness of Sinai. The Israelites did everything that the Lord had commanded through Moses.
04Nm 9:6 But there were men who couldn't observe the Passover that day because they had come in contact with a corpse. That very day, they approached Moses and Aaron 
04Nm 9:7 and asked, "Why can't we bring an offering to the Lord at the appointed time among the Israelites, even though we are unclean because we came in contact with a corpse?"
04Nm 9:8 "Wait while I hear what the Lord has to say about you," Moses replied.
04Nm 9:9 Then the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 9:10 "Instruct the Israelites that when any of you or your descendants becomes unclean due to contact with a corpse, or if he is on a long journey, he nevertheless is to observe the Lord's Passover. 
04Nm 9:11 On fourteenth day of the second month at twilight, they are to eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 
04Nm 9:12 They are not to leave any of it to remain until morning nor are they to break any of its bones. They are to observe it according to all the statutes of the Passover.
04Nm 9:13 "Now as to the person who is clean and isn't traveling, but fails to observe the Passover, that person is to be eliminated from his people, because he didn't bring an offering to the Lord at its appointed time. That person is to bear his sin.
04Nm 9:14 "If a resident alien lives with you and wants to observe the Lord's Passover, let him observe it according to the statutes and laws of the Passover. You are to maintain the same statute for the resident alien as you do for the native of the land.
04Nm 9:15 On the same morning that the tabernacle was set up, a cloud covered the tabernacle, that is, the tent of the testimony, and in the evening fire appeared over the tabernacle until morning. 
04Nm 9:16 It was so continuously - there was a cloud covering by day, and a fire cloud appeared at night.
04Nm 9:17 Whenever the cloud above the tent ascended, the Israelites would travel and encamp in the place where the cloud settled. 
04Nm 9:18 According to whatever the Lord said, the Israelites would travel. According to whatever the Lord said, they would camp as long as the cloud remained over the tent of meeting.
04Nm 9:19 When the cloud over the tabernacle remained for a longer time, the Israelites did what the Lord had instructed and didn't travel. 
04Nm 9:20 There were times when the cloud remained over the tabernacle for a number days. They camped in accordance with the Lord's instructions and they traveled in accordance with Lord's instructions. 
04Nm 9:21 There were times when the cloud remained from evening until morning, but when the cloud ascended in the morning, they would journey. Whether by day or by night, they would travel whenever the cloud ascended. 
04Nm 9:22 Whether for two days, a month, or for longer periods, whenever the cloud would remain above the tabernacle, the Israelites would remain in camp, not traveling. But whenever it ascended, then they would travel. 
04Nm 9:23 According to what the Lord said, they would remain in camp, and according to what the Lord said, they would travel. They kept the commands that the Lord had given through Moses.
04Nm 10:1 The Lord also told Moses, 
04Nm 10:2 "Make two trumpets, crafting them from beaten silver, for use in calling the congregation together and for notifying the camps to set out for travel. 
04Nm 10:3 Sound them when the whole assembly is to gather together at the entrance of the appointed place of meeting.
04Nm 10:4 "When one trumpet is blown, the elders and the heads of the thousands of the Israelites are to gather to you. 
04Nm 10:5 When you sound an alarm, the ones encamped on the east side are to begin to travel.
04Nm 10:6 "When you sound the alarm the second time, those encamped on the south are to begin to travel. Alarms are to be sounded for their travels.
04Nm 10:7 "But when you blow the trumpet to assemble the whole congregation, don't use the same sound as you do for sounding an alarm.
04Nm 10:8 "The descendants of Aaron the priest are to blow the trumpets. Have them do this for you permanently throughout your generations to come."
04Nm 10:9 When you wage war in your land against an enemy who is hostile to you, you are to sound an alarm with the trumpets. Then you will be remembered before the face of the Lord your God and you will be delivered from your enemies. 
04Nm 10:10 At the beginning of the month, during your time of rejoicing at the appointed place, sound the trumpet over your burnt offering, then sacrifice your peace offering, since they are to be your memorial before the Lord your God. I am the Lord your God. 
04Nm 10:11 On twentieth day of the second month in the second year, the cloud was lifted up from the tabernacle of the testimony, 
04Nm 10:12 so the Israelites set out from the Sinai Wilderness until the cloud settled in the Paran Wilderness, 
04Nm 10:13 doing what the Lord had said according through Moses.
04Nm 10:14 The standard of the camp of Judah was the first to travel, accompanied by its army with Amminadab's son Nahshon in charge. 
04Nm 10:15 Zuar's son Nethaneel was in charge of the camp of Issachar. 
04Nm 10:16 Helon's son Eliab was in charge of the camp of Zebulon. 
04Nm 10:17 The tabernacle was taken down, and the descendants of Gershon and Merari carried the tabernacle.
04Nm 10:18 Then the standard of the camp of Reuben set out, accompanied by its army, with Shedeur's son Elizur in charge. 
04Nm 10:19 Zurishaddai's son Shelumiel was in charge of the tribe of Simeon. 
04Nm 10:20 Deuel's son Eliasaph was in charge of the tribe of Gad. 
04Nm 10:21 Then the Kohathites, carrying the sanctuary, set out, since the tabernacle was to be set up before they arrive.
04Nm 10:22 After this, the standard of the camp of Ephraim set out, accompanied by its army with Ammihud's son Elishama in charge. 
04Nm 10:23 Pedazzur's son Gamaliel was in charge of the tribe of Manasseh. 
04Nm 10:24 Gideoni's son Abidan was in charge of the army of the tribe of Benjamin.
04Nm 10:25 Then the standard of the camp of Dan set out, functioning as the rear guard for all the encampments, accompanied by its army with Ammishaddai's son Ahiezer. 
04Nm 10:26 Ocran's son Pagiel was in charge of the tribe of Asher. 
04Nm 10:27 Enan's son Ahira was in charge of the tribe of Naphtali.
04Nm 10:28 This was the travel order for the Israelites, whenever their companies traveled. 
04Nm 10:29 Then Moses said to Ruel's son Hobab from Midian, Moses' father-in-law, "We are traveling to the place about which the Lord said 'I will give it to you.' So Come with us and we'll be good to you, because the Lord has spoken good things about Israel."
04Nm 10:30 But he said, "I won't go with you because I'm returning to my land and to my own family."
04Nm 10:31 Then Moses responded, "Please don't leave us now, since you know where we can camp in the wilderness. You could be our guide. 
04Nm 10:32 And when you come with us, the good things that the Lord will grant us, we'll give you as well."
04Nm 10:33 So they traveled from the mountain of the Lord, a trip of three day, with the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord traveling in front of them - a three day trip to explore a place for them to rest. 
04Nm 10:34 Moreover, the cloud of the Lord protected them during the day when they left their camp.
04Nm 10:35 Whenever the ark was ready to travel, Moses would say£º "Arise, Lord, to scatter your enemies, so that whoever hates you will flee from your presence."
04Nm 10:36 Whenever the ark was being readied to rest, he would say£º "Return, Lord, to the countless thousands of Israel."
04Nm 11:1 Eventually, as soon as the people began complaining about their distress, the Lord heard. When the Lord heard it, his anger flared up and the Lord's fire incinerated some of them within the outskirts of the camp. 
04Nm 11:2 When the people cried out to Moses, he prayed to the Lord and the fire stopped. 
04Nm 11:3 He then named that place Taberah, because the Lord's fire had incinerated some of them.
04Nm 11:4 Meanwhile, certain riff-raff among the people had an insatiable appetite for food. As a result, they wept and turned back, and the Israelites cried out, "If only somebody would feed us some meat! 
04Nm 11:5 How we remember the fish that we used to eat in Egypt for free! And the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic! 
04Nm 11:6 But now we can't stand it any more, because there's nothing in front of us except this manna." 5
04Nm 11:7 Now manna was reminiscent of coriander seed, with an appearance similar to amber. 
04Nm 11:8 People would go out to gather it, then they would grind it in mills or pound it in mortars, and then they would boil it in pots or make cakes out of it that tasted like butter cakes. 
04Nm 11:9 When the dew fell in the camp, the manna came with it.
04Nm 11:10 Moses heard the people weeping throughout their entire families. Everyone gathered at the entrance of their tents so that the Lord was very angry. Moses thought the situation was bad, 
04Nm 11:11 so he asked the Lord, "Why did you bring all this trouble to your servant -  Why haven't I found favor in your eyes -  After all, you're putting the burden of this entire people on me!
04Nm 11:12 "Did I conceive this people or give birth to them, so that you would tell me to carry them near my heart like a wet nurse carries a suckling baby to the land that you promised to their forefathers -  
04Nm 11:13 Where am I going to get meat to give this people -  After all, they're crying in front of me, 'Give us meat to eat!' 
04Nm 11:14 I cannot carry this whole nation! The burden is too heavy for me! 
04Nm 11:15 If this is how you treat me, please kill me right now, if I've found favor in your eyes, because I don't want to keep starting at all of this misery!"
04Nm 11:16 Then the Lord told Moses, "Gather together for me 70 men who are elders of Israel, men whom you know to be elders of the people and officers over them. Then bring them to the tent of meeting and let them stand there with you. 
04Nm 11:17 Then I'll come down and speak with you. I'll take some of the spirit that rests on you and apportion it among them, so that they may help you bear the burden of the people. That way, you won't bear it by yourself.
04Nm 11:18 "But give this command to the people£º 'You are to consecrate yourselves, because tomorrow you're going to eat meat, since you've complained where the Lord can hear it, "Who can give us meat to eat -  After all, life was better with us in Egypt."' Therefore, the Lord is going to give you meat and you'll eat -  
04Nm 11:19 not only for a day, or for two days, or for five days, or for ten days, or for 20 days, 
04Nm 11:20 but for a whole month - until it comes out your nostrils and makes you vomit. This is because you've despised the Lord, who is among you, and you cried out in his presence, complaining, 'Why did we ever leave of Egypt?'"
04Nm 11:21 Moses responded, "I'm with 600,000 people on foot and you're saying I am to give them enough meat to eat for a whole month -  
04Nm 11:22 What if we were to slaughter our entire inventory of flocks and herds for them -  Would that be enough -  What if we could gather all the fish in the sea in nets for them -  Would that be enough, either?"
04Nm 11:23 But the Lord responded to Moses, "Is the Lord short on power -  You're now going to witness whether what I say will come to pass or not."
04Nm 11:24 So Moses went out and told the people what the Lord had said. He gathered 70 men from the elders of the people and stationed them around the tent. 
04Nm 11:25 The Lord came down in a cloud, spoke to Moses, and made an apportionment from the spirit who rested on him to the 70 elders. When the spirit rested on them, they prophesied, but that was it. 
04Nm 11:26 Now two men rhad emained in camp. One was named Eldad and the other was named Medad. When the spirit rested on them, since they were among those who were listed but had not gone out to the tent, they stayed behind and prophesied in the camp.
04Nm 11:27 A young man ran and reported to Moses, "Eldad and Meldad are prophesying in the camp!"
04Nm 11:28 In response, Nun's son Joshua, Moses' attendant and one of his choice men, exclaimed, "My master Moses! Stop them!"
04Nm 11:29 "Are you jealous on account of me?" Moses asked in reply. "I wish all of the Lord's people were prophets and that the Lord would put his spirit upon them!" 
04Nm 11:30 Then Moses - that is, he and the elders of Israel - returned to the camp.
04Nm 11:31 Just then, a wind burst forth from the Lord, who brought quails from the sea and spread them all around the camp, about a day's journey in each direction, completely encircling the camp about three feet deep on top of the ground! 
04Nm 11:32 The people stayed up all that day, all that night, and all through the next day, gathering quails. The one who gathered least gathered enough to fill ten 80-gallon drums, as they spread out all around the camp. 
04Nm 11:33 But even as they were chewing the meat and before they had swalloed it, the Lord became very angry with the people and struck them with a disasterous plague. 
04Nm 11:34 That's why the place was named Kibroth-hattaavah, because they buried the people there who had an insatiable appetite for meat. 
04Nm 11:35 Later, the people left Kibroth-hattaavah for Hazeroth and camped there.1134
04Nm 12:1 Miriam and Aaron rebelled against Moses on account of the Cushite woman that he had married. 
04Nm 12:2 They asked, "Has the Lord spoken only through Moses -  Hasn't he also spoken through us?" But the Lord heard it.
04Nm 12:3 Now the man Moses was very humble - more than any person on earth.
04Nm 12:4 All of a sudden, the Lord said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam£º "The three of you are to come out to the tent of meeting." So the three of them went out. 
04Nm 12:5 Then the Lord came down in a pillar of cloud, stood at the entrance to the tent of meeting, and summoned Aaron and Miriam. So both of them went forward.
04Nm 12:6 Then he said to the two of them£º "Pay attention to what I have to say! When there is a prophet among you, won't I, the Lord, reveal myself to him in a vision -  Won't I speak with him in a dream - 
04Nm 12:7 "But that's not how it is with my servant Moses, since he has been entrusted with my entire household! 
04Nm 12:8 I speak to him audibly and in visions, not in mysteries. If he can gaze at the image of the Lord, why aren't you afraid to speak against my servant Moses?" 
04Nm 12:9 Because the Lord was very angry with them, he left, 
04Nm 12:10 but when the cloud ascended from the tent, Miriam had become leprous, as white as snow! Aaron turned toward Miriam, and she had leprosy!
04Nm 12:11 Aaron begged Moses, "I pray my lord, please don't hold this sin against us, since we've acted foolishlyandsinnedindoingso.
04Nm 12:12 Please don't let her be like one of the living dead, who is born with a congenital skin disease."
04Nm 12:13 So Moses prayed to the Lord£º "O Lord, please heal her."
04Nm 12:14 But the Lord told Moses, "If her father had merely spit in her face, wouldn't she be humiliated -  She is to be placed in isolation for seven days. After that, she may be brought in." 
04Nm 12:15 So Miriam was isolated outside the camp for seven days and the people didn't travel until Miriam was brought in. 
04Nm 12:16 After that, the people traveled from Hazeroth and encamped in the Wilderness of Paran.
04Nm 13:1 Later, the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 13:2 Send men to explore the land of Canaan that I'm about to give to the Israelites. Send one man to represent each of his ancestor's tribes, every one of them a distinguished leader among them."
04Nm 13:3 So that's just what Moses did, sending them from the Wilderness of Paran according to the Lord's instructions. Each of the men were Israelite leaders. 
04Nm 13:4 These were their names£º From Reuben tribe, Zaccur's son Shammua; 
04Nm 13:5 From Simeon's tribe, Hori's son Shaphat; 
04Nm 13:6 From Judah's tribe, Jephunneh's son Caleb; 
04Nm 13:7 from Issachar's tribe, Joseph's son Igal; 
04Nm 13:8 From Ephraim's tribe, Nun's son Hosea; 
04Nm 13:9 From Benjamin's tribe, Raphu's son Palti; 
04Nm 13:10 from Zebulun's tribe, Sodi's son Gaddiel; 
04Nm 13:11 from Joseph's tribe of Manasseh, Susi's son Gaddi; 
04Nm 13:12 From Dan's tribe, Gemalli's son Ammiel; 
04Nm 13:13 from Asher's tribe, Michael's son Sethur; 
04Nm 13:14 from Naphtali's tribe, Vophsi's son Nahbi; 
04Nm 13:15 and from Gad's tribe, Machi's son Geuel. 
04Nm 13:16 These are the names of the men sent by Moses to explore the land. Moses renamed Nun's son Hoshea to Joshua. 
04Nm 13:17 Then he sent them out to explore the land of Canaan. He instructed them, "Go up from here by way of the Negev, then ascend to the hill country. 
04Nm 13:18 See what the land is like. Observe whether the people who live there are strong or weak, or whether they're few or numerous. 
04Nm 13:19 Inspect whether the land where they live is good or bad, and whether the cities in which they live are merely tents or if they're fortified. 
04Nm 13:20 Examine the farmland, whether it's fertile or barren, and see if there are fruit-bearing trees in it or not. Be very courageous, and bring back some samples of the fruit of the land." As it was, that time of year was the season for the first-fruits of the grape harvest. 
04Nm 13:21 So they went to explore the land from the Wilderness of Zin to Rehob, and as far as the outskirts of Hamath. 
04Nm 13:22 They went by way of the Negev and reached Hebron, where Ahaiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the descendants of Anak lived. (Hebron had been constructed seven years before Zoan in Egypt had been built).
04Nm 13:23 Soon they arrived in the valley of Eshcol, where they cut a single branch of grapes and carried it on a pole between two men, along with some pomegranates and figs. 
04Nm 13:24 The entire place was called the Eshcol Valley on account of the cluster of grapes that the men of Israel had taken from there.
04Nm 13:25 At the end of 40 days they all returned from exploring the land, 
04Nm 13:26 came in to Moses and Aaron, and delivered their report to the entire congregation of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran at Kadesh. They brought back their report to the entire congregation and showed them the fruit of the land.
04Nm 13:27 "We arrived at the place where you've sent us," they reported, "and it certainly does flow with milk and honey. Furthermore, this is its fruit, 
04Nm 13:28 except that the people who have settled in the land are strong, and their cities are greatly fortified. We also saw the descendants of Anak. 
04Nm 13:29 Amalek lives throughout the Negev, while the Hittites, Jebusites, and Amorites live in the hill country. The Canaanites live by the sea and on the bank of the Jordan. "28
04Nm 13:30 Caleb silenced the people on Moses' behalf and responded, "Let's go up and take control, because we can definitely conquer it."
04Nm 13:31 "We can't attack those people," the men who were with him said, "because they're too strong compared to us."
04Nm 13:32 So they put out this false report to the Israelites about the land that they had explored£º "The land that we've explored is one that devours its inhabitants. All the people whom we observed were giants. 
04Nm 13:33 We also saw the Nephilim, the descendants of Anak. Compared to the Nephilim, as we see things, we're like grasshoppers and that's their opinion of us!13"
04Nm 14:1 At this, the entire assembly complained, started to shout, and cried through the rest of that night. 
04Nm 14:2 All the Israelites complained against Moses and Aaron. Then the entire assembly responded, "We wish that we had died in Egypt or in this wilderness. 
04Nm 14:3 What's the point in the Lord bringing us to this land -  To die by the sword so our wives and children would become war victims -  Wouldn't it be better for us to return to Egypt?"
04Nm 14:4 Then they said to each other, "Let's assign a leader and go back to Egypt."
04Nm 14:5 Moses and Aaron fell on their faces in front of the entire assembly of the congregation of Israel. 
04Nm 14:6 Nun's son Joshua and Jephunneh's son Caleb, who had accompanied the others who also had explored the land, tore their clothes 
04Nm 14:7 and attempted to reason with the entire congregation of Israel. They told them, "The land that we went through and explored is very, very good. 
04Nm 14:8 If the Lord is pleased with us, he'll bring us into this land and give it to us. It flows with milk and honey. 
04Nm 14:9 However, don't rebel against the Lord or be afraid of the people who live in the land, because we'll gobble them right up.  Their defenses will collapse, because the Lord is with us. You are not to be afraid of them."
04Nm 14:10 But the entire congregation was talking about stoning them to death. Suddenly, the glory of the Lord appeared at the tent of meeting to all of the Israelites. 
04Nm 14:11 "How long will this people keep on spurning me and refusing to trust me, despite all the miracles that I've done among them?" the Lord asked Moses. 
04Nm 14:12 "That's why I'm going to attack them them with pestilence and disinherit them. Instead, I'll make you a great nation - even mightier than they are!"
04Nm 14:13 But Moses responded to the Lord, "When Egypt hears that you've brought this people out from among them with a mighty demonstration of power, 
04Nm 14:14 they'll also proclaim to the inhabitants of this land that they've heard you're among this people, Lord, whom they've seen face to face, since your your cloud stands guard over them. You've guided them with a pillar of cloud by day and with a pillar of fire by night.
04Nm 14:15 "But if you slaughter this people all at the same time, then the nations who heard about your fame will say, 
04Nm 14:16 'The Lord slaughtered this people in the wilderness because he wasn't able to bring them to the land that he promised them.'
04Nm 14:17 "Now, let the power of the Lord be magnified, just as you promised when you said, 
04Nm 14:18 'The Lord is slow to anger and abundant in faithful love, forgiving iniquity and transgression, but he won't acquit the guilty. He recalls the iniquity of fathers to the third and fourth generation.'
04Nm 14:19 "Forgive, please, the iniquity of this people, according to your great, faithful love, in the same way that you've carried this people from Egypt to this place."
04Nm 14:20 The Lord responded, "I've forgiven them based on what you've said. 
04Nm 14:21 But just as I live, and just as the whole earth will be filled with the Lord's glory, 
04Nm 14:22 none of those men who saw my glory and watched my miracles that I did in Egypt and in the wilderness - even though they've tested me these ten times and never listened to my voice -  
04Nm 14:23 will ever see the land that I promised to their ancestors. Those who spurned me won't see it.
04Nm 14:24 "Now as to my servant Caleb, because a different spirit is within him and he has remained true to me, I'm going to bring him into the land that he explored, and his descendants are to inherit it. 
04Nm 14:25 Now the Amalekite and the Canaanite live in the valley. Tomorrow, turn then travel to the wilderness in the direction of the Red Sea."
04Nm 14:26 Then the Lord told Moses and Aaron,
04Nm 14:27 "How long will this wicked assembly keep complaining about me -  I've heard the complaints of the Israelites that they've been murmuring against me. 
04Nm 14:28 So tell them that as long as I live - consider this to be an oracle from the Lord - as certainly as you've spoken right into my ears, that's how I'm going to treat you. 
04Nm 14:29 Your corpses will fall in this wilderness - every single one of you who has been counted among you, according to your number from 20 years and above, who complained against me.
04Nm 14:30 "You will certainly never enter the land about which I made an oath with my uplifted hand to settle you in it, except for Jephunneh's son Caleb and Nun's son Joshua. 
04Nm 14:31 However, I'll bring your little ones  - the ones whom you claimed would become war victims - into the land so that they'll know by experience the land that you've rejected.14
04Nm 14:32 "Now as for you, your corpses will fall in this wilderness 
04Nm 14:33 and your children will wander throughout the wilderness for 40 years. They'll bear the consequences of your idolatries until your bodies are entirely consumed in the wilderness. 
04Nm 14:34 Just as you explored the land for 40 days, you'll bear the consequences of your iniquities for 40 years - one year for each day - as you experience my hostility. 
04Nm 14:35 I, the Lord have spoken. "I will indeed do this to this evil congregation, who gathered together against me. They'll be eliminated in this wilderness and will surely die."
04Nm 14:36 After this, the men whom Moses sent out to explore the land, who returned and made the whole congregation complain against him by bringing an evil report concerning the land, 
04Nm 14:37 and who produced an evil report about the land, died of pestilence in the Lord's presence. 
04Nm 14:38 However, Nun's son Joshua and Jephunneh's son Caleb, who had explored the land, remained alive. 
04Nm 14:39 After Moses had told all of this to the Israelites, the people deeply mourned. 
04Nm 14:40 So they got up early the next morning and traveled to the top of the mountain, telling themselves, "Look, we're here and we're going to go up to the place that the Lord had spoken about, even though we've sinned."
04Nm 14:41 But Moses asked them, "Why do you continue to sin against what the Lord said -  Don't you know that you can never succeed -  
04Nm 14:42 Don't go up, since you know that Lord is no longer with you. You'll be attacked right in front of your own enemies. 
04Nm 14:43 The Amalekites and Canaanites are there waiting for you. You'll die violently, since you've turned your back and have stopped following the Lord. The Lord won't be with you."
04Nm 14:44 But they presumed to go up to the top of the mountain, even though the ark of the covenant of the Lord and Moses didn't leave the camp. 
04Nm 14:45 The Amalekites came down, accompanied by some Canaanites who lived in the mountains. They attacked and defeated them even while the Israelites were retreating to Hormah.
04Nm 15:1 Later, the Lord instructed Moses, 
04Nm 15:2 "Tell the Israelites that 
04Nm 15:3 when you enter the land where you'll be living that I'm about to give you, you are to make an offering by fire to the Lord, either a burnt offering, a sacrificial offering to fulfill a vow, or a voluntary offering at the appointed time, to make a pleasing aroma to the Lord either from your cattle or from your flocks.
04Nm 15:4 "The offeror is to bring the oblation to the Lord, containing one tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a grain offering, mixed with one fourth of a hin of olive oil.
04Nm 15:5 "Also prepare one fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering or for the sacrifice of each lamb.
04Nm 15:6 "For a ram, prepare a grain offering consisting of two tenths of  an ephah of fine flour mixed with one third of a hin of olive oil. 
04Nm 15:7 "Now as for your drink offering, offer one third of a hin of wine as a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
04Nm 15:8 "When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering, or as a sacrifice to fulfill a vow, or for peace offerings to the Lord, 
04Nm 15:9 then the bullock is to be presented accompanied by a meal offering of three tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil.
04Nm 15:10 "As for drink offering, offer half a hin of wine, for an offering made by fire is a pleasing aroma to the Lord. 
04Nm 15:11 Do this for each bullock, ram, male lamb, or goat. 
04Nm 15:12 Depending on the number of offerings that you prepare, do for each one according to their number. 
04Nm 15:13 "Every native born person is to do these things, bringing an offering made by fire as a pleasing aroma to the Lord."
04Nm 15:14 "Now, if a resident alien lives with you, or whoever else is with you throughout your generations, let him make an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the Lord. Just as you do, so is he to do. 
04Nm 15:15 There is to be a single standard for your community, one statute for you and the resident alien who lives with you, a long lasting statute throughout your generations. Just as you do, so is the resident alien to do in the presence of the Lord. 
04Nm 15:16 There is to be one law and one ordinance for you and for the resident alien who lives with you."
04Nm 15:17 Then the Lord instructed Moses£º 
04Nm 15:18 "Tell the Israelites that when they enter the land that I'm about to bring you to, 
04Nm 15:19 when you have eaten some of the bread that the land produces, you are to offer a raised offering to the Lord. 
04Nm 15:20 You are to offer a cake made from the first of your bread dough as a raised offering to the Lord. Offer it as a raised offering right off your threshing floor. 
04Nm 15:21 From  then on, throughout your generations give the first of your bread dough to the Lord.20
04Nm 15:22 "Here's what you are to do when you all go astray and fail to observe all these commands that the Lord had spoken to Moses, 
04Nm 15:23 including anything that the Lord commanded you by the authority of Moses, starting from the day the Lord commanded Moses and continuing through your generations.  
04Nm 15:24 When anything is done without the knowledge of the congregation, the entire community is to offer one young bull for a burnt offering, a pleasing aroma to the Lord, along with its meal and drink offerings offered according to procedure, and one male goat for a sin offering. 
04Nm 15:25 Then the priest is to make atonement for the entire community of the Israelites, and they will be forgiven for inadvertent sins. They are to bring their offering, an offering made by fire to the Lord, as well as their sin offering, into the Lord's presence on account of their error. 
04Nm 15:26 Then the entire community of Israel, will be forgiven, along with the resident alien who lives among them, since all the people will have sinned inadvertently."
04Nm 15:27 "Now when one person sins inadvertently, then he is to bring a one year old female goat for a sin offering. 
04Nm 15:28 Then, in the Lord's presence, the priest is to make atonement for the person who sinned inadvertently, that is, to make atonement on his behalf so he may be forgiven. 
04Nm 15:29 You are to have a single law for the one who does things inadvertently, whether for the native-born Israelite or for the resident alien who lives among you.
04Nm 15:30 "But if some person acts with a high hand, whether a native-born or a resident alien, he blasphemes God, and that person is to be eliminated from among his people. 
04Nm 15:31 Because he has despised the law of the Lord and has broken his commands, that person is certainly to be eliminated. His iniquity will remain on him."
04Nm 15:32 As it was when the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man who was gathering wood on the Sabbath day. 
04Nm 15:33 The ones who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses, Aaron, and all the people. 
04Nm 15:34 Then they confined him until it could be declared what should be done to him.
04Nm 15:35 Then the Lord said to Moses, "The man is certainly to die. The entire community is to stone him to death outside the camp." 
04Nm 15:36 So the whole community brought him outside the camp and stoned him with stones so that he died, just as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
04Nm 15:37 Later, the Lord instructed Moses, 
04Nm 15:38 "Tell the Israelites that they are to make tassels at the edges of their garments throughout their generations and that they are to put a violet cord on the tassels at the edges of their garments. 
04Nm 15:39 That way, when you see the tassel, you'll remember all the commands of the Lord and you'll observe them. Then you won't seek your own interests and desires that lead you to be unfaithful. 
04Nm 15:40 Therefore remember to observe all my commands and to be holy in the presence of your God. 
04Nm 15:41 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the Lord your God.
04Nm 16:1 Now Izhar's son Korah, the grandson of Kohath, a Levite, along with Eliab's sons Dathan and Abiram, and Peleth's son On, a descendant of Reuben, took charge 
04Nm 16:2 of a rebellion against Moses, along with 250 community leaders, Israelites who were famous men and representatives from the assembly.
04Nm 16:3 They gathered together against Moses and Aaron and said to them, "You have appropriated too much for yourselves from the entire congregation, since all of them are holy, and the Lord is among them, too. Why do you exalt yourselves over the Lord's assembly?"
04Nm 16:4 When Moses heard this, he fell on his face. 
04Nm 16:5 Then he addressed Korah and his entire company, "In the morning, may the Lord reveal who belongs to him and who is holy. May he cause that person to approach him. May he cause to approach him the one whom he has chosen. 
04Nm 16:6 Korah, you and your entire company, are to bring censers, 
04Nm 16:7 put fire and incense in them in the Lord's presence tomorrow. It will be that the man whom the Lord chooses will be holy. You're taking too much for yourselves, you Levites."
04Nm 16:8 Moses also told Korah, "Listen now, you Levites! 
04Nm 16:9 Is it such an insignificant thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the Israelites to draw you to himself, appointing you to do the work of the tabernacle of the Lord and to stand before the community to minister to them -  
04Nm 16:10 He brought you near, along with all of your relatives, the Levites. Are you also seeking the priesthood -  
04Nm 16:11 Therefore you and your group have conspired against the Lord and Aaron. What is it that causes you to complain against him?"
04Nm 16:12 So Moses sent for Eliab's sons Dathan and Abiram, but they responded, "We're not coming. 
04Nm 16:13 Is it such an insignificant thing that you brought us out of a land flowing with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness -  Now you're trying to make yourself be a prince and rule over us, aren't you -  
04Nm 16:14 You still haven't brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor have you given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Do you really think that you can make these men look the other way -  We won't go up."13
04Nm 16:15 Moses was very angry, so he told the Lord, "Please don't accept their offering. I haven't taken even one donkey from them nor have I hurt even one of them."
04Nm 16:16 Then Moses said to Korah, "You and your entire company are to present yourselves in the Lord's presence tomorrow - you, they, and Aaron. 
04Nm 16:17 Each man is to takes a censer, put incense on it, and bring it ino the Lord's presence, each man with his censer, for a total of 250 censers. You and Aaron are each to bring his own censer."
04Nm 16:18 So each man took his censer, put fire coals inside of it, placed incense in it, and then stood at the entrance of the tent of meeting, accompanied by Moses and Aaron. 
04Nm 16:19 When Korah had assembled the entire community in opposition to Moses and Aaron at the entrance of the tent of meeting, the glory of the Lord appeared to the entire community.
04Nm 16:20 Then the Lord told Moses and Aaron, 
04Nm 16:21 "Separate yourselves from among this community, and I'll destroy them in a moment."
04Nm 16:22 Then they fell on their faces and said, "God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, will you be angry at the entire congregation on account of one man's sin?"
04Nm 16:23 Then the Lord instructed Moses, 
04Nm 16:24 "Tell the community to move away from where Korah, Dathan, and Abiram are living."
04Nm 16:25 So Moses got up and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. 
04Nm 16:26 Then he told the community, "Move away from the camps of these wicked men and don't touch anything that belongs to them. That way you won't be destroyed along with all their sins."  
04Nm 16:27 So they all moved away from the entire area where Korah, Dathan, and Abiram were living. Now Korah, Dathan, and Abiram stood at the entrance of their tents with their wives, sons, and little children. 
04Nm 16:28 Then Moses said, "This is how you'll know that the Lord has sent me to do all these awesome works - they're not coming merely from me. 
04Nm 16:29 If these people die a death similar to all other human beings, or if they are punished with a punishment common to other men, then the Lord didn't send me. 
04Nm 16:30 But if the Lord creates something new, so that the ground opens its mouth and swallows them and everything that belongs to them and they all descend directly to Sheol while still alive, then you'll know that these men have spurned the Lord."
04Nm 16:31 Just as he finished saying all these things, the ground under them split open. 
04Nm 16:32 The earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, all their households, everyone who was affiliated with Korah, and all of their property. 
04Nm 16:33 So they and all that belonged to them descended alive to Sheol. Then the earth closed over them. That's how they were annihilated from the assembly.
04Nm 16:34 Then all of the Israelites who were around them ran away when they heard them crying, "¡¦so the ground won't swallow us up, too."
04Nm 16:35 After this, fire came from the Lord and incinerated the 250 men who offered the incense.
04Nm 16:36 Then the Lord instructed Moses, 
04Nm 16:37 "Tell Aaron's son Eleazar the priest to take out the censers out of the flames and scatter the coals far away, since they are holy. 
04Nm 16:38 As for the censers of those rebels who died, fasten them into beaten plates to line the altar. Since they brought them into the Lord's presence, they're holy. They are to become a reminder to the Israelites."
04Nm 16:39 So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers that had been burned and beat them into metal plates for the altar, 
04Nm 16:40 to serve as a memorial to the Israelites, a reminder that no unauthorized person, who isn't a descendant of Aaron is to attempt to burn incense in the Lord's presence, so that he may not become like Korah and his group, just as the Lord had spoken by the authority of Moses. 
04Nm 16:41 Nevertheless, the very next day, the whole congregation of Israel complained against Moses and Aaron, "You've killed the Lord's people!"
04Nm 16:42 When the community gathered together against Moses and Aaron, they turned toward the tent of meeting. All of a sudden, a cloud covered it and the glory of the Lord appeared. 
04Nm 16:43 Then Moses and Aaron entered the tent of meeting.
04Nm 16:44 The Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 16:45 "Leave this community, so I can annihilate them in a moment." But they fell upon their faces. 
04Nm 16:46 Then Moses said to Aaron. "Take the censer, put fire on it from the altar, and burn some incense. Then walk quickly to the congregation and atone for them, because wrath has already come out from the Lord - the plague has begun." 16
04Nm 16:47 So Aaron took the censer, just as Moses had spoken, and ran out to the center of the assembly, where a plague had begun among the people. He set the incense on fire and atoned for the people. 
04Nm 16:48 He stood between the dead and the living and restrained the plague. 
04Nm 16:49 Those who died due to the plague numbered 14,700, not counting those who died due to the matter with Korah.1648
04Nm 16:50 Then Aaron returned to Moses at the entrance of the tent of meeting after the slaughter had been restrained.
04Nm 17:1 The Lord instructed Moses, 
04Nm 17:2 "Tell the Israelites to take a rod - one from each ancestral house, that is, one from every leader, for a total of twelve rods. Write each tribal name on his rod. 
04Nm 17:3 You are also to write Aaron's name on the tribe of Levi, since there is to be one rod for every leader of their ancestors's tribes.2
04Nm 17:4 "Then lay them there in the tent of meeting in front of the Ark of the Covenant where I'll meet with you. 
04Nm 17:5 The rod that belongs to the man whom I'll choose will burst into bloom. That's how I'll put a stop to the complaints of the Israelites, who are complaining against you."17
04Nm 17:6 So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of the tribe leaders gave him a rod, one for each leader, according to their ancestral tribes, for a total of twelve rods. Aaron's rod was one of them. 
04Nm 17:7 Then Moses laid out the rods in the Lord's presence, inside the tent of the testimony. 
04Nm 17:8 The next morning, Moses went to the tent of the testimony and the rod of Aaron of the tribe of Levi had burst into bloom! It sprouted buds, bloomed blossoms, and produced fully ripe almonds! 
04Nm 17:9 Then Moses took out all the rods from the Lord's presence to show all the Israelites. Everybody looked, and  then each man took his rod.
04Nm 17:10 Then the Lord instructed Moses, "Return Aaron's rod before the testimony to be kept for a sign of against the rebels so that you may put an end to their complaints against me so that they won't die."
04Nm 17:11 So Moses did exactly what the Lord had commanded him to do. 
04Nm 17:12 Then the Israelites said to Moses, "We're sure to die! We're all going to perish - all of us! 13Anyone who comes near or approaches the Lord's tabernacle is to die. Are all of us going to die?"
04Nm 18:1 Later, the Lord said to Aaron, "You, your sons, and your father's tribe with you are to bear the iniquity of the sanctuary. Also, you and your sons with you are to bear the iniquity of your priesthood.
04Nm 18:2 "Moreover, bring your brothers from your father's tribe of Levi with you, so they may join you and minister to you while you and your sons with you stand in the presence of the tent of the testimony. 
04Nm 18:3 They are to take care of your concerns and all the responsibilities involved with the tent. "But they're not to approach the holy vessels or the altar. That way, neither you nor they will die. 
04Nm 18:4 They are to join you to maintain services related to the tent of meeting, for all the responsibilities ivolved with the tent. But no unauthorized person is to approach you.
04Nm 18:5 "Take care of the sanctuary and the services of the altar so that there won't be any more wrath on the Israelites. 
04Nm 18:6 Notice that I've taken your brothers, the Levites, from among the Israelites, giving them to you as a gift from the Lord to perform the service of the tent of meeting. 
04Nm 18:7 Now you and your sons with you are to maintain your priestly duties and all matters that concern the altar and what is housed within the veil. You are to perform these service. I'm giving you the priesthood as a gift of service, but any unauthorized person who approaches is to be put to death."
04Nm 18:8 Then the Lord told Aaron, "Look! I am indeed placing you in charge of my raised offerings and the holy things concerning the Israelites. Because of your anointing, I'm giving you and your sons a prescribed portion forever.
04Nm 18:9 "This is what is to belong to you from consecrated offerings spared from the fire£º all of their offerings, grain offerings, sin offerings, and trespass offerings that they render to me. They're to be considered most sacred to you and your sons. 
04Nm 18:10 You may eat them as consecrated gifts. Every male may eat them. They're sacred for you.
04Nm 18:11 "The raised offering and wave offerings presented by the Israelites are yours, too. I've given them to you, to your sons, and to your daughters as a prescribed apportionment forever. Everyone who is clean in your household may eat it. 
04Nm 18:12 All the best oil, wine, grain, and first fruits that they give to the Lord are to belong to you. Everyone who is clean in your household may eat it.
04Nm 18:13 "The first ripe fruits of every thing that the land produces and that they bring to the Lord are yours, too. Everyone who is clean in your household may eat it.
04Nm 18:14 "Every devoted thing in Israel is yours, too. 
04Nm 18:15 Everything that opens the womb, any living thing that they bring to the Lord - whether from human beings or animals - are for you. Just be sure that you redeem the first born of people and the first born of unclean animals.
04Nm 18:16 "Those that can be redeemed, you are to redeem at the age of one month, based on your estimate - for five shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, that is, for 20 gerahs. 
04Nm 18:17 But you are not to redeem the first born of a cow, sheep, or a female goat. They are holy. You are to sprinkle their blood on the altar and burn their fat for an offering made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the Lord.
04Nm 18:18 "Their meat is to belong to you, just as the breast wave offering and the right thigh is yours. 
04Nm 18:19 I'm giving you, your sons, and your daughters as a prescribed portion forever all the raised offerings of the consecrated things that the Israelites offer to the Lord. It's a salt covenant forever before the Lord with you and your descendants with you."
04Nm 18:20 "Then the Lord instructed Aaron, "You are not to have any inheritance in the land, nor are you to have any portion among the people. I am your portion and your inheritance among the Israelites. 
04Nm 18:21 As to the descendants of Levi, certainly I've given all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for their services that they perform at the tent of meeting. 
04Nm 18:22 Therefore the Israelites need no longer come to the tent of meeting, so they won't suffer the consequences of their sin and die. 
04Nm 18:23 The Levites are to perform the service of the tent of meeting and they are to bear their iniquity. This is to be a statute forever, throughout your generations, that they are not to receive an inheritance among the Israelites, 
04Nm 18:24 because I've given to the Levites the tithes that the Israelites bring to the Lord as raised offering. Therefore I told them that, unlike the Israelites, they won't receive an inheritance."1823
04Nm 18:25 Then the Lord instructed Moses, 
04Nm 18:26 Tell the Levites that when they receive tithes from the Israelites the tithes that I've given you from them as an inheritance, you are to offer a tenth of it it as a raised offering for the Lord. 
04Nm 18:27 Your raised offerings are to be accounted for you as though it were grain from threshing floors and full produce from wine vats.
04Nm 18:28 "You are to offer a raised offering to the Lord from all your tithes that you receive from the Israelites. Give Aaron the priest the raised offering of the Lord 
04Nm 18:29 out of all the most consecrated offerings that you receive, that is, all the raised offerings of the Lord, with all its best and the most holy parts of it. 
04Nm 18:30 Tell them that when they bring the best from it, as far as the Levites are concerned it is to be considered like produce from the threshing floors and wine vats. 
04Nm 18:31 You and your household may eat it anywhere, because it's a reward to you in return for your services at the tent of meeting. 
04Nm 18:32 You won't sin by offering the best of it, and you are not to profane the sacred things of the Israelites, so that you won't die."
04Nm 19:1 The Lord told Moses and Aaron, 
04Nm 19:2 "This is the ordinance of the law that the Lord commanded that the Israelites be told£º They are to bring you a spotless red heifer, without physical defect, that has never been fitted with a yoke. 
04Nm 19:3 They are to deliver it to Eleazar the priest, and it is to be brought outside the camp and slaughtered in his presence.
04Nm 19:4 "Then Eleazar the priest is to take blood from it with his finger and sprinkle the blood in front of the tent of meeting. 
04Nm 19:5 The entire heifer is to be incinerated in his presence, including its skin, its flesh, its blood, and its dung. 
04Nm 19:6 Then the priest is to take some cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet material and throw it into the middle of the burning heifer. 
04Nm 19:7 The priest is to wash his clothes and bathe himself with water, after which he may enter the camp, but he is to remain unclean until evening.
04Nm 19:8 "Whoever takes part in the burning is to wash his clothes and bathe himself in water and is to remain unclean until the evening.
04Nm 19:9 "Then someone who is unclean is to gather the ashes of the heifer and lay them outside the camp in a clean place. This is to be done for the community of Israel to use for water of purification from sin. 
04Nm 19:10 "Whoever gathers the ashes of the heifer is to wash his clothes and is to remain unclean until the evening. "This ordinance is to remain for the benefit of both the Israelites and the resident aliens who live among them."
04Nm 19:11 "Whoever comes in contact with the body of a dead person is to remain unclean for seven days. 
04Nm 19:12 He is to purify himself on the third day and he will be clean on the seventh day. But if he can't purify himself on the third day then he can't be clean on the seventh day.
04Nm 19:13 "Anyone who comes in contact with a dead person, that is, with the corpse of a human being who has died, but who does not purify himself, defiles the Lord's tabernacle. That person is to be eliminated from Israel, because the water of impurity wasn't sprinkled on him. He remains unclean and his uncleanness will remain with him. 
04Nm 19:14 This is the procedure to follow when a man dies in his tent. Every one who enters the tent and every one in it is to remain unclean for seven days. 
04Nm 19:15 Every open vessel that has no covering fastened around it is to be considered unclean.
04Nm 19:16 "Whoever is out in an open field and touches the body of someone who was killed by a sword, or a dead body, or someone's bones, or a grave, he is to be considered unclean for seven days.
04Nm 19:17 Now as for the unclean, they are to take ashes from the burning sin offering, and pour running water on it inside a vessel. 
04Nm 19:18 A clean person is to take some hyssop, dip it in water, and then sprinkle it on the tent, on every vessel, and on whoever was there; that is, on whoever touched the bones, the killed person, or the dead body, including whoever dug the grave.
04Nm 19:19 "And the clean person is to sprinkle the unclean person on the third day and seventh day and then he is to purify himself on the seventh day, wash his clothes, and bathe with water. He is to be considered clean at evening.
04Nm 19:20 "The person who is unclean but who doesn't purify himself is to be eliminated from contact with the assembly, since he has defiled the Lord's  sanctuary and the water of impurity wasn't sprinkled on him. He is to be considered unclean 
04Nm 19:21 as a continuing reminder to them.192"Whoever sprinkles the water of impurity is to wash his clothes, and whoever comes in contact with the water of impurity is to remain unclean until evening. 
04Nm 19:22 Furthermore, anything that the unclean person touches is to be considered unclean and the person who touches him is to be considered unclean until the evening. 
04Nm 20:1 The entire community of the Israelites entered the Zin wilderness during the first month. The people stayed in Kadesh. Miriam died and was buried there.
04Nm 20:2 But there was no water for the community, so they gathered together against Moses and Aaron. 
04Nm 20:3 As the people argued with Moses, they told him, "We wish that we had died when our relatives died in the Lord's presence! 
04Nm 20:4 Why did you bring the assembly of the Lord into this wilderness -  So we and our cattle could die here -  
04Nm 20:5 Why did you take us out of Egypt and bring us to this terrible place -  There's no place to plant seeds, fig trees, vines, or pomegranates! And there's no water to drink!"
04Nm 20:6 Then Moses and Aaron went into the presence of the community at the entrance of the tent of meeting and fell on their faces. Then the glory of the Lord appeared to them.
04Nm 20:7 The Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 20:8 "Take the rod, gather the community together, and then you and your brother Aaron are to speak to the rock right before their eyes. It will release water. As you bring water to them from the rock, the community and the cattle will be able to drink. 
04Nm 20:9 So Moses took the rod in the Lord's presence, just as he had commanded.
04Nm 20:10 Then Moses and Aaron gathered the community together in front of the rock. "Pay attention, you rebels!" Moses told them. "Are we to bring you water from this rock?"
04Nm 20:11 Then Moses raised his hand and struck the rock twice with his rod. Lots of water gushed out, and both the community and their cattle were able to drink.
04Nm 20:12 But the Lord rebuked Moses and Aaron, telling Moses£º "Because you both didn't believe me, because you didn't consecrate me as holy in the presence of the Israelites, you won't be the ones to bring this congregation into the land that I'm about to give them. 
04Nm 20:13 Because the Israelites argued with the Lord and he was set apart among them, this place was called the Meribah Springs.
04Nm 20:14 Later, Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom with this message£º "This is you're your relative Israel says£º 'You know all the hardships we've encountered. 
04Nm 20:15 Our ancestors went down to Egypt, where we lived for many years. But the Egyptians treated us and our ancestors viciously. 
04Nm 20:16 Then we cried to the Lord and he heard our voice, sending us a messenger who brought us out of Egypt. "'Now look! We've arrived in Kadesh, a city at the extreme end of your territory. 
04Nm 20:17 Permit us now to pass through your land. We won't pass through your fields or vineyards, and we won't drink waters from your wells. We'll keep to the King's Highway without turning either right or left until we have passed through your territory."
04Nm 20:18 But Edom replied, "You are not to pass through my land. If you do, I'll come out and start a war with you."
04Nm 20:19 Then the Israelites replied, "Permit us to travel on the highway. If we and our cattle drink your water, we'll pay the price you ask. Only please let us walk through, and nothing more." 
04Nm 20:20 But still he replied. "No. You're not to pass through." Then Edom went out to meet Moses with a vast army and a lot of military might. 
04Nm 20:21 That's how Edom refused Israel passage through their territory. So Israel turned away from there.
04Nm 20:22 They traveled from Kadesh, and then the entire community of the Israelites arrived at Mount Hor. 
04Nm 20:23 Then the Lord told Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, near the territory of Edom, 
04Nm 20:24 "Aaron is to be gathered to his people, since he is not to enter the land that I'm about to give the Israelites. After all, you both rebelled against my command at the Meribah Springs. 
04Nm 20:25 So take Aaron and his son Eleazar and ascend Mount Hor. 
04Nm 20:26 Remove Aaron's vestments and place them on his son Eleazar, because Aaron is to be gathered to his people and die there."
04Nm 20:27 So Moses did just what the Lord had commanded. They ascended Mount Hor right in front of the entire community. 
04Nm 20:28 As Moses was stripping Aaron's garments from him and clothing Aaron's son Eleazar with them, Aaron died there on top of the mountain. Afterwards, Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 
04Nm 20:29 When the entire community saw that Aaron had died, they mourned in memory of Aaron for 30 days.20
04Nm 21:1 When the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev, heard that Israel was coming along the Atharim caravan route, he fought against Israel and took some of them captive.
04Nm 21:2 Then Israel made this vow in the Lord's presence£º "If you give these people into our control, we intend to devote their cities to total destruction."
04Nm 21:3 When the Lord heard what Israel had decided to do, he delivered the Canaanites to them, and Israel exterminated them and their cities. They named the place Hormah.
04Nm 21:4 After this, they traveled from Mount Hor along the caravan route by way of the Sea of Reeds and went around the land of Edom. But when the people got impatient because it was a long route, 
04Nm 21:5 the people complained against the Lord and Moses. "Why did you bring us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?" they asked. "There's no food and water, and we're tired of this worthless bread."
04Nm 21:6 In response, the Lord sent poisonous serpents among the people to bite them. As a result, many of people of Israel died.
04Nm 21:7 Then the people approached Moses and admitted, "We've sinned by speaking against the Lord and you. Pray to the Lord, that he'll remove the serpents from us." So Moses prayed in behalf of the people.
04Nm 21:8 Then the Lord instructed Moses, "Make a poisonous serpent out of brass and fasten it to a pole. Anyone who has been bitten looks at it will live. 
04Nm 21:9 So Moses made a bronze serpent and fastened it to a pole. If a poisonous serpent bit a person and he looked at it, he lived.
04Nm 21:10 After this, the Israelites traveled and encamped at Oboth. 
04Nm 21:11 Then they traveled from Oboth and encamped at Iye Abarim, in the wilderness which is in the vicinity of Moab's eastern border. 
04Nm 21:12 From there, they traveled and encamped in the valley of Zered. 
04Nm 21:13 Then from there they traveled to the other side of Arnon and camped in the wilderness that borders the territory of the Amorites. (Arnon borders Moab between Moab and the Amorites, 
04Nm 21:14 which is why the book of the Wars of the Lord reads, "Waheb and Suphah and the wadis of the Arnon, 
04Nm 21:15 and the slope of the valleys, that extends to the dwelling places of Ar and the borders of Moab."
04Nm 21:16 From there they traveled to the Well of Beer, where the Lord had said instructed Moses, "Gather the people together and I'll give you water. 
04Nm 21:17 That's also where Israel sang this song£º Rise up, well! Sing to it!
04Nm 21:18 It's the well that the leaders dug, the one carved out by the nobles of the people with their scepters and staffs. Then the moved on in the wilderness from there to Mattanah, 
04Nm 21:19 then from Mattanah to Nahaliel, from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 
04Nm 21:20 and from Bamoth to the valley of Moab where their fields are, and from there to the top of Mount Pisgah, that looks down toward the open desert.
04Nm 21:21 Later, Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who conveyed this request£º 
04Nm 21:22 "Permit us to pass through your land. We won't trespass in your fields or vineyards. We won't drink water from any well, and we'll only travel along the King's Highway until we've passed through your territory."
04Nm 21:23 Instead of letting Israel pass through his territory, Sihon mustered his entire army and marched out to meet them in the wilderness. He arrived at Jahaz and attacked Israel. 
04Nm 21:24 But Israel defeated him in battle and took possession of all his lands from Arnon to Jabbok, including the Ammonites, even though the border of the Ammonites was strong. 
04Nm 21:25 So Israel captured all of those cities, occupied all the Amorite cities in Heshbon, and all its towns. 
04Nm 21:26 Heshbon was the capital city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who fought against the previous king of Moab and captured all his land from his capital city to Arnon. 
04Nm 21:27 Therefore the ones who speak in proverbs say£º Come to Heshbon and let it be built! Let the city of Sihon be established!
04Nm 21:28 A a fire has gone out from Heshbon, And a flame from the city of Sihon. It consumed Ar of Moab and the lords of the high places who lived in Arnon. 
04Nm 21:29 Woe to you, Moab! You are destroyed, you people of Chemosh! He has given up his sons as fugitives and his daughters have gone into captivity to Sihon, king of the Amorites.
04Nm 21:30 We've fired at them. Heshbon has perished as far as Dibon. We've destroyed them as far as Nophah even as far as Medeba. 
04Nm 21:31 So Israel lived in Amorite territory.
04Nm 21:32 Then Moses sent out explorers to scout Jazer. They captured its towns and drove out the Amorites who were there. 
04Nm 21:33 Then they turned toward Bashan. However, Og, the king of Bashan mustered his army and went out to attack them at Edrei.
04Nm 21:34 The Lord told Moses, "You are not to fear him, because I'm going to deliver him, his entire army, and his land into your control. Do to him just what you've done to Sihon, king of the Amorites, who used to live in Heshbon."
04Nm 21:35 So they attacked him, his sons, and his entire army, until there wasn't even a single survivor left. Then they took possession of his land. 
04Nm 22:1 The Israelites continued their travels, eventually encamping on the plains of Moab beside the Jordan River opposite Jericho. 
04Nm 22:2 Zippor's son Balak saw everything that Israel had done to the Amorites. 
04Nm 22:3 As a result, Moab greatly feared the people, because they were so numerous. Because a sense of impending doom was afflicting the Moabites as they faced the Israelites, 
04Nm 22:4 the Moabites said to the elders of Midian, "This horde of people is about to lick up everything around us, like an ox licks up the green ground." At that time, Zippor's son Balak was the king of Moab. 
04Nm 22:5 He sent messengers to Beor's son Balaam in Pethor, near the Jordan River, the land where the descendants of his people originated, to summon his aid. He said, "Look! A group of people have escaped from Egypt. They cover the surface of the whole earth, and are sitting here right in front of me. 
04Nm 22:6 So come right now and curse this people for me, because there are too many of them for me to handle. Perhaps I'll be able to strike them down and drive them out of the land, since I know that whomever you bless is blessed and whomever you curse is cursed."
04Nm 22:7 So the elders of Moab and Midian left to visit Balaam, bringing an honorarium with them, and communicated Balak's concerns to him.
04Nm 22:8 In answer, Balaam told them, "Stay here for the night and I'll bring back a message to you, depending on what the Lord says to me." So the officers of Moab stayed with Balaam overnight.
04Nm 22:9 God visited Balaam and asked him, "Who are these men with you?"
04Nm 22:10 Then Balaam said to God£º Zippor's son Balak, king of Moab, sent them to me and said, 
04Nm 22:11 "Look! A group of people have escaped from Egypt. They cover the surface of the whole earth! So come right now and curse them for me. Perhaps I'll be able to fight against them and drive them out."
04Nm 22:12 But God said to Balaam, "Don't go with them. Don't curse the people, because they're blessed."
04Nm 22:13 So Balaam got up the next morning and told Balak's officials, "Go back to your homeland, because the Lord has refused me permission to go with you."
04Nm 22:14 So Balak's officials  got up, returned to Balak and reported, "Balaam refused to come with us."
04Nm 22:15 In response, Balak sent more officers - higher ranking ones, at that! -  
04Nm 22:16 who approached Balaam with this message£º "This is what Zippor's son Balak says£º 'Don't let anything get in the way of your coming to me. 
04Nm 22:17 I'm determined to reward you generously, and I'll do  everything you tell me to do. So come right away and and curse this people for me."
04Nm 22:18 Balaam responded to Balak's entourage by saying, "Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I won't doublecross the command of the Lord my God in even the slightest way. 
04Nm 22:19 Meanwhile, stay here overnight so I may learn what the Lord might say to me."
04Nm 22:20 God came to visit Balaam that same night and told him, "If the men come to call on you, get up and go with them, but be sure to do only what I tell you to do." 
04Nm 22:21 The next morning, Balaam got up, saddled his donkey, and started to leave, accompanied by the Moabite officials.
04Nm 22:22 At this, the anger of the Lord flared up against Balaam, because he was leaving. So the angel of the Lord stood in the way to oppose him. As Balaam was riding his donkey, accompanied by two of his servants, 
04Nm 22:23 all of a sudden the donkey saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with an unsheathed sword in his hand! The donkey turned off the road and went into an open field. Balaam started beating the donkey in order to turn her back to the road, 
04Nm 22:24 but the angel of the Lord stood on a narrow path that crossed the vineyards. It had walls on both sides of the path. 
04Nm 22:25 When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, she squeezed herself so close to the wall that Balaam's foot was pressed to the wall. So he beat her again!
04Nm 22:26 Then the angel of the Lord went along a little further and stood in a much narrower space, where it was impossible to turn either right or left. 
04Nm 22:27 When the donkey saw the angel of the Lord, she crouched down under Balaam. As a result, Balaam got so angry that he started to whip the donkey with his staff.22
04Nm 22:28 That's when the Lord enabled the donkey to speak. She asked Balaam, "What did I do to you that you would beat me in the space of only three footsteps?"
04Nm 22:29 "Because you're playing a dirty trick on me," Balaam answered the donkey. "If only I had a sword in my hand! I'd kill you right now!"
04Nm 22:30 But in response, the donkey asked Balaam, "I'm your donkey that you've ridden on in the past without incident, am I not, and I'm the same donkey you're riding on right now, am I not -  Am I in the habit of treating you like this?" "No," he admitted.
04Nm 22:31 Then the Lord enabled Balaam to see, so he observed the angel of the Lord standing in the way, with an unsheathed sword in his hand. So he bowed down and prostrated himself on his face.
04Nm 22:32 Then the angel of the Lord asked him, "Why did you beat your donkey in the space of only three footsteps -  I've come to oppose you, because I say that what you're doing is perverted. 
04Nm 22:33 The donkey saw me and turned in front of me in the space of those three footsteps. 
04Nm 22:34 If she hadn't turn away from me, I would have killed you by now and left her alive!" At this, Balaam replied to the angel of the Lord, "I've sinned! I didn't know that you were standing to meet me on the road. So now, since it displeases you, let me go back."
04Nm 22:35 But the angel of the Lord told Balaam, "Go with the men, but deliver only the message that I'm going to give you." So Balaam went with Balak's officials.
04Nm 22:36 When Balak heard that Balaam had arrived, he went out to meet him in the city of Moab on the border of Arnon at the extreme end of his territory. 
04Nm 22:37 Balak asked Balaam, "Didn't I repeatedly send for you to summon you -  Why didn't you come to me -  I can pay you well, can't I?"
04Nm 22:38 Balaam answered Balak, "Well, I'm here now. I've come to you, but I can't just say anything, can I -  I'll speak only what God puts in my mouth to say."
04Nm 22:39 So accompanied by Balaam and Balak's officials, Balak traveled to Kiriath-huzoth, 
04Nm 22:40 where he sacrificed oxen and sheep.
04Nm 22:41 The next day, Balak brought Balaam up to Bamoth-baal, where he could see part of the community of Israel. 
04Nm 23:1 Balaam told Balak, "Build for me here seven altars and prepare here for me seven bulls and seven rams.
04Nm 23:2 So Balak did just as Balaam instructed. Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
04Nm 23:3 Then Balaam instructed Balak, "Stand by your offering and leave me alone by myself. Perhaps the Lord will come to meet me. I'll tell you whatever he reveals to me." And so he went to a high place, 
04Nm 23:4 where the Lord met with Balaam, who told to him, "I've prepared seven altars and offered bulls and rams on an altar."
04Nm 23:5 Then the Lord gave Balaam this message. "Return to Balak and speak to him."
04Nm 23:6 So Balaam returned to where Balaak had been standing, that is, next to his offerings, accompanied by all the Moabite officials.
04Nm 23:7 Then Balaam uttered this prophetic statement£º "King Balak of Moab brought me from Aram, from the eastern mountains, and told me, 'Come and curse Jacob for me. Come and curse Israel.'
04Nm 23:8 But how can I curse those whom God hasn't cursed -  How can I denounce those whom the Lord has not denounced - 
04Nm 23:9 I saw them from the top of the rocks. I watched them from the hills Truly this is a people that lives by itself and doesn't matter among the nations.
04Nm 23:10 Who can count the dust of Jacob -  Who can number the dust of Israel -  Let me die the death of the righteous, and may I end up like him."
04Nm 23:11 "What are you doing to me?" Balak asked Balaam. "I brought you to curse my enemies, not pronounce a blessing!"
04Nm 23:12 But in response, Balaam asked, "Shouldn't I be careful to communicate only what the Lord puts in my mouth?"
04Nm 23:13 "Come with me to another place where you can see them," Balak replied. "You'll only see a portion of them, because you won't be able to see them completely. Come and curse them from there for me."
04Nm 23:14 So Balak took him to the field of Zophim, and from there to the top of Mount Pisgah, where he built seven altars and then offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 
04Nm 23:15 Then he said to Balak, "Stand by your offering while I go alone to meet the Lord."14
04Nm 23:16 Then the Lord met with Balaam and gave a message to him. "Now go back to Balak and speak to him." 
04Nm 23:17 So Balaam returned to where Balak had been standing, that is, next to his offerings, accompanied by the Moabite officials. "What did the Lord say?" Balak asked him.
04Nm 23:18 In response, Balaam uttered this prophetic statement:23 "Stand up, Balak, and pay attention! Listen to me, you son of Zippor!
04Nm 23:19 God is not a human male - he doesn't lie, nor is he a human being - he never vacilates. Once he speaks up, He's going to act, won't he -  Once he makes a promise, He'll fulfill it, won't he - 
04Nm 23:20 Look! I've received a blessing, and so I will bless. I won't withdraw it.
04Nm 23:21 He has not responded to iniquity in Jacob or gazed at mischief in Israel. The Lord his God is with them, And the triumphant cry of a king is among them.
04Nm 23:22 From Egypt God brought them - his strength was like a wild ox!
04Nm 23:23 No Satanic plan against Jacob nor divination against Israel can ever prevail. When the time is right, it shall be asked about Jacob and Israel, 'What has God accomplished?'
04Nm 23:24 Look! The people are like a lions. Like the lion, he rises up! He does not lie down again until he has consumed his prey and drunk the blood of the slain."
04Nm 23:25 Then Balak said to Balaam, "Don't curse them or bless them!"
04Nm 23:26 Didn't I tell you," Balaam responded to Balak, "that I'll say whatever that the Lord tells me to say?"
04Nm 23:27 So Balak exhorted Balaam, "Let's go right now! I'll take you to another place. Maybe God will  agree to have you a curse from there for me." 
04Nm 23:28 So Balak took Balaam to the top of Mount Peor, which overlooks the open wilderness.
04Nm 23:29 Balaam told Balak, "Build seven altars for me right here. Then prepare seven bulls and seven rams." 
04Nm 23:30 Balak did just what Balaam had instructed  - he offered a bull and a ram on each altar.
04Nm 24:1 When Balaam noticed that the Lord was pleased that Balaam was blessing Israel, he didn't behave as he had time after time before, that is, to practice divination. Instead, he turned with his face to the wilderness, 
04Nm 24:2 looked up, and saw Israel encamped in their respective tribal order. Just then, the spirit of God came upon him. 
04Nm 24:3 Balaam uttered this prophetic statement£º "A declaration by Beor's son Balaam, a declaration by the strong, blind man.
04Nm 24:4  A declaration from one who hears what God has to say, who saw the vision that the Almighty revealed, who keeps stumbling, with open eyes.
04Nm 24:5  Jacob, your tents are so fine, as well as your dwelling places, Israel!
04Nm 24:6  They're spread out ike valleys, like gardens along river banks, like aloe planted by the Lord, or like cedars beside water.
04Nm 24:7  He will pour water from his buckets; and his descendants will stream forth like abundant water. His king will be more exalted than Agag when he exalts his own kingdom.
04Nm 24:8  God is bringing them out of Egypt, with the strength of an ox. He'll devour enemy nations, break their bones, and impale them with arrows.
04Nm 24:9  He crouches, laying low like a lion. Who would awaken him -  Those who bless you are blessed, and those who curse you are cursed. 
04Nm 24:10 Balak flew into a rage and he started hitting his fists together. "I called you to curse my enemies," he yelled at Balaam. "But look here! You've blessed them three times! 
04Nm 24:11 Now get out of here! I had promised you that I would definitely honor you, but now the Lord has kept me from doing that!"
04Nm 24:12 But Balaam asked Balak, "I told your messengers, 
04Nm 24:13 'Even if Balak gives me his palace full of silver and gold, I won't doublecross the command of the Lord and do anything - where good or evil - on my own initiative, because I'm going to say whatever the Lord says.' 
04Nm 24:14 Meanwhile, since I have to return to my people, come and listen while I tell you what this people will be doing to your people in the last days."13
04Nm 24:15 Then Balaam uttered this prophetic statement£º "The declaration by Beor's son Balaam, a declaration by the strong, blind man.
04Nm 24:16  A declaration from one who hears what God has to say, who knows what the Most High knows, who saw the vision that the Almighty revealed, who keeps stumbling with open eyes.
04Nm 24:17  I can see him, but not right now. I observe him, but from a distance. A star streams forth from Jacob; a scepter arises from Israel. He will crush Moab's forehead, along with all of Seth's descendants.24
04Nm 24:18  Edom will be a conquered nation and Seir will be Israel's defeated foe, while Israel performs valiantly.
04Nm 24:19 He will rule over Jacob, annihilating those who survive in the city.
04Nm 24:20 Next, Balaam looked directly at Amalek and then uttered this prophetic statement£º Even though Amalek is an international leader, his future is permanent destruction.
04Nm 24:21 Balaam also uttered this prophetic statement about the Kenites£º Your dwelling places are stable, because your nest is carved in solid rock.
04Nm 24:22 Nevertheless, Kain will be incinerated. How long will it take until Asshur takes you hostage - 
04Nm 24:23 Finally, he uttered this prophetic statement£º "Ah, who can live, unless God makes it happen - 
04Nm 24:24 Ships under control of Kittim will devastate Asshur and Eber, until they are permanently destroyed.
04Nm 24:25 Then Balaam got up, returned to his country, and Balak went on his way.
04Nm 25:1 While Israel remained encamped in Shittim, the people began to commit sexual immorality with Moabite women, 
04Nm 25:2 who also invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods. So the people ate and worshipped their gods.
04Nm 25:3 The people joined the Baal-Peor cult. As a result, the anger of the Lord flared up against Israel, 
04Nm 25:4 so the Lord told Moses, "Take all the leaders of the people and execute them in broad daylight for the Lord, so the Lord's burning anger may be withdrawn from Israel."
04Nm 25:5 Then Moses ordereed the judges of Israel, "Each one of you is to execute the men in his own tribe who joined the Baal-Peor cult."
04Nm 25:6 That very moment, one of the Israelites arrived, bringing to his brothers one of the Midianite women, right in front of Moses and the entire community of Israel, while they were weeping at the entrance of the tent of meeting! 
04Nm 25:7 When Eleazar's son Phinehas, grandson of Aaron the priest saw this, he jumped up from the middle of the community, grabbged a javelin in his hand, 
04Nm 25:8 followed the Israelite man inside his tent and impaled the two of them - the Israel man and the woman - right through both of them and into her abdomen. Then the plague infecting the Israelites was brought to a halt. Nevertheless,- 24,000 people died because of the plague.
04Nm 25:10 The Lord told Moses. 
04Nm 25:11 "Eleazar's son Phinehas, grandson of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from Israel. Because his zealousness reflected my own zeal for them, I didn't consume Israel in my jealousy. 
04Nm 25:12 Therefore, I'm certainly going to be giving him my covenant of peace, 
04Nm 25:13 for him and for his descendants after him, too, a covenant of perpetual priesthood, because he was zealous for his God and made atonement for the Israelites."
04Nm 25:14 Now the name of the Israelite man who was slain, along with the Midianite woman, was Salu's son Zimri, a leader from the tribe of Simeon. 
04Nm 25:15 The name of the woman who was slain, that is, the Midianite woman, was named Cozbi. She was the daughter of Zur, a leader of one of the ancestral houses of Midian.
04Nm 25:16 Later, the Lord ordered Moses, 
04Nm 25:17 "Attack the Midianites and execute them, 
04Nm 25:18 because they've acted deceitfully, bringing trouble to you when in this incident at Peor with Cozbi, daughter of a Midian prince, who was killed during the plague that came about because of the incident at Peor."
04Nm 26:1 After the plague was over, the Lord told Moses and Aaron the priest's son Eleazar, 
04Nm 26:2 "Take a census of the entire community of Israel from the age of 20 twenty years and above, according to each ancestral tribe, counting everyone who is able to go out to war in Israel." 1
04Nm 26:3 Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke to them in the plains of Moab, by the Jordan River in Jericho. 
04Nm 26:4 They counted every male Israelite who had come out of Egypt and who was 20 years old and above, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
04Nm 26:5 From Reuben, Israel's first born, the Reubenites included from Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; from Pallu, the family of the Palluites; 
04Nm 26:6 from Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; and from Carmi, the family of the Carmites. 
04Nm 26:7 These families of the Reubenites numbered 43,733.6
04Nm 26:8 Now Pallu's son was Eliab. 
04Nm 26:9 The descendants of Eliab were Nemuel, Dathan, and Abiram. Dathan and Abiram were removed from the community because they joined the rebellion against Moses and Aaron, as did Korah's company when they rebelled against the Lord. 
04Nm 26:10 The ground had opened its mouth and swallowed them up, along with Korah. Also, that group died when the fire devoured 250 men as a warning sign, 
04Nm 26:11 But Korah's direct descendants didn't die.2610

04Nm 26:33 Hepher's son Zelophehad Hepher had no sons, but the names of Zelophehad's daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
04Nm 26:34 These families of Manasseh numbered 52,700.

04Nm 26:41 These descendants of Benjamin's families numbered 45,600.
04Nm 26:42 The tribe of Dan, listed according to their families, included the families of the Shuhamites from Shuham.

04Nm 26:45 The descendants of Beriah included£º From Heber, the family of the Heberites; from Malchiel, the family of the Malchielites. 
04Nm 26:46 (The name of Asher's daughter was Serah.) 
04Nm 26:47 These descendants of Asher numbered 53,400.
04Nm 26:48 The tribe of Naphtali, listed according to their families, included£º From Jahzeel, the family of the Jahzeelites; from Guni, the family of the Gunites; 
04Nm 26:49 fom Jezer, the family of the Jezerites; from Shillem, the family of the Shillemites. 
04Nm 26:50 These families of Naphtali numbered 45,400.
04Nm 26:51 The total of those numbered among Israelites was 601,730.
04Nm 26:52 Then the Lord told Moses. 
04Nm 26:53 "The land is to be divided for an inheritance according to the total number of these names. 
04Nm 26:54 The more there are in number, you are to increase their inheritance, and the less there are in number, you are to decrease their inheritance. You are to provide an inheritance to each based on the size of their family, 
04Nm 26:55 but the land is to be divided by lot, inheriting according to the names of their ancestor's tribe. 
04Nm 26:56 Depending on the lot, the portion of their inheritance is to be divided between those with more members and those with lesser members." 53
04Nm 26:57 Those who were numbered from the Levites, listed according to their families, included£º From Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; from Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; and from Merari, the family of the Merarites. 
04Nm 26:58 These were the families of Levi£º The family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, and the family of the Korahites.7Now Kohath had a son Amram. 
04Nm 26:59 Amram's wife was Levi's daughter Jochebed, who was born to Levi in Egypt. Amram gave birth to Aaron, Moses, and their sister Miriam.26
04Nm 26:60 To Aaron were born Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 
04Nm 26:61 But Nadab and Abihu died when they offered unauthorized fire in the Lord's presence. 
04Nm 26:62 All of those individuals numbered 23,000. No male from the age of a month and above was numbered among the Israelites because no inheritance was to be assigned to them among the Israelites.
04Nm 26:63 So this has been a list of those were the ones who were registered by Moses and Eleazar the priest when they numbered the Israelites in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho. 
04Nm 26:6 4But none of these men among these numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest when they numbered the Israelites in wilderness of Sinai , survived to enter the land, 
04Nm 26:65 because the Lord had said about them, "They'll certainly die in the wilderness. No man will survive from them except Jephunneh's son Caleb and Nun's son Joshua."
04Nm 27:1 Now the daughters of Hepher's son Zelophehad, Gilead's grandson, who had been fathered by Machir, who had been fathered by Manasseh, from the tribe of Manasseh the direct son of Joseph, were named Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. They approached 
04Nm 27:2 and Moses, Eleazar the priest, the elders, and the entire community at the entrance of the tent of meeting, stood before them, and said, 
04Nm 27:3 "Our father died in the wilderness, but he wasn't with the company of those who gathered against the Lord along with the company of Korah. He died in his own sin, and he had no sons. 
04Nm 27:4 Why are you going to eliminate the name of our father from his family, just because he had no son -  Give us a possession from among our father's relatives."
04Nm 27:5 So Moses brought the family into the Lord's presence, 
04Nm 27:6 and the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 27:7 "The daughters of Zelophehad are telling the truth. You are certainly, to give to them a possession for an inheritance among their father's relatives. You are to pass on the inheritance of their father to them. 
04Nm 27:8 Tell the Israelite that when a man dies without a son, you are to pass his inheritance to his daughter. 
04Nm 27:9 If he doesn't have a daughter, give his inheritance to his brothers. 
04Nm 27:10 If he doesn't have brothers, give his inheritance to his father's brothers. 
04Nm 27:11 If his father doesn't have brothers, then give his inheritance to a relative who is nearest to him from the family and he'll take possession of it. This is to be a permanent ordinance for the Israelites, just as the Lord commanded Moses."
04Nm 27:12 Then the Lord said to Moses, "You are climb these Abarim mountains and look over the land that I'm going to give the Israelites. 
04Nm 27:13 After you've seen it, you'll be taken to be with your people just as your brother Aaron was gathered to them, 
04Nm 27:14 because in the wilderness of Zin, when the community rebelled, you rebelled against my command to treat me as holy before their eyes in regards to the Meribah Springs in Kadesh in the wilderness of Zin."
04Nm 27:15 Moses responded to the Lord. 
04Nm 27:16 "May the Lord God of the spirits of all living creatures appoint a man over the community 
04Nm 27:17 who will go in and out before them, and who will lead them out and bring them in so that the Lord's community won't be like a flock without a shepherd."
04Nm 27:18 "Select Nun's son Joshua. The Spirit is in that man." the Lord answered Moses. "You are to lay your hand on him 
04Nm 27:19 and make him stand in front of Eleazar the priest and the entire community. Then you are to set him in charge right before their eyes, 
04Nm 27:20 turning over your authority to him so that the entire community of Israel knows to obey him.
04Nm 27:21 "You are to make him stand in the presence of Eleazar the priest, who is to inquire on his behalf using the Urim in the presence of the Lord regarding a decision of judgment, because by his command he and all the Israelites with him will go out or come in."
04Nm 27:22 So Moses did what the Lord had commanded him. He took Joshua, made him stand in the presence of Eleazar the priest and the entire community, 
04Nm 27:23 laid his hands on him, and charged him, just as the Lord had commanded, using Moses' authority.
04Nm 28:1 The Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 28:2 "You are to command the Israelites about my offerings that they are to be sure to bring edible offerings to me, presented by fire and a pleasing aroma to me, at their appointed time. 
04Nm 28:3 "Tell them that this is the offering, presented by fire that you are to offer to the Lord£º two one year old lambs, offered daily every day. 
04Nm 28:4 Offer the first lamb in the morning and the second toward the evening, 
04Nm 28:5 accompanied by one tenth of an ephah of fine flour for grain offering, mixed with one fourth of a hin of pure olive oil. 
04Nm 28:6 This burnt offering, which was prescribed at Mount Sinai, is to be offered every day as a pleasing aroma made by fire to the Lord.5
04Nm 28:7 "The drink offering is to be one fourth of a hin for each lamb. You are to pour out a drink offering of strong wine to the Lord in the holy place. 
04Nm 28:8 You are also to offer the second lamb toward the evening. Just like the morning sacrifice, you are to present the grain offering, accompanied by its corresponding drink offering, as a presentation made by fire, a pleasing aroma to the Lord."
04Nm 28:9 "Every Sabbath day, you are to offer two one year old lambs without any defects with two tenths of an ephah of fine flour for grain offering, mixed with olive oil, along with their corresponding drink offering. 
04Nm 28:10 This burnt offering is to be presented every Sabbath, apart from the continuous burnt offering, along with its corresponding drink offering."
04Nm 28:11 "On the first day of each month, you are to offer a burnt offering to the Lord consisting of two young bulls, one ram, and seven one year old lambs, all of them without any defects, 
04Nm 28:12 along with three tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with olive oil, for each bull, two tenths of an ephah of fine flour for a grain offering, mixed with olive oil, for the one ram, 
04Nm 28:13 one tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with olive oil as grain offering for each lamb. This burnt offering will be a pleasing aroma, incinerated as an offering to the Lord. 
04Nm 28:14 Their drink offerings are to be half a hin of wine for each bull, one third of a hin for the ram, and one fourth of a hin for each lamb. This burnt offering is to be presented each and every month throughout the year. 
04Nm 28:15 One goat is to be offered at regular intervals as a sin offering to the Lord, accompanied by its corresponding drink offering."
04Nm 28:16 "The Lord's Passover is to take place on the fourteenth day of the first month. 
04Nm 28:17 You are to hold a festival on the fifteenth day of this month for seven days, during which time unleavened bread is to be eaten."
04Nm 28:18 "On the first day, you are to hold a sacred assembly. No servile work is to be done. 
04Nm 28:19 Bring an offering that is to be incinerated in the Lord's presence, consisting of two young bulls, a ram, and seven one year old lambs, all without any defects, 
04Nm 28:20 along with their grain offering of fine flour mixed with olive oil. Offer three tenths of an ephah for each bull, two-tenths of an ephah for the ram, 
04Nm 28:21 and one tenth of an ephah for each of the seven lambs. 
04Nm 28:22 Then present one goat for a sin offering to make atonement for you, 
04Nm 28:23 apart from the burnt offering in the morning, which you are to continue offering.
04Nm 28:24 "Do this every day for seven days, as an edible sacrifice to the Lord made by fire, a pleasing aroma. It is to be offered apart from the continuous burnt offering and its corresponding drink offering. 
04Nm 28:25 On the seventh day you are to hold another sacred assembly for your benefit, on which no servile work is to be done."
04Nm 28:26 "On the first day of your harvest season, you are to hold a sacred assembly when you present your first fruits during the Feast of Weeks. No servile is to be done. 
04Nm 28:27 You are to offer this burnt-offering as a pleasing aroma to the Lord£º two young bulls, one ram, and seven one year old lambs,

04Nm 28:30 and one goat to make atonement for you. 
04Nm 28:31 Offer them in addition to the regular burnt offering, accompanied by its grain offering and its corresponding drink offerings."
04Nm 29:1 "You are to hold a sacred assembly on the first day of the seventh month of each year. No servile work is to be done. It's a day of blowing trumpets for you.
04Nm 29:2 "You are to bring these burnt offerings as a pleasing aroma to the Lord£º one year old young bull, one ram, and seven one year old lambs, all without any defects,

04Nm 29:7 "You are to hold a sacred assembly on the tenth day of this same seventh month. You are to humble yourselves, and no servile work is to be done.

04Nm 29:39 "Present these to the Lord at your appointed festival, in addition to your offerings in fulfillment of vows, free will offerings, burnt offerings, grain offerings, drink offerings, and peace offerings."
04Nm 29:40 Moses instructed the Israelites regarding everything that the Lord had commanded Moses.
04Nm 30:1 Later, Moses told the elders of the Israelite tribes, "This is what the Lord has commanded. 
04Nm 30:2 When a man makes a vow to the Lord, or swears an oath - an obligation that is binding to himself -  he is not to break his word. Instead, he is to fulfill whatever promise came out of his mouth."
04Nm 30:3 "When a young woman makes a vow to the Lord or pledges herself to an obligation while she still lives in her father's house, 
04Nm 30:4 and her father hears her vow and the obligations that she had pledged herself to fulfill, yet her father keeps silent about it, then all her vows and every obligation she pledged herself to are to stand.
04Nm 30:5 "But if her father disallows her on the same day that he hears what she has said, then all her vows and every obligation she had pledged herself to fulfill are not to stand. The Lord will forgive her, because her father has forbidden her."
04Nm 30:6 "If she has a husband and she makes a vow that is binding on herself, or if she makes a hasty vow with her mouth that she pledges herself to fulfill, 
04Nm 30:7 and husband hears her vow, yet remains silent on the day that he hears is, then her vows are to stand and the obligation to that she had pledged herself to fulfill is to stand. 
04Nm 30:8 But if, on the same day her husband hears, and he disallows her, then he has revoked her vows that she made for herself, along with any hasty vows that she spoke and to which she pledged herself to fulfill. The Lord will forgive her."30
04Nm 30:9 "Everything that a widow or a divorced woman pledges herself to fulfill are to be binding on her. 
04Nm 30:10 But if, while she had been living in her late or former husband's house, she makes a vow or a promise that binds her with an oath, 
04Nm 30:11 and her husband hears it but remains silent, not disallowing it, then all her vows are to stand, along with every obligation that she has pledged herself to fulfill.
04Nm 30:12 "But if her husband disallowed them the very day that he heard her, everything that she spoke relating to her vows and her obligation to herself are not to stand, because her husband had revoked them. The Lord will forgive her.
04Nm 30:13 "Her husband may confirm or revoke every vow and binding obligation that afflicts her. 
04Nm 30:14 But if her husband remains silent about her from day to day, then he has affirmed all her vows or obligations that she has obligated herself to fulfill. He has affirmed them because he remained silent from the day he heard her vows. 
04Nm 30:15 But if had nullified them after he had heard, then he will be responsible for any resulting iniquity."
04Nm 30:16 These are the statutes that the Lord commanded Moses concerning a man and his wife and concerning a father and his young daughter while she still lives in her father's house.
04Nm 31:1 Later, the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 31:2 "Be sure to exact vengeance on behalf of the Israelites from the Midianites, after which you'll be taken home to your people."
04Nm 31:3 SoMoses instructed the people, "Muster your men of war to attack the Midianites and deliver the Lord's vengeance against Midian. 
04Nm 31:4 Send 1,000 men to war from every tribe throughout all of Israel." 
04Nm 31:5 So 1,000 men from every tribe - 12,000 from the thousands of Israel - were mustered and equipped for war.
04Nm 31:6 Moses sent 1,000 men from every tribe to fight against them, along with Eleazar's son Phinehas, in whose hands were the articles of the sanctuary and trumpets to sound he battle alarms.
04Nm 31:7 They fought against the Midianites just as the Lord had commanded Moses, killing every man. 
04Nm 31:8 They executed the five kings of Midian, including Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba. They also executed Beor's son Balaam with a sword.
04Nm 31:9 After this, the Israelites took captive the Midianite women and children and confiscated as spoils of war all their cattle, livestock, and their goods. 
04Nm 31:10 They burned every town where they had lived and incinerated all of their encampments. 
04Nm 31:11 They took all the booty and plunder, including both humans and animals. 
04Nm 31:12 Then they brought the captives, booty, and plunder to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the entire community of Israel at the camp on the plains of Moab, by the Jordan River in Jericho. 
04Nm 31:13 Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the community went out to meet them outside the camp.
04Nm 31:14 But Moses became livid with anger at the officers of the army, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds who had returned from servicing in the battle. 
04Nm 31:15 "Did you keep all the women alive?" Moses asked them. 
04Nm 31:16 "Look! These women were the same ones who were counseled by Balaam to cause the Israelites to commit a grievous sin against the Lord at Peor. As a result, that plague infected the Lord's community. 
04Nm 31:17 You are to kill every male child and every woman who has had sexual relations with a man. 
04Nm 31:18 You are to allow the young women who haven't yet had sexual relations with a man to live for yourselves."17
04Nm 31:19 "Now you are to stay outside the camp for seven days, after which anyone who has killed a person or touched someone who was killed may purify yourselves on the third day and you and your captives will be pure on the seventh day. 
04Nm 31:20 Furthermore, you are to purify every garment, that is, everything made of leather, goat's hair, or containing wood."
04Nm 31:21 Eleazar the priest told soldiers who had gone to battle, "This is the ordinance of the law that the Lord commanded Moses 
04Nm 31:22 concerning anything containing gold, silver, brass, iron, tin, and lead, 
04Nm 31:23 or anything that can survive a refiner's fire£º You are to pass it through fire, after which it will be clean. Then it is to be purified with the water of impurity. Everything that cannot survive a refiner's fire is to be washed in water. 
04Nm 31:24 Wash your clothes on the seventh day, after which you will be clean. Then you may enter the camp."23
04Nm 31:25 Then the Lord said to Moses, 
04Nm 31:26 "Take an inventory of the booty that was taken in the battle, both of humans and of animals. You, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the fathers of the community, 
04Nm 31:27 are then to divide the booty between the warriors who went to war and the rest of the community.
04Nm 31:28 "After this, you are to exact a tribute for the Lord from the soldiers who went to war, consisting of the tribute earned by one person out of every 500, whether from people, cattle, asses, or flocks. 
04Nm 31:29 "You are to take half their share and give it to Eleazar the priest as a raised offering to the Lord.
04Nm 31:30 "Then take half the share of the Israelites, one drawn out of every fifty people, cattle, asses, flocks, and from every animal, then give to the Levites who maintain the service of the Lord's tabernacle."
04Nm 31:31 So Moses and Eleazar the priest did what the Lord had commanded Moses. 
04Nm 31:32 Now, the goods confiscated, in excess of the war implements that the warriors had gathered was 675,000 sheep, 
04Nm 31:33 72,000 cattle, 
04Nm 31:34 61,000 donkeys, and 
04Nm 31:35 32,000 women who had not had sexual relations with a man.
04Nm 31:36 Now half of the share of those who went to war numbered 337,500 sheep, 
04Nm 31:37 so the Lord's tribute from the sheep totaled 675.
04Nm 31:38 The cattle numbered 36,000 so the Lord's tribute totaled 72.
04Nm 31:39 The donkeys numbered 30,500 so the Lord's tribute totaled 61.
04Nm 31:40 The people numbered 16,000, and Lord's tribute totaled 32 people.
04Nm 31:41 Then Moses gave the tribute, a raised offering of the Lord, to Eleazar the priest, just as the Lord had commanded Moses. 
04Nm 31:42 From half of the share of the Israelites that Moses had set aside from the soldiers 
04Nm 31:43 there wee 337,500 sheep for the community, 
04Nm 31:44 36,000 cattle, 
04Nm 31:45 30,500 donkeys, 
04Nm 31:46 and 16,000 people.
04Nm 31:47 Moses took a portion drawn from every 50 Israelites, including from both human and animals, and gave them to the Levites who maintained the Lord's tabernacle, just as the Lord had commanded Moses.
04Nm 31:48 Then the officers in charge of thousands of soldiers, the captains of thousands, and the captains of hundreds approached Moses 
04Nm 31:49 and told him, "Your servants took a count of the soldiers who were under our authority. We didn't miss a single man. 
04Nm 31:50 We've brought offerings to the Lord from whatever each man found - jewel-encrusted gold, anklets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, and necklaces to make atonement for ourselves in the Lord's presence."
04Nm 31:51 Then Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them and everything that was fashioned into jewels. 
04Nm 31:52 The gold for the raised offering that they brought to the Lord totaled 16,750 shekels, 
04Nm 31:53 because every soldier had confiscated war booty for his own use. 
04Nm 31:54 Moses and Eleazar took the gold from the captains of thousands and hundreds and brought it to the tent of meeting, to serve as a memorial to the Israelites in the Lord's presence.
04Nm 32:1 Now, the Reubenites and Gaddites happened to be joint owners of a very large herd of cattle. When they observed that Jazer and Gilead were good grazing lands for cattle, 
04Nm 32:2 the Gaddites and Reubenites approached Moses, Eleazar the priest, and the leaders of the community and said, 
04Nm 32:3 "Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon - 
04Nm 32:4 the land that the Lord defeated in the sight of the community of Israel - is perfect for cattle and your servants have cattle. 
04Nm 32:5 If we've found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as our possession instead of us crossing the Jordan River.
04Nm 32:6 "Will your relatives have to go to war while you remain here?" Moses asked the Gaddites and Reubenites in response. 
04Nm 32:7 "Why would you discourage the Israelites from crossing over to the land that the Lord has given them -  
04Nm 32:8 That's what your ancestors did when I sent them from Kadesh Barnea to explore the land. 
04Nm 32:9 When they arrived in the Eshcol Valley and saw the land, they discouraged the Israelites from entering the land that the Lord had given them.8
04Nm 32:10 "That's why the Lord's anger flared up that day and he promised by an oath that 
04Nm 32:11 'Not one of the men who went up from Egypt from 20 years old and above will see the land that I promised to give to their ancestors, that is, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because none of them followed me whole heartedly, 
04Nm 32:12 except Jephunneh's son Caleb, the Kenizzite, and Nun's son Joshua. They've whole heartedly followed the Lord.'
04Nm 32:13 "The Lord's anger had flared up against Israel so that he made them wander in the wilderness for 40 years until that whole generation, who committed evil in the eyes of the Lord, had died. 
04Nm 32:14 And now, look! You're acting just like your ancestors, like a brood of sinful men, who are incrementally provoking the fierce anger of the Lord against the Israelites. 
04Nm 32:15 If you stop following him, he will once again abandon them in the wilderness. You'll end up destroying this entire people."14
04Nm 32:16 Then they approached him and said, "Here's where we're going to build corrals for our cattle and cities for our families, 
04Nm 32:17 but we will keep ourselves armed and stay ready to go with the Israelites until we've brought them to their own places. Our families intend to live in fortified cities in the presence of the inhabitants of the land, 
04Nm 32:18 but we won't return to our homes until every Israelite has taken possession of each of their inheritances, 
04Nm 32:19 since our inheritance will not be with them across the Jordan River and beyond. Instead, our inheritance is on this side of the Jordan River, facing eastward."
04Nm 32:20 "If you do this," Moses replied to them, "that is, if you equip yourselves for war in the Lord's presence 
04Nm 32:21 and every one of your armed soldiers crosses over the Jordan River in the presence of the Lord until he has dispossessed his enemies ahead of him 
04Nm 32:22 and subjugated the land before him, then afterwards when you return, you'll be able to stand blameless before the Lord and before Israel. This land will then be your possession before the Lord.
04Nm 32:23 "But if you won't do so, look out! You will be sinning against the Lord. Be certain of this, that your sin will catch up to you! 
04Nm 32:24 So after you've built cities for your families and corrals for your cattle, be sure to keep your promises."
04Nm 32:25 Then the Gaddites and Reubenites spoke, "Your servants will do exactly what our master has commanded. 
04Nm 32:26 Our children, wives, flocks, and all our cattle will be settled in the cities of Gilead, 
04Nm 32:27 but every soldier that we've equipped for battle will cross the Jordan River in the presence of the Lord, as our master has spoken."
04Nm 32:28 So Moses instructed Eleazar the priest and Nun's son Joshua, and the officers of the ancestral tribes of the Israelites, 
04Nm 32:29 telling them, "If the Gaddites and Reubenites cross over the Jordan River with you, that is, all of their soldiers who've been equipped for battle in the Lord's presence, so that the land is subjudated right before your eyes, then you are to give them the land of Gilead as their possession. 
04Nm 32:30 But if the armed men don't cross over with you, then they won't have any possession in the land of Canaan."
04Nm 32:31 "We'll do just what the Lord told your servants," the Gaddites and the Reubenites responded. 
04Nm 32:32 "We are to cross over in battle array in the Lord's presence into the land of Canaan, and afterwards the possession of our inheritance will be in this side of the Jordan River."
04Nm 32:33 So Moses gave to the Gaddites, to the Reubenites, and to the half-tribe of Joseph's son Manasseh the kingdom of Sihon, the king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, the whole land with its cities, and even the territories surrounding it. 
04Nm 32:34 The Gaddites rebuilt Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 
04Nm 32:35 Atrothshophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 
04Nm 32:36 Beth-Nimrah, and Beth-Haran as fortified cities with corrals for sheep. 
04Nm 32:37 The Reubenites rebuilt Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 
04Nm 32:38 Nebo, Baal-Meon, (after having changed their names) and Sibmah. The cities that they rebuilt were renamed.
04Nm 32:39 The descendants of Manasseh's son Machir attacked Gilead and then captured and dispossessed the Amorites who were there. 
04Nm 32:40 That's why Moses gave Gilead to Manasseh's son Machir, who lived there at the time.
04Nm 32:41 Manasseh's son Jair captured their towns and renamed them Havvoth-Jair.

04Nm 33:37 They traveled from Kadesh, then rested in Mount Hor at the outskirts of the land of Edom.
04Nm 33:38 Then Aaron the priest ascended Mount Hor in obedience to the Lord's command and died there, in the fortieth year after the Israelites had come out of the land of Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month. 
04Nm 33:39 Aaron was 123 years old when he died on Mount Hor. 
04Nm 33:40 Meanwhile, the Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev in the land of Canaan, heard of the approach of the Israelites, 
04Nm 33:41 who had traveled from Mount Hor and then rested in Zalmonah.
04Nm 33:42 They traveled from Zalmonah, then rested in Punon.

04Nm 33:48 They traveled from the mountains of Abarim, then rested in the plains of Moab by the Jordan River, across from Jericho.
04Nm 33:49 They rested by the Jordan River in the area from Beth-Jeshimoth to Abel-Shittim in the plains of Moab.
04Nm 33:50 Then the Lord told Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan River across from Jericho, 
04Nm 33:51 "Tell the Israelites that when they have crossed the Jordan River to the land of Canaan, 
04Nm 33:52 they are to drive out all the inhabitants of the land and destroy all their idols and their molten images. You are to demolish all their high places, 
04Nm 33:53 take possession of the land, and live in it, because I've given you the land to inherit.
04Nm 33:54 "You are to divide the land among yourselves by lot according to your families. The larger the families are in number, the larger their inheritance is to be. The lesser the families are  in number, the lesser their inheritance is to be. To whomever the lot falls ,that inheritance goes to him. Divide  it according to your ancestral tribes.
04Nm 33:55 "But if you fail to drive out the inhabitants of the land before you, their survivors will become irritants in your eyes and thorns in your sides, to prick your sides and afflict you in the very land in which youll be living. 
04Nm 33:56 Then, what I had planned to do to them, I'll start to do to you."
04Nm 34:1 The Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 34:2 "Issue these orders to the Israelites£º 'You're about to enter the land of Canaan. This territory has been apportioned to you as your inheritance£º the entire land of Canaan, all the way to its borders."
04Nm 34:3 "'To your south is the Wilderness of Zin, bordering Edom. Your southern border is to extend east toward the far end of the Dead Sea, 
04Nm 34:4 then it is to turn southward to the ascent of Akrabbim, cross Zin, and then run south of Kadesh Barnea and proceed from there to Hazar-Addar and across to Azmon. 
04Nm 34:5 Then the border is to turn from Azmon toward the wadi of Egypt and from there to the Mediterranean Sea."
04Nm 34:6 "The western border is to be the Mediterranean Sea. This is to be the wetern border."34
04Nm 34:7 "Your northern border is to extend from the Mediterranean Sea to Mount Hor. 
04Nm 34:8 From Mount Hor, you are to mark out the entrance to Hammath, with the border running through Zedad, 
04Nm 34:9 then through Ziphron, and then to Hazar-Enan. This is to be the northern border."
04Nm 34:10 "You are to mark the border on the east from Hazar-enan to Shepham. 
04Nm 34:11 The border is then to extend from Shepham to Riblah, on the east side of Ain, then to the Sea of Chinnereth on the east. 
04Nm 34:12 The border is to continue along the Jordan River all the way to the Dead Sea. This is to be your land, as measured by its boundaries."
04Nm 34:13 Moses commanded the Israelites, "You are to inherit this land by lot, just as the Lord commanded to give it to the remaining nine and a half tribes. 
04Nm 34:14 The tribes of Reuben, Gad, and half the tribe of Manasseh, as defined by their ancestoral houses, have received their inheritance. 
04Nm 34:15 These two and a half tribes received their inheritance this side of the Jordan River, east of Jericho, facing the rising sun." 
04Nm 34:16 Then the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 34:17 "These are the names of the men who are to divide the land for your inheritance£º Eleazar the priest and Nun's son Joshua. 
04Nm 34:18 You are to appoint a leader from each tribe to divide the land for inheritance.
04Nm 34:19 "These are the names of the men£º Appoint Jephunneh's son Caleb from the tribe of Judah, 
04Nm 34:20 Ammihud's son Shemuel from the tribe of Simeon; 
04Nm 34:21 Chislon's son Elidad from the tribe of Benjamin; 
04Nm 34:22 and Jogli's son Bukki is to be leader of the tribe of Dan.
04Nm 34:23 "From the tribe of Joseph, you are to appoint Ephod's son Hanniel  to be leader of the half tribe of Manasseh; 
04Nm 34:24  Shiphtan's son Kemuel to be leader of the half tribe of Ephraim. 
04Nm 34:25 Parnach's son Elizaphan to be leader of the tribe of Zebulun; 
04Nm 34:26  Azzan's son Paltiel to be leader of the tribe of Issachar; 
04Nm 34:27 Shelomi's son Ahihud to be leader of the tribe of Asher; 
04Nm 34:28 and Ammihud's son Pedahel to be leader of the tribe of Naphtali."
04Nm 34:29 These are the ones whom the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance of the Israelites in the land of Canaan.
04Nm 35:1 The Lord spoke to Moses in the wilderness of Moab, beside the Jordan River in Jericho. He told him, 
04Nm 35:2 "Instruct the Israelites to set aside a portion of their inheritance for the Levites to live in, along with grazing land surrounding their towns. 
04Nm 35:3 The towns are to be reserved for their dwelling places and the grazing lands are to be reserved for their cattle, livestock, and all their animals.
04Nm 35:4 "The grazing lands that you are to reserve for use by Levites are to extend 1,500 feet from the walls of the town. 
04Nm 35:5 You are to measure from outside the wall of the town on the east side 3,000 feet, on the south side 3,000 feet, on the west side 3,000 feet, and on the north side 3,000 feet, with the town placed at the center. This reserved area is to serve as grazing land for their towns. 
04Nm 35:6 You are to set aside six towns of refuge from the towns that you will be giving to the Levites, where someone who kills a human being may run for shelter. In addition, give them 42 other towns.
04Nm 35:7 "The total number of towns that you are to give to the Levites is to be 48 towns, including grazing lands surrounding these town. 
04Nm 35:8 You are to apportion the towns that you will be giving the Israelites according to the relative size of the tribe. Take a larger portion from those larger in numbers and a lesser portion from those lesser in number. Each is to set aside towns for the Levites proportional to the size of their inheritance that they receive."
04Nm 35:9 Then the Lord told Moses, 
04Nm 35:10 "Tell the Israelites that when they have crossed the Jordan River into the land of Canaan, 
04Nm 35:11 they are to designate some towns of refuge so that anyone who kills someone inadvertently may flee there. 
04Nm 35:12 They are to serve as cities of refuge from a blood avenger in order to keep the inadvertent killer from dying until he has stood trial in the presence of the community. 
04Nm 35:13 You are to set aside six towns of refuge. 
04Nm 35:14 Appoint three towns this side of the Jordan River and three towns in the land of Canaan to serve as the towns of refuge, 
04Nm 35:15 that is, places of refuge for the Israelites, the resident alien, and any travelers among them. Anyone who kills a person inadvertently may flee there."12
04Nm 35:16 "Whoever uses an iron implement to kill someone is to be adjudged a murderer, and that murderer is certainly to be put to death.
04Nm 35:17 "Furthermore, whoever uses a stone implement to kill someone is to be adjudged a murderer, and that murderer is certainly to be put to death.
04Nm 35:18 "Also, whoever uses a wooden implement to kill someone with it is to be adjudged a murderer, and that murderer is certainly to be put to death.
04Nm 35:19 "The blood avenger himself is to execute the murderer. When he meets him, the murderer is to put him to death. 
04Nm 35:20 If the killer shoved him out of hatred, or hurled something at him while waiting in ambush so that he died, 
04Nm 35:21 or if he struck him with his hand out of hatred so that he dies, then the killed is certainly to be put to death for murder. The avenger of blood is to put him to death when he meets him."
04Nm 35:22 "But if he pushed him suddenly without hatred, or had he hurled something in his direction without waiting in ambush, 
04Nm 35:23 or if he hit him with a stone carelessly so that he was fatally injured, though he isn't his enemy and he wasn't seeking to commit evil against him, 
04Nm 35:24 then the community is to judge between the inadvertent killer and the blood avenger, following these ordinances. 
04Nm 35:25 The community is to release the inadvertent killer from the blood avenger and return him to the town of refuge where he had fled. He is to live there until the High Priest dies, who will have anointed him with holy oil.
04Nm 35:26 "But if the inadvertent killer leaves the town of refuge where he had fled 
04Nm 35:27 and the blood avenger finds him outside the town of refuge where he had fled and kills him, the blood avenger is not to be found guilty of murder. 
04Nm 35:28 The inadvertent killer is to live in the town of refuge until the High Priest dies. After the death of the High Priest, the inadvertent killer is to return to the land of his inheritance. 
04Nm 35:29 These are to be the statutes and ordinance for you throughout all your generations, regardless of where you live."
04Nm 35:30 "Every murderer of a human being is to be executed only according to testimony given by multiple witnesses. A single witness is not to result in a death sentence.
04Nm 35:31 "You are to receive no ransom for the life of a killer who is guilty of murder; instead, he is to die. 
04Nm 35:32 You are not to receive payment of a ransom for someone who had fled to a town of refuge but then left to live in his homeland before the death of the high priest.
04Nm 35:33 "You are not to pollute the land where you live, because blood defiles the land, and the land cannot atone for blood that has been spilled on it, except through the blood of the one who spilled it. 
04Nm 35:34 You are not to defile the land where you will be living, because I'm living among you. I am the Lord, who lives in Israel."
04Nm 36:1 The leaders of the ancestral families of the Gileadites, who were descendants of Machir, and descendants of Manasseh, from Joseph's tribe, approached and spoke to Moses and the leaders of the ancestral houses of the Israelites.
04Nm 36:2 "The Lord commanded my master to apportion the land as an inheritance by lot to the Israelites," they said. "Now my master was ordered by the Lord to give the inheritance of our brother Zelophehad to his daughters.
04Nm 36:3 "But when they get married to one of the descendants of the tribes of Israel, their inheritances are to be withdrawn from our father's inheritance and added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they are to belong. Consequently, it is to be withdrawn from the portion of our inheritance.
04Nm 36:4 "But when the Jubilee Year of the Israelites comes, their inheritance will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they have come to belong. Their inheritance will thus be taken away from the inheritance of our father's tribe!"
04Nm 36:5 So Moses issued the Israelites these orders based on what the Lord said£º "The tribe of the descendants of Joseph has spoken. 
04Nm 36:6 This is what the Lord is commanding the daughters of Zelophehad. If they decide it's a good idea in their opinion to get married only within the family of their father's tribe, then let them get married 
04Nm 36:7 so that the inheritance of the Israelites won't be turned over from one tribe to another. "Each one has an inheritance from his own father's tribe that the Israelites are to maintain. 
04Nm 36:8 Every daughter who is in possession of an inheritance from the Israelites is to marry someone from the families within her father's tribe so the Israelites can retain possession of their ancestral inheritance. 
04Nm 36:9 That way, their inheritance won't be turned over from one tribe to another, because the Israelites are each to maintain their ancestral inheritances."
04Nm 36:10 Zelophehad's daughters did just what the Lord had commanded Moses 
04Nm 36:11 for Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah£º Zelophehad's daughters married their uncle's sons. 
04Nm 36:12 They married into families of the descendants of Manaseh, that is, Joseph's descendants, so that their inheritance remained within the tribe of their ancestor's family.
04Nm 36:13 These were the commands and the ordinances that the Lord issued to the Israelites through Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan River in Jericho.
