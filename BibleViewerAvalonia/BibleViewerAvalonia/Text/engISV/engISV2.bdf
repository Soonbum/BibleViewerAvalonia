05Dt 1:1 Deut 1These are the words that Moses spoke to the assembly of Israel east of the Jordan River, in the Arabah desert, opposite Suph between Paran, Tophel, Laban, Hazeroth, and Di-zahab. 
05Dt 1:2 It takes 11 days to travel from Horeb to Kadesh-barnea via Mount Seir.
05Dt 1:3 On the first day of the eleventh month, in the fortieth year, Moses spoke to the Israelites about everything that the Lord had commanded him concerning them. 
05Dt 1:4 This took place after he defeated Sihon, king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon and Og, king of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth at Edrei.
05Dt 1:5 East of the Jordan River, in the land of Moab, Moses began to expound this Law£º 
05Dt 1:6 "The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb. He said, 'You have been at this mountain long enough. 
05Dt 1:7 Break camp, get going, and proceed to the hill country of the Amorites and all the nearby places in the Arabah desert, the highlands, the foothills, the Negev, the coastal plains, all of the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon as far as the great river, the Euphrates. 
05Dt 1:8 Look! I've given you the land that lies ahead. Go in and possess the land that I, the Lord, promised to give to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, as well as to their descendants.'" 
05Dt 1:9 "I also told you at that time that I won't be able to sustain you on my own. 
05Dt 1:10 The Lord your God greatly multiplied your numbers, and today you are like the stars in the sky. 
05Dt 1:11 May the Lord, the God of your ancestors, increase your numbers a thousand times more, and may he bless you, as he promised you. 
05Dt 1:12 How can I bear the burden of you and your bickering all by myself?
05Dt 1:13 Choose for yourselves wise and discerning men, known to your tribes, and appoint them as your leaders.
05Dt 1:14 "You answered by saying that this plan is a good thing. 
05Dt 1:15 So I chose leaders from your tribes, wise and respected men, and I appointed them over you - commanders of thousands, hundreds, fifties, and tens.
05Dt 1:16 "I charged your judges at that time, 'When you hold a hearing between brothers, judge fairly between a man and his brother or between foreigners. 
05Dt 1:17 When you hold a hearing, don't be partial in judgment toward the least important or toward the great. Never fear men, because judgment belongs to God. If the matter is difficult for you, bring it to me for a hearing. 
05Dt 1:18 I charged you at that time that you must do all of these things.'"
05Dt 1:19 "Then we set out from Horeb and walked through that vast and dreadful desert, where you observed the road to the Amorite hill country. Just as the Lord our God ordained for us, we finally arrived at Kadesh Barnea. 
05Dt 1:20 I told you at that time, 'You have reached the hill country of the Amorites, which the Lord our God is about to give us. 
05Dt 1:21 Look! The Lord your God has given the land that lies before you. Go and possess it, just as the Lord God of your ancestors commanded you. Don't be afraid or discouraged.' 
05Dt 1:22 "Then all of you approached me and said£º 'Let's send out men in advance of us so they can survey the land and bring back a report to us on how we'll go up to their cities.' 
05Dt 1:23 Because this suggestion seemed good to me, I chose twelve men from among you, one from each tribe. 
05Dt 1:24 "Then these men set out, went up to the hill county, reached the Eshcol Valley, and surveyed it. 
05Dt 1:25 They hand-picked some of the fruit of the land, brought it down to us, and gave a report that said, 'The land which the Lord is about to give us is good.'"
05Dt 1:26 "However, your ancestors didn't go up. Instead, they rebelled against the command of the Lord your God. 
05Dt 1:27 You murmured in your tents, 'The Lord hates us. He brought us out of the land of Egypt in order to deliver us to the Amorites so he could destroy us. 
05Dt 1:28 Where can we go?Our brothers discouraged us when they said that the people are bigger and taller than we are. Their cities are tall and fortified to the sky, and we also saw the Anakim there.'27
05Dt 1:29 "Then I said to you, 'Don't be terrified or afraid of them. 
05Dt 1:30 The Lord your God is the One who will be going ahead of you. He'll fight for you just as he did in Egypt before your eyes. 
05Dt 1:31 In the desert you saw that the Lord carried you like a man carries his son, on every road you traveled until you reached this place.' 
05Dt 1:32 But despite this, you didn't trust in the Lord your God, 
05Dt 1:33 who walked ahead of you along the way to scout a place for you to pitch camp - by fire at night and cloud by day - to lead you on the way you should go."
05Dt 1:34 "When the Lord heard your complaints, he became angry and declared,
05Dt 1:35 'I swear that not one man of this evil generation will see the good land that I promised to give to your ancestors, 
05Dt 1:36 except Jephunneh's son Caleb. He will see it and I will give to him and to his descendants the land on which he has walked because he wholeheartedly followed the Lord.' 
05Dt 1:37 "The Lord was also furious with me because of you. He said£º 'You will not enter the land. 
05Dt 1:38 However, Nun's son Joshua, your assistant, will go there. Encourage him, for he will cause Israel to take possession of it. 
05Dt 1:39 Your little ones - whom you said would be taken captive - and your children who do not yet know right from wrong, will enter the land. I will give it to them and they themselves will possess it. 
05Dt 1:40 But as for you, prepare to set out for the desert on the way to the Reed Sea.'
05Dt 1:41 "You responded to me and said, 'We have sinned against the Lord. We will now go up and fight according to what the Lord our God commanded.' So each man put on his weapon for battle and recklessly started out for the hill country."
05Dt 1:42 "Then the Lord told me£º 'Tell them not to go up and fight because I will not be in their midst, or else you will be defeated before your enemies.'
05Dt 1:43 "I spoke to you but you didn't listen. Instead you rebelled against the command of the Lord and went up to the hill country. 
05Dt 1:44 The Amorites who lived in the hill country came out to engage you in battle. They pursued you like bees do and crushed you from Seir to Hormah. 
05Dt 1:45 You returned and cried out in the Lord's presence, but the Lord didn't hear your voice or listen to you. 
05Dt 1:46 You remained in Kadesh for many days. It was a long time, indeed."
05Dt 2:1 "We turned and set out for the desert on the road to the Reed Sea just as the Lord had directed me. We traveled around Mount Seir for many days. 
05Dt 2:2 "Then the Lord said to me, 
05Dt 2:3 'You went around this mountain long enough. Turn northward 
05Dt 2:4 and command this people, "You are about to pass through the territory of your relatives, the descendants of Esau who live around Seir. They will be afraid of you so be very careful. 
05Dt 2:5 Don't fight them, because I won't give you any part of their land, not even the size of a footprint. I have given Mount Seir to Esau as their property. 
05Dt 2:6 You may buy food to eat and water to drink from them, paying with cash."' 
05Dt 2:7 Indeed, the Lord your God blessed all the works of your hands. He knows about your travels through this vast desert. The Lord your God was with you this past 40 years, so that you didn't lack anything. 
05Dt 2:8 So we bypassed our relatives, the descendants of Esau who live in Seir. We turned through the Arabah desert from Elath, and from Ezion-geber we traveled the desert road to Moab."6
05Dt 2:9 "Then the Lord said to me, 'Don't harass Moab or provoke them to war, because I won't give you any part of their land. I have given Ar to the descendants of Lot as their property. 
05Dt 2:10 (The Emites, a people as powerful, numerous, and tall as the Anakim, lived there before. 
05Dt 2:11 Like the Anakim, they were thought of as Rephaim, but the Moabites called them Emites. 
05Dt 2:12 The Horites used to live in Seir before the descendants of Esau dispossessed them, exterminated them, and settled there instead, just as Israel will do in the land of its possession, which the Lord gave them.) 
05Dt 2:13 Now get going and cross the Wadi Zered.' And so we crossed the Wadi Zered.11
05Dt 2:14 "Now from the time we left Kadesh Barnea until we crossed the Wadi Zered was 38 years. All of that generation, the soldiers in the camp, were destroyed just as the Lord swore they would be. 
05Dt 2:15 Indeed, the hand of the Lord was against them to root them out from the camp until they were utterly destroyed."
05Dt 2:16 "And so all the soldiers among the people died. 
05Dt 2:17 Then the Lord spoke to me, 
05Dt 2:18 'Today, you are about to cross the border of Moab at Ar. 
05Dt 2:19 When you come to the Ammonites, don't harass or provoke them to war, for I won't give any part of Ammonite land to you, since I have given it to the descendants of Lot as their property.'
05Dt 2:20 "'(Indeed, it was considered Rephaim territory, since the Rephaim used to lived there. The Ammonites called them Zamzummites, 
05Dt 2:21 a great people, numerous, and tall as the Anakim. But the Lord destroyed the Rephaim, so that the Ammonites dispossessed them and settled there instead. 
05Dt 2:22 This is what he did for the descendants of Esau who live in Seir, when he destroyed the Horites before them. So they dispossessed them and settled there in their place, where they live to this day. 
05Dt 2:23 It was the same for the Avvites who lived in villages as far as Gaza. The Caphtorites, who came from Crete, destroyed them and settled there in their place.)
05Dt 2:24 "'Get ready and set out for the Wadi Arnon. Look! I've given into your control Sihon king of Heshbon, the Amorite, along with his land. Prepare to take possession by provoking him to war. 
05Dt 2:25 Starting today I will begin to instill fear and terror of you on the part of every nation under heaven who hears reports about you. They'll tremble in anguish before you.'"
05Dt 2:26 "I sent messengers from the desert of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon, with this message of peace£º 
05Dt 2:27 'Let me pass through your territory. I'll stay on the main road. I won't turn to the right or left. 
05Dt 2:28 Sell me food for cash so I can eat and give me water for cash, so I can drink. Just let me pass through on foot 
05Dt 2:29 as the descendants of Esau who live in Seir did for me, as did the Moabites who live in Ar. I'll pass through, until I will have crossed the Jordan into the land that the Lord our God is about to give us.' 
05Dt 2:30 But Sihon king of Heshbon did not allow us to pass through, because the Lord your God had hardened his spirit and made him arrogant, in order to deliver him into your control today.
05Dt 2:31 "Then the Lord said to me, 'See, I've begun to deliver Sihon and his territory over to you. Prepare to take possession of his land.' 
05Dt 2:32 "Sihon came out to meet us, including his entire his army, at the battle of Jahaz. 
05Dt 2:33 The Lord our God delivered him to us, so we attacked him, his son, and his whole army. 
05Dt 2:34 We captured all his towns at that time. We utterly destroyed every town - the men, the women, and the children, leaving no survivors. 
05Dt 2:35 We only appropriated the livestock for our use, along with plunder from the cities that we captured. 
05Dt 2:36 From Aroer on the edge of Arnon Valley and from the town all the way to Gilead, there was no city that was too strong for us - the Lord our God delivered them all to us. 
05Dt 2:37 You did not encroach onto Ammonite land, the banks of the Wadi Jabbok, the towns in the hill country, and all the other places that were forbidden by the Lord our God."
05Dt 3:1 "We set out and went up along the road to Bashan. Then Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us - he and his whole army - for a battle at Edrei. 
05Dt 3:2 "Then the Lord said to me, 'Don't fear him, because I've delivered him, his army, and his territory into your control. Do to him just as you have done to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon.' 
05Dt 3:3 "So the Lord our God also delivered into our control Og king of Bashan, along with his whole army. We attacked him until there were no survivors. 
05Dt 3:4 Then we captured all his cities at that time. There was not a city left that we didn't capture from them - sixty cities in all from the region of Argob, which is part of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
05Dt 3:5 All of these cities were fortified with high walls, gates, and bars. Furthermore, there were very many unwalled regions. 
05Dt 3:6 We utterly destroyed them, just as we did Sihon king of Heshbon, attacking them in every city - the men, women, and children. 
05Dt 3:7 But we kept for ourselves all of the livestock and plunder from the towns.5
05Dt 3:8 "So at that time we took control from the two Amorite kings the territory east of the Jordan from Wadi Arnon to Mount Hermon. 
05Dt 3:9 (The Sidonians called Hermon Sirion, but the Amorites called it Senir.) 
05Dt 3:10 We took control of all the cities of the plain, all of Gilead and Bashan as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 
05Dt 3:11 Only Og the king of Bashan remained from the remnants of the Rephaim. In fact, his bed was made of iron. It's in Rabbah of the Ammonites, isn't it?It's about thirteen and a half feet long and six feet wide."
05Dt 3:12 "Of the land that we captured at that time, I've given its towns to the Reubenites and the Gaddites from Aroer near the Wadi Arnon to half of the hill country of Gilead. 
05Dt 3:13 The remainder of Gilead and Bashan of the kingdom of Og, I've given to the half-tribe of Manasseh. (The whole region of Argob - that is, all of Bashan - is called the land of the Rephaim.) 
05Dt 3:14 Manasseh's son Yair captured all the Argob region as far as the territory of the Geshurites and the Maacathites. Bashan was named after him; that's why it is called Havvoth-jair to this day. 
05Dt 3:15 Furthermore, I've given Gilead to Machir. 
05Dt 3:16 And I've given Gilead to the Reubenites and the Gadites as far as the Arnon Valley, designating the middle of the valley as its boundary, including up to the Jabbok River as a boundary with the Ammonites. 
05Dt 3:17 The Arabah and the Jordan River are also a boundary from Kinnereth to the Sea of the Arabah (that is, the Salt Sea), below the slopes of Pisgah on the east."
05Dt 3:18 "Then I commanded you at that time, 'The Lord your God gave you this land as a possession. Those equipped for battle - every man a warrior - will cross before your fellow Israelites. 
05Dt 3:19 However, your women, children, and livestock - and I know you have many - may reside in your towns that I gave you 
05Dt 3:20 until the Lord grants rest to your fellow Israelites like you. When they take possession of the territory that the Lord your God is about to give them on the east side of the Jordan River, then each of you may return to the territory that I've allotted for you.' 
05Dt 3:21 "I also charged Joshua at that time, 'You witnessed everything that the Lord your God did to the two kings. Indeed, the Lord will do this to all the kingdoms which you are about to enter. 
05Dt 3:22 You are not to fear them, because the Lord your God will fight for you.'"
05Dt 3:23 "I pleaded with the Lord at that time, 
05Dt 3:24 'Lord God, you've begun to show your greatness and your strong power to your servant. For what god in heaven or on earth can equal your works and mighty deeds?
05Dt 3:25 Let me cross over that I may see the good land on the other side of the Jordan River, the good hill country, as well as Lebanon.' 
05Dt 3:26 "However, the Lord was furious with me because of you. He did not listen to me. Instead, the Lord said, 'You are not to speak to me about this matter again! 
05Dt 3:27 Go up to the top of Pisgah and lift your eyes toward the west, north, south, and east. Look with your own eyes, since you won't be able to cross this Jordan River. 
05Dt 3:28 Therefore charge Joshua to be doubly strong, for he will lead this people and cause them to inherit the land that you'll see.' 
05Dt 3:29 We then encamped in the valley opposite Beth-peor."
05Dt 4:1 "Now, Israel, listen to the statutes and the ordinances that I'm teaching you to observe so you may live and go in to take possession of the land that the Lord, the God of your ancestors, is about to give you. 
05Dt 4:2 Do not add or subtract a thing to what I'm commanding you. Observe the commands of the Lord your God.
05Dt 4:3 "You saw with your own eyes what he did in Baal Peor. The Lord your God exterminated from among you every man who followed Baal of Peor. 
05Dt 4:4 But all of you who are clinging to the Lord your God are alive today. 
05Dt 4:5 See! I taught you the statutes and the ordinances, just as the Lord God commanded. Therefore, observe them when you enter the land you are about to possess. 
05Dt 4:6 Observe them carefully, for this will show your wisdom and discernment in the eyes of people who'll listen to all these decrees. Then they'll say£º 'Surely this great nation is a wise and discerning people.' 
05Dt 4:7 For what great nation has a god so near like the Lord our God whenever we call on him?
05Dt 4:8 And what great nation has all the decrees and righteous ordinances like all this teaching that I'm giving you today?
05Dt 4:9 Only guard yourselves carefully so you won't forget the things that you saw and let them slip from your mind for the rest of your life. Tell them to your children and to your grandchildren. 
05Dt 4:10 The day you stood in the presence of the Lord your God in Horeb, the Lord said to me, 'Gather the people before me so they may hear my words, learn to revere me the whole time that they live in the land, and teach them to their children.'"
05Dt 4:11 "When you approached and stood at the foot of the mountain - a mountain that was blazing with fire at its core while the sky was covered with thick, dark clouds?
05Dt 4:12 the Lord your God spoke from the midst of the fire. You heard the sound of words, but you saw no form; there was only a voice. 
05Dt 4:13 He declared to you his covenant, which he commanded you to observe - the Ten Commandments that he wrote on two stone tablets. 
05Dt 4:14 The Lord commanded me at that time to teach you to observe the statutes and ordinances in the land after you cross over to take possession of it.11
05Dt 4:15 "Therefore, for your own sake, be very careful, since you did not see any form on the day that the Lord your God spoke to you in Horeb from the midst of the fire. 
05Dt 4:16 Be careful! Otherwise, you will be destroyed when you make carved images for yourself - all sorts of images in the form of man, woman, 
05Dt 4:17 any animal on earth, any winged bird that flies in the sky, 
05Dt 4:18 any creeping thing on the ground, or any fish in the sea. 
05Dt 4:19 Do not gaze toward the heavens and observe the sun, the moon, the stars - the entire array of the sky - with the intent to worship and serve what the Lord your God gave every nation. 
05Dt 4:20 For the Lord took you and brought you out of the iron-smelting furnace - out of Egypt - to be the people of his inheritance, as you are today.
05Dt 4:21 "But the Lord was angry with me because of you. So he swore that I'll never cross the Jordan River to enter the good land that the Lord your God is about to give you as an inheritance. 
05Dt 4:22 For I'm going to die in this land and I won't cross the Jordan River, but you're about to cross over to possess that good land. 
05Dt 4:23 Be careful! Otherwise, you will forget the covenant of the Lord your God, who established that covenant with you. Don't make carved images of any likeness in violation of everything that you were commanded by the Lord your God. 
05Dt 4:24 Indeed, the Lord your God is a consuming fire. He is a jealous God."
05Dt 4:25 "After you've borne children and grandchildren, have been there for a long time in the land, have become so corrupted that you make images of any form, and have done evil in the eyes of the Lord your God, you will provoke him to anger. 
05Dt 4:26 Heaven and earth will testify against what has occurred today£º you'll surely and swiftly be destroyed from the land that you are about to possess by crossing the Jordan River. You won't live long in it, because you'll certainly be exterminated. 
05Dt 4:27 Moreover, the Lord will scatter you among the peoples, and you'll be fewer in number in the nations where the Lord your God will drive you. 
05Dt 4:28 There you'll serve gods made by human hands, serving trees and stones that cannot see, hear, eat, nor smell. 
05Dt 4:29 "If from there you will seek the Lord your God, then you will find him if you seek him with all your heart and soul. 
05Dt 4:30 "In your distress, when all these things happen to you in days to come and you return to the Lord your God, then you will hear his voice. 
05Dt 4:31 For God is compassionate. The Lord your God won't fail you. He won't destroy you or forget the covenant that he confirmed with your ancestors."
05Dt 4:32 "Indeed, ask from one end of the heavens to the other about days of old, before your time when God created mankind on the earth. Did we ever have anything as great as this, or ever hear of anything like it?
05Dt 4:33 Has any people heard the voice of God speaking from the middle of a fire just as you did, and survived it?
05Dt 4:34 Or has any god ever taken for himself one nation out from another nation with testings, signs, wonders, wars, awesome power, and magnificent, terrifying deeds as the Lord your God did in Egypt before your eyes - 33
05Dt 4:35 "You have been shown this in order to know that 'the Lord is God' and there is no one like him. 
05Dt 4:36 You have been made to hear his voice from heaven so you may be instructed. And he showed you his great fire here on earth, and you heard his voice from the middle of that fire. 
05Dt 4:37 Moreover, he loved your ancestors, chose their descendants after them, and brought you out of Egypt, accompanied by his presence and great power, 
05Dt 4:38 in order to drive out nations that are stronger and more powerful than you, to bring you into this land, and to give you their land as an inheritance, as it is today. 
05Dt 4:39 "May you acknowledge and take to heart this day that the Lord is God in the heavens above and over the earth below - there is no other God. 
05Dt 4:40 May you observe his statutes and keep his commands that I'm giving you today, so that life may go well for you and for your descendants after you. That way, you'll live a long life in the land that the Lord your God is about to give you permanently." 
05Dt 4:41 Then Moses designated three cities on the east side of the Jordan, 
05Dt 4:42 where a person who accidentally killed someone could flee, if he killed his neighbor without having enmity toward him in the past. He may flee to one of these cities and live£º 
05Dt 4:43 Bezer in the desert plain for the Reubenites, Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.
05Dt 4:44 This is the Law that Moses reviewed in the presence of the Israelites. 
05Dt 4:45 These are the instructions, decrees, and ordinances that Moses declared to the Israelites when they came out of Egypt. 
05Dt 4:46 He did this east of the Jordan, in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and whom Moses and the Israelites defeated after leaving Egypt. 
05Dt 4:47 So they took possession of his land, as well as the land of Og king of Bashan. Both Amorite kings lived east of the Jordan - 
05Dt 4:48 from Aroer on the edge of the Wadi Arnon as far as Mount Sirion, which is also called Hermon, 
05Dt 4:49 and all the Arabah east of the Jordan as far as the Dead Sea below the slopes of Pisgah.4
05Dt 5:1 Moses called all of Israel together and told them£º "Listen, Israel! Today I'm going to announce God's laws and regulations so that you will learn them and take care to obey them. 
05Dt 5:2 When the Lord our God made a covenant with us in Horeb, 
05Dt 5:3 it was not with our ancestors that the Lord made this covenant, but with us - we who are here today - all of us who are now living. 
05Dt 5:4 The Lord spoke to you face to face on the mountain from the fire. 
05Dt 5:5 I stood at that time as mediator between the Lord and you to declare his message to you, because you were afraid of the fire and would not go up the mountain. He said:
05Dt 5:6 "I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt - from the house of slavery.
05Dt 5:7 "You are to have no other gods besides me. 
05Dt 5:8 You are not to make for yourselves a carved image resembling any form in the heavens above, on earth below, or in the waters under the earth. 
05Dt 5:9 You are not to bow down to them in worship or serve them; because I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God, punishing the children for the iniquity of their parents, to the third and fourth generations of those who hate me, 
05Dt 5:10 but showing gracious love to the thousandth generation of those who love me and keep my commandments.
05Dt 5:11 "You are not to misuse the name of the Lord your God, because the Lord will not leave the one who misuses his name unpunished.
05Dt 5:12 "Keep the Sabbath day holy, just as the Lord your God commanded. 
05Dt 5:13 Six days you are to labor and do all your work, 
05Dt 5:14 but the seventh day is a Sabbath for the Lord your God. You are not to do any work£º neither you, your children, your male and female servants, your oxen and donkeys, all your livestock, as well as the foreigners who live among you, so that your male and female servants may rest as you do. 1
05Dt 5:15 Remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, but the Lord your God brought you out from there with great power and a show of force. Therefore the Lord your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.12
05Dt 5:16 "Honor your father and your mother, just as the Lord your God commanded you, so that your life will be long and things will go well for you in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.
05Dt 5:17 "You are not to murder.
05Dt 5:18 "You are not to commit adultery.
05Dt 5:19 "You are not to steal.
05Dt 5:20 "You are not to testify falsely against your neighbor.
05Dt 5:21 "You are not to desire your neighbor's wife, or covet your neighbor's house, fields, his male and female servants, his ox, his donkey, or anything that concerns your neighbor."
05Dt 5:22 "These commands the Lord declared in a loud voice to your entire assembly on the mountain from out of the fire and dark clouds, and nothing more was added. He inscribed them on two tablets of stones and gave them to me.
05Dt 5:23 "When you heard the voice from the darkness while the mountain was blazing, all the leaders and elders of your tribes came to me and said£º 
05Dt 5:24 'The Lord our God truly has displayed his glory and power, for we heard him from out of the fire today. We have witnessed how God spoke to human beings, yet they lived. 
05Dt 5:25 Now therefore, why should we die?This great fire will consume us. If we continue to listen to the voice of the Lord our God any longer, we'll die. 
05Dt 5:26 For what mortal man has heard the voice of the living God speaking out of the fire like we did, and lived?
05Dt 5:27 As for you, go near and listen to everything that the Lord our God will say to you. Then repeat it to us, then we will listen and obey.'5
05Dt 5:28 "The Lord heard what you said. He said to me£º 'I've heard what this people said. Everything they said was good. 
05Dt 5:29 If only they would commit to fear me and keep all my commands, then it will go well with them and their children forever.5
05Dt 5:30 "'Go and tell them to return to their tents, 
05Dt 5:31 but you stand here with me and I'll speak to you all the commands, decrees, and laws that you must teach them to observe in the land that I'm giving you to possess. 
05Dt 5:32 You must be careful to do what the Lord your God commanded you, turning neither to the left nor to the right. 
05Dt 5:33 Walk in every way that the Lord your God commanded you, so that life may go well for you, and so that you will prolong your days in the land that you will possess.'"
05Dt 6:1 "Now these are the commands, decrees, and ordinances that the Lord commanded me to teach you. Obey them in the land you are entering to possess, 
05Dt 6:2 so that you, your children, and your grandchildren may fear the Lord your God. Keep all his decrees and commandments that I'm giving you every day of your life, so you may live a long time.
05Dt 6:3 "Listen, Israel! Be careful to obey, so that life may go well for you and that you may increase greatly. Just as the Lord God of your ancestors told you, you'll have a land flowing with milk and honey.
05Dt 6:4 "Listen, Israel! The Lord is our God, the Lord alone. 
05Dt 6:5 You are to love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, and all your strength.
05Dt 6:6 "Let these words that I'm commanding you today be always on your heart. 
05Dt 6:7 Teach them repeatedly to your children. Talk about them while sitting in your house or walking on the road, and as you lie down or get up. 
05Dt 6:8 Tie them as reminders on your forearm, bind them on your forehead, 
05Dt 6:9 and write them on the door frames of your house and on your gates."7
05Dt 6:10 "When the Lord your God brings you to the land that he promised to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, he will give you large and beautiful cities that you didn't build, 
05Dt 6:11 houses filled with every good thing that you didn't supply, wells that you didn't dig, and vineyards and olive groves that you didn't plant. When you eat and are satisfied, 
05Dt 6:12 be careful not to forget the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt and slavery. 
05Dt 6:13 Fear the Lord your God, serve him, and make your oaths in his name. 
05Dt 6:14 Do not follow other gods, from the gods of the peoples around you. 
05Dt 6:15 For the Lord your God who is among you is a jealous God. He will turn his anger against you and destroy you from the surface of the land."
05Dt 6:16 "Don't test the Lord your God like you tried to do in Massah. 
05Dt 6:17 Be sure to observe the commands of the Lord your God, his testimonies and his decrees that he gave you. 
05Dt 6:18 Do what is good and right in the Lord's sight so it may go well with you. Then you'll enter and possess the good land that the Lord your God promised to your ancestors, 
05Dt 6:19 expelling all your enemies before you, as the Lord said."
05Dt 6:20 "When your son asks you in the future, 'What is the meaning of the instructions, decrees, and ordinances that the Lord our God commanded you?' 
05Dt 6:21 tell him, 'We were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, but the Lord brought us out of Egypt with great power. 
05Dt 6:22 Before our very eyes, the Lord did great and terrible signs and wonders in Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to his entire household. 
05Dt 6:23 But as for us, he brought us out from there to bring us into the land and it to us, as he promised our ancestors. 
05Dt 6:24 Then the Lord commanded us to observe all these decrees and to fear the Lord our God for our own good, so that he may keep us alive as we are today. 
05Dt 6:25 It will be credited as righteousness for us, if we're careful to obey the entire law in the presence of the Lord our God, as he commanded.'"
05Dt 7:1 "When the Lord your God brings you into the land that you are entering to possess, he will drive out many nations before you£º the Hittites, Girgashites, Amorites, Canaanites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites, seven nations who are more numerous and stronger than you. 
05Dt 7:2 So when the Lord your God delivers them to you and you have defeated them, then utterly destroy them. You are not to make any covenant with them nor be gracious to them. 
05Dt 7:3 You are not to intermarry with them. You are not to give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters for your sons, 
05Dt 7:4 because they will turn your children from me to serve other gods so that the Lord's anger blazes against you and swiftly destroys you by fire. 
05Dt 7:5 This is what you will do to them£º tear down their altars, break their pillars, cut down their ritual pillars, and burn their carved idols in fire, 
05Dt 7:6 because you are a holy people to the Lord your God. The Lord your God chose you to be his people, his treasured possession from all the peoples on the face of the earth."
05Dt 7:7 "It was not because you were more numerous than other people of the earth that the Lord committed himself to you and chose you. In fact, you were the least numerous of all the peoples. 
05Dt 7:8 But the Lord loved you and kept his oath that he made to your ancestors. The Lord brought you out with great power from slavery, from the control of Pharaoh, king of Egypt.
05Dt 7:9 "Know that the Lord your God is God, the trusted God who faithfully keeps his covenant to the thousandth generation of those who love him and obey his commands. 
05Dt 7:10 But for the one who hates him, he will repay him by destroying him. He will not delay dealing with someone who hates him. 
05Dt 7:11 Therefore keep the commands, decrees, and the ordinances that I am instructing you to obey today."
05Dt 7:12 "If you pay attention to these laws and obey them, then the Lord your God will continue with you his covenant of gracious love that he promised with an oath to your ancestors. 
05Dt 7:13 He will love you and increase your numbers. He will bless the fruit of your womb, the fruit of your land (the grain, new wine, and oil), the offspring of your herds, and the lambs of your flock, in the land that the Lord promised your ancestors he would give you. 
05Dt 7:14 You will be blessed among all the nations. There will be no infertility among you, not even among your herds. 
05Dt 7:15 The Lord will turn aside every disease from you. He will not inflict on you the terrible diseases you knew in Egypt, but will inflict them instead on all who hate you. 
05Dt 7:16 You are to utterly destroy everyone whom the Lord your God will deliver to you. Do not have pity on them nor serve their gods. Otherwise, they will become a snare for you."13
05Dt 7:17 "You may say to yourselves, 'These nations are more numerous than we are. How can we dispossess them?' 
05Dt 7:18 But you must not fear them. Be sure to remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh and all of Egypt. 
05Dt 7:19 Your eyes saw the great trials, the signs and wonders, the awesome power with which the Lord your God brought you out.
05Dt 7:20 "The Lord your God will do the same to all the people whom you fear. He'll send plagues against them until the survivors who hide from you have perished. 
05Dt 7:21 Do not tremble before them, for the Lord your God, who is among you, is a great and awesome God. 
05Dt 7:22 He slowly will dislodge these nations before you, but he will not destroy them quickly, so the wild animals won't multiply around you. 
05Dt 7:23 But the Lord your God will deliver them over to you, throwing them into great confusion until they are destroyed. 
05Dt 7:24 He will deliver kings into your control, and you will wipe out the memory of them from under heaven. No one will be able to stand before you. You are to utterly destroy them. 
05Dt 7:25 Burn the images of their gods in the fire. Desire neither the silver nor the gold that adorns them, nor take them for yourselves, so you won't be ensnared by them, because the gold and silver is detestable to the Lord your God.
05Dt 7:26 Do not bring any detestable thing to your house, because you yourself will be utterly destroyed along with these detestable things. You must absolutely abhor and detest all of it, because it has been devoted to destruction."
05Dt 8:1 "Be careful to observe every command that I'm instructing you today, in order that you may live, increase, and enter and take possession of the land that the Lord promised by an oath to your ancestors.
05Dt 8:2 "Remember how the Lord your God led you all the way these 40 years in the desert, to humble and test you in order to make known what was in your heart, whether or not you would keep his commands. 
05Dt 8:3 He humbled you, causing you to be hungry, yet he fed you with manna that neither you nor your ancestors had known, in order to teach you that human beings shall not live by food alone - instead human beings are to live by every word that proceeds from the mouth of the Lord.
05Dt 8:4 "The clothes you wore did not wear out, nor did your feet blister during these 40 years. 
05Dt 8:5 Be convinced in your heart that as a father disciplines his son, so the Lord your God disciplines you. 
05Dt 8:6 Observe the commands of the Lord your God by walking in his ways and by fearing him, 
05Dt 8:7 because the Lord your God is bringing you to a good land - a land with rivers and deep springs flowing to the valleys and hills. 
05Dt 8:8 It's a land filled with wheat, barley, vines, fig trees, and pomegranates. It's a land filled with olive oil and honey?
05Dt 8:9 a land without scarcity. You'll eat food in it and lack nothing. It's a land where its rocks are iron and you can dig copper from its mountains."
05Dt 8:10 "When you have eaten and are satisfied, bless the Lord your God for the good land that he has given you. 
05Dt 8:11 Be careful! Otherwise, you will forget the Lord your God by failing to keep his commands, ordinances, and statutes that I'm commanding you this day. 
05Dt 8:12 Otherwise, when you eat and are satisfied, when you have built beautiful houses and lived in them, 
05Dt 8:13 when your cattle and oxen multiply, when your silver and gold increase, 
05Dt 8:14 then you will become arrogant. You'll neglect the Lord your God, 
05Dt 8:15 who brought you out of the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery, and who led you through the vast and dangerous desert, that parched land without water, with its poisonous snakes and scorpions. He brought water out of solid rock for you, 
05Dt 8:16 and fed you in the desert with manna that neither you nor your ancestors had known, to humble and test you so that things go well with you later.812
05Dt 8:17 "You may say to yourselves, 'I have become wealthy by my own strength and by my own ability.' 
05Dt 8:18 But remember the Lord your God, because he is the one who gives you the ability to produce wealth, in order to confirm his covenant that he promised by an oath to your ancestors, as is the case today. 
05Dt 8:19 If you neglect the Lord your God, follow other gods, and serve and worship them, I testify to you today that you will certainly be destroyed. 
05Dt 8:20 Just like the nations whom the Lord destroyed before you, so will you be destroyed, because you did not listen to the voice of the Lord your God."
05Dt 9:1 "Listen, Israel! Today you are about to cross the Jordan to enter and dispossess greater and mightier nations than you, who live in large cities that are fortified to the sky. 
05Dt 9:2 The Anakim are strong and tall, and you know them. You've heard it said, 'Who can stand up against the Anakim?' 
05Dt 9:3 But know today that the Lord your God is going ahead of you as a consuming fire. He will destroy and subdue them before you. He will dispossess and destroy them quickly, just as the Lord told you. 
05Dt 9:4 After the Lord has expelled them before you, you are not to say to yourselves, 'The Lord caused me to enter and possess this land because of my righteousness.' 
05Dt 9:5 On the contrary, it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is dispossessing them before you to confirm what the Lord promised by an oath to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
05Dt 9:6 Know that it is not because of your righteousness that the Lord your God is giving to you this good land to inherit, for you are a stubborn people."
05Dt 9:7 "Remember - and don't ever forget - how you provoked the Lord your God in the desert. From the day that you came out of the land of Egypt until you came to this place you have been rebelling against the Lord. 
05Dt 9:8 At Horeb you continuously rebelled against the Lord, so that he was angry enough to destroy you.
05Dt 9:9 "Then I went up to the mountain to receive the two stone tablets of the covenant that the Lord had established with you. I stayed on the mountain for 40 days and nights without eating food or drinking water. 
05Dt 9:10 Then the Lord gave me the two stone tablets on which God inscribed with his own finger all the words that the Lord spoke to you on the mountain from the middle of the fire that day when you were all assembled together. 
05Dt 9:11 At the end of 40 days and nights, the Lord gave to me the two stone tablets of the covenant.
05Dt 9:12 "Then the Lord said to me, 'Get going! Go down from here at once! Your people whom you brought out of Egypt have become corrupt. They have turned quickly from the way that I commanded them, and have cast an idol for their use.'
05Dt 9:13 "Then the Lord said to me, 'I have examined this people, and they are stubborn indeed. 
05Dt 9:14 Let me alone! I will destroy them and blot out their name under heaven. Then I'll make you into a nation that will be mighty and more numerous than they are.' 
05Dt 9:15 "So I turned and went down from the mountain while the mountain was on fire. The two tablets of the covenant were in both of my hands. 
05Dt 9:16 Then I saw how you had really sinned against the Lord your God! You had made for yourselves a calf, a cast idol. You had turned aside quickly from the way that the Lord your God had commanded. 
05Dt 9:17 So I grabbed the two tablets and then threw them out of my hands, breaking them before your eyes. 
05Dt 9:18 I fell down in the Lord's presence, just as I had the first 40 days and nights. I did not eat food or drink water because of your sin. You had sinned by committing this evil in the sight of the Lord, thereby provoking him to anger. 
05Dt 9:19 I feared the anger and wrath of the Lord against you, because he was irate enough to destroy you. But the Lord also listened to me at that time. 
05Dt 9:20 It was as had been the case with Aaron, the Lord was very angry and about to destroy him, but I prayed for Aaron at that time. 
05Dt 9:21 Now, when you made the calf that made you sin, I grabbed it, burned it with fire, crushed it, and ground it thoroughly until it was pulverized to powder. Then I threw the powder into the river that was flowing from the mountain."18
05Dt 9:22 "You provoked the Lord again at Taberah, Massah, and Kibroth-hattaavah. 
05Dt 9:23 When the Lord sent you from Kadesh Barnea and told you, 'Go possess the land that I gave you,' instead you disobeyed what the Lord your God said. You didn't trust him or listen to his voice. 
05Dt 9:24 You have been rebelling against the Lord since the day I knew you. 
05Dt 9:25 I fell down in the Lord's presence for 40 days and nights, because the Lord said he was ready to destroy you. 
05Dt 9:26 So I prayed to the Lord and said, 'Oh Lord my God, don't destroy your people and your inheritance whom you redeemed by your power. You brought them out from Egypt in a powerful way. 
05Dt 9:27 Remember your servants Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. Don't pay attention to the stubbornness, wickedness, and sinfulness of this people. 
05Dt 9:28 Otherwise, the people of the land from which you brought us will say, "The Lord wasn't able to bring them out of the land that he had promised them. So he brought them out to kill them in the desert because he hated them." 
05Dt 9:29 But they are your people and inheritance, whom you brought out by your mighty strength and awesome power.'"927
05Dt 10:1 "At that time, the Lord said to me, 'Chisel two tablets of stone for yourself just like the first ones, and then come up to me on the mountain. Also make for yourself a wooden chest. 
05Dt 10:2 I'll write on the tablets what was on the first tablets that you broke. Then place them in the wooden chest.' 
05Dt 10:3 So I made a chest out of acacia wood and chiseled two tablets of stones just like the first ones. Then I went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hands. 
05Dt 10:4 Then the Lord inscribed on the tablets what he wrote before, that is, the Ten Commandments that the Lord declared to you on the mountain from the middle of the fire during the day of the assembly. And the Lord gave them to me. 
05Dt 10:5 Then I turned and went down the mountain and placed the tablets in the chest that I had made. They are there now, just as the Lord commanded me."
05Dt 10:6 "The Israelites traveled from the wells of the Jaakanites to Moserah. Aaron died, and he was buried there. His son Eleazar succeeded him as priest. 
05Dt 10:7 From there they moved on to Gudgodah and from Gudgodah to Jothbathah, a land with flowing streams. 
05Dt 10:8 At that time the Lord set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the covenant ark of the Lord, to stand in the Lord's presence, to serve, and to bless his name until this day. 
05Dt 10:9 That is why the Levites do not have a portion and an inheritance among their relatives. As for the Lord, he is their inheritance, just as the Lord your God told them. 
05Dt 10:10 When I stood on the mountain for 40 days and 40 nights as I did the first time, the Lord listened to me once again. The Lord was not willing to destroy you. 
05Dt 10:11 So the Lord said to me, 'Get up and proceed to lead the people, so they may enter and take possession of the land that I promised to give their ancestors by an oath.'" 
05Dt 10:12 "Now Israel, what does the Lord your God desire from you?Only this£º fear him, walk in all his ways, love him, serve him with all your heart and in all your life, 
05Dt 10:13 and observe his commands and statutes that I'm commanding you today for your own good. 
05Dt 10:14 You see, heaven - even the highest heavens - belongs to the Lord, along with the earth and all that is in it, 
05Dt 10:15 yet the Lord committed himself to love your ancestors - and did so! He chose you - their descendants after them - from all the nations, as it is today. 
05Dt 10:16 Therefore, circumcise your heart and stop being stubborn. 
05Dt 10:17 For the Lord your God is the God of all gods, the Lord of all lords, the great God, mighty and awesome, who does not show favoritism or take bribes. 
05Dt 10:18 He executes justice for the orphan and the widows, loves the foreigner, and gives them food and clothing."1017
05Dt 10:19 "You are to love the foreigner, because you were foreigners in the land of Egypt. 
05Dt 10:20 You are to fear the Lord your God and serve him. Cling to him and swear by his name. 
05Dt 10:21 He is the one you are to praise, because he is, your God who carried out those great and awesome things for you that you witnessed. 
05Dt 10:22 Your ancestors went down to Egypt with seventy people, but the Lord your God has now made you as numerous as the stars in the sky."
05Dt 11:1 "Therefore love the Lord your God and be very careful to keep his injunctions, statutes, ordinances, and commands all the time. 
05Dt 11:2 Keep in mind today that I am not speaking to your children, who neither were aware of nor did they witness the discipline of the Lord your God, that is, his great and far-reaching power, 
05Dt 11:3 including£º the signs and works that he did within Egypt to Pharaoh king of Egypt and to all his land; 
05Dt 11:4 what he did to the Egyptian army, its horses and chariots, when he caused the waters of the Reed Sea to engulf them as they pursued you; how the Lord destroyed them, even to this day; 
05Dt 11:5 what he did for you in the desert until you came to this place; 
05Dt 11:6 and what he did to Eliab's sons Dathan and Abiram, descendants of Reuben, when the ground opened up and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing belonging to them in the full sight of Israel. 
05Dt 11:7 Your very own eyes saw all the great things that the Lord did."
05Dt 11:8 "Keep all the commands that I'm giving you today, so you can be strong enough to enter and possess the land that you are crossing over to inherit 
05Dt 11:9 and so you'll live long in the land that the Lord your God promised by an oath to give your ancestors and their descendants, a land flowing with milk and honey. 
05Dt 11:10 For the land that you are about to enter to inherit isn't like the land of Egypt that you just left, where you plant a seed and irrigate it with your feet like a vegetable garden. 
05Dt 11:11 Instead, the land that you are crossing over to inherit is a land of hills and valleys that drinks water supplied by rain from heaven, 
05Dt 11:12 a land about which the Lord your God is continually concerned, because the eyes of the Lord rest continually on it throughout the entire year.10
05Dt 11:13 "If you carefully observe the commands that I'm giving you today, to love the Lord your God and serve him with all your heart and soul, 
05Dt 11:14 then he will send rain on the land in its season - the early and latter rains - then you'll gather grain, new wine, and oil. 
05Dt 11:15 He will provide grass on the fields for your livestock, and you'll eat and be satisfied. 
05Dt 11:16 Be careful! Otherwise, your hearts will deceive you and you will turn away to serve other gods and worship them. 
05Dt 11:17 The wrath of God will burn against you so that he will restrain the heavens and it won't rain. The ground won't yield its produce and you'll be swiftly destroyed from the good land that the Lord is about to give you.
05Dt 11:18 "Take these commands to heart and keep them in mind, tying them as reminders on your arm and as bands on your forehead. 
05Dt 11:19 Teach them to your children, talking about them while sitting in your house, walking on the road, or when you are about to lie down or get up. 
05Dt 11:20 Also write them upon the doorposts of your house and gates 
05Dt 11:21 so that you and your children may live long on the land that the Lord promised to give your ancestors - as long as the sky remains above the earth."
05Dt 11:22 "If you carefully observe all of these commands that I'm giving you to do - to love the Lord your God, to walk in all his ways, and to cling to him, 
05Dt 11:23 then the Lord will dispossess all these nations before you and you'll dispossess nations that are even greater and stronger than you. 
05Dt 11:24 Every place upon which the soles of your feet tread will be yours as boundaries - from the desert to Lebanon and from the River (that is, the Euphrates) to the Mediterranean Sea. 
05Dt 11:25 No one will be able to stand against you. The Lord your God will instill terror and fear of you throughout the entire land wherever you go, just as he promised you. 
05Dt 11:26 Look! I'm about to grant you a blessing and a curse?
05Dt 11:27 a blessing if you obey the commands of the Lord your God that I'm giving you today, 
05Dt 11:28 or a curse if you don't obey the commands of the Lord your God, by turning from the way that I'm commanding you today and following other gods whom you have not known." 11
05Dt 11:29 "When the Lord brings you to the land that you are about to enter to inherit, repeat the blessings on Mount Gerizim and the curses on Mount Ebal. 
05Dt 11:30 They're across the Jordan River to the west, aren't they, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah opposite Gilgal near the Oak of Moreh?
05Dt 11:31 For you are about to cross the Jordan River to go in and possess the land that the Lord your God is about to give you to inherit and live in. 
05Dt 11:32 Be careful to obey all the statutes and ordinances that I'm placing before you today."
05Dt 12:1 "These are the statutes and ordinances that you must carefully observe in the land that the Lord God of your ancestors has given you to possess every day that you live on the earth. 
05Dt 12:2 Be sure you destroy there all the places where the nations that you're going to dispossess serve their gods - upon the high mountains and hills and under every leafy tree. 
05Dt 12:3 Tear down their altars, cut down their sacred poles, and burn them. Cut down the carved images of their gods to erase their memory from that place."
05Dt 12:4 "You must not act like this with respect to the Lord your God. 
05Dt 12:5 Instead, you must seek to enter only the place that the Lord your God will choose among your tribes. There he will establish his name and live. 
05Dt 12:6 Bring your burnt offerings there, along with your sacrifices, your tithes, your hand-carried gifts, your votive offerings, your freely given offerings, and the first born of your herds and flocks. 
05Dt 12:7 Then you and your household will eat in the presence of the Lord your God and rejoice with all the works of your hand with which he blessed you.
05Dt 12:8 "You must not act as we have been doing here today, where every one acts as they see fit, 
05Dt 12:9 for you haven't arrived yet to your allotted place that the Lord your God is about to give you. 
05Dt 12:10 But after you have crossed the Jordan River and settled in the land that the Lord your God is giving you to inherit, and after you have received relief from the enemies around you and are living securely, 
05Dt 12:11 then bring to the place that the Lord your God will choose as a dwelling place - where he will establish his name - everything that I'm commanding you£º your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, your hand-carried gifts, all your best votive offerings that you pledged to the Lord.
05Dt 12:12 "Rejoice in the presence of the Lord your God - you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is in your city - for there is no territorial allotment for him as you have. 
05Dt 12:13 Be careful not to offer burnt offerings at any location you happen to see 
05Dt 12:14 instead of at the place the Lord will choose in one of the tribal areas. There you may offer burnt offerings, and there you may do everything that I'm commanding you."12
05Dt 12:15 "You may slaughter and eat as much meat as you desire, according to the blessing of the Lord your God, when he provides for you in all your cities. Both ritually unqualified and qualified people may eat it as they would gazelle and deer. 
05Dt 12:16 Only, you must not consume the blood; instead, pour it out on the ground as you would water.
05Dt 12:17 "You won't be allowed to eat your tithe of grain, new wine, oil, the first born of your herd and flock, your votive offerings that you pledged, your free-will offerings, and the works of your hands in your own cities. 
05Dt 12:18 You'll eat only in the presence of the Lord your God at the place that he will choose - you, your sons and your daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levite who is in your cities. Rejoice in the presence of the Lord your God in everything you undertake. 
05Dt 12:19 Be careful not to forget the Levite while you live in the land. 
05Dt 12:20 When the Lord your God enlarges your territory - just as he told you - and you say 'I want to eat meat' since you desire to eat it, you may do so as much as you please.18
05Dt 12:21 "If the place where the Lord your God chooses to establish his name is distant from you, then you may slaughter from your herd and your flock what the Lord has provided for you, as he instructed you. You may consume them in your cities as much as you please. 
05Dt 12:22 You may eat them, just as you would gazelle and deer. Ritually unqualified and qualified people may eat them. 
05Dt 12:23 Only be sure to refrain from eating blood, because blood is the source of life and you must not consume blood with the meat. 
05Dt 12:24 You must not consume it; instead, pour it on the ground as you would water. 
05Dt 12:25 You must not eat it, so that life will go well for you and for your children after you. Then you'll do what is right in the eyes of the Lord.
05Dt 12:26 "You may carry and bring only your consecrated gifts and votive offerings to the place that the Lord will choose. 
05Dt 12:27 You must offer your burnt offerings, both the meat and the blood, on the altar of the Lord your God. You must offer the blood by pouring it on the altar of the Lord your God while you consume the meat. 
05Dt 12:28 Be sure to observe all these words that I'm commanding you, in order that life may go well for you and your children after you forever, for this is good and right in the eyes of the Lord your God."
05Dt 12:29 "When the Lord your God eliminates the nations that you are about to dispossess so you can live in their land, 
05Dt 12:30 after they have been destroyed in your sight, be careful not to be ensnared as they were. Otherwise, you will seek their gods and ask yourselves, 'How do these nations serve their gods?I will do likewise.' 
05Dt 12:31 You must not do the same to the Lord your God, because they practiced in the presence of their gods every sort of abomination that the Lord hates. Moreover, they sacrificed their sons and daughters to their gods. 
05Dt 12:32 Now as to everything I'm commanding you, you must be careful to observe it. Don't add to or subtract from it."
05Dt 13:1 "A prophet or a diviner of dreams may arise among you, give you an omen or a miracle 
05Dt 13:2 that takes place, and then he may tell you, 'Let's follow other gods (whom you have not known) and let's serve them.' Even though the sign or portent comes to pass, 
05Dt 13:3 you must not listen to the words of that prophet or that diviner of dreams. For the Lord your God is testing you, to make known whether or not you'll continue to love the Lord your God with all your heart and soul. 
05Dt 13:4 You must follow the Lord your God, fear him, observe his commandments, listen to his voice, serve him, and cling to him. 
05Dt 13:5 That prophet or diviner of dreams must be executed, because he advocated rebellion against the Lord your God, who brought you from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, and because he lured you from the way in which the Lord your God instructed you to live. Purge the evil from among you."
05Dt 13:6 "Your own blood brother, your son, your daughter, your beloved wife, or your friend who is like your soul mate quietly may entice you. He may tell you, 'Let's go and serve other gods,' (whom neither you nor your ancestors have known 
05Dt 13:7 from the gods of the people that surround you - whether near or far from you - from one end of the earth to the other). 
05Dt 13:8 You must not yield to him, listen to him, look with pity on him, show compassion to him, or even cover up for him. 
05Dt 13:9 But you must surely execute him. You must be the first to put him to death with your own hand, and then the hands of the whole community. 
05Dt 13:10 Stone him to death, because he sought to lure you from the Lord your God who brought you from the land of Egypt, from the land of slavery. 
05Dt 13:11 Then all Israel will hear about it, be afraid, and won't do this evil thing again among you.10
05Dt 13:12 "You may hear in one of your towns that the Lord your God is giving you to inhabit 
05Dt 13:13 that worthless men have come from among you to entice those who live in the towns. They may say, 'Let's go and serve other gods that you haven't known.' 
05Dt 13:14 You must thoroughly investigate and inquire if it is true that this detestable thing exists among you. If it is so, 
05Dt 13:15 then put the inhabitants of the town to death by the sword. Devote everything in it to divine destruction - even its livestock - by the sword. 
05Dt 13:16 Gather whatever you've taken as spoils at the public square of the town, then burn the town, along with whatever you've taken, as an offering to the Lord your God. It will remain a tel forever, never to be rebuilt again. 
05Dt 13:17 Moreover, you must never take any item from those condemned things, so the Lord may yet relent from his burning anger and extend compassion, have mercy, and cause you to increase in number - as he promised by an oath to your ancestors?
05Dt 13:18 if you obey the voice of the Lord your God by observing all his commands that I'm commanding you today. Do what is right in the sight of the Lord your God."1313
05Dt 14:1 "You are children of the Lord your God. You must not lacerate yourselves or shave your foreheads on account of the dead, 
05Dt 14:2 because you are a holy people to the Lord your God, and the Lord chose to make you his precious possession from among all the peoples of the earth.
05Dt 14:3 "You must not eat any detestable food. 
05Dt 14:4 These are the animals that you may eat£º ox, sheep, goat, 
05Dt 14:5 deer, gazelle, roebuck, wild goat, ibex, antelope, and mountain sheep. 
05Dt 14:6 You may eat every animal with a divided hoof - those with split cloven hooves - that chews the cud. 
05Dt 14:7 However, you must not eat these animals that chew the cud or have a divided hoof£º the camel, hare, and rock badger. Even though they chew the cud, their hooves are not divided. Therefore they are unclean for you. 
05Dt 14:8 And also the pig, because even though its hoof is divided, it does not chew the cud. It is therefore unclean for you. You must not eat their meat or even touch their carcasses.
05Dt 14:9 "You may choose to eat from these creatures in the water£º you may eat anything with fin and scale, 
05Dt 14:10 but you may not eat anything without fin and scale, since it is unclean to you.
05Dt 14:11 "You may eat all clean birds. 
05Dt 14:12 But you must not eat from any of these£º the eagle, vulture, osprey, 
05Dt 14:13 buzzard, any kind of kite, 
05Dt 14:14 any kind of raven, 
05Dt 14:15 the ostrich, night hawk, seagull, any kind of falcon, 
05Dt 14:16 the little owl, the great owl, the horned owl, 
05Dt 14:17 the pelican, the carrion vulture, the cormorant, 
05Dt 14:18 the stork, any kind of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat. 
05Dt 14:19 Any winged, swarming insect is unclean to you. They must not be eaten. 
05Dt 14:20 You may eat every bird that is clean.
05Dt 14:21 "You must not eat any carcass. But you may give it to the alien in your cities so he may eat it or sell it to a foreigner, for you are a holy people to the Lord your God. "You must not cook a young goat in its mother's milk."
05Dt 14:22 "Be sure to tithe annually from everything you plant that yields a harvest in the field. 
05Dt 14:23 Then in the presence of the Lord your God, in the place where he'll choose to establish his name, you may consume the tithe of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the first born of your livestock and flock, so that you'll learn to revere the Lord your God all your life. 
05Dt 14:24 Now the way may be distant from you, so that you are unable to transport your tithe because you have been blessed by the Lord your God and the place where the Lord your God chooses to establish his name may be distant from you. 
05Dt 14:25 In that case, convert it into cash, secure the money, and then bring it to the place where the Lord will choose. 
05Dt 14:26 You may spend the money to your heart's content to buy livestock, flocks, wine, strong drink, and whatever you desire. You and your household may eat there and rejoice in the presence of the Lord your God."
05Dt 14:27 "But you must not forget the Levite in your town because there is no tribal allotment for him as there is for you. 
05Dt 14:28 Every third year, bring all the tithes of your produce of that year and store it in your cities 
05Dt 14:29 so the Levites - who have no tribal allotment as you do - foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your cities may come, eat, and be satisfied. That way, the Lord your God shall bless you in everything you do."
05Dt 15:1 "You must cancel your debts at the end of every seventh year. 
05Dt 15:2 This is the way to conduct remission£º every creditor must cancel the loan that his friend borrowed, and he must not pressure his friend or brother to repay it, because remission to the Lord will be proclaimed. 
05Dt 15:3 You may exact payment from a foreigner, but cancel whatever your brother owes you.
05Dt 15:4 "Moreover, there will be no poor person among you, for the Lord will surely bless you in the land that he is about to give you to possess. 
05Dt 15:5 Only be certain to obey the voice of the Lord your God. Carefully observe all of these commands that I'm commanding to you today. 
05Dt 15:6 For the Lord your God will bless you just as he promised. You are to lend to many nations but not borrow. Also, you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you."4
05Dt 15:7 "If there should be a poor man among your relatives in one of the cities of the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, don't be hard-hearted or tight-fisted toward your poor relative. 
05Dt 15:8 Instead, be sure to open your hand to him and lend him enough to lessen his need.
05Dt 15:9 "Be careful not to think this wicked thought to yourselves£º 'The seventh year, the year of remission, is drawing near,' and you show ill will toward your poor relative and not give to him. He may then call to the Lord on account of you, and you will be guilty of sin. 
05Dt 15:10 You must certainly give to him and not feel regret for doing so. Because of this, the Lord your God will bless all your works and everything you do. 
05Dt 15:11 Since poor people won't cease to exist in the land, therefore I'm commanding you£º Be sure to be generous to your poor and needy relatives in your land."
05Dt 15:12 "When a fellow Hebrew male or female slave is sold to you and serves you for six years, then in the seventh year you are to set them free. 
05Dt 15:13 But when you set them free, don't send them away empty-handed. 
05Dt 15:14 Provide for them liberally from your flock, threshing floor, and wine vat. As the Lord your God has blessed you, so give to them. 
05Dt 15:15 Don't ever forget that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, yet the Lord your God redeemed you. Therefore, I'm giving you these commands today.
05Dt 15:16 "Should that slave say to you, 'I won't leave you,' because he loves you and your household, and it was good for him to be with you, 
05Dt 15:17 then take an awl and pierce through his earlobe into the door. Then he will be your slave forever. You may do the same for your female slaves. 
05Dt 15:18 Don't view this as a hardship for yourself when you set him free, for he will have served you for six years - twice the time of a paid worker. Then the Lord will bless you in all that you do."
05Dt 15:19 "Set apart for the Lord your God every firstborn male among your herd and flock. You must not put the firstborn of your ox to work or shear the firstborn of your flock. 
05Dt 15:20 Then in the presence of the Lord your God, you and your household must eat them every year at the place the Lord will choose. 
05Dt 15:21 If it has a blemish - lameness, blindness, or any kind of defect - you must not sacrifice it to the Lord your God. 
05Dt 15:22 In your cities both the unclean and the clean together are to eat together, as the gazelle and the deer. 23Only you must not eat its blood. Pour it on the ground like water."
05Dt 16:1 "Observe the month of Abib, keeping the Passover to the Lord your God, because the Lord your God brought you out of Egypt during the night in the month of Abib. 
05Dt 16:2 Then sacrifice sheep and cattle for the Passover to the Lord your God at the place where the Lord your God will choose to establish his name. 
05Dt 16:3 You must not eat any yeast with it. Instead, for seven days eat bread without yeast - the bread of affliction - because you left the land of Egypt in haste. Remember the day you went out of the land of Egypt for the rest of your lives. 
05Dt 16:4 Yeast is not to be seen in any of your territories for seven days. The meat shall not remain from the evening of the first day until morning.2
05Dt 16:5 "You must not sacrifice the Passover in just any of your cities that the Lord your God is about to give you. 
05Dt 16:6 But at the place where your God will choose to establish his name, you are to sacrifice the Passover in the evening at dusk, at the time of day you left Egypt. 
05Dt 16:7 Boil and eat the Passover meal at the place that Lord your God will choose. In the morning you may go back to your tents. 
05Dt 16:8 Eat bread without yeast for six days. Then on the seventh day, hold an assembly to the Lord your God. Don't do any work."
05Dt 16:9 "Count off seven weeks from when the sickle is first put to standing grain. 
05Dt 16:10 Then observe the Feast of Weeks in the presence of the Lord your God by giving your tribute and the freewill offering of your hands in proportion to the manner in which the Lord your God blessed you.
05Dt 16:11 Rejoice in the presence of the Lord your God with your son, daughter, male and female slaves, the Levite who is in your city, the stranger, the orphan, and the widow among you, at the place where the Lord your God will choose to establish his name. 
05Dt 16:12 Remember that you were slaves in Egypt, so keep and observe these statutes."
05Dt 16:13 "Celebrate the Feast of Tabernacles for seven days after you harvest from your threshing floor and your wine press. 
05Dt 16:14 Rejoice in your festival - you, your son, your daughter, your male and female slaves, the Levites, foreigners, orphans, and widows who live in your cities. 
05Dt 16:15 For seven days you are to celebrate in the presence of the Lord your God at the place where the Lord will choose; for the Lord your God will bless you in all your harvest and in everything you do, and your joy will be complete.1614
05Dt 16:16 "Every male must appear in the presence of the Lord your God three times a year at the place where he will choose£º for the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Seven Weeks, and the Feast of Tabernacles. He must not appear in the Lord's presence empty-handed, 
05Dt 16:17 but each one must appear with his own gift, proportional to the blessing that the Lord your God has given you."16
05Dt 16:18 "Appoint judges and civil servants according to your tribes in all your cities that the Lord your God is about to give you, so they may judge the people impartially. 
05Dt 16:19 You must not twist justice, show favoritism, or take bribes, because a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and subverts the speech of the righteous. 
05Dt 16:20 You are to pursue justice - and only justice - so you may live and possess the land that the Lord your God is about to give you.
05Dt 16:21 "You are not to set up a sacred pole beside the altar of the Lord your God that you will build. 
05Dt 16:22 Furthermore, you are not to erect for yourselves a sacred stone pillar, because the Lord your God detests these things. 
05Dt 17:1 You are not to sacrifice to the Lord your God an ox and a sheep that has a defect or any flaw it, because that is detestable to the Lord your God."16
05Dt 17:2 "You may discover that a man or woman living in one of your cities that the Lord your God is about to give you has done evil in the eyes of the Lord your God by transgressing his covenant. 
05Dt 17:3 He may be following and serving other gods by bowing down to them - that is, to the sun, the moon, or to any of the heavenly host (something I did not command). 
05Dt 17:4 When it is reported to you or you hear of it, then investigate it thoroughly. When the truth has been established that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, 
05Dt 17:5 summon the man or the woman who did this evil thing to your city gates. Then stone the man or the woman to death. 
05Dt 17:6 Based on the testimony of two or three witnesses, they must surely die. But they are not to die based on the testimony of one person. 
05Dt 17:7 Let the witnesses be the first to begin executing them, then the rest of the people shall follow. By doing this you will purge evil from among you."5
05Dt 17:8 "If a case is too difficult for you to decide with respect to bloodshed, civil claims, assault and battery, or other matters of dispute within your courts, bring it to the place that the Lord your God will choose. 
05Dt 17:9 Present the case to the Levitical priest or the judge at that time. When you have inquired and they have announced the verdict, 
05Dt 17:10 carry out the verdict that was declared to you at the place that the Lord will choose. Carefully observe all of their instructions to you 
05Dt 17:11 in accordance with what the Law says, and in accordance with the verdict that will be handed to you. You must not deviate from the verdict that they declare to you either to the right or to the left.
05Dt 17:12 "If a man presumptuously disregards the priest who is serving the Lord your God there or the judge, that person must die so you will purge evil from Israel. 
05Dt 17:13 Then all the people who hear will be afraid and will not act presumptuously again."
05Dt 17:14 "When you have come to the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, and you have taken possession of it, and have settled in it, then you will say, 'I will appoint a king over me like all the nations around me.' 
05Dt 17:15 You will certainly set a king over you, whom the Lord your God will choose from among your relatives, but you must not place a foreign king over you who is not from your relatives. 
05Dt 17:16 Only he must not amass horses for himself or cause the people to return to Egypt to obtain more horses. For the Lord said you must never return that way again. 
05Dt 17:17 Also, he must not accumulate wives for himself (otherwise, his affection will become diverted), nor accumulate for himself excessive quantities of silver and gold. 
05Dt 17:18 When he occupies his royal throne, he must make a copy of this Law for himself from a scroll used by the Levitical priests. 
05Dt 17:19 It shall remain with him the rest of his life so he may learn to fear the Lord his God and observe all the words of this Law and these statutes, in order to fulfill them. 
05Dt 17:20 He is not to exalt himself over his relatives, nor turn aside from the commandment - neither to the right nor to the left - so that he and his sons may reign long in Israel."
05Dt 18:1 "The Levitical priests, the whole tribe of Levi, will not have a portion or an inheritance within Israel. Instead, they will eat the burnt offerings of the Lord, because that is their inheritance. 
05Dt 18:2 But they will not have an inheritance among their relatives, because the Lord alone is their inheritance - as he promised them."
05Dt 18:3 "A portion of what the people offer in sacrifice, whether cattle or sheep, shall be due the priests. They must set aside the shoulder, jowls, and stomach for the priest. 
05Dt 18:4 Give them the first gatherings of your grain, wine, oil, and wool from the shearing of your flock. 
05Dt 18:5 For the Lord your God has chosen them and their descendants from among your tribes to stand and serve in the name of the Lord all their lives."
05Dt 18:6 "Any Levite who wishes to do so may come from any city or part of Israel where he resides to the place that the Lord will choose. 
05Dt 18:7 There he may serve in the name of the Lord his God. Like his fellow Levites who stand there in the Lord's presence, 
05Dt 18:8 he may eat the same share as they do regardless of what he receives from his ancestral estate."
05Dt 18:9 "When you enter the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, don't learn the detestable practices of those nations there. 
05Dt 18:10 There must never be found among you anyone who sacrifices his son or daughter in fire, practices divination, interprets omens, practices sorcery, 
05Dt 18:11 casts spells, or who is a medium, an occultist, or a necromancer. 
05Dt 18:12 Whoever practices these things is detestable to the Lord, and the Lord your God will expel them before you because of these things. 
05Dt 18:13 You must be completely faithful to the Lord your God, 
05Dt 18:14 because those nations that you are about to dispossess listen to those who practice witchcraft and divination. But the Lord does not allow you to act this way."1810
05Dt 18:15 "The Lord your God will raise up a prophet like me for you from among your relatives. You must listen to him. 
05Dt 18:16 For this is what you asked from the Lord your God at Horeb when you were assembled together£º 'Don't let us hear the voice of the Lord our God again, or even see this great fire - otherwise, we will die.'
05Dt 18:17 "Then the Lord said to me£º 'What they have suggested is good. 
05Dt 18:18 I will raise up a prophet like you from among their relatives, and I will place my words in his mouth so that he may expound everything that I have commanded to them. 
05Dt 18:19 But if someone will not listen to those words that the prophet speaks in my name, I will hold him accountable. 
05Dt 18:20 Even then, if the prophet speaks presumptuously in my name, which I didn't authorize him to speak, or if he speaks in the name of other gods, that prophet must die.' 
05Dt 18:21 Now you may ask yourselves, 'How will we be able to discern that the Lord has not spoken?' 
05Dt 18:22 Whenever a prophet speaks in the name of the Lord, and the oracle does not come about or the word is not fulfilled, then the Lord has not spoken it. The prophet will have spoken presumptuously, so you need not fear him."
05Dt 19:1 "When the Lord your God destroys those nations whose lands he is about to give you, you must dispossess them and live in their cities and houses. 
05Dt 19:2 You must reserve three cities within the land that the Lord your God is about to give you to possess. 
05Dt 19:3 Build roads throughout the land that the Lord your God is providing as an inheritance, and then divide it into three districts so that any killer may flee there.
05Dt 19:4 "Now this is the situation for any killer who flees there to live£º suppose he strikes his friend unwittingly, not having hated him previously. 
05Dt 19:5 For instance, he may have accompanied his friend to go to a forest to cut trees. Then he swung his axe to cut some wood, but the ax head flew off the handle and hit his friend, so that he died. The killer may flee to one of these cities to live. 
05Dt 19:6 While the distance may be great and the angry avenger pursues the killer, he may overtake him and kill him, in which case there will be no justice in his death, because he did not hate his friend previously. 
05Dt 19:7 Therefore I am commanding you to reserve three cities."
05Dt 19:8 "Now if the Lord enlarges your territories just as he promised your ancestors and gives you all the land that he promised, 
05Dt 19:9 and if you are careful to observe all these commands that I am commanding you today - to love the Lord your God and to walk daily in his ways - then add three more cities in addition to these three cities. 
05Dt 19:10 You must not shed innocent blood on your land that the Lord your God is about to give you as an inheritance. Otherwise, you'll be guilty of murder."
05Dt 19:11 "However, if a person hates his neighbor, lies in wait for him, rises up against him, and attacks him so that he dies, and then he flees to one of those cities, 
05Dt 19:12 then the elders of his own city shall send for him, remove him from there, and deliver him to the related avenger for execution. 
05Dt 19:13 Have no pity on him, but totally purge the shedding of innocent blood from Israel so that life may go well with you.12
05Dt 19:14 "When you inherit the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, don't move your neighbor's boundary marker from where it was placed long ago."
05Dt 19:15 "The testimony of one person alone shall not suffice to convict anyone of any inequity, sin, or guilt. But the matter will stand on the testimony of two or three witnesses. 
05Dt 19:16 When a malicious witness takes the stand against a man and accuses him, 
05Dt 19:17 then both must stand with their dispute in the Lord's presence, the priests, and the judges at that time. 
05Dt 19:18 The judges will investigate thoroughly. If the false witness lies in testifying against his relative, 
05Dt 19:19 do to him just as he intended to do to his relative. By doing this you will purge evil from your midst. 
05Dt 19:20 When others hear of this, they will be afraid and will not do such an evil deed again in your midst. 
05Dt 19:21 Your eyes must not show pity - life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, and foot for foot."1916
05Dt 20:1 "When you go to war against your enemies and observe more horses, chariots, and soldiers than you have, don't be afraid of them, for the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt is with you.
05Dt 20:2 "As you draw near for battle, let the priest approach and speak to the army. 
05Dt 20:3 He will say to them, 'Listen, Israel! You're about to go into battle today against your enemies. Don't be faint-hearted. Don't be afraid, don't panic, and don't be terrified to face them. 
05Dt 20:4 For the Lord your God will be with you, fighting on your behalf against your enemies in order to grant you victory.'
05Dt 20:5 "Furthermore, let the officials ask the army, 'Is there a man here who has built a new house but has not yet dedicated it?Let him go back home. Otherwise, he may die in battle and another man dedicate it.
05Dt 20:6 "'And is there a man here who has planted a vineyard and not yet benefited from it?Let him go home. Otherwise, he may die in battle and another man use it.
05Dt 20:7 "'And is there a man here who is engaged to a woman and has not yet married her?Let him go back home. Otherwise, he may die in battle and another man marry her.'
05Dt 20:8 "Let the officials also speak to the army, 'Is there a man here who is afraid and faint-hearted?Let him go back home. Otherwise, he may demoralize his fellow soldier.'
05Dt 20:9 "When the officials have finished speaking to the army, they must appoint officers to lead the troops."
05Dt 20:10 "When you approach a city to wage war against it, extend terms of peace. 
05Dt 20:11 If it agrees to peace and welcomes you, then all the people found in it will serve you as forced laborers. 
05Dt 20:12 But if they refuse to make peace with you and instead choose war, then attack it. 
05Dt 20:13 The Lord your God will deliver it into your control, and you must execute every male. 
05Dt 20:14 The women, children, all the livestock in the city, and all of the spoil and plunder will belong to you. Appropriate the spoil of your enemies, which the Lord your God will give you. 
05Dt 20:15 Do this to all the cities that are distant from you - that is, to those cities that are not in neighboring nations."2011
05Dt 20:16 "You are not to leave even one person alive in the cities of these nations that the Lord your God is about to give you as an inheritance. 
05Dt 20:17 You must completely destroy the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, just as the Lord your God commanded you, 
05Dt 20:18 so they won't teach you to do all the detestable things that they do for their gods. If you do what they teach you, you will sin against the Lord your God."
05Dt 20:19 "When you attack a city and have to fight against it for many days, don't destroy its trees by cutting them down with an ax. You may eat from them, but you must not cut them down. Are the trees of the field human beings, that you would come and attack them?
05Dt 20:20 However, you may cut down the trees whose fruit you know isn't edible, in order to build siege works against the city that waged war with you, until it falls."
05Dt 21:1 "If a murder victim is found fallen in the open country of the land that the Lord your God is about to give you to possess, and it is not known who killed him, 
05Dt 21:2 then let your elders and judges go out and measure the distance from the dead body to the neighboring cities. 
05Dt 21:3 Then the elders of the city nearest the body are to take a heifer that hasn't been put to work or hasn't pulled a yoke 
05Dt 21:4 and shall lead the heifer to a flowing stream in a valley that has never been tilled or planted. They shall break the heifer's neck there.
05Dt 21:5 "Then the priests of the sons of Levi will step forward, because the Lord your God chose them to serve and pronounce blessings in his name. Every case of dispute and assault shall be subject to their ruling. 
05Dt 21:6 All the elders of the city nearest the dead body shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley,
05Dt 21:7 and they are to make this declaration£º 'Our hands didn't shed this blood, nor were we witnesses to the crime. 
05Dt 21:8 Make atonement for your people Israel, whom you have redeemed, Lord, and don't charge the blood of an innocent man against them.' Then the blood shed will be atoned for. 
05Dt 21:9 This is how you will remove the guilt of innocent blood from among you, for you must do what is right in the sight of the Lord."8
05Dt 21:10 "If you go to battle against your enemies, and the Lord your God delivers them into your control, you may take some prisoners captive. 
05Dt 21:11 If you see among the prisoners a beautiful woman and you desire her, then you may take her as your wife. 
05Dt 21:12 Bring her to your house, but shave her head and trim her nails. 
05Dt 21:13 Remove her prisoner's clothing and let her remain for a month in your house, mourning her parents. After that, you may become her husband and she shall become your wife. 
05Dt 21:14 If you aren't pleased with her and you send her away, you must not sell her for money or mistreat her, since you have dishonored her."2111
05Dt 21:15 "If a man has two wives where one is loved but the other is unloved, and both of them bear him sons, but the firstborn is the son of the unloved wife, 
05Dt 21:16 then when he bequeaths his possessions to his sons, he must not give preference to the firstborn of the beloved wife over the firstborn of the unloved wife. 
05Dt 21:17 Instead, he must acknowledge the firstborn of the unloved wife by giving him double of everything he owns, because he is really the first fruit of his father's strength. The right of the firstborn belongs to him."
05Dt 21:18 "If a man has a stubborn son who does not obey his parents, and although they try to discipline him, he still refuses to pay attention to them, 
05Dt 21:19 then his parents shall seize him and bring him before the elders at the gate of his city. 
05Dt 21:20 Then they are to declare to the elders of their city£º 'Our son is stubborn and rebellious. He does not obey us. He lives wildly and is a drunkard.' 
05Dt 21:21 Then all the men of his city shall stone him with stones so that he dies. This is how you will remove this evil from among you. Then all Israel will hear of it and will be afraid."
05Dt 21:22 "If a man is guilty of a capital offense, is executed, and then is impaled on a tree, 
05Dt 21:23 his body must not remain overnight on the tree. You must bury him that same day, because cursed of God is the one who has been hanged on a tree. Don't defile your land that the Lord is about to give you as your inheritance."
05Dt 22:1 "When you see the ox or sheep of your fellow countryman straying, don't go away and leave them. Instead, be sure to return them to him. 
05Dt 22:2 If your fellow countryman doesn't live near you or you don't know who he is, bring the animal to your house and let it remain with you until he claims it. Then return it to him. 
05Dt 22:3 Do the same for his donkey, his garment, and for anything lost that belongs to your fellow countryman. When you find it, you must not ignore it. 
05Dt 22:4 When you see the donkey or the ox of your fellow countryman fallen on the road, don't ignore them. Instead be sure to help them get up."1
05Dt 22:5 "A woman must not wear what is appropriate to a man, nor shall a man put on a woman's garment, because anyone who does this is detestable to the Lord your God.
05Dt 22:6 "When you encounter a bird's nest along the road, whether in a tree or on the ground, and the mother bird is sitting on its chicks or eggs, don't take the mother along with its young. 
05Dt 22:7 You may take the young but be sure to release the mother, so that life will go well for you and that you may have a long life.
05Dt 22:8 "When you build a new house, install a parapet along your roof so that if someone falls from the roof, you won't bring guilt of bloodshed on your house."
05Dt 22:9 "Don't plant two kinds of seeds in your vineyard. Otherwise, the entire crop will have to be forfeited, both the seed that you have sown and the produce from it.
05Dt 22:10 "Don't plow with an ox and a donkey yoked together. 
05Dt 22:11 "Don't wear material made from wool and linen mixed together.
05Dt 22:12 "Sew tassels for yourselves on the four corners of the garment with which you cover yourself."
05Dt 22:13 "Suppose a man marries a wife but after having sexual relations with her, he despises her, 
05Dt 22:14 invents charges against her, and defames her by saying, 'I have married this woman, but when I had sexual relations with her I found that she wasn't a virgin.'
05Dt 22:15 "Then the father of the young lady, along with her mother, shall bring evidence of the young lady's virginity to the elders at the gate. 
05Dt 22:16 The father of the young lady shall then say to the elders£º 'I have given my daughter to this man as a wife, but he despises her. 
05Dt 22:17 Now look, he has invented charges against her by saying, "I haven't found your daughter to be a virgin." But here is the proof of my daughter's virginity.' Then they are to spread the cloth before the elders of the city.
05Dt 22:18 "The elders of that city will then take the man, punish him, 
05Dt 22:19 fine him 100 shekels of silver, and then give them to the young lady's father, because he had defamed a virgin of Israel. She shall remain his wife and he can't divorce her as long as he lives.22
05Dt 22:20 But if this charge is true, and the evidence of the young lady's virginity weren't found, 
05Dt 22:21 they are to bring her to the door of her father's house. Then the men of the city shall stone her with boulders until she dies for doing a detestable thing in Israel - acting like a prostitute while in her father's house. By doing this, you will remove this evil from among you.
05Dt 22:22 "If a man is caught having sexual relations with a married woman, then both of them must die - the man who had sex with the woman and the woman herself - so that this evil will be removed from Israel. 22
05Dt 22:23 "If a man meets a young virgin lady engaged to be married in the city and has sexual relations with her, 
05Dt 22:24 then the two must be brought to the city gate and there they must be stoned to death - the girl because she was in a city but did not cry out for help, and the man who abused a woman who was engaged to another man. By doing this you are to remove this evil from among you.
05Dt 22:25 "If a man meets a girl in the country who is engaged to be married and then rapes her, the man alone - the one who had sexual relations with her - must die. 
05Dt 22:26 As for the young lady, don't do anything to her. The young lady did nothing worthy of death. This case is similar to when a man attacks his countryman and kills him. 
05Dt 22:27 Since he found her in the country, the engaged girl may have cried out, but there was no one to rescue her.
05Dt 22:28 "However, if a man meets a girl who isn't engaged to be married, and he seizes her, rapes her, and is later found out, 
05Dt 22:29 then the man who raped her must give 50 shekels of silver to the girl's father. Furthermore, he must marry her. Because he had violated her, he shall not divorce her as long as he lives.
05Dt 22:30 "A man must not marry his father's wife, so that he will not dishonor his father's memory."
05Dt 23:1 "No man whose testicles have been crushed or whose penis has been cut off may participate in the assembly of the Lord. 
05Dt 23:2 Furthermore, no one born due to an illicit sexual relationship may participate in the assembly of the Lord, including his descendants to the tenth generation.1 
05Dt 23:3 "No Ammonite or Moabite may participate in the assembly of the Lord, and none of their descendants shall be admitted to the assembly of the Lord, to the tenth generation, 
05Dt 23:4 because they didn't come to meet you with food and water along the way as you were coming out of Egypt. Instead, they hired Beor's son Balaam from Pethor in Aram-naharaim to curse you. 
05Dt 23:5 However, the Lord your God didn't listen to Balaam. The Lord your God turned Balaam's curse into a blessing, because the Lord your God loves you. 
05Dt 23:6 Don't seek a peace treaty with them as long as you live.5
05Dt 23:7 "Don't detest Edomites, since they are related to you. Don't detest Egyptians, either, because you were strangers in their land. 
05Dt 23:8 Their grandchildren may participate in the assembly of the Lord."
05Dt 23:9 "When you are encamped for battle against your enemies, be on guard against every form of impropriety. 
05Dt 23:10 If someone among you becomes unclean due to nocturnal emissions, he must leave the camp and stay outside. 
05Dt 23:11 As evening approaches he must wash himself with water. Then at sunset, he may return to the camp.
05Dt 23:12 "Choose a place outside the camp for a latrine. 
05Dt 23:13 Include a spade among your equipment so that when you squat to relieve yourself, you can dig a hole and then cover your excrement. 
05Dt 23:14 For the Lord your God is on the move within your camp to deliver you and to hand your enemies over to you. Therefore your camp must be holy so that he will not see anything indecent among you and turn away from you."
05Dt 23:15 "Don't hand over a slave who escaped from his master when he runs to you. 
05Dt 23:16 Let him live among you wherever he chooses in any of your cities that he likes. Don't mistreat him."
05Dt 23:17 "There shall be no cultic prostitutes from among the daughters or the sons of Israel. 
05Dt 23:18 Don't bring the earnings of a female prostitute nor the income of a male prostitute into the house of the Lord your God as payment for any vow. Both of these are detestable to the Lord your God."
05Dt 23:19 "Don't charge interest to your relatives, whether for money, food, or for anything that has been loaned at interest. 
05Dt 23:20 You may charge interest to a foreigner, but don't charge interest to your relatives, so the Lord your God may bless you in everything you undertake in the land that you are about to enter and possess.
05Dt 23:21 "When you make a vow to the Lord your God, don't delay paying it, because the Lord your God will certainly demand payment from you, and then you will be guilty of sin. 
05Dt 23:22 But if you refrain from making a vow, then you won't be guilty. 
05Dt 23:23 Be sure you do whatever you promise, because you have given your word voluntarily to the Lord your God.
05Dt 23:24 "When you enter your countrymen's vineyard, you may eat the grapes to your satisfaction, but don't take any in a basket. 
05Dt 23:25 When you enter your countrymen's grain fields, you may pluck the grain with your hand, but don't put a sickle to his standing grain."
05Dt 24:1 "If a man chooses to enter into marriage with a woman, but she finds herself displeasing to him because he has found something objectionable about her, he must draw up divorce papers, hand them to her, and then send her out of his house. 
05Dt 24:2 If she goes out from his house, becomes the wife of another man, 
05Dt 24:3 and this second husband dislikes her, he, also, must draw up divorce papers, hand them to her, and then send her away from his house. Should the second husband die, 
05Dt 24:4 her first husband who married her and divorced her earlier must not remarry her, because she was defiled, since this is detestable to the Lord. Don't defile the land that the Lord your God is about to give you as a possession.2
05Dt 24:5 "When a man is newly married, he must not be sent out to war or have a related duty placed on him. Let him stay home for one year and be happy with his wife whom he has married.

05Dt 24:11 Stay outside and let the man to whom you made the loan bring it out to you. 
05Dt 24:12 If he is a poor man, don't go to sleep with his collateral in your possession. 
05Dt 24:13 Be sure to return his garment to him at sunset so that he may sleep with it, and he will bless you. It will be a righteous deed in the presence of the Lord your God.
05Dt 24:14 "Don't take advantage of a hired person who is poor and needy, whether he's your fellow citizen or a foreigner who lives in your city. 
05Dt 24:15 Pay his wages that same day before the sun sets, because he is poor and his livelihood depends on it. Otherwise, he may cry out to the Lord against you, and you will incur guilt."
05Dt 24:16 "Fathers must not be put to death on account of their children's sin; nor shall children die on account of their fathers' sin. Each person shall be put to death for his own sin.24
05Dt 24:17 "Don't deny justice to a foreigner or to an orphan, nor take a widow's garment as collateral for a loan. 
05Dt 24:18 Remember to observe this because you were slaves in Egypt, and the Lord your God redeemed you from there. That is why I am commanding you to do this.
05Dt 24:19 "When you are reaping in the field, and you overlook a sheaf, don't return to get it. Let it remain for the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow, in order that the Lord your God may bless everything you undertake.

05Dt 25:2 If the guilty person deserves a beating, the judge will make him lie down and be beaten in his presence with the number of lashes fit for his crime. 
05Dt 25:3 But he must not be beaten more than 40 lashes, because if he receives more than 40 lashes, your brother will be humiliated in your eyes.
05Dt 25:4 "Don't muzzle an ox while it is threshing grain."
05Dt 25:5 "When two brothers are living together and one of them dies without leaving a son, his widow must not be married outside the family to a foreigner. Instead, the brother-in-law must go to her, take her as his wife, and by doing so perform the duty of a brother-in-law. 
05Dt 25:6 The firstborn whom she will bear will continue the name of the dead brother, so his name will not be erased from Israel. 
05Dt 25:7 But if the man does not want to marry his brother's widow, then she must go to the elders at the city gate and declare, 'My husband's brother refuses to perform the duty of a brother-in-law in order to preserve the name of his brother in Israel. He is not willing to perform the duty of a brother-in-law.' 
05Dt 25:8 Then the elders of the city are to summon him and speak with him. If he insists on saying, 'I don't want to marry her,' 
05Dt 25:9 then she is to approach her brother-in-law in the presence of the elders, remove his sandal, spit in his face, and say in response, 'May this be done to the man who does not preserve the lineage of his brother.' 
05Dt 25:10 Then his family name in Israel will be known 'as the family of the one whose sandal was removed.'"
05Dt 25:11 "If two men are fighting together, and the wife of one comes to rescue her husband from the grasp of his assailant, and she reaches out and seizes his genitals, 
05Dt 25:12 cut off her hand. Don't show any pity."
05Dt 25:13 "Don't have different weights in your bag - one heavy and one light. 
05Dt 25:14 Don't have different measuring devices in your house - one large and one small. 
05Dt 25:15 You must have honest weights and measuring devices, so you may live long in the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, 
05Dt 25:16 for anyone who does these things - anyone who deals dishonestly - is detestable to the Lord your God."25
05Dt 25:17 "Remember what the Amalekites did to you along the road while you were coming out of Egypt, 
05Dt 25:18 how when you were very tired and weary, they lay in wait for you on the road and eliminated everyone who was lagging behind. They had no fear of God. 
05Dt 25:19 Therefore, when the Lord your God has given you rest from all your enemies who surround you in the land that he is about to give you to possess as an inheritance, you must completely erase the memory of the Amalekites from under heaven. Don't forget!"
05Dt 26:1 "When you arrive in the land that the Lord your God is about to give you as an inheritance, take possession of it and settle in it. 
05Dt 26:2 Gather all the first produce of the ground that you harvest from your land that the Lord your God is about to give you, place it in a basket, and bring it to the place where the Lord your God will choose to establish his name. 
05Dt 26:3 Approach the priest who is in charge at that time and say to him, 'I acknowledge today to the Lord your God that I've arrived in the land that the Lord promised our ancestors to give us.'
05Dt 26:4 "Then the priest will take the basket from you and place it in front of the altar of the Lord your God. 
05Dt 26:5 Then you are to affirm and declare in the presence of the Lord your God£º A wandering Aramean was my ancestor, who went down to Egypt and traveled there with very few family members, yet there he became a great, powerful, and populous nation. 
05Dt 26:6 But the Egyptians oppressed us, afflicted us, and assigned us to hard labor. 
05Dt 26:7 So we cried out to the Lord God of our ancestors, and he heard our cries and observed our affliction, trouble, and oppression. 
05Dt 26:8 The Lord brought us out of Egypt with his awesome power, with great terror, signs, and wonders. 
05Dt 26:9 And then we arrived at this place, and he gave this land to us, flowing with milk and honey. 
05Dt 26:10 Now, look - I brought the first produce of the land that you, Lord, have given me. Then set it in the presence of the Lord your God and worship him. 
05Dt 26:11 Rejoice with the Levites and the foreigner among you at all the good things that the Lord your God has given you and your family."
05Dt 26:12 "When you have finished your harvest, reserve the tithe in the third year (the year of the tithe), and give the entire tithe to the Levites, to the foreigners, to the orphans, and to the widows, so they may eat and be satisfied in your cities. 
05Dt 26:13 Then declare in the presence of the Lord your God£º 'I've removed the holy offering from my house and given it to the Levites, to the foreigners, to the orphans, and to the widows just as you have commanded me. I haven't violated or forgotten your commands. 
05Dt 26:14 I haven't eaten any part of it while mourning, nor removed any part of it while unclean, nor offered any of it to the dead. I've obeyed the voice of the Lord my God and did all that he commanded me. 
05Dt 26:15 Look down from your holy habitation in heaven and bless your people Israel and the land that you have given us, just as you promised our ancestors - a land flowing with milk and honey.'"
05Dt 26:16 "The Lord your God is commanding you this very day to observe these statutes and judgments. Be careful to obey them with all your heart and soul. 
05Dt 26:17 You have declared this very day that the Lord will be your God. You are to walk in his ways, keep his statutes, commands, and judgments, and obey his voice. 
05Dt 26:18 The Lord affirmed this day that you are his prized possession. Therefore observe his commands, 
05Dt 26:19 so he may elevate you far above all the nations that he has made. Then you will live to the praise, fame, and glory of God, and so be a nation that is holy to the Lord your God, as he has promised."2616
05Dt 27:1 Moses and the elders of Israel gave these orders to the people£º "Observe all of the commandments that I'm giving you today. 
05Dt 27:2 On the day you cross over the Jordan River to the land that the Lord your God is about to give you, set up large stones and coat them with plaster. 
05Dt 27:3 Then inscribe on them all the words of this law when you've crossed over into the land that the Lord your God is about to give you - a land flowing with milk and honey--just as the Lord God of your ancestors promised you.
05Dt 27:4 "When you have crossed the Jordan River, set up these stones about which I'm commanding you today on Mount Ebal, and coat them with plaster. 
05Dt 27:5 Then build an altar there to the Lord your God, an altar of stones that hasn't been worked with iron tools. 
05Dt 27:6 Build the altar to the Lord your God with uncut stones, then offer a burnt offering to him. 
05Dt 27:7 Offer a burnt offering there, then eat and rejoice in the presence of the Lord your God. 
05Dt 27:8 Inscribe on the stones plainly and distinctly all the words of this Law."5
05Dt 27:9 Then Moses and the Levitical priests spoke to Israel. They said, "Be quiet and listen, Israel! Today you have become the people of the Lord your God. 
05Dt 27:10 Listen to his voice and carry out his commands and statutes that I'm giving you today."
05Dt 27:11 Moses commanded the people that day saying, 
05Dt 27:12 "When you cross the Jordan River, these tribes will stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people - Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. 
05Dt 27:13 The tribes of Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulon, Dan, and Naphtali will stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce the curse. 
05Dt 27:14 "The Levites will declare in a loud voice to every Israelite:
05Dt 27:15 'Cursed is the one who makes a sculptured or cast image - a detestable thing to the Lord, the work of a craftsman - and sets it up secretly.' "Then all the people will respond by saying, 'Amen!'
05Dt 27:16 'Cursed is the one who treats his father and mother with dishonor.' "Then all the people will respond by saying, 'Amen!'
05Dt 27:17 'Cursed is the one who moves his neighbor's boundary stone.' "Then all the people are to respond by saying, 'Amen!'

05Dt 27:19 'Cursed is the one who perverts justice due the foreigner, the orphan, or the widow.' "Then all the people are to respond by saying, 'Amen!'
05Dt 27:20 'Cursed is the one who has sexual relations with his father's wife, because he has disgraced his father. "Then all the people are to respond by saying, 'Amen!'
05Dt 27:21 'Cursed is the one who has sexual relations with any animal. "Then all the people are to respond by saying, 'Amen!'
05Dt 27:22 'Cursed is the one who has sexual relations with his sister, the daughter of his father or mother. "Then all the people are to respond by saying, 'Amen!'
05Dt 27:23 'Cursed is the one who has sexual relations with his mother-in-law. "Then all the people are to respond by saying, 'Amen!'
05Dt 27:24 'Cursed is one who strikes his neighbor secretly. "Then all the people are to respond by saying, 'Amen!'27
05Dt 27:25 "Cursed is one who accepts a bribe to kill an innocent person. "Then all the people are to respond by saying, 'Amen!'
05Dt 27:26 "Cursed is the one who doesn't uphold the words of this Law and observe them. "Then all the people are to respond by saying, 'Amen!'"
05Dt 28:1 "Indeed, if you diligently obey the Lord your God to carry out all his commands that I'm giving you today, then the Lord your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth. 
05Dt 28:2 Moreover, all these blessings will come upon you in abundance, if you obey the Lord your God:
05Dt 28:3 "Blessed shall you be in the city and blessed shall you be in the country.
05Dt 28:4 "Blessed shall your children be, as well as the produce of your land, the offspring of your beasts and cattle, and the offspring of your flock.

05Dt 28:6 "Blessed shall you be in your comings and goings."
05Dt 28:7 "The Lord will make your enemies, who rise against you and attack from one direction, to flee from you in seven directions.
05Dt 28:8 "The Lord will send blessings for you with regard to your barns and everything you undertake. Indeed, he will bless you in the land that the Lord your God is about to give you.
05Dt 28:9 "The Lord will assign you to be a holy people for himself, just as he promised you, as long as you keep his commands and walk in his ways.
05Dt 28:10 "Then all the people of the earth will observe that the name of the Lordisproclaimed among you, and they will fear you.
05Dt 28:11 "The Lord will show his abundant goodness with respect to your children, the offspring of your animals, and the produce of your farmland that he promised your ancestors he would give you.
05Dt 28:12 "The Lord will open his rich treasury, the heavens, to release rain upon your land in season and bless everything you undertake so that you'll lend to many nations but won't borrow.
05Dt 28:13 "The Lord your God will make you the head and not the tail - placing you above and not beneath - if you obey the commands of the Lord your God that I'm giving you today to keep and observe. 
05Dt 28:14 Do not deviate from any of his commands that I'm giving you today - neither to the right nor the left - to follow and serve other gods."
05Dt 28:15 "But if you don't obey the Lord your God and faithfully carry out all his commands and statutes that I'm giving you today, then all these curses will come upon you and overwhelm you.
05Dt 28:16 "Cursed shall you be in the city and cursed shall you be in the country.
05Dt 28:17 "Cursed shall be your grain basket and your kneading bowl.
05Dt 28:18 "Cursed shall your children be, as well as the produce of your land, the offspring of your beasts and cattle, and the offspring of your flock.
05Dt 28:19 "Cursed shall you be in your comings and goings." 
05Dt 28:20 "The Lord will send the curse among you, will confuse you, and will rebuke you in everything you undertake until you are destroyed and perish quickly because of your evil deeds, since you will have forsaken him. 
05Dt 28:21 The Lord will cause you to be ill with long-lasting diseases until you are wiped out from the land that you are entering to possess. 
05Dt 28:22 The Lord will afflict you with tuberculosis, fever, inflammation, high fever, drought, blight, and mildew. These will attack you until you are completely destroyed. 
05Dt 28:23 The sky above your head will become bronze while the ground beneath you will become iron. 
05Dt 28:24 The Lord will change the rain on your land to powder and dust. It will come down from the sky until you are exterminated."22
05Dt 28:25 "The Lord will cause you to be defeated by your enemies. You'll go out against them in one direction, but you'll flee from them in seven directions. Consequently, you'll be in a state of great terror throughout all the kingdoms of the earth. 
05Dt 28:26 Your dead bodies will be food for the birds of the sky and the wild animals of the earth, with no one to chase them away.25
05Dt 28:27 "The Lord will afflict you with the boils of Egypt, with tumors, skin disease, and festering rashes, and none of them will be curable. 
05Dt 28:28 The Lord will afflict you with insanity, blindness, and mental confusion. 
05Dt 28:29 As a result, you'll wander aimlessly in broad daylight just as a blind person wanders in darkness. You won't prosper in life. Instead you'll be oppressed and plundered all day long, with no deliverer.
05Dt 28:30 You'll be engaged to a woman, but another man will rape her. You'll build a house but you won't live in it. You'll plant a vineyard but you won't harvest it. 
05Dt 28:31 Your ox will be slaughtered in front of you, and you won't be able to eat it. Your donkey will be stolen from you while you watch and won't be returned to you. Your flock of sheep will be handed to your enemies and there will be no deliverer. 
05Dt 28:32 Your sons and daughters will be given to another people while you watch, and you won't be able to approach them at all, and you'll be powerless to help.
05Dt 28:33 A people whom you don't know will devour what your land and labor produces. You'll be only oppressed and discouraged continually 
05Dt 28:34 until you are driven insane from what your eyes will see.
05Dt 28:35 "The Lord will inflict you with incurable boils on your knees and legs, and from the sole of your foot to the top of your head.
05Dt 28:36 "The Lord will banish you and your king whom you will appoint over you to go to a nation that neither you nor your ancestors have known, and there you'll serve other gods of wood and stone. 
05Dt 28:37 You'll become a desolation and a proverb, and you'll be mocked among the people where the Lord will drive you."
05Dt 28:38 "You'll plant many seeds in a field, but your harvest will be small because the locust will consume it. 
05Dt 28:39 You'll plant a vineyard, but you won't drink wine or harvest any grapes, because worms will consume it. 
05Dt 28:40 You'll have olive trees throughout your territory, but you won't be able to anoint yourself with oil, because the olives will drop off the trees. 
05Dt 28:41 You'll bear sons and daughters, but they won't belong to you, because they'll go into captivity. 
05Dt 28:42 Whirling locusts will consume every tree and the produce of your land. 
05Dt 28:43 The foreigner in your midst will be elevated higher and higher over you, while you are brought low little by little. 
05Dt 28:44 He will lend to you, but you won't lend to him. He'll be the head, but you'll be the tail. 
05Dt 28:45 All these curses will come upon you and will overwhelm you until you are exterminated, because you didn't obey the Lord your God to keep his commands and statutes, which he had commanded you. 
05Dt 28:46 These curses will serve as a sign and wonder for you and your descendants as long as you live."45
05Dt 28:47 "Because you didn't serve the Lord your God joyfully and wholeheartedly, despite the abundance of everything you have, 
05Dt 28:48 you'll serve your enemies whom the Lord your God will send against you. You will serve in famine and in drought, in nakedness, and in lack of everything. They'll set a yoke of iron upon your neck until they have exterminated you.
05Dt 28:49 "The Lord will raise a distant nation against you from the other side of the earth. Swooping down like a vulture, 
05Dt 28:50 it will be a nation whose language you don't understand, whose stern appearance neither shows regard nor extends grace to anyone whether old or young. 
05Dt 28:51 Its army will consume the offspring of your animals and the produce of your soil until you are exterminated. They will leave you without your grain, wine, oil, the increase of your cattle, and the lamb of your flock, until you are completely destroyed. 
05Dt 28:52 They'll besiege all your cities until your high and fortified walls in which you have trusted collapse throughout the land. Indeed, they will besiege all your cities, which the Lord your God gave you.50
05Dt 28:53 "You'll eat your own children - the flesh of your sons and daughters, whom the Lord your God gave you - on account of the siege and the distress with which your enemy will oppress you. 
05Dt 28:54 Even the compassionate man among you - the very sensitive one - will look with evil in his eyes toward his brother, his beloved wife, and his surviving sons, whom he spared. 
05Dt 28:55 He will withhold from each of them the flesh of his sons that he is eating - since there will be nothing left - on account of the siege and distress with which your enemy will oppress you in all your cities. 
05Dt 28:56 The most tender and sensitive lady among you, who doesn't venture to touch the soles of her feet to the ground on account of her daintiness, will look with hostility in her eyes against her beloved husband, her sons, and her daughters. 
05Dt 28:57 She will eat her afterbirth and her newborn children secretly - since there will be nothing left - on account of the siege and distress with which your enemy will oppress you in your cities."28
05Dt 28:58 "If you aren't careful to observe all the words of this Law that have been written in this book, instructing you to fear this glorious and awesome name of the Lord your God 
05Dt 28:59 then he will inflict extraordinary plagues on you and your children, great and lasting plagues, and severe and lasting illnesses. 
05Dt 28:60 He will inflict on you all the diseases of Egypt that you dreaded, and they won't be curable. 
05Dt 28:61 Moreover, the Lord will inflict you with illnesses and plagues that were not written in this book of the Law, until you are exterminated. 
05Dt 28:62 Because you will not have obeyed the Lord your God, very few of you will be left - instead of you being as numerous as the stars in the heavens. 
05Dt 28:63 Just as the Lord delighted to prosper and increase you, so now the Lord will delight to destroy, exterminate, and banish you from the land that you are about to enter to possess."
05Dt 28:64 "He'll scatter you among the peoples from one end of the earth to the other, and there you'll serve other gods made of wood and stones, which neither you nor your ancestors have known. 
05Dt 28:65 Among those nations you'll have no rest. There'll be no resting place for the soles of your feet. Instead, the Lord will give you an anxious heart, failing eyesight, and a despairing spirit. 
05Dt 28:66 You'll cling to life, being fearful by both night and day, with no assurance of survival. 
05Dt 28:67 In the morning you'll say, 'I wish it were evening.' Yet in the evening you'll say, "I wish it were morning," on account of what you'll dread and what you'll see. 
05Dt 28:68 Finally, the Lord will bring you back to Egypt by ship, a place that I said you'll never see again. There you'll try to sell yourselves to your enemies as male and female slaves, but no one will buy you."
05Dt 29:1 Th05Dt 28:ese are the terms of the covenant, which the Lord commanded Moses to make with the Israelites in the land of Moab in addition to the covenant that he made with them in Horeb. 
05Dt 29:2 Moses called all Israel together and addressed them£º "You saw everything that the Lord did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his servants, and to his whole country. 
05Dt 29:3 Those great feats that you saw with your own eyes are signs and great wonders. 
05Dt 29:4 Yet to this day, the Lord hasn't given you a heart that understands, eyes that perceive, and ears that discern.2
05Dt 29:5 "Though I've led you for 40 years in the desert, neither your clothes nor your shoes have worn out. 
05Dt 29:6 You didn't have to eat bread or drink wine or an intoxicating drink, in order to know that I am the Lord your God. 
05Dt 29:7 Then you reached this place, where King Sihon of Heshbon and King Og of Bashan had come out to meet and fight with us, but we defeated them. 
05Dt 29:8 We captured their land and handed it as an inheritance to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and half the tribe of Manasseh. 
05Dt 29:9 Therefore, keep the terms of this covenant, carrying them out so that you'll be wise in everything you do."
05Dt 29:10 "All of you are standing today in the presence of the Lord your God - the heads of your tribes, your elders, your magistrates, all the men of Israel, 
05Dt 29:11 along with your children, your wives, even the foreigner in your camp, including the woodchopper and the water drawer - 
05Dt 29:12 to enter into a covenant with the Lord your God and into the oath that he is about to make with you today, 
05Dt 29:13 so that he will elevate you to be a people for him. And he will be God to you, just as he promised you and swore to your ancestors Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 
05Dt 29:14 Now, I'm not making this covenant and oath with you alone, 
05Dt 29:15 but with whoever is here with us standing in the presence of the Lord our God today, as well as with those who aren't here with us today."
05Dt 29:16 "Now, you know how we lived in the land of Egypt and how we traveled through the territory of other nations. 
05Dt 29:17 You have seen their detestable practices, their idols of wood, stone, silver, and gold that they had with them. 
05Dt 29:18 Be alert so there is no man, woman, family, or a tribe whose heart is turning away from the Lord your God to go and serve the gods of those nations. "Be alert so there will be no root among you that produces poisonous and bitter fruit, 
05Dt 29:19 because when such a person hears the words of this oath, he will bless himself and say£º 'I will have a peaceful life, even though I'm determined to be stubborn.' By doing this he will be sweeping away both watered and parched ground alike.'
05Dt 29:20 The Lord won't forgive such a person. Instead, the zealous anger of the Lord will blaze against him. All the curses that were written in this book will fall on him. Then the Lord will wipe out his memory from under heaven. 
05Dt 29:21 The Lord will set him apart from all the tribes of Israel for destruction, according to the curses of the covenant that were written in this book of the Law."
05Dt 29:22 "Then the generation to come - your descendants after you and the foreigners who come from afar - will see plagues and illnesses infecting the land that the Lord will inflict on it. 
05Dt 29:23 The whole land will be covered with salt pits and burning sulfur, with nothing planted, nothing sprouting, and producing no vegetation - overthrown like Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, and Zeboiim, when the Lord had overthrown them in his raging fury. 
05Dt 29:24 All the nations will ask, 'Why did the Lord do this to this land?What is the meaning of this fierce and great anger?' 
05Dt 29:25 Then they will answer themselves, 'Because they've abandoned the covenant of their Lord, the God of their ancestors that he had made with them when he brought them out of Egypt. 
05Dt 29:26 They followed and worshipped other gods whom they had not known and whom he did not assign to them. 
05Dt 29:27 For this reason, the anger of the Lord raged against this land, to bring upon it all the curses that were written in this book. 
05Dt 29:28 The Lord uprooted them from the land in his anger, wrath, and great fury, deporting them to another land, and that's the way things are today.'29
05Dt 29:29 The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but what has been revealed belongs to us and to our children forever, so that we might observe the words of this Law."29
05Dt 30:1 "When all these things happen to you - both the blessings and the curses that I've presented to you - and you take them seriously in all the nations where the Lord your God will deport you, 
05Dt 30:2 and when you - you and your descendants, that is - will have returned to him and obeyed all the commands that I'm giving you today with all your heart and soul, 
05Dt 30:3 then the Lord your God will restore your fortunes and will show compassion to you. He will gather you from among the peoples where he had scattered you. 
05Dt 30:4 Even if the Lord had banished you to the ends of the heavens, the Lord your God will gather you from there 
05Dt 30:5 and he'll bring you to the land that your ancestors inherited. You'll possess it, you'll prosper, and you'll greatly multiply more than your ancestors did. 
05Dt 30:6 Then the Lord your God will circumcise both your hearts and those of your descendants so that you can love him with your heart and with your soul and therefore live. 
05Dt 30:7 Then the Lord your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate and persecute you."304
05Dt 30:8 "So now, return and obey the Lord your God and observe all his commands that I'm giving you today, 
05Dt 30:9 and the Lord your God will prosper you abundantly in all that you do, along with your children, your livestock, and the produce of your fields. For the Lord your God will again be delighted with you for good, just as he was delighted with your ancestors, 
05Dt 30:10 if you obey him and keep his commands and statutes that are written in this book of the Law, and if you return to him with all your heart and soul.
05Dt 30:11 "Indeed, these commands that I'm giving you today are neither confusing nor unattainable for you. 
05Dt 30:12 They aren't in the heavens, so you have to ask, 'Who'll go up to the heavens for us and get it for us so we can hear it and act on it?' 
05Dt 30:13 And they aren't beyond the seas either, so you have to ask, 'Who'll cross the sea and get it for us so we can hear it and act on it?' 
05Dt 30:14 No, the word is very near you - it's within your mouth and heart for you to attain."
05Dt 30:15 "Look, today I have set before you life and what is good, along with death and what is evil. 
05Dt 30:16 That's why I'm commanding you today to love the Lord your God by walking in his ways and by observing his commands, statutes, and ordinances, so that you may live long, increase, and so that the Lord your God may bless you in the land that you are about to enter to possess.
05Dt 30:17 "But if you turn your heart away, and do not obey, but instead if you stray away to worship and serve other gods, 
05Dt 30:18 I'm declaring to you today that you will surely be destroyed. You won't live long in the land that you are crossing the Jordan River to enter and possess.
05Dt 30:19 "I adjure heaven and earth to testify against you today! I've set life and death before you today£º both blessings and curses. Choose life, that it may be well with you - you and your children. 
05Dt 30:20 Love the Lord your God, obey his voice, and cling to him, because he is your life - even your long life - so that you may live in the land that the Lord promised to give Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
05Dt 31:1 Moses went and explained these things to everyone in Israel. 
05Dt 31:2 Then he concluded, "I'm now 120 years old. I'm not able to get around anymore, 
05Dt 31:3 and the Lord said to me, 'You won't be crossing the Jordan River.' But the Lord your God is crossing over before you. He will destroy these nations in front of you and you will dispossess them. "As for Joshua, he will cross over before you, just as the Lord promised. 
05Dt 31:4 The Lord will do to them just as he did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land when he destroyed them. 
05Dt 31:5 The Lord will hand them over to you, so you can do to them what I've instructed you to do. 
05Dt 31:6 Be strong and courageous. Don't fear or tremble before them, because the Lord your God will be the One who keeps on walking with you - he won't leave you or abandon you."5
05Dt 31:7 Then Moses called on Joshua and said to him in the presence of everyone in Israel, "Be strong and courageous, because you'll bring this people to the land that the Lord your God had promised to give your ancestors. You will be the one who causes them to possess it. 
05Dt 31:8 Indeed, the LORD is the One who will keep on walking in front of you. He'll be with you and won't leave you or abandon you, so never be afraid and never be dismayed."
05Dt 31:9 Then Moses wrote down this Law and gave it to the Levitical priests who carry the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord and to all of Israel's leaders. 
05Dt 31:10 Then he gave these orders£º "At the end of seven years, the year designated for release, during the Feast of Tabernacles, 
05Dt 31:11 when all of Israel comes to appear in the presence of the Lord your God at the place that he'll choose, read this Law aloud to them. 
05Dt 31:12 Gather the people - the men, women, children, and the foreigners that live in your cities - so they may hear and fear the Lord your God, and so they may be careful to obey the words contained in this Law. 
05Dt 31:13 Their children who don't know will hear and learn to fear the Lord your God as long as you live in the land that you are crossing the Jordan River to possess."
05Dt 31:14 Then the Lord said to Moses£º "Look! Because your time to die is approaching, call Joshua, present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting, and then I will commission him." Moses and Joshua complied and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting. 
05Dt 31:15 So the Lord appeared at the tent in a pillar of cloud that stood above the entrance.14
05Dt 31:16 Then the Lord said to Moses£º "Look! You are about to join your ancestors. Afterwards, this people will rebel and commit prostitution with the foreign gods of the land that they are about to enter to possess. They will abandon me and break my covenant that I made with them. 
05Dt 31:17 When that happens, my anger will burn against them, because they will have abandoned me. I'll hide my face from them, they will be consumed, and many evils and distresses will find them. When this happens, they will say, 'These troubles have happened to us because God isn't among us.' 
05Dt 31:18 I'll surely hide my face in that day on account of the evil that they will have done for they turned to other gods."16
05Dt 31:19 "Now write this song and teach it to the Israelites. Put this song in their very mouths, so that it will be a witness for me against the Israelites, 
05Dt 31:20 because after I've brought them to the land flowing with milk and honey that I promised to their ancestors by an oath, they'll eat, grow fat, and then they'll turn to other gods and serve them, while despising me and breaking my covenant. 
05Dt 31:21 Then, when many evils and troubles will have come upon them, this song will serve as a witness against them, since their descendants won't fail to sing it. I know the plan that they are devising even before I bring them into the land that I promised them by an oath."
05Dt 31:22 So Moses wrote the song that very day and taught it to the Israelites. 
05Dt 31:23 Then the Lord charged Nun's son Joshua, "Be strong and courageous, because you'll bring the Israelites to the land that I promised to them by an oath. I'll be with you."
05Dt 31:24 When Moses had finished writing the words of this Law in a book, 
05Dt 31:25 he gave this charge to the Levites who carried the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord£º 
05Dt 31:26 "Take the book of this Law and set it beside the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God. Let it remain there with you as witness against you, 
05Dt 31:27 because indeed I know your rebellion and stubbornness. Note that even while I'm still alive, you've been rebelling against the Lord - how much more so after my death! 
05Dt 31:28 Gather together the leaders of your tribes and your foremen so I can speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and the earth as witnesses against them, 
05Dt 31:29 because I know that after my death, you'll surely act wickedly and turn from the road that I've instructed you. As a result, evil will fall on you in days to come, because you'll act wickedly in the sight of the Lord, causing him to become angry due to your behavior." 
05Dt 31:30 So Moses spoke the words of this song - to the very end - in front of the entire assembly of Israel.3129
05Dt 32:1 Hear, heavens, and I will speak! Listen, earth, to the words of my mouth!
05Dt 32:2 May my instructions descend like rain and may my words flow like dew, as light rain upon the grass, and as showers upon new plants.
05Dt 32:3 For I'll proclaim the name of our Lord. Ascribe greatness to our God!
05Dt 32:4 Flawless is the work of the Rock, because all his ways are just. A faithful God - never unjust - righteous and upright is he.
05Dt 32:5 But those who are not his children acted corruptly against him; they are a defective and perverted generation.
05Dt 32:6 This is not the way to repay the Lord, is it, you foolish and witless people?Is he not your father, who bought you, formed you, and established you - 
05Dt 32:7 Remember the days of old, reflect on the years of previous generations. Ask your father, and he'll tell you; your elders will inform you.
05Dt 32:8 When the Most High gave nations as their inheritance, when he separated the human race, he set boundaries for the people according to the number of the children of God.
05Dt 32:9 For the Lord's portion is his people; Jacob is his allotted portion.
05Dt 32:10 The Lord found him in a desert land, in a barren, eerie wilderness. He surrounded, cared for, and guarded him as the pupil of his eye.
05Dt 32:11 Like an eagle stirs its nest, hovering near its young, spreading out his wings to take him and carry him on his pinions,
05Dt 32:12 the Lord alone guided him. There was no foreign god with him.
05Dt 32:13 He mounted him on a high place above the earth, feeding him from the produce of the field. He nourished him with honey from the rock and with oil from the flint rock,
05Dt 32:14 with curds from cattle and with milk from sheep, with the fat of lambs, with rams from Bashan, with the fat of goats, with the finest of wheat - and from the juice of grapes you drank wine.
05Dt 32:15 Jacob dined until satisfied; Jeshurun grew fat and kicked. He grew fat, coarse, and gross, so that he abandoned the God who made him and spurned the Rock that was his salvation.
05Dt 32:16 They provoked him to jealousy over foreigners and to anger over detestable things.
05Dt 32:17 They sacrificed to demons - not to the real God - gods whom they didn't know, new neighbors who had recently appeared, whom your ancestors never feared.
05Dt 32:18 You neglected the Rock that fathered you; you abandoned God, who was awaiting your birth.
05Dt 32:19 The Lord saw it and became jealous, provoked by his sons and daughters.
05Dt 32:20 So he said£º "Let me hide my face from them. I will observe what their end will be, because they are a perverted generation, children within whom there is no loyalty.
05Dt 32:21 They provoked me to jealousy over non-gods, and to be angry over their vanity. Now I'll provoke them to jealousy over a non-people; and over a foolish nation I shall provoke them to anger.
05Dt 32:22 For a fire breaks out in my anger - burning to the deepest part of Sheol, consuming the earth and its produce and igniting the foundations of the mountains.
05Dt 32:23 I'll bury them in misfortunes and bring them to an end with my arrows.
05Dt 32:24 Emaciated from famine, feverish from plague, and destroyed by bitterness, I'll send fanged beasts against them, along with poisonous snakes that glide through the dust.
05Dt 32:25 Outside, the sword will cause bereavement; within, there shall be terror for the young man and virgin alike, also for the nursing infant and the aged man."
05Dt 32:26 I said£º "I will scatter them, erasing their memory from the human race, 
05Dt 32:27 if it weren't for dreading the taunting of their enemies - otherwise, their adversary might misinterpret and say, 'Our power is great. It isn't the Lord who made all of this happen.'"
05Dt 32:28 They are a nation devoid of purpose and without insight.
05Dt 32:29 O, that they were wise to understand this and consider their future!
05Dt 32:30 How can one person chase a thousand of them and two put a myriad to flight, unless their Rock delivers them and the Lord gives them up - 
05Dt 32:31 For their rock isn't like our Rock, as even our enemies admit.
05Dt 32:32 Instead, their vine is from the vines of Sodom and the vineyards of Gomorrah. Their grapes are poisonous; their clusters bitter.
05Dt 32:33 Their wine is the venom of serpents, a poisonous cobra.
05Dt 32:34 "Is this not kept in reserve, sealed up with me in my treasury - 
05Dt 32:35 To me belong vengeance and recompense. In due time their feet will slip, because their time of calamity is near and the things prepared for them draw near.
05Dt 32:36 For the Lord will vindicate his people and bring comfort to his servants, because he will observe that their power has waned, when neither prisoner nor free person remain.
05Dt 32:37 "He will say, 'Where are their gods, the rock in which they took refuge - 
05Dt 32:38 Who ate the fat of their offerings and drank the wine that was their drink offering?Let them rise and help you and be your hiding place!'
05Dt 32:39 "Look now! I AM, and there is no other god besides me. I myself cause death and I sustain life; I wound severely and I also heal; from my power no one can deliver.
05Dt 32:40 "I solemnly swear to heaven - I say 'As certainly as I'm alive and living forever,
05Dt 32:41 I'll whet my shining sword, with my hands in firm grasp of judgment. I'll show vengeance on my adversary and repay those who keep on hating me.
05Dt 32:42 I'll make my arrows drunk with blood. My sword will devour flesh, along with the blood of the slain, and I'll take their enemy leaders captive.'
05Dt 32:43 "Sing for joy, nations! Sing for joy, people who belong to him! For he'll avenge the blood of his servants, turn on his adversary, and cleanse both his land and his people."
05Dt 32:44 So Moses and Nun's son Joshua came and recited all the words of this song while the people were assembled. 
05Dt 32:45 When Moses had finished addressing all of these words to all Israel, 
05Dt 32:46 he said to them, "Take to heart my entire testimony against you today. Command your children to observe carefully every word of this Law, 
05Dt 32:47 because they're not just empty words for you - they are your very life. Through these instructions you will live long in the land that you are about to cross over the Jordan River to possess.
05Dt 32:48 Later that day, the Lord said to Moses, 
05Dt 32:49 "Ascend this Abarim mountain range toward Mount Nebo in the land of Moab across from Jericho, and look out over the land of Canaan that I'm about to give to the Israelites as a possession. 
05Dt 32:50 You will die on the mountain that you are about to ascend and be taken to be with your ancestors, just as your brother Aaron died on Mount Hor and was taken to be with his ancestors. 
05Dt 32:51 Both of you acted unfaithfully against me among the Israelites at Meribah-Kadesh in the desert of Sin, when you failed to uphold my holiness among the Israelites. 
05Dt 32:52 You'll see the land from a distance, but you won't be able to enter the land that I am about to give to the Israelites."
05Dt 33:1 This is the blessing with which Moses, the man of God, blessed the Israelites before his death. 
05Dt 33:2 He said£º "The Lord came from Sinai. Rising from Seir upon us, he shone forth from Mount Paran, accompanied by a myriad of his holy ones, with flaming fire from his right hand for them.
05Dt 33:3 Indeed, lover of people, all of his holy ones are in your control. They gather at your feet to do as you have instructed.
05Dt 33:4 Moses commanded with the Law, an inheritance for the community of Jacob.
05Dt 33:5 The Lord was king of Jeshurun when the leaders of the people - all the tribes of Israel - gathered together."
05Dt 33:6 "May Reuben live and not die, though his numbers are few."
05Dt 33:7 He declared this about Judah£º "Hear, Lord, the voice of Judah and return him to his people. With his own strength he fights for himself, and you will be of assistance against his enemies."
05Dt 33:8 About Levi he said£º "Let your Thummim and Urim be with the man to whom you showed gracious love, whom you tested at Maasah and with whom you struggled at the waters of Meribah,
05Dt 33:9 the one who said to his mother and father, 'I don't know them,' and who would neither acknowledge his brothers nor know his own children. For they kept your word and guarded your covenant.
05Dt 33:10 They will teach your ordinances to Jacob, and your Law to Israel. They will offer incense as a pleasant aroma to you and a whole burnt offering upon your altar.
05Dt 33:11 Lord, bless his substance and approve the work that he undertakes. Shatter the legs of those who oppose against him; may those who hate him stand no more."
05Dt 33:12 About Benjamin he said£º "The beloved of the Lord will live confidently, the Most High protecting him all day long, and resting in his bosom."
05Dt 33:13 About Joseph he said£º "May the blessing of the Lord be on his land£º dew from the choicest of the heavens, and from the depths beneath;
05Dt 33:14 from the choicest products of the sun, the rich fruit of the harvest moon,
05Dt 33:15 the choicest portion of the eternal mountains, and the best of the everlasting hills;
05Dt 33:16 from the choicest of the earth and its fullness, and the favor of the One who lived in the burning bush. May blessing rest on Joseph's head, and on the crown of the head of the one set apart from his brothers.
05Dt 33:17 May the firstborn of his bull be honorable to him, and his horns be the horn of a wild ox. With them may he push people all together, to the ends of the earth. These are the myriads of Ephraim and the thousands of Manasseh."
05Dt 33:18 About Zebulun he said£º "Zebulun, rejoice as you go out and Issachar, in being inside your tents.
05Dt 33:19 They will call the peoples to the mountain, and there they will offer righteous sacrifices, for they'll draw from the abundance of the sea and from the hidden treasures of the sand."
05Dt 33:20 About Gad he said£º "Blessed be the One who enlarges Gad! Like a roaring lion, he crouches, tearing arm and scalp.
05Dt 33:21 He chose the best part for himself, when the leader's portion was assigned. He came at the head of the people, carrying out the Lord's justice and his ordinances concerning Israel."
05Dt 33:22 About Dan he said£º "Dan is a lion's cub, leaping forth from Bashan."
05Dt 33:23 About Naphtali he said£º "Naphtali, full of favor and the Lord's blessing, take possession of the west and south."
05Dt 33:24 About Asher he said£º "May Asher be blessed, along with his descendants, may his brothers be pleased with him, may he dip his feet in oil,
05Dt 33:25 may your bolts be made of iron and bronze, and may your strength be sufficient for each day you live."
05Dt 33:26 "There is no one like the God of Jeshurun, who rides through the heavens with its lofty clouds to help you.
05Dt 33:27 The God of old is a dwelling place, with everlasting arms underneath. He drove out your enemies before you and said£º 'Destroy them!'
05Dt 33:28 So Israel lives in confidence, isolated as the fountain of Jacob in a land of grain and new wine, where the heavens rain down dew.
05Dt 33:29 How blessed are you, Israel! Who can be like you, a people delivered by the Lord, your shield of help and your finely crafted sword. May your enemies cower before you. You will tread down their high places.
05Dt 34:1 Moses ascended from the desert plain of Moab toward Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, across from Jericho. There the Lord showed him the entire land, from Gilgal as far as Dan, 
05Dt 34:2 all of Naphtali, the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh, and the entire territory of Judah all the way to out over the sea, 
05Dt 34:3 including the Negev, the Arabah, the valley of Jericho, and the city of the palm trees as far as Zoar. 
05Dt 34:4 Then the Lord said to him£º "This is the land that I promised to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by an oath when I said, 'I'll give it to your descendants.' I'll let you see it with your eyes, but you won't cross over there."
05Dt 34:5 So Moses, the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab, just as the Lord had said. 
05Dt 34:6 He was buried in the valley opposite Beth Peor, in the land of Moab, but no one knows to this day where his burial place is. 
05Dt 34:7 Moses was 120 years old when he died. His eyesight wasn't impaired and he was still vigorous and strong. 
05Dt 34:8 The Israelites mourned for Moses at the desert plain of Moab for 30 days, after which the period of mourning for Moses was completed.7
05Dt 34:9 Now Nun's son Joshua was full of the spirit of wisdom, because Moses had placed his hands on him, so Israelites listened to him and did what the Lord had commanded Moses. 
05Dt 34:10 No prophet ever rose again in Israel like Moses, whom the Lord knew with such great intimacy. 
05Dt 34:11 What signs and wonders the Lord sent him to do throughout the land of Egypt, to Pharaoh, and to all of his servants who lived in the whole land! 
05Dt 34:12 What great power and great terror Moses displayed on behalf of all Israel!
06
06Jos 1:1 After Moses, the servant of the Lord, had died, the Lord spoke to Nun's son Joshua, announcing to him, 
06Jos 1:2 "My servant Moses is dead. Now get ready to cross the Jordan River - you and all the people - to the land that I'm giving the Israelites. 
06Jos 1:3 I'm giving you every place where the sole of your foot falls, just as I promised Moses. 
06Jos 1:4 Your territorial border will extend from the wilderness to the Lebanon Mountains, from the great River Euphrates - all the land of the Hittites - as far as the Mediterranean Sea where the sun sets. 
06Jos 1:5 No one will be victorious against you for the rest of your life. I'll be with you just like I was with Moses - I'll neither fail you nor abandon you.
06Jos 1:6 "Be strong and courageous, because you'll be leading this people to inherit the land that I promised to give their ancestors. 
06Jos 1:7 Only be strong and very courageous to ensure that you obey all the instructions that my servant Moses gave you - turn neither to the right nor to the left from it - so that you may succeed wherever you go. 
06Jos 1:8 This set of instructions is not to cease being a part of your conversations. Meditate on it day and night, so that you may be careful to carry out everything that's written in it, for then you'll prosper and succeed. 
06Jos 1:9 "I've commanded you, haven't I?Be strong and courageous. Don't be fearful or discouraged, because the Lord your God is with you wherever you go."
06Jos 1:10 Then Joshua gave orders to the officials of the people. 
06Jos 1:11 "Go through the camp," he said, "and command the people, 'Prepare provisions for yourselves, because within three days you'll be crossing the Jordan River to take possession of the land that the Lord your God is giving you - so go get it!'"
06Jos 1:12 Joshua told the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 
06Jos 1:13 "Remember what Moses commanded you when he said, 'The Lord your God will provide you rest, as well as this land.' 
06Jos 1:14 Your wives, your young children, and your livestock will remain in the land that Moses gave you on this side of the Jordan River, but you and all your warriors will cross, ready for battle, in full view of your relatives, and you will help them 
06Jos 1:15 until the Lord gives relief to your relatives, as he did to you. Then they'll take the land that the Lord your God is giving them as their inheritance. You'll return to the land of your heritage and receive the inheritance that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you on the east side of the Jordan River, in the direction of the sunrise."1
06Jos 1:16 "We'll do everything that you commanded," they replied. "We'll go wherever you send us. 
06Jos 1:17 We'll listen and obey you in everything, just like we did with Moses. Only may the Lord your God be with you, just as he was with Moses. 
06Jos 1:18 Anyone who rebels against what you say and doesn't listen to your words regarding everything that you command will be executed. Only be strong and courageous."
06Jos 2:1 After this, Nun's son Joshua sent two men from the Acacia groves as undercover scouts. He told them, "Go and look over the land. Pay special attention to Jericho." So they went out, came to the house of a prostitute named Rahab, and lodged there.
06Jos 2:2 Then the king of Jericho was told, "Look! Israelite men arrived tonight to scout out the land."
06Jos 2:3 So the king of Jericho sent for Rahab and ordered her, "Bring out the men who came to visit you and lodged in your house, because they've come to scout out the entire land."
06Jos 2:4 Now the woman had taken the two men and hid them. So she replied, "The men really did come to me, but I didn't know from where they came. 
06Jos 2:5 At dusk, when it was time to close the city gates, the men left. I don't know where the men went. Go after them quickly, and you might overtake them."
06Jos 2:6 But she had taken them up to the roof and had hidden them among stalks of flax that she had laid out in order on the roof. 
06Jos 2:7 So the men pursued them along the road that leads to the fords of the Jordan River. As soon as the search party had left, they shut the city gate after them.
06Jos 2:8 Before the scouts had lain down, she went up to them on the roof 
06Jos 2:9 "I'm really convinced that the Lord has given you the land," she said, "because we're overwhelmed with fear of you. All the other inhabitants of the land are demoralized at your presence, 
06Jos 2:10 because we heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Reed Sea right in front of you as you were coming out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were on the other side of the Jordan River - to Sihon and Og - whom you completely destroyed. 
06Jos 2:11 When we heard these reports, we all became terrified and discouraged because of you, for the Lord your God is God in heaven above and on the earth beneath. 
06Jos 2:12 Now therefore, since I've treated you so kindly, please swear in the name of the Lord that you'll also be kind to my father's household by giving me this sure sign£º 
06Jos 2:13 Spare my father, my mother, and my brothers and sisters, along with everyone who belongs with them so we won't be killed."
06Jos 2:14 So the men said to her, "Our life for yours - even to death - if you don't betray this mission of ours. Then when the Lord gives us this land, we'll treat you graciously and faithfully."
06Jos 2:15 So she let them down by a rope through the window, since her house was built into the town wall where she lived. 
06Jos 2:16 She said to them, "Go out to the hill country, so the search party won't find you, and hide for three days. After that, you may go on your own way."
06Jos 2:17 The men replied, "We'll be free from our commitment to you to which you've obligated us 
06Jos 2:18 when we invade the land, if you don't tie this rope made with red cords in the window through which you let us down, and if you don't gather your father, your mother, your brothers, and all of the rest of your father's household into your house. 
06Jos 2:19 Everyone who leaves through the doors of your house into the street will be responsible for his own death, but we'll be responsible for anyone who remains with you in the house if even so much as a hand is laid on him. 
06Jos 2:20 But if you report this incident, we'll be free from the oath to which you've made us swear."218
06Jos 2:21 "Since you put it that way," she replied, "I agree." After she sent them on their way and they had left, she tied the red cord in the window.
06Jos 2:22 The scouts left for the hill country and remained there for three days until the search party returned. The search party searched the entire road, but was unable to find them. 
06Jos 2:23 Later, the two men returned from the hill country, crossed over the Jordan River, approached Nun's son Joshua, and told him everything that had happened to them. 
06Jos 2:24 They reported to Joshua, "The Lord really has given the entire land into our control. The inhabitants of the land have melted away right in front of us!"
06Jos 3:1 Joshua got up early the next morning. Accompanied by all the Israelites, he set out from the Acacia groves and arrived at the Jordan River, where they encamped before crossing it. 
06Jos 3:2 T hree days later, the officers went throughout the camp, 
06Jos 3:3 g iving orders to the people. They said, "When you see the ark of the covenant of the Lord your God being carried by the Levitical priests, then get up, leave where you are, and follow it. 
06Jos 3:4 Be sure to keep a distance of about 1,000 yards between you and it. Don't come near it, so you can be certain where you're going, since you haven't passed this way before."
06Jos 3:5 Then Joshua addressed the people£º "Consecrate yourselves, because tomorrow the Lord will do marvelous things among you."
06Jos 3:6 After this, Joshua instructed the priests, "Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over ahead of the people." So they took up the ark of the covenant and went on ahead of the people.
06Jos 3:7 At this point, the Lord said to Joshua, "Today I'm going to exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so they'll be sure that I'm going to be with you just as I was with Moses. 
06Jos 3:8 Give this command to the priests who are carrying the ark of the covenant£º 'When you arrive at the water of the Jordan River, stand still in the Jordan.'"3
06Jos 3:9 So Joshua said to the Israelites, "Come here and listen to what the Lord your God has to say." 
06Jos 3:10 Joshua continued, "This is how you'll know that the living God really is among you£º he's going to remove the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Hivites, the Perizzites, the Girgashites, the Amorites, and the Jebusites right in front of you. 
06Jos 3:11 Look! The ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing ahead of you into the Jordan River. 
06Jos 3:12 So take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe. 
06Jos 3:13 When the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, touch the water in the Jordan River, the water that feeds the Jordan will be cut off from above and they'll stand still in a single location."
06Jos 3:14 So the people set out from their tents to cross the Jordan River, with the priests carrying the ark of the covenant in full view of the people. 
06Jos 3:15 When the priests who carried the ark entered the Jordan River, as their feet touched the water's edge (The Jordan River overflows all of its banks daily during the harvest season.), 
06Jos 3:16 the water flowing downstream from above stood still in a single location, a great distance away at Adam, a city near Zarethan. The water that flowed south toward the sea in the Arabah (that is, the Dead Sea) was completely cut off. So the people crossed opposite Jericho. 
06Jos 3:17 The priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the middle of the Jordan River, while all Israel crossed on dry ground until the entire nation had finished crossing the Jordan River.
06Jos 4:1 As soon as the entire nation had completed its crossing of the Jordan, the Lord spoke to Joshua. He said, 
06Jos 4:2 "Gather together twelve men from the people - one man from each tribe?
06Jos 4:3 and tell them, 'Pick up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan where the priests' feet were standing, bring them along with you, and put them down where you camp tonight.'"2
06Jos 4:4 So Joshua called the twelve men whom he had chosen from the people of Israel, one man from each tribe. 
06Jos 4:5 Joshua told them, "Cross over again in front of the ark of the Lord your God into the middle of the Jordan River. Then each of you pick up a stone on his shoulder with which to build a memorial, one for each of the tribes of Israel. 
06Jos 4:6 Let this serve as a sign among you, so that when your children ask in times to come, 'What do these stones mean to you,' 
06Jos 4:7 then you'll say to them, 'Because the waters of the Jordan River were cut off in front of the ark of the covenant of the Lord. When it crossed the Jordan River, the waters of the Jordan were cut off.' So these stones shall become a memorial to the Israelites forever."
06Jos 4:8 The Israelites did just as Joshua commanded. They took up twelve stones from the middle of the Jordan River - just as the Lord had spoken to Joshua - according to the number of the tribes of the Israelites, and they carried them over to where they would be pitching camp, and they put them down there. 
06Jos 4:9 Then Joshua set up twelve stones in the middle of the Jordan River at the location where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant had been standing, and they remain there to this day.
06Jos 4:10 The priests who were carrying the ark stood in the middle of the Jordan River until everything had been done in accordance with what the Lord had commanded Joshua to speak to the people and with everything that Moses had commanded Joshua. So the people hurried and crossed over. 
06Jos 4:11 When all of the people had completed their crossing, the ark of the Lord and the priests crossed over in full view of the people. 
06Jos 4:12 Just as Moses had directed, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh crossed over, dressed in battle regalia, in full view of the other Israelites. 
06Jos 4:13 About 40,000 soldiers equipped to do battle in the Lord's presence crossed over to the desert plains of Jericho.
06Jos 4:14 That day, the Lord exalted Joshua in the presence of all Israel so that they revered him just as they had revered Moses throughout his life.4
06Jos 4:15 Now the Lord had told Joshua, 
06Jos 4:16 "Command the priests who carry the ark of the testimony to come up from the Jordan River."
06Jos 4:17 So Joshua ordered the priests, "Come up from the Jordan River."
06Jos 4:18 As soon as the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord had come up from the middle of the Jordan River, and the soles of the priests' feet came up to dry ground, the water of the Jordan River returned to normal, covering its banks as it had done so before.
06Jos 4:19 The people came up from the Jordan River on the tenth day of the first month and camped at Gilgal on the eastern outskirts of Jericho. 
06Jos 4:20 Joshua set up the twelve stones that they had removed from the Jordan River at Gilgal. 
06Jos 4:21 Then he said to the Israelites, "When your descendants ask their parents in years to come, 'What is the meaning of these stones?' 
06Jos 4:22 you are to tell your descendants£º 'Israel crossed this Jordan River on dry ground 
06Jos 4:23 because the Lord your God dried up the water of the Jordan River right in front of you, until you had crossed over, just as the Lord your God had done to the Reed Sea - which he had dried up in front of us until we had crossed it also.' 
06Jos 4:24 Do this so that all of the people of the earth may know how strong the power of the Lord is, and so that you may fear the Lord your God every day." 
06Jos 5:1 All the Amorite kings who lived across the Jordan River to the west and all the Canaanites kings by the Mediterranean Sea became discouraged as soon as they heard that the Lord had dried up the water of the Jordan River for the people of Israel until they had crossed it. They no longer had a will to fight because of the people of Israel.
06Jos 5:2 At that time the Lord said to Joshua, "Make for yourselves some flint knives and circumcise the Israelites who haven't been circumcised yet."
06Jos 5:3 So Joshua made some flint knives and circumcised the Israelites at Gibeath-haaraloth. 
06Jos 5:4 Joshua circumcised them because all of the males among the people who came out of Egypt - that is, all the warriors - had died during their journey through the wilderness following their departure from Egypt. 
06Jos 5:5 Although everyone who had left Egypt had been circumcised, nevertheless all the people born during the journey after their departure from Egypt had not been circumcised. 
06Jos 5:6 The Israelites traveled 40 years in the wilderness until the entire nation - that is, the warriors who had departed from Egypt - had perished because they hadn't listened to the voice of the Lord. The Lord had promised them that he would not let them see the land that he had sworn to give us, a land that flows with milk and honey. 
06Jos 5:7 As a result, it was their descendants, whom he raised up to take their place, that Joshua circumcised. They had remained uncircumcised, because they had not been circumcised during their journey. 
06Jos 5:8 When the circumcision of the entire nation was complete, they remained in their places within the camp until they were healed.
06Jos 5:9 Then the Lord told Joshua, "Today I have rolled the disgrace of Egypt away from you." That's why that place is called "Gilgal" to this day.
06Jos 5:10 While the Israelites remained encamped at Gilgal on the plains of Jericho, they observed the Passover during the evening of the fourteenth day of the month. 
06Jos 5:11 On the day following Passover - on that exact day - they ate the produce of the land, unleavened cakes and parched grain. 
06Jos 5:12 The manna ceased on the day they ate the produce of the land. Since the Israelites no longer received manna, they ate crops from the land of Canaan that year.
06Jos 5:13 Now it happened that while Joshua was near Jericho, he looked up and much to his amazement, he saw a man standing in front of him, holding a drawn sword in his hand! Joshua approached him and asked him, "Are you one of us, or are you with our enemies?"5
06Jos 5:14 "Neither," he answered. "I have come as commander of the Lord's Army." Joshua immediately fell on his face to the earth and worshipped, saying to him, "Lord, what do you have for your servant by way of command?"5
06Jos 5:15 The commander of the Lord's Army replied to Joshua, "Remove your sandals from your feet, because the place where you're standing is holy." So Joshua did so.
06Jos 6:1 Meanwhile, Jericho was fortified inside and out because of the Israelites. Nobody could leave or enter.
06Jos 6:2 The Lord said to Joshua, "Look! I have given Jericho over to your control, along with its kings and valiant soldiers. 
06Jos 6:3 March around the city, all the soldiers circling the city once. Do this for six days, 
06Jos 6:4 with seven priests carrying in front of the ark seven trumpets made from rams' horns. On the seventh day march around the city seven times while the priests blow their trumpets. 
06Jos 6:5 When they sound a long blast with the ram's horn, as soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, then the entire army is to cry out loud, the city wall will collapse, and then all of the soldiers are to charge straight ahead."
06Jos 6:6 So Nun's son Joshua called for the priests. "Pick up the ark of the covenant," he told them, "and have seven priests carry seven trumpets made from rams' horns in front of the ark of the Lord."
06Jos 6:7 He said to the army, "Go out and encircle the city. Have the armed men march out in front of the ark of the Lord."
06Jos 6:8 And so, just as Joshua had commanded, seven of the priests went forward, carrying the seven trumpets made of rams' horns in the Lord's presence, blowing the trumpets while the ark of the covenant of the Lord followed them. 
06Jos 6:9 Armed men preceded the priests who were blowing the trumpets, and a rear guard followed the ark, while the trumpets continued to blow.
06Jos 6:10 Joshua issued orders to the army£º "You are not to shout or even let your voice be heard. Don't utter a word until I tell you to shout. Then shout!" 
06Jos 6:11 So the ark of the Lord was taken once around the city, then they went back to camp and spent the night there.
06Jos 6:12 Joshua got up early the next morning, and the priests picked up the ark of the Lord. 
06Jos 6:13 The seven priests who carried the seven trumpets made from rams' horns preceded the ark of the Lord, blowing their trumpets constantly. The armed men preceded them, and the rear guard followed the ark of the Lord, while the trumpets continued to blow. 
06Jos 6:14 On the second day they marched around the city once and then went back to camp. They did this for six days. 
06Jos 6:15 They rose early at dawn on the seventh day and marched around the city seven times, just as they had before, except that on that day only they marched around the city seven times.
06Jos 6:16 As they completed the seventh time, after the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua told the army, "Shout, because the Lord has given you the city! 
06Jos 6:17 The city - along with everything in it - is to be turned over to the Lord for destruction. Only Rahab the prostitute and everyone who is with her in her house may live, because she hid the scouts we sent. 
06Jos 6:18 Now as for you, everything has been turned over for destruction. Don't covet or take any of these things. Otherwise, you'll make the camp of Israel itself an object worthy of destruction, and bring trouble on it. 
06Jos 6:19 But everything made of silver and gold, and vessels made of bronze and iron are set apart to the Lord. They shall go into the treasury of the Lord."
06Jos 6:20 So the army shouted and the trumpets were blown again. As soon as the army heard the sound of the trumpets, they shouted loudly and the wall collapsed. The army charged straight ahead into the city and captured it. 
06Jos 6:21 They turned over everyone in the city for destruction and executed them, including both men and women, young and old, and oxen, sheep, and donkeys.
06Jos 6:22 Joshua told the two men who had scouted the land, "Go into the prostitute's home and bring her out of it, along with everyone who is with her, just as you promised her." 
06Jos 6:23 So the young men who had been scouts went in and brought Rahab out, along with her father, her mother, her brothers, and everyone else who was with her. They brought her entire family out and set them outside the camp of Israel.
06Jos 6:24 Then the army set fire to the city and to everything in it, except that they reserved the silver, gold, and vessels of bronze and iron for the treasury of the Lord. 
06Jos 6:25 But Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, along with her family and everyone who was with her. Her family has lived in Israel ever since, because she hid the scouts whom Joshua sent to observe Jericho.6
06Jos 6:26 Then Joshua made everyone take the following oath at that time. He said£º "Cursed in the presence of the Lord is the man who restores and rebuilds this city of Jericho! He shall lay its foundation at the cost of his firstborn, and at the cost of his youngest he shall set up its gates."
06Jos 6:27 So the Lord was with Joshua, and as a result, Joshua's reputation spread throughout the land.
06Jos 7:1 Later, the Israelites broke their promise regarding the things that had been turned over to destruction. Carmi's son Achan, grandson of Zabdi and great-grandson of Zerah from the tribe of Judah, appropriated some of the things that had been turned over to destruction. As a result, the Lord became angry with the Israelites.
06Jos 7:2 Meanwhile, Joshua had sent some soldiers from Jericho to Ai, which was near Beth-aven, east of Bethel. He ordered them, "Go up and scout the land." So the soldiers went up and scouted Ai and 
06Jos 7:3 returned to Joshua. "Not all of the people need to go up," they reported. "Only about two or three thousand men should attack Ai. Since they are so few, don't make all of the army work hard up there."
06Jos 7:4 So about three thousand went up there, but they ran away from the men of Ai. 
06Jos 7:5 The men of Ai killed about 36 of them, pursuing them outside the city gates as far as Shebarim, killing them as they descended. As a result, the army became terrified and lost their confidence. 
06Jos 7:6 At this, Joshua tore his clothes, fell down to the ground on his face before the ark of the Lord until evening - he and the leaders of Israel - and they covered their heads with dust. 
06Jos 7:7 "Lord God," Joshua asked, "Why have you brought this people across the Jordan River?To hand us over to the Amorites so we'll be destroyed?Wouldn't it have been better for us to be content to settle on the other side of the Jordan?
06Jos 7:8 Lord, what am I to say, now that Israel has run away from its enemies?
06Jos 7:9 The Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear of this, will surround us, and eliminate us from the earth! Then what will you do about your great reputation?"5
06Jos 7:10 "Get up!" the Lord replied to Joshua. "Why have you fallen on your face?
06Jos 7:11 Israel has sinned. They broke my covenant that I commanded them by taking some of the things that had been turned over to destruction. They have stolen, have been deceitful, and have stored what they stole among their own belongings. 
06Jos 7:12 The Israelites have been unable to stand before their enemies. They're turning their backs and running from their enemies because they themselves have been turned over to destruction. I will not be with you any more unless you destroy these things that have been turned over to destruction. 
06Jos 7:13 So get up and sanctify the people. Tell them, 'Sanctify yourselves in preparation for tomorrow, because this is what the Lord God of Israel, says£º "There are things turned over to destruction among you, Israel. You won't be able to defeat your enemies until you remove what has been turned over to destruction."'
06Jos 7:14 "Tomorrow morning you are to come forward tribe by tribe. The tribe that the Lord selects shall come forward by clans, the clan that the Lord selects shall come forward by households, and the household that the Lord selects shall come forward one by one. 
06Jos 7:15 The one selected as having taken what has been turned over to destruction shall be cremated, along with everything that pertains to him, because he has transgressed against the covenant of the Lord and committed an outrageous thing in Israel."
06Jos 7:16 So Joshua got up early that morning, brought Israel near tribe by tribe, and the tribe of Judah was selected. 
06Jos 7:17 He brought near the clans of Judah, and the Zerahite clan was selected. Then he brought near the Zerahite clan family by family, and the household of Zabdi was selected. 
06Jos 7:18 ext, he brought near his household one by one, and Carmi's son Achan, grandson of Zabdi and great-grandson of Zerah, was selected from the tribe of Judah.177
06Jos 7:19 Joshua then spoke to Achan, "My son, give glory and praise to the Lord God of Israel. Tell me right now what you did. Don't hide anything."
06Jos 7:20 Achan answered Joshua, "It's true. I'm the one who sinned against the Lord God of Israel. 
06Jos 7:21 I noticed among the war spoils a beautiful mantle from Shinar, 200 shekels of silver, and a bar of gold weighing 50 shekels. Because I wanted them, I took them, and they're buried in the ground inside my tent. The silver is underneath."
06Jos 7:22 So Joshua sent some messengers, who ran to the tent. And there it was, hidden in the tent with the silver underneath. 
06Jos 7:23 They took the things from the tent that had been turned over to destruction, brought them to Joshua and all of the Israelites, and lay them out in the presence of the Lord. 
06Jos 7:24 Then Joshua, with all Israel accompanying him, took Zerah's son Achan, along with the silver, the mantle, the gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and everything that belonged to him to the Valley of Achor.
06Jos 7:25 Joshua announced, "Why did you bring trouble to us?Today the Lord is bringing trouble to you!" So all Israel stoned him to death, cremated them, buried them with stones, 
06Jos 7:26 piling up a large mound of boulders that remains to this day. After this, the Lord turned his burning anger away, and that is why that place is called "the Valley of Achor" to this day.
06Jos 8:1 The Lord then said to Joshua, "Don't be afraid or lose heart! Take all the fighting men with you, and go up right now to Ai. Take note that I have handed over the king of Ai into your control, along with his people, his city, and his land. 
06Jos 8:2 Do to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king, but take its spoil and its livestock as war booty for yourselves. Set an ambush around the city."
06Jos 8:3 S  Joshua and all of the fighting men prepared to go out against Ai. Joshua selected 30,000 valiant warriors and sent them out by night, 
06Jos 8:4 telling them, "Pay attention now! You are to set up an ambush around the city. Don't go very far from the city, and all of you remain on alert. 
06Jos 8:5 I and all of the army with me will advance upon the city. When they come out after us like they did before, we'll run away from them. 
06Jos 8:6 They'll come after us until we've drawn them away from the city, because they'll say, 'They're running away from us just like they did before.' While we're running away from them, 
06Jos 8:7 you get up from the ambush and seize the city, because the Lord your God will give it into your control. 
06Jos 8:8 When you've taken the city, set it on fire, just as the Lord ordered. Look! These are your orders!" 
06Jos 8:9 So Joshua sent them out, and they set up an ambush between Bethel and Ai, to the west of Ai. Joshua spent that night in the camp among the army. 
06Jos 8:10 In the morning, Joshua got up early, mustered his army, and set off for Ai, accompanied by the elders of Israel in full view of the army. 
06Jos 8:11 The entire fighting force with him attacked, approaching the city, and camped on the north side of Ai, with a ravine between them and Ai. 
06Jos 8:12 Taking about 5,000 men, he set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai to the west of the city, 
06Jos 8:13 stationing their forces with its main encampment north of the city and its rear guard to the west. Joshua spent that night in the valley.
06Jos 8:14 When the king of Ai saw what had happened, he and his army quickly got up early and went out to meet Israel in battle; he and all his people met at the place adjacent to the desert plain. But he didn't know about the ambush that had been set for him on the other side of the city. 
06Jos 8:15 Because Joshua and the entire fighting force of Israel pretended to lose the battle by running away in front of them toward the wilderness, 
06Jos 8:16 everyone in the city followed after them. As they pursued Joshua, they were drawn away from the town. 
06Jos 8:17 There wasn't a single man left in Ai or Bethel who didn't run out after Israel. They left the city open and pursued Israel.
06Jos 8:18 Then the Lord said to Joshua, "Stretch out the battle lance that's in your hand toward Ai, because I will give it into your control." So Joshua stretched out the battle lance that was in his hand toward the city. 
06Jos 8:19 As soon as he stretched out his hand, the troops in ambush quickly got up from their place of hiding and attacked. They entered the city, seized it, and immediately set it on fire.
06Jos 8:20 Then the men of Ai looked back behind them. Look! Smoke from the city was rising into the sky. They were unable to run in any direction, because the Israelites who had fled toward the wilderness had turned around to attack their pursuers. 
06Jos 8:21 When Joshua and the entire fighting force of Israel observed that the men who had been in ambush had seized the city and that the smoke from the city was rising, they turned around and attacked the men of Ai. 
06Jos 8:22 Then the others came out from the city against them, so the men of Ai were surrounded by the Israelites, some on one side and some on the other. Israel attacked them until no one was left to survive or escape. 
06Jos 8:23 But the king of Ai was taken alive and brought to Joshua.
06Jos 8:24 When Israel had completed executing all of the residents of Ai in the open wilderness where they had chased them, and after all of them - to the very last of them - had been killed by swords, the entire fighting force of Israel returned to Ai and attacked it with swords. 
06Jos 8:25 The total of all who fell that day, including men and women, was 12,000 - the entire population of Ai. 
06Jos 8:26 Joshua did not cease his attack until he had completely destroyed every inhabitant of Ai. 
06Jos 8:27 Israel took only the livestock and the spoil of that city as their war booty, in accordance with what the Lord had commanded to Joshua. 
06Jos 8:28 Joshua burned Ai, turning it into a permanent ruin, and it remains so to this day. 
06Jos 8:29 He hanged the king of Ai on a tree until dusk, and at sunset Joshua ordered his body brought down from the tree and laid at the entrance to the gate of the town. There he raised over it a large mound of stones, which stands there to this day.827
06Jos 8:30 Then Joshua built an altar to the Lord, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal, 
06Jos 8:31 just the way Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded the Israelites in the book of the Law of Moses£º "¡¦an altar of uncut stones that hasn't been worked with iron tools¡¦" and they offered burnt offerings to the Lord on it, along with peace offerings.
06Jos 8:32 There Joshua inscribed on stones a copy of the Law of Moses that Moses had presented to the Israelites. 
06Jos 8:33 All Israel, both foreigners and citizens, together with their elders, officers, and judges, stood on opposite sides of the ark of the covenant of the Lord. Half stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half stood in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses, the Lord's servant had commanded at the first, so that they could bless the people of Israel.
06Jos 8:34 Afterwards, Joshua read all the words of the Law - both the blessings and the curses - according to everything written in the Book of the Law. 
06Jos 8:35 There wasn't one word of everything Moses had commanded that Joshua did not read in front of the entire assembly of Israel, including the women, their little ones, and the foreigners who lived among them.
06Jos 9:1 Eventually all the kings who reigned in the hill country across the Jordan River and in the low-lying coastlands of the Mediterranean Sea facing Lebanon heard about this. So the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites 
06Jos 9:2 united together as one to fight against both Joshua and Israel.1
06Jos 9:3 But when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 
06Jos 9:4 they took the initiative by preparing their provisions shrewdly£º they took tattered sacks for their donkeys, worn-out, torn, and mended wineskins, 
06Jos 9:5 worn-out, patched sandals for their feet, and worn-out clothes. All of their food was dried out and covered in mold. 
06Jos 9:6 Then they approached Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and addressed him and the Israelites, "We've arrived from a distant country, so please make a treaty with us right now."
06Jos 9:7 But the Israelites responded to the Hivites, "Perhaps you live in our midst. If this is so, how can we make a treaty with you?"
06Jos 9:8 So they responded to Joshua, "We are your servants." Joshua asked them, "Who are you?And where did you come from?"
06Jos 9:9 They answered, "Your servants have arrived from a very distant land, because of the reputation of the Lord your God, because we've heard a report about all that he did in Egypt, 
06Jos 9:10 along with all of what he did to the two Amorite kings who were beyond the Jordan River - that is, to King Sihon of Heshbon and to King Og of Bashan, who lived in Ashtaroth. 
06Jos 9:11 So our leaders and all of the inhabitants of our country told us, 'Take provisions along with you for your journey, go to meet them, and tell them, "We are your servants. Come now and make a treaty with us."' 
06Jos 9:12 Look at our bread£º it was still warm when we took it from our houses as our food for our journey on the very day we set out to come to you. But now, look how it's dry and moldy. 
06Jos 9:13 And these wineskins were new when we filled them, but look - now they're cracked. And our clothes and sandals are worn out from our very long journey."
06Jos 9:14 So the leaders of Israel sampled their provisions, but did not ask the Lord about it. 
06Jos 9:15 They made a treaty with them, guaranteeing their lives with a covenant, and the leaders of the congregation confirmed it with an oath to them.
06Jos 9:16 But three days after they had made the treaty with them, they learned that they were their neighbors and were living in their midst. 
06Jos 9:17 So the Israelites set out for their cities and three days later they reached their cities of Gibeon, Cherphirah, Beeroth, and Kiriath-jearim. 
06Jos 9:18 The Israelites did not attack them, because the leaders of the congregation had made an oath with them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. Nevertheless, the entire congregation grumbled against their leaders.916
06Jos 9:19 Then all of the leaders spoke to the entire congregation, "We have sworn to them in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, and we cannot touch them. 
06Jos 9:20 So this is what we'll do to them£º we'll let them live, so that wrath won't come upon us because of the oath that we swore to them."
06Jos 9:21 The leaders said to them, "Let them live." So they became wood cutters and water carriers for the entire congregation, which is what the leaders had decided concerning them.
06Jos 9:22 Joshua summoned the Gibeonites and asked them, "Why did you deceive us by saying 'We live far away from you,' even though you were, in fact, living in our midst?
06Jos 9:23 Now therefore you are under a curse. Some of you will always be slaves, wood cutters, and water carriers for the house of my God."
06Jos 9:24 They replied to Joshua, "Because your servants had been informed that the Lord your God had certainly commanded his servant Moses to give you the entire land and to destroy all of the inhabitants of the land before you. So we were terrified for our lives because of you. That's why we did this. 
06Jos 9:25 Now we're under your control£º do to us as it seems good and right in your opinion."
06Jos 9:26 So this is what Joshua did for them£º he saved them from the Israelites, and they did not kill them. 
06Jos 9:27 However, on that very day Joshua made them become wood cutters and water carriers for the congregation and for the Lord's altar in the place that he should choose, and this tradition continues to this day.
06Jos 10:1 King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem eventually heard how Joshua had conquered Ai, utterly destroying it, doing to Ai and its king the same thing that he had done to Jericho and its king, and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were now living among them. 
06Jos 10:2 So they were terrified, since Gibeon was a large city, comparable to one of the royal cities, was larger than Ai, and all of its men had been warriors.
06Jos 10:3 So King Adoni-zedek of Jerusalem sent word to King Hoham of Hebron, King Piram of Jarmuth, King Japhia of Lachish, and King Debir of Eglon. He told them, 
06Jos 10:4 "Come over and help me, and let's attack Gibeon, because it made a peace treaty with Joshua and the Israelites." 
06Jos 10:5 So the five kings of the Amorites - the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon - gathered their armies together and advanced with all of their armies toward Gideon, camped there, and laid siege to it.
06Jos 10:6 The Gibeonites sent word to Joshua at his camp in Gilgal£º "Don't abandon your servants. Come quickly, save us, and help us, because all of the kings of the Amorites who live in the hill country have attacked us." 
06Jos 10:7 So Joshua went up from Gilgal, along with his entire fighting force of mighty warriors with him.6
06Jos 10:8 The Lord said to Joshua, "Don't fear them, because I have handed them over to you. Not one of them will withstand you." 
06Jos 10:9 So after an all-night march from Gilgal, Joshua attacked them by surprise. 
06Jos 10:10 The Lord threw the Amorites into a panic right in front of the army of Israel, which then slaughtered many of them at Gibeon. The Israelite army chased them along the road that goes up to Beth-horon, striking them down as far as Azekah and Makkedah.
06Jos 10:11 While they were fleeing in front of Israel and descending the slope of Beth-horon, the Lord rained down huge hailstones on them as far as Azekah, and they died. More died because of the hailstones than were killed by the Israelites in battle. 
06Jos 10:12 Later that day, Joshua spoke to the Lord while the Lord was delivering the Amorites to the Israelites. This is what he said in the presence of Israel£º "Sun, be still over Gibeon Moon, stand in place in the Aijalon Valley"
06Jos 10:13 So the sun remained still and the moon stood in place until the nation settled their score with their enemies. This is recorded, is it not, in the book of Jashar?The sun stood in place in the middle of the sky and seemed not to be in a hurry to set for nearly an entire day.
06Jos 10:14 There has never been a day like it before or since, when the Lord listened to the voice of a man, because the Lord was fighting on behalf of Israel.
06Jos 10:15 After this, Joshua returned to the camp at Gilgal with the entire fighting force of Israel.
06Jos 10:16 Meanwhile, the five kings had fled and hidden themselves inside a cave at Makkedah. 
06Jos 10:17 Joshua was informed, "The five kings have been discovered hiding in the cave at Makkedah."
06Jos 10:18 So Joshua gave an order, "Roll large stones up against the mouth of the cave and assign men to stand guard there, 
06Jos 10:19 but don't stay there yourselves. Instead, pursue your enemies and attack them from behind. Don't allow them to enter their cities, because the Lord your God has delivered them into your control."
06Jos 10:20 Now it came about that after Joshua and the Israelites had finished the battle, destroying and scattering their survivors, who retreated into their fortified cities, 
06Jos 10:21 the entire army returned safely to Joshua's encampment at Makkedah. No one could speak so much as a single word against any of the Israelites.
06Jos 10:22 Then Joshua gave this order£º "Unseal the mouth of the cave and bring out these five kings to me from the cave."
06Jos 10:23 So they did. They brought out these five kings to him from within the cave£º the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. 
06Jos 10:24 When they had brought these kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel and spoke to the leaders of the men who had gone out to war along with him, "Come close and put your feet on the necks of these kings." So they came near and put their feet on their necks.
06Jos 10:25 Joshua said to the army, "Don't fear or be dismayed! Be strong and courageous, because this is how the Lord will treat all of your enemies whom you fight."
06Jos 10:26 After this, Joshua struck those kings down, executing them, and hanged them on five gallows until sunset. 
06Jos 10:27 When evening had come, Joshua gave a command to remove the bodies from the gallows and bury them in the cave where they had hidden. The army sealed the mouth of the cave with large stones that remain there to this very day.
06Jos 10:28 Joshua captured Makkedah that very day, and attacked both it and its king with swords, utterly destroying it along with every person in it, leaving no survivors. He dealt with the king of Makkedah the same way he had dealt with the king of Jericho.
06Jos 10:29 Afterward, Joshua and all of Israel passed on from Makkedah to Libnah, where they fought against Libnah. 
06Jos 10:30 The Lord gave both it and its king into the control of Israel, and Joshua executed both its king and every person in it with swords, leaving no survivors. He dealt with the king the same way he had dealt with the king of Jericho.
06Jos 10:31 Then Joshua and all of Israel passed from Libnah to Lachish, camped near it, and attacked it. 
06Jos 10:32 The Lord gave Lachish into the control of Israel, and Joshua captured it the next day. He declared war on the city and executed everyone in it, the same way he had treated Libnah.
06Jos 10:33 Then Horam king of Gezer appeared to help Lachish. So Joshua attacked him and his army, until he left no one remaining. 
06Jos 10:34 After this, Joshua, accompanied by all of Israel, proceeded from Lachish to Eglon, laid siege to it, and attacked it. 
06Jos 10:35 They captured it on that day, attacking it in battle. Then Joshua completely destroyed it that day, the same way he had dealt with Lachish.1033
06Jos 10:36 Then Joshua, accompanied by all of Israel, left Eglon for Hebron, where they attacked it, 
06Jos 10:37 captured it, and executed its inhabitants - its king, all of its cities, and every person in it, leaving no one remaining, the same way he had dealt with Eglon. He completely destroyed it, along with everyone in it.
06Jos 10:38 Then Joshua returned, accompanied by the entire fighting force of Israel, to Debir, where they attacked it, 
06Jos 10:39 captured it, its king, and all of its villages. They executed them, totally destroying it and everyone in it, leaving no one remaining. He dealt with Debir and its king just as he had dealt with Hebron, treating them the same way he had dealt with Libnah and its king.
06Jos 10:40 So Joshua conquered the entire land, the hill country, the Negev, the Shephelah, and the wilderness highlands, along with all of their kings. He left none of them remaining, but completely destroyed every living person, just as the Lord God of Israel had commanded. 
06Jos 10:41 Joshua conquered them from Kadesh-barnea to Gaza, including the entire territory of Goshen as far as Gibeon. 
06Jos 10:42 Joshua conquered all of these kings and their territories in one campaign, because the Lord God of Israel fought for Israel. 
06Jos 10:43 Then Joshua returned to the camp at Gilgal, along with the entire fighting force of Israel.
06Jos 11:1 When King Jabin of Hazor heard all of this, he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, to the king of Shimron, to the king of Achshaph, 
06Jos 11:2 and to the kings in the north, in the hill country, in the plain south of Kinnereth, in the Shephelah, and in the hills of Dor toward the west, 
06Jos 11:3 to the eastern and western Canaanites - the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites in the hill country, and the Hivites below Hermon in the territory of Mizpah. 
06Jos 11:4 So they went out, they and all of their armies with them - a multitude as numerous as the sand on the seashore - accompanied by many horses and chariots. 
06Jos 11:5 After all these kings had gathered together, they went out and camped together at the waters of Merom to fight Israel.
06Jos 11:6 But the Lord told Joshua, "Don't be afraid of them, because tomorrow about this time I am giving them all to you - dead - in the presence of Israel. Hamstring their horses and incinerate their chariots."
06Jos 11:7 So Joshua and his entire fighting force approached them suddenly by the waters of Merom and attacked them. 
06Jos 11:8 The Lord handed them over to the control of Israel, who defeated them and chased them as far as Greater Sidon and east as far as the Mizpah Valley. They attacked them until none remained. 
06Jos 11:9 Joshua dealt with them just as the Lord had told him£º he hamstrung their horses and incinerated their chariots.8
06Jos 11:10 Joshua then turned back and captured Hazor, executing its king, because Hazor used to be the head of all of those kingdoms. 
06Jos 11:11 They executed all of the people who lived in it, completely destroying and leaving no one alive. Then he burned Hazor in fire.
06Jos 11:12 So Joshua captured and annihilated all of these cities, along with their kings, completely destroying them, just as Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded. 
06Jos 11:13 However, Israel did not burn any of the cities that had been built on tels, except for Hazor only, which Joshua burned. 
06Jos 11:14 The Israelites took the spoils of war from these cities, along with their livestock, but they executed every human being until they had completely destroyed them, leaving no one alive. 
06Jos 11:15 Joshua did just what the Lord had commanded his servant Moses and just what Moses had commanded him, leaving nothing unfinished.
06Jos 11:16 So Joshua conquered all of these territories£º the hill country, all of the Negev, the entire land of Goshen with its foothills, the plains of Jordan, and the mountains of Israel with its foothills 
06Jos 11:17 from Mount Halak and the ascent toward Seir, including as far as Baal-gad in the Lebanon Valley that lies at the foot of Mount Hermon. Joshua captured all of their kings, struck them down, and put them to death. 
06Jos 11:18 Joshua fought an extended campaign against all those kings. 
06Jos 11:19 There wasn't a single city that made a peace accord with the Israelites, except the Hivites who lived in Gibeon. The Israelites captured all the rest in battle, 
06Jos 11:20 because the Lord had hardened their hearts so they would fight Israel in war, be completely destroyed without mercy, and be completely wiped out, as the Lord had commanded Moses.11
06Jos 11:21 At that time Joshua came and annihilated the Anakim from the hill country, that is, from Hebron, Debir, and Anab, as well as from all the hill country of Judah and Israel. Joshua completely destroyed them along with their cities. 
06Jos 11:22 None of the Anakim remained in the land belonging to the Israelites - they remained only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod. 
06Jos 11:23 Joshua conquered the entire land, in accordance with everything that the Lord had told Moses. Joshua presented it as an inheritance to Israel, dividing it according to tribal allotments. Then the land enjoyed rest from war.
06Jos 12:1 This is a list of the kings who ruled the land that the Israelites conquered, and whose territories they took on the other side of the Jordan River toward the east, from the Arnon River to Mount Hermon, along with the entire eastern Jordan plain. 
06Jos 12:2 Sihon king of the Amorites lived in Heshbon and ruled from Aroer, which is located on the edge of the Arnon River from the middle of the valley, including half of Gilead as far as Wadi Jabbok, the border of the Ammonites, 
06Jos 12:3 and toward the Arabah as far as the Sea of Galilee to the east, as far as the Arabah Sea (that is, the Dead Sea) to the east as one travels in the direction of Beth-jeshimoth, and to the south as far as the foothills of Pisgah. 
06Jos 12:4 The territory of Og king of Bashan was conquered. He was one of the last of the Rephaim, and lived at Ashtaroth and Edrei, 
06Jos 12:5 ruling over Mount Herman, Salecah, and all of Bashan as far as the border of the Geshurites, the Maacathites, and half of Gilead to the border of Sihon king of Hesbon.
06Jos 12:6 Moses, the servant of the Lord, and the Israelites defeated them. Then Moses, the servant of the Lord, gave it to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh as their inheritance. 
06Jos 12:7 This is a list of the kings of the land whom Joshua and the Israelites defeated beyond the Jordan River toward the west, from Baal-gad in the Lebanon valley as far as Mount Halak, which rises in the direction of Seir. Joshua gave it to Israel, distributing it according to their tribal divisions as their inheritance,
06Jos 12:8 in the mountain regions, in the Arabah, on the foothills, in the wilderness, in the Negev; that is, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Canaanites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:
06Jos 12:9 The king of Jericho£º 1 The king of Ai, which is near Bethel£º 1

06Jos 12:24 The king of Tirzah£º 1 Total number of all kings:12 31
06Jos 13:1 When Joshua had grown old, having lived many years, the Lord said to him, "You are old and have lived many years, but much of the land still remains to be possessed. 
06Jos 13:2 This territory remains£º all of the Philistine regions, including all Geshurite holdings 
06Jos 13:3 from the Shihor east of Egypt as far as the border of Ekron on the north (which is considered part of Canaan). This includes the five rulers of the Philistines£º the Gazites, the Ashdodites, the Ashkelonites, the Gittites, the Ekronites, and the Avvites.
06Jos 13:4 "To the south, there remains to be conquered all the territory held by the Canaanites, Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorites, 
06Jos 13:5 including the territory of the Gebalites and all of Lebanon facing the east from Baal-gad at the foot of Mount Hermon as far as Lebo-hamath, 
06Jos 13:6 and all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephot-maim, including all the Sidonians. I myself will drive them out in the presence of the Israelites. 
06Jos 13:7 You only have to allocate the land as an inheritance, just as I commanded you."
06Jos 13:8 The Reubenites and Gadites, along with the other half-tribe of Manasseh, received their inherited portion that Moses the servant of the Lord had given them to the east beyond the Jordan River. 
06Jos 13:9 Specifically included was from Aroer on the banks of the Wadi Arnon, and the town that lies in the middle of the valley, including all the plains from Medeba to Dibon, 
06Jos 13:10 all the cities pertaining to King Sihon of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the boundary of the Ammonite territory, 
06Jos 13:11 Gilead and the region belonging to the Geshurites and Maacathites, including all of Mount Herman, and all of Bashan as far as Salecah. 
06Jos 13:12 Also included was the entire kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei. (He was the sole survivor left of the Rephaim.) Although Moses had defeated these people and driven them out, 
06Jos 13:13 the Israelites did not drive out the Geshurites or the Maacathites - Geshur and Maacath live within the territory of Israel to this day.11
06Jos 13:14 Moses allotted no inheritance solely to the tribe of Levi. As he had mentioned to them, the offerings by fire to the Lord God of Israel are their inheritance.
06Jos 13:15 Moses allocated territory to the tribe of the descendants of Reuben according to their clans. 
06Jos 13:16 Their allocation was from the border of Aroer on the edge of the Arnon valley (including the city that is located in the valley, as well as the entire plain next to Medeba), 
06Jos 13:17 Heshbon and all of its cities that are on the plain, including Dibon, Bamoth-baal, Beth-baal-meon, 
06Jos 13:18 Jahaz, Kedemoth, Mephaath, 
06Jos 13:19 Kiriathaim, Sibmah, and Zereth-shahar on the hill in the valley, 
06Jos 13:20 Beth-peor, the slopes of Pisgah, Beth-jeshimoth, 
06Jos 13:21 all of the cities of the plain, the entire kingdom of King Sihon of the Amorites, who used to reign in Heshbon and whom Moses attacked, along with the chiefs of Midian, Evi, Rekem, Zur, Hur, and Reba, nobles of Sihon who lived in the land. 
06Jos 13:22 The Israelites also killed Beor's son Balaam, the occult practitioner, executing him by the sword as one of those killed. 
06Jos 13:23 The border of the Reubenites was the Jordan River and its banks. This was the inheritance belonging to the Reubenites, divided according to their families, cities, and villages.16
06Jos 13:24 Moses also allocated territory to the tribe of Gad, that is, to the descendants of Gad, according to their families. 
06Jos 13:25 Their territory included Jazer, all the cities of Gilead, half the land of the Ammonites as far as Aroer which is located near Rabbah, 
06Jos 13:26 from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mispeh and Betonim, from Mahanaim as far as the border of Debir, 
06Jos 13:27 the valley containing Beth-haram, Beth-nimrah, Succoth, and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of King Sihon of Heshbon, with the Jordan River as its border as far as the southern end of the Sea of Galilee beyond the Jordan River to the east. 
06Jos 13:28 This was the inheritance belonging to the Gadites according to their clans, cities, and villages.1327
06Jos 13:29 Moses also allocated territory to the half-tribe of Manasseh, that is, for the half-tribe of the Manassites according to their clans. 
06Jos 13:30 Their territory extended from Mahanaim to include all of Bashan, all of the kingdom of King Og of Bashan, all of the 60 towns of Jair there in Bashan, 
06Jos 13:31 half of Gilead, including Ashtaroth and Edrei. The cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan went to half of the descendants of Manasseh's son Machir, according to their clans. 
06Jos 13:32 These were the allotments that Moses apportioned for an inheritance in the plains of Moab beyond the Jordan River east of Jericho.
06Jos 13:33 Moses allotted no inheritance to the tribe of Levi. The Lord God of Israel is their inheritance, as he promised them.
06Jos 14:1 This is what the Israelites inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, Nun's son Joshua, and the heads of the families of the Israelites allotted to them as an inheritance 
06Jos 14:2 by lot, just as the Lord commanded through Moses for the nine tribes and the half-tribe, 
06Jos 14:3 since Moses had given the inheritance of the two tribes and the half-tribe across the Jordan River. However, he did not give an inheritance to the Levites who lived among them, 
06Jos 14:4 since the descendants of Joseph constituted two tribes - Manasseh and Ephraim. They did not allot a portion to the Levites in the land, since they were given cities to live in, along with pastures for their livestock and property. 
06Jos 14:5 So the Israelites did just as the Lord had commanded Moses - they divided the land.
06Jos 14:6 After this, the descendants of Judah approached Joshua in Gilgal. Jephunneh the Kenizzite's son Caleb said to him, "You know the promise that the Lord gave Moses the man of God concerning the two of us in Kadesh-barnea. 
06Jos 14:7 I was 40 years old when Moses the servant of the Lord sent me from Kadesh-barnea to scout the land. I brought back an honest report to him. 
06Jos 14:8 As it happened, my fellow Israelites who went up with me terrified the people, but I fully followed the Lord my God. 
06Jos 14:9 Moses made a promise to me on that day when he said, 'The land that you covered on foot will certainly be your inheritance. It will belong to your descendants forever, because you have fully followed the Lord my God.'147
06Jos 14:10 "Look how the Lord has let me survive, as you can see, these 45 years since the time when the Lord said this through Moses, while Israel was wandering through the wilderness. And look! I'm here today - my eighty-fifth birthday! 
06Jos 14:11 I'm still as strong today as I was the day Moses commissioned me. I'm as strong today as I was then, and I can go out to battle and come back successful. 
06Jos 14:12 Now then, give me that hill country about which the Lord spoke back on that day, because you yourself heard back then that the Anakim were there, with great reinforced cities. Perhaps the Lord will be with me and I will expel them, just as the Lord said."11
06Jos 14:13 So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Jephunneh's son Caleb for his inheritance. 
06Jos 14:14 Therefore Hebron became the inheritance of Jephunneh the Kenizzite's son Caleb, and it remains so today, because he fully followed the Lord God of Israel. 
06Jos 14:15 Hebron used to be known as Kiriath-arba, after the greatest man among the Anakim. After all of this, the land enjoyed rest from war.14
06Jos 15:1 Joshua said, "Now the allotment for the tribe of the descendants of Judah, allocated according to their families, will extend to the border of Edom, southward to the wilderness of Zin until land's end, 
06Jos 15:2 then from the southern end of the Dead Sea, that is, from the bay that orients toward the Negev 
06Jos 15:3 proceeding south to the ascent of Akrabbim, then continuing to Zin, and from there up along the south of Kadesh-barnea to Hezron, and from there up to Addar and then to Karka, 
06Jos 15:4 passing along to Azmon toward the Wadi of Egypt and ending at the sea. This will be your southern border."3
06Jos 15:5 The eastern border was the Dead Sea as far as the mouth of the Jordan River. The border of the north side extended from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan River 
06Jos 15:6 toward Beth-hoglah, and continuing on the north of Beth-arabah. The border ascended up to the boundary marker set up by Reuben's son Bohan.
06Jos 15:7 The boundary then went up to Debir from the Achor valley and turned north toward Gilgal opposite the ascent of Adummim in the southern part of the valley. Then the border continued to the waters of En-shemesh and terminated at En-rogel. 
06Jos 15:8 Then the border proceeded up the valley of Ben-hinnom to the southern ascent of the Jebusites (that is, to Jerusalem), and from there to the top of the mountain that faces the valley of Hinnom to the west at the end of the valley of Rephaim toward the north.
06Jos 15:9 The border proceeded from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah, then to the cities of Mount Ephron, and then the border curved toward Baalah (also known as Kireath-jearim). 
06Jos 15:10 The border turned west from Baalah to Mount Seir, continuing to the top of Mount Jearim on the north (also known as Chesalon), and then proceeded to Beth-shemesh, continuing through Timnah.
06Jos 15:11 The border proceeded north to the edge of Ekron, then curved to Shikkeron and on to Mount Baalah, proceeding then to Jabneel, where the boundary ended at the sea. 
06Jos 15:12 The western border was at the Mediterranean Sea coastline. This is the border that surrounded the territory of the descendants of Judah, according to their families.
06Jos 15:13 Now Joshua gave an allotment among the descendants of Judah to Jephunneh's son Caleb, just as God told Joshua, Kiriath-arba, which was named after the ancestor of Anak (that is, Hebron). 
06Jos 15:14 From there Caleb drove the three descendants of Anak, Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmi, the Anakim. 
06Jos 15:15 Then he went up from there to attack the inhabitants of Debir. (Debir was formerly known as Kiriath-sepher.)
06Jos 15:16 Then Caleb announced, "I will give my daughter Achsah in marriage to the one who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it." 
06Jos 15:17 Othniel, the son of Caleb's brother Kenaz, captured it, so Caleb gave him his daughter Achsah as his wife. 
06Jos 15:18 Sometime later, she came to Othniel and persuaded him to ask her father for a field. As she dismounted from her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What do you want?"
06Jos 15:19 She replied, "Give me a blessing, since you have given me the land of the Negev. Give me also some springs of water." So he gave her the upper and lower springs.
06Jos 15:20 Here's a list of cities allotted for the tribe of the descendants of Judah according to their families£º 
06Jos 15:21 The cities to the far south of the tribe of the descendants of Judah (toward the border of Edom in the south) included Kabzeel, Eder, Jagur, 
06Jos 15:22 Kinah, Dimonah, Adadah, 
06Jos 15:23 Kedesh, Hazor, Ithnan,

06Jos 15:30 Eltolad, Chesil, Hormah, 
06Jos 15:31 Ziklag, Madmannah, Sansanaah, 
06Jos 15:32 Lebaoth, Shilhim, Ain, and Rimmon, for a total of 29 cities and villages.
06Jos 15:33 The lowland cities included Eshtaol, Zorah, Ashnah, 
06Jos 15:34 Zanoah, Engannim, Tappuach, Enam, 
06Jos 15:35 Jarmuth, Adullam, Socoh, Azekah, 
06Jos 15:36 Shaaraim, Adithaim, Gederah, and Gederothaim, for a total of fourteen cities and villages.
06Jos 15:37 Also included were Zenan, Hadashah, Migdal-gad,

06Jos 15:42 Also included were Libnah, Ether, Ashan, 
06Jos 15:43 Iphtah, Ashnah, Nezib, 
06Jos 15:44 Keilah, Achzib, and Mareshah, for a total of nine cities and villages.
06Jos 15:45 Also included were Ekron, with its towns and villages, 
06Jos 15:46 from Ekron to the Mediterranean Sea, including everything by the edge of Ashdod, along with their villages, 
06Jos 15:47 Ashdod and its towns and villages, Gaza and its towns and villages as far as the River of Egypt, and the coastline of the Mediterranean Sea.15
06Jos 15:48 The hill country included Shamir, Jattir, Socoah, 
06Jos 15:49 Dannah, Kiriath-sannah (also known as Debir), 
06Jos 15:50 Anab, Eshtemoh, Anim, 
06Jos 15:51 Goshen, Holon, Giloh, for a total of eleven cities and villages. 
06Jos 15:52 Also included were Arab, Dumah, Eshan, 
06Jos 15:53 Janum, Beth-tappuach, Aphekah, 
06Jos 15:54 Humtah, Kiriath-arba (also known as Hebron), and Zior, for a total of nine cities and villages. 
06Jos 15:55 Also included were Maon, Carmel, Zeph, Juttah, 
06Jos 15:56 Jezreel, Jokdeam, Zanoah, 
06Jos 15:57 Kain, Gibeah, and Timnah, for a total of ten cities and villages. 
06Jos 15:58 Also included were Halhul, Beth-zur, Gedor, 
06Jos 15:59 Maarath, Beth-anoth, and Eltekon, for a total of six cities and villages. 
06Jos 15:60 Also included were Kiritah-baal (also known as Kiriath-jearim) and Rabbah, for a total of two cities and villages.
06Jos 15:61 The wilderness included Beth-arabah, Middin, Secacah, 
06Jos 15:62 Nibshan, Salt City, and Engedi, for a total of six cities and villages.
06Jos 15:63 Now as for the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, the descendants of Judah could not expel them, so Jebusites live with the descendants of Judah in Jerusalem to this day.
06Jos 16:1 The territorial allotment for the descendants of Joseph proceeded from the Jordan River by Jericho eastward of the waters of Jericho, into the wilderness, proceeding from Jericho through the hill country of Bethel 
06Jos 16:2 and from Bethel to Luz, continuing to the border of the Archites at Ataroth. 
06Jos 16:3 It proceeded westward to the territory of the Japhletites as far as the territory of lower Beth-horon, then toward Gezer, ending at the Mediterranean Sea.
06Jos 16:4 Manasseh and Ephraim, the descendants of Joseph, received their inheritance.
06Jos 16:5 This was the territory allocated to the descendants of Ephraim according to their families£º the border of their inheritance on the east was Ataroth-addar as far as upper Beth-horon. 
06Jos 16:6 Then the border proceeded west from Michmethath on the north, then turned east toward Taanath-shiloh, continuing to the east of Janoah. 
06Jos 16:7 It proceeded from Janoah to Ataroth, then to Naarah, then proceeded to Jericho and ended at the Jordan River. 
06Jos 16:8 From Tappuach, the border proceeded west to the Kanah brook, ending at the Mediterranean Sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the descendants of Ephraim according to their families, 
06Jos 16:9 along with the cities that had been set aside for the descendants of Ephraim within the allotment of the descendants of Manasseh, including all of the cities and villages. 
06Jos 16:10 However, they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites live within the territory of Ephraim to this day, but they serve as forced laborers.
06Jos 17:1 The territorial allotment for the tribe of Manasseh, the first born of Joseph, was allocated first to Machir the first born of Manasseh and father of Gilead. Since he had been a man of war, Gilead and Bashan were allocated to him.
06Jos 17:2 Now allotments were made with respect to the remaining descendants of Manasseh according to their families£º for the descendants of Abiezer, the descendants of Helek, the descendants of Asriel, the descendants of Shechem, the descendants of Hepher, and the descendants of Shemida - the male descendants of Joseph's son Manasseh, according to their families.
06Jos 17:3 Hepher's son Zelophehad, grandson of Gilead and great-grandson of Manasseh's son Machir had no sons, only daughters. These are the names of his daughters£º Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 
06Jos 17:4 They appeared before Eleazar the priest and Nun's son Joshua and declared, "The Lord commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our relatives." So in keeping what the Lord had commanded, he gave them an inheritance among their ancestor's relatives.
06Jos 17:5 That is why ten allotments fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan beyond the Jordan River, 
06Jos 17:6 since the granddaughters of Manasseh received an inheritance along with his sons. (The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the Manassites.)
06Jos 17:7 The border of Manasseh proceeded from Asher to Michmethath east of Shechem, then turned south to include the inhabitants of En-tappuach. 
06Jos 17:8 (The territory of Tappuach belonged to Manasseh, but Tappuach itself, on the border of Manasseh, was allocated to the Ephraimites.) 
06Jos 17:9 The border proceeded to the Kanah brook and proceeded south. These cities belonged to Ephraim among the cities of Manasseh, with the border of Manasseh on the north of the brook, terminating at the Mediterranean Sea.8
06Jos 17:10 The southern area was allocated to Ephraim and the northern area to Manasseh. The Mediterranean Sea was the border, extending to Asher on the North and to Issachar on the east. 
06Jos 17:11 In Issachar and Asher, Manasseh held Beth-shean and its towns, Ibleam and its towns, the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns, and the three coastal districts. 
06Jos 17:12 The descendants of Manasseh did not take possession of these cities, because the Canaanites predominated in that territory. 
06Jos 17:13 Later on, when the Israelites had become strong, they forced the Canaanites to work for them, but they never did expel them completely. 1711
06Jos 17:14 At that time, the descendants of Joseph asked Joshua, "Why did you give us only one allotment and portion for an inheritance, since we're numerous and the Lord has blessed us all along?"
06Jos 17:15 So Joshua replied to them, "Since you're so numerous, go up to the forest and clear ground there for yourselves in the territory where the Perizzites and Rephaim are, because the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you."
06Jos 17:16 The descendants of Joseph replied, "The hill country isn't sufficient for us, but all the Canaanites who live on the plain have iron chariots, both those in Beth-shean and its villages as well as the inhabitants of the Jezreel Valley."
06Jos 17:17 So Joshua said to the tribes of Joseph, which were Ephraim and Manasseh, "You're truly a numerous group, and you have great power. You are not to have only one allotment, 
06Jos 17:18 but the hill country shall also belong to you. Even though it's a forest, you will clear it and possess it to its farthest borders. You'll drive out the Canaanites, even though they have iron chariots and even though they're strong."
06Jos 18:1 After this, the entire assembly of the Israelites gathered together at Shiloh and set up a Tent of Meeting there, where the land lay conquered before them. 
06Jos 18:2 Seven tribes remained among the Israelites for whom their inheritances had not yet been allocated.1
06Jos 18:3 So Joshua said to the Israelites, "How long will you delay invading and taking possession of the land that the Lord God of your ancestors has given you?
06Jos 18:4 Appoint three men from each tribe and I'll send them. They'll begin to go through the land and record a description of it, categorized according to their inheritance, and then they'll report back to me. 
06Jos 18:5 They'll divide it seven ways. Judah will stay in its territory on the south and the house of Joseph will remain in its territory on the north. 
06Jos 18:6 Lay out the land in seven divisions, then bring your report here to me. I will then cast lots in the presence of the Lord our God. 
06Jos 18:7 The Levites have no allotment among you, since the priesthood of the Lord is their inheritance. Gad, Reuben, and the half-tribe of Manasseh received their inheritance to the east, beyond the Jordan River given to them by Moses the servant of the Lord."6
06Jos 18:8 So the men started out, following Joshua's command to those who went to scout the land, "Go through the land and record a description of it, and then return to me. I will then cast lots in the presence of the Lord your God in Shiloh." 
06Jos 18:9 Then the men left camp and went throughout the land, describing its cities in a book with seven divisions. Then they returned to Joshua at the camp at Shiloh. 
06Jos 18:10 Joshua threw lots in Shiloh in the Lord's presence and divided the land accordingly among the Israelites according to their divisions.
06Jos 18:11 The allotment of the tribe of the Benjaminites came up according to their families, and their territorial allotment fell between the descendants of Judah and the descendants of Joseph. 
06Jos 18:12 Their border started on the north side at the Jordan River, proceeded to the slope of Jericho on the north, then westward through the hill country, and terminated at the wilderness of Beth-aven. 
06Jos 18:13 From there the boundary proceeded south in the direction of Luz to the slope of Luz (also known as Bethel), then proceeded to Ataroth-addar, on the mountain that lies south of Lower Beth-horon. 
06Jos 18:14 From there the boundary changes direction, turning southward on the western side opposite Beth-horon, terminating at Kiriath-baal (also known as Kiriath-jearim), which belongs to Judah. This forms the western boundary.1813
06Jos 18:15 The southern boundary begins at the edge of Kiriath-jearim, proceeding from there to Ephron and then to the spring at the Nephtoah Waters. 
06Jos 18:16 From there the boundary proceeds to the border of the mountain that overlooks the Ben-Hinnom Valley at the northern end of the Rephaim Valley, where it proceeds down the Hinnom Valley south of the slope of the Jebusites toward En-rogel. 
06Jos 18:17 Then it turns north toward En-shemesh and proceeds from there to Geliloth opposite the ascent of Adummin, where it turns toward the Stone of Bohan, Reuben's son, 
06Jos 18:18 and proceeds north of the slope of Beth-arabah down to the Arabah. 
06Jos 18:19 From there the boundary proceeds to north of the slope of Beth-hoglah and terminates at the northern bay of the Salt Sea where the Jordan River ends in the south. This is the southern border. 
06Jos 18:20 The Jordan River forms its boundary on the east. This is the inheritance for the tribe of Benjamin according to its families, boundary by boundary around the entire territory.
06Jos 18:21 The towns belonging to the tribe of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho, Beth-hoglah, Emek-keriz, 
06Jos 18:22 Beth-arabah, Zemaraim, Bethel, 
06Jos 18:23 Avvim, Parah, Ophrah, 
06Jos 18:24 Chephar-ammoni, Ophni, and Geba, for a total of twelve towns and villages. 
06Jos 18:25 Also included were Gibeon, Ramah, Beeroth, 
06Jos 18:26 Mizpeh, Chephirah, Mozah, 
06Jos 18:27 Rekem, Irpeel, Taralah, 
06Jos 18:28 Zela, Haeleph, Jebus (also known as Jerusalem), Gibeah, and Kiriath-jearim, for a total of fourteen towns and villages. This is the inheritance of the tribe of Benjamin according to their families.1824
06Jos 19:1 The second lottery went to the tribe of Simeon according to its families. Its inheritance was enclosed within the inheritance of the tribe of Judah. 
06Jos 19:2 Its inheritance included Beer-sheba, Sheba, Moladah, 
06Jos 19:3 Hazar-shual, Balah, Ezem, 
06Jos 19:4 Eltolad, Bethul, Hormah, 
06Jos 19:5 Ziklag, Beth-marcaboth, Hazar-susah, 
06Jos 19:6 Beth-lebaoth, and Sharuhen, for a total of thirteen towns and villages. 
06Jos 19:7 Also included were Ain, Rimmon, Ether, and Ashan, for a total of four towns and villages. 
06Jos 19:8 Also included were all the surrounding villages as far as Baalath-beer, in Ramah of the Negev. This was the inheritance of the tribe of Simeon according to its families. 
06Jos 19:9 The inheritance of the tribe of Simeon was contained in part of the territory of Judah; that is, because the portion allotted to the tribe of Judah was large enough for both tribes, the tribe of Simeon obtained an inheritance within that of Judah.7
06Jos 19:10 The third lottery went to the tribe of Zebulun according to its families. The boundary of its inheritance extended to Sarid, 
06Jos 19:11 then turned westward toward Maralah, proceeding to Dabbesheth, and then to the valley that is east of Jokneam. 
06Jos 19:12 From Sarid it proceeded back eastward, creating a sunrise boundary at Chisloth-tabor, and proceeded from there to Daberath, then to Japhia, 
06Jos 19:13 from which it proceeded toward the east to Gath-hepher, then to Eth-kazin, then going to Rimmon, where it turned toward Neah. 
06Jos 19:14 On the north of Neah, the boundary turned toward Hannathon, terminating at Iphtah-el Valley 
06Jos 19:15 and Kattath, Nahalal, Shimron, Idalah, and Bethlehem, for a total of twelve towns and villages. 
06Jos 19:16 These towns and villages are the inheritance of the tribe of Zebulun according to its families.12
06Jos 19:17 The fourth lottery went to the tribe of Issachar according to its families. 
06Jos 19:18 The territorial allotment included Jezreel, Chesulloth, Shunem, 
06Jos 19:19 Hapharaim, Shion, Anaharath,

06Jos 19:21 Remeth, En-gannim, En-haddah, Beth-pazzez, 
06Jos 19:22 with the boundary including Tabor, Shahazumah, and Beth-shemesh. The boundary terminated at the Jordan River, for a total of sixteen towns and villages. 
06Jos 19:23 These towns and villages comprise the inheritance of the tribe of Issachar, according to its families.
06Jos 19:24 The fifth lottery went to the tribe of Asher according to its families. 
06Jos 19:25 The territorial boundary included Helkath, Hali, Beten, Achshaph, 
06Jos 19:26 Allammelech, Amad, and Mishal, and on the west Carmel and Shihor-libnath, 
06Jos 19:27 then proceeded east to Beth-dagon. It proceeded to Zebulun and the Iphtah-el Valley, turned north to Beth-emek and Neiel, then proceeded north to Cabul, 
06Jos 19:28 Ebron, Rehob, Hammon, and Kanah as far as Great Sidon. 
06Jos 19:29 There the boundary turned toward Ramah, reaching to the fortress city of Tyre and turned to Hosah, where it terminated at the Mediterranean Sea. Also included were Mahalab,?Achzib, 
06Jos 19:30 Ummah, Aphek, and Rehob, for a total of 22 towns and villages. 
06Jos 19:31 These towns and villages are the inheritance of the tribe of Asher according to its families.27
06Jos 19:32 The sixth lottery went to the tribe of Naphtali according to its families. 
06Jos 19:33 The territorial boundary proceeded from Heleph, the oak in Zaanannim, and Adami-nekeb, and Jabneel as far as Lakkum, terminating at the Jordan River. 
06Jos 19:34 There the boundary proceeded west to Aznoth-tabor and then to Hukkok, reaching Zebulun at the south, Asher on the west, and Judah on the east at the Jordan River. 
06Jos 19:35 Also included were the fortress towns of Ziddim, Zer, Hammath, Rakkath, Chinnereth, 
06Jos 19:36 Adamah, Ramah, Hazor, 
06Jos 19:37 Kedesh, Edrei, En-hazor, 
06Jos 19:38 Iron, Migdal-el, Horem, Beth-anath, and Beth-shemesh, for a total of nineteen towns and their villages. 
06Jos 19:39 These towns and villages comprised the inheritance of the tribe of Naphtali according to its families.
06Jos 19:40 The seventh lottery went to the tribe of Dan according to its families. 
06Jos 19:41 The territorial allotment included Zorah, Eshtaol, Ir-shemesh, 
06Jos 19:42 Shaalabbin, Aijalon, Ithlah, 
06Jos 19:43 Elon, Timnah, Ekron, 
06Jos 19:44 Eltekeh, Gibbethon, Baalath, 
06Jos 19:45 Jehud, Bene-berak, Gath-rimmon, 
06Jos 19:46 Me-jarkon, and Rakkon at the border near Joppa. 
06Jos 19:47 Later, when the Danites lost their territory, they went up and attacked Leshem. After they captured it and executed its inhabitants, they took possession of it and settled there, renaming the city of Leshem to Dan in memory of their ancestor Dan. 
06Jos 19:48 These towns and villages comprised the inheritance of the tribe of Dan according to their families.
06Jos 19:49 When the Israelites had completed distribution of the various territories of the land as inheritances, they provided an inheritance to Nun's son Joshua. 
06Jos 19:50 By a command from the Lord, they allocated the town that he requested, Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. He rebuilt the town and settled there. 
06Jos 19:51 These are the inheritances that Eleazar the priest, Nun's son Joshua, and the heads of the families of the Israelite tribes distributed by lot in the Lord's presence at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. So they finished dividing the land.
06Jos 20:1 Then the Lord said to Joshua, 
06Jos 20:2 "Tell the people of Israel, 'Set apart cities of refuge about which I spoke to you through Moses, 
06Jos 20:3 so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally and without premeditation may run there and be protected from closely related avengers. 
06Jos 20:4 He may run to one of those cities, stand at the entrance of the city gate, and tell his side of the story to the elders of the city. They shall bring him inside the city with them and provide him a place to live among them.203
06Jos 20:5 "'Now if the closely related avenger pursues him, then they are not to hand the killer over to him, because he killed his neighbor without premeditation and without hating him beforehand. 
06Jos 20:6 He shall live in that city until he stands trial before the community, until the death of the one who is high priest at that time. Then the killer may return to his own city and to his own home, that is, to the city from which he fled.'"
06Jos 20:7 So they set apart Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (also known as Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 
06Jos 20:8 East of Jericho beyond the Jordan River, they reserved Bezer in the wilderness on the plain from the tribe of Reuben, Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh. 
06Jos 20:9 These were appointed to be cities for all the Israelites and for the foreigner who lives among them, so that whoever kills anyone unintentionally may run there and not die at the hands of a closely related avenger until he stands for trial before the community.
06Jos 21:1 Then the family leaders of the Levites approached Eleazar the priest and Nun's son Joshua, along with the family leaders of the people of Israel. 
06Jos 21:2 It was at Shiloh in the land of Canaan that they told them, "The Lord ordered through Moses that we be given cities in which to live, along with their pasture lands for our livestock."
06Jos 21:3 So, just as the Lord had said, the Israelites set aside cities for the Levites from a portion of their own inheritances, along with their grazing lands. 
06Jos 21:4 The lottery went to the families of the Kohathites. So the descendants of Aaron the priest, who were Levites, received thirteen cities by random lot from the tribes of Judah, Simeon, and Benjamin. 
06Jos 21:5 The rest of the descendants of Kohath received ten cities by random lot from the families of the tribes of Ephraim, Dan, and the half-tribe of Manasseh.
06Jos 21:6 The descendants of Gershon received thirteen cities by random lot from the families of the tribes of Issachar, Asher, Naphtali, and from the half-tribe of Manasseh located in Bashan. 
06Jos 21:7 The descendants of Merari, allocated according to their families, received twelve cities from the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and Zebulun.
06Jos 21:8 The Israelites apportioned these cities, along with their pasture lands, to the Levites by random lot, just as the Lord had commanded through Moses.
06Jos 21:9 From the tribes of the descendants of Judah and Simeon, they gave these cities, delineated by name£º 
06Jos 21:10 for the descendants of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites, of the descendants of Levi, since the lot fell in their favor first. 
06Jos 21:11 They gave them Kiriath-arba, also known as Hebron, (Arba was named after the ancestor of Anak), in the hill country of Judah, along with its surrounding pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:12 But the fields adjoining the city and its surrounding villages were given to Jephunneh's son Caleb.
06Jos 21:13 So they gave Hebron to the descendants of Aaron the priest to serve as a city of refuge for unintentional killers, along with its pasture lands, Libnah with its pasture lands, 
06Jos 21:14 Jattir with its pasture lands, Eshtemoa with its pasture lands, 
06Jos 21:15 Holon with its pasture lands, Debir with its pasture lands, 
06Jos 21:16 Ain with its pasture lands, Juttah with its pasture lands, and Beth-shemesh with its pasture lands, for a total of nine cities from these two tribes.
06Jos 21:17 From the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasture lands, Geba with its pasture lands, 
06Jos 21:18 Anathoth with its pasture lands, and Almon with its pasture lands, for a total of four cities. 
06Jos 21:19 All of the cities allocated to the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, numbered thirteen, along with their pasture lands.
06Jos 21:20 Cities from the tribe of Ephraim were also allotted to the families of the descendants of Kohath, that is, to the rest of the descendants of Kohath, who were Levites. 
06Jos 21:21 Shechem was allocated to them as a city of refuge for unintentional killers, along with its pasture lands, in the mountainous region of Ephraim, Gezer with its pasture lands, 
06Jos 21:22 Kibzaim with its pasture lands, and Beth-horon with its pasture lands, for a total of four cities.
06Jos 21:23 From the tribe of Dan were allocated Elteke with its pasture lands, Gibbethon with its pasture lands, 
06Jos 21:24 Aijalon with its pasture lands, and Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands, for a total of four cities.
06Jos 21:25 From the half-tribe of Manasseh were allocated Taanach with its pasture lands and Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands, for a total of two cities. 
06Jos 21:26 All the cities with their pasture lands for the families of the rest of the descendants of Kohath numbered ten.
06Jos 21:27 To the descendants of Gerson (one of the Levitical families) from the half-tribe of Manasseh were allocated Golan in Bashan as a city of refuge for unintentional killers, along with its pasture lands, and Beeshterah with its pasture lands, for a total of two cities.
06Jos 21:28 From the tribe of Issachar were allocated Kishion with its pasture lands, Daberath with its pasture lands, 
06Jos 21:29 Jarmuth with its pasture lands, and En-gannin with its pasture lands, for a total of four cities.
06Jos 21:30 From the tribe of Asher were allocated Mishal with its pasture lands, Abdon with its pasture lands, 
06Jos 21:31 Helkath with its pasture lands, and Rebo with its pasture lands, for a total of four cities.
06Jos 21:32 From the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with its pasture lands were allocated as a city of refuge for the unintentional killer, Hammoth-dor with its pasture lands, and Kartan with its pasture lands, for a total of three cities.
06Jos 21:33 All the cities of the descendants of Gershon according to their families totaled thirteen, including their pasture lands.
06Jos 21:34 From the tribe of Zebulon were allocated to the descendants of Merari (that is, the rest of the Levites) Jokneam with its pasture lands, Kartah with its pasture lands, 
06Jos 21:35 Dimnah with its pasture lands, and Nahalal with its pasture lands, for a total of four cities.
06Jos 21:36 From the tribe of Reuben were allocated Bezer with its pasture lands, Jazah with its pasture lands, 
06Jos 21:37 Kedemoth with its pasture lands, and Mephaath with its pasture lands, for a total of four cities.
06Jos 21:38 From the tribe of Gad were allocated Ramoth in Gilead with its pasture lands, to serve as a city of refuge for the unintentional killer, Mahanaim with its pasture lands, 
06Jos 21:39 Heshbon with its pasture lands, and Jazer with its pasture lands, for a total of four cities in all.
06Jos 21:40 So the entire allocation to the descendants of Merari (that is, the rest of the families of the Levites) according to their families totaled twelve cities.
06Jos 21:41 All of the cities of the Levites that had been set apart among the territorial possession of the Israelites totaled 48, along with their pasture lands. 
06Jos 21:42 These cities were each surrounded by pasture lands, as was the case with all of these cities.
06Jos 21:43 So the Lord gave all of the land to Israel that he had promised to give their ancestors, and they took possession and settled there in it. 
06Jos 21:44 The Lord gave them peace all around them, just as he had promised their ancestors. Not one of their enemies was able to oppose them - the Lord placed all of their enemies under their control. 
06Jos 21:45 Not one of the good promises that the Lord had made to the house of Israel failed - all of them came about.
06Jos 22:1 Later, Joshua called together the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh 
06Jos 22:2 and told them, "You have done everything that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you, and you have listened to me in everything that I commanded you. 
06Jos 22:3 You haven't abandoned your relatives these past days to the present, and you have met the obligation contained in the commands of the Lord your God.
06Jos 22:4 Now the Lord has given peace to your relatives, just as he told them. Therefore, proceed to your tents - to the land that is yours to possess - that Moses the servant of the Lord gave you east of the Jordan River. 
06Jos 22:5 Only be very careful to keep the commands and the Law that Moses the servant of the Lord commanded you - that is, to love the Lord your God, to follow in all of his ways, to keep his commands, to stay close to him, and to serve him with all your heart and soul." 
06Jos 22:6 That's how Joshua blessed them. Then he sent them on their way and they returned to their tents.4
06Jos 22:7 Now Moses had made an allotment in Bashan to one half-tribe of Manasseh, but Joshua made an allotment west of the Jordan River to the other half-tribe of their relatives. So when Joshua sent them on their way back to their tents, he also blessed them by saying 
06Jos 22:8 "Return to your tents with great wealth, plenty of livestock, silver, gold, bronze, iron, and lots of clothing. Divide the spoil from your enemies among your relatives."
06Jos 22:9 The Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh went back to the land of Gilead, leaving the Israelites at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, for their territorial possession that they had inherited in accordance with the command of the Lord given through Moses.
06Jos 22:10 After they arrived at an area of the Jordan River that is in the land of Canaan, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh constructed an altar there by the Jordan River, and it was very large. 
06Jos 22:11 When the Israelites heard about it, they announced, "Look here, the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have constructed an altar in Canaan's frontier district of the Jordan River, on the side apportioned to the Israelites." 
06Jos 22:12 When the Israelites heard that announcement, the entire community of the Israelites gathered together at Shiloh in preparation for war.11
06Jos 22:13 Then the Israelites sent a delegation to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead. They sent Eleazar's son Phinehas the priest, 
06Jos 22:14 and ten officials with him (one for each of the tribal families of Israel, each one of them a family leader among the clans of Israel). 
06Jos 22:15 They approached the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh in the land of Gilead and said to them£º 
06Jos 22:16 "This is what the entire community of the Lord has to say£º 'What is this treacherous act by which you have acted deceitfully against the God of Israel by turning away from following the Lord today, and by building yourselves an altar today, so you can rebel against the Lord?
06Jos 22:17 Isn't the evil that happened at Peor enough for us, from which we have yet to be completely cleansed even to this point, and because of which a plague came upon the community of the Lord?
06Jos 22:18 Now then, are you turning away from following the Lord today?If you rebel against the Lord today, by tomorrow he will be angry with the entire community of Israel. 
06Jos 22:19 If the land of your inheritance remains unclean, then cross back over into the land that the Lord possesses, and receive an inheritance among us. Don't rebel against the Lord and against us by constructing an altar for yourselves besides the altar of the Lord our God. 
06Jos 22:20 Didn't Zerach's son Achan act treacherously with respect to the things banned by God, and as a result God became angry at the entire community of Israel?And that man was not the only one to die because of his iniquity.'"
06Jos 22:21 The Reubenites, Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered the officials of the clans of Israel, 
06Jos 22:22 "The God of gods, the Lord, the God of gods, the Lord is the One who knows! And may Israel itself be aware that if this was an act of rebellion or an act of treachery against the Lord, may he not deliver us today! 
06Jos 22:23 If we have built an altar for ourselves intended to turn us away from following the Lord, or to offer burnt offerings, grain offerings, or peace offerings on it, may the Lord himself demand an accounting from us! 
06Jos 22:24 But we did this because we were concerned for a reason, since we thought, 'Some time in the future your descendants may say to our descendants, "What do you have in common with the Lord, the God of Israel?
06Jos 22:25 The Lord has established the Jordan River to be a territorial border between us and you. Reubenites and Gadites have no allotment from the Lord." So your descendants may cause our descendants to stop fearing the Lord.'
06Jos 22:26 "That's why we said, 'Let's build an altar for ourselves, not for burnt offerings or sacrifice, 
06Jos 22:27 but instead it will serve as a reminder between us and you and between our generations after us, that we are to serve the Lord with our burnt offerings, sacrifices, and peace offerings. That way your descendants will not say to our descendants in the future, "You have no allotment from the Lord."'
06Jos 22:28 "That's also why we said, 'It may be if they say these things to us and to our descendants in the future, so we will respond, "Look at this replica of the altar of the Lord that our ancestors made, not for burnt offerings or sacrifice, but rather as a reminder between us and you. 
06Jos 22:29 May we never rebel against the Lord today by building an altar for burnt offerings, for grain offerings, or for sacrifice to replace the altar of the Lord our God which stands before his Tabernacle."'"
06Jos 22:30 When Phinehas the priest, the leaders of the community, and the heads of the families of Israel who were with him heard what the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the Manassites said, they were pleased. 
06Jos 22:31 So Eleazar's son Phinehas the priest replied to the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the Manassites, "Today we've demonstrated that the Lord is among us, because you have not acted treacherously against the Lord. Now you have delivered the Israelites from the anger of the Lord."
06Jos 22:32 So Eleazar's son Phinehas the priest and the leaders returned from the Reubenites, the Gadites, and from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan and to the people of Israel, bringing back word to them. 
06Jos 22:33 What they said pleased the people of Israel, so they blessed God and said no more about going up to attack them in war and to destroy the land where the Reubenites and the Gadites were living. 
06Jos 22:34 The Reubenites and the Gadites named the altar "Witness," because they claimed, "It stands as a witness between us that the Lord is God."2232
06Jos 23:1 Many years later, after the Lord had given peace between Israel and all its surrounding enemies, and after Joshua had become very old, 
06Jos 23:2 Joshua called together all Israel, including their leaders, officials, judges, and tribal officers. He told them, "I am old now after having lived many years. 
06Jos 23:3 You have seen everything that the Lord your God has done to all of these nations on your behalf, because it has been the Lord your God who has been fighting on your behalf. 
06Jos 23:4 Now look, I have allocated these nations that remain as an inheritance for your tribes, including all of the nations that I have eliminated, from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea to the west. 
06Jos 23:5 The Lord your God will expel them in front of you, driving them out of your sight. You will take possession of this land, just as the Lord your God promised you.2
06Jos 23:6 "Stand very strong, then, so you can obey and carry out everything written in the book of the Law of Moses, turning neither to the right nor to the left of it. 
06Jos 23:7 That way, you will not mingle with those nations that remain among you, nor mention the name of their gods, nor make oaths by them, nor serve them, nor worship them. 
06Jos 23:8 Instead, you are to hold fast to the Lord your God, as you have done today, 
06Jos 23:9 because the Lord has expelled great and strong nations ahead of you. Now as for you, not a single man has been able to oppose you right to this day. 
06Jos 23:10 A single man makes a thousand flee, because the Lord your God is the One who is fighting for you, just as he promised you.239
06Jos 23:11 "So be very diligent to love the Lord your God, 
06Jos 23:12 because if you ever turn back and cling to those who remain of these nations by intermarrying with them and associating one with another, 
06Jos 23:13 know for certain that the Lord your God will not continue to drive out these nations ahead of you. Instead, they will be a snare and a trap for you, a whip to your backs, and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land that the Lord your God has given you.
06Jos 23:14 "Look here£º today I'm going down the path that everyone on earth takes, and you know with all your hearts and souls that not a single word of all of the good things that the Lord your God spoke about you has failed to happen. Everything has been fulfilled about you - not one of them has failed. 
06Jos 23:15 However, just as all of the good things have come about that the Lord your God promised, so also the Lord will bring upon you all of the threats until he has destroyed you from possessing this good land that he has given you. 
06Jos 23:16 When you break the covenant of the Lord your God that he commanded you to obey by going to serve other gods and worship them, then the anger of the Lord will blaze against you, and you will perish quickly from this good land that he gave you."2314
06Jos 24:1 Then Joshua assembled together all of the tribes of Israel at Shechem. He called for the leaders, officials, judges, and tribal officers of Israel. They assembled in formation before God, 
06Jos 24:2 and Joshua told all of the people, "This is what the Lord God of Israel has to say£º 'Long ago your ancestors lived beyond the Euphrates River, including Terah, father of both Abraham and Nahor, where they served other gods. 
06Jos 24:3 Then I took your ancestor Abraham from the other side of the Euphrates River and led him through the entire land of Canaan. I multiplied his descendants, and gave him his son Isaac.
06Jos 24:4 'I gave Jacob and Esau to Isaac. And I gave Mount Seir to Esau as his possession, but Jacob and his children went down to Egypt.
06Jos 24:5 'Later I commissioned Moses and Aaron, and I inflicted plagues on Egypt by what I did among them. Afterwards, I brought all of you out.
06Jos 24:6 'Then I brought your ancestors out of Egypt, and you came to the Sea, and the Egyptians followed your ancestors with chariots and horsemen to the Reed Sea. 
06Jos 24:7 But when they cried out to the Lord, he placed darkness between you and the Egyptians, brought the sea upon the Egyptians, and swallowed them up. Your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. Then you lived in the desert for a long time.
06Jos 24:8 'I brought you into the territory of the Amorites, who lived on the other side of the Jordan River. They fought you, but I gave them into your control, and you took possession of their land. I destroyed them from your presence.
06Jos 24:9 'Then Zippor's son, King Balak of Moab, showed up and fought against Israel. He sent word to Balaam, summoning Beor's son to put a curse on you. 
06Jos 24:10 But I wasn't willing to listen to Balaam. So he had to bless you, and I delivered you from his control.
06Jos 24:11 'Next, you crossed the Jordan River and arrived at Jericho. But the citizens of Jericho fought you, as did the Amorites, Perizzites, Canaanites, Hittites, Girgashites, Hivites, and the Jebusites, so I gave them into your control.
06Jos 24:12 'Then I sent hornets ahead of you to drive out two kings of the Amorites before you without your using either sword or bow. 
06Jos 24:13 I gave you a land for which you never worked and cities that you didn't build but that you have lived in. You're eating from vineyards and olive groves that you didn't plant.'
06Jos 24:14 "Now you must fear the Lord and serve him in faithfulness and truth. Throw away the gods that your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates River and in Egypt. Instead, serve the Lord. 
06Jos 24:15 If you think it's the wrong thing for you to serve the Lord, then choose for yourselves today whom you will serve - the gods whom your ancestors served on the other side of the Euphrates River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose territories you are living. But as for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.14
06Jos 24:16 In response, the people said, "Far be it from us that we should abandon the Lord to serve other gods, 
06Jos 24:17 since the Lord our God is the One who brought us and our ancestors up from the land of Egypt, from a life of slavery. He did those great things right in front of us, preserving us along the way that we traveled and among all the peoples through whose territory we passed. 
06Jos 24:18 The Lord expelled all the people before us, including the Amorites who lived in the land. Therefore, we also will serve the Lord, for he is our God."
06Jos 24:19 So Joshua said to the people, "You will not be able to serve the Lord, because he is a God of Holiness. He is a jealous God, and he will forgive neither your transgressions nor your sins. 
06Jos 24:20 If you abandon the Lord and serve foreign deities, then he will turn and do you harm, consuming you after all the good he has done for you."
06Jos 24:21 "No," the people replied to Joshua. "We will serve the Lord."
06Jos 24:22 Joshua responded, "You are giving testimony against yourselves, that you have chosen to serve the Lord." They replied, "We are witnesses!"
06Jos 24:23 Joshua said, "Therefore abandon the foreign gods that are among you, and turn your hearts to the Lord, the God of Israel."
06Jos 24:24 The people replied, "We will serve the Lord our God and obey his voice."
06Jos 24:25 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, making statutes and ordinances in Shechem. 
06Jos 24:26 He wrote these words in the book of the Law of God, took a large stone, moved it under the shade of the oak tree that was near the sanctuary of the Lord, 
06Jos 24:27 and then said to all of the people, "Look! This stone will testify for us, because it has heard everything that the Lord has spoken to us. So it will stand as a witness against you in the event that you deny your God." 
06Jos 24:28 Then Joshua dismissed the people, and each man returned to his territorial inheritance.
06Jos 24:29 Some time later, Joshua servant of the Lord died at the age of 110 years, and 
06Jos 24:30 they buried him in his territorial inheritance at Timnath-serah in the mountainous region of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash.
06Jos 24:31 Israel served the Lord for the entire lifetimes of Joshua and of the officials who outlived Joshua, that is, the ones who had personally known everything that the Lord had done for Israel.
06Jos 24:32 They also buried the bones of Joseph, which the Israelites brought up from Egypt, in the parcel of ground at Shechem that Jacob had purchased from the descendants of Shechem's father Hamor, for 100 pieces of silver. It became part of the inheritance of the descendants of Joseph.
06Jos 24:33 Later, Aaron's son Eleazar also died, and they buried him at Gibeah, which belonged to his son Phinehas, and which had been given to him in the mountainous region of Ephraim.
07
07Jdg 1:1 Sometime after Joshua had died, the Israelites asked the Lord, "Who is to lead us against the Canaanites in our opening attack against them?"
07Jdg 1:2 The Lord replied, "The tribe of Judah is to lead you. Look! I've given the land into their control."
07Jdg 1:3 But the tribe of Judah said to the tribe of Simeon, the descendants of Judah's brother, "Come with us into our territory, and we'll both fight the Canaanites. In return, we'll go with you when you fight in your territory." So the army of the tribe of Simeon accompanied the army of the tribe of Judah.
07Jdg 1:4 When the army of the tribe of Judah went into battle, the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their control, and they defeated 10,000 men at Bezek. 
07Jdg 1:5 They located Adoni-bezek in Bezek, fought him, and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 
07Jdg 1:6 Adoni-bezek ran off, but they pursued him, caught him, and amputated his thumbs and big toes. 
07Jdg 1:7 Adoni-bezek used to brag, "Seventy kings without thumbs and big toes used to eat what was left under my table. God has repaid me for what I've done." They brought him to Jerusalem, and he later died there.
07Jdg 1:8 Then the army of Judah attacked Jerusalem, captured it, executed its inhabitants, and set fire to the city. 
07Jdg 1:9 Later, the army of Judah left Jerusalem to attack the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, the Negev, and the Shephelah. 
07Jdg 1:10 They attacked the Canaanites who inhabited Hebron (formerly known as Kiriath-arba) and fought Sheshai, Ahiman, and Talmai.
07Jdg 1:11 The army of Judah then proceeded to attack the inhabitants of Debir, which used to be known as Kiriath-sepher. 
07Jdg 1:12 Caleb announced, "I'll give my daughter Achsah in marriage to whomever leads the attack against Kiriath-sepher and captures it." 
07Jdg 1:13 Othniel, Caleb's nephew through his younger brother Kenaz, captured the city, so Caleb awarded him his daughter Achsah in marriage.
07Jdg 1:14 Later on, after she had arrived, she urged Othniel to ask her father for a field. As she got off her donkey, Caleb asked her, "What do you want for yourself?"
07Jdg 1:15 "I want this blessing from you," she replied. "Since you've given me land in the Negev, give me water springs, too." So Caleb gave her both the upper and lower springs.
07Jdg 1:16 The descendants of the Kenites, the tribe from which Moses' father-in-law came, accompanied the descendants of Judah from the city of the palms to the Judean wilderness, which is in the desert area south of Arad, and lived with the people there. 
07Jdg 1:17 The army of Judah accompanied the army of Simeon, Judah's brother, as they attacked the Canaanites who were living in Zephath, and they completely destroyed it. Then they renamed the city Hormah. 
07Jdg 1:18 The army of Judah captured Gaza and its territory, Ashkelon and its territory, and Ekron and its territory. 
07Jdg 1:19 The Lord was with the army of Judah, and they captured the hill country, but did not expel the inhabitants of the valley because they were equipped with iron chariots.
07Jdg 1:20 They gave Hebron to Caleb, just as Moses had promised, and he drove out the three sons of Anak from there. 
07Jdg 1:21 However, the Benjaminites did not expel the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived with the Benjaminites in Jerusalem to this day.
07Jdg 1:22 Then the army of the tribe of Joseph attacked Bethel, and the Lord was with them. 
07Jdg 1:23 The army of the tribe of Joseph scouted out Bethel, which had been formerly named Luz. 
07Jdg 1:24 The scouts observed a man coming out of the city and they promised him, "Please show us the entrance to the city and we'll deal kindly with you." 
07Jdg 1:25 So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they attacked the city with swords, but they let the man and his entire family escape. 
07Jdg 1:26 So the man traveled to the land of the Hittites and built a city that he named "Luz," and it is called by that name to this day.
07Jdg 1:27 The army of the tribe of Manasseh did not conquer Beth-shean and its villages, Taanach and its villages, the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages. Instead, the Canaanites continued to live in that land. 
07Jdg 1:28 When Israel had grown strong, they subjected the Canaanites to conscripted labor and never did expel them completely.
07Jdg 1:29 The army of the tribe of Ephraim did not expel the Canaanites who were living in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.
07Jdg 1:30 The army of the tribe of Zebulun did not expel the inhabitants of Kitron or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them, but were subjected to conscripted labor.
07Jdg 1:31 The army of the tribe of Asher did not expel the inhabitants of Acco nor the inhabitants of Sidon, Ahlab, Achzib, Helbah, Aphik, or Rehob. 
07Jdg 1:32 So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites who continued to inhabit the land, because they did not expel them.
07Jdg 1:33 The army of the tribe of Naphtali did not expel the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and the inhabitants of Beth-anath. Instead, they lived among the Canaanites who inhabited the land. However, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and Beth-anath were subjected to conscripted labor.
07Jdg 1:34 Later on, the Amorites forced the Danites into the hill country and did not permit them to come into the valleys of the hills. 
07Jdg 1:35 Furthermore, the Amorites continued to inhabit Mount Heres in Aijalon and Shaalbim. Eventually, however, after the tribe of Joseph had become strong, the Amorites were subjected to conscripted labor. 
07Jdg 1:36 The Amorite border extended upward from the Akrabbim Ascent, that is, from Sela.135
07Jdg 2:1 Some time later, the angel of the Lord came up from Gilgal to Bochim and announced to Israel, "I brought you up from Egypt and led you into the land that I promised to your ancestors. I had said to them, 'I'll never breach my covenant with you. 
07Jdg 2:2 As for you, you must not make any treaties with the inhabitants of this land. Instead, tear down their altars.' But you haven't obeyed me. What have you done?
07Jdg 2:3 Therefore I'm now saying, 'I won't expel them before you. Instead, they'll remain at your side, and their gods will ensnare you.'"
07Jdg 2:4 Because the angel of the Lord said these things to all of the Israelites, the people wept out loud, 
07Jdg 2:5 which is why they named the place Bochim. And there they sacrificed to the Lord. 
07Jdg 2:6 After Joshua had dismissed the people, the Israelites returned to their respective inheritances to take possession of the land.
07Jdg 2:7 The people served the Lord during the entire lifetime of Joshua as well as the lifetimes of all the elders who outlived Joshua and who had observed all the great deeds that the Lord had done for Israel. 
07Jdg 2:8 But then Nun's son Joshua, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110 years. 
07Jdg 2:9 They buried him in Timnath-heres, within the boundaries of his inheritance in the mountainous region of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 
07Jdg 2:10 After that whole generation had died, another generation grew up after them that was not acquainted with the Lord or with what he had done for Israel.7
07Jdg 2:11 So the Israelites practiced what the Lord considered to be evil by worshiping Canaanite deities. 
07Jdg 2:12 They abandoned the Lord God of their ancestors, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods from among the gods of the peoples who surrounded them. They bowed down in worship of them, and by doing so angered the Lord. 
07Jdg 2:13 As a result, they abandoned the Lord by serving both Baal and Ashtaroth. 
07Jdg 2:14 So in his burning anger against Israel, the Lord gave them into the domination of marauders who plundered them. The enemies who surrounded the Israelites controlled them, and they were no longer able to withstand their adversaries. 
07Jdg 2:15 Wherever they went, the Lord worked against them to bring misfortune, just as the Lord had warned, and just as the Lord had promised them. As a result, they suffered greatly.12
07Jdg 2:16 Then the Lord raised up leaders, who delivered Israel from domination by their marauders. 
07Jdg 2:17 But they didn't listen to their leaders, because they were committing spiritual immorality by following other gods and worshiping them. They quickly turned away from the road on which their ancestors had walked in obedience to the commands of the Lord. They didn't follow their example. 
07Jdg 2:18 As a result, whenever the Lord raised up leaders for them, the Lord remained present with their leader, delivering Israel from the control of their enemies during the lifetime of that leader. The Lord was moved with compassion by their groaning that had been caused by those who were oppressing and persecuting them. 
07Jdg 2:19 However, after the leader had died, they would relapse to a condition more corrupt than their ancestors, following other gods, serving them, and worshiping them. They would not abandon their activities or their obstinate lifestyles.
07Jdg 2:20 In his burning anger against Israel, the Lord said, "Because the people have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their ancestors to keep, and because they haven't obeyed me, I'm also going to stop expelling any of the nations that remained after Joshua died. 
07Jdg 2:22 That way, I'll use them to demonstrate whether or not Israel will keep the Lord's lifestyle by walking on that road like their ancestors did." 
07Jdg 2:23 So the Lord caused those nations to remain and did not expel them quickly. He did not give them into Joshua's control.221
07Jdg 3:1 Here's a list of nations that the Lord caused to remain in order to test Israel (that is, everyone who had not gained any battle experience in Canaan) 
07Jdg 3:2 only so that successive Israelite generations, who had not known war previously, might come to know it by experience. 
07Jdg 3:3 These nations included the five lords of the Philistines, all of the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived in Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath. 
07Jdg 3:4 They remained there to test Israel, to reveal if they would obey the commands of the Lord that he issued to their ancestors through Moses.
07Jdg 3:5 The Israelites continued to live among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, 
07Jdg 3:6 taking their daughters as wives for themselves, giving their own daughters to their sons, and serving their gods. 
07Jdg 3:7 The Israelites kept on practicing evil in full view of the Lord. They forgot the Lord their God and served Canaanite male and female deities. 
07Jdg 3:8 Then in his burning anger against Israel, the Lord delivered them to domination by King Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim. So the Israelites served Cushan-rishathaim for eight years.
07Jdg 3:9 When the Israelites cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up Othniel son of Caleb's younger brother Kenaz, to deliver them, and he did. 
07Jdg 3:10 The Spirit of the Lord was on him, and he governed Israel. When Othniel went out to battle, the Lord handed king Cushan-rishathaim of Aram-naharaim into his control, and Othniel's domination of Cushan-rishathaim was strong. 
07Jdg 3:11 As a result, the land was quiet for 40 years. Then Kenaz' son Othniel died.
07Jdg 3:12 The Israelites again practiced evil in full view of the Lord. So the Lord strengthened Eglon king of Moab in his control over Israel, because they had practiced evil in full view of the Lord. 
07Jdg 3:13 Eglon assembled together the Ammonites and the Amalekites, proceeded to attack Israel, and captured the cities of palms. 
07Jdg 3:14 So the Israelites served king Eglon of Moab for eighteen years.12
07Jdg 3:15 But when the Israelites cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up Gera's son Ehud, a left-handed Benjaminite, as a deliverer for them. The Israelites paid tribute through him to king Eglon of Moab. 
07Jdg 3:16 Ehud forged a double-edged sword that was one and a half feet long, tied it to his right thigh under his cloak, 
07Jdg 3:17 and went to present the tribute to king Eglon of Moab. Now Eglon happened to be a very obese man.
07Jdg 3:18 As he finished presenting the tribute, Ehud sent away the people who had been carrying it. 
07Jdg 3:19 He had turned away from the idols that were at Gilgal. So he told Eglon, "I have a secret message for you, king." King Eglon responded "Silence!" and all of his attendants left him.
07Jdg 3:20 Ehud approached him while he was sitting by himself in the cool roof chamber of his palace. He said, "I have a message from God for you!" So when Eglon got up from his seat, 
07Jdg 3:21 Ehud used his left hand to take the sword from his right thigh and then plunged it into Eglon's abdomen. 
07Jdg 3:22 The hilt also penetrated along with the sword blade, and Eglon's fat closed in over the blade. Because he did not withdraw the sword from Eglon's abdomen, the sword point exited from Eglon's entrails.
07Jdg 3:23 Then Ehud left the cool chamber in the direction of the vestibule, shutting and locking the doors behind him. 
07Jdg 3:24 After he left, Eglon's attendants came to look, but the doors to the cool chamber were locked! So they said, "He must be relieving himself in the inner part of the cool chamber." 
07Jdg 3:25 They waited until they were embarrassed, since he never opened the doors to the chamber. Eventually they took a key, opened the doors, and found their master dead on the ground.3
07Jdg 3:26 Meanwhile, Ehud escaped while they were delayed, passed by the idols, and escaped in the direction of Seirah. 
07Jdg 3:27 When he arrived there, he sounded a trumpet in the mountainous region of Ephraim. While the Israelite army accompanied Ehud from the mountainous regions, 
07Jdg 3:28 he told them, "Attack them, because the Lord has given your enemies - the Moabites - into your control." So the Israelite army followed after him, seized the fords of the Jordan River opposite Moab, and did not allow anyone to cross. 
07Jdg 3:29 At that time they attacked about 10,000 Moabites, all of whom were strong and valiant men. Not one man escaped. 
07Jdg 3:30 As a result, Moab was subdued under the control of Israel, and the land remained quiet for 80 years.
07Jdg 3:31 After Ehud, Anath's son Shamgar attacked 600 Philistines with a cattle prod. He also delivered Israel.
07Jdg 4:1 After Ehud had died, while the Lord was watching, the Israelites made the evil they had been practicing even worse, 
07Jdg 4:2 so the Lord turned them over to domination by Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. Sisera, the commanding officer of his army, lived in Harosheth-ha-goiim. 
07Jdg 4:3 The Israelites cried out to the Lord, because of his 900 iron chariots. Jabin oppressed the Israelites forcefully for twenty years.
07Jdg 4:4 Deborah, a woman, prophet, and wife of Lappidoth, was herself judging Israel during that time. 
07Jdg 4:5 She regularly took her seat under the Palm Tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the mountainous region of Ephraim, where the Israelites would approach her for decisions. 
07Jdg 4:6 She sent word to Abinoam's son Barak from Kedesh-naphtali, summoning him. She asked him, "The Lord God of Israel has commanded you, hasn't he?He told you, 'Go out, march to Mount Tabor, and take 10,000 men with you from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun. 
07Jdg 4:7 I will draw out Sisera, the commanding officer of Jabin's army, along with his chariots and troops, to the Kishon River, where I will drop him right into your hands.'"
07Jdg 4:8 "If you'll go with me, I'll go," Barak replied. "But if you won't go with me, then I'm not going."
07Jdg 4:9 She responded, "I will surely go with you, but the road that you're about to take will not lead to honor for you. The Lord will sell Sisera into the hands of a woman." Then Deborah got up and went with Barak toward Kedesh. 
07Jdg 4:10 Barak called out the army of the tribes of Zebulun and Naphtali to march on Kedesh, and 10,000 men went out to war with him, along with Deborah.
07Jdg 4:11 Meanwhile, Heber the Kenite had been separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Moses' father-in-law Hobab. He had pitched his tents far away, near the Elon-bezaanannim. 
07Jdg 4:12 Furthermore, Sisera had been informed that Abinoam's son Barak had marched on Mount Tamor. 
07Jdg 4:13 So Sisera gathered his iron chariots together from Harosheth-ha-goiim - all 900 of them, along with all the people who were assigned to them - and they assembled at the Kishon River.12
07Jdg 4:14 "Get going!" Deborah said to Barak. "Because today's the day when the Lord has dropped Sisera into your hands! Look! The Lord has already gone out ahead of you!" So Barak left Mount Tabor, followed by 10,000 men, 
07Jdg 4:15 and the Lord threw Sisera, all the chariots, and his entire army into a panic right in front of Barak. Then Sisera abandoned his chariot and escaped on foot 
07Jdg 4:16 while Barak chased the chariots and army as far as Harosheth-ha-goyiim. Sisera's entire army died in the battle - not even one soldier remained.4
07Jdg 4:17 Meanwhile, Sisera had escaped on foot to a tent belonging to Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite, since there was peace between Jabin king of Hazor and the household of Heber the Kenite. 
07Jdg 4:18 Jael went out to greet Sisera. "Turn aside, sir!" she told him. "Turn aside to me! Don't be afraid." So he turned aside to her and entered her tent, where she concealed him behind a curtain.
07Jdg 4:19 He asked her, "Please give me some water to drink, because I'm thirsty." Instead, she opened a leather container of milk, gave him a drink, and then covered him up. He told her, "Stand in the doorway of the tent, and if anyone comes and asks 'Is anybody here?' say 'No'."
07Jdg 4:21 But Heber's wife Jael grabbed a tent peg in one hand and a hammer in the other, crept up to him quietly, and drove the tent peg right through his temple into the ground below after he had fallen sound asleep from exhaustion. That's how he died.
07Jdg 4:22 Meanwhile, as Barak continued chasing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him. "Come with me," she told him, "and I'll show you the man you're looking for!" So he went with her, and there was Sisera, lying dead with the tent peg still embedded in his temple!
07Jdg 4:23 That's how God subdued Jabin, king of Canaan right in front of the Israelites that day. 24And the Israelites gained greater control over King Jabin of Canaan until they had eliminated him.
07Jdg 5:1 Later that day, Deborah and Abinoam's son Barak celebrated by singing this song:
07Jdg 5:2 "When hair grows long in Israel, when the people give themselves willingly, bless the Lord!
07Jdg 5:3 Listen, you kings! Turn your ears to me, you rulers! As for me, to the Lord I will sing! I will sing praise to the Lord God of Israel.
07Jdg 5:4 Lord, when you left Seir, when you marched out from the grain field of Edom,       the earth quaked and the heavens poured out rain; indeed, the clouds poured out water.
07Jdg 5:5 Mountains tremble at the presence of the Lord  - even Sinai! - at the presence of the Lord God of Israel.
07Jdg 5:6 During the lifetime of Anath's son Shamgar and during the lifetime of Jael       highways remained deserted, while travelers kept to back roads.
07Jdg 5:7 Rural populations plummeted in Israel; until I, Deborah, arose; until I - an Israelite mother - arose.
07Jdg 5:8 New gods were chosen, then war came to the city gates, but there wasn't a shield or spear to be seen among 40,000 soldiers of Israel.
07Jdg 5:9 My heart is for the commanders of Israel, to those who work willingly among the people. Bless the Lord!
07Jdg 5:10 "Speak up, you who ride white donkeys, sitting on cloth saddles while you travel on your way!
07Jdg 5:11 From the sound of those who divide their work loads at the watering troughs, there they will retell the righteous deeds of the Lord, the righteous victories for his rural people in Israel." Then the people of the Lord went down to the gates.
07Jdg 5:12 "Wake up! Wake up, Deborah! Wake up! Wake up, Deborah! Get up, Barak, and dispose of your captives, you son of Abinoam!
07Jdg 5:13 Then the survivors approached the nobles; the people of the Lord approached me in battle array.
07Jdg 5:14 Some came from Ephraim who had been harassed by Amalek, followed by Benjamin with your people. Some commanders came from Machir, along with some from Zebulun who carry a badge of office.
07Jdg 5:15 The officials of Issachar were with Deborah, as was the tribe of Issachar and Barak. They rushed out into the valley at his heels along with divisions from Reuben's army. Great was their resolve of heart!
07Jdg 5:16 Why did you sit down among the sheepfolds?To hear the bleating of the flocks?Among the divisions of the army of Reuben there was great searching of heart. 
07Jdg 5:17 The tribe of Gilead remained on the other side of the Jordan River. As for the tribe of Dan, why did they stay on board their ships?The tribe of Asher sat by the seashore and remained near its harbors.
07Jdg 5:18 The tribe of Zebulun did not worry about their lives at the price of death; neither did the tribe of Naphtali also on high places of the field.
07Jdg 5:19 "Kings came to fight, then battled the kings of Canaan at Taanach near the waters of Megiddo. They took no silver as the spoils of war.
07Jdg 5:20 The stars fought from heaven; they fought against Sisera from their orbits.
07Jdg 5:21 The current of the Kishon River swept them downstream, that ancient current, the Kishon's current! March on strongly, my soul!
07Jdg 5:22 Then loud was the beat of the horses' hooves - from the galloping, galloping war steeds!
07Jdg 5:23 "'Meroz is cursed!' declared the angel of the Lord. 'Utterly and totally cursed are its inhabitants, because they never came to the aid of the Lord, to the aid of the Lord against the valiant warriors!'"
07Jdg 5:24 "Blessed above all women is Jael, wife of Heber the Kenite; most blessed is she among women who live in tents!
07Jdg 5:25 Sisera asked for water - she gave him milk. In a magnificent bowl she brought him yogurt!
07Jdg 5:26 She reached out one hand for the tent peg, and her other for the workman's mallet. Then she struck Sisera, smashing his head, shattering and piercing his temple.
07Jdg 5:27 He crumpled to the ground between her feet, where he fell down and collapsed. Between her feet he crumpled, Fallen dead!
07Jdg 5:28 "Back at home, out the window Sisera's mother peered, lamenting through the lattice. 'Why is his chariot delayed in returning?'Why do the hoof beats of his chariots wait?'
07Jdg 5:29 Her wise attendants find an answer for her; in fact, she tells the same words to herself:
07Jdg 5:30 'They're busy finding and dividing the war booty, aren't they?A girl or two for each valiant warrior, and some dyed materials for Sisera - perhaps dyed, embroidered war booty - or some detailed embroidery for my neck as the booty of war!
07Jdg 5:31 "May all of your enemies perish like this, Lord! But may those who love him be like the ascending sun in its strength!" Then the land enjoyed quiet for 40 years.
07Jdg 6:1 Later on, the Israelites practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, so the Lord handed them over to the domination of Midian for seven years. 
07Jdg 6:2 Midian's control predominated throughout Israel, and because of Midian the Israelites went out to find temporary hiding places for themselves in the mountains, caves, and fortified places.
07Jdg 6:3 Whenever the Israelites sowed their crops, the Midianites, the Amalekites, and certain groups from the east would come up and invade them. 
07Jdg 6:4 They set up their military encampments to fight them, destroyed the harvest of the land as far as Gaza, and left nothing in Israel, whether harvested grain, sheep, oxen, or donkeys. 
07Jdg 6:5 They would invade with their livestock and tents, swooping in as numerous as locusts. It was impossible to count them or their camels - and they came into the land to destroy it. 
07Jdg 6:6 Because Israel was deeply impoverished due to the Midianites, they cried out to the Lord.
07Jdg 6:7 When the Israelites cried out to him about Midian, 
07Jdg 6:8 the Lord sent a man who was a prophet to the Israelites and said to them, "This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'I was the one who brought you up from the land of Egypt, delivering you from the house of servitude. 
07Jdg 6:9 I delivered you from the domination of Egypt and from the domination of all of your oppressors, expelling them right in front of you and giving their land to you. 
07Jdg 6:10 I told you, "I am the Lord your God. You are not to fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you'll be living."' But you haven't obeyed what I said."
07Jdg 6:11 After this, the angel of the Lord arrived and sat down in the shade of the oak tree in Ophrah that belonged to Joash the Abiezite while his son Gideon was threshing wheat in a wine press in order to safeguard it from the Midianites. 
07Jdg 6:12 The angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, "The Lord is with you, you valiant warrior!"
07Jdg 6:13 But Gideon replied, "Right¡¦ Sir, if the Lord is with us, then why has all of this happened to us?And where are all of his miraculous works that our ancestors recounted to us when they said, 'The Lord brought us up from Egypt, didn't he?' But now the Lord has abandoned us and given us over to Midian!"
07Jdg 6:14 The Lord looked straight at him and replied, "Go with this determination of yours and deliver Israel from Midian's domination. I've directed you, haven't I?"
07Jdg 6:15 "Right¡¦," Gideon responded. "Sir, how will I deliver Israel?Look - my family is the weakest in Manasseh, and I'm the youngest in my father's household."
07Jdg 6:16 The Lord said to him, "Because I'll be with you, and you'll defeat Midian - every single one of them!"
07Jdg 6:17 So Gideon asked him, "Please, if I have received favor from you, then do a miracle for me that shows that you're making this promise to me. 
07Jdg 6:18 And please don't leave here until I've come back to you, brought my offering, and set it down in front of you." The Lord replied, "I'll stay until you return."
07Jdg 6:19 Then Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. He put the meat in a basket and poured the broth into a pot, and brought them to the angel right under the oak tree. Then he made his offering. 
07Jdg 6:20 The angel, who was God, replied, "Take the meat and the unleavened bread and lay them on this boulder. Then pour out the broth." So he did that. 
07Jdg 6:21 The angel of the Lord extended the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and unleavened bread. Fire broke out from inside the boulder, consuming the meat and unleavened bread. Then the angel of the Lord vanished in front of him.
07Jdg 6:22 When Gideon realized that he had seen the angel of the Lord himself, he cried out, "Oh no! Lord God! I've been looking right at the angel of the Lord - and face-to-face at that!"
07Jdg 6:23 "Calm down! Don't be afraid." the Lord replied. "You're not going to die!" 
07Jdg 6:24 So Gideon built an altar right there to the Lord and called it "The Lord is peace." (To this very day it still stands in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.)
07Jdg 6:25 Later that very night, the Lord said to Gideon, "Take the bull that belongs to your father, along with a second bull that's seven years old. Then tear down the altar to Baal that your father owns, cut down the Asherah that's beside it, 
07Jdg 6:26 and build an altar to the Lord your God on top of this stronghold in an orderly manner. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering using the wood from the Asherah that you'll be cutting down."
07Jdg 6:27 So Gideon went with ten men who were his servants and did just what the Lord had told him to do, though he did it at night because he was too afraid of his father's family and the leading men of the city to do it during the day. 
07Jdg 6:28 When the leading men of the city got up early the next morning, the altar to Baal had been torn down, along with the Asherah that had stood beside it, and the second bull had been offered on the altar that had been erected.
07Jdg 6:29 They asked each other, "Who did this thing?" When they looked into it and asked around, they concluded, "Joash's son Gideon did it." 
07Jdg 6:30 So the leading men of the city ordered Joash, "Bring us that son of yours. He's going to die, because he tore down the altar to Baal and cut down the Asherah that stood beside it!"
07Jdg 6:31 But Joash responded to everyone who was opposing him, "Do you really intend to fight on Baal's behalf?Do you really intend to rescue him by ordering that whoever fights him will be executed by morning?If Baal is a god, let him fight for himself. After all, it was his altar that was torn down." 
07Jdg 6:32 So that very day he named Gideon Jerubbaal, that is, "Let Baal fight," since he had torn down his altar.
07Jdg 6:33 Then all the Midianites, Amalekites, and certain groups from the east gathered together, crossed the Jordan River, and set up camp in the Jezreel Valley. 
07Jdg 6:34 So the Spirit of the Lord took control of Gideon, who blew a trumpet, mustering the Abiezrites to follow him into battle. 
07Jdg 6:35 He sent messengers to the entire tribe of Manasseh, calling them to follow him, and he also sent word to the tribes of Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, calling them to meet him.34
07Jdg 6:36 Then Gideon told God, "If you intend to deliver Israel by my efforts as you've said, 
07Jdg 6:37 then take a look at this wool fleece that I'm placing on the threshing floor. If dew appears only on the fleece - and it's dry on the ground all around it - then I'll know that you'll deliver Israel by my efforts like you've said." 
07Jdg 6:38 That's exactly what happened£º When he got up early the next morning, he wrung out the fleece to drain the dew from it and extracted a bowl full of water.637
07Jdg 6:39 Then Gideon told God, "Don't let yourself be angry with me! I want to ask you once again£º please let me make a test with the fleece just once more. Cause it to be dry only on the fleece, but let there be dew all around on the ground." 
07Jdg 6:40 And God did it just like that later that night. It was dry only on the fleece, but dew was all around on the ground.
07Jdg 7:1 Then Jerubbaal, also known as Gideon, got up early along with all of his soldiers. They encamped near the Harod Spring. The Midian encampment lay in the valley to their north, near the hill of Moreh. 
07Jdg 7:2 The Lord told Gideon, "You have too many soldiers with you for me to drop Midian into their hands, because Israel would become arrogant and say, 'It was my own abilities that delivered me.' 
07Jdg 7:3 That's why you're to ask in full view of the soldiers, "Whoever is afraid or is trembling may go back from Mount Gilead and return home." So 22,000 soldiers left and 10,000 remained.
07Jdg 7:4 "There are still too many soldiers," the Lord said to Gideon. "Bring them down to the water and I'll refine them for you there. Therefore when I say to you, 'This one will be going with you,' he'll go with you, but no one may go about whom I tell you, 'This one won't be going with you.'"
07Jdg 7:5 So he brought his soldiers down to the water, and the Lord said to Gideon, "You are to cull out everyone who laps up water with his tongue like a dog from everyone who kneels to drink." 
07Jdg 7:6 The contingent of soldiers who lapped water with their hands to their mouths numbered 300 men, but everyone else kneeled to drink water.
07Jdg 7:7 Then the Lord told Gideon, "I'm going to deliver you with the 300 soldiers who lapped by giving the Midianites into your control. Send everyone else back to their own homes."
07Jdg 7:8 So the soldiers took provisions with them, along with their trumpets, and Gideon sent all the rest of the soldiers of Israel back to their own tents, but he retained the 300 men. And the Midian encampment was below him in the valley.
07Jdg 7:9 Later that same night, the Lord directed Gideon, "Get up and go down to the Midianite encampment, because I've given it into your control. 
07Jdg 7:10 But if you're afraid to go down there, you may take your servant Purah with you to their encampment, 
07Jdg 7:11 where you will hear what they're talking about. That way, you'll be encouraged to attack the encampment." So he and his servant Purah went down to the perimeter outposts of the encamped army.
07Jdg 7:12 The Midianites, the Amalekites, and certain groups from the east lay encamped in the valley, as thick as locusts. The number of their camels couldn't be calculated - they seemed as numerous as the sand on the seashore. 
07Jdg 7:13 Gideon arrived just as a soldier was talking to a friend about a dream. "Look!" he was saying. "I had a dream that went like this£º A loaf of barley bread rolled into the Midianite encampment, came to a tent, and collided with it. The loaf of bread fell down, turned upside down, and the tent collapsed!"
07Jdg 7:14 Then his friend replied, "Can this be anything else than the sword of Joash's son Gideon, that man from Israel?God must have given Midian and the entire encampment into his control!"
07Jdg 7:15 When Gideon heard the tale of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down in worship and then returned to the Israelite encampment. There he announced, "Get up! The Lord has given the Midianite army into your control!" 
07Jdg 7:16 Then he separated the 300 men into three companies, gave them each trumpets to carry, along with jars into which he placed lit torches.
07Jdg 7:17 He instructed them, "Watch me, and do what I do. When we come to the outer perimeter of the encampment, do what I do. 
07Jdg 7:18 When I sound my trumpet, accompanied by everyone who is with me, you must blow your trumpets all around the entire encampment. Then shout out, 'For the Lord and for Gideon!'"7
07Jdg 7:19 So Gideon and the 100 men with him arrived at the outer perimeter of the encampment at the beginning of the middle watch, just after they had posted sentries. They blew their trumpets and smashed the jars that they were carrying in their hands. 
07Jdg 7:20 When the three companies sounded their trumpets and broke the jars, they held the torches in their left hands and sounded their trumpets with their right hands. Then they cried out, "A sword for the Lord and for Gideon!" 
07Jdg 7:21 They stood up, each soldier in his assigned place surrounding the encampment, and the entire army ran away, sounding the alarm to retreat.7
07Jdg 7:22 As the 300 trumpets were being sounded, the Lord turned the swords of the Midianite soldiers against one another throughout the entire army, and the army ran away as far as Beth-shittah in the direction of Zererah. They got as far as the outskirts of Abel-meholah, near Tabbath. 
07Jdg 7:23 Israelite soldiers were called out from the territories of Naphtali, Asher, and throughout Manasseh, and they chased after the Midianites.
07Jdg 7:24 Gideon dispatched messengers throughout the mountainous region of Ephraim, notifying them, "Come down to fight Midian. Capture the water crossings as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan River before they can get to them." 
07Jdg 7:25 They captured two Midianite leaders, Oreb and Zeeb. While they were pursuing the Midianites, they executed Oreb at Oreb's Rock and Zeeb at Zeeb's Winepress, and then they carried the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from the east bank of the Jordan River.
07Jdg 8:1 Later on, the Ephraimites spoke to Gideon. They argued vehemently, "What are you doing to us?You never called us! But you went out to fight Midian!"
07Jdg 8:2 "What have I accomplished compared to you?" he responded. "Isn't what's left from Ephraim's harvest better than the best vintage of Abiezer?
07Jdg 8:3 God gave Oreb and Zeeb, the leaders of Midian, into your control. What was I able to do compared to you?" When he said this, their anger calmed down.
07Jdg 8:4 Meanwhile, Gideon and the 300 soldiers with him came to the Jordan, exhausted but continuing their pursuit. 
07Jdg 8:5 He said to the men of Succoth, "Please give loaves of bread to the soldiers who are following behind me. They're tired, and I'm pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian."
07Jdg 8:6 But the officials of Succoth replied, "Do you have Zebah and Zalmunna in custody already, so that we should give food to your army?"
07Jdg 8:7 So Gideon responded, "Okay then, but when the Lord has turned over Zebah and Zalmunna into my control, I'm going to whip you with thorns and briers from the desert!"
07Jdg 8:8 Then he left there to go to Penuel and asked the same thing from them, but the men of Penuel responded the same way the men of Succoth did. 
07Jdg 8:9 So he responded the same way to the men of Penuel, "When I come back safely, I'm going to tear down this tower."
07Jdg 8:10 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, along with their armies, about 15,000 men who survived from the entire army of the group from the east, since 120,000 swordsmen had already fallen. 
07Jdg 8:11 Gideon went up by a caravan route east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked their encampment when they were off guard. 
07Jdg 8:12 When Zebah and Zalmunna escaped, he pursued them, captured those two kings of Midian, and threw the entire army into a panic.
07Jdg 8:13 Then Joash's son Gideon returned from the battle along the Heres Ascent. 
07Jdg 8:14 He caught a young man from Succoth and interrogated him. He wrote out for Gideon a list of the 77 officials of Succoth, including its elders. 
07Jdg 8:15 Then Gideon approached the men of Succoth and announced, "Here are Zebah and Zalmunna. You criticized me about them when you said, 'Do you have Zebah and Zalmunna in custody already, so that we should give food to your weary army?'" 
07Jdg 8:16 So he took the elders of the city and disciplined the men of Succoth with thorns and briers from the desert. 
07Jdg 8:17 He also demolished the tower in Penuel and killed the men of the city.15
07Jdg 8:18 Afterwards, he asked Zebah and Zalmunna, "What were the men like whom you killed at Tabor?" They answered, "Like you, each one like the son of a king¡¦"
07Jdg 8:19 Gideon replied, "They were my brothers - sons from my own mother. As the Lord lives, if you had let them live, I wouldn't be killing you." 
07Jdg 8:20 Then he told his firstborn son Jether, "Get up and kill them!" But he was afraid, since he was still only a youngster.
07Jdg 8:21 Then Zebah and Zalmunna responded, "Get up and attack us yourself, since a man's valor is only as good as the man himself." So Gideon got up, killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the crescent-shaped necklaces that adorned the necks of their camels.
07Jdg 8:22 Then the men of Israel asked Gideon, "Rule over us - you, your son, and your grandsons - because you have delivered us from Midian's domination."
07Jdg 8:23 But Gideon told them, "I won't rule over you and my son won't rule over you. The Lord will rule you."
07Jdg 8:24 But Gideon also added, "I would like to ask that each of you give me a ring from his war booty" because, as Ishmaelites, the Midianites had been wearing gold rings.
07Jdg 8:25 They responded, "We'll be happy to give them." So they laid out a garment, and each of them contributed a ring from his war booty. 
07Jdg 8:26 The weight of the rings that he had asked for was 1,700 gold coins, not counting the crescent-shaped necklaces, pendants, and purple garments worn by the Midian kings, and also not counting the bands adorning the necks of their camels.25
07Jdg 8:27 Gideon crafted the booty into an ephod and enshrined it in his home town of Ophrah. Then all of Israel committed spiritual adultery with it there, and it became a snare for Gideon and his household.
07Jdg 8:28 Midian remained subjugated to the Israelites, and they didn't so much as raise their heads anymore, so the land was peaceful for 40 years during the lifetime of Gideon. 
07Jdg 8:29 Afterwards, Joash's son Jerubbaal went home and retired. 
07Jdg 8:30 Gideon raised 70 sons as his direct descendants, since he had many wives. 
07Jdg 8:31 His mistress in Shechem bore him a son whom he named Abimelech. 
07Jdg 8:32 Later, Joash's son Gideon died at a ripe old age and was buried in the tomb of his father Joash at Ophrah of the Abiezrites.831
07Jdg 8:33 Later on, as soon as Gideon was dead, the Israelites again committed spiritual adultery with the Baals, and appointed Baal-berith to be their god. 
07Jdg 8:34 The Israelites did not remember the Lord their God, who continually delivered them from the domination of their enemies who surrounded them on every side. 
07Jdg 8:35 And they showed no gracious love to the household of Jerubbaal - also known as Gideon - despite all the good that he had done for Israel.
07Jdg 9:1 Then Jerubbaal's son Abimelech went to his mother's relatives in Shechem. He spoke to the entire family of his mother's father, telling them, "Ask all the "lords" of Shechem, 'What's better for you?That 70 men, each of them Jerubbaal's sons, rule over you?Or that one man rule over you?' Keep in mind that I'm like your own close relative."
07Jdg 9:3 So his mother's relatives spoke all of this on his behalf in the presence of all the "lords" of Shechem. Since they were inclined to follow Abimelech, they said, "He's our relative!" 
07Jdg 9:4 and they gave him 70 silver coins from the temple that they had built to Baal-berith. Abimelech hired some worthless and useless men, who followed him 
07Jdg 9:5 to his father's house in Ophrah. There he murdered his own brothers, Jerubbaal's sons - all 70 of them - in one place. But Jerubbaal's youngest son Jotham survived by hiding himself.
07Jdg 9:6 All the men from Shechem and Beth-millo gathered together and set up Abimelech as king near the pillar erected in Shechem. 
07Jdg 9:7 When Jotham was informed about this, he went out, took his stand on top of Mount Gerizim, and cried out loudly, "Listen to me, you "lords" of Shechem, and God will listen to you.
07Jdg 9:8 "Once upon a time the trees went out to consecrate a king for themselves. "So they said to the olive tree, 'Reign over us!'
07Jdg 9:9 But the olive tree asked them, 'Should I stop producing my rich oils by which both God and men are honored and go take dominion over trees?'
07Jdg 9:10 "So the trees said to the fig tree, 'Hey you! Come and reign over us!'
07Jdg 9:11 But the fig tree asked them, 'Should I leave my sweet, good fruit and go take dominion over trees?'
07Jdg 9:12 "So the trees said to the grape vine, 'Hey you! Come and reign over us!'
07Jdg 9:13 But the grape vine asked them, 'Should I leave my new wine, which cheers God and man, and go take dominion over trees?'
07Jdg 9:14 "So all the trees said to the bramble bush, 'Hey you! Come and reign over us!'
07Jdg 9:15 Then the bramble bush replied to the trees, 'If you really are consecrating me to rule you, come and put your confidence in my shade; but if not, may fire spring out from the bramble bush and burn up the cedars of Lebanon¡¦'
07Jdg 9:16 "Now then, if you have been acting in good faith and integrity by making a king out of Abimelech, if you have treated Jerubbaal and his household appropriately by acting toward him as he deserved?
07Jdg 9:17 because my father fought on your behalf, throwing away all concern for his own life, and delivered you from Midian's domination. 
07Jdg 9:18 "But now as for you, you've rebelled against my father's house today. You've murdered his sons - 70 men - in one place, and you've installed Abimelech, the son of his mistress, as king to rule over the "lords" of Shechem, since he's related to you. 
07Jdg 9:19 So if you've acted in good faith and integrity toward Jerubbaal and his household today, then you're welcome to Abimelech, and he's welcome to you¡¦ 
07Jdg 9:20 But if not, may fire spring out from Abimelech and consume the "lords" of Shechem and Beth-millo, and may fire spring out from the "lords" of Shechem and Beth-millo to consume Abimelech." 
07Jdg 9:21 Then Jotham escaped by running away. He went to Beer and remained there because of his brother Abimelech.18
07Jdg 9:22 Abimelech dominated Israel for three years. 
07Jdg 9:23 Then God sent an evil spirit to divide Abimelech and the "lords" of Shechem 
07Jdg 9:24 so that the violence committed against the 70 sons of Jerubbaal might come back on their brother Abimelech, who murdered them, and so it might come back on the "lords" of Shechem, who provoked him to murder his brothers. 
07Jdg 9:25 The "lords" of Shechem sent out men to ambush him on the mountain tops, and they robbed everyone who came by them along the roads, and this was reported to Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:26 Meanwhile, Ebed's son Gaal arrived with his relatives and crossed over into Shechem. The "lords" of Shechem put their faith in him. 
07Jdg 9:27 They went out into the fields, harvested their vineyards, made some wine, and threw a party. Then they went into the temple of their god, ate, drank, and cursed Abimelech.
07Jdg 9:28 Then Ebed's son Gaal remarked, "Who is this Abimelech?And who is Shechem?Should we serve him?Isn't he Jerubbaal's son?Isn't Zebul his lieutenant?Serve the men of Hamor, Shechem's ancestor - but why are we serving him?
07Jdg 9:29 If only authority over this people were given to me. Then I would remove Abimelech!" Then he challenged Abimelech£º "Build up your army and then come out and fight!"
07Jdg 9:30 When Zebul, the ruler of the city, heard what Ebed's son Gaal had said, he flew into a rage. 
07Jdg 9:31 He sent messengers to Abimelech in secret and told him, "Look out! Ebed's son Gaal and his family have arrived here in Shechem. Watch out! They're stirring up the city against you. 
07Jdg 9:32 So get up at night, take your soldiers with you, and wait in ambush out in the field. 
07Jdg 9:33 Tomorrow morning when the sun is up, get up early and attack the city. When Gaal and his army come out to fight you, do whatever you can to them."
07Jdg 9:34 So Abimelech and his entire army got up that night and waited in ambush against Shechem in four separate companies.
07Jdg 9:35 Ebed's son Gaal went out and stood in the entrance to the city gate while Abimelech and his army were creeping out of their ambush. 
07Jdg 9:36 When Gaal saw the army, he observed to Zebul, "Look there! People are coming down from the top of the mountains." But Zebul replied to him, "You're looking at morning shadows cast by the mountains. They just look like men to you."
07Jdg 9:37 Gaal spoke up again to say, "Look! People are coming down from the highest part of the land, and there's a company approaching from the diviner's oak tree."
07Jdg 9:38 So Zebul replied, "Right... So where's your boasting now?You said, 'Who is Abimelech?Should we serve him?' Isn't this the army that you insulted?So go out right now and fight them!"
07Jdg 9:39 So Gaal went out in full view of the "lords" of Shechem and fought Abimelech. 
07Jdg 9:40 Abimelech chased him, and Gaal ran away from him. Many fell wounded right up to the entrance to the city gate. 
07Jdg 9:41 Afterwards, Abimelech remained at Arumah, but Zebul expelled Gaal and his family so they couldn't remain in Shechem.
07Jdg 9:42 The next day, the people went out to the field, and Abimelech learned about it. 
07Jdg 9:43 So he took his army, divided it into three separate companies, and laid in ambush out in the field. When Abimelech noticed the people coming out from the city, his army attacked them and killed them. 
07Jdg 9:44 Then Abimelech and the soldiers who were with him rushed forward and commandeered the entrance to the city gate while the other two companies ran out to kill everyone who was in the field. 
07Jdg 9:45 Abimelech fought against the city all that day, captured the city, killed the people in it, then tore the city to the ground and sowed it with salt.
07Jdg 9:46 When all the "lords" at the tower of Shechem heard what had happened, they retreated into the inner chamber of the temple of El-berith. 
07Jdg 9:47 Abimilech was told that all of the "lords" of the Shechem Tower had assembled there. 
07Jdg 9:48 So he went up to Mount Zalmon, accompanied by his entire army. Abimelech had an axe in his hand, so he cut down a branch from a tree, lifted it up, and laid it on his shoulder. Then he told the army that had accompanied him, "You've seen what I just did. Hurry up! Do the same thing!"947
07Jdg 9:49 Then his entire army also cut down a branch for each soldier, followed Abimelech to the inner chamber, and set fire to it on fire while they were inside. As a result, all the men of the tower of Shechem died, including about a thousand men and women.
07Jdg 9:50 Later on, Abimelech went to Thebez, set up a siege encampment there, and captured it. 
07Jdg 9:51 But there was a fortified tower in the center of the city, and all the men, women, and leaders of the city escaped to it, shut themselves in, and went up to the roof of the tower. 
07Jdg 9:52 So Abimelech approached the tower, attacked it, and approached the tower's gate, intending to burn it down. 
07Jdg 9:53 But a certain woman threw an upper milestone down on Abimelech's head, fracturing his skull.51
07Jdg 9:54 So he cried out to his young armor bearer and ordered him, "Draw your sword and kill me, so no one will say about me that 'A woman killed him.'" So the young man pierced him through, and he died. 
07Jdg 9:55 When the men of Israel noticed that Abimelech was dead, they each left for home. 
07Jdg 9:56 That's how God repaid Abimelech for the evil thing he did to his father by killing his 70 brothers. 
07Jdg 9:57 God also repaid the men of Shechem for their wickedness, and the curse of Jerubbaal's son Jotham came true for them.954
07Jdg 10:1 A man from the tribe of Issachar, Puah's son Tola, grandson of Dodo, arose to save Israel. He lived in Shamir, in the mountainous region of Ephraim. 
07Jdg 10:2 He governed Israel for 23 years and then died. He was buried in Shamir.
07Jdg 10:3 After him, Jair the Gileadite arose and governed Israel for 22 years. 
07Jdg 10:4 His 30 sons rode on 30 donkeys, controlling 30 cities in the territory of Gilead named Havvoth-jair to this day. 
07Jdg 10:5 Jair died and was buried in Kamon.
07Jdg 10:6 Later on, the Israelites again practiced what the Lord considered to be evil by serving the Baals, the stars, the gods of Aram, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the descendants of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines. In doing so, they ignored the Lord and wouldn't serve him. 
07Jdg 10:7 In his burning anger against Israel, he sold them into domination by the Philistines and the Ammonites, 
07Jdg 10:8 who trampled and troubled the Israelites during that year - eighteen years for the Israelites who lived east of the Jordan River in Gilead, the land occupied by the Amorites. 
07Jdg 10:9 The Ammonites crossed the Jordan River to fight against the tribes of Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim. As a result, Israel was deeply distressed.
07Jdg 10:10 Then the Israelites cried out to the Lord and told him, "We have sinned against you because we have abandoned our God to serve the Baals."
07Jdg 10:11 The Lord replied to the Israelites, "Aren't you away from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, and the Philistines?
07Jdg 10:12 And when the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites harassed you, you cried out to me, and I delivered you from under their domination. 
07Jdg 10:13 But you have abandoned me and served other gods. Therefore I will no longer be delivering you. 
07Jdg 10:14 Go and cry out to the gods that you have chosen for yourselves. Let them deliver you in your time of trouble."
07Jdg 10:15 The Israelites replied to the Lord, "We have sinned, so do to us anything that's right to do in your opinion, just please deliver us right now." 
07Jdg 10:16 When they put away their foreign gods and served the Lord, he brought Israel's misery to an end. 
07Jdg 10:17 The Ammonites were summoned and they encamped in Gilead. The Israelites assembled together and encamped in Mizpah. 
07Jdg 10:18 The people and Gilead's officials inquired among themselves, "Who will begin our attack against the Ammonites?He'll become head over everyone who lives in Gilead."
07Jdg 11:1 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a valiant soldier, but he was also the son of a prostitute and Jephthah's father Gilead. 
07Jdg 11:2 Gilead's wife bore two sons through him, but when his wife's sons grew up, they expelled Jephthah and declared to him, "You won't have an inheritance in this house, since you're the son of a different woman." 
07Jdg 11:3 So Jephthah escaped from his brothers and lived in the territory of Tob, where worthless men gathered themselves around him and went out on raiding parties with him.
07Jdg 11:4 Later on, the Ammonites attacked Israel. 
07Jdg 11:5 When this happened, the elders of Gilead went to the territory of Tob to find Jephthah. 
07Jdg 11:6 They told him, "Come and be our commander so we can fight the Ammonites!"
07Jdg 11:7 But Jephthah replied to the elders of Gilead, "Weren't you the ones who hated me and drove me out of my father's house?And you come to me now that you're in trouble?"
07Jdg 11:8 So the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, "Well, we're coming back to you now so you can accompany us, fight the Ammonites, and become the head of all the inhabitants of Gilead."
07Jdg 11:9 Then Jephthah asked the elders of Gilead, "If you all return me to fight against the Ammonites and the Lord hands them over right in front of me, will I really become your head?"
07Jdg 11:10 The elders of Gilead responded to Jephthah, "May the Lord serve as a witness that we're making this agreement between ourselves to do as we've said." 
07Jdg 11:11 So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people appointed him head and military commander over them. Jephthah uttered everything he had to say with the solemnity of an oath in the Lord's presence at Mizpah.
07Jdg 11:12 Afterwards, Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites to ask him, "What's your dispute between us that prompted you to come and attack my land?"
07Jdg 11:13 The king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah, "We're here because Israel took away my land from the Arnon River as far as the Jabbok River and as far as the Jordan River when they came up from Egypt! So restore it as a gesture of good will."
07Jdg 11:14 But Jephthah sent additional messengers again to the king of the Ammonites 
07Jdg 11:15 and they informed him, "This is Jephthah's response£º 'Israel didn't seize the land of Moab nor the land of the Ammonites. 
07Jdg 11:16 Here's what happened£º When Israel came up from Egypt, passed through the desert to the Red Sea, and arrived at Kadesh, 
07Jdg 11:17 Israel sent a delegation to the king of Edom and asked him, "Please let us pass through your territory." 'But the king of Edom wouldn't listen. So they also sent word to the king of Moab, but he wouldn't consent, either. So Israel stayed at Kadesh. 
07Jdg 11:18 Then they went through the desert, circumventing the territory belonging to Edom and Moab. They encamped on the other side of the Arnon River, but never entered the territory of Moab because the Arnon River is the border of Moab.
07Jdg 11:19 'Then Israel sent a delegation to Sihon, king of the Amorites and king of Heshbon. Israel requested of him, "Please let us pass through your territory to our place." 
07Jdg 11:20 But Sihon didn't trust Israel to pass through his territory, so he assembled his entire army, encamped in Jahaz, and fought against Israel.
07Jdg 11:21 'The Lord God of Israel handed Sihon and his entire army into the control of Israel, and defeated them. As a result, Israel took control over the entire land of the Amorites, who were living in that country. 
07Jdg 11:22 They took possession of the entire territory of the Amorites from the Arnon River as far as the Jabbok River and from the desert as far as the Jordan River.
07Jdg 11:23 'Now then, since the Lord God of Israel expelled the Amorites right in front of his people Israel, are you going to control their territory?
07Jdg 11:24 Don't you control what your god Chemosh gives you?In the same way, we'll take control of whomever the Lord our God has driven out in front of us. 
07Jdg 11:25 Also ask yourselves£º do you have a better case than Zippor's son Balak, king of Moab?Did he ever have a quarrel with Israel or ever win a fight against them?
07Jdg 11:26 When Israel was living in Heshbon and its surrounding villages, in Aroer and its surrounding villages, and in all the cities that line the banks of the Arnon River these past three hundred years, why didn't you retake them during that time - 23
07Jdg 11:27 'I haven't sinned against you, but you are acting wrongly against me by declaring war on me. May the Lord, the Judge, sit in judgment today between the Israelites and the Ammonites.'
07Jdg 11:28 But the king of the Ammonites wouldn't heed the message that Jephthah had sent to him.
07Jdg 11:29 The Spirit of the Lord came on Jephthah, so he swept through Gilead and the territory of Manasseh, then swept through Mizpah in Gilead, and from Mizpah in Gilead he proceeded toward where the Ammonites were encamped. 
07Jdg 11:30 Jephthah made this solemn vow to the Lord£º "If you truly give the Ammonites into my control, 
07Jdg 11:31 then if I return from the Ammonites without incident, whatever comes out the doors of my house to meet me shall become the Lord's, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering."
07Jdg 11:32 Then Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites and attacked them. The Lord gave them into his control. 
07Jdg 11:33 He attacked them from Aroer to the entrance of Minnith - twenty cities in all - even as far as Abel-keramim. As a result, the Ammonites were subdued right in front of the Israelites. 
07Jdg 11:34 When Jephthah arrived at his home in Mizpah - surprise! - it was his daughter who came out to meet him, playing tambourines and dancing. She was his one and only child. Except for her, he had no other son or daughter.
07Jdg 11:35 When he saw her, he ripped his clothes and cried out, "Oh no! My daughter! You have terribly burdened me! You've joined those who are causing me trouble, because I've given my word to the Lord, and I cannot go back on it.
07Jdg 11:36 She said to him, "My father, you have given your word to the Lord. Do to me according to what has come out of your own mouth, considering that the Lord has paid back your enemies, the Ammonites." 
07Jdg 11:37 Then she continued talking with her father, "Do this for me£º leave me alone by myself for two months. I'll go up to the mountains and cry there because I'll never marry. My friends and I will go."11
07Jdg 11:38 So he said, "Go!" He sent her away for two months. She left with her friends and cried there on the mountains because she would never marry. 
07Jdg 11:39 Later, after the two months were concluded, she returned to her father, and he fulfilled what he had solemnly vowed - and she never married. That's how the custom arose in Israel 
07Jdg 11:40 that for four days out of every year the Israelite women would go to mourn the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite in commemoration.
07Jdg 12:1 A little while later, the army of Ephraim was mustered, and they crossed to Zaphon. They confronted Jephthah and asked, "Why did you cross over to fight the Ammonites without calling us to accompany you?We're going to burn your house down around you!"
07Jdg 12:2 But Jephthah replied to them, "My army and I were engaged in a serious fight with the Ammonites. I called for you, but you didn't deliver me from their control. 
07Jdg 12:3 When I saw that you wouldn't be delivering me, I took my own life in my hands, crossed over to fight the Ammonites, and the Lord gave them into my control. So why have you come here today to fight me?" 
07Jdg 12:4 Then Jephthah mustered all the men of Gilead, fought the tribe of Ephraim, and defeated them, because they had been claiming, "You Gileadites are fugitives in the midst of the tribes of Ephraim and Manasseh."3
07Jdg 12:5 The Gileadites seized control of the Jordan River's fords along the border of Ephraim's territory. Later on, when any fugitive from Ephraim asked them, "Let me cross over," the men from Gilead would ask him, "Are you an Ephraimite?" If he said "No," 
07Jdg 12:6 they would order him, "Pronounce the word 'Shibboleth' right now." If he said "Sibboleth," not being able to pronounce it correctly, they would seize him and slaughter him there at the fords of the Jordan River. During those days 42,000 Ephraimites died that way.
07Jdg 12:7 Jephthah governed Israel for six years. Then Jephthah died and was buried somewhere in the cities of Gilead.
07Jdg 12:8 After he died, Ibzan from Bethlehem governed Israel for ten years. 
07Jdg 12:9 He had 30 sons and 30 daughters, but he gave his daughters in marriage to outsiders and brought in 30 outsiders for his sons. He governed Israel for seven years, 
07Jdg 12:10 then he died and was buried in Bethlehem.129
07Jdg 12:11 Elon the Zebulunite governed Israel after him for ten years. 
07Jdg 12:12 Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried in Aijalon within the territory of Zebulun.
07Jdg 12:13 Hillel the Pirathonite's son Abdon governed Israel after him. 
07Jdg 12:14 He had 40 sons and 30 grandsons who rode on 70 donkeys. He governed Israel for eight years. 
07Jdg 12:15 Then he died and was buried at Pirathon in the territory of Ephraim, in the mountainous region of the Amalekites.
07Jdg 13:1 Some time later, the Israelites again practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, so the Lord handed them over into the domination of the Philistines for 40 years. 
07Jdg 13:2 There was one man from Zorah, from the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. Since his wife was infertile, she hadn't borne children.
07Jdg 13:3 One day the angel of the presentedhimselftothewoman."Hello!"hegreeted her. "Though you are infertile at this time and haven't borne a child, you're about to conceive and give birth to a son. 
07Jdg 13:4 So be sure that you don't drink wine or anything intoxicating, and don't eat anything unclean 
07Jdg 13:5 because - surprise!  - you're going to conceive and give birth to a son! Don't put a razor to his head, because the young man will be a Nazarite, dedicated to God from inside the womb. He will begin to deliver Israel from domination by the Philistines."
07Jdg 13:6 Then the woman went to tell her husband. She said, "A man of God appeared to me. He looked like what an angel of God would look like - very frightening. I didn't ask him where he had come from and he didn't tell me his name. 
07Jdg 13:7 He told me, 'Surprise! - you're going to conceive and give birth to a son!' and as for you, 'Be sure that you don't drink wine or anything intoxicating, and don't eat anything unclean,' 'because the young man will be a Nazarite dedicated to God from inside the womb' until the day he dies."
07Jdg 13:8 So Manoah prayed to the Lord, "Please, Lord, have the man of God whom you sent before come again so he can instruct us what to do on behalf of the child who is to be born."
07Jdg 13:9 God listened to Manoah's request, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she was sitting out in the pasture. But her husband Manoah wasn't with her, 
07Jdg 13:10 so the woman ran quickly to tell her husband, "Look! The man who came the other day appeared to me!"
07Jdg 13:11 So Manoah got up quickly and followed his wife, and when he came to the man he said to him, "Are you the man who spoke to my wife?" He replied, "I am the same one."
07Jdg 13:12 Manoah asked, "Now, when what you've said occurs, what is to be the young man's way of life and work?"
07Jdg 13:13 The angel of the Lord replied to Manoah, "Just have your wife be careful to carry out everything that I told her. 
07Jdg 13:14 She must not consume anything extracted from grape vines, including wine or anything intoxicating, and she must not eat anything unclean, doing everything that I commissioned her to do."
07Jdg 13:15 Manoah responded to the angel of the Lord, "Please, let us detain you while we prepare a young goat for you."
07Jdg 13:16 The angel of the Lord answered Manoah, "If you detain me, I won't be eating your food, but if you prepare a burnt offering, you'll be making a sacrifice to the Lord." The angel of the Lord said this because Manoah didn't know that he was the angel of the Lord.
07Jdg 13:17 Manoah asked the angel of the Lord, "What's your name, because when what you've said happens, we'll glorify you?"
07Jdg 13:18 The angel of the Lord answered him, "Why are you asking this about my name?It's 'Wonderful.'"13
07Jdg 13:19 So Manoah prepared a young goat and a grain offering and offered it on a boulder to the Lord, who kept on performing miracles while Manoah and his wife watched continuously. 
07Jdg 13:20 When the burnt offering was engulfed in flames that sprang up from the altar toward heaven, the angel of the Lord ascended in the flame that came from the altar. When Manoah and his wife observed this, they collapsed on their faces to the ground. 
07Jdg 13:21 The angel of the Lord did not appear again to Manoah or to his wife, and then Manoah knew confidently that the visitor had been the angel of the Lord.
07Jdg 13:22 Then Manoah said to his wife, "We're going to die for sure, because we've seen God!"
07Jdg 13:23 But his wife replied to him, "If the Lord had intended to kill us, he wouldn't have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering from us, he wouldn't have shown us all these things, and he wouldn't have permitted us to hear things like this, now would he?"
07Jdg 13:24 Later on, the woman gave birth to a son and named him Samson. The child grew strong and the Lord blessed him. 25Then the Spirit of the Lord began to rouse him where the tribe of Dan was encamped, between Zorah and Eshtaol.
07Jdg 14:1 A while later, Samson went down to Timnah and observed a woman in Timnah who was of Philistine origin. 
07Jdg 14:2 Then he returned and said to his father and mother, "In Timnah I saw a woman of Philistine origin." He ordered them, "Get her for me as a wife. Now!"
07Jdg 14:3 His father and mother asked him, "Isn't there a woman suitable among the daughters of your relatives or among all of our people, since you're going to get your wife from the uncircumcised Philistines?" But Samson retorted to his father, "Get her for me, since she looks fine to me." 
07Jdg 14:4 Meanwhile, his father and mother did not know that she was from the Lord, because he had been seeking a favorable opportunity concerning the Philistines, since the Philistines were dominating Israel at that time.
07Jdg 14:5 Then Samson went down in the direction of Timnah with his father and mother and arrived as far as the vineyards of Timnah. And - surprise! - a young lion came roaring at him! 
07Jdg 14:6 The Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and he ripped the lion apart as one might dissect a young goat, even though he carried nothing in his hand. But he didn't tell his father and mother what he had done.
07Jdg 14:7 Then he went down and talked to the woman, and she looked fine to Samson. 
07Jdg 14:8 When he came back later to marry her, he turned aside to observe the lion's carcass. Amazingly, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, complete with honey. 
07Jdg 14:9 So he scraped some out into his hands and went on his way, eating all the while. When he met his father and mother, he gave some to them, and they ate it, too. But he didn't inform them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion.
07Jdg 14:10 Later on, when his father went down to visit the woman, Samson threw a party there, since young men customarily did this. 
07Jdg 14:11 When they saw him, they brought 30 companions to accompany him. 
07Jdg 14:12 "Let me tell you a riddle," Samson said to them. "If you can solve it during this week-long feast, I'll give you 30 linen garments and 30 formal garments. 
07Jdg 14:13 But if you don't solve it, then you'll give me 30 linen garments and 30 formal garments." "Tell us your riddle and we'll solve it," they responded.
07Jdg 14:14 So he said to them£º From the eater came something edible; from the strong something sweet. For three days they couldn't solve the riddle.
07Jdg 14:15 The next day, they told Samson's wife, "Coax your husband to explain the riddle or we'll set fire to your father's house - with you in it! You've invited us here to make us paupers, haven't you?"
07Jdg 14:16 So Samson's wife cried in front of him and accused him, "You only hate me. You don't love me. You've told a riddle to my relatives, but you haven't told the solution to me." Samson responded, "Look, I haven't told my parents, either. Why should I tell you?"
07Jdg 14:17 So she kept on crying in front of him for the entire seven days of the wedding party. On the seventh day he told the solution to her because she nagged him, and then she told the solution to the riddle to her relatives.
07Jdg 14:18 Then the men of the city answered him just before sunset on the seventh day£º "What's sweeter than honey?What's stronger than lions?" Samson responded, "If you hadn't plowed with my heifer you wouldn't have solved my riddle."
07Jdg 14:19 Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon, killed 30 men, took their belongings, and gave the garments to those who had told him the solution to the riddle. He remained furious, left for his father's house, 
07Jdg 14:20 and Samson's wife went to the best man at his wedding.
07Jdg 15:1 A while later during the wheat harvest, Samson visited his wife, bringing along a young goat, and said to his father-in-law, "I'm going into my wife's room." But her father wouldn't give permission for him to go.
07Jdg 15:2 Her father said, "Because I honestly thought that you hated her deeply, I gave her in marriage to your best man. Isn't her younger sister better than she?Please then, let her be yours instead."
07Jdg 15:3 Samson replied to them, "This time I'll be blameless when I do something evil to the Philistines." 
07Jdg 15:4 So Samson went out, caught 300 foxes, grabbed some torches, tied the foxes together in pairs at their tails, and fastened a torch between each pair of tails. 
07Jdg 15:5 Then he ignited the torches, set the foxes loose into the Philistines' unharvested grain, and burned up both the harvested shocks and the standing grain, along with their vineyards and olive groves.4
07Jdg 15:6 Then the Philistines demanded, "Who did this?"
07Jdg 15:7 Someone said, "Samson, son-in-law of the Timnite, because his father-in-law took Samson's wife and gave her to the best man at Samson's wedding." In retaliation, the Philistines came up and burned her and her father to death. Samson replied to them, "Because you did this, I'm not going to stop until I get my revenge against you!" 
07Jdg 15:8 So he attacked them ruthlessly in a massive slaughter, then left to live in the caves of Etam. 
07Jdg 15:9 In response, the Philistines went up, encamped in the territory of Judah, and raided Lehi.
07Jdg 15:10 The leading men of Judah asked, "Why have you invaded us?" They replied, "We're here to arrest Samson. Then we're going to do to him what he did to us."
07Jdg 15:11 In response, 3,000 soldiers from the tribe of Judah went down to the caves of the rock of Etam and asked Samson, "Don't you know that the Philistines have us in their control?What have you done to us?" "I did to them what they did to me," he answered.
07Jdg 15:12 They responded, "We've come here to arrest you and transfer you to the custody of the Philistines." Samson told them, "Promise me that you won't kill me."
07Jdg 15:13 So they said, "No, we won't. But we're going to tie you up securely and transfer you to their custody. But we won't kill you." Then they bound him with two ropes and brought him up from the caves.
07Jdg 15:14 When Samson arrived at Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, so that the ropes that bound him were like flax that's been burned by fire, and his bonds dissolved. 
07Jdg 15:15 He happened upon a jawbone from a putrefying donkey, reached out to grab it, and killed 1,000 men with it. 
07Jdg 15:16 Then Samson declared, "With a jawbone from the donkey - here a heap, there a pair of heaps - with the jawbone of the donkey I've killed 1,000 men." 
07Jdg 15:17 When he finally finished bragging, he discarded the jawbone and named that place "Jawbone Heights."
07Jdg 15:18 Aferward, he became thirsty, called out to the Lord, and told him, "So, you provided this great deliverance at the hands of your servant, but now I'm to die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised?" 
07Jdg 15:19 So God split a hollow place that's in Lehi, and water sprang out of it. After he had taken a drink, his strength returned, and he revived. That's why it was named "En-hakakore," which is in Lehi to this day. 20Samson governed Israel for twenty years during the Philistine domination. 15
07Jdg 16:1 Sometime later, Samson went to Gaza, saw a prostitute there, and went in to have sex with her. 
07Jdg 16:2 When the Gazites were informed, "Samson has come here!" they surrounded him, intending to lay in wait for him at the city gate throughout the entire night. They kept quiet all night, telling each other, "At first light, let's kill him!"
07Jdg 16:3 Meanwhile, Samson had sex until midnight, then at midnight he got up, grabbed the doors, the two door posts, and the bars of the city gate, and uprooted them. He put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the mountain opposite Hebron.
07Jdg 16:4 After this incident, he loved a woman in Sorek Valley whose name was Delilah. 
07Jdg 16:5 The Philistine officials approached her and told her, "Entice him to discover where his great strength is, and how we can overpower him. We intend to tie him up and torture him. We'll each pay you 1,100 silver coins."
07Jdg 16:6 So Delilah asked Samson, "Please tell me the secret to your great strength and how you may be tied up and tortured."
07Jdg 16:7 Samson replied, "If I'm tied up with seven green cords that have never been dried out, then I'll become weak and just like any other human being."
07Jdg 16:8 Then the Philistine leaders brought her seven green cords that had never been dried, and she tied him up with them. 
07Jdg 16:9 Meanwhile, some kidnappers were hiding inside an inner room, waiting for her signal. So she told him, "The Philistines are attacking you!" But he snapped the cords as one might break a burned candle wick. So his secret remained undiscovered.
07Jdg 16:10 Some time later, Delilah told Samson, "Look here! You've been mocking me and lying to me. Now please tell me how you can be tied up."
07Jdg 16:11 He told her, "If I'm tied up securely with new ropes that have never been used, then I'll become weak and just like any other human being."
07Jdg 16:12 So Delilah grabbed some new ropes and tied him up. Then she told him, "The Philistines are attacking you, Samson!" because some kidnappers were hiding inside an inner room. But he snapped the ropes from his arms like thread.
07Jdg 16:13 Later on, Delilah said to Samson, "You're still been mocking me and telling me lies! Tell me how to tie you up!" He answered her, "If you weave the seven locks of my hair into a loom and fasten it with a peg, then I will become weak and just like any other human being."
07Jdg 16:14 So Delilah took the seven locks of his hair and wove them into the loom while he slept. She fastened his hair with a peg and then said to him, "The Philistines are attacking you, Samson!" But he woke up from his nap and pulled the pin from the loom and the weaving.
07Jdg 16:15 Some time later, she asked him, "How can you keep saying 'I love you!' when your heart isn't with me?These three times you've lied to me and haven't told me where your great strength lies." 
07Jdg 16:16 She nagged him every day with this speech, pestering him until he was annoyed nearly to death.
07Jdg 16:17 So he finally disclosed everything. He told her, "A razor has never touched my head, because I've been a Nazarite for God before I was born. If I am shaved, then my strength will abandon me and I will become weak like every human being."
07Jdg 16:18 When Delilah realized that he had disclosed everything to her, she sent for the Philistine officials and told them, "Hurry up and come here at once, because he has told me everything." So the Philistine officials went to her and brought their money with them. 
07Jdg 16:19 So she enticed him to fall asleep on her lap, called for a man to shave off his seven locks of hair from his head, and so began to humiliate him. Then his strength abandoned him.18
07Jdg 16:20 When she cried out, "The Philistines are attacking you, Samson!" he woke from his sleep and said to himself, "I'll go out like I did at other times like this and shake myself free." But he didn't know that the Lord had abandoned him.
07Jdg 16:21 Then the Philistines grabbed him, gouged out his eyes, brought him down to Gaza, tied him up in bronze chains, and made him grind grain in their prison. 
07Jdg 16:22 But the hair on his head began to grow again after it had been shaved off.
07Jdg 16:23 Some time later, the Philistine officials got together to present a magnificent sacrifice to their god Dagon, and to throw a party, because they were claiming, "Our god has given Samson into our control!"
07Jdg 16:24 When the people saw Samson, they praised their god, claiming£º Our god has given our enemy into our control; the one who was destroying our land, and who has killed many of us.
07Jdg 16:25 Because they all got good and drunk, they ordered, "Go get Samson, so he can entertain us." So they called for Samson from the prison, and he entertained them while they made him stand between the pillars.
07Jdg 16:26 Then Samson said to the young man who had been leading him around by the hand, "Let me touch and feel the pillars on which this building rests, and I'll support myself against them." 
07Jdg 16:27 Now the building was full of men, women, and all the Philistine officials, with about 3,000 men and women on the roof watching Samson while he was entertaining them.1626
07Jdg 16:28 Then Samson cried out to the Lord, "Lord God, please remember me. And please strengthen me this one time, God, so that I can repay the Philistines right now for my two eyes." 
07Jdg 16:29 Then Samson grabbed the two middle pillars upon which the house rested and braced himself against them with one pillar in his right hand and the other in his left.
07Jdg 16:30 Then Samson said, "Let me die with the Philistines!" He strained with all his strength until the building collapsed on the officials and every person in it. As a result, the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he killed during his lifetime. Afterwards, his brothers and his father's household servants came down, took him, brought him back, and buried him in his father Manoah's tomb between Zorah and Eshtaol. He had governed Israel for 20 years.
07Jdg 17:1 A man named Micah lived in the mountainous region of the territory of Ephraim. 
07Jdg 17:2 He told his mother, "Do you remember those 1,100 silver coins that were stolen from you and about which you uttered a curse when I could hear it?Well, I have the silver. I took it." So she replied, "May my son be blessed by the Lord."
07Jdg 17:3 Her son gave back the 1,100 silver coins to his mother, and she said, "I'm totally giving this silver - from my hand to the Lord - so my son can make a carved image and a cast image. So I'm returning it to you."
07Jdg 17:4 When he had returned the silver to his mother, his mother took 200 of the silver coins and handed them over to a silversmith. He crafted them into a carved image and into a cast image, and they were set up in Micah's house. 
07Jdg 17:5 This man Micah had his own shrine, had crafted his own ephod and some household idols, and had installed one of his sons as a priest.
07Jdg 17:6 Back in those days, Israel didn't yet have a king, so each person did whatever seemed right in his own opinion.
07Jdg 17:7 A young Levite man happened to be visiting there from Bethlehem in the territory of Judah. 
07Jdg 17:8 The man had left his city Bethlehem in Judah to live wherever he could. As he traveled along, he eventually arrived at Micah's house in the mountainous region of Ephraim, looking for work.
07Jdg 17:9 Micah asked him, "Where did you come from?" He replied, "I'm a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I'm going to stay temporarily wherever I can find a place.17
07Jdg 17:10 So Micah replied, "Come live with me! You can be a spiritual father to me, as well as a priest. I'll pay you ten silver coins a year, plus a priestly uniform and an income." So the Levite moved in. 
07Jdg 17:11 The Levite agreed to live with the man, and the young man became like one of the family. 
07Jdg 17:12 Micah set up the Levite in ministry, and the young man became his priest while he lived in Micah's house. 
07Jdg 17:13 As for Micah, he kept saying, "Now I know the Lord will make me rich, because I have a Levite for a priest!"
07Jdg 18:1 Back in those days, Israel didn't have a king yet, and during that time the tribe of Dan had been seeking a territorial inheritance to live in, because up until that time no territory had been allotted to them as a possession among the tribes of Israel. 
07Jdg 18:2 So the tribe of Dan sent from their families five valiant men of their number from Zorah and Eshtaol to scout the land and search through it. Following their orders, which were "Go and scout the land," they came to the mountainous region of Ephraim, arrived at Micah's home, and stayed there.
07Jdg 18:3 As they approached Micah's home, they recognized the voice of the young Levite man. They turned aside from there and spoke to him, asking him, "Who brought you here?What work are you doing here?And what's your business here?"
07Jdg 18:4 He answered, "Micah did such and such for me, and has hired me, so I've become his priest."
07Jdg 18:5 They replied, "Go ask God, please, about whether or not we'll be successful in this journey."
07Jdg 18:6 The priest responded to them, "Travel in peace. The mission that you're to accomplish is from the Lord."
07Jdg 18:7 So the five men left and went to Laish, and observed the people who were living there carefree, as Sidonians tend to do, in peace and quiet. There was no ruler in the land oppressing them for any reason. They were living far away from the Sidonians, and had no dealings with anyone. 
07Jdg 18:8 When they returned to their relatives at Zorah and Eshtaol, their relatives asked them, "What's your report?"
07Jdg 18:9 They replied, "Let's get going and attack them. We've scouted out the land - and look! - it's a very good one. Why should we sit still?We can't wait to go back, invade, and take over the land. 
07Jdg 18:10 When you invade, you'll meet a carefree people living in a spacious territory. God has given it into your control - it's a place that lacks nothing on this earth!" 
07Jdg 18:11 So 600 Danites from Zorah and Eshtaol set out for battle, armed with military weapons. 
07Jdg 18:12 They went out and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in the territory of Judah. (That's why they call the place Mahaneh-dan to this day. It lies west of Kiriath-jearim.) 
07Jdg 18:13 They proceeded from there to the mountainous region of Ephraim and arrived at Micah's house.
07Jdg 18:14 Then the five men who had gone to scout out the territory of Laish told their relatives, "Are you aware that in these houses there's an ephod, some household idols, a carved image, and a cast image?You know what you need to do." 
07Jdg 18:15 So they turned aside from there, went to Micah's house, and greeted him.
07Jdg 18:16 While the 600 Danite soldiers, armed with military weapons, stood guard at the entrance to the gate, 
07Jdg 18:17 the five men who had gone to scout out the land arrived, entered Micah's home and took possession of the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the cast image. Meanwhile, the priest stood outside by the entrance to the gate with the 600 men armed with military weapons.
07Jdg 18:18 After they went into Micah's home and took the carved image, the ephod, the household idols, and the cast image, the priest challenged them. "What are you doing?" he asked them.
07Jdg 18:19 They told him, "Shut up and keep quiet. Come with us and be our spiritual father and priest. It's better for you, isn't it, to be a priest to an entire tribe and family in Israel than to be priest to the home of one man?" 
07Jdg 18:20 The priest was happy to oblige, so he took the ephod, the household idols, and the carved image and went along with the army.19
07Jdg 18:21 Then they turned around and left, sending their little ones, their livestock, and their valuables on ahead. 
07Jdg 18:22 When they had been gone a short distance from Micah's home, some of Micah's neighbors assembled a search party and overtook the Danites. 
07Jdg 18:23 They yelled at the Danites, who turned around to face Micah and asked, "What's wrong with you?You've assembled together¡¦?"
07Jdg 18:24 Micah replied, "You took my gods that I crafted, along with the priest, and left! What do I have left?So what's with this 'What's wrong with you?'"
07Jdg 18:25 The Danites answered him, "You had better not talk to us about this, or else these bad guys here will attack you. You will lose your life, along with the lives of your whole household." 
07Jdg 18:26 Then the Danites went on their way. Because Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back home. 
07Jdg 18:27 But the Danites took what Micah had made, along with the priest who had worked for him, and went to Laish, to a quiet and carefree people, and killed them with swords. Then they set fire to the city. 
07Jdg 18:28 They had no one else to deliver them, because they lived far from Sidon and had no dealings with anyone. It lay in the valley near Beth-rehob. They rebuilt the city and lived in it. 
07Jdg 18:29 They renamed the city Dan, after the name of their ancestor Dan, who had been born in Israel. The former name of the city was Laish.1828
07Jdg 18:30 The Danites set up the carved image, and Gershom's son Jonathan, a descendant of Manasseh, served along with his descendants as priests to the tribe of Dan until the land was taken captive. 
07Jdg 18:31 Micah's carved image, that he himself had crafted, was in place during the entire time that God's tabernacle was set up at Shiloh.
07Jdg 19:1 Now it happened in those days, before there was a king in Israel, that a certain Levite man, who lived in a remote part of the mountainous region of Ephraim, took a mistress for himself from Bethlehem in the territory of Judah. 
07Jdg 19:2 But his mistress was sexually unfaithful to him, and then she left him to live in her father's home in Bethlehem in the territory of Judah. She had been living there for a period of about four months 
07Jdg 19:3 when her husband got up and went after her, intending to speak lovingly to her in order to win her back. He took with him his young man servant and a pair of donkeys. When she brought him into her father's house to see him, her father was happy to have met him.
07Jdg 19:4 The young woman's father (that is, his father-in-law) made him stay there for three days while they ate and drank during his visit there. 
07Jdg 19:5 On the fourth day, they got up early that morning, and the Levite got ready to leave. Then the young woman's father-in-law said to him, "Fortify yourself by eating some food before you go." 
07Jdg 19:6 So both of them sat down for a bit, ate and drank together, and the young woman's father invited the man, "Please, enjoy yourself and spend another night." 
07Jdg 19:7 The man got up, intending to leave, but his father-in-law urged him to spend the night there again.
07Jdg 19:8 On the fifth day, he got up early in the morning, but the young woman's father-in-law said to him, "Please, fortify yourself," so they delayed until later that afternoon while both of them ate together. 
07Jdg 19:9 When the man got up to leave with his mistress and servant, his father-in-law, the young woman's father, said to him, "Look now, evening is coming, so please spend another night. See how the daylight is fading, so spend the night here and enjoy yourself. Then tomorrow get up early and leave on your journey home."
07Jdg 19:10 Because the man was unwilling to spend the night, he got up, left, and arrived opposite Jebus (now known as Jerusalem). He had with him a pair of saddled donkeys, along with his mistress. 
07Jdg 19:11 As they approached Jebus, the daylight was almost gone, so the servant suggested to his master, "Come on, let's spend the night in this Jebusite city."
07Jdg 19:12 But his master replied, "We're not going to turn aside into a city of foreigners who are not part of the Israelites. Instead, we'll go on to Gibeah." 
07Jdg 19:13 He also told his servant, "Come on, let's go to one of these places and spend the night in Gibeah or Ramah." 
07Jdg 19:14 So they continued on their way, and the sun set on them near Gibeah, which is part of Benjamin's territorial allotment. 
07Jdg 19:15 They turned aside there, intending to enter Gibeah and spend the night. After they entered the city, they had to sit down in the public square because no one would take them into their home for the night. 
07Jdg 19:16 Just then, an old man was coming out of the fields that evening from work. The man was from the mountainous region of Ephraim and had been staying in Gibeah, even though the men of that place were Benjaminites. 
07Jdg 19:17 As the old man looked up and saw the traveling man in the public square of the city, he asked, "Now then, where are you headed?And where are you from?"
07Jdg 19:18 He replied, "We're traveling from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote part of the mountainous region of Ephraim, because I'm from there, and I've been visiting Bethlehem in Judah. I'm going home now, but no one will take me into his home. 
07Jdg 19:19 Meanwhile, we also have straw and fodder for our donkeys, and bread and wine for me, for this young woman servant, and for the young man who is with your servants. We don't need anything else."18
07Jdg 19:20 The old man replied, "Don't be alarmed. I'll take care of all your needs. Just don't spend the night in the public square." 
07Jdg 19:21 So he took him into his home and fed the donkeys while they refreshed themselves and had dinner."
07Jdg 19:22 While they were enjoying themselves, all of a sudden certain ungodly men who lived in the city surrounded the house, pounded on the door, and ordered the old man who owned the home, "Bring out the man who came to visit your home so we can have sex with him."19
07Jdg 19:23 The man who owned the house went out to talk to them and pleaded with them, "No, my brothers, please don't act so wickedly. This man is my guest! Don't try to do this stupid thing. 
07Jdg 19:24 Instead, here's my virgin daughter and my visitor's mistress. Please let me bring them out to you. Occupy yourselves with them, and do to them whatever you would like. But don't commit such a stupid thing against this man."1923
07Jdg 19:25 But the men were unwilling to listen to him. So the Levite grabbed his mistress, took her out to them, and they raped and tortured her all night until morning. Then they released her as the first daylight was beginning to appear. 
07Jdg 19:26 As dawn was breaking, the woman approached the door of the man's home where her master was and collapsed. Eventually, full daylight came. 
07Jdg 19:27 When her master got up that morning and opened the doors of the house to leave on his way, there was his mistress, fallen dead at the door of the house with her hands grasping the threshold.
07Jdg 19:28 He spoke to her, "Get up, and let's go." But there was no response. So he placed her on the donkey, mounted his own animal, and went home. 
07Jdg 19:29 When he arrived home, he grabbed a knife, took hold of his mistress, cut her apart limb by limb into twelve pieces, and sent her remains throughout the land of Israel. 
07Jdg 19:30 All the witnesses said, "Nothing has happened or has been seen like this from the day the Israelites came here from the land of Egypt to this day! Think about it, get some advice about it, and then speak up about it!"
07Jdg 20:1 Then the entire Israelite nation - from Dan to Beersheba, including the territory of Gilead - came out for war. The army assembled as one united force to God at Mizpah. 
07Jdg 20:2 The officials of the entire nation, including every tribe of Israel, took their stand in the assembly of the people of God£º 400,000 foot soldiers, all of them expert swordsmen.
07Jdg 20:3 While the Benjaminites were learning that the Israelites had gone up to Mizpah, the Israelites asked, "Somebody tell us how this evil could happen?"
07Jdg 20:4 So the Levite, the husband of the murdered woman, spoke up and replied, "I came to spend the night at Gibeah, which is part of Benjamin, along with my mistress. 
07Jdg 20:5 But the officials of Gibeah attacked me and surrounded the house because of me. They intended to kill me, but instead they tortured my mistress to death. 
07Jdg 20:6 So I grabbed my mistress, cut her in pieces, and sent her remains throughout the territory of Israel's inheritance, because they've committed a vile, stupid outrage in Israel. 
07Jdg 20:7 So look, all you sons of Israel! Speak up and give us your advice!"
07Jdg 20:8 Then the entire army stood up as a single unit and declared, "Nobody's going back to his tent, and nobody's going home! 
07Jdg 20:9 This is what we'll do to Gibeah£º we're going to assemble an army by lottery. 
07Jdg 20:10 We'll take ten men out of 100 from all of the tribes of Israel. We'll appoint 100 out of 1,000 and 1,000 out of 10,000 to supply provisions for the army. And when we reach Gibeah in the territory of Benjamin, we'll punish them for all of the stupid things that they've done in Israel." 
07Jdg 20:11 That's how the army of Israel came to be gathered together to attack the city, united as a single unit.
07Jdg 20:12 The tribes of Israel sent men throughout the entire tribe of Benjaminites to ask them, "What is this evil thing that has occurred among you?
07Jdg 20:13 Now then, hand over the men - those ungodly men, and we'll execute them in order to remove this evil from Israel." But the Benjaminites wouldn't obey the request of their own relatives, the Israelites, 
07Jdg 20:14 so the Benjaminites assembled from the cities of Gibeah to fight the Israelites in battle. 
07Jdg 20:15 The day of the battle, the Benjaminite army numbered 26,000 expert swordsmen from their cities, not including the inhabitants of Gibeah, who numbered 700 special forces soldiers. 
07Jdg 20:16 Out of all these soldiers, 700 of them were left-handed - and each one could sling a stone at a hair and never miss. 
07Jdg 20:17 But the Israelite army - not counting the tribe of Benjamin - numbered 400,000 expert swordsmen, all of them battle-hardened soldiers.
07Jdg 20:18 The Israelites mounted up, traveled to Bethel, and asked God what to do. They said, "Who is to lead us in our opening attack against the Benjaminites?" The Lord replied, "Judah shall open the attack."
07Jdg 20:19 So the Israelites got up in the morning, encamped near Gibeah, 
07Jdg 20:20 and the army of Israel went out to fight the tribe of Benjamin, assembling in battle array against them at Gibeah. 
07Jdg 20:21 The Benjaminites came out of Gibeah, and 22,000 soldiers of Israel fell in battle that day.
07Jdg 20:22 But the army - the men of Israel?encouraged themselves and arrayed for battle again the next day in the same place where they had gathered the day before. 
07Jdg 20:23 From there the Israelites went up and wept in the Lord's presence until evening. Then they asked the Lord, "Should we attack the descendants of Benjamin again?" The Lord replied, "Attack them."
07Jdg 20:24 So the Israelites attacked the Benjaminites for a second day, 
07Jdg 20:25 and the tribe of Benjamin went to war against them from Gibeah during that second day, and 18,000 soldiers from the Israelites - all expert swordsmen - fell to the ground. 
07Jdg 20:26 All the Israelites, including its army, went up from there to Bethel and wept, remaining there in the Lord's presence, fasting throughout the day until dusk, when they offered burnt offerings and peace offerings in the Lord's presence. 
07Jdg 20:27 The Israelites inquired of the Lord, since the ark of the covenant was there at that time 
07Jdg 20:28 while Eleazar's son Phinehas, a descendant of Aaron, served before it in those days. They asked, "Should we go out to war again against the descendants of our relative Benjamin, or shall we cease?" And the Lord answered, "Go out, and tomorrow I will deliver them into your control."
07Jdg 20:29 So Israel set soldiers in ambush around Gibeah. 
07Jdg 20:30 The Israelites went out against the Benjaminites on the third day, arraying themselves against Gibeah as they had done previously. 
07Jdg 20:31 They attacked the army and were drawn away from the city as they began to inflict casualties on the soldiers along the roads to Bethel and Gibeah, just as they had done the other times. About 30 soldiers from Israel fell in battle there and in the fields.30
07Jdg 20:32 Then the Benjaminites told themselves, "They're falling right in front of us, just like before!" But the army of Israel said to themselves, "Let's draw them away by escaping to the highways from the city." 
07Jdg 20:33 So the entire army of Israel moved from their location and arrayed themselves at Baal-Tamer while that part of their army moved from their ambush positions from Maareh-geba. 
07Jdg 20:34 As 10,000 of Israel's best soldiers came to fight Gibeah, the battle became fierce, but the army of Benjamin didn't know that disaster was close at hand. 
07Jdg 20:35 The Lord struck Benjamin in the full view of Israel. As a result, the Israelites destroyed 25,100 soldiers of Benjamin that day, all expert swordsmen.
07Jdg 20:36 Then the Benjaminites realized that they had been defeated. The army of Israel pretended to retreat from the army of Benjamin, knowing that they had set some soldiers in ambush near Gibeah. 
07Jdg 20:37 The soldiers in ambush rushed out to attack Gibeah, deploying in force and executing the entire city with swords. 
07Jdg 20:38 Meanwhile, the army of Israel had arranged to signal their soldiers who had been hiding in ambush by sending up a cloud of smoke from the city. 
07Jdg 20:39 The army of Israel turned around in the battle, and the army of Benjamin began to attack and kill about 30 soldiers, thinking, "Now we're really defeating them, just like before."20
07Jdg 20:40 But then the smoke began to rise from the city in a column. The army of Benjamin observed behind them that the whole city was going up in flames straight into the sky! 
07Jdg 20:41 At that point, as the army of Israel turned back to face the army of Benjamin, the army of Benjamin was filled with terror, because they realized that disaster was about to overtake them. 
07Jdg 20:42 So they turned tail and ran away from the army of Israel toward the wilderness, but they were overtaken in battle when soldiers came out from the cities to destroy them. 
07Jdg 20:43 They surrounded the army of Benjamin, pursuing them ceaselessly until they defeated them near the east-facing border of Gibeah. 
07Jdg 20:44 That's how 18,000 men from the tribe of Benjamin fell in battle, all of whom were valiant soldiers. 
07Jdg 20:45 The rest of them turned and ran into the wilderness in the direction of the rock of Rimmon, but 5,000 of them were killed on the highways while 2,000 of them were overtaken and killed near Gidom.
07Jdg 20:46 To sum up, the soldiers from the tribe of Benjamin who died that day totaled 25,000 men, all of them expert swordsmen and valiant soldiers. 
07Jdg 20:47 However, 600 soldiers ran into the wilderness in the direction of the rock of Rimmon, where they remained as fugitives for four months. 
07Jdg 20:48 Meanwhile, the army of Israel went back to fight the surviving Benjaminites. They attacked the entire city with swords, including its cattle and everyone they could find. Then they set fire to all of the cities that they could find.
07Jdg 21:1 Now the people of Israel had taken a vow in Mizpah that went like this£º "Not even one of us will give his daughter in marriage to a Benjaminite!" 
07Jdg 21:2 So the people went to Bethel, sat before God until dusk, where they cried out loud and wept bitterly. 
07Jdg 21:3 "Why, Lord God of Israel," they asked him, "is one tribe missing from Israel?"
07Jdg 21:4 The next day, the people got up early, built an altar, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. 
07Jdg 21:5 The Israelites asked themselves, "Who didn't come up in our assembly in the Lord's presence from among all of the tribes of Israel?" They had taken a solemn oath concerning those who didn't come up to meet with the Lord at Mizpah that "They will certainly be executed."
07Jdg 21:6 But the Israelites were mourning for their relatives in the tribe of Benjamin. They announced, "One tribe has been eliminated from Israel today! 
07Jdg 21:7 What can we do to find wives for the survivors who remain, since we've already taken an oath in the Lord's presence not to give them any of our daughters in marriage?"
07Jdg 21:8 They asked, "What one group of the tribes of Israel didn't come up to meet the Lord at Mizpah?" It turned out that no one had come to the encampment from Jabesh-gilead, 
07Jdg 21:9 since when they took a census of the assembly, not even one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was in attendance. 
07Jdg 21:10 So the congregation sent out 12,000 of their valiant soldiers, issuing these orders to them£º "Go and attack the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with swords, including the woman and little ones. 
07Jdg 21:11 You're to completely destroy every man and every married woman."
07Jdg 21:12 They discovered among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who hadn't had sex with a man, and they brought them to the encampment at Shiloh in the territory of Canaan. 
07Jdg 21:13 Then the entire congregation sent for the surviving Benjaminites who were living at the rock of Rimmon and assured them that their intentions toward them were peaceful. 
07Jdg 21:14 So the survivors of the tribe of Benjamin returned at that time, and the Israelites gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the raid on Jabesh-gilead. Even so, there weren't enough for them.
07Jdg 21:15 The people felt sorry for the tribe of Benjamin because the Lord had broken one of the tribes of Israel. 
07Jdg 21:16 So the elders of the congregation asked, "What shall we do to obtain wives for the survivors, since the women of Benjamin have been devastated?" 
07Jdg 21:17 They continued, "Let's make sure that there's an inheritance for the survivors of the tribe of Benjamin, so that a tribe won't be blotted out from Israel. 
07Jdg 21:18 But we can't give them wives from our own daughters, since we've taken this vow£º 'May the Lord curse anyone who gives his daughter as a wife to the tribe of Benjamin!'"16
07Jdg 21:19 So they concluded, "Look, there's a feast to the Lord every year in Shiloh on the north side of Bethel, south of Lebonah and on the east side of the highway that runs from Bethel to Shechem¡¦" 
07Jdg 21:20 So they told the Benjaminites, "Go and hide in the vineyards. 
07Jdg 21:21 Watch when the unmarried women from Shiloh come out to participate in the dances. Then come out of the vineyards and each of you grab a wife from the unmarried women from Shiloh. Then go back home to the territory of Benjamin. 
07Jdg 21:22 If their fathers or brothers come complaining to us, we'll tell them 'Be generous! Give them to us voluntarily, because we didn't take anyone to be a wife for the men of the tribe of Benjamin as a result of the battle. And you haven't incurred guilt by giving your daughters to them.'"
07Jdg 21:23 So the Benjaminites did all of this£º they chose and carried away just enough wives from those who danced to meet the number needed, then they left to return to their inheritance, to rebuild their cities, and to live there. 
07Jdg 21:24 The Israelites left there at that time, each man to his tribe and family, and each of them went down from there to his territorial allotment.
07Jdg 21:25 Back in those days, Israel didn't yet have a king, so each person did whatever seemed right in his own opinion.
08
08Ru 1:1 Now there came a time of famine while judges were ruling in the land of Israel. A man from Bethlehem of Judah, his wife, and his two sons left to live in the country of Moab. 
08Ru 1:2 The man's name was Elimelech, his wife's name was Naomi, and their two sons were named Mahlon and Chilion - Ephrathites from Bethlehem of Judah. They journeyed to the country of Moab and lived there for some time.
08Ru 1:3 Then Naomi's husband Elimelech died, and she was left with her two sons. 
08Ru 1:4 Each of her sons married Moabite women£º one named Orpah and the other named Ruth. After they lived there about ten years, 
08Ru 1:5 both Mahlon and Chilion died, leaving Naomi alone with neither her husband nor her two sons.
08Ru 1:6 She and her daughters-in-law prepared to return from the country of Moab, because she had heard while living there how the Lord had come to the aid of his people, giving them relief. 
08Ru 1:7 So she left the place where she had been, along with her two daughters-in-law, and they traveled along the return road to the land of Judah.
08Ru 1:8 But along the way, Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, "Each of you go back home. Return to your mother's house. May the Lord show his gracious love to you, as you have shown me and our loved ones who have died. 
08Ru 1:9 May the Lord grant each of you security in your new husbands' households." Then she kissed them good-bye, and they cried loudly.
08Ru 1:10 They both replied to her, "No! We will go back with you to your people."
08Ru 1:11 But Naomi responded, "Go back, my daughters. Why go with me?Are there still sons to be born to me as future husbands for you?
08Ru 1:12 So go on back, my daughters! Be on your way! I'm too old to remarry. If I were to say that I'm hoping for a husband tonight and then also bore sons this very night, 
08Ru 1:13 would you wait for them until they were grown?Would you refrain from marriage for them?No, my daughters! I'm more deeply grieved than you, because the Lord is working against me!"
08Ru 1:14 They began to cry loudly again. So Orpah kissed her mother-in-law good-bye, but Ruth remained with her. 
08Ru 1:15 Naomi said to Ruth, "Look, your sister-in-law has returned to her people and to her gods. Follow your sister-in-law!"
08Ru 1:16 But Ruth answered, "Stop urging me to abandon you and to turn back from following you. Because wherever you go, I'll go. Wherever you live, I'll live. Your people will be my people, and your God, my God. 
08Ru 1:17 Where you die, I'll die and be buried. May the Lord do this to me - and more - if anything except death comes between you and me."
08Ru 1:18 When Naomi observed Ruth's determination to travel with her, she ended the conversation. 
08Ru 1:19 So they continued on until they reached Bethlehem. Now when the two of them arrived in Bethlehem, the entire town got excited at the news of their arrival and they asked one another, "Can this be Naomi?"
08Ru 1:20 But Naomi replied, "Don't call me 'Naomi'! Call me 'Mara'! That's because the Almighty has dealt bitterly with me. 
08Ru 1:21 I left here full, but the Lord brought me back empty. So why call me 'Naomi'?After all, the Lord is against me, and the Almighty has broken me."1
08Ru 1:22 So Naomi returned to Bethlehem from the country of Moab, along with her daughter-in-law Ruth the Moabite woman. And they arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.
08Ru 2:1 Naomi had a close relative of her late husband, a man of considerable wealth from the family of Elimelech. His name was Boaz.
08Ru 2:2 Ruth the Moabite said to Naomi, "Please allow me to go out to the fields and glean grain behind anyone who shows me kindness." So Naomi replied, "Go ahead, my daughter."
08Ru 2:3 So she went out, proceeded to the field, and gleaned behind the harvesters. And it happened that she came to the portion of land belonging to Boaz, of the family of Elimelech.
08Ru 2:4 Now when Boaz arrived from Bethlehem, he said to the harvesters, "The Lord be with you." "May the Lord bless you!" they replied.
08Ru 2:5 At this point, Boaz asked the foreman of his harvesters, "To whom does this young woman belong?"
08Ru 2:6 The foreman of the harvesters answered, "She is the Moabite who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. 
08Ru 2:7 She asked us, 'Please allow me to glean what's left of the grain behind the harvesters.' So she came out and has continued working from dawn until now, except for a short time in a shelter."
08Ru 2:8 Boaz then addressed Ruth£º "Listen, my daughter! Don't glean in any other field. Don't even leave this one, and be sure to stay close to my women servants. 
08Ru 2:9 Keep your eyes on the field where they are harvesting, and follow them. I have ordered my young men not to bother you, have I not?And when you are thirsty, drink from the water vessels that the young men have filled."
08Ru 2:10 At this she fell prostrate, bowing low to the ground, and asked him, "Why is it that you're showing me kindness by noticing me, since I'm a foreigner?"
08Ru 2:11 Boaz answered her, "It has been clearly disclosed to me all that you have done for your mother-in-law following the death of your husband - how you abandoned your father, your mother, and your own land, and came to a people you did not previously know. 
08Ru 2:12 May the Lord repay you for your work, and may a full reward be given you from the Lord God of Israel, under whose wings you have come for refuge."
08Ru 2:13 She responded, "May I continue to find favor in your sight, sir, since you've been comforting me and you have spoken graciously to your servant, even though I am not one of your servants."
08Ru 2:14 At lunchtime, Boaz invited her, "Come on over, have some food, and dip your bread in our oil and vinegar." So she sat down beside the harvesters, and he handed her some roasted grain, which she ate until she was satisfied. She kept what was left over.
08Ru 2:15 After she had left to glean, Boaz commanded his servants, "Allow her to glean also among the cut sheaves, and don't taunt her. 
08Ru 2:16 One other thing - drop some handfuls deliberately, leaving them for her so she can gather it. And don't bother her." 
08Ru 2:17 So Ruth gathered grain out in the field until dusk, and then threshed what she had gathered - about a week's supply of barley. 
08Ru 2:18 She picked up her grain and went back to town.17 Her mother-in-law noticed how much Ruth had gleaned and had brought back from what was left over from her lunch. 
08Ru 2:19 So her mother-in-law quizzed her, "Where did you glean today?Where, precisely, did you work?May the one who took notice of you be blessed."2 So Ruth told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked. She said, "The man's name with whom I worked today is Boaz."
08Ru 2:20 Naomi replied, "May the one who hasn't abandoned his gracious love to the living or to the dead be blessed by the Lord." Naomi added, "This man is closely related to us, our related redeemer, as a matter of fact!"
08Ru 2:21 Then Ruth the Moabite woman added, "He also told me 'Stay close to my young men until they have completed my entire harvest.'"
08Ru 2:22 Naomi responded to her daughter-in-law Ruth, "It is prudent, my daughter, for you to go out with his women servants, so someone won't attack you in another field." 
08Ru 2:23 So Ruth continued to stay close to the young women who worked for Boaz, gathering grain until both the barley and wheat harvests were complete, all the while living with her mother-in-law.
08Ru 3:1 Ruth's mother-in-law Naomi, told her, "My daughter, should I not make inquiries about your financial security, so you'll be better off in life?
08Ru 3:2 Isn't Boaz one of our close relatives?You've been associating with his women servants lately. Look, he'll be winnowing barley at the threshing floor tonight. 
08Ru 3:3 So get cleaned up, put on some perfume, dress up, and go to the threshing floor, but don't let him see you until after he's finished eating and drinking. 
08Ru 3:4 When he lies down, be sure to notice where he is resting. Then go over, uncover his feet, and lie down. He'll tell you what to do."
08Ru 3:5 Ruth replied, "I'll do everything you've said." 
08Ru 3:6 So she went out to the threshing floor and did precisely what her mother-in-law had advised.
08Ru 3:7 After Boaz had finished eating and drinking to his heart's content, he went over and laid down next to the pile of threshed grain. Ruth came in quietly, uncovered his feet, and lay down. 
08Ru 3:8 In the middle of the night, Boaz was startled awake and turned over in surprise to see a woman lying at his feet.
08Ru 3:9 He asked her, "Who are you?" She answered, "I'm only Ruth, your servant. Spread the edge of your garment over your servant, because you are my related redeemer."
08Ru 3:10 He replied, "May you be blessed by the Lord, my daughter. You've added to the gracious love you've already demonstrated by not pursuing younger men, whether rich or poor. 
08Ru 3:11 Don't be afraid, my daughter. I'll do for you everything that you have asked, since all of my people in town are aware that you're a virtuous woman. 
08Ru 3:12 It's true that I'm your related redeemer, but there is another related redeemer even closer than I. 
08Ru 3:13 Stay the night, and if he fulfills his duty as your related redeemer in the morning, that will be acceptable. But if he isn't inclined to do so, then, as the Lord lives, I will act as your related redeemer myself. So lie down until morning."
08Ru 3:14 So she lay down at his feet until dawn approached, then got up while it was still difficult for anyone to be recognized. Then he told her, "It shouldn't be known that a woman has come to the threshing floor." 
08Ru 3:15 So he said, "Take your cloak and hold it out." She did so, and he measured out six units of barley and placed them in a sack on her. Then she left for town.
08Ru 3:16 When Ruth returned to her mother-in-law, Naomi asked her, "How did it go, my daughter?" Then she related everything that the man had done for her. 
08Ru 3:17 Ruth also said, "He gave me these six units of barley and told me, 'Don't go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.'"3
08Ru 3:18 Naomi replied, "Be patient, my daughter, until you learn how this works out, because the man won't rest until he finishes everything today."
08Ru 4:1 Meanwhile, Boaz approached the city gate and sat down there. Just then, the very same related redeemer whom Boaz had mentioned came by, so Boaz called out to him, "Come over and sit down here, my friend!" So the man came over and sat down.
08Ru 4:2 Boaz selected ten of the town elders and spoke to them, "Sit down here." So they sat down 
08Ru 4:3 and Boaz addressed the related redeemer directly£º "A portion of a field belonging to our relative Elimelech is up for sale by Naomi, who recently returned from the country of Moab. 
08Ru 4:4 So I thought to myself I ought to tell you that you must make a public purchase of this before the town residents and the elders of my people. So if you intend to act as the related redeemer, then do so. But if not, let me know, because except for you - and I after you - there is no one to fulfill the duties of a related redeemer." The man responded, "I will act as related redeemer."
08Ru 4:5 Boaz continued, "On the very day you buy the field from Naomi, you're also "buying" Ruth the Moabite woman, the wife of her dead husband, so the family name may be continued as an inheritance."
08Ru 4:6 At this, the nearer related redeemer replied, "Then I am unable to act as related redeemer, because that would complicate my own inheritance. You act instead as the related redeemer, because I cannot do so."
08Ru 4:7 During Israel's earlier history, all things concerning redeeming or changing inheritances were confirmed by a man taking off his sandal and giving it to the other party, thereby creating a public record in Israel.
08Ru 4:8 So when the nearer related redeemer said to Boaz, "Make the purchase yourself," he then took off his sandal.
08Ru 4:9 At this, Boaz addressed the elders and all of the people£º "You all are witnesses today that I hereby redeem everything from Naomi that belonged to Elimelech, including what belonged to Chilion and Mahlon, 
08Ru 4:10 along with Mahlon's wife Ruth the Moabite woman. I will marry her to continue the family name as an inheritance, so that the name of the deceased does not disappear from among his relatives, nor from the public record. You are all witnesses today!"
08Ru 4:11 Then all of the assembled people - along with the elders who were there - said, "We are witnesses! May the Lord make this woman who enters your house like Rachel and Leah, who together established the house of Israel. May you prosper in Ephrathah, and may you excel in Bethlehem! 
08Ru 4:12 Moreover, may your house be like the house of Perez, whom Tamar bore to Judah, from the offspring that the Lord gives you from this young woman."
08Ru 4:13 So Boaz took Ruth to be his wife, and when he had marital relations with her, the Lord made her conceive, and she bore a son. 
08Ru 4:14 Then the women of Bethlehem said to Naomi, "May the Lord be blessed, who has not left you today without a related redeemer. May his name become famous throughout Israel! 
08Ru 4:15 And he will restore your life for you and will support you in your old age, because your daughter-in-law, who loves you and who has borne him, is better for you than seven sons!"
08Ru 4:16 Naomi took care of the child, taking him to her breast and becoming his nurse. 
08Ru 4:17 So her women neighbors gave the child a nickname, which is "Naomi has a son!" They named him Obed. He became the father of Jesse, who was the father of David.
08Ru 4:18 This is the genealogy of Perez£º Perez fathered Hezron, 
08Ru 4:19 Hezron fathered Ram, and Ram fathered Amminadab. 
08Ru 4:20 Amminadab fathered Nashon, and Nashon fathered Salmon. 
08Ru 4:21 Salmon fathered Boaz, and Boaz fathered Obed. 22Then Obed fathered Jesse, who fathered David.

091Sm 1:1 A certain man lived in Ramathaim Zophim, which is in the hill country of Ephraim. He was Jeroham's son Elkanah, the grandson of Jeroham, Elihu's son and grandson of Tohu, who was the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 
091Sm 1:2 He had two wives; the name of one was Hannah and the name of the other was Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children. 
091Sm 1:3 That man would go up from his town each year to worship and sacrifice to the Lord of the Heavenly Armies at Shiloh, where Eli's two sons Hophni and Phineas served as priests of the Lord. 
091Sm 1:4 On the day when Elkanah offered sacrifices, he would give portions to his wife Peninnah and to all her sons and daughters, 
091Sm 1:5 but he would give twice as much to Hannah because he loved her. Now the Lord had closed her womb. 
091Sm 1:6 Her rival would provoke her severely so that she complained loudly because the Lord had closed her womb. 
091Sm 1:7 Elkanah would do this year after year, as often as Hannah went up to the house of the Lord. Likewise, Peninnah would provoke her, and Hannah would cry and would not eat. 
091Sm 1:8 Elkanah her husband said to her, "Hannah, why are you crying and why don't you eat?Why are you upset?Am I not better to you than ten sons?" 
091Sm 1:9 Hannah got up after she had finished eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on the chair by the doorpost of the tabernacle of the Lord. 
091Sm 1:10 Deeply distressed, she prayed to the Lord and wept bitterly. 
091Sm 1:11 Hannah made a vow£º "Lord of the Heavenly Armies, if you just look at the misery of your maid servant, remember me, and don't forget your maid servant. If you give your maid servant a son, then I'll give him to the Lord for all the days of his life, and a razor shall never touch his head." 
091Sm 1:12 As she continued to pray in the Lord's presence, Eli was watching her mouth. 
091Sm 1:13 Hannah was praying inwardly. Her lips were quivering, and her voice could not be heard. So Eli thought she was drunk. 
091Sm 1:14 Eli said to her, "How long will you stay drunk?Put away your wine!"
091Sm 1:15 "No, sir!" Hannah replied. "I'm a deeply troubled woman. I've drunk neither wine nor beer. I've been pouring out my soul in the Lord's presence. 
091Sm 1:16 Don't consider your maid servant a worthless woman. Rather, all this time I've been speaking because I'm very anxious and distressed."
091Sm 1:17 "Go in peace," Eli answered. "May the God of Israel grant the request you have asked of him."
091Sm 1:18 She said, "Let your servant find favor in your eyes." Then she went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad. 
091Sm 1:19 They got up early the next morning and worshipped in the Lord's presence, and then they returned and came to their house at Ramah. Elkanah had marital relations with his wife Hannah, and the Lord remembered her. 
091Sm 1:20 By the time of the next year's sacrifice, Hannah had become pregnant and had borne a son. She named him Samuel because she said, "I asked the Lord for him."
091Sm 1:21 Then Elkanah went up with all his family to offer the yearly sacrifice to the Lord and pay his vow. 
091Sm 1:22 Hannah did not go up because she had said to her husband, "As soon as the child is weaned, I'll take him to appear in the Lord's presence and remain there forever.
091Sm 1:23 "Do what you want," Elkanah said to her. "Stay until you have weaned him, only may the Lord bring about what you have said." So Hannah stayed and nursed her son until she had weaned him. 
091Sm 1:24 Then, when she had weaned him, she brought him up with her to Shiloh, along with a three-year-old bull, a half-bushel of flour, and a skin of wine. She brought him to the house of the Lord at Shiloh, and the boy was young. 
091Sm 1:25 They slaughtered the bull and brought the boy to Eli.123
091Sm 1:26 Hannah said, "Sir, as surely as you are alive, I'm the woman who stood before you here praying to the Lord. 
091Sm 1:27 I prayed for this boy, and the Lord granted me the request I asked of him. 
091Sm 1:28 Now I'm dedicating him to the Lord, and as long as he lives, he will be dedicated to the Lord." Then they worshipped the Lord there. 
091Sm 2:1 Then Hannah prayed£º "My heart exults in the Lord; my strength is increased by the Lord. I will open my mouth to speak against my enemies, because I rejoice in your deliverance. 
091Sm 2:2 There is no one holy like the Lord, indeed there is no one besides you, there is no rock like our God. 
091Sm 2:3 Don't continue to talk proudly, and don't speak arrogantly, for the Lord is a God of knowledge, and by him actions are weighed. 
091Sm 2:4 The bows of warriors are shattered, but those who stumble are equipped with strength. 
091Sm 2:5 Those who had an abundance of bread now hire themselves out, and those who were hungry hunger no more. While the barren woman gives birth to seven children, she who had many children languishes. 
091Sm 2:6 The Lord kills and gives life, he brings people down to where the dead are and he raises them up.
091Sm 2:7 The Lord makes people poor and he makes people rich, he brings them low, and he also exalts them. 
091Sm 2:8 He raises the poor up from the dust, he lifts up the needy from the trash heap to make them sit with princes and inherit a seat of honor. Indeed the pillars of the earth belong to the Lord, and he has set the world on them. 
091Sm 2:9 He guards the steps of his faithful ones, while the wicked are made silent in darkness. Indeed it's not by strength that a person prevails. 
091Sm 2:10 The Lord will shatter those who contend against him, he will thunder against them in the heavens. The Lord will judge the ends of the earth, he will give strength to his king, and he will increase the strength of His anointed one." 
091Sm 2:11 Then Elkanah went to his house at Ramah, while the boy was ministering to the Lord in the presence of Eli the priest. 
091Sm 2:12 Now the sons of Eli were worthless men who did not know the Lord. 
091Sm 2:13 The custom of the priests with the people was that whenever a person offered a sacrifice, a servant of the priest would come with a three pronged fork in his hand while the meat was boiling. 
091Sm 2:14 He would stick it into the basin or pot or kettle or pan, and whatever the fork brought up, the priest would take for himself. This is what they were supposed to do with all the Israelites who came there to Shiloh. 
091Sm 2:15 But even before they burned the fat, the servant of the priest would come and say to the person offering the sacrifice, "Give me meat to roast for the priest. He won't accept boiled meat from you, but only raw."
091Sm 2:16 If the man said to him, "They must surely burn up the fat first, and then take for yourself whatever you desire," the servant would say, "No, give it now, and if you don't, I'll take it by force!" 
091Sm 2:17 By doing this, the sin of the young men was very serious in the Lord's sight because the men despised the Lord's offering. 
091Sm 2:18 Now Samuel was ministering in the Lord's presence, as a boy wearing a linen ephod. 
091Sm 2:19 His mother would make a small robe for him, and she would bring it each year when she went up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 
091Sm 2:20 Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, "May the Lord give you descendants from this woman in place of the one she dedicated to the Lord." Then they would return to their home. 
091Sm 2:21 The Lord took note of Hannah, and she became pregnant and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. Meanwhile, the boy Samuel continued to grow, and the Lord was constantly with him.
091Sm 2:22 Now Eli was very old, and he had heard everything that his sons were doing to all Israel, and how they lay with the women who were serving regularly at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting. 
091Sm 2:23 "Why are you doing these things that I'm hearing about?" he asked his sons, "These reports about your evil deeds are coming from all these people! 
091Sm 2:24 No, my sons, I'm not hearing good news being circulated by the Lord's people. 
091Sm 2:25 If a person sins against another, God will mediate for him, but if a person sins against the Lord, who can intercede for him?" But they would not listen to their father; for the Lord wanted to put them to death. 
091Sm 2:26 But the boy Samuel continued to grow both physically and in favor with the Lord and the people. 
091Sm 2:27 A man of God came to Eli, saying to him, "This is what the Lord says£º 'When they were in Egypt and slaves to the house of Pharaoh, did I not reveal to the family of your ancestor Aaron 
091Sm 2:28 that I had chosen him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my priest, to offer up burnt offerings on my altar, burn incense, and carry the ephod in my presence?And did I not give to your ancestors' family all the Israelite fire-offerings?
091Sm 2:29 Why then do all of you show contempt for my sacrifice and offering that I've commanded for my dwelling?And you honor your sons more than me in order to fatten yourselves from the best of all the offerings of my people Israel.'
091Sm 2:30 "Therefore, the Lord God of Israel has declared, 'I did, in fact, say that your family and your ancestor's family would walk before me forever,' but now the Lord declares, 'Far be it from me! The one who honors me I'll honor, and the one who despises me shall be treated with contempt. 
091Sm 2:31 The time is coming when I'll cut away at your family and your ancestor's family until there are no old men left in your family. 
091Sm 2:32 Distress will settle down to live in your household, and despite all the good that I do for Israel, there will never be an old man in your family forever. 
091Sm 2:33 Any of you whom I don't eliminate from serving at my altar will grow tired from weeping, and their souls will grieve. All the increase of your family will die by violence. 
091Sm 2:34 Here's a sign for you - your two sons Hophni and Phineas will both die on the same day! 
091Sm 2:35 And I'll raise up for myself a faithful priest who will do according to what is in my heart and according to my desire. I'll build for him an enduring house and he will walk before my anointed one forever. 
091Sm 2:36 Anyone who remains in your family will come and prostrate themselves before him for a small wage or a loaf of bread and will say, 'Please put me in one of the priest's offices so I can eat a piece of bread.'"'"235
091Sm 3:1 Meanwhile the boy Samuel was serving the Lord before Eli. A word from the Lord was rare in those days, and visions were infrequent. 
091Sm 3:2 At that time Eli, whose vision was growing dim, was lying down in his bedroom. 
091Sm 3:3 The lamp of God had not yet been extinguished, and Samuel was lying down in the tabernacle of the Lord where the Ark of God was. 
091Sm 3:4 The Lord called out to Samuel, who answered, "Here I am."
091Sm 3:5 He ran to Eli and said, "Here I am! You called me." "I didn't call you," Eli said. "Go back and lie down." So he went and lay down.
091Sm 3:6 Then the Lord again called out, "Samuel!" So Samuel got up, went to Eli, and said, "Here I am! You called me." He said, "I didn't call you, my son. Go back and lie down." 
091Sm 3:7 Now Samuel did not yet know the Lord and had not yet had the word of the Lord revealed to him.
091Sm 3:8 Then the Lord called out to Samuel again a third time, and he got up, went to Eli, and said, "Here I am! You called me." Then Eli understood that the Lord was calling the boy, 
091Sm 3:9 so Eli said to Samuel, "Go lie down, and then if he calls you, answer, 'Speak, Lord, because your servant is listening.'" Then Samuel went and lay down.
091Sm 3:10 Later, the Lord came and stood there, calling out, "Samuel! Samuel!" as he had before. Samuel said, "Speak, because your servant is listening."
091Sm 3:11 "Look," the Lord said to Samuel. "I'm about to do something in Israel that will make both ears of anyone who hears it tingle. 
091Sm 3:12 I'll fulfill every promise that I've spoken concerning Eli's family, from beginning to end. 
091Sm 3:13 I've told him that I'm about to judge his family forever because of the iniquity that he knew about. His sons committed blasphemy and he did not rebuke them. 
091Sm 3:14 Therefore I've sworn concerning Eli's family that the iniquity of his family is not to be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever." 
091Sm 3:15 Samuel lay down until morning and then opened the doors of the house of the Lord, but he was afraid to report the vision to Eli. 
091Sm 3:16 Then Eli called Samuel£º "Samuel, my son." He said, "Here I am."
091Sm 3:17 Eli said, "What did the Lord say to you?Please don't conceal anything from me. May God do this to you and even more if you conceal from me one word of all that he spoke to you." 
091Sm 3:18 Samuel told him everything - he did not conceal anything from him. Eli said, "He is the Lord. May he do what seems good to him." 
091Sm 3:19 As Samuel grew, the Lord was with him and did not let any of Samuel's predictions fail. 
091Sm 3:20 All Israel from Dan to Beersheba knew that Samuel was confirmed as the Lord's prophet. 
091Sm 3:21 The Lord continued to appear at Shiloh, because he revealed himself to Samuel at Shiloh by the word of the Lord.         
091Sm 4:1 What Samuel had to say was directed to all Israel, and Israel went out to engage the Philistines in battle. The Israelites were camped at Ebenezer, while the Philistines were camped at Aphek. 
091Sm 4:2 The Philistines deployed their forces to meet Israel, and as the battle spread Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield.
091Sm 4:3 When the people came to the camp, the elders of Israel said, "Why did the Lord defeat us today when we fought the Philistines?Let's take the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord from Shiloh, so it may go with us and deliver us from the power of our enemies." 
091Sm 4:4 So the people sent word to Shiloh and took away from there the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, who sits above the cherubim. Now the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, were there with the Ark of the Covenant of God. 
091Sm 4:5 When the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord came into the camp, all Israel gave a great shout and the earth reverberated! 
091Sm 4:6 When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they asked, "What is this noise the comes from shouting in the camp of the Hebrews?" Then they realized that the Ark of the Lord had come into the camp, 
091Sm 4:7 and the Philistines were terrified. "God has come into the camp," they said. "Woe to us, because nothing like this has ever happened before! 
091Sm 4:8 Woe to us! Who will deliver us from the hand of these mighty gods?These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the desert. 
091Sm 4:9 Philistines, be strong and be men, or you will become slaves to the Hebrews just as they have been slaves to you! Be men and fight!"48
091Sm 4:10 The Philistines fought and Israel was defeated; each of them fled to his own tent. It was a very great slaughter, and 30,000 soldiers of Israel died. 
091Sm 4:11 The Ark of God was captured, and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phineas, died.10
091Sm 4:12 That very same day, a Benjaminite man ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh, with his garments torn and dirt on his head. 
091Sm 4:13 When he arrived, Eli was sitting there on a seat beside the road, watching because his heart trembled for the Ark of God. The man went into the town to give the report, and the whole town cried out. 
091Sm 4:14 Eli heard the sound of the cry and asked, "What is the meaning of this commotion?" Then the man quickly came and told Eli. 
091Sm 4:15 Now Eli was 98 years old, and his vision had failed.
091Sm 4:16 The man said to Eli, "I've just come from the battle line, and I escaped from the battle today." He asked, "What happened, my son?"
091Sm 4:17 The messenger answered, "Israel fled from the Philistines and the people suffered a great defeat as well. Moreover, your two sons, Hophni and Phineas, are dead, and the Ark of God was captured."
091Sm 4:18 When he mentioned the Ark of God, Eli fell off the seat backwards by the side of the gate. His neck was broken and he died, since he was old and heavy. Eli had judged Israel for 40 years. 
091Sm 4:19 Eli's daughter-in-law, the wife of Phineas, was pregnant and ready to give birth. When she heard the report about the capture of the Ark of God and that her father-in-law and husband were dead, she crouched down and gave birth, because her labor pains suddenly began. 
091Sm 4:20 As she was about to die, the women standing around her said, "Don't be afraid! You've given birth to a son." But she did not respond or pay attention. 
091Sm 4:21 She had named the boy Ichabod, saying, "Glory has departed from Israel," because the Ark of God had been captured and because her father-in-law and husband were dead. 
091Sm 4:22 She said, "Glory has departed from Israel, because the Ark of God has been captured." 
091Sm 5:1 The Philistines took the Ark of God and brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 
091Sm 5:2 Then the Philistines took the Ark of God, brought it to the temple of Dagon, and placed it beside Dagon. 
091Sm 5:3 When the people of Ashdod got up the next morning, there was Dagon, lying on the ground in front of the Ark of the Lord. They took Dagon and put him back in his place. 
091Sm 5:4 But when they got up the next morning, there was Dagon, lying on the ground again in front of the Ark of the Lord. Dagon's head and both of his arms were broken off and lying on the threshold. Only the trunk of Dagon was left intact. 
091Sm 5:5 This is why neither the priests of Dagon nor anyone who enters the temple of Dagon step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.2
091Sm 5:6 The Lord heavily oppressed the people of Ashdod, devastating and afflicting Ashdod and its territories with tumors of the groin. 
091Sm 5:7 When the men of Ashdod saw how things were, they said, "Don't let the Ark of the God of Israel stay with us, because he is severely attacking us and our god Dagon." 
091Sm 5:8 They sent messengers and gathered together all the lords of the Philistines and asked, "What shall we do with the Ark of the God of Israel?" They said, "Let the Ark of the God of Israel move to Gath." So they moved the Ark of the God of Israel. 
091Sm 5:9 After they moved it, the Lord moved against the town, causing a very great panic. He struck the men of the town, from young to old with tumors of the groin. 
091Sm 5:10 Then they sent the Ark of God to Ekron. When the Ark of God arrived in Ekron, the people of Ekron cried out, "They have brought the Ark of the God of Israel to us to kill us and our people!"
091Sm 5:11 They sent messengers and gathered together all the Philistine lords£º "Send away the Ark of the God of Israel, and let it return to where it belongs so that it does not kill us and our people." Meanwhile, a deadly panic had spread all over the town, and God kept on pressuring them there. 
091Sm 5:12 The people who did not die were afflicted with tumors of the groin, and the cry of the town went up to heaven.511
091Sm 6:1 The Ark of the Lord remained in Philistine territory for seven months. 
091Sm 6:2 The Philistines summoned the priests and diviners and asked, "What should we do about the Ark of the Lord?Tell us how we should send it back to its place."
091Sm 6:3 They said, "If you send the Ark of the God of Israel back, don't send it empty, but rather be sure to send back to him a guilt offering. Then you will be healed and will know why his oppression has not been removed from you."
091Sm 6:4 They asked, "What is the guilt offering that we should send back to him?" "Five gold tumors and five gold mice," they answered, "according to the number of the lords of the Philistines, since the same plague was on all of you and on your lords. 
091Sm 6:5 Make images of your tumors and images of the mice that are destroying your land, and you are to give glory to the God of Israel. Perhaps he will remove his pressure from you, your gods, and your land. 
091Sm 6:6 Why should you harden your hearts just as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts?Isn't it true that after God toyed with them, they let Israel go, and off they went - 
091Sm 6:7 "So make a new cart, and take two milk cows that have never had a yoke on them. Hitch the cows to the cart and take their calves away from them and back to the house. 
091Sm 6:8 Take the Ark of the Lord, put it on the cart, and put the gold objects that you are returning to him as a guilt offering in a box beside it. Then send it away and let it go. 
091Sm 6:9 Keep watching it. If it goes up along the road to its own territory to Beth-shemesh, it's the Lord who has done this great evil to us. But if it does not, then we will know that he wasn't pressuring us. It happened to us as a natural event."
091Sm 6:10 The men did this. They took two milk cows, hitched them to the cart, and penned up their calves in the house. 
091Sm 6:11 They put the Ark of the Lord, the box, the gold mice, and the images of their tumors on the cart. 
091Sm 6:12 The cows took a straight path along the road to Beth-shemesh. They stayed on the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn to the right or the left. The Philistine lords followed them as far as the border of Beth-shemesh.6
091Sm 6:13 Now the people of Beth-shemesh were gathering their wheat harvest in the valley. They looked up, saw the Ark, and rejoiced to see it. 
091Sm 6:14 The cart came to the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh, and stopped there. In that place there was a large stone. They broke up the wood from the cart, and offered up the cows as a burnt offering to the Lord. 
091Sm 6:15 The Levites took down the Ark of the Lord, along with the box that was with it, containing the objects of gold, and they put them on the large stone. The men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices to the Lord that day. 
091Sm 6:16 When the five Philistine lords saw this, they returned to Ekron that very day. 
091Sm 6:17 These are the gold tumors that the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the Lord£º one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath, and one for Ekron. 
091Sm 6:18 The gold mice represented the number of all the Philistine towns belonging to the five lords, both fortified towns and unwalled villages. The large stone, beside which they put the Ark of the Lord, is a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh. 
091Sm 6:19 God struck down the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the Ark of the Lord. He struck down 50,070 men among the people, and the people mourned because the Lord struck down the people with a great slaughter. 
091Sm 6:20 The men of Beth-shemesh asked themselves, "Who can stand in the presence of the Lord, this holy God?And to whom shall the Ark go up from here?"
091Sm 6:21 They sent messengers to the residents of Kiriath-jearim, who told them, "The Philistines have returned the Ark of the Lord. Come down and take it up with you." 
091Sm 7:1 The men of Kiriath-jearim came and took the Ark of the Lord. They brought it to the house of Abinadab on the hill, and they consecrated his son Eleazar to care for the Ark of the Lord. 
091Sm 7:2 A long time passed - it was twenty years - from the time the Ark came to reside in Kiriath-jearim, and all the house of Israel mourned because of the Lord. 
091Sm 7:3 Then Samuel said to the whole house of Israel, "If you return to the Lord with all your heart, remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth from among you, direct your hearts back to the Lord, and serve him only. Then he will deliver you from the control of the Philistines." 
091Sm 7:4 So the Israelites removed the Baals and Ashtaroth, and served the Lord only. 
091Sm 7:5 Samuel said, "Bring all Israel together at Mizpah, and I'll pray to the Lord on your behalf." 
091Sm 7:6 So they came together at Mizpah, drew water, and poured it out in the Lord's presence. On that day they fasted there and said, "We have sinned against the Lord." Then Samuel judged the Israelites at Mizpah. 
091Sm 7:7 When the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the Philistine lords came up against Israel. When the Israelites heard this, they were afraid of the Philistines. 
091Sm 7:8 The Israelites said to Samuel, "Don't stop crying out to the Lord our God for us that he may deliver us from the hand of the Philistines." 
091Sm 7:9 Then Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the Lord. Samuel cried out to the Lord on behalf of Israel, and the Lord answered him. 
091Sm 7:10 While Samuel was sacrificing the burnt offering, the Philistines approached to attack Israel. But that day the Lord thundered against the Philistines and threw them into panic, and they were defeated before Israel. 
091Sm 7:11 The men of Israel went out from Mizpah, pursued the Philistines, and struck them down as far as to a point below Beth-car. 
091Sm 7:12 Then Samuel took a stone, placed it between Mizpah and Shen and named it Ebenezer. He said, "The Lord has helped us this far." 
091Sm 7:13 The Philistines were subdued, and they did not continue to enter the territory of Israel. The Lord continued to oppose the Philistines all during Samuel's life time. 
091Sm 7:14 The towns that the Philistines had taken from Israel were returned to Israel, from Ekron to Gath, and Israel delivered their territory from Philistine control. There was also peace between Israel and the Amorites. 
091Sm 7:15 Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 
091Sm 7:16 He went on a circuit each year to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all those places. 
091Sm 7:17 He would return to Ramah because his house was there, and judged Israel from there. He also built an altar to the Lord there.7
091Sm 8:1 When Samuel became old, he appointed his sons judges over Israel. 
091Sm 8:2 The name of his firstborn son was Joel and the name of his second was Abijah. They were judges in Beersheba. 
091Sm 8:3 His sons did not follow Samuel's example. Instead, they pursued dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice. 
091Sm 8:4 All the elders of Israel gathered together, and came to Samuel at Ramah. 
091Sm 8:5 They said to him, "Look, you're old, and your sons don't follow your example. So appoint a king to govern us like all the other nations." 
091Sm 8:6 Samuel was displeased when they said, "Give us a king to govern us." So Samuel prayed to the Lord.
091Sm 8:7 The Lord said to Samuel, "Listen to the people in all that they say to you. In fact, it's not you they have rejected, but rather they have rejected me from being their king. 
091Sm 8:8 Like all the things they have done from the day I brought them up out of Egypt until this very day, they have forsaken me and followed other gods. They're also doing the same thing to you. 
091Sm 8:9 Now, listen to them, but you are to clearly warn them and inform them about how the king who rules over them will operate." 
091Sm 8:10 Samuel reported everything the Lord told him to the people who were asking him for a king. 
091Sm 8:11 He said, "This is how the king who rules over you will operate£º He will conscript your sons and assign them to his chariots. He will conscript them as his horsemen, and they'll run in front of his chariots. 
091Sm 8:12 He will appoint his officers over thousands and officers over fifties - some will plow his fields, reap his harvest, and craft his war implements and equipment for his chariots. 
091Sm 8:13 He will take your daughters for perfumers, cooks, and bakers. 
091Sm 8:14 He will take the best products of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves and give them to his servants. 
091Sm 8:15 He will take a tenth of your seed and your vineyards and give it to his officers and servants. 
091Sm 8:16 He will take your male and female servants, your best young men, and your donkeys to do his work. 
091Sm 8:17 He will take a tenth of your flock, and you will become his servants. 
091Sm 8:18 When all of this comes about, you will cry out because of your king whom you chose for yourselves, but the Lord won't answer you at that time." 
091Sm 8:19 The people refused to listen to Samuel. Instead, they insisted, "No! Let a king rule over us instead! 
091Sm 8:20 We, too, will be like all the nations! Our king will govern us and go out before us to fight our battles."
091Sm 8:21 So Samuel listened to all the words of the people, and he repeated them directly to the Lord. 
091Sm 8:22 The Lord said to Samuel, "Listen to them, and appoint a king for them." Then Samuel said to the men of Israel, "Each of you go to his own town."
091Sm 9:1 There was a man from Benjamin named Kish, Abiel's son, the grandson of Zeror and great-grandson of Aphiah's son Becorath. A prominent man from Benjamin, 
091Sm 9:2 he had a son named Saul, who was a choice and handsome young man. There was no one among the Israelites as handsome as he, and he was a head taller than any of the other people.
091Sm 9:3 The donkeys belonging to Kish, Saul's father, were lost, and Kish said to his son Saul, "Take one of the young men with you, get up, and go look for the donkeys." 
091Sm 9:4 He went through the hill country of Ephraim and through the region of Shalishah, but they did not find them. Then they went through the region of Shaalim, but they were not there. They also went through the territory of the Benjaminites, but they did not find them.
091Sm 9:5 When they entered the region of Zuph, Saul said to the young man with him, "Come on, let's go back so my father does not stop worrying about the donkeys and become anxious about us."
091Sm 9:6 The young man said, "Look, there's a man of God in this town. The man is respected, and everything he predicts happens. Now, let's go there. Perhaps he can tell us about the journey on which we have set out." 
091Sm 9:7 Saul said to the young man, "Look, we could go, but what could we bring the man?The bread is gone from our bags, and there is no present to bring to the man of God. What do we have with us?"
091Sm 9:8 The young man answered Saul again, "Look here! I have in my hand a quarter shekel of silver. I'll give it to the man of God, and he will tell us about our journey."
091Sm 9:9 (Previously in Israel, a person would say when he went to inquire of God, "Come on! Let's go to the seer!" because the person known as a prophet today was formerly called a seer.)
091Sm 9:10 Saul said to his young man, "That's a good suggestion! Come on, let's go!" Then they entered the town where the man of God was.
091Sm 9:11 As they were going up the hill to the town, they met some young women going out to draw water, and they said to them, "Is the seer here?"
091Sm 9:12 They answered them£º "Yes, he's right there ahead of you. Hurry, for he came to town just today because there is a sacrifice for the people on the high place today. 
091Sm 9:13 When you come into town you can find him before he goes up to the high place to eat. For the people don't eat until he arrives, because he must bless the sacrifice and then after that those who are invited will eat. So go up right now because you can find him now." 
091Sm 9:14 They went up to the town, and as they were coming to the center of the town, Samuel was coming out to meet them, on his way up to the high place. 
091Sm 9:15 Now one day before Saul's arrival, the Lord had revealed to Samuel£º 
091Sm 9:16 "About this time tomorrow I'll send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you are to anoint him as commander-in-chief over my people Israel. He'll deliver my people from the control of the Philistines, because I've seen the suffering of my people and because their cry has come up to me." 
091Sm 9:17 When Samuel saw Saul, the Lord told him, "Here is the man I told you about. This man will rule over my people."
091Sm 9:18 As Saul approached Samuel in the middle of the gate, he said, "Please tell me where the seer's house is."
091Sm 9:19 Samuel answered Saul£º "I'm the seer. Go up ahead of me to the high place, and eat with me today. In the morning I'll send you away and tell you everything that is on your mind. 
091Sm 9:20 Now as for your donkeys that were lost three days ago, don't give any thought to them, because they've been found. Meanwhile, to whom is all Israel looking, if not to you and all of your father's household?"
091Sm 9:21 Saul answered£º "Am I not a Benjaminite from the least of the tribes of Israel?Isn't my family the least important of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin?Why have you spoken to me like this?" 
091Sm 9:22 Then Samuel took Saul and his young man and brought them to a room where he gave them a place at the head of those who were invited, of whom there were about 30 men. 
091Sm 9:23 Then Samuel said to the cook, "Bring the portion that I gave you, the one I told you to set aside." 
091Sm 9:24 The cook picked up the thigh and what was on it and set it in front of Saul. Then Samuel said, "Here is what is left! Set it before you and eat, for it has been kept for you until the appointed time, about which I said, 'I've invited the people.'" So Saul ate with Samuel that day.
091Sm 9:25 When they had come down from the high place into town, Samuel spoke to Saul on the roof. 
091Sm 9:26 They got up early in the morning, and about daybreak Samuel called to Saul on the roof, "Get up and I'll send you off." Saul got up and the two of them, he and Samuel, went outside. 
091Sm 9:27 As they were going down to the edge of the town, Samuel said to Saul, "Tell your young man to go ahead of us and when he has gone ahead, stop for a while so I may declare God's word to you." 
091Sm 10:1 Samuel took a flask of oil, poured it on Saul's head, kissed him, and said, "The Lord has anointed you commander-in-chief over his inheritance, has he not?
091Sm 10:2 When you leave me today, you will find two men by Rachel's tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah. They'll tell you, 'The donkeys you went to look for have been found. Now your father has stopped worrying about the donkeys and he's anxious about you. He's asking, 'What shall I do about my son?'
091Sm 10:3 Then you'll go on further from there and come to the oak at Tabor. There three men going up to the Lord at Bethel will meet you. One will be herding three young goats, one will be carrying three loaves of bread, and one will be carrying a bottle of wine. 
091Sm 10:4 They'll greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you're to accept from them.
091Sm 10:5 "After that you will come to Gibeath-elohim where the Philistine garrison is. As you arrive there at the town, you'll meet a band of prophets coming down from the high place with a harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre being played in front of them, and they'll be prophesying. 
091Sm 10:6 The Spirit of the Lord will come upon you, and you'll prophesy with them and be changed into a different person. 
091Sm 10:7 When these signs occur, do whatever you want to do, because the Lord is with you. 
091Sm 10:8 You are to go down ahead of me to Gilgal, and then I'll come down to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. You are to wait seven days until I come to you to let you know what you are to do."
091Sm 10:9 Now it happened as Saul turned his back to leave Samuel, that God gave him another heart, and all these signs occurred on that day. 
091Sm 10:10 When they arrived there at Gibeah, a band of prophets was right there to meet them. The Spirit of God came upon Saul, and he prophesied along with them. 
091Sm 10:11 When all those who had known Saul previously saw that he was there among the prophets prophesying, the people said to one another, "What has happened to Kish's son?Is Saul also among the prophets?"10
091Sm 10:12 A man from there answered£º "Now who is their father?" Therefore it became a proverb, "Is Saul also among the prophets?" 
091Sm 10:13 When he had finished prophesying, he went to the high place. 
091Sm 10:14 Saul's uncle said to him and to his young man, "Where did you go?" He said, "To look for the donkeys, and when we saw that they couldn't be found, we went to Samuel."
091Sm 10:15 Then Saul's uncle said, "Please tell me what Samuel said to you."
091Sm 10:16 Saul said to his uncle, "He actually told us that the donkeys had been found," but he did not tell him about the matter of kingship about which Samuel had spoken. 
091Sm 10:17 Samuel summoned the people to the Lord at Mizpah. 
091Sm 10:18 He said to the Israelites, "This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'I brought Israel up out of Egypt, and I rescued you from the power of Egypt and from the power of all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.' 
091Sm 10:19 But today you have rejected your God who delivers you from all your troubles and difficulties. You have said, 'No! Instead, appoint a king over us.' Now present yourselves in the Lord's presence by your tribes and clans." 
091Sm 10:20 Samuel brought forward all the tribes of Israel, and the tribe of Benjamin was chosen. 
091Sm 10:21 Then he brought forward the tribe of Benjamin according to its families, and the family of the Matrites was chosen. Finally, Kish's son Saul was chosen, but when they looked for him, they couldn't find him. 
091Sm 10:22 So they inquired further of the Lord, "Has the man come here yet?" The Lord said, "He is here, hiding among the baggage." 
091Sm 10:23 They ran and brought him from there. When he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the others by a head. 
091Sm 10:24 Then Samuel said to all the people, "Do you see the man whom the Lord has chosen?For there is no one like him among all the people." Then all the people shouted, "Long live the king!" 
091Sm 10:25 Samuel explained to the people the regulations concerning kingship. He wrote them in a scroll and placed it in the Lord's presence. Then Samuel sent all the people to their own houses. 
091Sm 10:26 Saul also went to his house in Gibeah, and the soldiers whose hearts God had touched went with him. 
091Sm 10:27 But some troublemakers said, "How can this man deliver us?" They despised him and did not bring him a gift. But Saul remained silent.
091Sm 10:28 Meanwhile, Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had been severely oppressing the Gadites and Reubenites, gouging out their right eyes and not allowing Israel to have a deliverer. No one was left among the Israelites across the Jordan whose right eye Nahash, king of the Ammonites, had not gouged out. However, 7,000 men had escaped from the Ammonites and entered Jabesh-gilead. 
091Sm 11:1 Soafteramonth, Nahash the Ammonite came up and laid siege to Jabesh-gilead. All the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, "Make a covenant with us, and we will serve you."
091Sm 11:2 Nahash the Ammonite said to them, "I'll make a covenant with you on the condition that I gouge out the right eye of every one of you and so bring disgrace on all Israel."
091Sm 11:3 The elders of Jabesh said to him, "Leave us alone for seven days so that we may send messengers through all the territory of Israel. Then if no one delivers us, we will come out to you and surrender." 
091Sm 11:4 When the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and reported the terms to the people, all the people cried loudly.
091Sm 11:5 Just then Saul was coming in from the field behind the oxen and he said, "What's with the people?Why are they crying?" They reported to him what the men of Jabesh had said.11
091Sm 11:6 When Saul heard these words, the Spirit of God came on him, and he was very angry. 
091Sm 11:7 He took a yoke of oxen, cut them in pieces, and sent the pieces by messengers through all the territory of Israel£º "This is what will be done to the oxen of anyone who does not come out and join Saul and Samuel!" The fear of the Lord fell on the people and they came out as one man. 
091Sm 11:8 Saul mustered them at Bezek, and there were 300,000 Israelites and 30,000 men of Judah. 
091Sm 11:9 They told the messengers who had come, "You are to say this to the men of Jabesh-gilead, 'Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will be delivered.'" The messengers went and reported to the men of Jabesh, and they rejoiced.
091Sm 11:10 The men of Jabesh said, "Tomorrow we will come out to you and surrender. Then you can do whatever you want to us." 
091Sm 11:11 The next day Saul separated the people into three companies. They came into the camp during the morning watch, and struck down the Ammonites until the heat of the day. Those who survived were scattered so that no two of them remained together. 
091Sm 11:12 The people said to Samuel, "Who said, 'Shall Saul reign over us?' Bring them to us and we will put them to death!"
091Sm 11:13 But Saul said, "Let no one be put to death this day, because today the Lord has delivered Israel." 
091Sm 11:14 Then Samuel said to the people, "Come, let's go to Gilgal and reaffirm the kingship there." 15So all the people went to Gilgal and there they made Saul king in the Lord's presence in Gilgal. There they sacrificed peace offerings in the Lord's presence, and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly. 
091Sm 12:1 Then Samuel said to all Israel, "Take note! I've listened to you, to everything you have said to me, and I've appointed a king over you. 
091Sm 12:2 Now here is the king walking before you, while I'm old and gray, and my sons are with you. I've walked before you from my youth until this day. 
091Sm 12:3 Here I am. Testify against me in the Lord's presence and before his anointed. Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken?Who have I cheated?Who have I oppressed?Who bribed me to look the other way?I'll restore it to you."
091Sm 12:4 They said, "You haven't cheated us or oppressed us, and you haven't taken anything from anyone's hand."
091Sm 12:5 He said to them, "Today the Lord is testifying, along with his anointed, that you haven't found any bribes in my possession." They said, "He's a witness." 
091Sm 12:6 Then Samuel said to the people, "It is the Lord who appointed Moses and Aaron and who brought your ancestors up out of the land of Egypt. 
091Sm 12:7 Now stand up and I'll pass judgment on you in light of the Lord's righteous acts that he did for you and your ancestors. 
091Sm 12:8 After Jacob went to Egypt, and your ancestors cried out to the Lord, he sent Moses and Aaron, who brought your ancestors out of Egypt and settled them in this place. 
091Sm 12:9 But they forgot the Lord their God, so he handed them over to the domination of Sisera, the commander of the army of Hazor, and into domination by the Philistines and by the king of Moab, and Israel fought against them.
091Sm 12:10 "Then they cried out to the Lord£º 'We have sinned because we have forsaken the Lord and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. Now deliver us from the hand of our enemies, and we will serve you.' 
091Sm 12:11 Then the Lord sent Jerubbaal, Barak, Jephthah, and Samuel and he delivered you from the hand of your enemies on every side, so that you lived securely. 
091Sm 12:12 But when you saw that Nahash, king of the Ammonites, was coming to fight you, you said to me, 'No, let a king rule over us instead,' even though the Lord your God was your king.11 
091Sm 12:13 "Now, here is the king you have chosen, the one whom you asked for. See, the Lord has appointed a king over you. 
091Sm 12:14 If you fear the Lord, serve him, obey him, and don't rebel against the commandment of the Lord, then both you and the king who rules over you will truly follow the Lord your God. 
091Sm 12:15 But if you don't obey the Lord and rebel against the commandment of the Lord, then the Lord will turn against you as he did against your ancestors.1214
091Sm 12:16 "Now then, stand up and see this great thing that the Lord is about to do before your eyes. 
091Sm 12:17 Is it not the wheat harvest today?I'll call upon the Lord, and he will send thunder and rain. Then you will know and understand that you have done a great evil in the sight of the Lord by asking for a king for yourselves." 
091Sm 12:18 Samuel called upon the Lord that same day, and the Lord sent thunder and rain. So all the people greatly feared the Lord and Samuel. 
091Sm 12:19 Then all the people said to Samuel, "Pray to the Lord your God for your servants, so that we don't die, because we made all our sins worse by asking for a king for ourselves."
091Sm 12:20 Samuel said to all the people, "Don't be afraid. You have done all this evil. Yet don't turn aside from following the Lord, but serve the Lord with all your heart. 
091Sm 12:21 Don't turn aside after useless things that cannot profit or deliver because they're useless. 
091Sm 12:22 Indeed, the Lord won't abandon His people for the sake of His great name, for the Lord desires to make you a people for himself. 
091Sm 12:23 Now as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the Lord by ceasing to pray for you. I'll also instruct you in the way that is good and right. 
091Sm 12:24 Only, fear the Lord and serve him faithfully with all your heart. Indeed, consider what great things he has done for you. 
091Sm 12:25 But if you persist in doing evil, both you and your king will be swept away."12
091Sm 13:1 Saul was 30 years old when he began to reign, and he ruled for 42 years over Israel. 
091Sm 13:2 Saul chose for himself 3,000 men from Israel. There were 2,000 with Saul in Michmash and the hill country of Bethel, while 1,000 were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin. He had sent the rest of the people home. 
091Sm 13:3 Jonathan attacked the Philistine garrison in Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land£º "Listen, Hebrews!" 
091Sm 13:4 All Israel heard the report, "Saul has attacked the Philistine garrison and Israel has also become repulsive to the Philistines." Then the people were summoned to Saul at Gilgal.
091Sm 13:5 The Philistines assembled to fight against Israel with 30,000 chariots, 6,000 horsemen, and people as numerous as the sand on the seashore. And they advanced and camped in Michmash, east of Beth-aven. 
091Sm 13:6 When the men of Israel saw that they were in distress (for the people were in a tight spot), the people hid themselves in caves, in thickets, in crags, in tombs, and in pits. 
091Sm 13:7 Hebrews went across the Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead, but Saul remained in Gilgal, and all the people followed him trembling. 
091Sm 13:8 Saul waited seven days for the appointment set by Samuel. When Samuel did not arrive at Gilgal, as the people began to scatter from Saul, 
091Sm 13:9 Saul said, "Bring the burnt offering and the peace offering to me," and he offered the burnt offering. 
091Sm 13:10 Just as he finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel arrived, and Saul went out to meet and greet him.
091Sm 13:11 Samuel said, "What have you done?" Saul replied, "When?I saw that the people were scattering from me, that you didn't come at the appointed time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash. 
091Sm 13:12 I thought, 'The Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal but I've not sought the favor of the Lord,' so I forced myself to offer the burnt offering." 
091Sm 13:13 Then Samuel said to Saul, "You have acted foolishly. You haven't obeyed the commandment of the Lord your God, which he commanded you. For then the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever, 
091Sm 13:14 but now your kingdom won't be established. The Lord has sought for himself a man after his own heart, and the Lord has appointed him as commander-in-chief over his people because you didn't obey that which the Lord commanded you." 
091Sm 13:15 Then Samuel got up and went from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. Saul mustered the people present with him, about 600 men. 
091Sm 13:16 Saul, his son Jonathan, and the people present with them remained in Geba of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped in Michmash. 
091Sm 13:17 Raiders went out of the Philistine camp in three companies. One company turned in the direction of Ophrah, to the land of Shual, 
091Sm 13:18 one company turned in the direction of Beth-horon, while the one company turned toward the border that overlooks the valley of Zeboiim toward the desert.1316
091Sm 13:19 No blacksmith could be found in all the land of Israel because the Philistines thought, "This will keep the Hebrews from making swords or spears." 
091Sm 13:20 All Israel would have to go to the Philistines so each person could sharpen his plow, his mattock, his axe, and his sickle. 
091Sm 13:21 The charge was two thirds of a shekel for plows, mattocks, three pronged forks, and axes, or for setting the goads. 
091Sm 13:22 On the day of battle no sword or spear was found in the hands of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan, but Saul and his son Jonathan did have them. 
091Sm 13:23 Now a garrison of the Philistines had gone out to the pass of Michmash. 
091Sm 14:1 One day Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "Come, let's go over to the Philistine garrison which is on the other side," but he did not tell his father. 
091Sm 14:2 Saul was sitting on the outskirts of Geba under the pomegranate tree which was at Migron, and with him were about 600 men. 
091Sm 14:3 Along with him were Ahitub's son Ahijah, Ichabod's brother, who was Phineas' son and a grandson of Eli the priest of the Lord at Shiloh, who was carrying the ephod. The people did not know that Jonathan had gone.1
091Sm 14:4 Now in the pass through which Jonathan planned to get across to the Philistine garrison, there was a sharp crag on one side and a sharp crag on the other side. The name of the one was Bozez, and the name of the other was Seneh. 
091Sm 14:5 One crag rose on the north opposite Michmash, and the other on the south opposite Geba. 
091Sm 14:6 Jonathan said to his armor bearer, "Come, let's go over to the garrison of these uncircumcised ones. Perhaps the Lord will work for us, since nothing prevents the Lord from delivering, whether by many or by a few."
091Sm 14:7 His armor bearer said to him, "Do whatever you want. Let's move out! I'm right here with you, as you wish."
091Sm 14:8 Jonathan said, "Look, we're going over to the men, and we will show ourselves to them. 
091Sm 14:9 If they say to us, 'Stay there until we come to you,' then we will stay where we are and not go up to them. 
091Sm 14:10 But if they say, 'Come up and fight us,' then we will go up, for the Lord has given them into our hands, and this will be the sign for us."
091Sm 14:11 When the two of them showed themselves to the Philistine garrison, the Philistines said, "Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have been hiding."
091Sm 14:12 The men of the garrison responded to Jonathan and his armor bearer£º "Come up and fight us, and we will show you something." Jonathan then said to his armor bearer, "Follow me, for the Lord has given them into Israel's control." 
091Sm 14:13 Jonathan crawled up on his hands and feet, with his armor bearer following him. The Philistines fell before Jonathan, and his armor bearer who was behind him also killed some. 
091Sm 14:14 In the initial attack, Jonathan and his armor bearer struck down about twenty men in an area of about half an acre of land. 
091Sm 14:15 There was terror in the camp, in the field, and among all the people. Even the garrison and the raiders were terrified. The earth shook, and there was even greater terror. 
091Sm 14:16 Saul's sentries in Gibeah of Benjamin watched as the camp was in disarray, going this way and that. 
091Sm 14:17 Saul said to the people who were with him, "Do a roll call and see who has left us." They did a roll call, and Jonathan and his armor bearer were not there. 
091Sm 14:18 Saul said to Ahijah, "Bring the Ark of God here." For at that time the Ark of God was with the Israelites.
091Sm 14:19 While Saul was still speaking to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp increased more and more, and Saul said to the priest, "Remove your hand." 
091Sm 14:20 Then Saul and all the people who were with him assembled and went into battle. Now the swords of all the Philistines were against each other, and there was very great confusion. 
091Sm 14:21 The Hebrews who had previously been with the Philistines, who had gone up with them from the surrounding areas to the camp, even they joined Israel and those who were with Saul and Jonathan. 
091Sm 14:22 All the Israelites who had been hiding in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines were fleeing, and even they pursued the Philistines in the battle. 
091Sm 14:23 On that day the Lord delivered Israel, and the battle moved past Beth-aven. 
091Sm 14:24 The men of Israel were hard pressed on that day, and Saul required the army to take an oath£º "Cursed is the person who eats food before evening and before I've been avenged of my enemies." So no one tasted food.
091Sm 14:25 Later on, all the soldiers entered the woods, and there was honey on the ground. 
091Sm 14:26 The people came into the woods and there was flowing honey, but no one put his hand to his mouth to eat it because the people were afraid due to the oath. 
091Sm 14:27 But Jonathan had not heard that his father had required the army to swear an oath, so he stretched out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it in the honeycomb. He brought it back to his mouth and his eyes brightened. 
091Sm 14:28 Then one of the people responded£º "Your father strictly ordered the army to take an oath. That's why he said, 'Cursed is the person who eats food today,' and so the army is exhausted."
091Sm 14:29 Jonathan said, "My father has troubled the land. See how my eyes have brightened because I tasted a little of this honey. 
091Sm 14:30 How much better if the army had eaten freely today of their enemy's spoil that they found, because the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great."
091Sm 14:31 That day they struck down the Philistines from Michmash to Aijalon, and the army was very weary. 
091Sm 14:32 The army grabbed the spoil, took sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground, and then the army ate them with the blood. 
091Sm 14:33 Someone reported this to Saul£º "Right now the army is sinning against the Lord by eating meat with the blood." He said, "You have acted treacherously. Roll a large stone to me today."31
091Sm 14:34 Then Saul said, "Disperse yourselves among the soldiers and say to them, 'Let each man bring his ox and his sheep to me, and you are to slaughter them here and eat. But don't sin against the Lord by eating meat with the blood.'" So every soldier brought his ox with him that night, and they slaughtered them there. 
091Sm 14:35 Saul built an altar to the Lord; it was the first altar that he built to the Lord. 
091Sm 14:36 Saul said, "Let's go down after the Philistines tonight and plunder them until dawn, and let's not leave a single one of them alive." They said, "Do whatever seems good to you!" But the priest said, "Let's draw near to God here."
091Sm 14:37 Saul inquired of God, "Shall I go down after the Philistines?Will you give them into the hand of Israel?" But God did not answer him that day. 
091Sm 14:38 Saul said, "All you army officers are to come here to find out what constitutes this sin today. 
091Sm 14:39 Indeed, as the Lord who delivers Israel lives, even if the sin is with my son Jonathan, he shall surely die!" Not a single one of the soldiers answered him. 
091Sm 14:40 Then he said to all Israel, "You will be on one side, and I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side."39 The people said to Saul, "Do what seems good to you."9
091Sm 14:41 Then Saul said to the Lord God of Israel, "Judge us properly." Jonathan and Saul were selected, but the army was cleared. 
091Sm 14:42 Saul said, "Cast lots between me and my son Jonathan," and Jonathan was selected. 
091Sm 14:43 Saul said to Jonathan, "Tell me what you've done." So Jonathan spoke to him£º "I did taste a little honey from the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am; I'm ready to die!"
091Sm 14:44 Saul said, "May God do this to me and even more, if you don't surely die, Jonathan!"
091Sm 14:45 Then the army said to Saul, "Shall Jonathan die, who brought about this great deliverance in Israel?As the Lord lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, because today he did this with God's help."
091Sm 14:46 Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went back to their territory.
091Sm 14:47 When Saul became king over Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side - against Moab, the Ammonites, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Everywhere he turned he was victorious. 
091Sm 14:48 He acted valiantly, defeated Amalek, and delivered Israel from those who had been plundering them.
091Sm 14:49 Saul's sons included Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua. Of his two daughters, the firstborn was named Merab, and the younger one was named Michal. 
091Sm 14:50 Saul's wife was Ahinoam, daughter of Ahimaaz, while the commander of his army was Saul's uncle Ner's son Abner. 
091Sm 14:51 Saul's father Kish and Abner's father Ner were sons of Abiel. 
091Sm 14:52 There was intense fighting against the Philistines during Saul's entire reign, and whenever Saul discovered a strong or valiant warrior, he would enlist him for service.
091Sm 15:1 Samuel said to Saul, "The Lord sent me to anoint you king over his people, Israel. Now listen to the words of the Lord. 
091Sm 15:2 This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'I'll punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, when he set himself against Israel in the way, as they were going up from Egypt. 
091Sm 15:3 Now, go and attack Amalek. Completely destroy all that they have. Don't spare them, but put to death both man and woman, child and infant, both ox and sheep, camel and donkey.'"
091Sm 15:4 Saul summoned the people and mustered them in Telaim, 200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men from Judah. 
091Sm 15:5 Saul came to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the valley. 
091Sm 15:6 Saul said to the Kenites, "Withdraw from the Amalekites so that I don't destroy you with them, for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they departed from Egypt." So the Kenites withdrew from the Amalekites. 
091Sm 15:7 Saul attacked the Amalekites from Havilah to Shur, which is east of Egypt. 
091Sm 15:8 He captured alive Agag king of Amalek, but he completely destroyed all the people, executing them with swords. 
091Sm 15:9 Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep and cattle - the fattened animals and lambs - along with all that was good. They were not willing to completely destroy them, but they did completely destroy everything that was worthless and inferior.
091Sm 15:10 The word of the Lord came to Samuel£º 
091Sm 15:11 "I regret that I made Saul king, because he has turned away from following me and has not carried out my commands." Samuel was angry, and he cried out to the Lord all night.
091Sm 15:12 Samuel got up early in the morning to meet Saul, but Samuel was told, "Saul went up to Carmel to set up a monument for himself. Then he turned around and traveled on to Gilgal."
091Sm 15:13 Samuel approached Saul. "May the Lord bless you," Saul said. "I've carried out the Lord's command."
091Sm 15:14 Samuel said, "Then what is this bleating of sheep in my ears and the lowing of cattle that I hear?"
091Sm 15:15 Saul replied, "They brought them from the Amalekites. The people spared the best of the sheep and cattle to offer sacrifices to the Lord your God, and the rest they completely destroyed."
091Sm 15:16 "Be quiet!" Samuel said. "I'll tell you what the Lord told me last night." Saul said to him, "Speak." 
091Sm 15:17 So Samuel replied, "Is it not true that though you were small in your own eyes you became head of the tribes of Israel, and the Lord anointed you king over Israel?
091Sm 15:18 The Lord sent you on a mission£º 'Go and completely destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they're destroyed.' 
091Sm 15:19 Why didn't you obey the Lord, but grabbed the spoil and did evil in the Lord's sight?" 
091Sm 15:20 Saul said to Samuel, "I did obey the Lord. I went on the mission on which the Lord sent me, I brought Agag king of Amalek, and I completely destroyed the Amalekites. 
091Sm 15:21 The people took some of the spoil - sheep, cattle, and the best of what was to be completely destroyed - to sacrifice to the Lord your God at Gilgal." 
091Sm 15:22 Samuel said, "Does the Lord delight as much in burnt offerings and sacrifices as in obeying the Lord?Surely, to obey is better than sacrifice, to pay attention is better than the fat of rams. 
091Sm 15:23 Indeed, rebellion is the sin of divination, and arrogance is iniquity and idolatry. Because you have rejected the word of the Lord, he has rejected you from being king." 
091Sm 15:24 "I've sinned," Saul replied to Samuel. "I've broken the Lord's command and your word, because I was afraid of the people and listened to them. 
091Sm 15:25 Now, please forgive my sin and return with me so I may worship the Lord."
091Sm 15:26 Samuel said to Saul, "I won't return with you because you have rejected the word of the Lord, and the Lord has rejected you from being king over Israel."15
091Sm 15:27 As Samuel turned to go Saul seized him by the corner of his robe, and it tore. 
091Sm 15:28 Samuel said to him, "The Lord has torn the kingdom of Israel away from you today, and he has given it to your neighbor who is better than you. 
091Sm 15:29 Moreover, the Glory of Israel does not lie or change his mind, for he's not a man that he should change his mind."
091Sm 15:30 "I've sinned," Saul said. "But please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and return with me so I may worship the Lord your God." 
091Sm 15:31 Samuel returned, following Saul, and Saul worshipped the Lord.
091Sm 15:32 Then Samuel said, "Bring Agag king of Amalek to me." Agag came to him in fetters, saying to himself, "Surely the bitterness of death is past."
091Sm 15:33 Samuel said, "Just as your sword has made women childless, so your mother will be childless among women." Then Samuel cut Agag into pieces in the Lord's presence in Gilgal. 
091Sm 15:34 Then Samuel went to Ramah, and Saul went to his house in Gibeah of Saul. 
091Sm 15:35 Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, but Samuel grieved over Saul, and the Lord regretted that he had made Saul king over Israel. 
091Sm 16:1 The Lord said to Samuel, "How long will you grieve over Saul, since I've rejected him from being king over Israel?Fill your horn with oil and go. I'm sending you to Jesse from Bethlehem because I've chosen for myself one of his sons as king."
091Sm 16:2 Samuel said, "How can I go?Saul will hear about this and kill me!" The Lord said, "Take a heifer with you and say, 'I've come to offer a sacrifice to the Lord.' 
091Sm 16:3 You are to invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I'll show you what you are to do. You are to anoint for me the one I tell you."
091Sm 16:4 Samuel did what the Lord said and went to Bethlehem. The elders of the town came out to meet him trembling, and said, "May your coming be in peace."
091Sm 16:5 He said, "Peace, I've come to sacrifice to the Lord. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice." Samuel consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice. 
091Sm 16:6 When they arrived, Samuel saw Eliab, and said, "Surely he's the Lord's anointed."
091Sm 16:7 The Lord said to Samuel, "Don't look at his appearance or his height, for I've rejected him. Truly, God does not see what man sees, for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord sees the heart." 
091Sm 16:8 Then Jesse summoned Abinadab and brought him before Samuel, and he said, "Neither has the Lord chosen this one." 
091Sm 16:9 Then Jesse brought Shammah, and he said, "Neither has the Lord chosen this one." 
091Sm 16:10 Jesse brought seven of his sons before Samuel, and Samuel said to Jesse, "The Lord has not chosen these." 
091Sm 16:11 Then Samuel said to Jesse, "Are these all the young men?" He said, "There yet remains the youngest one, and right now he's tending the sheep." Samuel said to Jesse, "Send someone to get him, for we won't do anything else until he arrives here." 
091Sm 16:12 So he sent and brought him. He had a dark, healthy complexion, with beautiful eyes, and he was handsome. The Lord said, "Get up and anoint him, for this is the one." 
091Sm 16:13 Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed David in the presence of his brothers, and the Spirit of the Lord came on David from that day forward. Then Samuel got up and went to Ramah. 
091Sm 16:14 The Spirit of the Lord departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord troubled him. 
091Sm 16:15 Saul's servants said to him, "Look, an evil spirit from God is troubling you. 
091Sm 16:16 Let our lord order his servants who attend you to look for a man who is skilled in playing the lyre. And then when an evil spirit from God comes on you, he will play and you will be better."16 
091Sm 16:17 Saul said to his servants, "Find a man for me who can play well and bring him to me."
091Sm 16:18 One of the young men answered£º "Look, I've seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is skilled in playing. The man is a valiant soldier, gifted in speech, and handsome. And the Lord is with him."
091Sm 16:19 So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, "Send me your son David, who is with the sheep."
091Sm 16:20 Jesse took a donkey loaded with bread, a container of wine, and one kid, and sent them to Saul along with his son David. 
091Sm 16:21 David went to Saul and began to serve him. Saul loved him very much, and he became his armor bearer. 
091Sm 16:22 Saul sent a messenger to Jesse to tell him, "Allow David to serve me, because I'm pleased with him." 
091Sm 16:23 Whenever an evil spirit from God came to Saul, David would take the lyre and play it. Relief would come to Saul and he would be better, because the evil spirit would leave him. 
091Sm 17:1 The Philistines assembled their army for battle. They were assembled at Socoh, which belongs to Judah, and they camped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. 
091Sm 17:2 Saul and the Israelites assembled and camped in the valley of Elah, where they set up their forces to meet the Philistines. 
091Sm 17:3 The Philistines were standing on the hill on one side while the Israelites were standing on the hill on the other side, with the valley between them.
091Sm 17:4 A champion named Goliath from Gath came out from the Philistine camp. He was six and a half feet tall, 
091Sm 17:5 wore a bronze helmet on his head, and wore bronze scale armor that weighed about 125 pounds. 
091Sm 17:6 He had bronze armor on his legs and carried a bronze javelin slung between his shoulders. 
091Sm 17:7 The shaft of his spear was like a weaver's beam and the iron point of his spear weighed fifteen pounds. A man carrying his shield walked in front of him.5
091Sm 17:8 He stood still and called out to the ranks of Israel, "Why should you move into position for battle?Am I not a Philistine and you Saul's servants?Choose a man for yourselves to come down against me. 
091Sm 17:9 If he's able to fight me and strike me down, then we will become your servants; but if I prevail against him and strike him down, then you will become our servants and serve us." 
091Sm 17:10 The Philistine said, "I defy the ranks of Israel today. Send me one man and let's fight together." 
091Sm 17:11 When Saul and all the Israelites heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and very frightened. 
091Sm 17:12 David was the son of that Ephrathite man named Jesse from Bethlehem in Judah. He had eight sons; at the time when Saul was king he was old, having lived to an advanced age. 
091Sm 17:13 The three oldest sons of Jesse followed Saul into battle. The names of his three sons who went to the battle were his firstborn Eliab, Abinadab, his second son, and Shammah, the third. 
091Sm 17:14 David was the youngest, while the three oldest had followed Saul. 
091Sm 17:15 And David would go back and forth from Saul to tend his father's sheep in Bethlehem. 
091Sm 17:16 For 40 days the Philistine would come forward, morning and evening, to take his position. 
091Sm 17:17 Jesse said to his son David, "Take for your brothers this half-bushel of roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread and quickly take them to your brothers in the camp. 
091Sm 17:18 Take these ten pieces of cheese to the commander of the unit, check on the well-being of your brothers, and bring something back from them. 
091Sm 17:19 Saul, your brothers, and all the men of Israel are in the valley of Elah fighting with the Philistines." 
091Sm 17:20 David got up early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper, took the supplies, and went as Jesse had directed him. He arrived at the encampment as the army was going out to the battle line, shouting the battle cry. 
091Sm 17:21 Israel and the Philistines moved into position for battle, battle line facing battle line. 
091Sm 17:22 David left the supplies he had with him in the care of the supply keeper and ran to the battle line. When he arrived there, he asked his brothers about their well-being. 
091Sm 17:23 As he was speaking with them, the Philistine champion named Goliath from Gath came up from the Philistine battle lines and spoke his usual words, as David listened. 
091Sm 17:24 When all the Israelites saw the man, they fled from him and were very frightened. 
091Sm 17:25 "Did all of you see this man coming up?" one Israelite asked. "He comes up to defy Israel, and the king will richly reward the man who kills him. He will give his daughter to him and will make his father's house tax free in Israel."
091Sm 17:26 David asked the men who were standing by him, "What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel?Indeed, who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he should defy the armies of the living God?"
091Sm 17:27 The people also told him the same thing, saying, "This is what will be done for the man who kills him." 
091Sm 17:28 Eliab his oldest brother heard him talking to the men. Eliab was angry with David and said, "Why did you come down here?And who did you leave those few sheep with in the wilderness?I know your insolence and wicked intentions. You came down just to see the battle!"
091Sm 17:29 "What have I done now?" David asked?"It was just a question, wasn't it?" 
091Sm 17:30 Then he turned from him toward another person and asked the same thing. The people replied to him the same way as the first one had. 
091Sm 17:31 When the words that David had spoken were heard, they were reported to Saul, and he sent for him. 
091Sm 17:32 David said to Saul, "Let no one's courage fail because of him; your servant will go fight this Philistine."
091Sm 17:33 Saul said to David, "You can't go against this Philistine and fight him. You are only a young man, but he has been a warrior since his youth." 
091Sm 17:34 David said to Saul, "Your servant has been a shepherd for his father. When a lion or bear came and took a lamb from the flock, 
091Sm 17:35 I would go out after it, strike it down, and rescue the lamb from its mouth. Then when it rose up against me, I would grab it by its fur, strike it down, and kill it. 
091Sm 17:36 Your servant has struck down both lions and bears, and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he defied the armies of the living God." 
091Sm 17:37 David continued, "The Lord who delivered me from the power of the lion and the power of the bear will also deliver me from the power of this Philistine." Saul said to David, "Go, and may the Lord be with you."
091Sm 17:38 Saul put his garments on David, set a bronze helmet on his head, and put armor on him. 
091Sm 17:39 David strapped Saul's sword over his garments and tried to walk, but he was not used to the armor. David told Saul, "I can't walk in these because I'm not used to them," and then took them off. 
091Sm 17:40 He took his staff in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones from the brook and put them in the pouch in his shepherd's bag. He approached the Philistine with his sling in his hand. 
091Sm 17:41 With a man carrying his shield in front of him, the Philistine kept coming closer to David. 
091Sm 17:42 When the Philistine looked and saw David, he had contempt for him, because he was only a young man. David had a dark, healthy complexion and was handsome. 
091Sm 17:43 The Philistine asked David, "Am I a dog that you come at me with sticks?" Then the Philistine cursed David by his own gods and 
091Sm 17:44 said to David, "Come to me! I'll give your flesh to the birds of the sky and to the beasts of the field."42 
091Sm 17:45 Then David said to the Philistine, "You come at me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of the armies of Israel whom you have defied. 
091Sm 17:46 This very day the Lord will deliver you into my hand, and I'll strike you down and remove your head from you. And this very day I'll give the dead bodies of the Philistine army to the birds of the sky and to the animals of the earth, so that all the earth will know that there is a God in Israel, 
091Sm 17:47 and this whole congregation will know that the Lord does not deliver by sword or spear. Indeed, the battle is the Lord's and he will give you into our hands."46
091Sm 17:48 When the Philistine got up and came closer to meet David, David quickly ran to the battle line to meet the Philistine. 
091Sm 17:49 David reached his hand into the bag, took out a stone, slung it, and struck the Philistine in his forehead. The stone sunk into his forehead, and he fell on his face to the ground. 
091Sm 17:50 David defeated the Philistine with a sling and a stone; he struck down the Philistine and killed him, and there was no sword in David's hand. 
091Sm 17:51 David ran and stood over the Philistine. He took the Philistine's sword, pulled it from its sheath, killed him, and then he cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. 
091Sm 17:52 The men of Israel and Judah got up with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance to the valley and to the gates of Ekron. Wounded Philistines fell along the way to Shaaraim as far as Gath and Ekron. 
091Sm 17:53 The Israelites returned from pursuing the Philistines and plundered their camp. 
091Sm 17:54 David took the Philistine's head and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put Goliath's weapons in his tent.
091Sm 17:55 When Saul saw David going out to meet the Philistine, he asked Abner, the commander of the army, "Whose son is this young man, Abner?" Abner said, "As surely as you live, your majesty, I don't know."
091Sm 17:56 The king replied, "Go find out whose son the young man is."
091Sm 17:57 When David returned from striking down the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him to Saul with the Philistine's head in his hand. 
091Sm 17:58 Saul said to him, "Whose son are you, young man?" David said, "The son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem." 
091Sm 18:1 When David finished speaking with Saul, Jonathan became a close friend to David, and Jonathan loved him as himself. 
091Sm 18:2 Saul took David that day and did not let him return to his father's house. 
091Sm 18:3 Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as he loved himself. 
091Sm 18:4 Jonathan took off the robe that he had on and gave it to David, along with his coat, his sword, his bow, and his belt. 
091Sm 18:5 David went out and was successful everywhere Saul sent him, and Saul put him in charge of the troops. This pleased both all the people, as well as Saul's officials.
091Sm 18:6 When David returned from defeating the Philistine, as they were entering the city, women from all the towns of Israel came out to meet King Saul, singing and dancing as they joyously played tambourines and lyres. 
091Sm 18:7 As the women sang and played, they said, "Saul has struck down his thousands but David his ten thousands."
091Sm 18:8 Saul was very angry and he did not like what the women sang. He said to himself, "They have attributed tens of thousands to David, but to me they have attributed thousands. What else can he have but the kingdom?" 
091Sm 18:9 From then on Saul kept his eye on David. 
091Sm 18:10 The next day, while David was playing the lyre as he had before, the evil spirit from the Lord attacked Saul, and he began to rave inside the house with a spear in his hand. 
091Sm 18:11 Saul hurled it, thinking, "I'll pin David to the wall." But David escaped from him twice. 
091Sm 18:12 Now Saul was afraid of David because the Lord was with him and had departed from Saul. 
091Sm 18:13 Saul removed David from his presence and made him an officer over a division of soldiers. So David led the troops in battle. 
091Sm 18:14 David was successful in all that he did, for the Lord was with him. 
091Sm 18:15 When Saul saw that David was highly successful, he feared him. 
091Sm 18:16 But all Israel and Judah loved David because he led them in battle. 
091Sm 18:17 Saul said to David, "Here is my older daughter Merab. I'll give her to you as a wife. Just be an excellent soldier for me and fight the Lord's battles." Now Saul said to himself, "I won't harm him myself. Instead, I'll let the Philistines harm him."
091Sm 18:18 David said to Saul, "Who am I and what is my life or my father's family in Israel that I should be the king's son-in-law?" 
091Sm 18:19 And when the time came to give Saul's daughter Merab to David, she was given as a wife to Adriel of Meholah. 
091Sm 18:20 Saul's daughter Michal loved David. Saul was informed of this and he liked the idea. 
091Sm 18:21 Saul said to himself, "I'll give her to him and she can be a snare to him and the Philistines will harm him." So Saul said to David, "For a second time you can be my son-in-law today."18
091Sm 18:22 Saul commanded his officials, "Speak with David privately and say, 'Look, the king delights in you, and all his officials love you. Now become the king's son-in-law.'"18
091Sm 18:23 Saul's officials delivered this message to David, and he asked, "Is becoming the king's son-in-law an unimportant thing to you?I'm a poor and unimportant man."
091Sm 18:24 Saul's officials reported to him£º "This is what David said." 
091Sm 18:25 Saul said, "This is what you are to tell David, 'The king desires no bride price except 100 Philistine foreskins to take vengeance on the king's enemies.'" Now Saul thought he would cause David to die at the hand of the Philistines. 
091Sm 18:26 When his officials delivered this message to David, David decided it would be a good thing to become the king's son-in-law. Before the time was up, 
091Sm 18:27 David got up, went out with his men, and struck down 200 Philistine men. David brought their foreskins and gave them all to the king so he could become the king's son-in-law. So Saul gave him his daughter Michal as a wife. 
091Sm 18:28 As Saul continued to observe, he realized that the Lord was with David and that Saul's daughter Michal loved him. 
091Sm 18:29 Then Saul was even more afraid of David, and Saul was David's enemy from that time on. 
091Sm 18:30 The Philistine commanders would go out to fight and whenever they did, David was more successful than any of Saul's other leaders. His name was held in high esteem. 
091Sm 19:1 Saul told his son Jonathan and all his officials to kill David, but Saul's son Jonathan was very fond of David. 
091Sm 19:2 So Jonathan told David, "My father Saul is trying to kill you. In the morning be careful and stay hidden in a secret place. 
091Sm 19:3 I'll go out and stand by my father in the field where you are. I'll speak to my father about you. If I find out what he intends to do, I'll tell you."
091Sm 19:4 Jonathan spoke to his father Saul favorably about David. "The king shouldn't wrong his servant David because he has not wronged you and because what he has done has been very beneficial for you. 
091Sm 19:5 He risked his life and struck down the Philistine, and the Lord brought about a spectacular deliverance for all Israel. You saw that and rejoiced, so why would you do wrong and shed innocent blood by killing David without cause?" 
091Sm 19:6 Saul listened to Jonathan, and swore by the life of the Lord that David would not be killed. 
091Sm 19:7 Jonathan summoned David and told him all this. Then Jonathan brought David to Saul, and David served him as before.5
091Sm 19:8 The war continued and David went out to fight against the Philistines. He thoroughly defeated them, and they fled before David. 
091Sm 19:9 The evil spirit from the Lord attacked Saul while he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand and David was playing the lyre. 
091Sm 19:10 Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he jumped away from Saul and the spear stuck in the wall. That night David escaped and fled. 
091Sm 19:11 Saul sent messengers to David's house to watch him so they could kill him in the morning. David's wife, Michal, said to him, "If you don't escape with your life tonight, tomorrow you'll be put to death." 
091Sm 19:12 So Michal let David down through the window, and he escaped and fled. 
091Sm 19:13 Then Michal took the household idol and laid it on the bed with a cover of goat hair placed at its head. Then she covered it with clothes. 
091Sm 19:14 When Saul sent the messengers to take David, Michal said, "He's sick."
091Sm 19:15 Then Saul sent messengers to check on David. He told them, "Bring him to me on the bed so I may kill him." 
091Sm 19:16 The messengers went in, and there was the household idol in the bed with the cover of goat hair at its head!19
091Sm 19:17 Then Saul said to Michal, "Why did you deceive me like this and let my enemy go so he could escape?" Michal said to Saul, "He said to me, 'Let me go or I'll kill you!'"
091Sm 19:18 David escaped and fled. He came to Samuel at Ramah and told him all that Saul had done to him. Then he and Samuel went and stayed at Naioth. 
091Sm 19:19 It was reported to Saul saying, "David is at Naioth in Ramah right now." 
091Sm 19:20 Saul sent messengers to take David, and they saw a group of prophets caught up in prophetic ecstasy, with Samuel standing beside them leading them. Then the Spirit of God came on Saul's messengers, and they also were caught up in prophetic ecstasy.19
091Sm 19:21 They reported this to Saul, he sent other messengers, and they also were caught up in prophetic ecstasy. 
091Sm 19:22 Then Saul himself went to Ramah, and he arrived at the large well that is in Secu. He asked, "Where are Samuel and David?" Someone replied, "They're at Naioth in Ramah." 
091Sm 19:23 Saul went to Naioth in Ramah, and the Spirit of God came on him also. He continued in prophetic ecstasy until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 
091Sm 19:24 He also removed his clothes and was caught up in prophetic ecstasy right in front of Samuel! He fell down naked and remained there all that day and all night. That is why people say, "Is Saul also among the prophets?" 
091Sm 20:1 David fled from Naioth in Ramah. He came to Jonathan and said, "What have I done? What is my crime, and how have I wronged your father so that he's determined to kill me? 
091Sm 20:2 Jonathan said to him, "Far from it! You won't die. Look, my father never does anything, great or small, without telling me; so why should my father hide this thing from me? It's not like that!"
091Sm 20:3 David again took an oath£º "Your father certainly knows that I've found favor with you, and so he said to himself, 'Jonathan must not know this so he won't be upset.' But as certainly as the Lord is alive and living, and as certainly as I'm alive and living, too, there is only a step between me and death."
091Sm 20:4 Jonathan said to David, "Whatever you say, I'll do." 
091Sm 20:5 David said to Jonathan, "Look, the new moon is tomorrow, and I'm expected to sit down with the king to eat. Let me go so I can hide in the field until the evening of the day after tomorrow. 
091Sm 20:6 If your father actually notices that I'm not there, then you are to say, 'David urgently requested that I allow him to run to his hometown of Bethlehem because the yearly sacrifice for the entire family was taking place there.' 
091Sm 20:7 If he says, 'Good,' then your servant will be safe. But if he actually gets angry, you will know that his intentions are evil. 
091Sm 20:8 Now, show gracious kindness to your servant because you have entered into a sacred covenant with your servant. If there is iniquity in me, then kill me yourself - why should you bring me to your father?" 
091Sm 20:9 "Nonsense!" Jonathan replied. "If I actually knew that my father intended evil against you, wouldn't I tell you about it?"
091Sm 20:10 Then David said to Jonathan, "Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?"
091Sm 20:11 Then Jonathan said to David, "Come, let's go into the field." So the two of them went into the field. 
091Sm 20:12 Jonathan said to David, "The Lord God of Israel is my witness that I'll carefully question my father by tomorrow or the next day. And if the response is favorable for David, will I not then send word to you and let you know?
091Sm 20:13 But if my father intends to harm you, may the Lord strike me dead if I don't let you know and send you away so you may go safely. May the Lord be with you as he has been with my father. 
091Sm 20:14 If I remain alive, don't fail to show me the Lord's gracious love so that I don't die. 
091Sm 20:15 And don't stop showing your gracious love to my family forever, not even when the Lord eliminates each of David's enemies from the surface of the earth." 
091Sm 20:16 Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David£º "May the Lord punish any violation of this covenant by the hand of David's enemies." 
091Sm 20:17 Jonathan made David vow again out of his love for him, because he loved him as himself.12
091Sm 20:18 Jonathan said to him, "Tomorrow is the new moon, and you will be missed because your seat is empty. 
091Sm 20:19 On the third day go down quickly and come to the place where you hid earlier. Remain beside the rock at Ezel. 
091Sm 20:20 I'll shoot three arrows to the side of the rock as though I were shooting at a target. 
091Sm 20:21 Then I'll send a servant, saying, 'Go, find the arrows.' If I specifically say to the servant, 'Look, the arrows are on this side of you, get them,' then come out because it's safe for you, and, as surely as the Lord lives, there is no danger. 
091Sm 20:22 But if I say this to the young man£º 'Look, the arrows are beyond you,' then go, for the Lord has sent you away. 
091Sm 20:23 As for the matter about which you and I spoke, remember that the Lord is a witness between us forever."
091Sm 20:24 David hid in the field. When the new moon arrived, the king sat down to eat. 
091Sm 20:25 The king sat down at his place as before, in the seat by the wall. Jonathan stood while Abner sat next to Saul, but David's place was empty. 
091Sm 20:26 Saul didn't say anything that day because he said to himself, "Something has happened; he's unclean; surely he's not clean."
091Sm 20:27 But the next day, on the second day of the new moon, David's place was empty, and so Saul said to his son Jonathan, "Why didn't Jesse's son come to the feast, either yesterday or today?" 
091Sm 20:28 Jonathan answered Saul, "David urgently requested that I let him go to Bethlehem. 
091Sm 20:29 He said, 'Please let me go because our family has a sacrifice in the town, and my brother has ordered me to come. Now, if it's acceptable to you, please let me get away so I can see my brothers.' That's the reason he didn't come to the king's table." 
091Sm 20:30 Saul flew into a rage and said to Jonathan, "You son of a perverse and rebellious woman! Don't I know that you have chosen Jesse's son to your shame and to the shame of your mother who bore you?
091Sm 20:31 As long as Jesse's son lives on the earth, neither you nor your kingdom will be established! Now send someone and bring David to me. He's a dead man!" 
091Sm 20:32 Jonathan asked his father Saul, "Why should he be killed?What did he do?" 
091Sm 20:33 Then Saul threw the spear that was beside him to strike Jonathan down. So Jonathan realized that his father was determined to kill David. 
091Sm 20:34 So on the second day of the new moon Jonathan angrily got up from the table without eating because he was upset about David, and because his father had humiliated him. 
091Sm 20:35 In the morning Jonathan, accompanied by a servant, went out to the field for the appointment with David. 
091Sm 20:36 Jonathan said to his servant, "Run, find the arrows that I'm shooting." As the servant ran, Jonathan shot the arrow beyond him. 
091Sm 20:37 The servant came to the place where Jonathan had shot it, and Jonathan called out to him, "The arrow is beyond you, isn't it?" 
091Sm 20:38 Jonathan called out to the servant, "Hurry, be quick, don't stand around." Jonathan's servant picked up the arrow and brought it to his master. 
091Sm 20:39 The servant was not aware of anything. Only Jonathan and David understood what had happened.2036
091Sm 20:40 Then Jonathan gave his equipment to the servant who was with him and said to him, "Go, take these things to the city." 
091Sm 20:41 The servant went. Then David came out from the south side of the rock, fell on his face, and bowed down three times. The men kissed each other, and both of them cried, but David even more. 
091Sm 20:42 Jonathan said to David, "Go in peace since both of us swore in the name of the Lord£º 'May the Lord be between me and you, and between my descendants and your descendants forever.'" Then David got up and left, while Jonathan went to the city. 
091Sm 21:1 David came to Nob to Ahimelech the priest, and Ahimelech was trembling as he came to meet David. Ahimelech said to him, "Why are you alone, and no one with you?"
091Sm 21:2 David said to Ahimelech the priest, "The king commanded me about a matter, saying to me, 'Don't let anyone know anything about the matter I'm sending you to do and about which I've commanded you. I've directed the young men to a certain place.' 
091Sm 21:3 Now, what do you have available?Give me five loaves of bread or whatever you have."
091Sm 21:4 The priest answered David£º "There is no ordinary bread available; only consecrated bread, provided that the young men have kept themselves from women."
091Sm 21:5 David answered the priest, saying to him, "Indeed, women were kept from us as is usual whenever I go out on a mission, and the equipment of the young men is consecrated even when it's an ordinary journey, so how much more is their equipment consecrated today?" 
091Sm 21:6 So the priest gave him consecrated bread because no bread was there except the Bread of the Presence that had been removed from the Lord's presence and replaced with hot bread on the day it was taken away. 
091Sm 21:7 Now, Doeg the Edomite, one of Saul's officials, was there that day, detained in the Lord's presence. He was the chief of Saul's shepherds. 
091Sm 21:8 David said to Ahimelech, "Is there no spear or sword available here?I took neither my sword nor my weapons with me, because the king's mission is urgent."
091Sm 21:9 The priest said, "The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you struck down in the Valley of Elah is wrapped up in a cloth behind the ephod. If you want it, take it because there is no other except it here." So David said, "There is none like it. Give it to me." 
091Sm 21:10 David got up that day and fled from Saul, and he went to King Achish of Gath. 
091Sm 21:11 The officials of Achish said to him, "Isn't this David, king of the land?Isn't this the one about whom they sang as they danced, 'Saul has struck down his thousands, but David his ten thousands'?"21
091Sm 21:12 David took these words seriously, and he was very frightened of King Achish of Gath. 
091Sm 21:13 So David changed his behavior before them and acted like he was crazy in their presence. He scribbled on the doors of the gate, and let his saliva run down his beard. 
091Sm 21:14 Achish said to his officials, "Look, you see a person acting like a madman. Why'd you bring him to me?
091Sm 21:15 Am I lacking madmen that you bring me this one to act like a madman around me?Shall this one come into my house?" 
091Sm 22:1 David left from there and escaped to the Cave of Adullam. His brothers and all his father's family heard about this and went down to him there. 
091Sm 22:2 Everyone who was in distress, everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was malcontent gathered around him, and he became their leader. There were about 400 men with him. 
091Sm 22:3 David went from there to Mizpah of Moab, and he said to the king of Moab, "Please let my father and mother come and stay with you until I know what God is going to do for me." 
091Sm 22:4 David left them with the king of Moab, and they stayed with him all the time David was in the stronghold.
091Sm 22:5 The prophet Gad said to David, "Don't remain in the stronghold. Go and enter the territory of Judah." So David left and went into the forest of Hereth. 
091Sm 22:6 When Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been found, he was sitting in Gibeah, under the tamarisk tree on the hill, with his spear in his hand. All his officials were standing around him. 
091Sm 22:7 Saul said to his officials who were standing around him, "Listen, men of Benjamin! Will Jesse's son also give fields and vineyards to all of you?Will he make all of you officers over thousands and officers over hundreds?
091Sm 22:8 But all of you have conspired against me, and no one tells me about my son's covenant with Jesse's son. None of you feels sorry for me and tells me that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in wait, as he's doing this day." 
091Sm 22:9 Then Doeg the Edomite, who was in charge of Saul's servants answered£º "I saw Jesse's son coming to Nob to Ahitub's son Ahimelech. 
091Sm 22:10 Ahimelech inquired of the Lord for him, gave him provisions, and gave him the sword of Goliath the Philistine." 
091Sm 22:11 The king sent for Ahitub's son Ahimelech the priest and for all his father's family who were priests at Nob. All of them came to the king. 
091Sm 22:12 Saul said, "Listen, son of Ahitub!" And he said, "Here I am, your majesty."
091Sm 22:13 Then Saul asked him, "Why have you conspired against me - you and Jesse's son - by giving him food and a sword, and by inquiring of God for him, so he can rise up against me to lie in wait, as he's doing today?" 
091Sm 22:14 Ahimelech answered the king, "Who among all your officials is as faithful as David?He is the king's son-in-law, the captain of your bodyguard, and he's honored in your household. 
091Sm 22:15 Is today the first time I inquired of God for him?Absolutely not! The king shouldn't accuse his servant, or any of my father's family of anything, because your servant didn't know anything at all about this." 
091Sm 22:16 The king said, "Ahimelech, you will surely die, you and all your father's family!" 
091Sm 22:17 The king said to the guards, who were standing beside him, "Turn and kill the priests of the Lord because they supported David, and because they knew he was fleeing, but didn't inform me." But the officials of the king did not want to lift their hands to attack the priests of the Lord.22
091Sm 22:18 Then the king said to Doeg, "You turn and attack the priests." Doeg the Edomite turned and attacked the priests. That day he killed eighty-five men who carry the linen ephod. 
091Sm 22:19 He attacked the priestly town of Nob with the sword. Men and women, children and infants, oxen, donkeys and sheep were put to the sword.2218
091Sm 22:20 One man, Ahimelech's son Abiathar, a grandson of Ahitub, escaped and fled to David. 
091Sm 22:21 Abiathar told David that Saul had killed the priests of the Lord. 
091Sm 22:22 David said to Abiathar, "I knew on that day when Doeg the Edomite was there that he would certainly tell Saul! I'm responsible for the deaths of your father's whole family. 
091Sm 22:23 Stay with me, and don't be afraid because the one who seeks my life, seeks your life. Indeed, you will be safe with me." 
091Sm 23:1 Someone told David, "Look, the Philistines are fighting at Keilah and are plundering the threshing floors." 
091Sm 23:2 David inquired of the Lord£º "Shall I go and strike down these Philistines?" The Lord said to David, "Go strike down the Philistines and deliver Keilah."
091Sm 23:3 David's men said to him, "Look, we're afraid here in Judah. How much then, if we go to Keilah against the Philistine army?"
091Sm 23:4 David inquired of the Lord again, and the Lord answered him£º "Get up, go down to Keilah. I'll give the Philistines into your control." 
091Sm 23:5 David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines. He carried off their livestock and defeated them decisively, and so David delivered the inhabitants of Keilah. 
091Sm 23:6 Now when Ahimelech's son Abiathar had fled to David in Keilah, the ephod had come down with him. 
091Sm 23:7 It was reported to Saul that David had come to Keilah, and Saul said, "The Lord has delivered him into my hand because he has shut himself in by going into a town with double gates and bars." 
091Sm 23:8 Saul summoned for battle all his forces to go down to Keilah, to besiege David and his men.
091Sm 23:9 David knew that Saul was devising evil plans against him, and so he said to Abiathar the priest, "Bring the ephod." 
091Sm 23:10 David said, "Lord God of Israel. Your servant has definitely heard that Saul intends to come to Keilah to destroy the town because of me. 
091Sm 23:11 Will the people of Keilah hand me over to him?Will Saul come down just as your servant has heard?Lord God of Israel, please inform your servant." The Lord said, "He will come down."
091Sm 23:12 Then David said, "Will the people of Keilah hand me over to Saul?" The Lord said, "They'll hand you over." 
091Sm 23:13 David and his men, about 600 strong, got up and left Keilah. They moved around wherever they could go. Saul was advised that David had escaped from Keilah, so he stopped the campaign. 
091Sm 23:14 David stayed in the wilderness in the strongholds, and he lived in the hill country in the wilderness of Ziph. Saul sought him every day, but God did not let David slip into Saul's control. 
091Sm 23:15 David was afraid because Saul had come out to seek his life while David was in the wilderness of Ziph at Horesh. 
091Sm 23:16 Saul's son Jonathan got up and went to David at Horesh, and he encouraged him to trust in God. 
091Sm 23:17 Jonathan said to him, "Don't be afraid. My father Saul won't find you, and you will be king over Israel. I'll be your second-in-command. My father Saul also knows this." 
091Sm 23:18 The two of them made a covenant in the Lord's presence. David remained at Horesh while Jonathan went home.
091Sm 23:19 People from Ziph came up to Saul at Gibeah and informed him, "David is hiding with us in the strongholds in Horesh and on the hill of Hachilah south of Jeshimon, isn't he?
091Sm 23:20 Now, your majesty, whenever you want to come down, come down, and our part will be to hand him over to the king."2319
091Sm 23:21 Saul said, "May you be blessed by the Lord, because you have been gracious to me. 
091Sm 23:22 Go and again make sure, find out and investigate where he is and who has seen him there, for people tell me that he's very clever. 
091Sm 23:23 Investigate and find out all the hiding places there where he hides, and return to me with reliable information. Then I'll go down with you, and if he's in the land, I'll search him out among all the thousands of Judah." 
091Sm 23:24 The people from Ziph got up and left Saul, while David and his men were in the wilderness of Maon in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. 
091Sm 23:25 When Saul and his men went to search for David, some people told David, and he went down to the Rock of Escape and remained in the wilderness of Maon. Saul heard this and he pursued David into the wilderness of Maon. 
091Sm 23:26 Saul went on one side of the mountain while David and his men went on the other side of the mountain. David was hurrying to get away from Saul while Saul and his men were closing in on David and his men to capture them.
091Sm 23:27 Then a messenger came to Saul with this news£º "Come quickly, because the Philistines have made a raid on the land!" 
091Sm 23:28 So Saul turned around from pursuing David and went to meet the Philistines. Therefore, they call that place the Rock of Escape. 
091Sm 23:29 David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of En Gedi.23
091Sm 24:1 When Saul returned from pursuing the Philistines, he was told, "Look, David is in the wilderness of En Gedi." 
091Sm 24:2 Saul took 3,000 of his best troops from all over Israel, and he went to look for David and his men in the direction of the Rocks of the Wild Goats. 
091Sm 24:3 He came to the sheepfolds beside the road. There was a cave there, and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the inner recesses  of the cave.
091Sm 24:4 David's men said to him, "Look, today is the day about which the Lord spoke to you when he said, 'I'll give your enemy into your hand.' Do to him whatever you want!" David rose and stealthily cut off the corner of Saul's robe. 
091Sm 24:5 Afterwards, David's conscience bothered him because he had cut off the corner of Saul's robe. 
091Sm 24:6 He said to his men, "God forbid that I should do this thing to your majesty, the Lord's anointed, by stretching out my hand against him, since he's the Lord's anointed." 
091Sm 24:7 David restrained his men with his words and did not allow them to rebel against Saul. Saul got up from the cave and started off.
091Sm 24:8 Then David got up, went out of the cave, and called out to Saul£º "Your majesty!" Saul looked behind him, and David bowed down with his face to the ground and prostrated himself. 
091Sm 24:9 Then David said to Saul, "Why do you listen to the words of those who say, 'Look, David is trying to harm you?' 
091Sm 24:10 Look, this very day you saw with your own eyes that the Lord gave you into my control in the cave, and one of my men said to kill you, but I had pity on you and responded, 'I won't lift my hand against his majesty because he's the Lord's anointed.' 
091Sm 24:11 See, my father, see! The corner of your robe is in my hand. Indeed, by my cutting off the corner of your robe and not killing you, you may know and understand that I have no evil intent or transgression - I haven't wronged you, even though you are hunting me to take my life. 
091Sm 24:12 May the Lord judge between me and you, and may he take vengeance on you for me, but I won't be attacking you. 
091Sm 24:13 Just like the ancient proverb says, 'From wicked people comes wickedness,' but I'm not against you. 
091Sm 24:14 After whom is the king of Israel going out?Whom are you pursuing?A dead dog or a single flea?
091Sm 24:15 May the Lord act as judge, and may he decide between me and you. May he see, may he plead my case, and may he vindicate me in this dispute against you."24
091Sm 24:16 When David had finished saying these things to Saul, Saul asked, "Is this your voice, my son David?" Then Saul cried loudly 
091Sm 24:17 to David, "You are more righteous than I am, because you have treated me well even though I've treated you poorly. 
091Sm 24:18 You have explained how you treated me well, in that the Lord delivered me into your hand but you didn't kill me. 
091Sm 24:19 For who would find his enemy and then send him away safely?May the Lord repay you for what you have done for me today. 
091Sm 24:20 Now I know for certain that you will be king, and that the kingdom will be established under your authority. 
091Sm 24:21 Now swear to me by the Lord that you will never eliminate my descendants after me, and that you won't erase my name from my father's family." 
091Sm 24:22 David made this vow to Saul, and then Saul went home, while David and his men went up to the stronghold. 
091Sm 25:1 Samuel died and all Israel assembled to mourn for him. They buried him at his home in Ramah. David got up and went down to the Wilderness of Paran. 
091Sm 25:2 Now there was a man in Maon whose business was in Carmel of Judah, and the man was very rich. He had 3,000 sheep and 1,000 goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel. 
091Sm 25:3 The man's name was Nabal and his wife's name was Abigail. The woman was intelligent and beautiful, while the man was harsh and wicked in his dealings. He was a descendant of Caleb.
091Sm 25:4 While David was in the wilderness, he heard that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 
091Sm 25:5 David sent ten young men, saying to the young men, "Go up to Carmel, find Nabal, and greet him in my name. 
091Sm 25:6 Then say, 'May you live long. Peace to you, peace to your family, and peace to all that you have. 
091Sm 25:7 Now, I've heard that the sheep shearers are with you. Now, your shepherds have been with us. We didn't harm them, and they didn't miss anything all the time they were in Carmel. 
091Sm 25:8 Ask your young men and they'll tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor with you since we came on a special day. Please give whatever you have available to your servants and to your son David.'"
091Sm 25:9 David's young men came to Nabal and told him all this in David's name, and then they waited. 
091Sm 25:10 Nabal answered David's servants£º "Who is David?Who is this son of Jesse?There are many servants today who are breaking away from their masters. 
091Sm 25:11 Should I take my food, my water, and my meat that I've slaughtered for my shearers and give it to men who came from who knows where?"
091Sm 25:12 David's men turned and went on their way. They came back and told David everything. 
091Sm 25:13 David said to his men, "Put on your swords." They put on their swords, and David put on his sword. Then about 400 men followed David, while 200 stayed with the supplies. 
091Sm 25:14 Now, one of the young men told Nabal's wife Abigail£º "Look, David sent messengers from the wilderness to greet our lord, but he screamed insults at them. 
091Sm 25:15 The men were very good to us. They didn't harm us, and we didn't miss anything all the time we moved around with them when we were in the field. 
091Sm 25:16 They were a wall around us both day and night, all the time we were with them taking care of the sheep. 
091Sm 25:17 Now, be aware of this and consider what you should do. Calamity is being planned against our master and against his entire household. He's such a worthless person that no one can talk to him." 
091Sm 25:18 Abigail quickly took 200 loaves of bread, two skins of wine, five butchered sheep, five measures of roasted grain, 100 bunches of raisins, and 200 fig cakes and loaded them on donkeys. 
091Sm 25:19 She said to her young men, "Go ahead of me, I'll be coming right behind you." But she said nothing to her husband Nabal. 
091Sm 25:20 She was riding on the donkey and as she went down a protected part of the mountain, David was there with his men, coming down to meet her, and she went toward them. 
091Sm 25:21 Now David had said, "Surely it was for nothing that I protected everything that belonged to this man in the wilderness, and nothing was missing of all that belonged to him. But he has repaid me with evil for good! 
091Sm 25:22 May the Lord do this to the enemies of David - and more also - if by the morning I've left alive a single male of all those who belong to him." 
091Sm 25:23 When Abigail saw David, she quickly got down from the donkey and fell on her face before David, prostrating herself on the ground. 
091Sm 25:24 She fell at his feet and pleaded, "Your majesty, let the guilt be on me alone, and please let your servant speak to you. Listen to the words of your servant. 
091Sm 25:25 Please, your majesty, don't pay attention to this worthless man Nabal, for he's just like his name. Nabal is his name and folly is his constant companion. But I, your servant, didn't see your majesty's young men whom you sent. 
091Sm 25:26 Now, your majesty, as the Lord lives and as you live, the Lord has kept you from shedding blood and from delivering yourself by your own actions. Now, may your enemies and those seeking to do evil to your majesty be like Nabal. 
091Sm 25:27 Now let this present that your servant has brought to your majesty be given to the young men who follow your majesty. 
091Sm 25:28 Please forgive the offense of your servant. For the Lord will certainly make a strong dynasty for your majesty, for your majesty is fighting the Lord's battles. May evil not be found in you for all of your life. 
091Sm 25:29 If anyone should arise to pursue you and seek your life, may the life of your majesty be bound up with the Lord your God in a bundle of the living, and may he sling out the lives of your enemies from the pocket of a sling. 
091Sm 25:30 When the Lord does for your majesty all the good that he promised concerning you and appoints you commander-in-chief over Israel, 
091Sm 25:31 this shouldn't be an obstacle or stumbling block for your majesty's conscience, that he poured out blood without cause or that your majesty delivered himself. When the Lord does good things for your majesty, remember your servant." 
091Sm 25:32 David said to Abigail, "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who sent you to meet me today. 
091Sm 25:33 Blessed be your good judgment, and blessed be you, who today stopped me from shedding blood and delivering myself by my own actions. 
091Sm 25:34 For as surely as the Lord God of Israel lives, the one who restrained me from harming you - indeed, had you not quickly come to meet me, by dawn there wouldn't be a single male left to Nabal."
091Sm 25:35 David took from her what she had brought him and said to her, "Go up to your house in peace. Look, I've heard your request and will grant it." 
091Sm 25:36 Abigail returned to Nabal, and he was there in his house holding a feast like the feast of a king. Nabal's heart was glad, and he was very drunk, so she didn't tell him anything at all until morning. 
091Sm 25:37 After Nabal became sober the next morning, his wife told him all that had happened. Nabal's heart failed and he became paralyzed. 
091Sm 25:38 About ten days later the Lord struck Nabal, and he died.36
091Sm 25:39 When David heard that Nabal had died, he said, "Blessed be the Lord who has judged the dispute over my insult at the hand of Nabal, and has held back his servant from evil. The Lord has repaid Nabal's wickedness." Then David sent word to Abigail that he would take her as his wife.
091Sm 25:40 David's servants went to Abigail at Carmel and said to her, "David sent us to you to take you to him as his wife."25
091Sm 25:41 She got up, prostrated herself face down on the ground, and replied, "Your servant would be a slave to wash the feet of your majesty's servants." 
091Sm 25:42 Then Abigail quickly got up and got on a donkey, with five young women walking behind her. She followed David's messengers, and she became his wife. 
091Sm 25:43 David also married Ahinoam of Jezreel, and both of them became his wives. 
091Sm 25:44 Meanwhile, Saul had given his daughter Michal, David's wife, to Laish's son Palti from Gallim. 
091Sm 26:1 People from Ziph came to Saul in Gibeah and informed him, "David is hiding on the hill of Hachilah which is across from Jeshimon, isn't he?" 
091Sm 26:2 So Saul rose and went down with 3,000 select men of Israel to the Wilderness of Ziph, to look for David in the Wilderness of Ziph. 
091Sm 26:3 Saul camped by the road on the hill of Hachilah, across from Jeshimon, while David was staying in the wilderness. When he realized that Saul had come after him in the wilderness, 
091Sm 26:4 David sent out spies and found out for certain that Saul had arrived. 
091Sm 26:5 David rose and went to the place where Saul was camped. David saw the place where Saul and Abner, his commander-in-chief, lay down. Saul was lying down within the encampment, and the army was camped all around him.
091Sm 26:6 David said to Ahimelech the Hittite, and to Joab's brother Abishai, Zeruiah's son, "Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?" Abishai said, "I'll go down with you."
091Sm 26:7 David and Abishai went to the army at night, and Saul was lying there asleep in the encampment. His spear was stuck in the ground at his head, and Abner and the army were lying all around him. 
091Sm 26:8 Abishai said to David, "Today God has delivered your enemy into your hand. Let me run the spear through him into the ground with a single blow. I won't need to strike him twice!" 
091Sm 26:9 David said to Abishai, "Don't destroy him. Who can raise his hand to strike the Lord's anointed and remain innocent?
091Sm 26:10 As the Lord lives, the Lord will strike him down, or his time will come to die, or he will go into battle and perish. 
091Sm 26:11 The Lord forbid that I should raise my hand against the Lord's anointed. Now take the spear that is at his head and the jug of water, and let's go." 
091Sm 26:12 So David took the spear and the jug of water at Saul's head, and they left. No one saw, and no one knew, because no one was awake. They were all asleep, because a deep sleep from the Lord had fallen over them. 
091Sm 26:13 Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on top of the hill some distance away with a large distance between them. 
091Sm 26:14 David called out to the army and to Ner's son Abner, "Abner, won't you answer me?" Abner answered£º "Who are you who calls out to the king?"
091Sm 26:15 David said to Abner, "Are you not a man, and who is like you in Israel?Why didn't you guard your lord, the king?Indeed, a soldier came to destroy the king, your lord. 
091Sm 26:16 This thing that you did is not good. As the Lord lives, you deserve to die, you who didn't guard your lord, the Lord's anointed. Where is the king's spear and where is the jug of water that was at his head?" 
091Sm 26:17 Saul recognized David's voice and said, "Is this your voice, my son David?" David replied, "It is my voice, your majesty." 
091Sm 26:18 David said, "Why is your majesty pursuing his servant?For what have I done, and what evil do I bear toward you?
091Sm 26:19 Now let your majesty listen to the words of his servant. If the Lord incited you against me, then may he accept an offering. But if it is people, may they be cursed in the Lord's presence, because they have driven me out today from sharing in the inheritance of the Lord by saying, 'Go serve other gods.'
091Sm 26:20 Now, don't let my blood fall to the ground away from the Lord's presence. Indeed, the king of Israel has come out to seek a single flea, like someone hunts a partridge in the mountains." 
091Sm 26:21 Then Saul said, "I've wronged you. Return, my son David, for I won't harm you again because my life was precious to you today. Look, I've acted foolishly and have made a very great mistake."26
091Sm 26:22 David replied, "Here's the king's spear. Have one of the young men come over and get it. 
091Sm 26:23 The Lord repays a person for his righteousness and his faithfulness. The Lord gave you into my control today, but I refused to raise my hand against the Lord's anointed. 
091Sm 26:24 Look, just as your life was valuable in my eyes today, so may my life be valuable in the Lord's eyes, and may he deliver me from all trouble."2623
091Sm 26:25 Saul said to David, "Blessed are you, my son David. In whatever you do you will surely succeed." So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place. 
091Sm 27:1 David said to himself, "One of these days I'll perish by Saul's hand. There is nothing better for me to do than to escape to Philistine territory. Saul will give up searching for me any more within the borders of Israel, so I'll escape from him." 
091Sm 27:2 So David got up, and he and the 600 men who were with him went to Maon's son Achish, the king of Gath. 
091Sm 27:3 David stayed with Achish in Gath along with his men, each of whom was with his household. David had his two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, who had been the wife of Nabal of Carmel. 
091Sm 27:4 Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, and he did not continue to search for him.
091Sm 27:5 David said to Achish, "If it pleases you, give me a place in one of the outlying towns, so I may live there. Why should your servant live with you in the royal city?" 
091Sm 27:6 So that day Achish gave him Ziklag, and therefore, Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah until the present time. 
091Sm 27:7 David lived in Philistine territory for a year and four months. 
091Sm 27:8 David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites, for they had been living in the land since ancient times, from the entrance of Shur all the way to the land of Egypt. 
091Sm 27:9 David struck the land and did not leave a man or woman alive. He took sheep, cattle, donkeys, camels, and clothing, and then came back and went to Achish.
091Sm 27:10 Achish said, "Where did you raid today?" David answered, "Against the Negev of Judah, against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites, and against the Negev of the Kenites." 
091Sm 27:11 David did not leave a man or woman alive to bring to Gath. He told himself, "Otherwise, they'll say, 'This is what David is doing, and this has been his practice all the time he has lived in Philistine territory.'"
091Sm 27:12 Achish believed David, telling himself, "He has certainly made himself repulsive to his people in Israel. He will be my servant forever."27
091Sm 28:1 At that time the Philistines assembled their army for war to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, "You know, of course, that you and your men will go out with me into the battle."
091Sm 28:2 David said to Achish, "Very well, you will now see what your servant will do." Achish said to David, "Very well, I'll appoint you as my permanent bodyguard." 
091Sm 28:3 Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in his own town of Ramah. Saul had expelled the mediums and spiritists from the land. 
091Sm 28:4 The Philistines assembled, moved out, and camped at Shunem, while Saul assembled all Israel and camped at Gilboa. 
091Sm 28:5 When Saul saw the Philistine camp, he was afraid, and his heart trembled greatly. 
091Sm 28:6 Saul inquired of the Lord, but the Lord did not answer him, either through dreams or Urim or through prophets. 
091Sm 28:7 Saul said to his servants, "Find me a woman who is a medium so I can go to her and make my inquiry through her." His servants said to him, "Look, there's a woman at Endor who is a medium." 
091Sm 28:8 Saul disguised himself, putting on different clothes. He went along with two men to the woman at night. He said, "Consult a familiar spirit for me and bring up for me the one whom I tell you."
091Sm 28:9 The woman said to him, "Look, you know what Saul has done. He has removed mediums and spiritists from the land, so why are you trying to entrap me, so as to cause my death?"
091Sm 28:10 Saul swore to her by the Lord£º "As surely as the Lord lives, no punishment will come on you for this thing." 
091Sm 28:11 The woman said, "Whom shall I bring up for you?" Saul said, "Bring up Samuel for me."
091Sm 28:12 When the woman saw Samuel, she cried out loudly. The woman said to Saul, "Why have you deceived me?You are Saul!"
091Sm 28:13 The king said to her, "Don't be afraid; but what do you see?" The woman said to Saul, "I see a divine being coming up out of the ground."
091Sm 28:14 Saul said to her, "What does he look like?" She said, "An old man is coming up, and he's wrapped in a robe." Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed low to the ground and prostrated himself. 
091Sm 28:15 Samuel said to Saul, "Why did you disturb me by bringing me up?" Saul said, "I'm in great distress. The Philistines are waging war against me. God has departed from me and won't answer me any more, either by messages written by the hand of the prophets or by dreams. So I've summoned you to tell me what Ishou ld do."
091Sm 28:16 Samuel said, "Why do you ask me, since the Lord has departed from you and become your enemy?
091Sm 28:17 The Lord has done to you exactly as he spoke through me. The Lord has torn the kingdom away from you and has given it to your colleague David. 
091Sm 28:18 Because you didn't obey the Lord and didn't display his fierce anger against Amalek, therefore, the Lord will do this thing to you today. 
091Sm 28:19 The Lord is giving both you, and Israel with you, into Philistine control. Tomorrow, the Lord will give you, your sons with you, and also the army of Israel into the control of the Philistines." 
091Sm 28:20 Saul immediately fell down full-length on the ground. He was terrified because of Samuel's words, and he had no strength because he had not eaten food all day and all night. 
091Sm 28:21 Then the woman came to Saul and saw that he was very disturbed. She said to him, "Look, your servant obeyed you. I put my life into your hands, and I listened to your words that you spoke to me. 
091Sm 28:22 Now, please listen to your servant. I'll put a piece of bread before you so you can eat and have strength to go on your way."2821
091Sm 28:23 Saul refused, saying, "I won't eat!" Both his servants and the woman urged him, and so he listened to them. He got up off the ground and sat on the bed. 
091Sm 28:24 The woman had a fattened calf in the house, and she quickly slaughtered it. She took flour, kneaded it, and baked unleavened bread. 
091Sm 28:25 She brought it to Saul and to his servants, and they ate. Then they got up and went out that night. 
091Sm 29:1 The Philistines gathered all their troops at Aphek, while Israel was camped at the spring in Jezreel. 
091Sm 29:2 The Philistine leaders were passing in review among the military units, and David and his men were among them in the rear with Achish.
091Sm 29:3 The Philistine leaders said, "What are these Hebrews doing here?" Achish asked the Philistine leaders, "Isn't this David, the servant of King Saul of Israel, who has been with me these days, or rather these years?I've found no fault in him from the day he deserted until now."
091Sm 29:4 But the Philistine leaders were angry with him, so they pleaded with him, "Send the man back! Let him return to the place you assigned him. He mustn't go into battle with us. Otherwise, he may become our adversary in the battle! How could there be a better way for this fellow to reconcile himself with his lord?Wouldn't it be with the heads of these men?
091Sm 29:5 Isn't this the same David about whom the maidens sang when they were dancing, 'Saul has struck down his thousands, but David his ten thousands'?"
091Sm 29:6 Then Achish summoned David and said to him, "As surely as the Lord lives, you are trustworthy, and it seems good to me for you to campaign with me as part of the army. Indeed, I've not found any evil in you from the time you came to me until now. But the leaders don't approve of you.
091Sm 29:7 Now return and go in peace, so you do nothing to displease the Philistine leaders." 
091Sm 29:8 David said to Achish, "What have I done, and what have you found in your servant from the time I came before you until this very moment, that I shouldn't go out and fight the enemies of your majesty?"
091Sm 29:9 Achish answered David, "I know that I'm pleased with you. You're like an angel of God. But the Philistine leaders have said, 'He mustn't go into battle with us.' 
091Sm 29:10 Now, get up early in the morning along with your lord's servants who came with you. Get up early in the morning, and go as soon as you have light." 
091Sm 29:11 So David and his men got up early in the morning to return to Philistine territory, while the Philistines went up to Jezreel. 
091Sm 30:1 When David and his men came to Ziklag on the third day, the Amalekites had raided the Negev and Ziklag. They had attacked Ziklag and set it on fire. 
091Sm 30:2 They took the women in it captive, from young to old. They did not kill anyone. Instead, they carried them off and went on their way. 
091Sm 30:3 David and his men came to the town, and it had been burned down. Their wives, their sons, and their daughters had been taken captive. 
091Sm 30:4 Then David and the people who were with him lifted their voices and cried until they had no more strength left to cry. 
091Sm 30:5 David's two wives, Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, Nabal's former wife, had been captured. 
091Sm 30:6 David was in great danger because all the people were bitter because of their sons and daughters, and they were talking about stoning him. But David found strength in the Lord his God.3
091Sm 30:7 David said to Ahimelech's son Abiathar the priest, "Bring me the ephod." So Abiathar brought the ephod to David. 
091Sm 30:8 David inquired of the Lord£º "Shall I pursue this raiding party?Will I overtake them?" The Lord said to David, "Pursue them! You will definitely overtake them and rescue the captives." 
091Sm 30:9 So David and 600 men who were with him set out. They came to the Wadi Besor where those who were left behind stayed. 
091Sm 30:10 David and 400 men continued the pursuit, while the 200 men who were too exhausted to cross over the Wadi Besor remained there. 
091Sm 30:11 They found an Egyptian man in the field, and they took him to David. They gave him food to eat and provided water for him. 
091Sm 30:12 They gave him part of a fig cake and two bunches of raisins. After he had eaten, he revived, since he had neither eaten food nor had he drunk water for three days and three nights. 
091Sm 30:13 David said to him, "To whom do you belong and where are you from?"12 The Egyptian replied, "I'm a young Egyptian man, the slave of an Amalekite man. My master abandoned me, because I got sick three days ago. 
091Sm 30:14 We raided the Negev of the Cherethites, the territory that belongs to Judah, and the Negev of Caleb, and we set Ziklag on fire."
091Sm 30:15 David asked him, "Will you take me to this raiding party?" He said, "Swear to me by God that you won't kill me or turn me over to my master, and I'll take you to the raiding party." 
091Sm 30:16 The Egyptian led him to the camp, and there the Amalekites were spread out over the whole area, eating, drinking, and celebrating with the great amount of spoil they had taken from the territory belonging to the Philistines and to Judah. 
091Sm 30:17 David struck them down from twilight until the evening of the next day, and not one of them escaped except for 400 young men who mounted camels and fled. 
091Sm 30:18 David rescued everyone whom the Amalekites had captured, including his two wives. 
091Sm 30:19 Nothing of theirs was missing, whether small or large, sons or daughters, spoil, or anything that they had taken for themselves - David brought back everything. 
091Sm 30:20 David took all the rest of the sheep and cattle, driving them ahead of their rescued livestock. People said about all this, "This is David's spoil." 
091Sm 30:21 David came to the 200 men who were too exhausted to follow him and who had been left at the Wadi Besor. They came out to meet David and the people who were with him. As David approached the people, he asked them how they were doing. 
091Sm 30:22  At this point, all the wicked and worthless men of the group who had gone with David answered, "Because they didn't go with us, we won't give them any of the spoil that we recovered, except that each person may take his wife and his children and go." 
091Sm 30:23 David said, "No, you won't do this, my brothers, with what the Lord has given us. He guarded us and gave the raiding party that came against us into our hand. 
091Sm 30:24 Who will listen to you in this matter?Indeed, the share of those who went down into battle and the share of those who stayed with the supplies will be the same. They'll share alike." 
091Sm 30:25 From that day forward he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel, and it remains to this present day.3024 
091Sm 30:26 David came to Ziklag, and he sent some of the spoil to the elders of Judah, and to his friends, telling them, "Look, this is a gift for you from the spoil of the enemies of the Lord 
091Sm 30:27 in Bethel, Ramoth-Negev, Jattir, 
091Sm 30:28 Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 
091Sm 30:29 Rachal, in the Jerahmeelite towns, in the Kenite towns, 
091Sm 30:30 in Hormah, Bor-ashan, Athach, 
091Sm 30:31 Hebron, and for all those places where David and his men had frequented."
091Sm 31:1 The Philistines fought against Israel, and the army of Israel fled before the Philistines. They fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 
091Sm 31:2 The Philistines pursued Saul and his sons. The Philistines struck down Jonathan, Abinadab, and Malchishua, Saul's sons. 
091Sm 31:3 The heaviest fighting was directed toward Saul, and when the bowmen who were shooting located Saul, he was severely wounded by them. 
091Sm 31:4 Saul said to his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through with it, or these uncircumcised people will come and run me through and make sport of me." But his armor bearer did not want to do it because he was very frightened, so Saul took the sword and fell on it. 
091Sm 31:5 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him. 
091Sm 31:6 As a result, Saul, his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men died together that day. 
091Sm 31:7 When the men of Israel who were across the valley and who were across the Jordan saw that the army of Israel had fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled, and the Philistines came and occupied them.1
091Sm 31:8 The next day, the Philistines came to strip the dead, and they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 
091Sm 31:9 They cut off his head and stripped him of his weapons. They sent people throughout the territory of the Philistines to report the good news in the temples of their idols and to the people. 
091Sm 31:10 They put Saul's weapons in the temple of Asherah and fastened his corpse to the wall of Beth-shan. 
091Sm 31:11 When the residents of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 
091Sm 31:12 every valiant soldier got up, traveled all night, and removed Saul's body and the bodies of his sons from the wall of Beth-shan. Then they went to Jabesh and cremated the bodies there. 
091Sm 31:13 They took their bones, buried them under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh, and fasted for seven days.

102Sm 1:1 Shortly after Saul had died, David returned from defeating the Amalekites and remained in Ziklag for two days. 
102Sm 1:2 The next day, a man escaped from Saul's camp! With torn clothes and dirty hair, he approached David, fell to the ground, and bowed down to him.
102Sm 1:3 David asked him, "Where did you come from?He answered him, "I just escaped from Israel's encampment."
102Sm 1:4 David continued questioning him, "How did things go?Please tell me!" He replied, "The army has fled the battlefield, many of the army are wounded or have died, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead."
102Sm 1:5 David asked the young man who related the story, "How do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?"
102Sm 1:6 The young man who had been relating the story answered, "I happened to be on Mount Gilboa and there was Saul, leaning on his spear! Meanwhile, the chariots and horsemen were rapidly drawing near. 
102Sm 1:7 Saul glanced behind him, saw me, and called out to me, so I replied, 'Here I am!' 
102Sm 1:8 He asked me, 'Who are you?' So I answered him, 'I'm an Amalekite!' 
102Sm 1:9 He begged me, 'Please - come stand here next to me and kill me, because I'm still alive.' 
102Sm 1:10 So I stood next to him and killed him, because I knew that he wouldn't live after he had fallen. I took the crown that had been on his head, along with the bracelet that had been on his arm, and I have brought them to your majesty."
102Sm 1:11 On hearing this, David grabbed his clothes and tore them, as did all the men who were attending to him. 
102Sm 1:12 They mourned and wept, and then decided to fast until dusk for Saul, for his son Jonathan, for the army of the Lord, and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen in battle.
102Sm 1:13 Meanwhile, David asked the young man who had told him the story, "Where are you from?" He answered, "I'm an Amalekite, the son of a foreign man."
102Sm 1:14 At this David asked him, "How is it that you weren't afraid to raise your hand to strike the Lord's anointed?"
102Sm 1:15 Then David called out to one of his young men and ordered him, "Go up to him and cut him down!" So he attacked him and killed him.
102Sm 1:16 David told him, "Your blood is on your own head, because your own words testified against you! After all, you said, 'I myself have killed the Lord's anointed!'"
102Sm 1:17 So David intoned this song of lament about Saul and his son Jonathan, 
102Sm 1:18 and he gave orders to teach the descendents of Judah the art of warfare, as is recorded in the Book of Jashar:
102Sm 1:19 "Your beauty, Israel, lies slain on your high places! O, how the valiant have fallen!
102Sm 1:20 Don't make it known in Gath! Don't declare it in the avenues of Ashkelon! Otherwise, the daughters of Philistia will rejoice; and the daughters of the uncircumcised will triumph.
102Sm 1:21 Mountains of Gilboa, let no dew or rain fall on you, and may none of your fields be filled with plenty, because in that place the shield of the valiant ones was defiled, the shield of Saul without an anointing with oil.
102Sm 1:22 From the blood of the slain, from the blood of the valiant, Jonathan's bow would not retreat nor would Saul's sword return empty.
102Sm 1:23 Saul and Jonathan, loved and handsome in life, in death were not separated. Swifter than eagles they were, and more valiant than lions.
102Sm 1:24 Daughters of Israel, weep over Saul! He clothed you in scarlet luxury and decorated your garments with gold.
102Sm 1:25 How have the valiant fallen in the tumult of battle! Jonathan lies slain on your high places.
102Sm 1:26 I am in distress for you, my brother Jonathan. You have been most kind to me. Your love for me was extraordinary - beyond love from women.
102Sm 1:27 How the valiant have fallen! How the weapons of war are destroyed!"
102Sm 2:1 Some time later, David inquired of the Lord to ask, "Am I to move to any one of the cities of Judah?" The Lord told him, "Go." So David asked, "To which one?" He replied, "To Hebron."
102Sm 2:2 So David went there, along with his two wives Ahinoam from Jezreel and Abigail, widow of Nabal from Carmel. 
102Sm 2:3 David brought his army with him, each soldier accompanied by his household, and they settled in the cities of Hebron. 
102Sm 2:4 After this, the army of Judah arrived, and they anointed David king over the house of Judah. There they informed David, "The men of Jabesh-gilead buried Saul."
102Sm 2:5 So David sent messengers to the people of Jabesh-gilead and told them, "May the Lord bless you, because you showed gracious love like this to your lord Saul by burying him. 
102Sm 2:6 Now may the Lord reward you with gracious love, as well as faithfulness, to you, too! And I will also reward you because you did this good thing. 
102Sm 2:7 So strengthen yourselves, and be valiant in heart, because your lord Saul has died, and the household of Judah has anointed me to be king over them."
102Sm 2:8 Meanwhile, Ner's son Abner, the commander of Saul's army, had taken Saul's son Ish-bosheth and brought him to Mahanaim. 
102Sm 2:9 He installed him as king over Gilead, the Ashurites, Jezreel, Ephraim, Benjamin, and all of the rest of Israel. 
102Sm 2:10 Ish-bosheth began to reign over Israel at the age of 40 years, and he reigned for two years, even though Judah's lineage followed David. 
102Sm 2:11 The period of David's kingship in Hebron lasted seven years and six months.
102Sm 2:12  Ner's son Abner and the servants of Saul's son Ish-bosheth set out from Mahanaim for Gibeon. 
102Sm 2:13 Zeruiah's son Joab and some of David's staff went out to meet them at the pool of Gibeon. One side encamped on one side of the pool while the other encamped on the other side of the pool.
102Sm 2:14 Abner said to Joab, "Let's have the young men get up and fight in our presence." Joab replied, "Let them come."
102Sm 2:15 So they got up and twelve were counted to represent Benjamin and Saul's son Ish-bosheth and twelve to represent members of David's staff. 
102Sm 2:16 Each man grabbed his opponent by the head, plunged his sword into his opponent's side, and then they both fell together. That's why the place at Gibeon was named The Field of Swords. 
102Sm 2:17 The battle was very violent that day, with Abner and the men of Israel being defeated in the presence of David's servants.
102Sm 2:18 Zeruiah's three sons Joab, Abishai, and Asahel were there. As a runner, Asahel was fast, like one of the wild gazelles. 
102Sm 2:19 So Asahel ran straight after Abner, following him. 
102Sm 2:20 When Abner looked behind him, he said, "Is that you, Asahel?"18 He answered, "I am."
102Sm 2:21 Abner told him, "Go off to your right or left after one of the young men and grab some war spoils." But Asahel would not stop following him, 
102Sm 2:22 so Abner told Asahel again, "Stop following me. Why should I strike you down?How could I show my face to your brother Joab?"
102Sm 2:23 But Asahel refused to turn away, so Abner struck Asahel in the abdomen with the butt end of his spear, and the spear protruded through his back. He collapsed to the ground and died where he fell. Everyone gathered round the place where Asahel had collapsed and died, and stood still there.2
102Sm 2:24 Meanwhile, Joab and Abishai continued to chase Abner. At dusk, as they approached the hill of Ammah that is located near Giah on the way to the Gibeon desert, 
102Sm 2:25 the Benjaminites rallied around Abner, forming a single military force. They took their stand on top of the hill.
102Sm 2:26 Then Abner called out to Joab, "Must the battle sword keep on devouring forever?Don't you realize that the end result is bitterness?How long will it take for you to order your army to stop pursuing their own relatives?"
102Sm 2:27 Joab answered, "As God lives, if you hadn't spoken up, by morning my army would have broken off their pursuit of their own relatives." 
102Sm 2:28 So Joab sounded his battle trumpet, his entire army stopped pursuing Israel any longer, and they quit fighting.
102Sm 2:29 Abner and his army traveled through the Arabah by night, crossed the Jordan, and arrived at Mahanaim after marching all morning. 
102Sm 2:30 Joab returned from his pursuit of Abner, and when he had mustered his entire army, nineteen of David's soldiers were missing besides Asahel. 
102Sm 2:31 Meanwhile, other soldiers of David had killed 360 of Abner's men from the tribe of Benjamin. 
102Sm 2:32 They retrieved Asahel's body and buried him in his father's tomb at Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men marched all night until daybreak and arrived back in Hebron.
102Sm 3:1 After this, a state of protracted war existed between Saul's dynasty and David's dynasty, and the dynasty of David continued to grow and become strong while the dynasty of Saul continued to grow weaker. 
102Sm 3:2 During this time, sons were born to David while he was living in Hebron. His firstborn was Amnon by Ahinoam from Jezreel, 
102Sm 3:3 his second was Chileab by Abigail, widow of Nabal from Carmel, his third was Absalom by Maacah, daughter of King Talmai from Geshur, 
102Sm 3:4 his fourth was Adonijah by Haggith, his fifth was Shephatiah by Abital, 
102Sm 3:5 and his sixth was Ithream by David's wife Eglah. They were all born to David in Hebron.4
102Sm 3:6 While war continued between the dynasties of Saul and David, Abner was growing in influence within the dynasty of Saul. 
102Sm 3:7 Meanwhile, Saul had a mistress named Rizpah, who was the daughter of Aiah. Ish-bosheth asked Abner, "Why did you have sex with my father's mistress?"
102Sm 3:8 What Ish-bosheth said made Abner furious, so he replied, "A dog's head for Judah - is that what I am?Up until today I've kept on showing loyalty to your father Saul's dynasty, to his relatives and friends, and I haven't turned you over to David, but you're charging me today with moral guilt regarding this woman! 
102Sm 3:9 Therefore may God do to me - and more also! - just as the Lord has promised to David, since I'm doing this for him£º 
102Sm 3:10 I will take away the kingdom from the dynasty of Saul by making the throne of David firm over Israel and Judah - from Dan to Beersheba!"
102Sm 3:11 Ish-bosheth couldn't say another word in response to Abner, because he was terrified of him. 
102Sm 3:12 So Abner sent messengers to David at Hebron to ask him, "Who owns this land?Cut a deal with me, and look! - I'll lend my hand in bringing all of Israel over to you!"
102Sm 3:13 David replied, "Sounds good to me! I'll cut a deal with you under one condition£º you're not to show yourself in my presence unless you bring Saul's daughter with you when you come to see me." 
102Sm 3:14 Then David sent a delegation to Saul's son Ish-bosheth to say, "Give me my wife Michal, to whom I was engaged with a dowry of 100 Philistine foreskins."
102Sm 3:15 So Ish-bosheth ordered that she be taken away from her husband, Laish's son Paltiel. 
102Sm 3:16 Her husband accompanied her, crying as he followed after her all the way to Bahurim, where Abner told him, "Leave! Go back!" So he went back.
102Sm 3:17 Later, Abner had a talk with the elders of Israel. He said, "In the past you were looking to see David made king over you. 
102Sm 3:18 So do it, then! Because the Lord has said this about David£º 'Through my servant David I will save my people Israel from the control of the Philistines and from all of their enemies.'"
102Sm 3:19 Abner also addressed the tribe of Benjamin. Furthermore, with David's permission, Abner said anything that seemed like it would be good for Israel and for the entire tribe of Benjamin.
102Sm 3:20 Afterwards, Abner brought 20 soldiers to David at Hebron, and David threw a party for Abner and the men who were with him. 
102Sm 3:21 So Abner said to David, "Give me permission to go out and rally all of Israel to your majesty the king so they can enter into a formal agreement with you to reign over everything that your heart desires." So David sent Abner off, and he went away in peace.
102Sm 3:22 Right about then, David's servants returned from a raid, bringing plenty of war booty with them, but Abner wasn't in Hebron with David, since David had sent him away and Abner had left in peace. 
102Sm 3:23 When Joab returned with his entire army, Joab was informed, "Ner's son Abner visited the king, and he has dismissed him. He has left in peace."
102Sm 3:24 So Joab approached the king and asked him, "What have you done?Look, Abner came to you! What's this?You sent him away?He's long gone now! 
102Sm 3:25 You know Ner's son Abner came to mislead you, to learn your troop movements, and to learn everything you're doing!"
102Sm 3:26 As soon as Joab left David, Joab sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the cistern at Sirah, but David was not aware of this. 
102Sm 3:27 When Abner returned to Hebron, Joab brought him aside within the gateway to talk to him alone and then stabbed him in the abdomen. So he died for shedding the blood of Joab's brother Asahel.
102Sm 3:28 Later on, David found out about it and proclaimed, "Let me and my kingdom remain guiltless forever in the Lord's presence for the death of Ner's son Abner. 
102Sm 3:29 May judgment rest on Joab's head and on his father's entire household. May Joab's dynasty never be without one who has a discharge, who is a leper, who walks with a cane, who commits suicide, or who lacks food!" 
102Sm 3:30 He said this because Joab and his brother Abishai murdered Abner after he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.
102Sm 3:31 David ordered Joab and all the people who were with him, "Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn for Abner." King David walked behind the funeral procession, 
102Sm 3:32 and they buried Abner at Hebron. The king wept loudly at Abner's grave, and all the people wept, too. 
102Sm 3:33 The king composed this mourning song for Abner£º "Should Abner's death be like a fool's - 
102Sm 3:34 Your hands were not bound, nor were your feet in irons. As one falls before the wicked, you have fallen."
102Sm 3:35 Then all the people cried again because of him. Everyone tried to persuade David to have a meal while there was still daylight, but David took an oath by saying, "May God to do like this to me and more, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets!"
102Sm 3:36 Everybody took note of this and was very pleased, just as everything else the king did pleased everyone. 
102Sm 3:37 As a result, the entire army and all of Israel understood that day that the king had nothing to do with the murder of Ner's son Abner.
102Sm 3:38 The king reminded his staff, "Don't you know that a prince and a great man has fallen today in Israel?
102Sm 3:39 Today, even though I'm anointed as king, I'm weak. These men, sons of Zeruiah, are too difficult for me. May the Lord repay the one who acts wickedly in accordance with his wickedness!"
102Sm 4:1 When Saul's son heard that Abner had died in Hebron, his courage failed and all of Israel was disturbed. 
102Sm 4:2 Now Saul's son had two officers in charge of some raiding parties. One was named Baanah and the other was named Rechab. They were sons of Rimmon, a Benjaminite from Beeroth, which was considered to belong to the tribe of Benjamin. 
102Sm 4:3 (The residents of Beeroth had evacuated to Gittaim and live there as resident aliens to this day.)
102Sm 4:4 Meanwhile, Saul's son Jonathan had a son whose feet were crippled. When he was five years old, news had arrived about Saul and Jonathan from Jezreel, and his nurse picked him up to flee, but in her hurry to leave, he happened to fall and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.
102Sm 4:5 Rechab and Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, left and arrived during the hottest part of the day at the home of Ish-bosheth while he was taking a noon day nap. 
102Sm 4:6 They entered the house as though they intended to obtain some grain and stabbed him in the abdomen. Then Rechab and his brother Baanah escaped. 
102Sm 4:7 While they were in the house, they struck him, killed him, and cut off his head while he was lying on his bed in his bedroom. They took his head, and traveled all night along the Arabah road.
102Sm 4:8 They brought Ish-bosheth's head to David at Hebron and said to the king, "Look! Here's the head of your enemy Ish-bosheth, Saul's son, who sought your life. Today the Lord has given your majesty the king vengeance on Saul and his descendants."
102Sm 4:9 David responded to Rechab and his brother Baanah, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite£º "As the Lord lives, who has saved my life in every adversity, 
102Sm 4:10 when the man who told me 'Look! Saul is dead!' thought he was bringing me good news, I arrested him and had him killed at Ziklag as the reward I gave him for his news. 
102Sm 4:11 How much worse will it be, then, when evil men kill an innocent man on his own bed in his own house! Shouldn't I avenge his blood - which you are responsible for shedding - by removing you from the earth?" 
102Sm 4:12 So David commanded his personal guards, and they killed Rechab and Baanah, cut off their hands and feet, and hung up their bodies beside the pool at Hebron. They took Ish-bosheth's head and buried it in Abner's tomb at Hebron.411
102Sm 5:1 After this, all of the tribes of Israel assembled with David at Hebron and declared, "Look, we're your own flesh and blood! 
102Sm 5:2 Even back when Saul was our king, it was you who kept on leading Israel out to battle and bringing them back again. The Lord said to you, 'You yourself will shepherd my people Israel and serve as commander-in-chief over Israel.'" 
102Sm 5:3 So all the elders of Israel approached the king at Hebron, where King David entered into a covenant with them in the presence of the Lord. Then they anointed David to be king over Israel.
102Sm 5:4 David began to reign when he was 30 years old, and he reigned 40 years. 
102Sm 5:5 He reigned over Judah for seven years and six months in Hebron, and he reigned over all of Israel including Judah for 33 years in Jerusalem. 
102Sm 5:6 Later, the king and his army marched on Jerusalem against the Jebusites, who were inhabiting the territory at that time and who had told David, "You're not coming in here! Even the blind and the lame could turn you away!" because they were thinking "David can't come here." 
102Sm 5:7 Even so, David captured the stronghold of Zion, which is now known as the City of David.
102Sm 5:8 At that time, David had said, "Whoever intends to attack the Jebusites will have to climb up the water shaft to attack the lame and blind, who hate David." Therefore they say, "The blind and lame shall never come into the house." 
102Sm 5:9 David occupied the fortress, naming it the City of David. He built up the surroundings from the terrace ramparts inward. 
102Sm 5:10 David became more and more esteemed because the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies was with him.
102Sm 5:11 Later, King Hiram of Tyre sent a delegation to David, accompanied by cedar logs, carpenters, and stone masons. They built a palace for David. 
102Sm 5:12 So David concluded that the Lord had established him as king over Israel and that he had exalted his kingdom in order to benefit his people Israel. 
102Sm 5:13 But after arriving in Jerusalem after leaving Hebron, David took more wives and mistresses, and more sons and daughters were born to David. 
102Sm 5:14 These are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem£º Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
102Sm 5:15 Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 
102Sm 5:16 Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.
102Sm 5:17 When the Philistines eventually learned that Israel had anointed David to be king over Israel, they marched out in search of him. But David heard about it and retreated to his stronghold. 
102Sm 5:18 Meanwhile, the Philistines arrived and encamped in the Rephaim Valley, 
102Sm 5:19 so David asked the Lord, "Am I to go attack the Philistines?Will you give me victory over them?" "Go get them," the Lord replied to David, "because I'm going to put the Philistines right into your hand!"
102Sm 5:20 So David went to Baal-perazim and defeated them there. He called the place Baal-perazim, because he said, "Like a bursting flood, the Lord has jumped out in front of me to fight my enemies." 
102Sm 5:21 The Philistines abandoned their idols there, and David and his army carried them off.520
102Sm 5:22 Later, the Philistines once again marched out and encamped in the Rephaim Valley. 
102Sm 5:23 When David asked the Lord about it, he said, "Don't attack them directly. Instead, go around to the rear and attack them opposite those balsam trees. 
102Sm 5:24 When you hear the sound of marching coming from the tops of the balsam trees, then be sure to act quickly, since the Lord will have gone out ahead of you to cut down the Philistine army." 
102Sm 5:25 So David did exactly what the Lord ordered him to do, and he struck down the Philistines from Geba to Gezer.524
102Sm 6:1 After this, David gathered together again 30,000 men from all of the choicest men of Israel. 
102Sm 6:2 Then David and all the people with him set out from Baale-judah to bring up from there the ark of God, who is called the Name, the name of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, and who is enthroned on the cherubim. 
102Sm 6:3 They mounted the ark of God on a new cart and brought it from Abinadab's home in Gibeah, with Abinadab's sons Uzzah and Ahio driving the new cart. 
102Sm 6:4 As they left Abinadab's house in Gibeah accompanied by the ark of God, Ahio was walking ahead of the ark. 
102Sm 6:5 David and the entire assembly of Israel were dancing in the presence of the Lord with all of their strength, accompanied by all sorts of wood instruments, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.
102Sm 6:6 When they arrived at Nacon's threshing floor, Uzzah reached out and grabbed the ark of God because the oxen had stumbled. 
102Sm 6:7 Just then, the anger of the Lord blazed against Uzzah, and God struck him down right there because of his failure, and he died there beside the ark of God.
102Sm 6:8 David flew into a rage because the Lord had killed Uzzah. That's why that place is called Perez-uzzah to this day. 
102Sm 6:9 But David feared the Lord that day, and asked, "How can the ark of God come to me?" 
102Sm 6:10 As a result, David was unwilling to take the ark of the Lord into his care in the city of David. Instead, David left it at the home of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
102Sm 6:11 So the ark of the Lord remained for three months in the household of Obed-edom the Gittite while the Lord blessed Obed-edom and his entire household.10
102Sm 6:12 Later on, David was informed, "The Lord has blessed the home of Obed-edom and everything he has since he's in possession of the ark of God." So David went out joyfully and brought up the ark of God to the City of David from Obed-edom's home. 
102Sm 6:13 After those who were carrying the ark of the Lord had taken six steps, he sacrificed oxen and fattened animals, 
102Sm 6:14 dancing in front of the Lord with all of his strength and wearing a linen ephod. 
102Sm 6:15 So David and the entire assembly of Israel brought up the ark of the Lord with shouting and trumpet blasts.
102Sm 6:16 As the ark of the Lord was coming into the City of David, Saul's daughter Michal was peering out a window, watching King David jumping and dancing in the Lord's presence, and she despised him in her heart. 
102Sm 6:17 They brought in the ark of the Lord, set it in place inside the tent that David had erected for it, and David sacrificed burnt offerings and peace offerings in the presence of the Lord.
102Sm 6:18 After David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies 
102Sm 6:19 and distributed to all the people - the entire multitude of Israel, including both men and women - a cake made of bread, one made of dates, and one made of raisins to each one. Then all the people left, each headed for home.
102Sm 6:20 When David returned to bless his household, Saul's daughter Michal came out to meet him and called out, "How the king of Israel honored himself today by undressing himself right in front of his women staff members, just like any pervert would dare to expose himself!"6
102Sm 6:21 But David replied to Michal, "It was in front of the Lord, who appointed me to replace your father and his entire household by selecting me as commander-in-chief over Israel, the people of the Lord, that I danced in front of the Lord. 
102Sm 6:22 I'm going to act more shamelessly than this, even to humbling myself in my own eyes. Now as to the women staff members about whom you have spoken, they are to hold me in honor!" 
102Sm 6:23 And Saul's daughter Michal bore no children from that day on until the day she died.226
102Sm 7:1 After the king had settled down in his palace and the Lord had given him respite from all of his surrounding enemies, 
102Sm 7:2 he said to the prophet Nathan, "Look now, I'm living in a cedar palace, but the ark of God resides behind a tent curtain."
102Sm 7:3 Nathan replied to the king, "Go do everything you have in mind, because the Lord is with you."
102Sm 7:4 But later that same night, this message came to Nathan from the Lord:
102Sm 7:5 "Go tell my servant David, 'This is what the Lord says£º "'"Are you going to build a temple for me to inhabit?
102Sm 7:6 After all, I haven't lived in a temple since the day I brought up the Israelites from Egypt until now. Instead, I've moved around in a tent or tabernacle. 
102Sm 7:7 Wherever I moved among the Israelites, did I ever ask even one tribal leader of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, 'Why haven't you built me a cedar temple?'
102Sm 7:8 "'"Now therefore this is what you are to tell my servant David£º 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º "I took you from the pasture myself - from tending sheep - to become commander-in-chief over my people, that is, over Israel.
102Sm 7:9 "'"Furthermore, I have remained with you everywhere you have gone, annihilating all your enemies right in front of you. I will make a great reputation for you, like the reputation of great ones who have lived on earth. 
102Sm 7:10 I will establish a homeland for my people - for Israel - planting them so they may live in a secure location where they will never be disturbed anymore. Wicked people will no longer afflict them, as happened in the past 
102Sm 7:11 when I had commanded judges to administer my people Israel. I'll also grant you relief from all your enemies."' "'The Lord also announces to you£º "The Lord will craft a dynasty for you. 
102Sm 7:12 When your life is complete and you go to join your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, who will come forth from your body, and I will fortify his kingdom. 
102Sm 7:13 He will build a temple dedicated to my Name, and I will make the throne of his kingdom last forever. 
102Sm 7:14 I will be a father to him, and he will be to me a son who, when he commits iniquity, I will discipline with the rod wielded by armies and with wounds inflicted by human beings. 
102Sm 7:15 But I'll never remove my gracious love from him as I did from Saul, whom I removed from your presence. 
102Sm 7:16 Your dynasty and your kingdom will remain forever in my presence - your throne will be secure forever."'"
102Sm 7:17 Nathan communicated this complete oracle to David with precisely these words.
102Sm 7:18 Then King David went in to the presence of the Lord, sat down, and said£º "Who am I, Lord God, and what is my household, since you have brought me to this?
102Sm 7:19 And this is still a small thing to you, Lord God, and yet you have spoken to your servant's household for a great while to come, and this is the charter of mankind, Lord God.
102Sm 7:20 "What more can David say to you, and you surely know your servant, Lord God. 
102Sm 7:21 For the sake of your word and consistent with your desire, you have done all of these great things, informing your servant. 
102Sm 7:22 And therefore you are great, Lord God, there is no one like you, there is no God except for you, just as we've heard with our own ears.
102Sm 7:23 "And who is like your people, like Israel, the one nation on earth that God went out to redeem as a people for himself, to make a name for himself, and to carry out for them great and awe-inspiring accomplishments, driving out nations and their gods in front of your people, whom you redeemed to yourself from Egypt?
102Sm 7:24 You have prepared your people Israel to be your very own people for ever, and you, Lord, have become their God!
102Sm 7:25 "And now, Lord God, let what you have spoken concerning your servant and his household be done - and let it be done just as you've promised. 
102Sm 7:26 May your name be made great forever with the result that it is said that the Lord of the Heavenly Armies is God over Israel, and that the household of your servant David may be established before you. 
102Sm 7:27 For you, Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, have revealed this to your servant, telling him, 'I will build a dynasty for you,' so that your servant has found fortitude to pray this prayer to you.
102Sm 7:28 "Now therefore, Lord God, you are God, and your words are true, and you have spoken to your servant these good things. 
102Sm 7:29 So may it please you to bless the household of your servant, so that it might remain forever in your presence, because you, Lord God, have spoken, and from your blessing may the household of your servant be blessed forever."
102Sm 8:1 Sometime later, David defeated and subdued the Philistines, taking Metheg-ammah away from the Philistines. 
102Sm 8:2 David also conquered Moab, then measured them with a cord, making them lie down on the ground. He executed everyone measured out in each two lengths' measurement of the cord, but spared the ones measured out by every third length. Then the Moabites were placed under servitude to David, and made to pay tribute.
102Sm 8:3 David also attacked King Hadadezer, Rehob's son from Zobah, when he was attempting to restore his hegemony over the Euphrates River. 
102Sm 8:4 David captured 1,000 of his chariots, 1,700 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers. David hamstrung all the chariot horses except for enough to supply 100 chariots. 
102Sm 8:5 When Arameans came from Damascus to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David killed 22,000 of them. 
102Sm 8:6 David erected garrisons in the Aramean kingdom of Damascus, placing the Arameans under servitude to him, and they paid tribute to him. 
102Sm 8:7 David also confiscated the gold shields that belonged to Hadadezer's officers and took them to Jerusalem. 
102Sm 8:8 He also confiscated a vast quantity of bronze from Betah and Berothai, cities under Hadadezer's control.
102Sm 8:9 When King Tou of Hamath learned that David had conquered the entire army of King Hadadezer of Zobah, 
102Sm 8:10 Tou sent his son Joram to King David to greet him and congratulate him on his victory over Hadadezer, because he had been at war with Tou. Joram brought articles of silver, gold, and bronze with him, 
102Sm 8:11 and King David dedicated them to the Lord, along with the silver and gold that had been dedicated from all the nations that he had conquered, 
102Sm 8:12 including from Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, Amalek, and spoil from King Hadadezer, Rehob's son from Zobah.8
102Sm 8:13 David made a name for himself when he returned from killing 18,000 Edomites in the Salt Valley. 
102Sm 8:14 He erected garrisons throughout Edom, and all the Edomites became subservient to David, while the Lord gave victory to David wherever he went.
102Sm 8:15 David reigned over all of Israel, administering justice and equity to every one of his people. 
102Sm 8:16 Zeruiah's son Joab served in charge of the army, Ahilud's son Jehoshaphat was his personal archivist, 
102Sm 8:17 Ahitub's son Zadok and Abiathar's son Ahimelech were priests, Seraiah was his personal secretary, 
102Sm 8:18 Jehoida's son Benaiah supervised the special forces and mercenaries, and David's sons were priests.
102Sm 9:1 Later on, David asked, "Is there anyone left alive from Saul's household to whom I can show gracious love in memory of Jonathan?"
102Sm 9:2 A household servant of Saul named Ziba was called to appear before David, and the king asked him, "Are you Ziba?" "I am your servant," Ziba replied.
102Sm 9:3 At this the king asked, "Isn't there still someone left from Saul's household to whom I may show God's gracious love?" "There's Jonathan's son. He has maimed feet, " Ziba answered.
102Sm 9:4 So David asked, "Where is he?" Ziba responded, "He's in Lo-debar at the home of Ammiel's son Makir."
102Sm 9:5 At this, King David sent for him and brought him from the home of Ammiel's son Makir in Lo-debar. 
102Sm 9:6 When Mephibosheth, Jonathan's son and a grandson of Saul, approached David, he threw himself on his face out of respect.  "Mephibosheth!" David said as he greeted him. "Hello! I am your servant," he replied.9
102Sm 9:7 "Don't be afraid," David reassured him, "because I'm going to show gracious love to you in memory of your father Jonathan. I'm going to restore to you all the land that belonged to your grandfather Saul, and you'll always have a place at my table!"
102Sm 9:8 Mephibosheth bowed low again and asked, "Who am I, your servant, that you would pay attention to a dead dog like me?"
102Sm 9:9 At this, the king called for Saul's servant Ziba and told him, "I'm restoring to your master's grandson everything that belonged to Saul and his family. 
102Sm 9:10 You and your servants are to farm the land on his behalf and bring in the crops in order to provide for your master's grandson. Meanwhile, Mephibosheth, your master's grandson, will always have a place at my table." (Now Ziba had fifteen sons and 20 servants.)
102Sm 9:11 Later, Ziba said to the king, "Your servant will do everything that your majesty the king commands him." So Mephibosheth ate at David's table like one of the king's sons. 
102Sm 9:12 Mephibosheth fathered a son named Mica, and everyone who lived in Ziba's house became Mephibosheth's servants. 
102Sm 9:13 Mephibosheth continued to live in Jerusalem, always eating at the king's table, since he was maimed in both feet.912
102Sm 10:1 Sometime later, the Ammonite king died and his son Hanun succeeded him as king, 
102Sm 10:2 so David said to himself, "I will be loyal to Nahash's son Hanun, since in his loyalty his father showed gracious love to me." So David sent a delegation to Hanun to console him about his loss of his father. But when David's delegation arrived in Ammonite territory, 
102Sm 10:3 the Ammonite officials asked their lord Hanun, "Do you think that because David has sent a delegation of consolers to you that he is honoring your father?His delegation has arrived intending to search, scout the land, and then overthrow it, hasn't it?" 
102Sm 10:4 So Hanun arrested David's delegation, shaved off half of their beards, cut off their clothes at the waist line, and sent them away in disgrace.3
102Sm 10:5 When David had been informed about the incident, he sent word to them, since the men had been deeply humiliated. The king told them, "Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return."
102Sm 10:6 When the Ammonites realized that they had created quite a stink with David, they hired 20,000 Aramean mercenaries from Beth-rehob and Zobah, along with the king of Maacah and 1,000 men, and 12,000 men from Tob. 
102Sm 10:7 In response, David sent out Joab and his entire army of elite soldiers. 
102Sm 10:8 The Ammonites went out in battle formation at the entrance to the city gate, while the Arameans from Zobah and Rehob, along with the army from Tob and Maacah, were out by themselves in the open fields.
102Sm 10:9 When Joab observed that the battle lines were set up to oppose him both in front and behind, he appointed the best troops in Israel and arrayed them to oppose the Arameans, 
102Sm 10:10 putting the rest of his forces under the command of his brother Abishai, who arrayed them to oppose the Ammonites. 
102Sm 10:11 He said, "If the Arameans prove too strong for me, then you are to help me. If the Ammonites prove too strong for you, then I will come help you. 
102Sm 10:12 Be strong, be courageous on behalf of our people and for the cities of our God, and may the Lord do what he thinks is best."
102Sm 10:13 So Joab and the soldiers who were with him attacked the Arameans in battle formation, and the Arameans retreated in front of him. 
102Sm 10:14 When the Ammonites saw the Arameans retreating, they also retreated from Abishai back to the city. Then Joab broke off his attack against the Ammonites and went back to Jerusalem. 
102Sm 10:15 After the Arameans realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they regrouped. 
102Sm 10:16 Hadadezer sent for the Arameans who lived beyond the Euphrates River, and they set out for Helam, with Shobach leading them as commander of Hadadezer's army.
102Sm 10:17 When David learned this, he mustered all of Israel, crossed the Jordan River, and approached Helam. The Arameans assembled in battle array to attack David, and started their assault. 
102Sm 10:18 But the Arameans retreated from Israel, and David's forces killed 700 of their charioteers, 40,000 soldiers, and mortally wounded Shobach, the commander of their army. As a result, Shobach died there. 
102Sm 10:19 When all the kings who were allied with Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sought terms of peace with the Israelites and became subservient to them. Furthermore, the Arameans were afraid to help the Ammonites any more.10
102Sm 11:1 One spring day, during the time of year when kings go off to war, David sent out Joab, along with his personal staff and all of Israel's army. They utterly destroyed the Ammonites and then attacked Rabbah while David remained in Jerusalem. 
102Sm 11:2 Late one afternoon about dusk, David got up from his couch and was walking around on the roof of the royal palace. From there he watched a woman taking a bath, and she was very beautiful to look at.
102Sm 11:3 David sent word to inquire about her, and someone told him, "This is Eliam's daughter Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah the Hittite, isn't it?" 
102Sm 11:4 So David sent some messengers, took her from her home, and she went to him, and he had sex with her. (She had been consecrating herself following her menstrual separation.) Then she returned to her home.
102Sm 11:5 The woman conceived, and she sent this message to David£º "I'm pregnant."
102Sm 11:6 So David summoned Joab, and told him, "Send me Uriah the Hittite." So Joab sent Uriah to David. 
102Sm 11:7 When Uriah arrived, David inquired about how Joab was doing, how the army was doing, and how the war was progressing.6
102Sm 11:8 Then David told Uriah, "Go on down to your house and relax a while." So Uriah left the king's palace, and the king sent a gift along after him. 
102Sm 11:9 But Uriah spent the night sleeping in the alcove of the king's palace in the company of all his master's staff members. He refused to go down to his own home.
102Sm 11:10 When David was told that Uriah hadn't gone home the previous night, he quizzed him, "You just arrived from a long journey, so why didn't you go down to your own house?"
102Sm 11:11 Uriah replied, "The ark, along with Israel and Judah, are encamped in tents, while my commanding officer Joab and my master's staff members are camping out in the open fields. Should I go home, eat, drink, and have sex with my wife?Not on your life! I won't do something like this, will I?"
102Sm 11:12 Then David invited Uriah, "Stay here today, and tomorrow I'll send you back." So Uriah remained in Jerusalem all that day and the next. 
102Sm 11:13 Then at David's invitation, he and Uriah dined and drank wine together, and David got him drunk. Later that evening, Uriah went out to lie on a couch in the company of his lord's servants, and he did not go down to his house. 
102Sm 11:14 The next morning, David sent a message to Joab that Uriah took with him in his hand. 
102Sm 11:15 In the message, he wrote£º "Assign Uriah to the most difficult fighting at the battle front, and then withdraw from him so that he will be struck down and killed." 
102Sm 11:16 So as Joab began to attack the city, he assigned Uriah to a place where he knew valiant men would be stationed. 
102Sm 11:17 When the men of the city came out to fight Joab, some of David's army staff members fell, and Uriah the Hittite died, too.
102Sm 11:18 Then Joab sent word to David about everything that had happened at the battle. 
102Sm 11:19 He instructed the courier, "When you have finished conveying all the news about the battle to the king, 
102Sm 11:20 if the king starts to get angry and asks you, 'Why did you get so near the city to fight?Didn't you know they would shoot from the wall?
102Sm 11:21 Who killed Jerubbesheth's son Abimelech?Didn't a woman kill him by throwing an upper millstone on him from the wall at Thebez?Why did you go so close to the wall?' then tell him, 'Your servant Uriah the Hittite also died.'"11
102Sm 11:22 So the messenger left Joab, set out for Jerusalem, and disclosed to David everything that Joab had sent him to say. 
102Sm 11:23 The messenger said to David, "The men surprised us and attacked us in the field, but we drove them back to the entrance of the city gate. 
102Sm 11:24 Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall. Some of the king's staff members are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite has died as well."
102Sm 11:25 David responded to the messenger, "Here's what you're to tell Joab£º 'Don't be troubled by this incident, because the battle sword consumes one or another from time to time. Consolidate your attack against the city and conquer it.' Be sure to encourage him."
102Sm 11:26 When Uriah's wife heard about the death of her husband Uriah, she went into mourning for the head of her household. 
102Sm 11:27 When her mourning period was completed, David sent for her, brought her to his palace, and she became his wife. Later on, she bore him a son. Meanwhile, what David had done grieved the Lord, 
102Sm 12:1 so the Lord sent Nathan to David. Nathan approached David and said, "There are two men in the city. One is rich and one is poor. 
102Sm 12:2 The rich man has many flocks and herds, 
102Sm 12:3 but the poor man had nothing except for one little ewe lamb that he had bought. He raised it, and it grew up with him and his children. It used to share his food and drink from his own cup. It even slept in his arms. It was like a daughter to him. 
102Sm 12:4 A traveler arrived to visit the rich man. Because he was unwilling to take an animal from one of his own flocks or herds to prepare for the guest who had come to visit him, he took the poor man's lamb and prepared it for the man who had come to visit him."
102Sm 12:5 David flew into a rage at the man and told Nathan, "As the Lord lives, the man who did this deserves to die! 
102Sm 12:6 He will restore the lamb four times its value, because he did this thing, and because he did it without compassion."
102Sm 12:7 But Nathan replied to David, "You are the man! This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º "'I anointed you king - and you became king over Israel. "'I delivered you from Saul's control.
102Sm 12:8 "'I gave you your former master's household. "'I placed your former master's wives right in your arms. "'I gave you Israel and Judah. "'And if this had been too little, I would have added much more than that to you!
102Sm 12:9 "'Why did you despise what the Lord has promised by doing what is detestable in his sight?"'You struck down Uriah the Hittite with a battle sword. "'You took his wife to be your own. "'You killed him with the sword of the Ammonite army.
102Sm 12:10 "'Therefore the sword will never leave your household, because you have despised me by taking the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your own.'
102Sm 12:11 "This is what the Lord says£º "'Listen very carefully! "'I'm raising up evil against you right out of your own household. "'I'm going to take your wives away from you right before your eyes. "'Then I'll give them to your neighbor. "'And then he's going to have sex with your wives in broad daylight!
102Sm 12:12 "'What you did in secret I'm going to do right in front of all Israel and in broad daylight as well!'"
102Sm 12:13 At this point, David said to Nathan, "I have sinned against the Lord." Nathan responded to David, "There's one other thing£º the Lord has forgiven your sin. You won't die. 
102Sm 12:14 Nevertheless, because you have despised the Lord's enemies with utter contempt, the son born to you will most certainly die." 
102Sm 12:15 Then Nathan went home. After this, the Lord afflicted the child that Uriah's wife had born to David, and the child became very ill. 
102Sm 12:16 David begged God on behalf of the youngster. He fasted, went inside, and spent the night lying on the ground. 
102Sm 12:17 His closest advisors at the palace got up, remained with him, and tried to help him get up from the ground, but he would not do so. He also wouldn't eat with them.
102Sm 12:18 A week later, the child died, and David's staff was afraid to tell him that the child had died. They were telling themselves, "Look, when the child was still alive, we talked to him but he wouldn't listen to what we said. Now what kind of trouble will he bring on himself if we tell him that the child has died?"
102Sm 12:19 But as David observed his staff whispering together, he perceived that the child had died, so he asked his staff, "Is the child dead?" They replied, "He has died."
102Sm 12:20 At this, David got up from the ground, washed, anointed himself, changed his clothes, and went into the Lord's tabernacle to worship. Then he went back to his palace where, at his request, they served him food and he ate.
102Sm 12:21 His staff asked him, "What's this about?When the child was alive, you fasted and cried. Now that the child has died, you get up and eat!"
102Sm 12:22 He answered, "When the child was alive, I fasted and cried. I asked myself, 'Who knows?Maybe the Lord will show grace to me and the child will live.' 
102Sm 12:23 But now that he has died, what's the point of fasting?Can I bring him back again?I'll be going to be with him, but he won't be returning to me."
102Sm 12:24 Then David consoled his wife Bath-sheba. He went in and had sex with her, and she bore a son whom he named Solomon. The Lord loved him, 
102Sm 12:25 and sent a message written by Nathan the prophet to call his name Jedidiah, for the Lord's sake.12
102Sm 12:26 Meanwhile, Joab attacked the Ammonite city of Rabbah and captured its stronghold. 
102Sm 12:27 Then Joab sent messengers to David to tell him, "I just attacked Rabbah and captured its municipal water supply, 
102Sm 12:28 so call out the rest of the army, attack the city, and capture it. Otherwise, I'll take the city myself and name it after me." 
102Sm 12:29 So David mustered his entire army and marched on Rabbah, attacked it, and captured it. 
102Sm 12:30 He confiscated the crown of their king from his head - it weighed 75 pounds in gold and was set with precious stones - and it was placed on David's head. He confiscated a great amount of war booty that had been plundered from the city, 
102Sm 12:31 brought back the people who had lived in it, placing them under conscripted labor with saws, iron picks, and axes. He did this to every Ammonite city, and then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem
102Sm 13:1 Sometime after this, David's son Amnon fell in love with David's other son Absalom's beautiful sister Tamar. 
102Sm 13:2 Amnon became so emotionally distressed that he fell sick over his half-sister Tamar. She was a virgin, and Amnon found it difficult to do anything to her.
102Sm 13:3 Meanwhile, Amnon had a friend named Jonadab, who was the son of David's brother Shimeah. Now Jonadab was a very shrewd man. 
102Sm 13:4 "Why are you so depressed these past few mornings," Jonadab asked Amnon, "since you're a son of the king?Why not tell me?" Amnon replied, "I'm in love with my brother Absalom's sister Tamar."
102Sm 13:5 Jonadab advised him, "Lie down and fake being sick. When your father visits you, ask him, 'Please let my sister Tamar come and give me something to eat that she prepares especially for me, and after she makes dinner for me, let her feed it to me personally.'"
102Sm 13:6 So Amnon lay down and faked being sick. When the king came to visit him, Amnon asked the king, "Please let my sister Tamar come and make some of her bread especially for me, so she can feed it to me personally."
102Sm 13:7 So David sent for Tamar back at the palace, telling her, "Please go to your brother Amnon's home and prepare some food for him." 
102Sm 13:8 Tamar went to her brother Amnon's home, where he was lying down. She brought along some dough, kneaded it, prepared some cakes especially for him, baked them, 
102Sm 13:9 and emptied the baking skillet just for him, but he refused to eat. "Send everybody out of here," Amnon said. So everyone left the room. 
102Sm 13:10 Amnon told Tamar, "Bring the food into my private bedroom, so I can eat it with you personally." So Tamar took the cakes she had prepared and brought them into the private bedroom for her brother Amnon.
102Sm 13:11 But as soon as she brought them near him to eat, he overpowered her and told her, "Come here and have sex with me, my sister!"
102Sm 13:12 "No, my brother!" she kept telling him. "Don't humiliate me like this! This just isn't done in Israel! Don't do this utterly foolish thing! 
102Sm 13:13 And what about me?Where will I go to escape this disgrace?And as for you, you'll be known as one of Israel's greatest fools! So please talk to the king, because he won't withhold me from you!"
102Sm 13:14 But he was unwilling to listen to what she was saying. Since he was stronger than she was, he forced her into having sex with him. 
102Sm 13:15 Afterwards, though, Amnon hated her very intensely. As a result, his hatred for her exceeded the love that he had previously for her. So Amnon told her, "Get up! Leave!"
102Sm 13:16 Even so, she tried to tell him, "No! After all, it's more wrong to send me away than what you just did to me!" But he was unwilling to listen to her. 
102Sm 13:17 So he called out to a young man who was serving him, and told him£º "Send this woman away from me and lock the door after her."
102Sm 13:18 Now she was clothed in a long sleeved, multi-colored ornamental tunic, commonly worn by the king's virgin daughters. When Amnon's servant threw her out and locked the door after her, 
102Sm 13:19 Tamar rubbed her head with ashes, tore her tunic that she was wearing, put her hand to her head, and ran off, crying aloud as she went away.
102Sm 13:20 Later, her brother Absalom asked her, "Has Amnon, that brother of yours, raped you?Then keep quiet about your half-brother for now, my sister. Stop taking this so personally." From that time on, Tamar lived in continual desolation within her brother Absalom's house. 
102Sm 13:21 When King David heard all about these developments, he flew into a rage over it. 
102Sm 13:22 But Absalom never said a word, either god or bad, to Amnon. Nevertheless, he hated Amnon because he had humiliated his sister Tamar.
102Sm 13:23 Two full years later, Absalom took some men to Baal-hazor near Ephraim to shear his sheep. He also invited all of the king's sons to come. 
102Sm 13:24 Absalom had gone to the king to ask him, "I've brought some men to shear the sheep. Won't you please come and join me, along with your senior staff?"
102Sm 13:25 But King David declined, saying to Absalom, "No, my son, we won't all go, since that would be too much trouble for you." Although Absalom begged David, he would not go, even though he did give his blessing.
102Sm 13:26 So Absalom responded, "If you aren't coming, please allow my brother Amnon to accompany us." The king asked, "Why should he go with you?"
102Sm 13:27 But Absalom kept begging David until he sent Amnon and all of David's sons to accompany Absalom.
102Sm 13:28 Then Absalom instructed his young men, "Please keep watching Amnon until he's drunk. Then I'll tell you, 'Attack Amnon!' As soon as I do, kill him and don't be afraid! You have your orders, so be strong and brave!" 
102Sm 13:29 So Absalom's young men did to Amnon just as they had been ordered, but the rest of David's sons jumped up, mounted their mules, and escaped.
102Sm 13:30 While they were still on the road, this rumor came to David£º "Absalom has struck down all of the king's sons and none of them has survived." 
102Sm 13:31 David arose, ripped his clothes in anguish, and collapsed to the ground while all of his staff stood by with their own clothes torn.
102Sm 13:32 But David's brother Shimeah's son Jonadab reported, "Your majesty, don't assume they've killed all of the young men - the king's sons - only Amnon has died, since that was Absalom's intention from the day Amnon raped his sister Tamar. 
102Sm 13:33 Now your majesty, don't be concerned about this rumor that all the king's sons have died, because only Amnon is dead."1332
102Sm 13:34 Meanwhile, Absalom had run away. While the young man standing watch was looking around, all of a sudden he observed many people coming down the road behind and to the west of the mountain! So the watchman left his post and reported, "I have seen men coming from the direction of Horonaim."
102Sm 13:35 Jonadab told the king, "Look! Here come the king's sons. This thing has turned out just like your servant reported." 
102Sm 13:36 Just as he finished his comments, the king's sons arrived, crying loudly. At this, with tears overflowing, the king and his entire staff wept bitterly.
102Sm 13:37 Absalom continued to flee, eventually going to Ammihud's son King Talmai of Geshur, while King David continued to mourn for his son every day. 
102Sm 13:38 After fleeing to Geshur, Absalom remained there for three years. 
102Sm 13:39 Meanwhile, King David longed to visit Absalom, since he was moved to compassion over Amnon's death.
102Sm 14:1 Meanwhile, Zeruiah's son Joab knew that the king's attention was focused on Absalom, 
102Sm 14:2 so he sent messengers to Tekoa to bring a wise woman from there. He told her, "Please play the role of a mourner, wear the clothes of a mourner, and refrain from using makeup. Act like a woman who's been in mourning for the dead for many days. 
102Sm 14:3 Then go to the king and speak to him like this¡¦" Then Joab told her what to say.
102Sm 14:4 When the woman from Tekoa spoke to the king, she fell on her face to the ground, prostrating herself to address him, "Help, your majesty!"
102Sm 14:5 The king asked her, "What's your problem?" "I've been a widowed woman ever since my husband died," she answered. 
102Sm 14:6 "Your humble servant used to have two sons, but they got into a fight out in the field. Because there was no one to keep them apart, one of them attacked the other and killed him. 
102Sm 14:7 Now please pay attention closely! My whole family is attacking your humble servant! They're saying, 'Turn over the one who attacked his brother and we'll put him to death in retribution for his brother, whose life he took. That way, we'll kill the heir also!' They're going to extinguish the only light left in my family, leaving my late husband neither an ongoing name nor a survivor on the face of the earth!"
102Sm 14:8 Then the king replied to the woman, "Go home and I'll issue a special order just for you."
102Sm 14:9 But the woman from Tekoa said to the king, "Your majesty, let any guilt for this be on me and on my ancestors' household, and not on my king or his throne!"
102Sm 14:10 The king replied, "Bring anyone who talks to you about this to me, and he certainly won't be bothering you anymore!"
102Sm 14:11 Then she said, "Your majesty, please remember the Lord your God, so that blood avengers don't do any more damage! Otherwise, they'll destroy my son!" So he promised, "As the Lord lives, not even a single hair from your son's head will fall to the ground!"
102Sm 14:12 At this, the woman responded, "Would your majesty the king please allow your humble servant to say one more thing?" "Say it¡¦" he replied.
102Sm 14:13 "Why, then," the woman asked, "are you planning to act just like this against God's people?Based on what your majesty has said, you're acting like one who is guilty himself, because you're not bringing back the one whom you've banished! 
102Sm 14:14 After all, even though we all die, and we're all like water being spilled on the ground that cannot be recovered, nevertheless God doesn't take away life, but carries out his plans so as not to cast away permanently from him those who are presently estranged.
102Sm 14:15 "Now as to why I've come to speak with your majesty the king, it's because the people have made me afraid, so your humble servant said to herself, 'I'll go speak to the king, so perhaps the king will do what his humble servant has requested. 
102Sm 14:16 Perhaps the king will listen and deliver his humble servant from the oppression of the man who intends to eliminate both me and my son from what God has apportioned to us!'
102Sm 14:17 "So your humble servant is saying, 'Please, your majesty, let what the king has to say be of comfort, because just as the angel of God is, so also is your majesty the king to discern both good and evil. And may the Lord your God remain present with you.'"
102Sm 14:18 In reply, the king asked the woman, "Please don't conceal anything about which I'm going to be asking you now." So the woman replied, "Please, your majesty, let the king speak."
102Sm 14:19 Then the king asked, "Is Joab behind all of this with you?" "As your soul lives, your majesty, the king," the woman answered, "no one can divert anything left or right from what your majesty the king has spoken! As a matter of fact, it was your servant Joab! He was there, giving me precise orders about everything that your humble servant was to say. Your servant Joab did this,
102Sm 14:20 intending to change the outcome of this matter. Nevertheless, your majesty is wise, like the wisdom of the angel of God, to be aware of everything that's going on throughout the earth."19
102Sm 14:21 Then the king addressed Joab, "Look! I'll do this thing that you've requested. Go bring back the young man Absalom."
102Sm 14:22 At this, Joab fell on his face to the ground, prostrating himself to bless the king, and then said, "Today your servant realizes that he's found favor with you, your majesty, in that the king has acted on the request of his servant." 
102Sm 14:23 Then Joab got up, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom back to Jerusalem.
102Sm 14:24 Nevertheless, the king said, "Let him return to his own home and not show his face to me." So Absalom returned to his own home and did not show his face to the king. 
102Sm 14:25 Now throughout all of Israel no one was as handsome as Absalom or so highly praised, from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there wasn't a single thing wrong about him. 
102Sm 14:26 Whenever he cut his hair  - he cut it at the end of every year, because it grew thick on his head, which is why he cut it - his hair weighed in at 200 shekels measured by the royal standard. 
102Sm 14:27 Absalom fathered three sons and one daughter, whom he named Tamar. She was a beautiful woman, both in form and appearance.
102Sm 14:28 Meanwhile, Absalom lived in Jerusalem for two years, but never saw the king's face. 
102Sm 14:29 After this, Absalom sent for Joab, intending to send him to the king, but Joab would not come. Absalom sent for him a second time, but he still would not come. 
102Sm 14:30 So Absalom told his servants, "Observe that Joab's grain field lies next to mine. He has barley planted there. Go set it on fire." So Absalom's servants set the field on fire.14
102Sm 14:31 At this, Joab got up, went to Absalom's home, and demanded of him, "Why did your servants set fire to my grain field?"
102Sm 14:32 In answer to Joab, Absalom replied, "Look, I sent for you, telling you 'Come here so I can send you to the king to ask him "What's the point in moving here from Geshur?I would have been better off to have remained there!"' So let me see the king's face, and if I'm guilty of anything, let him execute me!"
102Sm 14:33 So when Joab approached the king and told him what Absalom had said, he summoned Absalom, who then came to the king and fell to the ground on his face in front of him. Then the king kissed Absalom.
102Sm 15:1 Sometime later, Absalom acquired a chariot equipped with horses and recruited 50 men to accompany him. 
102Sm 15:2 Then he would get up early, stand near the passageway to the palace gate, and when anyone arrived to file a legal complaint for a hearing before the king, Absalom would call to him and ask, "You're from what city?" If he replied, "Your servant is from one of Israel's tribes," 
102Sm 15:3 Absalom would respond, "Look, your claims are valid and defensible, but nobody will listen to you on behalf of the king. 
102Sm 15:4 Who will appoint me to be a judge in the land?When anyone arrived to file a legal complaint or other cause, he could approach me for justice and I would settle it!" 
102Sm 15:5 Furthermore, if a man approached him to bow down in front of him, he would put out his hand, grab him, and embrace him. 
102Sm 15:6 By doing all of this to anyone who came to the king for a hearing, Absalom stole the loyalty of the men of Israel.
102Sm 15:7 And so it was that forty years after Israel had demanded a king, Absalom asked the king, "Please let me go to Hebron so I can pay my vow that I made to the Lord, 
102Sm 15:8 because when I was living at Geshur in Aram, your servant made this solemn promise£º 'If the Lord ever brings me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord.'"
102Sm 15:9 The king replied to him, "Go in peace!" So Absalom got up and left for Hebron.
102Sm 15:10 But Absalom sent agents throughout all of the tribes of Israel, telling them, "When you hear the sound of the battle trumpet, you're to announce that Absalom is king in Hebron." 
102Sm 15:11 Meanwhile, 200 men left Jerusalem with Absalom. They had been invited to go along, but were innocent, not knowing anything about what was happening. 
102Sm 15:12 Absalom also sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David's counselor, to come from his home town of Giloh while Absalom was presenting the sacrificial offerings. And so the conspiracy widened, because the common people increasingly sided with Absalom.11
102Sm 15:13 Then a messenger arrived to inform David, "The loyalties of the men of Israel have shifted to Absalom."
102Sm 15:14 So David told all of his staff who were with him in Jerusalem, "Let's get up and get out of here! Otherwise, none of us will escape from Absalom. Hurry, or he'll overtake us quickly, bring disaster on all of us, and execute the inhabitants of the city!"
102Sm 15:15 "Look!" the king's staff replied. "Your servants will do whatever the king chooses." So the king left, taking his entire household with him except for ten mistresses, who were to keep the palace in order. 
102Sm 15:17 The king left, along with all of his people with him, and they paused at the last house. 
102Sm 15:18 All of his staff were going on ahead of him - that is, all of the Cherethites, all of the Pelethites, all of the Gittites, and 600 men who had come to serve him from Gath, went on ahead of the king.17
102Sm 15:19 Then the king suggested to Ittai the Gittite, "Why should you have to go with us?Return and stay with the new king, since you're a foreigner and exile. Stay where you want to stay. 
102Sm 15:20 It seems only yesterday that you arrived, so should I make you wander around with us while I go wherever I can?Go back, and take your brothers with you. May gracious love and truth accompany you!"
102Sm 15:21 "As the Lord lives," Ittai answered in reply, "and as your majesty the king lives, wherever your majesty my king may be - whether living or dying - that's where your servant will be!"
102Sm 15:22 So David replied, "Come along, then!" So Ittai the Gittite went along also, accompanied by all of his men and all of his little ones. 
102Sm 15:23 With all of the people in the territory crying loudly, everybody passed over the Kidron brook, along with the king. Then everyone headed out toward the road that leads to the wilderness.
102Sm 15:24 Meanwhile, Zadok showed up also, along with all of the Levites with him, carrying the ark of the covenant of God. They set down the ark of God and Abiathar approached while all the people finished abandoning the city. 
102Sm 15:25 The king told Zadok, "Take the ark of God back to the city. If I'm shown favor in the Lord's sight, then he'll bring me back again and show me both it and the place where it rests. 
102Sm 15:26 But if he should say something like 'I'm not pleased with you,' well then, here I am - let him do to me whatever seems right to him."
102Sm 15:27 The king also asked Zadok the priest, "Aren't you a seer, too?Go back to the city in comfort, along with your son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan. 
102Sm 15:28 Look! I'll camp at the wilderness fords until you send word to inform me." 
102Sm 15:29 So Zadok and Abiathar returned the ark of God to Jerusalem and remained there. 
102Sm 15:30 David then left, going up the Mount of Olives, crying as he went, with his head covered and his feet bare. All of the people who were with him covered their own heads and climbed up the Mount of Olives, crying as they went along.15
102Sm 15:31 Just then, someone told David, "Ahithophel is one of Absalom's conspirators!" So David prayed, "Lord, please turn Ahithophel's counsel into foolishness."
102Sm 15:32 Just as David was coming to the top of the Mount of Olives where God was being worshiped, there was Hushai the Archite to meet him, with his coat ripped and dust all over his head! 
102Sm 15:33 David greeted him, "If you come along with me, you'll be a burden to me. 
102Sm 15:34 So go back to the city and tell Absalom, 'I'll be your servant, your majesty! Just as I served your father in the past, I can be your servant now.' That way you can manipulate Ahithophel's advice to my benefit. 
102Sm 15:35 Won't Zadok and Abiathar the priests be there with you?So whatever you hear from the king's palace, you're to report to Zadok and Abiathar the priests. 
102Sm 15:36 Their two sons - Zadok's son Ahimaaz and Abiathar's son Jonathan?are with them there. You'll be sending me everything that you hear through them." 
102Sm 15:37 So David's friend Hushai went back to the city just as Absalom was arriving in Jerusalem.
102Sm 16:1 Now just as David happened to have passed the summit of the Mount of Olives, suddenly Mephibosheth's servant Ziba met him, accompanied by a couple of saddled donkeys loaded with 200 loaves of bread, 100 clusters of raisins, 100 pieces of summer fruit, and a skin of wine! 
102Sm 16:2 The king asked Ziba, "What are those for?" Ziba replied, "The donkeys are for the king's household to ride, the bread and summer fruit are for your young men to eat, and the wine is for whoever wants to drink if they get weary in the wilderness."
102Sm 16:3 Then the king asked, "Where is your master's son?" "He's staying in Jerusalem!" Ziba answered the king. "He's saying 'The nation of Israel will restore my father's kingdom to me today!'"
102Sm 16:4 So the king told Ziba, "Pay attention! Everything that belongs to Mephibosheth is now yours!" In response Ziba said, "I'm submitting to you. Let me find favor in your sight, your majesty the king!"
102Sm 16:5 Later on, as King David approached Bahurim, Gera's son Shimei, who was related to the family of Saul's household, went out to meet David, cursing continuously as he came. 
102Sm 16:6 He threw rocks at David and all of David's staff who were accompanying him, while all the rest of the entourage, including all of David's security detail, were close by him. 
102Sm 16:7 "Get out of here! Get out!" Shimei yelled as he cursed. "You murderer! You who think you're above the law! 
102Sm 16:8 The Lord has repaid you personally for murdering the entire dynasty of Saul, whose place you've taken to reign! And the Lord has given the kingdom into your son Absalom's control. Now look! Your own evil has caught up with you, because you're guilty of murder!"
102Sm 16:9 At this point, Zeruiah's son Abishai asked the king, "Why should this dead dog be cursing your majesty the king?May I have permission to go over and cut off his head?"
102Sm 16:10 But the king responded, "What do I have in common with you sons of Zeruiah?If he continues to curse - and if the Lord has told him, 'Curse David!' - then who are you to be demanding to know 'Why have you done this?'"
102Sm 16:11 So David ordered Abishai and all of his staff£º "Look! My own son wants to kill me! How much more now is this Benjaminite?Leave him alone and let him go on cursing, because the Lord has ordered him to do this. 
102Sm 16:12 Perhaps the Lord will take note of my troubles and return good to me instead of curses today!"
102Sm 16:13 So David and his entourage went on their way, and Shimei walked along the hillside with him, cursing, throwing rocks, and tossing dirt at David as they went along. 
102Sm 16:14 Eventually, the king and his entourage arrived exhausted at their destination, and David refreshed himself there.
102Sm 16:15 Right about then, Absalom and his entourage from the people of Israel entered Jerusalem, accompanied by Ahithophel. 
102Sm 16:16 When David's friend Hushai the Archite approached Absalom, Hushai greeted Absalom, "Long live the king! Long live the king!"16
102Sm 16:17 But Absalom asked Hushai, "So this is how you demonstrate your loyalty to your closest friends?Why didn't you leave with your friend?"
102Sm 16:18 Hushai replied, "No! On the contrary, whomever the Lord, this group, and all the men of Israel choose is where I'll be, and I'll remain with him! 
102Sm 16:19 Besides, who else should I be serving?Why not the son?The same way I served your father, I'll serve you."
102Sm 16:20 So Absalom asked Ahithophel, "What's your advice?What should we do?"
102Sm 16:21 Ahithophel responded, "Go inside and have sex with your father's mistresses, whom he left to keep the palace in order. Then everyone in Israel will hear how your father has come to hate you and everyone who has joined you will be emboldened to act." 
102Sm 16:22 So they erected a tent for Absalom on the palace roof and Absalom went in and had sex with his father's mistresses right in front of all Israel.
102Sm 16:23 Now Ahithophel's advice that he provided at that time was being compared to one who inquired of God, so highly regarded was Ahithophel's counsel by both David and Absalom. 
102Sm 17:1 "Give me 12,000 men! I'll leave tonight and pursue David," Ahithophel advised Absalom. 
102Sm 17:2 "I'll catch him while he is still tired and weak. I'll frighten him so all his people with him desert him. But I'll only kill the king. 
102Sm 17:3 Then I'll bring everybody else back to you. When the man you're looking for is dead, all the rest of the people will return quietly."
102Sm 17:4 Even though this plan seemed like a good idea to Absalom and to all of the elders of Israel, 
102Sm 17:5 Absalom replied, "Call in Hushai the Archite so I can hear what he has to say, too!" 
102Sm 17:6 When Hushai approached Absalom, Absalom asked him, "Here's what Ahithophel had to advise. Should we do what he says?Or if not, say so!"
102Sm 17:7 "Ahithophel's advice is not best at this time," Hushai suggested to Absalom. 
102Sm 17:8 "You know how strong your father and his men are. They're as mad as a bear robbed of her cubs! Furthermore, your father is a skilled warrior. He won't stay with his army at night. 
102Sm 17:9 Look! He's probably already hiding in a cave or someplace like that. If the first attack fails, people will hear about it and think, 'Absalom's army is losing!' 
102Sm 17:10 Then even men who would otherwise be as brave as lions will be scared, because every Israelite knows your father is a mighty man, and they know his men are valiant! 
102Sm 17:11 So here's my advice£º Muster everybody from one end of the country to the other! You'll have an army in number like the sand on the seashore! Then you'll go into battle! 
102Sm 17:12 We'll go find David wherever he's hiding. We'll fall on him like dew on the ground! We'll kill him and all of his men, and we won't leave even one man alive! 
102Sm 17:13 If he escapes into a city, we'll bring ropes to that city and tear it down! We won't leave a single stone left in the valley!"11
102Sm 17:14 Absalom and all of the Israelites replied, "The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than Ahithophel's!" But the Lord had planned to circumvent the sound advice of Ahithophel so the Lord could bring Absalom to destruction. 
102Sm 17:15 So Hushai told Zadok and Abiathar, the priests, what Ahithophel had suggested to Absalom and the elders of Israel. He also reported what he himself had proposed. Hushai said, 
102Sm 17:16 "Quick! Get word to David! Tell him not to spend the night at the crossings that lead to the desert. Instead, he must cross the Jordan River immediately. That way, if he crosses the river, the king and his entourage will survive."
102Sm 17:17 Meanwhile, since they could not risk being seen entering the city, Jonathan and Ahimaaz had been waiting at En-rogel, where a young servant woman was to go to inform them and they would then go brief King David. 
102Sm 17:18 But a young man observed Jonathan and Ahimaaz and informed Absalom, so they left in a hurry, arrived at the home of a man who lived at Bahurim, and hid inside a well that was in his courtyard. 
102Sm 17:19 The man's wife grabbed a sheet, covered the mouth of the well with it, and spread some dried grain over it. As a result, nobody could tell it was a hiding place.18
102Sm 17:20 When Absalom's servants approached the woman of the house, they asked her, "Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?" "They've already crossed the brook," the woman answered. So Absalom's servants went away in search of Jonathan and Ahimaaz, but they couldn't find them, so they returned to Jerusalem.
102Sm 17:21 A little while later, the men crawled up out of the well and went off to talk to King David. They told David, "Get up! Cross the water quickly, because this is what Ahithophel advised about you¡¦" 
102Sm 17:22 So David got up and all of his entourage crossed the Jordan River. Everyone had crossed the Jordan River by dawn's first light.
102Sm 17:23 Meanwhile, when Ahithophel observed that his counsel was not being acted upon, he saddled his donkey, got up, and left for his hometown. Leaving behind a set of orders for his household, he hanged himself. After his death he was buried in his father's tomb.
102Sm 17:24 Later, David arrived at Mahanaim. Absalom and all of the Israelites who supported him crossed the Jordan River. 
102Sm 17:25 Absalom had installed Amasa in place of Joab over the army. (Amasa was the son of a man named Jether the Ishmaelite. His mother was Abigail, a daughter of Nahash and a sister of Zeruiah, Joab's mother.) 
102Sm 17:26 Absalom and the Israelites with him camped in the territory of Gilead. 
102Sm 17:27 When David arrived at Mahanaim, Shobi (Nahash's son from the Ammonite town of Rabbah), Makir (Ammiel's son from Lo-debar), and Barzillai (from Rogelim in Gilead) were already there. 
102Sm 17:28 They brought along bedding, bowls, clay basins, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grains, beans, peas, 
102Sm 17:29 honey, cheeses, sheep, and cheese made from cow's milk for David and his entourage because they had been reasoning, "The people are hungry, tired, and thirsty there in the wilderness."
102Sm 18:1 David mustered his forces and appointed officers in charge of regiments and companies. 
102Sm 18:2 Dividing his forces into three groups, he set Joab as commander of one third of his army, Zeruiah's son Abishai, Joab's brother, as commander of another third, and Ittai from Gath as commander of another third. The king informed the army, "I'm going out to battle with you, too."
102Sm 18:3 "No way!" his army responded. "If we have to retreat from the battle, Absalom's men won't care about us. Even if half of us die, they won't care about us. But you are worth 10,000 of us. The best thing you can do for us is to remain in the city."
102Sm 18:4 So David responded, "I'll do what you think best." Then he stood alongside the city gate as the army went out in battle array by hundreds and thousands. 
102Sm 18:5 As they were going out, the king ordered Joab, Abishai, and Ittai, "Treat young Absalom gently for my sake." Everyone heard what the king had ordered his commanders about Absalom.
102Sm 18:6 David's army left for the battlefield to fight Absalom and his Israelite followers, and they also fought in the Ephraim forest, 
102Sm 18:7 where David's army of servants defeated the Israelites. Many died that day - 20,000 men. 
102Sm 18:8 The battle spread throughout the entire countryside, and the forest claimed more casualties that day than did the sword fighting.
102Sm 18:9 Absalom happened to run into David's soldiers. While Absalom was trying to get away on his mule, it ran under the thick branches of a giant oak tree, and Absalom's head got caught in the tree! As his mule ran out from under him, Absalom was left hanging above the ground. 
102Sm 18:10 When one of the soldiers saw what had happened, he told Joab, "I saw Absalom stuck in an oak tree!"9
102Sm 18:11 Joab asked the man who was reporting to him, "What! You saw him?Why didn't you kill him right then and there?I would've given you ten pieces of silver and a warrior's sash!"
102Sm 18:12 But the soldier replied to Joab, "I wouldn't have touched the king's son even if you dropped 1,000 pieces of silver right into my hands, because we heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, 'Watch how you treat the young man Absalom!' 
102Sm 18:13 If I had taken his life, the king would have uncovered everything about it, and you would never have protected me!"12
102Sm 18:14 "There's no reason to wait for you!" Joab retorted. Then he took three spears in his hand and stabbed Absalom in the heart while he was still alive, dangling from the branches of the oak tree. 
102Sm 18:15 Ten young men who served as Joab's personal assistants then surrounded Absalom, striking him repeatedly and killing him. 
102Sm 18:16 At this, Joab sounded his battle trumpet and his troops stopped pursuing the other Israelites. 
102Sm 18:17 Meanwhile, Joab's army grabbed Absalom's body, tossed it into a large pit in the forest, and filled it up with a huge pile of rocks. Then the Israelites ran away back to their homes.
102Sm 18:18 While Absalom had been living, he had erected a pillar as a monument to himself in King's Valley because he had been telling himself, "I don't have a son to carry on my family name." So he named the pillar after himself - it's called Absalom's Monument even today.
102Sm 18:19 Zadok's son Ahimaaz told Joab, "Let me run over to King David and take him the news. I'll mention that the Lord has delivered him from his enemies."
102Sm 18:20 But Joab answered Ahimaaz, "You're not the man to deliver news today. Do it any other time, but not today, because the king's son is dead." 
102Sm 18:21 So Joab ordered a man from Ethiopia, "Go tell the king what you've seen." So the Ethiopian saluted Joab and then ran to tell David.
102Sm 18:22 "Please," Zadok's son Ahimaaz continued, "No matter what happens, let me follow the Ethiopian!" Joab asked him, "Why this request to run, my son?There's no reward in it for you."
102Sm 18:23 "No matter what, I'm running," Ahimaaz replied. So Joab told Ahimaaz, "Run!" And Ahimaaz ran, taking the Jordan Valley road, passing the Ethiopian.
102Sm 18:24 Meanwhile, David was sitting between the inner and outer gates of the city. The watchman was up on the roof of the gateway near the walls, looking around, and there was a man running by himself! 
102Sm 18:25 So the watchman called out his news to the king. The king responded, "If he's alone, he's bringing some news to report." As the man continued to draw near and approach the palace, 
102Sm 18:26 the watchman observed another man running. So he called out to the gatekeeper, "There's another man running by himself!" The king replied, "He's also bringing some news to report!"
102Sm 18:27 Then the watchman observed, "It looks to me that the runner out in front is running like Zadok's son Ahimaaz!" The king replied, "This is a good man bearing good news!"
102Sm 18:28 "Everything's fine!" Ahimaaz announced to the king. He bowed low with his face to the ground before the king and said, "Praise be to the Lord your God! He has handed over the men who rebelled against your majesty the king."
102Sm 18:29 "Are things fine with respect to the young man Absalom?" the king asked. Ahimaaz answered, "I saw a lot of confusion about the time Joab was getting ready to send the king's courier and me, your servant, but I'm not sure what was going on."
102Sm 18:30 The king replied, "Stand here at attention and wait." So he stepped to the side and stood there waiting.
102Sm 18:31 Just then the Ethiopian arrived. He reported, "Good news, your majesty the king! The Lord has delivered you from the control of everyone who rebelled against you!"
102Sm 18:32 The king asked the Ethiopian, "Is the young man safe?" The Ethiopian answered, "May the enemies of your majesty the king - including everyone who rebels and tries to harm you - become like that young man¡¦."
102Sm 18:33 Deeply shaken, the king went up to the chamber overlooking the city gate, weeping bitterly and crying out as he went along, "My son Absalom! My son! My son Absalom! I wish I had died instead of you, Absalom my son, my son!"
102Sm 19:1 Someone informed Joab, "The king is weeping bitterly, mourning for Absalom." 
102Sm 19:2 The victory had became an occasion for the army to mourn, because on that very day the troops heard the announcement, "The king is grieving for his son!" 
102Sm 19:3 So men snuck into the city that day like men do who are ashamed after they've run away from a battle.
102Sm 19:4 Meanwhile, the king veiled his face and kept on crying loudly, "My son Absalom! Absalom my son, my son!"
102Sm 19:5 Joab went up to the palace and rebuked the king£º "Today you've humiliated your entire army who just saved your life, the lives of your sons and daughters, and the lives of your wives and mistresses! 
102Sm 19:6 You love those who hate you and hate those who love you! You've made it abundantly clear today that your officers and the men under them mean nothing to you! I've learned today that you would rather have Absalom alive today and all the rest of us dead! 
102Sm 19:7 Now get up and restore the morale of your army. I swear by the Lord that if you don't get out there, you won't have a single man left in your army by nightfall! You'll be in more trouble today than all the disasters you've been through from your boyhood until now!" 
102Sm 19:8 So the king got up and took his seat in the gateway. When the army was informed, "The king is sitting in the gateway!" they all gathered together in his presence. Meanwhile, the Israelites had run away back to their own homes. 
102Sm 19:9 Throughout the tribes of Israel, everyone was quarreling with one another£º "The king delivered us from the domination of our enemies¡¦." "He's the one who rescued us from Philistine control¡¦." "Now he's fleeing the country because of Absalom¡¦!"
102Sm 19:10 "The very same Absalom we anointed to rule just died in battle¡¦!" "Now then, why remain silent about bringing the king back¡¦?"
102Sm 19:11 So King David sent this message to Zadok and Abiathar, the priests£º "Ask the elders of Judah, 'Why are you the last to bring the king back to his palace, considering that what's being reported throughout all of Israel has come to the king at his palace?
102Sm 19:12 You're my relatives! You're my own flesh and blood! So why are you the last to bring back the king?' 
102Sm 19:13 Then ask Amasa, 'Aren't you my own flesh and blood?So may God deal with me, no matter how severely, if from this day forward you don't take Joab's place as commander of my army.'
102Sm 19:14 By doing things like this, he persuaded all the men of Judah to unite in support of him. They sent the king this message£º "Come on back, you and all of your army!" 
102Sm 19:15 So the king returned to Israel as far as the Jordan River. The men of Judah went out as far as Gilgal to greet the king and escort him across the Jordan River 
102Sm 19:16 while Gera's son Shimei, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, accompanied them to meet King David. 
102Sm 19:17 Ziba, the steward in charge of Saul's household, and 1,000 Benjaminites accompanied him, along with Ziba's fifteen sons and 20 servants. They rushed toward the Jordan River ahead of the king 
102Sm 19:18 and forded it to assist the king at the crossing so he could do whatever he wished. Just as the king was about to ford the Jordan River, Gera's son Shimei fell down in front of the king 
102Sm 19:19 and addressed him, "May your majesty not hold me guilty. Don't remember how your servant did wrong the day your majesty the king left Jerusalem. May the king not let it burden his heart, 
102Sm 19:20 because your servant knows that I have sinned, but today I have come here as the first one from the entire house of Joseph to meet your majesty the king."
102Sm 19:21 But Zeruiah's son Abishai asked, "Why shouldn't Shimei be put to death for this?After all, he cursed the Lord's anointed!"
102Sm 19:22 David replied, "What do you sons of Zeruiah have in common with me?You've become my enemies today! Should anyone be executed in Israel today?Don't you know that I've been reinstated as king over Israel today?" 
102Sm 19:23 Then the king addressed Shimei, "You won't die!" affirming his promise with an oath.
102Sm 19:24 Meanwhile, Saul's grandson Mephibosheth also went out to greet the king. He had not taken care of his feet, trimmed his mustache, or washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned safely. 
102Sm 19:25 When he arrived from Jerusalem to greet the king, the king asked him, "So why didn't you come with me, Mephibosheth?"
102Sm 19:26 He replied, "Well, your majesty, since your servant is lame, I told myself, 'I'll have my donkey saddled and I'll ride on it so I can leave with the king.' But my servant Ziba deceived me 
102Sm 19:27 by slandering your servant to your majesty. But your majesty the king is like an angel from God£º so do what you think is best. 
102Sm 19:28 Everyone from my grandfather's household deserved nothing but death from your majesty the king, but you provided a place for your servant among those who have been eating from your table. So what right do I have to ask for anything more from the king?"
102Sm 19:29 In response, the king told him, "What's the point of us talking any more?My decision is that you and Ziba divide the fields."
102Sm 19:30 But Mephibosheth told the king, "Let him take all of it, now that your majesty the king has returned safely to his palace."
102Sm 19:31 Barzillai the Gileadite also had come down from Rogelim to cross the Jordan River with the king and to see him on his way from there. 
102Sm 19:32 Now Barzillai was a very old man at the age of 80 years. A very wealthy man, Barzillai had provided for king David during his sojourn in Mahanaim. 
102Sm 19:33 So the king invited Barzillai, "Cross the Jordan River with me, live with me in Jerusalem, and I'll provide for you there."32
102Sm 19:34 "How many more years do I have to live," Barzillai replied to the king, "that I should move to Jerusalem with the king?
102Sm 19:35 I'm now 80 years old! I can hardly tell the difference between what tastes good or bad! I can't tell what I eat or drink! I can't hear the voice of men and women when they sing! So why should your servant be an added burden to your majesty the king?
102Sm 19:36 Your servant will cross the Jordan River with the king for a short distance, but why should the king offer me this reward?
102Sm 19:37 Please let your servant return so I can die in my own home town near the grave of my father and mother. Meanwhile, here is your servant Chimham! Let him accompany your majesty the king. Please do for him whatever seems best to you."
102Sm 19:38 So the king answered, "Chimham will accompany me, and I'll do for him whatever seems best to you! I'll do anything for you that you want!" 
102Sm 19:39 Then all the people crossed the Jordan River, followed by the king. The king embraced Barzillai, blessed him, and then Barzillai returned to his home. 
102Sm 19:40 As the king crossed over the Jordan River to Gilgal, Chimham accompanied him, as did all the troops of Judah and half the troops of Israel.
102Sm 19:41 Not long afterward, all the men of Israel started coming to the king, complaining to him, "Why did our relatives in Judah's army sneak you away, taking the king and his household over the Jordan River, along with David's army?"19
102Sm 19:42 Everybody from Judah shouted to the men from Israel, "We did this because the king is closely related to us. So why are you angry about this?Have we lived off the king's expense?Have we appropriated anything for ourselves?"
102Sm 19:43 But the men from Israel answered the men from Judah£º "We represent ten of the tribes of Israel! So we have more right to David than you do! Why haven't you taken us seriously?Weren't we the first to talk about bringing back our king?" But what the people of Judah had to say was harsher than what the people of Israel were saying.19
102Sm 20:1 Right about then, Bicri's son Sheba, an ungodly man from the tribe of Benjamin, sounded a battle trumpet and announced£º We've never been a part of David! We'll never gain anything from Jesse's son! It's every man to his tent, Israel!
102Sm 20:2 So all of the other Israelite soldiers abandoned David to follow Bicri's son Sheba, while the army of Judah remained with the king all the way from the Jordan River to Jerusalem.
102Sm 20:3 When David arrived at his palace in Jerusalem, the king took the ten mistresses whom he had left behind to keep the palace in order and placed them in a separate house, providing for them under the care of a protective guard. He never visited them again, so they were under care until they died, living as if their husbands had died.
102Sm 20:4 Meanwhile, David ordered Amasa, "Muster the army of Judah here within three days, and be here yourself!"
102Sm 20:5 But when Amasa went out to muster the army of Judah, he delayed to act within the time allotted to him. 
102Sm 20:6 So David said to Abishai, "Now Bicri's son Sheba is about to do more damage than did Absalom. So take my personal guards and go after them. Otherwise, he'll run to one of the fortified cities and escape from us." 
102Sm 20:7 So Joab's men, the Cherithites, the Pelethites, and all of David's elite forces left Jerusalem in pursuit of Bicri's son Sheba.
102Sm 20:8 When they arrived at the great stone that is in Gibeon, Amasa came out to meet them. Joab was dressed in a soldier's uniform, over which was a belt that fastened a sword sheath to his thigh. As he walked forward, the sword was exposed. 
102Sm 20:9 Joab asked Amasa, "Is everything going well with you, my brother?" As Joab took Amasa by his beard to greet him, 
102Sm 20:10 Amasa did not notice the sword that Joab was holding in his hand. Joab stabbed him in the abdomen, spilling his intestines to the ground in a single stroke and killing him. After this, Joab and his brother pursued Bicri's son Sheba.8
102Sm 20:11 One of Joab's soldiers stood by Amasa while he lay dying and announced, "Whoever is in favor of Joab and David, let him follow Joab." 
102Sm 20:12 While Amasa lay wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway, everybody who passed by was stopping to stare at him, so when the soldier saw that all of the army was stopping, he carried Amasa off the highway into a nearby field and covered him with a garment. 
102Sm 20:13 After Amasa had been removed from the highway, the rest of the army followed Joab in pursuit of Bichri's son Sheba.
102Sm 20:14 Meanwhile, Sheba traveled throughout the tribes of Israel in the direction of Abel and Beth-maacah, and all of the Berites gathered together and followed him inside. 
102Sm 20:15 All of the men who had accompanied Joab arrived and besieged Sheba in Abel of Beth-maacah. They threw up a siege ramp against the city rampart and began to batter the wall to demolish it. 
102Sm 20:16 Just then a wise woman called out from the city. "Attention!" she said, "Go tell Joab 'Come here! I want to talk to you!'" 
102Sm 20:17 Joab came over and the woman asked him, "Are you Joab?" "I am," he answered. So she told him, "Listen to what your servant has to say!" "I'm listening," he replied.
102Sm 20:18 So she said, "In days past, people used to settle a dispute by saying 'Let's ask for advice at Abel!' 
102Sm 20:19 I'm one of the peaceful and faithful citizens of Israel. You're trying to destroy a city that's a mother in Israel. Why are you devouring the heritage of the Lord?"20
102Sm 20:20 But Joab replied, "No way! No way! I'm not here to devour or destroy! 
102Sm 20:21 That's a lie! But there is a man from the Ephraim hill country - he's known as Bichri's son Sheba - who has rebelled against King David. Turn him over and I'll withdraw from the city!" So the woman replied, "Watch this! His head will be thrown to you over the city wall." 
102Sm 20:22 Then the woman wisely went back to her people. They cut off the head of Bichri's son Sheba and threw it out to Joab, so Joab sounded his battle trumpet and they withdrew from the city. Everybody went back home and Joab returned to the king at Jerusalem.
102Sm 20:23 Joab commanded the entire army of Israel, Jehoiada's son Benaiah commanded the Cherithites and Pelethites, 
102Sm 20:24 Adoram supervised conscripted labor, Ahilud's son Jehoshaphat was the recorder, 
102Sm 20:25 Sheva was secretary, Zadok and Abiathar were priests, 26and Ira the Jairite was David's priest.
102Sm 21:1 One time there was a famine during David's reign that went on for three straight years. David sought the Lord, who said, "Saul and his household are guilty because he executed the Gibeonites."
102Sm 21:2 So the king called together the Gibeonites and conferred with them. Now the Gibeonites weren't part of the nation of Israel, but were the survivors from the Amorites. Although the Israelites had promised to spare them, Saul had started to execute them in his zeal for the people of Israel and Judah.
102Sm 21:3 So David asked the Gibeonites, "What am I to do for you?How am I to make atonement so that you will bless the Lord's heritage?"
102Sm 21:4 "We're not looking for mere silver or gold to be paid by Saul or his household to us," the Gibeonites responded to him. "And it's not for us to execute anyone in Israel." In reply, David asked, "So what are you asking me to do for you?"
102Sm 21:5 They said to the king, "The man who consumed us, who planned our destruction - intending to leave us with nothing in the territory of Israel?
102Sm 21:6 is to have seven of his sons turned over to us. We will hang them in the presence of the Lord at Gibeah, which belonged to Saul, whom the Lord chose." So the king answered, "I will give them." 
102Sm 21:7 The king exempted Mephibosheth, the son of Saul's son Jonathan, because of the promise to the Lord that existed between David and Saul's son Jonathan.
102Sm 21:8 Instead, the king arrested Aiah's daughter Rizpah's two sons Armoni and Mephibosheth, whom she had borne to Saul, and the five sons of Saul's daughter Merab, whom she had borne to Barzillai the Meholathite's son Adriel. 
102Sm 21:9 Then he turned them over to the custody of the Gibeonites, who hanged them on the mountain in the presence of the Lord. All seven of them died at the same time. They were executed during the first days of harvest, just as the barley began to be gathered in.
102Sm 21:10 Then Aiah's daughter Rizpah grabbed some sackcloth and spread it out for herself on the rock where her children had been hanged from the beginning of harvest until the first rain fell from the sky. She would not allow any scavenger birds to land on them during the day nor the beasts of the field to approach them at night.
102Sm 21:11 When David was informed what Rizpah, the daughter of Saul's mistress had done, 
102Sm 21:12 David had Saul's bones and the bones of his son Jonathan removed from the custody of certain men from Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the public square in Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them - that is, back on the day when the Philistines had killed Saul on Mount Gilboa. 
102Sm 21:13 He brought the bones of Saul and his son Jonathan from there along with the bones of those who had been hanged, 
102Sm 21:14 and they buried Saul's bones and his son Jonathan's bones in the territory of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Saul's father Kish. After they had done everything that the king commanded, God responded to prayers for the land.
102Sm 21:15 Afterwards, war broke out between the Philistines and Israel, so David went down to fight the Philistines. David became weary, 
102Sm 21:16 and Ishbi-benob, who had been fathered by giants, said he intended to kill David. (His bronze spearhead weighted 300 shekels, and he carried state-of-the-art weaponry.) 
102Sm 21:17 But Zeruiah's son Abishai came to David's aid, attacked the Philistine, and killed him. After this, David's army told him, "You're not going out any more with us to battle, so Israel's beacon won't be extinguished!" 
102Sm 21:18 Sometime later after this incident, there was another battle with the Philistines at Gob. Sibbechai the Hushathite killed Saph, who had been fathered by giants. 
102Sm 21:19 In yet another battle at Gob, Jaare-oregim the Bethlehemite's son Elhanan killed Goliath the Gittite, the shaft of whose spear resembled that of a weaver's beam. 
102Sm 21:20 Later on, there was another battle at Gath, where there was a very tall man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot - 24 in number - who had also been fathered by giants. 
102Sm 21:21 When he defied Israel, David's brother Shimeah's son Jonathan killed him. 
102Sm 21:22 These four giants, who had been fathered by a giant in Gath, were killed at the hands of David and his servants.21
102Sm 22:1 David composed the words of this song to the Lord the very day the Lord delivered him from the domination of all of his enemies, including from Saul's hands. 
102Sm 22:2 This is what he said£º Lord, you are my stone stronghold and my fortified place; you are continually delivering me.
102Sm 22:3 He is my God, my strong stone - in him I will find my refuge? my shield, the strength of my salvation, my high tower, my way of escape, and the one who is saving me. You will save me from violence.
102Sm 22:4 As I am praising him, I will call out to the Lord, and I will be saved from my enemies.
102Sm 22:5 Because deadly breakers engulfed me, while torrents of abuse from the ungodly overwhelmed me.
102Sm 22:6 Binding ropes from Sheol entangled me while lethal snares hindered me.
102Sm 22:7 I cried out to the Lord in the middle of my troubles; I cried out to my God. He listened to my voice from his sanctuary, and my call for help was heard.
102Sm 22:8 Just then the earth shook and trembled! The foundations of heaven reeled and quaked because the Lord was angry.
102Sm 22:9 Smoke poured out of his nostrils, and fire from his mouth kindling coals to flame by it.
102Sm 22:10 He deformed heaven itself as he descended. Thick darkness enveloped his feet.
102Sm 22:11 He rode on a cherub and flew, soaring on the wings of the wind!
102Sm 22:12 The darkness around him was his canopies - amassed water was his overhanging clouds!
102Sm 22:13 From the shining light that was his presence coals of fire blazed into flame!
102Sm 22:14 The Lord roared from heaven! The Most High let his voice be heard!
102Sm 22:15 He launched his arrows and scattered them - his lightning routed them.
102Sm 22:16 The currents of the sea were revealed and the foundations of the world were exposed at the rebuke of the Lord and at the blazing breath from his nostrils!
102Sm 22:17 He sent for me from on high! He grabbed hold of me, drawing me out of deep water.
102Sm 22:18 He rescued me from my strong enemy - from those who continually hate me, since they were stronger than I.
102Sm 22:19 They confronted me when I was in trouble, but the Lord remained my support!
102Sm 22:20 He brought me to a wide open area, rescuing me because he was pleased with me!
102Sm 22:21 The Lord dealt with me according to my righteousness, rewarding me according to the degree of my innocence,
102Sm 22:22 because I have kept the Lord's way - I haven't willfully abandoned my God - 
102Sm 22:23 and because all of his decrees remain in my thoughts, I have not turned aside from his statutes,
102Sm 22:24 I have been innocent before him, and I've kept myself from incurring guilt.
102Sm 22:25 The Lord has repaid me according to my righteousness, that is, according to my clean standing as he looks at me.
102Sm 22:26 In the company of the gracious you demonstrate your gracious love. In the company of the blamelessly valiant you demonstrate your blamelessness.
102Sm 22:27 In the company of the pure you demonstrate your purity. In the company of the perverted you will appear to be perverse.
102Sm 22:28 You save the nation who is humble but your eyes watch the proud, to bring them down.
102Sm 22:29 For you are my lamp, Lord, the Lord who illuminates my darkness.
102Sm 22:30 By you I devastate armies, by my God I scale walls.
102Sm 22:31 This God! His way is perfect! What the Lord declares proves true. He shields everyone who flees for protection to him!
102Sm 22:32 For who is God apart from the Lord?And who is a Rock, apart from our God - 
102Sm 22:33 This God is my strong place of valor! He has made my life blameless.
102Sm 22:34 He has made my feet like those of a deer, setting me secure on his high places!
102Sm 22:35 He has trained my hands for battle readiness - I can bend a bow made out of bronze.
102Sm 22:36 He has equipped me with the shield that is your salvation, Your gentleness has made me great.
102Sm 22:37 You've made room beneath me for my footsteps, and my feet didn't slip.
102Sm 22:38 I pursued my enemies and conquered them; I didn't return until they were consumed.
102Sm 22:39 I devoured them, striking them down until they could not get up again. They fell beneath my feet.
102Sm 22:40 You strengthened me with valor sufficient for the battle; you made those who rebelled against me fall beneath me.
102Sm 22:41 You made my enemies turn and run, - that is, those who hate me - and I destroyed them!
102Sm 22:42 They looked around, but there was no one to save them - they looked to the Lord, but he paid no attention!
102Sm 22:43 I pulverized them to powder, like the dust of the earth; I crushed them, stomping on them like mud on a street.
102Sm 22:44 You delivered me from civil war among my own people. You preserved me as head of the nations. People whom I had never known served me!
102Sm 22:45 Foreigners came cringing to me; they obeyed as soon as they heard me.
102Sm 22:46 Foreigners lost their courage, coming trembling from their strongholds.
102Sm 22:47 The Lord lives! Blessed be my Rock,  and may my God be exalted, the Rock who is my salvation!
102Sm 22:48 The God who keeps on avenging me, subjugating people beneath me,
102Sm 22:49 delivering me from my enemies. You exalted me above those who rebelled against me, delivering me from violent men.
102Sm 22:50 Because of all of this I will praise you among the nations, Lord, and I will sing praises to your name!
102Sm 22:51 Great is the salvation he brings to his king, showing gracious love to his anointed, to David and to his offspring forever.
102Sm 23:1 This was David's last composition£º The oracle of David, son of Jesse, an oracle by the valiant one who was exalted - anointed by the God of Jacob, the contented psalm writer of Israel.
102Sm 23:2 The Spirit of the Lord speaks within me; his word is on my tongue!
102Sm 23:3 The God of Israel has spoken; the Rock of Israel has talked to me. "When one is governing men justly, he fears God while governing.
102Sm 23:4 He is like dawn's first light, like bright sun blazing on a cloudless morning, glistening on grassland that flourishes after a rain shower.
102Sm 23:5 Is not my dynasty like this with God?Has he not made an eternal covenant with me, preparing every detail of it?And he has made it secure, including my complete salvation, has he not?He has been of continual help, has he not, even with the parts he has not yet brought about - 
102Sm 23:6 But ungodly men are like thorns that are discarded because they cannot be safely handled.
102Sm 23:7 Whoever handles them wears heavy duty clothing, carries strong tools, and burns them to ashes on the spot!
102Sm 23:8 Here's a list of the names of David's special forces£º Josheb-basshebeth the Tahkemonite was head of the Three; he was nicknamed Adino the Eznite because he killed 800 men in a single battle engagement. 
102Sm 23:9 Next was Dodai the Ahohite's son Eleazar. Eleazar, who also was one of the Three, was with David when they challenged the Philistines. When the Philistines had assembled in battle array, the Israelite army retreated, 
102Sm 23:10 but Eleazar remained standing right where he was and fought so hard against the Philistines that he became exhausted - he couldn't even let go of his sword! The Lord magnificently delivered them that day. After Eleazar had won the battle, the other soldiers returned, but only to strip the weapons and armor from the dead.
102Sm 23:11 Next was Shammah, Agee the Hararite's son. One time the Philistines assembled to fight in a field where lentils had been growing. Israel's army retreated from the Philistines, 
102Sm 23:12 but Shammah stood his ground in the middle of the field, defended it, and killed the Philistines. And the Lord brought about a great victory.
102Sm 23:13 One day while the Philistine army was camping in the valley of giants, three of the 30 leaders joined David at the cave of Adullam. 
102Sm 23:14 David was living in that stronghold at the time, while a Philistine garrison was then at Bethlehem.
102Sm 23:15 David expressed his longing, "Oh, how I wish someone would get me a drink of water from the Bethlehem well that's by the city gate!" 
102Sm 23:16 So the Three elite warriors broke through the Philistine ranks, drew some water from the Bethlehem well that was next to the city gate, and brought it back to David. But he refused to drink it. Instead, he poured it out in the Lord's presence, and said, "The Lord forbid that I drink this - this is the blood of men whoe ndangered their own lives!" The Three elite warriors did these things.
102Sm 23:18 Zeruiah's son Abishai, Joab's brother, was the lieutenant in charge of the platoons. He used his spear to fight and kill 300 men, gaining a reputation distinct from the Three. 
102Sm 23:19 He was more well known than the Three, and became their commander, but he never measured up to the Three.
102Sm 23:20 Jehoiada's son Benaiah, who was a valiant man, accomplished great things. He was from Kabzeel. He killed two men named Ariel from Moab and then he also went down into a pit and struck down a lion during a snow storm one day. 
102Sm 23:21 He also killed a soldier from Egypt. Of handsome appearance, the Egyptian carried a spear, but Benaiah attacked him with a staff, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear. 
102Sm 23:22 Benaiah did things like this and gained a reputation comparable to the Three warriors. 
102Sm 23:23 He was well known among the platoons, but he didn't measure up to the Three. David placed him in charge of his security detail.
102Sm 23:24 Among the Thirty were Joab's brother Asahel, Dodo's son Elhanan of Bethlehem, 
102Sm 23:25 Shammah from Harod; Elika from Harod, 
102Sm 23:26 Helez the Paltite, Ikkesh's son Ira from Tekoa, 
102Sm 23:27 Abiezer from Anathoth, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 
102Sm 23:28 Zalmon the Aholite, Maharai of Netophah, 
102Sm 23:29 Baanah's son Heleb from Netophah, Ribai's son Ittai from Gibeah of the Benjaminites, 
102Sm 23:30 Benaiah from Pirathon, Hiddai from the Gaash creeks area, 
102Sm 23:31 Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth from Bahurim, 
102Sm 23:32 Eliahba from Shaalbon, Jashen's sons, 
102Sm 23:33 Shammah's son from Harar, Sharar the Hararite's son Ahiam, 
102Sm 23:34 Ahasbai the Maacathite's son Eliphelet, Ahithophel the Gilonite's son Eliam, 
102Sm 23:35 Hezro from Carmel, Paarai the Arbite, 
102Sm 23:36 Nathan's son Igal from Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 
102Sm 23:37 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai from Beeroth (the armor-bearer for Zeruiah's son Joab), 
102Sm 23:38 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 39Uriah the Hittite - for a total of 37.2324
102Sm 24:1 Later, God's anger blazed forth against Israel, so he incited David to move against them by telling him, "Go take a census of Israel and Judah."
102Sm 24:2 So the king ordered Joab, commander of the special forces, who was with him, "Go throughout the tribes of Israel from Dan to Beersheba and take a census of the people so I can be made aware of the total number."
102Sm 24:3 But Joab replied, "May the Lord your God increase the population of the people a hundredfold while your majesty the king is still alive to see it happen! But why does your majesty the king want to do this?"
102Sm 24:4 But the king's order overruled Joab and the commanders of the special forces, so Joab and the commanders of the special forces left David's presence to take a census of the people of Israel. 
102Sm 24:5 They crossed the Jordan River, encamped at Aroer south of the town that is located in the river valley, proceeding through Gad and then on toward Jazer. 
102Sm 24:6 They went on to Gilead and the territory of Tahtim-Hodshi, then on toward Dan. From Dan they went around to Sidon 
102Sm 24:7 and arrived at the fortified city of Tyre and all of the towns of the Hivites and Canaanites. Eventually they proceeded to Beersheba in the Judean Negev. 
102Sm 24:8 After they had traveled throughout the entire land, they returned to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and 20 days. 
102Sm 24:9 Joab reported the total number of men to the king. In Israel there were 800,000 men trained for war. In Judah there were 500,000.7
102Sm 24:10 Later, David's conscience bothered him after he had numbered the army, so David told the Lord, "I have sinned greatly by what I did. But now I am asking you, please remove the guilt of your servant, since I have acted very foolishly."
102Sm 24:11 Before David arose the next morning, the word of the Lord came to Gad, David's seer£º 
102Sm 24:12 "Go tell David, 'This is what the Lord says£º "I'm holding three choices out for you£º pick one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you."'"
102Sm 24:13 So Gad went to David and asked him, "Shall seven years of famine come to your land, or three months of reversals while you flee from your enemies as they pursue you, or three days of pestilence in your land?Decide right now what I am to answer to the one who sent me."
102Sm 24:14 So David replied to Gad, "This is a very difficult choice for me to make! Let me now please fall into the hand of the Lord, since his mercy is very great, but may I never fall into human hands!"
102Sm 24:15 That very morning, the Lord sent a pestilence to Israel until the conclusion of the time designated, and 70,000 men died from Dan to Beersheba. 
102Sm 24:16 As the angel was stretching out his hand to destroy Jerusalem, the Lord was grieved because of the calamity, so he told the angel who was afflicting the people, "Enough! Stay your hand!" So the angel of the Lord remained near the threshing floor that belonged to Araunah the Jebusite.
102Sm 24:17 When David saw the angel who had been attacking the people, he said to the Lord, "Look, I'm the one who has sinned! I did the evil. These are only sheep! What did they do?Please, let your hand fall on me and on my household!"
102Sm 24:18 That very day, Gad approached David and told him, "Go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor that belongs to Araunah the Jebusite." 
102Sm 24:19 So David went up, just as Gad had ordered, consistent with the Lord's command.18
102Sm 24:20 When Araunah looked down, he saw the king and his staff approaching him. Araunah went out, bowed down before the king with his face on the ground, 
102Sm 24:21 and asked him, "Why has your majesty the king come to his servant?"David replied, "To purchase your threshing floor and to build an altar to the Lord, so the pestilence can be averted from the people."
102Sm 24:22 Araunah responded to David, "May your majesty the king take it and offer whatever pleases him. Here are oxen for a burnt offering, along with the threshing sledges and yokes from the oxen for wood! 
102Sm 24:23 Your majesty, Araunah gives all of this to the king." Araunah also said to the king, "May the Lord your God be pleased with you!"
102Sm 24:24 "No!" the king replied to Araunah. "I will buy them from you at full price. I won't offer to the Lord my God burnt offerings that cost me nothing." So David bought the threshing floor and the oxen for 50 silver shekels, 
102Sm 24:25 built an altar to the Lord there, and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the Lord answered David's prayers for the land and the pestilence on Israel was averted.
