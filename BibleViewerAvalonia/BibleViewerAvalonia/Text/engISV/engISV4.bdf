18Jb 1:1 There once was a man in the land of Uz named Job. The man was blameless as well as upright. He feared God and kept away from evil.
18Jb 1:2 Seven sons and three daughters had been born to him.
18Jb 1:3 His livestock included 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 teams of oxen, 500 female donkeys, and many servants. Indeed, the man's stature greatly exceeded that of many people who lived in the East.
18Jb 1:4 His sons used to travel to each other's houses in turn on a regular schedule and hold feasts, inviting their three sisters to celebrate with them.
18Jb 1:5 When their time of feasting had concluded, Job would rise early in the morning to send for them and consecrate them to God. He would offer a burnt offering for each one, because Job thought, "Perhaps my children sinned by cursing God in their hearts." Job did this time and again.
18Jb 1:6 One day, divine beings presented themselves to the Lord, and Satan accompanied them.
18Jb 1:7 The Lord asked Satan, "Where have you come from?" In response, Satan answered the Lord, "From wandering all over the earth and walking back and forth throughout it."
18Jb 1:8 Then the Lord asked Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on earth. The man is blameless as well as upright. He fears God and keeps away from evil."
18Jb 1:9 But in response, Satan asked the Lord, "Does Job fear God for nothing?
18Jb 1:10 Haven't you surrounded him with a fence on all sides, around his house, and around all that he owns? You have blessed everything he puts his hands on and you have increased his livestock in the land.
18Jb 1:11 However, stretch out your hand and strike everything he owns, and he will curse you to your face."
18Jb 1:12 Then the Lord said to Satan, "Very well then, everything he owns is under your control, only you may not extend your hand against him." So Satan left the Lord's presence.
18Jb 1:13 Some time later, when his children were celebrating in their oldest brother's house,
18Jb 1:14 a messenger approached Job and said, "The oxen were plowing and the female donkeys were grazing nearby
18Jb 1:15 when the Sabeans attacked, captured the servants, and killed them with swords. I alone escaped to tell you!"
18Jb 1:16 While this messenger was still speaking, another came and announced, "A lightning storm struck and incinerated the flock and the servants while they were eating. I alone escaped to tell you!"
18Jb 1:17 While this messenger was still speaking, another came and announced, "The Chaldeans formed three companies, raided the camels, captured the servants, and killed them with swords. Only I alone escaped to tell you."
18Jb 1:18 While this messenger was still speaking, another came and announced, "Your children were celebrating in their oldest brother's house
18Jb 1:19 when a strong wind came straight out of the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house. It collapsed on the young people, and they died. I alone escaped to tell you!"
18Jb 1:20 Then Job stood up, tore his robe, shaved his head, fell to the ground, bowed very low,
18Jb 1:21 and exclaimed£º "I left my mother's womb naked, and I will return to God naked. The Lord has given, and the Lord has taken. May the name of the Lord be blessed."
18Jb 1:22 Job neither sinned nor charged God with wrongdoing in all of this.
18Jb 2:1 Some time later, divine beings again presented themselves to the Lord, and Satan accompanied them to present himself to the Lord.
18Jb 2:2 The Lord asked Satan, "Where have you come from?" In response, Satan told the Lord, "From wandering all over the earth and walking back and forth throughout it."
18Jb 2:3 The Lord asked Satan, "Have you considered my servant Job? There is no one like him on earth. The man is blameless as well as upright. He fears God and keeps away from evil. He remains firm in his integrity, even though you have been urging me to overwhelm him without cause."
18Jb 2:4 Satan answered the Lord, "Skin for skin! The man will give up everything that he owns in exchange for his health.
18Jb 2:5 However, stretch out your hand and strike his bones and flesh, and he'll curse you to your face, won't he?"
18Jb 2:6 Then the Lord said to Satan, "Very well then, he is under your control. Just preserve his life."
18Jb 2:7 So Satan left the Lord's presence and struck Job with terrible boils from the sole of his feet to the top of his head.
18Jb 2:8 Job took a broken piece of pottery to scrape himself while sitting among the ashes.
18Jb 2:9 Then his wife told him, "Do you remain firm in your integrity? Curse God and die!"
18Jb 2:10 But he replied to her, "You're talking like foolish women do. Shall we accept what is good from God but not tragedy?" Throughout all of this, Job did not sin by what he said. 
18Jb 2:11 When Job's three friends heard all these tragedies that happened to him, they each traveled from their home towns to visit him. Eliphaz came from Teman, Bildad came from Shuah, and Zophar came from Naamath. They met together and went to console and comfort him.
18Jb 2:12 Observing him from a distance, at first they didn't even recognize him, so they raised their voices and burst into tears. They each ripped their robes, threw ashes into the air on their heads,
18Jb 2:13 and sat with Job on the ground for a full week without saying a word, since they could see the great extent of his anguish.112
18Jb 3:1 After this, Job spoke up solemnly, cursing the day he was born.
18Jb 3:2 This is what Job said£º
18Jb 3:3 "Let the day when I was born be annihilated, along with the night when it was announced, 'It's a boy!'
18Jb 3:4 Let that day be dark; let God above not care about it; let no light shine over it.
18Jb 3:5 Let darkness and deep gloom reclaim it; let clouds settle down on it; let blackness in mid-day terrify it.
18Jb 3:6 Let darkness carry that night away; let it not take its place joyfully among the days of the year; let it not be entered into the calendar.
18Jb 3:7 "Yes, let that night be barren; let it not appear with its joyful shout. 
18Jb 3:8 Let whoever curses days curse it? those who are ready to awaken monsters.
18Jb 3:9 Let the stars of its evening twilight be dark; let it hope for light but let there be none; let it not see the breaking rays of the dawn.
18Jb 3:10 "For that night refused to shut the doors of my mother's womb; it failed to keep me from seeing this trouble.
18Jb 3:11 Why didn't I die while I was still in the womb, or die while I was being born?
18Jb 3:12 Why was there a lap to hold me, and why were there breasts to nurse me?
18Jb 3:13 "If I had died, I would be lying down by now, undisturbed, asleep, and at rest,
18Jb 3:14 along with kings and counselors of the earth, who used to build for themselves what are now only ruins,
18Jb 3:15 or princes who amassed gold for themselves, and who kept filling their houses with silver.
18Jb 3:16 "Or why was I not buried like a stillborn child, like babies who never saw the light?
18Jb 3:17 In that place, the wicked stop causing trouble, and there those whose strength is exhausted are at rest.
18Jb 3:18 In that place, those who once were prisoners will be at ease together; they won't hear the voice of oppressors.
18Jb 3:19 The unimportant and the important are both there, and the servant is free from his master.
18Jb 3:20 "Why does God give light to the sufferer or life to the bitter person£º
18Jb 3:21 To those who are longing for death? even though it does not come? To those who search for it more than for hidden treasure?
18Jb 3:22 To those who are happy beyond measure when they reach their graves?
18Jb 3:23 To the formerly successful man who has lost his way in life because God has fenced him in?
18Jb 3:24 "As far as I'm concerned, my food comes to me in the form of sighs, and my cries of anguish pour out like water.
18Jb 3:25 For the dreaded thing that I feared has happened to me, what caused me to worry has engulfed me. 
18Jb 3:26 I will not be at ease; I will not be quiet; I will not rest; because trouble has arrived."
18Jb 4:1 In reply, Eliphaz from Teman answered£º 
18Jb 4:2 "Will you get offended if somebody tries to talk to you? Who can keep from speaking at a time like this?
18Jb 4:3 Look! You've admonished many people, and you've strengthened feeble hands.
18Jb 4:4 A word from you has supported those who have stumbled, and has strengthened faltering knees.
18Jb 4:5 "But now it's your turn, and you're the one who is worn out! Now it's striking you, and you're dismayed!
18Jb 4:6 "Your fear of God has been your confidence, hasn't it? The integrity of your life has been your hope, hasn't it?
18Jb 4:7 Now please think£º Who has ever perished when they're innocent? Where have the upright been destroyed?
18Jb 4:8 It's been my experience that those who plow the soil of iniquity and those who sow the seed of trouble will reap their harvest!
18Jb 4:9 They perish by the breath of God; they are consumed by the storm that is his anger.
18Jb 4:10 "The lioness may roar, and the lion cub may growl; but even the ivory teeth of the full grown lion are broken.
18Jb 4:11 Full grown lions die when they cannot find prey; that's when the lion cubs are scattered.
18Jb 4:12 "A message was confided to me; my ear caught a whisper of it.
18Jb 4:13 Disquieting thoughts from dreams at night; when deep sleep falls on everyone.4
18Jb 4:14 A fear fell upon me, along with trembling that caused all my bones to shake in terror.
18Jb 4:15 A spirit glided past me and made the hair on my skin to bristle. 
18Jb 4:16 It remained standing, but I couldn't recognize its appearance. A form appeared before my eyes; At first there was silence, and then this voice£º
18Jb 4:17 'Can a mortal person be more righteous than God? Or can the purity of the valiant exceed that of his maker?'
18Jb 4:18 "Indeed, since he doesn't trust his servants, since he charges his angels with error,
18Jb 4:19 how much less confidence does he have in those who dwell in houses of clay; who were formed from a foundation in dust and can perish like a moth?
18Jb 4:20 They are defeated between morning and evening; they perish forever?and no one notices!
18Jb 4:21 Their wealth perishes with them, doesn't it? They die, and do so without having wisdom, don't they?"
18Jb 5:1 "Cry out, won't you! Is there any one who will answer you? To whom will you turn among the holy ones?
18Jb 5:2 For wrath will slay a fool; zealous anger will kill the naive.
18Jb 5:3 "I myself saw a fool becoming established, but I suddenly cursed where he lived. 
18Jb 5:4 His children are far from deliverance; they'll be maltreated before they leave home, with no one to rescue them.
18Jb 5:5 Then the hungry will devour his harvest, snatching it even from the midst of thorns, while the thirsty covet their wealth.
18Jb 5:6 For wickedness doesn't crop up from dust, nor does trouble sprout out of the ground;
18Jb 5:7 But mankind is born headed for trouble, just as sparks soar skyward."
18Jb 5:8 "Now as for me, I would seek God if I were you; I would commit my case to God.
18Jb 5:9 He is always doing great things that cannot be explained, countless awesome deeds.
18Jb 5:10 He sends rain on the surface of the earth, and waters the surface of the open country.
18Jb 5:11 He sets the lowly on high, and lifts those who mourn to safety.
18Jb 5:12 He frustrates the plans of the crafty; so that what they work for never succeeds.
18Jb 5:13 He captures the wise in their own craftiness, bringing a quick end to their cunning advice.
18Jb 5:14 They meet with darkness in broad daylight; at noonday they grope around as if it were night.
18Jb 5:15 So he delivers from the sword of their mouth? the poor from the power of the mighty.
18Jb 5:16 Therefore there is hope for those who are poor, and iniquity shuts its mouth.
18Jb 5:17 "Indeed, how blessed is the person whom God reproves! So never disrespect the discipline of the Almighty,
18Jb 5:18 because though he wounds, but then applies bandages; though he strikes, his hands still heal.
18Jb 5:19 "He will deliver you through six calamities; and calamity won't touch you throughout the seventh.
18Jb 5:20 He will deliver you from death by famine; in war from the power of the sword.
18Jb 5:21 You'll be protected from the accusing tongue; you need not fear destruction when it heads your way.
18Jb 5:22 You'll laugh at destruction and famine; and you need not fear the beasts of the earth.
18Jb 5:23 For you'll have a pact with the stones in the field; and the beasts of the field will be at peace with you.
18Jb 5:24 You'll know that your home is secure; when you search your possessions, and nothing will be missing.
18Jb 5:25 You'll know that you'll have many children; and that your offspring will be like the grass of the earth.
18Jb 5:26 You'll go to your grave at a ripe old age; like a stack of grain that's harvested at just the right time.
18Jb 5:27 "Look! We have thought all this through, and what we've said is true; So please listen and learn for your own good!"
18Jb 6:1 In rebuttal, Job replied£º
18Jb 6:2 "If only my grief could be weighed; or my calamity piled together on a balance scale!
18Jb 6:3 It would weigh more than the sand on the seashore! Here's why I've talked so rashly£º
18Jb 6:4 "The arrows of the Almighty have pierced me; my spirit absorbs their poison; God's terrors have been arranged just for me!
18Jb 6:5 "Will the wild donkey bray from hunger if fresh grass is beside him? Will the ox low from distress if it is near its feed?
18Jb 6:6 Tasteless food isn't eaten without salt, is it? Is there any taste in an egg white? 
18Jb 6:7 I cannot bring myself to touch them; food like this makes me sick."
18Jb 6:8 "Who will grant my wish? I wish God would grant what I'm hoping for£º
18Jb 6:9 that God would just be willing to crush me; that he would let loose and eliminate me! 
18Jb 6:10 At least I could still take comfort and rejoice in unceasing anguish, for I didn't conceal what the Holy One has to say.
18Jb 6:11 "Do I have the strength to wait? And why should I be patient?
18Jb 6:12 Am I as strong as a rock? Am I some kind of iron man?
18Jb 6:13 There is no help within me, is there? My resources have been driven away from me, haven't they?
18Jb 6:14 The friend shows gracious love for his friend, even if he has forsaken the fear of the Almighty.
18Jb 6:15 But my brothers have acted treacherously like a cascading river, like torrential rivers that overflow.
18Jb 6:16 Filled with waters made cold by ice; they are where the snow goes to hide.
18Jb 6:17 But then the snow melts, and they disappear; when warmed, they evaporate from their stream beds.
18Jb 6:18 Travelers divert in their route; they go into a wasteland and die.
18Jb 6:19 Travelers from Tema search intently; caravans from Sheba hope to find them.
18Jb 6:20 For all their expectations, they are doomed to disappointment; even though they have come and searched this far.
18Jb 6:21 "And now you're all just like them, aren't you? You see my terror and are terrified. 
18Jb 6:22 When did I ever ask you for anything, say 'Offer a bribe for me from your wealth?'
18Jb 6:23 or say 'Deliver me from my enemy's control,' or 'Redeem me from the domination of ruthless people'?"
18Jb 6:24 "Instruct me, and I'll remain silent. Help me understand where I've gone astray.
18Jb 6:25 The truth can be painful, but what has your argument proven?
18Jb 6:26 Did you intend your words to reprove, even though the speech of a desperate person is just wind?
18Jb 6:27 Indeed, you would gamble to buy an orphan; and barter to buy your friend!
18Jb 6:28 Now be willing to face me, and I won't lie to your face.
18Jb 6:29 Repent! Let there be no injustice; Change your ways! My vindication is at stake.
18Jb 6:30 Have I said anything that's unjust? I can discern evil, can't I?"
18Jb 7:1 "Men have harsh servitude on earth, do they not? His days are like those of a hired laborer, are they not? 
18Jb 7:2 I'm like a servant who longs for the shade, like a hired laborer who is looking for his wages,
18Jb 7:3 truly I've been allotted months of emptiness; nights of trouble have been allocated to me.
18Jb 7:4 "When I lie down I ask, 'When will I wake up?' But the night continues and I keep tossing and turning until dawn.
18Jb 7:5 My skin is covered with worms and clods of dirt; my skin becomes rough and then breaks out afresh.
18Jb 7:6 My days pass as swiftly as a hand-loom; but they come to their conclusion without hope.
18Jb 7:7 Remember that my life is a breath; my eyes won't go back to seeing good things. 
18Jb 7:8 The eyes of the one who sees me won't see me anymore; your eyes will look for me but I won't be around!
18Jb 7:9 As a cloud fades away and vanishes, the one who descends to the afterlife doesn't return.
18Jb 7:10 He doesn't return again to his house, and his place won't recognize him any more."
18Jb 7:11 "In addition, I won't keep my opinion to myself; I'll speak from my distressed spirit; I'll complain with my bitter soul.
18Jb 7:12 Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you keep watching me?
18Jb 7:13 For I've said, 'My bed will comfort me; my couch will ease my burdens while I complain.'
18Jb 7:14 But then you scared me with dreams; you terrified me with visions.
18Jb 7:15 I would rather die by strangulation than continue living.
18Jb 7:16 I hate the thought of living forever! Leave me alone, because my days are pointless."
18Jb 7:17 "What is a human being, that you make so much of him; that you set your affections on him,
18Jb 7:18 visit him every morning, and test him continually?
18Jb 7:19 Why won't you look away from me? Why don't you leave me alone so I can swallow my saliva? 
18Jb 7:20 So what if I sin? What have I done against you, you observer of humankind? Why have you made me your target? Why burden yourself with me? 
18Jb 7:21 Why haven't you pardoned my transgression and taken away my iniquity? Now I'm about to lie down in the dust. You will seek me diligently, but I won't be around!"
18Jb 8:1 Then in response, Bildad from Shuah said£º
18Jb 8:2 "How long will you keep talking like this? How long will you keep talking like a wind storm?
18Jb 8:3 Does God pervert justice? Does the Almighty pervert what's right?
18Jb 8:4 "If your children sin against him; he'll make them a prisoner of their sins.
18Jb 8:5 If you seek God, if you ask the Almighty for mercy,
18Jb 8:6 if you are clean and upright; surely then he'll act on your behalf and restore your rightful place.
18Jb 8:7 Your beginning may be small, but later years will be very great.
18Jb 8:8 "Inquire of the previous generation, won't you please? Consider what their forefathers searched out.
18Jb 8:9 Because we are of yesterday and we know nothing; for our time on earth is only a shadow.
18Jb 8:10 Won't they instruct you, and tell you, and bring out words from the heart?
18Jb 8:11 "Can papyrus grow where there's no marsh? Can reeds flourish without water?
18Jb 8:12 While they are still green, and not yet ready to be harvested, they wither before any plant.
18Jb 8:13 Such are the paths of everyone who forgets God? the hope of the godless will be destroyed£º
18Jb 8:14 his confidence is shattered; his trust is in a spider's web.
18Jb 8:15 He leans against his house, but it won't stand; he grabs hold of it firmly, but it doesn't last. 
18Jb 8:16 He is a fresh sapling planted in the sunlight, spreading out its branches over its garden.
18Jb 8:17 Its roots weave around a pile of stones, seeking to entrench itself among the rocks.
18Jb 8:18 If he is uprooted from his place; then it will deny him£º 'I never saw you.' 
18Jb 8:19 "Indeed, this is the benefit of God's way£º from the soil other plants will sprout.
18Jb 8:20 Surely God won't reject those who are blameless or hold hands with evildoers.
18Jb 8:21 He will soon fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips will shout with joy.
18Jb 8:22 Those who hate you will be clothed with shame; and the tent of the wicked will no longer exist.
18Jb 9:1 This was Job's response£º
18Jb 9:2 "Indeed, I'm fully aware that this is so, but how can a person become right with God?
18Jb 9:3 If one were to seek to argue with him, he won't be able to answer him even once in a thousand times.
18Jb 9:4 He is wise in heart and strong in will? who can be stubborn against him and succeed?
18Jb 9:5 "He removes mountains without their knowledge, overthrowing them in his anger.
18Jb 9:6 He shakes the earth from its orbit, so that its foundations shudder.
18Jb 9:7 He commands the sun so that it doesn't shine and seals up the stars.
18Jb 9:8 He alone spreads out the heavens, he walks on the waves of the sea.
18Jb 9:9 He created Bear, Orion, the Pleiades, and the southern constellations.
18Jb 9:10 He does great things that cannot be explained, and awesome deeds that cannot be counted.
18Jb 9:11 "If he were to pass near me, I wouldn't notice; if he moves by, I wouldn't perceive him.
18Jb 9:12 Indeed, if he snatches someone away, who could restrain him? Who can say to him, 'What are you doing?'
18Jb 9:13 "God doesn't restrain his anger. Rahab's assistants are humiliated under him.
18Jb 9:14 So how am I to answer him, choosing what I am to say to him?
18Jb 9:15 Even if I'm in the right, I cannot answer him. I can only appeal for mercy.
18Jb 9:16 "Were I to be summoned, and he were to answer me, I wouldn't even believe that he was listening to what I have to say.
18Jb 9:17 For he crushes me with a storm, and keeps on wounding me for no reason.
18Jb 9:18 He won't let me catch my breath; instead, he fills me with bitterness.
18Jb 9:19 "Is this a contest of strength? He is obviously stronger! Is this a matter of justice? Who can sue him?
18Jb 9:20 Though I'm in the right, my own mouth will condemn me; though I'm blameless, he'll pronounce me as guilty.
18Jb 9:21 "I'm blameless; I don't know myself; I despise my life.
18Jb 9:22 I say it's all the same? he destroys both the blameless and the guilty.
18Jb 9:23 If a calamity causes sudden death, he'll mock at the despair of the innocent.
18Jb 9:24 A land is given into the hands of a wicked person; he covers the faces of its judges. If it is not God, then who is it?"
18Jb 9:25 "My days pass faster than a runner; but they pass quickly without seeing anything good.
18Jb 9:26 They pass by like a ship made of reeds, like an eagle swooping down on its prey.
18Jb 9:27 If I were to say, 'Let me forget my complaint,' change the expression on my face, and look cheerful,
18Jb 9:28 then I still dread all of my suffering; I know you still won't acquit me.
18Jb 9:29 I will be condemned, so why should I wear myself out with this futility?
18Jb 9:30 "If I wash myself with water from snow, and cleanse my hands with lye,
18Jb 9:31 you'll still drop me into the Pit;and my own clothes will despise me.
18Jb 9:32 He's not a man like me, so that I can answer him, or that we can enter into litigation with one another. 
18Jb 9:33 There is not yet a mediator between us, who would set his hand on the two of us,
18Jb 9:34 removing his rod from me; and not letting terror of him overwhelm me.
18Jb 9:35 Otherwise, I would speak without being terrified of him, because I'm not like that inside myself."
18Jb 10:1 "I am disgusted with living, so I'm going to talk about my complaint freely. I'll speak out from the bitterness of my soul.
18Jb 10:2 I'll say to God, 'Don't condemn me! Let me know why you are fighting me.
18Jb 10:3 Does it delight you to oppress or despise what you have made, while you smile at the plans of the wicked? 
18Jb 10:4 Do you have eyes made of flesh? Can you look at things as humans do?
18Jb 10:5 Can you live only as long as a human being? Or live the years of a mortal man?
18Jb 10:6 "'For you seek out my iniquity and search for my sin.
18Jb 10:7 Although you know that I'm not guilty, there's no one to deliver me from you!
18Jb 10:8 Your hands formed and fashioned me, but then you have destroyed me all at once on all sides.
18Jb 10:9 "'Please remember that you've made me like clay and you'll return me to dust.
18Jb 10:10 Didn't you pour me out like milk and let me congeal like cheese?
18Jb 10:11 You covered me with skin and flesh, weaving me together with bones and sinews.
18Jb 10:12 You gave life and gracious love to me; your providential care has preserved my spirit.
18Jb 10:13 But you've hidden these things in your heart? I know this was your purpose£º
18Jb 10:14 If I sin, you watch me and won't acquit me for my iniquity.
18Jb 10:15 "'Woe to me if I'm guilty! If I'm innocent, I cannot lift my head, because I am filled with disgrace. Look at my affliction!
18Jb 10:16 But if I do lift up my head, you will hunt me like a lion! You will perform miracles in order to fight against me.
18Jb 10:17 "'You have brought new witnesses against me, you're even more angry with me? you've brought fresh troops to attack me!
18Jb 10:18 So why did you bring me out from the womb? I wish I had died, before any one had seen me,
18Jb 10:19 as if had never existed; carried from the womb to the grave.
18Jb 10:20 My days are so few, aren't they? So leave me alone, then, so I can smile a little
18Jb 10:21 before I go, never to return, leaving for the land of deep darkness and shadow.
18Jb 10:22 It's a gloomy land, like deepest darkness; here there's no order, and where even the brightness is like darkness.'"
18Jb 11:1 Zophar from Naamath had this to say£º
18Jb 11:2 "Shouldn't a multitude of words be answered, or a person who talks too much be vindicated?
18Jb 11:3 Will your irrational babble silence people, and when you mock them, will you escape without being shamed?
18Jb 11:4 You've said, 'My teaching is flawless; I'm clean in God's sight.'
18Jb 11:5 "But what if God were to speak? What if he were to talk with you,
18Jb 11:6 and disclose his wise secrets? After all, there's so much more to understanding. So be aware that God will exact from you less than your sin deserves."
18Jb 11:7 "Can you search through God's complex things? Can you uncover the limits of the Almighty?
18Jb 11:8 These things are higher than the heavens, so what can you do? They are deeper than Sheol, so what can you know?
18Jb 11:9 They are longer than the earth's circumference, and broader than the ocean.
18Jb 11:10 "If he bypasses, or imprisons, or convenes a court, who can stop him?
18Jb 11:11 For he knows mankind's deceitfulness; when he sees iniquity, won't he himself consider it?
18Jb 11:12 An empty-headed person will gain understanding when a wild ass is born a human being!"
18Jb 11:13 "Now for you, if you will prepare your heart, spread out your hands to him.
18Jb 11:14 If you have any iniquity, throw it far away. Don't let evil live in your residence.
18Jb 11:15 Then your confidence will be flawless, and your security will keep you from terror.
18Jb 11:16 You'll forget your suffering; you'll remember it like water that has evaporated.
18Jb 11:17 Your life will be brighter than noonday. Even its darkness will be like dawn.
18Jb 11:18 You'll be secure, because there is hope; you'll see that you're at rest and safe.
18Jb 11:19 When you sleep, there'll be nothing to fear; and many will court your favor.
18Jb 11:20 But what the wicked look for will fail; their way of escape will be taken away from them; their only hope is to take their final breath."
18Jb 12:1 In response Job replied£º
18Jb 12:2 "Truly, you are the people and wisdom will die with you!
18Jb 12:3 Like you, I also have understanding. I'm not inferior to you; who doesn't know things like this?"
18Jb 12:4 "I'm a laughingstock to my friends, someone who called on God. But then he answered this upright and blamelessness man, and I have become a laughingstock.
18Jb 12:5 The carefree are thinking, 'I have contempt for misfortune,' Those who are about to stumble deserve it.
18Jb 12:6 The tents of robbers are at rest, and those who provoke God are secure, that is, those who carry their god in their pocket.
18Jb 12:7 "Ask the wild animals, and they'll teach you; the birds of the sky will tell you.
18Jb 12:8 Or ask the green plants of the earth and they'll teach you; let the fish in the sea tell you.
18Jb 12:9 Who among all of these doesn't know that the Lord's hand made them,
18Jb 12:10 and that the life of every living thing rests in his control, along with the breath of every living human being?
18Jb 12:11 The ear scrutinizes speech just as the palate tastes food?"
18Jb 12:12 "Wisdom may be found in the company of the aged. Understanding comes with longevity.
18Jb 12:13 With God is wisdom and strength; counsel and understanding belongs to him.
18Jb 12:14 When he tears down, nobody rebuilds; when he incarcerates, nobody escapes.
18Jb 12:15 When he withholds water, rivers dry up; when he lets them loose, they'll flood the land.
18Jb 12:16 "With God are strength and sound wisdom; both the deceived and those who deceive are responsible to him.
18Jb 12:17 He leads counselors away naked; he turns judges into fools.
18Jb 12:18 He strips away the authority of kings to punish and puts them in prison clothes instead.
18Jb 12:19 He leads away the priests naked and overthrows the ruling class.
18Jb 12:20 He keeps reliable advisors from speaking, and removes discernment from elders.
18Jb 12:21 He pours contempt on nobles and embarrasses the mighty.
18Jb 12:22 He uncovers the hidden dimensions from darkness, bringing what is in deep shadow to light. 
18Jb 12:23 He makes nations great, and then destroys them; he enlarges nations, but then sends them away to captivity.
18Jb 12:24 He withdraws understanding from national leaders of the world, causing them to wander through uncharted wilderness. 
18Jb 12:25 They grope in the dark without light; he causes them to stagger around like a drunkard."
18Jb 13:1 "Look, I've seen everything; I've listened carefully and I understand.
18Jb 13:2 What you know, I know, too; I'm not inferior to you. 
18Jb 13:3 But I want to talk to the Almighty; and I'm determined to argue my case before God."
18Jb 13:4 "But as for you, you whitewash with lies; all of you are worthless quacks.
18Jb 13:5 I wish you'd all just shut up. Then at least you would appear to be wise.
18Jb 13:6 "Now listen to my dispute! Pay attention to my arguments.
18Jb 13:7 Why do you speak falsely on God's behalf and speak deceitfully about him?
18Jb 13:8 Will you show partiality to him? Will you plead God's case?
18Jb 13:9 Will things go well for you under his cross-examination? Can you lie to him, as you would to a human being?
18Jb 13:10 "He will be sure to rebuke you, if you show partiality in secret.
18Jb 13:11 His splendor will petrify you with terror, paralyzing you with fear, won't it?
18Jb 13:12 Your maxims are just worthless proverbs; your defensive arguments are made of clay."
18Jb 13:13 "Don't talk to me! It's my turn to speak; then whatever happens, happens.13
18Jb 13:14 Why shouldn't I bite my flesh or take my life in my hands?
18Jb 13:15 Even though he kills me, I'll continue to hope in him. At least I'll be able to argue my case to his face!
18Jb 13:16 I have this as my salvation£º the godless person won't be appearing before him.
18Jb 13:17 Pay attention to what I have to say and listen to my testimony with your own ears."
18Jb 13:18 "Look, now! I've prepared my case for court. I know that I'm going to win.
18Jb 13:19 Who can oppose me? If they do, I'll be silent and die.
18Jb 13:20 Grant me only two things as you deal with me; then I won't hide from you.
18Jb 13:21 Withdraw your hand far from me and keep me from being petrified with terror.
18Jb 13:22 Then call and I'll answer, or let me speak and then you reply to me!"
18Jb 13:23 "How many of my iniquities and sins have you counted? Show me my transgression and sin.
18Jb 13:24 Why do you hide your face and regard me as your enemy?
18Jb 13:25 Are you a god who would make a leaf tremble or who would prosecute a dry straw?
18Jb 13:26 You've accused me of bitter things; you've caused me to reap the sins of my youth.
18Jb 13:27 You've locked my feet in stocks; you watch all my steps; You've limited where I can walk.
18Jb 13:28 So I'm a man who wears out like something rotten, like a garment that has become moth-eaten."
18Jb 14:1 Human beings born by women are short-lived and full of trouble.
18Jb 14:2 He springs up like a flower and then withers. Like a shadow, he disappears and doesn't last.
18Jb 14:3 Indeed, have you opened your eyes on one like this? to bring me into a legal fight with you?
18Jb 14:4 Who can produce a clean thing from an unclean thing? No one!
18Jb 14:5 Since his days have been determined, the number of his months is known to you. You've set his limit and he cannot exceed it.
18Jb 14:6 Look away from him and leave him alone, so he can enjoy his time, like a hired worker."
18Jb 14:7 "There is hope for the tree, if it is cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its shoots won't stop growing.
18Jb 14:8 Even if its roots have grown ancient in the earth, and its stump begins to rot in the ground,
18Jb 14:9 the presence of water will make it to bud so that it sprouts new branches like a young plant.
18Jb 14:10 "But when a person dies and wastes away, when a person breathes his last, where will he be?
18Jb 14:11 As water disappears from the sea, or water evaporates from a river,
18Jb 14:12 so also a person lies down and does not get up; they won't awaken until the heavens are no more, nor will they arise from their sleep."
18Jb 14:13 "Won't you keep me safe me in the afterlife? Conceal me until your anger subsides. Set an appointment for me, then remember me.
18Jb 14:14 If a human being dies, will he live again? I will endure the entire time of my assigned service, until I am changed.
18Jb 14:15 You'll call and I'll answer you; you'll long for your creatures that your hands have made.
18Jb 14:16 Then you'll certainly count every step I took, but you won't keep an inventory of my sin.
18Jb 14:17 My transgressions would be sealed up in a bag; you would cover over my sins.
18Jb 14:18 "Mountains fall and crumble; rocks are dislodged from their places.
18Jb 14:19 Water wears away stones; floods wash away topsoil from the land? but you destroy the hope of human beings just like that!
18Jb 14:20 You overpower him once and for all, and then he departs; you change his appearance and then send him away.
18Jb 14:21 "If his children are honored, he doesn't know it; if they become insignificant, he never perceives it.
18Jb 14:22 He feels only his own pain, and grieves only for himself."
18Jb 15:1 Then Eliphaz from Teman responded£º
18Jb 15:2 "Should a wise person respond with knowledge based on wind? Should he fill his stomach with a wind storm from the east?
18Jb 15:3 Should he engage in unprofitable argument, or give a speech that benefits no one?
18Jb 15:4 Yet you dispense with fear of God and hinder meditations before God.
18Jb 15:5 Because your sin dictates your speech, you have chosen the language of the crafty.
18Jb 15:6 Your own mouth is condemning you, not I; your own lips will testify against you."
18Jb 15:7 "Were you the first personto be born? Were you brought forth before the hills were made?
18Jb 15:8 Have you listened in on God's secret council? Have you limited wisdom only to yourself?
18Jb 15:9 What do you know that we don't know, or that you understand and that isn't clear to us?
18Jb 15:10 "We have both the gray-haired and the aged with us, and they are far older than your father.
18Jb 15:11 Are God's encouragements inconsequential to you, even a word that has been spoken gently to you?
18Jb 15:12 Why have your emotions carried you away? And why do your eyes flash
18Jb 15:13 that you turn your anger against God and speak words like this?
18Jb 15:14 "What is mankind, that he can be blameless? Or does being born of a woman mean he'll be in the right?
18Jb 15:15 Look, if God doesn't trust his holy ones, if even the heavens aren't pure as he looks at them,
18Jb 15:16 then how much less is one who is abhorred and corrupted, such as a man who drinks injustice like water?"
18Jb 15:17 "I'll tell you what, listen to me! Let me relate what I've seen,
18Jb 15:18 which is what wise men have explained, who didn't withhold anything from their ancestors.
18Jb 15:19 To them alone was the land given, when no invader passed through their midst.
18Jb 15:20 "The wicked person writhes in pain throughout his life, a number of years has been reserved for the ruthless.
18Jb 15:21 Terrifying sounds ring in his ears; when times are prosperous, the Destroyer will attack him.
18Jb 15:22 He does not believe he will escape darkness; he is destined for the sword.
18Jb 15:23 He wanders around for food?where is it? He knows that a time of darkness is near.
18Jb 15:24 Distress and pressure terrify him; they overwhelm him, like a king poised for attack.
18Jb 15:25 "For he has raised his fist against God, defying the Almighty.
18Jb 15:26 He defiantly ran against him carrying his thick, reinforced shield.
18Jb 15:27 Though he covered his face with fat, and is grossly overweight at the waist,
18Jb 15:28 He will live in devastated towns, in abandoned houses that are about to become heaps of rubble.
18Jb 15:29 "He won't become rich and his wealth won't last; he won't expand his holdings to cover the land.
18Jb 15:30 He won't escape darkness; a flame will wither his shoots; and he'll depart by the breath of God's mouth.
18Jb 15:31 Let him not trust in a worthless speech. He leads only himself astray, for emptiness will be his reward.
18Jb 15:32 This will be accomplished before his time; his branches won't grow luxuriant.
18Jb 15:33 "He is like a vine that drops its unripe grapes; like an olive tree that loses its blossoms.
18Jb 15:34 For the company of the godless is desolation, and fire consumes the tents of those who bribe.
18Jb 15:35 For they conceive mischief and give birth to iniquity; their womb is pregnant with deception."
18Jb 16:1 In response, Job said£º
18Jb 16:2 "I've heard many things like this. What miserable comforters you all are!
18Jb 16:3 Will windy words like yours never end? What is upsetting you that you keep on arguing?
18Jb 16:4 "I could also talk like you if only you were in my place! Then I would put together an argument against you. I would shake my head at you
18Jb 16:5 and encourage you with what I have to say; my words of comfort would lessen your pain.
18Jb 16:6 "But if I speak, my pain isn't assuaged; if I refrain from speaking, what do I have to lose?"
18Jb 16:7 "God has certainly worn me out; you devastated my entire world.
18Jb 16:8 You've arrested me, making me testify against myself! My leanness rises up to attack me, accusing me to my face.
18Jb 16:9 His anger tears me in his persistent resentment against me; he gnashes his teeth at me. My adversary glares at me.
18Jb 16:10 People gaped at me with mouths wide open; they slap me in their scorn and gather together against me.
18Jb 16:11 God has delivered me over to the ungodly, throwing me into the control of the wicked.
18Jb 16:12 "He tore me apart when I was at ease; grabbing me by my neck, he shook me to pieces? then he really made me his target.
18Jb 16:13 His archers surround me, slashing open my kidneys without pity; he pours out my gall on the ground.
18Jb 16:14 Attack follows attack as he breaks through my defenses! He runs over me like a mighty warrior.
18Jb 16:15 "I've even sewn sackcloth directly to my skin; I've buried my strength in the dust.
18Jb 16:16 My face is red from my tears, and dark shadows encircle my eyelids,
18Jb 16:17 even though violence is not my intention, and my prayer is pure."
18Jb 16:18 "Listen, earth! Don't cover my blood, for my outcry has no place to rest.
18Jb 16:19 Even now, behold! I have a witness in heaven, my Advocate is on high.
18Jb 16:20 My friends mock me, while my eyes overflow with tears to God,
18Jb 16:21 crying for him to arbitrate between this man and God; as a human being does with his fellow neighbor.
18Jb 16:22 For when only a few years have elapsed, I'll start down a path from which I'll never return."
18Jb 17:1 "My spirit is crushed, my days are over; it's the grave for me!
18Jb 17:2 Mockers surround me; I cannot stop staring at their hostility all through the night.
18Jb 17:3 Offer, then, some collateral on my behalf. Is there anyone who will be my guarantor?
18Jb 17:4 "Because you're the one who closed their hearts to compassion; therefore, you won't let them triumph.
18Jb 17:5 Now as for the one who testifies against his friends to take their property, even the eyes of his children will fail.
18Jb 17:6 "He has made me a byword among people; I'm being spit on in the face.
18Jb 17:7 My eyes have grown weak from grief; and my whole body is as thin as a shadow.
18Jb 17:8 The upright are appalled over this, and the innocent person is troubled by the godless.
18Jb 17:9 But the righteous person will hold to his way, and those with clean hands will grow stronger and stronger."
18Jb 17:10 "Come here now, all of you, and I won't find a wise person among you.17
18Jb 17:11 My days are passed; my plans have been shattered; along with my heart's desires.
18Jb 17:12 They have transformed night into day? 'The light,' they say, 'is about to become dark.'
18Jb 17:13 "If my hope were that my house is the afterlife itself, if I were to make my bed in darkness,
18Jb 17:14 if I call out to the Pit, 'You're my father!' or say to the worm, 'My mother!' or 'My sister!'
18Jb 17:15 where would my hope be? "And speaking of my hope, who would notice it?
18Jb 17:16 Will it go down to the bars that lock the doors of the afterlife? Will we descend together into the dust?"
18Jb 18:1 Bildad from Shuah replied, saying£º
18Jb 18:2 "When are you going to stop your word hunt? Think first, and then we can talk.
18Jb 18:3 Why do you think we're like dumb animals? Do you think we're stupid?
18Jb 18:4 You're tearing yourself to pieces in your anger. Will the land be abandoned because of you, or the rock be moved from its place?"
18Jb 18:5 "Indeed, the light of the wicked is extinguished; the flame from his fire doesn't shine.
18Jb 18:6 Light in his tent is dark, and his lamp goes out above him.
18Jb 18:7 His strong steps are restricted, and his own advice trips him up.
18Jb 18:8 "For he has stumbled into a net with his own feet; he walked right into the network!
18Jb 18:9 The trap seizes him by the heel; a snare tightens its hold on him.
18Jb 18:10 A rope lies hidden in the dirt; a trap for him lies waiting for him where he is walking."
18Jb 18:11 "He is petrified by terror that surrounds him on all sides; they chase at his heels.
18Jb 18:12 His is starved for strength; and is ripe for a fall.
18Jb 18:13 Something gnaws on his skin; a deadly disease consumes his limbs.
18Jb 18:14 Torn from the security of his home, he is brought before the king of terrors.
18Jb 18:15 "There's nothing in his tent that belongs to him; sulfur is scattered all over his dwelling place.
18Jb 18:16 His roots wither underneath, while his branches above are being cut off.
18Jb 18:17 No one remembers him anywhere in the land; no one names streets in his honor.
18Jb 18:18 He is driven away from light to darkness, made to wander the landscape.
18Jb 18:19 He has no children or descendants within his own people; and no survivors where he once lived.
18Jb 18:20 People who live west of him are appalled at his fate; those who live east of him are seized with terror.
18Jb 18:21 Indeed, the residences of the wicked are like this; and so are the homes of those who don't know God."
18Jb 19:1 In response, Job said£º
18Jb 19:2 "How long do you intend to keep torturing me and trying to break me by what you're saying?
18Jb 19:3 Ten times you've tried to humiliate me! You're not ashamed to wrong me!
18Jb 19:4 Even if it's true that I've erred, my error only effects me.
18Jb 19:5 If you really intend to vaunt yourselves over me, and make my problems the basis of your case against me,
18Jb 19:6 then at least you must know that God has accused me of wrong, and trapped me with his net."
18Jb 19:7 "Although I cried out 'Violence!' I received no answer; I cried for help, but there was no justice.
18Jb 19:8 He blocked my path, so I cannot pass; and he turned out the lights on my pathways.
18Jb 19:9 "He has stripped me of my honor; he has stolen the crown off my head!
18Jb 19:10 He is breaking me down on every side, and now it's too late for me; he has uprooted my hopes like a tree.
18Jb 19:11 His anger burns against me; he regards me as his adversary.
18Jb 19:12 His troops march in a column against me, erecting their siege ramps against me; they surround my tent."
18Jb 19:13 "My brothers are alienated from me; my acquaintances are estranged;
18Jb 19:14 my relatives have failed me; and my friends have abandoned me.
18Jb 19:15 Those who live in my house? and my maidservants, too!? treat me like a stranger; they think I'm a foreigner.
18Jb 19:16 "I call to my servant, but he doesn't respond, even though I beg to him earnestly.
18Jb 19:17 My wife says my breath stinks; even my children say I smell bad!
18Jb 19:18 Even little children hate me; when I get up, they mock at me.
18Jb 19:19 My closest friends detest me; even the ones I love have turned against me.
18Jb 19:20 I'm a pile of skin and bones; I have barely escaped by the skin of my teeth."
18Jb 19:21 "Be gracious to me, be gracious to me, my friends, because God's hand has struck me.
18Jb 19:22 Why are you chasing me, as God has been doing? Aren't you satisfied that I'm sick?
18Jb 19:23 If only my words were written down; if only they were inscribed in a book
18Jb 19:24 using an iron stylus with lead for ink! Then they'd be engraved in rock forever.
18Jb 19:25 "As for me, I know that my Redeemer lives; at the end of the world, he'll take his stand on the soil.
18Jb 19:26 Even after my skin has been destroyed, clothed in my flesh I will see God,
18Jb 19:27 whom I will see for myself. My own eyes will look at him? there won't be any one else for me!? He is the culmination of my innermost desire."
18Jb 19:28 "When you're thinking about asking yourselves, 'How will we pursue him, since the root of the problem is with him?'
18Jb 19:29 Make sure that you remain wary of God 's sword, for God's wrath brings with it the sword of punishment, by which you'll know there's a judgment."
18Jb 20:1 Then Zophar from Naamath replied£º
18Jb 20:2 "Therefore my anxious thoughts cause me to answer because I'm agitated within me.
18Jb 20:3 Whenever I hear an insulting rebuke, I respond from my spirit because I understand."
18Jb 20:4 "Haven't you known this from ancient times, since mankind was placed on the earth?
18Jb 20:5 The wicked triumph only briefly; the joy of the godless is momentary.?
18Jb 20:6 Though he grow as tall as the sky, or though his head touches the clouds,
18Jb 20:7 he'll perish forever, like his own excrement; those who saw him will ask, 'Where is he?'
18Jb 20:8 He'll vanish like a dream, and no one will find him; he will be chased away like a night vision."
18Jb 20:9 "An eye that gazes at him won't do so again; and his place won't even recognize him.
18Jb 20:10 His sons will make amends to the poor; their hands will return his wealth.
18Jb 20:11 Though his bones were full of youthful vigor; yet they will lie down with him in the dust.
18Jb 20:12 Though evil tastes sweet in his mouth, though he conceals it under his tongue,
18Jb 20:13 though he savors it and delays swallowing it so he can taste it again and again in his mouth,
18Jb 20:14 his food will turn rancid in his stomach? it will become a cobra's poison inside him.
18Jb 20:15 "Though he swallows wealth, he will vomit it; God will dislodge it from his stomach.
18Jb 20:16 He will suck the poison of cobras; the fangs of a viper will slay him. 
18Jb 20:17 He won't look at the rivers? the torrents of honey and curd.
18Jb 20:18 "He will restore what he has attained from his work and won't consume it; he won't enjoy the profits from his business transactions,
18Jb 20:19 because he has crushed and abandoned the poor; he has seized a house that he didn't build.
18Jb 20:20 "Since his appetite won't quit; he won't let anything escape his lust.
18Jb 20:21 Because nothing was left for him to devour, therefore his prosperity won't last.
18Jb 20:22 Even though he is satiated and self-sufficient, he suffers? everyone in any sort of trouble will attack him.
18Jb 20:23 "It will come about that, when he has filled himself to the full, God will vent his burning anger on him; he will pour it out on him and on his body.
18Jb 20:24 Though he dodges an iron weapon, a bronze arrow will pierce him.
18Jb 20:25 It will impale him and come out through his back; the point will glisten as it protrudes through his gall bladder, and he shall be terrified.
18Jb 20:26 "Total darkness has been reserved for his treasures; a fire that has no need to be kindled will devour him and consume whatever remains in his possession.
18Jb 20:27 Heaven will reveal his iniquity, while the earth will rise up against him.20
18Jb 20:28 A flood will wash away his house; dragging it away when God becomes angry.
18Jb 20:29 This is what the wicked person inherits from God; it is the inheritance that God appoints for him."
18Jb 21:1 In response, Job said£º
18Jb 21:2 "Listen carefully to my words; let this encourage all of you.
18Jb 21:3 Bear with me and let me speak! Then, after I've spoken, you'll be free to mock me.
18Jb 21:4 After all, isn't my complaint against a human being? If so, why shouldn't I be impatient?
18Jb 21:5 Look at me, be appalled, and then shut up!
18Jb 21:6 When I think about this, I'm petrified with terror and my body shudders uncontrollably."
18Jb 21:7 "Why do the wicked live to reach old age and increase in power and wealth, too?
18Jb 21:8 Their children grow up while they're alive, and they live to see their grandchildren.
18Jb 21:9 Their houses are safe from fear, and God's chastisement never visits them.
18Jb 21:10 Their bull breeds without fail, and their cows calves without miscarriages.
18Jb 21:11 They release their children to play like sheep; their young ones dance about,
18Jb 21:12 singing with tambourines and lyres as they rejoice to the sound of flutes.
18Jb 21:13 They grow old in prosperity, as they descend peacefully into the afterlife.
18Jb 21:14 "They say to God, 'Turn away from us! We have no desire to know your ways.
18Jb 21:15 Who is the Almighty, that we should serve him? Where's the profit in talking to him?'
18Jb 21:16 Behold! Their prosperity isn't in their control! The counsel of the wicked will remain far from me."
18Jb 21:17 "How often do the wicked have their lights put out? Does calamity ever fall on them? Will God in his anger ever apportion their destruction?
18Jb 21:18 May they become like a straw, blown away before the wind; like a chaff that's swept off by a storm.
18Jb 21:19 God stores up their iniquity to repay their children; making them repay so that they may be aware.
18Jb 21:20 Their own eyes will see their destruction; and they'll drink the wrath of the Almighty.
18Jb 21:21 What will they care for their household after them, when the number of his months comes to an end?"
18Jb 21:22 "Can God learn anything? After all, he will judge even the exalted ones.
18Jb 21:23 Such persons will die in their full vigor, completely prosperous and secure.
18Jb 21:24 His buckets are filled with milk, his bone marrow is healthy.
18Jb 21:25 Others die with a bitter soul, never having tasted the good life.
18Jb 21:26 They both lie down in the dust; and worms covers them."
18Jb 21:27 "Look! I know your thoughts, your plans are going to harm me.
18Jb 21:28 You ask, 'Where is the noble person's house?' and 'Where are the tents where the wicked live?'
18Jb 21:29 Haven't you asked travelers on the highway? Don't you accept their word
18Jb 21:30 that the wicked person is spared from times of calamity, that he is rescued on the day of wrath?
18Jb 21:31 Who will exposes his conduct to his face? Who will repay him for what he has done21
18Jb 21:32 when he is carried away to the cemetery and guardians are placed to watch his tomb?
18Jb 21:33 The runoff from the streams will seem sweet to him; everyone will follow after him; countless crows march ahead of him.
18Jb 21:34 How then, can you console me so worthlessly? What is left of your answers is treachery."
18Jb 22:1 Then in response, Eliphaz from Teman said£º
18Jb 22:2 "Can a human being be useful to God, since he, who is wise, is sufficient to himself? 
18Jb 22:3 Will it please the Almighty if you are innocent, or does he profit if your life is blameless?
18Jb 22:4 Will he acquit you just because you fear him, and render a verdict on your behalf?
18Jb 22:5 Your wickedness is great, isn't it? There's no limited to your iniquity, is there?
18Jb 22:6 "After all, you've taken collateral from your relatives for no reason; you stripped the naked of their clothing.
18Jb 22:7 You've neglected to give water to the weary, and you've withhold food from the hungry.
18Jb 22:8 The land belongs to the powerful, and the privileged thrive in it.
18Jb 22:9 You sent away widows empty-handed, and broke the outstretched arms of orphans.
18Jb 22:10 That's why disaster surrounds you, terror suddenly overwhelms you,
18Jb 22:11 you see nothing but darkness, and a flood of troubles drowns you."
18Jb 22:12 "Isn't God in heaven above? Consider how far away the stars are, and how lofty they are!
18Jb 22:13 You've asked, 'What does God know? Can he sort through pitch black darkness?'
18Jb 22:14 Thick clouds cover him so he can't see as he walks back and forth at heaven's horizon.
18Jb 22:15 "Will you keep walking on the traditional path that sinners have tread,
18Jb 22:16 who were snatched away before their time; when their foundation was swept away by a river?
18Jb 22:17 They told God, 'Get away from us!' and 'What will the Almighty do to them?'
18Jb 22:18 "Though God fills their houses with good things, the counsel of the wicked will remain far from me.
18Jb 22:19 The righteous will see this and rejoice; the innocent will insult him, saying,
18Jb 22:20 'Our enemies are sure to be destroyed, and fire will burn up what's left of their riches."
18Jb 22:21 "Get to know God, and you'll be at peace with him, and then prosperity will come to you.
18Jb 22:22 Accept what he has to teach you, and treasure his words in your heart.
18Jb 22:23 "If you return to the Almighty you'll be restored, as you remove iniquity from your household.
18Jb 22:24 Bury your gold nuggets in the dust, and your source of gold among the stones in a streambed,
18Jb 22:25 and then the Almighty will be your gold and your refined silver.
18Jb 22:26 "Then you'll take delight in the Almighty; and will turn your face toward God.
18Jb 22:27 You'll entreat him and he'll listen to you as you fulfill your vows.
18Jb 22:28 When you make a decision on something, it will be established for you, and light will brighten your way.
18Jb 22:29 "For when they're humbled, you may respond; 'It's their pride!' but he delivers the humble.
18Jb 22:30 He'll even deliver the guilty, who will be delivered through your innocence." 
18Jb 23:1 Job's response was to say£º
18Jb 23:2 "I'm still complaining bitterly today; my hand is heavy because of groaning.
18Jb 23:3 If only I knew where I to find him, I would visit him where he has taken his seat.
18Jb 23:4 I would lay out my case before him; and fill my mouth with arguments.
18Jb 23:5 I know how he would answer me; I understand what he'll tell me.
18Jb 23:6 "Would he use his great power to fight me? No, he'll pay attention to me.
18Jb 23:7 In that place, the upright can reason with him; and I'll be acquitted once and for all by my judge."
18Jb 23:8 "Look! If I go east, he isn't there! If I go to the west, I don't perceive him.
18Jb 23:9 If he's working in the north, I can't observe him; If he turns south, I can't see him.
18Jb 23:10 Because he knows the road on which I travel, when he had tested me, I'll come out like gold.
18Jb 23:11 My feet stay where his footsteps lead; I kept on his path way and haven't turned aside.
18Jb 23:12 I haven't wandered away from the commands that he has spoken; I've treasured what he has said more than my own meals."
18Jb 23:13 "But he is One?who can change him? He does whatever he wants to do.
18Jb 23:14 He'll complete what he has planned for me; he has many things in mind for me!
18Jb 23:15 That's why I'm terrified at his presence! When I think about it, I'm afraid of him.
18Jb 23:16 God has caused me to faint; the Almighty makes me terrified!23
18Jb 23:17 Nevertheless, I haven't been silenced because of the darkness, even when thick darkness obscures my vision."
18Jb 24:1 "Why doesn't the Almighty reserve time for judgment? and why don't those who know him perceive his days?
18Jb 24:2 They move boundary stones, steal flocks, and pasture them.
18Jb 24:3 They drive away the orphan's donkey; they take the ox of the widow as security for a loan;
18Jb 24:4 They push the needy off the road, and force the poor of the land into hiding.
18Jb 24:5 "Look! Like wild donkeys in the wilderness, they work diligently as they seek wild game in the desert, food for them and their young ones.
18Jb 24:6 They reap fodder in the field and glean in the vineyard of the wicked.
18Jb 24:7 They spend the night naked, without clothing with no covering against the cold.
18Jb 24:8 They are wet from mountain rains; without shelter, they cling to a rock.
18Jb 24:9 "The fatherless are torn from the breast; the poor are taken away as security for a loan.
18Jb 24:10 They wander around naked, without clothes; hungry, though they carry sheaves of grain.
18Jb 24:11 They press oil between the olive groves owned by the wicked; they suffer from thirst, even while treading the winepress.
18Jb 24:12 From the city, dying men groan aloud, and the wounded cries out for help, but God charges no one with wrong.
18Jb 24:13 "Then there are those who rebel against the light; they are not acquainted with its ways; and they don't stay on its course.
18Jb 24:14 The murderer rises at dawn to kill the poor and needy; at night, he is like a thief.
18Jb 24:15 The adulterer watches for twilight, saying, 'No eye is watching me' while he veils his face.
18Jb 24:16 They break into houses in the dark; during they day they remained sealed in. They don't know daylight.
18Jb 24:17 As a group, deep darkness is their morning time; fear that lives in darkness is their friend."
18Jb 24:18 "They remain only a short time on the water's surface; their inheritance will be cursed in the land; no one will work in their vineyards.
18Jb 24:19 As drought and heat evaporate melting snow, that's what Sheol does with sinners.
18Jb 24:20 The womb will forget them. Maggots will find them to be a delicacy! They won't be remembered anymore, their iniquity will be cut to pieces like firewood.
18Jb 24:21 "They prey on the barren woman, and do no favors for widows.
18Jb 24:22 God prolongs the life of the strong by his power, but they get up in the morning without purpose in life.
18Jb 24:23 He gives them security and financial support, but he watches everything they do.
18Jb 24:24 They're exalted momentarily, but then they are gone; they are humbled, just like all the others. They are cut down like heads of corn.
18Jb 24:25 If this weren't so, who can prove that I'm a liar by showing that there's nothing to what I'm saying?"
18Jb 25:1 Bildad from Shuah responded and said£º
18Jb 25:2 "Dominion and fear belong to God; who fashions peace in his high heaven.
18Jb 25:3 Is there any limit to his armies? On whom does his light not shine?
18Jb 25:4 How can a human being become right with God? How can a human being be pure?25
18Jb 25:5 Behold, even the moon isn't bright, and the stars aren't pure in his eyes.
18Jb 25:6 How much less is man, who is only a maggot, or a man's children, who are only worms!"
18Jb 26:1 In reply, Job responded£º
18Jb 26:2 "What a help you are to the weak! How powerfully you deliver those without strength!
18Jb 26:3 What counsel you provide to the fool! What insight you provide so abundantly!
18Jb 26:4 Who helped you say all of this? Who inspired you?"
18Jb 26:5 "The ghosts of the dead writhe under the waters along with those who live there with them.
18Jb 26:6 Sheol is naked before God and Abaddon has no clothes.
18Jb 26:7 he spreads out the north over empty space, suspending the earth over nothing.
18Jb 26:8 "He restricts the waters within clouds and the clouds don't burst open under them.
18Jb 26:9 He has enclosed the face of the full moon and spread his clouds over it.
18Jb 26:10 He has delimited a boundary over the surface of the oceans as a limit between light and darkness.
18Jb 26:11 The pillars of the heavens tremble and are astounded at his rebuke.
18Jb 26:12 By his power he disturbs the sea; and with his skill he shatters the sea monster.
18Jb 26:13 he clears the skies with his wind; his hands have pierced the fleeing serpent.
18Jb 26:14 Indeed, these are the fringes of his ways, and how faint is the whisper we've heard of it! But who can comprehend the thunder of his might?"
18Jb 27:1 Job continued with his discussion and said£º
18Jb 27:2 "The living God has withheld justice from me; the Almighty has made my life bitter.
18Jb 27:3 As long as I can breathe; as long as God's breath is in my nostrils,
18Jb 27:4 I won't speak lies nor will I utter deceit.
18Jb 27:5 Far be it from me to admit that you're right! I intend to maintain my integrity even if it kills me!
18Jb 27:6 I'll retain my righteousness and not compromise it; my conscience won't rebuke me at any time.
18Jb 27:7 "May my enemy be like the wicked; my adversary like the unjust.
18Jb 27:8 For where is the hope of the godless when he is eliminated; when God takes away his life?
18Jb 27:9 Will God hear his cry when distress overtakes him?
18Jb 27:10 Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call on God at all times?"
18Jb 27:11 "I'll teach you about the power of God, that which is with the Almighty I won't conceal.
18Jb 27:12 Look! All of you have been watching, so why have you become so completely worthless?
18Jb 27:13 "This is what a wicked person inherits from God, and what the ruthless will receive from the Almighty£º
18Jb 27:14 If he has many children, their destiny is to die by the sword, and his descendants won't have enough food.
18Jb 27:15 Those who do survive him disease will bury, and his widow won't even weep.
18Jb 27:16 "Though he hoards silver like dust, and stores away garments like clay,
18Jb 27:17 whatever he stores up, the righteous will wear, and the innocent will inherit that silver!
18Jb 27:18 "He has built his house like a moth's cocoon, like a temporary sunshade that a watchman makes.
18Jb 27:19 He will go to bed wealthy, but won't be doing that anymore! When he opens his eyes, it will be gone!
18Jb 27:20 Terror will overtake him like a flood, at night, a tornado will sweep him away.
18Jb 27:21 He'll be swept up by a storm wind and carried away; he'll be whirled away from his place.
18Jb 27:22 It will toss him around without pity. He'll try to break free from its grip,
18Jb 27:23 but it will clap its hands over him, hissing at him as it lunges toward him."
18Jb 28:1 "Surely there are mines for silver and places where gold is refined.
18Jb 28:2 Iron is taken from the ground; and copper is smelted from ore.
18Jb 28:3 Mankind limits the darkness as they search the deepest depths for ore in unfathomable darkness.
18Jb 28:4 He sinks his shaft far from human habitations, in a place forgotten by explorers; they hang on harnesses as they swing back and forth.
18Jb 28:5 "While the ground produces food, underneath it is torn up and burning hot,
18Jb 28:6 where stones are sapphire and gold dust can be found,
18Jb 28:7 a place where birds of prey never fly, and the eyes of the falcon have never seen.
18Jb 28:8 The proud beasts haven't walked there; lions have never passed over it.
18Jb 28:9 "Using a flint, he thrusts his hand, overturning mountains by the roots.
18Jb 28:10 He cuts a channel through the rocks, while his eyes search for anything of value.
18Jb 28:11 He dams up flowing rivers, bringing hidden things to light."
18Jb 28:12 "Where can wisdom be found? Where is understanding's home?
18Jb 28:13 Mankind doesn't appreciate their value; and you won't find it anywhere on earth.
18Jb 28:14 The deepest ocean says, 'It's not within me.' and the sea says, 'You'll never find it with me.'
18Jb 28:15 You can't buy it with gold, and its value cannot be calculated in silver.
18Jb 28:16 It cannot be compared to gold from Ophir, with precious onyx, or with sapphire.
18Jb 28:17 It cannot be compared to gold and fine glass crystal, nor can it be exchanged for advanced weapons.
18Jb 28:18 Don't even bother to mention coral and crystal? wisdom is more valuable than a bag of rubies.
18Jb 28:19 It can neither be compared with the topaz of Ethiopia nor valued in comparison to pure gold."
18Jb 28:20 "From where, then, does wisdom originate? Where does understanding live?
18Jb 28:21 It has been concealed from the sight of every living creature and hidden even from the birds in the skies.
18Jb 28:22 Abaddon and death said, 'We did hear a rumor about it.'
18Jb 28:23 God understands how to get there; he knows where they live.
18Jb 28:24 For he looks as far as the ends of the earth and sees everything under the sky.
18Jb 28:25 "He imparted weight to the wind; he regulated water by his measurement.
18Jb 28:26 He set in place ordinances for the rain; and determined the pathway for thunder that accompanies lightning.
18Jb 28:27 Then he looked at wisdom, and fixed it in place; he established it, and also examined it.
18Jb 28:28 He has commanded mankind£º 'To fear the Lord?that is wisdom; to move away from evil?that is understanding.'"
18Jb 29:1 Then Job continued with his discourse£º
18Jb 29:2 "I wish I could go back to how things were a few months ago; when God used to watch over me,
18Jb 29:3 when his lamp used to shine over my head, so I could walk through the dark,
18Jb 29:4 like when I was my prime and God trusted me with his secrets!
18Jb 29:5 "The Almighty was still with me back then, and my children were still around me.
18Jb 29:6 I was successful wherever I went, and even the rocks poured out streams of olive oil for me."
18Jb 29:7 "Whenever I went out to the city gate, a seat had been reserved for me in the plaza.
18Jb 29:8 The young men would see me and withdraw, and the aged would rise and stand.
18Jb 29:9 Nobles would refrain from speaking, covering their mouths with their hands. 
18Jb 29:10 The voices of the commanders-in-chief were hushed, and their tongues would cling to the roofs of their mouths."29
18Jb 29:11 "When people heard me speak, they blessed me; when people saw me, they approved me,
18Jb 29:12 because I delivered the poor who were crying for help, along with orphans who had no one to help them.
18Jb 29:13 Those who were about to die blessed me, and I made widows sing for joy.
18Jb 29:14 I put on righteousness like clothing; my just decisions were like a robe and a turban.
18Jb 29:15 I served as eyes for the blind and feet for the lame.
18Jb 29:16 I was a father to the needy; I diligently inquired into the case of those I didn't know.
18Jb 29:17 I broke the fangs of the wicked, and made him drop the prey."
18Jb 29:18 "I used to say£º 'I will die in my home. I'm going to live as many days as there are grains of sand on the shore.
18Jb 29:19 My roots have spread out and have found water, and dew settles at night on my branches.
18Jb 29:20 My glory renews for me and my bow is as good as new in my hand.'
18Jb 29:21 "They listened and waited for me, as they remained in silence for my counsel.
18Jb 29:22 After I spoke, they had nothing to say, when what I said hit them.
18Jb 29:23 They waited for me as one waits for rain, as one opens his mouth to drink in a spring rain shower.
18Jb 29:24 I smiled at them when they had no confidence, and no one could discourage me.
18Jb 29:25 I set an example of the way to live, as a leader would; I lived like a king among his army; like one who comfort mourners."
18Jb 30:1 "But now they mock me; men who are far younger than I, whose fathers I've would have hated to entrust with my own sheep dogs.
18Jb 30:2 Furthermore, what could I have gained from men whose strength is gone?
18Jb 30:3 Unproductive due to poverty and hunger, they could only scratch in parched soil, devastated and desolated.
18Jb 30:4 "They would pluck off herbs from salt marshes to eat; and roots of the broom shrub for food.
18Jb 30:5 Driven away from human company, they were shouted at as though they were thieves.
18Jb 30:6 They lived in he most dangerous of ravines, in holes in the ground, and among rocks.
18Jb 30:7 They bray like donkeys among the bushes and huddle together under the desert weeds.
18Jb 30:8 Sons of fools and of uncertain reputation, they have been driven from the land by scourging."
18Jb 30:9 "Now, I've become the object of their mocking melodies; I'm nothing but a fool's proverb to them!
18Jb 30:10 They abhor me?they keep their distance from me; but they don't refrain from spitting at the sight of me.
18Jb 30:11 But God has loosened his cord and afflicted me; so they've cast off all restraints in my presence.
18Jb 30:12 "A wretched crowd ambushes me to my right; they trip my feet; they build up their path of calamity for me.
18Jb 30:13 They tear up my pathways; they profit from my destruction, and they need no help to do this!30
18Jb 30:14 They come like those who breach through a wall; as everything crashes around me they'll roll on and on!
18Jb 30:15 My greatest fears have overcome me; my honor is assaulted as though by a wind storm; my prosperity evaporates like a morning cloud."
18Jb 30:16 "Now, my soul pours itself out; the time of my affliction has taken control of me.
18Jb 30:17 The night racks my bones; and the pain that gnaws on me will not rest.
18Jb 30:18 My clothes are disheveled by his forceful treatment of me; he restricts my movement like the collar of my cloak.
18Jb 30:19 "He tossed me into the mire; I've become like dust and ashes.
18Jb 30:20 I cry for help to you, but you won't answer me; I stand still, but you only look at me.
18Jb 30:21 You changed toward me, and now you're cruel to me; with your mighty hand you are persecuting me;
18Jb 30:22 you carried me off in a wind storm, making me ride on it while you toss me about as the storm roars around me.
18Jb 30:23 I know that you're about to kill me, so I'm about to go to the house that's appointed for all the living."
18Jb 30:24 "Surely he won't stretch his hand against the needy, will he, especially if they cry to him in their calamity?
18Jb 30:25 Haven't I wept for the one who is going through hard times? Haven't I grieved for the needy?
18Jb 30:26 I have hoped for good, but evil came instead; I have hoped for light, but darkness came.
18Jb 30:27 I'm boiling mad inside, and I won't remain silent; the time for my affliction to confront me has arrived.
18Jb 30:28 "In growing darkness, I walked without sunlight; I stood in the congregation to cry for help.
18Jb 30:29 I've become a brother to jackals, and a friend to ostriches.
18Jb 30:30 My skin turns black all over me; and my bones seem burned from the heat.
18Jb 30:31 But my harp is in mourning; my flute plays only songs for those who are weeping."
18Jb 31:1 "I made a covenant with my eyes; how, then, can I focus my attention on a virgin?
18Jb 31:2 What would I have from God above, what heritage from the Almighty on high,
18Jb 31:3 if not calamity that is due the unjust, and misfortune that is due those who practice iniquity?
18Jb 31:4 He watches my life, observing every one of my actions, does he not?"
18Jb 31:5 "If I've lived my life in the company of vanity, or ran quickly to embrace deception,
18Jb 31:6 let my righteousness be weighed in honest scales, and God will make known my integrity.
18Jb 31:7 If I have stepped away from the way, or if my heart covets whatever my eyes see, or if some other blemish clings to my hands,
18Jb 31:8 what I've planted, let another eat or let my crops be uprooted."
18Jb 31:9 "If my heart has been seduced by a woman and I've laid in wait at my friend's door,
18Jb 31:10 then let my wife cook for another person and may someone else sleep with her,
18Jb 31:11 because something as lascivious as that is an iniquity that should be judged.
18Jb 31:12 The fires of Abaddon will burn, disrupting every part of my eternal reward."
18Jb 31:13 "If I've refused to help my male and female servants when they complain against me,
18Jb 31:14 what will I do when God stands up to act? When he asks the questions, how will I answer him?
18Jb 31:15 The one who made me in the womb made them, too, didn't he? Didn't the same one prepare each of us in the womb?"
18Jb 31:16 "If I refused to grant the desire of the poor or exhausted the eyes of the widow,
18Jb 31:17 if I ate my meals by myself without feeding orphans,
18Jb 31:18 (even a poor man had grown up with me as if I were his father, and even though I had guided the widow from the time I was born)
18Jb 31:19 "If I've observed someone who is about to die for lack of clothes or if I have no clothing to give to the poor,
18Jb 31:20 if he hadn't thanked me from the bottom of his heart, if he had not been warmed by wool from my sheep,
18Jb 31:21 if I've raised my hand against an orphan when I thought I would against him in court,
18Jb 31:22 then let my arm fall from its socket; and may my arm be torn off at the shoulder.
18Jb 31:23 For I'm terrified of what calamity God may have in store for me; and I cannot endure his grandeur."
18Jb 31:24 "If I've put my confidence in gold, if I've said to gold, 'You're my security,'
18Jb 31:25 if I've found joy in great wealth that I own, if I've earned a lot with my own hands,
18Jb 31:26 if I look at the sun when it shines or the moon as it rises in steady splendor,
18Jb 31:27 so that in the depths of my deceived heart I worshipped them with my mouth and hands,
18Jb 31:28 this is also a sin that deserves to be judged, since I would have tried to deceive God above."
18Jb 31:29 "Have I rejoiced in the destruction of those who hate me, or have I been happy that evil caught up with him?
18Jb 31:30 No, I haven't allowed my mouth to sin by asking for his life with a curse.
18Jb 31:31 People in my household have said, 'We cannot find anyone who has not been satisfied with his meat,' haven't they?
18Jb 31:32 No stranger ever spent the night in the street, because I opened my doors to travelers."
18Jb 31:33 "Have I covered my transgression like other people, to conceal iniquity within myself?
18Jb 31:34 Have I feared large crowds? Have my family's contempt ever terrified me so that I remained silent and wouldn't go outside."
18Jb 31:35 "Who will grant me a hearing? Here's my signature?let the Almighty answer! Since my adversary indicted me,
18Jb 31:36 I'll carry wear it on my shoulder, or tie it on my head for a crown!
18Jb 31:37 I'll give an account for every step I've taken; I'll approach him confidently like a commander-in-chief."
18Jb 31:38 "If my land were to cry out against me or if all its furrows wept as one,
18Jb 31:39 If I've consumed its produce without paying for it and snuffed out the life of its owners;
18Jb 31:40 may thorns spring up instead of wheat, and obnoxious weeds instead of barley." With this, Job's discourse with his friends is completed.
18Jb 32:1 These three men stopped responding to Job, because he was claiming to be righteous, in his own opinion.
18Jb 32:2 But then Barachel's son Elihu from Buz, one of Ram's descendants, got really angry. He was furious with Job because he had been declaring himself righteous instead of vindicating God.
18Jb 32:3 Furthermore, he was furious with his three friends because they had not answered Job, but instead had condemned him.
18Jb 32:4 Elihu waited to have a word with Job, since the others were older than he,
18Jb 32:5 but when he saw that there had been no response from those three, he got even more angry.
18Jb 32:6 Barachel's son Elihu from Buz responded and said£º "I'm younger than you are. Because you're older, I was terrified to tell you what I know.
18Jb 32:7 I thought, experience should speak; abundance of years teaches wisdom.
18Jb 32:8 However, a spirit exists in mankind, and the Almighty's breath gives him insight.
18Jb 32:9 "The aged aren't always wise, nor do the elderly always understand justice.
18Jb 32:10 Therefore I'm saying, 'Listen to me!' Then I'll declare what I know.
18Jb 32:11 "Look! I have waited to hear your speech, so I listened to your insights while you searched for the right words to say.
18Jb 32:12 Indeed, I paid close attention to you all, but none of you were able to refute Job or answer his arguments convincingly.
18Jb 32:13 "So that you cannot claim, 'We have found wisdom!' let God do the rebuking, not man;
18Jb 32:14 let him not direct a rebuke toward me. I won't be responding to him with your arguments.
18Jb 32:15 "Job's friends won't reason with him anymore; discouraged, words escape them.
18Jb 32:16 Shall I continue to wait, since they're no longer talking? After all, they're only standing there; they're no longer responding.
18Jb 32:17 "I will contribute my arguments as an answer; I'll declare what I know,32
18Jb 32:18 because I'm filled with things to say, and my spirit within me compels me to speak.
18Jb 32:19 My insides feel like unvented wine, like it's about to burst like a new wineskin.
18Jb 32:20 "Let me speak! I need relief! Let me open my lips and respond.
18Jb 32:21 I won't discriminate against anyone,32 and I won't flatter any person,
18Jb 32:22 since I don't know the first thing about how to flatter; and the one who made me would sweep me away as if I were nothing."
18Jb 33:1 "Now please listen to what I have to say, Job. Listen to every word!
18Jb 33:2 Look! I've begun to speak, and I'm fashioning my words.
18Jb 33:3 I speak from the innocence of my heart; and my lips will utter what I sincerely know.
18Jb 33:4 "The spirit of God fashioned me; and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. 
18Jb 33:5 Answer me, if you can! Present your case! Take your stand in my presence!
18Jb 33:6 Look! As far as God is concerned, I'm just like you are? I, too, have been pinched off from a piece of clay.
18Jb 33:7 Don't be afraid of me; I'll go easy on you."
18Jb 33:8 "You spoke clearly so I could hear; I've heard what you've said£º
18Jb 33:9 'I'm pure. I'm without sin; I'm innocent. I'm harboring no iniquity inside of me.
18Jb 33:10 Nevertheless, God has found a pretext to attack me; he considers me his enemy.
18Jb 33:11 He has bound my feet in shackles, and keeps watching everything I do.'"
18Jb 33:12 "You aren't right about this; My response is that God is greater than human beings. 
18Jb 33:13 Why are you arguing with him? He doesn't have to give explanations for what he does to you!
18Jb 33:14 "God speaks time and time again? but nobody notices?
18Jb 33:15 in a dream or night vision, when a deep sleep falls on mankind while they sleep on their beds.
18Jb 33:16 That's when he opens the ear of mankind, authenticating his messages to them,
18Jb 33:17 turning a person from his actions, keeping him from pride,
18Jb 33:18 sparing his soul from the Pit and his life from violent death.
18Jb 33:19 "Job is being reproved by painful bedrest, with continuous aching in his bones.
18Jb 33:20 He cannot stand his food, and he has no desire for appetizing food.
18Jb 33:21 His flesh wastes away; his bones, which once couldn't be seen, are visible.
18Jb 33:22 His soul is getting close to the Pit; his life is approaching its executioner."
18Jb 33:23 "If there's a messenger appointed to mediate for Job? one out of a thousand? to represent the man's integrity on his behalf,
18Jb 33:24 to show favor to him and to plead, 'Deliver him from having to go down to the Pit? I know where his ransom is!'
18Jb 33:25 Let his flesh be rejuvenated as he was in his youth! Let him recover the strength of his youth.
18Jb 33:26 Let him pray to God and he will accept him; he will appear before him with joyful shouts!"
18Jb 33:27 "He'll sing to mankind with these words£º 'I've sinned. I have twisted what is right. Yet he has not repaid me like I deserve.
18Jb 33:28 He has redeemed my soul from going down to the Pit; my life will see the light.'
18Jb 33:29 Indeed God does all these things again and again with a person
18Jb 33:30 to bring back his soul from the Pit; to light him with the light of life."
18Jb 33:31 "Job, pay attention! Listen to me! Be silent and let me speak.
18Jb 33:32 If you have anything to say, answer me; speak up, because I'd be happy to vindicate you.
18Jb 33:33 But if you have nothing to say, then at least listen to me! Be quiet and learn some wisdom from me."
18Jb 34:1 Elihu continued speaking, and said£º
18Jb 34:2 "Listen to what I have to say, you wise men! Pay attention to me, you educated people!
18Jb 34:3 Since the ear tests words like a palate tastes food,
18Jb 34:4 let's choose what's right for us. Let's consider among ourselves what is good."
18Jb 34:5 Now this is Job's claim£º 'Even though I'm innocent, God has stopped treating me righteously.
18Jb 34:6 Have I lied concerning the justice that I deserve? My wound is incurable, though transgression cannot be attributed to me.'
18Jb 34:7 "What man is like Job, who drinks mockery like water,
18Jb 34:8 traffics in evildoers, and walks with wicked people?
18Jb 34:9 Because he says, 'There's no profit for a man to find joy with God.'"
18Jb 34:10 "Therefore you men of understanding, listen to me! Far be it for God to practice wickedness, or the Almighty to do what is wrong,
18Jb 34:11 because he repays a person for his behavior; and according to a person's conduct, he lets it happen to him.
18Jb 34:12 Truly, God doesn't practice wickedness, and the Almighty doesn't pervert justice.
18Jb 34:13 Who entrusted the earth to him? Who made him responsible for the entire inhabited world?
18Jb 34:14 If he were to decide to do so, that is, to take back to himself his spirit and breath of life,
18Jb 34:15 every living thing would die all at once, and mankind would return to dust."
18Jb 34:16 If you have understanding, listen to this! Pay attention to what I have to say£º
18Jb 34:17 Can one who hates justice really govern? And if God is righteous and mighty, can you condemn him?
18Jb 34:18 Can one say to a king, 'You're vile!' or to nobles, 'You're wicked!'? 
18Jb 34:19 Who isn't partial to princes? Who doesn't gives preference to the nobles over the poor? Nevertheless, all of them are his handiwork.
18Jb 34:20 "They die suddenly, in the middle of the night; people suffer seizures and pass away; even valiant men can be taken away? and not by human hands.
18Jb 34:21 Yes, Job, his eyes constantly watch the behavior of human beings; he carefully observes their every step.
18Jb 34:22 There's no such thing as darkness to him? not even deep darkness? that can conceal those who practice evil.
18Jb 34:23 He won't examine mankind further, that they would go before God to judgment.
18Jb 34:24 He shatters valiant men without a need to investigate, and he raises others in their place.
18Jb 34:25 Thus he acknowledges their behavior, and overcomes them; when night time comes, they are crushed.
18Jb 34:26 "He strikes the wicked among them in a place where they can be seen
18Jb 34:27 because they've abandoned their pursuit of him and had no respect for any of his ways.
18Jb 34:28 As a result, the cries of the poor have reached him and he has heard the cry of the afflicted.
18Jb 34:29 "If he is remains silent, who will condemn him? If he conceals his face, who can see him? He watches over both nation and individual alike,
18Jb 34:30 to keep the godless man from reigning or laying a snare for the people."
18Jb 34:31 "Has anyone ever really said to God, 'I've endured, and I won't act corruptly anymore.
18Jb 34:32 What I don't see, instruct me! If I've done anything evil, I won't repeat it!'
18Jb 34:33 "Should you not be paid back, since you have rejected him? You do the choosing! I won't! Tell us what you know!
18Jb 34:34 "Men of understanding, speak to me! Are any of you men wise? Then listen to me!
18Jb 34:35 Job has been speaking from his own ignorance, and what he has to say lacks insight!
18Jb 34:36 Oh, how Job needs to be be given a full court trial, as a rebuke to those who practice evil,
18Jb 34:37 because he has been adding rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us, and keeps on ranting against God."
18Jb 35:1 In response, Elihu said£º
18Jb 35:2 "Are you saying that it's just for you to claim, 'I'm more righteous than God?'
18Jb 35:3 After all, you've asked what your benefit will be£º 'What will I profit from refraining from sin?'
18Jb 35:4 I'm going to respond to that statement, and to your friends with you."
18Jb 35:5 "Observe the heavens! Take a look around! Look! The clouds are higher than you, aren't they?
18Jb 35:6 If you sin, what will that do to harm him? If you add transgression to transgression what will it do to him?
18Jb 35:7 If you are righteous, what will you add to him? What can God receive from your efforts?
18Jb 35:8 Your wickedness affects only yourself; and your righteousness, only human beings.
18Jb 35:9 "They cry out because they have many oppressors; they cry for help because the powerful are abusing them.
18Jb 35:10 He never asks, 'Where is God, my Creator, who gives me songs in the night,
18Jb 35:11 who teaches us more than the earth's wild animals, and makes us wiser than the birds of the sky.'
18Jb 35:12 "They cry out there, but he doesn't answer because of the arrogance of the those who practice evil.
18Jb 35:13 Theirs is a useless plea? God won't listen; the Almighty won't pay any attention.
18Jb 35:14 Even though you complain that you can't perceive him, your case is already pending for judgment in his presence so keep on placing your hope in him.
18Jb 35:15 "So now, if he doesn't inflict punishment in his anger, then he doesn't keep track of your many transgressions.
18Jb 35:16 When he began speaking, he communicated only worthlessness; he added words upon words without knowing anything."
18Jb 36:1 Elihu responded again and said£º
18Jb 36:2 "Be patient with me a moment longer, and I'll show you that there's more to say on God's behalf.
18Jb 36:3 I'll take what I know to its logical conclusion and ascribe righteousness to my Creator,
18Jb 36:4 because what I have to say isn't deceptive, and the one who has perfect knowledge is with you."
18Jb 36:5 "Indeed God is mighty and he doesn't show disrespect; he is mighty and strong of heart.
18Jb 36:6 He doesn't let the wicked live; he grants justice to the afflicted.
18Jb 36:7 He won't stop looking at righteous people; he seats them on thrones with kings forever, and they are exalted.
18Jb 36:8 "If they're bound in chains, caught in ropes of affliction,
18Jb 36:9 he'll reveal their actions to them, when their transgressions have become excessive.
18Jb 36:10 He opens their ears and instructs them, commanding them to repent from evil.
18Jb 36:11 If they listen and serve him, they'll finish their lives in prosperity and their years will be pleasant.
18Jb 36:12 "But if they won't listen, they'll perish by the sword and die in their ignorance.
18Jb 36:13 The godless at heart cherishes anger; they won't cry out for help when God afflicts them.
18Jb 36:14 They die in their youth; and their life will end among temple prostitutes.
18Jb 36:15 He'll deliver the afflicted through their afflictions and open their ears when they are oppressed."
18Jb 36:16 "Indeed, he drew you away from the brink of distress to a spacious place without constraints, filleing your festive table with bountiful food.
18Jb 36:17 But now you are occupied with the case of the wicked; but justice and judgment will be served.
18Jb 36:18 So that no one entices you with riches, don't let a large ransom turn you astray.
18Jb 36:19 "Will your wealth sustain you when you're in distress, despite your most powerful efforts?
18Jb 36:20 Don't long for night, when people vanish in their place.36
18Jb 36:21 Be careful! Don't turn to evil, because of this you will be tried by more than affliction.
18Jb 36:22 "Indeed, God is exalted in his power. Who is like him as a teacher?
18Jb 36:23 Who ordained his path for him, and who has asked him, "You are wrong?'
18Jb 36:24 Remember to magnify his awesome activities, about which mortal man has sung.36
18Jb 36:25 All of mankind sees him; human beings observe him from afar off."
18Jb 36:26 "God is truly awesome, beyond what we know; the number of his years is unknowable.
18Jb 36:27 He draws up drops of water, distilling it to rain and mist.
18Jb 36:28 When the clouds pour down; they drop their rain on all of humanity.
18Jb 36:29 "Furthermore, can anyone understand cloud patterns, or the thundering in his pavilion?
18Jb 36:30 He scatters his lightning above it, and covers the bottom of the sea.
18Jb 36:31 He uses them to judge some people and give food to many.
18Jb 36:32 His hands are covered with lightning that he commands to strike his designated target.
18Jb 36:33 His thunder declares his presence; and tells the animals what is coming."
18Jb 37:1 "Now I'll conclude with this£º my heart is trembling violently; it feels like it's about to leap from my body!
18Jb 37:2 Listen carefully to his thundering voice; to the sound that rumbles from his mouth.
18Jb 37:3 He releases his lightning throughout the sky, to the ends of the earth.
18Jb 37:4 His thunder roars after it; his majestic voice will thunder; and no one can trace them once his voice has been heard.
18Jb 37:5 "God thunders with his wondrous voice; he does awesome works that we don't comprehend.
18Jb 37:6 For he says to the snow, 'Fall to the earth.' He tells the rain, 'Pour down,' then it rains profusely.
18Jb 37:7 "He puts a limit to the skill of every person; to delineate all people from what they do.
18Jb 37:8 "Then a beast enters its lair and remains in its den.
18Jb 37:9 "From the south a whirlwind proceed, out of the icy north winds.
18Jb 37:10 From the breath of God ice is produced, and a wide body of water is frozen.
18Jb 37:11 He also loads the clouds with moisture, scattering his lightning with the clouds.
18Jb 37:12 It whirls about in circles at his direction to accomplish all that he commands throughout the surface of the entire world,
18Jb 37:13 whether for discipline on his land or to demonstrate his gracious love, he causes it to be realized."
18Jb 37:14 "Pay attention to this, Job! Stand still, and consider the wonderous attributes of God.
18Jb 37:15 Do you know how God ordains them, and makes his lightning to flash throughout his clouds?
18Jb 37:16 Do you understand his wondrous work of balancing the clouds, the one whose knowledge is perfect,
18Jb 37:17 you whose garments are hot, even though the land is cooled by a south wind?
18Jb 37:18 Can you spread out the skies like he does; can you cast them as one might a mirror?
18Jb 37:19 Tell us! What are we to say to him? Can we prepare our case to face him when our faces are in darkness?
18Jb 37:20 Has it been relayed to God that I want to talk? Can a person speak when he is confused?"
18Jb 37:21 "So then, the sun is too bright to gaze at, is it not? The sky is swept clean by the wind that blows, is it not?
18Jb 37:22 From the north he brings gold; around God is awesome splendor.
18Jb 37:23 We cannot find the Almighty? he is majestic in power and justice, and overflowing with righteousness; he never oppresses.
18Jb 37:24 Therefore humanity fears him, which none of the wise can quite comprehend."
18Jb 38:1 The Lord responded to Job from the whirlwind and said£º
18Jb 38:2 "Who is this who keeps darkening my counsel without knowing what he's talking about?
18Jb 38:3 Stand up like a man! I'll ask you some questions, and you give me some answers!"
18Jb 38:4 "Where were you when I laid the foundation of my earth? Tell me, since you're so informed!
18Jb 38:5 Who set its measurement? Shall I assume you know? Who stretched a boundary line over it?
18Jb 38:6 On what were its bases set? Who laid its corner stone
18Jb 38:7 while the morning stars sang together and all the divine beings shouted joyfully?
18Jb 38:8 "Who enclosed the sea with limits when it gushed out of the womb,
18Jb 38:9 when I made clouds to be its clothes and thick darkness its swaddling blanket,
18Jb 38:10 when I proscribed a boundary for it, set in place bars and doors for it;
18Jb 38:11 and said, 'You may come only this far and no more. Your majestic waves will stop here.'?
18Jb 38:12 "Have you ever commanded the morning at any time during your life? Do you know where the dawn lives,
18Jb 38:13 where it seizes the edge of the earth and shakes the wicked out of it?
18Jb 38:14 Like clay is molded by a signet ring, the earth's hills and valleys then stand out like the colors of a garment.
18Jb 38:15 Then from the wicked their light is withheld and their upraised arm is broken.
18Jb 38:16 "Have you been to the source of the sea and walked about in the recesses of the deepest ocean?
18Jb 38:17 Have the gates of death been revealed to you? Have you seen the gates of the deepest darkness?
18Jb 38:18 Do you understand the breadth of the earth? Tell me, since you know it all!
18Jb 38:19 "Where is the road to where the light lives? Or where does the darkness live?
18Jb 38:20 Can you take it to its homeland, since you know the path to his house?
18Jb 38:21 You should know! After all, you had been born back then, so the number of your days is great!
18Jb 38:22 "Have you entered the storehouses of the snow or seen where the hail is stored,
18Jb 38:23 which I've reserved for the tribulation to come, for the day of battle and war?
18Jb 38:24 Where is the lightning diffused or the east wind scattered around the earth?
18Jb 38:25 "Who cuts canals for storm floods, and paths for the lightning and thunder,
18Jb 38:26 to bring rain upon a land without inhabitants, a desert in which no human beings live,
18Jb 38:27 to satisfy a desolate and devastated desert, causing it to sprout vegetation?
18Jb 38:28 "Does the rain have a father? Who fathered the dew?
18Jb 38:29 Whose womb brings forth the ice? Who gives birth to frost out of an empty sky,
18Jb 38:30 when water solidifies like stone and the surface of the deepest sea freezes?
18Jb 38:31 "Can you bind the chains of Pleiades or loosen the cords of Orion?
18Jb 38:32 Can you bring out constellations in their season? Can you guide the Bear with her cubs?
18Jb 38:33 Do you know the laws of the heavens? Can you regulate their authority over the earth?
18Jb 38:34 "Can you call out to the clouds, so that abundant water drenches you?
18Jb 38:35 Can you command the lightning, so that it goes forth and calls to you, 'Look at us!'38
18Jb 38:36 "Who sets wisdom within you, or imbues your mind with understanding?
18Jb 38:37 Who has the wisdom to be able to count the clouds, or to empty the water jars of heaven,
18Jb 38:38 when dust dries into a mass and then breaks apart into clods?
18Jb 38:39 "Can you hunt prey for the lioness to satisfy young lions
18Jb 38:40 when they crouch in their dens and lie in ambush in their lairs?
18Jb 38:41 Who prepares food for the raven, when its offspring cry out to God as they wander for lack of food?"
18Jb 39:1 "Do you know when the mountain goat gives birth? Do you watch the doe as it calves its young?
18Jb 39:2 Can you count the months of their gestation? Do you know the time when they give birth,
18Jb 39:3 when they crouch down to give birth to their offspring, and let go of their birth pangs?
18Jb 39:4 Their young are strong; they grow up in the open field; then they go off and don't return to them."
18Jb 39:5 "Who sets the wild donkey free? Who loosens the bonds of the wild donkey
18Jb 39:6 to whom I've given the Arabah for a home; the salt plain for his dwelling place?
18Jb 39:7 He despises city noises; he ignores the shouts of the driver.
18Jb 39:8 He ranges the mountains that are his pasture to search for anything green.
18Jb 39:9 Is the wild ox willing to serve you? Will he sleep at night near your feeding trough?
18Jb 39:10 Can you bind the ox to plow a furrow with a rope? Will he harrow after you in the valley?
18Jb 39:11 Will you trust him because of his great strength and entrust your labor to him?
18Jb 39:12 Will you trust him that he'll bring in your grain, and gather it to your threshing floor?"
18Jb 39:13 "The wings of the ostrich flap joyously, but aren't its pinions and feathers like the stork?
18Jb 39:14 She abandons her eggs on the ground and lets them be warmed in the sand,
18Jb 39:15 but she forgets that a foot might crush them or any wild animal might trample them.
18Jb 39:16 She mistreats her young as though they're not hers, and she has no fear that her labor may be in vain,
18Jb 39:17 because God didn't grant her wisdom and never gave her understanding.
18Jb 39:18 And yet when she gets ready to run, she laughs at the horse and its rider."
18Jb 39:19 Do you instill the horse with strength? Do you clothe its neck with a mane?
18Jb 39:20 Can you make him leap like the locust, and make the splendor of his snorting terrifying?
18Jb 39:21 He paws the ground in the valley and rejoices in his strength; he goes out to face weapons.
18Jb 39:22 He scoffs at fear and is never scared; he never retreats from a sword.
18Jb 39:23 A quiver of arrows rattles against his side, along with a flashing spear and a lance.
18Jb 39:24 Leaping in his excitement, he takes in the ground; he cannot stand still when the trumpets sound!
18Jb 39:25 When the trumpet blasts he'll neigh, 'Aha! Aha!' From a distance he can sense war, the war cry of generals, and their shouting."
18Jb 39:26 "Is it by your understanding that the hawk flies, spreading its wings toward the south?
18Jb 39:27 Does the eagle soar high at your command and build its nest on the highest crags?
18Jb 39:28 He dwells on the crags where he makes his home, there on the rocky crag is his stronghold.
18Jb 39:29 From there he searches for prey, and his eyes recognize it from a distance.
18Jb 39:30 His young ones feast on blood; he'll be found wherever there's a carcass."
18Jb 40:1 The Lord continued his response to Job by saying£º
18Jb 40:2 "Should the one who is fighting the Almighty find fault with him? Let God's accuser answer."
18Jb 40:3 Then Job replied to the Lord. He said£º
18Jb 40:4 "I must look insignificant to you! How can I answer you? I'm speechless.
18Jb 40:5 I spoke once, but I can't answer; I tried a second time, but I won't do so any more."
18Jb 40:6 The Lord answered Job from the wind storm and told him£º
18Jb 40:7 "Stand up like a man! I'll ask you some questions, and you give me some answers!
18Jb 40:8 Indeed would you annul my justice and condemn me, just so you can claim that you're righteous?
18Jb 40:9 Do you have strength like God? Can you create thunder with a sound like he can?"
18Jb 40:10 "When you have adorned yourself with exalted majesty, clothed yourself with splendor and dignity,
18Jb 40:11 dispensed the fury of your anger, made sure that you have humbled every proud person,
18Jb 40:12 stared down and subdued every proud person, trampled the wicked right where they are,
18Jb 40:13 buried them in the dust together, and sent them bound to that secret place,
18Jb 40:14 then I will applaud you myself! I'll admit that you can deliver yourself by your own efforts!"
18Jb 40:15 "Please observe Behemoth, which I made along with you. He eats grass like an ox.
18Jb 40:16 Now take a look at the strength that he has in his loins, and in the muscles of his abdomen.
18Jb 40:17 His tail protrudes stiffly, like cedar; the sinews of his thigh interlink for strength.
18Jb 40:18 His bones are conduits of bronze; his strong bones are like bars of iron.
18Jb 40:19 He is the grandest of God's undertakings, yet his creator is approaching him with his sword.

18Jb 41:30 "Beneath him he is armoured as with sharp potsherds; he tears through muddy ground like a threshing sledge through grain.
18Jb 41:31 He causes the deep to boil like water in a pot, and churns the sea like one stirs ointment.
18Jb 41:32 The sea is luminescent behind him; his wake turns the sea white, like those with gray hair.

18Jb 42:2 "I know that you can do anything and nothing that you plan is impossible.
18Jb 42:3 You asked, 'Who is this that darkens counsel without knowledge?' Well now, I have talked about what I don't understand? awesome things beyond me that I don't know.
18Jb 42:4 Listen now, and I will speak for myself; I'll interrogate you and then inform me.
18Jb 42:5 I've heard you with my ears; and now I've seen you with my eyes.
18Jb 42:6 As a result, I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes."
18Jb 42:7 After these words had been spoken by the Lord to Job, the Lord spoke to Eliphaz from Teman£º "My anger is burning against you along with your two friends, since you haven't spoken correctly about me, as did my servant Job.
18Jb 42:8 So take seven bulls and seven rams and bring them to my servant Job. And bring a whole burnt offering for yourselves and my servant Job will pray for you. I'll encourage him by not responding as your disgraceful folly deserves, since you didn't speak about me correctly as did my servant Job.
18Jb 42:9 So Eliphaz from Teman, Bildad from Shuah, and Zophar from Naamath did precisely as the Lord had spoken to them, because the Lord showed favor to Job.
18Jb 42:10 The Lord restored Job's prosperity after he prayed for his friends. The Lord doubled everything that Job had once possessed.
18Jb 42:11 Then all his brothers and sisters and all those who knew him before arrived. They ate food with him in his house, mourned for him, and consoled him for all the trouble that the Lord had brought and placed on him. Some gave him gold bullion and some brought gold earrings.
18Jb 42:12 The Lord blessed Job during the latter part of his life more than the former, since he owned 14,000 thousand sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 team of oxen and 1,000 female donkeys.
18Jb 42:13 He also had seven sons and three daughters.
18Jb 42:14 He named the first daughter Jemima, the second Keziah, and the name of the third was Keren-Happuch.
18Jb 42:15 No one could find more beautiful women in the whole land than Job's daughters. Their father gave them their inheritance along with their brothers.
18Jb 42:16 Job lived
18Jb 42:14 0 years after this, and saw his children and grandchildren to the fourth generation.
18Jb 42:17 Then Job died at an old age, having lived a full life.

19Ps 35:14 I paced about as for my friend or my brother, and fell down mourning as one weeps for one's mother.
19Ps 35:15 But when I stumbled, they rejoiced and gathered together. They gathered together against me?attackers whom I did not know. They tore me apart and would not stop.

19Ps 36:1 An oracle that came to me about the transgressions of the wicked£º There is no fear of God before his eyes.

19Ps 37:35 I once observed a wicked and oppressive person, flourishing like a green tree in native soil.
19Ps 37:36 But then he passed away; in fact, he simply was not there. When I looked for him, he could not be found.

19Ps 38:5 My wounds have putrefied and festered because of my foolishness.

19Ps 38:7 My insides are burning and my body is unhealthy.
19Ps 38:8 I am weak and utterly crushed; I cry out in distress because of my heart's anguish.
19Ps 38:9 Lord, all my longings are before you, and my groaning is not hidden from you.
19Ps 38:10 My heart pounds, my strength fails me, even the gleam in my eye is gone.
19Ps 38:11 As for my friends and my neighbors, they stand aloof from my distress; even my close relatives stand at a distance.
19Ps 38:12 Those who seek my life lay snares for me; those who seek to do me harm brag all day long about their wicked planning.
19Ps 38:13 I am like the deaf, who cannot hear, and like the mute, who cannot open his mouth.
19Ps 38:14 Indeed, I have become like a man who hears nothing, and in whose mouth there is no rebuke.
19Ps 38:15 Because I have placed my hope in you, LORD, you will answer, Lord, my God.
19Ps 38:16 For I said, "Do not let them gloat over me, as they congratulate themselves when my foot slips."
19Ps 38:17 Indeed, I am being set up for a fall, and I am continually reminded of my pain.
19Ps 38:18 I confess my iniquity, and my sin troubles me.

19Ps 38:22 Come quickly and help me, Lord, my deliverer.
19Ps 39:1 I told myself, "I will keep watch over my tongue to keep from sinning. I will muzzle my mouth when the wicked are around."
19Ps 39:2 I was as silent as a mute person; I said nothing, not even something good, and my distress deepened.
19Ps 39:3 My heart within me became incensed; as I thought about it, the fire burned. Then I spoke out£º
19Ps 39:4 "LORD, let me know how my life ends, and the standard by which you will measure my days, whatever it is! Then I will know how transient my life is.
19Ps 39:5 Look, you have made my life span fit in your hand; It is nothing compared to yours. Surely every person at their best is a puff of wind. Interlude
19Ps 39:6 In fact, people walk around as shadows. Surely, they busy themselves for nothing, heaping up possessions but not knowing who will get them.
19Ps 39:7 How long, Lord, will I wait expectantly? I have placed my hope in you.
19Ps 39:8 Deliver me from all my transgressions, and do not let fools scorn me."
19Ps 39:9 I remain silent; I do not open my mouth, for you are the one who acted
19Ps 39:10 Stop scourging me, since I have been crushed by your heavy hand.
19Ps 39:11 You rebuke by chastening a man with the consequence of iniquities; you destroy what is attractive to him, as one would treat a moth. Indeed, every person is a puff of wind. Interlude
19Ps 39:12 Hear my prayer, LORD, pay attention to my cry, and do not ignore my tears. I am an alien in your presence, a stranger just like my ancestors were.
19Ps 39:13 Stop looking at me with chastisement, so I can smile again, before I depart and am no more.
19Ps 40:1 I waited expectantly for the LORD, and he took notice of me and heard my cry.
19Ps 40:2 He plucked me out of a pit of confusion, even out of the quicksand; he placed my feet on a rock and established my steps.
19Ps 40:3 He put a new song in my mouth, praise to our God! Many will watch and be in awe, and they will place their trust in the LORD.
19Ps 40:4 How blessed is that strong person who places his trust in the LORD, and who has not acknowledged the proud nor resorted to lies.

19Ps 40:6 You take no delight in sacrifices and offerings?you have prepared my ears to listen?you require no burnt offerings or sacrifices for sin.
19Ps 40:7 Then I said, "Here I am! I have come! In the scroll of the book it is written about me.
19Ps 40:8 I delight to do your will, my God. Your law is part of my inner being."
19Ps 40:9 In the great congregation I have proclaimed the righteous good news. Behold, I did not seal my lips, LORD, as you know.
19Ps 40:10 I have not ignored your righteousness in my heart; instead, I have proclaimed your faithfulness and deliverance. I have not concealed your gracious love and truthfulness from the great congregation.
19Ps 40:11 LORD, do not withhold your mercy from me, for your gracious love and truthfulness will keep me safe continuously.
19Ps 40:12 Innumerable evils have surrounded me; my iniquities have overtaken me so that I cannot see. They are more in number than the hair on my head, and my courage has forsaken me.
19Ps 40:13 Be pleased, LORD, to deliver me; LORD, hurry up and help me!
19Ps 40:14 May those who seek to destroy my life be ashamed and confounded; let them be driven backwards and humiliated, particularly those who wish me evil.
19Ps 40:15 Let shame be the reward for those who say to me, "Aha! Aha!"
19Ps 40:16 Let all who seek you shout for joy and be glad in you. May those who love your deliverance say, "The LORD be magnified!" continuously.
19Ps 40:17 But I am poor and needy; may the Lord think about me. You are my help and deliverer. My God, do not tarry too long!
19Ps 41:1 Blessed is the one who is considerate of the destitute; the LORD will deliver him when the times are evil.
19Ps 41:2 The LORD will protect him and keep him alive; he will be blessed in the land; and he will not be handed over to the desires of his enemies.

19Ps 41:4 As for me, I said, "LORD, be gracious to me! Heal me, for I have sinned against you!"
19Ps 41:5 As for my enemies, with malice they said, "When will he die and memory of his name perish?"
19Ps 41:6 The one who comes to visit me speaks lies; in his heart he thinks slanderous things about me and goes around spreading them.
19Ps 41:7 As for all who hate me, they whisper together against me; they desire to do me harm.
19Ps 41:8 They say, "Wickedness is entrenched in him. Once he is brought low, he will not rise again."
19Ps 41:9 As for my best friend, the one in whom I trusted, the one who ate my bread, even he has insulted me!
19Ps 41:10 But you, LORD, be gracious to me and raise me up so that I may pay them back!
19Ps 41:11 In this way I will know that you are pleased with me, and that my enemies will not shout in triumph over me.
19Ps 41:12 As for me, you will maintain my just cause, and you will cause me to stand in your presence forever.
19Ps 41:13 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, from eternity to eternity. Amen and amen!
19Ps 42:1 As an antelope pants for streams of water, so my soul pants for you, God.
19Ps 42:2 My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When may I come and appear in God's presence?
19Ps 42:3 My tears have been my food day and night, while people keep asking me all day long, "Where is your God?"
19Ps 42:4 These things I will recall as I pour out my troubles within me£º I used to go with the crowd in a procession to the house of God, accompanied with shouts of joy and thanksgiving.
19Ps 42:5 Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, for once again I will praise him, since his presence saves me.
19Ps 42:6 My God, my soul feels depressed within me; therefore I will remember you from the land of Jordan, from the heights of Hermon, even from the foothills.
19Ps 42:7 Deep waters call out to what is deeper still; at the roar of your waterfalls all your breakers and your waves swirled over me.
19Ps 42:8 By day the LORD will command his gracious love, and by night his song is with me?a prayer to the God of my life.
19Ps 42:9 I will ask God, my Rock, "Why have you forsaken me? Why do I go around mourning under the enemy's oppression?"
19Ps 42:10 Like the shattering of my bones are the taunts of my oppressors, saying to me all day long, "Where is your God?"
19Ps 42:11 Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, for I once again I will praise him, since his presence saves me and he is my God.
19Ps 43:1 You be my judge, God, and plead my case against an unholy nation; rescue me from the deceitful and unjust man.
19Ps 43:2 Since you are the God who strengthens me, why have you forsaken me? Why do I go around mourning under the enemy's oppression?"
19Ps 43:3 Send forth your light and your truth so they may guide me. Let them bring me to your holy mountain and to your dwelling places.
19Ps 43:4 Then I will approach the altar of God, even to God in whom my joy finds its source. Then I will praise you with the lyre, God, my God,
19Ps 43:5 Why are you in despair, my soul? Why are you disturbed within me? Hope in God, because I will praise him once again, since his presence saves me and he is my God.
19Ps 44:1 God, we heard it with our ears; our ancestors told us about what you did in their day?a long time ago.
19Ps 44:2 With your hand you expelled the nations and established our ancestors. You afflicted nations and cast them out.
19Ps 44:3 It was not with their sword that they inherited the land, nor did their own arm deliver them. But it was by your power, your strength, and by the light of your face; because you were pleased with them.
19Ps 44:4 You are my king, God, command victories for Jacob.
19Ps 44:5 Through you we will knock down our oppressors; through your name we will tread down those who rise up against us.
19Ps 44:6 For I place no confidence in my bow, nor will my sword deliver me.
19Ps 44:7 For you delivered us from our oppressors and put to shame those who hate us.

19Ps 44:9 However, you cast us off and made us ashamed! You did not even march with our armies!
19Ps 44:10 You made us retreat from our oppressors. Our enemies ransacked us.
19Ps 44:11 You handed us over to be slaughtered like sheep and you scattered us among the nations.
19Ps 44:12 You sold out your people for nothing, and made no profit at that price.
19Ps 44:13 You made us a laughing stock to our neighbors, a source of mockery and derision to those around us.
19Ps 44:14 You made us an object lesson among the nations; people shake their heads at us.
19Ps 44:15 My dishonor tortures me continuously; the shame on my face overwhelms me
19Ps 44:16 because of the voice of the one who mocks and reviles, because of the enemy and the avenger.
19Ps 44:17 All this came upon us, yet we did not forsake you, and we have not dealt falsely with your covenant;
19Ps 44:18 Our hearts have not turned away; our steps have not swerved from your path.
19Ps 44:19 Nevertheless, you crushed us in the lair of jackals, and covered us in deep darkness.
19Ps 44:20 If we had forgotten the name of our God or lifted our hands to a foreign god,
19Ps 44:21 wouldn't God find out since he knows the secrets of the heart?
19Ps 44:22 For your sake we are being killed all day long. We are thought of as sheep to be slaughtered.
19Ps 44:23 Wake up! Why are you asleep, Lord? Get up! Don't cast us off forever!
19Ps 44:24 Why are you hiding your face? Why are you ignoring our affliction and oppression?
19Ps 44:25 For we have collapsed in the dust; our bodies cling to the ground.

19Ps 45:12 The daughter of Tyre will come with a wedding gift; wealthy people will entreat your favor.

19Ps 78:13 He divided the sea so that they were able to cross;he caused the water to stand in a single location. 
19Ps 78:14 He led them with a cloud during the day, and during the night with light from the fire.
19Ps 78:15 He caused the rocks to split in the wilderness, and gave them water as from an abundant sea. 
19Ps 78:16 He brought streams from rock, causing water to flow like a river.
19Ps 78:17 But time and again, they sinned against him, rebelling against the Most High in the desert.
19Ps 78:18 To test God was in their minds, when they demanded food to satisfy their cravings.
19Ps 78:19 They spoke against God by asking, "Is God able to prepare a feast in the desert?
19Ps 78:20 It's true that Moses struck the rock so that water flowed forth and torrents of water gushed out, but is he also able to give bread or to supply meat for his people?"
19Ps 78:21 Therefore, when the Lord heard this, he was angry, and fire broke out against Jacob. Moreover, his anger flared against Israel,
19Ps 78:22 because they didn't believe in God and didn't trust in his deliverance. 
19Ps 78:23 Yet he commanded the skies above and the doors of the heavens to open,
19Ps 78:24 so that manna rained down on them for food and he sent them the grain of heaven.
19Ps 78:25 Mortal men ate the food of angels; he sent provision to them in abundance.
19Ps 78:26 He stirred up the east wind in the heavens and drove the south wind by his might. 
19Ps 78:27 He caused meat to rain on them like dust and winged birds as the sand of the sea. 
19Ps 78:28 He caused these to fall in the middle of the camp and all around their tents.
19Ps 78:29 So they ate and were very satisfied, because he granted their desire.
19Ps 78:30 However, before they had fulfilled their desire, while their food was still in their mouths,
19Ps 78:31 the anger of God flared against them, and he killed the strongest men and humbled Israel's young men.
19Ps 78:32 In spite of all of this, they kept on sinning and didn't believe in his marvelous deeds.
19Ps 78:33 So he made their days end in futility, and their years with sudden terror.
19Ps 78:34 When he struck them, they sought him; they repented, and eagerly sought God.
19Ps 78:35 Then they remembered that God was their rock, and the Most High God was their deliverer.
19Ps 78:36 But they deceived him with their mouths; they lied to him with their tongues.
19Ps 78:37 For their hearts weren't committed to him, and they weren't faithful to his covenant.
19Ps 78:38 But he, being merciful, forgave their iniquity and didn't destroy them; He restrained his anger and didn't vent all his wrath. 
19Ps 78:39 For he remembered that they were only flesh, a passing wind that doesn't return.
19Ps 78:40 How they rebelled against him in the desert, grieving him in the wilderness!
19Ps 78:41 They tested God again and again, provoking the Holy One of Israel.
19Ps 78:42 They did not remember his power?the day he delivered them from their adversary,
19Ps 78:43 when he set his signs in Egypt and his wonders in the plain of Zoan.
19Ps 78:44 He turned their rivers into blood and made their streams undrinkable.
19Ps 78:45 He sent swarms of insects to bite them and frogs to destroy them.
19Ps 78:46 He gave their crops to caterpillars and what they worked for to locusts.
19Ps 78:47 He destroyed their vines with hail and their sycamore trees with frost.
19Ps 78:48 He delivered their beasts to hail and their livestock to lightning bolts.
19Ps 78:49 He inflicted his burning anger, wrath, indignation, and distress, sending destroying angels among them.
19Ps 78:50 He blazed a path for his anger; he did not stop short from killing them, but handed them over to pestilence.
19Ps 78:51 He struck every firstborn in Egypt, the first fruits of their manhood in the tents of Ham.
19Ps 78:52 Yet he led out his people like sheep, guiding them like a flock in the desert.
19Ps 78:53 He led them to safety so they would not fear. As for their enemies, the sea covered them.
19Ps 78:54 He brought the people to the border of his holy mountain, which he acquired by his might.
19Ps 78:55 He drove out nations before them and allotted their tribal inheritance, settling the tribes of Israel in their tents.
19Ps 78:56 But they tested the Most High God by rebelling against him, and they did not obey his statutes.
19Ps 78:57 They fell away and were as disloyal as their ancestors. They became unreliable, like a defective bow;
19Ps 78:58 they angered him with their high places and with their carved images they made him jealous.
19Ps 78:59 God heard and became furious, and he completely rejected Israel.
19Ps 78:60 He abandoned the tabernacle at Shiloh, the tent that he established among mankind.
19Ps 78:61 Then he sent his might into captivity and his glory into the control of the adversary.
19Ps 78:62 He delivered his people over to the swordand was angry with his possession.
19Ps 78:63 The young men were consumed by fire, and the virgins had no marriage celebrations.
19Ps 78:64 The priests fell by the sword, yet their widows couldn't weep.
19Ps 78:65 The Lord awoke as though from sleep, like a mighty warrior stimulated by wine.
19Ps 78:66 He beat back his adversaries, permanently disgracing them.
19Ps 78:67 He rejected the clan of Joseph; and the tribe of Ephraim he did not choose.
19Ps 78:68 But he chose the tribe of Judah, the mountain of Zion, which he loves. 
19Ps 78:69 He built his sanctuary, high as the heavens, like the earth that he established forever.
19Ps 78:70 Then he chose his servant David, whom he took from the sheepfold.
19Ps 78:71 He brought him from birthing sheep to care for Jacob, his people, Israel, his possession.
19Ps 78:72 David shepherded them with a devoted heart, and led them with skillful hands.
19Ps 79:1 God, nations have invaded your land to desecrate your holy temple, to destroy Jerusalem,
19Ps 79:2 to give the corpses of your servants as food for the birds of the skies and the flesh of your godly ones to the beasts of the earth;
19Ps 79:3 to make their blood flow like water around Jerusalem, with no one being buried.
19Ps 79:4 We have become a reproach to our neighbors, a mockery and a derision to those around us.
19Ps 79:5 How long, Lord, will you be angry? Forever? Will your jealousy burn like fire? 
19Ps 79:6 Pour out your wrath upon the nations that do not acknowledge you, and over the kingdoms that do not call on your name. 
19Ps 79:7 For they consumed Jacob, making his dwelling place desolate.
19Ps 79:8 Don't charge us for previous iniquity, but let your compassion come quickly to us, for we have been brought very low.
19Ps 79:9 Help us, God, our deliverer, on account of your glorious name, deliver us and forgive our sins on account of your name.
19Ps 79:10 Why should the nations say, "Where is their God?" Let vengeance for the blood of your servants be meted out before our eyes and among the nations.
19Ps 79:11 Let the cries of the prisoners reach you. With the strength of your power, release those condemned to death.
19Ps 79:12 Pay back our neighbors seven times the reproach with which they reproached you, Lord.
19Ps 79:13 Then we, your people, the sheep of your pasture, will praise you always, from generation to generation. We will declare your praise.
19Ps 80:1 Shepherd of Israel, listen! The one who leads Joseph like a flock, the one enthroned on the cherubim, display your glory.
19Ps 80:2 Reveal your power before Ephraim, Benjamin, and Manasseh, then come to our rescue.
19Ps 80:3 God, restore us, show your favor and deliver us.
19Ps 80:4 Lord God of the Heavenly Armies, when will your smoldering anger toward your people's prayers cease?
19Ps 80:5 You fed them tears as their food, and caused them to drink a full measure of tears.
19Ps 80:6 You have set us at strife against our neighbors and our enemies deride us.
19Ps 80:7 God of the Heavenly Armies, restore us and show your favor, so we may be delivered.
19Ps 80:8 You uprooted a vine from Egypt, and drove out nations to transplant it.
19Ps 80:9 You cleared the ground so that its roots grew and filled the land. 
19Ps 80:10 Mountains were covered by its shadows, and the mighty cedars by its branches.
19Ps 80:11 Its branches spread out to the Mediterranean Sea and its shoots to the Euphrates River.
19Ps 80:12 Why did you break down its walls so that those who pass by pluck its fruits?
19Ps 80:13 Wild boars of the forest gnaw at it, and creatures of the field feed on it.
19Ps 80:14 God of the Heavenly Armies, return! Look down from heaven and see. Show care toward this vine. 
19Ps 80:15 The root that your right hand planted, the shoot that you tended for yourself,
19Ps 80:16 was burned with fire, cut off, and destroyed on account of your rebuke.
19Ps 80:17 May you support the man at your right hand; the son of man whom you have raised for yourself.
19Ps 80:18 Then we will not turn away from you. Restore us, so we can call upon your name. 
19Ps 80:19 God of hosts, restore to us the light of your favor. Then we'll be delivered.
19Ps 81:1 Sing joyfully to God, our strength. Raise a shout to the God of Jacob. 
19Ps 81:2 Sing a song and play the tambourine, the pleasant-sounding lyre along with the harp.
19Ps 81:3 Blow the ram's horn when there is a new moon, when there is a full moon, on our festival day,
19Ps 81:4 because it is a statute in Israel, an ordinance by the God of Jacob,
19Ps 81:5 a decree that he prescribed for Joseph when he went throughout the land of Egypt, speaking a language I did not recognize.
19Ps 81:6 I removed the burden from your shoulder; your hands were freed of the burdensome basket.
19Ps 81:7 In a time of need you called out and I delivered you; I answered you from the dark thundercloud; I tested you at the waters of Meribah. Interlude
19Ps 81:8 Listen, My people and I will warn you. Israel, if only you would obey me!
19Ps 81:9 You must neither have a foreign god over you or worship a strange god.
19Ps 81:10 I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, open your mouth that I may fill it.
19Ps 81:11 Yet my people didn't obey my voice; Israel didn't submit to me.
19Ps 81:12 So I allowed them to continue in their stubbornness, living by their own advice.
19Ps 81:13 If only my people would obey me, if only Israel would walk in my ways!
19Ps 81:14 Then I would quickly subdue their enemies. I would turn against their foes.
19Ps 81:15 Those who hate the Lord will cringe before him; their punishment will be permanent.
19Ps 81:16 But I will feed Israel with the finest wheat, satisfying you with honey from the rock.

19Ps 91:3 He will surely deliver you from the hunter's snare and from the destructive plague.
19Ps 91:4 With his feathers he will cover you, under his wings you will find safety. His truth is your shield and armor.

19Ps 91:12 With their hands they will lift you up so you will not trip over a stone.
19Ps 91:13 You will stomp on lions and snakes; you will trample young lions and serpents.
19Ps 91:14 Because he has focused his love on me, I will deliver him. I will protect him because he knows my name.
19Ps 91:15 When he calls out to me, I will answer him. I will be with him in his distress. I will deliver him, and I will honor him.
19Ps 91:16 I will satisfy him with long life; I will show him my deliverance.91

19Ps 94:12 How blessed is the man whom you instruct, Lord, whom you teach from your law,
19Ps 94:13 keeping him calm when times are troubled until a pit has been dug for the wicked.
19Ps 94:14 For the Lord will not forsake his people; he will not abandon his heritage.
19Ps 94:15 Righteousness will be restored with justice, and all the pure of heart will follow it.
19Ps 94:16 Who will rise up for me against the wicked? Who will stand for me against those who practice iniquity?
19Ps 94:17 If the Lord had not been my helper, I would have quickly become silent.
19Ps 94:18 When I say that my foot is shaking, your gracious love, Lord, will sustain me.
19Ps 94:19 When my anxious inner thoughts become overwhelming, your comfort encourages me.
19Ps 94:20 Will destructive national leaders, who plan wicked things through misuse of the law, be allied with you?
19Ps 94:21 They gather together against the righteous, condemning the innocent to death. 
19Ps 94:22 But the Lord is my stronghold, and my God, the rock, is my refuge.
19Ps 94:23 He will repay them for their sin; he will annihilate them because of their evil. The Lord our God will annihilate them.

19Ps 95:8 do not be stubborn like your ancestors were at Meribah, as on that day at Massah, in the wilderness,
19Ps 95:9 where your ancestors tested me. They tested me, even though they had seen my awesome deeds.
19Ps 95:10 For forty years I loathed that generation, so I said, "They are a people whose hearts continually err, and they have not understood my ways."

19Ps 102:19 For when he looked down from his holy heights? the Lord looked over the earth from heaven?
19Ps 102:20 to listen to the groans of prisoners, to set free those condemned to death,
19Ps 102:21 so they would declare the name of the Lord in Zion and his praise in Jerusalem,
19Ps 102:22 when people and kingdoms gather together to serve the Lord.
19Ps 102:23 He has weakened my strength along the way. He has cut short my days.
19Ps 102:24 I say, "My God, whose years continue through all generations, do not take me in the middle of my life.
19Ps 102:25 You established the earth long ago; the heavens are the work of your hands.
19Ps 102:26 They will perish, but you will remain; and they all will become worn out, like a garment. You will change them like clothing, and they will pass away.
19Ps 102:27 But you remain the same; your years never end.

19Ps 103:11 As high as heaven rises above earth, so his gracious love strengthens those who fear him.
19Ps 103:12 As distant as the east is from the west, that is how far he has removed our sins from us.
19Ps 103:13 As a father has compassion for his children, so the Lord has compassion for those who fear him.
19Ps 103:14 For he knows how we were formed, aware that we were made from dust.
19Ps 103:15 A person's life is like grass?it blossoms like wild flowers,
19Ps 103:16 but when the wind blows through it, it withers away and no one remembers where it was.

19Ps 104:1 Bless the Lord, My soul; Lord, my God, you are very great. You are clothed in splendor and majesty;
19Ps 104:2 you are wrapped in light like a garment, stretching out the sky like a curtain.
19Ps 104:3 He lays the beams of his roof loft on the water above, making clouds his chariot, walking on the wings of the wind.
19Ps 104:4 He makes the winds his messengers, blazing fires his servants.
19Ps 104:5 He established the earth on its foundations,so that it never falters.
19Ps 104:6 You covered the primeval ocean like a garment; the water stood above the mountains.
19Ps 104:7 They flee at your rebuke; they rush away at the sound of your thunders.
19Ps 104:8 Mountains rise up and valleys sink to the place you have ordained for them. 
19Ps 104:9 You have set a boundary they cannot cross; they will never again cover the earth.
19Ps 104:10 He causes springs to gush forth into rivers that flow between the mountains.
19Ps 104:11 They give water for animals of the field to drink; the wild donkeys quench their thirst.
19Ps 104:12 Birds of the sky live beside them and chirp a song among the foliage. 
19Ps 104:13 He waters the mountains from his heavenly rooms; the earth is satisfied from the fruit of your work.
19Ps 104:14 He causes grass to sprout for the cattle and plants for people to cultivate, to produce food from the land, 
19Ps 104:15 like wine that makes the heart of people happy, oil that makes the face glow, and food that sustains people.
19Ps 104:16 The loftiest trees are satisfied, the cedars of Lebanon that he planted,
19Ps 104:17 the birds build their nests there, and the heron builds its nest among the evergreen.
19Ps 104:18 The high mountains are for wild goats; the cliffs are a refuge for the rock badger.
19Ps 104:19 He made the moon to mark time; the sun knows its setting time.
19Ps 104:20 You bring darkness and it becomes night; when every beast of the forest prowls. 
19Ps 104:21 Young lions roar for prey, seeking their food from God.
19Ps 104:22 When the sun rises, they gather and lie down in their dens.
19Ps 104:23 People go out to their work and labor until evening.
19Ps 104:24 How numerous are your works, Lord! You have made them all wisely; the earth is filled with your creations.
19Ps 104:25 There is the deep and wide sea, teeming with numberless creatures, living things small and great.
19Ps 104:26 There, the ships pass through; Leviathan, which you created, frolics in it. 
19Ps 104:27 All of them look to you to provide them their food at the proper time.
19Ps 104:28 They receive what you give them; when you open your hand, they are filled with good things.
19Ps 104:29 When you withdraw your favor, they are disappointed; Take away their breath, and they die and return to dust.
19Ps 104:30 When you send your spirit, they are created, and you replenish the surface of the earth.

19Ps 104:33 I will sing to the Lord with my whole being; I will sing to my God continuously!
19Ps 104:34 May my thoughts be pleasing to him; indeed, I will rejoice in the Lord!
19Ps 104:35 May sinners disappear from the land and the wicked live no longer. Bless the Lord, My soul! Hallelujah!
19Ps 105:1 Give thanks to the Lord, call on his name, and make his deeds known among the people.
19Ps 105:2 Sing to him! Praise him! Declare all his awesome deeds!
19Ps 105:3 Exult in his holy name; let all those who seek the Lord rejoice!
19Ps 105:4 Seek the Lord and his strength; seek his face continuously.
19Ps 105:5 Remember his awesome deeds that he has done, his wonders and the judgments he declared.
19Ps 105:6 You descendants of Abraham, his servant, You children of Jacob, his chosen ones.
19Ps 105:7 He is the Lord our God; his judgments extend to the entire earth. 
19Ps 105:8 He remembers his eternal covenant?every promise he made for a thousand generations,
19Ps 105:9 like the covenant he made with Abraham, and his promise to Isaac.
19Ps 105:10 He presented it to Jacob as a decree, to Israel as an everlasting covenant.
19Ps 105:11 He said£º "I will give Canaan to you as the allotted portion that is your inheritance."
19Ps 105:12 When the Hebrews were few in number?so very few?and were sojourners in it,
19Ps 105:13 they wandered from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another.
19Ps 105:14 He did not allow anyone to oppress them, or any kings to reprove them.
19Ps 105:15 "Don't touch my anointed or hurt my prophets!"
19Ps 105:16 He declared a famine on the land; destroying the entire food supply.
19Ps 105:17 He sent a man before them?Joseph, who had been sold as a slave.
19Ps 105:18 They bound his feet with fetters and placed an iron collar on his neck,
19Ps 105:19 until the time his prediction came true, as the word of the Lord refined him.
19Ps 105:20 He sent a king who released him, a ruler of people who set him free.
19Ps 105:21 He made him the master over his household, the manager of all his possessions?
19Ps 105:22 to discipline his rulers at will and make his elders wise.
19Ps 105:23 Then Israel came to Egypt; indeed, Jacob lived in the land of Ham.
19Ps 105:24 He caused his people to multiply greatly; and be more numerous than their enemies. 
19Ps 105:25 He caused them to hate his people and to deceive his servants. 
19Ps 105:26 He sent his servant Moses, along with Aaron, whom he had chosen.
19Ps 105:27 They performed his signs among them, his wonders in the land of Ham.
19Ps 105:28 He sent darkness, and it became dark. Did they not rebel against his words?
19Ps 105:29 He turned their water into blood, so that the fish died.
19Ps 105:30 Their land swarmed with frogs even to the chambers of their kings.
19Ps 105:31 He spoke, and a swarm of insects invaded their land.
19Ps 105:32 He set hail instead of rain, and lightning throughout their land.
19Ps 105:33 It destroyed their vines and their figs, breaking trees throughout their country.
19Ps 105:34 Then he commanded the locust to come?grasshoppers without number.
19Ps 105:35 They consumed every green plant in their land, and devoured the fruit of their soil.
19Ps 105:36 He struck down every firstborn in their land, the firstfruits of all their progeny.
19Ps 105:37 Then he brought Israel out with silver and gold, and no one among his tribes stumbled. 
19Ps 105:38 The Egyptians rejoiced when they left, because fear of Israel descended on them.
19Ps 105:39 He spread out a cloud for a cover, and fire for light at night. 
19Ps 105:40 Israel asked, and quail came; food from heaven satisfied them.
19Ps 105:41 He opened a rock, and water gushed out flowing like a river in the desert.
19Ps 105:42 Indeed, he remembered his sacred promise to his servant Abraham.
19Ps 105:43 He led his people out with gladness, his chosen ones with shouts of joy.
19Ps 105:44 He gave to them the land of nations; they inherited the labor of other people
19Ps 105:45 so they might keep his statutes and observe his laws. Hallelujah!
19Ps 106:1 Hallelujah! Give thanks to the Lord, since he is good, for his gracious love exists forever.
19Ps 106:2 Who can fully describe the mighty acts of the Lord or proclaim all his praises?
19Ps 106:3 How happy are those who enforce justice, who live righteously all the time.
19Ps 106:4 Remember me, Lord, when you show favor to your people. Visit us with your deliverance,
19Ps 106:5 to witness the prosperity of your chosen ones, to rejoice in your nation's joy, to glory in your inheritance.
19Ps 106:6 We have sinned, along with our ancestors; we have committed iniquity and wickedness.
19Ps 106:7 In Egypt, our ancestors neither comprehended your awesome deeds nor remembered your abundant gracious love. Instead, they rebelled beside the sea, the Reed Sea.
19Ps 106:8 He delivered for the sake of his name, to make his power known.
19Ps 106:9 He shouted at the Reed Sea and it dried up; and led them through the sea as though through a desert.
19Ps 106:10 He delivered them from the power of their foe; redeeming them from the power of their enemy.
19Ps 106:11 The water overwhelmed their enemies, so that not one of them survived.
19Ps 106:12 Then they believed his word and sung his praise. 
19Ps 106:13 But they quickly forgot his deeds and did not wait for his counsel.
19Ps 106:14 They were overwhelmed with craving in the wilderness, so God tested them in the wasteland.
19Ps 106:15 God granted them their request, but sent leanness into their lives.
19Ps 106:16 They were envious of Moses in the camp, and of Aaron, the holy one of the Lord.
19Ps 106:17 The earth opened and swallowed Dathan, closing over Abiram's clan.
19Ps 106:18 Then a fire burned among their company, a flame that set the wicked ablaze.
19Ps 106:19 They fashioned a calf at Horeb and worshipped a carved image.
19Ps 106:20 They exchanged their glory with the image of a grass-eating bull.
19Ps 106:21 They forgot God their Savior, who performed great things in Egypt?
19Ps 106:22 awesome deeds in the land of Ham, astonishing deeds at the Reed Sea.
19Ps 106:23 He would have destroyed them but for Moses, his chosen one, who stood in the breach before him to avert his destructive wrath.
19Ps 106:24 They rejected the desirable land, and they didn't trust his promise.
19Ps 106:25 They murmured in their tents, and didn't listen to the voice of the Lord.
19Ps 106:26 So he swore an oath concerning them?that he would cause them to die in the wilderness,
19Ps 106:27 to cause their children to perish among the nations and be scattered among many lands. 
19Ps 106:28 For they adopted the worship of Baal Peor and ate sacrifices offered to the dead. 
19Ps 106:29 They had provoked anger by their deeds, so that a plague broke out against them.
19Ps 106:30 But Phinehas intervened and prayed so that the plague was restrained. 
19Ps 106:31 And it was credited to him as a righteous act, from generation to generation?to eternity.
19Ps 106:32 They provoked wrath at the waters of Meribah, and Moses suffered on account of them.
19Ps 106:33 For they rebelled against him, so that he spoke thoughtlessly with his lips.
19Ps 106:34 They never destroy the people, as the Lord had commanded them.
19Ps 106:35 Instead, they mingled among the nations and learned their ways.
19Ps 106:36 They worshipped their idols, and this became a trap for them.
19Ps 106:37 They sacrificed their sons and daughters to demons. 
19Ps 106:38 They shed innocent blood?the blood of their sons and daughters?whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan, thereby polluting the land with blood. 
19Ps 106:39 Therefore, they became unclean because of what they did; they have acted like whores by their evil deeds.
19Ps 106:40 The Lord's anger burned against his people, so that he despised his own inheritance.
19Ps 106:41 He turned them over to domination by nations where those who hated them ruled over them.
19Ps 106:42 Their enemies oppressed them, so that they were humiliated by their power.
19Ps 106:43 He delivered them many times, but they demonstrated rebellion by their evil plans; therefore they sunk deep in their sins.
19Ps 106:44 Yet when he saw their distress and heard their cries for help,
19Ps 106:45 he remembered his covenant with them, and so relented according to the greatness of his gracious love.
19Ps 106:46 He caused all their captors to show compassion toward them.
19Ps 106:47 Deliver us, Lord our God, gather us from among the nations so we may praise your holy name and rejoice in praising you.
19Ps 106:48 Blessed are you, Lord God of Israel, from eternity to eternity; Let all the people say, "Amen!" Hallelujah!
19Ps 107:1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good! His gracious love exists forever.
19Ps 107:2 Let those who have been redeemed by the Lord declare it?those whom he redeemed from the power of the enemy,
19Ps 107:3 those whom he gathered from other lands?from the east, west, north, and south.
19Ps 107:4 They wandered in desolate wilderness; they found no road to a city where they could live.
19Ps 107:5 Hungry and thirsty, their spirits failed.
19Ps 107:6 Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them from their distress.
19Ps 107:7 He led them in a straight way to find a city where they could live.
19Ps 107:8 Let them give thanks to the Lord for his gracious love and his awesome deeds for mankind.
19Ps 107:9 He has satisfied the one who thirsts, filling the hungry with what is good.
19Ps 107:10 Some sat in deepest darkness, shackled with cruel iron,
19Ps 107:11 because they had rebelled against the command of God, despising the advice of the Most High. 
19Ps 107:12 He humbled them through suffering, as they stumbled without a helper.
19Ps 107:13 Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble; he delivered them from their distress.
19Ps 107:14 And he brought them out from darkness and the shadow of death, shattering their chains.
19Ps 107:15 Let them give thanks to the Lord for his gracious love, and for his awesome deeds to mankind.
19Ps 107:16 For he shattered bronze gates and cut through iron bars.
19Ps 107:17 Because of their rebellious ways, fools suffered for their iniquities. 
19Ps 107:18 They loathed all food, and even reached the gates of death.
19Ps 107:19 Yet when they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, he delivered them from certain destruction.
19Ps 107:20 He issued his command and healed them; he delivered them from their destruction.
19Ps 107:21 Let them give thanks to the Lord for his gracious love, and for his awesome deeds for mankind.
19Ps 107:22 Let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and talk about his works with shouts of joy.
19Ps 107:23 Those who go down to the sea in ships, who work in the great waters,
19Ps 107:24 witnessed the works of the Lord?his awesome deeds in the ocean's depth.
19Ps 107:25 He spoke and stirred up a windstorm that made its waves surge.
19Ps 107:26 The people ascended skyward and descended to the depths, their courage melting away in their peril.
19Ps 107:27 They reeled and staggered like a drunkard, as all their wisdom became useless.
19Ps 107:28 Yet when they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, the Lord brought them out of their distress.
19Ps 107:29 He calmed the storm and its waves quieted down. 
19Ps 107:30 So they rejoiced that the waves became quiet, and he led them to their desired haven.
19Ps 107:31 Let them give thanks to the Lord for his gracious love and for his awesome deeds on behalf of mankind.
19Ps 107:32 Let them exalt him in the assembly of the people and praise him in the counsel of the elders.
19Ps 107:33 He turns rivers into a desert, springs of water into dry ground,
19Ps 107:34 and a fruitful land into a salty waste, due to the wickedness of its inhabitants.
19Ps 107:35 He turns a desert into a pool of water, dry land into springs of water.
19Ps 107:36 There he settled the hungry, where they built a city to live in.
19Ps 107:37 They sowed fields and planted vineyards that yielded a productive harvest.
19Ps 107:38 Then he blessed them, and they became numerous; he multiplied their cattle.
19Ps 107:39 But they became few in number, and humiliated by continued oppression, agony, and sorrow.
19Ps 107:40 Having poured contempt on their nobles, causing them to err aimlessly in the way.
19Ps 107:41 Yet he lifted the needy from affliction and made them families like a flock.
19Ps 107:42 The upright see it and rejoice, but the mouth of an evil person is shut.
19Ps 107:43 Let whoever is wise observe these things, that they may comprehend the gracious love of the Lord.
19Ps 108:1 My heart is firm, God; I will sing and praise you with my whole being.
19Ps 108:2 Awake, harp and lyre! I will wake up at dawn.
19Ps 108:3 I will give thanks to you among the peoples, Lord! I will sing praise to you among the nations.
19Ps 108:4 For your gracious love extends to the sky, and your faithfulness reaches to the clouds.
19Ps 108:5 May you be exalted above the heavens, God, and your glory be over all the earth.
19Ps 108:6 In order that those you love may be rescued, deliver with your power and answer me!
19Ps 108:7 God had promised in his sanctuary£º "I will triumph and divide Shechem, then I will measure the valley of Succoth!
19Ps 108:8 Gilead and Manasseh belong to me, while Ephraim is my chief stronghold and Judah is my scepter.
19Ps 108:9 Moab is my washbasin; I will fling my shoe on Edom and shout over Philistia."
19Ps 108:10 Who will lead me to the fortified city? Who will lead me as far as Edom? God, you have rejected us, have you not, since you did not march out with our army, God?
19Ps 108:12 Give us help against the enemy, because human help is useless.
19Ps 108:13 I will find strength in God, for he will trample on our foes.
19Ps 109:1 God, whom I praise, do not be silent,
19Ps 109:2 for the mouths of wicked and deceitful people are opened against me; they speak against me with lying tongues.
19Ps 109:3 They surround me with hate-filled words, attacking me for no reason.
19Ps 109:4 Instead of receiving my love, they accuse me, though I continue in prayer.
19Ps 109:5 They devise evil against me instead of good, and hatred in place of my love.
19Ps 109:6 Appoint an evil person over him; may an accuser stand at his right side.
19Ps 109:7 When he is judged, may he be found guilty; may his prayer be regarded as sin.
19Ps 109:8 May his days be few; may another take over his position.
19Ps 109:9 May his children become fatherless, and his wife a widow.
19Ps 109:10 May his children roam around begging, seeking food while driven far from their ruined homes.
19Ps 109:11 May creditors seize all his possessions, and may foreigners loot the property he has acquired.
19Ps 109:12 May no one extend gracious love to him, or show favor to his fatherless children.
19Ps 109:13 May his descendants be eliminated, and their memory be erased from the next generation.
19Ps 109:14 May his ancestors' guilt be remembered in the Lord's presence, and may his mother's guilt not be erased.
19Ps 109:15 May what they have done be continuously in the Lord's presence; and may their memory be excised from the earth.
19Ps 109:16 For he didn't think to extend gracious love; he harassed to death the poor, the needy, and the broken hearted.
19Ps 109:17 He loved to curse?may his curses return upon him! He took no delight in blessing others?so may blessings be far from him.
19Ps 109:18 He wore curses like a garment?may they enter his inner being like water and his bones like oil.
19Ps 109:19 May those curses wrap around him like a garment, or like a belt that one always wears.
19Ps 109:20 May this be the way the Lord repays my accuser, those who speak evil against me.
19Ps 109:21 Now you, Lord my God, defend me for your name's sake; because your gracious love is good, deliver me!
19Ps 109:22 Indeed, I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
19Ps 109:23 I am fading away like a shadow late in the day; I am shaken off like a locust.
19Ps 109:24 My knees give way from fasting, and my skin is lean, deprived of oil.
19Ps 109:25 I have become an object of derision to them?they shake their heads whenever they see me.
19Ps 109:26 Help me, Lord my God! Deliver me in accord with your gracious love!
19Ps 109:27 Then they will realize that your hand is in this?that you, Lord, have accomplished it. 
19Ps 109:28 They will curse, but you will bless. When they attack, they will be humiliated, while your servant rejoices.
19Ps 109:29 May my accusers be clothed with shame and wrapped in their humiliation as with a robe.
19Ps 109:30 I will give many thanks to the Lord with my mouth, praising him publicly,
19Ps 109:31 for he stands at the right hand of the needy one, to deliver him from his accusers.
19Ps 110:1 A declaration from the Lord to my Lord£º "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool."
19Ps 110:2 When the Lord extends your mighty scepter from Zion, rule in the midst of your enemies.
19Ps 110:3 Your soldiers are willing volunteers on your day of battle; in majestic holiness, from the womb, from the dawn, the dew of your youth belongs to you.
19Ps 110:4 The Lord took an oath and will never recant£º "You are a priest forever, after the manner of Melchizedek."
19Ps 110:5 The Lord is at your right hand; he will utterly destroy kings in the time of his wrath.
19Ps 110:6 He will execute judgment against the nations,filling graves with corpses. He will utterly destroy leaders far and wide.
19Ps 110:7 He will drink from a stream on the way, then hold his head high.
19Ps 111:1 Hallelujah! I will give thanks to the Lord with all of my heart in the assembled congregation of the upright.
19Ps 111:2 Great are the acts of the Lord; they are within reach of all who desire them.
19Ps 111:3 Splendid and glorious are his awesome deeds, and his righteousness endures forever.
19Ps 111:4 He is remembered for his awesome deeds; the Lord is gracious and compassionate.
19Ps 111:5 He prepares food for those who fear him; he is ever mindful of his covenant.
19Ps 111:6 He revealed his mighty deeds to his people by giving them a country of their own.
19Ps 111:7 Whatever he does is reliable and just, and all his precepts are trustworthy,
19Ps 111:8 sustained through all eternity, and fashioned in both truth and righteousness.
19Ps 111:9 He sent deliverance to his people; he ordained his covenant to last forever; his name is holy and awesome.
19Ps 111:10 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom; sound understanding belongs to those who practice it. Praise of God endures forever.111
19Ps 112:1 Hallelujah! How happy is the person who fears the Lord, who truly delights in his commandments.
19Ps 112:2 His descendants will be powerful in the land, a generation of the upright who will be blessed.
19Ps 112:3 Wealth and riches are in his house, and his righteousness endures forever.
19Ps 112:4 A light shines in the darkness for the upright, for the one who is gracious, compassionate, and just.
19Ps 112:5 It is good for the person who lends generously, conducting his affairs with fairness.
19Ps 112:6 He will never be shaken; the one who is just will always be remembered.
19Ps 112:7 He need not fear a bad report, for his heart is unshaken, since he trusts in the Lord.
19Ps 112:8 His heart is steadfast, he will not fear. In the end he will look in triumph over his enemy.
19Ps 112:9 He gives generously to the poor; his righteousness endures forever; his horn is exalted in honor.
19Ps 112:10 The wicked person sees this and flies into a rage; his teeth gnash and wear away. The desire of the wicked will amount to nothing.
19Ps 113:1 Hallelujah! Give praise, you servants of the Lord. Praise the name of the Lord!
19Ps 113:2 May the name of the Lord be blessed from now to eternity.
19Ps 113:3 From rising to setting sun, may the name of the Lord be praised.
19Ps 113:4 The Lord is exalted high above all the nations; his glory beyond the heavens.
19Ps 113:5 Who is like the Lord our God, enthroned on high,
19Ps 113:6 yet stooping low to observe the sky and the earth?
19Ps 113:7 He lifts the poor person from the dust, raising the needy from the trash pile
19Ps 113:8 and giving him a seat among nobles?with the nobles of his people.
19Ps 113:9 He makes the barren woman among her household a happy mother of joyful children. Hallelujah!
19Ps 114:1 When Israel came out of Egypt?the household of Jacob from a people of foreign speech?
19Ps 114:2 Judah became his sanctuary and Israel his place of dominion.
19Ps 114:3 The sea saw this and fled, the Jordan River ran backwards,
19Ps 114:4 the mountains skipped like rams, and the hills like lambs.
19Ps 114:5 What happened to you, sea, that you fled? Jordan, that you ran backwards?
19Ps 114:6 Mountains, that you skipped like rams? and you hills, that you skipped like lambs?
19Ps 114:7 Tremble then, earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the presence of the God of Jacob,
19Ps 114:8 who turned the rock into a pool of water, the flinty rock into flowing springs.
19Ps 115:1 Not to us, Lord, not to us, but to your name be given glory on account of your gracious love and faithfulness.
19Ps 115:2 Why should the nations ask "Where now is their God?"
19Ps 115:3 when our God is in the heavens and he does whatever he desires?
19Ps 115:4 Their idols are silver and gold, crafted by human hands.
19Ps 115:5 They have mouths, but cannot speak; they have eyes, but cannot see.
19Ps 115:6 They have ears, but cannot hear; they have noses, but cannot smell;
19Ps 115:7 They have hands, but cannot touch; feet, but cannot walk; they cannot even groan with their throats. 
19Ps 115:8 Those who craft them will become like them, as will all those who trust in them.
19Ps 115:9 Israel, trust in the Lord! He is their helper and shield.

19Ps 115:14 May the Lord add to your numbers?to you and to your descendants.
19Ps 115:15 May you be blessed by the Lord, who made the heavens and the earth.
19Ps 115:16 The highest heavens belong to the Lord, but he gave the earth to human beings.
19Ps 115:17 Neither can the dead praise the Lord, nor those who go down into the silence of death.
19Ps 115:18 But we will bless the Lord from now to eternity. Hallelujah!
19Ps 116:1 I love the Lord because he has heard my prayer for mercy;
19Ps 116:2 for he listens to me whenever I call.
19Ps 116:3 The ropes of death were wound around me and the anguish of Sheol came upon me; I encountered distress and sorrow.
19Ps 116:4 Then I called on the name of the Lord, "Lord, please deliver me!"
19Ps 116:5 The Lord is gracious and righteous; our God is compassionate;
19Ps 116:6 the Lord watches over the innocent; I was brought low, and he delivered me.
19Ps 116:7 Return to your resting place, My soul, for the Lord treated you generously.
19Ps 116:8 Indeed, you delivered my soul from death, my eyes from crying, and my feet from stumbling.
19Ps 116:9 I will walk in the Lord's presence in the lands of the living.
19Ps 116:10 I will continue to believe, even when I say, "I am greatly afflicted"
19Ps 116:11 and speak hastily, "All people are liars!"
19Ps 116:12 What shall I return to the Lord for all his benefits to me?
19Ps 116:13 I will raise my cup of deliverance and invoke the Lord's name.
19Ps 116:14 I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people.
19Ps 116:15 In the sight of the Lord, the death of his faithful ones is valued.
19Ps 116:16 Lord, I am indeed your servant. I am your servant. I am the son of your handmaid. You have released my bonds.
19Ps 116:17 I will bring you a thanksgiving offering and call on the name of the Lord!
19Ps 116:18 I will fulfill my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people,
19Ps 116:19 in the courts of the Lord's house, in your midst, Jerusalem. Hallelujah!
19Ps 117:1 Praise the Lord, all you nations! Exalt him, all you peoples!
19Ps 117:2 For great is his gracious love toward us, and the Lord's faithfulness is eternal. Hallelujah!
19Ps 118:1 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good; his gracious love is eternal.
19Ps 118:2 Let Israel now say, "His gracious love is eternal."
19Ps 118:3 Let the house of Aaron now say, "His gracious love is eternal."
19Ps 118:4 Let those who fear the Lord now say, "His gracious love is eternal."
19Ps 118:5 I called on the Lord in my distress; the Lord answered me openly.
19Ps 118:6 The Lord is with me. I will not be afraid. What can people do to me?
19Ps 118:7 With the Lord beside me as my helper, I will triumph over those who hate me. 
19Ps 118:8 It is better to take shelter in the Lord than to trust in people.
19Ps 118:9 It is better to take shelter in the Lord than to trust in princes.
19Ps 118:10 All the nations surrounded me; but in the name of the Lord I will defeat them.
19Ps 118:11 They surrounded me, they are around me; but in the name of the Lord I will defeat them.
19Ps 118:12 They surrounded me like bees; but they will be extinguished like burning thorns. In the name of the Lord I will defeat them.
19Ps 118:13 Indeed, you oppressed me so much that I nearly fell, but the Lord helped me.
19Ps 118:14 The Lord is my strength and protector, for he has become my deliverer.
19Ps 118:15 There's exultation for deliverance in the tents of the righteous£º "The right hand of the Lord is victorious!
19Ps 118:16 The right hand of the Lord Is exalted! The right hand of the Lord is victorious!"
19Ps 118:17 I will not die, but I will live to recount the deeds of the Lord.
19Ps 118:18 The Lord will discipline me severely, but he won't hand me over to die.
19Ps 118:19 Open for me the righteous gates so I may enter through them to give thanks to the Lord. 
19Ps 118:20 This is the Lord's gate?The righteous will enter through it.
19Ps 118:21 I will praise you because you have answered me and have become my deliverer.
19Ps 118:22 The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
19Ps 118:23 This is from the Lord?it is awesome in our sight.
19Ps 118:24 This is the day that the Lord has made; let's rejoice and be glad in it.
19Ps 118:25 Please Lord, deliver us! Please Lord, hurry and bring success now!
19Ps 118:26 Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Let us bless you from the Lord's house.
19Ps 118:27 The Lord is God?he will be our light! Bind the festival sacrifice with ropes to the horn at the altar.
19Ps 118:28 You are my God, and I will praise you; my God, and I will exalt you.
19Ps 118:29 Give thanks to the Lord, for he is good and his gracious love is eternal.
19Ps 119:1 How blessed are those whose life is blameless, who walk in the Law of the Lord!
19Ps 119:2 How blessed are those who observe his decrees, who seek him with all of their heart,
19Ps 119:3 who practice no evil while they walk in his ways.
19Ps 119:4 You have commanded concerning your precepts, that they be guarded with diligence.

19Ps 132:3 "I will not enter my house, or lie down on my bed,
19Ps 132:4 or let myself go to sleep or even take a nap,
19Ps 132:5 until I locate a place for the Lord, a dwelling place for the Mighty One of Jacob."

19Ps 135:11 Sihon, king of the Amorites, Og, king of Bashan, and every kingdom of Canaan?
19Ps 135:12 and he gave their land as an inheritance, an inheritance to his people Israel.
19Ps 135:13 Your name, Lord, exists forever, and your reputation, Lord, throughout the ages.

19Ps 139:16 Your eyes looked upon my embryo, and everything was recorded in your book. The days scheduled for my formation were inscribed, even though not one of them had come yet.
19Ps 139:17 How deep are your thoughts, God! How great is their number!
19Ps 139:18 Were I to count them, they would number more than the sand. When I awake, I will be with you.

19Ps 141:9 Protect me from the trap laid for me and from the snares of those who practice evil.
19Ps 141:10 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, while I come through.
19Ps 142:1 My voice cries out to the Lord; my voice pleads for mercy to the Lord.
19Ps 142:2 I pour out my complaint to him, telling him all of my troubles.
19Ps 142:3 Though my spirit grows faint within me, you are aware of my path. Wherever I go, they have hidden a trap for me.
19Ps 142:4 I look to my right and observe?no one is concerned about me. There is nowhere I can go for refuge, and no one cares for me.
19Ps 142:5 So I cry to you, Lord, declaring, "You are my refuge, my only possession while I am on this earth."
19Ps 142:6 Pay attention to my cry, for I have been brought very low. Deliver me from my tormentors, for they are far too strong for me.

19Ps 144:3 Lord, what are human beings, that you should care about them, or mortal man, that you should think about him?

19Ps 144:10 to you who gives victory to kings, rescuing his servant David from cruel swords.
19Ps 144:11 Rescue me and deliver me from the control of foreigners, whose mouths speak lies, and whose right hand deceives.
19Ps 144:12 May our sons in their youth be like full-grown plants, and our daughters like pillars destined to decorate a palace.

20Pr 1:1 The proverbs of David's son Solomon, king of Israel.
20Pr 1:2 These proverbs are for gaining wisdom and discipline; for understanding words of insight;
20Pr 1:3 for acquiring the discipline that produces wise behavior, righteousness, justice, and upright living;
20Pr 1:4 for giving prudence to the na?ve, knowledge and discretion to the young.
20Pr 1:5 Let the wise listen and increase their learning; let the person of understanding receive guidance
20Pr 1:6 in understanding proverbs, clever sayings, words of the wise, and their riddles.
20Pr 1:7 The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, but fools despise wisdom and discipline.
20Pr 1:8 My son, listen to your father's instruction, and do not let go of your mother's teaching.
20Pr 1:9 They will be a graceful wreath for your head and a chain for your neck.
20Pr 1:10 My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent.
20Pr 1:11 If they say, "Come with us! Let's lie in wait for blood; let's ambush some innocent person for no reason at all.
20Pr 1:12 Let's swallow them alive like Sheol, and whole like those who go down into the Pit,
20Pr 1:13 We'll find all kinds of valuable wealth, and we'll fill our houses with spoil.
20Pr 1:14 Throw your lot in with us, and all of us will have one purse."
20Pr 1:15 My son, do not go along with them, and keep your feet away from their paths!
20Pr 1:16 For they run toward evil; these enticers shed blood without hesitation.
20Pr 1:17 Look, it is useless to spread a net in full view of all the birds,
20Pr 1:18 but these people lie in wait for their own blood. They ambush only themselves.
20Pr 1:19 Such is the way of all those who seek illicit gain? it takes away the lives of those who possess it.
20Pr 1:20 Wisdom cries out in the street; she raises her voice in the public squares.
20Pr 1:21 She calls out at the busiest part of the noisy streets, and at the entrance to the gates of the city she utters her words£º
20Pr 1:22 "You na?ve ones, how long will you love naivet? And how long will scoffers delight in scoffing or fools hate knowledge?
20Pr 1:23 Return to my correction! Look, I will pour out my spirit on you, and I will make my words known to you.
20Pr 1:24 "Because I called out to you and you refused to respond? I appealed, but no one paid attention?
20Pr 1:25 because you neglected all my advice and did not want my correction,
20Pr 1:26 I will laugh at your calamity. I will mock when what you fear comes,
20Pr 1:27 when what you dread comes like a storm, and your calamity comes on like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you.
20Pr 1:28 Then they will call out to me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently, but they will not find me.
20Pr 1:29 Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord;
20Pr 1:30 they did not want my advice, and they rejected all my correction.
20Pr 1:31 They will eat the fruit of their way, and they will be filled with their own devices.
20Pr 1:32 Indeed, the waywardness of the na?ve will kill them, and the complacency of fools will destroy them.
20Pr 1:33 But the person who listens to me will live safely and will be secure from the fear of evil.
20Pr 2:1 My son, if you accept my words, and treasure my instructions?
20Pr 2:2 making your ear attentive to wisdom, and turning your heart to understanding?
20Pr 2:3 if, indeed, you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding,
20Pr 2:4 if you seek it like silver and search for it like hidden treasure,
20Pr 2:5 then you will understand the fear of the Lord and learn to know God.
20Pr 2:6 For the Lord gives wisdom, and from his mouth come knowledge and understanding.
20Pr 2:7 He stores up sound wisdom for the upright and is a shield to those who walk in integrity?
20Pr 2:8 guarding the paths of the just and protecting the way of his faithful ones.
20Pr 2:9 Then you will understand what is right, just, and upright?every good path.
20Pr 2:10 For wisdom will enter your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul.
20Pr 2:11 Discretion will protect you; understanding will watch over you,
20Pr 2:12 delivering you from the way of evil, from men who speak perverse things,
20Pr 2:13 and from those who abandon the right path to travel along the ways of darkness;
20Pr 2:14 who delight in doing evil, and rejoice in the perverseness of evil;
20Pr 2:15 whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways,
20Pr 2:16 delivering you from the adulteress, from the immoral woman with her seductive words,
20Pr 2:17 someone who abandoned the companion of her youth and forgot the covenant of her God.
20Pr 2:18 For her house leads down to death, and her paths down to the realm of the dead.
20Pr 2:19 None who go to her return, nor do they reach the paths of life.
20Pr 2:20 This is how you will walk in the way of good men and will keep to the paths of the righteous.
20Pr 2:21 For the upright will live in the land, and people of integrity will remain in it.
20Pr 2:23 But the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be uprooted from it.
20Pr 3:1 My son, don't forget my instruction, and keep my commandments carefully in mind.
20Pr 3:2 For they will add length to your days, years to your life, and abundant peace to you.
20Pr 3:3 Do not let gracious love and truth leave you. Bind them around your neck, write them on the tablet of your heart,
20Pr 3:4 and find favor and a good reputation with God and men.
20Pr 3:5 Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not depend on your own understanding.
20Pr 3:6 In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make your paths straight.
20Pr 3:7 Do not be wise in your own opinion. Fear the Lord and turn away from evil.
20Pr 3:8 This will bring healing to your body, and refreshment to your bones. 
20Pr 3:9 Honor the Lord with your wealth and with the first of all your produce.
20Pr 3:10 So your barns will be filled with abundance, and your vats will burst open with new wine.
20Pr 3:11 My son, do not reject the Lord's discipline, and do not despise his correction,
20Pr 3:12 because the Lord corrects the person he loves, just as a father corrects the son he delights in.
20Pr 3:13 How joyful is the man who finds wisdom, and the man who gains understanding,
20Pr 3:14 because her profit is better than the profit of silver, and her yield than fine gold.
20Pr 3:15 She is more precious than rubies, and nothing you desire compares with her.
20Pr 3:16 Long life is in her right hand, and in her left are riches and honor.
20Pr 3:17 Her ways are pleasant ways, and all her paths are peaceful.
20Pr 3:18 She is a tree of life for those who embrace her, and whoever clutches her tightly will be joyful.
20Pr 3:19 By wisdom the Lord laid the earth's foundations, and by understanding he set the heavens in place.
20Pr 3:20 By his knowledge the depths broke open, and the clouds drip with dew.
20Pr 3:21 My son, do not let wisdom leave your sight. Carefully observe sound judgment and discernment,
20Pr 3:22 and they will be life to you and a graceful ornament for your neck.
20Pr 3:23 Then you will travel safely on your way, and your foot will not stumble.
20Pr 3:24 When you sit down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be pleasant.
20Pr 3:25 Do not be afraid of sudden disaster, or the devastation that comes to the wicked.
20Pr 3:26 Indeed, the Lord will be your confidence, and he will keep your foot from being caught.
20Pr 3:27 Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to act.
20Pr 3:28 Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come back. I will pay you tomorrow," when you have cash with you.
20Pr 3:29 Do not plan to harm your neighbor, when he is living peacefully beside you.
20Pr 3:30 Do not bring a lawsuit against a person for no reason, when he has done you no harm.
20Pr 3:31 Do not envy a violent man, and do not emulate his lifestyle.
20Pr 3:32 Indeed, a perverse man is utterly disgusting to the Lord, but he takes the upright into his confidence.
20Pr 3:33 The Lord's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous.
20Pr 3:34 Though God scoffs at scoffers, he gives grace to the humble.
20Pr 3:35 The wise will inherit honor, but he holds fools up for ridicule.
20Pr 4:1 Listen, children, to your father's instruction, and pay attention in order to gain understanding.
20Pr 4:2 I give you sound teaching, so do not abandon my instruction.
20Pr 4:3 When I was a son to my father, not yet strong and an only son to my mother,
20Pr 4:4 he taught me and said to me,"Let your heart fully embrace what I have to say; keep my commandments and live!
20Pr 4:5 "Get wisdom! Get understanding! Do not forget or turn aside from the words of my mouth!
20Pr 4:6 "Do not abandon her, and she will protect you. Love her, and she will watch over you.
20Pr 4:7 "Wisdom is of utmost importance, therefore get wisdom, and with all your effort work to acquire understanding.
20Pr 4:8 "Prize her and she will exalt you. Indeed, if you embrace her, she will honor you.
20Pr 4:9 "She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will present to you a crown of beauty."
20Pr 4:10 Listen, my son£º accept my words, and you'll live a long, long time. 
20Pr 4:11 I have directed you in the way of wisdom, and I have led you along straight paths.
20Pr 4:12 When you walk, your step will not be hindered, and when you run, you will not stumble.
20Pr 4:13 Hold on to instruction, do not let it go! Guard wisdom, because she is your life!
20Pr 4:14 Do not enter the path of the wicked, or go along the way of evil men.
20Pr 4:15 Avoid it! Don't travel on it! Turn away from it, and pass on by.
20Pr 4:16 For they cannot sleep unless they are doing evil, and they are robbed of their sleep unless they cause someone to stumble.
20Pr 4:17 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and they drink the wine of violence.
20Pr 4:18 The path of the righteous is like the light of dawn that grows brighter until the full light of day.
20Pr 4:19 But the way of the wicked is like deep darkness, and they do not know what they are stumbling over.
20Pr 4:20 My son, pay attention to my words, and listen closely to what I say.
20Pr 4:21 Do not let them out of your sight; keep them within your heart.
20Pr 4:22 For they are life to those who find them, and healing to their whole body.
20Pr 4:23 Above everything else guard your heart, because from it flow the springs of life.
20Pr 4:24 Never talk deceptively and don't keep company with people whose speech is corrupt. 
20Pr 4:25 Let your eyes look directly ahead; fix your gaze straight in front of you.
20Pr 4:26 Carefully measure the paths for your feet, and all your ways will be established.
20Pr 4:27 Do not turn to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil.
20Pr 5:1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom, and listen closely to my insight,
20Pr 5:2 so you may carefully practice discretion and your lips preserve knowledge.
20Pr 5:3 For the lips of an adulteress drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil.
20Pr 5:4 But in the end she is as bitter as wormwood, and as sharp as a double-edged sword.
20Pr 5:5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to Sheol.
20Pr 5:6 You aren't thinking about where her life is headed; her steps wander, but you do not realize it.
20Pr 5:7 Now, children, listen to me. Don't turn away from what I am saying.
20Pr 5:8 Keep far away from her, and don't go near the entrance to her house,
20Pr 5:9 so that you don't give your honor to others, and waste your best years,
20Pr 5:10 so that strangers don't enrich themselves at your expense, and your work won't end up the possession of foreigners.
20Pr 5:11 You will cry out in anguish when your end comes when your flesh and body are consumed.
20Pr 5:12 And you will say, "How I hated instruction, and my heart rejected correction.
20Pr 5:13 I did not obey my teachers and did not listen to my instructors.
20Pr 5:14 Now I am at the point of utter disaster in the assembly and in the congregation."
20Pr 5:15 Drink water from your own cistern, and fresh water from your own well.
20Pr 5:16 Should your springs flow outside, or streams of water in the street?
20Pr 5:17 They should be for you alone and not for strangers who are with you.
20Pr 5:18 Let your fountain be blessed and enjoy the wife of your youth.
20Pr 5:19 Like a loving deer, a beautiful doe, let her breasts satisfy you all the time. Be constantly intoxicated by her love. 
20Pr 5:20 Why should you be intoxicated by an adulteress, my son, and embrace the bosom of a foreign woman?
20Pr 5:21 Indeed, what a man does is always in the Lord's presence, and he weighs all his paths.
20Pr 5:22 The wicked person's iniquities will capture him, and he will be held with the cords of his sin.
20Pr 5:23 He will die for lack of discipline, and he goes astray because of his great folly.
20Pr 6:1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor, if you have agreed to a deal with a stranger,
20Pr 6:2 trapped by your own words, and caught by your own words,
20Pr 6:3 then do this, my son and deliver yourself, because you have come under your neighbor's control. Go, humble yourself! Plead passionately with your neighbor!
20Pr 6:4 Don't allow yourself to sleep or even to close your eyes.
20Pr 6:5 Deliver yourself like a gazelle from a hunter's hand, or like a bird from a fowler's hand.
20Pr 6:6 Go to the ant, you lazy man! Observe its ways and become wise.
20Pr 6:7 It has no commander, officer, or ruler
20Pr 6:8 but prepares its provisions in the summer and gathers its food in the harvest.
20Pr 6:9 How long will you lie down, lazy man? When will you get up from your sleep?
20Pr 6:10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest,
20Pr 6:11 and your poverty will come on you like a bandit and your desperation like an armed man.
20Pr 6:12 A worthless man, a wicked man, goes around with devious speech,
20Pr 6:13 winking with his eyes, making signs with his feet, pointing with his fingers,
20Pr 6:14 planning evil with a perverse mind, continually stirring up discord.
20Pr 6:15 Therefore, disaster will overtake him suddenly. He will be broken in an instant, and he will never recover.
20Pr 6:16 Here are six things that the Lord hates? seven, in fact, are detestable to him£º
20Pr 6:17 Arrogant eyes, a lying tongue and hands shedding innocent blood;
20Pr 6:18 a heart crafting evil plans, feet running swiftly to wickedness,
20Pr 6:19 a false witness snorting lies, and someone sowing quarrels between brothers.
20Pr 6:20 Keep your father's commands, my son, and never forsake your mother's rules,
20Pr 6:21 by binding them to your heart continually, fastening them around your neck.
20Pr 6:22 During your travels wisdom will lead you; she will watch over you while you rest; and when you are startled from your sleep she will commune with you.
20Pr 6:23 Because the command is a lamp and the Law a light, rebukes that discipline are a way of life?
20Pr 6:24 to protect you from the evil woman, from the words of the seductive woman.
20Pr 6:25 Do not focus on her beauty in your mind, nor allow her to take you prisoner with her flirting eyes,
20Pr 6:26 because the price of a whore is a loaf of bread, and an adulterous woman stalks a man's precious life.
20Pr 6:27 Can a man scoop fire into his bosom without burning his clothes?
20Pr 6:28 Can a man walk on hot coals without scorching his feet?6
20Pr 6:29 So also is it with someone who has sex with his neighbor's wife; anyone touching her will not remain unpunished.6
20Pr 6:30 A thief isn't despised if he steals to meet his needs when he is hungry,
20Pr 6:31 but when he is discovered, he must restore seven-fold, forfeiting the entire value of his house.
20Pr 6:32 Whoever commits adultery with a woman is out of his mind; by doing so he corrupts his own soul.
20Pr 6:33 He will receive a beating and dishonor, and his shame won't disappear,
20Pr 6:34 because jealousy incites a strong man's rage, and he will show no mercy when it's time for revenge.
20Pr 6:35 He will not consider any payment, nor will he be willing to accept it, no matter how large the bribe.
20Pr 7:1 My son, guard what I say and treasure my commands.
20Pr 7:2 Keep my commands and you'll live. Guard my teaching as you do your eyesight.
20Pr 7:3 Strap them to your fingers, and engrave them on the tablet of your heart.
20Pr 7:4 Say to wisdom, "You're my sister!" and call understanding your close relative,
20Pr 7:5 so they can keep you from an adulterous woman, from the immoral woman with her seductive words.
20Pr 7:6 For from a window in my house I peered through the lattice work,
20Pr 7:7 and I noticed among the na?ve? that is, I discerned among the youths? a senseless young man.
20Pr 7:8 Proceeding down the street near her corner, he makes his way toward her house
20Pr 7:9 at twilight, during the evening, even during the darkest part of the night.
20Pr 7:10 Look! A woman makes her way to meet him, dressed as a prostitute and intending to entrap him.
20Pr 7:11 She is brazen and defiant? her feet don't remain at home.
20Pr 7:12 Now she is in the street, now in the plazas, she lurks near every corner.
20Pr 7:13 So she grabs hold of him and kisses him, with a brazen face she speaks to him,
20Pr 7:14 "I have given my peace offerings, and today I fulfilled my vows.
20Pr 7:15 Therefore I've come out to meet you, I've looked just for you, and I found you!
20Pr 7:16 I've decorated my bed with new coverings? embroidered linen from Egypt.
20Pr 7:17 I've perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
20Pr 7:18 Come, let's make love until dawn; let's comfort ourselves with love,
20Pr 7:19 because my husband isn't home. He left on a long trip.
20Pr 7:20 He took a fist full of cash and he'll return home in a month."
20Pr 7:21 She leads him astray with great persuasion; with flattering lips she seduces him.
20Pr 7:22 All of a sudden he follows her like an ox fit for slaughter or like a fool fit for a trap
20Pr 7:23 until an arrow pierces his liver. As a bird darts into a snare, he doesn't realize his fatal decision.
20Pr 7:24 So listen to me, my sons, and pay attention to what I have to say.
20Pr 7:25 Don't be led astray by her lifestyle, and don't imitate her behavior.
20Pr 7:26 For many are the victims whom she has conquered, and many are her slain.
20Pr 7:27 Her house leads to Sheol, descending to death's catacombs.
20Pr 8:1 Isn't wisdom calling out; isn't understanding raising her voice?
20Pr 8:2 On top of the highest places along the road she stands where the roads meet.
20Pr 8:3 Beside the gates, at the city entrance? at the entrance to the portals she cries aloud£º
20Pr 8:4 "I'm calling to you, men! What I have to say pertains to all mankind!
20Pr 8:5 Understand prudence, you na?ve people; and gain an understanding heart, you foolish ones.
20Pr 8:6 Listen, because I have noble things to say, and what I have to say will reveal what is right.
20Pr 8:7 For my mouth speaks the truth? wickedness is detestable to me.
20Pr 8:8 Everything I have to say is just; there isn't anything corrupt or perverse in my speech.
20Pr 8:9 Everything I say is sensible to someone who understands, and correct to those who have acquired knowledge.
20Pr 8:10 Grab hold of my instruction in lieu of money and knowledge instead of the finest gold,
20Pr 8:11 because wisdom is better than precious gems and nothing you desire can compare to it."
20Pr 8:12 "I, wisdom, am related to prudence. I know how to be discreet.
20Pr 8:13 The fear of the Lord is to hate evil. Pride, arrogance, an evil lifestyle, and perverted speech I despise. 
20Pr 8:14 Counsel belongs to me, along with sound judgment. I am understanding. Power belongs to me.
20Pr 8:15 Kings reign by me, and rulers dispense justice through me.
20Pr 8:16 By me leaders rule, as do noble officials and all who govern justly.
20Pr 8:17 I love those who love me, and those who seek me will find me.
20Pr 8:18 Wealth and honor accompany me, as do enduring wealth and righteousness.
20Pr 8:19 My fruit is better than gold, better than even refined gold, and my benefit surpasses the purest silver.
20Pr 8:20 I walk on the way of righteousness, along paths that are just,
20Pr 8:21 I bequeath wealth to those who love me, and I will fill their treasuries."
20Pr 8:22 "The Lord made me as he began his planning, before his ancient activity commenced.
20Pr 8:23 From eternity I was appointed, from the beginning, from before there was land.
20Pr 8:24 When there were no ocean depths, I brought them to birth at a time when there were no springs.
20Pr 8:25 Before the mountains were shaped, before there were hills, I was bringing them to birth.
20Pr 8:26 Even though he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor the world's first grains of dust,
20Pr 8:27 when he crafted the heavens, I was there? when he marked out a circle on the face of the deep,
20Pr 8:28 when he made the clouds from above, when the springs of the depths were established,
20Pr 8:29 when he set a boundary for the seaso the waters would not exceed his limits, when he marked out the foundations of the earth.
20Pr 8:30 Then I was with him, his master craftsman? I was his delight daily, continuously rejoicing in his presence,
20Pr 8:31 rejoicing in his inhabitable world and taking delight in mankind."
20Pr 8:32 "So listen to me, children! Blessed are those who obey me.
20Pr 8:33 Listen to instruction and be wise. Don't ignore it.
20Pr 8:34 Blessed is the person who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at my doorways?
20Pr 8:35 because those who find me find life and gain favor from the Lord.
20Pr 8:36 But whoever sins against me destroys himself; everyone who hates me loves death."
20Pr 9:1 Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn out her seven pillars.
20Pr 9:2 She has prepared her food, she has spiced her wine, and she also has set her dining table.
20Pr 9:3 She has sent out her young women, while calling out from the heights of the city,
20Pr 9:4 "Let whoever is na?ve, turn in here." To anyone lacking sense, she says,
20Pr 9:5 "Come! Eat my food, and drink the wine that I have mixed.
20Pr 9:6 Leave your na?ve ways, and live. Walk in the path of understanding."
20Pr 9:7 Whoever corrects a mocker invites only insult, and whoever rebukes the wicked will himself become stained.
20Pr 9:8 Don't rebuke a mocker or he will hate you. Rebuke a wise person, and he will love you.
20Pr 9:9 Counsel a wise man, and he will be wiser still; teach a righteous man, and he will add to his learning.
20Pr 9:10 The fear of the Lord is where wisdom begins, and knowing holiness demonstrates understanding.
20Pr 9:11 For because of me you will live a long life, and years will be added to your life.
20Pr 9:12 If you are wise, your wisdom will assist you. If you mock, you alone will be held responsible.
20Pr 9:13 The foolish woman is loud, undisciplined, and without knowledge.
20Pr 9:14 She sits at the entrance of her house, on a seat high above the city.
20Pr 9:15 She calls out to those passing by on the road, who are minding their own business,9
20Pr 9:16 "Whoever is na?ve, turn in here!" And to anyone lacking sense, she says,9
20Pr 9:17 "Stolen waters are sweet, and food eaten in secret is delicious."
20Pr 9:18 But he does not realize that the dead lurk there, and her invited guests wind up in the depths of Sheol.

20Pr 10:16 Honorable wages lead to life; the salaries of the wicked, to retribution.
20Pr 10:17 Whoever heeds correction is on the pathway to life, but someone who ignores exhortation goes astray.
20Pr 10:18 Whoever conceals hatred is a deceitful liar, and whoever spreads slander is a fool.
20Pr 10:19 Transgression is at work where people talk too much, but anyone who holds his tongue is prudent.
20Pr 10:20 What the righteous person says is like precious silver; the thoughts of the wicked are compared to small things.
20Pr 10:21 What the righteous person says nourishes many, but fools die because they lack discerning hearts.
20Pr 10:22 The blessing of the Lord establishes wealth, and difficulty does not accompany it.
20Pr 10:23 Just as the fool considers wickedness his joy, so is wisdom to the discerning man.
20Pr 10:24 What the wicked fears will come about, but the longing of the righteous will be granted.
20Pr 10:25 When the storm ends, the wicked vanish, but the righteous person is forever firm.
20Pr 10:26 As vinegar is to the mouth and smoke to the eyes, so is the lazy person to those who send him.
20Pr 10:27 Fearing the Lord prolongs life, but the wicked will not live long.
20Pr 10:28 What the righteous hope for brings joy, but the expectation of the wicked dies.

20Pr 11:8 The righteous person is delivered from trouble; it comes upon the wicked instead.
20Pr 11:9 By what he says, the godless person can destroy his neighbor, but through knowledge the righteous escape.

20Pr 11:22 Like a gold ring in a pig's snout is a beautiful woman without discretion.
20Pr 11:23 The desire of the righteous is to seek good, but the hope of the wicked results in wrath.
20Pr 11:24 Those who give freely gain even more; others hold back what they owe, becoming even poorer.
20Pr 11:25 A generous person will prosper, and anyone who gives water will receive a flood in return.

20Pr 30:5 Everything God says is pure; he is a shield for those who take refuge in him.
20Pr 30:6 Don't add to his words, or he will rebuke you, and you will be shown to be a liar.
20Pr 30:7 God, I have asked you for two things? don't refuse me before I die?
20Pr 30:8 Keep deception and lies far away from me, and give me neither poverty nor wealth. Feed me with food that I need for today,
20Pr 30:9 so that I don't become overfed and deny you by saying, "Who is the Lord?" or so that I don't become poor and steal, and then misuse the name of my God.
20Pr 30:10 Don't lie about a servant to his master, or that servant will curse you and you will pay for it.
20Pr 30:11 Some people curse their fathers and won't bless their mothers.
20Pr 30:12 Some people view themselves as pure, but haven't been cleansed from their own filth.
20Pr 30:13 Some people?what an arrogant look they have!? raise their eyebrows haughtily.
20Pr 30:14 Some people have swords for teeth and knives for fangs to devour the afflicted from the earth and the needy from among mankind.
20Pr 30:15 The leech has two daughters£º "Give" and "Give". Three things will never be satisfied; four will never say "Enough"?
20Pr 30:16 The afterlife, the barren womb, earth that still demands water, and fire? they never say, "Enough".
20Pr 30:17 The eye that mocks a father and looks with a disobedient attitude at a mother? the valley ravens will pluck it out; and vultures will eat it.
20Pr 30:18 Three things cause wonder for me; four are beyond my understanding£º
20Pr 30:19 The way an eagle flies in the sky, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a young woman.
20Pr 30:20 This is what an immoral woman is like£º she eats, wipes her mouth, then says "I've done nothing wrong."
20Pr 30:21 Under three things the earth trembles, under four it cannot remain steady£º
20Pr 30:22 Under a slave when he becomes a king, a fool when he is overfed,
20Pr 30:23 an unloved woman when she finds a husband, and a servant girl who inherits from her mistress.
20Pr 30:24 Four things on earth are small, but they are very, very wise£º
20Pr 30:25 Ants aren't a strong species, yet they prepare their food in the summer.
20Pr 30:26 The rock badgers aren't a strong species either, yet they build their dens in the rocks.
20Pr 30:27 Locusts have no king, but they all swarm in ranks.
20Pr 30:28 Spiders can be caught by the hand, yet they're found in kings' palaces.
20Pr 30:29 Three things are stately in procession, four which are stately in their gait£º
20Pr 30:30 The lion, mighty among the beasts, retreats before nothing.
20Pr 30:31 The strutting rooster, as well as the goat, and a king with his army.
20Pr 30:32 If you've foolishly exalted yourself or if you've plotted evil, put your hand over your mouth.
20Pr 30:33 Just as whipping milk produces butter, and twisting the nose causes bleeding, so also stirring up anger produces contention.
20Pr 31:1 The words of King Lemuel? a pronouncement with which his mother encouraged him. 
20Pr 31:2 No, my son! No, my son whom I conceived! No, my son to whom I gave birth!
20Pr 31:3 Never devote all your energy to sex, or dedicate your life to destroying kings.
20Pr 31:4 It is not for kings, Lemuel? Not for kings to drink wine or for rulers to desire liquor.
20Pr 31:5 Otherwise, they may drink and forget what has been ordained, perverting justice for all the oppressed.
20Pr 31:6 Give liquor to someone who is perishing, and wine to someone who is deeply depressed.
20Pr 31:7 Let him drink, forget his poverty, and remember his troubles no more.
20Pr 31:8 Speak for those who cannot speak; seek justice for all those on the verge of destruction.
20Pr 31:9 Speak up, judge righteously, and defend the rights of the afflicted and oppressed.
20Pr 31:10 Who can find a capable wife? Her value far exceeds the finest jewels.
20Pr 31:11 Her husband has full confidence in her; as a result, he lacks nothing of value.
20Pr 31:12 She will bring good to him?never evil? every day of her life.
20Pr 31:13 She seeks out wool and flax, working with eager hands.
20Pr 31:14 She is like a seagoing ship that brings her food from far away.
20Pr 31:15 She rises while it is still night, preparing meals for her family and providing for her women servants.
20Pr 31:16 She evaluates a field and purchases it; from the proceeds she plants a vineyard.
20Pr 31:17 She clothes herself with fortitude, and fortifies her arms with strength.
20Pr 31:18 She is confident that her profits are sufficient. Her lamp does not go out at night.
20Pr 31:19 She works with her own hands on her clothes? her hands work the sewing spindle.
20Pr 31:20 She reaches out to the poor, opening her hands to those in need.
20Pr 31:21 She is unafraid of winter's effect on her household, because all of them are warmly clothed.
20Pr 31:22 She creates her own bedding, using fine linen and violet cloth.
20Pr 31:23 Her husband is well known; he sits among the leaders of the land.
20Pr 31:24 She designs and sells linen garments, supplying accessories to clothiers.
20Pr 31:25 Strength and dignity are her garments; she smiles about the future.
20Pr 31:26 She speaks wisely, teaching with gracious love.
20Pr 31:27 She looks discretely to the affairs of her household, and she is never lazy.
20Pr 31:28 Her children stand up and encourage her, as does her husband, who praises her£º
20Pr 31:29 "Many women have done wonderful things," he says, "but you surpass all of them!"
20Pr 31:30 Charm is deceitful and beauty fades; but a woman who fears the Lord shall be praised.
20Pr 31:31 Reward her for her work? let her actions result in public praise.

21Ec 1:1 The words of the Teacher, the son of David, king in Jerusalem.
21Ec 1:2 "Utterly pointless," says the Teacher. "Absolutely pointless; everything is pointless."
21Ec 1:3 What does a man gain from all of the work that he undertakes on earth?
21Ec 1:4 A generation goes, a generation comes, but the earth remains forever.
21Ec 1:5 The sun rises, the sun sets, then rushes back to where it arose.
21Ec 1:6 The wind continuously blows southward, then northward, constantly circulating; and the wind comes back again in its courses.
21Ec 1:7 All the rivers flow toward the sea, but the sea is never full; then rivers return to the headwaters where they began.
21Ec 1:8 Everything is wearisome, more than man is able to express. The eye is never satisfied by seeing, nor the ear by hearing.
21Ec 1:9 Whatever has happened, will happen again; whatever has been done, will be done again. There is nothing new on earth.
21Ec 1:10 Does anything exist about which someone might say, "Look at this! Is this new?" It happened ages ago; it existed before we did.
21Ec 1:11 No one remembers those in the past, nor will they be remembered by those who come after them.
21Ec 1:12 I , the Teacher, have been king over Israel in Jerusalem.
21Ec 1:13 I dedicated myself to using wisdom for study and discovery of everything that is done under heaven. God uses terrible things so human beings will struggle with life.
21Ec 1:14 I observed every activity done on earth. My conclusion£º all of it is pointless? like chasing after the wind.
21Ec 1:15 What is crooked cannot be made straight;1 what is not there cannot be counted.
21Ec 1:16 I told myself, "I have become greater and wiser than anyone who ruled before me in Jerusalem?yes, I have acquired a great deal of wisdom and knowledge."
21Ec 1:17 So I dedicated myself to learn about wisdom and knowledge, and about insanity and foolishness. And I discovered that this is also like chasing after the wind.
21Ec 1:18 For with much wisdom there is much sorrow; the more someone adds to knowledge, the more someone adds to grief.
21Ec 2:1 I told myself, "I will test you with pleasure, so enjoy yourself." But this was pointless.
21Ec 2:2 "Senseless," said I concerning laughter and pleasure, "How practical is this?"
21Ec 2:3 I decided to indulge in wine, while still remaining committed to wisdom. I also tried to indulge in foolishness, just enough to determine whether it was good for human beings under heaven given the short time of their lives.
21Ec 2:4 With respect to my extravagant works, I built houses for myself; I planted vineyards for myself.
21Ec 2:5 I constructed gardens and orchards for myself, and within them I planted all kinds of fruit trees.
21Ec 2:6 I built for myself water reservoirs to irrigate forests that produce trees.
21Ec 2:7 I acquired male and female slaves, and had other slaves born in my house. I also acquired for myself increasing numbers of herds and flocks?more than anyone who had lived before me in Jerusalem.
21Ec 2:8 I also accumulated silver, gold, and the wealth of kings and their kingdoms. I gathered around me both male and female singers, along with what delights a man?all sorts of mistresses. 
21Ec 2:9 So I became great, greater than anyone who had lived before me in Jerusalem. Throughout all of this, I remained wise.
21Ec 2:10 Whenever I wanted something I had seen, I never refused that desire. Instead, I enjoyed everything I did, and this became the reward in what I had undertaken.
21Ec 2:11 Then I examined all of my accomplishments that I had brought about by my own efforts, including the work that I had labored so hard to complete?and it was all pointless, like chasing after the wind, and there was nothing to be gained on earth.
21Ec 2:12 Next I turned to examine wisdom, insanity, and foolishness, because what can a person do who succeeds the king except what has already been accomplished?
21Ec 2:13 I concluded that wisdom is more useful than foolishness, just as light is more useful than darkness.
21Ec 2:14 The wise use their eyes, but the fool walks in darkness. Yet I also know that the same outcome will overtake them all.
21Ec 2:15 Then I told myself, "Whatever happens to the fool will happen also to me. So what's the point in being wise?" And I told myself that this also is pointless.
21Ec 2:16 For neither the wise nor the fool will be long remembered, since in days to come everything will be forgotten. The wise man dies the same way as the fool, does he not?
21Ec 2:17 So I hated life, because whatever is done on earth causes me trouble?it's all pointless, like chasing after the wind.
21Ec 2:18 Then I despised everything I had worked for on earth, that is, the things that I will leave to the person who will succeed me.
21Ec 2:19 And who knows whether he will be wise or foolish? Either way, he will take possession of everything that I have done on earth, especially where I have excelled. This also is pointless.
21Ec 2:20 So I came to be in despair about everything I had accomplished on earth.
21Ec 2:21 For sometimes people who strive to obtain wisdom, knowledge, and equity leave everything as an inheritance to a person who never worked for it. This, too, is pointless and greatly troublesome.
21Ec 2:22 For what does a person gain from everything that he accomplishes and from his inner life struggles that he undergoes while working on earth?
21Ec 2:23 Indeed, all of his days are filled with sorrow, and his struggles bring grief. In fact, his mind remains restless throughout the night. This is pointless, too!
21Ec 2:24 The only worthwhile thing for a human being is to eat, drink, and enjoy life's goodness that he finds in what he accomplishes. This, I observed, is also from the hand of God himself,
21Ec 2:25 for who can eat or enjoy life apart from him?
21Ec 2:26 After all, to the person who is good in God's sight, he gives wisdom, knowledge, and joy, but to the sinner he gives the troublesome task of accumulating and acquiring in order to leave it to someone who is good in the sight of God. This also is pointless and chasing after the wind.
21Ec 3:1 There is a season for everything, and a time for every event under heaven£º
21Ec 3:2 a time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a time to uproot what was planted;
21Ec 3:3 a time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to tear down, and a time to build up;
21Ec 3:4 a time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a time to dance;
21Ec 3:5 a time to scatter stones, and a time to gather stones; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from embracing;
21Ec 3:6 a time to search, and a time to give up searching; a time to keep, and a time to discard;
21Ec 3:7 a time to tear, and a time to mend; a time to be silent, and a time to speak;
21Ec 3:8 a time to love, and a time to hate; a time for war, and a time for peace.
21Ec 3:9 What benefit does the worker gain from what he undertakes?
21Ec 3:10 I have observed the burdens placed by God on human beings in order to perfect them.
21Ec 3:11 He made everything appropriate in its time. He also placed eternity within them?yet, no person can fully comprehend what God is doing from beginning to end.
21Ec 3:12 I have concluded that the only worthwhile thing for them is to take pleasure in doing good in life;
21Ec 3:13 moreover, every person should eat, drink, and enjoy the benefits of everything that he undertakes, since it is a gift from God.
21Ec 3:14 I have concluded that everything that God undertakes will last for eternity?nothing can be added to it nor taken away from it?and that God acts this way so that people will fear him.
21Ec 3:15 That which was, now is; and that which will be, already is; and God examines what has already taken place.
21Ec 3:16 I also examined on earth£º where justice was supposed to exist, there was lawlessness; and where righteousness was supposed to exist, there was lawlessness.
21Ec 3:17 I told myself, "God will judge both the righteous and the wicked, because there is a time set to judge every event and every work."
21Ec 3:18 "As for human beings," I told myself, "God puts them to the test, that they might see themselves as mere animals."
21Ec 3:19 For what happens to people also happens to animals?a single event happens to them£º just as someone dies, so does the other. In fact, they all breathe the same way, so that a human being has no superiority over an animal. All of this is pointless.
21Ec 3:20 All of them go to one place£º all of them originate from dust, and all of them return to dust.
21Ec 3:21 Who knows whether the spirit of human beings ascends, and whether the spirit of animals descends to the earth?
21Ec 3:22 I concluded that it is worthwhile for people to find joy in their accomplishments, because that is their inheritance, since who can see what will exist after him?
21Ec 4:1 Next I turned to consider all kinds of oppression that exists on earth. Look at the tears of the oppressed? there is no one to comfort them. Power is on the side of their oppressors; so they have no comforters.
21Ec 4:2 So I commended the dead who had already died as being happier than the living who are still alive.
21Ec 4:3 Better than both of them is someone who has not yet been born, because he hasn't experienced evil on earth.
21Ec 4:4 Then I examined all sorts of work, including all kinds of excellent achievements that create envy in others. This also is pointless and chasing after the wind.
21Ec 4:5 The fool crosses his arms and starves himself.
21Ec 4:6 It's better to have one handful of tranquility than to have two handfuls of trouble and to chase after the wind.4
21Ec 4:7 Then I turned to re-examine something else that is pointless on earth£º
21Ec 4:8 Consider someone who is alone, having neither son nor brother. There is no end to all of his work, and he is never satisfied with wealth. "So for whom do I work," he asks, "and deprive myself of pleasure?" This, too, is pointless and a terrible tragedy.
21Ec 4:9 Two are better than one, because they have a good return for their labor.
21Ec 4:10 If they stumble, the first will lift up his friend?but woe to anyone who is alone when he falls and there is no one to help him get up.
21Ec 4:11 Again, if two lie close together, they will keep warm, but how can only one stay warm?
21Ec 4:12 If someone attacks one of them, the two of them together will resist. Furthermore, the tri-braided cord is not soon broken.
21Ec 4:13 A poor but wise youth is better than an old but foolish king who will no longer accept correction.
21Ec 4:14 The former can come out of prison to reign, while the latter, even if born to kingship, may become poor.
21Ec 4:15 I observed everyone who lives and walks on earth, along with the youth who will take the king's place.
21Ec 4:16 There was no end to all of his subjects or to all of the people who had come before them. But those who come along afterward will not be happy with him. This is also pointless and a chasing after wind.4
21Ec 5:1 Watch your step whenever you visit God's house, and come more ready to listen than to offer a fool's sacrifice, since fools never think they're doing evil. 
21Ec 5:2 Don't be impulsive with your mouth nor be in a hurry to talk in God's presence. Since God is in heaven and you're on earth, keep your speech short.
21Ec 5:3 Too many worries lead to nightmares, and a fool is known from talking too much.
21Ec 5:4 When you make a promise to God, don't fail to keep it, since he isn't pleased with fools. Make good on your promise.
21Ec 5:5 It's better that you don't promise than that you do promise and not follow through.
21Ec 5:6 Never let your mouth cause you to sin and don't proclaim in the presence of the angel, "My promise was a mistake," for why should God be angry at your excuse and destroy what you've undertaken?
21Ec 5:7 In spite of many daydreams, pointless actions, and empty words, it is God whom you must fear.
21Ec 5:8 Don't be surprised when you see the poor oppressed and the violent perverting both justice and verdicts in a province, for one high official watches another, and there are ones higher still over them.
21Ec 5:9 Also, the increase of the land belongs to everyone; the king himself is served by his field.
21Ec 5:10 Whoever loves money will never have enough money. Whoever loves luxury will not be content with abundance. This also is pointless.
21Ec 5:11 When possessions increase, so does the number of consumers. So what good are they to their owners, except to look at them?
21Ec 5:12 Sweet is the sleep of a working man, whether he eats a little or a lot, but the excess wealth of the rich will not allow him to rest.
21Ec 5:13 I have observed a painful tragedy on earth£º Wealth hoarded by its owner harms him,
21Ec 5:14 and that wealth is lost in troubled circumstances. Then a son is born, but there is nothing left for him.
21Ec 5:15 Just as he came naked from his mother's womb, he will leave as naked as he came; he will receive no profit from his efforts? he cannot carry away even a handful.
21Ec 5:16 This is also a painful tragedy£º However a person comes, he also departs; so what does he gain as he labors after the wind?
21Ec 5:17 Furthermore, all his days he lives in darkness with great sorrow, anger, and affliction.
21Ec 5:18 Look! I observed that it is good and prudent to eat, drink, and enjoy all that is good of a person's work that he does on earth during the limited days of his life, which God gives him, for this is his allotment.
21Ec 5:19 Furthermore, every person to whom God has given wealth, riches, and the ability to enjoy them, to accept this allotment, and to rejoice in his work?this is a gift from God.
21Ec 5:20 For he will not brood much over the days of his life, since God will keep him occupied with the joys of his heart.
21Ec 6:1 There exists another misfortune that I have observed on earth, and it is a heavy burden upon human beings£º
21Ec 6:2 a man to whom God gives wealth, riches, and honor, so that he lacks none of his heart's desires?but God does not give him the capability to enjoy them. Instead, a stranger consumes them. This is pointless and a grievous affliction.
21Ec 6:3 A man might father a hundred children, and live for many years, so that the length of his life is long?but if his life does not overflow with goodness, and he doesn't receive a proper burial, I maintain that a stillborn child is better off than he is,
21Ec 6:4 because the stillborn arrives pointlessly, leaves this earth from darkness, and is buried in an unmarked grave.
21Ec 6:5 Furthermore, though he never saw the sun nor learned anything, he is more content than the other.
21Ec 6:6 Even if he lives a thousand years twice over without experiencing the best?aren't all of them going to the same place?65
21Ec 6:7 Every person works for his own self-interests, but his desires remain unsatisfied.
21Ec 6:8 For what advantage has the wise person over the fool? What advantage does the poor man have in knowing how to face life?
21Ec 6:9 It is better to focus on what you can see than to meander after your self-interest; this also is pointless and a chasing after wind.
21Ec 6:10 Whatever exists has been named already; people know what it means to be human? and one person cannot defeat what is more powerful than he.
21Ec 6:11 Because many words lead to pointlessness, how do people benefit from this?
21Ec 6:12 Who knows what is best for people in this life, every day of their pointless lives that they pass through like a shadow? Who informs people on earth what will come along after them?
21Ec 7:1 A good name exceeds the value of fine perfume, and the day of someone's death exceeds the value of the day of his birth.
21Ec 7:2 It's better to attend a funeral than to attend a banquet, for everyone dies eventually, and the living will take this to heart.
21Ec 7:3 Sorrow is better than laughter, because the heart is made better through trouble.
21Ec 7:4 For the wise person thinks carefully when in mourning, but fools focus their thoughts on pleasure.
21Ec 7:5 It is better to listen to a wise person's rebuke than to listen to the praise of fools.
21Ec 7:6 For as thorns burn to heat a pot, so also is the laughter of the fool? even this is pointless.
21Ec 7:7 Unjust gain makes the wise foolish, and a bribe corrupts the heart.
21Ec 7:8 The conclusion of something is better than its beginning, and a patient attitude is more valuable than a proud one.
21Ec 7:9 Never be in a hurry to become internally angry, since anger settles down in the lap of fools.
21Ec 7:10 Never ask "Why does the past seem so much better than now?" because this question does not come from wisdom.
21Ec 7:11 Wise use of possessions is good; it brings benefit to the living.
21Ec 7:12 Indeed, wisdom gives protection, just like money does, but it's better to know that wisdom gives life, to those who have mastered it.
21Ec 7:13 Consider the work of God£º Who is able to straighten what he has bent?
21Ec 7:14 When times are good, be joyful, when times are bad, consider this£º God made the one as well as the other, so people won't seek anything outside of his best.
21Ec 7:15 I have seen it all during my pointless life£º both a righteous person who dies while he is righteous, and a wicked person who lives to an old age, while remaining wicked.
21Ec 7:16 Do not be overly righteous, nor be overly wise. Why be self-destructive?
21Ec 7:17 Do not excel at wickedness, nor be a fool. Why die before your time?
21Ec 7:18 It is good for you to grab hold of this and not let go, because whoever fears God will escape all of these extremes.
21Ec 7:19 Wisdom given as strength to a wise person is better than having ten powerful men in the city.
21Ec 7:20 For there is not a single righteous man on earth who practices good and does not sin.
21Ec 7:21 Don't listen to everything that is spoken? you may hear your servant cursing you,
21Ec 7:22 since you also know how often you have cursed others.
21Ec 7:23 I used my wisdom to test all of this. I said, "I want to be wise," but it was beyond me.
21Ec 7:24 Whatever it is, it's far off and most profound. Who can attain it?
21Ec 7:25 I committed myself to understand, to learn, to search for wisdom and explanations, and to understand both the evil of foolishness and the stupidity of foolishness.
21Ec 7:26 I discovered for myself a bitterness that surpasses that of death£º the woman whose heart is full of snares and nets, whose hands are chains of bondage. Whoever pleases God will escape from her, but the transgressor will be trapped by her.
21Ec 7:27 "Look at this," says the Teacher. "Linking one thing to another, I reached this conclusion£º
21Ec 7:28 Among the things I seek but have not found£º one man among a thousand I did find, but I have not found one woman to be wise among all these.
21Ec 7:29 I have discovered only this£º God made human beings for righteousness, but they seek many alternatives."
21Ec 8:1 Who is really wise? Who knows how to interpret this saying£º "A person's wisdom improves his appearance, softening a harsh countenance."
21Ec 8:2 I advise doing what the king says, especially regarding an oath to God.
21Ec 8:3 Don't be in a hurry to leave him, and don't persist in evil, for he does whatever he pleases.
21Ec 8:4 Since a king's command is powerful, who is able to challenge him, asking, "What are you doing?"3
21Ec 8:5 Whoever obeys his commands will not experience harm, and the wise in heart will discern both the appropriate time and response.
21Ec 8:6 Indeed, there is a appropriate time and response for every circumstance, since human misery weighs heavily upon him.
21Ec 8:7 For he has absolutely no knowledge what will happen, since who can declare to him when it will come about?
21Ec 8:8 Just as no human being has control over the wind to restrain it, so also no human being has control over the day of his death. Just as no one is discharged during war, so wickedness will not release those who practice it.
21Ec 8:9 I observed all this, and carefully considered everything that is undertaken on earth, especially the time when someone dominates another to his detriment.
21Ec 8:10 So I watched the wicked being entombed. They used to come in and out of the holy place, but now they are forgotten in the city, where they used to work. This, too, is pointless.
21Ec 8:11 Whenever a sentence for a crime is not carried out swiftly, the human mind becomes determined to commit evil.
21Ec 8:12 Even though a sinner does what is wrong a hundred times and still survives, nevertheless I also know that things will go well for those who fear God, who fear in his presence.
21Ec 8:13 But things will not go well for the wicked person£º he will not lengthen his life like a shadow, since he has no fear before God.
21Ec 8:14 Here is a pointless thing that happens on earth£º A righteous man receives what happens to the wicked, and a wicked man receives what happens to the righteous. I concluded that this, too, is pointless.
21Ec 8:15 So then I recommended enjoyment of life, because it is better on earth for a man to eat, drink, and be happy, since this will stay with him throughout his struggle all the days of his life, which God grants him on earth.814
21Ec 8:16 When I dedicated myself to experience wisdom and to observe what is undertaken on earth?even going without sleep day and night?
21Ec 8:17 I saw all of it as the activity of God. Frankly, a human being cannot understand what happens on earth, because however hard a man works to discover it, he will not find out. Despite what he thinks he knows, he will not be able to figure it out.
21Ec 9:1 In light of all of this, I committed myself to explain it this way£º the righteous and the wise, along with everything they do, are in the hands of God. Furthermore, as to love and hate, no human being knows everything concerning them.
21Ec 9:2 Everyone shares the same experience£º a single event affects the righteous, the wicked, the good, the clean, the unclean, whoever sacrifices, and whoever does not sacrifice. As it is with the good person, so also it is with the sinner; as it is with someone who takes an oath, so also it is with someone who fears taking an oath.
21Ec 9:3 There is a tragedy that infects everything that happens on earth£º a common event happens to everyone. In fact, the hearts of human beings are full of evil. Madness remains in their hearts while they live, and afterwards they join the dead.
21Ec 9:4 "While someone is among the living, hope remains," because "it is better to be a living dog than to be a dead lion."
21Ec 9:5 At least the living know they will die, but the dead know nothing; they no longer have a reward, since memory about them has been forgotten.
21Ec 9:6 Furthermore, their love, their hate, and their envy have been long lost. Never again will they have a part in what happens on earth.
21Ec 9:7 Go ahead and enjoy your meals as you eat. Drink your wine with a joyful attitude, because God already has approved your actions.
21Ec 9:8 Always keep your garments white, and don't fail to anoint your head.
21Ec 9:9 Find joy in living with your wife whom you love every day of your pointless life that God gave you on earth, because this is your life assignment and your work to do on earth.
21Ec 9:10 Whatever the activity in which you engage, do it with all your ability, because there is no work, no planning, no learning, and no wisdom in the next world where you're going.
21Ec 9:11 I considered and observed on earth the following£º The race doesn't go to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, nor food to the wise, nor wealth to the smart, nor recognition to the skilled. Instead, timing and circumstances meet them all.
21Ec 9:12 In addition, no human being knows his time£º Like fish captured in a cruel net, or as birds caught in a snare, so also are human beings caught by bad timing that surprises them.
21Ec 9:13 I also observed this example of wisdom on earth, and it seemed important to me£º
21Ec 9:14 There was a little city with few men in it. A great king came against it, surrounded it, and built massive siege ramps against it.
21Ec 9:15 Now there was found within it a poor, but wise man. He delivered the city by his wisdom, but not one person remembered that poor man.14
21Ec 9:16 So I concluded, "Wisdom is better than strength. Nevertheless, the wisdom of the poor is rejected?his words are never heard."
21Ec 9:17 The softly spoken words of the wise are to be heard rather than the shouts of a ruler of fools.
21Ec 9:18 Wisdom is better than weapons of war, and a single sinner can destroy a lot of good.9
21Ec 10:1 As dead flies cause the perfumer's ointment to stink,; so also does a little foolishness to one's reputation of wisdom and honor.
21Ec 10:2 A wise man's heart tends toward his right, but a fool's heart tends toward his left.
21Ec 10:3 Furthermore, the way a fool lives shows he has no sense; he proclaims to everyone that he's a fool.
21Ec 10:4 If your overseer gets angry at you, don't resign, because calmness pacifies great offenses.
21Ec 10:5 Here's another tragedy that I've observed on earth, a kind of error that comes from an overseer£º
21Ec 10:6 Foolishness is given great honor, while the prosperous sit in lowly places.
21Ec 10:7 And I have observed servants riding on horses, while princes walk on the ground like servants.
21Ec 10:8 Whoever digs a pit may fall into it, and whoever breaks through a wall may suffer a snake bite.
21Ec 10:9 Someone who quarries stone might be injured; someone splitting logs can fall into danger.
21Ec 10:10 If someone's ax is blunt?the edge isn't sharpened? then more strength will be needed. Putting wisdom to work will bring success.
21Ec 10:11 If a serpent strikes despite being charmed, there's no point in being a snake charmer.
21Ec 10:12 The words spoken by the wise are gracious, but the lips of a fool will devour him.
21Ec 10:13 He begins his speech with foolishness, and concludes it with evil madness.
21Ec 10:14 The fool overflows with words, and no one can predict what will happen. As to what will happen after him, who can explain it?
21Ec 10:15 The work of a fool so wears him out that he can't even find his way to town.
21Ec 10:16 Woe to the land whose king is a youth and whose princes feast in the morning.
21Ec 10:17 That land is blessed whose king is of noble birth, whose princes feast at the right time, for strength, and not to become drunk.
21Ec 10:18 Through slothfulness the roof deteriorates, and a house leaks because of idleness.
21Ec 10:19 Feasts are for laughter, wine makes life pleasant, and money speaks to everything.
21Ec 10:20 Do not curse the king, even in your thoughts. Do not curse the rich, even in your bedroom. For a bird will fly by and tell what you say, or something with wings may talk about it.
21Ec 11:1 Spread your bread on the water? after a while you will find it.
21Ec 11:2 Apportion what you have into seven, or even eight parts, because you don't know what disaster might befall the land.
21Ec 11:3 If the clouds are full of rain, they will pour out on the earth; if a tree falls toward the south or the north, wherever it falls, there it will lay.
21Ec 11:4 Whoever keeps staring at the wind won't sow; whoever daydreams won't reap.
21Ec 11:5 Just as you do not understand the way of the spirit in the womb of a pregnant mother, so also you do not know what God is doing in everything he makes.11
21Ec 11:6 In the morning, sow your seed and don't stop working until evening, since you don't know which of your endeavors will do well, whether this one or that, or even if both will do equally well.
21Ec 11:7 How sweet is the daylight, and how pleasant it is for someone's eyes to behold the sunshine!
21Ec 11:8 Even if a person lives many years, let him enjoy them all, recalling that there will be many days of darkness to come?all of which are pointless.
21Ec 11:9 So enjoy yourself in your youth, young man, and be encouraged during your younger days. Live as you like, consistent with your world view, but keep in mind that God will bring you to account for everything.
21Ec 11:10 Banish sorrow from your heart, and evil from your body, since both childhood and the prime of life are pointless.
21Ec 12:1 So remember your Creator during your youth! Otherwise, troublesome days will come and years will creep up on you when you'll say, "I find no pleasure in them,"
21Ec 12:2 Otherwise, when the sun, daylight, moon, or stars turn dark, or when clouds fail to return after the rain?
21Ec 12:3 when that day comes, the palace guards will tremble, strong men will stoop down, women grinders will cease because they are few, and the sight of those who peer through the lattice grows dim.
21Ec 12:4 The doors to the street will be shut when the sound of grinding decreases, when one wakes up at the song of a bird, and all of the singing women are silenced.
21Ec 12:5 At that time they will fear climbing heights and dangers along the road while the almond tree will blossom, and the grasshopper is weighed down. Desire will cease, because the person goes to his eternal home, and mourners will gather in the marketplace.
21Ec 12:6 When the silver cord is severed, the golden vessel is broken, the pitcher is shattered at the fountain, and the wheel is broken at the cistern,
21Ec 12:7 then man's dust will go back to the earth, returning to what it was, and the spirit will return to the God who gave it.
21Ec 12:8 "Utterly pointless," says the Teacher. "Everything is pointless."
21Ec 12:9 Moreover, besides being wise himself, the Teacher taught people what he had learned by listening, making inquiries, and composing many proverbs.
21Ec 12:10 The Teacher searched to find appropriate expressions, and what is written here is right and truthful.
21Ec 12:11 Sayings from the wise are like cattle prods and well fastened nails; this masterful collection was given by one shepherd.
21Ec 12:12 So learn from them, my son. There is no end to the crafting of many books, and too much study wearies the body.
21Ec 12:13 Let the conclusion of all of these thoughts be heard£º Fear God and obey his commandments, for this is what it means to be human.
21Ec 12:14 For God will judge every deed, along with every secret, whether good or evil.

22Sg 1:1 The Most Beautiful Song by Solomon.
22Sg 1:2 Let him kiss me over and over again! Your love is better than wine.
22Sg 1:3 The fragrance of your perfumed oil is wonderful. Your name is perfume poured out. Therefore the young women love you.
22Sg 1:4 Take me with you! Let's run away! The king has brought me into his private rooms. We daughters of Jerusalem will rejoice and be happy for you. We will value your love more than wine. They love you appropriately.
22Sg 1:5 Young women of Jerusalem, I'm dark and lovely like the tents of Kedar, like the curtains of Solomon.
22Sg 1:6 Don't stare at me because I'm dark; the sun has tanned me. My mother's sons were angry with me. They made me the caretaker of the vineyards, but I didn't take care of my own vineyard.
22Sg 1:7 Tell me, you whom I love, where do you graze your flock? Where do you make your flock lie down at noon? Why should I be considered a veiled woman beside the flocks of your companions?
22Sg 1:8 If you don't know, most beautiful of women, go out after the flock and graze your young goats beside the shepherd's tents.
22Sg 1:9 My darling, I compare you to my mare among Pharaoh's chariots.
22Sg 1:10 Your cheeks are lovely with ornaments, your neck with strings of jewels.
22Sg 1:11 We will make ornaments of gold for you, along with bands of silver.
22Sg 1:12 While the king was sitting at his table, my perfume sent forth its fragrance.
22Sg 1:13 My beloved is to me a pouch of myrrh that lies between my breasts all night.
22Sg 1:14 My beloved is to me a cluster of henna blossoms in the vineyards of En-gedi.
22Sg 1:15 Look at you! You are beautiful, my darling. Look at you! You are so beautiful. Your eyes are doves.
22Sg 1:16 Look at you! You are handsome, my beloved, truly lovely. How lush is our couch.
22Sg 1:17 The beams of our house are cedar, our rafters are pine.
22Sg 2:1 I'm a flower from Sharon, a lily from the valleys.
22Sg 2:2 Like a lily among thorns, so is my darling among the young women.
22Sg 2:3 Like an apple tree among the trees of the forest, so is my beloved among the young men. In his shade I take delight and sit down, and his fruit is sweet to my taste.
22Sg 2:4 He has brought me to the banquet hall, and his banner over me is love.
22Sg 2:5 Sustain me with raisin cakes, refresh me with apples, for I'm weak with love.
22Sg 2:6 I wish that his left hand were under my head, and that his right hand were embracing me!
22Sg 2:7 Swear to me, young women of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the does of the field, that you won't awaken or arouse love before its proper time!
22Sg 2:8 The voice of my beloved! Look, he's coming, leaping over the mountains, bounding over the hills.
22Sg 2:9 My beloved is like a gazelle or a young stag. Look, there he stands behind our wall, looking through the windows, gazing through the lattice.
22Sg 2:10 My beloved spoke to me, "Get up, my darling, my beautiful one, and come on.
22Sg 2:11 Look, winter is past. The rain is over and gone.
22Sg 2:12 Blossoms have appeared in the land. The season of songbirds has arrived, and cooing of turtledoves is heard in our land.
22Sg 2:13 The fig tree has produced its fruit, the grapevines have blossomed and exude their fragrance. "Get up, my darling, my beautiful one, and come on.
22Sg 2:14 My dove, in the hidden places of the rocks, in the secret places of the cliffs, show me your form, and let me hear your voice. For your voice is pleasant, and your shape is lovely.
22Sg 2:15 Catch the foxes for us, the little foxes that destroy the vineyards, our vineyards that are in bloom."
22Sg 2:16 My beloved belongs to me and I belong to him. He is the one who shepherds his flock among the lilies.
22Sg 2:17 Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, turn around, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of Bether.
22Sg 3:1 Night after night on my bed I sought the one I love I sought him but didn't find him.
22Sg 3:2 I'll get up and go all around the city, in the streets and in the squares. I'll seek the one I love. I sought him but didn't find him.
22Sg 3:3 The watchmen who go all around the city found me. I asked, "Have you seen the one I love?"
22Sg 3:4 I had just passed them, and then I found the one I love. I held him and wouldn't let him go, until I brought him to my mother's house to the room of the one who conceived me.
22Sg 3:5 Swear to me, young women of Jerusalem, by the gazelles or by the does of the field, that you won't awaken or arouse love before its proper time!
22Sg 3:6 What is this coming up from the desert like columns of smoke, perfumed with myrrh and incense from all the fragrant powders of the merchant?
22Sg 3:7 Look, it's Solomon's sedan chair! Sixty of the best soldiers in Israel surround it.
22Sg 3:8 All of them are wearing swords and are experienced in battle. Each has his sword on his thigh, ready for the terror of the night.
22Sg 3:9 King Solomon made the sedan chair for himself from the trees of Lebanon.
22Sg 3:10 He made its posts of silver, its back of gold. Its seat was purple, and its interior was lovingly inlaid by the young women of Jerusalem.
22Sg 3:11 Come out, young women of Zion. See King Solomon with the crown with which his mother crowned him on his wedding day, his day of great delight.
22Sg 4:1 Look at you! You are beautiful, my darling. Look at you! You are so beautiful. Your eyes behind your veil are doves, your hair is like a flock of goats coming down from Mt. Gilead.
22Sg 4:2 Your teeth are like a flock of sheep about to be sheared, who are coming up from being washed. All of them are twins, not one has lost her young.
22Sg 4:3 Your lips are like a scarlet thread and your mouth is lovely. Your temple behind your veil is like a slice of pomegranate.
22Sg 4:4 Your neck is like the tower of David, built with rows of stones. A thousand shields are hung upon it, all the weapons of the warriors.
22Sg 4:5 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle grazing among the lilies.
22Sg 4:6 Until the day breaks and the shadows flee, I'll go to the mountain of myrrh and to the hill of frankincense.
22Sg 4:7 My darling, you are altogether beautiful and there is no blemish in you.
22Sg 4:8 Come with me from Lebanon, my bride, come with me from Lebanon. May you journey from the top of Amana, from the tops of Senir and Hermon, from the dens of lions, from the mountain lairs of leopards.
22Sg 4:9 You have made my heart beat faster, my sister, my bride. You have made my heart beat faster with one glance of your eyes, with one strand of your necklace.
22Sg 4:10 How beautiful is your love, my sister, my bride. How much better is your love than wine, and the fragrance of your perfume than all kinds of spices.
22Sg 4:11 Your lips drip honey, my bride; milk and honey are under your tongue. The scent of your garments is like the fragrance of Lebanon.
22Sg 4:12 My sister, my bride, is a locked garden a locked rock garden, a sealed up spring.
22Sg 4:13 Your shoots are an orchard of pomegranates, with choice fruit, henna with nard,
22Sg 4:14 nard and saffron, calmus and cinnamon, with all the trees of frankincense, along with myrrh and aloes, and all the finest spices.
22Sg 4:15 You are a garden spring, a well of fresh water, streams flowing from Lebanon.
22Sg 4:16 Awake, north wind, and come, south wind. Make my garden breathe out, let its fragrance flow. Let my beloved come into his garden, and let him eat its choice fruits.
22Sg 5:1 I've come into my garden, my sister, my bride; I've gathered my myrrh with my spices. I've eaten myhoneycombwithmyhoney. I've drunk my wine with my milk. Eat, friends, drink and become drunk, lovers.
22Sg 5:2 I was asleep, but my heart was awake. There's a sound! My beloved is knocking. "Open up for me, my sister, my darling, my dove, my perfect one. For my head is drenched with dew, my hair with the dampness of the night."
22Sg 5:3 "I've taken off my clothes? am I supposed to put them on again? I've washed my feet? am I supposed to get them dirty again?"
22Sg 5:4 My beloved reached out his hand for the latch. My feelings for him were aroused.
22Sg 5:5 I got up to open the door, and my hands dripped with myrrh, my fingers with liquid myrrh, on the handle of the lock.
22Sg 5:6 I opened the door for my beloved, but my beloved had turned away; he was gone! My very life went out when he departed. I searched for him, but couldn't find him. I called out to him, but he didn't answer.
22Sg 5:7 The watchmen making their rounds through the city found me. They beat me, they bruised me. Those guarding the walls took my coat from me.
22Sg 5:8 I charge you, young women of Jerusalem, "If you find my beloved, what are you to tell him? Tell him that I'm weak with love."
22Sg 5:9 What is so special about your beloved, most beautiful of women? What is so special about your beloved, that you charge us like this?
22Sg 5:10 My beloved is dazzling with a dark and healthy complexion, outstanding among ten thousand.
22Sg 5:11 His head is pure gold, his hair is wavy, black like a raven.
22Sg 5:12 His eyes are like doves by streams of water, bathed in milk, mounted like jewels.
22Sg 5:13 His cheeks are like beds of spices, like towers of perfume. His lips are lilies, dripping with liquid myrrh.
22Sg 5:14 His hands are rods of gold, set with beryl. His stomach is carved ivory, inlaid with sapphires.
22Sg 5:15 His legs are pillars of marble set on bases of pure gold. His appearance is like Lebanon, choice like its cedars.
22Sg 5:16 His mouth is sweetness, and all of him is desirable. This is my beloved, this is my friend, young women of Jerusalem!
22Sg 6:1 Where did your beloved go, most beautiful of women? Where did your beloved turn, so we may look for him with you?
22Sg 6:2 My beloved has gone down to his garden, to the beds of spices, to graze his flock in the gardens and gather lilies.
22Sg 6:3 I belong to my beloved, and my beloved belongs to me. He is the one who grazes his flock among the lilies.
22Sg 6:4 You are beautiful, my darling, like Tirzah, lovely like Jerusalem, as awesome as an army with banners.
22Sg 6:5 Turn your eyes from me, for they excite me. Your hair is like a flock of goats coming down from Mt. Gilead.
22Sg 6:6 Your teeth are like a flock of ewes that are coming up from being washed. All of them are twins, not one has lost her young.
22Sg 6:7 Your temple behind your veil is like a slice of pomegranate.
22Sg 6:8 There are sixty queens and eighty mistresses, and too many young women to count,
22Sg 6:9 but my dove, my perfect one, is unique. She's unique to her mother, she's pure to the one who gave birth to her. Young women see her and call her blessed, queens and mistresses praise her.
22Sg 6:10 Who is this who appears like the dawn, beautiful as the moon, pure as the sun, awesome as an army with banners?
22Sg 6:11 I went down to the walnut orchard, to look at the green sprouts in the valley, to see whether the vine had budded, whether the pomegranates had blossomed.
22Sg 6:12 Before I knew it, I imagined myself in the chariots of my noble people.
22Sg 6:13 Return, return, Shulamite, return, return, so we may look at you! Why should you look at the Shulamite, like you watch the dance of the two camps?
22Sg 7:1 How beautiful are your feet in sandals, noble lady. The curves of your thighs are like ornaments, the work of a skilled artist's hands.
22Sg 7:2 Your navel is a rounded goblet that never lacks mixed wine. Your abdomen is a bundle of wheat, enclosed by lilies.
22Sg 7:3 Your two breasts are like two fawns, twins of a gazelle.
22Sg 7:4 Your neck is like a tower of ivory. Your eyes are like the pools in Heshbon, beside the gate of Beth-rabbim. Your nose is like the tower of Lebanon, which faces Damascus.
22Sg 7:5 Your head crowns you like Mt. Carmel. Your flowing locks are like purple, and a king is captured in the dangling tresses.
22Sg 7:6 How beautiful and lovely you are, you are love with its exquisite delights.
22Sg 7:7 Your stature is like a palm tree, and your breasts are like clusters of fruit.
22Sg 7:8 I said to myself, "I'll go up the palm tree, and take hold of its fruit. May your breasts be like clusters of the vine, and the smell of your breath like apples.
22Sg 7:9 May your mouth be like good wine. May it go down smoothly to my beloved, gliding gently over the lips of the sleeping ones.
22Sg 7:10 I belong to my beloved, and his desire is for me.
22Sg 7:11 Come, my beloved. Let us go out to the country, let us spend the night in the villages.
22Sg 7:12 Let us get up early and go to the vineyards, let us see whether the vine has budded, whether the blossom has opened, whether the pomegranate has bloomed. There I'll give you my love.
22Sg 7:13 The mandrakes give off their fragrance, and over our doors are all the choice fruits, both old and new, that I've stored up for you, my beloved.
22Sg 8:1 If only you were like a brother to me, like one who nursed at my mother's breasts. If I found you outside I would kiss you, and no one would view me with contempt.
22Sg 8:2 I would lead you, I would bring you to the house of my mother who used to teach me. I would give you some spiced wine to drink, from the juice of my pomegranates.
22Sg 8:3 Let his left hand be under my head, and let his right hand embrace me.
22Sg 8:4 Swear to me, young women of Jerusalem, that you won't awaken or arouse love before its proper time!
22Sg 8:5 Who is this coming up from the desert, leaning on her beloved? Under theappletree I awakened you. There your mother had gone into labor with you; there she went into labor and gave birth to you.
22Sg 8:6 Set me like a seal over your heart, like a seal on your arm. For love is as strong as death, passion as intense as Sheol. The flames of love are flames of fire, a blaze that comes from the Lord.
22Sg 8:7 A great deal of water cannot extinguish love, rivers cannot put it out. If a man were to give all the wealth of his house for love, he would surely be viewed with contempt.
22Sg 8:8 We have a little sister, and she has not yet reached maturity. What shall we do for our sister to prepare her for her engagement?
22Sg 8:9 If she's a wall, on her we will build a battlement of silver. If she's a door, we will enclose her with planks of cedar.
22Sg 8:10 I was a wall and my breasts were like towers. Then I became like one who finds peace in his eyes.
22Sg 8:11 Solomon has a vineyard in Baal-hamon. He entrusted the vineyard to caretakers, and each one is to bring 1,000 pieces of silver in exchange for its fruit.
22Sg 8:12 My vineyard belongs to me and is at my disposal. The 1,000 are for you, Solomon, and 200 are for those who take care of its fruit.
22Sg 8:13 You who sit in the gardens, companions are listening for your voice, but let me hear it.
22Sg 8:14 Come quickly, my beloved, and be like a gazelle or a young stag on the mountains of spices.

23Is 1:1 This is a record of the vision that Amoz's son Isaiah observed concerning Judah and Jerusalem during the reigns of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah.
23Is 1:2 Listen, you heavens, and let the earth pay attention, because the Lord has spoken£º "I reared children and brought them to adulthood, but then they rebelled against me!
23Is 1:3 The ox knows its owner, and the donkey its master's feeding trough, but Israel doesn't know, and my people don't understand.
23Is 1:4 "Ah, you sinful nation! You people burdened down by iniquity! You offspring of those who keep practicing what is evil! You children who corrupt whatever they do! "They've abandoned the Lord; They've despised the Holy One of Israel, in their estrangement, they've walked away from me.
23Is 1:5 "Why will you still be struck down? Why will you continue to rebel? Your whole head is sick, and your whole heart is faint.
23Is 1:6 From the sole of your foot to the top of your head, There's no soundness in it, only bruises, sores, and festering wounds that haven't been cleaned out, or bound up, or treated with oil."
23Is 1:7 "Your country lies desolate; your cities have been incinerated. Before your very eyes, foreigners are devouring your land. They've brought devastation upon it, while the land is overthrown by foreigners. 
23Is 1:8 The daughter of Zion is left like a booth in a vineyard, like a lodge in a cucumber field, or like a city under seige.
23Is 1:9 If the Lord of the Heavenly Armies hadn't left us a few survivors, we would be like Sodom; we would be like Gomorrah."
23Is 1:10 Listen to what the Lord says, you rulers of Sodom, and pay attention to the teaching of our God, you people of Gomorrah!
23Is 1:11 "How do your voluminous sacrifices benefit me?" the Lord is asking. "I've had enough of burnt offerings of rams and the fat of well-fed beasts. I don't enjoy the blood of bulls, or of lambs, or of goats.
23Is 1:12 "When you come to present yourselves in my presence, who has required you to trample on my courts?
23Is 1:13 Stop bringing useless offerings! Your incense is detestable to me, as are your new moons, Sabbaths, and calling of convocations. I cannot stand iniquity with a solemn assembly.
23Is 1:14 As to your new moons and your appointed feasts, my soul abhors them. They've become a burden to me; I've grown weary of carrying them.
23Is 1:15 When you spread out your hands, I'll hide my eyes from you. Even though your prayers multiply, I won't listen. Your hands are full of blood, your fingers drenched in iniquity."
23Is 1:16 "Wash yourselves, and make yourselves clean; remove the evil of your deeds from my presence; stop practicising what is evil.
23Is 1:17 Learn to practice what is good; seek justice, correct oppression, defend orphans in court, and plead the widow's case.
23Is 1:18 "Please come, and let's reason together," implores the Lord. "Even though your sins are like scarlet, they'll be white like snow. Though they're like crimson, they'll become like wool.
23Is 1:19 If you're willing and obedient, you'll eat the best that the land produced; 
23Is 1:20 but if you refuse and rebel, you'll be devoured by the sword, because the Lord has spoken."
23Is 1:21 "How the faithful city has become a whore, she who used to be filled with justice! Righteousness used to reside within her, but now only murderers live there.
23Is 1:22 Your silver has become dross, your best wine is diluted with water.
23Is 1:23 Your princes are rebels and companions of thieves. All of them are lovers of bribes and are runners after gifts. They do not bring justice to orphans, and the widow's case never comes before them."
23Is 1:24 Therefore this is what the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies declares, the one who is Israel's Mighty One£º "Ah, I'll get relief from his enemies and avenge myself on his foes. 
23Is 1:25 Turning my attention in your direction, I'll refine your dross as in a furnace. Let me remove all your alloy.
23Is 1:26 Let me restore your judges as at the first, and your counselors as at the beginning. Afterward you'll be called "The Righteous City" and "The Faithful City of Zion. 
23Is 1:27 "Zion will be redeemed by justice, and her repentant ones by righteousness.
23Is 1:28 But rebels and sinners will be broken together, and those who forsake the Lord will be consumed.
23Is 1:29 They'll be ashamed of the oaks that you desired; and you'll blush because of the gardens that you have chosen.
23Is 1:30 You'll be like an oak1 whose leaf is withering, like an unwatered garden.
23Is 1:31 Your strong one will be used for tinder, and your work a spark; both of them will burn together, with no one to quench them."
23Is 2:1 The message that Amoz's son Isaiah observed concerning Judah and Jerusalem£º 
23Is 2:2 It will come about in the last days that the mountain of the house of the Lord will be established as the highest of mountains, and will be raised above the hills; all the nations will stream to it.
23Is 2:3 Many groups of people will come, commenting, "Come! Let's go up to the house of the God of Jacob, that they may teach us his ways. Then let's walk in his paths." "Because instruction will proceed from Zion, and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem.
23Is 2:4 He will judge between the nations, and will render verdicts for the benefit of many. "They will beat their swords into plowshares, and their spears into pruning hooks; nations will not raise swords against nations, and they will not learn warfare anymore.
23Is 2:5 "You house of Jacob! Come! Let's walk in the light of the Lord.
23Is 2:6 For you have rejected your people, the house of Jacob, because they are filled with practices learned from the East and they are fortune-tellers like the Philistines. They cut deals with foreigners. 
23Is 2:7 Their land is filled with silver and gold, and there is no end to their treasures; their land is filled with horses, and there is no end to their chariots.
23Is 2:8 Their land is filled with idols; they bow down to the work of their hands, to what their own fingers have made.
23Is 2:9 "So mankind is humbled, each human being is brought low, and you won't forgive."
23Is 2:10 "Go into the rocks! Hide in the dust to escape the terror of the Lord and to escape the glory of his majesty!
23Is 2:11 The haughty looks of mankind will be brought low, the lofty pride of human beings will be humbled, and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.
23Is 2:12 "For the Lord of the Heavenly Armies has reserved a day to oppose all who are proud and haughty, and to oppose the self-exalting. They will be humbled.
23Is 2:13 He will take his stand against all the cedars of Lebanon, against the proud and self-exalting; and against all the oaks of Bashan;
23Is 2:14 against all the high mountains, and against all the lofty hills;
23Is 2:15 against every high tower, and against every fortified wall;
23Is 2:16 against all the ships from Tarshish, and against all their impressive watercraft. 
23Is 2:17 "Humanity's haughtiness will be humbled, male arrogance will be brought low, and the Lord alone will be exalted in that day.
23Is 2:18 "Their idols will utterly vanish.
23Is 2:19 "They will enter caverns in the rocks and holes in the ground, to escape the presence of the terror of the Lord, to escape the splendor of his majesty, when he arises to terrify the earth.
23Is 2:20 At that time mankind will throw away their silver and gold idols that their fingers made as objects of worship to the moles and to the bats. 
23Is 2:21 They will enter caverns in the rocks and clefts in the cliffs, to escape the terror of the Lord and to escape the splendor of his majesty, when he arises to terrorize the earth. 
23Is 2:22 "Stop trusting in human beings whose life breath is in their nostrils, for what is he really worth?" 
23Is 3:1 Note this! The Lord God of the Heavenly Armies is taking away from Jerusalem and from Judah everything that supplies your society? all food supplies and all water supplies;
23Is 3:2 the mighty man and the warrior, the judge and the prophet, the fortune-teller and the elder,
23Is 3:3 the commander of fifty and the man of rank, the counselor, the expert magician, and the medium. 
23Is 3:4 "I will make boys their princes, and infants will rule over them.
23Is 3:5 People will oppress one another£º It will be man against man and neighbor against neighbor. The young will be disrespectful to the old, and the worthless to the honorable."
23Is 3:6 For a man will grab his brother in his own father's house! He'll say, "You have a cloak, So you be our leader, and this heap of ruins will be under your rule!"
23Is 3:7 But at that time he'll protest! He'll say, "I won't be your healer. I have neither food nor clothing in my house! You're not going to make me a leader of the people!"
23Is 3:8 For Jerusalem has stumbled, and Judah has fallen, because what they say and do opposes the Lord; they keep defying his glorious presence.
23Is 3:9 The expressions on their faces give them away. They parade their sin around like Sodom; they don't even try to hide it. How horrible it will be for them, because they have brought disaster on themselves!
23Is 3:10 Tell the righteous that things will go well, because they will enjoy the fruit of their actions. 
23Is 3:11 How terrible it will be for the wicked! Disaster is headed their way, because what they did with their hand will be repaid to them. 
23Is 3:12 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women rule over them. O my people, your leaders are misleading you? they're giving you confusing directions.
23Is 3:13 The Lord is taking his place to argue his case; he is standing up to judge the peoples. 
23Is 3:14 The Lord will go to court to oppose the elders and princes of his people£º "You're the ones who have been devouring the vineyard, the plunder of the poor lives in your own houses!
23Is 3:15 How dare you crush my people as you grind down the face of the poor?" declares the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies.
23Is 3:16 The Lord also says "Because Zion's women are so haughty, and walk with outstretched necks, flirting with their eyes, prancing along as they walk, and making tinkling noises with their ankle bracelets,
23Is 3:17 therefore the Lord will afflict sores on the heads of Zion's women, and the Lord will expose their private parts."
23Is 3:18 At that time, the Lord will take away the finery of the ankle bracelets, the headbands, and the crescents;
23Is 3:19 the pendants, bracelets, and veils;
23Is 3:20 the headdresses, armlets, sashes, perfume boxes, and charms;
23Is 3:21 the signet rings and nose rings;
23Is 3:22 the fine robes, capes, and purses;
23Is 3:23 the mirrors, linen garments, tiaras, and veils.
23Is 3:24 "And it will come about that instead of fragrance there will be a stench; instead of a belt, a rope; instead of well-set hair, baldness; instead of a fine robe, sackcloth; and instead of beauty, shame.
23Is 3:25 Your men will die violently, while your forces fall in battle. 
23Is 3:26 Her gates will lament and mourn. Ravaged, she will sit on the ground."
23Is 4:1 At that time, seven women will cling tightly to one man, and they will make him this offer£º "We'll provide our own bread. We'll provide our own clothes. Just let us marry you. Remove our embarrasment."
23Is 4:2 At that time, the Lord's branch will be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the land will be the pride and glory of the survivors of Israel and Judah.
23Is 4:3 Whoever survives in Zion and whoever remains in Jerusalem will be called holy?everyone who has been appointed to survive in Jerusalem?
23Is 4:4 when the Lord will have washed away the filth of the women of Zion, cleaning up Jerusalem's guilt by a spirit of judgment and a spirit of tempest.
23Is 4:5 Then the Lord will create over the entire site of Mount Zion?including over those who assemble there?a cloud by day, accompanied by smoke, as well as the brilliance of a flaming fire by night, because over the entire glorious area there will be a canopy and
23Is 4:6 a shelter to protect from the heat of the day and also to serve as a refuge and shelter from storms and rain.
23Is 5:1 I will sing for my beloved my love-song concerning his vineyard£º
23Is 5:2 "The one I love had a vineyard on a very fertile hill. He plowed its land and cleared it of stones. Then he planted it with the choicest vines, built a watchtower in the midle of it, and hewed out a wine vat in it; He expected it to produce good grapes, but it produced only wild ones."
23Is 5:3 So now, you inhabitants of Jerusalem and men of Judah, judge, won't you please, between me and my vineyard. 
23Is 5:4 What more could I do in my vineyard, that I haven't already done in it? When I expected it to produce good grapes, why did it raise wild ones?
23Is 5:5 Let me tell you, won't you please, what I'm gong to do to my vineyard. I'm going to take away its protective hedge,and it will be devoured; I will break down its wall, and it will be trampled down.
23Is 5:6 I will make it a wasteland, and it will not be pruned or cultivated. Instead, briers and thorns will grow up. I will also issue commands to the clouds, that they drop no rain upon it.
23Is 5:7 For the vineyard of the Lord of the Heavenly Armiesis the house of Israel, and the men of Judah are the garden in which he delights; and he looked for justice, but saw only bloodshed; he searched for righteousness, but heard only an outcry!
23Is 5:8 How terrible it will be for you who join house to house, who add field to field, until there is no more room, and you have settled yourselves alone in the middle of the land!
23Is 5:9 The Lord of the Heavenly Armies has declared in my hearing£º "Surely many houses will become desolate, great and beautiful houses, without occupants.
23Is 5:10 For ten acres of vineyard will produce only six gallons, and ten bushels of seed will produce only one bushel."
23Is 5:11 How terrible it will be for those who rise at dawn in order to grab a stiff drink; for those who stay up late at night as wine inflames them!
23Is 5:12 They have the lyre and harp, the tambourine and flute, as well as wine at their feasts, but they don't respect what the the Lord is doing, nor do they consider what he's working on with his hands. 
23Is 5:13 Therefore my people go into exile for lack of understanding; my honored men go hungry, and their multitude is parched with thirst. 
23Is 5:14 Therefore Sheol has enlarged its appetite and opened its mouth beyond limit. Jerusalem's nobility and her multitude will descend, along with her brawlers and whoever is reveling within her.
23Is 5:15 Mankind is brought low, and each one is humbled, while the eyes of the self-exalting are brought low.
23Is 5:16 But the Lord of the Heavenly Armies is exalted in justice, and the Holy God proves himself holy in righteousness.
23Is 5:17 Then the lambs will graze, at home in their pasture, and fatlings and strangers will eat among the waste places of the rich.
23Is 5:18 How terrible it will be for those who parade iniquity with cords of falsehood, who draw sin along, as with a cart rope,
23Is 5:19 who say£º "Let God be quick, let him speed up his work so we may see it!. Let it happen! let the plan of the Holy One of Israel draw near, so we may recognize it!"
23Is 5:20 How terrible it will be for those who call evil good and good evil, who substitute darkness for light and light for darkness, who substitute what is bitter for what is sweet and what is sweet for what is bitter! 
23Is 5:21 How terrible it will be for those who are wise in their own opinion, and clever in their own reckoning!
23Is 5:22 How terrible it will be for those who are heroes at drinking wine, and champions in mixing strong drink, 
23Is 5:23 who acquit the guilty for a bribe, and deprive the innocent of justice!
23Is 5:24 Therefore, as flames of fire devour straw, and as dry grass collapses in a conflagration, so their root will be as rottenness, and their blossom will blow away like dust; because they have rejected the instruction of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, and have despised the word of the Holy One of Israel. 
23Is 5:25 Therefore the anger of the Lord burned against his people, so he stretched out his hands against them and afflicted them. The mountains quaked, and their corpses were like refuse in the middle of the streets. Throughout all of this, his anger has not turned away, and his hands are still stretched out to attack. 
23Is 5:26 The Lord will signal for nations far away, whistling for them to come from the ends of the earth. Look how quickly and how swiftly they come!
23Is 5:27 No one is weary, no one stumbles, and no one slumbers or sleeps. No belt around their waists will come undone, nor will their sandal straps be broken;
23Is 5:28 Their arrows are sharp, all their bows ready for action. Their horses' hooves seem like flint, and their chariot wheels spin like a whirlwind.
23Is 5:29 With a roar like a lion, they snarl, and like young lions, they growl;5 they seize their prey and then carry it off, with no one to rescue.
23Is 5:30 They will roar over it at that time, like the sea waves roar. If one surveys the land, watch out! There's darkness and distress; even the light is darkened by its clouds.
23Is 6:1 In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord sitting upon his throne, high and lifted up. The train of his robe filled the temple.
23Is 6:2 The seraphim stood above him. Each had six wings£º with two he covered his face, and with two he covered his feet, and with two he was flying.
23Is 6:3 They kept on calling to each other£º "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of the Heavenly Armies! The whole earth is full of his glory!"
23Is 6:4 The foundations of the thresholds quaked at the sound of those who kept calling out, and the temple was filled with smoke.
23Is 6:5 "How terrible it will be for me!" I cried, "because I am ruined! I'm a man with unclean lips, and I live among of a people with unclean lips! And my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of the Heavenly Armies!"
23Is 6:6 Then one of the seraphim flew to me, carrying a burning coal in his hand that he had taken from the altar with tongs.
23Is 6:7 He touched my mouth and said, "Look! Now that this has touched your lips, your guilt is taken away, and your sins atoned for."
23Is 6:8 Then I heard the voice of the Lord as he was asking, "Whom shall I send? Who will go for us?" "Here I am!" I replied. "Send me."
23Is 6:9 "Go!" he responded. "Tell this people£º "'Keep on hearing, but do not understand; keep on seeing, but do not perceive.'
23Is 6:10 Dull the mind of this people, deafen their ears, and blind their eyes. By doing so, they won't see with their eyes, hear with their ears, understand with their minds, turn back, and be healed."
23Is 6:11 Then I asked, "For how long, O Lord?" In reply, he responded£º "Until cities lie waste, without inhabitants, and houses without people; and the land becomes utterly desolate. 
23Is 6:12 Until the Lord removes people far away, and there are many empty places in the middle of the land.
23Is 6:13 Even though a tenth of its people remain in it, it will once again be burned, like a terebinth or an oak tree, the stump of which, though the tree has been felled, still contains holy seed."
23Is 7:1 During the reign of Jothan's son Ahaz, Uzziah's grandson, king of Judah, King Rezin of Aram and Remaliah's son Pekah, king of Israel, approached Jerusalem and waged war against it, but they could not mount an attack against it.
23Is 7:2 When it was reported to the house of David, "Aram has joined forces with Ephraim!" the heart of the people of Ahaz trembled like forest trees in a windstorm.
23Is 7:3 So the Lord told Isaiah, "Go out to meet Ahaz, you and your son Shear-jashub, at the end of the aqueduct of the Upper Pool that proceeds along the highway to Washerman's Field.
23Is 7:4 Tell him, 'Be careful, be calm, don't be afraid., and don't lose heart because of these two smoldering stumps of torches, that is, because of the fierce anger of Rezin, from Aram, and Remaliah's son.
23Is 7:5 Aram, Ephraim, and Remaliah's son have plotted this evil against you£º
23Is 7:6 "Let's go attack Judah, let's terrorize it, and let's conquer it for ourselves. Then we'll install Tabeel's son as king!"' 
23Is 7:7 "'But this is what the Lord God has to say£º "'It won't take place. It won't ever happen.
23Is 7:8 Because Aram's head is Damascus, and Rezin is its king, within sixty-five years Ephraim will be shattered as a people.
23Is 7:9 Furthermore, Ephraim's head is Samaria, and Remaliah's son is its king. If all of you don't keep on believing, you'll never remain loyal.'"
23Is 7:10 Later on, the Lord spoke to Ahaz again£º
23Is 7:11 "Ask a sign from the Lord your God. Make it as deep as Sheol or as high as heaven above."
23Is 7:12 But Ahaz replied, "I won't ask! I won't put the Lord to the test."
23Is 7:13 In reply, he announced, "Please listen, you household of David. Is it such a minor thing for you to try the patience of men? Must you also try the patience of my God?
23Is 7:14 "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign. Watch! The young lady is conceiving a child, and will give birth to a son, and his name will be called Immanuel.
23Is 7:15 He'll eat cheese and honey, when he knows enough to reject what's wrong and choose what's right.
23Is 7:16 However, before the youth knows enough to reject what's wrong and choose what's right, the land whose two kings you dread will be devastated."
23Is 7:17 "The Lord will bring to you, to your people, and to your ancestor's house such a time as has never come since Ephraim broke away from Judah?the king of Assyria will come.
23Is 7:18 "At that time, the Lord will call for flies that will come from far away?from the headwaters of Egypt's rivers?and for bees that are in the land of Assyria.
23Is 7:19 They will all come and settle in the steep ravines, in the rocky crevices, in all the thornbushes, and in all the pastures.
23Is 7:20 At that time, the Lord will hire a barber to come from beyond the Euphrates River?that is, the king of Assyria?and he will shave your heads, your leg hair, and your beards, too.
23Is 7:21 "At that time, a man will keep alive a heifer and two sheep,
23Is 7:22 and because of the abundance of milk that they give, he will have cheese to eat, since whoever remains in the land will be eating cheese and honey.
23Is 7:23 "At that time, every place where once there were a thousand vines worth a thousand shekels of silver, only briars and thorns will grow.
23Is 7:24 People will come there armed with bow and arrows, because the entire land will be nothing but briers and thorns.
23Is 7:25 As for all hills that used to be cultivated with a hoe, you will not go there, because you'll fear iron briars and thorns. Nevertheless, those hills will be reserved as a pasture where cattle will feed and where sheep will graze.
23Is 8:1 The Lord also told me, "Take a large tablet and write on it with a stylus pen, 'For Maher-shalal-hash-baz'.
23Is 8:2 Then I will call Uriah the priest and Jeberechiah's son Zechariah as reliable witnesses to testify on my behalf."
23Is 8:3 After this I was intimate with the prophetess and she conceived. Later, she bore a son, and then the Lord told me, "Call him 'Maher-shalal-hash-baz,'
23Is 8:4 because before the young lad knows how to call out to his father or to his mother, the wealth of Damascus and the plunder of Samaria will be carried off by the king of Assyria."
23Is 8:5 Later, the Lord spoke to me again£º
23Is 8:6 "Because this people have rejected the gently-flowing waters of Shiloah, and because they keep rejoicing in Rezin and Remaliah's son,
23Is 8:7 watch out! The Lord God is about to bring up the flood waters of the Euphrates River against them, mighty and strong. "It's the king of Assyria and all of his arrogance! He will rise over all its channels and run over all its banks.
23Is 8:8 He will sweep on into Judah, overflowing as he passes through, reaching up to the neck. His outstretched wings will flow as wide as your land, O Immanuel!"
23Is 8:9 Band together, you peoples, but be shattered! Listen, all you distant countries! Strap on your armor, but be shattered.
23Is 8:10 Take counsel together, but it will all be for nothing; go ahead and talk, but it will all be for nothing, for God is with us.
23Is 8:11 For this is what the Lord spoke to me, as his forceful hand was resting on me, and as he was warning me not to live the way this people were living£º 
23Is 8:12 "Don't you call conspiracy everything that this people calls conspiracy, and don't fear what they fear, or live in terror.
23Is 8:13 The Lord of the Heavenly Armies? he's the one you are to regard as holy. Let him be the one whom you fear, and let him be the one before whom you stand in terror!
23Is 8:14 Then he will be a sanctuary, but for both houses of Israel he will also be a stone one strikes against and a rock one stumbles over a trap and a snare to those who live in Jerusalem.
23Is 8:15 Many will stumble on them; they will fall and be broken; they will be snared and captured."
23Is 8:16 Bind up the testimony, and seal up the teaching among my disciples.
23Is 8:17 I will wait for the Lord, who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob, and I will put my trust in him.
23Is 8:18 Behold, I and the children whom the Lord has given me are a sign and wonder in Israel from the Lord of the Heavenly Armies, who resides on Mount Zion.
23Is 8:19 So when they advise you, "Ask the mediums your questions, and quiz the spiritists who twitter and mutter!" shouldn't a people instead be consulting their God? and not the dead?on behalf of those who are living
23Is 8:20 for instruction and for testimony? Surely they are speaking like this because the truth hasn't dawned on them.
23Is 8:21 They will pass through the land, while greatly distressed and hungry. When they are hungry, they'll become enraged, and they'll curse their king and their gods. They'll turn their faces upwards,
23Is 8:22 or they'll look toward the earth, but they'll see only distress and darkness, the gloom that comes from anguish, and then they'll be expelled into total darkness.
