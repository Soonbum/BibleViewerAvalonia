111Kg 1:1 When David had grown very old, they covered him with blankets, but he could not keep warm, 
111Kg 1:2 so his servants suggested to him, "Let's look for a young virgin woman to take care of you, your majesty. She will be of use to you if you have her lie down near you so that your majesty may keep warm." 
111Kg 1:3 So they conducted a search throughout the territory of Israel for a beautiful young woman, and Abishag the Shunnamite was located and brought to the king. 
111Kg 1:4 The young woman was absolutely beautiful. She served the king and was very useful to him. The king was not sexually involved with her.
111Kg 1:5 Meanwhile, about this time Haggith's son Adonijah began to seek a reputation for himself and decided, "I'm going to be king!" So he prepared chariots, cavalry, and 50 soldiers to serve as a security detail to guard him. 
111Kg 1:6 His father had never challenged him at any time during his life by asking him, "Why are you acting like this?" Adonijah was very handsome and had been born after Absalom. 
111Kg 1:7 He had the support of Zeruiah's son Joab and of Abiathar the priest, who followed Adonijah and assisted him, 
111Kg 1:8 but Zadok the priest, Jehoiada's son Benaiah, Nathan the prophet, Shimei, Rei, and David's personal elite forces would have nothing to do with Adonijah.
111Kg 1:9 Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fatted cattle by the Serpent Stone near Enrogel, inviting all of his relatives, the king's sons, and all of the men of Judah who worked for the king, 
111Kg 1:10 but he did not invite Nathan the prophet, Benaiah, David's personal elite forces, or his brother Solomon.
111Kg 1:11 "Haven't you heard?" Nathan asked Solomon's mother Bathsheba. "Haggith's son Adonijah has become king and David, our true king, isn't aware of it?
111Kg 1:12 If you listen to me, you'll save your life and the life of your son Solomon. 
111Kg 1:13 Go right now to King David and ask him, 'Your majesty, you promised your servant that "Your son Solomon will certainly become king after me and shall sit on my throne," didn't you?So why has Adonijah become king?' 
111Kg 1:14 Then, while you are still talking to the king, I'll come in after you and verify your statement."
111Kg 1:15 So Bathsheba went to the king in his private room. Now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunnamite was attending to him. 
111Kg 1:16 Bathsheba knelt and bowed down to the king, and the king asked her, "What do you wish?"
111Kg 1:17 "Your majesty," she replied, "you promised your servant in the name of the Lord your God, 'Your son Solomon will certainly become king after me and shall sit on my throne.' 
111Kg 1:18 Now look, Adonijah has become king, and your majesty is not aware of it. 
111Kg 1:19 Adonijah has sacrificed myriads of oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep, and he has invited all of the king's sons, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army, but he has not invited your servant Solomon. 
111Kg 1:20 And as for you, your majesty, everyone in Israel is looking to you to tell them who will sit on your majesty's throne after you. 
111Kg 1:21 Otherwise, as soon as your majesty is laid to rest with his ancestors, my son Solomon and I will be branded as traitors."
111Kg 1:22 While she was still talking to the king, Nathan the prophet arrived. 
111Kg 1:23 They informed the king, "Nathan the prophet is here." When he had been ushered into the presence of the king, Nathan bowed low in front of the king with his face to the ground 
111Kg 1:24 and asked, "Your majesty, didn't you say 'Adonijah shall be king after me and shall sit on my throne'?
111Kg 1:25 Well now, he went down today and sacrificed lots of oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep, and has invited all the king's sons, the army commanders, and Abiathar the priest. They're having a party together and saying, 'Long live King Adonijah!' 
111Kg 1:26 Of course, he never invited me, Zadok the priest, Jehoiada's son Benaiah, nor your servant Solomon. 
111Kg 1:27 Were you behind this, your majesty, without letting your servants know who would sit on your majesty's throne after him?"
111Kg 1:28 "Call Bathsheba for me," King David replied. So she came in and stood in front of the king. 
111Kg 1:29 "As the Lord lives," the king said with an oath, "who has redeemed me from all sorts of troubles, 
111Kg 1:30 I certainly did tell you in the name of the Lord God of Israel, 'Your son Solomon shall be king after me and shall sit on my throne in my place.' I'm certainly going to make this happen today!"
111Kg 1:31 "King David," Bathsheba said as she bowed low in front of the king with her face to the ground, "your majesty, may you live forever."
111Kg 1:32 "Get me Zadok the priest," King David said, "along with Nathan the prophet, and Jehoiada's son Benaiah." So they were ushered into the king's presence 
111Kg 1:33 and David addressed them. "Take your lord's servants, have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and take him down to Gihon. 
111Kg 1:34 Have Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet anoint him there as king over Israel. Then sound a trumpet and declare 'Long live King Solomon!' 
111Kg 1:35 After this, you are to follow him back here, and he is to come and sit on my throne and take my place as king, because I've appointed him to be commander-in-chief over Israel and Judah."
111Kg 1:36 "Amen!" replied Jehoiada's son Benaiah to the king. "May the Lord God of your majesty make this happen! 
111Kg 1:37 As the Lord has been with your majesty the king, so may he be with Solomon. May he make his throne greater than the throne of your majesty, King David."
111Kg 1:38 So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Jehoiada's son Benaiah, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites went out and had Solomon ride the king's mule all the way to Gihon. 
111Kg 1:39 Zadok the priest brought from his tent a horn filled with oil and anointed Solomon, a trumpet was sounded, and everybody yelled out, "Long live King Solomon!" 
111Kg 1:40 All the people followed after him, playing on wind pipes and so full of joy that the earth shook because of all the noise!
111Kg 1:41 Right about then, Adonijah and all of his guests were just finishing their meal when they heard all the noise. "Why is the city in such an uproar?" Joab asked as he heard the trumpet sounds.
111Kg 1:42 While he was still asking that question, Jonathan, the son of Abiathar the priest arrived, so Adonijah told him, "Come on in, since you're a worthy man and are bringing us good news!"
111Kg 1:43 "No," Jonathan answered. "Our lord King David has installed Solomon as king. 
111Kg 1:44 The king has sent Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, Jehoiada's son Benaiah, the Cherethites, and the Pelethites along with Solomon, who is riding the king's personal mule. 
111Kg 1:45 Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him in Gihon, and they just left from there rejoicing, and that's why the city is all in an uproar. That's the noise that you've been hearing! Solomon now sits on the royal throne. 
111Kg 1:47 In addition to all of this, the king's servants have come along to congratulate our lord King David. They've been telling David 'May your God make Solomon's reputation even more famous than yours, and may he make his throne greater than yours!' The king has himself bowed in worship on his own bed 
111Kg 1:48 and said 'Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who has provided someone to sit on my throne today. I've seen it with my own eyes!'"1
111Kg 1:49 Terrified, all of Adonijah's guests jumped up and ran away. 50Afraid of Solomon, Adonijah also jumped up and headed straight for the horns of the altar.49
111Kg 1:51 "Hey look!" somebody informed Solomon. "Adonijah is terrified of King Solomon! He's gone out, grabbed hold of the horns of the altar, and now he's begging King Solomon, 'Swear to me that you won't put your servant to death with a sword!'"1
111Kg 1:52 "If he's done nothing wrong, not a hair of his head will be harmed," Solomon replied. "But if we find evil in him, he's a dead man."
111Kg 1:53 So King Solomon sent for him, and he was brought down from the altar. When he had arrived, he fell on his face in front of King Solomon, so Solomon told him, "Go home!" 
111Kg 2:1 As David's time to die approached, he addressed his son Solomon with these words:
111Kg 2:2 "I'm headed down the road that everyone who lives on earth travels, so be strong and demonstrate that you're a grown man 
111Kg 2:3 by keeping the charge that the Lord your God entrusted to you. Live life his way, keep his statutes, his commands, his ordinances, and his testimonies, just as they're written down in the Law of Moses, so that you may succeed in everything you do and wherever you go, 
111Kg 2:4 and so that the Lord may fulfill his promise that he spoke about me when he said, 'If your sons pay attention to how they live by walking truthfully in my presence with all their heart and with all their soul, you will never lack a man on the throne of Israel.'
111Kg 2:5 "Furthermore, you're aware of what Zeruiah's son Joab did to me and to those two commanders of the armies of Israel, Ner's son Abner and Jether's son Amasa, whom he killed, and how he shed the blood of wartime during times of peace, staining the very belt he wears around his waist and the sandals he wears on his feet. 
111Kg 2:6 So act consistently with your wisdom, and don't let him die as a peaceful old man. 
111Kg 2:7 Be gracious to the descendants of Barzilla the Gileadite, and provide for them in your household, because they helped me when I had to run from your brother Absalom.
111Kg 2:8 "Pay attention now! You have with you Gera's son Shimei the Benjaminite from Bahurim. He cursed me violently that day when I had to leave for Mahanaim. When he visited me at the Jordan River, I made an oath to the Lord and told him, 'I won't execute you with a sword.' 
111Kg 2:9 But don't let him off unpunished, since you're a wise man and you'll know what you need to do to him. Find a way that he dies in his old age by shedding his blood."
111Kg 2:10 After this, David died, as had his ancestors, and he was buried in the city of David. David had reigned over Israel for 40 years. He reigned in Hebron for seven years and in Jerusalem for 33 years. 
111Kg 2:12 Solomon then assumed his father David's throne, and his kingdom was firmly established.
111Kg 2:13 Later, Haggith's son Adonijah approached Solomon's mother. "Are you here on a peaceful mission?" she asked. "Yes," he replied. 
111Kg 2:14 "I have something to ask you about." "Talk," she told him.
111Kg 2:15 So he replied, "You know that the kingdom should have come to me, and that everyone in Israel intended to place me as the next king. However, the kingdom has turned around and now belongs to my brother, because it went to him from the Lord. 
111Kg 2:16 So now I'm asking one thing from you. Don't refuse me." "Talk," she told him.
111Kg 2:17 Then he asked her, "Please talk to King Solomon for me, since he won't refuse you. Ask him to give me Abishag the Shunnamite as a wife."
111Kg 2:18 "Okay," Bathsheba replied. "I'll talk to the king for you." 
111Kg 2:19 So Bathsheba went to talk to King Solomon for Adonijah. The king rose to meet her, bowed to her, and sat down on his throne. He ordered a throne be set in place for his mother. She sat on a throne to his right 
111Kg 2:20 and said to him, "I would like to make a minor request of you. Please don't refuse me." "What is your request, mother?" the king asked her. "I won't turn you down."
111Kg 2:21 So she asked him, "Give Abishag the Shunnamite to your brother Adonijah as a wife."
111Kg 2:22 But King Solomon replied to his mother, "Why are you asking Abishag the Shunnamite for Adonijah?Why not ask me to give up the kingdom for him, since he's my older brother, and why not ask for Abiathar the priest, and for Zeruiah's son Joab?"
111Kg 2:23 Then King Solomon took this oath in the name of the Lord£º "May God do so to me, and more besides, if Adonijah hasn't endangered his life by bringing up this subject. 
111Kg 2:24 Now therefore, as the Lord lives, who has established me and set me on the throne of my father David, and who has established a dynasty, just like he promised, Adonijah will surely be executed today." 
111Kg 2:25 So King Solomon sent for Jehoiada's son Benaiah, who attacked and killed Adonijah.24
111Kg 2:26 The king also told Abiathar the priest, "Go home to Anathoth. You deserve to die, but I won't kill you today, because you carried the ark of the Lord God before my father David and because you shared all the troubles that my father went through." 
111Kg 2:27 So Solomon fired Abiathar as the Lord's priest, thus fulfilling the promise that the Lord had spoken in Shiloh concerning Eli's household.
111Kg 2:28 When Joab learned what had happened, he ran to the Lord's tabernacle and grabbed hold of the horns of the altar, since Joab had supported Adonijah (though he had not supported Absalom). 
111Kg 2:29 Somebody informed King Solomon, "Joab just ran to the Lord's tabernacle and now he's standing beside the altar!" But Solomon ordered Jehoiada's son Benaiah, "Go kill him!"
111Kg 2:30 So Benaiah went into the Lord's tabernacle and told Joab, "The king orders you to come out!" "No," Joab said, "I'd rather die here!" So Benaiah went and informed the king, "This is how Joab answered me."
111Kg 2:31 The king replied to him, "Do just what he asked. Kill him and bury him so that you may remove from me and from my father's household the guilt that Joab shed needlessly. 
111Kg 2:32 The Lord will repay him for his bloodshed because, without my father David's consent he attacked and murdered two men more righteous and better than he, Ner's son Abner, the commander of Israel's army and Jether's son Amasa, commander of Judah's army. 
111Kg 2:33 May their blood be repaid to Joab and to his descendants forever, and may there be peace shown from the Lord forever to David, to his descendants, to his household, and to his throne."
111Kg 2:34 Jehoiada's son Benaiah then approached Joab, attacked him, killed him, and had him buried at Joab's home in the wilderness. 
111Kg 2:35 The king appointed Jehoiada's son Benaiah in charge of the army to replace Joab and also appointed Zadok the priest to replace Abiathar.
111Kg 2:36 The king sent for Shimei and told him, "Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and live there, but don't go anywhere from there. 
111Kg 2:37 If you ever leave and cross the Kidron Brook, you can be sure that you'll die. You'll be responsible for your own death."2
111Kg 2:38 Shimei replied to the king, "What your majesty has decreed is acceptable to me. I'll do what you've said." So Shimei lived in Jerusalem for quite some time. 
111Kg 2:39 But three years later, two of Shimei's servants escaped to Maacah's son Achish, the king of Gath. Somebody told Shimei, "Look! Your servants went to Gath!" 
111Kg 2:40 So Shimei got up, saddled a donkey, and traveled to Gath to find his servants. He found them and brought them back from Gath.
111Kg 2:41 Later, Solomon found out that Shimei had left Jerusalem, gone to Gath, and had returned, 
111Kg 2:42 so the king sent for Shimei and asked him, "Didn't I make a promise to the Lord and warn you, 'The day you leave and go anywhere else, you can be sure you'll die'?And you said to me, 'What your majesty has decreed is acceptable to me.' 
111Kg 2:43 So why haven't you kept the oath you made to the Lord, and why didn't you obey my personal order to you?"
111Kg 2:44 The king also reminded Shimei, "You know all the evil things that you admit you did to my father David. Therefore the Lord is going to repay you for all of your evil. 
111Kg 2:45 But King Solomon will be blessed, and David's throne will be established in the presence of the Lord forever." 
111Kg 2:46 So the king gave orders to Jehoiada's son Benaiah to go out, attack Shimei, and kill him. That is how the kingdom was established under Solomon's control.
111Kg 3:1 Later, Solomon intermarried with the family of Pharaoh, the king of Egypt by taking his daughter and bringing her to the city of David to live until he had completed building his own palace, the Lord's temple, and the wall around Jerusalem. 
111Kg 3:2 The people were sacrificing at various high places because the temple had not yet been built and dedicated to the Lord.
111Kg 3:3 Solomon loved the Lord, and lived according to the statutes that his father David obeyed, except that he sacrificed and burned offerings at the high places. 
111Kg 3:4 The king used to go to Gibeon to sacrifice, since there was a famous high place there, where Solomon once offered 1,000 burnt offerings on that altar. 
111Kg 3:5 The Lord appeared to Solomon one night in a dream and told him, "Ask me for whatever you want and I'll give it to you."
111Kg 3:6 So Solomon said£º "You have demonstrated abundant gracious love to your servant David, my father, as he lived in your presence truthfully, righteously, and uprightly in his heart. In addition, you have kept on showing this abundant gracious love by giving him a son to sit on his throne today. 
111Kg 3:7 Now, Lord my God, you have set me as king to replace my father David, but I'm still young. I don't have any leadership skills. 
111Kg 3:8 Your servant lives in the midst of your people that you have chosen, a great people that is too numerous to be counted. 
111Kg 3:9 So give your servant an understanding mind to govern your people, so I can discern between good and evil. Otherwise, how shall I be able to govern this great people of yours?"8
111Kg 3:10 The Lord was pleased that Solomon had asked for this, 
111Kg 3:11 so God said to him£º "Because you asked for this, and you didn't ask for a long life for yourself, and you didn't ask for the lives of your enemies, but instead you've asked for discernment so you can understand how to govern, 
111Kg 3:12 look how I'm going to do precisely what you asked. I'm giving you a wise and discerning mind, so that there will have been no one like you before you and no one will arise after you like you. 
111Kg 3:13 I'm also giving you what you haven't requested£º both riches and honor, so that no other king will be comparable to you during your lifetime. 
111Kg 3:14 If you will live life my way, keeping my statutes and my commands, just like your father David did, I'll also increase the length of your life."
111Kg 3:15 Then Solomon woke up and realized that he had dreamed a dream. Then he went back to Jerusalem, stood before the ark of the Lord's covenant, offered burnt offerings and peace offerings, and threw a party for all of his servants.
111Kg 3:16 Right about then, two prostitutes approached the king and requested an audience with him. 
111Kg 3:17 One woman said, "Your majesty, this woman and I live in the same house. I gave birth to a child while she was in the house. 
111Kg 3:18 Three days later, this woman also gave birth. We lived alone there. There was nobody else with us in the house. It was just the two of us. 
111Kg 3:19 This woman's son died overnight because she laid on top of him. 
111Kg 3:20 She got up in the middle of the night, took my son from me while your servant was asleep, and laid him to her breast after laying her dead son next to me. 
111Kg 3:21 The next morning, I got up to nurse my son, and he was dead. But when I examined him carefully in the light of day, he turned out not to be my son whom I had borne!"3
111Kg 3:22 "Not so," claimed the other woman. "The living child is my son, and the dead one is yours." But the first woman said, "Not so! The dead child is your son and the living one is my son." This is what they testified before the king.
111Kg 3:23 The king said, "One of them claims, 'This living son is mine, and your son is the dead one' and the other claims 'No. Your son is the dead one and my son is the living one.' 
111Kg 3:24 "Somebody get me a sword." So they brought a sword to the king. 
111Kg 3:25 "Divide the living child in two!" he ordered. "Give half to the one and half to the other."
111Kg 3:26 The woman whose child was still alive cried out to the king, because her heart yearned for her son. "Oh no, your majesty!" she said. "Give her the living child. Please don't kill him." But the other woman said, "Cut him in half! That way, he'll belong to neither one of us."
111Kg 3:27 The king announced his decision£º "Give the living child to the first woman. Don't kill him. She is his mother." 
111Kg 3:28 When this decision that the king had handed down was announced, everybody in Israel was amazed at the king, because they all saw that God's wisdom was in him, enabling him to administer justice.
111Kg 4:1 And so King Solomon ruled over all of Israel. 
111Kg 4:2 Here's a list of his officials£º Zadok's son Azariah was priest, 
111Kg 4:3 Shisha's sons Elihoreph and Ahijah were his secretaries, Ahilud's son Jehoshaphat was recorder, 
111Kg 4:4 Jehoiada's son Benaiah commanded the army, Zadok and Abiathar served as priests, 
111Kg 4:5 Nathan's son Azariah supervised the governors, Nathan's son Zabud the priest was the king's counselor, 
111Kg 4:6 Ahishar supervised palace matters, and Abda's son Adoniram supervised conscripted labor. 
111Kg 4:7 Solomon also appointed twelve governors over all of Israel, each of whom were responsible for providing one month's food provisions to the king and to his administration during each year.
111Kg 4:8 Here's a list of their names£º Ben-hur from the hill country of Ephraim; 
111Kg 4:9 Ben-deker in Makaz, Shaalbim and Beth-shemesh and Elonbeth-hanan; 
111Kg 4:10 Ben-hesed served in Arubboth (where he supervised Socoh and all of the territory of Hepher); 
111Kg 4:11 Ben-abinadab supervised the Dor heights (Solomon's daughter Taphath was his wife); 
111Kg 4:12 Ahilud's son Baana served Taanach, Megiddo, and all of Beth-shean near Zarethan below Jezreel, including from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah as far as the other side of Jokmeam; 
111Kg 4:13 Ben-geber in Ramoth-gilead, including the towns that belonged to Manasseh's descendant Jair that are in Gilead); 
111Kg 4:14 Iddo's son Ahinadab served in Mahanaim; 
111Kg 4:15 Ahimaaz served in Naphtali (he was married to Solomon's daughter Basemath); 
111Kg 4:16 Hushai's son Baana served in Asher and Bealoth; 
111Kg 4:17 Paruah's son Jehoshaphat served in Issachar; 
111Kg 4:18 Ela's son Shimei served in Benjamin; 
111Kg 4:19 and Uri's son Geber served in the territory of Gileon, the territory formerly ruled by King Sihon of the Amorites and King Og of Bashan (he was the only governor over that territory).
111Kg 4:20 Judah and Israel became as numerous as the sand on the seashore. They enjoyed abundance, and ate, drank, and rejoiced regularly. 
111Kg 4:21 Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates River to the territory of the Philistines and south to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon throughout his lifetime. 
111Kg 4:22 Solomon's daily provisions were 30 kors of fine flour, 60 kors of meal, 
111Kg 4:23 ten fattened oxen, 20 pasture-fed cattle, 100 sheep, as well as deer, gazelles, roebucks, and domestic poultry. 
111Kg 4:24 He ruled over everything west of the Euphrates River from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all of the kings west of the Euphrates River, and he enjoyed peace on all sides around him.21
111Kg 4:25 Judah and Israel lived safely, and everyone enjoyed their own vine and fig tree from Dan to Beersheba through all of Solomon's life. 
111Kg 4:26 Solomon owned 40,000 stalls for the horses that drove his chariots, and he employed 12,000 men to drive them. 
111Kg 4:27 His officers supplied provisions for King Solomon and for everyone who visited King Solomon's palace, each in their respective month of service responsibility. Nothing ever ran out. 
111Kg 4:28 They also provided barley and straw for the horses and camels to their respective locations, each consistent with their responsibilities.424
111Kg 4:29 God gave Solomon wisdom and great discernment. His insights were as numerous as sand on the seashore. 
111Kg 4:30 Solomon was wiser than any of the eastern leaders and wiser than anyone in Egypt. 
111Kg 4:31 He was wiser than anyone of his day - wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, Heman, and wiser than Mahol's sons Calcol and Darda. His reputation was known throughout the surrounding nations. 
111Kg 4:32 Solomon wrote 3,000 proverbs and 1,005 songs. 
111Kg 4:33 He described trees - everything from cedars that grow in Lebanon to hyssop that grows on a garden wall. He described animals, birds, reptiles, and fish. 
111Kg 4:34 People came from everywhere to hear Solomon's advice. Every king on the earth heard of his wisdom.
111Kg 5:1 King Hiram of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he learned that Solomon had been anointed king to replace his father, because Hiram had been David's lifelong friend. 
111Kg 5:2 Solomon sent this message to Hiram:
111Kg 5:3 "You know that my father David was unable to build a temple dedicated to the Lord his God because he was busy fighting wars all around him until the Lord defeated his enemies. 
111Kg 5:4 But now the Lord has given me rest all around, since I have neither foreign adversaries nor domestic crises. 
111Kg 5:5 So now I'm planning to build a temple dedicated to the Lord my God, just as the Lord told my father when he said, 'Your son, whom I will set on your throne to replace you, will build the temple dedicated to me.' 
111Kg 5:6 Now therefore please order that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. My servants will work with your servants, and I will pay your servants whatever wages you set, because you know there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians do."
111Kg 5:7 As soon as Hiram received the message from Solomon, he became so ecstatic that he exclaimed, "Blessed be the Lord today, who has given David a wise son to rule this great people!" Then he sent this message to Solomon:
111Kg 5:8 "I have read the letter that you sent me. I'll do what you've asked about the cedar and cypress timber. 
111Kg 5:9 My servants will transport them from Lebanon to the sea, where we'll make them into rafts and float them by sea to the port that you tell me to send them. We'll have them prepared for transport there and then you can carry them from there. You can meet my needs by providing provisions for my household."
111Kg 5:10 That's how Hiram came to provide Solomon as much cedar and cypress timber as he needed. 
111Kg 5:11 In return, Solomon paid Hiram 20,000 kors of wheat as food for his household, and 20 kors of beaten oil. Solomon provided this amount every year during the construction.
111Kg 5:12 The Lord continued giving Solomon wisdom, just as he had promised, and Hiram and Solomon entered into a peace treaty between themselves.
111Kg 5:13 King Solomon conscripted laborers from throughout Israel. The work force numbered 30,000 men. 
111Kg 5:14 He sent 10,000 men to Lebanon in shifts lasting one month. They worked one month in Lebanon for every two months they worked at home. Adoniram was placed in charge of the conscripted labor. 
111Kg 5:15 Solomon also employed 70,000 heavy-lift workers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country. 
111Kg 5:16 Solomon also employed 3,300 officials to supervise the work and to manage the people employed in the construction. 
111Kg 5:17 The king specified that large, expensive stones be quarried so the foundation of the temple could be laid with cut stones. 
111Kg 5:18 As a result, Solomon's builders worked with Hiram's builders, accompanied by the Gebalites, to quarry the stone and to prepare the timber and other stone for the temple's construction.
111Kg 6:1 During the month of Ziv, which was the second month of the fourth year of Solomon's reign over Israel, 480 years after the Israelites left the land of Egypt, Solomon began to build the Lord's temple. 
111Kg 6:2 The temple for the Lord that Solomon was building was 90 feet long and 30 feet wide. 
111Kg 6:3 A portico extended in front of the temple for 30 feet outward, corresponding to the width of the temple. Along the front of the temple its depth was 15 feet. 
111Kg 6:4 Solomon also constructed windows in the temple with specially designed frames.3
111Kg 6:5 Against the wall of the temple he built a series of rooms that encompassed the exterior of the temple walls around the inner sanctuary. He built these side chambers all around the building. 
111Kg 6:6 The lower structures were seven and a half feet wide, the middle structures were nine feet wide, and the third structures were ten and a half feet wide. Offsets were placed all around the temple so that beams would not protrude through the walls of the temple. 
111Kg 6:7 The temple was constructed of stone precut at the quarry so that no hammer, axe, or any other iron implement would be heard in the temple while it was being built. 
111Kg 6:8 A passageway to the side chamber was constructed on the south side of the temple by which people could ascend winding stairs to the middle story, then from there to the third story. 
111Kg 6:9 After Solomon built the temple and finished it, he covered the temple with beams and planks made of cedar. 
111Kg 6:10 He constructed this structure to adjoin the entire temple, seven and a half feet high, and fastened it to the temple with cedar timbers.
111Kg 6:11 Then this message from the Lord came to Solomon£º 
111Kg 6:12 "Concerning this temple that you're building, if you live your life according to my statutes, carry out my ordinances, and keep all of my commands, and live according to them, then I will do what I promised to your father David. 
111Kg 6:13 I will reside among the Israelites and will never abandon my people Israel."
111Kg 6:14 So Solomon kept on building the temple and finished it. 
111Kg 6:15 Then he built the inside walls of the temple, lining them from floor to ceiling with cedar boards, and overlaying the temple floor with boards made of cypress wood. 
111Kg 6:16 He lined 30 feet of the rear part of the temple from floor to ceiling with cedar boards specially constructed for the inside to serve as the most holy place. 
111Kg 6:17 The rest of the main nave in the front was 60 feet long. 
111Kg 6:18 Cedar carvings in the form of gourds and blooming flowers covered the entire interior of the temple so that no stone could be seen.
111Kg 6:19 Solomon also prepared an inner sanctuary within the temple where the Lord's ark of the covenant was placed. 
111Kg 6:20 The inner sanctuary was 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 30 feet high, and overlaid with pure gold. The altar was also overlaid with cedar. 
111Kg 6:21 Solomon overlaid the inside of the temple with pure gold, fastened gold chains across the front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold. 
111Kg 6:22 He finished the temple by overlaying it entirely with gold, including overlaying with gold the whole altar that was by the inner sanctuary. 
111Kg 6:23 Inside the inner sanctuary Solomon placed two cherubim from olive wood, each fifteen feet high. 
111Kg 6:24 Each wing of one cherub was seven and a half feet long, and each wing of the other cherub was seven and a half feet long, so that the distance from the end of one wing to the end of the other wing was fifteen feet. 
111Kg 6:25 Each cherub was fifteen feet high, and both were of the same size and shape. 
111Kg 6:26 The height of one cherub being fifteen feet, as was the height of the other.
111Kg 6:27 Solomon placed the cherubim in the middle of the inner sanctuary, with their wings spread in such a way that the wing of one was touching the one wall and the opposite wing of the other cherub was touching the opposite wall. Furthermore, their wings in the center of the wall were touching each other wing-to-wing. 
111Kg 6:28 Each cherub was overlaid with gold.
111Kg 6:29 Solomon also inlaid all the inner walls of the temple - both the inner and outer sanctuaries - with carved engravings of cherubim, palm trees, blooming flowers. 
111Kg 6:30 He also overlaid the floor of the temple with gold in both the inner and outer sanctuaries.6
111Kg 6:31 Solomon also provided doors, lintels, and five-sided doorposts for the entrance to the inner sanctuary. 
111Kg 6:32 He installed two doors made of olive wood, inlaying them with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and blooming flowers, and overlaying them with gold. Then he added more gold to cover the cherubim and palm trees.31
111Kg 6:33 Solomon also provided four-sided doorposts made of cypress wood for the entrance to the outer sanctuary, 
111Kg 6:34 along with two doors of cypress wood, one door of which had two leaves that turned on hinges, as did the other door, which also had two leaves that turned on hinges.6
111Kg 6:35 Solomon also inlaid the doors with cherubim, palm trees, and blooming flowers. He overlaid them with gold that was carefully applied on the engraved work. 
111Kg 6:36 He constructed the inner court with three rows of precut stone and a row of cedar beams.
111Kg 6:37 The foundation for the Lord's temple was laid in the month of Ziv during the fourth year of Solomon's reign, 
111Kg 6:38 and the temple was completely finished according to its plans and specifications in the eleventh month of the eighth year of Solomon's reign, that is, during the month of Bul. It took about seven years to build.
111Kg 7:1 But Solomon took thirteen years to build his own palace, and finally finished it. 
111Kg 7:2 He built his own palace out of timber supplied from the forest of Lebanon. It was 150 feet long, 75 feet wide, and 45 feet tall, and was constructed on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams interlocking the pillars. 
111Kg 7:3 There were 45 pillars paneled with cedar above the side chambers, with rows of fifteen pillars, 
111Kg 7:4 with three rows of framed windows facing each other in three rows. 
111Kg 7:5 All the doorways and doorposts had rectangular frames, with the doorways facing each other in three tiers. 
111Kg 7:6 There was also a hall of pillars 75 feet long and 45 feet wide, and a porch in front with pillars, and a canopy in front of the pillars. 
111Kg 7:7 He constructed the Judgment Hall for the throneroom where he would be ruling, paneling it with cedar from floor to ceiling. 
111Kg 7:8 Solomon's personal dwelling quarters, a separate court behind the hall, was of similar workmanship. Solomon also built a house similar to this for Pharaoh's daughter, whom Solomon had married.
111Kg 7:9 All of these were made with expensive stones, pre-cut according to specifications, hand-sawed inside and out from the foundation to the coping, including from inside to the great court. 
111Kg 7:10 The foundation was made of expensive stone, including large stones fifteen feet long and stones twelve feet long. 
111Kg 7:11 Above these were expensive stones cut according to specifications, and cedar. 
111Kg 7:12 So the great court was surrounded by three rows of cut stone, along with a row of cedar beams, just like the inner court of the Lord's temple and the porch surrounding the temple.10
111Kg 7:13 King Solomon sent for Hiram from Tyre, 
111Kg 7:14 the son of a widow from the tribe of Naphtali, whose father was from Tyre. A bronze worker, he was wise, knowledgeable, and was skilled in all sorts of bronze working. He went to King Solomon and did all of his work.
111Kg 7:15 He fashioned two bronze pillars, each one 27 feet high, with a circumference of 18 feet. 
111Kg 7:16 He also crafted two capitals of cast bronze and set them on top of the pillars. The height of one capital was seven and a half feet, and the height of the other capital was seven and a half feet. 
111Kg 7:17 A network of latticework on top of the pillars was inlaid with ornamental wreaths and chains, the top of each pillar containing seven groups of ornamental structures. 
111Kg 7:18 The pillars contained two rows of ornaments shaped like pomegranates around the latticework covering the top of each pillar. 
111Kg 7:19 The capitals on top of each pillar above the rounded latticework contained six feet of lily designs, 
111Kg 7:20 with the capitals on the two pillars covered by 200 pomegranates in rows around both the capitals above and adjoining the rounded latticework. 
111Kg 7:21 That's how he designed the pillars at the portico of the sanctuary. When he set up the right pillar, he named it Jachin. When he set up the left pillar, he named it Boaz. 
111Kg 7:22 The work on the pillars was finished with a lily design on top of the pillars.
111Kg 7:23 Hiram also made a sea of cast metal fifteen feet from brim to brim, circular in shape and seven and a half feet high and 45 feet in its inner circumference. 
111Kg 7:24 Under the brim, completely encircling it, were two rows of gourds inlaid as part of the original casting, ten for each one and a half feet. 
111Kg 7:25 The sea stood on top of twelve oxen. Three faced north, three faced west, three faced south, and three faced east. The sea was set on top of them, and their hind parts faced the center. 
111Kg 7:26 The reservoir, which held about 12,000 gallons, stood about three inches thick, and its rim looked like the brim of a cup or of a lily blossom.24
111Kg 7:27 Hiram also made ten bronze water carts. Each one was six feet wide, six feet long, and four and a half feet high. 
111Kg 7:28 The carts were designed with borders between cross-pieces, 
111Kg 7:29 and on the borders between the cross-pieces were lions, oxen, and cherubim. A pedestal was placed above the cross-pieces, and beneath the lions and oxen there were wreaths hanging down. 
111Kg 7:30 Each cart had four bronze wheels equipped with bronze axles with four support feet. Beneath the basin were cast support structures made like wreaths on each side. 
111Kg 7:31 The opening to each water cart inside the crown on top was one and a half feet wide, with engravings on the opening. The borders to the frames surrounding the opening were square, not round. 
111Kg 7:32 The four wheels were placed underneath the borders, and the axles for the wheels were on the stand. Each wheel stood 27 inches high. 
111Kg 7:33 The wheels resembled those of a chariot, with their axles, rims, spokes, and hubs made of cast bronze. 
111Kg 7:34 Four supports stood at the four corners of each cart, built into the carts themselves. 
111Kg 7:35 On top of each stand was a circular structure nine inches high, with its braces and support frames integral with it, forming a single piece. 
111Kg 7:36 Hiram engraved ornamental cherubim, lions, and palm trees on the surfaces of the supports and frames wherever there was space to do so, and encircled the artwork with wreaths. 
111Kg 7:37 He made ten identical water carts by using the same plans, castings, and shapes for all of them.34
111Kg 7:38 Hiram also fashioned ten bronze basins, each holding about 240 gallons, each basin measuring 6 feet in diameter, with one basin for each stand. 
111Kg 7:39 He set five of the stands on the right side of the temple and five on the left side of the temple. He set the bronze sea on the right side of the temple eastward facing the south. 
111Kg 7:40 Hiram also made the basins, shovels, and bowls to complete the work that he performed for King Solomon in the Lord's temple, 
111Kg 7:41 including the two pillars and the bowls for the capitals that stood on top of the two pillars, along with the two lattices that covered the two bowls of the capitals that stood on top of the pillars, 
111Kg 7:42 plus the 400 pomegranates for the two lattices (that is, the two rows of pomegranates for each lattice to cover the two bowls of the capitals that stood on top of the pillars), 
111Kg 7:43 the ten stands with the ten basins on the stands, 
111Kg 7:44 the single bronze sea and the twelve oxen that stood under the sea, 
111Kg 7:45 and the pots, shovels, and bowls - all of these utensils that Hiram made for King Solomon for the Lord's temple were made from polished bronze.
111Kg 7:46 The king had them cast in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan in the Jordan plain. 
111Kg 7:47 Solomon never inventoried the weight of the bronze used, because there were too many utensils, so the weight of the bronze used was never ascertained. 
111Kg 7:48 Solomon made all the furnishings that were placed in the Lord's temple, including the golden altar and the golden table on which the bread of the Presence was placed, 
111Kg 7:49 along with the lamp stands (five on the right side and five on the left in front of the inner sanctuary), all made of pure gold, as well as the flower blossoms, lamps, and tongs of gold, 
111Kg 7:50 and the cups, snuffers, bowls, spoons, and the fire pans, all made of pure gold, and hinges for the doors of the inner sanctuary, the most holy place, and for the gates of the temple that led to the nave, also of gold.
111Kg 7:51 Thus all the work that King Solomon performed in the Lord's temple was finished. Then Solomon brought in the articles that had been dedicated by his father David, including silver, gold, and other utensils, and he placed them into storage in the treasuries of the Lord's temple.
111Kg 8:1 Then Solomon gathered together the elders of Israel, including all the heads of the tribes and the leaders of the ancestral households of the Israelites, to meet with him in Jerusalem so they could bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Zion, the city of David. 
111Kg 8:2 So all the men gathered together to meet with King Solomon at the Feast of Booths in the month Ethanim, the seventh month. 
111Kg 8:3 All the Elders of Israel showed up, and the priests picked up the ark 
111Kg 8:4 and brought it, the Tent of Meeting, and all the holy implements that were in the tent . The priests and Levites carried them up to Jerusalem.
111Kg 8:5 King Solomon and the entire congregation of Israel that had assembled to be with him stood in front of the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they were neither counted nor inventoried. 
111Kg 8:6 After this, the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord to the place prepared for it, into the inner sanctuary of the temple, under the wings of the cherubim in the most holy place. 
111Kg 8:7 The wings of the cherubim spread over the resting place for the ark, so that the cherubim made a covering over the ark and its poles when viewed from above. 
111Kg 8:8 The poles extended so far that their ends could be seen from the holy place in front of the inner sanctuary, but they could not be seen from outside. They remain there to this day. 
111Kg 8:9 The ark was empty except for the two stone tablets that Moses had placed there at Horeb when the Lord had made a covenant with the Israelites after they had come out of the land of Egypt. 
111Kg 8:10 When the priests left the holy place after setting the ark in place, the cloud filled the Lord's temple 
111Kg 8:11 so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, since the glory of the Lord filled the Lord's temple.5
111Kg 8:12 Then Solomon said, "The Lord has said that he lives shrouded in darkness. 
111Kg 8:13 Now I have been constructing a magnificent temple dedicated to you that will serve as a place for you to inhabit forever."
111Kg 8:14 Then the king turned to face the entire congregation of Israel while the congregation of Israel remained standing. 
111Kg 8:15 Then Solomon prayed£º "Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, who made a commitment to my father David and then personally fulfilled what he had promised when he said:
111Kg 8:16 'From the day I brought out my people Israel from Egypt I never chose a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a temple where my name might reside. I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.'
111Kg 8:17 "My father David wanted to build a temple for the name of the Lord God of Israel. 
111Kg 8:18 The Lord said to my father David£º 'Therefore, since you determined to build a temple for my name, you acted well, because it was your choice to do so. 
111Kg 8:19 Nevertheless, you are not to build the temple, but your son who will be born to you is to build a temple for my name.'
111Kg 8:20 "The Lord has brought to fulfillment what he promised, and now here I stand, having succeeded my father David to sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised. I have built the temple for the name of the Lord God of Israel. 
111Kg 8:21 I have placed there the ark in which the covenant is stored that the Lord made with our ancestors when he brought them out of the land of Egypt."
111Kg 8:22 Then Solomon took his place in front of the Lord's altar in the presence of the entire congregation of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven, 
111Kg 8:23 and said£º "Lord God of Israel, there is no one like you, God in heaven above or on the earth below, who watches over his covenant, showing gracious love to your servants who live their lives in your presence with all their hearts. 
111Kg 8:24 It is you, Lord God, who have kept your promise to my father, your servant David, that you made to him. Indeed, you made a commitment to my father David and then personally fulfilled what you had promised today.
111Kg 8:25 "Now therefore, Lord God of Israel, keep your promise that you made to my father, your servant David, when you said, 'You will not lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants will watch their lives, to live in my presence just as you have lived in my presence.' 
111Kg 8:26 "Now therefore, God of Israel, may your promise that you made to your servant David my father be fulfilled¡¦ 
111Kg 8:27 and yet, will God truly reside on earth?Look! Neither the sky nor the highest heaven can contain you! How much less this temple that I have built! 
111Kg 8:28 Pay attention to the prayer of your servant and to his request, Lord my God, and listen to the cry and prayer that your servant is praying in your presence today. 
111Kg 8:29 Let your eyes always look toward this temple night and day, toward the location where you have said 'My name will reside there.' Listen to the prayer that your servant prays in this direction. 
111Kg 8:30 Listen to the requests from your servant and from your people Israel as they pray in this direction, listen from the place where you reside in heaven, then hear and forgive.
111Kg 8:31 "If a man should sin against his neighbor and he is required to take an oath, and he then comes to take an oath in front of your altar in this temple, 
111Kg 8:32 then listen in heaven, act, and judge your servants, condemning the wicked by bringing back to him the consequences of his choices and by justifying the righteous by recompensing him according to his righteousness.
111Kg 8:33 "If your people Israel are defeated in a battle with their enemy because they have sinned against you, when they return to you and confess to you, pray, and in this temple they ask you to show grace to them, 
111Kg 8:34 then hear in heaven, forgive the sin of your people Israel, and return them to the soil that you gave to their ancestors.
111Kg 8:35 "When heaven remains closed, and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, and they pray in the direction of this place, confessing your name and turning from their sin when you afflict them, 
111Kg 8:36 then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants and of your people Israel. Indeed, teach them the best way to live and send rain on your land that you have given to your people as an inheritance.
111Kg 8:37 "If a famine comes to the land, or if plant diseases, mildew, locust, or grasshoppers appear, or if their enemies attack them in their settlements of the land, no matter what the epidemic or illness is, 
111Kg 8:38 whatever prayer or request is made, no matter whether it's made by a single man or by all of your people Israel, each praying out of his own hurting heart and anguish and stretching out his hands toward this temple, 
111Kg 8:39 then hear from heaven, the place where you reside, and forgive, repaying each person according to all of his ways, since you know their hearts - for you alone know the hearts of all human beings?
111Kg 8:40 so they will fear you every day and live on the surface of the land that you have given to our ancestors.
111Kg 8:41 "Now concerning the foreigner who is not from your people Israel, when he comes from a land far away for the sake of your name 
111Kg 8:42 (for people will hear of your great name, your mighty acts, and your obvious power), when he comes and prays facing this temple, 
111Kg 8:43 then hear in heaven where you reside, and do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the people of the earth may know your name, fear you as do your people Israel, and so they may know that this temple that I have built is called by your name.
111Kg 8:44 "When your people go out to war against their enemies, no matter what way you send them, and they pray to the Lord in the direction of the city that you have chosen and in the direction of the temple that I have built for your name, 
111Kg 8:45 then hear their prayer and their request in heaven, and fight for their cause.
111Kg 8:46 "When they sin against you - because there isn't a single human being who doesn't sin - and you become angry with them and deliver them over to their enemy, who takes them away captive to the land that belongs to their enemy, whether near or far away, 
111Kg 8:47 if they turn their hearts back to you in the land where they have been taken captive, repent, and pray to you - even if they do so in the land of their captivity - confessing, 'We have sinned, we have committed abominations, and practiced wickedness,' 
111Kg 8:48 if they return to you with all of their heart and with all of their soul in the land of their enemies who have taken them captive, as they pray to you in the direction of their land that you have given to their ancestors and to the city that you have chosen, and to the temple that I have built for your name, 
111Kg 8:49 then hear their prayer and requests in heaven, where you reside, and fight for their cause, 
111Kg 8:50 forgiving your people who have sinned against you, along with their transgressions by which they have transgressed against you.4"S how your compassion in the presence of those who have taken them captive, so they may show compassion on them, 
111Kg 8:51 since they are your people and your heritage, which you brought out of Egypt, from an iron fire furnace. 
111Kg 8:52 Do this so your eyes may remain open to the requests of your servant and to the requests of your people's prayers, to listen to them whenever they call out to you, 
111Kg 8:53 because you have separated them to yourself as your heritage from all the people of the earth, as you spoke through your servant Moses when you brought our ancestors out of Egypt, Lord God.
111Kg 8:54 When Solomon had completed saying this entire prayer to the Lord, he got up from kneeling with his hands spread out toward heaven in the presence of the Lord's altar, 
111Kg 8:55 stood up, and blessed all of the assembly of Israel in a loud voice. He said:
111Kg 8:56 "Blessed is the Lord, who has given security to his people Israel, just as he promised. Not one of his promises has failed to come about that he gave through his servant Moses. 
111Kg 8:57 May the Lord our God be with us, just as he was with our ancestors. May he never leave us or abandon us, 
111Kg 8:58 so that he may turn our hearts toward him, so that we may live life his way, keeping his commands, statutes, and ordinances that he gave to our ancestors. 
111Kg 8:59 And may what I've had to say to the Lord remain with the Lord our God both day and night, so that he may defend the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel, as the need of the day may require it, 
111Kg 8:60 so that, in turn, all the people of the earth may know that the Lord is God - there is no one else. 
111Kg 8:61 Now let your heart be completely devoted to the Lord our God, to live according to his statutes and to keep his commands, as we are doing today."856
111Kg 8:62 Then the king and all of Israel with him offered sacrifices to the Lord. 
111Kg 8:63 Solomon offered peace offerings to the Lord consisting of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the Israelites dedicated the Lord's temple. 
111Kg 8:64 That same day, the king consecrated the middle court that stood in front of the Lord's temple, because that was where he offered burnt offerings, grain offerings, and fat from the peace offerings and because the bronze altar that was in the Lord's presence was too small to hold the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and fat from the peace offerings. 
111Kg 8:65 So Solomon observed the Feast of Booths at that time, as did all of Israel with him. A large assembly came up from as far away as Lebo-hamath and the Wadi of Egypt to appear in the presence of the Lord our God, not just for seven days, but for seven days after that, a total of fourteen days. 
111Kg 8:66 The following day, Solomon sent the people away as they blessed the king. Then they went back to their tents, rejoicing and glad for all the good things that the Lord had done for his servant David and to his people Israel.
111Kg 9:1 Later, after Solomon had finished building the Lord's temple, the royal palace, and everything else that Solomon wanted to do, 
111Kg 9:2 the Lord appeared to Solomon for a second time, just as he had appeared to him at Gibeon. 
111Kg 9:3 The Lord said to him£º "I've heard your prayer and your request that you made to me. I have consecrated this temple that you have built by placing my name there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there continually.
111Kg 9:4 "Now as for you, if you commune with me like your father did, with an upright heart of integrity and doing everything that I've commanded you and keeping my statutes and ordinances, 
111Kg 9:5 then I'll make your royal throne secure forever, just as I agreed to do so for your father David when I said, 'You are to not lack a man on the throne of Israel.' 
111Kg 9:6 But if you or your descendants abandon me, and do not keep my commandments and statutes that I have given to you, and if you go away, serve other gods, and worship them, 
111Kg 9:7 then I will eliminate Israel from the land that I gave them and from the temple that I've consecrated for my name. I will throw them out of my sight, and Israel will become the butt of jokes and a means of ridicule among people worldwide!
111Kg 9:8 "This temple will become a pile of ruins. Everyone who passes by it will be so astounded that they will ask, 'Why did the Lord do this to this land and to this temple?' 
111Kg 9:9 They will answer, 'Because they abandoned the Lord their God, who brought their ancestors out of the land of Egypt, and they adopted other gods and served them. That's why the Lord has brought all of this disaster on them.'"
111Kg 9:10 It took 20 years for Solomon to finish working on the two houses - the Lord's temple and the royal palace?
111Kg 9:11 after which King Solomon gave Hiram 20 cities in the land of Galilee, because King Hiram of Tyre had provided Solomon with as much cedar, cypress timber, and gold that he wanted. 
111Kg 9:12 Hiram came out from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, but he wasn't happy with them, 
111Kg 9:13 so he asked him, "What are these cities that you have given to me, my brother?" That's why these cities were named "the land of Cabal" to this day. 
111Kg 9:14 Then Hiram paid the king 9,000 pounds of gold.
111Kg 9:15 Here is a summary of the conscripted labor that King Solomon required to build the Lord's temple, his royal palace, the terrace ramparts in the city of David, the wall of Jerusalem, Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer. 
111Kg 9:16 Pharaoh, the king of Egypt, had attacked and captured Gezer, burned it down, killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and then gave it as a dowry for his daughter, Solomon's wife. 
111Kg 9:17 So Solomon rebuilt Gezer, lower Beth-horon, 
111Kg 9:18 Baalath, and Tamar in the wilderness, 
111Kg 9:19 along with the storage cities that Solomon used for his chariots and for his cavalry, everything that Solomon felt like building in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in every territory under his control.16
111Kg 9:20 The people who survived from the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not related to the Israelites, 
111Kg 9:21 and whose descendants had survived them and continued to live in the land because the Israelites were unable to completely eliminate them, Solomon placed under conscripted labor, a situation that remains in effect to this day. 
111Kg 9:22 However, Solomon did not force Israelites into conscripted labor, but they did serve as his soldiers, servants, princes, captains, chariot commanders, and cavalry. 
111Kg 9:23 There were 550 chief officers who supervised Solomon's activities and managed the staff that was doing the work.
111Kg 9:24 As soon as Pharaoh's daughter arrived from the city of David to live in her house that Solomon had built for her, then he fortified the terrace ramparts in the city of David. 
111Kg 9:25 Three times every year Solomon offered burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar that he had built to the Lord, burning incense with the offerings in the presence of the Lord. This concludes the record of the temple construction.
111Kg 9:26 King Solomon also built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Reed Sea in the land of Edom. 
111Kg 9:27 Hiram sent his servants to sail with the fleet, since they were expert seamen, and so they accompanied Solomon's servants. 
111Kg 9:28 They sailed as far as Ophir and brought back 31,500 pounds of gold for Solomon.
111Kg 10:1 When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon's reputation with the Lord, she came to test him with difficult questions. 
111Kg 10:2 She brought along a large retinue, camels laden with spices, and lots of gold and precious stones. Upon her arrival, she spoke with Solomon about everything that was on her mind. 
111Kg 10:3 Solomon answered all of her questions. Nothing was hidden from Solomon that he did not explain to her. 
111Kg 10:4 When the queen of Sheba had seen all of Solomon's wisdom for herself, the palace that he had built, 
111Kg 10:5 the food set at his table, his servants who sat with him, his ministers in attendance and how they were dressed, his personal staff and how they were dressed, and even his personal stairway by which he went up to the Lord's temple, she was breathless!
111Kg 10:6 "Everything I heard about your wisdom and what you have to say is true!" she gasped, 
111Kg 10:7 "but I didn't believe it at first! But then I came here and I've seen it for myself! It's amazing! I wasn't told half of what's really great about your wisdom. You're far better in person than what the reports have said about you! 
111Kg 10:8 How blessed are your staff! And how blessed are your employees who serve you continuously and get to listen to your wisdom! 
111Kg 10:9 Blessed be the Lord your God, who is delighted with you! He set you in place on the throne of Israel because the Lord loved Israel forever. That's why he made you to be king, so you could carry out justice and implement righteousness."
111Kg 10:10 Then she gave the king 9,000 pounds of gold, a vast quantity of spices, and precious stones. No spices ever came again that were comparable to those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. 
111Kg 10:11 Hiram's ships that brought gold from Ophir, also brought from Ophir lots of algum wood and precious stones. 
111Kg 10:12 The king used the algum wood to have supports made for the Lord's temple and for the royal palace, as well as lyres and harps for the choir, and nothing like that wood has ever come again or even been seen since right to this day. 
111Kg 10:13 In return, King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she wanted and had requested in addition to what he had given her consistent with his generosity. Afterward, she returned to her own land with her servants.
111Kg 10:14 Solomon received annually about 49,950 pounds of gold, 
111Kg 10:15 not including revenue from traders, merchants, and from all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the land. 
111Kg 10:16 King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold, overlaying each large shield with the gold from 600 gold pieces, 
111Kg 10:17 and 300 shields from beaten gold, overlaying each shield with the gold from 300 gold pieces. The king put them in his palace in the Lebanon forest. 
111Kg 10:18 The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold. 
111Kg 10:19 Six steps led up to the throne, which had a round canopy fastened to the rear of the throne and armrests on each side of the seat and two lions standing on either side of each armrest. 
111Kg 10:20 Twelve lions were placed on both sides of the six steps leading to the throne, and nothing comparable was made for any other kingdoms. 
111Kg 10:21 All of King Solomon's drinking vessels were made of gold, and all the vessels in his palace in the Lebanon forest were made of pure gold. None were of silver, because silver was never considered to be valuable during Solomon's lifetime, 
111Kg 10:22 because the king had ships that sailed to Tarshish accompanied by Hiram's ships. Once every three years ships from Tarshish returned, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. 
111Kg 10:23 As a result, King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in regards to wealth and wisdom. 
111Kg 10:24 All the earth continued to seek audiences with Solomon so they could hear the wise things that God had put in his heart. 
111Kg 10:25 Everyone kept on bringing gifts on an annual basis, including items made of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules. 
111Kg 10:26 Solomon accumulated chariots and cavalry. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 cavalry soldiers. He stationed them in various chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
111Kg 10:27 The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and made cedar trees as abundant as sycamore trees in the Shephelah. 
111Kg 10:28 Solomon imported horses from Egypt and Kue, and the king's buyers procured them at market price from Kue. 
111Kg 10:29 A chariot from Egypt cost 600 pieces of silver, and a horse 150 pieces of silver, but then they were exported to all the Hittite kings and to the Aramean kings.1015
111Kg 11:1 But King Solomon married many foreign women besides the daughter of Pharaoh£º women from Moab, Ammon, Edom, and Sidonia, along with Hittite women, too, 
111Kg 11:2 all of them from nations that the Lord had ordered the Israelites, "You are not to associate with them and they are not to associate with you, because they will most certainly turn your affections away to follow their gods." Solomon became deeply attached to them by falling in love. 
111Kg 11:3 He had 700 princess wives and 300 mistresses who turned his heart away from the Lord, 
111Kg 11:4 because as Solomon grew older, his wives turned his affections away after other gods, and his heart was not fully as devoted to the Lord his God as his father David's heart had been. 
111Kg 11:5 Solomon pursued Astarte, the Sidonian goddess, and Milcom, that detestable Ammonite idol. 
111Kg 11:6 Solomon practiced what the Lord considered to be evil by not fully following the Lord, as had his father David. 
111Kg 11:7 Later, Solomon even constructed a high place on the mountain east of Jerusalem that was dedicated to Chemosh, that detestable Moabite idol, and to Molech, the detestable Ammonite idol. 
111Kg 11:8 Solomon did this for all of his foreign wives, who burned incense and sacrificed to their own gods.
111Kg 11:9 The Lord became angry at Solomon because his heart wandered away from the Lord God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice 
111Kg 11:10 and warned him about this so he would not pursue other gods. But he did not obey what the Lord had commanded, 
111Kg 11:11 so the Lord told Solomon, "Because you have done this and haven't kept my covenant and statutes that I commanded you, I'm going to tear the kingdom from you and give it to your servant. 
111Kg 11:12 I'm not going to do this during your lifetime, for the sake of your father David, but I will tear it out of your son's control. 
111Kg 11:13 For the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, I won't tear away the entire kingdom. I'll leave one tribe for your son to govern."
111Kg 11:14 After this, the Lord allowed Hadad the Edomite to oppose Solomon. He was part of the royal line of Edom. 
111Kg 11:15 During David's military campaign against Edom, when his army commander Joab had gone out to bury the dead, he killed every male in Edom. 
111Kg 11:16 Joab had his entire army of Israel stay there for six months until he had eliminated every male in Edom.
111Kg 11:17 But Hadad escaped to Egypt in the company of some of his father's Edomite servants, while Hadad was still a little child. 
111Kg 11:18 They left Midian, arrived in Paran, and left from Paran with some men and traveled on to Egypt, where Pharaoh, king of Egypt, gave him a house to live in, assigned a food allotment to him, and gave him some land. 
111Kg 11:19 Hadad won the affection of the Pharaoh, who gave permission for Hadad to marry the sister of his own wife, Queen Tahpenes. 
111Kg 11:20 Queen Tahpenes' sister bore him his son Genubath, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh's palace while Genubath lived in Pharaoh's palace with the Pharaoh's own sons.19
111Kg 11:21 Later on, Hadad learned in Egypt that David had been buried with his ancestors and that Joab the army commander was dead. So Hadad asked Pharaoh, "Please send me out so I can go back to my own land."
111Kg 11:22 Pharaoh asked him, "But have you lacked anything from me that would make you want to go back to your own country?" "No," he answered, "but I still really must leave."
111Kg 11:23 God also raised up Eliada's son Rezon, who had escaped from his master King Hadadezer of Zobah. 
111Kg 11:24 He raised an army and commanded a gang of raiders after David had eliminated those who lived in Zobah. Rezon and his army moved to Damascus, remained there, and Rezon ruled from Damascus. 
111Kg 11:25 He opposed Israel during Solomon's entire reign, in addition to all of the evil things that Hadad did. Rezon also hated Israel while he reigned over Aram.
111Kg 11:26 Solomon had a servant, Nebat's son Jeroboam, who was an Ephraimite from Zeredah. His widowed mother was named Zeruah. Jeroboam rebelled against Solomon, 
111Kg 11:27 and this is why he rose in rebellion against the king£º Solomon had built up the terrace ramparts in the city of his father David in order to repair a weakness. 
111Kg 11:28 Jeroboam was a valiant soldier, and because Solomon observed that the young man was able to get things done, he set him in charge over all of the conscripted labor from the household of Joseph. 
111Kg 11:29 During that time, Jeroboam left Jerusalem and the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite met him on the road. Ahijah had wrapped himself up in a new cloak, and both of them were alone on the open road. 
111Kg 11:30 Ahijah grabbed the new cloak that he was wearing and tore it into twelve pieces! 
111Kg 11:31 Then he told Jeroboam, "Take ten pieces for yourself, because this is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'Pay attention! I'm going to tear the kingdom out of Solomon's control and give you ten tribes. 
111Kg 11:32 I'll leave him one tribe for the sake of my servant David and one tribe for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I chose from all of the tribes of Israel. 
111Kg 11:33 I'm doing this because they have abandoned me and worshipped that Sidonian goddess Astarte, the Moabite god Chemosh, and the Ammonite god Milcom. They haven't lived my way by doing what I consider to be right and observing my statutes and my ordinances, like his father David did.
111Kg 11:34 'Nevertheless, I won't take the entire kingdom away from him, but I'll let him reign for the rest of his life, because of my servant David, whom I chose, who obeyed my commandments and statutes, 
111Kg 11:35 but I will take the kingdom away from his son's control and give ten tribes to you. 
111Kg 11:36 I'll give one tribe to his son, so my servant David will always have a light shining in my presence in Jerusalem, the city that I chose for myself and where I have placed my name. 
111Kg 11:37 I'm going to take you and have you reign over whatever you desire. You will be king over Israel. 
111Kg 11:38 If you listen to everything that I command you to do, and if you live your life my way, and if you do what I consider to be right by observing my statutes and my commandments, just like my servant David did, then I will be with you, I will build an enduring dynasty for you, just like I did for David, and I'll give Israel to you. 
111Kg 11:39 This is how I'm going to afflict David's descendants because of what they have done, though I won't do it continuously.'"
111Kg 11:40 That's why Solomon tried to execute Jeroboam, but Jeroboam got up and fled to Egypt, where he lived as a guest of King Shishak and remained until Solomon had died.11
111Kg 11:41 Now the rest of Solomon's accomplishments, including everything else he did, as well as records of his wisdom, are recorded in the Book of the Acts of Solomon, are they not?
111Kg 11:42 Solomon reigned over all of Israel from Jerusalem for a total of 40 years. 
111Kg 11:43 Then Solomon died, as had his ancestors, and he was buried in the city of his father David. His son Rehoboam reigned in his place.
111Kg 12:1 Rehoboam traveled to Shechem because all of Israel went there to install him as king. 
111Kg 12:2 Nebat's son Jeroboam heard about it while he was still in Egypt, where he had fled to get away from King Solomon. Jeroboam returned from Egypt 
111Kg 12:3 after being summoned. When Jeroboam and the entire assembly of Israel arrived, they spoke to Rehoboam, 
111Kg 12:4 "Your father made our burdens unbearable. Therefore lighten your father's requirements and his heavy burdens that he placed on us, and we'll serve you."
111Kg 12:5 "Come again in three days," Rehoboam said to them. So the people left 
111Kg 12:6 while King Rehoboam conferred with his advisors who had worked for his father Solomon during his administration. He asked them, "What is your advice as to how I should respond to these people?"
111Kg 12:7 They advised him, "If today you are a servant, you will serve this people by answering them and speaking kindly to them. Then they will serve you forever."
111Kg 12:8 But Rehoboam ignored the counsel that his elder advisors had given him. Instead, he consulted the younger men who had grown up with him and who worked for him. 
111Kg 12:9 As a result, he asked them, "What's your advice so that we can give an answer to these people who have asked me, 'Please lighten the burden that your father put on us.'?"
111Kg 12:10 "This is what you should tell these people who asked you 'Your father made our burden heavy, but you must make it lighter for us!'" the young men who grew up with Rehoboam replied. "Tell them, 'My little finger will be thicker than my father's whole body! 
111Kg 12:11 Not only that, but since my father loaded you down heavily, I'm going to add to that burden. If my father disciplined you with whips, but I'm going to discipline you with scorpions!'"
111Kg 12:12 So Jeroboam and all the people went back to Rehoboam on the third day, just as they had been directed when the king said, "Come back again in three days." 
111Kg 12:13 But the king gave the people a harsh response, because he was ignoring the counsel that his elders had given him. 
111Kg 12:14 Instead, Rehoboam spoke to them along the lines of what the younger men suggested. He told them "My father burdened you heavily, but I will add to that burden. If my father disciplined you with whips, I'm going to discipline you with scorpions!"
111Kg 12:15 The king would not listen to the people, because the turn of events was from the Lord, to fulfill his prediction that the Lord spoke by means of  Ahijah the Shilonite to Nebat's son Jeroboam 
111Kg 12:16 When all of Israel saw that the king wasn't listening to them, the people responded to the king's message, "What's the point in following David?We have no inheritance in the descendants of Jesse. Let's go home, Israel! David, take care of your own household!' So Israel left for home. 
111Kg 12:17 And so Rehoboam ruled over the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.
111Kg 12:18 King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of conscripted labor, but all of Israel stoned him to death, and King Rehoboam had to jump in his chariot and flee back in a hurry to Jerusalem. 
111Kg 12:19 That's how Israel came to be in rebellion against David's dynasty to this day.
111Kg 12:20 Now when all of Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent for him and invited him to visit their assembly, where they installed him as king over all of Israel. Nobody (with the sole exception of the tribe of Judah) would align with David's dynasty. 
111Kg 12:21 As soon as Rehoboam returned to Jerusalem, he assembled 180,000 elite soldiers from the tribes of Judah and Benjamin, intending to attack the dynasty of Israel and restore the kingdom to Solomon's son Rehoboam. 
111Kg 12:22 But a message from God came to Shemaiah, a man of God£º 
111Kg 12:23 "Tell Solomon's son Rehoboam, king of Judah, all the dynasty of Judah, Benjamin, and the rest of the people, 
111Kg 12:24 'This is what the Lord says£º "You are not to fight or even approach your fellow Israelites in battle. Every soldier is to return to his own home, because this development comes from me."'" So they listened to what the Lord had to say and returned home, just as the Lord had directed.1220
111Kg 12:25 Later on, Jeroboam fortified Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. He also expanded from there and built Penuel. 
111Kg 12:26 Jeroboam was thinking to himself, "The kingdom is about to return to David's control. 
111Kg 12:27 If these people keep going up to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices to the Lord there, the hearts of these people will return to their lord, King Rehoboam of Judah. Then they'll kill me and return to Rehoboam, king of Judah!" 
111Kg 12:28 So the king sought some advice and then build two golden calves and announced, "It's too difficult for you to travel to Jerusalem. So here are your gods, Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!" 
111Kg 12:29 He set one of them in Bethel and placed the other one in Dan. 
111Kg 12:30 Doing this was sinful, because the people traveled as far as Dan to appear before one of their idols. 
111Kg 12:31 Jeroboam built temples on the high places, and appointed his own priests from the fringe elements of the people who were not descendants of Levi.
111Kg 12:32 Jeroboam invented a feast for the fifteenth day of the eighth month similar to the feast that takes place in Judah. He approached the altar that he had set up in Bethel and sacrificed to the calves that he had made, having stationed in Bethel the priests that he had appointed. 
111Kg 12:33 Then, on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, he went up to burn incense on the altar that he had set up in Bethel, thus beginning the feast that he had made up out of his own heart for the Israelites.
111Kg 13:1 Right when Jeroboam was standing by the altar to burn some incense, a man of God arrived in Bethel from Judah in obedience to a command from the Lord. 
111Kg 13:2 He cursed the altar in this message from the Lord£º "Hey altar! Hey altar! This is what the Lord says£º 'Pay attention to this! A son is going to be born in David's dynasty. His name will be Josiah. He will sacrifice the priests who burn incense on you in these high places. Human bones will be burned on you!'"
111Kg 13:3 Later that same day, he gave them a special display of power of what was to come when he said, "Here's proof that the Lord has decreed this£º Look! This altar will be split apart and the ashes that are on it will spill out."
111Kg 13:4 When he heard the man of God curse the altar in Bethel, the king pointed at the man of God from where the king was standing at the altar. "Seize him!" he ordered. But all of a sudden his hand that he had stretched out dried up, and he could not bring it back to his side! 
111Kg 13:5 Also, the altar broke apart and the ashes that were on it spilled out from the altar, providing just the proof that the man of God had predicted in his message from the Lord!
111Kg 13:6 "Please!" the king begged the man of God, "Ask the Lord your God and pray for me that my hand may be restored for me!" So the man of God asked the Lord, and the king's hand was immediately and fully restored, just like it had been before. 
111Kg 13:7 So the king told the man of God, "Come back to my palace and rest a while. I'd like to give you a reward."
111Kg 13:8 But the man of God replied to the king, "Even if you were to offer me half of your house, I wouldn't go with you, and I'm sure not going to eat even a piece of bread or drink water in this place, 
111Kg 13:9 because the Lord commanded me specifically, 'You are not to eat bread, drink water, or return by the way that you came to arrive here!'" 
111Kg 13:10 Then he left, returning a different way than the one by which he had traveled to Bethel.
111Kg 13:11 Now there was an old prophet who lived in Bethel, and his sons went to him and told him everything that the man of God had accomplished that day in Bethel, including the message that he had delivered to the king. 
111Kg 13:12 "Which way did he go?" their father asked him, since his sons had observed the way that the man of God had taken to return to Judah from Bethel. 
111Kg 13:13 "Saddle my donkey for me!" he ordered. So they saddled the donkey for him 
111Kg 13:14 and he rode off after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak tree. "You're the man of God who came from Judah, aren't you?" the old prophet asked him. "I am," he replied.
111Kg 13:15 "Come home with me and have a meal," he said to him.
111Kg 13:16 But he replied, "I can't go back with you to your home, be in your company, or even eat food or drink water with you in this place, 
111Kg 13:17 because I've been given a command in the form of this message from the Lord£º 'You are to eat no food, drink no water, and do not return to Judah by traveling the way by which you go there.'"
111Kg 13:18 "I'm a prophet like you," the old man replied, "and an angel spoke to me and delivered this message from the Lord£º 'Bring him back with you to your house and give him food and water.'" But he was lying, 
111Kg 13:19 and the man of God accompanied the old prophet back to his house, ate some food, and drank some water.
111Kg 13:20 Later, while they were sitting down at the table, a message from the Lord was delivered to the prophet who had brought him back, 
111Kg 13:21 so he cried out to the man of God from Judah£º "This is what the Lord says£º 'Because you disobeyed a command from the Lord and haven't done what the Lord your God commanded you to do, 
111Kg 13:22 but instead you returned to eat and drink in the very place that he told you "Eat no food and drink no water," your body will not be buried in the same grave as your ancestors.'"
111Kg 13:23 After the meal was over, and the man had eaten food and had drunk water, the old prophet saddled the donkey for him - that is, for the man of God whom he had brought back. 
111Kg 13:24 Not long after the man of God had left, a lion met him along the road and killed him. His body was left lying in the middle of the road with the donkey standing beside it and with the lion also standing next to the body. 
111Kg 13:25 When some men passed by and noticed the body lying in the middle of the road and the lion standing beside the body, they went straight to the city and told what had happened in the city where the old prophet lived.
111Kg 13:26 The prophet who had brought the man of God back from the road learned about it. "It's the man of God who disobeyed the message from the Lord," he said. "That's why the Lord gave him to that lion, which mauled him and killed him, just as the message from the Lord said to rebuke him." 
111Kg 13:27 Then he ordered his sons, "Saddle the donkey for me." So they did. 
111Kg 13:28 The old prophet went out, located the body on the road where the donkey and the lion were standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body nor mauled the donkey. 
111Kg 13:29 The prophet picked up the body of the man of God, laid it on the donkey, and brought it back to the city where the old man lived so he could mourn and bury him.28
111Kg 13:30 He buried the corpse in his own grave and his family mourned for him, crying out, "Oh, no! My brother!"
111Kg 13:31 After he had buried the man of God, he gave these instructions to his children£º "When I die, bury me in the same grave in which the man of God is buried. Place my bones beside his, 
111Kg 13:32 because what he predicted by a message from the Lord against the altar in Bethel and the temples built in the high places of the cities of Samaria will certainly come about."13
111Kg 13:33 Despite everything that happened, Jeroboam never did repent of his evil practices. Instead, he appointed even more people to act as priests for the high places. Anyone who wanted to be a priest was ordained to be a priest in the high places. 
111Kg 13:34 This practice became so sinful that the Lord decided to erase Jeroboam's dynasty, thus eliminating it from the face of the earth.
111Kg 14:1 Right at that time, Jeroboam's son Abijah became ill, 
111Kg 14:2 so Jeroboam suggested to his wife, "Get up, disguise yourself so that no one will know that you're Jeroboam's wife, and go to Shiloh where the prophet Ahijah lives. He's the one who told me that I would be king over this people. 
111Kg 14:3 Take ten loaves with you, some cakes, and a jar of honey and go visit him. He will tell you what will happen to the boy."
111Kg 14:4 So that's what Jeroboam's wife did. She got up, went to Shiloh, and found Ahijah's home. Ahijah was blind, because his eyes could not focus due to his age. 
111Kg 14:5 Meanwhile, the Lord had spoken to Ahijah, "Be on your guard! Jeroboam's wife is coming to ask you about her son, because he is ill. You're to say such and such to her. When she arrives, she will pretend to be someone else!"
111Kg 14:6 Whe she arrived, Ahijah heard the sound of her feet as she came through the doorway. He said this to her£º "Come in, wife of Jeroboam. What is this pretension at being someone else?I have some harsh news. 
111Kg 14:7 Go tell Jeroboam£º 'I raised you up from among the people. 'I made you commander-in-chief over my people Israel.
111Kg 14:8 'I tore the kingdom away from David's dynasty. 'Then I gave it to you. But you have not lived like my servant David, who kept my commands with all his heart, and did only what I considered to be right.
111Kg 14:9 'Instead, you have done more evil than everyone who lived before you. 'You have gone out and crafted other gods for yourself. 'You made cast images. 'You have provoked me to anger. 'You have thrown me behind your back.
111Kg 14:10 'Therefore, watch while I bring calamity on Jeroboam's dynasty! 'I will eliminate every male, both slave and free in Israel, from Jeroboam. 'I will burn up Jeroboam's dynasty, as a man burns up manure until it is gone. 
111Kg 14:11 Dogs will eat anyone who dies in the city that belongs to Jeroboam's household. The birds of the sky will eat anyone who dies in the open field, because the Lord has determined it.'
111Kg 14:12 "Now get up and go home. When your feet cross the city line, your child will die. 
111Kg 14:13 Everyone in Israel will mourn for him and will bury him, because he alone from Jeroboam's family will receive a decent burial, because something good was observed in him with respect to the Lord God of Israel out of all the household of Jeroboam!
111Kg 14:14 "In addition to this, the Lord will raise up for himself a king over Israel who will eliminate Jeroboam's dynasty, starting today and from now on. 
111Kg 14:15 The Lord will attack Israel, and Israel will shake like a reed shakes in a river current! He will uproot Israel from this good land that he gave to their ancestors and he will scatter them beyond the Euphrates River, because they erected their Asherim and provoked the Lord to become angry! 
111Kg 14:16 He will give up Israel because of Jeroboam's sins that he committed and by which Jeroboam caused Israel to sin."
111Kg 14:17 Then Jeroboam's wife got up and left for Tirzah. As soon as she set foot over the threshold of the house, the child died. 
111Kg 14:18 All of Israel mourned him at his burial, just as the Lord had said when he spoke through Ahijah the prophet.
111Kg 14:19 Now as for the rest of Jeroboam's accomplishments, including how he waged war and how he reigned, you may read about them in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. 
111Kg 14:20 Jeroboam reigned for 22 years and then died, as had his ancestors, and his son Nadab reigned in his place.
111Kg 14:21 Meanwhile, Solomon's son Rehoboam reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was 41 years old when he became king, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city where the Lord had chosen from all the tribes of Israel to place his Name. His mother was an Ammonite named Naamah.
111Kg 14:22 Judah practiced what the Lord considered to be evil. They did more to provoke him to jealousy than their ancestors had ever done by committing the sins that they committed. 
111Kg 14:23 They erected high places, sacred pillars, and Asherim for themselves on every high hill and under every green tree. 
111Kg 14:24 They even maintained male shrine prostitutes throughout the land, and imitated every detestable practice that the nations practiced whom the Lord had expelled in front of the Israelites.1421
111Kg 14:25 As a result, during the fifth year of the reign of King Rehoboam, King Shishak of Egypt invaded and attacked Jerusalem. 
111Kg 14:26 He stripped the Lord's temple and the royal palace of their treasures. He took everything, even the gold shields that Solomon had made. 
111Kg 14:27 King Rehoboam made shields out of bronze to take their place, and then committed them to the care and custody of the commanders of those who guarded the entrance to the royal palace. 
111Kg 14:28 Whenever the king entered the Lord's temple, the guards would carry them to and from the guard's quarters.
111Kg 14:29 As to the rest of Rehoboam's accomplishments, and everything else that he undertook, they are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, aren't they?
111Kg 14:30 There was continual warfare between Rehoboam and Jeroboam, 
111Kg 14:31 but eventually Rehoboam died, as had his ancestors, and he was buried with his ancestors in the city of David. His mother's name had been Naamah the Ammonite, and his son Abijam became king to replace him.
111Kg 15:1 Abijah reigned over Judah starting in the eighteenth year of Nebat's son Jeroboam's reign. 
111Kg 15:2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom. 
111Kg 15:3 He practiced the same sins that his father committed before he was born. Unlike his ancestor David, his heart never became devoted to the Lord his God. 
111Kg 15:4 Nevertheless, for the sake of David, the Lord his God maintained a lamp for David in Jerusalem by raising up his son after him so that Jerusalem would be established, 
111Kg 15:5 because David had practiced what the Lord considered to be right. He never avoided anything that the Lord had commanded him during his entire lifetime, except for the case of Uriah the Hittite.
111Kg 15:6 There was continual military conflict between Rehoboam and Jeroboam throughout his entire lifetime. 
111Kg 15:7 The rest of Abijam's accomplishments, including everything he undertook, are written in the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not?And a state of war continued to exist between Abijam and Jeroboam. 
111Kg 15:8 Eventually, Abijam died, as did his ancestors, and he was buried in the city of David. His son Asa succeeded him as king.
111Kg 15:9 Asa began to reign as Judah's king during the twentieth year of the reign of Jeroboam as king over Israel. 
111Kg 15:10 He reigned 41 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Maacah, the daughter of Abishalom. 
111Kg 15:11 Asa practiced what the Lord considered to be right, just like his ancestor David. 
111Kg 15:12 He also removed the male cult prostitutes from the land and destroyed all the idols that his ancestors had made. 
111Kg 15:13 He removed his mother Maacah from her position as Queen Mother because she had made a detestable image dedicated to Asherah. Asa cut down his mother's idol, crushed it, and burned it at the Kidron Brook. 
111Kg 15:14 Nevertheless, the high places were not removed, even though Asa's heart was blameless toward the Lord all of his life. 
111Kg 15:15 Asa brought into the Lord's temple the things that his father had dedicated, as well as his own dedicated gifts such as silver, gold, and temple service implements.
111Kg 15:16 A state of continual military unrest existed between Asa and King Baasha of Israel throughout their lifetimes. 
111Kg 15:17 King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and interdicted Ramah by building fortifications around it so no one could enter or leave to join King Asa of Judah. 
111Kg 15:18 But Asa removed all the silver and gold from the treasuries of the Lord's temple and from his royal palace, placed them into the care of some servants, and then sent them to Tabrimon's son King Ben-hadad of Aram, the grandson of Hezion, who lived in Damascus.
111Kg 15:19 "Let's make a treaty between you and me," he said, "just like the one between my father and your father. Notice that I've sent you silver and gold to break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel, so he'll retreat from his attack on me."
111Kg 15:20 So King Ben-hadad did just what King Asa had asked£º he sent his commanding officers to attack the cities of Israel, conquering Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, all of the Sea of Galilee, and the territory of Naphtali. 
111Kg 15:21 When Baasha learned of this, he stopped fortifying Ramah and remained in Tirzah, 
111Kg 15:22 so King Asa published a proclamation throughout Judah (no one was left out) and they carried away the stones and timber with which Baasha had been fortifying Judah. King Asa used them to fortify Geba in Benjamin and Mizpah.
111Kg 15:23 The rest of Asa's accomplishments, his strength, everything that he undertook, and the cities that he fortified are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not?However, as he approached old age, he became diseased in his feet. 
111Kg 15:24 Then Asa died, as had his ancestors, and he was buried with his ancestors in the city of David, his ancestor. His son Jehoshaphat reigned in his place.23
111Kg 15:25 Jeroboam's son Nadab became king over Israel during the second year of the reign of King Asa over Judah. He reigned over Israel for two years, 
111Kg 15:26 practicing what the Lord considered to be evil, living the way his father did, committing sins, and leading Israel to sin. 
111Kg 15:27 So Ahijah's son Baasha from the household of Issachar conspired against him and killed Nadab at Gibbethon in Philistia while Nadab and all of Israel were attacking Gibbethon. 
111Kg 15:28 Baasha killed him during the third year of the reign of King Asa of Judah and took Nadab's place as king.1525
111Kg 15:29 As soon as he was established as king, he killed everyone in the household of Jeroboam. He left not even one single person alive. He destroyed them completely, just as the Lord had spoken through his servant Ahijah the Shilonite, 
111Kg 15:30 because of the sins that Jeroboam had committed, and because he led Israel into sin, provoking the Lord God of Israel to become angry.
111Kg 15:31 Now the rest of Nadab's accomplishments, including everything he undertook, are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
111Kg 15:32 Meanwhile, a state of war continued to exist between Asa and Baasha king of Israel, throughout their reigns.
111Kg 15:33 During the third year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Ahijah's son Baasha became king over all of Israel. He reigned for 24 years at Tirzah. 
111Kg 15:34 He practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, living like Jeroboam did and leading Israel into sin.
111Kg 16:1 Later, a message came from the Lord to Hanani's son Jehu. It was directed to rebuke Baasha, and this is what it said:
111Kg 16:2 I raised you from the dirt to become commander-in-chief over my people Israel, but you've been living like Jeroboam, you've been leading my people Israel into sin, and you've been provoking me to anger with their sins. 
111Kg 16:3 So watch out! I'm going to devour Baasha and his household. I'm going to make your household just like the household of Jeroboam, Nebat's son. 
111Kg 16:4 Anyone from Baasha's household who dies in the city will be eaten by dogs, and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the sky will eat."
111Kg 16:5 Now the rest of Baasha's accomplishments, including everything that he undertook, as well as his strengths, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
111Kg 16:6 Eventually, Baasha died, as had his ancestors, and he was buried in Tirzah. His son Elah was installed as king in his place.
111Kg 16:7 In addition, a message from the Lord came through Hanani's son Jehu the prophet against Baasha and his household, not only because of all of the things that Baasha did that the Lord considered to be evil, including provoking the Lord to anger by what he did and by being like the household of Jeroboam, but also because Baasha had destroyed Jeroboam's household.
111Kg 16:8 During the twenty-sixth year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Baasha's son Elah became king over Israel and reigned at Tirzah for two years. 
111Kg 16:9 But his servant Zimri, who commanded half of his chariot forces, conspired against Elah while he was drinking himself drunk in the home of Arza, who managed the household at Tirzah. 
111Kg 16:10 Zimri went inside, attacked him, and killed him in the twenty-seventh year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, and then became king in Elah's place. 
111Kg 16:11 As soon as he had consolidated his reign, he executed the entire household of Baasha. He did not leave a single male alive, including any of Baasha's relatives or friends. 
111Kg 16:12 In doing so, Zimri destroyed the entire household of Baasha, in keeping with the message from the Lord that he had spoken against Baasha through Jehu the prophet 
111Kg 16:13 because of all the sins that Baasha and his son Elah had committed and because of what they did to lead Israel into sin, thus provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger with their idolatry. 
111Kg 16:14 Now the rests of Elah's accomplishments, including everything he undertook, are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not - 
111Kg 16:15 Zimri reigned for seven days at Tirzah during the twenty-seventh year of the reign of King Asa of Judah. At that time, the army was encamped in a siege against Gibbethon of Philistia. 
111Kg 16:16 The army at the encampment heard this report£º "Zimri has conspired against the king and killed him." So the entire army of Israel made Omri, their commander, king over Israel. 
111Kg 16:17 Then Omri and the entire army of Israel left from Gibbethon and attacked Tirzah. 
111Kg 16:18 When Zimri observed that the city had been captured, he retreated into the king's palace, set fire to the citadel, and died when the palace burned down around him 
111Kg 16:19 because of the sins that he committed by doing what the Lord considered to be evil, living like Jeroboam did, and sinning so as to lead Israel into sin. 
111Kg 16:20 The rest of Zimri's accomplishments, including his conspiracy that he carried out, are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not - 15
111Kg 16:21 The army of Israel was divided into two parties£º half of the army were loyal to Ginath's son Tibni and wanted to make him king, and half were loyal to Omri. 
111Kg 16:22 But the army that was loyal to Omri was victorious over Ginath's son Tibni. Tibni later died and Omri became king. 
111Kg 16:23 During the thirty-first year of the reign of King Asa of Judah, Omri became king over Israel. He reigned for twelve years, six of them at Tirzah. 
111Kg 16:24 He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, fortified the hill, and named the city Samaria after Shemer, the former owner of the hill. 
111Kg 16:25 Omri practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, doing far more evil than anyone who had reigned before him. 
111Kg 16:26 He lived just like Nebat's son Jeroboam, and by his sin he led Israel into sin, provoking the Lord God of Israel with their idolatry. 
111Kg 16:27 Now the rest of Omri's accomplishments, including the power that he demonstrated, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
111Kg 16:28 So Omri died, as had his ancestors, and he was buried in Samaria. His son Ahab became king in his place.1627
111Kg 16:29 Omri's son Ahab became king over Israel in the thirty-eighth year of King Asa of Judah. He reigned over Israel in Samaria for 22 years. 
111Kg 16:30 Omri's son Ahab practiced more of what the Lord considered to be evil than anyone who had lived before him. 
111Kg 16:31 In fact, as if it were nothing for him to live like Nebat's son Jeroboam, Ahab married Jezebel, the daughter of King Ethbaal of Sidon. Then he went out to serve Baal and worship him. 
111Kg 16:32 He built an altar for Baal in a temple for Baal that he constructed in Samaria. 
111Kg 16:33 Ahab also erected an Asherah, doing more to provoke the Lord God of Israel than all of the kings of Israel who had reigned before him. 
111Kg 16:34 It was during Ahab's reign that Hiel the Bethelite rebuilt Jericho. He laid its foundations just as his first born son Abiram was dying, and he erected its gates while his youngest son Segub was dying, thus fulfilling the message that the Lord delivered through Nun's son Joshua.16
111Kg 17:1 Elijah the foreigner, who was an alien resident from Gilead, told Ahab, "As the Lord God of Israel lives, in whose presence I'm standing, there will be neither dew nor rain these next several years, except when I say so."
111Kg 17:2 Later, this message came to him from the Lord£º 
111Kg 17:3 "Leave here and go into hiding at the Wadi Cherith, where it enters the Jordan River. 
111Kg 17:4 You will be able to drink from that brook, and I've commanded some crows to sustain you there." So Elijah left and did exactly what the Lord had told him to do - he went to live near the Wadi Cherith, where it enters the Jordan River. 
111Kg 17:6 Crows would bring him bread and meat both in the morning and in the evening, and he would drink from the brook. 
111Kg 17:7 But after a while, the brook dried up because there had been no rain in the land.
111Kg 17:8 Then this message came to him from the Lord£º 
111Kg 17:9 "Get up, move to Zarephath in Sidon, and stay there. Look! I've commanded a widow to sustain you there."
111Kg 17:10 So he got up and went to Zarephath. As he arrived at the entrance to the city, a widow was there gathering sticks. So he asked her, "Please, may I have some water in a cup so I can have a drink." 
111Kg 17:11 While she was on her way to get the water, he called out to her, "Would you please also bring me a piece of bread while you're at it?"
111Kg 17:12 "As the Lord your God lives," she replied, "I don't have so much as a muffin, just a handful of flour in a bowl and some oil left in a bottle. Now I'm going to find some sticks so I can cook a last meal for my son and for me. Then we're going to eat it and die."
111Kg 17:13 But Elijah said to her, "You can stop being afraid. Go and do what you said, but first make me a muffin and bring it to me. Then make a meal for yourself and for your son, 
111Kg 17:14 because this is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'That jar of flour will not run out, nor will that bottle of oil become empty until the very day that the Lord sends rain on the surface of the ground.'"
111Kg 17:15 So she went out and did precisely what Elijah told her to do. As a result, Elijah, the widow, and her son were fed for days. 
111Kg 17:16 The jar of flour never ran out and the bottle of oil never became empty, just as the Lord had promised through Elijah.
111Kg 17:17 Sometime later, the son of the woman who owned the house became ill. In fact, his illness became so severe that he died. 
111Kg 17:18 "What do we have in common, you man of God?" she accused Elijah. "You came to me so you could uncover my guilt! And you're responsible for the death of my son!"
111Kg 17:19 "Give me your son," he replied. Then he took him from her lap, carried him upstairs to the room where he lived, and laid him on his bed. 
111Kg 17:20 Then he called out to the Lord and asked him, "Lord my God, have you also brought evil to this dear widow with whom I am living as her guest?Have you caused the death of her son?" 
111Kg 17:21 Then he stretched himself three times and cried out to the Lord, "Lord my God, please cause the soul of this little boy to return to him."1720
111Kg 17:22 The Lord listened to Elijah, and the soul of the little boy returned to him, and he revived. 
111Kg 17:23 Then Elijah took the little boy downstairs from the upper chamber back into the main house and delivered him to his mother. "Look," Elijah told her, "your son is alive."
111Kg 17:24 The woman responded to Elijah, "Now at last I've really learned that you are a man of God and that what you have to say about the Lord is the truth."
111Kg 18:1 Quite some time later - three years later!?this message from the Lord came to Elijah£º "Go visit Ahab, and I'll send some rain to the surface of the ground." 
111Kg 18:2 So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab, right when the famine in Samaria was most severe.
111Kg 18:3 Ahab called for Obadiah, his household supervisor. This man, who feared the Lord very much, 
111Kg 18:4 had taken 100 prophets and had hidden them by fifties in a cave, providing them with food and water when Jezebel was trying to destroy the Lord's prophets.
111Kg 18:5 Ahab had instructed Obadiah, "Go throughout the land to all of the water springs and to all of the valleys. Maybe we'll find some grass to keep the horses and mules alive. Also, maybe we won't have to kill some of our cattle." 
111Kg 18:6 So they divided the land between them so they could conduct their survey. Ahab went off by himself in one direction and Obadiah went off by himself in the other.
111Kg 18:7 While Obadiah was on the road, Elijah met him. Obadiah recognized him and bowed down with his face to the ground. "It's you, isn't it, my master Elijah?"
111Kg 18:8 "I am," he replied. "Go tell your master, 'Look! Elijah!'"
111Kg 18:9 But Obadiah replied, "What did I do wrong, that you would put me in a position where Ahab would execute me?
111Kg 18:10 As surely as the Lord your God lives, there isn't a nation or kingdom where my master hasn't tried to find you. Whenever they would say 'He isn't here,' he forced that kingdom or nation to swear that they hadn't seen you. 
111Kg 18:11 But now you're saying 'Go tell your master, "Elijah is here!"' 
111Kg 18:12 As soon as I've left you, the Spirit of the Lord will carry you off to I don't know where! Then when I go tell Ahab and he can't find you, he'll kill me, even though I have been your servant and have feared the Lord since I was young! 
111Kg 18:13 Hasn't anyone told you, my master, what I did when Jezebel was killing the Lord's prophets?I hid 100 of the Lord's prophets by fifties in a cave and provided food and water for them. 
111Kg 18:14 Now you're saying, 'Go tell your master, "Elijah's here!"' He's sure to kill me!"1812
111Kg 18:15 But Elijah promised him, "As the Lord of the Heavenly Armies lives, in whose presence I stand, I will appear to Ahab today."
111Kg 18:16 So Obadiah went out to meet Ahab and reported to him. Then Ahab went to meet Elijah. 
111Kg 18:17 When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab asked him, "Is it really you, you destroyer of Israel?"
111Kg 18:18 But Elijah replied, "I'm no destroyer of Israel. But you and your ancestor's household have been doing that, because you have abandoned the Lord's commandments and have followed the Baals. 
111Kg 18:19 So go gather all of Israel to meet me on Mount Carmel. Bring along 450 prophets of Baal and 400 prophets of the Asherah who are funded at Jezebel's expense."
111Kg 18:20 Ahab sent for the Israelites and brought the prophets together at Mount Carmel, 
111Kg 18:21 where Elijah approached all the people and asked them, "How long will you keep limping back and forth between both sides?If the Lord is God, go after him. If Baal, go after him." But the people didn't say a word.
111Kg 18:22 So Elijah told the people, "I'm the only one left over as a prophet of the Lord, am I?But Baal's prophets number 450 men?
111Kg 18:23 So let them provide two oxen. They can choose one ox for themselves. Cut if up, lay it on top of some wood, but don't set fire to it. I will prepare the other ox and lay it on top of some wood, and I won't set fire to it. 
111Kg 18:24 Then you can call on the name of your god, and I'll call on the name of the Lord. Let the God who answers by fire be our God!" "That's a good idea!" all the people shouted.
111Kg 18:25 So Elijah told the prophets of Baal, "Choose an ox for yourselves and you prepare it first, since there are so many of you. Call on the name of your god, but don't set fire to the offering."18
111Kg 18:26 So they took the ox that was given to them, prepared it, and called on the name of Baal from early morning until noon. "Baal! Answer us!" they cried. But there was no response. Nobody answered. So they kept on dancing around the altar that they had made.
111Kg 18:27 Starting about noon, Elijah began to tease them£º "Shout louder! "He's a god, so maybe he's busy. "Maybe he's relieving himself. "Maybe he's busy someplace. "Maybe he's taking a nap and somebody needs to wake him up."
111Kg 18:28 So the prophets of Baal cried even louder and slashed themselves with swords and lances until their blood gushed out all over them, as was their custom. 
111Kg 18:29 They kept on raving right through midday and until it was time to offer the evening sacrifice, but there was still no response. Nobody answered, and nobody paid attention.
111Kg 18:30 Eventually, Elijah told everybody, "Come here!" So everybody approached him, and he repaired the Lord's altar that had been torn down. 
111Kg 18:31 Elijah took twelve stones, one for each of the tribes of Jacob's descendants, to whom the message from the Lord had come that "Israel shall be your name." 
111Kg 18:32 So Elijah used the stones to build an altar to the name of the Lord. But then he dug a trench around the altar large enough to hold two measures of seed. 
111Kg 18:33 Then he laid the wood in order, cut the bull into pieces, and laid them on top of the wood. "Fill four pitchers with water," he ordered. "Then pour them out on the burnt offering and the wood."
111Kg 18:34 "Do it a second time," he ordered. So they did a second time. "Do it a third time," he said. So they did it a third time. 
111Kg 18:35 The water ran down around the altar and completely filled the trench.
111Kg 18:36 As the time for the evening offering arrived, Elijah the prophet approached and said, "Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known today that you are God in Israel and that I, your servant, have done all of this in obedience to your word. 
111Kg 18:37 Answer me, Lord! Answer me so that this people may know that you, Lord, are God, and that you are turning back their hearts again."
111Kg 18:38 Right then the Lord's fire fell and consumed the burnt offering, the wood, the stones, the dust, and even the water that was in the trench! 
111Kg 18:39 When all the people saw what had happened, they fell flat on their faces and cried out "The Lord is God! The Lord is God!"
111Kg 18:40 But Elijah said, "Arrest the prophets of Baal. Don't let even one of them get away." So the people seized them, and Elijah brought them down to the Wadi Kishon and executed them there.
111Kg 18:41 After this, Elijah told Ahab, "Get up and have something to eat and drink, because there's the sound of a coming rainstorm." 
111Kg 18:42 So Ahab got up to get something to eat and drink while Elijah went back up to the top of Mount Carmel, where he bowed low to the ground and placed his face between his knees.
111Kg 18:43 Then he told his young servant, "Go and look toward the sea." So he went and looked out to sea. "Nothing there," he said. But Elijah told him to go back seven times. 
111Kg 18:44 On the seventh look, he said, "Look! There's a cloud, a small one, about the size of a man's hand. It's coming up out of the sea!" "Get up and find Ahab!" Elijah said. "Tell him, 'Mount your chariot and ride down the mountain so the storm doesn't stop you.'"
111Kg 18:45 A little while later, the sky turned black with storm clouds and winds, and there was a heavy shower. So Ahab rode off to Jezreel. 
111Kg 18:46 After Ahab had left, the hand of the Lord came upon Elijah, and he tucked his mantle into his belt and outran Ahab in a race to the city gate of Jezreel.
111Kg 19:1 Ahab complained to Jezebel about everything that Elijah had done, especially the part about him killing all the prophets of Baal with a sword. 
111Kg 19:2 Jezebel sent a messenger to tell Elijah, "May the gods do the same to me and even more if tomorrow about this time I haven't made you like one of those prophets you had killed."
111Kg 19:3 Elijah was terrified, so he got up and ran for his life to Beersheba, which is part of Judah, and left his servant there 
111Kg 19:4 and ran for a day's journey deep into the wilderness. He found a juniper tree, sat down under it, and prayed that he could die. He asked God, "Enough! Lord! Take my life, because I'm not better than my ancestors!" 
111Kg 19:5 Then he lay down and went to sleep under the juniper tree. All of a sudden, there was an angel, who kept grabbing him and telling him, "Get up! Eat!"
111Kg 19:6 So he looked around, and there near his head was a muffin sitting on top of some heated stones, along with a jar of water. Elijah ate and drank and then lay down again. 
111Kg 19:7 Later, the angel of the Lord came a second time, grabbed him, and said "Get up! Eat! The journey ahead is too difficult for you!" 
111Kg 19:8 So Elijah got up, ate and drank, and survived on that one meal for 40 days and nights as he set out on his journey to Horeb, God's mountain.7
111Kg 19:9 Elijah arrived at a cave and stayed there. All of a sudden this message came from the Lord£º "What are you doing here, Elijah?"
111Kg 19:10 "I've been very zealous for the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies," he replied. "The Israelites have abandoned your covenant, demolished your altars, executed your prophets with swords, and I - that's right, just me! - am the only one left. Now they're seeking my life, to get rid of me!"
111Kg 19:11 "Go out," he responded, "and stand on the mountain in the presence of the Lord." And there was the Lord, passing by! A tremendous, mighty windstorm was tearing at the mountains and breaking the rocks in pieces in the presence of the Lord, but the Lord was not in the windstorm. After the wind there came an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. 
111Kg 19:12 After the earthquake there came fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire, there was the sound of a gentle whisper. 
111Kg 19:13 As soon as Elijah heard it, he covered his face in his mantle, went outside, and stood at the entrance to the cave. And there a voice spoke to him and said, "What are you doing here, Elijah?"1912
111Kg 19:14 "I've been very zealous for the Lord God of the Heavenly Armies," he replied. "The Israelites have abandoned your covenant, demolished your altars, executed your prophets with swords, and I - that's right, just me! - am the only one left. Now they're seeking my life, to get rid of me!"
111Kg 19:15 The Lord replied to him, "Go! Return to Damascus, and when you get there, anoint Hazael as king over Aram, 
111Kg 19:16 anoint Nimshi's son Jehu as king over Israel, and anoint Shaphat's son Elisha from Abel-meholah as a prophet to replace you. 
111Kg 19:17 Whoever escapes from Hazael's sword Jehu will execute, and whoever escapes from Jehu's sword Elisha will put to death. 
111Kg 19:18 Nevertheless, I've reserved 7,000 in Israel who have neither bowed their knees to Baal nor kissed him."
111Kg 19:19 Elijah left there and located Shaphat's son Elisha, who was plowing, along with a total of twelve pairs of oxen. (He was plowing with the twelfth pair.) As Elijah passed by, he tossed his cloak at Elisha. 
111Kg 19:20 He abandoned the oxen, ran off to follow Elijah, and asked him, "Please, let me kiss my mother and father good-bye, and then I'll come after you." "Go back again," Elijah replied. "What have I done to you?"
111Kg 19:21 So Elisha turned back, took the pair of oxen, sacrificed them, boiled their flesh using the farm implements for fuel, and gave the food to the people with him. Then he got up, followed Elijah, and became his servant.
111Kg 20:1 A little while later, King Ben-haddad of Aram mustered an army of cavalry and chariots in a military confederacy with 32 kings, invaded Samaria set up siege encampments there. 
111Kg 20:2 Then he sent envoys to visit King Ahab of Israel and tell him, "This is what Ben-hadad says£º 
111Kg 20:3 'Your silver and gold belong to me. So do the most beautiful of your wives and children.'"1
111Kg 20:4 "Whatever you want, your majesty," the king of Israel answered. "I belong to you, as does everything I own."
111Kg 20:5 After delivering Ahab's answer, the envoys returned with this message£º "This is what Ben-hadad says£º 'I've sent my envoys to you to tell you that your silver, gold, wives, and children are to be given to me. 
111Kg 20:6 About this time tomorrow, I'll send my servants to you, and they'll search through your palace and your servants' houses. Whatever is important to you will be seized and taken away.'"
111Kg 20:7 Then the king of Israel called together all of the elders of the land and told them, "Please note that this man is here looking for trouble. He sent a message to me, demanding my wives, my children, and my silver and gold, and I haven't refused him."
111Kg 20:8 "Don't listen to him, " all the elders and the people replied. "And don't agree to his terms."
111Kg 20:9 So he told Ben-haddad's envoys, "Tell his majesty the king, 'Everything that you asked for the first time I will do, but this thing I cannot do.'" So the envoys left to deliver Ahab's response. They returned a little while later.
111Kg 20:10 Beh-hadad sent this message back£º "May the gods do so to me, and more than that also, if the dust that remains of Samaria is enough to fill up a few handfuls for all of the armies at my disposal."
111Kg 20:11 But the king of Israel replied, "Tell him, 'The one who is starting to strap on his battle armor should never brag like the one who is taking it off.'"
111Kg 20:12 Ben-hadad received Ahab's response while he was celebrating with his kings in the battle pavilions. "Sound 'Battle Stations!'" he ordered, and the army began to prepare their attack.
111Kg 20:13 Right about then, a prophet approached King Ahab of Israel and told him, "This is what the Lord says£º 'You see all of this great big army, do you?Well now, I'm going to deliver them all right into your hand, and you will learn that I am the Lord!'"
111Kg 20:14  "By whom?" Ahab asked. "This is what the Lord says," the prophet replied. "'By the young men who serve as officials within the provinces.'" "Who is to begin the battle?" Ahab asked. "You," the prophet answered.
111Kg 20:15 So Ahab gathered together 232 young men who served as officials within the provinces and then mustered 7,000 soldiers from among the Israelites. 
111Kg 20:16 They attacked at noon, just as Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the battle pavilions, along with the 32 kings who had joined him. 
111Kg 20:17 The young men who served as officials within the provinces led the charge, and somebody informed Ben-hadad, "Some men have come out from Samaria."
111Kg 20:18 "Take them alive, whether they've come in peace or not," he ordered.
111Kg 20:19 Meanwhile, as the young men who served as officials within the provinces left the city, their army followed after them. 
111Kg 20:20 Each man struck down his opponent, and the Arameans ran away with Israel in pursuit. King Ben-hadad of Aram escaped on horseback with the help of his cavalry. 
111Kg 20:21 The king of Israel went out and attacked the cavalry and chariots and killed the Arameans in a massive victory.
111Kg 20:22 The prophet approached the king of Israel and told him, "Go replenish your forces and prepare for the future, because early this next year the king of Aram will attack you again."
111Kg 20:23 Sure enough, the advisors to the king of Aram told him, "Their gods are mountain gods. That's why they were stronger than we were. But when we fight them on the plains, we're certain to be the stronger army! 
111Kg 20:24 So do this£º remove the kings from command and replace them with captains. 
111Kg 20:25 Then replace the army that you lost, horse-for-horse and chariot-for-chariot. We'll fight them on the plains, and we're certain to be the stronger army." Ben-hadad listened to what they had to say and carried out their advice.
111Kg 20:26 Early the next year, Ben-hadad mustered the Arameans and invaded Aphek in a battle against Israel. 
111Kg 20:27 The Israelites were mustered, equipped with provisions, and sent out to fight. The Israelite encampment looked like two little flocks of goats compared to how the Aramean encampments filled the countryside!
111Kg 20:28 Right about then, a man of God approached and told the king of Israel, "This is what the Lord says£º 'Because the Arameans keep saying "The Lord is a mountain god, but isn't a valley god," I'm going to deliver this entire vast army right into your control, so you'll learn that I really am the Lord.'" 
111Kg 20:29 So they remained in opposing camps for seven days. Then on the seventh day the battle commenced, and the Israelites killed 100,000 Aramean infantry troops in a single day. 
111Kg 20:30 The rest of the Aramean army retreated into Aphek, but the city wall collapsed on 27,000 soldiers who had taken shelter there. Ben-hadad himself ran away and hid inside a closet somewhere in the city.
111Kg 20:31 "Look, now," his advisors suggested, "we've heard that the Israelite kings are merciful. So let's clothe ourselves with sackcloth, tie our hair back with ropes, and go out to the king of Israel. Maybe he'll spare your life." So they put on some sackcloth, tied their hair back with ropes, and approached the king of Israel. "Your servant Ben-hadad says this," they said. "Please let me live." "Is he still alive?" Ahab asked. "He's my brother."
111Kg 20:33 Ben-hadad's advisors, quickly analyzing the signs in what Ahab was saying, responded, "Yes, your brother Ben-hadad." "Go get him," Ahab responded. So Ben-hadad came out to him, and Ahab took him up into his personal chariot.
111Kg 20:34 Ben-hadad made this promise to Ahab£º "I will restore the cities that my ancestors took from your ancestors. You'll be able to build streets named after yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria." "With this promise I will release you," Ahab replied. So Ahab made a treaty with Ben-hadad and let him go.
111Kg 20:35 Right about then, one of the members of the guild of prophets told another by way of a message from the Lord£º "Please strike me!" But the man refused to do so, 
111Kg 20:36 so he told him, "Because you haven't obeyed the Lord's voice, as soon as you leave here, a lion will kill you." As soon as the man left, a lion found him and killed him.20
111Kg 20:37 Later, he found another man and told him, "Please strike me!" So the man struck him and wounded him. 
111Kg 20:38 Then the prophet left and waited for the king to pass by, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes.
111Kg 20:39 As the king was passing by, he cried out to the king and told him, "Your servant went out into the middle of the battle, and a soldier turned aside, brought a prisoner to me, and told me, 'Guard this man. If he turns up missing for any reason at all, you'll pay for it with your life or be fined 75 pounds of silver.' 
111Kg 20:40 While your servant was busy here and there, the prisoner escaped." The king told him, "By your actions you've earned the proper judgment!"
111Kg 20:41 Then the prophet quickly tore off his bandage, and the king of Israel recognized him as being one of the prophets. 
111Kg 20:42 He told the king, "This is what the Lord says£º 'Because you let the man whom I had dedicated to destruction go free, therefore your life shall be forfeited for his life, and your people for his people.'"20
111Kg 20:43 After hearing this, the king of Israel rode back to his palace in Samaria, frustrated and in a foul mood.
111Kg 21:1 Meanwhile, there was a man named Naboth from Jezreel who owned a vineyard that was located contiguous to King Ahab's palace in Samaria. 
111Kg 21:2 Ahab addressed Naboth and asked him, "I would like to plant a vegetable garden near my house. Please exchange your vineyard with a better one from me, or if you'd rather have cash, I'll buy it for its full value."
111Kg 21:3 But Naboth replied to Ahab, "No way! The Lord prohibits the sale to you of the inheritance of my ancestors!"
111Kg 21:4 Ahab went back to his palace, sullen and in a foul mood, because Naboth the Jezreelite had turned down Ahab's offer by saying "I will not transfer my ancestors' inheritance to you!" He laid down on his bed, curled up with his face to the wall, and refused to eat.
111Kg 21:5 But his wife Jezebel went to him and asked him, "How is it that you're so sullen and refusing to eat?"
111Kg 21:6 "I asked Naboth the Jezreelite, 'Sell me your vineyard for cash, or if you want, I'll give you a better one in its place.' But he refused. He told me, 'I won't give you my vineyard!'"
111Kg 21:7 "Aren't you the reigning king of Israel," his wife Jezebel replied. "Get up, have a meal, and get ready to be happy. I'll go get you the vineyard that Naboth the Jezreelite owns." 
111Kg 21:8 So she wrote some memos in Ahab's name, set his personal seal to them, and sent them to the elders and nobles who lived with Naboth in his city. 
111Kg 21:9 In the memos, she wrote the following directives£º "Proclaim a public fast and seat Naboth in the front row. 
111Kg 21:10 Seat two wicked men in front of him, and make them testify against him. Tell them to claim 'You cursed God and the king.' Then take him out and stone him to death."
111Kg 21:11 So the leading men of the city, along with the elders and nobles who lived there, did precisely what Jezebel had directed them to do. They followed the instructions that she had set forth in the memos£º 
111Kg 21:12 They proclaimed a public fast and seated Naboth in the front row. 
111Kg 21:13 Two wicked men came in, sat down in front of them, and testified against Naboth in public, "Naboth cursed God and the king!" So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death.
111Kg 21:14 Afterwards, they sent a message to Jezebel that said, "Naboth has been stoned. He's dead."
111Kg 21:15 When Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned to death, she told Ahab, "Get up and confiscate Naboth's vineyard that he refused to sell you for cash. Naboth the Jezreelite isn't alive any more. He's dead!" 
111Kg 21:16 So once he heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab got up, went down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, and confiscated it.
111Kg 21:17 That's when this message from the Lord came to Elijah the foreigner£º "Get up and go down to meet King Ahab of Israel. He's in Samaria. Look! He's in Naboth's vineyard, where he's gone to confiscate it. 
111Kg 21:19 Ask the king, 'Did you commit murder?And now you're going to steal as well?' Also tell him, 'This is what the Lord says£º "Where the dogs were licking up Naboth's blood, dogs will also lick up your blood - that's right - yours!"'"2117
111Kg 21:20 Later on, Ahab asked Elijah, "Have you found me, my enemy?" But Elijah answered, "I've found you because you sold yourself to do what the Lord considers to be evil! 
111Kg 21:21 Now pay attention! I'm going to send evil in your direction! I will completely sweep you away and eliminate from Ahab every male, whether indentured servant or free, throughout Israel. 
111Kg 21:22 I will make your household resemble that of Nebat's son Jeroboam, or like the household of Ahijah's son Baasha, because of how you've provoked me to anger and made Israel to sin. 
111Kg 21:23 The Lord also has this to say about Jezebel£º 'Dogs will eat Jezebel within the outer ramparts of Jezreel. 
111Kg 21:24 Dogs will eat whoever belongs to Ahab and who dies in the city. The birds of the sky will eat whoever dies in the fields.'"
111Kg 21:25 It can be truly said that no one else sold himself to practice what the Lord considered to be evil quite like the way Ahab did, because his wife Jezebel incited him. 
111Kg 21:26 His behavior in pursuing idolatry was detestable, just like the Amorites had done whom the Lord had expelled in front of the army of Israel. 
111Kg 21:27 Nevertheless, as soon as Ahab heard this message, he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, and fasted. He even slept in sackcloth and wandered around meekly.
111Kg 21:28 Later, this message from the Lord came to Elijah the foreigner£º 
111Kg 21:29 "Have you noticed that Ahab has humbled himself in my presence?Because he has humbled himself in my presence, I will not bring his evil to harvest during his lifetime, but I will bring evil to his household during his son's lifetime."
111Kg 22:1 Three years passed without war between Aram and Israel. 
111Kg 22:2 During that third year, King Jehoshaphat of Judah went to visit the king of Israel. 
111Kg 22:3 The king of Israel asked his servants, "Were you aware that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, but we aren't doing anything to remove it from the control of the king of Aram?"
111Kg 22:4 Then he asked Jehoshaphat, "Will you join me in battle against Ramoth-gilead?" "I'm with you," Jehoshaphat answered the king of Israel. "My army will join yours, and my cavalry will be your cavalry." 
111Kg 22:5 But Jehoshaphat also asked the king of Israel, "Please ask for a message from the Lord, first."
111Kg 22:6 So the king of Israel called in about 400 prophets and asked them, "Should we go attack Ramoth-gilead, or should I call off the attack?" "Go attack them," they all said, "because the Lord will drop them right into the king's hand!"
111Kg 22:7 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there a prophet of the Lord left here that we could talk to?"
111Kg 22:8 "There is still one man left by whom we could ask the Lord what to do," the king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat, "but I hate him because he never prophesies anything good about me. Instead, he prophesies evil. He is Imla's son Micaiah." But Jehoshaphat rebuked Ahab, "Kings should never talk like that."
111Kg 22:9 Nevertheless, the king of Israel called one of his officers and ordered him, "Bring me Imla's son Micaiah quickly."
111Kg 22:10 Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were each sitting on their respective thrones, arrayed in their robes, on the threshing floor at the entrance to the city gate of Samaria, and all of the prophets were prophesying in front of them. 
111Kg 22:11 Chenaanah's son Zedekiah made iron horns for himself and told them, "This is what the Lord says, 'With these horns you are to gore the Arameans until they are eliminated!'"
111Kg 22:12 All the other prophets were saying similar things, like "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and you will be successful, because the Lord will hand it over to the king!"
111Kg 22:13 Meanwhile, the messenger who had gone off to summon Micaiah advised him, "Look, everything that the other prophets were saying was unanimously favorable to the king. So please, cooperate with them and speak favorably."
111Kg 22:14 "As the Lord lives," Micaiah replied, "I'll say what my God tells me to say."
111Kg 22:15 When Micaiah approached the king, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I not?" "Go to war," Micaiah replied, "and you will be successful, because the Lord will hand it over to the king!"
111Kg 22:16 When he heard this, the king asked him, "How many times do I have to make you swear to tell me nothing but the truth?Now do it in the name of the Lord!"
111Kg 22:17 So Micaiah replied£º I saw all of Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord told me, 'These have no master, so let them each return to his own home in peace.'"
111Kg 22:18 Then the king of Israel told Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he wouldn't prophesy anything good about me, but only evil?"
111Kg 22:19 But Micaiah responded, "Therefore, listen to what the Lord has to say. I saw the Lord, sitting on his throne, and the entire Heavenly Army was standing around him on his right hand and on his left hand.
111Kg 22:20 "The Lord asked, 'Who will tempt King Ahab of Israel to attack Ramoth-gilead, so that he will die there?' And one was saying one thing and one was saying another.
111Kg 22:21 "But then a spirit approached, stood in front of the Lord, and said, 'I will entice him.'
111Kg 22:22 "And the Lord asked him, 'How?' "'I will go,' he announced, 'and I will be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all of his prophets!' "So the Lord said, 'You're just the one to deceive him. You will be successful. Go and do it.'
111Kg 22:23 "Now therefore, listen! The Lord has placed a lying spirit in the mouth of all of these prophets of yours, because the Lord has determined to bring disaster upon you."
111Kg 22:24 Right then, Chenaanah's son Zedekiah approached Micaiah and struck him on the cheek. Then he asked him, "How did the Spirit of the Lord move from me to speak to you?"
111Kg 22:25 Micaiah replied, "You'll see how when the day comes that you run away to hide yourself in a closet!"
111Kg 22:26 Then the king of Israel ordered, "Take Micaiah and place him in the custody of Amon, the city governor. Hand him over to Joash, the king's son. 
111Kg 22:27 Give him this order£º 'Place him in prison on survival rations of bread and water only until I come back safely.'"
111Kg 22:28 "If you return alive," Micaiah responded, "then the Lord has not spoken by me." Then he added, "Listen, all you people!"
111Kg 22:29 So the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah both attacked Ramoth-gilead. 
111Kg 22:30 The king of Israel suggested to Jehoshaphat, "I'll go into battle in disguise, but you keep your royal uniform on." So the king of Israel disguised himself and they both went into the battle.
111Kg 22:31 Meanwhile, the king of Aram had issued these orders to 32 of his chariot commanders£º "Don't attack unimportant soldiers or ranking officers. Go after only the king of Israel."
111Kg 22:32 So when the chariot commanders observed Jehoshaphat, they said by mistake, "It's the king of Israel!" and they turned aside to attack him. But Jehoshaphat cried out. 
111Kg 22:33 When the chariot commanders saw that their target was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.
111Kg 22:34 Meanwhile, somebody drew his bow aimlessly and struck the king of Israel between the scales where his armor breastplates joined, so he instructed his chariot driver, "Turn around and take me out of the battle, because I've been severely wounded." 
111Kg 22:35 The battle continued on for the rest of the day while the king of Israel was propped up in front of the Arameans until the sun set, at which time he died. The blood from Ahab's wound ran down into the bottom of the chariot.
111Kg 22:36 As the day drew to a close, this order was circulated throughout the army telling the soldiers, "Everybody go back to his city and to his own land." 
111Kg 22:37 So the king died and was brought back to Samaria, and they buried the king in Samaria. 
111Kg 22:38 They washed the chariot by the reservoir of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood near where the prostitutes went to bathe, in keeping with the message that the Lord had spoken.
111Kg 22:39 Now as to the rest of Ahab's accomplishments, everything that he undertook, the ivory palace he built, and the cities that he built, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
111Kg 22:40 That's how Ahab died, just as his ancestors had, and his son Ahaziah became king in his place.
111Kg 22:41 Asa's son Jehoshaphat became king over Judah during the fourth year of the reign of King Ahab of Israel. 
111Kg 22:42 Jehoshaphat was 35 years old when he became king. He reigned 25 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Azubah. She was the daughter of Shilhi. 
111Kg 22:43 He lived like his father Asa and never abandoned that life. He did what the Lord considered to be right. Nevertheless, the high places were not demolished, and the people continued to sacrifice and burn incense on the high places. 
111Kg 22:44 Jehoshaphat also made a peace treaty with the king of Israel.
111Kg 22:45 Now the rest of Jeshoshaphat's accomplishments, the power that he demonstrated, and how he waged war are written in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not?
111Kg 22:46 He also eliminated the male cult prostitutes who still remained from the time of his father Asa.
111Kg 22:47 There was no king reigning in Edom; there was only a stand-in king. 
111Kg 22:48 Jehoshaphat had ocean-going vessels from Tarshish sail to Ophir for gold, but they never made it because they were shipwrecked at Ezion-geber. 
111Kg 22:49 Ahab's son Ahaziah had offered to go. "Let my servants go with your servants in the ships!" he said. But Jehoshaphat was not willing. 
111Kg 22:50 Later, Jehoshaphat died, as did his ancestors, and he was buried alongside his ancestors in the city of David. Jehoram his son became king in his place.
111Kg 22:51 Ahab's son Ahaziah became king over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. He reigned for two years over Israel. 
111Kg 22:52 He practiced what the Lord considered to be evil by living life like his father and mother did. He lived like Nebat's son Jeroboam, who led Israel into sin. 
111Kg 22:53 He served Baal, worshipped him, and provoked the Lord God of Israel to anger, in accordance with everything his father had done.
12
122Kg 1:1 Moab rebelled against Israel after Ahab died. 
122Kg 1:2 Meanwhile, Ahaziah had fallen through the lattice in his upper room in Samaria and lay injured. He sent messengers to Ekron with these orders£º "Go and consult with Ekron's god Baal-zebub to find out if I'm going to recover from this injury."
122Kg 1:3 But the angel of the Lord spoke to Elijah the foreigner, "Get up and go meet the messengers from the king of Samaria. Ask them 'Is it because there is no God in Israel that you're going to consult with Ekron's god Baal-zebub?
122Kg 1:4 Now therefore this is what the Lord says£º "You won't be getting up from that bed of yours on which you're lying. You will most certainly die!"'" So Elijah got up and went.
122Kg 1:5 The messengers returned to the king and he asked them, "What's this?You've come back?"
122Kg 1:6 They replied, "We met a man who told us, 'Go back to the king who sent you and ask him, "Is it because there is no God in Israel that you're going to consult with Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron?Therefore you won't be getting up from that bed on which you're lying. You will most certainly die!"'" He told them, "Describe the man who met y ou and told you these things."
122Kg 1:8 They answered, "The man was a hairy fellow. He wore a leather sash around his waist." The king responded, "It's Elijah, that foreigner!"
122Kg 1:9 So the king sent out 50 men, along with their leader. The leader approached Elijah, who was sitting at the top of a hill. He ordered Elijah, "Hey, man of God! The king orders you to come down!"
122Kg 1:10 Elijah responded to the leader who was in charge of the 50 soldiers, "So I'm a man of God, am I?If so, may fire fall from heaven and devour you and your 50 soldiers¡¦" Just then, fire fell from heaven and devoured that leader and his 50 soldiers.
122Kg 1:11 Later the king tried again - he sent another company of 50 soldiers, along with their leader, who ordered Elijah, "Hey, man of God! This is what the king orders£º 'Come down!'"
122Kg 1:12 Elijah responded to the leader and to his entire company, "So I'm a man of God, am I?If so, may fire fall from heaven and devour you and your 50 soldiers¡¦" Just then, fire fell from heaven and devoured him and his 50 soldiers.
122Kg 1:13 Then the king tried yet again! The king sent a third company of 50 soldiers along with their leader. The third leader went up the hill, approached Elijah, fell on his knees in front of him, and begged him, "Hey, man of God, please treat my life and the lives of these servants of yours as precious! 
122Kg 1:14 Look how fire fell from heaven and devoured the two other companies of 50 soldiers, along with their captains, but now please treat me as if my life were precious!"
122Kg 1:15 The angel of the Lord told Elijah, "Go down the hill with that man. Don't be afraid of him!" So Elijah got up and went down with him to meet the king.
122Kg 1:16 Then Elijah spoke to the king, "This is what the Lord says£º 'Since you sent messengers to consult with Baal-zebub, the god of Ekron - is it because there is no God in Israel with whom to consult regarding his word -  - therefore you're not getting up from the bed on which you're lying. You certainly will die!'"     
122Kg 1:17 And die he did, just as the Lord had said and just as Elijah had spoken! After this, Jehoram ascended to the throne during the second year of the reign of Jehoshaphat's son Jehoram from Judah. He took the place of Ahaziah, who had no son. 
122Kg 1:18 The rest of Ahaziah's activities are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not - 
122Kg 2:1 As the time drew near when the Lord was about to take Elijah to heaven in a wind storm, Elijah and Elisha were on their way from Gilgal. 
122Kg 2:2 Elijah instructed Elisha, "Remain here on this side, please, because the Lord is sending me as far as Bethel." But Elisha replied, "As the Lord lives, I'm not going to leave you while you're still alive!" So they both went on to Bethel.
122Kg 2:3 When the Guild of Prophets who lived in Bethel came out to greet Elisha, they asked him, "You are aware, aren't you, that later today the Lord is going to remove your master from being your mentor?"Of course I'm aware of it," he said. "Calm down."
122Kg 2:4 Elijah also spoke to him, "Elisha, remain here on this side, please, because the Lord is sending me to Jericho." But Elisha responded, "As the Lord lives, and while you're still alive, I'm not going to leave you!" So they went to Jericho.
122Kg 2:5 The Guild of Prophets who lived in Jericho approached Elisha and asked him, "You are aware, aren't you, that later today the Lord is going to remove your master from being your mentor?"Of course I'm aware of it," he said. "Calm down."
122Kg 2:6 Elijah also spoke to him, "Elisha, remain here on this side, please, because the Lord is sending me to the Jordan River." But Elisha responded, "As the Lord lives, and while you're still alive, I'm not going to leave you!" So they went on their way, 
122Kg 2:7 accompanied by 50 men from the Guild of Prophets, who stood at a short distance from them while they were both standing by the Jordan. 
122Kg 2:8 Elijah took off his ornamented cloak, wrapped it up in a roll, struck the water, and all of a sudden the water divided into two parts! One side of the river stood still opposite the other until the two of them crossed over on dry ground.
122Kg 2:9 When they had crossed the Jordan River, Elijah invited Elisha, "Ask me what you want me to do for you before I'm taken away from you." So Elisha asked, "Please, may there be a double portion of your spirit upon me!"
122Kg 2:10 "That's a hard thing to ask for," Elijah answered, "but if you see me while I'm being taken from you, it will happen for you. But if you don't see me, it won't happen."
122Kg 2:11 As they continued on, talking as they went, suddenly chariots blazing with fire and pulled by fiery horses appeared, separated the two of them, and Elijah ascended in a wind storm to heaven! 
122Kg 2:12 As Elisha continued to watch, he cried out, "My father! My father! The chariots of Israel and its cavalry!" Then he did not see Elijah any more. After this, Elisha gripped his clothes that he was wearing, tore them apart into two pieces, 
122Kg 2:13 picked up Elijah's ornamented cloak that had fallen from him, and went back to stand on the bank of the Jordan River. 
122Kg 2:14 Elisha took hold of Elijah's ornamental cloak that had been left behind, struck the water, and cried out£º "Where is the Lord God of Elijah?" All of a sudden, after he had struck the water, the water divided into two parts! One side of the river stood opposite the other, and Elijah crossed over.
122Kg 2:15 As soon as the Guild of Prophets who lived adjacent to Jericho saw Elisha, they began to announce, "The spirit of Elijah is at rest on Elisha!" So they came out to meet him and they greeted him by bowing low to the ground in front of him.
122Kg 2:16 Then they asked Elisha, "Look! We have 50 valiant men here with your servant! Please let them go out and search for your master Elijah. Perhaps the Spirit of the Lord has taken him up on a mountain or into a valley." Elisha responded, "Don't bother searching."
122Kg 2:17 But they persisted until he was frustrated, so he said, "Send them out!" So they sent out the 50 men, and they looked around for three days but did not find Elijah. 
122Kg 2:18 By the time they returned, Elisha was living in Jericho. Then Elisha asked them, "Didn't I tell you not to go?"
122Kg 2:19 The men who lived in the city addressed Elisha. "Look now," they said, "our city's location is good, as you have been observing, but the water springs here are bad and the land isn't sustaining crops."
122Kg 2:20 Elisha ordered them, "Bring me a new bowl and put some salt in it." So they brought him what he had requested.
122Kg 2:21 Elisha went out to the springs, threw the salt into them, and declared, "This is what the Lord says£º 'I have purified these waters. Neither death nor barrenness shall flow from them any more.'" 
122Kg 2:22 As a result, the water springs remain pure to this day, just as Elisha had declared.
122Kg 2:23 Later, Elisha left there to go up to Bethel, and as he was traveling along the road, some insignificant young men came from the city and started mocking him. They told him, "Get on up, baldy! Get on up, baldy!" 
122Kg 2:24 He looked behind him, took note of the young men, and cursed them in the name of the Lord. Suddenly two female bears emerged from the woods and mauled 42 of the young men. 
122Kg 2:25 After this, he left from there to go to Mt. Carmel, and from there he went back to Samaria.
122Kg 3:1 Ahab's son Jehoram ascended to the throne of Israel at Samaria during the eighteenth year of the reign of Judah's king Jehoshaphat. He reigned for twelve years, 
122Kg 3:2 practicing evil in the Lord's presence, only not to the extent that his mother and father had done - he forced abolition of the sacred pillar to Baal that his father had crafted. 
122Kg 3:3 Even so, he kept on committing the sins that Nebat's son Jeroboam had done, which ensnared Israel in sin - he never abandoned them.1
122Kg 3:4 Meanwhile, Moab's king Mesha was a sheep breeder. He used to pay 100,000 lambs and the wool from 100,000 rams to the king of Israel as tribute. 
122Kg 3:5 After Ahab died, the king of Moab rebelled against the king of Israel. 
122Kg 3:6 So king Jehoram left Samaria at that time and mustered the entire army of Israel. 
122Kg 3:7 As he was going out, he sent this message to King Jehoshaphat of Judah£º "The king of Moab has rebelled against me. Will you go with me to fight Moab?"I'm coming," Jehoshaphat replied. "I'm like you! My army will act like your army and my cavalry like your cavalry," Then Jehoshaphat added£º 
122Kg 3:8 "What road do we take?" Jehoram answered, "We'll go along the Edom desert road."
122Kg 3:9 So the king of Israel, the king of Judah, and the king of Edom made a complete circuit on the road for seven days, but there was no water for the army or for the livestock that accompanied them.
122Kg 3:10 Then the king of Israel remarked, "Oh no! The Lord has summoned us three kings so he can hand us over to Moab, hasn't he?"
122Kg 3:11 Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there a prophet who belongs to the Lord and through whom we can ask the Lord a question?" One of the king of Israel's attendants replied, "Shaphat's son Elisha lives here. He used to be Elijah's personal attendant."
122Kg 3:12 Jehoshaphat answered, "He has the word of the Lord." So the king of Israel, Jehoshaphat, and the king of Edom went to visit Elisha.
122Kg 3:13 Elisha asked the king of Israel, "What do I have in common with you?Go visit your parents' prophets." The king of Israel replied, "No! The Lord has summoned these three kings so he can hand them over to Moab!"
122Kg 3:14 But Elisha responded, "As the Lord of the Heavenly Armies lives, in whose presence I stand, I would never pay attention to you or even look in your direction were it not for my continual respect for the presence of King Jehoshaphat of Judah. 
122Kg 3:15 Now bring me a musician." As the musician played, the hand of the Lord rested on Elisha, 
122Kg 3:16 so he said, "This is what the Lord says£º 'Fill this valley with trench after trench!' For this is what the Lord says£º 'Though you won't see wind or storm, nevertheless that river will overflow with water so that you, your cattle, and your livestock may drink.' 
122Kg 3:18 And this is the easy part for the Lord - he's also going to hand the Moabites over to you! 
122Kg 3:19 Then you are to attack every fortified city and every significant city. Cut down every significant tree, fill in all of the water springs, and ruin every prime piece of land with stones."
122Kg 3:20 The very next day, about the time of the morning offering, water suddenly appeared, coming from the direction of Edom, and the land overflowed with water! 
122Kg 3:21 Meanwhile, all the Moabites heard that the kings had come up to attack them, so everyone old enough to wear battle armor was mustered to stand guard at the border. 
122Kg 3:22 As the Moabites arose early that morning, the sun cast its rays on the water, and to the Moabites, the water across from them appeared to be red like blood. 
122Kg 3:23 So they concluded, "This must be blood! The kings must have had one mighty big fight and each man killed the other! So let's go get the battle spoil, Moab!"
122Kg 3:24 But when the Moabites arrived at the Israelite encampment, the Israelites got up and attacked them. The Moabites ran away from the Israelites, who followed them into the land as they continued their pursuit against Moab. 
122Kg 3:25 They destroyed their cities, and all of them threw stones onto every piece of farm land, ruining the fields. Then they filled in all the water wells and chopped down all of the useful trees. Stone walls remained surrounding Kir-hareseth only, until the archers surrounded and attacked that city. 
122Kg 3:26 When the king of Moab realized that the battle was going strongly against him, he took 700 expert swordsmen to attempt to break through to the king of Edom, but was unable to do so. 
122Kg 3:27 So he took his first born son, whom he intended to reign after him, and offered him up as a burnt offering on the wall. There subsequently came great anger against Israel, so they abandoned the attack and returned to their homeland.324
122Kg 4:1 Now there happened to be a certain woman who had been the wife of a member of the Guild of Prophets. She cried out to Elisha, "My husband who served you has died, and you know that your servant feared the Lord. But a creditor has come to take away my children into indentured servitude!"
122Kg 4:2 Elisha responded, "What shall I do for you?Tell me what you have in your house?" She replied, "Your servant has nothing in the entire house except for a flask of oil."
122Kg 4:3 He told her, "Go out to all of your neighbors in the surrounding streets and borrow lots of pots from them. Don't get just a few empty vessels, either. 
122Kg 4:4 Then go in and shut the door behind you, taking only your children, and pour oil into all of the pots. As each one is filled, set it aside."
122Kg 4:5 So she left Elisha, shut the door behind her and her children, and while they kept on bringing vessels to her, she kept on pouring oil. 
122Kg 4:6 When the last of the vessels had been filled, she told her son, "Bring me another pot!" But he replied, "There isn't even one pot left." Then the oil stopped flowing. 
122Kg 4:7 After this, she went and told the man of God what had happened. So he said, "Go sell the oil, pay your debt, and you and your children will be able to live on the proceeds."
122Kg 4:8 Some time later, Elisha went to Shunem, where he met a prominent and wealthy woman who persuaded him to have a meal with her. As a result, whenever he was in the area, he stopped by to eat with her. 
122Kg 4:9 So she had a talk with her husband. "Look here! I've learned that this is a holy and godly man who comes by here on a regular basis. 
122Kg 4:10 Now then, let's build a small upper room and put a bed in it for him there, along with a table, a chair, and a lamp stand. That way, when he comes to visit, he can rest there."
122Kg 4:11 One day Elisha came by to visit and stopped in to rest in the upper chamber. 
122Kg 4:12 He told his attendant Gehazi, "Call this Shunammite." So when he had summoned her, she stood in front of him.
122Kg 4:13 Elisha told him, "Ask her, 'Look how you've gone to all this trouble to care for us! What can I do for you?Do you wish to be mentioned to the king or to the head of the army?" She replied, "I'm at home living among my own people."
122Kg 4:14 He responded, "What, then, is to be done on her behalf?" Gehazi answered, "Well, she has no son and her husband is growing old."
122Kg 4:15 "Call her," Elisha ordered. After he called her, she came and stood in the doorway, 
122Kg 4:16 and he told her, "About this time next year you will be embracing a son." "No, sir! Please, as a godly man, don't mislead your servant!" 
122Kg 4:17 But the woman did conceive and did bear a son at that very same time the next year, just as Elisha had told her.
122Kg 4:18 After the child had grown up a bit, one day he went out to visit his father, who was with the harvesters. 
122Kg 4:19 He told his father, "My head! My head!" So his father ordered his servant, "Carry him over to his mother!" 
122Kg 4:20 So the servant carried him over to his mother, where he rested on her lap until mid-day, and then he died. 
122Kg 4:21 The woman went upstairs, laid him on the bed belonging to the man of God, and shut the door, leaving him behind as she left.
122Kg 4:22 Then she called to her husband and asked him, "Please send me one of the servants, along with one of the donkeys, so I can ride quickly to see that godly man. I'll be right back."
122Kg 4:23 He asked her, "What's the point of visiting him today?It's not a new moon, and it isn't the Sabbath!" But she kept saying, "Things will go well."
122Kg 4:24 So she saddled a donkey and told her servant, "Forward, driver! Don't slow down on my account, unless I tell you!" 
122Kg 4:25 So out she went and eventually she arrived at Mount Carmel to visit the man of God. When the man of God noticed her from a distance, he told his attendant Gehazi, "Look! There's the woman from Shunem! 
122Kg 4:26 Please run out quickly and greet her. Ask her, 'Are things going well with you?Are things going well with your husband?Are things going well with your child?'" She answered Gehazi, "Things are going well."
122Kg 4:27 As she came near the man of God on the mountain, she grabbed his feet. When Gehazi intervened to push her away, the man of God said, "Leave her alone! She is deeply troubled! The Lord has concealed the thing from me, and hasn't informed me."
122Kg 4:28 Then she asked, "Did I ask my lord for a son?Didn't I beg you, 'Don't mislead me?'"
122Kg 4:29 At this he said to Gehazi, "Get ready to run! Take my staff in your hand, and get on the road. Don't greet anyone you meet. If anyone greets you, don't respond. Just go lay my staff on the youngster's face."
122Kg 4:30 At this the youngster's mother replied, "As long as you and the Lord live, I'm not leaving you!" So he got up and followed her.
122Kg 4:31 Meanwhile, Gehazi went on ahead of them and placed the staff on the youngster's face, but when there was no sound or reaction, he returned, met Elisha, and told him, "The youngster has shown no sign of awakening."
122Kg 4:32 When Elisha entered the house, there was the youngster, dead and laid out on Elisha's bed! 
122Kg 4:33 So he entered, shut the door behind them both, and prayed to the Lord. 
122Kg 4:34 Then he approached the child and lay down with his mouth near the child's, with his eyes near those of the child, and taking the child's hands in his. As Elisha stretched himself on the child, the child's flesh began to grow warm. 
122Kg 4:35 Then he went downstairs, walked around back and forth inside the house once, went back up to his upper chamber, and stretched himself over the child again. The young man sneezed seven times and then opened his eyes.
122Kg 4:36 He called out to Gehazi, "Go get the Shunammite woman!" So he called her. 37When she came in to see Elisha, he told her, "Take back your son!" 
122Kg 4:37 Then she approached him, fell at his feet, bowing low to the ground, took back her son, and went out.
122Kg 4:38 Elisha returned to Gilgal during a time of famine in the land. While the Guild of Prophets were having a meal with him, he instructed his attendant, "Put a large pot on the fire and boil some stew for the Guild of Prophets." 
122Kg 4:39 Somebody went out into the fields to grab some herbs, found a wild vine, and gathered a lap full of wild gourds, which he came and sliced up into the stew pot, but nobody else knew.
122Kg 4:40 When they served the men, they began to eat the stew. But they cried out, "That pot of stew is deadly, you man of God!" So they couldn't eat the stew.
122Kg 4:41 But he replied, "Bring me some flour." He tossed it into the pot and said, "Serve the people so they can eat." Then there was nothing harmful in the pot.
122Kg 4:42 Later on, a man arrived from Baal-shalishah, bringing the man of God some bread as a first fruit offering. He had 20 loaves of barley and ripe ears of corn in his sack. So Elisha said, "Give them to the people so they can eat." 4
122Kg 4:43 Elisha's attendant asked, "What?Will this serve 100 men?" But he replied, "Distribute it to the people so they can eat, because this is what the Lord says£º 'They will eat and have a surplus!'" 
122Kg 4:44 So he served them, and they ate and had some left over, just as the Lord had indicated.
122Kg 5:1 Naaman, the commander of the army of the king of Aram, was a great man in the opinion of his master. He was highly favored, because by him the Lord had given victory to Aram. Though he was a mighty and valiant man, he was suffering from leprosy. 
122Kg 5:2 On one of their raids to the territory of Israel, Aram had taken captive a young girl when she was an infant, who had eventually become an attendant to Naaman's wife. 
122Kg 5:3 She mentioned to her mistress, "If only my master were to visit the prophet who is in Samaria! He would cure him of his leprosy."
122Kg 5:4 Later, Naaman went to inform his master and told him something like this£º "Thus and so spoke the young woman from the territory of Israel."
122Kg 5:5 The king of Aram replied, "Go now, and I'll send a letter to the king of Israel." So he left and took with him ten talents of silver and 6,000 units of gold, along with ten sets of clothing. 
122Kg 5:6 He also brought the letter to the king of Israel, which read as follows£º "¡¦and now as this letter finds its way to you, look! I've sent my servant Naaman to you so you may heal him of his leprosy."
122Kg 5:7 When the king of Israel read the letter, he ripped his clothes and cried out, "Am I God?Can I kill and give life?Is this man sending me a request to heal a man's leprosy?Let's think about this - he's looking for a reason to start a fight with me!"
122Kg 5:8 When Elisha the man of God heard that the king of Israel had torn his clothes, he sent a message to the king and asked, "Why did you tear your clothes?Please, let the man come visit me and he will learn that there is a prophet in Israel!"
122Kg 5:9 So Naaman arrived with his horses and chariots and stood in front of the door to Elisha's house. 
122Kg 5:10 Elisha sent a messenger out to him, who told him, "Go bathe in the Jordan River seven times. Your flesh will be restored for you. Now stay clean!"
122Kg 5:11 But Naaman flew into a rage and left, telling himself, "Look! I thought 'He's surely going to come out to me, stand still, call out in the name of the Lord his God, wave his hand over the infection, and cure the leprosy!' 
122Kg 5:12 Aren't the Abanah and Pharpar rivers in Damascus better than all of the water in Israel?Couldn't I just bathe in them and become clean?" So he turned away and left, filled with anger.
122Kg 5:13 But then his servants approached him and spoke with him. They said, "My father, had the prophet only asked of you something great, you would have done it, wouldn't you?Yet he said to you, 'Bathe, and be clean¡¦!' 
122Kg 5:14 So he went down and plunged himself into the Jordan River seven times, just as the man of God had said, and his flesh rejuvenated like the flesh of a newborn child. And he was clean.
122Kg 5:15 Naaman went back to the man of God, along with his entire entourage, and stood before him. "Please look!" he said. "I know that there is no God in all the earth, except in Israel! So please, take a present from your servant."
122Kg 5:16 But Elisha replied, "As the Lord lives, before whom I stand, I will not receive anything from you." Though Naaman urged him to take it, Elisha declined.
122Kg 5:17 So Naaman asked, "No?Then please let your servant load two mules with dirt from Israel, because your servant will no longer offer any burnt offering or sacrifice to any other god but the Lord. 
122Kg 5:18 In this one area may the Lord pardon your servant£º Whenever my master enters the temple of Rimmon to worship there, he will lean on my hand while I bow down in the temple of Rimmon. So may the Lord pardon your servant in this one area."
122Kg 5:19 "Go in peace," he said. So Naaman left. After Naaman had gone only a short distance, 
122Kg 5:20 Gehazi, the attendant to Elisha the man of God, said to himself, "Look how my master has spared this Aramean Naaman! He declined to take from him what he brought. As the Lord lives, I'm going to run after him and get something from him." 
122Kg 5:21 So Gehazi ran after Naaman. When Naaman noticed someone running after him, he came down from his chariot, greeted him and asked, "Is everything all right?"
122Kg 5:22 Gehazi said, "Everything's all right. My master sent me to tell you, 'Just now two men from the Guild of Prophets have arrived from the hill country of Ephraim. Please give them a talent of silver bullion and two sets of clothes.'"
122Kg 5:23 But Naaman said, "Please accept my invitation to take two talents of silver bullion." He urged him, binding two talents of silver bullion in two bags, along with two sets of clothes. He placed them in the care of two of his young men, and they went on ahead of Gehazi. 
122Kg 5:24 When he arrived at the stronghold, Gehazi took the bags from their custody and hid them away in the house. Then he sent the men away and they left.5
122Kg 5:25 Later he went to address his master. Elisha asked him, "Where did you go, Gehazi?" "Your servant went nowhere in particular," he said.
122Kg 5:26 But Elisha responded, "Didn't my heart break as the man was turning from his chariot to greet you?Is now the time to receive money?To receive clothes?And olive groves, vineyards, sheep, oxen, servants, or female attendants?
122Kg 5:27 Naaman's leprosy will plague you and your descendants forever!" As he left Elisha's presence, he was infected with leprosy that looked like white snow.
122Kg 6:1 One day the Guild of Prophets said to Elisha, "Notice how the place where we are living is too small for us. 
122Kg 6:2 Let's go to the Jordan River, fashion some rafters,  and build a place for us so we can live there." So he said, "Go!" 
122Kg 6:3 Someone said "Would you be willing to come with your servants?" "I'm willing," he replied 
122Kg 6:4 So he accompanied them, and when they came to the Jordan River they cut down some trees.
122Kg 6:5 It happened that as one of them was felling a beam, his axe head fell into the water. He cried out, "Oh no! Master! The axe was on loan to me!"
122Kg 6:6 The man of God asked, "Where did it fall?" When he was shown the place, he cut off a branch, tossed it there, and made the iron axe head float. 
122Kg 6:7 Then Elisha said, "Pick it up!" So the young man reached out and picked it up.
122Kg 6:8 Eventually the king of Aram went to war against Israel, taking counsel with his advisors and concluding, "In such and such a place I'll build my encampment."
122Kg 6:9 So the man of God sent a message to the king of Israel, warning him, "Keep an eye on that area, because the Arameans are going to be there!" 
122Kg 6:10 The king of Israel confirmed the matter about which the man of God had warned him. Having been forewarned, he was able to protect himself there on more than one or two occasions.9
122Kg 6:11 The king of Aram flew into a rage over this, so he called in his advisors and asked them, "Will you please tell me which of us has joined the king of Israel?"
122Kg 6:12 "No, your majesty!" One of his servants said. "Elisha the prophet, who lives in Israel, tells the king of Israel what you talk about in your bedroom!"
122Kg 6:13 So the king ordered, "Go and discover where he is, so I may send men to take him into custody." Later somebody told him, "Look! He's in Dothan!"
122Kg 6:14 So the king of Aram sent out horses, chariots, and an elite force, and they arrived during the night and surrounded the city. 
122Kg 6:15 Meanwhile, the attendant to the man of God got up early in the morning and went outside, and there were the elite forces, surrounding the city, accompanied by horses and chariots! So Elisha's attendant cried out to him, "Oh no! Master! What shall we do!?"
122Kg 6:16 Elisha replied, "Stop being afraid, because there are more with us than with them!" 
122Kg 6:17 Then Elisha prayed, asking the Lord, "Please make him able to really see!" And so when the Lord enabled the young man to see, and he looked, and there was the mountain, filled with horses and fiery chariots surrounding Elisha!
122Kg 6:18 When the army approached him, Elisha spoke to the Lord, asking him, "Lord, I'm asking you please to afflict this group of people with blindness!" So he afflicted them with blindness, just as Elisha had asked.
122Kg 6:19 Then Elisha told the army, "This isn't the way, and this isn't the city! Follow me, and I'll bring you to the man you're seeking. Then he led them to Samaria. 
122Kg 6:20 When they arrived in Samaria, Elisha asked the Lord, "Enable them to see again." So the Lord did so, and there they were - right in the middle of Samaria!
122Kg 6:21 When the king of Israel saw Elisha, he asked him "Shall I execute them, my father!"
122Kg 6:22 But he replied, "No! You're not to kill them! Would you execute those whom you've taken captive at the point of a sword or with your bow?Give them food and water so they can eat and drink. Then send them back to their master!" 
122Kg 6:23 So he prepared a large feast for them, and when they had finished eating and drinking, he sent them back to their master, and marauding gangs of Arameans never came into the territory of Israel again.
122Kg 6:24 Some time later, King Ben-hadad from Aram mustered his army, invaded the land, and attacked Samaria 
122Kg 6:25 until there was a great famine throughout Samaria. The siege lasted until a donkey's head cost 80 silver coins and one quarter of a unit of dove's dung cost five silver coins.
122Kg 6:26 While the king of Israel was walking along the city wall, a woman cried out to him. "Help me, your majesty!" she said.
122Kg 6:27 He replied, "No! Since the Lord won't give you victory, how will I be able to deliver you?From the threshing floor?From the wine press?" 
122Kg 6:28 Then the king asked her, "What's bothering you?" She said, "This woman told me, 'Give up your son, and we'll eat him today, and we'll eat your son tomorrow.'" 
122Kg 6:29 So we boiled my son and ate him. The next day, I told her, 'Give me your son so we can eat him!' But she has hidden her son!"
122Kg 6:30 When the king heard what the woman said, he ripped his garments as he continued walking along the city wall. As the people watched, all of a sudden they noticed he was wearing sackcloth underneath his clothes, inside next to his flesh! 
122Kg 6:31 He said, "May God do to me - and more also! - if the head of Shaphat's son Elisha remains on his shoulders today!"
122Kg 6:32 Meanwhile, Elisha was sitting in his house, along with the elders, when the king sent a man to kill him, but before the messenger arrived, Elisha said to the elders, "Are you watching how this descendant of murderers has ordered my head be cut off?Look, when the messenger arrives, shut the door and hold it to shut them out! Don't you hear the sound of his master's feet right behind him?"
122Kg 6:33 While he was still talking with them, the messenger arrived to see him and delivered the king's message to Elisha, "Look! This evil has come from the Lord! Why should I wait for the Lord any more?"
122Kg 7:1 So Elisha responded, "Listen to this message from the Lord! 'This is what the Lord says£º "At about this time tomorrow in Samaria's city gate a seah of finely ground flour will sell for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel."'"
122Kg 7:2 But the royal attendant on whom the king depended responded to the man of God£º "Look here! Even if the Lord were to open a window in the sky, how could this happen?" He replied, "No, you look! You'll see it with your eyes, but you won't eat any of it!"
122Kg 7:3 Now there happened to be four lepers who were at that very moment at the entrance to the city gate. As they were talking with one another, they said, "Why are we sitting here waiting to die?
122Kg 7:4 If we tell ourselves, 'Let's remain in the city,' we'll die there since there's famine in the city. But if we sit here, we'll die, too. So let's go over to the Arameans! If they spare our lives, we'll live, and if they kill us¡¦we're dying anyway!"
122Kg 7:5 So they got up at dusk and went out to the Aramean encampment. But when they arrived at the outskirts of the Aramean encampment, there was no one there! 
122Kg 7:6 The Lord had made the Aramean army hear the sounds of chariots, horses, and a large army, so they told one another, "Look! The king of Israel has hired the kings of the Hittites and the Egyptians to come attack us!" 
122Kg 7:7 So the Arameans got up and ran away in the gathering darkness. They left behind their tents, horses, and donkeys just as they were - and fled for their lives!
122Kg 7:8 When the lepers arrived at the outskirts of the encampment, they entered one tent and ate and drank. Then they carried off from there some silver, gold, and clothes, and went out and hid them. After this they returned, entered another tent, raided it, and went and hid all of that, too! 
122Kg 7:9 But then they said to each other. "We're not doing the right thing. This is a day of good news, but if we keep quiet until morning, we're sure to be punished! So let's leave and go tell the king's household!" 
122Kg 7:10 So they left, called out to the city gatekeepers, and reported to them£º "We went out to the Aramean encampment, and there was nobody there! Not even the sound of men - only horses and donkeys tied up, and tents left just as they were!"
122Kg 7:11 The gatekeepers announced the report to the king's attendants, 
122Kg 7:12 so the king got up in the middle of the night and ordered his servants£º "Let me explain what the Arameans have done to us. They know that we're hungry, so they've left their encampment to conceal themselves in the surrounding fields. They're telling themselves, 'When they come out of the city, we'll capture them alive and enter the city!'"
122Kg 7:13 One of his attendants suggested, "Please, let's take five of the remaining horses, since those who remain here will end up like the rest of Israel, which has already died, and we'll send them out to look." 
122Kg 7:14 So they took two chariots and horses, and the king sent them out after the Aramean army with the orders, "Go and look!" 713
122Kg 7:15 They went out in the direction of the Jordan River, and the entire roadway was strewn with clothes and equipment that the Arameans had abandoned in their haste to leave! So the messengers returned and reported to the king. 
122Kg 7:16 At this, the people went out and plundered the camp of the Arameans. At that time, a seah of finely ground flour was sold for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel, in accordance with the Lord's message.
122Kg 7:17 Meanwhile, the king appointed the same royal attendant on whom he depended to take control of the city gate, but the people trampled him to death in the gate, just as the man of God had told the king when the king came down to him. 
122Kg 7:18 It happened just as the man of God had spoken to the king£º "At about this time tomorrow in Samaria's city gate a seah of finely ground flour will sell for a shekel, and two seahs of barley for a shekel."
122Kg 7:19 But the royal attendant on whom the king depended responded to the man of God£º "Look here! Even if the Lord were to make a window in the sky, how could this happen?" He replied, "No, you look! You'll see it with your eyes, but you won't eat any of it!"
122Kg 7:20 And so it happened to him, because the people trampled him in the city gate and he died.
122Kg 8:1 Meanwhile, Elisha urged the woman whose son he had restored to life, "You must get up and leave with your household to go live wherever you can, because the Lord has called for a famine, and it's going to come over the land for seven years." 
122Kg 8:2 So the woman followed the instructions given to her by the man of God, and she went to the territory of the Philistines to live for seven years with her household. 
122Kg 8:3 At the end of the seven years, the woman returned from the territory of the Philistines and went to the king in order to file an appeal regarding her house and her grain field.
122Kg 8:4 The king was talking with Gehazi, the attendant of the man of God. He had asked Gehazi, "Please tell me about all of the great things that Elisha has done." 
122Kg 8:5 Just as he was telling the king about Elisha's having restored the dead to life, the woman whose son had been restored arrived and appealed to the king for her house and her land! Gehazi told the king, "Your majesty, this is the woman! And here's her son, whom Elisha restored to life!"
122Kg 8:6 The king consulted with the woman, who related the story. So the king appointed a court official to represent her and ordered him£º "Restore to her everything that belonged to her, including all of the produce that her fields yielded from the day she left the land until now."
122Kg 8:7 Later on, Elisha traveled to Damascus. King Ben-hadad of Aram was ill, but someone informed him, "The man of God has come here!"
122Kg 8:8 So the king told Hazael, "Take a gift with you and go meet the man of God. Inquire of the Lord through him and ask, 'Will I recover from this sickness.'"
122Kg 8:9 So Hazael went out to meet with him and took a gift with him - 40 camel loads filled with samples of everything good in Damascus. He approached the man of God and said, "Your son King Ben-hadad from Aram has sent me to you to ask you, 'Will I recover from this sickness?'"
122Kg 8:10 But Elisha told him, "Go tell him, 'You will certainly recover,' but the Lord has shown me that he will certainly die." 
122Kg 8:11 Then Elisha looked steadily at Hazael until Hazael grew ashamed, and then the man of God began to cry.
122Kg 8:12 "Why are you crying, sir?" Hazael asked. "Because I know the evil that you're about to bring on the Israelites," he replied. "You'll burn down their fortified cities, execute their young men with swords, dash to pieces their little ones, and you'll tear open their pregnant women!"
122Kg 8:13 But Hazael responded, "What?Who am I, your servant, that I should do such a horrible thing?" But Elisha answered, "The Lord has shown me that you will be king over Aram."
122Kg 8:14 So he left Elisha and returned to his master, who asked him, "What did Elisha tell you?" He replied, "He said to me that you would certainly get better."
122Kg 8:15 But the very next day, Hazael grabbed a thick covering, soaked it in water, and spread it over the king's face, and he suffocated. Then Hazael succeeded Ben-haddad as king.
122Kg 8:16 Sometime during the fifth year of the reign of Ahab's son Joram, king of Israel (while Jehoshaphat was still ruling as king of Judah), Jehoshaphat's son Jehoram ascended to the throne of Judah. 
122Kg 8:17 He was 32 years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for eight years. 
122Kg 8:18 He lived his life like the kings of Israel did, following the example of Ahab's household when he married Ahab's daughter and practiced what was evil in the Lord's presence. 
122Kg 8:19 But the Lord remained unwilling to destroy Judah for the sake of his servant David, since he had promised to keep David's lamp burning brightly through his descendants every day.17
122Kg 8:20 During Jehoram's lifetime, Edom rebelled from Judah's hegemony and appointed a king to rule over themselves. 
122Kg 8:21 Then Joram crossed over to Zair, along with all of his chariots. At night he attacked the Edomites who had surrounded him and the commanders of his chariots, but the army ran away to their tents. 
122Kg 8:22 Edom remains in rebellion against Judah to this day, and Libnah revolted at the same time. 
122Kg 8:23 The rest of the official acts of Joram, along with everything else that he did, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not - 
122Kg 8:24 After Joram was laid to rest with his ancestors in the city of David, his son Ahaziah replaced him as king. 
122Kg 8:25 Joram's son Ahaziah began to reign as king of Judah during the twelfth year of the reign of Ahab's son Joram, king of Israel. 
122Kg 8:26 Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for one year. His mother was named Athaliah. She was the granddaughter of Omri, king of Israel. 
122Kg 8:27 Ahaziah lived his life following the example of Ahab's household, practicing what the Lord considered to be evil, just like the household of Ahab, because he was a son-in-law to Ahab's household. 
122Kg 8:28 He joined Ahab's son Joram in an attack on King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth-gilead, and that's where the Arameans wounded Joram. 
122Kg 8:29 Then King Joram retreated to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that the Arameans had inflicted on him at Ramah during the battle against King Hazael of Aram. Jehoram's son Ahaziah, king of Judah, went to visit Ahab's son Joram in Jezreel because Joram was sick.
122Kg 9:1 Elisha called one of the members of the Guild of Prophets and told him, "Get ready to run, take this flask of oil in your hand, and go to Ramoth-gilead. 
122Kg 9:2 As soon as you get there, go find Jehoshaphat's son Jehu, the grandson of Nimshi. When you do, go in, tell him to get up and go apart with you away from his brothers. Lead him into a private chamber, 
122Kg 9:3 take the flask of oil, and pour it out on his head. Then tell him, 'This is what the Lord says£º I'm anointing you king over Israel.' Then open the door and leave. Don't linger there!"
122Kg 9:4 So the young man, who was an attendant to the prophet, went to Ramoth-gilead. 
122Kg 9:5 When he arrived, the army commanders were seated, so he said, "I have a message for you, captain!" Jehu asked, "For which one of us?" "For you, captain!" he answered.
122Kg 9:6 So Jehu got up and went inside the house, and the young man told him, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says£º 'I have anointed you king over the people of the Lord - that is, over Israel. 
122Kg 9:7 You are to attack the household of your master Ahab, so I may avenge the blood of my servants the prophets, as well as the blood of all of the servants of the Lord that has been spilled at Jezebel's orders. 
122Kg 9:8 The entire household of Ahab will die, and I will cut off from Ahab every male person in Israel, whether imprisoned or surviving. 
122Kg 9:9 I will make the household of Ahab like the household of Nebat's son Jeroboam and the household of Ahijah's son Baasha. 
122Kg 9:10 Furthermore, the dogs will eat Jezebel in the territory of Jezreel. There will be no burial for her.'" Then he opened the door and left.
122Kg 9:11 As Jehu was coming out to his master's attendants, one of them asked him, "Is everything all right?Why did this maniac visit you?" "You know the man and how he speculates," Jehu replied.
122Kg 9:12 "That's a lie!" they said. "Tell us what's going on!" "He said 'This and that' to me," he responded. "'This is what the Lord says£º "I have anointed you king over Israel."'"
122Kg 9:13 At this, each man quickly grabbed his own garment, placed it under him at the top of the stairs, sounded a trumpet, and announced, "Jehu is king!"
122Kg 9:14 Meanwhile, Jehoshaphat's son Jehu, the grandson of Nimshi had been conspiring against Joram while Joram and all the army of Israel had been defending Ramoth-gilead against King Hazael from Aram. 
122Kg 9:15 King Jehoram had returned to Jezreel to recover from wounds he had sustained from the Arameans when he had fought against King Hazael from Aram. So Jehu concluded, "Since this is what you've decided, then let no one get away, leave the city, and go report to Jezreel!" 
122Kg 9:16 Then Jehu rode by chariot to Jezreel, since Joram was recovering there. King Ahazaiah from Judah had come to visit Joram.15
122Kg 9:17 While the watchman was standing guard in the tower at Jezreel, he watched Jehu's entourage arrive. So he called out, "I see a group arriving." Joram ordered, "Take a horseman, send him out to meet them, and have him ask, 'Have you come in peace?'"
122Kg 9:18 So a horseman went out, greeted Jehu and said, "This is what the king said£º 'Have you come in peace?'" But Jehu responded, "What do you have to do with peace?Fall in behind me." The watchman reported, "The messenger arrived there, but he hasn't returned."
122Kg 9:19 Then Joram sent out a second horseman, who went out to them and said, "This is what the king said£º 'Have you come in peace?'" Jehu responded, "What do you have to do with peace?Fall in behind me."
122Kg 9:20 The watchman reported to Joram, "He arrived there, but he hasn't returned. Also, he drives like Nimshi's son Jehu drives - irrationally!"
122Kg 9:21 Joram replied, "Let's begin our attack!" As soon as his chariot was prepared, both King Joram of Israel and King Ahaziah of Judah went out, each in his own chariot, to fight against Jehu. They met together in the property that had belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite.
122Kg 9:22 As soon as Joram noticed Jehu, he cried out, "Peace, Jehu?" Jehu replied, "What peace, given your mother Jezebel's prostitution and all of her witchcraft?"
122Kg 9:23 Joram reined his horse around to flee and cried out to Ahaziah, "Ahaziah! Treachery!" 
122Kg 9:24 But Jehu drew his bow with all of his strength, shooting Joram between his shoulder blades. The arrow pierced his heart, and he collapsed in his chariot.
122Kg 9:25 After this, Jehu called out to Bidkar, his third in command, "Pick up Joram's body and throw it in the field, the property that belonged to Naboth the Jezreelite, because you and I remember how when we were riding together in pursuit of his father Ahab, that the Lord pronounced this oracle against him:
122Kg 9:26 'This is what the Lord says, "I have certainly observed the blood of Naboth and his sons, and I will repay you on this property," declares the Lord.' "Therefore take the body and throw it in the field, just as the Lord said."
122Kg 9:27 As soon as King Ahaziah of Judah observed this, he attempted to flee by the garden house road, but Jehu pursued him. At the ascent toward Gur which is near Ibleam, he ordered, "Shoot him in the chariot, too!" Ahaziah fled to Megiddo, where he died. 
122Kg 9:28 Ahaziah's servants transported the king's body by chariot to Jerusalem and buried it in his own sepulcher near his ancestors in the city of David. 
122Kg 9:29 Ahaziah had begun to reign over Judah in the eleventh year of the reign of Ahab's son Joram.
122Kg 9:30 As soon as Jehu arrived at Jezreel, Jezebel adorned her eyes, arranged her hair, and peered out a window. 
122Kg 9:31 When Jehu had entered through the gate, she asked, "Was Zimri, who murdered his master, received well?"
122Kg 9:32 Jehu looked up toward the window and called out, "Who is on my side?Who?" When two or three eunuchs looked out at him, 
122Kg 9:33 he ordered, "Throw her down!" So they did, and her blood splashed against the wall and on the horses, while Jehu trampled her underfoot. 
122Kg 9:34 Later on, after he had come in to eat and drink, he ordered, "Go and see to this cursed woman, and bury her, because she was a king's daughter." 
122Kg 9:35 But when they went out to bury her, they found nothing left of her except her skull, her feet, and the palms of her hands. 
122Kg 9:36 So they returned and reported to Jehu, and he responded, "This fulfills the word of the Lord that he spoke through his servant Elijah the foreigner, who said£º 'Dogs will eat Jezebel's flesh on the property of Jezreel, 
122Kg 9:37 and her corpse will lie like dung on the surface of the field on the property in Jezreel, but no one will say, "This is Jezebel."'"
122Kg 10:1 Meanwhile, Ahab had 70 sons who lived in Samaria. So Jehu wrote letters and sent them to Samaria - to the rulers of Jezreel, the elders, and the guardians of Ahab's children. He told them, 
122Kg 10:2 "As soon as you receive this letter (since your master's children are with you, you have chariots and horses there with you, and you are protected by a walled city and weaponry), 
122Kg 10:3 select the best and most qualified of your master's sons, set him in place on his father's throne, and fight for your master's dynasty!"
122Kg 10:4 But they were too terrified, and so they said to one another, "Look! Two previous kings couldn't stand up to Jehu, so how can we?" 
122Kg 10:5 So the household overseer, the city supervisor, along with the elders and the children's guardians sent word to Jehu, telling him, "We will serve you and do everything you ask. We won't set up a king, so do what you want to do."
122Kg 10:6 But Jehu wrote them another letter£º "If you're loyal to me, and if you intend to obey my commands, then bring the heads of your master's sons and meet me in Jezreel about this time tomorrow."  Now the king's sons, totaling 70 men, were living with the leading men of the city, who were their guardians. 
122Kg 10:7 When the letter from Jehu arrived, the city leaders arrested the king's sons, slaughtered all 70 of them, put their heads in baskets, and sent them to Jehu at Jezreel.
122Kg 10:8 When the messenger arrived to report to the king, he said, "They have brought the heads of the king's sons." Jehu replied, "Put them in two piles at the entrance of the city gate until morning." 
122Kg 10:9 The next morning, Jehu went out, stood still, and announced to all the people£º "Are you righteous?I conspired against my master and killed him, but who slaughtered all of these?
122Kg 10:10 Keep this in mind - not a single statement by the Lord will fail to come about that he spoke concerning Ahab's dynasty, because the Lord has accomplished what he predicted by his servant Elijah."
122Kg 10:11 So Jehu executed all those who remained from Ahab's dynasty in Jezreel, including all of Ahab's men, his friends, and his priests, until there remained not even one survivor. 
122Kg 10:12 Then Jehu got up, left the city, and went to Samaria. When he arrived at the shearing house that was located on the way, Jehu met up with the relatives of king Ahaziah of Judah. He asked them "Who are you?" They answered, "We're Ahaziah's relatives, and we've come down to greet the king's sons and the sons of the queen mother."
122Kg 10:14 Jehu ordered, "Take them alive!" So Jehu's soldiers captured them and executed all 42 of them near the pit at the shearing house. He left none of them alive.
122Kg 10:15 After he left there, he encountered Rechab's son Jehonadab. After he greeted him, Jehu asked him, "Is your heart right, as my heart is with yours?" "It is," Jehonadab answered. "If it is," Jehu replied, "Put out your hand." So Jehonadab stuck out his hand, and Jehu took him up to stand in his chariot. 
122Kg 10:16 He told him, "Come with me and see my enthusiasm for the Lord!" So Jehu had Jehonadab ride in his chariot.
122Kg 10:17 When Jehu arrived in Samaria, he executed everyone who remained of Ahab's household in Samaria, until he had utterly destroyed Ahab in accordance with the word of the Lord that he spoke to Elijah.
122Kg 10:18 Then Jehu assembled all the people and announced to them, "Ahab served Baal a little, but Jehu will serve him a lot! 
122Kg 10:19 Therefore summon all of Baal's prophets to me, including all his worshipers and all his priests. Don't leave even one out, because I've prepared a great sacrifice for Baal. Whoever doesn't show up doesn't live!" But Jehu did this deceptively, intending to destroy Baal's worshippers. 
122Kg 10:20 Jehu ordered, "Set aside a solemn assembly for Baal!" And so they proclaimed it. 
122Kg 10:21 Jehu sent the proclamation throughout Israel, and all the Baal worshipers came. There wasn't a single man left who failed to come. When they entered Baal's temple, it was filled from one end to the other. 
122Kg 10:22 Then Jehu ordered the one in charge of the wardrobe, "Bring out garments for all of the worshipers of Baal." So he brought out garments for them.
122Kg 10:23 Jehu and Rechab's son Jehonadab entered Baal's temple, and Jehu said to the Baal worshipers, "Look around and be sure that no servant of the Lord is here among you, but only worshipers of Baal." 
122Kg 10:24 Then they went in to offer sacrifices and burnt offerings. Meanwhile, Jehu had stationed 80 men outside, ordering them, "If any of these men whom I've brought into your control escape, the one who allows it will forfeit his life."
122Kg 10:25 As soon as he had completed the burnt offering, Jehu ordered the guards and the officers, "Go in and execute them Don't let even one man escape." So they executed them with swords, and the guards and the officers threw the bodies out and proceeded into the inner room of Baal's temple, 
122Kg 10:26 from which they brought out the sacred pillars and burned them. 
122Kg 10:27 They also cut down the pillar to Baal, tore apart Baal's temple, and turned it into a latrine - and it remains that way today. 
122Kg 10:28 That's how Jehu eradicated Baal from Israel. 
122Kg 10:29 Even so, Jehu never abandoned the sins of Nebat's son Jeroboam, who caused Israel to sin, regarding the golden calves that were at Bethel and Dan.
122Kg 10:30 Nevertheless, the Lord said to Jehu, "Because you have done well in carrying out what I saw as the right thing to do by completing everything I had in mind regarding Ahab's dynasty, your sons shall sit on the throne of Israel to the fourth generation." 
122Kg 10:31 But Jehu did not remain careful to walk in the instruction of the Lord God of Israel with all his heart. He never abandoned the sins of Jeroboam that had caused Israel to sin. 
122Kg 10:32 In those days the Lord began to reduce Israel in size£º Hazael defeated them throughout the territory of Israel, 
122Kg 10:33 from the Jordan River eastward, all the territory of Gilead, the Gadites, the Reubenites, and the Manassites, from Aroer by the Valley of the Arnon, including Gilead and Bashan.3010
122Kg 10:34 Now as to the rest of Jehu's activities, including his valiant deeds, they are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
122Kg 10:35 Then Jehu died, as did his ancestors, and they buried him in Samaria. His son Jehoahaz reigned in his place. 36Jehu reigned over Israel in Samaria for 28 years.
122Kg 11:1 As soon as Ahaziah's mother Athaliah learned that her son had died, she seized the throne and executed the entire royal bloodline. 
122Kg 11:2 But King Joram's daughter Jehosheba, who was Ahaziah's sister, rescued Ahaziah's son Joash from the group of the king's sons who were being executed and hid him and his nurse in her bedroom, concealing him from Athaliah so he was not put to death. 
122Kg 11:3 So Joash remained hidden with her in the Lord's temple for six years while Athaliah reigned over the land.
122Kg 11:4 But during the seventh year of her reign, Jehoida went out and called together the rulers of hundreds, the captains, and the guards, and assembled them together inside the Lord's temple. He made a covenant with them, making them take an oath in the Lord's temple, and then he revealed the king's son to them. 
122Kg 11:5 He ordered them£º "Here's what we'll do£º A third of you will enter here on this coming Sabbath dressed as guardians of the watch for the king's palace, 
122Kg 11:6 with a third of you at the Sur gate, and a third at the gate behind the guards. Keep watch over the palace and defend it. 
122Kg 11:7 Two of you who enter here on this coming Sabbath are to stand watch at the Lord's temple, 
122Kg 11:8 guarding the king and surrounding him with weapons in hand. Whoever comes within range is to be killed. Stay with the king wherever he goes, coming or going."5
122Kg 11:9 So the captains of hundreds did just as Jehoiada the priest ordered. Each one of them assembled his men who were to enter on the Sabbath, along with those who were to leave on the Sabbath, and approached Jehoiada the priest.
122Kg 11:10 The priest issued king David's personal spears and shields that had been stored in the Lord's temple to the captains of hundreds. 
122Kg 11:11 So the guards stood assembled, every soldier with weapons in hand, surrounding the king from the right side corner of the temple to the left side corner, including around the altar and the temple.
122Kg 11:12 Then he brought out the king's son, put the royal crown on him, presented him with the Testimony, and installed him as king. They anointed him, applauded, and said, "May the king live!"
122Kg 11:13 When Athaliah heard all of the commotion coming from those who were guarding the people, she approached the people who were in the Lord's temple. 
122Kg 11:14 She looked around - and there was the king, standing near a column, as was the royal custom! He was accompanied by the commanding officers, along with trumpeters who stood beside the king. All the people of the land sounded trumpets in their excitement. But Athaliah tore her clothes and bellowed, "It's a plot! A conspiracy!"
122Kg 11:15 Jehoiada the priest commanded the captains in charge of the army, "Take her out the back way and execute anybody who follows her," since the priest had also issued this order£º "Let's not put her to death in the Lord's temple." 
122Kg 11:16 So they arrested Athaliah, took her out through the same entrance used by the horses for entering the king's palace, and executed her.
122Kg 11:17 Then Jehoiada entered into a covenant with the Lord, the king, and the people, that they would live as the Lord's people, and also entered into a covenant with the king and the people. 
122Kg 11:18 Then all of the people of the land entered Baal's temple, tore it down, and broke his altars and his images to pieces, killing Mattan the priest of Baal right in front of the altars. Furthermore, Jehoiada the priest appointed officers to guard the Lord's temple, 
122Kg 11:19 and brought the commanders of hundreds, the Carites, the guards, and all the people of the land, taking the king out of the Lord's temple, marching through the guard's gate to the king's palace, where Joash took his seat on the throne of the kings. 
122Kg 11:20 After this, everyone throughout the land rejoiced and the city was at peace, because they had executed Athaliah at the king's palace.1119
122Kg 11:21 Jehoash began to reign as king when he was seven years old, 
122Kg 12:1 ascending to the throne in the seventh year of the reign of Jehu and then reigning for 40 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah from Beersheba. 
122Kg 12:2 Jehoash did what the Lord considered to be right during the entire time when Jehoiada the priest was instructing him, 
122Kg 12:3 except that the high places were not demolished, so the people continued to sacrifice and burn incense on the high places.
122Kg 12:4 Jehoash spoke to the priests about all of the proceeds of the consecrated gifts that were being brought into the Lord's temple, cash from every man who was traveling through the area, cash obtained by personal assessment, and all the cash that came through voluntary gifts into the Lord's temple:
122Kg 12:5 "Let the priests get support for themselves from their own donors, and let them repair the temple wherever a leak in need of repair shall be discovered."
122Kg 12:6 But 23 years into the reign of king Jehoash, the priests still had not repaired the leaks in the temple. 
122Kg 12:7 So king Jehoash called for Jehoiada the priest, along with other priests, and asked them, "Why haven't you fixed the leaks in the temple?Stop receiving donations from your acquaintances for repairing the leaks in the temple."
122Kg 12:8 So the priests agreed to receive no more cash from the people, but they didn't repair the leaks in the temple, either. 
122Kg 12:9 So Jehoiada the priest grabbed a chest, bored an opening in its lid, and placed it next to the altar, on the right side as one enters the Lord's temple. The priests who tended the entryway put all the money that was brought into the Lord's temple into the chest. 
122Kg 12:10 As a result, whenever they noticed that there was a lot of money in the chest, the king's secretary and the high priest went forward, put the money in bags, counted the money that had been given over to the Lord's temple, 
122Kg 12:11 and disbursed the cash directly into the hands of those who did the work and who were in charge of the oversight of the Lord's temple. They paid it to the carpenters and builders who worked on the Lord's temple, 
122Kg 12:12 to masons and stonecutters, and for procurement of timber and quarried stone for making repairs to the Lord's temple, and for all outlays needed for repairs of the temple.
122Kg 12:13 But no provision was included for the Lord's temple from the money that was brought into the Lord's temple for silver basins, snuffers, bowls, trumpets, or any vessels made of gold or silver, 
122Kg 12:14 because that money had been allocated to the workmen who were repairing the Lord's temple. 
122Kg 12:15 Furthermore, they required no accounting from the men into whose hand they had paid the money to do the work, because the workers acted in good faith. 
122Kg 12:16 The money from the guilt offerings and from the sin offerings was not brought into the Lord's temple, because it was allocated to the priests.
122Kg 12:17 Later, King Hazael of Aram invaded and attacked Gath, captured it, and then set out to approach Jerusalem. 
122Kg 12:18 So King Jehoash of Judah took all of the sacred things that his ancestors Jehoshaphat, Jehoram, and Ahaziah, kings of Judah, had dedicated, along with his own dedicated things, and all the gold that could be located within the treasure vaults of the Lord's temple and in the king's palace, and paid off King Hazael of Aram. Then Hazael left Jerusalem.
122Kg 12:19 Now the rest of the Joash's activities - everything he did - are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not?
122Kg 12:20 His servants rose up in rebellion, formed a conspiracy, and assassinated Joash in the palace at the terrace ramparts while he was on his way down to Silla. 
122Kg 12:21 Shimeath's son Jozacar and Shomer's son Jehozabad, his servants, attacked him and he died. They buried him alongside his ancestors in the city of David, and his son Amaziah became king to replace him.
122Kg 13:1 During the twenty-third year of the reign of Ahaziah's son Joash, king of Judah, Jehu's son Jehoahaz began his seventeen year reign in Samaria over Israel. 
122Kg 13:2 He did what the Lord considered to be evil, after the pattern of Nebat's son Jeroboam. By doing so, he caused Israel to sin, and he never changed course from it. 
122Kg 13:3 As a result, the Lord's wrath flared up against Israel, so he handed them over to domination by king Hazael of Aram and later into the constant domination by Hazael's son Ben-hadad. 
122Kg 13:4 But Jehoahaz sought the Lord, and the Lord paid attention to him, because the Lord had been watching the oppression that Israel was enduring from the king of Aram.3
122Kg 13:5 The Lord provided Israel with a deliverer, so they escaped the Aramean oppression while the descendants of Israel lived in tents as they had formerly. 
122Kg 13:6 Nevertheless, they did not change course away from the sins of Jeroboam's household, by which he caused Israel to sin, but continued on that same course, with Asherah poles remaining in place in Samaria. 
122Kg 13:7 For the Aramean king had left only 50 cavalry, ten chariots, and 10,000 soldiers out of the army belonging to Jehoahaz, because the king of Aram had destroyed the others, making them like chaff left over after threshing.
122Kg 13:8 Now the rest of the activities of Jehoahaz, including everything he did and his grandeur, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
122Kg 13:9 So Jehoahaz died, as did his ancestors, and he was buried in Samaria while his son Joash replaced him as king.
122Kg 13:10 During the thirty-seventh year of the reign of king Joash of Judah, Jehoahaz's son Jehoash began a sixteen year reign as king over Israel in Samaria. 
122Kg 13:11 He practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, not changing course from all of the sins practiced by Nebat's son Jeroboam by which he caused Israel to sin. Instead, he continued on that same course. 
122Kg 13:12 The rest of Joash's activities, including everything he did and the vehemence with which he fought against king Amaziah of Judah are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
122Kg 13:13 So Joash died, as did his ancestors, and Jeroboam assumed his throne after Joash was buried in Samaria with the kings of Israel.
122Kg 13:14 When Elisha fell ill with the sickness from which he was about to die, king Joash of Israel came down to see him, wept in his presence, and told him, "My father, Israel's chariots and horsemen!"
122Kg 13:15 Elisha told him, "Pick up a bow and some arrows." So he picked up a bow and some arrows.
122Kg 13:16 Then Elisha told Israel's king, "Draw the bow!" As he did so, Elisha laid his hands on top of the king's hands 
122Kg 13:17 and ordered him, "Open a window that faces east." So he did so. Elisha ordered him, "Shoot!" So he shot. Then Elisha said, "This is the Lord's arrow of victory - the victory arrow against Aram, because you will defeat the Arameans at Aphek until you will have utterly finished them off."
122Kg 13:18 After this Elisha said, "Pick up the arrows." So the king picked them up. Then Elisha told the king of Israel, "Strike the ground!" So he struck it three times and then stood still.
122Kg 13:19 At this the man of God became angry at him and told him, "You should have struck five or six times! Then you would have attacked Aram until you would have destroyed it! But as it is now, you'll defeat Aram only three times!"
122Kg 13:20 Later, Elisha died and was buried. Now at that time various Moabite marauders had been invading the land each spring. 
122Kg 13:21 One day while some Israelites were burying a man, they saw some marauders, so they threw the man into Elisha's grave. But when the man fell against Elisha's remains, he revived and rose to his feet.
122Kg 13:22 Meanwhile, king Hazael of Aram had been oppressing Israel throughout the reign of Jehoahaz, 
122Kg 13:23 but the Lord showed grace to them, displayed his compassion toward them, and turned to them due to his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. He would not destroy them or evict them from his presence up until that time. 
122Kg 13:24 After king Hazael of Aram died, his son Ben-hadad replaced him as king. 
122Kg 13:25 At that time, Jehoahaz's son Jehoash recaptured from Hazael's son Ben-hadad the cities that Hazael had captured through warfare from the control of Jehoahaz, Jehoash's father. Joash defeated and recovered cities of Israel from Ben-Hadad three times.
122Kg 14:1 Amaziah, son of Judah's king Joash, became king during the second year of the reign of Joash, son of king Joahaz of Israel 
122Kg 14:2 at the age of 25. He reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddin of Jerusalem.
122Kg 14:3 He practiced what the Lord considered to be right, but not like his ancestor David did. He acted as his father Joash had done, 
122Kg 14:4 except that the high places were not abolished. The people continued to offer sacrifices and to burn incense on the high places. 
122Kg 14:5 Later on, as soon as he was in firm control of his kingdom, he executed the servants who had murdered his father the king, 
122Kg 14:6 but he did not execute the children of the murderers, in keeping with what is written in the book of the Law of Moses, as the Lord had commanded£º "Fathers must not be put to death because of their children's sin; nor shall children die because of their fathers' sin, for each person shall be put to death for his own sin."4
122Kg 14:7 Joash executed 10,000 Edomites in the Salt Valley and captured Sela in battle, renaming it Joktheel, which remains its name to this day. 
122Kg 14:8 Later, Amaziah sent couriers to Jehoahaz's son Jehoash, grandson of king Jehu of Israel, challenging him, "Come on! Let's fight face to face!"
122Kg 14:9 But king Jehoash of Israel sent this message to king Amaziah of Judah£º "The thorn bush in Lebanon sent this message to the cedar of Lebanon£º 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' But just then a wild beast from Lebanon wandered by and trampled down the thorn bush. 
122Kg 14:10 You just defeated Edom and you're arrogant. Bask in your victory and stay home. Why incite trouble so that you - yes, you! - fall, along with Judah with you?"
122Kg 14:11 But Amaziah refused to listen. So Israel's king Jehoash and Judah's king Amaziah faced each other at Beth-shemesh, which is part of Judah. 
122Kg 14:12 Judah was defeated by Israel, and everybody fled to their own tents. 
122Kg 14:13 Then king Jehoash of Israel captured Judah's king Amaziah, the son of Jehoash and grandson of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh. He went to Jerusalem and demolished 600 yards of the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. 
122Kg 14:14 He confiscated all the gold and silver, all the instruments he could find in the Lord's temple and in the palace treasuries. He also captured some hostages and then returned to Samaria.
122Kg 14:15 The rest of Jehoash's activities that he undertook, including his valor in fighting king Amaziah of Judah, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
122Kg 14:16 Jehoash died, as had his ancestors, and he was buried in Samaria alongside the kings of Israel. His son Jeroboam reigned in his place.
122Kg 14:17 Joash's son king Amaziah of Judah lived for fifteen years after Jehoahaz' son king Jehoash of Israel died. 
122Kg 14:18 The rest of Amaziah's activities are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not?
122Kg 14:19 A conspiracy arose against him in Jerusalem, and he ran off to Lachish, but he was pursued to Lachish and killed there. 
122Kg 14:20 His body was brought back on horses and he was buried at Jerusalem alongside his ancestors in the city of David.
122Kg 14:21 All the people of Judah took Azariah, who was sixteen years old, and installed him as king to take the place of his father Amaziah. 
122Kg 14:22 He rebuilt Elath and restored it to Judah. Later on the king died, as did his ancestors.
122Kg 14:23 In the fifteenth year of the reign of Amaziah son of Joash, king of Judah, Jeroboam son of Joash, king of Israel, began a 41 year reign in Samaria. 
122Kg 14:24 He did what the Lord considered to be evil by not abandoning all the sins of Nebat's son Jeroboam, who made Israel sin. 
122Kg 14:25 He rebuilt Israel's coastline from the entrance of Hamath as far as the Sea of the Arabah, in accordance with the word of the Lord God of Israel that he spoke through his servant Jonah the prophet, Amittai's son, who was from Gath-hepher. 
122Kg 14:26 For the Lord observed Israel's bitter misery, and there was no one left, neither slave nor free, and there was no deliverer for Israel. 
122Kg 14:27 The Lord had never said that he would erase the name of Israel from under heaven. Instead, he delivered them by Joash's son Jeroboam. 
122Kg 14:28 The rest of Jeroboam's actions - everything he did, including his powerful fighting and how on behalf of Israel he restored Damascus and Hamath to Judah - are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not - 1426
122Kg 14:29 Jeroboam died, as had his ancestors the kings of Israel, and his son Zechariah became king in his place.
122Kg 15:1 Amaziah's son Azariah began reigning during the twenty-seventh year of the reign of Jeroboam, king of Israel. 
122Kg 15:2 He was sixteen years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jecoliah; she was from Jerusalem. 
122Kg 15:3 He did what the Lord considered to be right, just as his father Amaziah had done in everything, 
122Kg 15:4 except that the high places were never removed, and the people kept on sacrificing and burning incense on the high places.
122Kg 15:5 The Lord struck the king so that he was afflicted with leprosy until the day he died. He lived in a separate house while his son Jotham managed the household and ruled the people who lived in the land. 
122Kg 15:6 Now the rest of Azariah's activities, including everything he did, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not?
122Kg 15:7 Later, Azariah died, as had his ancestors, and they buried him with his ancestors in the city of David. His son Jotham then reigned in his place.6
122Kg 15:8 During the thirty-eighth year of the reign of Azaraiah, king of Judah, Jeroboam's son Zachariah began a six-month reign in Samaria. 
122Kg 15:9 He did what the Lord considered to be evil, just as his ancestors had done. He never abandoned the sins of Nebat's son Jeroboam, who caused Israel to sin. 
122Kg 15:10 So Jabesh's son Shallum conspired against him and attacked him in full view of the people, killed him, and reigned in his place. 
122Kg 15:11 The rest of Zachariah's activities are recorded in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 15:12 This is what the Lord told Jehu£º "Your children will sit on Israel's throne for the next four generations." And that's exactly what happened. 
122Kg 15:13 Jabesh's son Shallum began his reign in the thirty-ninth year of the reign of Uzziah, king of Judah. He reigned a full month in Samaria, 
122Kg 15:14 then Gadi's son Menahem approached Samaria from Tirzah and attacked Jabesh's son Shallum, executed him, and reigned in his place. 
122Kg 15:15 The rest of Shallum's activities, including the conspiracy that he carried out, are recorded in the book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not - 
122Kg 15:16 At another time, Menahem attacked Tiphsah and all of its inhabitants, including its coastlands from Tirzah, because they would not open the city gate for him. After defeating them, he ripped open all of their pregnant women. 
122Kg 15:17 In the thirty-ninth year of the reign of Azariah, king of Judah, Gadi's son Menahem began a ten-year reign over Israel from Samaria. 
122Kg 15:18 He did what the Lord considered to be evil by never abandoning the sins of Nebat's son Jeroboam, who caused Israel to sin, as long as he lived.
122Kg 15:19 Later on, King Pul of Aram attacked the land, and Menahem paid Pul 1,000 silver talents so Pul would join forces with Menahem to secure his hold on the kingdom. 
122Kg 15:20 Menahem exacted the money from all of Israel's powerful and wealthy men, 50 shekels from each, to pay the king of Aram. As a result, the king of Aram retreated and did not remain there in the land. 
122Kg 15:21 The rest of Menahem's activities, including everything that he did, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel, are they not?
122Kg 15:22 Then Menahem died, as did his ancestors, and his son Pekahiah reigned in his place.
122Kg 15:23 Menahem's son Pekahiah became king over Israel for two years during the fiftieth year of the reign of King Azariah of Judah. 
122Kg 15:24 He did what the Lord considered to be evil. Just as Nebat's son Jeroboam had led Israel into sin, so also Pekahiah did not stop doing the same thing. 
122Kg 15:25 Then Remaliah's son Pekah, Pekahiah's officer, conspired against him with Argob and Arieh. Accompanied by 50 Gileadite men, Pekah attacked Pekahiah inside the palace of the king's compound in Samaria, executed him, and reigned as king in his place. 
122Kg 15:26 The rest of Pekahiah's activities, including everything he did, are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 15:27 Remaliah's son Pekah began a 20-year reign as Israel's king during the fifty-second year of King Azariah of Judah. 
122Kg 15:28 He did what the Lord considered to be evil by never abandoning the sins of Nebat's son Jeroboam, by which he caused Israel to sin. 
122Kg 15:29 During the lifetime of King Pekah of Israel, King Tiglath-pilezer of Assyria attacked. He captured the cities of Ijon, Abel Beth Maacah, Janoah, Kedesh, and Hazor. He also captured Gilead, Galilee, and the entire territory of Naphtali, and carried its people off to Assyria. 
122Kg 15:30 So during the twentieth year of the reign of Uzziah's son Jotham, Elah's son Hoshea conspired against Ramaliah's son Pekah, attacked him, executed him, and became king in his place. 
122Kg 15:31 The rest of Pekah's activities, including everything that he accomplished, are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.
122Kg 15:32 Uzziah's son Jotham became king over Judah during the second year of the reign of Remaliah's son Pekah, king of Israel. 
122Kg 15:33 He was 25 years old when he became king. He reigned 16 years in Jerusalem. Zadok's daughter Jerusha was his mother. 
122Kg 15:34 He did what the Lord considered to be right, following everything his father Uzziah had done, 
122Kg 15:35 except the high places were not torn down, and the people still sacrificed and burned incense on the high places. But he rebuilt the upper gate of the Lord's temple. 
122Kg 15:36 The rest of Jotham's activities, including everything that he accomplished, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not - 
122Kg 15:37 Right about that time, the Lord began to send King Rezin of Aram and Remaliah's son Pekah against Judah. 
122Kg 15:38 Meanwhile, Jotham died, as did his ancestors, and he was buried with them in the city of David, his ancestor, and Jotham's son Ahaz reigned in his place.
122Kg 16:1 During the seventeenth year of the reign of Remaliah's son Pekah, Jotham's son Ahaz became king of Judah. 
122Kg 16:2 Ahaz was 20 years old when he became king, and he ruled in Jerusalem for sixteen years. He did not practice what the Lord considered to be right, as had his ancestor David. 
122Kg 16:3 Instead, he behaved like the kings of Israel did by making his son pass through fire, the very same abomination that the heathen practiced, whom the Lord evicted from the land right in front of the Israelites. 
122Kg 16:4 Furthermore, Ahaz sacrificed and burned incense on the high places, on top of hills, and under every green tree.
122Kg 16:5 Later, King Rezin of Aram and Remaliah's son Peka, king of Israel, approached Jerusalem to attack it. They besieged Ahaz but could not conquer him. 
122Kg 16:6 But at that time King Rezin of Aram recovered Elath for Aram, completely removing the Judeans from Elath. Then the Arameans returned to Elath and have remained there to this day. 
122Kg 16:7 So Ahaz sent envoys to Tiglath-pileser, king of Assyria to tell him, "I am your servant and son. Save me from the king of Aram and the king of Israel, who are attacking me." 
122Kg 16:8 Then Ahaz took the silver and gold that was in the Lord's temple and in the palace treasuries and sent them as a gift to the king of Assyria, 
122Kg 16:9 so the king of Assyria listened to Ahaz. He attacked Damascus, captured it, sent its people away into exile to Kir, and executed Rezin.
122Kg 16:10 King Ahaz traveled to Damascus and met with King Tiglath-pileser of Assyria, where he observed the altar at Damascus. So King Ahaz sent a set of construction patterns of this altar to Urijah the priest. 
122Kg 16:11 Urijah the priest built an altar, following the plans that King Ahaz had sent him from Damascus and finishing the altar before King Ahaz returned from Damascus. 
122Kg 16:12 When the king returned from Damascus, as soon as he saw the altar, he approached it and offered sacrifices on it. 
122Kg 16:13 He presented a burnt offering, a meat offering, poured out a drink offering, and sprinkled the blood of a peace offering on his altar. 
122Kg 16:14 Then he took the bronze altar that stood in the Lord's presence from in front of the temple, moved it to the north side of his altar, 
122Kg 16:15 and issued these orders to Urijah the priest£º "Burn the morning burnt offering, the evening grain offering, the king's burnt offering and grain offering, the whole burnt offering, the grain offering, and the drink offering on behalf of all the people of the land on the large altar. And sprinkle all the blood from the burnt offering and from the sacrifice. But I will use the bronze altar to ask God questions."
122Kg 16:16 So Urijah the priest did precisely what King Ahaz ordered. 
122Kg 16:17 Later, King Ahaz ordered the side panels removed from the bases, along with the washing bowls that had stood on top of the bases. He also removed the large bowl that was called the Sea from on top of the bronze bulls that supported it, and put it on a stone base. 
122Kg 16:18 Then Ahaz removed the covered walkway for use on the Sabbath that they had built in the temple. Because of the king of Assyria, he also removed the outside entrance from the Lord's temple that had been built exclusively for the king.
122Kg 16:19 Now the rest of Ahaz's activities are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not?
122Kg 16:20 Later, Ahaz died, as did his ancestors, and was buried alongside his ancestors in the city of David. His son Hezekiah reigned in his place.
122Kg 17:1 During the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahaz of Judah, Elah's son Hoshea became king over Israel for nine years in Samaria. 
122Kg 17:2 He practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, though not like the kings of Israel who had preceded him. 
122Kg 17:3 King Shalmaneser of Assyria attacked him, and Hoshea became his servant and paid tribute to him. 
122Kg 17:4 But the king of Assyria uncovered a conspiracy involving Hoshea, who had sent envoys to King So of Egypt and stopped offering tribute to the king of Assyria, as he had done annually. As a result, the king of Assyria placed him under arrest and sent him to prison. 
122Kg 17:5 After this, the king of Assyria invaded the entire land, approached Samaria, and began a three year siege. 
122Kg 17:6 As a result, during the ninth year of the reign of Hoshea, the king of Assyria captured Samaria and took the Israelites off to Assyria, placing them in Halah, along the Habor River in Gozan, and in cities ruled by the Medes.
122Kg 17:7 This happened because the Israelites had sinned against the Lord their God, who had brought them up from the land of Egypt and from the domination of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, because they were fearing other gods, 
122Kg 17:8 and because they were following the rules of the nations whom the Lord had expelled before the Israelites and that the kings of Israel had practiced.7
122Kg 17:9 The Israelites practiced secret things that were not right, offending the Lord their God. In addition, they built high places for use by all their towns, watchtowers, and fortified cities. 
122Kg 17:10 They set up pillars and Asherim on every high hill and in the shade of every green tree, 
122Kg 17:11 where they made offerings on all the high places, as did the nations whom the Lord had expelled before them. They also practiced other wickedness, provoking the Lord to become angry, 
122Kg 17:12 and they served idols, a practice that the Lord had warned them, "You are not to do this."
122Kg 17:13 Nevertheless, the Lord had warned both Israel and Judah by means of every prophet and seer£º "Turn away from your evil practices and keep my commandments and statutes according to the entire law that I gave your ancestors and that I sent to you through my servants, the prophets." 
122Kg 17:14 But they would not listen. Instead, they were stubborn, just like their ancestors had been, who did not believe in the Lord their God. 
122Kg 17:15 They rejected the Lord's statutes, the covenant that he had made with their ancestors, and his warnings that he gave them. They pursued meaninglessness - and became meaningless themselves - as they followed the lifestyles of the nations that surrounded them, a practice that the Lord had warned them not to do.13
122Kg 17:16 They abandoned all of the commands given by the Lord their God, crafted for themselves cast images of two calves, constructed an Asherah, worshipped all of the stars in heaven, and served Baal. 
122Kg 17:17 They passed their sons and daughters through fire, practiced divination, cast spells, and sold themselves to practice what the Lord considered to be evil, thereby provoking him. 
122Kg 17:18 As a result, the Lord was angry with Israel and removed them from his presence. No one was left except for the tribe of Judah.
122Kg 17:19 But Judah, too, did not keep the commands of the Lord their God. Instead, they lived the lifestyle that Israel had chosen, 
122Kg 17:20 so the Lord rejected all of the descendants of Israel, afflicted them, and handed them over to the control of plunderers until he had thrown them away from his presence. 
122Kg 17:21 He ripped them away from the heritage of David, even as the people appointed Nebat's son Jeroboam to be king. Jeroboam drove Israel away from following the Lord and made them commit great sin.
122Kg 17:22 The Israelites practiced all the sins that Jeroboam had practiced, and never wavered from them 
122Kg 17:23 until the Lord removed Israel from his presence, just as he had warned through all of his prophets who served him. So Israel was carried off into exile from their own land into Assyria, where they remain to this day.
122Kg 17:24 Because the king of Assyria brought captives from Babylon, Cuthah, Avva, Hamath, and Sephar-vaim and settled them in the cities of Samaria to replace the Israelites, the settlers possessed Samaria and lived in its cities. 
122Kg 17:25 When they first began to live there, the settlers did not fear the Lord, so he sent lions among them, and they killed a few of them. 
122Kg 17:26 As a result, they reported to the king of Assyria, "Because the nations whom you exiled to live in the cities of Samaria don't know the law of the god of the land, he has sent lions among them. Look how the lions are killing them, because they don't know the law of the god of the land!"
122Kg 17:27 So the king of Assyria issued this order£º "Take one of the priests whom you carried away and let him go back and live there. Let him teach them the law of the god of the land." 
122Kg 17:28 So one of the priests whom they had carried away from Samaria went to live in Bethel to teach them how they ought to fear the Lord.
122Kg 17:29 Nevertheless, each nation continued to craft their own gods and install them in the temples on the high places that the people of Samaria had constructed - every nation in their own cities where they continued to live. 
122Kg 17:30 Settlers from Babylon built Succoth-benoth, settlers from Cuth built Nergal, settlers from Hamath built Ashima, 
122Kg 17:31 and settlers from Avva built Nibhaz and Tartak. The residents of Sephar-vaim burned their children in fire to Adrammelech and Anammelech, the gods of Sephar-vaim.
122Kg 17:32 Because they feared the Lord, they also appointed from among themselves priests for the high places who acted on their behalf in the temples on the high places. 
122Kg 17:33 While they continued to fear the Lord, they served their own gods following the custom of the nations whom they had carried away from there. 
122Kg 17:34 To this very day they still follow the former customs£º they don't fear the Lord, they don't live in accordance with their statutes, ordinances, law, or commandments that the Lord had given to the descendants of Jacob, whom he renamed Israel 
122Kg 17:35 and with whom the Lord had made a covenant when he gave these orders to them£º "You are not to fear other gods, bow down to them, serve them, or sacrifice to them. 
122Kg 17:36 Instead, it is to be the Lord, who brought you up from the land of Egypt, showing great power and public demonstrations of might, whom you are to fear, worship, and to whom you are to offer sacrifice. 
122Kg 17:37 Furthermore, you are to be careful to observe forever the statutes, ordinances, law, and the commandment that he wrote for you. And you are not to fear other gods. 
122Kg 17:38 You are not to forget the covenant that I've made with you, and you are not to fear other gods. 
122Kg 17:39 But you are to fear the Lord, and he will deliver you from the control of all your enemies."
122Kg 17:40 But they wouldn't listen. Instead, they did what they had been doing before. 
122Kg 17:41 These nations feared the Lord and also served their carved images. Their descendants did the same thing, as did their grandchildren. Just as their ancestors had done, they also do the same thing to this day.
122Kg 18:1 Now it happened that during the third year of the reign of Elah's son Hoshea, king of Israel, that Ahaz' son Hezekiah became king. 
122Kg 18:2 He was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for 29 years. His mother was Zechariah's daughter Abi. 
122Kg 18:3 He did what the Lord considered to be right, according to everything that his ancestor David had done.
122Kg 18:4 He removed the high places, demolished the sacred pillars, and tore down the Asherah poles. He also demolished the bronze serpent that Moses had crafted, because the Israelites had been burning incense to it right up until that time. Hezekiah called it a piece of brass. 
122Kg 18:5 He trusted the Lord God of Israel, and after him there were none like him among all the kings of Judah, 
122Kg 18:6 because he depended on the Lord, not abandoning pursuit of him, and keeping the Lord's commands that he had commanded Moses. 
122Kg 18:7 So the Lord was with him, and Hezekiah prospered wherever he went, even when he rebelled against the king of Assyria, refusing to serve him. 
122Kg 18:8 He attacked the Philistines, invading Gaza and its borders from watchtower to fortified garrison.
122Kg 18:9 In the fourth year of King Hezekiah's reign (that is, during the seventh year of Elah's son Hosea's reign as king of Israel), King Shalmaneser from Assyria invaded Samaria and besieged it. 
122Kg 18:10 Three years later, they captured Samaria during the sixth year of Hezekiah's reign, which was the ninth year of Hoshea's reign as king of Israel. 
122Kg 18:11 After this, the king of Assyria carried off Israel into exile in Assyria, settling them in Halah, on the Habor River in Gozan, and in cities controlled by the Medes 
122Kg 18:12 because they would not obey the voice of the Lord their God. Instead, they transgressed his covenant, including everything that Moses the servant of the Lord had commanded, by neither listening nor putting what he had commanded into practice.
122Kg 18:13 During the fourteenth of the reign of King Hezekiah, King Sennacherib of Assyria approached all of the walled cities of Judah and seized them. 
122Kg 18:14 So Hezekiah sent this message to the king of Assyria at Lachish£º "I have offended you. Withdraw from me, and I'll accept whatever tribute you impose." So the king of Assyria required Hezekiah to pay him 300 talents of silver and 30 talents of gold. 
122Kg 18:15 Hezekiah gave him all the silver that could be removed from the Lord's temple and from the treasuries in the king's palace. 
122Kg 18:16 At that time, Hezekiah removed the doors to the Lord's temple and the doorposts that King Hezekiah had overlaid with gold, and gave the gold to the king of Assyria.
122Kg 18:17 Sometime later, the king of Assyria sent Tartan, Rab-saris, and Rabshakeh from Lachish to King Hezekiah in Jerusalem, accompanied with a large army. 
122Kg 18:18 When they called for the king, Hilkiah's son Eliakim, who managed the household, Shebnah the scribe, and Asaph's son Joah the recorder, went out to them.
122Kg 18:19 Rabshakeh told them, "Tell Hezekiah right now, 'This is what the great king, the king of Assyria says£º "Why are you so confident?
122Kg 18:20 You're saying - but they're only empty words?'I have enough advice and resources to conduct warfare!' "Now who are you relying on, that you have rebelled against me?
122Kg 18:21 Look, you're trusting on Egypt to lean on like a staff, but it's a crushed reed, and if you lean on it, it will collapse and pierce your hand. Pharaoh, king of Egypt, is just like that to everyone who relies on him!
122Kg 18:22 "Of course, you might tell me, 'We rely on the Lord our God!' But isn't it he whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah has demolished, all the while telling Jerusalem, 'You're to worship in front of this altar in Jerusalem?'
122Kg 18:23 "Come now, and make a deal with my master, the king of Assyria, and I'll give you 2,000 horses, if you can furnish them with riders. 
122Kg 18:24 How can you refuse even one official from the least of my master's servants and rely on Egypt for chariots and horsemen - 
122Kg 18:25 "Now then, haven't I come up - apart from the Lord - to attack and destroy this place?The Lord told me, 'Go up against this land and destroy it!'"'"
122Kg 18:26 At this, Hilkiah's son Eliakim, Shebnah, and Joah asked Rabshakeh, "Please speak to your servants in Aramaic, because we understand it, but don't speak the language of Judah to us within the hearing of the people who are on the wall."
122Kg 18:27 But Rabshakeh spoke to them, "Has my master sent me to talk about this just to your master and to you, and not also to the men who are sitting on the wall, who will soon be eating their own feces and drinking their own urine - along with you?" 
122Kg 18:28 Then Rabshakeh stood up and cried out loud, "Listen to what the great king, the king of Assyria has to say. 
122Kg 18:29 This is what the king says£º 'Don't let Hezekiah deceive you, because he will prove to be unable to deliver you from my control. 
122Kg 18:30 And don't let Hezekiah make you trust in the Lord by telling you, 'The Lord will certainly deliver us and this city will not be handed over to the king of Assyria.'
122Kg 18:31 'Don't listen to Hezekiah, because this is what the king of Assyria says£º "Make peace with me and come out to me! Each of you will eat from his own vine. Each will eat from his own fig tree. And each of you will drink water from his own cistern 32until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, one overflowing with grain 122Kg 18:an d new wine, a land filled with bread and vineyards, with olive trees and honey, so you may live and not die."
122Kg 18:32 'But don't listen to Hezekiah when he misleads you by saying "The Lord will deliver us!" 
122Kg 18:33 Has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land from control by the king of Assyria?
122Kg 18:34 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arpad?Where are the gods of Shephar-vaim, of Hena, and Ivvah?Have they delivered Samaria from my control?
122Kg 18:35 Who among all the gods of these lands has de¡©livered their land from my control, so that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem from me?'"
122Kg 18:36 But the people remained silent and did not answer with even so much as a word, because the king's order was, "Don't answer him."
122Kg 18:37 But Hilkiah's son Eliakim, who managed the household, Shebna the scribe, and Asaph's son Joah the recorder came back to Hezekiah with their clothes torn and told him what Rabshakeh had said.
122Kg 19:1 When King Hezekiah heard Eliakim's report, he tore his clothes, put on a sackcloth covering, entered the Lord's temple, 
122Kg 19:2 and sent Eliakim, the household supervisor, Shebna the scribe, and the elders of the priests, all of them covered in sackcloth, to Amoz's son, the prophet Isaiah. 
122Kg 19:3 They announced to him£º "This is what Hezekiah says£º 'Today is a day of trouble, rebuke, and blasphemy, because children are about to be born, but there is no strength to bring them to birth. 
122Kg 19:4 Perhaps the Lord your God will take note of everything that Rab¡©shakeh has said, whom his master the king of Assyria sent to taunt the living God, and then he will rebuke the words that the Lord your God has heard. Therefore offer a prayer for the survivors who remain.'"
122Kg 19:5 That is how the King Hezekiah's servants approached Isaiah.
122Kg 19:6 In reply, Isaiah responded to them, "Here's how you're to report to your master£º "This is what the Lord says£º 'Never be afraid of the words that you have heard by which the servants of the king of Assyria have blasphemed me. 
122Kg 19:7 Look! I'm going to cause an attitude to grow within him so that he'll hear a rumor and return to his own territory, where I'll make him die by the sword in his own land!'"'"
122Kg 19:8 So Rabshakeh returned and found the king of Assyria at war with Libnah, because Rabshakeh had heard that the king had left Lachish. 
122Kg 19:9 When he heard what was being said about King Tirhakah of Ethiopia, "Look! He has come out to attack you!" he again sent messengers to Hezekiah. The messengers were told, 
122Kg 19:10 "This is what you are to say to King Hezekiah of Judah£º 'Don't let your God in whom you trust deceive you by telling you "Jerusalem won't be turned over to the control of Assyria's king." 
122Kg 19:11 'Look! you've heard what the kings of Assyria have done to all the lands - they completely destroyed them! Will you be spared?
122Kg 19:12 Did the gods of those nations whom my an¡©cestors destroyed deliver them, including Gozan, Haran, Re¡©zeph, and Eden's descen¡©dents in Telassar?
122Kg 19:13 Where is the king of Hamath, the king of Arpad, the king of the city of Sephar¡©vaim, the king of Hena, or the king of Ivvah?'"
122Kg 19:14 Hezekiah took the messages from the couriers, read them, and went up to the Lord's temple, and laid them out in the presence of the Lord. 
122Kg 19:15 Then Hezekiah prayed in the presence of the Lord, "Lord God of Israel! You live between the cher¡©ubim! You alone are the God of all the kingdoms of the earth. You have fashioned the heavens and the earth. 
122Kg 19:16 Turn your ear, Lord, and listen! Open your eyes, Lord, and observe! Listen to the message sent by Sen¡©nacherib to insult the living God! 
122Kg 19:17 Truly, Lord, the kings of Assyria have devastated nations and their territories, 
122Kg 19:18 throwing their gods into fire, since they weren't gods but rather were the product of men's handiwork, wood and stone. And so they destroyed them. 
122Kg 19:19 Now, Lord our God, I'm praying that you will deliver us from his control, so that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone, Lord, are God!"
122Kg 19:20 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz send word to Hezekiah, "This is what the Lord, the God of Israel says£º 'Because you have prayed to me about King Sennacherib of Assyria, I have listened. 
122Kg 19:21 This is what the Lord has spoken against him£º 'She despises and mocks you, this virgin daughter of Zion! Behind your back she shakes her head, this daughter of Jerusalem!
122Kg 19:22 Who are you reproaching and blaspheming?Against whom have you raised your voice?And against whom have you lifted up your eyes in arrogance?Against the Holy One of Israel!
122Kg 19:23 By your messengers you have insulted the Lord. You have claimed, "With my many chariots I ascended the heights of the mountains, including the remotest regions of Lebanon; I cut down its tall cedars and the best of its cypress trees. I entered its most remote lodging place and its most fruitful forest.
122Kg 19:24 I myself dug for and drank foreign water. With the sole of my foot I dried up all the streams of Egypt!"
122Kg 19:25 "'Didn't you hear?I determined it years ago! I planned this from ancient times, and now I've brought it to pass, to turn fortified cities into piles of ruins
122Kg 19:26 while their inhabitants, lacking strength, stand dismayed and confused. They were like vegetation out in the fields, and like green herbs - just as grass that grows on a housetop dries out before it can grow.
122Kg 19:27 "'But when you sit down, when you go out, and when you come in, I'm aware of it!
122Kg 19:28 Because of your rage against me, your complacency has reached my ears. I'll put my hook into your nostrils and my bit into your mouth. Then I'll turn you back on the road by which you came.'"
122Kg 19:29 "This will serve as a sign for you£º you'll eat this year from what grows by itself, in the second year what grows from that, and in the third year you'll sow, reap, plant vineyards, and enjoy their fruit. 
122Kg 19:30 Those who survive from Judah's household will again put down deep roots and bear fruit extensively, 
122Kg 19:31 because a remnant will go out from Jerusalem, and survivors from Mount Zion. The zeal of the Lord will bring this about.
122Kg 19:32 "Therefore this is what the Lord says concerning the king of Assyria£º 'Not only will he not approach this city or shoot an arrow in its direction, he won't approach it with so much as a shield, nor will he throw up a siege ramp against it. 
122Kg 19:33 He'll return on the same route by which he came - he won't come to this city,' declares the Lord. 
122Kg 19:34 "I will defend this city and preserve it for my own reasons, and because of my servant David."
122Kg 19:35 That very night, the angel of the Lord went out to the camp of the Assyrian army and killed 185,000 men. Early the next morning, when the army of Israel arose, all 185,000 soldiers were dead corpses. 
122Kg 19:36 As a result, King Sennacherib of Assyria left and returned to Nineveh where he lived. 
122Kg 19:37 Later on, as he was worshiping in the temple of his god Nisroch, Adrammelech and Sharezer killed him with a sword and fled into the territory of Ararat. Then Sennacherib's son Esarhaddon became king in his place.
122Kg 20:1 During this time, Hezekiah became sick with a fatal illness, so Isaiah the prophet, the son of Amoz, approached him and told him, "This is what the Lord says£º 'Put your household in order, because you are dying. You will not survive.'"
122Kg 20:2 So Hezekiah turned his face to the wall and prayed to the Lord. 
122Kg 20:3 "Remember me, Lord," he said, "how I have walked in your presence with integrity, with an undivided heart, and I have accomplished what is good in your sight." And Hezekiah wept deeply.
122Kg 20:4 Before Isaiah had left the middle court, the word of the Lord came to him. 
122Kg 20:5 "Return to Hezekiah," he said, "and tell the commander-in-chief of my people£º 'This is what the Lord, the God of your ancestor David, says£º "I've heard your prayer and I've observed your tears. Look! I'm healing you. Three days from now you'll go visit the Lord's temple. 
122Kg 20:6 Furthermore, I'll add fifteen years to your life. I'll deliver you and this city from domination by the king of Assyria, and I'll defend this city for my own sake and for the sake of my servant David."'"
122Kg 20:7 Isaiah said, "Take a fig cake." So some attendants took it, laid it on Hezekiah's boil, and he recovered.
122Kg 20:8 Now Hezekiah had asked Isaiah, "What is to be the sign that the Lord is healing me and that I'll be going up to the Lord's temple three days from now?"
122Kg 20:9 So Isaiah replied, "This will be your sign from the Lord that the Lord will do what he has promised. Shall the shadow go forward ten steps or go back ten steps?"
122Kg 20:10 Hezekiah answered, "It's an easy thing for a shadow to lengthen ten steps. So let the shadow go backward ten steps."
122Kg 20:11 So Isaiah cried out to the Lord, who brought the shadow back ten steps after it had gone down the stairway of Ahaz.
122Kg 20:12 Some time later, Berodach-baladan, the son of King Baladan of Babylon, sent letters and a gift to Hezekiah, because he had heard that Hezekiah had been ill. 
122Kg 20:13 Hezekiah listened to the entourage and showed them his entire treasury, including the silver, gold, spices, the precious oil, his armory, and everything that was inventoried in his treasuries. There was nothing in his household or in his holdings that Hezekiah did not show them.
122Kg 20:14 Then Isaiah the prophet came to King Hezekiah and asked him, "What did these men have to say, and where did they come from?" Hezekiah replied, "They came from a country far away - from Babylon."
122Kg 20:15 He asked, "What did they see in your household?" Hezekiah answered, "They have seen everything. In my household there is nothing in my treasuries that I haven't shown them."
122Kg 20:16 Then Isaiah replied to Hezekiah, "Listen to the word of the Lord£º 
122Kg 20:17 'Watch out! The days are coming when everything that's in your house - everything that your ancestors have saved up right to this day - will be carried off to Babylon. Nothing will be left,' declares the Lord. 
122Kg 20:18 'Some of your descendants - your very own seed, whom you will father - will be carried away to become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon.'"
122Kg 20:19 At this, Hezekiah replied to Isaiah, "What you've spoken from the Lord is good," because he had been thinking, "Why not, as long as there's peace and security in my lifetime¡¦?"
122Kg 20:20 Now the rest of Hezekiah's actions, as well as his glorious deeds, including how he constructed the pool and the conduit to bring water into the city, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not?
122Kg 20:21 Hezekiah died, as did his ancestors, and his son Manasseh became king in his place.
122Kg 21:1 Manasseh began to reign at the age of twelve, and he reigned for 55 years in Jerusalem. His mother was named Hephzibah. 
122Kg 21:2 He did what the Lord considered to be evil, following the despicable practices of the nations whom the Lord had expelled in full view of the people of Israel. 
122Kg 21:3 He rebuilt the high places that his father Hezekiah had destroyed. He erected altars for Baal, crafted an Asherah, just as King Ahab of Israel had done, and worshipped and served the stars of heaven. 
122Kg 21:4 He also built altars in the Lord's temple, about which the Lord had said, "In Jerusalem I will place my Name." 
122Kg 21:5 He built two altars to every star in the heavens in the two courts of the Lord's temple. 
122Kg 21:6 He made his son into a burnt offering, practiced witchcraft, used divination, and consorted with mediums and spirit-channelers. He practiced many things that the Lord considered to be evil and provoked him.
122Kg 21:7 He also erected the carved image of Asherah that he had made inside the temple about which the Lord had spoken to David and to his son Solomon, "I will put my Name forever in this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen from all of the tribes of Israel. 
122Kg 21:8 And I will not make Israel's feet to wander anymore from the land that I have given to their ancestors, if they will only be careful to do everything that I have commanded them according to the entire law that my servant Moses commanded them." 
122Kg 21:9 But they would not listen. Manasseh led them astray to practice more evil than the nations whom the Lord had destroyed in the presence of the Israelites.7
122Kg 21:10 So the Lord announced through his prophets, 
122Kg 21:11 "Because King Manasseh of Judah has committed these despicable things, acting more sinfully than did all of the Amorites who preceded him, including making Judah sin with its idols, 
122Kg 21:12 therefore this is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'Look! I'm going to bring such a disaster to Jerusalem and Judah that both ears of those who hear about it will ring. 
122Kg 21:13 I'll stretch out over Jerusalem the measuring line that is Samaria and the plumb line that is Ahab's dynasty. Then I'll wipe Jerusalem like one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down! 
122Kg 21:14 I will abandon the survivors of my heritage and hand them over to their enemies. They will become war booty and spoil to all of their enemies 
122Kg 21:15 because they have done what I consider to be evil and they have provoked me from the day their ancestors left Egypt right up to this day!'"
122Kg 21:16 In addition to this, Manasseh shed lots of innocent blood - until he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides his sin by which he caused Judah to sin by practicing what the Lord considered to be evil. 
122Kg 21:17 The rest of Manasseh's deeds, including everything that he accomplished and the sin that he practiced, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not?
122Kg 21:18 Manasseh died, as did his ancestors, and he was buried in the garden at his home in the Garden of Uzza. His son Amon became king in his place.
122Kg 21:19 Amon began to reign at the age of 22, and ruled for two years in Jerusalem. His mother was named Meshullemeth, the daughter of Haruz of Jotbah. 
122Kg 21:20 He practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, just as his father Manasseh had done, 
122Kg 21:21 because he completely adopted his father's lifestyle, serving the same idols his father had served and worshiped. 
122Kg 21:22 As a result, he abandoned the Lord God of his ancestors and did not walk in the Lord's way. 
122Kg 21:23 Later on, Amon's staff conspired against him and killed the king inside his own home. 
122Kg 21:24 But afterward, the people of the land executed everyone who had conspired against King Amon, and the people of the land installed his son Josiah to be king in his place.
122Kg 21:25 Now the rest of Amon's activities that he undertook are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not?26He was buried in his own grave in the Garden of Uzza, and his son Josiah became king in his place.
122Kg 22:1 Josiah was an eight year old child when he began to reign, and he reigned for 31 years in Jerusalem. His mother was named Jedidah, the daughter of Adaiah of Boscath. 
122Kg 22:2 He practiced what the Lord considered to be right, living the way his ancestor David had lived, turning neither to the right nor to the left.
122Kg 22:3 Eighteen years after King Josiah had begun to reign, the king sent Azaliah's son Shaphan, grandson of Meshullam the scribe to the Lord's temple. He told him, 
122Kg 22:4 "Go to the high priest Hilkiah, so he can count the money that has been brought into the Lord's temple by the doorkeepers who have been gathering it from the people. 
122Kg 22:5 Have them deliver it to the workmen who are supervising the Lord's temple, so that they may pay it over to the workmen who serve in the Lord's temple to repair its damages, 
122Kg 22:6 including paying the carpenters, builders, and masons, as well as buying timber and pre-carved stone to repair the temple. 
122Kg 22:7 But you won't need to force them to be accountable for money already paid to them, since they're faithful."
122Kg 22:8 Later on, Hilkiah the high priest informed Shaphan the scribe, "I've discovered the Book of the Law in the Lord's temple." Hilkiah gave the book to Shaphan, and he began to read it.
122Kg 22:9 Shaphan the scribe reported to king Josiah, he brought up the matter to him and told him, "Your servants have distributed the money that was found in the temple by giving it to the workmen who supervise the Lord's temple." 
122Kg 22:10 Then Shaphan the scribe informed the king, "Hilkiah the priest has given me a book." Then Shaphan read from it in the king's presence.
122Kg 22:11 When the king heard what was written in the Book of the Law, he tore his clothes 
122Kg 22:12 and issued these orders to Hilkiah the priest, Shaphan's son Ahikam, Micaiah's son Achbor, Shaphan the scribe, and the king's servant Asaiah£º 
122Kg 22:13 "Go ask the Lord for me, for the people, and for all of Judah about what's written in this book that has been discovered, because the Lord's anger is burning against us, since our ancestors have not listened to the words written in this book and have not lived according to everything that is written concerning us."22
122Kg 22:14 So Hilkiah the priest, Ahikam, Achbor, Shaphan, and Asaiah went to the prophet Huldah, the wife of Tikvah's son Shallum, the grandson of Harhas and supervisor of the royal wardrobe, who lived in the Second Quarter in Jerusalem. They spoke with her, 
122Kg 22:15 and she told them, "This is what the Lord says£º 'Look! I'm bringing disaster on this place and on its inhabitants - everything written in the book that the king of Judah has read?
122Kg 22:17 because they have abandoned me and burned incense to other gods, they have provoked me to anger with everything that they have done. Therefore my anger is kindled against this place and it won't be quenched! 
122Kg 22:18 Nevertheless, tell the king of Judah who sent you to ask the Lord about this£º "This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'Now about what you've heard, 
122Kg 22:19 because your heart was sensitive, and you humbled yourself in the Lord's presence when you heard what I had to say against this place and against its inhabitants - that they would become a desolation and a curse - and you have torn your clothes and cried out before me, be assured that I have truly heard you,' declares the Lord. 
122Kg 22:20 'Therefore, look! I will gather you to your ancestors, and you will be placed in your grave in peace. Your eyes will never see all the evil that I will bring on this place.'"'" 22
122Kg 23:1 At this, the king sent for and gathered together all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
122Kg 23:2 The king went up to the Lord's temple, accompanied by all the men of Judah, everyone who lived in Jerusalem, the priests, the prophets, and everyone - including those who were unimportant and those who were important - and he read to them everything written in the Book of the Covenant that had been discovered in the Lord's temple. 
122Kg 23:3 The king stood beside a pillar and made a covenant in the presence of the Lord, to follow after the Lord, to keep his commandments, his testimonies, and his statutes with all of his heart and soul, and to carry out what was written in the covenant contained in the book. All the people consented to enter into the covenant.
122Kg 23:4 The king ordered Hilkiah the high priest, the priests of the secondary order, and the doorkeepers to take out of the Lord's temple all of the implements that had been crafted for Baal, for Asherah, and for every star in the heavens. Then he burned them outside Jerusalem in the fields of the Kidron and carried the ashes to Bethel. 
122Kg 23:5 The king unseated the idolatrous priests whom the kings of Judah had appointed to burn incense in the high places throughout the cities of Judah and in the environs surrounding Jerusalem, including those who had been burning incense to Baal, to the sun, to the moon, to the constellations, and to every star in the heavens. 
122Kg 23:6 He brought the Asherah from the Lord's temple to the Kidron Brook outside Jerusalem, burned it at the Kidron brook, pulverized the ashes to dust, and scattered it over the graves of the common people.
122Kg 23:7 He also demolished the temples of the cultic male prostitutes that had been operating in the Lord's temple, where the women had been doing weaving for the Asherah. 
122Kg 23:8 Then he gathered together all the priests from the cities of Judah and defiled the high places from Geba to Beersheba, where the priests had burned incense. He also demolished the high places of the gates that had been erected to the left as one enters the city gate - that is, near the entrance operated by Joshua, the governor of the city. 
122Kg 23:9 Nevertheless, the priests of the high places did not approach the Lord's altar in Jerusalem, but instead they ate unleavened bread given to them by their relatives.
122Kg 23:10 He also defiled Topheth, which is located in the Benne-Hinnom Valley, so that no one would force his son or daughter to pass through the fire in dedication to Molech. 
122Kg 23:11 He abolished the horses that the kings of Judah had dedicated to the sun at the entrance to the Lord's temple, near the offices of Nathan-melech, the official, that was in the precincts. He also set fire to the chariots of the sun.
122Kg 23:12 The king demolished the rooftop altars on top of Ahaz's upper chamber that the kings of Judah had erected, as well as the altars that Manasseh had made in the two courts of the Lord's temple. He pulverized them where they stood and cast their dust into the Kidron Brook. 
122Kg 23:13 The king defiled the high places which faced Jerusalem on the south side of Corruption Mountain, which King Solomon of Israel had constructed for Ashtoreth, the Sidonian abomination, for Chemosh, the Moabite abomination, and for Milcom, the Ammonite abomination. 
122Kg 23:14 He broke the pillars to pieces, cut down the Asherim, and filled their locations with human bones.
122Kg 23:15 Furthermore, he even broke down the altar that had been at Bethel as well as the high place constructed by Nebat's son Jeroboam, who had caused Israel to sin. He demolished its stones, pulverized them to dust, and burned the Asherah. 
122Kg 23:16 As Josiah turned around, he observed the graves located there on the mountain, so he sent for and recovered the bones from the graves and burned them on the altar to defile it, in keeping with the word of the Lord that the godly man had proclaimed when he was declaring these things. 
122Kg 23:17 He asked, "What is this monument that I'm looking at?" The men who lived in that city answered him, "It's the grave of that godly man who came from Judah and predicted these things that you've done against the altar at Bethel!"
122Kg 23:18 Josiah replied, "Leave him alone. No one is to disturb his bones." So they preserved his bones undisturbed, along with the bones of the prophet who had come from Samaria. 
122Kg 23:19 Josiah also removed all of the temples on the high places that had been in the cities of Samaria and that the kings of Israel had erected, thereby provoking the Lord. He treated Samaria just as he had Bethel. 
122Kg 23:20 After he had slaughtered all the priests who served at the high places and burned their bones on those high places, he returned to Jerusalem.
122Kg 23:21 After this, the king commanded all of the people, "Celebrate the Passover to the Lord your God, just as it's prescribed in this Book of the Covenant." 
122Kg 23:22 From the days of the judges who ruled in Israel, no Passover had been celebrated like this, not even in all the reigns of the kings of Israel and the kings of Judah. 
122Kg 23:23 In the eighteenth year of the reign of King Josiah, this Passover was observed in Jerusalem to honor the Lord. 
122Kg 23:24 Furthermore, Josiah removed the mediums, the necromancers, the household gods, the idols, and every despicable thing that could be seen in the territory of Judah and in Jerusalem, so that he might confirm the words of the law that had been written in the book that Hilkiah the priest had discovered in the Lord's temple. 
122Kg 23:25 There had been no king like him before him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, with all his soul, and with all his strength, in obeying everything in the law of Moses. No king arose like Josiah after him.
122Kg 23:26 Even so, the Lord did not turn away from his fierce and great anger that burned against Judah because of everything with which Manasseh had provoked him. 
122Kg 23:27 The Lord said, "I'm going to remove Judah from my sight as well, just as I've removed Israel. I will abandon Jerusalem, this city that I've chosen, as well as the temple about which I've spoken 'My Name shall remain there.'"
122Kg 23:28 Now the rest of Josiah's actions, including everything that he did, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not?
122Kg 23:29 During his reign, Pharaoh Neco, king of Egypt, marched out toward the Euphrates River to meet the king of Assyria. King Josiah went out to engage him in battle, but Pharaoh Neco killed him at Megiddo as soon as he saw him. 
122Kg 23:30 Josiah's servants drove his corpse in a chariot from Megiddo to Jerusalem and buried him in a tomb made for him. The people of the land took Josiah's son Jehoahaz, anointed him, and installed him as king in his father's place. 
122Kg 23:31 Jehoahaz was 23 years old when he became king. He reigned three months in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Hamutal. She was the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
122Kg 23:32 He practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, just as all of his ancestors had done. 
122Kg 23:33 Pharaoah Neco placed him in custody at Riblah in the land of Hamath so that he would not reign in Jerusalem, and imposed a tribute of 100 talents of silver and a talent of gold.2331
122Kg 23:34 Pharaoh Neco installed Josiah's son Eliakim as king to replace his father Josiah and changed his name to Jehoiakim. He transported Jehoahaz off to Egypt, where he died. 
122Kg 23:35 As a result, Jehoiakim paid the silver and gold tribute to Pharaoh, but he passed on the costs to the inhabitants of the land in taxes, in keeping with Pharaoh's orders. He exacted the silver and gold from the people who lived in the land, from each according to his assessment, in order to pay it to Pharaoh Neco. 
122Kg 23:36 Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. His mother was named Zebidah. She was the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah. 
122Kg 23:37 Eliakim practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, just as his ancestors had done.
122Kg 24:1 During his lifetime, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked Jehoiakim, who became his vassal for three years, after which he turned against Nebuchadnezzar and rebelled. 
122Kg 24:2 The Lord sent raiding parties from the Chaldeans, Arameans, Moabites, and Ammonites against Jehoiakim. He sent them against Judah to destroy it, in keeping with the word of the Lord that he had spoken through his servants, the prophets. 
122Kg 24:3 It was truly by the command of the Lord against Judah that it came, in order to remove them from his sight, because of every sin that Manasseh had committed, 
122Kg 24:4 as well as for the innocent blood that he had shed. He had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and the Lord would not forgive them. 
122Kg 24:5 Now the rest of Jehoiakim's actions, and everything that he undertook, are recorded in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah, are they not?
122Kg 24:6 Jehoiakim died, as did his ancestors, and his son Jehoiachin became king in his place. 
122Kg 24:7 The king of Egypt did not leave his territory again, because the king of Babylon had taken everything that belonged to the king of Egypt from the Wadi of Egypt to the Euphrates River.
122Kg 24:8 Jehoiachin became king at the age of eighteen years, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem. His mother was named Hausa. She was the daughter of Elzaphan of Jerusalem. 
122Kg 24:9 He practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, just as his ancestors had done. 
122Kg 24:10 At that time, the servants of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked Jerusalem and the city was placed under siege. 
122Kg 24:11 King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon came up against the city, along with his servants, who besieged it. 
122Kg 24:12 King Jehoiachin of Judah surrendered to the king of Babylon, as did his mother, his servants, his princes, and his officers, during the eighth year of his reign.824
122Kg 24:13 Nebuchadnezzar carried off from there all of the treasures of the Lord's temple, along with the treasures in the king's palace. He cut into pieces all the gold vessels in the Lord's temple that King Solomon of Israel had made, just as the Lord had said would happen. 
122Kg 24:14 Then Nebuchadnezzar sent away into exile all of Jerusalem - all the captains, all the valiant soldiers, 10,000 captives, and all of the craftsmen and ironworkers. Nobody remained except the poorest people of the land. 
122Kg 24:15 He sent Jehoiachin into exile to Babylon, along with the king's mother, the king's wives, his officials, and the leading men of the land. He took them into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon. 
122Kg 24:16 All 7,000 of the most valiant soldiers, 1,000 of the craftsmen and ironworkers, all physically fit and trained for battle were brought by the king of Babylon into exile in Babylon.
122Kg 24:17 The king of Babylon installed Jehoiachin's uncle Mattaniah as king in his place and then changed his name to Zedekiah. 
122Kg 24:18 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king. He reigned for eleven yeas in Jerusalem. His mother was named Hamutal. She was the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah. 
122Kg 24:19 Zedekiah practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, just as Jehoiakim had done, 
122Kg 24:20 because through the Lord's anger these things happened to Jerusalem and Judah until he threw them from his presence. Zedekiah then rebelled against the king of Babylon, 
122Kg 25:1 so on the tenth day of the tenth month of the ninth year of Nebuchadnezzar's reign as king of Babylon, he and his entire army approached Jerusalem, attacked it, encamped against it, and built a siege wall that surrounded the city. 
122Kg 25:2 The city remained under siege until the eleventh year of the reign of King Zedekiah. 
122Kg 25:3 By the ninth day of the fourth month, the resulting famine had become so severe in the city that no food remained for the people who lived in the land. 
122Kg 25:4 The city was breached, and the entire army left during the night through the gate that stood between the two walls beside the royal garden, even though the Chaldeans had surrounded the city. They escaped by way of the Arabah, 
122Kg 25:5 but the Chaldean army pursued the king and overtook him in the Jericho plains, where his entire army was scattered. 
122Kg 25:6 The Chaldeans captured the king, brought him to Riblah, where the king of Babylon determined his sentence. 
122Kg 25:7 They executed Zedekiah's sons in his presence, blinded Zedekiah, bound him with bronze chains, and transported him to Babylon.
122Kg 25:8 On the seventh day of the fifth month, which was during the nineteenth year of King Nebuchadnezzar's reign as king of Babylon, captain of the guard Nebuzaradan, a servant of the king of Babylon, arrived in Jerusalem, 
122Kg 25:9 set fire to the Lord's temple, the royal palace, and all the houses of Jerusalem. He even set fire to the lavish homes. 
122Kg 25:10 The Chaldean army that accompanied the captain of the guard demolished the walls that surrounded Jerusalem. 
122Kg 25:11 Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, carried the survivors of the people who remained in the city, those who had deserted to the king of Babylon, and the rest of the multitude into exile. 
122Kg 25:12 However, the captain of the guard left some of the poor people of the land to work as vinedressers and farmers.
122Kg 25:13 The Chaldeans also broke into pieces and carried back to Babylon the bronze pillars that stood in the Lord's temple, along with the stands and the bronze sea that used to be in the Lord's temple. 
122Kg 25:14 They also confiscated the pots, shovels, snuffers, spoons, and the rest of the bronze vessels that were used in ministry. 
122Kg 25:15 The captain of the guard also confiscated the fire pans, basins, and whatever had been crafted of pure gold and pure silver. 
122Kg 25:16 The bronze contained in the two pillars, the one sea, and the stands that Solomon had crafted for the Lord's temple could not be inventoried for weight. 
122Kg 25:17 The height of one of the pillars was 24 feet, and the capital on top of it was four and a half feet high. A latticework carved in the form of pomegranates encircled the capital, crafted completely out of brass. The second pillar was identical to the first.
122Kg 25:18 The captain of the guard arrested Seraiah the chief priest, Zephaniah the second priest, three temple officials, 
122Kg 25:19 one overseer from the city who supervised the soldiers, five of the king's advisors who had been discovered in the city, the scribe who served the army captain who mustered the army of the land, and 60 men of the land who were discovered in the city. 
122Kg 25:20 Nebuzaradan the captain of the guard took them to the king of Babylon at Riblah, 
122Kg 25:21 where the king of Babylon executed them in the land of Hamath. And so Judah was transported into exile from the land.19
122Kg 25:22 Now as for the people who remained in the land of Judah whom King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon had left behind, he appointed Ahikam's son Gedaliah, the grandson of Shaphan, to rule. 
122Kg 25:23 When all the captains of the armies, along with their men, heard that the king of Babylon had appointed Gedaliah, these men visited Gedaliah at Mizpah£º Nethaniah's son Ishmael, Careah's son Johanan, Tanhumeth the Netophathite's son Seraiah, and Jaazanaiah, who was descended from the Maacathites. 
122Kg 25:24 Gedaliah made this promise to them and to their men£º "Don't be afraid of the servants of the Chaldeans. Live in the land and serve the king of Babylon, and things will go well with you." 
122Kg 25:25 Nevertheless, seven months later Nethaniah's son Ishmael, the grandson of Elishama from the royal family, came with ten men and attacked Gedaliah. As a result, he died along with the Jews and Chaldeans who were with him at Mizpah. 
122Kg 25:26 Then all the people, including those who were insignificant and those who were important, fled with the captains of the armed forces to Egypt, because they were afraid of the Chaldeans.23
122Kg 25:27 Later on, after King Jehoiachin of Judah had been in exile for 37 years, on the twenty-seventh day of the twelfth month, during the first year of his reign King Evil-merodach of Babylon released King Jehoiachin of Judah from prison. 
122Kg 25:28 He spoke kindly to him, and elevated his position above the thrones of the kings with him in Babylon. 
122Kg 25:29 Jehoiachin changed out of his prison clothes and had regular meals in the king's presence every day for the rest of his life, 
122Kg 25:30 and a regular stipend was provided to him by the king in accordance with his needs for as long as he lived.

131Ch 5:21 They captured 50,000 camels, 250,000 sheep, 2,000 donkeys, and 100,000 war captives from their possessions.

131Ch 5:26 So the God of Israel incited King Pul of Assyria (also known as King Tilgath-pilneser of Assyria), who took them prisoner and brought the Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half-tribe of Manasseh to Halah, Habor, Hara, and to the Gozan River, where they remain to this day.524

131Ch 9:25 Their relatives who lived in their villages were required to visit every seven days to be with them in turn,

131Ch 10:1 The Philistines were fighting against Israel, and each soldier of Israel fled before the Philistines. They fell slain on the mountain of Gilboa. 
131Ch 10:2 The Philistines followed after Saul and after his sons, and the Philistines struck down Jonathan, Abinadib, and Malchishua, Saul's sons. 
131Ch 10:3 The heaviest fighting was against Saul, and when the archers who were shooting located Saul, he was gravely wounded by them. 
131Ch 10:4 Saul ordered his armor bearer, "Draw your sword and run me through with it, or these uncircumcised people will come and abuse me." But his armor bearer did not want to do it because he was very frightened, so Saul took the sword and fell on it. 
131Ch 10:5 When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died. 
131Ch 10:6 Therefore Saul, his three sons, and all his entire household died together. 
131Ch 10:7 When that part of the army of Israel that was in the valley saw that the rest of the army of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned their cities and fled, and the Philistines came and occupied them.10
131Ch 10:8 The Philistines came to strip the dead the next day, and they found Saul dead on Gilboa mountain, along with his sons. 
131Ch 10:9 They stripped him, took his head and armor, and sent messengers throughout the territory of the Philistines to report the news to their idols and to the people. 
131Ch 10:10 Then they put Saul's armor in the temple of their gods and fastened his skull to the wall of the temple of Dagon.
131Ch 10:11 When all the residents of Jabesh-gilead heard everything that the Philistines had done to Saul, 
131Ch 10:12 every valiant soldier got up, removed the bodies of Saul and his sons, took them to Jabesh, and buried their bones under the tamarisk tree in Jabesh. Then they fasted for seven days. 
131Ch 10:13 So Saul died for his transgressions; that is, he acted unfaithfully to the Lord by transgressing the word of the Lord (which he did not keep), by consulting a medium for advice, 
131Ch 10:14 and by not seeking counsel from the Lord, who therefore put him to death and turned the kingdom over to Jesse's son David.1013
131Ch 11:1 Later on, all of Israel gathered together at Hebron in order to tell David, "Look, we're your own flesh and blood! 
131Ch 11:2 Even back when Saul was ruling as king, you kept on leading the army of Israel out to battle and bringing them in again. The Lord your God said to you, 'You yourself will shepherd my people Israel and shall be commander-in-chief over my people Israel.'" 
131Ch 11:3 So all the elders of Israel approached the king at Hebron, where David entered into a covenant in the presence of the Lord. Then they anointed David to be king over Israel, just as the Lord had sent word through Samuel.
131Ch 11:4 Later, David and all of Israel marched to Jerusalem (then known as Jebus, where the Jebusites lived when they inhabited the land). 
131Ch 11:5 The inhabitants of Jebus told David, "You're not coming in here!" Nevertheless, David captured the fortress of Zion, now known as the city of David.
131Ch 11:6 David had announced, "Whoever first attacks the Jebusites shall be appointed chief and commander." When Zeruiah's son Joab went up first, he became chief. 
131Ch 11:7 David occupied the fortress, so it was named the City of David after him. 
131Ch 11:8 He built up the walls surrounding the city in a complete circle from the terrace ramparts, and Joab repaired the rest of the city. 
131Ch 11:9 David became more and more prestigious because the Lord of the Heavenly Armies was with him.
131Ch 11:10 These are the leaders of the elite warriors who were strong supporters of David in his kingdom, along with all of Israel, in keeping with the word of the Lord concerning Israel. 
131Ch 11:11 This record of the warriors who were for David included Hachmoni's son Jashobeam, leader of the platoons, who killed 300 with his spear in a single encounter.
131Ch 11:12 Next to him among the Three was Dodo the Ahohite's son Eleazar. 
131Ch 11:13 He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were there to engage them in battle. There was a field planted with barley, and the army had run away from the Philistines, 
131Ch 11:14 but they took a defensive stand in the middle of the field and killed the Philistines while the Lord saved them by means of a great victory.
131Ch 11:15 Later, the Three platoon leaders went down to David's hideout at the cave of Adullam when the Philistine army was camping in the valley of giants. 
131Ch 11:16 David was living in that stronghold at the time, while a Philistine garrison was then at Bethlehem. 
131Ch 11:17 David expressed a longing, "Oh, how I wish someone would get me a drink of water from the Bethlehem well that's by the city gate!" 
131Ch 11:18 So the Three broke through the Philistine ranks, drew some water from the Bethlehem well that was next to the city gate, and brought it back to David. But David refused to drink it, poured it out in the Lord's presence, and 
131Ch 11:19 said in response, "May God forbid me to do this! I won't drink the blood of these men, will I?After all, they risked their lives to bring it to me." That's why he wouldn't drink it. The Three warriors did these things.18
131Ch 11:20 Joab's brother Abishai was the lieutenant in charge of the platoons. He used his spear to fight and kill 300 men, gaining a reputation distinct from the Three. 
131Ch 11:21 He was more well known than the Three, but he never attained the stature of the Three.
131Ch 11:22 Jehoiada's son Benaiah, who was a valiant man, accomplished great things. He was from Kabzeel. He killed two men named Ariel from Moab and then he also went down into a pit and struck down a lion during a snow storm one day. 
131Ch 11:23 He also killed a soldier from Egypt of enormous height - seven and a half feet tall. The Egyptian carried a spear comparable in size to a weaver's beam, but Benaiah attacked him with a staff, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian's hand and killed him with his own spear. 
131Ch 11:24 Benaiah did things like this and gained a reputation comparable to the Three warriors. 
131Ch 11:25 He was well known among the platoons, but he didn't measure up to the Three. David placed him in charge of his security detail.11
131Ch 11:26 The elite forces included Asahel (Joab's brother), Dodo's son Elhanan from Bethlehem, 
131Ch 11:27 Shammoth from Haror, Helez the Pelonite,

131Ch 11:44 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Hotham the Aroerite's sons Shama and Jeiel,

131Ch 11:47 Eliel, Obed, and Jaasiel the Mezobaite.
131Ch 12:1 Here's a list of those who came to David at Ziklag when he was unable to travel freely due to Saul son of Kish. They were among the elite soldiers who assisted him in battle. 
131Ch 12:2 Equipped as archers, they could use both their right and left hands to shoot arrows and hurl stones. As Benjaminites, they were Saul's relatives. 
131Ch 12:3 Their leaders were Shemaah's sons Ahiezer and Joash from Gibeah, Azmaveth's sons Jeziel and Pelet, Beracah, Jehu from Anathoth, 
131Ch 12:4 Ishmaiah from Gibeon (who was a one of the elite among the Thirty and in charge over them), Jeremiah, - ?Jahaziel, Johanan, Jozabad from Gederah,

131Ch 12:6 Elkanah, Isshiah, Azarel, Joezer, Jashobeam, the Korahites, 
131Ch 12:7 and Jeroham's sons Joelah and Zebadiah from Gedor.5
131Ch 12:8 Mighty and experienced warriors from the Gadites joined David at his wilderness stronghold. They were expert handlers of both shield and spear, with hardened looks and as agile as a gazelle on a mountain slope. 
131Ch 12:9 Their leader was Ezer, Obadiah was second, Eliab third, 
131Ch 12:10 Mishmannah fourth, Jeremiah fifth, 
131Ch 12:11 Attai sixth, Eliel seventh, 
131Ch 12:12 Johanan eighth, Elzabad ninth, 
131Ch 12:13 Jeremiah tenth, and Machbannai eleventh. 
131Ch 12:14 These Gadites were army leaders. The least of them was equal to a hundred other soldiers and the greatest to a thousand. 
131Ch 12:15 These men crossed the Jordan in the first month of the year during flood season and chased out everyone in the valleys, to the east and to the west.12
131Ch 12:16 Later, some Benjaminites and Judahites approached David at his stronghold, 
131Ch 12:17 and David went out to meet them. He said to them, "If you've come in peace to be of help me, then you'll have my commitment. But if you've come to betray me to my enemies, even though I'm innocent of wrongdoing, then may the God of our ancestors watch and judge."
131Ch 12:18 Then the Spirit came upon Amasai, leader of the Thirty, and he said, "David, we belong to you; we're with you, son of Jesse! Peace, peace to you, and peace to the one who helps you! For your deliverer is your God." So David received them and assigned them to be officers over troops. 
131Ch 12:19 Some of the Manassites joined David when he was going to fight against Saul, accompanied by the Philistines. Even so, David was of no help to them, because the Philistine rulers were counseled to send him away. They said to themselves, "He's going to go over to his master Saul at the cost of our heads."
131Ch 12:20 As he traveled toward Ziklag, these Manassites joined him£º Adnah, Jozabad, Jediael, Michael, Jozabad, Elihu, and Zillethai, leaders in charge thousands in Manasseh. 
131Ch 12:21 They helped David against raiders, - ?since they were all warriors and commanders in the army. 
131Ch 12:22 Indeed people kept coming to David every day to help him, until his army became a great, vast army.
131Ch 12:23 What follows is a listing of the divisions of battle-ready troops who joined David in Hebron to turn the kingdom of Saul over to him, in accordance with what the Lord had spoken. 
131Ch 12:24 The army of Judah, equipped with both shields and spears, numbered 6,800 warriors,

131Ch 12:30 The tribe of Ephraim supplied 20,800 valiant soldiers who were well known in their ancestral households.
131Ch 12:31 The half-tribe of Manasseh supplied 18,000, who had been appointed specifically to come and establish David as king.
131Ch 12:32 The tribe of Issachar supplied 200 leaders, along with all of their relatives under their command. They kept up-to-date in their understanding of the times and knew what Israel should do.
131Ch 12:33 The tribe of Zebulun supplied 50,000 experienced troops, trained in the use of every kind of war weapon, in order to help David - ?with undivided loyalty.
131Ch 12:34 The tribe of Naphtali supplied 1,000 commanders, accompanied by 37,000 troops armed with shields and spears.
131Ch 12:35 The tribe of Dan supplied 28,600 battle-ready troops.
131Ch 12:36 The tribe of Asher supplied 40,000 experienced, battle-ready troops.12
131Ch 12:37 The tribes of Reuben and Gad, along with the half-tribe of Manasseh east of the Jordan supplied 120,000 men armed with every kind of war weapon.
131Ch 12:38 All these warriors arrived in battle order at Hebron, fully intending to establish David as king over all Israel. Furthermore, all of the rest of Israel were united in their intent to make David king. 
131Ch 12:39 They spent three days eating and drinking with David, since their relatives had supplied provisions for them.
131Ch 12:40 Their neighbors came from as far away as the territories of Issachar, Zebulun, and Naphtali, bringing provisions loaded on donkeys, camels, mules, and oxen. They brought abundant provisions of meal, fig bars, raisins, wine, oil, oxen, and sheep, because there was joy in Israel.
131Ch 13:1 Later, David conferred with every officer in charge of groups of thousands and groups of hundreds. 
131Ch 13:2 Then he addressed the entire community of Israel, "If it seems good to you and something from the Lord our God, let's spread word to all of our relatives who remain throughout the entire land of Israel, including the priests and Levites in the cities and pasture lands, so they can gather together with us. 
131Ch 13:3 Then let's bring the ark of God back to us, because we didn't consult it during Saul's reign." 
131Ch 13:4 The entire community consented, because doing so pleased all the people. 
131Ch 13:5 So David assembled all of Israel - from the Shihor River of Egypt to Lebo-hamath - in order to bring the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim.
131Ch 13:6 David, accompanied by all of Israel, went up to Baalah (the former name of Kiriath-jearim), which belonged to Judah, to bring from there the ark of God, the Lord, who sits enthroned on the cherubim, and who is called the Name. 
131Ch 13:7 They mounted the ark of God on a new cart, bringing it from Abinadab's home, with Uzzah and Ahio driving the cart. 
131Ch 13:8 David and all of Israel were dancing in the presence of God with all of their might with songs, harps, tambourines, cymbals, and trumpets. 
131Ch 13:9 As they approached Chidon's threshing floor, Uzzah put out his hand to steady the ark, because the oxen had stumbled. 
131Ch 13:10 Just then, the anger of the Lord blazed against Uzzah, and he struck him down because he had put his hand on the ark, and he died right there in the presence of God.
131Ch 13:11 David flew into a rage because the Lord had killed Uzzah. As a result, that place was called Perez-uzzah to this day. 
131Ch 13:12 But David feared God that day, and asked "How am I to bring the ark of God to me?" 
131Ch 13:13 As a result, David would not take the ark into the city of David for it to be in his care. Instead, he took it to the home of Obed-edom the Gittite. 
131Ch 13:14 So the ark of God remained in the care of Obed-edom's household for three months, and God blessed Obed-edom's household, along with everyone associated with it.
131Ch 14:1 After this, King Hiram of Tyre sent a delegation to David, accompanied by cedar logs, stone masons, and wood workers, to construct a palace for him. 
131Ch 14:2 David realized that the Lord was affirming him as king over Israel, and that his government was being exalted in order to benefit his people Israel. 
131Ch 14:3 But while he was living in Jerusalem, David married more wives and fathered more sons and daughters. 
131Ch 14:4 Here's a list of the children whom he fathered while in Jerusalem£º Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 
131Ch 14:5 Ibhar, Elishua, Elpelet, 
131Ch 14:6 Nogah, Nepheg, Japhia, 
131Ch 14:7 Elishama, Beeliada, and Eliphelet.6
131Ch 14:8 When the Philistines learned that David had been anointed king over all of Israel, all of the Philistines invaded to look for David. David heard about it and went out to fight them. 
131Ch 14:9 Meanwhile, the Philistines had invaded and raided the Rephaim Valley. 
131Ch 14:10 So David asked God, "Am I to go out against the Philistines?Will you give me victory over them?" "Go out," the Lord replied to him, "and I'll put them right into your hand."14
131Ch 14:11 So David went out to Baal-perazim and defeated the Philistines there. David observed, "Like an overwhelming flood, God has overwhelmed my enemies, using me to do it." That's why that place is called Baal-perazim. 
131Ch 14:12 The Philistines abandoned their gods there, so David ordered that their idols be incinerated.
131Ch 14:13 Later the Philistines invaded the Rephaim Valley again. 
131Ch 14:14 When David asked God about it, God told him, "Don't directly attack them. Instead, go around them and come up against them opposite those balsam trees. 
131Ch 14:15 When you hear the sound of marching coming from the tops of the balsam trees, then go out to battle, because God will have gone out ahead of you to destroy the Philistine army." 
131Ch 14:16 So David did just as God had ordered, and they struck down the Philistine army from Gibeon to Gezer. 
131Ch 14:17 Then David's reputation spread through all of the neighboring countries, and the Lord caused all nations to be afraid of David.14
131Ch 15:1 David built palaces for himself in the city of David, and he prepared a place for the ark of God and erected a tent for it. 
131Ch 15:2 Then David ordered that the ark of God was to be carried by no one except the Levites, because the Lord had chosen them to carry the ark of the Lord and to serve him forever. 
131Ch 15:3 David assembled all of Israel in Jerusalem to bring up the ark of the Lord to its proper place that he had prepared for it.
131Ch 15:4 David also assembled the descendants of Aaron, who were Levites, 
131Ch 15:5 including Uriel their leader from the descendants of Kohath, along with 120 of his relatives, 
131Ch 15:6 from the descendants of Merari, Asaiah their leader, along with 220 of his relatives, 
131Ch 15:7 from the descendants of Gershom, Joel their chief, along with 130 of his relatives, 
131Ch 15:8 from the descendants of Elizaphan, Shemaiah their leader, along with 200 of his relatives, 
131Ch 15:9 from Hebron's descendants, Eliel their leader, along with 80 of his relatives, 
131Ch 15:10 and from Uzziel's descendants, Amminadab their leader, along with 112 of his relatives.
131Ch 15:11 Then David summoned the priests Zadok and Abiathar, along with the Levites Uriel, Asaiah, Joel, Shemaiah, Eliel, and Amminadab 
131Ch 15:12 and addressed them£º "As leaders of your Levitical families, set yourselves apart, both you and your relatives, so you can be qualified to bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel to the place I've prepared for it. 
131Ch 15:13 Because you didn't carry it from the very first, the Lord our God attacked us, since we didn't care for it appropriately." 
131Ch 15:14 So the priests and Levites set themselves apart to carry the ark of the Lord God of Israel. 
131Ch 15:15 The Levites carried the ark of God the way Moses had commanded and in accordance with the word of the Lord - that is, with poles on their shoulders.
131Ch 15:16 David also told the Levite leaders to appoint their relatives as singers, to play musical instruments such as harps, lyres, and cymbals, and to keep sounding aloud with joyful voices. 
131Ch 15:17 So the Levites appointed Joel's son Heman, his relative Berechiah's son Asaph, as well as certain relatives of Merari's sons, including Kushaiah's son Ethan, 
131Ch 15:18 their second order relatives Zechariah, Jaaziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, and Mikneiah, as well as the trustees Obed-edom and Jeiel. 
131Ch 15:19 The singers included Heman, Asaph, and Ethan (who played bronze cymbals). 
131Ch 15:20 Zechariah, Aziel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Unni, Eliab, Maaseiah, and Benaiah played harps to accompany the women singers, 
131Ch 15:21 and Mattithiah, Eliphelehu, Mikneiah, Obed-edom, Jeiel, and Azaziah led on lyres, sounding the octaves. 
131Ch 15:22 Chenaniah, music leader for the Levites, served as music director, because he was expert at it. 
131Ch 15:23 Berechiah and Elkanah served as gatekeepers for the ark. 
131Ch 15:24 Shebaniah, Joshaphat, Nethanel, Amasai, Zechariah, Benaiah, and Eliezer the priests were appointed to sound the trumpets before the ark of God, and Obed-edom and Jehiah were trustees for the ark.20
131Ch 15:25 Then David, the elders of Israel, and the leaders of groups of thousands proceeded to bring the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Obed-edom's house, rejoicing as they went. 
131Ch 15:26 As God helped the Levites who were carrying the ark of the covenant of the Lord, they sacrificed seven bulls and seven rams. 
131Ch 15:27 David wore a robe made from fine linen, as did all of the Levites who were carrying the ark, the singers, and Chenaniah the music and choir director. David also wore a linen ephod. 
131Ch 15:28 All of Israel were bringing up the ark of the covenant of the Lord, accompanied by shouting, sounding of horns, trumpets, and cymbals, along with loud music on harps and lyres. 
131Ch 15:29 But as the ark of the covenant of the Lord approached the city of David, Saul's daughter Michal was peering out a window, watching King David dancing and cavorting around, and she despised him in her heart.1525
131Ch 16:1 They brought the ark of God, placed it within the tent that David had erected, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings in the presence of God. 
131Ch 16:2 After David had finished sacrificing the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the Lord 
131Ch 16:3 and distributed a loaf of bread, a date bar, and a raisin bar to every person in Israel - that is, to each man and to each woman. 
131Ch 16:4 In the presence of the ark of the Lord, he appointed some of the Levites to minister continually by remembering, giving thanks, and praising the Lord God of Israel. 
131Ch 16:5 Their director Asaph played cymbals, and next to him was Zechariah, followed by Jeiel, Shemiramoth, Jehiel, Mattithiah, Eliab, Benaiah, Obed-edom, and Jeiel, who played harps and lyres. 
131Ch 16:6 The priests Benaiah and Jahaziel continually played the trumpets in the presence of the ark of the covenant of God.
131Ch 16:7 On that very day, David composed this psalm of thanksgiving to the Lord just for Asaph and his companions:
131Ch 16:8 Give thanks to the Lord, calling on his name. Make what he has done known among the people.
131Ch 16:9 Sing to him, sing psalms to him, and think about all of his miraculous deeds.
131Ch 16:10 Find joy in his holy name; let the hearts of those who keep on seeking the Lord rejoice.
131Ch 16:11 Seek the Lord and his strength. Always look to him.
131Ch 16:12 Keep remembering the awesome deeds that he has done, along with his miracles and the rulings that he has handed down,
131Ch 16:13 you descendants of his servant Israel, you descendants of Jacob, the ones he has chosen.
131Ch 16:14 He is the Lord our God. His justice is in all of the land.
131Ch 16:15 Remember his covenant forever, his promise that he made to the thousandth generation,
131Ch 16:16 the covenant that he made with Abraham, and the oath he swore to Isaac.
131Ch 16:17 He confirmed it to Jacob in the form of an ordinance, an eternal covenant to Israel,
131Ch 16:18 when he said to Israel, "To you I will give the land of Canaan as your joyful inheritance."
131Ch 16:19 When you were few in number - very few, and strangers at that - 
131Ch 16:20 wandering from nation to nation, from one kingdom to another,
131Ch 16:21 he did not let anyone wrong them. He warned kings on their behalf,
131Ch 16:22 "Don't touch my chosen ones, and don't hurt my prophets!"
131Ch 16:23 Let all the earth sing to the Lord! Day after day proclaim his deliverance!
131Ch 16:24 Declare his glory among the nations, and his miraculous deeds to all people,
131Ch 16:25 because the Lord is great, and he is praised greatly! He is feared above every god.
131Ch 16:26 For all of the gods of the other nations are mere idols, but the Lord fashioned the heavens!
131Ch 16:27 Splendor and majesty surround him, and strength and joy fill his palace.
131Ch 16:28 Let the families of earth recognize the Lord - that he is glorious and powerful.
131Ch 16:29 Recognize the glory that is due the Lord! Bring your offering, and come into his presence, worshiping the Lord in all of his holy splendor.
131Ch 16:30 Tremble in his presence, all the earth! Surely the inhabited world stands firm - it cannot be moved.
131Ch 16:31 Let the heavens rejoice, and the earth be glad! Say to the nations, "The Lord reigns!"
131Ch 16:32 Let the sea roar along with everything that fills it! Let the fields exult, along with everything in them!
131Ch 16:33 Then let the trees in the forest sing out in praise, for the Lord is coming to judge the world.
131Ch 16:34 Give thanks to the Lord, because he is good and because his gracious love is eternal!
131Ch 16:35 Call out, "Save us, God, you who delivers us! Gather us and rescue us from the nations! We will thank your holy name and rejoice as we praise you!
131Ch 16:36 Praise the Lord God of Israel, who lives from eternity to eternity! Then all of the people shouted "Amen!" and praised the Lord.
131Ch 16:37 Later David left the presence of the ark of the covenant of the Lord so Asaph and his fellow Levites could serve the ark there continually each day, doing whatever was required. 
131Ch 16:38 Obed-edom and 68 of his relatives remained also, with Jeduthun's son Obed-edom and Hosah serving as trustees. 
131Ch 16:39 He left Zadok the priest and his relatives at the Tabernacle of the Lord at the high place in Gibeon, where they ministered in the Lord's presence, 
131Ch 16:40 sacrificing the regular burnt offerings regularly each morning and evening to the Lord on the altar dedicated to that purpose, doing everything written in the Law of the Lord, just as he had commanded Israel.39
131Ch 16:41 David also appointed Heman, Jeduthun, and others chosen by name to give thanks to the Lord, because "his gracious love is eternal." 
131Ch 16:42 They accompanied their songs of praise to God with trumpets, cymbals, and other musical instruments while Jeduthun's children served as trustees. 
131Ch 16:43 After this, everyone left for their own homes and David went home to bless his own household.1642
131Ch 17:1 After David had settled down to live in his palace, he spoke with the prophet Nathan. "Look, here I am living in this cedar palace, but the ark of the Lord's covenant remains surrounded by curtains!"
131Ch 17:2 "Do everything you have in mind," Nathan replied to David, "because God is with you."
131Ch 17:3 But later that same night, this message came to Nathan from God£º 
131Ch 17:4 "Go tell David, my servant, 'This is what the Lord says£º "'"You won't be building a temple for me to inhabit, will you?
131Ch 17:5 After all, I haven't lived in a temple from the day I brought out Israel until today. Instead, I've lived from tent to tent and from one place to another. 
131Ch 17:6 Wherever I've moved within all of Israel, did I ever ask even one judge of Israel whom I commanded to shepherd my people, 'Why haven't you built me a cedar temple?'
131Ch 17:7 "'"Now therefore this is what you are to tell my servant David£º 'This is what the Lord of the Heavenly Armies says£º 'I took you from the pasture myself - from tending sheep - to become commander-in-chief over my people Israel.
131Ch 17:8 "'"Furthermore, I have remained with you everywhere you have gone, annihilating all your enemies right in front of you. I will make your reputation great, like the reputation of the great ones who have lived on earth. 
131Ch 17:9 I will establish a homeland for my people Israel, planting them in a secure location where they will never be disturbed anymore. Wicked people will not oppress them as happened in the past, 
131Ch 17:10 during the time I had commanded judges to administer my people Israel. I'll also grant you deliverance from all your enemies."' "'I'm also announcing to you that the Lord also will build a dynasty for you. 
131Ch 17:11 It shall come about that when your life is complete and you go to join your ancestors, I will raise up your offspring after you, who is related to one of your sons, and I will fortify his kingdom. 
131Ch 17:12 He will build a temple dedicated to me, and I will make his throne last forever. 
131Ch 17:13 I will be a father to him and he will be a son to me. I will never remove my gracious love from him as I did from the one who preceded you. 
131Ch 17:14 I will confirm him in my temple and in my kingdom forever, and his throne will remain secure forever.'"'"
131Ch 17:15 Using precisely these words, Nathan communicated this complete oracle to David.
131Ch 17:16 Then King David went in, sat down in the presence of the Lord, and said£º "Who am I, Lord God, and what is my household, since you have brought me to this?
131Ch 17:17 Furthermore, this is a small thing to you, God, and yet you have spoken concerning your servant's household for a great while to come, and you have seen in me the fulfillment of man's purpose, Lord God.
131Ch 17:18 "What more can David say to you about how you are honoring your servant, and you surely know your servant. 
131Ch 17:19 Lord, for the sake of your servant, and consistent with your heart, you have done all of these great things and are now making these great things known.17
131Ch 17:20 "Lord, there is no one like you, and we have heard from no god other than you. 
131Ch 17:21 What other one nation on the earth is like your people Israel, God, which you have redeemed from slavery to become your own people, making a great name for yourself when you redeemed your people from Egypt. You did awesome miraculous deeds, driving out nations that stood in their way. 
131Ch 17:22 You took your people Israel to be your very own people forever, and you, Lord, have become their God.
131Ch 17:23 "And now, Lord, let what you have spoken concerning your servant and his household be done forever - and let it be done just as you've promised. 
131Ch 17:24 May your name be made great and honored forever£º The Lord of the Heavenly Armies, the God of Israel, is God for Israel, and may the family of David your servant stand before you forever.
131Ch 17:25 "Because of you, my God, I have been bold to pray to you, as you have told your servant that you will build him a dynasty. 
131Ch 17:26 And now, Lord, you are God, and you have promised all of these good things to your servant. 
131Ch 17:27 Furthermore, it has pleased you to bless the dynasty of your servant, so that it will continue in place forever in your presence, because when you, Lord, grant a blessing, it is an eternal blessing."
131Ch 18:1 After this, David defeated and subdued the Philistines, and then took possession of Gath and its towns from Philistine control. 
131Ch 18:2 He also conquered Moab, placing them in servitude and making them pay tribute.
131Ch 18:3 David also defeated King Hadadezer of Zobah, which is near Hamath, while he was going about establishing his hegemony as far as the Euphrates River. 
131Ch 18:4 David confiscated 1,000 chariots, 7,000 horsemen, and 20,000 foot soldiers from him, hamstrung all of the chariot horses except for a reserve force of 100 chariots. 
131Ch 18:5 When Arameans came from Damascus to help King Hadadezer of Zobah, David killed 22,000 of them. 
131Ch 18:6 David later erected garrisons in Aram of Damascus, and the Arameans were placed under servitude to David, to whom they paid tribute. 
131Ch 18:7 David also confiscated the gold shields that belonged to Hadadezer's officials and took them to Jerusalem. 
131Ch 18:8 David also confiscated a vast quantity of bronze from Tibhath and Cun, cities under Hadadezer's control. Later on, Solomon crafted the bronze sea, the pillars, and the bronze vessels for the temple.
131Ch 18:9 When King Tou of Hamath learned that David had conquered King Hadadezer of Zobah's entire army, 
131Ch 18:10 he sent his son Hadoram to King David to meet and congratulate him, because he had fought against and defeated Hadadezer. Since Hadadezer had often been to war against Tou, he sent all sorts of gold, silver, and bronze goods 
131Ch 18:11 to King David, which David also dedicated to the Lord, along with silver and gold that he confiscated from all the surrounding nations, including Edom, Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek.18
131Ch 18:12 Zeruiah's son Abishai killed 18,000 Edomites in the Salt Valley. 
131Ch 18:13 He erected garrisons in Edom, and all the Edomites became subservient to David, while the Lord gave victory to David wherever he went.
131Ch 18:14 So David reigned over all of Israel, administering justice and equity to all of his people. 
131Ch 18:15 Zeruiah's son Joab served in charge of the army, Ahilud's son Jehoshaphat was his personal archivist, 
131Ch 18:16 Ahitub's son Zadok and Abiathar's son Ahimelech were priests, Shavsha was his personal secretary, 
131Ch 18:17 Jehoiada's son Benaiah supervised the special forces and mercenaries, while David's sons worked as chief officials in service to the king.
131Ch 19:1 Some time later, King Nahash of Ammon died and his son succeeded him, 
131Ch 19:2 so David said to himself, "I will be loyal to Nahash's son Hanun, since his father showed loyal, gracious love to me." So David sent a delegation to console him about his loss of his father. But when David's delegation arrived to visit Hanun in Ammonite territory to console him, 
131Ch 19:3 the Ammonite officials asked Hanun, "Do you think that because David has sent a delegation of consolers to you that he is honoring your father?His delegation has arrived to search, overthrow, and scout the land, hasn't it?" 
131Ch 19:4 So Hanun arrested David's delegation, shaved off their beards, cut off their clothes at the waist line, and sent them away in disgrace.
131Ch 19:5 After they had departed, David was informed about the men, so he sent word to them, since they had been deeply humiliated. He told them, "Stay at Jericho until your beards have grown back, and then return."
131Ch 19:6 When the Ammonites realized that they had created quite a stink with David, Hanun and the Ammonites spent 1,000 silver talents to hire chariots and mercenaries from Mesopotamia, from Aram-maacah, and from Zobah. 
131Ch 19:7 They hired 32,000 chariots, along with the king of Maacah and his army, who arrived and encamped at Medeba. The Ammonites also were mustered and came out to battle from their home cities. 
131Ch 19:8 In response, David sent out Joab and his entire army of elite soldiers. 
131Ch 19:9 The Ammonites went out in battle formation in front of the entrance to the city while the kings who had come stayed by themselves in the open fields.
131Ch 19:10 When Joab observed that the battle lines were set up to oppose him both in front and behind, he appointed some special forces from Israel and arrayed them to oppose the Arameans, 
131Ch 19:11 putting the rest of his forces under command of his brother Abishai, who arrayed them to oppose the Ammonites. 
131Ch 19:12 He said to Abishai, "If the Arameans prove too strong for me, then you are to help me. If the Ammonites prove too strong for you, then I will help you. 
131Ch 19:13 Be strong, be courageous on behalf of our people and for the cities of our God, and may the Lord do what he thinks is best." 
131Ch 19:14 So Joab and the soldiers who were with him attacked the Arameans in battle formation, and the Arameans retreated in front of him. 
131Ch 19:15 When the Ammonites saw the Arameans retreating, they also retreated from Joab's brother Abishai back to the city and Joab left for Jerusalem. 
131Ch 19:16 After the Arameans realized that they had been defeated by Israel, they sent for the Arameans who lived beyond the Euphrates River. Shophach was leading them as commander of Hadadezer's army.
131Ch 19:17 When David learned this, he mustered all of Israel, crossed the Jordan, approached the Arameans, and drew up his forces against them. After David had assembled in battle array against the Arameans, the Arameans attacked him. 
131Ch 19:18 The Arameans retreated from Israel, and David's forces killed 7,000 Aramean charioteers, 40,000 soldiers, and Shophach, the commander of their army. 
131Ch 19:19 When Hadadezer's officials saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they sought terms of peace with David and became subservient to him. After this, the Arameans were unwilling to help the Ammonites any more.1917
131Ch 20:1 Later the next spring, at the time that kings go out to fight, Joab led out the army, ravaged the territory of the Ammonites, went out and attacked Rabbah, while David remained behind in Jerusalem. Joab besieged Rabbah and conquered it. 
131Ch 20:2 David confiscated the crown of their king from his head, and found that its weight was 75 pounds in gold. A precious stone had been set in it, and it was placed on David's head. He also confiscated a great amount of war booty that had been plundered from the city, 
131Ch 20:3 brought back the people who had lived in it and put them to conscripted labor with saws, iron picks, and axes. David did this to every Ammonite city, and then David and his entire army returned to Jerusalem.202
131Ch 20:4 Afterwards, war broke out against the Philistines at Gezer, where Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Sippai, one of the descendants of the Rephaim, defeating the Philistines. 
131Ch 20:5 There was also another battle against the Philistines, when Jair's son Elhanan killed Lahmi the Gittite, Goliath's brother, whose spear was as big as a weaver's beam. 
131Ch 20:6 There was also a battle at Gath, where there was a very tall man with six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot - for a total of 24 digits - who was a descendant of the Rephaim. 
131Ch 20:7 When he challenged Israel, Shimei's son Jonathan, David's nephew, killed him. 
131Ch 20:8 These descendants from the giants in Gath died at the hands of David and his servants.
131Ch 21:1 Then Satan attacked Israel by inciting David to enumerate a census of Israel. 
131Ch 21:2 David ordered Joab and the commanders of the army, "Go take a census of Israel from Beer-sheba to Dan, and bring me a report so I can be aware of the total number."1
131Ch 21:3 But Joab replied, "May the Lord increase the population of his people a hundredfold! Your majesty, all of them are your majesty's servants, aren't they?So why should your majesty demand this?Why should he bring guilt to Israel?"
131Ch 21:4 But the king's order overruled Joab, so Joab left, traveled throughout all of Israel, and then returned to Jerusalem 
131Ch 21:5 to report the total population count to David. Throughout all of Israel there were 1,100,000 men trained for war. In Judah there were 470,000 men trained for war. 
131Ch 21:6 Levi and Benjamin were not included in the census, because what the king had commanded was unethical to Joab.
131Ch 21:7 God considered this behavior to be evil, so he attacked Israel. 
131Ch 21:8 David responded to God, "I sinned greatly by behaving this way. But now I am asking you, please remove the guilt of your servant, since I have acted very foolishly."
131Ch 21:9 So the Lord responded through Gad, David's seer. 
131Ch 21:10 "Go and tell David, 'This is what the Lord says£º "I'm holding three choices out for you£º pick one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you."'"
131Ch 21:11 Gad went to David and told him, "This is what the Lord says£º 'Make a choice for yourself£º 
131Ch 21:12 Either three years of famine, or three months of reversals as you are swept away by your enemies while the sword of your enemies overtakes you, or three days with the sword of the Lord, consisting of pestilence infecting the land, with the angel of the Lord wreaking destruction from border to border throughout all of Israel.' Decide right now what I am to answer to the one who sent me."
131Ch 21:13 So David replied to Gad, "This is a very bad choice for me to make! Let me now please fall into the hand of the Lord, because his mercy is very great, but may I never fall into human hands!"
131Ch 21:14 Then the Lord sent a pestilence to Israel, and 70,000 men died in Israel. 
131Ch 21:15 God also sent an angel to destroy Jerusalem, but as he was about to do so, the Lord looked and withdrew the calamity by saying to the destroying angel, "Enough! Stop what you're doing!" So the angel of the Lord remained standing near the threshing floor that belonged to Ornan the Jebusite. 
131Ch 21:16 David looked up and saw the angel of the Lord standing between earth and heaven, with a drawn sword in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the elders, clothed in sackcloth, fell on their faces.
131Ch 21:17 David said to God, "Wasn't I the one who ordered the census of the population?Wasn't it I who sinned and acted wickedly?Now as for these sheep, what have they done?Lord God, please let your hand be against me and my ancestral household, but don't let your people be ravaged by plague!"
131Ch 21:18 The angel of the Lord told Gad to tell David that David was to go up and build an altar to the Lord on the threshing floor that belonged to Ornan the Jebusite. 
131Ch 21:19 So David went up, obeying Gad's directive that he had spoken in the name of the Lord. 
131Ch 21:20 Ornan turned around and saw the angel. While his four sons with him ran away to hide, Ornan continued to thresh wheat. 
131Ch 21:21 As David approached Ornan, Ornan looked around and observed David, left the threshing floor, and fell to the ground before David with his face on the ground.
131Ch 21:22 David said to Ornan, "Give me the threshing floor as a site to build an altar to the Lord on it. Give it to me at its full price, so the plague may be averted from the people."
131Ch 21:23 But Ornan replied to David, "Take it! Let your majesty the king do whatever seems like a good idea to him. Look here! I'm giving the oxen for burnt offerings, the threshing machinery for the wood, and the wheat for a grain offering. I'm giving all of it."
131Ch 21:24 But King David said to Ornan, "No. I will buy them for the full price because I will not offer to the Lord what is yours or offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing."
131Ch 21:25 So David paid Ornan 600 shekels weight worth in gold for the site, 
131Ch 21:26 built an altar to the Lord there, and presented burnt offerings and peace offerings. He called out to the Lord, and he answered him from heaven with fire on the altar of burnt offerings. 
131Ch 21:27 After this, the Lord spoke to the angel, who then sheathed his sword.22
131Ch 21:28 From that time on, after David had observed that the Lord had answered him at the threshing floor of Ornan the Jebusite, he made his sacrifices there. 
131Ch 21:29 Meanwhile, the tabernacle of the Lord that Moses had crafted in the desert, along with the altar of burnt offerings, were being stored at the high place in Gibeon at that time, 
131Ch 21:30 but David was not going before it to inquire of God, because he was afraid of the sword carried by the angel of the Lord. 
131Ch 22:1 Davidsaid,"ThisiswheretheLord God's temple will be, along with the altar of burnt offerings for Israel."
131Ch 22:2 David subsequently issued orders to conscript the resident aliens who lived in the land of Israel and appointed stonecutters to prepare stones for building a temple for God. 
131Ch 22:3 David also provisioned abundant supplies of iron for nails to build the doors for gates and to build clamps. Furthermore, he provided so much bronze it wasn't inventoried, 
131Ch 22:4 as well as an innumerable amount of cedar logs, since the Sidonians and Tyrians brought vast amounts of cedar to David.
131Ch 22:5 David thought, "My son Solomon is young and inexperienced. The temple that will be built for the Lord is to be magnificent, well known, and internationally honored, so I will complete preparations for it." So before his death, David finished providing a great quantity of materials for it.
131Ch 22:6 Later, David called for his son Solomon and directed him to build a temple to the Lord God of Israel. 
131Ch 22:7 David addressed Solomon£º "I have attempted to build a temple to the name of the Lord my God. 
131Ch 22:8 But the word of the Lord came to me, telling me 'You have shed a lot of blood and fought great battles. You won't be building a house for me name, since you have shed so much blood on the earth in my sight. 
131Ch 22:9 But look! A son born to you will live comfortably, because I will give him rest from all his enemies that surround him on every side, since his name will be "Solomon" - I will give peace and quiet for Israel during his lifetime. 
131Ch 22:10 He will build a temple to my name. He will be a son to me, I myself will be a father to him, and I will secure his royal throne in Israel forever.'
131Ch 22:11 So now, my son, may the Lord be with you, so that you are successful in constructing the temple of the Lord your God, just as he has spoken about you.
131Ch 22:12 "Only may the Lord give you discretion and understanding as he places you in charge over Israel, so you can keep the Law of the Lord your God. 
131Ch 22:13 Then you will be successful, if you keep on observing the statutes and ordinances that the Lord commanded Moses concerning Israel. Be strong, be courageous, and never give in to fear or dismay. 
131Ch 22:14 At great effort I have provided for the temple of the Lord 100,000 gold talents, 1,000,000 silver talents, as well as bronze and iron beyond calculation, since there is so much of it. I've also provided timber and stone, but you'll need to obtain more. 
131Ch 22:15 You already have plenty of workers, including stonecutters, masons, carpenters, and an innumerable group of artisans who are skilled at working in 
131Ch 22:16 gold, silver, bronze, and iron. So begin the work, and may the Lord be with you."2212
131Ch 22:17 David also issued these orders to all of the leaders of Israel to assist his son Solomon£º 
131Ch 22:18 "Isn't the Lord your God with you?Hasn't he surrounded you with comfort?He has delivered the inhabitants of the land into my control, and the land lies subdued both in the Lord's presence and before his people. 
131Ch 22:19 So set your minds and hearts to seek the Lord your God, to get up, and to build the sanctuary of the Lord God, so the ark of the covenant of the Lord and the holy vessels of God may be stored in a temple built for the name of the Lord."
131Ch 23:1 After David had reached old age, and had completed his reign, he set his son Solomon as king over Israel. 
131Ch 23:2 David then gathered together all of the leaders of Israel, including the priests and Levites. 
131Ch 23:3 Levites 30 years old and above were counted for a total of 38,000. "Twenty-four thousand of these," David said, "are to be set in charge of the work of the temple of the Lord, with 6,000 serving as officers and judges, 
131Ch 23:5 with 4,000 gatekeepers, and with 4,000 offering praises to the Lord with the musical instruments that I have had crafted."
131Ch 23:6 David divided them into divisions based on Gershon, Kohath, and Merari, Levi's sons.
131Ch 23:7 The descendants of Gershon - ?were Ladan and Shimei. 
131Ch 23:8 The three descendants of Ladan included Jehiel (their chief), Zetham, and Joel. 
131Ch 23:9 The three descendants of Shimei included Shelomoth, Haziel, and Haran. These were the heads of families of Ladan.
131Ch 23:10 The descendants of Shimei included Jahath, Zina, Jeush, and Beriah. These four were sons of Shimei. 
131Ch 23:11 Jahath served as chief and Zizah was second in rank, but since Jeush and Beriah did not have many sons, they were enrolled as a single family unit.
131Ch 23:12 The four descendants of Kohath included Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 
131Ch 23:13 The descendants of Amram included Aaron and Moses. Aaron had been set apart to consecrate the most holy things, with the intent that he and his sons should present offerings in the Lord's presence forever, ministering to him and pronouncing blessings in his name forever.
131Ch 23:14 Meanwhile, as for Moses the man of God, his sons were considered among the tribe of Levi. 
131Ch 23:15 The descendants of Moses included Gershom and Eliezer. 16The descendants of Gershom included Shebuel as their chief.15
131Ch 23:17 The descendants of Eliezer included Rehabiah as their chief. Eliezer had no other sons, but Rehabiah had many descendants.
131Ch 23:18 The descendants of Izhar included Shelomith their chief.
131Ch 23:19 The descendants of Hebron included Jeriah their chief, Amariah their second in rank, Jahaziel their third, and Jekameam their fourth.
131Ch 23:20 The descendants of Uzziel included Micah their chief and Isshiah their second in rank.
131Ch 23:21 The descendants of Merari included Mahli and Mushi. The descendants of Mahli included Eleazar and Kish, 
131Ch 23:22 but Eleazar died having no sons, but only daughters. Their relatives (the descendants of Kish) married them. 
131Ch 23:23 The three descendants of Mushi included Mahli, Eder, and Jeremoth.
131Ch 23:24 These were the descendants of Levi according to their ancestral households, with family heads documented according to the names of persons 20 years and older who were appointed to perform work in service to the temple of the Lord.
131Ch 23:25 For David had said "The Lord God of Israel has granted rest to his people, and he has taken Israel as his eternal residence. 
131Ch 23:26 Therefore the Levites are no longer to carry the Tabernacle or its service implements." 
131Ch 23:27 Since according to David's final instructions, the list above contains the total number of Levites from the age of 20 years and upward, 
131Ch 23:28 David issued these orders£º "Instead, they are to assist by lending a hand to the descendants of Aaron regarding service to the temple of the Lord relating to the courts, the chambers, purification of everything pertaining to holiness, and to anything else pertaining to service on behalf of the temple of God, 
131Ch 23:29 including assisting with the rows of showbread, select flour for the grain offerings, the unleavened bread, baked offerings, oil-based offerings, no matter what the quantity or sizes. 
131Ch 23:30 They are to take their stand morning by morning, thanking and praising the Lord right through until the evening, 
131Ch 23:31 whenever burnt offerings are presented to the Lord, whether on Sabbaths, new moons, or scheduled festivals, regularly in the Lord's presence in accordance with the number required to conduct their service. 
131Ch 23:32 By doing this, they will fulfill their obligation as trustees over the Tent of Assembly and the Sanctuary, attending to the needs of their relatives, who are descendants of Aaron, in keeping with their service on behalf of the temple of the Lord."
131Ch 24:1 With respect to the descendants of Aaron, classes of service were organized for Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar, the descendants of Aaron. 
131Ch 24:2 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father did, leaving no sons, so Eleazar and Ithamar became priests. 
131Ch 24:3 Along with Zadok, one of Eleazar's descendants, and Ahimelech, one of Ithamar's descendants, David organized their service according to their assigned responsibilities.
131Ch 24:4 More leaders were located among Eleazar's descendants than among those of Ithamar, so sixteen leaders were appointed from the leaders of the ancestral households of Eleazar's descendants and eight from those of Ithamar. 
131Ch 24:5 They were chosen by impartial lottery, since there were trustees of the sanctuary and officers of God among both Eleazar's descendants and among Ithamar's descendants. 
131Ch 24:6 Nethanel's son Shemaiah, a Levitical scribe, made an official record of them for the king, the officers, Zadok the priest, Abiathar's son Ahimelech, and the heads of ancestral households of both the priests and the Levites. One ancestral house was chosen for Eleazar and one for Ithamar.
131Ch 24:7 The first lottery was chosen in favor of Jehoiarib, the second for Jedaiah, 
131Ch 24:8  third for Harim, the fourth for Seorim, 
131Ch 24:9 the fifth for Malchijah, the sixth for Mijamin, 
131Ch 24:10 the seventh for Hakkoz, the eighth for Abijah,

131Ch 24:16 the nineteenth for Pethahiah, the twentieth for Jehezkel, 
131Ch 24:17 the twenty-first for Jachin, the twenty-second for Gamul, 
131Ch 24:18 the twenty-third for Delaiah, and the twenty-fourth for Maaziah. 
131Ch 24:19 These were appointed to enter the temple of the Lord according to their protocols established by their ancestor Aaron, as commanded by the Lord God of Israel.
131Ch 24:20 Now with respect to the descendants of Levi there remained Shubael from the descendants of Amram and Jehdeiah from the descendants of Shubael; 
131Ch 24:21 with respect to Rehabiah, Isshiah their chief from the descendants Rehabiah;

131Ch 24:29 with respect to Kish, Jerahmeel, one of the descendants of Kish; 
131Ch 24:30 and with respect to the descendants of Mushi, Mahli, Eder, and Jerimoth. These were the descendants of Levi according to their ancestral households. 
131Ch 24:31 These individuals also cast lots corresponding to their relatives, Aaron's descendants, in the presence of King David, Zadok, and Ahimelech, and in the presence of the heads of the ancestral households of the priests and of the Levites, and the eldest was treated as impartially as was the younger brother.2424
131Ch 25:1 Along with officers in his army, David consecrated to assist in service to the descendants of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun those who prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals. The list of those who participated in this service included£º

131Ch 25:6 They were all under their father's supervision regarding music in the temple of the Lord with cymbals, harps, and lyres for the service of the temple of God. Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman were under command of the king. 
131Ch 25:7 They and their relatives who had been skillfully trained in singing to the Lord, numbered 288.

131Ch 27:22 for Dan, there was Jeroham's son Azarel. These were the leaders of the tribes of Israel.
131Ch 27:23 David did not complete a census of those younger than 20 years of age, since the Lord had said he would make Israel as numerous as the stars of heaven. 
131Ch 27:24 Zeruiah's son Joab began the census, but never completed it. Nevertheless, God became angry with Israel because of this, so the number was never entered into the official records of the Annals of King David.
131Ch 27:25 Adiel's son Azmaveth was responsible for the king's treasuries. Uzziah's son Jonathan was in charge of treasuries located in the country, in cities, in villages, and in towers. 
131Ch 27:26 Chelub's son Ezri supervised the field workers who tilled the soil. 
131Ch 27:27 Shimei the Ramathite supervised the vineyards. In charge over the produce of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the Shiphmite.

131Ch 27:29 Shitrai the Sharonite supervised the herds that were pastured in Sharon. Adlai's son Shaphat supervised the herds in the valleys. 
131Ch 27:30 Obil the Ishmaelite supervised the camels. Jehdeiah the Meronothite supervised the donkeys. Jaziz the Hagrite supervised the flocks. 
131Ch 27:31 All of these served as stewards over King David's property.28
131Ch 27:32 David's uncle Jonathan was a counselor, since he was a man of understanding and a scribe, and Hachmoni's son Jehiel was an attendant to the king's sons. 
131Ch 27:33 Ahithophel served as an advisor to the king, Hushai the Archite was the king's trusted associate, 
131Ch 27:34 and under Ahithophel there was Benaiah's son Jehoiada and Abiathar. Joab served as commander of the king's army.2732
131Ch 28:1 David gathered together all of the leaders of Israel, the leaders of the tribes, division officers who reported to the king, the commanders of thousands, commanders of hundreds, the supervisors of the property and livestock that belonged to the king and to his sons, along with all of the officers of the palace, the elite forces, and all of the soldiers.
131Ch 28:2 King David rose to his feet and said, "My fellow citizens, may I have your attention. I intended to build a house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the Lord, for a footstool of our God, so I began preparations for its construction. 
131Ch 28:3 But then God told me, 'You will not build a temple to my name, because you are a man of war, and you have committed bloodshed.' 
131Ch 28:4 Nevertheless, the Lord God of Israel choose me from my entire ancestral household to be king over Israel forever, since he had chosen Judah as commander-in-chief. In my ancestor Judah's household, from my father's household, and from among my father's sons it pleased him to make me king over all of Israel.
131Ch 28:5 "Now out of all of my sons (since the Lord has given me many of them), he has selected my son Solomon to sit on the throne of the kingdom of the Lord, ruling over Israel. 
131Ch 28:6 He said to me, 'I chose your son Solomon to be the one who will construct my temple and my courts, because I have chosen him to be a son to me, and I will be a father to him. 
131Ch 28:7 I will establish his kingdom forever, assuming he remains strongly committed to carry out my commandments and ordinances, as he is doing today.'
131Ch 28:8 Therefore, in the presence of all of Israel, the assembly of the Lord, and while our God is listening, observe and search through all of the commandments of the Lord your God, so that you may continue to possess this good land, leaving it for an inheritance forever to benefit your descendants who come after you."
131Ch 28:9 "Now as for you, my son Solomon, get to know the God of your father. Serve him with a sound heart and a devoted soul, because the Lord is searching every heart, every plan and thought. He will be found by you, assuming you are seeking him, but if you abandon him, he will abandon you forever. 
131Ch 28:10 So keep watching, because the Lord has chosen you to build the temple of his sanctuary. So be strong, and get to work!"
131Ch 28:11 At this point in his address, David transferred to his son Solomon the construction plans for the Hall of Justice, its buildings, its treasure vaults, its upper rooms, its inner chambers, the housing for the Mercy Seat, 
131Ch 28:12 and the plans for everything else that he had in mind for the courtyards of the temple of the Lord. Included were plans for all of the surrounding vaults and treasuries of the temple of God intended for storage of dedicated gifts, 
131Ch 28:13 for use by the ranks of priests and Levites, for all the work of service responsibilities in the temple of the Lord, and for all of the utensils used in the work of the temple of the Lord. 
131Ch 28:14 David also transferred to him by weight the gold that was to be used to craft the service utensils, the silver that was to be used to craft the service utensils, 
131Ch 28:15 the gold for the golden lamp stands and their lamps, the silver for a lamp stand and its lamps (each according to its intended use in the service), 
131Ch 28:16 the gold by weight for each table of the rows of bread, the silver for the silver tables, 
131Ch 28:17 pure gold for the forks, the basins, the cups, the golden bowls (along with enough gold by weight for each one), enough weight for each of the silver bowls, 
131Ch 28:18 refined gold for the altar of incense, by weight, along with his plans for crafting the golden chariot for the cherubim that spread out their wings to cover the ark of the covenant of the Lord.2817
131Ch 28:19 "All of these things the Lord made clear to me in writing at his direction - the construction plans for all of the building."
131Ch 28:20 David continued with these words for his son Solomon£º "Be strong and courageous, and get to work. Never be afraid or discouraged, for the Lord God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you nor will he abandon you right up to your completion of the work for the service of the temple of the Lord. 
131Ch 28:21 Now look! Here are the ranks of the priests and the Levites for the entire service of the temple of God, and in all of the work there will be all types of volunteers who have skills for anything needed for the services. Furthermore, the officers and all of the people will be at your complete command."
131Ch 29:1 Then King David addressed the entire assembly£º "My son Solomon, the one whom God alone has chosen, is still young and inexperienced, and the task is great, since this structure will be a citadel to the Lord God and not for human beings. 
131Ch 29:2 To the extent that I have been able to do so, I have provided supplies for the temple of my God, including gold for what is to be made of gold, silver for what is to be made of silver, bronze for what is to be made of bronze, iron for what is to be made of iron, wood for what is to be made of wood, and great quantities of onyx, precious s tones, antimony, colored stones, all types of other semi-precious stones, and plenty of marble.
131Ch 29:3 "In addition to everything that I have supplied for the temple, it pleases me to provide my own treasure of gold and silver, so because of my love for the temple of my God I hereby give to the temple of my God the following£º 43,000 gold talents imported from Ophir, 7,000 talents of refined silver for gilding the walls of the temple 
131Ch 29:5 and for all the work to be undertaken by skilled artists, gold for what is to be made of gold, and silver for what is to be made of silver. Who then, will be dedicating the productivity of his own work to the Lord today?"
131Ch 29:6 So the leaders of the ancestral households presented their voluntary offerings, as did the leaders of the tribes, the commanders of thousands and hundreds, and the officials in charge of the king's business. 
131Ch 29:7 They presented 5,000 gold talents and 10,000 gold darics for the work of the temple of God, 10,000 silver talents, 18,000 bronze talents, and 100,000 iron talents. 
131Ch 29:8 Whoever owned precious stones gave them to the treasury of the temple of the Lord, in care of Jehiel the Gershonite. 
131Ch 29:9 Then the people rejoiced because they had given voluntarily, since with a devoted heart they had freely given to the Lord. King David also rejoiced greatly. 
131Ch 29:10 Then David blessed the Lord in the presence of the entire assembly. David said, How blessed you are, Lord, the God of our ancestor Israel, from eternity to eternity!
131Ch 29:11 To you, Lord, belongs the greatness, and the valor, and the splendor, and the endurance, and the majesty because all that is in heaven and on earth is yours. To you belongs the kingdom, Lord, and you are exalted as head over all.
131Ch 29:12 Both wealth and honor proceed from you, and you are ruling over them all. You control power - you control who is made great, and how everyone becomes strong.
131Ch 29:13 And so, our God, we are giving you thanks, and we are praising your wonderful name!
131Ch 29:14 But who am I, and who are my people, that we make such voluntary offerings as these?For all things come from you, and from your own hand we are giving to you.
131Ch 29:15 For we are aliens and vagrants in your presence, as were all of our ancestors. Our days on the earth pass away like shadows, and we have no hope.
131Ch 29:16 Lord our God, all of this abundance that we have given for building a temple for your great name was provided by you and all of it belongs to you.
131Ch 29:17 And I know, God, that it is you who searches the heart and you who finds pleasure in righteousness. With a righteous heart I have freely given all these things, and now I have seen all of these people of yours giving freely and joyfully to you!
131Ch 29:18 Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, our ancestors, keep your purposes and thoughts constantly in the hearts of your people and direct their hearts toward you,
131Ch 29:19 granting to my son Solomon to keep with a devoted heart your commands, your decrees, and your statutes, carrying out all of them, and that he may build the temple for which I have made the preparations.
131Ch 29:20 Then David said to the entire assembly, "Bless the Lord your God, please." So the entire assembly blessed the Lord God of their ancestors, bowing their heads and falling in the Lord's presence and before the king. 
131Ch 29:21 The next day, they offered sacrifices and burnt offerings to the Lord amounting to 1,000 bulls, 1,000 rams, and 1,000 lambs, along with their libations. Sacrifices were abundant throughout all Israel, 
131Ch 29:22 and they ate and drank in the Lord's presence with great joy. They crowned David's son Solomon king a second time and anointed him to serve as Commander-in-Chief to the Lord and Zadok to serve as priest. 
131Ch 29:23 So Solomon sat on the throne of the Lord as king in the place of his father David. He prospered, and all of Israel obeyed him. 
131Ch 29:24 All of the officials, all of the valiant soldiers, and all of King David's sons submitted to King Solomon's control, 
131Ch 29:25 and the Lord exalted Solomon magnificently in the sight of all Israel, bestowing upon him royal majesty such as had not been given to any king in Israel before him.
131Ch 29:26 Jesse's son David reigned as king over all of Israel, 
131Ch 29:27 serving as king over Israel for 40 years. He reigned for seven years in Hebron and for 33 in Jerusalem. 
131Ch 29:28 He died at a good old age, having lived a full life, replete with riches and honor, and with his son Solomon reigning in his place. 
131Ch 29:29 The activities of David the king are recorded in the History of Samuel the Seer, in the History of Nathan the Prophet, and in the History of Gad the Seer, 
131Ch 29:30 including details regarding his reign, his power, the circumstances that attended his life, Israel, and all of the kingdoms of the countries that surrounded him.
14
142Ch 1:1 As David's son Solomon consolidated his administration, the Lord his God was with him to make him very successful. 
142Ch 1:2 Solomon addressed the entire nation of Israel, including the commanders of thousands and hundreds, the judges, all the other leaders of Israel, and all of the heads of the ancestral houses of Israel.
142Ch 1:3 Solomon, along with the whole assembly with him, met at the high place in Gibeon because that's where God's Tent of Meeting that the Lord's servant Moses had constructed in the wilderness was located. 
142Ch 1:4 Nevertheless, David had brought the ark of God from Kiriath-jearim to the place that David had prepared for it, after having erected a tent for it in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 1:5 Also, the bronze altar that Uri's son Bezalel, Hur's grandson had erected, was in place in front of the Lord's tabernacle. Solomon and the assembly sought the Lord there. 
142Ch 1:6 Solomon approached the presence of the Lord at the bronze altar that had been placed at the Tent of Meeting and offered 1,000 burnt offerings on it.
142Ch 1:7 That very night God appeared to Solomon and said to him, "Ask what I am to give you."
142Ch 1:8 Solomon replied to God, "You showed great gracious love to my father David, and have established me as king in his place. 
142Ch 1:9 Now, Lord God, your promise to my father David is fulfilled, because you have made me king over a people as numerous as the dust of the earth. 
142Ch 1:10 Give me wisdom now, so I may go in and out among this people, because who can rule this great people that belongs to you - 
142Ch 1:11 God said to Solomon, "Since you had this in mind, to ask neither to focus on riches, wealth, honor, or the lives of those who hate you, nor have you requested a long life, but instead you have asked for wisdom and knowledge for yourself, so that you may rule my people over whom I have established you as king, 
142Ch 1:12 wisdom and knowledge have been granted to you. Furthermore, I will give you riches, wealth, and honor - such as none of the kings owned who lived before you and none after you are to ever attain their equal."1
142Ch 1:13 So Solomon returned from Tent of Meeting at the high place in Gibeon to Jerusalem, where he reigned over Israel. 
142Ch 1:14 Solomon amassed both chariots and horsemen£º he owned 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, stationing them in armories and with the king in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 1:15 The king made silver and gold as common in Jerusalem as stones, and made cedar trees as plentiful as sycamore trees that grow in the Shephelah. 
142Ch 1:16 Solomon's horses were imported from Egypt and from Kue; the king's procurement officials obtained them from Kue at great price. 
142Ch 1:17 Chariots were imported from Egypt for 600 shekels each, and horses cost 150 shekels each, and then they exported them to all of the kings of the Hittites and to the kings of Aram.1
142Ch 2:1 Now Solomon was determined to build a temple dedicated to the Name of the Lord as well as his own royal palace. 
142Ch 2:2 So Solomon conscripted 70,000 men to do heavy work, 80,000 men to quarry in the hill country, and 3,600 to supervise them. 
142Ch 2:3 Solomon also sent this message to King Hiram of Tyre£º "Just as you did with my father David, sending him cedars to build him a palace to live in, do the same for me. 
142Ch 2:4 Look, I'm building a temple dedicated to the name of the Lord my God, to his glory, so we can burn fragrant incense in his presence, display rows of the bread of his presence continually, make burnt offerings in the morning, evening, on Sabbath days, during new moon festivals, and during appointed feasts scheduled by the Lord our God. This is mandated forever in Israel.
142Ch 2:5 "The temple that I'm building will be great, because the greatness of our God surpasses that of all gods. 
142Ch 2:6 But who can build a temple for him, since neither heaven nor the highest of the heavens can contain him?So who am I, that I should built a temple to him, except to burn incense in his presence - 
142Ch 2:7 "At any rate, send me an individual who is a skilled craftsman in gold, silver, bronze, and iron, as well as in purple, crimson, and blue materials, who knows how to craft engravings, so he may work with the craftsmen whom I have assembled in Judah and Jerusalem, as provided for by my father David. 
142Ch 2:8 Also send me cedar, cypress, and algum timber from Lebanon, since I'm aware that your servants know how to cut down timber from Lebanon. My servants will accompany your servants 
142Ch 2:9 to prepare an abundant amount of timber for me, because the temple that I'm building is great and awesome.
142Ch 2:10 "Now look! I will pay your servants, the lumberjacks who prepare the timber, 20,000 measures of barley, 20,000 baths of wine, and 20,000 baths of oil."
142Ch 2:11 In a letter that he sent to Solomon, King Hiram of Tyre wrote, "Because he loves his people, the Lord has placed you as king over them." 
142Ch 2:12 Hiram also wrote£º "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who made the heavens and the earth. He gave King David a wise son, who is acquainted with discretion and understanding, and who is building a temple to the Lord, as well as a royal palace for himself.
142Ch 2:13 Now I'm sending along Hiram-abi, a skilled craftsman, who is very creative. 
142Ch 2:14 He is the son of a mother from the tribe of Dan, and his father is from Tyre. He's skilled in working with gold, silver, bronze, iron, stone, and timber, as well as in purple, blue, linen, and crimson materials. He is skilled in engravings, and can craft any design to which he may be assigned. He will work with your skilled artisans and with all of your craftsmen who have been assigned by my lord David, your father.2
142Ch 2:15 "So then, may my lord send to his servants the wheat, barley, oil, and wine about which he has spoken. 
142Ch 2:16 We'll cut down the timber you need from Lebanon and transport it to you on rafts by sea to Joppa, so you can move it to Jerusalem."
142Ch 2:17 Solomon took a census of all the non-Israelite men who lived in the land of Israel, after the census that his father David had taken, and 153,600 were counted. 
142Ch 2:18 He conscripted 70,000 of them to do heavy work, 80,000 to quarry in the hill country, and 3,600 men to supervise the people.2
142Ch 3:1 So Solomon began construction of the Lord's temple in Jerusalem on Mount Moriah where the Lord had appeared to his father David, that is, where David had prepared Ornan the Jebusite's threshing floor. 
142Ch 3:2 He began construction on the second day of the second month of the fourth year of his reign.
142Ch 3:3 These are the foundations that Solomon set in place for God's temple. The length in terms of the former standard measurements£º 90 feet; its width£º 30 feet. 
142Ch 3:4 A portico extended in front of the temple for its entire width of 30 feet, and was 180 feet high. Inside he had it overlaid with pure gold. 
142Ch 3:5 The main room of the temple was trimmed with a wainscoting composed of cypress wood, overlaid with fine gold ornamented with palm trees and chains. 
142Ch 3:6 The temple was adorned with precious stones, including gold from the Orient. 
142Ch 3:7 The temple was overlaid with gold, including the beams, thresholds, walls, and doors. Cherubim were engraved on the walls. 
142Ch 3:8 With respect to the Most Holy Place in the temple, its length across the width of the temple was 30 feet, and its width extended 30 feet. Solomon overlaid it with 45,000 pounds of pure gold. 
142Ch 3:9 The gold nails weighed 50 shekels. He also overlaid the upper rooms with gold. 
142Ch 3:10 He crafted two cherubim from wood, overlaid them with gold, and placed them in the Most Holy Place in the temple. 
142Ch 3:11 The wingspan of the cherubim was 30 feet; the wing of one, seven and a half feet long, touched the wall of the temple, and its other wing, seven and a half feet long, touched the wing of the other cherub. 
142Ch 3:12 The wing of the other cherub, seven and a half feet long, touched the opposite wall of the temple and its other wing, seven and a half feet long, touched the wing of the first cherub. 
142Ch 3:13 The wings of these cherubim extended for 30 feet as they stood on their feet and faced the front of the temple. 
142Ch 3:14 He constructed the veil from blue, purple, crimson, and fine linen, embroidering cherubim on it. 
142Ch 3:15 He also made two pillars 52 and a half feet high for the front of the temple, topped by a capital that was seven and a half feet high. 
142Ch 3:16 He crafted chains for the inner sanctuary and placed them on top of the pillars, attaching 100 pomegranates to each of the chains. 
142Ch 3:17 He set up the pillars at the front of the temple, one on the south side of the entrance and the other on the north side of the entrance. He named the south pillar Jachin and the north pillar Boaz.313
142Ch 4:1 Solomon also constructed a bronze altar 30 feet long, 30 feet wide, and 15 feet high. 
142Ch 4:2 He crafted a circular sea of cast metal 15 feet from rim to rim and seven-and-a-half feet tall. A line 45 feet long surrounded it. 
142Ch 4:3 Underneath, figurines resembling oxen encircled the circular sea beneath it, ten oxen every one and a half feet and encircling the sea completely. The oxen were in two rows, cast all at the same time. 
142Ch 4:4 The sea stood on top of twelve oxen, three of which faced to the north, three of which faced to the west, three of which faced to the south, and three of which faced toward the east. The sea was placed on top of the oxen, with all of their hindquarters turned inwards. 
142Ch 4:5 It was three inches thick, with its brim fashioned like the brim of a cup. Similar in shape to a lily blossom, it could hold 18,000 gallons. 
142Ch 4:6 Solomon also made ten wash basins, placing five on the right side and five on the left. The basins were intended for use to rinse burnt offerings, and the sea was intended for use by the priests to wash in.
142Ch 4:7 Solomon made ten gold lamp stands as he had been directed and set them in the temple, five on the south side and five on the north side. 
142Ch 4:8 He also made ten tables and placed them in the temple, five on the right side and five on the left side. He also constructed 100 gold basins. 
142Ch 4:9 He made the court of the priests, the great court, and doors for the court, overlaying their doors with bronze. 
142Ch 4:10 He set the sea at the southeast corner of the temple.7
142Ch 4:11 Hiram-abi crafted the pots, shovels, and basins, thus completing the work that he did for King Solomon on the temple of God; 
142Ch 4:12 that is, the two pillars, the bowls, the two capitals on top of the pillars, the two latticeworks that covered the two bowls for the capitals that were on top of the pillars; 
142Ch 4:13 the 400 pomegranate-shaped ornaments for the latticework of the two pillars (each latticework having two rows of ornaments at the bowl-shaped top of each pillar); 
142Ch 4:14 the ten stands with their ten basins; 
142Ch 4:15 the large bronze basin called the Sea with the twelve oxen underneath, 
142Ch 4:16 along with its pots, shovels, forks, and all of its other implements that Hiram-abi made from polished bronze for King Solomon and the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 4:17 The king had them forged in the clay ground between Succoth and Zeredah in the Jordan plain. 
142Ch 4:18 Solomon made so many utensils in such great quantities that the weight of the bronze was never fully recorded.
142Ch 4:19 Solomon also made these items for God's temple£º the golden altar, the tables for the Bread of the Presence, 
142Ch 4:20 the lamp stands and their lamps made of pure gold to burn in front of the inner sanctuary, as required, 
142Ch 4:21 the pure gold ornaments in the shape of flowers, the lamps, and the tongs (all made of the purest gold), 
142Ch 4:22 the gold trimming instruments, basins, pans, censers, and the gold door sockets for the inner sanctuary (that is, the most holy place), and for the doors to the main hall of the temple.421
142Ch 5:1 As soon as Solomon had completed the Lord's temple, he installed the holy items that had belonged to his father David, including the silver, gold, and all the other items) in the treasure rooms of God's temple. 
142Ch 5:2 Then Solomon called Israel's elders together, including all the leaders of the tribes and families of Israel. They met in Jerusalem to transfer the ark of the covenant of the Lord from Zion, the city of David. 
142Ch 5:3 All the men of Israel assembled in front of the king during the Feast of Tabernacles that takes place in the seventh month of the year.
142Ch 5:4 As soon all of Israel's elders had arrived, the Levites lifted the ark 
142Ch 5:5 and carried it, the tent where God met with his people, and all of the sacred implements that belonged in the tent. The Levitical priests carried these up to the city of David. 
142Ch 5:6 King Solomon and all the Israelites who had assembled together proceeded ahead of the ark and sacrificed more sheep and oxen than could be counted or recorded due to the number of sacrifices.
142Ch 5:7 The priests transported the ark of the covenant of the Lord to the place created for it within the inner sanctuary of the temple, into the most holy place under the wings of the cherubim. 
142Ch 5:8 The wings of the cherubim extended over where the ark and its carrying poles had been placed, 
142Ch 5:9 but the poles were long enough for their ends to extend to the front of the inner sanctuary, even though they could not be seen from outside. They remain there to this day. 
142Ch 5:10 There was nothing in the ark except for the two tablets that Moses had placed there while Israel was encamped at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the Israelites after he had brought them out of the land of Egypt.
142Ch 5:11 After this, the priests vacated the holy place. (Meanwhile, all the priests who were participating consecrated themselves, irrespective of their Levitical divisions. 
142Ch 5:12 All the Levite musicians, including Asaph, Heman, Jeduthun, and their sons and relatives wore linen and played cymbals and stringed instruments as they stood east of the altar. Accompanied by 120 priests who played trumpets, 
142Ch 5:13 the trumpeters and musicians played in union, praising and giving thanks to the Lord. They praised the Lord loudly and sang, "He is good, and his gracious love is eternal," accompanied by the trumpets, cymbals, and other musical instruments.) As they did this, a cloud filled the temple, that is, the Lord's temple, 
142Ch 5:14 and the priests were unable to complete their duties because of the cloud, since the glory of the Lord had filled God's temple.
142Ch 6:1 Then Solomon said, "The Lord has said that he lives shrouded in darkness. 
142Ch 6:2 Now I have constructed a magnificent temple dedicated to you that will serve as a place for you to inhabit forever."
142Ch 6:3 Then the king turned to face the entire congregation of Israel while the congregation of Israel remained standing. 
142Ch 6:4 Then Solomon prayed£º "Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, who made a commitment to my father David and then personally fulfilled what he had promised when he said:
142Ch 6:5 'From the day I brought out my people from the land of Egypt I never chose a city from all the tribes of Israel to build a temple where my name might reside. And I never chose any man to become commander-in-chief over my people Israel. 
142Ch 6:6 But I have chosen Jerusalem, where my name will reside. And I have chosen David to be over my people Israel.'
142Ch 6:7 "My father David wanted to build a temple for the name of the Lord God of Israel. 
142Ch 6:8 The Lord said to my father David£º 'Therefore, since you determined to build a temple for my name, you acted well, because it was your choice to do so. 
142Ch 6:9 Nevertheless, you are not to build the temple, but your son who will be born to you are to build a temple for my name.'
142Ch 6:10 "The Lord has brought to fulfillment what he promised, and now here I stand, having succeeded my father David to sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised. I have built the temple for the name of the Lord God of Israel. 
142Ch 6:11 I have placed in it the ark in which the covenant is stored that the Lord made with the Israelites."
142Ch 6:12 Then Solomon took his place in front of the Lord's altar in the presence of the entire congregation of Israel and spread out his hands. 
142Ch 6:13 Solomon had a bronze platform constructed seven and a half feet square and four and a half feet high. He had it erected in the middle of the courtyard, and stood on it. Then he knelt down on his knees in front of the entire congregation of Israel, spread out his hands toward heaven, 
142Ch 6:14 and said£º "Lord God of Israel, there is no one like you, God of heaven and earth, who watches over his covenant, showing gracious love to your servants who live their lives in your presence with all their hearts. 
142Ch 6:15 It is you, Lord God, who has kept your promise to my father, your servant David, that you made to him. Indeed, you made a commitment to my father David and then personally fulfilled what you had promised today.
142Ch 6:16 "Now therefore, Lord God of Israel, keep your promise that you made to my father, your servant David, when you said, 'You are to not lack a man to sit on the throne of Israel, if only your descendants will watch their lives, to live according to my Law, just as you have lived in my presence.'
142Ch 6:17 "Now therefore, Lord God of Israel, may your promise that you made to your servant David be fulfilled¡¦ 
142Ch 6:18 and yet, will God truly reside on earth with human beings?Look! Neither the sky nor the highest heaven can contain you! How much less this temple that I have built! 
142Ch 6:19 Pay attention to the prayer of your servant and to his request, Lord my God, and listen to the cry and prayer that your servant is praying in your presence. 
142Ch 6:20 Let your eyes always look toward this temple day and night, toward the location where you have said you would place your name. Listen to the prayer that your servant prays in this direction. 
142Ch 6:21 Listen to the requests from your servant and from your people Israel as they pray in this direction, and listen from the place where you reside - from heaven! - then hear and forgive.
142Ch 6:22 "If a man sins against his neighbor and he is required to take an oath, and he then comes to take an oath in front of your altar in this temple, 
142Ch 6:23 then listen from heaven, act, and judge your servants, recompensing the wicked by bringing back to him the consequences of his choices and by justifying the righteous by recompensing him according to his righteousness.
142Ch 6:24 "If your people Israel are defeated in a battle with their enemy because they have sinned against you, when they return to you and confess to you, pray, and in this temple they ask you to show grace to them, 
142Ch 6:25 then hear from heaven, forgive the sin of your people Israel, and return them to the soil that you gave to them and to their ancestors.
142Ch 6:26 "When the skies remain closed, and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, and they pray in the direction of this place, confessing your name and turning from their sin when you afflict them, 
142Ch 6:27 then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants and of your people Israel. Indeed, teach them the best way to live and send rain on your land that you have given to your people as an inheritance.26
142Ch 6:28 "If a famine comes to the land, or if there comes plant diseases, mildew, locust, or grasshoppers, or if their enemies attack them in their settlements of the land, no matter what the epidemic or illness is, 
142Ch 6:29 whatever prayer or request is made, no matter whether it's made by a single man or by all of your people Israel, each praying out of his own illness and anguish and stretching out their hands toward this temple, 
142Ch 6:30 then hear from heaven, the place where you reside, and forgive, repaying each person according to all of his ways, since you know their hearts - for you alone know the hearts of human beings?
142Ch 6:31 so they will fear you and live life your way as long as they live in the land that you have given to our ancestors.
142Ch 6:32 "Now concerning the foreigner who is not from your people Israel, when he comes from a land far away for the sake of your great name, your mighty acts, and your obvious power, when they come and pray in the direction of this temple, 
142Ch 6:33 then hear from heaven where you reside, and do whatever the foreigner asks of you, so that all the people of the earth may know your name, fear you as do your people Israel, and so they may know that this temple that I have built is called by your name.
142Ch 6:34 "When your people go out to war against their enemies, no matter what way you send them, and they pray to you in the direction of this city that you have chosen and in the direction of the temple that I have built for your name, 
142Ch 6:35 then hear their prayer and their request from heaven, and fight for their cause.
142Ch 6:36 "When they sin against you - because there isn't a single human being who doesn't sin - and you become angry with them and deliver them over to their enemy, who takes them away captive to a land that's near or far away, 
142Ch 6:37 if they turn their hearts back to you in the land where they have been taken captive, repent, and pray to you - even if they do so in the land where they have been taken captive - confessing, 'We have sinned, we have committed abominations, and practiced wickedness,' 
142Ch 6:38 if they return to you with all of their heart and with all of their soul in the land where they have been taken captive, as they pray in the direction of their land that you have given to their ancestors and to the city that you have chosen, and to the temple that I have built for your name, 
142Ch 6:39 then hear their prayer and requests from heaven, where you reside, and fight for their cause, forgiving your people who have sinned against you.
142Ch 6:40 "And now, my God, please let your eyes be open and your ears attentive to the prayers that are uttered in this place.6
142Ch 6:41 "And now may the Lord God arise, to your place of rest, you, and the ark of your power! Let your priests, Lord God, be clothed with salvation, and cause your godly ones to find their joy in what is good.6
142Ch 6:42 "Lord God, do not turn your face away from your anointed one. Remember your gracious love to your servant David."
142Ch 7:1 As soon as Solomon finished his prayer, fire descended from heaven and burned up the burnt offerings and sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord filled the temple. 
142Ch 7:2 The priests could not enter into the temple because the glory of the Lord had filled the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 7:3 When all of the Israelites saw the fire coming down and the glory of the Lord resting on the temple, they bowed down with their faces to the ground on the pavement, worshipped, and gave thanks to the Lord,       "Because he is good; because his gracious love is eternal."
142Ch 7:4 Then the king and all the people kept on offering sacrifices in the presence of the Lord. 
142Ch 7:5 King Solomon offered a sacrifice of 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep, which is how the king and all of the people dedicated God's temple. 
142Ch 7:6 The priests stood in waiting at their assigned placed, along with the Levites who carried musical instruments used in service to the Lord that King David had made for giving thanks to the Lord - because his gracious love is eternal - whenever David, accompanied by priests sounding trumpets, offered praises while all of Israel stood in the assembly.
142Ch 7:7 Solomon also dedicated the middle of the court in front of the Lord's temple by offering there burnt offerings and fat from peace offerings because the bronze altar that Solomon had made could not contain the burnt offerings, grain offerings, and fat portion offerings. 
142Ch 7:8 At that time Solomon also held a week-long festival attended by all of Israel. The assembly was very large, and included people from as far away as Lebo-hamath to the Wadi of Egypt. 
142Ch 7:9 On the day after the festival ended, they convened a solemn assembly, because they had been dedicating the altar for seven days and observing the feast for seven days. 
142Ch 7:10 On the twenty-third day of the seventh month, King Solomon sent the people back home, and they returned rejoicing and in good spirits because of the goodness that the Lord had shown to David, to Solomon, and to his people Israel. 
142Ch 7:11 And so Solomon completed the Lord's temple, bringing to completion everything that he had planned on doing for the Lord's temple and for his own palace.
142Ch 7:12 Later, the Lord appeared to Solomon during the night and told him£º "I have heard your prayer and have chosen this place for a sacrificial temple to me. 
142Ch 7:13 Whenever I close the skies so there is no rain, or whenever I command locusts to lay waste to the land, or whenever I send epidemics among my people, 
142Ch 7:14 when my people humble themselves - the ones who are called by my name - and pray, seek me, and turn away from their evil practices, I myself will listen from heaven, I will pardon their sins, and I will restore their land.
142Ch 7:15 "Now therefore my eyes will remain open and my ears will remain listening to the prayers that are offered in this place. 
142Ch 7:16 Furthermore, I have chosen and have set apart for myself this temple, intending my name to reside there forever. My eyes and my heart will reside there everyday. 
142Ch 7:17 Now as for you, if you commune with me like your father did, doing everything that I have commanded you, including obeying my statutes and my legal decisions, 
142Ch 7:18 then I will make your royal throne secure, just as I agreed to do for your father David when I said, 'You are to not lack a man to rule over Israel.'717
142Ch 7:19 "But if you turn away and abandon my statutes and my commands that I have given you, and if you walk away to serve other gods and worship them, 
142Ch 7:20 then I will tear them up by the roots from the ground that I had given them! And as for this temple that I have set apart for my name, I will throw it out of my sight and make it the butt of jokes and a means of ridicule among people worldwide!
142Ch 7:21 "Furthermore, even though this temple seems so exalted, everyone who passes by it will so astounded that they will ask, 'Why did the Lord do this to this land and to this temple?' 
142Ch 7:22 They will answer, 'Because they abandoned the Lord God of their ancestors, who brought them from the land of Egypt, adopted other gods, worshiped them, and served them, therefore the Lord has brought all of this disaster on them.'"
142Ch 8:1 It took Solomon 20 years to build the Lord's temple and his own palace. 
142Ch 8:2 During this time, he also rebuilt the towns that Hiram had restored to him, and he settled Israelites in them. 
142Ch 8:3 After this, Solomon traveled to Hamath-zobah and captured it. 
142Ch 8:4 Then he rebuilt Tadmor in the desert, along with supply centers that he had built in Hamath. 
142Ch 8:5 He also built upper and lower Beth-horon as fortified cities, installing walls, gates, and bars, 
142Ch 8:6 and he rebuilt Baalath and its supply centers that belonged to Solomon, along with all the cities that he utilized to garrison his chariots and cavalry forces. Solomon was pleased also to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in every territory that he controlled.
142Ch 8:7 All of survivors who remained living in the land but who were not Israelites (including Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites), 
142Ch 8:8 were descendants of the nations whom the people of Israel had not eliminated. Solomon put them to work as conscripted laborers, which they continue to do to this day. 
142Ch 8:9 However, Solomon never made conscripted laborers from among the Israelites, but they did serve as his army, as his chief captains, and as commanders in charge of his chariots and cavalry. 
142Ch 8:10 King Solomon appointed 250 chief officers to command his army. 
142Ch 8:11 Later, Solomon moved Pharaoh's daughter from the City of David to the palace that he had constructed to house her, because he reasoned, "My wife isn't going to live in the palace where King David of Israel lived, because wherever the ark of the Lord entered is holy."9
142Ch 8:12 Solomon offered burnt offerings to the Lord on the Lord's altar that he had built in front of the porch of the temple, 
142Ch 8:13 acting in compliance with the daily rule by offering them in conformity to commands issued by Moses for the Sabbaths, the new moons, the three annual feasts (the Feast of Unleavened Bread, the Feast of Weeks, and the Feast of Booths). 
142Ch 8:14 Following proscriptions laid down by his father David, Solomon appointed divisions of priests for their service as well as Levites for duties of praise and ministry before the priests consistent with the daily rules. Furthermore, because David, the man of God, had commanded it, Solomon also appointed gatekeepers to serve by divisions at every gate of the temple. 
142Ch 8:15 They scrupulously adhered to the orders issued by the king to the priests and Levites in everything, including matters pertaining to operation of the treasuries.
142Ch 8:16 And so Solomon completed all of the work, from the day that the foundation stone of the Lord's temple was laid until the Lord's temple was completely finished. 
142Ch 8:17 After this, Solomon visited Ezion-geber and Elath at the seashore in the land of Edom. 
142Ch 8:18 Hiram sent Solomon ships and servants who were expert mariners, and they sailed with Solomon's servants to Ophir, where they brought back 33,750 pounds of gold for Solomon.8
142Ch 9:1 When the queen of Sheba heard about Solomon's reputation, she traveled to Jerusalem and tested him with difficult questions. She brought along a large retinue, camels laden with spices, and lots of gold and precious stones. Upon her arrival, she spoke with Solomon about everything that was on her mind. 
142Ch 9:2 Solomon answered all of her questions. Because nothing was hidden from Solomon, he hid nothing from her. 
142Ch 9:3 When the queen of Sheba had seen Solomon's wisdom for herself, the palace that he had built, 
142Ch 9:4 the food set at his table, his servants who waited on him, his ministers in attendance and how they were dressed, his personal staff and how they were dressed, and even his personal stairway by which he went up to the Lord's temple, she was breathless!
142Ch 9:5 "Everything I heard about your wisdom and what you have to say is true!" she gasped, 
142Ch 9:6 "but I didn't believe it at first! But then I came here and I've seen it for myself! It's amazing! I wasn't told half of what's really great about your wisdom. You're far better in person than what the reports have said about you! 
142Ch 9:7 How blessed are your staff! And how blessed are your employees who serve you continuously and get to listen to your wisdom! 
142Ch 9:8 Blessed be the Lord your God, who is delighted with you! He set you in place on his throne to be king for the Lord your God. He made you king over them so you could carry out justice and implement righteousness, because your God loves Israel and intends to establish them forever."
142Ch 9:9 Then she gave the king 9,000 pounds of gold, a vast quantity of spices, and precious stones. There were no spices comparable to those that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. 
142Ch 9:10 Hiram's servants and Solomon's servants, who brought gold from Ophir, also presented algum wood and other precious stones. 
142Ch 9:11 The king used the algum wood to have steps made for the Lord's temple and for the royal palace, as well as lyres and harps for the choir, and nothing like that wood had been seen before in the territory of Judah. 
142Ch 9:12 In return, King Solomon gave the queen of Sheba everything she wanted and requested in addition to what she had brought for the king. Afterward, she turned to her own land with her servants.
142Ch 9:13 Solomon received in any given year about 49,950 pounds of gold, 
142Ch 9:14 not including revenue from traders and merchants. In addition, all the kings of Arabia and the governors of the nation brought gold and silver to Solomon. 
142Ch 9:15 King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold, overlaying each shield with the gold from 600 gold pieces, 
142Ch 9:16 and 300 shields from beaten gold, overlaying each shield with the gold from 300 gold pieces. The king put them in his palace in the Lebanon forest. 
142Ch 9:17 The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with pure gold. 
142Ch 9:18 Six steps led up to the throne. A golden footstool was attached to the throne, which had armrests on each side of the seat and two lions standing on either side of each armrest. 
142Ch 9:19 Twelve lions were placed on both sides of the six steps leading to the throne, and nothing comparable was made for any other kingdom. 
142Ch 9:20 All of King Solomon's drinking vessels were made of gold, and all the vessels in his palace in the Lebanon forest were made of pure gold. Silver was never considered to be valuable during the lifetime of Solomon, 
142Ch 9:21 because the king had ships that sailed to Tarshish accompanied by Hiram's servants. Once every three years ships from Tarshish returned, bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks.16
142Ch 9:22 As a result, King Solomon became greater than all the kings of the earth in regards to wealth and wisdom. 
142Ch 9:23 All the kings of the earth continued to seek audiences with Solomon so they could hear the wise things that God had put in his heart. 
142Ch 9:24 Everyone kept on bringing gifts on an annual basis, including items made of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules. 
142Ch 9:25 Solomon had 4,000 stalls for horses and chariots, along with 12,000 cavalry soldiers. He stationed them in various chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 9:26 King Solomon ruled over all the kings from the Euphrates River west to the land of the Philistines and as far south as the boundary with Egypt.
142Ch 9:27 The king made silver as common as stones in Jerusalem, and made cedar trees as abundant as sycamore trees in the Shephelah. 
142Ch 9:28 They also kept bringing horses to Solomon from Egypt and from all of the surrounding countries.
142Ch 9:29 Now the rest of Solomon's accomplishments, from first to last, are written in the records of Nathan the prophet, in the prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo the seer pertaining to Nebat's son Jeroboam, are they not?
142Ch 9:30 Solomon reigned for 40 years in Jerusalem over all of Israel. 
142Ch 9:31 Then Solomon died, as had his ancestors, and his son Rehoboam reigned in his place.
142Ch 10:1 Rehoboam traveled to Shechem, because all of Israel went there to install him as king. 
142Ch 10:2 Nebat's son Jeroboam heard about it in Egypt, where he had fled to get away from Solomon the king. Jeroboam returned from Egypt 
142Ch 10:3 after being summoned. When Jeroboam and all of Israel arrived, they spoke to Rehoboam, 
142Ch 10:4 "Your father made our burdens unbearable. Therefore you must lighten your father's requirements and his heavy burden that he placed on us, and we'll serve you."
142Ch 10:5 "Come back again in three days," Rehoboam said to them. So the people left 
142Ch 10:6 while King Rehoboam conferred with his advisors who had worked with his father Solomon during his administration. He asked them, "What is your advice as to what response I should return to these people?"
142Ch 10:7 In reply, they told him, "If you will be kind to this people, please them, and speak appropriately to them with kind words, they'll serve you forever."
142Ch 10:8 But Rehoboam ignored the counsel that his elder advisors had given him. Instead, he consulted the younger men who had grown up with him and worked for him. 
142Ch 10:9 As a result, he asked them, "What's your advice, so we can give an answer to these people who have asked me, 'Please lighten the burden that your father put on us'?"
142Ch 10:10 "This is what you should tell the people who asked you 'Your father made our burden heaven, but you must make it lighter for us!'" the young men who had grown up with Rehoboam replied. "Tell them 'My little finger will be thicker than my father's whole body! 
142Ch 10:11 Not only that, but since my father loaded you down heavily, I'm going to add to that burden. If my father disciplined you with whips, I'm going to do so with scorpions!'"
142Ch 10:12 So Jeroboam and all the people went back to Rehoboam on the third day, just as they had been directed when the king said, "Come back again in three days." 
142Ch 10:13 But the king answered them strictly and ignored the counsel of his elders. 
142Ch 10:14 Instead, Rehoboam spoke to them along the lines of what the younger men suggested. He told them "My father burdened you heavily, but I will add to that burden. If my father disciplined you with whips, I will, too - with scorpions!"
142Ch 10:15 The king would not listen to the people because the turn of events was from God, so that the Lord might fulfill his prediction that he spoke through Nebat's son Ahijah the Shilonite. 
142Ch 10:16 All of Israel - since the king wasn't going to listen to them - the people responded to the king, "What's the point in following David?We have no inheritance in the descendants of Jesse. Let's go home, Israel! David, take care of your own household!' So all of Israel left for home. 
142Ch 10:17 And so Rehoboam ruled over the Israelites who lived in the cities of Judah.1016
142Ch 10:18 King Rehoboam sent Hadoram, who was in charge of conscripted labor, but the Israelites stoned him to death, and King Rehoboam had to jump in his chariot and flee back in a hurry to Jerusalem. 
142Ch 10:19 That's how Israel came to be in rebellion against David's dynasty to this day.
142Ch 11:1 When Rehoboam returned to Jerusalem, he gathered together 180,000 specially chosen soldiers from the households of Judah and Benjamin to fight against Israel and restore the kingdom to Rehoboam. 
142Ch 11:2 But a message from the Lord came to Shemaiah, a man of God£º 
142Ch 11:3 "Tell Solomon's son Rehoboam, king of Judah and all of Israel in Judah and Benjamin£º 
142Ch 11:4 'This is what the Lord says£º "You are not to fight or even to approach your relatives in battle. Every soldier is to return to his own home, for this development comes from me."'" So they listened to what the Lord had to say and called off their attack on Jeroboam.
142Ch 11:5 Rehoboam continued to live in Jerusalem and built defensive fortification cities throughout Judah, 
142Ch 11:6 including Bethlehem, Etam, Tekoa, 
142Ch 11:7 Beth-zur, Soco, Adullam, 
142Ch 11:8 Gath, Mareshah, Ziph, 
142Ch 11:9 Adoraim, Lachish, Zekah, 
142Ch 11:10 Zorah, Aijalon, and Hebron. These were all fortified cities throughout Judah and Benjamin. 
142Ch 11:11 He also strengthened the fortified cities, assigned officers to them, and stockpiled food, oil, and wine. 
142Ch 11:12 He also stockpiled shields and spears in every city and fortified them greatly to secure his rule over Judah and Benjamin.
142Ch 11:13 The priests and Levites throughout Israel also supported him in their districts, 
142Ch 11:14 because the Levites left their pasture lands and their property to live in Judah and Jerusalem, since Jeroboam and his sons had excluded them from participating in priestly services to the Lord. 
142Ch 11:15 Jeroboam had appointed his own priests to serve at the high places and to serve the satyrs and calves that he had made. 
142Ch 11:16 As a result, anyone from all of the tribes of Israel who was determined to seek the Lord God of Israel followed the Levites to Jerusalem so they could sacrifice to the Lord God of their ancestors, 
142Ch 11:17 and they continued to strengthen the kingdom of Judah, supporting Solomon's son Rehoboam for three years, by living the way David and Solomon did for three years.
142Ch 11:18 Rehoboam married Mahalath, the daughter of David's son Jerimoth, along with Abihail, the daughter of Jesse's son Eliab, 
142Ch 11:19 who bore him these sons£º Jeush, Shemariah, and Zaham. 
142Ch 11:20 After this he married Absalom's daughter Maacah, who bore him Abijah, Attai, Ziza, and Shelomith. 
142Ch 11:21 Rehoboam loved Absalom's daughter Maacah more than he did all of his wives and mistresses. (He married eighteen wives and 60 concubines, fathering 28 sons and 60 daughters.) 
142Ch 11:22 Later, Rehoboam appointed Abijah, his son from Maacah, as senior family leader among his brothers, since he intended to establish Abijah as king. 
142Ch 11:23 Rehoboam was wise to distribute some his children throughout all of the territories of Judah and Benjamin, placing them in all of the fortified cities. He allotted them abundant supplies of food and sought many wives for them.
142Ch 12:1 At the height of his power, after he had consolidated his rule, Rehoboam abandoned the Lord's Law, along with all of Israel with him. 
142Ch 12:2 Because he had been unfaithful to the Lord, during the fifth year of King Rehoboam's reign, King Shishak of Egypt attacked Jerusalem 
142Ch 12:3 with 1,200 chariots and 60,000 cavalry. The Lubim, Sukkiim, and the Ethiopians who invaded from Egypt with Shishak were innumerable. 
142Ch 12:4 Shishak captured the fortified cities of Judah and invaded as far as Jerusalem.2
142Ch 12:5 Right then, Shemaiah the prophet approached Rehoboam and the princes of Judah who had gathered together in Jerusalem because of Shishak, and he said to them, "This is what the Lord says£º 'You abandoned me, so I've abandoned you to Shishak.'"
142Ch 12:6 In response, the princes of Israel and the king humbled themselves and declared, "The Lord is righteous."
142Ch 12:7 When the Lord observed that they had humbled themselves, the Lord spoke to Shemaiah, "They have humbled themselves, so I won't destroy them. Instead, I'll grant them some deliverance by not pouring out my indignation on Jerusalem, using Shishak to do it. 
142Ch 12:8 Nevertheless, they will become his slaves so they may learn to differentiate between what it means to serve me and to serve the kingdoms of these nations." 
142Ch 12:9 So King Shishak of Egypt invaded Jerusalem and looted the treasure stores in the Lord's temple and in the royal palace. He took everything, including the golden shields that Solomon had made. 
142Ch 12:10 After this, King Rehoboam made shields out of bronze to take their place, committing them to the care and custody of the commanders of those who guarded the entrance to the royal palace. 
142Ch 12:11 As often as the king entered the Lord's temple, the guards came and transported the shields to the temple and then brought them back to the guard's quarters. 
142Ch 12:12 After he had humbled himself, the Lord stopped being angry with him, and did not destroy Rehoboam completely. Furthermore, conditions became good in Judah.129
142Ch 12:13 King Rehoboam consolidated his reign in Jerusalem. Rehoboam was 41 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that that Lord had chosen from all the tribes of Israel in which to establish his name. Rehoboam's mother was Naamah from Ammon. 
142Ch 12:14 He practiced evil by not setting his heart to seek the Lord. 
142Ch 12:15 Now Rehoboam's accomplishments, from first to last, are written in the records of Shemaiah the prophet and of Iddo the seer, enrolled by genealogy, are they not?
142Ch 12:16 Later, Rehoboam died, as had his ancestors, and his son Abijah became king to replace him.
142Ch 13:1 During the eighteenth year of the reign of King Jeroboam, Abijah became king over Judah. 
142Ch 13:2 He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother was Juriel's daughter Micaiah from Gibeah. A war started between Abijah and Jeroboam. 
142Ch 13:3 Abijah started the battle with an army of 400,000 specially chosen valiant soldiers, but Jeroboam opposed him with 800,000 specially chosen valiant soldiers. 
142Ch 13:4 Abijah stood on Mount Zemaraim in the hill country of Ephraim and announced£º "Listen to me, Jeroboam and Israel! 
142Ch 13:5 Don't you know that the Lord God of Israel assigned the kingship over Israel to David and his descendants forever by a salt covenant?
142Ch 13:6 Even so, Nebat's son Jeroboam, who used to serve David's son Solomon, rose in rebellion against his own master! 
142Ch 13:7 Useless troublemakers soon gathered around him, who turned out to be too strong for Rehoboam, because he was young, timid, and unable to withstand them.
142Ch 13:8 "So now you think you'll be able to withstand the Lord's kingdom as controlled by David's descendants, just because you have a large crown and have brought with you the golden calves that Jeroboam made for you as gods. 
142Ch 13:9 Haven't you already driven away the Lord's priests, the descendants of Aaron and the Levites?Haven't you established your own priests like the people of other lands - 
142Ch 13:10 "Now as far as we're concerned, the Lord is our God, and we haven't abandoned him. The descendants of Aaron are ministering to the Lord as priests, and the Levites continue their work. 
142Ch 13:11 Every morning and evening, they're offering burnt offerings and fragrant incense to the Lord, the showbread is set out on the pure table, and they take care of the golden lamp stand so it's lamps can continue to burn every evening. We continue to be faithful over what the Lord our God entrusted to us, but you have abandoned him. 
142Ch 13:12 Now listen! God is with us to lead us, and his priests are about to sound their battle trumpets against you. Descendants of Israel, don't fight against the Lord God of your ancestors, because you won't succeed!"11
142Ch 13:13 But Jeroboam had sent an ambush to attack from the rear, so Israel was in front of Judah, with the ambush set in place behind them. 
142Ch 13:14 When the army of Judah turned around to look, they were being attacked from both front and rear, so they cried out to the Lord while the priests sounded their trumpets. 
142Ch 13:15 Then the army of Judah sounded a war cry, and God routed Jeroboam and the entire army of Israel in front of Abijah and Judah. 
142Ch 13:16 When the descendants of Israel ran away from the army of Judah, God handed them over to the army of Judah. 
142Ch 13:17 Abijah and his army defeated them in a tremendous slaughter that resulted in 500,000 special forces from Israel being slain. 
142Ch 13:18 And so the descendants of Israel were defeated at that time. The descendants of Judah were victorious because they trusted in the Lord God of their ancestors. 
142Ch 13:19 After this Abijah pursued Jeroboam and captured Bethel and its villages, Jeshanah and its villages, and Ephron and its villages.14
142Ch 13:20 Jeroboam never recovered his strength for the rest of Abijah's life. The Lord struck Jeroboam, and he died, 
142Ch 13:21 but Abijah continued to grow more powerful. He took fourteen wives for himself and fathered 22 sons and sixteen daughters. 
142Ch 13:22 The rest of Abijah's accomplishments, his lifestyle and his memoirs are recorded in the Midrash of the Prophet Iddo. 
142Ch 14:1 Then Abijah died, as had his ancestors, and he was buried in the city of David. Abijah's son Asa reigned in his place, and during his lifetime the land enjoyed rest for ten years.
142Ch 14:2 Asa practiced what the Lord his God considered to be right 
142Ch 14:3 by removing the foreign altars and high places, tearing down the sacred pillars, cutting down the Asherim, and 
142Ch 14:4 commanding Judah to seek the Lord God of their ancestors and to keep the Law and the commandments. 
142Ch 14:5 He also removed the high places and incense altars from all of the cities of Judah. As a result, the kingdom enjoyed rest under Asa's leadership.
142Ch 14:6 Asa built fortified cities throughout Judah while the land lay undisturbed, because the Lord had given him peace so that no one went to war against him during those years. 
142Ch 14:7 He had told Judah, "Let's build up these cities, surrounding them with walls, towers, gates, and bars. The land still belongs to us, because we have kept on seeking the Lord our God. We have sought him out, and he has given us rest all around us." So the people built and prospered. 
142Ch 14:8 Asa kept a standing army of 300,000 soldiers from Judah equipped with large shields and spears, as well as 280,000 soldiers from Benjamin, also bearing shields and wielding bows. All of them were valiant soldiers.
142Ch 14:9 Sometime later, Zerah the Ethiopian went to war against him at Mareshah with an army of one million troops and 300 chariots. 
142Ch 14:10 Asa went out to engage him in battle, and they drew up their battle lines at Mareshah in the Zephathah Valley. 
142Ch 14:11 Asa cried out to the Lord his God, telling him, "Lord, there is no one except for you to help between the powerful and the weak. So help us, Lord God, because we're depending on you and have come against this vast group in your name. Lord, you are our God. Let no mere mortal man defeat you!"
142Ch 14:12 So the Lord defeated the Ethiopians right in front of Asa and Judah, and the Ethiopians ran away. 
142Ch 14:13 Asa and his army pursued the Ethiopians as far as Gerar. So many Ethiopians died that their army could not recover, because it had been shattered in the Lord's presence and in the presence of his army. The Israelites carried off a lot of plunder, too, 
142Ch 14:14 They attacked all the cities that surrounded Gerar, because fear of the Lord had overwhelmed them. The Israelites spoiled all the cities, because there was a lot to plunder in them. 
142Ch 14:15 They also attacked the tents of those who owned livestock and carried off lots of sheep and camels. Then they returned to Jerusalem.1413
142Ch 15:1 After this, the Spirit of the Lord came to rest on Obed's son Azariah, 
142Ch 15:2 so he went out to meet Asa and rebuked him£º "Listen to me, Asa, Judah, and Benjamin! The Lord is with you when you are with him. If you seek him, he will allow you to find him, but if you abandon him, he will abandon you. 
142Ch 15:3 Israel lived for years without the true God, priests to teach them, and the Law, 
142Ch 15:4 but they turned to the Lord God of Israel in their distress. When they sought him, he let them become reacquainted with him.
142Ch 15:5 "During those days, it wasn't safe for anyone to come and go, because many civil disturbances afflicted everyone who lived in the territories. 
142Ch 15:6 Nation battled nation, and city fought city, because God was afflicted them all with every kind of distress. 
142Ch 15:7 Now as for you, be strong and never be discouraged, because there will be reward for your work.
142Ch 15:8 Encouraged by what Oded's son Azariah the prophet had said in his prophecy, Asa removed the detestable idols from throughout the entire territories of Judah and Benjamin, and from the cities that he had captured in the hill country of Ephraim. He repaired the Lord's altar that stood in front of the vestibule of the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 15:9 Then he gathered together all of Judah, Benjamin, and people from Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon who were living among them, since many people had defected to him from Israel when they learned that the Lord his God was with him. 
142Ch 15:10 They all assembled in Jerusalem during the third month of the fifteen year of Asa's reign. 
142Ch 15:11 They sacrificed to the Lord that day 700 oxen and 7,000 sheep from they spoil that they had brought with them. 
142Ch 15:12 They also entered into a covenant to seek the Lord God of their ancestors with all their heart and soul, 
142Ch 15:13 and they further agreed that whoever would refuse to seek the Lord God of Israel was to be executed, whether important or unimportant, man of woman. 
142Ch 15:14 They also made a vow to the Lord with loud voices, shouting, trumpets, and horns. 
142Ch 15:15 Everybody in Judah was very glad to make their oath, because they had made their vow with all their heart and had sought him with all of their might, and they found him! The Lord also gave them rest in their surrounding lands.15
142Ch 15:16 King Asa removed his mother Maacah from her position as Queen Mother because she had made a detestable image dedicated to Asherah. He cut down his mother's idol, crushed it, and burned it at the Kidron Brook. 
142Ch 15:17 Nevertheless, the high places were not removed from Israel, even though Asa's heart was blameless all of his life. 
142Ch 15:18 Asa brought into God's temple the things that his father had dedicated, as well as his own dedicated gifts such as silver, gold, and temple service implements. 
142Ch 15:19 Asa experienced no more war until the end of the thirty-fifth year of his reign.15
142Ch 16:1 During the thirty-sixth year of Asa's reign, King Baasha of Israel invaded Judah and interdicted Ramah by building fortifications around it so no one could enter or leave to join King Asa of Judah. 
142Ch 16:2 But Asa removed some silver and gold from the treasuries of the Lord's temple and from his royal palace and sent them to King Ben-hadad of Aram, who lived in Damascus. 
142Ch 16:3 "Let's make a treaty between you and me," he said, "just like the one between my father and your father. Notice that I've sent you silver and gold to break your treaty with King Baasha of Israel, so he'll retreat from his attack on me."2
142Ch 16:4 So King Ben-hadad did just what King Asa had asked£º he sent his commanding officers to attack the cities of Israel. They conquered Ijon, Dan, Bel-maim, and all of the storage centers in Naphtali. 
142Ch 16:5 When Baasha learned of the attack, he withdrew from Ramah and stopped his interdiction. 
142Ch 16:6 Then King Asa brought his entire army of Judah to carry away the building stones and the timber that Baasha had been using to surround Ramah, and he used those materials to fortify Geba and Mizpah.
142Ch 16:7 Right about then, Hanani the seer came to King Asa of Judah and rebuked him. "Because you have put your trust in the king of Aram and have not relied on the Lord your God, the army of the king of Aram has escaped from your control. 
142Ch 16:8 Weren't the Ethiopians and the Libyans a vast army with many chariots and cavalry?Yet because you relied on the Lord, he gave them into your control! The Lord's eyes keep on roaming throughout the earth, looking for those whose hearts completely belong to him, so that he may strongly support them. But because you have acted 142Ch 16:foolishly in this, from now on you will have wars." 
142Ch 16:10 In response, Asa flew into a rage and locked up the seer in stocks in the palace prison because of what Hanani had told him. Asa also tortured some of the people of Israel at that time.
142Ch 16:11 Now the accomplishments of Asa from first to last are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah. 
142Ch 16:12 In the thirty-ninth year of his reign, Asa suffered from a foot disease. Even though he suffered greatly, he never sought the Lord, but instead looked to doctors. 
142Ch 16:13 As a result, in the forty-first year of his reign, Asa died, as had his ancestors, 
142Ch 16:14 and he was buried in his own tomb that he had prepared for himself in the city of David. He was laid out on a bier that had been filled with various spices prepared by morticians, and the mourners built a massive bonfire to honor his memory. 
142Ch 17:1 Asa's son Jehoshaphat succeeded him as king, and he consolidated his authority over Israel 
142Ch 17:2 by placing troops in all of the fortified citadels through Judah and by establishing garrisons throughout the land of Judah and in the cities that his father Asa had captured.
142Ch 17:3 The Lord was with Jehoshaphat because he followed the example set during his ancestor David's preliminary years by not pursuing the Baals. 
142Ch 17:4 Instead, Jehoshaphat sought the God of his ancestors and obeyed his commands, unlike Israel. 
142Ch 17:5 Therefore the Lord secured Jehoshaphat's kingdom under his control, with all of Judah paying him tribute, and Jehoshaphat became very wealthy and greatly respected. 
142Ch 17:6 He remained committed to following the Lord, and he removed the high places and Asherah poles from Judah.
142Ch 17:7 During the third year of his reign, Jehoshaphat sent his officials Ben-Hail, Obadiah, Zechariah, Nethanel, and Micaiah to teach throughout the cities of Judah. 
142Ch 17:8 They were accompanied by the Levites, including Shemaiah, Nethaniah, Zebadiah, Ashael, Shemiramoth, Jehonathan, Adonijah, Tobijah, and Tobadonijah. These Levites were accompanied by the priests Elishama and Jehoram. 
142Ch 17:9 They taught throughout Judah from a copy of the book of the Law of the Lord that they took with them as they passed through all the cities of Judah, teaching among all the people.
142Ch 17:10 Because they were afraid of the Lord, none of the kingdoms of the lands that surrounded Judah dared go to war against Jehoshaphat. 
142Ch 17:11 Some of the Philistines brought gifts and silver as tribute to Jehoshaphat, and Arabians brought him flocks of 7,700 rams and 7,700 male goats. 
142Ch 17:12 As a result, Jehoshaphat grew more and more powerful, and built up fortresses and storage centers throughout Judah. 
142Ch 17:13 He placed a large amount of supplies into storage throughout the cities of Judah and stationed soldiers - all of them valiant men - in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 17:14 Here's how they were mustered, listed according to their ancestral houses and listed by commanders of thousand£º Adnah commanded 300,000 elite forces. 
142Ch 17:15 Near him was Johanan, commander of 280,000 
142Ch 17:16 and next to him was Zichri's son Amasiah, who had volunteered to serve the Lord. He commanded 200,000 elite forces. 
142Ch 17:17 There was also Eliada from Benjamin, himself a valiant soldier. He was accompanied by 200,000 expert archers bearing shields. 
142Ch 17:18 Near him was Jehozabad, who was accompanied by 180,000 soldiers equipped for warfare. 
142Ch 17:19 These men served the king, and there were others whom the king garrisoned inside fortified cities throughout all of Judah.1710
142Ch 18:1 After Jehoshaphat had become wealthy and was enjoying abundant honor, he allied himself to Ahab. 
142Ch 18:2 After a few years, he visited Ahab in Samaria. Ahab slaughtered lots of sheep and oxen for him, and the people who were with him persuaded Jehoshaphat to attack Ramoth-gilead. 
142Ch 18:3 King Ahab of Israel asked King Jehoshaphat of Judah, "Will you join me in attacking Ramoth-gilead?" "I'm with you," Jehoshaphat replied. "and my army is with you. We'll join you in the battle." 
142Ch 18:4 But then Jehoshaphat asked the king of Israel, "Please ask for a message from the Lord, first."
142Ch 18:5 So the king of Israel gathered together 400 prophets and asked them, "Should we go attack Ramoth-gilead, or should I call off the attack?" "Go attack them," they all said, "because God will drop them right in the king's hand."
142Ch 18:6 But Jehoshaphat asked, "Isn't there a prophet of the Lord left here that we could talk to?"
142Ch 18:7 "There is still one man left by whom we could ask the Lord what to do," the king of Israel replied to Jehoshaphat, "but I hate him because he won't prophesy anything good about me. Instead, he always prophesies evil. He is Imla's son Micaiah." But Jehoshaphat rebuked Ahab, "Kings should never talk like that."
142Ch 18:8 Nevertheless, the king of Israel called an officer and ordered him, "Bring me Imla's son Micaiah quickly."
142Ch 18:9 Now the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah were each sitting on their own thrones, arrayed in their robes, and sitting on the threshing floor at the entrance to the city gate of Samaria, and all of the prophets were prophesying in front of them. 
142Ch 18:10 Chenaanah's son Zedekiah made iron horns for himself and told them, "This is what the Lord says, 'With these horns you are to gore the Arameans until they are eliminated!'"
142Ch 18:11 All the other prophets were saying similar things, like "Go up to Ramoth-gilead and you will be successful, because the Lord will hand it over to the king!"
142Ch 18:12 Meanwhile, the messenger who had gone off to summon Micaiah advised him, "Look, everything that the other prophets were saying has been unanimously favorable to the king. So please, cooperate with them and speak favorably."
142Ch 18:13 "As the Lord lives," Micaiah replied, "I'll say what my God tells me to say."
142Ch 18:14 When Micaiah approached the king, the king asked him, "Micaiah, should we go to war against Ramoth-gilead, or should I not?" "Go to war," Micaiah replied, "and you will be successful, because the Lord will hand it over to the king!"
142Ch 18:15 When he heard this, the king asked him, "How many times do I have to ask you?Tell me nothing but the truth, and do it in the name of the Lord!"
142Ch 18:16 And so Micaiah replied£º I saw all of Israel scattered on the mountains like sheep without a shepherd. And the Lord told me, 'These have no master, so let them each return to his own home in peace.'"
142Ch 18:17 Then the king of Israel told Jehoshaphat, "Didn't I tell you that he wouldn't prophesy anything good about me, but only evil?"
142Ch 18:18 But Micaiah responded, "Therefore, listen to what the Lord has to say. I saw the Lord, sitting on his throne, and the entire Heavenly Army was surrounding him on his right hand and on his left hand.
142Ch 18:19 "The Lord asked, 'Who will tempt King Ahab of Israel to attack Ramoth-gilead, so that he will die there?' And one was saying one thing and one was saying another.
142Ch 18:20 "But then a spirit approached, stood in front of the Lord, and said, 'I will entice him.' "And the Lord asked him, 'How?'
142Ch 18:21 "'I will go,' he announced, 'and I will be a deceiving spirit in the mouth of all of his prophets!' "So the Lord said, 'You're just the one to deceive him. You will be successful. Go and do it.'
142Ch 18:22 Now therefore, listen! The Lord has placed a lying spirit in the mouth of all of these prophets of yours, because the Lord has determined to bring disaster upon you."
142Ch 18:23 As if on cue, Chenaanah's son Zedekiah approached Micaiah and struck him on the cheek. Then he asked him, "How did the Spirit of the Lord move from me to speak to you?"18
142Ch 18:24 Micaiah replied, "You'll learn the answer to that question when the day comes that you run away to hide yourself in a closet!"
142Ch 18:25 Then the king of Israel ordered, "Take Micaiah and place him in the custody of Amon, the city governor. Hand him over to Joash, the king's son. 
142Ch 18:26 Give him this order£º 'Place him in prison on survival rations only until I come back safely.'"
142Ch 18:27 "If you return alive," Micaiah responded, "then the Lord has not spoken by me." Then he added, "Listen, everybody!"
142Ch 18:28 So the king of Israel and King Jehoshaphat of Judah both attacked Ramoth-gilead. 
142Ch 18:29 The king of Israel suggested to Jehoshaphat, "I'll go into battle in disguise, but you keep your royal uniform on." So the king of Israel disguised himself and they both went into the battle.
142Ch 18:30 Meanwhile, the king of Aram had issued these orders to his chariot commanders£º "Don't attack unimportant soldiers or ranking officers. Go after only the king of Israel." 
142Ch 18:31 So when the chariot commanders observed Jehoshaphat, they said by mistake, "It's the king of Israel!" and they turned aside to attack him. But Jehoshaphat cried out to the Lord, who helped him, and God diverted them from him. 
142Ch 18:32 When the chariot commanders saw that their target was not the king of Israel, they stopped pursuing him.
142Ch 18:33 Meanwhile, somebody drew his bow and struck the king of Israel at a weak spot where his armor plates joined, so he instructed his chariot driver, "Turn around and take me out of the battle, because I've been severely wounded." 
142Ch 18:34 The battle continued on for the rest of the day while the king of Israel propped himself up in front of the Arameans until the sun set, at which time he died."
142Ch 19:1 After this, King Jehoshaphat of Judah returned safely to his palace in Jerusalem, 
142Ch 19:2 where Hanani's son Jehu, the seer, went out to meet him. He asked king Jehoshaphat, "Should you be helping those who are wicked, yes or no?Should you love those who hate the Lord?Wrath is headed your way directly from the Lord because of this. 
142Ch 19:3 Nevertheless, a few good things have been found in you, in that you have removed the Asheroth from the land and you have disciplined yourself to seek God." 
142Ch 19:4 Jehoshaphat continued to live in Jerusalem, but he travelled again throughout the people from Beersheba to Mount Ephraim, bringing them back to the Lord God of their ancestors 
142Ch 19:5 and appointing judges throughout the land in all of the walled cities of Judah, city by city. He issued this reminder to the judges:
142Ch 19:6 "Pay careful attention to your duties, because you are judging not only for the sake of human beings but also for the LORD - and he is present with you as you make your rulings. 
142Ch 19:7 So let the fear of the LORD rest upon you, be on your guard, and act carefully, because with the LORD our God there is neither injustice, nor partiality, nor bribery."19
142Ch 19:8 In Jerusalem, Jehoshaphat also appointed certain Levites, priests, and family leaders of Israel to render verdicts for the Lord and to decide difficult cases. Their offices were in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 19:9 He issued this reminder to them£º "You are to carry out your duties in the fear of the Lord, serving him faithfully with your whole heart. 
142Ch 19:10 No matter what case comes before you from your fellow citizens who live in their own cities, whether it's a dispute between blood relatives or a dispute regarding the Law and the commands, statutes, or verdicts, you are to warn the parties so that they do not become guilty in the Lord's presence and so that anger does not come upon you and your fellow citizens. 
142Ch 19:11 Take notice, please, that Amariah the Chief Priest is presiding over all cases that pertain to the Lord, Ishmael's son Zebadiah is presiding as ruler of the household of Judah with respect to all cases that pertain to the national government, and the Levites will preside over your other civil cases. Serve courageously, and the Lord will be with the upright."
142Ch 20:1 Sometime after these events, the Moabites and the Ammonites, accompanied by some other descendants of Ammon, attacked Jehoshaphat and started a war. 
142Ch 20:2 Jehoshaphat's military advisors came and informed him, "We've been attacked by a vast invasion force from Aram, beyond the Dead Sea. Be advised - they've already reached Hazazon-Tamar, also known as Engedi." 
142Ch 20:3 In mounting fear, Jehoshaphat devoted himself to seek the Lord. He proclaimed a period of fasting throughout all of the territory of Judah, 
142Ch 20:4 and the tribe of Judah assembled together to seek the Lord. People came from all of the cities of Judah to seek the Lord.3
142Ch 20:5 Jehoshaphat stood among the assembly of Judah and Jerusalem in the Lord's temple in the vicinity of the new court 
142Ch 20:6 and said£º "Lord God of our ancestors, you are the God who lives in heaven, are you not?You rule over all the kingdoms of the nations, do you not?In your own hands you grasp both strength and power, do you not?As a result, no one can oppose you, can they?
142Ch 20:7 You are our God, who expelled the former inhabitants of this land right in front of our people Israel, are you not?Then you gave it to your friend Abraham's descendant forever, did you not?
142Ch 20:8 They lived in it and have built there a sanctuary for your name, where they said, 
142Ch 20:9 'If evil comes upon us, such as war as punishment, disease, or famine and we stand in your presence in this temple (because your Name is in this temple) and cry out to you in our distress, then you will hear and deliver.' 
142Ch 20:10 Now therefore look! The Ammonites, the Moabites, and inhabitants of Mount Seir, whom you would not permit Israel to attack when they arrived from the land of Egypt - since they turned away from them and did not eliminate them?
142Ch 20:11 Look how they're rewarding us! They're coming to drive us from your property that you gave us to be our inheritance. 
142Ch 20:12 Our God, you are going to punish them, won't you?We have no strength to face this vast multitude that has come against us, nor do we know what to do, except that our eyes are on you."10
142Ch 20:13 All of Judah was standing in the Lord's presence, along with their little babies, their wives, and their children. 
142Ch 20:14 Then the Spirit of the Lord came upon Zechariah's son Jahaziel, the son of Benaiah, the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite from the descendants of Asaph in the middle of the assembly, and he said:
142Ch 20:15 "Pay attention, everyone in Judah, in Jerusalem, and you, too, King Jehoshaphat! This is what the Lord says to you£º 'Stop being afraid, and stop being discouraged because of this vast invasion force, because the battle doesn't belong to you, but to God. 
142Ch 20:16 Tomorrow you are to go down to attack them. Pay attention, now - they'll be coming up near the ascent of Ziz. You'll find them at the end of the valley that looks out over the Jeruel wilderness. 
142Ch 20:17 You won't be fighting in this battle. Take your stand, but stand still, and watch the Lord's salvation on your behalf, Judah and Jerusalem! Never fear and never be discouraged. Go out to face them tomorrow, since the Lord is with you.'"
142Ch 20:18 Jehoshaphat bowed down with his face to the ground, and all the assembled inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem fell face down in the Lord's presence and worshipped the Lord. 
142Ch 20:19 Levites from the descendants of the Kohathites and the Korahites stood up to praise the Lord God of Israel in a very loud voice that ascended to heaven.
142Ch 20:20 The army got up early the next morning and headed out into the wilderness of Tekoa. Jehoshaphat stood up and addressed them. "Listen to me, you inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem," he said. "Have faith in the Lord your God and you'll be established! Have faith in his prophets and you'll succeed!" 
142Ch 20:21 After he had consulted with the people, Jehoshaphat appointed some choir members to sing to the Lord and to praise him in sacred splendor as they marched out in front of the armed forces. They kept saying "Give thanks to the Lord, because his gracious love is eternal!"
142Ch 20:22 Right on time, as they began to sing and praise, the Lord ambushed the Ammonites, Moabites, and the inhabitants of Mount Seir who had attacked Judah, and they were defeated. 
142Ch 20:23 The Ammonites and Moabites attacked the inhabitants of Mount Seir, destroying them, and after they had finished with the inhabitants of Mount Seir, they worked on destroying one another!
142Ch 20:24 When the army of Judah arrived at the remotest watchtower in the wilderness, they looked around at the invasion force, and to their surprise, there were dead bodies lying all around on the ground - not one had escaped! 
142Ch 20:25 Later on, when Jehoshaphat and his army arrived to collect the spoils of war, they discovered there were far more goods, garments, and other valuable items to collect than they could carry off in a single day. There was so much material that it took three days to finish their collection efforts.
142Ch 20:26 Three days later, they assembled together in the Beracah Valley, where they blessed the Lord, which is why the name of that place is called Beracah Valley to this day. 
142Ch 20:27 Then they all returned with joy to Jerusalem, every soldier from Judah and Jerusalem, with Jehoshaphat at the head of the procession, because the Lord had made them rejoice over their enemies. 
142Ch 20:28 They proceeded directly to the Lord's temple, carrying lyres, harps, and trumpets. 
142Ch 20:29 Fear of God seized all of the kingdoms in the surrounding territories when they heard that the Lord had battled Israel's enemies. 
142Ch 20:30 As a result, Jehoshaphat's kingdom enjoyed peace, because his God had provided rest for him all around.2027
142Ch 20:31 Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah, having become king at the age of 35. He reigned in Jerusalem for 25 years. His mother's name was Azubah, the daughter of Shilhi. 
142Ch 20:32 He followed the example of his father Asa and never departed from it, practicing what the Lord considered to be right. 
142Ch 20:33 However, the high places were not removed, since the people had not yet directed their hearts to the God of their ancestors. 
142Ch 20:34 The rest of Jehoshaphat's accomplishments, from first to last, are recorded in the annals of Hanani's son Jehua, which appears in the Book of the Kings of Israel.
142Ch 20:35 Sometime later, King Jehoshaphat of Judah entered into a military alliance with King Ahaziah of Israel, acting wickedly by doing so. 
142Ch 20:36 He also agreed with King Ahaziah to build ships to sail toward Tarshish, which they built in Ezion-geber. 
142Ch 20:37 But Dodavahu's son Eliezer from Mareshah prophesied in opposition to Jehoshaphat, "Because you have entered into an alliance with Ahaziah, the Lord has destroyed your efforts." So the ships were destroyed and were never able to sail for Tarshish.
142Ch 21:1 Jehoshaphat died, as had his ancestors, and was buried in the city of David alongside his ancestors. His son Jehoram became king in his place. 
142Ch 21:2 Jehoshaphat's sons, Jehoram's brothers, included Azariah, Jehiel, Zechariah, Azariah, Michael, and Shephatiah. All of these were sons of Jehoshaphat, king of Israel.
142Ch 21:3 Their father gave them many gifts made of silver, and gold, as well as valuable things, along with fortified cities in Judah, but he passed the kingdom to Jehoram because Jehoram was his firstborn. 
142Ch 21:4 But after Jehoram had assumed the throne and consolidated his rule over his father's kingdom, he executed all of his brothers, along with some of the rulers of Israel. 
142Ch 21:5 Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king, and he reigned for eight years in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 21:6 He lived like the kings of Israel, following the example of Ahab's dynasty, since he had married Ahab's daughter, and he practiced what the Lord considered to be evil. 
142Ch 21:7 Nevertheless, the Lord was unwilling to destroy David's dynasty because of the covenant that he had made with David, especially since he had promised to give him and to his sons the reigning presence of an heir forever.
142Ch 21:8 Nevertheless, Edom revolted against Judah's rule and set up their own king to rule them during Jehoram's reign. 
142Ch 21:9 So Jehoram invaded Edom with his commanders and his chariots by night and killed the Edomites who had surrounded him and his chariot commanders. 
142Ch 21:10 Edom remains in revolt against Judah to this day. Libnah revolted against Jehoram's rule, too, because he had abandoned the Lord God of his ancestors. 
142Ch 21:11 In addition to all of this, he built high places in the mountains of Judah, led the inhabitants of Jerusalem into cultic sexual immorality, and made Judah go astray.
142Ch 21:12 After this, a letter arrived from Elijah the prophet. It said£º "This is what the Lord God of your ancestor David says£º 'You haven't lived like your father Jehoshaphat and like King Asa of Judah. 
142Ch 21:13 Instead, you have lived like the kings of Israel by causing Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit cultic sexual immorality - just like Ahab's dynasty did! And you've killed your brothers who were better than you - your own father's dynasty! 
142Ch 21:14 Look what's going to happen! The Lord is going to strike your people, your children, your wives, and everything you own with a massive tragedy. 
142Ch 21:15 And as for you, you will suffer from a serious disease of your bowels. Eventually, day-by-day you will excrete your own bowels because of this disease."2114
142Ch 21:16 The Lord also provoked the attitude of the Philistines and the Arabs who bordered the Ethiopians against Jehoram, 
142Ch 21:17 and they attacked Judah, invading it and carried off everything he owned in his royal palace, along with all of his sons and wives except for his youngest son Jehoahaz.21
142Ch 21:18 After all of this happened, the Lord struck him in his bowels with an incurable illness. 
142Ch 21:19 Two years later, in due course his bowels came out because of his sickness and he died in agony. His people lit no memorial bonfire for him as they had done for his ancestors. 
142Ch 21:20 Jehoram was 32 years old when he became king, and he reigned in Jerusalem for eight years. He left this earth - to nobody's regret - and they buried him in the city of David, but not in the tombs of the kings.
142Ch 22:1 The residents of Jerusalem made Jehoram's son Ahaziah king in his place after the raiding party that had invaded the city with the Arabs had killed all of the older sons. That's how Jehoram's son Ahaziah became king of Judah. 
142Ch 22:2 Ahaziah was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned for one year in Jerusalem. His mother was Athaliah, Omri's granddaughter.
142Ch 22:3 He followed the example of Ahab's dynasty because his mother gave him evil counsel. 
142Ch 22:4 So he practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, just like Ahab's dynasty had done, because after his father died, he was given advice that resulted in his destruction. 
142Ch 22:5 He followed their counsel and accompanied Ahab's son Joram, king of Israel, to wage war against King Hazael of Aram at Ramoth-gilead. But the Arameans wounded Joram, 
142Ch 22:6 so he returned to Jezreel to recover from the wounds that he had received at Ramah in the battle against King Hazael of Aram. King Ahaziah of Judah, Jehoram's son, went to visit Ahab's son Joram, because he was wounded.
142Ch 22:7 God used Ahaziah's visit to Joram to destroy Ahaziah. As soon as he arrived, Ahaziah went out with Joram to attack Nimshi's son Jehu, whom the Lord had appointed to eliminate Ahab's dynasty. 
142Ch 22:8 And that's exactly what happened. While Jehu was punishing Ahab's dynasty, he located the princes of Judah and the sons of Ahaziah's brothers who were ministering to Ahaziah, and he put them to death. 
142Ch 22:9 Jehu also searched for Ahaziah, had him apprehended while Ahaziah was hiding out in Samaria, and had Ahaziah brought to him. Jehu had Ahaziah executed and buried. It was said of Jehu, "He is the son of Jehoshaphat, who sought the Lord with all of his heart." As a result, there was no one left in the household of Ahaziah strong enough to reign in the kingdom.
142Ch 22:10 As soon as Ahaziah's mother Athaliah learned that her son had died, she set out to destroy the entire royal family of Judah. 
142Ch 22:11 However, the king's daughter Jehoshabeath took Ahaziah's son Joash away from the king's children who were about to be assassinated and hid him and his nurse in a bedroom. That's how King Jehoram's daughter Jehoshabeath, who was also the priest Jehoiada's wife and Ahaziah's sister, hid him from Athaliah. As a result, she was not able to kill him. 
142Ch 22:12 Joash remained with them for six years, hidden in God's temple while Athaliah reigned over the land.
142Ch 23:1 Seven years later, Jehoiada mustered up some courage and made a deal with the officers who commanded units of hundred of soldiers, including Jehoram's son Azariah, Jehochanan's son Ishmael, Obed's son Azariah, Adaiah's son Maaseiah, and Zikri's son Elishaphat. 
142Ch 23:2 They traveled throughout Judah and gathered together the Levites from all the cities of Judah, along with the Israelite family leaders. 
142Ch 23:3 Everybody went to Jerusalem, and the whole group made a covenant with the king in God's temple, where Jehoiada addressed them£º "Look! The king's son is going to rule, just as the Lord promised David's descendants. 
142Ch 23:4 So here's what you'll need to do£º One third of you priests and Levites who are on duty during the Sabbath will serve as guards at the temple gates. 
142Ch 23:5 Another third of you priests and Levites will take your places in the royal palace, while another third of you priests and Levites will stand near the Foundation Gate. The rest of you will remain in the courtyard of the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 23:6 Nobody is to enter the Lord's temple except for the priests and Levites who are on duty. They may enter because they are ceremonially holy, but all the rest of the people must observe the Lord's instructions. 
142Ch 23:7 The Levites will surround the king, brandishing weapons in their hands, and anybody who enters the temple will be killed. Stay near the king wherever he enters and leaves."
142Ch 23:8 What Jehoiada the priest ordered is precisely what the Levites and all of Judah did. Each of them took the men who were on duty on the Sabbath as well as those who were off duty. Jehoiada the priest did not release the divisions from service, 
142Ch 23:9 and Jehoiada the priest issued the spears and shields that King David had placed in storage in God's temple to the officers in charge of the units of hundreds. 
142Ch 23:10 He set the rest of the people to serve as guards for the king, and each one brandished weapons in his hand, from the south side of the temple to the north side of the temple, around the altar, and surrounding the palace. 
142Ch 23:11 Then he brought out the king's son, put a crown on him, and presented him with the Testimony,
142Ch 23:12 When Athaliah heard all the commotion of the people running around and praising the king, she went straight to the Lord's temple to confront the people. 
142Ch 23:13 She looked around, and there was the king, standing by his pillar at the gate, accompanied by officers and trumpeters who stood beside the king, along with all the people of the land rejoicing and sounding trumpets while singers lead the celebration with their musical instruments. Athaliah tore her robes and yelled "Treason! Treason!"
142Ch 23:14 But Jehoiada the priest summoned the captains of hundreds who had been appointed in charge over the army and ordered them, "Bring her out between the ranks, and execute anyone who follows her. " The priest also told them, "Don't execute her in the Lord's temple." 
142Ch 23:15 So they arrested her when she arrived at the entrance to the Horse Gate near the royal palace, they executed her there.
142Ch 23:16 After this, Jehoiada drew up a covenant between himself as an individual with all the people, and between himself as king, that they would be the Lord's people. 
142Ch 23:17 Then all the people went to the temple of Baal, broke its altars and idols to pieces, and executed Mattan, the priest of Baal, in front of the altars. 
142Ch 23:18 Jehoiada also placed the offices of the Lord's temple under the authority of the Levitical priests whom David had assigned over the Lord's temple, just as is required by the Law of Moses, to offer the Lord's burnt offerings with joy and singing, just as David had ordered. 
142Ch 23:19 Jehoiada also stationed inspectors at the Lord's temple so that no one would enter who was ritually unclean in any manner. 
142Ch 23:20 He also took the captains of hundreds, the nobles, the people's governors, and all the people of the land, and they all marched with the king from the Lord's temple through the upper gate to the royal palace, where they installed the king on his royal throne. 21There all of the people of the land rejoiced and the city stayed quiet, because they had executed Athaliah by sword.2320
142Ch 24:1 Joash was seven years old when he began his reign, and he reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Zibiah. She was from Beersheba. 
142Ch 24:2 Joash practiced what the Lord considered to be right during the lifetime of Jehoiada the priests, 
142Ch 24:3 who found two wives for him, so he fathered sons and daughters.
142Ch 24:4 Later on, Joash decided to rebuild the Lord's temple, 
142Ch 24:5 so he assembled the priests and Levites and ordered them, "Go throughout the cities of Judah and take up a collection from all of Israel for the annual upkeep of the temple of your God. And make sure that you act quickly." But the Levites did not act quickly, 
142Ch 24:6 so the king summoned Jehoiada the chief priest and asked him, "Why haven't you required the Levites to bring from Judah and Jerusalem the tax levied by Moses, the Lord's servant, and the assembly of Israel for the tent of testimony?"
142Ch 24:7 Because that wicked woman Athaliah's family members had broken into the temple of God and used the consecrated implements of the Lord's temple for service to the Baals, 
142Ch 24:8 the king issued an order and a chest was made and set outside the entrance gate to the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 24:9 A public notice was sent throughout Judah and Jerusalem to bring in the tax that Moses the servant of the Lord had levied on Israel when they were in the wilderness. 
142Ch 24:10 So all the princes and all the people gladly brought their tax and placed it into the chest until they had completed paying the tax. 
142Ch 24:11 Whenever the chest was brought to the king's officials by the Levites, the royal secretary and the chief priests designated officer would come, empty the chest, and take it back to its place. They did this day after day until they had collected a large amount of cash.
142Ch 24:12 Both the king and Jehoiada paid the money to those who were working to maintain the service of the Lord's temple, and they, in turn, hired masons and carpenters to restore the Lord's temple. Iron and bronze workers also were brought in to repair the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 24:13 As a result, the workmen did their labor, and the repair work progressed steadily under their supervision, and they restored God's temple back to what it should be, and strengthened it, too. 
142Ch 24:14 When they had completed the work, they brought what was left of the money to the king and to Jehoiada, and it was used to cast utensils for the Lord's temple that were to be utilized for daily service and for burnt offerings, for incense vessels, and for both gold and silver vessels. Burnt offerings were offered on a regular basis in the Lord's temple throughout Jehoiada's lifetime.
142Ch 24:15 Eventually, Jehoiada grew old and died at the age of 130 years, after having lived a full life. 
142Ch 24:16 He was buried in the city of David among the graves of the kings, because he had accomplished many good things in Israel on behalf of God and his temple. 
142Ch 24:17 But after Jehoiada had died, officials from Judah came, bowed down to the king, and the king listened to what they had to say. 
142Ch 24:18 They abandoned the Lord's temple and the God of their fathers, and they served Asherim and idols. As a result this guilt of theirs resulted in wrath coming upon Judah and Jerusalem. 
142Ch 24:19 Nevertheless, God sent prophets among them to bring them back to the Lord.
142Ch 24:20 Then Jehoiada the priest's son Zechariah was clothed by the Spirit of God, and he stood above the people and told them, "This is what God has to say£º 'Why are you breaking the Lord's commandments. You'll never be successful! Because you have abandoned the Lord, he has abandoned you.'"
142Ch 24:21 But the people conspired against him, and at the direct orders of the king they stoned him to death in the courtyard of the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 24:22 This is how King Joash failed to remember the kindness that Zechariah's father Jehoiada had shown him£º he killed his son. As he lay dying, Zechariah cried out, "May the Lord watch this and avenge."
142Ch 24:23 At the end of that year, the Aramean army attacked Joash. They invaded Judah and Jerusalem, destroyed every senior official among the people, and sent all of their possessions to the king of Damascus. 
142Ch 24:24 The Aramean army attacked with only a small force, but the Lord delivered a much larger army into their control because Judah had abandoned the Lord God of their ancestors. And so the Aramean army carried out God's judgment on Joash. 
142Ch 24:25 After the Arameans left him very sick, Joash's own servants conspired against him because Joash had murdered Jehoiada the priest's son, and they killed him on his sick bed. 
142Ch 24:26 The conspirators included Shimeath the Ammonite's son Zabad and Shimrith the Moabite's son Jehozabad. 
142Ch 24:27 Records concerning his sons, the various prophetic statements rebuking him, and records of the reconstruction work on God's temple are written in the Midrash of the Book of the Kings. Joash's son Amaziah reigned in his place.2423
142Ch 25:1 Amaziah began his reign at the age of 25 years, and he reigned 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jehoaddan. She was from Jerusalem. 
142Ch 25:2 He practiced what the Lord considered to be right, but not with a perfect heart. 
142Ch 25:3 As soon as he had consolidated his royal authority, he executed the servants who had killed his father, the king, 
142Ch 25:4 but he did not execute their children in obedience to what is written in the Law, the writings of Moses, where the Lord commanded, "Fathers are not to die because of what their children do, nor are children to die because of what their children do, but each person shall die for his own sins."
142Ch 25:5 Amaziah gathered Judah together and organized them according to their ancestral households under commanders of thousands and hundreds throughout Judah and Benjamin. He then mustered an army from those who were 20 years old and older. He discovered that there were 300,000 elite soldiers qualified for war duty and capable of handling spears and shields. 
142Ch 25:6 He also hired 100,000 elite forces from Israel, paying 7,500 pounds of silver for their services.
142Ch 25:7 A man came from God and warned him, "Your majesty, don't let the army of Israel accompany you into battle, because the Lord isn't with any of the descendants of Ephraim. 
142Ch 25:8 But if you do go, strengthen yourself for war. Do you think God will throw you down before the enemy, since God has the power both to help or to overthrow?"
142Ch 25:9 Amaziah asked the man of God, "What are we to do about the 7,500 pounds that I have paid to the army of Israel?" The man of God answered, "The Lord has a lot more than that to give you!" 
142Ch 25:10 So Amaziah sent the troops home who had arrived from Ephraim. They flew into a rage against Judah but left for home very angry.
142Ch 25:11 But Amaziah encouraged himself and led his army out to the Salt Valley to kill 10,000 soldiers from Seir. 
142Ch 25:12 The army of Judah captured another 10,000 prisoners and took them to the top of a cliff and threw them down from there where they all were dashed to pieces. 
142Ch 25:13 Meanwhile, the troops that Amaziah had sent home from the battle raided the cities of Judah from Samariah to Beth-horon, killing 3,000 people and taking a large amount of war booty.
142Ch 25:14 Later, Amaziah returned from slaughtering the Edomites, but he brought back the gods that had belonged to the men of Seir, set them up as his own gods, worshiped them, and sacrificed offerings to them. 
142Ch 25:15 As a result, the Lord became angry with Amaziah and sent a prophet to him, who asked him, "Why did you seek the gods of a people who were unable to deliver their own nation from you?"
142Ch 25:16 But even while the prophet was speaking, the king asked him, "Did we appoint you to be a royal counselor?Stop! Why should you be struck down?" So the prophet stopped speaking, but he also said, "I know God has determined to destroy you, because you've done all this and ignored my counsel."
142Ch 25:17 After this, King Amaziah of Judah sought some advice and then challenged Jehoahaz' son King Joash of Israel, the grandson of Jehu, telling him, "Come out and let's fight each other!"
142Ch 25:18 But King Joash of Israel replied to King Amaziah of Judah, "There once was a thorn bush in Lebanon that sent an invitation to the cedar of Lebanon that read 'Give your daughter to my son in marriage.' Right about then, a wild animal in Lebanon passed by and trampled the thorn bush. 
142Ch 25:19 You claim you've defeated Edom, but you're really only puffed up with arrogant boasting. So stay home. Why stir up trouble so you die, and the rest of Judah with you?"
142Ch 25:20 But Amaziah refused to listen, because the situation was being orchestrated by God in order to turn them over to the control of their enemies because they had pursued those Edomite gods. 
142Ch 25:21 So King Joash of Israel went out to battle against King Amaziah of Judah, and they fought at Beth-shemesh, which is part of Judah's territory. 
142Ch 25:22 Judah was defeated by Israel, and every soldier ran home. 
142Ch 25:23 King Joash of Israel captured Joash's son King Amaziah of Judah, the grandson of Ahaziah, at Beth-shemesh and brought him back to Jerusalem, where he broke down 600 feet of the wall of Jerusalem from the Ephraim Gate to the Corner Gate. 
142Ch 25:24 He confiscated all the gold, silver, and utensils that he could find in the care of Obed-Edom inside of God's temple and inside the royal palace. Then he took some hostages and returned to Samaria.
142Ch 25:25 Joash's son Amaziah, king of Judah, lived for fifteen years after the death of Jehoahaz' son Joash, king of Israel. 
142Ch 25:26 The rest of Amaziah's accomplishments, from first to last, are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel, are they not?
142Ch 25:27 From the time that Amaziah abandoned his seeking the Lord, some people conspired against him in Jerusalem, so he ran away to Lachish, but they pursued him to Lachish and killed him there. 
142Ch 25:28 They brought him back on horses and buried him with his ancestors in the city of Judah.
142Ch 26:1 All the people of Judah made Uzziah king in place of his father Amaziah. Uzziah was sixteen years old at the time. 
142Ch 26:2 He rebuilt Eloth and restored it to Judah after King Amaziah had been laid to rest with his ancestors. 
142Ch 26:3 Uzziah was sixteen years old when he became king, and he reigned for 52 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Jechiliah. She was from Jerusalem. 
142Ch 26:4 He practiced what the Lord considered to be right, following the example set by his father Amaziah's accomplishments. 
142Ch 26:5 Uzziah kept on seeking God during the lifetime of Zechariah, who taught him how to fear God, and as long as he sought the Lord, God made him prosperous.
142Ch 26:6 One time Uzziah went out and battled the Philistines. He tore down the walls of Gath, Jabneh, and Ashdod, and built cities in the Ashdod area among the Philistines. 
142Ch 26:7 God helped Uzziah defeat the Philistines, the Arabians who lived in Gur-baal, and the Meunites. 
142Ch 26:8 The Ammonites paid tribute to Uzziah, and his reputation extended as far as the border with Egypt as he became stronger and stronger. 
142Ch 26:9 Uzziah also built towers in Jerusalem, at the Corner Gate, at the Valley Gate, and at the Angle and fortified them. 
142Ch 26:10 He also built watchtowers in the wilderness and had many cisterns hewed out, since he also possessed large herds, both in the Shephelah and in the midland plains. He had many farmers and vinedressers throughout the hills and fertile lands because he loved farming.
142Ch 26:11 Uzziah kept a standing army, equipped for battle, garrisoned in divisions according to an organizational structure devised by his royal secretary Jeiel and his officer Maaseiah, who reported to Hananiah, one of the king's commanders. 
142Ch 26:12 The number of senior leaders of the ancestral houses of his elite forces numbered 2,600. 
142Ch 26:13 Uzziah commanded an army of 307,500 who could fight formidably on behalf of the king against any enemy. 
142Ch 26:14 In addition, Uzziah equipped the entire army with shields, spears, helmets, body armor, bows, and stones for use in slings. 
142Ch 26:15 He also had various siege engines built by skilled designers and placed them on the towers and on the corner ramparts that could fire arrows and very large stones. His reputation spread far and wide, and he was marvelously assisted until he grew very strong.2614
142Ch 26:16 But after he had become strong, in his arrogance he acted corruptly and became unfaithful to the Lord his God, and he dared to enter the Lord's temple to burn incense on the incense altar. 
142Ch 26:17 Azariah the priest ran after him, along with 80 of the Lord's valiant priests, 
142Ch 26:18 and they opposed King Uzziah. "Uzziah, it's not for you to burn incense to the Lord," they told him, "but for the priests to do, Aaron's descendants who are consecrated to burn incense. Leave the sanctuary now, because you have been unfaithful and won't receive any honor from the Lord God."
142Ch 26:19 Uzziah flew into a rage while he held in his hand a censer to burn incense. As he got angry at the priests, leprosy broke out all over his forehead right in front of the priests beside the incense altar in the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 26:20 So Azariah the chief priest and all the priests stared at Uzziah, who was infected with leprosy in his forehead! They all rushed at him and hurried him out of the temple. Uzziah was in a hurry to get out anyway, because the Lord had struck him.
142Ch 26:21 King Uzziah remained a leper until the day he died. Because he was a leper, he lived in a separate residence and remained disqualified to enter the Lord's temple. His son Jotham served in the royal palace, judging the people of the land. 
142Ch 26:22 Now the rest of Uzziah's accomplishments, from first to last, have been recorded by Amoz's son Isaiah the prophet. 
142Ch 26:23 Uzziah died, as had his ancestors, and they buried him alongside his ancestors in a grave in a field that belonged to the kings, because they said, "He was a leper." Uzziah's son Jotham became king to replace him.
142Ch 27:1 Jotham was 25 years old when he began his reign, and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother was Zadok's daughter Jerusha. 
142Ch 27:2 He practiced what the Lord considered to be right, just as his father Uzziah had done, even though he did not enter the temple. Nevertheless, the people continued acting corruptly.
142Ch 27:3 Jotham constructed the Upper Gate of the Lord's temple and did extensive work on the wall of Ophel. 
142Ch 27:4 He also built cities in the hill country of Judah, along with fortresses and guard towers in the forests. 
142Ch 27:5 He launched a military excursion against the king of the Ammonites and defeated him. As a result, that year the Ammonites paid 7,500 pounds of silver in tribute, as well as 60,000 bushels of wheat and 60,000 bushels of barley. The Ammonites continued to pay this same amount in tribute over the following two years. 
142Ch 27:6 Jotham grew in power because he had determined to live his life in the presence of the Lord his God. 
142Ch 27:7 The rest of the accomplishments of Jotham's reign, including all of his military exploits and campaigns, are recorded in the book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. 
142Ch 27:8 He started his reign at the age of 25 years and he reigned for sixteen years in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 27:9 Then Jotham died, as had his fathers, and he was buried in the City of David. His son Ahaz became king in his place.
142Ch 28:1 Ahaz was 20 years old when he began to reign, and he reigned 16 years in Jerusalem, but he did not practice what the Lord considered to be right, as his ancestor David had done. 
142Ch 28:2 Instead, he lived like the kings of Israel did. He cast metal images of Baal, 
142Ch 28:3 burned incense in the Ben-hinnon Valley, and burned his sons as an offering, following the detestable activities of the nations whom the Lord had expelled in front of the people of Israel. 
142Ch 28:4 He sacrificed and burned incense on high places, on the top of hills, and under every green tree.3
142Ch 28:5 As a result, the Lord his God handed Ahaz over to the king of Aram, who defeated him and took a large number of captives away to Damascus. Ahaz was also delivered over to the control of the King of Israel, who defeated him with many heavy casualties. 
142Ch 28:6 Remaliah's son Pekah killed 120,000 soldiers in a single day, all of them elite forces, because they had forsaken the Lord God of their ancestors. 
142Ch 28:7 Zichri, a valiant soldier from Ephraim, killed the king's son Maaseiah, Azrikam, the palace manager, and Elkanah, who was second in rank to the king. 
142Ch 28:8 The Israelites carried away 200,000 women, sons, and daughters from among their own relatives. They also took a great deal of plunder, and brought it all to Samaria.
142Ch 28:9 But Obed, a prophet of the Lord, went out to greet the army as it arrived in Samaria. He warned them, "Look! Because the Lord God of your ancestors was angry at Judah, he delivered them into your control, but you have killed them with a vehemence that has reached all the way to heaven! 
142Ch 28:10 Now you're intending to make the men and women of Judah and Jerusalem to be your slaves. Surely you have your own sins against the Lord your God for which you're accountable, don't you?
142Ch 28:11 So listen to me! Return the captives whom you've captured from your brothers, because the anger of the Lord is burning hot against you!"9
142Ch 28:12 Some of the leaders of the descendants of Ephraim, including Johanan's son Azariah, Meshillemoth's son Berechiah, Shallum's son Jehizkiah, and Hadlai's son Amasa, stood up to the army as they were coming back from the battle 
142Ch 28:13 and told them, "Don't bring those captives here! You'll bring even more guilt on us from the Lord, in addition to our own existing sin and guilt! He's already mad enough against Israel because of our guilt!" 
142Ch 28:14 So the army abandoned the captives and the war booty in front of the officers and the entire assembled retinue. 
142Ch 28:15 After this, some men who were chosen by name took charge of the captives, clothed those who were naked with clothes appropriated from the war booty, gave them clothes and sandals, fed them, gave them something to drink, anointed them with oil, provided those who weren't able to walk with donkeys to ride on, and took them back to their relatives at Jericho, the city of palm trees. Then they returned to Samaria.
142Ch 28:16 Right about then, King Ahaz sent for help from the kings of Assyria 
142Ch 28:17 because the Edomites had invaded, attacked Judah, and carried off some captives. 
142Ch 28:18 The Philistines also invaded some of the cities in the Shephelah and in the Negev of Judah. They captured Beth-shemesh, Aijalon, Gederoth, Soco, and their surrounding villages, Timnah and its villages, and Gimzo and its villages. Then the Philistines settled there, 
142Ch 28:19 because the Lord was humiliating Judah because of King Ahaz of Israel, since Ahaz had brought about a lack of restraint within Judah and had remained unfaithful to the Lord. 
142Ch 28:20 King Tilgath-pilneser of Assyria attacked Ahaz and, instead of helping him, attacked him. 
142Ch 28:21 Even though Ahaz took some of the assets belonging to the Lord's temple, from the royal palace, and from the palaces belonging to the princes, and gave them to the king of Assyria, none of his gifts did any good.
142Ch 28:22 In the midst of his troubles, King Ahaz became more and more unfaithful to the Lord. 
142Ch 28:23 He sacrificed to the gods of Damascus that had defeated him, reasoning, "The gods of the kings of Aram helped them, so I'll sacrifice to them so they will help me!" But those gods brought about his downfall, and the downfall of all of Israel, too. 
142Ch 28:24 Ahaz also collected the utensils of God's temple, cut them all into pieces, and closed the doors of the Lord's temple. Then he made altars to himself on every corner in Jerusalem 
142Ch 28:25 and established high places in every city of Judah where incense was burned to other gods, thus provoking the Lord God of his ancestors to anger. 
142Ch 28:26 The rest of his accomplishments, and records of everything he did from first to last are written in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
142Ch 28:27 So Ahaz died, as had his ancestors, and he was buried in the city of Jerusalem, but they didn't bury him among the tombs of the kings of Israel. Ahaz's son Hezekiah reigned in his place.2824
142Ch 29:1 Hezekiah began his reign at the age of 25. He reigned for 29 years in Jerusalem. His mother's name was Abijah, Zechariah's daughter. 
142Ch 29:2 He practiced what the Lord considered to be right, following all of the examples set by his ancestor David. 
142Ch 29:3 In the first month of the first year of his reign he repaired and reopened the doors of the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 29:4 Then he brought in the priests and Levites, gathered them into the square in the eastern part of the temple, 
142Ch 29:5 and told them, "Pay attention to me, you Levites! Consecrate yourselves and the temple of the Lord God of your ancestors by taking out from the holy place whatever is unclean. 
142Ch 29:6 Our ancestors have been unfaithful. They practiced what the Lord considers to be evil, abandoned him, turned their faces away from the place where the Lord resides, and turned their backs to him. 
142Ch 29:7 They shut the doors to the vestibule of the temple, extinguished its lamps, and have not burned incense or offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel in the holy place. 
142Ch 29:8 That's why the Lord was angry with Judah and Jerusalem and made them an object of terror, horror, and derision, as you've seen with your own eyes. 
142Ch 29:9 Now look! Our ancestors have been killed with swords and our sons, daughters, and wives are being held captivity because of all of this. 
142Ch 29:10 I'm intending to make a covenant with the Lord God of Israel so his burning anger may turn away from us. 
142Ch 29:11 Please don't be careless, you descendants of Aaron, because the Lord has chosen you to minister in his presence, to serve him, to be his ministers, and to burn incense."9
142Ch 29:12 Here are the names of the Levites who made themselves available to God£º Amasai's son Mahath and Azariah's son Joel from the descendants of the Kohathites; Abdi's son Kish and Jehallelel's son Azariah from the descendants of Merari; Zimmah's son Joah and Joah's son Eden from the Gershonites; 
142Ch 29:13 Elizaphan's sons Shimri and Jeiel; Asaph's sons Zechariah and Mattaniah; 
142Ch 29:14 Heman's sons Jehiel and Shimei; and Jeduthun's sons Shemaiah and Uzziel. 
142Ch 29:15 They also brought together their brothers, consecrated themselves, and proceeded to cleanse the Lord's temple, just as the king had ordered in accordance with what the Lord had told him. 
142Ch 29:16 The priests entered the inner courts of the Lord's temple to cleanse it, and they brought out everything unclean that they found there to the outer court of the Lord's temple. Then the Levites carried everything from there out to the Kidron Valley. 
142Ch 29:17 They began their consecration duties on the first day of the first month and finished at the Lord's outer vestibule on the eighth day of the month. Another eight days was used to consecrate the Lord's temple, so they completed the work on the sixteenth day of the first month.
142Ch 29:18 After this, they went to King Hezekiah and told him, "We have cleansed all of the Lord's temple, including the altar for burnt offerings, all of its utensils, the table of showbread, and all of its utensils. 
142Ch 29:19 In addition, we have prepared and rededicated all of the utensils that King Ahaz threw away during his unfaithful reign, and now they're back in service at the Lord's altar."
142Ch 29:20 Early the next morning, King Hezekiah got up and assembled the city officials and went up to the Lord's temple, 
142Ch 29:21 where they brought seven rams, seven lambs, and seven male goats for a sin offering on behalf of the kingdom, the holy place, and Judah. He ordered that the priests, as descendants of Aaron, place the offerings on the Lord's altar. 
142Ch 29:22 So they slaughtered the bulls and the priests sprinkled the blood on the altar. They also slaughtered the rams and sprinkled the blood on the altar, and they also slaughtered the lambs and sprinkled the blood on the altar. 
142Ch 29:23 They brought the male goats for the sin offering to the king within the assembled gathering, laid their hands on them, 
142Ch 29:24 and then the priests slaughtered them and purged the altar with their blood as a sin offering to atone for all Israel, because the king ordered that the burnt offering and the sin offering be made for all Israel.21
142Ch 29:25 Hezekiah stationed Levites in the Lord's temple to play cymbals and stringed instruments, just as David, Gad the seer, and Nathan the prophet had directed, because the command to do so was from the Lord through those prophets. 
142Ch 29:26 The Levites played instruments that had been crafted by David and the priests sounded trumpets.
142Ch 29:27 Hezekiah gave a command to offer burnt offerings on the altar, and when the burnt offerings began, a song to the Lord also began with trumpets sounding and with the instruments that King David of Israel had crafted. 
142Ch 29:28 Everybody in the assembly worshiped, the singers sang, and the trumpets sounded. They continued doing this until the burnt offering sacrifice was completed. 
142Ch 29:29 When the sacrifices had been offered, the king and everyone else who was present with him bowed down and worshiped. King Hezekiah and his officials ordered the Levites to sing praises to the Lord based on psalms that had been written by David and Asaph the seer. So they all joyfully sang praises, bowed low, and worshiped. 
142Ch 29:31 After this, Hezekiah announced, "Now that you've consecrated yourselves to the Lord, come near and bring your sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings to the Lord's temple. So the assembly brought sacrifices and thanksgiving offerings, and everyone who was willing to do so brought burnt offerings. 
142Ch 29:32 The number of burnt offerings brought by the assembly was 70 bulls, 100 rams, and 200 lambs. All of these were burnt offerings to the Lord. 
142Ch 29:33 The consecrated offerings numbered 600 bulls and 3,000 sheep. 
142Ch 29:34 Because there weren't enough priests, they were unable to prepare all the burnt offerings until other priests came forward after having consecrated themselves, so their Levite relatives assisted them until the services were complete. (The Levites had been more conscientious in consecrating themselves than had been the priests.) 
142Ch 29:35 Furthermore, there were also many burnt offerings, fat from peace offerings, and drink offerings. And that's how the service of the Lord's temple was restored. 36Hezekiah and all of the people were ecstatic with joy because of what God had done for the people, since everything had come about so suddenly.
142Ch 30:1 Hezekiah also sent word to all of Israel and Judah, and wrote letters to Ephraim and Manasseh that they should come to the Lord's temple in Jerusalem to observe the Passover to the Lord God of Israel. 
142Ch 30:2 The king, his princes, and the entire assembly in Jerusalem had mutually decided to observe the Passover in the second month, 
142Ch 30:3 but they had been unable to celebrate it then because not enough priests had consecrated themselves and the people had not yet been gathered together in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 30:4 This decision seemed to be a good one in the opinion of the king and of the entire assembly, 
142Ch 30:5 so they published a decree that was circulated throughout Israel from Beersheba to Dan that they are to come celebrate the Passover to the Lord God of Israel in Jerusalem. The Passover had not been celebrated in great numbers as was being prescribed by the decree.2
142Ch 30:6 Couriers were sent throughout all of Israel and Judah with letters written by the king and his princes, just as the king had commanded£º "Listen, you descendants of Israel! Come back to the Lord God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, so he may come back to those of you who have escaped and survived from domination by the kings of Assyria. 
142Ch 30:7 Don't be like your ancestors and your relatives, who weren't faithful to the Lord God of their ancestors, who, as a result, made them a desolate horror, as you well know. 
142Ch 30:8 So don't be stiff-necked like your ancestors were. Instead, submit to the Lord, enter his sanctuary that he has sanctified forever, and serve the Lord your God so that he'll stop being angry with you. 
142Ch 30:9 If you return to the Lord, your relatives and children will receive compassion from those who took them away captive, and they'll return to this land, because the Lord is both gracious and compassionate - he will not turn away from you if you return to him."
142Ch 30:10 Couriers crossed from city to city throughout the territories of Ephraim and Manasseh as far as Zebulun, but those people just mocked them and laughed at them. 
142Ch 30:11 Nevertheless, a few men from Asher, Manasseh, and Zebulun humbled themselves and traveled to Jerusalem. 
142Ch 30:12 God also poured out his grace throughout Judah, giving them a dedicated heart to do what the king and princes had decreed according to the word of the Lord. 
142Ch 30:13 Many of the people gathered together in Jerusalem to observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread during the second month. It was a very large assembly. 
142Ch 30:14 They all got to work and removed the idolatrous altars that were throughout Jerusalem. They also removed all the incense altars and threw them into the Kidron Brook. 
142Ch 30:15 Then they slaughtered the Passover lamb on the fourteenth day of the second month. The priests and Levites felt ashamed of themselves, so they consecrated themselves and brought burnt offerings to the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 30:16 Then they took their customary places, as the Law of Moses the man of God prescribes, and the priests sprinkled the blood that they were given by the Levites. 
142Ch 30:17 Because there were so many in the assembly that had not consecrated themselves, therefore the Levites supervised the slaughter of the Passover sacrifices on behalf of everyone who remained unclean, so they could be consecrated to the Lord. 
142Ch 30:18 Even though a large crowd of people from as far away as Ephraim, Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun had not completed consecrating themselves, they still ate the Passover in a manner not proscribed by the Law, because Hezekiah had prayed like this for them£º "May the good Lord extend a pardon on behalf of 
142Ch 30:19 everyone who prepares his own heart to seek God, the Lord God of his ancestors, even though he does so inconsistent with the laws of consecration." 
142Ch 30:20 The Lord listened to Hezekiah and healed the people.
142Ch 30:21 The Israelites who were present in Jerusalem observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with immense gladness, and the Levites and priests praised the Lord throughout each day, singing mightily to the Lord. 
142Ch 30:22 Hezekiah encouraged all the Levites who demonstrated significant insight in their service to the Lord, so they all participated in the festival meals for seven days, all the while sacrificing peace offerings and giving thanks to the Lord God of their ancestors. 
142Ch 30:23 After this, the whole assembly agreed to celebrate for another seven days, and so they did - and they were very happy to do so! 
142Ch 30:24 King Hezekiah of Judah gave the assembly 1,000 bulls and 7,000 sheep for offerings, and the princes contributed 1,000 bulls and 10,000 sheep, and a large number of priests consecrated themselves.
142Ch 30:25 Everyone in the assembly of Judah rejoiced, as did the priests, the Levites, and the people who gathered together from throughout Israel, including whose who came from the land of Israel and those who lived in Judah. 
142Ch 30:26 There was great joy throughout Jerusalem, because nothing had happened like this in Jerusalem since the days of David's son Solomon, king of Israel. 
142Ch 30:27 After this, the priests arose, blessed the people, and their voices were heard in prayer all the way to heaven, where God resides in holiness.
142Ch 31:1 At the conclusion of all of these activities, everybody in Israel who was in attendance traveled throughout the cities of Judah, broke down the sacred pillars, cut down the Asherim, and broke down the high places and altars throughout the territories of Judah, Benjamin, Ephraim, and Manasseh until they had eliminated all of them. Then the people of Israel went back to their cities and back to their work.
142Ch 31:2 Hezekiah appointed the priestly divisions and the Levite divisions, each according to their service duties, including both priests and Levites who offered morning and evening burnt offerings, peace offerings, general ministry, thanksgiving, and praise in the gateways to the Lord's campgrounds. 
142Ch 31:3 He also gave a portion of his own income for both morning and evening burnt offerings, for burnt offerings on the Sabbath, new moons, and for the scheduled festivals, as is recorded in the Lord's Law. 
142Ch 31:4 Hezekiah also directed the people who lived in Jerusalem to give what was due to the priests and Levites, so they could be strengthened in the Lord's Law. 
142Ch 31:5 As the word spread around, the people of Israel gave generously for the first fruits of grain, wine, oil, honey, and all of the produce of the fields. They generously gave a tithe of everything. 
142Ch 31:6 The descendants of Israel and Judah who lived throughout the cities of Judah also brought tithes of cattle and sheep, as well as tithes of gifts that had been dedicated to the Lord their God. As these gifts were given, they were laid in piles. 
142Ch 31:7 They began to make these piles of gifts during the third month, and it took them until the seventh month to finish. 
142Ch 31:8 When Hezekiah and the officials arrived and saw the piles of gifts, they blessed the Lord and his people Israel, 
142Ch 31:9 and Hezekiah quizzed the priests and the Levites about the piles of gifts. 
142Ch 31:10 Azariah replied, "Since they began to bring their gifts into the Lord's temple, we have eaten and have been satisfied. Now we still have plenty left, because the Lord has blessed his people so that we have all of this left over."
142Ch 31:11 Hezekiah gave an order to prepare storerooms in the Lord's temple, and so they did. 
142Ch 31:12 They faithfully brought in the gifts, tithes, and consecrated materials, and Conaniah the Levite was placed in charge of them. His brother Shimei was second in command, 
142Ch 31:13 Jehiel, Azaziah, Nathah, Asahel, Jerimoth, Jozabad, Eliel, Ismachiah, Mahath, and Benaiah served as supervisors under Conaniah and his brother Shimei, who had been appointed by King Hezekiah. Azariah served as senior officer of God's temple. 
142Ch 31:14 Imnah the Levite's son Kore, keeper of the eastern gate, was in charge of voluntary offerings to God, apportioning contributions for the Lord and the most holy things. 
142Ch 31:15 Under his authority, Eden, Miniamin, Jeshua, Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah served in the priestly cities, making sure contributions were distributed faithfully to their relatives division by division, no matter how large or how small, 
142Ch 31:16 without regard to genealogical enrollment, to every male 30 years old and older - that is, to everyone who entered the Lord's temple as their duty obligations required - for their work and duties according to their divisions 
142Ch 31:17 as well as the priests who were enrolled in the genealogies according to their ancestral households. 
142Ch 31:18 These genealogical enrollments also included all of their little children, their wives, and their sons and daughters for the entire assembly, because they were being faithful to consecrating themselves in holiness. 
142Ch 31:19 Furthermore, with respect to the descendants of Aaron, that is, the priests who lived out in the country away from the cities, or who lived in each and every city, men were designated by name to distribute portions to every male among the priests and to everyone who had been enrolled by genealogy among the Levites.
142Ch 31:20 Hezekiah did this throughout all of Judah, and he acted well, doing what the Lord his God considered to be right and true. 
142Ch 31:21 Everything that Hezekiah began in the service of God's temple was done according to the Law and to the commandments as he sought his God, worked with all of his heart, and became successful.
142Ch 32:1 After all of these acts of faithfulness occurred, King Sennacherib of Assyria came, invaded Judah, and laid siege to the fortified cities, thinking to conquer them for himself. 
142Ch 32:2 As soon as Hezekiah learned that Sennacherib had arrived and had determined to attack Jerusalem, 
142Ch 32:3 he developed a plan with his commanders and his elite forces to cut off the water supply from the springs that were outside the city, and they helped him to carry it out. 
142Ch 32:4 Many people gathered together and plugged up all the springs, along with the stream that flowed through the region. They were thinking to themselves, "Why should the Assyrian kings invade and discover a abundant water supply?"
142Ch 32:5 Hezekiah took courage and rebuilt all of the walls that had been broken down. Then he erected watch towers on them, and added another external wall. He fortified the terrace ramparts in the city of David and prepared a large number of weapons and shields. 
142Ch 32:6 He appointed military officers to take charge of the people, who gathered them together in the square near the city gate and spoke to them encouragingly, 
142Ch 32:7 "Be strong and courageous. Don't be afraid or disheartened because of the king of Assyria or because of the army that accompanies him, because the one who is with us is greater than the one with him. 
142Ch 32:8 He only has the strength of his own flesh, but the Lord our God is with us to help us and to fight our battles." So the people were encouraged from what King Hezekiah of Judah told them.6
142Ch 32:9 After this, King Sennacherib of Assyria sent his messengers to Jerusalem while he was in the middle of a vigorous attack on Lachish. They delivered this message to King Hezekiah of Judah and all the people of Judah who had gathered in Jerusalem:
142Ch 32:10 This is what King Sennacherib of Assyria says£º 'What are you leaning on that makes you stay behind while Jerusalem comes under siege?
142Ch 32:11 Isn't Hezekiah lying to you so he can hand you over to die by famine and thirst?After all, he's telling you "The Lord our God will deliver us from the king of Assyria's control?" 
142Ch 32:12 Isn't this the very same Hezekiah who removed this god's high places and altars?Isn't this the same Hezekiah who issued this order to Judah and Jerusalem£º "You are to worship in front of only one altar and burn your sacrifices only on it?" 
142Ch 32:13 Don't you know what my predecessors have done to all the other people in other lands?Were the gods of the people who lived in those lands able to deliver their countries out of my control?
142Ch 32:14 What god, out of all the gods of those nations that my predecessors utterly destroyed, has been able to deliver his people from my control or from the control of my predecessors?
142Ch 32:15 Now therefore, don't let Hezekiah lie to you or mislead you like this. Don't believe him, because no god of any nation has been able to deliver his people from my control or from the control of my predecessors. So how much less will your God deliver you from me?'"
142Ch 32:16 King Sennacherib's spokesmen said even worse things against the Lord God and against his servant Hezekiah.
142Ch 32:17 Sennacherib also wrote letters like this that insulted and slandered the Lord God of Israel£º "Just as the gods of the nations in other lands haven't delivered their people from my control, so also the god of Hezekiah won't deliver his people from me!" 
142Ch 32:18 His spokesmen shouted these things out with loud voices in the language of Judah to frighten and terrify the people of Jerusalem who were stationed on the city walls, to make it easier to conquer the city. 
142Ch 32:19 In doing so, they spoke about the God of Jerusalem as if he were like the gods of the nations of the earth that are made by the hands of human beings.
142Ch 32:20 Meanwhile, King Hezekiah and Amoz's son Isaiah the prophet were praying about this and crying out to heaven. 
142Ch 32:21 So the Lord sent an angel, who eliminated all of the elite forces, commanders, and officers within the encampment of the king of Assyria. As a result, he retreated to his own country, deeply ashamed and humiliated. When he visited the temple of his god, some of his sons killed him right there with swords. 
142Ch 32:22 That's how the Lord delivered Hezekiah, as well as those who lived in Jerusalem, from Assyria's King Sennacherib and all his forces, and provided for all of their needs. 
142Ch 32:23 Many brought gifts to the Lord in Jerusalem and brought presents to King Hezekiah of Judah. As a result, he was exalted in the opinion of all nations thereafter.3222
142Ch 32:24 During this time Hezekiah became critically ill, and he prayed to the Lord. The Lord spoke to him and gave him a sign. 
142Ch 32:25 But Hezekiah's response wasn't commensurate with what had been done for him because he was arrogant in heart, so wrath came upon him, upon Judah, and upon Jerusalem. 
142Ch 32:26 But Hezekiah humbled himself while he was arrogant in heart, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem joined him in this. As a result, the Lord's wrath did not come upon them during Hezekiah's lifetime.
142Ch 32:27 Hezekiah received immense wealth and honor. He built treasuries for himself to store silver, gold, precious stones, spices, shields, and all sorts of valuable items, 
142Ch 32:28 along with storage facilities for grain, wine, oil, stalls for all sorts of cattle and sheepfolds for his flocks. 
142Ch 32:29 He also built cities for himself and stored up flocks and herds in abundance, because God had given him great riches. 
142Ch 32:30 Hezekiah stopped up the upper outlet of the Gihon springs and diverted them down to the western side of the city of David. He prospered in everything he did.3229
142Ch 32:31 Later on, envoys came from the princes of Babylon to inquire about the miracle that had happened in the land. God left Hezekiah to himself, so that he might make known what was really in Hezekiah's heart. 
142Ch 32:32 Now the rest of Hezekiah's accomplishments and his faithful deeds are recorded in the vision of Amoz's son Isaiah the prophet, and in the Book of the Kings of Judah and Israel. 
142Ch 32:33 Hezekiah died, as did his fathers, and they buried him in the upper part of the tombs of the descendants of David. All of Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem honored him at his death. But his son Manasseh reigned in his place.
142Ch 33:1 Manasseh began to reign at the age of twelve years, and continued to reign for 55 years in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 33:2 But he practiced what the Lord considered to be evil by behaving detestably, as did the nations whom the Lord expelled in front of the Israelites.
142Ch 33:3 He re-established the high places that his father Hezekiah had demolished, he built altars to the Baals, erected Asherim, and worshiped and served the armies of heaven. 
142Ch 33:4 He also built altars in the Lord's temple, about which the Lord had spoken "My name shall reside in Jerusalem forever."
142Ch 33:5 He built altars for all the armies of heaven in the two courtyards of the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 33:6 He burned his sons as an offering in the Ben-hinnom Valley, practiced fortune-telling, witchcraft, sorcery, and communicated with mediums and separatists. He did a lot of things that the Lord considered to be evil, thus provoking him. 
142Ch 33:7 He also placed an image that he had carved in God's temple, the place about which God had told to David and to his son Solomon, "I will place my name in this temple and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel," 
142Ch 33:8 and "I won't let Israel's foothold slip on the land that I've given to your ancestors, if only they will be careful to keep everything that I commanded them in the Law, in the statutes, and in the ordinance through Moses." 
142Ch 33:9 This is how Manasseh deceived Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to practice more evil than the nations whom the Lord had eliminated in front of the Israelites.
142Ch 33:10 The Lord kept on speaking to Manasseh and to his people, but they paid no attention to him, 
142Ch 33:11 so the Lord brought in the army commanders who worked for the king of Assyria, who captured Manasseh with hooks, bound him in bronze chains, and took him off to Babylon. 
142Ch 33:12 But when he was in trouble, he sought the face of the Lord his God, humbled himself magnificently before the God of his ancestors, 
142Ch 33:13 and prayed to him. Moved by Manasseh's entreaties, the Lord heard his supplications and brought him back to his kingdom in Jerusalem. That's how Manasseh learned that the Lord is God.11
142Ch 33:14 Later on, Manasseh reinforced the outer wall to the city of David on the west side overlooking the Gihon Valley as far as the Fish Gate. He encircled the Ophel, raising it to a great height. 
142Ch 33:15 He also eliminated the foreign gods and idols from the Lord's temple, along with all of the altars that he had built in Jerusalem and on the mountain where the Lord's temple was located, and he discarded them outside the city. 
142Ch 33:16 He set up an altar to the Lord, sacrificed peace offerings on it, and ordered Judah to serve the Lord God of Israel. 
142Ch 33:17 Even so, the people continued to sacrifice in the high places, but only to the Lord their God.
142Ch 33:18 Now as to the rest of Manasseh's accomplishments, including his prayer to God and what the seers had to say to him in the name of the Lord God of Israel, they are included among the Acts of the Kings of Israel. 
142Ch 33:19 His prayer, how God was moved by him, all of his sin and unfaithfulness, and a record of the sites where he constructed high places, erected Asherim and carved images before he humbled himself are written in the Acts of the Seers. 
142Ch 33:20 So Manasseh died, as had his ancestors, and they buried him in his own palace while his son Amon became king in his place.
142Ch 33:21 Amon was 22 years old when he became king, and he reigned two years in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 33:22 He practiced what the Lord considered to be evil, just as his father Manasseh had done, sacrificing to and serving all the carved images that his father Manasseh had made, 
142Ch 33:23 except that he never humbled himself to the Lord like his father Manasseh had done. In fact, Amon multiplied his own guilt 
142Ch 33:24 until his servants finally conspired against him and executed him in his own palace. 
142Ch 33:25 But the people of the land executed all of the conspirators against King Amon and installed his son Josiah as king to succeed him.
142Ch 34:1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he reigned for 31 years in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 34:2 He practiced what the Lord considered to be right, following the example of his ancestor David, turning neither to the right nor to the left. 
142Ch 34:3 In the eighth year of his reign, while he was still young, he began to seek the God of his ancestor David. In the twelfth year of his reign, he began to remove the high places, Asherim, carved images, and cast images from Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:4 They tore down the altars of Baals in his presence. He chopped down the incense altars that stood high above them. He broke into pieces the Asherim, the carved images, and the cast images, ground them to dust, and scattered the residue on the graves of those who had sacrificed to them. 
142Ch 34:5 He burned the bones of the priests on their altars, thus purging Judah and Jerusalem. 
142Ch 34:6 In the cities of Manasseh, Ephraim, Simeon, and as far as Naphtali and their surrounding ruins, 
142Ch 34:7 he also tore down altars, destroyed the Asherim and the carved images, grinding them into dust, and chopped down all the incense altars throughout the land of Israel. Then he went back to Jerusalem.
142Ch 34:8 In the eighteenth year of his reign, after he had purged the land and the temple, he sent Azaliah's son Shaphan, Maaseiah, mayor of Jerusalem, and Joahaz son Joah, the recorder, to repair the temple of the Lord his God. 
142Ch 34:9 They approached Hilkiah the high priest and delivered to him the money that had been brought into God's temple that the Levites and gatekeepers had collected from Manasseh, Ephraim, the surviving Israelites, Judah, Benjamin, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
142Ch 34:10 They paid it to the workmen who supervised the Lord's temple, and the workmen who were employed in the Lord's temple to supervise restoration and repair of the temple. 
142Ch 34:11 They, in turn, paid the carpenters and builders to purchase quarried stone and timber for binders and beams for the buildings that previous kings of Judah had let deteriorate. 
142Ch 34:12 The workmen did their duties faithfully with these foremen supervising them£º Jahath and Obadiah, Levites who were Merari's sons, Zechariah and Meshullam, descendants of the Kohathites, and various Levites, who of whom were skilled musicians. 
142Ch 34:13 These men also supervised the heavy lift workers and supervised all the workmen from job to job, while some of the Levites served as scribes, officials, and gatekeepers.9
142Ch 34:14 While they were bringing out the money that had come in as gifts to the Lord's temple, Hilkiah the priest discovered the Book of the Law of the Lord that had been handed down by Moses. 
142Ch 34:15 Hilkiah reported his finding to Shaphan the scribe, telling him, "I found the Book of the Law in the Lord's temple. Then he gave the book to Shaphan. 
142Ch 34:16 Shaphan took the book to the king and gave an additional report to the king, telling him "Everything that you've entrusted to your servants is being carried out. 
142Ch 34:17 They've removed the money that was found in the Lord's temple and have passed it on to the supervisors and the workmen." 
142Ch 34:18 Shaphan the scribe also informed the king, "Hilkiah the priest gave me a book." Shaphan read from its contents to the king.
142Ch 34:19 As soon as he heard what the Law said, he tore his clothes. 
142Ch 34:20 He issued these orders to Hilkiah, Shaphan's son Ahikam, Micah's son Abdon, Shaphan the scribe, and the king's personal assistant Asaiah£º 
142Ch 34:21 "Go ask the Lord for me and for those who survive in Israel and in Judah about the words that we've read in this book that we found, because the wrath of the Lord that we deserve to have poured out on us is very great, since our ancestors haven't obeyed the word of the Lord that required us to do everything that is written in this book."
142Ch 34:22 So Hilkiah and the others who had received orders from the king went to visit Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Tokhath's son Shallum, grandson of Hasrah. She was the king's wardrobe supervisor, and she lived in Jerusalem's Second Quarter. They asked her about what had happened. 
142Ch 34:23 In response, she replied£º "This is what the Lord God of Israel says£º 'Tell the man who sent you to me, 
142Ch 34:24 "This is what the Lord says£º 'Pay attention! I'm bringing evil to visit this place and its inhabitants - every single curse written in the book that they've been reading to the King of Judah. 
142Ch 34:25 Because they abandoned me and have burned incense to other gods, provoking me to become angry at everything they're doing, therefore my wrath is about to be poured out on this place, and it won't be quenched.'"'
142Ch 34:26 "Now tell the king of Judah who sent you to ask the Lord about this£º 'This is what the Lord God of Israel says about what you've heard£º 
142Ch 34:27 "Because your heart was sensitive, and you humbled yourself before God when you heard what he had to say about this place and its inhabitants - indeed, because you humbled yourself before me, tore your clothes, and cried out to me, I have heard you," declares the Lord. 
142Ch 34:28 "Look! I'm going to take you to your ancestors, and you will be buried in your grave in peace so that you won't have to see all the evil that I'm going to bring to his place and to its inhabitants."'" So they all brought back this message to the king.
142Ch 34:29 The king sent word to gather all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem. 
142Ch 34:30 Then the king went up to the Lord's temple, accompanied by the men of Judah, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the priests and Levites, and everyone else from the most important to the least important, and he read out loud all the words of the book of the covenant that had been found in the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 34:31 While standing in his appointed place, the king made a public covenant with the Lord to follow the Lord, to keep his commandments, his testimonies, and his statutes, and to do so with all of his heart and soul, and to carry out what was written in the covenant contained in the book. 
142Ch 34:32 He also made everyone who was present in Jerusalem and Benjamin to stand in agreement with him. As a result, the inhabitants of Jerusalem reconfirmed the covenant of God, the God of their ancestors. 
142Ch 34:33 Josiah also removed all the detestable things from the territories that belonged to the people of Israel, and made everyone who lived in Israel to serve the Lord their God. For the rest of his life, they didn't abandon their quest to follow the Lord God of their ancestors.3431
142Ch 35:1 Josiah observed the Passover to the Lord in Jerusalem. They slaughtered the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month. 
142Ch 35:2 He appointed priests to their offices, encouraging them in their service at the Lord's temple. 
142Ch 35:3 He addressed the Levites who were teaching all Israel and who had consecrated themselves to the Lord, telling them£º "Put the holy ark in the temple that Solomon, the son of Israel's King David, built. It will no longer be a burden on their shoulders. Now go serve the Lord your God and his people Israel. 
142Ch 35:4 Prepare yourselves by divisions according to your ancestral households, keeping to what King David of Israel and his son Solomon wrote about this. 
142Ch 35:5 In addition to this, take your place in the holy place according to the groupings of the ancestral households of your relatives consistent with the division of the Levites by their ancestral households. 
142Ch 35:6 Now slaughter the Passover, consecrate yourselves, and prepare your relatives to obey the word of the Lord given by Moses"
142Ch 35:7 Josiah contributed 30,000 animals from the flocks of lambs and young goats, giving Passover offerings to all of the people who were present, plus an additional 3,000 bulls from the king's private possessions. 
142Ch 35:8 His officers contributed a voluntary offering to the people, the priests, and the Levites. Hilkiah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, the officials who supervised God's temple, gave 2,600 animals from their flocks to the priests for Passover offerings, along with 300 bulls. 
142Ch 35:9 Also, Conaniah, and his relatives Shemaiah, and Nethanel, along with Hashabiah, Jeiel, and Jozabad, the officers in charge of the Levites, contributed 5,000 animals from the flocks to the Levites for the Passover offerings, along with 500 bulls. 
142Ch 35:10 As a result, the Passover service was prepared, the priests took their assigned places, and the Levites stood in their divisions as the king had commanded.
142Ch 35:11 They slaughtered the Passover lamb, and the priests poured out the blood that they had received from the lambs while the Levites flayed the sacrifices. 
142Ch 35:12 They set aside in reserve the burnt offerings, so they could distribute them in proportion to the divisions of their ancestral households for presentation by the people to the Lord, as is required by the book of Moses. They did this with respect to the bulls, also. 
142Ch 35:13 They roasted the Passover in fire, as required by the ordinances, and boiled the holy things in pots, kettles, and pans, and delivered them quickly to all the people. 
142Ch 35:14 After this, because the priests, who were descendants of Aaron, were busy offering the burnt offerings and fat portions until evening, the Levites prepared the Passover for themselves and their fellow-descendants of Aaron, the priests. 
142Ch 35:15 The singers, as descendants of Asaph, remained at their stations as David, Asaph, Heman, and the king's seer Jeduthun required, and the gatekeepers did not have to leave their posts because their Levite relatives prepared the Passover for them.
142Ch 35:16 That's how the Lord's service was prepared that day to celebrate the Passover and to offer burnt offerings on the Lord's altar according to what King Josiah had commanded. 
142Ch 35:17 The Israelites who were present celebrated the Passover that day, as well as the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days. 
142Ch 35:18 There had not been a Passover celebration like it in Israel since Samuel the prophet was alive, nor had any of the kings of Israel celebrated a Passover like Josiah did at that time with the priests, the Levites, everyone from Judah and Israel who were present, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem. 
142Ch 35:19 This Passover celebration was observed during the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah.
142Ch 35:20 Some time after all of this, after Josiah had finished preparing the temple, King Neco of Egypt invaded Carchemish on the Euphrates River, and Josiah went out to fight him. 
142Ch 35:21 But he sent messengers to him, who asked him, "What do we have in common, King of Judah?I am not here today opposing you. I am fighting the dynasty that is fighting me, and God has ordered me to hurry. For your own good, stop interfering with God, who is with me, and he won't destroy you!"3520
142Ch 35:22 But Josiah wouldn't turn around. In fact, he put on a disguise so he could fight Neco. He wouldn't listen to what God told him through what Neco had to say, and as a result, Josiah came to attack Neco on the Megiddo plain. 
142Ch 35:23 Some archers shot King Josiah, and the king told his servants, "Take me away, because I'm badly wounded." 
142Ch 35:24 So his servants removed him from the chariot he was in and carried him away in a backup chariot that he had and took him back to Jerusalem, where he died and was buried in the tombs of his ancestors. All of Judah and Jerusalem went into mourning for Josiah.
142Ch 35:25 Jeremiah sang a lament for Josiah, and all the male and female singers recite that lamentation about Josiah to this day. In fact, they made singing it an ordinance in Israel, and they are recorded in the Lamentations. 
142Ch 35:26 Now the rest of the accomplishments of Josiah, including his faithful acts of devotion as required in the Law of the Lord, 
142Ch 35:27 and his other activities from first to last, are recorded in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah.
142Ch 36:1 After this, the people of the land installed Josiah's son Jehoahaz in Jerusalem as king to take his father's place. 
142Ch 36:2 Joahaz was 23 years old when he became king, and he reigned for three months in Jerusalem, 
142Ch 36:3 after which the king of Egypt dethroned him and imposed a fine on the land of 7,500 pounds of silver and 75 pounds of gold. 
142Ch 36:4 King Neco of Egypt installed Jehoahaz's brother Eliakim as king over Judah and Jerusalem, changed Eliakim's name to Jehoiakim, and took his brother Joahaz back to Egypt.
142Ch 36:5 Jehoiakim was 25 years old when he became king, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem, but he practiced what the Lord his God considered to be evil. 
142Ch 36:6 As a result, King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon attacked him, bound him in bronze shackles, and took him to Babylon. 
142Ch 36:7 Nebuchadnezzar also took articles from the Lord's temple to Babylon and placed them in his temple in Babylon. 
142Ch 36:8 The rest of Jehoiakim's accomplishments - along with the detestable things that he did that were recorded in his disfavor - are written in the Book of the Kings of Israel and Judah. His son Jehoiachin became king to replace him.
142Ch 36:9 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he became king, and he reigned for three months and ten days in Jerusalem, all the while doing what the Lord considered to be evil. 
142Ch 36:10 At the beginning of the next year, King Nebuchadnezzar sent for him and brought him to Babylon, along with valuable articles from the Lord's temple, and he installed Jehoiachin's relative Zedekiah as king over Judah and Jerusalem.
142Ch 36:11 Zedekiah was 21 years old when he became king, and he reigned for eleven years in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 36:12 He practiced what the Lord his God considered to be evil and never humbled himself before Jeremiah the prophet who spoke for the Lord. 
142Ch 36:13 Zedekiah rebelled against King Nebuchadnezzar, who had made him swear allegiance in the name of God. Instead, he stiffened his resolve, and hardened his heart, and would not return to the Lord God of Israel.
142Ch 36:14 Meanwhile, all the officials who supervised the priests and the people remained unfaithful, following the detestable example of the surrounding nations. They polluted the Lord's temple that he had consecrated in Jerusalem. 
142Ch 36:15 The Lord God of their ancestors pleaded with them time and again through his messengers, because he had compassion on his people and on the place of his residence, 
142Ch 36:16 but they mocked God's messengers, despised his words, and scoffed at his prophets, until there was no remedy for the wrath of the Lord that arose to punish his people. 
142Ch 36:17 Therefore he brought up the king of the Chaldeans against them, who executed their young men in the holy temple, showing no compassion on young man or young virgin, adult men or the aged. God gave them all into the king's control, 
142Ch 36:18 who took back to Babylon every article in God's temple, whether large or small, including the treasuries of the Lord's temple, the king's assets, and those of his officers. 
142Ch 36:19 After this, they set fire to God's temple, demolished the wall around Jerusalem, burned all of its fortified buildings, and destroyed everything of value. 
142Ch 36:20 Nebuchadnezzar carried off to Babylon those who survived the executions, and they served him and his descendants until the kingdom of Persia came to power. 
142Ch 36:21 All of this fulfilled what the Lord had predicted through Jeremiah. And so the land enjoyed its Sabbaths, and the length of the land's desolation lasted until a 70-year long Sabbath had been completed.19
142Ch 36:22 During the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, in fulfillment of the word of the Lord spoken by Jeremiah, the Lord prompted Cyrus, king of Persia, to make this proclamation throughout his entire kingdom, which was also released in written form:
142Ch 36:23 An Official Statement from Cyrus, King of Persia All of the kingdoms of the earth have been given to me by the Lord God of Heaven, and he specifically charged me to build a temple for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Therefore, who among the Lord's people trusts in his God?Whoever among this group wishes to do so may travel to Jerusalem.
15
15Ezr 1:1 During the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, in fulfillment of the word of the Lord spoken through Jeremiah, the Lord prompted Cyrus, king of Persia, to make this proclamation throughout his entire kingdom, which was also released in written form:
15Ezr 1:2 An Official Statement from Cyrus, King of Persia All of the kingdoms of the earth have been given to me by the Lord God of Heaven, and he specifically charged me to build a temple for him in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. 
15Ezr 1:3 Therefore, who among the Lord's people trusts in his God?Whoever among this group wishes to do so may travel to Jerusalem of Judah to rebuild the temple of the Lord God of Israel, the God of Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 1:4 Furthermore, everyone who wishes to repatriate from any territory where he now resides shall receive assistance from his fellow residents in the form of silver, gold, equipment, and pack animals, in addition to voluntary offerings for the temple of the God of Jerusalem.
15Ezr 1:5 In response, the heads of the families of Judah and Benjamin, the priests and Levites, and all those who had been prompted by God, prepared to travel to rebuild the temple of the Lord, which was in Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 1:6 So all of their neighbors equipped the travelers with silver, gold, equipment, pack animals, and valuable goods, in addition to voluntary offerings.1
15Ezr 1:7 King Cyrus also brought out from storage the service instruments from the temple of the Lord, which Nebuchadnezzar had taken from Jerusalem and had placed in the temple of his gods. 
15Ezr 1:8 Cyrus, king of Persia, had them brought out to Methredath the Treasurer, had them inventoried, and had them placed in care of Sheshbazzar, governor of Judah. 
15Ezr 1:9 Here is a partial inventory£º Gold dishes£º 30 Silver dishes£º 1,000 Sacrificial knives£º 29
15Ezr 1:10 Gold bowls£º 30 Silver bowls of another kind£º 410 Miscellaneous instruments£º 1,000
15Ezr 1:11 The complete inventory of gold and silver vessels totaled 5,400. Sheshbazzar brought them all to Jerusalem, along with the exiles from Babylon.1
15Ezr 2:1 Here is a list of descendants of the province of Judah who returned from the captivity, from those who had been exiled. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, had taken them to Babylon. They came back to Jerusalem and Judah, each one to his town,

15Ezr 2:61 Descendants of the Priests£º Descendants of Habaiah, Hakkoz, and Barzillai, who married one of the daughters of Barzillai from Gilead and took that name.
15Ezr 2:62 These people searched for their ancestral registrations but they couldn't be located. Accordingly, they were assigned an "unclean" status and couldn't be priests. 
15Ezr 2:63 Governor Zerubbabel also ruled that they shouldn't eat anything holy until a priest arose with Urim and Thummim.
15Ezr 2:64 The entire assembly numbered 42,360, 
15Ezr 2:65 not including 7,337 male and female servants, along with 200 singing men and women. 
15Ezr 2:66 In addition, they had 736 horses, 245 mules, 
15Ezr 2:67 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.2
15Ezr 2:68 When they arrived at the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem, some of the heads of the families contributed toward building the temple of God on its former site. 
15Ezr 2:69 They contributed to the treasury for this work in accordance with their ability£º 61,000 golden drachma, 5,000 units of silver, and 100 priestly robes. 
15Ezr 2:70 As a result, the priests, Levites, certain people, the singers, door-keepers, and the temple Servants were able to settle in their original cities, with the rest of the Israelites in their cities.
15Ezr 3:1 Seven months after the Israelites had settled in their cities, they all gathered together in Jerusalem as a united body. 
15Ezr 3:2 Then Jozadak's son Jeshua and his brothers got up, along with Shealtiel's son Zerubabbel and his brothers. They built an altar of the God of Israel in order to offer burnt offerings, as prescribed by the Law of Moses, the man of God.
15Ezr 3:3 Even though they feared the people in neighboring regions, they rebuilt the altar where it had stood before. They offered burnt offerings on it to the Lord - burnt offerings both in the morning and in the evening. 
15Ezr 3:4 They also observed the Festival of Tabernacles as has been prescribed, offering a specific number of daily burnt offerings in accordance with the ordinance of each day. 
15Ezr 3:5 After that, they offered all of the continual burnt offerings and the new moon sacrifices for all of the designated festivals of the Lord that were being consecrated, along with all the voluntary offerings that were dedicated to the Lord. 
15Ezr 3:6 They began to offer burnt offerings to the Lord from the first day of the seventh month, even though the foundation of the temple of the Lord had not yet been laid.33
15Ezr 3:7 They paid masons and carpenters in cash. They paid the residents of Sidon and Tyre with food, drink, and oil, for them to bring cedar trees by sea from Lebanon to Joppa in accordance with the order they had obtained from Cyrus, king of Persia.
15Ezr 3:8 Two years and two months after arriving at the site of the temple of God in Jerusalem, Shealtiel's son Zerubabbel, Jozadak's son Jeshua, the relatives of the priests and Levites, and everyone else who had left the Babylonian captivity for Jerusalem appointed Levites who were 20 years old and older to oversee the work of the Lord'st emple.
15Ezr 3:9 At this time Jeshua, along with his children and relatives, and Kadmiel, with his children and the descendants of Judah, joined the family of Henadad with his children and relatives, and the Levites in overseeing the work on the temple of God.
15Ezr 3:10 After the builders laid the foundation for the Lord's temple, the priests stood in their ministerial robes with trumpets and the Levite descendants of Asaph with cymbals to praise the Lord, according to instructions prepared by David, king of Israel. 
15Ezr 3:11 And they sang in unison to one another, giving thanks to the Lord£º "He is good, and his gracious love to Israel endures forever." And all the people shouted out loudly in praise to the Lord when the foundation of the Lord's temple was laid.3
15Ezr 3:12 Now a number of the priests, the Levities, and the leading officials of the elders - who were really old - had seen the former temple with their own eyes. When they observed the foundation of the temple being laid, they wept with a loud voice, while the rest of them shouted for joy. 
15Ezr 3:13 As a result, the people couldn't distinguish between the noise coming from the shouts of joy and the noise coming from the weeping people, because everyone was shouting loudly and could be heard a long way off.312
15Ezr 4:1 When the enemies of Judah and Benjamin learned that the descendants of the Babylonian captivity had built their temple to the Lord, the God of Israel, 
15Ezr 4:2 they approached Zerubbabel and the heads of the families with this message£º "Let's build along with you, because, like you, we seek your God, as do you, and we've been making sacrifices to him since the reign of Esarhaddon, king of Assyria, who brought us here."
15Ezr 4:3 But Zerubabbel, Jeshua, and the rest of the heads of the families of Israel replied, "You have no part in our plans for building a temple to our God, because we alone will build to the Lord, the God of Israel, in accordance with the decree issued by King Cyrus, king of Persia."
15Ezr 4:4 After this, the non-Israelite inhabitants of the land undermined the people of Judah, harassing them in their construction work 
15Ezr 4:5 by bribing their consultants in order to frustrate their plans throughout the reign of Cyrus, king of Persia until Darius became king.
15Ezr 4:6 At the beginning of the reign of Ahasuerus, they lodged a formal accusation against the inhabitants of Judah and Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 4:7 While Artaxerxes was king of Persia, Bishlam, Mithredath, Tabeel, and the rest of their co-conspirators wrote in the Aramaic language and script to King Artaxerxes of Persia. Aramaic£º 
15Ezr 4:8 Governor Rehum and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter concerning Jerusalem to King Artaxerxes as follows:
15Ezr 4:9  From Governor Rehum Shimshai the scribe The rest of their colleagues - Judges, envoys, officials, Persians, the people of Erech, the Babylonians, the people of Susa(that is, the Elamites)
15Ezr 4:10 and many other nations whom the great and honorable Osnappar deported and resettled in Samaria and in the rest of the province beyond the Euphrates River.
15Ezr 4:11 This is the text of the letter they sent. To£º King Artaxerxes From£º Your servants, the men of the province beyond the Euphrates River.
15Ezr 4:12 May the king be advised that the Jews who came from you to us have reached Jerusalem and are rebuilding a rebellious and wicked city, having completed its walls and repaired its foundations.
15Ezr 4:13 May the king be further advised that if this city is rebuilt and its walls erected, its citizens will refuse to pay tributes, taxes, and tariffs, thereby restricting royal revenues.
15Ezr 4:14 Now, because we are royal employees and are committed to preserving the reputation of the king, we have written to the king and have declared its contents to be true, 
15Ezr 4:15 urging that a search may be made in the official registers of your predecessors. You will discover in the registers that this city is a rebellious city, that it is damaging to both kings and provinces, that it has been moved to sedition from time immemorial, and that because of this it was destroyed.
15Ezr 4:16 We certify to the king that if this city is rebuilt and its walls completed, you will lose your land holdings in the province beyond the Euphrates River.
15Ezr 4:17 The king replied£º To£º Governor Rehum, Shimshai the scribe, and their colleagues living in Samaria, and the remainder living beyond the Euphrates River. Greetings:
15Ezr 4:18 The memorandum you sent to us has been read and carefully considered. 
15Ezr 4:19 Pursuant to my edict, an investigation has been undertaken.               It is noted that this city has fomented rebellion against kings from time immemorial, and that rebellion and sedition has occurred in it. 
15Ezr 4:20 Powerful kings have reigned over Jerusalem, including ruling over all lands beyond the Euphrates River. Furthermore, taxes, tribute, and tolls have been paid to them.4
15Ezr 4:21 Accordingly, issue an order to force these men to cease their work so that this city is not rebuilt until you receive further notice from me.4
15Ezr 4:22 Be diligent and take precautions so that you do not neglect your responsibility in this matter. Why should the kingdom sustain any more damage - 
15Ezr 4:23 As soon as a copy of the letter from King Artaxerxes was read to Rehum, to Shimshai the scribe, and to their colleagues, they traveled quickly to Jerusalem and compelled the Jews to cease by force of arms. 
15Ezr 4:24 As a result, work on the temple of God in Jerusalem ceased and did not begin again until the second year of the reign of King Darius of Persia.
15Ezr 5:1 At that time, the prophets Haggai and Iddo's son Zechariah prophesied specifically to the Jews in Judah and Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel. 
15Ezr 5:2 So Shealtiel's son Zerubabbel and Jozadak's son Jeshua restarted construction of the temple of God in Jerusalem. And the prophets of God were there supporting them.
15Ezr 5:3 Right about then, Trans-Euphrates Governor Tattenai, Shethar-bozenai, and their colleagues approached and challenged them. They asked, "Who authorized you to build this temple and to reconstruct this wall?" 
15Ezr 5:4 In answer, we responded with a list of the names of the men who were building the structure. 
15Ezr 5:5 But God watched over the Jewish leaders, who could not be forced to stop working until Darius received a report and responded in reply.
15Ezr 5:6 Here is a copy of the letter that Trans-Euphrates Governor Tattenai, Shethar-boznai, and his colleagues the Trans-Euphrates Persians sent to King Darius. 
15Ezr 5:7 The letter sent to him was written like this£º To£º King Darius£º Greetings!
15Ezr 5:8 This is to inform the king that we traveled to the temple of the great God in the Judean province, which is being built with large stones and reinforced with wooden beams in its walls. The work proceeds diligently and is in capable hands.
15Ezr 5:9 We asked the elders, "Who authorized you to build this temple and to reinforce these walls?" 
15Ezr 5:10 We also asked them their names so that we could certify the identities of their leaders to you.
15Ezr 5:11 In answer they responded, "We are servants of the God of heaven and earth, and are rebuilding the temple that was built many years ago by a great king of Israel. 
15Ezr 5:12 But because our predecessors provoked the God of Heaven to become angry, he handed them over to the control of King Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, the Chaldean who destroyed this temple and transported the people to Babylon.
15Ezr 5:13 However, during King Cyrus' first year - that same King Cyrus of Babylon - issued a decree to reconstruct this temple of God. 
15Ezr 5:14 He delivered into the care of Sheshbazzar (whom he appointed governor) the gold and silver utensils that Nebuchadnezzar had taken from the Jerusalem temple and brought into the Babylonian temple.
15Ezr 5:15 "And Cyrus told him, 'Take these utensils, go to Jerusalem, and carry them to the temple, after the temple of God has been built in its appropriate place.'5
15Ezr 5:16 "Then this very same Sheshbazzar arrived and laid the foundations for the temple of God in Jerusalem. Since that time until now the temple has been under construction and is not yet completed."5
15Ezr 5:17 Accordingly, with your approval we suggest that a search be conducted within the king's treasury at Babylon to verify whether or not King Cyrus ever issued such a decree to reconstruct this temple of God in Jerusalem. Then please notify us concerning the king's pleasure in this matter.
15Ezr 6:1 Then King Darius issued an order to search the Hall of Records where the Babylonian archives were stored. 
15Ezr 6:2 The following was found written on a scroll in Ecbatana at the summer palace of the province of Media:
15Ezr 6:3 Date£º First year of Cyrus the King From£º King Cyrus Subject£º The temple of God in Jerusalem Let the temple be rebuilt where they offered sacrifices. Let the foundations thereof be laid with a height of ninety feet and a width of ninety feet, 
15Ezr 6:4 constructed with three layers of foundation stone interlaced with a row of new timber, the expenses for which shall be paid from the king's treasury.
15Ezr 6:5 Furthermore, let the gold and silver utensils from the temple of God (that Nebuchadnezzar took from the temple in Jerusalem and carried off to Babylon) be brought back to the temple at Jerusalem and restored to their respective places in the temple of God.
15Ezr 6:6 To£º Tattenai, Trans-Euphrates Governor, Shethar-boznai, and your colleagues living beyond the Euphrates River. Stay away from there!
15Ezr 6:7 Leave the work on this temple of God alone! Let the Jewish governor and the Jewish leaders build this temple of God on its site.
15Ezr 6:8 Furthermore, I hereby decree what you are to do for the Jewish leaders who are building this temple of God£º you are to pay the expenses of these men out of the king's assets from taxes collected beyond the River so that they are not hindered.
15Ezr 6:9 And be sure that you don't fail to provide their daily needs - including young bulls, rams, and lambs for the burnt offerings of the God of Heaven, along with wheat, salt, wine, and oil, as the priests in Jerusalem tell you?
15Ezr 6:10 so they may approach the God of Heaven with fragrant sacrifices and pray for the life of this king and his sons.
15Ezr 6:11 I hereby also decree that whoever shall alter the wording of this edict, let his residence be torn down for timber to build a gallows, hang him on it, and turn his home into an outhouse. 
15Ezr 6:12 And may the God who causes his Name to rest there destroy any king or people who might attempt to destroy this temple of God in Jerusalem. I, Darius, have issued this decree. Let it be carried out quickly.
15Ezr 6:13 Because of what King Darius had mandated, Tattenai, the Trans-Euphrates Governor, Shethar-boznai, and their colleagues carried out his orders quickly.
15Ezr 6:14 And so the Jewish leaders continued their building, and prospered because of the prophecies of Haggai the prophet and Iddo's son Zechariah. They completed the rebuilding in accordance with the commandment from the God of Israel and the edicts of Cyrus, Darius, and Artaxerxes, king of Persia. 
15Ezr 6:15 The temple was completed on the third day of the month Adar during the sixth year of the reign of King Darius.6
15Ezr 6:16 The Israelites - the priests, the Levites, and the other related descendants who had returned from captivity - celebrated with joy at the dedication of the temple of God. 
15Ezr 6:17 At the dedication offering of the temple of God, they presented 100 bulls, 200 rams, and 400 lambs, along with a sin offering of twelve male goats for the entire nation of Israel according to the number of the tribes of Israel.
15Ezr 6:18 Furthermore, they established the priests in their divisions and the Levites in their positions for the service of God conducted at Jerusalem, as is proscribed in the Book of Moses.
15Ezr 6:19 The former exiles observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month 
15Ezr 6:20 because the priests and Levites had purified themselves together - all of them were pure - and they killed the Passover lamb for every former exile, for their relatives the priests, and for themselves.
15Ezr 6:21 So the Israelites who had returned from captivity ate the Passover with all who had consecrated themselves from the uncleanness of the nations of the land in order to seek the Lord God of Israel. 
15Ezr 6:22 Then they observed the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days with joy, because the Lord had made them glad, turning the heart of the king of Assyria toward them and strengthening them for their work on the temple of God, the God of Israel.
15Ezr 7:1 After all of this, during the reign of King Artaxerxes of Persia, Seraiah's son Ezra (who was the grandson of Azariah, son of Hilkiah, 
15Ezr 7:2 son of Shallum, son of Zadok, son of Ahitub, 
15Ezr 7:3 son of Amariah, son of Azariah, son of Meraioth, 
15Ezr 7:4 son of Zerahiah, son of Uzzi, son of Bukki, 
15Ezr 7:5 son of Abishua, son of Phinehas, son of Eleazar, son of Aaron the chief priest) 
15Ezr 7:6 left Babylon. He was a skillful scribe of the Law of Moses that the Lord God of Israel had given. And the king granted him everything he had requested because the hand of the Lord his God was upon him. 
15Ezr 7:7 Some of the descendants of Israel also left for Jerusalem, including the priests, the Levites, the singers, the gatekeepers, and the temple Servants, during the seventh year of king Artaxerxes.
15Ezr 7:8 He arrived in Jerusalem during the fifth month of the seventh year of the king's reign. 
15Ezr 7:9 On the first day of the first month he left Babylon and he arrived in Jerusalem on the first day of the fifth month, since the beneficent hand of his God was upon him. 
15Ezr 7:10 For Ezra had set his heart to seek the Law of the Lord, to obey it, and to teach God's statutes and judgments in Israel.9
15Ezr 7:11 Here is a copy of the letter that King Artaxerxes gave to Ezra, the priest-scribe, a scholar in matters concerning the commandments of the Lord and concerning his statutes pertaining to Israel:
15Ezr 7:12 From£º Artaxerxes, King of Kings To£º Ezra, the Priest, a scholar in matters concerning the laws of the God of Heaven Greetings!
15Ezr 7:13 I hereby decree that all of the people of Israel?along with their priests and Levites in my kingdom - who are determined to return to Jerusalem with you may do so. 
15Ezr 7:14 You have authority to act for the king and for his Council of Seven to conduct an inquiry concerning Judah and Jerusalem in accordance with the Law of your God, which is in your possession. 
15Ezr 7:15 You are carrying silver and gold that the King and his advisors have freely given to the God of Israel, whose temple is in Jerusalem, 
15Ezr 7:16 together with all of the silver and gold that you can raise in the province of Babylon, plus the freewill offerings given by the people and the priests, contributed for the temple of their God, which is in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 7:17 Accordingly, you are to exercise due diligence to utilize this money to purchase bulls, rams, lambs, grain offerings, and drink offerings, and to offer them upon the altar of the temple of your God, which is in Jerusalem.
15Ezr 7:18 Furthermore, the balance remaining of the silver and gold may be used for whatever other purpose you and your people desire, as long as such use is consistent with the will of your God.
15Ezr 7:19 Furthermore, you are to deliver to the God of Jerusalem the vessels for the service of the temple of your God that have been given to you.
15Ezr 7:20 Furthermore, provide from the royal treasury whatever else may be needed for the temple of your God.
15Ezr 7:21 I, Artaxerxes, in my capacity as king, hereby decree to all royal treasuries beyond the Euphrates River that whatever Ezra the priest-scribe of the Law of the God of Heaven, may require of you are to be performed with all due diligence, 
15Ezr 7:22 up to 100 silver talents, 100 measures of wheat, 100 measures of wine, 100 measures of oil, and salt without limitation. 
15Ezr 7:23 Whatever is commanded by the God of Heaven is to be done with all due diligence for the temple of the God of Heaven, or wrath will come against the king's realm and his sons.
15Ezr 7:24 Furthermore, we decree that with respect to any of the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple Servants, or other servants of this temple of God, it is not to be lawful to impose any tribute, tax, or toll on them.
15Ezr 7:25 And you, Ezra, in accordance with the wisdom given to you by your God, shall appoint magistrates and judges to administer justice to all the people beyond the Euphrates River. All of them are to know the laws of your God, and you are to instruct those who do not know them. 
15Ezr 7:26 Whoever refuses to practice the law of your God and the law of the king shall see judgment executed quickly, whether to death, banishment, confiscation of goods, or imprisonment.
15Ezr 7:27 Blessed be the Lord God of our ancestors, who placed this decree into the king's heart to beautify the temple of the Lord in Jerusalem
15Ezr 7:28 and who showed gracious love to me before the king, before his advisors, and before all of the king's mighty officials. And I was strengthened because the hand of the Lord my God was upon me. So I gathered together the leaders of Israel to go with me.
15Ezr 8:1 These are the leaders of the families listed among those who left Babylon with me during the reign of King Artaxerxes£º 
15Ezr 8:2 From Phinehas's descendants£º Gershom. From Ithamar's descendants£º Daniel. From David's descendants£º Hattush. 
15Ezr 8:3 From Shecaniah's descendants and from Parosh's descendants£º Zechariah, along with 150 men whose genealogies had been certified. 
15Ezr 8:4 From Pahath-moab's descendants£º Zerahiah's son Eliehoenai and 200 men with him. 
15Ezr 8:5 From Zattu's descendants£º Jahaziel's son Shecaniah and 300 men with him. 
15Ezr 8:6 From Adin's descendants£º Jonathan's son Ebed and 50 men with him. 
15Ezr 8:7 From Elam's descendants£º Athaliah's son Jeshaiah and 70 men with him. 
15Ezr 8:8 From Shephatiah's descendants£º Michael's son Zebadiah and 80 men with him. 
15Ezr 8:9 From Joab's descendants£º Jehiel's son Obadiah and 218 men with him. 
15Ezr 8:10 From Bani's descendants£º Josiphaiah's son Shelomith and 160 men with him. 
15Ezr 8:11 From Bebai's descendants£º Bebai's son Zechariah and 28 men with him. 
15Ezr 8:12 From Azgad's descendants£º Hakkatan's son Johanan and 110 men with him. 
15Ezr 8:13 From Adonikam's later descendants£º Eliphelet, Jeuel, Shemaih, and 60 men with him. 
15Ezr 8:14 From Bigvai's descendants£º Uthai, Zabbud, and 70 men with him.8
15Ezr 8:15 I gathered them together at the river that flows toward Ahava, where we camped three days. Afterwards, I examined the people and the priests, but found no descendants of Levi there. 
15Ezr 8:16 So I sent for Eliezer, Ariel, Shemaiah, Elnathan, Jarib, Elnathan, Nathan, Zechariah, and Meshullam, who were senior leaders, as well as for Joiarib and Elnathan, who were men of discernment. 
15Ezr 8:17 I told them to go see Iddo, a leader of Casiphia, and tell him and his relatives (administrators of Casiphia) to bring us men who could serve in the temple of our God. 
15Ezr 8:18 By the grace of our God they brought back a discerning man from the descendants of Mahli, a descendant of Israel's son Levi, along with Sherebiah and eighteen of his sons and brothers; 
15Ezr 8:19 Hashabiah and Jeshaiah from the descendants of Merari and 
15Ezr 8:20 of his brothers and their sons; 20220 descendants of the temple Servants whom David and the leaders had appointed to serve the Levites, listed by name.
15Ezr 8:21 Then I called for a fast there at the Ahava River so we could humble ourselves before our God and seek from him an appropriate way for us and our little ones to live, and how we should guard our personal wealth, 
15Ezr 8:22 because I was ashamed to ask the king for a contingent of soldiers and cavalry to protect us from enemies we might encounter on the way. After all, we had told the king, "The hand of our God seeks the good of all who seek him, but his power and anger are against everyone who forsakes him." 
15Ezr 8:23 So we fasted and asked our God about this, and he listened to us.
15Ezr 8:24 Next I selected twelve of the chief priests - Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brothers with them?
15Ezr 8:25 and divided between them the silver, the gold, the vessels, and the offering for the temple of our God which the king had offered, along with his advisors, his senior officials, and all of Israel assembled there. 
15Ezr 8:26 I divided among them 650 silver talents, silver utensils weighing 100 talents, 100 talents of gold, 
15Ezr 8:27 20 gold basins weighing 1,000 darics each, and two vessels made of polished brass, as valuable as gold.8
15Ezr 8:28 I told them, "You are consecrated to the Lord, and the vessels are also consecrated. The silver and the gold are a freely given offering to the Lord God of your ancestors. 
15Ezr 8:29 Guard and protect them until you disperse them to the chief priests, the Levites, and to the family leaders of Israel at Jerusalem in the chambers of the temple of the Lord." 
15Ezr 8:30 So the priests and Levites took possession of the silver, the gold, and the vessels in order to bring them to Jerusalem, to the temple of our God.829
15Ezr 8:31 Then we left the Ahava River for Jerusalem on the twelfth day of the first month. Our God's protection was with us, and he delivered us from the enemy's power and from ambush along the way.
15Ezr 8:32 We arrived in Jerusalem and remained there three days. 
15Ezr 8:33 On the fourth day the silver, the gold, and the vessels were distributed at the temple of our God into the care of Uriah's son Meremoth the priest, Phinehas' son Eleazar, Jeshua's son Jozabad, and Binnui's son Noadiah, the Levites. 
15Ezr 8:34 Distribution was according to inventory and weight, with all weights being recorded at that time.
15Ezr 8:35 The descendants of those who had been taken into captivity and who had returned from captivity offered burnt offerings to the God of Israel£º twelve bulls for all of Israel, 96 rams, 77 lambs, and twelve male goats as a sin offering - all of them burnt offerings to the Lord. 
15Ezr 8:36 Then they delivered copies of the king's orders to the king's officers, and governors on this side of the Euphrates River. The orders were in support of the people and God's temple.
15Ezr 9:1 After these things occurred, certain officials approached me and said "The people of Israel, the priests, and the Levites have not separated themselves from the people of the lands or from the detestable behavior of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites, 
15Ezr 9:2 because they and their sons have married foreign women. As a result, the holy people have mingled themselves among the peoples of these lands. As a matter of fact, the senior officials and the rulers have been foremost in this sin."1
15Ezr 9:3 When I heard this, I tore both my garment and robe, plucked hair from both my head and my beard, and collapsed in shock! 
15Ezr 9:4 Then everyone who trembled at the words of the God of Israel gathered together as a group because of the sin committed by those who had been led astray. As for me, I remained seated, in shock, until the evening sacrifice.
15Ezr 9:5 At the time of the evening sacrifice, I arose from my discouragement. Still in my torn garment and robe, I fell to my knees with my hands outstretched to the Lord my God, 
15Ezr 9:6 and said, "My God, I am too ashamed and hurt to turn to you, because we're in our iniquities over our heads. Furthermore, my God, our sins have grown as high as the heavens. 
15Ezr 9:7 We have lived in great sin from the days of our ancestors even until today, and because of those iniquities we, our kings, and our priests have been delivered over to foreign kings, for execution, for captivity, for plunder, and for humiliation, as is the case today. 
15Ezr 9:8 Though now, for a moment, grace has been shown from the Lord our God, leaving a few survivors to escape, and providing us a secure hold in his holy place, so that our God might enlighten us and give us relief from our servitude. 
15Ezr 9:9 Even though we are slaves, our God has not abandoned us in our slavery. Instead, he has extended gracious love to us in the presence of the kings of Persia, to grant us revival, to set up the temple of our God, to repair its damage, and to give us a protective wall for Judah and Jerusalem.
15Ezr 9:10 Now, our God, what can we say besides this?Because we have abandoned your commandments 
15Ezr 9:11 that you gave in the writings of your servants, the prophets£º 'The land you are entering to possess is a morally unclean land due to the moral uncleanness of the peoples of the lands - along with their abominations - that has filled it from one end to the other with their impurities. 
15Ezr 9:12 So, therefore, do not give your daughters in marriage to their sons, nor marry their daughters to your sons, and under no circumstances are you to seek their well being or their wealth, so that you may remain strong, enjoying the best things the land has to give, and so that you may establish an inheritance for your children forever.'
15Ezr 9:13 "After all that has happened to us because of our evil behavior, and because of our great sin - considering that you our God have punished us less than our iniquities deserve and have given us this deliverance?
15Ezr 9:14 should we violate your commandments by intermarrying with the peoples who practice these abominations?Would you not be angry with us until you had consumed us, with not even a remnant surviving to escape - 
15Ezr 9:15 Lord God of Israel, you are just£º As a result, we remain here today delivered. Look at us! Because of our sin, we cannot stand in your presence as a result of everything that has happened."
15Ezr 10:1 Now while Ezra was praying and confessing in tears, having prostrated himself to the ground before the temple of God, a very large crowd of Israelites - men, women, and children - gathered around him. Indeed, the people were crying bitterly. 
15Ezr 10:2 Jehiel's son Shecaniah, one of Elam's descendants, responded to Ezra£º "We have sinned against our God by marrying foreign wives from the people of the land, but even now there is hope in Israel, despite this. 
15Ezr 10:3 So let's make a promise to our God by which we divorce all of these foreign wives - as well as those born to them - in accordance with the counsel of our Lord and of those who tremble at our God's command. Furthermore, let it be done according to the Law. 
15Ezr 10:4 So get up - it's your responsibility! We're with you. Be strong, and get to work."
15Ezr 10:5 So Ezra got up and made the chief priests, the Levites, and all of Israel vow to carry out everything they promised. And so they agreed. 
15Ezr 10:6 Ezra arose in front of the temple of God to visit the apartment of Eliashib's son Jehohanan. While there, he neither ate nor drank because he was in mourning over the sins of those who had returned from exile. 
15Ezr 10:7 Then they sent word throughout Judah and Jerusalem to everyone who had returned from the exile, to gather together in Jerusalem. 
15Ezr 10:8 Whoever would not come within three days would forfeit his assets and be separated from the community of the returning exiles, just as the high officials and elders had advised.6
15Ezr 10:9 Less than three days later, all of the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered together on the twentieth day of the ninth month. Everyone sat in the plaza of the temple of God, trembling because of everything that was happening, and also because it was raining heavily. 
15Ezr 10:10 Ezra the priest stood up and spoke to them, "You have sinned by marrying foreign wives, thereby increasing the transgressions of Israel. 
15Ezr 10:11 Now confess this to the Lord God of your ancestors, and separate yourselves from the peoples of the land and from foreign wives."
15Ezr 10:12 At this the entire community responded with a loud cry, "We will do just as you've spoken! 
15Ezr 10:13 However, many people are involved, and it's raining heavily. Furthermore, this is not just a matter of a day or two of work, because many of us have sinned in this. 
15Ezr 10:14 So let's have our officials remain on behalf of the whole community. Then all who have married foreign wives shall come appear at specific times before the elders and judges of each city until the fierce anger of our God has been turned away from us in this matter."
15Ezr 10:15 Only Asahel's son Jonathan and Tikvah's son Jahzeiah opposed this, and they were supported by Meshullam and Shabbethai the Levite.
15Ezr 10:16 So those who had returned from exile did this. Ezra the priest and leaders of certain ancestral groups listed by name devoted themselves to examine the situation on the first day of the tenth month. 
15Ezr 10:17 By the first day of the first month they concluded their investigation of all of the men who had married foreign wives.
15Ezr 10:18 Here is a list of priestly descendants who were found to have married foreign women. From Jeshua's descendants£º Jozadak's son and his brothers Maaseiah, Eliezer, Jarib, and Gedaliah. 
15Ezr 10:19 Pleading guilty, they promised to divorce their wives. Then they offered a ram from their flocks for their offense.

15Ezr 10:29 From Bani's descendants£º Meshullam, Malluch, Adaiah, Jashub, Sheal, and Jeremoth. 
15Ezr 10:30 From Pahath-moab's descendants£º Adna, Chelal, Benaiah, Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezalel, Binnui, and Manasseh.

15Ezr 10:43 From Nebo's descendants£º Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jaddai, Joel, and Benaiah.
15Ezr 10:44 All of these had married foreign wives, and some of them had children by them.

16Neh 1:1 In this book, I, Hacaliah's son Nehemiah, recount what occurred in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes during the month of Chislev, while I was in Shushan at the palace. 
16Neh 1:2 Hanani, one of my brothers, arrived with some men from Judah. I asked them about the Jews who had escaped, about those who had survived the Babylonian captivity, and about Jerusalem.
16Neh 1:3 They told me, "The survivors of the captivity there in the province are living in great distress and shame. Furthermore, the Jerusalem wall remains broken down and its gates have been burned by fire."
16Neh 1:4 When I heard this, I sat down and cried, mourning for a number of days while I fasted and prayed in the presence of the God of Heaven. 
16Neh 1:5 I said, "Please, Lord, God of Heaven, the great and fearsome God who keeps the covenant, showing gracious love to those who love you and keep your commands, 
16Neh 1:6 please turn your attention to observe carefully and listen to the prayer of your servant today that I am presenting to you day and night on behalf of your servants, the Israelites. "I confess the sins that we Israelites have committed against you. Both I and my father's house have sinned. 
16Neh 1:7 We have abandoned you by not keeping your commands, your ceremonies, and your judgments that you proscribed to your servant Moses. 
16Neh 1:8 Please remember what you spoke in commanding your servant Moses. You said, If you rebel, I will scatter you among the nations 
16Neh 1:9 but if you return to me, keeping my commands and doing them, even if your exiled people are in the farthest horizon, I will gather them from there and bring them to the place where I have chosen to establish my Name.1
16Neh 1:10 These are your servants as well as your people, whom you have redeemed by your great power and by your strong hand.
16Neh 1:11 "And now, Lord, I ask you to listen to the prayer of your servant - and to the prayers of your servants who delight in revering your Name. I ask you, please prosper your servant today by granting him to receive favor from this man." Now I was the king's senior security advisor.
16Neh 2:1 It came about in the twentieth year of Artaxerxes, during the month of Nissan, the king was about to drink some wine that I was preparing for him. Now I had never looked troubled in his presence.
16Neh 2:2 The king asked me, "Why do you look so troubled, since you're not ill?This cannot be anything else but troubles of the heart." Then I was filled with fear. 
16Neh 2:3 I replied to the king, "May the king live forever. Why shouldn't I be troubled, since the city where my ancestors' sepulchers are located lies waste, with its gates burned by fire?"
16Neh 2:4 The king answered, "What do you want?" So I prayed to the God of heaven 
16Neh 2:5 and I replied to the king, "If it seems good to you, and if your servant has found favor with you, would you send me to Judah, to the city where my ancestors' sepulchers are located, so I can rebuild it?"
16Neh 2:6 With his queen seated beside him, the king asked me, "How long will your journey take, and when will you return?" The king thought it was a good idea to send me, so I presented him with a prepared plan.
16Neh 2:7 I also asked the king, "If it seems good to you, order that letters of authorization be given me for the Trans-Euphrates governors, so they will allow me to pass through to Judah, 
16Neh 2:8 along with a letter to Asaph, the royal Commissioner of Forests, so that he will supply me with timber to craft beams for the gatehouses of the temple, for the city walls, and for the house in which I will be living." The king granted this for me, according to the good hand of my God. 
16Neh 2:9 So I went to the Trans-Euphrates governors and gave them the king's letters of authorization. The king also sent army officers and cavalry to accompany me. 
16Neh 2:10 But when Sanballat the Horonite and his servant Tobiah the Ammonite heard of this, they were greatly distressed because someone had come to do good for the Israelites. 
16Neh 2:11 I arrived in Jerusalem and remained there for three days. 
16Neh 2:12 Then I got up at night, along with a few men with me. I had not confided to any person what my God had put in my heart to do for Jerusalem. Furthermore, there was no other animal with me except for the one I was riding.
16Neh 2:13 So I went out during the night through the Valley Gate toward Dragon's Well, and from there to the Dung Gate, inspecting the walls of Jerusalem that were broken down and burned by fire. 
16Neh 2:14 I proceeded to the Fountain Gate, and then to the King's Pool, but there wasn't sufficient clearance for the animal I was riding to pass. 
16Neh 2:15 I traveled the valley by night to inspect the wall, returning through the Valley Gate. 
16Neh 2:16 The local officials did not know where I had gone or what I had done - I informed neither the Judeans, nor the priests, nor the nobles, nor the officials, nor any of the rest who would be doing the work.
16Neh 2:17 Later I told them, "You all are watching the predicament we're in, how Jerusalem lies desolate, with its gates burned by fire. Let's rebuild the Jerusalem wall so we're no longer a disgrace." 
16Neh 2:18 Then I told them how good my God had been to me, and about what the king had said to me. They replied, "Let's get out there and build!" So they encouraged themselves to do good.
16Neh 2:19 But when Sanballat the Horonite, his servant Tobiah the Ammonite, and Geshem the Arab heard about it, they jeered at us and despised us when they said, "What is this thing that you're doing?You're rebelling against the king, aren't you?"2
16Neh 2:20 In reply to them, I said, "The God of Heaven will prosper us. That's why we're preparing to build. But as far as you're concerned, there exists no ancestral heritage, no legal right, nor any historic claim in Jerusalem.
16Neh 3:1 So Eliashib the high priest came forward, along with his fellow priests, and reconstructed the Sheep Gate. They consecrated it and installed its doors. They also consecrated the wall as far as the Tower of the Hundred and the Tower of Hananel. 
16Neh 3:2 Men from Jericho did repairs next to him, and Imri's son Zaccur son did repairs next to them.
16Neh 3:3 The Fish Gate was repaired by Hassenaah's sons. They built its framework and installed its doors, including locks and security bars, 
16Neh 3:4 with Uriah's son Meremoth (who was also a grandson of Hakkoz) next to them, Berechiah's son Meshullam (who was also a grandson of Meshezabel) next to them, and next to him Baana's son Zadok. 
16Neh 3:5 Next to them the Tekoites worked valiantly, even though their leading officials weren't fully dedicated to the work of their lord.
16Neh 3:6 Paseah's son Joiada and Besodeiah's son Meshullam repaired the Old Gate. They built its framework and installed its doors, including locks and security bars. 
16Neh 3:7 Next to them, Melatiah the Gibeonite and Jadon the Meronothite were working with men from Gibeon and men from Mizpah under the Trans-Euphrates regional governor. 
16Neh 3:8 Nearby, Harhaiah's son Uzziel the goldsmith was carrying on repairs, and next to him Hananiah, a perfume-maker, rebuilt Jerusalem as far as the Broad Wall.6
16Neh 3:9 Next to him, Hur's son Rephaiah, ruling official for half of the Jerusalem district, did repairs. 
16Neh 3:10 Then next to them, Harumaph's son Jedaiah did repairs opposite his house, and next to him Hashaabneiah's son Hattush carried on repairs. 
16Neh 3:11 Harim's son Malchijah and Pahath-moab's son Hasshub repaired another section, along with the Tower of the Ovens, 
16Neh 3:12 and next to him Hallohesh's son Shallum, ruling official for the other half of the Jerusalem district, did repairs, as did his daughters.11
16Neh 3:13 Hanun and the residents of Zanoah repaired the Valley Gate, reconstructing it and installing its doors, including locks and security bars. They also rebuilt 500 yards of the wall as far as the Dung Gate. 
16Neh 3:14 Rechab's descendant Malchijah, ruling official of the Beth-haccherem district, repaired the Dung Gate, reconstructing it, installing its doors, its locks, and its security bars. 
16Neh 3:15 Colhozeh's son Shallum, ruling official of the Mizpah district, repaired the Fountain Gate, reconstructing it, installing its doors, its locks, and its security bars, as well as the Pool of Shelach near the royal garden as far as the stairway that descends from the city of David.
16Neh 3:16 Next to him Azbuk's son Nehemiah, ruling official of half of the Beth-zur district, carried on repairs as far as the tombs of David, then to the artificial pool that had been installed there, and then as far as the military barracks. 
16Neh 3:17 Next to him the Levites, led by Bani's son Rehum, carried on repairs. Next to him Hashabiah, ruling official for half of the Keilah district, did repairs for his district. 
16Neh 3:18 Next to him their brothers, led by Henadad's son Bavvai, ruling official for the other half of the Keilah district, carried on repairs. 
16Neh 3:19 Next to him Jeshua's son Ezer, ruling official of Mizpah, repaired another section near the ascent to the armory at the Angle. 
16Neh 3:20 Next to him Zaccai's son Baruch worked valiantly on another section from the angle of the wall as far as the door to the house belonging to Eliashib the high priest.
16Neh 3:21 Then next to him Uriah's son Meremoth, grandson of Hakkoz, repaired another section from the door of Eliashib's house as far as the rear of the property, 
16Neh 3:22 Next to him the priests, men from the plain, carried on repairs. 
16Neh 3:23 Next to them Benjamin and Hasshub carried on repairs near their house, followed by Maaseiah's son Azariah, grandson of Ananiah, who worked beside his own house. 
16Neh 3:24 Following him, Henadad's son Binnui repaired another section from Azariah's house to the angle of the wall, and then to the corner. 
16Neh 3:25 Uzai's son Palal carried on repairs over against the angle of the wall at the tower that stands out from the king's upper palace, which is located by the royal guard's court. Next to him, Parosh's son Pedaiah carried on repairs. 
16Neh 3:26 (Now the temple Servants were living on the Ophel as far as the Water Gate that faces eastward with its prominent tower.) 
16Neh 3:27 Next to Pediah, the Tekoites repaired another section from the prominent tower as far as the wall of the Ophel.322
16Neh 3:28 The priests carried on repairs from above the Horse Gate as far as their own houses. 
16Neh 3:29 Then next to them, Immer's son Zadok did repairs as far as his own house. Next to him, Shechaniah's son Shemaiah, custodian of the East Gate, carried on repairs. 
16Neh 3:30 Next to him, Shelemiah's son Hananiah and Zalaph's sixth son Hanun repaired another section. Next to him, Berechiah's son Meshullam carried on repairs up to his chamber. 
16Neh 3:31 Next to him, Malchijah, one of the goldsmiths, carried on repairs up to the house of the temple Servants and the merchants, up to the Muster Gate as far as the ascent to the corner. 
16Neh 3:32 Between the ascent of the corner and the Sheep Gate, the goldsmiths and merchants carried on repairs.
16Neh 4:1 When Sanballat heard that we were reconstructing the wall, he flew into a rage, became indignant, and mocked the Jews. 
16Neh 4:2 He addressed his allies and the Samaritan officials, saying "What are these pathetic Jews doing?Are they intending to rebuild it by themselves?Do they intend to offer sacrifices?Will they finish in a single day?Can they make stones from this burned out rubble?"
16Neh 4:3 Tobiah the Ammonite stood to the side, commenting, "If a fox were to jump onto what they're building, it would collapse their stone wall!"
16Neh 4:4 "Listen, our God, because we are being mocked. Let their insults fall back on them, and let them be dragged away as captives into exile. 
16Neh 4:5 Don't atone their iniquity, and don't let their sin be blotted out from before you, because they have demoralized the builders."
16Neh 4:6 So we rebuilt the wall, completing it halfway up, because the people were committed to working.
16Neh 4:7 But when Sanballat, Tobiah, the Arabs, the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites heard that the repair work on the Jerusalem wall was progressing and that its breaches were being repaired, they flew into a rage. 
16Neh 4:8 So they all conspired together to invade and fight against Jerusalem, creating confusion there.
16Neh 4:9 But we prayed to our God. We also set up guards day and night because of them.
16Neh 4:10 Meanwhile, the people of Judah said, "The builders are tired and there's so much rubble that we can't reconstruct the wall!"
16Neh 4:11 Our enemies said, "Before they notice or see us, we'll penetrate their midst, kill them, and stop the work!"
16Neh 4:12 The Jews who lived near them kept coming to us, reporting at least ten times, "They'll attack us from every direction." 
16Neh 4:13 So I stationed the people by families behind the wall in the lower exposed areas, equipping them with their swords, spears, and bows.
16Neh 4:14 Looking things over, I stood up and spoke to the officials, the military leaders, and the rest of the people£º "Don't fear them. Remember the great and awe-inspiring Lord. Fight for your brothers, your sons, your daughters, your wives, and your homes."
16Neh 4:15 Our opponents heard that we had learned about them, that God had brought their plans to failure, and that each and every one of us had come to work on the wall. 
16Neh 4:16 From that day on, half of my helpers engaged in the work while the other half kept spears, shields, bows, and armor ready. The senior officials backed all of the Judeans 
16Neh 4:17 who worked on the wall. Those who carried building materials worked with one hand, carrying a spear in the other. 
16Neh 4:18 Each builder worked with a sword strapped to his side, while a trumpeter remained beside me to sound an alarm.417
16Neh 4:19 I told the officials, rulers, and the rest of the people, "The project is large and extensive, and we are separated from each other on the wall, 
16Neh 4:20 so wherever you hear the sound of the trumpet, come over to us, and our God will fight for us!" 
16Neh 4:21 So we worked hard, half of us holding spears from dawn to dusk.
16Neh 4:22 At the same time I said to the people, "Let's have everyone sleep at night inside Jerusalem with their servants, so they can guard us at night and work during the day. 
16Neh 4:23 No one - neither I, my allies, my servants, nor the bodyguards who accompanied me - changed clothes. Everyone carried a weapon even while going for water.
16Neh 5:1 Now the people along with their spouses complained loudly against their fellow Jews, 
16Neh 5:2 because certain of them kept claiming, "Since we have so many sons and daughters, we must get some grain so we can eat and survive."
16Neh 5:3 Others were saying, "We're having to mortgage our fields, our vineyards, and our homes so we can buy grain during this famine."
16Neh 5:4 Still others were saying "We've borrowed money against our fields and vineyards to pay the king's taxes. 
16Neh 5:5 Now our bodies are no different than the bodies of our relatives, and our children are like their children. Nevertheless, we're about to force our sons and daughters into slavery, and some of our daughters are already in bondage. It's beyond our power to do anything about it, because our fields and vineyards belong to others."
16Neh 5:6 I became very livid when I heard their complaining and these charges. 
16Neh 5:7 So after thinking it over carefully, I accused the officials and nobles openly, "Every one of you is charging your fellow countrymen interest!" So I opened a public investigation against them.
16Neh 5:8 I accused them, "To the best of our ability, we've been buying back our fellow Jews who had been sold to foreigners. Even now you're selling your fellow countrymen, only for them to be sold back to us!" They kept quiet and never spoke a word.
16Neh 5:9 So I said, "What you're doing isn't right! Shouldn't you live in the fear of our God to avoid shame from our foreign enemies?
16Neh 5:10 I'm also lending money and grain, as are my fellow-Jews and my servants, but let's not charge interest. 
16Neh 5:11 So today please restore to them their fields, vineyards, olive orchards, and homes, along with the one percent interest charge that you've assessed them on the grain, wine, and oil."
16Neh 5:12 They responded, "We will restore these things, and will assess no interest charges against them. We will do what you are requesting!" So I called the priests and made them take an oath to fulfill this promise. 
16Neh 5:13 I also shook my robes, and said, "May God shake out every man from his house and his possessions who does not keep this promise. May he be emptied out and shaken just like this." All the assembly said, "Amen!" and praised the Lord. And the people kept their promise.
16Neh 5:14 In addition, from the time that I was appointed to be their governor in the land of Judah (that is, during the twelve years from the twentieth to the thirty-second year of King Artaxerxes), neither I nor my relatives relied on the provisions allotted to the governor. 
16Neh 5:15 Nevertheless, the former governors before me placed a heavy burden on the people. They received food and wine, plus a tax of 40 shekels of silver. Even their young men took advantage of the people, but I never did so because I feared God.14
16Neh 5:16 Also, as I continued to work on the wall, we purchased no land, and all of my young men were employed in the work. 
16Neh 5:17 I fed 150 Jews and officials every day, not counting those who came from the nations around us. 
16Neh 5:18 Our daily requirements were one ox and six choice sheep, along with various kinds of poultry prepared for me. Every ten days there was a delivery of an abundant supply of wine. Despite all this, I refused the governor's allotment, because demands on the people were heavy.5
16Neh 5:19 "Remember me with favor, my God, for everything I've done for this people."
16Neh 6:1 When Sanballat, Tobiah, Geshem the Arab, and the rest of our enemies heard that I had completed the wall and that no break remained in it (even though by that time I hadn't yet installed the doors in the gates), 
16Neh 6:2 Sanballat and Geshem sent word to me, saying "Come, let's meet together at Kepharim on the Ono Plain." But they were just trying to do me harm.
16Neh 6:3 So I sent messengers to them, replying "I am involved in a great endeavor, so I can't leave. Why should the work stop while I leave it to come down to you?" 
16Neh 6:4 They sent me this message four times, and I answered them the same way.
16Neh 6:5 Then Sanballat sent his assistant to me the fifth time. But this time the letter was sent unsealed, and 
16Neh 6:6 in it was written£º It is reported among the nations - and Gashmu confirms this - that you and the Jews are planning a revolt, and that you're rebuilding the wall in order to declare yourself king. According to these reports, 
16Neh 6:7 you also have appointed prophets to proclaim about you in Jerusalem, "There is a king in Judah!" Since these words are being reported to the king, come and let's meet together.
16Neh 6:8 I sent word back to him, "Nothing has happened as you've claimed. You're making up these charges in your imagination." 
16Neh 6:9 For they all were trying to make us afraid by saying, "Their hands will become tired from laboring, so the work won't be completed." "Therefore, Lord, strengthen my hands!"
16Neh 6:10 Later I visited Delaiah's son Shemaiah, a grandson of Mehetabel, who was confined at home. He kept urging me, "Let's meet together at the house of God, within the temple, and take refuge there, because they're coming to kill you. In fact, they're coming at night to kill you!"6
16Neh 6:11 But I asked him, "Should a man like me run?Should someone like me run into the temple to save his life?I won't go there!" 
16Neh 6:12 I perceived that God had not sent him. Instead, Tobiah and Sanballat had hired him to pronounce this prophecy against me. 
16Neh 6:13 He had been hired to make me afraid so I would sin by doing what he suggested. Then they could create a slanderous report to use against me.
16Neh 6:14 "Remember me, my God, and take note of what Tobiah and Sanballat are doing. Also take note of the prophetess Noadiah and the rest of the prophets who intend to make me afraid."
16Neh 6:15 So the wall was completed on the twenty-fifth day of Elul in 52 days.
16Neh 6:16 When all of our enemies - including the surrounding nations - heard this, they became very discouraged, since they saw that the work had been done by our God. 
16Neh 6:17 Meanwhile, at that time the nobles of Judah continued to send many letters to Tobiah, and Tobiah kept sending letters to them. 
16Neh 6:18 For many Judeans had sworn allegiance to him, since he was son-in-law to Arah's son Shecaniah, and his son Jehohanan had married the daughter of Berechiah's son Meshullam. 
16Neh 6:19 Furthermore, they kept reporting Tobiah's good deeds to me, and kept repeating what I said to him. Tobiah kept sending letters to intimidate me.
16Neh 7:1 After the wall had been completed and its doors installed, then the gatekeepers, singers, and Levites were appointed. 
16Neh 7:2 I appointed my brother Hanani and fortress commander Hananiah to be over Jerusalem, since he was a faithful person who revered God more than many others did. 
16Neh 7:3 I charged them, "Do not open the gates of Jerusalem until mid-day. Until then, let everyone stand watch, keeping the gates shut and locked. Appoint security watches from those who live in Jerusalem. Everyone should maintain his own watch near his house." 
16Neh 7:4 Even though the city was large and spread out, not many people were living there and not many houses had been built. 
16Neh 7:5 So my God gave me the idea to gather together the nobles, the officials, and the people so they could be registered according to their genealogies.4I found a register of the original inhabitants in which there was recorded 
16Neh 7:6 a list of descendants of the province of Judah who returned from captivity, from those who had been exiled by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon. They had come back to Jerusalem and to Judah, each one to his town. 
16Neh 7:7 They were coming with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah, Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, and Baanah. Here is the enumeration of£º The Men of Israel:
16Neh 7:8 Parosh's descendants£º 2,172

16Neh 7:60 All of the temple Servants and descendants of Solomon's servants numbered 392.
16Neh 7:61 Here is a list of returnees from Tel-melah, Tel-harsha, Cherub, Addan, and Immer, who could not prove their ancestry and lineage from Israel:
16Neh 7:62 Descendants of Delaiah, Tobiah, and Nekoda 642
16Neh 7:63 Of the Priests£º Descendants of Habaiah, Koz, and Barzillai, who married one of the daughters of Barzillai from Gilead and took that name.
16Neh 7:64 These people searched for their ancestral records, but they couldn't be located. Accordingly, they were considered disqualified from the priesthood. 
16Neh 7:65 The governor ordered them not to eat anything holy until a priest would be installed with Urim and Thummim.
16Neh 7:66 The entire assembly numbered 42,360, 
16Neh 7:67 not including their 7,337 male and female servants. They had 245 men and women singers. 
16Neh 7:68 They had 736 horses, 245 mules, 
16Neh 7:69 435 camels, and 6,720 donkeys.
16Neh 7:70 Some of the heads of the families contributed to the work. The governor contributed 1,000 gold drachmas to the treasury, along with 50 basins, and 530 priestly garments. 
16Neh 7:71 Some of the heads of the families gave to the treasury 20,000 gold drachmas and 2,200 silver units for the work. 
16Neh 7:72 The rest of the people gave 20,000 gold drachmas, 2,000 silver units, and 67 priestly garments.
16Neh 7:73 The priests, Levites, gatekeepers, singers, some of the people, the temple Servants, and all the Israelites settled in their cities. Seven months later, the Israelites had settled in their own cities. 
16Neh 8:1 All the people gathered as a united body into the plaza in front of the Water Gate. They asked Ezra the scribe to bring out the book of the Law of Moses, which the Lord had commanded for Israel. 
16Neh 8:2 So on the first day of the seventh month, Ezra the priest brought out the Law before the assembled people. Both men and women were in attendance, as well as all who could understand what they were hearing.
16Neh 8:3 Ezra read from it, facing the plaza in front of the Water Gate, from early in the morning until mid-day in the presence of the men and women, as well as all who could understand. All the people were attentive to the Book of the Law. 
16Neh 8:4 Ezra the scribe stood on a wooden rostrum erected for that purpose. Beside him to his right stood Mattithiah, Shema, Anaiah, Uriah, Hilkiah, and Masseiah. Beside him to his left stood Pedaiah, Mishael, Malchijah, Hashum, Hashbaddanah, Zechariah, and Meshullam.
16Neh 8:5 Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people. Because he was visible above all the people there, as he opened it, all the people stood up. 
16Neh 8:6 Ezra blessed the Lord, the great God, and with uplifted hands, all the people responded, "Amen! Amen!" They bowed down and worshiped the Lord prostrate on the ground.
16Neh 8:7 Furthermore, Jeshua, Bani, Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub, Shabbethai, Hodiah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad, Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites taught the Law to the people while the people remained standing. 
16Neh 8:8 They read from the book of the Law of God, distinctly communicating its meaning, so they could understand the reading.
16Neh 8:9 Because all the people were weeping as they listened to the words of the Law, Nehemiah the governor, Ezra the priest and scribe, and the Levites who taught the people said to everyone, "This day is holy to the Lord your God. Do not mourn or weep." 
16Neh 8:10 He also said to them, "Go eat the best food, drink the best wine, and give something to those who have nothing, since this day is holy to our Lord. Don't be sorrowful, because the joy of the Lord is your strength."9
16Neh 8:11 The Levites also calmed all the people by saying, "Be still, for the day is holy. Don't be sorrowful!"
16Neh 8:12 So all the people went to eat, to drink, to send something to those who had nothing, and to celebrate with great joy, because they understood the words that were being declared to them.
16Neh 8:13 The next day, the heads of the families of all the people were gathered together, along with the priests and the Levites, to meet with Ezra the scribe in order to understand the words of the Law. 
16Neh 8:14 They found written in the Law that the Lord had commanded through Moses that the Israelites were to live in tents during the feast scheduled for the seventh month. 
16Neh 8:15 So they circulated a proclamation throughout their towns and in Jerusalem. It said, "Go out to the hill country and bring back olive branches, wild olive branches, myrtle branches, palm branches, and branches of mature trees, in order to set up tents, as has been written."
16Neh 8:16 Then the people went out and found branches to make tents for themselves on the roofs of their houses, in their courtyards, and in the courts of God's temple, in the plaza near the Water Gate, and in the plaza near the Gate of Ephraim. 
16Neh 8:17 The entire assembly of those who had returned from exile erected tents and lived in them. Indeed, from the days of Nun's son Joshua until that day the Israelites had not done so. Joy was everywhere, 
16Neh 8:18 and Ezra continued to read from the book of the Law of God day by day, from the first day through the last. They celebrated for seven days, and on the eighth day they held a solemn assembly according to regulation.816
16Neh 9:1 On the twenty-fourth day of this same month, the Israelites gathered together while fasting, wearing sackcloth, and covering themselves with dust. 
16Neh 9:2 The remnant of Israel separated themselves from all foreigners. Then they stood and confessed their sins and the iniquities of their ancestors. 
16Neh 9:3 While they stood there, they read from the book of the Law of the Lord their God for one fourth of the day, and they confessed and worshiped the Lord their God for another fourth of the day. 
16Neh 9:4 Jeshua, Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani stood on the Levite's rostrum and cried out loudly to the Lord their God. 
16Neh 9:5 Then the Levites - Jeshua, Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabneiah, Sherebiah, Hodiah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah - said, "Stand up and bless the Lord your God from eternity to eternity! Blessed be your glorious name! May it be exalted above all blessing and praise!
16Neh 9:6 "You are the Lord; you alone crafted the heavens, the highest heavens with all of their armies; the earth, and everything in it; the seas, and everything in them; you keep giving all of them life, and the army of heaven continually worships you.
16Neh 9:7 You are the Lord, the God who chose Abram, whom you brought from Ur of the Chaldeans and to whom you gave the name Abraham.
16Neh 9:8 You found him faithful in your sight; you made a covenant with him and you gave the land of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, and the Girgashites to his descendants. And you have kept your word, because you are righteous.
16Neh 9:9 "You took note of the affliction of our ancestors in Egypt, and listened to their cry at the Red Sea.
16Neh 9:10 You sent signs and wonders against Pharaoh, against all of his officials, and against all the people of his land, because you knew they acted arrogantly against your people. So you established your name with them, as it remains to this day.
16Neh 9:11 You divided the sea in front of them, and they traveled through the midst of the sea on dry ground. You hurled their pursuers into the depths, as one throws a stone into turbulent waters.
16Neh 9:12 You led them during the day by a pillar of cloud, and by a pillar of fire at night to provide light for them on the path they took.
16Neh 9:13 "You also came down to Mount Sinai, spoke with them from heaven, and gave them impartial regulations, true laws, statutes, and good commands.
16Neh 9:14 You revealed to them your holy Sabbath, and you mandated precepts, statutes, and laws through Moses your servant.
16Neh 9:15 You gave them food from heaven for their hunger and water from the rock for their thirst. You directed them to enter and possess the land that you had promised to give them.
16Neh 9:16 "But they - our ancestors - became arrogant and stubborn, refusing to listen to your commands.
16Neh 9:17 They would not listen, and did not remember the miracles you did among them. Instead, they became stubborn and appointed a leader to return them to their slavery. "But you are a God of forgiveness, gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and rich in gracious love; therefore you did not abandon them.
16Neh 9:18 Moreover, after they had cast a golden calf for themselves, they said, "This is your god who brought you out of Egypt!" and committed terrible blasphemies.
16Neh 9:19 You, in your great compassion, did not abandon them in the wilderness. The pillar of cloud did not leave them in daylight, in order to provide light for them on the path they took. Nor did the pillar of fire abandon them at night, in order to provide light for them and lead them on the path they took.
16Neh 9:20 "You gave your good Spirit to instruct them, not withholding manna from them, and providing water to quench their thirst.
16Neh 9:21 You sustained them in the wilderness for 40 years. They lacked nothing. Their clothes did not wear out, and their feet did not swell.
16Neh 9:22 You gave them kingdoms and nations, apportioning them as frontier boundaries. They took possession of the land of Sihon, the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og, king of Bashan.
16Neh 9:23 "You multiplied their descendants like the stars in heaven and brought them to the land about which you told their ancestors to enter and possess.
16Neh 9:24 So their descendants entered and took possession of the land. Before their eyes you subdued those living in the land - the Canaanites - putting them under their control, along with their kings and the peoples of the land, so they could do with them as they pleased.
16Neh 9:25 They conquered fortified cities and fertile ground, possessing houses filled with all kinds of good things, wells already dug, with vineyards, olive orchards, and fruit trees in abundance. So they ate, were satiated, and were well nourished, delighting themselves in your great goodness.
16Neh 9:26 "Then they disobeyed, rebelled against you, and threw your Law behind their backs. They murdered your prophets who had admonished the people to return to you, committing terrible blasphemies.
16Neh 9:27 So you delivered them into the control of their enemies, who oppressed them. But when they were oppressed, they cried out to you, and you heard from heaven. In your great compassion you gave them deliverers who rescued them from the control of their enemies.
16Neh 9:28 "But after they had gained relief, they returned to doing evil before you. Therefore you abandoned them to the control of their enemies, who continued to oppress them. But when they came back and cried out to you, you listened from heaven and delivered them in your compassion on many occasions.
16Neh 9:29 You admonished them to return to your law, but they acted arrogantly, and would not listen to your commands. They sinned against your regulations, which if anyone obeys, he will live by them. They turned away, being stubborn and stiff-necked, and they did not listen.
16Neh 9:30 You were patient with them for many years, warning them by your Spirit through your prophets. But they would not listen, so you turned them over to the control of people in other lands.
16Neh 9:31 Nevertheless, in your great compassion you did not completely destroy them or abandon them, because you are a God of grace and you are merciful.
16Neh 9:32 "Now therefore, our God, the great, mighty, and awesome God, who keeps the covenant and gracious love, don't let all of the difficulties seem trifling to you, all of hardships that have come upon us, upon our kings, upon our leaders, upon our priests, upon our prophets, upon our ancestors, and upon all of your people from the time of the kings of Assyria until this day.
16Neh 9:33 You are righteous in all that is happening to us, because you have acted faithfully while we have practiced evil.
16Neh 9:34 Furthermore, neither our kings, nor our leaders, nor our priests nor our ancestors have practiced your law or paid attention to your commands and warnings by which you admonished them.
16Neh 9:35 But they in their kingdom - in the midst of your great goodness that you gave them and in the large and fertile land that you provided them - did not serve you or turn away from their evil deeds.
16Neh 9:36 "Look! Today we are your servants, along with the land that you gave to our ancestors, so they could enjoy its fruit and its value - behold, in it we are your servants!
16Neh 9:37 But now its abundant produce belongs to the kings whom you placed over us because of our sin. They also have power over our bodies and our herds, at their pleasure, and we are in great distress.
16Neh 9:38 "Because of all this, we are making a binding agreement, putting it in writing, and our leaders, our Levites, and our priests hereby set their seals upon it."

16Neh 10:28 The rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the gatekeepers, the singers, the temple Servants, and everyone who had separated themselves from the peoples of the surrounding lands for the Law of God - their wives, their sons, their daughters, and all who had knowledge and understanding?
16Neh 10:29 joined with their relatives and their leaders. They entered into an oath - enforced by a curse - to walk in God's Law that was given through God's servant Moses, and to be careful to obey all of commands of the Lord, our Lord, as well as his regulations and statutes.
16Neh 10:30 We will not give our daughters in marriage to the people of the land, nor take their daughters for our sons. 
16Neh 10:31 As for the people of the land who bring merchandise or grain to sell on the Sabbath day, we will not buy from them on the Sabbath or on any holy day. We will forego planting crops, and we will cancel debts during every seventh year.
16Neh 10:32 We also obligated ourselves to contribute annually a third of a shekel for services relating to the temple of our God£º 
16Neh 10:33 for the bread set out on the table, for the continual grain offering, for the continual burnt offering, for the Sabbath offerings, for the new moon festivals, for the appointed feasts, for the holy offerings, for the sin offerings to make atonement for Israel, and for all the service of the temple of our God.
16Neh 10:34 We - the priests, the Levites, and the people - cast lots to determine when to bring the wood offering into the temple of our God, just as our ancestors' families were appointed annually to maintain the altar fire of the Lord our God, as recorded in the Law. 
16Neh 10:35 We also cast lots to determine when to bring the first fruits of our land and the annual first fruits of all fruit of every tree to the temple of the Lord, 
16Neh 10:36 as well as the first born of our sons and our cattle, as recorded in the Law, along with the firstlings of our herds and our flocks, to present to the temple of our God for the priests that minister in the temple of our God. 
16Neh 10:37 We also determined to present the first fruits of our ground grain, our offerings, the fruit of all kinds of trees, wines, and oil to the priests, to the chambers of the temple of our God, and the tithes of our land to the Levites, so those Levites could collect the tithes in all the towns where we worked.1035
16Neh 10:38 And the priest, the descendant of Aaron, will be with the Levites when the Levites receive tithes, and the Levites will bring the tithe of the tithes into the store rooms of the temple of our God. 
16Neh 10:39 For the Israelites and the descendants of Levi will bring the grain offering, the wine, and the oil into the chambers where the vessels of the sanctuary are, along with the ministering priests, the porters, and the singers. We will not neglect the temple of our God.
16Neh 11:1 The leaders of the people who lived in Jerusalem, along with the rest of the people, decided to choose one out of ten of them by lot to live in Jerusalem, the holy city, leaving the other nine of them in their towns.

16Neh 12:7 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, and Jediah. These were the leaders of the priests and their associates in the time of Jeshua.4
16Neh 12:8 The Levites included Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah, Judah, and Mattaniah, who with his associates was in charge of the songs of thanksgiving. 
16Neh 12:9 Bakbukiah and Unni and their associates stood opposite them in the service. 
16Neh 12:10 Jeshua fathered Joiakim, Joiakim fathered Elishib, and Eliashib fathered Joiada. 
16Neh 12:11 Joiada fathered Jonathan and Jonathan fathered Jaddua.
16Neh 12:12 These were the priests and heads of their ancestors' houses in the time of Joiakim£º of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah; 
16Neh 12:13 of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan; 
16Neh 12:14 of Malluchi, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph; 
16Neh 12:15 of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai; 
16Neh 12:16 of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam; 
16Neh 12:17 of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Modiah, Piltai; 
16Neh 12:18 of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan; 
16Neh 12:19 of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi; 
16Neh 12:20 of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber; 
16Neh 12:21 of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethanel.
16Neh 12:22 When Eliashib, Joiada, Johanan, and Jaddua were serving, the Levites were recorded as heads of their ancestors' houses, as were the priests during the reign of Darius the Persian. 
16Neh 12:23 The leaders of the ancestors of Levi were written in the Book of Annals until the time of Eliashib's son Johanan.
16Neh 12:24 The leaders of the Levites were£º Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Kadmiel's son Jeshua, along with their associates who served opposite them to give praise and thanks, division by division, according to the commands given by David the man of God. 
16Neh 12:25 Mattaniah, Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, and Akkub were gatekeepers who guarded the store houses of the gates. 
16Neh 12:26 These were at the time of Jeshua's son Joiakim, the grandson of Jozadak, and in the time of Nehemiah the governor and Ezra the priest and scribe.24
16Neh 12:27 At the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem, they invited the Levites to come from wherever they lived to Jerusalem so they could celebrate the dedication with joy, thanksgiving, and songs, accompanied by cymbals, lyres, and harps. 
16Neh 12:28 So the descendants of the singers gathered themselves together from the region surrounding Jerusalem, from the villages of Netophathi, 
16Neh 12:29 from Beth-gilgal, and from the area of Geba and Azmaveth, because the singers had built villages for themselves in the vicinity of Jerusalem. 
16Neh 12:30 The priests and the Levites purified themselves, and also purified the people, the gates, and the wall.29
16Neh 12:31 Then I brought up the leaders of Judah to the crest of the wall, and appointed two large thanksgiving choirs, the first of which proceeded on the wall to the right toward the Dung Gate. 
16Neh 12:32 Following them were Hoshaiah and half of the leaders of Judah, 
16Neh 12:33 including Azariah, Ezra, Meshullam, 
16Neh 12:34 Judah, Benjamin, Shemaiah, and Jeremiah. 
16Neh 12:35 Some of the priests' sons were trumpeters, including Zechariah son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son of Micaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of Asaph, 
16Neh 12:36 with his associates Shemaiah, Azarel, Milalai, Gilalai, Maai, Nethanel, Judah, and Hanani, accompanied by the musical instruments of David, the man of God. Ezra the scribe led the procession. 
16Neh 12:37 At the Fountain Gate, which stood opposite them, they ascended the stairs of the city of David where the wall rose above the house of David east of the Water Gate.
16Neh 12:38 The second thanksgiving choir approached opposite them, and I followed them. Half of the people stood on the crest of the wall from beyond the Tower of the Ovens to the Broad Wall, 
16Neh 12:39 and from above the Ephraim Gate, above the Fish Gate, the Tower of Hananel and the Tower of the Hundred, as far as the Sheep Gate. They stopped at the Guard Gate. 
16Neh 12:40 Then the two choirs assembled in the temple of God, as did I, along with half of the officials who accompanied me, 
16Neh 12:41 and the priests Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Micaiah, Elioenai, Zechariah, Hananiah with trumpeters 
16Neh 12:42 Maaseiah, Shemaiah, Eleazar, Uzzi, Jehohanan, Malcijah, Elam, and Ezer. And the singers made their presence known, with Jezrahiah to lead them.
16Neh 12:43 That day they offered a large number of sacrifices, and they rejoiced, because God had caused them to rejoice enthusiastically. Their wives and children rejoiced, so that the Jerusalem's joy was heard from a long distance. 
16Neh 12:44 Also at that time men were appointed over the storerooms for the contributions, for the first fruits, and for the tithes, so those portions required by the Law could be gathered from the fields adjacent to the towns to benefit the priests and Levites, for the people of Judah rejoiced over the priests and the Levites who were serving. 
16Neh 12:45 They carried out their service obligations to their God and their service obligations of purification according to what David and his son Solomon had commanded. 
16Neh 12:46 For in David's lifetime - and in the lifetime of Asaph, choir master of old - there were songs of praise and thanksgiving to God. 
16Neh 12:47 All Israel in the time of Zerubbabel and in the time of Nehemiah gave allotments to each of the singers and gate keepers on a daily basis, setting them apart to benefit the Levites. And the Levites set them apart to benefit the descendants of Aaron.1244
16Neh 13:1 Later that day the book of Moses was read aloud so the people could hear it, and a written command was discovered therein permanently prohibiting the Ammonites and Moabites from coming into the congregation of God 
16Neh 13:2 because they did not greet the Israelites with food and water, but instead hired Balaam to oppose them by cursing them, even though our God turned the curse into a blessing. 
16Neh 13:3 When they heard the law, they separated all those of foreign descent from Israel.
16Neh 13:4 Now prior to this, Eliashib the priest, who supervised the store rooms of the temple of our God and who was related to Tobiah, 
16Neh 13:5 had prepared a great chamber for him, in the place where they used to place the grain offerings, incense, and vessels, along with the tithes of the grain, the new wine, and the oil that was mandated for the Levites, the singers, the gate keepers, and the priests' offerings. 
16Neh 13:6 During all of this time, I was not in Jerusalem, because I had returned to the king in the thirty-second year of Artaxerxes, king of Babylon. After a while I obtained permission from the king 
16Neh 13:7 to return to Jerusalem. I learned of the evil thing that Eliashib had done for Tobiah in furnishing him with a room in the courts of the temple of God. 
16Neh 13:8 I was greatly upset, so I threw out all of Tobiah's property from the room. 
16Neh 13:9 I ordered them to purify the chambers, and then they brought back the vessels from the temple of God, along with the grain offerings and incense.7
16Neh 13:10 I also learned that the allotments for the Levites had not been distributed. As a result, the Levites and singers who were responsible for the service had each left to go back to their fields. 
16Neh 13:11 So I confronted the officials and asked, "Why is the temple of God neglected?" Then I gathered them together and put them back in their places. 
16Neh 13:12 Then all of Judah brought the tithe of the grain, the new wine, and the oil into the storerooms. 
16Neh 13:13 I appointed over the storerooms£º Shelemiah the priest, Zadok the scribe, and Pedaiah from the Levites; and next to them Zaccur's son Hanan, the grandson of Mattaniah, because they had been considered faithful. Their duties were to distribute to their associates.10
16Neh 13:14 Remember me, my God, concerning this, and do not erase my faithful deeds that I have undertaken for the temple of my God, and for its services.
16Neh 13:15 At that time I saw in Judah some who were treading wine presses on the Sabbath, bringing in sacks of grain, loading them onto donkeys, along with wine, grapes, figs, and all kinds of loads. They brought them into Jerusalem on the Sabbath day. So I rebuked them on the day on which they were selling food. 
16Neh 13:16 Furthermore, Tyrians were living there who were importing fish and all kinds of merchandise, selling them to the people of Judah on the Sabbath, even in Jerusalem.
16Neh 13:17 I rebuked the officials of Judah, saying to them, "What's this evil thing that you're doing by profaning the Sabbath day?
16Neh 13:18 Didn't your ancestors do the same?And didn't our God bring on us and on this city all of this trouble?Now you're adding to the wrath against Israel by profaning the Sabbath!"
16Neh 13:19 As the Sabbath approached and it began to get dark at the gates of Jerusalem, I gave word to shut the gates, charging that they should not be opened until after the Sabbath. I stationed some of my men at the gates to ensure that no loads would be brought in on the Sabbath day. 
16Neh 13:20 As a result, the merchants and sellers of all sorts of goods remained outside Jerusalem a couple of times. 
16Neh 13:21 I argued with them, "Why are you staying outside the wall?If you do this again, I'll arrest you." From that time on, they didn't come anymore on the Sabbath. 
16Neh 13:22 Then I commanded the Levites to purify themselves and to come as gate keepers to sanctify the Sabbath day. Remember me, my God, and show mercy to me according to the greatness of your gracious love.
16Neh 13:23 At that time I also noticed that Jews had married women from Ashdod, Ammon, and Moab. 
16Neh 13:24 Furthermore, their children spoke half of the time in the language of Ashdod, and could not speak in the language of Judah. Instead, they spoke in the languages of various peoples. 
16Neh 13:25 So I rebuked them, cursed them, struck some of their men, tore out their hair, and made them take this oath in the name of God£º "You are not to give your daughters to their sons nor take their daughters for your sons or for yourselves. 
16Neh 13:26 Didn't Solomon, king of Israel, sin by doing these things, even though among many nations there was no king like him who was loved by his God, and God made him king over all Israel. Even so, foreign women caused him to sin. 
16Neh 13:27 Should we listen to you and do all of this terrible evil by transgressing against our God to marry foreign wives?" 
16Neh 13:28 One of the sons of Eliashib the high priest's son Joiada was a son-in-law to Sanballat the Horonite, so I drove him away from me.
16Neh 13:29 Remember them, my God, because they have defiled the priesthood and the covenant of the priesthood and the Levites.
16Neh 13:30 I purified them from everything foreign, arranged duties for the priests and the Levites, each to his task, 31and I arranged at the appointed time for the supply of wood, and for the first fruits. Remember me, my God, with favor.

17Est 1:1 This is what happened during the reign of Ahasuerus, the Ahasuerus who ruled over 127 provinces from India to Cush. 
17Est 1:2 At that time King Ahasuerus was ruling from Susa the capital. 
17Est 1:3 In the third year of his reign, he gave a banquet for all his officials and ministers, and the military leaders of Persia and Media, the nobles, and the provincial officials were present. 
17Est 1:4 He displayed the enormous wealth of his kingdom, along with its splendid beauty and greatness for many days - for 180 days in all. 
17Est 1:5 When those days were over, the king held a seven-day banquet in the courtyard of the garden of his palace for all the people who were present in Susa the capital, from the greatest to the least important. 
17Est 1:6 There were curtains of white and blue linen tied with cords of fine linen and purple material to silver rings on marble columns. There were couches of gold and silver on a mosaic pavement of porphyry, marble, mother-of-pearl and other precious stones. 
17Est 1:7 Drinks were served in gold vessels of various kinds, and there was plenty of royal wine because the king was generous. 
17Est 1:8 According to the king's decree the drinking was not compulsory because the king instructed every steward in his house to serve each individual what he desired. 
17Est 1:9 Queen Vashti also held a banquet in the royal palace of King Ahasuerus for the women. 
17Est 1:10 A week later, when the king was under the influence of all that wine, he ordered Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven eunuchs who served King Ahasuerus, 
17Est 1:11 to bring Queen Vashti to the king, wearing the royal crown to display her beauty to the people and the officials for she was lovely to look at. 
17Est 1:12 Queen Vashti refused to come at the king's order that was brought by the eunuchs. Then the king flew into a rage. 
17Est 1:13 The king spoke to the wise men who understood the times, for it was the king's custom to consult all those who understood law and justice. 
17Est 1:14 (His closest advisers were£º Carshena, Shethar, Admatha, Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven officials of Persia and Media who had direct access to the king and who held the highest rank in the kingdom.) 
17Est 1:15 The king inquired, "According to law, what should be done to Queen Vashti because she did not obey the order of King Ahasuerus that was delivered by the eunuchs?" 
17Est 1:16 Then Memucan replied in the presence of the king and his officials, "It is not the king alone whom Vashti has wronged, but rather all of the officials and all of the people who are in the provinces of King Ahasuerus. 
17Est 1:17 When the report about the queen goes out to all the women, it will cause them to despise their husbands. They'll say, 'King Ahasuerus ordered Queen Vashti to be brought before him, but she wouldn't come.' 
17Est 1:18 This very day the wives of the officials of Persia and Media who hear the report about the queen will speak in the same way to all the officials of the king, and there will be more than enough contempt and anger. 
17Est 1:19 If it seems good to the king, let a royal decree go out from him and let it be written in the laws of Persia and Media, which cannot be repealed, that Vashti is never again to enter the presence of King Ahasuerus. Let the king give her royal position to another woman who is better than she. 
17Est 1:20 When the edict of the king that he issues is heard throughout his kingdom - for it's vast - then all the women will give honor to their husbands, from the greatest to the least important."119
17Est 1:21 This seemed like a good idea to the king and his officials, so the king did what Memucan suggested. 
17Est 1:22 He sent letters to all the provinces of the king, written in the script of that province, and to each people in their own language, ordering that every man should be the master in his house and speak the language of his own people. 
17Est 2:1 After this, when the anger of King Ahasuerus had subsided, he remembered Vashti, what she had done, and what had been decreed about her. 
17Est 2:2 Then the young men who attended the king suggested, "Let beautiful young virgins be sought for the king. 
17Est 2:3 Let the king appoint officials in all the provinces of his kingdom to bring all the beautiful young virgins into the harem in Susa the capital. Let them be placed under the care of Hegai, the king's eunuch, who is in charge of the women to give them their beauty treatments. 
17Est 2:4 Then let the young woman who pleases the king rule in place of Vashti." This advice pleased the king, and he did this.
17Est 2:5 In Susa the capital there was a Jewish man from the tribe of Benjamin, Jair's son Mordecai, who was a descendant of Kish's son Shimei the Benjaminite. 
17Est 2:6 He had been taken into captivity from Jerusalem along with the exiles who had been deported with Jeconiah, king of Judah, whom Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon had taken into exile. 
17Est 2:7 Mordecai had raised his cousin Hadassah, or Esther, because she had no father or mother. The young woman had a beautiful figure and was very attractive. When her mother and father died Mordecai had taken her as his daughter. 
17Est 2:8 The king's order and edict was proclaimed, and many young women were brought to Susa the capital under the care of Hegai. Esther was taken to the palace into the care of Hegai, who was in charge of the women. 
17Est 2:9 The young woman pleased him and gained his favor. He quickly provided her beauty treatments and gave her portions of food to her. He also assigned her seven suitable young women from the palace and transferred her and her young women to the best place in the harem. 
17Est 2:10 Esther did not make known her people or heritage because Mordecai had instructed her not to make it known. 
17Est 2:11 Every day Mordecai would walk back and forth in front of the court of the harem to find out about Esther's well-being and what was happening to her.8
17Est 2:12 Each young woman's turn came to go in to King Ahasuerus at the end of the twelve month period, at which time she was treated according to the regulations for women. This process completed the period of her beauty treatments - six months with oil of myrrh and six months with spices and cosmetics for women. 
17Est 2:13 After that the young woman would go in to the king, and whatever she asked for would be given to her to take with her from the harem to the palace. 
17Est 2:14 In the evening she would go into the palace and in the morning she would return to the second harem, into the care of Shaashgaz, the king's eunuch who was in charge of the mistresses. She would not go again to the king unless the king wanted her and she was called for by name. 
17Est 2:15 Now Esther was the daughter of Abihail, who had been Mordecai's uncle. Mordecai had taken Esther in as his own daughter. When her turn came to go in to the king, she did not want anything except what Hegai, the king's eunuch in charge of the harem, advised. Esther found favor with everyone who saw her. 
17Est 2:16 Esther was taken to King Ahasuerus to his royal palace in the tenth month, which is the month Tebet, in the seventh year of his reign.14
17Est 2:17 The king loved Esther more than any of the other women, so he favored her and was kinder to her than he was to any of the other virgins. He put the royal crown on her head and made her queen in place of Vashti. 
17Est 2:18 The king put on a great banquet for all his officials and ministers to honor Esther. He declared a holiday for the provinces and gave generous gifts.217
17Est 2:19 When the virgins were gathered a second time, Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate. 
17Est 2:20 Now Esther had not declared her heritage or her people, just as Mordecai had instructed her, for Esther did what Mordecai told her just as she had done when she was raised by him. 
17Est 2:21 At that time when Mordecai was sitting in the king's gate, Bigthan and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs among those who guarded the threshold, became angry and conspired to assassinate King Ahasuerus. 
17Est 2:22 When Mordecai learned about the plot, he told Queen Esther, and she told the king in Mordecai's name. 
17Est 2:23 After the matter had been fully investigated, Bigthan and Teresh were hanged on a pole, and this was recorded in the Book of the Chronicles in the presence of the king.
17Est 3:1 Sometime later King Ahasuerus promoted Hammedatha the Agagite's son Haman, elevating him to a position above all the other officials who were with him. 
17Est 3:2 All the king's ministers who were in the king's gate would kneel and bow down to Haman, because the king had commanded that Haman be honored in this way. Mordecai, however, would not kneel and would not bow down.
17Est 3:3 The king's ministers who were in the king's gate asked Mordecai, "Why are you disobeying the king's command?" 
17Est 3:4 They asked him this day after day, and he would not listen to them, so they told Haman to see whether or not Mordecai would get away with his disobedience, since he also had told them that he was Jewish. 
17Est 3:5 When Haman saw that Mordecai would not kneel and bow down to him, he flew into a rage. 
17Est 3:6 Because they had told him who the people of Mordecai were, Haman found it unacceptable to kill only Mordecai. So Haman sought to destroy all of Mordecai's people, the Jewish people, who were in all the kingdom of Ahasuerus. 
17Est 3:7 In the twelfth year of the reign of King Ahasuerus, in the first month (the month Nisan), the pur, that is the lot, was cast in Haman's presence to determine the best day and month to carr you this plot. The lot indicated the twelfth month, the month Adar. 
17Est 3:8 Then Haman said to King Ahasuerus, "There is a certain people scattered and divided among the people throughout the provinces of your kingdom. Their laws are different than all the other people, they don't obey the king's laws, and it's not in the king's best interest to leave them alone. 
17Est 3:9 If the king approves, let it be decreed that they're to be destroyed, and I'll measure out 10,000 silver talents and bring it to the king's treasury for those who will do the work."
17Est 3:10 The king removed his signet ring from his hand and gave it to Hammedatha the Agagite's son Haman, the enemy of the Jewish people. 
17Est 3:11 The king said to Haman, "The silver is given to you, along with the people, to do with them as you see fit."
17Est 3:12 The king's scribes were summoned on the thirteenth day of the first month, and all that Haman commanded was written to the regional authorities of the king, to the governors who were over each province, and to the officials of each people. This order was translated in the name of King Ahasuerus into the language of each province and bo re the seal of the king's signet ring. 
17Est 3:13 Letters were sent by couriers to all of the king's provinces to annihilate, to kill, and to destroy all the Jewish people, both young and old, women and children, and to confiscate their goods on a single day - the thirteenth day of the twelfth month of Adar. 
17Est 3:14 A copy of the letter was to be issued as an edict in every province and published to all the people, telling them to be ready for that day. 
17Est 3:15 The couriers went out, urged on by the king's command, and the edict was issued in Susa the capital. The king and Haman sat down to drink, while the city of Susa was thrown into confusion.313
17Est 4:1 W hen Mordecai learned all that had been done, he tore his garments and clothed himself in sackcloth and ashes. He went into the middle of the city and cried out with a loud and bitter cry. 
17Est 4:2 He came as far as the front of the king's gate, because no one was allowed to enter the king's gate clothed in sackcloth. 
17Est 4:3 In every province where the order of the king and his edict reached, among the Jewish people there was great mourning, fasting, weeping, and lamenting, and many lay down on sackcloth and ashes.
17Est 4:4 When Esther's young women and her eunuchs came and told her, the queen was greatly distressed. She sent clothes for Mordecai to put on so he could take off the sackcloth that he had on, but he would not take them. 
17Est 4:5 Then Esther summoned Hathach, one of the king's eunuchs, whom he had assigned to her, and she ordered him to go to Mordecai to find out what was happening and why it was happening. 
17Est 4:6 Hathach went to Mordecai in the city square that was in front of the king's gate. 
17Est 4:7 Mordecai told him everything that had happened and the exact amount of money that Haman had said he would pay into the king's treasury in order to destroy the Jewish people. 
17Est 4:8 Mordecai gave Hathach a copy of the written decree ordering the Jews' destruction that that had been issued in Susa. Mordecai wanted him to show it to Esther, to explain it to her, and then to instruct her to go in to the king to seek his favor and plead with him for her people. 
17Est 4:9 Hathach went and told Esther what Mordecai had said. 
17Est 4:10 Then Esther spoke to Hathach, instructing him to go back to Mordecai with this message£º 
17Est 4:11 "Every servant of the king and every person in the king's provinces knows that for any man or woman who goes to the king in the inner court without being summoned there is only one law - that he be put to death - unless the king holds out the golden scepter to him. Only then he will live. For these last 30 days I've not been su mmoned to come to the king."
17Est 4:12 They reported Esther's message to Mordecai. 
17Est 4:13 Mordecai told them to reply to Esther, "Don't suppose that because you are in the palace, you will escape any more than the other Jewish people. 
17Est 4:14 Indeed, if you are silent at this time, relief and deliverance will come to the Jewish people from another place, but you and your father's family will perish. Who knows but that you were brought to the kingdom for a time like this?" 
17Est 4:15 Then Esther replied to Mordecai, 
17Est 4:16 "Go and gather all the Jewish people who are in Susa and fast for me. Don't eat or drink for three days, night or day. Both I and my young women will also fast in the same way, and then I'll go in to the king, even though it's against the law. And if I perish, I perish."
17Est 4:17 Then Mordecai left and did everything that Esther had ordered him. 
17Est 5:1 On the third day, Esther put on her royal attire and stood in the inner courtyard of the palace in front of the king's quarters. The king was sitting on his royal throne in the throne room, opposite the entrance to the building. 
17Est 5:2 When the king saw Queen Esther standing in the courtyard, she won his favor, and the king extended to Esther the gold scepter that he was holding. Esther approached and touched the top of the scepter. 
17Est 5:3 The king asked her, "What do you want, Queen Esther?What is your request?Even if it's half of the kingdom, it will be given to you."
17Est 5:4 Esther replied, "If it pleases the king, let the king and Haman come today to the banquet I've prepared for him."
17Est 5:5 The king responded, "Bring Haman quickly so we may do what Esther has requested." So the king and Haman went to the banquet that Esther had prepared.5
17Est 5:6 While they were drinking wine, the king asked Esther, "What's your petition?It will be given to you. What's your request?Up to half of the kingdom, and it will be done."
17Est 5:7 Esther answered, "This is my petition and my request£º 
17Est 5:8 If I've found favor with the king and if it pleases the king to grant my petition and to honor my request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I'll prepare for them tomorrow, and then I'll do what the king has said." 
17Est 5:9 Haman went out that day pleased and happy, but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, and that he did not stand up and tremble in his presence, Haman was furious with Mordecai. 
17Est 5:10 Haman restrained himself, went to his house, and sent for his friends and his wife Zeresh. 
17Est 5:11 Then Haman told them about his splendid wealth, the number of his sons, all the ways the king had honored him, and that he had promoted him above all the other officials and ministers of the king.5
17Est 5:12 Then Haman said, "Even Queen Esther brought no one except me with the king to the banquet that she held, and I along with the king have also been invited by her tomorrow. 
17Est 5:13 But all this does not satisfy me every time I see Mordecai the Jew sitting at the king's gate."
17Est 5:14 Then Zeresh his wife and all his friends said, "Have a pole made 75 feet high, and then in the morning speak to the king and have Mordecai hanged on it. Then go with the king to the banquet happy." This advice pleased Haman, and he had the pole made. 
17Est 6:1 That night the king could not sleep, so he gave instructions to bring the book of records, the chronicles, and they were read to the king. 
17Est 6:2 It was found recorded there that Mordecai had reported about Bigthana and Teresh, two of the king's eunuchs who guarded the entrance to the restricted areas of the palace, and that they had conspired to assassinate King Ahasuerus. 
17Est 6:3 So the king asked, "What honor and distinction was bestowed on Mordecai for this?" The young men who served the king answered, "Nothing was done for him." 
17Est 6:4 The king said, "Who is in the courtyard?" Now Haman had just entered the outer courtyard of the palace to speak to the king about having Mordecai hanged on the pole he had set up.
17Est 6:5 The king's young men said to him, "Look, Haman is standing in the courtyard." The king said, "Let him come in."
17Est 6:6 After Haman came in, the king asked him, "What should be done for the man whom the king desires to honor?" Haman said to himself, "Whom would the king desire to honor more than me?" 
17Est 6:7 Haman answered the king, "For a man whom the king desires to honor, 
17Est 6:8 let them bring royal robes that the king has worn and a horse on which the king has ridden, with a royal crown placed on its head. 
17Est 6:9 Then give the robes and the horse to one of the king's most noble officials. Let them put the robes on the man whom the king desires to honor, and let them put him on the horse in the main square of the city. Then let them announce in front of him, 'This is what is done for the man whom the king desires to honor.'" 
17Est 6:10 Then the king said to Haman, "Quick! Take the clothes and the horse just as you have suggested and do this for Mordecai the Jew who sits in the king's gate. And don't let anything you've suggested fall through the cracks."
17Est 6:11 So Haman took the clothes and the horse, dressed Mordecai, and put him on the horse in the main square of the city. He cried out in front of him, "This is what is done for the man whom the king desires to honor." 
17Est 6:12 Then Mordecai returned to the king's gate, while Haman hurried to his house, mourning and hiding his face. 
17Est 6:13 Haman told his wife Zeresh and all his friends everything that had happened to him. His wise friends and his wife Zeresh said to him, "If Mordecai, before whom you have begun to fail, is one of the Jewish people, you won't prevail against him. Instead, you will surely fall before him."6
17Est 6:14 While they were still talking to him, the king's eunuchs arrived, and they quickly took him to the banquet that Esther had prepared. 
17Est 7:1 The king and Haman went in to have a drink with Queen Esther. 
17Est 7:2 On the second day the king again said to Esther as they drank wine, "What's your petition, Queen Esther?It will be given to you. What's your request?Up to half of the kingdom, and it will be done."
17Est 7:3 Queen Esther answered£º "If I've found favor with you, your majesty, and if it seems good to the king, let my life be given to me as my petition and my people as my request. 
17Est 7:4 Indeed, I and my people have been sold to be annihilated, killed, and destroyed. If we had just been sold as male and female slaves, I would have kept quiet, because the trouble wouldn't have been sufficient to bother the king."
17Est 7:5 Then King Ahasuerus asked Queen Esther, "Who is this, and where is the person who would dare do this?"
17Est 7:6 Esther replied, "An adversary and an enemy - it's this wicked Haman!" So Haman was terrified before the king and the queen. 
17Est 7:7 The king got up from the banquet in anger and went out to the palace garden, while Haman stood there begging Queen Esther to spare his life, because he realized that the king intended to harm him.
17Est 7:8 When the king returned to the banquet hall from the palace garden, Haman was prostrate on the couch where Esther was. The king asked, "Will this man even assault the queen with me in the house?" The king had no sooner spoken when they covered Haman's face. 
17Est 7:9 Then Harbonah, one of the eunuchs attending the king, observed, "Look there! A pole is standing 75 feet high at Haman's house that he prepared for Mordecai, whose report benefited the king!" The king said, "Hang him on it." 
17Est 7:10 So they hanged Haman on the pole he had set up for Mordecai, and then the king's anger subsided.7
17Est 8:1 That day King Ahasuerus gave Queen Esther the property of Haman, the enemy of the Jewish people, and Mordecai came into the king's presence because Esther had told him how Mordecai was related to her. 
17Est 8:2 The king took off his signet ring that he had taken from Haman and gave it to Mordecai. Esther then put Mordecai in charge of Haman's property. 
17Est 8:3 Then Esther spoke to the king again and fell at his feet. She wept and pleaded with him for mercy to overturn the evil plan devised by Haman the Agagite and his plot against the Jewish people. 
17Est 8:4 The king extended the golden scepter to Esther, and she got up and stood before the king. 
17Est 8:5 She said, "If it pleases the king, and if I've found favor with him, and if the matter is proper in the king's opinion, and if I'm pleasing to the king, let an order be issued revoking the letters devised by Hammedatha the Agagite's son Haman, which ordered the destruction of the Jewish people throughout the king's provinces. 
17Est 8:6 Indeed, how can I bear to see this disaster happen to my people?How can I bear to see the destruction of my kinsmen?" 
17Est 8:7 King Ahasuerus said to Queen Esther and Mordecai the Jew, "Look, I've given Haman's property to Esther, and they have hanged him on the pole because he tried to harm the Jewish people. 
17Est 8:8 Now, in the name of the king, you write what seems good to you concerning the Jewish people, and seal it with the king's signet ring, for a document written in the king's name and sealed with the king's signet ring cannot be revoked."7
17Est 8:9 The king's scribes were summoned at that time, on the twenty-third day of the third month, which is the month Sivan, and everything that Mordecai commanded the Jewish people, the regional authorities, the governors, and the provincial officials of the 127 provinces from India to Cush was written down for each province according to its script, for each people according to their language, and for the Jewish people according to their script and language. 
17Est 8:10 He wrote in the name of King Ahasuerus and sealed it with the king's signet ring. He sent the letters by couriers on horseback, riding steeds especially bred for the king. 
17Est 8:11 What the king granted the Jewish people in every town was the right to assemble and defend themselves, to annihilate, kill, and destroy every armed force of a people or a province that was hostile to them, including children and women, and to plunder their property. 
17Est 8:12 Throughout all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, the one day for the Jewish people to do this was the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar. 
17Est 8:13 A copy of the document was to be issued as law in each and every province and published for all people, indicating that the Jewish people were to be ready to take vengeance on their enemies on that day. 
17Est 8:14 The couriers, mounted on the royal steeds, left quickly, urged on by the king's command. The edict was also issued in Susa the capital. 
17Est 8:15 Mordecai left the king's presence in royal robes of blue and white, wearing a large golden crown and a purple robe made of fine linen; and the city of Susa shouted with joy. 
17Est 8:16 For the Jewish people, there was light and joy, gladness and honor. 
17Est 8:17 In each and every province, and in each and every city, in the places where the king's order and edict reached, there was gladness and joy among the Jewish people, along with a feast and a holiday. Many of the people of the land became Jews, because they had come to fear the Jewish people.
17Est 9:1 On the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the month Adar, when the king's order and edict was about to be carried out, on the day when the enemies of the Jewish people expected to prevail over them, things were turned around so that the Jewish people themselves prevailed over those who hated them.
17Est 9:2 The Jewish people assembled in their towns throughout the provinces of King Ahasuerus to strike out against those who intended to harm them, and no one could oppose them because all the people had come to fear the Jews. 
17Est 9:3 All the provincial officials, the regional authorities, the governors, and those doing the king's work supported the Jewish people because the fear of Mordecai had come over them. 
17Est 9:4 Indeed, Mordecai was a powerful official in the palace and his fame spread throughout the provinces. Indeed, the man Mordecai grew more and more powerful. 
17Est 9:5 The Jewish people struck down all their enemies with the sword, killing and destroying them, and they did with their enemies as they pleased. 
17Est 9:6 In Susa the capital the Jewish people killed and destroyed 500 people. 
17Est 9:7 They killed Parshandatha, Dalphon, Aspatha, 
17Est 9:8 Poratha, Adalia, Aridatha, 
17Est 9:9 Parmashta, Arisai, Aridai, and Vaizatha, 
17Est 9:10 the ten sons of Hammedatha's son Haman, the enemy of the Jewish people, but they did not lay their hands on the spoils. 
17Est 9:11 On that day the number of those slain in Susa the capital was reported to the king. 
17Est 9:12 The king said to Queen Esther, "In Susa the capital the Jewish people have killed and destroyed 500 people, including Haman's ten sons. What have they done in the rest of the king's provinces?Now what's your petition?It will be given to you. What's your further request?It will be done." 
17Est 9:13 Then Esther said, "If it pleases the king, let it also be granted to the Jewish people in Susa to do tomorrow what the edict allowed them to do today, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged on poles."
17Est 9:14 The king said, "Let this be done." So an edict was issued in Susa, and Haman's ten sons were hanged on poles. 
17Est 9:15 The Jewish people in Susa assembled again on that day, the fourteenth of Adar, and they killed 300 people in Susa, but they did not lay their hands on the spoils. 
17Est 9:16 The rest of the Jewish people in the king's provinces assembled to defend themselves, and they gained relief from their enemies, killing 75,000 of those who hated them. But they did not lay their hands on the spoils. 
17Est 9:17 They did this on the thirteenth day of Adar and rested on the fourteenth day, making it a day of feasting and joy. 
17Est 9:18 The Jewish people in Susa assembled on the thirteenth day and again on the fourteenth, and then rested on the fifteenth day and made it a day of feasting and joy. 
17Est 9:19 Therefore the Jewish people in the rural areas who live in unwalled towns make the fourteenth day of the month Adar a holiday for joy and feasting, and people send presents to one another. 
17Est 9:20 Mordecai wrote these instructions and sent letters to all the Jewish people in all the provinces of King Ahasuerus, both near and far, 
17Est 9:21 establishing that they should celebrate the fourteenth and fifteenth days of the month Adar every year, 
17Est 9:22 as the days on which the Jewish people enjoyed relief from their enemies. It was a month when things turned around for them, from sorrow to joy and from mourning to a holiday. They were to celebrate these days as days of feasting and joy, and they were to send presents to one another and gifts to the poor. 
17Est 9:23 So the Jewish people made a tradition out of what they had begun to do and of what Mordecai had written to them, 
17Est 9:24 since Hammedatha's son Haman, the enemy of the Jewish people, had plotted against the Jewish people to destroy them, and he had cast the pur,thatis,thelot,todeterminewhen to confuse and destroy them.
17Est 9:25 But when Esther came before the king, he ordered through a letter that the evil plot that Haman had devised against the Jewish people be rescinded, and that he and his sons be hanged on poles. 
17Est 9:26 Therefore these days were called Purim, from the word pur. Because of all that was written in this letter, because of what they experienced in this matter, and because of what happened to them,
17Est 9:27 the Jewish people established this celebration, making it a tradition for themselves, for their descendants, and for all who joined with them that they should not fail to observe these two days each year, based on the written instructions, and at the prescribed time. 
17Est 9:28 These days should be remembered and observed in every generation by each family in every province and town. These days of Purim should not be neglected by the Jewish people, and that they should not be forgotten by their descendants.9
17Est 9:29 Queen Esther, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai the Jew wrote with full authority confirming this second letter about Purim. 
17Est 9:30 Letters containing wishes for peace and stability were sent to all the Jewish people, to the 127 provinces of Ahasuerus' kingdom, 
17Est 9:31 establishing these days of Purim at the prescribed time, just as Mordecai the Jew and Queen Esther had established, and just as the Jewish people had established for themselves and for their descendants. The letter included instructions for their fasting and lamentations. 
17Est 9:32 The order of Esther established these instructions for Purim, and it was officially recorded.
17Est 10:1 King Ahasuerus imposed tribute on the land and on the islands of the sea. 
17Est 10:2 Now as to all the powerful and great deeds of Ahasuerus, along with an exact statement about the high position of Mordecai to which the king promoted him, these things are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Media and Persia, are they not?
17Est 10:3 Indeed, Mordecai the Jew was second in authority only to King Ahasuerus and was a powerful official among the Jewish people. Mordecai was accepted favorably by his many kinsmen, and he sought the good of his countrymen and spoke out for the welfare of all his people.2
