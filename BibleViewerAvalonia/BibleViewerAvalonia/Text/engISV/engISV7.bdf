44Ac 1:1 In my first book, Theophilus, I wrote about everything Jesus did and taught from the beginning,
44Ac 1:2 up to the day when he was taken up to heaven after giving orders by the Holy Spirit to the apostles he had chosen.
44Ac 1:3 After he had suffered, he had shown himself alive to them by many convincing proofs, appearing to them during a period of 40 days and telling them about the kingdom of God. 
44Ac 1:4 While he was meeting with them, he ordered them, "Don't leave Jerusalem. Instead, wait for what the Father has promised, about which you heard me speak.
44Ac 1:5 For John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit a few days from now." 
44Ac 1:6 Now those who had gathered together began to ask Jesus, "Lord, is this the time when you will restore the kingdom to Israel?"
44Ac 1:7 He answered them, "It is not for you to know what times or periods the Father has fixed by his own authority.
44Ac 1:8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes on you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, in all Judea and Samaria, and to the ends of the earth." 
44Ac 1:9 After saying this, Jesus was taken up while those who had gathered together were watching, and a cloud took him out of their sight.
44Ac 1:10 While he was going and they were gazing up toward heaven, two men in white robes stood right beside them.
44Ac 1:11 They asked, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking up toward heaven? This same Jesus, who has been taken up from you into heaven, will come back in the same way you saw him go up into heaven." 
44Ac 1:12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the Mount of Olives, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
44Ac 1:13 When they came into the city, these men went to the upstairs room where they had been staying£º Peter and John, James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot, and Judas the son of James.
44Ac 1:14 With one mind all of them kept devoting themselves to prayer, along with the women, including Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers. 
44Ac 1:15 At that time Peter got up among the brothers (there were about 120 people present) and said,
44Ac 1:16 "Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke long ago through the voice of David about Judas, who was the guide for those who arrested Jesus,
44Ac 1:17 because he was one of our number and was appointed to share in this ministry."
44Ac 1:18 (Now this man bought a field with the money he got for his crime. Falling on his face, he burst open in the middle, and all his intestines gushed out.
44Ac 1:19 This became known to all the residents of Jerusalem, so that this field is called in their language Hakeldama, that is, "The Field of Blood".)
44Ac 1:20 "For in the Book of Psalms it is written, 'Let his estate be desolate, and let no one live on it,' and 'Let someone else take over his office,'
44Ac 1:21 who was one of the men associated with us all the time the Lord Jesus came and went among us,
44Ac 1:22 beginning when he was baptized by John until the day he was taken up from us. Therefore, someone like this must become a witness with us to his resurrection." 
44Ac 1:23 So they nominated two men - Joseph called Barsabbas, who also was called Justus, and Matthias.
44Ac 1:24 Then they prayed, "Lord, you know the hearts of all people. Show us which one of these two men you have chosen
44Ac 1:25 to serve in this office of apostle, from which Judas left to go to his own place."
44Ac 1:26 So they drew lots for them, and when the lot fell on Matthias, he was enrolled with the eleven apostles.
44Ac 2:1 When the day of Pentecost was being celebrated, all of them were together in one place.
44Ac 2:2 Suddenly, a sound like the roar of a mighty windstorm came from heaven and filled the whole house where they were sitting.
44Ac 2:3 They saw tongues like flames of fire that separated, and one rested on each of them.
44Ac 2:4 All of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other languages as the Spirit gave them that ability. 
44Ac 2:5 Now devout Jews from every nation were living in Jerusalem.
44Ac 2:6 When that sound came, a crowd quickly gathered, startled because each one heard the disciples speaking in his own language.
44Ac 2:7 Stunned and amazed, they asked, "All of these people who are speaking are Galileans, aren't they - 
44Ac 2:8 So how is it that each one of us hears them speaking in his own native language£º
44Ac 2:9 Parthians, Medes, Elamites, residents of Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontus, Asia,
44Ac 2:10 Phrygia, Pamphylia, Egypt, the district of Libya near Cyrene, Jewish and proselyte visitors from Rome,
44Ac 2:11 Cretans, and Arabs, listening to them talk in our own languages about the great deeds of God?"
44Ac 2:12 All of them continued to be stunned and puzzled, and they kept asking one another, "What can this mean?"
44Ac 2:13 But others kept saying in derision, "They're drunk on sweet wine!"
44Ac 2:14 Then Peter stood up among the eleven apostles and raised his voice to address them£º "Men of Judea and everyone living in Jerusalem! You must understand something, so pay close attention to my words.
44Ac 2:15 These men are not drunk as you suppose, for it's only nine o'clock in the morning.
44Ac 2:16 Rather, this is what was spoken through the prophet Joel£º
44Ac 2:17 'In the last days, God says, I will pour out my Spirit on everyone. Your sons and your daughters will prophesy, your young men will see visions, and your old men will dream dreams.
44Ac 2:18 In those days I will even pour out my Spirit on my slaves, men and women alike, and they will prophesy.
44Ac 2:19 I will display wonders in the sky above and signs on the earth below£º blood, fire, and clouds of smoke.
44Ac 2:20 The sun will become dark, and the moon turn to blood, before the coming of the great and glorious Day of the Lord.
44Ac 2:21 Then whoever calls on the name of the Lord will be saved.'
44Ac 2:22 "Fellow Israelites, listen to these words£º Jesus from Nazareth was a man authenticated to you by God through miracles, wonders, and signs that God performed through him among you, as you yourselves know.
44Ac 2:23 After he was arrested according to the predetermined plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified this very man and killed him by the hands of lawless men.
44Ac 2:24 But God raised him up and put an end to suffering of death, since it was impossible for him to be held by it.
44Ac 2:25 For David says about him, 'I always keep my eyes on the Lord, for he is at my right hand so that I cannot be shaken.
44Ac 2:26 That is why my heart is glad and my tongue rejoices, yes, even my body still rests securely in hope.
44Ac 2:27 For you will not abandon my soul to Hades or allow your Holy One to experience decay.
44Ac 2:28 You have made the ways of life known to me, and you will fill me with gladness in your presence.'
44Ac 2:29 "Brothers, I can tell you confidently that the patriarch David died and was buried, and that his tomb is among us to this day.
44Ac 2:30 Therefore, since he was a prophet and knew that God had promised him with an oath to put one of his descendants on his throne,
44Ac 2:31 he looked ahead and spoke about the resurrection of the Messiah£º 'He was not abandoned to Hades, and his flesh did not experience decay.'
44Ac 2:32 "It was this very Jesus whom God raised, and of that we are all witnesses.
44Ac 2:33 He has been exalted to the right hand of God, has received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit, and has caused you to experience what you are seeing and hearing.
44Ac 2:34 For David did not go up to heaven, but he said, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
44Ac 2:35 until I make your enemies your footstool."'
44Ac 2:36 "Therefore, let all the people of Israel understand beyond a doubt that God made this Jesus, whom you crucified, both Lord and Messiah!"
44Ac 2:37 When the crowd that had gathered heard this, they were pierced to the heart. They asked Peter and the other apostles, "Brothers, what should we do?" 
44Ac 2:38 Peter answered them, "Every one of you must repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus the Messiah for the forgiveness of your sins. Then you will receive the Holy Spirit as a gift.
44Ac 2:39 For this promise belongs to you and your children, as well as to all those who are distant, whom the Lord our God may call to himself." 
44Ac 2:40 Using many different expressions, Peter continued to testify and to plead with them, saying, "Be saved from this corrupt generation!"
44Ac 2:41 So those who welcomed his message were baptized. That day about 3,000 people were added to their number.
44Ac 2:42 The believers continued to devote themselves to what the apostles were teaching, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to times of prayer.
44Ac 2:43 A sense of fear came over everyone, and many wonders and signs were being done by the apostles.
44Ac 2:44 All the believers were united and shared everything with one another.
44Ac 2:45 They made it their practice to sell their possessions and goods and to distribute the proceeds to anyone who was in need.
44Ac 2:46 United in purpose, they went to the temple every day, ate at each other's homes, and shared their food with glad and humble hearts.
44Ac 2:47 They were praising God and enjoying the good will of all the people. Every day the Lord was adding to their number those who were being saved.
44Ac 3:1 One afternoon, Peter and John were on their way to the temple for the three o'clock prayer time.
44Ac 3:2 Now a man who had been crippled from birth was being carried in. Every day people would lay him at what was called the Beautiful Gate so that he could beg from those who were going into the temple.
44Ac 3:3 When he saw that Peter and John were about to go into the temple, he asked them to give him something.2
44Ac 3:4 Peter, along with John, looked him straight in the eye and said, "Look at us!"
44Ac 3:5 So the man watched them closely, expecting to get something from them.
44Ac 3:6 However, Peter said, "I don't have any silver or gold, but I'll give you what I do have. In the name of Jesus the Messiah from Nazareth, walk!"
44Ac 3:7 Then Peter took hold of his right hand and began to help him up. Immediately his feet and ankles became strong,
44Ac 3:8 and he sprang to his feet, stood up, and began to walk. Then he went with them into the temple, walking, jumping, and praising God. 
44Ac 3:9 When all the people saw him walking and praising God,
44Ac 3:10 they knew that he was the man who used to sit and beg at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, and they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. 
44Ac 3:11 While he was holding on to Peter and John, all the people came running to them in what was called "Solomon's Colonnade". They were dumbfounded.
44Ac 3:12 When Peter saw this, he said to the people£º "Fellow Israelites, why are you wondering about this, and why are you staring at us as if by our own power or godliness we made him walk - 
44Ac 3:13 The God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob - the God of our ancestors - has glorified his servant Jesus, whom you betrayed and rejected in the presence of Pilate, even though he had decided to let him go.
44Ac 3:14 You rejected the Holy and Righteous One and asked to have a murderer released to you,
44Ac 3:15 and you killed the source of life, whom God raised from the dead. We are witnesses to that.
44Ac 3:16 It is his name - that is, by faith in his name - that has healed this man whom you see and know. Yes, the faith that comes through Jesus has given him this perfect health in the presence of all of you.11
44Ac 3:17 "And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance like your leaders.
44Ac 3:18 This is how God fulfilled what he had predicted through the voice of all the prophets - that his Messiah would suffer.
44Ac 3:19 Therefore, repent and turn to him to have your sins blotted out,
44Ac 3:20 so that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord and so that he may send you Jesus, whom he appointed long ago to be the Messiah.
44Ac 3:21 He must remain in heaven until the time of universal restitution, which God announced long ago through the voice of his holy prophets.
44Ac 3:22 In fact, Moses said, 'The Lord your God will raise up for you a prophet like me from among your brothers. You must listen to everything he tells you.
44Ac 3:23 Any person who will not listen to that prophet will be utterly destroyed from among the people.'
44Ac 3:24 "Indeed, all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who followed him, also announced these days.
44Ac 3:25 You are the descendants of the prophets and the heirs of the covenant that God made with your ancestors when he said to Abraham, 'Through your descendant all the families of the earth will be blessed.'
44Ac 3:26 When God raised up his servant, he sent him first to you to bless you by turning every one of you from your evil ways."
44Ac 4:1 While they were speaking to the people, the priests, the commander of the temple guards, and the Sadducees came to them.
44Ac 4:2 They were greatly disturbed that Peter and John were teaching the people and announcing that Jesus had been resurrected from the dead.
44Ac 4:3 So they arrested them and placed them in custody until the next day, since it was already evening.
44Ac 4:4 But many of those who heard their message believed, and the men grew to number about 5,000.
44Ac 4:5 The next day their rulers, elders, and scribes met in Jerusalem
44Ac 4:6 with Annas the high priest, Caiaphas, John, Alexander, and the rest of the high priest's family.
44Ac 4:7 They made Peter and John stand in front of them and began asking, "By what power or by what name did you do this?" 
44Ac 4:8 Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers and elders of the people!
44Ac 4:9 If we are being questioned today for a good deed done for someone who was sick or to learn how this man was healed,
44Ac 4:10 you and all the people of Israel must understand that this man stands healthy before you because of the name of Jesus from Nazareth, whom you crucified but God raised from the dead.
44Ac 4:11 He is 'the stone that was rejected by you builders, which has become the cornerstone.'
44Ac 4:12 There is no salvation by anyone else, for there is no other name under heaven given among people by which we must be saved." 
44Ac 4:13 Now when the Jewish leaders saw the boldness of Peter and John and found out that they were uneducated and ordinary men, they were amazed and realized that they had been with Jesus.
44Ac 4:14 And seeing the man who was healed standing with them, they could not say anything against them.
44Ac 4:15 So they ordered them to leave the Council and began to discuss the matter among themselves.
44Ac 4:16 They said, "What should we do with these men? For it's obvious to everybody living in Jerusalem that an unmistakable sign has been done by them, and we cannot deny it.
44Ac 4:17 But to keep it from spreading any further among the people, let us warn them never again to speak to anyone in this name."
44Ac 4:18 So they called Peter and John back in and ordered them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
44Ac 4:19 But Peter and John answered them, "You must decide whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than God,
44Ac 4:20 for we cannot stop talking about what we've seen and heard." 
44Ac 4:21 So they threatened Peter and John even more and then let them go. They couldn't find any way to punish them, because all the people were praising God for what had happened.
44Ac 4:22 For the man on whom this sign of healing had been performed was more than40 years old.
44Ac 4:23 After they were released, Peter and John went to their fellow believers and told them everything the high priests and the elders had said.
44Ac 4:24 When they heard this, they all raised their voices to God and said, "Master, you made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them.
44Ac 4:25 You said by the Holy Spirit through the voice of our ancestor, your servant David, 'Why do the gentiles rage, and the people devise useless plots?
44Ac 4:26 The kings of the earth take their stand, and rulers meet together against the Lord and against his Messiah.'
44Ac 4:27 For in this city both Herod and Pontius Pilate actually met together with the gentiles and the people of Israel to oppose your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed,
44Ac 4:28 to carry out everything that your hand and will had predetermined to take place.
44Ac 4:29 Lord, pay attention to their threats now, and allow your servants to speak your word boldly
44Ac 4:30 as you stretch out your hand to heal and to perform signs and wonders through the name of your holy servant Jesus." 
44Ac 4:31 When they had prayed, the place where they were meeting was shaken, and all of them were filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God boldly. 
44Ac 4:32 Now all the believers were one in heart and soul, and nobody called any of his possessions his own. Instead, they shared everything they owned.
44Ac 4:33 With great power the apostles continued to testify to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and abundant grace was on them all.
44Ac 4:34 For none of them needed anything, because everyone who had land or houses would sell them and bring the money received for the things sold
44Ac 4:35 and lay it at the apostles' feet. Then it was distributed to anyone who needed it.
44Ac 4:36 One man, Joseph, a Levite and a native of Cyprus, who was named Barnabas by the apostles (the name means "a son of encouragement"),
44Ac 4:37 sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.364
44Ac 5:1 But a man named Ananias, with the consent of his wife Sapphira, sold some property.
44Ac 5:2 With his wife's full knowledge he kept back some of the money for himself and brought the remainder and laid it at the apostles' feet. 
44Ac 5:3 Peter asked, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart so that you should lie to the Holy Spirit and keep back some of the money you got for the land?
44Ac 5:4 As long as it remained unsold, wasn't it your own? And after it was sold, wasn't the money at your disposal? So how could you have thought of doing what you did? You didn't lie only to men, but also to God!"
44Ac 5:5 When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and died. And great fear seized everyone who heard about it.
44Ac 5:6 The young men got up, wrapped him up, carried him outside, and buried him. 
44Ac 5:7 After an interval of about three hours, Ananias' wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
44Ac 5:8 So Peter asked her, "Tell me, did you sell the land for that price?"She answered, "Yes, that was the price."
44Ac 5:9 "How could you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord?" Peter asked her. "Listen! The feet of the men who buried your husband are at the door, and these men will carry you outside as well."
44Ac 5:10 She instantly fell down at Peter's feet and died. When the young men came in, they found her dead. So they carried her out and buried her next to her husband.
44Ac 5:11 And great fear seized the whole church and everyone else who heard about this. 
44Ac 5:12 Now many signs and wonders were being performed by the apostles among the people, who were gathered together in Solomon's Colonnade.
44Ac 5:13 None of the others dared join them, although the rest of the people continued to hold them in high regard.
44Ac 5:14 Nevertheless, believers were being added to the Lord in increasing numbers - both men and women.
44Ac 5:15 As a result, people kept carrying their sick into the streets and placing them on stretchers and mats so that at least Peter's shadow might fall on some of them as he went by.
44Ac 5:16 Even from the towns around Jerusalem crowds continued coming in to bring their sick and those who were troubled by unclean spirits, and all of them were healed. 
44Ac 5:17 Then the high priest and all those from the sect of the Sadducees who were with him were filled with jealousy. So they went out,
44Ac 5:18 arrested the apostles, and put them in the city jail.
44Ac 5:19 But at night the angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and led them out. The angel told them,
44Ac 5:20 "Go, stand in the temple, and keep on telling the people the whole message about this life they can have."
44Ac 5:21 After the apostles heard this, they went into the temple at daybreak and began to teach. The high priest and those who were with him arrived, called the Council and all the elders of Israel together, and sent word to the prison to have the men brought in.
44Ac 5:22 When the temple police got there, they did not find them in the prison. They came back and reported,
44Ac 5:23 "We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them, we found no one inside."
44Ac 5:24 When the commander of the temple guards and the high priests heard these words, they were utterly at a loss as to what could have happened to them.21
44Ac 5:25 Then someone came and told them, "Look! The men you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people!"
44Ac 5:26 So the commander of the temple guards went with his men to bring them back without force, because they were afraid of being stoned to death by the people.
44Ac 5:27 When they brought them back, they made them stand before the Council, and the high priest began to question them.
44Ac 5:28 He said, "We gave you strict orders not to teach in his name, didn't we? Yet you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching and are determined to bring this man's blood on us!"
44Ac 5:29 But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men.
44Ac 5:30 The God of our ancestors raised Jesus to life after you killed him by hanging him on a tree.
44Ac 5:31 God has exalted to his right hand this very man as our Leader and Savior in order to extend repentance and forgiveness of sins to Israel.
44Ac 5:32 We are witnesses of these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who keep on obeying him."
44Ac 5:33 When the Council heard this, they became furious and wanted to kill them.
44Ac 5:34 But a Pharisee named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law who was respected by all the people, stood up in the Council and ordered the men to be taken outside for a little while.
44Ac 5:35 Then he said to them, "Fellow Israelites, consider carefully what you propose to do to these men.
44Ac 5:36 For in the recent past Theudas appeared, claiming that he was important, and about 400 men joined him. He was killed, and all his followers were dispersed and disappeared.
44Ac 5:37 After that man, at the time of the census, Judas the Galilean appeared and got people to follow him. He, too, died, and all his followers were scattered.
44Ac 5:38 "I'm telling you to keep away from these men for now. Leave them alone, because if this plan or movement is of human origin, it will fail.
44Ac 5:39 However, if it is from God, you won't be able to stop them, and you may even discover that you are fighting against God!" So they were convinced by him. 
44Ac 5:40 After calling in the apostles and beating them, they again ordered them to stop speaking in the name of Jesus and let them go.
44Ac 5:41 They left the Council, rejoicing to have been considered worthy to suffer dishonor for the sake of the Name.
44Ac 5:42 Every day in the temple and from house to house they kept teaching and proclaiming that Jesus is the Messiah.
44Ac 6:1 In those days, as the number of the disciples was growing larger and larger, a complaint was made by the Hellenistic Jews against the Hebraic Jews that their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution of food.
44Ac 6:2 So the twelve men called the whole group of disciples together and said, "It is not desirable for us to neglect the word of God in order to wait on tables.
44Ac 6:3 Therefore, brothers, appoint seven men among you who have a good reputation, who are full of the Spirit and wisdom, and we will put them in charge of this work.
44Ac 6:4 Then we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word." 
44Ac 6:5 This suggestion pleased the whole group. So they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and the Holy Spirit, Philip, Prochorus, Nicanor, Timon, Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a gentile convert to Judaism from Antioch.
44Ac 6:6 They had these men stand before the apostles, who prayed and laid their hands on them. 
44Ac 6:7 So the word of God continued to spread, and the number of disciples in Jerusalem continued to grow rapidly. Even a large number of priests became obedient to the faith. 
44Ac 6:8 Now Stephen, full of grace and power, was performing great wonders and signs among the people.
44Ac 6:9 But some men who belonged to the Synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), as well as some Cyrenians, Alexandrians, and men from Cilicia and Asia, stood up and began to debate with Stephen.
44Ac 6:10 But they could neither refute the wisdom nor withstand the Spirit by which he kept speaking.
44Ac 6:11 So they secretly got some men to say, "We have heard him speaking blasphemous words against Moses and God."
44Ac 6:12 They stirred up the people, the elders, and the scribes. Then they rushed at Stephen, grabbed him, and brought him before the Council.
44Ac 6:13 They had false witnesses stand up and say, "This man never stops saying things against this Holy Place and against the law.
44Ac 6:14 For we have heard him say that this Jesus from Nazareth will destroy this place and change the customs that Moses handed down to us."
44Ac 6:15 Then everyone who was seated in the Council glared at him and saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
44Ac 7:1 Then the high priest asked, "Is this true?"
44Ac 7:2 Stephen replied£º "Listen, brothers and fathers! "The glorious God appeared to our ancestor Abraham while he was in Mesopotamia before he settled in Haran.
44Ac 7:3 God said to him, 'Leave your country and your relatives and go to the land I will show you.'
44Ac 7:4 So he left the country of the Chaldeans and settled in Haran. Then after the death of his father, God had him move to this country where you now live.
44Ac 7:5 God gave him no property here, not even a foot of land, yet he promised to give it to him and to his descendants after him as a permanent possession, even though he had no child.
44Ac 7:6 "This is what God promised£º His descendants would be strangers in a foreign country, and its people would enslave them and oppress them for40 0 years.
44Ac 7:7 'But I will punish the nation they serve,' said God, 'and afterwards they will leave and worship me in this place.'
44Ac 7:8 Later, God gave Abraham the covenant of circumcision. Later, he fathered Isaac and circumcised him on the eighth day. Then Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered the twelve patriarchs.
44Ac 7:9 "Joseph's brothers became jealous of him and sold Joseph as a slave in Egypt. However, God was with him
44Ac 7:10 and rescued him from all his troubles. He granted him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who appointed him ruler of Egypt and of his whole household.
44Ac 7:11 "But a famine spread throughout Egypt and Canaan, and with it great suffering, and our ancestors couldn't find any food.
44Ac 7:12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent our ancestors on their first trip.
44Ac 7:13 On their second trip, Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph introduced his family to Pharaoh.
44Ac 7:14 Then Joseph invited his father Jacob and all his relatives to come to him in Egypt - 75 persons in all.
44Ac 7:15 So Jacob went down to Egypt. Then he and our ancestors died.
44Ac 7:16 They were brought back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought at a high price from Hamor's descendants in Shechem.
44Ac 7:17 "Now as the time approached for the fulfillment of the promise that God had made to Abraham, the people's population increased a great deal in Egypt.
44Ac 7:18 Eventually, a different king who had not known Joseph became ruler of Egypt.
44Ac 7:19 By shrewdly scheming against our people, he oppressed our ancestors and forced them to abandon their infants to the elements, so that they wouldn't live. 
44Ac 7:20 "At this time Moses was born. He was beautiful in the sight of God, and for three months he was cared for in his father's house.
44Ac 7:21 When he was placed outside, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.
44Ac 7:22 So Moses learned all the wisdom of the Egyptians and became a great man, both in words and in deeds. 
44Ac 7:23 "When he was 40 years old, he decided to visit his brothers, the descendants of Israel.
44Ac 7:24 When he saw one of them being mistreated, he defended him and avenged the man who was being mistreated by killing the Egyptian.
44Ac 7:25 He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was using him to rescue them, but they didn't understand.
44Ac 7:26 The next day he presented himself to some of them while they were fighting and tried to reconcile them. He said, 'Men, you are brothers. Why should you be hurting another?'
44Ac 7:27 "But the man who was harming his neighbor pushed Moses away and said, 'Who made you ruler and judge over us - 
44Ac 7:28 You don't want to kill me like you killed the Egyptian yesterday, do you?'
44Ac 7:29 Because of this, Moses fled and lived as a foreigner in the land of Midian. There he had two sons. 
44Ac 7:30 "After 40 years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the flames of a burning bush in the desert near Mount Sinai.
44Ac 7:31 When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and when he approached the bush to look at it, the voice of the Lord said,
44Ac 7:32 'I am the God of your ancestors - the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.' Moses became terrified and didn't dare to look.
44Ac 7:33 Then the Lord said to him, 'Remove your sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
44Ac 7:34 I have surely seen the oppression of my people in Egypt and have heard their groans, and I have come down to rescue them. Now come, I will send you to Egypt.'
44Ac 7:35 "This same Moses - whom they rejected by saying 'Who made you ruler and judge?' - was the man whom God sent to be both their ruler and deliverer with the help of the angel who had appeared to him in the bush.
44Ac 7:36 It was he who led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt, at the Red Sea, and in the wilderness for40 years.
44Ac 7:37 It was this Moses who told the Israelites, 'God will raise up a prophet for you from among your own brothers, just as he did me.'
44Ac 7:38 This Moses is the one who was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him on Mount Sinai and to our ancestors. He received living truths to give to us,
44Ac 7:39 but our ancestors refused to obey him. Instead, they rejected him and wished to return to Egypt.
44Ac 7:40 They said to Aaron, 'Make gods for us who will lead us. This Moses who led us out of the land of Egypt - we don't know what happened to him!'
44Ac 7:41 "At that time they even made a calf to be their idol, offered a sacrifice to it, and delighted in what they had made with their hands.
44Ac 7:42 So God turned away from them and gave them over to worship the heavenly bodies. As it is written in the book of the Prophets£º 'O house of Israel, you didn't offer me slaughtered animals and sacrifices those 40 years in the wilderness, did you?
44Ac 7:43 You even took along the tent of Moloch, the star of your god Rephan, and the images you made in order to worship them. So I will take you into exile as far as Babylon.'
44Ac 7:44 "Our ancestors had the Tent of Testimony in the wilderness constructed, just as the one who spoke to Moses directed him to make it according to the pattern he had seen.
44Ac 7:45 Our ancestors brought it here with Joshua when they replaced the nations that God drove out in front of our ancestors, and it was here until the time of David.
44Ac 7:46 He found favor with God and asked to design a dwelling for the house of Jacob,
44Ac 7:47 but it was Solomon who built a house for him.
44Ac 7:48 However, the Most High does not live in buildings made by human hands. As the prophet says, 
44Ac 7:49 "'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house can you build for me,' declares the Lord, "or what place is there in which I can rest?
44Ac 7:50 It was my hand that made all these things, wasn't it?'"
44Ac 7:51 "You stubborn people with uncircumcised hearts and ears! You are always opposing the Holy Spirit, just as your ancestors used to do.
44Ac 7:52 Which of the prophets did your ancestors fail to persecute? They killed those who predicted the coming of the Righteous One, and now you have become his betrayers and murderers.
44Ac 7:53 You received the law as ordained by angels, and yet you haven't obeyed it!" 
44Ac 7:54 While they were listening to these things, they became more and more furious and began to grind their teeth at him.
44Ac 7:55 But Stephen, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked straight into heaven and saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
44Ac 7:56 He said, "Look! I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God!"755
44Ac 7:57 But they shouted out loud, stopped listening, and together they all rushed at him,
44Ac 7:58 ran him outside of the city, and began to stone him to death. Meanwhile, the witnesses laid their coats at the feet of a young man named Saul.
44Ac 7:59 As they continued to stone Stephen, he kept praying, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit!"
44Ac 7:60 Then he knelt down and cried out with a loud voice, "Lord, don't hold this sin against them!" After he had said this, he died.
44Ac 8:1 Now Saul heartily approved of putting Stephen to death. That day a severe persecution broke out against the church in Jerusalem, and everyone except for the apostles was scattered throughout the countryside of Judea and Samaria.
44Ac 8:2 Devout men buried Stephen as they mourned loudly for him.
44Ac 8:3 But Saul kept trying to destroy the church. Going into one house after another, he began dragging off men and women and throwing them in prison. 
44Ac 8:4 Now those who were scattered went from place to place preaching the word.
44Ac 8:5 Philip went down to the city of Samaria and began to preach the Messiah to the people.
44Ac 8:6 The crowds, hearing his message and seeing the signs that he was doing, paid close attention to what was said by Philip.
44Ac 8:7 Unclean spirits screamed with a loud voice as they came out of the many people they had possessed, and many paralyzed and lame people were healed.
44Ac 8:8 As a result, there was great rejoicing in that city.
44Ac 8:9 Now in that city there was a man named Simon. He was practicing occult arts and thrilling the people of Samaria, claiming to be someone great.
44Ac 8:10 Everyone from the least to the greatest paid close attention to him, saying, "This is what we call the great power of God!"
44Ac 8:11 They paid careful attention to him because he had thrilled them for a long time with his occult performances.
44Ac 8:12 But when Philip proclaimed the good news about the kingdom of God and about the name of Jesus the Messiah, men and women believed and were baptized.
44Ac 8:13 Even Simon believed, and after he was baptized he became devoted to Philip. He was amazed to see the signs and great miracles that were happening.
44Ac 8:14 Now when the apostles in Jerusalem heard that Samaritans had accepted the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them.
44Ac 8:15 They went down and prayed for them to receive the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 8:16 Before this he had not come on any of them. They had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 8:17 Then Peter and John laid their hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. 
44Ac 8:18 Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money
44Ac 8:19 and said, "Give me this power too, so that when I lay my hands on someone, he will receive the Holy Spirit."
44Ac 8:20 But Peter said to him, "May your money perish with you because you thought you could obtain God's free gift with money!
44Ac 8:21 You have no part or share in what we're saying, because your heart isn't right with God.
44Ac 8:22 So repent of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, your heart's intent may be forgiven you.
44Ac 8:23 For I see that you're being poisoned by bitterness and you're a prisoner of wickedness!"
44Ac 8:24 Simon answered, "Both of you pray to the Lord for me that none of the things you have said will happen to me." 
44Ac 8:25 After they had given their testimony and spoken the word of the Lord, they started back to Jerusalem, continuing to proclaim the good news in many Samaritan villages.
44Ac 8:26 Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Get up and go south on the road that leads from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a deserted road."
44Ac 8:27 So he got up and went. Now there was an Ethiopian eunuch, who was a member of the court of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians. He was in charge of all her treasures and had come up to Jerusalem to worship.
44Ac 8:28 Now he was returning home, seated in his chariot, and reading from the prophet Isaiah.
44Ac 8:29 The Spirit said to Philip, "Approach that chariot and stay near it."
44Ac 8:30 So Philip ran up to it and heard him reading the prophet Isaiah out loud. Philip asked, "Do you understand what you're reading?"
44Ac 8:31 The man replied, "How can I unless someone guides me?" So he invited Philip to get in and sit with him.
44Ac 8:32 This was the passage of Scripture he was reading£º "Like a sheep he was led away to be slaughtered, and like a lamb is silent before its shearer, so he does not open his mouth.
44Ac 8:33 In his humiliation, justice was denied him. Who can describe his descendants? For his life is taken away from the earth."
44Ac 8:34 The eunuch asked Philip, "I ask you, who is the prophet talking about? Himself? Or someone else?"
44Ac 8:35 Then Philip began to speak, and, starting from this Scripture, he told him the good news about Jesus.
44Ac 8:36 As they were going along the road, they came to some water. The eunuch said, "Look, there's some water. What keeps me from being baptized?"
44Ac 8:37 ...
44Ac 8:38 So he ordered the chariot to stop, and Philip and the eunuch both went down into the water, and Philip baptized him.
44Ac 8:39 When they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord snatched Philip away. The eunuch went on his way rejoicing and did not see Philip again.
44Ac 8:40 But Philip found himself at Azotus. As he was passing through that region, he kept proclaiming the good news in all the towns until he came to Caesarea.
44Ac 9:1 Meanwhile, still spewing death threats against the Lord's disciples, Saul went to the high priest.
44Ac 9:2 He asked him for letters to take with him to the synagogues in Damascus, so that if he found any men or women belonging to the Way, he might bring them in chains to Jerusalem.
44Ac 9:3 As Saul traveled along and was approaching Damascus, a light from heaven suddenly flashed around him.
44Ac 9:4 He dropped to the ground and heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?" 
44Ac 9:5 He asked, "Who are you, Lord?"The voice said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
44Ac 9:6 Now get up, go into the city, and you will be told what you are to do."
44Ac 9:7 Meanwhile, the men who were traveling with Saul were standing speechless, for they heard the voice but didn't see anyone.
44Ac 9:8 When Saul got up off the ground, he couldn't see anything, even though his eyes were open. So his companions took him by the hand and led him into Damascus.
44Ac 9:9 For three days he couldn't see, and he didn't eat or drink anything.8
44Ac 9:10 Now in Damascus there was a disciple named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias!" He answered, "Here I am, Lord." 
44Ac 9:11 The Lord said to him, "Get up, go to the street called Straight, and in the home of Judas look for a man from Tarsus named Saul. At this very moment he is praying.
44Ac 9:12 He has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so he would see again."
44Ac 9:13 But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard many people tell how much evil this man has done to your saints in Jerusalem.
44Ac 9:14 He is here with authority from the high priests to put in chains all who call on your name." 
44Ac 9:15 But the Lord said to him, "Go, since he is my chosen instrument to carry my name to the gentiles, to their kings, and to the descendants of Israel.
44Ac 9:16 For I am going to show him how much he must suffer for my name's sake." 
44Ac 9:17 So Ananias left and went to that house. He laid his hands on Saul and said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus, who appeared to you on the road as you were traveling, has sent me so that you may see again and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
44Ac 9:18 All at once something like scales fell from Saul's eyes, and he could see again. He got up and was baptized,
44Ac 9:19 and after eating some food, he felt strong again. For several days he stayed with the disciples in Damascus. 
44Ac 9:20 He immediately started to preach about Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "This is the Son of God." 
44Ac 9:21 Everyone who heard him was astonished and said, "This is the man who harassed those who were calling on Jesus' name in Jerusalem, isn't it? Didn't he come here to bring them in chains to the high priests?"
44Ac 9:22 But Saul grew more and more persuasive, and continued to confound the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that this man was the Messiah.
44Ac 9:23 After several days had gone by, the Jews plotted to murder Saul,
44Ac 9:24 but their plot became known to him. They were even watching the gates day and night to murder him,
44Ac 9:25 but his disciples took him one night and let him down through the city wall by lowering him in a basket. 
44Ac 9:26 When Saul arrived in Jerusalem, he tried to join the disciples, but they all were afraid of him because they wouldn't believe he was a disciple.
44Ac 9:27 Barnabas, however, introduced Saul to the apostles, telling them how on the road Saul had seen the Lord, who had spoken to him, and how courageously he had spoken in the name of Jesus in Damascus.
44Ac 9:28 So he freely circulated among them in Jerusalem, speaking courageously in the name of the Lord.
44Ac 9:29 He kept talking and arguing with the Hellenistic Jews, but they were bent on murdering him.
44Ac 9:30 When the brothers found out about the plot, they took him down to Caesarea and sent him away to Tarsus.
44Ac 9:31 So the church throughout Judea, Galilee, and Samaria enjoyed peace. As it continued to be built up and to live in the fear of the Lord, it kept increasing in numbers through the encouragement of the Holy Spirit. 
44Ac 9:32 Now when Peter was going around among all of the disciples, he also visited the saints living in Lydda.
44Ac 9:33 There he found a man named Aeneas who was paralyzed and had been bedridden for eight years.
44Ac 9:34 Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus the Messiah is healing you. Get up and put away your mat!" At once he got up,
44Ac 9:35 and all the people who lived in Lydda and Sharon saw him and turned to the Lord. 
44Ac 9:36 In Joppa there was a disciple named Tabitha, which in Greek is Dorcas. She was known for her good actions and acts of charity that she was always doing.
44Ac 9:37 At that time she got sick and died. After they had washed her, they laid her in an upstairs room.
44Ac 9:38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples heard that Peter was there and sent two men to him and begged him, "Come here quickly!"
44Ac 9:39 So Peter got up and went with them. When he arrived, they took him upstairs. All the widows gathered around Peter, crying and showing him all the shirts and coats Dorcas had made while she was still with them.9
44Ac 9:40 Peter made them all go outside. After kneeling down, he prayed, turned to the body, and said, "Tabitha, get up!" She opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
44Ac 9:41 He extended his hand and helped her get up. Then he called the saints, including the widows, and gave her back to them alive.
44Ac 9:42 What happened became known throughout Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
44Ac 9:43 Meanwhile, Peter stayed in Joppa for several days with Simon, a leatherworker.
44Ac 10:1 Now in Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion in what was known as the Italian Regiment.
44Ac 10:2 He was a devout man who feared God, as did everyone in his home. He gave many gifts to the poor among the people and always prayed to God.
44Ac 10:3 One day about three in the afternoon he had a vision and clearly saw an angel of God coming to him and saying to him, "Cornelius!" 
44Ac 10:4 He stared at the angel in terror and asked, "What is it, Lord?" The angel answered him, "Your prayers and your gifts to the poor have arisen as a reminder to God.
44Ac 10:5 Send men now to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter.
44Ac 10:6 He is a guest of Simon, a leatherworker, whose house is by the sea." 
44Ac 10:7 When the angel who had spoken to him had gone, Cornelius summoned two of his household servants and a devout soldier, one of those who served him regularly.
44Ac 10:8 He explained everything to them and sent them to Joppa.7
44Ac 10:9 Around noon the next day, while they were on their way and coming close to the town, Peter went up on the roof to pray.
44Ac 10:10 He became very hungry and wanted to eat, and while the food was being prepared, he fell into a trance
44Ac 10:11 and saw heaven open and something like a large linen sheet coming down, being lowered by its four corners to the ground.
44Ac 10:12 In it were all kinds of four-footed animals, reptiles, and birds of the air.
44Ac 10:13 Then a voice told him, "Get up, Peter! Kill something and eat it."
44Ac 10:14 But Peter said, "Absolutely not, Lord, for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean!" 
44Ac 10:15 Again the voice came to him a second time, "You must stop calling unclean what God has made clean."
44Ac 10:16 This happened three times. Then the sheet was quickly taken back into heaven.
44Ac 10:17 While Peter was still at a loss to know what the vision he had seen could mean, the men sent by Cornelius asked for Simon's house and went to the gate.
44Ac 10:18 They called out and asked if Simon who was called Peter was staying there.
44Ac 10:19 Peter was still thinking about the vision when the Spirit said to him, "Look! Three men are looking for you.
44Ac 10:20 Get up, go downstairs, and don't hesitate to go with them, for I have sent them." 
44Ac 10:21 So Peter went to the men and said, "I'm the man you're looking for. Why are you here?"
44Ac 10:22 The men replied, "Cornelius, a centurion and an upright and God-fearing man who is respected by the whole Jewish nation, was instructed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his home to hear what you have to say." 
44Ac 10:23 So Peter welcomed them as his guests. The next day he got up and went with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa went along with him. 
44Ac 10:24 The next day they arrived in Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called his relatives and close friends together.
44Ac 10:25 When Peter was about to enter, Cornelius met him, bowed down at his feet, and began to worship him.
44Ac 10:26 But Peter made him get up, saying, "Stand up! I, too, am only a man." 
44Ac 10:27 As Peter talked with him, he went in and found that many people had gathered.
44Ac 10:28 He said to them, "You understand how wrong it is for a Jew to associate or visit with a gentile. But God has shown me that I should stop calling anyone common or unclean,
44Ac 10:29 and that is why I didn't hesitate when I was sent for. Now may I ask why you sent for me?"28
44Ac 10:30 Cornelius replied, "Four days ago at this very hour, three o'clock in the afternoon, I was praying in my home. All at once a man in radiant clothes stood in front of me
44Ac 10:31 and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard. God has remembered your gifts to the poor
44Ac 10:32 so send messengers to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter, to come to you. He is a guest in the home of Simon, a leatherworker, by the sea.'
44Ac 10:33 So I sent for you immediately, and it was good of you to come. All of us are here now in the presence of God to listen to everything the Lord has ordered you to say."
44Ac 10:34 Then Peter began to speak£º "Now I understand that God shows no partiality.
44Ac 10:35 Indeed, whoever fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him in any nation.
44Ac 10:36 He has sent his word to the descendants of Israel and brought them the good news of peace through Jesus the Messiah. This man is the Lord of everyone.
44Ac 10:37 You know what happened throughout Judea, beginning in Galilee after the baptism that John preached.
44Ac 10:38 God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power, and because God was with him, he went around doing good and healing everyone who was oppressed by the devil.
44Ac 10:39 We are witnesses of everything Jesus did in the land of the Jews, including Jerusalem. "They hung him on a tree and killed him,
44Ac 10:40 but God raised him on the third day and allowed him to appear - 
44Ac 10:41 not to all the people, but to us who were chosen by God to be witnesses and who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
44Ac 10:42 He also ordered us to preach to the people and to testify solemnly that this is the one appointed by God to be the judge of the living and the dead.
44Ac 10:43 All the prophets testify to this£º everyone who believes in Jesus receives forgiveness of sins through his name."10
44Ac 10:44 While Peter was still making this statement, the Holy Spirit fell on all the people who were listening to his message.
44Ac 10:45 Then the circumcised believers who had come with Peter were amazed that the gift of the Holy Spirit had been poured out on the gentiles, too.
44Ac 10:46 For they heard them speaking in tongues and praising God. Then Peter said,
44Ac 10:47 "No one can stop us from using water to baptize these people who have received the Holy Spirit in the same way that we did, can they?"
44Ac 10:48 So Peter ordered them to be baptized in the name of Jesus the Messiah. Then they asked him to stay there for several days.10
44Ac 11:1 Now the apostles and the brothers who were in Judea heard that the gentiles had also accepted the word of God.
44Ac 11:2 But when Peter went up to Jerusalem, those who emphasized circumcision disagreed with him.
44Ac 11:3 They said, "You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them!" 
44Ac 11:4 Then Peter began to explain to them point by point what had happened. He said,
44Ac 11:5 "I was in the town of Joppa praying when in a trance I saw a vision£º Something like a large linen sheet descended down from heaven, lowered by its four corners, and it came right down to me.
44Ac 11:6 When I examined it closely, I saw four-footed animals of the earth, wild animals, reptiles, and birds of the air.
44Ac 11:7 I also heard a voice telling me, 'Get up, Peter! Kill something and eat it.'
44Ac 11:8 But I replied, 'Absolutely not, Lord, for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth!'
44Ac 11:9 Then the voice from heaven answered a second time, 'You must stop calling common what God has made clean!'
44Ac 11:10 This happened three times. Then everything was pulled back up to heaven.
44Ac 11:11 "At that very moment three men arrived at the house where we were staying. They had been sent to me from Caesarea.
44Ac 11:12 The Spirit told me to go with them without hesitating. These six brothers went with me, too, and we entered the house of the man from Caesarea.
44Ac 11:13 Then he told us how he had seen an angel standing in his home and saying, 'Send messengers to Joppa and summon Simon, who is called Peter.
44Ac 11:14 He will discuss with you how you and your entire household will be saved.'
44Ac 11:15 "When I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as he was first given to us.
44Ac 11:16 Then I remembered what the Lord had said£º 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
44Ac 11:17 Now if God gave them the same gift that he gave us when we believed in the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, who was I to try to stop God?"1611
44Ac 11:18 When they heard this, they calmed down, and praised God, saying, "So God has given repentance that leads to life even to gentiles." 
44Ac 11:19 Now the people who were scattered by the persecution that started because of Stephen went as far as Phoenicia, Cyprus, and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.
44Ac 11:20 But among them were some men from Cyprus and Cyrene, who came to Antioch and began proclaiming the Lord Jesus even to the Hellenistic Jews.
44Ac 11:21 The hand of the Lord was with them, and a large number of people believed and turned to the Lord. 
44Ac 11:22 When the church in Jerusalem heard this news, they sent Barnabas all the way to Antioch.
44Ac 11:23 When he arrived, he rejoiced to see what the grace of God had done, and with hearty determination he kept encouraging all of them to remain faithful to the Lord.
44Ac 11:24 For he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and faith. And so a large number of people was brought to the Lord. 
44Ac 11:25 Then Barnabas left for Tarsus to look for Saul.
44Ac 11:26 When he found him, he brought him to Antioch, and for a whole year they were guests of the church and taught many people. It was in Antioch that the disciples were first called Christians.
44Ac 11:27 At that time some prophets from Jerusalem came down to Antioch.
44Ac 11:28 One of them named Agabus got up and predicted by the Spirit that there would be a severe famine all over the world. This happened during the reign of Claudius.
44Ac 11:29 So all of the disciples decided they would send a contribution to the brothers living in Judea, as they were able,
44Ac 11:30 by sending it through Barnabas and Saul to the elders.
44Ac 12:1 About that time, Herod arrested some people who belonged to the church and mistreated them.
44Ac 12:2 He even had James the brother of John killed with a sword.
44Ac 12:3 When he saw how this was agreeable to the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter, too. This happened during the Festival of Unleavened Bread.
44Ac 12:4 When he arrested Peter, Herod put him in prison and turned him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, planning to bring him out to the people after Passover season.
44Ac 12:5 So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer to God for him was being offered by the assembly.2
44Ac 12:6 That very night, before Herod was going to bring him out, Peter, bound with two chains, was sleeping between two soldiers, and guards in front of the door were watching the prisoners.
44Ac 12:7 Suddenly an angel of the Lord appeared and a light shone in the cell. He tapped Peter on his side, woke him up, and said, "Get up quickly!" His chains fell from his wrists.
44Ac 12:8 Then the angel said to him, "Tuck in your shirt and put on your sandals!" He did this. Then the angel told him, "Put on your coat and follow me!"
44Ac 12:9 So Peter went out and began to follow him, not realizing that what was being done by the angel was real; he thought he was seeing a vision.
44Ac 12:10 They passed the first guard, then the second, and came to the iron gate that led into the city. It opened by itself for them, and they went outside and proceeded one block when the angel suddenly left him.6
44Ac 12:11 Then Peter came to himself and said, "Now I'm sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from Herod and from everything the Jewish people were expecting!"
44Ac 12:12 When Peter realized what had happened, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John who was also called Mark, where a large number of people had gathered and were praying.
44Ac 12:13 When he knocked at the outer gate, a servant-girl named Rhoda came to answer it.
44Ac 12:14 On recognizing Peter's voice, she was so overjoyed that she didn't open the gate but ran back inside and announced that Peter was standing at the gate.
44Ac 12:15 The other people said to her, "You're out of your mind!" But she kept insisting that it was so. Then they said, "It's his angel." 
44Ac 12:16 Meanwhile, Peter kept on knocking and knocking. When they opened the gate, they saw him and were amazed.
44Ac 12:17 He motioned to them with his hand to be quiet, and then he told them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. He added, "Tell this to James and the brothers." Then he left and went somewhere else.12
44Ac 12:18 When morning came, there was a great commotion among the soldiers as to what had become of Peter.
44Ac 12:19 Herod searched for him but didn't find him, so he questioned the guards and ordered them to be executed. Then he left Judea, went down to Caesarea, and stayed there for a while.
44Ac 12:20 Now Herod had been in a violent quarrel with the people of Tyre and Sidon. So they came to him as a group. After they had won over Blastus, who oversaw security for the king's sleeping quarters, they asked for a peace agreement because their country depended on the king's country for food.
44Ac 12:21 Therefore, at a set time Herod put on his royal robes, sat down on the royal seat, and made a speech to them.
44Ac 12:22 The people kept shouting, "This is the voice of a god, not of a man!"
44Ac 12:23 Immediately the angel of the Lord struck him down because he did not give glory to God, and he was eaten by worms and died.
44Ac 12:24 But the word of God continued to grow and spread. 
44Ac 12:25 When Barnabas and Saul had fulfilled their mission, they returned to Jerusalem, bringing with them John who was also called Mark. 
44Ac 13:1 Now Barnabas, Simeon called Niger, Lucius from Cyrene, Manaen, who grew up with Herod the tetrarch, and Saul were prophets and teachers in the church at Antioch.
44Ac 13:2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set Barnabas and Saul apart for me to do the work for which I called them."
44Ac 13:3 Then they fasted and prayed, laid their hands on them, and let them go.
44Ac 13:4 After they had been sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went to Seleucia and from there sailed to Cyprus.
44Ac 13:5 Arriving in Salamis, they began to preach God's word in the Jewish synagogues. They also had John to help them. 
44Ac 13:6 They went through the whole island as far as Paphos, where they found a Jewish occult practitioner and false prophet named Bar-Jesus.
44Ac 13:7 He was associated with the proconsul Sergius Paulus, who was an intelligent man. He sent for Barnabas and Saul because he wanted to hear the word of God.
44Ac 13:8 But Elymas the occult practitioner (that is the meaning of his name) continued to oppose them and tried to turn the proconsul away from the faith.6
44Ac 13:9 But Saul, also known as Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked him straight in the eye
44Ac 13:10 and said, "You are full of every form of deception and trickery, you son of the devil, you enemy of all that is right! You will never stop perverting the straight ways of the Lord, will you - 
44Ac 13:11 The Lord is against you now, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a while!" At that moment a dark mist came over him, and he went around looking for someone to lead him by the hand.
44Ac 13:12 When the proconsul saw what had happened, he believed, for he was astonished at the Lord's teaching.
44Ac 13:13 Then Paul and his men set sail from Paphos and arrived in Perga in Pamphylia. But John left them and went back to Jerusalem.
44Ac 13:14 They left Perga and arrived in Antioch in Pisidia. On the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
44Ac 13:15 After the reading of the Law and the Prophets, the synagogue leaders asked them, "Brothers, if you have any message of encouragement for the people, you may speak." 
44Ac 13:16 Then Paul stood up, motioned with his hand, and said£º "Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen!
44Ac 13:17 The God of this people Israel chose our ancestors and made them a great people during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with a public display of power he led them out of there.
44Ac 13:18 After he had put up with them for40 years in the wilderness,
44Ac 13:19 he destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan. Then God gave their land to the Israelites as an inheritance
44Ac 13:20 for about45 0 years. "After that, he gave them judges until the time of the prophet Samuel.
44Ac 13:21 When they demanded a king, God gave them Kish's son Saul, from the tribe of Benjamin, for40 years.
44Ac 13:22 Then God removed Saul and made David their king, about whom he testified, 'I have found that David, the son of Jesse, is a man after my own heart, who will carry out all my wishes.'
44Ac 13:23 It was from this man's descendants that God, as he promised, brought to Israel a Savior, who is Jesus.
44Ac 13:24 Before Jesus' appearance, John had already preached a baptism of repentance to all the people in Israel.
44Ac 13:25 When John was finishing his work, he said, 'Who do you think I am? I am not the Messiah. No, but he is coming after me, and I am not worthy to untie the sandals on his feet.' 
44Ac 13:26 "My brothers, descendants of Abraham's family, and those among you who fear God, it is to us that the message of this salvation has been sent.
44Ac 13:27 For the people who live in Jerusalem and their leaders, not knowing who Jesus was, condemned him and so fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath.
44Ac 13:28 Although they found no reason to sentence him to death, they asked Pilate to have him executed.
44Ac 13:29 When they had finished doing everything that was written about him, they took him down from the tree and placed him in a tomb.
44Ac 13:30 But God raised him from the dead,
44Ac 13:31 and for many days he appeared to those who had come with him to Jerusalem from Galilee. These are now his witnesses to the people.
44Ac 13:32 We are telling you the good news£º What God promised our ancestors
44Ac 13:33 he has fulfilled for us, their descendants, by raising Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm, 'You are my Son. Today I have become your Father.'
44Ac 13:34 God raised him from the dead, never to experience decay, as he said, 'I will give you the holy promises made to David.'
44Ac 13:35 In another Psalm he says, 'You will not let your Holy One experience decay.'
44Ac 13:36 For David, after he had served God's purpose in his own generation, died and was buried with his ancestors, and so he experienced decay.
44Ac 13:37 However, the man whom God raised did not experience decay.
44Ac 13:38 "Therefore, brothers, you must understand that through him the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,
44Ac 13:39 and that everyone who believes in him is justified and freed from everything that kept you from being justified by the law of Moses.
44Ac 13:40 So be careful that what the prophets said does not happen to you£º 
44Ac 13:41 'Look, you mockers! Be amazed and die! For I am performing an action in your days, one that you would not believe even if someone told you!'"
44Ac 13:42 As Paul and Barnabas were leaving, the people kept urging them to tell them the same things the next Sabbath.
44Ac 13:43 When the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who kept talking to them and urging them to continue in the grace of God. 
44Ac 13:44 The next Sabbath almost the whole town gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
44Ac 13:45 But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to object to the statements made by Paul and even to abuse him. 
44Ac 13:46 Then Paul and Barnabas boldly declared, "We had to speak God's word to you first, but since you reject it and consider yourselves unworthy of eternal life, we are now going to turn to the gentiles.
44Ac 13:47 For that is what the Lord ordered us to do£º 'I have made you a light to the gentiles to be the means of salvation to the very ends of the earth.'"13
44Ac 13:48 When the gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord. Meanwhile, all who had been destined to eternal life believed,
44Ac 13:49 and the word of the Lord began to spread throughout the whole region.
44Ac 13:50 But the Jews stirred up devout women of high social standing and the officials in the city, started a persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their territory.
44Ac 13:51 So Paul and Barnabas shook the dust off their feet in protest against them and went to Iconium.
44Ac 13:52 Meanwhile, the disciples continued to be full of joy and the Holy Spirit. 
44Ac 14:1 In Iconium Paul and Barnabus went into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.
44Ac 14:2 But the Jews who refused to believe stirred up the gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.
44Ac 14:3 They stayed there a considerable time and continued to speak boldly for the Lord, who kept affirming his word of grace and granting signs and wonders to be done by them.
44Ac 14:4 But the people of the city were divided. Some were with the Jews, while others were with the apostles.2
44Ac 14:5 Now when an attempt was made by both gentiles and Jews, along with their authorities, to mistreat and stone them,
44Ac 14:6 Paul and Barnabus found out about it and fled to the Lycaonian towns of Lystra and Derbe and to the surrounding territory.
44Ac 14:7 There they kept telling the good news.
44Ac 14:8 Now in Lystra there was a man sitting down who couldn't use his feet. He had been crippled from birth and had never walked.
44Ac 14:9 He was listening to Paul as he spoke. Paul watched him closely, and when he saw that he had faith to be healed,
44Ac 14:10 he said in a loud voice, "Stand up straight on your feet!" Then the man jumped up and began to walk. 
44Ac 14:11 When the crowds saw what Paul had done, they shouted in the Lycaonian language, "The gods have become like men and have come down to us!"
44Ac 14:12 They began to call Barnabas Zeus, and Paul Hermes, because he was the main speaker.
44Ac 14:13 The priest of the temple of Zeus, which was just outside the city, brought bulls and garlands to the gates. He and the crowds wanted to offer sacrifices.
44Ac 14:14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their clothes and rushed out into the crowd, shouting,
44Ac 14:15 "Men, why are you doing this? We are merely human beings with natures like yours. We are telling you the good news so you'll turn from these worthless things to the living God, who made heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them.
44Ac 14:16 In past generations he allowed all the nations to go their own ways,
44Ac 14:17 yet he has not abandoned his witness£º he continues to do good, to give you rain from heaven, to give you fruitful seasons, to fill you with food and your hearts with joy."
44Ac 14:18 Even by saying this, it was all Paul and Barnabus could do to keep the crowds from offering sacrifices to them.
44Ac 14:19 But some Jews came from Antioch and Iconium and won over the crowds by persuasion. They stoned Paul and dragged him out of the town, thinking he was dead.
44Ac 14:20 But the disciples formed a circle around him, and he got up and went back to town. The next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.
44Ac 14:21 As they were proclaiming the good news in that city, they discipled a large number of people. Then they went back to Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch,
44Ac 14:22 strengthening the disciples and encouraging them to continue in the faith, saying, "We must endure many hardships to get into the kingdom of God."
44Ac 14:23 Paul and Barnabus appointed elders for them in each church, and with prayer and fasting they entrusted them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
44Ac 14:24 Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.
44Ac 14:25 They spoke the word in Perga and went down to Attalia.
44Ac 14:26 From there they sailed back to Antioch, where they had been entrusted to the grace of God for the work they had completed.
44Ac 14:27 When they arrived, they called the church together and told them everything that God had done with them and how he had opened a door so that gentiles would believe.
44Ac 14:28 Then they spent a long time with the disciples.
44Ac 15:1 Then some men came down from Judea and started to teach the brothers, "Unless you are circumcised according to the law of Moses, you can't be saved."
44Ac 15:2 Paul and Barnabas had quite a dispute and argument with them. So Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to confer with the apostles and elders about this question.
44Ac 15:3 They were sent on their way by the church, and as they were going through Phoenecia and Samaria they told of the conversion of the gentiles and brought great joy to all the brothers. 
44Ac 15:4 When they arrived in Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church, the apostles, and the elders, and they reported everything that God had done through them.
44Ac 15:5 But some believers from the party of the Pharisees stood up and said, "The gentiles must be circumcised and ordered to keep the law of Moses." 
44Ac 15:6 So the apostles and the elders met to look into this claim.
44Ac 15:7 After a lengthy debate, Peter stood up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that in the early days God chose me to be the one among you through whom the gentiles would hear the message of the gospel and believe.
44Ac 15:8 God, who knows everyone's heart, showed them he approved by giving them the Holy Spirit, just as he did to us.
44Ac 15:9 He made no distinction between them and us, because of their faith-cleansed hearts.
44Ac 15:10 So why do you test God by putting on the disciples' neck a yoke that neither our ancestors nor we could carry - 
44Ac 15:11 We certainly believe that it is through the grace of the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, that we are saved, just as they are."
44Ac 15:12 The whole crowd was silent as they listened to Barnabas and Paul tell about all the signs and wonders that God had done through them among the gentiles.
44Ac 15:13 After Paul and Barnabus had finished speaking, James responded, "Brothers, listen to me£º
44Ac 15:14 Simeon has explained how God first showed his concern for the gentiles by taking from among them a people for his name.
44Ac 15:15 This agrees with the words of the prophets. As it is written,14
44Ac 15:16 '"After this, I will come back and set up David's fallen tent again. I will restore its ruined places and set it up again
44Ac 15:17 so that the rest of the people may search for the Lord, including all the gentiles who are called by my name," declares the Lord. 'He is the one who has been doing these things
44Ac 15:18 that have been known from long ago.'
44Ac 15:19 Therefore, I have decided that we should not trouble these gentiles who are turning to God.
44Ac 15:20 Instead, we should write to them to keep away from things polluted by idols, from sexual immorality, from anything strangled, and from blood.
44Ac 15:21 After all, Moses has had people to proclaim him in every city for generations, and on every Sabbath his books are read aloud in the synagogues."
44Ac 15:22 Then the apostles, the elders, and the whole church decided to choose some of their men to send with Paul and Barnabas to Antioch. These were Judas, who was called Barsabbas, and Silas, who were leaders among the brothers.
44Ac 15:23 They wrote this letter for them to deliver£º "From£º The apostles and the elders, your brothers To£º Their gentile brothers in Antioch, Syria, and Cilicia. Greetings.
44Ac 15:24 We have heard that some men, coming from us without instructions from us, have said things to trouble you and have unsettled you.
44Ac 15:25 So we have unanimously decided to choose men and send them to you with our dear Barnabas and Paul,
44Ac 15:26 who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah.
44Ac 15:27 We have therefore sent Judas and Silas to tell you the same things by word of mouth.
44Ac 15:28 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to place on you any burden but these essential requirements£º
44Ac 15:29 to keep away from food sacrificed to idols, from blood, from anything strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you avoid these things, you will do well. Goodbye."
44Ac 15:30 So the men were sent on their way and arrived in Antioch. They gathered the congregation together and delivered the letter.
44Ac 15:31 When the people read it, they were pleased with how the letter encouraged them.
44Ac 15:32 Then Judas and Silas, who were also prophets, said a lot to encourage and strengthen the brothers.
44Ac 15:33 After staying there for some time, they were sent back with a greeting from the brothers to those who had sent them.
44Ac 15:34 ...
44Ac 15:35 Both Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch to teach and proclaim the word of the Lord, as did many others.
44Ac 15:36 A few days later, Paul said to Barnabas, "Let's go back and visit the brothers in every town where we proclaimed the word of the Lord and see how they're doing."
44Ac 15:37 Barnabas wanted to take along John, who was called Mark,
44Ac 15:38 but Paul did not think it was right to take along the man who had deserted them in Pamphylia and who had not gone with them into the work.
44Ac 15:39 The disagreement was so sharp that they parted ways. Barnabas took Mark and sailed to Cyprus,
44Ac 15:40 while Paul chose Silas and left after the brothers had entrusted him to the grace of the Lord.
44Ac 15:41 He went through Syria and Cilicia and strengthened the churches. 
44Ac 16:1 Paul also went to Derbe and Lystra, where there was a disciple named Timothy, the son of a believing Jewish wife whose husband was a Greek.
44Ac 16:2 Timothy was highly regarded by the brothers in Lystra and Iconium.
44Ac 16:3 Paul wanted this man to go with him, so he took him and had him circumcised because of the Jews who lived in that region, because everyone knew that Timothy's father was a Greek.
44Ac 16:4 As they went from town to town, they delivered the decisions reached by the apostles and elders in Jerusalem for them to obey.
44Ac 16:5 So the churches continued to be strengthened in the faith and to increase in numbers every day.4
44Ac 16:6 Because they had been prevented by the Holy Spirit from speaking the word in Asia, Paul and Timothy went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia.
44Ac 16:7 They went as far as Mysia and tried to enter Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them,
44Ac 16:8 so they bypassed Mysia and went down to Troas.
44Ac 16:9 During the night Paul had a vision. A man from Macedonia was standing there and pleading with him, "Come over to Macedonia and help us!"
44Ac 16:10 As soon as he had seen the vision, we immediately looked for a way to go to Macedonia, because we were convinced that God had called us to tell the people there the good news.9
44Ac 16:11 Sailing from Troas, we went straight to Samothrace, the next day to Neapolis,
44Ac 16:12 and from there to Philippi, an important city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We were in this city for several days. 
44Ac 16:13 On the Sabbath day we went out the city gate and walked along the river, where we thought there was a place of prayer. We sat down and began talking to the women who had gathered there.
44Ac 16:14 A woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a dealer in purple goods, was listening to us. She was a worshiper of God, and the Lord opened her heart to listen carefully to what was being said by Paul.
44Ac 16:15 When she and her family were baptized, she urged us, "If you are convinced that I am a believer in the Lord, come and stay at my home." And she continued to insist that we do so. 
44Ac 16:16 Once, as we were going to the place of prayer, we met a slave girl who had a spirit of fortune-telling and who had brought her owners a great deal of money by predicting the future.
44Ac 16:17 She would follow Paul and us and shout, "These men are servants of the Most High God and are proclaiming to you a way of salvation!"
44Ac 16:18 She kept doing this for many days until Paul became annoyed, turned to her and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus the Messiah to come out of her!" And it came out that very moment.
44Ac 16:19 When her owners realized that their hope of making money was gone, they grabbed Paul and Silas and dragged them before the authorities in the public square.
44Ac 16:20 They brought them before the magistrates and said, "These men are stirring up a lot of trouble in our city. They are Jews
44Ac 16:21 and are advocating customs that we are not allowed to accept or practice as Romans."
44Ac 16:22 The crowd joined in the attack against them. Then the magistrates had Paul and Silas stripped of their clothes and ordered them beaten with rods.
44Ac 16:23 After giving them a severe beating, they threw them in jail and ordered the jailer to keep them under tight security.
44Ac 16:24 Having received these orders, he put them into the inner cell and fastened their feet in leg irons.
44Ac 16:25 Around midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them.
44Ac 16:26 Suddenly, there was an earthquake so violent that the foundations of the prison were shaken. All the doors immediately flew open, and everyone's chains were unfastened. 
44Ac 16:27 When the jailer woke up and saw the prison doors wide open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, since he thought the prisoners had escaped.
44Ac 16:28 But Paul shouted in a loud voice, "Don't hurt yourself, because we are all here!"
44Ac 16:29 The jailer asked for torches and rushed inside. Trembling as he knelt in front of Paul and Silas,
44Ac 16:30 he took them outside and asked, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44Ac 16:31 They answered, "Believe on the Lord Jesus, and you and your family will be saved."
44Ac 16:32 Then they spoke the word of the Lord to him and everyone in his home.
44Ac 16:33 At that hour of the night he took them and washed their wounds. Then he and his entire family were baptized immediately.
44Ac 16:34 He brought Paul and Silas upstairs into his house and set food before them. He was thrilled, as was his household, to believe in God.
44Ac 16:35 When day came, the magistrates sent guards, who commanded, "Release those men."
44Ac 16:36 The jailer reported these words to Paul, and added, "The magistrates have sent word to release you. So come out now and go in peace."
44Ac 16:37 But Paul told the guards, "The magistrates have had us beaten publicly without a trial and have thrown us into jail, even though we are Roman citizens. Now are they going to throw us out secretly? Certainly not! Have them come and escort us out." 
44Ac 16:38 The guards reported these words to the magistrates, and they became afraid when they heard that Paul and Silas were Roman citizens.
44Ac 16:39 So the magistrates came, apologized to them, and escorted them out. Then they asked them to leave the city.
44Ac 16:40 Leaving the jail, Paul and Silas went to Lydia's house. They saw the brothers, encouraged them, and then left. 
44Ac 17:1 Paul and Silas traveled through Amphipolis and Apollonia and came to Thessalonica, where there was a Jewish synagogue.
44Ac 17:2 As usual, Paul entered there and on three Sabbaths discussed the Scriptures with them.
44Ac 17:3 He explained and showed them that the Messiah had to suffer and rise from the dead£º "This very Jesus whom I proclaim to you is the Messiah."
44Ac 17:4 Some of them were persuaded and began to be associated with Paul and Silas, especially a large crowd of devout Greeks and the wives of many prominent men.
44Ac 17:5 But the Jews became jealous, and they took some contemptible characters who used to hang out in the public square, formed a mob, and started a riot in the city. They attacked Jason's home and searched it for Paul and Silas in order to bring them out to the people.
44Ac 17:6 When they didn't find them, they dragged Jason and some other brothers before the city officials and shouted, "These fellows who have turned the world upside down have come here, too,
44Ac 17:7 and Jason has welcomed them as his guests. All of them oppose the emperor's decrees by saying that there is another king - Jesus!"4
44Ac 17:8 The crowd and the city officials were upset when they heard this,
44Ac 17:9 but after they had gotten a bond from Jason and the others they let them go.
44Ac 17:10 That night the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away to Berea. When they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue.
44Ac 17:11 These people were more receptive than those in Thessalonica. They were very willing to receive the message, and every day they carefully examined the Scriptures to see if those things were so.
44Ac 17:12 Many of them believed, including a large number of prominent Greek women and men.
44Ac 17:13 But when the Jews in Thessalonica found out that the word of God had been proclaimed by Paul also in Berea, they went there to upset and incite the crowds.
44Ac 17:14 Then the brothers immediately sent Paul away to the coast, but Silas and Timothy stayed there.
44Ac 17:15 The men who escorted Paul took him all the way to Athens and, after receiving instructions to have Silas and Timothy join him as soon as possible, they left.
44Ac 17:16 While Paul was waiting for them in Athens, his spirit was deeply disturbed to see the city full of idols.
44Ac 17:17 So he began holding discussions in the synagogue with the Jews and other worshipers, as well as every day in the public square with anyone who happened to be there.
44Ac 17:18 Some Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also debated with him. Some asked, "What is this blabbermouth trying to say?" while others said, "He seems to be preaching about foreign gods." This was because Paul was telling the good news about Jesus and the resurrection.
44Ac 17:19 Then they took him, brought him before the Areopagus, and asked, "May we know what this new teaching of yours is - 
44Ac 17:20 It sounds rather strange to our ears, and we would like to know what it means."
44Ac 17:21 Now all the Athenians and the foreigners living there used to spend their time doing nothing else other than listening to the latest ideas or repeating them.
44Ac 17:22 So Paul stood up in front of the Areopagus and said, "Men of Athens, I see that you are very religious in every way.
44Ac 17:23 For as I was walking around and looking closely at the objects you worship, I even found an altar with this written on it£º 'To an unknown god.' So I am telling you about the unknown object you worship.
44Ac 17:24 The God who made the world and everything in it is the Lord of heaven and earth. He doesn't live in shrines made by human hands,
44Ac 17:25 and he isn't served by people as if he needed anything. He himself gives everyone life, breath, and everything else.
44Ac 17:26 From one man he made every nation of humanity to live all over the earth, fixing the seasons of the year and the national boundaries within which they live,
44Ac 17:27 so that they might look for God, somehow reach for him, and find him. Of course, he is never far from any one of us.
44Ac 17:28 For we live, move, and exist because of him, as some of your own poets have said£º 'For we are his children, too.'
44Ac 17:29 So if we are God's children, we shouldn't think that the divine being is like gold, silver, or stone, or is an image carved by humans using their own imagination and skill.
44Ac 17:30 Though God has overlooked those times of ignorance, he now commands everyone everywhere to repent,
44Ac 17:31 because he has set a day when he is going to judge the world with justice through a man whom he has appointed. He has given proof of this to everyone by raising him from the dead." 
44Ac 17:32 When they heard about a resurrection of the dead, some began joking about it, while others said, "We will hear you again about this."
44Ac 17:33 And so Paul left the meeting.
44Ac 17:34 Some men joined him and became believers. With them were Dionysius, who was a member of the Areopagus, a woman named Damaris, and some others along with them.17
44Ac 18:1 After this, Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
44Ac 18:2 There he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, who had recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla because Claudius had ordered all the Jews to leave Rome. Paul went to visit them,
44Ac 18:3 and because they had the same trade he stayed with them. They worked together because they were tentmakers by trade.
44Ac 18:4 Every Sabbath he would speak in the synagogue, trying to persuade both Jews and Greeks.
44Ac 18:5 But when Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul devoted himself entirely to the word as he emphatically assured the Jews that Jesus is the Messiah.
44Ac 18:6 But when they began to oppose him and insult him, he shook out his clothes in protest and told them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the gentiles."5 
44Ac 18:7 Then he left that place and went to the home of a man named Titius Justus, who worshiped God and whose house was next door to the synagogue.
44Ac 18:8 Now Crispus, the leader of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, along with his whole family. Many Corinthians who heard Paul also believed and were baptized.7
44Ac 18:9 One night the Lord said to Paul in a vision, "Stop being afraid to speak out! Don't remain silent!
44Ac 18:10 For I am with you, and no one will lay a hand on you or harm you, because I have many people in this city."
44Ac 18:11 So Paul lived there for a year and a half and continued to teach the word of God among the people there.
44Ac 18:12 While Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews gathered together, attacked Paul, and brought him before the judge's seat.
44Ac 18:13 They said, "This man is persuading people to worship God in ways that are contrary to the law."
44Ac 18:14 Paul was about to speak when Gallio admonished the Jews, "If there were some misdemeanor or crime involved, it would be reasonable to put up with you Jews.
44Ac 18:15 But since it is a question about words, names, and your own law, you will have to take care of that yourselves. I refuse to be a judge in these matters."
44Ac 18:16 So he drove them away from the judge's seat.
44Ac 18:17 Then all of them took Sosthenes, the synagogue leader, and began beating him in front of the judge's seat. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this. 
44Ac 18:18 After staying there for quite a while longer, Paul said goodbye to the brothers and sailed for Syria, accompanied by Priscilla and Aquila. In Cenchraea he had his hair cut, since he was under a vow.
44Ac 18:19 When they arrived in Ephesus, he left Priscilla and Aquila there. Then he went into the synagogue and had a discussion with the Jews.
44Ac 18:20 They asked him to stay longer, but he refused.
44Ac 18:21 As he told them goodbye, he said, "I will come back to you again if it is God's will." Then he set sail from Ephesus.
44Ac 18:22 When he arrived in Caesarea, he went up to Jerusalem, greeted the church there, and then returned to Antioch.
44Ac 18:23 After spending some time there, he departed and went from place to place through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples. 
44Ac 18:24 Meanwhile, a Jew named Apollos arrived in Ephesus. He was a native of Alexandria, an eloquent man, and well versed in the Scriptures.
44Ac 18:25 He had been instructed in the Lord's way, and with spiritual fervor he kept speaking and teaching accurately about Jesus, although he knew only about John's baptism.
44Ac 18:26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him home and explained God's way to him more accurately.
44Ac 18:27 When Apollos wanted to cross over to Achaia, the brothers wrote to the disciples there, urging them to welcome him. On his arrival he greatly helped those who, through God's grace, had believed.
44Ac 18:28 He successfully refuted the Jews in public and proved by the Scriptures that Jesus is the Messiah.
44Ac 19:1 It was while Apollos was in Corinth that Paul passed through the inland districts and came to Ephesus. He found a few disciples there
44Ac 19:2 and asked them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" They answered him, "No, we haven't even heard that there is a Holy Spirit." 
44Ac 19:3 He then asked, "Then into what were you baptized?" They answered, "Into John's baptism." 
44Ac 19:4 Then Paul said, "John baptized when they repented, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, in Jesus."
44Ac 19:5 On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 19:6 When Paul laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began to speak in tongues and to prophesy.
44Ac 19:7 There were about twelve men in all.
44Ac 19:8 He went into the synagogue and spoke there boldly for three months, holding discussions and persuading those who heard him about the kingdom of God.
44Ac 19:9 But when some people became stubborn, refused to believe, and slandered the Way in front of the people, Paul left them, taking his disciples away with him, and held daily discussions in the lecture hall of Tyrannus.
44Ac 19:10 This went on for two years, so that all who lived in Asia, Jews and Greeks alike, heard the word of the Lord.
44Ac 19:11 God continued to do extraordinary miracles through Paul.
44Ac 19:12 When handkerchiefs and aprons that had touched his skin were taken to the sick, their diseases left them and evil spirits went out of them.
44Ac 19:13 Then some Jews who went around trying to drive out demons attempted to use the name of the Lord Jesus on those who had evil spirits, saying, "I command you by that Jesus whom Paul preaches!"
44Ac 19:14 Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.13
44Ac 19:15 But the evil spirit said to them, "Jesus I know, and I am getting acquainted with Paul, but who are you?"
44Ac 19:16 Then the man with the evil spirit jumped on them, got the better of them, and so violently overpowered all of them that they fled out of the house naked and bruised.
44Ac 19:17 When this became known to everyone living in Ephesus, Jews and Greeks alike, they all became terrified, and the name of the Lord Jesus began to be held in high honor.
44Ac 19:18 Many who became believers kept coming to confess and talk about what they had been doing.
44Ac 19:19 Moreover, many people who had practiced occult arts gathered their books and burned them in front of everybody. They estimated their value and found them to have been worth 50,000 silver coins.
44Ac 19:20 In that way the word of the Lord kept spreading and triumphing.17
44Ac 19:21 After these things had happened, Paul decided to go through Macedonia and Achaia and then to go on to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have gone there, I must also see Rome."
44Ac 19:22 Then he sent two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, to Macedonia, while he himself stayed in Asia a while longer. 
44Ac 19:23 Now about that time a great commotion broke out concerning the Way.
44Ac 19:24 By making silver shrines of Artemis, a silversmith named Demetrius provided a large income for skilled workers.
44Ac 19:25 He called a meeting of these men and others who were engaged in similar trades and said, "Men, you well know that we get a good income from this business.
44Ac 19:26 You also see and hear that, not only in Ephesus, but almost all over Asia, this man Paul has won over and taken away a large crowd by telling them that gods made by human hands are not gods at all.
44Ac 19:27 There is a danger not only that our business will lose its reputation but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis will be brought into disrepute and that she will be robbed of her majesty that brought all Asia and the world to worship her."
44Ac 19:28 When they heard this, they became furious and began to shout, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44Ac 19:29 The city was filled with confusion, and the people rushed into the theater together, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Paul's fellow travelers from Macedonia.
44Ac 19:30 Paul wanted to go into the crowd, but the disciples wouldn't let him.
44Ac 19:31 Even some officials of the province of Asia who were his friends sent him a message urging him not to risk his life in the theater.
44Ac 19:32 Meanwhile, some were shouting one thing and some another, since the crowd was confused, and most of them didn't know why they were meeting.
44Ac 19:33 Some of the crowd concluded it was because of Alexander, since the Jews had pushed him to the front. So Alexander motioned for silence and tried to make a defense before the people.
44Ac 19:34 But when they found out that he was a Jew, they all started to shout in unison for about two hours, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"1933
44Ac 19:35 When the city recorder had quieted the crowd, he said, "Men of Ephesus, who in the world doesn't know that this city of Ephesus is the keeper of the temple of the great Artemis and of the statue that fell down from heaven - 
44Ac 19:36 Since these things cannot be denied, you must be quiet and not do anything reckless.
44Ac 19:37 For you have brought these men here, although they neither rob temples nor blaspheme our goddess.
44Ac 19:38 So if Demetrius and his workers have a charge against anyone, the courts are open and there are proconsuls. They should accuse one another there.
44Ac 19:39 But if you want anything else, it must be settled in the regular assembly,
44Ac 19:40 because we are in danger of being charged with rioting today, and there is no good reason we can give to justify this commotion."
44Ac 19:41 After saying this, he dismissed the assembly.
44Ac 20:1 When the uproar was over, Paul sent for the disciples and encouraged them. Then he said goodbye to them and left to go to Macedonia.
44Ac 20:2 He went through those regions and encouraged the people with everything he had to say. Then he went to Greece
44Ac 20:3 and stayed there for three months. When he was about to sail for Syria, a plot was initiated against him by the Jews, so he decided to go back through Macedonia.
44Ac 20:4 He was accompanied by Sopater (the son of Pyrrhus) from Berea, Aristarchus and Secundus from Thessalonica, Gaius from Derbe, Timothy, and Tychicus and Trophimus from Asia.
44Ac 20:5 These men went on ahead and were waiting for us in Troas.
44Ac 20:6 After the Feast of Unleavened Bread, we sailed from Philippi, and days later we joined them in Troas and stayed there for seven days. 
44Ac 20:7 On the first day of the week, when we had met to break bread, Paul began to address the people. Since he intended to leave the next day, he went on speaking until midnight.
44Ac 20:8 Now there were many lamps in the upstairs room where we were meeting.
44Ac 20:9 A young man named Eutychus, who was sitting in a window, began to sink off into a deep sleep as Paul kept speaking longer and longer. Overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third floor and was picked up dead.
44Ac 20:10 But Paul went down, bent over him, took him into his arms, and said, "Stop being alarmed, because he's still alive."
44Ac 20:11 Then he went back upstairs, broke bread, and ate. He talked with them for a long time, until dawn, and then left.
44Ac 20:12 They took the young man away alive and were greatly relieved.10
44Ac 20:13 We proceeded to the ship and sailed for Assos, where we intended to pick up Paul. He had arranged it this way, since he had planned to travel there on foot.
44Ac 20:14 When he met us in Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene.
44Ac 20:15 We sailed from there and on the following day arrived off Chios. The next day we crossed over to Samos and stayed at Trogyllium. The day after that we came to Miletus.
44Ac 20:16 Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus to avoid spending time in Asia, as he was in a hurry to get to Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost, if that was possible.14
44Ac 20:17 From Miletus he sent messengers to Ephesus to ask the elders of the church to meet with him.
44Ac 20:18 When they came to him, he said to them, "You know how I lived among you the entire time from the first day I set foot in Asia.
44Ac 20:19 I served the Lord with all humility, with tears, and with trials that came to me through the plots of the Jews.
44Ac 20:20 I never shrank from telling you anything that would help you nor from teaching you publicly and from house to house.
44Ac 20:21 I testified to both Jews and Greeks about repentance to God and faith in our Lord Jesus.
44Ac 20:22 "And now, compelled by the Spirit, I am on my way to Jerusalem, not knowing what will happen to me there,
44Ac 20:23 except that in town after town the Holy Spirit assures me that imprisonment and suffering are waiting for me.
44Ac 20:24 But I don't place any value on my life, if only I can finish my race and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus of testifying to the gospel of God's grace.
44Ac 20:25 "Now I know that none of you among whom I traveled preaching about the kingdom will ever see my face again.
44Ac 20:26 I therefore declare to you today that I am not responsible for the blood of any of you,
44Ac 20:27 for I never shrank from telling you the whole plan of God.
44Ac 20:28 Pay attention to yourselves and to the entire flock over which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to be shepherds of God's church, which he acquired with his own blood.
44Ac 20:29 I know that when I'm gone savage wolves will come among you and not spare the flock.
44Ac 20:30 Indeed, some of your own men will arise and distort the truth in order to lure the disciples into following them.
44Ac 20:31 So be alert! Remember that for three years, night and day, I never stopped tearfully warning each of you.20
44Ac 20:32 "I am now entrusting you to God and to the message of his grace, which is able to build you up and secure for you an inheritance among all who are sanctified.
44Ac 20:33 I never desired anyone's silver, gold, or clothes.
44Ac 20:34 You yourselves know that I worked with my own hands to support myself and those who were with me.
44Ac 20:35 In every way I showed you that by working hard like this we should help the weak and remember the words that the Lord Jesus himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
44Ac 20:36 When Paul had said this, he knelt down and prayed with all of them.
44Ac 20:37 All of them cried and cried as they put their arms around Paul and kissed him affectionately.
44Ac 20:38 They were especially sorrowful because of what he had said - that they would never see his face again. Then they took him to the ship. 
44Ac 21:1 When we had torn ourselves away from those brothers, we sailed straight to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. 
44Ac 21:2 There we found a ship going across to Phoenecia, so we went aboard and sailed on.
44Ac 21:3 We came in sight of Cyprus, and leaving it on our left we sailed on to Syria and landed at Tyre because the ship was to unload its cargo there.
44Ac 21:4 So we located some disciples and stayed there for seven days. Through the Spirit they kept telling Paul not to go to Jerusalem,
44Ac 21:5 but when our time there came to an end, we left and proceeded on our journey. All of them with their wives and children accompanied us out of the city. We knelt on the beach, prayed,
44Ac 21:6 and said goodbye to each other. Then we reboarded the ship, and they went back home. 
44Ac 21:7 When we completed our voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, greeted the brothers there, and stayed with them for one day.
44Ac 21:8 The next day we left and came to Caesarea. We went to the home of Philip the evangelist, one of the Seven, and stayed with him.
44Ac 21:9 He had four unmarried daughters who could prophesy. 
44Ac 21:10 After we had been there for a number of days, a prophet named Agabus arrived from Judea.
44Ac 21:11 He came to us, took Paul's belt, and tied his own feet and hands with it. Then he said, "The Holy Spirit says, 'This is how the Jews in Jerusalem will tie up the man who owns this belt. Then they will hand him over to the gentiles.'"
44Ac 21:12 When we heard this, we and the people who lived there begged Paul not to go up to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:13 At this Paul replied, "What do you mean by crying and breaking my heart? I'm ready not only to be tied up in Jerusalem but even to die for the name of the Lord Jesus!" 
44Ac 21:14 When he could not be persuaded otherwise, we remained silent except to say, "May the Lord's will be done." 
44Ac 21:15 When our time there ended, we got ready to go up to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:16 Some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us. They took us to the home of Mnason to be his guests. He was from Cyprus and had been an early disciple.
44Ac 21:17 When we arrived in Jerusalem, the brothers there welcomed us warmly.
44Ac 21:18 The next day Paul went with us to visit James, and all the elders were present.
44Ac 21:19 After greeting them, Paul related one by one the things that God had done among the gentiles through his ministry.
44Ac 21:20 When they heard about it, they praised God and told him, "You see, brother, how many thousands of believers there are among the Jews, and all of them are zealous for the law.
44Ac 21:21 But they have been told about you - that you teach all the Jews living among the gentiles to forsake the Law of Moses, and that you tell them not to circumcise their children or observe the customs.
44Ac 21:22 What is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.
44Ac 21:23 So do what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow.
44Ac 21:24 Take these men, go through the purification ceremony with them, and pay their expenses to shave their heads. Then everyone will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you are carefully observing and keeping the law.
44Ac 21:25 As for the gentiles who have become believers, we have sent a letter with our decision that they should keep away from food that has been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from anything strangled, and from sexual immorality."20
44Ac 21:26 Then Paul took those men and the next day purified himself with them. Then he went into the temple to announce the time when their days of purification would end and when the sacrifice would be offered for each of them.
44Ac 21:27 When the seven days were almost over, the Jews from Asia, seeing Paul in the temple, stirred up a large crowd. They grabbed Paul,
44Ac 21:28 yelling, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who teaches everyone everywhere to turn against our people, the law, and this place. More than that, he has even brought Greeks into the temple and desecrated this holy place."
44Ac 21:29 For they had earlier seen Trophimus the Ephesian in the city with him and assumed that Paul had taken him into the temple.
44Ac 21:30 The whole city was in chaos. The people rushed together, grabbed Paul, dragged him out of the temple, and at once the doors were sealed shut.
44Ac 21:31 The crowd was trying to kill Paul when a report reached the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in an uproar.
44Ac 21:32 Immediately the tribune took some soldiers and officers and ran down to the crowd. When the people saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
44Ac 21:33 Then the tribune came up, grabbed Paul, and ordered him to be tied up with two chains. He then asked who Paul was and what he had done.
44Ac 21:34 Some of the crowd shouted this and some that. Since the tribune couldn't learn the facts due to the confusion, he ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks.
44Ac 21:35 When Paul got to the steps, he had to be carried by the soldiers because the mob had become so violent.
44Ac 21:36 The crowd of people kept following him and shouting, "Kill him!" 
44Ac 21:37 Just as Paul was about to be taken into the barracks, he asked the tribune, "May I say something to you?" The tribune asked, "Oh, do you speak Greek - 
44Ac 21:38 You're not the Egyptian who started a revolt some time ago and led 4,000 assassins into the desert, are you?" 
44Ac 21:39 Paul replied, "I am a Jew from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no insignificant city. Please let me speak to the people."
44Ac 21:40 The tribune gave him permission, and Paul, standing on the steps, motioned for the people to be silent. When everyone had quieted down, he spoke to them in the Hebrew language£º
44Ac 22:1 "Brothers and fathers, listen to the defense that I am now making before you."
44Ac 22:2 When they heard him speaking to them in Hebrew, they became even more quiet, and he continued£º
44Ac 22:3 "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia but raised in this city and educated at the feet of Gamaliel in the strict ways of our ancestral law. I am as zealous for God as all of you are today.
44Ac 22:4 I persecuted this Way, even executing people, and kept tying up both men and women and putting them in prison,
44Ac 22:5 as the high priest and the whole council of elders can testify about me. From them I also received letters to the brothers in Damascus, and I was going there to tie up those who were there and bring them back to Jerusalem to be punished. 
44Ac 22:6 "But while I was on my way and approaching Damascus about noon, a bright light from heaven suddenly flashed around me.
44Ac 22:7 I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me?'
44Ac 22:8 "I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' "He said to me, 'I am Jesus from Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.'
44Ac 22:9 The men who were with me saw the light but didn't understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me. 
44Ac 22:10 "Then I asked, 'What am I to do, Lord?' "The Lord told me, 'Get up and go into Damascus, and there you will be told everything you are destined to do.'
44Ac 22:11 Since I could not see because of the brightness of the light, the men who were with me took me by the hand and led me into Damascus.
44Ac 22:12 "A certain Ananias, who was a devout man with respect to the law and who was highly regarded by all the Jews living there,
44Ac 22:13 came to me. He stood beside me and said, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight!' At that moment I could see him.
44Ac 22:14 "Then he said, 'The God of our ancestors has chosen you to know his will, to see the Righteous One, and to hear his own voice,
44Ac 22:15 because you will be his witness to all people of what you have seen and heard.
44Ac 22:16 What are you waiting for now? Get up, be baptized, and have your sins washed away as you call on his name.' 
44Ac 22:17 "Then I returned to Jerusalem. While I was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance
44Ac 22:18 and saw the Lord saying to me, 'Hurry up and get out of Jerusalem at once, because the people won't accept your testimony about me.' 
44Ac 22:19 "I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that in every synagogue I kept imprisoning and beating those who believe in you.
44Ac 22:20 Even when the blood of your witness Stephen was being shed, I was standing there approving it and guarding the coats of those who were killing him.' 
44Ac 22:21 "Then he said to me, 'Go, because I will send you far away to the gentiles.'" 
44Ac 22:22 Up to this point they listened to him, but then they began to shout, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! He's not fit to go on living!"
44Ac 22:23 While they were yelling, tossing their coats around, and throwing dirt into the air,
44Ac 22:24 the tribune ordered Paul to be taken into the barracks and told the soldiers to beat and question him in order to find out why the people were yelling at him like this.
44Ac 22:25 But when they had tied him up with the straps, Paul asked the centurion who was standing there, "Is it legal for you to whip a Roman citizen who hasn't been condemned?" 
44Ac 22:26 When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, "What are you doing? This man is a Roman citizen!"
44Ac 22:27 So the tribune went and asked Paul, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" "Yes," he said.
44Ac 22:28 Then the tribune replied, "I paid a lot of money for this citizenship of mine." Paul said, "But I was born a citizen."
44Ac 22:29 Immediately those who were about to examine him stepped back, and the tribune was afraid when he found out that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had tied him up.23
44Ac 22:30 The next day, since the Tribune wanted to find out exactly what Paul was being accused of by the Jews, he released him and ordered the high priests and the entire Council to meet. Then he brought Paul down and had him stand before them.
44Ac 23:1 PaullookedstraightattheCouncil and said, "Brothers, with a clear conscience I have done my duty before God up to this very day."
44Ac 23:2 Then the high priest Ananias ordered the men standing near him to strike him on the mouth.
44Ac 23:3 At this Paul said to him, "God will strike you, you whitewashed wall! How can you sit there and judge me according to the law and yet in violation of the law order me to be struck?" 
44Ac 23:4 The men standing near him asked, "Do you mean to insult God's high priest?"
44Ac 23:5 Paul answered, "I didn't realize, brothers, that he is the high priest. After all, it is written, 'You must not speak evil about a ruler of your people.'"
44Ac 23:6 When Paul saw that some of them were Sadducees and others were Pharisees, he shouted in the Council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee and a descendant of Pharisees. I am on trial concerning the hope that the dead will be resurrected."
44Ac 23:7 After he said that, an angry quarrel broke out between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided,
44Ac 23:8 because the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection and that there is no such thing as an angel or spirit, but the Pharisees believe in all those things. 
44Ac 23:9 There was a great deal of shouting until some of the scribes who belonged to the party of the Pharisees stood up and argued forcefully, "We find nothing wrong with this man. What if a spirit or an angel has spoken to him?" 
44Ac 23:10 The quarrel was becoming violent, and the tribune was afraid that they would tear Paul to pieces. So he ordered the soldiers to go down, take him away from them by force, and bring him into the barracks.
44Ac 23:11 That night the Lord stood near Paul and said, "Have courage! For just as you have testified about me in Jerusalem, you must testify in Rome, too." 
44Ac 23:12 In the morning, the Jews formed a conspiracy and took an oath not to eat or drink anything before they had killed Paul.
44Ac 23:13 More than40 men formed this conspiracy.
44Ac 23:14 They went to the high priests and elders and said, "We have taken a solemn oath not to taste any food before we have killed Paul.
44Ac 23:15 Now then, you and the Council must notify the tribune to bring him down to you on the pretext that you want to look into his case more carefully, but before he arrives we'll be ready to kill him."
44Ac 23:16 But the son of Paul's sister heard about the ambush, so he came and got into the barracks and told Paul.
44Ac 23:17 Then Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the tribune, because he has something to tell him."
44Ac 23:18 So the centurion took him, brought him to the tribune, and said, "The prisoner Paul called me and asked me to bring this young man to you. He has something to tell you."
44Ac 23:19 The tribune took him by the hand, stepped aside to be alone with him, and asked, "What have you got to tell me?"
44Ac 23:20 He answered, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the Council tomorrow as though they were going to examine his case more carefully.
44Ac 23:21 Don't believe them, because more than40 of them are planning to ambush him. They have taken an oath not to eat or drink before they have killed him. They are ready now, just waiting for your consent."
44Ac 23:22 The tribune dismissed the young man and ordered him not to tell anyone that he had notified him.
44Ac 23:23 Then he summoned two centurions and ordered, "Get20 0 soldiers ready to leave for Caesarea at nine o'clock tonight, along with70 mounted soldiers and20 0 soldiers with spears.
44Ac 23:24 Provide a mount for Paul to ride, and take him safely to Governor Felix."
44Ac 23:25 He wrote a letter with this message£º
44Ac 23:26 "From£º Claudius Lysias To£º Governor Felix Greetings, Your Excellency£º
44Ac 23:27 This man had been seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I went with the guard and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.
44Ac 23:28 I wanted to know the exact charge they were making against him, so I had him brought before their Council.
44Ac 23:29 I found that, although he was charged with questions about their law, there was no charge against him deserving death or imprisonment.
44Ac 23:30 Since a plot against the man has been reported to me, I am at once sending him to you and have also ordered his accusers to present their charges against him before you."2823
44Ac 23:31 So the soldiers, in keeping with their orders, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
44Ac 23:32 The next day they let the horsemen ride with Paul while they returned to their barracks.
44Ac 23:33 When these men came to Caesarea, they delivered the letter to the governor and handed Paul over to him.
44Ac 23:34 After reading the letter, the governor asked which province Paul was from. On learning that he was from Cilicia,
44Ac 23:35 he said, "I will hear your case when your accusers arrive." Then he ordered Paul to be kept in custody in Herod's palace.
44Ac 24:1 Five days later, the high priest Ananias arrived with certain elders and Tertullius, an attorney, and they summarized their case against Paul before the governor.
44Ac 24:2 When Paul had been summoned, Tertullius opened the prosecution by saying£º "Your Excellency Felix, since we are enjoying lasting peace because of you, and since reforms for this nation are being brought about through your foresight,
44Ac 24:3 we always and everywhere acknowledge it with profound gratitude.
44Ac 24:4 But so as not to detain you any further, I beg you to hear us briefly with your customary graciousness.
44Ac 24:5 For we have found this man a perfect pest and an agitator among all Jews throughout the world. He is a ringleader in the sect of the Nazarenes
44Ac 24:6 and even tried to profane the temple, but we arrested him.
44Ac 24:7 ...
44Ac 24:8 By examining him for yourself, you will be able to find out from him everything of which we accuse him."7
44Ac 24:9 The Jews supported his accusations by asserting that these things were true.
44Ac 24:10 When the governor motioned for Paul to speak, he replied£º "Since I know that you have been a judge over this nation for many years, I am pleased to present my defense.
44Ac 24:11 You can verify for yourself that I went up to worship in Jerusalem no more than twelve days ago.
44Ac 24:12 They never found me debating with anyone in the temple or stirring up a crowd in the synagogues or throughout the city,
44Ac 24:13 and they cannot prove to you the charges they are now bringing against me.
44Ac 24:14 However, I admit to you that in accordance with the Way, which they call a heresy, I worship the God of our ancestors and believe in everything written in the Law and the Prophets.
44Ac 24:15 I have the same hope in God that they themselves cherish - that there is to be a resurrection of the righteous and the wicked.
44Ac 24:16 Therefore, I always do my best to have a clear conscience before God and people.
44Ac 24:17 After many years I have come back to my people to bring gifts for the poor and to offer sacrifices.
44Ac 24:18 They found me in the temple doing these things just as I had completed the purification ceremony. No crowd or noisy mob was present.
44Ac 24:19 But some Jews from Asia were there, and they should be here before you to accuse me if they have anything against me.
44Ac 24:20 Otherwise, these men themselves should tell what wrong they found when I stood before the Council - 
44Ac 24:21 unless it is for the one thing I shouted as I stood among them£º 'It is for the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you today.'" 
44Ac 24:22 Felix was rather well informed about the Way, and so he adjourned the trial with the comment, "When Tribune Lysias arrives, I will decide your case."
44Ac 24:23 He ordered the centurion to guard Paul but to let him have some freedom and not to keep any of his friends from caring for his needs.24
44Ac 24:24 Some days later, Felix arrived with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish. He sent for Paul and listened to him talk about faith in Jesus the Messiah.
44Ac 24:25 As Paul talked about righteousness, self-control, and the coming judgment, Felix became afraid and said, "For the present you may go. When I get a chance, I will send for you again."
44Ac 24:26 At the same time he was hoping to receive a bribe from Paul, and so he would send for him frequently to talk with him.
44Ac 24:27 After two years had passed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. Since Felix wanted to do the Jews a favor, he left Paul in prison. 
44Ac 25:1 Three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
44Ac 25:2 The high priests and Jewish leaders informed him of their charges against Paul, urging
44Ac 25:3 and asking Festus to have Paul brought to Jerusalem as a favor. They were laying an ambush to kill him on the road.
44Ac 25:4 Festus replied that Paul was being kept in custody at Caesarea and that he himself would be going there soon.
44Ac 25:5 "Therefore," he said, "have your authorities come down with me and present their charges against him there, if there is anything wrong with the man." 
44Ac 25:6 Festus stayed with them no more than eight or ten days and then went down to Caesarea. The next day he sat on the judge's seat and ordered Paul brought in.
44Ac 25:7 When Paul arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem surrounded him and began bringing a number of serious charges against him that they couldn't prove.
44Ac 25:8 Paul said in his defense, "I have done nothing wrong against the law of the Jews, or of the temple, or of the emperor." 
44Ac 25:9 Then Festus, wanting to do the Jews a favor, asked Paul, "Are you willing to go up to Jerusalem to be tried there before me on these charges?" 
44Ac 25:10 But Paul said, "I am standing before the emperor's judgment seat where I ought to be tried. I haven't done anything wrong to the Jews, as you know very well.
44Ac 25:11 If I am guilty and have done something that deserves death, I am willing to die. But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can hand me over to them as a favor. I appeal to the emperor!" 
44Ac 25:12 Festus talked it over with the council and then answered, "To the emperor you have appealed; to the emperor you will go!"
44Ac 25:13 After several days had passed, King Agrippa and Bernice came to Caesarea to welcome Festus.
44Ac 25:14 Since they were staying there for several days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king. He said, "There is a man here who was left in prison by Felix.
44Ac 25:15 When I went to Jerusalem, the high priests and the Jewish elders informed me about him and asked me to condemn him.
44Ac 25:16 I answered them that it was not the Roman custom to sentence a man to be punished until the accused met his accusers face to face and had an opportunity to defend himself against the charge. 
44Ac 25:17 "So they came here with me, and the next day without any delay I sat down in the judge's seat and ordered the man to be brought in.
44Ac 25:18 When his accusers stood up, they didn't accuse him of any of the crimes I was expecting.
44Ac 25:19 Instead, they had several arguments with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus who had died but whom Paul kept claiming was alive.
44Ac 25:20 I was puzzled how I should investigate such matters, so I asked if he would like to go to Jerusalem and be tried there for these things.
44Ac 25:21 But Paul appealed his case and asked to be held in prison until the decision of his Majesty. So I ordered him to be held in custody until I could send him to the emperor."20
44Ac 25:22 Agrippa told Festus, "I would like to hear the man." "Tomorrow," he said, "you will hear him." 
44Ac 25:23 The next day Agrippa and Bernice arrived with much fanfare and went into the auditorium along with the tribunes and the leading men of the city. At the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
44Ac 25:24 Then Festus said, "King Agrippa and all you men who are present with us! You see this man about whom the whole Jewish nation petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
44Ac 25:25 I find that he has not done anything deserving of death. But since he has appealed to his Majesty, I have decided to send him.
44Ac 25:26 I have nothing reliable to write our Sovereign about him, so I have brought him to all of you, and especially to you, King Agrippa, so that I will have something to write after he is cross-examined.
44Ac 25:27 For it seems to me absurd to send a prisoner without specifying the charges against him."
44Ac 26:1 Then Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak for yourself." So Paul stretched out his hand and began his defense. 
44Ac 26:2 "I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, that I can defend myself today against all the accusations of the Jews,
44Ac 26:3 since you are especially familiar with all the Jewish customs and controversies. I beg you, therefore, to listen patiently to me.
44Ac 26:4 All the Jews know how I lived from the earliest days of my youth with my own people and in Jerusalem.
44Ac 26:5 They have known for a long time, if they would but testify to it, that I lived as a Pharisee, adhering to the standards of our strictest religious party.
44Ac 26:6 "And now I stand here on trial for the hope of the promise made by God to our ancestors.
44Ac 26:7 Our twelve tribes, worshiping day and night with intense devotion, hope to attain it. It is because of this hope, O King, that I am accused by the Jews.
44Ac 26:8 Why is it thought incredible by all of you that God should raise the dead - 
44Ac 26:9 Indeed, I myself thought it my duty to take extreme measures against the name of Jesus from Nazareth.
44Ac 26:10 That is what I did in Jerusalem. I received authority from the high priests and locked many of the saints in prison. And when I cast my vote against them, they were put to death.
44Ac 26:11 I would even punish them frequently in every synagogue and try to make them blaspheme. Raging furiously against them, I would hunt them down even in distant cities. 
44Ac 26:12 "That is how I happened to be traveling to Damascus with authority based on a commission from the high priests.
44Ac 26:13 On the road at noon, O King, I saw a light from heaven that was brighter than the sun. It flashed around me and those who were traveling with me.
44Ac 26:14 "All of us fell to the ground, and I heard a voice asking me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul! Saul! Why are you persecuting me? It is hurting you to keep on kicking against the cattle prods.'
44Ac 26:15 "I asked, 'Who are you, Lord?' "The Lord answered, 'I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
44Ac 26:16 But get up and stand on your feet, for I have appeared to you for the very purpose of appointing you to be my servant and witness of what you have seen and of what I will show you.
44Ac 26:17 I will continue to rescue you from your people and from the gentiles to whom I am sending you.
44Ac 26:18 You will help them understand and turn them from darkness to light and from Satan's control to God, so that their sins will be forgiven and they will receive a share among those who are sanctified by faith in me.' 
44Ac 26:19 "And so, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision.
44Ac 26:20 Instead, I first told the people in Damascus and Jerusalem, then all the people in Judea - and after that the gentiles - to repent, turn to God, and perform deeds that are consistent with such repentance.
44Ac 26:21 For this reason the Jews grabbed me in the temple and kept trying to kill me.
44Ac 26:22 I have had help from God to this day, and so I stand here to testify to both the powerful and the lowly alike, stating only what the prophets and Moses said would happen - 
44Ac 26:23 that the Messiah would suffer and be the first to rise from the dead and would bring light both to our people and to the gentiles." 
44Ac 26:24 As he continued his defense, Festus shouted, "You're out of your mind, Paul! Too much education is driving you crazy!" 
44Ac 26:25 But Paul said, "I'm not out of my mind, Your Excellency Festus. I'm reporting what is absolutely true.
44Ac 26:26 Indeed, the king knows about these things, and I can speak to him freely. For I am certain that none of these things has escaped his notice, since this wasn't done in a corner.
44Ac 26:27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know you believe them!"
44Ac 26:28 Agrippa asked Paul, "Can you so quickly persuade me to become a Christian?"2626
44Ac 26:29 Paul replied, "Whether quickly or not, I wish to God that not only you but everyone listening to me today would become what I am - except for these chains!" 
44Ac 26:30 Then the king, the governor, Bernice, and those who were sitting with him got up.
44Ac 26:31 As they were leaving, they began to say to each other, "This man hasn't been doing anything to deserve death or imprisonment." 
44Ac 26:32 Agrippa told Festus, "This man could have been set free if he hadn't appealed to the emperor." 
44Ac 27:1 When it was decided that we should sail to Italy, Paul and some other prisoners were transferred to a centurion named Julius, who belonged to the emperor's division.
44Ac 27:2 After boarding a ship from Adramyttium that was about to sail to the ports on the coast of Asia, we put out to sea. Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica, went with us.1
44Ac 27:3 The next day we arrived at Sidon, and Julius treated Paul kindly and allowed him to visit his friends there and receive any care he needed.
44Ac 27:4 After putting out from there, we sailed on the sheltered side of Cyprus because the winds were against us.
44Ac 27:5 We sailed along the sea off Cilicia and Pamphylia and reached Myra in Lycia.
44Ac 27:6 There the centurion found an Alexandrian ship bound for Italy and put us on it.
44Ac 27:7 We sailed slowly for a number of days and with difficulty arrived off Cnidus. Then, because the wind was against us, we sailed on the sheltered side of Crete off Cape Salome.
44Ac 27:8 Sailing past it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near the town of Lasea.
44Ac 27:9 Much time had been lost, and because navigation had become dangerous and the day of fasting had already past, Paul began to warn those on the ship,
44Ac 27:10 "Men, I see that during this voyage there will be hardship and a heavy loss not only of the cargo and ship, but also of our lives."
44Ac 27:11 But the centurion was persuaded by the pilot and the owner of the ship and not by what Paul said.
44Ac 27:12 Since the harbor was not a good place to spend the winter, most of the men favored putting out to sea from there on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix and spend the winter there. It is a Cretian harbor that faces southwest and northwest.
44Ac 27:13 When a gentle breeze began to blow from the south, they thought they could make it to Phoenix, so they hoisted anchor and began sailing along the shore of Crete.
44Ac 27:14 But it was not long before a violent wind (called a northeaster) swept down from the island.
44Ac 27:15 The ship was caught so that it couldn't face the wind, and we gave up and were swept along.
44Ac 27:16 As we drifted to the sheltered side of a small island called Cauda, we barely managed to secure the ship's lifeboat.
44Ac 27:17 The ship's crew pulled it up on deck and used ropes to brace the ship. Fearing that they would hit the large sandbank near Lybia, they lowered the sail and drifted along.
44Ac 27:18 The next day, because we were being tossed so violently by the storm, they began to throw the cargo overboard.
44Ac 27:19 On the third day they threw the ship's equipment overboard with their own hands.
44Ac 27:20 For a number of days neither the sun nor the stars were to be seen, and the storm continued to rage until at last all hope of our being saved vanished.16
44Ac 27:21 After they had gone a long time without food, Paul stood among his shipmates and said, "Men, you should have listened to me and not have sailed from Crete. You would have avoided this hardship and damage.
44Ac 27:22 But now I urge you to have courage because there will be no loss of life among you, but only loss of the ship.
44Ac 27:23 For just last night an angel of God, to whom I belong and whom I serve, stood by me
44Ac 27:24 and said, 'Stop being afraid, Paul! You must stand before the emperor. Indeed, God has given to you the lives of everyone who is sailing with you.'
44Ac 27:25 So take courage, men, because I trust God that it will turn out just as he told me.
44Ac 27:26 However, we will have to run aground on some island." 
44Ac 27:27 It was the fourteenth night, and we were drifting through the Adriatic Sea when about midnight the sailors suspected that land was near.
44Ac 27:28 After taking soundings, they found the depth to be twenty fathoms. A little later they took soundings again and found it was fifteen fathoms.
44Ac 27:29 Fearing that we might run aground on the rocks, they dropped four anchors from the stern and began praying for daylight to come.
44Ac 27:30 Meanwhile, the sailors had begun trying to escape from the ship. They lowered the lifeboat into the sea and pretended that they were going to lay out the anchors from the bow.
44Ac 27:31 Paul told the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men remain onboard, you cannot be saved."
44Ac 27:32 Then the soldiers cut the ropes that held the lifeboat and set it adrift.29
44Ac 27:33 Right up to daybreak Paul kept urging all of them to eat something. He said, "Today is the fourteenth day that you have been waiting and going without food, not eating anything.
44Ac 27:34 So I urge you to eat something, for it will help you survive, since none of you will lose so much as a hair from his head."
44Ac 27:35 After he said this, he took some bread, thanked God in front of everyone, broke it, and began to eat.
44Ac 27:36 Everyone was encouraged and had something to eat.
44Ac 27:37 There were276 of us on the ship.
44Ac 27:38 After they had eaten all they wanted, they began to lighten the ship by dumping its cargo of wheat into the sea.2733
44Ac 27:39 When day came, they didn't recognize the land, but they could see a bay with a beach on which they planned to run the ship ashore, if possible.
44Ac 27:40 So they cut the anchors free and left them in the sea. At the same time they untied the ropes that held the steering oars, raised the foresail to the wind, and headed for the beach.
44Ac 27:41 But they struck a sandbar and ran the ship aground. The bow stuck and couldn't be moved, while the stern was broken to pieces by the force of the waves.
44Ac 27:42 The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners to keep them from swimming ashore and escaping,
44Ac 27:43 but the centurion wanted to save Paul, so he prevented them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and get to land.
44Ac 27:44 The rest were to follow, some on planks and others on various pieces of the ship. In this way everyone got to shore safely.2740
44Ac 28:1 When we were safely on shore, we learned that the island was called Malta.
44Ac 28:2 The people who lived there were unusually kind to us. It had started to rain and was cold, so they started a bonfire and invited us to join them around it.
44Ac 28:3 Paul gathered a bundle of sticks and put it on the fire. A poisonous snake was forced out by the heat and attached itself to Paul's hand.
44Ac 28:4 When the people who lived there saw the snake hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "This man must be a murderer! He may have escaped from the sea, but Justice won't let him live."
44Ac 28:5 But he shook the snake into the fire and wasn't harmed.
44Ac 28:6 They were expecting him to swell up or suddenly drop dead, but after waiting a long time and seeing nothing unusual happen to him, they changed their minds and said he was a god. 
44Ac 28:7 The governor of the island, whose name was Publius, owned estates in that part of the island. He welcomed us and entertained us with great hospitality for three days.
44Ac 28:8 The father of Publius happened to be sick in bed with fever and dysentery. Paul went to him, prayed, and healed him by placing his hands on him.
44Ac 28:9 After that had happened, the rest of the sick people on the island went to him and were healed.
44Ac 28:10 The islanders honored us in many ways, and when we were about to sail again, they supplied us with everything we needed. 
44Ac 28:11 Three months later, we continued our sailing onboard an Alexandrian ship that had spent the winter at the island. It had the Twin Brothers as its figurehead.
44Ac 28:12 We stopped at Syracuse and stayed there for three days.
44Ac 28:13 Then we weighed anchor and came to Rhegium. A day later a south wind began to blow, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.
44Ac 28:14 There we found some brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. After this, we arrived in Rome.
44Ac 28:15 The brothers there heard about us and came as far as the Forum of Appius and the Three Taverns to meet us. When Paul saw them, he thanked God and felt encouraged.
44Ac 28:16 When we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to live by himself with the soldier who was guarding him. 
44Ac 28:17 Three days later, Paul called the leaders of the Jews together. When they assembled, he said to them, "Brothers, although I haven't done anything against our people or the customs of our ancestors, I was arrested in Jerusalem and handed over to the Romans.
44Ac 28:18 They examined me and wanted to let me go because there was no reason for me to receive the death penalty in my case.
44Ac 28:19 But the Jews objected and forced me to appeal to the emperor, even though I have no countercharge to bring against my own people.
44Ac 28:20 That's why I asked to see you and speak with you, since it is for the hope of Israel that I'm wearing this chain."
44Ac 28:21 The Jewish leaders told him, "We haven't received any letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or mentioned anything bad about you.
44Ac 28:22 However, we would like to hear from you what you believe, because people are talking against this sect everywhere."
44Ac 28:23 So they set a day to meet with Paul and came out in large numbers to see him where he was staying. From morning until evening he continued to explain the kingdom of God to them, trying to convince them about Jesus from the law of Moses and the Prophets.
44Ac 28:24 Some of them were convinced by what he said, but others wouldn't believe.
44Ac 28:25 They disagreed with one another as they were leaving, so Paul added this statement£º "The Holy Spirit was so right when he spoke to your ancestors through the prophet Isaiah!
44Ac 28:26 He said, 'Go to this people and say, "You will listen and listen but never understand, and you will look and look but never see!
44Ac 28:27 For this people's minds have become stupid, and their ears can barely hear, and they have shut their eyes so that they may never see with their eyes, and listen with their ears, and understand with their heart and turn and let me heal them."'
44Ac 28:28 You must understand that this message about God's salvation has been sent to the gentiles, and they will listen."
44Ac 28:29 ...
44Ac 28:30 For two whole years Paul lived in his own rented place and welcomed everyone who came to him.
44Ac 28:31 He continued to preach about the kingdom of God and to teach boldly and freely about the Lord Jesus, the Messiah.
45
45Rm 1:1 From£º Paul, a servant of Jesus the Messiah, called to be an apostle and set apart for God's gospel,
45Rm 1:2 which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures
45Rm 1:3 regarding his Son. He was a descendant of David with respect to his humanity
45Rm 1:4 and was declared by the resurrection from the dead to be the powerful Son of God according to the spirit of holiness - Jesus the Messiah, our Lord.
45Rm 1:5 Through him we received grace and a commission as an apostle to bring about faithful obedience among all the gentiles for the sake of his name.
45Rm 1:6 You, too, are among those who have been called to belong to Jesus the Messiah.
45Rm 1:7 To£º Everyone in Rome, loved by God and called to be holy. May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be yours! 
45Rm 1:8 First of all, I thank my God through Jesus the Messiah for all of you, because the news about your faith is being reported throughout the world.
45Rm 1:9 For God, whom I serve with my spirit by preaching the gospel about his Son, is my witness how constantly I mention you
45Rm 1:10 in my prayers at all times, asking that somehow by God's will I may at last succeed in coming to you.
45Rm 1:11 For I am longing to see you so that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to make you strong,
45Rm 1:12 that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine. 
45Rm 1:13 I do not want you to be unaware, brothers, that I often planned to come to you (but have been prevented from doing so until now), so that I might reap a harvest among you, just as I have among the rest of the gentiles.
45Rm 1:14 Both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish people, I am a debtor.
45Rm 1:15 That is why I am so eager to proclaim the gospel to you who live in Rome, too.
45Rm 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, because it is God's power for the salvation of everyone who believes, of the Jew first and of the Greek as well.
45Rm 1:17 For in the gospel God's righteousness is being revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, "The righteous will live by faith."
45Rm 1:18 For God's wrath is being revealed from heaven against all the ungodliness and wickedness of those who in their wickedness suppress the truth.
45Rm 1:19 For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God himself has made it plain to them.
45Rm 1:20 For since the creation of the world God's invisible attributes - his eternal power and divine nature - have been understood and observed by what he made, so that people are without excuse.
45Rm 1:21 For although they knew God, they neither glorified him as God nor gave thanks to him. Instead, their thoughts turned to worthless things, and their senseless hearts were darkened.
45Rm 1:22 Though claiming to be wise, they became fools
45Rm 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images that looked like mortal human beings, birds, four-footed animals, and reptiles. 
45Rm 1:24 For this reason, God delivered them to sexual impurity as they followed the lusts of their hearts and dishonored their bodies with one another.
45Rm 1:25 They exchanged God's truth for a lie and worshipped and served the creation rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever. Amen. 
45Rm 1:26 For this reason, God delivered them to degrading passions as their females exchanged their natural sexual function for one that is unnatural.
45Rm 1:27 In the same way, their males also abandoned their natural sexual function toward females and burned with lust toward one another. Males committed indecent acts with males, and received within themselves the appropriate penalty for their perversion.
45Rm 1:28 Furthermore, because they did not think it worthwhile to keep knowing God fully, God delivered them to degraded minds to perform acts that should not be done.
45Rm 1:29 They have become filled with every kind of wickedness, evil, greed, and depravity. They are full of envy, murder, quarreling, deceit, and viciousness. They are gossips,
45Rm 1:30 slanderers, God-haters, haughty, arrogant, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to their parents,
45Rm 1:31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
45Rm 1:32 Although they know God's just requirement - that those who practice such things deserve to die - they not only do these things but even applaud others who practice them.128
45Rm 2:1 Therefore, you have no excuse - every one of you who judges. For when you pass judgment on another person, you condemn yourself, since you, the judge, practice the very same things.
45Rm 2:2 Now we know that God's judgment against those who act like this is based on truth.
45Rm 2:3 So when you, a mere man, pass judgment on those who practice these things and then do them yourself, do you think you will escape God's judgment - 
45Rm 2:4 Or are you unaware of his rich kindness, forbearance, and patience, that it is God's kindness that is leading you to repent - 
45Rm 2:5 But because of your stubborn and unrepentant heart you are reserving wrath for yourself on the day of wrath, when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.
45Rm 2:6 For he will repay everyone according to what that person has done£º
45Rm 2:7 eternal life to those who strive for glory, honor, and immortality by patiently doing good;
45Rm 2:8 but wrath and fury for those who in their selfish pride refuse to believe the truth and practice wickedness instead.
45Rm 2:9 There will be suffering and anguish for every human being who practices doing evil, for Jews first and for Greeks as well.
45Rm 2:10 But there will be glory, honor, and peace for everyone who practices doing good, initially for Jews but also for Greeks as well,
45Rm 2:11 because God does not show partiality.
45Rm 2:12 For all who have sinned apart from the law will also perish apart from the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
45Rm 2:13 For it is not merely those who hear the law who are righteous in God's sight. No, it is those who follow the law, who will be justified.
45Rm 2:14 For whenever gentiles, who do not possess the law, do instinctively what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.
45Rm 2:15 They show that what the law requires is written in their hearts, a fact to which their own consciences testify, and their thoughts will either accuse or excuse them
45Rm 2:16 on that day when God, through Jesus the Messiah, will judge people's secrets according to my gospel.214
45Rm 2:17 Now if you call yourself a Jew, and rely on the law, and boast about God,
45Rm 2:18 and know his will, and approve of what is best because you have been instructed in the law;
45Rm 2:19 and if you are convinced that you are a guide for the blind, a light to those in darkness,
45Rm 2:20 an instructor of ignorant people, and a teacher of infants because you have the full content of knowledge and truth in the law - 
45Rm 2:21 as you teach others, do you fail to teach yourself? As you preach against stealing, do you steal - 
45Rm 2:22 As you forbid adultery, do you commit adultery? As you abhor idols, do you rob temples - 
45Rm 2:23 As you boast about the law, do you dishonor God by breaking the law - 
45Rm 2:24 As it is written, "God's name is being blasphemed among the gentiles because of you."
45Rm 2:25 For circumcision is valuable if you observe the law, but if you break the law, your having been circumcised has no more value than if you were uncircumcised.
45Rm 2:26 So if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the requirements of the law, his uncircumcision will be regarded as circumcision, won't it - 
45Rm 2:27 The man who is uncircumcised physically but who keeps the law will condemn you who break the law, even though you have the written law and circumcision.
45Rm 2:28 For a person is not a Jew because of his appearance, nor is circumcision something just external and physical.
45Rm 2:29 No, a person is a Jew inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, brought about by the Spirit, not by a written law. That person's praise will come from God, not from people.226
45Rm 3:1 What advantage, then, does the Jew have, or what value is there in circumcision - 
45Rm 3:2 There are all kinds of advantages! First of all, the Jews have been entrusted with the utterances of God.
45Rm 3:3 What if some of the Jews were unfaithful? Their unfaithfulness cannot cancel God's faithfulness, can it - 
45Rm 3:4 Of course not! God is true, even if everyone else is a liar. As it is written, "You are right when you speak, and win your case when you go into court."
45Rm 3:5 But if our unrighteousness serves to confirm God's righteousness, what can we say? God is not unrighteous when he vents his wrath on us, is he? (I am talking in human terms.)
45Rm 3:6 Of course not! Otherwise, how could God judge the world - 
45Rm 3:7 For if through my falsehood God's truthfulness glorifies him even more, why am I still being condemned as a sinner - 
45Rm 3:8 Or can we say - as some people slander us by claiming that we say?"Let's do evil that good may result"? They deserve to be condemned! 
45Rm 3:9 What, then, does this mean? Are we Jews any better off? Not at all! For we have already accused everyone, both Jews and Greeks, of being under the power of sin. 
45Rm 3:10 As it is written, "Not even one person is righteous.
45Rm 3:11 No one understands. No one searches for God.
45Rm 3:12 All have turned away. They have become completely worthless. No one shows kindness, not even one person!
45Rm 3:13 Their throats are open graves. With their tongues they deceive. The venom of poisonous snakes is under their lips.
45Rm 3:14 Their mouths are full of cursing and bitterness.
45Rm 3:15 They run swiftly to shed blood. 
45Rm 3:16 Ruin and misery characterize their lives.
45Rm 3:17 They have not learned the path to peace.
45Rm 3:18 They don't fear God.
45Rm 3:19 Now we know that whatever the law says applies to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be silenced and the whole world held accountable to God.
45Rm 3:20 Therefore, God will not justify any human being by means of the actions prescribed by the law, for through the law comes the full knowledge of sin. 
45Rm 3:21 But now, apart from the law, God's righteousness is revealed and is attested by the Law and the Prophets - 
45Rm 3:22 God's righteousness through the faithfulness of Jesus the Messiah? for all who believe. For there is no distinction among people, 
45Rm 3:23 since all have sinned and continue to fall short of God's glory.
45Rm 3:24 By his grace they are justified freely through the redemption that is in the Messiah Jesus,
45Rm 3:25 whom God offered as a place where atonement by the Messiah's blood would occur through faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because he had waited patiently to deal with sins committed in the past.
45Rm 3:26 He wanted to demonstrate at the present time that he himself is righteous and that he justifies anyone who has the faithfulness of Jesus.
45Rm 3:27 What, then, is there to boast about? That has been eliminated. On what principle? On that of actions? No, but on the principle of faith.
45Rm 3:28 For we maintain that a person is justified by faith apart from the actions prescribed by the law.
45Rm 3:29 Is God the God of the Jews only? Is he not the God of the gentiles, too? Yes, of the gentiles, too,
45Rm 3:30 since there is only one God who will justify the circumcised on the basis of faith and the uncircumcised by that same faith.
45Rm 3:31 Do we, then, abolish the law by this faith? Of course not! Instead, we uphold the law.
45Rm 4:1 What, then, are we to say about Abraham, our human ancestor - 
45Rm 4:2 For if Abraham was justified by actions, he would have had something to boast about - though not before God.
45Rm 4:3 For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."
45Rm 4:4 Now to someone who works, wages are not considered a gift but an obligation.
45Rm 4:5 However, to someone who does not work, but simply believes in the one who justifies the ungodly, his faith is credited as righteousness.
45Rm 4:6 Likewise, David also speaks of the blessedness of the person whom God regards as righteous apart from actions£º5
45Rm 4:7 "How blessed are those whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered!
45Rm 4:8 How blessed is the person whose sins the Lord will never charge against him!"
45Rm 4:9 Now does this blessedness come to the circumcised alone, or also to the uncircumcised? For we say, "Abraham's faith was credited to him as righteousness."
45Rm 4:10 Under what circumstances was it credited? Was he circumcised or uncircumcised? He had not yet been circumcised, but was uncircumcised.
45Rm 4:11 Afterward he received the mark of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. Therefore, he is the ancestor of all who believe while uncircumcised, in order that righteousness may be credited to them.
45Rm 4:12 He is also the ancestor of the circumcised - those who are not only circumcised, but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
45Rm 4:13 For the promise that he would inherit the world did not come to Abraham or to his descendants through the law, but through the righteousness produced by faith.
45Rm 4:14 For if those who were given the law are the heirs, then faith is useless and the promise is worthless,
45Rm 4:15 for the law produces wrath. Now where there is no law, neither can there be any violation of it.
45Rm 4:16 Therefore, the promise is based on faith, so that it may be a matter of grace and may be guaranteed for all of Abraham's descendants - not only for those who were given the law, but also for those who share the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all.
45Rm 4:17 As it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations." Abraham acted in faith when he stood in the presence of God, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence things that don't yet exist.
45Rm 4:18 Hoping in spite of hopeless circumstances, he believed that he would become "the father of many nations," just as he had been told£º "This is how many descendants you will have."
45Rm 4:19 His faith did not weaken when he thought about his own body (which was already as good as dead now that he was about a hundred years old) or about Sarah's inability to have children,
45Rm 4:20 nor did he doubt God's promise out of a lack of faith. Instead, his faith became stronger and he gave glory to God,
45Rm 4:21 being absolutely convinced that God would do what he had promised.
45Rm 4:22 This is why "it was credited to him as righteousness."4
45Rm 4:23 Now the words "it was credited to him" were written not only for him
45Rm 4:24 but also for us. Our faith will be regarded in the same way, if we believe in the one who raised Jesus our Lord from the dead.
45Rm 4:25 He was sentenced to death because of our sins and raised to life to justify us. 
45Rm 5:1 Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
45Rm 5:2 Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace by which we have been established, and we boast because of our hope in God's glory.
45Rm 5:3 Not only that, but we also boast in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,
45Rm 5:4 endurance produces character, and character produces hope.
45Rm 5:5 Now this hope does not disappoint us, because God's love has been poured out into our hearts by the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us.3
45Rm 5:6 For at just the right time, while we were still powerless, the Messiah died for the ungodly.
45Rm 5:7 For it is rare for anyone to die for a righteous person, though somebody might be brave enough to die for a good person.
45Rm 5:8 But God demonstrates his love for us by the fact that the Messiah died for us while we were still sinners. 
45Rm 5:9 Now that we have been justified by his blood, how much more will we be saved from wrath through him!
45Rm 5:10 For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, how much more, having been reconciled, will we be saved by his life!
45Rm 5:11 Not only that, but we also continue to boast about God through our Lord Jesus the Messiah, through whom we have now been reconciled. 
45Rm 5:12 Just as sin entered the world through one man, and death resulted from sin, therefore everyone dies, because everyone has sinned.
45Rm 5:13 Certainly sin was in the world before the law was given, but no record of sin is kept when there is no law.
45Rm 5:14 Nevertheless, death ruled from the time of Adam to Moses, even over those who did not sin in the same way Adam did when he disobeyed. He is a foreshadowing of the one who would come.
45Rm 5:15 But God's free gift is not like Adam's offense. For if many people died as the result of one man's offense, how much more have God's grace and the free gift given through the kindness of one man, Jesus the Messiah, been showered on many people!
45Rm 5:16 Nor can the free gift be compared to what came through the man who sinned. For the sentence that followed one man's offense resulted in condemnation, but the free gift brought justification, even after many offenses.
45Rm 5:17 For if, through one man, death ruled because of that man's offense, how much more will those who receive such overflowing grace and the gift of righteousness rule in life because of one man, Jesus the Messiah!
45Rm 5:18 Consequently, just as one offense resulted in condemnation for everyone, so one act of righteousness results in justification and life for everyone.
45Rm 5:19 For just as through one man's disobedience many people were made sinners, so also through one man's obedience many people will be made righteous.
45Rm 5:20 Now the law crept in so that the offense would increase. But where sin increased, grace increased even more,
45Rm 5:21 so that, just as sin ruled by bringing death, so also grace might rule by bringing justification that results in eternal life through Jesus the Messiah, our Lord.
45Rm 6:1 What should we say, then? Should we go on sinning so that grace may increase - 
45Rm 6:2 Of course not! How can we who died as far as sin is concerned go on living in it? 
45Rm 6:3 Or don't you know that all of us who were baptized into union with the Messiah Jesus were baptized into his death - 
45Rm 6:4 Therefore, through baptism we were buried with him into his death so that, just as the Messiah was raised from the dead by the Father's glory, we too may live an entirely new life.
45Rm 6:5 For if we have become united with him in a death like his, we will certainly also be united with him in a resurrection like his.
45Rm 6:6 We know that our old natures were crucified with him so that our sin-laden bodies might be rendered powerless and we might no longer be slaves to sin.
45Rm 6:7 For the person who has died has been freed from sin. 
45Rm 6:8 Now if we have died with the Messiah, we believe that we will also live with him,
45Rm 6:9 for we know that the Messiah, who was raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has mastery over him.
45Rm 6:10 For when he died, he died once and for all as far as sin is concerned. But now that he is alive, he lives for God.
45Rm 6:11 In the same way, you too must continually consider yourselves dead as far as sin is concerned, but living for God through the Messiah Jesus.
45Rm 6:12 Therefore, do not let sin rule your mortal bodies so that you obey their desires.
45Rm 6:13 Stop offering the parts of your body to sin as instruments of unrighteousness. Instead, offer yourselves to God as people who have been brought from death to life and the parts of your body as instruments of righteousness to God.
45Rm 6:14 For sin will not have mastery over you, because you are not under law but under grace.613
45Rm 6:15 What, then, does this mean? Should we go on sinning because we are not under law but under grace? Of course not!
45Rm 6:16 Don't you know that when you offer yourselves to someone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one you obey - either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness - 
45Rm 6:17 But thank God that, though you were once slaves of sin, you became obedient from your hearts to that form of teaching with which you were entrusted!
45Rm 6:18 And since you have been freed from sin, you have become slaves of righteousness. 
45Rm 6:19 I am speaking in simple terms because of the frailty of your human nature. Just as you once offered the parts of your body as slaves to impurity and to greater and greater disobedience, so now, in the same way, you must offer the parts of your body as slaves to righteousness that leads to sanctification.
45Rm 6:20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were "free" as far as righteousness was concerned.
45Rm 6:21 What benefit did you get from doing those things you are now ashamed of? For those things resulted in death.
45Rm 6:22 But now that you have been freed from sin and have become God's slaves, the benefit you reap is sanctification, and the result is eternal life. For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in union with the Messiah Jesus our Lord. 
45Rm 7:1 Don't you realize, brothers - for I am speaking to people who know the law - that the law can press its claims over a person only as long as he is alive - 
45Rm 7:2 For a married woman is bound by the law to her husband while he is living, but if her husband dies, she is released from the law concerning her husband.
45Rm 7:3 So while her husband is living, she will be called an adulterer if she lives with another man. But if her husband dies, she is free from this law, so that she is not an adulterer if she marries another man. 
45Rm 7:4 In the same way, my brothers, through the Messiah's body you also died as far as the law is concerned, so that you may belong to another person, the one who was raised from the dead, and may bear fruit for God.
45Rm 7:5 For while we were living according to our human nature, sinful passions were at work in our bodies by means of the law, to bear fruit resulting in death.
45Rm 7:6 But now we have been released from the law by dying to what enslaved us, so that we may serve in the new life of the Spirit, not under the old writings.4
45Rm 7:7 What should we say, then? Is the law sinful? Of course not! In fact, I wouldn't have become aware of sin if it had not been for the law. I wouldn't have known what it means to covet if the law had not said, "You must not covet."
45Rm 7:8 But sin seized the opportunity provided by this commandment and produced in me all kinds of sinful desires, since apart from the law, sin is dead.
45Rm 7:9 At one time I was alive without any connection to the law. But when the rule was revealed, sin sprang to life,
45Rm 7:10 and I died. I found that the very rule that was intended to bring life actually brought death.
45Rm 7:11 For sin, seizing the opportunity provided by the rule, deceived me and used it to kill me.
45Rm 7:12 So then, the law itself is holy, and the rule is holy, just, and good.
45Rm 7:13 Now, did something good bring me death? Of course not! But in order that sin might be recognized as being sin, it used something good to cause my death, so that through the rule, sin might become more exposed as being sinful than ever before.
45Rm 7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am merely human, sold as a slave to sin.
45Rm 7:15 I don't understand what I am doing. For I don't practice what I want to do, but instead do what I hate.
45Rm 7:16 Now if I practice what I don't want to do, I am admitting that the law is good.
45Rm 7:17 As it is, I am no longer the one who is doing it, but it is the sin that is living in me.
45Rm 7:18 For I know that nothing good lives in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but I cannot carry it out.
45Rm 7:19 For I don't do the good I want to do, but instead do the evil that I don't want to do.
45Rm 7:20 But if I do what I don't want to do, I am no longer the one who is doing it, but it is the sin that is living in me.719
45Rm 7:21 So I find this to be a principle£º when I want to do what is good, evil is right there with me.
45Rm 7:22 For I delight in the law of God in my inner being,
45Rm 7:23 but I see in my body a different principle waging war with the law in my mind and making me a prisoner of the law of sin that exists in my body.
45Rm 7:24 What a wretched man I am! Who will rescue me from this body that is infected by death - 
45Rm 7:25 Thank God through Jesus the Messiah, our Lord, because with my mind I myself can serve the law of God, even while with my human nature I serve the law of sin.
45Rm 8:1 Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in union with the Messiah Jesus.
45Rm 8:2 For the Spirit's law of life in the Messiah Jesus has set me free from the law of sin and death.
45Rm 8:3 For what the law was powerless to do in that it was weakened by the flesh, God did. By sending his own Son in the form of humanity, he condemned sin by being incarnate,
45Rm 8:4 so that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not live according to human nature but according to the Spirit. 
45Rm 8:5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.
45Rm 8:6 To focus our minds on the human nature leads to death, but to focus our minds on the Spirit leads to life and peace.
45Rm 8:7 That is why the mind that focuses on human nature is hostile toward God. It refuses to submit to the authority of God's law because it is powerless to do so.
45Rm 8:8 Indeed, those who are under the control of human nature cannot please God.
45Rm 8:9 You, however, are not under the control of the human nature but under the control of the Spirit, since God's Spirit lives in you. And if anyone does not have the Spirit of the Messiah, he does not belong to him.
45Rm 8:10 But if the Messiah is in you, your bodies are dead due to sin, but the spirit is alive due to righteousness.
45Rm 8:11 And if the Spirit of the one who raised Jesus from the dead is living in you, then the one who raised the Messiah from the dead will also make your mortal bodies alive by his Spirit who lives in you.10
45Rm 8:12 Consequently, brothers, we are not - with respect to human nature, that is - under an obligation to live according to human nature.
45Rm 8:13 For if you live according to human nature, you are going to die, but if by the Spirit you continually put to death the activities of the body, you will live.
45Rm 8:14 For all who are led by God's Spirit are God's children.
45Rm 8:15 For you have not received a spirit of slavery that leads you into fear again. Instead, you have received the Spirit of adoption by whom we cry out, "Abba! Father!" 
45Rm 8:16 The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are God's children.
45Rm 8:17 Now if we are children, we are heirs - heirs of God and co-heirs with the Messiah - if, in fact, we share in his sufferings in order that we may also share in his glory. 
45Rm 8:18 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that will be revealed to us.
45Rm 8:19 For the creation is eagerly awaiting the revelation of God's children,
45Rm 8:20 because the creation has become subject to futility, though not by anything it did. The one who subjected it did so in the certainty
45Rm 8:21 that the creation itself would also be set free from corrupting bondage in order to share the glorious freedom of God's children.
45Rm 8:22 For we know that all the rest of creation has been groaning with the pains of childbirth up to the present time.
45Rm 8:23 However, not only the creation, but we who have the first fruits of the Spirit also groan inwardly as we eagerly await our adoption, the redemption of our bodies.
45Rm 8:24 For we were saved with this hope in mind. Now a hope that can be observed is not really hope, for who hopes for what can be seen - 
45Rm 8:25 But if we hope for what we do not yet observe, we eagerly wait for it with patience.18
45Rm 8:26 In the same way, the Spirit also helps us in our weakness, since we do not know how to pray as we should. But the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groans too deep for words,
45Rm 8:27 and the one who searches our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit, for the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to God's will.
45Rm 8:28 And we know that for those who love God, that is, for those who are called according to his purpose, all things are working together for good.
45Rm 8:29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that the Son might be the firstborn among many brothers.
45Rm 8:30 And those whom he predestined, he also called; and those whom he called, he also justified; and those whom he justified he also glorified.827
45Rm 8:31 What, then, can we say about all of this? If God is for us, who can be against us - 
45Rm 8:32 The one who did not spare his own Son, but offered him as a sacrifice for all of us, surely will give us all things, along with his Son, won't he - 
45Rm 8:33 Who shall accuse God's elect? It is God who justifies!
45Rm 8:34 Who is the one to condemn? It is the Messiah Jesus who is interceding on our behalf. He died, and more importantly, has been raised and is seated at the right hand of God. 
45Rm 8:35 Who shall separate us from the Messiah's love? Can trouble, distress, persecution, hunger, nakedness, danger, or a violent death do this - 
45Rm 8:36 As it is written, "For your sake we are being put to death all day long. We are thought of as sheep headed for slaughter."
45Rm 8:37 In all these things we are triumphantly victorious due to the one who loved us.
45Rm 8:38 For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor rulers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor powers,
45Rm 8:39 nor anything above, nor anything below, nor anything else in all creation can separate us from the love of God that is ours in union with the Messiah Jesus, our Lord.
45Rm 9:1 I am telling the truth because I belong to the Messiah - I am not lying, and my conscience confirms it by means of the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 9:2 I have deep sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart,
45Rm 9:3 for I could wish that I myself were condemned and cut off from the Messiah for the sake of my brothers, my own people,
45Rm 9:4 who are Israelites. To them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.
45Rm 9:5 To the Israelites belong the patriarchs, and from them, the Messiah descended, who is God over all, the one who is forever blessed. Amen.
45Rm 9:6 Now it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all Israelites truly belong to Israel,
45Rm 9:7 and not all of Abraham's descendants are his true descendants. On the contrary, "It is through Isaac that descendants will be named for you."
45Rm 9:8 That is, it is not merely the children born through natural descent who were regarded as God's children, but it is the children born through the promise who were regarded as descendants.
45Rm 9:9 For this is the language of the promise£º "At this time I will return, and Sarah will have a son."
45Rm 9:10 Not only that, but Rebecca became pregnant by our ancestor Isaac.
45Rm 9:11 Yet before their children had been born or had done anything good or bad (so that God's plan of election might continue to operate
45Rm 9:12 according to his calling and not by actions), Rebecca was told, "The older child will serve the younger one."
45Rm 9:13 So it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."
45Rm 9:14 What can we say, then? God is not unrighteous, is he? Of course not!
45Rm 9:15 For he says to Moses, "I will be merciful to the person I want to be merciful to, and I will be kind to the person I want to be kind to."
45Rm 9:16 Therefore, God's choice does not depend on a person's will or effort, but on God himself, who shows mercy.
45Rm 9:17 For the Scripture says about Pharaoh, "I have raised you up for this very purpose, to demonstrate my power through you and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
45Rm 9:18 Therefore, God has mercy on whomever he chooses, and he hardens the heart of whomever he chooses.
45Rm 9:19 You may ask me, "Then why does God still find fault with anybody? For who can resist his will?"
45Rm 9:20 On the contrary, who are you - mere man that you are - to talk back to God? Can an object that was molded say to the one who molded it, "Why did you make me like this?"
45Rm 9:21 A potter has the right to do what he wants to with his clay, doesn't he? He can make something for a special occasion or something for ordinary use from the same lump of clay.
45Rm 9:22 Now if God wants to demonstrate his wrath and reveal his power, can't he be extremely patient with the objects of his wrath that are made for destruction - 
45Rm 9:23 Can't he also reveal his glorious riches to the objects of his mercy that he has prepared ahead of time for glory - 
45Rm 9:24 including us, whom he also called, not only from the Jews but from the gentiles as well - 
45Rm 9:25 As the Scripture says in Hosea, "Those who are not my people I will call my people, and the one who was not loved I will call my loved one.
45Rm 9:26 In the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' they will be called children of the living God."
45Rm 9:27 Isaiah also calls out concerning Israel, "Although the descendants of Israel are as numerous as the grains of sand on the seashore, only a few will be saved.
45Rm 9:28 For the Lord will carry out his plan decisively, bringing it to completion on the earth."
45Rm 9:29 It is just as Isaiah predicted£º "If the Lord of the Heavenly Armies had not left us some descendants, we would have become like Sodom and would have been compared to Gomorrah."
45Rm 9:30 What can we say, then? Gentiles, who were not pursuing righteousness, have attained righteousness, a righteousness that comes through faith.
45Rm 9:31 But Israel, who pursued righteousness based on the law, did not achieve the law.
45Rm 9:32 Why not? Because they did not pursue it on the basis of faith, but as if it were based on achievements. They stumbled over the stone that causes people to stumble.
45Rm 9:33 As it is written, "Look! I am placing a stone in Zion over which people will stumble? a large rock that will make them fall? and the one who believes in him will never be ashamed."
45Rm 10:1 Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God about the Jews is that they would be saved.
45Rm 10:2 For I can testify on their behalf that they have a zeal for God, but it is not in keeping with full knowledge.
45Rm 10:3 For they are ignorant of the righteousness that comes from God while they try to establish their own, and they have not submitted to God's means to attain righteousness.
45Rm 10:4 For the Messiah is the culmination of the law as far as righteousness is concerned for everyone who believes. 
45Rm 10:5 For Moses writes about the righteousness that comes from the law as follows£º "The person who obeys these things will find life by them."
45Rm 10:6 But the righteousness that comes from faith says, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will go up to heaven?' (that is, to bring the Messiah down),
45Rm 10:7 or 'Who will go down into the depths?' (that is, to bring the Messiah back from the dead)."
45Rm 10:8 But what does it say? "The message is near you. It is in your mouth and in your heart." This is the message about faith that we are proclaiming£º
45Rm 10:9 If you declare with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
45Rm 10:10 For one believes with his heart and is justified, and declares with his mouth and is saved.
45Rm 10:11 The Scripture says, "Everyone who believes in him will never be ashamed."
45Rm 10:12 There is no difference between Jew and Greek, because they all have the same Lord, who gives richly to all who call on him. 
45Rm 10:13 "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
45Rm 10:14 How, then, can people call on someone they have not believed? And how can they believe in someone they have not heard about? And how can they hear without someone preaching - 
45Rm 10:15 And how can people preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are those who bring the good news!"
45Rm 10:16 But not everyone has obeyed the gospel, for Isaiah asks, "Lord, who has believed our message?"
45Rm 10:17 Consequently, faith results from listening, and listening results through the word of the Messiah.14
45Rm 10:18 But I ask, "Didn't they hear?" Certainly they did! In fact, "Their voice has gone out into the whole world, and their words to the ends of the earth."
45Rm 10:19 Again I ask, "Did Israel not understand?" Moses was the first to say, "I will make you jealous by those who are not a nation; I will make you angry by a nation that doesn't understand."
45Rm 10:20 And Isaiah boldly says, "I was found by those who were not looking for me; I was revealed to those who were not asking for me."
45Rm 10:21 But about Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and rebellious people."
45Rm 11:1 So I ask, "God has not rejected his people, has he?" Of course not! I am an Israelite myself, a descendant of Abraham from the tribe of Benjamin.
45Rm 11:2 God has not rejected his people whom he chose long ago. Do you not know what the Scripture says in the story about Elijah, when he pleads with God against Israel - 
45Rm 11:3 "Lord, they have killed your prophets and demolished your altars. I am the only one left, and they are trying to take my life."
45Rm 11:4 But what was the divine reply to him? "I have reserved for myself 7,000 people who have not knelt to worship Baal."
45Rm 11:5 So it is at the present time£º there is a remnant, chosen by grace.
45Rm 11:6 But if this is by grace, then it is no longer on the basis of actions. Otherwise, grace would no longer be grace. 
45Rm 11:7 What, then, does this mean? It means that Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking, but the selected group obtained it while the rest were hardened.
45Rm 11:8 As it is written, "To this day God has put them into deep sleep. Their eyes do not see, and their ears do not hear."
45Rm 11:9 And David says, "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a punishment for them.
45Rm 11:10 Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and keep their backs forever bent."
45Rm 11:11 And so I ask, "They have not stumbled so as to fall, have they?" Of course not! On the contrary, because of their stumbling, salvation has come to the gentiles to make the Jews jealous.
45Rm 11:12 Now if their stumbling means riches for the world, and if their fall means riches for the gentiles, how much more will their full participation mean!
45Rm 11:13 I am speaking to you gentiles. Because I am an apostle to the gentiles, I magnify my ministry
45Rm 11:14 in the hope that I can make my people jealous and save some of them.
45Rm 11:15 For if their rejection results in reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance bring but life from the dead - 
45Rm 11:16 If the first part of the dough is holy, so is the whole batch. If the root is holy, so are the branches. 
45Rm 11:17 Now if some of the branches have been broken off, and you, a wild olive branch, have been grafted in their place to share the rich root of the olive tree,
45Rm 11:18 do not boast about being better than the other branches. If you boast, remember that you do not support the root, but the root supports you.
45Rm 11:19 Then you will say, "Branches were cut off so that I could be grafted in."
45Rm 11:20 That's right! They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you remain only because of faith. Do not be arrogant, but be afraid!
45Rm 11:21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, he certainly will not spare you, either.
45Rm 11:22 Consider, then, the kindness and severity of God£º his severity toward those who fell, but God's kindness toward you - if you continue receiving his kindness. Otherwise, you too will be cut off.
45Rm 11:23 If the Jews do not persist in their unbelief, they will be grafted in again, because God is able to graft them in.
45Rm 11:24 After all, if you were cut off from what is naturally a wild olive tree, and contrary to nature were grafted into a cultivated olive tree, how much easier it will be for these natural branches to be grafted back into their own olive tree!
45Rm 11:25 For I want to let you know about this secret, brothers, so that you will not claim to be wiser than you are£º Stubbornness has come to part of Israel until the full number of the gentiles comes to faith.
45Rm 11:26 In this way, all Israel will be saved, as it is written, "The Deliverer will come from Zion; he will remove ungodliness from Jacob.
45Rm 11:27 This is my covenant with them when I take away their sins."
45Rm 11:28 As far as the gospel is concerned, they are enemies for your sake, but as far as election is concerned, they are loved for the sake of their ancestors.
45Rm 11:29 For God's gifts and calling never change.
45Rm 11:30 For just as you disobeyed God in the past but now have received his mercy because of their disobedience,
45Rm 11:31 so they, too, have now disobeyed. As a result, they may receive mercy because of the mercy shown to you.
45Rm 11:32 For God has locked all people in the prison of their own disobedience so that he may have mercy on them all.
45Rm 11:33 O how deep are God's riches, and wisdom, and knowledge! How unfathomable are his decisions and unexplainable are his ways!
45Rm 11:34 Who has known the mind of the Lord? Or who has become his adviser - 
45Rm 11:35 Or who has given him something only to have him pay it back?"
45Rm 11:36 For all things are from him, by him, and for him. Glory belongs to him forever! Amen. 
45Rm 12:1 I therefore urge you, brothers, in view of God's mercies, to offer your bodies as living sacrifices that are holy and pleasing to God, for this is the reasonable way for you to worship.
45Rm 12:2 Do not be conformed to this world, but continually be transformed by the renewing of your minds so that you may be able to determine what God's will is - what is proper, pleasing, and perfect. 
45Rm 12:3 For by the grace given to me I ask every one of you not to think of yourself more highly than you should think, rather to think of yourself with sober judgment on the measure of faith that God has assigned each of you.
45Rm 12:4 For we have many parts in one body, but these parts do not all have the same function.
45Rm 12:5 In the same way, even though we are many people, we are one body in the Messiah and individual parts connected to each other.
45Rm 12:6 We have different gifts based on the grace that was given to us. So if your gift is prophecy, use your gift in proportion to your faith.
45Rm 12:7 If your gift is serving, devote yourself to serving others. If it is teaching, devote yourself to teaching others.
45Rm 12:8 If it is encouraging, devote yourself to encouraging others. If it is sharing, share generously. If it is leading, lead enthusiastically. If it is helping, help cheerfully.3
45Rm 12:9 Your love must be without hypocrisy. Abhor what is evil; cling to what is good.
45Rm 12:10 Be devoted to each other with mutual affection. Excel at showing respect for each other.
45Rm 12:11 Never be lazy in showing such devotion. Be on fire with the Spirit. Serve the Lord.
45Rm 12:12 Be joyful in hope, patient in trouble, and persistent in prayer.
45Rm 12:13 Supply the needs of the saints. Extend hospitality to strangers. 
45Rm 12:14 Bless those who persecute you. Keep on blessing them, and never curse them.
45Rm 12:15 Rejoice with those who are rejoicing. Cry with those who are crying.
45Rm 12:16 Live in harmony with each other. Do not be arrogant, but associate with humble people. Do not think that you are wiser than you really are. 
45Rm 12:17 Do not pay anyone back evil for evil, but focus your thoughts on what is right in the sight of all people.
45Rm 12:18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, live in peace with all people.
45Rm 12:19 Do not take revenge, dear friends, but leave room for God's wrath. For it is written, "Vengeance belongs to me. I will pay them back, declares the Lord."
45Rm 12:20 But "if your enemy is hungry, feed him. For if he is thirsty, give him a drink. If you do this, you will pile burning coals on his head."
45Rm 12:21 Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.
45Rm 13:1 Every person must be subject to the governing authorities, for no authority exists except by God's permission. The existing authorities have been established by God,
45Rm 13:2 so that whoever resists the authorities opposes what God has established, and those who resist will bring judgment on themselves.
45Rm 13:3 For the authorities are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you like to live without being afraid of the authorities? Then do what is right, and you will receive their approval.
45Rm 13:4 For they are God's servants, working for your good. But if you do what is wrong, you should be afraid, for it is not without reason that they bear the sword. Indeed, they are God's servants to administer punishment to anyone who does wrong.
45Rm 13:5 Therefore, it is necessary for you to be acquiescent to the authorities, not only for the sake of God's punishment, but also for the sake of your own conscience.
45Rm 13:6 This is also why you pay taxes. For rulers are God's servants faithfully devoting themselves to their work.
45Rm 13:7 Pay everyone whatever you owe them - taxes to whom taxes are due, tolls to whom tolls are due, fear to whom fear is due, honor to whom honor is due.6 
45Rm 13:8 Do not owe anyone anything - except to love one another. For the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.
45Rm 13:9 For the commandments, "You must not commit adultery; you must not murder; you must not steal; you must not covet," and every other commandment are summed up in this statement£º "You must love your neighbor as yourself."
45Rm 13:10 Love never does anything that is harmful to its neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfillment of the law. 
45Rm 13:11 This is necessary because you know the times - it's already time for you to wake up from sleep, because our salvation is nearer now than when we became believers.
45Rm 13:12 The night is almost over, and the day is near. Let's therefore put aside the actions of darkness and put on the armor of light.
45Rm 13:13 Let's behave decently, as people who live in the light of day. No wild parties, drunkenness, sexual immorality, promiscuity, quarreling, or jealousy!
45Rm 13:14 Instead, clothe yourselves with the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, and do not obey your flesh and its desires.1312
45Rm 14:1 Accept anyone who is weak in faith, but not for the purpose of arguing over differences of opinion.
45Rm 14:2 One person believes that he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables.
45Rm 14:3 The person who eats any kind of food must not ridicule the person who does not eat them, and the person who does not eat certain foods must not criticize the person who eats them, for God has accepted him.
45Rm 14:4 Who are you to criticize someone else's servant? He stands or falls before his own Lord - and stand he will, because the Lord makes him stand.
45Rm 14:5 One person decides in favor of one day over another, while another person decides that all days are the same. Let each one be fully convinced in his own mind£º
45Rm 14:6 The one who observes a special day, observes it to honor the Lord. The one who eats, eats to honor the Lord, since he gives thanks to God. And the one who does not eat, refrains from eating to honor the Lord; yet he, too, gives thanks to God.
45Rm 14:7 For none of us lives for himself, and no one dies for himself.
45Rm 14:8 If we live, we live to honor the Lord; and if we die, we die to honor the Lord. So whether we live or die, we belong to the Lord.
45Rm 14:9 For this reason the Messiah died and returned to life, so that he might become the Lord of both the dead and the living. 
45Rm 14:10 Why, then, do you criticize your brother? Or why do you despise your brother? For all of us will stand before the judgment seat of God.
45Rm 14:11 For it is written, "As certainly as I live, declares the Lord, every knee will bow to me, and every tongue will praise God."
45Rm 14:12 Consequently, each of us will give an account of himself to God. 
45Rm 14:13 Therefore, let's no longer criticize each other. Instead, make up your mind not to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.
45Rm 14:14 I know - and have been persuaded by the Lord Jesus - that nothing is unclean in and of itself, but it is unclean to a person who thinks it is unclean.
45Rm 14:15 For if your brother is being hurt by what you eat, you are no longer acting in love. Do not destroy the person for whom the Messiah died by what you eat.
45Rm 14:16 Do not allow what seems good to you to be spoken of as evil.
45Rm 14:17 For God's kingdom does not consist of food and drink, but of righteousness, peace, and joy produced by the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 14:18 For the person who serves the Messiah in this way is pleasing to God and approved by people.
45Rm 14:19 Therefore, let's keep on pursuing those things that bring peace and that lead to building up one another.
45Rm 14:20 Do not destroy God's action for the sake of food. Everything is clean, but it is wrong to make another person stumble because of what you eat.
45Rm 14:21 The right thing to do is to avoid eating meat, drinking wine, or doing anything else that makes your brother stumble, upset, or weak.
45Rm 14:22 As for the faith you do have, have it as your own conviction before God. How blessed is the person who has no reason to condemn himself because of what he approves!
45Rm 14:23 But the person who has doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not act in faith; and anything that is not done in faith is sin.1421
45Rm 15:1 Now we who are strong ought to be patient with the weaknesses of those who are not strong and must stop pleasing ourselves.
45Rm 15:2 Each of us must please our neighbor for the good purpose of building him up.
45Rm 15:3 For even the Messiah did not please himself. Instead, as it is written, "The insults of those who insult you have fallen on me."
45Rm 15:4 For everything that was written long ago was written to instruct us, so that we might have hope through the endurance and encouragement that the Scriptures give us.
45Rm 15:5 Now may God, the source of endurance and encouragement, allow you to live in harmony with each other as you follow the Messiah Jesus,
45Rm 15:6 so that with one mind and one voice you might glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah. 
45Rm 15:7 Therefore, accept one another, just as the Messiah accepted you, for the glory of God.
45Rm 15:8 For I tell you that the Messiah became a servant of the circumcised on behalf of God's truth in order to confirm the promises given to our ancestors,
45Rm 15:9 so that the gentiles may glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, "That is why I will praise you among the gentiles; I will sing praises to your name."
45Rm 15:10 Again he says, "Rejoice, you gentiles, with his people!"
45Rm 15:11 And again, "Praise the Lord, all you gentiles! Let all the nations praise him."
45Rm 15:12 And again, Isaiah says, "There will be a Root from Jesse. He will rise up to rule the gentiles, and the gentiles will hope in him."
45Rm 15:13 Now may God, the source of hope, fill you with all joy and peace as you believe, so that you may overflow with hope by the power of the Holy Spirit. 
45Rm 15:14 I myself am convinced, my brothers, that you yourselves are filled with goodness and full of all the knowledge you need to be able to instruct each other.
45Rm 15:15 However, on some points I have written to you rather boldly, both as a reminder to you and because of the grace given me by God
45Rm 15:16 to be a minister of the Messiah Jesus to the gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering brought by gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 15:17 Therefore, in the Messiah Jesus I have the right to boast about my work for God.
45Rm 15:18 For I am bold enough to tell you only about what the Messiah has accomplished through me in bringing gentiles to obedience. By my words and actions,
45Rm 15:19 by the power of signs and wonders, and by the power of God's Spirit, I have fully proclaimed the gospel of the Messiah from Jerusalem as far as Illyricum.
45Rm 15:20 My one ambition is to proclaim the gospel where the name of the Messiah is not known, so I don't build on someone else's foundation.
45Rm 15:21 Rather, as it is written, "Those who were never told about him will see, and those who have never heard will understand."
45Rm 15:22 This is why I have so often been hindered from to you.
45Rm 15:23 But now, having no further opportunities in these regions, I want to come to you, as I've desired to do for many years.
45Rm 15:24 Now that I am on my way to Spain, I hope to see you when I come your way and, after I have enjoyed your company for a while, to be sent on by you.23 
45Rm 15:25 Right now, however, I'm going to Jerusalem to minister to the saints,
45Rm 15:26 because the believers in Macedonia and Achaia have been eager to share their resources with the poor among the saints in Jerusalem.
45Rm 15:27 Yes, they were eager to do this, and in fact they are obligated to help them, for if the gentiles have shared in their spiritual blessings, they are obligated to be of service to them in material things. 
45Rm 15:28 So when I have completed this task and have put my seal on this contribution of theirs, I will visit you on my way to Spain.
45Rm 15:29 And I know that when I come to you I will come with the full blessing of the Messiah.
45Rm 15:30 Now I urge you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, and by the love that the Spirit produces, to join me in my struggle, earnestly praying to God for me
45Rm 15:31 that I may be rescued from the unbelievers in Judea, that my ministry to Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,
45Rm 15:32 and that if it's God' will, I may come to you with joy and be refreshed together with you.
45Rm 15:33 Now may the God who grants peace be with all of you! Amen. 
45Rm 16:1 Now I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant in the church at Cenchraea.
45Rm 16:2 Welcome her in the Lord as is appropriate for saints, and provide her with anything she may need from you, for she has assisted many people, including me. 
45Rm 16:3 Greet Prisca and Aquila, who work with me for the Messiah Jesus,
45Rm 16:4 and who risked their necks for my life. I am thankful to them, and so are all the churches among the gentiles.
45Rm 16:5 Greet also the church in their house. Greet my dear friend Epaenetus, who was the first convert to the Messiah in Asia.
45Rm 16:6 Greet Mary, who has worked very hard for you.
45Rm 16:7 Greet Andronicus and Junia, my fellow Jews who are in prison with me and are prominent among the apostles. They belonged to the Messiah before I did.
45Rm 16:8 Greet Ampliatus, my dear friend in the Lord.
45Rm 16:9 Greet Urbanus, our co-worker in the Messiah, and my dear friend Stachys.
45Rm 16:10 Greet Apelles, who has been approved by the Messiah. Greet those who belong to the family of Aristobulus.
45Rm 16:11 Greet Herodion, my fellow Jew. Greet those in the family of Narcissus, who belong to the Lord.
45Rm 16:12 Greet Tryphaena and Tryphosa, who have worked hard for the Lord. Greet my dear friend Persis, who has toiled diligently for the Lord.
45Rm 16:13 Greet Rufus, the one chosen by the Lord, and his mother, who has been a mother to me, too.
45Rm 16:14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them.
45Rm 16:15 Greet Philologus and Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas and all the saints who are with them.
45Rm 16:16 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of the Messiah greet you.7
45Rm 16:17 Now I urge you, brothers, to watch out for those who create divisions and sinful enticements that oppose the teaching you have learned. Stay away from them,
45Rm 16:18 because such people are not serving the Messiah our Lord, but their own desires. By their smooth talk and flattering words they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting.
45Rm 16:19 For your obedience has become known to everyone, and I am full of joy for you. But I want you to be wise about what is good, and innocent about what is evil.
45Rm 16:20 The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. May the grace of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be with all of you!
45Rm 16:21 Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, as do Lucius, Jason, and Sosipater, my fellow Jews.
45Rm 16:22 I, Tertius, who penned this letter, greet you in the Lord.
45Rm 16:23 Gaius, who is host to me and the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus greet you.
45Rm 16:24 May the grace of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be with all of you!
45Rm 16:25 Now to the one who is able to strengthen you with my gospel and the message that I preach about Jesus, the Messiah, by revealing the secret that was kept hidden from long ago
45Rm 16:26 but now has been made known through the prophets to all the gentiles, in keeping with the decree of the eternal God to bring them to the obedience that springs from faith - 
45Rm 16:27 to the only wise God, through Jesus the Messiah, be glory forever! Amen.
46
461Co 1:1 From£º Paul, called to be an apostle of the Messiah Jesus by the will of God, and from our brother Sosthenes.
461Co 1:2 To£º God's church in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified by the Messiah Jesus and called to be holy, together with all those everywhere who call on the name of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah - their Lord and ours.
461Co 1:3 May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be yours!
461Co 1:4 I always thank my God for you because of the grace of God given you by the Messiah Jesus.
461Co 1:5 For by him you have become rich in every way - in speech and knowledge of every kind - 
461Co 1:6 while, our testimony about the Messiah has been confirmed among you.
461Co 1:7 Therefore, you don't lack any spiritual gift as you eagerly wait for our Lord Jesus the Messiah to be revealed.
461Co 1:8 He will keep you strong until the end, so that you will be blameless on the Day of our Lord Jesus the Messiah.
461Co 1:9 Faithful is the God by whom you were called into fellowship with his Son Jesus the Messiah, our Lord. 
461Co 1:10 Brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, I urge all of you to be in agreement and not to have divisions among you, so that you may be perfectly united in your understanding and opinions.
461Co 1:11 My brothers, some members of Chloe's family have made it clear to me that there are quarrels among you.
461Co 1:12 This is what I mean£º Each of you is saying, "I belong to Paul," or "I belong to Apollos," or "I belong to Cephas," or "I belong to the Messiah." 
461Co 1:13 Is the Messiah divided? Paul wasn't crucified for you, was he? You weren't baptized in Paul's name, were you - 
461Co 1:14 I thank God that I did not baptize any of you except Crispus and Gaius,
461Co 1:15 so that no one can say that you were baptized in my name.
461Co 1:16 (Oh yes, I also baptized the family of Stephanus. Beyond that, I'm not sure whether I baptized anyone else.)
461Co 1:17 For the Messiah did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, not with eloquent wisdom, so the cross of the Messiah won't be emptied of its power. 
461Co 1:18 For the message about the cross is nonsense to those who are being destroyed, but it is God's power to us who are being saved.
461Co 1:19 For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the intelligence of the intelligent I will reject."
461Co 1:20 Where is the wise person? Where is the scholar? Where is the philosopher of this age? God has turned the wisdom of the world into nonsense, hasn't he - 
461Co 1:21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world through its wisdom did not know God, God was pleased to save those who believe through the nonsense of our preaching.
461Co 1:22 Jews ask for signs, and Greeks look for wisdom,
461Co 1:23 but we preach the Messiah crucified. He is a stumbling block to Jews and nonsense to gentiles,
461Co 1:24 but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, the Messiah is God's power and God's wisdom.
461Co 1:25 For God's nonsense is wiser than human wisdom, and God's weakness is stronger than human strength.
461Co 1:26 Brothers, think about your own calling. Not many of you were wise by human standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
461Co 1:27 But God chose what is nonsense in the world to make the wise feel ashamed. God chose what is weak in the world to make the strong feel ashamed.
461Co 1:28 And God chose what is insignificant in the world, what is despised, what is nothing, in order to destroy what is something,
461Co 1:29 so that no one may boast in God's presence.
461Co 1:30 It is because of God that you are in union with the Messiah Jesus, who for us has become wisdom from God, as well as our righteousness, sanctification, and redemption.
461Co 1:31 Therefore, as it is written, "The person who boasts must boast in the Lord."130
461Co 2:1 When I came to you, brothers, I didn't come and tell you about God's secret with rhetorical language or wisdom.
461Co 2:2 For while I was with you I resolved to know nothing except Jesus the Messiah, and him crucified.
461Co 2:3 It was in weakness, fear, and great trembling that I came to you.
461Co 2:4 My message and my preaching were not accompanied by clever, wise words, but by a display of the Spirit's power,
461Co 2:5 so that your faith would not be based on human wisdom but on God's power. 
461Co 2:6 However, when we are among mature people, we do speak a message of wisdom, but not the wisdom of this world or of the rulers of this world, who are passing off the scene.
461Co 2:7 Instead, we speak about God's wisdom in a hidden secret, which God destined before the world began for our glory.
461Co 2:8 None of the rulers of this world understood it, because if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
461Co 2:9 But as it is written, "No eye has seen, no ear has heard, and no mind has imagined the things that God has prepared for those who love him."
461Co 2:10 But God has revealed those things to us by his Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the deep things of God. 
461Co 2:11 Is there anyone who can understand his own thoughts except his own inner spirit? In the same way, no one can know the thoughts of God except God's Spirit.
461Co 2:12 Now, we have not received the spirit of the world but the Spirit who comes from God, so that we can understand the things that were freely given to us by God.
461Co 2:13 We don't speak about these things with words taught us by human wisdom, but with words taught by the Spirit, as we explain spiritual things to spiritual people.
461Co 2:14 A person who isn't spiritual doesn't accept the things of God's Spirit, for they are nonsense to him. He can't understand them because they are spiritually evaluated.
461Co 2:15 The spiritual person evaluates everything but is subject to no one else's evaluation.
461Co 2:16 For "Who has known the mind of the Lord so that he can advise him?"However, we have the mind of the Messiah.
461Co 3:1 Brothers, I couldn't talk to you as spiritual people but as worldly people, as mere infants in the Messiah.
461Co 3:2 I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, because you weren't ready for it. And you're still not ready!
461Co 3:3 That's because you are still worldly. As long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you, you are worldly and living by human standards, aren't you - 
461Co 3:4 For when one person says, "I follow Paul," and another person says, "I follow to Apollos," you're following your own human nature, aren't you - 3
461Co 3:5 Who is Apollos, anyhow? Or who is Paul? They're merely servants through whom you came to believe, as the Lord gave to each of us his task.
461Co 3:6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God kept everything growing.
461Co 3:7 So neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is significant, but God, who keeps everything growing, is the one who matters.
461Co 3:8 The one who plants and the one who waters have the same goal, and each will receive a reward for his own action.
461Co 3:9 For we are God's co-workers. You are God's farmland and God's building. 
461Co 3:10 As an expert builder using the grace that God gave me, I laid the foundation, and someone else is building on it. But each person must be careful how he builds on it.
461Co 3:11 After all, no one can lay any other foundation than the one that is already laid, and that is Jesus the Messiah.
461Co 3:12 Whether a person builds on this foundation with gold, silver, expensive stones, wood, hay, or straw,
461Co 3:13 the workmanship of each person will become evident, for the day of judgment will show what it is, because it will be revealed with fire, and the fire will test the quality of each person's action.
461Co 3:14 If what a person has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.
461Co 3:15 If his work is burned up, he will suffer loss. However, he himself will be saved, but it will be like going through fire.313
461Co 3:16 You know that you are God's sanctuary and that God's Spirit lives in you, don't you - 
461Co 3:17 If anyone destroys God's sanctuary, God will destroy him, for God's sanctuary is holy. And you are that sanctuary!
461Co 3:18 Let no one deceive himself. If any of you thinks he is wise in the ways of this world, he must become a fool to become really wise.
461Co 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is nonsense in God's sight. For it is written, "He catches the wise with their own trickery,"
461Co 3:20 and again, "The Lord knows that the thoughts of the wise are worthless."
461Co 3:21 So let no one boast about human beings, since everything belongs to you,
461Co 3:22 whether Paul, Apollos, Cephas, the world, life, death, the present, or the future - everything belongs to you,
461Co 3:23 but you belong to the Messiah, and the Messiah belongs to God. 
461Co 4:1 Think of us as servants of the Messiah and as servant managers entrusted with God's secrets.
461Co 4:2 Now it is required of servant managers that each one should prove to be trustworthy.
461Co 4:3 It is a very small thing to me that I should be examined by you or by any human court. In fact, I don't even evaluate myself.
461Co 4:4 For my conscience is clear, but that does not vindicate me. It is the Lord who examines me.
461Co 4:5 Therefore, stop judging prematurely, before the Lord comes, for he will bring to light what is now hidden in darkness and reveal the motives of our hearts. Then each person will receive his praise from God.3 
461Co 4:6 Brothers, I have applied all this to Apollos and myself for your benefit, so that you may learn from us not to go beyond what the Scriptures say. Then you will stop boasting about one person at the expense of another.4
461Co 4:7 For who makes you superior? What do you have that you did not receive? And if you did receive it, why do you boast as though you did not receive it - 
461Co 4:8 You already have all you want! You have already become rich! You have become kings without us! I wish you really were kings so that we could be kings with you!
461Co 4:9 For it seems to me that God has put us apostles on display in last place, like men condemned to death. We have become a spectacle for the world, for angels, and for people to stare at.
461Co 4:10 We are fools for the Messiah's sake, but you are wise in the Messiah. We are weak, but you are strong. You are honored, but we are dishonored.
461Co 4:11 We are hungry, thirsty, dressed in rags, brutally treated, and homeless, right up to the present.
461Co 4:12 We wear ourselves out from working with our own hands. When insulted, we bless. When persecuted, we endure.
461Co 4:13 When slandered, we answer with kind words. Even now we have become the filth of the world, the scum of the universe.
461Co 4:14 I'm not writing this to make you feel ashamed, but to warn you as my dear children.
461Co 4:15 You may have 10,000 mentors who work for the Messiah, but not many fathers. For in the Messiah Jesus I became your father through the gospel.
461Co 4:16 So I urge you to imitate me.
461Co 4:17 That's why I sent Timothy to you. He is my dear and dependable son in the Lord and will help you remember how I live for the Messiah Jesus as I teach everywhere in every church.
461Co 4:18 Some of you have become arrogant, as though I were not coming to evaluate you.
461Co 4:19 But I will come to you soon if it's the Lord's will. Then I'll discover not only what these arrogant people are saying but also what power they have,
461Co 4:20 for the kingdom of God isn't just talk, but also power.
461Co 4:21 Which do you prefer? Should I come to you with a stick, or with love and a gentle spirit - 
461Co 5:1 It is actually reported that sexual immorality exists among you, and of a kind that is not found even among the gentiles. A man is actually living with his father's wife!
461Co 5:2 And you are being arrogant instead of being filled with grief and seeing to it that the man who did this is removed from among you.
461Co 5:3 Even though I am away from you physically, I am with you in spirit. I have already passed judgment on the man who did this, as though I were present with you.
461Co 5:4 In the name of our Lord Jesus, when you are gathered together (and I am there in spirit), and the power of our Lord Jesus is there, too,
461Co 5:5 turn this man over to Satan for the destruction of his body, so that his spirit may be saved on the Day of the Lord.54
461Co 5:6 Your boasting is not good. You know that a little yeast leavens the whole batch of dough, don't you - 
461Co 5:7 Get rid of the old yeast so that you may be a new batch of dough, since you are to be free from yeast. For the Messiah, our Passover, has been sacrificed.
461Co 5:8 So let's keep celebrating the festival, neither with old yeast nor with yeast that is evil and wicked, but with yeast-free bread that is both sincere and true.
461Co 5:9 I wrote to you in my letter to stop associating with people who are sexually immoral - 
461Co 5:10 not at all meaning the people of this world who are immoral, greedy, robbers, or idolaters. In that case you would have to leave this world.
461Co 5:11 But now I am writing to you to stop associating with any so-called brother if he is sexually immoral, greedy, an idolater, a slanderer, a drunk, or a robber. You must even stop eating with someone like that.
461Co 5:12 After all, is it my business to judge outsiders? You are to judge those who are in the community, aren't you - 
461Co 5:13 God will judge outsiders. "Expel that wicked man."
461Co 6:1 When one of you has a complaint against another, does he dare to take the matter before those who are unrighteous and not before the saints - 
461Co 6:2 You know that the saints will rule the world, don't you? And if the world is going to be ruled by you, can't you handle insignificant cases - 
461Co 6:3 You know that we will rule angels, not to mention things in this life, don't you - 
461Co 6:4 So if you have cases dealing with this life, why do you appoint as judges people who have no standing in the church - 
461Co 6:5 I say this to make you feel ashamed. Has it come to this, that there is not one person among you who is wise enough to settle disagreements between brothers - 
461Co 6:6 Instead, one brother goes to court against another brother, and before unbelieving judges, at that!
461Co 6:7 The very fact that you have lawsuits among yourselves is already a defeat for you. Why not rather just accept the wrong? Why not rather be cheated - 
461Co 6:8 Instead, you yourselves practice doing wrong and cheating others, and brothers at that!1
461Co 6:9 You know that wicked people will not inherit the kingdom of God, don't you? Stop deceiving yourselves! Sexually immoral people, idolaters, adulterers, male prostitutes, homosexuals,
461Co 6:10 thieves, greedy people, drunks, slanderers, and robbers will not inherit the kingdom of God.
461Co 6:11 That is what some of you were! But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of our Lord Jesus the Messiah and by the Spirit of our God. 
461Co 6:12 Everything is permissible for me, but not everything is helpful. Everything is permissible for me, but I will not allow anything to control me.
461Co 6:13 Food is for the stomach, and the stomach is for food, but God will make them both unnecessary. The body is not meant for sexual immorality but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
461Co 6:14 God raised the Lord, and by his power he will also raise us. 
461Co 6:15 You know that your bodies belong to the Messiah, don't you? Should I take what belongs to the Messiah and unite them with a prostitute? Certainly not!
461Co 6:16 You know that the person who unites himself with a prostitute becomes one body with her, don't you? For it is said, "The two will become one flesh."
461Co 6:17 But the person who unites himself with the Lord becomes one spirit with him. 
461Co 6:18 Keep on running away from sexual immorality. Any other sin that a person commits is outside his body, but the person who sins sexually sins against his own body.
461Co 6:19 You know that your body is a sanctuary of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have received from God, don't you? You do not belong to yourselves,
461Co 6:20 because you were bought for a price. Therefore, glorify God with your bodies. 
461Co 7:1 Now about what you asked£º "Is it advisable for a man not to marry?"
461Co 7:2 Because sexual immorality is so rampant, every man should have his own wife, and every woman should have her own husband.
461Co 7:3 A husband should fulfill his obligation to his wife, and a wife should do the same for her husband.
461Co 7:4 A wife does not have authority over her own body, but her husband does. In the same way, a husband doesn't have authority over his own body, but his wife does.
461Co 7:5 Do not withhold yourselves from each other unless you agree to do so just for a set time, in order to devote yourselves to prayer. Then you should come together again so that Satan does not tempt you through your lack of self-control.
461Co 7:6 But I say this as a concession, not as a command.
461Co 7:7 I would like everyone to be unmarried, like I am. However, each person has a special gift from God, one this and another that. 
461Co 7:8 I say to those who are unmarried, especially to widows£º It is good for them to remain like me.
461Co 7:9 However, if they cannot control themselves, they should get married, for it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
461Co 7:10 To married people I give this command (not really I, but the Lord)£º A wife must not leave her husband.
461Co 7:11 But if she does leave him, she must remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband. Likewise, a husband must not abandon his wife.
461Co 7:12 I (not the Lord) say to the rest of you£º If a brother has a wife who is an unbeliever and she is willing to live with him, he must not abandon her.
461Co 7:13 And if a woman has a husband who is an unbeliever and he is willing to live with her, she must not abandon him.
461Co 7:14 For the unbelieving husband has been sanctified because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife has been sanctified because of her husband. Otherwise, your children would be unclean, but now they are holy.
461Co 7:15 But if the unbelieving partner leaves, let him go. In such cases the brother or sister is not under obligation. God has called you to live in peace.
461Co 7:16 Wife, you might be able to save your husband. Husband, you might be able to save your wife.13
461Co 7:17 Nevertheless, everyone should live the life that the Lord gave him and to which God called him. This is my rule in all the churches.
461Co 7:18 Was anyone circumcised when he was called? He should not try to change that. Was anyone uncircumcised when he was called? He should not get circumcised.
461Co 7:19 Circumcision is nothing, and uncircumcision is nothing, but obeying God's commandments is everything.
461Co 7:20 Everyone should stay in the same condition in which he was called.
461Co 7:21 Were you a slave when you were called? Do not let that bother you. Of course, if you have a chance to become free, take advantage of the opportunity.
461Co 7:22 For the slave who has been called to belong to the Lord is the Lord's free person. In the same way, the free person who has been called is the Messiah's slave.
461Co 7:23 You were bought for a price. Stop becoming slaves of people.
461Co 7:24 Brothers, everyone should stay in the same condition in which he was called by God. 
461Co 7:25 Now concerning virgins, although I do not have any command from the Lord, I will give you my opinion as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.
461Co 7:26 In view of the present crisis, I think it is prudent for a man to stay as he is.
461Co 7:27 Have you become committed to a wife? Stop trying to get released from your commitment. Have you been freed from your commitment to a wife? Stop looking for one.
461Co 7:28 But if you do get married, you have not sinned. And if a virgin gets married, she has not sinned. However, these people will experience trouble in this life, and I want to spare you from that.
461Co 7:29 This is what I mean, brothers£º The time is short. From now on, those who have wives should live as though they had none,
461Co 7:30 and those who mourn as though they did not mourn, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they did not own a thing,
461Co 7:31 and those who use the things in the world as though they were not dependent on them. For the world in its present form is passing away. 
461Co 7:32 I want you to be free from concerns. An unmarried man is concerned about the things of the Lord, that is, about how he can please the Lord.
461Co 7:33 But a married man is concerned about things of this world, that is, about how he can please his wife,
461Co 7:34 and so his attention is divided. An unmarried woman or virgin is concerned about the affairs of the Lord, so that she may be holy in body and spirit. But a married woman is concerned about the affairs of this world, that is, about how she can please her husband.
461Co 7:35 I'm saying this for your benefit, not to put a noose around your necks, but to promote good order and unhindered devotion to the Lord.
461Co 7:36 If a man thinks he is not behaving properly toward his virgin, and if his passion is so strong that he feels he ought to marry her, let him do what he wants; he isn't sinning. Let them get married.
461Co 7:37 However, if a man stands firm in his resolve, feels no necessity, and has made up his mind to keep her a virgin, he will be acting appropriately.
461Co 7:38 So then the man who marries the virgin acts appropriately, but the man who refrains from marriage does even better. 
461Co 7:39 A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to marry anyone she wishes, only in the Lord.
461Co 7:40 However, in my opinion she will be happier if she stays as she is. And in saying this, I think that I, too, have God's Spirit.
461Co 8:1 Now concerning food offered to idols£º We know that we all possess knowledge. Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up.
461Co 8:2 If anyone thinks he really knows something, he has not yet learned it as he ought to know it.
461Co 8:3 But anyone who loves God is known by him.
461Co 8:4 Now concerning eating food offered to idols£º We know that no idol is real in this world and that there is only one God.
461Co 8:5 For even if there are "gods" in heaven and on earth (as indeed there are many so-called "gods" and "lords"),
461Co 8:6 yet for us there is only one God, the Father, from whom everything came into being and for whom we live. And there is only one Lord, Jesus the Messiah, through whom everything came into being and through whom we live.
461Co 8:7 But not everyone has this knowledge. Some people are so accustomed to idolatry that when they eat food that has been offered to an idol, their conscience becomes contaminated because it is weak.
461Co 8:8 However, food will not bring us closer to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat food that has been offered to an idol, and no better off if we do. 
461Co 8:9 But you must see to it that this right of yours does not become a stumbling block for those who are weak.
461Co 8:10 For if anyone with a weak conscience sees you, who knows better, eating in an idol's temple, he will be encouraged to eat what has been offered to idols, won't he - 
461Co 8:11 In that case, the weak brother for whom the Messiah died is ruined by your knowledge.
461Co 8:12 When you sin against your brothers in this way and wound their weak consciences, you are sinning against the Messiah.
461Co 8:13 Therefore, if food that I eat causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, in order to keep my brother from stumbling.810
461Co 9:1 I am free, am I not? I am an apostle, am I not? I have seen Jesus our Lord, haven't I? You are the result of my work in the Lord, aren't you - 
461Co 9:2 If I am not an apostle to other people, surely I am one to you, for you are the evidence of my apostolic authority from the Lord.
461Co 9:3 This is my defense to those who would examine me£º
461Co 9:4 We have the right to earn our food, don't we - 
461Co 9:5 We have the right to take a believing wife with us like the other apostles, the Lord's brothers, and Cephas, don't we - 
461Co 9:6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have to keep on working for a living - 
461Co 9:7 Who ever goes to war at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat any of its grapes? Or who takes care of a flock and does not drink any of its milk - 
461Co 9:8 I am not saying this on human authority, am I? The law says the same thing, doesn't it - 
461Co 9:9 For in the law of Moses it is written, "You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading out the grain." God is not only concerned about oxen, is he - 
461Co 9:10 Isn't he really speaking for our benefit? Yes, this was written for our benefit, because the one who plows should plow in hope, and the one who threshes should thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.
461Co 9:11 If we have sown spiritual seed among you, is it too much if we reap material benefits from you - 
461Co 9:12 If others enjoy this right over you, don't we have a stronger claim? But we did not use this right. On the contrary, we tolerate everything in order not to put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of the Messiah. 
461Co 9:13 You know that those who work in the temple get their food from the temple and that those who serve at the altar get their share of its offerings, don't you - 
461Co 9:14 In the same way, the Lord has ordered that those who proclaim the gospel should make their living from the gospel.9
461Co 9:15 But I have not used any of these rights, and I'm not writing this so that they may be applied in my case. I would rather die than let anyone deprive me of my reason for boasting.
461Co 9:16 For if I preach the gospel, I have nothing to boast about, for this obligation has been entrusted to me. How terrible it would be for me if I didn't preach the gospel!
461Co 9:17 For if I preach voluntarily, I get a reward, but if I am unwilling to do it, I am still entrusted with that obligation.
461Co 9:18 What, then, is my reward? It is to be able to preach the gospel free of charge, and so I never resort to demanding my rights when I'm preaching the gospel.
461Co 9:19 Although I am free from everyone's expectations, I have made myself a servant to all of them to win more people.
461Co 9:20 To the Jews I became like a Jew in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became like a man under the law, in order to win those under the law (although I myself am not under the law).
461Co 9:21 To those who do not have the law, I became like a man who does not have the law in order to win those who do not have the law. However, I am not free from God's law, but I'm subject to the Messiah's law.
461Co 9:22 To the weak I became weak in order to win the weak. I have become all things to all people so that by all possible means I might save some of them.
461Co 9:23 I do all this for the sake of the gospel in order to have a share in its blessings.921
461Co 9:24 You know that in a race all the runners run but only one wins the prize, don't you? You must run in such a way that you may be victorious.
461Co 9:25 Everyone who enters an athletic contest practices self-control in everything. They do it to win a wreath that withers away, but we run to win a prize that never fades.
461Co 9:26 That is the way I run, with a clear goal in mind. That is the way I fight, not like someone shadow boxing.
461Co 9:27 No, I keep on disciplining my body, making it serve me so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not somehow be disqualified. 
461Co 10:1 Now I do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of the fact that all of our ancestors who left Egypt were under the cloud. They all went through the sea,
461Co 10:2 and they all were immersed into Moses in the cloud and in the sea.
461Co 10:3 They all ate the same spiritual food
461Co 10:4 and drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from the spiritual rock that went with them. That rock was the Messiah.
461Co 10:5 But God wasn't pleased with most of those people, and so they were struck down in the wilderness.4
461Co 10:6 Now their experiences serve as examples for us so that we won't set our hearts on evil as they did.
461Co 10:7 Let's stop being idolaters, as some of them were. As it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink and got up to play."
461Co 10:8 Let's stop sinning sexually, as some of them were doing, and on a single day 23,000 fell dead.
461Co 10:9 Let's stop putting the Lord to the test, as some of them were doing, and were destroyed by snakes.
461Co 10:10 You must stop complaining, as some of them were doing, and were annihilated by the destroyer.
461Co 10:11 These things happened to them to serve as an example, and they were written down as a warning for us in whom the culmination of the ages has been attained.
461Co 10:12 Therefore, whoever thinks he is standing securely should watch out so he doesn't fall.
461Co 10:13 No temptation has overtaken you that is unusual for human beings. But God is faithful, and he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your strength. Instead, along with the temptation he will also provide a way out, so that you may be able to endure it. 
461Co 10:14 And so, my dear friends, keep on running away from idolatry.
461Co 10:15 I am talking to sensible people. Apply what I am saying to yourselves.
461Co 10:16 The cup of blessing that we bless is a sign of our sharing in the blood of the Messiah, isn't it? The bread that we break is a sign of our sharing in the body of the Messiah, isn't it - 
461Co 10:17 Because there is one loaf, we who are many are one body, because all of us eat from the same loaf. 
461Co 10:18 Look at the Israelites from a human point of view. Those who eat the sacrifices share in what is on the altar, don't they - 
461Co 10:19 Am I suggesting that an offering made to idols means anything, or that an idol itself means anything - 
461Co 10:20 Hardly! What they offer, they offer to demons and not to God, and I do not want you to become partners with demons.
461Co 10:21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot dine with the Lord and dine with demons,
461Co 10:22 or you'll provoke the Lord to jealousy, won't you? Are we are stronger than he is? 
461Co 10:23 Everything is permissible, but not everything is helpful. Everything is permissible, but not everything builds up.
461Co 10:24 No one should seek his own welfare, but rather his neighbor's.10
461Co 10:25 Eat anything that is sold in the meat market without raising any question about it on the grounds of conscience,
461Co 10:26 for "the earth and everything in it belong to the Lord."
461Co 10:27 If an unbeliever invites you to his house and you wish to go, eat whatever is set before you, raising no question on the grounds of conscience.
461Co 10:28 However, if someone says to you, "This was offered as a sacrifice," don't eat it, both out of consideration for the one who told you and also for the sake of conscience.
461Co 10:29 I mean, of course, his conscience, not yours. For why should my freedom be determined by someone else's conscience - 
461Co 10:30 If I eat with thankfulness, why should I be denounced because of what I am thankful for - 2910
461Co 10:31 Therefore, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do everything for the glory of God.
461Co 10:32 Don't become a stumbling block to Jews or Greeks or to the church of God,
461Co 10:33 just as I myself try to please everybody in every way. I don't look out for my own benefit, but rather for the benefit of many people, so that they might be saved.
461Co 11:1 Imitate me, as I do the Messiah.
461Co 11:2 I praise you for remembering everything I told you and for holding to the traditions that I passed on to you.
461Co 11:3 Now I want you to realize that the Messiah is the head of every man, and man is the head of the woman, and God is the head of the Messiah.
461Co 11:4 Every man who prays or prophesies with something on his head dishonors his head,
461Co 11:5 and every woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, which is the same as having her head shaved.
461Co 11:6 So if a woman does not cover her head, she should cut off her hair. If it is a disgrace for a woman to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her own head.3
461Co 11:7 A man should not cover his head, because he exists as God's image and glory. But the woman is man's glory.
461Co 11:8 For man did not come from woman, but woman from man;
461Co 11:9 and man was not created for woman, but woman for man.
461Co 11:10 This is why a woman should have authority over her own head£º because of the angels.
461Co 11:11 In the Lord, however, woman is not independent of man, nor is man of woman.
461Co 11:12 For as woman came from man, so man comes through woman. But everything comes from God.
461Co 11:13 Decide for yourselves£º Is it proper for a woman to pray to God with her head uncovered - 
461Co 11:14 Nature itself teaches you neither that it is disgraceful for a man to have long hair
461Co 11:15 nor that hair is a woman's glory, since hair is given as a substitute for coverings.
461Co 11:16 But if anyone wants to argue about this, we do not have any custom like this, nor do any of God's churches.
461Co 11:17 Now I am not praising you in giving you the following instructions. When you gather, it is not for the better but for the worse.
461Co 11:18 For in the first place, I hear that when you gather as a church there are divisions among you, and I partly believe it.
461Co 11:19 Of course, there must be factions among you to show which of you are genuine!1117
461Co 11:20 When you gather in the same place, it is not to eat the Lord's Supper.
461Co 11:21 For as you eat, each of you rushes to eat his own supper, and one person goes hungry while another gets drunk.
461Co 11:22 You have homes in which to eat and drink, don't you? Or do you despise God's church and humiliate those who have nothing? What should I say to you? Should I praise you? I will not praise you for this! 
461Co 11:23 For I received from the Lord what I also passed on to you - how the Lord Jesus, on the night he was betrayed, took a loaf of bread,
461Co 11:24 gave thanks for it, and broke it in pieces, saying, "This is my body that is for you. Keep doing this in memory of me."
461Co 11:25 He did the same with the cup after the supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. As often as you drink from it, keep doing this in memory of me."
461Co 11:26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink from this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes. 
461Co 11:27 Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks from the cup in an unworthy manner will be held responsible for the Lord's body and blood.
461Co 11:28 A person must examine himself and then eat the bread and drink from the cup,
461Co 11:29 because whoever eats and drinks without recognizing the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself.
461Co 11:30 That's why so many of you are weak and sick and a considerable number are dying.
461Co 11:31 But if we judged ourselves correctly, we would not be judged.
461Co 11:32 Now, while we are being judged by the Lord, we are being disciplined so we won't be condemned along with the world.
461Co 11:33 Therefore, my brothers, when you gather to eat, wait for each other.
461Co 11:34 If anyone is hungry, he should eat at home, so that when you gather it may not bring judgment on you. And when I come I will give instructions concerning the other matters.11
461Co 12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I don't want you to be ignorant.
461Co 12:2 You know that when you were unbelievers, you were enticed and led astray to worship idols that couldn't even speak.
461Co 12:3 For this reason I want you to be aware that no one who is speaking by God's Spirit can say, "Jesus is cursed," and no one can say, "Jesus is Lord," except by the Holy Spirit. 
461Co 12:4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit,
461Co 12:5 and there are varieties of ministries, but the same Lord.
461Co 12:6 There are varieties of results, but it is the same God who produces all the results in everyone.
461Co 12:7 To each person has been given the ability to manifest the Spirit for the common good.
461Co 12:8 To one has been given a message of wisdom by the Spirit; to another the ability to speak with knowledge according to the same Spirit;
461Co 12:9 to another faith by the same Spirit; to another gifts of healing by that one Spirit;
461Co 12:10 to another miraculous results; to another prophecy; to another the ability to distinguish between spirits; to another various kinds of languages; and to another the interpretation of languages.
461Co 12:11 But one and the same Spirit produces all these results and gives what he wants to each person. 
461Co 12:12 For just as the body is one and yet has many parts, and all the parts of the body, though many, form a single body, so it is with the Messiah.
461Co 12:13 For by one Spirit all of us - Jews and Greeks, slaves and free - were baptized into one body and were all privileged to drink from one Spirit.12
461Co 12:14 For the body does not consist of only one part, but of many.
461Co 12:15 If the foot says, "Since I'm not a hand, I'm not part of the body," that does not make it any less a part of the body, does it - 
461Co 12:16 And if the ear says, "Since I'm not an eye, I'm not part of the body," that does not make it any less a part of the body, does it - 
461Co 12:17 If the whole body were an eye, where would the sense of hearing be? If the whole body were an ear, where would the sense of smell be - 
461Co 12:18 But now God has arranged the parts, every one of them, in the body according to his plan.
461Co 12:19 Now if all of it were one part, there wouldn't be a body, would there - 
461Co 12:20 So there are many parts, but one body.
461Co 12:21 The eye cannot say to the hand, "I don't need you," or the head to the feet, "I don't need you."
461Co 12:22 On the contrary, those parts of the body that seem to be weaker are in fact indispensable,
461Co 12:23 and the parts of the body that we think are less honorable are treated with special honor, and we make our less attractive parts more attractive.
461Co 12:24 However, our attractive parts don't need this. But God has put the body together and has given special honor to the parts that lack it,
461Co 12:25 so that there might be no disharmony in the body, but that its parts should have the same concern for each other.
461Co 12:26 If one part suffers, every part suffers with it. If one part is praised, every part rejoices with it.
461Co 12:27 Now you are the Messiah's body and individual parts of it.
461Co 12:28 God has appointed in the church first of all apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then those who perform miracles, those who have gifts of healing, those who help others, administrators, and those who speak various kinds of languages.
461Co 12:29 Not all are apostles, are they? Not all are prophets, are they? Not all are teachers, are they? Not all perform miracles, do they - 
461Co 12:30 Not all have the gift of healing, do they? Not all speak in other languages, do they? Not all interpret, do they - 
461Co 12:31 Keep on desiring the better gifts. And now I will show you the best way of all.1229
461Co 13:1 If I speak in the languages of humans and angels but have no love, I have become a reverberating gong or a clashing cymbal.
461Co 13:2 If I have the gift of prophecy and can understand all secrets and every form of knowledge, and if I have absolute faith so as to move mountains but have no love, I am nothing.
461Co 13:3 Even if I give away everything that I have and sacrifice myself, but have no love, I gain nothing.
461Co 13:4 Love is always patient; love is always kind; love is never envious or arrogant with pride. Nor is she conceited,
461Co 13:5 and she is never rude; she never thinks just of herself or ever gets annoyed. She never is resentful;
461Co 13:6 is never glad with sin; she's always glad to side with truth, and pleased that truth shall win.
461Co 13:7 She bears up under everything, believes the best in all, there is no limit to her hope, and she will never fall.
461Co 13:8 Love never fails. Now if there are prophecies, they will be done away with. If there are languages, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will be done away with.
461Co 13:9 For what we know is incomplete and what we prophesy is incomplete.
461Co 13:10 But when what is complete comes, then what is incomplete will be done away with.
461Co 13:11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, thought like a child, and reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up my childish ways.
461Co 13:12 Now we see only an indistinct image in a mirror, but then we will be face to face. Now what I know is incomplete, but then I will know fully, even as I have been fully known. 
461Co 13:13 Right now three things remain£º faith, hope, and love. But the greatest of these is love.
461Co 14:1 Keep on pursuing love, and keep on desiring spiritual gifts, especially the ability to prophesy.
461Co 14:2 For the person who speaks in another language is not actually speaking to people but to God. Indeed, no one understands him, because he is talking about secrets by the Spirit.
461Co 14:3 But the person who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding, encouragement, and comfort.
461Co 14:4 The person who speaks in another language builds himself up, but the person who prophesies builds up the church.
461Co 14:5 Now I wish that all of you could speak in other languages, but especially that you could prophesy. The person who prophesies is more important than the person who speaks in another language, unless he interprets it so that the church may be built up.
461Co 14:6 Indeed, brothers, if I come to you speaking in other languages, what good will I be to you unless I speak to you in some revelation, knowledge, prophecy, or teaching - 
461Co 14:7 In the same way, lifeless instruments like the flute or harp produce sounds. But if there's no difference in the notes, how can a person tell what tune is being played - 
461Co 14:8 For example, if a bugle doesn't sound a clear call, who will get ready for battle - 
461Co 14:9 In the same way, unless you speak an intelligible message with your language, how will anyone know what is being said? You'll be talking into the air!
461Co 14:10 There are, I suppose, many different languages in the world, yet none of them is without meaning.
461Co 14:11 If I don't know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker will be a foreigner to me.
461Co 14:12 In the same way, since you're so desirous of spiritual gifts, you must keep on desiring them for the upbuilding of the church.
461Co 14:13 Therefore, the person who speaks in another language should pray for the ability to interpret it.
461Co 14:14 For if I pray in another language, my spirit prays but my mind is not productive.
461Co 14:15 What does this mean? I will pray with my spirit, but I will also pray with my mind. I will sing psalms with my spirit, but I will also sing psalms with my mind.
461Co 14:16 Otherwise, if you say a blessing with your spirit, how can an otherwise uneducated person say "Amen" to your thanksgiving, since he does not know what you're saying - 
461Co 14:17 It's good for you to give thanks, but it does not build up the other person.
461Co 14:18 I thank God that I speak in other languages more than all of you.
461Co 14:19 But in church I would rather speak five words with my mind to instruct others than 10,000 words in another language.
461Co 14:20 Brothers, stop being childish in your thinking. Be like infants with respect to evil, but think like adults.
461Co 14:21 In the law it is written, "By means of other languages and through the mouths of foreigners I will speak to this people, but even then they will not listen to me," declares the Lord.
461Co 14:22 Other languages, then, are meant to be a sign, not for believers, but for unbelievers, while prophecy is meant, not for unbelievers, but for believers.
461Co 14:23 Now if the whole church gathers in the same place and everyone is speaking in other languages, when uneducated people or unbelievers come in, they will say that you are out of your mind, won't they - 
461Co 14:24 But if everyone is prophesying, when an unbeliever or an uneducated person comes in he will be convicted and examined by everything that's happening.
461Co 14:25 His secret, inner heart will become known, and so he will bow down to the ground and worship God, declaring, "God is truly among you!"22
461Co 14:26 What, then, does this mean, brothers? When you gather, everyone has a psalm, teaching, revelation, other language, or interpretation. Everything must be done for upbuilding.
461Co 14:27 If anyone speaks in another language, only two or three at the most should do so, one at a time, and somebody must interpret.
461Co 14:28 If an interpreter is not present, the speaker should remain silent in the church and speak to himself and God.
461Co 14:29 Two or three prophets should speak, and others should weigh carefully what is said.
461Co 14:30 If a revelation is made to another person who is seated, the first person should be silent.
461Co 14:31 For everyone can prophesy in turn, so that everyone can be instructed and everyone can be encouraged.
461Co 14:32 The spirits of prophets are subject to the prophets,
461Co 14:33 for God is not a God of disorder but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,
461Co 14:34 the women must keep silent in the churches. They are not allowed to speak out, but must place themselves in submission, as the oral law also says.
461Co 14:35 If they want to learn anything, they should ask their own husbands at home, for it is inappropriate for a woman to speak out in church.14
461Co 14:36 Did God's word originate with you? Are you the only people it has reached - 
461Co 14:37 If anyone thinks he is a prophet or a spiritual person, he must acknowledge that what I am writing to you is the Lord's command.
461Co 14:38 But if anyone ignores this, he should be ignored.
461Co 14:39 Therefore, my brothers, desire the ability to prophesy, and do not prevent others from speaking in other languages.
461Co 14:40 But everything must be done in a proper and orderly way. 
461Co 15:1 Now I'm making known to you, brothers, the gospel that I proclaimed to you, which you accepted, on which you have taken your stand,
461Co 15:2 and by which you are also being saved if you hold firmly to the message I proclaimed to you - unless, of course, your faith was worthless. 
461Co 15:3 For I passed on to you the most important points that I received£º The Messiah died for our sins according to the Scriptures,
461Co 15:4 he was buried, he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures - and is still alive! - 
461Co 15:5 and he was seen by Cephas, and then by the twelve disciples.
461Co 15:6 After that, he was seen by more than 500 brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have died.
461Co 15:7 Next he was seen by James, then by all the apostles,
461Co 15:8 and finally he was seen by me, as though I were born abnormally late. 
461Co 15:9 For I am the least of the apostles and not even fit to be called an apostle because I persecuted God's church.
461Co 15:10 But by God's grace I am what I am, and his grace shown to me was not wasted. Instead, I worked harder than all the others - not I, of course, but God's grace that was with me.
461Co 15:11 So, whether it was I or the others, this is what we preach, and this is what you believed.9
461Co 15:12 Now if we preach that the Messiah has been raised from the dead, how can some of you keep claiming there is no resurrection of the dead - 
461Co 15:13 If there is no resurrection of the dead, then the Messiah has not been raised,
461Co 15:14 and if the Messiah has not been raised, then our message means nothing and your faith means nothing.
461Co 15:15 In addition, we are found to be false witnesses about God because we testified on God's behalf that he raised the Messiah - whom he did not raise if in fact it is true that the dead are not raised.
461Co 15:16 For if the dead are not raised, then the Messiah has not been raised,
461Co 15:17 and if the Messiah has not been raised, your faith is worthless and you are still imprisoned by your sins.
461Co 15:18 Yes, even those who have died believing in the Messiah are lost.
461Co 15:19 If we have set our hopes on the Messiah in this life only, we deserve more pity than any other people.12
461Co 15:20 But at this moment the Messiah stands risen from the dead, the first one offered in the harvest of those who have died.
461Co 15:21 For since death came through a man, the resurrection of the dead also came through a man.
461Co 15:22 For as in Adam all die, so also in the Messiah will all be made alive.
461Co 15:23 However, this will happen to each person in the proper order£º first the Messiah, then those who belong to the Messiah when he comes.
461Co 15:24 Then the end will come, when after he has done away with every ruler and every authority and power, the Messiah hands over the kingdom to God the Father.
461Co 15:25 For he must rule until God puts all the Messiah's enemies under his feet.
461Co 15:26 The last enemy to be done away with is death,
461Co 15:27 for "God has put everything under his feet." Now when he says, "Everything has been put under him," this clearly excludes the one who put everything under him.
461Co 15:28 But when everything has been put under him, then the Son himself will also become subject to the one who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all.
461Co 15:29 Otherwise, what will those people do who are being baptized because of those who have died? If the dead are not raised at all, why are they being baptized because of them - 
461Co 15:30 And why in fact are we being endangered every hour - 
461Co 15:31 I face death every day! That is as certain, brothers, as it is that I am proud of you in the Messiah, Jesus our Lord.
461Co 15:32 If I have fought with wild animals in Ephesus from merely human motives, what do I get out of it? If the dead are not raised, "Let's eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
461Co 15:33 Stop being deceived£º "Wicked friends lead to evil ends."
461Co 15:34 Come back to your senses as you should, and stop sinning! For some of you - I say this to your shame - don't fully know God. 
461Co 15:35 But someone will ask, "How are the dead raised? What kind of body will they have when they come back?"
461Co 15:36 You fool! The seed you plant does not come to life unless it dies,
461Co 15:37 and what you plant is not the form that it will be, but a bare kernel, whether it is wheat or something else.
461Co 15:38 But God gives the plant the form he wants it to have, and to each kind of seed its own form.
461Co 15:39 Not all flesh is the same. Humans have one kind of flesh, animals in general have another, birds have another, and fish have still another.
461Co 15:40 There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the splendor of those in heaven is of one kind, and that of those on earth is of another.
461Co 15:41 One kind of splendor belongs to the sun, another to the moon, and still another to the stars. In fact, one star differs from another star in splendor.
461Co 15:42 This is how it will be at the resurrection of the dead. What is planted is decaying, what is raised cannot decay.
461Co 15:43 The body is planted in a state of dishonor but is raised in a state of splendor. It is planted in weakness but is raised in power.
461Co 15:44 It is planted a physical body but is raised a spiritual body. If there is a physical body, there is also a spiritual body.
461Co 15:45 This, indeed, is what is written£º "The first man, Adam, became a living being." The last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
461Co 15:46 The spiritual does not come first, but the physical does, and then comes the spiritual.
461Co 15:47 The first man came from the dust of the earth; the second man came from heaven.
461Co 15:48 Those who are made of the dust are like the man from the dust; those who are heavenly are like the man who is from heaven.
461Co 15:49 Just as we have borne the likeness of the man who was made from dust, we will also bear the likeness of the man from heaven.
461Co 15:50 Brothers, this is what I mean£º Mortal bodies cannot inherit the kingdom of God, and what decays cannot inherit what does not decay.
461Co 15:51 Let me tell you a secret. Not all of us will die, but all of us will be changed - 
461Co 15:52 in a moment, faster than an eye can blink, at the sound of the last trumpet. Indeed, that trumpet will sound, and then the dead will be raised never to decay, and we will be changed.
461Co 15:53 For what is decaying must be clothed with what cannot decay, and what is dying must be clothed with what cannot die.
461Co 15:54 Now, when what is decaying is clothed with what cannot decay, and what is dying is clothed with what cannot die, then the written word will be fulfilled£º "Death has been swallowed up by victory!"
461Co 15:55 "Where, O death, is your victory? Where, O death, is your sting?"
461Co 15:56 Now death's stinger is sin, and sin's power is the law.
461Co 15:57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus the Messiah! 
461Co 15:58 Therefore, my dear brothers, be steadfast, unmovable, always excelling in the work of the Lord, because you know that the work that you do for the Lord isn't wasted.
461Co 16:1 Now concerning the collection for the saints, you should follow the directions I gave to the churches in Galatia.
461Co 16:2 After the Sabbath ends, each of you should set aside and save something from your surplus in proportion to what you have, so that no collections will have to be made when I arrive.
461Co 16:3 When I arrive, I will send letters along with the men you approve to take your gift to Jerusalem.
461Co 16:4 If it is worthwhile for me to go, too, they can go with me
461Co 16:5 I will visit you when I go through Macedonia - for I intend to go through Macedonia - 
461Co 16:6 and will probably stay with you for a while or even spend the winter with you. Then you can send me on my way, wherever I decide to go.
461Co 16:7 I do not want to visit with you now just in passing, because I hope to spend a longer time with you if the Lord permits.
461Co 16:8 However, I'll stay on in Ephesus until Pentecost,
461Co 16:9 because a door has opened wide for me to do effective work, although many people are opposing me.7
461Co 16:10 If Timothy comes, see to it that he does not have anything to be afraid of while he is with you, for he is doing the Lord's work as I am.
461Co 16:11 Therefore, no one should treat him with contempt. Send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me, because I am expecting him along with the brothers. 
461Co 16:12 Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but he was not inclined to do so just now. However, he will visit you when the time is right. 
461Co 16:13 Remain alert. Keep standing firm in your faith. Keep on being courageous and strong.
461Co 16:14 Everything you do should be done lovingly.
461Co 16:15 Now I urge you, brothers - for you know that the members of the family of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to serving the saints - 
461Co 16:16 to submit yourselves to people like these and to anyone else who shares their labor and hard work.
461Co 16:17 I am glad that Stephanas, Fortunatus, and Achaicus came here, because what was lacking they have supplied through you.
461Co 16:18 They refreshed my spirit - and yours, too. Therefore, appreciate men like that. 
461Co 16:19 The churches in Asia greet you. Aquila and Prisca and the church in their house greet you warmly in union with the Lord.
461Co 16:20 All the brothers greet you. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
461Co 16:21 I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand. 
461Co 16:22 If anyone doesn't love the Lord, let him be condemned! May our Lord come!
461Co 16:23 May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with you!
461Co 16:24 May my love remain with all of you in union with the Messiah Jesus.

472Co 1:1 From£º Paul, an apostle of the Messiah Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother. To£º God's church in Corinth, and to all the holy people throughout Achaia.
472Co 1:2 May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be yours! 
472Co 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah! He is our merciful Father and the God of all comfort,
472Co 1:4 who comforts us in all our suffering, so that we may be able to comfort others in all their suffering, as we ourselves are being comforted by God.
472Co 1:5 For as the Messiah's sufferings overflow into us, so also our comfort overflows through the Messiah.
472Co 1:6 If we suffer, it is for your comfort and salvation. If we are comforted, it is for your comfort when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we are suffering.
472Co 1:7 Our hope for you is unshaken, because we know that as you share our sufferings, you also share our comfort. 
472Co 1:8 For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about the suffering we experienced in Asia. We were so crushed beyond our ability to endure that we even despaired of living.
472Co 1:9 In fact, we felt that we had received a death sentence so we would not rely on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead.
472Co 1:10 He has rescued us from a terrible death, and he will continue to rescue us. Yes, he is the one on whom we have set our hope, and he will rescue us again,
472Co 1:11 as you also help us by your prayers for us. Then many people will thank God on our behalf because of the favor shown us through the prayers of many. 
472Co 1:12 For this is what we boast about£º Our conscience testifies that we have conducted ourselves in the world with pure motives and godly sincerity, without earthly wisdom but with God's grace - especially toward you.
472Co 1:13 For what we are writing you is nothing more than what you can read and also understand. I hope you will understand completely,
472Co 1:14 just as you have already understood us partially, so that on the Day of our Lord Jesus we can be your reason to boast, even as you are ours.1
472Co 1:15 Because I was confident, I planned to come to you first so you might receive a double blessing.
472Co 1:16 I planned to leave you in order to go to Macedonia, and then come back to you from Macedonia, and let you send me on to Judea.1
472Co 1:17 When I planned this, I did not do it lightly, did I? Are my plans so fickle that I can say "Yes" and "No" at the same time - 
472Co 1:18 As certainly as God is faithful, we haven't talked to you with mixed messages like that.
472Co 1:19 For God's Son, Jesus the Messiah, who was preached among you by us - by me, Silvanus, and Timothy - was not "Yes" and "No." But with him it is always "Yes."
472Co 1:20 For all God's promises are "Yes" in him. And so through him we can say "Amen," to the glory of God.
472Co 1:21 Now the one who makes us - and you as well - secure in union with the Messiah and has anointed us is God,
472Co 1:22 who has placed his seal on us and has given us the Spirit in our hearts as a down payment. 
472Co 1:23 I call upon God as a witness on my behalf that it was in order to spare you that I did not return to Corinth.
472Co 1:24 It is not that we are trying to rule over your faith, but rather to work with you for your joy, because you have been standing firm in the faith. 
472Co 2:1 Now I decided not to pay you another painful visit.
472Co 2:2 After all, if I were to grieve you, who should make me happy but the person I am making sad - 
472Co 2:3 This is the very reason I wrote you, so that when I did come I might not be made sad by those who should have made me happy. For I had confidence that all of you would share the joy that I have.
472Co 2:4 I wrote to you out of great sorrow and anguish of heart - along with many tears - not to make you sad but to let you know how much love I have for you.2
472Co 2:5 But if anyone has caused grief, he didn't cause me any grief. To some extent - I don't want to emphasize this too much - it has affected all of you.
472Co 2:6 This punishment by the majority is severe enough for such a man.
472Co 2:7 So forgive and comfort him, or else he will drown in his excessive grief.
472Co 2:8 That's why I'm urging you to assure him of your love.
472Co 2:9 I had also written to you to see if you would stand the test and be obedient in every way.
472Co 2:10 When you forgive someone, I do, too. Indeed, what I have forgiven - if there was anything to forgive - I did in the presence of the Messiah for your benefit,
472Co 2:11 so that we may not be outsmarted by Satan. After all, we are not unaware of his intentions.
472Co 2:12 When I went to Troas on behalf of the gospel of the Messiah, the Lord opened a door for me,
472Co 2:13 but my spirit could not find any relief, because I couldn't find Titus, my brother. So I said goodbye to them and went on to Macedonia.2
472Co 2:14 But thanks be to God! He always leads us triumphantly by the Messiah and through us spreads everywhere the fragrance of knowing him.
472Co 2:15 To God we are the aroma of the Messiah among those who are being saved and among those who are being lost.
472Co 2:16 To some people we are a deadly fragrance, while to others we are a living fragrance. Who is qualified for this - 
472Co 2:17 At least we are not commercializing God's word like so many others. Instead, we speak with sincerity in the Messiah's name, like people who are sent from God and are accountable to God.
472Co 3:1 Are we beginning to recommend ourselves again? Unlike some people, we do not need letters of recommendation to you or from you, do we - 
472Co 3:2 You are our letter, written in our hearts and known and read by everyone.
472Co 3:3 You are demonstrating that you are the Messiah's letter, produced by our service, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.3
472Co 3:4 Such is the confidence that we have in God through the Messiah.
472Co 3:5 By ourselves we are not qualified to claim that anything comes from us. Rather, our credentials come from God,
472Co 3:6 who has also qualified us to be ministers of a new covenant, which is not written but spiritual, because the written text brings death, but the Spirit gives life. 
472Co 3:7 Now if the ministry of death that was inscribed in letters of stone came with such glory that the people of Israel could not gaze on Moses' face (because the glory was fading away from it),
472Co 3:8 will not the Spirit's ministry have even more glory - 
472Co 3:9 For if the ministry of condemnation has glory, then the ministry of justification has an overwhelming glory.
472Co 3:10 In fact, that which once had glory lost its glory, because the other glory surpassed it.
472Co 3:11 For if that which fades away came through glory, how much more does that which is permanent have glory - 
472Co 3:12 Therefore, since we have such a hope, we speak very boldly,
472Co 3:13 not like Moses, who kept covering his face with a veil to keep the people of Israel from gazing at the end of what was fading away.
472Co 3:14 However, their minds were hardened, for to this day the same veil is still there when they read the old covenant. Only in union with the Messiah is that veil removed.
472Co 3:15 Yet even to this day, when Moses is read, a veil covers their hearts.
472Co 3:16 But whenever a person turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
472Co 3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Lord's Spirit is, there is freedom.
472Co 3:18 As all of us reflect the glory of the Lord with unveiled faces, we are becoming more like him with ever-increasing glory by the Lord's Spirit.314
472Co 4:1 Therefore, since we have this ministry through the mercy shown to us, we do not get discouraged.
472Co 4:2 Instead, we have renounced secret and shameful ways. We do not use trickery or pervert God's word. By clear statements of the truth we commend ourselves to everyone's conscience before God. 
472Co 4:3 So if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled to those who are dying.
472Co 4:4 In their case, the god of this world has blinded the minds of those who do not believe to keep them from seeing the light of the glorious gospel of the Messiah, who is the image of God.4
472Co 4:5 For we do not preach ourselves, but rather Jesus the Messiah as Lord, and ourselves as merely your servants for Jesus' sake.
472Co 4:6 For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in our hearts to give us the light of the knowledge of God's glory in the face of Jesus the Messiah.
472Co 4:7 But we have this treasure in clay jars to show that its extraordinary power comes from God and not from us.
472Co 4:8 In every way we're troubled but not crushed, frustrated but not in despair,
472Co 4:9 persecuted but not abandoned, struck down but not destroyed.
472Co 4:10 We are always carrying around the death of Jesus in our bodies, so that the life of Jesus may be clearly shown in our bodies.
472Co 4:11 While we are alive, we are constantly being handed over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus may be clearly shown in our mortal bodies.
472Co 4:12 And so death is at work in us, but life is at work in you. 
472Co 4:13 Now since we have the same spirit of faith in keeping with this Scripture£º "I believed, and so I spoke," we also believe and therefore speak.
472Co 4:14 We know that the one who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and present us to God together with you.
472Co 4:15 All this is for your sake so that, as his grace spreads, more and more people will give thanks and glorify God. 
472Co 4:16 That's why we are not discouraged. No, even if outwardly we are wearing out, inwardly we are being renewed each and every day.
472Co 4:17 This light, temporary nature of our suffering is producing for us an everlasting weight of glory, far beyond any comparison,
472Co 4:18 because we do not look for things that can be seen but for things that cannot be seen. For things that can be seen are temporary, but things that cannot be seen are eternal. 
472Co 5:1 We know that if the earthly tent we live in is torn down, we have a building in heaven that comes from God, an eternal house not built by human hands.
472Co 5:2 For in this one we sigh, since we long to put on our heavenly dwelling.
472Co 5:3 Of course, if we do put it on, we will not be found without a body.
472Co 5:4 So while we are still in this tent, we sigh under our burdens, because we do not want to put it off but to put it on, so that our dying bodies may be swallowed up by life.
472Co 5:5 God has prepared us for this and has given us his Spirit as a guarantee.2
472Co 5:6 Therefore, we are always confident, and we know that as long as we are at home in this body we are away from the Lord.
472Co 5:7 For we live by faith, not by sight.
472Co 5:8 We are confident, then, and would prefer to be away from this body and to live with the Lord.
472Co 5:9 So whether we are at home or away from home, our goal is to be pleasing to him.
472Co 5:10 For all of us must appear before the judgment seat of the Messiah, so that each of us may receive what he deserves for what he has done in his body, whether good or worthless.
472Co 5:11 Therefore, since we know what it means to fear the Lord, we try to persuade people. We ourselves are perfectly known to God. I hope we are also really known to your consciences.
472Co 5:12 We are not recommending ourselves to you again but are giving you a reason to be proud of us, so that you can answer those who are proud of outward things rather than inward character.
472Co 5:13 So if we were crazy, it was for God; if we are sane, it is for you.
472Co 5:14 The love of the Messiah controls us, for we are convinced of this£º that one person died for all people; therefore, all people have died.
472Co 5:15 He died for all people, so that those who live should no longer live for themselves but for the one who died and rose for them. 
472Co 5:16 So then, from now on we do not think of anyone from a human point of view. Even if we did think of the Messiah from a human point of view, we don't think of him that way any more. 
472Co 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in the Messiah, he is a new creation. Old things have disappeared, and - look! - all things have become new! 
472Co 5:18 All of this comes from God, who has reconciled us to himself through the Messiah and has given us the ministry of reconciliation,
472Co 5:19 for through the Messiah, God was reconciling the world to himself by not counting their sins against them. He has committed his message of reconciliation to us.
472Co 5:20 Therefore, we are the Messiah's representatives, as though God were pleading through us. We plead on the Messiah's behalf£º "Be reconciled to God!"
472Co 5:21 God made the one who did not know sin to be sin for us, so that God's righteousness would be produced in us.
472Co 6:1 Since, then, we are working with God, we plead with you not to accept God's grace in vain.
472Co 6:2 For he says, "At the right time I heard you, and on a day of salvation I helped you." Listen, now is really the "right time"! Now is the "day of salvation"!
472Co 6:3 We do not put an obstacle in anyone's way. Otherwise, fault may be found with our ministry.
472Co 6:4 Instead, in every way we demonstrate that we are God's servants by tremendous endurance in the midst of difficulties, hardships, and calamities;
472Co 6:5 in beatings, imprisonments, and riots; in hard work, sleepless nights, and hunger;
472Co 6:6 with purity, knowledge, patience, and kindness; with the Holy Spirit, genuine love,
472Co 6:7 truthful speech, and divine power; through the weapons of righteousness in the right and left hands;
472Co 6:8 through honor and dishonor; through ill repute and good repute; perceived as deceivers and yet true,
472Co 6:9 as unknown and yet well-known, as dying and yet - as you see - very much alive, as punished and yet not killed,
472Co 6:10 as sorrowful and yet always rejoicing, as poor and yet enriching many, as having nothing and yet possessing everything.
472Co 6:11 We have spoken frankly to you, Corinthians. Our hearts are wide open.
472Co 6:12 We have not cut you off, but you have cut off your own feelings toward us.
472Co 6:13 Do us a favor - I ask you as my children - and open wide your hearts.12 
472Co 6:14 Stop becoming unevenly yoked with unbelievers. What partnership can righteousness have with lawlessness? What fellowship can light have with darkness - 
472Co 6:15 What harmony exists between the Messiah and Beliar, or what do a believer and an unbeliever have in common - 
472Co 6:16 What agreement can a temple of God make with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, just as God said£º "I will live and walk among them. I will be their God, and they will be my people."
472Co 6:17 Therefore, "Get away from them and separate yourselves from them," declares the Lord, "and don't touch anything unclean. Then I will welcome you.
472Co 6:18 I will be your Father, and you will be my sons and daughters," declares the Lord Almighty.
472Co 7:1 Since we have these promises, dear friends, let's cleanse ourselves from everything that contaminates body and spirit by becoming mature in our holy fear of God. 
472Co 7:2 Make room for us in your hearts! We have not treated anyone unjustly, harmed anyone, or cheated anyone.
472Co 7:3 I am not saying this to condemn you. I told you before that you are in our hearts to die together and to live together.
472Co 7:4 I have great confidence in you. I am very proud of you. I am very much encouraged. I am overjoyed in all our troubles. 
472Co 7:5 For even when we came to Macedonia, our bodies had no rest. We suffered in a number of ways. Outwardly there were conflicts, inwardly there were fears.
472Co 7:6 Yet God, who comforts those who feel miserable, comforted us by the arrival of Titus,
472Co 7:7 and not only by his arrival but also by the comfort he had received from you. He told us about your longing for me, your sorrow, and your eagerness to take my side, and this made me even happier.75
472Co 7:8 If I made you sad with my letter, I do not regret it, although I did regret it then. I see that the letter caused you sorrow, though only for a while.
472Co 7:9 Now I am happy, not because you had such sorrow, but because your sorrow led you to repent. For you were sorry in a godly way, and so you were not hurt by us in any way.
472Co 7:10 For having sorrow in a godly way results in repentance that leads to salvation and leaves no regrets. But the sorrow of the world produces death. 
472Co 7:11 See what great earnestness godly sorrow has produced in you! How ready you are to clear yourselves, how indignant, how alarmed, how full of longing and enthusiasm, how eager to seek justice! In every way you have demonstrated that you are innocent in this matter.
472Co 7:12 So, even though I wrote to you, it wasn't because of the man who did the wrong or because of the man who was hurt. Instead, I wrote to you so that your devotion to us might be made perfectly clear to you before God. 
472Co 7:13 This is what comforted us. In addition to our own comfort, we were even more delighted at the joy of Titus, because his spirit had been set at rest by all of you.
472Co 7:14 For if I have been doing some boasting about you to him, I have never been ashamed of it. Moreover, since everything we told you was true, our boasting to Titus has also proved to be true.
472Co 7:15 His heart goes out to you even more as he remembers how obedient all of you were and how you welcomed him with fear and trembling.
472Co 7:16 I rejoice that I can have complete confidence in you.
472Co 8:1 We want you to know, brothers, about God's grace that was given to the churches of Macedonia.
472Co 8:2 In spite of their terrible ordeal of suffering, their abundant joy and deep poverty has led them to be abundantly generous.
472Co 8:3 I can testify that by their own free will they have given to the utmost of their ability, yes, even beyond their ability.
472Co 8:4 They begged us earnestly for the privilege of participating in this ministry to the saints.
472Co 8:5 We did not expect that! They gave themselves to the Lord first and then to us, since this was God's will.
472Co 8:6 So we urged Titus to finish this work of kindness among you in the same way that he had started it.
472Co 8:7 Indeed, the more your faith, speech, knowledge, enthusiasm, and love for us increase, the more we want you to be rich in this work of kindness.2
472Co 8:8 I am not commanding you but testing the genuineness of your love by the enthusiasm of others.
472Co 8:9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah. Although he was rich, for your sakes he became poor, so that you, through his poverty, might become rich. 
472Co 8:10 I am giving you my opinion on this matter because it will be helpful to you. Last year you were not only willing to do something, but had already started to do it.
472Co 8:11 Now finish what you began, so that your eagerness to do so may be matched by your eagerness to complete it.
472Co 8:12 For if the eagerness is there, the gift is acceptable according to what you have, not according to what you do not have. 
472Co 8:13 Not that others should have relief while you have hardship. Rather, it is a question of fairness.
472Co 8:14 At the present time, your surplus fills their need, so that their surplus may fill your need. In this way things are fair.
472Co 8:15 As it is written, "The person who had much did not have too much, and the person who had little did not have too little."
472Co 8:16 But thanks be to God, who placed in the heart of Titus the same dedication to you that I have.
472Co 8:17 He welcomed my request and eagerly went to visit you by his own free will.
472Co 8:18 With him we have sent the brother who is praised in all the churches for spreading the gospel.
472Co 8:19 More than that, he has also been selected by the churches to travel with us while we are administering this work of kindness for the glory of the Lord and as evidence of our eagerness to help.
472Co 8:20 We are trying to avoid any criticism of the way we are administering this great undertaking.
472Co 8:21 We intend to do what is right, not only in the sight of the Lord, but also in the sight of people.820
472Co 8:22 We have also sent with them our brother whom we have often tested in many ways and found to be dedicated. At present he is more dedicated than ever because he has so much confidence in you.
472Co 8:23 As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker on your behalf. Our brothers, emissaries from the churches, are bringing glory to the Messiah.
472Co 8:24 Therefore, demonstrate to the churches that you love them and show them publicly why we boast about you.
472Co 9:1 I do not need to write to you any further about the ministry to the saints.
472Co 9:2 For I know how willing you are, and I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year, and your enthusiasm has stimulated most of them.
472Co 9:3 Now I have sent the brothers so that our boasting about you in this matter may not prove to be an idle boast, and so that you may stand ready, just as I said.
472Co 9:4 Otherwise, if any Macedonians come with me and find out that you are not ready, we would be humiliated - to say nothing of you - in this undertaking.
472Co 9:5 Therefore, I thought it necessary to urge these brothers to visit you ahead of me, to make arrangements in advance for this gift you promised, and to have it ready as something given generously and not forced.
472Co 9:6 Remember this£º The person who sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and the person who sows generously will also reap generously.
472Co 9:7 Each of you must give what you have decided in your heart, not with regret or under compulsion, since God loves a cheerful giver.
472Co 9:8 Besides, God is able to make every blessing of yours overflow for you, so that in every situation you will always have all you need for any good work.
472Co 9:9 As it is written, "He scatters everywhere and gives to the poor; his righteousness lasts forever."9
472Co 9:10 Now he who supplies seed to the farmer and bread to eat will also supply you with seed and multiply it and enlarge the harvest that results from your righteousness.
472Co 9:11 In every way you will grow richer and become even more generous, and this will cause others to give thanks to God because of us
472Co 9:12 because this ministry you render is not only fully supplying the needs of the saints, it is also overflowing with more and more prayers of thanksgiving to God.
472Co 9:13 Because your service in giving proves your love, you will be glorifying God as you obey what your confession of the Messiah's gospel demands, since you are generous in sharing with them and with everyone else.
472Co 9:14 And so in their prayers for you they will long for you because of God's exceptional grace that was shown to you.
472Co 9:15 Thanks be to God for his indescribable gift!
472Co 10:1 Now I myself, Paul, plead with you with the gentleness and kindness of the Messiah - I who am humble when I am face to face with you but forceful toward you when I am away!
472Co 10:2 I beg you that when I come I will not need to be courageous by daring to oppose some people who think that we are living according to the flesh.
472Co 10:3 Of course, we are living in the world, but we do not wage war in a world-like way.
472Co 10:4 For the weapons of our warfare are not those of the world. Instead, they have the power of God to demolish fortresses. We tear down arguments
472Co 10:5 and every proud obstacle that is raised against the knowledge of God, taking every thought captive in order to obey the Messiah.
472Co 10:6 Once your obedience is complete, we will be ready to reprimand every type of disobedience.
472Co 10:7 Look at the plain facts! If anyone is confident that he belongs to the Messiah, he should remind himself of this£º Just as he belongs to the Messiah, so do we.
472Co 10:8 So if I boast a little too much about our authority, which the Lord gave us to build you up and not to tear you down, I will not be ashamed of it. 
472Co 10:9 I do not want you to think that I am trying to frighten you with my letters.
472Co 10:10 For someone is saying, "His letters are impressive and forceful, but his bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible."
472Co 10:11 Someone like this should take note of the following£º What we say by letter when we are absent is what we will do when present!
472Co 10:12 We would not dare put ourselves in the same class with, or compare ourselves to, those who recommend themselves. Whenever they measure themselves by their own standards or compare themselves among themselves, they show how foolish they are.
472Co 10:13 We will not boast about what cannot be evaluated. Instead, we will stay within the field that God assigned us, so as to reach even you.
472Co 10:14 For it is not as though we were overstepping our limits when we came to you. We were the first to reach you with the gospel of the Messiah.
472Co 10:15 We are not boasting about work done by others that cannot be evaluated. On the contrary, we cherish the hope that your faith may continue to grow and enlarge our sphere of action among you until it overflows.
472Co 10:16 Then we can preach the gospel in the regions far beyond you without boasting about things already accomplished by someone else.1012
472Co 10:17 "The person who boasts should boast in the Lord."
472Co 10:18 It is not the person who commends himself who is approved, but the person whom the Lord commends. 
472Co 11:1 I wish you would tolerate a little of my foolishness. Yes, please tolerate me!
472Co 11:2 I am jealous of you with God's own jealousy, because I promised you in marriage to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to the Messiah.
472Co 11:3 However, I am afraid that just as the serpent deceived Eve by its tricks, so your minds may somehow be lured away from sincere and pure devotion to the Messiah.
472Co 11:4 For if someone comes along and preaches another Jesus than the one we preached, or should you receive a different spirit from the one you received or a different gospel from the one you accepted, you are all too willing to listen.
472Co 11:5 I do not think I'm inferior in any way to those "super-apostles."
472Co 11:6 Even though I may be untrained as an orator, I am not so in the field of knowledge. We have made this clear to all of you in every possible way. 
472Co 11:7 Did I commit a sin when I humbled myself by proclaiming to you the gospel of God free of charge, so that you could be exalted - 
472Co 11:8 I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.
472Co 11:9 When I was with you and needed something, I did not bother any of you, because our brothers who came from Macedonia supplied everything I needed. I kept myself from being a burden to you in any way, and I will continue to do so.8
472Co 11:10 As surely as the truth of the Messiah is in me, my boasting will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.
472Co 11:11 Why? Because I do not love you? God knows that I do! 
472Co 11:12 But I will go on doing what I'm doing in order to deny an opportunity to those people who want an opportunity to be recognized as our equals in the work they are boasting about.
472Co 11:13 Such people are false apostles, dishonest workers who are masquerading as apostles of the Messiah.
472Co 11:14 And no wonder, since Satan himself masquerades as an angel of light.
472Co 11:15 So it is not surprising if his servants also masquerade as servants of righteousness. Their doom will match their deeds!13
472Co 11:16 I will say it again£º No one should think that I am a fool. But if you do, then treat me like a fool so that I can also boast a little.
472Co 11:17 When I talk as a confident boaster, I am not talking with the Lord's authority but like a fool.
472Co 11:18 Since many people boast in a fleshly way, I will do it, too.
472Co 11:19 You are wise, so you will gladly be tolerant of fools.
472Co 11:20 You tolerate anyone who makes you his slaves, devours what you have, takes what is yours, orders you around, or slaps your face! 
472Co 11:21 I am ashamed to admit it, but we have been too weak for that. Whatever anyone else dares to claim - I am talking like a fool - I can claim it, too.
472Co 11:22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they among Abraham's descendants? So am I.
472Co 11:23 Are they the Messiah's servants? I am insane to talk like this, but I am a far better one! I have been involved in far greater efforts, far more imprisonments, countless beatings, and have faced death more than once.
472Co 11:24 Five times I received from the Jews 40 lashes minus one.
472Co 11:25 Three times I was beaten with a stick, once I was pelted with stones, three times I was shipwrecked, and I drifted on the sea for a day and a night.
472Co 11:26 I have traveled extensively and have been endangered from rivers, robbers, my own people, and gentiles. I've also been in danger in the city, in the open country, at sea, from false brothers,
472Co 11:27 in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, through hunger, thirst, many periods of fasting, coldness, and nakedness.
472Co 11:28 Besides everything else, I have a daily burden because of my anxiety about all the churches.
472Co 11:29 Who is weak without me being weak, too? Who is caused to stumble without me becoming indignant - 1122
472Co 11:30 If I must boast, I will boast about the things that show how weak I am.
472Co 11:31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.
472Co 11:32 In Damascus, the governor under King Aretas put guards around the city of Damascus to catch me,
472Co 11:33 but I was let down in a basket through an opening in the wall and escaped from him.11
472Co 12:1 I must boast, although it does not do any good. Let's talk about visions and revelations from the Lord.
472Co 12:2 I know a man who belongs to the Messiah. Fourteen years ago - whether in his body or outside of his body, I do not know, but God knows - that man was snatched away to the third heaven.
472Co 12:3 I know that this man - whether in his body or outside of his body, I do not know, but God knows - 
472Co 12:4 was snatched away to Paradise and heard things that cannot be expressed in words, things that no human being has a right even to mention.
472Co 12:5 I will boast about this man, but as for myself I will boast only about my weaknesses.
472Co 12:6 However, if I did want to boast, I would not be a fool, because I would be telling the truth. But I am not going to do it in order to keep anyone from thinking more of me than what he sees and hears about me. 
472Co 12:7 To keep me from becoming conceited because of the exceptional nature of these revelations, a thorn was given to me and placed in my body. It was Satan's messenger to keep on tormenting me so that I would not become conceited.
472Co 12:8 I pleaded with the Lord three times to take it away from me,
472Co 12:9 but he has told me, "My grace is all you need, because my power is perfected in weakness." Therefore, I will most happily boast about my weaknesses, so that the Messiah's power may rest on me.
472Co 12:10 That is why I take such pleasure in weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and difficulties for the Messiah's sake, for when I am weak, then I am strong. 
472Co 12:11 I have become a fool. You forced me to be one. Really, I should have been commended by you, for I am not in any way inferior to your "super-apostles," even if I am nothing.
472Co 12:12 The signs of an apostle were performed among you with utmost patience - signs, wonders, and powerful actions.
472Co 12:13 How were you treated worse than the other churches, except that I did not bother you for help? Forgive me for this wrong!
472Co 12:14 Now I'm ready to visit you for a third time, and I will not bother you for help. I do not want your things, but rather you yourselves. Children should not have to support their parents, but parents their children.
472Co 12:15 I will be very glad to spend my money and myself for you. Do you love me less because I love you so much - 12
472Co 12:16 Granting that I have not been a burden to you, was I a clever schemer who trapped you by some trick - 
472Co 12:17 I did not take advantage of you through any of the men I sent you, did I - 
472Co 12:18 I encouraged Titus to visit you, and I sent along with him the brother you know so well. Titus didn't take advantage of you, did he? We conducted ourselves with the same spirit, didn't we? We took the very same steps, didn't we? 
472Co 12:19 Have you been thinking all along that we are trying to defend ourselves before you? We are speaking before God in the authority of the Messiah, and everything, dear friends, is meant to build you up.
472Co 12:20 I am afraid that I may come and somehow find you not as I want to find you, and that you may find me not as you want to find me. Perhaps there will be quarreling, jealousy, anger, selfishness, slander, gossip, arrogance, and disorderly conduct.
472Co 12:21 I am afraid that when I come my God may again humble me before you and that I may have to grieve over many who formerly lived in sin and have not repented of their impurity, sexual immorality, and promiscuity that they once practiced.1220
472Co 13:1 This will be the third time I am coming to you. "Every accusation must be verified by two or three witnesses."
472Co 13:2 I have already warned those who sinned previously and all the rest. Although I am absent now, I am warning them as I did on my second visit£º If I come back, I will not spare you,
472Co 13:3 since you want proof that the Messiah is speaking through me. He is not weak in dealing with you but is making his power felt among you.
472Co 13:4 Though he was crucified in weakness, he lives by God's power. We are weak with him, but by God's power we will live for you. 
472Co 13:5 Keep examining yourselves to see whether you are continuing in the faith. Test yourselves! You know, don't you, that Jesus the Messiah lives in you? Could it be that you are failing the test - 
472Co 13:6 I hope you will realize that we haven't failed our test.
472Co 13:7 We pray to God that you will not do anything wrong - not to show that we have not failed the test, but so that you may do what is right, even if we seem to have failed.
472Co 13:8 For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
472Co 13:9 We are glad when we are weak and you are strong. That is what we are praying for - your maturity.7
472Co 13:10 For this reason I am writing this while I am away from you£º When I come I do not want to be severe in using the authority the Lord gave me to build you up and not to tear you down. 
472Co 13:11 Finally, brothers, goodbye. Keep on growing to maturity. Keep listening to my appeals. Continue agreeing with each other and living in peace. Then the God of love and peace will be with you.
472Co 13:12 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
472Co 13:13 All the saints greet you. 
472Co 13:14 May the grace of the Lord Jesus the Messiah, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with all of you!
48
48Gl 1:1 From£º Paul - an apostle not sent from men or by a man, but by Jesus the Messiah, and God the Father, who raised him from the dead - 
48Gl 1:2 and all the brothers who are with me. To£º The churches in Galatia.
48Gl 1:3 May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be yours!
48Gl 1:4 He gave himself for our sins in order to rescue us from this present evil age according to the will of our God and Father.
48Gl 1:5 To him be the glory forever and ever! Amen.
48Gl 1:6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting the one who called you by the grace of the Messiah and, instead, are following a different gospel,
48Gl 1:7 not that another one really exists. To be sure, there are certain people who are troubling you and want to distort the gospel about the Messiah.
48Gl 1:8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should proclaim to you a gospel contrary to what we proclaimed to you, let that person be condemned!
48Gl 1:9 What we have told you in the past I am now telling you again£º If anyone proclaims to you a gospel contrary to what you received, let that person be condemned!
48Gl 1:10 Am I now trying to win the approval of people or of God? Or am I trying to please people? If I were still trying to please people, I would not be the Messiah's servant.
48Gl 1:11 For I want you to know, brothers, that the gospel that was proclaimed by me is not of human origin.
48Gl 1:12 For I did not receive it from a man, nor was I taught it, but it was revealed to me by Jesus the Messiah.
48Gl 1:13 For you have heard about my earlier life in Judaism - how I kept violently persecuting God's church and was trying to destroy it.
48Gl 1:14 I advanced in Judaism beyond many of my contemporaries, because I was far more zealous for the traditions of my ancestors.1
48Gl 1:15 But when God, who set me apart before I was born and who called me by his grace, was pleased
48Gl 1:16 to reveal his Son to me so that I might proclaim him among the gentiles, I did not confer with another human being at any time,
48Gl 1:17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to see those who were apostles before me. Instead, I went away to Arabia and then came back to Damascus.
48Gl 1:18 Then three years later I went up to Jerusalem to become acquainted with Cephas, and I stayed with him for fifteen days.
48Gl 1:19 But I did not see any other apostle except James, the Lord's brother.
48Gl 1:20 (Before God, what I'm writing to you is the truth.)
48Gl 1:21 Then I went to the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
48Gl 1:22 But the churches of the Messiah that are in Judea did not yet know me personally.
48Gl 1:23 The only thing they kept hearing was this£º "The man who used to persecute us is now proclaiming the faith he once tried to destroy!"
48Gl 1:24 So they kept glorifying God for what had happened to me.1
48Gl 2:1 Then fourteen years later I again went up to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me.
48Gl 2:2 I went in response to a revelation, and in a private meeting with the reputed leaders, I explained to them the gospel that I'm proclaiming to the gentiles. I did this because I was afraid that I was running or had run my life's race for nothing.
48Gl 2:3 But not even Titus, who was with me, was forced to be circumcised, even though he was a Greek.
48Gl 2:4 However, false brothers were secretly brought in. They slipped in to spy on the freedom we have in the Messiah Jesus so that they might enslave us.
48Gl 2:5 But we did not give in to them for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might always remain with you. 
48Gl 2:6 Now those who were reputed to be important added nothing to my message. (What sort of people they were makes no difference to me, since God pays no attention to outward appearances.)
48Gl 2:7 In fact, they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel for the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel for the circumcised.
48Gl 2:8 For the one who worked through Peter by making him an apostle to the circumcised also worked through me by sending me to the gentiles.
48Gl 2:9 So when James, Cephas, and John (who were reputed to be leaders) recognized the grace that had been given me, they gave Barnabas and me the right hand of fellowship, agreeing that we should go to the gentiles and they to the circumcised.
48Gl 2:10 The only thing they asked us to do was to remember the destitute, the very thing I was eager to do.7
48Gl 2:11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he was clearly wrong.
48Gl 2:12 Until some men arrived from James, he was in the habit of eating with the gentiles, but after those men came, he withdrew from the gentiles and would not associate with them any longer, because he was afraid of the circumcision party.
48Gl 2:13 The other Jews also joined him in this hypocritical behavior, to the extent that even Barnabas was caught up in their hypocrisy.
48Gl 2:14 But when I saw that they were not acting consistently with the truth of the gospel, I told Cephas in front of everyone, "Though you are a Jew, you have been living like a gentile and not like a Jew. So how can you insist that the gentiles must live like Jews?" 
48Gl 2:15 We ourselves are Jews by birth, and not gentile sinners,
48Gl 2:16 yet we know that a person is not justified by doing what the law requires, but rather by the faithfulness of Jesus the Messiah. We, too, have believed in the Messiah Jesus so that we might be justified by the faithfulness of the Messiah and not by doing what the law requires, for no human being will be justified by doing what the law requires.
48Gl 2:17 Now if we, while trying to be justified by the Messiah, have been found to be sinners, does that mean that the Messiah is serving the interests of sin? Of course not!
48Gl 2:18 For if I rebuild something that I tore down, I demonstrate that I am a wrongdoer.
48Gl 2:19 For through the law I died to the law so that I might live for God. I have been crucified with the Messiah.
48Gl 2:20 I no longer live, but the Messiah lives in me, and the life that I am now living in this body I live by the faithfulness of the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
48Gl 2:21 I do not misapply God's grace, for if righteousness comes about by doing what the law requires, then the Messiah died for nothing.220
48Gl 3:1 You foolish Galatians! Who put you under a spell? Was not Jesus the Messiah clearly portrayed before your very eyes as having been crucified - 
48Gl 3:2 I want to learn only one thing from you£º Did you receive the Spirit by doing the actions of the law or by believing what you heard - 
48Gl 3:3 Are you so foolish? Having started out with the Spirit, are you now ending up with the flesh - 
48Gl 3:4 Did you suffer so much for nothing? (If it really was for nothing!)
48Gl 3:5 Does God supply you with the Spirit and work miracles among you because you do the actions of the law or because you believe what you heard - 
48Gl 3:6 In the same way, Abraham "believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness."
48Gl 3:7 You see, then, that those who have faith are Abraham's real descendants.
48Gl 3:8 Because the Scripture saw ahead of time that God would justify the gentiles by faith, it announced the gospel to Abraham beforehand when it said, "Through you all nations will be blessed."
48Gl 3:9 Therefore, those who believe are blessed together with Abraham, the one who believed.7
48Gl 3:10 Certainly all who depend on the actions of the law are under a curse. For it is written, "A curse on everyone who does not obey everything that is written in the book of the law!"
48Gl 3:11 Now it is obvious that no one is justified in the sight of God by the law, because "The righteous will live by faith."
48Gl 3:12 But the law has nothing to do with faith. Instead, "The person who keeps the commandments will have life in them."
48Gl 3:13 The Messiah redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For it is written, "A curse on everyone who is hung on a tree!"
48Gl 3:14 This happened in order that the blessing promised to Abraham would come to the gentiles through the Messiah Jesus, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.10
48Gl 3:15 Brothers, let me use an example from everyday life. Once a person's will has been ratified, no one can cancel it or add conditions to it.
48Gl 3:16 Now the promises were spoken to Abraham and to his descendant. It doesn't say "descendants," referring to many, but "your descendant," referring to one person, who is the Messiah.
48Gl 3:17 This is what I mean£º The law that came43 0 years later did not cancel the covenant that God ratified previously. The promise was never nullified.
48Gl 3:18 For if the inheritance comes about through the law, it no longer comes about through the promise. But it was through a promise that God so graciously gave it to Abraham.
48Gl 3:19 Why, then, was the law added? Because of transgressions, until the descendant came about to whom the promise pertained. It was put into effect through angels by means of a mediator.
48Gl 3:20 Now a mediator involves more than one party, but God is one.
48Gl 3:21 So is the law in conflict with the promises of God? Of course not! For if a law had been given that could give us life, then certainly righteousness would come through the law.
48Gl 3:22 But the Scripture has captured everything by means of sin's net, so that what was promised by the faithfulness of the Messiah might be granted to those who believe.
48Gl 3:23 Now before faith came about, we were held in custody and confined under the law in preparation for the faith that was to be revealed.
48Gl 3:24 And so the law was our guardian until the Messiah came, so that we might be justified by faith.
48Gl 3:25 But now that faith has come about, we are no longer under a guardian.
48Gl 3:26 For all of you are God's children through faith in the Messiah Jesus.
48Gl 3:27 Indeed, all of you who were baptized into the Messiah have clothed yourselves with the Messiah.
48Gl 3:28 Because all of you are one in the Messiah Jesus, a person is no longer a Jew or a Greek, a slave or a free person, a male or a female.
48Gl 3:29 And if you belong to the Messiah, then you are Abraham's descendants indeed, and heirs according to the promise.3
48Gl 4:1 Now what I am saying is this£º As long as an heir is a child, he is no better off than a slave, even though he owns everything.
48Gl 4:2 Instead, he is placed under the care of guardians and servant managers until the time set by the father.
48Gl 4:3 It was the same way with us. While we were children, we were slaves to the basic principles of the world.
48Gl 4:4 But when the appropriate time had come, God sent his Son, born by a woman, born under the law,
48Gl 4:5 in order to redeem those who were under the law, and thus to adopt them as his children.
48Gl 4:6 Now because you are his children, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts to cry out, "Abba! Father!"
48Gl 4:7 So you are no longer a slave but a child, and if you are a child, then you are also an heir because of what God did.
48Gl 4:8 However, in the past, when you did not know God, you were slaves to things that are not really gods at all.
48Gl 4:9 But now that you know God, or rather have been known by God, how can you turn back again to those powerless and bankrupt basic principles? Why do you want to become their slaves all over again - 
48Gl 4:10 You are observing days, months, seasons, and years.
48Gl 4:11 I am afraid for you! I don't want my work for you to have been wasted!
48Gl 4:12 I beg you, brothers, to become like me, since I became like you. You did not do anything wrong to me.
48Gl 4:13 You know that it was because I was ill that I brought you the gospel the first time.
48Gl 4:14 Even though my condition put you to the test, you did not despise or reject me. On the contrary, you welcomed me as if I were an angel of God, or as if I were the Messiah Jesus.
48Gl 4:15 What, then, happened to your positive attitude? For I testify that if it had been possible, you would have torn out your eyes and given them to me.
48Gl 4:16 So have I now become your enemy for telling you the truth - 
48Gl 4:17 These people who have been instructing you are devoted to you, but not in a good way. They want you to avoid me so that you will be devoted to them.
48Gl 4:18 (Now it is always good to be devoted to a good cause, even when I am not with you.)
48Gl 4:19 My children, I am suffering birth pains for you again until the Messiah is formed in you.
48Gl 4:20 Indeed, I wish I were with you right now so that I could change the tone of my voice, because I am completely baffled by you!
48Gl 4:21 Tell me, those of you who want to live under the law£º Are you really listening to what the law says - 
48Gl 4:22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and the other by a free woman.
48Gl 4:23 Now the slave woman's son was conceived through human means, while the free woman's son was conceived through divine promise.
48Gl 4:24 This is being said as an allegory, for these women represent two covenants. The one woman, Hagar, is from Mount Sinai, and her children are born into slavery.
48Gl 4:25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia and corresponds to present-day Jerusalem, because she is in slavery along with her children.
48Gl 4:26 But the heavenly Jerusalem is the free woman, and she is our spiritual mother.
48Gl 4:27 For it is written, "Rejoice, you childless woman, who cannot give birth to any children! Break into song and shout, you who feel no pains of childbirth! For the children of the deserted woman are more numerous than the children of the woman who has a husband."
48Gl 4:28 So you, brothers, are children of the promise, like Isaac.
48Gl 4:29 But just as then the son who was conceived according to the flesh persecuted the son who was conceived according to the Spirit, so it is now.
48Gl 4:30 But what does the Scripture say? "Drive out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman must never share the inheritance with the son of the free woman."
48Gl 4:31 So then, brothers, we are not children of the slave woman but of the free woman.429
48Gl 5:1 The Messiah has set us free so that we may enjoy the benefits of freedom. So keep on standing firm in it, and stop putting yourselves under the yoke of slavery again.
48Gl 5:2 Listen! I, Paul, am telling you that if you allow yourselves to be circumcised, the Messiah will be of no benefit to you.
48Gl 5:3 Again, I insist that everyone who allows himself to be circumcised is obligated to obey the entire law.
48Gl 5:4 Those of you who are trying to be justified by the law have been cut off from the Messiah. You have fallen away from grace.
48Gl 5:5 Through the Spirit by faith we confidently await the fulfillment of our righteous hope,
48Gl 5:6 for in union with the Messiah Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters. What matters is faith expressed through love.
48Gl 5:7 You were running the race beautifully. Who cut in on you and stopped you from obeying the truth - 
48Gl 5:8 Such influence does not come from the one who calls you.
48Gl 5:9 A little yeast spreads through the whole batch of dough.
48Gl 5:10 I am confident in the Lord that you will take no other view of this. However, the one who is troubling you will suffer God's judgment, whoever he is.
48Gl 5:11 As for me, brothers, if I am still preaching the necessity of circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed.
48Gl 5:12 I wish that those who are upsetting you would castrate themselves!11 
48Gl 5:13 For you, brothers, were called to freedom. Only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity to gratify your flesh, but through love make it your habit to serve one another.
48Gl 5:14 For the whole law is summarized in a single statement£º "You must love your neighbor as yourself."
48Gl 5:15 But if you bite and devour one another, be careful that you are not destroyed by each other.
48Gl 5:16 So I say, live by the Spirit, and you will never fulfill the desires of the flesh.
48Gl 5:17 For what the flesh wants is opposed to the Spirit, and what the Spirit wants is opposed to the flesh. They are opposed to each other, and so you do not do what you want to do.
48Gl 5:18 But if you are being led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.514
48Gl 5:19 Now the actions of the flesh are obvious£º sexual immorality, impurity, promiscuity,
48Gl 5:20 idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, rivalry, jealously, outbursts of anger, quarrels, conflicts, factions,
48Gl 5:21 envy, murder, drunkenness, wild partying, and things like that. I am telling you now, as I have told you in the past, that people who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
48Gl 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
48Gl 5:23 gentleness, and self-control. There is no law against such things.
48Gl 5:24 Now those who belong to the Messiah Jesus have crucified their flesh with its passions and desires.
48Gl 5:25 If we live by the Spirit, let's also be guided by the Spirit.
48Gl 5:26 Let's stop being arrogant, provoking one another and envying one another.525
48Gl 6:1 Brothers, if a person is caught doing something wrong, those of you who are spiritual should restore that person gently. Watch out for yourself so that you are not tempted as well.
48Gl 6:2 Practice carrying each other's burdens. In this way you will fulfill the law of the Messiah.
48Gl 6:3 For if anyone thinks he is something when he is really nothing, he is only fooling himself.
48Gl 6:4 Each person must examine his own actions, and then he can boast about his own accomplishments and not about someone else.
48Gl 6:5 For everyone must carry his own load. 
48Gl 6:6 The person who is taught the word should share all his goods with his teacher.
48Gl 6:7 Stop being deceived; God is not to be ridiculed. A person harvests whatever he plants£º
48Gl 6:8 The person who sows through human means will harvest decay from human means, but the person who sows in the Spirit will harvest eternal life from the Spirit.
48Gl 6:9 Let's not get tired of doing what is good, for at the right time we will reap a harvest - if we do not give up.
48Gl 6:10 So then, whenever we have the opportunity, let's practice doing good to everyone, especially to the family of faith. 
48Gl 6:11 Look at how large these letters are because I am writing with my own hand!
48Gl 6:12 These people who want to impress others by their external appearance are trying to force you to be circumcised, simply to avoid being persecuted for the cross of the Messiah.
48Gl 6:13 Why, not even those who are circumcised obey the law! They simply want you to be circumcised so that they can boast about your external appearance.
48Gl 6:14 But may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world!
48Gl 6:15 For neither circumcision nor uncircumcision matters. Rather, what matters is being a new creation.
48Gl 6:16 Now may peace be on all those who live by this principle, and may mercy be on the Israel of God.
48Gl 6:17 Let no one make any more trouble for me, because I carry the scars of Jesus on my own body.
48Gl 6:18 May the grace of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be with your spirit, brothers! Amen.

49Eph 1:1 From£º Paul, an apostle of the Messiah Jesus by God's will. To£º His holy and faithful people in Ephesus who are in union with the Messiah Jesus.
49Eph 1:2 May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be yours! 
49Eph 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah! He has blessed us in the Messiah with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realm,
49Eph 1:4 just as he chose us in the Messiah before the creation of the universe to be holy and blameless in his presence. In love
49Eph 1:5 he predestined us for adoption to himself through Jesus the Messiah, according to the pleasure of his will,
49Eph 1:6 so that we would praise his glorious grace that he gave us in the Beloved One.
49Eph 1:7 In union with him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our offenses, according to the riches of God's grace
49Eph 1:8 that he lavished on us, along with all wisdom and understanding,
49Eph 1:9 when he made known to us the secret of his will. This was according to his plan that he set forth in the Messiah
49Eph 1:10 to usher in the fullness of the times and to bring together in the Messiah all things in heaven and on earth.
49Eph 1:11 In the Messiah we were also chosen when we were predestined according to the purpose of the one who does everything that he wills to do,
49Eph 1:12 so that we who had already fixed our hope on the Messiah might live for his praise and glory.
49Eph 1:13 You, too, have heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation. When you believed in the Messiah, you were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
49Eph 1:14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until God redeems his own possession for his praise and glory. 
49Eph 1:15 Therefore, because I have heard about your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love for all the saints,
49Eph 1:16 I never stop giving thanks for you as I mention you in my prayers.
49Eph 1:17 I pray that the God of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, the most glorious Father, would give you a wise spirit, along with revelation that comes through knowing the Messiah fully.
49Eph 1:18 Then, with the eyes of your hearts enlightened, you will know the confidence that is produced by God having called you, the rich glory that is his inheritance among the saints,
49Eph 1:19 and the unlimited greatness of his power for us who believe, according to the working of his mighty strength,
49Eph 1:20 which he brought about in the Messiah when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly realm.
49Eph 1:21 He is far above every ruler, authority, power, dominion, and every name that can be named, not only in the present age but also in the one to come.
49Eph 1:22 God has put everything under the Messiah's feet and has made him the head of everything for the good of the church,
49Eph 1:23 which is his body, the fullness of the one who fills everything in every way.1
49Eph 2:1 You used to be dead because of your offenses and sins,
49Eph 2:2 that you once practiced as you lived according to the ways of this present world and according to the ruler of the power of the air, the spirit that is now active in those who are disobedient.
49Eph 2:3 Indeed, all of us once behaved like them in the lusts of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of our flesh and senses. By nature we were destined for wrath, just like everyone else.
49Eph 2:4 But God, who is rich in mercy, because of his great love for us
49Eph 2:5 even when we were dead because of our offenses, made us alive together with the Messiah (by grace you have been saved),
49Eph 2:6 raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly realm in the Messiah Jesus,
49Eph 2:7 so that in the coming ages he might display the limitless riches of his grace that comes to us through his kindness in the Messiah Jesus.
49Eph 2:8 For by such grace you have been saved through faith. This does not come from you; it is the gift of God
49Eph 2:9 and not the result of actions, to put a stop to all boasting.
49Eph 2:10 For we are God's masterpiece, created in the Messiah Jesus to perform good actions that God prepared long ago to be our way of life.
49Eph 2:11 So then, remember that at one time you gentiles by birth were called "the uncircumcised" by those who called themselves "the circumcised." They underwent physical circumcision done by human hands.
49Eph 2:12 At that time you were without the Messiah, excluded from citizenship in Israel, and strangers to the covenants of promise. You had no hope and were in the world without God.
49Eph 2:13 But now, in union with the Messiah Jesus, you who once were far away have been brought near by the blood of the Messiah. 
49Eph 2:14 For it is he who is our peace. Through his mortality he made both groups one by tearing down the wall of hostility that divided them.
49Eph 2:15 He rendered the law inoperative, along with its commandments and regulations, thus creating in himself one new humanity from the two, thereby making peace,
49Eph 2:16 and reconciling both groups to God in one body through the cross, on which he eliminated the hostility.
49Eph 2:17 He came and proclaimed peace for you who were far away and for you who were near.
49Eph 2:18 For through him, both of us have access to the Father by one Spirit.
49Eph 2:19 That is why you are no longer strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and members of God's household,
49Eph 2:20 having been built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, the Messiah Jesus himself being the cornerstone.
49Eph 2:21 In union with him the whole building is joined together and rises into a holy sanctuary for the Lord.
49Eph 2:22 You, too, are being built in him, along with the others, into a place for God's Spirit to dwell. 
49Eph 3:1 For this reason I, Paul, am the prisoner of the Messiah Jesus for the sake of you gentiles.
49Eph 3:2 Surely you have heard about the responsibility of administering God's grace that was given to me on your behalf,
49Eph 3:3 and how this secret was made known to me through a revelation, just as I wrote about briefly in the past.
49Eph 3:4 By reading this, you will be able to grasp my understanding of the secret about the Messiah,
49Eph 3:5 which in previous generations was not made known to human beings as it has now been revealed by the Spirit to God's holy apostles and prophets. This is that secret£º
49Eph 3:6 The gentiles are heirs-in-common, members-in-common of the body, and common participants in what was promised by the Messiah Jesus through the gospel.
49Eph 3:7 I have become a servant of this gospel according to the gift of God's grace that was given me by the working of his power.
49Eph 3:8 To me, the very least of all the saints, this grace was given so that I might proclaim to the gentiles the immeasurable wealth of the Messiah
49Eph 3:9 and help everyone see how this secret that has been at work was hidden for ages by God, who created all things.
49Eph 3:10 He did this so that now, through the church, the wisdom of God in all its variety might be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly realm
49Eph 3:11 in keeping with the eternal purpose that God carried out through the Messiah Jesus our Lord,
49Eph 3:12 in whom we have boldness and confident access through his faithfulness.
49Eph 3:13 So then, I ask you not to become discouraged because of my troubles on your behalf, which work toward your glory.39
49Eph 3:14 This is the reason I bow my knees before the Father of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah,
49Eph 3:15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth receives its name.
49Eph 3:16 I pray that he would give you, according to his glorious riches, strength in your inner being and power through his Spirit,
49Eph 3:17 and that the Messiah would make his home in your hearts through faith. Then, having been rooted and grounded in love,
49Eph 3:18 you will be able to understand, along with all the saints, what is wide, long, high, and deep - 
49Eph 3:19 that is, you will know the love of the Messiah, which transcends knowledge, and will be filled with all the fullness of God.3
49Eph 3:20 Now to the one who can do infinitely more than all we can ask or imagine according to the power that is working among us - 
49Eph 3:21 to him be glory in the church and in the Messiah Jesus to all generations, forever and ever! Amen. 
49Eph 4:1 I, therefore, the prisoner of the Lord, urge you to live in a way that is worthy of the calling to which you have been called,
49Eph 4:2 demonstrating all expressions of humility, gentleness, and patience, accepting one another in love.
49Eph 4:3 Do your best to maintain the unity of the Spirit by means of the bond of peace.
49Eph 4:4 There is one body and one Spirit. Likewise, you were called to the one hope of your calling.
49Eph 4:5 There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
49Eph 4:6 one God and Father of all, who is above all, through all, and in all. 
49Eph 4:7 Now to each one of us grace has been given proportionate to the measure of the Messiah's gift.
49Eph 4:8 That is why God says, "When he went up to the highest place he led captives into captivity and gave gifts to people."
49Eph 4:9 Now what does this "he went up" mean except that he also had gone down into the lower parts of the earth - 
49Eph 4:10 The one who went down is the same one who went up above all the heavens so that all things would be fulfilled.
49Eph 4:11 And it is he who gifted some to be apostles, others to be prophets, others to be evangelists, and still others to be pastors and teachers,
49Eph 4:12 to equip the saints, to do the work of ministry, and to build up the body of the Messiah
49Eph 4:13 until all of us are united in the faith and in the full knowledge of God's Son, and until we attain mature adulthood and the full standard of development in the Messiah.
49Eph 4:14 Then we will no longer be little children, tossed like waves and blown about by every wind of doctrine, by people's trickery, or by clever strategies that would lead us astray.
49Eph 4:15 Instead, by speaking the truth in love, we will grow up completely and become one with the head, that is, one with the Messiah,
49Eph 4:16 in whom the whole body is united and held together by every ligament with which it is supplied. As each individual part does its job, the body builds itself up in love.14
49Eph 4:17 Therefore, I tell you and insist on in the Lord not to live any longer like the gentiles live, thinking worthless thoughts.
49Eph 4:18 They are darkened in their understanding and separated from the life of God because of their ignorance and hardness of heart.
49Eph 4:19 Since they have lost all sense of shame, they have abandoned themselves to sensuality and practice every kind of sexual perversion without restraint.
49Eph 4:20 However, that is not the way you came to know the Messiah.
49Eph 4:21 Surely you have listened to him and have been taught by him, since truth is in Jesus.
49Eph 4:22 Regarding your former way of life, you were taught to strip off your old nature, which is being ruined by its deceptive desires,
49Eph 4:23 to be renewed in your mental attitude,
49Eph 4:24 and to clothe yourselves with the new nature, which was created according to God's image in righteousness and true holiness.
49Eph 4:25 Therefore, stripping off falsehood, "let each of us speak the truth to his neighbor," for we belong to one another.
49Eph 4:26 "Be angry, yet do not sin." Do not let the sun set while you are still angry,
49Eph 4:27 and do not give the devil an opportunity to work.
49Eph 4:28 The thief must no longer steal but must work hard and do what is good with his own hands, so that he might earn something to give to the needy.
49Eph 4:29 Let no filthy talk be heard from your mouths, but only what is good for building up people and meeting the need of the moment. This way you will administer grace to those who hear you.
49Eph 4:30 Do not grieve the Holy Spirit, by whom you were marked with a seal for the day of redemption.
49Eph 4:31 Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, quarreling, and slander be put away from you, along with all hatred.
49Eph 4:32 And be kind to one another, compassionate, forgiving one another just as God has forgiven you in the Messiah.429
49Eph 5:1 So be imitators of God, as his dear children.
49Eph 5:2 Live lovingly, just as the Messiah also loved us and gave himself for us as an offering and sacrifice, a fragrant aroma to God.
49Eph 5:3 Do not let sexual sin, impurity of any kind, or greed even be mentioned among you, as is proper for saints.
49Eph 5:4 Obscene, flippant, or vulgar talk is totally inappropriate. Instead, let there be thanksgiving.
49Eph 5:5 For you know very well that no immoral or impure person, or anyone who is greedy (that is, an idolater), has an inheritance in the kingdom of the Messiah and of God. 
49Eph 5:6 Do not let anyone deceive you with meaningless words, for it is because of these things that God becomes angry with those who disobey.
49Eph 5:7 So do not be partners with them.
49Eph 5:8 For once you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Live as children of light,
49Eph 5:9 for the fruit that the light produces consists of every form of goodness, righteousness, and truth.
49Eph 5:10 Determine what pleases the Lord,
49Eph 5:11 and have nothing to do with the unfruitful actions that darkness produces. Instead, expose them for what they are.
49Eph 5:12 For it is shameful even to mention what is done by these disobedient people in secret.
49Eph 5:13 But everything that is exposed to the light becomes visible,
49Eph 5:14 for the light is making everything visible. That is why it says, "Wake up, sleeper! Arise from the dead, and the Messiah will shine on you.''
49Eph 5:15 So, then, be careful how you live. Do not be unwise but wise,
49Eph 5:16 making the best use of your time because the times are evil.
49Eph 5:17 Therefore, do not be foolish, but understand what the Lord's will is.
49Eph 5:18 Stop getting drunk with wine, which leads to wild living, but keep on being filled with the Spirit.
49Eph 5:19 Then you will recite to one another psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; you will sing and make music to the Lord with your hearts;
49Eph 5:20 you will consistently give thanks to God the Father for everything in the name of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah;
49Eph 5:21 and you will submit to one another out of reverence for the Messiah.
49Eph 5:22 Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands as to the Lord.
49Eph 5:23 For the husband is the head of his wife as the Messiah is the head of the church. It is he who is the Savior of the body.
49Eph 5:24 Indeed, just as the church is submissive to the Messiah, so wives must be submissive to their husbands in everything. 
49Eph 5:25 Husbands, love your wives as the Messiah loved the church and gave himself for it,
49Eph 5:26 so that he might make it holy by cleansing it, washing it with water and the word,
49Eph 5:27 and might present the church to himself in all its glory, without a spot or wrinkle or anything of the kind, but holy and without fault.
49Eph 5:28 In the same way, husbands must love their wives as they love their own bodies. A man who loves his wife loves himself.
49Eph 5:29 For no one has ever hated his own body, but he nourishes and tenderly cares for it, as the Messiah does the church.
49Eph 5:30 For we are parts of his body - of his flesh and of his bones.
49Eph 5:31 "That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh."
49Eph 5:32 This is a great secret, but I am talking about the Messiah and the church.
49Eph 5:33 But each individual man among you must love his wife as he loves himself; and may the wife fear her husband.532
49Eph 6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is the right thing to do.
49Eph 6:2 "Honor your father and mother¡¦" (This is a very important commandment with a promise.)
49Eph 6:3 "¡¦so that it may go well for you, and that you may have a long life on the earth."
49Eph 6:4 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up by training and instructing them about the Lord.
49Eph 6:5 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear, trembling, and sincerity, as when you obey the Messiah.
49Eph 6:6 Do not do this only while you're being watched in order to please them, but be like slaves of the Messiah, who are determined to obey God's will.
49Eph 6:7 Serve willingly, as if you were serving the Lord and not merely people,
49Eph 6:8 because you know that everyone will receive a reward from the Lord for whatever good he has done, whether he is a slave or free. 
49Eph 6:9 Masters, treat your slaves the same way. Do not threaten them, for you know that both of you have the same Master in heaven, and there is no favoritism with him. 
49Eph 6:10 Finally, be strong in the Lord, relying on his mighty strength.
49Eph 6:11 Put on the whole armor of God so that you may be able to stand firm against the devil's strategies.
49Eph 6:12 For our struggle is not against human opponents, but against rulers, authorities, cosmic powers in the darkness around us, and evil spiritual forces in the heavenly realm.
49Eph 6:13 For this reason, take up the whole armor of God so that you may be able to take a stand whenever evil comes. And when you have done everything you could, you will be able to stand firm. 
49Eph 6:14 Stand firm, therefore, having fastened the belt of truth around your waist, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
49Eph 6:15 and being firm-footed in the gospel of peace.
49Eph 6:16 In addition to having clothed yourselves with these things, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to put out all the flaming arrows of the evil one,
49Eph 6:17 also take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God.
49Eph 6:18 Pray in the Spirit at all times with every kind of prayer and request. Likewise, be alert with your most diligent efforts and pray for all the saints.
49Eph 6:19 Pray also for me, so that, when I begin to speak, the right words will come to me. Then I will boldly make known the secret of the gospel,
49Eph 6:20 for whose sake I am an ambassador in chains, desiring to declare the gospel as boldly as I should.
49Eph 6:21 So that you may know what has happened to me and how I am doing, Tychicus, our dear brother and a faithful minister in service to the Lord, will tell you everything.
49Eph 6:22 I am sending him to you for this very reason, so that you may know how we are doing and that he may encourage your hearts.
49Eph 6:23 May peace and love, with faith, be with the brothers, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah!
49Eph 6:24 May grace be with all who sincerely love the Lord Jesus, the Messiah!

50Php 1:1 From£º Paul and Timothy, servants of the Messiah Jesus. To£º All the holy ones in Philippi, along with their overseers and ministers, who are in union with the Messiah Jesus.
50Php 1:2 May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be yours! 
50Php 1:3 I thank my God every time I remember you,
50Php 1:4 always praying joyfully in every one of my prayers for all of you
50Php 1:5 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.
50Php 1:6 I am convinced of this, that the one who began a good action among you will bring it to completion by the Day of the Messiah Jesus.
50Php 1:7 For it is only right for me to think this way about all of you, because you're constantly on my mind. Both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, all of you are partners with me in this privilege.
50Php 1:8 For God is my witness how much I long for all of you with the compassion that the Messiah Jesus provides.
50Php 1:9 And this is my prayer, that your love will keep on growing more and more with full knowledge and insight,
50Php 1:10 so that you may be able to choose what is best and be pure and blameless until the day when the Messiah returns,
50Php 1:11 having been filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus the Messiah so that God will be glorified and praised. 
50Php 1:12 Now I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has actually caused the gospel to advance.
50Php 1:13 As a result, it has become clear to the whole imperial guard and to everyone else that I am in prison for preaching about the Messiah.
50Php 1:14 Moreover, because of my imprisonment the Lord has caused most of the brothers to become confident to speak God's word more boldly and courageously than ever before.
50Php 1:15 Some are preaching the Messiah because of jealousy and dissension, while others do so because of their good will.
50Php 1:16 The latter are motivated by love, because they know that I have been appointed to defend the gospel.
50Php 1:17 The former proclaim the Messiah because they are selfishly ambitious and insincere, thinking that they will stir up trouble for me during my imprisonment.
50Php 1:18 But so what? Just this - that in every way, whether by false or true motives, the Messiah is being proclaimed. Because of this, I rejoice and will continue to rejoice.
50Php 1:19 I know that this will result in my deliverance through your prayers and the help that comes from the Spirit of Jesus the Messiah.
50Php 1:20 I rejoice because I eagerly expect and hope that I will have nothing to be ashamed of, because through my boldness the Messiah will be exalted through me, now as always, whether I live or die.
50Php 1:21 For to me, to go on living is the Messiah, and to die is gain.
50Php 1:22 Now if I continue living, fruitful labor is the result, so I do not know which I would prefer.
50Php 1:23 Indeed, I cannot decide between the two. I have the desire to leave this life and be with the Messiah, for that is far better.
50Php 1:24 But for your sake it is better that I remain alive.
50Php 1:25 Since I am convinced of this, I know that I will continue to live and be with all of you, so you will mature in the faith and know joy in it.
50Php 1:26 Then your rejoicing in the Messiah Jesus will increase along with mine when I visit with you again. 
50Php 1:27 The only thing that matters is that you continue to live as good citizens in a manner worthy of the gospel of the Messiah. Then, whether I come to see you or whether I stay away, I may hear all about you - that you are standing firm in one spirit, struggling with one mind for the faith of the gospel,
50Php 1:28 and that you are not intimidated by your opponents in any way. This is evidence that they will be destroyed and that you will be saved - and all because of God.
50Php 1:29 For you have been given the privilege for the Messiah's sake not only to believe in him but also to suffer for him.
50Php 1:30 You have the same struggle that you saw in me and now hear that I am still having.
50Php 2:1 Therefore, if there is any encouragement in the Messiah, if there is any comfort of love, if there is any fellowship in the Spirit, if there is any compassion and sympathy,
50Php 2:2 then fill me with joy by having the same attitude, sharing the same love, being united in spirit, and keeping one purpose in mind.
50Php 2:3 Do not act out of selfish ambition or conceit, but with humility think of others as being better than yourselves.
50Php 2:4 Do not be concerned about your own interests, but also be concerned about the interests of others.
50Php 2:5 Have the same attitude among yourselves that was also in the Messiah Jesus£º
50Php 2:6 In God's own form existed he, and shared with God equality, deemed nothing needed grasping.
50Php 2:7 Instead, poured out in emptiness, a servant's form did he possess, a mortal man becoming. In human form he chose to be,
50Php 2:8 and lived in all humility, death on a cross obeying.
50Php 2:9 Now lifted up by God to heaven, a name above all others given, this matchless name possessing.
50Php 2:10 And so, when Jesus' name is called, the knees of everyone should fall wherever they're residing.
50Php 2:11 Then every tongue in one accord, will say that Jesus the Messiah is Lord, while God the Father praising.
50Php 2:12 And so, my dear friends, just as you have always obeyed, not only when I was with you but even more now that I am absent, continue to work out your salvation with fear and trembling.
50Php 2:13 For it is God who is producing in you both the desire and the ability to do what pleases him.
50Php 2:14 Do everything without complaining or arguing
50Php 2:15 so that you may be blameless and innocent, God's children without any faults among a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine like stars in the world
50Php 2:16 as you hold firmly to the word of life. Then I will be proud when the Messiah returns that I did not run in vain or work hard in vain. 
50Php 2:17 Yet even if I am being poured out like an offering as part of the sacrifice and service I offer for your faith, I rejoice, and I share my joy with all of you.
50Php 2:18 In the same way, you also should rejoice and share your joy with me.
50Php 2:19 Now I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon so that I can be encouraged when I learn of your condition.
50Php 2:20 I do not have anyone else like him who takes a genuine interest in your welfare.
50Php 2:21 For all the others look after their own interests, not after those of Jesus the Messiah.
50Php 2:22 But you know his proven worth - how like a son with his father he served with me in the gospel.
50Php 2:23 Therefore, I hope to send him as soon as I see how things are going to turn out for me.
50Php 2:24 Indeed, I am confident in the Lord that I will come to visit you soon.
50Php 2:25 Meanwhile, I thought it best to send Epaphroditus - my brother, fellow worker, and fellow soldier, but your messenger and minister to my need - back to you.
50Php 2:26 For he has been longing for all of you and is troubled because you heard that he was sick.
50Php 2:27 Indeed, he was sick to the point of death, but God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me, so that I would not have one sorrow on top of another.
50Php 2:28 Therefore, I am especially eager to send him so that you may have the joy of seeing him again, and so that I may feel relieved.
50Php 2:29 So joyfully welcome him in the Lord and make sure you honor such people highly,
50Php 2:30 because he came close to death for the work of the Messiah by risking his life to complete what remained unfinished in your service to me.226
50Php 3:1 So then, my brothers, keep on rejoicing in the Lord. It is no trouble for me to write the same things to you; indeed, it is for your safety. 
50Php 3:2 Beware of the dogs! Beware of the evil workers! Beware of the mutilators!
50Php 3:3 For it is we who are the circumcision - we who worship in the Spirit of God and find our joy in the Messiah Jesus. We have not placed any confidence in the flesh,
50Php 3:4 although I could have confidence in the flesh. If anyone thinks he can place confidence in the flesh, I have more reason to think so.
50Php 3:5 Having been circumcised on the eighth day, I am of the nation of Israel, from the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews. As far as the law is concerned, I was a Pharisee.
50Php 3:6 As for my zeal, I was a persecutor of the church. As far as righteousness in the law is concerned, I was blameless.
50Php 3:7 But whatever things were assets to me, these I now consider a loss for the sake of the Messiah.
50Php 3:8 What is more, I continue to consider all these things to be a loss for the sake of what is far more valuable, knowing the Messiah Jesus, my Lord. It is because of him that I have experienced the loss of all those things. Indeed, I consider them rubbish in order to gain the Messiah
50Php 3:9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but one that comes through the faithfulness of the Messiah, the righteousness that comes from God and that depends on faith.
50Php 3:10 I want to know the Messiah - what his resurrection power is like and what it means to share in his sufferings by becoming like him in his death,
50Php 3:11 though I hope to experience the resurrection from the dead. 
50Php 3:12 It's not that I have already reached this goal or have already become perfect. But I keep pursuing it, hoping somehow to embrace it just as I have been embraced by the Messiah Jesus.
50Php 3:13 Brothers, I do not consider myself to have embraced it yet. But this one thing I do£º Forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,
50Php 3:14 I keep pursuing the goal to win the prize of God's heavenly call in the Messiah Jesus.3
50Php 3:15 Therefore, those of us who are mature should think this way. And if you think differently about anything, God will show you how to think.
50Php 3:16 However, we should live up to what we have achieved so far. 
50Php 3:17 Join together in imitating me, brothers, and pay close attention to those who live by the example we have set for you.
50Php 3:18 For I have often told you, and now tell you even with tears, that many live as enemies of the cross of the Messiah.
50Php 3:19 Their destiny is destruction, their god is their belly, and their glory is in their shame. Their minds are set on worldly things. 
50Php 3:20 Our citizenship, however, is in heaven, and it is from there that we eagerly wait for a Savior, the Lord Jesus, the Messiah.
50Php 3:21 He will change our unassuming bodies and make them like his glorious body through the power that enables him to bring everything under his authority. 
50Php 4:1 Therefore, my dear brothers whom I long for, my joy and my victor's crown, this is how you must stand firm in the Lord, dear friends.
50Php 4:2 I urge Euodia and Syntyche to have the same attitude in the Lord.
50Php 4:3 Yes, I also ask you, my true partner, to help these women. They have worked hard with me to advance the gospel, along with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the Book of Life. 
50Php 4:4 Keep on rejoicing in the Lord at all times. I will say it again£º Keep on rejoicing!
50Php 4:5 Let your gracious attitude be known to all people. The Lord is near£º
50Php 4:6 Never worry about anything. Instead, in every situation let your petitions be made known to God through prayers and requests, with thanksgiving.
50Php 4:7 Then God's peace, which goes far beyond anything we can imagine, will guard your hearts and minds in union with the Messiah Jesus.6
50Php 4:8 Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is fair, whatever is pure, whatever is acceptable, whatever is commendable, if there is anything of excellence and if there is anything praiseworthy - keep thinking about these things.
50Php 4:9 Likewise, keep practicing these things£º what you have learned, received, heard, and seen in me. Then the God of peace will be with you. 
50Php 4:10 Now I rejoice in the Lord greatly, because once again you have shown your concern for me. Of course, you were concerned for me but you did not have an opportunity to show it.
50Php 4:11 I am not saying this because I am in any need, for I have learned to be content in whatever situation I am in.
50Php 4:12 I know how to be humble, and I know how to prosper. In each and every situation I have learned the secret of being full and of going hungry, of having too much and of having too little.
50Php 4:13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
50Php 4:14 Nevertheless, it was kind of you to share my troubles.
50Php 4:15 You Philippians also know that in the early days of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church participated with me in the matter of giving and receiving except for you.
50Php 4:16 Even while I was in Thessalonica, you provided for my needs not once, but twice.
50Php 4:17 It is not that I am looking for a gift. No, I want to see that you receive the fruit that increases to your benefit.
50Php 4:18 I have been paid in full and have more than enough. I am fully supplied, now that I have received from Epaphroditus what you sent - a fragrant aroma, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.
50Php 4:19 And my God will fully supply your every need according to his glorious riches in the Messiah Jesus.
50Php 4:20 Glory belongs to our God and Father forever and ever! Amen. 
50Php 4:21 Greet every saint who is union with the Messiah Jesus. The brothers who are with me send their greetings to you.
50Php 4:22 All the saints, especially those of the emperor's household, greet you. 
50Php 4:23 May the grace of the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be with your spirit! Amen.
51
51Col 1:1 From£º Paul, an apostle of the Messiah Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother.
51Col 1:2 To£º The holy and faithful brothers in Colossae who are in union with the Messiah. May grace and peace from God our Father be yours!
51Col 1:3 We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, praying always for you,
51Col 1:4 because we have heard about your faith in the Messiah Jesus and the love that you have for all the saints,
51Col 1:5 based on the hope laid up for you in heaven. Some time ago you heard about this hope through the word of truth, the gospel
51Col 1:6 that has come to you. Just as it is bearing fruit and spreading all over the world, so it has been doing among you from the day you heard it and came to know the grace of God in truth.
51Col 1:7 You learned about this gospel from Epaphras, our dear fellow servant, who is a faithful minister of the Messiah on your behalf.
51Col 1:8 He has told us about your love in the Spirit. 
51Col 1:9 For this reason, since the day we heard about this, we have not stopped praying for you and asking that you may be filled with the full knowledge of God's will with respect to all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
51Col 1:10 so that you might live in a manner worthy of the Lord and be fully pleasing to him as you bear fruit while doing all kinds of good things and growing in the full knowledge of God.
51Col 1:11 You are being strengthened with all power according to his glorious might, so that you might patiently endure everything with joy
51Col 1:12 and might thank the Father, who has enabled us to share in the saints' inheritance in the light.
51Col 1:13 God has rescued us from the power of darkness and has brought us into the kingdom of the Son whom he loves,
51Col 1:14 through whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
51Col 1:15 The Son is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn over all creation.
51Col 1:16 For by him all things in heaven and on earth were created, things visible and invisible, whether they are kings, lords, rulers, or powers. All things have been created through him and for him.
51Col 1:17 He himself existed before anything else did, and he holds all things together.
51Col 1:18 He is also the head of the body, which is the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he himself might have first place in everything.
51Col 1:19 For God was pleased to have all of his divine essence inhabit him.
51Col 1:20 Through the Son, God also reconciled all things to himself, whether things on earth or things in heaven, thereby making peace through the blood of his cross. 
51Col 1:21 You who were once alienated with a hostile attitude, doing evil,
51Col 1:22 he has now reconciled by the death of his physical body, so that he may present you holy, blameless, and without fault before him.
51Col 1:23 However, you must remain firmly established and steadfast in the faith, without being moved from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed to every creature under heaven and of which I, Paul, have become a servant.
51Col 1:24 Now I am rejoicing while suffering for you as I complete in my flesh whatever remains of the Messiah's sufferings on behalf of his body, which is the church.
51Col 1:25 I became its servant as God commissioned me to work for you, so that I may complete my ministry of the word of God.
51Col 1:26 This secret was hidden throughout the ages and generations but has now been revealed to his saints,
51Col 1:27 to whom God wanted to make known the glorious riches of this secret among the gentiles - which is the Messiah in you, our glorious hope.
51Col 1:28 It is he whom we proclaim as we admonish and wisely teach everyone, so that we may present everyone mature in the Messiah.
51Col 1:29 I work hard and struggle to do this, using the energy that he powerfully provides in me.128
51Col 2:1 For I want you to know how much I struggle for you, for those in Laodicea, and for all who have never seen me face to face.
51Col 2:2 Because they are united in love, I pray that their hearts may be encouraged by all the riches that come from a complete understanding of the full knowledge of the Messiah, who is the mystery of God.
51Col 2:3 In him are stored all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
51Col 2:4 I say this so that no one will mislead you with nice-sounding rhetoric.
51Col 2:5 For although I am physically absent, I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see how stable you are and how firm your faith in the Messiah is.
51Col 2:6 So then, just as you have received the Messiah Jesus the Lord, continue to live dependent on him.
51Col 2:7 For you have been rooted in him and are being built up and strengthened in the faith, just as you were taught, while you continue to be thankful.
51Col 2:8 See to it that no one enslaves you through philosophy and empty deceit according to human tradition, according to the basic principles of the world, and not according to the Messiah,
51Col 2:9 because all the essence of deity inhabits him in bodily form.
51Col 2:10 And you have been filled by him, who is the head of every ruler and authority.
51Col 2:11 In union with him you were also circumcised with a circumcision performed without human hands by stripping off the corrupt nature by the circumcision performed by the Messiah.
51Col 2:12 When you were buried with the Messiah in baptism, you were also raised with him through faith in the power of God, who raised him from the dead.
51Col 2:13 Even when you were dead because of your offenses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made you alive with him when he forgave us all of our offenses,
51Col 2:14 having erased the charges that were brought against us, along with their obligations that were hostile to us. He took those charges away when he nailed them to the cross.
51Col 2:15 And when he had disarmed the rulers and the authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them in the cross.
51Col 2:16 Therefore, let no one judge you in matters of food and drink or with respect to a festival, a new moon, or Sabbath days.
51Col 2:17 These are a shadow of the things to come, but the reality belongs to the Messiah.
51Col 2:18 Let no one who delights in humility and the worship of angels cheat you out of the prize by rejoicing about what he has seen. Such a person is puffed up for no reason by his carnal mind.
51Col 2:19 He does not hold on to the head, from whom the whole body, which is nourished and held together by its joints and ligaments, grows as God enables it.182
51Col 2:20 If you have died with the Messiah to the basic principles of the world, why are you submitting to its decrees as though you still lived in the world - 
51Col 2:21 "Don't handle this! Don't taste or touch that!"
51Col 2:22 All of these things will be destroyed as they are used, because they are based on human commands and teachings.
51Col 2:23 These things have the appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion, humility, and harsh treatment of the body, but they have no value against self-indulgence.220
51Col 3:1 Therefore, if you have been raised with the Messiah, keep focusing on the things that are above, where the Messiah is seated at the right hand of God.
51Col 3:2 Keep your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on the earth.
51Col 3:3 For you have died, and your life has been safely guarded by the Messiah in God.
51Col 3:4 When the Messiah, who is your life, is revealed, then you, too, will be revealed with him in glory. 
51Col 3:5 So put to death your worldly impulses£º sexual sin, impurity, passion, evil desire, and greed (which is idolatry).
51Col 3:6 It is because of these things that the wrath of God is coming on those who are disobedient.
51Col 3:7 You used to behave like them as you lived among them.
51Col 3:8 But now you must also get rid of anger, wrath, malice, slander, obscene speech, and all such sins.
51Col 3:9 Do not lie to one another, for you have stripped off the old nature with its practices
51Col 3:10 and have clothed yourselves with the new nature, which is being renewed in full knowledge, consistent with the image of the one who created it.
51Col 3:11 In him there is no Greek or Jew, circumcised or uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, or free person. Instead, the Messiah is all and in all.
51Col 3:12 Therefore, as God's chosen ones, holy and loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience.
51Col 3:13 Be tolerant of one another and forgive each other if anyone has a complaint against another. Just as the Lord has forgiven you, you also should forgive.
51Col 3:14 Above all, clothe yourselves with love, which ties everything together in unity.
51Col 3:15 Let the peace of the Messiah also rule in your hearts, to which you were called in one body, and be thankful.
51Col 3:16 Let the word of the Messiah inhabit you richly with wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and singing to God with thankfulness in your hearts.
51Col 3:17 And whatever you do, whether by speech or action, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him. 
51Col 3:18 Wives, submit yourselves to your husbands, as is appropriate for those who belong to the Lord.
51Col 3:19 Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them. 
51Col 3:20 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this is pleasing to the Lord.
51Col 3:21 Fathers, do not make your children resentful. Otherwise, they'll become discouraged. 
51Col 3:22 Slaves, obey your earthly masters in everything, not only while being watched in order to please them, but with a sincere heart, fearing the Lord.
51Col 3:23 Whatever you do, work at it wholeheartedly as though you were doing it for the Lord and not merely for people.
51Col 3:24 You know that it is from the Lord that you will receive the inheritance as a reward. It is the Lord Messiah whom you are serving!
51Col 3:25 For the person who does what is wrong will be paid back for what he has done without favoritism.
51Col 4:1 Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, because you know that you also have a Master in heaven. 
51Col 4:2 Devote yourselves to prayer. Be alert and thankful when you pray.
51Col 4:3 At the same time also pray for us - that God would open before us a door for the word so that we may tell the secret about the Messiah, for which I have been imprisoned.
51Col 4:4 May I reveal it as clearly as I should!
51Col 4:5 Behave wisely toward outsiders, making the best use of your time.
51Col 4:6 Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer everyone. 
51Col 4:7 Tychicus will tell you everything that has happened to me. He is a dear brother, a faithful minister, and a fellow servant in the Lord.
51Col 4:8 I am sending him to you for this very reason, so that you may know how we are doing and that he may encourage your hearts.
51Col 4:9 He is coming with Onesimus, that faithful and dear brother, who is one of you. They will tell you everything that is happening here.
51Col 4:10 Aristarchus, my fellow prisoner, sends his greetings, as does Mark, the cousin of Barnabas. You have received instructions about him. If he comes to you, welcome him.
51Col 4:11 Jesus, who is called Justus, also greets you. These are the only ones of the circumcision who are fellow workers for the kingdom of God. They have been an encouragement to me.
51Col 4:12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of the Messiah Jesus, sends you his greetings. He is always wrestling in his prayers for you, so that you may stand mature, completely convinced of the entire will of God.
51Col 4:13 For I can testify on his behalf that he has a deep concern for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hieropolis.
51Col 4:14 Luke, the beloved physician, and Demas greet you.
51Col 4:15 Give my greetings to the brothers in Laodicea, especially to Nympha and the church that is in her house.
51Col 4:16 When this letter has been read among you, have it read also in the church of the Laodiceans, and be sure to read the one from Laodicea.
51Col 4:17 Tell Archippus, "See that you complete the ministry you have received from the Lord."413
51Col 4:18 This greeting is written with my own signature?"Paul." Remember that I remain imprisoned. May grace be with you! Amen.
52
521Th 1:1 From£º Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy. To£º The church of the Thessalonians in union with God the Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah. May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be yours! 
521Th 1:2 We always thank God for all of you when we mention you in our prayers.
521Th 1:3 In the presence of our God and Father, we constantly remember how your faith is active, your love is hard at work, and your hope in our Lord Jesus the Messiah is enduring.
521Th 1:4 Brothers whom God loves, we know that he has chosen you,
521Th 1:5 for the gospel we brought did not come to you in words only, but also with power, with the Holy Spirit, and with deep conviction. Indeed, you know what kind of people we proved to be while we were with you, acting on your behalf. 
521Th 1:6 You became imitators of us and of the Lord. In spite of a great deal of suffering, you welcomed the word with the joy that the Holy Spirit produces.
521Th 1:7 As a result, you became a model for all the believers in Macedonia and Achaia.
521Th 1:8 From you the word of the Lord has spread out not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but also in every place where your faith in God has become known. As a result, we do not need to say anything about it.
521Th 1:9 For people keep telling us what kind of welcome you gave us and how you turned away from idols to serve a living and true God
521Th 1:10 and to wait for his Son whom he raised from the dead to come back from heaven. This Jesus is the one who rescues us from the coming wrath. 
521Th 2:1 For you yourselves know, brothers, that our visit to you was not a waste of time.
521Th 2:2 As you know, we suffered persecution and were mistreated in Philippi. Yet we were encouraged by our God to tell you his gospel in spite of strong opposition.
521Th 2:3 For our appeal to you does not spring from deceit, impure motives, or trickery.
521Th 2:4 Rather, because we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, we speak as we do, not trying to please people but God, who tests our motives.23
521Th 2:5 As you know, we did not come with flattering words or with a scheme to make money. God is our witness!
521Th 2:6 We did not seek praise from people - from you or from anyone else - 
521Th 2:7 even though as apostles of the Messiah we might have made such demands. Instead, we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother tenderly caring for her own children.
521Th 2:8 We cared so deeply for you that we were determined to share with you not only the gospel of God but our very lives. That is how dear you were to us.
521Th 2:9 Brothers, you remember our labor and toil. We worked night and day so that we would not become a burden to any of you while we proclaimed the gospel of God to you.
521Th 2:10 You and God are witnesses of how pure, honest, and blameless our conduct was among you who believe.
521Th 2:11 You know very well that we treated each of you the way a father treats his children.
521Th 2:12 We comforted and encouraged you, urging you to live in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into his kingdom and glory. 
521Th 2:13 Here is another reason why we constantly give thanks to God£º When you received God's word, which you heard from us, you did not accept it as the word of humans but for what it really is - the word of God, which is at work in you who believe.
521Th 2:14 For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Judea that are in union with the Messiah Jesus. You suffered the same persecutions from the people of your own country as they did from those Jews
521Th 2:15 who killed the Lord Jesus and the prophets, who have persecuted us, and who please neither God nor any group of people,
521Th 2:16 as they try to keep us from telling the gentiles how they can be saved. As a result, they are constantly adding to the number of sins they have committed. However, wrath has overtaken them at last!
521Th 2:17 Brothers, although we have been separated from you for a little while - in person but not in heart - we eagerly desire to see you again face to face.
521Th 2:18 That is why we wanted to come to you. Certainly I, Paul, wanted to come time and again, but Satan blocked our way.
521Th 2:19 After all, who is our hope, joy, or reason for rejoicing in the presence of our Lord Jesus at his coming? It is you, isn't it - 
521Th 2:20 Yes, you are our glory and joy!
521Th 3:1 Therefore, when we could stand it no longer, we decided to remain alone in Athens
521Th 3:2 and send Timothy, our brother who works with us for God in the gospel of the Messiah, to strengthen and encourage you in your faith,
521Th 3:3 so that no one would be shaken by these persecutions, for which you are aware that we were destined.
521Th 3:4 In fact, when we were with you, we told you ahead of time that we were going to suffer persecution. And as you know, that is what happened.
521Th 3:5 But when I could stand it no longer, I sent Timothy to find out about your faith. I was afraid that the tempter had tempted you in some way, and that our work had been a waste of time. 
521Th 3:6 But Timothy has just now returned from visiting you and has told us the good news about your faith and love. He also told us that you always have fond memories of us and want to see us, just as we want to see you.
521Th 3:7 That's why, brothers, in all our distress and persecution we have been encouraged about you by your faith.
521Th 3:8 For now we can go on living, as long as you continue to stand firm in the Lord.
521Th 3:9 How can we thank God enough for you in return for all the joy that we have in God's presence because of you - 
521Th 3:10 We pray very hard night and day that we may see you again face to face, so that we may equip you with whatever is lacking in your faith.
521Th 3:11 Now may our God and Father and our Lord Jesus provide a way for us to visit you.
521Th 3:12 May the Lord greatly increase your love for each other and for all people, just as we love you.
521Th 3:13 Then your hearts will be strong, blameless, and holy in the presence of God, who is our Father, when our Lord Jesus appears with all his saints.3
521Th 4:1 Now then, brothers, you learned from us how you ought to live and to please God, as in fact you are doing. We ask and encourage you in the Lord to do so even more.
521Th 4:2 You know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
521Th 4:3 For it is God's will that you be sanctified£º You must abstain from sexual immorality.
521Th 4:4 Each of you must know how to control his own body in a holy and honorable manner,
521Th 4:5 not with passion and lust like the gentiles who do not know God.
521Th 4:6 Furthermore, you must never take advantage of or exploit a brother in this regard, because the Lord avenges all these things, just as we already told you and warned you.
521Th 4:7 For God did not call us to be impure, but to be holy.
521Th 4:8 Therefore, whoever rejects this instruction is not rejecting human authority but God, who gives you his Holy Spirit. 
521Th 4:9 Now you do not need anyone to write to you about brotherly love, since you have been taught by God to love each other.
521Th 4:10 In fact, you are showing love to all the brothers throughout Macedonia, but we urge you, brothers, to keep on doing this even more.
521Th 4:11 Also, make it your goal to live quietly, to mind your own business, and to work with your own hands, as we instructed you,
521Th 4:12 so that you may win the respect of outsiders, and have need of nothing.
521Th 4:13 But we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, about those who have died, so that you may not grieve like other people who have no hope.
521Th 4:14 For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so through Jesus God will bring those who have died with him.
521Th 4:15 For we declare to you what the Lord has told us to say£º We who are alive and remain until the coming of the Lord will by no means precede those who have died.
521Th 4:16 With a shout of command, with the archangel's call, and with the sound of God's trumpet, the Lord himself will come down from heaven, and the dead who belong to the Messiah will rise first.
521Th 4:17 Then we who are alive and remain will be caught up in the clouds together with them to meet the Lord in the air. And so we will be with the Lord forever.
521Th 4:18 So then, encourage one another with these words. 
521Th 5:1 Now you do not need to have anything written to you about times and dates, brothers,
521Th 5:2 for you yourselves know very well that the Day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
521Th 5:3 When people say, "There is peace and security," destruction will strike them as suddenly as labor pains come to a pregnant woman, and they will not be able to escape. 
521Th 5:4 However, brothers, you are not in the darkness, in order that the Day of the Lord might surprise you like a thief.
521Th 5:5 For all of you are children of the light and children of the day. We do not belong to the night or to darkness.
521Th 5:6 Therefore, let's not fall asleep like others do, but let's stay awake and be sober.
521Th 5:7 For people who go to sleep, go to sleep at night; and people who get drunk, get drunk at night.
521Th 5:8 But since we belong to the day, let's be sober. We must put on the breastplate of faith and love, and the hope of salvation as a helmet.
521Th 5:9 For God has not destined us to receive wrath but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus, the Messiah,
521Th 5:10 who died for us in order that, whether we are awake or asleep, we may live together with him.
521Th 5:11 So then, encourage one another and build each other up, as you are doing. 
521Th 5:12 Brothers, we ask you to show your appreciation for those who work among you, set an example for you in the Lord, and instruct you.
521Th 5:13 Hold them in the highest regard, loving them because of their work. Live in peace with each other.
521Th 5:14 We urge you, brothers, to admonish those who are idle, cheer up those who are discouraged, and help those who are weak. Be patient with everyone.
521Th 5:15 Make sure that no one pays back evil for evil. Instead, always pursue what is good for each other and for everyone else.
521Th 5:16 Always be joyful.
521Th 5:17 Continually be prayerful.
521Th 5:18 In everything be thankful, because this is God's will for you in the Messiah Jesus.
521Th 5:19 Do not put out the Spirit's fire.
521Th 5:20 Do not despise prophecies.
521Th 5:21 Instead, test everything. Hold on to what is good.
521Th 5:22 Keep away from every kind of evil.14
521Th 5:23 May the God of peace himself make you holy in every way. And may your whole being - spirit, soul, and body - remain blameless when our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, appears.
521Th 5:24 The one who calls you is faithful, and he will continue to be faithful.
521Th 5:25 Brothers, pray for us.
521Th 5:26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
521Th 5:27 I order you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.
521Th 5:28 May the grace of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be with you! Amen.

532Th 1:1 From£º Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy. To£º The church of the Thessalonians in union with God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah.
532Th 1:2 May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be yours! 
532Th 1:3 Brothers, at all times we are obligated to thank God for you. It is right to do this because your faith is growing all the time and the love every one of you has for each other is increasing.
532Th 1:4 As a result, we rejoice about you among God's churches - about your endurance and faith through all the persecutions and afflictions you are experiencing.
532Th 1:5 This is evidence of God's righteous judgment and is intended to make you worthy of God's kingdom, for which you are suffering.
532Th 1:6 Certainly it is right for God to pay back those who afflict you with affliction
532Th 1:7 and to give us who are afflicted relief when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
532Th 1:8 in blazing fire. He will take revenge on those who do not know God and on those who refuse to obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
532Th 1:9 Such people will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction by being separated from the Lord's presence and from his glorious power,
532Th 1:10 when he comes to be glorified by his saints and to be regarded with wonder on that day by all who have believed - including you - because you believed our testimony. 
532Th 1:11 With this in mind, we always pray for you, asking that our God might make you worthy of his calling and that through his power he might help you accomplish every good desire and faithful action.
532Th 1:12 That way the name of our Lord Jesus will be glorified by you, and you by him, according to the grace of our God and Lord, Jesus, the Messiah. 
532Th 2:1 Now we ask you, brothers, regarding the coming of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, and our gathering together to him,
532Th 2:2 not to be so quickly upset or alarmed when someone claims that we said, either by some spirit, conversation, or letter that the Day of the Lord has already come.
532Th 2:3 Do not let anyone deceive you in any way, for it shall not come unless the rebellion takes place first and the man of sin, who is destined for destruction, is revealed.
532Th 2:4 He opposes and exalts himself above every so-called god and object of worship. As a result, he seats himself in the sanctuary of God and himself declares that he is God.2
532Th 2:5 Don't you remember that I repeatedly told you about these things when I was still with you - 
532Th 2:6 You know what it is that is now holding him back, so that he will be revealed when his time comes.
532Th 2:7 For the secret of this lawlessness is already at work, but only until the person now holding it back gets out of the way.
532Th 2:8 Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will destroy with the breath of his mouth, rendering him powerless by the manifestation of his coming.
532Th 2:9 The coming of the lawless one will be accompanied by the power of Satan. He will use every kind of power, including miraculous signs, lying wonders,
532Th 2:10 and every type of evil to deceive those who are dying, those who refused to love the truth that would save them.
532Th 2:11 For this reason, God will send them a powerful delusion so that they will believe the lie.
532Th 2:12 Then all who have not believed the truth but have taken pleasure in unrighteousness will be condemned. 
532Th 2:13 At all times we are obligated to thank God for you, brothers who are loved by the Lord, because God chose you to be the first fruits for salvation through sanctification by the Spirit and through faith in the truth.
532Th 2:14 With this purpose in mind, he called you through our proclamation of the gospel so that you would obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah.
532Th 2:15 So then, brothers, stand firm, and cling to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by word of mouth or by our letter.
532Th 2:16 May our Lord Jesus, the Messiah himself, and may God our Father, who loved us and by his grace gave us eternal comfort and good hope,
532Th 2:17 encourage your hearts and strengthen you in every good action and word. 
532Th 3:1 Finally, brothers, pray for us - that the word of the Lord may spread rapidly, and that it may be honored the way it is among you.
532Th 3:2 Also pray that we may be rescued from worthless and evil people, since not everyone holds to the faith.
532Th 3:3 But the Lord is faithful and will strengthen you and protect you from the evil one.
532Th 3:4 We have confidence in the Lord that you are doing and will continue to do what we command.
532Th 3:5 May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the endurance of the Messiah.4
532Th 3:6 In the name of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, we command you, brothers, to keep away from every brother who is living in idleness and not living according to the tradition that they received from us.
532Th 3:7 For you yourselves know what you must do to imitate us. We never lived in idleness among you.
532Th 3:8 We did not eat anyone's food without paying for it. Instead, with toil and labor we worked night and day in order not to be a burden to any of you.
532Th 3:9 It is not as though we did not have that right, but, we wanted to give you an example to follow.
532Th 3:10 While we were with you, we gave this order£º "If anyone doesn't want to work, he shouldn't eat." 
532Th 3:11 We hear that some of you are living in idleness. You are not busy working - you are busy interfering in other people's lives!
532Th 3:12 We order and encourage such people by the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, to do their work quietly and to earn their own living.
532Th 3:13 Brothers, do not get tired of doing what is right.
532Th 3:14 If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of him. Have nothing to do with him so that he will feel ashamed.
532Th 3:15 Yet, don't treat him like an enemy, but warn him like a brother.
532Th 3:16 Now may the Lord of peace give you his peace at all times and in every way. May the Lord be with all of you. 
532Th 3:17 I, Paul, am writing this greeting with my own hand. This is the mark in every letter of mine. It is the way I write.
532Th 3:18 May the grace of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be with all of you. Amen.

541Tm 1:1 From£º Paul, an apostle of the Messiah Jesus, by the command of God our Savior and the Messiah Jesus, our hope.
541Tm 1:2 To£º Timothy, my genuine child in the faith. May grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Messiah Jesus, our Lord, be yours! 
541Tm 1:3 When I was on my way to Macedonia, I urged you to stay in Ephesus so that you could instruct certain people to stop teaching false doctrine
541Tm 1:4 and occupying themselves with myths and endless genealogies. These things promote controversies rather than God's ongoing purpose, which involves faith.
541Tm 1:5 The goal of this instruction is love that flows from a pure heart, from a clear conscience, and from a sincere faith.
541Tm 1:6 Some people have left these qualities behind and have turned to fruitless discussion.
541Tm 1:7 They want to be teachers of the law, yet they do not understand either what they are talking about or the things about which they speak so confidently. 
541Tm 1:8 Of course, we know that the law is good if a person uses it legitimately,
541Tm 1:9 that is, if he understands that the law is not intended for righteous people but for lawbreakers and rebels, for ungodly people and sinners, for those who are unholy and irreverent, for those who kill their fathers, their mothers, or other people,
541Tm 1:10 for those involved in sexual immorality, for homosexuals, for kidnappers, for liars, for false witnesses, and for whatever else goes against the healthy teaching
541Tm 1:11 that agrees with the glorious gospel of the blessed God, which he entrusted to me. 
541Tm 1:12 I thank the Messiah Jesus, our Lord, who gives me strength, that he has considered me faithful and has appointed me to his service.
541Tm 1:13 In the past I was a blasphemer, a persecutor, and a violent man. But I received mercy because I acted ignorantly in my unbelief,
541Tm 1:14 and the grace of our Lord overflowed toward me, along with the faith and love that are in the Messiah Jesus.
541Tm 1:15 This is a trustworthy saying that deserves complete acceptance£º To this world Messiah came, sinful people to reclaim. I am the worst of them.
541Tm 1:16 But for that very reason I received mercy, so that in me, as the worst sinner, the Messiah Jesus might demonstrate all of his patience as an example for those who would believe in him for eternal life.
541Tm 1:17 Now to the King Eternal - the immortal, invisible, and only God - be honor and glory forever and ever! Amen.1 
541Tm 1:18 Timothy, my child, I am instructing you in keeping with the prophecies made earlier about you, so that by following them you may continue to fight the good fight
541Tm 1:19 with faith and a good conscience. By ignoring their consciences, some people have destroyed their faith like a wrecked ship.
541Tm 1:20 These include Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I handed over to Satan so that they may learn not to blaspheme. 
541Tm 2:1 First of all, then, I urge you to offer to God petitions, prayers, intercessions, and expressions of thanks for all people,
541Tm 2:2 for kings, and for everyone who has authority, so that we might lead a quiet and peaceful life with all godliness and dignity.
541Tm 2:3 This is good and acceptable in the sight of God our Savior,
541Tm 2:4 who wants all people to be saved and to come to know the truth fully.
541Tm 2:5 There is one God. There is also one mediator between God and human beings - a human, the Messiah Jesus.
541Tm 2:6 He gave himself as a ransom for everyone, the testimony at the proper time.
541Tm 2:7 For this reason I was appointed to be an announcer, an apostle, and a faithful and true teacher of the gentiles. (I am telling you the truth. I am not lying.)
541Tm 2:8 Therefore, I want the men to pray everywhere, lifting up holy hands without being angry or argumentative.
541Tm 2:9 Women, for their part, should display their beauty by dressing modestly and decently in appropriate clothes, not by braiding their hair or by wearing gold, pearls, or expensive clothes,
541Tm 2:10 but through good actions. This is proper for women who claim to revere God. 
541Tm 2:11 A woman must learn quietly and submissively.
541Tm 2:12 Moreover, I do not allow a woman to teach or to usurp authority over a man. Instead, she is to be quiet.
541Tm 2:13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve.
541Tm 2:14 And it was not Adam who was deceived. It was the woman who was deceived and became a lawbreaker.
541Tm 2:15 However, women will be saved by having children, if they continue to have faith, love, and holiness, along with good judgment.
541Tm 3:1 This is a trustworthy saying£º a noble task desires he.
541Tm 3:2 Therefore, an elder must be blameless, the husband of one wife, stable, sensible, respectable, hospitable to strangers, and teachable.
541Tm 3:3 He must not drink excessively or be a violent person, but instead be gentle. He must not be argumentative or love money.
541Tm 3:4 He must manage his own family well and have children who are submissive and respectful in every way.
541Tm 3:5 For if a man does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God's church - 
541Tm 3:6 He must not be a recent convert, so that he won't become arrogant and fall into the devil's condemnation.
541Tm 3:7 He must be well thought of by outsiders, so he doesn't fall into disgrace and the trap set for him by the devil. 
541Tm 3:8 Ministers, too, must be serious. They must not be two-faced, addicted to wine, or greedy for money.
541Tm 3:9 They must hold firmly to the secret of the faith with clear consciences.
541Tm 3:10 But they must first be tested. Then, if they prove to be blameless, they may become ministers.
541Tm 3:11 Their wives must also be serious. They must not be gossips, but instead be stable and trustworthy in everything.
541Tm 3:12 Ministers must be husbands of one wife and must manage their children and their families well.
541Tm 3:13 Those ministers who serve well gain an excellent reputation for themselves and will have great assurance by their faith in the Messiah Jesus.
541Tm 3:14 I hope to come to you soon. However, I'm writing this to you
541Tm 3:15 in case I am delayed, so that you may know how to behave in God's household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth.
541Tm 3:16 By common confession, the secret of our godly worship is great£º revealed to sight, kept righteous by the Spirit's might, adored by angels singing. To nations was he manifest, believing souls found peace and rest, our Lord in heaven reigning!
541Tm 4:1 Now the Spirit says clearly that in the last times some people will abandon the faith by following deceitful spirits, the teachings of demons,
541Tm 4:2 and the hypocrisy of liars, whose consciences have been burned by a hot iron.
541Tm 4:3 They will try to stop people from marrying and from eating certain foods, which God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
541Tm 4:4 For everything God created is good, and nothing should be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
541Tm 4:5 because it is sanctified by the word of God and prayer.41
541Tm 4:6 If you continue to point these things out to the brothers, you will be a good servant of the Messiah Jesus, nourished by the words of the faith and the healthy teaching that you have followed closely.
541Tm 4:7 Do not have anything to do with godless myths and fables of old women. Instead, train yourself to be godly.
541Tm 4:8 Physical exercise is of limited value, but a pledge of life, both there and here.
541Tm 4:9 This is a trustworthy saying that deserves complete acceptance.
541Tm 4:10 To this end we work hard and struggle, because we have set our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, that is, of those who believe. 
541Tm 4:11 These are the things you must insist on and teach.
541Tm 4:12 Do not let anyone look down on you because you are young, but be an example for other believers in your speech, behavior, love, faithfulness, and purity.
541Tm 4:13 Until I arrive, give your full concentration to the public reading of Scripture, to exhorting, and to teaching.
541Tm 4:14 Do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you through prophecy when the elders laid their hands on you.
541Tm 4:15 Think on these things. Devote your life to them so that everyone can see your progress.
541Tm 4:16 Pay close attention to your life and your teaching. Persevere in these things, because if you do so, you will save both yourself and those who listen to you.
541Tm 5:1 Never speak harshly to an older man, but appeal to him as if he were your father. Treat younger men like brothers,
541Tm 5:2 older women like mothers, and younger women like sisters, with absolute purity.
541Tm 5:3 Honor widows who have no other family members to care for them.
541Tm 5:4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, they must first learn to respect their own family by repaying their parents, for this is pleasing in God's sight.
541Tm 5:5 A woman who has no other family members to care for her and who is left all alone has placed her hope in God and devotes herself to petitions and prayers night and day.
541Tm 5:6 But the self-indulgent widow is just as good as dead.5
541Tm 5:7 Continue to give these instructions, so that they may be blameless.
541Tm 5:8 If anyone does not take care of his own relatives, especially his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
541Tm 5:9 A widow may be put on the widows' list if she is at least sixty years old and has been the wife of one husband.
541Tm 5:10 She must be well known for her good actions as a woman who has raised children, welcomed strangers, washed the saints' feet, helped the suffering, and devoted herself to doing good in every way.8
541Tm 5:11 But do not include younger widows on your list. For whenever their natural desires cause them to lose their devotion to the Messiah, they want to remarry.
541Tm 5:12 They receive condemnation because they have set aside their prior commitment to the Messiah.
541Tm 5:13 At the same time, they also learn how to be lazy while going from house to house. Not only this, but they even become gossips and keep busy by interfering in other people's lives, saying things they should not say. 
541Tm 5:14 Therefore, I want younger widows to remarry, have children, manage their homes, and not give the enemy any chance to ridicule them.
541Tm 5:15 For some widows have already turned away to follow Satan.
541Tm 5:16 If any woman is a believer and has relatives who are widows, she should help them. The church should not be burdened, so it can help those widows who have no other family members to care for them.
541Tm 5:17 Elders who handle their duties well should be considered worthy of double compensation, especially those who work hard at preaching and teaching.
541Tm 5:18 For the Scripture says, "You must not muzzle an ox while it is treading out grain," and "A worker deserves his pay."
541Tm 5:19 Do not accept an accusation against an elder unless it is supported "by two or three witnesses."
541Tm 5:20 As for those who keep on sinning, rebuke them in front of everyone so that the rest will also be afraid.
541Tm 5:21 With God as my witness, as well as the Messiah Jesus and the chosen angels, I solemnly call on you to carry out these instructions without prejudice, doing nothing on the basis of partiality.
541Tm 5:22 Do not ordain anyone hastily. Do not participate in the sins of others. Keep yourself pure.
541Tm 5:23 Stop drinking only water, but use a little wine for your stomach because of your frequent illnesses.520
541Tm 5:24 The sins of some people are obvious, leading them to judgment. The sins of others follow them there.
541Tm 5:25 In the same way, good actions are obvious, and those that are not cannot remain hidden.
541Tm 6:1 All who are under the yoke of slavery should regard their own masters as deserving of the highest respect, so that the name of God and our teaching may not be discredited.
541Tm 6:2 Moreover, those who have believing masters should be respectful to them, because they are fellow believers. In fact, they must serve them even better, because those who benefit from their service are believers and dear to them. These are the things you must teach and exhort. 
541Tm 6:3 If anyone teaches false doctrine and refuses to agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, and godly teaching,
541Tm 6:4 he is a conceited person and does not understand anything. He has an unhealthy craving for arguments and debates. This produces jealousy, rivalry, slander, evil suspicions,
541Tm 6:5 and incessant conflict between people who are depraved in mind and deprived of truth. They think that godliness is a way to make a profit.
541Tm 6:6 Of course, godliness with contentment does bring a great profit.
541Tm 6:7 Nothing to this world we bring; from it take we nothing.
541Tm 6:8 With food to eat and clothes to wear; content we are in everything.
541Tm 6:9 But people who want to get rich keep toppling into temptation and are trapped by many stupid and harmful desires that plunge them into destruction and ruin.
541Tm 6:10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. Some people, in their eagerness to get rich, have wandered away from the faith and caused themselves a lot of pain. 
541Tm 6:11 But you, man of God, must flee from all these things. Instead, you must pursue righteousness, godliness, faithfulness, love, endurance, and gentleness.
541Tm 6:12 Fight the good fight for the faith. Keep holding on to eternal life, to which you were called and about which you gave a good testimony in front of many witnesses.
541Tm 6:13 Since you are in the presence of God, who gives life to everything, and in the presence of the Messiah Jesus, who gave a good testimony before Pontius Pilate, I solemnly charge you
541Tm 6:14 to keep these commands stainlessly and blamelessly until the appearance of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah.
541Tm 6:15 At the right time, he will make him known. God is the blessed and only Ruler, the King of kings and Lord of lords. 
541Tm 6:16 He alone has endless life and lives in inaccessible light. No one has ever seen him, nor can anyone see him. Honor and eternal power belong to him! Amen. 
541Tm 6:17 Tell those who are rich in this age not to be arrogant and not to place their confidence in anything as uncertain as riches. Instead, let them place their confidence in God, who lavishly provides us with everything for our enjoyment.
541Tm 6:18 They are to do good, to be rich in good actions, to be generous, and to share.
541Tm 6:19 By doing this they store up a treasure for themselves that is a good foundation for the future, so that they can keep their hold on the life that is real. 
541Tm 6:20 Timothy, guard what has been entrusted to you. Avoid the pointless discussions and contradictions of what is falsely called knowledge.
541Tm 6:21 Although some claim to have it, they have abandoned the faith. May grace be with all of you!
55
552Tm 1:1 From£º Paul, an apostle of the Messiah Jesus by God's will in keeping with the promise of life that is in the Messiah Jesus.
552Tm 1:2 To£º Timothy, my dear child. May grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and the Messiah Jesus our Lord be yours! 
552Tm 1:3 I constantly thank my God - whom I serve with a clear conscience, as my ancestors did - when I remember you in my prayers night and day,
552Tm 1:4 recalling your tears and longing to see you so that I can be filled with joy.
552Tm 1:5 I am reminded of your sincere faith, which first existed in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice, and I am convinced that this faith also exists in you.
552Tm 1:6 For this reason, I am reminding you to fan into flames the gift of God that is within you through the laying on of my hands.
552Tm 1:7 For God did not give us a spirit of timidity but one of power, love, and self-discipline.
552Tm 1:8 Therefore, never be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord or of me, his prisoner. Instead, by God's power, join me in suffering for the sake of the gospel. 
552Tm 1:9 He saved us and called us with a holy calling, not according to our own accomplishments, but according to his own purpose and the grace that was given to us in the Messiah Jesus before time began.
552Tm 1:10 Now, however, that grace has been revealed through the coming of our Savior the Messiah Jesus, who has destroyed death and through the gospel has brought life and release from death into full view.
552Tm 1:11 For the sake of this gospel I was appointed to be a preacher, an apostle, and a teacher of the gentiles.
552Tm 1:12 That is why I suffer as I do. However, I am not ashamed, for I know the one in whom I have put my trust, and I'm convinced that he is able to protect what he has entrusted to me until the day that he comes.
552Tm 1:13 Hold on to the pattern of healthy teachings that you have heard from me, along with the faith and love that are in the Messiah Jesus.
552Tm 1:14 With the help of the Holy Spirit who lives in us, protect the good treasure that has been entrusted to you.1
552Tm 1:15 You know that everyone in Asia has abandoned me, including Phygelus and Hermogenes.
552Tm 1:16 May the Lord grant mercy to the family of Onesiphorus, for he often took care of me and was not ashamed that I was a prisoner.
552Tm 1:17 Instead, when he arrived in Rome he searched diligently for me and found me.
552Tm 1:18 May the Lord grant that he finds mercy on the day he comes again. You know very well how much he assisted me in Ephesus. 
552Tm 2:1 As for you, my child, be strong by the grace that is in the Messiah Jesus.
552Tm 2:2 What you have heard from me through many witnesses entrust to faithful people who will be able to teach others as well.
552Tm 2:3 Join me in suffering like a good soldier of the Messiah Jesus.
552Tm 2:4 No one serving in the military gets mixed up in civilian matters, for his aim is to please his commanding officer.
552Tm 2:5 Moreover, no one who is an athlete wins a prize unless he competes according to the rules.
552Tm 2:6 Furthermore, it is the hard working farmer who should have the first share of the crops.
552Tm 2:7 Think about what I am saying. The Lord will help you to understand all these things.
552Tm 2:8 Meditate on Jesus, the Messiah, who was raised from the dead and is a descendant of David. This is the gospel I tell others.
552Tm 2:9 Because of it I am experiencing trouble, even to the point of being chained like a criminal. However, God's word is not chained.
552Tm 2:10 For that reason, I endure everything for the sake of those who have been chosen so that they, too, may receive the salvation that is in the Messiah Jesus, along with eternal glory.
552Tm 2:11 This saying is trustworthy£º true life we gain.
552Tm 2:12 Enduring, we with him shall reign. Who him denies, he will disclaim.
552Tm 2:13 Our faith may fail, his never wanes? That's who he is, he cannot change!
552Tm 2:14 Remind others about these things, and warn them before God not to argue over words. Arguing does not do any good but only destroys those who are listening.
552Tm 2:15 Do your best to present yourself to God as an approved worker who has nothing to be ashamed of, handling the word of truth with precision.
552Tm 2:16 However, avoid pointless discussions. For people will become more and more ungodly,
552Tm 2:17 and what they say will spread everywhere like gangrene. Hymenaeus and Philetus are like that.
552Tm 2:18 They have abandoned the truth by claiming that the resurrection has already taken place, and so they destroy the faith of others. 
552Tm 2:19 However, God's solid foundation still stands. It has this inscription on it£º "The Lord knows those who belong to him," and "Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord must turn away from evil."
552Tm 2:20 In a large house there are not only utensils made of gold and silver, but also those made of wood and clay. Some are for special use, while others are for ordinary use.
552Tm 2:21 Therefore, if anyone stops associating with these people, he will become a special utensil, set apart for the owner's use, prepared for every good action. 
552Tm 2:22 Flee from youthful passions. Instead, pursue righteousness, faithfulness, love, and peace together with those who call on the Lord with a pure heart.
552Tm 2:23 Do not have anything to do with foolish and stupid discussions, because you know they breed arguments.
552Tm 2:24 A servant of the Lord must not argue. Instead, he must be kind to everyone, teachable, willing to suffer wrong,
552Tm 2:25 and gentle when refuting opponents. After all, maybe God will allow them to repent and to come to a full knowledge of the truth,
552Tm 2:26 so that they might escape from the devil's snare, even though they've been held captive by him to do his will.224
552Tm 3:1 You must realize, however, that in the last days difficult times will come.
552Tm 3:2 People will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boastful, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,
552Tm 3:3 unfeeling, uncooperative, slanderous, degenerate, brutal, hateful of what is good,
552Tm 3:4 traitors, reckless, conceited, and lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God.
552Tm 3:5 They will hold to an outward form of godliness but deny its power. Stay away from such people.
552Tm 3:6 For some of these men go into homes and deceive foolish women who are burdened with sins and swayed by all kinds of desires.
552Tm 3:7 These women are always studying but are never able to arrive at a full knowledge of the truth.
552Tm 3:8 Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men oppose the truth. They are depraved in mind and their faith is a counterfeit.
552Tm 3:9 But they will not get very far because, as in the case of those two men, their stupidity will be plain to everyone.8
552Tm 3:10 But you have observed my teaching, my way of life, my purpose, my faith, my patience, my love, my endurance,
552Tm 3:11 and how I was persecuted and suffered in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra. What persecutions I endured! Yet the Lord rescued me from all of them.
552Tm 3:12 Indeed, all who want to live a godly life in union with the Messiah Jesus will be persecuted.
552Tm 3:13 But evil people and impostors will go from bad to worse as they deceive others and are themselves deceived.310
552Tm 3:14 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and found to be true, because you know from whom you learned it.
552Tm 3:15 From infancy you have known the Holy Scriptures that are able to give you the wisdom you need for salvation through faith in the Messiah Jesus.
552Tm 3:16 All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
552Tm 3:17 so that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good action. 
552Tm 4:1 In the presence of God and the Messiah Jesus, who is going to judge those who are living and those who are dead, and in view of his appearing and his kingdom, I solemnly appeal to you
552Tm 4:2 to proclaim the message. Be ready to do this whether or not the time is convenient. Refute, warn, and encourage with the utmost patience when you teach.
552Tm 4:3 For the time will come when people will not tolerate healthy doctrine, but with itching ears will surround themselves with teachers who cater to their people's own desires.
552Tm 4:4 They will refuse to listen to the truth and will turn to myths.
552Tm 4:5 But you must be clear-headed about everything. Endure suffering. Do the work of an evangelist. Devote yourself completely to your ministry.
552Tm 4:6 I am already being poured out as an offering, and the time for my departure has come.
552Tm 4:7 I have fought the good fight. I have completed the race. I have kept the faith.
552Tm 4:8 The victor's crown of righteousness is now waiting for me, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will give to me on the day that he comes, and not only to me but also to all who eagerly wait for his appearing. 
552Tm 4:9 Do your best to come to me soon,
552Tm 4:10 because Demas, having fallen in love with this present world, has abandoned me and has gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, and Titus to Dalmatia.
552Tm 4:11 Only Luke is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is useful in my ministry.
552Tm 4:12 I have sent Tychicus to Ephesus. 
552Tm 4:13 When you come, bring the coat I left with Carpus in Troas, as well as the scrolls and especially the parchments.
552Tm 4:14 Alexander the metalworker did me a great deal of harm. The Lord will pay him back for what he did.
552Tm 4:15 You, too, must watch out for him, for he violently opposed our message.
552Tm 4:16 At my first trial no one came to my defense. Everyone abandoned me. May it not be held against them!
552Tm 4:17 However, the Lord stood by me and gave me strength so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the gentiles could hear it. I was rescued out of a lion's mouth.
552Tm 4:18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil attack and will take me safely to his heavenly kingdom. Glory belongs to him forever and ever! Amen.
552Tm 4:19 Greet Prisca and Aquila and the family of Onesiphorus.
552Tm 4:20 Erastus stayed in Corinth, and I left Trophimus in Miletus because he was sick.
552Tm 4:21 Do your best to come to me before winter. Eubulus sends you greetings, as do Pudens, Linus, Claudia, and all the brothers. 
552Tm 4:22 May the Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with all of you! Amen.

56Ti 1:1 From£º Paul, a servant of God, and also an apostle of Jesus the Messiah, to bring the faith to those chosen by God, along with full knowledge of the truth that leads to godliness,
56Ti 1:2 which is based on the hope of eternal life that God, who cannot lie, promised before the world began.
56Ti 1:3 At the right time he revealed his message through the proclamation that was entrusted to me by the command of God our Savior.
56Ti 1:4 To£º Titus, a genuine child in the faith that we share. May grace and peace from God the Father and the Messiah, Jesus our Savior, be yours! 
56Ti 1:5 The reason I left you in Crete was to complete what still needed to be done and to appoint elders in every city, as I myself commanded you.
56Ti 1:6 An elder must be blameless. He must be the husband of one wife and have children who are believers and who are not accused of having wild lifestyles or of being rebellious.
56Ti 1:7 Because an overseer is God's servant manager, he must be blameless. He must not be arrogant or irritable. He must not drink too much, be a violent person, or make money in shameful ways.
56Ti 1:8 Instead, he must be hospitable to strangers, must appreciate what is good, and be sensible, honest, moral, and self-controlled.
56Ti 1:9 He must be devoted to the trustworthy message that agrees with what we teach, so that he may be able to encourage others with healthy doctrine and refute those who oppose it. 
56Ti 1:10 For there are many people who are rebellious, especially those who are converts from Judaism. They speak utter nonsense and deceive people.
56Ti 1:11 They must be silenced, because they are the kind of people who ruin whole families by teaching what they should not teach in order to make money in a shameful way.
56Ti 1:12 One of their very own prophets said, savage brutes that live to eat."
56Ti 1:13 That statement is true. For this reason, refute them sharply so that they may become healthy in the faith
56Ti 1:14 and not pay attention to Jewish myths or commands given by people who reject the truth.
56Ti 1:15 Everything is clean to those who are clean, but nothing is clean to those who are corrupt and unbelieving. Indeed, their very way of thinking and their consciences have been corrupted.
56Ti 1:16 They claim to know God, but they deny him by their actions. They are detestable, disobedient, and disqualified to do anything good.114
56Ti 2:1 But as for you, teach what is consistent with healthy doctrine.
56Ti 2:2 Older men are to be sober, serious, sensible, and sound in faith, love, and endurance.
56Ti 2:3 Likewise, older women are to show their reverence for God by their behavior. They are not to be gossips or addicted to alcohol, but to be examples of goodness.
56Ti 2:4 They should encourage the younger women to love their husbands, to love their children,
56Ti 2:5 to be sensible and pure, to manage their households, to be kind, and to submit themselves to their husbands. Otherwise, the word of God may be discredited.
56Ti 2:6 Likewise, encourage the younger men to be sensible.
56Ti 2:7 Always set an example for others by doing good actions. Teach with integrity and dignity.
56Ti 2:8 Use wholesome speech that cannot be condemned. Then any opponent will be ashamed because he cannot say anything bad about us. 
56Ti 2:9 Slaves are to submit to their masters in everything, aiming to please them and not argue with them
56Ti 2:10 or steal from them. Instead, they are to show complete and perfect loyalty, so that in every way they may make the teaching about God our Savior more attractive. 
56Ti 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all people.
56Ti 2:12 It trains us to renounce ungodly living and worldly passions so that we might live sensible, honest, and godly lives in the present age
56Ti 2:13 as we wait for the blessed hope and glorious appearance of our great God and Savior, Jesus the Messiah.
56Ti 2:14 He gave himself for us to set us free from every wrong and to cleanse us so that we could be his special people who are enthusiastic about doing good deeds.2
56Ti 2:15 These are the things you should teach. Encourage and refute with full authority. Do not let anyone look down on you. 
56Ti 3:1 Remind believers to submit to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, and to be ready to do any honorable kind of work.
56Ti 3:2 They are not to insult anyone or be argumentative. Instead, they are to be gentle and perfectly courteous to everyone.
56Ti 3:3 After all, we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, and misled. We were slaves to many kinds of lusts and pleasures, spending our days in malice and jealousy. We were despised, and we hated one another. 
56Ti 3:4 In grace our Savior God appeared, to make his love for mankind clear.
56Ti 3:5 'Twas not for deeds that we had done, but by his steadfast love alone, he saved us through a second birth, renewed us by the Spirit's work,
56Ti 3:6 and poured him out upon us, too, through Jesus the Messiah our Savior true.
56Ti 3:7 And so, made heirs by his own grace, eternal life we now embrace.
56Ti 3:8 This saying is trustworthy. I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have put their faith in God may devote themselves to good actions. These things are good and helpful to other people. 
56Ti 3:9 But avoid foolish controversies, arguments about genealogies, quarrels, and fights about the law. These things are useless and worthless.
56Ti 3:10 Have nothing to do with a divisive person after you have warned him once or twice.
56Ti 3:11 For you know that a person like this is corrupt and keeps on sinning, being self-condemned.10
56Ti 3:12 As soon as I send Artemas to you, or perhaps Tychicus, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
56Ti 3:13 Do all you can to send Zenas the expert in the law and Apollos on their way, and see that they have everything they need.
56Ti 3:14 Our own people should also learn to make good deeds a priority when urgent needs arise, so they won't be unproductive. 
56Ti 3:15 All who are with me send you greetings. Greet our fellow believers who love us. May grace be with all of you! Amen.

57Phm 1:1 From£º Paul, a prisoner of the Messiah Jesus, and Timothy our brother. To£º Philemon our dear friend and fellow worker,
57Phm 1:2 to Apphia our sister, to Archippus our fellow soldier, and to the church in your house.
57Phm 1:3 May grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be yours!
57Phm 1:4 I always thank my God when I mention you in my prayers,
57Phm 1:5 because I keep hearing about your love for all the saints and the faith that you have in the Lord Jesus.
57Phm 1:6 I pray that your partnership in the faith may become effective as you fully acknowledge every blessing that is ours in the Messiah.
57Phm 1:7 For I have received considerable joy and encouragement from your love, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed, brother, through you. 
57Phm 1:8 For this reason, although in the Messiah I have complete freedom to order you to do what is proper,
57Phm 1:9 I prefer to make my appeal on the basis of love. I, Paul, as an old man and now a prisoner of the Messiah Jesus,
57Phm 1:10 appeal to you on behalf of my child Onesimus, whose father I have become during my imprisonment.
57Phm 1:11 Once he was useless to you, but now he is very useful both to you and to me.
57Phm 1:12 As I send him back, it's like I'm coming along with him.
57Phm 1:13 I wanted to keep him with me so that he could serve me in your place during my imprisonment for the gospel.
57Phm 1:14 Yet I did not want to do anything without your consent, so that your good deed might not be something forced, but voluntary.
57Phm 1:15 Perhaps this is why he was separated from you for a while, so that you could have him back forever,
57Phm 1:16 no longer as a slave but better than a slave - as a dear brother, especially to me, but even more so to you, both as a person and as a believer.
57Phm 1:17 So if you consider me a partner, welcome him as you would welcome me.
57Phm 1:18 If he has wronged you in any way or owes you anything, charge it to my account.
57Phm 1:19 I, Paul, am writing this with my own hand£º I will repay it. (I will not mention to you that you owe me your very life.)
57Phm 1:20 Yes, brother, I desire this favor from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in the Messiah!
57Phm 1:21 Confident of your obedience, I am writing to you because I know that you will do even more than I ask.
57Phm 1:22 Meanwhile, prepare a guest room for me, too, for I am hoping through your prayers to be returned to you.
57Phm 1:23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in the Messiah Jesus, sends you greetings,
57Phm 1:24 as do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
57Phm 1:25 May the grace of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be with your spirit! Amen.

58Heb 1:1 God, having spoken in former times in fragmentary and varied fashion to our forefathers by the prophets,
58Heb 1:2 has in these last days spoken to us by a Son whom he appointed to be the heir of everything and through whom he also made the universe.
58Heb 1:3 He is the reflection of God's glory and the exact likeness of his being, and he holds everything together by his powerful word. After he had provided a cleansing from sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Highest Majesty
58Heb 1:4 and became as much superior to the angels as the name he has inherited is better than theirs. 
58Heb 1:5 For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son. Today I have become your Father"? Or again, "I will be his Father, and he will be my Son" - 
58Heb 1:6 And again, when he brings his firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him."
58Heb 1:7 Now about the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, and his servants flames of fire."
58Heb 1:8 But about the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of your kingdom is a righteous scepter.
58Heb 1:9 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness. That is why God, your God, anointed you rather than your companions with the oil of gladness."1
58Heb 1:10 And,1 "In the beginning, Lord, you laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the work of your hands.
58Heb 1:11 They will come to an end, but you will remain forever. They will all wear out like clothes.
58Heb 1:12 You will roll them up like a robe, and they will be changed like clothes. But you remain the same, and your life will never end."
58Heb 1:13 But to which of the angels did he ever say, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet" - 1
58Heb 1:14 All of them are spirits on a divine mission, sent to serve those who are about to inherit salvation, aren't they? 
58Heb 2:1 For this reason we must pay closer attention to the things we have heard, or we may drift away,
58Heb 2:2 because if the message spoken by angels was reliable, and every violation and act of disobedience received its just punishment,
58Heb 2:3 how will we escape if we neglect a salvation as great as this? It was first proclaimed by the Lord himself, and then it was confirmed to us by those who heard him,
58Heb 2:4 while God added his testimony through signs, wonders, various miracles, and gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will. 
58Heb 2:5 For he did not put the coming world we are talking about under the control of angels.
58Heb 2:6 Instead, someone has declared somewhere, "What is man that you should remember him, or the son of man that you should care for him - 
58Heb 2:7 You made him a little lower than the angels, yet you crowned him with glory and honor
58Heb 2:8 and put everything under his feet." Now when God put everything under him, he left nothing outside his control. However, at the present time we do not yet see everything put under him.
58Heb 2:9 But we do see someone who was made a little lower than the angels. He is Jesus, who is crowned with glory and honor because he suffered death, so that by the grace of God he might experience death for everyone. 
58Heb 2:10 It was fitting that God, for whom and through whom everything exists, should make the pioneer of their salvation perfect through suffering as part of his plan to glorify many children,
58Heb 2:11 because both the one who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified all have the same Father. That is why Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers
58Heb 2:12 when he says, "I will announce your name to my brothers. I will praise you within the congregation."
58Heb 2:13 And again, "I will trust him." And again, "I am here with the children God has given me."
58Heb 2:14 Therefore, since the children have flesh and blood, he himself also shared the same things, so that by his death he might destroy the one who has the power of death (that is, the devil)
58Heb 2:15 and might free those who were slaves all their lives because they were terrified by death.
58Heb 2:16 For it is clear that he did not come to help angels. No, he came to help Abraham's descendants,
58Heb 2:17 thereby becoming like his brothers in every way, so that he could be a merciful and faithful high priest in service to God and could atone for the people's sins.
58Heb 2:18 Because he himself suffered when he was tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted. 
58Heb 3:1 Therefore, holy brothers, partners in a heavenly calling, keep your focus on Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession.
58Heb 3:2 He was faithful to the one who appointed him, just as Moses was in all God's household,
58Heb 3:3 because he is worthy of greater glory than Moses in the same way that the builder of a house has greater honor than the house itself.
58Heb 3:4 After all, every house is built by someone, but God is the builder of everything.
58Heb 3:5 Moses was faithful in all God's household as a servant who was to testify to what would be said later,
58Heb 3:6 but the Messiah was faithful as the Son in charge of God's household, and we are his household if we hold on to our courage and the hope in which we rejoice.2
58Heb 3:7 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you hear his voice,
58Heb 3:8 do not harden your hearts as they did when they provoked me during the time of testing in the wilderness.
58Heb 3:9 There your ancestors tested me, even though they had seen my actions
58Heb 3:10 for40 years. That is why I was indignant with that generation and said, 'They are always going astray in their hearts, and they have not known my ways.'
58Heb 3:11 So in my anger I swore a solemn oath that they would never enter my rest."
58Heb 3:12 See to it, my brothers, that no evil, unbelieving heart is found in any of you, as shown by your turning away from the living God.
58Heb 3:13 Instead, continue to encourage one another every day, as long as it is called "Today," so that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin,
58Heb 3:14 because we are the Messiah's partners only if we hold on to our original confidence to the end.
58Heb 3:15 As it is said, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as they did when they provoked me."3
58Heb 3:16 Now who heard him and provoked him? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt led by Moses - 
58Heb 3:17 And with whom was he angry for40 years? Was it not with those who sinned and whose bodies fell dead in the wilderness - 
58Heb 3:18 And to whom did he swear that they would never enter his rest? It was to those who disobeyed him, was it not - 
58Heb 3:19 So we see that they were unable to enter because of their unbelief.3
58Heb 4:1 Therefore, as long as the promise of entering his rest remains valid, let us be afraid! Otherwise, some of you will fail to reach it,
58Heb 4:2 because we have had the good news told to us as well as to them. But the message they heard did not help them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened to it.
58Heb 4:3 We who have believed are entering that rest, just as he has said, "So in my anger I swore a solemn oath that they would never enter my rest," even though his actions had been finished since the creation of the world.
58Heb 4:4 Somewhere he has spoken about the seventh day as follows£º "On the seventh day God rested from all his actions,"
58Heb 4:5 and again in this passage, "They will never enter my rest."
58Heb 4:6 Therefore, since it is still true that some will enter it, and since those who once heard the good news failed to enter it because of their disobedience,
58Heb 4:7 he again fixes a definite day?"Today" - saying long afterward through David, as already quoted, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."
58Heb 4:8 For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken later about another day.
58Heb 4:9 There remains, therefore, a Sabbath rest for the people of God,
58Heb 4:10 because the one who enters God's rest has himself rested from his own actions, just as God did from his.
58Heb 4:11 Let us, therefore, make every effort to enter that rest, so that no one may fail by following their example of disobedience.
58Heb 4:12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any double-edged sword, piercing until it divides soul and spirit, joints and marrow, as it judges the thoughts and purposes of the heart.
58Heb 4:13 No creature can hide from him, but everyone is exposed and helpless before the eyes of the one to whom we must give a word of explanation.410
58Heb 4:14 Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has gone to heaven, Jesus the Son of God, let us live our lives consistent with our confession of faith.
58Heb 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses. Instead, we have one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet he never sinned.
58Heb 4:16 So let us keep on coming boldly to the throne of grace, so that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help us in our time of need. 
58Heb 5:1 For every high priest selected from among men is appointed to officiate on their behalf in matters relating to God, that is, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
58Heb 5:2 He can deal gently with people who are ignorant and easily deceived, since he himself is subject to weakness.
58Heb 5:3 For that reason he is obligated to offer sacrifices for his own sins as well as for those of the people.
58Heb 5:4 No one takes this honor upon himself but he is called to it by God, just as Aaron was. 
58Heb 5:5 In the same way, the Messiah did not take upon himself the glory of being a high priest. No, it was God who said to him, "You are my Son. Today I have become your Father."
58Heb 5:6 As he also says in another place, "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
58Heb 5:7 As a mortal man, he offered up prayers and appeals with loud cries and tears to the one who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his devotion to God.
58Heb 5:8 Son though he was, he learned obedience through his sufferings
58Heb 5:9 and, once made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation for all who obey him,
58Heb 5:10 having been designated by God to be a high priest according to the order of Melchizedek. 
58Heb 5:11 We have much to say about this, but it is difficult to explain because you have become too lazy to understand.
58Heb 5:12 In fact, though by now you should be teachers, you still need someone to teach you the basic truths of God's word. You have become people who need milk instead of solid food.
58Heb 5:13 For everyone who lives on milk is still a baby and does not yet know the difference between right and wrong.
58Heb 5:14 But solid food is for mature people, whose minds are trained by practice to distinguish good from evil. 
58Heb 6:1 Therefore, leaving behind the elementary teachings about the Messiah, let us continue to be carried along to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead actions, faith toward God,
58Heb 6:2 instruction about baptisms, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
58Heb 6:3 And this we will do, if God permits. 
58Heb 6:4 For it is impossible to keep on restoring to repentance time and again people who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, who have become partners with the Holy Spirit,
58Heb 6:5 who have tasted the goodness of God's word and the powers of the coming age,
58Heb 6:6 and who have fallen away, as long as they continue to crucify the Son of God to their own detriment by exposing him to public ridicule.
58Heb 6:7 For when the ground soaks up rain that often falls on it and continues producing vegetation useful to those for whom it is cultivated, it receives a blessing from God.
58Heb 6:8 However, if it continues to produce thorns and thistles, it is worthless and in danger of being cursed, and in the end will be burned.
58Heb 6:9 Even though we speak like this, dear friends, we are convinced of better things in your case, things that point to salvation.
58Heb 6:10 For God is not so unjust as to forget your work and the love you have shown him as you have ministered to the saints and continue to minister to them.
58Heb 6:11 But we want each of you to continue to be diligent to the very end, in order to give full assurance to your hope.
58Heb 6:12 Then, instead of being lazy, you will imitate those who are inheriting the promises through faith and patience.6
58Heb 6:13 For when God made his promise to Abraham, he swore an oath by himself, since he had no one greater to swear by.
58Heb 6:14 He said, "I will certainly bless you and give you many descendants."
58Heb 6:15 And so he obtained what he had been promised, because he patiently waited for it.
58Heb 6:16 For people swear by someone greater than themselves, and an oath given as confirmation puts an end to all argument.
58Heb 6:17 In the same way, when God wanted to make the unchangeable character of his purpose perfectly clear to the heirs of his promise, he guaranteed it with an oath,
58Heb 6:18 so that by these two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to prove false, we who have taken refuge in him might be encouraged to seize the hope set before us.
58Heb 6:19 That hope, firm and secure like an anchor for our souls, reaches behind the curtain
58Heb 6:20 where Jesus, our forerunner, has gone on our behalf, having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek. 
58Heb 7:1 Now this man Melchizedek, king of Salem and priest of the Most High God, met Abraham and blessed him when he was returning from defeating the kings.
58Heb 7:2 Abraham gave Melchizedek a tenth of everything. In the first place, his name means "king of righteousness," and then he is also king of Salem, that is, "king of peace."
58Heb 7:3 He has no father, mother, or genealogy, no birth date recorded for him, nor a date of death. Like the Son of God, he continues to be a priest forever.
58Heb 7:4 Just look at how great this man was! Even Abraham - the patriarch himself - gave him a tenth of what he had captured!
58Heb 7:5 The descendants of Levi who accept the priesthood have a commandment in the law to collect a tenth from the people, that is, from their own brothers, even though they are also descendants of Abraham.
58Heb 7:6 But this man, whose descent is not traced from them, collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the man who had received the promises.
58Heb 7:7 It is beyond dispute that the less important person is blessed by the more important person.
58Heb 7:8 Mortal men collect tithes, but we are informed by Scripture that Melchizedek keeps on living.
58Heb 7:9 One might even say that Levi, who collects the tenth, paid the tenth through Abraham,
58Heb 7:10 because Levi was still inside his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.
58Heb 7:11 Now if perfection could have been attained through the Levitical priesthood - for on this basis the people received the law - what further need would there be to speak of appointing another kind of priest according to the order of Melchizedek, not one according to the order of Aaron - 
58Heb 7:12 When a change in the priesthood takes place, there must also be a change in the law.
58Heb 7:13 For the person we are talking about belonged to a different tribe, and no one from that tribe has ever served at the altar.
58Heb 7:14 Furthermore, it is obvious that our Lord was a descendant of Judah, and Moses said nothing about priests coming from that tribe.
58Heb 7:15 This point is even more obvious in that another priest who is like Melchizedek has appeared
58Heb 7:16 who was appointed to be a priest, not on the basis of a genealogical registry, but rather on the power of an indestructible life.
58Heb 7:17 For it is declared about him, "You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
58Heb 7:18 Indeed, because it was weak and ineffective, the former commandment has been annulled,
58Heb 7:19 since the law made nothing perfect, and a better hope is presented, by which we approach God.
58Heb 7:20 Now none of this happened without an oath. Others became priests without any oath,
58Heb 7:21 but Jesus became a priest with an oath when God said to him, "The Lord has taken an oath and will not change his mind. You are a priest forever."
58Heb 7:22 In this way, Jesus has become the guarantor of a better covenant. 
58Heb 7:23 There have been many priests, since each one of them had to stop serving in office when he died.
58Heb 7:24 But because Jesus lives forever, he has a permanent priesthood.
58Heb 7:25 Therefore, because he always lives to intercede for them, he is able to save completely those who come to God through him. 
58Heb 7:26 We need such a high priest - one who is holy, innocent, pure, set apart from sinners, exalted above the heavens.
58Heb 7:27 He has no need to offer sacrifices every day like high priests do, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he sacrificed himself.
58Heb 7:28 For the law appoints as high priests men who are weak, but the promised oath, which came after the law, results in a Son who is eternally perfect. 
58Heb 8:1 Now the main point in what we are saying is this£º we do have this kind of high priest, who sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven
58Heb 8:2 and who serves in the sanctuary, the true tabernacle set up by the Lord and not by any human.
58Heb 8:3 For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore, this high priest had to offer something, too.
58Heb 8:4 Now if he were on earth, he would not even be a priest, because other men offer the gifts prescribed by the law.
58Heb 8:5 They serve in a sanctuary that is a copy, a shadow of the heavenly one. This is why Moses was warned when he was about to build the tabernacle£º "See to it that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain."
58Heb 8:6 However, Jesus has now obtained a more superior ministry, since the covenant he mediates is founded on better promises. 
58Heb 8:7 If the first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no need to look for a second one,
58Heb 8:8 but God found something wrong with his people when he said, "Look! The days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. 
58Heb 8:9 It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors at the time when I took them by the hand and brought them out of the land of Egypt. Because they did not remain loyal to my covenant, I ignored them, declares the Lord.
58Heb 8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after that time, declares the Lord£º I will put my laws in their minds and write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people.
58Heb 8:11 Never again will everyone teach his neighbor or his brother by saying, 'Know the Lord,' because all of them will know me, from the least important to the most important.
58Heb 8:12 For I will be merciful regarding their wrong deeds, and I will never again remember their sins."
58Heb 8:13 In speaking of a "new" covenant, he has made the first one obsolete, and what is obsolete and aging will soon disappear. 
58Heb 9:1 Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary.
58Heb 9:2 For a tabernacle was set up, and in the first part were the lamp stand, the table, and the bread of the Presence. This was called the Holy Place.
58Heb 9:3 Behind the second curtain was the part of the tabernacle called the Holy of Holies,
58Heb 9:4 which had the gold altar for incense and the ark of the covenant completely covered with gold. In it were the gold jar holding the manna, Aaron's staff that had budded, and the tablets of the covenant.
58Heb 9:5 Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the place of atonement. (We cannot discuss these things in detail now.)2
58Heb 9:6 When everything had been arranged like this, the priests always went into the first part of the tabernacle to perform their duties.
58Heb 9:7 But only the high priest went into the second part, and then only once a year, and never without blood, which he offered for himself and for the sins committed by the people in ignorance.
58Heb 9:8 The Holy Spirit was indicating by this that the way into the Holy of Holies had not yet been disclosed as long as the first part of the tabernacle was still standing.
58Heb 9:9 This illustration for today indicates that the gifts and sacrifices being offered could not clear the conscience of a worshiper,
58Heb 9:10 since they deal only with food, drink, and various washings, which are required for the body until the time when things would be set right. 
58Heb 9:11 But when the Messiah came as a high priest of the good things that have come, he went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that was not made by human hands and that is not a part of this creation.
58Heb 9:12 Not with the blood of goats and calves, but with his own blood he went into the Holy of Holies once for all and secured our eternal redemption.
58Heb 9:13 For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a heifer sprinkled on those who are unclean purifies them physically,
58Heb 9:14 how much more will the blood of the Messiah, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our consciences from dead actions so that we may serve the living God! 
58Heb 9:15 This is why the Messiah is the mediator of a new covenant; so that those who are called may receive the eternal inheritance promised them, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the offenses committed under the first covenant.
58Heb 9:16 For where there is a will, the death of the one who made it must be established.
58Heb 9:17 For a will is in force only when somebody has died, since it never takes effect as long as the one who made it is alive.
58Heb 9:18 This is why even the first covenant was not put into effect without blood.
58Heb 9:19 For after every commandment in the law had been spoken to all the people by Moses, he took the blood of calves and goats, together with some water, scarlet wool, and branches of hyssop, and sprinkled the scroll and all the people,
58Heb 9:20 saying, "This is the blood of the covenant that God ordained for you."
58Heb 9:21 In the same way, he sprinkled with the blood both the tabernacle and everything used in worship.
58Heb 9:22 In fact, under the law almost everything is cleansed with blood, and without the shedding of the blood there is no forgiveness. 
58Heb 9:23 Thus it was necessary for these earthly copies of the things in heaven to be cleansed by these sacrifices, but the heavenly things themselves are made clean with better sacrifices than these.
58Heb 9:24 For the Messiah did not go into a sanctuary made by human hands that is merely a copy of the true one, but into heaven itself, to appear now in God's presence on our behalf.
58Heb 9:25 Nor did he go into heaven to sacrifice himself again and again, the way the high priest goes into the Holy Place every year with blood that is not his own.
58Heb 9:26 Then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the creation of the world. But now, at the end of the ages, he has appeared once for all to remove sin by his sacrifice.
58Heb 9:27 Indeed, just as people are destined to die once and after that to be judged,
58Heb 9:28 so the Messiah was sacrificed once to take away the sins of many people. And he will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but to bring salvation to those who eagerly wait for him.
58Heb 10:1 For the Law, being only a reflection of the blessings to come and not their substance, can never make perfect those who come near by the same sacrifices repeatedly offered year after year.
58Heb 10:2 Otherwise, would they not have stopped offering them, because the worshipers, cleansed once for all, would no longer be aware of any sins - 
58Heb 10:3 Instead, through those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year,
58Heb 10:4 for it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.1 
58Heb 10:5 For this reason, the Scriptures say, when the Messiah was about to come into the world£º "You did not want sacrifices and offerings, but you prepared a body for me.
58Heb 10:6 In burnt offerings and sin offerings you never took delight.
58Heb 10:7 Then I said, 'See, I have come to do your will, O God' In the volume of the scroll this is written about me."
58Heb 10:8 In this passage he says, "You never wanted or took delight in sacrifices, offerings, burnt offerings, and sin offerings," which are offered according to the law.
58Heb 10:9 Then he says, "See, I have come to do your will." He takes away the first in order to establish the second.
58Heb 10:10 By God's will we have been sanctified once and for all through the sacrifice of the body of Jesus, the Messiah. 
58Heb 10:11 Day after day every priest stands and repeatedly offers the same sacrifices that can never take away sins.
58Heb 10:12 But when this priest had offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, "he sat down at the right hand of God."
58Heb 10:13 Since that time, he has been waiting for his enemies to be made a footstool for his feet.
58Heb 10:14 For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified. 
58Heb 10:15 The Holy Spirit also assures us of this, for he said£º
58Heb 10:16 "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, declares the Lord£º I will put my laws in their hearts and will write them on their minds,
58Heb 10:17 and I will never again remember their sins and their lawless deeds."
58Heb 10:18 Now where there is forgiveness of these sins, there is no longer any offering for sin.
58Heb 10:19 Therefore, my brothers, since we have confidence to enter the sanctuary by the blood of Jesus,
58Heb 10:20 the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain (that is, through his flesh),
58Heb 10:21 and since we have a great high priest over the household of God,
58Heb 10:22 let us continue to come near with sincere hearts in the full assurance that faith provides, because our hearts have been sprinkled clean from a guilty conscience, and our bodies have been washed with pure water.
58Heb 10:23 Let us continue to hold firmly to the hope that we confess without wavering, for the one who made the promise is faithful.
58Heb 10:24 And let us continue to consider how to motivate one another to love and good deeds,
58Heb 10:25 not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another even more as you see the day of the Lord coming nearer.
58Heb 10:26 For if we choose to go on sinning after we have learned the full truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
58Heb 10:27 but only a terrifying prospect of judgment and a raging fire that will consume the enemies of God.
58Heb 10:28 Anyone who violates the law of Moses dies without mercy "on the testimony of two or three witnesses."
58Heb 10:29 How much more severe a punishment do you think that person deserves who tramples on God's Son, treats as common the blood of the covenant by which it was sanctified, and insults the Spirit of grace - 
58Heb 10:30 For we know the one who said, "Vengeance belongs to me; I will pay them back," and again, "The Lord will judge his people."
58Heb 10:31 It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God!30
58Heb 10:32 But you must continue to remember those earlier days, how after you were enlightened you endured a hard and painful struggle.
58Heb 10:33 At times you were made a public spectacle by means of insults and persecutions, while at other times you associated with people who were treated this way.
58Heb 10:34 For you sympathized with the prisoners and cheerfully submitted to the violent seizure of your property, because you know that you have a better and more permanent possession.
58Heb 10:35 So don't lose your confidence, since it holds a great reward for you.
58Heb 10:36 For you need endurance, so that after you have done God's will you can receive what he has promised.
58Heb 10:37 For "in a very little while the one who is coming will return? he will not delay;
58Heb 10:38 but my righteous one will live by faith, and if he turns back, my soul will take no pleasure in him."
58Heb 10:39 Now, we do not belong to those who turn back and are destroyed, but to those who have faith and are saved. 
58Heb 11:1 Now faith is the assurance that what we hope for will come about and the certainty that what we cannot see exists.
58Heb 11:2 By faith our ancestors won approval.
58Heb 11:3 By faith we understand that time was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was made from things that are invisible. 
58Heb 11:4 By faith Abel offered to God a better sacrifice than Cain did, and by faith he was declared to be righteous, since God himself accepted his offerings. And by faith he continues to speak, even though he is dead. 
58Heb 11:5 By faith Enoch was taken away without experiencing death. He could not be found, because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he won approval as one who pleased God.
58Heb 11:6 Now without faith it is impossible to please God, for whoever comes to him must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who diligently search for him.
58Heb 11:7 By faith Noah, when warned about things not yet seen, reverently prepared an ark to save his family, and by faith he condemned the world and inherited the righteousness that comes by faith. 
58Heb 11:8 By faith Abraham, when called to go to a place he would later receive as his inheritance, obeyed and went, even though he did not know where he was going. 
58Heb 11:9 By faith he made his home in the promised land like a stranger, living in tents, as did Isaac and Jacob, who also inherited the same promise,
58Heb 11:10 because he was waiting for the city with permanent foundations, whose architect and builder is God. 
58Heb 11:11 By faith Sarah, even though she was old and barren, received the strength to conceive, because she was convinced that the one who had made the promise was faithful.
58Heb 11:12 Abraham was as good as dead, yet from this one man came descendants as numerous as the stars in the sky and as countless as the sand on the seashore. 
58Heb 11:13 All these people died having faith. They did not receive the things that were promised, yet they saw them in the distant future and welcomed them, acknowledging that they were strangers and foreigners on earth.
58Heb 11:14 For people who say such things make it clear that they are looking for a country of their own.
58Heb 11:15 If they had been thinking about what they had left behind, they would have had an opportunity to go back.
58Heb 11:16 Instead, they were longing for a better country, that is, a heavenly one. That is why God is not ashamed to be called their God, because he has prepared a city for them. 
58Heb 11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered Isaac - he who had received the promises was about to offer his unique son in sacrifice,
58Heb 11:18 about whom it had been said, "It is through Isaac that descendants will be named for you."
58Heb 11:19 Abraham was certain that God could raise the dead, and figuratively speaking, he did get Isaac back in this way. 
58Heb 11:20 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau in regard to their future. 
58Heb 11:21 By faith Jacob, when he was dying, blessed each of Joseph's sons "and worshiped while leaning on the top of his staff." 
58Heb 11:22 By faith Joseph, when his end was near, spoke about the exodus of the Israelites and gave them instructions about burying his bones. 
58Heb 11:23 By faith Moses was hidden by his parents for three months after he was born, because they saw that he was a beautiful child and were not afraid of the king's order. 
58Heb 11:24 By faith Moses, when he had grown up, refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter,
58Heb 11:25 because he preferred being mistreated with God's people to enjoying the pleasures of sin for a short time.
58Heb 11:26 He thought that being insulted for the sake of the Messiah was of greater value than the treasures of Egypt, because he was looking ahead to his reward. 
58Heb 11:27 By faith he left Egypt, without being afraid of the king's anger, and he persevered because he saw the one who is invisible. 
58Heb 11:28 By faith he established the Passover and the sprinkling of blood to keep the destroyer of the firstborn from touching the people.
58Heb 11:29 By faith they went through the Red Sea as if it were dry land. When the Egyptians tried to do this, they were drowned. 
58Heb 11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days. 
58Heb 11:31 By faith Rahab the prostitute did not die with those who were disobedient, because she had welcomed the spies with a greeting of peace. 
58Heb 11:32 And what more should I say? For time would fail me to tell you about Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, David, Samuel, and the prophets.
58Heb 11:33 Through faith they conquered kingdoms, administered justice, received promises, shut the mouths of lions,
58Heb 11:34 put out raging fires, escaped death by the sword, found strength in weakness, became powerful in battle, and routed foreign armies.
58Heb 11:35 Women received their dead raised back to life. Other people were brutally tortured, but refused to be ransomed, so that they might gain a better resurrection.
58Heb 11:36 Still others endured taunts and floggings, and even chains and imprisonment.
58Heb 11:37 They were stoned to death, sawed in half, and killed with swords. They went around in sheepskins and goatskins. They were needy, oppressed, and mistreated.
58Heb 11:38 The world wasn't worthy of them. They wandered in deserts and mountains, and from caves to holes in the ground. 
58Heb 11:39 All these people won approval for their faith but they did not receive what was promised,
58Heb 11:40 since God had planned something better for us, so that they would not be perfected without us. 
58Heb 12:1 Therefore, having so vast a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, and throwing off everything that hinders us and especially the sin that so easily entangles us, let us keep running with endurance the race set before us,
58Heb 12:2 fixing our attention on Jesus, the pioneer and perfecter of the faith, who, in view of the joy set before him, endured the cross, disregarding its shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God. 
58Heb 12:3 Think about the one who endured such hostility from sinners, so that you may not become tired and give up.
58Heb 12:4 In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
58Heb 12:5 You have forgotten the encouragement that is addressed to you as sons£º "My son, do not think lightly of the Lord's discipline or give up when you are corrected by him.
58Heb 12:6 For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and he punishes every son he accepts."
58Heb 12:7 What you endure disciplines you£º God is treating you as sons. Is there a son whom his father does not discipline - 
58Heb 12:8 Now if you are without any discipline, in which all sons share, then you are illegitimate and not God's sons.
58Heb 12:9 Furthermore, we had earthly fathers who disciplined us, and we respected them for it. We should submit even more to the Father of our spirits and live, shouldn't we - 
58Heb 12:10 For a short time they disciplined us as they thought best, but God does it for our good, so that we may share in his holiness.
58Heb 12:11 No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, for those who have been trained by it, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace.8
58Heb 12:12 Therefore, strengthen your tired arms and your weak knees,
58Heb 12:13 and straighten the paths of your life, so that your lameness may not become worse, but instead may be healed. 
58Heb 12:14 Pursue peace with everyone, as well as holiness, without which no one will see the Lord.
58Heb 12:15 See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God and that no bitter root grows up and causes you trouble, or many of you will become defiled.
58Heb 12:16 No one should be immoral or godless like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
58Heb 12:17 For you know that afterwards, when he wanted to inherit the blessing, he was rejected because he could not find any opportunity to repent, even though he begged to repent with tears.
58Heb 12:18 You have not come to something that can be touched, to a blazing fire, to darkness, to gloom,
58Heb 12:19 to a trumpet's blast, or to a voice that made the hearers beg that not another word be spoken to them.
58Heb 12:20 For they could not endure the command that was given£º "If even an animal touches the mountain, it must be stoned to death."
58Heb 12:21 Indeed, the sight was so terrifying that Moses said, "I am trembling with fear."
58Heb 12:22 Instead, you have come to Mount Zion, to the city of the living God, to the heavenly Jerusalem, to tens of thousands of angels joyfully gathered together,
58Heb 12:23 to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, to a judge who is the God of all, to the spirits of righteous people who have been made perfect,
58Heb 12:24 to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better message than Abel's.
58Heb 12:25 See to it that you do not ignore the one who is speaking. For if the hearers did not escape when they ignored the one who warned them on earth, how much less will we escape if we turn away from the one who is from heaven!
58Heb 12:26 At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, "Once more I will shake not only the earth but also heaven."
58Heb 12:27 The expression "once more" signifies the removal of what can be shaken, that is, what he has made, so that what cannot be shaken may remain.
58Heb 12:28 Therefore, since we are receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, let us be thankful and worship God in reverence and fear in a way that pleases him.
58Heb 12:29 For our God is an all-consuming fire. 
58Heb 13:1 Let brotherly love continue.
58Heb 13:2 Stop neglecting to show hospitality to strangers, for by showing hospitality some have had angels as their guests without being aware of it.
58Heb 13:3 Continue to remember those in prison as if you were in prison with them, as well as those who are mistreated, since they also are only mortal.
58Heb 13:4 Let marriage be kept honorable in every way, and the marriage bed undefiled. For God will judge those who commit sexual sins, especially those who commit adultery. 
58Heb 13:5 Keep your lives free from the love of money, and be content with what you have, for God has said, "I will never leave you or abandon you."
58Heb 13:6 Hence we can confidently say, "The Lord is my helper; I will not be afraid. What can anyone do to me?"
58Heb 13:7 Remember your leaders, those who have spoken God's word to you. Think about the impact of their lives, and imitate their faith.
58Heb 13:8 Jesus, the Messiah, is the same yesterday and today - and forever! 
58Heb 13:9 Stop being carried away by all kinds of unusual teachings, for it is good that the heart be strengthened by grace, not by food laws that have never helped those who follow them. 
58Heb 13:10 We have an altar, and those who serve in the tabernacle have no right to eat at it.
58Heb 13:11 For the bodies of animals, whose blood is taken into the sanctuary by the high priest as an offering for sin, are burned outside the camp.
58Heb 13:12 That is why Jesus, in order to sanctify the people by his own blood, also suffered outside the city gate.
58Heb 13:13 Therefore go to him outside the camp and endure the insults he endured.
58Heb 13:14 For here we have no permanent city but are looking for the one that is coming.
58Heb 13:15 Therefore, through him let us always bring God a sacrifice of praise, that is, the fruit of our lips that confess his name.
58Heb 13:16 Do not neglect to do good and to be generous, for God is pleased with such sacrifices.
58Heb 13:17 Continue to obey your leaders and to be submissive to them, for they watch over your souls as those who will have to give a word of explanation. By doing this, you will be letting them carry out their duties joyfully, and not with grief, for that would be harmful for you.
58Heb 13:18 Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience and desire to live honorably in every way.
58Heb 13:19 I especially ask you to do this so that I may be brought back to you sooner.
58Heb 13:20 Now may the God of peace, who by the blood of the eternal covenant brought back from the dead our Lord Jesus, the Great Shepherd of the sheep,
58Heb 13:21 equip you with everything good to do his will, accomplishing in us what pleases him through Jesus, the Messiah. To him be glory forever and ever! Amen.
58Heb 13:22 I urge you, brothers, to listen patiently to my encouraging message, for I have written you a short letter.
58Heb 13:23 You should know that our brother Timothy has been set free. If he comes soon, he will be with me when I see you. 
58Heb 13:24 Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who are from Italy greet you. 
58Heb 13:25 May grace be with all of you!

59Jms 1:1 From£º James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus, the Messiah. To£º The twelve tribes in the Dispersion. Greetings.
59Jms 1:2 Consider it pure joy, my brothers, when you are involved in various trials,
59Jms 1:3 because you know that the testing of your faith produces endurance.
59Jms 1:4 But you must let endurance have its full effect, so that you may be mature and complete, lacking nothing.
59Jms 1:5 Now if any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God, who gives to everyone generously without a rebuke, and it will be given to him.
59Jms 1:6 But he must ask in faith, without any doubts, for the one who has doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.
59Jms 1:7 Such a person should not expect to receive anything from the Lord.
59Jms 1:8 He is a double-minded man, unstable in all he undertakes.
59Jms 1:9 A brother of humble means should rejoice in his having been exalted,
59Jms 1:10 and a rich person in his having been humbled, because he will fade away like a wild flower.
59Jms 1:11 For the sun comes up with its scorching heat and dries up the grass. The flower in it drops off, and its beauty is gone. That is how the rich person will fade away in his pursuits.
59Jms 1:12 How blessed is the man who endures temptation! When he has passed the test, he will receive the victor's crown of life that God has promised to those who keep on loving him.
59Jms 1:13 When someone is tempted, he should not say, "I am being tempted by God," because God cannot be tempted by evil, nor does he tempt anyone.
59Jms 1:14 Instead, each person is tempted by his own desire, being lured and trapped by it.
59Jms 1:15 When that desire becomes pregnant, it gives birth to sin; and when that sin grows up, it gives birth to death. 
59Jms 1:16 Do not be deceived, my dear brothers.
59Jms 1:17 Every generous act of giving and every perfect gift is from above and comes down from the Father who made the heavenly lights, in whom there is no inconsistency or shifting shadow.
59Jms 1:18 In accordance with his will he made us his children by the word of truth, so that we might become the most important of his creatures.1
59Jms 1:19 You must understand this, my dear brothers. Everyone should be quick to listen, slow to speak, and slow to get angry.
59Jms 1:20 For human anger does not produce the righteousness that God desires.
59Jms 1:21 Therefore, rid yourselves of everything impure and every expression of wickedness, and with a gentle spirit welcome the word planted in you that can save your souls. 
59Jms 1:22 Keep on being obedient to the word, and not merely being hearers who deceive themselves.
59Jms 1:23 For if anyone hears the word but is not obedient to it, he is like a man who looks at himself in a mirror
59Jms 1:24 and studies himself carefully, and then goes off and immediately forgets what he looks like.
59Jms 1:25 But the one who looks at the perfect law of freedom and remains committed to it - thereby demonstrating that he is not a forgetful hearer but a doer of what that law requires - will be blessed in what he does. 
59Jms 1:26 If anyone thinks that he is religious and does not bridle his tongue, but instead deceives himself, his religion is worthless.
59Jms 1:27 A religion that is pure and stainless according to God the Father is this£º to take care of orphans and widows who are suffering, and to keep oneself unstained by the world. 
59Jms 2:1 My brothers, do not let your faith in our glorious Lord Jesus, the Messiah, be tainted by favoritism.
59Jms 2:2 Suppose a man wearing gold rings and fine clothes comes into your assembly, and a poor man in dirty clothes also comes in.
59Jms 2:3 If you give special attention to the man wearing fine clothes and say, "Please take this seat," but you say to the poor man, "Stand over there" or "Sit on the floor at my feet,"
59Jms 2:4 then you will have made false distinctions among yourselves and will have judged from evil motives, will you not - 
59Jms 2:5 Listen, my dear brothers! God has chosen the poor in the world to become rich in faith and to be heirs of the kingdom that he promised to those who keep on loving him, has he not - 
59Jms 2:6 But you have humiliated the man who is poor. Are not rich people the ones who oppress you and drag you into court - 
59Jms 2:7 Are not they the ones who blaspheme the noble Name by which you have been called - 
59Jms 2:8 Nevertheless, you are doing the right thing if you obey the royal law in keeping with the Scripture, "You must love your neighbor as yourself."
59Jms 2:9 But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and will be convicted by the law as violators.
59Jms 2:10 For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point is guilty of breaking all of it.
59Jms 2:11 For the one who said, "Never commit adultery," also said, "Never murder." Now if you do not commit adultery, but you murder, you become a violator of the law.
59Jms 2:12 You must make it your habit to speak and act like people who are going to be judged by the law of liberty.
59Jms 2:13 For the one who has shown no mercy will be judged without mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment. 
59Jms 2:14 What good does it do, my brothers, if someone claims to have faith but does not prove it with actions? This kind of faith cannot save him, can it - 
59Jms 2:15 Suppose a brother or sister does not have any clothes or daily food
59Jms 2:16 and one of you tells them, "Go in peace! Stay warm and eat heartily." If you do not provide for their bodily needs, what good does it do - 
59Jms 2:17 In the same way, faith by itself, if it does not prove itself with actions, is dead.
59Jms 2:18 But someone may say, "You have faith, and I have actions." Show me your faith without any actions, and I will show you my faith by my actions.
59Jms 2:19 You believe that there is one God. That's fine! Even the demons believe that and tremble with fear.
59Jms 2:20 Do you want proof, you foolish person, that faith without actions is worthless - 
59Jms 2:21 Our ancestor Abraham was justified by his actions when he offered his son Isaac on the altar, wasn't he - 
59Jms 2:22 You see that his faith worked together with what he did, and by his actions his faith was made complete.
59Jms 2:23 And so the Scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was credited to him as righteousness." And so he was called God's friend.
59Jms 2:24 You observe that a person is justified through actions and not through faith alone.
59Jms 2:25 Likewise, Rahab the prostitute was justified through actions when she welcomed the messengers and sent them away on a different road, wasn't she - 
59Jms 2:26 For just as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without actions is also dead.218
59Jms 3:1 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, because you know that we who teach will be judged more severely than others.
59Jms 3:2 For all of us make many mistakes. If someone does not make any mistakes when he speaks, he is perfect and able to control his whole body.
59Jms 3:3 Now if we put bits into horses' mouths to make them obey us, we can guide their whole bodies as well.
59Jms 3:4 And look at ships! They are so big that it takes strong winds to drive them, yet they are steered by a tiny rudder wherever the helmsman directs.
59Jms 3:5 In the same way, the tongue is a small part of the body, yet it can boast of great achievements. A huge forest can be set on fire by a little flame.
59Jms 3:6 The tongue is a fire, a world of evil. Placed among the parts of our bodies, the tongue contaminates the whole body and sets on fire the course of life, and is itself set on fire by hell.
59Jms 3:7 For all kinds of animals, birds, reptiles, and sea creatures can be or have been tamed by humans,
59Jms 3:8 but no one can tame the tongue. It is an uncontrollable evil filled with deadly poison.
59Jms 3:9 With it we bless the Lord and Father, and with it we curse those who are made in God's likeness.
59Jms 3:10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. It should not be like this, my brothers!
59Jms 3:11 A spring cannot pour both fresh and brackish water from the same opening, can it - 
59Jms 3:12 My brothers, a fig tree cannot produce olives, nor a grapevine figs, can it? Neither can a salt spring produce fresh water.35
59Jms 3:13 Who among you is wise and understanding? Let him show by his noble conduct that his actions are done humbly and wisely.
59Jms 3:14 But if you have bitter jealousy and rivalry in your hearts, stop boasting and slandering the truth.
59Jms 3:15 That kind of wisdom does not come from above. No, it is worldly, self-centered, and demonic.
59Jms 3:16 For wherever jealousy and rivalry exist, there is disorder and every kind of evil. 
59Jms 3:17 However, the wisdom that comes from above is first of all pure, then peace-loving, gentle, willing to yield, full of compassion and good deeds, and without a trace of partiality or hypocrisy.
59Jms 3:18 And a harvest of righteousness is grown from the seed of peace planted by peacemakers. 
59Jms 4:1 Where do those fights and quarrels among you come from? They come from your selfish desires that are at war in your bodies, don't they - 
59Jms 4:2 You want something but do not get it, so you commit murder. You covet something but cannot obtain it, so you quarrel and fight. You do not get things because you do not ask for them!
59Jms 4:3 You ask for something but do not get it because you ask for it for the wrong reason - for your own pleasure. 
59Jms 4:4 You adulterers! Don't you know that friendship with the world means hostility with God? So whoever wants to be a friend of this world is an enemy of God.
59Jms 4:5 Or do you think the Scripture means nothing when it says that the Spirit that God caused to live in us jealously yearns for us - 
59Jms 4:6 But he gives all the more grace. And so he says, "God opposes the arrogant but gives grace to the humble."
59Jms 4:7 Therefore, submit yourselves to God. Resist the devil, and he will run away from you.
59Jms 4:8 Come close to God, and he will come close to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
59Jms 4:9 Be miserable, mourn, and cry. Let your laughter be turned into mourning, and your joy into gloom.
59Jms 4:10 Humble yourselves in the Lord's presence, and he will exalt you.48
59Jms 4:11 Do not criticize each other, brothers. Whoever makes it his habit to criticize his brother or to judge his brother is judging the law and condemning the law. But if you condemn the law, you are not a doer of the law but its judge.
59Jms 4:12 There is only one Lawgiver and Judge - the one who can save and destroy. So who are you to judge your neighbor - 
59Jms 4:13 Now listen, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go to such and such a town, stay there a year, conduct business, and make money."
59Jms 4:14 You do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? You are a mist that appears for a little while and then vanishes.
59Jms 4:15 Instead you should say, "If the Lord wants us to, we will live - and do this or that."
59Jms 4:16 But you boast about your proud intentions. All such boasting is evil.
59Jms 4:17 Therefore, anyone who knows what is right but fails to do it is guilty of sin. 
59Jms 5:1 Now listen, you rich people! Cry and moan over the miseries that are overtaking you.
59Jms 5:2 Your riches are rotten, your clothes have been eaten by moths,
59Jms 5:3 your gold and silver are corroded, and their corrosion will be used as evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have stored up treasures in these last days.
59Jms 5:4 Look! The wages that you kept back from the workers who harvested your fields are shouting out against you, and the cries of the reapers have reached the ears of the Lord of the Heavenly Armies.
59Jms 5:5 You have lived in luxury and pleasure on earth. You have fattened yourselves for the day of slaughter.
59Jms 5:6 You have condemned and murdered the one who is righteous, even though he did not rebel against you.
59Jms 5:7 So be patient, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious crop from his land, being patient with it until it receives the fall and the spring rains.
59Jms 5:8 You, too, must be patient. Strengthen your hearts, because the coming of the Lord is near.
59Jms 5:9 Do not complain about each other, brothers, or you will be condemned. Look! The Judge is standing at the door!
59Jms 5:10 As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord.
59Jms 5:11 We consider those who endured to be blessed. You have heard about Job's endurance and have seen the purpose of the Lord - that the Lord is compassionate and merciful. 
59Jms 5:12 Above all, brothers, do not swear oaths by heaven, by earth, or by any other object. Instead, let your "Yes" mean yes and your "No" mean no! Otherwise, you may fall under condemnation. 
59Jms 5:13 Is anyone among you suffering? He should keep on praying. Is anyone cheerful? He should keep reciting psalms.
59Jms 5:14 Is anyone among you sick? He should call for the elders of the church, and they should pray for him and anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord.
59Jms 5:15 And the prayer offered in faith will save the person who is sick. The Lord will raise him up, and if he has committed any sins, he will be forgiven.
59Jms 5:16 Therefore, make it your habit to confess your sins to one another and to pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person is powerful and effective.
59Jms 5:17 Elijah was a person just like us, and he prayed earnestly for it not to rain, and rain never came to the land for three years and six months.
59Jms 5:18 Then he prayed again, and the skies poured out rain, and the ground produced its crops.
59Jms 5:19 My brothers, if one of you wanders away from the truth and somebody brings him back,
59Jms 5:20 you may be sure that whoever brings a sinner back from his wrong path will save his soul from death and cover a multitude of sins.

601Pt 1:1 From£º Peter, an apostle of Jesus, the Messiah. To£º The exiles of the Dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
601Pt 1:2 the people chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father through the sanctifying action of the Spirit to be obedient to Jesus, the Messiah, and to be sprinkled with his blood. May grace and peace be yours in abundance! 
601Pt 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah! Because of his great mercy he has granted us a new birth, resulting in an immortal hope through the resurrection of Jesus, the Messiah, from the dead
601Pt 1:4 and to an inheritance kept in heaven for you that can't be destroyed, corrupted, or changed.
601Pt 1:5 Through faith you are being protected by God's power for a salvation that is ready to be revealed at the end of this era.
601Pt 1:6 You greatly rejoice in this, even though you have to suffer various kinds of trial for a little while,
601Pt 1:7 so that your genuine faith, which is more valuable than gold that perishes when tested by fire, may result in praise, glory, and honor when Jesus, the Messiah, is revealed. 
601Pt 1:8 Though you have not seen him, you love him. And even though you do not see him now, you believe in him and rejoice with an indescribable and glorious joy,
601Pt 1:9 because you are receiving the goal of your faith, the salvation of your souls. 
601Pt 1:10 Even the prophets, who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours, carefully researched and investigated this salvation.
601Pt 1:11 They tried to find out what era or specific time the Spirit of the Messiah in them kept referring to when he predicted the sufferings of the Messiah and the glories that would follow.
601Pt 1:12 It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you in regard to the things that have now been announced to you by those who brought you the good news through the Holy Spirit sent from heaven. These are things that even the angels desire to look into. 
601Pt 1:13 Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep a clear head, and set your hope completely on the grace to be given you when Jesus, the Messiah, is revealed.
601Pt 1:14 As obedient children, do not be shaped by the desires that used to influence you when you were ignorant.
601Pt 1:15 Instead, be holy in every aspect of your life, just as the one who called you is holy.
601Pt 1:16 For it is written, "You must be holy, because I am holy."1
601Pt 1:17 If you call "Father" the one who judges everyone impartially according to what they have done, you must live in reverent fear as long as you are strangers in a strange land.
601Pt 1:18 For you know that it was not with perishable things like silver or gold that you have been ransomed from the worthless way of life handed down to you by your ancestors,
601Pt 1:19 but with the precious blood of the Messiah, like that of a lamb without blemish or defect.
601Pt 1:20 On the one hand, he was foreknown before the creation of the world, but on the other hand, he was revealed at the end of time for your sake.
601Pt 1:21 Through him you believe in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope might be in God. 
601Pt 1:22 Now that you have obeyed the truth and have purified your souls to love your brothers sincerely, you must love one another intensely and with a pure heart.
601Pt 1:23 For you have been born again, not by a seed that perishes but by one that cannot perish - by the living and everlasting word of God.
601Pt 1:24 For "All human life is like grass, and all its glory is like a flower in the grass. The grass dries up and the flower drops off,
601Pt 1:25 but the word of the Lord lasts forever." Now this word is the good news that was announced to you.
601Pt 2:1 Therefore, rid yourselves of every kind of evil and deception, hypocrisy, jealousy, and every kind of slander.
601Pt 2:2 Like newborn babies, thirst for the pure milk of the word so that by it you may grow in your salvation.
601Pt 2:3 Surely you have tasted that the Lord is good!2
601Pt 2:4 As you come to him, the living stone who was rejected by people but was chosen and precious in God's sight,
601Pt 2:5 you, too, as living stones, are building yourselves up into a spiritual house and a holy priesthood, so that you may offer spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God through Jesus, the Messiah.
601Pt 2:6 This is why it says in Scripture£º "Look! I am laying a chosen, precious cornerstone in Zion. The one who believes in him will never be ashamed."
601Pt 2:7 Therefore he is precious to you who believe, but to those who do not believe, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,
601Pt 2:8 a stone they stumble over and a rock they trip on." They keep on stumbling because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.
601Pt 2:9 But you are a chosen people, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people to be his very own and to proclaim the wonderful deeds of the one who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. 
601Pt 2:10 Once you were not a people, but now you are the people of God. Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
601Pt 2:11 Dear friends, I urge you as aliens and exiles to keep on abstaining from the desires of the flesh that wage war against the soul.
601Pt 2:12 Continue to live such upright lives among the gentiles that, when they slander you as evildoers, they may see your good actions and glorify God when he visits them.
601Pt 2:13 For the Lord's sake submit yourselves to every human authority£º whether to the king as supreme,
601Pt 2:14 or to governors who are sent by him to punish those who do wrong and to praise those who do right.
601Pt 2:15 For it is God's will that by doing right you should silence the ignorant talk of foolish people.
601Pt 2:16 Live like free people, and do not use your freedom as an excuse for doing evil. Instead, be God's servants.
601Pt 2:17 Honor everyone. Keep on loving the community of believers, fearing God, and honoring the king.
601Pt 2:18 You household servants must submit yourselves to your masters out of respect, not only to those who are kind and fair, but also to those who are unjust.
601Pt 2:19 For it is a fine thing if, when moved by your conscience to please God, you suffer patiently when wronged.
601Pt 2:20 What good does it do if, when you sin, you patiently receive punishment for it? But if you suffer for doing good and receive it patiently, you have God's approval.
601Pt 2:21 This is, in fact, what you were called to do, because£º The Messiah also suffered for you and left an example for you to follow in his steps.
601Pt 2:22 "He never sinned, and he never told a lie."
601Pt 2:23 When he was insulted, he did not retaliate. When he suffered, he did not threaten. It was his habit to commit the matter to the one who judges fairly.
601Pt 2:24 "He himself bore our sins" in his body on the tree, so that we might die to those sins and live righteously. "By his wounds you have been healed."
601Pt 2:25 You were "like sheep that kept going astray," but now you have returned to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.
601Pt 3:1 In a similar way, you wives must submit yourselves to your husbands so that, even if some of them refuse to obey the word, they may be won over without a word through your conduct as wives
601Pt 3:2 when they see your pure and reverent lives. 
601Pt 3:3 Your beauty should not be an external one, consisting of braided hair or the wearing of gold ornaments and dresses.
601Pt 3:4 Instead, it should be the inner disposition of the heart, consisting in the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which God values greatly.
601Pt 3:5 After all, this is how holy women who set their hope on God used to make themselves beautiful in the past. They submitted themselves to their husbands,
601Pt 3:6 just as Sarah obeyed Abraham and called him lord. You have become her daughters by doing good and by not letting anything terrify you.
601Pt 3:7 In a similar way, you husbands must live with your wives in an understanding manner, as with a most delicate partner. Honor them as heirs with you of the gracious gift of life, so that nothing may interfere with your prayers. 
601Pt 3:8 Finally, all of you must live in harmony, be sympathetic, love as brothers, and be compassionate and humble.
601Pt 3:9 Do not pay others back evil for evil or insult for insult. Instead, keep blessing them, because you were called to inherit a blessing. 
601Pt 3:10 "For the person who wants to love life and see good days must keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit.
601Pt 3:11 He must turn away from evil and do good. He must seek peace and pursue it.
601Pt 3:12 For the Lord watches the righteous, and he pays attention to their prayers. But the Lord opposes those who do wrong."
601Pt 3:13 Who will harm you if you are devoted to doing what is good - 
601Pt 3:14 But even if you should suffer for doing what is right, you are blessed. "Never be afraid of their threats, and never get upset.
601Pt 3:15 Instead, exalt the Messiah" as Lord in your lives. Always be prepared to give a defense to everyone who asks you to explain the hope you have.
601Pt 3:16 But do this gently and respectfully, keeping a clear conscience, so that those who speak evil of your good conduct in the Messiah will be ashamed of slandering you.
601Pt 3:17 After all, if it is the will of God, it is better to suffer for doing right than for doing wrong.
601Pt 3:18 For the Messiah also suffered for sins once for all, an innocent person for the guilty, so that he could bring you to God. He was put to death in a mortal body but was brought to life by the Spirit,
601Pt 3:19 in which he went and made a proclamation to those imprisoned spirits
601Pt 3:20 who disobeyed long ago in the days of Noah, when God waited patiently while the ark was being built. In it a few, that is, eight persons, were saved by water.
601Pt 3:21 Baptism, which is symbolized by that water, now saves you also, not by removing dirt from the body, but by asking God for a clear conscience based on the resurrection of Jesus, the Messiah,
601Pt 3:22 who has gone to heaven and is at the right hand of God, where angels, authorities, and powers have been made subject to him. 
601Pt 4:1 Therefore, since the Messiah suffered in a mortal body, you, too, must arm yourselves with the same determination, because the person who has suffered in a mortal body has stopped sinning,
601Pt 4:2 so that he can live the rest of his mortal life guided, not by human desires, but by the will of God.
601Pt 4:3 For you spent enough time in the past doing what the gentiles like to do, living in sensuality, sinful desires, drunkenness, wild celebrations, drinking parties, and detestable idolatry.
601Pt 4:4 They insult you now because they are surprised that you are no longer joining them in the same excesses of wild living.
601Pt 4:5 They will give an account to the one who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
601Pt 4:6 Indeed, this is why the gospel was proclaimed even to those who have died, so that they could be judged in their mortal flesh like all humans and live in the spiritual realm like God.5
601Pt 4:7 Because everything will soon come to an end, be sensible and clear-headed, so you can pray.
601Pt 4:8 Above all, continue to love each other deeply, because love covers a multitude of sins.
601Pt 4:9 Show hospitality to one another without complaining.
601Pt 4:10 As good servant managers of God's grace in its various forms, serve one another with the gift each of you has received.
601Pt 4:11 Whoever speaks must speak God's words. Whoever serves must serve with the strength that God supplies, so that in every way God may be glorified through Jesus, the Messiah. Glory and power belong to him forever and ever! Amen.49
601Pt 4:12 Dear friends, do not be surprised by the fiery ordeal that is taking place among you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
601Pt 4:13 Instead, because you are participating in the sufferings of the Messiah, keep on rejoicing, so that you may be glad and shout for joy when his glory is revealed.
601Pt 4:14 If you are insulted because of the name of the Messiah, you are blessed, for the glorious Spirit of God is resting on you.
601Pt 4:15 Of course, none of you should suffer for being a murderer, thief, criminal, or troublemaker.
601Pt 4:16 But if you suffer for being a Christian, do not feel ashamed, but glorify God with that name.
601Pt 4:17 For the time has come for judgment to begin with the household of God. And if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who refuse to obey the gospel of God? 
601Pt 4:18 "If it is hard for the righteous person to be saved, what will happen to the ungodly and sinful person?"
601Pt 4:19 So then, those who suffer according to God's will should entrust their souls to their faithful Creator and continue to do what is good. 
601Pt 5:1 Therefore, as a fellow elder, a witness of the Messiah's sufferings, and one who shares in the glory to be revealed, I appeal to the elders among you£º
601Pt 5:2 Be shepherds of God's flock that is among you, watching over it, not because you must but because you want to, and not greedily but eagerly, as God desires.
601Pt 5:3 Do not lord it over the people entrusted to you, but be examples to the flock.
601Pt 5:4 Then, when the Chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the victor's crown of glory that will never fade away. 
601Pt 5:5 In a similar way, you young people must submit to the elders. All of you must clothe yourselves with humility for the sake of each other, because£º "God opposes the arrogant, but gives grace to the humble."
601Pt 5:6 Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time he may exalt you.
601Pt 5:7 Throw all your worry on him, because he cares for you.
601Pt 5:8 Be clear-minded and alert. Your opponent, the devil, is prowling around like a roaring lion, looking for someone to devour.
601Pt 5:9 Resist him and be firm in the faith, because you know that your brothers throughout the world are undergoing the same kinds of suffering.
601Pt 5:10 After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you by the Messiah Jesus to his eternal glory, will restore you, establish you, strengthen you, and support you.
601Pt 5:11 Power belongs to him forever and ever! Amen.
601Pt 5:12 Through Silvanus, whom I regard as a faithful brother, I have written this short letter to encourage you and to testify that this is to be the true grace of God in which you are to stand firm!
601Pt 5:13 Your sister church in Babylon, chosen along with you, sends you greetings, as does Mark, whom I regard as a son.
601Pt 5:14 Greet one another with a loving kiss. Peace be to all of you who are in the Messiah!
61
612Pt 1:1 From£º Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus, the Messiah. To£º Those who have received faith that is as valuable as ours through the righteousness of our God and Savior, Jesus the Messiah.
612Pt 1:2 May grace and peace be yours in abundance through full knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord! 
612Pt 1:3 His divine power has given us everything we need for life and godliness through the full knowledge of the one who called us by his own glory and excellence.
612Pt 1:4 Through these he has given us his precious and wonderful promises, so that through them you may participate in the divine nature, seeing that you have escaped the corruption that is in the world caused by evil desires.
612Pt 1:5 For this very reason, you must make every effort to supplement your faith with moral character, your moral character with knowledge,
612Pt 1:6 your knowledge with self-control, your self-control with endurance, your endurance with godliness,
612Pt 1:7 your godliness with brotherly kindness, and your brotherly kindness with love.
612Pt 1:8 For if you possess these qualities, and if they continue to increase among you, they will keep you from being ineffective and unproductive in attaining a full knowledge of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah.
612Pt 1:9 For the person who lacks these qualities is blind and shortsighted, and has forgotten the cleansing that he has received from his past sins. 
612Pt 1:10 So then, my brothers, be all the more eager to make your calling and election certain, for if you keep on doing this you will never fail.
612Pt 1:11 For in this way you will be generously granted entry into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus, the Messiah.
612Pt 1:12 Therefore, I intend to keep on reminding you about these things, even though you already know them and are firmly established in the truth that you now have.
612Pt 1:13 Yet I think it is right to refresh your memory as long as I am living in this bodily tent,
612Pt 1:14 because I know that the removal of my bodily tent will come soon, as indeed our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, has shown me.
612Pt 1:15 And I will make every effort to see that you will always remember these things after I am gone.
612Pt 1:16 When we told you about the power and coming of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah, we did not follow any clever myths. Rather, we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
612Pt 1:17 For he received honor and glory from God the Father when these words from the Majestic Glory were spoken about him£º "This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him."
612Pt 1:18 We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the holy mountain.
612Pt 1:19 Therefore we regard the message of the prophets as confirmed beyond doubt, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a lamp that is shining in a gloomy place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.
612Pt 1:20 First of all, you must understand this£º No prophecy in Scripture is a matter of one's own interpretation,
612Pt 1:21 because no prophecy ever originated through a human decision. Instead, men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
612Pt 2:1 Now there were false prophets among the people, just as there also will be false teachers among you, who will secretly introduce destructive heresies and even deny the Master who bought them, bringing swift destruction on themselves.
612Pt 2:2 Many people will follow their immoral ways, and because of them the way of truth will be maligned.
612Pt 2:3 In their greed they will exploit you with deceptive words. The ancient verdict against them is still in force, and their destruction is not delayed.
612Pt 2:4 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but threw them into the lowest hell and imprisoned them in chains of deepest darkness, holding them for judgment;
612Pt 2:5 and if he did not spare the ancient world but protected Noah, a righteous preacher, along with seven others when he brought the flood on the world of ungodly people;
612Pt 2:6 and if he condemned the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah and destroyed them by burning them to ashes, making them an example to ungodly people of what is going to happen to them;
612Pt 2:7 and if he rescued Lot, a righteous man who was greatly distressed by the immoral conduct of lawless people - 
612Pt 2:8 for as long as that righteous man lived among them, day after day he was being tortured in his righteous soul by what he saw and heard in their lawless actions - 
612Pt 2:9 then the Lord knows how to rescue godly people from their trials and to hold unrighteous people for punishment on the day of judgment,
612Pt 2:10 especially those who satisfy their flesh by indulging in its passions and who despise authority. Being bold and arrogant, they are not afraid to slander glorious beings.
612Pt 2:11 Yet even angels, although they are greater in strength and power, do not bring a slanderous accusation against them from the Lord.
612Pt 2:12 These people, like irrational animals, are mere creatures of instinct that are born to be caught and killed. They insult what they don't understand, and like animals they, too, will be destroyed,
612Pt 2:13 suffering harm as punishment for their wrongdoing. They take pleasure in wild parties in broad daylight. They are stains and blemishes, reveling in their deceitful pleasures while they eat with you.
612Pt 2:14 With eyes full of adultery, they cannot get enough of sin. They seduce unsteady souls and have had their hearts expertly trained in greed. They are doomed to a curse.
612Pt 2:15 They have left the straight path and wandered off to follow the path of Bosor's son Balaam, who loved the reward he got for doing wrong.
612Pt 2:16 But he was rebuked for his offense. A donkey that normally cannot talk spoke with a human voice and restrained the prophet's insanity.
612Pt 2:17 These men are dried-up springs, mere clouds driven by a storm. Gloomy darkness is reserved for them.
612Pt 2:18 By talking high-sounding nonsense and using sinful cravings of the flesh, they entice people who have just escaped from those who live in error.
612Pt 2:19 Promising them freedom, they themselves are slaves to depravity, for a person is a slave to whatever conquers him. 
612Pt 2:20 For if, after escaping the world's corruptions through a full knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus, the Messiah, they are again entangled and conquered by those corruptions, then their last condition is worse than their former one.
612Pt 2:21 It would have been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness than to know it and turn their backs on the holy commandment that was committed to them.
612Pt 2:22 The proverb is true that describes what has happened to them£º "A dog returns to its vomit," and "A pig that is washed goes back to wallow in the mud."
612Pt 3:1 Dear friends, this is now the second of two letters I am writing to you, in which I have been trying to stimulate your pure minds by reminding you
612Pt 3:2 to recall the words spoken in the past by the holy prophets and the commandment of our Lord and Savior spoken through your apostles. 
612Pt 3:3 First of all you must understand this£º In the last days mockers will come and, following their own desires, will ridicule us
612Pt 3:4 by saying, "What happened to the Messiah's promise to return? Ever since our ancestors died, everything continues as it did from the beginning of creation."
612Pt 3:5 But they deliberately ignore the fact that long ago the heavens existed and the earth was formed by God's word out of water and with water,
612Pt 3:6 by which the world at that time was deluged with water and destroyed.
612Pt 3:7 Now by that same word, the present heavens and earth have been reserved for fire and are being kept for the day when ungodly people will be judged and destroyed.4
612Pt 3:8 Don't forget this fact, dear friends£º With the Lord a single day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years are like a single day.
612Pt 3:9 The Lord is not slow about his promise, as some people understand slowness, but is being patient with you. He does not want anyone to perish, but wants everyone to repent.
612Pt 3:10 But the Day of the Lord will come like a thief. On that day the heavens will disappear with a roaring sound, the elements will be destroyed by fire, and the earth and everything done on it will be exposed. 
612Pt 3:11 Since everything will be destroyed in this way, think of the kind of holy and godly people you ought to be
612Pt 3:12 as you look forward to and hasten the coming of the day of God, when the heavens will be set ablaze and dissolved and the elements will melt with fire.
612Pt 3:13 But in keeping with his promise, we are looking forward to new heavens and a new earth, where righteousness is at home.
612Pt 3:14 So then, dear friends, since you are looking forward to this, make every effort to have the Lord find you at peace and without spot or fault.
612Pt 3:15 Think of our Lord's patience as facilitating salvation, just as our dear brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him.
612Pt 3:16 He speaks about this subject in all his letters. Some things in them are hard to understand, which ignorant and unstable people distort, leading to their own destruction, as they do the rest of the Scriptures. 
612Pt 3:17 And so, dear friends, since you already know these things, continually be on your guard not to be carried away by the deception of lawless people. Otherwise, you may fall from your secure position.
612Pt 3:18 Instead, continue to grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus, the Messiah. Glory belongs to him both now and on that eternal day! Amen.

621Jn 1:1 What existed from the beginning, what we have heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we observed and touched with our own hands - this is the Word of life!
621Jn 1:2 This life was revealed to us, and we have seen it and testify about it. We declare to you this eternal life that was with the Father and was revealed to us.
621Jn 1:3 What we have seen and heard we declare to you so that you, too, can have fellowship with us. Now this fellowship of ours is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus, the Messiah.
621Jn 1:4 We are writing these things so that our joy may be full. 
621Jn 1:5 This is the message that we have heard from him and declare to you£º God is light, and in him there is no darkness - none at all!
621Jn 1:6 If we claim that we have fellowship with him but keep living in darkness, we are lying and not practicing the truth.
621Jn 1:7 But if we keep living in the light as he himself is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.
621Jn 1:8 If we say that we do not have any sin, we are deceiving ourselves and we're not being truthful to ourselves.
621Jn 1:9 If we make it our habit to confess our sins, in his faithful righteousness he forgives us for those sins and cleanses us from all unrighteousness.
621Jn 1:10 If we say that we have never sinned, we make him a liar and his word has no place in us.
621Jn 2:1 My little children, I'm writing these things to you so that you might not sin. Yet if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father - Jesus, the Messiah, one who is righteous.
621Jn 2:2 It is he who is the atoning sacrifice for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the whole world's. 
621Jn 2:3 This is how we can be sure that we have come to know him£º if we continually keep his commandments.
621Jn 2:4 The person who says, "I have come to know him," but does not continually keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth has no place in that person.
621Jn 2:5 But whoever continually keeps his commandments is the kind of person in whom God's love has truly been perfected. This is how we can be sure that we are in union with God£º
621Jn 2:6 The one who says that he abides in him must live the same way he himself lived. 
621Jn 2:7 Dear friends, I am not writing to you a new commandment, but an old commandment that you have had from the beginning. This old commandment is the word you have heard.
621Jn 2:8 On the other hand, I am writing to you a new commandment that is truly in him and in you. For the darkness is fading away, and the true light is already shining. 
621Jn 2:9 The person who says that he is in the light but hates his brother is still in the darkness.
621Jn 2:10 The person who loves his brother abides in the light, and there is no reason for him to stumble.
621Jn 2:11 But the person who hates his brother is in the darkness and lives in the darkness. He does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes. 
621Jn 2:12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins have been forgiven on account of his name.
621Jn 2:13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you have known the one who has existed from the beginning. I am writing to you, young people, because you have overcome the evil one.
621Jn 2:14 I have written to you, little children, because you have known the Father. I have written to you, fathers, because you have known the one who has existed from the beginning. I have written to you, young people, because you are strong and because God's word remains in you and you have overcome the evil one.
621Jn 2:15 Stop loving the world and the things that are in the world. If anyone persists in loving the world, the Father's love is not in him.
621Jn 2:16 For everything that is in the world - the desire for fleshly gratification, the desire for possessions, and worldly arrogance - is not from the Father but is from the world.
621Jn 2:17 And the world and its desires are fading away, but the person who does God's will remains forever. 
621Jn 2:18 Little children, it is the last hour. Just as you heard that an antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have appeared. This is how we know it is the last hour.
621Jn 2:19 They left us, but they were not part of us, for if they had been part of us, they would have stayed with us. Their leaving made it clear that none of them was really part of us.
621Jn 2:20 You have an anointing from the Holy One and know all things.
621Jn 2:21 I have not written to you because you do not know the truth, but because you do know it and because lies don't come from truth.
621Jn 2:22 Who is a liar but the person who denies that Jesus is the Messiah? The person who denies the Father and the Son is an antichrist.
621Jn 2:23 No one who denies the Son has the Father. The person who acknowledges the Son also has the Father. 
621Jn 2:24 What you have heard from the beginning must abide in you. If what you have heard from the beginning abides in you, you will also abide in the Son and in the Father.
621Jn 2:25 The message that the Son himself declared to us is eternal life.
621Jn 2:26 I have written to you about those who are trying to deceive you.
621Jn 2:27 The anointing you received from God abides in you, and you do not need anyone to teach you this. Instead, because God's anointing teaches you about everything and is true and not a lie, abide in him, as he taught you to do.
621Jn 2:28 Even now, little children, abide in him. Then, when he appears, we will have confidence and will not turn away from him in shame when he comes.
621Jn 2:29 Since you know that he is righteous, you also know that everyone who practices righteousness has been fathered by God.
621Jn 3:1 See what kind of love the Father has given us£º We are called God's children - and that is what we are! For this reason the world does not recognize us, because it did not recognize him, either. 
621Jn 3:2 Dear friends, we are now God's children, but what we will be like has not been revealed yet. We know that when the Messiah is revealed, we will be like him, because we will see him as he is.
621Jn 3:3 And everyone who has this hope based on him keeps himself pure, just as the Messiah is pure.
621Jn 3:4 Everyone who keeps living in sin also practices disobedience. In fact, sin is disobedience.
621Jn 3:5 You know that the Messiah was revealed to take away sins, and there is not any sin in him.
621Jn 3:6 No one who remains in union with him keeps on sinning. The one who keeps on sinning hasn't seen him or known him. 
621Jn 3:7 Little children, don't let anyone deceive you. The person who practices righteousness is righteous, just as the Messiah is righteous.
621Jn 3:8 The person who practices sin belongs to the evil one, because the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason that the Son of God was revealed was to destroy what the devil has been doing.
621Jn 3:9 No one who has been born from God practices sin, because God's seed abides in him. Indeed, he cannot go on sinning, because he has been born from God.
621Jn 3:10 This is how God's children and the devil's children are distinguished. No person who fails to practice righteousness and to love his brother is from God.
621Jn 3:11 This is the message that you have heard from the beginning£º We should love one another.
621Jn 3:12 Do not be like Cain, who was from the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because what he was doing was evil and his brother's actions were righteous.
621Jn 3:13 So do not be surprised, brothers, if the world hates you.3
621Jn 3:14 We know that we have passed from death to life, because we love one another. The person who does not love remains spiritually dead.
621Jn 3:15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life present in him.
621Jn 3:16 This is how we have come to know love£º the Messiah gave his life for us. We, too, ought to give our lives for our brothers.
621Jn 3:17 Whoever has earthly possessions and notices a brother in need and yet withholds his compassion from him, how can the love of God be present in him - 
621Jn 3:18 Little children, we must stop expressing love merely by our words and manner of speech; we must love also in action and in truth.
621Jn 3:19 This is how we will know that we belong to the truth and how we will be able to keep ourselves strong in his presence. 
621Jn 3:20 If our hearts condemn us, God is greater than our hearts and knows everything.
621Jn 3:21 Dear friends, if our hearts do not condemn us, we have confidence in the presence of God.
621Jn 3:22 Whatever we request we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him.
621Jn 3:23 And this is his commandment£º to believe in the name of his Son, Jesus the Messiah, and to love one another as he commanded us.
621Jn 3:24 The person who keeps his commandments abides in God, and God abides in him. This is how we can be sure that he remains in us£º he has given us his Spirit. 
621Jn 4:1 Dear friends, stop believing every spirit. Instead, test the spirits to see whether they are from God, because many false prophets have gone out into the world. 
621Jn 4:2 This is how you can recognize God's Spirit£º Every spirit who acknowledges that Jesus the Messiah has become human - and remains so - is from God.
621Jn 4:3 But every spirit who does not acknowledge Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist. You have heard that he is coming, and now he is already in the world.
621Jn 4:4 Little children, you belong to God and have overcome them, because the one who is in you is greater than the one who is in the world.
621Jn 4:5 These people belong to the world. That is why they speak from the world's perspective, and the world listens to them.
621Jn 4:6 We belong to God. The person who knows God listens to us. Whoever does not belong to God does not listen to us. This is how we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of deceit.4
621Jn 4:7 Dear friends, let us continually love one another, because love comes from God. Everyone who loves has been born from God and knows God.
621Jn 4:8 The person who does not love does not know God, because God is love.
621Jn 4:9 This is how God's love was revealed among us£º God sent his unique Son into the world so that we might live through him.
621Jn 4:10 This is love£º not that we have loved God, but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the atoning sacrifice for our sins.
621Jn 4:11 Dear friends, if this is the way God loved us, we must also love one another.
621Jn 4:12 No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God lives in us, and his love is perfected in us.
621Jn 4:13 This is how we know that we abide in him and he in us£º he has given us his Spirit. 
621Jn 4:14 We have seen for ourselves and can testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.
621Jn 4:15 God abides in the one who acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, and he abides in God.
621Jn 4:16 We have come to know and rely on the love that God has for us. God is love, and the person who abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.
621Jn 4:17 This is how love has been perfected among us£º we will have confidence on the day of judgment because, during our time in this world, we are just like him.
621Jn 4:18 There is no fear where love exists. Rather, perfect love banishes fear, for fear involves punishment, and the person who lives in fear has not been perfected in love. 
621Jn 4:19 We love because God first loved us.
621Jn 4:20 Whoever says, "I love God," but hates his brother is a liar. The one who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love the God whom he has not seen.
621Jn 4:21 And this is the commandment that we have from him£º the person who loves God must also love his brother. 
621Jn 5:1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Messiah has been born from God, and everyone who loves the parent also loves the child.
621Jn 5:2 This is how we know that we love God's children£º we love God and keep his commandments.
621Jn 5:3 For this demonstrates our love for God£º We keep his commandments, and his commandments are not difficult,
621Jn 5:4 because everyone who is born from God has overcome the world. Our faith is the victory that overcomes the world.
621Jn 5:5 Who overcomes the world? Is it not the person who believes that Jesus is the Son of God - 
621Jn 5:6 This man, Jesus the Messiah, is the one who came by water and blood - not with water only, but with water and with blood. The Spirit is the one who verifies this, because the Spirit is the truth.
621Jn 5:7 For there are three witnesses - 
621Jn 5:8 the Spirit, the water, and the blood - and these three are one.
621Jn 5:9 If we accept human testimony, God's testimony is greater, because it is the testimony of God and because he has testified about his Son.
621Jn 5:10 The person who believes in the Son of God believes this testimony personally. The person who does not believe God has made him a liar by not believing the testimony that he has given about his Son. 
621Jn 5:11 This is the testimony£º God has given us eternal life, and this life is found in his Son.
621Jn 5:12 The person who has the Son has this life. The person who does not have the Son of God does not have this life. 
621Jn 5:13 I have written these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God so that you may know that you have eternal life.
621Jn 5:14 And this is the confidence that we have in him£º if we ask for anything according to his will, he listens to us.
621Jn 5:15 And if we know that he listens to our requests, we can be sure that we have what we ask him for.
621Jn 5:16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin that does not lead to death, he should pray that God would give him life. This applies to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is a sin that leads to death. I am not telling you to pray about that.
621Jn 5:17 Every kind of wrongdoing is sin, yet there are sins that do not lead to death. 
621Jn 5:18 We know that the person who has been born from God does not go on sinning. Rather, the Son of God protects them, and the evil one cannot harm them.
621Jn 5:19 We know that we are from God and that the whole world lies under the control of the evil one.
621Jn 5:20 We also know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding so that we may know the true God. We are in union with the one who is true, his Son Jesus the Messiah, who is the true God and eternal life.
621Jn 5:21 Little children, keep yourselves away from idols.
63
632Jn 1:1 From£º The Elder To£º The chosen lady and her children, whom I genuinely love, and not only I but also all who know the truth,
632Jn 1:2 that is present in us and will be with us forever.
632Jn 1:3 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us from God the Father and from Jesus the Messiah, the Father's Son, in truth and love. 
632Jn 1:4 I was overjoyed to find some of your children living truthfully, just as the Father has commanded us.
632Jn 1:5 Dear lady, I am now requesting of you that we all continue to love one another. It is not as though I am writing to give you a new commandment, but one that we have had from the beginning.
632Jn 1:6 And this is what demonstrates love£º that we live according to God's commandments. Just as you have heard from the beginning what he commanded, you must live by it.
632Jn 1:7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world. They refuse to acknowledge Jesus the Messiah as having become human. Any such person is a deceiver and an antichrist.
632Jn 1:8 See to it that you don't destroy what we have worked for, but that you receive your full reward.
632Jn 1:9 Everyone who does not remain true to the teaching of the Messiah, but goes beyond it, does not have God. The person who remains true to the teaching of the Messiah has both the Father and the Son.
632Jn 1:10 If anyone comes to you but does not present his teachings, do not receive him into your house or even welcome him,
632Jn 1:11 because the one who welcomes him shares in his evil deeds.
632Jn 1:12 Although I have a great deal to write to you, I would prefer not to use paper and ink. Instead, I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
632Jn 1:13 The children of your chosen sister greet you.
64
643Jn 1:1 From£º The Elder To£º My dear friend Gaius, whom I genuinely love.
643Jn 1:2 Dear friend, I pray that you are doing well in every way and that you are healthy, just as your soul is healthy.
643Jn 1:3 I was overjoyed when some brothers arrived and testified about your truthfulness and how you live according to the truth.
643Jn 1:4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are living according to the truth. 
643Jn 1:5 Dear friend, you are faithful in whatever you do for the brothers, especially when they are strangers.
643Jn 1:6 They have testified before the church about your love. You will do well to send them on their way in a manner worthy of God.
643Jn 1:7 After all, they went on their trip for the sake of the Name, accepting no support from gentiles.
643Jn 1:8 Therefore, we ought to support such people so that we can become genuine helpers with them.
643Jn 1:9 I wrote a letter to the church, but Diotrephes, who loves to be in charge, will not recognize our authority.
643Jn 1:10 For this reason, when I come I will call attention to what he is doing in spreading false charges against us. And not content with that, he refuses to receive the brothers. He even tries to stop those who want to accept them and throws them out of the church.
643Jn 1:11 Dear friend, do not imitate what is evil, but what is good. The person who does what is good is from God. The person who does what is evil has never seen God.
643Jn 1:12 Demetrius has received a good report from everyone, including the truth itself. We, too, can testify to this report, and you know that our testimony is true. 
643Jn 1:13 Although I have a great deal to write to you, I would rather not write with pen and ink.
643Jn 1:14 Instead, I hope to see you soon and speak face to face. May peace be with you! Your friends greet you. Greet each of our friends by name.
65
65Jd 1:1 From£º Jude, a servant of Jesus the Messiah, and yet a brother of James. To£º Those who have been called, who are loved by God the Father and kept safe by Jesus, the Messiah.
65Jd 1:2 May mercy, peace, and love be yours in abundance! 
65Jd 1:3 Dear friends, although I was eager to write to you about the salvation we share, I found it necessary to write to you and urge you to continue your vigorous defense of the faith that was passed down to the saints once and for all.
65Jd 1:4 For some people have slipped in among you unnoticed. They were written about long ago as being deserving of this condemnation because they are ungodly. They turn the grace of our God into uncontrollable lust and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus the Messiah. 
65Jd 1:5 Now I want to remind you, even though you are fully aware of these things, that the Lord who once saved his people from the land of Egypt later destroyed those who did not believe.
65Jd 1:6 He has also held in eternal chains those angels who did not keep their own position but abandoned their assigned place. They are held in deepest darkness for judgment on the great day.
65Jd 1:7 Likewise, Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities near them, which like them committed sexual sins and pursued homosexual activities, serve as an example of the punishment of eternal fire. 
65Jd 1:8 In a similar way, these dreamers also defile their flesh, reject the Lord's authority, and slander his glorious beings.
65Jd 1:9 Even the archangel Michael, when he argued with the devil and fought over the body of Moses, did not dare to bring a slanderous accusation against him. Instead, he said, "May the Lord rebuke you!"
65Jd 1:10 Whatever these people do not understand, they slander. Like irrational animals, they are destroyed by the very things they know by instinct.
65Jd 1:11 How terrible it will be for them! For they lived like Cain did, rushed headlong into Balaam's error to make a profit, and destroyed themselves, as happened in Korah's rebellion.
65Jd 1:12 These people are stains on your love feasts. They feast with you without any sense of awe. They are shepherds who care only for themselves. They are waterless clouds blown about by the winds. They are autumn trees that are fruitless, totally dead, and uprooted.
65Jd 1:13 They are wild waves of the sea, churning up the foam of their own shame. They are wandering stars for whom the deepest darkness has been reserved forever. 
65Jd 1:14 Enoch, in the seventh generation from Adam, prophesied about these people when he said, "Look! The Lord has come with countless thousands of his holy ones.
65Jd 1:15 He will judge all people and convict everyone of all the ungodly things that they have done in such an ungodly way, including all the harsh things that these ungodly sinners have said about him."
65Jd 1:16 These people are complainers and faultfinders, following their own desires. They say arrogant things and flatter people in order to take advantage of them. 
65Jd 1:17 But you, dear friends, must remember the statements and predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus, the Messiah.
65Jd 1:18 They kept telling you, "In the last times mockers will appear, following their own ungodly desires."
65Jd 1:19 These are the people who cause divisions. They are worldly, devoid of the Spirit. 
65Jd 1:20 But you, dear friends, must continue to build your most holy faith for your own benefit. Furthermore, continue to pray in the Holy Spirit.
65Jd 1:21 Remain in God's love as you look for the mercy of our Lord Jesus the Messiah, which brings eternal life.
65Jd 1:22 Show mercy to those who have doubts.
65Jd 1:23 Save others by snatching them from the fire. To others, show mercy with fear, hating even the clothes stained by their sinful lives.
65Jd 1:24 Now to the one who is able to keep you from falling and to make you stand joyful and faultless in his glorious presence,
65Jd 1:25 to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus the Messiah, our Lord, be glory, majesty, power, and authority before all time and for all eternity! Amen.

66Rv 1:1 This is the revelation of Jesus the Messiah, which God gave him to show his servants the things that must happen soon. He made it known by sending his messenger to his servant John,
66Rv 1:2 who testified about this message from God and the testimony about Jesus the Messiah.
66Rv 1:3 How blessed is the one who reads aloud and those who hear the words of this prophecy and obey what is written in it, for the time is near! 
66Rv 1:4 From John to the seven churches in Asia. May grace and peace be yours from the one who is, who was, and who is coming, from the seven spirits who are in front of his throne,
66Rv 1:5 and from Jesus the Messiah, the witness, the faithful one, the firstborn from the dead, and the ruler over the kings of the earth. To the one who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood
66Rv 1:6 and has made us a kingdom, priests for his God and Father, be glory and power forever and ever! Amen. 
66Rv 1:7 Look! He is coming in the clouds. Every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all the tribes of the earth will mourn because of him. So be it! Amen.
66Rv 1:8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega," declares the Lord God, "the one who is, who was, and who is coming, the Almighty."
66Rv 1:9 I am John, your brother and partner in the oppression, kingdom, and patience that comes because of Jesus. I was on the island called Patmos because of the word of God and the testimony about Jesus.
66Rv 1:10 I came to be in the Spirit on the Day of the Lord, when I heard a loud voice behind me like a trumpet,
66Rv 1:11 saying, "Write on a scroll what you see, and send it to the seven churches£º Ephesus, Smyrna, Pergamum, Thyatira, Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea." 
66Rv 1:12 Then I turned to see who was talking to me, and when I turned I saw seven gold lamp stands.
66Rv 1:13 Among the lamp stands there was someone like the Son of Man. He was wearing a long robe with a gold sash around his chest.
66Rv 1:14 His head and his hair were white like wool, in fact, as white as snow. His eyes were like flames of fire,
66Rv 1:15 his feet were like glowing bronze refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the sound of raging waters.
66Rv 1:16 In his right hand he held seven stars, and out of his mouth came a sharp, two-edged sword. His face was like the sun when it shines with full force.1
66Rv 1:17 When I saw him, I fell down at his feet like a dead man. But he placed his right hand on me and said, "Stop being afraid! I am the first and the last,
66Rv 1:18 the living one. I was dead, but look - I am alive forever and ever! I have the keys of Death and Hades.
66Rv 1:19 Therefore, write down what you have seen, what is, and what is going to happen after this.
66Rv 1:20 The secret meaning of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand and the seven gold lamp stands is this£º the seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches, and the seven lamp stands are the seven churches."
66Rv 2:1 "To the messenger of the church in Ephesus, write£º 'The one who holds the seven stars in his right hand, the one who walks among the seven gold lamp stands, says this£º
66Rv 2:2 'I know what you've been doing, your toil, and your endurance. I also know that you cannot tolerate evil people. You have tested those who call themselves apostles, but are not, and have found them to be false.
66Rv 2:3 You have endured and suffered because of my name, yet you have not grown weary.
66Rv 2:4 However, I have this against you£º You have abandoned the love you had at first.
66Rv 2:5 Therefore, remember how far you have fallen. Repent and go back to what you were doing at first. If you don't, I will come to you and remove your lamp stand from its place - unless you repent.
66Rv 2:6 But this is to your credit£º You hate the actions of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. 
66Rv 2:7 'Let everyone listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To everyone who conquers I will give the privilege of eating from the tree of life that is in God's paradise.'" 
66Rv 2:8 "To the messenger of the church in Smyrna, write£º 'The first and the last, who was dead and became alive, says this£º
66Rv 2:9 'I know your suffering and your poverty - though you are rich - and the slander committed by those who claim to be Jews but are not. They are the synagogue of Satan.
66Rv 2:10 Don't be afraid of what you are going to suffer. Look! The devil is going to throw some of you into prison so that you may be tested. For ten days you will undergo suffering. Be faithful until death, and I will give you the victor's crown of life. 
66Rv 2:11 'Let everyone listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will never be hurt by the second death.'" 
66Rv 2:12 "To the messenger of the church in Pergamum, write£º 'The one who holds the sharp, two-edged sword, says this£º
66Rv 2:13 'I know where you live. Satan's throne is there. Yet you hold on to my name and have not denied your faith in me, even in the days of Antipas, my faithful witness, who was killed in your presence, where Satan lives.
66Rv 2:14 But I have a few things against you£º You have there some who hold to the teaching of Balaam, the one who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the people of Israel so that they would eat food sacrificed to idols and practice immorality.
66Rv 2:15 You also have some who hold to the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
66Rv 2:16 So repent. If you don't, I will come to you quickly and wage war against them with the sword of my mouth. 
66Rv 2:17 'Let everyone listen to what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna. I will also give him a white stone. On the white stone is written a new name that no one knows except the person who receives it.'"2
66Rv 2:18 "To the messenger of the church in Thyatira, write£º 'The Son of God, whose eyes are like flaming fire and whose feet are like glowing bronze, says this£º
66Rv 2:19 'I know what you've been doing - your love, faithfulness, service, and endurance - and that your last actions are greater than the first.
66Rv 2:20 But I have this against you£º You tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophet and who teaches and leads my servants to practice immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.
66Rv 2:21 I gave her time to repent, but she refused to repent of her immorality.
66Rv 2:22 Look! I am going to strike her with illness. Those who commit adultery with her will also suffer greatly, unless they repent from acting like her.
66Rv 2:23 I will strike her children dead. Then all the churches will know that I am the one who searches minds and hearts. I will reward each of you as your actions deserve. 
66Rv 2:24 'But as for the rest of you in Thyatira - you who do not hold to this teaching and who have not learned what some people call the deep things of Satan - I won't burden you with anything else.
66Rv 2:25 Just hold on to what you have until I come.
66Rv 2:26 To the person who conquers and continues to do what I've commanded to the end, I will give authority over the nations.224
66Rv 2:27 'He will rule them with an iron scepter; shattering them like clay pots.'
66Rv 2:28 Just as I have received authority from my Father, I will also give him the morning star. 
66Rv 2:29 'Let everyone listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.'"
66Rv 3:1 "To the messenger of the church in Sardis, write£º 'The one who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars says this£º 'I know what you've been doing. You are known for being alive, but you are dead.
66Rv 3:2 Be alert, and strengthen the things that are left, which are about to die. I note that your actions are incomplete before my God.
66Rv 3:3 So remember what you received and heard. Obey it, and repent. If you are not alert, I will come like a thief, and you won't know the time when I will come to you.
66Rv 3:4 But you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their clothes. They will walk with me in white clothes because they are worthy.
66Rv 3:5 The person who conquers in this way will wear white clothes, and I will never erase his name from the Book of Life. I will acknowledge his name in the presence of my Father and his angels. 
66Rv 3:6 'Let everyone listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.'"
66Rv 3:7 "To the messenger of the church in Philadelphia, write£º 'The one who is holy, who is true, who has the key of David, who opens a door that no one can shut, and who shuts a door that no one can open, says this£º
66Rv 3:8 'I know what you've been doing. Look! I have put in front of you an open door that no one can shut. You have only a little strength, but you have obeyed my word and have not denied my name.
66Rv 3:9 I will make those who belong to the synagogue of Satan - those who claim to be Jews and aren't, but are lying - come and bow down at your feet. Then they will realize that I have loved you.
66Rv 3:10 Because you have obeyed my command to endure, I will keep you from the hour of testing that is coming to the whole world to test those living on the earth.
66Rv 3:11 I am coming soon! Hold on to what you have so that no one takes your victor's crown.
66Rv 3:12 I will make the one who conquers to become a pillar in the sanctuary of my God, and he will never go out of it again. I will write on him the name of my God, the name of the city of my God (the new Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God), and my own new name.3
66Rv 3:13 'Let everyone listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.'"
66Rv 3:14 "To the messenger of the church in Laodicea, write£º 'The Amen, the witness who is faithful and true, the originator of God's creation, says this£º
66Rv 3:15 'I know your actions, that you are neither cold nor hot. I wish you were cold or hot.
66Rv 3:16 Since you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I am going to spit you out of my mouth.
66Rv 3:17 You say, "I am rich. I have become wealthy. I don't need anything." Yet you don't realize that you are miserable, pitiful, poor, blind, and naked.
66Rv 3:18 Therefore, I advise you to buy from me gold purified in fire so you may be rich, white clothes to wear so your shameful nakedness won't show, and ointment to put on your eyes so you may see.
66Rv 3:19 I correct and discipline those whom I love, so be serious and repent!
66Rv 3:20 Look! I am standing at the door and knocking. If anyone listens to my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he will eat with me.
66Rv 3:21 To the one who conquers I will give a place to sit with me on my throne, just as I have conquered and have sat down with my Father on his throne. 
66Rv 3:22 'Let everyone listen to what the Spirit says to the churches.'" 
66Rv 4:1 After these things I saw a door standing open in heaven. The first voice that I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must happen after this."
66Rv 4:2 Instantly I was in the Spirit, and I saw a throne in heaven with a person seated on the throne.
66Rv 4:3 The person sitting there looked like jasper and carnelian, and there was a rainbow around the throne that looked like an emerald.
66Rv 4:4 Around the throne were 24 other thrones, and on these thrones sat 24 elders wearing white robes and gold victor's crowns on their heads.
66Rv 4:5 Flashes of lightning, noises, and peals of thunder came from the throne. Burning in front of the throne were seven flaming torches, which are the seven spirits of God.41
66Rv 4:6 In front of the throne was something like a sea of glass as clear as crystal. In the center of the throne and on each side of the throne were four living creatures full of eyes in front and in back.
66Rv 4:7 The first living creature was like a lion, the second living creature was like an ox, the third living creature had a face like a human, and the fourth living creature was like a flying eagle.
66Rv 4:8 Each of the four living creatures had six wings and were full of eyes inside and out. Without stopping day or night they were saying, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty,who was, who is, and who is coming." 
66Rv 4:9 Whenever the living creatures give glory, honor, and thanks to the one who sits on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
66Rv 4:10 the 24 elders bow down and worship in front of the one who sits on the throne, the one who lives forever and ever. They throw their victor's crowns in front of the throne and say, 
66Rv 4:11 "You are worthy, our Lord and God, to receive glory, honor, and power, because you created all things; they came into existence and were created because of your will."
66Rv 5:1 Then I saw in the right hand of the one who sits on the throne a scroll written on the inside and on the outside, sealed with seven seals.
66Rv 5:2 I also saw a powerful angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?"
66Rv 5:3 No one in heaven, on earth, or under the earth could open the scroll or look inside it.
66Rv 5:4 I began to cry bitterly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or look inside it.
66Rv 5:5 "Stop crying," one of the elders said to me. "Look! The Lion from the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered. He can open the scroll and its seven seals." 
66Rv 5:6 Then I saw a lamb standing in the middle of the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders. He looked like he had been slaughtered. He had seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent into all the earth.
66Rv 5:7 He went and took the scroll from the right hand of the one who sits on the throne. 
66Rv 5:8 When the lamb had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders bowed down in front of him. Each held a harp and a gold bowl full of incense, the prayers of the saints.
66Rv 5:9 They sang a new song£º "You are worthy to take the scroll and open its seals, because you were slaughtered. With your blood you purchased people for God from every tribe, language, people, and nation.
66Rv 5:10 You made them a kingdom and priests for our God, and they will reign on the earth."
66Rv 5:11 Then I looked, and I heard the voices of many angels, the living creatures, and the elders surrounding the throne. They numbered 10,000's times 10,000 and thousands times thousands.
66Rv 5:12 They sang with a loud voice, "Worthy is the lamb who was slaughtered to receive power, wealth, wisdom, strength, honor, glory, and praise!"
66Rv 5:13 I heard every creature in heaven, on earth, under the earth, and on the sea, and everything that is in them, saying, "To the one who sits on the throne and to the lamb be praise, honor, glory, and power forever and ever!"
66Rv 5:14 Then the four living creatures said, "Amen!", and the elders bowed down and worshiped. 
66Rv 6:1 Then I saw the lamb open the first of the seven seals. I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, "Go!"
66Rv 6:2 Then I looked, and there was a white horse! Its rider had a bow, and a victor's crown had been given to him. He went out as a conqueror to conquer. 
66Rv 6:3 When the lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Go!"
66Rv 6:4 A second horse went out. It was fiery red, and its rider was given permission to take peace away from the earth and to make people slaughter one another. So he was given a large sword. 
66Rv 6:5 When the lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Go!" I looked, and there was a black horse! Its rider held a scale in his hand.
66Rv 6:6 I heard what sounded like a voice from among the four living creatures, saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, or three quarts of barley for a denarius. But don't damage the olive oil or the wine!" 
66Rv 6:7 When the lamb opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Go!"
66Rv 6:8 I looked, and there was a pale green horse! Its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him. They were given authority over one-fourth of the earth to kill people using wars, famines, plagues, and the wild animals of the earth. 
66Rv 6:9 When the lamb opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slaughtered because of the word of God and the testimony they had given.
66Rv 6:10 They cried out in a loud voice, "Holy and true Sovereign, how long will it be before you judge and take revenge on those living on the earth who shed our blood?"
66Rv 6:11 Each of them was given a white robe. They were told to rest a little longer until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers was completed, who would be killed as they themselves had been.6 
66Rv 6:12 Then I saw the lamb open the sixth seal. There was a powerful earthquake. The sun turned as black as sackcloth made of hair, and the full moon turned as red as blood.
66Rv 6:13 The stars in the sky fell to the earth like a fig tree drops its fruit when it is shaken by a strong wind.
66Rv 6:14 The sky vanished like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was moved from its place.
66Rv 6:15 Then the kings of the earth, the important people, the generals, the rich, the powerful, and all the slaves and free people concealed themselves in caves and among the rocks in the mountains.
66Rv 6:16 They said to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of the one who sits on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb.
66Rv 6:17 For the great day of their wrath has come, and who is able to endure it?" 
66Rv 7:1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth. They were holding back the four winds of the earth so that no wind could blow on the land, on the sea, or on any tree.
66Rv 7:2 I saw another angel coming from the east having the seal of the living God. He cried out in a loud voice to the four angels who had been permitted to harm the land and sea,
66Rv 7:3 "Don't harm the land, the sea, or the trees until we have marked the servants of our God with a seal on their foreheads." 
66Rv 7:4 I heard the number of those who were sealed£º144,000. Those who were sealed were from every tribe of Israel£º 
66Rv 7:5 12,000 from the tribe of Judah were sealed, 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben, 12,000 from the tribe of Gad,
66Rv 7:6 12,000 from the tribe of Asher, 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,
66Rv 7:7 12,000 from the tribe of Simeon, 12,000 from the tribe of Levi, 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,
66Rv 7:8 12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph, and 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed.
66Rv 7:9 After these things I looked, and there was a crowd so large that no one was able to count it! They were from every nation, tribe, people, and language. They were standing in front of the throne and the lamb and were wearing white robes, with palm branches in their hands.
66Rv 7:10 They cried out in a loud voice, "Salvation belongs to our God, who sits on the throne, and to the lamb!"
66Rv 7:11 All the angels stood around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures. They fell on their faces in front of the throne and worshiped God,
66Rv 7:12 saying, "Amen! Praise, glory, wisdom, thanks, honor, power, and strength be to our God forever and ever! Amen!"
66Rv 7:13 "Who are these people wearing white robes," one of the elders asked me, "and where did they come from?" 
66Rv 7:14 I said to him, "Sir, you know." Then he told me, "These are the people who are coming out of the terrible suffering. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the lamb.
66Rv 7:15 That is why£º "They are in front of the throne of God and worship him night and day in his temple. The one who sits on the throne will shelter them.
66Rv 7:16 They will never be hungry or thirsty again. Neither the sun nor its heat will ever beat down on them,
66Rv 7:17 because the lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd. He will lead them to springs filled with the water of life, and God will wipe every tear from their eyes."
66Rv 8:1 When the lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour. 
66Rv 8:2 Then I saw the seven angels who stand in God's presence, and seven trumpets were given to them.
66Rv 8:3 Another angel came with a gold censer and stood at the altar. He was given a large quantity of incense to offer on the gold altar before the throne, along with the prayers of all the saints.
66Rv 8:4 The smoke from the incense and the prayers of the saints went up from the angel's hand to God.
66Rv 8:5 The angel took the censer, filled it with fire from the altar, and threw it on the earth. Then there were peals of thunder, noises, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
66Rv 8:6 The seven angels who had the seven trumpets got ready to blow them.84
66Rv 8:7 When the first angel blew his trumpet, hail and fire were mixed with blood and thrown on the earth. One-third of the earth was burned up, one-third of the trees was burned up, and all the green grass was burned up. 
66Rv 8:8 When the second angel blew his trumpet, something like a huge mountain burning with fire was thrown into the sea. One-third of the sea turned into blood,
66Rv 8:9 one-third of the creatures that were living in the sea died, and one-third of the ships was destroyed. 
66Rv 8:10 When the third angel blew his trumpet, a huge star blazing like a torch fell from heaven. It fell on one-third of the rivers and on the springs of water.
66Rv 8:11 The name of the star is Wormwood. One-third of the water turned into wormwood, and many people died from the water because it had turned bitter. 
66Rv 8:12 When the fourth angel blew his trumpet, one-third of the sun, one-third of the moon, and one-third of the stars were struck so that one-third of them turned dark. One-third of the day was kept from having light, as was the night.
66Rv 8:13 Then I looked, and I heard an eagle flying overhead say in a loud voice, "How terrible, how terrible, how terrible for those living on the earth, because of the blasts of the remaining trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!" 
66Rv 9:1 When the fifth angel blew his trumpet, I saw a star that had fallen to earth from the sky. The star was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit.
66Rv 9:2 It opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and smoke came out of the shaft like the smoke from a large furnace. The sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft.
66Rv 9:3 Locusts came out of the smoke onto the earth, and they were given power like that of earthly scorpions.
66Rv 9:4 They were told not to harm the grass on the earth, any green plant, or any tree. They could harm only the people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
66Rv 9:5 They were not allowed to kill them, but were only allowed to torture them for five months. Their torture was like the pain of a scorpion when it stings someone.
66Rv 9:6 In those days people will seek death, but never find it. They will long to die, but death will escape them. 
66Rv 9:7 The locusts looked like horses prepared for battle. On their heads were victor's crowns that looked like gold, and their faces were like human faces.
66Rv 9:8 They had hair like women's hair and teeth like lions' teeth.
66Rv 9:9 They had breastplates like iron, and the noise of their wings was like the roar of chariots with many horses rushing into battle.
66Rv 9:10 They had tails and stingers like scorpions, and they had the power to hurt people with their tails for five months.
66Rv 9:11 They had the angel of the bottomless pit ruling over them as king. In Hebrew he is called Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon.
66Rv 9:12 The first catastrophe is over. After these things there are still two more catastrophes to come. 
66Rv 9:13 When the sixth angel blew his trumpet, I heard a voice from the four horns of the gold altar in front of God.
66Rv 9:14 It said to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are held at the great Euphrates River."
66Rv 9:15 So the four angels who were ready for that hour, day, month, and year were released to kill one-third of humanity.
66Rv 9:16 The number of cavalry troops was20 0,000,000. I heard how many there were.9
66Rv 9:17 This was how I saw the horses in my vision£º The riders wore breastplates that had the color of fire, sapphire, and sulfur. The heads of the horses were like lions' heads, and fire, smoke, and sulfur came out of their mouths.
66Rv 9:18 By these three plagues - the fire, the smoke, and the sulfur that came out of their mouths - one-third of humanity was killed.
66Rv 9:19 For the power of these horses is in their mouths and their tails. Their tails have heads like snakes, which they use to inflict pain. 
66Rv 9:20 The rest of the people who survived these plagues did not repent from their evil actions or stop worshiping demons and idols made of gold, silver, bronze, stone, and wood, which cannot see, hear, or walk.
66Rv 9:21 They did not repent from their murders, their witchcraft, their sexual immorality, or their thefts. 
66Rv 10:1 Then I saw another powerful angel come down from heaven. He was dressed in a cloud, and there was a rainbow over his head. His face was like the sun, and his legs were like columns of fire.
66Rv 10:2 He held a small, opened scroll in his hand. Setting his right foot on the sea and his left foot on the land,
66Rv 10:3 he shouted in a loud voice as a lion roars. When he shouted, the seven thunders spoke with voices of their own.
66Rv 10:4 When the seven thunders spoke, I was going to write, but I heard a voice from heaven say, "Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and don't write it down." 
66Rv 10:5 Then the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven.
66Rv 10:6 He swore an oath by the one who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and everything in it, the earth and everything in it, and the sea and everything in it£º "There will be no more delay.
66Rv 10:7 When the time approaches for the seventh angel to blow his trumpet, God's secret plan will be fulfilled, as he had announced to his servants, the prophets."106 
66Rv 10:8 Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, "Go and take the opened scroll from the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land." 
66Rv 10:9 So I went to the angel and asked him to give me the small scroll. "Take it and eat it," he said to me. "It will turn bitter in your stomach, but it will be as sweet as honey in your mouth."
66Rv 10:10 So I took the small scroll from the angel's hand and ate it. It was as sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it, it turned bitter in my stomach.
66Rv 10:11 Then the seven thunders told me, "You must prophesy again about many peoples, nations, languages, and kings."
66Rv 11:1 Then I was given a stick like a measuring rod. I was told, "Stand up and measure the temple of God and the altar, and count those who worship there.
66Rv 11:2 But don't measure the courtyard outside the temple. Leave that out, because it is given to the nations, and they will trample the Holy City for 42 months.
66Rv 11:3 I will give my two witnesses who wear sackcloth the authority to prophesy for1 ,260 days." 
66Rv 11:4 These witnesses are the two olive trees and the two lamp stands standing in the presence of the Lord of the earth.
66Rv 11:5 And if anyone should want to hurt them, fire comes out of their mouths and burns up their enemies. If anyone wants to hurt them, he must be killed in this manner.
66Rv 11:6 These witnesses have authority to close the heavens in order to keep rain from falling while they are prophesying. They also have authority to turn bodies of water into blood and to strike the earth with any plague, as often as they desire.
66Rv 11:7 When they have finished their testimony, the beast that comes up from the bottomless pit will wage war against them, conquer them, and kill them.
66Rv 11:8 Their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that is spiritually called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified.
66Rv 11:9 For three and a half days some members of the peoples, tribes, languages, and nations will look at their dead bodies and will not allow them to be placed in a tomb.
66Rv 11:10 Those living on earth will gloat over them, celebrate, and send gifts to each other, because these two prophets had tormented those living on earth.
66Rv 11:11 But after the three and a half days, the breath of life from God entered them, and they stood on their feet. Those who watched them were terrified.
66Rv 11:12 Then the witnesses heard a loud voice from heaven calling to them, "Come up here!" So they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.
66Rv 11:13 At that moment a powerful earthquake struck. One-tenth of the city collapsed, 7,000 people were killed by the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.1111 
66Rv 11:14 The second catastrophe is over. The third catastrophe is coming very soon. 
66Rv 11:15 When the seventh angel blew his trumpet, there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The world's kingdom has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Messiah, and he will rule forever and ever."
66Rv 11:16 Then the twenty-four elders who were sitting on their thrones in God's presence fell on their faces and worshiped God.
66Rv 11:17 They said, "We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, who is and who was, because you have taken your great power and have begun to rule.
66Rv 11:18 The nations were angry, but the time for your wrath has come. It is time for the dead to be judged - to reward your servants, the prophets, the saints, and all who fear your name, both unimportant and important, and to destroy those who destroy the earth."
66Rv 11:19 Then the temple of God in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen inside his temple. There were flashes of lightning, noises, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail. 
66Rv 12:1 A spectacular sign appeared in the sky£º a woman dressed with the sun, who had the moon under her feet and a victor's crown of twelve stars on her head.
66Rv 12:2 She was pregnant and was crying out from her labor pains, the agony of giving birth.
66Rv 12:3 Then another sign appeared in the sky£º a huge red dragon with seven heads, ten horns, and seven royal crowns on its heads.
66Rv 12:4 Its tail swept away one-third of the stars in the sky and knocked them down to the earth. Then the dragon stood in front of the woman who was about to give birth so that it could devour her child when it was born.
66Rv 12:5 She gave birth to a son, a boy, who is to rule all the nations with an iron scepter. But her child was snatched away and taken to God and to his throne.
66Rv 12:6 Then the woman fled into the wilderness, where a place had been prepared for her by God so that she might be taken care of for 1,260 days.
66Rv 12:7 Then a war broke out in heaven. Michael and his angels fought with the dragon, and the dragon and its angels fought back.
66Rv 12:8 But it was not strong enough, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.
66Rv 12:9 The huge dragon was hurled down. That ancient serpent, called the Devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world, was hurled down to the earth, along with its angels.
66Rv 12:10 Then I heard a loud voice in heaven say, "Now the salvation, the power, the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Messiah have come. For the one who accuses our brothers, who accuses them day and night in the presence of our God, has been thrown out.
66Rv 12:11 Our brothers conquered him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they did not cling to their lives even in the face of death.
66Rv 12:12 So be glad, heavens, and those who live in them! How terrible it is for the earth and the sea, because the Devil has come down to you, filled with rage, knowing that his time is short!"
66Rv 12:13 When the dragon saw that it had been thrown down to the earth, it pursued the woman who had given birth to the boy.
66Rv 12:14 However, the woman was given the two wings of a large eagle so that she could fly away from the serpent to her place in the wilderness, where she could be taken care of for a time, times, and half a time.
66Rv 12:15 From its mouth the serpent spewed water like a river behind the woman in order to sweep her away with the flood.
66Rv 12:16 But the earth helped the woman by opening its mouth and swallowing the river that the dragon had spewed from its mouth.
66Rv 12:17 The dragon became angry with the woman and went away to do battle against the rest of her children, the ones who keep God's commandments and hold on to the testimony about Jesus.
66Rv 12:18 Then the dragon stood on the sand of the seashore.
66Rv 13:1 I saw a beast coming out of the sea. It had ten horns, seven heads, and ten royal crowns on its horns. On its heads were blasphemous names.
66Rv 13:2 The beast that I saw was like a leopard. Its feet were like bear's feet, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. The dragon gave it his power, his throne, and complete authority.
66Rv 13:3 One of the beast's heads looked like it had sustained a mortal wound, but its fatal wound was healed. Rapt with amazement, the whole world followed the beast
66Rv 13:4 They worshiped the dragon because it had given authority to the beast. They also worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who can fight a war with it?"
66Rv 13:5 The beast was allowed to speak arrogant and blasphemous things, and it was given authority for 42 months.
66Rv 13:6 It uttered blasphemies against God, against his name, and against his residence, that is, against those who are living in heaven.
66Rv 13:7 It was allowed to wage war against the saints and to conquer them. It was also given authority over every tribe, people, languages, and nation.
66Rv 13:8 All those living on earth will worship it, everyone whose name is not written in the Book of Life belonging to the lamb that was slaughtered from the foundation of the world. 
66Rv 13:9 Let everyone listen£º 
66Rv 13:10 If anyone is to be taken captive, into captivity he will go. If anyone is to be killed with a sword, with a sword he will be killed. Here is a call for endurance and faith of the saints£º
66Rv 13:11 I saw another beast coming up out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it talked like a dragon.
66Rv 13:12 It uses all the authority of the first beast on its behalf, and it makes the earth and those living on it worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed.
66Rv 13:13 It performs spectacular signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people.
66Rv 13:14 It deceives those living on earth with the signs that it is allowed to do on behalf of the first beast, telling them to make an image for the beast who was wounded by a sword and yet lived.
66Rv 13:15 The second beast was allowed to impart life to the image of the first beast so that the image of the beast could talk and order the execution of those who would not worship the image of the beast.
66Rv 13:16 The second beast forces all people - important and unimportant, rich and poor, free and slaves - to be marked on their right hands or on their foreheads,
66Rv 13:17 so that no one may buy or sell unless he has the mark, which is the beast's name or the number of its name.
66Rv 13:18 In this case wisdom is needed£º Let the person who has understanding calculate the total number of the beast, because it is a human total number, and the sum of the number is 666.
66Rv 14:1 Then I looked, and there was the lamb, standing on Mount Zion! With him were 144,000 people who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.
66Rv 14:2 Then I heard a sound from heaven like that of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. The sound I heard was like harpists playing on their harps.
66Rv 14:3 They were singing a new song in front of the throne, the four living creatures, and the elders. No one could learn the song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
66Rv 14:4 They have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins, and they follow the lamb wherever he goes. They have been redeemed from among humanity as the first fruits for God and the lamb.
66Rv 14:5 In their mouth no lie was found. They are blameless. 
66Rv 14:6 Then I saw another angel flying overhead with the eternal gospel to proclaim to those who live on earth - to every nation, tribe, language, and people.
66Rv 14:7 He said in a loud voice, "Fear God and give him glory, because the time for him to judge has arrived. Worship the one who made heaven and earth, the sea and springs of water." 
66Rv 14:8 Then another angel, a second one, followed him, saying, "Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen! She has made all nations drink the wine, the wrath earned for her sexual sins."
66Rv 14:9 Then another angel, a third one, followed them, saying in a loud voice, "Whoever worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or his hand
66Rv 14:10 will drink the wine of God's wrath, which has been poured undiluted into the cup of his anger. He will be tortured with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and the lamb.
66Rv 14:11 The smoke from their torture goes up forever and ever. There is no rest day or night for those who worship the beast and its image or for anyone who receives the mark of its name." 
66Rv 14:12 Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, who keep the commandments of God and hold fast to their faithfulness in Jesus£º
66Rv 14:13 I heard a voice from heaven say, "Write this£º How blessed are the dead, that is, those who die in the Lord from now on!" "Yes," says the Spirit. "Let them rest from their labors, for their actions follow them."
66Rv 14:14 Then I looked, and there was a white cloud! On the cloud sat someone who was like the Son of Man, with a gold victor's crown on his head and a sharp sickle in his hand.
66Rv 14:15 Another angel came out of the temple, crying out in a loud voice to the one who sat on the cloud, "Swing your sickle, and gather the harvest, for the hour has come to gather it, because the harvest of the earth is fully ripe."
66Rv 14:16 The one who sat on the cloud swung his sickle across the earth, and the earth was harvested.
66Rv 14:17 Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven. He, too, had a sharp sickle.
66Rv 14:18 From the altar came another angel who had authority over fire. He called out in a loud voice to the angel who had the sharp sickle, "Swing your sharp sickle, and gather the bunches of grapes from the vine of the earth, because those grapes are ripe."
66Rv 14:19 So the angel swung his sickle in the earth, gathered the grapes from the earth, and threw them into the great winepress of God's wrath.
66Rv 14:20 The wine press was trampled outside the city, and blood flowed from the wine press as high as a horse's bridle for about183 miles.
66Rv 15:1 I saw another sign in heaven. It was both spectacular and amazing. There were seven angels with the seven last plagues, with which God's wrath is completed. 
66Rv 15:2 Then I saw what looked like a sea of glass mixed with fire. Those who had conquered the beast, its image, and the number of its name were standing on the sea of glass holding God's harps in their hands.
66Rv 15:3 They sang the song of God's servant Moses and the song of the lamb£º "Your deeds are both spectacular and amazing, Lord God Almighty. Your ways are just and true, King of the nations.
66Rv 15:4 Lord, who won't fear and praise your name? For you alone are holy, and all the nations will come and worship you because your judgments have been revealed."
66Rv 15:5 After these things I looked, and the temple which is tent of testimony in heaven was open!
66Rv 15:6 The seven angels with the seven plagues came out of the temple wearing clean, shining linen with gold sashes around their chests.
66Rv 15:7 One of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven gold bowls full of the wrath of God, who lives forever and ever.
66Rv 15:8 The temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God and his power, and no one could enter the temple until the seven plagues of the seven angels came to an end.
66Rv 16:1 Then I heard a loud voice from the temple saying to the seven angels, "Go and pour the seven bowls of God's wrath on the earth."
66Rv 16:2 So the first angel went and poured his bowl on the earth. A horrible, painful sore appeared on the people who had the mark of the beast and worshiped the image. 
66Rv 16:3 The second angel poured his bowl into the sea. It became like the blood of a dead body, and every living thing in the sea died. 
66Rv 16:4 The third angel poured his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they turned into blood.
66Rv 16:5 Then I heard the angel in charge of the water say, "You are just. You are the one who is and who was, the Holy One, because you have judged these things.
66Rv 16:6 You have given them blood to drink because they spilled the blood of saints and prophets. This is what they deserve."
66Rv 16:7 Then I heard the altar reply, "Yes, Lord God Almighty, your judgments are true and just."
66Rv 16:8 The fourth angel poured his bowl on the sun, which then was allowed to burn people with fire,
66Rv 16:9 and they were burned by the fierce heat. They cursed the name of God, who has the authority over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory. 
66Rv 16:10 The fifth angel poured his bowl on the throne of the beast. Its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed on their tongues in anguish
66Rv 16:11 and cursed the God of heaven because of their pain-filled sores. But they did not repent of their behavior. 
66Rv 16:12 The sixth angel poured his bowl on the great Euphrates River. Its water was dried up to prepare the way for the kings from the east.
66Rv 16:13 Then I saw three disgusting spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon, out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth of the false prophet.
66Rv 16:14 They are demonic spirits that perform signs. They go to the kings of the whole earth and gather them for the war of the great Day of God Almighty.
66Rv 16:15 "See, I am coming like a thief. How blessed is the person who remains alert and keeps his clothes on! He won't have to go naked and let others see his shame."
66Rv 16:16 The spirits gathered the kings to the place that is called Armageddon in Hebrew.
66Rv 16:17 The seventh angel threw the contents of his bowl across the sky. A loud voice came from the throne in the temple and said, "It has happened!"
66Rv 16:18 There were flashes of lightning, noises, peals of thunder, and a powerful earthquake. There has never been such a powerful earthquake since people have been on the earth.
66Rv 16:19 The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. God remembered to give Babylon the Great the cup of wine filled with the fury of his wrath.
66Rv 16:20 Every island vanished, and the mountains could no longer be found.
66Rv 16:21 Huge hailstones, each weighing about10 0 pounds, fell from the sky on people, who cursed God because the plague of hail was so terrible.
66Rv 17:1 Then one of the seven angels who held the seven bowls came and said to me, "Come, I will show you how the notorious prostitute who sits on many waters will be judged.
66Rv 17:2 The kings of the earth committed sexual immorality with her, and those living on earth became drunk with the wine of her immorality."
66Rv 17:3 Then the angel carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness. I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was controlled by blasphemy. It had seven heads and ten horns.
66Rv 17:4 The woman wore purple and scarlet clothes and was adorned with gold, gems, and pearls. In her hand she was holding a gold cup filled with detestable things and the impurities of her immorality.
66Rv 17:5 On her forehead was written a secret name£º Babylon the Great, the Mother of Prostitutes and Detestable Things of the Earth
66Rv 17:6 I saw that the woman was drunk with the blood of the saints and the blood of the witnesses to Jesus. I was very surprised when I saw her. 
66Rv 17:7 "Why are you surprised?" The angel asked me. "I will tell you the secret of the woman and the beast with the seven heads and the ten horns that carries her.
66Rv 17:8 The beast that you saw existed once, but is no longer, and is going to crawl out of the bottomless pit and then proceed to its destruction. Those living on earth, whose names were not written in the Book of Life from the foundation of the world, will be surprised when they see the beast because it was, is no longer, and will come again.
66Rv 17:9 This calls for a mind that has wisdom. The seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is sitting. They are also seven kings.
66Rv 17:10 Five of them have fallen, one is living, and the other has not yet come. When he comes, he must remain in power for a little while.
66Rv 17:11 The beast that was and is no longer is the eighth king, but it belongs with the seven kings and goes to its destruction.
66Rv 17:12 The ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received a kingdom. They will receive authority to rule as kings with the beast for one hour.
66Rv 17:13 They have one purpose£º to give their power and authority to the beast.
66Rv 17:14 They will wage war against the lamb, but the lamb will conquer them because he is Lord of lords and King of kings. Those who are called, chosen, and faithful are with him."7
66Rv 17:15 The angel also said to me, "The bodies of water you saw, on which the prostitute is sitting, are peoples, multitudes, nations, and languages.
66Rv 17:16 The ten horns and the beast you saw will hate the prostitute. They will leave her abandoned and naked. They will eat her flesh and burn her up with fire,
66Rv 17:17 for God has placed within them a desire to carry out his purpose by uniting to give their kingdom to the beast until God's words are fulfilled.
66Rv 17:18 The woman you saw is the great city that rules over the kings of the earth."17
66Rv 18:1 After these things I saw another angel coming down from heaven. He had great authority, and the earth was made bright by his splendor.
66Rv 18:2 He cried out in a powerful voice, "Fallen! Babylon the Great has fallen! She has become a home for demons. She is a prison for every unclean spirit, a prison for every unclean bird, and a prison for every unclean and hated beast.
66Rv 18:3 For all the nations have drunk from the wine of her sexual immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality with her. The world's businesses have become rich from her luxurious excesses."
66Rv 18:4 Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my people, so that you don't participate in her sins and also suffer from her diseases.
66Rv 18:5 For her sins are piled as high as heaven, and God has remembered her crimes.
66Rv 18:6 Do to her as she herself has done, and give her double for her deeds. Mix a double drink for her in the cup she mixed.
66Rv 18:7 Just as she glorified herself and lived in luxury, inflict on her just as much torture and misery. In her heart she says, 'I am a queen on a throne, not a widow. I will never see misery.'
66Rv 18:8 For this reason, her diseases that result in death, misery, and famine will come in a single day. She will be burned up in a fire, because powerful is the Lord God who judges her."
66Rv 18:9 The kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality with her and lived in luxury with her, will cry and mourn over her when they see the smoke rising from the fire that consumes her.
66Rv 18:10 Frightened by the torture that she experiences, they will stand far away and cry out, "How terrible, how terrible it is for that great city, the powerful city Babylon, because your judgment arrived in a single hour!"
66Rv 18:11 The world's businesses cry and mourn over her, because no one buys their cargo anymore - 
66Rv 18:12 cargo of gold, silver, gems, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all articles made of ivory, all articles made of very costly wood, bronze, iron, marble,
66Rv 18:13 cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, olive oil, flour, wheat, cattle, sheep, horses, chariots, and slaves (that is, human souls) - 
66Rv 18:14 "The fruit that you crafted has abandoned you. All your dainties and your splendor are lost, and no one will ever find them again."
66Rv 18:15 Frightened by the severity of her punishment, businesses that had become rich because of her will stand at a distance, crying and mourning£º
66Rv 18:16 "How terrible, how terrible it is for the great city that was clothed in fine linen, purple, and scarlet and was adorned with gold, gems, and pearls,
66Rv 18:17 because all this wealth has been destroyed in a single hour!" Every ship's captain, everyone who traveled by ship, sailors, and everyone who made a living from the sea stood far away.
66Rv 18:18 When they saw the smoke rising from the fire that consumed her, they began to cry out, "What city was like that great city?"
66Rv 18:19 Then they threw dust on their heads and shouted while crying and mourning£º "How terrible, how terrible it is for the great city, where all who had ships at sea became rich from her wealth, because it has been destroyed in a single hour!
66Rv 18:20 Be happy about her, heaven, saints, apostles, and prophets, for God has condemned her for you!"
66Rv 18:21 Then a powerful angel picked up a stone that was like a large millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "The great city Babylon will be thrown down violently? and will never be found again.
66Rv 18:22 The sound of harpists, musicians, flutists, and trumpeters will never be heard within you again. No artisan of any trade will ever be found within you again. The sound of a millstone will never be heard within you again.
66Rv 18:23 The light from a lamp will never shine within you again. The voice of a bridegroom and bride will never be heard within you again. For your merchants were the important people of the world, and all the nations were deceived by your witchcraft.
66Rv 18:24 The blood of the world's prophets, saints, and all who had been murdered was found within her."
66Rv 19:1 After these things I heard what sounded like the loud voice of a large crowd in heaven, saying, "Hallelujah! Salvation, glory, and power belong to our God.
66Rv 19:2 His judgments are true and just. He has condemned the notorious prostitute who corrupted the world with her immorality. He has taken revenge on her for the blood of his servants."
66Rv 19:3 A second time they said, "Hallelujah! The smoke goes up from her forever and ever."
66Rv 19:4 The twenty-four elders and the four living creatures bowed down and worshiped God, who was sitting on the throne. They said, "Amen! Hallelujah!"
66Rv 19:5 A voice came from the throne, saying, "Praise our God, all who serve and fear him, from the least important to the most important."
66Rv 19:6 Then I heard what sounded like the voice of a large crowd, like the sound of raging waters, and like the sound of powerful thunderclaps, saying, "Hallelujah! The Lord our God, the Almighty, is reigning.
66Rv 19:7 Let us rejoice, be glad, and give him glory, because the marriage of the lamb has come and his bride has made herself ready.
66Rv 19:8 She has been given the privilege of wearing fine linen, dazzling and pure." (The fine linen represents the righteous deeds of the saints.)
66Rv 19:9 Then the angel said to me, "Write this£º 'How blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the lamb!'" He also told me, "These are the true words of God."
66Rv 19:10 I bowed down at his feet to worship him, but he told me, "Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you and with your brothers who rely on what Jesus is saying. Worship God, because what Jesus is saying is the spirit of prophecy!" 
66Rv 19:11 Then I saw heaven standing open, and there was a white horse! Its rider is named Faithful and True. He administers justice and wages war righteously.
66Rv 19:12 His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many royal crowns. He has a name written on him that nobody knows except himself.
66Rv 19:13 He is dressed in a robe dipped in blood, and his name is called the Word of God.
66Rv 19:14 The armies of heaven, wearing fine linen, white and pure, follow him on white horses.
66Rv 19:15 A sharp sword comes out of his mouth to strike down the nations. He will rule them with an iron rod and tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God Almighty.
66Rv 19:16 On his robe and his thigh he has a name written£º King of Kings and Lord of Lords
66Rv 19:17 Then I saw an angel standing in the sun. He cried out in a loud voice to all the birds flying overhead, "Come! Gather for the great supper of God.
66Rv 19:18 Eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of commanders, the flesh of warriors, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all people, both free and slaves, both unimportant and important."19
66Rv 19:19 Then I saw the beast, the kings of the earth, and their armies gathered to wage war against the rider on the horse and his army.
66Rv 19:20 The beast was captured, along with the false prophet who had performed signs on its behalf. By these signs the false prophet had deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and worshiped its image. Both of them were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.
66Rv 19:21 The rest were killed by the sword that belonged to the rider on the horse and that came from his mouth, and all the birds gorged themselves with their flesh.
66Rv 20:1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding the key to the bottomless pit, with a large chain in his hand.
66Rv 20:2 He captured the dragon, that ancient serpent, also known as the devil and Satan, and tied him up for a thousand years.
66Rv 20:3 He threw him into the bottomless pit, locked it, and sealed it over him to keep him from deceiving the nations anymore until the thousand years were over. After that he must be set free for a little while. 
66Rv 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and those who sat on them were given authority to judge. I also saw the souls of those who had been beheaded because of their testimony about Jesus and because of the word of God. They had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or hands. They came back to life and ruled with the Messiah for a thousand years.
66Rv 20:5 The rest of the dead did not come back to life until the thousand years were over. This is the first resurrection.
66Rv 20:6 How blessed and holy are those who participate in the first resurrection! The second death has no power over them. They will be priests of God and the Messiah, and will rule with him for a thousand years. 
66Rv 20:7 When the thousand years are over, Satan will be freed from his prison.
66Rv 20:8 He will go out to deceive Gog and Magog, the nations at the four corners of the earth, and gather them for war. They are as numerous as the sands of the seashore.
66Rv 20:9 They marched over the broad expanse of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city. Fire came from God out of heaven and burned them up,
66Rv 20:10 and the devil who deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur, where the beast and the false prophet were. They will be tortured day and night forever and ever. 
66Rv 20:11 Then I saw a large, white throne and the one who was sitting on it. The earth and the heavens fled from his presence, and no place was found for them.
66Rv 20:12 I saw the dead, both unimportant and important, standing in front of the throne, and books were open. Another book was opened - the Book of Life. The dead were judged according to their actions, as recorded in the books.
66Rv 20:13 The sea gave up the dead that were in it, and Death and Hades gave up the dead that were in them, and all were judged according to their actions.
66Rv 20:14 Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. (This is the second death - the lake of fire.)
66Rv 20:15 Anyone whose name was not found written in the Book of Life was thrown into the lake of fire. 
66Rv 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, because the first heaven and the first earth had disappeared, and the sea was gone.
66Rv 21:2 I also saw the holy city, New Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven, prepared like a bride adorned for her husband.
66Rv 21:3 I heard a loud voice from the throne say, "See, the tabernacle of God is among humans! He will make his home with them, and they will be his people. God himself will be with them, and he will be their God.
66Rv 21:4 He will wipe every tear from their eyes. There won't be death anymore. There won't be any grief, crying, or pain, because the first things have disappeared." 
66Rv 21:5 The one sitting on the throne said, "See, I am making all things new!"He said, "Write this£º 'These words are trustworthy and true.'" 
66Rv 21:6 Then he said to me, "It has happened! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. I will freely give a drink from the spring of the water of life to the one who is thirsty.
66Rv 21:7 The person who conquers will inherit these things. I will be his God, and he will be my son.
66Rv 21:8 But people who are cowardly, unfaithful, detestable, murderers, sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars will find themselves in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur. This is the second death." 
66Rv 21:9 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues came to me and said, "Come! I will show you the bride, the wife of the lamb."
66Rv 21:10 He carried me away in the Spirit to a large, high mountain and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down from God out of heaven.
66Rv 21:11 The glory of God was its radiance, and its light was like a valuable gem, like jasper, as clear as crystal.
66Rv 21:12 It had a large, high wall with twelve gates. Twelve angels were at the gates, and the names of the twelve tribes of Israel were written on the gates.
66Rv 21:13 There were three gates on the east, three gates on the north, three gates on the south, and three gates on the west.
66Rv 21:14 The wall of the city had twelve foundations, and the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the lamb were written on them.21
66Rv 21:15 The angel who was talking to me had a gold measuring rod to measure the city, its gates, and its walls.
66Rv 21:16 The city was square£º its length was the same as its width. He measured the city with his rod, and it was about1 ,374 miles long. Its length, width, and height were the same.
66Rv 21:17 He also measured its wall. According to the human measurement that the angel was using, it was 242 feet.
66Rv 21:18 Its wall was made of jasper. The city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass.
66Rv 21:19 The foundations of the city wall were decorated with all kinds of gems£º The first foundation was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,
66Rv 21:20 the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, and the twelfth amethyst.
66Rv 21:21 The twelve gates were twelve pearls, and each gate was made of a single pearl. The street of the city was made of pure gold, as clear as glass. 
66Rv 21:22 I saw no temple in it, because the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are its temple.
66Rv 21:23 The city doesn't need any sun or moon to give it light, because the glory of God gave it light, and the lamb was its lamp.
66Rv 21:24 The nations will walk in its light, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it.
66Rv 21:25 Its gates will never be shut at the end of the day - because there will be no night there.
66Rv 21:26 People will bring the glory and wealth of the nations into it.
66Rv 21:27 Nothing unclean, or anyone who does anything detestable, and no one who tells lies will ever enter it. Only those whose names are written in the lamb's Book of Life will enter it.
66Rv 22:1 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, as clear as crystal. It was flowing from the throne of God and the lamb.
66Rv 22:2 Between the city street and the river, the tree of life was visible from each side. It produced twelve kinds of fruit, each month having its own fruit. The leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.
66Rv 22:3 There will no longer be any curse. The throne of God and the lamb will be in the city. His servants will worship him
66Rv 22:4 and see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
66Rv 22:5 There will be no more night, and they will not need any light from lamps or the sun because the Lord God will shine on them. They will rule forever and ever. 
66Rv 22:6 He said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. The Lord God of the spirits and of the prophets has sent his messenger to show his servants the things that must happen soon." 
66Rv 22:7 "See! I am coming soon! How blessed is the person who keeps the words of the prophecy in this book!" 
66Rv 22:8 I, John, heard and saw these things. When I had heard and seen them, I bowed down to worship at the feet of the angel who had been showing me these things.
66Rv 22:9 But he told me, "Don't do that! I am a fellow servant with you, your brothers the prophets, and those who keep the words in this book. Worship God!" 
66Rv 22:10 Then he said to me, "Don't seal up the words of the prophecy in this book, because the time is near.
66Rv 22:11 Let the one who does what is evil continue to do evil, and let the filthy person continue to be filthy, and the righteous person continue to do what is right, and the holy person continue to be holy." 
66Rv 22:12 "See! I am coming soon! My reward is with me to repay everyone according to his action.
66Rv 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end.
66Rv 22:14 "How blessed are those who wash their robes so that they may have the right to the tree of life and may go through the gates into the city!
66Rv 22:15 Outside are dogs, sorcerers, immoral people, murderers, idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
66Rv 22:16 "I, Jesus, have sent my angel to give this testimony to you for the churches. I am the root and descendent of David, the bright morning star."
66Rv 22:17 The Spirit and the bride say, "Come!" Let everyone who hears this say, "Come!" Let everyone who is thirsty come! Let anyone who wants the water of life take it as a gift!
66Rv 22:18 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy in this book£º If anyone adds anything to them, God will strike him with the plagues that are written in this book.
66Rv 22:19 If anyone takes away any words from the book of this prophecy, God will take away his portion of the tree of life and the holy city that are described in this book.
66Rv 22:20 The one who is testifying to these things says, "Yes, I am coming soon!" Amen! Come, Lord Jesus!
66Rv 22:21 May the grace of the Lord Jesus be with all the saints. Amen.
