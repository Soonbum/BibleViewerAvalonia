40Mt 1:1 This is a record of the life of Jesus the Messiah, the son of David, the son of Abraham.
40Mt 1:2 Abraham fathered Isaac, Isaac fathered Jacob, and Jacob fathered Judah and his brothers.
40Mt 1:3 Judah fathered Perez and Zerah by Tamar, Perez fathered Hezron, Hezron fathered Aram,
40Mt 1:4 Aram fathered Amminadab, Amminadab fathered Nahshon, and Nahshon fathered Salmon.
40Mt 1:5 Salmon fathered Boaz by Rahab, Boaz fathered Obed by Ruth, Obed fathered Jesse,
40Mt 1:6 and Jesse fathered King David. David fathered Solomon by the wife of Uriah,
40Mt 1:7 Solomon fathered Rehoboam, Rehoboam fathered Abijah, Abijah fathered Asaph,
40Mt 1:8 Asaph fathered Jehoshaphat, Jehoshaphat fathered Joram, Joram fathered Uzziah,
40Mt 1:9 Uzziah fathered Jotham, Jotham fathered Ahaz, Ahaz fathered Hezekiah,
40Mt 1:10 Hezekiah fathered Manasseh, Manasseh fathered Amos, and Amos fathered Josiah.
40Mt 1:11 Josiah fathered Jechoniah and his brothers at the time of the deportation to Babylon.
40Mt 1:12 After the deportation to Babylon, Jechoniah fathered Salathiel, Salathiel fathered Zerubbabel,
40Mt 1:13 Zerubbabel fathered Abiud, Abiud fathered Eliakim, Eliakim fathered Azor,
40Mt 1:14 Azor fathered Zadok, Zadok fathered Achim, Achim fathered Eliud,
40Mt 1:15 Eliud fathered Eleazar, Eleazar fathered Matthan, and Matthan fathered Jacob.
40Mt 1:16 Jacob fathered Joseph, the husband of Mary, who was the mother of Jesus, who is called the Messiah.
40Mt 1:17 So all the generations from Abraham to David totaled fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon totaled fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Messiah there were fourteen generations.1
40Mt 1:18 Now the birth of Jesus the Messiah happened in this way. When his mother Mary was engaged to Joseph, before they lived together she was discovered to be pregnant by the Holy Spirit.
40Mt 1:19 Her husband Joseph, being a righteous man and unwilling to disgrace her, decided to divorce her secretly.1
40Mt 1:20 After he had thought about it, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream. "Joseph, son of David," he said, "don't be afraid to take Mary as your wife, because what has been conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit.
40Mt 1:21 She will give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus, because he is the one who will save his people from their sins."1
40Mt 1:22 Now all this happened to fulfill what was declared by the Lord through the prophet when he said,
40Mt 1:23 "See, a virgin will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and they will name him Immanuel," which means, "God with us."
40Mt 1:24 When Joseph got up from his sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord had commanded him and took Mary as his wife.
40Mt 1:25 He did not have marital relations with her until she had given birth to a son; and he named him Jesus.
40Mt 2:1 After Jesus had been born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of King Herod, wise men from the east arrived in Jerusalem
40Mt 2:2 and asked, "Where is the one who was born king of the Jews? We saw his star in the east and have come to worship him."
40Mt 2:3 When King Herod heard this, he was disturbed, as was all of Jerusalem.
40Mt 2:4 He called together all the high priests and scribes of the people and asked them where the Messiah was to be born.
40Mt 2:5 They told him, "In Bethlehem of Judea, because that is what was written by the prophet£º
40Mt 2:6 'O Bethlehem in the land of Judah, you are by no means least among the rulers of Judah, because from you will come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.'"
40Mt 2:7 Then Herod secretly called together the wise men, found out from them the time the star had appeared,
40Mt 2:8 and sent them to Bethlehem. He told them, "As you go, search carefully for the child. When you find him, tell me so that I, too, may go and worship him."
40Mt 2:9 After listening to the king, they set out, and the star they had seen in the east went ahead of them until it came and stopped over the place where the child was.
40Mt 2:10 When they saw the star, they were ecstatic with joy.
40Mt 2:11 After they went into the house and saw the child with his mother Mary, they fell down and worshiped him. Then they opened their treasure sacks and offered him gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh.
40Mt 2:12 Having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they left for their own country by a different road.
40Mt 2:13 After they had gone, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream. "Get up, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt," he said. "Stay there until I tell you, because Herod intends to search for the child and kill him."
40Mt 2:14 So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and left at night for Egypt.
40Mt 2:15 He stayed there until Herod's death in order to fulfill what was declared by the Lord through the prophet when he said, "Out of Egypt I called my Son."
40Mt 2:16 Herod flew into a rage when he learned that he had been tricked by the wise men, so he ordered the execution of all the male children in Bethlehem and all its neighboring regions, who were two years old and younger, according to the time that he had determined from the wise men.
40Mt 2:17 Then what was declared by the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said,216
40Mt 2:18 "A voice was heard in Ramah£º wailing and great mourning. Rachel was crying for her children. She refused to be comforted, because they no longer existed."
40Mt 2:19 But after Herod died, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt.
40Mt 2:20 "Get up," he said. "Take the child and his mother, and go to the land of Israel, because those who were trying to kill the child are dead."
40Mt 2:21 So Joseph got up, took the child and his mother, and went into the land of Israel.
40Mt 2:22 But when he heard that Archelaus was ruling over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there. After having been warned in a dream, he left for the region of Galilee
40Mt 2:23 and came and settled in a town called Nazareth in order to fulfill what was said by the prophets£º "He will be called a Nazarene."
40Mt 3:1 About this time, John the Baptist appeared, preaching in the Judean wilderness
40Mt 3:2 and saying, "Repent, because the kingdom of heaven is near!"
40Mt 3:3 He was the one the prophet Isaiah was referring to when he said, "He is a voice calling out in the wilderness£º 'Prepare the way for the Lord! Make his paths straight!'"
40Mt 3:4 John had clothing made of camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist. His diet consisted of locusts and wild honey.
40Mt 3:5 Then the people of Jerusalem, all Judea, and the entire region along the Jordan began flocking to him,
40Mt 3:6 being baptized by him in the Jordan River while they confessed their sins.3
40Mt 3:7 But when John saw many Pharisees and Sadducees coming to where he was baptizing, he said to them, "You children of serpents! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath - 
40Mt 3:8 Produce fruit that is consistent with repentance!
40Mt 3:9 Don't think you can say to yourselves, 'We have father Abraham!' because I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones!
40Mt 3:10 The ax already lies against the roots of the trees. So every tree that isn't producing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.
40Mt 3:11 I am baptizing you with water as a token of repentance, but the one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to carry his sandals. It is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
40Mt 3:12 His winnowing fork is in his hand. He will clean up his threshing floor and gather his grain into the barn, but he will burn the chaff with inextinguishable fire." 
40Mt 3:13 Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to be baptized by John.
40Mt 3:14 But John tried to stop him, saying, "I need to be baptized by you, and are you coming to me?"
40Mt 3:15 But Jesus answered him, "Let it be this way for now, because this is the proper way for us to fulfill all righteousness."At this, he permitted him to be baptized.
40Mt 3:16 When Jesus had been baptized, he immediately came up out of the water. Suddenly the heavens opened up for him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him.
40Mt 3:17 Then a voice from heaven said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him!"
40Mt 4:1 After this, Jesus was led by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil.
40Mt 4:2 After fasting for 40 days and 40 nights, he finally became hungry.
40Mt 4:3 Then the tempter came. "Since you are the Son of God," he said, "tell these stones to become loaves of bread."
40Mt 4:4 But he answered, "It is written, 'One must not live on bread alone, but on every word coming out of the mouth of God.'"
40Mt 4:5 Then the devil took him to the Holy City and had him stand on the highest point of the temple.
40Mt 4:6 He said to Jesus, "Since you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, because it is written, 'God will put his angels in charge of you,' and 'With their hands they will hold you up, so that you will never hit your foot against a rock.'"
40Mt 4:7 Jesus responded to him, "It is also written, 'You must not tempt the Lord your God.'"
40Mt 4:8 Once more the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world, along with their splendor.
40Mt 4:9 He said to Jesus, "I will give you all these things if you will bow down and worship me!"
40Mt 4:10 Then Jesus said to him, "Go away, Satan! Because it is written, 'You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him.'"
40Mt 4:11 So the devil left him, and angels came and began ministering to him. 
40Mt 4:12 Now when Jesus heard that John had been arrested, he went back to Galilee.
40Mt 4:13 He left Nazareth and went and settled in Capernaum by the sea, in the regions of Zebulun and Naphtali,
40Mt 4:14 in order to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,
40Mt 4:15 "O Land of Zebulun and Land of Naphtali, on the road to the sea, across the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles!
40Mt 4:16 The people living in darkness have seen a great light, and for those living in the land and shadow of death, a light has risen."
40Mt 4:17 From then on, Jesus began to preach and to say, "Repent, because the kingdom of heaven is near!" 
40Mt 4:18 While Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers - Simon (also called Peter) and his brother Andrew. They were casting a net into the sea, because they were fishermen.
40Mt 4:19 "Follow me," he told them, "and I will make you fishers of people!"
40Mt 4:20 So at once they left their nets and followed him.
40Mt 4:21 Going on from there he saw two other brothers - James son of Zebedee and his brother John. They were in a boat with their father Zebedee repairing their nets. When he called them,
40Mt 4:22 they immediately left the boat and their father and followed him.18
40Mt 4:23 Then he went throughout Galilee, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness among the people.
40Mt 4:24 His fame spread throughout Syria, and people brought to him everyone who was sick - those afflicted with various diseases and pains, the demon-possessed, the epileptics, and the paralyzed - and he healed them.
40Mt 4:25 Large crowds from Galilee, the Decapolis, Jerusalem, Judea, and from across the Jordan followed him.4
40Mt 5:1 When Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on the hill. After taking his seat, his disciples came to him,
40Mt 5:2 and he began to teach them, saying£º
40Mt 5:3 "How blessed are those who are destitute in spirit, because the kingdom of heaven belongs to them!
40Mt 5:4 "How blessed are those who mourn, because it is they who will be comforted!
40Mt 5:5 "How blessed are those who are humble, because it is they who will inherit the earth!
40Mt 5:6 "How blessed are those who are hungry and thirsty for righteousness, because it is they who will be satisfied!
40Mt 5:7 "How blessed are those who are merciful, because it is they who will receive mercy!
40Mt 5:8 "How blessed are those who are pure in heart, because it is they who will see God!
40Mt 5:9 "How blessed are those who make peace, because it is they who will be called God's children!
40Mt 5:10 "How blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, because the kingdom of heaven belongs to them!
40Mt 5:11 "How blessed are you whenever people insult you, persecute you, and say all sorts of evil things against you falsely because of me!
40Mt 5:12 Rejoice and be extremely glad, because your reward in heaven is great! That's how they persecuted the prophets who came before you." 
40Mt 5:13 "You are the salt of the world. But if the salt should lose its taste, how can it be made salty again? It's good for nothing but to be thrown out and trampled on by people.
40Mt 5:14 "You are the light of the world. A city located on a hill can't be hidden.
40Mt 5:15 People don't light a lamp and put it under a basket but on a lamp stand, and it gives light to everyone in the house.
40Mt 5:16 In the same way, let your light shine before people in such a way that they will see your good actions and glorify your Father in heaven." 
40Mt 5:17 "Do not think that I came to destroy the Law or the Prophets. I didn't come to destroy them, but to fulfill them,
40Mt 5:18 because I tell you with certainty that until heaven and earth disappear, not one letter or one stroke of a letter will disappear from the Law until everything has been accomplished.
40Mt 5:19 So whoever sets aside one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven. But whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven
40Mt 5:20 because I tell you, unless your righteousness greatly exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven!" 
40Mt 5:21 "You have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago, 'You must not murder,' and 'Whoever murders will be subject to punishment.'
40Mt 5:22 But I say to you, anyone who is angry with his brother without a cause will be subject to punishment. And whoever says to his brother 'Raka!' will be subject to the Council. And whoever says 'You fool!' will be subject to hell fire.
40Mt 5:23 "So if you are presenting your gift at the altar and remember there that your brother has something against you,
40Mt 5:24 leave your gift there before the altar and first go and be reconciled to your brother. Then come and offer your gift.
40Mt 5:25 Come to terms quickly with your opponent while you are on the way to court, or your opponent may hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you will be thrown into prison.
40Mt 5:26 I tell you with certainty, you will not get out of there until you pay back the last dollar!"25
40Mt 5:27 "You have heard that it was said, 'You must not commit adultery.'
40Mt 5:28 But I say to you, anyone who stares at a woman with lust for her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.
40Mt 5:29 So if your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to lose one of your body parts than to have your whole body thrown into hell.
40Mt 5:30 And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away from you. It is better for you to lose one of your body parts than to have your whole body go into hell."27
40Mt 5:31 "It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife must give her a written notice of divorce.'
40Mt 5:32 But I say to you, any man who divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery." 
40Mt 5:33 "Again, you have heard that it was said to those who lived long ago, 'You must not swear an oath falsely,' but 'You must fulfill your oaths to the Lord.'
40Mt 5:34 But I tell you not to swear at all, neither by heaven, because it is God's throne,
40Mt 5:35 nor by the earth, because it is his footstool, nor by Jerusalem, because it is the city of the Great King.
40Mt 5:36 Nor should you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black.
40Mt 5:37 Instead, let your message be 'Yes' for 'Yes' and 'No' for 'No.' Anything more than that comes from the evil one." 
40Mt 5:38 "You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'
40Mt 5:39 But I tell you not to resist an evildoer. On the contrary, whoever slaps you on the right cheek, turn the other to him as well.
40Mt 5:40 If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat as well.
40Mt 5:41 And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go two with him.
40Mt 5:42 Give to the person who asks you for something, and do not turn away from the person who wants to borrow something from you." 
40Mt 5:43 "You have heard that it was said, 'You must love your neighbor' and hate your enemy.
40Mt 5:44 But I say to you, love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you,
40Mt 5:45 so that you will become children of your Father in heaven, because he makes his sun rise on both evil and good people, and he lets rain fall on the righteous and the unrighteous.
40Mt 5:46 If you love those who love you, what reward will you have? Even the tax collectors do the same, don't they - 
40Mt 5:47 And if you greet only your relatives, that's no great thing you're doing, is it? Even the gentiles do the same, don't they - 
40Mt 5:48 So be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect."547
40Mt 6:1 "Be careful not to practice your righteousness in front of people in order to be noticed by them. If you do, you will have no reward from your Father in heaven.
40Mt 6:2 So whenever you give to the poor, don't blow a trumpet before you like the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets so that they will be praised by people. I tell you with certainty, they have their full reward!
40Mt 6:3 But when you give to the poor, don't let your left hand know what your right hand is doing,
40Mt 6:4 so that your giving may be done in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you."2
40Mt 6:5 "And whenever you pray, don't be like the hypocrites who love to stand in the synagogues and on the street corners so that they will be seen by people. I tell you with certainty, they have their full reward!
40Mt 6:6 But whenever you pray, go into your room, close the door, and pray to your Father who is hidden. And your Father who sees from the hidden place will reward you.
40Mt 6:7 "When you are praying, don't say meaningless things like the gentiles do, because they think they will be heard by being so wordy.
40Mt 6:8 Don't be like them, because your Father knows what you need before you ask him.
40Mt 6:9 "Therefore, this is how you should pray£º 'Our Father in heaven, may your name be kept holy.
40Mt 6:10 May your kingdom come. May your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven.
40Mt 6:11 Give us today our daily bread,
40Mt 6:12 and forgive us our sins, as we have forgiven those who have sinned against us.
40Mt 6:13 And never bring us into temptation, but deliver us from the evil one.'
40Mt 6:14 Because if you forgive people their offenses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you.
40Mt 6:15 But if you do not forgive people their offenses, your Father will not forgive your offenses." 
40Mt 6:16 "Whenever you fast, don't be gloomy like the hypocrites, because they put on sad faces to show others they are fasting. I tell you with certainty, they have their full reward!
40Mt 6:17 But when you fast, put oil on your head and wash your face,
40Mt 6:18 so that your fasting will not be noticed by others but by your Father who is in the hidden place. And your Father who watches from the hidden place will reward you."
40Mt 6:19 "Stop storing up treasures for yourselves on earth, where moths and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal.
40Mt 6:20 But keep on storing up treasures for yourselves in heaven, where moths and rust do not destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal,
40Mt 6:21 because where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
40Mt 6:22 "The eye is the lamp of the body. So if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light.
40Mt 6:23 But if your eye is evil, your whole body will be full of darkness. Therefore, if the light within you has turned into darkness, how great is that darkness!"
40Mt 6:24 "No one can serve two masters, because either he will hate one and love the other, or be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and riches!"
40Mt 6:25 "That's why I'm telling you to stop worrying about your life - what you will eat or what you will drink - or about your body - what you will wear. Life is more than food, isn't it, and the body more than clothing - 
40Mt 6:26 Look at the birds in the sky. They don't plant or harvest or gather food into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. You are more valuable than they are, aren't you - 
40Mt 6:27 Can any of you add a single hour to the length of your life by worrying - 
40Mt 6:28 And why do you worry about clothes? Consider the lilies in the field and how they grow. They don't work or spin yarn,
40Mt 6:29 but I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them.
40Mt 6:30 Now if that is the way God clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today and thrown into an oven tomorrow, won't he clothe you much better - you who have little faith - 266
40Mt 6:31 "So don't ever worry by saying, 'What are we going to eat?' or 'What are we going to drink?' or 'What are we going to wear?'
40Mt 6:32 because it is the gentiles who are eager for all those things. Surely your heavenly Father knows that you need all of them!
40Mt 6:33 But first be concerned about God's kingdom and his righteousness, and all of these things will be provided for you as well.
40Mt 6:34 So never worry about tomorrow, because tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own."
40Mt 7:1 "Stop judging, so that you won't be judged,
40Mt 7:2 because the way that you judge others will be the way that you will be judged, and you will be evaluated by the standard with which you evaluate others.
40Mt 7:3 "Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye but fail to notice the beam in your own eye - 
40Mt 7:4 Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when the beam is in your own eye - 
40Mt 7:5 You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you will see clearly enough to remove the speck from your brother's eye."
40Mt 7:6 "Never give what is holy to dogs or throw your pearls before pigs. Otherwise, they will trample them with their feet and then turn around and attack you." 
40Mt 7:7 "Keep asking, and it will be given to you. Keep searching, and you will find. Keep knocking, and the door will be opened for you.
40Mt 7:8 Because everyone who keeps asking will receive, and the person who keeps searching will find, and the person who keeps knocking will have the door opened. 
40Mt 7:9 "There isn't a person among you who would give his son a stone if he asked for bread, is there - 
40Mt 7:10 Or if he asks for a fish, he wouldn't give him a snake, would he - 
40Mt 7:11 So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father in heaven give good things to those who keep on asking him!
40Mt 7:12 Therefore, whatever you want people to do for you, do the same for them, because this summarizes the Law and the Prophets." 
40Mt 7:13 "Go in through the narrow gate, because the gate is wide and the road is spacious that leads to destruction, and many people are entering by it.
40Mt 7:14 How narrow is the gate and how constricted is the road that leads to life, and there aren't many people who find it!"
40Mt 7:15 "Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are savage wolves.
40Mt 7:16 You will know them by their fruit. Grapes aren't gathered from thorns, or figs from thistles, are they - 
40Mt 7:17 In the same way, every good tree produces good fruit, but a rotten tree produces bad fruit.
40Mt 7:18 A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, and a rotten tree cannot produce good fruit.
40Mt 7:19 Every tree that doesn't produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire.
40Mt 7:20 So by their fruit you will know them."
40Mt 7:21 "Not everyone who keeps saying to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will get into the kingdom of heaven, but only the person who keeps doing the will of my Father in heaven.
40Mt 7:22 Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, we prophesied in your name, drove out demons in your name, and performed many miracles in your name, didn't we?'
40Mt 7:23 Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Get away from me, you evildoers!'"21
40Mt 7:24 "Therefore, everyone who listens to these messages of mine and puts them into practice is like a wise man who built his house on a rock.
40Mt 7:25 The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, but it did not collapse because its foundation was on the rock.7
40Mt 7:26 "Everyone who keeps on hearing these messages of mine and never puts them into practice is like a foolish man who built his house on sand.
40Mt 7:27 The rain fell, the floods came, and the winds blew and battered that house, and it collapsed, and its collapse was total."
40Mt 7:28 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, the crowds were utterly amazed at his teaching,
40Mt 7:29 because he was teaching them like a person who had authority, and not like their scribes. 
40Mt 8:1 When Jesus came down from the hillside, large crowds followed him.
40Mt 8:2 Suddenly a leper came up to him, fell down before him, and said, "Sir, if you want to, you can make me clean."
40Mt 8:3 So Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said, "I do want to. Be clean!" And instantly his leprosy was made clean.
40Mt 8:4 Then Jesus said to him, "See to it that you don't speak to anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest, and then offer the sacrifice that Moses commanded as proof to the authorities."
40Mt 8:5 When Jesus returned to Capernaum, a centurion came up to him and begged him repeatedly,
40Mt 8:6 "Sir, my servant is lying at home paralyzed and in terrible pain."
40Mt 8:7 Jesus said to him, "I will come and heal him."
40Mt 8:8 The centurion replied, "Sir, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof. But just say the word, and my servant will be healed,
40Mt 8:9 because I, too, am a man under authority and I have soldiers under me. I say to one of them 'Go' and he goes, to another 'Come' and he comes, and to my servant 'Do this' and he does it."
40Mt 8:10 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed and said to those who were following him, "I tell you with certainty, not even in Israel have I found this kind of faith!
40Mt 8:11 I tell you, many will come from east and west and will feast with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 8:12 But the unfaithful heirs of that kingdom will be thrown into the darkness outside. In that place there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth."
40Mt 8:13 "Go," Jesus said to the centurion, "and it will be done for you, just as you have believed." And his servant was healed that very hour.
40Mt 8:14 When Jesus went into Peter's house, he saw Peter's mother-in-law lying in bed, sick with a fever.
40Mt 8:15 He touched her hand, and the fever left her. Then she got up and began serving him.
40Mt 8:16 When evening came, people brought to him many who were possessed by demons. He drove out the spirits by speaking a command and healed everyone who was sick.
40Mt 8:17 This was to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said, "It was he who took our illnesses away and removed our diseases."
40Mt 8:18 When Jesus saw the large crowds around him, he gave orders to cross to the other side of the Sea of Galilee.
40Mt 8:19 Just then, a scribe came up and said to him, "Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go." 
40Mt 8:20 Jesus told him, "Foxes have holes and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to rest."
40Mt 8:21 Then another of his disciples said to him, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father." 
40Mt 8:22 But Jesus told him, "Follow me, and let the dead bury their own dead."
40Mt 8:23 When Jesus got into the boat, his disciples went with him.
40Mt 8:24 Suddenly a violent storm came up on the sea, so that the boat began to be swamped by the waves. Yet Jesus kept sleeping.
40Mt 8:25 They went to him and woke him up. "Lord!" they cried, "save us! We're going to die!"
40Mt 8:26 He asked them, "Why are you afraid, you who have little faith?" Then he got up and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. 
40Mt 8:27 The men were amazed. "What kind of man is this?" they asked. "Even the winds and the sea obey him!"
40Mt 8:28 When Jesus arrived on the other side in the region of the Gerasenes, two demon-possessed men met him as they were coming out of the tombs. They were so violent that no one could travel on that road.
40Mt 8:29 Suddenly they screamed, "What do you want with us, Son of God? Did you come here to torture us before the proper time?"
40Mt 8:30 Now a large herd of pigs was grazing some distance away from them.
40Mt 8:31 So the demons began to plead with Jesus, saying, "If you drive us out, send us into that herd of pigs."
40Mt 8:32 He said to them, "Go," and they came out and went into the pigs. Suddenly, the whole herd rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned in the water.
40Mt 8:33 Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs ran away, they came into the city and reported everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men.
40Mt 8:34 Then the whole city went out to meet Jesus, and as soon as they saw him, they begged him to leave their region. 
40Mt 9:1 After getting into a boat, Jesus crossed to the other side and came to his own city.
40Mt 9:2 All at once some people brought him a paralyzed man lying on a stretcher. When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Be courageous, son! Your sins are forgiven." 
40Mt 9:3 Then some of the scribes said to themselves, "This fellow is blaspheming!"
40Mt 9:4 But Jesus, knowing what they were thinking, replied, "Why do you have such evil thoughts in your hearts - 
40Mt 9:5 Which is easier£º to say 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk' - 
40Mt 9:6 But so you will know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins¡¦" he said to the paralyzed man, "Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home!"
40Mt 9:7 So the man got up and went home.
40Mt 9:8 When the crowds saw this, they became frightened and glorified God for giving such authority to humans.
40Mt 9:9 As Jesus went on from there, he saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's desk and said to him, "Follow me." So he got up and followed him. 
40Mt 9:10 While he was having dinner at Matthew's home, many tax collectors and sinners arrived and began eating with Jesus and his disciples.
40Mt 9:11 The Pharisees saw this and asked his disciples, "Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners?" 
40Mt 9:12 When Jesus heard that, he said, "Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick people do.
40Mt 9:13 Go and learn what this means£º 'I want mercy and not sacrifice,' because I did not come to call righteous people, but sinners." 
40Mt 9:14 Then John's disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Why do we and the Pharisees fast often, but your disciples don't fast?"
40Mt 9:15 Jesus asked them, "The wedding guests can't mourn as long as the groom is with them, can they? But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast." 
40Mt 9:16 "No one patches an old garment with a piece of unshrunk cloth, because the patch pulls away from the garment, and a worse tear results.
40Mt 9:17 Nor do people pour new wine into old wineskins. If they do, the skins will burst, the wine will spill out, and the skins will be ruined. Instead, they pour new wine into fresh wineskins, and both are preserved."
40Mt 9:18 While Jesus was telling them these things, an official came up and fell down before him. "My daughter has just died," he said. "But come and lay your hand on her, and she will live."
40Mt 9:19 So Jesus got up and followed him, along with his disciples.
40Mt 9:20 Just then a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years came up behind him and touched the tassel of his garment,
40Mt 9:21 because she had been saying to herself, "If I just touch his robe, I will get well."
40Mt 9:22 When Jesus turned and saw her, he said, "Be courageous, daughter! Your faith has made you well." And from that very hour the woman was well. 
40Mt 9:23 When Jesus came to the official's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion,
40Mt 9:24 he said, "Go away! The young lady hasn't died but is sleeping." But they ridiculed him with laughter.
40Mt 9:25 When the crowd had been driven outside, he went in, took her by the hand, and the young lady got up.
40Mt 9:26 The news of this spread throughout that land.
40Mt 9:27 As Jesus was traveling on from there, two blind men followed him, shouting, "Have mercy on us, Son of David!"
40Mt 9:28 When he had gone into the house, the blind men came to him. Jesus asked them, "Do you believe I can do this?" They said to him, "Yes, Lord!" 
40Mt 9:29 Then he touched their eyes and said, "According to your faith, let it be done for you!"
40Mt 9:30 And their eyes were opened. Then Jesus sternly told them, "See to it that nobody knows about this."
40Mt 9:31 But they went out and spread the news about him throughout that region.30 
40Mt 9:32 As the men were going out, a man who couldn't talk because he was demon-possessed was brought to him.
40Mt 9:33 As soon as the demon had been driven out, the man began to speak. The crowds were amazed and said, "Nothing like this has ever been seen in Israel!"
40Mt 9:34 But the Pharisees kept saying, "He drives out demons by the ruler of demons."9
40Mt 9:35 Then Jesus began traveling throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues, proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom, and healing every disease and every illness.
40Mt 9:36 When he saw the crowds, he was deeply moved with compassion for them, because they were troubled and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. 
40Mt 9:37 Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is vast, but the workers are few.
40Mt 9:38 So ask the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest." 
40Mt 10:1 Then Jesus called his twelve disciples to him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they could drive them out and heal every disease and every illness.
40Mt 10:2 These are the names of the twelve apostles£º first, Simon (who is called Peter) and his brother Andrew; James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John;
40Mt 10:3 Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James, the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus;
40Mt 10:4 Simon the Cananaean and Judas Iscariot, who later betrayed Jesus.
40Mt 10:5 These were the twelve disciples whom Jesus sent out after he had given them these instructions£º "Don't turn on to the road that leads to the gentiles, and don't enter Samaritan towns.
40Mt 10:6 Instead, go to the lost sheep of the nation of Israel.
40Mt 10:7 As you go, make this announcement£º 'The kingdom of heaven is near!'
40Mt 10:8 Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, drive out demons. You have received without payment, so give without payment.
40Mt 10:9 Don't take any gold, silver, or copper in your moneybags,
40Mt 10:10 or a traveling bag for the trip, or an extra shirt, or sandals, or a walking stick, because a worker deserves his food. 
40Mt 10:11 "Whatever town or village you enter, find out who is receptive in it and stay there until you leave.
40Mt 10:12 As you enter the house, greet its occupants.
40Mt 10:13 If the household is receptive, let your blessing of peace come on it. But if it isn't receptive, let your blessing of peace return to you.
40Mt 10:14 If no one welcomes you or listens to your words, as you leave that house or town, shake its dust off your feet.
40Mt 10:15 I tell you with certainty, it will be more bearable for the region of Sodom and Gomorrah on the day of judgment than for that town!" 
40Mt 10:16 "See, I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. So be as cunning as serpents and as innocent as doves.
40Mt 10:17 Watch out for people who will hand you over to the local councils and whip you in their synagogues.
40Mt 10:18 You will be brought before governors and kings because of me, to testify to them and to the gentiles.
40Mt 10:19 When they hand you over, don't worry about how you are to speak or what you are to say, because in that hour what you are to say will be given to you.
40Mt 10:20 It won't be you speaking, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you.
40Mt 10:21 "Brother will hand brother over for execution, and a father his child. Children will rebel against parents and have them put to death.
40Mt 10:22 You will be hated by everyone because of my name. But the person who endures to the end will be saved.
40Mt 10:23 So when they persecute you in one town, flee to the next, because I tell you with certainty that you will not have gone through the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. 
40Mt 10:24 "A disciple is not above his teacher, and a slave is not above his master.
40Mt 10:25 It is enough for a disciple to be like his teacher and a slave to be like his master. If they have called the head of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they do the same to those of his household!" 
40Mt 10:26 "So never be afraid of them, because there is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and nothing secret that will not be made known.
40Mt 10:27 What I tell you in darkness you must speak in the daylight, and what is whispered in your ear you must shout from the housetops.
40Mt 10:28 Stop being afraid of those who kill the body but can't kill the soul. Instead, be afraid of the one who can destroy both body and soul in hell.
40Mt 10:29 "Two sparrows are sold for a penny, aren't they? Yet not one of them will fall to the ground without your Father's permission.
40Mt 10:30 Indeed, even the hairs on your head have all been counted!
40Mt 10:31 So stop being afraid. You are worth more than a bunch of sparrows."
40Mt 10:32 "Therefore, everyone who acknowledges me before people I, too, will acknowledge before my Father in heaven.
40Mt 10:33 But whoever denies me before people I, too, will deny before my Father in heaven." 
40Mt 10:34 "Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth. I did not come to bring peace but a sword!
40Mt 10:35 I came to turn 'a man against his father, a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.
40Mt 10:36 A person's enemies will include members of his own family.'
40Mt 10:37 "The one who loves his father or mother more than me isn't worthy of me, and the one who loves a son or daughter more than me isn't worthy of me.
40Mt 10:38 The one who doesn't take up his cross and follow me isn't worthy of me.
40Mt 10:39 The one who finds his life will lose it, and the one who loses his life because of me will find it." 
40Mt 10:40 "The one who receives you receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me.
40Mt 10:41 The one who receives a prophet as a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and the one who receives a righteous person as a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward.
40Mt 10:42 I tell you with certainty, whoever gives even a cup of cold water to one of these little ones because he is a disciple will never lose his reward." 
40Mt 11:1 When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he left there to teach and preach in their home towns.
40Mt 11:2 Now when John in prison heard about the activities of the Messiah, he sent a message by his disciples
40Mt 11:3 and asked him, "Are you the Coming One, or should we wait for someone else?" 
40Mt 11:4 Jesus answered them, "Go and tell John what you hear and observe£º
40Mt 11:5 the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear, the dead are raised, and the destitute hear the good news.
40Mt 11:6 How blessed is anyone who is not offended by me!"
40Mt 11:7 As they were leaving, Jesus began to speak to the crowds about John. "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind - 
40Mt 11:8 Really, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fancy clothes? See, those who wear fancy clothes live in kings' houses.
40Mt 11:9 Really, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet!
40Mt 11:10 This is the man about whom it is written, 'See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'
40Mt 11:11 I tell you with certainty, among those born of women no one has appeared who is greater than John the Baptist. Yet even the least important person in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he.
40Mt 11:12 "From the days of John the Baptist until the present, the kingdom of heaven has been forcefully advancing, and violent people have been attacking it,
40Mt 11:13 because the Law and all the Prophets prophesied up to the time of John.
40Mt 11:14 If you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come.
40Mt 11:15 Let the person who has ears listen!
40Mt 11:16 "To what can I compare the people living today? They're like little children who sit in the marketplaces and shout to each other, 
40Mt 11:17 'A wedding song we played for you, the dance you simply scorned. A woeful dirge we chanted, too, but then you would not mourn.'
40Mt 11:18 Because John didn't come eating or drinking, yet people say, 'He has a demon!'
40Mt 11:19 The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look, a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Absolved from every act of sin, is wisdom by her kith and kin."
40Mt 11:20 Then Jesus began to denounce the cities in which most of his miracles had taken place, because they didn't repent.
40Mt 11:21 "How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! Because if the miracles that happened in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes.
40Mt 11:22 Indeed I tell you, it will be more bearable for Tyre and Sidon on the day of judgment than for you!
40Mt 11:23 "And you, Capernaum! You won't be lifted up to heaven, will you? You'll go down to Hell! Because if the miracles that happened in you had taken place in Sodom, it would have remained to this day.
40Mt 11:24 Indeed I tell you, it will be more bearable for the land of Sodom on the day of judgment than for you!" 
40Mt 11:25 At that time Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from wise and intelligent people and have revealed them to infants.
40Mt 11:26 Yes, Father, because this is what was pleasing to you.
40Mt 11:27 All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one fully knows the Son except the Father, and no one fully knows the Father except the Son and the person to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. 
40Mt 11:28 "Come to me, all of you who are weary and loaded down with burdens, and I will give you rest.
40Mt 11:29 Place my yoke on you and learn from me, because I am gentle and humble, and you will find rest for your souls,
40Mt 11:30 because my yoke is pleasant, and my burden is light."
40Mt 12:1 At that time Jesus walked through the grain fields on a Sabbath. His disciples became hungry and began picking heads of grain to eat.
40Mt 12:2 When the Pharisees saw this, they said to him, "Look! Your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath!"
40Mt 12:3 But he said to them, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry - 
40Mt 12:4 How is it that he went into the house of God and ate the Bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for him and his companions to eat but was reserved for the priests - 
40Mt 12:5 Or haven't you read in the law that on every Sabbath the priests in the temple violate the Sabbath and yet are innocent - 
40Mt 12:6 But I tell you, something greater than the temple is here!
40Mt 12:7 If you had known what 'I want mercy and not sacrifice' means, you would not have condemned the innocent,
40Mt 12:8 for the Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."5
40Mt 12:9 Moving on from there, Jesus went into their synagogue.
40Mt 12:10 Suddenly a man with a paralyzed hand appeared. The people asked Jesus if it was lawful to heal on Sabbath days, intending to accuse him of doing something wrong. 
40Mt 12:11 But he asked them, "Is there a man among you who, if he had one sheep and it fell into a ditch on the Sabbath, wouldn't take hold of it and pull it out - 
40Mt 12:12 How much more is a human being worth than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on Sabbath days."
40Mt 12:13 Then he said to the man, "Hold out your hand." He held it out and it became normal, as healthy as his other hand.
40Mt 12:14 The Pharisees, however, went out and plotted against Jesus to kill him.
40Mt 12:15 When Jesus became aware of this, he left that place. Many crowds followed him, and he healed all of them,
40Mt 12:16 ordering them not to make him known.
40Mt 12:17 This was to fulfill what was declared by the prophet Isaiah when he said,
40Mt 12:18 "Here is my Servant whom I have chosen, whom I love, and with whom I am pleased! I will put my Spirit on him, and he will proclaim justice to the gentiles.
40Mt 12:19 He will not quarrel or shout, and no one will hear him shouting in the streets.
40Mt 12:20 He will not snap off a broken reed or snuff out a smoldering wick until he has brought justice through to victory.
40Mt 12:21 And in his name the gentiles will hope."
40Mt 12:22 Then a demon-possessed man who was blind and unable to talk was brought to him. Jesus healed him so that the man could speak and see.
40Mt 12:23 All the crowds were amazed and kept saying, "This man isn't the Son of David, is he?"
40Mt 12:24 But when the Pharisees heard this, they said, "This man drives out demons only by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons." 
40Mt 12:25 He knew what they were thinking and said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is destroyed, and every city or household divided against itself will not stand.
40Mt 12:26 So if Satan drives out Satan, he is divided against himself. How, then, can his kingdom stand - 
40Mt 12:27 If I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own followers drive them out? That is why they will be your judges!
40Mt 12:28 But if I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you.
40Mt 12:29 How can someone go into a strong man's house and carry off his possessions without first tying up the strong man? Then he can ransack his house. 
40Mt 12:30 "The person who isn't with me is against me, and the person who isn't gathering with me is scattering.
40Mt 12:31 So I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven, but blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven.
40Mt 12:32 Whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the one to come." 
40Mt 12:33 "Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree rotten and its fruit rotten, because a tree is known by its fruit.
40Mt 12:34 You children of serpents! How can you say anything good when you are evil? The mouth speaks about what overflows from the heart.
40Mt 12:35 A good person brings good things out of a good treasure house, and an evil person brings evil things out of an evil treasure house.
40Mt 12:36 I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give an account for every thoughtless word they have uttered,
40Mt 12:37 because by your words you will be acquitted, and by your words you will be condemned."36
40Mt 12:38 Then some of the scribes and Pharisees said to Jesus, "Teacher, we want to see a sign from you." 
40Mt 12:39 But he replied to them, "An evil and adulterous generation craves a sign. Yet no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah,
40Mt 12:40 because just as Jonah was in the stomach of the sea creature for three days and three nights, so the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth for three days and three nights.
40Mt 12:41 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment and condemn the people living today, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. But look - something greater than Jonah is here!
40Mt 12:42 The queen of the south will stand up and condemn the people living today, because she came from so far away to hear the wisdom of Solomon. But look! Something greater than Solomon is here!" 
40Mt 12:43 "Whenever an unclean spirit goes out of a person, it wanders through waterless places looking for a place to rest but finds none.
40Mt 12:44 Then it says, 'I will go back to my home that I left.' When it arrives, it finds it empty, swept clean, and put in order.
40Mt 12:45 Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they go in and settle there. And so the final condition of that person becomes worse than the first. That's just what will happen to this evil generation!" 
40Mt 12:46 While Jesus was still speaking to the crowds, his mother and brothers stood outside, wanting to speak to him.
40Mt 12:47 Someone told him, "Look! Your mother and your brothers are standing outside asking to speak to you." 
40Mt 12:48 He asked the man who told him, "Who is my mother, and who are my brothers?"
40Mt 12:49 Then pointing with his hand at his disciples, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers,
40Mt 12:50 because whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother." 
40Mt 13:1 That day Jesus left the house and sat down beside the sea.
40Mt 13:2 Such large crowds gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat down, while the entire crowd stood on the shore.
40Mt 13:3 Then he began to tell them many things in parables. He said, "Listen! A farmer went out to sow.
40Mt 13:4 As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, and birds came and ate them up.
40Mt 13:5 Other seeds fell on stony ground, where they did not have a lot of soil. They sprouted at once because the soil wasn't deep.
40Mt 13:6 But when the sun came up, they were scorched. Since they did not have any roots, they dried up.
40Mt 13:7 Other seeds fell among thorn bushes, and the thorn bushes grew higher and choked them out.
40Mt 13:8 But other seeds fell on good soil and produced a crop, some10 0, some60 , and some30 times what was sown.
40Mt 13:9 Let the person who has ears listen!"
40Mt 13:10 Then the disciples came and asked Jesus, "Why do you speak to people in parables?"
40Mt 13:11 He answered them, "You have been given knowledge about the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but it hasn't been given to them,
40Mt 13:12 because to anyone who has something, more will be given, and he will have more than enough. But from the one who doesn't have anything, even what he has will be taken away from him.
40Mt 13:13 That's why I speak to them in parables, because 'they look but don't see, and they listen but don't hear or understand.'
40Mt 13:14 "With them the prophecy of Isaiah is being fulfilled, which says£º 'You will listen and listen but never understand. You will look and look but never comprehend,
40Mt 13:15 for this people's heart has become dull, and their ears are hard of hearing. They have shut their eyes so that they might not see with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.'
40Mt 13:16 "How blessed are your eyes because they see, and your ears because they hear!
40Mt 13:17 I tell you with certainty, many prophets and righteous people longed to see the things you see but did not see them, and to hear the things you hear but did not hear them." 
40Mt 13:18 "Listen, then, to the parable about the farmer.
40Mt 13:19 When anyone hears the word about the kingdom yet doesn't understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what was sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path.
40Mt 13:20 As for what was sown on the stony ground, this is the person who hears the word and accepts it joyfully at once,
40Mt 13:21 but since he doesn't have any root in himself, he lasts for only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes along because of the word, he immediately falls away.
40Mt 13:22 As for what was sown among the thorn bushes, this is the person who hears the word, but the worries of life and the deceitful pleasures of wealth choke the word so that it can't produce a crop.
40Mt 13:23 But as for what was sown on good soil, this is the person who hears the word, understands it, and produces a crop that yields10 0,60 , or30 times what was sown."
40Mt 13:24 He presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field.
40Mt 13:25 While people were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away.
40Mt 13:26 When the crop came up and bore grain, the weeds appeared, too.
40Mt 13:27 The owner's servants came and asked him, 'Master, you sowed good seed in your field, didn't you? Then where did these weeds come from?'
40Mt 13:28 He told them, 'An enemy did this!' The servants asked him, 'Then do you want us to go and pull them out?'
40Mt 13:29 He said, 'No! If you pull out the weeds, you might pull out the wheat with them.
40Mt 13:30 Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, "Gather the weeds first and tie them in bundles for burning, but bring the wheat into my barn."'" 
40Mt 13:31 He presented another parable to them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is like a mustard seed that a man took and planted in his field.
40Mt 13:32 Although it is the smallest of all seeds, when it is fully grown it is larger than the garden plants and becomes a tree, and the birds in the sky come and nest in its branches."
40Mt 13:33 He told them another parable£º "The kingdom of heaven is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened." 
40Mt 13:34 Jesus told the crowds all these things in parables. He did not tell them anything without using a parable.
40Mt 13:35 This was to fulfill what was declared by the prophet when he said, "I will open my mouth to speak in parables. I will declare what has been hidden since the creation of the world."
40Mt 13:36 Then Jesus left the crowds and went into the house. His disciples came to him and asked, "Explain to us the parable about the weeds in the field."
40Mt 13:37 He answered, "The person who sowed good seed is the Son of Man,
40Mt 13:38 while the field is the world. The good seed are those who belong to the kingdom, while the weeds are those who belong to the evil one.
40Mt 13:39 The enemy who sowed them is the devil, the harvest is the end of the age, and the reapers are the angels.
40Mt 13:40 Just as weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so it will be at end of the age.
40Mt 13:41 The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather from his kingdom everything that causes others to sin and those who practice lawlessness
40Mt 13:42 and they will throw them into a blazing furnace. In that place there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
40Mt 13:43 Then the righteous will shine like the sun in their Father's kingdom. Let the person who has ears listen!"38
40Mt 13:44 "The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field that a man found and hid. In his excitement he went and sold everything he had and bought that field." 
40Mt 13:45 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant searching for fine pearls.
40Mt 13:46 When he found a very valuable pearl, he went and sold everything he had and bought it." 
40Mt 13:47 "Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a large net thrown into the sea that gathered all kinds of fish.
40Mt 13:48 When it was full, the fishermen hauled it ashore. Then they sat down, sorted the good fish into containers, and threw the bad ones away.
40Mt 13:49 That is how it will be at the end of the age. The angels will go out, cull out the evil people from among the righteous ones,
40Mt 13:50 and will throw them into a blazing furnace. In that place there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth."
40Mt 13:51 "Do you understand all these things?"They said to him, "Yes."
40Mt 13:52 Then he told them, "That is why every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like the master of a household who brings both new and old things out of his treasure chest." 
40Mt 13:53 When Jesus had finished these parables, he left that place.
40Mt 13:54 He went to his hometown and began teaching the people in their synagogue in such a way that they were amazed and asked, "Where did this man get this wisdom and these miracles - 
40Mt 13:55 This is the builder's son, isn't it? His mother is named Mary, isn't she? His brothers are James, Joseph, Simon, and Judas, aren't they - 
40Mt 13:56 And his sisters are all with us, aren't they? So where did this man get all these things?"
40Mt 13:57 And they were offended by him. But Jesus told them, "A prophet is without honor only in his hometown and in his own home."
40Mt 13:58 He did not perform many miracles there because of their unbelief.13
40Mt 14:1 At that time Herod the tetrarch, hearing about the fame of Jesus,
40Mt 14:2 said to his servants, "This is John the Baptist! He has been raised from the dead, and that's why these miracles are being done by him."
40Mt 14:3 Herod had arrested John, bound him with chains, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife.
40Mt 14:4 John had been telling him, "It is not lawful for you to have her."
40Mt 14:5 Although Herod wanted to kill him, he was afraid of the crowd, since they regarded John as a prophet. 
40Mt 14:6 But when Herod's birthday celebration was held, the daughter of Herodias danced before the guests. She pleased Herod
40Mt 14:7 so much that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she asked for.
40Mt 14:8 Prompted by her mother, she said, "Give me, right here on a platter, the head of John the Baptist."
40Mt 14:9 Under pressure because of his promises and his assembled guests, the king ordered that it be done.
40Mt 14:10 So he sent word and had John beheaded in prison.
40Mt 14:11 His head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she took it to her mother.
40Mt 14:12 When John's disciples came, they carried off the body and buried it. Then they went and told Jesus.8
40Mt 14:13 When Jesus heard this, he left that place and went by boat to a deserted place by himself. The crowds heard of it and followed him on foot from the neighboring towns.
40Mt 14:14 When he got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion for them and healed their sick.
40Mt 14:15 When evening had come, the disciples went to him and said, "This is a deserted place, and it's already late. Send the crowds away so that they can go into the villages and buy food for themselves."13
40Mt 14:16 But Jesus said to them, "They don't need to go away. You give them something to eat."
40Mt 14:17 They told him, "We don't have anything here except five loaves of bread and two fish."
40Mt 14:18 He said, "Bring them to me."
40Mt 14:19 Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass. Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves in pieces and gave them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
40Mt 14:20 All of them ate and were filled. Then the disciples picked up what was left of the broken pieces, twelve baskets full.
40Mt 14:21 Now those who had eaten were about 5,000 men, besides women and children.19
40Mt 14:22 Jesus immediately had the disciples get into a boat and cross to the other side ahead of him, while he sent the crowds away.
40Mt 14:23 After dismissing the crowds, he went up on a hillside by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone.
40Mt 14:24 By this time the boat was in the middle of the sea and was being battered by the waves, because the wind was against them.
40Mt 14:25 Shortly before dawn Jesus came to them, walking on the sea.
40Mt 14:26 When the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified and cried out, "It's a ghost!" And they screamed in terror. 
40Mt 14:27 "Have courage!" Jesus immediately told them. "It's me. Stop being afraid!"
40Mt 14:28 Peter answered him, "Lord, if it's you, order me to come to you on the water."
40Mt 14:29 Jesus said, "Come on!" So Peter got down out of the boat, started walking on the water, and came to Jesus.
40Mt 14:30 But when he noticed the strong wind, he was frightened. As he began to sink, he shouted, "Lord, save me!"
40Mt 14:31 At once Jesus reached out his hand, caught him, and asked him, "You who have so little faith, why did you doubt?"
40Mt 14:32 As they got into the boat, the wind stopped blowing.
40Mt 14:33 Then the men in the boat began to worship Jesus, saying, "You certainly are the Son of God!" 
40Mt 14:34 They crossed over and came ashore at Gennesaret.
40Mt 14:35 When the men of that place recognized Jesus, they sent word throughout that region and brought him everyone who was sick.
40Mt 14:36 They kept begging him to let them touch just the tassel of his garment, and everyone who touched it was completely healed.1435 
40Mt 15:1 Then some Pharisees and scribes came from Jerusalem to Jesus and asked,
40Mt 15:2 "Why do your disciples disregard the tradition of the elders? They don't wash their hands when they eat."
40Mt 15:3 But he answered them, "Why do you also disregard the commandment of God because of your tradition - 
40Mt 15:4 Because God said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'Whoever curses father or mother must certainly be put to death.'
40Mt 15:5 But you say 'Whoever tells his father or his mother, "Whatever support you might have received from me has been given to God,"
40Mt 15:6 does not have to honor his father.' Because of your tradition, then, you have disregarded the authority of God's word.
40Mt 15:7 You hypocrites! How well did Isaiah prophesy of you when he said, 
40Mt 15:8 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
40Mt 15:9 Their worship of me is empty, because they teach human rules as doctrines.'"
40Mt 15:10 Then calling out to the crowd, he addressed them, "Listen and understand!
40Mt 15:11 It is not what goes into the mouth that makes a person unclean. It is what comes out of the mouth that makes a person unclean." 
40Mt 15:12 Then the disciples came and asked him, "Do you realize that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this statement?"
40Mt 15:13 He replied, "Every plant that my heavenly Father did not plant will be pulled up by the roots.
40Mt 15:14 Leave them alone. They are blind guides of the blind. If one blind person leads another blind person, both will fall into a ditch." 
40Mt 15:15 Then Peter said to him, "Explain to us this parable." 
40Mt 15:16 Jesus said, "Are you still so ignorant - 
40Mt 15:17 Don't you know that everything that goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and then is expelled as waste - 
40Mt 15:18 But the things that come out of the mouth come from the heart, and it is those things that make a person unclean.
40Mt 15:19 It is out of the heart that evil thoughts come, as well as murder, adultery, sexual immorality, stealing, false testimony, and slander.
40Mt 15:20 These are the things that make a person unclean. But eating with unwashed hands doesn't make a person unclean."18
40Mt 15:21 Then Jesus left that place and went to the region of Tyre and Sidon.
40Mt 15:22 Suddenly a Canaanite woman from that territory came near and began to shout, "Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David! My daughter is severely demon-possessed!"
40Mt 15:23 But he didn't answer her at all. Then his disciples came up and kept urging him, "Send her away, because she keeps on screaming as she follows us."
40Mt 15:24 But he replied, "I was sent only to the lost sheep of the nation of Israel." 
40Mt 15:25 Then she came and fell down before him, saying, "Lord, help me!"
40Mt 15:26 He replied, "It's not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the puppies." 
40Mt 15:27 She said, "Yes, Lord. But even the puppies eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' tables."
40Mt 15:28 Then Jesus answered her, "Lady, your faith is great! What you want is granted." That very hour her daughter was healed.
40Mt 15:29 Jesus left there and went along the Sea of Galilee. Then he went up on a hillside and sat down.
40Mt 15:30 Large crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, those unable to talk, and many others. They placed them at his feet, and he healed them.
40Mt 15:31 As a result, the crowd was amazed to see those who were unable to talk speaking, the crippled healed, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. So they praised the God of Israel.
40Mt 15:32 Then Jesus called his disciples and said, "I have compassion for the crowd because they have already been with me for three days and have nothing to eat. I don't want to send them away without food, or they may faint on the road."
40Mt 15:33 The disciples asked him, "Where in the wilderness are we to get enough bread to feed such a crowd?" 
40Mt 15:34 Jesus asked them, "How many loaves of bread do you have?" They said, "Seven, and a few small fish."
40Mt 15:35 Ordering the crowd to sit down on the ground,
40Mt 15:36 he took the seven loaves and the fish and gave thanks. Then he broke them in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds.
40Mt 15:37 All of them ate until they were filled, then the disciples picked up what was left of the broken pieces - seven baskets full.
40Mt 15:38 Now those who had eaten were four thousand men, besides women and children.
40Mt 15:39 After he sent the crowds away, he got into a boat and went to the region of Magadan.
40Mt 16:1 When the Pharisees and Sadducees arrived, in order to test Jesus they asked him to show them a sign from heaven.
40Mt 16:2 He replied to them, "You say, 'Red sky at night, what a delight!
40Mt 16:3 Red sky in the morning, cloudy and storming.'You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, yet you can't interpret the signs of the times - 
40Mt 16:4 An evil and adulterous generation craves a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah." Then he left them and went away. 
40Mt 16:5 When his disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to take any bread along.
40Mt 16:6 Jesus said to them, "Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!" 
40Mt 16:7 As they began to discuss this among themselves, they kept saying, "We didn't bring along any bread."
40Mt 16:8 Knowing this, Jesus asked them, "You who have little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you don't have any bread - 
40Mt 16:9 Don't you understand yet? Don't you remember the five loaves for the 5,000 and how many baskets you collected,
40Mt 16:10 or the seven loaves for the 4,000 and how many baskets you collected - 
40Mt 16:11 How can you fail to understand that I wasn't talking to you about bread? Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and Sadducees!"
40Mt 16:12 Then they understood that he did not say to beware of the yeast used in bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees.
40Mt 16:13 When Jesus had come to the region of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, "Who do people say the Son of Man is?" 
40Mt 16:14 They said, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others Jeremiah or one of the prophets."
40Mt 16:15 He asked them, "But who do you say I am?"
40Mt 16:16 Simon Peter answered, "You are the Messiah, the Son of the living God!" 
40Mt 16:17 Then Jesus said to him, "How blessed you are, Simon son of Jonah, since flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, though my Father in heaven has.
40Mt 16:18 I tell you that you are Peter, and it is on this rock that I will build my congregation, and the powers of hell will not conquer it.
40Mt 16:19 I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Whatever you prohibit on earth will have been prohibited in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will have been permitted in heaven."
40Mt 16:20 Then he strictly ordered the disciples not to tell anyone that he was the Messiah.
40Mt 16:21 From that time on, Jesus began to show his disciples that he would have to go to Jerusalem and suffer a great deal because of the elders, the high priests, and the scribes. Then he would be killed, but on the third day he would be raised.
40Mt 16:22 Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, "God be merciful to you, Lord! This must never happen to you!"
40Mt 16:23 But Jesus turned and said to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan! You are an offense to me, because you are not thinking God's thoughts but human thoughts!" 
40Mt 16:24 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, pick up his cross, and follow me continually.
40Mt 16:25 Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it,
40Mt 16:26 because what profit will a person have if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what can a person give in exchange for his life - 
40Mt 16:27 The Son of Man is going to come with his angels in his Father's glory, and then he will repay everyone according to what he has done.
40Mt 16:28 I tell you with certainty, some people standing here will not experience death before they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom." 
40Mt 17:1 Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and his brother John and led them up a high mountain by themselves.
40Mt 17:2 His appearance was changed in front of them, his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became as white as light.
40Mt 17:3 Suddenly, Moses and Elijah appeared to them, talking with Jesus.
40Mt 17:4 Then Peter said to Jesus, "Lord, it's good that we're here! If you want, I'll set up three shelters - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
40Mt 17:5 He was still speaking when a bright cloud suddenly overshadowed them. A voice from the cloud said, "This is my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with him. Keep on listening to him!" 
40Mt 17:6 When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified. 
40Mt 17:7 But Jesus came up to them and touched them, saying, "Get up, and stop being afraid."
40Mt 17:8 When they raised their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus all by himself.
40Mt 17:9 On their way down the mountain, Jesus ordered them, "Don't tell anyone about this vision until the Son of Man has been raised from the dead." 
40Mt 17:10 So the disciples asked him, "Why, then, do the scribes say that Elijah must come first?"
40Mt 17:11 He answered them, "Elijah is indeed coming and will restore all things.
40Mt 17:12 But I tell you that Elijah has already come, yet people did not recognize him and treated him just as they pleased. In the same way, the Son of Man is going to suffer at their hands."
40Mt 17:13 Then the disciples understood that he had been speaking to them about John the Baptist. 
40Mt 17:14 As they approached the crowd, a man came up to Jesus, knelt down in front of him,
40Mt 17:15 and said, "Sir, have mercy on my son, because he is an epileptic and suffers terribly. Often he falls into fire and often into water.
40Mt 17:16 I brought him to your disciples, but they couldn't heal him."
40Mt 17:17 Jesus replied, "You unbelieving and perverted generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him here to me!"
40Mt 17:18 Then Jesus rebuked the demon and it came out of him, and the boy was healed that very hour.
40Mt 17:19 Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and asked, "Why couldn't we drive it out?"
40Mt 17:20 He told them, "Because of your lack of faith. I tell you with certainty, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you can say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you.
40Mt 17:21 But this kind does not come out except by prayer and fasting."17
40Mt 17:22 While they were gathering together in Galilee, Jesus told them, "The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands.
40Mt 17:23 They will kill him, but he will be raised on the third day." Then they were filled with grief.1722
40Mt 17:24 When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the temple tax came up to Peter and asked, "Your teacher pays the temple tax, doesn't he?" 
40Mt 17:25 He answered, "Yes." When Peter went home, Jesus spoke to him first and asked him, "What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings on the earth collect tolls or tributes? From their own subjects, or from foreigners?"
40Mt 17:26 "From foreigners," he replied. So Jesus said to him, "In that case, the subjects are exempt.
40Mt 17:27 However, so that we don't offend them, go to the sea and throw in a hook. Take the first fish that comes up, open its mouth, and you will find a coin. Take it and give it to them for me and you."
40Mt 18:1 At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, "Who, then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?"
40Mt 18:2 Calling a little child forward, he had him stand among them.
40Mt 18:3 Then he said, "I tell you with certainty, unless you change and become like little children, you will never get into the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 18:4 Therefore, whoever humbles himself as this little child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven,
40Mt 18:5 and whoever receives a little child like this in my name receives me." 
40Mt 18:6 "If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were drowned at the bottom of the sea.
40Mt 18:7 How terrible it will be for the world due to its temptations to sin! Temptations to sin are bound to happen, but how terrible it will be for that person who causes someone to sin! 
40Mt 18:8 "So if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life injured or crippled than to have two hands or two feet and be thrown into eternal fire.
40Mt 18:9 And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell fire.
40Mt 18:10 "See to it that you do not despise one of these little ones, because I tell you, their angels in heaven always have access to my Father in heaven.
40Mt 18:11 For the Son of Man came to save the lost."
40Mt 18:12 "What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them strays, he leaves the ninety-nine in the hills and goes to look for the one that has strayed, doesn't he - 
40Mt 18:13 If he finds it, I tell you with certainty that he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that haven't strayed.
40Mt 18:14 In the same way, it is not the will of your Father in heaven that one of these little ones should be lost."13
40Mt 18:15 "If your brother sins against you, go and confront him while the two of you are alone. If he listens to you, you have won back your brother.
40Mt 18:16 But if he doesn't listen, take one or two others with you so that 'every word may be confirmed by the testimony of two or three witnesses.'
40Mt 18:17 If, however, he ignores them, tell it to the congregation. If he also ignores the congregation, regard him as a gentile and a tax collector. 
40Mt 18:18 "I tell you with certainty, whatever you prohibit on earth will have been prohibited in heaven, and whatever you permit on earth will have been permitted in heaven.
40Mt 18:19 Furthermore, I tell you with certainty that if two of you agree on earth about anything you request, it will be done for you by my Father in heaven,
40Mt 18:20 because where two or three have come together in my name, I am there among them."
40Mt 18:21 Then Peter came up and asked him, "Lord, how many times may my brother sin against me and I have to forgive him? Seven times?" 
40Mt 18:22 Jesus said to him, "I tell you, not just seven times, but77 times!
40Mt 18:23 "That is why the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wanted to settle accounts with his servants.
40Mt 18:24 When he had begun to settle the accounts, a person who owed him 10,000 talents was brought to him.
40Mt 18:25 Because he couldn't pay, his master ordered him, his wife, his children, and everything that he owned to be sold so that payment could be made.
40Mt 18:26 Then the servant fell down and bowed low before him, saying, 'Be patient with me, and I will repay you everything!'
40Mt 18:27 The master of that servant had compassion and released him, canceling his debt.
40Mt 18:28 "But when that servant went away, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii. He grabbed him, seized him by the throat, and said, 'Pay what you owe!'
40Mt 18:29 Then his fellow servant fell down and began begging him, 'Be patient with me and I will repay you!'
40Mt 18:30 But he refused and went and had him thrown into prison until he could repay the debt.
40Mt 18:31 "When his fellow servants saw what had happened, they were very disturbed and went and reported to their master everything that had occurred.
40Mt 18:32 Then his master sent for him and said to him, 'You evil servant! I canceled that entire debt for you because you begged me.
40Mt 18:33 Shouldn't you have had mercy on your fellow servant, just as I had mercy on you?'
40Mt 18:34 In anger his master handed him over to the torturers until he could repay the entire debt.
40Mt 18:35 This is how my heavenly Father will treat each one of you unless you forgive your brother from your hearts."1834
40Mt 19:1 When Jesus had finished saying these things, he left Galilee and went to the territory of Judea on the other side of the Jordan.
40Mt 19:2 Large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. 
40Mt 19:3 Some Pharisees came to him in order to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any reason?"
40Mt 19:4 He answered them, "Haven't you read that the one who made them at the beginning 'made them male and female'
40Mt 19:5 and said, 'That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife, and the two will become one flesh' - 
40Mt 19:6 So they are no longer two, but one flesh. Therefore, what God has joined together, man must never separate."
40Mt 19:7 They asked him, "Why, then, did Moses order us 'to give a certificate of divorce and divorce her'?"
40Mt 19:8 He said to them, "It was because of your hardness of heart that Moses allowed you to divorce your wives. But from the beginning it was not this way.
40Mt 19:9 I tell you that whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another woman commits adultery."819
40Mt 19:10 His disciples asked him, "If that is the relationship of a man with his wife, it's not worth getting married!" 
40Mt 19:11 "Not everyone can accept this saying," he replied, "except those to whom celibacy has been granted,
40Mt 19:12 because some men are celibate from birth, while some are celibate because they have been made that way by others. Still others are celibate because they have made themselves that way for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let anyone accept this who can." 
40Mt 19:13 Then some little children were brought to him so that he might lay his hands on them and pray. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
40Mt 19:14 Jesus, however, said, "Let the little children come to me, and stop keeping them away, because the kingdom of heaven belongs to people like these."
40Mt 19:15 When he had laid his hands on them, he went on from there.
40Mt 19:16 Just then a man came up to Jesus. "Teacher," he asked, "what good deed should I do to have eternal life?" 
40Mt 19:17 Jesus asked him, "Why ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you want to get into that life, you must keep the commandments."
40Mt 19:18 The young man asked him, "Which ones?" Jesus said, "'You must not murder, you must not commit adultery, you must not steal, you must not give false testimony,
40Mt 19:19 honor your father and mother,' and 'you must love your neighbor as yourself.'"
40Mt 19:20 The young man said to him, "I have kept all of these. What do I still lack?"
40Mt 19:21 Jesus said to him, "If you want to be perfect, go and sell what you own and give the money to the destitute, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me."
40Mt 19:22 But when the young man heard this statement he went away sad, because he had many possessions.
40Mt 19:23 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "I tell you with certainty, it will be hard for a rich person to get into the kingdom of heaven.
40Mt 19:24 Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God."19
40Mt 19:25 When the disciples heard this, they were completely astonished. "Who, then, can be saved?" they asked.19
40Mt 19:26 Jesus looked at them intently and said, "For humans this is impossible, but for God all things are possible." 
40Mt 19:27 "Look!" Peter replied. "We have left everything and followed you. So what will we get?" 
40Mt 19:28 Jesus said to them, "I tell you with certainty, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne in the renewed creation, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, governing the twelve tribes of Israel.
40Mt 19:29 In fact, everyone who has left his homes, brothers, sisters, father, mother, children, or fields because of my name will receive a hundred times as much and will inherit eternal life.
40Mt 19:30 But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first."
40Mt 20:1 "The kingdom of heaven is like a landowner who went out early in the morning to hire workers for his vineyard.
40Mt 20:2 After agreeing to pay the workers one denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard.
40Mt 20:3 When he went out about nine o'clock, he saw others standing in the marketplace without work.
40Mt 20:4 He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard, too, and I will pay you whatever is right.'
40Mt 20:5 So off they went. He went out again about noon and about three o'clock and did the same thing.
40Mt 20:6 About five o'clock he went out and found some others standing around. He asked them, 'Why are you standing here all day long without work?'
40Mt 20:7 They told him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard as well.'2
40Mt 20:8 "When evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his manager, 'Call the workers and give them their wages, beginning with the last and ending with the first.'
40Mt 20:9 Those who were hired at five o'clock came, and each received a denarius.
40Mt 20:10 "When the first came, they thought they would receive more, but each received a denarius as well.
40Mt 20:11 When they received it, they began to complain to the landowner,
40Mt 20:12 'These last fellows worked only one hour, but you paid them the same as us, and we've been working all day, enduring the scorching heat!'
40Mt 20:13 "But he said to one of them, 'Friend, I'm not treating you unfairly. You did agree with me for a denarius, didn't you - 
40Mt 20:14 Take what is yours and go. I want to give this last man as much as I gave you.
40Mt 20:15 I am allowed to do what I want with my own money, am I not? Or are you envious because I'm generous?'
40Mt 20:16 "In the same way, the last will be first, and the first will be last, because many are called, but few are chosen."
40Mt 20:17 When Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside and said to them as they were walking along,
40Mt 20:18 "See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be handed over to the high priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death.
40Mt 20:19 Then they will hand him over to the gentiles to be mocked, whipped, and crucified, but on the third day he will be raised." 
40Mt 20:20 Then Zebedee's wife came to Jesus with her sons. She bowed down in front of him to ask him for a favor.
40Mt 20:21 He asked her, "What do you want?"She said to him, "Promise that in your kingdom these two sons of mine will sit on your right and on your left."
40Mt 20:22 Jesus replied, "You don't realize what you're asking. Can you drink from the cup that I'm going to drink from?" They told him, "We can." 
40Mt 20:23 He said to them, "You will indeed drink from my cup. But it's not up to me to grant you a seat at my right hand or at my left. These positions have already been prepared for others by my Father." 
40Mt 20:24 When the ten heard this, they became furious with the two brothers.
40Mt 20:25 But Jesus called the disciples and said, "You know that the rulers of the gentiles lord it over them and their superiors act like tyrants over them.
40Mt 20:26 That's not the way it should be among you. Instead, whoever wants to be great among you must be your servant,
40Mt 20:27 and whoever wants to be first among you must be your slave.
40Mt 20:28 That's the way it is with the Son of Man. He did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many people." 
40Mt 20:29 As they were leaving Jericho, a large crowd followed Jesus.
40Mt 20:30 When two blind men who were sitting by the roadside heard that Jesus was passing by, they shouted, "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!"
40Mt 20:31 When the crowd told them harshly to be silent, they shouted even louder, "Have mercy on us, Lord, Son of David!"
40Mt 20:32 Jesus stopped and called them, saying, "What do you want me to do for you?"20
40Mt 20:33 They told him, "Lord, we want to be able to see!"
40Mt 20:34 Then Jesus, deeply moved with compassion, touched their eyes, and at once they could see again. So they followed him.
40Mt 21:1 When they came near Jerusalem and had reached Bethphage on the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two disciples on ahead and
40Mt 21:2 said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you. At once you will find a donkey tied up and a colt with it. Untie them, and bring them to me.
40Mt 21:3 If anyone says anything to you, tell him, 'The Lord needs them,' and that person will send them at once."
40Mt 21:4 Now this happened to fulfill what had been spoken through the prophet when he said,
40Mt 21:5 "Tell the daughter of Zion, 'Look, your king is coming to you! He is humble and mounted on a donkey, even on a colt of a donkey.'"
40Mt 21:6 So the disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them.
40Mt 21:7 They brought the donkey and the colt and put their coats on them, and he sat upon them.
40Mt 21:8 Many people in the crowd spread their own coats on the road, while others began cutting down branches from the trees and spreading them on the road.
40Mt 21:9 Both the crowds that went ahead of him and those that followed him kept shouting, "Hosanna to the Son of David! How blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
40Mt 21:10 When he came into Jerusalem, the whole city was trembling with excitement. The people were asking, "Who is this?" 
40Mt 21:11 The crowds kept saying, "This is the prophet Jesus, the man from Nazareth in Galilee." 
40Mt 21:12 Then Jesus went into the temple, threw out everyone who was selling and buying in the temple, and overturned the moneychangers' tables and the chairs of those who sold doves.
40Mt 21:13 He told them, "It is written, 'My house is to be called a house of prayer,' but you are turning it into a hideout for bandits!" 
40Mt 21:14 Blind and lame people came to him in the temple, and he healed them.
40Mt 21:15 But when the high priests and the scribes saw the amazing things that he had done and the children shouting in the temple, "Hosanna to the Son of David," they became furious
40Mt 21:16 and asked him, "Do you hear what these people are saying?" Jesus said to them, "Yes! Haven't you ever read, 'From the mouths of infants and nursing babies you have created praise'?"
40Mt 21:17 Then he left them and went out of the city to Bethany and spent the night there. 
40Mt 21:18 In the morning, as Jesus was returning to the city, he became hungry.
40Mt 21:19 Seeing a fig tree by the roadside, he went up to it but found nothing on it except leaves. He said to it, "May fruit never come from you again!" And immediately the fig tree dried up. 
40Mt 21:20 When the disciples saw this, they were amazed. "How did the fig tree dry up so quickly?" they asked. 
40Mt 21:21 Jesus answered them, "I tell you with certainty, if you have faith and do not doubt, not only will you be able to do what has been done to the fig tree, but you will also say to this mountain, 'Be removed and thrown into the sea,' and it will happen.
40Mt 21:22 You will receive whatever you ask for in prayer, if you believe." 
40Mt 21:23 Then Jesus went into the temple. While he was teaching, the high priests and the elders of the people came to him and asked, "By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?" 
40Mt 21:24 Jesus answered them, "I, too, will ask you one question. If you answer it for me, I will also tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
40Mt 21:25 Where did John's authority to baptize come from? From heaven or from humans?" They began discussing this among themselves, saying, "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
40Mt 21:26 But if we say, 'From humans,' we are afraid of the crowd, because everyone regards John as a prophet."
40Mt 21:27 So they said to Jesus, "We don't know." He in turn told them, "Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things."
40Mt 21:28 "But what do you think? A man had two sons. He went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.'
40Mt 21:29 His son replied, 'I don't want to,' but later he changed his mind and went.
40Mt 21:30 Then the father went to the other son and told him the same thing. He replied, 'I will, sir,' but he didn't go.
40Mt 21:31 Which of the two did the father's will?"They answered, "The first one." Jesus said to them, "I tell you with certainty, tax collectors and prostitutes will get into God's kingdom ahead of you!
40Mt 21:32 John came to you living a righteous life, and you didn't believe him, but the tax collectors and prostitutes did. But even when you saw that, you didn't change your minds at last and believe him."
40Mt 21:33 "Listen to another parable. There was a landowner who planted a vineyard, put a wall around it, dug a wine press in it, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went abroad.
40Mt 21:34 When harvest time approached, he sent his servants to the tenant farmers to collect his produce.
40Mt 21:35 But the farmers took his servants and beat one, killed another, and attacked another with stones.
40Mt 21:36 Again, he sent other servants to them, a greater number than the first, but the tenant farmers treated them the same way.
40Mt 21:37 Finally, he sent his son to them, thinking, 'They will respect my son.'
40Mt 21:38 But when the tenant farmers saw his son, they said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come on, let's kill him and get his inheritance!'
40Mt 21:39 So they grabbed him, threw him out of the vineyard, and killed him.
40Mt 21:40 Now when the owner of the vineyard returns, what will he do to those farmers?"3321
40Mt 21:41 They said to him, "He will put those horrible men to a horrible death. Then he will lease the vineyard to other farmers who will give him his produce at harvest time." 
40Mt 21:42 Jesus asked them, "Have you never read in the Scriptures, 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone. This was the Lord's doing, and it is amazing in our eyes.' - 
40Mt 21:43 That is why I tell you that the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people who will produce fruit for it.
40Mt 21:44 The person who falls over this stone will be broken to pieces, but it will crush anyone on whom it falls."
40Mt 21:45 When the high priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they knew that he was talking about them.
40Mt 21:46 Although they wanted to arrest him, they were afraid of the crowds, who considered Jesus to be a prophet. 
40Mt 22:1 Again Jesus spoke to them in parables. He said,
40Mt 22:2 "The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding banquet for his son.
40Mt 22:3 He sent his servants to call those who had been invited to the wedding, but they refused to come.
40Mt 22:4 So he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who have been invited, "Look, I've prepared my dinner. My oxen and fattened calves have been slaughtered. Everything is ready. Come to the wedding!"'
40Mt 22:5 But they paid no attention to this and went away, one to his farm, another to his business.
40Mt 22:6 The rest grabbed the king's servants, treated them brutally, and then killed them.
40Mt 22:7 Then the king became outraged. He sent his troops, and they destroyed those murderers and burned their city. 
40Mt 22:8 "Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.
40Mt 22:9 So go into the roads leading out of town and invite as many people as you can find to the wedding.'
40Mt 22:10 Those servants went out into the streets and brought in everyone they found, evil and good alike, and the wedding hall was packed with guests. 
40Mt 22:11 "When the king came in to see the guests, he noticed a man there who was not wearing wedding clothes.
40Mt 22:12 He asked him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without wedding clothes?' But the man was speechless.
40Mt 22:13 Then the king told his servants, 'Tie his hands and feet, and throw him into the darkness outside!' In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth,
40Mt 22:14 because many are invited, but few are chosen." 
40Mt 22:15 Then the Pharisees went and planned how to trap Jesus in conversation.
40Mt 22:16 They sent their disciples to him along with the Herodians. They said, "Teacher, we know that you are sincere and that you teach the way of God truthfully. You don't favor any individual, because you pay no attention to external appearance.
40Mt 22:17 So tell us what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
40Mt 22:18 Recognizing their wickedness, Jesus asked, "Why are you testing me, you hypocrites - 
40Mt 22:19 Show me the coin used for the tax."They brought him a denarius.
40Mt 22:20 Then he asked them, "Whose face and name is this?"
40Mt 22:21 They said to him, "Caesar's." So he said to them, "Then give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." 
40Mt 22:22 When they heard this, they were amazed. Then they left him and went away.
40Mt 22:23 That same day some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him,
40Mt 22:24 "Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and have children for his brother.'
40Mt 22:25 Now there were seven brothers among us. The first one married and died, and since he had no children, he left his widow to his brother.
40Mt 22:26 The same thing happened with the second brother, and then the third, and finally with the rest of the brothers.
40Mt 22:27 Finally, the woman died, too.
40Mt 22:28 Now in the resurrection, whose wife of the seven will she be, since all of them had married her?"26
40Mt 22:29 Jesus answered them, "You are mistaken because you don't know the Scriptures or God's power,
40Mt 22:30 because in the resurrection, people neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angels in heaven.
40Mt 22:31 As for the resurrection from the dead, haven't you read what was spoken to you by God when he said,
40Mt 22:32 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not the God of the dead, but of the living."30
40Mt 22:33 When the crowds heard this, they were amazed at his teaching. 
40Mt 22:34 When the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they met together in the same place.
40Mt 22:35 One of them, an expert in the law, tested him by asking,
40Mt 22:36 "Teacher, which is the greatest commandment in the law?"22
40Mt 22:37 Jesus said to him, "'You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your mind.'
40Mt 22:38 This is the greatest and most important commandment.
40Mt 22:39 The second is exactly like it£º 'You must love your neighbor as yourself.'
40Mt 22:40 All the Law and the Prophets depend on these two commandments." 
40Mt 22:41 While the Pharisees were still gathered, Jesus asked them,
40Mt 22:42 "What do you think about the Messiah? Whose son is he?" They told him, "David's."
40Mt 22:43 He asked them, "Then how can David by the Spirit call him 'Lord' when he says,
40Mt 22:44 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet."' - 
40Mt 22:45 If David calls him 'Lord', how can he be his son?"
40Mt 22:46 No one could answer him at all, and from that day on no one dared to ask him another question. 
40Mt 23:1 Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples,
40Mt 23:2 "The scribes and the Pharisees administer the authority of Moses,
40Mt 23:3 So do whatever they tell you and follow it, but stop doing what they do, because they don't do what they say.
40Mt 23:4 They tie up burdens that are heavy and unbearable and lay them on people's shoulders, but they refuse to lift a finger to remove them. 
40Mt 23:5 "They do everything to be seen by people. They increase the size of their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.
40Mt 23:6 They love to have the places of honor at feasts, the best seats in the synagogues,
40Mt 23:7 to be greeted in the marketplaces, and to be called 'Rabbi' by people.
40Mt 23:8 "But you are not to be called 'Rabbi,' because you have only one teacher, and all of you are brothers.
40Mt 23:9 And don't call anyone on earth 'Father,' because you have only one Father, the one in heaven.
40Mt 23:10 Nor are you to be called 'Teachers,' because you have only one teacher, the Messiah!
40Mt 23:11 The person who is greatest among you must be your servant.
40Mt 23:12 Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. 
40Mt 23:13 "How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You shut the door to the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. You don't go in yourselves, and you don't allow those who are trying to enter to go in.
40Mt 23:14 "How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You devour widows' houses and say long prayers to cover it up. Therefore, you will receive greater condemnation!
40Mt 23:15 "How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You travel over land and sea to make a single convert, and when this happens you make him twice as fit for hell as you are.
40Mt 23:16 "How terrible it will be for you, blind guides! You say, 'Whoever swears an oath by the sanctuary is excused, but whoever swears an oath by the gold of the sanctuary must keep his oath.'
40Mt 23:17 You blind fools! What is more important, the gold or the sanctuary that made the gold holy - 
40Mt 23:18 Again you say, 'Whoever swears an oath by the altar is excused, but whoever swears by the gift that is on it must keep his oath.'
40Mt 23:19 You blind men! Which is more important, the gift or the altar that makes the gift holy - 
40Mt 23:20 Therefore, the one who swears an oath by the altar swears by it and by everything on it.
40Mt 23:21 The one who swears an oath by the sanctuary swears by it and by the one who lives there.
40Mt 23:22 And the one who swears an oath by heaven swears by God's throne and by the one who sits on it.17
40Mt 23:23 "How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You give a tenth of your mint, dill, and cummin, but have neglected the more important matters of the law£º justice, mercy, and faithfulness. These are the things you should have practiced, without neglecting the others.
40Mt 23:24 You blind guides! You filter out a gnat, yet swallow a camel!
40Mt 23:25 "How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but on the inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence.
40Mt 23:26 You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup, so that its outside may also be clean.25
40Mt 23:27 "How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You are like whitewashed tombs that look beautiful on the outside but inside are full of dead people's bones and every kind of impurity.
40Mt 23:28 In the same way, on the outside you look righteous to people, but inside you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.
40Mt 23:29 "How terrible it will be for you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites! You build tombs for the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous.
40Mt 23:30 Then you say, 'If we had been living in the days of our ancestors, we would have had no part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'
40Mt 23:31 Therefore, you testify against yourselves that you are descendants of those who murdered the prophets.
40Mt 23:32 Then finish what your ancestors started!
40Mt 23:33 You snakes, you children of serpents! How can you escape being condemned to hell - 
40Mt 23:34 "That is why I am sending you prophets, wise men, and scribes. Some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will whip in your synagogues and persecute from town to town.
40Mt 23:35 As a result, you will be held accountable for all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of the righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar.
40Mt 23:36 I tell you with certainty, all these things will happen to those living today."
40Mt 23:37 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones to death those who have been sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you were unwilling!
40Mt 23:38 Look! Your house is left abandoned!
40Mt 23:39 I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'How blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!'"23
40Mt 24:1 As Jesus left the temple and was walking away, his disciples came up to him to point out to him the temple buildings.
40Mt 24:2 But he said to them, "You see all these things, don't you? I tell you with certainty, there isn't a single stone here that will be left standing on top of another. They will all be torn down." 
40Mt 24:3 While Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately and said, "Tell us, when will these things take place, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the end of the age?" 
40Mt 24:4 Jesus answered them, "See to it that no one deceives you,
40Mt 24:5 because many will come in my name and say, 'I am the Messiah,' and they will deceive many people.
40Mt 24:6 You are going to hear of wars and rumors of wars. See to it that you are not alarmed. These things must take place, but the end hasn't come yet,
40Mt 24:7 because nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines and earthquakes in various places.
40Mt 24:8 But all these things are only the beginning of the birth pains."
40Mt 24:9 "Then they will hand you over to suffer and will kill you, and you will be hated by all the nations because of my name.
40Mt 24:10 Then many people will fall away, will betray one another, and will hate one another.
40Mt 24:11 Many false prophets will appear and deceive many people,
40Mt 24:12 and because lawlessness will increase, the love of many people will grow cold.
40Mt 24:13 But the person who endures to the end will be saved.
40Mt 24:14 And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come." 
40Mt 24:15 "So when you see the destructive desecration, mentioned by the prophet Daniel, standing in the Holy Place (let the reader take note),
40Mt 24:16 then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.
40Mt 24:17 Anyone who's on the housetop must not come down to get what is in his house,
40Mt 24:18 and anyone who's in the field must not turn back to get his coat.
40Mt 24:19 "How terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days!
40Mt 24:20 Pray that it may not be in winter or on a Sabbath when you flee,
40Mt 24:21 because at that time there will be great suffering, the kind that has not happened from the beginning of the world until now and certainly will never happen again.
40Mt 24:22 If those days had not been limited, no one would survive. But for the sake of the elect, those days will be limited.
40Mt 24:23 "At that time, if anyone says to you, 'Look! Here is the Messiah!' or 'There he is!', don't believe it,
40Mt 24:24 because false messiahs and false prophets will appear and display great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect.
40Mt 24:25 Remember, I have told you this beforehand.
40Mt 24:26 So if they say to you, 'Look! He's in the wilderness,' don't go out looking for him. And if they say, 'Look! He's in the storeroom,' don't believe it,
40Mt 24:27 because just as the lightning comes from the east and flashes as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
40Mt 24:28 Wherever there's a corpse, there the vultures will gather.23
40Mt 24:29 "Immediately after the troubles of those days, 'The sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light, the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of heaven will be shaken loose.'
40Mt 24:30 Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in the sky, and all 'the tribes of the land will mourn' when they see 'the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven' with power and great glory.
40Mt 24:31 He will send out his angels with a loud trumpet blast, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to another."
40Mt 24:32 "Now learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and it produces leaves, you know that summer is near.
40Mt 24:33 In the same way, when you see all these things, you will know that the Son of Man is near, right at the door.
40Mt 24:34 I tell you with certainty, this generation will not disappear until these things happen.
40Mt 24:35 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear."33
40Mt 24:36 "No one knows when that day or hour will come - not the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father,
40Mt 24:37 because just as it was in the days of Noah, so it will be when the Son of Man comes.
40Mt 24:38 In those days before the flood, people were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage right up to the day when Noah went into the ark.
40Mt 24:39 They were unaware of what was happening until the flood came and swept all of them away. That's how it will be when the Son of Man comes.
40Mt 24:40 At that time two people will be in the field. One will be taken, and the other will be left behind.
40Mt 24:41 Two women will be grinding grain at the mill. One will be taken, and the other will be left behind.38
40Mt 24:42 "So keep on watching, because you don't know on what day your Lord is coming.
40Mt 24:43 But be sure of this£º if the owner of the house had known when during the night the thief would be coming, he would have stayed awake and not allowed his house to be broken into.
40Mt 24:44 So you, too, must be ready, because at an hour you are not expecting him the Son of Man will come." 
40Mt 24:45 "Who, then, is the faithful and wise servant whom his master has put in charge of his household to give the others their food at the right time - 
40Mt 24:46 How blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing this when he comes!
40Mt 24:47 I tell you with certainty, he will put him in charge of all his property. 
40Mt 24:48 "But if that wicked servant says to himself, 'My master has been delayed,'
40Mt 24:49 and begins to beat his fellow servants and eat and drink with the drunks,
40Mt 24:50 the master of that servant will come on a day when he doesn't expect him and at an hour that he doesn't know.
40Mt 24:51 Then his master will punish him severely and assign him a place with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
40Mt 25:1 "At that time, the kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten bridesmaids who took their oil lamps and went out to meet the groom.
40Mt 25:2 Now five of them were foolish, and five were wise,
40Mt 25:3 because when the foolish ones took their lamps, they didn't take any oil with them.
40Mt 25:4 But the wise ones took flasks of oil with their lamps.
40Mt 25:5 Since the groom was late, all of them became sleepy and lay down.1
40Mt 25:6 "But at midnight there came a shout£º 'The groom is here! Come out to meet him!'
40Mt 25:7 Then all the bridesmaids woke up and got their lamps ready.
40Mt 25:8 But the foolish ones said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, because our lamps are going out!'
40Mt 25:9 But the wise ones replied, 'No! There will never be enough for us and for you. You'd better go to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.'
40Mt 25:10 "While they were away buying it, the groom arrived. Those who were ready went with him into the wedding banquet, and the door was closed.
40Mt 25:11 Later the other bridesmaids arrived and said, 'Lord, lord, open up for us!'
40Mt 25:12 But he replied, 'I tell you with certainty, I don't know you!'
40Mt 25:13 So keep on watching, because you don't know the day or the hour."
40Mt 25:14 "Similarly, it is like a man going on a trip who called his servants and turned his money over to them.
40Mt 25:15 To one man he gave five talents, to another two, and to another one, based on their ability. Then he went on his trip. 
40Mt 25:16 "The one who received five talents went out at once and invested them and earned five more.
40Mt 25:17 In the same way, the one who had two talents earned two more.
40Mt 25:18 But the one who received one talent went off, dug a hole in the ground, and buried his master's money.
40Mt 25:19 "After a long time the master of those servants returned and settled accounts with them.
40Mt 25:20 The one who had received five talents came up and brought five more talents, saying, 'Master, you gave me five talents. See, I've earned five more talents.'
40Mt 25:21 His master said to him, 'Well done, good and trustworthy servant! Since you have been trustworthy with a small amount, I will put you in charge of a large amount. Come and share your master's joy!' 
40Mt 25:22 "The one with two talents also came forward and said, 'Master, you gave me two talents. See, I've earned two more talents.'
40Mt 25:23 His master said to him, 'Well done, good and trustworthy servant! Since you have been trustworthy with a small amount, I will put you in charge of a large amount. Come and share your master's joy!' 
40Mt 25:24 "Then the one who had received one talent came forward and said, 'Master, I knew that you were a hard man, harvesting where you haven't planted and gathering where you haven't scattered any seed.
40Mt 25:25 Being afraid, I went off and hid your talent in the ground. Here, take what is yours!'
40Mt 25:26 "His master answered him, 'You evil and lazy servant! So you knew that I harvested where I haven't planted and gathered where I haven't scattered any seed - 
40Mt 25:27 Then you should have invested my money with the bankers. When I returned, I would have received my money back with interest.'
40Mt 25:28 Then the master said, 'Take the talent from him and give it to the man who has the ten talents,
40Mt 25:29 because to everyone who has something, more will be given, and he will have more than enough. But from the person who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away from him.
40Mt 25:30 Throw this useless servant into the darkness outside! In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'"
40Mt 25:31 "When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels are with him, he will sit on his glorious throne.
40Mt 25:32 All the nations will be assembled in front of him, and he will cull them out, one from another, like a shepherd separates sheep from goats.
40Mt 25:33 He will put the sheep on his right but the goats on his left.
40Mt 25:34 "Then the king will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who have been blessed by my Father! Inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world,
40Mt 25:35 because I was hungry, and you gave me something to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me something to drink. I was a stranger, and you welcomed me.
40Mt 25:36 I was naked, and you clothed me. I was sick, and you took care of me. I was in prison, and you visited me.' 
40Mt 25:37 "Then the righteous will say to him, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and give you something to eat, or thirsty and give you something to drink - 
40Mt 25:38 When did we see you as a stranger and welcome you, or see you naked and clothe you - 
40Mt 25:39 When did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?'
40Mt 25:40 The king will answer them, 'I tell you with certainty, since you did it for one of the least important of these brothers of mine, you did it for me.' 
40Mt 25:41 "Then he will say to those on his left, 'Get away from me, you who are accursed, into the eternal fire that has been prepared for the devil and his angels!
40Mt 25:42 Here's why£º I was hungry, and you gave me nothing to eat. I was thirsty, and you gave me nothing to drink.
40Mt 25:43 I was a stranger, and you didn't welcome me. I was naked, and you didn't clothe me. I was sick and in prison, and you didn't visit me.'25
40Mt 25:44 "Then they will reply, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or as a stranger or naked or sick or in prison and didn't help you?'
40Mt 25:45 Then he will say to them, 'I tell you with certainty, since you didn't do it for one of the least important of these, you didn't do it for me.'
40Mt 25:46 These people will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous will go into eternal life." 
40Mt 26:1 When Jesus had finished saying all these things, he told his disciples,
40Mt 26:2 "You know that the Passover will take place in two days, and the Son of Man will be handed over to be crucified." 
40Mt 26:3 Then the high priests and the elders of the people assembled in the courtyard of the high priest, who was named Caiaphas.
40Mt 26:4 They conspired to arrest Jesus by treachery and to kill him.
40Mt 26:5 But they kept saying, "This must not happen during the festival. Otherwise, there'll be a riot among the people."4
40Mt 26:6 While Jesus was in Bethany at the home of Simon the leper,
40Mt 26:7 a woman came to him with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume and poured it on his head while he sat at the table.
40Mt 26:8 But when the disciples saw this they became irritated and said, "Why this waste - 
40Mt 26:9 Surely this perfume could have been sold for a high price and the money given to the destitute."7
40Mt 26:10 But knowing this, Jesus asked them, "Why are you bothering the woman? She has done a beautiful thing for me.
40Mt 26:11 You will always have the destitute with you, but you will not always have me.
40Mt 26:12 When she poured this perfume on my body, she was preparing me for burial.
40Mt 26:13 I tell you with certainty, wherever this gospel is proclaimed throughout the whole world, what she has done will also be told as a memorial to her."12
40Mt 26:14 Then one of the twelve disciples, who was called Judas Iscariot, went to the high priests
40Mt 26:15 and inquired, "What are you willing to give me if I betray Jesus to you?" They offered him30 pieces of silver,
40Mt 26:16 and from then on he began to look for an opportunity to betray Jesus.
40Mt 26:17 On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, the disciples approached Jesus and asked, "Where do you want us to make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?" 
40Mt 26:18 He said, "Go to a certain man in the city and say to him, 'The Teacher says, "My time is near. I will celebrate the Passover with my disciples at your house."'"
40Mt 26:19 So the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
40Mt 26:20 When evening came, Jesus was sitting at the table with the twelve disciples.
40Mt 26:21 While they were eating, he said, "I tell you with certainty, one of you is going to betray me."
40Mt 26:22 Feeling deeply distressed, each one began to ask him, "Surely I am not the one, Lord?"
40Mt 26:23 He replied, "The man who has dipped his hand into the bowl with me will betray me.
40Mt 26:24 The Son of Man is going away, just as it has been written about him. How terrible it will be for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had never been born." 
40Mt 26:25 Then Judas, who was going to betray him, asked, "Rabbi, I'm not the one, am I?"Jesus said to him, "You have said so."
40Mt 26:26 While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and handed it to the disciples, saying, "Take this and eat it. This is my body." 
40Mt 26:27 Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, saying, "Drink from it, all of you,
40Mt 26:28 because this is my blood of the new covenant that is being poured out for many people for the forgiveness of sins.
40Mt 26:29 I tell you, I will never again drink the product of the vine until that day when I drink it with you once again in my Father's kingdom." 
40Mt 26:30 After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 
40Mt 26:31 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will turn against me this very night, because it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.'
40Mt 26:32 However, after I have been raised, I will go to Galilee ahead of you." 
40Mt 26:33 But Peter said to him, "Even if everyone else turns against you, I certainly won't!"
40Mt 26:34 Jesus said to him, "I tell you with certainty, before a rooster crows this very night, you will deny me three times." 
40Mt 26:35 Peter told him, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!" And all the disciples said the same thing.
40Mt 26:36 Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane. He said to the disciples, "Sit down here while I go over there and pray."
40Mt 26:37 Taking Peter and the two sons of Zebedee with him, he began to be grieved and troubled.
40Mt 26:38 Then he said to them, "I'm so deeply grieved that I feel I'm about to die. Wait here and stay awake with me." 
40Mt 26:39 Going on a little farther, he fell on his face and prayed, "O my Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me. Yet not what I want but what you want." 
40Mt 26:40 When he went back to the disciples, he found them asleep. He said to Peter, "So, you men couldn't stay awake with me for one hour, could you - 
40Mt 26:41 All of you must stay awake and pray that you won't be tempted. The spirit is indeed willing, but the body is weak."40
40Mt 26:42 He went away a second time and prayed, "My Father, if this cup cannot go away unless I drink it, let your will be done."
40Mt 26:43 Then he came back and found them asleep, because they could not keep their eyes open.
40Mt 26:44 After leaving them again, he went away and prayed again for the third time, saying the same thing.
40Mt 26:45 Then he came back to the disciples and said to them, "You might as well keep on sleeping and resting. Look! The time is near for the Son of Man to be betrayed into the hands of sinners.
40Mt 26:46 Get up! Let's go! See, the one who is betraying me is near!"
40Mt 26:47 Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived. A large crowd armed with swords and clubs was with him. They were from the high priests and elders of the people.
40Mt 26:48 Now the betrayer personally had given them a signal, saying, "The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him."
40Mt 26:49 So Judas immediately went up to Jesus and said, "Hello, Rabbi!" and kissed him tenderly. 
40Mt 26:50 Jesus asked him, "Friend, why are you here?" Then the other men surged forward, took hold of Jesus, and arrested him. 
40Mt 26:51 Suddenly, one of the men with Jesus reached out his hand, drew his sword, and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
40Mt 26:52 Jesus said to him, "Put your sword back in its place! Everyone who uses a sword will be killed by a sword.
40Mt 26:53 Don't you think that I could call on my Father, and he would send me more than twelve legions of angels now - 
40Mt 26:54 How, then, would the Scriptures be fulfilled that say this must happen?" 
40Mt 26:55 At this point, Jesus asked the crowds, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a bandit? Day after day I sat teaching in the temple, yet you didn't arrest me.
40Mt 26:56 But all of this has happened so that the writings of the prophets might be fulfilled." Then all the disciples deserted Jesus and ran away. 
40Mt 26:57 Those who had arrested Jesus took him to Caiaphas, the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had assembled.
40Mt 26:58 Peter, however, followed him at a distance as far as the high priest's courtyard. He went inside and sat down with the servants to see how this would end.
40Mt 26:59 Meanwhile, the high priests and the whole Council were looking for false testimony against Jesus in order to have him put to death.
40Mt 26:60 But they couldn't find any, even though many false witnesses had come forward. At last two men came forward
40Mt 26:61 and stated, "This man said, 'I can destroy the sanctuary of God and rebuild it in three days.'" 
40Mt 26:62 At this, the high priest stood up and asked Jesus, "Don't you have any answer to what these men are testifying against you?"
40Mt 26:63 But Jesus was silent. Then the high priest said to him, "I command you by the living God to tell us if you are the Messiah, the Son of God!" 
40Mt 26:64 Jesus said to him, "You have said so. Nevertheless I tell you, from now on you will see 'the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power' and 'coming on the clouds of heaven.'"
40Mt 26:65 Then the high priest tore his robes and said, "He has blasphemed! Why do we still need witnesses? Listen! You yourselves have just heard the blasphemy!
40Mt 26:66 What is your verdict?" They replied, "He deserves to die!"
40Mt 26:67 Then they spit in his face and hit him. Some slapped him,
40Mt 26:68 saying, "Prophesy to us, you Messiah! Who hit you?"
40Mt 26:69 Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard when a servant girl came up to him and said, "You, too, were with Jesus the Galilean."26
40Mt 26:70 But he denied it in front of them all, saying, "I don't know what you're talking about."
40Mt 26:71 As he went out to the gateway, another woman saw him and said to those who were there, "This man was with Jesus from Nazareth."
40Mt 26:72 Again he denied it and swore with an oath, "I don't know the man!"
40Mt 26:73 After a little while the people who were standing there came up and said to Peter, "Obviously you're also one of them, because your accent gives you away."26
40Mt 26:74 Then he began to curse violently. "I don't know the man!" he swore solemnly. Just then a rooster crowed.
40Mt 26:75 Peter remembered the words of Jesus when he said, "Before a rooster crows, you will deny me three times." Then he went outside and cried bitterly. 
40Mt 27:1 When morning came, all the high priests and elders of the people conspired against Jesus to put him to death.
40Mt 27:2 They bound him with chains, led him away, and handed him over to Pontius Pilate, the governor. 
40Mt 27:3 Then Judas, who had betrayed him, regretted what had happened when he saw that Jesus was condemned. He brought the 30 pieces of silver back to the high priests and elders,
40Mt 27:4 saying, "I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."But they replied, "What do we care? Attend to that yourself."
40Mt 27:5 Then he flung the pieces of silver into the sanctuary and went outside. Then he went away and hanged himself. 
40Mt 27:6 The high priests picked up the pieces of silver and said, "It is not lawful to put this into the temple treasury, because it is blood money."
40Mt 27:7 So they decided to use the money to buy the Potter's Field as a burial ground for foreigners.
40Mt 27:8 That is why that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day.
40Mt 27:9 Then what had been declared through the prophet Jeremiah was fulfilled when he said, "They took the30 pieces of silver, the value of the man on whom a price had been set by the Israelites,
40Mt 27:10 and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord commanded me."
40Mt 27:11 Meanwhile, Jesus was made to stand in front of the governor. The governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?"Jesus said, "You say so." 
40Mt 27:12 While Jesus was being accused by the high priests and elders, he made no reply.
40Mt 27:13 Then Pilate asked him, "Don't you hear how many charges they're bringing against you?"
40Mt 27:14 But Jesus did not reply at all, so that the governor was very surprised.
40Mt 27:15 At every festival the governor had a custom of releasing to the crowd any prisoner whom they wanted.
40Mt 27:16 At that time they were holding a notorious prisoner named Barabbas.
40Mt 27:17 So when the people had gathered, Pilate asked them, "Which man do you want me to release for you - Barabbas, or Jesus who is called the Messiah?"
40Mt 27:18 He did this because he knew that they had handed him over out of jealousy.
40Mt 27:19 While he was sitting on the judge's seat, his wife sent him a message. It said, "Have nothing to do with that righteous man, because today I have suffered terribly due to a dream I had about him."
40Mt 27:20 But the high priests and elders persuaded the crowds to ask for Barabbas and to demand that Jesus be put to death.
40Mt 27:21 So the governor asked them, "Which of the two men do you want me to release for you?" "Barabbas!" they replied.
40Mt 27:22 Pilate asked them, "Then what should I do with Jesus, who is called the Messiah?" They all said, "Let him be crucified!"
40Mt 27:23 He asked, "What has he done wrong?"But they kept shouting louder and louder, "Let him be crucified!"
40Mt 27:24 Pilate saw that he was getting nowhere, but that a riot was about to break out instead. So he took some water and washed his hands in front of the crowd, saying, "I am innocent of this man's blood. Attend to that yourselves." 
40Mt 27:25 All the people answered, "Let his blood be on us and our children!"
40Mt 27:26 Then he released Barabbas for them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified. 
40Mt 27:27 Then the governor's soldiers took Jesus into the imperial headquarters and gathered the whole company of soldiers around him.
40Mt 27:28 They stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him.
40Mt 27:29 Twisting some thorns into a victor's crown, they placed it on his head and put a stick in his right hand. They knelt down in front of him and began making fun of him, saying, "Long live the king of the Jews!"
40Mt 27:30 Then they spit on him and took the stick and hit him repeatedly on his head. 
40Mt 27:31 When they had finished making fun of him, they stripped him of the robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to crucify him. 
40Mt 27:32 As they were leaving, they found a man from Cyrene named Simon, whom they forced to carry Jesus' cross.
40Mt 27:33 When they came to a place called Golgotha (which means "Skull Place"),
40Mt 27:34 they offered him a drink of wine mixed with gall. But when he tasted it, he refused to drink it.
40Mt 27:35 After they had crucified him, they determined who would get his clothes by throwing dice for them.
40Mt 27:36 Then they sat down there and continued guarding him.
40Mt 27:37 Above his head they placed the charge against him. It read, "This is Jesus, the king of the Jews." 
40Mt 27:38 At that time two bandits were crucified with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
40Mt 27:39 Those who passed by kept insulting him, shaking their heads,
40Mt 27:40 and saying, "You who were going to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days - save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross!"
40Mt 27:41 In the same way the high priests, along with the scribes and elders, were also making fun of him. They kept saying,
40Mt 27:42 "He saved others but can't save himself! He is the king of Israel. Let him come down from the cross now, and we will believe in him.
40Mt 27:43 He trusts in God. Let God rescue him, if he wants to do so now. After all, he said, 'I am the Son of God,'"42
40Mt 27:44 In a similar way, the bandits who were being crucified with him kept insulting him. 
40Mt 27:45 From noon on, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
40Mt 27:46 About three o'clock, Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani?", which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
40Mt 27:47 When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, "He's calling for Elijah."
40Mt 27:48 So one of the men ran off at once, took a sponge, and soaked it in some sour wine. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink. 
40Mt 27:49 But the others kept saying, "Wait! Let's see if Elijah will come and save him."
40Mt 27:50 Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice again and died.
40Mt 27:51 Suddenly the curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom, the earth shook, rocks were split open,
40Mt 27:52 tombs were opened, and many saints who had died were brought back to life.
40Mt 27:53 After his resurrection, they came out of their tombs and went into the Holy City and appeared to many people.
40Mt 27:54 When the centurion and those guarding Jesus with him saw the earthquake and the other things that were taking place, they were terrified and said, "This man certainly was the Son of God!" 
40Mt 27:55 Now many women were also there, watching from a distance. They had accompanied Jesus from Galilee and had ministered to him.
40Mt 27:56 Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James and Joseph, and the mother of Zebedee's sons. 
40Mt 27:57 Later that evening, a rich man arrived from Arimathea. His name was Joseph, and he had become a disciple of Jesus.
40Mt 27:58 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus, and Pilate ordered it to be done.
40Mt 27:59 So Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen cloth.
40Mt 27:60 Then he placed it in his own new tomb, which he had cut out of the rock. After rolling a large stone across the door of the tomb, he left,
40Mt 27:61 but Mary Magdalene and the other Mary remained there, sitting in front of the tomb.
40Mt 27:62 The following day (that is, after the Day of Preparation), the high priests and Pharisees gathered before Pilate
40Mt 27:63 and said, "Sir, we remember how that impostor said while he was still alive, 'After three days I will be raised.'
40Mt 27:64 Therefore, order the tomb to be secured until the third day, or his disciples may go and steal him and then tell the people, 'He has been raised from the dead.' Then the last deception would be worse than the first one."27
40Mt 27:65 Pilate told them, "You have a military guard. Go and make the tomb as secure as you know how."
40Mt 27:66 So they went and secured the tomb by putting a seal on the stone in the presence of the guards. 
40Mt 28:1 After the Sabbaths, around dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to take a look at the burial site.
40Mt 28:2 Suddenly there was a powerful earthquake, because an angel of the Lord had come down from heaven, approached the stone, rolled it away, and was sitting on top of it.
40Mt 28:3 His appearance was bright as lightning, and his clothes were white as snow.
40Mt 28:4 Trembling from fear, even the guards themselves became catatonic.2
40Mt 28:5 Responding to the women, the angel said, "Stop being frightened! I know you're looking for Jesus, who was crucified.
40Mt 28:6 He is not here. He has been raised, just as he said. Come and see the place where he was lying.
40Mt 28:7 Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. He is going ahead of you into Galilee, and you will see him there. Remember, I have told you!"
40Mt 28:8 So they quickly left the tomb, terrified but also ecstatic, and ran to tell Jesus' disciples.
40Mt 28:9 Suddenly Jesus met them and said, "Greetings!" They went up to him, took hold of his feet, and worshiped him.
40Mt 28:10 Then Jesus said to them, "Stop being frightened! Go and tell my brothers to leave for Galilee, and they will see me there."
40Mt 28:11 While the women were on their way, some of the guards went into the city and told the high priests everything that had happened.
40Mt 28:12 So they met with the elders and agreed on a plan to give the soldiers a large amount of money.
40Mt 28:13 They said, "Say that Jesus' disciples came at night and stole him while you were sleeping.
40Mt 28:14 If this is reported to the governor, we'll personally persuade him to keep you out of trouble."
40Mt 28:15 So the soldiers took the money, did as they were instructed, and this story has been spread among the Jews to this day.13
40Mt 28:16 The eleven disciples went into Galilee to the hillside to which Jesus had directed them.
40Mt 28:17 When they saw him, they worshiped him, though some had doubts.
40Mt 28:18 Then Jesus came up and said to them, "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
40Mt 28:19 Therefore, as you go, disciple people in all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
40Mt 28:20 teaching them to obey everything that I've commanded you. And remember, I am with you each and every day until the end of the age."

41Mk 1:1 This is the beginning of the gospel of Jesus the Messiah, the Son of God.
41Mk 1:2 As it is written in the prophet Isaiah, "See! I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way.
41Mk 1:3 He is a voice calling out in the wilderness£º 'Prepare the way for the Lord! Make his paths straight!'"
41Mk 1:4 John was baptizing in the wilderness, proclaiming a baptism about repentance for the forgiveness of sins.
41Mk 1:5 People from the whole Judean countryside and all the people of Jerusalem were flocking to him, being baptized by him while they confessed their sins.
41Mk 1:6 Now John was dressed in camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist. He ate locusts and wild honey.
41Mk 1:7 He kept proclaiming, "The one who is coming after me is stronger than I am, and I am not worthy to bend down and untie his sandal straps.
41Mk 1:8 I baptized you with water, but it is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit." 
41Mk 1:9 In those days Jesus came from Nazareth in Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan.
41Mk 1:10 Just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens split open and the Spirit descending on him like a dove.
41Mk 1:11 Then a voice came from heaven£º "You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you!" 
41Mk 1:12 At once the Spirit drove him into the wilderness.
41Mk 1:13 He was in the wilderness for40 days being tempted by Satan. He was among wild animals, and angels were ministering to him. 
41Mk 1:14 Now after John had been arrested, Jesus went to Galilee and proclaimed the gospel about the kingdom of God.
41Mk 1:15 He said, "The time is now! The kingdom of God is near! Repent, and keep believing the gospel!" 
41Mk 1:16 While Jesus was walking beside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and his brother Andrew. They were throwing a net into the sea because they were fishermen.
41Mk 1:17 Jesus said to them, "Follow me, and I will make you fishermen of people!"
41Mk 1:18 So immediately they left their nets and followed him.
41Mk 1:19 Going on a little farther he saw James, the son of Zebedee, and his brother John. They were in a boat repairing their nets.
41Mk 1:20 He immediately called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired men and followed him.
41Mk 1:21 Then they went to Capernaum. As soon as it was the Sabbath, Jesus went into the synagogue and began to teach.
41Mk 1:22 The people were utterly amazed at his teaching, because he was teaching them like one with authority and not like their scribes.
41Mk 1:23 Suddenly there was a man in their synagogue who had an unclean spirit. He screamed,
41Mk 1:24 "What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are - the Holy One of God!" 
41Mk 1:25 But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!"
41Mk 1:26 At this, the unclean spirit shook the man, cried out with a loud voice, and came out of him. 
41Mk 1:27 All the people were so stunned that they kept saying to each other, "What is this? A new teaching with authority! He tells even the unclean spirits what to do, and they obey him!"
41Mk 1:28 At once his fame began to spread throughout the surrounding region of Galilee.
41Mk 1:29 After they left the synagogue, they went directly to the house of Simon and Andrew, along with James and John.
41Mk 1:30 Now Simon's mother-in-law was lying in bed, sick with a fever, so they promptly told Jesus about her.
41Mk 1:31 He went up to her, took her by the hand, and helped her up. The fever left her, and she began serving them.
41Mk 1:32 When evening came, after the sun had set, people started bringing to him everyone who was sick or possessed by demons.
41Mk 1:33 In fact, the whole city gathered at the door.
41Mk 1:34 He healed many who were sick with various diseases and drove out many demons. However, he wouldn't allow the demons to speak because they knew who he was. 
41Mk 1:35 In the morning, while it was still very dark, Jesus got up and went to a deserted place and prayed there.
41Mk 1:36 Simon and his companions searched frantically for him.
41Mk 1:37 When they found him, they told him, "Everyone's looking for you."
41Mk 1:38 "Let's go to the neighboring town," he replied, "so I can preach there, too, because that's why I came."
41Mk 1:39 So he went throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons. 
41Mk 1:40 Then a leper came to Jesus and began pleading with him. He fell on his knees and said to him, "If you want to, you can make me clean."1
41Mk 1:41 Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out his hand, touched him, and said to him, "I do want to. Be made clean!"
41Mk 1:42 Instantly the leprosy left him, and he was clean.
41Mk 1:43 Then Jesus sternly warned him and encouraged him to go at once,
41Mk 1:44 saying to him, "Be sure that you don't tell anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest, and then offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded as proof to the authorities."
41Mk 1:45 But when the man left, he began to proclaim it freely. He spread the news so widely that Jesus could no longer enter a town openly, but had to stay out in deserted places. Still, people kept coming to him from everywhere. 
41Mk 2:1 Several days later, Jesus returned to Capernaum and it was reported that he was at home.
41Mk 2:2 Such a large crowd gathered that there wasn't room for them, even in front of the door. Jesus was speaking his message to them
41Mk 2:3 when some people came and brought him a paralyzed man being carried by four men.
41Mk 2:4 Since they couldn't bring him to Jesus because of the crowd, they made an opening in the roof over the place where he was. They dug through it and let down the mat on which the paralyzed man was lying.
41Mk 2:5 When Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralyzed man, "Son, your sins are forgiven."
41Mk 2:6 Now some scribes were sitting there, arguing among themselves,
41Mk 2:7 "Why does this man talk this way? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone?" 
41Mk 2:8 At once, Jesus knew in his spirit what they were saying to themselves. "Why are you arguing about such things among yourselves?" he asked them.
41Mk 2:9 "Which is easier£º to say to the paralyzed man, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up, pick up your mat, and walk' - 
41Mk 2:10 But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins. Then he said to the paralyzed man,
41Mk 2:11 "I say to you, get up, pick up your mat, and go home!"
41Mk 2:12 So the man got up, immediately picked up his mat, and went out in front of all of them. As a result, all of the people were amazed and began to glorify God, saying, "We have never seen anything like this!"
41Mk 2:13 Jesus went out again beside the sea. The whole crowd kept coming to him, and he kept teaching them.
41Mk 2:14 As he was walking along, he saw Levi, the son of Alphaeus, sitting at the tax collector's desk. Jesus said to him, "Follow me!" So Levi got up and followed him. 
41Mk 2:15 Later he was having dinner at Levi's house. Many tax collectors and sinners were also eating with Jesus and his disciples, because there were many who were following him.
41Mk 2:16 When the scribes and the Pharisees saw him eating with sinners and tax collectors, they asked his disciples, "Why does he eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
41Mk 2:17 When Jesus heard that, he said to them, "Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick ones do. I did not come to call righteous people, but sinners." 
41Mk 2:18 Now John's disciples and the Pharisees would fast regularly. Some people came and asked Jesus, "Why do John's disciples and the Pharisees' disciples fast, but your disciples don't fast?" 
41Mk 2:19 Jesus replied, "The wedding guests can't fast while the groom is with them, can they? As long as they have the groom with them, they can't fast.
41Mk 2:20 But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and then they will fast on that day."
41Mk 2:21 "No one patches an old garment with a piece of unshrunk cloth. If he does, the patch pulls away from it - the new from the old - and a worse tear is made.
41Mk 2:22 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will make the skins burst, and both the wine and the skins will be ruined. Instead, new wine is poured into fresh wineskins."
41Mk 2:23 Jesus happened to be going through the grain fields on a Sabbath. As they made their way, his disciples began picking the heads of grain.
41Mk 2:24 The Pharisees asked him, "Look! Why are they doing what is not lawful on Sabbath days?"
41Mk 2:25 He asked them, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need - 
41Mk 2:26 How was it that he went into the House of God during the lifetime of Abiathar the high priest and ate the Bread of the Presence, which was not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat, and gave some of it to his companions?"
41Mk 2:27 Then he said to them, "The Sabbath was made for people, not people for the Sabbath.
41Mk 2:28 Therefore, the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath." 
41Mk 3:1 Jesus went into the synagogue again, and a man with a paralyzed hand was there.
41Mk 3:2 The people watched Jesus closely to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, intending to accuse him of doing something wrong.
41Mk 3:3 He said to the man with the paralyzed hand, "Come forward."
41Mk 3:4 Then he asked them, "Is it lawful to do good or to do evil on Sabbath days, to save a life or to destroy it?" But they remained silent.3
41Mk 3:5 Jesus looked around at them in anger, deeply hurt because of their hard hearts. Then he said to the man, "Hold out your hand." The man held it out, and his hand was restored to health.
41Mk 3:6 Immediately the Pharisees and Herodians went out and began to plot how to kill him.
41Mk 3:7 So Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea. A large crowd from Galilee, Judea,
41Mk 3:8 Jerusalem, Idumea, from across the Jordan, and from the region around Tyre and Sidon followed him. They came to him because they kept hearing about everything he was doing.
41Mk 3:9 Jesus told his disciples to have a boat ready for him so that the crowd wouldn't crush him,
41Mk 3:10 because he had healed so many people that everyone who had diseases kept crowding up against him in order to touch him.
41Mk 3:11 Whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they would fall down in front of him and scream, "You are the Son of God!"
41Mk 3:12 But he sternly ordered them again and again not to tell people who he was. 
41Mk 3:13 Then Jesus went up on a hillside and called to himself those whom he had decided on, and they approached him.
41Mk 3:14 He appointed twelve disciples, whom he called apostles, to accompany him, to be sent out to preach,
41Mk 3:15 and to have the authority to drive out demons.
41Mk 3:16 He appointed these twelve men£º Simon (whom he named Peter),
41Mk 3:17 Zebedee's sons James and his brother John (whom he named Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder),
41Mk 3:18 Andrew, Philip, Bartholomew, Matthew, Thomas, James son of Alphaeus, Thaddeus, Simon the Cananaean,
41Mk 3:19 and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed him.13
41Mk 3:20 Then he went home. Such a large crowd gathered again that Jesus and his disciples couldn't even eat.
41Mk 3:21 When his family heard about it, they went to restrain him, because they kept saying, "He's out of his mind!" 
41Mk 3:22 The scribes who had come down from Jerusalem kept repeating, "He has Beelzebul," and "He drives out demons by the ruler of demons." 
41Mk 3:23 So Jesus called them together and began to speak to them in parables. "How can Satan drive out Satan - 
41Mk 3:24 If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand.
41Mk 3:25 And if a household is divided against itself, that household will not stand.
41Mk 3:26 So if Satan rebels against himself and is divided, he cannot stand. Indeed, his end has come.
41Mk 3:27 No one can go into a strong man's house and carry off his possessions without first tying up the strong man. Then he can ransack his house.
41Mk 3:28 I tell you with certainty, people will be forgiven their sins and whatever blasphemies they utter.
41Mk 3:29 But whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit can never be forgiven, but is guilty of eternal sin."
41Mk 3:30 For they had been saying, "He has an unclean spirit."
41Mk 3:31 Then his mother and his brothers arrived. Milling around outside, they sent for him, continually summoning him.
41Mk 3:32 A crowd was sitting around him. They said to him, "Look! Your mother and your brothers are outside asking for you."3
41Mk 3:33 He answered them, "Who are my mother and my brothers?"
41Mk 3:34 Then looking at the people sitting around him, he said, "Here are my mother and my brothers!
41Mk 3:35 Whoever does the will of God is my brother and sister and mother."
41Mk 4:1 Then Jesus began to teach again beside the sea. Such a large crowd gathered around him that he got into a boat and sat in it, while the entire crowd remained beside the sea on the shore.
41Mk 4:2 He began teaching them many things in parables. While he was teaching them he said,
41Mk 4:3 "Listen! A farmer went out to sow.
41Mk 4:4 As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, and birds came and ate them up.
41Mk 4:5 Others fell on stony ground, where they did not have a lot of soil. They sprouted at once because the soil wasn't deep.
41Mk 4:6 But when the sun came up, they were scorched. Since they did not have any roots, they dried up.
41Mk 4:7 Others fell among thorn bushes, and the thorn bushes came up and choked them out, and they did not produce anything.
41Mk 4:8 But others fell on good soil and produced a crop. They grew up, increased in size, and produced30 ,60 , or10 0 times what was sown."
41Mk 4:9 He added, "Let the person who has ears to hear, listen!"
41Mk 4:10 When he was alone with the twelve disciples and those around him, they began to ask him about the parables.
41Mk 4:11 He said to them, "The secret about the kingdom of God has been given to you. But to those on the outside, everything comes in parables
41Mk 4:12 so that 'they may see clearly but not perceive, and they may hear clearly but not understand, otherwise they might turn around and be forgiven.'"
41Mk 4:13 Then he said to them, "You don't understand this parable, so how can you understand any of the parables - 
41Mk 4:14 The farmer sows the word.
41Mk 4:15 Some people are like the seeds along the path, where the word is sown. When they hear it, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that was sown in them.
41Mk 4:16 Others are like the seeds sown on the stony ground. When they hear the word, at once they joyfully accept it,
41Mk 4:17 but since they don't have any roots, they last for only a short time. When trouble or persecution comes along because of the word, they immediately fall away.
41Mk 4:18 Still others are like the seeds sown among the thorn bushes. These are the people who hear the word,
41Mk 4:19 but the worries of life, the deceitful pleasures of wealth, and the desires for other things come in and choke the word so that it can't produce a crop.
41Mk 4:20 Others are like the seeds sown on good soil. They hear the word, accept it, and produce crops - 30 ,60 , or10 0 times what was sown."
41Mk 4:21 Then Jesus said to them, "A lamp isn't brought indoors to be put under a basket or under a bed, is it? It's to be put on a lamp stand, isn't it - 
41Mk 4:22 Nothing is hidden except for the purpose of having it revealed, and nothing is secret except for the purpose of having it come to light.
41Mk 4:23 If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen!" 
41Mk 4:24 He went on to say to them, "Pay attention to what you're hearing! You will be evaluated by the same standard with which you do your evaluating, and still more will be given to you,
41Mk 4:25 because whoever has something, will have more given to him. But whoever has nothing, even what he has will be taken away." 
41Mk 4:26 He was also saying, "The kingdom of God is like a man who scatters seeds on the ground.
41Mk 4:27 He sleeps and gets up night and day while the seeds sprout and grow, although he doesn't know how.
41Mk 4:28 The ground produces grain by itself, first the stalk, then the head, then the full grain in the head.
41Mk 4:29 But when the grain is ripe, he immediately starts cutting with his sickle because the harvest time has come."
41Mk 4:30 He was also saying, "How can we show what the kingdom of God is like, or what parable can we use to describe it - 
41Mk 4:31 It is like a mustard seed planted in the ground. Although it is the smallest of all the seeds on earth,
41Mk 4:32 when it is planted it comes up and becomes larger than all the garden plants. It grows such large branches that the birds in the sky can nest in its shade."
41Mk 4:33 With many other parables like these, Jesus kept speaking his message to them according to their ability to understand.
41Mk 4:34 He did not tell them anything without using a parable, though he explained everything to his disciples in private.
41Mk 4:35 That day, when evening had come, he said to them, "Let's cross to the other side."
41Mk 4:36 So they left the crowd and took him away in a boat without making any special preparations. Other boats were with him.
41Mk 4:37 A violent windstorm came up, and the waves began breaking into the boat, so that the boat was rapidly becoming swamped.
41Mk 4:38 But Jesus was in the back of the boat, asleep on a cushion. So they woke him up and asked him, "Teacher, don't you care that we're going to die?"
41Mk 4:39 Then he got up, rebuked the wind, and said to the sea, "Calm down! Be still!" Then the wind stopped blowing, and there was a great calm.
41Mk 4:40 He asked them, "Why are you such cowards? Don't you have any faith yet?"
41Mk 4:41 Overcome with fear, they kept saying to one another, "Who is this man? Even the wind and the sea obey him!"4
41Mk 5:1 They arrived at the other side of the sea in the territory of the Gerasenes.
41Mk 5:2 Just as Jesus stepped out of the boat, a man with an unclean spirit came out of the tombs and met him.
41Mk 5:3 He lived among the tombs, and no one could restrain him any longer, not even with a chain.
41Mk 5:4 He had often been restrained with shackles and chains but had snapped the chains apart and broken the shackles in pieces. No one could tame him.
41Mk 5:5 Night and day he kept screaming among the tombs and on the mountainsides and kept cutting himself with stones.
41Mk 5:6 When he saw Jesus from a distance, he ran and fell down in front of him,
41Mk 5:7 screaming in a loud voice, "What do you want with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you in the name of God never to torment me!"
41Mk 5:8 Jesus had been saying to him, "Come out of the man, you unclean spirit!"
41Mk 5:9 Then Jesus asked him, "What's your name?" He said to him, "My name is Legion, because there are many of us."
41Mk 5:10 He kept pleading with Jesus not to send them out of that region.
41Mk 5:11 Now a large herd of pigs was grazing on a hillside nearby.
41Mk 5:12 So the demons begged him, "Send us among the pigs, so that we can go into them!"
41Mk 5:13 So he let them do this. The unclean spirits came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd of about 2,000 rushed down the cliff into the sea and drowned there.
41Mk 5:14 Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs ran away, they reported what had happened in the city and countryside. So the people went to see what had happened.
41Mk 5:15 When they came to Jesus and saw the man who had been possessed by the legion of demons, sitting there dressed and in his right mind, they were frightened.
41Mk 5:16 The people who had seen it told them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and the pigs.
41Mk 5:17 So they began to beg Jesus to leave their territory.
41Mk 5:18 As Jesus was getting into the boat, the man who had been demon-possessed kept begging him to let him go with him.
41Mk 5:19 But Jesus wouldn't let him. Instead, he told him, "Go home to your family, and tell them how much the Lord has done for you and how merciful he has been to you."
41Mk 5:20 So the man left and began proclaiming in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him. And everyone was utterly amazed.
41Mk 5:21 When Jesus again had crossed to the other side in a boat, a large crowd gathered around him by the seashore.
41Mk 5:22 Then a synagogue leader named Jairus arrived. When he saw Jesus, he fell at his feet
41Mk 5:23 and begged him urgently, saying, "My little daughter is dying. Come and lay your hands on her so that she may get well and live."
41Mk 5:24 So Jesus went with him. A huge crowd kept following him and jostling him.
41Mk 5:25 Now there was a woman who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years.
41Mk 5:26 Although she had endured a great deal under the care of many doctors and had spent all of her money, she had not been helped at all but rather grew worse.
41Mk 5:27 Since she had heard about Jesus, she came up behind him in the crowd and touched his robe,
41Mk 5:28 because she had been saying, "If I can just touch his robe, I will get well."
41Mk 5:29 Her bleeding stopped at once, and she felt in her body that she was healed from her illness.
41Mk 5:30 Immediately Jesus became aware that power had gone out of him. So he turned around in the crowd and asked, "Who touched my clothes?" 
41Mk 5:31 His disciples asked him, "You see the crowd jostling you, and yet you ask, 'Who touched me?'"
41Mk 5:32 But he kept looking around to see the woman who had done this.
41Mk 5:33 So the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came forward fearfully, fell down trembling in front of him, and told him the whole truth.
41Mk 5:34 He said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace and be healed from your illness." 
41Mk 5:35 While he was still speaking, some people came from the synagogue leader's home and said, "Your daughter is dead. Why bother the Teacher anymore?" 
41Mk 5:36 But when Jesus heard what they said, he told the synagogue leader, "Stop being afraid! Just keep on believing."
41Mk 5:37 Jesus allowed no one to go further with him except Peter, James, and John, the brother of James.
41Mk 5:38 When they came to the home of the synagogue leader, Jesus saw mass confusion. People were crying and sobbing loudly.
41Mk 5:39 He entered the house and asked them, "Why all this confusion and crying? The child isn't dead. She's sleeping."
41Mk 5:40 They laughed and laughed at him. But when he had driven all of them outside, he took the child's father and mother, along with the men who were with him, and went into the room where the child was. 
41Mk 5:41 He took her by the hand and said to her, "Talitha koum," which means, "Young lady, I tell you, get up!"
41Mk 5:42 The young lady got up at once and started to walk. She was twelve years old. Instantly they were overcome with astonishment.
41Mk 5:43 But Jesus strictly ordered them not to let anyone know about this. He also told them to give her something to eat. 
41Mk 6:1 Jesus left that place and went back to his hometown, and his disciples followed him.
41Mk 6:2 When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were utterly amazed. "Where did this man get all these things?" they asked. "What is this wisdom that has been given to him? What great miracles are being done by his hands!
41Mk 6:3 This is the builder, the son of Mary, and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas, and Simon, isn't it? His sisters are here with us, aren't they?" And they were offended by him.2
41Mk 6:4 Jesus was telling them, "A prophet is without honor only in his hometown, among his relatives, and in his own home."
41Mk 6:5 He couldn't perform a miracle there except to lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.
41Mk 6:6 He was amazed at their unbelief. Then he went around to the villages and continued teaching. 
41Mk 6:7 He called the twelve disciples and began to send them out two by two, giving them authority over unclean spirits.
41Mk 6:8 He instructed them to take nothing along on the trip except a walking stick - no bread, no traveling bag, nothing in their moneybag.
41Mk 6:9 They could wear sandals but not take along an extra shirt.
41Mk 6:10 He told them repeatedly, "Whenever you go into a home, stay there until you leave that place.
41Mk 6:11 If any place will not welcome you and the people refuse to listen to you, when you leave, shake its dust off your feet as a testimony against them."
41Mk 6:12 So they went and preached that people should repent.
41Mk 6:13 They also kept driving out many demons and anointing with oil many who were sick, and healing them.11
41Mk 6:14 King Herod heard about this, because Jesus' name had become well-known. He was saying, "John the Baptist has been raised from the dead! That's why he is able to do these miracles." 
41Mk 6:15 Others were saying, "He is Elijah." Still others were saying, "He is a prophet like one of the other prophets." 
41Mk 6:16 But when Herod heard about it, he said, "John, whom I beheaded, has been raised,"
41Mk 6:17 because Herod himself had sent men who arrested John, bound him with chains, and put him in prison on account of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, whom Herod had married.
41Mk 6:18 John had been telling Herod, "It's not lawful for you to have your brother's wife."
41Mk 6:19 So Herodias bore a grudge against John and wanted to kill him. But she couldn't do it
41Mk 6:20 because Herod was afraid of John. He knew that John was a righteous and holy man, and so he protected him. Whenever he listened to John, he did much of what he said. In fact, he liked listening to him. 
41Mk 6:21 An opportunity came during Herod's birthday celebration, when he gave a banquet for his top officials, military officers, and the most important people of Galilee.
41Mk 6:22 When the daughter of Herodias came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. So the king told the girl, "Ask me for anything you want, and I'll give it to you."
41Mk 6:23 He swore with an oath to her, "I'll give you anything you ask for, up to half of my kingdom." 
41Mk 6:24 So she went out and asked her mother, "What should I ask for?"Her mother replied, "The head of John the Baptist."
41Mk 6:25 Immediately the girl hurried back to the king with her request, "I want you to give me right now the head of John the Baptist on a platter."
41Mk 6:26 The king was deeply saddened, yet because of his oaths and his guests he was reluctant to refuse her.
41Mk 6:27 So without delay the king sent a soldier and ordered him to bring John's head. The soldier went and beheaded him in prison.
41Mk 6:28 Then he brought John's head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother.
41Mk 6:29 When John's disciples heard about this, they came and carried off his body and laid it in a tomb.
41Mk 6:30 The apostles gathered around Jesus and told him everything they had done and taught.
41Mk 6:31 He said to them, "Come away to a deserted place all by yourselves and rest for a while," because so many people were coming and going that they didn't even have time to eat.
41Mk 6:32 So they went away in a boat to a deserted place by themselves.
41Mk 6:33 But when many people saw them leave and recognized them, they hurried on foot from all the towns and arrived ahead of them.
41Mk 6:34 When he got out of the boat, he saw a large crowd. He had compassion for them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd, and he began to teach them many things. 
41Mk 6:35 When it was quite late, his disciples came to him and said, "This is a deserted place, and it's already late.
41Mk 6:36 Send the crowds away so that they can go to the neighboring farms and villages and buy themselves something to eat."
41Mk 6:37 But he answered them, "You give them something to eat."They asked him, "Should we go and buy20 0 denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat?" 
41Mk 6:38 He asked them, "How many loaves of bread do you have? Go and see." They found out and told him, "Five loaves and two fish." 
41Mk 6:39 Then he ordered them to have all the people sit down in groups on the green grass.
41Mk 6:40 So they sat down in groups of hundreds and fifties.
41Mk 6:41 Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples to set before the people. He also divided the two fish among them all.
41Mk 6:42 All of them ate and were filled.
41Mk 6:43 Then the disciples picked up twelve baskets full of leftover bread and fish.
41Mk 6:44 There were 5,000 men who had eaten the loaves.
41Mk 6:45 Jesus immediately had his disciples get into a boat and cross to Bethsaida ahead of him, while he sent the crowd away.
41Mk 6:46 After saying goodbye to them, he went up on a hillside to pray.
41Mk 6:47 When evening had come, the boat was in the middle of the sea, while he was alone on the land.
41Mk 6:48 He saw that his disciples were straining at the oars, because the wind was against them. Shortly before dawn he came to them, walking on the sea. He intended to go up right beside them,
41Mk 6:49 but when they saw him walking on the sea, they thought it was a ghost and began to scream.
41Mk 6:50 All of them saw him and were terrified. Immediately he said to them, "Have courage! It is I. Stop being afraid!"47
41Mk 6:51 Then he got into the boat with them, and the wind stopped blowing. The disciples were utterly astounded,
41Mk 6:52 because they didn't understand the significance of the loaves. Instead, their hearts were hardened.456
41Mk 6:53 When they had crossed over, they came ashore at Gennesaret and anchored the boat.
41Mk 6:54 As soon as they got out of the boat, the people recognized Jesus.
41Mk 6:55 They ran all over the countryside and began carrying the sick on their mats to any place where they heard he was.
41Mk 6:56 Wherever he went, whether into villages, towns, or farms, people would place their sick in the marketplaces and beg him to let them touch even the tassel of his garment, and everyone who touched it was healed. 
41Mk 7:1 The Pharisees and some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem gathered around Jesus.
41Mk 7:2 They noticed that some of his disciples were eating with unclean hands, that is, without washing them.
41Mk 7:3 (The Pharisees - and indeed all the Jewish people - don't eat unless they wash their hands properly, following the tradition of their elders.
41Mk 7:4 They don't eat anything from the marketplace unless they dip it in water. They also observe many other traditions, such as the proper washing of washing cups, jars, brass pots, and dinner tables.)3
41Mk 7:5 So the Pharisees and the scribes asked Jesus, "Why don't your disciples live according to the tradition of the elders? Instead, they eat with unclean hands." 
41Mk 7:6 He told them, "Isaiah was right when he prophesied about you hypocrites. As it is written, 'These people honor me with their lips, but their hearts are far from me.
41Mk 7:7 Their worship of me is worthless, because they teach human rules as doctrines.'
41Mk 7:8 You abandon the commandment of God and hold to human tradition."
41Mk 7:9 Then he said to them, "You have such a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to keep your own tradition!
41Mk 7:10 Because Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and 'Whoever curses his father or mother must certainly be put to death.'
41Mk 7:11 But you say, 'If anyone tells his father or mother, "Whatever support you might have received from me is Corban," (that is, an offering to God)
41Mk 7:12 'you no longer let him do anything for his father or mother.'
41Mk 7:13 You are destroying the word of God through your tradition that you have handed down. And you do many other things like that."
41Mk 7:14 Then he called to the crowd again and said to them, "Listen to me, all of you, and understand!
41Mk 7:15 Nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean. It's what comes out of a person that makes a person unclean.
41Mk 7:16 If anyone has ears to hear, let him listen!"
41Mk 7:17 When he had left the crowd and gone home, his disciples began asking him about the parable.
41Mk 7:18 He asked them, "Are you so ignorant? Don't you know that nothing that goes into a person from the outside can make him unclean - 
41Mk 7:19 Because it doesn't go into his heart but into his stomach, and is expelled as waste." (By this he declared all foods clean.)
41Mk 7:20 He continued, "It's what comes out of a person that makes a person unclean,
41Mk 7:21 because it's from within, from the human heart, that evil thoughts come, as well as sexual immorality, stealing, murder,
41Mk 7:22 adultery, greed, wickedness, cheating, shameless lust, envy, slander, arrogance, and foolishness.
41Mk 7:23 All these things come from inside and make a person unclean."18
41Mk 7:24 Jesus left that place and went to the territory of Tyre and Sidon. He went into a house, not wanting anyone to know he was there. However, it couldn't be kept a secret.
41Mk 7:25 In fact, a woman whose little daughter had an unclean spirit immediately heard about him and came and fell down at his feet.
41Mk 7:26 Now the woman happened to be a Greek, born in Phoenicia in Syria. She kept asking him to drive the demon out of her daughter.
41Mk 7:27 But he kept telling her, "First let the children be filled. It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the puppies."
41Mk 7:28 But she answered him, "Yes, Lord. Yet even the puppies under the table eat some of the children's crumbs."
41Mk 7:29 Then he said to her, "Because you have said this, go! The demon has left your daughter."
41Mk 7:30 So she went home and found her child lying in bed, and the demon was gone.
41Mk 7:31 Then Jesus left the territory of Tyre and passed through Sidon towards the Sea of Galilee, in the territory of the Decapolis.
41Mk 7:32 Some people brought him a deaf man who also had a speech impediment. They begged him to lay his hand on him.
41Mk 7:33 Jesus took him away from the crowd to be alone with him. Putting his fingers into the man's ears, he touched the man's tongue with saliva.
41Mk 7:34 Then he looked up to heaven, sighed, and said to him, "Ephphatha," that is, "Be opened!"
41Mk 7:35 The man's hearing and speech were restored at once, and he began to talk normally.
41Mk 7:36 Jesus ordered the people not to tell anyone, but the more he kept ordering them, the more they kept spreading the news.7
41Mk 7:37 Amazed beyond measure, they kept on saying, "He does everything well! He even makes deaf people hear and mute people talk!"
41Mk 8:1 At that time, after a large crowd again had gathered together with nothing to eat, Jesus called his disciples and said to them,
41Mk 8:2 "I have compassion for the crowd because they have already been with me for three days and have nothing to eat.
41Mk 8:3 If I send them away to their homes hungry, they will faint on the road. Some of them have come a long distance."
41Mk 8:4 His disciples answered him, "Where could anyone get enough bread to feed these people out here in the wilderness?"
41Mk 8:5 He asked them, "How many loaves of bread do you have?" "Seven," they said. 
41Mk 8:6 So he ordered the crowd to sit down on the ground. Then he took the seven loaves and gave thanks. He broke them in pieces and kept giving them to his disciples to distribute. So they served them to the crowd.
41Mk 8:7 They also had a few small fish. He blessed them and said that the fish should also be distributed.
41Mk 8:8 The people ate and were filled. Then the disciples picked up the leftover pieces - seven large baskets full.
41Mk 8:9 Now about 4,000 men were there. Then he sent them on their way.
41Mk 8:10 Immediately he got into a boat with his disciples and went to the region of Dalmanutha.
41Mk 8:11 The Pharisees arrived and began arguing with Jesus. They tested him by demanding from him a sign from heaven.
41Mk 8:12 He sighed deeply in his spirit and remarked, "Why do those living today demand a sign? I tell you with certainty, no sign will be given to this generation."
41Mk 8:13 Leaving them, he got into a boat again and crossed to the other side.
41Mk 8:14 Now the disciples had forgotten to take any bread along, but they had one loaf with them in the boat.
41Mk 8:15 Jesus had been warning them, "Watch out! Beware of the yeast of the Pharisees and the yeast of Herod!"
41Mk 8:16 So they were discussing with one another the fact that they didn't have any bread.
41Mk 8:17 Knowing this, Jesus asked them, "Why are you discussing the fact that you don't have any bread? Don't you understand or perceive yet? Are your hearts hardened - 
41Mk 8:18 Do you have eyes but fail to see? Do you have ears but fail to hear? Don't you remember - 
41Mk 8:19 When I broke the five loaves for the 5,000, how many baskets did you fill with leftover pieces?" They told him, "Twelve." 
41Mk 8:20 "When I broke the seven loaves for the 4,000, how many large baskets did you fill with the leftover pieces?" They told him, "Seven." 
41Mk 8:21 Then he asked them, "Don't you understand yet?" 
41Mk 8:22 As they came to Bethsaida, some people brought a blind man to Jesus and begged him to touch him.
41Mk 8:23 Jesus took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. He spit into his eyes, placed his hands on him, and asked him, "Do you see anything?" 
41Mk 8:24 The man looked up and said, "I see people, but they look like trees walking around."
41Mk 8:25 Then Jesus placed his hands on the man's eyes again, and he saw clearly. His sight was restored, and he saw everything perfectly even from a distance.
41Mk 8:26 Then Jesus sent him home, saying, "Don't go into the village or tell anyone in the village."
41Mk 8:27 Then Jesus and his disciples set out for the villages around Caesarea Philippi. On the way he was asking his disciples, "Who do people say I am?" 
41Mk 8:28 They answered him, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others one of the prophets." 
41Mk 8:29 Then he began to ask them, "But who do you say I am?" Peter answered him, "You are the Messiah!"
41Mk 8:30 Jesus sternly ordered them not to tell anyone about him. 
41Mk 8:31 Then he began to teach them that the Son of Man would have to suffer a great deal and be rejected by the elders, the high priests, and the scribes. Then he would be killed, but after three days he would rise again.
41Mk 8:32 He was speaking about this matter quite openly. Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him.
41Mk 8:33 But turning and looking at his disciples, Jesus rebuked Peter, saying, "Get behind me, Satan, because you're not thinking God's thoughts but human thoughts!"
41Mk 8:34 Then Jesus called the crowd to himself along with his disciples and said to them, "If anyone wants to follow me, he must deny himself, pick up his cross, and follow me continually,
41Mk 8:35 because whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and for the gospel will save it.
41Mk 8:36 What profit will a person have if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life - 
41Mk 8:37 Indeed, what can a person give in exchange for his life - 
41Mk 8:38 If anyone is ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes with the holy angels in his Father's glory."8
41Mk 9:1 Then he said to them, "I tell you with certainty, some people standing here will not experience death until they see the kingdom of God arrive with power." 
41Mk 9:2 Six days later, Jesus took Peter, James, and John and led them up a high mountain to be alone with him. His appearance was changed in front of them,
41Mk 9:3 and his clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone on earth could bleach them.
41Mk 9:4 Then Elijah appeared to them, accompanied by Moses, and they were talking with Jesus.
41Mk 9:5 Then Peter said to Jesus, "Rabbi, it's good that we're here! Let's set up three shelters - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah."
41Mk 9:6 (Peter didn't know how to respond, because they were terrified.)
41Mk 9:7 Then a cloud appeared and overshadowed them. A voice came out of the cloud and said, "This is my Son, whom I love. Keep on listening to him!"
41Mk 9:8 Suddenly, as they looked around, they saw no one with them but Jesus alone.
41Mk 9:9 On their way down the mountain, Jesus ordered them not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.
41Mk 9:10 They kept the matter to themselves but argued about what "rising from the dead" meant.
41Mk 9:11 So they asked him, "Don't the scribes say that Elijah must come first?" 
41Mk 9:12 He told them, "Elijah is indeed coming first and will restore all things. Why, then, is it written that the Son of Man must suffer a great deal and be treated shamefully - 
41Mk 9:13 But I tell you that Elijah has come, yet people treated him just as they pleased, as it is written about him." 
41Mk 9:14 As they approached the other disciples, they saw a large crowd around them and some scribes arguing with them.
41Mk 9:15 The whole crowd was very surprised to see Jesus and ran to welcome him.
41Mk 9:16 He asked the scribes, "What are you arguing about with them?"
41Mk 9:17 A man in the crowd answered him, "Teacher, I brought my son to you. He has a spirit that won't let him talk.
41Mk 9:18 Whenever it brings on a seizure, it throws him to the ground. Then he foams at the mouth, grinds his teeth, and becomes stiff. So I asked your disciples to drive the spirit out, but they didn't have the power."
41Mk 9:19 Jesus said to them, "You unbelieving generation! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring him to me!"
41Mk 9:20 So they brought the boy to him. When the spirit saw Jesus, it immediately threw the boy into convulsions. He fell on the ground and kept rolling around and foaming at the mouth.
41Mk 9:21 Then Jesus asked his father, "How long has this been happening to him?" He said, "Since he was a child.
41Mk 9:22 The spirit has often thrown him into fire and into water to destroy him. But if you are able to do anything, have pity on us and help us!"21
41Mk 9:23 Jesus said to him, "'If you are able?' Everything is possible for the person who believes!" 
41Mk 9:24 With tears flowing, the child's father at once cried out, "I do believe! Help my unbelief!"
41Mk 9:25 When Jesus saw that a crowd was running to the scene, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, "You spirit that won't let him talk or hear - I command you to come out of him and never enter him again!"
41Mk 9:26 The spirit screamed, shook the child violently, and came out. The boy was like a corpse, and many said that he was dead.
41Mk 9:27 But Jesus took his hand and helped him up, and he stood up.
41Mk 9:28 When Jesus came home, his disciples asked him privately, "Why couldn't we drive the spirit out?" 
41Mk 9:29 He told them, "This kind can come out only by prayer and fasting."
41Mk 9:30 Then they left that place and passed through Galilee. Jesus didn't want anyone to find out about it,
41Mk 9:31 because he was teaching his disciples, "The Son of Man will be betrayed into human hands. They will kill him, but after being dead for three days he will be raised."
41Mk 9:32 They didn't understand what this statement meant, and they were afraid to ask him.
41Mk 9:33 Then they came to Capernaum. While Jesus was at home, he asked the disciples, "What were you arguing about on the road?"
41Mk 9:34 But they kept silent, because they had argued on the road with one another about who was the greatest.
41Mk 9:35 So he sat down, called his twelve disciples, and told them, "If anyone wants to be first he must be last of all and servant of all."
41Mk 9:36 Then he took a little child and had him stand among them. He took him in his arms and said to them,
41Mk 9:37 "Whoever welcomes a child like this in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes not me but the one who sent me." 
41Mk 9:38 John said to Jesus, "Teacher, we saw someone driving out demons in your name. We tried to stop him, because he wasn't a follower like us." 
41Mk 9:39 But Jesus said, "Don't stop him, because no one who works a miracle in my name can slander me soon afterwards.
41Mk 9:40 Whoever is not against us is for us.
41Mk 9:41 I tell you with certainty, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to the Messiah will never lose his reward." 
41Mk 9:42 "If anyone causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a large millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea.
41Mk 9:43 So if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life injured than to have two hands and go to hell, to the fire that cannot be put out.
41Mk 9:44 In that place, worms never die, and the fire is never put out.
41Mk 9:45 And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than to have two feet and be thrown into hell.
41Mk 9:46 In that place, worms never die, and the fire is never put out. 
41Mk 9:47 And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than to have two eyes and be thrown into hell.
41Mk 9:48 In that place, worms never die, and the fire is never put out.
41Mk 9:49 Because everyone will be salted with fire, and every sacrifice will be salted with salt.
41Mk 9:50 Salt is good. But if salt loses its taste, how can you restore its flavor? Keep on having salt among yourselves, and live in peace with one another." 
41Mk 10:1 Then Jesus left that place and went into the territory of Judea on the other side of the Jordan. Crowds gathered around him as usual, and he began to teach them again as was his custom.
41Mk 10:2 Some Pharisees came to test him. They asked, "Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife?" 
41Mk 10:3 He answered them, "What did Moses command you?"
41Mk 10:4 They said, "Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to divorce her."
41Mk 10:5 But Jesus said to them, "It was because of your hardness of heart that he wrote this command for you.
41Mk 10:6 But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.'
41Mk 10:7 'That is why a man will leave his father and mother and be united with his wife,
41Mk 10:8 and the two will become one flesh.' So they are no longer two, but one flesh.
41Mk 10:9 Therefore, what God has joined together, man must never separate."
41Mk 10:10 Back in the house, the disciples asked him about this again.
41Mk 10:11 So he said to them, "Whoever divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery against her.
41Mk 10:12 And if a woman divorces her husband and marries another man, she commits adultery."11
41Mk 10:13 Some people were bringing little children to Jesus to have him touch them. But the disciples rebuked those who brought them.
41Mk 10:14 When Jesus saw this, he became furious and told them, "Let the little children come to me, and stop keeping them away, because the kingdom of God belongs to people like these.
41Mk 10:15 I tell you with certainty, whoever doesn't receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never enter it."
41Mk 10:16 Then after he had hugged the children, he tenderly blessed them as he laid his hands on them.
41Mk 10:17 As Jesus was setting out again, a man ran up to him, knelt down in front of him, and asked him, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" 
41Mk 10:18 "Why do you call me good?" Jesus asked him. "Nobody is good except for one - God.
41Mk 10:19 You know the commandments£º 'Never murder.' 'Never commit adultery.' 'Never steal.' 'Never give false testimony.' 'Never cheat.' 'Honor your father and mother.'"
41Mk 10:20 The man replied to him, "Teacher, I have obeyed all of these since I was a young man."
41Mk 10:21 Jesus looked at him and loved him. Then he told him, "You're missing one thing. Go and sell everything you own, give the money to the destitute, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me."
41Mk 10:22 Shocked at this statement, the man went away sad, because he had many possessions.
41Mk 10:23 Then Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, "How hard it will be for those who are wealthy to enter the kingdom of God!"
41Mk 10:24 The disciples were startled by these words, but Jesus said to them again, "Children, how hard it is for those who trust in their wealth to get into the kingdom of God!
41Mk 10:25 It is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God."
41Mk 10:26 The disciples were utterly amazed and asked one another, "Then who can be saved?"
41Mk 10:27 Jesus looked at them intently and said, "For humans it is impossible, but not for God. All things are possible for God." 
41Mk 10:28 Then Peter began to say to him, "See, we have left everything and followed you." 
41Mk 10:29 Jesus said, "I tell you with certainty, there is no one who has left his home, brothers, sisters, mother, father, children, or fields because of me and the gospel
41Mk 10:30 who will not receive a hundred times as much here in this world - homes, brothers, sisters, mothers, children, and fields, along with persecution - as well as eternal life in the age to come.
41Mk 10:31 But many who are first will be last, and the last will be first."
41Mk 10:32 Now Jesus and his disciples had been on the road going up to Jerusalem, with Jesus walking ahead of them. They were astonished, and the others who followed were afraid. Once again, Jesus took the twelve disciples aside and began to tell them what was going to happen to him.
41Mk 10:33 "See, we are going up to Jerusalem. The Son of Man will be handed over to the high priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death. Then they will hand him over to the gentiles,
41Mk 10:34 and they will make fun of him, spit on him, whip him, and kill him. But after three days he will be raised."
41Mk 10:35 James and John, the sons of Zebedee, went to Jesus and said to him, "Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask you." 
41Mk 10:36 He asked them, "What do you want me to do for you?"
41Mk 10:37 They asked him, "Let us sit in your glory, one on your right and one on your left."
41Mk 10:38 But Jesus told them, "You don't realize what you're asking. Can you drink from the cup that I'm going to drink from or be baptized with the baptism with which I'm going to be baptized?"
41Mk 10:39 They told him, "We can." Jesus said to them, "You will drink from the cup that I'm going to drink and be baptized with the baptism with which I'm going to be baptized.
41Mk 10:40 But it's not up to me to grant you a seat at my right or my left. Those positions have already been prepared for others."
41Mk 10:41 When the ten other disciples heard this, they began to be furious with James and John.
41Mk 10:42 Jesus called his disciples and said to them, "You know that those who are recognized as rulers among the gentiles lord it over them, and their superiors act like tyrants over them.
41Mk 10:43 That's not the way it should be among you. Instead, whoever wants to become great among you must be your servant,
41Mk 10:44 and whoever wants to be first among you must be a slave to everyone,
41Mk 10:45 because even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many people."1043
41Mk 10:46 Then they came to Jericho. As Jesus, his disciples, and a large crowd were leaving Jericho, a blind beggar named Bartimaeus (the son of Timaeus) was sitting by the road.
41Mk 10:47 When he heard that Jesus of Nazareth was there, he began to shout, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
41Mk 10:48 Many people sternly told him to be quiet, but he started shouting even louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"
41Mk 10:49 So Jesus stopped and said, "Call him!" So they called the blind man and told him, "Have courage! Get up. He's calling you."
41Mk 10:50 He threw off his coat, jumped up, and went to Jesus.
41Mk 10:51 Then Jesus asked him, "What do you want me to do for you?" The blind man said to him, "Rabbouni, I want to see again."
41Mk 10:52 Jesus told him, "Go. Your faith has made you well." At once the man could see again, and he began to follow Jesus down the road. 
41Mk 11:1 When they came near Jerusalem, at Bethphage and Bethany, near the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples on ahead
41Mk 11:2 and said to them, "Go into the village ahead of you. As soon as you go into it, you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever ridden. Untie it, and bring it along.
41Mk 11:3 If anyone asks you, 'Why are you doing this - ,' say, 'The Lord needs it,' and he will send it back here at once."2
41Mk 11:4 So they went and found the colt outside in the street tied up next to a doorway. While they were untying it,
41Mk 11:5 some men standing there asked them, "What are you doing untying that colt?"
41Mk 11:6 The disciples told them what Jesus had said, and the men let them go.
41Mk 11:7 They brought the colt to Jesus and threw their coats upon it, and he sat on it.
41Mk 11:8 Many people spread their coats on the road, while others spread leafy branches that they had cut in the fields.
41Mk 11:9 Those who went ahead and those who followed him were shouting, "Hosanna! How blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!
41Mk 11:10 How blessed is the coming kingdom of our ancestor David! Hosanna in the highest heaven!"
41Mk 11:11 Then Jesus went into Jerusalem and into the temple and looked around at everything. Since it was already late, he went out with his twelve disciples to Bethany. 
41Mk 11:12 The next day, as they were leaving Bethany, Jesus became hungry.
41Mk 11:13 Seeing in the distance a fig tree covered with leaves, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing except leaves because it wasn't the season for figs.
41Mk 11:14 So he said to it, "May no one ever eat fruit from you again!" Now his disciples were listening to this.13
41Mk 11:15 When they came to Jerusalem, he went into the temple and began to throw out those who were selling and those who were buying in the temple. He overturned the moneychangers' tables and the chairs of those who sold doves.
41Mk 11:16 He wouldn't even let anyone carry a vessel through the temple.
41Mk 11:17 Then he began to teach them£º "It is written, is it not, 'My house is to be called a house of prayer for all nations'? But you have turned it into a hideout for bandits!"
41Mk 11:18 When the high priests and elders heard this, they began to look for a way to kill him, because they were afraid of him, since the whole crowd was amazed at his teaching.
41Mk 11:19 When evening came, Jesus and his disciples would leave the city.
41Mk 11:20 While they were walking along early the next morning, they saw the fig tree dried up to its roots.
41Mk 11:21 Remembering what Jesus had said, Peter pointed out to him, "Rabbi, look! The fig tree you cursed has dried up!"
41Mk 11:22 Jesus said to his disciples, "Have faith in God!
41Mk 11:23 I tell you with certainty, if anyone says to this mountain, 'Be lifted up and thrown into the sea,' if he doesn't doubt in his heart but believes that what he says will happen, it will be done for him.
41Mk 11:24 That is why I tell you, whatever you ask for in prayer, believe that you have received it and it will be yours.23
41Mk 11:25 "Whenever you stand up to pray, forgive whatever you have against anyone, so that your Father in heaven will forgive your sins.
41Mk 11:26 But if you do not forgive, your Father in heaven will not forgive your sins."25
41Mk 11:27 Then they went into Jerusalem again. While Jesus was walking in the temple, the high priests, the scribes, and the elders came to him
41Mk 11:28 and asked him, "By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority to do them?"
41Mk 11:29 Jesus said to them, "I will ask you one question. Answer me, and then I will tell you by what authority I am doing these things.
41Mk 11:30 Was John's authority to baptize from heaven or from humans? Answer me."11
41Mk 11:31 They began discussing this among themselves. "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
41Mk 11:32 But if we say, 'From humans'¡¦?" They were afraid of the crowd, because everyone really thought John was a prophet. 
41Mk 11:33 So they answered Jesus, "We don't know." Then Jesus told them, "Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things."
41Mk 12:1 Then Jesus began to speak to them in parables. "A man planted a vineyard. He put a wall around it, dug a pit for the wine press, and built a watchtower. Then he leased it to tenant farmers and went abroad.
41Mk 12:2 At the right time he sent a servant to the farmers to collect from them a share of the produce from the vineyard.
41Mk 12:3 But the farmers grabbed the servant, beat him, and sent him back empty-handed.
41Mk 12:4 Again, the man sent another servant to them. They beat the servant over the head and treated him shamefully.
41Mk 12:5 Then the man sent another, and that one they killed. So it was with many other servants. Some of these they beat, and others they killed.
41Mk 12:6 He still had one more person to send, a son whom he loved. Finally, he sent him to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.'
41Mk 12:7 But those farmers said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come on, let's kill him, and the inheritance will be ours!'
41Mk 12:8 So they grabbed him, killed him, and threw him out of the vineyard.5
41Mk 12:9 "Now what will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come, execute the farmers, and give the vineyard to others.
41Mk 12:10 Haven't you ever read this Scripture£º 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
41Mk 12:11 This was the Lord's doing, and it is amazing in our eyes'?"
41Mk 12:12 They were trying to arrest him but were afraid of the crowd. Realizing that he had spoken this parable against them, they left him alone and went away. 
41Mk 12:13 Then they sent some Pharisees and some Herodians to him, intending to trap him in what he said.
41Mk 12:14 They came and said to him, "Teacher, we know that you are sincere. You don't favor any individual, because you pay no attention to external appearance. Rather, you teach the way of God truthfully. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar or not? Should we pay them or should we not?"
41Mk 12:15 Seeing through their hypocrisy, Jesus replied to them, "Why are you testing me? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it."
41Mk 12:16 So they brought one. Then he asked them, "Whose face and name are on this?" They said to him, "Caesar's."
41Mk 12:17 So Jesus told them, "Give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's." And they were utterly amazed at him.
41Mk 12:18 Then some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus and asked him,
41Mk 12:19 "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no child, he should marry the widow and have children for his brother.
41Mk 12:20 There were seven brothers. The first one married and died without having children.
41Mk 12:21 Then the second married her and died without having children, and so did the third.
41Mk 12:22 None of the seven left any children. Last of all, the woman died, too.
41Mk 12:23 In the resurrection, whose wife will she be, since all seven had married her?"21
41Mk 12:24 Jesus answered them, "Aren't you mistaken because you don't know the Scriptures or God's power - 
41Mk 12:25 When people rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage but are like the angels in heaven.
41Mk 12:26 As for the dead being raised, haven't you read in the book of Moses, in the story about the bush, how God said, 'I am the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob' - 
41Mk 12:27 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living. You are badly mistaken!"
41Mk 12:28 Then one of the scribes came near and heard the Sadducees arguing with one another. He saw how well Jesus answered them, so he asked him, "Which commandment is the most important of them all?" 
41Mk 12:29 Jesus answered, "The most important is, 'Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God is one Lord,
41Mk 12:30 and you must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your strength.'
41Mk 12:31 The second is this£º 'You must love your neighbor as yourself.' No other commandment is greater than these." 
41Mk 12:32 Then the scribe said to him, "Well said, Teacher! You have told the truth that 'God is one, and there is no other besides him.'
41Mk 12:33 To love him with all your heart, with all your understanding, and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is more important than all the burnt offerings and sacrifices." 
41Mk 12:34 When Jesus saw how wisely the man answered, he told him, "You are not far from the kingdom of God." After that, no one dared to ask him another question.
41Mk 12:35 While Jesus was teaching in the temple, he asked, "How can the scribes say that the Messiah is David's son - 
41Mk 12:36 David himself said by the Holy Spirit, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet."'
41Mk 12:37 David himself calls him 'Lord,' so how can he be his son?" And the large crowd kept listening to him with delight.
41Mk 12:38 As he taught, he said, "Beware of the scribes! They like to walk around in long robes, to be greeted in the marketplaces,
41Mk 12:39 and to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.
41Mk 12:40 They devour widows' houses and say long prayers to cover it up. They will receive greater condemnation!" 
41Mk 12:41 As Jesus sat facing the offering box, he watched how the crowd was dropping their money into it. Many rich people were dropping in large amounts.
41Mk 12:42 Then a destitute widow came and dropped in two small copper coins, worth about a cent.
41Mk 12:43 He called his disciples and said to them, "I tell you with certainty, this destitute widow has dropped in more than everyone who is contributing to the offering box,
41Mk 12:44 because all of them contributed out of their surplus, but out of her poverty she has given everything she had to live on." 
41Mk 13:1 As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, "Look, Teacher, what large stones and what beautiful buildings!" 
41Mk 13:2 "Do you see these large buildings?" Jesus responded. "Not one stone here will be left on another that will not be torn down." 
41Mk 13:3 As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives facing the temple, Peter, James, John, and Andrew were asking him privately,
41Mk 13:4 "Tell us, when will these things happen, and what will be the sign when these things will be put into effect?" 
41Mk 13:5 Jesus began to say to them, "See to it that no one deceives you.
41Mk 13:6 Many will come in my name and say, 'I AM,' and they will deceive many people.
41Mk 13:7 But when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, stop being alarmed. These things must take place, but the end hasn't come yet,
41Mk 13:8 because nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes and famines in various places. These things are only the beginning of the birth pains." 
41Mk 13:9 "As for yourselves, be on your guard! People will hand you over to local councils, and you will be beaten in their synagogues. You will stand before governors and kings to testify to them because of me.
41Mk 13:10 But first, the gospel must be proclaimed to all nations.
41Mk 13:11 "When they take you away and hand you over for trial, don't worry ahead of time about what you will say. Instead, say whatever is given to you at that time, because it won't be you speaking, but the Holy Spirit.
41Mk 13:12 Brother will betray brother to death, and a father his child. Children will rebel against their parents and have them put to death.
41Mk 13:13 You will be hated continuously by everyone because of my name. But the person who endures to the end will be saved." 
41Mk 13:14 "So when you see the destructive desecration standing where it should not be (let the reader take note), then those who are in Judea must flee to the mountains.
41Mk 13:15 The one who is on his housetop must not come down and go into his house to take anything out of it,
41Mk 13:16 and the one who is in the field must not turn back to get his coat.
41Mk 13:17 "How terrible it will be for women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days!
41Mk 13:18 Pray that it may not be in winter,
41Mk 13:19 because those days will be a time of suffering, a kind that has not happened from the beginning of God's creation until now, and certainly will never happen again.
41Mk 13:20 If the Lord had not shortened those days, no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect whom he has chosen, he has shortened those days.17
41Mk 13:21 "At that time, if anyone says to you, 'Look! Here is the Messiah!', or, 'Look! There he is!', don't believe it,
41Mk 13:22 because false messiahs and false prophets will appear and produce signs and omens to deceive, if possible, the elect.
41Mk 13:23 So be on your guard! I've told you everything before it happens." 
41Mk 13:24 "But after the suffering of those days, 'The sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light,
41Mk 13:25 the stars will fall from the sky, and the powers of heaven will be shaken loose.'
41Mk 13:26 Then people will see 'the Son of Man coming in clouds' with great power and glory.
41Mk 13:27 He will send out his angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven."
41Mk 13:28 "Now learn a lesson from the fig tree. When its branches become tender and it produces leaves, you know that summer is near.
41Mk 13:29 In the same way, when you see these things taking place, you will know that the Son of Man is near, right at the door.
41Mk 13:30 I tell you with certainty, this generation will not disappear until all these things take place.
41Mk 13:31 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear."13
41Mk 13:32 "No one knows when that day or hour will come - not the angels in heaven, not the Son, but only the Father.
41Mk 13:33 Be careful! Watch out! Because you don't know when the time will come.
41Mk 13:34 It's like a man who went on a trip. As he left home, he put his servants in charge, each with his own work, and he ordered the doorkeeper to be alert.
41Mk 13:35 So keep on watching, because you don't know when the master of the house is coming - whether in the evening, at three o'clock in the morning, or at dawn.
41Mk 13:36 Otherwise, he may come suddenly and find you asleep.
41Mk 13:37 I'm telling you what I'm telling everyone£º Be alert!"
41Mk 14:1 Now it was two days before the Passover and the Festival of Unleavened Bread. The high priests and the scribes were looking for a way to arrest Jesus secretly and to have him put to death,
41Mk 14:2 because they kept saying, "This must not happen during the festival. Otherwise, there'll be a riot among the people."
41Mk 14:3 While Jesus was in Bethany sitting at the table in the home of Simon the leper, a woman arrived with an alabaster jar of very expensive perfume made from pure nard. She broke open the jar and poured the perfume on his head.
41Mk 14:4 Irritated, some who were there asked one another, "Why was the perfume wasted like this - 
41Mk 14:5 This perfume could have been sold for more than30 0 denarii and the money given to the destitute." So they got extremely angry with her.4
41Mk 14:6 But Jesus said, "Leave her alone. Why are you bothering her? She has done a beautiful thing for me,
41Mk 14:7 because you will always have the destitute with you and can help them whenever you want, but you will not always have me.
41Mk 14:8 She has done what she could. She poured perfume on my body in preparation for my burial.
41Mk 14:9 I tell you with certainty, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told as a memorial to her."
41Mk 14:10 Then Judas Iscariot, one of the twelve disciples, went to the high priests to betray Jesus to them.
41Mk 14:11 After they had listened to him, they were delighted and promised to give him money. So he began to look for a good opportunity to betray him.
41Mk 14:12 On the first day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread, when the Passover lamb is sacrificed, Jesus' disciples asked him, "Where do you want us to go and make preparations for you to eat the Passover meal?" 
41Mk 14:13 He sent two of his disciples, telling them, "Go into the city, and you will meet a man carrying a jug of water. Follow him.
41Mk 14:14 When he goes into a house, say to its owner that the Teacher asks, 'Where is my room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?'
41Mk 14:15 Then he will show you a large upstairs room that is furnished and ready. Get everything ready for us there."
41Mk 14:16 So the disciples left and went into the city. They found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
41Mk 14:17 When evening came, Jesus arrived with his twelve disciples.
41Mk 14:18 While they were at the table eating, Jesus said, "I tell you with certainty, one of you is going to betray me, one who is eating with me."
41Mk 14:19 They began to be very sad and asked him, one after the other, "Surely I am not the one, am I?"
41Mk 14:20 He said to them, "It's one of you twelve men, the one who is dipping his bread into the bowl with me.
41Mk 14:21 For the Son of Man is going away, just as it has been written about him, but how terrible it will be for that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for him if he had never been born." 
41Mk 14:22 While they were eating, Jesus took a loaf of bread and blessed it. Then he broke it in pieces and handed it to them, saying, "Take some. This is my body."
41Mk 14:23 Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and gave it to them, and they all drank from it.
41Mk 14:24 He said to them, "This is my blood of the covenant that is being poured out for many people.
41Mk 14:25 I tell you with certainty, I will never again drink this wine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God."
41Mk 14:26 After singing a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. 
41Mk 14:27 Then Jesus said to them, "All of you will turn against me, because it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.'
41Mk 14:28 However, after I have been raised, I will go to Galilee ahead of you." 
41Mk 14:29 But Peter said to him, "Even if everyone else turns against you, I certainly won't." 
41Mk 14:30 Jesus said to him, "I tell you with certainty, today, this very night, before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times."
41Mk 14:31 But Peter kept saying emphatically, "Even if I have to die with you, I will never deny you!" And all the others kept saying the same thing.
41Mk 14:32 Then they came to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, "Sit down here while I pray."
41Mk 14:33 He took Peter, James, and John along with him, and he began to feel distressed and troubled.
41Mk 14:34 So he said to them, "I am deeply grieved, even to the point of death. Wait here and stay awake." 
41Mk 14:35 Going on a little farther, he fell to the ground and kept praying that if it were possible the hour might pass from him.
41Mk 14:36 He kept repeating, "Abba! Father! All things are possible for you. Take this cup away from me. Yet not what I want but what you want." 
41Mk 14:37 When he went back, he found his disciples asleep. "Simon, are you asleep?" he asked Peter. "You couldn't stay awake for one hour, could you - 
41Mk 14:38 All of you must stay awake and pray that you won't be tempted. The spirit is indeed willing, but the flesh is weak." 
41Mk 14:39 He went away again and prayed the same prayer as before.
41Mk 14:40 Again he came back and found them asleep, because they could not keep their eyes open. They didn't even know what they should say to him.
41Mk 14:41 He came back a third time. "Are you still sleeping and resting?" he asked. "Enough of that! The time has come. Look! The Son of Man is being betrayed into the hands of sinners.
41Mk 14:42 Get up! Let's go! See, the one who is betraying me is near!" 
41Mk 14:43 Just then, while Jesus was still speaking, Judas, one of the twelve disciples, arrived. A crowd armed with swords and clubs was with him. They were from the high priests, the scribes, and the elders.
41Mk 14:44 Now the betrayer personally had given them a signal, saying, "The one I kiss is the man. Arrest him, and lead him safely away."
41Mk 14:45 So Judas immediately went up to Jesus and said, "Rabbi,", and kissed him tenderly.44
41Mk 14:46 Then the men took hold of Jesus and arrested him.
41Mk 14:47 But one of those standing there drew his sword and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his ear.
41Mk 14:48 Jesus asked them, "Have you come out with swords and clubs to arrest me as if I were a bandit - 
41Mk 14:49 Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, yet you didn't arrest me. But the Scriptures must be fulfilled."
41Mk 14:50 Then all the disciples deserted Jesus and ran away. 
41Mk 14:51 A certain young man, who was wearing nothing but a linen sheet, was following Jesus. When the men grabbed him,
41Mk 14:52 he left the linen sheet behind and ran away naked.
41Mk 14:53 Then they took Jesus to the high priest. All the high priests, elders, and scribes had gathered together.
41Mk 14:54 Peter followed Jesus at a distance as far as the high priest's courtyard. He was sitting with the servants and warming himself at the fire.
41Mk 14:55 Meanwhile, the high priests and the whole Council were looking for some testimony against Jesus in order to have him put to death, but they couldn't find any.
41Mk 14:56 Although many people gave false testimony against him, their testimony didn't agree.
41Mk 14:57 Then some men stood up and gave false testimony against him, saying,
41Mk 14:58 "We ourselves heard him say, 'I will destroy this sanctuary made by human hands, and in three days I will build another one not made by human hands.'"
41Mk 14:59 But even on this point their testimony didn't agree.58
41Mk 14:60 Then the high priest stood up before them and asked Jesus, "Don't you have any answer to what these men are testifying against you?"
41Mk 14:61 But he kept silent and didn't answer at all. The high priest asked him again, "Are you the Messiah, the Son of the Blessed One?" 
41Mk 14:62 Jesus said, "I AM, and 'you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Power' and 'coming with the clouds of heaven.'"
41Mk 14:63 Then the high priest tore his clothes. "Why do we still need witnesses?" he asked.
41Mk 14:64 "You have heard his blasphemy! What is your verdict?" All of them condemned him as deserving death.
41Mk 14:65 Some of them began to spit on him. They blindfolded him and kept hitting him with their fists and telling him, "Prophesy!" Even the servants took him and slapped him around.
41Mk 14:66 While Peter was down in the courtyard, one of the high priest's servant girls came by.
41Mk 14:67 When she saw Peter warming himself, she glared at him and said, "You, too, were with Jesus from Nazareth."
41Mk 14:68 But he denied it, saying, "I don't know - or even understand - what you're talking about!" Then he went out into the entryway. Just then a rooster crowed.
41Mk 14:69 The servant girl saw him and again said to those who were standing around, "This man is one of them!"
41Mk 14:70 Again he denied it. After a little while the people who were standing there began to say to Peter again, "Obviously you're one of them, because you are a Galilean!" 
41Mk 14:71 Then he began to invoke a divine curse and to swear with an oath, "I don't know this man you're talking about!"
41Mk 14:72 Just then a rooster crowed a second time. Peter remembered that Jesus said to him, "Before a rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times." Then he broke down and cried. 
41Mk 15:1 As soon as it was morning, the high priests convened a meeting with the elders and scribes and the whole Council. They bound Jesus with chains, led him away, and handed him over to Pilate.
41Mk 15:2 Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" Jesus answered him, "You say so." 
41Mk 15:3 The high priests kept accusing him of many things.
41Mk 15:4 So Pilate asked him again, "Don't you have any answer? Look how many accusations they're bringing against you!"
41Mk 15:5 But since Jesus no longer answered, Pilate was astonished. 
41Mk 15:6 At every festival Pilate would release any one prisoner whom the people requested.
41Mk 15:7 Now there was a man in prison named Barabbas. He had been with the insurgents who had committed murder during the rebellion.
41Mk 15:8 So the crowd came and began to request that Pilate do for them what he always did.
41Mk 15:9 Pilate answered them, "Do you want me to release the king of the Jews for you?"
41Mk 15:10 because he knew that the high priests had handed him over due to jealousy.8
41Mk 15:11 But the high priests stirred up the crowd to get him to release Barabbas for them instead.
41Mk 15:12 So Pilate asked them again, "Then what should I do with the man you call 'the King of the Jews'?"
41Mk 15:13 They shouted back, "Crucify him!"
41Mk 15:14 Pilate asked them, "Why? What has he done wrong?"But they shouted even louder, "Crucify him!"
41Mk 15:15 So Pilate, wanting to satisfy the crowd, released Barabbas for them, but he had Jesus whipped and handed over to be crucified. 
41Mk 15:16 The soldiers led Jesus into the courtyard of the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters) and called out the whole guard.
41Mk 15:17 They dressed him in a purple robe, twisted some thorns into a victor's crown, and placed it on his head.
41Mk 15:18 They began to greet him, "Long live the king of the Jews!"
41Mk 15:19 They kept hitting him on the head with a stick, spitting on him, kneeling in front of him, and worshiping him.
41Mk 15:20 When they had finished making fun of him, they stripped him of the purple robe, put his own clothes back on him, and led him away to crucify him.
41Mk 15:21 They forced a certain passer-by named Simon of Cyrene, the father of Alexander and Rufus, who happened to be coming in from the country, to carry Jesus' cross.
41Mk 15:22 They took Jesus to a place called Golgotha, which means Skull Place.
41Mk 15:23 They tried to give him wine mixed with myrrh, but he wouldn't accept it. 
41Mk 15:24 Then they crucified him. They divided his clothes among themselves by throwing dice to see what each one would get.
41Mk 15:25 It was nine in the morning when they crucified him.
41Mk 15:26 The written notice of the charge against him read, "The king of the Jews."
41Mk 15:27 They crucified two bandits with him, one on his right and the other on his left.
41Mk 15:28 ...
41Mk 15:29 Those who passed by kept insulting him, shaking their heads, and saying, "Ha! You who were going to destroy the sanctuary and rebuild it in three days - 
41Mk 15:30 save yourself and come down from the cross!"
41Mk 15:31 In the same way the high priests, along with the scribes, were also making fun of him among themselves. They kept saying, "He saved others but can't save himself!
41Mk 15:32 Let the Messiah, the king of Israel, come down from the cross now, since seeing is believing!" Even the men who were crucified with him kept insulting him. 
41Mk 15:33 At noon, darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon.
41Mk 15:34 At three o'clock Jesus cried out with a loud voice, "Eloi, eloi, lema sabachthani?", which means, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
41Mk 15:35 When some of the people standing there heard this, they said, "Listen! He's calling for Elijah!"
41Mk 15:36 So someone ran and soaked a sponge in some sour wine. Then he put it on a stick and offered Jesus a drink, saying, "Wait! Let's see if Elijah comes to take him down!" 
41Mk 15:37 Then Jesus gave a loud cry and breathed his last.
41Mk 15:38 The curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two from top to bottom.
41Mk 15:39 When the centurion who stood facing Jesus saw how he had cried out and breathed his last, he said, "This man certainly was the Son of God!"
41Mk 15:40 Now there were women watching from a distance. Among them were Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of young James and Joseph, and Salome.
41Mk 15:41 They used to accompany him and care for him while he was in Galilee. Many other women who had come up to Jerusalem with him were there, too. 
41Mk 15:42 It was the Day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath. Since it was already evening,
41Mk 15:43 Joseph of Arimathea, a highly respected member of the Council, who was waiting for the kingdom of God, went boldly to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
41Mk 15:44 Pilate was amazed to hear that Jesus had already died, so he summoned the centurion to ask him if he was in fact dead.
41Mk 15:45 When he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he let Joseph have the corpse.
41Mk 15:46 Joseph bought some linen cloth, took the body down, wrapped it in the cloth, laid it in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock, and rolled a stone against the door of the tomb.
41Mk 15:47 Now Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joseph observed where the body had been laid.
41Mk 16:1 When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices to go and anoint Jesus.
41Mk 16:2 Very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had just come up, they were going to the tomb.
41Mk 16:3 They kept saying to one another, "Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance to the tomb?"
41Mk 16:4 Then they looked up and saw that the stone had been rolled away. (It was a very large stone.)
41Mk 16:5 As they went into the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were utterly astonished.
41Mk 16:6 But he said to them, "Stop being astonished! You are looking for Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has been raised. He is not here. Look at the place where they laid him.
41Mk 16:7 But go and tell his disciples, especially Peter, that Jesus is going ahead of you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you." 
41Mk 16:8 So they left the tomb and ran away, overwhelmed by shock and astonishment. They didn't say a thing to anyone, because they were afraid.
41Mk 16:9 After Jesus had risen early on the first day of that week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had driven out seven demons.
41Mk 16:10 She went and told those who had been with Jesus and who now were grieving and crying.
41Mk 16:11 When they heard that he was alive and that he had been seen by her, they refused to believe Mary. 
41Mk 16:12 After this, Jesus appeared in a different form to two disciples as they were walking into the country.
41Mk 16:13 They went back and told the others, who didn't believe them, either.
41Mk 16:14 Finally he appeared to his eleven disciples while they were eating. He rebuked them for their unbelief and stubbornness, because they had not believed those who had seen him after he had risen.
41Mk 16:15 Then he said to them, "As you go into all the world, proclaim the gospel to everyone.
41Mk 16:16 Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever doesn't believe will be condemned.
41Mk 16:17 "These are the signs that will accompany those who believe£º In my name they will drive out demons; they will speak in new tongues;
41Mk 16:18 they will pick up snakes with their hands; even if they drink any deadly poison it will not hurt them; and they will place their hands on the sick, and they will recover." 
41Mk 16:19 So the Lord Jesus, after talking with his disciples, was taken up to heaven and sat down at the right hand of God.
41Mk 16:20 Then his disciples went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord kept working with them and confirming the message by the signs that accompanied it.
42
42Lk 1:1 Since many people have attempted to write an orderly account of the events that have transpired among us,
42Lk 1:2 just as they were passed down to us by those who had been eyewitnesses and servants of the word from the beginning,
42Lk 1:3 I, too, have carefully investigated everything from the beginning and have decided to write an orderly account for you, most excellent Theophilus,
42Lk 1:4 so that you may know the certainty of the things you have been taught. 
42Lk 1:5 In the days of King Herod of Judea, there was a priest named Zechariah, who belonged to the priestly order of Abijah. His wife was a descendant of Aaron, and her name was Elizabeth.
42Lk 1:6 Both of them were righteous before God, having lived blamelessly according to all of the commandments and regulations of the Lord.
42Lk 1:7 They had no children because Elizabeth was barren and because both of them were getting old.
42Lk 1:8 When Zechariah was serving with his division of priests in God's presence,
42Lk 1:9 he was chosen by lot to go into the sanctuary of the Lord and burn incense, according to the custom of the priests.
42Lk 1:10 And the entire congregation of people was praying outside at the time when the incense was burned. 
42Lk 1:11 An angel of the Lord appeared to him, standing at the right side of the incense altar.
42Lk 1:12 When Zechariah saw him, he was startled, and fear overwhelmed him.
42Lk 1:13 But the angel said to him, "Stop being afraid, Zechariah, because your prayer has been heard. Your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you are to name him John.
42Lk 1:14 You will have great joy, and many people will rejoice at his birth,
42Lk 1:15 because he will be great in the Lord's presence. He will never drink wine or any strong drink, and he will be filled with the Holy Spirit even before he is born.
42Lk 1:16 He will bring many of Israel's descendants back to the Lord their God.
42Lk 1:17 He is the one who will go before the Lord with the spirit and power of Elijah to turn the hearts of parents to their children and the disobedient to the wisdom of the righteous, and to prepare the people to be ready for the Lord." 
42Lk 1:18 Then Zechariah asked the angel, "How can I be sure of this, since I am an old man, and my wife is getting older?"
42Lk 1:19 The angel answered him, "I am Gabriel! I stand in the very presence of God. I have been sent to speak to you and to announce this good news to you.
42Lk 1:20 But because you did not believe my announcement, which will be fulfilled at its proper time, you will become silent and unable to speak until the day this happens." 
42Lk 1:21 Meanwhile, the people kept waiting for Zechariah and wondering why he stayed in the sanctuary so long.
42Lk 1:22 But when he did come out, he was unable to speak to them. Then they realized that he had seen a vision in the sanctuary. He kept motioning to them but remained unable to speak.
42Lk 1:23 When the days of his service were over, he went home. 
42Lk 1:24 After this, his wife Elizabeth became pregnant and remained in seclusion for five months. She said,
42Lk 1:25 "This is what the Lord did for me when he looked favorably on me and took away my public disgrace." 
42Lk 1:26 Now in the sixth month of her pregnancy, the angel Gabriel was sent by God to a city in Galilee called Nazareth,
42Lk 1:27 to a virgin engaged to a man named Joseph, a descendant of David. The virgin's name was Mary.
42Lk 1:28 The angel came to her and said, "Greetings, you who are highly favored! The Lord is with you!"
42Lk 1:29 Startled by his statement, she tried to figure out what his greeting meant.
42Lk 1:30 Then the angel told her, "Stop being afraid, Mary, because you have found favor with God.
42Lk 1:31 Listen! You will become pregnant and give birth to a son, and you are to name him Jesus.
42Lk 1:32 He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his ancestor David.
42Lk 1:33 He will rule over the house of Jacob forever, and his kingdom will never end." 
42Lk 1:34 Mary asked the angel, "How can this happen, since I have not had relations with a man?"
42Lk 1:35 The angel answered her, "The Holy Spirit will come over you, and the power of the Most High will surround you. Therefore, the child will be holy and will be called the Son of God.
42Lk 1:36 And listen! Elizabeth, your relative, has herself conceived a son in her old age, this woman who was said to be barren is in her sixth month.
42Lk 1:37 Nothing is impossible with respect to any of God's promises." 
42Lk 1:38 Then Mary said, "Truly I am the Lord's servant. Let everything you have said happen to me." Then the angel left her.
42Lk 1:39 Later on, Mary set out for a Judean city in the hill country.
42Lk 1:40 She went into Zechariah's home and greeted Elizabeth.
42Lk 1:41 When Elizabeth heard Mary's greeting, the baby jumped in her womb. Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit
42Lk 1:42 and she loudly exclaimed, "How blessed are you among women, and how blessed is the infant in your womb!
42Lk 1:43 Why should this happen to me, to have the mother of my Lord visit me - 
42Lk 1:44 As soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb jumped for joy.
42Lk 1:45 How blessed is this woman for believing that what was spoken to her by the Lord would be fulfilled!"
42Lk 1:46 Then Mary said, "My soul praises the greatness of the Lord!
42Lk 1:47 My spirit exults in God, my Savior,
42Lk 1:48 because he has looked favorably on his humble servant. From now on, all generations will call me blessed,
42Lk 1:49 because the Almighty has done great things for me. His name is holy.
42Lk 1:50 His mercy lasts from generation to generation for those who fear him.
42Lk 1:51 He displayed his mighty power with his arm. He scattered people who were proud in mind and heart.
42Lk 1:52 He pulled powerful rulers from their thrones and lifted up humble people.
42Lk 1:53 He filled hungry people with good things and sent rich people away with nothing.
42Lk 1:54 He helped his servant Israel, remembering to be merciful,
42Lk 1:55 according to the promise he made to our ancestors? to Abraham and his descendants forever."
42Lk 1:56 Now Mary stayed with Elizabeth about three months and then went back home.
42Lk 1:57 When the time came for Elizabeth to have her child, she gave birth to a son.
42Lk 1:58 Her neighbors and relatives heard that the Lord had shown his great mercy to her, and they rejoiced with her. 
42Lk 1:59 On the eighth day they went to circumcise the child. They were going to name him Zechariah after his father,
42Lk 1:60 but his mother said, "Absolutely not! He must be named John." 
42Lk 1:61 Their friends said to her, "None of your relatives has that name."
42Lk 1:62 So they motioned to the baby's father to see what he wanted to name him.
42Lk 1:63 He asked for a writing tablet and wrote, "His name is John." And everyone was amazed. 
42Lk 1:64 Suddenly, Zechariah could open his mouth, his tongue was set free, and he began to speak and to praise God.
42Lk 1:65 Fear came over all their neighbors, and throughout the hill country of Judea all these things were being discussed.
42Lk 1:66 Everyone who heard about it kept thinking what had happened and asked, "What will this child become?" because it was obvious that the hand of the Lord was with him.164
42Lk 1:67 Then his father Zechariah was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied£º 
42Lk 1:68 "Blessed be the Lord God of Israel! He has taken care of his people and has set them free.
42Lk 1:69 He has raised up a mighty Savior for us from the family of his servant David,
42Lk 1:70 just as he promised long ago through the mouth of his holy prophets
42Lk 1:71 that he would save us from our enemies and from the grip of all who hate us.
42Lk 1:72 He has shown mercy to our ancestors and remembered his holy covenant,
42Lk 1:73 the oath that he swore to our ancestor Abraham. He granted us
42Lk 1:74 deliverance from our enemies' grip so that we could serve him without fear
42Lk 1:75 and be holy and righteous before him all of our days. 
42Lk 1:76 And you, child, will be called a prophet of the Most High, because you will go ahead of the Lord to prepare his way
42Lk 1:77 and to give his people knowledge of salvation through forgiveness of their sins.
42Lk 1:78 Because of the tender mercy of our God, his light from on high has visited us,
42Lk 1:79 to shine on those who sit in darkness and in death's shadow, and to guide our feet into the way of peace."
42Lk 1:80 Now the child continued to grow and to become spiritually strong. He lived in the wilderness until the day he appeared in Israel. 
42Lk 2:1 Now in those days an order was published by Caesar Augustus that the whole world should be registered.
42Lk 2:2 This was the first registration taken while Quirinius was governor of Syria.
42Lk 2:3 So all the people went to their hometowns to be registered.2
42Lk 2:4 Joseph, too, went up from the city of Nazareth in Galilee to Judea, to the city of David called Bethlehem, because he was a descendant of the household and family of David.
42Lk 2:5 He went there to be registered with Mary, who had been promised to him in marriage and was pregnant.4
42Lk 2:6 While they were there, the time came for her to have her baby,
42Lk 2:7 and she gave birth to her first child, a son. She wrapped him in strips of cloth and laid him in a feeding trough, because there was no place for them in the guest quarters.
42Lk 2:8 In that region there were shepherds living in the fields, watching their flock during the night.
42Lk 2:9 An angel of the Lord appeared to them, and the glory of the Lord shone around them, and they were terrified.
42Lk 2:10 Then the angel said to them, "Stop being afraid! Listen! I am bringing you good news of great joy for all the people.
42Lk 2:11 Today your Savior, the Lord Messiah, was born in the city of David.
42Lk 2:12 And this will be a sign for you£º You will find a baby wrapped in strips of cloth and lying in a feeding trough."
42Lk 2:13 Suddenly a multitude of the Heavenly Army appeared with the angel, praising God by saying,
42Lk 2:14 "Glory to God in the highest, and peace on earth to people who enjoy his favor!"
42Lk 2:15 When the angels had left them and gone back to heaven, the shepherds said to one another, "Let's go to Bethlehem and see what has taken place that the Lord has told us about."
42Lk 2:16 So they went quickly and found Mary and Joseph with the baby, who was lying in the feeding trough.
42Lk 2:17 When they saw this, they repeated what they had been told about this child.
42Lk 2:18 All who heard it were amazed at what the shepherds told them.
42Lk 2:19 However, Mary continued to treasure all these things in her heart and to ponder them.
42Lk 2:20 Then the shepherds returned to their flock, glorifying and praising God for everything they had heard and seen, just as it had been told to them.
42Lk 2:21 After eight days had passed, the infant was circumcised and named Jesus, the name given him by the angel before he was conceived in the womb. 
42Lk 2:22 When the time came for their purification according to the law of Moses, Joseph and Mary took Jesus up to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord,
42Lk 2:23 as it is written in the law of the Lord, "Every firstborn son is to be designated as holy to the Lord."
42Lk 2:24 They also offered a sacrifice according to what is specified in the law of the Lord£º "a pair of turtledoves or two young pigeons."
42Lk 2:25 Now a man named Simeon was in Jerusalem. This man was righteous and devout. He was waiting for the one who would comfort Israel, and the Holy Spirit was upon him.
42Lk 2:26 It had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that he would not die until he had seen the Lord's Messiah.25
42Lk 2:27 Led by the Spirit, he went into the temple. When the parents brought the child Jesus to do for him what was customary under the law,
42Lk 2:28 Simeon took the infant in his arms and praised God, saying,
42Lk 2:29 "Master, now you are dismissing your servant in peace according to your promise.
42Lk 2:30 Because my eyes have seen your salvation, 
42Lk 2:31 which you prepared for all people to see - 
42Lk 2:32 a light that will reveal salvation to the gentiles and bring glory to your people Israel."
42Lk 2:33 Jesus' father and mother kept wondering at the things being said about him.
42Lk 2:34 Then Simeon blessed them and said to Mary, his mother, "This infant is destined to cause many in Israel to fall and rise. Also, he will be a sign that will be opposed.
42Lk 2:35 Indeed, a sword will pierce your own soul, too, so that the inner thoughts of many people might be revealed."
42Lk 2:36 Now Anna, a prophetess, was also there. She was a descendant of Phanuel from the tribe of Asher. She was very old, having lived with her husband for seven years after her marriage,
42Lk 2:37 and then as a widow for 84 years. She never left the temple, but continued to worship there night and day with times of fasting and prayer.
42Lk 2:38 Just then she came forward and began to thank God and to speak about Jesus to everyone who was waiting for the redemption of Jerusalem. 
42Lk 2:39 After doing everything required by the law of the Lord, Joseph and Mary returned to their hometown of Nazareth in Galilee.
42Lk 2:40 Meanwhile, the child continued to grow and to become strong. He was filled with wisdom, and God's favor rested upon him. 
42Lk 2:41 Every year Jesus' parents would go to Jerusalem for the Passover Festival.
42Lk 2:42 When Jesus was twelve years old, they went up to the festival as usual.
42Lk 2:43 When the days of the festival were over, they left for home. The young man Jesus stayed behind in Jerusalem, but his parents did not know it.
42Lk 2:44 They thought that he was in their group of travelers. After traveling for a day, they started looking for him among their relatives and friends.
42Lk 2:45 When they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem, searching desperately for him.
42Lk 2:46 Three days later they found him in the temple sitting among the teachers, listening to them, and posing questions to them.
42Lk 2:47 All who heard him were amazed at his intelligence and his answers.
42Lk 2:48 When Jesus' parents saw him, they were shocked. His mother asked him, "Son, why have you treated us like this? Your father and I have been worried sick looking for you!"
42Lk 2:49 He asked them, "Why were you looking for me? Didn't you know that I had to be in my Father's house?"
42Lk 2:50 But they did not understand what he said to them.
42Lk 2:51 Then he went back with them, returning to Nazareth and remaining in submission to them. His mother continued to treasure all these things in her heart.
42Lk 2:52 Meanwhile, Jesus kept on growing wiser and more mature, and in favor with God and his fellow man. 
42Lk 3:1 Now in the fifteenth year of the reign of Caesar Tiberius, when Pontius Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of the region of Ituraea and Trachonitis, Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene,
42Lk 3:2 and Annas and Caiaphas high priests, the word of God came to John, the son of Zechariah, in the wilderness.
42Lk 3:3 John went throughout the entire Jordan region, proclaiming a baptism about repentance for the forgiveness of sins,
42Lk 3:4 as it is written in the book of the words of the prophet Isaiah, "He is a voice calling out in the wilderness£º'Prepare the way for the Lord! Make his paths straight!
42Lk 3:5 Every valley will be filled, and every mountain and hill will be leveled. The crooked ways will be made straight, and the rough roads will be made smooth.
42Lk 3:6 Everyone will see the salvation that God has provided.'"
42Lk 3:7 John would say to the crowds that were coming out to be baptized by him, "You children of serpents! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath - 
42Lk 3:8 Produce fruit that is consistent with repentance! Don't begin to say to yourselves, 'We have father Abraham!' because I tell you that God can raise up descendants for Abraham from these stones!
42Lk 3:9 The ax already lies against the roots of the trees. So every tree not producing good fruit will be cut down and thrown into a fire." 
42Lk 3:10 The crowds kept asking him, "What, then, should we do?" 
42Lk 3:11 He answered them, "The person who has two coats must share with the one who doesn't have any, and the person who has food must do the same." 
42Lk 3:12 Even some tax collectors came to be baptized. They asked him, "Teacher, what should we do?" 
42Lk 3:13 He told them, "Stop collecting more money than the amount you are told to collect." 
42Lk 3:14 Even some soldiers were asking him, "And what should we do?"He told them, "Never extort money from anyone by threats or blackmail, and be satisfied with your pay." 
42Lk 3:15 Now the people were filled with expectation, and all of them were wondering if John was perhaps the Messiah.
42Lk 3:16 John replied to all of them, "I am baptizing you with water, but one is coming who is more powerful than I, and I'm not worthy to untie his sandal straps. It is he who will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
42Lk 3:17 His winnowing fork is in his hand to clean up his threshing floor. He will gather the grain into his barn, but he will burn the chaff with inextinguishable fire." 
42Lk 3:18 With many other exhortations John continued to proclaim the good news to the people.
42Lk 3:19 Now Herod the tetrarch had been rebuked by John because he had married his brother's wife Herodias and because of all of the other evil things Herod had done.
42Lk 3:20 Added to all this, Herod locked John up in prison.
42Lk 3:21 When all the people had been baptized, Jesus, too, was baptized. While he was praying, heaven opened,
42Lk 3:22 and the Holy Spirit descended on him, appearing in the form of a dove. Then a voice came from heaven, saying, "You are my Son, whom I love. I am pleased with you!"
42Lk 3:23 Jesus himself was about 30 years old when he began his ministry. He was (so it was thought) the son of Joseph, the son of Heli,
42Lk 3:24 the son of Matthat, the son of Levi, the son of Melchi, the son of Jannai, the son of Joseph,
42Lk 3:25 the son of Mattathias, the son of Amos, the son of Nahum, the son of Esli, the son of Naggai,
42Lk 3:26 the son of Maath, the son of Mattathias, the son of Semein, the son of Josech, the son of Joda,
42Lk 3:27 the son of Joanan, the son of Rhesa, the son of Zerubbabel, the son of Shealtiel, the son of Neri,
42Lk 3:28 the son of Melchi, the son of Addi, the son of Cosam, the son of Elmadam, the son of Er,
42Lk 3:29 the son of Joshua, the son of Eliezer, the son of Jorim, the son of Matthat, the son of Levi,
42Lk 3:30 the son of Simeon, the son of Judah, the son of Joseph, the son of Jonam, the son of Eliakim,
42Lk 3:31 the son of Melea, the son of Menna, the son of Matattha, the son of Nathan, the son of David,
42Lk 3:32 the son of Jesse, the son of Obed, the son of Boaz, the son of Salmon, the son of Nahshon,
42Lk 3:33 the son of Amminadab, the son of Admin, the son of Arni, the son of Hezron, the son of Perez, the son of Judah,
42Lk 3:34 the son of Jacob, the son of Isaac, the son of Abraham, the son of Terah, the son of Nahor,
42Lk 3:35 the son of Serug, the son of Reu, the son of Peleg, the son of Eber, the son of Shelah,
42Lk 3:36 the son of Cainan, the son of Arphaxad, the son of Shem, the son of Noah, the son of Lamech,
42Lk 3:37 the son of Methuselah, the son of Enoch, the son of Jared, the son of Mahalaleel, the son of Cainan,
42Lk 3:38 the son of Enos, the son of Seth, the son of Adam, the son of God. 
42Lk 4:1 Then Jesus, filled with the Holy Spirit, returned from the Jordan River. He was led by the Spirit into the wilderness,
42Lk 4:2 where he was being tempted by the devil for40 days. During that time he ate nothing at all, and when they were over he became hungry. 
42Lk 4:3 The devil said to him, "Since you are the Son of God, tell this stone to become a loaf of bread."
42Lk 4:4 Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'One must not live on bread alone, but on every word of God.'"
42Lk 4:5 The devil also took him to a high place and showed him all the kingdoms of the world in an instant.
42Lk 4:6 He said to Jesus, "I will give you all this authority, along with their glory, because it has been given to me, and I give it to anyone I please.
42Lk 4:7 So if you will worship me, all this will be yours."6
42Lk 4:8 But Jesus answered him, "It is written, 'You must worship the Lord your God and serve only him.'"
42Lk 4:9 The devil also took him into Jerusalem and had him stand on the highest point of the temple. He said to Jesus, "Since you are the Son of God, throw yourself down from here,
42Lk 4:10 because it is written, 'God will put his angels in charge of you to watch over you carefully.
42Lk 4:11 With their hands they will hold you up, so that you will never hit your foot against a rock.'"
42Lk 4:12 Jesus answered him, "It has been said, 'You must not tempt the Lord your God.'"
42Lk 4:13 After the devil had finished tempting Jesus in every possible way, he left him until another time. 
42Lk 4:14 Then Jesus returned to Galilee by the power of the Spirit. Meanwhile, the news about him spread throughout the surrounding country.
42Lk 4:15 He began to teach in their synagogues and was continuously receiving praise from everyone.
42Lk 4:16 Then Jesus came to Nazareth, where he had been raised. As was his custom, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day. When he stood up to read,
42Lk 4:17 the scroll of the prophet Isaiah was handed to him. Unrolling the scroll, he found the place where it was written,
42Lk 4:18 "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me; he has anointed me to tell the good news to the poor. He has sent me to announce release to the prisoners and recovery of sight to the blind, to set oppressed people free,
42Lk 4:19 and to announce the year of the Lord's favor."
42Lk 4:20 Then he rolled up the scroll, gave it back to the attendant, and sat down. While the eyes of everyone in the synagogue were fixed on him,
42Lk 4:21 he began to say to them, "Today this Scripture has been fulfilled, as you've heard it read aloud."
42Lk 4:22 All the people began to speak well of him and to wonder at the gracious words that flowed from his mouth. They said, "This is Joseph's son, isn't it?" 
42Lk 4:23 So he said to them, "You will probably quote this proverb to me, 'Doctor, heal yourself! Do everything here in your hometown that we hear you did in Capernaum.'"
42Lk 4:24 He added, "I tell all of you with certainty, a prophet is not accepted in his hometown.
42Lk 4:25 I'm telling you the truth - there were many widows in Israel in Elijah's time, when it didn't rain for three years and six months and there was a severe famine everywhere in the land.
42Lk 4:26 Yet Elijah wasn't sent to a single one of those widows except to one at Zarephath in Sidon.
42Lk 4:27 There were also many lepers in Israel in the prophet Elisha's time, yet not one of them was cleansed except Naaman the Syrian." 
42Lk 4:28 All the people in the synagogue became furious when they heard this.
42Lk 4:29 They got up, forced Jesus out of the city, and led him to the edge of the hill on which their city was built, intending to throw him off.
42Lk 4:30 But he walked right through the middle of them and went away.29
42Lk 4:31 Then Jesus went down to Capernaum, a city in Galilee, and began teaching the people on Sabbath days.
42Lk 4:32 They were utterly amazed at what he taught, because his message was spoken with authority. 
42Lk 4:33 In the synagogue was a man who had a demon. He screamed with a loud voice,
42Lk 4:34 "Oh, no! What do you want with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are - the Holy One of God!" 
42Lk 4:35 But Jesus rebuked him, saying, "Be quiet, and come out of him!" At this, the demon threw the man down in the middle of the synagogue and came out of him without hurting him.
42Lk 4:36 Overwhelmed with amazement, they all kept saying to one another, "What kind of statement is this -  - because with authority and power he gives orders to unclean spirits, and they come out!"
42Lk 4:37 So news about him spread to every place in the surrounding region.
42Lk 4:38 Then Jesus got up to leave the synagogue and went into Simon's house. Now Simon's mother-in-law was sick with a high fever, so they asked Jesus about her.
42Lk 4:39 He bent over her, rebuked the fever, and it left her. She got up at once and began serving them.
42Lk 4:40 When the sun was setting, everyone who had any friends suffering from various diseases brought them to him. He placed his hands on each of them and began healing them.
42Lk 4:41 Even demons came out of many people, screaming, "You are the Son of God!" But Jesus rebuked them and ordered them not to speak, because they knew he was the Messiah.
42Lk 4:42 At daybreak he left and went to a deserted place, while the crowds kept looking for him. When they came to him, they tried to keep him from leaving them.
42Lk 4:43 But he said to them, "I have to proclaim the good news about the kingdom of God in other cities, because I was sent to do that also."
42Lk 4:44 So he continued to preach in the synagogues of Galilee.
42Lk 5:1 One day as the crowd was pressing in on him to listen to God's word, Jesus was standing by the lake of Gennesaret.
42Lk 5:2 He saw two boats lying on the shore, but the fishermen had stepped out of them and were washing their nets.
42Lk 5:3 So Jesus got into one of the boats (the one that belonged to Simon) and asked him to push out a little from the shore. Then he sat down and began to teach the crowds from the boat.2
42Lk 5:4 When he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, "Push out into deep water, and lower your nets for a catch." 
42Lk 5:5 Simon answered, "Master, we have worked hard all night and caught nothing. But if you say so, I'll lower the nets."
42Lk 5:6 After the men had done this, they caught so many fish that the nets began to tear.
42Lk 5:7 So they signaled to their partners in the other boat to come and help them. They came and filled both boats until the boats began to sink.
42Lk 5:8 When Simon Peter saw this, he fell down at Jesus' knees and said, "Leave me, Lord! I am a sinful man!" - 
42Lk 5:9 because Simon and all the people who were with him were amazed at the number of fish they had caught,
42Lk 5:10 and so were James and John, Zebedee's sons and Simon's partners. Then Jesus said to Simon, "Stop being afraid. From now on you will be catching people."
42Lk 5:11 So when they brought the boats to shore, they left everything and followed Jesus.
42Lk 5:12 One day while Jesus was in one of the cities, a man covered with leprosy saw Jesus and fell on his face, begging him, "Lord, if you want to, you can make me clean." 
42Lk 5:13 So Jesus reached out his hand and touched him, saying, "I do want to. Be clean!" Instantly the leprosy left him.
42Lk 5:14 Then Jesus ordered him, "Don't tell anyone. Instead, go and show yourself to the priest and make an offering for your cleansing, just as Moses commanded, as proof to the authorities."
42Lk 5:15 But the news about Jesus spread even more, and many crowds began gathering to hear him and to be healed of their diseases.
42Lk 5:16 However, he continued his habit of retiring to deserted places and praying. 
42Lk 5:17 One day as Jesus was teaching, some Pharisees and teachers of the law happened to be sitting near by. The people had come from every village in Galilee and Judea and from Jerusalem. The power of the Lord was present to heal them.
42Lk 5:18 Some men were bringing a paralyzed man on a stretcher. They were trying to take him into the house and place him in front of Jesus.
42Lk 5:19 When they couldn't find a way to get him in because of the crowd, they went up on the roof and let him down on his stretcher through the tiles into the middle of the room, right in front of Jesus.
42Lk 5:20 When Jesus saw their faith, he said, "Mister, your sins are forgiven."
42Lk 5:21 The scribes and the Pharisees began to argue among themselves, saying, "Who is this man who is uttering blasphemies? Who can forgive sins but God alone?" 
42Lk 5:22 Because Jesus knew that they were arguing, he asked them, "Why are you arguing about this among yourselves - 
42Lk 5:23 Which is easier£º to say 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say 'Get up and walk' - 
42Lk 5:24 But I want you to know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins." Then he said to the paralyzed man, "I say to you£º Get up, pick up your stretcher, and go home!"
42Lk 5:25 So the man immediately stood up in front of them and picked up what he had been lying on. Then he went home, praising God.
42Lk 5:26 Amazement seized all the people, and they began to praise God. They were filled with fear and declared, "We have seen wonderful things today!"
42Lk 5:27 After that, Jesus went out and saw a tax collector named Levi sitting at the tax collector's desk. He said to him, "Follow me!"
42Lk 5:28 So Levi left everything behind, got up, and followed him.
42Lk 5:29 Then Levi gave a large banquet at his home for Jesus. A large crowd of tax collectors and others were eating with them.
42Lk 5:30 The Pharisees and their scribes started complaining to Jesus' disciples, "Why do you eat and drink with tax collectors and sinners?"
42Lk 5:31 But Jesus answered them, "Healthy people don't need a physician, but sick people do.
42Lk 5:32 I have not come to call righteous people, but sinners, to repentance." 
42Lk 5:33 Then they said to him, "John's disciples frequently fast and pray, and so do those of the Pharisees. But your disciples keep right on eating and drinking."5
42Lk 5:34 But Jesus said to them, "You can't force the wedding guests to fast while the groom is still with them, can you - 
42Lk 5:35 But the time will come when the groom will be taken away from them, and at that time they will fast."
42Lk 5:36 Then he told them a parable£º "No one tears a piece of cloth from a new garment and sews it on an old garment. If he does, the new cloth will tear, and the piece from the new will not match the old.
42Lk 5:37 And no one pours new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the new wine will make the skins burst, the wine will be spilled, and the skins will be ruined.
42Lk 5:38 Rather, new wine is to be poured into fresh wineskins.
42Lk 5:39 No one who has been drinking old wine wants new wine, because he says, 'The old wine is good enough!'"5
42Lk 6:1 One time Jesus was walking through some grain fields on a Sabbath. His disciples were picking the heads of grain, rubbing them in their hands, and eating them.
42Lk 6:2 Some of the Pharisees asked, "Why are you doing what is not lawful on Sabbath days?" 
42Lk 6:3 Jesus answered them, "Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions became hungry - 
42Lk 6:4 How was it that he went into the house of God, took the Bread of the Presence and ate it, which was not lawful for anyone but the priests to eat, and then gave some of it to his companions?"
42Lk 6:5 Then he said to them, "The Son of Man is Lord of the Sabbath."
42Lk 6:6 Once, on another Sabbath, Jesus went into a synagogue and began teaching. A man whose right hand was paralyzed was there.
42Lk 6:7 The scribes and the Pharisees were watching Jesus closely to see whether he would heal on the Sabbath, in order to find a way of accusing him of doing something wrong.
42Lk 6:8 But Jesus knew what they were thinking. So he said to the man with the paralyzed hand, "Get up, and stand in the middle of the synagogue." So he got up and stood there.
42Lk 6:9 Then Jesus asked them, "I ask you, is it lawful to do good or to do evil on the Sabbath, to save a life or to destroy it?"
42Lk 6:10 He looked around at all of them and then said to the man, "Hold out your hand." The man did so, and his hand was restored to health.
42Lk 6:11 The others were furious and began to discuss with each other what they could do to Jesus.
42Lk 6:12 Now it was in those days that Jesus went to a mountain to pray, and he spent the whole night in prayer to God.
42Lk 6:13 When daylight came, he called his disciples and chose twelve of them, whom he also called apostles£º
42Lk 6:14 Simon (whom he named Peter), his brother Andrew, James, John, Philip, Bartholomew,
42Lk 6:15 Matthew, Thomas, James (the son of Alphaeus), Simon (who was called the Zealot),
42Lk 6:16 Judas (the son of James), and Judas Iscariot (who became a traitor). 
42Lk 6:17 Then Jesus came down with them and stood on a level place, along with many of his disciples and a large gathering of people from all over Judea, Jerusalem, and the seacoast of Tyre and Sidon.
42Lk 6:18 They had come to hear him and to be healed of their diseases. Even those who were being tormented by unclean spirits were being healed.
42Lk 6:19 The entire crowd was trying to touch him, because power was coming out from him and healing all of them.18
42Lk 6:20 Then Jesus looked at his disciples and said, "How blessed are you who are destitute, because the kingdom of God is yours!
42Lk 6:21 How blessed are you who are hungry now, because you will be satisfied! How blessed are you who are crying now, because you will laugh!
42Lk 6:22 How blessed are you whenever people hate you, avoid you, insult you, and slander you because of the Son of Man!
42Lk 6:23 Rejoice in that day and leap for joy, because your reward in heaven is great! That's the way their ancestors used to treat the prophets. 
42Lk 6:24 "But how terrible it will be for you who are rich, because you have had your comfort!
42Lk 6:25 How terrible it will be for you who are full now, because you will be hungry! How terrible it will be for you who are laughing now, because you will mourn and cry!
42Lk 6:26 How terrible it will be for you when everyone says nice things about you, because that's the way their ancestors used to treat the false prophets!" 
42Lk 6:27 "But I say to you who are listening£º Love your enemies. Do good to those who hate you.
42Lk 6:28 Bless those who curse you, and pray for those who insult you.
42Lk 6:29 If someone strikes you on the cheek, offer him the other one as well, and if someone takes your coat, don't keep back your shirt, either.
42Lk 6:30 Keep on giving to everyone who asks you for something, and if anyone takes what is yours, do not insist on getting it back.
42Lk 6:31 Whatever you want people to do for you, do the same for them. 
42Lk 6:32 "If you love those who love you, what thanks do you deserve? Why, even sinners love those who love them.
42Lk 6:33 If you do good to those who do good to you, what thanks do you deserve? Even sinners do that.
42Lk 6:34 If you lend to those from whom you expect to get something back, what thanks do you deserve? Even sinners lend to sinners to get back what they lend.
42Lk 6:35 Rather, love your enemies, do good to them, and lend to them, expecting nothing in return. Then your reward will be great, and you will be children of the Most High, because he is kind even to ungrateful and evil people.
42Lk 6:36 Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful." 
42Lk 6:37 "Stop judging, and you will never be judged. Stop condemning, and you will never be condemned. Forgive, and you will be forgiven.
42Lk 6:38 Give, and it will be given to you. A large quantity, pressed together, shaken down, and running over will be put into your lap, because you will be evaluated by the same standard with which you evaluate others." 
42Lk 6:39 He also told them a parable£º "One blind person can't lead another blind person, can he? Both will fall into a ditch, won't they - 
42Lk 6:40 A disciple is not better than his teacher. But everyone who is fully-trained will be like his teacher. 
42Lk 6:41 "Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye but fail to notice the beam in your own eye - 
42Lk 6:42 How can you say to your brother, 'Brother, let me take the speck out of your eye,' when you don't see the beam in your own eye? You hypocrite! First remove the beam from your own eye, and then you'll see clearly enough to remove the speck from your brother's eye." 
42Lk 6:43 "A good tree doesn't produce rotten fruit, and a rotten tree doesn't produce good fruit,
42Lk 6:44 because every tree is known by its own fruit. People don't gather figs from thorny plants or pick grapes from a thorn bush.
42Lk 6:45 A good person produces good from the good treasure of his heart, and an evil person produces evil from an evil treasure, because the mouth speaks from the overflow of the heart." 
42Lk 6:46 "Why do you keep calling me 'Lord, Lord,' but don't do what I tell you - 
42Lk 6:47 I will show you what everyone is like who comes to me, hears my words, and acts on them.
42Lk 6:48 They are like a person building a house, who dug a deep hole to lay the foundation on rock. When a flood came, the floodwaters pushed against that house but couldn't shake it, because it had been founded on the rock.
42Lk 6:49 But the person who hears what I say but doesn't act on it is like someone who built a house on the ground without any foundation. When the floodwaters pushed against it, that house quickly collapsed, and the resulting destruction of that house was extensive."
42Lk 7:1 After Jesus had finished saying all these things to the people who were there listening, he went to Capernaum.
42Lk 7:2 There a centurion's servant, whom he valued highly, was sick and about to die.
42Lk 7:3 When the centurion heard about Jesus, he sent some Jewish elders to him to ask him to come and save his servant's life.
42Lk 7:4 So they went to Jesus and begged him repeatedly, "He deserves to have this done for him,
42Lk 7:5 because he loves our people and built our synagogue for us."
42Lk 7:6 So Jesus went with them. He was not far from the house when the centurion sent friends to tell Jesus, "Sir, stop troubling yourself, because I'm not worthy to have you come under my roof.
42Lk 7:7 That's why I didn't presume to come to you. But just say the word, and let my servant be healed,
42Lk 7:8 because I, too, am a man under authority and have soldiers under me. I say to one 'Go' and he goes, to another 'Come' and he comes, and to my servant 'Do this' and he does it."
42Lk 7:9 When Jesus heard this, he was amazed at him. Turning to the crowd that was following him, he said, "I tell you, not even in Israel have I found this kind of faith!"
42Lk 7:10 Then the men who had been sent returned to the house and found the servant in perfect health.
42Lk 7:11 Soon afterwards, Jesus went to a city called Nain. His disciples and a large crowd were going along with him.
42Lk 7:12 As he approached the entrance to the city, a man who had died was being carried out. He was his mother's only son, and she was a widow. A large crowd from the city was with her.
42Lk 7:13 When the Lord saw her, he felt compassion for her. He said to her, "You can stop crying."
42Lk 7:14 Then he went up and touched the bier, and the men who were carrying it stopped. He said, "Young man, I say to you, get up!"
42Lk 7:15 The man who had been dead sat up and began to speak, and Jesus gave him back to his mother.14
42Lk 7:16 Fear gripped everyone, and they began to praise God, saying, "A great prophet has appeared among us," and "God has helped his people."
42Lk 7:17 This news about Jesus spread throughout Judea and all the surrounding countryside.
42Lk 7:18 John's disciples told him about all these things. So John called two of his disciples
42Lk 7:19 and sent them to the Lord to ask, "Are you the Coming One, or should we wait for someone else?"
42Lk 7:20 When the men had come to Jesus, they said, "John the Baptist has sent us to you to ask, 'Are you the Coming One, or should we wait for someone else?'"
42Lk 7:21 At that time Jesus had healed many people of diseases, plagues, and evil spirits and had given sight to many who were blind.
42Lk 7:22 So he answered them, "Go and tell John what you have observed and heard£º the blind see, the lame walk, lepers are cleansed, the deaf hear again, the dead are raised, and the destitute hear the good news.
42Lk 7:23 How blessed is anyone who is not offended by me!"
42Lk 7:24 When John's messengers had gone, Jesus began to ask the crowds about John. "What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind - 
42Lk 7:25 Really, what did you go out to see? A man dressed in fancy clothes? See, those who wear fine clothes and live in luxury are in royal palaces.
42Lk 7:26 Really, what did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and even more than a prophet!
42Lk 7:27 This is the man about whom it is written, 'See, I am sending my messenger ahead of you, who will prepare your way before you.'
42Lk 7:28 I tell you, no one has ever been born who is greater than John. Yet even the least important person in the kingdom of God is greater than he."
42Lk 7:29 By having been baptized with John's baptism, all the people who listened, including the tax collectors, acknowledged God's justice.
42Lk 7:30 But the Pharisees and the experts in the law rejected God's plan for themselves by refusing to be baptized by John. 
42Lk 7:31 Jesus continued, "To what may I compare the people living today? 
42Lk 7:32 They are like little children who sit in the marketplace and shout to each other, 'A wedding song we played for you, the dance you simply scorned. A woeful dirge we chanted, too, but then you did not mourn.'
42Lk 7:33 Because John the Baptist has come neither eating bread nor drinking wine, yet you say, 'He has a demon!'
42Lk 7:34 The Son of Man has come eating and drinking, and you say, 'Look! He's a glutton and a drunk, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!'
42Lk 7:35 Wisdom is vindicated by all her children."
42Lk 7:36 Now one of the Pharisees invited Jesus to eat with him. So he went to the Pharisee's home and took his place at the table.
42Lk 7:37 There was a woman who was a notorious sinner in that city. When she learned that Jesus was eating at the Pharisee's home, she took an alabaster jar of perfume
42Lk 7:38 and knelt at his feet behind him. She was crying and began to wash his feet with her tears and dry them with her hair. Then she kissed his feet over and over again, anointing them constantly with the perfume.
42Lk 7:39 Now the Pharisee who had invited Jesus saw this and said to himself, "If this man were a prophet, he would have known who is touching him and what kind of woman she is. She's a sinner!" 
42Lk 7:40 Jesus said to him, "Simon, I have something to ask you.""Teacher," he replied, "ask it."
42Lk 7:41 "Two men were in debt to a moneylender. One owed him50 0 denarii, and the other50 .
42Lk 7:42 When they couldn't pay it back, he generously canceled the debts for both of them. Now which of them will love him more?"
42Lk 7:43 Simon answered, "I suppose the one who had the larger debt canceled."Jesus said to him, "You have answered correctly."
42Lk 7:44 Then, turning to the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman? I came into your house. You didn't give me any water for my feet, but this woman has washed my feet with her tears and dried them with her hair.
42Lk 7:45 You didn't give me a kiss, but this woman, from the moment I came in, has not stopped kissing my feet.
42Lk 7:46 You didn't anoint my head with oil, but this woman has anointed my feet with perfume.
42Lk 7:47 So I'm telling you that her sins, as many as they are, have been forgiven, and that's why she has shown such great love. But the one to whom little is forgiven loves little."
42Lk 7:48 Then Jesus said to the woman, "Your sins are forgiven!"7
42Lk 7:49 Those who were at the table with them began to say among themselves, "Who is this man who even forgives sins?"7
42Lk 7:50 But Jesus said to the woman, "Your faith had saved you. Go in peace."
42Lk 8:1 After this, Jesus traveled from one city and village to another, preaching and spreading the good news about God's kingdom. His twelve disciples were with him,
42Lk 8:2 as well as some women who had been healed of evil spirits and illnesses£º Mary, also called Magdalene, from whom seven demons had gone out;
42Lk 8:3 Joanna, the wife of Herod's household manager Chuza; Susanna; and many others. These women continued to support them out of their personal resources.1
42Lk 8:4 Now while a large crowd was gathering and people were coming to Jesus from every city, he said in a parable£º
42Lk 8:5 "A farmer went out to sow his seed. As he was sowing, some seeds fell along the path, were trampled on, and birds from the sky ate them up.
42Lk 8:6 Others fell on stony ground, and as soon as they came up, they dried up because they had no moisture.
42Lk 8:7 Others fell among thorn bushes, and the thorn bushes grew with them and choked them.
42Lk 8:8 But others fell on good soil, and when they came up, they produced a hundred times as much as was planted." As he said this, he called out, "Let the person who has ears to hear, listen!"
42Lk 8:9 Then his disciples began to ask him what this parable meant.
42Lk 8:10 So he said, "You have been given knowledge about the secrets of the kingdom of God. But to others they are given in parables, so that 'they might look but not see, and they might listen but not understand.'"
42Lk 8:11 "Now this is what the parable means. The seed is God's word.
42Lk 8:12 The ones on the path are the people who listen, but then the devil comes and takes the word away from their hearts, so that they may not believe and be saved.
42Lk 8:13 The ones on the stony ground are the people who joyfully welcome the word when they hear it. But since they don't have any roots, they believe for a while, but in a time of testing they fall away.
42Lk 8:14 The ones that fell among the thorn bushes are the people who listen, but as they go on their way they are choked by the worries, wealth, and pleasures of life, and their fruit doesn't mature.
42Lk 8:15 But the ones on the good soil are the people who hear the word but also hold on to it with good and honest hearts, producing a crop through endurance."
42Lk 8:16 "No one lights a lamp and hides it under a bowl or puts it under a bed. Instead, he puts it on a lamp stand so that those who come in will see the light.
42Lk 8:17 There is nothing hidden that will not be revealed, and there is nothing secret that will not become known and come to light.
42Lk 8:18 So pay attention to how you listen, because to the one who has something, more will be given. However, from the one who doesn't have, even what he thinks he has will be taken away from him." 
42Lk 8:19 His mother and his brothers came to him, but they couldn't get near him because of the crowd.
42Lk 8:20 Jesus was told, "Your mother and your brothers are standing outside and want to see you."
42Lk 8:21 But he answered those people, "My mother and my brothers are those who hear the word of God and do it."
42Lk 8:22 One day Jesus and his disciples got into a boat. He said to them, "Let's cross to the other side of the lake." So they started out. 
42Lk 8:23 Now as they were sailing, Jesus fell asleep. A violent storm swept over the lake, and they were taking on water and were in great danger.
42Lk 8:24 So his disciples went to him, woke him up, and kept telling him, "Master! Master! We're going to die!" He got up and rebuked the wind and the raging waves. They stopped, and there was calm.
42Lk 8:25 Then he asked the disciples, "Where's your faith?" Frightened and amazed, they asked one another, "Who is this man? He commands even the winds and the water, and they obey him!"
42Lk 8:26 They landed in the region of the Gerasenes, which is just across the lake from Galilee.
42Lk 8:27 When Jesus stepped out on the shore, a man from the city met him. This man was controlled by demons and had not worn clothes for a long time. He did not live in a house but in the tombs.
42Lk 8:28 When he saw Jesus, he screamed, fell down in front of him, and cried out in a loud voice, "What do you want from me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I beg you not to torture me!"
42Lk 8:29 because Jesus was in the process of ordering the unclean spirit to come out of the man. On many occasions the unclean spirit had seized the man, and though he was kept under guard and bound with chains and shackles, he would break the chains and be driven by the demon into deserted places.27
42Lk 8:30 Jesus asked the man, "What's your name?" He answered, "Legion," because many demons had gone into him.
42Lk 8:31 Then the demons began begging Jesus not to order them to go into the bottomless pit. 
42Lk 8:32 Now a large herd of pigs was grazing there on the hillside. So the demons begged Jesus to let them go into those pigs, and he consented to that.
42Lk 8:33 Then the demons came out of the man and went into the pigs, and the herd rushed down the cliff into the lake and drowned.
42Lk 8:34 Now when those who had been taking care of the pigs saw what had happened, they ran away and reported it in the city and in the countryside.
42Lk 8:35 So the people went out to see what had happened. When they came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out sitting at Jesus' feet, dressed and in his right mind, they were frightened.
42Lk 8:36 The people who had seen it told them how the demon-possessed man had been healed.
42Lk 8:37 Then all the people from the region surrounding the Gerasenes asked Jesus to leave them, because they were terrified. So he got into a boat and started back. 
42Lk 8:38 Now the man from whom the demons had gone out kept begging Jesus to let him go with him. But Jesus sent him away, saying,
42Lk 8:39 "Go home and tell what God has done for you." So the man left and kept proclaiming throughout the whole city how much Jesus had done for him.
42Lk 8:40 When Jesus came back, the crowd welcomed him, because everyone was expecting him.
42Lk 8:41 Just then a synagogue leader by the name of Jairus arrived. He fell at Jesus' feet and kept begging him to come to his home,
42Lk 8:42 because his only daughter, who was about twelve years old, was dying. While Jesus was on his way, the crowds continued to press in on him.
42Lk 8:43 A woman was there who had been suffering from chronic bleeding for twelve years. Although she had spent all she had on doctors, no one could heal her.
42Lk 8:44 She came up behind Jesus and touched the tassel of his garment, and her bleeding stopped at once.
42Lk 8:45 Jesus asked, "Who touched me?" While everyone was denying it, Peter and those who were with him said, "Master, the crowds are surrounding you and pressing in on you."
42Lk 8:46 Still Jesus said, "Somebody touched me, because I know that power has gone out of me." 
42Lk 8:47 When the woman saw that she couldn't hide, she came forward trembling. Bowing down in front of him, she explained in the presence of all the people why she had touched Jesus and how she had been instantly healed.
42Lk 8:48 Then he said to her, "Daughter, your faith has made you well. Go in peace."47
42Lk 8:49 While he was still speaking, someone came from the synagogue leader's home and told him, "Your daughter is dead. Stop bothering the teacher anymore."8
42Lk 8:50 But when Jesus heard this, he told the synagogue leader, "Stop being afraid! Just believe, and she will get well."
42Lk 8:51 When he arrived at the man's house, he allowed no one to go in with him except Peter, John, James, and the young girl's father and mother.
42Lk 8:52 Now everyone was crying and wailing for her. But Jesus said, "Stop crying! She's not dead. She's sleeping."
42Lk 8:53 They laughed and laughed at him, because they knew she was dead.
42Lk 8:54 But he took her hand and called out, "Young lady, get up!"
42Lk 8:55 So her spirit returned, and she got up at once. Then Jesus directed that she be given something to eat.
42Lk 8:56 Her parents were amazed, but he ordered them not to tell anyone what had happened. 
42Lk 9:1 Jesus called his twelve disciples together and gave them power and authority over all the demons and to heal diseases.
42Lk 9:2 Then he sent them to proclaim the kingdom of God and to heal the sick.
42Lk 9:3 He told them, "Don't take anything along on your trip - no walking stick, traveling bag, bread, money, or even an extra shirt.
42Lk 9:4 When you visit a home and stay there, and go out from there,
42Lk 9:5 if people don't welcome you, when you leave that city, shake its dust off your feet as a testimony against them."
42Lk 9:6 So they left and went from village to village, spreading the good news and healing diseases everywhere.3
42Lk 9:7 Now Herod the tetrarch heard about everything that was happening. He was puzzled because it was said by some that John had been raised from the dead,
42Lk 9:8 by others that Elijah had appeared, and by still others that one of the ancient prophets had come back to life.
42Lk 9:9 Herod said, "I beheaded John. But who is this man I'm hearing so much about?" So Herod kept trying to see Jesus.
42Lk 9:10 The apostles came back and told Jesus everything they had done. Then he took them away with him privately to a city called Bethsaida.
42Lk 9:11 But the crowds found out about this and followed him. He welcomed them and began to speak to them about the kingdom of God and to heal those who needed healing.
42Lk 9:12 As the day was drawing to a close, the twelve disciples came to him and said, "Send the crowd away to the neighboring villages and farms so they can rest and get some food, because we are here in a deserted place." 
42Lk 9:13 But he said to them, "You give them something to eat."  They replied, "We have nothing more than five loaves of bread and two fish - unless we go and buy food for all these people."
42Lk 9:14 Now there were about 5,000 men. So he said to his disciples, "Have them sit down in groups of about50 ."
42Lk 9:15 They did this and got all of them seated.
42Lk 9:16 Taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and blessed them. Then he broke the loaves in pieces and kept giving them to the disciples to pass on to the crowd.
42Lk 9:17 All of them ate and were filled. When they collected the leftover pieces, there were twelve baskets.
42Lk 9:18 One day while Jesus was praying privately and the disciples were with him, he asked them, "Who do the crowds say I am?"
42Lk 9:19 They answered, "Some say John the Baptist, others Elijah, and still others one of the ancient prophets who has come back to life." 
42Lk 9:20 He asked them, "But who do you say I am?" "God's Messiah," Peter replied.
42Lk 9:21 He gave them strict orders, commanding them not to tell this to anyone.
42Lk 9:22 He said, "The Son of Man must suffer a great deal and be rejected by the elders, the high priests, and the scribes. Then he must be killed, but on the third day he will be raised." 
42Lk 9:23 Then he said to all of them, "If anyone wants to come with me, he must deny himself, pick up his cross every day, and follow me continually,
42Lk 9:24 because whoever wants to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will save it.
42Lk 9:25 What profit will a person have if he gains the whole world, but destroys himself or is lost - 
42Lk 9:26 If anyone is ashamed of me and my words, the Son of Man will be ashamed of him when he comes in his glory and the glory of the Father and the holy angels.
42Lk 9:27 I tell you with certainty, some people who are standing here will not experience death until they see the kingdom of God." 
42Lk 9:28 Now about eight days after Jesus said this, he took Peter, John, and James with him and went up on a mountain to pray.
42Lk 9:29 While he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes turned dazzling white.
42Lk 9:30 Suddenly, two men were talking with him. They were Moses and Elijah.
42Lk 9:31 They had a glorified appearance, and were discussing Jesus' departure that he would shortly bring about in Jerusalem.
42Lk 9:32 Now Peter and the men with him had been overcome by sleep. When they woke up, they saw Jesus' glory and the two men standing with him.
42Lk 9:33 Just as Moses and Elijah were leaving, Peter said to Jesus, "Master, it's good that we're here! Let's set up three shelters - one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah." (Peter didn't know what he was saying.)
42Lk 9:34 But while he was saying this, a cloud appeared and surrounded them, and they became terrified as they were being overshadowed by the cloud.
42Lk 9:35 Then a voice came out of the cloud and said, "This is my Son, whom I have chosen. Keep listening to him!"
42Lk 9:36 After the voice had spoken, Jesus was alone. The disciples kept silent and at that time told no one about what they had seen. 
42Lk 9:37 The next day, when they had come down from the mountain, a large crowd met Jesus.
42Lk 9:38 Suddenly a man in the crowd shouted, "Teacher, I beg you to look at my son, because he is my only child.
42Lk 9:39 Without warning a spirit takes control of him, and he suddenly screams, goes into convulsions, and foams at the mouth. The spirit mauls him and refuses to leave him.
42Lk 9:40 I begged your disciples to drive it out, but they couldn't."37
42Lk 9:41 Jesus answered, "You unbelieving and perverted generation! How much longer must I be with you and put up with you? Bring your son here!"
42Lk 9:42 Even while the boy was coming, the demon knocked him to the ground and threw him into convulsions. But Jesus rebuked the unclean spirit, healed the boy, and gave him back to his father.
42Lk 9:43 All the people continued to be amazed at the greatness of God. Indeed, everyone was astonished at all the things Jesus was doing. So he said to his disciples,
42Lk 9:44 "Listen carefully to these words. The Son of Man is going to be betrayed into human hands."
42Lk 9:45 But they didn't know what this meant. Indeed, the meaning was hidden from them so that they didn't understand it; and they were afraid to ask him about this statement. 
42Lk 9:46 Later, an argument started among the disciples as to which of them might be the greatest.
42Lk 9:47 But Jesus, knowing their inner thoughts, took a little child and had him stand beside him.
42Lk 9:48 Then he said to them, "Whoever welcomes this little child in my name welcomes me, and whoever welcomes me welcomes the one who sent me, because the one who is least among all of you is the one who is greatest."947
42Lk 9:49 John said, "Master, we saw someone driving out demons in your name. We tried to stop him, because he wasn't a follower like us." 
42Lk 9:50 Jesus said to him, "Don't stop him! Because whoever is not against you is for you." 
42Lk 9:51 When the days grew closer for Jesus to be taken up to heaven, he was determined to continue his journey to Jerusalem.
42Lk 9:52 So he sent messengers on ahead of him. On their way they went into a Samaritan village to get things ready for him.
42Lk 9:53 But the people would not welcome him, because he was determined to go to Jerusalem.
42Lk 9:54 When his disciples James and John observed this rejection, they asked, "Lord, do you want us to call fire down from heaven to destroy them?"
42Lk 9:55 But he turned and rebuked them,
42Lk 9:56 and they all went on to another village. 
42Lk 9:57 While they were walking along the road, a man said to him, "I will follow you wherever you go." 
42Lk 9:58 Jesus told him, "Foxes have holes and birds have nests, but the Son of Man has no place to rest."
42Lk 9:59 He told another man, "Follow me."But he said, "Lord, first let me go and bury my father." 
42Lk 9:60 But he told him, "Let the dead bury their own dead. But you go and proclaim the kingdom of God."
42Lk 9:61 Still another man said, "I will follow you, Lord, but first let me say goodbye to those at home." 
42Lk 9:62 Jesus told him, "No one who puts his hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God."
42Lk 10:1 After this, the Lord appointed seventy other disciples and was about to send them ahead of him in pairs to every town and place that he intended to go.
42Lk 10:2 So he instructed them, "The harvest is vast, but the workers are few. So ask the Lord of the harvest to send workers out into his harvest.
42Lk 10:3 Get going! See, I am sending you out like lambs among wolves.
42Lk 10:4 Don't carry a wallet, a traveling bag, or sandals, and don't greet anyone on the way.
42Lk 10:5 "Whatever house you go into, first say, 'May there be peace in this house.'
42Lk 10:6 If a peaceful person lives there, your greeting of peace will remain with him. But if that's not the case, your greeting will come back to you.
42Lk 10:7 Stay with the same family, eating and drinking whatever they provide, because the worker deserves his pay. Don't move from house to house.6
42Lk 10:8 "Whenever you go into a town and the people welcome you, eat whatever they serve you,
42Lk 10:9 heal the sick that are there, and tell them, 'The kingdom of God is near you!'
42Lk 10:10 But whenever you go into a town and people don't welcome you, go out into its streets and say,
42Lk 10:11 'We are wiping off your town's dust that clings to our feet in protest against you! But realize this£º the kingdom of God is near!'
42Lk 10:12 I tell you, on the last day it will be easier for Sodom than for that town!"10
42Lk 10:13 "How terrible it will be for you, Chorazin! How terrible it will be for you, Bethsaida! If the miracles that happened in you had taken place in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago, sitting in sackcloth and ashes.
42Lk 10:14 It will be easier for Tyre and Sidon at the judgment than for you!13
42Lk 10:15 And you, Capernaum! You won't be lifted up to heaven, will you? You'll go down to Hell!
42Lk 10:16 The person who listens to you listens to me, and the person who rejects you rejects me. The person who rejects me rejects the one who sent me." 
42Lk 10:17 The seventy disciples came back and joyously reported, "Lord, even the demons are submitting to us in your name!" 
42Lk 10:18 He said to them, "I watched Satan falling from heaven like lightning.
42Lk 10:19 Look! I have given you the authority to trample on snakes and scorpions and to destroy all the enemy's power, and nothing will ever hurt you.
42Lk 10:20 However, stop rejoicing because the spirits are submitting to you. Rather, rejoice because your names are written in heaven." 
42Lk 10:21 At that moment, the Holy Spirit made Jesus extremely joyful, so Jesus said, "I praise you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, because you have hidden these things from wise and intelligent people and have revealed them to infants. Yes, Father, because this is what was pleasing to you.
42Lk 10:22 "All things have been entrusted to me by my Father. No one knows who the Son is except the Father, and no one knows who the Father is except the Son and the person to whom the Son chooses to reveal him."
42Lk 10:23 Then turning to his disciples in private, he said to them, "How blessed are the eyes that see what you see!
42Lk 10:24 Because I tell you, many prophets and kings wanted to see the things you see but didn't see them, and to hear the things you hear but didn't hear them." 
42Lk 10:25 Just then an expert in the law stood up to test Jesus. He asked, "Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" 
42Lk 10:26 Jesus answered him, "What is written in the law? What do you read there?"
42Lk 10:27 He answered, "You must love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind. And you must love your neighbor as yourself."
42Lk 10:28 Jesus told him, "You have answered correctly. 'Do this, and you will live.'"
42Lk 10:29 But the man wanted to justify himself, so he asked Jesus, "And who is my neighbor?" 
42Lk 10:30 After careful consideration, Jesus replied, "A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho when he fell into the hands of bandits. They stripped him, beat him, and went away, leaving him half dead.
42Lk 10:31 By chance, a priest was traveling along that road. When he saw the man, he went by on the other side.
42Lk 10:32 Similarly, a Levite came to that place. When he saw the man, he also went by on the other side.
42Lk 10:33 But as he was traveling along, a Samaritan came across the man. When the Samaritan saw him, he was moved with compassion.
42Lk 10:34 He went to him and bandaged his wounds, pouring oil and wine on them. Then he put him on his own animal, brought him to an inn, and took care of him.
42Lk 10:35 The next day he took out two denarii and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, 'Take good care of him. If you spend more than that, I'll repay you when I come back.'31
42Lk 10:36 "Of these three men, who do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of the bandits?"
42Lk 10:37 He said, "The one who showed mercy to him." Jesus told him, "Go and do what he did."
42Lk 10:38 Now as they were traveling along, Jesus went into a village. A woman named Martha welcomed him into her home.
42Lk 10:39 She had a sister named Mary, who sat down at the Lord's feet and kept listening to what he was saying.
42Lk 10:40 But Martha was worrying about all the things she had to do, so she came to him and asked, "Lord, you do care that my sister has left me to do the work all by myself, don't you? Then tell her to help me."1039
42Lk 10:41 The Lord answered her, "Martha, Martha! You worry and fuss about a lot of things.
42Lk 10:42 But there's only one thing you need. Mary has chosen what is better, and it is not to be taken away from her." 
42Lk 11:1 Once Jesus was praying in a certain place. After he had finished, one of his disciples said to him, "Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples."
42Lk 11:2 So he told them, "Whenever you pray you are to say, 'Father, may your name be kept holy. May your kingdom come.
42Lk 11:3 Keep giving us every day our daily bread,
42Lk 11:4 and forgive us our sins, as we forgive everyone who sins against us. And never bring us into temptation.'"
42Lk 11:5 Then he said to them, "Suppose one of you has a friend, and you go to him at midnight and say to him, 'Friend, let me borrow three loaves of bread.
42Lk 11:6 A friend of mine on a trip has dropped in on me, and I don't have anything to serve him.'
42Lk 11:7 Suppose he answers from inside, 'Stop bothering me! The door is already locked, and my children are here with us in the bedroom. I can't get up and give you anything!'
42Lk 11:8 I tell you, even though that man doesn't want to get up and give him anything because he is his friend, he will get up and give him whatever he needs because of his persistence. 
42Lk 11:9 So I say to you£º Keep asking, and it will be given you. Keep searching, and you will find. Keep knocking, and the door will be opened for you,
42Lk 11:10 because everyone who keeps asking will receive, and the person who keeps searching will find, and the person who keeps knocking will have the door opened.
42Lk 11:11 "What father among you, if his son asks for bread, would give him a stone, or if he asks for a fish, would give him a snake instead of the fish - 
42Lk 11:12 Or if he asks for an egg, would he give him a scorpion - 
42Lk 11:13 So if you who are evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will the Father in heaven give the Holy Spirit to those who keep asking him!"
42Lk 11:14 Jesus was driving a demon out of a man who was unable to talk. When the demon had gone out, the man began to speak, and the crowds were amazed.
42Lk 11:15 But some of them said, "He drives out demons by Beelzebul, the ruler of the demons."
42Lk 11:16 Others, wanting to test Jesus, kept asking him for a sign from heaven. 
42Lk 11:17 Since he knew what they were thinking, he said to them, "Every kingdom divided against itself is devastated, and a divided household collapses.
42Lk 11:18 Now, if Satan is divided against himself, how can his kingdom last? After all, you say that I drive out demons by Beelzebul.
42Lk 11:19 If I drive out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your own followers drive them out? That is why they will be your judges!
42Lk 11:20 But if I drive out demons by the power of God, then the kingdom of God has come to you. 
42Lk 11:21 "When a strong man, fully armed, guards his own mansion, his property is safe.
42Lk 11:22 But when a stronger man than he attacks and defeats him, the stronger man strips off that man's armor in which he trusted and then divides his plunder.
42Lk 11:23 "The person who isn't with me is against me, and the person who doesn't gather with me scatters." 
42Lk 11:24 "Whenever an unclean spirit goes out of a person, it wanders through dry places looking for a place to rest but doesn't find any. So it says, 'I will go back to my home that I left.'
42Lk 11:25 When it gets back home, it finds it swept clean and put in order.
42Lk 11:26 Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they all go in and settle there. And so the final condition of that person is worse than the first." 
42Lk 11:27 As Jesus was saying this, a woman in the crowd raised her voice and said to him, "How blessed is the womb that gave birth to you and the breasts that nursed you!" 
42Lk 11:28 But he said, "Rather, how blessed are those who hear God's word and obey it!" 
42Lk 11:29 Now as the crowds continued to throng around Jesus, he went on to say, "This people living today are an evil generation. It craves a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah,
42Lk 11:30 because just as Jonah became a sign to the people of Nineveh, so the Son of Man will be a sign to this generation.
42Lk 11:31 The queen of the south will stand up at the judgment and condemn the people living today, because she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon. But look, something greater than Solomon is here!
42Lk 11:32 The men of Nineveh will stand up at the judgment and condemn the people living today, because they repented at the preaching of Jonah. But look, something greater than Jonah is here!"30
42Lk 11:33 "No one lights a lamp and puts it in a hiding place or under a basket, but on a lamp stand, so that those who enter may see its light.
42Lk 11:34 Your eye is the lamp of your body. When your eye is healthy, your whole body is full of light. But when it is evil, your body is full of darkness.
42Lk 11:35 Therefore, be careful that the light in you isn't darkness.
42Lk 11:36 Now if your whole body is full of light, with no part of it in darkness, it will be as full of light as when a lamp gives you light with its rays."
42Lk 11:37 After Jesus had said this, a Pharisee invited him to have a meal with him. So Jesus went and took his place at the table.
42Lk 11:38 The Pharisee was surprised to see that he didn't first wash before the meal.
42Lk 11:39 But the Lord said to him, "Now you Pharisees clean the outside of the cup and the dish, but on the inside you are full of greed and evil.
42Lk 11:40 You fools! The one who made the outside made the inside, too, didn't he - 
42Lk 11:41 So give what is inside to the poor, and then everything will be clean for you. 
42Lk 11:42 "How terrible it will be for you Pharisees! You give a tenth of your mint, spices, and every kind of herb, but you neglect justice and the love of God. These are the things you should have practiced, without neglecting the others.
42Lk 11:43 How terrible it will be for you Pharisees! You love to have the places of honor in the synagogues and to be greeted in the marketplaces.
42Lk 11:44 How terrible it will be for you! You are like unmarked graves - people walk on them without realizing it." 
42Lk 11:45 Then one of the experts in the law said to him, "Teacher, when you say these things, you insult us, too."
42Lk 11:46 Jesus said, "How terrible it will be for you experts in the law, too! You load people with burdens that are hard to carry, yet you don't even lift a finger to ease those burdens.
42Lk 11:47 How terrible it will be for you! You build monuments for the prophets, and it was your ancestors who killed them!
42Lk 11:48 So you are witnesses and approve of the deeds of your ancestors, because they killed those for whom you are building monuments.
42Lk 11:49 That is why the Wisdom of God said, 'I will send them prophets and apostles. They will kill some of them and persecute others,'
42Lk 11:50 so those living today will be charged with the blood of all the prophets that was shed since the foundation of the world,
42Lk 11:51 from the blood of Abel to the blood of Zechariah, who died between the altar and the sanctuary. Yes, I tell you, it will be charged against this generation!11
42Lk 11:52 How terrible it will be for you experts in the law! You have taken away the key to knowledge. You didn't go in yourselves, and you kept out those who were trying to go in." 
42Lk 11:53 As Jesus was leaving, the scribes and the Pharisees began to oppose him fiercely, interrogating him about many things.
42Lk 11:54 They watched him closely in an effort to trap him in something he might say. 
42Lk 12:1 Meanwhile, the people had gathered by the thousands and were trampling on one another. Jesus began to speak first to his disciples. "Watch out for the yeast - that is, the hypocrisy - of the Pharisees!
42Lk 12:2 There is nothing covered up that will not be exposed and nothing secret that will not be made known.
42Lk 12:3 Therefore, what you have said in darkness will be heard in the daylight, and what you have whispered in private rooms will be shouted from the housetops."
42Lk 12:4 "But I tell you, my friends, never be afraid of those who kill the body and after that can't do anything more.
42Lk 12:5 I'll show you the one you should be afraid of. Be afraid of the one who has the authority to throw you into hell after killing you. Yes, I tell you, be afraid of him!
42Lk 12:6 "Five sparrows are sold for two pennies, aren't they? Yet not one of them is forgotten by God.
42Lk 12:7 Why, even all the hairs on your head have been counted! Stop being afraid. You are worth more than a bunch of sparrows."
42Lk 12:8 "But I tell you, the Son of Man will acknowledge before God's angels everyone who acknowledges me before people.
42Lk 12:9 But whoever denies me before people will be denied before God's angels.
42Lk 12:10 Everyone who speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but the person who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven.
42Lk 12:11 When people bring you before synagogue leaders, rulers, or authorities, don't worry about how you will defend yourselves or what you will say,
42Lk 12:12 because at that time the Holy Spirit will teach you what you are to say."8
42Lk 12:13 Then someone in the crowd said to him, "Teacher, tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me."
42Lk 12:14 But Jesus asked him, "Mister, who appointed me to be a judge or arbitrator over you people?"
42Lk 12:15 Then he said to them, "Be careful to guard yourselves against every kind of greed, because a person's life doesn't consist of the amount of possessions he has." 
42Lk 12:16 Then he told them a parable. He said, "The land of a certain rich man produced good crops.
42Lk 12:17 So he began to think to himself, 'What should I do, since I have no place to store my crops?'
42Lk 12:18 Then he said, 'This is what I'll do. I'll tear down my barns and build bigger ones, and I'll store all my grain and goods in them.
42Lk 12:19 Then I'll say to myself, "You've stored up plenty of good things for many years. Take it easy, eat, drink, and enjoy yourself."'
42Lk 12:20 But God said to him, 'You fool! This very night your life will be demanded back from you. Now who will get the things you've accumulated?'
42Lk 12:21 That's how it is with the person who stores up treasures for himself rather than with God."
42Lk 12:22 Then Jesus said to his disciples, "That's why I'm telling you to stop worrying about your life - what you will eat - or about your body - what you will wear,
42Lk 12:23 because life is more than food, and the body more than clothing.
42Lk 12:24 Consider the crows. They don't plant or harvest, they don't even have a storeroom or barn, yet God feeds them. How much more valuable are you than birds!
42Lk 12:25 Can any of you add an hour to the length of your life by worrying - 
42Lk 12:26 So if you can't do a small thing like that, why worry about other things - 
42Lk 12:27 Consider how the lilies grow. They don't work or spin yarn, but I tell you that not even Solomon in all his splendor was clothed like one of them.
42Lk 12:28 Now if that's the way God clothes the grass in the field, which is alive today and thrown into an oven tomorrow, how much more will he clothe you - you who have little faith - 
42Lk 12:29 "So stop concerning yourselves about what you will eat or what you will drink, and stop being distressed,
42Lk 12:30 because it is the gentiles who are concerned about all these things. Surely your Father knows that you need them!
42Lk 12:31 Instead, be concerned about his kingdom, and these things will be provided for you as well.
42Lk 12:32 Stop being afraid, little flock, because your Father is pleased to give you the kingdom. 
42Lk 12:33 "Sell your possessions, and give the money to the poor. Make yourselves wallets that don't wear out - a dependable treasure in heaven, where no thief can get close and no moth can destroy anything.
42Lk 12:34 Because where your treasure is, there your heart will be also."
42Lk 12:35 "You must keep your belts fastened and your lamps burning.
42Lk 12:36 Be like people who are waiting for their master to return from a wedding. As soon as he arrives and knocks, they will open the door for him.
42Lk 12:37 How blessed are those servants whom the master finds watching for him when he comes! I tell you with certainty, he himself will put on an apron, make them sit down at the table, and go around and serve them.
42Lk 12:38 How blessed they will be if their master comes in the middle of the night or near dawn and finds them awake!
42Lk 12:39 But be sure of this£º if the homeowner had known at what time the thief were coming, he would have watched and would not have let his house be broken into.
42Lk 12:40 So be ready, because the Son of Man is coming at a time when you don't expect him."38
42Lk 12:41 Peter asked, "Lord, are you telling this parable just for us or for everyone?"
42Lk 12:42 The Lord said, "Who, then, is the faithful and careful servant manager whom his master will put in charge of giving all his other servants their share of food at the right time - 
42Lk 12:43 How blessed is that servant whom his master finds doing this when he comes!
42Lk 12:44 I tell you with certainty, he will put him in charge of all his property. 
42Lk 12:45 "But if that servant says to himself, 'My master is taking a long time to come back,' and begins to beat the other servants and to eat, drink, and get drunk,
42Lk 12:46 the master of that servant will come on a day when he doesn't expect him and at an hour that he doesn't know. Then his master will punish him severely and assign him a place with unfaithful people.
42Lk 12:47 That servant who knew what his master wanted but didn't prepare himself or do what was wanted will receive a severe beating.
42Lk 12:48 But the servant who did things that deserved a beating without knowing it will receive a light beating. Much will be required from everyone to whom much has been given. But even more will be demanded from the one to whom much has been entrusted." 
42Lk 12:49 "I've come to set the earth on fire, and how I wish it were already ablaze!
42Lk 12:50 I have a baptism to be baptized with, and what stress I am under until it's completed! 
42Lk 12:51 "Do you think that I came to bring peace on earth? Not at all, I tell you, but rather division!
42Lk 12:52 From now on, five people in one household will be divided, three against two and two against three.
42Lk 12:53 They will be divided father against son, son against father, mother against daughter, daughter against mother, mother-in-law against daughter-in-law, and daughter-in-law against mother-in-law."12
42Lk 12:54 Then Jesus said to the crowds, "When you see a cloud coming in the west, you immediately say, 'There's going to be a storm,' and that's what happens.
42Lk 12:55 When you see a south wind blowing, you say, 'It's going to be hot,' and so it is.
42Lk 12:56 You hypocrites! You know how to interpret the appearance of the earth and the sky, yet you don't know how to interpret the present time?"
42Lk 12:57 "Why don't you judge for yourselves what is right - 
42Lk 12:58 For example, when you go with your opponent in front of a ruler, do your best to settle with him on the way there. Otherwise, you will be dragged in front of the judge, and the judge will hand you over to an officer, and the officer will throw you into prison.
42Lk 12:59 I tell you, you will never get out of there until you pay back the last penny!"
42Lk 13:1 At that time, some people who were there told Jesus about the Galileans whose blood Pilate had mixed with their sacrifices.
42Lk 13:2 He asked them, "Do you think that these Galileans were more sinful than all the other Galileans because they suffered like this - 
42Lk 13:3 Absolutely not, I tell you! But if you don't repent, then you, too, will all die.
42Lk 13:4 What about those eighteen people who were killed when the tower at Siloam fell on them? Do you think they were worse offenders than all the other people living in Jerusalem - 
42Lk 13:5 Absolutely not, I tell you! But if you don't repent, then you, too, will all die."
42Lk 13:6 Then Jesus told them this parable£º "A man had a fig tree that had been planted in his vineyard. He went to look for fruit on it but didn't find any.
42Lk 13:7 So he said to the gardener, 'Look here! For three years I have been coming to look for fruit on this tree but haven't found any. Cut it down! Why should it waste the soil?'
42Lk 13:8 But the gardener replied, 'Sir, leave it alone for one more year, until I dig around it and fertilize it.
42Lk 13:9 Maybe next year it'll bear fruit. If not, then cut it down.'"
42Lk 13:10 Jesus was teaching in one of the synagogues on the Sabbath.
42Lk 13:11 A woman was there who had a spirit that had disabled her for eighteen years. She was hunched over and completely unable to stand up straight.
42Lk 13:12 When Jesus saw her, he called to her and said, "Woman, you are free from your illness."
42Lk 13:13 Then he placed his hands on her, and immediately she stood up straight and began praising God.11
42Lk 13:14 But the synagogue leader, indignant because Jesus had healed on the Sabbath, told the crowd, "There are six days when work is to be done. So come on those days to be healed, and not on the Sabbath day." 
42Lk 13:15 The Lord replied to him, "You hypocrites! Doesn't each of you on the Sabbath untie his ox or donkey and lead it out of its stall to give it some water - 
42Lk 13:16 Shouldn't this woman, a descendant of Abraham whom Satan has kept bound for eighteen long years, be set free from this bondage on the Sabbath day?"
42Lk 13:17 Even as he was saying this, all of his opponents were blushing with shame. But the rest of the crowd was rejoicing at all the wonderful things he was doing.
42Lk 13:18 So Jesus went on to say, "What is the kingdom of God like? What can I compare it to - 
42Lk 13:19 It is like a mustard seed that someone took and planted in his garden. It grew and became a tree, and the birds of the sky nested in its branches."
42Lk 13:20 Again he said, "What can I compare the kingdom of God to - 
42Lk 13:21 It is like yeast that a woman took and mixed with three measures of flour until all of it was leavened."
42Lk 13:22 Then Jesus taught in one town and village after another as he made his way to Jerusalem.
42Lk 13:23 Someone asked him, "Lord, are only a few people going to be saved?" He said to them,
42Lk 13:24 "Keep on struggling to enter through the narrow door, because I tell you that many people will try to enter, but won't be able to do so.
42Lk 13:25 After the homeowner gets up and closes the door, you can stand outside, knock on the door, and say again and again, 'Lord, open the door for us!' But he will answer you, 'I don't know where you come from.'
42Lk 13:26 Then you will say, 'We ate and drank with you, and you taught in our streets.'
42Lk 13:27 But he will tell you, 'I don't know where you come from. Get away from me, all you evildoers!'
42Lk 13:28 In that place there will be crying and gnashing of teeth when you see Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and all the prophets in the kingdom of God, and you yourselves being driven away on the outside.
42Lk 13:29 People will come from east and west, and from north and south, and will eat in the kingdom of God.
42Lk 13:30 You see, some who are last will be first, and some who are first will be last.26
42Lk 13:31 At that hour some Pharisees came and told Jesus, "Leave and get away from here, because Herod wants to kill you!"
42Lk 13:32 He said to them, "Go and tell that fox, 'Listen! I am driving out demons and healing today and tomorrow, and on the third day I will finish my work.
42Lk 13:33 But I must be on my way today, tomorrow, and the next day, because it's not possible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.'
42Lk 13:34 "O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones to death those who have been sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together as a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, but you people were unwilling!
42Lk 13:35 Look! Your house is left vacant to you. I tell you, you will not see me again until you say, 'How blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord!'"13
42Lk 14:1 One Sabbath, Jesus went to the house of a leader of the Pharisees to eat a meal. The guests were watching Jesus closely.
42Lk 14:2 A man whose body was swollen with fluid suddenly appeared in front of him.
42Lk 14:3 So Jesus asked the Pharisees and experts in the law, "Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath or not?"
42Lk 14:4 But they kept silent. So he took hold of the man, healed him, and sent him away.
42Lk 14:5 Then he asked them, "If your son or ox falls into a well on the Sabbath day, you would pull him out immediately, wouldn't you?"
42Lk 14:6 And they couldn't argue with him about this.
42Lk 14:7 When Jesus noticed how the guests were choosing the places of honor, he told them a parable.
42Lk 14:8 "When you are invited by someone to a wedding banquet, don't sit down at the place of honor in case someone more important than you was invited by the host.
42Lk 14:9 Then the host who invited both of you would come to you and say, 'Give this person your place.' In disgrace, you would have to take the place of least honor.
42Lk 14:10 But when you are invited, go and sit down at the place of least honor. Then, when your host comes, he will tell you, 'Friend, move up higher,' and you will be honored in the presence of everyone who eats with you.
42Lk 14:11 Because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the person who humbles himself will be exalted." 
42Lk 14:12 Then he told the man who had invited him, "When you give a luncheon or a dinner, stop inviting only your friends, brothers, relatives, or rich neighbors. Otherwise, they may invite you in return and you would be repaid.
42Lk 14:13 Instead, when you give a banquet, make it your habit to invite the poor, the crippled, the lame, and the blind.
42Lk 14:14 Then you will be blessed because they can't repay you. And you will be repaid when the righteous are resurrected."
42Lk 14:15 Now one of those eating with him heard this and said to him, "How blessed is the person who will eat in the kingdom of God!" 
42Lk 14:16 Jesus said to him, "A man gave a large banquet and invited many people.
42Lk 14:17 When it was time for the banquet, he sent his servant to tell those who were invited, 'Come! Everything is now ready.'
42Lk 14:18 Every single one of them began asking to be excused. The first said to him, 'I bought a field, and I need to go out and inspect it. Please excuse me.'
42Lk 14:19 Another said, 'I bought five pairs of oxen, and I'm on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.'
42Lk 14:20 Still another said, 'I recently got married, so I can't come.'
42Lk 14:21 "So the servant went back and reported all this to his master. Then the master of the house became angry and told his servant, 'Go quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring back the poor, the crippled, the blind, and the lame.'
42Lk 14:22 The servant said, 'Sir, what you ordered has been done, and there is still room.'
42Lk 14:23 Then the master told the servant, 'Go out into the streets and the lanes and make the people come in, so that my house may be full.
42Lk 14:24 Because I tell all of you, none of those men who were invited will taste anything at my banquet.'" 
42Lk 14:25 Now large crowds were traveling with Jesus. He turned and said to them,
42Lk 14:26 "If anyone comes to me and does not hate his father, mother, wife, children, brothers, and sisters, as well as his own life, he can't be my disciple.
42Lk 14:27 Whoever doesn't carry his cross and follow me can't be my disciple. 
42Lk 14:28 "Suppose one of you wants to build a tower. He will first sit down and estimate the cost to see whether he has enough money to finish it, won't he - 
42Lk 14:29 Otherwise, if he lays a foundation and can't finish the building, everyone who watches will begin to ridicule him
42Lk 14:30 and say, 'This person started a building but couldn't finish it.'
42Lk 14:31 "Or suppose a king is going to war against another king. He will first sit down and consider whether with 10,000 men he can fight the one coming against him with 20,000 men, won't he - 
42Lk 14:32 If he can't, he will send a delegation to ask for terms of peace while the other king is still far away.
42Lk 14:33 In the same way, none of you can be my disciple unless he gives up all his possessions."3214
42Lk 14:34 "Now, salt is good. But if the salt should lose its taste, how can its flavor be restored - 
42Lk 14:35 It is suitable neither for the soil nor for the manure pile. People throw it away. Let the person who has ears to hear, listen!"
42Lk 15:1 Now all the tax collectors and sinners kept coming to listen to Jesus.
42Lk 15:2 But the Pharisees and the scribes kept complaining, "This man welcomes sinners and eats with them."
42Lk 15:3 So he told them this parable£º
42Lk 15:4 "Suppose one of you has a hundred sheep and loses one of them. He leaves the ninety-nine in the wilderness and looks for the one that is lost until he finds it, doesn't he - 
42Lk 15:5 When he finds it, he puts it on his shoulders and rejoices.
42Lk 15:6 Then he goes home, calls his friends and neighbors together, and says to them, 'Rejoice with me, because I've found my lost sheep!'
42Lk 15:7 In the same way, I tell you that there will be more joy in heaven over one sinner who repents than over ninety-nine righteous people who don't need to repent." 
42Lk 15:8 "Or suppose a woman has ten coins and loses one of them. She lights a lamp, sweeps the house, and searches carefully until she finds it, doesn't she - 
42Lk 15:9 When she finds it, she calls her friends and neighbors together and says, 'Rejoice with me, because I have found the coin that I lost!'
42Lk 15:10 In the same way, I tell you that there is joy in the presence of God's angels over one sinner who repents."9
42Lk 15:11 Then Jesus said, "A man had two sons.
42Lk 15:12 The younger one said to his father, 'Father, give me my share of the estate.' So the father divided his property between them.
42Lk 15:13 A few days later, the younger son gathered everything he owned and traveled to a distant country. There he wasted it all on wild living.
42Lk 15:14 After he had spent everything, a severe famine took place throughout that country, and he began to be in need.
42Lk 15:15 So he went out to work for one of the citizens of that country, who sent him into his fields to feed pigs.
42Lk 15:16 No one would give him anything, even though he would gladly have filled himself with the husks the pigs were eating.
42Lk 15:17 "Then he came to his senses and said, 'How many of my father's hired men have more food than they can eat, and here I am starving to death!
42Lk 15:18 I will get up, go to my father, and say to him, "Father, I have sinned against heaven and you.
42Lk 15:19 I don't deserve to be called your son anymore. Treat me like one of your hired men."'
42Lk 15:20 "So he got up and went to his father. While he was still far away, his father saw him and was filled with compassion. He ran to his son, threw his arms around him, and kissed him affectionately.
42Lk 15:21 Then his son said to him, 'Father, I have sinned against heaven and you. I don't deserve to be called your son anymore.'
42Lk 15:22 But the father said to his servants, 'Hurry! Bring out the best robe and put it on him, and put a ring on his finger and sandals on his feet.
42Lk 15:23 Bring the fattened calf and kill it, and let's eat and celebrate!
42Lk 15:24 Because my son was dead and has come back to life. He was lost and has been found.' And they began to celebrate. 
42Lk 15:25 "Now the father's older son was in the field. As he was coming back to the house, he heard music and dancing.
42Lk 15:26 So he called to one of the servants and asked what was happening.
42Lk 15:27 The servant told him, 'Your brother has come home, and your father has killed the fattened calf because he got him back safely.'
42Lk 15:28 "Then the older son became angry and wouldn't go into the house. So his father came out and began to plead with him.
42Lk 15:29 But he answered his father, "Listen! All these years I've worked like a slave for you. I've never disobeyed a command of yours. Yet you've never given me so much as a young goat for a feast so I could celebrate with my friends.
42Lk 15:30 But this son of yours spent your money on prostitutes, and when he came back, you killed the fattened calf for him!'
42Lk 15:31 "His father said to him, 'My child, you are always with me, and everything I have is yours.
42Lk 15:32 But we had to celebrate and rejoice, because this brother of yours was dead and has come back to life. He was lost and has been found.'" 
42Lk 16:1 Now Jesus was saying to the disciples, "A rich man had a servant manager who was accused of wasting his assets.
42Lk 16:2 So he called for him and asked him, 'What's this I hear about you? You can't be my manager any longer. Now give me a report about your management!'
42Lk 16:3 "Then the servant manager said to himself, 'What should I do? My master is taking my position away from me. I'm not strong enough to plow, and I'm ashamed to beg.
42Lk 16:4 I know what I'll do so that people will welcome me into their homes when I'm dismissed from my job.'3
42Lk 16:5 "So he called for each of his master's debtors. He asked the first, 'How much do you owe my master?'
42Lk 16:6 The man replied, 'A hundred jars of olive oil.' The manager told him, 'Get your bill. Sit down quickly and write "50."'
42Lk 16:7 Then he asked another debtor, 'How much do you owe?' The man replied, 'A hundred containers of wheat.' The manager told him, 'Get your bill and write "80."'
42Lk 16:8 The master praised the dishonest servant manager for being so clever, because worldly people are more clever than enlightened people in dealing with their own.
42Lk 16:9 "I'm telling you, make friends for yourselves by means of unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails, they will welcome you into eternal homes.
42Lk 16:10 Whoever is faithful with very little is also faithful with a lot, and whoever is dishonest with very little is also dishonest with a lot.
42Lk 16:11 So if you haven't been faithful with unrighteous wealth, who will trust you with true wealth - 
42Lk 16:12 And if you haven't been faithful with what belongs to foreigners, who will give you what is your own - 
42Lk 16:13 "No servant can serve two masters, because either he will hate one and love the other, or be loyal to one and despise the other. You cannot serve both God and wealth!"
42Lk 16:14 Now the Pharisees, who love money, had been listening to all this and began to ridicule Jesus.
42Lk 16:15 So he said to them, "You try to justify yourselves in front of people, but God knows your hearts, because what is highly valued by people is detestable to God. 
42Lk 16:16 "The Law and the Prophets remained until John. Since then, the good news about the kingdom of God has been proclaimed, and everyone entering it is under attack.
42Lk 16:17 However, it is easier for heaven and earth to disappear than for one stroke of a letter in the Law to be dropped.
42Lk 16:18 Any man who divorces his wife and marries another woman commits adultery, and the man who marries a woman divorced from her husband commits adultery." 
42Lk 16:19 "Once there was a rich man who used to dress in purple and fine linen and live in great luxury every day.
42Lk 16:20 A beggar named Lazarus, who was covered with sores, was brought to his gate.
42Lk 16:21 He was always trying to satisfy his hunger with what fell from the rich man's table. Even the dogs used to come and lick his sores.
42Lk 16:22 "One day the beggar died and was carried away by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried.
42Lk 16:23 In the afterlife, where he was in constant torment, he looked up and saw Abraham far away and Lazarus by his side.
42Lk 16:24 So he shouted, 'Father Abraham, have mercy on me! Send Lazarus to dip the tip of his finger in water to cool off my tongue, because I am suffering in this fire.'16
42Lk 16:25 "But Abraham said, 'My child, remember that during your lifetime you received blessings, while Lazarus received hardships. But now he is being comforted here, while you suffer.
42Lk 16:26 Besides all this, a wide chasm has been fixed between us, so that those who want to cross from this side to you cannot do so, nor can they cross from your side to us.'
42Lk 16:27 "The rich man said, 'Then I beg you, father, send Lazarus to my father's house - 
42Lk 16:28 because I have five brothers - to warn them, so that they won't end up in this place of torture, too.'16
42Lk 16:29 "Abraham said, 'They have Moses and the Prophets. They should listen to them!'
42Lk 16:30 "But the rich man replied, 'No, father Abraham! But if someone from the dead went to them, they would repent.'
42Lk 16:31 "Then Abraham said to him, 'If your brothers do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be persuaded, even if someone were to rise from the dead.'" 
42Lk 17:1 Jesus said to his disciples, "It is inevitable that temptations to sin will come, but how terrible it will be for the person through whom they come!
42Lk 17:2 It would be better for him if a millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea than for him to cause one of these little ones to sin.
42Lk 17:3 "Watch yourselves! If your brother sins, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him.
42Lk 17:4 Even if he sins against you seven times in a day and comes back to you seven times and says, 'I repent,' you must forgive him."
42Lk 17:5 Then the apostles said to the Lord, "Give us more faith!"
42Lk 17:6 The Lord replied, "If you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you could say to this mulberry tree, 'Be uprooted and planted in the sea,' and it would obey you! 
42Lk 17:7 "Suppose a man among you has a servant plowing or watching sheep. Would he say to him when he comes in from the field, 'Come at once and have something to eat' - 
42Lk 17:8 Of course not. Instead, he would say to him, 'Get dinner ready for me, and put on your apron and wait on me until I eat and drink. Then you can eat and drink.'
42Lk 17:9 He doesn't praise the servant for doing what was commanded, does he - 
42Lk 17:10 That's the way it is with you. When you have done everything you were ordered to do, say, 'We are worthless servants. We have done only what we ought to have done.'"7
42Lk 17:11 One day, Jesus was traveling along the border between Samaria and Galilee on the way to Jerusalem.
42Lk 17:12 As he was going into a village, ten lepers met him. They stood at a distance
42Lk 17:13 and shouted, "Jesus, Master, have mercy on us!"
42Lk 17:14 When Jesus saw them, he told them, "Go and show yourselves to the priests." While they were going, they were made clean.
42Lk 17:15 But one of them, when he saw that he had been healed, came back and praised God with a loud voice.
42Lk 17:16 He fell on his face at Jesus' feet and thanked him. Now that man was a Samaritan.
42Lk 17:17 Jesus asked, "Ten men were made clean, weren't they? Where are the other nine - 
42Lk 17:18 Except for this foreigner, were any of them found to return and give praise to God?"
42Lk 17:19 Then he told the man, "Get up, and go home! Your faith has made you well."
42Lk 17:20 Once Jesus was asked by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God would come. He answered them, "The kingdom of God is not coming with a visible display.
42Lk 17:21 People won't be saying, 'Look! Here it is!' or 'There it is!' because now the kingdom of God is among you." 
42Lk 17:22 Then Jesus said to the disciples, "The time will come during which you will long to see one of these days when the Son of Man is with you, but you will not see it.
42Lk 17:23 People will say to you, 'Look! There he is!' or 'Look! Here he is!' But don't go and chase after him.
42Lk 17:24 Because just as lightning flashes and shines from one end of the sky to the other, so will the Son of Man be in his time.
42Lk 17:25 But first he must suffer a great deal and be rejected by those living today.
42Lk 17:26 "Just as it was in Noah's time, so it will be in the days of the Son of Man.
42Lk 17:27 People were eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage right up to the day when Noah went into the ark. Then the flood came and destroyed all of them.
42Lk 17:28 So it was in the days of Lot. People were eating and drinking, buying and selling, planting and building.
42Lk 17:29 But on the day when Lot left Sodom, fire and sulfur rained down from heaven and destroyed all of them.
42Lk 17:30 The day when the Son of Man is revealed will be like that. 
42Lk 17:31 "The person who is on the housetop that day must not come down to get his belongings out of his house. The person in the field, too, must not turn back to what's left behind.
42Lk 17:32 Remember Lot's wife!
42Lk 17:33 Whoever tries to save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life will preserve it.
42Lk 17:34 I tell you, two people will be in the same bed that night. One will be taken, and the other will be left behind.
42Lk 17:35 Two women will be grinding grain together. One will be taken, and the other will be left behind."
42Lk 17:36 ...
42Lk 17:37 Then they asked him, "Where, Lord, will this take place?" He told them, "Wherever there's a corpse, there the vultures will gather."
42Lk 18:1 Jesus told his disciples a parable about their need to pray all the time and never give up.
42Lk 18:2 He said, "In a city there was a judge who didn't fear God or respect people.
42Lk 18:3 In that city there was also a widow who kept coming to him and saying, 'Grant me justice against my adversary.'
42Lk 18:4 For a while the judge refused. But later he said to himself, 'I don't fear God or respect people,
42Lk 18:5 yet because this widow keeps bothering me, I will grant her justice. Otherwise, she will keep coming and wear me out.'" 
42Lk 18:6 Then the Lord added, "Listen to what the unrighteous judge says.
42Lk 18:7 Won't God grant his chosen people justice when they cry out to him day and night? Is he slow to help them - 
42Lk 18:8 I tell you, he will give them justice quickly. But when the Son of Man comes, will he find faith on earth?" 
42Lk 18:9 Jesus also told this parable to some people who trusted in themselves, thinking they were righteous, but who looked down on everyone else£º
42Lk 18:10 "Two men went up to the temple to pray. One was a Pharisee, and the other was a tax collector.
42Lk 18:11 The Pharisee stood by himself and prayed, 'O God, I thank you that I'm not like other people - thieves, dishonest people, adulterers, or even this tax collector.
42Lk 18:12 I fast twice a week, and I give a tenth of my entire income.'11
42Lk 18:13 "But the tax collector stood at a distance and would not even look up to heaven. Instead, he continued to beat his chest and said, 'O God, be merciful to me, the sinner that I am!'
42Lk 18:14 I tell you, this man, rather than the other one, went down to his home justified, because everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but the person who humbles himself will be exalted."13
42Lk 18:15 Now some people were even bringing their infants to Jesus to have him touch them. But when the disciples saw this, they sternly told the people not to do that.
42Lk 18:16 Jesus, however, called for the children and said, "Let the little children come to me, and stop keeping them away, because the kingdom of God belongs to people like these.
42Lk 18:17 I tell you with certainty, whoever doesn't receive the kingdom of God as a little child will never get into it at all." 
42Lk 18:18 Then an official asked Jesus, "Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life?" 
42Lk 18:19 "Why do you call me good?" Jesus asked him. "Nobody is good except for God.
42Lk 18:20 You know the commandments£º 'Never commit adultery. Never murder. Never steal. Never give false testimony. Honor your father and mother.'"
42Lk 18:21 The official replied, "I have kept all of these since I was a young man."
42Lk 18:22 When Jesus heard this, he said to him, "You still need to do one thing. Sell everything you have and give the money to the destitute, and you will have treasure in heaven. Then come back and follow me."
42Lk 18:23 But when the official heard this he became sad, because he was very rich.
42Lk 18:24 So when Jesus saw how sad he was, he said, "How hard it is for rich people to get into the kingdom of God!
42Lk 18:25 Indeed, it is easier for a camel to squeeze through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to get into the kingdom of God."
42Lk 18:26 Those who were listening to Jesus asked, "Then who can be saved?"
42Lk 18:27 Jesus replied, "The things that are impossible for people are possible for God." 
42Lk 18:28 Then Peter said, "See, we have left everything we have and followed you." 
42Lk 18:29 Jesus said to them, "I tell you with certainty, there is no one who has left his home, wife, brothers, parents, or children because of the kingdom of God
42Lk 18:30 who will not receive many times as much in this world, as well as eternal life in the age to come." 
42Lk 18:31 Jesus took his twelve disciples aside and said to them, "See, we are going up to Jerusalem. Everything written by the prophets about the Son of Man will be fulfilled.
42Lk 18:32 He will be handed over to the gentiles and will be mocked, insulted, and spit on.
42Lk 18:33 After they have whipped him, they will kill him, but on the third day he will rise again."
42Lk 18:34 But they didn't understand any of this. What he said was hidden from them, and they didn't know what he meant. 
42Lk 18:35 As Jesus was approaching Jericho, there was a blind man sitting by the road begging.
42Lk 18:36 When he heard the crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
42Lk 18:37 They told him that Jesus from Nazareth was coming by.
42Lk 18:38 So he shouted, "Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!"
42Lk 18:39 The people at the front of the crowd sternly told him to be quiet, but he started shouting even louder, "Son of David, have mercy on me!"18
42Lk 18:40 Then Jesus stopped and ordered the man to be brought to him. When he came near, Jesus asked him,
42Lk 18:41 "What do you want me to do for you?" He said, "Lord, I want to see again!"
42Lk 18:42 So Jesus told him, "See again! Your faith has made you well."
42Lk 18:43 Immediately the man could see again and began to follow Jesus, glorifying God. All the people saw this and gave praise to God. 
42Lk 19:1 As Jesus entered Jericho and was passing through it,
42Lk 19:2 a man named Zacchaeus appeared. He was a leading tax collector, and a rich one at that!
42Lk 19:3 He was trying to see who Jesus was, but he couldn't do so due to the crowd, since he was a short man.
42Lk 19:4 So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore tree to see Jesus, who was going to pass that way.
42Lk 19:5 When Jesus came to the tree, he looked up and said, "Zacchaeus, hurry and come down! I must stay at your house today."
42Lk 19:6 Zacchaeus came down quickly and was glad to welcome him into his home.5
42Lk 19:7 But all the people who saw this began to complain£º "Jesus is going to be the guest of a notorious sinner!"
42Lk 19:8 Later, Zacchaeus stood up and announced to the Lord, "Lord, I'll give half of my possessions to the poor. I'll pay four times as much as I owe if I have cheated anyone in any way." 
42Lk 19:9 Then Jesus said to him, "Today salvation has come to this home, because this man is also a descendant of Abraham,
42Lk 19:10 and the Son of Man has come to seek and to save the lost." 
42Lk 19:11 As they were listening to this, Jesus went on to tell a parable because he was near Jerusalem and because the people thought that the kingdom of God would appear immediately.
42Lk 19:12 So he said, "A prince went to a distant country to be appointed king and then to return.
42Lk 19:13 He called ten of his servants and gave them ten coins. He said to them, 'Invest this money until I come back.'
42Lk 19:14 But the citizens of his country hated him and sent a delegation to follow him and to announce, 'We don't want this man to rule over us!'
42Lk 19:15 "After he was appointed king, the prince came back. He ordered the servants to whom he had given the money to be called so he could find out what they had earned by investing.
42Lk 19:16 The first servant came and said, 'Sir, your coin has earned ten more coins.'
42Lk 19:17 The king said to him, 'Well done, good servant! Because you have been trustworthy in a very small thing, take charge of ten cities.' 
42Lk 19:18 "The second servant came and said, 'Your coin, sir, has earned five coins.'
42Lk 19:19 The king said to him, 'You take charge of five cities.'
42Lk 19:20 "Then the other servant came and said, 'Sir, look! Here's your coin. I've kept it in a cloth for safekeeping
42Lk 19:21 because I was afraid of you. You are a hard man. You withdraw what you didn't deposit and harvest what you didn't plant.'
42Lk 19:22 The king said to him, 'I will judge you by your own words, you evil servant! You knew, did you, that I was a hard man, and that I withdraw what I didn't deposit and harvest what I didn't plant - 
42Lk 19:23 Then why didn't you put my money in the bank? When I returned, I could have collected it with interest.'
42Lk 19:24 "So the king told those standing nearby, 'Take the coin away from him and give it to the man who has the ten coins.'
42Lk 19:25 They answered him, 'Sir, he already has ten coins!'
42Lk 19:26 'I tell you, to everyone who has something, more will be given, but from the person who has nothing, even what he has will be taken away.
42Lk 19:27 But as for these enemies of mine who didn't want me to be their king - bring them here and slaughter them in my presence!'"26
42Lk 19:28 After Jesus had said this, he traveled on and went up to Jerusalem.
42Lk 19:29 When he came near Bethphage and Bethany at the Mount of Olives, he sent two of his disciples on ahead
42Lk 19:30 and said, "Go into the village ahead of you. As you enter, you will find a colt tied up that no one has ever ridden. Untie it, and bring it along.
42Lk 19:31 If anyone asks you why you are untying it, say this£º 'The Lord needs it.'"
42Lk 19:32 So those who were sent went off and found it as Jesus had told them.
42Lk 19:33 While they were untying the colt, its owners asked them, "Why are you untying the colt?"
42Lk 19:34 The disciples answered, "The Lord needs it."
42Lk 19:35 Then they brought the colt to Jesus and put their coats on it, and Jesus sat upon it. 
42Lk 19:36 As he was riding along, people kept spreading their coats on the road.
42Lk 19:37 He was now approaching the descent from the Mount of Olives. The whole crowd of disciples began to rejoice and to praise God with a loud voice because of all the miracles they had seen.
42Lk 19:38 They said, "How blessed is the king who comes in the name of the Lord! Peace in heaven, and glory in the highest heaven!"
42Lk 19:39 Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to Jesus, "Teacher, tell your disciples to be quiet."
42Lk 19:40 He replied, "I tell you, if they were quiet, the stones would cry out!" 
42Lk 19:41 When he came closer and saw the city, he began to grieve over it£º
42Lk 19:42 "If you had only known today what could have brought you peace! But now it is hidden from your sight,
42Lk 19:43 because the days will come when your enemies will build walls around you, surround you, and close you in on every side.
42Lk 19:44 They will level you to the ground - you and those who live within your city limits. They will not leave one stone on another within your walls, because you didn't recognize the time when God came to help you."19
42Lk 19:45 Then Jesus went into the temple and began to throw out those who were selling things.
42Lk 19:46 He said to them, "It is written, 'My house is to be called a house of prayer,' but you have turned it into a hideout for bandits!" 
42Lk 19:47 Then he began teaching in the temple every day. The high priests, the scribes, and the leaders of the people kept looking for a way to kill him,
42Lk 19:48 but they couldn't find a way to do it, because all the people were eager to hear him.
42Lk 20:1 One day while Jesus was teaching the people in the temple and telling them the good news, the high priests and the scribes came with the elders
42Lk 20:2 and asked him, "Tell us£º By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority?" 
42Lk 20:3 He answered them, "I, too, will ask you a question. Tell me£º
42Lk 20:4 Was John's authority to baptize from heaven or from humans?"
42Lk 20:5 They discussed this among themselves£º "If we say, 'From heaven,' he will ask, 'Then why didn't you believe him?'
42Lk 20:6 But if we say, 'From humans,' all the people will stone us to death, because they are convinced that John was a prophet."
42Lk 20:7 So they answered that they didn't know where it was from.6
42Lk 20:8 Then Jesus told them, "Then I won't tell you by what authority I am doing these things."
42Lk 20:9 Then he began to tell the people this parable£º "A man planted a vineyard, leased it to tenant farmers, and went abroad for a long time.
42Lk 20:10 At the right time he sent a servant to the farmers in order to get his share of the produce of the vineyard. But the farmers beat him and sent him back empty-handed.
42Lk 20:11 He sent another servant, and they beat him, too, treated him shamefully, and sent him back empty-handed.
42Lk 20:12 Then he sent a third, and they wounded him and threw him out, too.11
42Lk 20:13 "Then the owner of the vineyard said, 'What should I do? I'll send my son whom I love. Maybe they'll respect him.'
42Lk 20:14 But when the farmers saw him, they talked it over among themselves and said, 'This is the heir. Let's kill him so that the inheritance will be ours!'
42Lk 20:15 So they threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. Now what will the owner of the vineyard do to them - 
42Lk 20:16 He will come and destroy those farmers and give the vineyard to others." Those who heard him said, "That must never happen!"
42Lk 20:17 But Jesus looked at them and asked, "What does this text mean£º 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone' - 
42Lk 20:18 Everyone who falls on that stone will be broken to pieces, and it will crush anyone on whom it falls." 
42Lk 20:19 When the scribes and the high priests realized that Jesus had told this parable about them, they wanted to arrest him right then, but they were afraid of the crowd.
42Lk 20:20 So they watched him closely and sent spies who pretended to be honest men in order to trap him in what he would say. They wanted to hand him over to the jurisdiction of the governor.
42Lk 20:21 So they asked him, "Teacher, we know that you are right in what you say and teach, and that you don't favor any individual, but teach the way of God truthfully.
42Lk 20:22 Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar or not?"
42Lk 20:23 But he discerned their craftiness and responded to them,
42Lk 20:24 "Show me a denarius. Whose face and name does it have?" "Caesar's," they replied.
42Lk 20:25 So he said to them, "Then give back to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's."
42Lk 20:26 So they couldn't catch him before the people in what he said. Amazed at his answer, they became silent.
42Lk 20:27 Now some Sadducees, who claim there is no resurrection, came to Jesus
42Lk 20:28 and asked him, "Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife but no child, the man should marry the widow and have children for his brother.
42Lk 20:29 Now there were seven brothers. The first one married and died childless.
42Lk 20:30 Then the second
42Lk 20:31 and the third married her. In the same way, all seven died and left no children.
42Lk 20:32 Finally, the woman died, too.
42Lk 20:33 Now in the resurrection, whose wife will the woman be, since the seven had married her?"
42Lk 20:34 Jesus said to them, "Those who belong to this age marry and are married,
42Lk 20:35 but those who are considered worthy of a place in that age and in the resurrection from the dead neither marry nor are given in marriage.
42Lk 20:36 Nor can they die anymore, because they are like the angels and, since they share in the resurrection, are God's children.
42Lk 20:37 Even Moses demonstrated in the story about the bush that the dead are raised, when he calls the Lord 'the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.'
42Lk 20:38 He is not the God of the dead, but of the living, because he considers all people to be alive to him."36
42Lk 20:39 Then some of the scribes replied, "Teacher, you have given a fine answer."
42Lk 20:40 Then they no longer dared to ask him another question.
42Lk 20:41 Then he asked them, "How can people say that the Messiah is David's son - 
42Lk 20:42 Because David himself in the book of Psalms says, 'The Lord said to my Lord, "Sit at my right hand,
42Lk 20:43 until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet."'
42Lk 20:44 So David calls him 'Lord.' Then how can he be his son?"
42Lk 20:45 While all the people were listening, he said to his disciples,
42Lk 20:46 "Beware of the scribes! They like to walk around in long robes and love to be greeted in the marketplaces and to have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at banquets.
42Lk 20:47 They devour widows' houses and say long prayers to cover it up. They will receive greater condemnation!"20
42Lk 21:1 Now Jesus looked up and saw rich people dropping their gifts into the offering box.
42Lk 21:2 Then he saw a destitute widow drop in two small copper coins.
42Lk 21:3 He said, "I tell you with certainty, this destitute widow has dropped in more than all of them,
42Lk 21:4 because all the others contributed to the offering out of their surplus, but she, in her poverty, dropped in everything she had to live on."
42Lk 21:5 Now while some people were talking about the temple - how it was decorated with beautiful stones and gifts dedicated to God - he said,
42Lk 21:6 "As for these things that you see, the time will come when not one stone will be left on another that will not be knocked down." 
42Lk 21:7 Then they asked him, "Teacher, when will these things take place, and what will be the sign that these things are about to take place?"
42Lk 21:8 He said, "Be careful that you are not deceived, because many will come in my name and say, 'I AM' and 'The time has come.' Don't follow them.
42Lk 21:9 When you hear of wars and revolutions, never be alarmed, because these sort of things must take place first, but the end won't come right away."
42Lk 21:10 Then he went on to say to them, "Nation will rise up in arms against nation, and kingdom against kingdom.
42Lk 21:11 There will be great earthquakes and famines and plagues in various places, and there will be fearful events and awful signs from heaven.
42Lk 21:12 "But before all these things take place, people will arrest you and persecute you. They will hand you over to synagogues and prisons, and you will be brought before kings and governors for my name's sake.
42Lk 21:13 It will give you an opportunity to testify.
42Lk 21:14 So purpose in your hearts not to prepare your defense ahead of time,
42Lk 21:15 because I will give you the ability to speak, along with wisdom, that none of your opponents will be able to resist or refute.
42Lk 21:16 "You will be betrayed even by parents, brothers, relatives, and friends, and they will put some of you to death.
42Lk 21:17 You will be hated continuously by everyone because of my name.
42Lk 21:18 And yet not a hair on your head will be lost.
42Lk 21:19 By your endurance you will protect your lives."
42Lk 21:20 "When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then understand that its devastation is approaching.
42Lk 21:21 Then those in Judea must flee to the mountains, those inside the city must leave it, and those in the countryside must not go into it,
42Lk 21:22 because these are the days of vengeance when all that is written will be fulfilled. 
42Lk 21:23 "How terrible it will be for those women who are pregnant or who are nursing babies in those days! Because there will be great distress in the land and wrath against this people.
42Lk 21:24 They will fall by the edge of the sword and be carried off as captives among all the nations, and Jerusalem will be trampled on by the gentiles until the times of the gentiles are fulfilled."
42Lk 21:25 "There will be signs in the sun, the moon, and the stars, and there will be distress on earth among the nations that are confused by the roaring of the sea and its waves.
42Lk 21:26 People will faint from fear and apprehension because of the things that are to come on the inhabited world, because the powers of heaven will be shaken.
42Lk 21:27 Then they will see 'the Son of Man coming in a cloud' with power and great glory.
42Lk 21:28 "Now when these things begin to take place, stand up and lift up your heads, because your deliverance is approaching."21
42Lk 21:29 Then he told them a parable£º "Look at the fig tree and all the trees.
42Lk 21:30 As soon as they produce leaves, you can see for yourselves and know that summer is already near.
42Lk 21:31 In the same way, when you see these things taking place, you will know that the kingdom of God is near.
42Lk 21:32 "I tell you with certainty, this generation will not disappear until all these things take place.
42Lk 21:33 Heaven and earth will disappear, but my words will never disappear." 
42Lk 21:34 "Constantly be on your guard so that your hearts will not be loaded down with self-indulgence, drunkenness, and the worries of this life, or that day will take you by surprise
42Lk 21:35 like a trap, because it will come on everyone who lives on the face of the earth.
42Lk 21:36 So be alert at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place and to take your stand in the presence of the Son of Man." 
42Lk 21:37 Now during the day Jesus would teach in the temple, but when evening came he would go out and spend the night on what is called the Mount of Olives.
42Lk 21:38 And all the people would get up early in the morning to listen to him in the temple.
42Lk 22:1 Now the Festival of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was near.
42Lk 22:2 So the high priests and the scribes were looking for a way to put him to death, because they were afraid of the crowd. 
42Lk 22:3 But Satan went into Judas called Iscariot, who belonged to the circle of the twelve disciples.
42Lk 22:4 So he went off and discussed with the high priests and the temple police how he could betray Jesus to them.
42Lk 22:5 They were delighted, and agreed to give him money.
42Lk 22:6 Judas accepted their offer and began to look for a good opportunity to betray Jesus to them when no crowd was present.
42Lk 22:7 Then the day of the Festival of Unleavened Bread came, on which the Passover lamb was to be sacrificed.
42Lk 22:8 So Jesus sent Peter and John, saying, "Go and make preparations for us to eat the Passover meal."
42Lk 22:9 They asked him, "Where do you want us to prepare it?"
42Lk 22:10 He said to them, "Just after you go into the city, a man carrying a jug of water will meet you. Follow him into the house he enters
42Lk 22:11 and say to the owner of the house, 'The Teacher asks you, "Where is the room where I can eat the Passover meal with my disciples?"'
42Lk 22:12 Then he will show you a large upstairs room that is furnished. Get things ready for us there."
42Lk 22:13 So they went and found everything just as Jesus had told them, and they prepared the Passover meal.
42Lk 22:14 Now when the hour came, Jesus took his place at the table, along with his apostles.
42Lk 22:15 He said to them, "I have eagerly desired to eat this Passover meal with you before I suffer,
42Lk 22:16 because I tell you, I will never eat it again until it finds its fulfillment in the kingdom of God." 
42Lk 22:17 Then he took a cup, gave thanks, and said, "Take this and share it among yourselves,
42Lk 22:18 because I tell you, from now on I will never drink the product of the vine until the kingdom of God comes." 
42Lk 22:19 Then he took a loaf of bread, gave thanks, broke it in pieces, and handed it to them, saying, "This is my body, which is given for you. Keep on doing this in memory of me." 
42Lk 22:20 He did the same with the cup after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant sealed by my blood, which is being poured out for you.
42Lk 22:21 Yet look! The hand of the man who is betraying me is with me on the table!
42Lk 22:22 The Son of Man is going away, just as it has been determined, but how terrible it will be for that man by whom he is betrayed!"
42Lk 22:23 Then they began to discuss among themselves which one of them was going to do this.
42Lk 22:24 Now an argument sprang up among them as to which one of them was to be regarded as the greatest.
42Lk 22:25 But he said to them, "The kings of the gentiles lord it over them, and those who exercise authority over them are called benefactors.
42Lk 22:26 But you are not to do so. On the contrary, the greatest among you should become like the youngest, and the one who leads should become like the one who serves.
42Lk 22:27 Because who is greater, the one who sits at the table, or the one who serves? It is the one at the table, isn't it? But I am among you as one who serves. 
42Lk 22:28 "You are the ones who have always stood by me in my trials.
42Lk 22:29 And I confer a kingdom on you, just as my Father has conferred a kingdom on me,
42Lk 22:30 so that you may eat and drink at my table in my kingdom and sit down on thrones to govern the twelve tribes of Israel." 
42Lk 22:31 "Simon, Simon, listen! Satan has asked permission to sift all of you like wheat,
42Lk 22:32 but I have prayed for you that your own faith may not fail. When you have come back, you must strengthen your brothers."31
42Lk 22:33 Peter said to him, "Lord, I am ready even to go to prison and to die with you!"
42Lk 22:34 But Jesus said, "I tell you, Peter, the rooster will not crow today until you deny three times that you know me." 
42Lk 22:35 Then Jesus asked his disciples, "When I sent you out without a wallet, traveling bag, or sandals, you didn't lack anything, did you?" They replied, "Nothing at all." 
42Lk 22:36 Then he said to them, "But now whoever has a wallet must take it along, and his traveling bag, too. And the one who has no sword must sell his coat and buy one.
42Lk 22:37 Because I tell you, what has been written about me must be fulfilled£º 'He was counted among the criminals.' Indeed, what is written about me must be fulfilled."36
42Lk 22:38 So they said, "Lord, look! Here are two swords." He answered them, "Enough of that!"
42Lk 22:39 Then he left and went to the Mount of Olives, as usual. The disciples went with him.
42Lk 22:40 When he arrived, he said to them, "Keep on praying that you may not be tempted."
42Lk 22:41 Then he withdrew from them about a stone's throw, knelt down, and began to pray,
42Lk 22:42 "Father, if you are willing, take this cup away from me. Yet not my will but yours be done." 
42Lk 22:43 Then an angel from heaven appeared to him and strengthened him.
42Lk 22:44 In his anguish he prayed more earnestly, and his sweat became like large drops of blood falling on the ground.
42Lk 22:45 When he got up from prayer, he went to the disciples and found them asleep from sorrow.
42Lk 22:46 He asked them, "Why are you sleeping? Get up and keep on praying that you may not be tempted." 
42Lk 22:47 While Jesus was still speaking, a crowd arrived. The man called Judas, one of the twelve disciples, was leading them, and he came close to Jesus to kiss him.
42Lk 22:48 But Jesus asked him, "Judas, are you betraying the Son of Man with a kiss?"
42Lk 22:49 When those who were around Jesus saw what was about to take place, they asked, "Lord, should we attack with our swords?"
42Lk 22:50 Then one of them struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. 
42Lk 22:51 But Jesus said, "No more of this!" So he touched the wounded man's ear and healed him.
42Lk 22:52 Then Jesus said to the high priests, the temple police, and the elders, who had come for him, "Have you come out with swords and clubs as if I were a bandit - 
42Lk 22:53 While I was with you day after day in the temple, you didn't lay a hand on me. But this is your hour, when darkness reigns!"
42Lk 22:54 Then they arrested him, led him away, and brought him to the high priest's house. But Peter was following at a distance.
42Lk 22:55 When they had kindled a fire in the middle of the courtyard and had taken their seats, Peter, too, sat down among them.
42Lk 22:56 A servant girl saw him sitting by the fire, stared at him, and said, "This man was with him, too."
42Lk 22:57 But he denied it, saying, "I don't know him, woman!"
42Lk 22:58 A little later a man looked at him and said, "You are one of them, too." But Peter said, "Mister, I am not!" 
42Lk 22:59 About an hour later another man emphatically asserted, "This man was certainly with him, because he is a Galilean!" 
42Lk 22:60 But Peter said, "Mister, I don't know what you're talking about!" Just then, while he was still speaking, a rooster crowed.
42Lk 22:61 Then the Lord turned and looked at Peter. And Peter remembered the word from the Lord, and how he had said to him, "Before a rooster crows today, you will deny me three times."
42Lk 22:62 So he went outside and cried bitterly.
42Lk 22:63 Then the men who were holding Jesus in custody began to make fun of him while they beat him.
42Lk 22:64 They blindfolded him and asked him over and over again, "Prophesy! Who is the one who hit you?"
42Lk 22:65 And they kept insulting him in many other ways.
42Lk 22:66 As soon as day came, the elders of the people, the high priests, and the scribes assembled and brought him before their Council.
42Lk 22:67 They said, "If you are the Messiah, tell us."But he said to them, "If I tell you, you won't believe me,
42Lk 22:68 and if I ask you a question, you won't answer me.
42Lk 22:69 But from now on the Son of Man will be seated at the right hand of the mighty God."22
42Lk 22:70 Then they all asked, "Are you, then, the Son of God?"He answered them, "You said it, I AM."
42Lk 22:71 "Why do we need any more testimony?" they asked. "We have heard it ourselves from his own mouth!"22
42Lk 23:1 Then the whole crowd got up and took him to Pilate.
42Lk 23:2 They began to accuse him, "We found this man corrupting our nation, forbidding us to pay taxes to Caesar, and saying that he is the Messiah, a king."
42Lk 23:3 Then Pilate asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" He answered, "You say so."
42Lk 23:4 Then Pilate said to the high priests and crowds, "I do not find anything chargeable in this man."
42Lk 23:5 But they kept insisting, "He is stirring up the people with what he teaches all over Judea, from where he started in Galilee to this place."
42Lk 23:6 When Pilate heard this, he asked whether the man was a Galilean.
42Lk 23:7 When he learned with certainty that Jesus came from Herod's jurisdiction, he sent him off to Herod, who was in Jerusalem at that time. 
42Lk 23:8 Now Herod was very glad to see Jesus, because he had been wanting to see him for a long time on account of what he had heard about him. He was also hoping to see some sign done by him.
42Lk 23:9 So he continued to question him for a long time, but Jesus gave him no answer at all.
42Lk 23:10 Meanwhile, the high priests and the scribes stood nearby and continued to accuse him vehemently.
42Lk 23:11 Even Herod and his soldiers treated him with contempt and made fun of him. He put a magnificent robe on Jesus and sent him back to Pilate.
42Lk 23:12 So Herod and Pilate became friends with each other that very day. Before this they had been enemies. 
42Lk 23:13 Then Pilate called the high priests, the other leaders, and the people together
42Lk 23:14 and said to them, "You brought this man to me as one who turns the people against the government. And here in your presence I have examined him and have found him "Not Guilty" of the charges you make against him.
42Lk 23:15 Nor does Herod, because he sent him back to us. Indeed, this man has done nothing to deserve death.
42Lk 23:16 So I will punish him and let him go."
42Lk 23:17 Now he was obligated to release someone for them at the festival.
42Lk 23:18 But they all shouted out together, "Away with this man! Release Barabbas for us!"
42Lk 23:19 (This man had been put in prison for murder and for a revolt that had taken place in the city.)
42Lk 23:20 But Pilate wanted to let Jesus go, so he appealed to them again,
42Lk 23:21 but they continued to shout, "Crucify him! Crucify him!"
42Lk 23:22 Then he spoke to them a third time£º "What has he done wrong? I have found nothing in him worthy of death. So I will punish him and let him go."
42Lk 23:23 But they kept pressing him with loud shouts, demanding that Jesus be crucified, and their shouts began to prevail.
42Lk 23:24 Then Pilate pronounced his sentence that their demand should be carried out.
42Lk 23:25 So he released the man who had been put in prison for revolt and murder - the man whose release they continued to demand - but he let them have their way with Jesus.
42Lk 23:26 As they led Jesus away, they grabbed Simon, a man from Cyrene, as he was coming in from the country, and they put the cross on him and made him carry it behind Jesus.
42Lk 23:27 A large crowd of people followed him, including some women who kept mourning and wailing for him.
42Lk 23:28 But Jesus turned to them and said, "Women of Jerusalem, stop crying for me. Instead, cry for yourselves and for your children,
42Lk 23:29 because the time is surely coming when people will say, 'How blessed are the women who couldn't bear children and the wombs that never bore and the breasts that never nursed!'
42Lk 23:30 Then people will begin to say to the mountains, 'Fall on us!', and to the hills, 'Cover us up!'
42Lk 23:31 And if they do this when the wood is green, what will happen when it is dry?" 
42Lk 23:32 Two others, who were criminals, were also led away to be executed with Jesus.
42Lk 23:33 When they reached the place called The Skull, they crucified him there with the criminals, one on his right and one on his left.
42Lk 23:34 Jesus kept saying, "Father, forgive them, because they don't know what they're doing." Then they divided his clothes among them by throwing dice. 
42Lk 23:35 Meanwhile, the people stood looking on. The leaders were mocking him by saying, "He saved others. Let him save himself, if he is the Messiah of God, the chosen one!"
42Lk 23:36 The soldiers also made fun of Jesus by coming up and offering him sour wine,
42Lk 23:37 saying, "If you are the king of the Jews, save yourself!"
42Lk 23:38 There was also an inscription over him written in Greek, Latin, and Hebrew£º "This is the King of the Jews." 
42Lk 23:39 Now one of the criminals hanging there kept insulting him, "You are the Messiah, aren't you? Save yourself and us!"23
42Lk 23:40 But the other criminal rebuked him, "Aren't you afraid of God, since you are suffering the same penalty - 
42Lk 23:41 We have been condemned justly, because we are getting what we deserve for what we have done, but this man has done nothing wrong."
42Lk 23:42 Then he went on to plead, "Jesus, remember me when you come into your kingdom!"
42Lk 23:43 Jesus said to him, "I tell you with certainty, today you will be with me in Paradise."
42Lk 23:44 It was already about noon, and the whole land became dark until three in the afternoon
42Lk 23:45 because the sun had stopped shining. And the curtain in the sanctuary was torn in two.
42Lk 23:46 Then Jesus cried out with a loud voice and said, "Father, into your hands I entrust my spirit." After he said this, he breathed his last. 
42Lk 23:47 When the centurion saw what had taken place, he praised God and said, "This man certainly was righteous!"
42Lk 23:48 When all the crowds who had come together for this spectacle saw what had taken place, they beat their chests and left.
42Lk 23:49 But all his acquaintances, including the women who had followed him from Galilee, were standing at a distance watching these things. 
42Lk 23:50 Now there was a man named Joseph, a member of the Council, a good and righteous man - 
42Lk 23:51 he had not voted for their plan and action - from the Jewish town of Arimathea; and he was waiting for the kingdom of God.
42Lk 23:52 He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus.
42Lk 23:53 Then he took it down, wrapped it in a linen cloth, and laid it in a tomb cut in the rock, in which no one had yet been laid. 
42Lk 23:54 It was the Preparation Day, and the Sabbath was just beginning.
42Lk 23:55 So the women who had come with Jesus from Galilee, following close behind, saw the tomb and how his body was laid.
42Lk 23:56 Then they went back and prepared spices and perfumes, and on the Sabbath they rested according to the commandment. 
42Lk 24:1 But at early dawn on the first day of the week, they went to the tomb, taking the spices they had prepared.
42Lk 24:2 They found the stone rolled away from the tomb,
42Lk 24:3 but when they went in, they didn't find the body of the Lord Jesus.2
42Lk 24:4 While they were puzzling over this, two men in dazzling robes suddenly stood beside them.
42Lk 24:5 While the women remained terrified, bowing their faces to the ground, the men asked them, "Why are you looking among the dead for someone who is living - 
42Lk 24:6 He is not here but has been raised. Remember what he told you while he was still in Galilee,
42Lk 24:7 'the Son of Man must be handed over to sinful men, be crucified, and rise on the third day.'"
42Lk 24:8 Then the women remembered Jesus' words.
42Lk 24:9 They returned from the tomb and reported all these things to the eleven disciples and all the others.
42Lk 24:10 The women who told the apostles about it were Mary Magdalene, Joanna, Mary the mother of James, and some others.
42Lk 24:11 But what they said seemed nonsense to them, so they did not believe them.
42Lk 24:12 Peter, however, got up and ran to the tomb. He stooped down and saw only the linen cloths. Then he went home wondering about what had happened.
42Lk 24:13 On the same day, two of Jesus' followers were walking to a village called Emmaus, about seven miles from Jerusalem.
42Lk 24:14 They were talking with each other about all these things that had taken place.
42Lk 24:15 While they were discussing and analyzing what had happened, Jesus himself approached and began to walk with them,
42Lk 24:16 but their eyes were prevented from recognizing him.
42Lk 24:17 He asked them, "What are you discussing with each other as you're walking along?" They stood still and looked gloomy. 
42Lk 24:18 The one whose name was Cleopas answered him, "Are you the only visitor to Jerusalem who doesn't know what happened there in the past few days?" 
42Lk 24:19 He asked them, "What things?" They answered him, "The events involving Jesus of Nazareth, who was a prophet, mighty in what he said and did before God and all the people,
42Lk 24:20 and how our high priests and leaders handed him over to be condemned to death and had him crucified.
42Lk 24:21 But we kept hoping that he would be the one to redeem Israel. What is more, this is now the third day since these things occurred.
42Lk 24:22 Even some of our women have startled us by what they told us. They were at the tomb early this morning
42Lk 24:23 and didn't find his body there, so they came back and told us that they had seen a vision of angels, who were saying that he was alive.
42Lk 24:24 Then some of those who were with us went to the tomb and found it just as the women had said. However, they didn't see him."20
42Lk 24:25 Then Jesus said to them, "O, how foolish you are! How slow you are to believe everything the prophets said!
42Lk 24:26 The Messiah had to suffer these things and then enter his glory, didn't he?"
42Lk 24:27 Then, beginning with Moses and all the Prophets, he explained to them all the passages of Scripture about himself. 
42Lk 24:28 As they came near the village where the two men were headed, Jesus acted as though he were going farther.
42Lk 24:29 But they strongly urged him, "Stay with us, because it is almost evening and the daylight is nearly gone." So he went in to stay with them.
42Lk 24:30 While he was at the table with them, he took the bread, blessed it, broke it in pieces, and gave it to them.
42Lk 24:31 Then their eyes were opened, and they knew who he was. And he vanished from them.
42Lk 24:32 Then they asked each other, "Our hearts kept burning within us as he was talking to us on the road and explaining the Scriptures to us, didn't they?"
42Lk 24:33 They got up right away, went back to Jerusalem, and found the eleven disciples and their companions all together.
42Lk 24:34 They kept saying, "The Lord has really risen and has appeared to Simon!"
42Lk 24:35 Then the two men began to tell what had happened on the road and how they had recognized him when he broke the bread in pieces.
42Lk 24:36 While they were all talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, "Peace be with you."
42Lk 24:37 They were startled and terrified, thinking they were seeing a ghost.
42Lk 24:38 But Jesus said to them, "What's frightening you? And why are you doubting - 
42Lk 24:39 Look at my hands and my feet, because it's really me. Touch me and look at me, because a ghost doesn't have flesh and bones as you see that I have." 
42Lk 24:40 After he had said this, he showed them his hands and his feet.
42Lk 24:41 Even though they were still skeptical due to their joy and astonishment, Jesus asked them, "Do you have anything here to eat?"
42Lk 24:42 They gave him a piece of broiled fish,
42Lk 24:43 and he took it and ate it in their presence.
42Lk 24:44 Then he said to them, "These are the words that I spoke to you while I was still with you - that everything written about me in the law of Moses, the Prophets, and the Psalms had to be fulfilled."
42Lk 24:45 Then he opened their minds so that they might understand the Scriptures.
42Lk 24:46 He said to them, "This is how it is written£º the Messiah was to suffer and rise from the dead on the third day,
42Lk 24:47 and then repentance and forgiveness of sins is to be proclaimed in his name to all the nations, beginning at Jerusalem.
42Lk 24:48 You are witnesses of these things.
42Lk 24:49 I am sending to you what my Father promised, so stay here in the city until you have been clothed with power from on high."47
42Lk 24:50 Later, he led them out as far as Bethany, lifted up his hands, and blessed them.
42Lk 24:51 While he was blessing them, he left them and was taken up to heaven.
42Lk 24:52 They worshiped him and returned to Jerusalem filled with great joy.
42Lk 24:53 They were continually in the temple, blessing God.
43
43Jn 1:1 In the beginning, the Word existed. The Word was with God, and the Word was God.
43Jn 1:2 He existed in the beginning with God.
43Jn 1:3 Through him all things were made, and apart from him nothing was made that has been made.
43Jn 1:4 In him was life, and that life brought light to humanity. 
43Jn 1:5 And the light shines on in the darkness, and the darkness has never put it out.
43Jn 1:6 There was a man sent from God, whose name was John.
43Jn 1:7 He came as a witness to testify about the light, so that all might believe because of him.
43Jn 1:8 John was not the light, but he came to testify about the light.
43Jn 1:9 This was the true light that enlightens every person by his coming into the world.
43Jn 1:10 He was in the world, and the world was made through him. Yet the world did not recognize him.
43Jn 1:11 He came to his own creation, yet his own people did not receive him.
43Jn 1:12 However, to all who received him, those believing in his name, he gave authority to become God's children,
43Jn 1:13 who were born, not merely in a genetic sense, nor from lust, nor from man's desire, but from the will of God.
43Jn 1:14 The Word became flesh and lived among us. We gazed on his glory, the kind of glory that belongs to the Father's unique Son, who is full of grace and truth.
43Jn 1:15 John told the truth about him when he cried out, "This is the person about whom I said, 'The one who comes after me ranks higher than me, because he existed before me.'"
43Jn 1:16 We have all received one gracious gift after another from his abundance,
43Jn 1:17 because while the Law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus the Messiah.
43Jn 1:18 No one has ever seen God. The unique God, who is close to the Father's side, has revealed him. 
43Jn 1:19 This was John's testimony when the Jews sent priests and Levites to him from Jerusalem to ask him, "Who are you?" 
43Jn 1:20 He spoke openly and, remaining true to himself, admitted, "I am not the Messiah."
43Jn 1:21 So they asked him, "Well then, are you Elijah?" John said, "I am not." "Are you the Prophet?" He answered, "No."
43Jn 1:22 "Who are you?" they asked him. "We must give an answer to those who sent us. What do you say about yourself?"
43Jn 1:23 He replied, "I am '¡¦a voice crying out in the wilderness, "Prepare the Lord's highway,"' as the prophet Isaiah said."
43Jn 1:24 Now those men had been sent from the Pharisees.
43Jn 1:25 They asked him, "Why, then, are you baptizing if you are not the Messiah, or Elijah, or the Prophet?"
43Jn 1:26 John answered them, "I am baptizing with water, but among you stands a man whom you do not know,
43Jn 1:27 the one who is coming after me, whose sandal straps I am not worthy to untie."
43Jn 1:28 This happened in Bethany on the other side of the Jordan, where John was baptizing. 
43Jn 1:29 The next day John saw Jesus coming toward him and said, "Look, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
43Jn 1:30 This is the one about whom I said, 'After me comes a man who ranks above me, because he existed before me.'
43Jn 1:31 I didn't recognize him, but I came baptizing with water so that he might be revealed to Israel." 
43Jn 1:32 John also testified, "I saw the Spirit coming down from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him.
43Jn 1:33 I didn't recognize him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water told me, 'The person on whom you see the Spirit descending and remaining is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.'
43Jn 1:34 I have seen this and have testified that this is the Son of God."
43Jn 1:35 The next day John was standing there again with two of his disciples.
43Jn 1:36 As he watched Jesus walk by, he said, "Look, the Lamb of God!"
43Jn 1:37 When the two disciples heard him say this, they followed Jesus.
43Jn 1:38 But when Jesus turned around and saw them following, he asked them, "What are you looking for?" They asked him, "Rabbi," (which is translated "Teacher"), "where are you staying?"
43Jn 1:39 He told them, "Come and see!" So they went and saw where he was staying, and they remained with him that day. It was about four o'clock in the afternoon.
43Jn 1:40 Andrew, Simon Peter's brother, was one of the two who heard John and followed Jesus.
43Jn 1:41 The first thing Andrew did was to find his brother Simon and say to him, "We have found the Messiah!" (which is translated "Christ").
43Jn 1:42 He led Simon to Jesus. Jesus looked at him intently and said, "You are Simon, John's son. You will be called Cephas!" (which is translated "Peter").
43Jn 1:43 The next day Jesus decided to go away to Galilee, where he found Philip and said to him, "Follow me."
43Jn 1:44 Now Philip was from Bethsaida, the hometown of Andrew and Peter.1
43Jn 1:45 Philip found Nathaniel and told him, "We have found the man about whom Moses in the Law and the Prophets wrote - Jesus, the son of Joseph, from Nazareth."
43Jn 1:46 Nathaniel asked him, "Out of Nazareth? Can anything good come from there?" Philip told him, "Come and see!"
43Jn 1:47 Jesus saw Nathaniel coming toward him and said about him, "Look, a genuine Israelite, in whom there is no deceit!" 
43Jn 1:48 Nathaniel asked him, "How do you know me?"Jesus answered him, "Before Philip called you, while you were under the fig tree, I saw you."
43Jn 1:49 Nathaniel replied to him, "Rabbi, you are the Son of God! You are the King of Israel!" 
43Jn 1:50 Jesus said to him, "Do you believe because I told you that I saw you under the fig tree? You will see greater things than that."
43Jn 1:51 Then he said to him, "Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, you will see heaven standing open and the angels of God going up and coming down to the Son of Man." 
43Jn 2:1 On the third day of that week there was a wedding in Cana of Galilee. Jesus' mother was there,
43Jn 2:2 and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding.
43Jn 2:3 When the wine ran out, Jesus' mother said to him, "They don't have any more wine."
43Jn 2:4 "How does that concern us, dear lady?" Jesus asked her. "My time hasn't come yet." 
43Jn 2:5 His mother told the servants, "Do whatever he tells you."
43Jn 2:6 Now standing there were six stone water jars used for the Jewish rites of purification, each one holding from20 to30 gallons.
43Jn 2:7 Jesus told the servants, "Fill the jars with water." So they filled them up to the brim.
43Jn 2:8 Then he said to them, "Now draw some out and take it to the man in charge of the banquet." So they did.7
43Jn 2:9 When the man in charge of the banquet tasted the water that had become wine (without knowing where it had come from, though the servants who had drawn the water knew), he called for the bridegroom
43Jn 2:10 and said to him, "Everyone serves the best wine first, and the cheap kind when people are drunk. But you have kept the best wine until now!"
43Jn 2:11 Jesus did this, the first of his signs, in Cana of Galilee. He revealed his glory, and his disciples believed in him. 
43Jn 2:12 After this, Jesus went down to Capernaum - he, his mother, his brothers, and his disciples - and they remained there for a few days. 
43Jn 2:13 The Jewish Passover was near, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
43Jn 2:14 In the temple he found people selling cattle, sheep, and doves, as well as moneychangers sitting at their tables.
43Jn 2:15 After making a whip out of cords, he drove all of them out of the temple, including the sheep and the cattle. He scattered the coins of the moneychangers and knocked over their tables.
43Jn 2:16 Then he told those who were selling the doves, "Take these things out of here! Stop making my Father's house a marketplace!"
43Jn 2:17 His disciples remembered that it was written, "Zeal for your house will consume me."
43Jn 2:18 Then the Jews asked him, "What sign can you show us as authority for doing these things?" 
43Jn 2:19 Jesus answered them, "Destroy this sanctuary, and in three days I will rebuild it." 
43Jn 2:20 The Jews said, "This sanctuary has been under construction for46 years, and you're going to rebuild it in three days?"
43Jn 2:21 But the sanctuary he was speaking about was his own body.
43Jn 2:22 After he had been raised from the dead, his disciples remembered that he had said this. So they believed the Scripture and the statement that Jesus had made.
43Jn 2:23 While Jesus was in Jerusalem for the Passover Festival, many people believed in him because they saw the signs that he was doing.
43Jn 2:24 Jesus, however, did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people
43Jn 2:25 and didn't need anyone to tell him what people were like, because he himself knew what was in every person.2
43Jn 3:1 Now there was a man from the Pharisees, a leader of the Jews, whose name was Nicodemus.
43Jn 3:2 He came to Jesus at night and said to him, "Rabbi, we know that you have come from God as a teacher, because no one can perform these signs that you are doing unless God is with him." 
43Jn 3:3 Jesus replied to him, "Truly, I tell you with certainty, unless a person is born from above he cannot see the kingdom of God." 
43Jn 3:4 Nicodemus asked him, "How can a person be born when he is old? He can't go back into his mother's womb a second time and be born, can he?"
43Jn 3:5 Jesus answered, "Truly, I tell you with certainty, unless a person is born of water and Spirit he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
43Jn 3:6 What is born of the flesh is flesh, and what is born of the Spirit is spirit.
43Jn 3:7 Don't be astonished that I said to you, 'All of you must be born from above.'
43Jn 3:8 The wind blows where it wants to. You hear its sound, but you don't know where it comes from or where it is going. That's the way it is with everyone who is born of the Spirit." 
43Jn 3:9 Nicodemus asked him, "How can that be?" 
43Jn 3:10 Jesus answered him, "You're a teacher of Israel, and you can't understand this - 
43Jn 3:11 Truly, I tell you with certainty, we know what we're talking about, and we testify about what we've seen. Yet you people do not accept our testimony.
43Jn 3:12 If I have told you people about earthly things and you do not believe, how will you believe if I tell you about heavenly things - 
43Jn 3:13 "No one has gone up to heaven except the one who came down from heaven, the Son of Man who is in heaven.
43Jn 3:14 Just as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,
43Jn 3:15 so that everyone who believes in him may have eternal life.
43Jn 3:16 "For this is how God loved the world£º He gave his unique Son so that everyone who believes in him might not be lost but have eternal life.
43Jn 3:17 Because God sent the Son into the world, not to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through him.
43Jn 3:18 Whoever believes in him is not condemned, but whoever does not believe has already been condemned, because he has not believed in the name of God's unique Son.
43Jn 3:19 And this is the basis for judgment£º The light has come into the world, but people loved the darkness more than the light because their actions were evil.
43Jn 3:20 Everyone who practices wickedness hates the light and does not come to the light, so that his actions may not be exposed.
43Jn 3:21 But whoever does what is true comes to the light, so that it may become evident that his actions have God's approval."20
43Jn 3:22 After this, Jesus and his disciples went into the Judean countryside. He spent some time there with them and began baptizing.
43Jn 3:23 John was also baptizing in Aenon, near Salim, because there was plenty of water there. People kept coming and were being baptized,
43Jn 3:24 since John had not yet been thrown into prison. 
43Jn 3:25 Then a controversy about ritual purification sprang up between a certain Jew and John's disciples,
43Jn 3:26 so they went to John and told him, "Rabbi, the man who was with you on the other side of the Jordan, the one about whom you testified - look, he's baptizing, and everyone is going to him!" 
43Jn 3:27 John replied, "No one can receive anything unless it has been given to them from heaven.
43Jn 3:28 You yourselves are my witnesses that I said, 'I am not the Messiah, but I have been sent ahead of him.'
43Jn 3:29 It is the bridegroom who gets the bride, yet the bridegroom's friend, who merely stands by and listens for him, is overjoyed to hear the bridegroom's voice. That's why this joy of mine is now complete.
43Jn 3:30 He must become more important, but I must become less important."3
43Jn 3:31 The one who comes from above is superior to everything. The one who is of the earth belongs to the earth and speaks about earthly things. The one who comes from heaven is superior to everything.
43Jn 3:32 He testifies about what he has seen and heard, yet no one accepts his testimony.
43Jn 3:33 The person who has accepted his testimony has acknowledged that God is truthful.
43Jn 3:34 The one whom God sent speaks the words of God, because God does not give the Spirit in limited measure to him.
43Jn 3:35 The Father loves the Son and has put everything in his hands.
43Jn 3:36 The one who believes in the Son has eternal life, but the one who disobeys the Son will not see life. Instead, the wrath of God remains on him. 
43Jn 4:1 Now when Jesus realized that the Pharisees had heard he was making and baptizing more disciples than John - 
43Jn 4:2 although it was not Jesus who did the baptizing but his disciples - 
43Jn 4:3 he left Judea and went back to Galilee.
43Jn 4:4 Now it was necessary for him to go through Samaria.
43Jn 4:5 So he came to a town in Samaria called Sychar, near the piece of land that Jacob had given to his son Joseph.
43Jn 4:6 Jacob's Well was also there, and Jesus, tired out by the journey, sat down by the well. It was about noon.
43Jn 4:7 A Samaritan woman came to draw water, and Jesus said to her, "Please give me a drink,"
43Jn 4:8 since his disciples had gone off into town to buy food.
43Jn 4:9 The Samaritan woman asked him, "How can you, a Jew, ask for a drink from me, a Samaritan woman?" Because Jews do not have anything to do with Samaritans.
43Jn 4:10 Jesus answered her, "If you knew the gift of God, and who it is who is saying to you, 'Please give me a drink,' you would have been the one to ask him, and he would have given you living water." 
43Jn 4:11 The woman said to him, "Sir, you don't have a bucket, and the well is deep. Where are you going to get this living water - 
43Jn 4:12 You're not greater than our ancestor Jacob, who gave us the well and drank from it, along with his sons and his flocks, are you?"
43Jn 4:13 Jesus answered her, "Everyone who drinks this water will become thirsty again.
43Jn 4:14 But whoever drinks the water that I will give him will never become thirsty again. The water that I will give him will become a well of water for him, springing up to eternal life." 
43Jn 4:15 The woman said to him, "Sir, give me this water, so that I won't get thirsty or have to keep coming here to draw water." 
43Jn 4:16 He said to her, "Go and call your husband, and come back here."
43Jn 4:17 The woman answered him, "I don't have a husband." Jesus said to her, "You are quite right in saying, 'I don't have a husband,'
43Jn 4:18 because you have had five husbands, and the man you have now is not your husband. What you have said is true."
43Jn 4:19 The woman said to him, "Sir, I see that you are a prophet!
43Jn 4:20 Our ancestors worshiped on this mountain. But you Jews say that the place where people should worship is in Jerusalem." 
43Jn 4:21 Jesus said to her, "Believe me, dear lady, the hour is coming when you Samaritans will worship the Father neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem.
43Jn 4:22 You don't know what you're worshiping. We Jews know what we're worshiping, because salvation comes from the Jews.
43Jn 4:23 Yet the time is coming, and is now here, when true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and truth. Indeed, the Father is looking for people like that to worship him.
43Jn 4:24 God is spirit, and those who worship him must worship in spirit and truth."
43Jn 4:25 The woman said to him, "I know that Messiah is coming, who is being called 'Christ'. When that person comes, he will explain everything."
43Jn 4:26 "I am he," Jesus replied, "the one who is speaking to you." 
43Jn 4:27 At this point his disciples arrived, and they were amazed that he was talking to a woman. Yet no one said, "What do you want from her?" or, "Why are you talking to her?"
43Jn 4:28 Then the woman left her water jar and went back to town. She told people,
43Jn 4:29 "Come, see a man who told me everything I've ever done! Could he possibly be the Messiah?"
43Jn 4:30 The people left the town and started on their way to him.
43Jn 4:31 Meanwhile, the disciples were urging him, "Rabbi, have something to eat."
43Jn 4:32 But he said to them, "I have food to eat that you know nothing about."
43Jn 4:33 So the disciples began to say to one another, "No one has brought him anything to eat, have they?"
43Jn 4:34 Jesus told them, "My food is doing the will of the one who sent me and completing his work.
43Jn 4:35 You say, don't you, 'In four more months the harvest will begin?' Look, I tell you, open your eyes and observe that the fields are ready for harvesting now!
43Jn 4:36 The one who harvests is already receiving his wages and gathering a crop for eternal life, so that the one who sows and the one who harvests may rejoice together.
43Jn 4:37 In this respect the saying is true£º 'One person sows, and another person harvests.'
43Jn 4:38 I have sent you to harvest what you have not worked for. Others have worked, and you have adopted their work as your own."
43Jn 4:39 Now many of the Samaritans of that town believed in Jesus because the woman had testified, "He told me everything I've ever done."
43Jn 4:40 So when the Samaritans came to Jesus, they asked him to stay with them, and he stayed there for two days.
43Jn 4:41 And many more believed because of what he said.
43Jn 4:42 They kept telling the woman, "It is no longer because of what you said that we believe, because now we have heard him ourselves, and we know that he really is the Savior of the world." 
43Jn 4:43 Two days later, Jesus left for Galilee from there,
43Jn 4:44 since Jesus himself had testified that a prophet has no honor in his own country.
43Jn 4:45 When he arrived in Galilee, the Galileans welcomed him because they had seen everything that he had done in Jerusalem during the festival and because they, too, had gone to the festival.
43Jn 4:46 So Jesus returned to Cana in Galilee, where he had turned the water into wine. Meanwhile, in Capernaum there was a government official whose son was ill.
43Jn 4:47 When this man heard that Jesus had come from Judea to Galilee, he went to him and asked him repeatedly to come down and heal his son, because he was about to die.
43Jn 4:48 Jesus told him, "Unless you people see signs and wonders, you will never believe." 
43Jn 4:49 The official said to him, "Sir, please come down before my little boy dies."
43Jn 4:50 Jesus said to him, "Go home. Your son will live." The man believed what Jesus told him and started back home.
43Jn 4:51 While he was on his way, his servants met him and told him that his child was alive.
43Jn 4:52 So he asked them at what hour he had begun to recover, and they told him, "The fever left him yesterday at one o'clock in the afternoon."
43Jn 4:53 Then the father realized that this was the very hour when Jesus had told him, "Your son will live." So he himself believed, along with his whole family.4
43Jn 4:54 Now this was the second sign that Jesus did after coming from Judea to Galilee.
43Jn 5:1 Later on, there was another festival of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem.
43Jn 5:2 Near the Sheep Gate in Jerusalem is a pool called Bethesda in Hebrew. It has five colonnades,
43Jn 5:3 and under these a large number of sick people were lying - blind, lame, or paralyzed - waiting for the movement of the water.
43Jn 5:4 At certain times an angel of the Lord would go down into the pool and stir up the water, and whoever stepped in first after the stirring of the water was healed of whatever disease he had.2
43Jn 5:5 One particular man was there who had been ill for38 years.
43Jn 5:6 When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time, he asked him, "Do you want to get well?"
43Jn 5:7 The sick man answered him, "Sir, I don't have anyone to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. While I'm trying to get there, someone else steps down ahead of me."
43Jn 5:8 Jesus said to him, "Stand up, pick up your mat, and walk!"
43Jn 5:9 The man immediately became well, and he picked up his mat and started walking. Now that day was a Sabbath. 
43Jn 5:10 So the Jews said to the man who had been healed, "It is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to carry your mat." 
43Jn 5:11 But he answered them, "The man who made me well told me, 'Pick up your mat and walk.'"
43Jn 5:12 They asked him, "Who is the man who told you, 'Pick it up and walk'?"
43Jn 5:13 But the one who had been healed did not know who it was, because Jesus had slipped away from the crowd in that place.
43Jn 5:14 Later on, Jesus found him in the temple and told him, "See, you have become well. Stop sinning or something worse may happen to you."
43Jn 5:15 The man went off and told the Jews that it was Jesus who had made him well.
43Jn 5:16 So the Jews began persecuting Jesus, because he kept doing such things on the Sabbath.
43Jn 5:17 But Jesus answered them, "My Father has been working until now, and I, too, am working."
43Jn 5:18 So the Jews were trying all the harder to kill him, because he was not only breaking the Sabbath but was also calling God his own Father, thereby making himself equal to God. 
43Jn 5:19 Jesus said to them, "Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, the Son can do nothing on his own accord, but only what he sees the Father doing, What the Father does, the Son does likewise.
43Jn 5:20 The Father loves the Son and shows him everything he is doing, and he will show him even greater actions than these, so that you may be amazed.
43Jn 5:21 Just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to those he chooses.
43Jn 5:22 The Father judges no one, but has given all authority to judge to the Son,
43Jn 5:23 so that everyone may honor the Son as they honor the Father. Whoever does not honor the Son does not honor the Father who sent him. 
43Jn 5:24 "Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, whoever hears what I say and believes in the one who sent me has eternal life and will not be judged, but has passed from death to life.
43Jn 5:25 Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, the time approaches, and is now here, when the dead will hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear it will live.
43Jn 5:26 Just as the Father has life in himself, so also he has granted the Son to have life in himself,
43Jn 5:27 and he has given him authority to judge, because he is the Son of Man.
43Jn 5:28 Don't be amazed at this, because the time is approaching when everyone in their graves will hear the Son of Man's voice
43Jn 5:29 and will come out - those who have done what is good to the resurrection that leads to life, and those who have practiced what is evil to the resurrection that ends in condemnation.
43Jn 5:30 I can do nothing on my own accord. I judge according to what I hear, and my judgment is just, because I do not seek my own will but the will of the one who sent me."
43Jn 5:31 "If I testify on my own behalf, my testimony is not trustworthy.
43Jn 5:32 There is another who testifies about me, and I know that the testimony he gives about me is true.
43Jn 5:33 You have sent messengers to John, and he has testified to the truth.
43Jn 5:34 I myself do not accept human testimony, but I am saying these things so that you may be saved.
43Jn 5:35 That man John was a lamp that burns and brightly shines, and for a while you were willing to rejoice in his light.534
43Jn 5:36 But I have a greater testimony than John's, because the actions that the Father has given me to complete - the very actions that I am doing - testify on my behalf that the Father has sent me.
43Jn 5:37 Moreover, the Father who sent me has himself testified on my behalf. You have never heard his voice or seen what he looks like,
43Jn 5:38 nor do you have his word at work in you, because you do not believe in the one whom he sent.
43Jn 5:39 You examine the Scriptures carefully because you suppose that in them you have eternal life. Yet they testify about me.
43Jn 5:40 But you are not willing to come to me to have life. 
43Jn 5:41 "I do not accept human praise.
43Jn 5:42 I know that you do not have the love of God in you.
43Jn 5:43 I have come in my Father's name, and you do not accept me. Yet if another man comes in his own name, you will accept him.
43Jn 5:44 How can you believe when you accept each other's praise and do not look for the praise that comes from the only God - 
43Jn 5:45 Do not suppose that I will be the one to accuse you before the Father. Your accuser is Moses, on whom you have set your hope,
43Jn 5:46 because if you believed Moses, you would believe me, since he wrote about me.
43Jn 5:47 But if you do not believe what he wrote, how will you believe my words?"
43Jn 6:1 After this, Jesus went away to the other side of the Sea of Galilee (or Tiberias).
43Jn 6:2 A large crowd kept following him because they had seen the signs that he was performing by healing the sick.
43Jn 6:3 But Jesus went up on a hillside and sat down there with his disciples.
43Jn 6:4 Now the Passover, the festival of the Jews, was near.
43Jn 6:5 When Jesus looked up and saw that a large crowd was coming toward him, he asked Philip, "Where can we buy bread for these people to eat?"
43Jn 6:6 Jesus said this to test him, because he himself knew what he was going to do.
43Jn 6:7 Philip answered him, "Two hundred denarii worth of bread isn't enough for each of them to have a little."
43Jn 6:8 One of his disciples, Andrew, who was Simon Peter's brother, said to him,
43Jn 6:9 "There's a little boy here who has five barley loaves and two small fish. But what are these among so many people?" 
43Jn 6:10 Jesus said, "Have the people sit down." Now there was plenty of grass in that area, so they sat down, numbering about 5,000 men.
43Jn 6:11 Then Jesus took the loaves, gave thanks, and distributed them to those who were seated. He also distributed as much fish as they wanted.
43Jn 6:12 When they were completely satisfied, Jesus told his disciples, "Collect the pieces that are left over so that nothing is wasted."
43Jn 6:13 So they collected and filled twelve baskets full of pieces of the five barley loaves left over by those who had eaten.
43Jn 6:14 When the people saw the sign that he had done, they kept saying, "Truly this is the Prophet who was to come into the world!"
43Jn 6:15 Then Jesus, realizing that they were about to come and take him by force to make him king, withdrew again to the hillside by himself.
43Jn 6:16 When evening came, his disciples went down to the sea,
43Jn 6:17 got into a boat, and started across the sea to Capernaum. Darkness had already fallen, and Jesus had not yet come to them.
43Jn 6:18 A strong wind was blowing, and the sea was getting rough.
43Jn 6:19 After they had rowed about three or four miles, they saw Jesus walking on the sea toward their boat. They became terrified.
43Jn 6:20 But he said to them, "It is I. Stop being afraid!"
43Jn 6:21 So they were glad to take him on board, and immediately the boat reached the land toward which they were going.20
43Jn 6:22 The next day, the crowd that had remained on the other side of the sea noticed that only one boat had been there, and no other, and that Jesus had not gotten into that boat with his disciples. Instead, his disciples had gone away by themselves.
43Jn 6:23 Other small boats from Tiberias arrived near the place where they had eaten the bread after the Lord had given thanks.
43Jn 6:24 When the crowd saw that neither Jesus nor his disciples were there, they got into these boats and went to Capernaum to look for Jesus.
43Jn 6:25 When they had found him on the other side of the sea, they asked him, "Rabbi, when did you get here?"
43Jn 6:26 Jesus replied to them, "Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, you are looking for me, not because you saw signs, but because you ate the loaves and were completely satisfied.
43Jn 6:27 Do not work for food that perishes but for food that lasts for eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you, because God the Father has set his seal on him." 
43Jn 6:28 Then they asked him, "What must we do to perform the actions of God?"
43Jn 6:29 Jesus answered them, "This is the action of God£º to believe in the one whom he has sent."
43Jn 6:30 So they asked him, "What sign are you going to do so that we may see it and believe in you? What actions are you performing - 
43Jn 6:31 Our ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness, just as it is written, 'He gave them bread from heaven to eat.'"
43Jn 6:32 Jesus said to them, "Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, it was not Moses who gave you the bread from heaven, but it is my Father who gives you the true bread from heaven.
43Jn 6:33 The bread of God is the one who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world."
43Jn 6:34 Then they said to him, "Sir, give us this bread all the time." 
43Jn 6:35 Jesus said to them, "I am the bread of life. Whoever comes to me will never become hungry, and whoever believes in me will never become thirsty.
43Jn 6:36 I told you that you have seen me, yet you don't believe.
43Jn 6:37 Everything the Father gives me will come to me, and I'll never turn away the one who comes to me.
43Jn 6:38 I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of the one who sent me.
43Jn 6:39 And this is the will of the one who sent me, that I should not lose anything that he has given me, but should raise it to life on the last day.
43Jn 6:40 This is my Father's will£º That everyone who sees the Son and believes in him should have eternal life, and I will raise him to life on the last day." 
43Jn 6:41 Then the Jews began grumbling about him because he said, "I am the bread that came down from heaven."
43Jn 6:42 They kept saying, "This is Jesus, the son of Joseph, isn't it, whose father and mother we know? So how can he say, 'I have come down from heaven'?" 
43Jn 6:43 Jesus answered them, "Stop grumbling among yourselves.
43Jn 6:44 No one can come to me unless the Father who sent me draws him, and I will raise him to life on the last day.
43Jn 6:45 It is written in the Prophets, 'And all of them will be taught by God.' Everyone who has listened to the Father and has learned anything comes to me.
43Jn 6:46 Not that anyone has seen the Father except the one who comes from God. This one has seen the Father.
43Jn 6:47 Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, the one who believes in me has eternal life.
43Jn 6:48 I am the bread of life.
43Jn 6:49 Your ancestors ate the manna in the wilderness and died.
43Jn 6:50 This is the bread that comes down from heaven, so that a person may eat it and not die.
43Jn 6:51 I am the living bread that came down from heaven. If anyone eats this bread, he will live forever. And the bread I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."46
43Jn 6:52 Then the Jews debated angrily with each other, asking, "How can this man give us his flesh to eat?" 
43Jn 6:53 So Jesus told them, "Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood, you do not have life in yourselves.
43Jn 6:54 Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood has eternal life, and I will raise him to life on the last day,
43Jn 6:55 because my flesh is real food, and my blood is real drink.
43Jn 6:56 The person who eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him.
43Jn 6:57 Just as the living Father sent me and I live because of the Father, so the one who feeds on me will also live because of me.
43Jn 6:58 This is the bread that came down from heaven, not the kind that your ancestors ate. They died, but the one who eats this bread will live forever."
43Jn 6:59 He said this while teaching in the synagogue at Capernaum.57
43Jn 6:60 When many of his disciples heard this, they said, "This is a difficult statement. Who can accept it?"
43Jn 6:61 But Jesus, knowing within himself that his disciples were grumbling about this, asked them, "Does this offend you - 
43Jn 6:62 What if you saw the Son of Man going up to the place where he was before - 
43Jn 6:63 It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh accomplishes nothing. The words that I have spoken to you are spirit and life.
43Jn 6:64 But there are some among you who do not believe..." - because Jesus knew from the beginning those who weren't believing, as well as the one who would betray him.
43Jn 6:65 So he said, "That's why I told you that no one can come to me unless it be granted him by the Father."
43Jn 6:66 As a result, many of his disciples turned back and no longer associated with him. 
43Jn 6:67 So Jesus asked the twelve disciples, "You don't want to leave, too, do you?"
43Jn 6:68 Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom would we go? You have the words of eternal life.
43Jn 6:69 Besides, we have believed and remain convinced that you are the Holy One of God."
43Jn 6:70 Jesus answered them, "I chose you twelve men, didn't I? Yet one of you is a devil."
43Jn 6:71 Now he was speaking about Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, because this man was going to betray him, even though he was one of the twelve disciples.
43Jn 7:1 After this, Jesus traveled about in Galilee, because he didn't want to travel in Judea, since the Jews there were trying to kill him.
43Jn 7:2 Now the Jewish Festival of Tabernacles was approaching.
43Jn 7:3 So his brothers said to him, "You should leave this place and go to Judea, so that your disciples can see the actions that you're doing,
43Jn 7:4 since no one acts in secret if he wants to be known publicly. If you're going to do these things, you should reveal yourself to the world!"
43Jn 7:5 Not even his brothers believed in him.
43Jn 7:6 Jesus told them, "My time has not yet come, but your time is always here.
43Jn 7:7 The world cannot hate you, but it hates me because I testify against it that its actions are evil.
43Jn 7:8 Go up to the festival yourselves. I am not yet going to this festival, because my time has not yet fully come."
43Jn 7:9 After saying this, he remained in Galilee.
43Jn 7:10 But after his brothers had gone up to the festival, he went up himself, not openly but, as it were, in secret.
43Jn 7:11 The Jews kept looking for him at the festival, asking, "Where is that man?"
43Jn 7:12 And there was a great deal of discussion about him among the crowds. Some were saying, "He is a good man," while others were saying, "No, he is deceiving the crowds!"
43Jn 7:13 Nevertheless, no one would speak openly about him because they were afraid of the Jewish leaders.
43Jn 7:14 Halfway through the festival, Jesus went up to the temple and began teaching.
43Jn 7:15 The Jewish leaders were astonished and remarked, "How can this man be so educated when he has never gone to school?" 
43Jn 7:16 Jesus replied to them, "My teaching is not mine but comes from the one who sent me.
43Jn 7:17 If anyone wants to do his will, he will know whether this teaching is from God or whether I am speaking on my own.
43Jn 7:18 The one who speaks on his own seeks his own praise. But the one who seeks the praise of him who sent him is genuine, and there is nothing false in him.
43Jn 7:19 Moses gave you the law, didn't he? Yet none of you is keeping the law. Why are you trying to kill me?" 
43Jn 7:20 The crowd answered, "You have a demon! Who is trying to kill you?" 
43Jn 7:21 Jesus answered them, "I performed one action, and all of you are astonished.
43Jn 7:22 Moses gave you circumcision - not that it is from Moses, but from the Patriarchs - and so you circumcise a man on the Sabbath.
43Jn 7:23 If a man receives circumcision on the Sabbath so that the law of Moses may not be broken, are you angry with me because I made a man perfectly well on the Sabbath - 
43Jn 7:24 Stop judging by appearances, but judge with righteous judgment!"22
43Jn 7:25 Then some of the people of Jerusalem began saying, "This is the man they are trying to kill, isn't it - 
43Jn 7:26 And look, he is speaking in public, and they are not saying anything to him! Can it be that the authorities really know that this is the Messiah?
43Jn 7:27 We know where this man comes from. But when the Messiah comes, no one will know where he comes from." 
43Jn 7:28 At this point Jesus, still teaching in the temple, shouted, "So you know me and know where I have come from? I have not come on my own accord. But the one who sent me is true, and he is the one you do not know.
43Jn 7:29 I know him because I have come from him and he sent me." 
43Jn 7:30 Then they tried to seize him, but no one laid a hand on him because his hour had not yet come.
43Jn 7:31 However, many in the crowd believed in him, saying, "When the Messiah comes, he won't do more signs than this man has done, will he?" 
43Jn 7:32 The Pharisees heard the crowd debating these things about him, so the high priests and the Pharisees sent officers to arrest Jesus.
43Jn 7:33 Then Jesus said, "I will be with you only a little while longer, and then I am going back to the one who sent me.
43Jn 7:34 You will look for me but will not find me. And where I am, you cannot come." 
43Jn 7:35 Then the Jewish leaders asked one another, "Where does this man intend to go that we won't be able to find him? Surely he's not going to the Dispersion among the Greeks and teach the Greeks, is he - 
43Jn 7:36 What does this statement mean that he said, 'You will look for me but will not find me,' and 'Where I will be, you cannot come'?"
43Jn 7:37 On the last and most important day of the festival, Jesus stood up and shouted, "If anyone is thirsty, let him come to me and drink!
43Jn 7:38 The one who believes in me, as the Scripture has said, will have rivers of living water flowing from his heart."
43Jn 7:39 Now he said this about the Spirit, whom those who were believing in him were to receive, because the Spirit was not yet present and Jesus had not yet been glorified. 
43Jn 7:40 When they heard these words, some in the crowd were saying, "This really is the Prophet,"
43Jn 7:41 while others were saying, "This is the Messiah!" But some were saying, "The Messiah doesn't come from Galilee, does he - 
43Jn 7:42 Doesn't the Scripture say that the Messiah is from David's family and from Bethlehem, the village where David lived?"
43Jn 7:43 So there was a division in the crowd because of him.
43Jn 7:44 Some of them were wanting to seize him, but no one laid hands on him. 
43Jn 7:45 Then the officers returned to the high priests and Pharisees, who asked them, "Why didn't you bring him?"
43Jn 7:46 The officers answered, "No man ever spoke like that!" 
43Jn 7:47 Then the Pharisees replied to them, "You haven't been deceived, too, have you - 
43Jn 7:48 None of the authorities or Pharisees has believed in him, have they - 
43Jn 7:49 But this mob that does not know the law - they're under a curse!"
43Jn 7:50 One of their own, Nicodemus (the man who had previously met with Jesus), asked them,
43Jn 7:51 "Surely our law does not condemn a person without first hearing from him and finding out what he is doing, does it?" 
43Jn 7:52 They answered him, "You aren't from Galilee, too, are you? Search and see that no prophet comes from Galilee."
43Jn 7:53 Then each of them went to their own home.
43Jn 8:1 Jesus, however, went to the Mount of Olives.
43Jn 8:2 At daybreak he appeared again in the temple, and all the people came to him. So he sat down and began to teach them.
43Jn 8:3 But the scribes and the Pharisees brought a woman who had been caught in adultery. After setting her before them,
43Jn 8:4 they said to him, "Teacher, this woman has been caught in the very act of adultery.
43Jn 8:5 Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such women to death. What do you say?"
43Jn 8:6 They said this to test him, so that they might have a charge against him. But Jesus bent down and began to write on the ground with his finger.2
43Jn 8:7 When they persisted in questioning him, he straightened up and said to them, "Let the person among you who is without sin be the first to throw a stone at her."
43Jn 8:8 Then he bent down again and continued writing on the ground.
43Jn 8:9 When they heard this, they went away one by one, beginning with the oldest, and he was left alone with the woman standing there.
43Jn 8:10 Then Jesus stood up and asked her, "Dear lady, where are your accusers? Hasn't anyone condemned you - 9
43Jn 8:11 "No one, sir," she replied. Then Jesus said, "I don't condemn you, either. Go home, and from now on do not sin any more."
43Jn 8:12 Later on Jesus spoke to them again, saying, "I am the light of the world. The one who follows me will never walk in darkness, but will have the light of life." 
43Jn 8:13 The Pharisees said to him, "You are testifying about yourself. Your testimony is not valid."
43Jn 8:14 Jesus answered them, "Even though I am testifying about myself, my testimony is valid because I know where I have come from and where I am going. But you do not know where I come from or where I am going.
43Jn 8:15 You are judging by human standards, but I am not judging anyone.
43Jn 8:16 Yet even if I should judge, my judgment would be valid, because it is not I alone who judges, but I and the one who sent me.
43Jn 8:17 In your own law it is written that the testimony of two people is valid.
43Jn 8:18 I am testifying about myself, and the Father who sent me is testifying about me." 
43Jn 8:19 Then they asked him, "Where is this Father of yours?"Jesus replied, "You do not know me or my Father. If you had known me, you would have known my Father also."
43Jn 8:20 He spoke these words in the treasury, while he was teaching in the temple. Yet no one arrested him, because his hour had not yet come. 
43Jn 8:21 Later on he said to them again, "I am going away, and you will look for me, but you will die in your sin. You cannot come where I am going." 
43Jn 8:22 So the Jews were asking, "He isn't going to kill himself, is he? Is that why he said, 'You cannot come where I am going'?"
43Jn 8:23 He said to them, "You are from below, I am from above. You are of this world, but I am not of this world.
43Jn 8:24 That is why I told you that you will die in your sins, for unless you believe that I AM, you will die in your sins."
43Jn 8:25 Then they asked him, "Who are you?" Jesus told them, "What have I been telling you all along - 
43Jn 8:26 I have much to say about you and to condemn you for. But the one who sent me is truthful, and what I have heard from him I declare to the world." 
43Jn 8:27 They didn't realize that he was talking to them about the Father.
43Jn 8:28 So Jesus told them, "When you have lifted up the Son of Man, then you will know that I AM, and that I do nothing on my own authority. Instead, I speak only what the Father has taught me.
43Jn 8:29 Moreover, the one who sent me is with me. He has never left me alone because I always do what pleases him."
43Jn 8:30 While he was saying these things, many believed in him.29
43Jn 8:31 So Jesus said to those Jews who had believed in him, "If you continue in my word, you are really my disciples.
43Jn 8:32 And you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free." 
43Jn 8:33 They replied to him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have never been slaves to anybody. So how can you say, 'You will be set free'?" 
43Jn 8:34 Jesus answered them, "Truly, I tell all of you with certainty that everyone who commits sin is a slave of sin.
43Jn 8:35 The slave does not remain in the household forever, but the son does remain forever.
43Jn 8:36 So if the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed!" 
43Jn 8:37 "I know that you are Abraham's descendants. Yet you are trying to kill me because you've not received what I've told you.
43Jn 8:38 I declare what I have seen in my Father's presence, and you are doing what you have heard from your father." 
43Jn 8:39 They replied to him, "Our father is Abraham!"Jesus said to them, "If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing what Abraham did.
43Jn 8:40 But now you are trying to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God. Abraham would not have done that.
43Jn 8:41 You are doing your father's actions." They said to him, "We are not illegitimate children. We have one Father, God himself."
43Jn 8:42 Jesus told them, "If God were your Father, you would have loved me, because I came from God and am here. I have not come on my own accord, but he sent me.
43Jn 8:43 Why don't you understand what I've said? It's because you can't listen to my words.
43Jn 8:44 You belong to your father the devil, and you want to carry out the desires of your father. He was a murderer from the beginning and has never stood for truth, since there is no truth in him. Whenever he tells a lie he speaks in character, because he is a liar and the father of lies.
43Jn 8:45 But it is because I speak the truth that you do not believe me.
43Jn 8:46 Can any of you prove me guilty of sin? If I am telling the truth, why don't you believe me - 
43Jn 8:47 The one who belongs to God listens to the words of God. The reason you do not listen is because you do not belong to God."45
43Jn 8:48 The Jews replied to him, "Surely we are right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon, aren't we?"8
43Jn 8:49 Jesus answered, "I don't have a demon. On the contrary, I honor my Father, and you dishonor me.
43Jn 8:50 I don't seek my own glory. There is one who seeks it, and he is the Judge.
43Jn 8:51 Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, if anyone keeps my word, he will never see death."8
43Jn 8:52 Then the Jews said to him, "Now we really know that you have a demon. Abraham died, and so did the prophets, but you say, 'If anyone keeps my word, he will never taste death.'
43Jn 8:53 You aren't greater than our father Abraham, who died, are you? The prophets also died. Who are you making yourself out to be?"
43Jn 8:54 Jesus answered, "If I were trying to glorify myself, my glory would mean nothing. It is my Father who glorifies me, of whom you say, 'He is our God.'
43Jn 8:55 You don't know him, but I know him. If I were to say that I don't know him, I would be a liar like you. But I do know him and keep his word.
43Jn 8:56 Your father Abraham rejoiced that he would see my day, and he saw it and was glad." 
43Jn 8:57 Then the Jews asked him, "You are not even 50 years old, yet you have seen Abraham?"
43Jn 8:58 Jesus said to them, "Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, before there was an Abraham, I AM!"
43Jn 8:59 At this, they picked up stones to throw at him, but Jesus hid himself and went out of the temple. 
43Jn 9:1 As he was walking along, he observed a man who had been blind from birth.
43Jn 9:2 His disciples asked him, "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that caused him to be born blind?" 
43Jn 9:3 Jesus answered, "Neither this man nor his parents sinned. This happened so that God's work might be revealed in him.
43Jn 9:4 I must do the work of the one who sent me while it is day. Night is approaching, when no one can work.
43Jn 9:5 As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world."
43Jn 9:6 After saying this, he spit on the ground and made mud with the saliva. Then he spread the mud on the man's eyes
43Jn 9:7 and told him, "Go and wash in the pool of Siloam" (which is translated "Sent One"). So he went off, washed, and came back seeing.4
43Jn 9:8 Then the neighbors and those who had previously seen him as a beggar said, "This is the man who used to sit and beg, isn't it?"
43Jn 9:9 Some were saying, "It's him," while others were saying, "No, but it's someone like him." He himself kept saying, "It's me!"
43Jn 9:10 So they asked him, "How, then, did you gain your eyesight?"
43Jn 9:11 He said, "The man named Jesus made some mud, spread it on my eyes, and told me, 'Go to Siloam and wash.' So off I went and washed, and I received my sight." 
43Jn 9:12 They asked him, "Where is that man?" He said, "I don't know!"
43Jn 9:13 So they brought to the Pharisees the man who had once been blind.
43Jn 9:14 Now it was a Sabbath day when Jesus made the mud and healed his eyes.
43Jn 9:15 So the Pharisees also began to ask him how he had gained his sight. He told them, "He put mud on my eyes, then I washed, and now I can see."
43Jn 9:16 Some of the Pharisees began to remark, "This man is not from God because he does not keep the Sabbath." But others were saying, "How can a sinful man perform such signs?" And there was a division among them. 
43Jn 9:17 So they asked the formerly blind man again, "What do you say about him, since it was your eyes he healed?" He said, "He is a prophet." 
43Jn 9:18 The Jews did not believe that the man had been blind and had gained sight until they summoned his parents
43Jn 9:19 and asked them, "Is this your son, the one you say was born blind? How does he now see?"
43Jn 9:20 His parents replied, "We know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
43Jn 9:21 But we don't know how it is that he now sees, and we don't know who opened his eyes. Ask him. He is of age and can speak for himself."
43Jn 9:22 His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews, since the Jews had already agreed that anyone who acknowledged that Jesus was the Messiah would be thrown out of the synagogue.
43Jn 9:23 That's why his parents said, "He is of age. Ask him."
43Jn 9:24 The Jewish leaders summoned the man who had been blind a second time and told him, "Give glory to God! We know that this man is a sinner." 
43Jn 9:25 But he responded, "I don't know whether he is a sinner or not. The one thing I do know is that I used to be blind and now I can see!"
43Jn 9:26 Then they asked him, "What did he do to you? How did he heal your eyes?"
43Jn 9:27 He answered them, "I've already told you, but you didn't listen. Why do you want to hear it again? You don't want to become his disciples, too, do you?"
43Jn 9:28 At this, they turned on him in fury and said, "You are his disciple, but we are disciples of Moses!
43Jn 9:29 We know that God has spoken to Moses, but we do not know where this fellow comes from." 
43Jn 9:30 The man answered them, "This is an amazing thing! You don't know where he comes from, yet he healed my eyes.
43Jn 9:31 We know that God doesn't listen to sinners, but he does listen to anyone who worships him and does his will.
43Jn 9:32 Ever since creation it has never been heard that anyone healed the eyes of a man who was born blind.
43Jn 9:33 If this man were not from God, he couldn't do anything like that." 
43Jn 9:34 They asked him, "You were born a sinner and you are trying to instruct us?" And they threw him out.
43Jn 9:35 Jesus heard that they had thrown him out. So when he found him, he asked him, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
43Jn 9:36 He answered, "And who is he, sir? Tell me, so that I may believe in him."
43Jn 9:37 Jesus said to him, "You have seen him. He is the person who is talking with you."9
43Jn 9:38 He said, "Lord, I do believe," and worshiped him.
43Jn 9:39 Then Jesus said, "I have come into this world to judge it, so that those who are blind may see and so that those who see may become blind." 
43Jn 9:40 Some of the Pharisees who were near him overheard this and asked him, "We aren't blind, too, are we?" 
43Jn 9:41 Jesus told them, "If you were blind, you would not have any sin. But now that you insist, 'We see,' your sin still exists." 
43Jn 10:1 "Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, the person who does not enter the sheepfold through the gate, but climbs in by some other way, is a thief and a bandit.
43Jn 10:2 The one who enters through the gate is the shepherd of the sheep.
43Jn 10:3 It is to him the gatekeeper opens the gate, and it is his voice the sheep hear. He calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
43Jn 10:4 When he has driven out all his own, he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him because they recognize his voice.
43Jn 10:5 They will never follow a stranger, but will run away from him because they do not recognize the voice of strangers."
43Jn 10:6 Jesus used this illustration with them, but they didn't understand what he was saying to them.
43Jn 10:7 So again Jesus said, "Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, I am the gate for the sheep.
43Jn 10:8 All who came before me are thieves and bandits, but the sheep didn't listen to them.
43Jn 10:9 I am the gate. If anyone enters through me, he will be saved. He will come in and go out and find pasture.
43Jn 10:10 The thief comes only to steal, slaughter, and destroy. I have come that they may have life, and have it abundantly.
43Jn 10:11 "I am the good shepherd. The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
43Jn 10:12 The hired worker, who is not the shepherd and does not own the sheep, sees the wolf coming, deserts the sheep, and runs away. So the wolf snatches them and scatters them,
43Jn 10:13 because he is a hired worker, and the sheep don't matter to him.
43Jn 10:14 I am the good shepherd. I know my own and my own know me,
43Jn 10:15 just as the Father knows me and I know the Father. And I lay down my life for the sheep.
43Jn 10:16 I have other sheep that don't belong to this fold. I must lead these also, and they will listen to my voice. So there will be one flock and one shepherd.
43Jn 10:17 This is why the Father loves me, because I lay down my life in order to take it back again.
43Jn 10:18 No one is taking it from me; I lay it down of my own free will. I have the authority to lay it down, and I have the authority to take it back again. This is what my Father has commanded me."
43Jn 10:19 Once again there was a division among the Jews because of what Jesus had been saying.
43Jn 10:20 Many of them were saying, "He has a demon and is insane. Why bother listening to him?" 
43Jn 10:21 Others were saying, "These are not the words of a man who is demon-possessed. A demon cannot open the eyes of the blind, can it?" 
43Jn 10:22 Now Hanukkah was taking place in Jerusalem. It was winter,
43Jn 10:23 and Jesus was walking around in the temple inside the open porch of Solomon.
43Jn 10:24 So the Jews surrounded him and quizzed him, "How long are you going to keep us in suspense? If you are the Messiah, tell us so plainly."
43Jn 10:25 Jesus answered them, "I have told you, but you do not believe it. The actions that I do in my Father's name testify on my behalf,
43Jn 10:26 but you do not believe because you do not belong to my sheep.
43Jn 10:27 My sheep hear my voice. I know them, and they follow me.
43Jn 10:28 I give them eternal life, they will never be lost, and no one will snatch them out of my hand.
43Jn 10:29 What my Father has given me is more important than anything, and no one can snatch it from the Father's hand.
43Jn 10:30 I and the Father are one."28
43Jn 10:31 Again the Jews picked up stones to stone him to death.
43Jn 10:32 Jesus replied to them, "I have shown you many good actions from my Father. For which of them are you going to stone me?"
43Jn 10:33 The Jews answered him, "We are not going to stone you for a good action, but for blasphemy, because you, a mere man, are making yourself God!"10
43Jn 10:34 Jesus replied to them, "Is it not written in your law, 'I said, "You are gods"' - 
43Jn 10:35 If he called those to whom the word of God came 'gods' (and the Scripture cannot be disregarded),
43Jn 10:36 how can you say to the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world, 'You are blaspheming,' because I said, 'I am the Son of God' - 
43Jn 10:37 If I am not doing my Father's actions, do not believe me.
43Jn 10:38 But if I am doing them, even though you do not believe me, believe the actions, so that you may know and understand that the Father is in me and I am in the Father."
43Jn 10:39 Again they tried to seize him, but he slipped away from them.
43Jn 10:40 Then he went away again across the Jordan to the place where John had been baptizing at first, and he remained there.
43Jn 10:41 Many people came to him and kept saying, "John never performed a sign, but everything that John said about this man is true!"
43Jn 10:42 And many believed in Jesus there. 
43Jn 11:1 Now a certain man was ill, Lazarus from Bethany, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
43Jn 11:2 Mary was the woman who anointed the Lord with perfume and wiped his feet with her hair. Her brother Lazarus was the one who was ill.
43Jn 11:3 So the sisters sent word to Jesus, saying, "Lord, the one whom you love is ill."
43Jn 11:4 But when Jesus heard it, he said, "This illness is not meant to end in death. It is for God's glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it."
43Jn 11:5 Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus.
43Jn 11:6 Yet, when he heard that Lazarus was ill, he stayed where he was for two more days. 
43Jn 11:7 After this he said to the disciples, "Let's go back to Judea."
43Jn 11:8 The disciples said to him, "Rabbi, the Jews were just now trying to stone you to death, and you are going back there again?" 
43Jn 11:9 Jesus replied, "There are twelve hours in the day, aren't there? If anyone walks during the day he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
43Jn 11:10 But if anyone walks at night he stumbles, because the light is not in him."
43Jn 11:11 These were the things he said. Then after this he told them, "Our friend Lazarus has fallen asleep, but I am leaving to wake him up." 
43Jn 11:12 So the disciples said to him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will get well."
43Jn 11:13 Jesus, however, had been speaking about his death, but they thought that he was speaking about resting or sleeping.
43Jn 11:14 Then Jesus told them plainly, "Lazarus has died.
43Jn 11:15 For your sake I am glad that I was not there, so that you may believe. But let's go to him."
43Jn 11:16 Then Thomas, who was called the Twin, said to his fellow disciples, "Let's go, too, so that we may die with him!"
43Jn 11:17 When Jesus arrived, he found that Lazarus had already been in the tomb for four days.
43Jn 11:18 Now Bethany was near Jerusalem, about two miles away,
43Jn 11:19 and many of the Jews had come to Martha and Mary to console them about their brother.
43Jn 11:20 As soon as Martha heard that Jesus was coming, she went and met him, while Mary stayed at home.
43Jn 11:21 Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.
43Jn 11:22 But even now I know that whatever you ask of God, he will give it to you." 
43Jn 11:23 Jesus told her, "Your brother will rise again."
43Jn 11:24 Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day." 
43Jn 11:25 Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life. The person who believes in me, even though he dies, will live.
43Jn 11:26 Indeed, everyone who lives and believes in me will never die. Do you believe that?"
43Jn 11:27 "Yes, Lord," she said to him. "I believe that you are the Messiah, the Son of God, the one who was to come into the world." 
43Jn 11:28 When she had said this, she went away and called her sister Mary and told her privately, "The Teacher is here and is calling for you!"
43Jn 11:29 As soon as Mary heard this, she got up quickly and went to him.
43Jn 11:30 Now Jesus had not yet arrived at the village but was still at the place where Martha had met him.
43Jn 11:31 When the Jews who had been with her, consoling her in the house, saw Mary get up quickly and go out, they followed her, thinking that she had gone to the tomb to cry there. 
43Jn 11:32 As soon as Mary came to where Jesus was and saw him, she fell down at his feet and said to him, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died." 
43Jn 11:33 When Jesus saw her crying, and the Jews who had come with her crying, he was greatly troubled in spirit and deeply moved.
43Jn 11:34 He asked, "Where have you put him?" They said to him, "Lord, come and see."
43Jn 11:35 Jesus burst into tears. 
43Jn 11:36 So the Jews said, "See how much he loved him!"
43Jn 11:37 But some of them said, "Surely the one who opened the eyes of the blind man could have kept this man from dying, couldn't he?" 
43Jn 11:38 Groaning deeply again, Jesus came to the tomb. It was a cave, and a stone was lying in front of it.
43Jn 11:39 Jesus said, "Remove the stone." Martha, the dead man's sister, told him, "Lord, there must be a stench by now, because he's been dead for four days."
43Jn 11:40 Jesus said to her, "I told you that if you believed you would see God's glory, didn't I?"
43Jn 11:41 So they removed the stone. Then Jesus looked upward and said, "Father, I thank you for hearing me.
43Jn 11:42 I know that you always hear me, but I have said this for the sake of the crowd standing here, so that they may believe that you sent me." 
43Jn 11:43 After saying this, he shouted with a loud voice, "Lazarus, come out!"
43Jn 11:44 The man who had died came out, his hands and feet tied with strips of cloth, and his face wrapped in a handkerchief. Jesus told them, "Untie him, and let him go." 
43Jn 11:45 Many of the Jews who had come with Mary and had observed what Jesus did believed in him.
43Jn 11:46 Some of them, however, went to the Pharisees and told them what Jesus had done.
43Jn 11:47 So the high priests and the Pharisees assembled the Council and said, "What are we going to do? This man is performing many signs.
43Jn 11:48 If we let him go on like this, everyone will believe in him, and the Romans will come and destroy both our temple and our nation."
43Jn 11:49 But one of them, Caiaphas, who was high priest that year, told them, "You don't know anything!
43Jn 11:50 You don't realize that it is better for you to have one man die for the people than to have the whole nation destroyed."
43Jn 11:51 Now he did not say this on his own initiative. As high priest that year, he prophesied that Jesus would die for the nation,
43Jn 11:52 and not only for the nation, but that he would also gather into one the children of God who were scattered abroad.
43Jn 11:53 So from that day on they resolved to put him to death.
43Jn 11:54 As a result, Jesus no longer walked openly among the Jews. Instead, he went from there to a town called Ephraim in the region near the wilderness. There he remained with his disciples. 
43Jn 11:55 Now the Jewish Passover was approaching, and before the Passover many people from the countryside went up to Jerusalem to purify themselves.
43Jn 11:56 They kept looking for Jesus and saying to one another as they stood in the temple, "What do you think? Surely he won't come to the festival, will he?"
43Jn 11:57 Now the high priests and the Pharisees had given orders that whoever knew where he was should tell them so that they could arrest him.
43Jn 12:1 Six days before the Passover, Jesus arrived in Bethany, where Lazarus lived, the man whom Jesus had raised from the dead.
43Jn 12:2 There they gave a dinner for him. Martha served, and Lazarus was one of those at the table with him.
43Jn 12:3 Mary took a pound of very expensive perfume made of pure nard and anointed Jesus' feet. She wiped his feet with her hair, and the house became filled with the fragrance of the perfume. 
43Jn 12:4 But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples, who was going to betray him, asked,
43Jn 12:5 "Why wasn't this perfume sold for30 0 denarii and the money given to the destitute?"
43Jn 12:6 He said this, not because he cared about the destitute, but because he was a thief. He was in charge of the moneybag and would steal what was put into it. 
43Jn 12:7 Then Jesus said, "Leave her alone so she can observe the day of my burial,
43Jn 12:8 because you will always have the destitute with you, but you will not always have me." 
43Jn 12:9 When the large crowd of Jews realized that he was there, they came not only because of Jesus but also to see Lazarus, whom he had raised from the dead.
43Jn 12:10 So the high priests planned to kill Lazarus, too,
43Jn 12:11 since he was the reason why so many of the Jews were leaving to believe in Jesus. 
43Jn 12:12 The next day the large crowd that had come to the festival heard that Jesus was coming into Jerusalem.
43Jn 12:13 So they took branches of palm trees and went out to meet him, shouting, "Hosanna! How blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord, the King of Israel!"
43Jn 12:14 Then Jesus found a young donkey and sat upon it, as it is written£º 
43Jn 12:15 "Stop being afraid, people of Zion. Look, your king is coming, sitting upon a donkey's colt!"
43Jn 12:16 At first his disciples didn't understand these things. However, when Jesus had been glorified, they remembered that these things had been written about him and that people had done these things to him.
43Jn 12:17 So the crowd that had been with him when he called Lazarus out of the tomb and raised him from the dead continued to testify to what they had seen.
43Jn 12:18 The crowd was going out to meet Jesus because they had heard that he had performed this sign.
43Jn 12:19 Then the Pharisees said to one another, "You see, there is nothing you can do. Look, the world has gone after him!"16
43Jn 12:20 Now some Greeks were among those who had come up to worship at the festival.
43Jn 12:21 They went to Philip (who was from Bethsaida in Galilee) and told him, "Sir, we would like to see Jesus."
43Jn 12:22 Philip went and told Andrew, and Andrew and Philip went and told Jesus.
43Jn 12:23 Jesus said to them, "The hour has come for the Son of Man to be glorified.
43Jn 12:24 Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it remains alone. But if it dies, it produces a lot of grain.
43Jn 12:25 The one who loves his life will destroy it, and the one who hates his life in this world will preserve it for eternal life.
43Jn 12:26 If anyone serves me, he must follow me. And where I am, there my servant will also be. If anyone serves me, the Father will honor him." 
43Jn 12:27 "Now my soul is in turmoil, and what should I say?'Father, save me from this hour'? No! It was for this very reason that I came to this hour.
43Jn 12:28 Father, glorify your name." Then a voice came from heaven, "I have glorified it, and I will glorify it again!"
43Jn 12:29 The crowd standing there heard this and said that it was thunder. Others were saying, "An angel has spoken to him."
43Jn 12:30 Jesus replied, "This voice is for your benefit, not for mine.
43Jn 12:31 Now is the time for the judgment of this world to begin. Now will the ruler of this world be thrown out.
43Jn 12:32 As for me, if I am lifted up from the earth, I will draw all people to myself."
43Jn 12:33 He said this to indicate the kind of death he was about to die. 
43Jn 12:34 Then the crowd answered him, "We have learned from the Law that the Messiah remains forever. So how can you say that the Son of Man must be lifted up? Who is this Son of Man?" 
43Jn 12:35 Jesus replied to the crowd, "The light is among you only for a short time. Walk while you have the light, so that the darkness may not overtake you. The person who walks in the darkness is in the darkness and does not know where he is going.
43Jn 12:36 As long as you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of light." After Jesus had said this, he went away and hid from them.
43Jn 12:37 Although he had performed numerous signs in their presence, they did not believe in him,
43Jn 12:38 so that what the prophet Isaiah spoke might be fulfilled when he said£º "Lord, who has believed our message, and to whom has the Lord's power been revealed?"
43Jn 12:39 This is why they could not believe£º Isaiah also said,
43Jn 12:40 "He has blinded their eyes and hardened their heart, so that they might not perceive with their eyes, and understand with their mind and turn, and I would heal them."
43Jn 12:41 Isaiah said this when he saw his glory and spoke about him.
43Jn 12:42 Yet many people, even some of the authorities, believed in him, but because of the Pharisees they did not admit it so they would not be thrown out of the synagogue.
43Jn 12:43 For they loved the praise of human beings more than the praise of God. 
43Jn 12:44 Then Jesus said loudly, "The one who believes in me does not believe in me only, but also in the one who sent me.
43Jn 12:45 The one who sees me sees the one who sent me.
43Jn 12:46 I have come into the world as light, so that everyone who believes in me will not remain in the darkness.
43Jn 12:47 If anyone hears my words and does not keep them, I do not condemn him, because I did not come to condemn the world but to save it.
43Jn 12:48 The one who rejects me and does not receive my words has something to judge him£º The word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day,
43Jn 12:49 because I have not spoken on my own authority. Instead, the Father who sent me has himself commanded me what to say and how to speak.
43Jn 12:50 And I know that what he commands brings eternal life. What I speak, therefore, I speak just as the Father has told me."
43Jn 13:1 Now before the Passover Festival, Jesus realized that his hour had come to leave this world and return to the Father. Having loved his own who were in the world, he loved them to the end.
43Jn 13:2 By supper time, the devil had already put it into the heart of Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot, to betray him.
43Jn 13:3 Because Jesus knew that the Father had given everything into his control, that he had come from God, and that he was returning to God,
43Jn 13:4 therefore he got up from the table, removed his outer robe, and took a towel and fastened it around his waist.
43Jn 13:5 Then he poured some water into a basin and began to wash the disciples' feet and to dry them with the towel that was tied around his waist.4
43Jn 13:6 Then he came to Simon Peter, who asked him, "Lord, are you going to wash my feet?" 
43Jn 13:7 Jesus answered him, "You do not realize now what I am doing, but later on you will understand." 
43Jn 13:8 Peter said to him, "You must never wash my feet!"Jesus answered him, "Unless I wash you, you cannot be involved with me."
43Jn 13:9 Simon Peter said to him, "Lord, not just my feet, but my hands and my head as well!"
43Jn 13:10 Jesus told him, "Whoever has bathed is entirely clean. He doesn't need to wash himself further, except for his feet. And you men are clean, though not all of you."
43Jn 13:11 For he knew who was going to betray him. That's why he said, "Not all of you are clean."1310
43Jn 13:12 When Jesus had washed their feet and put on his outer robe, he sat down again and said to them, "Do you realize what I have done to you - 
43Jn 13:13 You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right because that is what I am.
43Jn 13:14 So if I, your Lord and Teacher, have washed your feet, you must also wash one another's feet.
43Jn 13:15 I have set an example for you, so that you may do as I have done to you.
43Jn 13:16 Truly, I say to you with certainty, a servant is not greater than his master, and a messenger is not greater than the one who sent him.
43Jn 13:17 If you understand these things, how blessed you are if you put them into practice!
43Jn 13:18 I'm not talking about all of you. I know the ones I have chosen. But the Scripture must be fulfilled£º 'The one who ate bread with me has turned against me.'
43Jn 13:19 I'm telling you this now, before it happens, so that when it does happen, you may believe that I AM.
43Jn 13:20 Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, the one who receives whomever I send receives me, and the one who receives me receives the one who sent me."18
43Jn 13:21 After saying this, Jesus was deeply troubled in spirit and declared solemnly, "Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, one of you is going to betray me!"
43Jn 13:22 The disciples began looking at one another, completely mystified about whom he was speaking.
43Jn 13:23 One of his disciples, the one whom Jesus kept loving, had been sitting very close to him.
43Jn 13:24 So Simon Peter motioned to this man to ask Jesus about whom he was speaking.
43Jn 13:25 Leaning forward on Jesus' chest, he asked him, "Lord, who is it?"
43Jn 13:26 Jesus answered, "He is the one to whom I will give this piece of bread after I have dipped it in the dish." Then he took a piece of bread, dipped it, and gave it to Judas, the son of Simon Iscariot.
43Jn 13:27 After he had taken the piece of bread, Satan entered him. Then Jesus said to him, "Do quickly what you are going to do!"
43Jn 13:28 Now no one at the table knew why Jesus said this to him.
43Jn 13:29 Some thought that, since Judas had the moneybag, Jesus was telling him to buy what they needed for the festival or to give something to the destitute.
43Jn 13:30 So Judas took the piece of bread, immediately went outside, and it was night.
43Jn 13:31 After Judas had gone out, Jesus said, "The Son of Man is now glorified, and God has been glorified by him.
43Jn 13:32 If God has been glorified by him, God himself also will glorify the Son of Man, and he will do so quickly.
43Jn 13:33 Little children, I am with you only a little longer. You will look for me, but what I told the Jews I now tell you, 'Where I am going, you cannot come.'
43Jn 13:34 I am giving you a new commandment to love one another. Just as I have loved you, you also should love one another.
43Jn 13:35 This is how everyone will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another." 
43Jn 13:36 Simon Peter asked him, "Lord, where are you going?"Jesus answered him, "I am going where you cannot follow me now, though you will follow me later on." 
43Jn 13:37 "Lord, why can't I follow you now?" Peter askd him. "I would lay down my life for you!"
43Jn 13:38 Jesus answered him, "Would you lay down your life for me? Truly, I tell you with certainty, a rooster will not crow until you have denied me three times."
43Jn 14:1 "Do not let your hearts be troubled. Believe in God, believe also in me.
43Jn 14:2 There are many rooms in my Father's house. If there were not, would I have told you that I am going away to prepare a place for you - 
43Jn 14:3 And if I am going away to prepare a place for you, I will come back again and welcome you into my presence, so that you may be where I am.
43Jn 14:4 You know where I am going, and you know the way."
43Jn 14:5 Thomas asked him, "Lord, we don't know where you are going, so how can we know the way?"
43Jn 14:6 Jesus said to him, "I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through me.
43Jn 14:7 If you have known me, you will also know my Father. From now on you know him and have seen him." 
43Jn 14:8 Philip said to him, "Lord, show us the Father, and that will satisfy us."
43Jn 14:9 "Have I been with you all this time, Philip, and you still do not know me?" Jesus asked him. "The person who has seen me has seen the Father. So how can you say, 'Show us the Father' - 
43Jn 14:10 You believe, don't you, that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that I say to you I do not speak on my own. It is the Father who dwells in me and who carries out his work.
43Jn 14:11 Believe me, I am in the Father and the Father is in me. Otherwise, believe me because of what I've been doing.
43Jn 14:12 "Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, the one who believes in me will also do what I am doing. He will do even greater things than these, because I am going to the Father.
43Jn 14:13 I will do whatever you ask in my name, so that the Father may be glorified in the Son.
43Jn 14:14 If you ask me for anything in my name, I will do it."
43Jn 14:15 "If you love me, keep my commandments.
43Jn 14:16 I will ask the Father to give you another Helper, to be with you always.
43Jn 14:17 He is the Spirit of truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it neither sees him nor recognizes him. But you recognize him, because he lives with you and will be in you.
43Jn 14:18 I am not going to forsake you like orphans. I will come back to you. 
43Jn 14:19 "In a little while the world will no longer see me, but you will see me. Because I live, you will live also.
43Jn 14:20 At that time you will know that I am in my Father, that you are in me, and that I am in you.
43Jn 14:21 The person who has my commandments and keeps them is the one who loves me. The one who loves me will be loved by my Father, and I, too, will love him and reveal myself to him." 
43Jn 14:22 Judas (not Iscariot) asked him, "Lord, how is it that you are going to reveal yourself to us and not to the world?" 
43Jn 14:23 Jesus answered him, "If anyone loves me, he will keep my word. Then my Father will love him, and we will go to him and make our home within him.
43Jn 14:24 The one who does not love me does not keep my words. The words that you're hearing me say are not mine, but come from the Father who sent me. 
43Jn 14:25 "I have told you this while I am still with you.
43Jn 14:26 But the Helper, the Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, will teach you all things and remind you of everything that I have told you.
43Jn 14:27 I am leaving you at peace. I am giving you my own peace. I am not giving it to you as the world gives. So don't let your hearts be troubled, and don't be afraid.
43Jn 14:28 You have heard me tell you, 'I am going away, but I am coming back to you.' If you loved me, you would rejoice that I am going to the Father, because the Father is greater than I am.
43Jn 14:29 I have told you this now, before I leave, so that when I do leave, you will believe.
43Jn 14:30 I will not talk with you much longer, because the ruler of this world is coming. He has no power over me.
43Jn 14:31 But I am doing what the Father has commanded me to let the world know that I love the Father. Get up! Let us leave this place."
43Jn 15:1 "I am the true vine, and my Father is the vintner.
43Jn 15:2 He cuts off every branch that does not produce fruit in me, and he cuts back every branch that does produce fruit, so that it might produce more fruit.
43Jn 15:3 You are already clean because of what I've spoken to you. 
43Jn 15:4 "Abide in me, and I will abide in you. Just as the branch cannot produce fruit by itself unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me.
43Jn 15:5 I am the vine, you are the branches. The one who abides in me while I abide in him produces much fruit, because apart from me you can do nothing.
43Jn 15:6 Unless a person abides in me, he is thrown away like a pruned branch and dries up. People gather such branches, throw them into a fire, and they are burned up.
43Jn 15:7 "If you abide in me and my words abide in you, you can ask for anything you want, and you will receive it.
43Jn 15:8 This is how my Father is glorified, when you produce a lot of fruit and so prove to be my disciples.
43Jn 15:9 Just as the Father has loved me, so I have loved you. So abide in my love.
43Jn 15:10 If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's commandments and abide in his love.
43Jn 15:11 I have told you this so that my joy may be in you, and that your joy may be complete.
43Jn 15:12 "This is my commandment£º that you love one another as I have loved you.
43Jn 15:13 No one shows greater love than when he lays down his life for his friends.
43Jn 15:14 You are my friends if you do what I command you.
43Jn 15:15 I do not call you servants anymore, because a servant does not know what his master is doing. But I have called you friends, because I have made known to you everything that I have heard from my Father. 
43Jn 15:16 "You have not chosen me, but I have chosen you. I have appointed you to go and produce fruit that will last, so that whatever you ask the Father in my name, he will give it to you.
43Jn 15:17 I am giving you these commandments so that you may love one another." 
43Jn 15:18 "If the world hates you, you should realize that it hated me before you.
43Jn 15:19 If you belonged to the world, the world would love you as one of its own. But because you do not belong to the world and I have chosen you out of it, the world hates you.
43Jn 15:20 Remember what I told you£º 'A servant is not greater than his master.' If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours.
43Jn 15:21 They will do all these things to you on account of my name, because they do not know the one who sent me.
43Jn 15:22 "If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have any sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin.
43Jn 15:23 The person who hates me also hates my Father.
43Jn 15:24 If I had not done among them the actions that no one else did, they would not have any sin. But now they have seen and hated both me and my Father.
43Jn 15:25 But this happened so that what has been written in their law might be fulfilled£º 'They hated me for no reason.'
43Jn 15:26 "When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, the Spirit of Truth who comes from the Father, he will testify on my behalf.
43Jn 15:27 You will testify also, because you have been with me from the beginning. 
43Jn 16:1 "I have told you this to keep you from falling away.
43Jn 16:2 You will be thrown out of the synagogues. Yes, a time is coming when the one who kills you will think he is serving God.
43Jn 16:3 They will do this because they have not known the Father or me.
43Jn 16:4 But I have told you this so that when the time comes you will remember that I told you about them. I did not tell you this in the beginning, because I was still with you."
43Jn 16:5 "But now I am going to the one who sent me. Yet none of you asks me, 'Where are you going?'
43Jn 16:6 But because I have told you this, sorrow has filled your hearts.
43Jn 16:7 However, I am telling you the truth. It is for your advantage that I am going away, because if I do not go away the Helper will not come to you. But if I go, I will send him to you.
43Jn 16:8 When he comes, he will convict the world of sin, righteousness, and judgment - 
43Jn 16:9 of sin, because they do not believe in me;
43Jn 16:10 of righteousness, because I am going to the Father and you will no longer see me;
43Jn 16:11 and of judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.10
43Jn 16:12 "I still have a lot to say to you, but you cannot bear it now.
43Jn 16:13 Yet when the Spirit of Truth comes, he will guide you into all truth. He will not speak on his own accord, but will speak whatever he hears and will declare to you the things that are to come.
43Jn 16:14 He will glorify me, because he will take what is mine and declare it to you.
43Jn 16:15 All that the Father has is mine. That is why I said, 'He will take what is mine and declare it to you.'
43Jn 16:16 In a little while you will no longer see me, then in a little while you will see me again." 
43Jn 16:17 At this point, some of his disciples asked each other, "What does he mean by telling us, 'In a little while you will no longer see me, then in a little while you will see me again,' and 'because I am going to the Father'?"
43Jn 16:18 They kept saying, "What is this 'in a little while' that he keeps talking about? We don't know what he means."
43Jn 16:19 Jesus knew that they wanted to ask him a question, so he asked them, "Are you discussing among yourselves what I meant when I said, 'In a little while you will no longer see me, then in a little while you will see me again' - 
43Jn 16:20 Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, you will cry and mourn, but the world will rejoice. You will be deeply distressed, but your pain will turn into joy.
43Jn 16:21 When a woman is in labor she has pain, because her time has come. Yet when she has given birth to her child, she doesn't remember the agony anymore because of the joy of having brought a human being into the world.
43Jn 16:22 Now you are having pain. But I will see you again, and your hearts will rejoice, and no one will take your joy away from you.
43Jn 16:23 On that day, you will not ask me for anything. Truly, I tell all of you with certainty, whatever you ask the Father for in my name, he will give it to you.
43Jn 16:24 So far you haven't asked for anything in my name. Keep asking and you will receive, so that your joy may be complete."16
43Jn 16:25 "I have said these things to you in figurative language. The time is coming when I will no longer speak to you in figurative language, but will tell you plainly about the Father.
43Jn 16:26 At that time, you will make your requests in my name, so that I will have no need to ask the Father on your behalf,
43Jn 16:27 because the Father himself loves you, and because you have loved me and believed that I came from God.
43Jn 16:28 I left the Father and came into the world. Now I am leaving the world and going back to the Father." 
43Jn 16:29 Jesus' disciples said, "Well, now you're speaking plainly and not using figurative language.
43Jn 16:30 Now we know that you know everything and do not need to have anyone ask you any questions. Because of this, we believe that you have come from God." 
43Jn 16:31 Jesus answered them, "Do you now believe - 
43Jn 16:32 Listen, the time is coming, indeed it has already come, when you will be scattered, each of you to his own home, and you will leave me all by myself. Yet I am not alone, because the Father is with me.
43Jn 16:33 I have told you this so that through me you may have peace. In the world you will have trouble, but be courageous - I have overcome the world!" 
43Jn 17:1 After Jesus had said this, he looked up to heaven and said, "Father, the hour has come. Glorify your Son, so that the Son may glorify you.
43Jn 17:2 For you have given him authority over all humanity so that he might give eternal life to all those you gave him.
43Jn 17:3 And this is eternal life£º to know you, the only true God, and the one whom you sent - Jesus the Messiah.
43Jn 17:4 I glorified you on earth by completing the task you gave me to do.1
43Jn 17:5 "So now, Father, glorify me in your presence with the glory I had with you before the world existed.
43Jn 17:6 I have made your name known to these men whom you gave me from the world. They were yours, and you gave them to me, and they have kept your word.
43Jn 17:7 Now they realize that everything you gave me comes from you,
43Jn 17:8 because the words that you gave me I passed on to them. They have received them and know for sure that I came from you. They have believed that you sent me.
43Jn 17:9 "I am asking on their behalf. I am not asking on behalf of the world, but on behalf of those you gave me, because they are yours.
43Jn 17:10 All that is mine is yours, and what is yours is mine, and I have been glorified through them.
43Jn 17:11 I am no longer in the world, but they are in the world, and I am coming to you. Holy Father, protect them by your name, the name that you gave me, so that they may be one, as we are one.
43Jn 17:12 While I was with them, I protected them by the authority that you gave me. I guarded them, and not one of them became lost except the one who was destined for destruction, so that the Scripture might be fulfilled.10
43Jn 17:13 "And now I am coming to you, and I say these things in the world so that they may have my joy made complete in themselves.
43Jn 17:14 I have given them your word, and the world has hated them, because they do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.
43Jn 17:15 I am not asking you to take them out of the world but to protect them from the evil one.
43Jn 17:16 They do not belong to the world, just as I do not belong to the world.
43Jn 17:17 "Sanctify them by the truth. Your word is truth.
43Jn 17:18 Just as you sent me into the world, so I have sent them into the world.
43Jn 17:19 It is for their sakes that I sanctify myself, so that they, too, may be sanctified by the truth.
43Jn 17:20 I ask not only on behalf of these men, but also on behalf of those who will believe in me through their message,
43Jn 17:21 so that they may all be one. Just as you, Father, are in me and I am in you, may they also be one in us, so that the world may believe that you sent me.
43Jn 17:22 "I have given them the glory that you gave me, so that they may be one, just as we are one.
43Jn 17:23 I am in them, and you are in me. May they be completely one, so that the world may know that you sent me and that you have loved them as you loved me.
43Jn 17:24 Father, I want those you have given me to be with me where I am and to see my glory, which you gave me because you loved me before the creation of the world.1721
43Jn 17:25 "Righteous Father, the world has never known you. Yet I have known you, and these men have known that you sent me.
43Jn 17:26 I made your name known to them, and will continue to make it known, so that the love you have for me may be in them and I myself may be in them." 
43Jn 18:1 Ater Jesus had said this, he went with his disciples across the Kidron valley to a place where there was a garden, which he and his disciples entered.
43Jn 18:2 Now Judas, who betrayed him, also knew the place because Jesus often met there with his disciples.
43Jn 18:3 So Judas took a detachment of soldiers and some officers from the high priests and the Pharisees and went there with lanterns, torches, and weapons. 
43Jn 18:4 Then Jesus, knowing everything that was going to happen, went forward and asked them, "Who are you looking for?"
43Jn 18:5 They answered him, "Jesus from Nazareth." Jesus said to them, "I AM." Judas, the man who betrayed him, was standing with them. 
43Jn 18:6 When Jesus told them, "I AM," they backed away and fell to the ground.
43Jn 18:7 So he asked them again, "Who are you looking for?" They said, "Jesus from Nazareth."
43Jn 18:8 Jesus replied, "I told you that I am the one, so if you are looking for me, let these men go."
43Jn 18:9 This was to fulfill what he had said, "I did not lose a single one of those you gave me."
43Jn 18:10 Then Simon Peter, who had a sword, drew it and struck the high priest's servant, cutting off his right ear. The servant's name was Malchus.
43Jn 18:11 Jesus told Peter, "Put your sword back into its sheath. Shouldn't I drink the cup that the Father has given me?" 
43Jn 18:12 Then the soldiers, along with their commander and the Jewish officers, arrested Jesus and tied him up.
43Jn 18:13 First they brought him to Annas, because he was the father-in-law of Caiaphas, the high priest that year.
43Jn 18:14 Caiaphas was the person who had advised the Jews that it was better to have one man die for the people.12
43Jn 18:15 Simon Peter and another disciple were following Jesus. Since the other disciple was known to the high priest, he accompanied Jesus into the courtyard of the high priest.
43Jn 18:16 Peter, however, stood outside the gate. So this other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the gatekeeper and brought Peter inside.
43Jn 18:17 The young woman at the gate asked Peter, "You aren't one of this man's disciples, too, are you?""I am not," he replied.
43Jn 18:18 Meanwhile, the servants and officers were standing around a charcoal fire they had built and were warming themselves because it was cold. Peter was also standing with them, keeping himself warm.
43Jn 18:19 Then the high priest questioned Jesus about his disciples and about his own teaching.
43Jn 18:20 Jesus answered him, "I have spoken publicly to the world. I have always taught in the synagogue or in the temple, where all Jews meet together, and I have said nothing in secret.
43Jn 18:21 Why do you question me? Question those who heard what I said. These are the people who know what I said."
43Jn 18:22 When he said this, one of the officers standing nearby slapped Jesus on the face and demanded, "Is that any way to answer the high priest?" 
43Jn 18:23 Jesus answered him, "If I have said anything wrong, tell me what it was. But if I have told the truth, why do you hit me?"
43Jn 18:24 Then Annas sent him, with his hands tied, to Caiaphas the high priest. 
43Jn 18:25 Meanwhile, Simon Peter was standing and warming himself. Some people asked him, "You aren't one of his disciples, too, are you?" He denied it by saying, "I am not!" 
43Jn 18:26 Then one of the high priest's servants, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off, said, "I saw you in the garden with Jesus, didn't I?"
43Jn 18:27 Peter again denied it, and immediately a rooster crowed. 
43Jn 18:28 Then Jesus was led from Caiaphas to the governor's headquarters early in the morning. The Jews did not go into the headquarters, to avoid becoming unclean and unable to eat the Passover meal.
43Jn 18:29 So Pilate came out to them and asked, "What accusation are you bringing against this man?"
43Jn 18:30 They answered him, "If he weren't a criminal, we wouldn't have handed him over to you."
43Jn 18:31 Pilate told them, "You take him and try him according to your law." The Jews said to him, "It is not legal for us to put anyone to death."
43Jn 18:32 This was to fulfill what Jesus had said when he indicated the kind of death he was to die. 
43Jn 18:33 So Pilate went back into the governor's headquarters, summoned Jesus, and asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" 
43Jn 18:34 Jesus replied, "Are you asking this on your own initiative, or did others tell you about me?"
43Jn 18:35 Pilate replied, "I am not a Jew, am I? It is your own nation and high priests who have handed you over to me. What have you done?"
43Jn 18:36 Jesus answered, "My kingdom does not belong to this world. If my kingdom belonged to this world, my servants would fight to keep me from being handed over to the Jews. But for now my kingdom is not from here." 
43Jn 18:37 Pilate asked him, "So you are a king?" Jesus answered, "You say that I am a king. I was born for this, and I came into the world for this£º to testify to the truth. Everyone who is committed to the truth listens to my voice." 
43Jn 18:38 Pilate asked him, "What is 'truth'?" After he said this, he went out to the Jews again and told them, "I find no basis for a charge against him.
43Jn 18:39 But you have a custom that I release one person for you at Passover. Do you want me to release for you the king of the Jews?" 
43Jn 18:40 At this, they shouted out again, "Not this fellow, but Barabbas!" Now Barabbas was a revolutionary.18
43Jn 19:1 Then Pilate had Jesus taken away and whipped.
43Jn 19:2 The soldiers twisted some thorns into a victor's crown, put it on his head, and threw a purple robe on him.
43Jn 19:3 They kept coming up to him and saying, "Long live the king of the Jews!" Then they began to slap him on the face.
43Jn 19:4 Pilate went outside again and told the Jews, "Look, I am bringing him out to you to let you know that I find no basis for a charge against him."
43Jn 19:5 Then Jesus came outside, wearing the victor's crown of thorns and the purple robe. Pilate said to them, "Here is the man!"
43Jn 19:6 When the high priests and the officials saw him, they shouted, "Crucify him! Crucify him!" Pilate told them, "You take him and crucify him. I find no basis for a charge against him." 
43Jn 19:7 The Jews answered Pilate, "We have a law, and according to that law he must die because he made himself out to be the Son of God." 
43Jn 19:8 When Pilate heard this, he became even more afraid.
43Jn 19:9 Returning to his headquarters, he asked Jesus, "Where are you from?"But Jesus did not answer him.
43Jn 19:10 So Pilate asked him, "Aren't you going to speak to me? You realize, don't you, that I have the authority to release you and the authority to crucify you?"
43Jn 19:11 Jesus answered him, "You have no authority over me at all, except what was given to you from above. That's why the one who handed me over to you is guilty of a greater sin." 
43Jn 19:12 From then on, Pilate tried to release him, but the Jews kept shouting, "If you release this fellow, you're not a friend of Caesar! Anyone who claims to be a king is defying Caesar!" 
43Jn 19:13 When Pilate heard these words, he brought Jesus outside and sat down on the judgment seat in a place called The Pavement, which in Hebrew is called Gabbatha.
43Jn 19:14 Now it was the Preparation Day for the Passover, about noon. He said to the Jews, "Here is your king!"13
43Jn 19:15 Then they shouted, "Take him away! Take him away! Crucify him!" Pilate asked them, "Should I crucify your king?" The high priests responded, "We have no king but Caesar!"
43Jn 19:16 Then Pilate handed him over to be crucified, and they took Jesus away. 
43Jn 19:17 Carrying the cross all by himself, he went out to what is called The Place of a Skull, which in Hebrew is called Golgotha.
43Jn 19:18 There they crucified him, along with two others, one on each side of him with Jesus in the middle.
43Jn 19:19 Pilate wrote an inscription and put it on the cross. It read, "Jesus from Nazareth, the King of the Jews."
43Jn 19:20 Many Jews read this inscription, because the place where Jesus was crucified was near the city. It was written in Hebrew, Latin, and Greek.
43Jn 19:21 Then the Jewish high priests told Pilate, "Don't write, 'The King of the Jews,' but that this fellow said, 'I am the King of the Jews.'"
43Jn 19:22 Pilate replied, "What I have written I have written."
43Jn 19:23 When the soldiers had crucified Jesus, they took his clothes and divided them into four parts, one for each soldier, and took his cloak as well. The cloak was seamless, woven in one piece from the top down.
43Jn 19:24 So they said to each other, "Let's not tear it. Instead, let's throw dice to see who gets it." This was to fulfill the Scripture that says, "They divided my clothes among themselves, and for my clothing they threw dice." So that is what the soldiers did.
43Jn 19:25 Meanwhile, standing near Jesus' cross were his mother, his mother's sister, Mary the wife of Clopas, and Mary Magdalene.
43Jn 19:26 When Jesus saw his mother and the disciple whom he kept loving standing there, he said to his mother, "Dear lady, here is your son."
43Jn 19:27 Then he said to the disciple, "Here is your mother." And from that hour the disciple took her into his own home. 
43Jn 19:28 After this, when Jesus realized that everything was now completed, he said (in order to fulfill the Scripture), "I'm thirsty."
43Jn 19:29 A jar of sour wine was standing there, so they put a sponge full of the wine on a branch of hyssop and held it to his mouth.
43Jn 19:30 After Jesus had taken the wine, he said, "It is finished." Then he bowed his head and released his spirit. 
43Jn 19:31 Since it was the Preparation Day, the Jews did not want to leave the bodies on the crosses during the Sabbath, because that was a particularly important Sabbath. So they asked Pilate to have the men's legs broken and the bodies removed.
43Jn 19:32 So the soldiers went and broke the legs of the first man and then of the other man who had been crucified with him.
43Jn 19:33 But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs.
43Jn 19:34 Instead, one of the soldiers pierced his side with a spear, and blood and water immediately came out.
43Jn 19:35 The one who saw this has testified, and his testimony is true. He knows he is telling the truth so that you, too, may believe,
43Jn 19:36 because these things happened so that the Scripture might be fulfilled£º "None of his bones will be broken."
43Jn 19:37 In addition, another passage of Scripture says, "They will look on the one whom they pierced."
43Jn 19:38 Later on, Joseph of Arimathea, who was a disciple of Jesus (though a secret one because he was afraid of the Jews), asked Pilate to let him remove the body of Jesus. Pilate gave him permission, and he came and removed his body.
43Jn 19:39 Nicodemus, the man who had first come to Jesus at night, also arrived, bringing a mixture of myrrh and aloes weighing about a hundred pounds.
43Jn 19:40 They took the body of Jesus and wrapped it in linen cloths along with spices, according to the burial custom of the Jews.
43Jn 19:41 A garden was located in the place where he was crucified, and in that garden was a new tomb in which no one had yet been placed.
43Jn 19:42 Because it was the Jewish Preparation Day, and because the tomb was nearby, they put Jesus there.
43Jn 20:1 On the first day of the week, early in the morning and while it was still dark, Mary Magdalene went to the tomb and noticed that the stone had been removed from the tomb.
43Jn 20:2 So she ran off and went to Simon Peter and the other disciple, whom Jesus kept loving. She told them, "They have taken the Lord out of the tomb, and we don't know where they have put him!"
43Jn 20:3 So Peter and the other disciple took off for the tomb.
43Jn 20:4 The two of them were running together, but the other disciple ran faster than Peter and came to the tomb first.
43Jn 20:5 Bending over to look inside, he noticed the linen cloths lying there but didn't go in.
43Jn 20:6 At this point Simon Peter arrived, following him, and went straight into the tomb. He observed that the linen cloths were lying there,
43Jn 20:7 and that the handkerchief that had been on Jesus' head was not lying with the linen cloths but was rolled up in a separate place.
43Jn 20:8 Then the other disciple, who arrived at the tomb first, went inside, looked, and believed.
43Jn 20:9 For they did not yet understand the Scripture that said that Jesus had to rise from the dead.
43Jn 20:10 So the disciples went back to their homes.
43Jn 20:11 Meanwhile, Mary stood crying outside the tomb. As she cried, she bent over and looked into the tomb.
43Jn 20:12 She saw two angels in white clothes who were sitting down, one at the head and the other at the foot of the place where Jesus' body had been lying.
43Jn 20:13 They asked her, "Lady, why are you crying?" She told them, "Because they have taken away my Lord, and I don't know where they have put him."
43Jn 20:14 After she had said this, she turned around and noticed Jesus standing there, without realizing that it was Jesus. 
43Jn 20:15 Jesus asked her, "Dear lady, why are you crying? Who are you looking for?" Thinking he was the gardener, she said to him, "Sir, if you have carried him away, tell me where you have put him, and I will take him away."
43Jn 20:16 Jesus said to her, "Mary!" She turned around and said to him in Hebrew, "Rabbouni!" (which means "Teacher").
43Jn 20:17 Jesus told her, "Don't hold on to me, because I have not yet ascended to the Father. But go to my brothers and tell them, 'I am ascending to my Father and your Father, to my God and your God.'" 
43Jn 20:18 So Mary Magdalene went and announced to the disciples, "I have seen the Lord!" She also told them what he had said to her. 
43Jn 20:19 It was the evening of the first day of the week, and the doors of the house where the disciples had met were locked because they were afraid of the Jews. Jesus came and stood among them. He said to them, "Peace be with you."
43Jn 20:20 After saying this, he showed them his hands and his side, and when they saw the Lord the disciples were overjoyed.
43Jn 20:21 Jesus said to them again, "Peace be with you. Just as the Father has sent me, so I am sending you."
43Jn 20:22 When he had said this, he breathed on them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit.
43Jn 20:23 If you forgive people's sins, they are forgiven. If you retain people's sins, they are retained."2022 
43Jn 20:24 Thomas, one of the twelve disciples (called the Twin), wasn't with them when Jesus came.
43Jn 20:25 So the other disciples kept telling him, "We have seen the Lord!" But he told them, "Unless I see the nail marks in his hands, put my finger into them, and put my hand into his side, I will never believe!"
43Jn 20:26 A week later his disciples were again inside, and Thomas was with them. Even though the doors were shut, Jesus came, stood among them, and said, "Peace be with you."
43Jn 20:27 Then he said to Thomas, "Put your finger here, and look at my hands. Take your hand, and put it into my side. Stop doubting, but believe." 
43Jn 20:28 Thomas answered him, "My Lord and my God!"
43Jn 20:29 Jesus said to him, "Is it because you have seen me that you have believed? How blessed are those who have never seen me and yet have believed!" 
43Jn 20:30 Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples that are not recorded in this book.
43Jn 20:31 But these have been recorded so that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and so that through believing you may have life in his name. 
43Jn 21:1 Later on, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples at the Sea of Tiberias. This is what happened£º
43Jn 21:2 Simon Peter, Thomas (called the Twin), Nathaniel from Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two of his other disciples were together.
43Jn 21:3 Simon Peter said to them, "I'm going fishing." They all told him, "We'll go with you, too." So they went out and got into the boat but didn't catch a thing that night.
43Jn 21:4 Just as dawn was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore. The disciples didn't realize it was Jesus.
43Jn 21:5 Jesus asked them, "Children, you don't have any fish, do you?" They answered him, "No." 
43Jn 21:6 He told them, "Throw the net on the right hand side of the boat, and you'll catch some." So they threw it out and were unable to haul it in because it was so full of fish. 
43Jn 21:7 That disciple whom Jesus kept loving said to Peter, "It's the Lord!" When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord, he put his clothes back on, because he was practically naked, and jumped into the sea.
43Jn 21:8 But the other disciples came in the boat, dragging the net full of fish. They were only about a hundred yards away from the shore.
43Jn 21:9 When they arrived at the shore, they saw a charcoal fire with fish lying on it, and some bread.
43Jn 21:10 Jesus told them, "Bring me some of the fish you've just caught."
43Jn 21:11 So Simon Peter went aboard and dragged the net ashore. It was full of large fish? 153 of them. And although there were so many of them, the net was not torn.
43Jn 21:12 Then Jesus said to them, "Come, have breakfast." Now none of the disciples dared to ask him, "Who are you?", because they knew it was the Lord.
43Jn 21:13 Jesus took the bread, gave it to them, and did the same with the fish.
43Jn 21:14 This was now the third time that Jesus revealed himself to the disciples after he had been raised from the dead. 
43Jn 21:15 When they had finished breakfast, Jesus asked Simon Peter, "Simon, son of John, do you love me more than these?" Peter said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus told him, "Feed my lambs."
43Jn 21:16 Then he asked him a second time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter said to him, "Yes, Lord, you know that I love you." Jesus told him, "Take care of my sheep."
43Jn 21:17 He asked him a third time, "Simon, son of John, do you love me?" Peter was deeply hurt that he had asked him a third time, "Do you love me?" So he said to him, "Lord, you know everything. You know that I love you!" Jesus told him, "Feed my sheep.
43Jn 21:18 "Truly, I tell you with certainty, when you were young, you would fasten your belt and go wherever you liked. But when you get old, you will stretch out your hands, and someone else will fasten your belt and take you where you don't want to go."
43Jn 21:19 Now he said this to show by what kind of death he would glorify God. After saying this, Jesus told him, "Keep following me." 
43Jn 21:20 Peter turned around and noticed the disciple whom Jesus kept loving following them. He was the one who had put his head on Jesus' chest at the supper and had asked, "Lord, who is the one who is going to betray you?" 
43Jn 21:21 When Peter saw him, he said, "Lord, what about him?"
43Jn 21:22 Jesus said to him, "If it is my will for him to remain until I come back, how does that concern you? You must keep following me!"
43Jn 21:23 So the rumor spread among the brothers that this disciple wasn't going to die. Yet Jesus didn't say to Peter that he wasn't going to die, but, "If it is my will for him to remain until I come back, how does that concern you?"
43Jn 21:24 This is the disciple who is testifying to these things and has written them down. We know that his testimony is true. 
43Jn 21:25 Of course, Jesus also did many other things, and I suppose that if every one of them were written down the world couldn't contain the books that would be written.
