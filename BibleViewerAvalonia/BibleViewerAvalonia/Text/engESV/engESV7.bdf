44Ac 1:1 In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach,
44Ac 1:2 until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen.
44Ac 1:3 He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God.
44Ac 1:4 And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, "you heard from me;
44Ac 1:5 for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now."
44Ac 1:6 So when they had come together, they asked him, "Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?"
44Ac 1:7 He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority.
44Ac 1:8 But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth."
44Ac 1:9 And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight.
44Ac 1:10 And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes,
44Ac 1:11 and said, "Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven."
44Ac 1:12 Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day's journey away.
44Ac 1:13 And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James.
44Ac 1:14 All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers.
44Ac 1:15 In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (the company of persons was in all about 120) and said,
44Ac 1:16 "Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus.
44Ac 1:17 For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry."
44Ac 1:18 (Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out.
44Ac 1:19 And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood.)
44Ac 1:20 "For it is written in the Book of Psalms, "'May his camp become desolate, and let there be no one to dwell in it'; and "'Let another take his office.'
44Ac 1:21 So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
44Ac 1:22 beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us--one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection."
44Ac 1:23 And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias.
44Ac 1:24 And they prayed and said, "You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen
44Ac 1:25 to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place."
44Ac 1:26 And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
44Ac 2:1 When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place.
44Ac 2:2 And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting.
44Ac 2:3 And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them.
44Ac 2:4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance.
44Ac 2:5 Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven.
44Ac 2:6 And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in his own language.
44Ac 2:7 And they were amazed and astonished, saying, "Are not all these who are speaking Galileans?
44Ac 2:8 And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language?
44Ac 2:9 Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia,
44Ac 2:10 Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome,
44Ac 2:11 both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians--we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God."
44Ac 2:12 And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, "What does this mean?"
44Ac 2:13 But others mocking said, "They are filled with new wine."
44Ac 2:14 But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them: "Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words.
44Ac 2:15 For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day.
44Ac 2:16 But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel:
44Ac 2:17 "'And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams;
44Ac 2:18 even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy.
44Ac 2:19 And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke;
44Ac 2:20 the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day.
44Ac 2:21 And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.'
44Ac 2:22 "Men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know--
44Ac 2:23 this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men.
44Ac 2:24 God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it.
44Ac 2:25 For David says concerning him, "'I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken;
44Ac 2:26 therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope.
44Ac 2:27 For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption.
44Ac 2:28 You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence.'
44Ac 2:29 "Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day.
44Ac 2:30 Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne,
44Ac 2:31 he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption.
44Ac 2:32 This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses.
44Ac 2:33 Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing.
44Ac 2:34 For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, "'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand,
44Ac 2:35 until I make your enemies your footstool.'
44Ac 2:36 Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified."
44Ac 2:37 Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, "Brothers, what shall we do?"
44Ac 2:38 And Peter said to them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 2:39 For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself."
44Ac 2:40 And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, "Save yourselves from this crooked generation."
44Ac 2:41 So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.
44Ac 2:42 And they devoted themselves to the apostles' teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers.
44Ac 2:43 And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles.
44Ac 2:44 And all who believed were together and had all things in common.
44Ac 2:45 And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need.
44Ac 2:46 And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts,
44Ac 2:47 praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved.
44Ac 3:1 Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour.
44Ac 3:2 And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple.
44Ac 3:3 Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms.
44Ac 3:4 And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, "Look at us."
44Ac 3:5 And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them.
44Ac 3:6 But Peter said, "I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk!"
44Ac 3:7 And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong.
44Ac 3:8 And leaping up he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God.
44Ac 3:9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God,
44Ac 3:10 and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him.
44Ac 3:11 While he clung to Peter and John, all the people, utterly astounded, ran together to them in the portico called Solomon's.
44Ac 3:12 And when Peter saw it he addressed the people: "Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk?
44Ac 3:13 The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him.
44Ac 3:14 But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you,
44Ac 3:15 and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses.
44Ac 3:16 And his name--by faith in his name--has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all.
44Ac 3:17 "And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers.
44Ac 3:18 But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled.
44Ac 3:19 Repent therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out,
44Ac 3:20 that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus,
44Ac 3:21 whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago.
44Ac 3:22 Moses said, 'The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you.
44Ac 3:23 And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people.'
44Ac 3:24 And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came after him, also proclaimed these days.
44Ac 3:25 You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, 'And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed.'
44Ac 3:26 God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness."
44Ac 4:1 And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them,
44Ac 4:2 greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
44Ac 4:3 And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening.
44Ac 4:4 But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand.
44Ac 4:5 On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem,
44Ac 4:6 with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family.
44Ac 4:7 And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, "By what power or by what name did you do this?"
44Ac 4:8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, "Rulers of the people and elders,
44Ac 4:9 if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed,
44Ac 4:10 let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead--by him this man is standing before you well.
44Ac 4:11 This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone.
44Ac 4:12 And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved."
44Ac 4:13 Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished. And they recognized that they had been with Jesus.
44Ac 4:14 But seeing the man who was healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition.
44Ac 4:15 But when they had commanded them to leave the council, they conferred with one another,
44Ac 4:16 saying, "What shall we do with these men? For that a notable sign has been performed through them is evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it.
44Ac 4:17 But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name."
44Ac 4:18 So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
44Ac 4:19 But Peter and John answered them, "Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge,
44Ac 4:20 for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard."
44Ac 4:21 And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people, for all were praising God for what had happened.
44Ac 4:22 For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old.
44Ac 4:23 When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them.
44Ac 4:24 And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, "Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them,
44Ac 4:25 who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit, "'Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples plot in vain?
44Ac 4:26 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed'--
44Ac 4:27 for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel,
44Ac 4:28 to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place.
44Ac 4:29 And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness,
44Ac 4:30 while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus."
44Ac 4:31 And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness.
44Ac 4:32 Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common.
44Ac 4:33 And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all.
44Ac 4:34 There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold
44Ac 4:35 and laid it at the apostles' feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need.
44Ac 4:36 Thus Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas (which means son of encouragement), a Levite, a native of Cyprus,
44Ac 4:37 sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles' feet.
44Ac 5:1 But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property,
44Ac 5:2 and with his wife's knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles' feet.
44Ac 5:3 But Peter said, "Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land?
44Ac 5:4 While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to men but to God."
44Ac 5:5 When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all who heard of it.
44Ac 5:6 The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him.
44Ac 5:7 After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened.
44Ac 5:8 And Peter said to her, "Tell me whether you sold the land for so much." And she said, "Yes, for so much."
44Ac 5:9 But Peter said to her, "How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out."
44Ac 5:10 Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband.
44Ac 5:11 And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things.
44Ac 5:12 Now many signs and wonders were regularly done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon's Portico.
44Ac 5:13 None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high esteem.
44Ac 5:14 And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women,
44Ac 5:15 so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them.
44Ac 5:16 The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed.
44Ac 5:17 But the high priest rose up, and all who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees), and filled with jealousy
44Ac 5:18 they arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison.
44Ac 5:19 But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said,
44Ac 5:20 "Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life."
44Ac 5:21 And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach. Now when the high priest came, and those who were with him, they called together the council and all the senate of the people of Israel and sent to the prison to have them brought.
44Ac 5:22 But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, so they returned and reported,
44Ac 5:23 "We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them we found no one inside."
44Ac 5:24 Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to.
44Ac 5:25 And someone came and told them, "Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people."
44Ac 5:26 Then the captain with the officers went and brought them, but not by force, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people.
44Ac 5:27 And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them,
44Ac 5:28 saying, "We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man's blood upon us."
44Ac 5:29 But Peter and the apostles answered, "We must obey God rather than men.
44Ac 5:30 The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree.
44Ac 5:31 God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins.
44Ac 5:32 And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him."
44Ac 5:33 When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them.
44Ac 5:34 But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people, stood up and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while.
44Ac 5:35 And he said to them, "Men of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men.
44Ac 5:36 For before these days Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing.
44Ac 5:37 After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered.
44Ac 5:38 So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or this undertaking is of man, it will fail;
44Ac 5:39 but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You might even be found opposing God!" So they took his advice,
44Ac 5:40 and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
44Ac 5:41 Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name.
44Ac 5:42 And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching Jesus as the Christ.
44Ac 6:1 Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution.
44Ac 6:2 And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, "It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables.
44Ac 6:3 Therefore, brothers, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty.
44Ac 6:4 But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word."
44Ac 6:5 And what they said pleased the whole gathering, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch.
44Ac 6:6 These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them.
44Ac 6:7 And the word of God continued to increase, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith.
44Ac 6:8 And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people.
44Ac 6:9 Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen.
44Ac 6:10 But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking.
44Ac 6:11 Then they secretly instigated men who said, "We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God."
44Ac 6:12 And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council,
44Ac 6:13 and they set up false witnesses who said, "This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law,
44Ac 6:14 for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us."
44Ac 6:15 And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel.
44Ac 7:1 And the high priest said, "Are these things so?"
44Ac 7:2 And Stephen said: "Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran,
44Ac 7:3 and said to him, 'Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you.'
44Ac 7:4 Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living.
44Ac 7:5 Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot's length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child.
44Ac 7:6 And God spoke to this effect--that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years.
44Ac 7:7 'But I will judge the nation that they serve,' said God, 'and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place.'
44Ac 7:8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs.
44Ac 7:9 "And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him
44Ac 7:10 and rescued him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household.
44Ac 7:11 Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food.
44Ac 7:12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first visit.
44Ac 7:13 And on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph's family became known to Pharaoh.
44Ac 7:14 And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all.
44Ac 7:15 And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers,
44Ac 7:16 and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem.
44Ac 7:17 "But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt
44Ac 7:18 until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph.
44Ac 7:19 He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive.
44Ac 7:20 At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful in God's sight. And he was brought up for three months in his father's house,
44Ac 7:21 and when he was exposed, Pharaoh's daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son.
44Ac 7:22 And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds.
44Ac 7:23 "When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel.
44Ac 7:24 And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian.
44Ac 7:25 He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand.
44Ac 7:26 And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, 'Men, you are brothers. Why do you wrong each other?'
44Ac 7:27 But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge over us?
44Ac 7:28 Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday?'
44Ac 7:29 At this retort Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons.
44Ac 7:30 "Now when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush.
44Ac 7:31 When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and as he drew near to look, there came the voice of the Lord:
44Ac 7:32 'I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob.' And Moses trembled and did not dare to look.
44Ac 7:33 Then the Lord said to him, 'Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground.
44Ac 7:34 I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt.'
44Ac 7:35 "This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, 'Who made you a ruler and a judge?'--this man God sent as both ruler and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush.
44Ac 7:36 This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years.
44Ac 7:37 This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, 'God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers.'
44Ac 7:38 This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living oracles to give to us.
44Ac 7:39 Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt,
44Ac 7:40 saying to Aaron, 'Make for us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.'
44Ac 7:41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and were rejoicing in the works of their hands.
44Ac 7:42 But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets: "'Did you bring to me slain beasts and sacrifices, during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel?
44Ac 7:43 You took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan, the images that you made to worship; and I will send you into exile beyond Babylon.'
44Ac 7:44 "Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen.
44Ac 7:45 Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our fathers. So it was until the days of David,
44Ac 7:46 who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob.
44Ac 7:47 But it was Solomon who built a house for him.
44Ac 7:48 Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made by hands, as the prophet says,
44Ac 7:49 "'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest?
44Ac 7:50 Did not my hand make all these things?'
44Ac 7:51 "You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you.
44Ac 7:52 Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered,
44Ac 7:53 you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it."
44Ac 7:54 Now when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground their teeth at him.
44Ac 7:55 But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
44Ac 7:56 And he said, "Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God."
44Ac 7:57 But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together at him.
44Ac 7:58 Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul.
44Ac 7:59 And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, "Lord Jesus, receive my spirit."
44Ac 7:60 And falling to his knees he cried out with a loud voice, "Lord, do not hold this sin against them." And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
44Ac 8:1 And Saul approved of his execution. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles.
44Ac 8:2 Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him.
44Ac 8:3 But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison.
44Ac 8:4 Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word.
44Ac 8:5 Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ.
44Ac 8:6 And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip when they heard him and saw the signs that he did.
44Ac 8:7 For unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice, came out of many who had them, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed.
44Ac 8:8 So there was much joy in that city.
44Ac 8:9 But there was a man named Simon, who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great.
44Ac 8:10 They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, "This man is the power of God that is called Great."
44Ac 8:11 And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic.
44Ac 8:12 But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
44Ac 8:13 Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed.
44Ac 8:14 Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John,
44Ac 8:15 who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit,
44Ac 8:16 for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 8:17 Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 8:18 Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles' hands, he offered them money,
44Ac 8:19 saying, "Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit."
44Ac 8:20 But Peter said to him, "May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money!
44Ac 8:21 You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God.
44Ac 8:22 Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you.
44Ac 8:23 For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity."
44Ac 8:24 And Simon answered, "Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me."
44Ac 8:25 Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans.
44Ac 8:26 Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, "Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza." This is a desert place.
44Ac 8:27 And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship
44Ac 8:28 and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah.
44Ac 8:29 And the Spirit said to Philip, "Go over and join this chariot."
44Ac 8:30 So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, "Do you understand what you are reading?"
44Ac 8:31 And he said, "How can I, unless someone guides me?" And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.
44Ac 8:32 Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this: "Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he opens not his mouth.
44Ac 8:33 In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth."
44Ac 8:34 And the eunuch said to Philip, "About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else?"
44Ac 8:35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus.
44Ac 8:36 And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, "See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized?"
44Ac 8:37 (none)
44Ac 8:38 And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him.
44Ac 8:39 And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing.
44Ac 8:40 But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea.
44Ac 9:1 But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest
44Ac 9:2 and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem.
44Ac 9:3 Now as he went on his way, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven flashed around him.
44Ac 9:4 And falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?"
44Ac 9:5 And he said, "Who are you, Lord?" And he said, "I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting.
44Ac 9:6 But rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do."
44Ac 9:7 The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one.
44Ac 9:8 Saul rose from the ground, and although his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus.
44Ac 9:9 And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank.
44Ac 9:10 Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, "Ananias." And he said, "Here I am, Lord."
44Ac 9:11 And the Lord said to him, "Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying,
44Ac 9:12 and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight."
44Ac 9:13 But Ananias answered, "Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem.
44Ac 9:14 And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name."
44Ac 9:15 But the Lord said to him, "Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel.
44Ac 9:16 For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name."
44Ac 9:17 So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, "Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit."
44Ac 9:18 And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized;
44Ac 9:19 and taking food, he was strengthened. For some days he was with the disciples at Damascus.
44Ac 9:20 And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, "He is the Son of God."
44Ac 9:21 And all who heard him were amazed and said, "Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name? And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests?"
44Ac 9:22 But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ.
44Ac 9:23 When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him,
44Ac 9:24 but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him,
44Ac 9:25 but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket.
44Ac 9:26 And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple.
44Ac 9:27 But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus.
44Ac 9:28 So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord.
44Ac 9:29 And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists. But they were seeking to kill him.
44Ac 9:30 And when the brothers learned this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus.
44Ac 9:31 So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it multiplied.
44Ac 9:32 Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda.
44Ac 9:33 There he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, who was paralyzed.
44Ac 9:34 And Peter said to him, "Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed." And immediately he rose.
44Ac 9:35 And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord.
44Ac 9:36 Now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity.
44Ac 9:37 In those days she became ill and died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room.
44Ac 9:38 Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, "Please come to us without delay."
44Ac 9:39 So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them.
44Ac 9:40 But Peter put them all outside, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, "Tabitha, arise." And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up.
44Ac 9:41 And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive.
44Ac 9:42 And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord.
44Ac 9:43 And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner.
44Ac 10:1 At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort,
44Ac 10:2 a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms generously to the people, and prayed continually to God.
44Ac 10:3 About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, "Cornelius."
44Ac 10:4 And he stared at him in terror and said, "What is it, Lord?" And he said to him, "Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God.
44Ac 10:5 And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter.
44Ac 10:6 He is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea."
44Ac 10:7 When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him,
44Ac 10:8 and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa.
44Ac 10:9 The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray.
44Ac 10:10 And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance
44Ac 10:11 and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth.
44Ac 10:12 In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air.
44Ac 10:13 And there came a voice to him: "Rise, Peter; kill and eat."
44Ac 10:14 But Peter said, "By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean."
44Ac 10:15 And the voice came to him again a second time, "What God has made clean, do not call common."
44Ac 10:16 This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven.
44Ac 10:17 Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon's house, stood at the gate
44Ac 10:18 and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there.
44Ac 10:19 And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, "Behold, three men are looking for you.
44Ac 10:20 Rise and go down and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them."
44Ac 10:21 And Peter went down to the men and said, "I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming?"
44Ac 10:22 And they said, "Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God-fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say."
44Ac 10:23 So he invited them in to be his guests. The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him.
44Ac 10:24 And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends.
44Ac 10:25 When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him.
44Ac 10:26 But Peter lifted him up, saying, "Stand up; I too am a man."
44Ac 10:27 And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered.
44Ac 10:28 And he said to them, "You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean.
44Ac 10:29 So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me."
44Ac 10:30 And Cornelius said, "Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing
44Ac 10:31 and said, 'Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God.
44Ac 10:32 Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea.'
44Ac 10:33 So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord."
44Ac 10:34 So Peter opened his mouth and said: "Truly I understand that God shows no partiality,
44Ac 10:35 but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him.
44Ac 10:36 As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ (he is Lord of all),
44Ac 10:37 you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed:
44Ac 10:38 how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him.
44Ac 10:39 And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree,
44Ac 10:40 but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear,
44Ac 10:41 not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead.
44Ac 10:42 And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead.
44Ac 10:43 To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name."
44Ac 10:44 While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word.
44Ac 10:45 And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles.
44Ac 10:46 For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared,
44Ac 10:47 "Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have?"
44Ac 10:48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days.
44Ac 11:1 Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God.
44Ac 11:2 So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying,
44Ac 11:3 "You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them."
44Ac 11:4 But Peter began and explained it to them in order:
44Ac 11:5 "I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me.
44Ac 11:6 Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air.
44Ac 11:7 And I heard a voice saying to me, 'Rise, Peter; kill and eat.'
44Ac 11:8 But I said, 'By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth.'
44Ac 11:9 But the voice answered a second time from heaven, 'What God has made clean, do not call common.'
44Ac 11:10 This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven.
44Ac 11:11 And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea.
44Ac 11:12 And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man's house.
44Ac 11:13 And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, 'Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter;
44Ac 11:14 he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household.'
44Ac 11:15 As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning.
44Ac 11:16 And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, 'John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit.'
44Ac 11:17 If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God's way?"
44Ac 11:18 When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, "Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life."
44Ac 11:19 Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews.
44Ac 11:20 But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 11:21 And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord.
44Ac 11:22 The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch.
44Ac 11:23 When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose,
44Ac 11:24 for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord.
44Ac 11:25 So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul,
44Ac 11:26 and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians.
44Ac 11:27 Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch.
44Ac 11:28 And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world (this took place in the days of Claudius).
44Ac 11:29 So the disciples determined, everyone according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea.
44Ac 11:30 And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul.
44Ac 12:1 About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church.
44Ac 12:2 He killed James the brother of John with the sword,
44Ac 12:3 and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread.
44Ac 12:4 And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people.
44Ac 12:5 So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church.
44Ac 12:6 Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison.
44Ac 12:7 And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, "Get up quickly." And the chains fell off his hands.
44Ac 12:8 And the angel said to him, "Dress yourself and put on your sandals." And he did so. And he said to him, "Wrap your cloak around you and follow me."
44Ac 12:9 And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision.
44Ac 12:10 When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him.
44Ac 12:11 When Peter came to himself, he said, "Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting."
44Ac 12:12 When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying.
44Ac 12:13 And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer.
44Ac 12:14 Recognizing Peter's voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate.
44Ac 12:15 They said to her, "You are out of your mind." But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, "It is his angel!"
44Ac 12:16 But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed.
44Ac 12:17 But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, "Tell these things to James and to the brothers." Then he departed and went to another place.
44Ac 12:18 Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter.
44Ac 12:19 And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there.
44Ac 12:20 Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king's chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king's country for food.
44Ac 12:21 On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and delivered an oration to them.
44Ac 12:22 And the people were shouting, "The voice of a god, and not of a man!"
44Ac 12:23 Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last.
44Ac 12:24 But the word of God increased and multiplied.
44Ac 12:25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had completed their service, bringing with them John, whose other name was Mark.
44Ac 13:1 Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a member of the court of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
44Ac 13:2 While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, "Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them."
44Ac 13:3 Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off.
44Ac 13:4 So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus.
44Ac 13:5 When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them.
44Ac 13:6 When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus.
44Ac 13:7 He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God.
44Ac 13:8 But Elymas the magician (for that is the meaning of his name) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith.
44Ac 13:9 But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him
44Ac 13:10 and said, "You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord?
44Ac 13:11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time." Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand.
44Ac 13:12 Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
44Ac 13:13 Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem,
44Ac 13:14 but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down.
44Ac 13:15 After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, "Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, say it."
44Ac 13:16 So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said: "Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen.
44Ac 13:17 The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it.
44Ac 13:18 And for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness.
44Ac 13:19 And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance.
44Ac 13:20 All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet.
44Ac 13:21 Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years.
44Ac 13:22 And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, 'I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will.'
44Ac 13:23 Of this man's offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised.
44Ac 13:24 Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
44Ac 13:25 And as John was finishing his course, he said, 'What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie.'
44Ac 13:26 "Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation.
44Ac 13:27 For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him.
44Ac 13:28 And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed.
44Ac 13:29 And when they had carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb.
44Ac 13:30 But God raised him from the dead,
44Ac 13:31 and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people.
44Ac 13:32 And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers,
44Ac 13:33 this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, "'You are my Son, today I have begotten you.'
44Ac 13:34 And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way, "'I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David.'
44Ac 13:35 Therefore he says also in another psalm, "'You will not let your Holy One see corruption.'
44Ac 13:36 For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption,
44Ac 13:37 but he whom God raised up did not see corruption.
44Ac 13:38 Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you,
44Ac 13:39 and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses.
44Ac 13:40 Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about:
44Ac 13:41 "'Look, you scoffers, be astounded and perish; for I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you.'"
44Ac 13:42 As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath.
44Ac 13:43 And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God.
44Ac 13:44 The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord.
44Ac 13:45 But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him.
44Ac 13:46 And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, "It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles.
44Ac 13:47 For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, "'I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth.'"
44Ac 13:48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed.
44Ac 13:49 And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region.
44Ac 13:50 But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district.
44Ac 13:51 But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium.
44Ac 13:52 And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit.
44Ac 14:1 Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed.
44Ac 14:2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers.
44Ac 14:3 So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
44Ac 14:4 But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles.
44Ac 14:5 When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them,
44Ac 14:6 they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country,
44Ac 14:7 and there they continued to preach the gospel.
44Ac 14:8 Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet. He was crippled from birth and had never walked.
44Ac 14:9 He listened to Paul speaking. And Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well,
44Ac 14:10 said in a loud voice, "Stand upright on your feet." And he sprang up and began walking.
44Ac 14:11 And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, "The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men!"
44Ac 14:12 Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker.
44Ac 14:13 And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds.
44Ac 14:14 But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out,
44Ac 14:15 "Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men, of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them.
44Ac 14:16 In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways.
44Ac 14:17 Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness."
44Ac 14:18 Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them.
44Ac 14:19 But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead.
44Ac 14:20 But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe.
44Ac 14:21 When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch,
44Ac 14:22 strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God.
44Ac 14:23 And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed.
44Ac 14:24 Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia.
44Ac 14:25 And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia,
44Ac 14:26 and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled.
44Ac 14:27 And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles.
44Ac 14:28 And they remained no little time with the disciples.
44Ac 15:1 But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, "Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved."
44Ac 15:2 And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question.
44Ac 15:3 So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the brothers.
44Ac 15:4 When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them.
44Ac 15:5 But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, "It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses."
44Ac 15:6 The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter.
44Ac 15:7 And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, "Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.
44Ac 15:8 And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us,
44Ac 15:9 and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith.
44Ac 15:10 Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear?
44Ac 15:11 But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will."
44Ac 15:12 And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles.
44Ac 15:13 After they finished speaking, James replied, "Brothers, listen to me.
44Ac 15:14 Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name.
44Ac 15:15 And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written,
44Ac 15:16 "'After this I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it,
44Ac 15:17 that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things
44Ac 15:18 known from of old.'
44Ac 15:19 Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God,
44Ac 15:20 but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood.
44Ac 15:21 For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues."
44Ac 15:22 Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers,
44Ac 15:23 with the following letter: "The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings.
44Ac 15:24 Since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions,
44Ac 15:25 it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
44Ac 15:26 men who have risked their lives for the sake of our Lord Jesus Christ.
44Ac 15:27 We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth.
44Ac 15:28 For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements:
44Ac 15:29 that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell."
44Ac 15:30 So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter.
44Ac 15:31 And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement.
44Ac 15:32 And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words.
44Ac 15:33 And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them.
44Ac 15:34 (none)
44Ac 15:35 But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
44Ac 15:36 And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, "Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are."
44Ac 15:37 Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark.
44Ac 15:38 But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work.
44Ac 15:39 And there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus,
44Ac 15:40 but Paul chose Silas and departed, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord.
44Ac 15:41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches.
44Ac 16:1 Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek.
44Ac 16:2 He was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium.
44Ac 16:3 Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
44Ac 16:4 As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem.
44Ac 16:5 So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily.
44Ac 16:6 And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia.
44Ac 16:7 And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them.
44Ac 16:8 So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas.
44Ac 16:9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us."
44Ac 16:10 And when Paul had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.
44Ac 16:11 So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis,
44Ac 16:12 and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days.
44Ac 16:13 And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together.
44Ac 16:14 One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul.
44Ac 16:15 And after she was baptized, and her household as well, she urged us, saying, "If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay." And she prevailed upon us.
44Ac 16:16 As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling.
44Ac 16:17 She followed Paul and us, crying out, "These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation."
44Ac 16:18 And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, "I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her." And it came out that very hour.
44Ac 16:19 But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers.
44Ac 16:20 And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, "These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city.
44Ac 16:21 They advocate customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to accept or practice."
44Ac 16:22 The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods.
44Ac 16:23 And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely.
44Ac 16:24 Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.
44Ac 16:25 About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them,
44Ac 16:26 and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone's bonds were unfastened.
44Ac 16:27 When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.
44Ac 16:28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, "Do not harm yourself, for we are all here."
44Ac 16:29 And the jailer called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas.
44Ac 16:30 Then he brought them out and said, "Sirs, what must I do to be saved?"
44Ac 16:31 And they said, "Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household."
44Ac 16:32 And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house.
44Ac 16:33 And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family.
44Ac 16:34 Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God.
44Ac 16:35 But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, "Let those men go."
44Ac 16:36 And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, "The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace."
44Ac 16:37 But Paul said to them, "They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out."
44Ac 16:38 The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens.
44Ac 16:39 So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city.
44Ac 16:40 So they went out of the prison and visited Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them and departed.
44Ac 17:1 Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews.
44Ac 17:2 And Paul went in, as was his custom, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures,
44Ac 17:3 explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, "This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ."
44Ac 17:4 And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women.
44Ac 17:5 But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked men of the rabble, they formed a mob, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the crowd.
44Ac 17:6 And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, "These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also,
44Ac 17:7 and Jason has received them, and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus."
44Ac 17:8 And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things.
44Ac 17:9 And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest, they let them go.
44Ac 17:10 The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue.
44Ac 17:11 Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so.
44Ac 17:12 Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men.
44Ac 17:13 But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds.
44Ac 17:14 Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there.
44Ac 17:15 Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed.
44Ac 17:16 Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols.
44Ac 17:17 So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there.
44Ac 17:18 Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, "What does this babbler wish to say?" Others said, "He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities"--because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection.
44Ac 17:19 And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, "May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting?
44Ac 17:20 For you bring some strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean."
44Ac 17:21 Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new.
44Ac 17:22 So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said: "Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious.
44Ac 17:23 For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, 'To the unknown god.' What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you.
44Ac 17:24 The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man,
44Ac 17:25 nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything.
44Ac 17:26 And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place,
44Ac 17:27 that they should seek God, in the hope that they might feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us,
44Ac 17:28 for "'In him we live and move and have our being'; as even some of your own poets have said, "'For we are indeed his offspring.'
44Ac 17:29 Being then God's offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man.
44Ac 17:30 The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent,
44Ac 17:31 because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead."
44Ac 17:32 Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. But others said, "We will hear you again about this."
44Ac 17:33 So Paul went out from their midst.
44Ac 17:34 But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them.
44Ac 18:1 After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth.
44Ac 18:2 And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. And he went to see them,
44Ac 18:3 and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade.
44Ac 18:4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and tried to persuade Jews and Greeks.
44Ac 18:5 When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with the word, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus.
44Ac 18:6 And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, "Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles."
44Ac 18:7 And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. His house was next door to the synagogue.
44Ac 18:8 Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire household. And many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized.
44Ac 18:9 And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, "Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent,
44Ac 18:10 for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people."
44Ac 18:11 And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
44Ac 18:12 But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him before the tribunal,
44Ac 18:13 saying, "This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law."
44Ac 18:14 But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, "If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, I would have reason to accept your complaint.
44Ac 18:15 But since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of these things."
44Ac 18:16 And he drove them from the tribunal.
44Ac 18:17 And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this.
44Ac 18:18 After this, Paul stayed many days longer and then took leave of the brothers and set sail for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he had cut his hair, for he was under a vow.
44Ac 18:19 And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there, but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews.
44Ac 18:20 When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined.
44Ac 18:21 But on taking leave of them he said, "I will return to you if God wills," and he set sail from Ephesus.
44Ac 18:22 When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch.
44Ac 18:23 After spending some time there, he departed and went from one place to the next through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples.
44Ac 18:24 Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, competent in the Scriptures.
44Ac 18:25 He had been instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John.
44Ac 18:26 He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him and explained to him the way of God more accurately.
44Ac 18:27 And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed,
44Ac 18:28 for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus.
44Ac 19:1 And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples.
44Ac 19:2 And he said to them, "Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed?" And they said, "No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit."
44Ac 19:3 And he said, "Into what then were you baptized?" They said, "Into John's baptism."
44Ac 19:4 And Paul said, "John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus."
44Ac 19:5 On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
44Ac 19:6 And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying.
44Ac 19:7 There were about twelve men in all.
44Ac 19:8 And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God.
44Ac 19:9 But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus.
44Ac 19:10 This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
44Ac 19:11 And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul,
44Ac 19:12 so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them.
44Ac 19:13 Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, "I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims."
44Ac 19:14 Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this.
44Ac 19:15 But the evil spirit answered them, "Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you?"
44Ac 19:16 And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
44Ac 19:17 And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled.
44Ac 19:18 Also many of those who were now believers came, confessing and divulging their practices.
44Ac 19:19 And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver.
44Ac 19:20 So the word of the Lord continued to increase and prevail mightily.
44Ac 19:21 Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, "After I have been there, I must also see Rome."
44Ac 19:22 And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while.
44Ac 19:23 About that time there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way.
44Ac 19:24 For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen.
44Ac 19:25 These he gathered together, with the workmen in similar trades, and said, "Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth.
44Ac 19:26 And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods.
44Ac 19:27 And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship."
44Ac 19:28 When they heard this they were enraged and were crying out, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44Ac 19:29 So the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul's companions in travel.
44Ac 19:30 But when Paul wished to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him.
44Ac 19:31 And even some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of his, sent to him and were urging him not to venture into the theater.
44Ac 19:32 Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together.
44Ac 19:33 Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd.
44Ac 19:34 But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all cried out with one voice, "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians!"
44Ac 19:35 And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, "Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky?
44Ac 19:36 Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash.
44Ac 19:37 For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess.
44Ac 19:38 If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another.
44Ac 19:39 But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly.
44Ac 19:40 For we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion."
44Ac 19:41 And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly.
44Ac 20:1 After the uproar ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and after encouraging them, he said farewell and departed for Macedonia.
44Ac 20:2 When he had gone through those regions and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece.
44Ac 20:3 There he spent three months, and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia.
44Ac 20:4 Sopater the Berean, son of Pyrrhus, accompanied him; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus.
44Ac 20:5 These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas,
44Ac 20:6 but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we came to them at Troas, where we stayed for seven days.
44Ac 20:7 On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight.
44Ac 20:8 There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered.
44Ac 20:9 And a young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer. And being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead.
44Ac 20:10 But Paul went down and bent over him, and taking him in his arms, said, "Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him."
44Ac 20:11 And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed.
44Ac 20:12 And they took the youth away alive, and were not a little comforted.
44Ac 20:13 But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land.
44Ac 20:14 And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene.
44Ac 20:15 And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios; the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after that we went to Miletus.
44Ac 20:16 For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost.
44Ac 20:17 Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him.
44Ac 20:18 And when they came to him, he said to them: "You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia,
44Ac 20:19 serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews;
44Ac 20:20 how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house,
44Ac 20:21 testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.
44Ac 20:22 And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there,
44Ac 20:23 except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me.
44Ac 20:24 But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God.
44Ac 20:25 And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again.
44Ac 20:26 Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all of you,
44Ac 20:27 for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.
44Ac 20:28 Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood.
44Ac 20:29 I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock;
44Ac 20:30 and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them.
44Ac 20:31 Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish everyone with tears.
44Ac 20:32 And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified.
44Ac 20:33 I coveted no one's silver or gold or apparel.
44Ac 20:34 You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me.
44Ac 20:35 In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, 'It is more blessed to give than to receive.'"
44Ac 20:36 And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all.
44Ac 20:37 And there was much weeping on the part of all; they embraced Paul and kissed him,
44Ac 20:38 being sorrowful most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they accompanied him to the ship.
44Ac 21:1 And when we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.
44Ac 21:2 And having found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail.
44Ac 21:3 When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload its cargo.
44Ac 21:4 And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. And through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:5 When our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey, and they all, with wives and children, accompanied us until we were outside the city. And kneeling down on the beach, we prayed
44Ac 21:6 and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.
44Ac 21:7 When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day.
44Ac 21:8 On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him.
44Ac 21:9 He had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied.
44Ac 21:10 While we were staying for many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea.
44Ac 21:11 And coming to us, he took Paul's belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, "Thus says the Holy Spirit, 'This is how the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.'"
44Ac 21:12 When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:13 Then Paul answered, "What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus."
44Ac 21:14 And since he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, "Let the will of the Lord be done."
44Ac 21:15 After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem.
44Ac 21:16 And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.
44Ac 21:17 When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly.
44Ac 21:18 On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present.
44Ac 21:19 After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry.
44Ac 21:20 And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, "You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all zealous for the law,
44Ac 21:21 and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs.
44Ac 21:22 What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come.
44Ac 21:23 Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow;
44Ac 21:24 take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live in observance of the law.
44Ac 21:25 But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality."
44Ac 21:26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself along with them and went into the temple, giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for each one of them.
44Ac 21:27 When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him,
44Ac 21:28 crying out, "Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place. Moreover, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place."
44Ac 21:29 For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple.
44Ac 21:30 Then all the city was stirred up, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut.
44Ac 21:31 And as they were seeking to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion.
44Ac 21:32 He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul.
44Ac 21:33 Then the tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done.
44Ac 21:34 Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another. And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks.
44Ac 21:35 And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd,
44Ac 21:36 for the mob of the people followed, crying out, "Away with him!"
44Ac 21:37 As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, "May I say something to you?" And he said, "Do you know Greek?
44Ac 21:38 Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?"
44Ac 21:39 Paul replied, "I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city. I beg you, permit me to speak to the people."
44Ac 21:40 And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying:
44Ac 22:1 "Brothers and fathers, hear the defense that I now make before you."
44Ac 22:2 And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they became even more quiet. And he said:
44Ac 22:3 "I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day.
44Ac 22:4 I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women,
44Ac 22:5 as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished.
44Ac 22:6 "As I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me.
44Ac 22:7 And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?'
44Ac 22:8 And I answered, 'Who are you, Lord?' And he said to me, 'I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting.'
44Ac 22:9 Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me.
44Ac 22:10 And I said, 'What shall I do, Lord?' And the Lord said to me, 'Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do.'
44Ac 22:11 And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus.
44Ac 22:12 "And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there,
44Ac 22:13 came to me, and standing by me said to me, 'Brother Saul, receive your sight.' And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him.
44Ac 22:14 And he said, 'The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth;
44Ac 22:15 for you will be a witness for him to everyone of what you have seen and heard.
44Ac 22:16 And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name.'
44Ac 22:17 "When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance
44Ac 22:18 and saw him saying to me, 'Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me.'
44Ac 22:19 And I said, 'Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you.
44Ac 22:20 And when the blood of Stephen your witness was being shed, I myself was standing by and approving and watching over the garments of those who killed him.'
44Ac 22:21 And he said to me, 'Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles.'"
44Ac 22:22 Up to this word they listened to him. Then they raised their voices and said, "Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live."
44Ac 22:23 And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air,
44Ac 22:24 the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying that he should be examined by flogging, to find out why they were shouting against him like this.
44Ac 22:25 But when they had stretched him out for the whips, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, "Is it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned?"
44Ac 22:26 When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, "What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen."
44Ac 22:27 So the tribune came and said to him, "Tell me, are you a Roman citizen?" And he said, "Yes."
44Ac 22:28 The tribune answered, "I bought this citizenship for a large sum." Paul said, "But I am a citizen by birth."
44Ac 22:29 So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately, and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him.
44Ac 22:30 But on the next day, desiring to know the real reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them.
44Ac 23:1 And looking intently at the council, Paul said, "Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day."
44Ac 23:2 And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth.
44Ac 23:3 Then Paul said to him, "God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck?"
44Ac 23:4 Those who stood by said, "Would you revile God's high priest?"
44Ac 23:5 And Paul said, "I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, 'You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people.'"
44Ac 23:6 Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, "Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial."
44Ac 23:7 And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided.
44Ac 23:8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all.
44Ac 23:9 Then a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees' party stood up and contended sharply, "We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him?"
44Ac 23:10 And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks.
44Ac 23:11 The following night the Lord stood by him and said, "Take courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome."
44Ac 23:12 When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
44Ac 23:13 There were more than forty who made this conspiracy.
44Ac 23:14 They went to the chief priests and elders and said, "We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul.
44Ac 23:15 Now therefore you, along with the council, give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near."
44Ac 23:16 Now the son of Paul's sister heard of their ambush, so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul.
44Ac 23:17 Paul called one of the centurions and said, "Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him."
44Ac 23:18 So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, "Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you."
44Ac 23:19 The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, "What is it that you have to tell me?"
44Ac 23:20 And he said, "The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him.
44Ac 23:21 But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for your consent."
44Ac 23:22 So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, "Tell no one that you have informed me of these things."
44Ac 23:23 Then he called two of the centurions and said, "Get ready two hundred soldiers, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night.
44Ac 23:24 Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor."
44Ac 23:25 And he wrote a letter to this effect:
44Ac 23:26 "Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency the governor Felix, greetings.
44Ac 23:27 This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen.
44Ac 23:28 And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council.
44Ac 23:29 I found that he was being accused about questions of their law, but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment.
44Ac 23:30 And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him."
44Ac 23:31 So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris.
44Ac 23:32 And on the next day they returned to the barracks, letting the horsemen go on with him.
44Ac 23:33 When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him.
44Ac 23:34 On reading the letter, he asked what province he was from. And when he learned that he was from Cilicia,
44Ac 23:35 he said, "I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive." And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod's praetorium.
44Ac 24:1 And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertullus. They laid before the governor their case against Paul.
44Ac 24:2 And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying: "Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation,
44Ac 24:3 in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude.
44Ac 24:4 But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly.
44Ac 24:5 For we have found this man a plague, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes.
44Ac 24:6 He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him.
44Ac 24:7 (none)
44Ac 24:8 By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him."
44Ac 24:9 The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so.
44Ac 24:10 And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied: "Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense.
44Ac 24:11 You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem,
44Ac 24:12 and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city.
44Ac 24:13 Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me.
44Ac 24:14 But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets,
44Ac 24:15 having a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust.
44Ac 24:16 So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man.
44Ac 24:17 Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings.
44Ac 24:18 While I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But some Jews from Asia--
44Ac 24:19 they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, should they have anything against me.
44Ac 24:20 Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council,
44Ac 24:21 other than this one thing that I cried out while standing among them: 'It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day.'"
44Ac 24:22 But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, "When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case."
44Ac 24:23 Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs.
44Ac 24:24 After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus.
44Ac 24:25 And as he reasoned about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, "Go away for the present. When I get an opportunity I will summon you."
44Ac 24:26 At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him.
44Ac 24:27 When two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison.
44Ac 25:1 Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea.
44Ac 25:2 And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul, and they urged him,
44Ac 25:3 asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalem--because they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way.
44Ac 25:4 Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly.
44Ac 25:5 "So," said he, "let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him."
44Ac 25:6 After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought.
44Ac 25:7 When he had arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him that they could not prove.
44Ac 25:8 Paul argued in his defense, "Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I committed any offense."
44Ac 25:9 But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, "Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me?"
44Ac 25:10 But Paul said, "I am standing before Caesar's tribunal, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you yourself know very well.
44Ac 25:11 If then I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not seek to escape death. But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar."
44Ac 25:12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, "To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go."
44Ac 25:13 Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus.
44Ac 25:14 And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul's case before the king, saying, "There is a man left prisoner by Felix,
44Ac 25:15 and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him.
44Ac 25:16 I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him.
44Ac 25:17 So when they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought.
44Ac 25:18 When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed.
44Ac 25:19 Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive.
44Ac 25:20 Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them.
44Ac 25:21 But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar."
44Ac 25:22 Then Agrippa said to Festus, "I would like to hear the man myself." "Tomorrow," said he, "you will hear him."
44Ac 25:23 So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in.
44Ac 25:24 And Festus said, "King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer.
44Ac 25:25 But I found that he had done nothing deserving death. And as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to go ahead and send him.
44Ac 25:26 But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write.
44Ac 25:27 For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him."
44Ac 26:1 So Agrippa said to Paul, "You have permission to speak for yourself." Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense:
44Ac 26:2 "I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am going to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews,
44Ac 26:3 especially because you are familiar with all the customs and controversies of the Jews. Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently.
44Ac 26:4 "My manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews.
44Ac 26:5 They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee.
44Ac 26:6 And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our fathers,
44Ac 26:7 to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope I am accused by Jews, O king!
44Ac 26:8 Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead?
44Ac 26:9 "I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
44Ac 26:10 And I did so in Jerusalem. I not only locked up many of the saints in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them.
44Ac 26:11 And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme, and in raging fury against them I persecuted them even to foreign cities.
44Ac 26:12 "In this connection I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests.
44Ac 26:13 At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, that shone around me and those who journeyed with me.
44Ac 26:14 And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, 'Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads.'
44Ac 26:15 And I said, 'Who are you, Lord?' And the Lord said, 'I am Jesus whom you are persecuting.
44Ac 26:16 But rise and stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you,
44Ac 26:17 delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles--to whom I am sending you
44Ac 26:18 to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me.'
44Ac 26:19 "Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision,
44Ac 26:20 but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance.
44Ac 26:21 For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me.
44Ac 26:22 To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass:
44Ac 26:23 that the Christ must suffer and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles."
44Ac 26:24 And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, "Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind."
44Ac 26:25 But Paul said, "I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words.
44Ac 26:26 For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner.
44Ac 26:27 King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe."
44Ac 26:28 And Agrippa said to Paul, "In a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian?"
44Ac 26:29 And Paul said, "Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am--except for these chains."
44Ac 26:30 Then the king rose, and the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them.
44Ac 26:31 And when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, "This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment."
44Ac 26:32 And Agrippa said to Festus, "This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar."
44Ac 27:1 And when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort named Julius.
44Ac 27:2 And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica.
44Ac 27:3 The next day we put in at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for.
44Ac 27:4 And putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us.
44Ac 27:5 And when we had sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia.
44Ac 27:6 There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board.
44Ac 27:7 We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone.
44Ac 27:8 Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea.
44Ac 27:9 Since much time had passed, and the voyage was now dangerous because even the Fast was already over, Paul advised them,
44Ac 27:10 saying, "Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives."
44Ac 27:11 But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said.
44Ac 27:12 And because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing both southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there.
44Ac 27:13 Now when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore.
44Ac 27:14 But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, struck down from the land.
44Ac 27:15 And when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along.
44Ac 27:16 Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with difficulty to secure the ship's boat.
44Ac 27:17 After hoisting it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. Then, fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and thus they were driven along.
44Ac 27:18 Since we were violently storm-tossed, they began the next day to jettison the cargo.
44Ac 27:19 And on the third day they threw the ship's tackle overboard with their own hands.
44Ac 27:20 When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned.
44Ac 27:21 Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, "Men, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss.
44Ac 27:22 Yet now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
44Ac 27:23 For this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship,
44Ac 27:24 and he said, 'Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you.'
44Ac 27:25 So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told.
44Ac 27:26 But we must run aground on some island."
44Ac 27:27 When the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land.
44Ac 27:28 So they took a sounding and found twenty fathoms. A little farther on they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms.
44Ac 27:29 And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come.
44Ac 27:30 And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the ship's boat into the sea under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow,
44Ac 27:31 Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, "Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved."
44Ac 27:32 Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship's boat and let it go.
44Ac 27:33 As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, "Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing.
44Ac 27:34 Therefore I urge you to take some food. For it will give you strength, for not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you."
44Ac 27:35 And when he had said these things, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat.
44Ac 27:36 Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves.
44Ac 27:37 (We were in all 276 persons in the ship.)
44Ac 27:38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea.
44Ac 27:39 Now when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned if possible to run the ship ashore.
44Ac 27:40 So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders. Then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach.
44Ac 27:41 But striking a reef, they ran the vessel aground. The bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was being broken up by the surf.
44Ac 27:42 The soldiers' plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape.
44Ac 27:43 But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land,
44Ac 27:44 and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land.
44Ac 28:1 After we were brought safely through, we then learned that the island was called Malta.
44Ac 28:2 The native people showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold.
44Ac 28:3 When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand.
44Ac 28:4 When the native people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, "No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live."
44Ac 28:5 He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm.
44Ac 28:6 They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god.
44Ac 28:7 Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days.
44Ac 28:8 It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him healed him.
44Ac 28:9 And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured.
44Ac 28:10 They also honored us greatly, and when we were about to sail, they put on board whatever we needed.
44Ac 28:11 After three months we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the twin gods as a figurehead.
44Ac 28:12 Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days.
44Ac 28:13 And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli.
44Ac 28:14 There we found brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome.
44Ac 28:15 And the brothers there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage.
44Ac 28:16 And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier that guarded him.
44Ac 28:17 After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews, and when they had gathered, he said to them, "Brothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
44Ac 28:18 When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case.
44Ac 28:19 But because the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar--though I had no charge to bring against my nation.
44Ac 28:20 For this reason, therefore, I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am wearing this chain."
44Ac 28:21 And they said to him, "We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you.
44Ac 28:22 But we desire to hear from you what your views are, for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against."
44Ac 28:23 When they had appointed a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in greater numbers. From morning till evening he expounded to them, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets.
44Ac 28:24 And some were convinced by what he said, but others disbelieved.
44Ac 28:25 And disagreeing among themselves, they departed after Paul had made one statement: "The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet:
44Ac 28:26 "'Go to this people, and say, You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive.
44Ac 28:27 For this people's heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.'
44Ac 28:28 Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen."
44Ac 28:29 (none)
44Ac 28:30 He lived there two whole years at his own expense, and welcomed all who came to him,
44Ac 28:31 proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance.
45
45Rm 1:1 Paul, a servant of Christ Jesus, called to be an apostle, set apart for the gospel of God,
45Rm 1:2 which he promised beforehand through his prophets in the holy Scriptures,
45Rm 1:3 concerning his Son, who was descended from David according to the flesh
45Rm 1:4 and was declared to be the Son of God in power according to the Spirit of holiness by his resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ our Lord,
45Rm 1:5 through whom we have received grace and apostleship to bring about the obedience of faith for the sake of his name among all the nations,
45Rm 1:6 including you who are called to belong to Jesus Christ,
45Rm 1:7 To all those in Rome who are loved by God and called to be saints: Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
45Rm 1:8 First, I thank my God through Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world.
45Rm 1:9 For God is my witness, whom I serve with my spirit in the gospel of his Son, that without ceasing I mention you
45Rm 1:10 always in my prayers, asking that somehow by God's will I may now at last succeed in coming to you.
45Rm 1:11 For I long to see you, that I may impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you--
45Rm 1:12 that is, that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine.
45Rm 1:13 I want you to know, brothers, that I have often intended to come to you (but thus far have been prevented), in order that I may reap some harvest among you as well as among the rest of the Gentiles.
45Rm 1:14 I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish.
45Rm 1:15 So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome.
45Rm 1:16 For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek.
45Rm 1:17 For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith for faith, as it is written, "The righteous shall live by faith."
45Rm 1:18 For the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, who by their unrighteousness suppress the truth.
45Rm 1:19 For what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them.
45Rm 1:20 For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world, in the things that have been made. So they are without excuse.
45Rm 1:21 For although they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks to him, but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened.
45Rm 1:22 Claiming to be wise, they became fools,
45Rm 1:23 and exchanged the glory of the immortal God for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things.
45Rm 1:24 Therefore God gave them up in the lusts of their hearts to impurity, to the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves,
45Rm 1:25 because they exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever! Amen.
45Rm 1:26 For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature;
45Rm 1:27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another, men committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty for their error.
45Rm 1:28 And since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.
45Rm 1:29 They were filled with all manner of unrighteousness, evil, covetousness, malice. They are full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, maliciousness. They are gossips,
45Rm 1:30 slanderers, haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents,
45Rm 1:31 foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless.
45Rm 1:32 Though they know God's decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they not only do them but give approval to those who practice them.
45Rm 2:1 Therefore you have no excuse, O man, every one of you who judges. For in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself, because you, the judge, practice the very same things.
45Rm 2:2 We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things.
45Rm 2:3 Do you suppose, O man--you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself--that you will escape the judgment of God?
45Rm 2:4 Or do you presume on the riches of his kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance?
45Rm 2:5 But because of your hard and impenitent heart you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed.
45Rm 2:6 He will render to each one according to his works:
45Rm 2:7 to those who by patience in well-doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life;
45Rm 2:8 but for those who are self-seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury.
45Rm 2:9 There will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek,
45Rm 2:10 but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first and also the Greek.
45Rm 2:11 For God shows no partiality.
45Rm 2:12 For all who have sinned without the law will also perish without the law, and all who have sinned under the law will be judged by the law.
45Rm 2:13 For it is not the hearers of the law who are righteous before God, but the doers of the law who will be justified.
45Rm 2:14 For when Gentiles, who do not have the law, by nature do what the law requires, they are a law to themselves, even though they do not have the law.
45Rm 2:15 They show that the work of the law is written on their hearts, while their conscience also bears witness, and their conflicting thoughts accuse or even excuse them
45Rm 2:16 on that day when, according to my gospel, God judges the secrets of men by Christ Jesus.
45Rm 2:17 But if you call yourself a Jew and rely on the law and boast in God
45Rm 2:18 and know his will and approve what is excellent, because you are instructed from the law;
45Rm 2:19 and if you are sure that you yourself are a guide to the blind, a light to those who are in darkness,
45Rm 2:20 an instructor of the foolish, a teacher of children, having in the law the embodiment of knowledge and truth--
45Rm 2:21 you then who teach others, do you not teach yourself? While you preach against stealing, do you steal?
45Rm 2:22 You who say that one must not commit adultery, do you commit adultery? You who abhor idols, do you rob temples?
45Rm 2:23 You who boast in the law dishonor God by breaking the law.
45Rm 2:24 For, as it is written, "The name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles because of you."
45Rm 2:25 For circumcision indeed is of value if you obey the law, but if you break the law, your circumcision becomes uncircumcision.
45Rm 2:26 So, if a man who is uncircumcised keeps the precepts of the law, will not his uncircumcision be regarded as circumcision?
45Rm 2:27 Then he who is physically uncircumcised but keeps the law will condemn you who have the written code and circumcision but break the law.
45Rm 2:28 For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, nor is circumcision outward and physical.
45Rm 2:29 But a Jew is one inwardly, and circumcision is a matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man but from God.
45Rm 3:1 Then what advantage has the Jew? Or what is the value of circumcision?
45Rm 3:2 Much in every way. To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.
45Rm 3:3 What if some were unfaithful? Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God?
45Rm 3:4 By no means! Let God be true though every one were a liar, as it is written, "That you may be justified in your words, and prevail when you are judged."
45Rm 3:5 But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? (I speak in a human way.)
45Rm 3:6 By no means! For then how could God judge the world?
45Rm 3:7 But if through my lie God's truth abounds to his glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner?
45Rm 3:8 And why not do evil that good may come?--as some people slanderously charge us with saying. Their condemnation is just.
45Rm 3:9 What then? Are we Jews any better off? No, not at all. For we have already charged that all, both Jews and Greeks, are under sin,
45Rm 3:10 as it is written: "None is righteous, no, not one;
45Rm 3:11 no one understands; no one seeks for God.
45Rm 3:12 All have turned aside; together they have become worthless; no one does good, not even one."
45Rm 3:13 "Their throat is an open grave; they use their tongues to deceive." "The venom of asps is under their lips."
45Rm 3:14 "Their mouth is full of curses and bitterness."
45Rm 3:15 "Their feet are swift to shed blood;
45Rm 3:16 in their paths are ruin and misery,
45Rm 3:17 and the way of peace they have not known."
45Rm 3:18 "There is no fear of God before their eyes."
45Rm 3:19 Now we know that whatever the law says it speaks to those who are under the law, so that every mouth may be stopped, and the whole world may be held accountable to God.
45Rm 3:20 For by works of the law no human being will be justified in his sight, since through the law comes knowledge of sin.
45Rm 3:21 But now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the Law and the Prophets bear witness to it--
45Rm 3:22 the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ for all who believe. For there is no distinction:
45Rm 3:23 for all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God,
45Rm 3:24 and are justified by his grace as a gift, through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus,
45Rm 3:25 whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness, because in his divine forbearance he had passed over former sins.
45Rm 3:26 It was to show his righteousness at the present time, so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.
45Rm 3:27 Then what becomes of our boasting? It is excluded. By what kind of law? By a law of works? No, but by the law of faith.
45Rm 3:28 For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.
45Rm 3:29 Or is God the God of Jews only? Is he not the God of Gentiles also? Yes, of Gentiles also,
45Rm 3:30 since God is one--who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith.
45Rm 3:31 Do we then overthrow the law by this faith? By no means! On the contrary, we uphold the law.
45Rm 4:1 What then shall we say was gained by Abraham, our forefather according to the flesh?
45Rm 4:2 For if Abraham was justified by works, he has something to boast about, but not before God.
45Rm 4:3 For what does the Scripture say? "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness."
45Rm 4:4 Now to the one who works, his wages are not counted as a gift but as his due.
45Rm 4:5 And to the one who does not work but believes in him who justifies the ungodly, his faith is counted as righteousness,
45Rm 4:6 just as David also speaks of the blessing of the one to whom God counts righteousness apart from works:
45Rm 4:7 "Blessed are those whose lawless deeds are forgiven, and whose sins are covered;
45Rm 4:8 blessed is the man against whom the Lord will not count his sin."
45Rm 4:9 Is this blessing then only for the circumcised, or also for the uncircumcised? We say that faith was counted to Abraham as righteousness.
45Rm 4:10 How then was it counted to him? Was it before or after he had been circumcised? It was not after, but before he was circumcised.
45Rm 4:11 He received the sign of circumcision as a seal of the righteousness that he had by faith while he was still uncircumcised. The purpose was to make him the father of all who believe without being circumcised, so that righteousness would be counted to them as well,
45Rm 4:12 and to make him the father of the circumcised who are not merely circumcised but who also walk in the footsteps of the faith that our father Abraham had before he was circumcised.
45Rm 4:13 For the promise to Abraham and his offspring that he would be heir of the world did not come through the law but through the righteousness of faith.
45Rm 4:14 For if it is the adherents of the law who are to be the heirs, faith is null and the promise is void.
45Rm 4:15 For the law brings wrath, but where there is no law there is no transgression.
45Rm 4:16 That is why it depends on faith, in order that the promise may rest on grace and be guaranteed to all his offspring--not only to the adherent of the law but also to the one who shares the faith of Abraham, who is the father of us all,
45Rm 4:17 as it is written, "I have made you the father of many nations"--in the presence of the God in whom he believed, who gives life to the dead and calls into existence the things that do not exist.
45Rm 4:18 In hope he believed against hope, that he should become the father of many nations, as he had been told, "So shall your offspring be."
45Rm 4:19 He did not weaken in faith when he considered his own body, which was as good as dead (since he was about a hundred years old), or when he considered the barrenness of Sarah's womb.
45Rm 4:20 No distrust made him waver concerning the promise of God, but he grew strong in his faith as he gave glory to God,
45Rm 4:21 fully convinced that God was able to do what he had promised.
45Rm 4:22 That is why his faith was "counted to him as righteousness."
45Rm 4:23 But the words "it was counted to him" were not written for his sake alone,
45Rm 4:24 but for ours also. It will be counted to us who believe in him who raised from the dead Jesus our Lord,
45Rm 4:25 who was delivered up for our trespasses and raised for our justification.
45Rm 5:1 Therefore, since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ.
45Rm 5:2 Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope of the glory of God.
45Rm 5:3 More than that, we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance,
45Rm 5:4 and endurance produces character, and character produces hope,
45Rm 5:5 and hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us.
45Rm 5:6 For while we were still weak, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
45Rm 5:7 For one will scarcely die for a righteous person--though perhaps for a good person one would dare even to die--
45Rm 5:8 but God shows his love for us in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.
45Rm 5:9 Since, therefore, we have now been justified by his blood, much more shall we be saved by him from the wrath of God.
45Rm 5:10 For if while we were enemies we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more, now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by his life.
45Rm 5:11 More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation.
45Rm 5:12 Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and so death spread to all men because all sinned--
45Rm 5:13 for sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law.
45Rm 5:14 Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.
45Rm 5:15 But the free gift is not like the trespass. For if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man Jesus Christ abounded for many.
45Rm 5:16 And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification.
45Rm 5:17 For if, because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man Jesus Christ.
45Rm 5:18 Therefore, as one trespass led to condemnation for all men, so one act of righteousness leads to justification and life for all men.
45Rm 5:19 For as by the one man's disobedience the many were made sinners, so by the one man's obedience the many will be made righteous.
45Rm 5:20 Now the law came in to increase the trespass, but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more,
45Rm 5:21 so that, as sin reigned in death, grace also might reign through righteousness leading to eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord.
45Rm 6:1 What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
45Rm 6:2 By no means! How can we who died to sin still live in it?
45Rm 6:3 Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death?
45Rm 6:4 We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life.
45Rm 6:5 For if we have been united with him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with him in a resurrection like his.
45Rm 6:6 We know that our old self was crucified with him in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin.
45Rm 6:7 For one who has died has been set free from sin.
45Rm 6:8 Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with him.
45Rm 6:9 We know that Christ, being raised from the dead, will never die again; death no longer has dominion over him.
45Rm 6:10 For the death he died he died to sin, once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God.
45Rm 6:11 So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus.
45Rm 6:12 Let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body, to make you obey its passions.
45Rm 6:13 Do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness.
45Rm 6:14 For sin will have no dominion over you, since you are not under law but under grace.
45Rm 6:15 What then? Are we to sin because we are not under law but under grace? By no means!
45Rm 6:16 Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves of the one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or of obedience, which leads to righteousness?
45Rm 6:17 But thanks be to God, that you who were once slaves of sin have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you were committed,
45Rm 6:18 and, having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness.
45Rm 6:19 I am speaking in human terms, because of your natural limitations. For just as you once presented your members as slaves to impurity and to lawlessness leading to more lawlessness, so now present your members as slaves to righteousness leading to sanctification.
45Rm 6:20 For when you were slaves of sin, you were free in regard to righteousness.
45Rm 6:21 But what fruit were you getting at that time from the things of which you are now ashamed? For the end of those things is death.
45Rm 6:22 But now that you have been set free from sin and have become slaves of God, the fruit you get leads to sanctification and its end, eternal life.
45Rm 6:23 For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45Rm 7:1 Or do you not know, brothers--for I am speaking to those who know the law--that the law is binding on a person only as long as he lives?
45Rm 7:2 For a married woman is bound by law to her husband while he lives, but if her husband dies she is released from the law of marriage.
45Rm 7:3 Accordingly, she will be called an adulteress if she lives with another man while her husband is alive. But if her husband dies, she is free from that law, and if she marries another man she is not an adulteress.
45Rm 7:4 Likewise, my brothers, you also have died to the law through the body of Christ, so that you may belong to another, to him who has been raised from the dead, in order that we may bear fruit for God.
45Rm 7:5 For while we were living in the flesh, our sinful passions, aroused by the law, were at work in our members to bear fruit for death.
45Rm 7:6 But now we are released from the law, having died to that which held us captive, so that we serve in the new way of the Spirit and not in the old way of the written code.
45Rm 7:7 What then shall we say? That the law is sin? By no means! Yet if it had not been for the law, I would not have known sin. For I would not have known what it is to covet if the law had not said, "You shall not covet."
45Rm 7:8 But sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, produced in me all kinds of covetousness. For apart from the law, sin lies dead.
45Rm 7:9 I was once alive apart from the law, but when the commandment came, sin came alive and I died.
45Rm 7:10 The very commandment that promised life proved to be death to me.
45Rm 7:11 For sin, seizing an opportunity through the commandment, deceived me and through it killed me.
45Rm 7:12 So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy and righteous and good.
45Rm 7:13 Did that which is good, then, bring death to me? By no means! It was sin, producing death in me through what is good, in order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through the commandment might become sinful beyond measure.
45Rm 7:14 For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am of the flesh, sold under sin.
45Rm 7:15 For I do not understand my own actions. For I do not do what I want, but I do the very thing I hate.
45Rm 7:16 Now if I do what I do not want, I agree with the law, that it is good.
45Rm 7:17 So now it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.
45Rm 7:18 For I know that nothing good dwells in me, that is, in my flesh. For I have the desire to do what is right, but not the ability to carry it out.
45Rm 7:19 For I do not do the good I want, but the evil I do not want is what I keep on doing.
45Rm 7:20 Now if I do what I do not want, it is no longer I who do it, but sin that dwells within me.
45Rm 7:21 So I find it to be a law that when I want to do right, evil lies close at hand.
45Rm 7:22 For I delight in the law of God, in my inner being,
45Rm 7:23 but I see in my members another law waging war against the law of my mind and making me captive to the law of sin that dwells in my members.
45Rm 7:24 Wretched man that I am! Who will deliver me from this body of death?
45Rm 7:25 Thanks be to God through Jesus Christ our Lord! So then, I myself serve the law of God with my mind, but with my flesh I serve the law of sin.
45Rm 8:1 There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
45Rm 8:2 For the law of the Spirit of life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death.
45Rm 8:3 For God has done what the law, weakened by the flesh, could not do. By sending his own Son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin, he condemned sin in the flesh,
45Rm 8:4 in order that the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to the flesh but according to the Spirit.
45Rm 8:5 For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh, but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit.
45Rm 8:6 For to set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.
45Rm 8:7 For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law; indeed, it cannot.
45Rm 8:8 Those who are in the flesh cannot please God.
45Rm 8:9 You, however, are not in the flesh but in the Spirit, if in fact the Spirit of God dwells in you. Anyone who does not have the Spirit of Christ does not belong to him.
45Rm 8:10 But if Christ is in you, although the body is dead because of sin, the Spirit is life because of righteousness.
45Rm 8:11 If the Spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through his Spirit who dwells in you.
45Rm 8:12 So then, brothers, we are debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to the flesh.
45Rm 8:13 For if you live according to the flesh you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
45Rm 8:14 For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
45Rm 8:15 For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, "Abba! Father!"
45Rm 8:16 The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God,
45Rm 8:17 and if children, then heirs--heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.
45Rm 8:18 For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.
45Rm 8:19 For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God.
45Rm 8:20 For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of him who subjected it, in hope
45Rm 8:21 that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to corruption and obtain the freedom of the glory of the children of God.
45Rm 8:22 For we know that the whole creation has been groaning together in the pains of childbirth until now.
45Rm 8:23 And not only the creation, but we ourselves, who have the firstfruits of the Spirit, groan inwardly as we wait eagerly for adoption as sons, the redemption of our bodies.
45Rm 8:24 For in this hope we were saved. Now hope that is seen is not hope. For who hopes for what he sees?
45Rm 8:25 But if we hope for what we do not see, we wait for it with patience.
45Rm 8:26 Likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness. For we do not know what to pray for as we ought, but the Spirit himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.
45Rm 8:27 And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
45Rm 8:28 And we know that for those who love God all things work together for good, for those who are called according to his purpose.
45Rm 8:29 For those whom he foreknew he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers.
45Rm 8:30 And those whom he predestined he also called, and those whom he called he also justified, and those whom he justified he also glorified.
45Rm 8:31 What then shall we say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us?
45Rm 8:32 He who did not spare his own Son but gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?
45Rm 8:33 Who shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies.
45Rm 8:34 Who is to condemn? Christ Jesus is the one who died--more than that, who was raised--who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us.
45Rm 8:35 Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation, or distress, or persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword?
45Rm 8:36 As it is written, "For your sake we are being killed all the day long; we are regarded as sheep to be slaughtered."
45Rm 8:37 No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through him who loved us.
45Rm 8:38 For I am sure that neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come, nor powers,
45Rm 8:39 nor height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God in Christ Jesus our Lord.
45Rm 9:1 I am speaking the truth in Christ--I am not lying; my conscience bears me witness in the Holy Spirit--
45Rm 9:2 that I have great sorrow and unceasing anguish in my heart.
45Rm 9:3 For I could wish that I myself were accursed and cut off from Christ for the sake of my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh.
45Rm 9:4 They are Israelites, and to them belong the adoption, the glory, the covenants, the giving of the law, the worship, and the promises.
45Rm 9:5 To them belong the patriarchs, and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ who is God over all, blessed forever. Amen.
45Rm 9:6 But it is not as though the word of God has failed. For not all who are descended from Israel belong to Israel,
45Rm 9:7 and not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring, but "Through Isaac shall your offspring be named."
45Rm 9:8 This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but the children of the promise are counted as offspring.
45Rm 9:9 For this is what the promise said: "About this time next year I will return, and Sarah shall have a son."
45Rm 9:10 And not only so, but also when Rebekah had conceived children by one man, our forefather Isaac,
45Rm 9:11 though they were not yet born and had done nothing either good or bad--in order that God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works but because of him who calls--
45Rm 9:12 she was told, "The older will serve the younger."
45Rm 9:13 As it is written, "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated."
45Rm 9:14 What shall we say then? Is there injustice on God's part? By no means!
45Rm 9:15 For he says to Moses, "I will have mercy on whom I have mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I have compassion."
45Rm 9:16 So then it depends not on human will or exertion, but on God, who has mercy.
45Rm 9:17 For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, "For this very purpose I have raised you up, that I might show my power in you, and that my name might be proclaimed in all the earth."
45Rm 9:18 So then he has mercy on whomever he wills, and he hardens whomever he wills.
45Rm 9:19 You will say to me then, "Why does he still find fault? For who can resist his will?"
45Rm 9:20 But who are you, O man, to answer back to God? Will what is molded say to its molder, "Why have you made me like this?"
45Rm 9:21 Has the potter no right over the clay, to make out of the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for dishonorable use?
45Rm 9:22 What if God, desiring to show his wrath and to make known his power, has endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction,
45Rm 9:23 in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand for glory--
45Rm 9:24 even us whom he has called, not from the Jews only but also from the Gentiles?
45Rm 9:25 As indeed he says in Hosea, "Those who were not my people I will call 'my people,' and her who was not beloved I will call 'beloved.'"
45Rm 9:26 "And in the very place where it was said to them, 'You are not my people,' there they will be called 'sons of the living God.'"
45Rm 9:27 And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: "Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, only a remnant of them will be saved,
45Rm 9:28 for the Lord will carry out his sentence upon the earth fully and without delay."
45Rm 9:29 And as Isaiah predicted, "If the Lord of hosts had not left us offspring, we would have been like Sodom and become like Gomorrah."
45Rm 9:30 What shall we say, then? That Gentiles who did not pursue righteousness have attained it, that is, a righteousness that is by faith;
45Rm 9:31 but that Israel who pursued a law that would lead to righteousness did not succeed in reaching that law.
45Rm 9:32 Why? Because they did not pursue it by faith, but as if it were based on works. They have stumbled over the stumbling stone,
45Rm 9:33 as it is written, "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense; and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."
45Rm 10:1 Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be saved.
45Rm 10:2 For I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but not according to knowledge.
45Rm 10:3 For, being ignorant of the righteousness of God, and seeking to establish their own, they did not submit to God's righteousness.
45Rm 10:4 For Christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone who believes.
45Rm 10:5 For Moses writes about the righteousness that is based on the law, that the person who does the commandments shall live by them.
45Rm 10:6 But the righteousness based on faith says, "Do not say in your heart, 'Who will ascend into heaven?'" (that is, to bring Christ down)
45Rm 10:7 or "'Who will descend into the abyss?'" (that is, to bring Christ up from the dead).
45Rm 10:8 But what does it say? "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart" (that is, the word of faith that we proclaim);
45Rm 10:9 because, if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved.
45Rm 10:10 For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth one confesses and is saved.
45Rm 10:11 For the Scripture says, "Everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame."
45Rm 10:12 For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek; for the same Lord is Lord of all, bestowing his riches on all who call on him.
45Rm 10:13 For "everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved."
45Rm 10:14 How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching?
45Rm 10:15 And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written, "How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news!"
45Rm 10:16 But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?"
45Rm 10:17 So faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ.
45Rm 10:18 But I ask, have they not heard? Indeed they have, for "Their voice has gone out to all the earth, and their words to the ends of the world."
45Rm 10:19 But I ask, did Israel not understand? First Moses says, "I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation; with a foolish nation I will make you angry."
45Rm 10:20 Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, "I have been found by those who did not seek me; I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me."
45Rm 10:21 But of Israel he says, "All day long I have held out my hands to a disobedient and contrary people."
45Rm 11:1 I ask, then, has God rejected his people? By no means! For I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe of Benjamin.
45Rm 11:2 God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew. Do you not know what the Scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel?
45Rm 11:3 "Lord, they have killed your prophets, they have demolished your altars, and I alone am left, and they seek my life."
45Rm 11:4 But what is God's reply to him? "I have kept for myself seven thousand men who have not bowed the knee to Baal."
45Rm 11:5 So too at the present time there is a remnant, chosen by grace.
45Rm 11:6 But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works; otherwise grace would no longer be grace.
45Rm 11:7 What then? Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking. The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened,
45Rm 11:8 as it is written, "God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear, down to this very day."
45Rm 11:9 And David says, "Let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution for them;
45Rm 11:10 let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see, and bend their backs forever."
45Rm 11:11 So I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall? By no means! Rather through their trespass salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel jealous.
45Rm 11:12 Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean!
45Rm 11:13 Now I am speaking to you Gentiles. Inasmuch then as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify my ministry
45Rm 11:14 in order somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous, and thus save some of them.
45Rm 11:15 For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean but life from the dead?
45Rm 11:16 If the dough offered as firstfruits is holy, so is the whole lump, and if the root is holy, so are the branches.
45Rm 11:17 But if some of the branches were broken off, and you, although a wild olive shoot, were grafted in among the others and now share in the nourishing root of the olive tree,
45Rm 11:18 do not be arrogant toward the branches. If you are, remember it is not you who support the root, but the root that supports you.
45Rm 11:19 Then you will say, "Branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in."
45Rm 11:20 That is true. They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith. So do not become proud, but fear.
45Rm 11:21 For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
45Rm 11:22 Note then the kindness and the severity of God: severity toward those who have fallen, but God's kindness to you, provided you continue in his kindness. Otherwise you too will be cut off.
45Rm 11:23 And even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief, will be grafted in, for God has the power to graft them in again.
45Rm 11:24 For if you were cut from what is by nature a wild olive tree, and grafted, contrary to nature, into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be grafted back into their own olive tree.
45Rm 11:25 Lest you be wise in your own sight, I want you to understand this mystery, brothers: a partial hardening has come upon Israel, until the fullness of the Gentiles has come in.
45Rm 11:26 And in this way all Israel will be saved, as it is written, "The Deliverer will come from Zion, he will banish ungodliness from Jacob";
45Rm 11:27 "and this will be my covenant with them when I take away their sins."
45Rm 11:28 As regards the gospel, they are enemies of God for your sake. But as regards election, they are beloved for the sake of their forefathers.
45Rm 11:29 For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable.
45Rm 11:30 For just as you were at one time disobedient to God but now have received mercy because of their disobedience,
45Rm 11:31 so they too have now been disobedient in order that by the mercy shown to you they also may now receive mercy.
45Rm 11:32 For God has consigned all to disobedience, that he may have mercy on all.
45Rm 11:33 Oh, the depth of the riches and wisdom and knowledge of God! How unsearchable are his judgments and how inscrutable his ways!
45Rm 11:34 "For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor?"
45Rm 11:35 "Or who has given a gift to him that he might be repaid?"
45Rm 11:36 For from him and through him and to him are all things. To him be glory forever. Amen.
45Rm 12:1 I appeal to you therefore, brothers, by the mercies of God, to present your bodies as a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship.
45Rm 12:2 Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect.
45Rm 12:3 For by the grace given to me I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned.
45Rm 12:4 For as in one body we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function,
45Rm 12:5 so we, though many, are one body in Christ, and individually members one of another.
45Rm 12:6 Having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us use them: if prophecy, in proportion to our faith;
45Rm 12:7 if service, in our serving; the one who teaches, in his teaching;
45Rm 12:8 the one who exhorts, in his exhortation; the one who contributes, in generosity; the one who leads, with zeal; the one who does acts of mercy, with cheerfulness.
45Rm 12:9 Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil; hold fast to what is good.
45Rm 12:10 Love one another with brotherly affection. Outdo one another in showing honor.
45Rm 12:11 Do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirit, serve the Lord.
45Rm 12:12 Rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer.
45Rm 12:13 Contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality.
45Rm 12:14 Bless those who persecute you; bless and do not curse them.
45Rm 12:15 Rejoice with those who rejoice, weep with those who weep.
45Rm 12:16 Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never be wise in your own sight.
45Rm 12:17 Repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all.
45Rm 12:18 If possible, so far as it depends on you, live peaceably with all.
45Rm 12:19 Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God, for it is written, "Vengeance is mine, I will repay, says the Lord."
45Rm 12:20 To the contrary, "if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him something to drink; for by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head."
45Rm 12:21 Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.
45Rm 13:1 Let every person be subject to the governing authorities. For there is no authority except from God, and those that exist have been instituted by God.
45Rm 13:2 Therefore whoever resists the authorities resists what God has appointed, and those who resist will incur judgment.
45Rm 13:3 For rulers are not a terror to good conduct, but to bad. Would you have no fear of the one who is in authority? Then do what is good, and you will receive his approval,
45Rm 13:4 for he is God's servant for your good. But if you do wrong, be afraid, for he does not bear the sword in vain. For he is the servant of God, an avenger who carries out God's wrath on the wrongdoer.
45Rm 13:5 Therefore one must be in subjection, not only to avoid God's wrath but also for the sake of conscience.
45Rm 13:6 For because of this you also pay taxes, for the authorities are ministers of God, attending to this very thing.
45Rm 13:7 Pay to all what is owed to them: taxes to whom taxes are owed, revenue to whom revenue is owed, respect to whom respect is owed, honor to whom honor is owed.
45Rm 13:8 Owe no one anything, except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled the law.
45Rm 13:9 For the commandments, "You shall not commit adultery, You shall not murder, You shall not steal, You shall not covet," and any other commandment, are summed up in this word: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
45Rm 13:10 Love does no wrong to a neighbor; therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
45Rm 13:11 Besides this you know the time, that the hour has come for you to wake from sleep. For salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed.
45Rm 13:12 The night is far gone; the day is at hand. So then let us cast off the works of darkness and put on the armor of light.
45Rm 13:13 Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy.
45Rm 13:14 But put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh, to gratify its desires.
45Rm 14:1 As for the one who is weak in faith, welcome him, but not to quarrel over opinions.
45Rm 14:2 One person believes he may eat anything, while the weak person eats only vegetables.
45Rm 14:3 Let not the one who eats despise the one who abstains, and let not the one who abstains pass judgment on the one who eats, for God has welcomed him.
45Rm 14:4 Who are you to pass judgment on the servant of another? It is before his own master that he stands or falls. And he will be upheld, for the Lord is able to make him stand.
45Rm 14:5 One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.
45Rm 14:6 The one who observes the day, observes it in honor of the Lord. The one who eats, eats in honor of the Lord, since he gives thanks to God, while the one who abstains, abstains in honor of the Lord and gives thanks to God.
45Rm 14:7 For none of us lives to himself, and none of us dies to himself.
45Rm 14:8 For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then, whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's.
45Rm 14:9 For to this end Christ died and lived again, that he might be Lord both of the dead and of the living.
45Rm 14:10 Why do you pass judgment on your brother? Or you, why do you despise your brother? For we will all stand before the judgment seat of God;
45Rm 14:11 for it is written, "As I live, says the Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God."
45Rm 14:12 So then each of us will give an account of himself to God.
45Rm 14:13 Therefore let us not pass judgment on one another any longer, but rather decide never to put a stumbling block or hindrance in the way of a brother.
45Rm 14:14 I know and am persuaded in the Lord Jesus that nothing is unclean in itself, but it is unclean for anyone who thinks it unclean.
45Rm 14:15 For if your brother is grieved by what you eat, you are no longer walking in love. By what you eat, do not destroy the one for whom Christ died.
45Rm 14:16 So do not let what you regard as good be spoken of as evil.
45Rm 14:17 For the kingdom of God is not a matter of eating and drinking but of righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 14:18 Whoever thus serves Christ is acceptable to God and approved by men.
45Rm 14:19 So then let us pursue what makes for peace and for mutual upbuilding.
45Rm 14:20 Do not, for the sake of food, destroy the work of God. Everything is indeed clean, but it is wrong for anyone to make another stumble by what he eats.
45Rm 14:21 It is good not to eat meat or drink wine or do anything that causes your brother to stumble.
45Rm 14:22 The faith that you have, keep between yourself and God. Blessed is the one who has no reason to pass judgment on himself for what he approves.
45Rm 14:23 But whoever has doubts is condemned if he eats, because the eating is not from faith. For whatever does not proceed from faith is sin.
45Rm 15:1 We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves.
45Rm 15:2 Let each of us please his neighbor for his good, to build him up.
45Rm 15:3 For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, "The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me."
45Rm 15:4 For whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance and through the encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope.
45Rm 15:5 May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus,
45Rm 15:6 that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
45Rm 15:7 Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God.
45Rm 15:8 For I tell you that Christ became a servant to the circumcised to show God's truthfulness, in order to confirm the promises given to the patriarchs,
45Rm 15:9 and in order that the Gentiles might glorify God for his mercy. As it is written, "Therefore I will praise you among the Gentiles, and sing to your name."
45Rm 15:10 And again it is said, "Rejoice, O Gentiles, with his people."
45Rm 15:11 And again, "Praise the Lord, all you Gentiles, and let all the peoples extol him."
45Rm 15:12 And again Isaiah says, "The root of Jesse will come, even he who arises to rule the Gentiles; in him will the Gentiles hope."
45Rm 15:13 May the God of hope fill you with all joy and peace in believing, so that by the power of the Holy Spirit you may abound in hope.
45Rm 15:14 I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge and able to instruct one another.
45Rm 15:15 But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder, because of the grace given me by God
45Rm 15:16 to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles in the priestly service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable, sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
45Rm 15:17 In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God.
45Rm 15:18 For I will not venture to speak of anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience--by word and deed,
45Rm 15:19 by the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God--so that from Jerusalem and all the way around to Illyricum I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ;
45Rm 15:20 and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been named, lest I build on someone else's foundation,
45Rm 15:21 but as it is written, "Those who have never been told of him will see, and those who have never heard will understand."
45Rm 15:22 This is the reason why I have so often been hindered from coming to you.
45Rm 15:23 But now, since I no longer have any room for work in these regions, and since I have longed for many years to come to you,
45Rm 15:24 I hope to see you in passing as I go to Spain, and to be helped on my journey there by you, once I have enjoyed your company for a while.
45Rm 15:25 At present, however, I am going to Jerusalem bringing aid to the saints.
45Rm 15:26 For Macedonia and Achaia have been pleased to make some contribution for the poor among the saints at Jerusalem.
45Rm 15:27 For they were pleased to do it, and indeed they owe it to them. For if the Gentiles have come to share in their spiritual blessings, they ought also to be of service to them in material blessings.
45Rm 15:28 When therefore I have completed this and have delivered to them what has been collected, I will leave for Spain by way of you.
45Rm 15:29 I know that when I come to you I will come in the fullness of the blessing of Christ.
45Rm 15:30 I appeal to you, brothers, by our Lord Jesus Christ and by the love of the Spirit, to strive together with me in your prayers to God on my behalf,
45Rm 15:31 that I may be delivered from the unbelievers in Judea, and that my service for Jerusalem may be acceptable to the saints,
45Rm 15:32 so that by God's will I may come to you with joy and be refreshed in your company.
45Rm 15:33 May the God of peace be with you all. Amen.
45Rm 16:1 I commend to you our sister Phoebe, a servant of the church at Cenchreae,
45Rm 16:2 that you may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints, and help her in whatever she may need from you, for she has been a patron of many and of myself as well.
45Rm 16:3 Greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus,
45Rm 16:4 who risked their necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks but all the churches of the Gentiles give thanks as well.
45Rm 16:5 Greet also the church in their house. Greet my beloved Epaenetus, who was the first convert to Christ in Asia.
45Rm 16:6 Greet Mary, who has worked hard for you.
45Rm 16:7 Greet Andronicus and Junia, my kinsmen and my fellow prisoners. They are well known to the apostles, and they were in Christ before me.
45Rm 16:8 Greet Ampliatus, my beloved in the Lord.
45Rm 16:9 Greet Urbanus, our fellow worker in Christ, and my beloved Stachys.
45Rm 16:10 Greet Apelles, who is approved in Christ. Greet those who belong to the family of Aristobulus.
45Rm 16:11 Greet my kinsman Herodion. Greet those in the Lord who belong to the family of Narcissus.
45Rm 16:12 Greet those workers in the Lord, Tryphaena and Tryphosa. Greet the beloved Persis, who has worked hard in the Lord.
45Rm 16:13 Greet Rufus, chosen in the Lord; also his mother, who has been a mother to me as well.
45Rm 16:14 Greet Asyncritus, Phlegon, Hermes, Patrobas, Hermas, and the brothers who are with them.
45Rm 16:15 Greet Philologus, Julia, Nereus and his sister, and Olympas, and all the saints who are with them.
45Rm 16:16 Greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you.
45Rm 16:17 I appeal to you, brothers, to watch out for those who cause divisions and create obstacles contrary to the doctrine that you have been taught; avoid them.
45Rm 16:18 For such persons do not serve our Lord Christ, but their own appetites, and by smooth talk and flattery they deceive the hearts of the naive.
45Rm 16:19 For your obedience is known to all, so that I rejoice over you, but I want you to be wise as to what is good and innocent as to what is evil.
45Rm 16:20 The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet. The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
45Rm 16:21 Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you; so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
45Rm 16:22 I Tertius, who wrote this letter, greet you in the Lord.
45Rm 16:23 Gaius, who is host to me and to the whole church, greets you. Erastus, the city treasurer, and our brother Quartus, greet you.
45Rm 16:24 (none)
45Rm 16:25 Now to him who is able to strengthen you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages
45Rm 16:26 but has now been disclosed and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God, to bring about the obedience of faith--
45Rm 16:27 to the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ! Amen.
46
461Co 1:1 Paul, called by the will of God to be an apostle of Christ Jesus, and our brother Sosthenes,
461Co 1:2 To the church of God that is in Corinth, to those sanctified in Christ Jesus, called to be saints together with all those who in every place call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, both their Lord and ours:
461Co 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 1:4 I give thanks to my God always for you because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus,
461Co 1:5 that in every way you were enriched in him in all speech and all knowledge--
461Co 1:6 even as the testimony about Christ was confirmed among you--
461Co 1:7 so that you are not lacking in any spiritual gift, as you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
461Co 1:8 who will sustain you to the end, guiltless in the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 1:9 God is faithful, by whom you were called into the fellowship of his Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.
461Co 1:10 I appeal to you, brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment.
461Co 1:11 For it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers.
461Co 1:12 What I mean is that each one of you says, "I follow Paul," or "I follow Apollos," or "I follow Cephas," or "I follow Christ."
461Co 1:13 Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul?
461Co 1:14 I thank God that I baptized none of you except Crispus and Gaius,
461Co 1:15 so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name.
461Co 1:16 (I did baptize also the household of Stephanas. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else.)
461Co 1:17 For Christ did not send me to baptize but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, lest the cross of Christ be emptied of its power.
461Co 1:18 For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved it is the power of God.
461Co 1:19 For it is written, "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise, and the discernment of the discerning I will thwart."
461Co 1:20 Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where is the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
461Co 1:21 For since, in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe.
461Co 1:22 For Jews demand signs and Greeks seek wisdom,
461Co 1:23 but we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles,
461Co 1:24 but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God.
461Co 1:25 For the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men.
461Co 1:26 For consider your calling, brothers: not many of you were wise according to worldly standards, not many were powerful, not many were of noble birth.
461Co 1:27 But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the wise; God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong;
461Co 1:28 God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not, to bring to nothing things that are,
461Co 1:29 so that no human being might boast in the presence of God.
461Co 1:30 And because of him you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption,
461Co 1:31 so that, as it is written, "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
461Co 2:1 And I, when I came to you, brothers, did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom.
461Co 2:2 For I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and him crucified.
461Co 2:3 And I was with you in weakness and in fear and much trembling,
461Co 2:4 and my speech and my message were not in plausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power,
461Co 2:5 that your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men but in the power of God.
461Co 2:6 Yet among the mature we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age or of the rulers of this age, who are doomed to pass away.
461Co 2:7 But we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glory.
461Co 2:8 None of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had, they would not have crucified the Lord of glory.
461Co 2:9 But, as it is written, "What no eye has seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared for those who love him"--
461Co 2:10 these things God has revealed to us through the Spirit. For the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God.
461Co 2:11 For who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of that person, which is in him? So also no one comprehends the thoughts of God except the Spirit of God.
461Co 2:12 Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, that we might understand the things freely given us by God.
461Co 2:13 And we impart this in words not taught by human wisdom but taught by the Spirit, interpreting spiritual truths to those who are spiritual.
461Co 2:14 The natural person does not accept the things of the Spirit of God, for they are folly to him, and he is not able to understand them because they are spiritually discerned.
461Co 2:15 The spiritual person judges all things, but is himself to be judged by no one.
461Co 2:16 "For who has understood the mind of the Lord so as to instruct him?" But we have the mind of Christ.
461Co 3:1 But I, brothers, could not address you as spiritual people, but as people of the flesh, as infants in Christ.
461Co 3:2 I fed you with milk, not solid food, for you were not ready for it. And even now you are not yet ready,
461Co 3:3 for you are still of the flesh. For while there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not of the flesh and behaving only in a human way?
461Co 3:4 For when one says, "I follow Paul," and another, "I follow Apollos," are you not being merely human?
461Co 3:5 What then is Apollos? What is Paul? Servants through whom you believed, as the Lord assigned to each.
461Co 3:6 I planted, Apollos watered, but God gave the growth.
461Co 3:7 So neither he who plants nor he who waters is anything, but only God who gives the growth.
461Co 3:8 He who plants and he who waters are one, and each will receive his wages according to his labor.
461Co 3:9 For we are God's fellow workers. You are God's field, God's building.
461Co 3:10 According to the grace of God given to me, like a skilled master builder I laid a foundation, and someone else is building upon it. Let each one take care how he builds upon it.
461Co 3:11 For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.
461Co 3:12 Now if anyone builds on the foundation with gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, straw--
461Co 3:13 each one's work will become manifest, for the Day will disclose it, because it will be revealed by fire, and the fire will test what sort of work each one has done.
461Co 3:14 If the work that anyone has built on the foundation survives, he will receive a reward.
461Co 3:15 If anyone's work is burned up, he will suffer loss, though he himself will be saved, but only as through fire.
461Co 3:16 Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?
461Co 3:17 If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him. For God's temple is holy, and you are that temple.
461Co 3:18 Let no one deceive himself. If anyone among you thinks that he is wise in this age, let him become a fool that he may become wise.
461Co 3:19 For the wisdom of this world is folly with God. For it is written, "He catches the wise in their craftiness,"
461Co 3:20 and again, "The Lord knows the thoughts of the wise, that they are futile."
461Co 3:21 So let no one boast in men. For all things are yours,
461Co 3:22 whether Paul or Apollos or Cephas or the world or life or death or the present or the future--all are yours,
461Co 3:23 and you are Christ's, and Christ is God's.
461Co 4:1 This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God.
461Co 4:2 Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found trustworthy.
461Co 4:3 But with me it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself.
461Co 4:4 For I am not aware of anything against myself, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me.
461Co 4:5 Therefore do not pronounce judgment before the time, before the Lord comes, who will bring to light the things now hidden in darkness and will disclose the purposes of the heart. Then each one will receive his commendation from God.
461Co 4:6 I have applied all these things to myself and Apollos for your benefit, brothers, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another.
461Co 4:7 For who sees anything different in you? What do you have that you did not receive? If then you received it, why do you boast as if you did not receive it?
461Co 4:8 Already you have all you want! Already you have become rich! Without us you have become kings! And would that you did reign, so that we might share the rule with you!
461Co 4:9 For I think that God has exhibited us apostles as last of all, like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world, to angels, and to men.
461Co 4:10 We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak, but you are strong. You are held in honor, but we in disrepute.
461Co 4:11 To the present hour we hunger and thirst, we are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless,
461Co 4:12 and we labor, working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless; when persecuted, we endure;
461Co 4:13 when slandered, we entreat. We have become, and are still, like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things.
461Co 4:14 I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved children.
461Co 4:15 For though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers. For I became your father in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
461Co 4:16 I urge you, then, be imitators of me.
461Co 4:17 That is why I sent you Timothy, my beloved and faithful child in the Lord, to remind you of my ways in Christ, as I teach them everywhere in every church.
461Co 4:18 Some are arrogant, as though I were not coming to you.
461Co 4:19 But I will come to you soon, if the Lord wills, and I will find out not the talk of these arrogant people but their power.
461Co 4:20 For the kingdom of God does not consist in talk but in power.
461Co 4:21 What do you wish? Shall I come to you with a rod, or with love in a spirit of gentleness?
461Co 5:1 It is actually reported that there is sexual immorality among you, and of a kind that is not tolerated even among pagans, for a man has his father's wife.
461Co 5:2 And you are arrogant! Ought you not rather to mourn? Let him who has done this be removed from among you.
461Co 5:3 For though absent in body, I am present in spirit; and as if present, I have already pronounced judgment on the one who did such a thing.
461Co 5:4 When you are assembled in the name of the Lord Jesus and my spirit is present, with the power of our Lord Jesus,
461Co 5:5 you are to deliver this man to Satan for the destruction of the flesh, so that his spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord.
461Co 5:6 Your boasting is not good. Do you not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump?
461Co 5:7 Cleanse out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, as you really are unleavened. For Christ, our Passover lamb, has been sacrificed.
461Co 5:8 Let us therefore celebrate the festival, not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.
461Co 5:9 I wrote to you in my letter not to associate with sexually immoral people--
461Co 5:10 not at all meaning the sexually immoral of this world, or the greedy and swindlers, or idolaters, since then you would need to go out of the world.
461Co 5:11 But now I am writing to you not to associate with anyone who bears the name of brother if he is guilty of sexual immorality or greed, or is an idolater, reviler, drunkard, or swindler--not even to eat with such a one.
461Co 5:12 For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?
461Co 5:13 God judges those outside. "Purge the evil person from among you."
461Co 6:1 When one of you has a grievance against another, does he dare go to law before the unrighteous instead of the saints?
461Co 6:2 Or do you not know that the saints will judge the world? And if the world is to be judged by you, are you incompetent to try trivial cases?
461Co 6:3 Do you not know that we are to judge angels? How much more, then, matters pertaining to this life!
461Co 6:4 So if you have such cases, why do you lay them before those who have no standing in the church?
461Co 6:5 I say this to your shame. Can it be that there is no one among you wise enough to settle a dispute between the brothers,
461Co 6:6 but brother goes to law against brother, and that before unbelievers?
461Co 6:7 To have lawsuits at all with one another is already a defeat for you. Why not rather suffer wrong? Why not rather be defrauded?
461Co 6:8 But you yourselves wrong and defraud--even your own brothers!
461Co 6:9 Or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived: neither the sexually immoral, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality,
461Co 6:10 nor thieves, nor the greedy, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God.
461Co 6:11 And such were some of you. But you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the Spirit of our God.
461Co 6:12 "All things are lawful for me," but not all things are helpful. "All things are lawful for me," but I will not be enslaved by anything.
461Co 6:13 "Food is meant for the stomach and the stomach for food"--and God will destroy both one and the other. The body is not meant for sexual immorality, but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.
461Co 6:14 And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by his power.
461Co 6:15 Do you not know that your bodies are members of Christ? Shall I then take the members of Christ and make them members of a prostitute? Never!
461Co 6:16 Or do you not know that he who is joined to a prostitute becomes one body with her? For, as it is written, "The two will become one flesh."
461Co 6:17 But he who is joined to the Lord becomes one spirit with him.
461Co 6:18 Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body.
461Co 6:19 Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you, whom you have from God? You are not your own,
461Co 6:20 for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body.
461Co 7:1 Now concerning the matters about which you wrote: "It is good for a man not to have sexual relations with a woman."
461Co 7:2 But because of the temptation to sexual immorality, each man should have his own wife and each woman her own husband.
461Co 7:3 The husband should give to his wife her conjugal rights, and likewise the wife to her husband.
461Co 7:4 For the wife does not have authority over her own body, but the husband does. Likewise the husband does not have authority over his own body, but the wife does.
461Co 7:5 Do not deprive one another, except perhaps by agreement for a limited time, that you may devote yourselves to prayer; but then come together again, so that Satan may not tempt you because of your lack of self-control.
461Co 7:6 Now as a concession, not a command, I say this.
461Co 7:7 I wish that all were as I myself am. But each has his own gift from God, one of one kind and one of another.
461Co 7:8 To the unmarried and the widows I say that it is good for them to remain single as I am.
461Co 7:9 But if they cannot exercise self-control, they should marry. For it is better to marry than to burn with passion.
461Co 7:10 To the married I give this charge (not I, but the Lord): the wife should not separate from her husband
461Co 7:11 (but if she does, she should remain unmarried or else be reconciled to her husband), and the husband should not divorce his wife.
461Co 7:12 To the rest I say (I, not the Lord) that if any brother has a wife who is an unbeliever, and she consents to live with him, he should not divorce her.
461Co 7:13 If any woman has a husband who is an unbeliever, and he consents to live with her, she should not divorce him.
461Co 7:14 For the unbelieving husband is made holy because of his wife, and the unbelieving wife is made holy because of her husband. Otherwise your children would be unclean, but as it is, they are holy.
461Co 7:15 But if the unbelieving partner separates, let it be so. In such cases the brother or sister is not enslaved. God has called you to peace.
461Co 7:16 For how do you know, wife, whether you will save your husband? Or how do you know, husband, whether you will save your wife?
461Co 7:17 Only let each person lead the life that the Lord has assigned to him, and to which God has called him. This is my rule in all the churches.
461Co 7:18 Was anyone at the time of his call already circumcised? Let him not seek to remove the marks of circumcision. Was anyone at the time of his call uncircumcised? Let him not seek circumcision.
461Co 7:19 For neither circumcision counts for anything nor uncircumcision, but keeping the commandments of God.
461Co 7:20 Each one should remain in the condition in which he was called.
461Co 7:21 Were you a slave when called? Do not be concerned about it. (But if you can gain your freedom, avail yourself of the opportunity.)
461Co 7:22 For he who was called in the Lord as a slave is a freedman of the Lord. Likewise he who was free when called is a slave of Christ.
461Co 7:23 You were bought with a price; do not become slaves of men.
461Co 7:24 So, brothers, in whatever condition each was called, there let him remain with God.
461Co 7:25 Now concerning the betrothed, I have no command from the Lord, but I give my judgment as one who by the Lord's mercy is trustworthy.
461Co 7:26 I think that in view of the present distress it is good for a person to remain as he is.
461Co 7:27 Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be free. Are you free from a wife? Do not seek a wife.
461Co 7:28 But if you do marry, you have not sinned, and if a betrothed woman marries, she has not sinned. Yet those who marry will have worldly troubles, and I would spare you that.
461Co 7:29 This is what I mean, brothers: the appointed time has grown very short. From now on, let those who have wives live as though they had none,
461Co 7:30 and those who mourn as though they were not mourning, and those who rejoice as though they were not rejoicing, and those who buy as though they had no goods,
461Co 7:31 and those who deal with the world as though they had no dealings with it. For the present form of this world is passing away.
461Co 7:32 I want you to be free from anxieties. The unmarried man is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to please the Lord.
461Co 7:33 But the married man is anxious about worldly things, how to please his wife,
461Co 7:34 and his interests are divided. And the unmarried or betrothed woman is anxious about the things of the Lord, how to be holy in body and spirit. But the married woman is anxious about worldly things, how to please her husband.
461Co 7:35 I say this for your own benefit, not to lay any restraint upon you, but to promote good order and to secure your undivided devotion to the Lord.
461Co 7:36 If anyone thinks that he is not behaving properly toward his betrothed, if his passions are strong, and it has to be, let him do as he wishes: let them marry--it is no sin.
461Co 7:37 But whoever is firmly established in his heart, being under no necessity but having his desire under control, and has determined this in his heart, to keep her as his betrothed, he will do well.
461Co 7:38 So then he who marries his betrothed does well, and he who refrains from marriage will do even better.
461Co 7:39 A wife is bound to her husband as long as he lives. But if her husband dies, she is free to be married to whom she wishes, only in the Lord.
461Co 7:40 Yet in my judgment she is happier if she remains as she is. And I think that I too have the Spirit of God.
461Co 8:1 Now concerning food offered to idols: we know that "all of us possess knowledge." This "knowledge" puffs up, but love builds up.
461Co 8:2 If anyone imagines that he knows something, he does not yet know as he ought to know.
461Co 8:3 But if anyone loves God, he is known by God.
461Co 8:4 Therefore, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that "an idol has no real existence," and that "there is no God but one."
461Co 8:5 For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth--as indeed there are many "gods" and many "lords"--
461Co 8:6 yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.
461Co 8:7 However, not all possess this knowledge. But some, through former association with idols, eat food as really offered to an idol, and their conscience, being weak, is defiled.
461Co 8:8 Food will not commend us to God. We are no worse off if we do not eat, and no better off if we do.
461Co 8:9 But take care that this right of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the weak.
461Co 8:10 For if anyone sees you who have knowledge eating in an idol's temple, will he not be encouraged, if his conscience is weak, to eat food offered to idols?
461Co 8:11 And so by your knowledge this weak person is destroyed, the brother for whom Christ died.
461Co 8:12 Thus, sinning against your brothers and wounding their conscience when it is weak, you sin against Christ.
461Co 8:13 Therefore, if food makes my brother stumble, I will never eat meat, lest I make my brother stumble.
461Co 9:1 Am I not free? Am I not an apostle? Have I not seen Jesus our Lord? Are not you my workmanship in the Lord?
461Co 9:2 If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you, for you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
461Co 9:3 This is my defense to those who would examine me.
461Co 9:4 Do we not have the right to eat and drink?
461Co 9:5 Do we not have the right to take along a believing wife, as do the other apostles and the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
461Co 9:6 Or is it only Barnabas and I who have no right to refrain from working for a living?
461Co 9:7 Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard without eating any of its fruit? Or who tends a flock without getting some of the milk?
461Co 9:8 Do I say these things on human authority? Does not the Law say the same?
461Co 9:9 For it is written in the Law of Moses, "You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain." Is it for oxen that God is concerned?
461Co 9:10 Does he not speak entirely for our sake? It was written for our sake, because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh in hope of sharing in the crop.
461Co 9:11 If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much if we reap material things from you?
461Co 9:12 If others share this rightful claim on you, do not we even more? Nevertheless, we have not made use of this right, but we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.
461Co 9:13 Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from the temple, and those who serve at the altar share in the sacrificial offerings?
461Co 9:14 In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living by the gospel.
461Co 9:15 But I have made no use of any of these rights, nor am I writing these things to secure any such provision. For I would rather die than have anyone deprive me of my ground for boasting.
461Co 9:16 For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me if I do not preach the gospel!
461Co 9:17 For if I do this of my own will, I have a reward, but if not of my own will, I am still entrusted with a stewardship.
461Co 9:18 What then is my reward? That in my preaching I may present the gospel free of charge, so as not to make full use of my right in the gospel.
461Co 9:19 For though I am free from all, I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them.
461Co 9:20 To the Jews I became as a Jew, in order to win Jews. To those under the law I became as one under the law (though not being myself under the law) that I might win those under the law.
461Co 9:21 To those outside the law I became as one outside the law (not being outside the law of God but under the law of Christ) that I might win those outside the law.
461Co 9:22 To the weak I became weak, that I might win the weak. I have become all things to all people, that by all means I might save some.
461Co 9:23 I do it all for the sake of the gospel, that I may share with them in its blessings.
461Co 9:24 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run, but only one receives the prize? So run that you may obtain it.
461Co 9:25 Every athlete exercises self-control in all things. They do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.
461Co 9:26 So I do not run aimlessly; I do not box as one beating the air.
461Co 9:27 But I discipline my body and keep it under control, lest after preaching to others I myself should be disqualified.
461Co 10:1 For I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea,
461Co 10:2 and all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea,
461Co 10:3 and all ate the same spiritual food,
461Co 10:4 and all drank the same spiritual drink. For they drank from the spiritual Rock that followed them, and the Rock was Christ.
461Co 10:5 Nevertheless, with most of them God was not pleased, for they were overthrown in the wilderness.
461Co 10:6 Now these things took place as examples for us, that we might not desire evil as they did.
461Co 10:7 Do not be idolaters as some of them were; as it is written, "The people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play."
461Co 10:8 We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and twenty-three thousand fell in a single day.
461Co 10:9 We must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents,
461Co 10:10 nor grumble, as some of them did and were destroyed by the Destroyer.
461Co 10:11 Now these things happened to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction, on whom the end of the ages has come.
461Co 10:12 Therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall.
461Co 10:13 No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability, but with the temptation he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it.
461Co 10:14 Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry.
461Co 10:15 I speak as to sensible people; judge for yourselves what I say.
461Co 10:16 The cup of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break, is it not a participation in the body of Christ?
461Co 10:17 Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread.
461Co 10:18 Consider the people of Israel: are not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar?
461Co 10:19 What do I imply then? That food offered to idols is anything, or that an idol is anything?
461Co 10:20 No, I imply that what pagans sacrifice they offer to demons and not to God. I do not want you to be participants with demons.
461Co 10:21 You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons. You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
461Co 10:22 Shall we provoke the Lord to jealousy? Are we stronger than he?
461Co 10:23 "All things are lawful," but not all things are helpful. "All things are lawful," but not all things build up.
461Co 10:24 Let no one seek his own good, but the good of his neighbor.
461Co 10:25 Eat whatever is sold in the meat market without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
461Co 10:26 For "the earth is the Lord's, and the fullness thereof."
461Co 10:27 If one of the unbelievers invites you to dinner and you are disposed to go, eat whatever is set before you without raising any question on the ground of conscience.
461Co 10:28 But if someone says to you, "This has been offered in sacrifice," then do not eat it, for the sake of the one who informed you, and for the sake of conscience--
461Co 10:29 I do not mean your conscience, but his. For why should my liberty be determined by someone else's conscience?
461Co 10:30 If I partake with thankfulness, why am I denounced because of that for which I give thanks?
461Co 10:31 So, whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.
461Co 10:32 Give no offense to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God,
461Co 10:33 just as I try to please everyone in everything I do, not seeking my own advantage, but that of many, that they may be saved.
461Co 11:1 Be imitators of me, as I am of Christ.
461Co 11:2 Now I commend you because you remember me in everything and maintain the traditions even as I delivered them to you.
461Co 11:3 But I want you to understand that the head of every man is Christ, the head of a wife is her husband, and the head of Christ is God.
461Co 11:4 Every man who prays or prophesies with his head covered dishonors his head,
461Co 11:5 but every wife who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered dishonors her head, since it is the same as if her head were shaven.
461Co 11:6 For if a wife will not cover her head, then she should cut her hair short. But since it is disgraceful for a wife to cut off her hair or shave her head, let her cover her head.
461Co 11:7 For a man ought not to cover his head, since he is the image and glory of God, but woman is the glory of man.
461Co 11:8 For man was not made from woman, but woman from man.
461Co 11:9 Neither was man created for woman, but woman for man.
461Co 11:10 That is why a wife ought to have a symbol of authority on her head, because of the angels.
461Co 11:11 Nevertheless, in the Lord woman is not independent of man nor man of woman;
461Co 11:12 for as woman was made from man, so man is now born of woman. And all things are from God.
461Co 11:13 Judge for yourselves: is it proper for a wife to pray to God with her head uncovered?
461Co 11:14 Does not nature itself teach you that if a man wears long hair it is a disgrace for him,
461Co 11:15 but if a woman has long hair, it is her glory? For her hair is given to her for a covering.
461Co 11:16 If anyone is inclined to be contentious, we have no such practice, nor do the churches of God.
461Co 11:17 But in the following instructions I do not commend you, because when you come together it is not for the better but for the worse.
461Co 11:18 For, in the first place, when you come together as a church, I hear that there are divisions among you. And I believe it in part,
461Co 11:19 for there must be factions among you in order that those who are genuine among you may be recognized.
461Co 11:20 When you come together, it is not the Lord's supper that you eat.
461Co 11:21 For in eating, each one goes ahead with his own meal. One goes hungry, another gets drunk.
461Co 11:22 What! Do you not have houses to eat and drink in? Or do you despise the church of God and humiliate those who have nothing? What shall I say to you? Shall I commend you in this? No, I will not.
461Co 11:23 For I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread,
461Co 11:24 and when he had given thanks, he broke it, and said, "This is my body which is for you. Do this in remembrance of me."
461Co 11:25 In the same way also he took the cup, after supper, saying, "This cup is the new covenant in my blood. Do this, as often as you drink it, in remembrance of me."
461Co 11:26 For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
461Co 11:27 Whoever, therefore, eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty concerning the body and blood of the Lord.
461Co 11:28 Let a person examine himself, then, and so eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
461Co 11:29 For anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on himself.
461Co 11:30 That is why many of you are weak and ill, and some have died.
461Co 11:31 But if we judged ourselves truly, we would not be judged.
461Co 11:32 But when we are judged by the Lord, we are disciplined so that we may not be condemned along with the world.
461Co 11:33 So then, my brothers, when you come together to eat, wait for one another--
461Co 11:34 if anyone is hungry, let him eat at home--so that when you come together it will not be for judgment. About the other things I will give directions when I come.
461Co 12:1 Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed.
461Co 12:2 You know that when you were pagans you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led.
461Co 12:3 Therefore I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says "Jesus is accursed!" and no one can say "Jesus is Lord" except in the Holy Spirit.
461Co 12:4 Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit;
461Co 12:5 and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord;
461Co 12:6 and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone.
461Co 12:7 To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.
461Co 12:8 For to one is given through the Spirit the utterance of wisdom, and to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same Spirit,
461Co 12:9 to another faith by the same Spirit, to another gifts of healing by the one Spirit,
461Co 12:10 to another the working of miracles, to another prophecy, to another the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues, to another the interpretation of tongues.
461Co 12:11 All these are empowered by one and the same Spirit, who apportions to each one individually as he wills.
461Co 12:12 For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many, are one body, so it is with Christ.
461Co 12:13 For in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body--Jews or Greeks, slaves or free--and all were made to drink of one Spirit.
461Co 12:14 For the body does not consist of one member but of many.
461Co 12:15 If the foot should say, "Because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body.
461Co 12:16 And if the ear should say, "Because I am not an eye, I do not belong to the body," that would not make it any less a part of the body.
461Co 12:17 If the whole body were an eye, where would be the sense of hearing? If the whole body were an ear, where would be the sense of smell?
461Co 12:18 But as it is, God arranged the members in the body, each one of them, as he chose.
461Co 12:19 If all were a single member, where would the body be?
461Co 12:20 As it is, there are many parts, yet one body.
461Co 12:21 The eye cannot say to the hand, "I have no need of you," nor again the head to the feet, "I have no need of you."
461Co 12:22 On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker are indispensable,
461Co 12:23 and on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greater honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty,
461Co 12:24 which our more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body, giving greater honor to the part that lacked it,
461Co 12:25 that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another.
461Co 12:26 If one member suffers, all suffer together; if one member is honored, all rejoice together.
461Co 12:27 Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it.
461Co 12:28 And God has appointed in the church first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, then miracles, then gifts of healing, helping, administrating, and various kinds of tongues.
461Co 12:29 Are all apostles? Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work miracles?
461Co 12:30 Do all possess gifts of healing? Do all speak with tongues? Do all interpret?
461Co 12:31 But earnestly desire the higher gifts. And I will show you a still more excellent way.
461Co 13:1 If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal.
461Co 13:2 And if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing.
461Co 13:3 If I give away all I have, and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing.
461Co 13:4 Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant
461Co 13:5 or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful;
461Co 13:6 it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.
461Co 13:7 Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
461Co 13:8 Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away; as for tongues, they will cease; as for knowledge, it will pass away.
461Co 13:9 For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
461Co 13:10 but when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away.
461Co 13:11 When I was a child, I spoke like a child, I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways.
461Co 13:12 For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.
461Co 13:13 So now faith, hope, and love abide, these three; but the greatest of these is love.
461Co 14:1 Pursue love, and earnestly desire the spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy.
461Co 14:2 For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God; for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the Spirit.
461Co 14:3 On the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their upbuilding and encouragement and consolation.
461Co 14:4 The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church.
461Co 14:5 Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues, unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built up.
461Co 14:6 Now, brothers, if I come to you speaking in tongues, how will I benefit you unless I bring you some revelation or knowledge or prophecy or teaching?
461Co 14:7 If even lifeless instruments, such as the flute or the harp, do not give distinct notes, how will anyone know what is played?
461Co 14:8 And if the bugle gives an indistinct sound, who will get ready for battle?
461Co 14:9 So with yourselves, if with your tongue you utter speech that is not intelligible, how will anyone know what is said? For you will be speaking into the air.
461Co 14:10 There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning,
461Co 14:11 but if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me.
461Co 14:12 So with yourselves, since you are eager for manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church.
461Co 14:13 Therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray for the power to interpret.
461Co 14:14 For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays but my mind is unfruitful.
461Co 14:15 What am I to do? I will pray with my spirit, but I will pray with my mind also; I will sing praise with my spirit, but I will sing with my mind also.
461Co 14:16 Otherwise, if you give thanks with your spirit, how can anyone in the position of an outsider say "Amen" to your thanksgiving when he does not know what you are saying?
461Co 14:17 For you may be giving thanks well enough, but the other person is not being built up.
461Co 14:18 I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you.
461Co 14:19 Nevertheless, in church I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue.
461Co 14:20 Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Be infants in evil, but in your thinking be mature.
461Co 14:21 In the Law it is written, "By people of strange tongues and by the lips of foreigners will I speak to this people, and even then they will not listen to me, says the Lord."
461Co 14:22 Thus tongues are a sign not for believers but for unbelievers, while prophecy is a sign not for unbelievers but for believers.
461Co 14:23 If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders or unbelievers enter, will they not say that you are out of your minds?
461Co 14:24 But if all prophesy, and an unbeliever or outsider enters, he is convicted by all, he is called to account by all,
461Co 14:25 the secrets of his heart are disclosed, and so, falling on his face, he will worship God and declare that God is really among you.
461Co 14:26 What then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a hymn, a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.
461Co 14:27 If any speak in a tongue, let there be only two or at most three, and each in turn, and let someone interpret.
461Co 14:28 But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God.
461Co 14:29 Let two or three prophets speak, and let the others weigh what is said.
461Co 14:30 If a revelation is made to another sitting there, let the first be silent.
461Co 14:31 For you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all be encouraged,
461Co 14:32 and the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.
461Co 14:33 For God is not a God of confusion but of peace. As in all the churches of the saints,
461Co 14:34 the women should keep silent in the churches. For they are not permitted to speak, but should be in submission, as the Law also says.
461Co 14:35 If there is anything they desire to learn, let them ask their husbands at home. For it is shameful for a woman to speak in church.
461Co 14:36 Or was it from you that the word of God came? Or are you the only ones it has reached?
461Co 14:37 If anyone thinks that he is a prophet, or spiritual, he should acknowledge that the things I am writing to you are a command of the Lord.
461Co 14:38 If anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.
461Co 14:39 So, my brothers, earnestly desire to prophesy, and do not forbid speaking in tongues.
461Co 14:40 But all things should be done decently and in order.
461Co 15:1 Now I would remind you, brothers, of the gospel I preached to you, which you received, in which you stand,
461Co 15:2 and by which you are being saved, if you hold fast to the word I preached to you--unless you believed in vain.
461Co 15:3 For I delivered to you as of first importance what I also received: that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures,
461Co 15:4 that he was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures,
461Co 15:5 and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the twelve.
461Co 15:6 Then he appeared to more than five hundred brothers at one time, most of whom are still alive, though some have fallen asleep.
461Co 15:7 Then he appeared to James, then to all the apostles.
461Co 15:8 Last of all, as to one untimely born, he appeared also to me.
461Co 15:9 For I am the least of the apostles, unworthy to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God.
461Co 15:10 But by the grace of God I am what I am, and his grace toward me was not in vain. On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace of God that is with me.
461Co 15:11 Whether then it was I or they, so we preach and so you believed.
461Co 15:12 Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
461Co 15:13 But if there is no resurrection of the dead, then not even Christ has been raised.
461Co 15:14 And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain and your faith is in vain.
461Co 15:15 We are even found to be misrepresenting God, because we testified about God that he raised Christ, whom he did not raise if it is true that the dead are not raised.
461Co 15:16 For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised.
461Co 15:17 And if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins.
461Co 15:18 Then those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
461Co 15:19 If in Christ we have hope in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied.
461Co 15:20 But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep.
461Co 15:21 For as by a man came death, by a man has come also the resurrection of the dead.
461Co 15:22 For as in Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive.
461Co 15:23 But each in his own order: Christ the firstfruits, then at his coming those who belong to Christ.
461Co 15:24 Then comes the end, when he delivers the kingdom to God the Father after destroying every rule and every authority and power.
461Co 15:25 For he must reign until he has put all his enemies under his feet.
461Co 15:26 The last enemy to be destroyed is death.
461Co 15:27 For "God has put all things in subjection under his feet." But when it says, "all things are put in subjection," it is plain that he is excepted who put all things in subjection under him.
461Co 15:28 When all things are subjected to him, then the Son himself will also be subjected to him who put all things in subjection under him, that God may be all in all.
461Co 15:29 Otherwise, what do people mean by being baptized on behalf of the dead? If the dead are not raised at all, why are people baptized on their behalf?
461Co 15:30 Why are we in danger every hour?
461Co 15:31 I protest, brothers, by my pride in you, which I have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die every day!
461Co 15:32 What do I gain if, humanly speaking, I fought with beasts at Ephesus? If the dead are not raised, "Let us eat and drink, for tomorrow we die."
461Co 15:33 Do not be deceived: "Bad company ruins good morals."
461Co 15:34 Wake up from your drunken stupor, as is right, and do not go on sinning. For some have no knowledge of God. I say this to your shame.
461Co 15:35 But someone will ask, "How are the dead raised? With what kind of body do they come?"
461Co 15:36 You foolish person! What you sow does not come to life unless it dies.
461Co 15:37 And what you sow is not the body that is to be, but a bare kernel, perhaps of wheat or of some other grain.
461Co 15:38 But God gives it a body as he has chosen, and to each kind of seed its own body.
461Co 15:39 For not all flesh is the same, but there is one kind for humans, another for animals, another for birds, and another for fish.
461Co 15:40 There are heavenly bodies and earthly bodies, but the glory of the heavenly is of one kind, and the glory of the earthly is of another.
461Co 15:41 There is one glory of the sun, and another glory of the moon, and another glory of the stars; for star differs from star in glory.
461Co 15:42 So is it with the resurrection of the dead. What is sown is perishable; what is raised is imperishable.
461Co 15:43 It is sown in dishonor; it is raised in glory. It is sown in weakness; it is raised in power.
461Co 15:44 It is sown a natural body; it is raised a spiritual body. If there is a natural body, there is also a spiritual body.
461Co 15:45 Thus it is written, "The first man Adam became a living being"; the last Adam became a life-giving spirit.
461Co 15:46 But it is not the spiritual that is first but the natural, and then the spiritual.
461Co 15:47 The first man was from the earth, a man of dust; the second man is from heaven.
461Co 15:48 As was the man of dust, so also are those who are of the dust, and as is the man of heaven, so also are those who are of heaven.
461Co 15:49 Just as we have borne the image of the man of dust, we shall also bear the image of the man of heaven.
461Co 15:50 I tell you this, brothers: flesh and blood cannot inherit the kingdom of God, nor does the perishable inherit the imperishable.
461Co 15:51 Behold! I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but we shall all be changed,
461Co 15:52 in a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet. For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.
461Co 15:53 For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality.
461Co 15:54 When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall come to pass the saying that is written: "Death is swallowed up in victory."
461Co 15:55 "O death, where is your victory? O death, where is your sting?"
461Co 15:56 The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law.
461Co 15:57 But thanks be to God, who gives us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.
461Co 15:58 Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain.
461Co 16:1 Now concerning the collection for the saints: as I directed the churches of Galatia, so you also are to do.
461Co 16:2 On the first day of every week, each of you is to put something aside and store it up, as he may prosper, so that there will be no collecting when I come.
461Co 16:3 And when I arrive, I will send those whom you accredit by letter to carry your gift to Jerusalem.
461Co 16:4 If it seems advisable that I should go also, they will accompany me.
461Co 16:5 I will visit you after passing through Macedonia, for I intend to pass through Macedonia,
461Co 16:6 and perhaps I will stay with you or even spend the winter, so that you may help me on my journey, wherever I go.
461Co 16:7 For I do not want to see you now just in passing. I hope to spend some time with you, if the Lord permits.
461Co 16:8 But I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost,
461Co 16:9 for a wide door for effective work has opened to me, and there are many adversaries.
461Co 16:10 When Timothy comes, see that you put him at ease among you, for he is doing the work of the Lord, as I am.
461Co 16:11 So let no one despise him. Help him on his way in peace, that he may return to me, for I am expecting him with the brothers.
461Co 16:12 Now concerning our brother Apollos, I strongly urged him to visit you with the other brothers, but it was not at all his will to come now. He will come when he has opportunity.
461Co 16:13 Be watchful, stand firm in the faith, act like men, be strong.
461Co 16:14 Let all that you do be done in love.
461Co 16:15 Now I urge you, brothers--you know that the household of Stephanas were the first converts in Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves to the service of the saints--
461Co 16:16 be subject to such as these, and to every fellow worker and laborer.
461Co 16:17 I rejoice at the coming of Stephanas and Fortunatus and Achaicus, because they have made up for your absence,
461Co 16:18 for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours. Give recognition to such men.
461Co 16:19 The churches of Asia send you greetings. Aquila and Prisca, together with the church in their house, send you hearty greetings in the Lord.
461Co 16:20 All the brothers send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss.
461Co 16:21 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand.
461Co 16:22 If anyone has no love for the Lord, let him be accursed. Our Lord, come!
461Co 16:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with you.
461Co 16:24 My love be with you all in Christ Jesus. Amen.
47
472Co 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother, To the church of God that is at Corinth, with all the saints who are in the whole of Achaia:
472Co 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
472Co 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies and God of all comfort,
472Co 1:4 who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God.
472Co 1:5 For as we share abundantly in Christ's sufferings, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort too.
472Co 1:6 If we are afflicted, it is for your comfort and salvation; and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort, which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer.
472Co 1:7 Our hope for you is unshaken, for we know that as you share in our sufferings, you will also share in our comfort.
472Co 1:8 For we do not want you to be ignorant, brothers, of the affliction we experienced in Asia. For we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength that we despaired of life itself.
472Co 1:9 Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves but on God who raises the dead.
472Co 1:10 He delivered us from such a deadly peril, and he will deliver us. On him we have set our hope that he will deliver us again.
472Co 1:11 You also must help us by prayer, so that many will give thanks on our behalf for the blessing granted us through the prayers of many.
472Co 1:12 For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom but by the grace of God, and supremely so toward you.
472Co 1:13 For we are not writing to you anything other than what you read and acknowledge and I hope you will fully acknowledge--
472Co 1:14 just as you did partially acknowledge us--that on the day of our Lord Jesus you will boast of us as we will boast of you.
472Co 1:15 Because I was sure of this, I wanted to come to you first, so that you might have a second experience of grace.
472Co 1:16 I wanted to visit you on my way to Macedonia, and to come back to you from Macedonia and have you send me on my way to Judea.
472Co 1:17 Was I vacillating when I wanted to do this? Do I make my plans according to the flesh, ready to say "Yes, yes" and "No, no" at the same time?
472Co 1:18 As surely as God is faithful, our word to you has not been Yes and No.
472Co 1:19 For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, whom we proclaimed among you, Silvanus and Timothy and I, was not Yes and No, but in him it is always Yes.
472Co 1:20 For all the promises of God find their Yes in him. That is why it is through him that we utter our Amen to God for his glory.
472Co 1:21 And it is God who establishes us with you in Christ, and has anointed us,
472Co 1:22 and who has also put his seal on us and given us his Spirit in our hearts as a guarantee.
472Co 1:23 But I call God to witness against me--it was to spare you that I refrained from coming again to Corinth.
472Co 1:24 Not that we lord it over your faith, but we work with you for your joy, for you stand firm in your faith.
472Co 2:1 For I made up my mind not to make another painful visit to you.
472Co 2:2 For if I cause you pain, who is there to make me glad but the one whom I have pained?
472Co 2:3 And I wrote as I did, so that when I came I might not suffer pain from those who should have made me rejoice, for I felt sure of all of you, that my joy would be the joy of you all.
472Co 2:4 For I wrote to you out of much affliction and anguish of heart and with many tears, not to cause you pain but to let you know the abundant love that I have for you.
472Co 2:5 Now if anyone has caused pain, he has caused it not to me, but in some measure--not to put it too severely--to all of you.
472Co 2:6 For such a one, this punishment by the majority is enough,
472Co 2:7 so you should rather turn to forgive and comfort him, or he may be overwhelmed by excessive sorrow.
472Co 2:8 So I beg you to reaffirm your love for him.
472Co 2:9 For this is why I wrote, that I might test you and know whether you are obedient in everything.
472Co 2:10 Anyone whom you forgive, I also forgive. Indeed, what I have forgiven, if I have forgiven anything, has been for your sake in the presence of Christ,
472Co 2:11 so that we would not be outwitted by Satan; for we are not ignorant of his designs.
472Co 2:12 When I came to Troas to preach the gospel of Christ, even though a door was opened for me in the Lord,
472Co 2:13 my spirit was not at rest because I did not find my brother Titus there. So I took leave of them and went on to Macedonia.
472Co 2:14 But thanks be to God, who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession, and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere.
472Co 2:15 For we are the aroma of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing,
472Co 2:16 to one a fragrance from death to death, to the other a fragrance from life to life. Who is sufficient for these things?
472Co 2:17 For we are not, like so many, peddlers of God's word, but as men of sincerity, as commissioned by God, in the sight of God we speak in Christ.
472Co 3:1 Are we beginning to commend ourselves again? Or do we need, as some do, letters of recommendation to you, or from you?
472Co 3:2 You yourselves are our letter of recommendation, written on our hearts, to be known and read by all.
472Co 3:3 And you show that you are a letter from Christ delivered by us, written not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God, not on tablets of stone but on tablets of human hearts.
472Co 3:4 Such is the confidence that we have through Christ toward God.
472Co 3:5 Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything as coming from us, but our sufficiency is from God,
472Co 3:6 who has made us competent to be ministers of a new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit. For the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life.
472Co 3:7 Now if the ministry of death, carved in letters on stone, came with such glory that the Israelites could not gaze at Moses' face because of its glory, which was being brought to an end,
472Co 3:8 will not the ministry of the Spirit have even more glory?
472Co 3:9 For if there was glory in the ministry of condemnation, the ministry of righteousness must far exceed it in glory.
472Co 3:10 Indeed, in this case, what once had glory has come to have no glory at all, because of the glory that surpasses it.
472Co 3:11 For if what was being brought to an end came with glory, much more will what is permanent have glory.
472Co 3:12 Since we have such a hope, we are very bold,
472Co 3:13 not like Moses, who would put a veil over his face so that the Israelites might not gaze at the outcome of what was being brought to an end.
472Co 3:14 But their minds were hardened. For to this day, when they read the old covenant, that same veil remains unlifted, because only through Christ is it taken away.
472Co 3:15 Yes, to this day whenever Moses is read a veil lies over their hearts.
472Co 3:16 But when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.
472Co 3:17 Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.
472Co 3:18 And we all, with unveiled face, beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who is the Spirit.
472Co 4:1 Therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart.
472Co 4:2 But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways. We refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word, but by the open statement of the truth we would commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God.
472Co 4:3 And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only to those who are perishing.
472Co 4:4 In their case the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, to keep them from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ, who is the image of God.
472Co 4:5 For what we proclaim is not ourselves, but Jesus Christ as Lord, with ourselves as your servants for Jesus' sake.
472Co 4:6 For God, who said, "Let light shine out of darkness," has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ.
472Co 4:7 But we have this treasure in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us.
472Co 4:8 We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed; perplexed, but not driven to despair;
472Co 4:9 persecuted, but not forsaken; struck down, but not destroyed;
472Co 4:10 always carrying in the body the death of Jesus, so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies.
472Co 4:11 For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus' sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh.
472Co 4:12 So death is at work in us, but life in you.
472Co 4:13 Since we have the same spirit of faith according to what has been written, "I believed, and so I spoke," we also believe, and so we also speak,
472Co 4:14 knowing that he who raised the Lord Jesus will raise us also with Jesus and bring us with you into his presence.
472Co 4:15 For it is all for your sake, so that as grace extends to more and more people it may increase thanksgiving, to the glory of God.
472Co 4:16 So we do not lose heart. Though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day.
472Co 4:17 For this light momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison,
472Co 4:18 as we look not to the things that are seen but to the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen are eternal.
472Co 5:1 For we know that if the tent that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God, a house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens.
472Co 5:2 For in this tent we groan, longing to put on our heavenly dwelling,
472Co 5:3 if indeed by putting it on we may not be found naked.
472Co 5:4 For while we are still in this tent, we groan, being burdened--not that we would be unclothed, but that we would be further clothed, so that what is mortal may be swallowed up by life.
472Co 5:5 He who has prepared us for this very thing is God, who has given us the Spirit as a guarantee.
472Co 5:6 So we are always of good courage. We know that while we are at home in the body we are away from the Lord,
472Co 5:7 for we walk by faith, not by sight.
472Co 5:8 Yes, we are of good courage, and we would rather be away from the body and at home with the Lord.
472Co 5:9 So whether we are at home or away, we make it our aim to please him.
472Co 5:10 For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil.
472Co 5:11 Therefore, knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others. But what we are is known to God, and I hope it is known also to your conscience.
472Co 5:12 We are not commending ourselves to you again but giving you cause to boast about us, so that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance and not about what is in the heart.
472Co 5:13 For if we are beside ourselves, it is for God; if we are in our right mind, it is for you.
472Co 5:14 For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this: that one has died for all, therefore all have died;
472Co 5:15 and he died for all, that those who live might no longer live for themselves but for him who for their sake died and was raised.
472Co 5:16 From now on, therefore, we regard no one according to the flesh. Even though we once regarded Christ according to the flesh, we regard him thus no longer.
472Co 5:17 Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old has passed away; behold, the new has come.
472Co 5:18 All this is from God, who through Christ reconciled us to himself and gave us the ministry of reconciliation;
472Co 5:19 that is, in Christ God was reconciling the world to himself, not counting their trespasses against them, and entrusting to us the message of reconciliation.
472Co 5:20 Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ, God making his appeal through us. We implore you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
472Co 5:21 For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.
472Co 6:1 Working together with him, then, we appeal to you not to receive the grace of God in vain.
472Co 6:2 For he says, "In a favorable time I listened to you, and in a day of salvation I have helped you." Behold, now is the favorable time; behold, now is the day of salvation.
472Co 6:3 We put no obstacle in anyone's way, so that no fault may be found with our ministry,
472Co 6:4 but as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way: by great endurance, in afflictions, hardships, calamities,
472Co 6:5 beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights, hunger;
472Co 6:6 by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love;
472Co 6:7 by truthful speech, and the power of God; with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand and for the left;
472Co 6:8 through honor and dishonor, through slander and praise. We are treated as impostors, and yet are true;
472Co 6:9 as unknown, and yet well known; as dying, and behold, we live; as punished, and yet not killed;
472Co 6:10 as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing; as poor, yet making many rich; as having nothing, yet possessing everything.
472Co 6:11 We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians; our heart is wide open.
472Co 6:12 You are not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own affections.
472Co 6:13 In return (I speak as to children) widen your hearts also.
472Co 6:14 Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?
472Co 6:15 What accord has Christ with Belial? Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?
472Co 6:16 What agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God; as God said, "I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
472Co 6:17 Therefore go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch no unclean thing; then I will welcome you,
472Co 6:18 and I will be a father to you, and you shall be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty."
472Co 7:1 Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement of body and spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God.
472Co 7:2 Make room in your hearts for us. We have wronged no one, we have corrupted no one, we have taken advantage of no one.
472Co 7:3 I do not say this to condemn you, for I said before that you are in our hearts, to die together and to live together.
472Co 7:4 I am acting with great boldness toward you; I have great pride in you; I am filled with comfort. In all our affliction, I am overflowing with joy.
472Co 7:5 For even when we came into Macedonia, our bodies had no rest, but we were afflicted at every turn--fighting without and fear within.
472Co 7:6 But God, who comforts the downcast, comforted us by the coming of Titus,
472Co 7:7 and not only by his coming but also by the comfort with which he was comforted by you, as he told us of your longing, your mourning, your zeal for me, so that I rejoiced still more.
472Co 7:8 For even if I made you grieve with my letter, I do not regret it--though I did regret it, for I see that that letter grieved you, though only for a while.
472Co 7:9 As it is, I rejoice, not because you were grieved, but because you were grieved into repenting. For you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us.
472Co 7:10 For godly grief produces a repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death.
472Co 7:11 For see what earnestness this godly grief has produced in you, but also what eagerness to clear yourselves, what indignation, what fear, what longing, what zeal, what punishment! At every point you have proved yourselves innocent in the matter.
472Co 7:12 So although I wrote to you, it was not for the sake of the one who did the wrong, nor for the sake of the one who suffered the wrong, but in order that your earnestness for us might be revealed to you in the sight of God.
472Co 7:13 Therefore we are comforted. And besides our own comfort, we rejoiced still more at the joy of Titus, because his spirit has been refreshed by you all.
472Co 7:14 For whatever boasts I made to him about you, I was not put to shame. But just as everything we said to you was true, so also our boasting before Titus has proved true.
472Co 7:15 And his affection for you is even greater, as he remembers the obedience of you all, how you received him with fear and trembling.
472Co 7:16 I rejoice, because I have perfect confidence in you.
472Co 8:1 We want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia,
472Co 8:2 for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.
472Co 8:3 For they gave according to their means, as I can testify, and beyond their means, of their own accord,
472Co 8:4 begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints--
472Co 8:5 and this, not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us.
472Co 8:6 Accordingly, we urged Titus that as he had started, so he should complete among you this act of grace.
472Co 8:7 But as you excel in everything--in faith, in speech, in knowledge, in all earnestness, and in our love for you--see that you excel in this act of grace also.
472Co 8:8 I say this not as a command, but to prove by the earnestness of others that your love also is genuine.
472Co 8:9 For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich.
472Co 8:10 And in this matter I give my judgment: this benefits you, who a year ago started not only to do this work but also to desire to do it.
472Co 8:11 So now finish doing it as well, so that your readiness in desiring it may be matched by your completing it out of what you have.
472Co 8:12 For if the readiness is there, it is acceptable according to what a person has, not according to what he does not have.
472Co 8:13 For I do not mean that others should be eased and you burdened, but that as a matter of fairness
472Co 8:14 your abundance at the present time should supply their need, so that their abundance may supply your need, that there may be fairness.
472Co 8:15 As it is written, "Whoever gathered much had nothing left over, and whoever gathered little had no lack."
472Co 8:16 But thanks be to God, who put into the heart of Titus the same earnest care I have for you.
472Co 8:17 For he not only accepted our appeal, but being himself very earnest he is going to you of his own accord.
472Co 8:18 With him we are sending the brother who is famous among all the churches for his preaching of the gospel.
472Co 8:19 And not only that, but he has been appointed by the churches to travel with us as we carry out this act of grace that is being ministered by us, for the glory of the Lord himself and to show our good will.
472Co 8:20 We take this course so that no one should blame us about this generous gift that is being administered by us,
472Co 8:21 for we aim at what is honorable not only in the Lord's sight but also in the sight of man.
472Co 8:22 And with them we are sending our brother whom we have often tested and found earnest in many matters, but who is now more earnest than ever because of his great confidence in you.
472Co 8:23 As for Titus, he is my partner and fellow worker for your benefit. And as for our brothers, they are messengers of the churches, the glory of Christ.
472Co 8:24 So give proof before the churches of your love and of our boasting about you to these men.
472Co 9:1 Now it is superfluous for me to write to you about the ministry for the saints,
472Co 9:2 for I know your readiness, of which I boast about you to the people of Macedonia, saying that Achaia has been ready since last year. And your zeal has stirred up most of them.
472Co 9:3 But I am sending the brothers so that our boasting about you may not prove empty in this matter, so that you may be ready, as I said you would be.
472Co 9:4 Otherwise, if some Macedonians come with me and find that you are not ready, we would be humiliated--to say nothing of you--for being so confident.
472Co 9:5 So I thought it necessary to urge the brothers to go on ahead to you and arrange in advance for the gift you have promised, so that it may be ready as a willing gift, not as an exaction.
472Co 9:6 The point is this: whoever sows sparingly will also reap sparingly, and whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully.
472Co 9:7 Each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver.
472Co 9:8 And God is able to make all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound in every good work.
472Co 9:9 As it is written, "He has distributed freely, he has given to the poor; his righteousness endures forever."
472Co 9:10 He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness.
472Co 9:11 You will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which through us will produce thanksgiving to God.
472Co 9:12 For the ministry of this service is not only supplying the needs of the saints but is also overflowing in many thanksgivings to God.
472Co 9:13 By their approval of this service, they will glorify God because of your submission flowing from your confession of the gospel of Christ, and the generosity of your contribution for them and for all others,
472Co 9:14 while they long for you and pray for you, because of the surpassing grace of God upon you.
472Co 9:15 Thanks be to God for his inexpressible gift!
472Co 10:1 I, Paul, myself entreat you, by the meekness and gentleness of Christ--I who am humble when face to face with you, but bold toward you when I am away!--
472Co 10:2 I beg of you that when I am present I may not have to show boldness with such confidence as I count on showing against some who suspect us of walking according to the flesh.
472Co 10:3 For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war according to the flesh.
472Co 10:4 For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh but have divine power to destroy strongholds.
472Co 10:5 We destroy arguments and every lofty opinion raised against the knowledge of God, and take every thought captive to obey Christ,
472Co 10:6 being ready to punish every disobedience, when your obedience is complete.
472Co 10:7 Look at what is before your eyes. If anyone is confident that he is Christ's, let him remind himself that just as he is Christ's, so also are we.
472Co 10:8 For even if I boast a little too much of our authority, which the Lord gave for building you up and not for destroying you, I will not be ashamed.
472Co 10:9 I do not want to appear to be frightening you with my letters.
472Co 10:10 For they say, "His letters are weighty and strong, but his bodily presence is weak, and his speech of no account."
472Co 10:11 Let such a person understand that what we say by letter when absent, we do when present.
472Co 10:12 Not that we dare to classify or compare ourselves with some of those who are commending themselves. But when they measure themselves by one another and compare themselves with one another, they are without understanding.
472Co 10:13 But we will not boast beyond limits, but will boast only with regard to the area of influence God assigned to us, to reach even to you.
472Co 10:14 For we are not overextending ourselves, as though we did not reach you. For we were the first to come all the way to you with the gospel of Christ.
472Co 10:15 We do not boast beyond limit in the labors of others. But our hope is that as your faith increases, our area of influence among you may be greatly enlarged,
472Co 10:16 so that we may preach the gospel in lands beyond you, without boasting of work already done in another's area of influence.
472Co 10:17 "Let the one who boasts, boast in the Lord."
472Co 10:18 For it is not the one who commends himself who is approved, but the one whom the Lord commends.
472Co 11:1 I wish you would bear with me in a little foolishness. Do bear with me!
472Co 11:2 For I feel a divine jealousy for you, since I betrothed you to one husband, to present you as a pure virgin to Christ.
472Co 11:3 But I am afraid that as the serpent deceived Eve by his cunning, your thoughts will be led astray from a sincere and pure devotion to Christ.
472Co 11:4 For if someone comes and proclaims another Jesus than the one we proclaimed, or if you receive a different spirit from the one you received, or if you accept a different gospel from the one you accepted, you put up with it readily enough.
472Co 11:5 Indeed, I consider that I am not in the least inferior to these super-apostles.
472Co 11:6 Even if I am unskilled in speaking, I am not so in knowledge; indeed, in every way we have made this plain to you in all things.
472Co 11:7 Or did I commit a sin in humbling myself so that you might be exalted, because I preached God's gospel to you free of charge?
472Co 11:8 I robbed other churches by accepting support from them in order to serve you.
472Co 11:9 And when I was with you and was in need, I did not burden anyone, for the brothers who came from Macedonia supplied my need. So I refrained and will refrain from burdening you in any way.
472Co 11:10 As the truth of Christ is in me, this boasting of mine will not be silenced in the regions of Achaia.
472Co 11:11 And why? Because I do not love you? God knows I do!
472Co 11:12 And what I do I will continue to do, in order to undermine the claim of those who would like to claim that in their boasted mission they work on the same terms as we do.
472Co 11:13 For such men are false apostles, deceitful workmen, disguising themselves as apostles of Christ.
472Co 11:14 And no wonder, for even Satan disguises himself as an angel of light.
472Co 11:15 So it is no surprise if his servants, also, disguise themselves as servants of righteousness. Their end will correspond to their deeds.
472Co 11:16 I repeat, let no one think me foolish. But even if you do, accept me as a fool, so that I too may boast a little.
472Co 11:17 What I am saying with this boastful confidence, I say not with the Lord's authority but as a fool.
472Co 11:18 Since many boast according to the flesh, I too will boast.
472Co 11:19 For you gladly bear with fools, being wise yourselves!
472Co 11:20 For you bear it if someone makes slaves of you, or devours you, or takes advantage of you, or puts on airs, or strikes you in the face.
472Co 11:21 To my shame, I must say, we were too weak for that! But whatever anyone else dares to boast of--I am speaking as a fool--I also dare to boast of that.
472Co 11:22 Are they Hebrews? So am I. Are they Israelites? So am I. Are they offspring of Abraham? So am I.
472Co 11:23 Are they servants of Christ? I am a better one--I am talking like a madman--with far greater labors, far more imprisonments, with countless beatings, and often near death.
472Co 11:24 Five times I received at the hands of the Jews the forty lashes less one.
472Co 11:25 Three times I was beaten with rods. Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked; a night and a day I was adrift at sea;
472Co 11:26 on frequent journeys, in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea, danger from false brothers;
472Co 11:27 in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure.
472Co 11:28 And, apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches.
472Co 11:29 Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is made to fall, and I am not indignant?
472Co 11:30 If I must boast, I will boast of the things that show my weakness.
472Co 11:31 The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, he who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.
472Co 11:32 At Damascus, the governor under King Aretas was guarding the city of Damascus in order to seize me,
472Co 11:33 but I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall and escaped his hands.
472Co 12:1 I must go on boasting. Though there is nothing to be gained by it, I will go on to visions and revelations of the Lord.
472Co 12:2 I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third heaven--whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows.
472Co 12:3 And I know that this man was caught up into paradise--whether in the body or out of the body I do not know, God knows--
472Co 12:4 and he heard things that cannot be told, which man may not utter.
472Co 12:5 On behalf of this man I will boast, but on my own behalf I will not boast, except of my weaknesses.
472Co 12:6 Though if I should wish to boast, I would not be a fool, for I would be speaking the truth. But I refrain from it, so that no one may think more of me than he sees in me or hears from me.
472Co 12:7 So to keep me from becoming conceited because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations, a thorn was given me in the flesh, a messenger of Satan to harass me, to keep me from becoming conceited.
472Co 12:8 Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me.
472Co 12:9 But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness." Therefore I will boast all the more gladly of my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may rest upon me.
472Co 12:10 For the sake of Christ, then, I am content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and calamities. For when I am weak, then I am strong.
472Co 12:11 I have been a fool! You forced me to it, for I ought to have been commended by you. For I was not at all inferior to these super-apostles, even though I am nothing.
472Co 12:12 The signs of a true apostle were performed among you with utmost patience, with signs and wonders and mighty works.
472Co 12:13 For in what were you less favored than the rest of the churches, except that I myself did not burden you? Forgive me this wrong!
472Co 12:14 Here for the third time I am ready to come to you. And I will not be a burden, for I seek not what is yours but you. For children are not obligated to save up for their parents, but parents for their children.
472Co 12:15 I will most gladly spend and be spent for your souls. If I love you more, am I to be loved less?
472Co 12:16 But granting that I myself did not burden you, I was crafty, you say, and got the better of you by deceit.
472Co 12:17 Did I take advantage of you through any of those whom I sent to you?
472Co 12:18 I urged Titus to go, and sent the brother with him. Did Titus take advantage of you? Did we not act in the same spirit? Did we not take the same steps?
472Co 12:19 Have you been thinking all along that we have been defending ourselves to you? It is in the sight of God that we have been speaking in Christ, and all for your upbuilding, beloved.
472Co 12:20 For I fear that perhaps when I come I may find you not as I wish, and that you may find me not as you wish--that perhaps there may be quarreling, jealousy, anger, hostility, slander, gossip, conceit, and disorder.
472Co 12:21 I fear that when I come again my God may humble me before you, and I may have to mourn over many of those who sinned earlier and have not repented of the impurity, sexual immorality, and sensuality that they have practiced.
472Co 13:1 This is the third time I am coming to you. Every charge must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses.
472Co 13:2 I warned those who sinned before and all the others, and I warn them now while absent, as I did when present on my second visit, that if I come again I will not spare them--
472Co 13:3 since you seek proof that Christ is speaking in me. He is not weak in dealing with you, but is powerful among you.
472Co 13:4 For he was crucified in weakness, but lives by the power of God. For we also are weak in him, but in dealing with you we will live with him by the power of God.
472Co 13:5 Examine yourselves, to see whether you are in the faith. Test yourselves. Or do you not realize this about yourselves, that Jesus Christ is in you?--unless indeed you fail to meet the test!
472Co 13:6 I hope you will find out that we have not failed the test.
472Co 13:7 But we pray to God that you may not do wrong--not that we may appear to have met the test, but that you may do what is right, though we may seem to have failed.
472Co 13:8 For we cannot do anything against the truth, but only for the truth.
472Co 13:9 For we are glad when we are weak and you are strong. Your restoration is what we pray for.
472Co 13:10 For this reason I write these things while I am away from you, that when I come I may not have to be severe in my use of the authority that the Lord has given me for building up and not for tearing down.
472Co 13:11 Finally, brothers, rejoice. Aim for restoration, comfort one another, agree with one another, live in peace; and the God of love and peace will be with you.
472Co 13:12 Greet one another with a holy kiss.
472Co 13:13 All the saints greet you.
472Co 13:14 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.

48Gl 1:1 Paul, an apostle--not from men nor through man, but through Jesus Christ and God the Father, who raised him from the dead--
48Gl 1:2 and all the brothers who are with me, To the churches of Galatia:
48Gl 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ,
48Gl 1:4 who gave himself for our sins to deliver us from the present evil age, according to the will of our God and Father,
48Gl 1:5 to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
48Gl 1:6 I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel--
48Gl 1:7 not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ.
48Gl 1:8 But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed.
48Gl 1:9 As we have said before, so now I say again: If anyone is preaching to you a gospel contrary to the one you received, let him be accursed.
48Gl 1:10 For am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I trying to please man? If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ.
48Gl 1:11 For I would have you know, brothers, that the gospel that was preached by me is not man's gospel.
48Gl 1:12 For I did not receive it from any man, nor was I taught it, but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ.
48Gl 1:13 For you have heard of my former life in Judaism, how I persecuted the church of God violently and tried to destroy it.
48Gl 1:14 And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers.
48Gl 1:15 But when he who had set me apart before I was born, and who called me by his grace,
48Gl 1:16 was pleased to reveal his Son to me, in order that I might preach him among the Gentiles, I did not immediately consult with anyone;
48Gl 1:17 nor did I go up to Jerusalem to those who were apostles before me, but I went away into Arabia, and returned again to Damascus.
48Gl 1:18 Then after three years I went up to Jerusalem to visit Cephas and remained with him fifteen days.
48Gl 1:19 But I saw none of the other apostles except James the Lord's brother.
48Gl 1:20 (In what I am writing to you, before God, I do not lie!)
48Gl 1:21 Then I went into the regions of Syria and Cilicia.
48Gl 1:22 And I was still unknown in person to the churches of Judea that are in Christ.
48Gl 1:23 They only were hearing it said, "He who used to persecute us is now preaching the faith he once tried to destroy."
48Gl 1:24 And they glorified God because of me.
48Gl 2:1 Then after fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus along with me.
48Gl 2:2 I went up because of a revelation and set before them (though privately before those who seemed influential) the gospel that I proclaim among the Gentiles, in order to make sure I was not running or had not run in vain.
48Gl 2:3 But even Titus, who was with me, was not forced to be circumcised, though he was a Greek.
48Gl 2:4 Yet because of false brothers secretly brought in--who slipped in to spy out our freedom that we have in Christ Jesus, so that they might bring us into slavery--
48Gl 2:5 to them we did not yield in submission even for a moment, so that the truth of the gospel might be preserved for you.
48Gl 2:6 And from those who seemed to be influential (what they were makes no difference to me; God shows no partiality)--those, I say, who seemed influential added nothing to me.
48Gl 2:7 On the contrary, when they saw that I had been entrusted with the gospel to the uncircumcised, just as Peter had been entrusted with the gospel to the circumcised
48Gl 2:8 (for he who worked through Peter for his apostolic ministry to the circumcised worked also through me for mine to the Gentiles),
48Gl 2:9 and when James and Cephas and John, who seemed to be pillars, perceived the grace that was given to me, they gave the right hand of fellowship to Barnabas and me, that we should go to the Gentiles and they to the circumcised.
48Gl 2:10 Only, they asked us to remember the poor, the very thing I was eager to do.
48Gl 2:11 But when Cephas came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned.
48Gl 2:12 For before certain men came from James, he was eating with the Gentiles; but when they came he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party.
48Gl 2:13 And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically along with him, so that even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy.
48Gl 2:14 But when I saw that their conduct was not in step with the truth of the gospel, I said to Cephas before them all, "If you, though a Jew, live like a Gentile and not like a Jew, how can you force the Gentiles to live like Jews?"
48Gl 2:15 We ourselves are Jews by birth and not Gentile sinners;
48Gl 2:16 yet we know that a person is not justified by works of the law but through faith in Jesus Christ, so we also have believed in Christ Jesus, in order to be justified by faith in Christ and not by works of the law, because by works of the law no one will be justified.
48Gl 2:17 But if, in our endeavor to be justified in Christ, we too were found to be sinners, is Christ then a servant of sin? Certainly not!
48Gl 2:18 For if I rebuild what I tore down, I prove myself to be a transgressor.
48Gl 2:19 For through the law I died to the law, so that I might live to God.
48Gl 2:20 I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ who lives in me. And the life I now live in the flesh I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
48Gl 2:21 I do not nullify the grace of God, for if righteousness were through the law, then Christ died for no purpose.
48Gl 3:1 O foolish Galatians! Who has bewitched you? It was before your eyes that Jesus Christ was publicly portrayed as crucified.
48Gl 3:2 Let me ask you only this: Did you receive the Spirit by works of the law or by hearing with faith?
48Gl 3:3 Are you so foolish? Having begun by the Spirit, are you now being perfected by the flesh?
48Gl 3:4 Did you suffer so many things in vain--if indeed it was in vain?
48Gl 3:5 Does he who supplies the Spirit to you and works miracles among you do so by works of the law, or by hearing with faith--
48Gl 3:6 just as Abraham "believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness"?
48Gl 3:7 Know then that it is those of faith who are the sons of Abraham.
48Gl 3:8 And the Scripture, foreseeing that God would justify the Gentiles by faith, preached the gospel beforehand to Abraham, saying, "In you shall all the nations be blessed."
48Gl 3:9 So then, those who are of faith are blessed along with Abraham, the man of faith.
48Gl 3:10 For all who rely on works of the law are under a curse; for it is written, "Cursed be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the Book of the Law, and do them."
48Gl 3:11 Now it is evident that no one is justified before God by the law, for "The righteous shall live by faith."
48Gl 3:12 But the law is not of faith, rather "The one who does them shall live by them."
48Gl 3:13 Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us--for it is written, "Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree"--
48Gl 3:14 so that in Christ Jesus the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles, so that we might receive the promised Spirit through faith.
48Gl 3:15 To give a human example, brothers: even with a man-made covenant, no one annuls it or adds to it once it has been ratified.
48Gl 3:16 Now the promises were made to Abraham and to his offspring. It does not say, "And to offsprings," referring to many, but referring to one, "And to your offspring," who is Christ.
48Gl 3:17 This is what I mean: the law, which came 430 years afterward, does not annul a covenant previously ratified by God, so as to make the promise void.
48Gl 3:18 For if the inheritance comes by the law, it no longer comes by promise; but God gave it to Abraham by a promise.
48Gl 3:19 Why then the law? It was added because of transgressions, until the offspring should come to whom the promise had been made, and it was put in place through angels by an intermediary.
48Gl 3:20 Now an intermediary implies more than one, but God is one.
48Gl 3:21 Is the law then contrary to the promises of God? Certainly not! For if a law had been given that could give life, then righteousness would indeed be by the law.
48Gl 3:22 But the Scripture imprisoned everything under sin, so that the promise by faith in Jesus Christ might be given to those who believe.
48Gl 3:23 Now before faith came, we were held captive under the law, imprisoned until the coming faith would be revealed.
48Gl 3:24 So then, the law was our guardian until Christ came, in order that we might be justified by faith.
48Gl 3:25 But now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian,
48Gl 3:26 for in Christ Jesus you are all sons of God, through faith.
48Gl 3:27 For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.
48Gl 3:28 There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.
48Gl 3:29 And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise.
48Gl 4:1 I mean that the heir, as long as he is a child, is no different from a slave, though he is the owner of everything,
48Gl 4:2 but he is under guardians and managers until the date set by his father.
48Gl 4:3 In the same way we also, when we were children, were enslaved to the elementary principles of the world.
48Gl 4:4 But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman, born under the law,
48Gl 4:5 to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons.
48Gl 4:6 And because you are sons, God has sent the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying, "Abba! Father!"
48Gl 4:7 So you are no longer a slave, but a son, and if a son, then an heir through God.
48Gl 4:8 Formerly, when you did not know God, you were enslaved to those that by nature are not gods.
48Gl 4:9 But now that you have come to know God, or rather to be known by God, how can you turn back again to the weak and worthless elementary principles of the world, whose slaves you want to be once more?
48Gl 4:10 You observe days and months and seasons and years!
48Gl 4:11 I am afraid I may have labored over you in vain.
48Gl 4:12 Brothers, I entreat you, become as I am, for I also have become as you are. You did me no wrong.
48Gl 4:13 You know it was because of a bodily ailment that I preached the gospel to you at first,
48Gl 4:14 and though my condition was a trial to you, you did not scorn or despise me, but received me as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus.
48Gl 4:15 What then has become of the blessing you felt? For I testify to you that, if possible, you would have gouged out your eyes and given them to me.
48Gl 4:16 Have I then become your enemy by telling you the truth?
48Gl 4:17 They make much of you, but for no good purpose. They want to shut you out, that you may make much of them.
48Gl 4:18 It is always good to be made much of for a good purpose, and not only when I am present with you,
48Gl 4:19 my little children, for whom I am again in the anguish of childbirth until Christ is formed in you!
48Gl 4:20 I wish I could be present with you now and change my tone, for I am perplexed about you.
48Gl 4:21 Tell me, you who desire to be under the law, do you not listen to the law?
48Gl 4:22 For it is written that Abraham had two sons, one by a slave woman and one by a free woman.
48Gl 4:23 But the son of the slave was born according to the flesh, while the son of the free woman was born through promise.
48Gl 4:24 Now this may be interpreted allegorically: these women are two covenants. One is from Mount Sinai, bearing children for slavery; she is Hagar.
48Gl 4:25 Now Hagar is Mount Sinai in Arabia; she corresponds to the present Jerusalem, for she is in slavery with her children.
48Gl 4:26 But the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother.
48Gl 4:27 For it is written, "Rejoice, O barren one who does not bear; break forth and cry aloud, you who are not in labor! For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband."
48Gl 4:28 Now you, brothers, like Isaac, are children of promise.
48Gl 4:29 But just as at that time he who was born according to the flesh persecuted him who was born according to the Spirit, so also it is now.
48Gl 4:30 But what does the Scripture say? "Cast out the slave woman and her son, for the son of the slave woman shall not inherit with the son of the free woman."
48Gl 4:31 So, brothers, we are not children of the slave but of the free woman.
48Gl 5:1 For freedom Christ has set us free; stand firm therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.
48Gl 5:2 Look: I, Paul, say to you that if you accept circumcision, Christ will be of no advantage to you.
48Gl 5:3 I testify again to every man who accepts circumcision that he is obligated to keep the whole law.
48Gl 5:4 You are severed from Christ, you who would be justified by the law; you have fallen away from grace.
48Gl 5:5 For through the Spirit, by faith, we ourselves eagerly wait for the hope of righteousness.
48Gl 5:6 For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision nor uncircumcision counts for anything, but only faith working through love.
48Gl 5:7 You were running well. Who hindered you from obeying the truth?
48Gl 5:8 This persuasion is not from him who calls you.
48Gl 5:9 A little leaven leavens the whole lump.
48Gl 5:10 I have confidence in the Lord that you will take no other view than mine, and the one who is troubling you will bear the penalty, whoever he is.
48Gl 5:11 But if I, brothers, still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted? In that case the offense of the cross has been removed.
48Gl 5:12 I wish those who unsettle you would emasculate themselves!
48Gl 5:13 For you were called to freedom, brothers. Only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another.
48Gl 5:14 For the whole law is fulfilled in one word: "You shall love your neighbor as yourself."
48Gl 5:15 But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another.
48Gl 5:16 But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
48Gl 5:17 For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit, and the desires of the Spirit are against the flesh, for these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do.
48Gl 5:18 But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law.
48Gl 5:19 Now the works of the flesh are evident: sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality,
48Gl 5:20 idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of anger, rivalries, dissensions, divisions,
48Gl 5:21 envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God.
48Gl 5:22 But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness,
48Gl 5:23 gentleness, self-control; against such things there is no law.
48Gl 5:24 And those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.
48Gl 5:25 If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.
48Gl 5:26 Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another.
48Gl 6:1 Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself, lest you too be tempted.
48Gl 6:2 Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ.
48Gl 6:3 For if anyone thinks he is something, when he is nothing, he deceives himself.
48Gl 6:4 But let each one test his own work, and then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor.
48Gl 6:5 For each will have to bear his own load.
48Gl 6:6 One who is taught the word must share all good things with the one who teaches.
48Gl 6:7 Do not be deceived: God is not mocked, for whatever one sows, that will he also reap.
48Gl 6:8 For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption, but the one who sows to the Spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life.
48Gl 6:9 And let us not grow weary of doing good, for in due season we will reap, if we do not give up.
48Gl 6:10 So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith.
48Gl 6:11 See with what large letters I am writing to you with my own hand.
48Gl 6:12 It is those who want to make a good showing in the flesh who would force you to be circumcised, and only in order that they may not be persecuted for the cross of Christ.
48Gl 6:13 For even those who are circumcised do not themselves keep the law, but they desire to have you circumcised that they may boast in your flesh.
48Gl 6:14 But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me, and I to the world.
48Gl 6:15 For neither circumcision counts for anything, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.
48Gl 6:16 And as for all who walk by this rule, peace and mercy be upon them, and upon the Israel of God.
48Gl 6:17 From now on let no one cause me trouble, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus.
48Gl 6:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit, brothers. Amen.

49Eph 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, To the saints who are in Ephesus, and are faithful in Christ Jesus:
49Eph 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49Eph 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places,
49Eph 1:4 even as he chose us in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love
49Eph 1:5 he predestined us for adoption as sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of his will,
49Eph 1:6 to the praise of his glorious grace, with which he has blessed us in the Beloved.
49Eph 1:7 In him we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace,
49Eph 1:8 which he lavished upon us, in all wisdom and insight
49Eph 1:9 making known to us the mystery of his will, according to his purpose, which he set forth in Christ
49Eph 1:10 as a plan for the fullness of time, to unite all things in him, things in heaven and things on earth.
49Eph 1:11 In him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will,
49Eph 1:12 so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory.
49Eph 1:13 In him you also, when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit,
49Eph 1:14 who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it, to the praise of his glory.
49Eph 1:15 For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus and your love toward all the saints,
49Eph 1:16 I do not cease to give thanks for you, remembering you in my prayers,
49Eph 1:17 that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you a spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him,
49Eph 1:18 having the eyes of your hearts enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you, what are the riches of his glorious inheritance in the saints,
49Eph 1:19 and what is the immeasurable greatness of his power toward us who believe, according to the working of his great might
49Eph 1:20 that he worked in Christ when he raised him from the dead and seated him at his right hand in the heavenly places,
49Eph 1:21 far above all rule and authority and power and dominion, and above every name that is named, not only in this age but also in the one to come.
49Eph 1:22 And he put all things under his feet and gave him as head over all things to the church,
49Eph 1:23 which is his body, the fullness of him who fills all in all.
49Eph 2:1 And you were dead in the trespasses and sins
49Eph 2:2 in which you once walked, following the course of this world, following the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that is now at work in the sons of disobedience--
49Eph 2:3 among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind, and were by nature children of wrath, like the rest of mankind.
49Eph 2:4 But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which he loved us,
49Eph 2:5 even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ--by grace you have been saved--
49Eph 2:6 and raised us up with him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus,
49Eph 2:7 so that in the coming ages he might show the immeasurable riches of his grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
49Eph 2:8 For by grace you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing; it is the gift of God,
49Eph 2:9 not a result of works, so that no one may boast.
49Eph 2:10 For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them.
49Eph 2:11 Therefore remember that at one time you Gentiles in the flesh, called "the uncircumcision" by what is called the circumcision, which is made in the flesh by hands--
49Eph 2:12 remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
49Eph 2:13 But now in Christ Jesus you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ.
49Eph 2:14 For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one and has broken down in his flesh the dividing wall of hostility
49Eph 2:15 by abolishing the law of commandments expressed in ordinances, that he might create in himself one new man in place of the two, so making peace,
49Eph 2:16 and might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.
49Eph 2:17 And he came and preached peace to you who were far off and peace to those who were near.
49Eph 2:18 For through him we both have access in one Spirit to the Father.
49Eph 2:19 So then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God,
49Eph 2:20 built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself being the cornerstone,
49Eph 2:21 in whom the whole structure, being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord.
49Eph 2:22 In him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the Spirit.
49Eph 3:1 For this reason I, Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus on behalf of you Gentiles--
49Eph 3:2 assuming that you have heard of the stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you,
49Eph 3:3 how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly.
49Eph 3:4 When you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ,
49Eph 3:5 which was not made known to the sons of men in other generations as it has now been revealed to his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit.
49Eph 3:6 This mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the gospel.
49Eph 3:7 Of this gospel I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace, which was given me by the working of his power.
49Eph 3:8 To me, though I am the very least of all the saints, this grace was given, to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ,
49Eph 3:9 and to bring to light for everyone what is the plan of the mystery hidden for ages in God who created all things,
49Eph 3:10 so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known to the rulers and authorities in the heavenly places.
49Eph 3:11 This was according to the eternal purpose that he has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord,
49Eph 3:12 in whom we have boldness and access with confidence through our faith in him.
49Eph 3:13 So I ask you not to lose heart over what I am suffering for you, which is your glory.
49Eph 3:14 For this reason I bow my knees before the Father,
49Eph 3:15 from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named,
49Eph 3:16 that according to the riches of his glory he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being,
49Eph 3:17 so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith--that you, being rooted and grounded in love,
49Eph 3:18 may have strength to comprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth,
49Eph 3:19 and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God.
49Eph 3:20 Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us,
49Eph 3:21 to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, forever and ever. Amen.
49Eph 4:1 I therefore, a prisoner for the Lord, urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called,
49Eph 4:2 with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love,
49Eph 4:3 eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace.
49Eph 4:4 There is one body and one Spirit--just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call--
49Eph 4:5 one Lord, one faith, one baptism,
49Eph 4:6 one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all.
49Eph 4:7 But grace was given to each one of us according to the measure of Christ's gift.
49Eph 4:8 Therefore it says, "When he ascended on high he led a host of captives, and he gave gifts to men."
49Eph 4:9 (In saying, "He ascended," what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower regions, the earth?
49Eph 4:10 He who descended is the one who also ascended far above all the heavens, that he might fill all things.)
49Eph 4:11 And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers,
49Eph 4:12 to equip the saints for the work of ministry, for building up the body of Christ,
49Eph 4:13 until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ,
49Eph 4:14 so that we may no longer be children, tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning, by craftiness in deceitful schemes.
49Eph 4:15 Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head, into Christ,
49Eph 4:16 from whom the whole body, joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love.
49Eph 4:17 Now this I say and testify in the Lord, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do, in the futility of their minds.
49Eph 4:18 They are darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, due to their hardness of heart.
49Eph 4:19 They have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity.
49Eph 4:20 But that is not the way you learned Christ!--
49Eph 4:21 assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him, as the truth is in Jesus,
49Eph 4:22 to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life and is corrupt through deceitful desires,
49Eph 4:23 and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds,
49Eph 4:24 and to put on the new self, created after the likeness of God in true righteousness and holiness.
49Eph 4:25 Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members one of another.
49Eph 4:26 Be angry and do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your anger,
49Eph 4:27 and give no opportunity to the devil.
49Eph 4:28 Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need.
49Eph 4:29 Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as is good for building up, as fits the occasion, that it may give grace to those who hear.
49Eph 4:30 And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption.
49Eph 4:31 Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice.
49Eph 4:32 Be kind to one another, tenderhearted, forgiving one another, as God in Christ forgave you.
49Eph 5:1 Therefore be imitators of God, as beloved children.
49Eph 5:2 And walk in love, as Christ loved us and gave himself up for us, a fragrant offering and sacrifice to God.
49Eph 5:3 But sexual immorality and all impurity or covetousness must not even be named among you, as is proper among saints.
49Eph 5:4 Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crude joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be thanksgiving.
49Eph 5:5 For you may be sure of this, that everyone who is sexually immoral or impure, or who is covetous (that is, an idolater), has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and God.
49Eph 5:6 Let no one deceive you with empty words, for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
49Eph 5:7 Therefore do not become partners with them;
49Eph 5:8 for at one time you were darkness, but now you are light in the Lord. Walk as children of light
49Eph 5:9 (for the fruit of light is found in all that is good and right and true),
49Eph 5:10 and try to discern what is pleasing to the Lord.
49Eph 5:11 Take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness, but instead expose them.
49Eph 5:12 For it is shameful even to speak of the things that they do in secret.
49Eph 5:13 But when anything is exposed by the light, it becomes visible,
49Eph 5:14 for anything that becomes visible is light. Therefore it says, "Awake, O sleeper, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine on you."
49Eph 5:15 Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise,
49Eph 5:16 making the best use of the time, because the days are evil.
49Eph 5:17 Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is.
49Eph 5:18 And do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery, but be filled with the Spirit,
49Eph 5:19 addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart,
49Eph 5:20 giving thanks always and for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
49Eph 5:21 submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ.
49Eph 5:22 Wives, submit to your own husbands, as to the Lord.
49Eph 5:23 For the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church, his body, and is himself its Savior.
49Eph 5:24 Now as the church submits to Christ, so also wives should submit in everything to their husbands.
49Eph 5:25 Husbands, love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her,
49Eph 5:26 that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word,
49Eph 5:27 so that he might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she might be holy and without blemish.
49Eph 5:28 In the same way husbands should love their wives as their own bodies. He who loves his wife loves himself.
49Eph 5:29 For no one ever hated his own flesh, but nourishes and cherishes it, just as Christ does the church,
49Eph 5:30 because we are members of his body.
49Eph 5:31 "Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh."
49Eph 5:32 This mystery is profound, and I am saying that it refers to Christ and the church.
49Eph 5:33 However, let each one of you love his wife as himself, and let the wife see that she respects her husband.
49Eph 6:1 Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
49Eph 6:2 "Honor your father and mother" (this is the first commandment with a promise),
49Eph 6:3 "that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land."
49Eph 6:4 Fathers, do not provoke your children to anger, but bring them up in the discipline and instruction of the Lord.
49Eph 6:5 Slaves, obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling, with a sincere heart, as you would Christ,
49Eph 6:6 not by the way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart,
49Eph 6:7 rendering service with a good will as to the Lord and not to man,
49Eph 6:8 knowing that whatever good anyone does, this he will receive back from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free.
49Eph 6:9 Masters, do the same to them, and stop your threatening, knowing that he who is both their Master and yours is in heaven, and that there is no partiality with him.
49Eph 6:10 Finally, be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.
49Eph 6:11 Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil.
49Eph 6:12 For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.
49Eph 6:13 Therefore take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand in the evil day, and having done all, to stand firm.
49Eph 6:14 Stand therefore, having fastened on the belt of truth, and having put on the breastplate of righteousness,
49Eph 6:15 and, as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace.
49Eph 6:16 In all circumstances take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one;
49Eph 6:17 and take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God,
49Eph 6:18 praying at all times in the Spirit, with all prayer and supplication. To that end keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints,
49Eph 6:19 and also for me, that words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gospel,
49Eph 6:20 for which I am an ambassador in chains, that I may declare it boldly, as I ought to speak.
49Eph 6:21 So that you also may know how I am and what I am doing, Tychicus the beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord will tell you everything.
49Eph 6:22 I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are, and that he may encourage your hearts.
49Eph 6:23 Peace be to the brothers, and love with faith, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
49Eph 6:24 Grace be with all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love incorruptible.

50Php 1:1 Paul and Timothy, servants of Christ Jesus, To all the saints in Christ Jesus who are at Philippi, with the overseers and deacons:
50Php 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
50Php 1:3 I thank my God in all my remembrance of you,
50Php 1:4 always in every prayer of mine for you all making my prayer with joy,
50Php 1:5 because of your partnership in the gospel from the first day until now.
50Php 1:6 And I am sure of this, that he who began a good work in you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ.
50Php 1:7 It is right for me to feel this way about you all, because I hold you in my heart, for you are all partakers with me of grace, both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel.
50Php 1:8 For God is my witness, how I yearn for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.
50Php 1:9 And it is my prayer that your love may abound more and more, with knowledge and all discernment,
50Php 1:10 so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ,
50Php 1:11 filled with the fruit of righteousness that comes through Jesus Christ, to the glory and praise of God.
50Php 1:12 I want you to know, brothers, that what has happened to me has really served to advance the gospel,
50Php 1:13 so that it has become known throughout the whole imperial guard and to all the rest that my imprisonment is for Christ.
50Php 1:14 And most of the brothers, having become confident in the Lord by my imprisonment, are much more bold to speak the word without fear.
50Php 1:15 Some indeed preach Christ from envy and rivalry, but others from good will.
50Php 1:16 The latter do it out of love, knowing that I am put here for the defense of the gospel.
50Php 1:17 The former proclaim Christ out of rivalry, not sincerely but thinking to afflict me in my imprisonment.
50Php 1:18 What then? Only that in every way, whether in pretense or in truth, Christ is proclaimed, and in that I rejoice. Yes, and I will rejoice,
50Php 1:19 for I know that through your prayers and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ this will turn out for my deliverance,
50Php 1:20 as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but that with full courage now as always Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death.
50Php 1:21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
50Php 1:22 If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me. Yet which I shall choose I cannot tell.
50Php 1:23 I am hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ, for that is far better.
50Php 1:24 But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account.
50Php 1:25 Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all, for your progress and joy in the faith,
50Php 1:26 so that in me you may have ample cause to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again.
50Php 1:27 Only let your manner of life be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, with one mind striving side by side for the faith of the gospel,
50Php 1:28 and not frightened in anything by your opponents. This is a clear sign to them of their destruction, but of your salvation, and that from God.
50Php 1:29 For it has been granted to you that for the sake of Christ you should not only believe in him but also suffer for his sake,
50Php 1:30 engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had and now hear that I still have.
50Php 2:1 So if there is any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the Spirit, any affection and sympathy,
50Php 2:2 complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love, being in full accord and of one mind.
50Php 2:3 Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility count others more significant than yourselves.
50Php 2:4 Let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also to the interests of others.
50Php 2:5 Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus,
50Php 2:6 who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped,
50Php 2:7 but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men.
50Php 2:8 And being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross.
50Php 2:9 Therefore God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name,
50Php 2:10 so that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth,
50Php 2:11 and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father.
50Php 2:12 Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only as in my presence but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling,
50Php 2:13 for it is God who works in you, both to will and to work for his good pleasure.
50Php 2:14 Do all things without grumbling or questioning,
50Php 2:15 that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world,
50Php 2:16 holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain.
50Php 2:17 Even if I am to be poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all.
50Php 2:18 Likewise you also should be glad and rejoice with me.
50Php 2:19 I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you.
50Php 2:20 For I have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare.
50Php 2:21 For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ.
50Php 2:22 But you know Timothy's proven worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel.
50Php 2:23 I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me,
50Php 2:24 and I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also.
50Php 2:25 I have thought it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus my brother and fellow worker and fellow soldier, and your messenger and minister to my need,
50Php 2:26 for he has been longing for you all and has been distressed because you heard that he was ill.
50Php 2:27 Indeed he was ill, near to death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow.
50Php 2:28 I am the more eager to send him, therefore, that you may rejoice at seeing him again, and that I may be less anxious.
50Php 2:29 So receive him in the Lord with all joy, and honor such men,
50Php 2:30 for he nearly died for the work of Christ, risking his life to complete what was lacking in your service to me.
50Php 3:1 Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord. To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you.
50Php 3:2 Look out for the dogs, look out for the evildoers, look out for those who mutilate the flesh.
50Php 3:3 For we are the circumcision, who worship by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus and put no confidence in the flesh--
50Php 3:4 though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also. If anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more:
50Php 3:5 circumcised on the eighth day, of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews; as to the law, a Pharisee;
50Php 3:6 as to zeal, a persecutor of the church; as to righteousness under the law, blameless.
50Php 3:7 But whatever gain I had, I counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
50Php 3:8 Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord. For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ
50Php 3:9 and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness from God that depends on faith--
50Php 3:10 that I may know him and the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death,
50Php 3:11 that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead.
50Php 3:12 Not that I have already obtained this or am already perfect, but I press on to make it my own, because Christ Jesus has made me his own.
50Php 3:13 Brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do: forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead,
50Php 3:14 I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
50Php 3:15 Let those of us who are mature think this way, and if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you.
50Php 3:16 Only let us hold true to what we have attained.
50Php 3:17 Brothers, join in imitating me, and keep your eyes on those who walk according to the example you have in us.
50Php 3:18 For many, of whom I have often told you and now tell you even with tears, walk as enemies of the cross of Christ.
50Php 3:19 Their end is destruction, their god is their belly, and they glory in their shame, with minds set on earthly things.
50Php 3:20 But our citizenship is in heaven, and from it we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ,
50Php 3:21 who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself.
50Php 4:1 Therefore, my brothers, whom I love and long for, my joy and crown, stand firm thus in the Lord, my beloved.
50Php 4:2 I entreat Euodia and I entreat Syntyche to agree in the Lord.
50Php 4:3 Yes, I ask you also, true companion, help these women, who have labored side by side with me in the gospel together with Clement and the rest of my fellow workers, whose names are in the book of life.
50Php 4:4 Rejoice in the Lord always; again I will say, Rejoice.
50Php 4:5 Let your reasonableness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand;
50Php 4:6 do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God.
50Php 4:7 And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
50Php 4:8 Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things.
50Php 4:9 What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me--practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you.
50Php 4:10 I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity.
50Php 4:11 Not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content.
50Php 4:12 I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need.
50Php 4:13 I can do all things through him who strengthens me.
50Php 4:14 Yet it was kind of you to share my trouble.
50Php 4:15 And you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only.
50Php 4:16 Even in Thessalonica you sent me help for my needs once and again.
50Php 4:17 Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit.
50Php 4:18 I have received full payment, and more. I am well supplied, having received from Epaphroditus the gifts you sent, a fragrant offering, a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God.
50Php 4:19 And my God will supply every need of yours according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus.
50Php 4:20 To our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen.
50Php 4:21 Greet every saint in Christ Jesus. The brothers who are with me greet you.
50Php 4:22 All the saints greet you, especially those of Caesar's household.
50Php 4:23 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
51
51Col 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God, and Timothy our brother,
51Col 1:2 To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ at Colossae: Grace to you and peace from God our Father.
51Col 1:3 We always thank God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, when we pray for you,
51Col 1:4 since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and of the love that you have for all the saints,
51Col 1:5 because of the hope laid up for you in heaven. Of this you have heard before in the word of the truth, the gospel,
51Col 1:6 which has come to you, as indeed in the whole world it is bearing fruit and growing--as it also does among you, since the day you heard it and understood the grace of God in truth,
51Col 1:7 just as you learned it from Epaphras our beloved fellow servant. He is a faithful minister of Christ on your behalf
51Col 1:8 and has made known to us your love in the Spirit.
51Col 1:9 And so, from the day we heard, we have not ceased to pray for you, asking that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,
51Col 1:10 so as to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, fully pleasing to him, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God.
51Col 1:11 May you be strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might, for all endurance and patience with joy,
51Col 1:12 giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light.
51Col 1:13 He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son,
51Col 1:14 in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
51Col 1:15 He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.
51Col 1:16 For by him all things were created, in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities--all things were created through him and for him.
51Col 1:17 And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together.
51Col 1:18 And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent.
51Col 1:19 For in him all the fullness of God was pleased to dwell,
51Col 1:20 and through him to reconcile to himself all things, whether on earth or in heaven, making peace by the blood of his cross.
51Col 1:21 And you, who once were alienated and hostile in mind, doing evil deeds,
51Col 1:22 he has now reconciled in his body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless and above reproach before him,
51Col 1:23 if indeed you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been proclaimed in all creation under heaven, and of which I, Paul, became a minister.
51Col 1:24 Now I rejoice in my sufferings for your sake, and in my flesh I am filling up what is lacking in Christ's afflictions for the sake of his body, that is, the church,
51Col 1:25 of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God that was given to me for you, to make the word of God fully known,
51Col 1:26 the mystery hidden for ages and generations but now revealed to his saints.
51Col 1:27 To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory.
51Col 1:28 Him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ.
51Col 1:29 For this I toil, struggling with all his energy that he powerfully works within me.
51Col 2:1 For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you and for those at Laodicea and for all who have not seen me face to face,
51Col 2:2 that their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love, to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ,
51Col 2:3 in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge.
51Col 2:4 I say this in order that no one may delude you with plausible arguments.
51Col 2:5 For though I am absent in body, yet I am with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good order and the firmness of your faith in Christ.
51Col 2:6 Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him,
51Col 2:7 rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving.
51Col 2:8 See to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ.
51Col 2:9 For in him the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily,
51Col 2:10 and you have been filled in him, who is the head of all rule and authority.
51Col 2:11 In him also you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh, by the circumcision of Christ,
51Col 2:12 having been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead.
51Col 2:13 And you, who were dead in your trespasses and the uncircumcision of your flesh, God made alive together with him, having forgiven us all our trespasses,
51Col 2:14 by canceling the record of debt that stood against us with its legal demands. This he set aside, nailing it to the cross.
51Col 2:15 He disarmed the rulers and authorities and put them to open shame, by triumphing over them in him.
51Col 2:16 Therefore let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath.
51Col 2:17 These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.
51Col 2:18 Let no one disqualify you, insisting on asceticism and worship of angels, going on in detail about visions, puffed up without reason by his sensuous mind,
51Col 2:19 and not holding fast to the Head, from whom the whole body, nourished and knit together through its joints and ligaments, grows with a growth that is from God.
51Col 2:20 If with Christ you died to the elemental spirits of the world, why, as if you were still alive in the world, do you submit to regulations--
51Col 2:21 "Do not handle, Do not taste, Do not touch"
51Col 2:22 (referring to things that all perish as they are used)--according to human precepts and teachings?
51Col 2:23 These have indeed an appearance of wisdom in promoting self-made religion and asceticism and severity to the body, but they are of no value in stopping the indulgence of the flesh.
51Col 3:1 If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above, where Christ is, seated at the right hand of God.
51Col 3:2 Set your minds on things that are above, not on things that are on earth.
51Col 3:3 For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
51Col 3:4 When Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with him in glory.
51Col 3:5 Put to death therefore what is earthly in you: sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry.
51Col 3:6 On account of these the wrath of God is coming.
51Col 3:7 In these you too once walked, when you were living in them.
51Col 3:8 But now you must put them all away: anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth.
51Col 3:9 Do not lie to one another, seeing that you have put off the old self with its practices
51Col 3:10 and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its creator.
51Col 3:11 Here there is not Greek and Jew, circumcised and uncircumcised, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free; but Christ is all, and in all.
51Col 3:12 Put on then, as God's chosen ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience,
51Col 3:13 bearing with one another and, if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other; as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive.
51Col 3:14 And above all these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony.
51Col 3:15 And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you were called in one body. And be thankful.
51Col 3:16 Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God.
51Col 3:17 And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him.
51Col 3:18 Wives, submit to your husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
51Col 3:19 Husbands, love your wives, and do not be harsh with them.
51Col 3:20 Children, obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord.
51Col 3:21 Fathers, do not provoke your children, lest they become discouraged.
51Col 3:22 Slaves, obey in everything those who are your earthly masters, not by way of eye-service, as people-pleasers, but with sincerity of heart, fearing the Lord.
51Col 3:23 Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men,
51Col 3:24 knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your reward. You are serving the Lord Christ.
51Col 3:25 For the wrongdoer will be paid back for the wrong he has done, and there is no partiality.
51Col 4:1 Masters, treat your slaves justly and fairly, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven.
51Col 4:2 Continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving.
51Col 4:3 At the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ, on account of which I am in prison--
51Col 4:4 that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak.
51Col 4:5 Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time.
51Col 4:6 Let your speech always be gracious, seasoned with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person.
51Col 4:7 Tychicus will tell you all about my activities. He is a beloved brother and faithful minister and fellow servant in the Lord.
51Col 4:8 I have sent him to you for this very purpose, that you may know how we are and that he may encourage your hearts,
51Col 4:9 and with him Onesimus, our faithful and beloved brother, who is one of you. They will tell you of everything that has taken place here.
51Col 4:10 Aristarchus my fellow prisoner greets you, and Mark the cousin of Barnabas (concerning whom you have received instructions--if he comes to you, welcome him),
51Col 4:11 and Jesus who is called Justus. These are the only men of the circumcision among my fellow workers for the kingdom of God, and they have been a comfort to me.
51Col 4:12 Epaphras, who is one of you, a servant of Christ Jesus, greets you, always struggling on your behalf in his prayers, that you may stand mature and fully assured in all the will of God.
51Col 4:13 For I bear him witness that he has worked hard for you and for those in Laodicea and in Hierapolis.
51Col 4:14 Luke the beloved physician greets you, as does Demas.
51Col 4:15 Give my greetings to the brothers at Laodicea, and to Nympha and the church in her house.
51Col 4:16 And when this letter has been read among you, have it also read in the church of the Laodiceans; and see that you also read the letter from Laodicea.
51Col 4:17 And say to Archippus, "See that you fulfill the ministry that you have received in the Lord."
51Col 4:18 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. Remember my chains. Grace be with you.

521Th 1:1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace.
521Th 1:2 We give thanks to God always for all of you, constantly mentioning you in our prayers,
521Th 1:3 remembering before our God and Father your work of faith and labor of love and steadfastness of hope in our Lord Jesus Christ.
521Th 1:4 For we know, brothers loved by God, that he has chosen you,
521Th 1:5 because our gospel came to you not only in word, but also in power and in the Holy Spirit and with full conviction. You know what kind of men we proved to be among you for your sake.
521Th 1:6 And you became imitators of us and of the Lord, for you received the word in much affliction, with the joy of the Holy Spirit,
521Th 1:7 so that you became an example to all the believers in Macedonia and in Achaia.
521Th 1:8 For not only has the word of the Lord sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere, so that we need not say anything.
521Th 1:9 For they themselves report concerning us the kind of reception we had among you, and how you turned to God from idols to serve the living and true God,
521Th 1:10 and to wait for his Son from heaven, whom he raised from the dead, Jesus who delivers us from the wrath to come.
521Th 2:1 For you yourselves know, brothers, that our coming to you was not in vain.
521Th 2:2 But though we had already suffered and been shamefully treated at Philippi, as you know, we had boldness in our God to declare to you the gospel of God in the midst of much conflict.
521Th 2:3 For our appeal does not spring from error or impurity or any attempt to deceive,
521Th 2:4 but just as we have been approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak, not to please man, but to please God who tests our hearts.
521Th 2:5 For we never came with words of flattery, as you know, nor with a pretext for greed--God is witness.
521Th 2:6 Nor did we seek glory from people, whether from you or from others, though we could have made demands as apostles of Christ.
521Th 2:7 But we were gentle among you, like a nursing mother taking care of her own children.
521Th 2:8 So, being affectionately desirous of you, we were ready to share with you not only the gospel of God but also our own selves, because you had become very dear to us.
521Th 2:9 For you remember, brothers, our labor and toil: we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you, while we proclaimed to you the gospel of God.
521Th 2:10 You are witnesses, and God also, how holy and righteous and blameless was our conduct toward you believers.
521Th 2:11 For you know how, like a father with his children,
521Th 2:12 we exhorted each one of you and encouraged you and charged you to walk in a manner worthy of God, who calls you into his own kingdom and glory.
521Th 2:13 And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you received the word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men but as what it really is, the word of God, which is at work in you believers.
521Th 2:14 For you, brothers, became imitators of the churches of God in Christ Jesus that are in Judea. For you suffered the same things from your own countrymen as they did from the Jews,
521Th 2:15 who killed both the Lord Jesus and the prophets, and drove us out, and displease God and oppose all mankind
521Th 2:16 by hindering us from speaking to the Gentiles that they might be saved--so as always to fill up the measure of their sins. But God's wrath has come upon them at last!
521Th 2:17 But since we were torn away from you, brothers, for a short time, in person not in heart, we endeavored the more eagerly and with great desire to see you face to face,
521Th 2:18 because we wanted to come to you--I, Paul, again and again--but Satan hindered us.
521Th 2:19 For what is our hope or joy or crown of boasting before our Lord Jesus at his coming? Is it not you?
521Th 2:20 For you are our glory and joy.
521Th 3:1 Therefore when we could bear it no longer, we were willing to be left behind at Athens alone,
521Th 3:2 and we sent Timothy, our brother and God's coworker in the gospel of Christ, to establish and exhort you in your faith,
521Th 3:3 that no one be moved by these afflictions. For you yourselves know that we are destined for this.
521Th 3:4 For when we were with you, we kept telling you beforehand that we were to suffer affliction, just as it has come to pass, and just as you know.
521Th 3:5 For this reason, when I could bear it no longer, I sent to learn about your faith, for fear that somehow the tempter had tempted you and our labor would be in vain.
521Th 3:6 But now that Timothy has come to us from you, and has brought us the good news of your faith and love and reported that you always remember us kindly and long to see us, as we long to see you--
521Th 3:7 for this reason, brothers, in all our distress and affliction we have been comforted about you through your faith.
521Th 3:8 For now we live, if you are standing fast in the Lord.
521Th 3:9 For what thanksgiving can we return to God for you, for all the joy that we feel for your sake before our God,
521Th 3:10 as we pray most earnestly night and day that we may see you face to face and supply what is lacking in your faith?
521Th 3:11 Now may our God and Father himself, and our Lord Jesus, direct our way to you,
521Th 3:12 and may the Lord make you increase and abound in love for one another and for all, as we do for you,
521Th 3:13 so that he may establish your hearts blameless in holiness before our God and Father, at the coming of our Lord Jesus with all his saints.
521Th 4:1 Finally, then, brothers, we ask and urge you in the Lord Jesus, that as you received from us how you ought to walk and to please God, just as you are doing, that you do so more and more.
521Th 4:2 For you know what instructions we gave you through the Lord Jesus.
521Th 4:3 For this is the will of God, your sanctification: that you abstain from sexual immorality;
521Th 4:4 that each one of you know how to control his own body in holiness and honor,
521Th 4:5 not in the passion of lust like the Gentiles who do not know God;
521Th 4:6 that no one transgress and wrong his brother in this matter, because the Lord is an avenger in all these things, as we told you beforehand and solemnly warned you.
521Th 4:7 For God has not called us for impurity, but in holiness.
521Th 4:8 Therefore whoever disregards this, disregards not man but God, who gives his Holy Spirit to you.
521Th 4:9 Now concerning brotherly love you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you yourselves have been taught by God to love one another,
521Th 4:10 for that indeed is what you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers, to do this more and more,
521Th 4:11 and to aspire to live quietly, and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands, as we instructed you,
521Th 4:12 so that you may walk properly before outsiders and be dependent on no one.
521Th 4:13 But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.
521Th 4:14 For since we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so, through Jesus, God will bring with him those who have fallen asleep.
521Th 4:15 For this we declare to you by a word from the Lord, that we who are alive, who are left until the coming of the Lord, will not precede those who have fallen asleep.
521Th 4:16 For the Lord himself will descend from heaven with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with the sound of the trumpet of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first.
521Th 4:17 Then we who are alive, who are left, will be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air, and so we will always be with the Lord.
521Th 4:18 Therefore encourage one another with these words.
521Th 5:1 Now concerning the times and the seasons, brothers, you have no need to have anything written to you.
521Th 5:2 For you yourselves are fully aware that the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night.
521Th 5:3 While people are saying, "There is peace and security," then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor pains come upon a pregnant woman, and they will not escape.
521Th 5:4 But you are not in darkness, brothers, for that day to surprise you like a thief.
521Th 5:5 For you are all children of light, children of the day. We are not of the night or of the darkness.
521Th 5:6 So then let us not sleep, as others do, but let us keep awake and be sober.
521Th 5:7 For those who sleep, sleep at night, and those who get drunk, are drunk at night.
521Th 5:8 But since we belong to the day, let us be sober, having put on the breastplate of faith and love, and for a helmet the hope of salvation.
521Th 5:9 For God has not destined us for wrath, but to obtain salvation through our Lord Jesus Christ,
521Th 5:10 who died for us so that whether we are awake or asleep we might live with him.
521Th 5:11 Therefore encourage one another and build one another up, just as you are doing.
521Th 5:12 We ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you and are over you in the Lord and admonish you,
521Th 5:13 and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work. Be at peace among yourselves.
521Th 5:14 And we urge you, brothers, admonish the idle, encourage the fainthearted, help the weak, be patient with them all.
521Th 5:15 See that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone.
521Th 5:16 Rejoice always,
521Th 5:17 pray without ceasing,
521Th 5:18 give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you.
521Th 5:19 Do not quench the Spirit.
521Th 5:20 Do not despise prophecies,
521Th 5:21 but test everything; hold fast what is good.
521Th 5:22 Abstain from every form of evil.
521Th 5:23 Now may the God of peace himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.
521Th 5:24 He who calls you is faithful; he will surely do it.
521Th 5:25 Brothers, pray for us.
521Th 5:26 Greet all the brothers with a holy kiss.
521Th 5:27 I put you under oath before the Lord to have this letter read to all the brothers.
521Th 5:28 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you.
53
532Th 1:1 Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, To the church of the Thessalonians in God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ:
532Th 1:2 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 1:3 We ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers, as is right, because your faith is growing abundantly, and the love of every one of you for one another is increasing.
532Th 1:4 Therefore we ourselves boast about you in the churches of God for your steadfastness and faith in all your persecutions and in the afflictions that you are enduring.
532Th 1:5 This is evidence of the righteous judgment of God, that you may be considered worthy of the kingdom of God, for which you are also suffering--
532Th 1:6 since indeed God considers it just to repay with affliction those who afflict you,
532Th 1:7 and to grant relief to you who are afflicted as well as to us, when the Lord Jesus is revealed from heaven with his mighty angels
532Th 1:8 in flaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus.
532Th 1:9 They will suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might,
532Th 1:10 when he comes on that day to be glorified in his saints, and to be marveled at among all who have believed, because our testimony to you was believed.
532Th 1:11 To this end we always pray for you, that our God may make you worthy of his calling and may fulfill every resolve for good and every work of faith by his power,
532Th 1:12 so that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 2:1 Now concerning the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and our being gathered together to him, we ask you, brothers,
532Th 2:2 not to be quickly shaken in mind or alarmed, either by a spirit or a spoken word, or a letter seeming to be from us, to the effect that the day of the Lord has come.
532Th 2:3 Let no one deceive you in any way. For that day will not come, unless the rebellion comes first, and the man of lawlessness is revealed, the son of destruction,
532Th 2:4 who opposes and exalts himself against every so-called god or object of worship, so that he takes his seat in the temple of God, proclaiming himself to be God.
532Th 2:5 Do you not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things?
532Th 2:6 And you know what is restraining him now so that he may be revealed in his time.
532Th 2:7 For the mystery of lawlessness is already at work. Only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way.
532Th 2:8 And then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of his coming.
532Th 2:9 The coming of the lawless one is by the activity of Satan with all power and false signs and wonders,
532Th 2:10 and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing, because they refused to love the truth and so be saved.
532Th 2:11 Therefore God sends them a strong delusion, so that they may believe what is false,
532Th 2:12 in order that all may be condemned who did not believe the truth but had pleasure in unrighteousness.
532Th 2:13 But we ought always to give thanks to God for you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you as the firstfruits to be saved, through sanctification by the Spirit and belief in the truth.
532Th 2:14 To this he called you through our gospel, so that you may obtain the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.
532Th 2:15 So then, brothers, stand firm and hold to the traditions that you were taught by us, either by our spoken word or by our letter.
532Th 2:16 Now may our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God our Father, who loved us and gave us eternal comfort and good hope through grace,
532Th 2:17 comfort your hearts and establish them in every good work and word.
532Th 3:1 Finally, brothers, pray for us, that the word of the Lord may speed ahead and be honored, as happened among you,
532Th 3:2 and that we may be delivered from wicked and evil men. For not all have faith.
532Th 3:3 But the Lord is faithful. He will establish you and guard you against the evil one.
532Th 3:4 And we have confidence in the Lord about you, that you are doing and will do the things that we command.
532Th 3:5 May the Lord direct your hearts to the love of God and to the steadfastness of Christ.
532Th 3:6 Now we command you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from any brother who is walking in idleness and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us.
532Th 3:7 For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not idle when we were with you,
532Th 3:8 nor did we eat anyone's bread without paying for it, but with toil and labor we worked night and day, that we might not be a burden to any of you.
532Th 3:9 It was not because we do not have that right, but to give you in ourselves an example to imitate.
532Th 3:10 For even when we were with you, we would give you this command: If anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat.
532Th 3:11 For we hear that some among you walk in idleness, not busy at work, but busybodies.
532Th 3:12 Now such persons we command and encourage in the Lord Jesus Christ to do their work quietly and to earn their own living.
532Th 3:13 As for you, brothers, do not grow weary in doing good.
532Th 3:14 If anyone does not obey what we say in this letter, take note of that person, and have nothing to do with him, that he may be ashamed.
532Th 3:15 Do not regard him as an enemy, but warn him as a brother.
532Th 3:16 Now may the Lord of peace himself give you peace at all times in every way. The Lord be with you all.
532Th 3:17 I, Paul, write this greeting with my own hand. This is the sign of genuineness in every letter of mine; it is the way I write.
532Th 3:18 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
54
541Tm 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope,
541Tm 1:2 To Timothy, my true child in the faith: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
541Tm 1:3 As I urged you when I was going to Macedonia, remain at Ephesus so that you may charge certain persons not to teach any different doctrine,
541Tm 1:4 nor to devote themselves to myths and endless genealogies, which promote speculations rather than the stewardship from God that is by faith.
541Tm 1:5 The aim of our charge is love that issues from a pure heart and a good conscience and a sincere faith.
541Tm 1:6 Certain persons, by swerving from these, have wandered away into vain discussion,
541Tm 1:7 desiring to be teachers of the law, without understanding either what they are saying or the things about which they make confident assertions.
541Tm 1:8 Now we know that the law is good, if one uses it lawfully,
541Tm 1:9 understanding this, that the law is not laid down for the just but for the lawless and disobedient, for the ungodly and sinners, for the unholy and profane, for those who strike their fathers and mothers, for murderers,
541Tm 1:10 the sexually immoral, men who practice homosexuality, enslavers, liars, perjurers, and whatever else is contrary to sound doctrine,
541Tm 1:11 in accordance with the gospel of the glory of the blessed God with which I have been entrusted.
541Tm 1:12 I thank him who has given me strength, Christ Jesus our Lord, because he judged me faithful, appointing me to his service,
541Tm 1:13 though formerly I was a blasphemer, persecutor, and insolent opponent. But I received mercy because I had acted ignorantly in unbelief,
541Tm 1:14 and the grace of our Lord overflowed for me with the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
541Tm 1:15 The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost.
541Tm 1:16 But I received mercy for this reason, that in me, as the foremost, Jesus Christ might display his perfect patience as an example to those who were to believe in him for eternal life.
541Tm 1:17 To the King of ages, immortal, invisible, the only God, be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen.
541Tm 1:18 This charge I entrust to you, Timothy, my child, in accordance with the prophecies previously made about you, that by them you may wage the good warfare,
541Tm 1:19 holding faith and a good conscience. By rejecting this, some have made shipwreck of their faith,
541Tm 1:20 among whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander, whom I have handed over to Satan that they may learn not to blaspheme.
541Tm 2:1 First of all, then, I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings be made for all people,
541Tm 2:2 for kings and all who are in high positions, that we may lead a peaceful and quiet life, godly and dignified in every way.
541Tm 2:3 This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God our Savior,
541Tm 2:4 who desires all people to be saved and to come to the knowledge of the truth.
541Tm 2:5 For there is one God, and there is one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus,
541Tm 2:6 who gave himself as a ransom for all, which is the testimony given at the proper time.
541Tm 2:7 For this I was appointed a preacher and an apostle (I am telling the truth, I am not lying), a teacher of the Gentiles in faith and truth.
541Tm 2:8 I desire then that in every place the men should pray, lifting holy hands without anger or quarreling;
541Tm 2:9 likewise also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self-control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire,
541Tm 2:10 but with what is proper for women who profess godliness--with good works.
541Tm 2:11 Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness.
541Tm 2:12 I do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man; rather, she is to remain quiet.
541Tm 2:13 For Adam was formed first, then Eve;
541Tm 2:14 and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor.
541Tm 2:15 Yet she will be saved through childbearing--if they continue in faith and love and holiness, with self-control.
541Tm 3:1 The saying is trustworthy: If anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble task.
541Tm 3:2 Therefore an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach,
541Tm 3:3 not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.
541Tm 3:4 He must manage his own household well, with all dignity keeping his children submissive,
541Tm 3:5 for if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's church?
541Tm 3:6 He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil.
541Tm 3:7 Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace, into a snare of the devil.
541Tm 3:8 Deacons likewise must be dignified, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain.
541Tm 3:9 They must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience.
541Tm 3:10 And let them also be tested first; then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless.
541Tm 3:11 Their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober-minded, faithful in all things.
541Tm 3:12 Let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their own households well.
541Tm 3:13 For those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus.
541Tm 3:14 I hope to come to you soon, but I am writing these things to you so that,
541Tm 3:15 if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth.
541Tm 3:16 Great indeed, we confess, is the mystery of godliness: He was manifested in the flesh, vindicated by the Spirit, seen by angels, proclaimed among the nations, believed on in the world, taken up in glory.
541Tm 4:1 Now the Spirit expressly says that in later times some will depart from the faith by devoting themselves to deceitful spirits and teachings of demons,
541Tm 4:2 through the insincerity of liars whose consciences are seared,
541Tm 4:3 who forbid marriage and require abstinence from foods that God created to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth.
541Tm 4:4 For everything created by God is good, and nothing is to be rejected if it is received with thanksgiving,
541Tm 4:5 for it is made holy by the word of God and prayer.
541Tm 4:6 If you put these things before the brothers, you will be a good servant of Christ Jesus, being trained in the words of the faith and of the good doctrine that you have followed.
541Tm 4:7 Have nothing to do with irreverent, silly myths. Rather train yourself for godliness;
541Tm 4:8 for while bodily training is of some value, godliness is of value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come.
541Tm 4:9 The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance.
541Tm 4:10 For to this end we toil and strive, because we have our hope set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe.
541Tm 4:11 Command and teach these things.
541Tm 4:12 Let no one despise you for your youth, but set the believers an example in speech, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.
541Tm 4:13 Until I come, devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation, to teaching.
541Tm 4:14 Do not neglect the gift you have, which was given you by prophecy when the council of elders laid their hands on you.
541Tm 4:15 Practice these things, immerse yourself in them, so that all may see your progress.
541Tm 4:16 Keep a close watch on yourself and on the teaching. Persist in this, for by so doing you will save both yourself and your hearers.
541Tm 5:1 Do not rebuke an older man but encourage him as you would a father, younger men as brothers,
541Tm 5:2 older women as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity.
541Tm 5:3 Honor widows who are truly widows.
541Tm 5:4 But if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show godliness to their own household and to make some return to their parents, for this is pleasing in the sight of God.
541Tm 5:5 She who is truly a widow, left all alone, has set her hope on God and continues in supplications and prayers night and day,
541Tm 5:6 but she who is self-indulgent is dead even while she lives.
541Tm 5:7 Command these things as well, so that they may be without reproach.
541Tm 5:8 But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.
541Tm 5:9 Let a widow be enrolled if she is not less than sixty years of age, having been the wife of one husband,
541Tm 5:10 and having a reputation for good works: if she has brought up children, has shown hospitality, has washed the feet of the saints, has cared for the afflicted, and has devoted herself to every good work.
541Tm 5:11 But refuse to enroll younger widows, for when their passions draw them away from Christ, they desire to marry
541Tm 5:12 and so incur condemnation for having abandoned their former faith.
541Tm 5:13 Besides that, they learn to be idlers, going about from house to house, and not only idlers, but also gossips and busybodies, saying what they should not.
541Tm 5:14 So I would have younger widows marry, bear children, manage their households, and give the adversary no occasion for slander.
541Tm 5:15 For some have already strayed after Satan.
541Tm 5:16 If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her care for them. Let the church not be burdened, so that it may care for those who are truly widows.
541Tm 5:17 Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in preaching and teaching.
541Tm 5:18 For the Scripture says, "You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain," and, "The laborer deserves his wages."
541Tm 5:19 Do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
541Tm 5:20 As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear.
541Tm 5:21 In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels I charge you to keep these rules without prejudging, doing nothing from partiality.
541Tm 5:22 Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands, nor take part in the sins of others; keep yourself pure.
541Tm 5:23 (No longer drink only water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent ailments.)
541Tm 5:24 The sins of some men are conspicuous, going before them to judgment, but the sins of others appear later.
541Tm 5:25 So also good works are conspicuous, and even those that are not cannot remain hidden.
541Tm 6:1 Let all who are under a yoke as slaves regard their own masters as worthy of all honor, so that the name of God and the teaching may not be reviled.
541Tm 6:2 Those who have believing masters must not be disrespectful on the ground that they are brothers; rather they must serve all the better since those who benefit by their good service are believers and beloved. Teach and urge these things.
541Tm 6:3 If anyone teaches a different doctrine and does not agree with the sound words of our Lord Jesus Christ and the teaching that accords with godliness,
541Tm 6:4 he is puffed up with conceit and understands nothing. He has an unhealthy craving for controversy and for quarrels about words, which produce envy, dissension, slander, evil suspicions,
541Tm 6:5 and constant friction among people who are depraved in mind and deprived of the truth, imagining that godliness is a means of gain.
541Tm 6:6 Now there is great gain in godliness with contentment,
541Tm 6:7 for we brought nothing into the world, and we cannot take anything out of the world.
541Tm 6:8 But if we have food and clothing, with these we will be content.
541Tm 6:9 But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation, into a snare, into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction.
541Tm 6:10 For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evils. It is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pangs.
541Tm 6:11 But as for you, O man of God, flee these things. Pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness.
541Tm 6:12 Fight the good fight of the faith. Take hold of the eternal life to which you were called and about which you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses.
541Tm 6:13 I charge you in the presence of God, who gives life to all things, and of Christ Jesus, who in his testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession,
541Tm 6:14 to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ,
541Tm 6:15 which he will display at the proper time--he who is the blessed and only Sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords,
541Tm 6:16 who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen or can see. To him be honor and eternal dominion. Amen.
541Tm 6:17 As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy.
541Tm 6:18 They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share,
541Tm 6:19 thus storing up treasure for themselves as a good foundation for the future, so that they may take hold of that which is truly life.
541Tm 6:20 O Timothy, guard the deposit entrusted to you. Avoid the irreverent babble and contradictions of what is falsely called "knowledge,"
541Tm 6:21 for by professing it some have swerved from the faith. Grace be with you.
55
552Tm 1:1 Paul, an apostle of Christ Jesus by the will of God according to the promise of the life that is in Christ Jesus,
552Tm 1:2 To Timothy, my beloved child: Grace, mercy, and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Lord.
552Tm 1:3 I thank God whom I serve, as did my ancestors, with a clear conscience, as I remember you constantly in my prayers night and day.
552Tm 1:4 As I remember your tears, I long to see you, that I may be filled with joy.
552Tm 1:5 I am reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois and your mother Eunice and now, I am sure, dwells in you as well.
552Tm 1:6 For this reason I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands,
552Tm 1:7 for God gave us a spirit not of fear but of power and love and self-control.
552Tm 1:8 Therefore do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor of me his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God,
552Tm 1:9 who saved us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began,
552Tm 1:10 and which now has been manifested through the appearing of our Savior Christ Jesus, who abolished death and brought life and immortality to light through the gospel,
552Tm 1:11 for which I was appointed a preacher and apostle and teacher,
552Tm 1:12 which is why I suffer as I do. But I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard until that Day what has been entrusted to me.
552Tm 1:13 Follow the pattern of the sound words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love that are in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 1:14 By the Holy Spirit who dwells within us, guard the good deposit entrusted to you.
552Tm 1:15 You are aware that all who are in Asia turned away from me, among whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes.
552Tm 1:16 May the Lord grant mercy to the household of Onesiphorus, for he often refreshed me and was not ashamed of my chains,
552Tm 1:17 but when he arrived in Rome he searched for me earnestly and found me--
552Tm 1:18 may the Lord grant him to find mercy from the Lord on that Day!--and you well know all the service he rendered at Ephesus.
552Tm 2:1 You then, my child, be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus,
552Tm 2:2 and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also.
552Tm 2:3 Share in suffering as a good soldier of Christ Jesus.
552Tm 2:4 No soldier gets entangled in civilian pursuits, since his aim is to please the one who enlisted him.
552Tm 2:5 An athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules.
552Tm 2:6 It is the hard-working farmer who ought to have the first share of the crops.
552Tm 2:7 Think over what I say, for the Lord will give you understanding in everything.
552Tm 2:8 Remember Jesus Christ, risen from the dead, the offspring of David, as preached in my gospel,
552Tm 2:9 for which I am suffering, bound with chains as a criminal. But the word of God is not bound!
552Tm 2:10 Therefore I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they also may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory.
552Tm 2:11 The saying is trustworthy, for: If we have died with him, we will also live with him;
552Tm 2:12 if we endure, we will also reign with him; if we deny him, he also will deny us;
552Tm 2:13 if we are faithless, he remains faithful-- for he cannot deny himself.
552Tm 2:14 Remind them of these things, and charge them before God not to quarrel about words, which does no good, but only ruins the hearers.
552Tm 2:15 Do your best to present yourself to God as one approved, a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth.
552Tm 2:16 But avoid irreverent babble, for it will lead people into more and more ungodliness,
552Tm 2:17 and their talk will spread like gangrene. Among them are Hymenaeus and Philetus,
552Tm 2:18 who have swerved from the truth, saying that the resurrection has already happened. They are upsetting the faith of some.
552Tm 2:19 But God's firm foundation stands, bearing this seal: "The Lord knows those who are his," and, "Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from iniquity."
552Tm 2:20 Now in a great house there are not only vessels of gold and silver but also of wood and clay, some for honorable use, some for dishonorable.
552Tm 2:21 Therefore, if anyone cleanses himself from what is dishonorable, he will be a vessel for honorable use, set apart as holy, useful to the master of the house, ready for every good work.
552Tm 2:22 So flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure heart.
552Tm 2:23 Have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies; you know that they breed quarrels.
552Tm 2:24 And the Lord's servant must not be quarrelsome but kind to everyone, able to teach, patiently enduring evil,
552Tm 2:25 correcting his opponents with gentleness. God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth,
552Tm 2:26 and they may come to their senses and escape from the snare of the devil, after being captured by him to do his will.
552Tm 3:1 But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty.
552Tm 3:2 For people will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy,
552Tm 3:3 heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self-control, brutal, not loving good,
552Tm 3:4 treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God,
552Tm 3:5 having the appearance of godliness, but denying its power. Avoid such people.
552Tm 3:6 For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women, burdened with sins and led astray by various passions,
552Tm 3:7 always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth.
552Tm 3:8 Just as Jannes and Jambres opposed Moses, so these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith.
552Tm 3:9 But they will not get very far, for their folly will be plain to all, as was that of those two men.
552Tm 3:10 You, however, have followed my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness,
552Tm 3:11 my persecutions and sufferings that happened to me at Antioch, at Iconium, and at Lystra--which persecutions I endured; yet from them all the Lord rescued me.
552Tm 3:12 Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted,
552Tm 3:13 while evil people and impostors will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
552Tm 3:14 But as for you, continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed, knowing from whom you learned it
552Tm 3:15 and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus.
552Tm 3:16 All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness,
552Tm 3:17 that the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.
552Tm 4:1 I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living and the dead, and by his appearing and his kingdom:
552Tm 4:2 preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, and exhort, with complete patience and teaching.
552Tm 4:3 For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears they will accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions,
552Tm 4:4 and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths.
552Tm 4:5 As for you, always be sober-minded, endure suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry.
552Tm 4:6 For I am already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come.
552Tm 4:7 I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith.
552Tm 4:8 Henceforth there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge, will award to me on that Day, and not only to me but also to all who have loved his appearing.
552Tm 4:9 Do your best to come to me soon.
552Tm 4:10 For Demas, in love with this present world, has deserted me and gone to Thessalonica. Crescens has gone to Galatia, Titus to Dalmatia.
552Tm 4:11 Luke alone is with me. Get Mark and bring him with you, for he is very useful to me for ministry.
552Tm 4:12 Tychicus I have sent to Ephesus.
552Tm 4:13 When you come, bring the cloak that I left with Carpus at Troas, also the books, and above all the parchments.
552Tm 4:14 Alexander the coppersmith did me great harm; the Lord will repay him according to his deeds.
552Tm 4:15 Beware of him yourself, for he strongly opposed our message.
552Tm 4:16 At my first defense no one came to stand by me, but all deserted me. May it not be charged against them!
552Tm 4:17 But the Lord stood by me and strengthened me, so that through me the message might be fully proclaimed and all the Gentiles might hear it. So I was rescued from the lion's mouth.
552Tm 4:18 The Lord will rescue me from every evil deed and bring me safely into his heavenly kingdom. To him be the glory forever and ever. Amen.
552Tm 4:19 Greet Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.
552Tm 4:20 Erastus remained at Corinth, and I left Trophimus, who was ill, at Miletus.
552Tm 4:21 Do your best to come before winter. Eubulus sends greetings to you, as do Pudens and Linus and Claudia and all the brothers.
552Tm 4:22 The Lord be with your spirit. Grace be with you.
56
56Ti 1:1 Paul, a servant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the sake of the faith of God's elect and their knowledge of the truth, which accords with godliness,
56Ti 1:2 in hope of eternal life, which God, who never lies, promised before the ages began
56Ti 1:3 and at the proper time manifested in his word through the preaching with which I have been entrusted by the command of God our Savior;
56Ti 1:4 To Titus, my true child in a common faith: Grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior.
56Ti 1:5 This is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you--
56Ti 1:6 if anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, and his children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery or insubordination.
56Ti 1:7 For an overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach. He must not be arrogant or quick-tempered or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain,
56Ti 1:8 but hospitable, a lover of good, self-controlled, upright, holy, and disciplined.
56Ti 1:9 He must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction in sound doctrine and also to rebuke those who contradict it.
56Ti 1:10 For there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision party.
56Ti 1:11 They must be silenced, since they are upsetting whole families by teaching for shameful gain what they ought not to teach.
56Ti 1:12 One of the Cretans, a prophet of their own, said, "Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
56Ti 1:13 This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith,
56Ti 1:14 not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth.
56Ti 1:15 To the pure, all things are pure, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure; but both their minds and their consciences are defiled.
56Ti 1:16 They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work.
56Ti 2:1 But as for you, teach what accords with sound doctrine.
56Ti 2:2 Older men are to be sober-minded, dignified, self-controlled, sound in faith, in love, and in steadfastness.
56Ti 2:3 Older women likewise are to be reverent in behavior, not slanderers or slaves to much wine. They are to teach what is good,
56Ti 2:4 and so train the young women to love their husbands and children,
56Ti 2:5 to be self-controlled, pure, working at home, kind, and submissive to their own husbands, that the word of God may not be reviled.
56Ti 2:6 Likewise, urge the younger men to be self-controlled.
56Ti 2:7 Show yourself in all respects to be a model of good works, and in your teaching show integrity, dignity,
56Ti 2:8 and sound speech that cannot be condemned, so that an opponent may be put to shame, having nothing evil to say about us.
56Ti 2:9 Slaves are to be submissive to their own masters in everything; they are to be well-pleasing, not argumentative,
56Ti 2:10 not pilfering, but showing all good faith, so that in everything they may adorn the doctrine of God our Savior.
56Ti 2:11 For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for all people,
56Ti 2:12 training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self-controlled, upright, and godly lives in the present age,
56Ti 2:13 waiting for our blessed hope, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior Jesus Christ,
56Ti 2:14 who gave himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify for himself a people for his own possession who are zealous for good works.
56Ti 2:15 Declare these things; exhort and rebuke with all authority. Let no one disregard you.
56Ti 3:1 Remind them to be submissive to rulers and authorities, to be obedient, to be ready for every good work,
56Ti 3:2 to speak evil of no one, to avoid quarreling, to be gentle, and to show perfect courtesy toward all people.
56Ti 3:3 For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days in malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another.
56Ti 3:4 But when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared,
56Ti 3:5 he saved us, not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit,
56Ti 3:6 whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior,
56Ti 3:7 so that being justified by his grace we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life.
56Ti 3:8 The saying is trustworthy, and I want you to insist on these things, so that those who have believed in God may be careful to devote themselves to good works. These things are excellent and profitable for people.
56Ti 3:9 But avoid foolish controversies, genealogies, dissensions, and quarrels about the law, for they are unprofitable and worthless.
56Ti 3:10 As for a person who stirs up division, after warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him,
56Ti 3:11 knowing that such a person is warped and sinful; he is self-condemned.
56Ti 3:12 When I send Artemas or Tychicus to you, do your best to come to me at Nicopolis, for I have decided to spend the winter there.
56Ti 3:13 Do your best to speed Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their way; see that they lack nothing.
56Ti 3:14 And let our people learn to devote themselves to good works, so as to help cases of urgent need, and not be unfruitful.
56Ti 3:15 All who are with me send greetings to you. Greet those who love us in the faith. Grace be with you all.
57
57Phm 1:1 Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother, To Philemon our beloved fellow worker
57Phm 1:2 and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house:
57Phm 1:3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.
57Phm 1:4 I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers,
57Phm 1:5 because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints,
57Phm 1:6 and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ.
57Phm 1:7 For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you.
57Phm 1:8 Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required,
57Phm 1:9 yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you--I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus--
57Phm 1:10 I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment.
57Phm 1:11 (Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.)
57Phm 1:12 I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart.
57Phm 1:13 I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel,
57Phm 1:14 but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own accord.
57Phm 1:15 For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever,
57Phm 1:16 no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother--especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord.
57Phm 1:17 So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me.
57Phm 1:18 If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account.
57Phm 1:19 I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it--to say nothing of your owing me even your own self.
57Phm 1:20 Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ.
57Phm 1:21 Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say.
57Phm 1:22 At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you.
57Phm 1:23 Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you,
57Phm 1:24 and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers.
57Phm 1:25 The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit.
58
58Heb 1:1 Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,
58Heb 1:2 but in these last days he has spoken to us by his Son, whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.
58Heb 1:3 He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature, and he upholds the universe by the word of his power. After making purification for sins, he sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high,
58Heb 1:4 having become as much superior to angels as the name he has inherited is more excellent than theirs.
58Heb 1:5 For to which of the angels did God ever say, "You are my Son, today I have begotten you"? Or again, "I will be to him a father, and he shall be to me a son"?
58Heb 1:6 And again, when he brings the firstborn into the world, he says, "Let all God's angels worship him."
58Heb 1:7 Of the angels he says, "He makes his angels winds, and his ministers a flame of fire."
58Heb 1:8 But of the Son he says, "Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of your kingdom.
58Heb 1:9 You have loved righteousness and hated wickedness; therefore God, your God, has anointed you with the oil of gladness beyond your companions."
58Heb 1:10 And, "You, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth in the beginning, and the heavens are the work of your hands;
58Heb 1:11 they will perish, but you remain; they will all wear out like a garment,
58Heb 1:12 like a robe you will roll them up, like a garment they will be changed. But you are the same, and your years will have no end."
58Heb 1:13 And to which of the angels has he ever said, "Sit at my right hand until I make your enemies a footstool for your feet"?
58Heb 1:14 Are they not all ministering spirits sent out to serve for the sake of those who are to inherit salvation?
58Heb 2:1 Therefore we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard, lest we drift away from it.
58Heb 2:2 For since the message declared by angels proved to be reliable, and every transgression or disobedience received a just retribution,
58Heb 2:3 how shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation? It was declared at first by the Lord, and it was attested to us by those who heard,
58Heb 2:4 while God also bore witness by signs and wonders and various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit distributed according to his will.
58Heb 2:5 Now it was not to angels that God subjected the world to come, of which we are speaking.
58Heb 2:6 It has been testified somewhere, "What is man, that you are mindful of him, or the son of man, that you care for him?
58Heb 2:7 You made him for a little while lower than the angels; you have crowned him with glory and honor,
58Heb 2:8 putting everything in subjection under his feet." Now in putting everything in subjection to him, he left nothing outside his control. At present, we do not yet see everything in subjection to him.
58Heb 2:9 But we see him who for a little while was made lower than the angels, namely Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of the suffering of death, so that by the grace of God he might taste death for everyone.
58Heb 2:10 For it was fitting that he, for whom and by whom all things exist, in bringing many sons to glory, should make the founder of their salvation perfect through suffering.
58Heb 2:11 For he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers,
58Heb 2:12 saying, "I will tell of your name to my brothers; in the midst of the congregation I will sing your praise."
58Heb 2:13 And again, "I will put my trust in him." And again, "Behold, I and the children God has given me."
58Heb 2:14 Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things, that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil,
58Heb 2:15 and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery.
58Heb 2:16 For surely it is not angels that he helps, but he helps the offspring of Abraham.
58Heb 2:17 Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful high priest in the service of God, to make propitiation for the sins of the people.
58Heb 2:18 For because he himself has suffered when tempted, he is able to help those who are being tempted.
58Heb 3:1 Therefore, holy brothers, you who share in a heavenly calling, consider Jesus, the apostle and high priest of our confession,
58Heb 3:2 who was faithful to him who appointed him, just as Moses also was faithful in all God's house.
58Heb 3:3 For Jesus has been counted worthy of more glory than Moses--as much more glory as the builder of a house has more honor than the house itself.
58Heb 3:4 (For every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is God.)
58Heb 3:5 Now Moses was faithful in all God's house as a servant, to testify to the things that were to be spoken later,
58Heb 3:6 but Christ is faithful over God's house as a son. And we are his house if indeed we hold fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope.
58Heb 3:7 Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, "Today, if you hear his voice,
58Heb 3:8 do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, on the day of testing in the wilderness,
58Heb 3:9 where your fathers put me to the test and saw my works for forty years.
58Heb 3:10 Therefore I was provoked with that generation, and said, 'They always go astray in their heart; they have not known my ways.'
58Heb 3:11 As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter my rest.'"
58Heb 3:12 Take care, brothers, lest there be in any of you an evil, unbelieving heart, leading you to fall away from the living God.
58Heb 3:13 But exhort one another every day, as long as it is called "today," that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin.
58Heb 3:14 For we have come to share in Christ, if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the end.
58Heb 3:15 As it is said, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion."
58Heb 3:16 For who were those who heard and yet rebelled? Was it not all those who left Egypt led by Moses?
58Heb 3:17 And with whom was he provoked for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose bodies fell in the wilderness?
58Heb 3:18 And to whom did he swear that they would not enter his rest, but to those who were disobedient?
58Heb 3:19 So we see that they were unable to enter because of unbelief.
58Heb 4:1 Therefore, while the promise of entering his rest still stands, let us fear lest any of you should seem to have failed to reach it.
58Heb 4:2 For good news came to us just as to them, but the message they heard did not benefit them, because they were not united by faith with those who listened.
58Heb 4:3 For we who have believed enter that rest, as he has said, "As I swore in my wrath, 'They shall not enter my rest,'" although his works were finished from the foundation of the world.
58Heb 4:4 For he has somewhere spoken of the seventh day in this way: "And God rested on the seventh day from all his works."
58Heb 4:5 And again in this passage he said, "They shall not enter my rest."
58Heb 4:6 Since therefore it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly received the good news failed to enter because of disobedience,
58Heb 4:7 again he appoints a certain day, "Today," saying through David so long afterward, in the words already quoted, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."
58Heb 4:8 For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on.
58Heb 4:9 So then, there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God,
58Heb 4:10 for whoever has entered God's rest has also rested from his works as God did from his.
58Heb 4:11 Let us therefore strive to enter that rest, so that no one may fall by the same sort of disobedience.
58Heb 4:12 For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
58Heb 4:13 And no creature is hidden from his sight, but all are naked and exposed to the eyes of him to whom we must give account.
58Heb 4:14 Since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession.
58Heb 4:15 For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without sin.
58Heb 4:16 Let us then with confidence draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
58Heb 5:1 For every high priest chosen from among men is appointed to act on behalf of men in relation to God, to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins.
58Heb 5:2 He can deal gently with the ignorant and wayward, since he himself is beset with weakness.
58Heb 5:3 Because of this he is obligated to offer sacrifice for his own sins just as he does for those of the people.
58Heb 5:4 And no one takes this honor for himself, but only when called by God, just as Aaron was.
58Heb 5:5 So also Christ did not exalt himself to be made a high priest, but was appointed by him who said to him, "You are my Son, today I have begotten you";
58Heb 5:6 as he says also in another place, "You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek."
58Heb 5:7 In the days of his flesh, Jesus offered up prayers and supplications, with loud cries and tears, to him who was able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his reverence.
58Heb 5:8 Although he was a son, he learned obedience through what he suffered.
58Heb 5:9 And being made perfect, he became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey him,
58Heb 5:10 being designated by God a high priest after the order of Melchizedek.
58Heb 5:11 About this we have much to say, and it is hard to explain, since you have become dull of hearing.
58Heb 5:12 For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk, not solid food,
58Heb 5:13 for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness, since he is a child.
58Heb 5:14 But solid food is for the mature, for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil.
58Heb 6:1 Therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ and go on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God,
58Heb 6:2 and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment.
58Heb 6:3 And this we will do if God permits.
58Heb 6:4 For it is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit,
58Heb 6:5 and have tasted the goodness of the word of God and the powers of the age to come,
58Heb 6:6 and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding him up to contempt.
58Heb 6:7 For land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and produces a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.
58Heb 6:8 But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed, and its end is to be burned.
58Heb 6:9 Though we speak in this way, yet in your case, beloved, we feel sure of better things--things that belong to salvation.
58Heb 6:10 For God is not unjust so as to overlook your work and the love that you have shown for his name in serving the saints, as you still do.
58Heb 6:11 And we desire each one of you to show the same earnestness to have the full assurance of hope until the end,
58Heb 6:12 so that you may not be sluggish, but imitators of those who through faith and patience inherit the promises.
58Heb 6:13 For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear, he swore by himself,
58Heb 6:14 saying, "Surely I will bless you and multiply you."
58Heb 6:15 And thus Abraham, having patiently waited, obtained the promise.
58Heb 6:16 For people swear by something greater than themselves, and in all their disputes an oath is final for confirmation.
58Heb 6:17 So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath,
58Heb 6:18 so that by two unchangeable things, in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us.
58Heb 6:19 We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain,
58Heb 6:20 where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
58Heb 7:1 For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the Most High God, met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
58Heb 7:2 and to him Abraham apportioned a tenth part of everything. He is first, by translation of his name, king of righteousness, and then he is also king of Salem, that is, king of peace.
58Heb 7:3 He is without father or mother or genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but resembling the Son of God he continues a priest forever.
58Heb 7:4 See how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch gave a tenth of the spoils!
58Heb 7:5 And those descendants of Levi who receive the priestly office have a commandment in the law to take tithes from the people, that is, from their brothers, though these also are descended from Abraham.
58Heb 7:6 But this man who does not have his descent from them received tithes from Abraham and blessed him who had the promises.
58Heb 7:7 It is beyond dispute that the inferior is blessed by the superior.
58Heb 7:8 In the one case tithes are received by mortal men, but in the other case, by one of whom it is testified that he lives.
58Heb 7:9 One might even say that Levi himself, who receives tithes, paid tithes through Abraham,
58Heb 7:10 for he was still in the loins of his ancestor when Melchizedek met him.
58Heb 7:11 Now if perfection had been attainable through the Levitical priesthood (for under it the people received the law), what further need would there have been for another priest to arise after the order of Melchizedek, rather than one named after the order of Aaron?
58Heb 7:12 For when there is a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.
58Heb 7:13 For the one of whom these things are spoken belonged to another tribe, from which no one has ever served at the altar.
58Heb 7:14 For it is evident that our Lord was descended from Judah, and in connection with that tribe Moses said nothing about priests.
58Heb 7:15 This becomes even more evident when another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek,
58Heb 7:16 who has become a priest, not on the basis of a legal requirement concerning bodily descent, but by the power of an indestructible life.
58Heb 7:17 For it is witnessed of him, "You are a priest forever, after the order of Melchizedek."
58Heb 7:18 For on the one hand, a former commandment is set aside because of its weakness and uselessness
58Heb 7:19 (for the law made nothing perfect); but on the other hand, a better hope is introduced, through which we draw near to God.
58Heb 7:20 And it was not without an oath. For those who formerly became priests were made such without an oath,
58Heb 7:21 but this one was made a priest with an oath by the one who said to him: "The Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, 'You are a priest forever.'"
58Heb 7:22 This makes Jesus the guarantor of a better covenant.
58Heb 7:23 The former priests were many in number, because they were prevented by death from continuing in office,
58Heb 7:24 but he holds his priesthood permanently, because he continues forever.
58Heb 7:25 Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them.
58Heb 7:26 For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, holy, innocent, unstained, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens.
58Heb 7:27 He has no need, like those high priests, to offer sacrifices daily, first for his own sins and then for those of the people, since he did this once for all when he offered up himself.
58Heb 7:28 For the law appoints men in their weakness as high priests, but the word of the oath, which came later than the law, appoints a Son who has been made perfect forever.
58Heb 8:1 Now the point in what we are saying is this: we have such a high priest, one who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in heaven,
58Heb 8:2 a minister in the holy places, in the true tent that the Lord set up, not man.
58Heb 8:3 For every high priest is appointed to offer gifts and sacrifices; thus it is necessary for this priest also to have something to offer.
58Heb 8:4 Now if he were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are priests who offer gifts according to the law.
58Heb 8:5 They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. For when Moses was about to erect the tent, he was instructed by God, saying, "See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown you on the mountain."
58Heb 8:6 But as it is, Christ has obtained a ministry that is as much more excellent than the old as the covenant he mediates is better, since it is enacted on better promises.
58Heb 8:7 For if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second.
58Heb 8:8 For he finds fault with them when he says: "Behold, the days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will establish a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah,
58Heb 8:9 not like the covenant that I made with their fathers on the day when I took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not continue in my covenant, and so I showed no concern for them, declares the Lord.
58Heb 8:10 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws into their minds, and write them on their hearts, and I will be their God, and they shall be my people.
58Heb 8:11 And they shall not teach, each one his neighbor and each one his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord,' for they shall all know me, from the least of them to the greatest.
58Heb 8:12 For I will be merciful toward their iniquities, and I will remember their sins no more."
58Heb 8:13 In speaking of a new covenant, he makes the first one obsolete. And what is becoming obsolete and growing old is ready to vanish away.
58Heb 9:1 Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly place of holiness.
58Heb 9:2 For a tent was prepared, the first section, in which were the lampstand and the table and the bread of the Presence. It is called the Holy Place.
58Heb 9:3 Behind the second curtain was a second section called the Most Holy Place,
58Heb 9:4 having the golden altar of incense and the ark of the covenant covered on all sides with gold, in which was a golden urn holding the manna, and Aaron's staff that budded, and the tablets of the covenant.
58Heb 9:5 Above it were the cherubim of glory overshadowing the mercy seat. Of these things we cannot now speak in detail.
58Heb 9:6 These preparations having thus been made, the priests go regularly into the first section, performing their ritual duties,
58Heb 9:7 but into the second only the high priest goes, and he but once a year, and not without taking blood, which he offers for himself and for the unintentional sins of the people.
58Heb 9:8 By this the Holy Spirit indicates that the way into the holy places is not yet opened as long as the first section is still standing
58Heb 9:9 (which is symbolic for the present age). According to this arrangement, gifts and sacrifices are offered that cannot perfect the conscience of the worshiper,
58Heb 9:10 but deal only with food and drink and various washings, regulations for the body imposed until the time of reformation.
58Heb 9:11 But when Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things that have come, then through the greater and more perfect tent (not made with hands, that is, not of this creation)
58Heb 9:12 he entered once for all into the holy places, not by means of the blood of goats and calves but by means of his own blood, thus securing an eternal redemption.
58Heb 9:13 For if the blood of goats and bulls, and the sprinkling of defiled persons with the ashes of a heifer, sanctify for the purification of the flesh,
58Heb 9:14 how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself without blemish to God, purify our conscience from dead works to serve the living God.
58Heb 9:15 Therefore he is the mediator of a new covenant, so that those who are called may receive the promised eternal inheritance, since a death has occurred that redeems them from the transgressions committed under the first covenant.
58Heb 9:16 For where a will is involved, the death of the one who made it must be established.
58Heb 9:17 For a will takes effect only at death, since it is not in force as long as the one who made it is alive.
58Heb 9:18 Therefore not even the first covenant was inaugurated without blood.
58Heb 9:19 For when every commandment of the law had been declared by Moses to all the people, he took the blood of calves and goats, with water and scarlet wool and hyssop, and sprinkled both the book itself and all the people,
58Heb 9:20 saying, "This is the blood of the covenant that God commanded for you."
58Heb 9:21 And in the same way he sprinkled with the blood both the tent and all the vessels used in worship.
58Heb 9:22 Indeed, under the law almost everything is purified with blood, and without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins.
58Heb 9:23 Thus it was necessary for the copies of the heavenly things to be purified with these rites, but the heavenly things themselves with better sacrifices than these.
58Heb 9:24 For Christ has entered, not into holy places made with hands, which are copies of the true things, but into heaven itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf.
58Heb 9:25 Nor was it to offer himself repeatedly, as the high priest enters the holy places every year with blood not his own,
58Heb 9:26 for then he would have had to suffer repeatedly since the foundation of the world. But as it is, he has appeared once for all at the end of the ages to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.
58Heb 9:27 And just as it is appointed for man to die once, and after that comes judgment,
58Heb 9:28 so Christ, having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time, not to deal with sin but to save those who are eagerly waiting for him.
58Heb 10:1 For since the law has but a shadow of the good things to come instead of the true form of these realities, it can never, by the same sacrifices that are continually offered every year, make perfect those who draw near.
58Heb 10:2 Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers, having once been cleansed, would no longer have any consciousness of sins?
58Heb 10:3 But in these sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year.
58Heb 10:4 For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
58Heb 10:5 Consequently, when Christ came into the world, he said, "Sacrifices and offerings you have not desired, but a body have you prepared for me;
58Heb 10:6 in burnt offerings and sin offerings you have taken no pleasure.
58Heb 10:7 Then I said, 'Behold, I have come to do your will, O God, as it is written of me in the scroll of the book.'"
58Heb 10:8 When he said above, "You have neither desired nor taken pleasure in sacrifices and offerings and burnt offerings and sin offerings" (these are offered according to the law),
58Heb 10:9 then he added, "Behold, I have come to do your will." He does away with the first in order to establish the second.
58Heb 10:10 And by that will we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.
58Heb 10:11 And every priest stands daily at his service, offering repeatedly the same sacrifices, which can never take away sins.
58Heb 10:12 But when Christ had offered for all time a single sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God,
58Heb 10:13 waiting from that time until his enemies should be made a footstool for his feet.
58Heb 10:14 For by a single offering he has perfected for all time those who are being sanctified.
58Heb 10:15 And the Holy Spirit also bears witness to us; for after saying,
58Heb 10:16 "This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, declares the Lord: I will put my laws on their hearts, and write them on their minds,"
58Heb 10:17 then he adds, "I will remember their sins and their lawless deeds no more."
58Heb 10:18 Where there is forgiveness of these, there is no longer any offering for sin.
58Heb 10:19 Therefore, brothers, since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus,
58Heb 10:20 by the new and living way that he opened for us through the curtain, that is, through his flesh,
58Heb 10:21 and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
58Heb 10:22 let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith, with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.
58Heb 10:23 Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful.
58Heb 10:24 And let us consider how to stir up one another to love and good works,
58Heb 10:25 not neglecting to meet together, as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another, and all the more as you see the Day drawing near.
58Heb 10:26 For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins,
58Heb 10:27 but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries.
58Heb 10:28 Anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy on the evidence of two or three witnesses.
58Heb 10:29 How much worse punishment, do you think, will be deserved by the one who has spurned the Son of God, and has profaned the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and has outraged the Spirit of grace?
58Heb 10:30 For we know him who said, "Vengeance is mine; I will repay." And again, "The Lord will judge his people."
58Heb 10:31 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.
58Heb 10:32 But recall the former days when, after you were enlightened, you endured a hard struggle with sufferings,
58Heb 10:33 sometimes being publicly exposed to reproach and affliction, and sometimes being partners with those so treated.
58Heb 10:34 For you had compassion on those in prison, and you joyfully accepted the plundering of your property, since you knew that you yourselves had a better possession and an abiding one.
58Heb 10:35 Therefore do not throw away your confidence, which has a great reward.
58Heb 10:36 For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God you may receive what is promised.
58Heb 10:37 For, "Yet a little while, and the coming one will come and will not delay;
58Heb 10:38 but my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him."
58Heb 10:39 But we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their souls.
58Heb 11:1 Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen.
58Heb 11:2 For by it the people of old received their commendation.
58Heb 11:3 By faith we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible.
58Heb 11:4 By faith Abel offered to God a more acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous, God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks.
58Heb 11:5 By faith Enoch was taken up so that he should not see death, and he was not found, because God had taken him. Now before he was taken he was commended as having pleased God.
58Heb 11:6 And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he rewards those who seek him.
58Heb 11:7 By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith.
58Heb 11:8 By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And he went out, not knowing where he was going.
58Heb 11:9 By faith he went to live in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, living in tents with Isaac and Jacob, heirs with him of the same promise.
58Heb 11:10 For he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God.
58Heb 11:11 By faith Sarah herself received power to conceive, even when she was past the age, since she considered him faithful who had promised.
58Heb 11:12 Therefore from one man, and him as good as dead, were born descendants as many as the stars of heaven and as many as the innumerable grains of sand by the seashore.
58Heb 11:13 These all died in faith, not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth.
58Heb 11:14 For people who speak thus make it clear that they are seeking a homeland.
58Heb 11:15 If they had been thinking of that land from which they had gone out, they would have had opportunity to return.
58Heb 11:16 But as it is, they desire a better country, that is, a heavenly one. Therefore God is not ashamed to be called their God, for he has prepared for them a city.
58Heb 11:17 By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises was in the act of offering up his only son,
58Heb 11:18 of whom it was said, "Through Isaac shall your offspring be named."
58Heb 11:19 He considered that God was able even to raise him from the dead, from which, figuratively speaking, he did receive him back.
58Heb 11:20 By faith Isaac invoked future blessings on Jacob and Esau.
58Heb 11:21 By faith Jacob, when dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph, bowing in worship over the head of his staff.
58Heb 11:22 By faith Joseph, at the end of his life, made mention of the exodus of the Israelites and gave directions concerning his bones.
58Heb 11:23 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the king's edict.
58Heb 11:24 By faith Moses, when he was grown up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter,
58Heb 11:25 choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God than to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin.
58Heb 11:26 He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward.
58Heb 11:27 By faith he left Egypt, not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible.
58Heb 11:28 By faith he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the Destroyer of the firstborn might not touch them.
58Heb 11:29 By faith the people crossed the Red Sea as on dry land, but the Egyptians, when they attempted to do the same, were drowned.
58Heb 11:30 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they had been encircled for seven days.
58Heb 11:31 By faith Rahab the prostitute did not perish with those who were disobedient, because she had given a friendly welcome to the spies.
58Heb 11:32 And what more shall I say? For time would fail me to tell of Gideon, Barak, Samson, Jephthah, of David and Samuel and the prophets--
58Heb 11:33 who through faith conquered kingdoms, enforced justice, obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions,
58Heb 11:34 quenched the power of fire, escaped the edge of the sword, were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to flight.
58Heb 11:35 Women received back their dead by resurrection. Some were tortured, refusing to accept release, so that they might rise again to a better life.
58Heb 11:36 Others suffered mocking and flogging, and even chains and imprisonment.
58Heb 11:37 They were stoned, they were sawn in two, they were killed with the sword. They went about in skins of sheep and goats, destitute, afflicted, mistreated--
58Heb 11:38 of whom the world was not worthy--wandering about in deserts and mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.
58Heb 11:39 And all these, though commended through their faith, did not receive what was promised,
58Heb 11:40 since God had provided something better for us, that apart from us they should not be made perfect.
58Heb 12:1 Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely, and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us,
58Heb 12:2 looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
58Heb 12:3 Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted.
58Heb 12:4 In your struggle against sin you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.
58Heb 12:5 And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons? "My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him.
58Heb 12:6 For the Lord disciplines the one he loves, and chastises every son whom he receives."
58Heb 12:7 It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons. For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
58Heb 12:8 If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
58Heb 12:9 Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them. Shall we not much more be subject to the Father of spirits and live?
58Heb 12:10 For they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but he disciplines us for our good, that we may share his holiness.
58Heb 12:11 For the moment all discipline seems painful rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it.
58Heb 12:12 Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees,
58Heb 12:13 and make straight paths for your feet, so that what is lame may not be put out of joint but rather be healed.
58Heb 12:14 Strive for peace with everyone, and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
58Heb 12:15 See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God; that no "root of bitterness" springs up and causes trouble, and by it many become defiled;
58Heb 12:16 that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal.
58Heb 12:17 For you know that afterward, when he desired to inherit the blessing, he was rejected, for he found no chance to repent, though he sought it with tears.
58Heb 12:18 For you have not come to what may be touched, a blazing fire and darkness and gloom and a tempest
58Heb 12:19 and the sound of a trumpet and a voice whose words made the hearers beg that no further messages be spoken to them.
58Heb 12:20 For they could not endure the order that was given, "If even a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned."
58Heb 12:21 Indeed, so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, "I tremble with fear."
58Heb 12:22 But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to innumerable angels in festal gathering,
58Heb 12:23 and to the assembly of the firstborn who are enrolled in heaven, and to God, the judge of all, and to the spirits of the righteous made perfect,
58Heb 12:24 and to Jesus, the mediator of a new covenant, and to the sprinkled blood that speaks a better word than the blood of Abel.
58Heb 12:25 See that you do not refuse him who is speaking. For if they did not escape when they refused him who warned them on earth, much less will we escape if we reject him who warns from heaven.
58Heb 12:26 At that time his voice shook the earth, but now he has promised, "Yet once more I will shake not only the earth but also the heavens."
58Heb 12:27 This phrase, "Yet once more," indicates the removal of things that are shaken--that is, things that have been made--in order that the things that cannot be shaken may remain.
58Heb 12:28 Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken, and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship, with reverence and awe,
58Heb 12:29 for our God is a consuming fire.
58Heb 13:1 Let brotherly love continue.
58Heb 13:2 Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers, for thereby some have entertained angels unawares.
58Heb 13:3 Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body.
58Heb 13:4 Let marriage be held in honor among all, and let the marriage bed be undefiled, for God will judge the sexually immoral and adulterous.
58Heb 13:5 Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have, for he has said, "I will never leave you nor forsake you."
58Heb 13:6 So we can confidently say, "The Lord is my helper; I will not fear; what can man do to me?"
58Heb 13:7 Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the word of God. Consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith.
58Heb 13:8 Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
58Heb 13:9 Do not be led away by diverse and strange teachings, for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace, not by foods, which have not benefited those devoted to them.
58Heb 13:10 We have an altar from which those who serve the tent have no right to eat.
58Heb 13:11 For the bodies of those animals whose blood is brought into the holy places by the high priest as a sacrifice for sin are burned outside the camp.
58Heb 13:12 So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through his own blood.
58Heb 13:13 Therefore let us go to him outside the camp and bear the reproach he endured.
58Heb 13:14 For here we have no lasting city, but we seek the city that is to come.
58Heb 13:15 Through him then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is, the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name.
58Heb 13:16 Do not neglect to do good and to share what you have, for such sacrifices are pleasing to God.
58Heb 13:17 Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account. Let them do this with joy and not with groaning, for that would be of no advantage to you.
58Heb 13:18 Pray for us, for we are sure that we have a clear conscience, desiring to act honorably in all things.
58Heb 13:19 I urge you the more earnestly to do this in order that I may be restored to you the sooner.
58Heb 13:20 Now may the God of peace who brought again from the dead our Lord Jesus, the great shepherd of the sheep, by the blood of the eternal covenant,
58Heb 13:21 equip you with everything good that you may do his will, working in us that which is pleasing in his sight, through Jesus Christ, to whom be glory forever and ever. Amen.
58Heb 13:22 I appeal to you, brothers, bear with my word of exhortation, for I have written to you briefly.
58Heb 13:23 You should know that our brother Timothy has been released, with whom I shall see you if he comes soon.
58Heb 13:24 Greet all your leaders and all the saints. Those who come from Italy send you greetings.
58Heb 13:25 Grace be with all of you.

59Jms 1:1 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, To the twelve tribes in the Dispersion: Greetings.
59Jms 1:2 Count it all joy, my brothers, when you meet trials of various kinds,
59Jms 1:3 for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness.
59Jms 1:4 And let steadfastness have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.
59Jms 1:5 If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him.
59Jms 1:6 But let him ask in faith, with no doubting, for the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind.
59Jms 1:7 For that person must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord;
59Jms 1:8 he is a double-minded man, unstable in all his ways.
59Jms 1:9 Let the lowly brother boast in his exaltation,
59Jms 1:10 and the rich in his humiliation, because like a flower of the grass he will pass away.
59Jms 1:11 For the sun rises with its scorching heat and withers the grass; its flower falls, and its beauty perishes. So also will the rich man fade away in the midst of his pursuits.
59Jms 1:12 Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial, for when he has stood the test he will receive the crown of life, which God has promised to those who love him.
59Jms 1:13 Let no one say when he is tempted, "I am being tempted by God," for God cannot be tempted with evil, and he himself tempts no one.
59Jms 1:14 But each person is tempted when he is lured and enticed by his own desire.
59Jms 1:15 Then desire when it has conceived gives birth to sin, and sin when it is fully grown brings forth death.
59Jms 1:16 Do not be deceived, my beloved brothers.
59Jms 1:17 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change.
59Jms 1:18 Of his own will he brought us forth by the word of truth, that we should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.
59Jms 1:19 Know this, my beloved brothers: let every person be quick to hear, slow to speak, slow to anger;
59Jms 1:20 for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God.
59Jms 1:21 Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your souls.
59Jms 1:22 But be doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving yourselves.
59Jms 1:23 For if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer, he is like a man who looks intently at his natural face in a mirror.
59Jms 1:24 For he looks at himself and goes away and at once forgets what he was like.
59Jms 1:25 But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no hearer who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing.
59Jms 1:26 If anyone thinks he is religious and does not bridle his tongue but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless.
59Jms 1:27 Religion that is pure and undefiled before God, the Father, is this: to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world.
59Jms 2:1 My brothers, show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of glory.
59Jms 2:2 For if a man wearing a gold ring and fine clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man in shabby clothing also comes in,
59Jms 2:3 and if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothing and say, "You sit here in a good place," while you say to the poor man, "You stand over there," or, "Sit down at my feet,"
59Jms 2:4 have you not then made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts?
59Jms 2:5 Listen, my beloved brothers, has not God chosen those who are poor in the world to be rich in faith and heirs of the kingdom, which he has promised to those who love him?
59Jms 2:6 But you have dishonored the poor man. Are not the rich the ones who oppress you, and the ones who drag you into court?
59Jms 2:7 Are they not the ones who blaspheme the honorable name by which you were called?
59Jms 2:8 If you really fulfill the royal law according to the Scripture, "You shall love your neighbor as yourself," you are doing well.
59Jms 2:9 But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors.
59Jms 2:10 For whoever keeps the whole law but fails in one point has become accountable for all of it.
59Jms 2:11 For he who said, "Do not commit adultery," also said, "Do not murder." If you do not commit adultery but do murder, you have become a transgressor of the law.
59Jms 2:12 So speak and so act as those who are to be judged under the law of liberty.
59Jms 2:13 For judgment is without mercy to one who has shown no mercy. Mercy triumphs over judgment.
59Jms 2:14 What good is it, my brothers, if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith save him?
59Jms 2:15 If a brother or sister is poorly clothed and lacking in daily food,
59Jms 2:16 and one of you says to them, "Go in peace, be warmed and filled," without giving them the things needed for the body, what good is that?
59Jms 2:17 So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead.
59Jms 2:18 But someone will say, "You have faith and I have works." Show me your faith apart from your works, and I will show you my faith by my works.
59Jms 2:19 You believe that God is one; you do well. Even the demons believe--and shudder!
59Jms 2:20 Do you want to be shown, you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless?
59Jms 2:21 Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar?
59Jms 2:22 You see that faith was active along with his works, and faith was completed by his works;
59Jms 2:23 and the Scripture was fulfilled that says, "Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness"--and he was called a friend of God.
59Jms 2:24 You see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone.
59Jms 2:25 And in the same way was not also Rahab the prostitute justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out by another way?
59Jms 2:26 For as the body apart from the spirit is dead, so also faith apart from works is dead.
59Jms 3:1 Not many of you should become teachers, my brothers, for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness.
59Jms 3:2 For we all stumble in many ways. And if anyone does not stumble in what he says, he is a perfect man, able also to bridle his whole body.
59Jms 3:3 If we put bits into the mouths of horses so that they obey us, we guide their whole bodies as well.
59Jms 3:4 Look at the ships also: though they are so large and are driven by strong winds, they are guided by a very small rudder wherever the will of the pilot directs.
59Jms 3:5 So also the tongue is a small member, yet it boasts of great things. How great a forest is set ablaze by such a small fire!
59Jms 3:6 And the tongue is a fire, a world of unrighteousness. The tongue is set among our members, staining the whole body, setting on fire the entire course of life, and set on fire by hell.
59Jms 3:7 For every kind of beast and bird, of reptile and sea creature, can be tamed and has been tamed by mankind,
59Jms 3:8 but no human being can tame the tongue. It is a restless evil, full of deadly poison.
59Jms 3:9 With it we bless our Lord and Father, and with it we curse people who are made in the likeness of God.
59Jms 3:10 From the same mouth come blessing and cursing. My brothers, these things ought not to be so.
59Jms 3:11 Does a spring pour forth from the same opening both fresh and salt water?
59Jms 3:12 Can a fig tree, my brothers, bear olives, or a grapevine produce figs? Neither can a salt pond yield fresh water.
59Jms 3:13 Who is wise and understanding among you? By his good conduct let him show his works in the meekness of wisdom.
59Jms 3:14 But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth.
59Jms 3:15 This is not the wisdom that comes down from above, but is earthly, unspiritual, demonic.
59Jms 3:16 For where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.
59Jms 3:17 But the wisdom from above is first pure, then peaceable, gentle, open to reason, full of mercy and good fruits, impartial and sincere.
59Jms 3:18 And a harvest of righteousness is sown in peace by those who make peace.
59Jms 4:1 What causes quarrels and what causes fights among you? Is it not this, that your passions are at war within you?
59Jms 4:2 You desire and do not have, so you murder. You covet and cannot obtain, so you fight and quarrel. You do not have, because you do not ask.
59Jms 4:3 You ask and do not receive, because you ask wrongly, to spend it on your passions.
59Jms 4:4 You adulterous people! Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God? Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God.
59Jms 4:5 Or do you suppose it is to no purpose that the Scripture says, "He yearns jealously over the spirit that he has made to dwell in us"?
59Jms 4:6 But he gives more grace. Therefore it says, "God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
59Jms 4:7 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he will flee from you.
59Jms 4:8 Draw near to God, and he will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners, and purify your hearts, you double-minded.
59Jms 4:9 Be wretched and mourn and weep. Let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to gloom.
59Jms 4:10 Humble yourselves before the Lord, and he will exalt you.
59Jms 4:11 Do not speak evil against one another, brothers. The one who speaks against a brother or judges his brother, speaks evil against the law and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you are not a doer of the law but a judge.
59Jms 4:12 There is only one lawgiver and judge, he who is able to save and to destroy. But who are you to judge your neighbor?
59Jms 4:13 Come now, you who say, "Today or tomorrow we will go into such and such a town and spend a year there and trade and make a profit"--
59Jms 4:14 yet you do not know what tomorrow will bring. What is your life? For you are a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes.
59Jms 4:15 Instead you ought to say, "If the Lord wills, we will live and do this or that."
59Jms 4:16 As it is, you boast in your arrogance. All such boasting is evil.
59Jms 4:17 So whoever knows the right thing to do and fails to do it, for him it is sin.
59Jms 5:1 Come now, you rich, weep and howl for the miseries that are coming upon you.
59Jms 5:2 Your riches have rotted and your garments are moth-eaten.
59Jms 5:3 Your gold and silver have corroded, and their corrosion will be evidence against you and will eat your flesh like fire. You have laid up treasure in the last days.
59Jms 5:4 Behold, the wages of the laborers who mowed your fields, which you kept back by fraud, are crying out against you, and the cries of the harvesters have reached the ears of the Lord of hosts.
59Jms 5:5 You have lived on the earth in luxury and in self-indulgence. You have fattened your hearts in a day of slaughter.
59Jms 5:6 You have condemned and murdered the righteous person. He does not resist you.
59Jms 5:7 Be patient, therefore, brothers, until the coming of the Lord. See how the farmer waits for the precious fruit of the earth, being patient about it, until it receives the early and the late rains.
59Jms 5:8 You also, be patient. Establish your hearts, for the coming of the Lord is at hand.
59Jms 5:9 Do not grumble against one another, brothers, so that you may not be judged; behold, the Judge is standing at the door.
59Jms 5:10 As an example of suffering and patience, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord.
59Jms 5:11 Behold, we consider those blessed who remained steadfast. You have heard of the steadfastness of Job, and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate and merciful.
59Jms 5:12 But above all, my brothers, do not swear, either by heaven or by earth or by any other oath, but let your "yes" be yes and your "no" be no, so that you may not fall under condemnation.
59Jms 5:13 Is anyone among you suffering? Let him pray. Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise.
59Jms 5:14 Is anyone among you sick? Let him call for the elders of the church, and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord.
59Jms 5:15 And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven.
59Jms 5:16 Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another, that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working.
59Jms 5:17 Elijah was a man with a nature like ours, and he prayed fervently that it might not rain, and for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth.
59Jms 5:18 Then he prayed again, and heaven gave rain, and the earth bore its fruit.
59Jms 5:19 My brothers, if anyone among you wanders from the truth and someone brings him back,
59Jms 5:20 let him know that whoever brings back a sinner from his wandering will save his soul from death and will cover a multitude of sins.

601Pt 1:1 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who are elect exiles of the dispersion in Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
601Pt 1:2 according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the Spirit, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood: May grace and peace be multiplied to you.
601Pt 1:3 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ! According to his great mercy, he has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
601Pt 1:4 to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, and unfading, kept in heaven for you,
601Pt 1:5 who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time.
601Pt 1:6 In this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been grieved by various trials,
601Pt 1:7 so that the tested genuineness of your faith--more precious than gold that perishes though it is tested by fire--may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
601Pt 1:8 Though you have not seen him, you love him. Though you do not now see him, you believe in him and rejoice with joy that is inexpressible and filled with glory,
601Pt 1:9 obtaining the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls.
601Pt 1:10 Concerning this salvation, the prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be yours searched and inquired carefully,
601Pt 1:11 inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories.
601Pt 1:12 It was revealed to them that they were serving not themselves but you, in the things that have now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look.
601Pt 1:13 Therefore, preparing your minds for action, and being sober-minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ.
601Pt 1:14 As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance,
601Pt 1:15 but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct,
601Pt 1:16 since it is written, "You shall be holy, for I am holy."
601Pt 1:17 And if you call on him as Father who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile,
601Pt 1:18 knowing that you were ransomed from the futile ways inherited from your forefathers, not with perishable things such as silver or gold,
601Pt 1:19 but with the precious blood of Christ, like that of a lamb without blemish or spot.
601Pt 1:20 He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last times for the sake of you
601Pt 1:21 who through him are believers in God, who raised him from the dead and gave him glory, so that your faith and hope are in God.
601Pt 1:22 Having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart,
601Pt 1:23 since you have been born again, not of perishable seed but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God;
601Pt 1:24 for "All flesh is like grass and all its glory like the flower of grass. The grass withers, and the flower falls,
601Pt 1:25 but the word of the Lord remains forever." And this word is the good news that was preached to you.
601Pt 2:1 So put away all malice and all deceit and hypocrisy and envy and all slander.
601Pt 2:2 Like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it you may grow up into salvation--
601Pt 2:3 if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good.
601Pt 2:4 As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men but in the sight of God chosen and precious,
601Pt 2:5 you yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
601Pt 2:6 For it stands in Scripture: "Behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame."
601Pt 2:7 So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone,"
601Pt 2:8 and "A stone of stumbling, and a rock of offense." They stumble because they disobey the word, as they were destined to do.
601Pt 2:9 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light.
601Pt 2:10 Once you were not a people, but now you are God's people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
601Pt 2:11 Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul.
601Pt 2:12 Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.
601Pt 2:13 Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be to the emperor as supreme,
601Pt 2:14 or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those who do good.
601Pt 2:15 For this is the will of God, that by doing good you should put to silence the ignorance of foolish people.
601Pt 2:16 Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover-up for evil, but living as servants of God.
601Pt 2:17 Honor everyone. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honor the emperor.
601Pt 2:18 Servants, be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle but also to the unjust.
601Pt 2:19 For this is a gracious thing, when, mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering unjustly.
601Pt 2:20 For what credit is it if, when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure? But if when you do good and suffer for it you endure, this is a gracious thing in the sight of God.
601Pt 2:21 For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps.
601Pt 2:22 He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
601Pt 2:23 When he was reviled, he did not revile in return; when he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly.
601Pt 2:24 He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. By his wounds you have been healed.
601Pt 2:25 For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and Overseer of your souls.
601Pt 3:1 Likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be won without a word by the conduct of their wives,
601Pt 3:2 when they see your respectful and pure conduct.
601Pt 3:3 Do not let your adorning be external--the braiding of hair and the putting on of gold jewelry, or the clothing you wear--
601Pt 3:4 but let your adorning be the hidden person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious.
601Pt 3:5 For this is how the holy women who hoped in God used to adorn themselves, by submitting to their own husbands,
601Pt 3:6 as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord. And you are her children, if you do good and do not fear anything that is frightening.
601Pt 3:7 Likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered.
601Pt 3:8 Finally, all of you, have unity of mind, sympathy, brotherly love, a tender heart, and a humble mind.
601Pt 3:9 Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary, bless, for to this you were called, that you may obtain a blessing.
601Pt 3:10 For "Whoever desires to love life and see good days, let him keep his tongue from evil and his lips from speaking deceit;
601Pt 3:11 let him turn away from evil and do good; let him seek peace and pursue it.
601Pt 3:12 For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous, and his ears are open to their prayer. But the face of the Lord is against those who do evil."
601Pt 3:13 Now who is there to harm you if you are zealous for what is good?
601Pt 3:14 But even if you should suffer for righteousness' sake, you will be blessed. Have no fear of them, nor be troubled,
601Pt 3:15 but in your hearts honor Christ the Lord as holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asks you for a reason for the hope that is in you; yet do it with gentleness and respect,
601Pt 3:16 having a good conscience, so that, when you are slandered, those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame.
601Pt 3:17 For it is better to suffer for doing good, if that should be God's will, than for doing evil.
601Pt 3:18 For Christ also suffered once for sins, the righteous for the unrighteous, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in the flesh but made alive in the spirit,
601Pt 3:19 in which he went and proclaimed to the spirits in prison,
601Pt 3:20 because they formerly did not obey, when God's patience waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was being prepared, in which a few, that is, eight persons, were brought safely through water.
601Pt 3:21 Baptism, which corresponds to this, now saves you, not as a removal of dirt from the body but as an appeal to God for a good conscience, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ,
601Pt 3:22 who has gone into heaven and is at the right hand of God, with angels, authorities, and powers having been subjected to him.
601Pt 4:1 Since therefore Christ suffered in the flesh, arm yourselves with the same way of thinking, for whoever has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin,
601Pt 4:2 so as to live for the rest of the time in the flesh no longer for human passions but for the will of God.
601Pt 4:3 For the time that is past suffices for doing what the Gentiles want to do, living in sensuality, passions, drunkenness, orgies, drinking parties, and lawless idolatry.
601Pt 4:4 With respect to this they are surprised when you do not join them in the same flood of debauchery, and they malign you;
601Pt 4:5 but they will give account to him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
601Pt 4:6 For this is why the gospel was preached even to those who are dead, that though judged in the flesh the way people are, they might live in the spirit the way God does.
601Pt 4:7 The end of all things is at hand; therefore be self-controlled and sober-minded for the sake of your prayers.
601Pt 4:8 Above all, keep loving one another earnestly, since love covers a multitude of sins.
601Pt 4:9 Show hospitality to one another without grumbling.
601Pt 4:10 As each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace:
601Pt 4:11 whoever speaks, as one who speaks oracles of God; whoever serves, as one who serves by the strength that God supplies--in order that in everything God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. To him belong glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
601Pt 4:12 Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery trial when it comes upon you to test you, as though something strange were happening to you.
601Pt 4:13 But rejoice insofar as you share Christ's sufferings, that you may also rejoice and be glad when his glory is revealed.
601Pt 4:14 If you are insulted for the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.
601Pt 4:15 But let none of you suffer as a murderer or a thief or an evildoer or as a meddler.
601Pt 4:16 Yet if anyone suffers as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in that name.
601Pt 4:17 For it is time for judgment to begin at the household of God; and if it begins with us, what will be the outcome for those who do not obey the gospel of God?
601Pt 4:18 And "If the righteous is scarcely saved, what will become of the ungodly and the sinner?"
601Pt 4:19 Therefore let those who suffer according to God's will entrust their souls to a faithful Creator while doing good.
601Pt 5:1 So I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well as a partaker in the glory that is going to be revealed:
601Pt 5:2 shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, as God would have you; not for shameful gain, but eagerly;
601Pt 5:3 not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock.
601Pt 5:4 And when the chief Shepherd appears, you will receive the unfading crown of glory.
601Pt 5:5 Likewise, you who are younger, be subject to the elders. Clothe yourselves, all of you, with humility toward one another, for "God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble."
601Pt 5:6 Humble yourselves, therefore, under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time he may exalt you,
601Pt 5:7 casting all your anxieties on him, because he cares for you.
601Pt 5:8 Be sober-minded; be watchful. Your adversary the devil prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour.
601Pt 5:9 Resist him, firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world.
601Pt 5:10 And after you have suffered a little while, the God of all grace, who has called you to his eternal glory in Christ, will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you.
601Pt 5:11 To him be the dominion forever and ever. Amen.
601Pt 5:12 By Silvanus, a faithful brother as I regard him, I have written briefly to you, exhorting and declaring that this is the true grace of God. Stand firm in it.
601Pt 5:13 She who is at Babylon, who is likewise chosen, sends you greetings, and so does Mark, my son.
601Pt 5:14 Greet one another with the kiss of love. Peace to all of you who are in Christ.
61
612Pt 1:1 Simeon Peter, a servant and apostle of Jesus Christ, To those who have obtained a faith of equal standing with ours by the righteousness of our God and Savior Jesus Christ:
612Pt 1:2 May grace and peace be multiplied to you in the knowledge of God and of Jesus our Lord.
612Pt 1:3 His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness, through the knowledge of him who called us to his own glory and excellence,
612Pt 1:4 by which he has granted to us his precious and very great promises, so that through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.
612Pt 1:5 For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue, and virtue with knowledge,
612Pt 1:6 and knowledge with self-control, and self-control with steadfastness, and steadfastness with godliness,
612Pt 1:7 and godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love.
612Pt 1:8 For if these qualities are yours and are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.
612Pt 1:9 For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sins.
612Pt 1:10 Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to make your calling and election sure, for if you practice these qualities you will never fall.
612Pt 1:11 For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
612Pt 1:12 Therefore I intend always to remind you of these qualities, though you know them and are established in the truth that you have.
612Pt 1:13 I think it right, as long as I am in this body, to stir you up by way of reminder,
612Pt 1:14 since I know that the putting off of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.
612Pt 1:15 And I will make every effort so that after my departure you may be able at any time to recall these things.
612Pt 1:16 For we did not follow cleverly devised myths when we made known to you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, but we were eyewitnesses of his majesty.
612Pt 1:17 For when he received honor and glory from God the Father, and the voice was borne to him by the Majestic Glory, "This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased,"
612Pt 1:18 we ourselves heard this very voice borne from heaven, for we were with him on the holy mountain.
612Pt 1:19 And we have something more sure, the prophetic word, to which you will do well to pay attention as to a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts,
612Pt 1:20 knowing this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation.
612Pt 1:21 For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man, but men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
612Pt 2:1 But false prophets also arose among the people, just as there will be false teachers among you, who will secretly bring in destructive heresies, even denying the Master who bought them, bringing upon themselves swift destruction.
612Pt 2:2 And many will follow their sensuality, and because of them the way of truth will be blasphemed.
612Pt 2:3 And in their greed they will exploit you with false words. Their condemnation from long ago is not idle, and their destruction is not asleep.
612Pt 2:4 For if God did not spare angels when they sinned, but cast them into hell and committed them to chains of gloomy darkness to be kept until the judgment;
612Pt 2:5 if he did not spare the ancient world, but preserved Noah, a herald of righteousness, with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly;
612Pt 2:6 if by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes he condemned them to extinction, making them an example of what is going to happen to the ungodly;
612Pt 2:7 and if he rescued righteous Lot, greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked
612Pt 2:8 (for as that righteous man lived among them day after day, he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard);
612Pt 2:9 then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment,
612Pt 2:10 and especially those who indulge in the lust of defiling passion and despise authority. Bold and willful, they do not tremble as they blaspheme the glorious ones,
612Pt 2:11 whereas angels, though greater in might and power, do not pronounce a blasphemous judgment against them before the Lord.
612Pt 2:12 But these, like irrational animals, creatures of instinct, born to be caught and destroyed, blaspheming about matters of which they are ignorant, will also be destroyed in their destruction,
612Pt 2:13 suffering wrong as the wage for their wrongdoing. They count it pleasure to revel in the daytime. They are blots and blemishes, reveling in their deceptions, while they feast with you.
612Pt 2:14 They have eyes full of adultery, insatiable for sin. They entice unsteady souls. They have hearts trained in greed. Accursed children!
612Pt 2:15 Forsaking the right way, they have gone astray. They have followed the way of Balaam, the son of Beor, who loved gain from wrongdoing,
612Pt 2:16 but was rebuked for his own transgression; a speechless donkey spoke with human voice and restrained the prophet's madness.
612Pt 2:17 These are waterless springs and mists driven by a storm. For them the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved.
612Pt 2:18 For, speaking loud boasts of folly, they entice by sensual passions of the flesh those who are barely escaping from those who live in error.
612Pt 2:19 They promise them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person, to that he is enslaved.
612Pt 2:20 For if, after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome, the last state has become worse for them than the first.
612Pt 2:21 For it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness than after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them.
612Pt 2:22 What the true proverb says has happened to them: "The dog returns to its own vomit, and the sow, after washing herself, returns to wallow in the mire."
612Pt 3:1 This is now the second letter that I am writing to you, beloved. In both of them I am stirring up your sincere mind by way of reminder,
612Pt 3:2 that you should remember the predictions of the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles,
612Pt 3:3 knowing this first of all, that scoffers will come in the last days with scoffing, following their own sinful desires.
612Pt 3:4 They will say, "Where is the promise of his coming? For ever since the fathers fell asleep, all things are continuing as they were from the beginning of creation."
612Pt 3:5 For they deliberately overlook this fact, that the heavens existed long ago, and the earth was formed out of water and through water by the word of God,
612Pt 3:6 and that by means of these the world that then existed was deluged with water and perished.
612Pt 3:7 But by the same word the heavens and earth that now exist are stored up for fire, being kept until the day of judgment and destruction of the ungodly.
612Pt 3:8 But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day.
612Pt 3:9 The Lord is not slow to fulfill his promise as some count slowness, but is patient toward you, not wishing that any should perish, but that all should reach repentance.
612Pt 3:10 But the day of the Lord will come like a thief, and then the heavens will pass away with a roar, and the heavenly bodies will be burned up and dissolved, and the earth and the works that are done on it will be exposed.
612Pt 3:11 Since all these things are thus to be dissolved, what sort of people ought you to be in lives of holiness and godliness,
612Pt 3:12 waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be set on fire and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies will melt as they burn!
612Pt 3:13 But according to his promise we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.
612Pt 3:14 Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these, be diligent to be found by him without spot or blemish, and at peace.
612Pt 3:15 And count the patience of our Lord as salvation, just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him,
612Pt 3:16 as he does in all his letters when he speaks in them of these matters. There are some things in them that are hard to understand, which the ignorant and unstable twist to their own destruction, as they do the other Scriptures.
612Pt 3:17 You therefore, beloved, knowing this beforehand, take care that you are not carried away with the error of lawless people and lose your own stability.
612Pt 3:18 But grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. To him be the glory both now and to the day of eternity. Amen.

621Jn 1:1 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which we have seen with our eyes, which we looked upon and have touched with our hands, concerning the word of life--
621Jn 1:2 the life was made manifest, and we have seen it, and testify to it and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was made manifest to us--
621Jn 1:3 that which we have seen and heard we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us; and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son Jesus Christ.
621Jn 1:4 And we are writing these things so that our joy may be complete.
621Jn 1:5 This is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all.
621Jn 1:6 If we say we have fellowship with him while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth.
621Jn 1:7 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus his Son cleanses us from all sin.
621Jn 1:8 If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.
621Jn 1:9 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.
621Jn 1:10 If we say we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his word is not in us.
621Jn 2:1 My little children, I am writing these things to you so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the righteous.
621Jn 2:2 He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world.
621Jn 2:3 And by this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments.
621Jn 2:4 Whoever says "I know him" but does not keep his commandments is a liar, and the truth is not in him,
621Jn 2:5 but whoever keeps his word, in him truly the love of God is perfected. By this we may know that we are in him:
621Jn 2:6 whoever says he abides in him ought to walk in the same way in which he walked.
621Jn 2:7 Beloved, I am writing you no new commandment, but an old commandment that you had from the beginning. The old commandment is the word that you have heard.
621Jn 2:8 At the same time, it is a new commandment that I am writing to you, which is true in him and in you, because the darkness is passing away and the true light is already shining.
621Jn 2:9 Whoever says he is in the light and hates his brother is still in darkness.
621Jn 2:10 Whoever loves his brother abides in the light, and in him there is no cause for stumbling.
621Jn 2:11 But whoever hates his brother is in the darkness and walks in the darkness, and does not know where he is going, because the darkness has blinded his eyes.
621Jn 2:12 I am writing to you, little children, because your sins are forgiven for his name's sake.
621Jn 2:13 I am writing to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I am writing to you, young men, because you have overcome the evil one. I write to you, children, because you know the Father.
621Jn 2:14 I write to you, fathers, because you know him who is from the beginning. I write to you, young men, because you are strong, and the word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the evil one.
621Jn 2:15 Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him.
621Jn 2:16 For all that is in the world--the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and pride in possessions--is not from the Father but is from the world.
621Jn 2:17 And the world is passing away along with its desires, but whoever does the will of God abides forever.
621Jn 2:18 Children, it is the last hour, and as you have heard that antichrist is coming, so now many antichrists have come. Therefore we know that it is the last hour.
621Jn 2:19 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they had been of us, they would have continued with us. But they went out, that it might become plain that they all are not of us.
621Jn 2:20 But you have been anointed by the Holy One, and you all have knowledge.
621Jn 2:21 I write to you, not because you do not know the truth, but because you know it, and because no lie is of the truth.
621Jn 2:22 Who is the liar but he who denies that Jesus is the Christ? This is the antichrist, he who denies the Father and the Son.
621Jn 2:23 No one who denies the Son has the Father. Whoever confesses the Son has the Father also.
621Jn 2:24 Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you. If what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too will abide in the Son and in the Father.
621Jn 2:25 And this is the promise that he made to us--eternal life.
621Jn 2:26 I write these things to you about those who are trying to deceive you.
621Jn 2:27 But the anointing that you received from him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone should teach you. But as his anointing teaches you about everything, and is true, and is no lie--just as it has taught you, abide in him.
621Jn 2:28 And now, little children, abide in him, so that when he appears we may have confidence and not shrink from him in shame at his coming.
621Jn 2:29 If you know that he is righteous, you may be sure that everyone who practices righteousness has been born of him.
621Jn 3:1 See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and so we are. The reason why the world does not know us is that it did not know him.
621Jn 3:2 Beloved, we are God's children now, and what we will be has not yet appeared; but we know that when he appears we shall be like him, because we shall see him as he is.
621Jn 3:3 And everyone who thus hopes in him purifies himself as he is pure.
621Jn 3:4 Everyone who makes a practice of sinning also practices lawlessness; sin is lawlessness.
621Jn 3:5 You know that he appeared to take away sins, and in him there is no sin.
621Jn 3:6 No one who abides in him keeps on sinning; no one who keeps on sinning has either seen him or known him.
621Jn 3:7 Little children, let no one deceive you. Whoever practices righteousness is righteous, as he is righteous.
621Jn 3:8 Whoever makes a practice of sinning is of the devil, for the devil has been sinning from the beginning. The reason the Son of God appeared was to destroy the works of the devil.
621Jn 3:9 No one born of God makes a practice of sinning, for God's seed abides in him, and he cannot keep on sinning because he has been born of God.
621Jn 3:10 By this it is evident who are the children of God, and who are the children of the devil: whoever does not practice righteousness is not of God, nor is the one who does not love his brother.
621Jn 3:11 For this is the message that you have heard from the beginning, that we should love one another.
621Jn 3:12 We should not be like Cain, who was of the evil one and murdered his brother. And why did he murder him? Because his own deeds were evil and his brother's righteous.
621Jn 3:13 Do not be surprised, brothers, that the world hates you.
621Jn 3:14 We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers. Whoever does not love abides in death.
621Jn 3:15 Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal life abiding in him.
621Jn 3:16 By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers.
621Jn 3:17 But if anyone has the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him?
621Jn 3:18 Little children, let us not love in word or talk but in deed and in truth.
621Jn 3:19 By this we shall know that we are of the truth and reassure our heart before him;
621Jn 3:20 for whenever our heart condemns us, God is greater than our heart, and he knows everything.
621Jn 3:21 Beloved, if our heart does not condemn us, we have confidence before God;
621Jn 3:22 and whatever we ask we receive from him, because we keep his commandments and do what pleases him.
621Jn 3:23 And this is his commandment, that we believe in the name of his Son Jesus Christ and love one another, just as he has commanded us.
621Jn 3:24 Whoever keeps his commandments abides in God, and God in him. And by this we know that he abides in us, by the Spirit whom he has given us.
621Jn 4:1 Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God, for many false prophets have gone out into the world.
621Jn 4:2 By this you know the Spirit of God: every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God,
621Jn 4:3 and every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already.
621Jn 4:4 Little children, you are from God and have overcome them, for he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.
621Jn 4:5 They are from the world; therefore they speak from the world, and the world listens to them.
621Jn 4:6 We are from God. Whoever knows God listens to us; whoever is not from God does not listen to us. By this we know the Spirit of truth and the spirit of error.
621Jn 4:7 Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God, and whoever loves has been born of God and knows God.
621Jn 4:8 Anyone who does not love does not know God, because God is love.
621Jn 4:9 In this the love of God was made manifest among us, that God sent his only Son into the world, so that we might live through him.
621Jn 4:10 In this is love, not that we have loved God but that he loved us and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.
621Jn 4:11 Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another.
621Jn 4:12 No one has ever seen God; if we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us.
621Jn 4:13 By this we know that we abide in him and he in us, because he has given us of his Spirit.
621Jn 4:14 And we have seen and testify that the Father has sent his Son to be the Savior of the world.
621Jn 4:15 Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God.
621Jn 4:16 So we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love, and whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him.
621Jn 4:17 By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is so also are we in this world.
621Jn 4:18 There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear. For fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected in love.
621Jn 4:19 We love because he first loved us.
621Jn 4:20 If anyone says, "I love God," and hates his brother, he is a liar; for he who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.
621Jn 4:21 And this commandment we have from him: whoever loves God must also love his brother.
621Jn 5:1 Everyone who believes that Jesus is the Christ has been born of God, and everyone who loves the Father loves whoever has been born of him.
621Jn 5:2 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love God and obey his commandments.
621Jn 5:3 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments. And his commandments are not burdensome.
621Jn 5:4 For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world--our faith.
621Jn 5:5 Who is it that overcomes the world except the one who believes that Jesus is the Son of God?
621Jn 5:6 This is he who came by water and blood--Jesus Christ; not by the water only but by the water and the blood. And the Spirit is the one who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.
621Jn 5:7 For there are three that testify:
621Jn 5:8 the Spirit and the water and the blood; and these three agree.
621Jn 5:9 If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater, for this is the testimony of God that he has borne concerning his Son.
621Jn 5:10 Whoever believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself. Whoever does not believe God has made him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony that God has borne concerning his Son.
621Jn 5:11 And this is the testimony, that God gave us eternal life, and this life is in his Son.
621Jn 5:12 Whoever has the Son has life; whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life.
621Jn 5:13 I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God that you may know that you have eternal life.
621Jn 5:14 And this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to his will he hears us.
621Jn 5:15 And if we know that he hears us in whatever we ask, we know that we have the requests that we have asked of him.
621Jn 5:16 If anyone sees his brother committing a sin not leading to death, he shall ask, and God will give him life--to those who commit sins that do not lead to death. There is sin that leads to death; I do not say that one should pray for that.
621Jn 5:17 All wrongdoing is sin, but there is sin that does not lead to death.
621Jn 5:18 We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.
621Jn 5:19 We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one.
621Jn 5:20 And we know that the Son of God has come and has given us understanding, so that we may know him who is true; and we are in him who is true, in his Son Jesus Christ. He is the true God and eternal life.
621Jn 5:21 Little children, keep yourselves from idols.

632Jn 1:1 The elder to the elect lady and her children, whom I love in truth, and not only I, but also all who know the truth,
632Jn 1:2 because of the truth that abides in us and will be with us forever:
632Jn 1:3 Grace, mercy, and peace will be with us, from God the Father and from Jesus Christ the Father's Son, in truth and love.
632Jn 1:4 I rejoiced greatly to find some of your children walking in the truth, just as we were commanded by the Father.
632Jn 1:5 And now I ask you, dear lady--not as though I were writing you a new commandment, but the one we have had from the beginning--that we love one another.
632Jn 1:6 And this is love, that we walk according to his commandments; this is the commandment, just as you have heard from the beginning, so that you should walk in it.
632Jn 1:7 For many deceivers have gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a one is the deceiver and the antichrist.
632Jn 1:8 Watch yourselves, so that you may not lose what we have worked for, but may win a full reward.
632Jn 1:9 Everyone who goes on ahead and does not abide in the teaching of Christ, does not have God. Whoever abides in the teaching has both the Father and the Son.
632Jn 1:10 If anyone comes to you and does not bring this teaching, do not receive him into your house or give him any greeting,
632Jn 1:11 for whoever greets him takes part in his wicked works.
632Jn 1:12 Though I have much to write to you, I would rather not use paper and ink. Instead I hope to come to you and talk face to face, so that our joy may be complete.
632Jn 1:13 The children of your elect sister greet you.
64
643Jn 1:1 The elder to the beloved Gaius, whom I love in truth.
643Jn 1:2 Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul.
643Jn 1:3 For I rejoiced greatly when the brothers came and testified to your truth, as indeed you are walking in the truth.
643Jn 1:4 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in the truth.
643Jn 1:5 Beloved, it is a faithful thing you do in all your efforts for these brothers, strangers as they are,
643Jn 1:6 who testified to your love before the church. You will do well to send them on their journey in a manner worthy of God.
643Jn 1:7 For they have gone out for the sake of the name, accepting nothing from the Gentiles.
643Jn 1:8 Therefore we ought to support people like these, that we may be fellow workers for the truth.
643Jn 1:9 I have written something to the church, but Diotrephes, who likes to put himself first, does not acknowledge our authority.
643Jn 1:10 So if I come, I will bring up what he is doing, talking wicked nonsense against us. And not content with that, he refuses to welcome the brothers, and also stops those who want to and puts them out of the church.
643Jn 1:11 Beloved, do not imitate evil but imitate good. Whoever does good is from God; whoever does evil has not seen God.
643Jn 1:12 Demetrius has received a good testimony from everyone, and from the truth itself. We also add our testimony, and you know that our testimony is true.
643Jn 1:13 I had much to write to you, but I would rather not write with pen and ink.
643Jn 1:14 I hope to see you soon, and we will talk face to face.
643Jn 1:15 Peace be to you. The friends greet you. Greet the friends, every one of them.

65Jd 1:1 Jude, a servant of Jesus Christ and brother of James, To those who are called, beloved in God the Father and kept for Jesus Christ:
65Jd 1:2 May mercy, peace, and love be multiplied to you.
65Jd 1:3 Beloved, although I was very eager to write to you about our common salvation, I found it necessary to write appealing to you to contend for the faith that was once for all delivered to the saints.
65Jd 1:4 For certain people have crept in unnoticed who long ago were designated for this condemnation, ungodly people, who pervert the grace of our God into sensuality and deny our only Master and Lord, Jesus Christ.
65Jd 1:5 Now I want to remind you, although you once fully knew it, that Jesus, who saved a people out of the land of Egypt, afterward destroyed those who did not believe.
65Jd 1:6 And the angels who did not stay within their own position of authority, but left their proper dwelling, he has kept in eternal chains under gloomy darkness until the judgment of the great day--
65Jd 1:7 just as Sodom and Gomorrah and the surrounding cities, which likewise indulged in sexual immorality and pursued unnatural desire, serve as an example by undergoing a punishment of eternal fire.
65Jd 1:8 Yet in like manner these people also, relying on their dreams, defile the flesh, reject authority, and blaspheme the glorious ones.
65Jd 1:9 But when the archangel Michael, contending with the devil, was disputing about the body of Moses, he did not presume to pronounce a blasphemous judgment, but said, "The Lord rebuke you."
65Jd 1:10 But these people blaspheme all that they do not understand, and they are destroyed by all that they, like unreasoning animals, understand instinctively.
65Jd 1:11 Woe to them! For they walked in the way of Cain and abandoned themselves for the sake of gain to Balaam's error and perished in Korah's rebellion.
65Jd 1:12 These are hidden reefs at your love feasts, as they feast with you without fear, shepherds feeding themselves; waterless clouds, swept along by winds; fruitless trees in late autumn, twice dead, uprooted;
65Jd 1:13 wild waves of the sea, casting up the foam of their own shame; wandering stars, for whom the gloom of utter darkness has been reserved forever.
65Jd 1:14 It was also about these that Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied, saying, "Behold, the Lord comes with ten thousands of his holy ones,
65Jd 1:15 to execute judgment on all and to convict all the ungodly of all their deeds of ungodliness that they have committed in such an ungodly way, and of all the harsh things that ungodly sinners have spoken against him."
65Jd 1:16 These are grumblers, malcontents, following their own sinful desires; they are loud-mouthed boasters, showing favoritism to gain advantage.
65Jd 1:17 But you must remember, beloved, the predictions of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ.
65Jd 1:18 They said to you, "In the last time there will be scoffers, following their own ungodly passions."
65Jd 1:19 It is these who cause divisions, worldly people, devoid of the Spirit.
65Jd 1:20 But you, beloved, building yourselves up in your most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit,
65Jd 1:21 keep yourselves in the love of God, waiting for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ that leads to eternal life.
65Jd 1:22 And have mercy on those who doubt;
65Jd 1:23 save others by snatching them out of the fire; to others show mercy with fear, hating even the garment stained by the flesh.
65Jd 1:24 Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling and to present you blameless before the presence of his glory with great joy,
65Jd 1:25 to the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority, before all time and now and forever. Amen.

66Rv 1:1 The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his servants the things that must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John,
66Rv 1:2 who bore witness to the word of God and to the testimony of Jesus Christ, even to all that he saw.
66Rv 1:3 Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of this prophecy, and blessed are those who hear, and who keep what is written in it, for the time is near.
66Rv 1:4 John to the seven churches that are in Asia: Grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come, and from the seven spirits who are before his throne,
66Rv 1:5 and from Jesus Christ the faithful witness, the firstborn of the dead, and the ruler of kings on earth. To him who loves us and has freed us from our sins by his blood
66Rv 1:6 and made us a kingdom, priests to his God and Father, to him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen.
66Rv 1:7 Behold, he is coming with the clouds, and every eye will see him, even those who pierced him, and all tribes of the earth will wail on account of him. Even so. Amen.
66Rv 1:8 "I am the Alpha and the Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who was and who is to come, the Almighty."
66Rv 1:9 I, John, your brother and partner in the tribulation and the kingdom and the patient endurance that are in Jesus, was on the island called Patmos on account of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus.
66Rv 1:10 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and I heard behind me a loud voice like a trumpet
66Rv 1:11 saying, "Write what you see in a book and send it to the seven churches, to Ephesus and to Smyrna and to Pergamum and to Thyatira and to Sardis and to Philadelphia and to Laodicea."
66Rv 1:12 Then I turned to see the voice that was speaking to me, and on turning I saw seven golden lampstands,
66Rv 1:13 and in the midst of the lampstands one like a son of man, clothed with a long robe and with a golden sash around his chest.
66Rv 1:14 The hairs of his head were white, like white wool, like snow. His eyes were like a flame of fire,
66Rv 1:15 his feet were like burnished bronze, refined in a furnace, and his voice was like the roar of many waters.
66Rv 1:16 In his right hand he held seven stars, from his mouth came a sharp two-edged sword, and his face was like the sun shining in full strength.
66Rv 1:17 When I saw him, I fell at his feet as though dead. But he laid his right hand on me, saying, "Fear not, I am the first and the last,
66Rv 1:18 and the living one. I died, and behold I am alive forevermore, and I have the keys of Death and Hades.
66Rv 1:19 Write therefore the things that you have seen, those that are and those that are to take place after this.
66Rv 1:20 As for the mystery of the seven stars that you saw in my right hand, and the seven golden lampstands, the seven stars are the angels of the seven churches, and the seven lampstands are the seven churches.
66Rv 2:1 "To the angel of the church in Ephesus write: 'The words of him who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks among the seven golden lampstands.
66Rv 2:2 "'I know your works, your toil and your patient endurance, and how you cannot bear with those who are evil, but have tested those who call themselves apostles and are not, and found them to be false.
66Rv 2:3 I know you are enduring patiently and bearing up for my name's sake, and you have not grown weary.
66Rv 2:4 But I have this against you, that you have abandoned the love you had at first.
66Rv 2:5 Remember therefore from where you have fallen; repent, and do the works you did at first. If not, I will come to you and remove your lampstand from its place, unless you repent.
66Rv 2:6 Yet this you have: you hate the works of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate.
66Rv 2:7 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will grant to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.'
66Rv 2:8 "And to the angel of the church in Smyrna write: 'The words of the first and the last, who died and came to life.
66Rv 2:9 "'I know your tribulation and your poverty (but you are rich) and the slander of those who say that they are Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan.
66Rv 2:10 Do not fear what you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested, and for ten days you will have tribulation. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.
66Rv 2:11 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. The one who conquers will not be hurt by the second death.'
66Rv 2:12 "And to the angel of the church in Pergamum write: 'The words of him who has the sharp two-edged sword.
66Rv 2:13 "'I know where you dwell, where Satan's throne is. Yet you hold fast my name, and you did not deny my faith even in the days of Antipas my faithful witness, who was killed among you, where Satan dwells.
66Rv 2:14 But I have a few things against you: you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, so that they might eat food sacrificed to idols and practice sexual immorality.
66Rv 2:15 So also you have some who hold the teaching of the Nicolaitans.
66Rv 2:16 Therefore repent. If not, I will come to you soon and war against them with the sword of my mouth.
66Rv 2:17 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To the one who conquers I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, with a new name written on the stone that no one knows except the one who receives it.'
66Rv 2:18 "And to the angel of the church in Thyatira write: 'The words of the Son of God, who has eyes like a flame of fire, and whose feet are like burnished bronze.
66Rv 2:19 "'I know your works, your love and faith and service and patient endurance, and that your latter works exceed the first.
66Rv 2:20 But I have this against you, that you tolerate that woman Jezebel, who calls herself a prophetess and is teaching and seducing my servants to practice sexual immorality and to eat food sacrificed to idols.
66Rv 2:21 I gave her time to repent, but she refuses to repent of her sexual immorality.
66Rv 2:22 Behold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery with her I will throw into great tribulation, unless they repent of her works,
66Rv 2:23 and I will strike her children dead. And all the churches will know that I am he who searches mind and heart, and I will give to each of you according to your works.
66Rv 2:24 But to the rest of you in Thyatira, who do not hold this teaching, who have not learned what some call the deep things of Satan, to you I say, I do not lay on you any other burden.
66Rv 2:25 Only hold fast what you have until I come.
66Rv 2:26 The one who conquers and who keeps my works until the end, to him I will give authority over the nations,
66Rv 2:27 and he will rule them with a rod of iron, as when earthen pots are broken in pieces, even as I myself have received authority from my Father.
66Rv 2:28 And I will give him the morning star.
66Rv 2:29 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'
66Rv 3:1 "And to the angel of the church in Sardis write: 'The words of him who has the seven spirits of God and the seven stars. "'I know your works. You have the reputation of being alive, but you are dead.
66Rv 3:2 Wake up, and strengthen what remains and is about to die, for I have not found your works complete in the sight of my God.
66Rv 3:3 Remember, then, what you received and heard. Keep it, and repent. If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at what hour I will come against you.
66Rv 3:4 Yet you have still a few names in Sardis, people who have not soiled their garments, and they will walk with me in white, for they are worthy.
66Rv 3:5 The one who conquers will be clothed thus in white garments, and I will never blot his name out of the book of life. I will confess his name before my Father and before his angels.
66Rv 3:6 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'
66Rv 3:7 "And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write: 'The words of the holy one, the true one, who has the key of David, who opens and no one will shut, who shuts and no one opens.
66Rv 3:8 "'I know your works. Behold, I have set before you an open door, which no one is able to shut. I know that you have but little power, and yet you have kept my word and have not denied my name.
66Rv 3:9 Behold, I will make those of the synagogue of Satan who say that they are Jews and are not, but lie--behold, I will make them come and bow down before your feet and they will learn that I have loved you.
66Rv 3:10 Because you have kept my word about patient endurance, I will keep you from the hour of trial that is coming on the whole world, to try those who dwell on the earth.
66Rv 3:11 I am coming soon. Hold fast what you have, so that no one may seize your crown.
66Rv 3:12 The one who conquers, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God. Never shall he go out of it, and I will write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the new Jerusalem, which comes down from my God out of heaven, and my own new name.
66Rv 3:13 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'
66Rv 3:14 "And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write: 'The words of the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's creation.
66Rv 3:15 "'I know your works: you are neither cold nor hot. Would that you were either cold or hot!
66Rv 3:16 So, because you are lukewarm, and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth.
66Rv 3:17 For you say, I am rich, I have prospered, and I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.
66Rv 3:18 I counsel you to buy from me gold refined by fire, so that you may be rich, and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen, and salve to anoint your eyes, so that you may see.
66Rv 3:19 Those whom I love, I reprove and discipline, so be zealous and repent.
66Rv 3:20 Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.
66Rv 3:21 The one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with me on my throne, as I also conquered and sat down with my Father on his throne.
66Rv 3:22 He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches.'"
66Rv 4:1 After this I looked, and behold, a door standing open in heaven! And the first voice, which I had heard speaking to me like a trumpet, said, "Come up here, and I will show you what must take place after this."
66Rv 4:2 At once I was in the Spirit, and behold, a throne stood in heaven, with one seated on the throne.
66Rv 4:3 And he who sat there had the appearance of jasper and carnelian, and around the throne was a rainbow that had the appearance of an emerald.
66Rv 4:4 Around the throne were twenty-four thrones, and seated on the thrones were twenty-four elders, clothed in white garments, with golden crowns on their heads.
66Rv 4:5 From the throne came flashes of lightning, and rumblings and peals of thunder, and before the throne were burning seven torches of fire, which are the seven spirits of God,
66Rv 4:6 and before the throne there was as it were a sea of glass, like crystal. And around the throne, on each side of the throne, are four living creatures, full of eyes in front and behind:
66Rv 4:7 the first living creature like a lion, the second living creature like an ox, the third living creature with the face of a man, and the fourth living creature like an eagle in flight.
66Rv 4:8 And the four living creatures, each of them with six wings, are full of eyes all around and within, and day and night they never cease to say, "Holy, holy, holy, is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come!"
66Rv 4:9 And whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to him who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever,
66Rv 4:10 the twenty-four elders fall down before him who is seated on the throne and worship him who lives forever and ever. They cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
66Rv 4:11 "Worthy are you, our Lord and God, to receive glory and honor and power, for you created all things, and by your will they existed and were created."
66Rv 5:1 Then I saw in the right hand of him who was seated on the throne a scroll written within and on the back, sealed with seven seals.
66Rv 5:2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, "Who is worthy to open the scroll and break its seals?"
66Rv 5:3 And no one in heaven or on earth or under the earth was able to open the scroll or to look into it,
66Rv 5:4 and I began to weep loudly because no one was found worthy to open the scroll or to look into it.
66Rv 5:5 And one of the elders said to me, "Weep no more; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has conquered, so that he can open the scroll and its seven seals."
66Rv 5:6 And between the throne and the four living creatures and among the elders I saw a Lamb standing, as though it had been slain, with seven horns and with seven eyes, which are the seven spirits of God sent out into all the earth.
66Rv 5:7 And he went and took the scroll from the right hand of him who was seated on the throne.
66Rv 5:8 And when he had taken the scroll, the four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell down before the Lamb, each holding a harp, and golden bowls full of incense, which are the prayers of the saints.
66Rv 5:9 And they sang a new song, saying, "Worthy are you to take the scroll and to open its seals, for you were slain, and by your blood you ransomed people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation,
66Rv 5:10 and you have made them a kingdom and priests to our God, and they shall reign on the earth."
66Rv 5:11 Then I looked, and I heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and thousands of thousands,
66Rv 5:12 saying with a loud voice, "Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing!"
66Rv 5:13 And I heard every creature in heaven and on earth and under the earth and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying, "To him who sits on the throne and to the Lamb be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever!"
66Rv 5:14 And the four living creatures said, "Amen!" and the elders fell down and worshiped.
66Rv 6:1 Now I watched when the Lamb opened one of the seven seals, and I heard one of the four living creatures say with a voice like thunder, "Come!"
66Rv 6:2 And I looked, and behold, a white horse! And its rider had a bow, and a crown was given to him, and he came out conquering, and to conquer.
66Rv 6:3 When he opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, "Come!"
66Rv 6:4 And out came another horse, bright red. Its rider was permitted to take peace from the earth, so that people should slay one another, and he was given a great sword.
66Rv 6:5 When he opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, "Come!" And I looked, and behold, a black horse! And its rider had a pair of scales in his hand.
66Rv 6:6 And I heard what seemed to be a voice in the midst of the four living creatures, saying, "A quart of wheat for a denarius, and three quarts of barley for a denarius, and do not harm the oil and wine!"
66Rv 6:7 When he opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of the fourth living creature say, "Come!"
66Rv 6:8 And I looked, and behold, a pale horse! And its rider's name was Death, and Hades followed him. And they were given authority over a fourth of the earth, to kill with sword and with famine and with pestilence and by wild beasts of the earth.
66Rv 6:9 When he opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar the souls of those who had been slain for the word of God and for the witness they had borne.
66Rv 6:10 They cried out with a loud voice, "O Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth?"
66Rv 6:11 Then they were each given a white robe and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who were to be killed as they themselves had been.
66Rv 6:12 When he opened the sixth seal, I looked, and behold, there was a great earthquake, and the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like blood,
66Rv 6:13 and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale.
66Rv 6:14 The sky vanished like a scroll that is being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.
66Rv 6:15 Then the kings of the earth and the great ones and the generals and the rich and the powerful, and everyone, slave and free, hid themselves in the caves and among the rocks of the mountains,
66Rv 6:16 calling to the mountains and rocks, "Fall on us and hide us from the face of him who is seated on the throne, and from the wrath of the Lamb,
66Rv 6:17 for the great day of their wrath has come, and who can stand?"
66Rv 7:1 After this I saw four angels standing at the four corners of the earth, holding back the four winds of the earth, that no wind might blow on earth or sea or against any tree.
66Rv 7:2 Then I saw another angel ascending from the rising of the sun, with the seal of the living God, and he called with a loud voice to the four angels who had been given power to harm earth and sea,
66Rv 7:3 saying, "Do not harm the earth or the sea or the trees, until we have sealed the servants of our God on their foreheads."
66Rv 7:4 And I heard the number of the sealed, 144,000, sealed from every tribe of the sons of Israel:
66Rv 7:5 12,000 from the tribe of Judah were sealed, 12,000 from the tribe of Reuben, 12,000 from the tribe of Gad,
66Rv 7:6 12,000 from the tribe of Asher, 12,000 from the tribe of Naphtali, 12,000 from the tribe of Manasseh,
66Rv 7:7 12,000 from the tribe of Simeon, 12,000 from the tribe of Levi, 12,000 from the tribe of Issachar,
66Rv 7:8 12,000 from the tribe of Zebulun, 12,000 from the tribe of Joseph, 12,000 from the tribe of Benjamin were sealed.
66Rv 7:9 After this I looked, and behold, a great multitude that no one could number, from every nation, from all tribes and peoples and languages, standing before the throne and before the Lamb, clothed in white robes, with palm branches in their hands,
66Rv 7:10 and crying out with a loud voice, "Salvation belongs to our God who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb!"
66Rv 7:11 And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures, and they fell on their faces before the throne and worshiped God,
66Rv 7:12 saying, "Amen! Blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever! Amen."
66Rv 7:13 Then one of the elders addressed me, saying, "Who are these, clothed in white robes, and from where have they come?"
66Rv 7:14 I said to him, "Sir, you know." And he said to me, "These are the ones coming out of the great tribulation. They have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the Lamb.
66Rv 7:15 "Therefore they are before the throne of God, and serve him day and night in his temple; and he who sits on the throne will shelter them with his presence.
66Rv 7:16 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst anymore; the sun shall not strike them, nor any scorching heat.
66Rv 7:17 For the Lamb in the midst of the throne will be their shepherd, and he will guide them to springs of living water, and God will wipe away every tear from their eyes."
66Rv 8:1 When the Lamb opened the seventh seal, there was silence in heaven for about half an hour.
66Rv 8:2 Then I saw the seven angels who stand before God, and seven trumpets were given to them.
66Rv 8:3 And another angel came and stood at the altar with a golden censer, and he was given much incense to offer with the prayers of all the saints on the golden altar before the throne,
66Rv 8:4 and the smoke of the incense, with the prayers of the saints, rose before God from the hand of the angel.
66Rv 8:5 Then the angel took the censer and filled it with fire from the altar and threw it on the earth, and there were peals of thunder, rumblings, flashes of lightning, and an earthquake.
66Rv 8:6 Now the seven angels who had the seven trumpets prepared to blow them.
66Rv 8:7 The first angel blew his trumpet, and there followed hail and fire, mixed with blood, and these were thrown upon the earth. And a third of the earth was burned up, and a third of the trees were burned up, and all green grass was burned up.
66Rv 8:8 The second angel blew his trumpet, and something like a great mountain, burning with fire, was thrown into the sea, and a third of the sea became blood.
66Rv 8:9 A third of the living creatures in the sea died, and a third of the ships were destroyed.
66Rv 8:10 The third angel blew his trumpet, and a great star fell from heaven, blazing like a torch, and it fell on a third of the rivers and on the springs of water.
66Rv 8:11 The name of the star is Wormwood. A third of the waters became wormwood, and many people died from the water, because it had been made bitter.
66Rv 8:12 The fourth angel blew his trumpet, and a third of the sun was struck, and a third of the moon, and a third of the stars, so that a third of their light might be darkened, and a third of the day might be kept from shining, and likewise a third of the night.
66Rv 8:13 Then I looked, and I heard an eagle crying with a loud voice as it flew directly overhead, "Woe, woe, woe to those who dwell on the earth, at the blasts of the other trumpets that the three angels are about to blow!"
66Rv 9:1 And the fifth angel blew his trumpet, and I saw a star fallen from heaven to earth, and he was given the key to the shaft of the bottomless pit.
66Rv 9:2 He opened the shaft of the bottomless pit, and from the shaft rose smoke like the smoke of a great furnace, and the sun and the air were darkened with the smoke from the shaft.
66Rv 9:3 Then from the smoke came locusts on the earth, and they were given power like the power of scorpions of the earth.
66Rv 9:4 They were told not to harm the grass of the earth or any green plant or any tree, but only those people who do not have the seal of God on their foreheads.
66Rv 9:5 They were allowed to torment them for five months, but not to kill them, and their torment was like the torment of a scorpion when it stings someone.
66Rv 9:6 And in those days people will seek death and will not find it. They will long to die, but death will flee from them.
66Rv 9:7 In appearance the locusts were like horses prepared for battle: on their heads were what looked like crowns of gold; their faces were like human faces,
66Rv 9:8 their hair like women's hair, and their teeth like lions' teeth;
66Rv 9:9 they had breastplates like breastplates of iron, and the noise of their wings was like the noise of many chariots with horses rushing into battle.
66Rv 9:10 They have tails and stings like scorpions, and their power to hurt people for five months is in their tails.
66Rv 9:11 They have as king over them the angel of the bottomless pit. His name in Hebrew is Abaddon, and in Greek he is called Apollyon.
66Rv 9:12 The first woe has passed; behold, two woes are still to come.
66Rv 9:13 Then the sixth angel blew his trumpet, and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar before God,
66Rv 9:14 saying to the sixth angel who had the trumpet, "Release the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates."
66Rv 9:15 So the four angels, who had been prepared for the hour, the day, the month, and the year, were released to kill a third of mankind.
66Rv 9:16 The number of mounted troops was twice ten thousand times ten thousand; I heard their number.
66Rv 9:17 And this is how I saw the horses in my vision and those who rode them: they wore breastplates the color of fire and of sapphire and of sulfur, and the heads of the horses were like lions' heads, and fire and smoke and sulfur came out of their mouths.
66Rv 9:18 By these three plagues a third of mankind was killed, by the fire and smoke and sulfur coming out of their mouths.
66Rv 9:19 For the power of the horses is in their mouths and in their tails, for their tails are like serpents with heads, and by means of them they wound.
66Rv 9:20 The rest of mankind, who were not killed by these plagues, did not repent of the works of their hands nor give up worshiping demons and idols of gold and silver and bronze and stone and wood, which cannot see or hear or walk,
66Rv 9:21 nor did they repent of their murders or their sorceries or their sexual immorality or their thefts.
66Rv 10:1 Then I saw another mighty angel coming down from heaven, wrapped in a cloud, with a rainbow over his head, and his face was like the sun, and his legs like pillars of fire.
66Rv 10:2 He had a little scroll open in his hand. And he set his right foot on the sea, and his left foot on the land,
66Rv 10:3 and called out with a loud voice, like a lion roaring. When he called out, the seven thunders sounded.
66Rv 10:4 And when the seven thunders had sounded, I was about to write, but I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Seal up what the seven thunders have said, and do not write it down."
66Rv 10:5 And the angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised his right hand to heaven
66Rv 10:6 and swore by him who lives forever and ever, who created heaven and what is in it, the earth and what is in it, and the sea and what is in it, that there would be no more delay,
66Rv 10:7 but that in the days of the trumpet call to be sounded by the seventh angel, the mystery of God would be fulfilled, just as he announced to his servants the prophets.
66Rv 10:8 Then the voice that I had heard from heaven spoke to me again, saying, "Go, take the scroll that is open in the hand of the angel who is standing on the sea and on the land."
66Rv 10:9 So I went to the angel and told him to give me the little scroll. And he said to me, "Take and eat it; it will make your stomach bitter, but in your mouth it will be sweet as honey."
66Rv 10:10 And I took the little scroll from the hand of the angel and ate it. It was sweet as honey in my mouth, but when I had eaten it my stomach was made bitter.
66Rv 10:11 And I was told, "You must again prophesy about many peoples and nations and languages and kings."
66Rv 11:1 Then I was given a measuring rod like a staff, and I was told, "Rise and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship there,
66Rv 11:2 but do not measure the court outside the temple; leave that out, for it is given over to the nations, and they will trample the holy city for forty-two months.
66Rv 11:3 And I will grant authority to my two witnesses, and they will prophesy for 1,260 days, clothed in sackcloth."
66Rv 11:4 These are the two olive trees and the two lampstands that stand before the Lord of the earth.
66Rv 11:5 And if anyone would harm them, fire pours from their mouth and consumes their foes. If anyone would harm them, this is how he is doomed to be killed.
66Rv 11:6 They have the power to shut the sky, that no rain may fall during the days of their prophesying, and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to strike the earth with every kind of plague, as often as they desire.
66Rv 11:7 And when they have finished their testimony, the beast that rises from the bottomless pit will make war on them and conquer them and kill them,
66Rv 11:8 and their dead bodies will lie in the street of the great city that symbolically is called Sodom and Egypt, where their Lord was crucified.
66Rv 11:9 For three and a half days some from the peoples and tribes and languages and nations will gaze at their dead bodies and refuse to let them be placed in a tomb,
66Rv 11:10 and those who dwell on the earth will rejoice over them and make merry and exchange presents, because these two prophets had been a torment to those who dwell on the earth.
66Rv 11:11 But after the three and a half days a breath of life from God entered them, and they stood up on their feet, and great fear fell on those who saw them.
66Rv 11:12 Then they heard a loud voice from heaven saying to them, "Come up here!" And they went up to heaven in a cloud, and their enemies watched them.
66Rv 11:13 And at that hour there was a great earthquake, and a tenth of the city fell. Seven thousand people were killed in the earthquake, and the rest were terrified and gave glory to the God of heaven.
66Rv 11:14 The second woe has passed; behold, the third woe is soon to come.
66Rv 11:15 Then the seventh angel blew his trumpet, and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, "The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ, and he shall reign forever and ever."
66Rv 11:16 And the twenty-four elders who sit on their thrones before God fell on their faces and worshiped God,
66Rv 11:17 saying, "We give thanks to you, Lord God Almighty, who is and who was, for you have taken your great power and begun to reign.
66Rv 11:18 The nations raged, but your wrath came, and the time for the dead to be judged, and for rewarding your servants, the prophets and saints, and those who fear your name, both small and great, and for destroying the destroyers of the earth."
66Rv 11:19 Then God's temple in heaven was opened, and the ark of his covenant was seen within his temple. There were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, an earthquake, and heavy hail.
66Rv 12:1 And a great sign appeared in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, with the moon under her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.
66Rv 12:2 She was pregnant and was crying out in birth pains and the agony of giving birth.
66Rv 12:3 And another sign appeared in heaven: behold, a great red dragon, with seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems.
66Rv 12:4 His tail swept down a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth. And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to give birth, so that when she bore her child he might devour it.
66Rv 12:5 She gave birth to a male child, one who is to rule all the nations with a rod of iron, but her child was caught up to God and to his throne,
66Rv 12:6 and the woman fled into the wilderness, where she has a place prepared by God, in which she is to be nourished for 1,260 days.
66Rv 12:7 Now war arose in heaven, Michael and his angels fighting against the dragon. And the dragon and his angels fought back,
66Rv 12:8 but he was defeated, and there was no longer any place for them in heaven.
66Rv 12:9 And the great dragon was thrown down, that ancient serpent, who is called the devil and Satan, the deceiver of the whole world--he was thrown down to the earth, and his angels were thrown down with him.
66Rv 12:10 And I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, "Now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, who accuses them day and night before our God.
66Rv 12:11 And they have conquered him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony, for they loved not their lives even unto death.
66Rv 12:12 Therefore, rejoice, O heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to you, O earth and sea, for the devil has come down to you in great wrath, because he knows that his time is short!"
66Rv 12:13 And when the dragon saw that he had been thrown down to the earth, he pursued the woman who had given birth to the male child.
66Rv 12:14 But the woman was given the two wings of the great eagle so that she might fly from the serpent into the wilderness, to the place where she is to be nourished for a time, and times, and half a time.
66Rv 12:15 The serpent poured water like a river out of his mouth after the woman, to sweep her away with a flood.
66Rv 12:16 But the earth came to the help of the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river that the dragon had poured from his mouth.
66Rv 12:17 Then the dragon became furious with the woman and went off to make war on the rest of her offspring, on those who keep the commandments of God and hold to the testimony of Jesus. And he stood on the sand of the sea.
66Rv 13:1 And I saw a beast rising out of the sea, with ten horns and seven heads, with ten diadems on its horns and blasphemous names on its heads.
66Rv 13:2 And the beast that I saw was like a leopard; its feet were like a bear's, and its mouth was like a lion's mouth. And to it the dragon gave his power and his throne and great authority.
66Rv 13:3 One of its heads seemed to have a mortal wound, but its mortal wound was healed, and the whole earth marveled as they followed the beast.
66Rv 13:4 And they worshiped the dragon, for he had given his authority to the beast, and they worshiped the beast, saying, "Who is like the beast, and who can fight against it?"
66Rv 13:5 And the beast was given a mouth uttering haughty and blasphemous words, and it was allowed to exercise authority for forty-two months.
66Rv 13:6 It opened its mouth to utter blasphemies against God, blaspheming his name and his dwelling, that is, those who dwell in heaven.
66Rv 13:7 Also it was allowed to make war on the saints and to conquer them. And authority was given it over every tribe and people and language and nation,
66Rv 13:8 and all who dwell on earth will worship it, everyone whose name has not been written before the foundation of the world in the book of life of the Lamb who was slain.
66Rv 13:9 If anyone has an ear, let him hear:
66Rv 13:10 If anyone is to be taken captive, to captivity he goes; if anyone is to be slain with the sword, with the sword must he be slain. Here is a call for the endurance and faith of the saints.
66Rv 13:11 Then I saw another beast rising out of the earth. It had two horns like a lamb and it spoke like a dragon.
66Rv 13:12 It exercises all the authority of the first beast in its presence, and makes the earth and its inhabitants worship the first beast, whose mortal wound was healed.
66Rv 13:13 It performs great signs, even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people,
66Rv 13:14 and by the signs that it is allowed to work in the presence of the beast it deceives those who dwell on earth, telling them to make an image for the beast that was wounded by the sword and yet lived.
66Rv 13:15 And it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast, so that the image of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast to be slain.
66Rv 13:16 Also it causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to be marked on the right hand or the forehead,
66Rv 13:17 so that no one can buy or sell unless he has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of its name.
66Rv 13:18 This calls for wisdom: let the one who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man, and his number is 666.
66Rv 14:1 Then I looked, and behold, on Mount Zion stood the Lamb, and with him 144,000 who had his name and his Father's name written on their foreheads.
66Rv 14:2 And I heard a voice from heaven like the roar of many waters and like the sound of loud thunder. The voice I heard was like the sound of harpists playing on their harps,
66Rv 14:3 and they were singing a new song before the throne and before the four living creatures and before the elders. No one could learn that song except the 144,000 who had been redeemed from the earth.
66Rv 14:4 It is these who have not defiled themselves with women, for they are virgins. It is these who follow the Lamb wherever he goes. These have been redeemed from mankind as firstfruits for God and the Lamb,
66Rv 14:5 and in their mouth no lie was found, for they are blameless.
66Rv 14:6 Then I saw another angel flying directly overhead, with an eternal gospel to proclaim to those who dwell on earth, to every nation and tribe and language and people.
66Rv 14:7 And he said with a loud voice, "Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come, and worship him who made heaven and earth, the sea and the springs of water."
66Rv 14:8 Another angel, a second, followed, saying, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great, she who made all nations drink the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality."
66Rv 14:9 And another angel, a third, followed them, saying with a loud voice, "If anyone worships the beast and its image and receives a mark on his forehead or on his hand,
66Rv 14:10 he also will drink the wine of God's wrath, poured full strength into the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and sulfur in the presence of the holy angels and in the presence of the Lamb.
66Rv 14:11 And the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest, day or night, these worshipers of the beast and its image, and whoever receives the mark of its name."
66Rv 14:12 Here is a call for the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and their faith in Jesus.
66Rv 14:13 And I heard a voice from heaven saying, "Write this: Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on." "Blessed indeed," says the Spirit, "that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them!"
66Rv 14:14 Then I looked, and behold, a white cloud, and seated on the cloud one like a son of man, with a golden crown on his head, and a sharp sickle in his hand.
66Rv 14:15 And another angel came out of the temple, calling with a loud voice to him who sat on the cloud, "Put in your sickle, and reap, for the hour to reap has come, for the harvest of the earth is fully ripe."
66Rv 14:16 So he who sat on the cloud swung his sickle across the earth, and the earth was reaped.
66Rv 14:17 Then another angel came out of the temple in heaven, and he too had a sharp sickle.
66Rv 14:18 And another angel came out from the altar, the angel who has authority over the fire, and he called with a loud voice to the one who had the sharp sickle, "Put in your sickle and gather the clusters from the vine of the earth, for its grapes are ripe."
66Rv 14:19 So the angel swung his sickle across the earth and gathered the grape harvest of the earth and threw it into the great winepress of the wrath of God.
66Rv 14:20 And the winepress was trodden outside the city, and blood flowed from the winepress, as high as a horse's bridle, for 1,600 stadia.
66Rv 15:1 Then I saw another sign in heaven, great and amazing, seven angels with seven plagues, which are the last, for with them the wrath of God is finished.
66Rv 15:2 And I saw what appeared to be a sea of glass mingled with fire--and also those who had conquered the beast and its image and the number of its name, standing beside the sea of glass with harps of God in their hands.
66Rv 15:3 And they sing the song of Moses, the servant of God, and the song of the Lamb, saying, "Great and amazing are your deeds, O Lord God the Almighty! Just and true are your ways, O King of the nations!
66Rv 15:4 Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify your name? For you alone are holy. All nations will come and worship you, for your righteous acts have been revealed."
66Rv 15:5 After this I looked, and the sanctuary of the tent of witness in heaven was opened,
66Rv 15:6 and out of the sanctuary came the seven angels with the seven plagues, clothed in pure, bright linen, with golden sashes around their chests.
66Rv 15:7 And one of the four living creatures gave to the seven angels seven golden bowls full of the wrath of God who lives forever and ever,
66Rv 15:8 and the sanctuary was filled with smoke from the glory of God and from his power, and no one could enter the sanctuary until the seven plagues of the seven angels were finished.
66Rv 16:1 Then I heard a loud voice from the temple telling the seven angels, "Go and pour out on the earth the seven bowls of the wrath of God."
66Rv 16:2 So the first angel went and poured out his bowl on the earth, and harmful and painful sores came upon the people who bore the mark of the beast and worshiped its image.
66Rv 16:3 The second angel poured out his bowl into the sea, and it became like the blood of a corpse, and every living thing died that was in the sea.
66Rv 16:4 The third angel poured out his bowl into the rivers and the springs of water, and they became blood.
66Rv 16:5 And I heard the angel in charge of the waters say, "Just are you, O Holy One, who is and who was, for you brought these judgments.
66Rv 16:6 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and you have given them blood to drink. It is what they deserve!"
66Rv 16:7 And I heard the altar saying, "Yes, Lord God the Almighty, true and just are your judgments!"
66Rv 16:8 The fourth angel poured out his bowl on the sun, and it was allowed to scorch people with fire.
66Rv 16:9 They were scorched by the fierce heat, and they cursed the name of God who had power over these plagues. They did not repent and give him glory.
66Rv 16:10 The fifth angel poured out his bowl on the throne of the beast, and its kingdom was plunged into darkness. People gnawed their tongues in anguish
66Rv 16:11 and cursed the God of heaven for their pain and sores. They did not repent of their deeds.
66Rv 16:12 The sixth angel poured out his bowl on the great river Euphrates, and its water was dried up, to prepare the way for the kings from the east.
66Rv 16:13 And I saw, coming out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits like frogs.
66Rv 16:14 For they are demonic spirits, performing signs, who go abroad to the kings of the whole world, to assemble them for battle on the great day of God the Almighty.
66Rv 16:15 ("Behold, I am coming like a thief! Blessed is the one who stays awake, keeping his garments on, that he may not go about naked and be seen exposed!")
66Rv 16:16 And they assembled them at the place that in Hebrew is called Armageddon.
66Rv 16:17 The seventh angel poured out his bowl into the air, and a loud voice came out of the temple, from the throne, saying, "It is done!"
66Rv 16:18 And there were flashes of lightning, rumblings, peals of thunder, and a great earthquake such as there had never been since man was on the earth, so great was that earthquake.
66Rv 16:19 The great city was split into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell, and God remembered Babylon the great, to make her drain the cup of the wine of the fury of his wrath.
66Rv 16:20 And every island fled away, and no mountains were to be found.
66Rv 16:21 And great hailstones, about one hundred pounds each, fell from heaven on people; and they cursed God for the plague of the hail, because the plague was so severe.
66Rv 17:1 Then one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls came and said to me, "Come, I will show you the judgment of the great prostitute who is seated on many waters,
66Rv 17:2 with whom the kings of the earth have committed sexual immorality, and with the wine of whose sexual immorality the dwellers on earth have become drunk."
66Rv 17:3 And he carried me away in the Spirit into a wilderness, and I saw a woman sitting on a scarlet beast that was full of blasphemous names, and it had seven heads and ten horns.
66Rv 17:4 The woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet, and adorned with gold and jewels and pearls, holding in her hand a golden cup full of abominations and the impurities of her sexual immorality.
66Rv 17:5 And on her forehead was written a name of mystery: "Babylon the great, mother of prostitutes and of earth's abominations."
66Rv 17:6 And I saw the woman, drunk with the blood of the saints, the blood of the martyrs of Jesus. When I saw her, I marveled greatly.
66Rv 17:7 But the angel said to me, "Why do you marvel? I will tell you the mystery of the woman, and of the beast with seven heads and ten horns that carries her.
66Rv 17:8 The beast that you saw was, and is not, and is about to rise from the bottomless pit and go to destruction. And the dwellers on earth whose names have not been written in the book of life from the foundation of the world will marvel to see the beast, because it was and is not and is to come.
66Rv 17:9 This calls for a mind with wisdom: the seven heads are seven mountains on which the woman is seated;
66Rv 17:10 they are also seven kings, five of whom have fallen, one is, the other has not yet come, and when he does come he must remain only a little while.
66Rv 17:11 As for the beast that was and is not, it is an eighth but it belongs to the seven, and it goes to destruction.
66Rv 17:12 And the ten horns that you saw are ten kings who have not yet received royal power, but they are to receive authority as kings for one hour, together with the beast.
66Rv 17:13 These are of one mind, and they hand over their power and authority to the beast.
66Rv 17:14 They will make war on the Lamb, and the Lamb will conquer them, for he is Lord of lords and King of kings, and those with him are called and chosen and faithful."
66Rv 17:15 And the angel said to me, "The waters that you saw, where the prostitute is seated, are peoples and multitudes and nations and languages.
66Rv 17:16 And the ten horns that you saw, they and the beast will hate the prostitute. They will make her desolate and naked, and devour her flesh and burn her up with fire,
66Rv 17:17 for God has put it into their hearts to carry out his purpose by being of one mind and handing over their royal power to the beast, until the words of God are fulfilled.
66Rv 17:18 And the woman that you saw is the great city that has dominion over the kings of the earth."
66Rv 18:1 After this I saw another angel coming down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was made bright with his glory.
66Rv 18:2 And he called out with a mighty voice, "Fallen, fallen is Babylon the great! She has become a dwelling place for demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a haunt for every unclean and detestable beast.
66Rv 18:3 For all nations have drunk the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her, and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of her luxurious living."
66Rv 18:4 Then I heard another voice from heaven saying, "Come out of her, my people, lest you take part in her sins, lest you share in her plagues;
66Rv 18:5 for her sins are heaped high as heaven, and God has remembered her iniquities.
66Rv 18:6 Pay her back as she herself has paid back others, and repay her double for her deeds; mix a double portion for her in the cup she mixed.
66Rv 18:7 As she glorified herself and lived in luxury, so give her a like measure of torment and mourning, since in her heart she says, 'I sit as a queen, I am no widow, and mourning I shall never see.'
66Rv 18:8 For this reason her plagues will come in a single day, death and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire; for mighty is the Lord God who has judged her."
66Rv 18:9 And the kings of the earth, who committed sexual immorality and lived in luxury with her, will weep and wail over her when they see the smoke of her burning.
66Rv 18:10 They will stand far off, in fear of her torment, and say, "Alas! Alas! You great city, you mighty city, Babylon! For in a single hour your judgment has come."
66Rv 18:11 And the merchants of the earth weep and mourn for her, since no one buys their cargo anymore,
66Rv 18:12 cargo of gold, silver, jewels, pearls, fine linen, purple cloth, silk, scarlet cloth, all kinds of scented wood, all kinds of articles of ivory, all kinds of articles of costly wood, bronze, iron and marble,
66Rv 18:13 cinnamon, spice, incense, myrrh, frankincense, wine, oil, fine flour, wheat, cattle and sheep, horses and chariots, and slaves, that is, human souls.
66Rv 18:14 "The fruit for which your soul longed has gone from you, and all your delicacies and your splendors are lost to you, never to be found again!"
66Rv 18:15 The merchants of these wares, who gained wealth from her, will stand far off, in fear of her torment, weeping and mourning aloud,
66Rv 18:16 "Alas, alas, for the great city that was clothed in fine linen, in purple and scarlet, adorned with gold, with jewels, and with pearls!
66Rv 18:17 For in a single hour all this wealth has been laid waste." And all shipmasters and seafaring men, sailors and all whose trade is on the sea, stood far off
66Rv 18:18 and cried out as they saw the smoke of her burning, "What city was like the great city?"
66Rv 18:19 And they threw dust on their heads as they wept and mourned, crying out, "Alas, alas, for the great city where all who had ships at sea grew rich by her wealth! For in a single hour she has been laid waste.
66Rv 18:20 Rejoice over her, O heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, for God has given judgment for you against her!"
66Rv 18:21 Then a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone and threw it into the sea, saying, "So will Babylon the great city be thrown down with violence, and will be found no more;
66Rv 18:22 and the sound of harpists and musicians, of flute players and trumpeters, will be heard in you no more, and a craftsman of any craft will be found in you no more, and the sound of the mill will be heard in you no more,
66Rv 18:23 and the light of a lamp will shine in you no more, and the voice of bridegroom and bride will be heard in you no more, for your merchants were the great ones of the earth, and all nations were deceived by your sorcery.
66Rv 18:24 And in her was found the blood of prophets and of saints, and of all who have been slain on earth."
66Rv 19:1 After this I heard what seemed to be the loud voice of a great multitude in heaven, crying out, "Hallelujah! Salvation and glory and power belong to our God,
66Rv 19:2 for his judgments are true and just; for he has judged the great prostitute who corrupted the earth with her immorality, and has avenged on her the blood of his servants."
66Rv 19:3 Once more they cried out, "Hallelujah! The smoke from her goes up forever and ever."
66Rv 19:4 And the twenty-four elders and the four living creatures fell down and worshiped God who was seated on the throne, saying, "Amen. Hallelujah!"
66Rv 19:5 And from the throne came a voice saying, "Praise our God, all you his servants, you who fear him, small and great."
66Rv 19:6 Then I heard what seemed to be the voice of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters and like the sound of mighty peals of thunder, crying out, "Hallelujah! For the Lord our God the Almighty reigns.
66Rv 19:7 Let us rejoice and exult and give him the glory, for the marriage of the Lamb has come, and his Bride has made herself ready;
66Rv 19:8 it was granted her to clothe herself with fine linen, bright and pure"-- for the fine linen is the righteous deeds of the saints.
66Rv 19:9 And the angel said to me, "Write this: Blessed are those who are invited to the marriage supper of the Lamb." And he said to me, "These are the true words of God."
66Rv 19:10 Then I fell down at his feet to worship him, but he said to me, "You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers who hold to the testimony of Jesus. Worship God." For the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.
66Rv 19:11 Then I saw heaven opened, and behold, a white horse! The one sitting on it is called Faithful and True, and in righteousness he judges and makes war.
66Rv 19:12 His eyes are like a flame of fire, and on his head are many diadems, and he has a name written that no one knows but himself.
66Rv 19:13 He is clothed in a robe dipped in blood, and the name by which he is called is The Word of God.
66Rv 19:14 And the armies of heaven, arrayed in fine linen, white and pure, were following him on white horses.
66Rv 19:15 From his mouth comes a sharp sword with which to strike down the nations, and he will rule them with a rod of iron. He will tread the winepress of the fury of the wrath of God the Almighty.
66Rv 19:16 On his robe and on his thigh he has a name written, King of kings and Lord of lords.
66Rv 19:17 Then I saw an angel standing in the sun, and with a loud voice he called to all the birds that fly directly overhead, "Come, gather for the great supper of God,
66Rv 19:18 to eat the flesh of kings, the flesh of captains, the flesh of mighty men, the flesh of horses and their riders, and the flesh of all men, both free and slave, both small and great."
66Rv 19:19 And I saw the beast and the kings of the earth with their armies gathered to make war against him who was sitting on the horse and against his army.
66Rv 19:20 And the beast was captured, and with it the false prophet who in its presence had done the signs by which he deceived those who had received the mark of the beast and those who worshiped its image. These two were thrown alive into the lake of fire that burns with sulfur.
66Rv 19:21 And the rest were slain by the sword that came from the mouth of him who was sitting on the horse, and all the birds were gorged with their flesh.
66Rv 20:1 Then I saw an angel coming down from heaven, holding in his hand the key to the bottomless pit and a great chain.
66Rv 20:2 And he seized the dragon, that ancient serpent, who is the devil and Satan, and bound him for a thousand years,
66Rv 20:3 and threw him into the pit, and shut it and sealed it over him, so that he might not deceive the nations any longer, until the thousand years were ended. After that he must be released for a little while.
66Rv 20:4 Then I saw thrones, and seated on them were those to whom the authority to judge was committed. Also I saw the souls of those who had been beheaded for the testimony of Jesus and for the word of God, and those who had not worshiped the beast or its image and had not received its mark on their foreheads or their hands. They came to life and reigned with Christ for a thousand years.
66Rv 20:5 The rest of the dead did not come to life until the thousand years were ended. This is the first resurrection.
66Rv 20:6 Blessed and holy is the one who shares in the first resurrection! Over such the second death has no power, but they will be priests of God and of Christ, and they will reign with him for a thousand years.
66Rv 20:7 And when the thousand years are ended, Satan will be released from his prison
66Rv 20:8 and will come out to deceive the nations that are at the four corners of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them for battle; their number is like the sand of the sea.
66Rv 20:9 And they marched up over the broad plain of the earth and surrounded the camp of the saints and the beloved city, but fire came down from heaven and consumed them,
66Rv 20:10 and the devil who had deceived them was thrown into the lake of fire and sulfur where the beast and the false prophet were, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever.
66Rv 20:11 Then I saw a great white throne and him who was seated on it. From his presence earth and sky fled away, and no place was found for them.
66Rv 20:12 And I saw the dead, great and small, standing before the throne, and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life. And the dead were judged by what was written in the books, according to what they had done.
66Rv 20:13 And the sea gave up the dead who were in it, Death and Hades gave up the dead who were in them, and they were judged, each one of them, according to what they had done.
66Rv 20:14 Then Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire.
66Rv 20:15 And if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire.
66Rv 21:1 Then I saw a new heaven and a new earth, for the first heaven and the first earth had passed away, and the sea was no more.
66Rv 21:2 And I saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God, prepared as a bride adorned for her husband.
66Rv 21:3 And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, "Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God.
66Rv 21:4 He will wipe away every tear from their eyes, and death shall be no more, neither shall there be mourning, nor crying, nor pain anymore, for the former things have passed away."
66Rv 21:5 And he who was seated on the throne said, "Behold, I am making all things new." Also he said, "Write this down, for these words are trustworthy and true."
66Rv 21:6 And he said to me, "It is done! I am the Alpha and the Omega, the beginning and the end. To the thirsty I will give from the spring of the water of life without payment.
66Rv 21:7 The one who conquers will have this heritage, and I will be his God and he will be my son.
66Rv 21:8 But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable, as for murderers, the sexually immoral, sorcerers, idolaters, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur, which is the second death."
66Rv 21:9 Then came one of the seven angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues and spoke to me, saying, "Come, I will show you the Bride, the wife of the Lamb."
66Rv 21:10 And he carried me away in the Spirit to a great, high mountain, and showed me the holy city Jerusalem coming down out of heaven from God,
66Rv 21:11 having the glory of God, its radiance like a most rare jewel, like a jasper, clear as crystal.
66Rv 21:12 It had a great, high wall, with twelve gates, and at the gates twelve angels, and on the gates the names of the twelve tribes of the sons of Israel were inscribed--
66Rv 21:13 on the east three gates, on the north three gates, on the south three gates, and on the west three gates.
66Rv 21:14 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and on them were the twelve names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.
66Rv 21:15 And the one who spoke with me had a measuring rod of gold to measure the city and its gates and walls.
66Rv 21:16 The city lies foursquare, its length the same as its width. And he measured the city with his rod, 12,000 stadia. Its length and width and height are equal.
66Rv 21:17 He also measured its wall, 144 cubits by human measurement, which is also an angel's measurement.
66Rv 21:18 The wall was built of jasper, while the city was pure gold, clear as glass.
66Rv 21:19 The foundations of the wall of the city were adorned with every kind of jewel. The first was jasper, the second sapphire, the third agate, the fourth emerald,
66Rv 21:20 the fifth onyx, the sixth carnelian, the seventh chrysolite, the eighth beryl, the ninth topaz, the tenth chrysoprase, the eleventh jacinth, the twelfth amethyst.
66Rv 21:21 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls, each of the gates made of a single pearl, and the street of the city was pure gold, transparent as glass.
66Rv 21:22 And I saw no temple in the city, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb.
66Rv 21:23 And the city has no need of sun or moon to shine on it, for the glory of God gives it light, and its lamp is the Lamb.
66Rv 21:24 By its light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring their glory into it,
66Rv 21:25 and its gates will never be shut by day--and there will be no night there.
66Rv 21:26 They will bring into it the glory and the honor of the nations.
66Rv 21:27 But nothing unclean will ever enter it, nor anyone who does what is detestable or false, but only those who are written in the Lamb's book of life.
66Rv 22:1 Then the angel showed me the river of the water of life, bright as crystal, flowing from the throne of God and of the Lamb
66Rv 22:2 through the middle of the street of the city; also, on either side of the river, the tree of life with its twelve kinds of fruit, yielding its fruit each month. The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
66Rv 22:3 No longer will there be anything accursed, but the throne of God and of the Lamb will be in it, and his servants will worship him.
66Rv 22:4 They will see his face, and his name will be on their foreheads.
66Rv 22:5 And night will be no more. They will need no light of lamp or sun, for the Lord God will be their light, and they will reign forever and ever.
66Rv 22:6 And he said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true. And the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets, has sent his angel to show his servants what must soon take place."
66Rv 22:7 "And behold, I am coming soon. Blessed is the one who keeps the words of the prophecy of this book."
66Rv 22:8 I, John, am the one who heard and saw these things. And when I heard and saw them, I fell down to worship at the feet of the angel who showed them to me,
66Rv 22:9 but he said to me, "You must not do that! I am a fellow servant with you and your brothers the prophets, and with those who keep the words of this book. Worship God."
66Rv 22:10 And he said to me, "Do not seal up the words of the prophecy of this book, for the time is near.
66Rv 22:11 Let the evildoer still do evil, and the filthy still be filthy, and the righteous still do right, and the holy still be holy."
66Rv 22:12 "Behold, I am coming soon, bringing my recompense with me, to repay everyone for what he has done.
66Rv 22:13 I am the Alpha and the Omega, the first and the last, the beginning and the end."
66Rv 22:14 Blessed are those who wash their robes, so that they may have the right to the tree of life and that they may enter the city by the gates.
66Rv 22:15 Outside are the dogs and sorcerers and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters, and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
66Rv 22:16 "I, Jesus, have sent my angel to testify to you about these things for the churches. I am the root and the descendant of David, the bright morning star."
66Rv 22:17 The Spirit and the Bride say, "Come." And let the one who hears say, "Come." And let the one who is thirsty come; let the one who desires take the water of life without price.
66Rv 22:18 I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book,
66Rv 22:19 and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.
66Rv 22:20 He who testifies to these things says, "Surely I am coming soon." Amen. Come, Lord Jesus!
66Rv 22:21 The grace of the Lord Jesus be with all. Amen.
